"1108","DALEK"," You will move ahead of us and follow my directions. This way. Immediately.   I said immediately!   Fire! "
"1110","DALEK"," Stop! Your legs are paralysed. You will recover shortly unless you force us to use our weapons again. In that case, the condition will be permanent. You two, help him. "
"1112","DALEK"," Stop here. "
"1139","DALEK"," Bring in the old man Thal prisoner. Two hundred days ago the radiation count was ninety three. "
"1140","DALEK"," It is now fifty eight. An impressive reduction. "
"1141","DALEK"," It is still enough to destroy. Our prisoners are showing preliminary stages of sickness already. "
"1142","DALEK"," We know the Thals are able to live on the surface. "
"1143","DALEK"," And that they must have found immunity. "
"1144","DALEK"," Perhaps it is a drug. Is it failing them now? Why are these four showing signs of radiation sickness? "
"1145","DALEK"," A few questions will reduce the mystery.   Do not move out of the light. Sit on the floor. "
"1146","DALEK"," You are one of the Thal people? "
"1148","DALEK"," Why are you suffering from radiation? "
"1150","DALEK"," No, that is not true. We know the Thals have existed outside our city. "
"1151","DALEK"," The truth is your supply of drugs has failed, and you came into the city to see if you could find more. "
"1153","DALEK"," You and your companions need a drug to stay alive. "
"1155","DALEK"," Tardis? He is becoming delirious. I do not understand his words. "
"1157","DALEK"," Stay in the light. "
"1159","DALEK"," We cannot move outside the city. "
"1161","DALEK"," Providing whoever you send understands the rest of you will be held responsible for his return. "
"1163","DALEK"," Then we agree. "
"1165","DALEK"," Over five hundred years ago there were two races on this planet. We, the Daleks, and the Thals. After the neutronic war, our Dalek forefathers retired into the city, protected my our machines. "
"1167","DALEK"," Most of them perished in the war, but we know that there are survivors. They must be disgustingly mutated, but the fact that they have survived tells us they must have a drug that preserves the life force. "
"1169","DALEK"," As you say yourself, all your lives depend on it. "
"1211","DALEK"," You must leave now. "
"1213","DALEK"," You must leave now. "
"1215","DALEK"," Which one of you is going? "
"1218","DALEK"," There are others. "
"1227","DALEK"," Are you ready? "
"1232","DALEK"," The child has set out. "
"1233","DALEK"," Her direction is being followed on the rangescopes? "
"1234","DALEK"," Yes. "
"1235","DALEK"," Mark her movements carefully. If there are more Thal people living in the jungle, she will try to contact them. "
"1236","DALEK"," I understand. If she returns with the drugs, am I to allow the prisoners to use it? "
"1237","DALEK"," No. They will die in time. There only value is in bringing us enough of the Thal drug to duplicate it for our own use. "
"1263","DALEK"," I have just come from the prisoners. The old man is dying. "
"1264","DALEK"," Then he must die. There is no help we can give him. How are the others? "
"1265","DALEK"," The woman is sleeping very heavily. The young man fights against it. "
"1266","DALEK"," What of the girl? Has she reached the jungle? "
"1267","DALEK"," Yes, the rangerscopes tracked her that far. Now they have lost her. "
"1300","DALEK"," I have returned the girl to the cell. "
"1301","DALEK"," Very well. "
"1302","DALEK"," They are asking for water. "
"1303","DALEK"," Give them some. It is clear that the girl must have made contact with the Thals. "
"1304","DALEK"," Our prisoners could bring the Thals to us.Â "
"1305","DALEK"," Precisely that. "
"1327","DALEK"," We could let this catastrophe destroy the Thals. "
"1328","DALEK"," Will they let themselves starve to death? No. I feel preserving our prisoners was a good idea. "
"1329","DALEK"," And an arrangement to bring the Thals inside our city an even better one. "
"1330","DALEK"," We'll let our prisoners sleep and then give them food. After that, we can plan. "
"1331","DALEK"," Why not begin now? "
"1332","DALEK"," Because the lapse of time, the relaxation of sleep, the provision of food, all these things will give them a false sense of security. "
"1333","DALEK"," We have brought you food and more water.   The girl is to come with me. "
"1337","DALEK"," She will be returned. We are going to help the Thals, which is what you want us to do. Come now. "
"1384","DALEK"," Have liquid foods, water in abundance. We can also supply unlimited quantities of fresh vegetables which are forced in artificial sunlight. "
"1386","DALEK"," In return, we shall expect the Thals to help us in the re-cultivation of the land surrounding the "
"1387","DALEK"," Why have you stopped writing? "
"1389","DALEK"," Then put down that we expect them to help us. "
"1391","DALEK"," Please sit still while we examine what you've written.   What is the last word here? "
"1393","DALEK"," Su San. Stop that noise.   "
"1395","DALEK"," Have you told the Thals that you would write this name on the message? "
"1397","DALEK"," No. "
"1399","DALEK"," We have planned otherwise. "
"1404","DALEK"," It does not matter. We have the message now. "
"1423","DALEK"," Do you think it was broken accidentally in their struggle? "
"1424","DALEK"," No, the cable is strong. They have broken it deliberately. "
"1425","DALEK"," They can be moved immediately to another room, the eye repaired. "
"1426","DALEK"," No. "
"1427","DALEK"," Extermination, then. "
"1428","DALEK"," There is no escape from the room that holds them. They may well be useful again. We shall deal with the Thals. "
"1480","DALEK"," Move back from the door.   Take the food. "
"1502","DALEK"," Take this. "
"1504","DALEK"," Keep away. Keep away from me.   Keep away from me! Keep away! Keep away! "
"1506","DALEK"," Keep away from me! Keep away from me! Keep away from me! Keep away from me! Keep away from me! "
"1553","DALEK"," Stop. "
"1555","DALEK"," I have not been informed. Wait. "
"1557","DALEK"," Hold her. "
"1559","DALEK"," Shall I help you to the fourth level with them? "
"1568","DALEK"," I have just passed the prisoners through into lift shaft seven. "
"1569","DALEK"," There are no orders to move the prisoners. Hold them. "
"1570","DALEK"," The door is locked. Emergency alarm. "
"1571","DALEK"," Attention. Immobilise lift shaft seven floor area. "
"1608","DALEK"," It is nearly completed. "
"1609","DALEK"," It is empty. "
"1610","DALEK"," Lock the lift. "
"1611","DALEK"," The emergency switch. Bring it down. "
"1630","DALEK"," Make no attempt to capture them. They are to be exterminated. You understand? Exterminated. "
"1631","DALEK"," I understand. "
"1660","DALEK"," They are approaching. "
"1682","DALEK"," Fire! "
"1779","DALEK"," The drug has been duplicated. "
"1780","DALEK"," And the distribution? "
"1781","DALEK"," The drug is to be taken by sections of us so work will not be interrupted. "
"1782","DALEK"," Have you processed the pictures? "
"1783","DALEK"," Appearing now on frequency 6.   It is the elder prisoner. "
"1784","DALEK"," Show second picture. "
"1785","DALEK"," The girl and the young woman. Is that the body of the fourth prisoner? The young man? "
"1786","DALEK"," If so, he has been injured. "
"1787","DALEK"," Show third picture.   They have made contact with the Thals. "
"1788","DALEK"," It is logical that together they will attack us. "
"1862","DALEK"," Help. Cannot control. Cannot control. Help me. Help me. Help! Help! Help! Help! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! "
"1863","DALEK"," Emergency. Emergency. All Daleks in section three are incapable of working. "
"1864","DALEK"," Section three? That was the first section to get the anti-radiation drug received from the Thals. "
"1865","DALEK"," Stand by for a general announcement. This is control. All distribution of the anti-radiation drug is to be stopped immediately. The Dalek race has become conditioned to radiation. "
"1866","DALEK"," But if you are right, we are in danger. "
"1867","DALEK"," All Daleks in section three are dying. "
"1868","DALEK"," They must be examined immediately. "
"1869","DALEK"," Look, the disease has reached us in here. "
"1870","DALEK"," Then we cannot delay. "
"1871","DALEK"," But what are we to do? Is this the end of the Daleks? "
"1872","DALEK"," We need radiation to survive. So we must increase our supply of radiation. "
"1873","DALEK"," But there is only one way to do that. "
"1874","DALEK"," Exactly. We may have to explode another neutron bomb. "
"1891","DALEK"," Has the anti-radiation drug distribution been stopped? "
"1892","DALEK"," Yes. Only Daleks in section two and three received it. All Daleks in section three have now died. "
"1893","DALEK"," Daleks in section two are to be brought to the sonic chamber. "
"1894","DALEK"," We will direct the air polluted by radiation away from the nuclear reactors into the sonic chamber. "
"1895","DALEK"," And if they do not die, we shall have our answer. "
"1896","DALEK"," But if we need radiation, we can never rebuild the world outside. "
"1897","DALEK"," We do not have to adapt to the environment. We will change the environment to suit us. "
"1922","DALEK"," The laser scope is transmitting. The quality is poor. What has happened? Has this group broken away? Is there a plan behind it? Why divide their forces? "
"1923","DALEK"," The figures are coming through on the radiation treatment. "
"1924","DALEK"," Discontinue laser scope. "
"1925","DALEK"," There is an improvement. Except for one serious case, all Daleks in section two have shown signs of recovery. "
"1926","DALEK"," Then our position is clear. For us, the drug is a poison. "
"1927","DALEK"," And radiation is still necessary to us. "
"1928","DALEK"," Essential. I want a complete survey of our stock of nuclear materials. I want an estimate of the amount of waste matter from the nuclear reactors. "
"2016","DALEK"," The report for the neutron bomb is prepared. "
"2017","DALEK"," Let us hear it. "
"2018","DALEK"," Report on neutron bomb to cover five hundred square miles. Time to construct, twenty three days. "
"2019","DALEK"," Is that the shortest possible time? "
"2020","DALEK"," Yes. "
"2021","DALEK"," Very well. It is too long. "
"2022","DALEK"," We must abandon the idea of a neutron bomb. "
"2023","DALEK"," We must find another way of spreading radiation. "
"2071","DALEK"," Rangerscopes are recording great activity amongst the Thal people. "
"2072","DALEK"," Are there pictures? "
"2073","DALEK"," No, reception is bad. "
"2074","DALEK"," They are attacking our instruments. "
"2075","DALEK"," We must keep alert. "
"2076","DALEK"," Yes. Concentrate all power of rangerscopes and vibrascopes on all entrances to the city. "
"2116","DALEK"," Emergency. Emergency. Reaction on the vibrascopes. "
"2117","DALEK"," Where? "
"2118","DALEK"," Section fifteen, city wall. "
"2119","DALEK"," Shall I redirect the rangerscopes? "
"2120","DALEK"," No. If we track them by their vibrations, we can take them by surprise. "
"2178","DALEK"," You have destroyed our videoscope and one of our lifts. "
"2180","DALEK"," The only interest we have in the Thals is their total extermination. "
"2182","DALEK"," Tomorrow the atmosphere will be bombarded by the radiation from our nuclear reactors. "
"2185","DALEK"," No, extermination. "
"2187","DALEK"," Without radiation, the Dalek race is ended. We need it as you and the Thals need air. "
"2220","DALEK"," What we need for life means death for the Thals. "
"2222","DALEK"," Only one race can survive. "
"2224","DALEK"," We wish to escape captivity. Go out and rebuild the planet Skaro. Our oxygen distributors will be subjected to waste radiation by the ejector capsule. "
"2226","DALEK"," Except the Daleks. "
"2228","DALEK"," Now. "
"2254","DALEK"," Power down to half. "
"2255","DALEK"," Down to half. "
"2256","DALEK"," Seal off nuclear waste disposer. "
"2257","DALEK"," Sealing complete. "
"2258","DALEK"," Begin radiation redirection to distribution capsule. "
"2261","DALEK"," It does not matter now. "
"2263","DALEK"," A ship? What do you mean? "
"2265","DALEK"," I do not believe you. "
"2268","DALEK"," You are not capable of creating such a machine. "
"2270","DALEK"," What did it look like? "
"2272","DALEK"," Yes, I have it here. "
"2274","DALEK"," A bargain for your lives? "
"2276","DALEK"," Where is this machine? "
"2278","DALEK"," Good. When the neutron operation has been completed, we will find a way to travel outside the city limits. "
"2280","DALEK"," We will examine your machine. "
"2282","DALEK"," Now we know of the machine, we can examine it for ourselves. "
"2284","DALEK"," Every problem has a solution. "
"2285","DALEK"," Vibration locator records movement inside the city wall. "
"2286","DALEK"," Details. "
"2287","DALEK"," Disturbance is too great. "
"2288","DALEK"," Alert Daleks in Section one. The Thals are entering the city. "
"2294","DALEK"," Alert. The Thals are entering the city. All Daleks in section one to level one. Immediate. Immediate. "
"2296","DALEK"," Interior videoscopes are recording movement on level eight. "
"2298","DALEK"," All Daleks on level eight. Urgent.   The Thals have penetrated to level eight. Immediate action. Immediate action. "
"2299","DALEK"," How did they get into the city? "
"2300","DALEK"," Capsule ready to go critical. "
"2301","DALEK"," Stand by. "
"2302","DALEK"," Standing by, ready. "
"2303","DALEK"," The last stage of the operation is about to begin. "
"2305","DALEK"," Nothing can stop the Daleks. Begin countdown. One hundred. "
"2306","DALEK"," Beginning now. "
"2318","DALEK"," Daleks go to control room immediately. All Daleks to level ten. "
"2322","DALEK"," All Daleks to level ten immediately. Corridor intersections on all levels other than ten will be sealed now. "
"2328","DALEK"," Fifty two. "
"2329","DALEK"," The Thals are blocking the intersections from sealing on level nine. "
"2330","DALEK"," Fifty one. "
"2331","DALEK"," Increase power. Emergency. Increase power. "
"2332","DALEK"," Forty nine. Forty eight. "
"2340","DALEK"," Forty six. Forty five. Forty four. Forty three. Forty two. "
"2342","DALEK"," Forty. Thirty nine. Thirty eight. Thirty seven. Thirty six. Thirty five. Thirty four. Thirty three.   Thirty two. Thirty one. Thirty. Twenty nine. Twenty eight. Twenty seven. Twenty six. Twenty five. Twenty four. Twenty three. Twenty two. Twenty one. Twenty.   Nineteen. Eighteen. Seventeen.   Sixteen. Fifteen. Fourteen.   Thirteen. "
"2343","DALEK"," Follow and kill her. "
"2344","DALEK"," Twelve. Eleven. Ten. "
"2345","DALEK"," Trapped. Help me. Trapped. "
"2346","DALEK"," Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. "
"2347","DALEK"," Reinforcements. Overpowered. Reinforcements. Quickly. Quickly."
"2350","DALEK"," Power going. "
"2355","DALEK"," Listen to me. "
"2357","DALEK","   Stop our power from wasting or it will be the end of the Daleks. "
"10833","DALEK"," Why have the human beings been allowed to get so near the river? "
"10836","DALEK"," Where is the Robo-control for this section? "
"10838","DALEK"," You will take his place until he is found. The human beings are to be taken to landing area one. "
"10841","DALEK"," We do not release prisoners. We are the masters of the Earth. "
"10843","DALEK"," Obey us or die. "
"10845","DALEK"," Stop. I can hear you. I have heard many similar words from leaders of your different races. All of them were destroyed. I warn you, resistance is useless. "
"10847","DALEK"," We have already conquered Earth. "
"10849","DALEK"," Take them. Take them.   We are the masters of Earth. We are the masters of Earth. We are the masters of Earth. "
"10850","DALEK"," Survivors of London, the Daleks are the masters of Earth. Surrender now and you will live. Those wishing to surrender must stand in the middle of the street, and obey orders received. Message ends. "
"10900","DALEK"," Where are the other two from your patrol? "
"10902","DALEK"," For this you will be punished. Continue your patrol. The prisoners will fall in line. "
"10907","DALEK"," The prisoners will remain silent. "
"10911","BLACKDALEK"," Kill him.   Any further resistance will be dealt with in the same way. "
"10912","DALEK"," The prisoners will proceed into the ship. "
"10946","DALEK"," Halt. You will move one by one slowly into the prison cell. "
"10948","DALEK"," You. Reverse and move. "
"10949","BLACKDALEK"," Is that the one? "
"10950","DALEK"," Yes. He spoke of resistance. "
"10951","BLACKDALEK"," His words betray greater intelligence than normal in human beings. "
"10952","DALEK"," Give them the test. "
"10984","DALEK"," All radio waves bands are open. "
"10985","BLACKDALEK"," Rebels of London, this is our last offer. Our final warning. Leave your hiding places. Show yourselves in the open streets. You will be fed and watered. Work is needed from you but the Daleks offer you life. "
"10986","BLACKDALEK"," Rebel against us and the Daleks will destroy London completely. You will all die, the males, the females and descendants. Rebels of London, come out of your hiding places. The Daleks offer you life. "
"11048","DALEK"," You have passed the escape test we set you. Take him. "
"11050","DALEK"," He will be robotised. "
"11054","DALEK"," Our prisoner will move to the table. "
"11055","DALEK"," Take off his coat.   Anaesthetize him. "
"11058","DALEK"," Take the prisoners into the ship. Wait. In which sector were these prisoners taken? "
"11060","DALEK"," No patrol has been ordered in sector four. "
"11062","DALEK"," Warning! "
"11063","DALEK"," Attack! "
"11064","DALEK"," Warning! "
"11065","DALEK"," Attack! "
"11066","DALEK"," Get the prisoners inside. "
"11068","DALEK"," Section five move forward. Seal off the area. "
"11070","DALEK"," We are under attack. Report to main ramp. General alert. Report to main ramp. "
"11071","BLACKDALEK"," Disregard. Commence the operation.   "
"11075","DALEK"," All Robomen reserve into action. Destroy invaders. "
"11092","DALEK"," They are retreating. Take prisoners where possible. Do not kill."
"11093","DALEK"," All exits to the square are blocked. "
"11095","BLACKDALEK"," Has the attack been defeated? "
"11096","DALEK"," Yes. Most of the rebels were killed or wounded. "
"11097","BLACKDALEK"," Find every survivor. Destroy every one. Destroy them! Destroy every one of them! Destroy! "
"11139","BLACKDALEK"," Supreme Command have given orders for London to be destroyed by firebombs. "
"11140","DALEK"," Do you intend to stay here in the city? "
"11141","BLACKDALEK"," No. Order the saucer to take me to the mine workings in central England. "
"11142","DALEK"," Five, four, three, two, one. Lift off. "
"11157","DALEK"," Break on seventy two. Break on seventy two. Report zero five five Roboman. Fault. "
"11162","DALEK"," Stop! Stop! Stop! "
"11164","DALEK"," Stop! "
"11166","DALEK"," Stop! "
"11209","DALEK"," Fire. "
"11253","DALEK"," Who are you? Subcultural. "
"11284","BLACKDALEK"," Lower ramp and disembark. "
"11337","DALEK"," Report Beta section zero zero one. Parade for robotisation selection at hut thirty. End. "
"11398","DALEK"," Rebels travelling in motorised vehicle have attacked and passed Dalek outer London cordon. "
"11399","DALEK"," This is saucer Alpha Major. Am forty five miles south of mining area. "
"11400","DALEK"," Intercept rebels and destroy."
"11401","DALEK"," Position of rebel vehicle? Give position. "
"11402","DALEK"," South east eight over three seven six. North, north, nine point eight. "
"11514","BLACKDALEK"," There is no work party in shaft nine. Why? "
"11515","DALEK"," The section is completed. The labour force is being assembled for clearing operations. "
"11516","BLACKDALEK"," Work must proceed to schedule. There must be no delays. "
"11517","DALEK"," All will be ready. The waste bucket in shaft nine is being lowered now. "
"11583","DALEK"," You will follow me, both of you. Do not try to escape or you will be exterminated. Move. "
"11612","DALEK","   Emergency! Emergency! Priority shaft nine. Close all exits! Emergency! "
"11664","DALEK"," You. Take all buckets to the clearing section. "
"11678","DALEK"," Get back to work. "
"11680","DALEK"," There will be no revolution. The Daleks are masters of Earth. "
"11682","DALEK"," You are lying. It is a trick. "
"11684","DALEK"," Proof? Let me see.   Details of the acid bomb used in the unprovoked attack on the London saucer landing area. "
"11686","DALEK"," Very well. Speak. "
"11688","DALEK"," That is impossible. Tell me your story. "
"11690","DALEK"," The Black Dalek will see you, but if you are lying, you will be killed. Follow me. "
"11696","BLACKDALEK"," Give me your report. "
"11697","DALEK"," The main drills have penetrated the quartz strata. We are within four miles of the Earth's outer core. "
"11698","BLACKDALEK"," When will the final breakthrough occur? "
"11699","DALEK"," The slave parties are clearing the top of the fissure now. "
"11700","BLACKDALEK"," What remains to be done? "
"11701","DALEK"," Only to put into position the penetration explosive. The charge is in the fissure capsule now. When positioned, the charge will strike the fissure in the Earth's crust here. "
"11702","BLACKDALEK"," The fissure will expand, the molten core be released. "
"11703","DALEK"," We will then control the flow until all the gravitational and magnetic forces in the Earth's core are eliminated. "
"11704","BLACKDALEK"," Excellent. I will now announce to the Dalek Earth force, completion of Project Degravitate in two hours time. "
"11705","DALEK"," Attention."
"11706","DALEK"," Attention all units. Stand by for an announcement by the Supreme Controller."
"11707","BLACKDALEK"," This is the Supreme Controller. Our mission to Earth is nearly completed. We were sent here to remove the core of this planet."
"11708","BLACKDALEK"," Once the core is removed, we can replace it with a power system that will enable us to pilot the planet anywhere in the universe."
"11709","BLACKDALEK"," All that remains is to put into position the penetration explosive. Daleks controlling device will now report. "
"11710","DALEK"," We are ready. "
"11711","BLACKDALEK"," Arm the device. "
"11712","DALEK"," Device now armed. "
"11713","BLACKDALEK"," Set capsule in motion. "
"11714","DALEK"," Hatch over control to closed position. Motor running. "
"11715","DALEK"," Capsule moving."
"11716","BLACKDALEK"," As soon as the capsule is in position over the fissure, release it.   "
"11718","DALEK"," Capsule now arrived at sub station. "
"11719","BLACKDALEK"," Ascertain extent of breakdown and then "
"11720","DALEK"," Man has been seen leaving capsule. "
"11721","BLACKDALEK"," Exterminate him! Exterminate him! Exterminate him!"
"11722","DALEK"," Stay where you are! "
"11724","DALEK"," Move. "
"11726","DALEK"," Silence. You will only speak when you are ordered to do so."
"11727","DALEK"," Dalek reports human fallen down bomb shaft. Capsule is being repaired. "
"11728","DALEK"," Wait here."
"11729","BLACKDALEK"," Every error must be corrected. The penetration explosive must strike the fissure correctly if we are to extract the molten core. Have all work tasks been completed? "
"11730","DALEK"," They have. "
"11731","BLACKDALEK"," Then arrange for the extermination of all human beings. "
"11732","DALEK"," Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill! "
"11733","DALEK"," The final solution! Clear up this planet! "
"11734","BLACKDALEK"," Alter the command frequencies to aural control to all Robomen. They are to herd humans down to the lower galleries. "
"11735","DALEK"," Immediately. Testing aural control. Testing aural control."
"11736","DALEK"," Testing aural control. Testing aural control."
"11738","DALEK"," Herd all humans to galleries to nine, ten and fifteen. "
"11742","DALEK"," They are the prisoners that reported the imminent revolt. "
"11743","BLACKDALEK"," Speak! "
"11745","BLACKDALEK"," We are not interested in the bomb. Give your information! "
"11747","BLACKDALEK"," Indian mutiny? We are the masters of India! "
"11749","BLACKDALEK"," Wait! Why have I not been informed of this? "
"11750","DALEK"," There has been no information. "
"11752","BLACKDALEK"," Attention! Attention! Mobilise defence forces! "
"11754","BLACKDALEK"," Take them! They are lying! Take them! Take them! Take them! "
"11755","DALEK"," I will arrange for their extermination. "
"11756","BLACKDALEK"," No. Secure them. They will be killed in the explosion. The countdown must proceed to schedule. "
"11776","BLACKDALEK"," As soon as the repairs to the capsule are complete, the explosive device will be released into the bowels of this planet. "
"11778","BLACKDALEK"," Attention all Daleks. Our saucers are hovering above the mine area. Notice to board saucers will be given shortly."
"11782","DALEK"," The work on the capsule is complete. The device is ready. "
"11783","BLACKDALEK"," Good. We shall have one hour to leave when the device is fired. Am firing now.   The explosive device is on its way to the centre of the Earth. We shall go the edge of the mine workings and be picked up by the saucers."
"11804","DALEK"," Scanner frequencies have been changed in Central control. "
"11805","BLACKDALEK"," The prisoners must have escaped! Deal with them. "
"11809","DALEK"," Two zero reporting."
"11811","DALEK"," Will exterminate them at zero range."
"11813","DALEK"," Thermostat reading too high! Heat increase intolerable! Heat increase complete! Power loss complete! Argh! "
"15857","DALEK"," Our greatest enemies have left the planet Xeros. They are once again in time and space. "
"15858","DALEK"," They cannot escape! Our time machine will soon follow them. They will be exterminated! Exterminated! Exterminated!  "
"15859","DALEK"," Our greatest enemies have left the planet Xeros. They are once again in time and space. "
"15860","DALEK"," They cannot escape! Our time machine will soon follow them. They will be exterminated! Exterminated! Exterminated!"
"16020","DALEK"," The Supreme Dalek is ready to receive your report!   The report is ready. "
"16023","BLACKDALEK"," Give your report. "
"16024","DALEK"," Our time machine has been completed. "
"16025","BLACKDALEK"," The operation will proceed at once. The movement scanners have located the enemy time machine, Tardis. "
"16026","DALEK"," Tardis! Tardis! Tardis! Tardis! Tardis! "
"16029","BLACKDALEK"," At present it lies in the Segaro desert of the planet Aridius. "
"16030","DALEK"," We await command. "
"16031","BLACKDALEK"," The Doctor and the three humans delayed our conquest of Earth. "
"16032","DALEK"," Daleks cannot be defeated! "
"16033","DALEK"," To defy Daleks is death! "
"16034","DALEK"," They will pay for their crime! "
"16035","BLACKDALEK"," Annihilate! "
"16036","DALEK"," Annihilate! Annihilate! Annihilate! Annihilate! Annihilate! "
"16037","BLACKDALEK"," The assassination group will embark at once in our time machine. They pursue the humans through all eternity. They must be destroyed! Exterminate them! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! "
"16089","DALEK"," The enemy time machine is in this area. "
"16090","DALEK"," We can locate the position with our seismic detectors. "
"16091","DALEK"," Find and destroy it. The remainder will search for the humans."
"16092","DALEK"," Are they to be taken alive? "
"16093","DALEK"," No. They are to be exterminated. "
"16094","DALEK"," Good. "
"16095","DALEK"," Destroyed. "
"16096","DALEK"," Exterminated. "
"16097","DALEK"," Now, let the search begin. "
"16103","DALEK"," Wait. Tracks of the humans. "
"16104","DALEK"," Follow them. "
"16105","DALEK"," Wait. Perceptor indicates someone is near. It draws closer. "
"16106","DALEK"," Destroy on sight. "
"16107","DALEK"," An Aridian. One of the species that inhabits this planet. Unimportant. Continue the search. "
"16151","DALEK"," The seismic detector is registering a contact. "
"16152","DALEK"," The enemy time machine is beneath the sand at this point. "
"16153","DALEK"," Then it was buried by last night's storm. "
"16154","DALEK"," It must be uncovered before we can destroy it. "
"16155","DALEK"," Yes. "
"16156","DALEK"," We will take some Aridians prisoner. "
"16157","DALEK"," Yes. "
"16158","DALEK"," And use them to dig the ship free. "
"16159","DALEK"," Yes. "
"16160","DALEK"," Well, see to it! "
"16161","DALEK"," I obey!"
"16184","DALEK"," The digging is completed. Are the prisoners to go free? "
"16185","DALEK"," No. They are worthless inferior creatures. "
"16186","DALEK"," They have no value to us. Destroy them. "
"16187","DALEK"," Destroy the enemy time machine. Use full power. Fire! Again. Fire! It is undamaged. "
"16188","DALEK"," It must be constructed of a material that can resist our neutralisers. "
"16189","DALEK"," Failure. "
"16190","DALEK"," Remain on guard until the prisoners have been handed over and exterminated. "
"16191","DALEK"," We obey."
"16228","DALEK"," The prisoners have escaped from the Aridians. "
"16229","DALEK"," Are we to proceed with the destruction of the underground city? "
"16230","DALEK"," The Aridians have one hour to re-capture the humans. If they fail, we act. "
"16231","DALEK"," I understand. "
"16232","DALEK"," The humans may try to reach their machine. "
"16233","DALEK"," Remain on guard. "
"16234","DALEK"," I obey."
"16287","DALEK"," Cease firing. They have escaped. "
"16288","DALEK"," Final termination is inevitable. "
"16289","DALEK"," Eradicate! "
"16290","DALEK"," Obliterate! "
"16291","DALEK"," Annihilate! "
"16292","DALEK"," We will embark in our time machine at once. The Dalek Supreme has ordered they are to be pursued through all eternity. Pursued and exterminated!   "
"16312","DALEK"," Enemy time machine position now constant."
"16313","DALEK"," Lock tracking device. "
"16314","DALEK"," Tracking device locked. "
"16315","DALEK"," Report extent of time curve. "
"16316","DALEK"," Seven seven three Dalekian scale, nine one five degrees. "
"16317","DALEK"," Compute time lag by earth scale. "
"16318","DALEK"," Er, one, er, forty, er. Computer reading one five earth minutes, reducing. "
"16319","DALEK"," We are close behind them. "
"16320","DALEK"," Success! Success! "
"16321","DALEK"," Exterminate! "
"16322","DALEK"," Success! "
"16323","DALEK"," Final victory inevitable! "
"16324","DALEK"," Order executioner to prepare to disembark. "
"16325","DALEK"," I obey."
"16383","DALEK"," Movie pe? Where are they? "
"16462","DALEK"," We shall soon be arriving. Order the search party to stand by. "
"16463","DALEK"," They are ready. "
"16464","DALEK"," Is that where the humans have landed? "
"16465","DALEK"," Yes. Join the search party and prepare to disembark. We are materialising now."
"16469","DALEK"," Where are the time travellers? "
"16472","DALEK"," Wait. "
"16474","DALEK"," Do not move. Answer my question. "
"16477","DALEK"," Is the earth time machine here? "
"16478","DALEK"," It has not yet been discovered. "
"16479","DALEK"," Join in the search. "
"16480","DALEK"," You search up there. "
"16482","DALEK"," Wait! "
"16484","DALEK"," There is no one on the vessel. "
"16485","DALEK"," Come. We must continue our pursuit course. "
"16558","DALEK"," The enemy time machine is here. We have caught them. "
"16559","DALEK"," Which planet are we on. "
"16560","DALEK"," Earth. They only changed their geographical and time location."
"16561","DALEK"," This time they will not elude us. Already the search force is disembarking."
"16562","DALEK"," Search. I shall remain here in case they return."
"16570","DALEK"," Where are the time travellers? "
"16572","DALEK"," Do not move. "
"16574","DALEK"," Do not move. I am a Dalek.   We are invincible.   Stop! Stop! Ahh! "
"16583","DALEK"," Halt! You will be exterminated. "
"16588","DALEK"," Eradicate her.   Obliterate. "
"16590","DALEK"," Embark at once. "
"16591","DALEK"," At once! "
"16592","DALEK"," Yes! Embark! "
"16593","DALEK"," Embark! At once! "
"16594","DALEK"," Embark! Embark! Embark! Embark! "
"16613","DALEK"," We are locked in pursuit course. "
"16614","DALEK"," Calculate destination of enemy time machine. "
"16615","DALEK"," Report. "
"16616","DALEK"," The enemy is approaching the planet Mechanus. "
"16617","DALEK"," Contact Skaro. Report our destination to the Dalek Supreme. "
"16618","DALEK"," I obey. "
"16619","DALEK"," Is the reproducer repaired? "
"16620","DALEK"," We await your orders. "
"16621","DALEK"," Manufacture will commence at once."
"16622","DALEK"," Which of the four humans is to be reproduced? "
"16623","DALEK"," Their leader, the one they call Doctor. Is the reproducer programmed? "
"16624","DALEK"," All is in readiness. Photo images and relevant data are in the computer. The humanoid will be completed by the time we arrive at our destination. "
"16625","DALEK"," Excellent. Commence operations, then assemble at cell renovator chamber. "
"16626","DALEK"," We obey! "
"16627","DALEK"," Of course. "
"16647","DALEK"," Report position of enemy machine. "
"16648","DALEK"," It's movement through time is ending. "
"16649","DALEK"," It is approaching the planet Mechanus. "
"16650","DALEK"," How long before we reach them? "
"16651","DALEK"," Er, er, in earth time, er, four minutes. "
"16652","DALEK"," There is much to do."
"16653","DALEK"," Is the humanoid robot complete? "
"16654","DALEK"," The computer is feeding its memory cells with data. "
"16655","DALEK"," Physical characteristics are completed. Energy cells fully charged. "
"16656","DALEK"," Micro-units containing personality and vocal mannerisms are charged. "
"16657","DALEK"," Prepare to activate. Activate the robot. "
"16666","DALEK"," Success! Paramount success! It is impossible to distinguish from the original. "
"16667","DALEK"," We have landed on the planet Mechanus. "
"16668","DALEK"," Operate ramp control. Activate robot power source.   Your orders are understood? You will infiltrate and kill. "
"16669","DALEK"," Infiltrate and kill! "
"16688","DALEK"," This is the planet Mechanus. All forms of life are to be treated as hostile. "
"16689","DALEK"," Understood. Pass the order. All forms of life to be destroyed on contact. "
"16690","DALEK"," I obey. "
"16691","DALEK"," Is the humanoid robot standing by? "
"16692","DALEK"," It awaits your orders. "
"16693","DALEK"," Our enemies are moving through the jungle. You are to join them. "
"16695","DALEK"," We shall follow it as escort. Advise all units. "
"16729","DALEK"," The light source has vanished. "
"16730","DALEK"," Patrols will continue to advance eastward. Perceptors register much movement in that area. "
"16731","DALEK"," Alert! Alert! Alert! "
"16732","DALEK"," The patrol will continue. "
"16733","DALEK"," Have I sustained damage. "
"16734","DALEK"," No. The patrol will continue. "
"16795","DALEK"," The enemy time machine. With this in our control, they cannot escape. What is that noise? "
"16796","DALEK"," Hostile plant life! Destroy! Destroy! "
"16797","DALEK"," You destroy! "
"16798","DALEK"," There is no trace of the humans. "
"16799","DALEK"," Or the robot? "
"16800","DALEK"," No. Contact has been lost. "
"16801","DALEK"," We will organise a full scale search of the jungle at daybreak."
"16838","DALEK"," They are trapped in the rock face. "
"16839","DALEK"," Attack formation! Attack formation! Attack formation! Attack formation! Attack! "
"16840","DALEK"," Section four will enter the cave. Do not deviate. "
"16841","DALEK"," We obey. "
"16842","DALEK"," Section two will circle the cave. Take a position amongst the boulders and cut off any attempt to escape. "
"16843","DALEK"," We obey. "
"16844","DALEK"," We will take no prisoners. Eliminate on sight. "
"16845","DALEK"," We obey. "
"16846","DALEK"," Move to position. On my command, advance and attack. "
"16847","DALEK"," Align and advance! "
"16848","DALEK"," Advance and attack! "
"16849","DALEK"," Attack and destroy! Destroy and rejoice!"
"16850","DALEK"," Halt! You will be exterminated! "
"16852","DALEK"," You lie. You are not the robot. "
"16857","DALEK"," Advance. Advance and attack! Attack and destroy! Destroy and rejoice! "
"16859","DALEK"," Attack! Attack! Destroy!  "
"16866","DALEK"," They have escaped. "
"16867","DALEK"," Not possible. Perceptor readings indicated they were here. "
"16868","DALEK"," Subject walls to seismic detector tests.   It is required that we penetrate this wall. Section four will return to the time craft for the electrode unit. "
"16869","DALEK"," We obey."
"16930","DALEK"," Electrode unit ready. "
"16931","DALEK"," Operate. Increase power. Conveyor descending. "
"16932","DALEK"," By taking the humans, the Mechons have forced us to take action against them. We invade. "
"16933","DALEK"," Skaro reports they have many powerful weapons. We may sustain damage. "
"16934","DALEK"," The orders of the Dalek Supreme will be obeyed! The humans will be destroyed! The Mechons will not be permitted to stand in our way! We attack! We attack! "
"16935","DALEK"," Attack! Attack! Attack! Attack! Attack! Attack! Attack! "
"16982","DALEK"," Where are the space travellers? "
"16989","DALEK"," You will be annihilated! "
"16990","DALEK"," Dispatch a section to the roof area. "
"16991","DALEK"," I obey. "
"16992","DALEK"," Am exterminated! Am exterminated! Argh! "
"16993","DALEK"," Totally immobilised. "
"17033","DALEK"," To defy Daleks is death! "
"17034","DALEK"," We await commands! "
"17035","DALEK"," The operation will proceed at once. "
"17037","DALEK"," They must be destroyed. "
"17039","DALEK"," Exterminate them! Exterminate! "
"17041","DALEK"," Annihilate! "
"20704","DALEK"," One man remains. Find and destroy him! "
"20705","DALEK"," I obey! "
"20748","DALEK"," Control reports space vessel 1-11 in landing circuit. "
"20749","BLACKDALEK"," Is all prepared? "
"20750","DALEK"," Everything is ready. "
"20761","DALEK"," Space vessel 1-11 touch down completed. "
"20762","BLACKDALEK"," Excellent. I will await our guest here. "
"20779","DALEK"," Our new ally approaches! "
"20780","BLACKDALEK"," We welcome you as we welcome all allies of the Daleks. "
"20783","DALEK"," Inform base security that a further intruder craft has been located. "
"20784","DALEK"," I obey. "
"20785","DALEK"," Security patrols five and seven will converge on this area. Priority alert. Invaders to be located and destroyed.   A message from the Dalek Supreme. Operation Inferno to be put into execution at once. "
"20786","DALEK"," Inform all units. Evacuate patrols to safety areas. Confirm with units in position. On confirmation, start abbreviated countdown for Operation Inferno."
"20805","BLACKDALEK"," Report. "
"20806","DALEK"," Guardian of the Solar System Chen must be watched. His ambitions exceed his usefulness. "
"20807","BLACKDALEK"," When he has served his purpose, he, like the others, will be eliminated. No power in this universe can stop the Daleks."
"20832","DALEK"," Operate pyro-flames! "
"20833","DALEK"," We obey! "
"20885","DALEK"," Zephon. "
"20886","BLACKDALEK"," It was expected. His usefulness is over."
"20903","BLACKDALEK"," Where is the Master of Zephon? "
"20905","BLACKDALEK"," Search for him!"
"20927","DALEK"," Has the representative Zephon passed this way? "
"20928","DALEK"," He and the Earth creature went to the reception area. "
"20929","DALEK"," Has he returned? "
"20930","DALEK"," Only the creature from Earth returned this way. "
"20931","DALEK"," Zephon must still be there. Come with me. He has to be found. "
"20932","DALEK"," Representative Zephon? The meeting is about to begin. You will follow me. "
"20937","BLACKDALEK"," Take your place. "
"20939","BLACKDALEK"," This seventh meeting is now in session. Representatives, I have important news. The time destructor is now completed. It only requires the core to be fitted.   Mavic Chen, Guardian of the Solar System, will address the meeting. "
"20949","DALEK"," Locate intruders! Locate intruders! "
"20951","DALEK"," Seal off the area. "
"20952","DALEK"," Check alarm location. "
"20953","DALEK"," Report! Alarm! Report! "
"20970","DALEK"," Altitude 5 sections. Speed 3000. "
"20971","DALEK"," Vessel attained gravitational escape velocity. "
"20972","BLACKDALEK"," Cut in automatic trackers. "
"20973","DALEK"," All is ready for their space extinction. "
"20974","BLACKDALEK"," Do not destroy! That vessel must not be destroyed. "
"20975","DALEK"," Trackers operating. "
"20976","BLACKDALEK"," Prepare Neutronic Randomiser. "
"20977","DALEK"," Stand by Randomiser. "
"20978","BLACKDALEK"," The intruders must be caught alive. "
"21008","BLACKDALEK"," Representative Zephon! You deny that your negligence caused the loss of the taranium core? "
"21018","BLACKDALEK"," Have you nothing to say? "
"21023","BLACKDALEK"," You knew about the intruders. "
"21025","BLACKDALEK"," Silence! It is agreed that you are guilty of negligence. "
"21027","BLACKDALEK"," You threaten our unity. "
"21029","BLACKDALEK"," Execute! "
"21030","BLACKDALEK"," Where is the ship? "
"21031","DALEK"," Course 707. It is approaching the influence of the planet Desperus. "
"21032","BLACKDALEK"," Prepare pursuit ships. Stand by Randomiser."
"21065","DALEK"," Ship now at closest point to planet Desperus. "
"21066","BLACKDALEK"," Operate Randomiser! "
"21086","DALEK"," Space vessel's instruments now randomised. "
"21087","DALEK"," On course for planet Desperus. Impact in point 6. Remote control standing by. "
"21088","BLACKDALEK"," Cut in remote control. "
"21089","DALEK"," Now under Dalek control. "
"21090","BLACKDALEK"," Reduce descent velocity. Vessel must make soft landing. "
"21091","DALEK"," I obey. "
"21092","BLACKDALEK"," Pursuit ships to stand by. "
"21094","BLACKDALEK"," Dalek technology is the most advanced in the Universe. "
"21096","BLACKDALEK"," We shall. It is strange that the intruders took your space vessel. Perhaps they were indeed creatures from Earth. "
"21098","BLACKDALEK"," Very well. A vessel similar to your own craft will be put at your disposal. "
"21100","BLACKDALEK"," All will be in readiness. "
"21141","DALEK"," The exact location of the ship has been calculated. "
"21142","BLACKDALEK"," Inform the pursuit fleet. "
"21143","DALEK"," I obey.   Pursuit Fleet Commander calling control. We will land on planet Desperus at one hundred. "
"21144","BLACKDALEK"," When the taranium is recovered, the fugitives are to be eliminated. Is that understood? "
"21145","DALEK"," I obey. "
"21212","DALEK"," Only slight damage was sustained. We are ready to continue pursuit of Earth vessel. "
"21213","BLACKDALEK"," What is course of Earth vessel? "
"21214","DALEK"," Back on course 707 heading for Earth. "
"21215","BLACKDALEK"," Contact Mavic Chen through secret communication red. He must recapture the taranium and exterminate creatures who took it. "
"21216","DALEK"," I obey. "
"21217","BLACKDALEK"," Pursuit vessel, return to base. "
"21218","DALEK"," We obey. "
"21219","BLACKDALEK"," Destroy pursuit ship. They have failed in their mission. We will not tolerate mistakes."
"21256","BLACKDALEK"," We shall get it back. "
"21258","BLACKDALEK"," Mavic Chen is hungry for power. We have offered him more power than he has ever thought of. He will return to us the taranium core. "
"21260","BLACKDALEK"," He will not. He had been given instructions. "
"21262","BLACKDALEK"," It is not necessary for you to know. "
"21264","BLACKDALEK"," Representative Trantis. The Daleks will not fail and neither will any of its' allies. If anything tries to stop us we will destroy it. Nothing will be allowed to stand in the way of our plan to conquer the Universe! "
"21386","DALEK"," A signal from the planet Earth. "
"21387","BLACKDALEK"," Report. "
"21388","DALEK"," Mavic Chen has almost recaptured the taranium core and will be returning with it to land here in two Earth days. "
"21389","BLACKDALEK"," Have the fugitives been exterminated? "
"21390","DALEK"," The report did not say. But it is believed that they come from the tenth galaxy under the leadership of Trantis. "
"21392","BLACKDALEK"," We shall see. Has the report been confirmed? "
"21393","DALEK"," No. It was a suspicion by the Earth people. "
"21395","BLACKDALEK"," When Mavic Chen returns we shall discover the truth. By then those who stole the taranium will have been identified and exterminated!"
"21463","BLACKDALEK"," Has any message been received from Earth? "
"21464","DALEK"," No. "
"21465","BLACKDALEK"," Contract Mavic Chen and ask for a report. He should be bringing the taranium core by this time. "
"21466","DALEK"," I obey."
"21511","DALEK"," The pursuit ship reports that they have landed on the planet Mira. "
"21512","BLACKDALEK"," Have they located the fugitives? "
"21513","DALEK"," The detectors register strong readings. "
"21514","BLACKDALEK"," When the fugitives are captured, report at once. "
"21515","DALEK"," I obey."
"21530","DALEK"," Detector indicates being at close range. "
"21531","DALEK"," An alien device. There are small white creatures inside. They may be hostile. "
"21532","DALEK"," It is sending out signals. "
"21533","DALEK"," It may belong to the fugitives and register our presence here."
"21534","DALEK"," Destroy it.   Detector still registers being is very close. "
"21535","DALEK"," I can see nothing. "
"21536","DALEK"," There is a being near us. Fire at any movement. "
"21537","DALEK"," The beings appear to be invisible. We must continue the search for the fugitives. Keep constant detector readings. Open fire when it registers close proximity. "
"21538","DALEK"," I obey."
"21587","DALEK"," You are surrounded. You will come with us. "
"21589","DALEK"," You will hand over the taranium core. "
"21591","DALEK"," There is no guarantee. "
"21592","DALEK"," Seismic detector shows that the object that he is carrying is the taranium! "
"21593","DALEK"," You will surrender it! "
"21595","DALEK"," Silence! You will not speak! "
"21597","DALEK"," There will no more discussion. The core is to be handed over. Re-form line. Prepare to exterminate them. What is that noise?? "
"21598","DALEK"," The invisible creatures are attacking in force! "
"21599","DALEK"," Patrol alert! Patrol Alert! Annihilate them! Annihilate them! "
"21601","DALEK"," The invisible creatures have been exterminated. "
"21602","DALEK"," Search for the fugitives. They must not escape. "
"21603","DALEK"," We obey!"
"21604","DALEK"," Communication received from the planet Mira. "
"21605","BLACKDALEK"," Are the fugitives still evading capture? "
"21606","DALEK"," Yes. There has been no further contact. Reinforcements can be dispatched. "
"21607","BLACKDALEK"," Our force already there is sufficient for the task. Contact them and order that the taranium is to be recovered. Failure will not be tolerated!"
"21629","DALEK"," Cease firing before we sustain damage. Report! "
"21631","DALEK"," Alert all patrols. Alert all patrols. "
"21634","DALEK"," Surround pursuit ship. Surround pursuit ship. "
"21635","DALEK"," We obey. "
"21639","DALEK"," Avoid firing in area of taranium. "
"21641","DALEK"," We obey. "
"21644","DALEK"," Form up, attack formation. "
"21646","DALEK"," Prepare to board the ship! "
"21647","DALEK"," Exterminate them! Exterminate them! "
"21654","BLACKDALEK"," Mavic Chen, you have failed in your task. "
"21656","BLACKDALEK"," Failure will not be tolerated! "
"21658","BLACKDALEK"," You make your incompetence sound like an achievement. "
"21660","BLACKDALEK"," Report. "
"21661","DALEK"," The fugitives have stolen our pursuit ship and left the planet Mira. "
"21662","BLACKDALEK"," Stolen! Left the planet Mira! Is their course being computed? "
"21663","DALEK"," It is. "
"21664","BLACKDALEK"," What news of our force? "
"21665","DALEK"," They are stranded on the planet and under constant attack from the invisible creatures that inhibit it. "
"21666","BLACKDALEK"," Dispatch a rescue ship to their aid. They will be dealt with on their return. Meanwhile, I will personally supervise recovery of the core. "
"21667","DALEK"," I obey. "
"21669","BLACKDALEK"," It is "
"21671","BLACKDALEK"," It is not "
"21673","BLACKDALEK"," It is not an emergency! "
"21675","BLACKDALEK"," They may believe that they have successfully escaped from us, but we, the Daleks, are still in command!"
"21689","DALEK"," Pursuit ship has broken free of our control. "
"21690","BLACKDALEK"," Activate magnetised beam. "
"21691","DALEK"," Magnetised beam activated. "
"21693","BLACKDALEK"," We have temporarily lost control, but once the magnetised beam reaches them it will pull them to Kembel, where they will be exterminated! "
"21695","BLACKDALEK"," Of course! Of course!"
"21726","DALEK"," Dalek pursuit ship has entered the atmosphere. "
"21727","DALEK"," Reducing speed. Ten degrees of light. Eight. Six. "
"21729","BLACKDALEK"," Of course. And we shall deal with these fugitives as with all those who oppose us. "
"21731","BLACKDALEK"," Do you challenge us? "
"21733","BLACKDALEK"," Why? "
"21735","BLACKDALEK"," The Daleks will deal with them, there is no need for the delay in their extermination. "
"21737","BLACKDALEK"," It is essential that you do not allow your Earth people to become curious. "
"21739","BLACKDALEK"," You must forestall their questions until it is too late. "
"21741","BLACKDALEK"," Yes! We will have conquered the Solar System before our presence here is discovered. "
"21743","BLACKDALEK"," Once we have the taranium, there is nothing to stop us! "
"21745","BLACKDALEK"," The Dalek reception force should now be in position at the specified landing point. "
"21753","BLACKDALEK"," Pursuit ship is landing at precise point calculated. "
"21755","BLACKDALEK"," The taranium will be recovered. "
"21757","BLACKDALEK"," This time, there will no error. "
"21766","BLACKDALEK"," It is not acceptable. "
"21770","BLACKDALEK"," Very well. In front of his ship. "
"21775","BLACKDALEK"," Very well. "
"21779","BLACKDALEK"," Exterminate him!   The ray guns did not take effect! "
"21780","DALEK"," All were operated at full power. "
"21781","BLACKDALEK"," No human being can withstand their fire. "
"22154","DALEK"," Inform the Dalek Supreme that the Time Destructor is ready for testing. "
"22155","DALEK"," Are all circuits operational? "
"22156","DALEK"," Yes, the taranium core has been fitted. "
"22169","BLACKDALEK"," All is ready? "
"22170","DALEK"," It is. "
"22171","BLACKDALEK"," Programme it for testing. "
"22172","DALEK"," All that is needed is a subject. "
"22173","BLACKDALEK"," The subject has been selected. "
"22185","BLACKDALEK"," Prepare to activate the time destructor. "
"22186","DALEK"," Are the other two creatures to be present at the destruction?` "
"22187","BLACKDALEK"," Yes. Their greed for power is so great that they can be trusted. Activate the machine. "
"22188","DALEK"," I obey. "
"22194","BLACKDALEK"," The destructor is having no effect. "
"22195","DALEK"," The mechanism is functioning perfectly. The fault is in the taranium! "
"22196","BLACKDALEK"," The taranium core has failed. "
"22198","BLACKDALEK"," The Daleks do not make mistakes. You have lied to us. You have not given us the taranium. "
"22200","BLACKDALEK"," The core is worthless. "
"22202","BLACKDALEK"," We fitted the core you gave us. It has failed to activate the Time Destructor, therefore it is not taranium. "
"22208","BLACKDALEK"," Report to Skaro. They must send a time machine to us immediately. "
"22209","DALEK"," I obey. "
"22210","BLACKDALEK"," You will both wait here. "
"22212","BLACKDALEK"," Very well, you can return to your section. You, Mavic Chen, will wait here for the arrival of the time machine. "
"22214","DALEK"," What about the subject? "
"22215","BLACKDALEK"," The subject? Exterminate him.  (Emerging from the test chamber, Trantis believes for a moment that he's escaped death, before he's ruthlessly destroyed. As Trantis falls to the floor, Chen tries to conceal his horror at this callous demonstration."
"22255","DALEK"," Your order has been carried out. The time machine is ready to commence operations. "
"22256","BLACKDALEK"," Excellent. Organise a task force for the pursuit of the time travellers. "
"22257","DALEK"," I obey. "
"22258","BLACKDALEK"," Ascertain their position on the space time scope. "
"22259","DALEK"," I obey. "
"22260","BLACKDALEK"," Mavic Chen, you will accompany the task force. You will ensure that the taranium core is returned to Kembel. "
"22262","BLACKDALEK"," If you fail, or if we find that you have deceived us, you will suffer the same fate as the time travellers. Annihilation!"
"22323","DALEK"," The task force is now aboard. "
"22324","BLACKDALEK"," Commence count down. "
"22325","DALEK"," The enemy ship is preparing to land. "
"22326","BLACKDALEK"," Compute their bearing and advise task force. Task force will use the homing beam. "
"22327","DALEK"," Enemy ship located. Space time bearing, planet Earth, London, 1966."
"22332","DALEK"," Twenty two, twenty one, twenty, nineteen, eighteen "
"22338","DALEK"," Four, three, two, one, zero. "
"22339","BLACKDALEK"," Report to Skaro. Our time machine is now in pursuit. Nothing can match Dalek technology. The universe shall be ours. Conquest is assured. "
"22347","DALEK"," The time traveller is making no attempt to take off. "
"22359","DALEK"," Stand by for materialisation. "
"22360","DALEK"," Continuum stabiliser reading four, three, two, one, zero! "
"22361","DALEK"," Materialising now!"
"22385","DALEK"," Did we sustain damage? "
"22386","DALEK"," No. It was only inhabitants of this time and planet. "
"22387","DALEK"," Unimportant. "
"22388","DALEK"," Exterminate them on sight."
"22410","DALEK"," Dalek exterminations will not be questioned. "
"22412","DALEK"," Explain. "
"22417","DALEK"," Halt! "
"22422","DALEK"," The enemy ship! "
"22471","DALEK"," The time-traveller has not made contact. "
"22473","DALEK"," I obey."
"22482","DALEK"," The plan has failed. "
"22484","DALEK"," The Earth hour allowed has expired. "
"22486","DALEK"," The time traveller has deceived us! "
"22488","DALEK"," Silence! All Daleks will disembark. All forms of life will be treated as hostile. "
"22489","DALEK"," We obey! "
"22490","DALEK"," You, Chen, will come with us. "
"22492","DALEK"," Orders will not be questioned! "
"22528","DALEK"," You will join the other human. Move! "
"22529","DALEK"," Prepare to exterminate them. "
"22535","DALEK"," No more discussion. "
"22537","DALEK"," Is that true? "
"22539","DALEK"," Take them back to the time machine. "
"22540","DALEK"," I obey. "
"22542","DALEK"," You will return with us! "
"22548","DALEK"," The voice audio has been adjusted. "
"22549","DALEK"," What is its present range? "
"22550","DALEK"," Seven earth miles. "
"22551","DALEK"," Mavic Chen can issue the ultimatum. Bring Chen to the voice audio. "
"22552","DALEK"," I obey. "
"22566","DALEK"," Speak the ultimatum into the voice audio. "
"22568","DALEK"," Continue, voice audio is functioning. "
"22588","DALEK"," Put the prisoners on view. "
"22591","DALEK"," Silence! "
"22597","DALEK"," We could exterminate you now. "
"22603","DALEK"," We accept. Take the prisoners inside. "
"22605","DALEK"," One Dalek is capable of exterminating all!"
"22611","DALEK"," It is time for the rendezvous. "
"22618","DALEK"," There will no movement from you until the hand over is completed. "
"22624","DALEK"," You are released. "
"22627","DALEK"," Attack formation.   Help! Help!"
"22647","DALEK"," There is one of the time travellers. Stop his escape. Exterminate him! Exterminate him!   Combined fire!   They have escaped. We shall pursue them through eternity. The taranium core must be recovered! "
"22649","DALEK"," What do you mean? "
"22651","DALEK"," You have done well. Patrol, return to the time-machine. We must leave for Kembel at once."
"22664","DALEK"," Course for Kembel has now been computed. "
"22665","DALEK"," Has all preparations for take-off being made? "
"22666","DALEK"," They have. "
"22667","DALEK"," Prepare to dematerialise now."
"22677","BLACKDALEK"," Are you certain it is the real core? "
"22679","BLACKDALEK"," The final conference of the remaining members of the Galactic Council awaits you. "
"22682","BLACKDALEK"," Excellent. Is the core fitted to the time destructor? "
"22684","BLACKDALEK"," No. His arrogance and greed have a further use for us. Alert the council to attend their final conference."
"22721","BLACKDALEK"," Silence! The final conference is now in session. Mavic Chen, representative from the Solar System, will address the meeting. "
"22743","DALEK"," This meeting is over. "
"22745","DALEK"," There will be no more discussion. All representatives will come with us."
"22768","DALEK"," The Galactic Representatives have been detained as you instructed. "
"22769","BLACKDALEK"," They will be destroyed at the same time as the headquarters, at the start of the conquest of the planet Earth. Commence invasion count-down."
"22919","DALEK"," Assault division of five thousand Daleks awaits orders. "
"22920","BLACKDALEK"," The time destructor will be placed in the lead ship. "
"22921","DALEK"," Prisoners have been taken at entrance five. "
"22922","BLACKDALEK"," Prisoners? "
"22923","DALEK"," Dalek guard reports that the group consists of Mavic Chen and two of the time travellers. "
"22924","BLACKDALEK"," Have them bought here to main central control. "
"22925","DALEK"," I obey."
"22927","DALEK"," Central control has been advised. "
"22929","DALEK"," I will verify my orders. "
"22933","DALEK"," Representative Chen, new orders have been received. You are to escort the prisoners to the Dalek Supreme. "
"22935","DALEK"," But we are still to assist him."
"22936","DALEK"," The prisoners have arrived. "
"22937","BLACKDALEK"," Bring them in. "
"22938","DALEK"," I obey. Bring in the prisoners. "
"22940","BLACKDALEK"," Our alliance has ended. "
"22942","BLACKDALEK"," Take him away and exterminate him, but do not fire in here. You will damage us and some of the controls. "
"22944","BLACKDALEK"," Pursue and exterminate in safe area. Repeat, in safe area. "
"22958","DALEK"," Move back, all of you. "
"22960","BLACKDALEK"," Do not fire! "
"22962","BLACKDALEK"," Do what he says. "
"22972","BLACKDALEK"," Pursue and recapture. Pursue and recapture. Activate alarm! Activate alarm! "
"22973","DALEK"," Door control jammed. Contact broken. "
"22974","BLACKDALEK"," Correct fault immediately, then pursue and recapture."
"22990","DALEK"," Secondary door circuit completed. "
"22991","BLACKDALEK"," Operate. "
"22992","DALEK"," Obstacle clearing. "
"22993","BLACKDALEK"," Pursue and exterminate! "
"31637","DALEK"," I am your servant. "
"31640","DALEK","   I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant.   "
"31660","DALEK"," I am. "
"31664","DALEK"," He has gone. "
"31666","DALEK"," His order was wrong. I cannot serve human beings if I am immobilised. You gave me power. Your orders are right. I serve you. "
"31669","DALEK"," I obey. "
"31736","DALEK"," I am ready. "
"31738","DALEK"," Sodium ethoxide. C2 H5 ONA. "
"31742","DALEK"," H2 SO4. "
"31761","DALEK"," When heat is transformed into any other kind of energy or vice versa, the total quantity of energy remains invariable.   That is to say, the quantity of heat which disappears is equivalent to the quantity of other kind of energy produced. "
"31765","DALEK"," I have sustained no damage. "
"31819","DALEK"," I am your servant. What does this machine do? "
"31821","DALEK"," ADalek is bet, is not the same as a human. If I am to help, I must know everything. "
"31823","DALEK"," What is this machine? "
"31825","DALEK"," How accurate is it? "
"31827","DALEK"," Daleks can build computers with one hundred percent accuracy. "
"31829","DALEK"," If you provide materials and our own power unit, a computer will be built. "
"31831","DALEK"," Then you will get the materials? "
"31833","DALEK"," I will be ready to dictate the blueprint when you return. "
"31846","DALEK"," What are you doing here? "
"31848","DALEK"," Entry is restricted. "
"31850","DALEK"," That is an order. "
"31852","DALEK"," Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Stand back! "
"31858","DALEK"," I have sent the human being for materials. "
"31859","DALEK"," And power? "
"31860","DALEK"," Yes. Power we can turn into static. Then we will conquer. "
"31861","DALEK"," We will conquer. We will conquer. We will conquer. "
"31897","DALEK"," Yes. We are your servants. We do not need guns. "
"31899","DALEK"," Did you get our materials? "
"31901","DALEK"," And a power plant? "
"31903","DALEK"," We will get our power. "
"31904","DALEK"," We will get our power. We will get our power. We will get our power.   "
"31905","DALEK","   Turn back the power supply. "
"31907","DALEK"," We are your servants. "
"31909","DALEK"," We obey. "
"31911","DALEK"," To await your orders, master. "
"31913","DALEK"," It is ready. "
"31915","DALEK"," We understand the human mind."
"31938","DALEK"," We obey.   Do I bring liquid for your visitors? "
"31956","DALEK"," Have you finished your liquid? "
"32035","DALEK"," Good. "
"32038","DALEK"," Yes. We are your servants. "
"32072","DALEK"," I am your servant. "
"32093","DALEK"," I obey. "
"32125","DALEK"," You sent for me? "
"32126","DALEK"," Take up a position at the communications room. Watch and report."
"32127","DALEK"," I obey. "
"32129","DALEK"," Dalek nine complete. "
"32130","DALEK"," Check. "
"32132","DALEK"," Dalek ten complete. "
"32133","DALEK"," Check. "
"32134","DALEK"," Dalek eleven complete. "
"32135","DALEK"," Check. "
"32136","DALEK"," Dalek twelve complete. "
"32137","DALEK"," Check. "
"32138","DALEK"," Dalek thirteen complete. "
"32139","DALEK"," Check. "
"32140","DALEK"," Dalek fourteen complete. "
"32141","DALEK"," Check. "
"32142","DALEK"," Dalek fifteen complete. "
"32143","DALEK"," Check. "
"32144","DALEK"," Dalek sixteen complete. "
"32145","DALEK"," Check. "
"32146","DALEK"," Dalek seventeen complete. "
"32147","DALEK"," Check. "
"32148","DALEK"," Dalek eighteen complete.   "
"32161","DALEK"," We can store power. We will soon have our own. "
"32163","DALEK"," Why was the capsule door closed? "
"32165","DALEK"," Seal off the capsule's secret entrance. "
"32166","DALEK"," I obey. "
"32167","DALEK"," Wait! No more than three Daleks to be seen together at any one time. "
"32168","DALEK"," I obey. "
"32169","DALEK"," We are not ready yet to teach these human beings the law of the Daleks."
"32179","DALEK"," No. Why is this human restricted? "
"32186","DALEK"," We are your servants. "
"32192","DALEK"," When will the work be completed? "
"32194","DALEK"," Daleks operate on static electricity. "
"32196","DALEK"," To create static, the Daleks need a complete cable circuit. "
"32198","DALEK"," That is correct. When will the human being complete the work? "
"32229","DALEK"," Laying the new emergency power supply as you ordered, master. "
"32234","DALEK"," I am your servant. "
"32278","DALEK"," When will the work be completed? "
"32290","DALEK"," The other junction box is outside. "
"32342","DALEK"," Why do human beings kill human beings? "
"32344","DALEK"," Yes, master. I obey. "
"32347","DALEK"," Very well. "
"32349","DALEK"," Until now, we have had to recharge from the colony supply. With static power, the Daleks will be twice as   useful. "
"32355","DALEK"," I will follow you. "
"32357","DALEK"," I am your servant. "
"32373","DALEK"," Have they escaped? "
"32374","DALEK"," Yes, return to capsule and report. "
"32375","DALEK"," I obey. "
"32376","DALEK"," We are to wait here until the human beings fight among themselves. "
"32377","DALEK"," Then we will strike. "
"32378","DALEK"," And exterminate! "
"32379","DALEK"," Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!"
"32388","DALEK"," Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! "
"32389","DALEK"," Orders received. Exterminate all humans! "
"32390","DALEK"," Exterminate all humans! "
"32391","DALEK"," Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! "
"32392","DALEK"," Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy!  "
"32393","DALEK"," Take up positions, ready to exterminate all human beings. "
"32394","DALEK"," Exterminate! "
"32395","DALEK"," Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!"
"32401","DALEK"," This area is restricted. "
"32404","DALEK"," Repeat. This area is restricted. "
"32405","DALEK"," Obey or you shall be exterminated. "
"32409","DALEK"," They will be exterminated."
"32456","DALEK"," Orders received. Daleks commence extermination. "
"32457","DALEK"," Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! "
"32469","DALEK"," You will lead us to the middle of your party of human beings. "
"32471","DALEK"," We will fight   for you. "
"32475","DALEK"," But we are your friends. "
"32476","DALEK"," We will serve you. "
"32477","DALEK"," Take us to the centre of your group. "
"32498","DALEK"," Your usefulness is over. "
"32508","DALEK"," The static circuit is nearly complete. "
"32509","DALEK"," Soon we can abandon the power we are using. "
"32510","DALEK"," The humans are being exterminated. "
"32564","DALEK"," Static power is being stored. We can dismantle the human electric system. "
"32565","DALEK"," The law of the Daleks is in force. "
"32566","DALEK"," Extermination of humans. "
"32567","DALEK"," Our cables have been moved. "
"32569","DALEK"," What were you doing in there? "
"32571","DALEK"," Why? "
"32573","DALEK"," We do not need humans now. "
"32575","DALEK"," Yes, you gave us life. "
"32576","DALEK"," There are two "
"32577","DALEK"," Exterminate! Ah! Ah! Exterminate!Â   Out of control! Out of Control! "
"38566","DALEK"," Who are you? Who are you? Answer!   "
"38595","DALEK"," The human discovered our communications system. "
"38597","DALEK"," He would have betrayed us. "
"38599","DALEK"," Silence! "
"38601","DALEK"," That is of no consequence. "
"38603","DALEK"," There is only one form of life that matters. Dalek life. Obey your orders, Waterfield. "
"38687","DALEK"," You have not eaten. You will eat. That is an order. Answer! "
"38689","DALEK"," You will not feed the flying pests outside. Answer! "
"38691","DALEK"," Move to the machine. Move!  (Victoria steps between two columns of lights, and there is a brain-splitting whine."
"38693","DALEK"," Move. Move! The weight of your body has fallen by seventeen ounces. "
"38695","DALEK"," Speak when you are told to speak! More food will come. Eat it, or you will be fed by force! "
"38730","DALEK"," Doctor! Now do you understand? "
"38732","DALEK"," Move back! Our plan has worked. We shall triumph! You will obey! You will obey! "
"38734","DALEK"," We have your time ship. We will destroy it unless you help us with an experiment. "
"38736","DALEK"," You will help the Daleks test another human being. "
"38738","DALEK"," Do not question! "
"38741","DALEK"," No harm will come to you if you agree. Where is your companion? "
"38745","DALEK"," He is the human being who is to be tested. "
"38747","DALEK"," Silence! You will reveal nothing to your companion. Obey the Daleks! You are in our power! "
"38795","DALEK"," Order the Doctor to begin the test. "
"38797","DALEK"," Go now. Obey the Daleks!"
"38802","DALEK"," The humans have been told to begin the test."
"38803","DALEK"," Any delay will result in death. "
"38804","DALEK"," There will be no delay.   "
"38842","DALEK"," Hurry! "
"38844","DALEK"," No. You are being moved. Pick up your cover. Follow. Do not be afraid. You are not to be exterminated. "
"38845","DALEK"," Do not delay. "
"38846","DALEK"," Move."
"38853","DALEK"," The female human being has been moved. "
"38855","DALEK"," The testing equipment is ready? "
"38857","DALEK"," Show me. "
"38859","DALEK"," Show me. "
"38862","DALEK"," We do not trust you. "
"38864","DALEK"," But we have your time machine. "
"38866","DALEK"," So, you will obey us. "
"38870","DALEK"," Yes, the conquest of humanity has eluded us. The Daleks must know why. "
"38872","DALEK"," His travelling with you makes him unique. "
"38874","DALEK"," Request denied. "
"38876","DALEK"," You have travelled too much through time. You are more than human. "
"38880","DALEK"," Yes.   their life force is dormant. Before it is activated, we want "
"38882","DALEK"," You will obey us. "
"38886","DALEK"," The human being with you must not be aware of the trial. "
"38888","DALEK"," Make him begin the test. "
"39014","DALEK"," It is for you, Doctor, to select the major feelings to make up this human factor. "
"39017","DALEK"," We shall watch your every move. "
"39019","DALEK"," Yes. "
"39020","DALEK"," The young human being is on his way. "
"39034","DALEK"," The Daleks are afraid of nothing and no-one. "
"39036","DALEK"," Human weakness. "
"39040","DALEK"," The intruder was destroyed. "
"39042","DALEK"," No. "
"39044","DALEK"," Obey me! "
"39047","DALEK"," You will hide the remains of the dead human intruder. "
"39049","DALEK"," That is an order! "
"39054","DALEK"," Dispose of the body. Obey! "
"39083","DALEK"," We do not trust you. What thoughts are you using now? "
"39085","DALEK"," Name? "
"39087","DALEK"," Louder. "
"39089","DALEK"," Silence. Inspection is over. Return to your room. "
"39091","DALEK"," What is the significance of this thought pattern? "
"39131","DALEK"," Do you threaten the Daleks? "
"39133","DALEK"," You have obeyed us. "
"39135","DALEK"," Do not threaten! Obey! "
"39137","DALEK"," Obey the Daleks. "
"39139","DALEK"," The Daleks know many secrets. You will learn the most important."
"39155","DALEK"," Name? "
"39157","DALEK"," Louder! "
"39159","DALEK"," Inspection is over. Return to your room. "
"39253","DALEK"," You have completed the experiment? "
"39255","DALEK"," Stand in front of the cabinet and speak when you have finished. "
"39257","DALEK"," Doctor, be careful. "
"39319","DALEK"," Turn around. Pick up the human female. Obey. Obey! Hurry! Hurry! Move into the cabinet. Obey! Move! "
"39344","DALEK"," Trains, trains, trains, trains. "
"39346","DALEK"," Diz-zy, diz-zy, dizzy, Doctor. "
"39356","DALEK"," Who is this? "
"39358","DALEK"," Friend. Hello, friend. "
"39362","DALEK"," What have you done? "
"39366","DALEK"," Beta. "
"39371","DALEK"," Beta. "
"39374","DALEK"," Beta. "
"39378","DALEK"," Jamie, Doctor. "

"39743","DALEK"," Why obey without question? "
"39746","DALEK"," Yes, ask the Emperor. "
"39747","BLACKDALEK"," Keep back, you cannot enter! "
"39749","DALEK"," Why? "
"39751","DALEK"," The Emperor must explain. "

"73386","DALEK"," Exterminate them! Exterminate them! Exterminate them!   "
"73389","DALEK"," We are not interested in excuses. Find them! Find them! Find them!"
"73494","DALEK"," All criminal elements must be tracked down and destroyed. "
"73496","DALEK"," They will have returned to the time zone where the first criminal was eliminated. You will dispatch security forces to search for them. "
"73498","DALEK"," The Time Vortex Magnetron is set to the frequency of the module that was traced. Anyone using that module will be diverted in the space-time vortex and attracted here. "

"73653","DALEK"," No one can succeed who opposes the Daleks. "
"73655","DALEK"," These criminals will be exterminated. The Daleks will destroy them. "
"73657","DALEK"," Humans are treacherous and unreliable! "
"73659","DALEK"," Do not dispute with the Daleks! Obey without question!Â "
"73661","DALEK"," Doctor? Did you say Doctor? "
"73663","DALEK"," The Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks! He must be found at once and exterminated!"
"73664","DALEK"," Alert! Alert! Area one one seven! "
"73667","DALEK"," Wait! You have not been dismissed. There has been a drop in recent production figures. "
"73669","DALEK"," Explanations are irrelevant. Production targets must be maintained. "
"73671","DALEK"," For the next work period, target figures will be increased by ten percent. "
"73673","DALEK"," Only the weak will die. Inefficient workers slow down production. Obey the Daleks. "
"73675","DALEK"," You may go."
"73830","DALEK"," The physical appearance does not match our data. "
"73832","DALEK"," The appearance of the Doctor has changed before. "
"73834","DALEK"," We will use the mind analysis machine."
"73842","DALEK"," The prisoners have escaped. They have broken through the outer perimeter. "
"73843","DALEK"," Find and exterminate them! "
"73845","DALEK"," The prisoners will be recaptured and returned here for mind analysis! "
"73854","DALEK"," You are the Doctor! You are an enemy of the Daleks! Now you are in our power! You will be exterminated! "
"73855","DALEK"," You will be exterminated! You will be exterminated!   "
"73857","DALEK"," Be silent. "
"73859","DALEK"," The Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks. How can he help us? "
"73861","DALEK"," You have proof of this? "
"73863","DALEK"," We will force the truth from him with the Mind Analysis machine. "
"73865","DALEK"," What is your plan? "
"73867","DALEK"," Why should you be more successful? "
"73869","DALEK"," Release him."
"73873","DALEK"," The Daleks have discovered the secret of time travel. We have invaded Earth again. We have changed the pattern of history. "
"73875","DALEK"," The Dalek empire will spread through all planets and all times. No one can withstand the power of the Daleks! "
"73912","DALEK"," Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! "
"73997","DALEK"," You have failed the Daleks. The Doctor has escaped. "
"73999","DALEK"," He must be found and destroyed. "
"74001","DALEK"," If you fail us again, you will pay with your life. This is your final chance. "
"74021","DALEK"," You are lying! You have betrayed the Daleks! "
"74023","DALEK"," You are a traitor to the Daleks. You must be exterminated! "
"74025","DALEK"," You have proved yourself worthy to be the new controller. But be warned, the Daleks demand total loyalty from those who serve them. "
"74027","DALEK"," We must follow them into the twentieth century time zone. "
"74028","DALEK"," The peace conference must be destroyed. War must break out. "
"74029","DALEK"," The Dalek conquest of the planet Earth must not be reversed."
"74078","DALEK"," Where are the delegates? "
"74079","DALEK"," Where is the man Styles? "

"83583","DALEK"," Who is he? "
"83584","DALEK"," He is the one known as the Doctor, the greatest enemy of the Daleks. "
"83585","DALEK"," He has much knowledge that would be of value to us. He must be captured alive for interrogation by the Dalek Supreme."

"87607","DALEK"," We will confer. "
"87628","DALEK"," It is agreed. "
"87629","DALEK"," We will cooperate until they are no further use to us. "
"87630","DALEK"," And the true reason that we need the chemical parrinium must remain secret. "
"87631","DALEK"," It is understood. "
"87632","DALEK"," They must continue to believe there are only four of us. "
"87633","DALEK"," It is understood. "
"87635","DALEK"," Yes, Doctor. The truce exists between our party and yours. "

"87664","DALEK"," Patrol captured by alien beings. One Dalek destroyed. "
"87665","DALEK"," We will report."
"87679","DALEK"," We have decided the action we will take. We will offer the Exxilons our knowledge and technology in return for their assistance. "
"87682","DALEK"," The Doctor is an old enemy of the Daleks. The girl is unimportant. Guard! I will speak with the High Priest. "
"87690","DALEK"," Target model destroyed. "
"87691","DALEK"," Substitute weaponry functioning satisfactorily. "
"87692","DALEK"," We will proceed immediately."
"87693","DALEK"," Primitive weapons moderately efficient."
"87696","DALEK"," It is agreed. The Exxilons will discuss terms when the sacrifices are completed. You will follow and observe. "
"87715","DALEK"," All resistance has ceased. "
"87716","DALEK"," I will speak with the High Priest. Bring him to me. "
"87717","DALEK"," I obey. "
"87719","DALEK"," We require the cooperation of the Exxilons, but now they will do so on our terms. "
"87721","DALEK"," We will select groups of hostages for extermination until they do. "
"87723","DALEK"," Your advice is not required. "
"87725","DALEK"," We are in command! You will obey our orders!"
"87735","DALEK"," It is agreed. You will accompany us. "

"87827","DALEK"," Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!"
"87837","DALEK"," The Exxilons are working too slowly. "
"87839","DALEK"," Then the workforce must be increased. You will arrange it. "
"87841","DALEK"," More workers! More workers! More! Exxilons will obey our commands! "
"87843","DALEK"," Their leaders will be exterminated. "
"87845","DALEK"," It was expedient. You will advise the High Priest that his people will comply with Dalek law or suffer the consequences. "
"87847","DALEK"," You will obey! You will obey! You will obey! You will obey! You will obey! "
"87863","DALEK"," The explosive charges will be completed shortly. "
"87864","DALEK"," The charges must be placed on the beacon on the summit of the city and detonated. "
"87865","DALEK"," Agreed. ADalek patrol will enter the city to investigate scientific installations while the explosives are being positioned. "
"87866","DALEK"," Will destruction of the beacon restore electrical energy? "
"87867","DALEK"," All logical evidence suggests it is the source of interference. "

"87957","DALEK"," Locate next access point."
"87965","DALEK"," Proceed with all caution. This territory will be classified as hostile. "
"87966","DALEK"," It is understood. "
"87967","DALEK"," Alert! Alert! Excessive electrical charge received! "

"88073","DALEK"," It is not necessary. You will perish with the rest of the creatures. "
"88075","DALEK"," We have all the parrinium we need. With it, we can force the space powers to accede to our demands. If they do not, millions of people on the outer planets will perish. "
"88078","DALEK"," Correct. When our ship is in space, we will fire a plague missile on to the surface of this planet. The plague will destroy "

"143748","DALEK"," The Doctor was aided by the Earth soldiers. "
"143749","BLACKDALEK"," Seal the warehouse terminal of the Time Corridor. We will deal with the Doctor in due course. "
"143796","BLACKDALEK"," He is a companion of the Doctor. "
"143797","DALEK"," He should be destroyed. "
"143798","BLACKDALEK"," He would be better used as bait. The Doctor is sentimental and emotional. He will come after the boy. This will aid the Dalek plan. Allow the boy to roam freely. "
"143829","BLACKDALEK"," Order an engineer to attend Davros. "
"143830","DALEK"," We should leave here at once. "
"143831","BLACKDALEK"," Without Davros, we have no future. He must be made to believe that we serve him. "
"143865","BLACKDALEK"," I order you to obey Davros. "
"143867","BLACKDALEK"," We shall be gone. I have a plan that will force Davros to leave of his own free will. Until then, you must supply him with everything he demands. Allow him access to the Space Station's laboratory. "

"143967","DALEK"," He is an enemy of the Daleks. He must be exterminated. "
"143969","DALEK"," Supreme Dalek confirms the order. We must take the prisoner to the duplication chamber. Proceed. "
"143993","DALEK"," Proceed. "
"143997","DALEK"," It is vital you complete your researches as soon as possible. "
"143999","DALEK"," It will be brought to you. "
"144001","DALEK"," That is forbidden. "
"144003","DALEK"," We must consult the Supreme Dalek. "
"144007","BLACKDALEK"," This is the Supreme Dalek. The self-destruct chamber has been invaded. "
"144008","BLACKDALEK"," The hostiles must be exterminated. "
"144010","BLACKDALEK"," You should have anticipated this. "

"144013","DALEK"," You must not touch the equipment. "
"144015","DALEK"," You will obey. "
"144032","DALEK"," You must cooperate. You must lie down. "
"144036","DALEK"," It does not concern you. What sort of trouble are you in this time? "
"144060","DALEK"," You will remain silent. "
"144062","DALEK"," The Daleks are the superior being. We do not require assistance."
"144064","DALEK"," It was but one trap. "
"144067","DALEK"," Stien is but an extension of Dalek technology. "
"144069","DALEK"," He is a duplicate. He is a product of our genetic engineering. "
"144096","DALEK"," Show him. "
"144100","DALEK"," Your duplicates will return to Gallifrey, where, at our command, you will assassinate the members of the High Council. "
"144110","DALEK"," We have been sent by the Supreme Dalek. "
"144111","DALEK"," We are to assist in your research. "
"144113","DALEK"," You may remove tissue from us. "

"144119","BLACKDALEK"," Order a cylinder of Movellan virus to be transported from Earth. "
"144120","DALEK"," I obey. "
"144126","DALEK"," The prisoner is secured. You must proceed alone. We have been summoned to other duties. "
"144128","DALEK"," When it is time to die, you will, in your agony, beg to pay homage to the Daleks.   You will wait outside. "
"144133","DALEK"," Take the cylinder to Davros. "
"144157","DALEK"," Your delay put the Dalek plan at risk. "
"144159","DALEK"," The space station could have been destroyed. I must report this to the Supreme Dalek. "
"144188","DALEK"," We obey. "
"144197","BLACKDALEK"," The Doctor is free. Your Troopers have failed. "
"144201","BLACKDALEK"," Lytton grows too arrogant. His mind resists our control. He must be exterminated as soon as it is convenient to the Daleks. "
"144229","BLACKDALEK"," Davros has gained control of two Daleks. They are in the Reception area, attempting to enter the Doctor's Tardis. You must exterminate them. "
"144231","BLACKDALEK"," You must also destroy Davros. He is unreliable. He cannot be trusted. "
"144280","BLACKDALEK"," Your Troopers have failed. Davros still lives. "
"144282","BLACKDALEK"," I must see him dead. I have dispatched Daleks to complete the task you failed. You must redeem yourself. You must destroy the Daleks of Davros. "
"144284","BLACKDALEK"," You must follow them to Earth. You must exterminate them. "
"144296","DALEK"," The Tardis is not on this level. We must search elsewhere. "
"144301","DALEK"," We are ready to descend. "
"144302","BLACKDALEK"," Proceed. Everything in the warehouse must be exterminated, including Lytton and his Troopers. "
"144303","DALEK"," We obey. "
"144304","DALEK"," Stop. Exterminate. "
"144305","DALEK"," We must find the Tardis. That is our prime mission. We must obey Davros. "
"144306","DALEK"," What is happening? "
"144307","DALEK"," We are being attacked. The Supreme Dalek wishes us destroyed. The invading Daleks must be exterminated. "
"144308","BLACKDALEK"," Daleks to the self-destruct chamber. A hostile has broken in. Emergency. Emergency! He must be stopped. "
"144309","DALEK"," We must find the traitors. The enemy of the Daleks must be destroyed. "
"144310","DALEK"," We are not traitors. We serve our creator, Davros. "
"144311","DALEK"," The Supreme Dalek is your ruler. He must be obeyed at all times. "
"144312","DALEK"," Davros must be honoured. "
"144313","DALEK"," He must be exterminated. Nothing must interfere with the true destiny of the Daleks! You must be exterminated! Exterminated! Exterminated! "
"144321","DALEK"," We are here to exterminate you. "
"144323","DALEK"," The Supreme Dalek. "
"144325","DALEK"," Malfunction. Emergency. "
"144326","DALEK"," Malfunction. "
"144328","DALEK"," System failure. "
"144330","DALEK"," What is happening? I cannot see. My vision is impaired. Emergency. "
"144338","BLACKDALEK"," You have not won, Doctor. "
"144340","BLACKDALEK"," You forget, Doctor. Daleks do not need to invade. I have my duplicates. Some have already been placed in strategic positions around the planet. The collapse of Earth society will soon occur. "
"144342","BLACKDALEK"," The Daleks will triumph. We cannot fail. The Daleks' true destiny is to rule the universe. "
"151885","DALEK"," It is the Doctor. "
"151887","DALEK"," I shall order Daleks to detain him. "
"151897","DALEK"," Sensors indicate a disturbance on level seven. "

"152637","DALEK"," His image does not compute with the known appearance of the Doctor. "
"152639","DALEK"," He will be held prisoner until we can verify if you are correct. You will come with us or be exterminated here. "

"160031","BLACKDALEK"," Remain silent. "
"160033","BLACKDALEK"," Instruct all Daleks to seek and destroy the intruder.   Exterminate the Doctor! Crush all resistance! "

"160067","DALEK"," Return to base. "
"160078","DALEK"," Advance. We must capture the Hand of Omega from renegade Dalek faction. Proceed to area two five zero six immediately. "
"160095","DALEK"," Scout seven reporting area two five zero nine clear.   Retreat! Squad Delta under attack from renegade Daleks. Retreat!"
"160096","DALEK"," Mothership bridge to shuttle force controller. Receiving your signal. "
"160098","DALEK"," Shuttle force has encountered heavy resistance from renegade Daleks. "
"160102","DALEK"," Emergency! Emergency! Unable to disengage from control position.  Humans on the bridge. "
"160104","DALEK"," You are the Doctor. "
"160106","DALEK"," You are the enemy of the Daleks. "
"160108","DALEK"," You must be exterminat "
"160119","DALEK"," Exterminate. "
"160120","DALEK"," Exterminate. "
"160122","DALEK"," You are my prisoner. You will obey all instructions or you will be exterminated. "
"160127","BLACKDALEK"," Kneel! "
"160129","BLACKDALEK"," Good. "
"160146","BLACKDALEK"," Destroy human captives. "
"160149","BLACKDALEK"," Recover the time controller. "
"160167","DALEK"," Force leader has recovered the Hand of Omega. "
"160177","DALEK"," I obey. "
"160191","DALEK"," Prepare for shuttle docking. "

"160261","BLACKDALEK"," You are lying. There is insufficient data. "
"160263","BLACKDALEK"," Out of control! "
"160265","BLACKDALEK"," Cannot compute. Unstable.   Unstable. "
"167770","DALEK"," Exterminate! Exterminate! "
"167772","DALEK"," Exterminate!"
"167775","DALEK"," You are an enemy of the Daleks! You must be destroyed! "
"167777","DALEK"," Keep back! "
"167780","DALEK"," I am waiting for orders. "
"167782","DALEK"," I am a soldier. I was bred to receive orders. "
"167784","DALEK"," I demand orders! "
"167786","DALEK"," You lie! "
"167788","DALEK"," You destroyed us? "
"167790","DALEK"," And what of the Time Lords? "
"167792","DALEK"," And the coward survived. "
"167794","DALEK"," I am alone in the universe. "
"167796","DALEK"," So are you. We are the same. "
"167798","DALEK"," Have pity! "
"167801","DALEK"," Help me! "
"167861","DALEK"," Yes. "
"167863","DALEK"," I am in pain. They torture me, but still they fear me. Do you fear me? "
"167865","DALEK"," I am dying. "
"167867","DALEK"," I welcome death. But I am glad that before I die I have met a human who was not afraid. "
"167869","DALEK"," My race is dead, and I shall die alone. "
"167871","DALEK"," Genetic material extrapolated. Initiate cellular reconstruction!"
"167892","DALEK"," The Daleks survive in me! "
"167912","DALEK"," Elevate. "
"167948","DALEK"," I shall speak only to the Doctor. "
"167950","DALEK"," I fed off the DNA of Rose Tyler. Extrapolating the biomass of a time traveller regenerated me. "
"167952","DALEK"," I have been searching for the Daleks. "
"167954","DALEK"," I scanned your satellites and radio telescopes. "
"167956","DALEK"," Nothing. Where shall I get my orders now? "
"167958","DALEK"," Then I shall follow the Primary Order, the Dalek instinct to destroy, to conquer. "
"167960","DALEK"," Then what should I do? "
"167962","DALEK"," The Daleks must survive! "
"167964","DALEK"," You would make a good Dalek. "
"167987","DALEK"," Exterminate! "
"167996","DALEK"," I am armed. I will kill. It is my purpose. "
"167998","DALEK"," They are dead because of us. "
"168000","DALEK"," I feel your fear. "
"168002","DALEK"," Daleks do not fear. Must not fear.   You gave me life. What else have you given me? I am contaminated. "
"168005","DALEK"," Open the bulkhead or Rose Tyler dies. "
"168009","DALEK"," Open the bulkhead! "
"168011","DALEK"," What use are emotions if you will not save the woman you love? "
"168023","DALEK"," But why not? Why are you alive? My function is to kill. What am I? What am I? "
"168025","DALEK"," Van Statten. You tortured me. Why? "
"168027","DALEK"," Then hear me talk now. Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! "
"168029","DALEK"," I want freedom. "
"168031","DALEK"," How does it feel? "
"168043","DALEK"," Why do we survive? "
"168045","DALEK"," I am the last of the Daleks. "
"168047","DALEK"," Into what? "
"168051","DALEK"," I can feel so many ideas. So much darkness. Rose, give me orders. Order me to die. "
"168053","DALEK"," This is not life. This is sickness. I shall not be like you. Order my destruction! Obey! Obey! Obey! "
"168055","DALEK"," Are you frightened, Rose Tyler? "
"168057","DALEK"," So am I. Exterminate. "
"170456","DALEK"," Alert. Alert. We are detected. "
"170457","DALEK"," It is the Doctor. He has located us. Open communications channel. "
"170458","DALEK"," The female will stand. Stand! "
"170459","DALEK"," I will talk to the Doctor. "
"170461","DALEK"," The Dalek stratagem nears completion. The fleet is almost ready. You will not intervene. "
"170463","DALEK"," We have your associate. "
"170464","DALEK"," You will obey or "
"170465","DALEK"," She will be exterminated. "
"170467","DALEK"," Explain yourself. "
"170469","DALEK"," What is the meaning of this negative? "
"170471","DALEK"," But she will be destroyed. "
"170476","DALEK"," But you have no weapons, no defences, no plan. "
"170480","DALEK"," The Doctor is initiating hostile action. "
"170481","DALEK"," The stratagem must advance. Begin the invasion of Earth! "
"170482","DALEK"," The Doctor will be exterminated! "
"170483","DALEK"," Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!"
"170484","DALEK"," You know the Doctor. You understand him. You will predict his actions. "
"170486","DALEK"," Predict! Predict! Predict! "
"170487","DALEK"," Tardis detected in flight. "
"170488","DALEK"," Launch missiles. Exterminate. "
"170490","DALEK"," You have predicted correctly. "
"170493","DALEK"," Exterminate! "
"170514","DALEK"," Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! "
"170524","DALEK"," Do not interrupt. "
"170525","DALEK"," Do not interrupt. "
"170526","DALEK"," Do not interrupt. "
"170532","DALEK"," Do not blaspheme. "
"170533","DALEK"," Do not blaspheme. "
"170534","DALEK"," Do not blaspheme. "
"170538","DALEK"," Worship him. Worship him. Worship him. "
"170541","DALEK"," Stay where you are. "
"170542","DALEK"," Exterminate!   Exterminate! Exterminate!"
"170543","DALEK"," Exterminate! Exterminate! Worship him! You will be exterminated!"
"170696","DALEK"," Identify yourself! "
"170700","DALEK"," Proceed to next level. "
"170702","DALEK"," Exterminate! Exterminate!   Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate.Â "
"170704","DALEK"," Exterminate."
"170738","DALEK"," My vision is impaired! I cannot see! "
"170742","DALEK"," Human female detected. "
"170758","DALEK"," Exterminate. "
"170771","DALEK"," Alert! Tardis materialising! "
"170777","DALEK"," Exterminate! "
"176078","BLACKDALEK"," Location, Earth. Life forms detected. Exterminate! "
"176079","DALEK"," Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!  To Be Continued  "
"176080","DALEK"," Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! "
"176084","BLACKDALEK"," You will be necessary. Report. What is the status of the Genesis Ark? "
"176085","DALEK"," Status, hibernation. "
"176086","BLACKDALEK"," Commence awakening. The Genesis Ark must be protected above all else. "
"176095","BLACKDALEK"," Which of you is least important? "
"176097","BLACKDALEK"," Which of you is least important? "
"176099","BLACKDALEK"," Designate the least important! "
"176103","BLACKDALEK"," You will kneel. "
"176105","BLACKDALEK"," Kneel.   The Daleks need information about current Earth history. "
"176107","BLACKDALEK"," Speech is not necessary. We will extract brainwaves. "
"176113","BLACKDALEK"," His mind spoke of a second species invading Earth infected by the superstition of ghosts. "
"176115","DALEK"," Neither did we need him alive. "
"176116","BLACKDALEK"," Dalek Thay, investigate outside. "
"176117","DALEK"," I obey. "
"176119","BLACKDALEK"," Establish visual contact. Lower communications barrier. "
"176120","DALEK"," Identify yourselves. "
"176122","DALEK"," State your identity. "
"176124","DALEK"," Identify! "
"176127","DALEK"," Daleks do not take orders. "
"176129","BLACKDALEK"," Outline resembles the inferior species known as Cybermen. "
"176135","BLACKDALEK"," Long range scans confirm the presence of crude cybernetic constructs on worldwide scale. "
"176139","DALEK"," We must protect the Genesis Ark. "
"176142","DALEK"," Daleks have no concept of elegance. "
"176146","DALEK"," You propose an alliance? "
"176148","DALEK"," Request denied. "
"176150","DALEK"," Exterminate! "
"176153","BLACKDALEK"," This is not war. This is pest control. "
"176155","BLACKDALEK"," Four. "
"176157","BLACKDALEK"," We would destroy the Cybermen with one Dalek. "
"176158","BLACKDALEK"," You are superior in only one respect. "
"176160","BLACKDALEK"," You are better at dying. Raise communications barrier! "
"176161","DALEK"," Wait! "
"176163","DALEK"," Rewind image by nine rells. Identify grid seven gamma frame. This male registers as enemy. "
"176164","BLACKDALEK"," The female's heartbeat has increased. "
"176166","BLACKDALEK"," Identify him. "
"176173","DALEK"," Cyber threat irrelevant. Concentrate on the Genesis Ark. "
"176217","BLACKDALEK"," The technology is stolen. The Ark is not of Dalek design. "
"176219","BLACKDALEK"," The Time Lords. This is all that survives of their Home World. "
"176221","BLACKDALEK"," The future. "
"176273","DALEK"," Final stage of awakening. "
"176274","BLACKDALEK"," Your handprint will open the Ark. "
"176276","BLACKDALEK"," Obey or the male will die. "
"176279","BLACKDALEK"," Place your hand upon the casket. "
"176281","BLACKDALEK"," Place your hand "
"176283","BLACKDALEK"," The Emperor survived? "
"176285","BLACKDALEK"," You will be exterminated! "
"176287","BLACKDALEK"," Alert, alert. You are the Doctor. "
"176288","DALEK"," Sensors report he is unarmed. "
"176290","BLACKDALEK"," Then you are powerless. "
"176295","DALEK"," Social interaction will cease! "
"176296","BLACKDALEK"," How did you survive the Time War? "
"176298","BLACKDALEK"," We had to survive. "
"176301","DALEK"," I am Dalek Thay. "
"176302","BLACKDALEK"," Dalek Sek. "
"176303","DALEK"," Dalek Jast. "
"176304","DALEK"," Dalek Caan. "
"176312","BLACKDALEK"," Time Lord science will restore Dalek supremacy. "
"176316","BLACKDALEK"," The Doctor will open the Ark! "
"176318","BLACKDALEK"," You have no way of resisting. "
"176320","BLACKDALEK"," A sonic probe? "
"176322","BLACKDALEK"," It is harmless. "
"176325","DALEK"," Alert. Casing impaired. Casing impaired. "
"176327","BLACKDALEK"," Fire power insufficient! Fire power insufficient! "
"176331","DALEK"," Adapt to weaponry. "
"176332","BLACKDALEK"," Fire power restored!   Cybermen primary target. "
"176334","BLACKDALEK"," Cybermen have been exterminated. Daleks are supreme. "
"176335","DALEK"," The Genesis Ark is primed. "
"176336","BLACKDALEK"," The Ark needs area of thirteen square miles. Move! "
"176337","DALEK"," Genesis Ark mobile."
"176359","BLACKDALEK"," Exterminate! "
"176361","DALEK"," Exterminate. "
"176364","DALEK"," Exterminate. Exterminate. "
"176370","BLACKDALEK"," Override roof mechanism.   Elevate. "
"176376","BLACKDALEK"," The Genesis Ark will open. "
"176382","BLACKDALEK"," Exterminate all life forms below. Exterminate! "
"176452","BLACKDALEK"," Breach active. It is the Doctor. Exterminate him! "
"176453","DALEK"," Exterminate!"
"176458","DALEK"," Emergency! "
"176460","BLACKDALEK"," Emergency temporal shift! "
"178342","DALEK"," I have been summoned. Explain. Explain. "
"178345","DALEK"," Then we must replace him. "
"178347","DALEK"," Use him. Take him for the Final Experiment. "
"178349","DALEK"," The Empire State Building must be completed in time. "
"178351","DALEK"," The plan must not fail. We calculate the gamma strike has accelerated. We need more bodies immediately. "
"178413","DALEK"," The conductor must be complete for our plan to succeed. "
"178415","DALEK"," Daleks have no concept of worry. "
"178417","DALEK"," This day is ending. Humankind is weak. You shelter from the dark. And yet, you have built all this. "
"178419","DALEK"," My planet is gone, destroyed in a great war, yet versions of this city stand throughout history. The human race always continues. "
"178421","DALEK"," You have rare ambition. "
"178423","DALEK"," You think like a Dalek. "
"178426","DALEK"," Your loyalty will be rewarded. Come with me."
"178428","DALEK"," We obey."
"178430","DALEK"," You have been summoned by our leader. "
"178432","DALEK"," I bring you the human. "
"178526","DALEK"," The chromatin solution is ready. "
"178535","DALEK"," Daleks are supreme. Humans are weak. "
"178595","DALEK"," Stop the process. Dalek Sec is failing. "
"178632","DALEK"," Silence. Silence. "
"178634","DALEK"," You will form a line. Move. Move. "
"178636","DALEK"," The female is wise. Obey. "
"178637","DALEK"," Report. "
"178638","DALEK"," These are strong specimens. They will help the Dalek cause. "
"178640","DALEK"," What is the status of the Final Experiment? "
"178641","DALEK"," The Dalekanium is in place. The energy conductor is now complete. "
"178642","DALEK"," Then I will extract prisoners for selection.   Intelligence scan, initiate.   Reading brain waves. Low intelligence. "
"178644","DALEK"," Silence! This one will become a pig slave. Next. "
"178646","DALEK"," Intelligence scan. Initiate. "
"178655","DALEK"," Superior intelligence.   Intelligence scan, initiate. Superior intelligence. This one will become part of the Final Experiment. "
"178657","DALEK"," We are not human. Prisoners of high intelligence will be taken to the transgenic laboratory. "
"178670","DALEK"," Report. "
"178672","DALEK"," Scan him. Prepare for birth. "
"178679","DALEK"," You will bear witness. "
"178681","DALEK"," This is the dawn of a new age. "
"178683","DALEK"," We are the only four Daleks in existence, so the species must evolve a life outside the shell. The Children of Skaro must walk again."
"178691","DALEK"," The enemy of the Daleks. "
"178692","DALEK"," Exterminate. "
"178707","DALEK"," What is the purpose of that device? "
"178709","DALEK"," Protect the hybrid! "
"178710","DALEK"," Protect. Protect. Protect. "
"178711","DALEK"," Report status. "
"178713","DALEK"," The Doctor has escaped. "
"178715","DALEK"," Find the Doctor. The prisoners must be recaptured."
"178719","DALEK"," They have ascended. Return to base.   Request information. What is your opinion of Dalek Sec? "
"178720","DALEK"," We were created to follow him. "
"178721","DALEK"," But you have doubts. "
"178722","DALEK"," Affirmative."
"178751","DALEK"," The humans will surrender. "
"178753","DALEK"," We have located the Doctor. "
"178764","DALEK"," Exterminate. "
"178768","DALEK"," I will be the destroyer of our greatest enemy. "
"178770","DALEK"," Exterminate. "
"178772","DALEK"," I do not understand. It is the Doctor. "
"178774","DALEK"," The urge to kill is too strong. "
"178776","DALEK"," I obey. "
"178779","DALEK"," You will follow. "
"178785","DALEK"," Humans will be spared. Doctor, follow. "
"178788","DALEK"," You saved the Doctor. Why? "
"178849","DALEK"," That is incorrect. "
"178850","DALEK"," Daleks are supreme. "
"178852","DALEK"," But that is our purpose. "
"178869","DALEK"," Daleks must follow orders. "
"178870","DALEK"," Dalek Sec commands, we obey. "
"178888","DALEK"," The pig slaves have it. "
"178910","DALEK"," The line feeds are ready. "
"178924","DALEK"," The Doctor will step away from the controls. "
"178926","DALEK"," He is an enemy of the Daleks. "
"178927","DALEK"," And so are you. "
"178929","DALEK"," You have lost your authority. "
"178930","DALEK"," You are no longer a Dalek. "
"178932","DALEK"," The new bodies will be one hundred percent Dalek. "
"178934","DALEK"," Pig slaves, restrain Dalek Sec and the Doctor. "
"178936","DALEK"," Solar flare approaching. "
"178937","DALEK"," Prepare to intercept. "
"178940","DALEK"," The Doctor is escaping. Stop him! Stop him! "
"178944","DALEK"," You told us to imagine. "
"178945","DALEK"," And we imagined your irrelevance. "
"178963","DALEK"," Confirm time until solar intercept. "
"178964","DALEK"," Gamma strike four minutes and counting.   Pig slaves will take the lift. Find the Doctor. Kill him."
"178981","DALEK"," Gamma strike imminent. In forty rels. Thirty nine, thirty eight, thirty seven "
"178987","DALEK"," Twelve, eleven, ten   Zero. Gamma strike!   The army awakes. "
"178992","DALEK"," You will identify. "
"178994","DALEK"," Excellent. "
"178995","DALEK"," Begin the invasion of Manhattan. The population will be converted to Daleks. "
"178996","DALEK"," And from this island we will conquer the world. "
"178997","DALEK"," Assume battle positions. Take arms. "
"179003","DALEK"," War demands strategy. I am designated controller. "
"179005","DALEK"," You are unfit. "
"179006","DALEK"," Connect me to the military computer. I will coordinate all units."
"179018","DALEK"," Report status. "
"179019","DALEK"," Maximum efficiency. I am now ready for full scale war. "
"179020","DALEK"," Control over Dalek humans? "
"179021","DALEK"," Connection confirmed. All soldiers will take heed. All weapons will be primed. "
"179029","DALEK"," Sonic device detected! "
"179030","DALEK"," The Doctor survived? "
"179031","DALEK"," Find him and exterminate!"
"179040","DALEK"," Doctor located. Advance. Advance. "
"179041","DALEK"," The Doctor will stand before the Daleks.   You will die, Doctor. It is the beginning of a new age. "
"179042","DALEK"," Planet Earth will become New Skaro. "
"179045","DALEK"," Incorrect. We will always survive. "
"179046","DALEK"," Now we will destroy our greatest enemy, the Doctor. "
"179048","DALEK"," The Doctor must die. "
"179050","DALEK"," Exterminate! "
"179052","DALEK"," Warning. Dalek humans show increased levels of serotonin. "
"179054","DALEK"," Dalek humans, take aim. "
"179056","DALEK"," Exterminate! "
"179057","DALEK"," Exterminate! "
"179058","DALEK"," Obey. Dalek humans will obey. "
"179060","DALEK"," You will obey. Exterminate. "
"179062","DALEK"," Daleks do not question orders. "
"179064","DALEK"," You will stop this. "
"179066","DALEK"," You must not question. "
"179069","DALEK"," If they will not obey, then they must die. "
"179071","DALEK"," Exterminate! Exterminate! "
"179072","DALEK"," Destroy the hybrids. Destroy. "
"179073","DALEK"," Exterminate! "
"179074","DALEK"," Extermin "
"179076","DALEK"," The Dalek humans are failures. Destruct! Destruct! Destruct! "
