The witches of Devil's End, the famous curse, the notorious cavern underneath the church where the third Lord of Aldbourne played at his eighteen century parody of black magic. Devil's End is part of the dark mythology of our childhood days. And now, for the first time, the cameras of the BBC have been allowed inside the cavern itself. In this cavern, pagan man performed his unspeakable rites. In this cavern, the witches of the seventeenth century hid from the fires of Matthew Hopkins, witch-hunter extraordinary. In this cavern.

98559," Yes, that's why I came here. ",Classic
20403,   It is the Trojan Horse. But I thought you ,Classic
107056," Oh, this is the ultimate archaeology, Adam. It was data from here which led me to the excavation sites in Kenya. And when we had excavated the skull and assembled it and Thea had dated it, then the real work of this machine could begin. ",Classic
156869, But that would take it above the danger level. ,Classic

103826, You came close to ruining my plans. It's fitting I should make you suffer for that. ,Classic
141085," It seems Rassilon possesses it now, and is willing to share it with whoever takes the ring. ",Classic

106239," Doctor, what's wrong?   Doctor, what was all that? ",Classic
120057," Well, Engineer Doran, in his latest paper on the subject, has proved conclusively that it is part of an ancient building. Perhaps a temple. ",Classic
165610," Come on, Paterson! ",Classic
85759," Master, I heard somebody call Doctor while we were at that fellow's heels. ",Classic
75343, I hope that you're right. ,Classic
23478," No. Bondeaux already has his orders. You may tell the Abbot that also, when you find him. Is that clear? ",Classic
89660," Thank you very much, Doctor. Actually the secret of it is, is to get the water ",Classic
49991," One eighty, one ninety. ",Classic
153861, It's blowing up! ,Classic
140862," Well, as you can see, he was armed and trying to escape. ",Classic

59705," Yes, sir.   Good, thank you. Ambulance spotted, sir. ",Classic
36893," I've got them, Doc. Two switches. What next?",Classic

120453, They're coming! ,Classic
29143, Kewper. ,Classic
107646, Here! ,Classic
5512, It is here. ,Classic
60719," Smythe, 1917 zone. I have recaptured three of the escaped prisoners. ",Classic
64028," No, no. No, it's just a minor technical fault. We'll soon put that right.   There you are. That's fixed it. ",Classic
98389, Doctor. ,Classic
89695," Oh, Doctor, really! ",Classic
78331, An ambulance is on its way. ,Classic
77758, Where would it be then? ,Classic
7978," No, no, no. Something hit me under the heart and it was most unpleasant. It was a good thing I sent you that antidote. Otherwise I might have been in a much worse state than I was.  ",Classic
90733, Stolen? Who by? ,Classic
67816, It's the boy's attitude I can't understand. ,Classic
43042, We need her to draw an intelligent being from the base. ,Classic

97491," Correcting three forward. Three forward. Easy, easy. ",Classic
121205, So he's left bald patches on the planets he's visited? ,Classic

144911, What have you got in this? ,Classic
70630," These are your crop records, I take it? ",Classic
12763, Good man. Come on. ,Classic
28913," Oh, talk on the train, child. ",Classic
35144," It's quite a small unit. We're not equipped to deal with a full scale epidemic, you understand. Do you think you can manage? ",Classic
12682, Ready? ,Classic
95423," Oh yes, I know that. It's just not hearing anything.   Any news? ",Classic
90744, You want me to get you a visitor's pass. ,Classic
54857," Class three one nine six in the first grade. The names of the first selected candidates are, male, Abu-Gond! The second name is female. Vana-Gond! ",Classic
95300, Soon we shall revert to our normal form. ,Classic
123795, What? ,Classic
143034," A geological feature, perhaps. Something beneath the surface it might be dangerous to disturb. ",Classic
88917, He came down here and made a speech. Said we should all cooperate. ,Classic
9354, It's locked!,Classic
63194, Either I come with you or I go straight to the Brigadier. ,Classic
158116, Home. The wife. ,Classic
120523," Liar! The Creature can't talk without.   Guardmaster, take a look! ",Classic
84561," Well, it's quite simple, Jo. We're putting some of the green cells from the maggot's trail with some human body cells. ",Classic
31611, I'm sure you can't. ,Classic
26399," Why should I lie, Mister Clanton? I just want to stop you boys gettin' up against the law over nothin'. ",Classic
52923, No. ,Classic
91089, I do hope you'll include us in your article. We've been sadly misrepresented. ,Classic
75163," Very good, sir. ",Classic
11581," Destroyed? Well I never. Oh, when I went it was beautiful. There was the moving pavements, and the shops, and the astronaut fair I went to and it was in the Chelsea heliport. ",Classic
161841, More? ,Classic
89310, I still need you for a hostage. Come on. ,Classic
97870," We wait. They've got to come out sometime, so we wait. Then we follow, and when he's alone. But not until then, do you understand? ",Classic
95950, But that's way over safety margins. ,Classic
51221," Yes, now you mention it. ",Classic
21031, That is taranium. ,Classic
120562," Shush. Lady Adrasta, they've been gone a long time. ",Classic
165917," Who knows? Where to now, Ace? ",Classic
136105," Tegan, now you must leave your garden. ",Classic
143916," I've told you, I'm from Earth. ",Classic
18932," Look, I told you before. The Doctor's the one who will tell you what you want to know.   May I ask a question also? ",Classic
74461, His ignorance of the law at least deserves consideration. ,Classic
83496, We did it! ,Classic
115496, Indeed he is. It would be as well if you stayed here. I fear he will be in need of the funeral rites very soon after the wedding. ,Classic
147230," Oh, I'm with you, Mister Lytton. ",Classic
37590, Perhaps the Director himself. ,Classic
23992," Oh please, child. ",Classic
82491, How do you know it was the Doctor? ,Classic
71407," Thank you. Right, I will now hear the statement from IMC. Captain Dent, please?",Classic
127260, Turn off your instrument. ,Classic
147894, So you said. And so are we. ,Classic
75981, Thank you. ,Classic
129153," Please, I insist I do my small part. ",Classic
91407," No! Don't hurt him. Let him go. He's not important enough.   Don't shoot. Just leave now. Don't worry about me, just go. ",Classic
101300," So you think there is a real danger, Castellan? ",Classic
21788," It's a pity I blacked out. I mean, if I knew the ratio readings, we could use the same force again to protect us from the Daleks. ",Classic
134642," I think so. There was an explosion. Oh, my head aches. ",Classic
74983," Oh, that's marvellous, innit. Just marvellous. ",Classic
147586," On our home planet, Telos. ",Classic
159577, Will this one be friendly? ,Classic
119823, But they'll find out. They'll x-ray it. ,Classic
18664, How long will it take? ,Classic
16648, It is approaching the planet Mechanus. ,Classic
146149," Yes, Edgeworth. ",Classic
816," It's the only way I can answer you, young man. Now. Now we shall see.   It could be anywhere. Dear, dear, dear, dear. It's no help to us at all. Well, I suggest before we go outside and explore, let us clean ourselves up. ",Classic
125959," Rescue me. Tarak got killed, you got caught, and the Doctor's safely out of it. He can clear off in the Tardis whenever he likes. ",Classic
1026," Yes, indeed. At first light, then? ",Classic
116700, Have you been able to contact the Zeons? ,Classic
70862, Does it matter? ,Classic
25665, Why didn't he make the others do it? ,Classic
99817, But I thought you said just now we were in the fifteenth? ,Classic
141574, Silurian? ,Classic
66618, I will not listen to treason! ,Classic
48435, But we'll never get of the rig without it. ,Classic
73510, Get alternative orders. ,Classic
107057, And that is? ,Classic
154900," My submission concerns a crisis which threatens the lives not only of a group of people confined together with no means of escape, but would, if unresolved, threaten every mortal being on the planet Earth. ",Classic
82263, But ,Classic
100031," Doctor, give me a hand. ",Classic
94302, Try to get a contact. ,Classic
38928, Never mind. ,Classic
153757," Merdeen, you're a pal. Oh, you're both pals. Now show me.",Classic
26935," Oh, yes, I see. Well, I am expected. Do you know who I am? ",Classic
42546," Mmm. Well, that someone isn't going to be you. ",Classic
113665," Well, here we are. Yes. What do you think? Fascinating, eh? ",Classic
127910, The box has gone. ,Classic
28546," After what happened to Dodo, my dear sir, we should never have let those youngsters out of our sight.   That might be Ben now. ",Classic
27397," I shall be honoured to show you my laboratory when I have the time. Well, where is the savage for transference? ",Classic
125346, You just stay here and get back to your sums and I'll go and find them. ,Classic
160933, It's not a recording. I'm broadcasting live. Put down your gun and release Daisy K. ,Classic
3262," No, send him to me. Please. ",Classic
157476," Pex, can I ask you something? ",Classic
106999, He came armed and silent. ,Classic
73385," Let him go. Now then, turn off that machine.",Classic

30210, There's another planet out there! ,Classic
149006, I thought that last mad scheme of yours had finished you for good. ,Classic
3670," Yes, he said he'd never been there before. ",Classic
37598," Hey, what's that? ",Classic
92545, Is it? Ow. ,Classic
136842, It could become infected. How did it happen? Why didn't you tell me? ,Classic
113783, No. ,Classic
62797," Listen! Shall I take a look, sir? ",Classic
59043," Well, he's bound to bring Caven and the guards back. ",Classic
126151," Yes, well that might help. ",Classic
110909," He called himself Doctor for many lifespans before he became President, but I have never trusted him. When your good friends the Vardans ",Classic
115090," Never rush your pleasures, my dear Reynart. Besides, I've brought someone to see you. Meet his Royal Highness, Prince Reynart, first in line to the throne of Tara. ",Classic
28361," No, that's the strange thing. Now these are two of the best men in England and I haven't been able to get in touch with them. No one appears to have seen them since last night. Now isn't it an extraordinary thing that two such well known men can vanish so suddenly. ",Classic
164757, I think it's about time we had a proper look at those inscriptions.,Classic
152827, You're absolutely right. We must find out what's going on here.,Classic
24148, Yes. ,Classic
1096, We're not leaving until we've found Barbara. ,Classic
66917," That's it. I only hope it works. Shall we go, Mister Sutton? ",Classic
20207, Troilus? ,Classic
118386, Standard interrogation complete. Report analysis of responses. ,Classic
42217," I'm sorry, I can't hear you. There seems to some interference. ",Classic
89011," Your miners can withstand heat, but they cannot live without air. Eckersley, you will go to the refinery at once and you will turn the ventilation system off. ",Classic
105982, That? Are you suggesting I convert the carbon arc beam? ,Classic
163830, What theories? ,Classic
135164, Are you really going to sleep like that? ,Classic
161114," It will circle ever closer until finally it once again strikes the Earth at the point from which it originally departed, the meadow outside. ",Classic
32575, Exterminate! Ah! Ah! Exterminate!   Out of control! Out of Control! ,Classic
3767, Bandits? ,Classic
100604," No, there's nothing more to say because Eldrad must live. ",Classic
49859," No, not yet. There are still some crew members without. ",Classic
64703, The lift-off rate would crush the astronaut. ,Classic
25136," Well, you never asked, me dear. ",Classic
35915," Oh, you will eat later. Here we revive the weary body. ",Classic
135612," Yes, I'm a friend of the Doctor's. ",Classic
34574," Jamie, quickly, we've got to go and warn the Doctor. ",Classic
40565, You still think you can bargain with the Cybermen? ,Classic
18952, That's right. ,Classic
73867, Release him.,Classic
31057," No, I don't know, child. It is an unknown power. ",Classic
94529," I'm sorry, Doctor. I'm a bit whacked. ",Classic
75334, I've got him under lock and key. ,Classic
55266," Oh, but I'm not a Gond! ",Classic
64138, But will you confirm that all radio contact has been lost with the recovery capsule? ,Classic
126029, What's happening? ,Classic
103353," Oh, thanks. I'd never have thought of that. ",Classic
94073, This? This is the seventy ninth day. ,Classic
96483, Where are we going? ,Classic
123642, Doctor. ,Classic
102511, Particle analysis? ,Classic
22028," And then I will come to you on my camel, and sweep you away across the desert. ",Classic
114232, Pow? ,Classic
60802," It's no good, Russell. We must get away from here.",Classic
105654, What? ,Classic
77204," Come on, Stubbsy. Stubbsy, man? ",Classic
132250, The Empire of Traken. ,Classic
46877, Piccadilly? ,Classic
1628, They're walking into an ambush. ,Classic
85142," Brigadier, if I'm not out of there by three minutes to four, you and the rest of your clod-hopping friends can come in ",Classic
132558," Go and find Charles, my dear. ",Classic
40485, Release the cyber mats. We will use the power of cybernetics.   Activate them. The brain of this humanoid will be their target. Now.   These Cybermats are dormant through lack of use. Inspect them. ,Classic
991, The scanner. ,Classic
78795, But surely you would want to ,Classic
114678, No! The Professor must have let it through. ,Classic
84628," I would advise you not to come back here. If you should be so foolish, you would be received with considerably less courtesy.   And now, Mister Yates, we must make sure you are well looked after during your little stay. Elgin? Show Mister Yates to the visitor's suite, will you? ",Classic
13374," Now, my young man. If this is your idea of revenge for that tie then I think it's a pretty poor effort. ",Classic
38242," Oh yes, Inspector. ",Classic
148262, What is it? ,Classic
109726, More power! ,Classic
132282," Drink it, old boy.   Ah, Ann, my dear. Come and meet the hero of the day, and. ",Classic
127546," Yes, Keeper. The Consuls are confined to their quarters and the residential wing is sealed off. ",Classic
97655, It's intolerable. I won't stand for any more of it. ,Classic
43012," Oh, oh my head.   What are you doing to me? ",Classic
51755," Yes it's. Well, that's funny. There's no reading at all. ",Classic
49418," I didn't dream it, did I? Oh, what's the use of talking. Rudkin's dead. I'd give anything to. Oh, what's the use of talking.",Classic
116526, I'm only asking what must be on all minds. ,Classic
45673," Yes, Staff. ",Classic
43908,"   Must be the way you look, Jamie. ",Classic
102562," Yes, master. ",Classic
63700," I'm being as quick as I can, sir. ",Classic
119870, I was never in distress. ,Classic
74714," Oh, Centauri, stop it. ",Classic
27137, But Doctor. ,Classic
152754, Hey! Don't I get some? ,Classic
5524, Still in the place where it was hidden by the murderer Chesterton. ,Classic
143628, Good luck. ,Classic
44934," Ah, so they're here, are they? ",Classic
51319," Well the Quarks use ultrasound, so presumably it must be a fuel capable of producing a high enough energy quotient to sustain an amplifying complex of considerably sophisticated design. ",Classic
31147," I don't know. When the lights went out, he just seemed to faint.",Classic
44673, Never mind. I just don't like mysteries. Salamander's far too important to lock himself away like this. Anything might happen. A world emergency. Suppose I had to order you to let me in there? ,Classic
16497," I don't know. Ideal place to fight Daleks, you know. Good stout walls, an upper storey, stairs. Daleks don't like stairs. ",Classic
21312, Is your Special Force dealing with Bret Vyon? ,Classic
91201," I don't know exactly what it is, just the kind of thing it has to be. Well, am I right? ",Classic
121551," Mandrel. Doctor, they're called mandrels. ",Classic
155235, Whether his job is to keep unwanted visitors out or ,Classic
19629," Oh Doctor, don't say you're catching a cold now. ",Classic
54604," All right Sergeant, I know. Countdown to begin T minus forty five seconds. ",Classic
148677, She could be anywhere. ,Classic
36217," Well, it's just possible that you've been given a series of orders while you've been asleep. You know, do this, do that, do the other thing. My advice to you is don't do anything of the sort. Don't just be obedient. Always make up your own mind. What am I thinking of? Ben and Jamie! ",Classic
77276, Now deceased? ,Classic
71137, IMC control room.,Classic
152342, You are our prisoner. ,Classic
157748," Not that I would wish to bribe you to hold your tongue in anyway but rules can be made flexible, and it could be arranged for you to move into this flat instead of your own. It is substantially larger. And after all, what's the good of panicking people when I repeat everything is under control. ",Classic
12499, Lets get them back to the camp. ,Classic
42502, Were there others with you? ,Classic
68040," He's right you know, Doctor. I'd better come with you. ",Classic
90039, Wait! There is a stranger here. Guards!,Classic
113192, What's this place? ,Classic
100060," Listen, listen. Listen, there are other considerations besides your uncle and his petty ambitions. ",Classic
15037," Oh? I've always associated extinction with extreme cold. You know, something like the dark side of the moon. Haven't you? ",Classic
131428," You have little choice. You either trust me or give yourselves up to your pursuers, who would probably cudgel you to death.   I don't think they will bother us again. If the lad can walk, my camp is this way. ",Classic
45068, Redhead? Is that your wife? ,Classic
86978, We ought to dispose of him. ,Classic
79927," It is not true. I am Omega, creator of this world! And I can also destroy! Therefore I must exist! ",Classic
50534, Stop it. ,Classic
11120," Tyler, would you consider hanging on here for a short while longer? Just a few days. ",Classic
151448, See that you continue to serve me with the same degree of fidelity. ,Classic
39052, Dispose of the body. Obey! ,Classic
136307, Yes. ,Classic
62228, It was the man who led the raid on the hospital. I recognised him from his photograph. ,Classic
141166, I do. ,Classic
82543," Hello, Jo. ",Classic
53591," When they're safely tucked away, we'll flush out our clever Doctor.",Classic
40779," Hey, now would you look at this. Oh, that's marvellous. What. Hey, what's that? ",Classic
95084," Hey, he's coming round. ",Classic
30893, What's the matter with those range computers? ,Classic
73566," No, it's too late. ",Classic
7488, But you're asking us to trust you. ,Classic
32235, Call him. Get him back here as quickly as possible. We're all in terrible danger! The Examiner was right! Right all the time!   Don't listen to anything she has to say. ,Classic
158607," Kane has paid seventeen crowns for each of you, and he insists on value for money. ",Classic
94380," That was his doing. He beamed his two friends down to Voga. I tried to put the transmat out of action, but he managed to fix it somehow. ",Classic
103045, What's all this for? ,Classic
127336," I cannot accept payment. The honour of the Traken Union is at stake. There is a limit to the power of money, Lady Nyssa. ",Classic
109859, Gallifrey. ,Classic
62741, Right. We'll be ready to go in five minutes. ,Classic
78649," Brothers, silence! Peace! Peace, I say. I shall speak plainly too. You ask for the blessings of the golden years. Yet there came a time when Atlantis grew to hate them. What would you have, Hippias? If you were master of Kronos, lord of time. Ten crops in one season? A surfeit of fishes? An ocean of wine? Then take the barren soil as well, the stinking piles of rotting meat, an idle drunken people. I tell you Kronos was a curse! ",Classic
108460, K-keep your hands wh-where we can see them. ,Classic
77512, Mmm? ,Classic
82026," All right.   Well, this one's empty. ",Classic
36285," You're coming with me, girl. You broke the Colony law.   What's the matter with you? ",Classic
155541," Well, the pulveriser, but why ",Classic
23578, We will give away nothing of our land. ,Classic
155573, I didn't do that! ,Classic
94559," Doctor, we've got about nine minutes. ",Classic
153972, Who else is there? ,Classic
155885, The Key of Rassilon never leaves my possession. ,Classic
28528, I'm very well. I am happy to work for the success of the Machines. ,Classic
51217, Perhaps it is. ,Classic
140307," He's a machine, Doctor, just a machine. How can we be certain he still isn't under the control of the Master? ",Classic
963,   J62. ,Classic
111805, The key. ,Classic
127057, In the courtyard. ,Classic
69754, Check. ,Classic
18575, We cannot escape. ,Classic
115917," Look, sucker marks. Pretty ancient, too, by the way the erosion's ",Classic
101900," If you undo that, you'll die as surely as any of us. ",Classic
144061, Superior? It took you long enough to ensnare the Tardis in the Time Corridor. ,Classic
63602," No, that's not ",Classic
28308," I was just about to pay you, my man. Have you got change of a quid? ",Classic
155401, No. ,Classic
157282, The Kangs. The Red Kangs. ,Classic
56558, Well I can assure you it's not impossible. What is your emergency? What's happening on Moonbase? ,Classic
43726," Now let's have a look at it. You're not, and please don't argue. Victoria? Bring some warm water will you? ",Classic
139795, You assisted in bringing the ship to harbour. ,Classic
44604, All right. ,Classic
126719, It's a matter of complete indifference to me. ,Classic
46358," Yes. And we're the flies, all right, but where is the spider? ",Classic
83754, It's the pit! ,Classic
88478, I warned you I did not fully understand the control mechanism. ,Classic
5383, Several people saw him only two days ago. ,Classic
141217, Watch.   Temporal fission. Old Rassilon is very clever. ,Classic
11909," Now don't worry. We'll be there. Try to hold on just a bit longer. We'll contact you for directions in seventeen hours from now. Repeat, seventeen hours. Breaking contact now. ",Classic
129217," But Doctor, it's ",Classic
120292," Yes, my lady. One moment. ",Classic
83580, Dalek command has identified the leading alien. The one who is not a Thal. ,Classic
149335," Shouldn't think he were too well pleased. Happen I should have gone meself, explained. In t'office, is he? ",Classic
148344, You find a way back to the Tardis and then the Doctor'll be delighted to demonstrate. ,Classic
92443," I am the swarm leader. I guarantee your safety. The Wirrn will spare your lives, but leave the sleepers for us!",Classic
89866, Say please. ,Classic
26916, I won't go far.   Dodo! What's happened? ,Classic
42775, Commence. ,Classic
45468, What's the matter? ,Classic
107179, I did. Do you understand? I did. ,Classic
94833, What an absurd idea. ,Classic
7293, Go on. Don't worry about me. Go on. ,Classic
72047," Would you like to explain that reference, Professor? ",Classic
40136," I beg your pardon? Did I hear you right? You are paid to take orders, Captain Hopper. ",Classic
93304, You'll be all right. Can you stand up? ,Classic
86879," I told you, to New Earth. ",Classic
108328, You mean take over Main Control? ,Classic
867," Yes, it's certainly alien to anything on your planet. But you're wrong about one thing, Chesterfield. This isn't like everything else. The animal is solidified, certainly, but it's not crumbly stone. It's metal. Yes, it always was. ",Classic
160493, I know that song. ,Classic
77639," Molecular structure stable. Increasing power. Two oh, two five, three oh.",Classic
117005, Have them picked up. ,Classic
47079," But the press conference, Doctor. ",Classic
96333," Mummies are embalmed, eviscerated corpses. They don't walk. ",Classic
18440," It is better that you don't. Besides, we cannot come out. In order to live we must have ammoniac gas. So we live in here in a compartment where it is filtered in. ",Classic
68650," My dear Lethbridge Stewart, your word is my command. You know that you only have to ask. ",Classic
143156, We must get help. ,Classic
73008, To do thy will shall be the whole of the law. ,Classic
97298," So, everything we've seen has been a fake. ",Classic
3838," Good luck, Ian. ",Classic
88496," Yes, well, that's really done it. With modern weapons in their hands, there's no end to the damage these lunatics can do. ",Classic
2799," Hold that. Yes, just a minute now. Yes, there you are, you see?",Classic
138579, But will there still be enough time? ,Classic
23472," There's a draught in here. Close those shutters.   Between you, you will find the Abbot and you will give him this message for me. Say the decision has been made. ",Classic
157872," Search hard, my Cleaners, search hard. Bring them all out! All the nasty human beings! The Caretakers, the Residents, the Kangs, all of them! We'll be back to collect the rubbish later.",Classic
26818, They may as well be if they win this way. Masterson'll see they hang for it. ,Classic
81043, One wonders why the tribunal is submitting to questioning by this creature. Shouldn't it be the other way round? ,Classic
31304, Surely it doesn't apply to me? ,Classic
52930, One moment. Party not available. ,Classic
155478," I didn't. See him, that is. He was in the shower. I spoke to him through the door.   Where can he have got to? With all these killings ",Classic
75394," Excuse me, sir. ",Classic
111157," We will do battle on your own ground, Doctor. ",Classic
6116, For what reason? ,Classic
26488, I've got business of my own to settle first. Personal business with Doc Holliday. ,Classic
123496, You might at least try Hardin's idea. ,Classic
15099, They were talking. ,Classic
162145," Look, we're not leaving, if that's what you mean. ",Classic
101268," Coyned. He's got into the tower. You'll have to check every floor.   All guards report to main tower, sector seven. Dangerous intruder at large. ",Classic
34469," What man, sir? ",Classic
28189," Yes, very odd, very odd indeed. Perhaps he's overworking. Who was that little man, Krimpton? ",Classic
93321, They must. They must! ,Classic
105368, I wouldn't try to find out. Tain't wise. ,Classic
62440," My goodness, no. Don't you realise that when I was stranded on this little planet of yours, I had nothing but these clothes that IOh, my goodness! ",Classic
108924, Affirmative. ,Classic
32360, Are you all right? ,Classic
100742," I can't see anything yet, sir. ",Classic
22522, Doctor! It's hopeless. ,Classic
12502, Just another dreary old statue. ,Classic
60837," We're all sorts here, lad. ",Classic
51530, But that will create a volcano. And if they explode the atomic seed device in the middle of that ,Classic
160509," Yes, I have heard rumours. ",Classic
16289, Obliterate! ,Classic
100521, What's happened to the electron charge? ,Classic
23747, What do you mean? ,Classic
112664, Really? That's a very interesting observation. ,Classic
69704, Who? ,Classic
158010, Both. ,Classic
138445," I can't, I'm not strong enough. ",Classic
51898, I don't know. Perhaps there wasn't one. Perhaps it was just illusion. ,Classic
429, Let the old man die. And we'll watch the great Kal as he kills his strong enemy. ,Classic
5664," Oh, yes, they've owned up to everything. Kala and the Prosecutor had planned to steal the key and sell it, and Chesterton here just happened to walk right into the middle of it. They made him look so guilty I never doubted for a moment he was the one. ",Classic
33272," Silence there, you bilge rats! And quiet! Pipe down there. Quiet. The Solicitor hath news for ye. ",Classic
91166," Yes. Then Miss Winters and Jellicoe came along while I was waiting for the Doctor. They programmed the robot to kill him. I protested, but ",Classic
21752, Well it appears that everything's going according to plan. ,Classic
113457, You can never relax for a moment in this job. ,Classic
34744, What of Lolem the priest? ,Classic
128687," Farewell, my friends. Farewell forever!   ",Classic
121310," Well, it rings a bell. ",Classic
100477, I think the answer might lie in the quarry. ,Classic
150316, All it did was to produce a few hiccups in the time continuum. Enough to tell us that dangerously crude experiments were going on. ,Classic
70683, Maybe I can drive it off. ,Classic
4985, Barbara's disappeared. That idol thing was on some sort of a pivot. ,Classic
122789, The way is blocked? ,Classic
122703," Doctor, there's someone coming. ",Classic
71506," All right, Norton. Get up there. ",Classic
29147, He's been kidnapped. You've got to save him. ,Classic
26238," Well, why don't you stop 'em then? ",Classic
86906, There's also a lot of love and kindness and honesty. You've got a warped view of things. ,Classic
97048, I see. Then they are externals. ,Classic
127691, Oh. ,Classic
151015, I suggest you think about your own wife. ,Classic
69110," I think so, yes. How would you like a free pardon, unlimited money and a ticket to anywhere in the world? ",Classic
28306, Ta ta then. ,Classic
123484, Doctor! ,Classic
6875," Try the scanner, Doctor. ",Classic
145912, Oxygen. No time. I must find Peri. ,Classic
34135," By Christopher, you're right. If we disappear now they'll think we're gone to the project work gang. Okay, Jacko? ",Classic
160987," Really, Doctor? Thank you for reminding me. ",Classic
33561, Aren't you forgetting one thing? ,Classic
139899," All I care about is getting back to the Tardis, where it's nice and warm. No wonder they forced him to sign Magna Carta. Bet there was something in it about underheated housing. ",Classic
16748," Barbara? Barbara, we've found her. Barbara? Where is she? ",Classic
64259, Go and see Doctor Taltalian. That's his department. ,Classic
151330, Impossible. ,Classic
121230, It's inexplicable. We'd better put it back. ,Classic
91230, Couldn't we lock them up? ,Classic
136744, You're forgetting Tegan. ,Classic
141646," Now kill her, Maddox. ",Classic
125996, Doctor. ,Classic
110542, Try me! ,Classic
50313," No, no, no, of course not. There's nothing unpleasant on Dulkis. ",Classic
55577, Yes. ,Classic
7593, XC four. What part of the body do you want the beam to strike? ,Classic
134439, What are you talking about? ,Classic
52961," Yes, sir. Come on. This way.",Classic
95554, Hmm? What did you say? ,Classic
129282," Well, whoever I feel like, it's absolutely splendid. Let's go. ",Classic
76338, Sir? ,Classic
157250," Sorry about the pool, Mel. ",Classic
60145," Oh yes, I see. Yes, that's fascinating. ",Classic
39942," Oh really, Doctor? And may we know what that is? ",Classic
147820, That thing. What does it do? ,Classic
73790, Ten?,Classic
87246, Thank you. ,Classic
112674," Affirmative, master. Friend. ",Classic
164894, Yes. ,Classic
131816, And the sooner they're dispatched the better. ,Classic
59495," Now look, just you listen to me a moment. ",Classic
19237, I don't know. It depends on how long ago it was. ,Classic
120853," Yeah, I still say we should have picked up that shell. ",Classic
60963, Who is this? ,Classic
136568, What? ,Classic
136102," I'm in my garden, silly. Everything grows in my garden. People always come back. I close my eyes, I want them to come back and they do. It always works. I can tell lies too. People don't always notice so I'm safe here. ",Classic
25903, Well if I was you I'd keep a-travellin'. There ain't no theatre in Tombstone. ,Classic
6648, Ian! ,Classic
119866," Yes, yes. Such a bore. ",Classic
86807, I'm not telling anyone about it until I can get some evidence. ,Classic
74669," The men are armed and ready, sir. ",Classic
121279, Was it anything to do with the machine? ,Classic
121011," Good. No, Romana, you stay here. I might need you. I'll take K9. K9? K9? ",Classic
82763, Why should I? You come here out of nowhere and then claim to be something out of a legend. ,Classic
54720," Sir, Captain Turner reports Russian missile on it's way. ",Classic
21288," I think that takes care of that. You know, Karlton, some of your agents are getting too good. We don't want to spoil things for ourselves at this stage. ",Classic
32682, Abide a moment! Do you wish to pray before you die? ,Classic
84690, What then? ,Classic
47502, Right. ,Classic
59126," I just have. Hold on a second, Dom. We're on our way!",Classic
36572, Does that mean he's been caught? ,Classic
161681, We ride to destiny. ,Classic
89555, Oh. Excuse me.,Classic
33725, What about Jamie? We can't leave him here. ,Classic
16175," Yes, I suspected something of that kind might happen. What is it? ",Classic
107484," Come on, let's get out of here. ",Classic
54199," No? Dangerous is it? Fear, Watkins. Do you know what fear is? ",Classic
116370," I mean, are you sure it's firm? ",Classic
114937, Where does George come into all this? ,Classic
149552," Doctor, they're heading towards the dell. ",Classic
34569, Polly? ,Classic
93464, Exterminate! Exterminate! ,Classic
41187, What is it? What do you want? ,Classic
100640, Eldrad must live. ,Classic
17799, Is he coming out yet? ,Classic
12831," Anyway, I wanted to have a word with you, Maximus. But it can wait, Maximus, it can wait. ",Classic
66825," Right, off you go! ",Classic
66710, Why not? ,Classic
18010," Yes, I think I'm beginning to understand. ",Classic
87183, Leave her to me. ,Classic
97799, Or a telekinetic visit. ,Classic
80063, I'd sooner Miss Grant. ,Classic
134258, At least you're here. How did the Russians let you land? ,Classic
124861, Really? Why would you do a thing like that? ,Classic
149677, He is from the planet Earth. A human. ,Classic
145485, What kind of disaster? ,Classic
23674," Nicholas! Quickly, it's the Admiral. ",Classic
121249," If there's any Vraxoin on board, it'll show up on the scan. ",Classic
54043," Yes, sir. ",Classic
67345," Well, I'm not sorry to hear that. What about the nuclear reactor? ",Classic
111225, I believe I begin to understand the Doctor. ,Classic
67761, The Nestene Autons will run the factory. ,Classic
108008," I've grounds for believing, your Eminence, that there is a conspiracy among dissident Ajacks to foment armed rebellion against the Company, glory be to the Company. ",Classic
30920," I can't fire this rocket, and neither can you. ",Classic
147130," Not yet, you don't. I wonder why I didn't do it before. ",Classic
104967," Well, surely there must be something we can do for them? ",Classic
145446," Hey, cut it out, Stotzy. ",Classic
94474, Very well. ,Classic
48148," Well, what are we going to do? ",Classic
75150, How very ingenious. ,Classic
137817, Look at them out there. I'll bet they knew this was going to happen. ,Classic
127370," Doctor, the ion bonder. ",Classic
43841," You could walk into Salamander's Research Station at Kanowa, find out how he's getting control of the separate World Zones and then bring out absolute proof.   Yes. I see. How long did you say it would take you to master Salamander's accent? ",Classic
102193," That was an armoured space glove, or what was left of one. ",Classic
79825, Contact. ,Classic
50347, Dummies? Did you check?  ,Classic
100207, Would you explain to your peers that your accession cannot be celebrated because of a pagan uprising? ,Classic
52696, What is it? ,Classic
58630," No joke, girl. Now look, will you do one thing for me before you start asking me any fool questions? ",Classic
112030," Don't bother, I heard you the first time. ",Classic
59593," Oh, you don't really believe that? ",Classic
126870, So what becomes of this Melkur? ,Classic
145829," In the absence of the President, I am myself flying off immediately to Androzani Minor on a peace mission. ",Classic
41588," And in his wisdom our Master, Padmasambhava, has given me his guidance. We must all leave the monastery. It is impossible for us to defeat the Yeti. ",Classic
102086," Yes, well, look, if you'll just untie my hands, I think I have an idea of what's going on. I may be able to help. ",Classic
130289, Are the Kinda dangerous? ,Classic
108769," Our conference has gone on too long, Doctor. It is time to implement contingency plan A.   This switch controls the sprinkler valves throughout the City. ",Classic
150563," Yes, sir? ",Classic
161600, Take the bow from him. ,Classic
41115, What's he seen? ,Classic
107838," Your Honour, it's inconceivable. To flout so many regulations. ",Classic
32687," Doctor, tell them who we are. ",Classic
53656," Keep the guards out. Quick, bring the filing cabinet. Push. ",Classic
18513, Normal. ,Classic
110108," Believe me, Lord Borusa, I've never been more serious in any of my lives. While Leela remains free in the Citadel, we are in danger. ",Classic
94847," I think I'd better take a look at these, sir. ",Classic
18259, You're trying to be too clever.   You have done badly. You will be punished. This is a prisoner. You must not talk to him. ,Classic
34424," Well, we'll have a go, Doctor, but it'll take a great gift of the gab to win over the fish people, you know? ",Classic
109368, My father did. ,Classic
44111, What? ,Classic
109569, Surrender? ,Classic
136642, And another three steps. That's it. Now forwards. Wait there. ,Classic
141412," But I can't do that, not without authority from Sea Base Command. ",Classic
59662," Well, it's like a telephone, only you can see people as well as hear them. ",Classic
4869, Yes. Sabetha wanted to continue the search with us. ,Classic
122603," Each of you shall command your own fleet and I, Soldeed, shall lead you into battle. ",Classic
44288, Why should he do that? ,Classic
154666, He'll be there. Though whose body he'll inhabit isn't as yet certain. We must transfer Kiv's brain to someone else without delay. ,Classic
131923, Terileptian law was never my strong point. ,Classic
162020," So I've been told. Personally, I just keep on wandering. ",Classic
94071, He's as tough as an old boot. ,Classic
138917, What? ,Classic
117785," Yeah. We was on the tech course together. Long time ago now, Theet, eh? Must be what, four hundred and fifty years? And a long way from Gallifrey. ",Classic
20197," Oh, look, be fair. How was I to know that you'd manage to get round King Priam? ",Classic
97291," If I'd had my wits around me, I'd have known it from the start. Remember that high level of radiation I'd noticed when we left the Tardis? ",Classic
59836," Well, perhaps the Doctor will be able to talk them into letting us go. ",Classic
100628, It is the law. Eldrad must live. ,Classic
143599, The battle cruiser has attacked the fighters. ,Classic
117991," I think so, yes. ",Classic
122314, Seth is going to destroy the Nimon and take us home in triumph! His father's keeping a lookout so that he can have a welcome party ready. ,Classic
134532, How you love the company of fools. ,Classic
91330, And knock out anything we send against it. ,Classic
109190," Two of you, after him!   Heresy! Treachery! Incitement to escape. ",Classic
152139," Even with Davros dead, he's not without his followers. And like the disciples of any fanatic, they will not give up without a struggle. As you can see, the box has a series of buttons. I will give you a simple five digit sequence which will activate the transmitter. This you must do the moment you enter Davros' laboratory. The moment you strike the final button, a prerecorded signal will be transmitted. I will then mobilise my forces to eliminate Davros' agents here and to take over his entire base. ",Classic
144152, I shouldn't have left them. ,Classic
6501, Drink it.   So this is your friendship.   You defile this temple. Get out of my sight. Go! ,Classic
60535," Are you sure you can work these controls, Doctor? ",Classic
49147," Bill, any ideas? ",Classic
95976, Activate secondary boosters. ,Classic
59846, I realise this must seem rather strange.  LÜ ,Classic
55658, The gravitation feed is dropping. ,Classic
164744, Don't you feel the cold? It's like winter. It's most unsuitable for an invalid. ,Classic
126797, Yes. One solid hope's worth a cartload of certainties. ,Classic
13649, And now you're ready to attack? ,Classic
101921," Well, I didn't actually see him fall, you know. I was quite busy. ",Classic
26769, Steven? What in the world? ,Classic
56049," Doctor, if we've landed, where are we? ",Classic
35042, What's that? ,Classic
127051," Yes, and so I see are you. Tremas, isn't it? Been investigating high energy forcefields, eh? ",Classic
120377," You and you, come with me. ",Classic
151748, Doctor. ,Classic
3335," All right, Grandfather. ",Classic
67378," May I remind you, Miss Shaw, that you're still a serving member of UNIT? I don't entirely care for your tone. ",Classic
123060," Morix! Morix! Where is everyone? For goodness sake, get somebody! ",Classic
118868, Malfunction. ,Classic
36869, You will not be able to fight it. You cannot stop it. ,Classic
164382, I will not change. I'll wake up soon. No change. Dead. ,Classic
99875, Sire. ,Classic
81942, It contains all the elements to support life. ,Classic
9591," And these. They're yours, aren't they? Given in exchange for those rather splendid clothes and the insignia of a Regional Provincial Deputy. ",Classic
144847, Work? Where are the gifts? The Outsider always brings gifts from Logar. ,Classic
132304," Better make that orange juice for the children, Brewster. ",Classic
45072, What's all that about? ,Classic
71897," The point is that one must rule or serve. That's a basic law of life. Why do you hesitate, Doctor? Surely it's not loyalty to the Time Lords, who exiled you on one insignificant planet? ",Classic
141864, What's this? ,Classic
156449, I want all mirrors removed from the Tardis henceforth. ,Classic
104610," Not Chang. His master, the crazed maniac who organised all this. ",Classic
28440, Other means must be employed. Doctor Who is required. ,Classic
15531," But although we have sworn to drive the Moroks from Xeros, it will not be easy. The life they impose on us makes organisation difficult. ",Classic
58906, Satisfied? ,Classic
91984," No, no, he gave me an order. ",Classic
126728, Revivals. Break out the cargo. ,Classic
77235," Well, yes, I think so. ",Classic
151435," There you are, you see? I'm right. You have the perfect attitude. ",Classic
55603, Slings and fireballs will never reach the Krotons while they're still in that machine. ,Classic
118655, Don't you be so sure. ,Classic
8878," No, no, definitely a hidden treasure. ",Classic
107518, What about the others? We can't just leave them. ,Classic
55409," That the council requires my advice? On a matter of science, I presume. ",Classic
99007," What's the best way in, do you think? ",Classic
160896, How long is it since you were last on this planet? ,Classic
103086," For all we know, there may be more of them. ",Classic
164772, And it wasn't here this morning. ,Classic
160724, Nice pipes. Reminds me of Perivale. ,Classic
109219," Oh, he'll be all right. He's building up his strength. ",Classic
8147," No. There was something particularly odd about his clothes, I remember. Exactly what ",Classic
60910, He is my prisoner. ,Classic
102732, Now!   Come on. ,Classic
86721," Well, that's just it, you see. No one knows. ",Classic
138341," No. No, they were too fit. And they were armed. ",Classic
151692, Men. ,Classic
123280," Ah, so that's how it's done. ",Classic
164126, Redvers knew the relief column would arrive. ,Classic
71058," No power for machinery, no heat, no light. We're finished. ",Classic
158273," Oh, my head. ",Classic
135977," What job? Didn't I tell you? I got the sack. So you're stuck with me, aren't you. ",Classic
145595," You'll pay, Jek, because we took the risk to get them here on time. You'll pay because if you don't, we won't be doing business no more. Not so much as a single bullet. ",Classic
125337, Stowaway. One who hides in a ship to obtain free passage. ,Classic
156961," Well, of course",Classic
138936, And you're quite sure not one of you can remember coming aboard? ,Classic
57232, What's going on? Someone sending up a rocket? ,Classic
133676, What was that? ,Classic
41015," It is the Master, Padmasambhava. Do not be afraid. Answer him. ",Classic
108827, Apologies are not necessary. ,Classic
98524, Yes. ,Classic
76455, Does it? ,Classic
75412, I still don't see why you want to help them. What can you possibly gain? ,Classic
95808, Bring the prisoners forward. ,Classic
55454, They went into the machine. ,Classic
115813, You have eighty magazines with fifty rounds in each. Is there an army at the refinery? ,Classic
26709, You gonna try 'n to stop me? ,Classic
102756, Ow. I wish I hadn't. ,Classic
103444, With reason. Ow. ,Classic
112209, I flatter myself I know how to get the best from natives. ,Classic
64897, I'm coming with you.,Classic
92474, They're coming in through the reversion vents! ,Classic
88521," Do forgive me, old chap, but you've got it all wrong. ",Classic
5708, Of course not. Send him away. ,Classic
3154," Oh, a long way from here. I've never seen a moonlit night. How long before the moon rises? ",Classic
61670," Listen, Munro. I want an armed guard put on that police box at once. Nobody is to be allowed near it, do you understand? Nobody.",Classic
156391," She's perfectly safe, but how long she remains so depends on you.",Classic
104159, I've dabbled a bit. Dilettante. ,Classic
118794, Go out and check he's still in position. ,Classic
31049," No, and they can't spy on us either. Now this is what I think we should do.",Classic
138740, What is it? ,Classic
134888," Well, the brake line's fractured and we've lot a lot of fluid. ",Classic
110969," You're out of condition, Borusa, that's your problem. Do you think you can make it over there? ",Classic
4594," Yes, it was Susan. Come on! ",Classic
106493, Yes. Just stay here and hope we come back with the antidote. And Professor? ,Classic
117548, The Marshal. Shapp must have missed him. ,Classic
88284, What? ,Classic
1990, So we can go through? ,Classic
103336," What were you doing, then? Making doubly sure? ",Classic
65460," We'll be ready for your live telecast very soon, General. ",Classic
143770, Do you think the Daleks have anything to do with this? ,Classic
59292," Supply truck leaving for base now, sir. ",Classic
84962, Instructions? Who from? ,Classic
153173, I protest! ,Classic
26200," Now you'll stay right where you are. Why, you've got four of the meanest characters in the territory believing you're Doc Holliday.   You take one step outside of this jail, friend, and you're a dead man. ",Classic
55275, This is the most advanced machine. Perhaps he can't answer the questions. ,Classic
126450, Her mind's gone. She's dreaming. ,Classic
113281, Bring the manifest. ,Classic
76608, So what do we do? ,Classic
74441," We were once, but now we reject violence except in self-defence.",Classic
87754, That sounded awfully close. ,Classic
146284," Once you have revived them, put the proposition and let them proceed with the first concept. Whatever time remains to you on Titan Three, do not waste it. Drive them to the limit. ",Classic
15833," Not at all, my dear boy, anytime, anytime. ",Classic
87917, There's just one more thing. If I don't come back. ,Classic
78228," Master, do not compel me, I beseech you.",Classic
49319," Zoe, Doctor John Smith, isn't it? ",Classic
75804, You will negotiate a truce between my people and the humans. ,Classic
120444," I don't care if it's on fire. If it's metal, bring it. ",Classic
9443," No, no, no, this matter can't wait. It's urgent. I've just been interrogating that young woman, and I'm convinced she's a member of that dangerous Traitor's Party. ",Classic
145606, To find the queen bat. ,Classic
139304, Come on. We're taking Tegan back to the Tardis. ,Classic
141147, He's after the Ring of Rassilon. He wants immortality. ,Classic
6469, Because I overheard something that Tlotoxl said to Tonila. ,Classic
7712," From the first symptoms, no one has lived longer than the third day. ",Classic
10918, You wanted to see these. ,Classic
68935," A pleasure to see you again, Governor. ",Classic
38175, Director. Gatwick Control calling us again. ,Classic
91616," Ugh, I hate brandy. ",Classic
124101," Yes, and all because of these Deons. When the Doctor came in here, you're certain he was alone? ",Classic
127223, Shush. Can't it wait? ,Classic
80909," Look, how long do you think you've been on this ship? ",Classic
115683," Rohm-Dutt? He is involved in gun-running, isn't he. ",Classic
19409," That is, if they even suspect its presence before it goes off. ",Classic
137365, You have in your memory the information I need to track down the Tardis and communicate with Nyssa and Tegan. ,Classic
56612," Hello Moonbase. Yes, we can. We are coming in on your signal now. Whatever you do, keep transmitting. ",Classic
61291, The only people who can put an end to this whole ghastly business and send everyone back to their own times. The Time Lords. ,Classic
130778," Now? Now we can relax, enjoy ourselves. ",Classic
85824," Thank you, Sarah. ",Classic
64911, So there's no way of stopping them? ,Classic
120251," Yes, that's exactly what we're going to do. Get your weapons, my lovely boys. We're going visiting. ",Classic
61331, Remove the traitor's carcass. We will return to the home planet and bring back an army to quell this revolt once and for all. ,Classic
24772, I know. And it was empty when we opened the door. ,Classic
116078," Shouldn't we send for reinforcements, sir? A police unit? ",Classic
110023," Is there anyone here to contest the candidate's right to the Sash of Rassilon?   Is there anyone here to contest the candidate's right to the Rod of Rassilon?   Is there anyone here to contest the candidate's right to the Great Key of Rassilon?   By custom, with wisdom, and for honour, I shall strike three times. Should no voice be heard by the third stroke, I will, duty-bound, invest the candidate as President of the Supreme Council of the Time Lords of Gallifrey. ",Classic
42056," Come on, Thomni. ",Classic
19904, A monument to what? ,Classic
62401," I don't think so. You see, he was never really alive. ",Classic
60698," After some more of your mental processing, I suppose? ",Classic
125563, Be silent. ,Classic
61337," Well, I cannot stay here. Jamie, Zoe, this is where we say goodbye. ",Classic
62202," Very good, sir. ",Classic
108846, Yes. ,Classic
75841, Should be. ,Classic
126970, It looks almost alive. ,Classic
140926, It looks very much like a bell to me. ,Classic
142812," Hey, you're not allowed up there. ",Classic
105632, Shush. ,Classic
59502," Well, there must be some mistake. I mean, can I see your identification papers? ",Classic
161448," You're mad! Return without the Nemesis? Never. And without my knowledge, you cannot return at all. I tell you, Richard, either you assist me to regain it or I leave thee here forever. Now, come. I think they are peaceful. ",Classic
99439, Typical. Just like a bunch of women. ,Classic
36297, There is nothing evil or harmful in this colony. ,Classic
145550," Jek, your people fouled up, not ours. ",Classic
29130," The Squire's the law in these parts, cub. And guard your tongue when talking to your elders. ",Classic
57495," Oh, where are going now? ",Classic
47689," Oh, I don't know. ",Classic
102645, Who am I? ,Classic
128135, What are they for? ,Classic
75229," Doctor, I've been very patient with you, but if I thought ",Classic
122337, The great Civil War. Only the army survived. ,Classic
115851, We have calculated the methane production. We can satisfy the protein requirements of one fifth of Delta Magna. ,Classic
85837," Can you, can you just go anywhere you like in that Tardis? ",Classic
72339," Well, it'll have to wait. Come on, first things first. ",Classic
34230," Yeah, but where's Jamie? He went with you. ",Classic
29747," Well, I think if we are able to find that treasure first, we might be able to bargain. ",Classic
127880, Which vehicle? ,Classic
52415, It's an awful long way to climb. ,Classic
117068," Oh well, I'm very grateful for your confidence, Marshal. I'll see what I can manage. Er, we're not under arrest, then? ",Classic
146645, You're so blatantly transparent. ,Classic
55664, But the machine will come down first. Look at the vibration! ,Classic
3828," Then, I shall have to be more careful in future. ",Classic
77619, Extraordinary. I could have sworn I'd told you. It's a time sensor. ,Classic
1432, Yes. Remember what they did to your legs. ,Classic
44450," Of course there was someone, and there was shooting. ",Classic
76675, You'll hear them announce a power failure. That'll be your chance. ,Classic
13600," Menop pathfinder to leader one. Range to Vortis, one four oh. ",Classic
48867," Something happens to the crew. One of them puts on the automatic. The rocket's travelled so far now, the power feedback to automatic is probably failing. ",Classic
56530," Well, it's quite simple, Jamie. It's an automatic device. We send out code radio signals which triggers the homing beacon into action. We automatically lock onto it until we reach the point in orbit where we fire retro-rockets to land. ",Classic
61344," Now look, if you're going to be in trouble, you'll need me to look after you. ",Classic
155749, Doctor. Your tape.   Not that it'll do you much good. I've wiped it. ,Classic
52905," Oh, yes, you see, but this is very important. ",Classic
160165, Force leader has recovered the Hand of Omega. ,Classic
69014, I see. ,Classic
157962," Hello, there, Kroagnon. This is the Doctor speaking. I don't believe we've met, though no doubt you've heard of me. I thought so. Anyway, I'd heard so much about Paradise Towers I thought I'd come and take a look and, believe me, I'm very disappointed. It displays exactly what everyone says is your usual failure as an architect. Not making allowances for people. Still, I'm sure if we managed to work together, we might just about make this place habitable. I've a few ideas which I might give to you, if you can be bothered to listen. Bye for now.",Classic
150689, That's twelve servings. ,Classic
22417," Oh, yes, I would agree. ",Classic
125257," Yes. We won't know until we've seen the sights, met a few more people. ",Classic
26041, Yeah. ,Classic
118774, Yes. The Dalek fleet will be wiped from the heavens and nothing will stand in our way of the conquest of the galaxy. ,Classic
24726," There is still no contact from Two on Refusis, One. ",Classic
42005," I'll deal with him. But remember, as soon as we're in the sanctum, whatever happens, Thomni and you must smash the controls. ",Classic
112528," Can't be right. It is right. But it can't be, can it? ",Classic
91235, Stay where you are! My men have this building surrounded. ,Classic
33765," We don't know what's going to be waiting for us out there, do we? Come on, Doctor, open up. ",Classic
22652," Yes, even after all that. ",Classic
34762, He's right. Come on! ,Classic
42034, What shall we do? ,Classic
110130, We need a set of cypher indent keys. ,Classic
92123, What?   Carry on with that thoracic incision. Not too deep. ,Classic
125998," Stay calm, Doctor. ",Classic
22608, My men will soon destroy them! Come! ,Classic
84341," Fair enough, Jocelyn, but you are interrupting a cabinet meeting, you know. Who? Oh yes, the UNIT chap. Well, you'd better put him on. Do forgive me, Prime Minister. Ah, Brigadier. Unfortunate business, this.",Classic
98651, Sorry to be such a nuisance. ,Classic
91039, But the circuitry you built could be altered or tampered with. ,Classic
129050," Castrovalva, folding in on itself deliberately. ",Classic
123414," No, nothing except a sort of cabinet of illusions. And then the name of the thing. Has that struck you? ",Classic
112680," Pralix, what do the Mentiads want of you? What is it? ",Classic
75685, Ready to lower the observation chamber? ,Classic
54401," Yeah, but for how long? Now, can you honestly say that everything's going according to plan, that nothing's been overlooked? Well, can you? ",Classic
88222," I'm sure there has been a misunderstanding, your Majesty. I am prepared to vouch for the Doctor. ",Classic
105319, There's a light out there. ,Classic
51430, Oh. ,Classic
74654," Very well. I shall consider all you have said, and if you can assure me of your support, then I shall act.",Classic
64543," Then why wasn't I informed, sir? ",Classic
139255, Can you hear? I need your help. Can you hear me? ,Classic
23627," You must curb your impatience, young man. If you will tell me what your business is, then perhaps I can help you. ",Classic
26458, Real trouble? ,Classic
102529, They must be found and killed. This must take precedence over all other duties and devotions. ,Classic
37245, Yes? ,Classic
74569," No, Jo, keep back! ",Classic
115582, Shush! ,Classic
74632," Extremely unethical! Fortunately the scheme has been foiled, so all is well. ",Classic
139853," Makes a nice change for you not to take everything in your stride, I must say. ",Classic
146606," Well, shouldn't we go there? ",Classic
51333, Alien attack. ,Classic
160196, Will you return the Hand of Omega or not? ,Classic
112038," Bones, bones, shine in the darkness. Show what I seek. Shine with the ice light, shine with the corpse light. Bring to the circle the one whom I seek. If he be near me bring him before me. Bones of our fathers ",Classic
61509, All this is entirely irrelevant. ,Classic
136353, What is it? ,Classic
55405, Range zero seven. Dispersion unit on target.   They are leaving. Shall I fire? ,Classic
37763,"   Isn't it possible for your assistant to come down here, Commandant? But I'm not supposed to leave here. All right, sir. If you insist.  (Pinto picks up a medical bag and leaves. The Doctor enters and goes straight to ",Classic
92653," Nerva, transmat beam, Earth. It's as simple as that. Why don't you believe me? ",Classic
45259," You see, after the explosion, Doctor, we didnae know what to do. You said to come back here, which we did, but I'm sure we were followed. ",Classic
12233, How do you mean? ,Classic
29017, Probably die laughing. ,Classic
4707," No. You see, I don't know the price yet. ",Classic
100646," Professor Watson, can you hear me? ",Classic
143603, Alert maintenance. ,Classic
90926," Well, they might steal the plans, but why steal the circuits and the generators? An enemy government would have those resources itself. ",Classic
88969, What? ,Classic
114745, Ah. Peaceful looking place. That shouldn't give you too much trouble. ,Classic
62603," Because I won't allow it, that's why. I'm about to have him moved into hospital. Besides, you have no authority. ",Classic
155425, Thank you. That's very gracious. ,Classic
61950, All right. Where is he? Where is he? ,Classic
34198," Oh, one is as good as the other. ",Classic
118077," Quickly, Drax. ",Classic
39590, Transmutation of metal into gold. ,Classic
64547, We don't want the public to become panic-stricken. ,Classic
144170, And the Daleks have taken the Doctor prisoner. ,Classic
141613, The magnetic locks on the outer door are blown. They're in the airlock. ,Classic
30589, What's happened to them now? ,Classic
79001, You know me? ,Classic
113911, What? What are you talking about? ,Classic
97302, Like a sort of training ground.,Classic
23511, Where did he go? ,Classic
135434, My companion's. It has already been searched. ,Classic
57687, This one's still alive. ,Classic
143406," The Tardis! Bits of it anyway. Doctor, look what I've found!   Oh no, not you again. ",Classic
80190, Singapore. ,Classic
80869," Right, hang on a minute. Let's take a look at the plan. ",Classic
153435, They'll kill the Doctor! ,Classic
126799, All right? She'll be superb.  ,Classic
115852," Ah. Tell me, where were your men when they were killed? ",Classic
3438," Charming, Ping-Cho, charming. Susan, do you know that we use the word Hashashin in English today? ",Classic
99477," Come on, Sergeant. ",Classic
161090," Will they be all right, Professor? ",Classic
111794, There you are. ,Classic
104719, Papaver somniferum. ,Classic
153940, It was relevant enough to be bleeped from the Matrix record. ,Classic
108131," K9, are your batteries fully charged? ",Classic
61533," Oh, switch this thing off. ",Classic
33485, But it may be dangerous. They may not swallow my story. ,Classic
145788," Probably the reason Jek chose it. Anyway, I'm sure it's his main base. Take a small team, good men, do a quiet recce. As soon as I receive confirmation, I'll follow up in force. All right? ",Classic
34742," The great enemy, which we held at bay for so many centuries, the ever-lasting nightmare is here at last. ",Classic
111418, I'm not sulking. ,Classic
123818," Well, what's the hang up? I want to get off of this planet. ",Classic
67185, With an oil shaft? ,Classic
16071," No, won't turn. Hold on.   Ah, Excalibur!   Come on. No castles, no drawbridges. Back we go.   Vicki, just check it, eh? ",Classic
37028, Then please tell me where we can find them. ,Classic
69665," Yes, we've probably killed off that machine all right, but I'm not so sure about the Master. ",Classic
147841, The Cryons. ,Classic
147902," When they learn about this, they'll kill you. ",Classic
83560, Report. ,Classic
141392, No. The temperature level inside is below the range of the sensors. ,Classic
38118," Well, as I see it, there are two categories. People like your Director and that man over there whose originals are safe on board here. And then there are people like you two, whose originals have been left behind at Gatwick airport. If they're tampered with, you're finished. ",Classic
71519, Move! Move! ,Classic
96909, Sarah! Don't look down! ,Classic
140853, Black Scrolls of Rassilon! ,Classic
101450, I must apologise for my subordinate. He lets his enthusiasm run away with him. ,Classic
32052, Shall we have the demonstration now? ,Classic
66049, Professor Stahlman? ,Classic
57078, But this is quite ridiculous. T-Mat out of action and then this sudden outbreak of some sort of crop blight. ,Classic
129774, Love? ,Classic
599, Is he all right? ,Classic
45493, I think they must be moving. Come on. ,Classic
54516," If they're not, I'll destroy them. ",Classic
156733," Oh, forget it, Doctor. Let's hightail it back to the Tardis and get out of here. ",Classic
138377," Olvir said there wasn't one. So, why don't they repair it? ",Classic
143743," While you're doing that, I'd like a hand with the debris outside. ",Classic
158234," Hey, you'll miss the last dance, Doctor! ",Classic
91684, A slug? ,Classic
103071," Come on, let's all get back to work. ",Classic
38380," Mister Perry, I pay you the sum of 50 guineas per week, do I not? ",Classic
119567," So, the Doctor has the secret. The Doctor and the girl. ",Classic
4104, Is your caravan bound for Samarkand? ,Classic
86836," They'll find me, you know. ",Classic
128069," What's a Pharos, Doctor? ",Classic
76828, Let's try this way.,Classic
70723," Robert, there's nothing you could have done. They were both dead when we got here. ",Classic
85645," Now Professor, listen to me. This may come as a shock to you, so steel yourself. You have been brought back to the early years of the Middle Ages. ",Classic
13230," Yes. Yes, thanks. ",Classic
66472, Any problems with the accelerated drilling? ,Classic
91767," Well, there isn't very much to explain. We're just travellers in space like yourself. ",Classic
78000," Please, I'll get you one later. Come on, now just lie down and ",Classic
33910, You're making a big mistake! ,Classic
54994," Oh Jamie, you're right. We must save her! ",Classic
119118, Your thugs. ,Classic
78632," My lord, your holiness, most venerable priest of ",Classic
42277," Sir, hadn't we better get back while the weather still holds? ",Classic
2568," Trying to confuse me, eh? ",Classic
47098," Well, it doesn't matter, anyway. I mean, there's no danger, is there? ",Classic
23317," Look, Nicholas, you can't ",Classic
76824, Overlords! We must abandon the search. They will trap us here. ,Classic
28048, Yes. ,Classic
29371," What about the old Sawbones, Captain? ",Classic
8140," Oh, that's Barbara. We both found you. She's up in the spaceship. ",Classic
87821, Now you. Give me that. ,Classic
136075, Know the truth about the Mara. ,Classic
153380, In the constellation of Andromeda? ,Classic
125214, Yes unfortunately. ,Classic
2917, My caravan is further down the pass. Come.,Classic
101721, No. You show yourself first. Your real self. ,Classic
142622," Yes, that's enough, Turlough. ",Classic
28297, I've just seen three go past. ,Classic
77845," No, no, no ",Classic
118351, No. ,Classic
67608, No. I'll try and find some keys. ,Classic
69803, Mister Chinn! ,Classic
38755," But if they do that, allied with their own alien intelligence, they'll be invincible! Maxtible, you should've ",Classic
111947," Doctor, there are men out there planning to kill us, and you're just sitting here chattering. ",Classic
71261," I'm in command of the mining operation. If the girl isn't brought back, the survey stops. ",Classic
151777, As I thought the Borad was. So why aren't you? ,Classic
114359, I will so advise him. He has gone! ,Classic
75298," You're good, Doctor, but you're not good enough. ",Classic
16241, My dear boy! ,Classic
140172, Go on. ,Classic
7902, You will not be able to see. ,Classic
132016," Groggy, sore and bad-tempered. ",Classic
100284," ATime Lord has to do what a Time Lord has to do. Besides, you're not equipped. ",Classic
38880, You will obey us. ,Classic
165300," Without the flask, I was trapped. ",Classic
74825, What is it? ,Classic
21779, No human being can withstand their fire. ,Classic
141001," No, as a matter of fact, I don't. It's all illusion, child. We're close to the domain of Rassilon, whose mind is reaching out to attack us. Just ignore it, as I do. ",Classic
54489," Far from it, Packer. Have the guards search the building, just in case he's brought any friends with him. ",Classic
80325," No, she vanished, Jo. Two days out from Bombay on June the 4th, 1926, the SSBernice just disappeared off the face of the Earth. ",Classic
120710," Yes, yes, of course. Huntsman? See to it. It is a bit claustrophobic down here. ",Classic
39853," Tell them, Doctor. Go on, tell them. ",Classic
35490, What is nail varnish remover? ,Classic
139947," We are not demons and we've done no harm to the King, or to anyone. Nor do we intend any. ",Classic
156208," The vionesium, Mel! ",Classic
95228," Never better, Mister McRanald. What are you doing?  Mc ",Classic
106657, Very. ,Classic
122580," The door appears to be closed again, Soldeed. ",Classic
109263, Reconnoitre. ,Classic
72655," I reckon the Squire's right. Come on, let's get out of here. ",Classic
112614, I remember when I was a lad. Now things were very different then. You think you have no freedom now? You ought to have been here under old Queen Xanxia. ,Classic
96683, Strangled. ,Classic
78994," Groovy, isn't it? ",Classic
98888, No! No! I can't let you do it. ,Classic
146998, They want us alive. Mestor needs our calculations. ,Classic
159086, Well ,Classic
132269," Well, the other doctor.   WGGrace. ",Classic
27194, It's hard to say. ,Classic
60931, The war games on this planet are simply the means to an end. The aliens intend to conquer the entire galaxy. A thousand inhabited worlds. ,Classic
113345, Where's K9? ,Classic
133090, Look at this. ,Classic
27825," Yes, I forgot. ",Classic
71534, What discussion? You've already decided against us. ,Classic
71024, Where do you think you're going? ,Classic
57916, You think I let Clancey go too easily. ,Classic
128356, Take care. The research is far from complete. ,Classic
59461," Well done, Zoe. Can you undo it? ",Classic
10790, I eat. ,Classic
76157, We are expected then. ,Classic
52032," Well, really, I don't think this is the time for riddles. ",Classic
128414, It's getting old. ,Classic
162516," Dead right, Kingpin. ",Classic
105535, I do. I think he was taking Ben's body away for examination when you saw it. ,Classic
112777," Er, Captain? Captain, sir. ",Classic
15342," Well, you might ask. I mean, that's a good cardigan. ",Classic
77105, And I dispose of you all first? ,Classic
83784, Where are you off to? ,Classic
41906, One moment. You may not take weapons into the presence of the Master. ,Classic
15525, They've set the museum on fire! ,Classic
49739, What? ,Classic
99619, Where are we now? ,Classic
149714," I'm a pariah, exiled from Time Lord society, so they can always deny sending me. ",Classic
156654, Wait here.   Faroon. ,Classic
95000, Where have you come from? ,Classic
94087," New Phobos, originally, but Kellman's renamed it Voga. ",Classic
104626, Mi how ma! What happened? ,Classic
72318," Look, have you got a telephone I could use, please? ",Classic
97841," You feign ignorance, Time Lord? ",Classic
7109,   Don't be afraid. We'll take care of you. ,Classic
130160," Oh, I don't know. They wouldn't have looked a bit out of place in Terminal three. ",Classic
150169, Who are the Rutans? ,Classic
96074," Antimatter is simply matter composed entirely of antiparticles. Therefore, the hypothetical energy available, available, is, is stupendous. ",Classic
59324," Oh, it's not far. ",Classic
142160, Ben? ,Classic
22672, You can save your breath. We've got to try it. ,Classic
138323," Well, at least the level's acceptable, for the time being. Come on. ",Classic
49338," Well, it's a possibility. ",Classic
96498, Exactly where Horus left him seven thousand years ago. Trapped beneath a pyramid and powerless to move. ,Classic
146416, Transmission completed. Any problems? ,Classic
99304," You idiots. Listen to me. Whatever happens, it must not be harmed. Is that clear? ",Classic
69404," Oh, it won't get in there, mate. Me van's too big. ",Classic
157238, What? ,Classic
139945," Well, given the times he lives in, yes. But don't take my word for it. You'll be able to judge for yourself. Nobody forced Magna Carta from him. He could have crushed that rebellion as easily as that. ",Classic
92994," Don't you argue, Doctor. Now, just lift your foot very, very gently. ",Classic
33973, It's fantastic. What are those? ,Classic
157794, And me! And me! And me! ,Classic
148800, You think I'm crazy? ,Classic
70236," If the Axon walked into the reactor, he's simply committed suicide. ",Classic
88398, Nothing! We don't want any more idiotic tricks like that attack on the armoury. ,Classic
63657," Will you roll up your sleeve please, Doctor? ",Classic
142340," No, come and have a look at this. ",Classic
95979, Gravity drag increasing. ,Classic
108637," I will instigate action myself, your Aggrandizement. Instantly. Immediately. ",Classic
33153, Ha! Wouldn't pollute the firth with ye. Get in the boat. ,Classic
84152, Entering number six sector into main storage area. ,Classic
94101, You mean venom? ,Classic
121090, I do. ,Classic
88290, Move! ,Classic
129499," Salt. If you're an Earthling, how do you come to be on this ship? ",Classic
49026, Could you go further than that? ,Classic
154579, Dreams were to be expected side-effects of sedation. Nothing to worry about. ,Classic
114668, Why should we do that? ,Classic
146983, Did I threaten him? Did you hear me threaten him? ,Classic
32228, It's a lie! ,Classic
95250," Not so, Sarah. You might find a valuable lead. I want you to check any reference to McRanald Bay and Devil's Punchbowl. ",Classic
158837, I was looking for you. There's been an ice jam in the upper docking bay and the emergency services haven't responded. ,Classic
165812, You can do what they do. You can carry your prey home. You can help us escape. ,Classic
9090," He escaped, He was a desperate fanatic, citizen. He gave me this wound. I fought with him, prepared to give my life to stop his escape. But he fought with the strength of ten men. ",Classic
139794, Me? ,Classic
64806," Yes, of course.",Classic
97441, A two year journey. ,Classic
35805, Is the gravitron still switched on? ,Classic
81316," A job on one of those luxury space liners. First Officer on the Mars Venus cruise, that'd suit me. ",Classic
137609, But what for? ,Classic
99702, Feeling what? ,Classic
155742, Crucial. ,Classic
110583," Now look, you're surrounded. There's no way you can leave this craft and live. Didn't you hear me? ",Classic
30520, Fuel's gone. ,Classic
55, Is that the book you promised me? ,Classic
75946," Er, not yet, no. But I can, with your help. ",Classic
1597, Go on. ,Classic
148279," Yes, thank you, we have seen. ",Classic
107394, I trusted him. ,Classic
136561, Quickly.   Have you come to let me out? ,Classic
136309," Well, tell me! Look, all I want's a little information. What possible harm is there in that?   Tell me about the legend. ",Classic
13546, Bring your astral map out of your ship. ,Classic
76755," Why, I cannot. It is the language of the old ones. No one remembers. All our culture has been destroyed by the Overlords. ",Classic
26632," Don't push your luck, Kate, just go git your things while I tell Regret that there's been a change of plan. Git!",Classic
57221," Well, don't you see? It's what the Doctor said. Water. Rain. Well, it all makes sense now. They don't want it to rain on the fungus. ",Classic
25955," Sorry it's kinda quiet in here tonight, gentlemen. We, er, do reckon to have a singer only she's just stepped out a while down the ",Classic
12433," Hmm. Very well, then, very well, ",Classic
16248, The Tardis! ,Classic
93107," Your views are not important. General Ravon, I'll take these two back to the bunker for interrogation by the special unit. ",Classic
110156, I don't think you could. Ha! ,Classic
92147, No! The larvae have taken over the infrastructure. They seem to need solar radiation. ,Classic
146590," Well, of course it is. ",Classic
5394, Doctor! ,Classic
36828," I don't know, but you must fight them. ",Classic
122481, You are a liar and a coward.   You shall die. ,Classic
122491," It is very strange. It has the external appearance of something from a fairly primitive society, and yet quite obviously it is some form of travel space capsule. ",Classic
133044, What are they doing? ,Classic
133433, Yes. I want things to settle down before we go out. ,Classic
73381, You must not fail! ,Classic
86105," Well, thank you. Thank you both. I can do with all the help I can get. ",Classic
94291," As for the two humans from the beacon, have them killed immediately. ",Classic
109331, What? Good. ,Classic
83512, We will commence to administer the protective treatments immediately. ,Classic
136208," Why, my Lord? The man's clearly deranged. ",Classic
130027," Adric, I'm sorry. I really am. ",Classic
151004, What's wrong? ,Classic
111, What? ,Classic
125748," We have him safe now. Tomorrow, his spirit will be one with ours. Come, we must rest. And when we wake, we shall feed. ",Classic
117691, Very odd. ,Classic
82882," Oh, I don't know. I think you're doing yourself rather an injustice there. If you hadn't acted the way you did, we'd have all been captured. They give medals for that sort of bravery. ",Classic
121462, I would advise you not to play the fool with us. ,Classic
22770, No. Those belong to the other representatives. ,Classic
77110," Very good, Miss Grant. Very convincing. You forget one thing. The Investigator still has to get here, and his ship is no match for Skybase. ",Classic
27587, With the gun. ,Classic
158184," Yes, completely. Discretion's my middle name. I'll see you later. ",Classic
133659, Not without difficulty. ,Classic
72745, Then I am to be your choice? ,Classic
125331, Immature humanoid. Non-hostile. ,Classic
113841, It is the will of the Cailleach. ,Classic
90242, Silence! ,Classic
122752, Why? What did you do? ,Classic
159324, Coming. ,Classic
133074, Right. Stand by. Fire! ,Classic
83591, But the Daleks haven't been defeated yet. Not by a long way. ,Classic
142613, Doctor? Something's happening to the controls. ,Classic
116058," But if the dryfoot woman is gone, we can say that Kroll took her. ",Classic
93383, There is much to do. I want the genetically conditioned creatures installed in the machines immediately. Twenty of them. ,Classic
157082," Fifty six, fifty five, fifty four, fifty three ",Classic
118417, Anyone attempting to escape and the Daleks kill five of those remaining. Escape plans are not as popular as they were. ,Classic
99204, Guineas? ,Classic
99991, But he is no more in the eye of Demnos than any other unbeliever. ,Classic
18976," No wonder you had to bring everything. At least two of each, I suppose? ",Classic
23328, I'll come with you. ,Classic
81943," Mmm, and absolutely nothing to make it enjoyable, eh? ",Classic
74084," The delegate from Alpha Centauri has arrived, your Majesty. He will present his credentials to you shortly. ",Classic
11687, That is impossible. Tell me your story. ,Classic
49450, Cybernetics. ,Classic
43912," It paid off. All right, are you with us? ",Classic
101031," Which way, Eldrad? ",Classic
98112, I believe so. There were many on Karn then. They came from all across the galaxy to attend the trial of Morbius. ,Classic
10902, There'll be no escape once they get us inside there. ,Classic
104587," Are you here, Master? This is your servant, Li H'sen.   Answer me, Lord. If you're here, answer me. He has gone. Weng-Chiang, lord of greatness, has deserted me.   Lord? ",Classic
60710, Your alien superiors will want to question me. ,Classic
133793, Nice to see when we arrive. ,Classic
50430," No, but ",Classic
113285," Permanent regeneration based on cells in my old body, and thus containing all the memory patterns and all the brilliance built up over the centuries. ",Classic
12229," Well, you didn't know. I'm afraid I've got rather used to being on my own. ",Classic
156838, Why not? ,Classic

62393, You and your men are under arrest!,Classic
115461, He'll be halfway to Castle Gracht by now. ,Classic
69326," Good. All right, Fuller. Let us out, will you? No, Miss Grant. You will stay here as a guarantee of the Doctor's good behaviour. After you, Doctor. Satisfied, Mailer?",Classic
118096, The Marshal! ,Classic
134906, What? ,Classic
152305, It seems my agents were correct. Kara has employed assassins. ,Classic
26829," Oh, that's real handsome. Only it don't fit in with my plans. ",Classic
96526, Eliminate them. ,Classic
31044," Well, it could be a bluff. ",Classic
83428, The antidote is prepared and ready to be administered. ,Classic

108170," Oh, thank you, thank you. Thank you.   Rubus idaeus? ",Classic
128854, Still no way in. ,Classic
3423," Well, now, let me think, let me think. Yes, they were some kind of sect. Why? ",Classic
142671, To clean this wound. ,Classic
13875, Then it's decided. We attack!,Classic
71167, What good will that do? Dent'll deny everything and you'll be putting Jo's life at risk. ,Classic
153949, I'll just fetch my galoshes. ,Classic
157388, Greetings. ,Classic
88653," Right, bring it onto here, pointing that way. ",Classic
54484, Yes? ,Classic
75030," I realise only too well. Three ships have been sunk and many lives have been lost. Now, if you don't mind? ",Classic
129538, No. ,Classic
47073," You've got to face facts, old man. By tomorrow morning you're going to be a household word, a national figure. ",Classic
92654," Because Nerva doesn't exist, that's why. There's no such place. ",Classic
124824," Well, you're all so busy. Maintenance crews everywhere. What are you up to? ",Classic
83292," Come on, let's do it. I'm freezing!",Classic
54887," Inca, perhaps? ",Classic
27984," I shall miss you both, Dodo. ",Classic
4738," Me? No, no, no, not at all. Well, I think it's all marvellous. ",Classic
144156, We won. That's all that matters. ,Classic
75877," Maximum revs, sir. ",Classic
103519," There have been some localised failures in the main power system, resulting in door and light malfunctions. I have detailed circuit tracers to correct the faults. ",Classic
114574, I haven't finished presenting my case yet. I have another witness I wish to call. ,Classic
77492," Of course it is, Doctor Ingram. Of course it is.   You know, there is no means whereby I could prove to you that that crystal is any different from any other piece of quartz, and yet it is unique. As you say, ridiculous!",Classic
163876," Ernest, pray sit down. I'm afraid that something unforeseen awaits my attention. I shall have to ask you to indulge me a little further. ",Classic
59534," Well, things are starting to come back to me. ",Classic
14582," Well, who's taken her? ",Classic
165593, They're invincible. ,Classic
53332," Yes. Those circuits you gave me, they're rather fascinating. I like to know more about them. ",Classic
131219, I still control them. I am Aris. I have voice! ,Classic
67094, Professor! Professor Stahlman! Are you all right? You look ill. ,Classic
111574," I'm not scared, I'm just. Listen! ",Classic
123440," For genocide, Brock? ",Classic
11609," Ian, get clear. Run while you've got the chance! Run, Ian. Run.   Run, Ian, run. ",Classic
119791, The Jagaroth ship. ,Classic
18811, You do? ,Classic
54940, Doctor! Look. ,Classic
41560, Khrisong would be wise not to voice such thoughts. ,Classic
121861," It's all over, then. Switch off the machine. ",Classic
65768, When do you want to make this trial run? ,Classic
119920," Weeds? What, plant weeds? ",Classic
65140, I'll try.,Classic
43889," I still think I deserve an explanation, Leader. ",Classic
141036, Brigadier! ,Classic
161652," Go you far, ma'am? ",Classic
111725, Highness. ,Classic
87939, Can we get out again? ,Classic
90111, Wait. ,Classic
59, I'll have finished it. ,Classic
63750," Who's that?   Who's that?   Wright, gallery five, over. ",Classic
76955, Life in some form will always go on. ,Classic
77186," Hurry up, Cotton. I won't be able to hold them once they get in. ",Classic
38254, The police box on the runway. ,Classic
95823," We had nothing to do with those deaths. They were brought about by your intrusion. Listen, now listen to me, please. Here on Zeta Minor is the boundary between existence as you know it and the other universe, which you just don't understand. ",Classic
37388," Detective Inspector Crossland, Scotland Yard. ",Classic
8962, Have you had a similar coat like this in your shop? ,Classic
60185, Not until we find that tunnel. ,Classic
50608," And if we are to use these Dulcians as slaves there are certain qualities you must look for. Obedience, strength, sufficient intelligence to make them of use, but not so much as to make them dangerous. Is that clear? ",Classic
58030, Of course. ,Classic
104667, I've heard of it. Everyone has. It's the centre of one of the most noxious and evil rookeries in the East End. ,Classic
63333, Do you mean saboteurs? ,Classic
14541, I have been waiting to speak with you.,Classic
91997," Chap's jumped ship, that's all. Happens all the time. ",Classic
72292," Too late, I'm afraid. He's gone, just like the Professor. ",Classic
47101, Oh! ,Classic
5835," He must have died around 1430, I should think. ",Classic
62927," And the chart please. Chart!   Now, I want you to take a look at this. Have you ever seen anything like this before.   Yes? What? ",Classic
162513, You're not interested in beginnings. You're only interested in endings. ,Classic
40175, Stay! ,Classic
49212, How long? ,Classic
61446," In every one of these time zones, thousands of human beings fought and died in the belief that they were on their own planet. The survivors have now all been returned to their own times on the planet Earth, but the death roll is beyond counting. These lives were squandered in the course of a vicious and diabolical scheme to gain control of the entire galaxy. A scheme originated and devised by a race of which the accused is the leader. It was a was a highly organised scheme with an utterly callous disregard for the lives of the humans involved and for the liberties of all the other species in the galaxy which the accused would have dominated with his tyranny. In the pursuit of this scheme, brutal methods of mental processing were used which entirely contravened all the galactic laws. I will now call upon a member of our own race to sort this evil matter out. There will commence a reading of the witness' report. The witness is called. Will you step forward, please? ",Classic
132302," Ah, a screwdriver, Brewster. And? ",Classic
104333," You will explain yourself, Li H'sen. ",Classic
22710, That man! He was as much in the dark as we were and now he has the gall to ,Classic
108396, They're not questions we've ever thought about. I mean there's no answer. ,Classic
146544, It's Azmael. ,Classic
154850, What is all this confusion? Get out of the way. The Lord Kiv is unwell. Out of the way! ,Classic
163348, I'm not stupid. ,Classic
9215," And the sash, Citizen. It was when he took the insignia of a Regional Officer of the Provinces that I became, well, suspicious. ",Classic
99177," It might, and it might not.   Have someone bring her up to the library. ",Classic
20210," Oh Steven, what can we do to stop him? Do you know what he was planning? ",Classic
126125, Huh. Astral Jung. ,Classic
23633, What is this? ,Classic
36588," That's obvious, Polly, obvious. Because there's something trapped down there they wish to keep alive. ",Classic
116195," Careful. He just crushed the life out of him. Look at this, eighty gauge colodian just ripped to cardboard. ",Classic
49265, I told you. The same thing happened in the Perseus cluster a week ago. ,Classic
45985, Doctor! ,Classic
130821, I'd like to. ,Classic
106899, What will happen? ,Classic
97639," Oh, how could we ever have been fooled? ",Classic
105266, Sorry. Shouldn't you be using it to report Ben's death? ,Classic
62827," Well, I know this may seem a little far-fetched, but there are resemblances to ",Classic
12216, No. ,Classic
122928," Then off you go, then.   Ah, a very clever illusion. Quick, everybody through. Quick! Quick! ",Classic
162416," I'm with you, Doctor. And so's he. ",Classic
28214, If it is necessary. ,Classic
101112, Why is she a he? ,Classic
5241," I'm sorry, Sabetha. ",Classic
69395," Well, I shared a cell with a very strange chap called Raleigh. ",Classic
32720, It just went off. ,Classic
49686," Oh no, some more turned up. ",Classic
80115, Sir? ,Classic
147416," At the moment, suffice to say that this is Peri and I am known as the Doctor. ",Classic
80279, They've no sense of responsibility. Give them a hygiene chamber and they store fossil fuel in it.,Classic
23745, He's very weak. ,Classic
90241," Oh, I wouldn't say that. He's a highly intelligent fellow. You can tell at a glance. ",Classic
18864," Yes, yes, improbable dear boy, but possible. Definitely possible. ",Classic
147366, I heard me. Someone may be hurt. They may need our help. Come along. ,Classic
15730, I posted a relief guard and then came back here to see what was happening. ,Classic
89498," Well, that's just it. It's addressed to the Doctor or Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart or Captain Yates or, er, Sergeant Benton. It's from South America, sir. ",Classic
37141, Do you know these gentlemen? ,Classic
156971," Leave the quotes to the expert, Mel.   The rocket! It's a fixed trajectory. ",Classic
55364, They are not Gonds. ,Classic
42907," It's Victoria! Victoria, where are you? ",Classic
137505, Not another alarm? ,Classic
144872," With all due respect to your fellow Sarns, I think the people who built this had a more useful purpose than burnt offerings to Logar. Come on. ",Classic
94694, Activate firing controls! ,Classic
89589,   They must be just about to start. Let's find somewhere to hide. ,Classic
50993," Well, there's a Quark there waiting for us!",Classic
114803," Me. I am Count Grendel, Knight of Gracht, Master of the Sword.",Classic
33637, Help! ,Classic
153742, I know of values. Is your point that organics are of more value than robots? ,Classic
80900, President Zarb. ,Classic
122310, We must go to Skonnos for the sake of Aneth and our families. ,Classic
150528, It's the truth. I did not do this to myself! ,Classic
24977, Wait! ,Classic
2013," And there's always value in surprise. I know it looks difficult, but we must try it, my friends. Yes, we must. ",Classic
69378, Did you fix the machine? ,Classic
90352, I say what if she returns with a different plan? ,Classic
100819," It did, but fortunately it was absorbed. ",Classic
89338," You're sure you don't want to stay and take the job, Doctor? Civil service post with a pension. ",Classic
103344, What happened? ,Classic
107180," Now be reasonable, Thea. How could you have? You're as sane as anyone here. Except. Come on. Come on. ",Classic
3600," Only a fool defends his enemies. Be warned, Marco. They will set us at each other's throats by lies and deceit, and then, when they have divided us, then they will destroy us one by one. ",Classic
120039, Yes. What is this thing? ,Classic
25511," Just on my way, Mrs W. ",Classic
160342," Yes, it looks good. ",Classic
121095," Yes, the name of my ship. ",Classic
106801, Shall we try using our intelligence? ,Classic
124163, The dead planet? ,Classic
80151," Hey, Vorg. ",Classic
107485, Doctor! ,Classic
28749," Now just a moment, Sir Charles. Now look. If you close that road there, this and this, then we can funnel it into here, and there, gentlemen, we can spring our trap! ",Classic
22526, You will join the other human. Move! ,Classic
107471," Oh, the house is empty, then. Oh, I don't hold with all this. 'Tis agin nature. ",Classic
88452, He was my father's friend. He said he wanted to help us. ,Classic
112945," Come here and listen. Now listen, Kimus. The reason the stars in your sky change is because they don't. ",Classic
110071," Doctor, what's happened to you? ",Classic
106151, There's a voice or something in my head. ,Classic
49802, I don't see the point. We haven't got a laser to knock them out with. ,Classic
57207, What is it? ,Classic
41121," Hey, yes. ",Classic
15622, Come in.   Well. At last. You aliens have caused me enough trouble. I shall see that you pay for it.   You'll be a fool if you kill me. You will achieve nothing. ,Classic
51226, No! ,Classic
121281, I asked you not to put that particular image on. ,Classic
71183, I'm not leaving here without you.   Oh! ,Classic
110042," There's no longer a candidate. There's only the President. After his official induction, the Matrix can only be worn by the President. Therefore this is the President. ",Classic
109903," Yes, and if I hadn't, you would have killed me. ",Classic
112622, To save him from the Mentiads. At least he died a clean death. It was an act of mercy by the Captain. ,Classic
134732, Angela! Are you all right? ,Classic
44592," Giles, we can't. ",Classic
141817," You'll answer to a court martial for this, I promise, but first, you'll revive Maddox and decondition him. I want him ready for sync up. We must signal Sea Base Command. ",Classic
63, Mmm. ,Classic
89682," Of course I'm listening, Sarah. Go on. What happened next? ",Classic
34997," It can't be nice to him. Oh dear. How do you think he is, Doctor? ",Classic
100410," Ow. I can't move. Doctor! Doctor, please, help. Doc. ",Classic
35004," No, but he does. It's important to him. ",Classic
4909," Susan, answer me. ",Classic
17179, What is it? ,Classic
142685," Right-o, Doctor. ",Classic
61636," These didn't. These particular meteorites came down through a funnel of thin, super-heated air about twenty miles in diameter, for which no one has an explanation. ",Classic
109380, Why not? ,Classic
41356, Right. ,Classic
118065," Is that all you can say? She was a living being, and now what is she? A component. And Merak thinks she's still alive. No power should have that right, not even the Guardians. We must do something! ",Classic
99757, Where do you come from? You wear strange garments. ,Classic
108929, Blaster malfunction. Blaster malfunction. Blaster malfunction. Blaster malfunction. ,Classic
20878," The Daleks needed me. Without my help, they would never have got the co-operation of the masters of Celation and Beaus. We are on equal terms. ",Classic
152079," He may smell like rotting flesh, but he's an excellent squire. ",Classic
106331, Why Leela was unaffected. Have you met Leela? ,Classic
36137, Bring the stranger in. ,Classic
64837, Do you have the computations for lift-off? ,Classic
35121," That's enough. Now let's have a little calm thinking. For the past two weeks a completely unknown disease has appeared in the base. People drop in their tracks, they develop this black pattern on their skin. Then some of the patients disappear, right? Well, they can't leave the base without wearing space suits, and there are no space suits missing, so where are they? ",Classic
22660, But we do have a chance? ,Classic
64495, To delay us opening the capsule. ,Classic
112886, You mean you knew they were here? You knew that this mountain's really a spaceship and it's broken down? ,Classic
158173, A dance? With live music? ,Classic
113210, Mister Fibuli? ,Classic
163318, What are they? ,Classic
9245, We heard that somebody was. We did not know it was you. ,Classic
47522, Are bunk! And the rest of his tuppenny ha'penny tin-pot ideas. He's still a school kid with his bits of paper and his graph and his slide rule. You think I'm going to take any notice of him? I know every nut and bolt on every one of those rigs out there. ,Classic
25399," Well, er, alright, but for you, mind, not for him. ",Classic
91317, Okay. ,Classic
115196,"   I, Princess Strella, descendant of the Royal Kings of Tara, Mistress of the domains of Thorvald, Mortgarde and Freya, do humbly offer my loyalty to the King and do hereby recognise his suzerainty over me and all whom I command. ",Classic
107643, We've done it! ,Classic
71542, Why don't you check his credentials with Earth? ,Classic
24888," Habit, I suppose. Come on, we should follow. ",Classic
109969, Yes? ,Classic
63491, Ahead of the Brigadier. He wanted to make contact with the Silurians. ,Classic
116942," Ah. Oh. Oh, well, just before the Marshal arrested us, I did find somebody, and judging from the voice it was certainly a young woman. ",Classic
148073," Ah, that is enterprising. Your idea, Governor? ",Classic
116734, And where's Zeos? There's no sign of it. ,Classic
5521, You say you have three of the micro-keys in your possession? ,Classic
68958, Right. ,Classic
63524, Would your people agree to this? ,Classic
158822, That is correct. ,Classic
98567, They were in white-out conditions and their Snow Cat's fallen into a crevasse. But Mike is in touch with the Royal Marine Survival Team. They might be able to help. They'll try again as soon as the weather lifts. ,Classic
101116, Sarah thought you'd been obliterated. ,Classic
73608, I shall lead the expedition! This time there must be no mistake! The enemies of the Daleks will be destroyed!,Classic
138620," Listen to me. The cure works, but it needs to be controlled, otherwise you just trade one killer for another. Radiation induced diseases that may take years to show. ",Classic
104694, Found this in my cellar. Thought the Doctor might be interested. It could have something to do with those Chineses. ,Classic
124988, You're standing in the Great Book Room. These galleries contain manuals on the repair and maintenance of every single item on this ship. ,Classic
21185, Look! Look! The Daleks' ship made a bad landing. That gives us the time we need. ,Classic
28733, Why are you here? ,Classic
66638, And no one is being allowed in or out of this place. Do you get the point now? ,Classic
130450, Should we? ,Classic
110974, If you could just open the door. ,Classic
42062, At last. Come on.,Classic
121944, When we have fulfilled our part of the contract. ,Classic
37692, Oh I see. Well why didn't you tell me in the first place.,Classic
87445, You can't sink on Florana. ,Classic
93164, It is also an established scientific fact that there are more than seven galaxies. ,Classic
85693," It has no military value, no strategic significance. ",Classic
88914, Psst! Psst!   What's happening? Why is everybody working again? ,Classic
18465," Well, yes. Indeed. Of course, child. Yes, that's quite true, quite true. Yes, well, lead the way, lead the way. As it happens, I'd like to take a look round. What's this? What's this fellow doing? ",Classic
70516," Still at it, Doctor? ",Classic
136405, I've been sent to fetch you. ,Classic
121899, I want you to find the Hecate. Give me her position. ,Classic
112309," Why should I bother? No, Graff, their report will be with the Alliance shortly, and you'll no longer be a nobleman of the Cyrrhenic Empire, and an honoured war veteran. You'll just be a common criminal like us! ",Classic
49395, How? ,Classic
108556," Her cries will be clearly audible, your Honour. ",Classic
135695, You've sealed the Citadel? ,Classic
148587, Only if his women are released unharmed. Have you done that? ,Classic
88574," Now the Doctor is in good standing again, he will help us to clear up our problems. ",Classic
99592," Very neat, Miss Smith. ",Classic
93471, What chance do we have against them? ,Classic
61061," No, not yet. Now we wait.",Classic
56499, Miss Kelly! You cannot assume that responsibility without authorisation. ,Classic
11535," No, Tyler, no. I never take life. Only when my own is immediately threatened. Now then, let us make our way to this mine and then we shall know how to deal with these Daleks. Leave this creature to his own devices and salvation. Come along. You lead the way, my boy. Come along.",Classic
46702," You mean to say you've wasted all this time, just to ",Classic
122376," That's a lie. We crashed into his ship, but it had already stopped and the captain was already dead. ",Classic
55969, Canberra Moscow clear. ,Classic
90608, Take my hand. Quickly! ,Classic
77208, We can't! ,Classic
99360," Of course. Well now, I think it's time you ran along and got some sleep. ",Classic
8227," They are brave people, sir.  1 ",Classic
139779, I leave the lies and deception to you. ,Classic
71363," Now look, I've got all the proof you need. He murdered the Leesons. ",Classic
130171, Don't exaggerate. I only fainted. ,Classic
136883, Let me look at you. ,Classic
155752, A reckless streak. I'm prone to them. It wasn't difficult to pinpoint you. The first murder could only have been carried out by someone with access to this unit. The second needed poison. Even the abortive attempt on Mel's life could only have been committed by someone who could go unchallenged into the Isolation Room and get the anaesthetic. ,Classic
115325, He'll know it's a trap. ,Classic
137375, Haven't I done enough to separate him from his Tardis? ,Classic
41799, I wish there was something I could do. ,Classic
8139, I remember another girl. ,Classic
74652, But it would be a break with all precedent. I can't persuade myself that interference of this kind is justified. ,Classic
66224, They've checked and re-checked. There is absolutely no one answering to his description on their files. The man does not exist. ,Classic
90314, Why should you want to help me? ,Classic
10460, All right. ,Classic
77334, Duty? Your idea of duty was to keep this planet for yourself. ,Classic
72651," You rule? Ha! Why, you're all less than dust beneath my feet! ",Classic
84855," No, I'm afraid no, sir. Look over there. To the right.   Well, that means we're in trouble, doesn't it, sir? ",Classic
20176," Then you pour water over it, let it dry in the sun, and what happens then? ",Classic
86834, Creating monsters in central London? ,Classic
94473, We must attack the Cybermen with every weapon we have. ,Classic
96043," Oh, great. That's the thanks you get for helping people. ",Classic
154924, An investigator? ,Classic
7415," If you go with them, then they will have all the advantage. ",Classic
49359," No, not exactly. It's sort of draws the life out of it, you know. Corrodes it. You should see what it's done to the Bernalium stock. ",Classic
161499," We accept. Destroy the woman and her servant, and we will divide the planet into your slave groups and ours. ",Classic
27000," Now, Doctor, we have many questions to ask you. ",Classic
124923," And as such, their origins were not to be looked into. ",Classic
67437," Yes, in a way. Yes, that container held a form of alien intelligence. ",Classic
71414, They brought us in this way. ,Classic
102352, Good.,Classic
159544, You mean the Hand of Omega? ,Classic
112630, We're all murderers! Murderers! ,Classic
108314," You can't do anything, but there are fifty million people in this city. Think how the guards will react to that number. ",Classic
15744, Barbara! Are you all right? You look terrible. ,Classic
143991, Proceed. ,Classic
113458," We've done it, Doctor. ",Classic
22926," Well advise them again. Until you realise that these people are my prisoners, I shall refuse to hand them over. ",Classic
54347," Yes, sir, I heard. ",Classic
122888, You've brought it on yourself! ,Classic
26149," Howdy, sinners! Happen you're holding a prayer meeting? Why, I'd be proud to join you. ",Classic
60711," You've caused me a great deal of trouble and embarrassment. Now, I'm afraid, you're going to pay for it with your life! ",Classic
145249," A bad design. I've always said so. A few hours in one of those things, you start to cook. Still, better have them checked ready for issue. ",Classic
30423, There is really no point. They could never reach Earth now. ,Classic
129492, Athenian. ,Classic
6667, I have a task for you. ,Classic
76106, Kill one before he passes out. ,Classic
26124," Excuse me, gentlemen, gentlemen, you must have made a horrible mistake. Steven, my boy ",Classic
64110, Thanks. ,Classic
146632," You didn't give me much choice. Now look, Sergeant. ",Classic
101538, Escape? Escape is not in his mind. Now he is hunting you. ,Classic
53128," Right, Mister Vaughn. ",Classic
138602," It really isn't worth the trouble, you know. ",Classic
152531, Bostock! ,Classic
120757, But after fifteen years? ,Classic
122527, Why not? ,Classic
103183, No doubt you would. ,Classic
65899, What? ,Classic
13365, Just a minute! ,Classic
152467, He lies as freely as you pick up women. ,Classic
149266, Don't you? ,Classic
72212," Look, there is no time for all these unnecessary questions ",Classic
86959, I was brought here. Kidnapped! ,Classic
52315," As I always believed it would someday or other, my fortune to do. ",Classic
109985," Yes, that's what I thought. ",Classic
26907, Then you should have gone with him. ,Classic
42521," Spacecraft! Hey, do you reckon that's where the warrior's gone back to? ",Classic
104911, Very impressive. I'll have the Bird's Nest Soup. ,Classic
78802," Well then, Krasis will take me there. I'll speak with him immediately. ",Classic
155351," Poor Mister Hallett. I knew it was Hallett. I recognised him, remember? ",Classic
149947, That's if we get out of here alive. ,Classic
146402," Oh Doctor, stop it. ",Classic
14652," Yes. When Safiya and I were away, he came and burned my house. My wife and son were put to the sword. ",Classic
94260, You have no proof of this absurd allegation. ,Classic
25185," Henry, no! We don't know. ",Classic
5181," Oh, don't keep annoying me. These accusations. I can't afford to look after every fool that gets lost on the mountains. ",Classic
125905, The girl is a Time Lord. One of the ancient enemies of the Great One. She is to be held for sacrifice at the time of Arising. ,Classic
35041, Number 14? Ralph? Where are you? Scarpered. Funny bloke. ,Classic
58501," Sir, she's boosting. She must have spotted us. ",Classic
17160," I don't see why I should, my child. He'll learn soon enough. ",Classic
143536," Galloway?   Galloway!   Oh, Galloway. ",Classic
26056," Hold it. Boys, watch the door. And when Holliday comes through there, blast him. Okay! ",Classic
121043, Nothing works perfectly. ,Classic
112857," All guards on alert! There is an intruder on the planet. His name is the Doctor. I repeat, the Doctor.   He must be found and brought to the bridge instantly. ",Classic
87467, Hardly. Listen. ,Classic
38546," But he said if you'd care to come to the shop at about ten tonight, he'll see to you personally. ",Classic
66897," No, no, not an explosion exactly, he ",Classic
86480," That creature has an amiable disposition, Brigadier, and a brain about the size of a walnut. I think we should be able to deal with it, don't you? ",Classic
93925, Unless what? ,Classic
165740, Leave him alone! ,Classic
7365, But they'll never give it back to you. ,Classic
5657," Collect the key. Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Yes, yes. You understand? The villain that planned all this, the one who planned this whole affair, is now planning to collect the key! What a wonderful opportunity it gives us to catch him red-handed. And to release Chesterton!   You! ",Classic
110970, Naturally. ,Classic
21958," But. Oh, very well. ",Classic
36399, You'll do as you're ordered. ,Classic
8838, I'll ask you once more. Did they talk to each other? ,Classic
124471," I don't believe it. I don't believe it! All component parts functioning normally, ha! Pah. You mean to tell me that after all we've been through, the systems are functioning perfectly? ",Classic
109478, The bridge'll be guarded. ,Classic
131195, Mirrors? ,Classic
62808," It's all right, old chap. Take it easy. Hold him there. ",Classic
64569, I don't understand it. Who would have done this? ,Classic
10394," Yes, I believe you're right, Susan. ",Classic
105513, She couldn't have seen it. ,Classic
10868," That sounds fine, but how? We can find fifteen, perhaps twenty men. ",Classic
132387, Why didn't I leave after the cricket? ,Classic
16612, We are locked in pursuit course. ,Classic
127958, And there's no saying what that might do to the Tardis systems. Can you swim? ,Classic
10533," Well, we can try, anyway. There's nothing like a good fire, is there?  ",Classic
78147," Yes, yes, yes, I saw the thunderstorm myself. What next? ",Classic
133488, Do you remember what you asked me after we deactivated the bomb?,Classic
101252, Three hundred and four. ,Classic
162669," Now, what seems to be the problem? ",Classic
43474, What good will it do me? ,Classic
144481, It's never platinum. ,Classic
18614," No.  )Unable to contain his curiosity, Steven wanders around the chamber, examining the unfamiliar equipment.) ",Classic
40941, We've got to stop that thing somehow. ,Classic
93022," Two prisoners, sir, captured section 101. ",Classic
164430,"   Captain, we've lost the others. ",Classic
51495, And if they attack us again? ,Classic
132666," All right, old chap. All right. ",Classic
7075, The door's been locked on the other side. Quickly. They're in danger. We must get in from the other end. ,Classic
142494, Let's find the Doctor. There's nothing we can do. ,Classic
110499, Dismantle it? That's not possible. ,Classic
95043, Will he be okay? ,Classic
94827," All the same, he did save us a long walk, sir. ",Classic
87741," Oh, not much. ",Classic
125573," You know something? I don't think they want to be followed. Let's sit down.   Oh yes, this is much more comfortable. What were those Hydrax officers called? ",Classic
133117, They are too late. ,Classic
19066," A hearing will commence at once. As Deputy Commander, I will preside. Baccu has undertaken to put the charges. ",Classic
96746, Then this one can be destroyed. ,Classic
156231, Glitz. Glitz. Sabalom Glitz.   Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead. ,Classic
60811, Some sort of trick. ,Classic
21664," Dispatch a rescue ship to their aid. They will be dealt with on their return. Meanwhile, I will personally supervise recovery of the core. ",Classic
70232," Very well. Yes, the readings are slightly up. What is all this? ",Classic
12738, In person. ,Classic
124442," Well done, K9. Well, now we've dropped off our Earth friend we can be on our way. ",Classic
92989, Wedge something under it. Make it firm. ,Classic
49952, He's dead. ,Classic
87440, No. ,Classic
73289, What is it? ,Classic
83197, But you were. ,Classic
130853, Aris has found voice. ,Classic
64867, Don't you think I've tried? I've tried every possible delay. ,Classic
128136," They must be creating a temporary zone of stasis around the Tardis, but I don't really understand their science. ",Classic
112441," That's what I said, K9. Piece of cake. ",Classic
36865, It's the gas! It's coming in here. ,Classic
111144," Nonsense. Rear area now, storeroom fourteen D. Onward! ",Classic
42282, Arden was always a researcher. He wanted to be an archaeologist when I knew him. ,Classic
129865," No, no, no, no, no! ",Classic
5745, I'll never leave you. ,Classic
92828, We've still got a chance. If this intended to kill us ,Classic
109866, Halt! ,Classic
65154, You will not need your life support systems. An environment has been prepared for you.,Classic
15297, Doctor? ,Classic
102785, Keep us ignorant and afraid. Make us hate one another. ,Classic
119454," When you work for the Borgias, you believe anything. ",Classic
157809," And look, here it is. Oh, it's just how I imagined it. Why don't the residents of the Towers ever use it, Pex? ",Classic
121690, I haven't got anything. ,Classic
120158, It kills people. What more is there to know? ,Classic
55547," Oh Doctor, can we go now? ",Classic
108860," Thirty four seven? That's beyond visual aid range.   Listen, Leela. Listen! Ion drive, or I'm a budgie's cousin. ",Classic
79831, Come on. ,Classic
109682, You're making a terrible mistake. Those are the wrong ones. ,Classic
68875, Prison reform is high on our list of priorities in Peking! ,Classic
94825, What an odd man. Rather mediaeval in his ideas. ,Classic
64268, Anytime within the next twenty four hours. ,Classic
44742," Mine.   It's amazing how alike you and Salamander are. Incredible. You fooled me the first time we met, but now, even Salamander himself would think he was looking in a mirror. Why? You want this man to impersonate Salamander, why? How much are they paying you? ",Classic
5530, What exactly are these psychometric tests? ,Classic
125441," Yes, long since dead. ",Classic
44371," I don't enjoy travelling.   Oh, this is good. That Griff's a genius. ",Classic
70474," Well, is there anything we can do? ",Classic
109085, What's happening? ,Classic
36655, I need help immediately. The strangers obey nothing. They are turning taps in the wrong direction. ,Classic
118869," Not me, you fool! ",Classic
119630," You don't seriously believe all this time travel nonsense, do you? ",Classic
29184," The Churchwarden to you, sawbones. ",Classic
57408," Right, then I'll be off. ",Classic
127000, Sacred law decrees that the Keeper has contact only through his consuls. ,Classic
39785," Jamie, Jamie! ",Classic
156504, Always providing they don't flush us out first.,Classic
105806, I was never in the lamp room. ,Classic
18476," Power. We must have power for launching our spaceship. The suns are too weak to supply this power, therefore, by drilling we may find some in the ground. ",Classic
130504," Oh, I see. ",Classic
45586," Well, come to think of it, we didn't hear anything either. We should have heard something, even at this distance. ",Classic
163466," Your move, Merlin. ",Classic
69799," Yes, yes, so am I. Doctor?",Classic
158413," Kill any other survivors. Tie these two up. They will not be hostages, but bait. ",Classic
65029," No. No, thank you. Lock the door, won't you? ",Classic
46519," No, no, no, he didn't steal it. The person who did planted it on him. ",Classic
39474," I've scouted around, but I can't see any water. ",Classic
93846," Ah! Good. Let's go. Back, back!   Back! ",Classic
10660," Be careful, my child. ",Classic
58903," Oh, I'm glad to hear it. Well, we've got some checking to do there anyway. ",Classic
75034," Yes, a pretty impulsive fellow, if one can believe the history books. ",Classic
161653," Far? Oh, I just came over from London. ",Classic
110742, I shall issue instructions and take control immediately. ,Classic
73429, Stay where you are! ,Classic
1959," At least it might stop some of these, these things from bothering us. ",Classic
401, The creature has opened its eyes. ,Classic
80164," It indicates a systems defect, doesn't it? ",Classic
134661, But why work against itself? ,Classic
150036," Do you know, I wish I could remember what that blue line serves. ",Classic
143810, Let him go. ,Classic
35723," Deflected? Yes, of course. The gravitron. ",Classic
60474, It's possible. ,Classic
79187, Yes. ,Classic
129634, They must be lying or mad. Three billion people on one ship? It'll never get off the ground. ,Classic
18385," Yes, Maaga. ",Classic
91110, Philips will show you the short cut back to your car. ,Classic
145140, Doctor? Are you okay? ,Classic
66681," And they might shoot us out of pure nervousness. Just wait our chance. Don't worry, Petra. When the time comes, we'll get out of here and it'll take more than a bunch of tin soldiers to stop us.  Doctor's workshop]",Classic
77992, I'm Jo. ,Classic
65381, Is there a way out? ,Classic
33344, Twas a picture right enough. ,Classic
28797," Well, I'm afraid we can't check up on that now, my boy. My machine has to face WOTAN before noon! ",Classic
18214," Doctor, come on. What are you standing there for? ",Classic
117096," Zero two's gone, sir. ",Classic
133162," Well, there is somewhere. We just don't have enough of the pieces yet. ",Classic
23979, The telephone. I've got to ring up. ,Classic
165586," They're essentially a fun-loving species. Now, Doctor, there are things I must discuss with you.",Classic
124436," You ready, K9? ",Classic
142766, Now what? ,Classic
93226, What are they doing down here? ,Classic
37991," Of course I do, Jamie. I am the Director. ",Classic
21754, I hope you are right. ,Classic
50266, Oh no! ,Classic
39924," Don't worry, with Toberman to guard me. What is more important is to keep an eye on these strangers. ",Classic
122867, Larder? ,Classic
41232, Sphere? ,Classic
62229, And what will you do now? ,Classic
129594, Where are the others? ,Classic
5485, I had to go to the Guardian building again. They're asking questions about   You're one of the people with Chesterton. What are you doing here? ,Classic
155958," I don't think so, Stackyard. It all begins to make very good sense. ",Classic
154417," Ah, I appear to have lost my way. I was looking for Crozier's operating room.   Thank you. Most kind. ",Classic
120244, You mean? ,Classic
74402, Exactly. And if Peladon marries this Earth princess the blood relationship will be strengthened and could be used to foster Earth's interests inside the Federation. ,Classic
16144," I see. Well, we're very grateful for your hospitality but I must you the Daleks are right on top of us. And I don't want either you or your people involved in any of this dangerous business. If they knew you'd given us shelter, they'll show no mercy. ",Classic
16517," Oh, rubbish, there was no noise before that. Come along, come along. ",Classic
47037, What's he going to do? ,Classic
96996, Why? ,Classic
154256," Then search them, profitless fool! ",Classic
106885, Never. You do. I've heard you. You called it she just a moment ago. And another thing. It is quite clear to me that you cannot control this old machine either. ,Classic
83568," He's right, you know. One bomb won't destroy them all. The most we can hope for is to stop that army getting into action.     Okay, come on.",Classic
156571, Completely. ,Classic
20256," We build it hollow, and we fill it with soldiers and leave it on the sandy plain for the Trojans to capture it. ",Classic
92261," Oh well, obviously I am not going anywhere. Help me, Doctor. ",Classic
140225, And you haven't your compressor. ,Classic
144004, Lytton. ,Classic
124739," Intruders, Decider. This one unsealed the entrance. ",Classic
10658," Oh my dear, now believe you me, I wouldn't spoil your homecoming for all the world. ",Classic
25139," Fool, you stay here and look after these chairs. ",Classic
71958," Yes, of course. Mary? ",Classic
43049, No hope for our engines then. ,Classic
39828, It sounded like an engine. Something came down over there behind that rock. ,Classic
17052, Quick! That cable's on fire and the whole buildings collapsing! ,Classic
125197, Doctor! ,Classic
102264, She would have opposed me. I said stay where you are! ,Classic
28848," Key, that reminds me. I forgot to give him this one back. ",Classic
46242," Well, aye, just now. There's a man ",Classic
133034," All right, hold your fire. When I give the word, go for the one on the right. Now!   Got him! ",Classic
101094, Get back. Get back!   You all right? ,Classic
128929, You overheard? ,Classic
111757, Ah. They must have used a rope ladder. ,Classic
60566, Are you blaming me for that? ,Classic
80763," Well, haven't you ever been to the zoo? Have you never kept goldfish in a bowl? ",Classic
140205, Nothing more than simple concentration and psychokinetics. Look again. ,Classic
74789, Don't ask me for reasons. You wouldn't believe them. ,Classic
3464," With such a caravan, Noghai would be invincible. ",Classic
58667, What are you going to do with them? ,Classic
91902," Yes, Noah? Where are you? ",Classic
16547, What are you talking about now? ,Classic
122407, Must be the Nimon. ,Classic
99246," Right, get out.   I shall set the machine on automatic control, which means it will start up again in a few minutes time. Your death will be agonising, Doctor, but mercifully quick. ",Classic
133932, Look! ,Classic
27713," Oh, it's wonderful to see you. ",Classic
161536," Give her the arrow. See!   Forgive me, my lady. ",Classic
57366," Lend it me, will you? ",Classic
12343," Oh, what's that supposed to mean? ",Classic
56299, It needs the one thing that you have not got. Time. ,Classic
33960, I come with you. ,Classic
36645, Full pressure. ,Classic
100417, What? ,Classic
78747," Yes, Lady. ",Classic
114807, Only to superstitious fools. ,Classic
77588, Two point oh four five. ,Classic
161937, We need him. ,Classic
60108, The aberration is only temporary. He was probably involved with tracking down some German spies before he came here. It has obviously become a fixation. ,Classic
85406," That strange armour you wear suits you, Linx. ",Classic
94614," Oh, please, don't call me human. Just Doctor will do very nicely, thank you. Is that your rocket? ",Classic
137012, You will be destroying one of the most evil creatures in the universe. He calls himself the Doctor. ,Classic
67938, I will not give up. He's lying low somewhere and we've got to find him. ,Classic
104341," Lord, I promise you will have the great cabinet of Weng-Chiang before another dawn. ",Classic
10124," And whatever you do, don't look into the cat's eyes. Close your own if you want to. ",Classic
79994, That old chap? ,Classic
91233, Take them away. ,Classic
130042, All right. ,Classic
147677, But not enough to justify the heavy casualties being sustained by our resuscitation team. Cease reactivation. ,Classic
118729, The night the roof fell in on Agella.   ,Classic
8877, Treasure? More likely dropped by a passing traveller. ,Classic
142884, You deny you're at war with us? ,Classic
135327," The Council Chamber, I suppose. ",Classic
127636, But the Doctor! ,Classic
145172," You're such a pain, Doctor. ",Classic
104317," Stay here.   Leela! Leela, no! Don't! Leela. ",Classic
126652, I wish you luck. But what about us? Have you got any ideas on that count? ,Classic
37430, It looks like a fountain pen to me. ,Classic
21514, Feeling better? ,Classic
148461, I had the most peculiar dream   You'll forgive me if I don't join you. ,Classic
143434," The, the Tardis! ",Classic
144678, It's the same route the molten lava will take to burn you alive. I have a ship. I can get you away from here. Think about it.   Is this from Trion? ,Classic
88570," A little bit of light hypnosis. It brings out his sweeter nature, doesn't it, old chap, hmm? Come and tickle his ears, Sarah. ",Classic
103838, Kill the humans. Kill the humans. ,Classic
68334," You're on camera.   Oh, good morning. Er, observers from UNIT. My admission pass. ",Classic
68383," Not full. The indicator registers only sixty five percent at this time. The machine has been used very successfully in Switzerland. A hundred and twelve cases have been processed to date and today we shall witness the one hundred and thirteenth. Thank you, Doctor Summers. ",Classic
21455," There can't have been. There were only my mice. I know, I set them here myself. ",Classic
29508," Indeed not, Cap'n. Very wicked. ",Classic
7350, We will attack you. ,Classic
111123, Nonsense. ,Classic
105243," Ben knew every blessed inch of that there machine. Don't make sense, boy. ",Classic
47765," Jamie, try the kitchen. ",Classic
122889, You will die for your interference! ,Classic
155026," If I seem to lack gratitude, young woman ",Classic
105501," Well, if this contraption works, I'll see what the proprietors have to say. ",Classic
145855, What future? ,Classic
164568, Subsidence. And since the grave was dug. ,Classic
50146, I suppose you've come for me. ,Classic
146308," He was going to kill me, Peri. ",Classic
150933," But I helped you! You can't execute me. Maylin, listen to me, please. ",Classic
39962," No, not really. I think it's about time we gave Mister Klieg a chance to show off his archaeological skills? I love to see the experts at work, don't you?",Classic
54714, Do you think that Russian rocket stands any chance? ,Classic
47957," Hey, isn't that Van Lutyens' torch? ",Classic
77391, It started as soon as we got in here. The first dose didn't do him any good. Now this lot on top. ,Classic
76375," And mutual co-operation between our two peoples. A bold concept. Two different cultures, far apart in terms of development   Uniting together to create a new society, a new and richer world. Now, after five hundred years of ",Classic
65210," Yes, this object has been spotted by observers all over the world. ",Classic
77362, That is a rational and intelligent creature. To kill it would be murder! ,Classic
63926, The other one is a soldier. He is dangerous. Kill him! ,Classic
116217, I'd have sacked him. ,Classic
2153," Yes, I think you're right. We'll have to get over there. ",Classic
36518, We couldn't have an alarm. It's impossible. No one ever escapes. Calling Pit Guard. Close exits to all gas shafts. Stand by. A prisoner has escaped. Shoot on sight. ,Classic
6658," Yes, of course he followed you. But never mind about that. How does that door work? ",Classic
84201," Well, it can't. ",Classic
67574," Myself, the Brigadier and The Doctor. ",Classic
86156," I'm sorry. I'm afraid we must be off. Goodbye, Hal. ",Classic
135181, Something's coming through. ,Classic
9401," Oh, never mind about that now. {LeMaitre's office]  What happened? Where's Susan? How is she? ",Classic
29831, Are we forestalled? ,Classic
75622," All right then, Doctor. What do you want me to do? ",Classic
110385, Thought they were game at first. Jasko nearly put a spear through them. ,Classic
22001, While we have the taranium their plan cannot work. ,Classic
55825," You can, Doctor. ",Classic
19810," Glory that is Greece, hmm? A neat phrase. ",Classic
48778," Well all right, stick your rod dimen ",Classic
6568, Serenity. ,Classic
129077," It? And what, sir, is it? ",Classic
31199, Life depends on change and renewal. ,Classic
4661," What, this little thing? ",Classic
26354," You can stay out of sight. Lay 'im out, Bat, if he tries anythin'. ",Classic
14205," How is he, my dear? Did he take the drug I gave you? ",Classic
101260," Malfeasance, Hildred. ",Classic
12984, They all applauded as though it was me. ,Classic
107635," No, better save some for later. ",Classic
43284," Of course, the computer's right. We must be prepared, and we must wait. ",Classic
146304, Peri! ,Classic
58983,   Oh dear. ,Classic
83952, Hello? I'll speak to anyone. ,Classic
36959, Who was he? ,Classic
9758," He won't be content with that. I've watched his promotions. Bonaparte's clever and ambitious. If he gets a foothold to power, one day he will rule France. ",Classic
112241," Money isn't everything, Garron. ",Classic
135515," No! Nyssa, I will not have blood spilt to save my life. ",Classic
24253," But of course they care, my dear. Now don't worry. It's not your fault at all. If it's anybody's, it's mine. ",Classic
65078, Temporary fuel injection malfunction. We're checking it out.,Classic
66166, Quite so. My apologies. ,Classic
80273," You tell them, uncle.",Classic
135353, I should have thought the most important ,Classic
79215," Right, force field on. ",Classic
5998, Yes. ,Classic
159193, I know you can hear me. I'd like to propose a transaction. My very final transaction before I leave Svartos. ,Classic
124306, Magnifying it. Concentrating it. The five beams they throw out can be made to converge on any point in the galaxy. ,Classic
90694, Oh no. I don't think I can take much more. ,Classic
109640," Five, four, three, two, one. ",Classic
138296, More spots of blood. Try them again. ,Classic
160698, Galactic Centre. ,Classic
55492, Do you have a better idea? ,Classic
70855, Maybe that's been my mistake.,Classic
120565, We should have heard something by now. ,Classic
21027, Execute! ,Classic
32889, But what would we need money for? ,Classic
42761," Perhaps later. For the moment, you are useful to us. Zondal. ",Classic
86361, Oh no!,Classic
40675," Why, Doctor, if I had only known you shared my imagination, you might even have worked for me. ",Classic
18076, It's imperative that we leave at once. ,Classic
80495," What's that? Do you know, you'll think I'm an awful idiot, but do you know ",Classic
38321," Yes, well, Tardis, that's another name for it. ",Classic
13202," Anything wrong, Doctor? ",Classic
1187," No, it must be me. ",Classic
44626, We had orders to kill. ,Classic
87562," It's a chemical. It can be found in minute quantities on Earth, but it's so rare there that it's virtually priceless. A chemical detecting satellite did a fly past on this planet and registered that it was as common here as salt. ",Classic
145780, How do you know it was faked? Maybe they were just bad shots. ,Classic
38365, It's here. ,Classic
30952, It's no use talking to these geezers. ,Classic
152109," Like the old days, Bostock. A crusade against evil. ",Classic
76842, Why does no one come? Where are my warriors? ,Classic
56589, We should just about be coming into range now. ,Classic
10698, We shall be as quick as we can. And you bathe that ankle. What you need is a jolly good smacked bottom! Come on. ,Classic
100886, That's true. ,Classic
118608," No, no, no, we had that conversation last time we met. I'm more interested in your survival. I saw you destroyed. The Daleks blasted you at point-blank range. ",Classic
141156," Perhaps, but you will never overcome me. ",Classic
123027, They want it all. The whole of Argolis. ,Classic
154270, I could have sworn you belonged to that stupid breed. ,Classic
94870," Ah well, it's true he's no the Duke I remember. He's been a different man since the oil companies came. ",Classic
114842, You don't look like a peasant. ,Classic
94114," When this trouble first started, we turned part of the infrastructure into a mortuary. ",Classic
96889, I really must get the Tardis seen to. She's way overdue her five hundred year service. ,Classic
57272, No. ,Classic
58283," Yes, Jamie, you're right. ",Classic
85793," Yes, he's your enemy, I assure you, not me. We'd be well advised to join forces against him. ",Classic
107036," I've had it with you now, you old stoat. Any more trouble and I'll have you outside and set the dog on you. ",Classic
61411, It's all right. It can't possibly harm us. ,Classic
27559, Listen. ,Classic
5044," Help me, Ian. Help me! ",Classic
74123, Doctor? ,Classic
76779, I've been studying the monitoring reports since the storms. ,Classic
144954, The seismic scanner. Something's happening inside the volcano. ,Classic
48818," Well, when we've digested our dinner we'll have another try to get into the control room. ",Classic
153000, Oh! ,Classic
64004, I managed to close down the reactor. ,Classic
45784," It's a foreign power, ain't it? Bacteriological warfare, that's what that stuff is in the tunnels. ",Classic
165512, Yeah. So when did they go? ,Classic
15604, Yes sir. We have seen no movement. ,Classic
105024, That's right. Me because I'm quicker. ,Classic
165791," When I'm hungry, I hunt. When I hunt, I eat. ",Classic
42250, I don't need a computer. ,Classic
135505," You know the choice we have to face, Doctor. Our duty, if not our conscience, is clear. ",Classic
100181, What do you mean? ,Classic
98053, What are you doing here? ,Classic
125498," Bad luck, mostly. ",Classic
47555," Well in the first place, you don't want to get stung like your wife, do you? And in the second place, whoever put it in your file meant you to touch it. ",Classic
105426," I said, do not move. ",Classic
73089, You wish to see this planet destroyed? ,Classic
58633, Why? ,Classic
124719, The Starliner is closed. ,Classic
137385, Yes. ,Classic
92342, I'll have to. ,Classic
103151, I assumed she knew. ,Classic
128562, Gone? Really? Did she leave a note? ,Classic
4563," Use that, use that. ",Classic
104727, Your leg! ,Classic
102122, Cursed be the tribe of Tesh. ,Classic
112927," This way. The interior of the mines are fully automated. There is an ancient lift shaft, but nobody's used it in living memory. ",Classic
44986," Ah, maybe. ",Classic
107554," Oh no, that was just a lucky shot up the throat. It's not a throat of course ",Classic
145846, They believed he was spying for the Government. ,Classic
3476," Wait, Ian. We will search together. The city is divided into distinct areas. Tegana, you will take one, we will take another. We will meet back here in two hours time. ",Classic
32330, Might you now? I'll tell you what you will do. You'll order your guards to disarm and place yourself under arrest immediately! ,Classic
6383," If I take that course, there is no way back for me. In all humility, I beg you, do not deceive me or prove false to me. ",Classic
25155, Don't touch them! ,Classic
68772, It's no good. The line's dead. ,Classic
98556, Radio. ,Classic
109691," You have found them. Well done, Rask. Quickly. ",Classic
73812, Does he? I wonder why? ,Classic
52065," But, but you're not Jamie. ",Classic
57101, Please! Let us answer one question at a time. ,Classic
155441, What happened? How did she get in that state? ,Classic
84733, Mmm? ,Classic
136414," Please, my Lord. ",Classic
52553, My brain is the source of the creative power which keeps this operation going. ,Classic
78528, Okay. ,Classic
83413,   I haven't the faintest idea.,Classic
26887," Goodbye to you all. Come along, Kate. ",Classic
37063," Of course I am. Look, are you going to direct me or not? ",Classic
99124," What's all this? Oh sir, I hear Mister Keeler ",Classic
128107, A fault in the computation? ,Classic
11443," Right, you can just turn around and go out again. ",Classic
135765, He wants nothing for himself. The power he brings is for the good of all. ,Classic
41242, Gone? ,Classic
122834," Very well, prepare to blast it open. ",Classic
113940," Well, it's got to be somewhere. ",Classic
165731, Anything else? ,Classic
93948," Until then, there's a constant danger of space collision. ",Classic
163995, Did those husks really used to be him? ,Classic
19956," Oh, hear me, you horses of the heavens, who gallop with our destiny. If you would accept this gift, let us see a sign. Show us your will, I pray you, for we are merely mortal and need your guidance. ",Classic
35751, We must get back control soon. He could flood half of Europe if he keeps the gravitron aligned with spring tides. ,Classic
7804, Yes. ,Classic
158365," Ah, these tyre marks show a heavy motorcycle and sidecar. Come on. ",Classic
144386, Not even a machine. ,Classic
33043, Why come to me? ,Classic
32539," Do you hear me, Daleks?! You will obey my orders! ",Classic
19999," Right. Well, bye, Cressida. We shall meet again this evening, all being well. ",Classic
157523," Build high for happiness, Doctor. ",Classic
38507," If only we knew what he looked like, Jamie. ",Classic
137954, We thought you were on Mawdryn's ship. ,Classic
141766, What about Maddox's conditioning disc? ,Classic
79465," Man Friday, would you believe? ",Classic
118163," Well, I mean, as you know, sir, the sixth segment was in fact a human being, and I mean, if the pieces are maintained in their present pattern it means that she'll be imprisoned forever, sir. ",Classic
74890," My dear Doctor, don't think I'm not grateful. I've had a chance to think about things while I've been in here. ",Classic
159783, Doctor? ,Classic
75762, And what about the Doctor? He may still be alive down there too! ,Classic
57398," Oh, obviously that has to be stopped. ",Classic
150902," As I seem to keep saying, that's beside the point. Once inside a time tunnel, the Tardis may undergo an adverse Kontron effect. ",Classic
47705," You should have listened to me, Robson. ",Classic
161909, Do something! I've got it. ,Classic
57758," Still ninety minutes to go, sir. ",Classic
162975, He'd better not be gone when we get there. ,Classic
30356," Yes, well, I'm afraid all that's going to be rather difficult. ",Classic
62090, The Autons have lost Ransome. He is beyond their range. ,Classic
123599, Stop! Let me go! Let me go! The Doctor's in there! Let me go!   What are you doing?   Doctor! ,Classic
131141, What's that supposed to mean? ,Classic
116152, I still favour depth charges. I'll go and check how many we've got. ,Classic
60476," This is a matter of security. Security is my responsibility, as you often remind me. ",Classic
73201," You know, Doctor, if you didn't spend so much time tinkering around with this wretched contraption, you'd realise just how bad the international situation's become. ",Classic
80720," There's more than one of those things about, Jo. Let's go.",Classic
14461," Escape? But how? A never-ending story. What am I going to do? Stories. Stories. Shakespeare! Yes, Romeo and Juliet. Hans Christian Andersen. Lilliput. Gulliver's Travels. ",Classic
40310, Precisely. Your complete lack of administration made it ideal for our purpose. ,Classic
3270," If we're very careful with it, yes. ",Classic
140291, And who knows when it will end. ,Classic
45737, What's the plan then? ,Classic
125076, This knowledge and more. The assistant Deciders concur? ,Classic
130527, Yes. ,Classic
145274," You will stand there until I've finished with you, and when you address me, you will call me sir. ",Classic
85350, I'm sorry? ,Classic
143921, So we're letting him go. ,Classic
142518, I'd feel happier with a gun. ,Classic
161439," Oh, I do love a jam session.   This is ridiculous. Who did this to you? ",Classic
8277," Yes, but they asked me not to tell you what their plans were. ",Classic
122853, Yes. ,Classic
85103," Oh, it's very curious. Well, I shall just have to hope for some serendipity of my own. ",Classic
50168, Let's see how them creatures like this stuff! ,Classic
161724, No! To us. ,Classic
1392, Su San. Stop that noise.   ,Classic
104753, Followed? What? ,Classic
92586," Of course it has. That's why I fell. Oh, I see what you mean. A deliberate trap, eh? ",Classic
41696," Stop! Stop! She-devil, wherever you are, call off these monsters. Spare us.   Oh, no! Oh, no! ",Classic
113379," What were you thinking of, Doctor? ",Classic
15238," Yes, I see. It's a difficult problem, isn't it? ",Classic
158808," Sorry. What about your chemistry A level, then? ",Classic
120974," I can't do that! What were you doing there, anyway? You were right in the middle of a launch and land window for commercial flights.",Classic
119141," No, Hermann, those two fools. ",Classic
33530, Hmm? ,Classic
54186, Yes. Gregory's bringing him now.   That'll be them. ,Classic
78984, Too late! ,Classic
24537, Doctor? ,Classic
49098, What panics? ,Classic
16163," Oh, my dear, you think I'm being callous do you? ",Classic
38885, I quite understand. ,Classic
61747," Well, his whole cardiovascular system is quite unlike anything I've ever seen. And I'm told his blood can't be identified. ",Classic
119620," Oh, must we go into vulgar threats? Let us just say that I shall destroy Paris, if that'll help you make up your minds. ",Classic
40864," Oh, we can't turn back now. ",Classic
126727, It's hard to tell with the motors in this state. About ten minutes. ,Classic
97013, You're getting it.   Who are you? ,Classic
53974," That's not a bad idea. Now, wait a minute, it'd be pitch dark down in those tunnels. ",Classic
136944, Shush. ,Classic
127196," Rumours, lady. The law permits it. ",Classic
15555," Of course. That is where we are strong, in our planning. ",Classic
13660," Yes, Heron. We will do as you say. ",Classic
31823, How accurate is it? ,Classic
160009," Yes, sir. Okay, men, follow me. ",Classic
149801, What? ,Classic
96995," I think you'd better go, Miss. ",Classic
104157," Yes, in concentrated form. ",Classic
46646, So if we could get ahead of them. ,Classic
21980, Please let me go! ,Classic
82863," Fire. Repeat, full power. ",Classic
87190, You're going to take them back to the past? ,Classic
103120," Doctor!   Doctor, you were right. There was a body. Two of the robots, they took it to a special place. ",Classic
110283, Reason dictates the Doctor is a traitor. ,Classic
39230, But I obey our masters. ,Classic
155325, Then for pity's sake tell us what it was that happened and enjoy your moment of triumph. ,Classic
128748," Doesn't matter, same thrust. ",Classic
90884, Everything secure? ,Classic
26176," So that's where you're hidin', Doc Holliday. ",Classic
94668," No, and I don't expect there will be. ",Classic
84646, Then why did you blow up the mine. ,Classic
73100," No! No, I don't want it!",Classic
55895, Leaving? ,Classic
63126," I must say, Brigadier, that I'm delighted that you didn't agree with him. ",Classic
12513, Good evening. Are you looking for somebody? Something? ,Classic
95760, Who? ,Classic
135701, You must delay them. I need more time. I must generate sufficient power for transfer. ,Classic
56225, Old times. Friendships don't die. ,Classic
112369, Unstoffe. ,Classic
45601, We just arrived. We were brought here. ,Classic
58167," Just about, sir. ",Classic
46164, Open? You sure about that? ,Classic
72378," Garvin the verger. We must we must get the police at once. Oh, oh, my name's Olive Hawthorne, by the way. How do you do? ",Classic
2670, Yes. ,Classic
57900," It looks like it, Zoe. ",Classic
57340, This is the Doctor. ,Classic
130589, Yes! ,Classic
121072," Well, I told you. I'm from Galactic. ",Classic
106876," I can't, I can't. ",Classic
112836," Captain, she does know. ",Classic
135429, You wanted to see me? ,Classic
165252, In the suitcase. ,Classic
113256, Then who? ,Classic
8006, Carol. ,Classic
50808," Hey, come on. Nearly ready? ",Classic
93223, Yes. ,Classic
85260," Jolly good. Right, now  Nancy and Benton dance together, Jo and Jones kiss and embrace.)   Ah, well, there you are, you see. ",Classic
156618," You, Mel, forget? A kangaroo never forgets. ",Classic
138140, All decks stand by. All decks stand by. This is a special announcement from Terminus Incorporated. ,Classic
103729, Help! Let me in! ,Classic
73528," On your feet, both of you!",Classic
54597, No. There isn't time to compute all the relevant information. They'd be on top of us by then. ,Classic
114989, I don't know what you're talking about. ,Classic
107365," He's as bad as she is. Here, what's a time fissure? ",Classic
115379," Where is Romana? You realise, of course, that Count Grendel will have to go into exile, but there's no reason then why you can't go into exile with him, is there? Where's Romana? ",Classic
138225," Valgard, we're all dying. Did Bor say anything before he entered the Zone? ",Classic
93104, We must keep the Kaled race pure. Imperfects are rejected. Some of them survive out there. ,Classic
29481," Aye, not only for the sake of your friends, sir, but for the sake of the whole village yonder. ",Classic
63549, Take him to my laboratory. We shall use this creature to destroy all its kind. ,Classic
87847, This planet is now under Dalek control. Our commands will be obeyed. Those who resist will be exterminated.,Classic
93477, (Mutos pounce on the Doctor. One lift a large rock to hit him with when he is tackled by Harry. Sevrin scared off the others. ,Classic
112246," You're wrong, witch. Death is standing right behind you. ",Classic
10943," Only on the surface, my friends. ",Classic
121062, Anyone else? ,Classic
87559," Tell me, what's the purpose of your expedition? ",Classic
119199," My dear, these are the people who stole it from me at the Louvre. ",Classic
7794," Yes, well, you just rest there quietly. Yes, we'll let him have all the crystal water he wants, and if his breathing gets febrile, artificial respiration. Now, sir. Your laboratory. And I only hope there's time to save him. ",Classic
156264, Don't go through that   Door. ,Classic
161695, I hope not. ,Classic
29871," I will have my way, sir! ",Classic
104924, How can you in the nineteenth century know anything of the fifty first? You lie! ,Classic
57763, What? ,Classic
114387," Oh, may I watch? You don't mind, do you, Doctor? ",Classic
81239, Claire. ,Classic
12291," Oh, I must get some fresh air. Yes, I want to have a talk with that child. ",Classic
37733, But anyone can go in there. ,Classic
51696," Hey, where's the bomb thing? ",Classic
159761, Ah. He specifically ordered that Ace remain here. ,Classic
25820, Now that ain't so. We're backing you. You make your play and we gun 'im down. Easy as skinnin' summer fries. ,Classic
99770, No. ,Classic
30887, I can't think. ,Classic
55777, Quick! ,Classic
93523," Well, there's the detention room down there.   Good. I'll meet you there as soon as I can. ",Classic
53590," They're being taken over to the Main Administration Building now, sir. ",Classic
34167, I want to talk to him. Can you take me to him? ,Classic
27191, I just came through that door up there. ,Classic
94701, We must evacuate the Beacon in three minutes. ,Classic
140033, I fear no hellhound. ,Classic
112939, But it's so cold. ,Classic
22218, And I thought you knew what you were doing. ,Classic
155984, What? ,Classic
163251, A non-stick bullet. ,Classic
45407, Well how the hell should I know? Is that thing working? ,Classic
149871, I think you'll feel a good deal sicker before we're finished here. ,Classic
131353, You weren't hurt? ,Classic
29967," Right, now's our chance. Down the tunnel. ",Classic
157492, Mel? Mel? ,Classic
66358, I don't need advice. ,Classic
160864, They're just for appearances. We always have a full house because attendance is compulsory. ,Classic
140218, I couldn't do better myself. ,Classic
52646," You sent for us, Master? ",Classic
157198," No visitors, no ball games, no fly posts, no visitors. ",Classic
141677, One last try.   Thank you so much. ,Classic
90551, We need more power. Concentrate! Concentrate! ,Classic
44967," Oh, Doctor! ",Classic
141696, Yes. But I'm not so sure it closed. ,Classic
38296, I'll look after him. ,Classic
22382," Tuthmos, a slaughter! I must fetch reinforcements.  (The surviving guards retreat to safety, taking Steven and Sara with them. Elsewhere, Chen emerges from where he's hidden during the fighting.",Classic
99188, You're as bad as Chase and the others. You want me to die! You want me to die! You want me to die! ,Classic
120577," Oh, my lady. ",Classic
20595, Cousin? ,Classic
135165, What's the matter with that? ,Classic
75507," Forward section here, sir. We're being attacked. ",Classic
17855," You know, Doctor, it looks to me as if it's sending some kind of message. What do you think? ",Classic
30466, You. ,Classic
110857, I've got an urgent appointment. ,Classic
27605," Now do you understand, strangers? We are masters. ",Classic
64540," Taltalian was under strict orders to make sure you didn't have access to the computer. You see, every astronaut is issued with an emergency code only to be used in the ultimate emergency. The code you've been trying to crack. The message we received from Mars Probe 7 told us that the deep space capsule had passed through a hitherto unsuspected high density radiation belt on its way back to Earth orbit.",Classic
158917, I see. That's a very interesting concept. ,Classic
106786," I don't suppose we could borrow K9, could we? ",Classic
88530, I need no advice from spies and saboteurs. ,Classic
125744, Courage. It will not fail. ,Classic
71576, A very resourceful young man. ,Classic
75382," My dear Doctor, I can walk out of here any time I choose. ",Classic
126156," Ahem, Doctor, can I have a word with you?   Have you got a death wish? ",Classic
135802," Silence, girl! ",Classic
31198, Then you did change! ,Classic
89193, Guard them.,Classic
35735, And the other men in there? ,Classic
23491, Listen to me! ,Classic
140599, Thank you. ,Classic
1764, I wonder if there's any point in reminding the Thals of what they used to be? ,Classic
73772," As you wish, Controller. ",Classic
60392, Of course not. Greater technological knowledge would be dangerous. ,Classic
116030, Why would he take that risk? ,Classic
122912, What is going on here? ,Classic
18676," They won't go after the Tardis anyway, Doctor. It's this ship they want, and us.",Classic
82556," The war is certain now. And once the great empires destroy each other, I ask but one thing. Let me rule the planet Earth in your name.",Classic
110162, Thank you. Thank you very much. ,Classic
25183," No, I'll take your word for it. Look, if you're real people, what are you doing here? And why are you wearing those ridiculous clothes? ",Classic
39946," Jamie and Mister Haydon. Mister Klieg, the Doctor and myself will make up the other party. ",Classic
100310," He's not been seen, my lord. ",Classic
155122, This way. ,Classic
6751," Of all Aztec men, the High Priest of Knowledge is the most gentle. ",Classic
31657," Yes. Danger! I shall be contacting Earth just as soon as radio communications have been restored.   You're my servant, are you? ",Classic
31341," Alien, yes. Very alien. Goodnight. ",Classic
145418, His creatures? Do you think he's using them now for gun-running? ,Classic
154033, Are you sure that's wise? ,Classic
102942," It's coming, sir. ",Classic
123338, What? It's too late. ,Classic
6620, Doctor? Doctor? ,Classic
67020," Oh, very philosophical, Doctor. Thank you very much, I knew you tried. All very cosy. ",Classic
130718," So, where do we go from here? ",Classic
130197, Tell him what? ,Classic
16725," Come on, Doctor! ",Classic
100176, Then what do you suggest? ,Classic
74761, All right then.,Classic
123855," Oh blast, here we go again. ",Classic
49365," All right. Come on, I'll introduce you to Billy Boy.",Classic
57222," Well, shush! It's a warrior. Hide! ",Classic
25799," Well, use your eyes, dear boy. Good heavens. ",Classic
92838, It was all I could do. It gave us more time. ,Classic
132696, Our fancy dress. Do you really mean it? We can keep them? ,Classic
41199, And those devil creatures would kill you. ,Classic
114074, You really think so? ,Classic
160310," Sorry, ma'am. ",Classic
124488," Easy, Varsh. You said it would be easy. ",Classic
48847," Doesn't make sense, sir. It must have been driven by something. ",Classic
164785, No shooting.   Has anyone seen us? ,Classic
128165," If I show this to him, will he know what to do? ",Classic
47636, Aye. Hey! I thought we were supposed to be prisoners? ,Classic
17583," What is the meaning of this, sir! What ",Classic
31651," But, but didn't you all hear what I said? The Daleks must be destroyed! ",Classic
9331, I've just found them. I don't want to lose them again. ,Classic
152180, So you decided to steal it. ,Classic
78407," No, no, no, hers. No, the Tardis's. ",Classic
74926," Vanishing ships, of course. ",Classic
1241, Yes. How are you feeling? ,Classic
152527, Has your instinct deserted you? The kill was too easy. ,Classic
8145, No. ,Classic
82798," You wait here, Doctor. Codal and I will scout ahead. We won't be long. ",Classic
67985, I knew it.,Classic
73406," It's all there in the paper in front of you. Why don't you take a look?   I'm sorry to disappoint you. By the way, that machine of yours is a bit antiquated, isn't it? Do you mind if I suggest some improvements and ",Classic
18307, I think I can drag my aged limbs in some sort of semblance of a run. Go on. ,Classic
46563, Yes. ,Classic
111686, Looks like a rough map. ,Classic
102773," Can I, can I come inside this time? ",Classic
137561, It must be on the ship. I'm a fool. I should have realised. ,Classic
131055, I'm sorry. I didn't realise it was going to be like that. ,Classic
119994," Immediately, my lady. ",Classic
139584, I've been looking for you everywhere. ,Classic
66418," The man was caught! He is no longer a danger to us. The people who sent him, how and why he came here, this information is vital. ",Classic
101897," Rassilon's discovery, all mine. I shall have supreme power over the universe. Master of all matter! Bwhahahaha!   Doctor, my congratulations. You're just in time for the end. ",Classic
101547," The assassin, according to you, being one of the High Council. ",Classic
156377, I find your incompetence more than enough without listening to your puerile opinions. ,Classic
3461, He did not return. ,Classic
2229, There's been a fall of rock. The way is blocked. ,Classic
43539," Disconnect it completely, now. Now we must move quickly, before the glacial surge does too much damage. ",Classic
41780,"   Jamie, there is something I have to do. ",Classic
51523, Exactly. ,Classic
37260, Well I'll go with Ben. ,Classic
87092," Yes, yes, yes, I'm fine, I'm fine. ",Classic
77084, Guard! Call the squad in. ,Classic
49027," Well, I was ill in the cabin, you see. A terrible fever. Raving for days. Well, when I came to, the door was closed against us, the Doctor was hurt and your people came. ",Classic
50450," Agreed, Navigator Rago. ",Classic
64829," Thank you, Doctor, but I don't think you realise just what's necessary. ",Classic
71185, Allen. ,Classic
112660," Well, the last two or three times, yes. ",Classic
32203," It is to the Daleks. They've conquered static, just as they've conquered anti-magnetics. ",Classic
113336," Yes, sir. ",Classic
51240," Well actually, now I come to think of it, if you were to take out one of the seats, a Quark might fit inside. ",Classic
3253, He's an important man. He's a special emissary of the great Mongol leader who has been at war with Kublai Khan. Tegana is to arrange a peaceful settlement between them. Would a man like that lie about walking in the desert? ,Classic
11729, They have. ,Classic
123731," The plants are. Lush, aggressive vegetation. ",Classic
44046," Yes, I can imagine that. ",Classic
45148," Yes, sir. ",Classic
157699," No doubt you've been allowing the Cleaners to kill off some of your people as well as the Kangs, for reasons which are at the moment beyond me but then I'm not a power crazed psychopath. ",Classic
95440, Distance? ,Classic
122125," Well, all right, if that's the way you want to play it.   Though how I'm going to mend the controls with my arms up in the air like this ",Classic
71145, Doctor! There's a message for you from the IMC ship. ,Classic
86806," That's a very ingenious theory, young lady. What does the Brigadier think about it, or the Doctor? ",Classic
95175," Who, the cyborgs? ",Classic
114564, I thought you were on my side. ,Classic
121360, When are we going to land? We've been stuck for ages. How much longer? ,Classic
143865," We shall be gone. I have a plan that will force Davros to leave of his own free will. Until then, you must supply him with everything he demands. Allow him access to the Space Station's laboratory. ",Classic
97974, What? Are you nuts? ,Classic
48276," I'm sorry to disillusion you, Jamie, but I don't think it was the punch that did it. ",Classic
163644, It's a surprise. ,Classic
8943," That is correct, citizen. As a matter of fact, you can see the prison from the end of the street here.   A wise choice, citizen. There is no finer set of apparel in all of Paris. ",Classic
126924," So this man's death was natural, you think? ",Classic
8334, I'm afraid that answer isn't good enough. ,Classic
123625, She's stopped breathing. The Generator is her only chance. ,Classic
120490," Yeah, you told us. Now shush. Let's get on. ",Classic
12749," That your excellency would be an impossibility. After such exquisite playing, I cannot presume. It would be out of the question. May I suggest that this instrument goes to your temple?   To the temple. ",Classic
63499, So now you expect us to send troops down there? ,Classic
154642," Get up, all of you. ",Classic
89636, Where did it go? ,Classic
38675, We had nothing to do with the death of that man. ,Classic
9318," I did not! The bed was hard, and the draught blew through the room like the north wind. ",Classic
52897, Two. ,Classic
22067," Oh, yes. And who is this? ",Classic
115889, Kroll! Kroll! ,Classic
162875," Right, I want an exclusion zone around the whole of the Carbury area, extending for one mile. One and a half kilometres outside the limit of radio jamming. ",Classic
151442, He must be dealt with. ,Classic
136289, I know exactly what you want. ,Classic
118770, And the Daleks want the same thing. ,Classic
3207," If he finds shelter, he'll be all right. ",Classic
149462, None at all? ,Classic
72202," Ah, you're going up there are you? It's all on telly, you know. ",Classic
158941," That's what I sold myself for, Kane's mark. I ought to cut my hand off for doing it.   Go on, then. Kill me! ",Classic
135536," Doctor. Doctor. You know where you are, Doctor? ",Classic
160593," Ah! A movable feast, eh? ",Classic
17010, No. No. ,Classic
52596," How very unfortunate.   I'm sorry to have to use violent methods, but you must submit. You have no alternative. ",Classic
90313, You are impertinent! I am going to help you. ,Classic
69857, What? ,Classic
111215," Oh, no. ",Classic
60075, Lecture? ,Classic
94098," Yes, just as I thought. ",Classic
79673," There are some things that even I cannot do, not alone, and at this point in my plans I need the help of a brother Time Lord. ",Classic
144892, Gullible idiot. ,Classic
150435," Good luck, everyone. ",Classic
134596," Of course not, but somewhere here there must be a control for these doors. ",Classic
164615, All right. ,Classic
42396," Well, I couldn't help thinking about it. ",Classic
88659, The Doctor thinks the rebels are going to try and capture the lance. ,Classic
16479, You search up there. ,Classic
22686, What happened? ,Classic
104178," Well, you had a few drinks with Mrs Gusset. Did she tell you anything further about the deceased? ",Classic
144751, No! ,Classic
156966," Let go of me, you interfering maniac. ",Classic
77102," As for this display of megalomania, how do you hope to conceal it from the Investigator? They are not all of them as loyal as those guards. Someone will talk, if only to save his own skin. ",Classic
155215,   What? are you certain? ,Classic
82229," Quiet! It's the same noise that I heard on the cargo ship. Doctor, it's the Ogrons! ",Classic
34265," Yeah, of course I do. She's one of our lot. ",Classic
54480," They'll arrive, Packer, they'll arrive. And when they do, there won't be one city in the entire world that we don't control. Think of it, Packer, the entire world! ",Classic
53479," We'll have to take that risk. Hold tight, here we go. ",Classic
59981, But they're all from different times.   We're landing! ,Classic
114871, What's the matter? ,Classic
139355," Hopefully, Turlough, hopefully. ",Classic
68390, What of it? ,Classic
39996, Insoluble? ,Classic
154376, Confess. ,Classic
127465, Come on. ,Classic
24410, Do you really think it'll work? ,Classic
140220, Brilliant. ,Classic
61153, They are all now concentrated in this one area. I have ordered the conventional troops to move in on them. ,Classic
26258," You come back here, and then we take over. ",Classic
63350, The creature is becoming aggressive again. ,Classic
106445, Leela? Why? Why Leela? ,Classic
153588, By order of the High Council. ,Classic
116187, What? ,Classic
19081, Of course. ,Classic
23945, How many more nights have we got to watch over this Huguenot's house? ,Classic
127994, Where are we going? ,Classic
128740, We thought he was in the Zero Room. ,Classic
164607," Oh, come on Philly, don't be such a baby doll. You should hear what they call her at school. ",Classic
35344," Ah, coffee. Splendid. Thank you, Polly. I think we could all do with a cup. ",Classic
67095," Yes, I have a headache, that's all. ",Classic
114643, Prove it. ,Classic
43829," Oh, I see. Well, it seems we have a problem on our hands whether to believe Mister Kent or not. ",Classic
141269, Forever cautious. ,Classic
99427," I was talking to the Doctor, the line went dead and those vines smashed the panes. ",Classic
6918," Grandfather, he's still warm. ",Classic
4017," Let me kill them, and be done with it. ",Classic
34283," Science? Ah, I see. One of Professor Zaroff's colleagues. Perhaps we should ask him to join us. ",Classic
162228," One way to find out.   That eye, I've seen it before. Of course, it was on the kites at the entrance hall. Fascinating. Somehow, somewhere down there is the answer to all that's going on at the Psychic Circus. ",Classic
66778," Sir, I'd, er, I'd like you to know that I objected to the order, sir. ",Classic
158480," Sometimes that sounds good, other times it's horrible. ",Classic
153164, I am trained only in installation and maintenance. ,Classic
91427, You see? They've operated the fail-safe mechanism. Give up now. Please! ,Classic
123073, He resents the fact that Hardin has found a better use for tachyonics than these Argolin games. ,Classic
98850, So what's to stop this breaking open like the other one? ,Classic
97009, Those are the first friendly words I've heard since I got here.,Classic
132011, Steady. You'll be all right. ,Classic
4102," Are you with the caravan, my lord? ",Classic
54461,"   UNIT control. This is the Doctor. Is the Brigadier there, please? ",Classic
78861, What happened to King Dalios? ,Classic
104816, That's all right. ,Classic
2539, Don't touch! ,Classic
31908, Where are they going? ,Classic
154388, But it was never like that. ,Classic
64749, Did you? Or are you involved with the people who are really behind this? ,Classic
13014," How dare you speak to me like that. My orders are to be carried out, otherwise your own life will be in danger.",Classic
57187, What do you want me to do? ,Classic
73565," Jo? Jo! Look, can't you do anything? ",Classic
153825," If I am doomed, then you are all doomed. ",Classic
67485," Look, if you've come down merely to be rude ",Classic
87241," Excuse me, sir, but, er, are we evacuating or not? ",Classic
122964, I don't think much of this Earth idea of recreation. Why can't we do something constructive? ,Classic
60666, Have you looked for this space time machine of theirs? ,Classic
141403, What do they use that for? ,Classic
60667, What use is that to us? ,Classic
87116, He's turned again. Heading into the trees. I've lost him. He's somewhere among those trees. Over. ,Classic
29980," My dear Captain, I had every intention of telling you. ",Classic
105488," You're right there, sir. We should have been going dead slow in them conditions. Weren't Captain's fault, neither. ",Classic
77610, Without him? ,Classic
8423, But it's all screwed up. They must have realised it was useless. ,Classic
28522, All War Machines must be disciplined. They must attack simultaneously. ,Classic
162447," Search, search, search for the truth. Search, search, search ",Classic
15710," I'm not so sure of that, my dear boy. Where did you say you'd left them? ",Classic
69066," If you've got any sense, just hand him over to me and the boys for an hour. We'll soften him up. ",Classic
143832, We don't know for certain. ,Classic
145923, Lost him? Why are you staring at me? Perhaps you think you recognise me? ,Classic
31117," Just look at Mondas, sir. I can't believe it! ",Classic
273, Kal? ,Classic
7139, I'll protect you. ,Classic
102712," They watch and control various parts of the ship, make sure everything's working properly. ",Classic
27387," Senta, this is the Doctor, the traveller from beyond time. ",Classic
7371, The conclusion being that they would contract in darkness. ,Classic
87661," Certainly, when the only alternative to living is dying. All right. Come on, let's get it over with. ",Classic
12302, Doctor? ,Classic
13760, Get ready.   Now! ,Classic
89294, Doctor! Thank goodness you've come. Eckersley has kidnapped the Queen. ,Classic
4956, It was just your imagination. ,Classic
122208, It's getting worse. ,Classic
8626, Look at these bundles. Bottles of wine. Bread. A bit stale. ,Classic
95505, It's huge! Where's the signal device? ,Classic
107660," Hmm? Oh, find a star about to go supernova and dump it in the vicinity. ",Classic
144270," It's all right, they're our Troopers. ",Classic
102991," Let's get this thing settled then. The sooner we get this worked out, the sooner we get back to making our quota. Scientists. I never should have let him on board. ",Classic
83437, Shush! ,Classic
7270," Well I don't know, Doctor. Certainly isn't here. ",Classic
92622, Then it was you following us? ,Classic
49706, I see. ,Classic
81993," It would explain a great deal. After the stupidity of the Draconian war, the bitterness eventually died down and we had many years of peace. There were trade treaties, cultural exchanges and then for no reason at all, these sudden acts of hostility. ",Classic
140734," And not humiliate me first? Oh, that isn't your style at all.",Classic
107937," This skin, it's real skin! ",Classic
21993, Have you checked it? ,Classic
29205," Oh, of all the bloomin' fixes to be in. ",Classic
115166," If he misses the appointed hour of his coronation, we must choose another king. That is the law. ",Classic
63243, What's that?   What are they doing? ,Classic
16255, I hope it suits him. ,Classic
33991, Doctor? Doctor? ,Classic
42796," Doctor, I've found something here that I think you might ",Classic
106755," If those antibodies can confer immunity, they can be used to attack the Nucleus. ",Classic
71602," Well, this is the last of our ",Classic
138315," Now it's your turn, only you I'm going to kill.   ",Classic
91739, And that thing you saw moving in the corridor. ,Classic
45940," Oh, does he? The plot thickens, doesn't it? I think it's time I got you two back to HQ. Lead on. ",Classic
76582," Once my people were farmers and nomads. Now look at them. Slaves in factories and mines. Already the pollution is causing mutations. The Mutts, as the Marshal calls them. Mutts! ",Classic
85596," By heavens, Linx, can you make me more of these? ",Classic
81138, You will remain here until the transporter arrives! The quarantine regulation on the conveyance of aliens is explicit. You will be taken to the thruster base in a transporter which we then be disinfected before further use. ,Classic
24255," Oh, I don't want to think it about it, dear boy. It's too horrifying. Though I must say that we're usually very healthy. ",Classic
36840, Now we can deal with you all together. ,Classic
17997," No. Nor do the Rills. There is no life on this planet. We come from Drahva. Some four hundred dawns ago, we were investigating this particular section of the galaxy. We were looking for a planet such as this, capable of supporting life so that we might colonise it. There are too many of us on Drahva. ",Classic
22192, The destructor is having no effect. ,Classic
131844, Why isn't he here? Why's he never around when you want him?,Classic
67522," Well, your telephone call was pretty intriguing, Colonel. Er, do sit down. ",Classic
114519, What? But why? The previous witness was attached to the assessor. ,Classic
45007," Oh, that's a dead end. It's a place I sometimes rest. It's very hard work, you know, bringing all this",Classic
32864," With proper care, yes. ",Classic
139132, Although some of it seems quite familiar. ,Classic
115511, One man alone? ,Classic
144920," Perhaps you doubt the efficacy of this device? Allow me to introduce the Tissue Compression Eliminator.   The same will happen to you, my dear, if you obstruct me. ",Classic
127875, Another Tardis. ,Classic
21684, Isn't that a rather a drastic way of dealing with things? ,Classic
29356, What trick's this?! ,Classic
150953, It's now a straight. Is that bad? ,Classic
1366, I had no chance. They're prisoners in the city. ,Classic
91860, She will revive soon. ,Classic
114894," On how we treat him, obviously.   So you're not a peasant. ",Classic
42367," Every decision is checked to eliminate risk of failure. Because of course, all decisions, all actions, must conform to the common good. ",Classic
70475, Not without the trigger mechanism. The particles will just go on and on accelerating. ,Classic
130307," Well, it could be the double helix. ",Classic
57679," Thirty minutes from beacon Alpha Three, sir. ",Classic
59580, Indeed we will! ,Classic
94513, The Cybermen hold the entrance. There's no way past them. ,Classic
162212," No. Oh, we should have made straight away for the open air, I suppose. ",Classic
65814, Are you some kind of idiot? ,Classic
66366," You have a bad record, Sutton, a long history. It would be very easy to have you disposed of. Remember that. ",Classic
61312," I've never really needed it before, Jamie, but this business of sending everyone back to their own times is, well, it's too difficult for me.   Now, come along. The War Chief! ",Classic
52414," Oh yes, that's the citadel all right. The question is, how do we get up there. ",Classic
95971, It's difficult to explain. ,Classic
97085," Look, what's going on? ",Classic
57965, How do you know the next section to this one is an opposite pole? ,Classic
76684, Stop or I fire! ,Classic
57547," So that's Ta, huh? ",Classic
62683, Or someone trying to cover up simple incompetence. ,Classic
3137," Well, I think we should say goodnight anyway. ",Classic
76760," No, I'm sorry, I can't go yet. ",Classic
47374, Creature? ,Classic
126339, Let us start her off at seventy. ,Classic
96810, The bulkhead release will be concealed. ,Classic
80018, There's a possible solution. I'll let you know as soon as I can. ,Classic
41648," Oh headstrong, that's what she is. ",Classic
159755, It was okay. You're late. ,Classic
36845, Silence! Silence the three strangers! That is an order! ,Classic
38457," That disposes of that. Now, this is extremely important. You did leave the matches? ",Classic
94757," What? Well, you'd better do something, old girl, and quickly. ",Classic
156314, You'll soon have ample scope to indulge in melodrama. ,Classic
127705, That's a good idea. I'm not having any luck here with it at all this morning. It's really very cold. ,Classic
141904," I would do as he says if I were you, Commander. ",Classic
7017," Well, we'll see about that. We'll see about that. Reading, please. ",Classic
53258, Yes. ,Classic
82233," Seize them, fool!   Bah! You idiots! Back to the ship, all of you! ",Classic
103829, Dask. Dask! You look ridiculous in that outfit. Not half the robot your father was. ,Classic
112501, Yes. ,Classic
63661," I know all about your different biochemistry, but we don't know if it makes you immune. Now roll up your sleeve. Come on. ",Classic
159066," Is a grain of sand important, Glitz? I must go back and consult my star charts on the Tardis. ",Classic
118389, Does that mean I can go? ,Classic
78439, Master! The other one is here. Your enemy is here. ,Classic
101141, Yes. ,Classic
117818, Drax? ,Classic
106481," You have two minutes in which to decide. Either give us the Doctor, or your Foundation will be wiped out. ",Classic
84279," Well, it's only about a foot deep. ",Classic
146834, Good. ,Classic
2108, I'm not going on. ,Classic
31871, We've been forgetting about Polly. ,Classic
115833, If there's a misfire then we have a manual override system. ,Classic
129376, Belts and braces. ,Classic
80475, Drashigs? ,Classic
80413,"   Yes, exactly. Historically speaking, this collection is a bit of a jumble, I must admit. ",Classic
89810, All praise to the Great One! ,Classic
85609, Who is this? ,Classic
48555," Well unfortunately no. No, we have to do battle with that ourselves. ",Classic
134463, Yes. Can't you feel it too? ,Classic
33136," All right you, come on. He's done for. ",Classic
154627, Simply as further evidence of the Doctor's interference. ,Classic
29443," And we'll take their store, find Avery's treasure, and this into the bargain. ",Classic
40548, What are those creatures? ,Classic
47940, Yes. Just tired. Is there any news of my wife? ,Classic
83021, Good. ,Classic
144295, Now!   Behind you! ,Classic
106452, What? ,Classic
10484," Yes, yes, I think I have. ",Classic
74617," All right, live, Grun. I would not kill the King's champion.   ",Classic
141638, What is it? ,Classic
153655," Oh, the Valeyard's charges. I always thought Valeyard meant learned court prosecutor. ",Classic
116308," No, no, no, no. Electrical storms on planetary satellites can be quite spectacular. ",Classic
91525," Hey, Doctor. ",Classic
105096," Now listen, Reuben. I've seen the inside of some of them old lighthouses ",Classic
137159, Look. It must have just returned. ,Classic
44564, Sometimes it's necessary. ,Classic
109480," What do you think, Jackson? ",Classic
145026," There was civil war on my planet. My mother was killed. My father was on the wrong side and was exiled here with my younger brother. I, for my sins, was sent by the regime to Earth. ",Classic
59911, Oh that is sheer incompetence! ,Classic
56087, Faster than light. ,Classic
11700," Only to put into position the penetration explosive. The charge is in the fissure capsule now. When positioned, the charge will strike the fissure in the Earth's crust here. ",Classic
131586," Well, someone who needs it to breathe properly. Let's find them.   I said, let's find them. ",Classic
24059, Goodbye. ,Classic
158762," You girl. Yes, you, girl. Come here. ",Classic
24972, Well? ,Classic
80510," Cover the aft companionway. Quick! Right, come on.",Classic
16178, Not yet. The elders are still discussing it. We have a half-sun in which to give them our answer. ,Classic
163105, Doctor!   ,Classic
113863," It's just that I can see a bicycle approaching, unless I'm very much mistaken. Over here! ",Classic
105963, Others? ,Classic
84299," No, there's no question of it, sir. This is now a security matter and UNIT's taking charge. My people will be arriving as soon as possible. ",Classic
16564, Afraid so. ,Classic
140055, He is not the King. ,Classic
124594," Well, of course you heard a noise.   Who are you? ",Classic
110170, Where are your guards? ,Classic
16968," What, do you mean the cable? ",Classic
105232, The generator? But he were always so careful. ,Classic
152090, I am aware that this product has eliminated famine from the galaxy. ,Classic
45154," Really? Well, we'll see. I'm not on my own this time. I've got friends here with me, and between us we're going to fix you once and for all. ",Classic
105149," Done it again, see? ",Classic
22655," Perhaps, yes. Perhaps one day. At the moment, I should say that he's had quite enough for us for a while. Having taken his directional unit, it will take him quite a time to make the necessary repairs to his ship. ",Classic
70821, So no one from your colony survived? ,Classic
45627, No sign of that Doctor bloke. ,Classic
108518, Good dog. ,Classic
94090," Voga. Voga. Planet of gold. Yes, it's all coming back to me now. ",Classic
10," Oh, it's one of the girls, Susan Foreman. ",Classic
158196, I'm determined to try and enjoy myself if I can. ,Classic
45376," Doctor, look at the scanner! ",Classic
118597," Yes, yes, yes, we've heard all that. The Daleks can do all that for themselves. ",Classic
10656," Perhaps, perhaps. ",Classic
69809, All right you boys. Go! ,Classic
91215, Great. ,Classic
29805, What is? ,Classic
150513," On the contrary. And thanks to the information you've just given me, I shall be back in time for the crucial battle. ",Classic
18625," Yes, you are. ",Classic
151716," Six, seven, seven. ",Classic
118411,   I was a civilian passenger on a space shuttle. The Daleks attacked. I was the only survivor. ,Classic
135388, Only that Colin was last seen there. ,Classic
1722, Yes. ,Classic
82040, I also believe there was a conspiracy to destroy this man because he's politically dangerous to you. ,Classic
50154," Oh, I see. How interesting. Yes, of course. And presumably your large spaceship holds your invasion fleet, and the smaller ships can only enter the Earth's atmosphere by homing on a radio beam. ",Classic
132229, Top hole. ,Classic
151989," You are a fool, Jobel. I have offered you immortality, but you are content to play with the bodies of the dead, so you will join the Doctor. ",Classic
23386," All the more reason why Elizabeth of England should send him. Find out more about this Englishman. Go now, and stay close to the Abbot. And Simon, tell him I shall bring word later concerning the Sea Beggar. ",Classic
105080," Not now, maybe. I told you, it went under the sea. ",Classic
127333, Their deaths will serve to deter others. ,Classic
25760, I do. The Toymaker wasn't playing. ,Classic
104877, What trickery is this? ,Classic
28652, But we can't leave now. We can't let that thing loose over London. ,Classic
93552, It's coming from over there. There's somebody in the ventilator shaft. ,Classic
154971, Mayday call? We have to respond. ,Classic
12297," My dear. My dear, why don't you come with us, hmm? ",Classic
51381, Saved? From what? What of the rest of our people? ,Classic
101074, Awaiting orders to activate automatic defence procedures. ,Classic
971," What, this? ",Classic
31133," Hello, Geneva? Geneva? ",Classic
13644, We had no choice. ,Classic
64407, They've locked it from the inside? ,Classic
742," I think you are from the other side of the mountains. If you show me how to make fire, I will take you back to the foot of the mountains. If you do not show me, I cannot stop you dying on the old stone. ",Classic
161614, How's the game going? ,Classic
79687," What are you talking about, Doctor? They're only just outside the building. ",Classic
127729," You mean we're going to measure Logopolis, too? ",Classic
83728, All good. How long has this been going on? ,Classic
134275, You're not serious! ,Classic
36630, Why not? ,Classic
13700, Go. ,Classic
88739," Yes, quite so, old chap, but still, we've got to think of first things first, eh? Come on, let's get on.",Classic
154427, We must make every effort to find the right head on the correct body. ,Classic
115365," Find another peasant who understands androids, no doubt. ",Classic
67171," Keep an eye on him, Brigadier. I think Central Control ought to know about this.",Classic
85207, More than anything else in the world. ,Classic
100794, Where'd he go? ,Classic
119055," Only thus is true progress ever made. You, as a scientist, should be the first to appreciate that. ",Classic
39665, Is that what you want me to do to the people of Earth? ,Classic
103312," You filthy, disgusting man and animal. ",Classic
137711," With this equipment, yes. ",Classic
156653, Yes.   When we discovered that sad skeleton.,Classic
78997," Well, that's just it. I don't know myself. You shouldn't have put us into time ram, Jo. In any case, I was just about to do it myself. ",Classic
107533, There are Fendahleen everywhere. ,Classic
93168, You were saying? ,Classic
76287, Doctor? ,Classic
42144, I'm fully aware of that fact. ,Classic
49745," What do they want, then? ",Classic
66019, What was all that business at Central Control? ,Classic
17458, A secret passage. ,Classic
154224, What? ,Classic
78546," Seven five, seven oh, six five, six oh, five five, five oh, four five, four oh, three five, three oh. ",Classic
57348, We're ready to test. ,Classic
117606," Oh, come on, Romana! I mean, if it affected the operators, no one would be able to use it. Even the Guardians would think of that. ",Classic
66962," Well, is it all right? ",Classic
48678," Nice to know you're back to normal, sir. ",Classic
36996," Oh, what happened to me? ",Classic
92579, What? ,Classic
164886, It's warm. ,Classic
10623, The same seed. ,Classic
22495," Well, he didn't say anything really. Nothing. There I was, trying to warn him of the Daleks and suddenly there I was in the sarcophagus. ",Classic
98661, That's horrible. Horrible. ,Classic
84902," No, we can't count on it. If they took it into their heads to move off into the country, we'd be in real trouble.   Ah, the Doctor. Well, Doctor, the bombing didn't work. ",Classic
48586, What about the weed's nerve centre at the Control Rig? ,Classic
50864," I don't know about robots, but something was attacking us, and with pretty sophisticated weapons too. ",Classic
100053," It is written that a blow will be struck against you here, in the palace. You must bring your guards here to protect your noble person. ",Classic
14058, There seems to be no end to it. Look out!   All right? ,Classic
121900, Affirmative. ,Classic
29982, I had no choice. My friends are in danger. ,Classic
2129," Ah, good girl. Now, just take it over there. That's it. Now, look out. ",Classic
30325," No, I know when he gave me the paper. Now you clearly know something more about the situation. Can you be more explicit? ",Classic
8861, Would we be here if we had? ,Classic
159963," If this place is so out of the way of the action, what are we doing here? ",Classic
3118, Do you ,Classic
103058," Well, I'm the Doctor, and that's Leela. I wonder if it's possible for us to speak to the person in charge? I'd like to thank him for saving our lives. ",Classic
128861, Blood. ,Classic
44490, Why? ,Classic
75009," Yes, to make sure there were no survivors. What are these markers here? ",Classic
102583," The tunnel's here. Right, come on. ",Classic
3364," We will stay here until tomorrow morning, no longer. Please tell the others.   What amuses you? ",Classic
60164, You realise we have saved your life? ,Classic
9122," ARegional Deputy visiting from our southern province, Citizen. And as the province in question is to be discussed, I thought the Citizen could make his report personally. ",Classic
109220," Well, how? There's no power source. ",Classic
59549," Oh, yes. ",Classic
102892," Well, not precisely, no. ",Classic
111991," Hey, wait a minute. Now, where is it.   A little hearing aid I planted earlier. It's on the same wavelength as Unstoffe's two-way. Unfortunately, it's got no call button. ",Classic
82372," Well, very soon we shall be landing. I think, Miss Grant, you had better prepare yourself for a long stay. I'm afraid it's not a very comfortable place, but as the old song says, 'Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.",Classic
156472, Watch out!   Now will you accept that I'm not your enemy? ,Classic
5372," You will die. If you will take my advice, you will find someone to speak for you at the tribunal. Do you know any body in the city? ",Classic
87415," Yes, well, of course he was mad. But at least he realised the dangers this planet of yours is in, Brigadier. The danger of it becoming one vast garbage dump inhabited only by rats. ",Classic
47681," She's very ill, Mister Robson. ",Classic
79728, I thought you'd have told me that. They're your manoeuvres. ,Classic
63045, Just as soon as Doctor Meredith says so. There's still a chance you may have concussion. ,Classic
61988," From what we can gather, you arrived last night in the middle of a shower of meteorites. ",Classic
32611," No, he wasn't, was he? ",Classic
70692," Well, worn out soil can be reclaimed, Doctor, as you well know. We should have had subsidence crops within the year. ",Classic
156069," Oh, indeed not. The Doctor's well matched against himself. One must destroy the other. ",Classic
96234," I just told you. I found it back there in the wardrobe. Why, don't you like it? ",Classic
158427, I wonder if you could help us. ,Classic
88269, And you think someone's trying to stop you getting it? ,Classic
45529, Any trouble at Charing Cross? ,Classic
121429," Doctor, I'm very sad to say that I think the drugs were smuggled on board my ship, and I'm pretty certain I know who it was. ",Classic
148681, But I'm fine now. ,Classic
40398," Oh, about an hour. ",Classic
56787, Activate! ,Classic
67951," Doctor, please. ",Classic
157661, But Mel. ,Classic
46382," Ah, Doctor. Miss Travers is feeling all right now and would like to see you right away. ",Classic
89737," You know, this is barmy. Here am I, calmly discussing fabulous planets with blue moons, giant spiders, magic crystals, as if I was talking about er, pussycats, fish and chips and the Liverpool docks. ",Classic
79572, What? ,Classic
30823," Well, I've got this knife. ",Classic
122292," No, Lord Nimon. We have very nearly fulfilled our half of the contract. The condition of our ships makes it difficult for us to attack Aneth. If you would advance us a little of that technology you have promised us, we could complete our agreement and claim reparation from Aneth for both of us. ",Classic
25984, Gimme that book. ,Classic
15118," Yes, of course we can, Vicki. ",Classic
19618," Unless you learn to live together, there is no future for you on Refusis. ",Classic
153218, Take this.   Lead the young men on a hunting party. They must not escape!,Classic
107524, Come on. Come on. It's too late. You've seen her eyes. ,Classic
89537," Oh, er, yes. Yes, thank you. Most pleasant. Well, after a bad start, that is. ",Classic
149814," Whoa, there. Steady now. Quiet, boy. Easy. Shockeye will not hurt you.   Oh, we are wild, aren't we? ",Classic
107399," The fifth planet's a hundred and seven million miles out and twelve million years back, so we've no time to lose. ",Classic
11913," And you know how the ship has a faint sort of trembling while we're moving? Well, I suddenly realised that it had stopped. ",Classic
130886," Obedience, obedience, obedience. ",Classic
77840, He's coming round. ,Classic
4303," That's not too bad, so far. ",Classic
35155, I don't understand it. I'm sure there's a lack of co-ordination somewhere. ,Classic
133493, This could be it. ,Classic
24145," Yes, exactly! ",Classic
158291," Well, there are a couple of beauty spots in the area we could try. And also a few special places only known to Billy and me. ",Classic
108641," Oh, we'll pay no more taxes, brother. The Gatherer's got his last talmar off of us. ",Classic
165313, You don't understand. You don't know why you were selected for this mission. ,Classic
144667," Peri, be reasonable. Without the comparator, you will never return to Earth. Do you wish to stand here till the planet's destroyed? Well? Answer! ",Classic
165354," It's not true, believe me.",Classic
85177," Don't listen to this machine. You're the one in control. Fight it! Look at this crystal. Look at it. Look deep into the blue light. Look at it. Look at it!   Look at it. Look at it, Stevens. Look deep into the blue light. Look at it. ",Classic
132359, I don't think I could do it. ,Classic
65365," Well, I don't blame you.   Ah, there they are. ",Classic
69866," Axonite is, shall we say, the chameleon of the elements. It is a thinking molecule. It uses the energy it absorbs, not only to copy but to recreate and restructure any given substance. ",Classic
61085," Aye, all the resistance leaders are with us. ",Classic
2378," What are you up to, Susan? ",Classic
101913, Sir? ,Classic
38896," Now, Arthur, please. You must forgive him, Mister McCrimmon. ",Classic
54035, Where's Jamie and Zoe and Isobel. ,Classic
119482, You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs. ,Classic
79044," Jo, would you condemn anybody to an eternity of torment? Even the Master? ",Classic
105955, I carried it up from the service room. It looks like a kind of mortar. ,Classic
8756," You saved me, my boy, so I must rescue them. Now you can understand that, can't you? ",Classic
81625," Sooner or later, you're going to tell them everything. They'll use the mind probe. You talk to them now. You'll save yourselves a lot of trouble. ",Classic
98596, Hmm? ,Classic
56343, Continue the search. He must not escape. ,Classic
58846," It's a woman's voice, sir. Very faint. I'll put it through the amplifier. ",Classic
36773," Oh, it's all right. I've just come in to have a word with my old friend, the Pilot. Good morning, Ben. I hope you're feeling more your old self? ",Classic
70816," Er, we'd better get moving.",Classic
47489," Yes, sir. ",Classic
12799, We must give him some sort of incentive. ,Classic
110629, Hmm.   It might just work. Give me your helmet. ,Classic
4037," Marco, you must give us back the Tardis. ",Classic
87830, Such as? ,Classic
85138, Makes no difference. Nobody's getting in. ,Classic
78213," Oh, you've got me there, I'm afraid. ",Classic
145809," A man in my position, I have sources all over the world. It is of course only a whisper, but I think it would be wise to act with caution. ",Classic
101880, It's gone. ,Classic
76581, I don't know. It's rather a long time since I left Earth. ,Classic
94173," Harry, stop it. Anyway, it isn't ours. ",Classic
37257," No, that's true. You could investigate the hangar. ",Classic
66260," You idiot! If I don't repair this computer, you'll all be blown",Classic
110927, Isn't that important to you? ,Classic
6742," Yes, I gave it to him.   Ian was helping the handmaiden to escape. He struck you down from behind. ",Classic
120584," Guard, hold her. And make sure the dog's pointing against the rock. Where does the passage lead? ",Classic
125123, From spiders to marsh creatures and beyond. ,Classic
165526," When is a cat not a cat? When it builds its own cat flap.   Bait, Ace. Bait. ",Classic
5328, I'm going out the back way. ,Classic
155627, Isn't that obvious? We're running into turbulence. ,Classic
85443," It's a rhondium sensor. It detects delta particles. At a preset spectrum density of fifteen ams, it oscillates this little cylinder there, which promotes a vacuum in there which wakes me up. Clear? ",Classic
61341," Because when I send this box to them, they'll know where I am. ",Classic
96920, I don't understand it. ,Classic
151184, Peri. ,Classic
112813, Time travel? You expect me to believe such nonsense? ,Classic
17167, IDBI. ,Classic
110752," Well met, Leela. ",Classic
34651," Emergency, power network control. ",Classic
68103," Hello, Doctor. Is that you?",Classic
21447, Someone's opened the door! ,Classic
31475, Ahem. ,Classic
161049, Susan Q. Who taught you to shoot like that? ,Classic
73825," Then, who does? ",Classic
99951, Doctor! Doctor! Argh! ,Classic
40341, That's just it. They're down there now. ,Classic
118438, Yes. ,Classic
26966, The Traveller? You mean the Doctor? Is he all right? ,Classic
90837," Hello. You know, it's awfully good of you to allow this visit, Director. ",Classic
7873," Where are you going, Doctor? ",Classic
47055, No! ,Classic
40268," Jamie, come back. ",Classic
15539," Well, they need time to dodge the guards. ",Classic
113719, I thought you told me Earth was civilised now. ,Classic
152971, Yes. ,Classic
13005," I understand, Caesar Nero. ",Classic
69251," Right, come on. ",Classic
144561, Decide. ,Classic
96577," There are some humans here who have eluded the servicers. If work on the missile is delayed, they can be found and destroyed. ",Classic
31916, About time. This work should have been completed long before this. ,Classic
90997," You know, you need an inside man. ",Classic
39120," But sir, I ",Classic
141000, That's it. ,Classic
1791," No good. I've tried everything I know. They just won't risk a fight with the Daleks. The trouble is, I can't go too far. ",Classic
79108," Tell me, Professor, is this machine of yours functioning properly? ",Classic
79720, Doctor! Look. ,Classic
2385," Goodbye, Dyoni. ",Classic
71784," Yes, I had rather gathered that. ",Classic
8843," At once, citizen! ",Classic
154817, Have you seen Peri? ,Classic
28168," A sort of high pitched hum. It's gone again now. I'm all right, really. ",Classic
59899," Yes, Jamie. Now, it's very simple. Put the gun on the table. You can keep your hand on it again if you like! Now, watch.  LÜ ",Classic
165475, I got lucky on the fruit machine. ,Classic
90168, She's not here. ,Classic
153327, Silence! You drain my energy reserve with your constant infantile bickering.,Classic
122173," Don't you play the fool with me, Doctor. ",Classic
116576," To test a theory. All theories have to be tested sometime, and this seems as good as any. You stay here in case I'm wrong. ",Classic
85639," Yes, and very nearly blind. ",Classic
22657," Well, I'm not certain. It's a Mark four, remember. There are two possibilities. One, it would work. ",Classic
54405," Yes, sir. ",Classic
95691," Let's go, shall we? ",Classic
148958," Sorry. What are we doing here, anyway? ",Classic
104833," I say, Jago, look at this. ",Classic
81563, But we haven't done anything! ,Classic
87748, What else have you agreed? ,Classic
96187," Doctor, look. The hatchways are going. ",Classic
98558," Have you any idea what it can be, Doctor? ",Classic
133607," We are under attack, Adric. ",Classic
74157, I accept your Majesty's assurances. ,Classic
9652, I certainly will not! I want my granddaughter out of that prison! ,Classic
102151, What? ,Classic
26046," You don't need guns to sing, Mister Regret. I'll hold 'em for you. ",Classic
127952," Well, not just a Time Lord by himself, but with some of the powers of the Keepership still lingering. Huh, and I was so sure. I was so sure. He must have known I was going to fix the chameleon circuit. ",Classic
32006," You haven't been building Daleks, have you? ",Classic
155875," No, my lady, but I would point out that much of the Railyard's so-called evidence was a farrago of distortion which would have had Ananias, Baron Munchhausen and every other famous liar blushing down to their very toe nails. Much of the evidence was not as I remembered. ",Classic
86357," But, but those things died out millions of years ago. ",Classic
36103, No. Look out there. ,Classic
72480, We've found out who's at the bottom of all this. It's the Master. Over and out.,Classic
107375, If I can. ,Classic
1940," Yes, I see what you mean. ",Classic
32685," Well, you can't kill us in cold blood. ",Classic
109940," In short, Earth, twentieth century. ",Classic
138276, Are you doctors? ,Classic
48659," Go out like a light, eh? ",Classic
142655, It's a meteorite storm. ,Classic
38665, The date? ,Classic
82945, It should give them quite a headache. ,Classic
78497," You've noticed. Well, well, well. ",Classic
44599, Kent! Why don't you just let us in. It'll save so much unpleasantness.,Classic
139053, Are you all right? ,Classic
92803," Oh, hang on, old thing.   I can't get in. ",Classic
132285, How do you do? ,Classic
22000," No, I sincerely hope not. ",Classic
139479, The stateroom is this way. ,Classic
132114, Got it! ,Classic
15530," We are a slave race. When we grow older we are taken to other planets. Sita, Dako and myself were due to go. That is why we hide here and plan. ",Classic
128568," I don't know. I can feel it isn't going to be as smooth as on other occasions. Sooner we get to this Zero Room place, the better, eh?",Classic
50815, Oh I'm not sure. They feel impractical. ,Classic
164937, We must tell Commander Millington. ,Classic
84737, Keep me company? Make some coffee? ,Classic
85792," Well, he says he wasn't serving Irongron, and there is another stranger at the castle. Someone called Linx. ",Classic
117451," I don't know. I've never seen him do that before. That doesn't mean to say, of course, it isn't normal. ",Classic
118604, Get under cover. I'll try and lead them off. When I get clear I'll get to the ship as soon as I can. ,Classic
6026," Get out of my way. Go on. Let me pass. I must talk to Yetaxa.   Susan, please go outside and don't let anybody in. ",Classic
148206, Before he rebelled against orders. ,Classic
11875," No, David!   I've lost my shoe. Oh David, I do love you! I do, I do, I do!   Grandfather! ",Classic
108644," All right, Mandrell. I know. K9's got it covered. ",Classic
162910, Which way does that wall face? ,Classic
154453, He sounds hungry. Don't blame him. So am I. I'm famished. ,Classic
33525, I wonder what that information would be worth? Now let me see. ,Classic
100737, What? ,Classic
147065," I said, shut up. ",Classic
121455, Romana. ,Classic
95354, I thought the plan was to conquer the world. ,Classic
153951," No, but pink water. ",Classic
50200, Jamie! ,Classic
55913, Take up your positions. ,Classic
2271," Yes, I have it here. ",Classic
41162," Now, why has it stopped? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. ",Classic
20404, What was that? ,Classic
121181, I. Bushwhacked! ,Classic
151575, What happened? I don't believe anyone looks like you by design.,Classic
13863," Well, what would have happened if the spearhead had been successful? ",Classic
114522, Demand? ,Classic
120326, I thought you weren't going to come. ,Classic
110957, Of course there are no new orders. Stop him! ,Classic
6928," No, on the left. ",Classic
46194," Well, tell Captain Knight to start, will you? ",Classic
81256, What about the Doctor? ,Classic
70627, All right. ,Classic
112245, We shall not reach him. I see death standing between us. ,Classic
39999," But take this mathematical sequence, for example. I'm really no nearer to it's solution. I've tried every possible combination. You'd hardly call that easy! ",Classic
27883," Yes, I am here, Jano. We were expecting you.   Tell your people they are quite safe, Chal. Jano comes as a friend. ",Classic
133637, The shield is now soft enough. Break through. ,Classic
8586," Oh, nonsense. Let's have a word with the boy. Now look here, my boy. Hold still ",Classic
56039, Complete power phase blank. ,Classic
82584," Well, that's fascinating. ",Classic
149606, But what's to stop them materialising at the other end of the village? ,Classic
152645, Take out the eyepiece. ,Classic
75526, You told me it was enemy agents. Why didn't you tell me the truth? ,Classic
1301, They are asking for water. ,Classic
78760," You are a philosopher, friend. ",Classic
105089, On this rock? Not till my three month is up. ,Classic
146993," Well, this looks more like it. ",Classic
47842, In Mister Robson's cabin. It might have attacked him. He was in a wild state when I went in and just run out. He hasn't been seen since. ,Classic
73157," You will be sure that nobody disturbs him, won't you? ",Classic
111493, A great deal less than the ten million opeks you're asking. ,Classic
93046," You won't get any medals for being stupid, General. In fact, you won't be getting any more medals for anything. ",Classic
89412," Oh, very well.   I can't, I can't keep it up. ",Classic
69963," About which side you're on, you mean? ",Classic
62609, Astonishing. It's quite astonishing. ,Classic
142019, I said you wouldn't succeed. ,Classic
165873," Stay out of this, Ace! ",Classic
64274, Do you realise the importance of it? ,Classic
136111," How about you, sir? Madame, step this way, if you'd be so kind. I invite you to take the most exciting journey of all. The voyage inside. The journey to meet yourself. I address you in the silence of your own hearts. I offer my personal challenge. Dare you bare witness to what the Mara shows? Will you gaze upon the unspeakable? Dare you come face to face with the finally unfaceable? Children half price. ",Classic
126096," Come on, Doctor. We've got to do something. ",Classic
96093, Prepare to eject. ,Classic
77910, The crystal of Kronos. So I am right. ,Classic
10159," What did you expect, hysterics? I've seen more death than you could imagine. People dying of starvation all over the world. What do you think I started on research for? What puzzles me is how cool you are. ",Classic
105760, Yes. ,Classic
39461, They're taken us somewhere. Is that what you mean? Away from your house? ,Classic
38308," I don't know, but that's what we're going to find out. Come on!",Classic
108001, See how she begs for a gently death for you? So full of love and compassion. ,Classic
136535," He should be grateful. Was there something else, Chela? ",Classic
115462," You know, you almost have to admire the man. ",Classic
5425," Yes, we shall need every minute of that. Now, we must all take a task on. Murder, I gather, is very rare here. Now, I want both of you to go to the library and find out all the case histories you can. Facts and figures. ",Classic
103137, Why did you kill him? ,Classic
112548, What? ,Classic
2537, That's what I came to tell you both. He's decided that the only fault can be outside the ship. He's gone to turn on the scanner. ,Classic
154757," Well, we'll find Perpugilliam of the Brown on the way. ",Classic
30631," Yes sir, it's. There are hundreds of them, sir! ",Classic
116445, Kroll has turned upon us. It was his punishment for letting the dryfoots escape. ,Classic
87975, Sarah! ,Classic
143819, You all right? ,Classic
156614," You should know the answer to that, Mel. Didn't CPSnow expound on thermodynamics? ",Classic
758," Za is letting them go away, just as the old woman set them free. ",Classic
8666, The soldiers! They've found us! ,Classic
118326," Doctor, look out!   Doctor! ",Classic
29673," Who did, then? ",Classic
17492, Ha! Hooray! ,Classic
101618," I'm sorry, so sorry. ",Classic
150426, We have to find a way of getting into that hacienda without being detected. ,Classic
8932," All right, Susan. It's all right. ",Classic
115374, Do I need one? ,Classic
164926, Stop! ,Classic
45051," A dozen, eh? Will you tell me why thirty people are catered for here?",Classic
36320," He has another report, Pilot. An urgent one. ",Classic
54037," Yes, sir. ",Classic
3658," For the past three days, I have followed the course of the Yellow River as it flows north to the small town of Sinju, which lies nestled against the Great Wall.",Classic
4090," Very good advice, Marco.",Classic
111086," But, but I'm not an engineer, sir. I ",Classic
65248, He's been murdered. ,Classic
114409, How do you know? You haven't heard my case yet. ,Classic
82758," Oh, only three left. ",Classic
43620, You're wrong! You're wrong! We'll all be killed! ,Classic
2505, Coming. Coming.   Are you all right? ,Classic
111204, You go on. I'll hold them off. ,Classic
107685, Gatherer Hade is waiting for the death taxes. ,Classic
108957, He's one of them! ,Classic
96774, Scarman? ,Classic
90647," I will not be silent. I've listened to you for too long. To think that I've lost my chance of power through a spider! A spider that I could crush underfoot, without a second thought. A spider! ",Classic
106571, I can sense danger. ,Classic
9272," I'll share one drink, then I must start my journey. ",Classic
97332," Launch countdown commences in sixty minutes, Styggron. ",Classic
72227," It's of no importance. Well, Girton, you've done very well, but why aren't you ready? ",Classic
68525, Shall I go and check on his medical record? ,Classic
105974, It's like a laser beam but much more destructive. ,Classic
21747, I'll see how Steven is.   I think the effect's wearing off. ,Classic
154021," Oh, what a pity, huh? ",Classic
3545, What are you doing here? ,Classic
24876," Don't ask questions, child. There isn't time. Turn on the scanner. ",Classic
151958, We'll do our best for you. I'm sure Vogel can engage in a little creative accountancy on your behalf. ,Classic
153049, Ah. ,Classic
52316," As I always believed it would someday or other, my fortune to do. ",Classic
18965," Segment? To use your phrase, sir, what segment are we in now? ",Classic
12506," It's a lonely stretch of road. Maybe he was set upon by robbers? They did happen in this time, didn't they? ",Classic
70270, What else can we do? ,Classic
142538, He used to be a man of honour. Played the war games in the way they were intended. ,Classic
48685, Do you know what the Doctor's just gone and done? ,Classic
54388, Yes. Can you make sector five? ,Classic
93893," For the last time, I am your creator! You must, you will obey me! ",Classic
115992, I hate underground passages. ,Classic
132062, I can't make head nor tail of this. ,Classic
134656, It didn't. That's why it deflected your attack. ,Classic
14470," Oh, I think this whole thing is ridiculous. ",Classic
31005," Worse? We're just about to be blown to bits along with the entire population of the Earth, and you talk about something worse? ",Classic
108377," Erased, Excellency? ",Classic
39324, Jamie. ,Classic
44486, One move. Just one move.  ,Classic
53709," Good. Now listen. Your friends in the UNIT groups has been causing trouble. They must be stopped, understand? ",Classic
125645, Possibly. ,Classic
60481, What happened? Where am I? ,Classic
128033," Yes, all noted down. Monitor, I don't wish to press you but my problem is now extremely urgent. ",Classic
39949," Oh, rubbish. We can make a party. ",Classic
135435," Then you may withdraw. But be sensible, Doctor. If you try to lose yourself in the corridors of the Tardis, my men will hunt you down, and your death will be far from dignified and painless. ",Classic
80788," How, indeed? The eradicator is powerless against their Scope. That is why one suggests, in order to save face, that the Lurmans be deported together with their machine. ",Classic
73671, Only the weak will die. Inefficient workers slow down production. Obey the Daleks. ,Classic
78427, Right. B squad round the block. Keep your eyes open ,Classic
87944," Yes, that's right. They got this far then they couldn't pass the next intelligence test. ",Classic
111737," Scringe stones, lost mines. I was sweating blood listening to that junk. ",Classic
99254, I think not. The debt for my picture was a splendid excuse. ,Classic
115854," What? Oh, I don't know. Just curious. ",Classic
108901, Huh? ,Classic
132569, An Indian? ,Classic
138777," No, our power's being tapped somehow. ",Classic
35487, They will be disposed of. ,Classic
116385," You know, I don't particularly like the Swampies, but I can't say I really hate them. ",Classic
18449, You can't escape. Give up and we will not harm you. ,Classic
161636, All will be mine. ,Classic
65959, Professor! Come quickly! ,Classic
119498, Precisely. ,Classic
77014, Message reads. Unscheduled Hyperion space shuttle now on course Solos. ETA twenty two twenty twenty nine Solos time. Earth Council investigator on board. ,Classic
81001," Well, since none of you can remember more than about ten minutes ago, how do you know?   Can't you remember shooting the monster about twenty minutes ago? ",Classic
10441," Yes, I'm fine. I told you, I haven't eaten for ages. I think that's what it must be. Don't make a fuss. ",Classic
25767, Then your battle with him will never end. ,Classic
76735, I'm delighted to hear it. Come on then. ,Classic
124473, Doctor. ,Classic
133367, Look at the state they're in. ,Classic
142458, Tain't funny. She were screaming. ,Classic
100591, Now what is it you want? ,Classic
91433," We've done it, Harry. We've done it! ",Classic
106950," Well, not exactly. By the look of him, he didn't die easily. ",Classic
31676," You just used your brains, that's what you did. The Daleks are the most important thing. ",Classic
29515," Squire, you're being a fool. These men are villains. ",Classic
49421, I'll find someone else to keep me company. I'd hate it if you didn't have a sense of humour.,Classic
115593," Well, you've done it for the last time. ",Classic
53982," Well, you're a young woman. This is a job for my men. ",Classic
122442," Oh, I've seen similar things here and there. ",Classic
56795, Switch the air conditioning to expel. ,Classic
54328," Yes, Jamie, I rather gathered that. Is everyone else all right?",Classic
68120, What about them? ,Classic
132895, Hundred million years or so. They seemed so secure and yet they died out virtually overnight. ,Classic
84022, Eh? ,Classic
130534, Your friend had a sudden change of heart. ,Classic
124752, Oh! K9.,Classic
18429, Why can't I see you? ,Classic
50297, Trouble? ,Classic
66453," First you try to bully me, and then you switch on the charm. Secret police routine seven stroke four. ",Classic
72447, You saw the Devil? ,Classic
97421, How long before we start all this? ,Classic
69006, Huh! ,Classic
136281, Tegan! ,Classic
38641, Why make an appointment to see us at ten? ,Classic
25148," No, Steven, don't. ",Classic
4677," Doctor, there's blood on this strap. That means she's hurt, maybe badly. We can't argue now. Let's get inside. ",Classic
127055, No! No! No! Argh! ,Classic
13204, Dragged down? To what?  ,Classic
144685," Doctor, we accept your offer of help. ",Classic
114113, Hurry! ,Classic
146688, Not in detail. So far they've simply worked to orders. ,Classic
34270, They were going to turn me into a fish. ,Classic
53802," Some old friends of ours are here, Zoe. ",Classic
34855," You don't expect to land us on the moon and let us fly off just like that, do you? ",Classic
87603, Daleks do not require the co-operation of inferior creatures. ,Classic
103170," She murdered him, didn't she. ",Classic
26984," Ah, there you are, both of you. Well, I don't think I was so far wrong, my boy. What do I look like, my dear? ",Classic
53668, Come on! Get up there after them! Quickly! ,Classic
87876," Yeah, that's what they said about the Peruvian temple as well. Yes, it's one of Earth's great mysteries, that no primitive man could possibly have built such a structure. Well, now we've solved it. ",Classic
104579," Honourable gentleman please to bring cards to stage. I have further demonstration requiring nerves of steel.   I will now ask my eager volunteer kindly to step into the Cabinet of Death.   The bird has flown. One of us is yellow.   If you will now pay close attention, ladies and gentlemen. ",Classic
109443," We could try a rush. Well, we must do something. ",Classic
5838, That's what I call really knowing your subject. ,Classic
92751," Yes, don't you worry about it, old chap. He's half demented with shock. ",Classic
2769," We have five minutes only. When the end does come, they won't know anything about it. ",Classic
148838, What have you got there? ,Classic
139063, Electronics. On an Edwardian racing yacht. ,Classic
47643, There is something down there blocking the impeller. ,Classic
18718, We've driven them off. ,Classic
160585, Depraved. ,Classic
109951," May I go also, President-elect? ",Classic
773, Yes. I remember how the meat and fire joined together. ,Classic
96874, Ah. So the Eye of Horus was still holding Sutekh for two minutes after it was broken. ,Classic
138156," Look at them. I doubt if they can feed themselves, let alone fight. ",Classic
74389, Was the face of Aggedor revealed to you? ,Classic
98995, Base? ,Classic
49281, Leo! ,Classic
124525, He believes all that stuff ,Classic
100563, I'll do it. ,Classic
130939," Look, was what we just saw the future or the past? ",Classic
90665," I've brought you the crystal. Now why don't you just take it and leave the humans in peace, both here and on Earth? ",Classic
45147, Of course it doesn't make sense if you haven't got any sense. Just stand guard and try and keep your wits about you. ,Classic
39305, Now you leave them to us. Take Ruth Maxtible with you. She's waiting for you at the stables. ,Classic
142491," It takes time. Excuse me, Colonel. ",Classic
3503," Grandfather, you'll never find it on your own. Come on. ",Classic
13455, Watch her. ,Classic
103264," It's all right. Relax, Toos, relax. ",Classic
75215," You'll just have to patrol the area, won't you? ",Classic
66612," You still have a job to do here, Sutton! ",Classic
124417, But the clock says ,Classic
134422, What? ,Classic
144021, Who knows? It defied every test I could think of. ,Classic
64201, What's the minimum time for blast off? ,Classic
148581," Oh, something's happening to my arms. ",Classic
6153, Perhaps. ,Classic
127238," Forgive me, Seron. ",Classic
40331," What do you mean, special trap? ",Classic
40455, Yes. ,Classic
24676, But his report of conditions on the planet Refusis started favourably. ,Classic
101099," The question is, can I make this regenerator work? ",Classic
78180," Well, it's true. You and Benton and Doctor Ingram, well, you were, you were stuck. ",Classic
3433," Oh, good. ",Classic
118956," Discreetly, sir? Sell a Gutenberg Bible discreetly? ",Classic
152252, I didn't make him drunk! ,Classic
52825, We'll find out later. Keep down. ,Classic
155295, Seventy two hours closer to getting expert investigators on board. Carry on. ,Classic
13548," Tell us, Doctor. What happened? ",Classic
158242," I've found her. Repeat, I've found her. ",Classic
47261, I'm sure I put it in here this morning. I must have left the file on my desk at home. I'll go home and get it. ,Classic
127412," Yes, I can see there's something in that. Adric, put your mind to that. ",Classic
130875, What do you want? ,Classic
82818, That's a pity. ,Classic
53962," Yeah, but what about that one? You can't let it roam down there alone! ",Classic
11372, What's the point of that? He just threw his life away. It was so senseless. ,Classic
152879, No. I've seen enough. I'll wait you at the entrance. Where they used to sell candy bars and newspapers. ,Classic
135551," Colin could be behind there, hurt. ",Classic
51201, You are fortunate that I still have need of your services. You will supervise work on the drilling site and make sure that nothing delays the task. ,Classic
36441, All right. All right. Forget it. I prefer Control poisoning my lungs to their trying to poison my mind. ,Classic
128779, We must get him straight back to the Zero Room. ,Classic
94341, They're docking! ,Classic
14863, That's terrible. Can't we tell him? ,Classic
61581, Not entirely. We have noted your particular interest in the planet Earth. The frequency of your visits must have given you special knowledge of that world and it's problems. ,Classic
143681, Soon. ,Classic
72665, What's Captain Yates up to? He'll kill the lot of them. ,Classic
90572," Yes, well, I had to get away. I hadn't your power.  K' ",Classic
66054, Excellent! At last he's done what he was told. ,Classic
73743," Don't be stupid, man! ",Classic
152757," That is noted. Doctor, why did you go to Ravalox? ",Classic
84062, Our boss. Yours and mine. ,Classic
81648, These men are your servants. They are saying what they have been ordered to say. ,Classic
74974," I've just been plotting the sightings of the three sinkings. There, there and there. And it's interesting that right in the middle of them, there's this abandoned sea fort. ",Classic
110989, Take that for me. ,Classic
111112," Yes. Sontarans, Daleks. ",Classic
109408, He is ready. ,Classic
155463, Doctor! This court is dedicated to giving you a fair trial. Do not abuse its indulgence. ,Classic
138614, Just about. ,Classic
13674, Are your wings healed? ,Classic
80445, Up there. ,Classic
85230," I've got a wedding present for you. It's a telex from Geneva, granting your place here official status as a United Nations Priority One Research Complex. ",Classic
91948," Welcome, Libri. ",Classic
18046, I shall feel easier if one of you remain behind. ,Classic
53664, Get up there. Stop them! ,Classic
76463, Marshal! ,Classic
150122, He seems very sure of that. ,Classic
146225, How should I know? Keep an ear to the door. ,Classic
93133," You're cleared. Move forward. You, next.   Scan detects power source located below prisoner's left elbow. Remove object from prisoner's left wrist. ",Classic
4667," You must not waste time. You must follow, quickly. One final word. If when you return, you find the Voord have taken this building, do not let them get the keys. You understand? Destroy them! Now, now, twist the dials.   For the sake of all my people, I hope you succeed. ",Classic
111421, Seven hundred and fifty nine? ,Classic
165667, Stay still! ,Classic
113818," Not in the conventional sense, no, but I am a humble student of Druidic lore. ",Classic
27561, I'm not sure. Come on. ,Classic
64762, He should have thought of that before he joined you. ,Classic
25663, It's humming. Only the real Tardis does that. ,Classic
22397, We haven't got anything to answer for. We're not interested in your treasures. ,Classic
3815, What keeps him then? The moon will soon rise to deny us darkness. ,Classic
32499," Well, do you fancy your chances outside in the corridor? No thanks. ",Classic
148082, I can't. I'm sorry. ,Classic
57604, And quick. It cuts down the time they're at risk. And they just burn out the Argonite at their leisure. ,Classic
20379," Well, that's just as well. You're the last of the Greeks now. Your friends have all sailed home without you. Well, come on. ",Classic
53027," Can't afford it. I've only just got about enough cash to buy all the junk I need for the camera. It's an expensive business and, well, I'm not good enough to be a professional yet. ",Classic
144752," Oh, no. ",Classic
161074," A place where people are strong, where they hold back the tears. A place where people pull themselves together. ",Classic
32227," Laying the new emergency power supply as you ordered, master. ",Classic
147881, You are a Time Lord? ,Classic
152055, You are my daughter. How could I forget that? Who is this with you? ,Classic
9224," Keep it, on one condition. ",Classic
53044," Yes, sir. Security cameras will have taken visual recordings, sir. ",Classic
115242, Part of what? ,Classic
73051, This is the one we spoke of. He too is not of this planet. ,Classic
77539, Search me.   Doctor? It's the Brigadier. ,Classic
80008, I wasn't going to. ,Classic
129478," But, look, Doctor ",Classic
12783," Yes, thanks. Did you? ",Classic
70840, Do you work for the government? ,Classic
102737, Destroy and be free. Destroy and be free. ,Classic
130782, We've seen her. ,Classic
91736, Perhaps it's some kind of mould. ,Classic
50980," Balan? Balan, are you there? ",Classic
142348, But that's a representation of the devil! ,Classic
147711," What do you mean, death? ",Classic
150022," There's something down here with us, Peri. ",Classic
143367," No, Doctor! I forbid you to touch the machine! ",Classic
21884, Anyone in CID.? ,Classic
22252," Yes, my plan hasn't worked. Following us closely.",Classic
95873, Operate the forcefield barrier. ,Classic
96892, Hmm? ,Classic
118829," Oh yes, two vast computers so evenly matched they can't out-think one another. ",Classic
136320, How can minds meet? ,Classic
104018," Oh, it says in the paper how it could be jolly Jack at work again. ",Classic
118782, They must be stopped. The Doctor could reprogramme the Movellan battle computers. He would counteract my advantage. The Movellan ship must be destroyed. ,Classic
87458, It's as if the Tardis was dying. ,Classic
83820, A very pretty mixed metaphor. ,Classic
133519, We can't leave these two. ,Classic
49125," Well, it has varied functions, but mainly it's a radio-visual relay for Earth, a half-way house for deep space ships, a space research station, stellar early warning station for all types of space phenomena and ",Classic
159797, Do you think that Group Captain Gilmore suspects us? ,Classic
96702, It must have been a nasty accident. ,Classic
17085," Don't you want to go with them, child? ",Classic
40637, Victoria! ,Classic
62924, Heart failure. You might say he died of fear.,Classic
47893, Yes. ,Classic
41106," Aye, it was buried under tons of rock, yet it still just got up and came after us. ",Classic
108659," Doctor, the last one I spared got away and warned his comrades. That is why I was captured. ",Classic
109572," The terms are that you take what you came for and depart, leaving us to our way. If not, your comrade will be executed. ",Classic
162917, Stay where you are. ,Classic
136163, Isn't it. Hello! ,Classic
38273, What are you doing? ,Classic
126609, He's going a bit funny. ,Classic
101372," Ah, thank you. Most kind. Yes, very different from the fellows nowadays, what? They're chopping and changing every couple of centuries. ",Classic
833," It's petrified. How fascinating, a petrified jungle. Hm. Extraordinary. Yes, I must really investigate that. Couldn't have been heat, then, and age would merely decay. ",Classic
149162, Use some of that famous American initiative. Push him outside. ,Classic
126299," Romana's in danger? Come on, let's get after her. No, I forgot. You stay there. ",Classic
44304, I hope there's plenty of air in here. ,Classic
93775,"   The Time Ring isn't here, Doctor. ",Classic
51050, Don't worry. ,Classic
108280," Now this is going to be your bad day, Doctor, if you don't start talking. ",Classic
118547, Combat units continuing intensive search. ,Classic
160866, What if they don't want to come? ,Classic
113199," What, you mean they stop time? ",Classic
114940," Precisely. We use George, the android copy of me to create a diversion, to distract their attention. ",Classic
120869, No. ,Classic
161409, You looking at me? ,Classic
82320, Get down! ,Classic
1117, He tried to get away and they hurt him. ,Classic
54297, Of course. ,Classic
57524, Seventeen. And they're millions of miles apart. So how can we be sure which one the pirates are likely to attack next? ,Classic
45936," Goodge Street? Hang on, are you anything to do with Travers and his daughter? ",Classic
40024, I won't be long. ,Classic
29942," Idle dogs. On, men.",Classic
76056, What's the meaning of this? I'm your ally! ,Classic
28679," Oh don't worry, my boy. She'll be back. ",Classic
34981, The controller is busy. I'm sorry. Over and out.,Classic
41464, Bung a rock at it. ,Classic
126093," Here, let me have a try. Just needs a little friendly persuasion, that's all. ",Classic
117022, I wish I knew. All I know is that this will tell us when we find it. ,Classic
126659, Don't touch anything!   You poisonous runt. Who is this boy? ,Classic
130024," The girl Nyssa is secured and sedated, your Majesty. ",Classic
35862," The time scanner. Instead of the normal picture showing where we are, it gives you a glimpse of the future. ",Classic
165358," Love and hate, frightening feelings, especially when they're trapped struggling beneath the surface. Don't be frightened of the water. ",Classic
90445, I've got it. ,Classic
118364, Yes! I understand. ,Classic
21476, Of course.   Is there no sign of anything yet? ,Classic
35424, We are going to take over the Gravitron and use it to destroy the surface of the Earth by changing the weather. ,Classic
70643, Is that the first course? ,Classic
42543," Aye, you'd have stuffed me to the eyeballs with anti-this and anti-that. I'd have been flat on my back for weeks. ",Classic
64160," Well, who from? ",Classic
18557, Steven? ,Classic
12519," Why? Why, have you lost one? ",Classic
138142, Primary docking alignment procedures are now complete. Passengers with mobility should prepare to disembark. ,Classic
48413, Hurry. ,Classic
83287, Only that their movements seem to be slower. ,Classic
146513," Doctor, are you here? ",Classic
147732," Oh, I see. You've got a taxi waiting. ",Classic
126882," Keeper, you were able to join us. ",Classic
60964," Jamie! Our leader, James Robert McCrimmon! ",Classic
137914, Doctor. ,Classic
114245, No. ,Classic
70094," A small experiment, that's all. ",Classic
32282, But don't you see? Human beings can't be friends with Daleks. They don't have friends. ,Classic
150193," Life like, isn't it? Or rather, death like. ",Classic
104851, In a house this size there must be protection. The professor will have weapons in fixed positions to guard the approaches. ,Classic
76919, Yes. Yes indeed. But why was I sent here? Where do these tablets come in? Ky. ,Classic
31537, Look at the eye-stick! It's watching us! ,Classic
109628, Find them. Tell them we're going. Now! ,Classic
121850," Well, now that the ships are separated, we can at last stabilise the CET properly. ",Classic
95507, It's going back under the surface. ,Classic
96458, Hiding. ,Classic
141751, Ah. Set it up here. ,Classic
134087," Morning, Doctor. I'm Captain Stapley. ",Classic
68451, Important state documents have been stolen from General Cheng Teik's suite. ,Classic
109843," Then who is in that capsule? Unauthorised use of a time capsule has only one penalty, Commander. See to it. ",Classic
32431," Yeah, well, it often happens that way, mate, when you follow blokes like him. ",Classic
52857," Well, he did. He left about a month ago. Gone to America for a year with his daughter. ",Classic
26493," It's er, it's on the house, sir. ",Classic
162313," So you've always been interested in the Psychic Circus, have you? Sit down. ",Classic
39648, Atomic weight. Read again. ,Classic
85945," If you wish to leave, then you would do well to obey me. ",Classic
163542, I've no idea. ,Classic
111063," The capsule is fixed in its present state for eternity, until he throws off the fail-safe switch. ",Classic
131028," Well, was it? ",Classic
92167, Sometimes latent neural impressions can be revived. ,Classic
21118, In the swamp by the look of things. ,Classic
133648, I should have realised. ,Classic
28490, Bring him here. The machine will deal with him. ,Classic
127274, And the Keeper? ,Classic
78832,   What's the matter? ,Classic
88028," If we set the charges on this main support, that should be close enough.   Right, set the detonator!   Oh, let me do it. ",Classic
106966, But that's illegal! ,Classic
149873, Look! ,Classic
156123, This is an illusion. I deny it! ,Classic
133211, That's deep space. ,Classic
58549," Aye, you only got us off of there because you were curious to know who we were. ",Classic
65699, Pockets of what? ,Classic
99224," Yes, isn't it. The problem is keeping it stocked up. ",Classic
156310," Unhand me! Stop!   This is preposterous. You will regret this. Mister Chambers will demand an explanation for this iniquitous, this wicked behaviour. ",Classic
76764," Now, Varan, wait. Varan, wait! ",Classic
36144," I see. Very well, you may leave us, Ola. I will conduct the investigation myself. ",Classic
37170, Situation changed. They've just made a run for it. I'll give you their description. ,Classic
34761, Then perhaps the distant roaring that we can hear is just the goddess Amdo with the indigestion? ,Classic
86272," It's gone again. Happens every time, sir. Whenever we get a sight, the R/T reception's diabolical. ",Classic
40182," Logical, yes, but ",Classic
70363, Sir? ,Classic
77704," What is it, Stu? ",Classic
71828, Very well. Start your final checkout.   Take the buggy back to the ship.,Classic
147796," Not for long, I hope. I won't last half an hour in here. It's freezing. ",Classic
124962," No, no, no. Don't! Don't! No! ",Classic
59366, Accused! Back in line. ,Classic
128837," Well done, Doctor. ",Classic
79742, Then you would be utterly alone forever. ,Classic
68320, That's a dematerialisation circuit. It's very complicated. ,Classic
158108, No. I'm a Chimeron. ,Classic
126704, What? ,Classic
133744, And you do not consider friendship a weakness? ,Classic
155780," Not human beings, not Mogarians, animal-kind. ",Classic
71805, Well? ,Classic
17055," Oh, Ian! ",Classic
51378, Yes. ,Classic
31289, I shall examine the capsule later. You may leave us. ,Classic
870," We're not on Earth, then. ",Classic
14096, Zarbi! There's no turning back. We must rush them. It only needs one of us to get through with the Destructor. ,Classic
34391, I'll take my chance. Get out! ,Classic
72664," No, you keep away. It's me he's after, not you. ",Classic
152288," I know, master, but that thing's useless. ",Classic
151701," A very great deal. Should there be another day, I will explain to you in great detail which of the many time laws I am not allowed to transgress. ",Classic
141918," Look, we don't know until we've checked. Coming? ",Classic
84557," Aye, you're right. It's incredible. The DNA must be invading the foreign cells. ",Classic
133777, I need him to help me fly the Tardis. ,Classic
87028," Oh, that's just what you want, isn't it, my silence? ",Classic
137859," Why did you not transport him in the capsule, as the Doctor instructed. ",Classic
12042, I'm going to talk to Bennett. Remember you both owe your lives to me. ,Classic
158289, He was ionised. ,Classic
68833, Questions? ,Classic
165009, But vampires don't exist. ,Classic
69089," I very much doubt it. You could try giving him one of these, if he recovers consciousness.     Listen, Jo, who organised this break? ",Classic
70846," We have a truce all right, Robert, but only because you give them our food. ",Classic
162737, Ace? ,Classic
154512," Come on now, boys. Let's not get carried away. ",Classic
86090, Doctor! ,Classic
67483, Oh? Why? ,Classic
123211, It's far in excess of our own needs. ,Classic
141561," Commander, the screen.   It's heading towards the base. ",Classic
50138, I've got the spares. ,Classic
153579," Oh, you mean they're stupid? Oh yeah, you probably do look like one, then. ",Classic
100450," Histology, that's what you need. ",Classic
34076, Guard!   Search that man. ,Classic
65829, What's happening in there? ,Classic
76629, Earth is fighting for its survival. The side-effects are of no importance! ,Classic
100485, Plastic? ,Classic
126538, Dwarf star molecules are compacted under enormous gravitational force. That's why the alloy's so heavy. ,Classic
22915," Save your breath, Steven, you'll never convince him. I tell you, he's mad! ",Classic
7663, No. ,Classic
134908," I say, brilliant ",Classic
17687," And more in keeping with the period, I would say, than a modern police box? What's the matter, Doctor? Can't you repair your camouflage unit? ",Classic
49259," Machine? No. But there's something. Some warning, some menace. ",Classic
8824," I can't do it, Barbara. ",Classic
120580, Empty? ,Classic
21365, Of course. We must get down to the Security buildings at once. The planets must all be alerted. A combined Task Force must be sent off to Kembel immediately. ,Classic
98480, What do you mean? ,Classic
91733, Yes? ,Classic
116575, Where are you going? ,Classic
102547," Right, we must fall back. Get them moving, Tomas. ",Classic
5810, What are you going to do now? ,Classic
8178," I am grateful, but what use am I now? ",Classic
128290, The degradation is random. ,Classic
151464," Yes, nearly there. ",Classic
155182," Yes, we had to allocate part of the hold. ",Classic
78681, No! I forbid it! Are you mad? Who are these strangers? ,Classic
14530," Yes, my lord. ",Classic
164438,   Set up camp over there. Move it. Take the boat up. ,Classic
79222, So what are we going to do? ,Classic
102556, It's the village. The creatures must have got through the boundary. ,Classic
161993, I was sure I heard ,Classic
21181," That's it, Bret! ",Classic
123767, Huh. Who do you think you're talking to? ,Classic
18055, How do you know they aren't? ,Classic
16630, Isn't there anything we can do? Is there no way of going back for Vicki? ,Classic
50940, So the Doctor and Jamie are on the mainland? ,Classic
29563," Look, we haven't done a thing. We didn't kill anyone. We haven't smuggled anything. Look, sir, you can take our word for it. ",Classic
67619, Almost certainly post-hypnotic alienation. ,Classic
66016, Did you replace them? ,Classic
80658," A bit of bric-a-brac, your worship. It was causing interference inside circuit three. Better put it back in the Scope. ",Classic
93532, Really? ,Classic
39364, Beta. ,Classic
2007," Yes, yes, yes. Now, the things we have to put out of action is the radio and television waves. They've obviously got complete coverage in and around the city. ",Classic
126580, What's the secret? Something you'd care to share with us? ,Classic
15786," Yes, Vicki's quite right. Quite right. ",Classic
102513, It will kill her. ,Classic
106726," Affirmative. My photon beam weaponry has four levels of intensity, Doctor. Kill, paralyse ",Classic
60626," Well, we'll go into one of the nearby zones and cross the time zone barrier on foot. Oh! Ah, yes, here we are.  ",Classic
81904, It seems a perfectly natural question. ,Classic
118783, Our firepower will be ineffective against its hull. ,Classic
149480," Well, I might be of some use to you there. I'm something of an amateur botanist myself. Ah. ",Classic
3313, He's exhausted. ,Classic
157720, What? ,Classic
11450," We're hungry, but we're not starving. I want to go to London. ",Classic
144779," Doctor, help us! ",Classic
45952, I suppose I'd better show my face. Where are they? ,Classic
63206," Liz, wait a minute. ",Classic
87257, Not this time. We're going to make it come true. ,Classic
102514," Yes, Lord. She is a savage. ",Classic
50603," Look, how long are you going to keep us like this? ",Classic
116003," Well, have you looked in his quarters? He said he was going to get some sleep. ",Classic
162830, Is it an android? ,Classic
12948," Can't I, child? Can't I? ",Classic
157138, It's for the exclusive use of the Gulmaris. ,Classic
18855, It is more elephants coming? ,Classic
22240," Yes, it has, hasn't it. Been holding off remarkably well. Well, let's have another look at the scoreboard shall we, although not very much has been happening these last few ",Classic
122128, The pilot. ,Classic
16062," We had this thing, that if we pulled that ring ",Classic
122670," Yes, it happens all the time. When a race runs out of space or destroys its home, it has to find somewhere else to live. ",Classic
106037, What? ,Classic
70885," Oh, he ",Classic
145083, The scream in the Tardis. He even felt your pain. ,Classic
219, You're treating us like children. ,Classic
21951," Oh. Well, we usually get the jokers around here at Christmas time, but we have to be lenient. So, just move along, eh? ",Classic
144753, This was your fire. The ship crash-landed. ,Classic
28183," Ah, Professor Brett. I'm from the New York Sketch, sir. ",Classic
160352, What are killjoys? ,Classic
26309," Come on, now, what's the idea? ",Classic
71709, I don't arrange these things. ,Classic
162049, You've already had one. ,Classic
12488, No. Like what? ,Classic
103047," Probably several miles deep and constantly moving. And I imagine contains valuable metallic elements, otherwise they wouldn't go to all this trouble. ",Classic
163517, We've got to stop him. ,Classic
133641, I anticipated as much. Activate the charge. ,Classic
91422," Brigadier, the robot will try to carry out Kettlewell's plan. Is the computer terminal in the bunker still active? ",Classic
85081," Nancy, he's getting worse! Isn't there anything we can do? ",Classic
114240, Don't worry about me. I'll be doing plenty of that in any case.,Classic
118328, Are you all right? ,Classic
97687," Well, within a couple of billion miles, yes. ",Classic
116190, Harg!     Shut down the main flow valve! ,Classic
55986, It's your career. ,Classic
139644, I too must change and go back to the wheelhouse. We're nearly into the final leg. ,Classic
124803, You can't take off from inside a cave. ,Classic
132169, Ah. ,Classic
129045, It's as if space had folded in on itself. ,Classic
159051, It must be worth a fortune. ,Classic
20552," Open the door and listen to me, please. ",Classic
70833, What Doctor? ,Classic
153167," Well, black light is very tricky stuff, Drathro. ",Classic
100834," No, but I like to be tidy. ",Classic
95737, Shush. Listen. It's coming this way. ,Classic
93884, Main exit blocked by explosion for a length of at least one thousand yards. ,Classic
40075," All right, Viner. This is terrible. How did it happen? ",Classic
69634," No, of course not. No, it's just that Bessie had broken down. ",Classic
109165, Many dead? ,Classic
111054, But that's impossible. Only a Time Lord could do that. ,Classic
114329, Can't see. ,Classic
27657, What is your name? ,Classic
60295, Well? This is your sphere of responsibility. ,Classic
148487," Are you employed agent of other mining companies, you and that man who was dead? ",Classic
116306, I think we're in for a storm. ,Classic
115828, We produce a hundred tons of compressed protein a day and then shoot it into Delta orbit every twelve hours. ,Classic
35867, Look! ,Classic
85069," All right, Sergeant, start scattering. ",Classic
100527, Absorbing radiation? ,Classic
107123, Is this the way you treat all your houseguests? ,Classic
70991," Well, yes. I feel a bit tired. I'll just go and lie down until dinner. ",Classic
21572, I am certain that the Daleks have already reached Mira. ,Classic
26772," Well, if he's there it's not a matter of choice. He's still searching for Dodo with Ringo. ",Classic
13287, Hmm? ,Classic
17155," This isn't an ordinary ship, you know. This is a time machine. ",Classic
17217," We'll go with you, Doctor. ",Classic
3859, Thanks for nothing. ,Classic
123213, The few of us who survived the war have our own price to pay. There will be no future generations. ,Classic
115400, The Princess! Hold your fire! ,Classic
109183," And the Seers to the Oracle. We're all slaves, all of us, of every class. Slaves to the Oracle. ",Classic
82101, That was my business. ,Classic
18434," For four dawns we hung there. Then we decided to turn. As we were doing so the Drahvins fired. Immediately we did the same, and both ships crashed. When we escaped from our ship we discovered that we could not breathe the atmosphere here, but we had a small supply of our own, and set out to help the Drahvins.   The first one we found was badly injured. We started to help the soldier. Then Maaga, their leader, appeared. She started to shoot at us, so we left. We could have fought back. Our weapons are superior to theirs. But, we do not kill. The Drahvins do. When we looked back, we saw Maaga kill the injured soldier. ",Classic
94875, Is it true? ,Classic
114450," As far as I, a mere humanoid ",Classic
41471, Are you sure it's quite safe? ,Classic
67222," My dear fellow, so you've come back to us after all. ",Classic
116247, He who holds the Symbol can see the future. The power revealed how the dryfoots would destroy Delta Magna with their fighting and their greed and the evil of their great cities. That is why my people came to settle here. ,Classic
123641, Hardin! ,Classic
36748," But how long have they been there? I mean, they weren't always in control, were they? ",Classic
41587, Miss Victoria!,Classic
118033, Wait. Where is the Doctor? ,Classic
43691, If only we had a gun. ,Classic
150335, I expected the operation to begin immediately on my arrival. Time is being wasted. ,Classic
79046," No. Well, neither would I. Even though he was responsible for the destruction of Atlantis. ",Classic
90409, Keep trying! ,Classic
68733," With the peace conference going on it's not the most tactful time to be trundling rockets about, is it? ",Classic
19541, Have you checked this? ,Classic
86010, Who is Irongron? Is he a nice chap? ,Classic
51675, Well how? ,Classic
162668," Oh, never mind. Just think like a physicist. ",Classic
24773," Doctor, where are the Refusians? ",Classic
16491, Mary Celeste? ,Classic
18530," You stay here, child. ",Classic
88745," Long enough, I hope, to force Chancellor Ortron to release the Doctor from the dungeon. ",Classic
92524, I hope you don't mind being left. ,Classic
161669," Time past, present and future. Power invincible. ",Classic
21883, The rebels? ,Classic
34718," How would I know, but it certainly isn't closing time at Betty Murphy's pub. It can be only one thing. It's the Doctor, of course. He's started to flood Atlantis. The sea's breaking in. ",Classic
58503," Right, sir. I'll bring back a chunk of her.",Classic
15158," Is there anyway of getting out of this, Doctor? ",Classic
85335, Oh! Claps the ears! ,Classic
10873, Don't lecture me. ,Classic
132730," Troops ready, sir. ",Classic
4655," Oh, Doctor, don't lets go through all that again. Let's just get on with the job. ",Classic
113766, Don't be afraid. It's only a crow. ,Classic
95257, Killed? Who? ,Classic
93442," Davros? No, you're wrong. It was he who told us how to destroy the Kaled dome. His only interest is in achieving peace. ",Classic
27141, Carefully now. ,Classic
129099, Hmm.   Valeriana officinalis centiculare europea. And just a hint of rosemary. ,Classic
81743, We're wasting time. I suggest you let me apply depth interrogation techniques without delay. ,Classic
99685, There was some trouble among the peasants in the villages. They needed a lesson. ,Classic
49159," What was the Controller talking to Bill Duggan about, Zoe? ",Classic
125670," Good, good. We'll soon be there. ",Classic
68559, Perhaps not. ,Classic
142521, The Malus' last line of defence. They'll kill as effectively as any living thing. ,Classic
94771, I'm needed back on Earth. ,Classic
33714," A chance to put paid to a villain, ma'am. ",Classic
121543, Stott! Stott of the Tryst expedition? ,Classic
1092," For the fluid link, yes. Yes, I'm afraid I cheated a little on that. I was determined to see the city, but everybody wanted to go on and, well, to avoid arguments, in short, there's nothing wrong with the fluid link. ",Classic
94478, What is your idea? ,Classic
61239," But Doctor, why did you get us here at all? ",Classic
114080, De Vries and the woman. They've been killed by that creature. You heard what K9 said. ,Classic
93795," That's up to you. But you must understand. If you're not back, I must go on. You'll die in there with them. ",Classic
16902, This is the Doctor. ,Classic
60568," Of course. That is, after all, how they got here. Logic seems to be your weak point. Do something about this resistance group before the War Lord arrives. ",Classic
21254, We shall get it back. ,Classic
152830," Well, who lived on this planet? ",Classic
62628, I'm frightened. What's going to happen? ,Classic
56954, You're only going to lose more security guards. ,Classic
21356, But why? ,Classic
56072," A space museum! Look, there you are.   A balloon.   That's a transport plane. And, now those initials, they stand for Russia. That's Gagarin, the first Earthman in space. Look.   Come on. Let's have a look round, shall we?   Just a minute. Wait for me.",Classic
70133," When we arrived there was no one here, except this man. ",Classic
114610," Well, that's handy. Why were you sealed in your capsule? ",Classic
118508, Let me see. ,Classic
61317," Well, what are we going to do, Doctor? ",Classic
81897, Cross is a trusty. They are all hardcore criminals specially imported from other prisons. ,Classic
67593,"   I think you'd better go home. Sure, look, I know all our customers and there isn't a Colonel Masters amongst them. ",Classic
94526, Let's go. ,Classic
75398," But they didn't bring the Land Rover back, sir. Colonel Trenchard said they took a taxi to the quay. ",Classic
31633," Now, look at it. I have merely given it electrical power, but it is capable of storing it. Moreover, it responds to orders. Turn around.   Move that chair.   Stop. You see? Well, just think what this could do for our mining program, our processing, packaging. Dozens of labour jobs, Governor. It may even supply the end to all this Colony's problems. ",Classic
75300, What's going on here? ,Classic
83940, Shut the door! ,Classic
49315," Aye, we're under arrest. ",Classic
156417, Me? Why should I? This is insane. ,Classic
150067, Down!   I thought it was going to hit us! ,Classic
140377, What for? ,Classic
30003," Oh, I've been a rogue, I frankly admit it. The generosity of this stranger has shamed me. But I never spilled blood in my villainy. I beg you as a fellow rogue, if you must, spare my poor villagers. ",Classic
86849," I'd like an explanation of this latest fiasco, Brigadier. You capture a dinosaur and lose it again, an aircraft hangar is wrecked, and into the bargain, Miss Smith is almost killed. Now why is this man allowed to persist in his ridiculous and useless schemes? You deny that absolutely nothing has been achieved? ",Classic
55848, Doctor! ,Classic
165400," Right, you go get cleaned up.   I'll be with you in a minute. Okay, lads, shake hands and we'll see you next week, okay? Bye now.   What? ",Classic
70067, Then they're not human at all? ,Classic
39078, He says he will confess everything. ,Classic
12605, Have we arrived? Is this Rome? ,Classic
1655, It's right that I should do so. ,Classic
7007," Right. Velocity, Chesterton. Check velocity. ",Classic
42744, Oh no you don't! ,Classic
144408, Daleks. I sometimes think those mutated misfits will terrorise the universe for the rest of time. ,Classic
155420," Do you also lack loyalty, Bruchner, to your colleagues. Before we left Mogar, we agreed that our discovery should be divulged to no one, no one, until we reached Earth. Unless you have concrete evidence to prove there is danger, I expect you to keep your word. ",Classic
122082, Where are we now? ,Classic
20274," Well done, Menelaus. But what sort of horse, that's the point. ",Classic
23502, That Englishman. ,Classic
50676, But it's true! You can ask the Doctor and Jamie. They'll be here soon. ,Classic
67478, Director? Miss Josephine Grant and Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart of UNIT. ,Classic
139108, Now you must rest.   And I must return to duty. ,Classic
92367," Yes, you can. ",Classic
6819," I greet you, Cameca. ",Classic
49100, Yes. ,Classic
146456," I will not be silent. Look at them. Unmarked, unhurt. They're not survivors from the wreck, they're spies. Put them to death. ",Classic
126241, These readings don't make sense. ,Classic
18719, But we have not destroyed one. ,Classic
101495, It would require a mathematical genius with a phenomenal grasp of applied excitonics. ,Classic
70749, Then why won't my crops grow? ,Classic
89059, The Queen is ill.   You must summon medical assistance immediately. ,Classic
22632, What's that? ,Classic
61842," Here we are, sir.   It's all we could find, sir. It must have broken up when it hit the ground. ",Classic
65988," If I'd listened to all the others, Petra, this project would never have begun. And if I listen to them now, it'll never be completed. Have all systems modified to this new programming. ",Classic
38001, Superintendent? Commandant here. ,Classic
28398, No. Just water. ,Classic
3592, Why not let them go on their way. ,Classic
48387, It's very quiet. Do you think Victoria really is down here? ,Classic
13937, Doctor! ,Classic
66123, Smith. Doctor John Smith. ,Classic
78085, I exist only to do his will. He is not to be commanded. ,Classic
53307," Right, stick around for a while. ",Classic
86440," We have just met a man from the past. A peasant from the age of King John. No, honestly, General, it's true. ",Classic
88698, Federation troops? ,Classic
142154, Oh yes? And who might he be? ,Classic
76062, You did what? You realise what will happen? ,Classic
11843," Yes, I afraid we've had so little time for that sort of thing lately. ",Classic
29504," Oh. Then you did speak with him. There's a damning fact, indeed. ",Classic
58452," Just a minute. Look, I've got to go. Once of the spider teams wants picking up. ",Classic
41466," Jamie, I am. ",Classic
92005, Where's it from? ,Classic
49603," Oh. Oh, thank you. You will tell the guard, won't you? ",Classic
150726," No, no, I'm afraid this is Botcherby's last curtain call. ",Classic
98477, But plants need nitrogen. ,Classic
147141," Yes, Doctor. ",Classic
126841," Adric. If I knew everything that was going to happen, where would the fun be?   Hello. ",Classic
97204, Where are we going? ,Classic
124687, Do you accept the post? ,Classic
123829, I've already sent for them. Why aren't they here? Go and see what's happened to them. ,Classic
5312," Ian, Altos, it's all right. The ice has melted. ",Classic
68679," Come on, Mailer, out you come. Get behind me there. ",Classic
8383," My mind tells me that you wish to see your home again, and yet there is a part of you which calls for adventure. A wanderlust. ",Classic
44727, But I still don't understand what's happened to Fariah. ,Classic
25638, It's another trick. Roll the dice. ,Classic
30090," Man, it's blowing like crazy out there. All I can see is snow, snow and more snow. ",Classic
19408, The last place they would think of looking. ,Classic
55261," Well, she doesn't have to go, does she? Well, does she or doesn't she? ",Classic
2173," Now, I'll take a look at this cleft. The torch? Pay it out slowly. ",Classic
60358, She was under the truth machine. ,Classic
42066, Jamie! Jamie! Jamie! Yeti's coming! ,Classic
134823," Well, it would help if you could remember where you came in. ",Classic
46022," No, sir ",Classic
162992, What? ,Classic
84430," Brigadier, do you want a little more wine? ",Classic
83103, Bring cutting equipment.,Classic
14869, He has a lot to answer for. ,Classic
7559, Very well. But you will do nothing further until I have considered the matter. ,Classic
150568, That's enough. ,Classic
89443, Get the others together. There's no time to be lost. ,Classic
34172," The two young men are at the mine. The girl is still at large, and so is the Doctor. But we'll find them. They cannot get away. ",Classic
102012," Speak, lord, for your servant hears. ",Classic
21767, He seems determined. Does it really matter? ,Classic
73013," Look, what's going on, Brigadier? ",Classic
93954, You mean we can't get any further? ,Classic
79178," It was hunting you, wasn't it, Doctor? ",Classic
160804," Makes sense, doesn't it. ",Classic
4331," Oh, he is a fortunate one. But our friend here made a truly royal gesture which we have accepted, although it might upset you. ",Classic
17139,"   There's someone in the living quarters. Doctor, be careful. It's obviously a Dalek.   Steven!",Classic
26537," Er, yes, er, excuse me, sir, but I think under the circumstances you'd better remain here until Mister Werp arrives. ",Classic
118277, A composite material. Gravel in a binding of possibly limestone and clay. ,Classic
53250, That's incredible! ,Classic
6355, It is not magic. It is the juice from a plant. Tonila will know. Why did he aid you? ,Classic
65802, Anything that happens in this area is my responsibility. ,Classic
90141, We might as well throw ourselves off the cliff as attack the eight legs. ,Classic
31323," Examiner, I shall have to make it your responsibility. ",Classic
45998," Yes, well as I say, when I came to there was no sign of the Yeti, so I wandered around a bit, got lost and saw the fungus. ",Classic
102557, Looks like it. They're psi-tri projections from the dark side of Xoanon's id with enough kinetic energy to kill. Looks as if your friends are running out of time. ,Classic
59272," All right, all right. And you, what are you doing in the front line? No place for young ladies. ",Classic
90351, All praise to the Great One! ,Classic
54431," Yes, that's a good idea. We might have a try. ",Classic
45335," Well, let's go home and look again, shall we? You know what you're like. ",Classic
57704," Oh no, sir. We haven't the man power. Besides Sorba knew he could only hope to delay things. ",Classic
24527, Strangers? What sort of strangers? ,Classic
136199," Oh, do be quiet just for a moment. It is horrible.   I'm very glad the Legend of the Return is just a story. It is, isn't it? ",Classic
70562," Because the atmosphere out there might be poisonous, that's why. I'll just check. ",Classic
15442," Yes, we heard you the first time, but we don't feel like moving, do we? ",Classic
97690, Two of them? ,Classic
95212, Loch Ness is seven miles from the coast. Are you suggesting it walks overland without being seen? ,Classic
125473, We know everything here. ,Classic
32149, What? What are you talking about? ,Classic
31246, Look at this. ,Classic
17987," Yes, it's in its last moments of life. Soon it will explode. ",Classic
111504, Highness. ,Classic
161073," I'm sure you will, Helen A. ",Classic
122448," Yes, yes. A good thing I got stuck in it, too, otherwise your ship would still have been there. ",Classic
31446, Perhaps we should ask the Governor about that? I wish to see him immediately. ,Classic
99828,   There's something behind us. I can feel it in my bones.,Classic
94996, What are you? ,Classic
153043, Cease your prattle. ,Classic
973, Well? ,Classic
95906," Yes, I know. I'll take care. ",Classic
5347, Yes. ,Classic
159455, Why? ,Classic
11793, They're trying to pilot the Earth right out of its orbit. The bomb's due to go off in half an hour's time. ,Classic
73904," A family of Quisling's, eh? ",Classic
81789, Vanished. The Draconian kidnappers have completely disappeared. No trace of them at all. ,Classic
105385, It was his seamanship got us ashore. ,Classic
96682, Mister Scarman? Hey.   Oh! Doctor. ,Classic
66409," Listen to me, Stahlman, for God's sake. ",Classic
128807, Jettisoned.,Classic
121496, North-east? ,Classic
81021, Wait! ,Classic
44856, What's this? What is this? ,Classic
85371, You realise this is a very dangerous place to be in? ,Classic
122404, Skonnos! ,Classic
41231," No, tact, Jamie. I'll handle this. Hello, guard. good evening. I wonder if you can help us. I left a silver sphere by the Buddha there. ",Classic
41971, The Doctor's got it wrong. I've seen that thing in the cave. That's what we've got to destroy. ,Classic
5269, Down there. There's somebody down there. ,Classic
12723, He's in the apoditarium. ,Classic
66921, I'll check the inner corridor. ,Classic
49074," And this is my little kingdom. Hey, how do you like the Greenhouse? ",Classic
95252," Thank you, sir. Good hunting, Miss Smith. ",Classic
159411, It's beyond the realm of current technology. ,Classic
104152," If he troubles us further, Lord, I will deal with him personally. ",Classic
123058," A tachyon field can therefore be made to arrive at point B, that visidome, say, before it's departure from point A, the Generator. For the next hour and a half, we will examine the wave equations that define the creation of solid tachyonic images. ",Classic
108919, Four zero and cubit. ,Classic
135291, Will it be guarded? ,Classic
41475," Hey you're taking an awful risk, Doctor. ",Classic
85403," Oh, it pleases him to be high. He's like a cockerel. ",Classic
21482, Where? They're expecting me now to arrive with the taranium. ,Classic
151507," Will that be your handiwork, Doctor? ",Classic
8386, We could be going round in circles. ,Classic
27089," Very like us, in some ways. ",Classic
28600," Well, I fear we've riled him, my boy. You see, the official mind can only take in so much at a time. However, we must keep our weather eyes open. Come along.",Classic
110445, I've kept my part of the bargain. What more do you want? ,Classic
14795," But, Joanna? ",Classic
30470, Dyson! ,Classic
6757," If it is your wish, let our marriage be postponed. What is it you're making. ",Classic
25000, How dare you. ,Classic
19474, Yes. One day. Thank you. ,Classic
114750," Oh yes, all right. ",Classic
844, The ship's no good without him. We'd better keep an eye on him. He seems to have a knack of getting himself into trouble. ,Classic
131437, Where? ,Classic
165633, How many times have I told you about playing with fire?,Classic
119689, Tinkering. Every man must have his hobby. ,Classic
58940," Already? All right, listen. We can't afford to wait for Clancey to take that ship up. Activate the overriding unit now. ",Classic
83615, Yes? ,Classic
44733, Salamander to the life. ,Classic
153002, Hi. ,Classic
78042," Hello, Sergeant Benton here, sir. ",Classic
55184, What for? ,Classic
77739," Well, that's Venusian miles. In Earth miles, that's be about seventy two point seven nine. Let's take a look at the map. Well, we're about here. That should put us somewhere around there. A village called Wootton. ",Classic
41419," It were better that you were not found in here, my child. ",Classic
107817," It's the Gatherer! Quick, run! ",Classic
103901, This is a big village. ,Classic
13900, I've told you before not to judge by appearances. ,Classic
66133," I am Section Leader Elizabeth Shaw, yes. ",Classic
125530," You. You, come with me. ",Classic
81310, Watch carefully. ,Classic
44285," All right, they're gone. ",Classic
101371," Here you are, sir. ",Classic
156263, There are times in our relationship when I feel an interpreter wouldn't come amiss. ,Classic
139999, I wish I could. ,Classic
101228," Oh, Sarah. Don't you forget me. ",Classic
86419," Sir, this is the Doctor, our scientific advisor. ",Classic
163723, I thought it might. ,Classic
19891," I sought Achilles, father, even to the Grecian lines, but he skulked within his tent. He feared to face me. ",Classic
130090, What have I got to lose? ,Classic
161834, They can't have lost them.   I thought not. ,Classic
9069," My credentials.   And while we are about it, why wasn't I met, hmm? Do you realise that I walked through the whole of Paris without a guard? Me? ",Classic
27452, Five point one. Zero. Five point six. Zero. Six point one. Zero. Six point seven. Zero. Seven point one. Zero. ,Classic
102417," Idiot, you'll attract more of them! ",Classic
87308, Do you know what's on the other side of that airlock? A flight of steps. ,Classic
88819," I protest, Commander. You are exceeding your authority. ",Classic
72717, Reverse what? ,Classic
137919, Amazing. The Brigadier's timing. A millisecond either way and ,Classic
121226, I don't know. ,Classic
10170, Don't worry. You can leave it all to me. I'll tow an outboard with me and come back in that. ,Classic
160494," There's a million blues songs start like that. But I did wake up one morning, and suddenly something was very clear. I couldn't go on smiling. Smiling while my friends disappeared, wearing this uniform and smiling and trying to pretend I'm something I'm not. Trying to pretend that I'm happy. Better to let it end. Better to just relax and let it happen. I woke up one morning and I realised it was all over. ",Classic
158986," I worked as a waitress in a fast food cafe. Day in, day out, same boring routine. Some boring life. It was all wrong. It didn't feel like me that was doing it at all. I felt like I'd fallen from another planet and landed in this strange girl's body, but it wasn't me at all. I was meant to be somewhere else. Each night I'd walk home and I'd look up at the stars through the gaps in the clouds, and I tried to imagine where I really came from. I dreamed that one day everything would come right. I'd be carried off back home, back to my real mum and dad. Then it actually happened and I ended up here. Ended up working as a waitress again, only this time I couldn't dream about going nowhere else. There wasn't nowhere else to go. ",Classic
58380," Oh, Doctor, there's something over there. ",Classic
91796, We do seem to have a small communications problem. ,Classic
78541, Right. Isolate matrix scanner. ,Classic
35488, Ben? ,Classic
136632, What do you suggest? ,Classic
76121," Eh?   Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. ",Classic
45075, I want you to take my two friends to the gates and see they get away all right. ,Classic
148449, Who are you? ,Classic
134941, Have you any idea what would have happened if I'd tried to go ,Classic
48338," I have the girl. She is my prisoner. She is my hostage. Do you understand? If you want her to live, come over to us. Come over to us. ",Classic
148686," Yes. The theory being that a man scared for his life will find solutions to this planet's problems, except the poor unfortunate will discover there are no popular solutions to the difficulties he will find waiting for him here. ",Classic
34502, He's only bluffing. Nothing can start without him. ,Classic
84268," It may surprise you to learn, Professor Jones, that Miss Grant is one of my staff. I think that she and the Doctor are quite capable of looking after themselves. ",Classic
13791," They seized this planet long ago, enslaved your forebears and mine who remained. They are spreading the poisonous web of the Animus to every corner of Vortis. ",Classic
94680," Come on, let's hide. ",Classic
89787, Come back! ,Classic
127372, That's enough. Kill them! ,Classic
145324, Masks.   Now!   Quick. Come on. ,Classic
100916, Explain! ,Classic
55109, He and some students gone out to the Learning Hall. They're going to wreck the machines. ,Classic
62679," Look, this poor devil sees his friend killed in an accident, he wanders around those caves for hours before they get him out, well quite naturally he has some kind of breakdown. ",Classic
106016," It is here, Doctor. I did it! Finished! ",Classic
11345," Oh, I don't know. Over that way somewhere. I'll take 'em back with me. ",Classic
52590," They're no longer human beings, just fictional characters. Now, if you consent to take my place here, they can be released. ",Classic
162935,   I hear you. ,Classic
56871, It'd better be.,Classic
163013, Thought so.   Doctor? ,Classic
112482, Captain. ,Classic
78938, Obey! ,Classic
79201," Hurry, men, and keep your heads down.   Great shot, Johnson.   Brigadier, do you read me? Over. ",Classic
102025, Yes. I was cast out for speaking against him. ,Classic
47895," Well, we have to wait. ",Classic
23923, Must not? ,Classic
151441," Ah, yes. A small ruse, Borad, to put the traitor off his guard.",Classic
50144," Good! Now, now listen to me, I want you to bring it to me. Get someone to show you the way through the air corridors. Hello. I think I've got company. ",Classic
121765," Hello, K9. ",Classic
73736, I'm asking the questions. I repeat. You're a spy. ,Classic
14861," Doctor, will he really see Jerusalem? ",Classic
12161," Yes, I think you're right. Chesterton! ",Classic
13970," Thank you.   Thank you. I have great admiration for your wise men and their judgement. Now, my dear, is everything quite clear, hmm?  ",Classic
150058, Then why do you kill them? ,Classic
89861, I shall not. ,Classic
103786," Get down, Toos! ",Classic
101103," No, stop! It'll crush her!   Oh, it's horrid. It's so horrible. It was supposed to remake her. It's destroyed her.   We killed her. ",Classic
154177," Can we rest a moment? Oh, Doctor. Doctor! ",Classic
72177, The chat bit. Momentous occasion and all that. ,Classic
96716," I hear you, Master. ",Classic
57549, Yeah. It's the head quarters of the Issigri Mining Corporation. The most productive planet in the entire galaxy. ,Classic
83092," Come on, Marat! ",Classic
155306," You sought reassurance, I've given it. ",Classic
111825, Who's got me covered? ,Classic
22758, Would you mind telling me how that thing works? ,Classic
42068, But we have destroyed the machines. ,Classic
137500, And I'm coming with you. ,Classic
9510," I'll try. Now, don't worry, I'll cover up for you. But you know, I have a feeling that this young girl is tied up in this somehow. Now I think if we let her go, I personally could follow, and then arrest all of them. All I need from you is the key to that child's cell. ",Classic
79361, Heads. ,Classic
55004, Thara! You'll die!,Classic
85042, You mean they might be able to fly? ,Classic
103724," D84 and Leela. Remember, Toos. If we don't come back, you'll have to find some other way of warning the outside world. ",Classic
165142, I can't. ,Classic
53877, What was the matter with him? ,Classic
105683, Where do you suppose his Lordship's gone? ,Classic
4573, Yes. ,Classic
76671," Varan! Listen. We're going to try and get you off Skybase. Now when I go, I shall leave this door unlocked. ",Classic
4367, They're accused of stealing the Khan's property. ,Classic
148907, Then thy name will be on the list. ,Classic
23082," Oh, oh, yes, of course. Here, take this. ",Classic
23597," No, they won't. I'll be the one they chase. Now if you come back here I'll know where to find you, and I can join you as soon as possible. ",Classic
115947, We can take them by surprise. There's only a handful of them. ,Classic
48160," Robson was here not long ago. We must find him and prevent them using him, for his own sake as well as ours. ",Classic
109320, I wonder where it all went? ,Classic
93260," Well, knowing our ultimate form, Davros had to devise a travel machine. The Dalek. ",Classic
107700, The Collector recently raised death taxes seventeen percent. ,Classic
152811, Hmm. Yeah. ,Classic
151913, What? ,Classic
153853, Neons? ,Classic
151883, It is the Doctor. ,Classic
49081," Oh, it controls the laser gun. Without it the gun's useless. ",Classic
3304, You think you could reach the oasis? ,Classic
47804, You're taking over then? ,Classic
79545, I'm not sure that I really want to. ,Classic
35036," You will be too, mate, if you've been up here long enough. Say, are you responsible for the broken bags here. ",Classic
117254, We'd better warn the Doctor. Come on. ,Classic
147475," Lytton? Tall, lean, dark, dark, well-spoken? The sort of man who might shoot his mother just to keep his trigger finger supple? ",Classic
21064, Operate Randomiser! ,Classic
102926, Range two ten. Running time point four three. ,Classic
136023, The Federator's son is bored. ,Classic
3385," Young man, you have no concept of what is happening, have you? And you still don't seem to realise that you're speaking to a man of superior intellect.",Classic
52934, I am sorry. All personnel are engaged. ,Classic
48761," Doctor, the warning mechanism obviously thought there was something wrong out here, but what? I mean, everything's so, well, dead, isn't it? ",Classic
146631, No need. Thank you for bringing me here. ,Classic
109193," Stop, Trog, or I'll fire.   Suspect sighted on eight, moving nine. ",Classic
52663, The time? ,Classic
49973, Yes? ,Classic
68286, It's locked. ,Classic
54820, Standing by.   Ten seconds and it's on the button! It's on the button! We've done it! ,Classic
158754," Oh, you'd like the spacecraft, would you? When you first came here you had nothing. You were willing enough to take my payment then. But now you want to leave. Perhaps you have memories of a home you can return to? Perhaps I should have put you into cryosleep along with all the others and erased your memories.   Perhaps you need reminding. As long as you bear my mark, I own you. ",Classic
80082, But the Doctors. ,Classic
89371, And about time. ,Classic
97478," Good for me, too. I hope you've got some champagne on ice down there, have you?",Classic
44039, No. ,Classic
39741, Why obey without question? ,Classic
81396," Emergency, emergency. Red alert. This is cargo ship C982 on coordinate eight nine seven two stroke six four eight three. Draconian battle cruiser has now locked on. They are about to force entry. Repeat, they are about to force entry. ",Classic
86139, He is a toad. Who know what a toad thinks? ,Classic
46069," It's a sort of Mark Two, isn't it. ",Classic
71938," Surrender, the rest of you. You won't be killed. ",Classic
148859," Oh, well, I'm lost. Why would anyone want to smash machinery? ",Classic
57096, Ah. ,Classic
37413," And we won't be long away, will we? ",Classic
10849," Survivors of London, the Daleks are the masters of Earth. Surrender now and you will live. Those wishing to surrender must stand in the middle of the street, and obey orders received. Message ends. ",Classic
96206, We're moving again. ,Classic
102220, I don't understand. ,Classic
162324," Come, come, dear boy, don't be so absurdly modest. ",Classic
103861, Your Emma? ,Classic
317," So that when we go out of that door, we won't be in a junkyard in London in England in the year 1963? ",Classic
119187," Ah. Well, you're a beautiful woman, probably, and Duggan was trying to summon up the courage to ask you out to dinner, weren't you, Duggan? ",Classic
128950, Other visitor? That must be ,Classic
59075, What's happened? Have you found it? ,Classic
109867," Right, you lead. ",Classic
144873, Where are you going? ,Classic
135538," Only your mind, Doctor. Your body is still in the termination area, shielded by an energy band. ",Classic
76222," Yeah, seems a bit pointless, doesn't it. ",Classic
99900, Why not? You still have the poison? You will announce some new finding. You will say that some new conjunction has come to light. You'll find a way. Sudden death. ,Classic
66589, I do. He talks a lot of good sense! Doctor? ,Classic
3300, There's no more? ,Classic
108794, You mean he's in there now? ,Classic
72066, Oh. Then it's what one might call a publicity gimmick. ,Classic
24597, It's deserted. ,Classic
122109, What's a singularity? ,Classic
158752, Yes? ,Classic
133809, How much time have we got? ,Classic
92897," Styre, it's not over yet. ",Classic
6074, Then why not leave well alone? Human sacrifice is their tradition. Their religion. There's nothing we can do about it. ,Classic
161587, You fool. Without the bow the statue's power is nothing. ,Classic
24012," You forget, I've never met your granddaughter. ",Classic
123593, The Foamasi shuttle. He's mad! You've got to stop him. You've got to stop him. He's mad!   Stop him! Stop him!   Oh no. An army of Pangols.   Stop this. The Doctor's in there. ,Classic
141182," And what of you, Doctors? Do you claim immortality too? ",Classic
86483," It must have gone round the corner, sir. Should we go after it? ",Classic
143155," It's not easy to live inside the system, but to live outside of it takes more than you've got.   Leave him be. He's made his choice. ",Classic
155832," That's right, in the vault. ",Classic
37308," I've heard all I want to from you. What do you mean, they're engaged. This is the Commandant. Thank you. ",Classic
69285," Yes, sir. ",Classic
26922, Then the Doctor was wrong. We're not in the future at all. We must be back at the beginning of man. ,Classic
44980, I still want to see the surface. ,Classic
63218, I can't understand why it didn't see us. ,Classic
162813, We'd better get the Doctor. ,Classic
61334," When will they be here, Doctor? ",Classic
65723," Yes, sir. ",Classic
69653, We're on our way. Over and out. ,Classic
133830, Search this ship. ,Classic
83679, There it is! ,Classic
118918," Nice, isn't it? ",Classic
78820," We'll tell the Doctor, that's what we can do. Now, take me to the King. ",Classic
162900, What was that? ,Classic
87315, Stop him! We'll all be killed! ,Classic
91848," I'm no regressive, I'm a Naval officer!   Sarah! ",Classic
11237, I have. ,Classic
89411, Please? ,Classic
147053," Azmael. Azmael. I shall miss you, old friend. I shall indeed. ",Classic
133243, All part of the daily routine. ,Classic
91894, Earth is ours. ,Classic
140849," [The Guard Commander has brought a casket, and places it on the table.) ",Classic
92753," Yes, well, I can't say I blame him for being wary of friend Vural, at any rate. You know, it's absolutely typical of Harry! How anyone in his proper mind could fall down a whacking great subsidence like. That's it! ",Classic
57388," With any luck, we should have some nice heavy rain before long. Ah, there we are. ",Classic
48766, Shall we open the door? ,Classic
60060, You're going to tell me where they're making for. ,Classic
6354, It is true. ,Classic
61689," Doctor Lomax, I took that blood sample from an adult male patient. Now you tell me it's not human blood. I don't know if that makes me a doctor or a vet, but it's still my job to look after him. ",Classic
104796," That's right. It's a trionic lattice, an integral part of a time cabinet. It's impossible to open it without it. ",Classic
58279," Yes, I wonder why you didn't? ",Classic
12101," Yes, Doctor. ",Classic
136086," No, no, no, no. Please stay. My son can dress quite quickly. ",Classic
49609, These are no good anyway. They're covered in plastic. ,Classic
102079, Bring it forth. ,Classic
74120, Must be on the blink. ,Classic
162369," The acts will keep on coming now, we promise, and no one will ever go near the bus again. Those who remain are your servants to do with as you wish. No, I never wanted to resist your power. ",Classic
112041, What is this place? ,Classic
69317," Am I? Unless the Doctor does what I ask, Miss Grant, Mailer will shoot you here and now. ",Classic
13091," Well, nearly all mine, dear. You know how I've always longed to rebuild Rome, name it after myself. ",Classic
101657," Well, it's better than being vaporised, and that's what's in store for me if I don't produce the Master. ",Classic
107910, I can see we're going to get on famously. ,Classic
155323," An occasion that will not arise, Doctor. Your lives are forfeit, as I have ably proven. ",Classic
5495, Before you what? ,Classic
107050, Authorisation from whom? ,Classic
48824," Yes, I know. There's someone in the control room. ",Classic
62273," Well, I think this is the right room. Liz? ",Classic
15504, Then see that my order is carried out. ,Classic
96842," Intruders, you face the twin guardians of Horus. One is programmed to deceive, the other points truly.   The two switches control your fate. Instant freedom or instant death. Before you choose, you can ask one guardian one question. This is the riddle of the Osirans. Which is the guardian of life? ",Classic
134379, Mechanistic? ,Classic
134774," Using our psychic power, we melded into a unity. ",Classic
33541," Father, I'm fine. And you? ",Classic
117356," He left this situation report, sir. ",Classic
10163," You don't know anything! All you care about is how much money you can make. Why did you have to kill him? Couldn't you have given him money, bought him off? Oh, what's the use. ",Classic
23934, But I thought? ,Classic
60381, I don't know! ,Classic
149707," Yes, I heard something about that. But you still act on their instructions. ",Classic
114273, That's ridiculous. ,Classic
35484, Why? ,Classic
114269," Well, I don't know, exactly. All I remember is Vivien Fay coming up behind me then waking up here.   What do you mean, hyperspace? It can't be. ",Classic
122137, Sacrifices? ,Classic
121187, Has something been stolen? ,Classic
149918, Switching to visual. Must have lost track of us. ,Classic
5041, I saw some iron bars in an alcove down there.   Ian. Ian! ,Classic
36777, That is no longer necessary. ,Classic
140484, Halt at once. Halt or you will be exterminated. It is the Doctor. The Doctor must be destroyed. Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate! ,Classic
1521, I think there's a sentry down the other end of the corridor. ,Classic
162229," Ahem. Awfully sorry to butt in like this, old boy, but I'm afraid you're wanted. You're the next one due on in the ring.   ",Classic
153855, Those. How much time do have we got? ,Classic
102070, Who? ,Classic
91959, It was horrible. A shape. I'm sorry. I'm all right now. ,Classic
38016, What's that? ,Classic
82716," In our legend, there is a being, a figure from another planet who came to Skaro when the Thals were in their greatest peril, in something called a Tardis. He had three companions with him. ",Classic
132603," Tanner will take you, Bob. ",Classic
38363," Perry, sir. ",Classic
34097," Ah, Mister Damon, you're back. Did your operation go well? ",Classic
128578, Wait! You don't know those corridors. I got lost in them when I first came into the Tardis and I can tell you they're a nightmare. ,Classic
92080," Oh, yes, dead simple. ",Classic
153209, Follow him. Use your tracer disc. He must be brought back unharmed.,Classic
95969, What? But the canisters. I promised. ,Classic
50992," Yes, right. ",Classic
88189," Oh well, of course, if you don't want to hear about it. ",Classic
62009," Yes, it does seem to need a few finishing touches. ",Classic
145066," The worst place in the universe. An English public school on Earth. Come on, let's get back to the others. ",Classic
93650, The dissidents. What progress are they making? ,Classic
153841," You two, over there. ",Classic
155454, Doctor? ,Classic
144476, I've left my wallet in the hotel. ,Classic
26358," Time's about up, Holliday. You comin' out? ",Classic
130972, Where does it come from? ,Classic
44344, Of course. ,Classic
17511," Don't worry, Father. My wife Edith, will call regularly and attend to any additional work, and I will come to if, if work permits. ",Classic
110067," No, it was the crown! The crown almost killed him! ",Classic
60914, You have no right to interrupt my interrogation. ,Classic
25648," I don't know. Poor old Cyril. Hey, this triangle's covered in slippery powder. He must have put this here himself and forgotten all about it. He was caught in his own trap. It serves him right. Come on, Dodo. The game's over. ",Classic
20125, And I will not tolerate interference from a fortune-teller of notorious unreliability. ,Classic
75488," No, after you. ",Classic
116451, We must follow. ,Classic
127647, I'll go. ,Classic
57654, There's only one thing we can do. ,Classic
105279, In England we have proper customs. It ain't fitting for a body just to be left. ,Classic
94323," They're deliberately ignoring our signals, Commander. Look, they're moving into docking orbit. ",Classic
14404, What is your name? ,Classic
153051," Merely visiting, like good yourself. ",Classic
60471," But this one is different, surely? ",Classic
148132, Surely that is not too much to ask. ,Classic
10397," Well, if it is, it'll tell us what we're fighting against. We might even find a cure. ",Classic
70177," Very good, sir. ",Classic
158555, Forward! ,Classic
19743, No! I haven't got time to argue. I want to get to the Doctor before they cut his head off. Now stay here. ,Classic
55873, Yes. They were primitives. ,Classic
12927, Why not? ,Classic
30195, No. It's 4-3-2. ,Classic
129796, First he intends to replace the population of Earth with his own. ,Classic
128263," This is not conquest, it's devastation. ",Classic
71346, I have no desire to discuss that before the inquiry. Kindly let me know when you're all ready. ,Classic
23053, The insult to Princess Marguerite. ,Classic
87273," Oh, very well, my dear, I'll help you, but all our friends are waking up. Aren't you going to say welcome to them? ",Classic
44224," That would be a comfort, yes. ",Classic
19017, But it wasn't my fault. How was I supposed to know? ,Classic
104001," Well, I don't know what to do about this lot. ",Classic
121766," Hello, Doctor. ",Classic
159292," Ah yes, but by which route? The direct route with Glitz, or the scenic route? Well? Do you fancy a quick trip round the twelve galaxies and then back to Perivale in time for tea? ",Classic
95827, I don't think so. Let him finish. ,Classic
89769," Right, fasten your seatbelt. ",Classic
79560," Well, yes, I am, and Miss Grant. ",Classic
26352, Right. ,Classic
9802, Up with the Revolution. You! You came back. ,Classic
42514, All relevant factors now presented. How should we act? ,Classic
34482, He must be here somewhere. Search the temple. ,Classic
95195, The fact is what? ,Classic
4452," It wasn't just my ship then. Whatever double-game Tegana is playing, he must have decided upon a long time before we appeared on the scene. ",Classic
107526, What? ,Classic
20469," A girl you call her, you love-sick fool, but I know she's a witch and must be burnt along with that horse out there. See. There she stands. ",Classic
125261," Yes, I suppose I am, really. I've never given it much thought. ",Classic
93381, Did you ever doubt it? ,Classic
152582, Not when there is an escape pod to be had. ,Classic
113445," It's been nice knowing you, Doctor. ",Classic
2285, Details. ,Classic
92178, I cannot permit it. The shock might kill you. ,Classic
1287, I hadn't thought of that. ,Classic
10337," Oh, all right. There's plenty to hold on to. ",Classic
1110," My legs, my legs. I can't use my legs. ",Classic
5462," Yes, yes, I think I would. ",Classic
80106," Goodbye. Well, goodbye, everybody. Goodbye. It's been so nice to meet me. ",Classic
101465," Yes, framed. It's an Earth expression. It means that someone's gone to a great deal of trouble to get me into this mess. ",Classic
58547, No. ,Classic
72308," Silly, really. I swear it sounds as if he's ",Classic
119758, And you will see the culmination of my live's work. ,Classic
109619," The Quest is over. Set course for Minyos Two. K9, how do we stand for launch? ",Classic
4808, I am to be punished. ,Classic
139874, Thank you. ,Classic
6419," Ixta, I have need of the drawings. ",Classic
123899," Well, now his probe circuit's jammed. ",Classic
39356," Friend. Hello, friend. ",Classic
95367," No, just a minute, just a minute. ",Classic
30683," Secretary Wigner, sir. ",Classic
155398," I could have been comparing you to an elephant. Well, figuratively speaking. They never forget. ",Classic
123790," Impossible, or simply beyond your comprehension? ",Classic
31430, You opened up the capsule without permission. You found the inner compartment containing three Daleks. You took one of them away and you hid it! ,Classic
120277, Of course I'm sure. There's only that one on this planet. ,Classic
1707, Is he badly hurt? ,Classic
134734, What are you talking about? ,Classic
127029," Consuls, you're making a big mistake. I'm sure you're all charming, reasonable people at heart. ",Classic
1682, Who are you? ,Classic
163715," Yes, sir. My guardian was most concerned that you'd been kept waiting, but be assured he'll join us shortly. ",Classic
42161, Is it a man? ,Classic
148126," As always, I seek ways to market the resources of our poor planet ",Classic
93668, How's the Doctor? ,Classic
107306," The scanner awoke the power. You know about the scanner, of course. I've been watching you for some time, you see. Through you, I shall conjure and control the supreme power of the ancients. ",Classic
61070," And how do you propose to deal with them, with your guards scattered all over the War Zones? ",Classic
53848," Vaughn? I. Brigadier, your UNIT force will take no precipitous action without top-priority permission. That is an order. ",Classic
109208, The Quest is the Quest. ,Classic
105086," Shooting star, eh? ",Classic
154520, Search Conv Corp. Who are they? ,Classic
151174," Oh, never mind what I said in the Tardis. Off you go. The Maylin and I have important things to discuss, don't we, Maylin. ",Classic
56740, No. The Doctor said they can't stand heat. ,Classic
158428," Of course, of course. I am Goronwy. ",Classic
130251, Isn't there? ,Classic
99957, Take the sorcerer too. A gold piece to the first that splits him.   Brethren. ,Classic
83800, I've no idea. Except ,Classic
151314, What are you doing here? ,Classic
128145, So? ,Classic
112693, We're not going to be pampered frightened vegetables any more. We've got friends now. ,Classic
115904, Kroll! Kroll! Kroll! ,Classic
95724, They must be recaptured and made to pay for this. ,Classic
22027, In here quick. ,Classic
80125," Yes, for us. ",Classic
159046," Oh, no, no. We might be deep beneath Iceworld, but Kane could find his way here easily enough. No, the treasure's got to be somewhere else, somewhere beyond Kane's reach. What does he fear most? ",Classic
41229, Maybe that guard's taken it. ,Classic
61688," It is not a human blood type. The platelet stickiness shows that. Henderson, are you there? Hello? ",Classic
71708," By order of Captain Dent, all colonists must be on the ship one hour before blast off. There can be no exceptions. Each of you can bring luggage to weigh not more than seven kilos.   Satisfied? ",Classic
89626,   I don't know what is going on. ,Classic
64621," I know that, but how are we going to stop them?",Classic
150866, Why? ,Classic
70981, You mean considering how old the equipment is. ,Classic
49614," Enrico?   Oh, hello, Leo. ",Classic
151532," No, Herbert. You stay here. Good luck. ",Classic
100908, It seems you speak the truth.   Why should they attack me with their primitive devices? ,Classic
115524," Very well, my dear, I may just do that before long. You have become dispensable, Princess. ",Classic
110994, Then I shall look after it. ,Classic
127979, Crazy idiot of a pilot! Wait till I have a word with him.   Who's that? ,Classic
68881, Whose usual technique? ,Classic
141140," Something's wrong, you know. ",Classic
106260," What are the coordinates? Doctor, what are the coordinates? ",Classic
157142," That's the spirit, Mel. This could be fascinating. Are you coming? ",Classic
22681, That is being done. Do we now deal with Mavic Chen? ,Classic
63357, Some of them are still in hibernation. The others use the power to bring them back to life. ,Classic
110089, Yes. ,Classic
46831," Don't worry, it'll work. It's got to work! ",Classic
145271, Yes. ,Classic
92982, I can't see anything. ,Classic
16803," Oh, we've got one consolation. We're all together again. ",Classic
148211," While the rest of us toil without hope, the officer elite enjoy power and luxury. ",Classic
82216," If what you say is true, it would explain much. We lived at peace with the Earthmen for many years, then suddenly they began to raid our spaceships. When we protested, they said that we were attacking them. ",Classic
60972," Ah, do with it. Aye. ",Classic
66024," Liz, it wasn't the console that was to blame. It was that nuclear power surge. ",Classic
111102, Where are we now? ,Classic
10186, Do you think we could find some water? I wouldn't mind bathing my ankle for a bit. ,Classic
91462," Right, sir. ",Classic
108677, I've just heard that some of the work units have gone to the roof of Block Forty to look at our sun. ,Classic
82183," They too have battlefleets, my son. Such a war could well bring down both empires. ",Classic
106165, Close the door. Turn off the oxygen supply. ,Classic
17049, Steven went back to the city. ,Classic
127246," Tremas, my husband, I   Seron is dead, rejected by the Keeper. ",Classic
20082, You seem very fond of horses. ,Classic
1761," I'm very glad to hear he's improving. Well, now, I'm sure you all agree with me, its time we went back to the ship. Now, come along. ",Classic
88414, Thank God. ,Classic
83159, Just keep your eyes closed and hang on tight. You'll be all right. ,Classic
146662, It's my duty. He's commanded me. ,Classic
63384, There's only one thing I can do. I've got to get down into those caves and warn the Silurians. ,Classic
88514," Well, yes, in a way, I suppose it was. ",Classic
12387, But you've no idea where they come from? ,Classic
2988, It must be.,Classic
21067," Yes, this chap Karlton, he may be part of the plan with the Daleks. ",Classic
66503, What's the noise all about? ,Classic
162246, You were lucky. ,Classic
58936, Just getting ready for take-off. ,Classic
89506," Lord, not that stone of yours? ",Classic
145581, More of a tennis player than a cricketer. ,Classic
149227," Thank you, gentlemen. I'm most grateful. If you could just   Peri! Stay back! ",Classic
37217, Please go away. ,Classic
73709," Oh, it was just a light snack, I assure you. Now later on, I have a real treat in store for you. A banquet of genuine twentieth century food. Because I'm afraid most people don't eat like this nowadays, we've managed to get down the main food elements to pills and tablets. ",Classic
13719," We know that from the roof comes hate! The liquid death! Creeping destroyer of we Optera. Yet you stand upright. We will consult the chasm of lights and if you come from above, you will die!",Classic
143441," Oh. No, Gravis, please. Take everything else but leave me the Tardis. ",Classic
57973, Your records are very comprehensive. ,Classic
105707, A hundred pound! That be a fortune. I don't want to get mixed up in nothing wrong. ,Classic
107068, Crazy as a bed bug. He actually believes that he can see into the past with that electronic fruit machine he's got down there. ,Classic
15438," That's enough talking. Come on, move out slowly. ",Classic
18946, Why do you doubt him? ,Classic
104866," Careful, careful. I might have dropped it. ",Classic
94223, Yes. ,Classic
160556, They're fools. They think they will achieve something with their march. ,Classic
62701," Yes. Keep out of the way, I should think. ",Classic
98243, Successful? ,Classic
155903, Any witnesses I might produce are scattered all over the universe and all through time. How can I find them now? ,Classic
116329, Let's hope any damage that creature did hasn't caused any structural weaknesses. ,Classic
72471," Right, that settles it. We'd better try and raise the Doctor.",Classic
81213," Doctor? Doctor, can you hear me? ",Classic
90373," Yes, I suppose so. The sooner we get on with it, the better. I haven't had a moment's peace since Lupton disappeared. ",Classic
141960, They must be mopping up survivors. ,Classic
88568," I don't believe this. He and I used to be the greatest of friends! Aggedor! Aggedor! Yes, of course.   Klokleda partha mennin klatch. Haroon, haroon, haroon. Klokleda sheena tirri natch. Haroon, haroon, haroon.   Haroon, haroon, haroon. Haroon, haroon, haroon. Haroon, haroon, haroon. Haroon, haroon, haroon. Haroon. That's better. You remember me now, don't you, old chap. ",Classic
33417, Me. ,Classic
13658, There are many of my friends in the Crater of Needles. ,Classic
161198," Listen, Ace, do I have to remind you that the safety of the world is at stake? ",Classic
109436, Kill her! ,Classic
59489," Well, how do you mean, different? ",Classic
16501," Oh, rubbish my child. Vampire bats are only to be found in South America. ",Classic
12452, It just doesn't go with those clothes. ,Classic
34209, It's easier than raising it. ,Classic
31772," Yes, Valmar thinks he can work in a switch to turn it on and off. ",Classic
102970, It's beautiful. ,Classic
165778, I thought cats hated water. ,Classic
17982," Oh, come now, there's no need to exaggerate. ",Classic
51932," Oh really, Jamie. Your imagination is ",Classic
85279, Let all be made ready. I ride at dawn. Alone if need be. ,Classic
66726," Can you hear me, Doctor Williams? Let us, let us out! Argh. ",Classic
56821, What are they up to? ,Classic
97379, This is the Disorientation Centre. ,Classic
24114," Doctor, Steven, get a look at these fab pictures! ",Classic
138779, It's just draining away. I don't understand. ,Classic
155356," Well, whether his name's Grenville or Hallett, why did he stage his own death in the pulveriser? ",Classic
51394," Oh, stop! ",Classic
65918," Then we shall just have to wait till it cools down a bit, won't we. ",Classic
28279," I, er, had a call from some old friends. I just popped along to see them. Was I really that long? ",Classic
152225," Be calm, be calm. Someone as pretty as you shouldn't be all of a fluster. ",Classic
140699," No, it'd take far too long.   So, the Master has used the Time Scoop to bring others as well as us here. Come on, let's get out of here.",Classic
12928," I have every reason to believe that drink is poisoned! Yes, thank heavens I got you in time. ",Classic
114321," What, after four thousand years? I shouldn't think so. Mind you, I'll tell you something. If there is anything still alive, it'll be furious at all the delay. Oh! ",Classic
98818, That grew in the bed that was part of the garden close to the house that Jack ,Classic
3926," The Tardis. Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear. ",Classic
145588," Ah, so there you are, Stotz. I thought that you could make it. ",Classic
10407," Yes, it'd be like a huge advertising poster, wouldn't it. ",Classic
18016," They're going to have another go at the Chumblies, by the look of things. ",Classic
73813," You're not on the side of the criminals, surely? They wanted to kill you. ",Classic
48531," Oh, Doctor! ",Classic
14050," Oh, can you see it, Doctor? Can you see it? ",Classic
57352," I shall, don't worry! ",Classic
75041," Well, somebody's here all right. ",Classic
140815, They're moving so slowly. ,Classic
112905," What? That's it, then. ",Classic
66017, Yes. ,Classic
96933, Yes. ,Classic
121218," Well, Captain, you'll have to show us the best place. ",Classic
133863, You will follow. ,Classic
44894, Salamander's changed his mind. He's going to take me with him.,Classic
67377," Well, I shall be most interested to see how you get on without him, Brigadier. ",Classic
120625, What did you say? ,Classic
74535, This is a very delicate political situation. ,Classic
84947, His neck! ,Classic
144853, What kept you? ,Classic
17557," Come on.   What's this? Vicki, come and take a look at this. ",Classic
115226," What possible danger can His Majesty be in from his own personal bodyguard, Count? ",Classic
115810, Where are the magazines? ,Classic
33000, Heard a rebel dirge. ,Classic
5681, I don't believe it. ,Classic
143291, Not any more. ,Classic
40019," Hey, wait a minute. What's happening? It's getting dark. Hey, look at the far wall! ",Classic
34782, I know. But it's much more exciting in the dark. ,Classic
25486," Well, it seems all right. I'm going to make a dash for it. ",Classic
19242, The statue. They've finished the statue.   ,Classic
98628," Well, what is a Krynoid? I mean, what does it do? ",Classic
70276," Yeah, but ",Classic
32274, This Doctor of yours. He knows something about the Daleks? ,Classic
73580," Grant, Jo Grant. ",Classic
125686, Exactly. Come on. ,Classic
50875," Yes, but they'd pick us off easily in that. Come on let's try that door again.   Come on. Keep it   Now you know I'm not lying!",Classic
14743," Let me go, you dogs! You pigs! ",Classic
159123, He's gone back to his spacecraft. ,Classic
117815, Oh yeah. ,Classic
77427," Out, quickly. Help Miss Grant. ",Classic
102293," Yes. Well, no, no. Answers are easy. It's asking the right questions that is hard. ",Classic
63046," Oh, rubbish. ",Classic
36155," Ola reporting, Pilot. ",Classic
103463," This is SV7, Controller. Equipment additional to manifest in forward compartment nineteen. ",Classic
24720, Why not? We can serve them on Refusis as well as here. Just a moment. Where's Dassuk? ,Classic
92600, Certainly. What would you like me to talk about? ,Classic
138831," What? You don't know that, either. ",Classic
3195," Ian, what is it? What's happened? ",Classic
28541," Oh yeah, victory, that's right. And we'll all be here won't we? ",Classic
68921," Right. Locke, open the door. Let the Governor in. What's the next? Look! ",Classic
13090," Well, if it's your idea, dearest, it must be. ",Classic
44085, You won't find what I pay you disappointing. ,Classic
138040, Is Nyssa safe? ,Classic
130493, Sanders will not return. ,Classic
150655, Hors d'oeuvres. ,Classic
87495, A statue? ,Classic
142377," Um, er. ",Classic
117623, Affirmative. ,Classic
57800," There she is, sir. And that isn't the ship we saw before. ",Classic
105197," Aye, that's Reuben right enough. ",Classic
50280," Oh Tolata, don't be a little fool. This island is a killer. ",Classic
42585, What is that? ,Classic
145743," I think so, Salateen. And before he's executed, I'll see that evil renegade is dragged in chains through every city on Major. ",Classic
30115, I think we'd better go with them. ,Classic
149516, No! An accident. It wasn't intended for him. ,Classic
7646, This fruit is delicious. It tastes like peaches. ,Classic
28919," Hold fast, I say! ",Classic
149484," Happen I can assist, my lord? Take Miss Peri to collect herbs? ",Classic
151762," That will be of little use, Mykros. ",Classic
107718, Take your Q capsule. ,Classic
148977," Your guard is quite right, of course. We shouldn't have deceived him. But how else would we have got in here? ",Classic
119978," Oh, you knew. Well, don't you think you could at least put up a notice? ",Classic
47208," We've gained contact with Rig D. Come in, Rig D. Come in, please. Rig D, can you hear me please? ",Classic
13562," Size is only relative. In this rarified atmosphere, it appears that evolution has chosen that particular form of life on this planet. ",Classic
47992," These creatures have been seen in the refinery itself, in the oxygen room ",Classic
74276, You have saved our lives. Thank you. ,Classic
45682," Somebody had tampered with it, and it's my guess it was this Doctor feller. ",Classic
165348, Leave me alone!,Classic
7122," Carol, get back to your instruments. Doctor, would you take the controller seat? ",Classic
123993," Thank you, mistress.   Repairs complete. ",Classic
161794," If you want to watch or you want to compete, there's a great time for you on the planet Segonax. The planet has easy access via our special polyportable landing bays. ",Classic
82745, You said just now that you were on some sort of mission. May one ask what it is? ,Classic
54593, How? We haven't got enough missiles. ,Classic
112014, You? ,Classic
38898, I don't care for insolence. ,Classic
98831, Doctor? Miss Smith? Where are you? ,Classic
157125," Oh, no. ",Classic
24869," What? Oh, nonsense, child. Nonsense. ",Classic
68219, What's happening out there? ,Classic
51758," Yes, possibly. I'd better get working on the Tardis controls right away. ",Classic
129322, And what do we do in the meantime? ,Classic
99751, Let her be prepared to receive the sacred blade. ,Classic
100052," The only plots, Hieronymous, are mine, and they are going well. ",Classic
100464, Great Scott. You must have pulled a few strings to get hold of this. Virology usually hangs on to it like grim death. What did you tell them? ,Classic
39931," Not exactly, Jamie, but very nearly. ",Classic
60360, And his people. ,Classic
39142, Under any circumstances. ,Classic
92127, We can't. ,Classic
78182," Well, you wouldn't be aware of it, of course, because your time had slowed down too. ",Classic
104465, Last night? ,Classic
30752, Well?  R/ ,Classic
78958, Time ram? You couldn't do it in that old crock. ,Classic
162106," What is all this, then? I thought there was a talent contest going on. ",Classic
135507," There was one dissenter, your good friend Councillor Hedin. ",Classic
107741, What? ,Classic
158137, How long are we in this place for? ,Classic
110679," That's the spirit. K9, you're in charge. ",Classic
109104, Main systems functional. Then why aren't we moving? ,Classic
35167, Right. ,Classic
140411," Oh, no. No, don't look so worried. I'll have it all worked out soon. Everything's all right. Everything's quite all right. ",Classic
95037, What happened? ,Classic
127178, She must have come from the grove. ,Classic
60319," Yes, that has been puzzling me. Just how did you recognise them? ",Classic
14734, Wait!   Still warm. No other window. Only one door. Look on the rooftop. ,Classic
81022," Stand aside, Kalik. ",Classic
147418, Where did you get this from? ,Classic
89130," Trisilicate production will be resumed immediately, your Majesty, using all available modern tools. I shall expect your Majesty's full cooperation. ",Classic
136211," Lon, I really think the Director should deal with this. ",Classic
157719, Pex? ,Classic
106848," Goodbye, Doctor, and thank you for everything you've done for us. ",Classic
107404," Well, you said there's only one. It could not build a spacecraft. How did it get to Earth? ",Classic
23202, Now tell us exactly what you heard. ,Classic
84512, Goodnight. ,Classic
60585, You mean like the Tardis? ,Classic
39755, That's right. Question! ,Classic
145730, How do you intend to do that? ,Classic
74519," The progress that they offer, that we offer, isn't like that. ",Classic
44357," I see, the second corridor on the right, thank you so much. ",Classic
164780, Ace. ,Classic
55160, Yes. That poor fellow must have confused it's attack mechanism.,Classic
68764, Are you sure? ,Classic
2528, The doors were open. ,Classic
2733," I don't know even where to begin, Chesterton. If only I had a clue. ",Classic
17812," There it is, my dear. There's the Tardis. Safe and sound. Didn't I tell you so? ",Classic
153026," Oh. Well, please convey my thanks to him. Is that water? Could I have some? ",Classic
62611, Was he much of an artist before the accident? ,Classic
81777," Well, that sound. The one I heard on the cargo ship. I think I can hear it again.   Ogrons! ",Classic
141707," Sound full alert, Nilson.   Get your best people to Airlock One immediately. They must stop that creature. ",Classic
158728, Everyone calls me Ace. ,Classic
141583, You knew that would happen. ,Classic
130079, Don't say that Doctor's on the prowl again. What a pest! Persuasion! ,Classic
80953," Perfectly, Chairman Pletrac, perfectly clear.",Classic
10256, Can you get the flap open? ,Classic
78746, And Lakis? Return quickly. I have an errand for you. ,Classic
23444," A third man, but I didn't know him. ",Classic
124926, Excellent! ,Classic
67315, Section three standing by. ,Classic
75596," Oh, really, Miss Grant, if you think for one moment I'm going to believe ",Classic
9705, Good. ,Classic
52035, Which is correct. The yolk of an egg is white or the yolk of an egg are white? ,Classic
122538," Doctor, look at this. ",Classic
58163, What'll happen to us if one of those wee minnow things catches up with us? ,Classic
41910," Songsten, you will now go forth with the monks. You will never return. ",Classic
150020," Well, some of these pumping systems are very old. There's bound to be the odd wheeze. ",Classic
77254, The shuttle! ,Classic
53598," Right, Jimmy. Get out of the area and stand by. ",Classic
72606," What, this Daemon could destroy the world? ",Classic
146685, So these are your prodigies. They seem quite insignificant. ,Classic
111195, Tangential formation has been quite altered. The Doctor has made many modifications over the centuries. We should be by now ,Classic
103423, Listen. ,Classic
50104, Excuse me. Tell him I will go for the spares. ,Classic
85943," Oh, my thanks, good toadface. Er, good Linx. More weapons from the stars. ",Classic
160219, Activate the Omega device! ,Classic
8908," I'm sorry, citizen, I came as fast as I could. I was busy with the food. ",Classic
69804," No, no, no, it's all right. It's all right, Brigadier. Well, goodbye, Mister Chinn. Take care.",Classic
104638, And one midget. ,Classic
69013," Oh, come, Doctor, how can I possibly fail? I launch the missile and wipe out the peace conference, the world is at war. ",Classic
11773, And what about us? ,Classic
125810, Karl? ,Classic
101985, Shush!   Now tread carefully.   Saved by the bell. Come on. Come on. ,Classic
62803," No idea, sir. We found him like this when we got here. ",Classic
160390, You wrote it? ,Classic
134448, We'll only get caught. ,Classic
69047," Oh, come on, Doctor. We are both Time Lords. ",Classic
60547," Oh, very well. Go on, Zoe, off you go. We'll follow in a few minutes. Good luck. ",Classic
151949, Hurry up and get on with it. ,Classic
128280," I've never been persuaded by hyperbole, Doctor. ",Classic
158090," My people will survive, Gavrok. ",Classic
121381," Okay, so the Doctor's an agent. Yes, that's it. He's a narcotics agent. ",Classic
66209, And what about Harry Slocum? ,Classic
82814, I imagine they've been totally subjugated. The usual Dalek technique of rule by terror. ,Classic
93793," Thirty minutes, perhaps less. ",Classic
65909, Do you reckon he'll know what it is? ,Classic
24001," Look, do you realise what's happening? We've taken off! We could land anywhere! ",Classic
99411," Yes, aggressive rhubarb. ",Classic
50521," Oh, what's so interesting about that? ",Classic
124323," Patience!   Brotadac, we are about to release a power many magnitudes greater than any intelligence has ever controlled. ",Classic
124998, The spiders only appear at Mistfall. No one's ever analysed one before. ,Classic
9833," Yes, we followed them here. Perhaps I'd better go and see what's happened. ",Classic
97530, Chap's insane. ,Classic
12594," Just as I suspected at the time. Now, goodnight. And remember, we make an early start tomorrow. ",Classic
74930," Let's hope not. By the way, what about those admiralty charts I asked for? ",Classic
128299, So it's true. ,Classic
96688, Oh! Sometimes you don't seem ,Classic
78161," What is it, that light? ",Classic
29279, Right!   Tom! Thomas me ol' mate. Tom! Come quick! Tom! Quick! ,Classic
153590," Of course, my lady. The High Council simply felt that certain areas of testimony should not be revealed. ",Classic
124228, That wasn't the Doctor. ,Classic
39632," Yes, yes, I live a long, long way away from Earth. Oh, just a minute. Maxtible! Arthur Terrall! The Daleks put some sort of control device on him. ",Classic
141044, On many occasions. ,Classic
120424," Well, then we must get him out. ",Classic
8187, A good idea.  1 ,Classic
28380," Yes, well, it's not going to be easy. Men of that quality are very hard to find. Especially men with their knowledge of computers. ",Classic
125927," We shall leave this miserable space trap for the real universe. Rich, fat worlds teeming with life. We shall suck their life blood until they are empty husks, and pass on to more worlds, and yet still more. ",Classic
141112," Rassilon achieved it. Timeless perpetual bodily regeneration. True immortality! Rassilon lives, Doctor. He cannot die. He is immortal. ",Classic
135547, This is where you slept? ,Classic
80989," Oh, hello, old chap. Sundowner? ",Classic
123079, Yes. ,Classic
41337, These creatures are indeed fearsome. ,Classic
106088," Oh, I do, I do. Some of my best friends are humans. When they get together in great numbers, other lifeforms sometimes suffer. ",Classic
47344," Oh I haven't got them, sir. I sent my wife for them, but she's not well. I wondered if I could go and ",Classic
89659," You know, I've always said that next to Mrs Samuel Pepys you make the finest cup of coffee in the world. ",Classic
134820, That can't be so. ,Classic
109543," There's no stopping us now. A hundred thousand years of searching, General. There's no stopping us now. I smell victory. ",Classic
30661," Sounds kinda spooky. No, I've nothing to report so far. ",Classic
141370, It's a bit chilly in here. ,Classic
8672," D'Argenson. D'Argenson, quiet! ",Classic
53718," Don't worry, Miss Watkins. As soon we return to base, I'm going to raise hell and get some action. ",Classic
117588, Compatibility ration seventy four percent. Component therefore unstable and liable to deteriorate. ,Classic
5756, Cam we do anything to help? ,Classic
25840, Wyatt Earp! ,Classic
150434," Oh, that's not very likely. They seem to be keeping well out of the way at the moment. Come on. Lead on. ",Classic
83378," Plan, what plan? ",Classic
47852," Yes, yes, I'm afraid it is. ",Classic
161436," Interference, origin unknown. ",Classic
152871," Well, can't we just have the edited highlights?",Classic
82505, Yes. But I'm not sure where.,Classic
62851, So have we all. ,Classic
85688, Thank you. ,Classic
62336, To take their places. It is time for them to begin work. ,Classic
96099, Help! Argh! ,Classic
151586, I wouldn't dare. Not when you've got such big teeth. What exactly did happen? ,Classic
147942, I will not. ,Classic
29832, We will see. But we'd best proceed with caution. ,Classic
165790, You kill people. You eat people. ,Classic
51292," Good. First thing to do is estimate the strength of the enemy. Come on, through there.",Classic
31280, To examine. And I intend to start my examination at once. ,Classic
28751," Well, it all sounds very ingenious, but I'm afraid I don't understand it. ",Classic
40858, Of course he is. I've just said he's so. ,Classic
138317, Is it a machine? ,Classic
66115, Brigade Leader. ,Classic
80458," Vorg, they're coming over. ",Classic
159869," Fall back! Three, two, one, down! ",Classic
63005," Oh, I'll get along then. Excuse me. ",Classic
140384," Ah. Yes, mine was pretty unpromising, too. ",Classic
27938, What's happening? I insist upon knowing. ,Classic
70593," Well, there is now. ",Classic
154026," Well, I think it just winked at Peri. ",Classic
37914, Oh she was cunning. She's got her own original with her. ,Classic
61942," Yes, it was rather unfortunate. ",Classic
31423," Well, the Daleks. ",Classic
155584," The prosecutor delights in scoring cheap victories, my lady. I swear to you, when I viewed that section earlier, I was nowhere near the Communications room. ",Classic
143272, You can't argue with fate. Here. It's a two corpira piece. You blow through it for good luck. ,Classic
96414, I'm afraid this is beyond me. ,Classic
153035, Physiognomy is irrelevant. ,Classic
15757," Well, we must find out where Ian and the Doctor were taken. And if that means just wandering around the exhibition aimlessly, well, we may as well go with them, Tor. ",Classic
145098, What are you trying to do? ,Classic
145621, Twenty minutes. ,Classic
15147, That's us. That's not models or pictures. That's us. ,Classic
137167, In a manner of speaking. It's on Earth. ,Classic
38214, It's better than death. ,Classic
58766, Right. ,Classic
31238, We saw your rocket overshoot the landing area. ,Classic
68269," They're on the move. Come on, Benton. ",Classic
48346, But of course. ,Classic
146260," I was speaking figuratively. It shouldn't come to that. Come along, we're wasting time. ",Classic
148397, This mysterious most is. ,Classic
12661," Oh, er, nothing to interest you, my dear. We're going to Rome. Come along, don't let us delay. ",Classic
102810," Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen. Democracy at work, I see. ",Classic
130577, Are you sure? ,Classic
66457," Oh, no! ",Classic
165127, How? ,Classic
127328, I accept. ,Classic
155321, My eyes never left the screen. ,Classic
15436, So we could be doing exactly what we're supposed to do. ,Classic
161902," Keep your shirt on, Doctor. Everything's a specimen of something. Take that robot over there, for example. ",Classic
130593, Yes. ,Classic
49818, Enough to keep anything out. The crew have been warned. Oh. ,Classic
12611, Strange name. I've never heard of it before. I hopes he finds you. ,Classic
133693, The reason for the red alert. ,Classic
138658," With the Garm's help, yes. It's only his lack of free will which has prevented him from doing anything about it. ",Classic
10387," Hello? Is Mister Whitmore there, please? Arnold Farrow speaking. Yes. Oh, hello, how are you? Good. I'll hold on. The secretary asked me how I was. Told you it'd be all right. ",Classic
83700," Goodbye, Doctor. ",Classic
130210," Nevertheless, I should like my protest to be entered officially in the log. ",Classic
85532, Captain. ,Classic
82655, In the Tardis. ,Classic
9927," Grandfather, everything's all right. There isn't a fault anywhere, not even a yellow standby. ",Classic
27085, Of course not. I was delayed by the strangers. ,Classic
41305," No! No, Miss Victoria, we mustn't. ",Classic
67587," I've told them not to touch it, Doctor. ",Classic
27543, We don't want to bring any more suffering on your people. ,Classic
127559," Dear me, he seems to be almost back on form. ",Classic
126214, Zero coordinates. ,Classic
21616, I have no choice. Let's hope you're right. ,Classic
120965, Who was that? ,Classic
120533, Oh. ,Classic
85225, Thank you. ,Classic
142044," No, wait. Your warriors are dying everywhere. Abandon the base.",Classic
11781, The work on the capsule is complete. The device is ready. ,Classic
88912," Well, what are you going to do? ",Classic
85578, What century? ,Classic
121386, Doctor? Where are you?   Doctor! Are you all right? There's a creature in there. It's horrible. We've got to get away. What were you doing in there? Come on!,Classic
95658," Command deck calling you, Commander. ",Classic
48922," Assumption again, guesswork. It would be so easy to check. ",Classic
47308," Let's get one thing straight, my friend. When I need your advice I'll ask for it. ",Classic
136401," Oh, I'm flattered you remember me. ",Classic
97259, Thirty seconds. Twenty five seconds.   Twenty seconds. ,Classic
110878, Of your own free will? ,Classic
164782, Ace! ,Classic
8563," Well, towns and villages can be well-spaced, even in England. ",Classic
161662, It is only my present form. I have had others which would horrify you. I shall have those again. You are surprised I speak? ,Classic
35673, He says he'll be all right for the time being. ,Classic
6858," And the one man I had respect for, I deceived. Poor Autloc. I gave him false hope and in the end he lost his faith. ",Classic
118827, Oh? ,Classic
122894, But they're dead! ,Classic
82493, No! No! No! Stop it!,Classic
126764, Do nothing? ,Classic
155003, I'm sure. How about the rest of the equipment? ,Classic
35261," No, that's an idea. ",Classic
6134, You saw the blow? ,Classic
75897," Thank you. All right, stand by to surface, Number One.",Classic
59606," Yes, certainly.   Do you see? He didn't remember what happened at the court martial. ",Classic
49262, All phases proceeding as planned. ,Classic
87792, He'll be coming up behind the Doctor. I must warn him! ,Classic
82855, Dalek patrol two calling command centre. We have located Thal spacecraft. Indicate course of action.   Command centre orders the craft is to be destroyed. ,Classic
30328," Roger, Zeus 4. We will give you more information. Over and out. ",Classic
121643, Has the Doctor been seen in that sector? ,Classic
23291, Fetch her tomorrow. Bring her to me.   ,Classic
75563, What? We must warn the authorities at once! ,Classic
159468, What do you think you're doing? ,Classic
43635," Yes, Doctor, we must know. ",Classic
50122, Follow me. This way's quicker. ,Classic
153197," I see. Well, if this power failure's allowed to get any worse, we'll all be dead soon. ",Classic
9127, Hardly long enough for you to have gauged the present mood of our capital. ,Classic
48809, Am I supposed to eat this? ,Classic
98833," Drop that gun. I said, drop that gun! ",Classic
138954, Where are they? What have you done with them? ,Classic
157973," So, you say you could lead me to this so-called Doctor who dares to mock me? ",Classic
43184, To help you. ,Classic
95403, Formal occasion? ,Classic
106240, I'm fighting for my mind. Whatever it was that attacked Safran and the others is also affecting me. ,Classic
14275, Such clothes as these are difficult for me to sell. ,Classic
146448, Survivors. ,Classic
101332, Not unless he's got the help of an accomplice. ,Classic
119102," Well, this tall man I'd never seen before, he fainted. ",Classic
149734," Proud of her, or your own skill? ",Classic
48036, I don't know.   No wonder they didn't see the lift shaft signal. There's no one here. ,Classic
17170," You'll see, you'll see. ",Classic
145908," Chellak to Red Force. Do you receive me, over? Our support group must have hit trouble. ",Classic
63403, Who are these people? ,Classic
19160, Will these do? ,Classic
17808, To the Monk. ,Classic
53800," Money isn't everything, you know. ",Classic
60264, He will be caught. ,Classic
74391, It must have been a dreadful experience! We have to ask him later. ,Classic
162972," No, sir. London says that the area of radio interference is expanding. ",Classic
132118," So, you got here at last. ",Classic
56029, You are wasting time.   What is happening? ,Classic
100484, Any plastic? ,Classic
65337," He insists on going up in Recovery 7, makes contact with the alien vessel, then disappears as soon as he lands. Can you explain that? ",Classic
33837, Oh. ,Classic
37301, Did he say what about? ,Classic
58504, There's a Space Corps lieutenant in the punishment cell under tunnel nine. He's injured. I want him brought here for questioning. ,Classic
151186, All these corridors look the same to me. Are these plants indigenous to Karfel? ,Classic
128009, You are. ,Classic
165892, Yes. It would have been too easy. It seems we must always meet again. ,Classic
153591, Why not? ,Classic
78272, Hey! What do you think you're up to?   Get down! Blithering idiot means it.   Greyhound? Greyhound? Over.,Classic
90357, Silence! My loyalty is to the eight legs. My loyalty is to this council. You will listen and obey. ,Classic
29827," Come on, Smallbeer. Let's have you. ",Classic
111120," No, I'm not. ",Classic
55449," Better. Much better, but very tired. She'll be all right by morning though. ",Classic
131396," Undoubtedly. When we find the person who's burning the sulphur, perhaps you'll believe him.",Classic
92789," No, it's not the Central Line. ",Classic
88424, I tell you I did see someone in there before all the noise and lights started. ,Classic
14255, Saphadin? ,Classic
98718," Scorby, someone's coming. ",Classic
18528," Doctor, come on! ",Classic
148902, Nobody gets in here without a pass. ,Classic
56372, The fuel dump on the moon. There's a refuelling system connected to the landing bay. ,Classic
152640, You trusted them? ,Classic
137560, Have you located the Tardis? ,Classic
128994," Fascinating demonstration, Portreeve. How often do the pictures renew themselves? ",Classic
163698," What do you want me to do, wrap up in a curtain? ",Classic
64643, You just keep doing what you're told. They'll be all right.   Who is it? All right. I'll open the front door. ,Classic
29708, Captain. Captain. I beg thee. No! No! No! Ahh! ,Classic
84634, I don't know what you mean. ,Classic
41287, It's the Abbot. Is he all right? ,Classic
64578, Possibly. ,Classic
39354, Who is this? ,Classic
102720," If I can't do it, the atomic generators will explode, taking Xoanon, us and half the planet with them. Effective, but crude. ",Classic
131813, Wait! ,Classic
36094," Yes, all right. He's coming to the front of the house. ",Classic
123758, Nothing. I don't know anything. What have I done? ,Classic
12521," And what if it is, hmm? ",Classic
84415," That's not necessary, surely? ",Classic
15074," It's extremely doubtful that they were both deaf. However, the fact is, they didn't hear. Now, let's see what's in here.",Classic
99868," No, of course not. Nevertheless ",Classic
62903," The power from your reactor, like the mental state of your staff, has been affected by some outside influence. ",Classic
43719," Well, at least we're safe now, aren't we? ",Classic
45738, I brought a load of explosives down from Holborn. I'm going to blow it and them with it. ,Classic
1093," What? Grandfather, do you mean to say that you risked leaving the ship just to see this place? ",Classic
135648, As yours depends on mine. ,Classic
46165," Sir! Sir, sorry to interrupt, sir, but I found this. ",Classic
22546, The voice audio has been adjusted. ,Classic
27626, Shall we begin? ,Classic
73120, Okay. ,Classic
151831," I think he'll return to Earth, don't you? After all, he does have an interesting story to tell. Herbert. Herbert!  ",Classic
8525, Do you have to be in such a hurry? ,Classic
154227," Unless I can operate soon, you will suffer fatal brain compression in a few days. ",Classic
129388, Good man. Come on. We'll see you both later. ,Classic
20646, I know. I know. Try them again. ,Classic
147611, I think he means he's also a prisoner. ,Classic
70742," Oh, Robert, why won't you admit your mistakes? ",Classic
162036, I can't see a thing. ,Classic
32854," Article Seventeen, Aliens Act? ",Classic
37549," Oh, it's all right. It's quite my fault. Haven't I met you somewhere before? ",Classic
143884, I'm not going back there. They'll kill me. ,Classic
151357," We're safe for now, but we must turn this pause to our advantage. ",Classic
112475, What's happening? ,Classic
372," Calm down, Susan. ",Classic
140911," Yes, yes. ",Classic
148205, Jondar was your friend. ,Classic
54724, Command here. Receiving you. Over. ,Classic
29963," Ah stow it, Gaptooth. ",Classic
75744, You know our history? ,Classic
64374," Main control, start transmitting now. ",Classic
50551, It is pointless to struggle. My Quarks have used a molecular force to bind your bodies to the wall. ,Classic
21079, Desperus is the penal planet of the Solar System. ,Classic
149533, Stop bleating and do it. ,Classic
147453, Yeah. ,Classic
164429, Wicked.   ,Classic
65224, That is difficult to believe. ,Classic
125469, Greetings. ,Classic
96032, What are you doing? ,Classic
13722, Then tell us what we must do. ,Classic
96186," Yes, them. They've multiplied. ",Classic
50162," Yes, but they're sending in reinforcements, probably through the Loading Bay. Have you got the rod? Thank you. I'm going to try and fix this into the laser gun circuit. With any luck, I should be able to boost the power enough to destroy the Cyberman spaceship. But you'll have to hold them off at the loading bay. I need time. ",Classic
11411, You don't know how lucky you were. At first I took you for scavengers. I met a couple down here already but this kept them off. ,Classic
90634, Is there any among you would dare take it from me? ,Classic
142643," Oh, the boy's distraught. ",Classic
145253," Krau Timmin, copper output has risen by thirteen percent. That should not have occurred. ",Classic
26883, Always the same. ,Classic
153741," In your terms, I can't. Whoever programmed you forgot to include moral values. ",Classic
95443, Who are you? ,Classic
122302, For what? ,Classic
91178," Hey, now, hang on, you two. ",Classic
92523," Well, the Brigadier did tell me to stick with you, Doctor, and orders is orders. ",Classic
93734," You're not going in there, are you? ",Classic
119687," Blind? I help him to steal the Mona Lisa, the greatest crime in the century, and you call me blind? ",Classic
36274," Yes, what is it? What's that? The Doctor? I'll come at once. Keep at it. ",Classic
41543," A stranger? Of course, the Doctor. They're one and the same man. ",Classic
70622," Oh, we don't want to put you to any trouble. ",Classic
39071," Yes, I don't mean it like that. It's the price. First Kennedy, now this fellow. How many people must die so that my daughter can live? ",Classic
129521, I'm not a believer. ,Classic
36196," Oh, you're always hearing something. ",Classic
89693," Right. So, there they all were in the cellar, chanting away like billy-o. And all of a sudden this giant spider appeared and jumped on Lupton's back! ",Classic
50332," Yes, you're right again, Zoe. A war museum! ",Classic
85545," Ah, that narrow-hipped vixen. Bloodaxe, tomorrow we dine at Wessex Castle. ",Classic
146484, Don't care what he's like. He's left us here forever. ,Classic
78638," Aye, Dalios, I would! ",Classic
152045, Natasha. ,Classic
41707," Yes, I know, but there's nothing we can do about her. ",Classic
72010," Well, you explain it then. ",Classic
97363, Where will you be all this time? ,Classic
46843, What is it? ,Classic
104431," Quick, let me out of this place! Let me go! ",Classic
148207, Curious to see how the life of a guard has changed you. ,Classic
27259, Precisely. ,Classic
128745," Shush. Come on, we've got to finish this. Seventeen thousand tons of thrust. Say twenty five percent of the architecture. ",Classic
117855, Master. ,Classic
39390," Well then, where is she now? ",Classic
66274," I said, come on! ",Classic
152577, I see you've been busy. ,Classic
117419, Isn't it odd you've never taken any prisoners? ,Classic
4558, Yes? ,Classic
42027," But when we have destroyed the machine, what'll happen? ",Classic
61902, The units may have embedded themselves in soft ground. That would account for the fact that their signals are no longer being received. ,Classic
82397," In that case, I shall have to try something else. You may have heard this noise before, Miss Grant. It works directly on the fear centres deep in your mind!   ",Classic
45465," But we've got to get above ground, Victoria. Now let's try the next station. Come along. ",Classic
126211, He's still alive! ,Classic
86768," Because, Brigadier, it cannot be as accurate or as powerful as this would have been. But it could give us the general direction. ",Classic
71004, He went for me too. I grabbed a spanner and hit him. It was self-defence. I had to. ,Classic
118814, Nothing. ,Classic
9993," You're right, there aren't. ",Classic
129325, Yes. There's a fascinating book on maths through there by a chap called Burt Russell. ,Classic
135297, He resisted the guard! ,Classic
24197, No. Our knowledge is based purely on audio-space research. ,Classic
31974," Yes, but why these quantities, Janley? Why? How can they have used up all the materials I gave them? What is it? Why, it's only a matter of a few hours ago. ",Classic
725," Here are some leaves, and some dead grass. ",Classic
2480," Well, yes, yes, anything may help. ",Classic
75276," You were saying, Colonel? ",Classic
113748," She wouldn't be told. Look, I tell you what. Why don't you hang on here and I'll stop off on the way back and bring you some boots, right? ",Classic
143239, The Tractators need living flesh. They need minds as well as bodies.,Classic
9252, She isn't feeling at all well. ,Classic
112965," The tracer, it's gone mad. The second segment must be down here somewhere. ",Classic
126516, Pity. I want to be on the inside. ,Classic
69243, Why? Why ,Classic
134162," I doubt it, but I should think they came from this time zone. ",Classic
2882," Come on, Barbara. We haven't found anything yet. We must find something.",Classic
155583," The murderer? I think, Inquisitor, the Doctor is telling us more than he realises. ",Classic
14195, So we're in the Holy Land? He's trying to say something. What ,Classic
10014," I don't understand this at all, Susan. I'm going to have a look round the other side of this. ",Classic
71347, I'd better tell Winton to get those IMC men over here. This is going to look very bad to the Adjudicator. ,Classic
11932," Yes. It does somewhat. Might be a cave, or�even perhaps underground. ",Classic
70646, It's very nice. Thank you. ,Classic
28840," She says she's feeling much better and she'd like to stay here in London, and she sends you her love. ",Classic
27966," Yes, but the fear and hatred of the past will only die slowly. We need someone like yourself as a mediator until we have become one people. ",Classic
75949, It's no good! They've cut the power supply! ,Classic
50462," Cully, what are you? ",Classic
69716," There's no point in discussing the Master. I keep telling you, he's left Earth by now. ",Classic
38744, What do you mean? Tested how? ,Classic
99170," General laboratory. What? Oh, hold on. It's for you, sir. Says it's urgent. Main gate. ",Classic
3302, I cannot say. ,Classic
111205, With what? We must catch the others. We'll go my way. Come on. ,Classic
80477," Oh look, there's one. ",Classic
103664," The second principle is that humans can't harm robots. I know, I've tried, and they don't bleed. ",Classic
45639," They know about the control spheres, too. ",Classic
83419, I haven't seen them. ,Classic
162527, We're not concerned that you're playing for time. ,Classic
82362, That is untrue! ,Classic
75848," I think so, yes. ",Classic
127104, There was nothing like that there. ,Classic
28270," Oh, regular little ray of sunshine. ain't ya? ",Classic
106510, What was that? ,Classic
66792, What are you doing? ,Classic
97277," Oh, you're singing a different song now, Crayford. They must be eliminated, isn't that what you said? ",Classic
112983, I can't get over the Mentiads. All my life I've been taught to hate and loathe them. ,Classic
51540," Yes I know you are, but ",Classic
67312, Section one standing by. ,Classic
122829," Well, really, I was just standing admiring the view. ",Classic
42662, Leader Clent! ,Classic
75266," Very well. In that case, suggest to the Doctor that he come down here and see me for himself. ",Classic
37241," Well now, Inspector, what can I do for you? ",Classic
25455," Old trout, is it??!! Just you wait for that, Sergeant Rugg! Old trout! ",Classic
157885," That's Paradise Towers in a nutshell, I'm afraid. The Red Kangs didn't trust the Blue Kangs, and none of them trusted the Caretakers. And the Rezzies, from your account, prey on whoever they can and trust no one either. And all of them despise poor old Pex. Oh, the Great Architect must be delighted. How are we going to unite the people of Paradise Towers to defeat him? ",Classic
158819," Yes, sir. ",Classic
111234, No. We've got to get to the workshop. ,Classic
16218," Ah, well, well, well now! That puts a different complexion on the matter. Tell me, my dear, this tunnel, would you know how to find it again? ",Classic
153946, It's a pretty colour. ,Classic
47064, You mean it might come back? ,Classic
5245, This ash is still warm. They can't have been gone long. ,Classic
143331," Oh! Yes, it's very efficient, Gravis. You certainly know your mechanics.   No shortage of spare parts either, eh? ",Classic
9248, I'll get a bottle from the cellar. ,Classic
70979, What do you think of our colony? ,Classic
67445, Uh huh. ,Classic
110358, This is much better than inside. ,Classic
141353," Sync up, Maddox. Find out what the computer is doing. Come on, we could be at war! ",Classic
8292, Yes. ,Classic
38786," Do you think I'm going to allow Jamie to run into danger without telling him anything? No, I will not. ",Classic
157802, Good. Then you will see with your own eyes what's going on.,Classic
46735, Yes. ,Classic
141427, What's wrong? ,Classic
89556," Look, I just don't understand you. You said you want me to see for myself and then you suddenly take off. ",Classic
37535, Which is the Chameleon plane? ,Classic
45672," And the Captain's been gone about twenty minutes, you say? ",Classic
14720," Watch your tongue woman, or we'll ",Classic
15582," Well, this is the armoury, Vicki. ",Classic
63916, I could do nothing without power from the human's generator. It has ceased to function. ,Classic
47185, Then let me pass. Please. ,Classic
94776," I say, what about the Commander? Aren't we going to stop and say cheerio? ",Classic
70623, I'd rather you did as I say. Jane? ,Classic
42802, That's fantastic. ,Classic
43861, What do you mean? ,Classic
92802," Well, come on, help me. ",Classic
22455," Yes, yes. Do you know, I knew there was something I had to tell you. I've come here to warn you about the Daleks. ",Classic
85558," For pity's sake, cease this babbling, girl! ",Classic
121396, Good. I thought you told the Doctor you wouldn't use the CET again? ,Classic
31717," Problem. Smash the Daleks, and the people here will lock us up or kill us. Let the Daleks go, and we'll all be exterminated. ",Classic
154563, To what degree? ,Classic
88801," An excellent summing up, Commander Azaxyr. Do you know, you'd have made a very good judge? ",Classic
137995, Listen to yourself. You're so concrete in the way you think. Why can't you just agree to differ? ,Classic
5491," Get out! You heard me, get out! ",Classic
100466, Such as? ,Classic
135021, Gear up. ,Classic
81640, How did you get away from these things? ,Classic
140260, No? ,Classic
112491," See? For ten seconds the entire fabric of the space time continuum was ripped apart. Panaccenteration readings, critical overload, every system jammed solid. Gravity dilation readings. There, Mister Fibuli. Can you explain those figures? ",Classic
562, They have strange feet. ,Classic
69954, What about the rest of the men? ,Classic
32187, In!   You want me to stay with her? ,Classic
5123, Don't be afraid. You're safe now. ,Classic
16401," Well, the idea is, my dear, is to find something that we can fight back with. ",Classic
98037," Condo, I want you to take this to the Sisterhood. You understand? ",Classic
131230, Close these gaps! ,Classic
135315, Excuse me. Tegan Jovanka? ,Classic
117801," Yeah.   So that's where it was. I thought somebody'd nicked it. Huh, not a lot of bottle now, is it. ",Classic
54285, The micro-monolithic circuits are artificial nervous systems. Once activated they will produce the Cyber-hypnotic force that controls human beings. ,Classic
3456, Good. ,Classic
134925," Is inside the Master's Tardis, of course. I wish I had time to explain dimensional transcendentalism. Look, I'm going into my Tardis. You stay here. ",Classic
6814, He will not be present. ,Classic
13904," Yes, they are more used to it than we are, Heron. ",Classic
125678, It's that sound again. ,Classic
114912, It's swollen. ,Classic
50548, Not by me you're not. ,Classic
97076," This is B block, main entrance. They've just escaped, sir.   Ah, Corporal Alert the security patrol immediately. The rest of you, get after them! Spread out. ",Classic
29887," Oh, you fancy you'll twist him round to your way, would you? ",Classic
92247," Oh ho, that's clever. ",Classic
140509, What's happening to you? ,Classic
150091, What? ,Classic
72593, You're the Doctor. ,Classic
57941," Oh Doctor, can we have some more oxygen? ",Classic
139672, We're gaining on them. ,Classic
90730," No, sir. Just routine. ",Classic
34555, Polly's gone. ,Classic
146275, Of course. ,Classic
158276, I'm afraid he was paid in kind. You see this signal beacon? It exploded from the inside. Obviously the Bannermen locked into his signal and fired off a high impulse beam right along his transmission track. ,Classic
112228," Oh, I'm sorry, K9. What can we do now? ",Classic
103708," Oh, yes, yes, it is, until one gets its hands around your neck. I don't suppose there are any weapons aboard this mine? ",Classic
57769," Yes please, sir. Thank you. ",Classic
122222," Not that bit, K9, that bit.   Ow! ",Classic
102421," No, it isn't! Up the nose. It's over the teeth and down the throat. ",Classic
76227, His Nibs. The Marshal.,Classic
14259," Silks. Satins. Fine robes. Rich silks. Satins from Basra. Fine robes. Silks. Satins. The finest robes in Jaffa! Silks. Satins. Fine robes. Rich silks. Fine satins. The finest robes in Jaffa.   My lord. You are from Pisa, my lord? ",Classic
157731," The facilities of this mighty structure are unrivalled, as you can see from these pictures.) ",Classic
66698, Well? ,Classic
14536," I hope you will find Barbara safe and well, dear boy, er, Sir Ian. ",Classic
108107," Ah. Right. I'm glad he isn't deaf.   I would have felt guilty. Don't leave it in too long, it goes frizzy. ",Classic
164667," Ah, er, we're just being nosy. ",Classic
69284," Good, Major, good. Is that a map of the prison? ",Classic
1957," It'll make it more comfortable to sleep on. Barbara, you see to the food. I'll get the fire going. ",Classic
13180," It'll have to keep. Have a grape. Come along, my dear. ",Classic
151897, At once. ,Classic
73710," Look, I don't want to seem ungrateful. ",Classic
110081," She turned down there, sir. ",Classic
42240, Seven two point four? That's bad. ,Classic
77482," You're joking, of course. ",Classic
81455, It's only a load of flour! ,Classic
23640, Monsieur! ,Classic
98879," What's that thing, Scorby? ",Classic
56664," Oh, they have their weak points. ",Classic
6513," What progress do our pupils make at the seminary, Tonila? ",Classic
75442, Thank you. ,Classic
22433," Elimination. Thank you. Elimination! Oh, you'll get it back, have no fear. ",Classic
118129," Goodbye.   Right, I'll set the coordinates for Gallifrey, shall I? ",Classic
38140, The Doctor must be trying some sort of bluff. ,Classic
144535," I'm sorry, Howard. I didn't mean it. No, Howard. Please don't leave me alone. Don't, don't turn out the light.   Howard! ",Classic
15587," Yes, I know. ",Classic
43511, I'm the leader here. ,Classic
90390," Goes the weasel.   Who, who are you? ",Classic
129800, Don't be too sure. In the Mobiliary there is a deadly poison. The deadliest in the known universe. The Urbankans secreted it in a gland. It causes organic matter to shrink in on itself. One trillionth of a gram would reduce you to the size of a grain of salt. With this he will conquer Earth. ,Classic
37530, Four. I could get their registration numbers if you like? Why do you ask? ,Classic
25104," Is this the room? Is this the room, I said. ",Classic
96052," What is it, Reig? ",Classic
119235, Shush. Light the lamp. ,Classic
64143," Control to Recovery 7, do you read me? ",Classic
95623," So, what are we going to do? ",Classic
153436," We've all got to go sometime, Peri. ",Classic
2027, When did we arrange to meet him and the others? ,Classic
57732, What's the matter? ,Classic
1341, You've been longer than I thought. ,Classic
27635, It is too late. There is nothing we can ,Classic
148169, I'm sure the video of his execution would sell. You said we must export or die. ,Classic
98531, Yes. ,Classic
84698," Of course not, Brigadier. If ever I want anything, there's always somebody right at my elbow to lend a hand. ",Classic
45650," Now, now, just what do you know about the Yeti? ",Classic
110582," A rather more effective treachery than yours, I hope. ",Classic
75028," Doctor, I have no authority to provide naval vessels for your pleasure jaunts. ",Classic
79668," Thank you. Tell me, how did you manage to survive? ",Classic
25949, You're welcome to a slug o' rattlesnake oil! ,Classic
92135," You can't do it, Vira. The Ark will be crawling with those creatures within hours. ",Classic
43896, You? ,Classic
84863, It is. ,Classic
125313, Strangers? ,Classic
39692, But you heard him speak normally just now. ,Classic
104128," Now hear me, Jago. You remember the cab driver, Buller, who came to see me tonight? ",Classic
32856," He says he's a frog doctor, sir. ",Classic
11039, We met them once before. ,Classic
60465, Don't let me interrupt you. ,Classic
12271," When we crash landed, the inhabitants invited us all to a grand meeting. It was simple. I just arranged an explosive, using the ships armaments. The whole thing went up. All the inhabitants, the crew, the whole race. ",Classic
152172, What was it? ,Classic
61705, Has it anything to do with those meteorites? ,Classic
86155," Will you not tell him yourself, Doctor? He will reward you well. We owe you much. ",Classic
68977, I'd best see what's happening. ,Classic
143586," Doctor, where are you going? ",Classic
127365," No, wait. Have the court sealed. Double the guard on the sanctum and the grove and search everywhere, including the residential quarter. ",Classic
164532," Maidens Point. Oh, well, that rules me and Jean out for a start. See you. ",Classic
70132," When you arrived here, were there any signs ",Classic
104486, Chosen togs for a girl. ,Classic
78550," There we were, the skin of a gnat's whisker from the big bang and",Classic
78508," Well, that's not very nice, is it? ",Classic
103955, The man they were carrying was dead. He had been stabbed through the heart! ,Classic
73715," That was a lucky fluke, I assure you, nothing else. You could just as easily been killed. ",Classic
32900," Oh, you're hopeless. Why not, for goodness sake? ",Classic
3028, That is true.,Classic
80030, On. ,Classic
31817, I am your servant. What does this machine do? ,Classic
111997, Binro the Heretic. ,Classic
123067, He did his duty. I automatically become Chairman in his place. ,Classic
108977, His name is Orfe. ,Classic
131575," But if the barrier's open, why can't we see through it? ",Classic
33563, I'm the only one who knows what he looks like. ,Classic
89278," All right, your Majesty! You're coming with me. ",Classic
111240, The humanoids are three levels below. ,Classic
40828," Jamie, look. ",Classic
5718," Doctor, I'm sorry. ",Classic
69250," Well, in the event, in the highly unlikely event of UNIT finding us before the missile's ready, you'd make a very useful hostage. Remember that. ",Classic
78012, Why did you say Kronos? ,Classic
17072, Doctor! ,Classic
82034," Professor, don't shout. You'll just waste oxygen.   Come on, Professor, come on. Come on, up you get.   Listen. Listen, it worked! ",Classic
49221, Why? ,Classic
147260," Ah, you. Not allergic to walking as well, are you? ",Classic
84187," Look here, you're not in charge of me, man. ",Classic
45045," Yes, do that, will you? Right away. Oh, please don't wait for these.     That was close. ",Classic
82359, I can overrule you. ,Classic
9829, Certainly. Now let me have the key to the dungeon. ,Classic
159131, Where? ,Classic
151550, Grim sort of place. ,Classic
110181," The guards and the Time Lords. All the boring people. Do you know, I've passed the Seventh Grade and I'm nothing more than a glorified traffic guard? ",Classic
62098," Unless he returns to the area. If he does, the Autons will track him down and destroy him.",Classic
128384, Which would be great if we had a computer to run it on. ,Classic
93461, Are those the Daleks? ,Classic
163115, It's Excalibur. ,Classic
104110," He's still there, sir. We found another body outside after you'd gone. ",Classic
138420, What? ,Classic
55304, It is a spaceship. ,Classic
73317," Well, I'm not really hungry, thank you, Doctor. ",Classic
34404, Food. ,Classic
32586, Are you all right? ,Classic
165167, Shoot them! ,Classic
61679," I, I don't know, sir. ",Classic
50199," Well, you see Zoe, it's, well, it's like two different worlds. Look, you've got yours and the Doctor and me have ours. ",Classic
67105, I don't want to discuss the matter any further. Please carry out my instructions at once. ,Classic
96286, Through the window. I understood the property was for sale. No?,Classic
41047," Oh, no. ",Classic
122758, I've seen something similar. ,Classic
73001," If you do, sir, she'll blow us all sky high! ",Classic
104972," Almost ready. Yes, time to prepare my two partridges. Why don't you come down from there? Sulking because I wouldn't let you kill the Doctor, is that it?   Oh, you can kill him soon enough, Sin, but first I must drain every scintilla of his knowledge about the zigma experiment. You can kill him then, and as many more as you wish before we leave. All I need is to re-establish my protenoid balance.   Then I can enter the zigma beam for the second time. Only this time, there must be no mistake in the programme DNA levels. Now for my two partridges. ",Classic
9173," I will. We'll meet again, Barbara. And soon. ",Classic
26104," Oh indeed. Yes, yes, yes. Well, if you take my advice, I would leave it in the hands of the right people. ",Classic
5644, But surely they'll stop the execution now that Kala's confessed.,Classic
14345, I don't believe you're as calculating as that. ,Classic
156696," All right, compromise. Let me feel your pulse. ",Classic
108315, It's crazy talk. Rebellion? No one would support you. ,Classic
63710," Well, it's hard to say really. I think they'll lie low for a while, and let the disease really get to work. ",Classic
1481, He seemed to be able to cover all of us. ,Classic
105861, We don't? ,Classic
147240," This time it's for swinging, not leaning on. ",Classic
108991, Yes. ,Classic
57345, Professor Eldred and Miss Kelly are coping with it now. ,Classic
92078," Oh, I hope you know what you're doing. ",Classic
42207," Oh, I wonder if Penley's ears are burning. ",Classic
44035," Good luck, Astrid. Jamie and Victoria will look after you. ",Classic
6293, I thank you. ,Classic
51171, May I ask what you? ,Classic
26940, The Elders of our city have been plotting the course of your space-time ship for many light years. They estimated your arrival some time ago. ,Classic
146947," Are we capable? I mean, look at us, Doctor. I'm old. I've even used up my ability to regenerate. And you, well, your mind could cloud at any moment. ",Classic
141945," Yes, and he'd better hurry. It can't be long before they discover we've escaped. ",Classic
63122," And that will be all, Major Baker. Captain Hawkins, you will accompany Major Baker to the Sickbay and see that he remains there. ",Classic
110326," So, what are you going to do? ",Classic
84745," Oh, some milkman wandering about where he shouldn't be. They'll find him.   Okay? ",Classic
15714," Hmm. I see, I see.",Classic
25350," A trap? In here? In Mrs Wiggs' kitchen? Hey, you want to watch your language young fellow, me lad. ",Classic
30272," Thank you, keep checking. ",Classic
114543," If it will facilitate the proceedings, may I say that I have no objection to the assessor. Attach me to it if you wish. Ask me if I broke the seals. I will answer truthfully. ",Classic
116640, Darling. ,Classic
1234," Mark her movements carefully. If there are more Thal people living in the jungle, she will try to contact them. ",Classic
119696," Doctor, get me out of here. ",Classic
120224, And then Adrasta grew nasty with you and threw you down here as well? ,Classic
74324, Do you believe me? ,Classic
37391," Well, that's the man we found in the Chameleon Tours hangar.",Classic
105959, A projectile weapon. ,Classic
23427, Where is the Abbot? He knew I might bring word. I've been waiting here for over half an hour. ,Classic
158224," Thank you, Doctor, I'd love to. ",Classic
67174," No, positively not. ",Classic
70808," You have got plenty of time, you know. ",Classic
128584," Really? It's a small universe, isn't it.   I wonder, boy, what would you do if you were me, hmmm? Or perhaps I should ask, what would I do if I were me.",Classic
132203," Oh yes, sir. You are the Doctor? ",Classic
44920, What do you mean? ,Classic
114436, I just don't ,Classic
32717," Put it away, Ben. ",Classic
106383," Negative on immunity, master. ",Classic
33675," Yes, sir. But, this wench   Yes, sir. Very good, sir. ",Classic
88126," The Citadel of Peladon, Sarah. One of the most interesting and ",Classic
143869, Are you all right? ,Classic
67342," Oh, are you leaving, Sir Keith? ",Classic
64786, Clever. ,Classic
124236," Faith, Deons. We can restore the Dodecahedron by offering the angry god an exchange for its return. His life for the great light that illuminates us all. ",Classic
28243, I'm afraid she's gone. ,Classic
58386," I think it's his shoulder. I think it's only a bruise. It's not broken. Lift him up, very gently. What's this?   Yes, that's all right. ",Classic
50902, Command accepted. ,Classic
31301," Look, you're not going to fool the guy that did the real Examiner in! ",Classic
131395, Are you sure this is Earth? ,Classic
39526," No, you mustn't. ",Classic
165132, I wasn't expecting one. ,Classic
25256," Ahh! Still one chair left to try, I see. ",Classic
128454, Yes. ,Classic
98959, Good. Let's go. ,Classic
134535, And what's all this equipment for? ,Classic
30620, He seems to be enjoying all this. ,Classic
143828, We should leave here at once. ,Classic
120015, She's right. ,Classic
117124," Well, I mean ",Classic
69729," ITS, sir, report sightings confirmed. ",Classic
14228, But I thought Richard had red hair. ,Classic
98954," I'll organise anything you require, Doctor. ",Classic
120989," Yes, well, I can't discuss anything until I've spoken to the Company. ",Classic
149529, Laburnum? Why? ,Classic
126772," No more orders, Doctor. Goodbye. ",Classic
141705, Vorshak. ,Classic
112925, Affirmative. ,Classic
61173, The resistance group were all concentrated in this one area. We have them completely encircled. ,Classic
68038," Now just a moment, Doctor. I'm aware for your preference for acting as a one-man band, but this does happen to be a UNIT operation. ",Classic
129556," If you wished. But you have no need, yet. ",Classic
66713, Squad! 'Shun! As you were! 'Shun! Stand at ease! Don't move.,Classic
147337, We're in the right place. ,Classic
25077," What's that?   Four legs, no feet, of arms no lack, it carries no burden on its back. Six deadly sisters, seven for choice, call the servants without voice. What does it mean? ",Classic
133141, Shouldn't we move the Tardis in case the bomb goes off? ,Classic
144642, Here and there. ,Classic
124345," I think we should. Come along, K9. ",Classic
61249, It seems my trust in you was a little misplaced. ,Classic
11775," As soon as the repairs to the capsule are complete, the explosive device will be released into the bowels of this planet. ",Classic
11153," Yeah. Come on, I'll give you a hand. ",Classic
52150, But who's in charge hear? Who's setting all these tests for us? ,Classic
57227, Fuel supplies are at marginal level. There must be no misjudgments. ,Classic
16296," Yes, I had a qualm or two myself. ",Classic
22057, Kenerve. You can't talk to me like that. I am an actor! ,Classic
106739," Faster, faster. ",Classic
126963," With respect, Kassia, we cannot allow superstition to stampede reason. ",Classic
4975, What's happening? ,Classic
38974," Oh, yes, quite sure. Once our young friend has cooled his heels a bit, he'll launch off on his own. And you dropped the hint about the south wing beautifully.",Classic
98947, Money? ,Classic
93360," Yes, yes, well never mind about that. Could you help us to find Sarah? ",Classic
66492," He doesn't get any better tempered, does he? ",Classic
64788," All right, I'll deal with him. And since your own skin's in danger, you can help me.",Classic
18667," I fully appreciate that fact, young man. ",Classic
101560," Very good, Castellan. ",Classic
47943," The director, Miss Megan Jones, is leaving reception on her way here now, sir. ",Classic
54973, The Krotons. They've sent her to join the Krotons. ,Classic
84326, Why? What's so special about this room? ,Classic
23146," Well, I've been, I've been in Egypt. ",Classic
56113," In that case, you are useless. You will all be destroyed. ",Classic
137613," So, there's more than one creature on board. ",Classic
20665," It's a trifle brash, isn't it? There are other space vessels, you know. ",Classic
17250, It was the beginning of the year. ,Classic
2318, But this is level nine. We must be near. ,Classic
147163, Yeah. But seven kilos of plastic at such short notice? ,Classic
34550, Zaroff. ,Classic
15853," Goodbye, Tor. Come along, my child. Come along. ",Classic
84563, Mine. Mucus membrane cells. ,Classic
76766," No. Right, Ky. Take me to Miss Grant. ",Classic
93373," It will be difficult, but it will be done. ",Classic
127903," But that would do fine, don't you agree? ",Classic
37967," First Polly and Ben, now Jamie. We've no time to lose. ",Classic
49761," Shall I seal off the airlocks, Gem? ",Classic
75375, Everything. I sent them a full report as soon as Miss Grant spotted you at the naval base. ,Classic
64971, This launch was against the expressed wishes of Sir James Quinlan. ,Classic
61808, Shoot the tyres! ,Classic
125662, Ah. ,Classic
35683, Ben. ,Classic
20461," I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I am sorry. Okay, but look. If you really are that fond of him you'd better tell him to get out of the city. ",Classic
23108, A dangerous thing to do in days like these. ,Classic
27873, Are you sure? ,Classic
140562," Oh, yes, of course, Grandfather. I'll just go and take another look. ",Classic
8115, John. John? ,Classic
77549," Danger of what, for heavens sake? ",Classic
106618," Oh, that's all right, then. ",Classic
90802," Doctor, there' been another. Where is he? ",Classic
71820, Then you can sit in your ship till you rot. Try to get out and you'll be shot on the spot. ,Classic
114463, Dead things? ,Classic
123647, Why not? I don't like not knowing where we're going to turn up next. ,Classic
4672," No, surely she'd wait for us. ",Classic
67873," Colonel? Colonel, the Autons that were sent to recover the bodies of the Doctor and the girl ",Classic
159041, Whenever you wish. Go in fortune and happiness.   You traitor. I've been planning my revenge for three thousand years. How can you stand in my way now I am so close? ,Classic
115632," I'm so sorry to take your new friend away so soon, Miss, but we have some urgent business to attend to. ",Classic
50596," I will dial for the Capital, Cully, if you don't mind. ",Classic
72753," It's going. I must get back. The next time could be the finish. Sergeant Osgood, can you operate that machine now?",Classic
71226, You've got to stop him. Dent'll shoot them down and be glad of the excuse! ,Classic
139782," I'm not ready for it. I don't think anyone is, especially Eternals. ",Classic
130787,"   Come on.   Now, this person Aris. ",Classic
88178," I believed you. Oh, it is very impressive, Doctor. But what about those guards? I thought you said they were friendly here. ",Classic
92777, If you insist. ,Classic
133801, Like or dislike does not come into my consideration. ,Classic
2366," This is what they call a compensator, my friend. ",Classic
123167," I must respect your new position. Not that I, er, that there was ever ",Classic
8360," Well, I've always been able to read your mind, but only when you allowed me to.  1 ",Classic
163743, We've been worried about you. ,Classic
87771, I am called Bellal. I mean you no harm. I will help you if I can. I do not share the beliefs of those who would have killed you. They consider that I and others like me are their enemies. ,Classic
13576," No, no, no, no. Don't unplug it. You must never do that. You must never break the time and relative dimension link. Come on. ",Classic
108614," I am at full offensive capability, master. ",Classic
70932," Whatever that Doctor's lost, no one seems to have found it. ",Classic
102406, Neeva! Neeva! This is Xoanon.   Where have you heard my voice? ,Classic
31751," Well, if you really want to call a truce. ",Classic
149641," Look at the size of that thing, Doctor. ",Classic
48096, Victoria Waterfield! You tricked me! That's not fair. ,Classic
152524, Thank you. ,Classic
91086, But if I joined? ,Classic
142062," Doctor, try to disconnect the computer first. ",Classic
114702, Will you write everything that happened? ,Classic
70655, We can skin it and you can use it for a rug. ,Classic
11551," Oh, they give us some in return for the clothes. We're hungry most of the time though. ",Classic
165441," I mean, all these other shops are open, aren't they? Where'd you think we'd be if we didn't join in? ",Classic
121519, Yes. It eats people. ,Classic
107235, It looks like a pentagram. It's the way the fragments have been assembled. ,Classic
44104," Careful, you might have been followed. ",Classic
18752," Then we must use bars, as Three did! ",Classic
146646," Continue to provoke me, and the matter that contains your genius will finish up as so much animal fodder. ",Classic
151862, You're wasting your time there. He's not interested in you. ,Classic
132838," Do you know, I think since his regeneration, he's become decidedly immature. ",Classic
110503, I can't. ,Classic
120705, Yes. And with her die the dark ages for this planet. ,Classic
2186," Without radiation, the Dalek race is ended. We need it as you and the Thals need air. ",Classic
96467," Saqqara. Too vague, yet it might be our only chance. ",Classic
40853," Silence. This man accuses you of one crime, but there have been many others. If you are responsible, be sure you will be punished. Take him away. ",Classic
149253, Aye. He thought we'd best be prepared lest the Luddite riots started here. Seems he were right. ,Classic
139245, As diversions. ,Classic
142748, Come on. ,Classic
153648," Round the corner, keep straight, turn right at what used to be Oxford Circus, then ask again. I think.",Classic
103139," That is a single function labour robot, D class. D for dumb. It can't speak. ",Classic
139528, Turlough? ,Classic
69472," Right, stay where you are. I'm on my way. Over and out. No need to worry about the Master any more. This time, we've got him.   Right, Sergeant Benton. You'll be in charge of the prison. You can consider yourself Acting Governor. ",Classic
264, They killed him for it. It is better that we live as we have always done. ,Classic
136923," I think I did, we'll have to see. I just hope we're not too late. ",Classic
153098, You'd kill them? The people Katryca calls underground dwellers? That would be mass murder. ,Classic
89509," Where is everybody, though? ",Classic
162063," Come on, Doctor. Don't be shy. ",Classic
93035, You've had one warning about your insolence. ,Classic
28102," And you'll miss the swaying palms, the white beaches, the blue sea ",Classic
17108," Oh, you wait till we get back to Coal Hill. Hey! ",Classic
3113," A game of chess, Ian? ",Classic
108763, It will be quelled. Business will continue as usual. ,Classic
14059, The blinding dark is close now. ,Classic
128179, The Master? ,Classic
140233, Be silent. ,Classic
92036, Why? ,Classic
100032, What?   Salvatore ambulando. ,Classic
110823," Oh, and Jasko, Rodan, Ablif. ",Classic
30558," Oh, I can just imagine trying to tackle one of them geezers with a screwdriver.   Hey, wait a minute! If I was to turn this on the door, it might blind him! Yeah.   Hah! I saw that film twenty years ago.   Oy, come in here mate, you're wanted! Oy, come in here!   Now then, Fred! ",Classic
164403," Go on, then. Evolve your way out of that one. ",Classic
80878," Right, it's all clear. Come on. ",Classic
10174," All right, we'll move the body. As far as you're concerned, Farrow left here to go to his boat. I'll put his briefcase in the lab first. ",Classic
96976, You'll be all right. ,Classic
126340, Are you sure she's a time sensitive? ,Classic
75335," Just a minute. Under lock and key, eh? ",Classic
107010, Don't know what you mean. Ain't nothing like that around here. ,Classic
75944," As you know, our friends here have underground and underwater bases all over the world. Well, I propose to reactivate them. ",Classic
52678," Sausages. Man will just become like a string of sausages, all the same. ",Classic
5603, No. I'm certain he doesn't know. I'll get it later then come for you. Be ready. ,Classic
136973, Yes. The Mara has been destroyed.  ,Classic
74315, Such things have been known on primitive planets. ,Classic
44032," No, no, no, no. Jetty, jetty. Er, anything else to tell us?",Classic
75218, Doctor! ,Classic
119059, Would you please prepare for the Professor half a dozen escargot au beurre followed by an entrecote bordelaise with haricots vert and pommes sautees served directly here to the laboratory. ,Classic
81337," Well, by a rather brilliant last minute course correction, I've managed to materialise the Tardis inside the spaceship. But to avoid hitting it, I've had to make a random jump back into normal space. ",Classic
76371," Come on, let's get to that conference. ",Classic
96420," No, it isn't. It's the entrance to a time-space tunnel. ",Classic
78077, You are lying! No one rules Kronos! ,Classic
7086, But the other times were different. The Sensorites made our decisions for us. ,Classic
8484," Come back here, you men. Treachery. ",Classic
72631, With the new mark 4A condenser unit?,Classic
107424, Is there anything I can do? ,Classic
2043," Well, let me have the torch then. Unless you think you ",Classic
110072," Put her out, Commander. ",Classic
31290," I shall look forward to your report. Bragen, see that the Examiner and his party get some proper clothes, will you? ",Classic
111641, About what? ,Classic
39362, Alpha. ,Classic
83835," But, Doctor, don't you understand? I've got to go! This Professor Jones, he's fighting for everything that's important, everything that you've fought for. In a funny way, he reminds me of a sort of younger you. ",Classic
58194," Yeah, it is a bittie. That's your thermonuclear power, you see. Yeah, it's wearing out a bit. Nothing you can do about that. ",Classic
82980, Good. We must move. It's not fit to stay here. ,Classic
7518," Ah ha! I thought so. Yes, yes, yes, some kind of bargaining ahead of us. ",Classic
53417," Aye, aye. ",Classic
100800," Quick, get down! ",Classic
6741, Hold him! This belongs to you? ,Classic
81894," Look, don't you realise that you're one of us? We're all prisoners here! Victims of the system! ",Classic
5797," About where you are, Susan. ",Classic
42398," Oh, aye, so it is, so it is. You don't see yourself dressed like that then? ",Classic
46868, It is them. Come on. Am I glad to see you! There's fungus at Warren Street. ,Classic
123966," Will you swear allegiance to Ti, Doctor? ",Classic
38337," Oh, no. I don't think we'd better do that. Jamie, I think we'd better talk to the police. ",Classic
38564, Who are you? Who are you? Answer!   ,Classic
159606," What are you doing here? Oh, never mind. Get this thing out of here. ",Classic
104391, The spell of the shaman. ,Classic
96105," It's too late for any more mistakes, Salamar. I'm taking command. ",Classic
76094, It's the Master. He collapsed soon after they picked us up. ,Classic
102229," Attack!   Come on, attack! ",Classic
45979, Evans didn't mention any other survivors. ,Classic
153635, Is this the way to the surface? ,Classic
105851," Reuben! You all right now? You shouldn't have come up here. I'll hang on till morning. You go and get some sleep.   No, no. ",Classic
51568, Report progress. ,Classic
126981," We can't afford to stand on ceremony, Consul Seron. I propose we put it to the vote. ",Classic
97970, You. ,Classic
122230, The Skonnon battlefleet is an awesome sight. ,Classic
88738, Someone coming. Over there.   They must be mad. My miners won't work with guards standing over them. ,Classic
161259," Yes, with just one purpose. Destruction. ",Classic
36418," Oh no, you stay up here, Doctor. I wouldn't know what to do. ",Classic
108889, The door's locked. Nobody's been in here for years. ,Classic
59147," You'd better pull back, Ian. ",Classic
85276, But the forest is still in darkness! Who knows what demons may set upon us? ,Classic
146313," But you're not. You're safe. The point is, can you save him? ",Classic
85324," Space hardware. New alloys, guidance systems, methods of propulsion. ",Classic
7081, Barbara! Susan! ,Classic
53496,   Switch over to the emergency circuits. I want that lift operational in three minutes!   I want all lift exits covered. I want a man on each floor. Move! ,Classic
41067, Jamie! Victoria! Keep back! ,Classic
156385," Oh yes, indeed I have.",Classic
118109, Yes. ,Classic
74728, He will not escape capture for long. ,Classic
138350, I'm needed here. ,Classic
103639, Please do not throw hands at me. She will recover. ,Classic
41988," Yes, but the control units, they were made somehow, somewhere? ",Classic
164008, Just call me ratkin. ,Classic
47730," Ja, and we've not heard from him since. And what about Rig C? ",Classic
18487, You keep saying we. How many of you are there? ,Classic
4779, No it isn't. It isn't. And this terrible dress. And the furniture. ,Classic
10581," Oh, yes, it's going to explode and when it does it'll go off just like, well, to us a thousand pound bomb. ",Classic
89655, Absolutely beautiful. ,Classic
101568, Is that so. ,Classic
2132," No, just a minute. Now, you go and tell your friends to stop flashing the light on the antennae. Because for all we know, the Daleks might have a beam to throw on them, paralyse them, kill them. ",Classic
164053, Hello? ,Classic
152772," Oh, pity it couldn't be a dry one. ",Classic
72620," Ah. Well, is it all right if I get on with a bit of clearing up? ",Classic
60388, That's impossible! ,Classic
6548," For his last few days of life, all that he desires is granted to him. ",Classic
164972," I was just thinking. If these vampires, I mean haemovores, if they come here. Well, Kathleen and her little baby. ",Classic
6526, Tell me about her. ,Classic
105795," What? No, Miss Nethercott is an astrologer. The finest. I consult her every month. ",Classic
139364, It would be ridiculous to risk losing the race for an Ephemeral. ,Classic
221, Your civilisation? ,Classic
142136," If we're trespassing, I apologise. ",Classic
6276, Do you question the value of such sacrifice? ,Classic
5785," I gave him a key. Sabetha, you remember that fake key? Barbara found it on the idol. ",Classic
70902," The hostile animals, if they exist, can be found and destroyed, sir. ",Classic
158613," Until Kane needs your services, yes. What's the matter, getting cold feet?   Kill him!   Leave him. He's in the restricted zone. He's a dead man. ",Classic
131499, No one at home. ,Classic
37989, The man in charge of this whole mission. ,Classic
113097, We will mine it. Prepare to jump as soon as the voolium and madranite one five crystals have been produced. ,Classic
3370, Marco's worried about bandits. ,Classic
55657," Oh don't be ridiculous, Beta. We're not leaving you here. Besides, I feel quite faint. I don't think I could walk a step.",Classic
51120, All specimens have reached point of collapse. ,Classic
101327," No, no, wait, sir. Please, if I could ask you a few questions. ",Classic
116866," That's enough, K9, that's enough. Back up. ",Classic
34791," And another and another and another. It's no use, I won't, Jamie. ",Classic
121757," Perhaps it's because, as you say, he is a criminal. ",Classic
45293, We'll see about that. We'll see about that. ,Classic
92459, I bet that singed their whiskers for them. ,Classic
150737, Walk? Of course I can walk. ,Classic
66204, You are talking of the Republican Security Forces. And the reason we are here is that this is a scientific labour camp. ,Classic
142804, Keep good watch. ,Classic
10758, Tyler? ,Classic
162863, You were bound. My mother sealed you into the ice caves for all eternity. ,Classic
7351, The other Earth people will not be able to help you. ,Classic
119062," Yes, sir. ",Classic
38527," Oh, dear. ",Classic
59350," I was asleep, Captain Ransom. You did not wish to disturb me. ",Classic
5418, He was your friend? ,Classic
149577, She'll have a seizure. I've seen it happen before. ,Classic
140248," You would do well, my dear Doctor, to ponder that you played directly into my hand. ",Classic
100708, But that's incredible. ,Classic
142939, Why didn't you dig deep bunkers? The Arardjacks of Heiradi hollowed out a huge subterranean city under their planet during the Twenty Aeon War. ,Classic
115079," I see. But since you've already got a princess, what do you need me for? ",Classic
121106, Could you take me to the power unit yourself? ,Classic
14084," Either it hasn't heard, or it doesn't trust us. ",Classic
154604, It's Verne!   No! ,Classic
44370, It must be wonderful travelling all over the world with him. ,Classic
45977, The driver. ,Classic
31885," Exactly, Ben. Exactly! Only two people knew of his arrival on this planet. Myself and his murderer. ",Classic
164892," Ah, good. Oh, I need to have a word with your two young friends. ",Classic
101227, Don't forget me. ,Classic
21800," All right Doctor, I promise that I won't experiment with it any further. ",Classic
57692, There must be a cruiser in the area. ,Classic
61579," We have accepted your plea that there is evil in the universe that must be fought, and that you still have a part to play in that battle. ",Classic
33897," Go, girl. ",Classic
145458, Why are you keeping us here? ,Classic
118489, Units four and six. Investigation of section seven commencing. ,Classic
70441," Sorry, Jo. Ah, Brigadier, just in time to say goodbye! ",Classic
61898, Good. Two energy units are still missing. ,Classic
163216," Brigadier, tell Bambera she's in trouble. ",Classic
41725, Put to the test I ran and hid like a mountain rabbit. I'm not fit to be called a warrior. We must lead out our brothers before more of them are destroyed. ,Classic
54331," Oh, what about the Brigadier, and the rest of the men? ",Classic
134342, Nyssa? Nyssa! Can you hear me? ,Classic
146743," Look, everything has been considered. How many times must I tell you. ",Classic
69312, To save lives. Several people have died already. ,Classic
33575, Creag an tuire! ,Classic
148390, The Tardis should be ,Classic
158724, Where? ,Classic
38733, What experiment? ,Classic
153769," We'll have to blast through them, Dibber. ",Classic
125580," Camilla, Aukon and Zargo. Wait a minute. Sharkey, Zharkey, Zarkey, Zar, Zargo. The same name passed down through generations. ",Classic
36946, Hit by one of the beasties? ,Classic
144443, Goodbye? What are you talking about? ,Classic
78218," Delaying tactics, Brigadier. A small fly in the Master's metaphorical ointment.",Classic
92295, You've got the power on. ,Classic
106347," Accident? What sort of accident? Well, let's have a look at you. ",Classic
141204," Certainly. Goodbye, Doctor. ",Classic
6905, Dead. ,Classic
122348," Look, I just have to do what I can. Please, don't tell Teka. ",Classic
161798," No, creepy. ",Classic
32795," Don't pretend you can't recognise English Redcoats when you see them, even at this distance. ",Classic
45363, Nothing but stars. What does it mean? ,Classic
157381, I don't believe it. It's not possible. It can't be. It could be.,Classic
62075," And where do you live, Mister Seeley? ",Classic
40416," Yes, we will listen, but first you will be altered. ",Classic
115567," Here we are, K9. Here we are. This must be it. ",Classic
104450, ,Classic
135126," Well, something's causing it. We must change course. ",Classic
148963, You ought to learn to avoid situations where ,Classic
73193," Look, Jo, don't worry about it. It was a freak affect. It's very unlikely to happen again. Hold that and give me those papers. ",Classic
138947, Win what? ,Classic
126709, Without you? ,Classic
39009," I'm off to hunt a few ghosties, Mollie.",Classic
37766, Not too good. ,Classic
22867," Yes, all right. ",Classic
153216, How dare you! ,Classic
128437, Traken should be ,Classic
116668," The fleet is still trying to locate the target, sir.  MARSHALThe target, Major Shapp, is Zeos! The planet. Isn't that big enough?   The navigation systems are being blocked, sir. The Zeons must be using a new device. The whole fleet's flying blind. ",Classic
151034, Did I do wrong? ,Classic
19611," We'll manage, especially if the Refusians help us. ",Classic
132111, Try and think what the Doctor would do if he were here. ,Classic
112951," Yes, like a huge fist. It's one huge mining machine that mines planets, extracts all the valuable minerals and leaves the rubble behind. ",Classic
70346," Well, he'll have to take out the trigger mechanism before he can disconnect the final cable. ",Classic
128522, These are secure premises! Now you lot have got some explaining to do. ,Classic
50443, Come here. Explain. ,Classic
52258," Which way, do you think? ",Classic
15290," Well, that's all very well but how do we know they're friendly? They might shoot us on sight. ",Classic
110465," One grows tired of almost everything, Castellan. ",Classic
67477," Well, that's where you'll find me then. No, Miss Grant. You stay here with the Brigadier.",Classic
160719, The mark three. ,Classic
98469, Eh? ,Classic
53714, I understand. ,Classic
144071, The Time Corridor is on the other side of the airlock. ,Classic
92028," You fool, Libri.   ",Classic
45370, Flight. ,Classic
151207," Android. Quick, away from here. ",Classic
82329, Look out! We must take the girl!  ,Classic
102791," Yes, it is horrible. Isn't it horrible? ",Classic
116273," Six? From the end of its tentacles, that makes it, it must be nearly a mile across! ",Classic
28847," Shh, watch him. I'm sure there's something strange about that police box. Look, he's got a key for it. He's going inside! ",Classic
73375, You're sure? ,Classic
36349, That's not necessary. ,Classic
54718," But you never know, they could take time to get that bomb of theirs ready, and that Russian rocket might make it. ",Classic
17362, Thanks. Thank you. ,Classic
47851, Is this right? ,Classic
117234," Yes, but you need Zeons to experiment on. ",Classic
12938, But I would have sworn ,Classic
129874, I'm not thinking of myself. We've got to get to Earth and warn them! ,Classic
25243, Henry! ,Classic
18357," I can't move it. It's immovable! Wait, wait, wait. I have an idea. I might be able to sabotage them. Be patient. We know what this machine's for. This is to convert air into ammonia gas. ",Classic
47767, We've apparently frightened it away. ,Classic
63607, That is precisely what we must not do. ,Classic
69261," The Ma, er, er, Keller or whatever he calls himself. ",Classic
130869," Quickly, child. Help me. He must not interfere. You, Not-we woman, stay where you are, with the idiot. ",Classic
88217, Ambassador? ,Classic
90934, He must be sure that everything is safe. ,Classic
129032, But once you get outside the walls ,Classic
134006," What do you mean, because this is a police box? ",Classic
132688, Did George kill Digby? ,Classic
156874, Just make certain she understands the penalty for non-cooperation. ,Classic
107417, What?   Of course. That's why there's no record of the planet. ,Classic
73725," If those criminals saw you here, they might think that you had betrayed them, and in any case they would try and harm you. ",Classic
55060, Who are you? What do you want? Leave me alone! ,Classic
161989, Don't you hear it? ,Classic
152567," Look out, more Daleks. ",Classic
75282," Yes, on there. ",Classic
16313, Tracking device locked. ,Classic
24186," Nero, the Trojan wars, the Daleks. But all that happened in the first segment of time. ",Classic
152508," Now look, I've got a radio transmitter here. You can use that. ",Classic
114965," One of our local wines. Modest, demure, but palatable. Join us, Farrah. ",Classic
9644, Stirling? You? ,Classic
163656, Why not? It's my initiative test. ,Classic
156359," When the Matrix is restored, you can do what you like with the Master, but exercise leniency with Sabalom Glitz. He's not beyond redemption. ",Classic
100749, Professor Watson? ,Classic
16733, No. The patrol will continue. ,Classic
38627," Well, is there another way through? This door is locked. ",Classic
23911," No, Marshall. ",Classic
11402," Jenny, what's that noise? ",Classic
1656, But supposing ,Classic
23543," Oh, it's only you. What's the time? ",Classic
35643, But that's wonderful! ,Classic
154758, Where are we going? ,Classic
62357, It's nearly half past five. Can't we take a break? I can hardly keep me eyes open. ,Classic
118477, Security sensors detect unauthorised movement in section seven. ,Classic
47140, What have they done? Can't move. ,Classic
65756," Oh, did you get those figures from the computer? ",Classic
99535," And where's your precious Beresford? I suppose he's dropped everything and run, has he? ",Classic
80853, I wonder? ,Classic
157723, Are we going up or are we going down? ,Classic
66516," Zero minus three minutes, zero seconds. Condition Red Two now commencing.",Classic
120794, Organon? Take this and guard it with your life. I don't want to take it anywhere near Erato until I want to give it to him. All right? ,Classic
154893," I doubt that there will ever be sufficient time for that, my lady. ",Classic
30892, I don't know! ,Classic
87845, You will obey! You will obey! You will obey! You will obey! You will obey! ,Classic
95908, No!   ,Classic
19186," He's conscious, Doctor, but only just. Are you going to try it now? ",Classic
134313, We can't just leave her! ,Classic
36129," You're going to be in trouble, and it's my fault. ",Classic
69465," I'm at mobile HQ, sir. ",Classic
66727, It is the Director! We've got to do what he says and let him out of there. ,Classic
158403, Was the Chimeron queen amongst them? ,Classic
99247, What can I say? ,Classic
14246, I'm grateful for that. ,Classic
92772, That is my function. I am a warrior. ,Classic
84806, My designers also found it amusing. I find it suitable. ,Classic
148357, Come on. We must try. ,Classic
134362, You say that as if you expect a round of applause. ,Classic
68655," No, no, no, Doctor. He's Chinese. Now, come along.",Classic
157727, So we could be stuck in here going up and down for hours. ,Classic
146589, You think so? ,Classic
27082, Come on!,Classic
68705," That's enough of that, Mailer. ",Classic
70798, IMC. Interplanetary Mining Corporation. We're doing a mineral survey. ,Classic
53221," Yes, the little dark one was wearing that. They friends of yours? ",Classic
57376," No, Grand Marshall. ",Classic
78043," Ah, Benton. ",Classic
145012," If it's still intact, I think I can operate the main transmitter on my father's ship. That gives us direct access to Trion Communications Executive, and the Custodians will send a rescue ship. ",Classic
14920, You can always trust Ibrahim. ,Classic
142540, He's still mortal. ,Classic
40128, Toberman? ,Classic
37232, I have failed then? ,Classic
77259," I am warning you, Doctor. ",Classic
82522," Yes, they are coming! Which means that I can dispense with your doubtful assistance! Out of my way!",Classic
29383, What? Where are you? ,Classic
37121, I'm the Commandant. ,Classic
58985," It's all right Jamie, I'm perfectly all right. ",Classic
111066, No one may enter or leave this solid-state capsule? ,Classic
17411, Not at all. ,Classic
6477," They are the same, Barbara. That's the whole point. You keep on insisting that Tlotoxl's the odd man out, but he isn't. ",Classic
156883, Do I gather you're suggesting that I climb into one of those cabinets? ,Classic
29677," It's true. And what's more, Mister Blake knows that Ben and I are innocent and it's you and Squire that are ",Classic
153121," No. Only you are the chosen one, Sabalom Glitz. ",Classic
32947," Great! Now, my gallant officer. ",Classic
34330," What, you mean you haven't told your own people what's in store for them? Are you afraid, Zaroff? ",Classic
114879," Well, we can't have her running around the kingdom. Disassemble her. We can cannibalise her for parts. ",Classic
60434, Have you started the reprocessing yet? ,Classic
78323, I don't know. Some sort of explosion. ,Classic
476, All right. ,Classic
44337, Just a moment! ,Classic
84887, I saw it all on one of the monitors downstairs in the director's office. ,Classic
16503," No, I don't think so. Judging by the architecture, I should say Central Europe. ",Classic
122554," Teka, come on! ",Classic
53865, I think I should   ,Classic
56782, Right! ,Classic
14379, You could turn this into a good story against Saladin. ,Classic
63224," Well, I wish I knew. There's only one way of finding out, that's to get in there and see. ",Classic
109187," Escape through there, through the sky to the stars! ",Classic
17631, I see. ,Classic
49328," You know, I'm surprised you didn't know the answer. Now don't tell me there's something you can't work out. ",Classic
158268, Sure. The hills around here are beautiful. We can go somewhere really special. ,Classic
47517," And I warned you, but you are too koppig, too stubborn to listen. Look at the facts, man. The fact that we lose contact with two rigs, have unprecedented, inexplicable pressure variations for over three weeks. ",Classic
30506," Locked! Oh, now where've they put me?   Oh great. A projection room!",Classic
135716, There's no mistake. ,Classic
75605," The Master stole those parts to make his calling device, and ",Classic
101628, Child's play to the Master. Do you think this stuff is sophisticated? There are worlds out there where this kind of equipment would be considered prehistoric junk. ,Classic
4155," Oh, you haven't given him enough time yet. ",Classic
70199, Pure mathematics cannot lie. You'll need an immense amount of power to create a time field for anything as large as Axos.     There you are. There are your final power requirements. ,Classic
162457, Knock its cap off! ,Classic
144967, I don't know. ,Classic
65908, Something.,Classic
22381, Exterminate the creatures. Pursue and exterminate. ,Classic
50213, I'm going to show Zoe the sort of thing that she may be in for.,Classic
7865, Enemies. ,Classic
38679," They've taken my daughter, Victoria. ",Classic
59691," Just a minute, Carstairs. ",Classic
164539," We're not going to be long, are we, Professor? Only I've arranged to meet Phyllis and Jean later. ",Classic
150935,   I think I prefer death.) ,Classic
29512, Then perhaps we should fall in with this young rogue's pot o' purpose. ,Classic
56058," Just a minute, just a minute. Oh this control is. There we are. Now that, that's an ion-jet rocket of the twenty first century, but, this helmet, if I can. There we are. That's not nearly so sophisticated. It's certainly not later than 1960. ",Classic
121388, You mean you've been right through to the other side? ,Classic
4730, It will? You mean he can have it? ,Classic
98350," No, I'm not. ",Classic
146547, What is it? ,Classic
60780," I don't know, But we'll do as he says and stick it out here for as long as we can. ",Classic
127401," Oh, where could they be? ",Classic
69262, Simple. I'm helping him because he's helping me. ,Classic
125893, Maybe he's still under hypnosis? ,Classic
75670," Well, they're definitely getting an echo and the object's moving. ",Classic
119642, You couldn't possibly ,Classic
121202, What about it? ,Classic
99083, We've got to warn Sir Colin. ,Classic
68885, Move. ,Classic
11276," I said, it's a very good idea. ",Classic
86189, I got here first. Turn round. Hands against that wall. ,Classic
45850," Driver on the ammo truck to Holborn. Got jumped, we did. Quite a dust up, there was. Couldn't get past them hairy creatures, see? Been wandering for hours. Lost, I was. I tried one way, but there seemed to be some sort of cobweb muck moving down the tunnel. ",Classic
154000, Murderers. ,Classic
136468," Exactly. The Mara needs the Great Crystal in order to make itself reoccur. Er, stay here. ",Classic
23480, Good. ,Classic
117077," The new architect of our victory. Shapp, order the counterattack. ",Classic
146061," Because Mother happened to give birth to us, does that automatically grant her a place in our affections? ",Classic
153256, I think we should reserve judgement until the end of the sequence. ,Classic
94618," Er, before you do anything rash, like pressing another button, may I make an alternative suggestion? ",Classic
3533, Barbara! Barbara! Barbara!   They moved! The eyes moved! ,Classic
25135, Why didn't you tell me? ,Classic
20203," Rescued? You'll be lucky! Look, may I point out that in the one day that the Doctor now has left, you have to think of a way of saving the city and defeating the Greeks. ",Classic
2654," Don't you see I wouldn't allow them to hurt you, child? They're very resourceful and cunning, and it only leaves me one recourse. They must be put off the ship. ",Classic
87541, Now maybe you'll tell us about yourself. Where were you heading when I jumped you? ,Classic
158316," Really? Couldn't we take it for a bit of a spin, Doctor? ",Classic
8074," Yes, sir. It was the man called the Doctor. ",Classic
32065, We want something better than words. ,Classic
23620," Oh, my dear Admiral, we are pleased with you. Since now our mother will not speak to us for the rest of today, you will come with us. I have a new racquet I want you to see. Come.",Classic
33424, You're fantastic. ,Classic
138311, You realise that Nyssa and Olvir could have found the Tardis by now. ,Classic
91619," Get down, Harry? ",Classic
98318, Was he really that dangerous? ,Classic
44417, It's none of my concern. ,Classic
113855," No, no, no, no. You can catch all sorts of things off a dirty knife, you know. Lockjaw, tetanus, not to mentions staphylococcal infections ",Classic
48437, But it hasn't got a driver. ,Classic
53797, That would be nice. Hey are you stinking rich? ,Classic
1140, It is still enough to destroy. Our prisoners are showing preliminary stages of sickness already. ,Classic
69271," Right, come on.",Classic
78478, Now will you let me turn off the transmitter? ,Classic
91913," I think we'd better find out, don't you? ",Classic
43938, Oh that's very clever of you. How can you do that? I thought you said you had no official position.,Classic
88906," Until I have decided your final fate, you will remain in the communications room.",Classic
15755, Dako and myself are going to try and see if we can find Tor. Are you coming? ,Classic
103632," Come on, we've got to get back to the Command deck. ",Classic
93539," Now look, a number of the scientist believe as we do. When we have enough strength on our side, we'll then give to Davros an ultimatum. ",Classic
57580, Keep full contact with that pirate ship. ,Classic
126712," It is long past time, but how do you think you're going to find the cable? ",Classic
88265, Have you tried to negotiate? ,Classic
88328," Very well. We will trust you, Doctor, for the present. Captain. ",Classic
10276, Making? ,Classic
49787, The X-ray laser machine is repaired. ,Classic
83880, Oh. ,Classic
59539, Mist! ,Classic
119167," Yes, Hermann. Where's the Count? ",Classic
142076," Look out, Commander. ",Classic
87358," Good grief. It's a triceratops. Look, Brigadier, try and keep it occupied while I'm finishing this off, will you? Don't worry, they're none too bright. ",Classic
77337," Can you prove your assertion, Doctor? Perhaps we could see these tablets you mention. ",Classic
124204, Ow! Don't keep doing that. I know I landed very close to here! ,Classic
152315, ADalek patrol has recently been attacked. ,Classic
47704," You wanted this, didn't you? It's just what you wanted! ",Classic
84944, Serendipity? ,Classic
99418, This bit. ,Classic
24311, But that's utter nonsense. I mean how can you possibly ,Classic
21848, That then. ,Classic
9550, Killed him? ,Classic
153835," And, oh, the secrets. Of course, you must bring them. I mean, they'll expect you to bring them. ",Classic
141419," Er, yes, yes, the bridge. Repairs to the Tardis will take some time. Better they're done with the Captain's permission. ",Classic
43997," No, Salamander, they are not amateurs. They are very clever men dedicated to their work, but they are men, capable of human error like anybody else. ",Classic
9896, I've burnt myself. It's hot! ,Classic
12632," No, I'm afraid not, you see, I should have to buy you. Now please, let me explain. ",Classic
66963," I hope so. Now fix the connector to the cable, will you? ",Classic
153148, We've not met an organic since we passed the selection. ,Classic
89181," Oh, I can try, Doctor, but many of them have been killed. They think Aggedor's turned against them. ",Classic
31859, We will conquer. We will conquer. We will conquer. ,Classic
40923, You are asking us to condemn a man to certain death. ,Classic
114826, Hmm? ,Classic
981, How's your headache now? ,Classic
44541, Just closing up the gaps. ,Classic
104596," He was ill for many months. I was but a humble peasant, but I gave him sanctuary while the soldiers searched. I nursed him. ",Classic
31780, I thought Quinn was the danger. ,Classic
75952," Captain Hart, what about this? ",Classic
149199," You are indeed a worthy opponent. It's what gives your destruction its piquancy.   Excellent! Feast your eyes, Doctor, on the imminent demise of the Tardis. ",Classic
21697, We're still on our own course. The Daleks haven't attempted to divert us yet. ,Classic
104563, No? You mean nobody? ,Classic
144440," Howard, I've got to go and find out what's happened to the transport. ",Classic
11872," But I love you, Susan, and I want you to marry me. ",Classic
108386," Fight, yes. ",Classic
500, No! No! ,Classic
32498," Doctor, it's stupid to hide in here! ",Classic
77323, And to declare this preliminary hearing closed. ,Classic
134706, Captain! ,Classic
86042," I cannot reveal my face, Irongron. ",Classic
15843," Ah, that my boy, yes. Well that I got from the Space Museum. This young man here, Tor, very kindly gave it to me as a souvenir. ",Classic
44520, What sort of blackmail? What had you done? ,Classic
140387," Come along, Doctor. ",Classic
116716, Still nothing from the fleet? ,Classic
95042," Yes, some kind of nerve gas. Affects the higher consciousness. ",Classic
57605," Ian, we shall have to rethink our tactics. We shall never catch them by normal patrol methods. ",Classic
134382, Your spirits are very well-informed. ,Classic
39792, We're not going to leave her. She's coming with us. The end. The final end. ,Classic
141400, Around 2084. ,Classic
127392," Tremas, we must stop Kassia becoming the Keeper, and for that we need the master plans. ",Classic
46612, Jamie. ,Classic
112358," I do dislike faint praise. It was astoundingly clever, wasn't it Garron? ",Classic
8914," Citizen, I seek no reward. ",Classic
46060," This mist, does it do anything? I mean, is it poisonous or anything? ",Classic
9289," I'm not sure I like the idea of being used by the English. You shouldn't either, Jules. We're at war! And they're our enemies, and here we are helping their spies. ",Classic
159, We can't force him. ,Classic
77083, Miss Grant had nothing to do with it! ,Classic
160717, Here we are. Look at that. ,Classic
70763," Robert, wait! ",Classic
144834, What happened? ,Classic
76664," He did, sir. ",Classic
126588, That way. ,Classic
40498, What are you going to do now? ,Classic
20042," Ah! Ah, let me see. Last week, my friend Diomede died from his wounds in this camp. Now, you're about his size. You'll find his thing in the next tent. ",Classic
13954, Is there is power in the magnetic pole of the planet? That is where the web has its centre. ,Classic
147104," You may not believe this, but I have fully stabilised. ",Classic
113579," Come, o great one, come. Your time is near. ",Classic
148923, There's a good boy. Good. Good Fido now. ,Classic
116887," Surgeon Merak, sir. ",Classic
5852,"   Now where is this door, Susan? ",Classic
78408, You talk as if she was alive. ,Classic
110975, Well? ,Classic
86500, And what good will that do? ,Classic
39349, They are. ,Classic
147110," And I would suggest, Peri, that you wait a little before criticising my new persona. You may well find it isn't quite as disagreeable as you think. ",Classic
126743, Psst.   I can't stand a lot of that. ,Classic
57713, Those three that lead us into your ambush. ,Classic
12495," We can explain, if you put up your swords. ",Classic
23794, Positive. Just look at them. They all believe the Huguenots killed him. ,Classic
86382, What's the name of the King? ,Classic
85368, She had an invitation to visit here. I took her place. ,Classic
148103, No. ,Classic
63861," Yes, sir, he's here. Hold the line. The Ministry of Defence. ",Classic
124605, I've got to warn them. ,Classic
64606, Their life support systems will be running down. We've got to send up another recovery capsule. ,Classic
51124, Zoe's out there. ,Classic
48323, But she was standing right beside us. ,Classic
32178," She's against the Daleks. Afraid, are you? Nothing's going to happen to you if you behave. ",Classic
110535," Good for you, young Andred. Good for you. Now, can I stay and help? ",Classic
71662, What are you going to do? ,Classic
120119, He's dead. ,Classic
151116," Indeed you are. This is Peri, my assistant. ",Classic
116936," Oh, it's you. ",Classic
27221, Stay here. A guard will collect you. ,Classic
6035," Yes, they've made him a warrior, and he's promised me not to interfere with the sacrifice. ",Classic
114411, Who are you? Identify yourself to the court. ,Classic
52831, Don't argue! Follow us. ,Classic
131255,"   Thank you, sir. ",Classic
162997," A dark, mysterious one? ",Classic
147261, Move. ,Classic
125700, I am Aukon. Welcome to my domain.   ,Classic
155376, There's no danger. The safety margin is more than adequate. ,Classic
112606, Oolian? ,Classic
82573, Can you? ,Classic
152316, Outrageous. ,Classic
3499," You mustn't go there alone, Grandfather. And anyway, we must stay with you. ",Classic
19978, I don't quite follow. ,Classic
137686, It is the Time Lords' curse. ,Classic
110726, We must wait for the Doctor. ,Classic
95022, Sir. ,Classic
53004," Oh, don't tell me you can read as well. What else do you do!? ",Classic
747, Everyone cannot be leader. ,Classic
143142," Well, he must have suspected something if he was down this far. ",Classic
132415, Lady Cranleigh. ,Classic
143671, Hardly alien. ,Classic
103140, Has anyone told him that? ,Classic
55707," Yes Doctor, I'm afraid we have failed. The machine is unharmed.",Classic
75912," Did you give any thought at all, sir, as to what you were doing? ",Classic
105666," Try and find some way to secure that door, hmm? ",Classic
161700, When? ,Classic
31532," Yes. Now, I cannot think what this short stubby arm is for. ",Classic
61840," Very good, sir. ",Classic
119401," Well, I'll want to question him, so we can both have a little chat, can't we. ",Classic
76372," Here, you take that.",Classic
13813, Look!   They're still following us. ,Classic
154780," Be still, old one, unless you wish your wizened life terminated. ",Classic
2160," Ah, well, I'll go ",Classic
16338," Yes, well, please, just leave it to me, dear boy, just leave it to me, will you? ",Classic
138717, Have you given any thought as to how we're going to get home? ,Classic
91333," I know, but we have to try. ",Classic
14198, Not the King? ,Classic
131099, It's very good. What's that? ,Classic
105624," Doctor? Where are you?   Hello? Doctor, are you there? Doctor?   Reuben? Is something wrong? Reuben? ",Classic
140258," Yes, but for how much longer? ",Classic
71570," Well, you seem to have lost this one, Dent. ",Classic
78400," Glad to have you aboard, Miss Grant. ",Classic
155264, Can I help? ,Classic
137337," Yes, well, just at the moment I'd settle for half a Tardis, and I'm very worried about Nyssa and Tegan. ",Classic
94201, I don't know what you mean. ,Classic
31802, It should have quite a good range. ,Classic
30573, Why should we mind? ,Classic
97894, Take him. The flame must feed. ,Classic
27607," Hold him, Dodo. Hang on to him. This might just work. ",Classic
3355," There were bandits here last night when I arrived, so I had to wait in hiding until this morning when they left. And then when I prepared to leave for you, I saw your caravan coming across the desert towards me. ",Classic
11896, It must have done. It's just got here early that's all. It is here. It's as plain as anything on the screen. ,Classic
154841, This time you will be successful. ,Classic
43904," McCrimmon, you said? ",Classic
39954, If you like. ,Classic
24658, I think I can hear them coming back. ,Classic
159180," The creature, it's dead! They've killed it. ",Classic
94961, The man on the beach. The man who was shot. ,Classic
81426, Empires? You mean like Solos? ,Classic
118265, I don't know. A feeling I've been here before. ,Classic
128451, If you call this alien gibberish a programme. ,Classic
40170, I'll stay with you. ,Classic
156969, Let me out! Let me out! Do you hear me?,Classic
30567, Come to Mondas and you will have no need of emotions. You will become like us. ,Classic
85077," Hello, Doctor. Hello, Doctor. It's working.   Doctor, it's working. I say again, it's working. They're dying like, well, like maggots.",Classic
138971, Looks like you're wanted. ,Classic
145874, Because I'll kill you if you don't. ,Classic
116009, Have you ever seen anything like this before? ,Classic
98089, Be ready. Warn the guards. ,Classic
161975, The show is about to start. ,Classic
91516, Not very. ,Classic
71990," Well, you know the local chat. Death and disaster if he opens the barrow. ",Classic
79368," Steady now, Sergeant. He knows what he's doing. At least I hope he does. ",Classic
55253," Well all life doesn't necessarily have feeling, you know.   Great jumping gobstoppers! What's that? ",Classic
142288," Just obeying orders, Colonel. ",Classic
49980," Zoe, look! ",Classic
72556," Quite a bit, but I don't think you'd believe me, even if I told you. ",Classic
26180," Yeah, I guessed that was you. That's why I come a lookin'. You shoulda killed the little rat. ",Classic
49647, And he ignored them. ,Classic
113546," But Doctor, haven't you forgotten something? ",Classic
71876," Doctor, why don't you come in with me? We're both Time Lords, we're both renegades. We could be masters of the galaxy! Think of it, Doctor, absolute power! Power for good. Why, you could reign benevolently, you could end wars, suffering, disease. We could save the universe. ",Classic
87031," Yes, well now that you've caught me, General, you can end the evacuation and return your eight million Londoners, can't you. ",Classic
55967," Moscow ready now, Miss Kelly. ",Classic
75764," Well, this is war, my dear, and war calls for sacrifice. Any chance of any more toast, my dear? ",Classic
15540, All this time? We'd be fooling ourselves to believe otherwise. ,Classic
80218,"   No, there's only one explanation. ",Classic
55535," What? Oh, of course. The worst smell in the world. ",Classic
76186," Taking their time, aren't they, Jo? Jo? Jo, where? Oh, they you are. ",Classic
87427," Well, it's not my fault if people get up to no good while we were away. ",Classic
131532," Hold this.   There.   Let's give them the benefit of the doubt, assume it was an accident.   But this isn't. ",Classic
17704," Yes, yes, indeed. ",Classic
146043, That's three I's in one breath. Makes you sound a rather egotistical young lady. ,Classic
70076," Brigadier, I already have. ",Classic
41935," Songsten, is this true? ",Classic
7299," Ian, no. ",Classic
92944, Huh? ,Classic
84314, They look like eggs. ,Classic
24139," Just do as he says, child. This may be very difficult. ",Classic
134315," You go on, Doctor. I'll stay with Nyssa. ",Classic
163215," Professor, there's a whole pile of tinheads setting up on the road down there. ",Classic
84089," No, hang about, old son. No panic. I've been wanting to have a word with you. ",Classic
34377," No. Disappeared, you say? How? ",Classic
45160," We can't without the emergency key, and Salamander has it in there. ",Classic
40147," Working non-stop without interruption, maybe seventy two hours.",Classic
79532," The beam should have desensitised. Of course, you fool. It's antimatter! The opposite effect! Instead of quietening down, I've stimulated it. ",Classic
114250, There is an error in the circuitry. You are not to blame. ,Classic
106275," Oh, no. Er, yes. I don't know. I expect so. ",Classic
53917, We understand. ,Classic
107, I take things as they come. Come on. ,Classic
124376," Three metres by five metres, and I could have had the galaxy. The universe. ",Classic
40768," Oh, a bell. Oh, well now we know what we're looking for. ",Classic
108153," Ah, Citizen Doc-Tor. Welcome. Come in, sit down. ",Classic
104884, Good. Right. Then you and your chaps can lead the way and I'll follow. ,Classic
130703, Has anyone ever told you you ask a lot of questions? ,Classic
104715," Oh, come on, man, you can wrap up. I'll lend you some extra clothing. ",Classic
114892," Well, that depends. ",Classic
160594," Very droll, Doctor. ",Classic
82751, Vaber! ,Classic
128582, I left a waistcoat like that on. Ever been to Alzarius? ,Classic
106776, I don't. ,Classic
138535," Please yourself, then, but in my day we were better trained. ",Classic
120930," Good, good. Well, we've just dropped in to say goodbye and to give you this. It's from Erato. ",Classic
21510, Have they located the fugitives? ,Classic
101443, I confess you're a bigger idiot than I thought you were. Argh. ,Classic
99471, You want to see us all die. ,Classic
119479, You should go into partnership with a glazier. You'd have a truly symbiotic working relationship. ,Classic
72675, Okay. What about you? ,Classic
54248," There were at least thirty of them, all UNIT men and all armed, Mister Vaughn. We didn't stand a chance. Out of nowhere. They just came out of nowhere. ",Classic
17297," Well, you can either have some blackberries or some blackberries. ",Classic
3776, Bandits? Where's Tegana? ,Classic
6731, Come on. ,Classic
115961, What! I picked it up. ,Classic
74026, The peace conference must be destroyed. War must break out. ,Classic
71299, You know this is an act of piracy punishable by death under interplanetary law? ,Classic
107951," It'd better do. A little task for you, Doctor. ",Classic
153262," Peri! Hurry!   Back inside, quick.   In you go.   Come on!",Classic
101259," Commander Hildred, Sector seven. ",Classic
50736," All right, we'll go.",Classic
90655," I'm afraid this old body has had it, Miss Smith. ",Classic
152626, What is happening? Activate my Daleks!   How did you find me? ,Classic
150660," They're checking the restaurants. Something I should have thought of. Come on, let's find them before Chessene does. ",Classic
16405,"   Aye, that'll be the island of Santa Maria. One of the Azores group. We're making poor time, Mister Richardson. And now it becalmed, after the storm. ",Classic
148113, Do you think he suspects the truth of matters? ,Classic
143125," What? It's all over, can't you see that? ",Classic
39404, Yes. ,Classic
105233, It was very dark. ,Classic
5377, Thank you. ,Classic
46091," And as such, Mister Chorley, you are no more than a passenger. Staff, lights please. ",Classic
135081, So did I.  ,Classic
8476, This is our navigator. She is going to lead us back. ,Classic
139277, Hmm. ,Classic
46999, Doctor! ,Classic
121385, What are you doing? ,Classic
130436, Darkness. Understanding nothing. Hurt. Heal me. ,Classic
68558, Is that wise? ,Classic
25292," Look, you must try. We've got to concentrate together. ",Classic
90371," Moss may be in the garden, if he hasn't run away altogether, of course. ",Classic
111909, What is it? ,Classic
122598," I don't know, but I'll tell you something interesting. When I mentioned the black hole to Soldeed, he didn't seem to know what I was talking about. ",Classic
82559," Good. Right, that should do it. Now I want you to take off immediately. Get the truth back to your respective governments. ",Classic
152633, No! Take him! He is the sworn enemy of the Daleks. He is the Doctor. ,Classic
158390," I will lead the main party. You two, guard them. Come. ",Classic
134127," Heathrow, Doctor. ",Classic
115320," Yes. It's on Grendel's estate, in the woods near the castle. ",Classic
45608, There must be someone manning the phone. ,Classic
64877, You're taking them away? ,Classic
154794, I know where it is. ,Classic
121354," No, no. Come on, Dymond, now. Don't lose your nerve. We're almost there. Just a bit longer. ",Classic
18419," Well, you did kill one of them. ",Classic
4615, Where are my friends? ,Classic
121877, Good. I'm ready. ,Classic
73461," Right, they're clear of the house. Have you finished? ",Classic
129703, Why should they? ,Classic
135630," Tell him, girl. ",Classic
152474, Fat? Me fat? My figure is the height of fashion! ,Classic
88921, He'd never do that. ,Classic
84345, United Nations ,Classic
127408," May I ask what you have in mind, Consul? ",Classic
136972, The Mara's gone for ever? ,Classic
7786, Theory? ,Classic
116918, No. ,Classic
123248, Stay back. ,Classic
37250, It's a machine that takes your photograph. ,Classic
49346," Let me get this right, Bill. You say the Bernalium is ",Classic
97030," Get after him, man! ",Classic
66170, It's been sabotaged. ,Classic
82613," Come on. That's it, yes. Careful. ",Classic
36965, Possibly. It's doesn't matter The important thing is that nobody should find him. Arrange disposal. ,Classic
48977,"   Very odd, sir. Been getting one or two funny signs here and there all the time. Soon as you check them out they vanish. ",Classic
22235," You know, Trev, this puts a new light on the game. ",Classic
148920, Set thee down and I'll see if I can find Mister Stephenson. ,Classic
148188, What is it? ,Classic
32328," So, Bragen, you want my cooperation, do you? ",Classic
139686, No! You've got it the wrong way round. She's holding level with us! She's moved in for the kill. ,Classic
105037," No, no, the zigma experiment was a success! A brilliant, total success!   Sin, Sin, what are you doing?   I order you to. No, no, not me. This is mutiny, Sin. ",Classic
102322," If he can be killed, then he is not the Evil One, because the Evil One is a god. ",Classic
143761, He's dead. ,Classic
72412," Now you're sure you're all right? Look, you'd better come and sit in this chair over here. Come on. ",Classic
70899," It's not necessarily out mistake. As things have turned out, this planet doesn't seem very suitable for colonisation. ",Classic
112618," Kimus, you are a dangerous fool. Don't listen to him, Mula. If you love your brother, you must shelter him, hide him, protect him from the Mentiads. Remember what happened to your father. ",Classic
23817," Well, do you know where it is? ",Classic
161364, Yes. The only substance to which they're vulnerable. ,Classic
136047," Of course it is. Life under the Mara must have been gruesome in the extreme. I mean, look.   Oh, it is grotesque. You ought to take more interest in our heritage. ",Classic
113717,"   The leader of a Brownie pack. Doesn't the blood upset you, then? ",Classic
160730," I'm glad to see you again, Trevor. I don't think I've had the pleasure. ",Classic
42771, We do not need help. ,Classic
27016," You know. Real wind, real rain, real sunshine. ",Classic
38212," He's lying. The planes themselves are the miniaturisation chambers and they work both ways. What kind of continued existence would we have, Doctor? ",Classic
165102, Talk?,Classic
107169, Disconnected? ,Classic
148636," That won't be necessary. Keys. Thank you. Out.   We must have stopped the process before the final transformation was complete. Without final phase bombardment, their bodily metabolism is reasserting itself. The guards must return soon. You said there's supposed to be an escape exit? ",Classic
14219, I will do you no harm. ,Classic
160173, Trust me. ,Classic
52352," I believe you're actually beginning to enjoy all this. That wasn't there before, was it? ",Classic
77669," Okay, Ruth, switch off. We've done it! ",Classic
29694," I know, Captain. I know. ",Classic
47112," Foam, you silly. You often get it on the sea shore. ",Classic
164371, She's no use to you now. She's evolved as well. ,Classic
86123, Then we've got between five and ten minutes to get out of here before we're all blown to kingdom come. ,Classic
89763, I don't know how to fly it. ,Classic
145392, The red cloth? It's disgraceful. ,Classic
69727," UFO, sir, coming in fast.",Classic
99165," Everything will be all right, Hargreaves, just as long as we keep him in there. ",Classic
25193," Yes, but what about ",Classic
129692, Then I will cut it off. ,Classic
95180, To visit the Duke. We're going to Forgill Castle. ,Classic
90616," Welcome, Doctor. ",Classic
88451, Because he has been sent here to stir up the miners. ,Classic
28060, Got it right. Time And Relative Dimensions In Space. ,Classic
119404," I think that is exactly the question I ought to be asking you, Doctor.   ",Classic
11862, Yes. My family have always been associated with the land. ,Classic
133733, In a manner of speaking. ,Classic
123717," I cannot interfere. I was afraid it would come to this.   Yes, please, ask him to come. ",Classic
88649,   Bye. ,Classic
66119, What are you talking about? ,Classic
126949, So? ,Classic
40856, This is possible. ,Classic
73173, Then you're proposing to do nothing about it. ,Classic
123364, Vargos will explain. ,Classic
149770, Yes.. but did you see the one that got away? That magnificent gumblejack that was trying to eat this poor little fellow. There. ,Classic
159926," Steady on? You drag me down from Cambridge, you quote the Peace Time Emergency Powers Act at me, and then you expect me to advise on something outside the realm of human experience. Bluntly, Group Captain, we're reliant on the Doctor because only the Doctor knows what is going on. ",Classic
100153, You follow a murderer and a tyrant. It is to the Duke Giuliano you owe allegiance. ,Classic
65788, After all that? ,Classic
118588," Well, let's just say I might tamper with it. ",Classic
54969, That girl. Now where has she gone? ,Classic
58570," Yes, all right.",Classic
130743, I think he means us. ,Classic
155774, Why is it none of you can see what's so glaringly obvious? ,Classic
33183, Beware. They're spies. ,Classic
165780," No, you're not. Why do you keep calling me that? ",Classic
17708," Oh? Forgot? Forgot what, child? ",Classic
129819," Absurd. So he believes that to travel faster than light would mean going backwards in time, back to the Big Bang? ",Classic
161428, Yes. But if we could only jam their signal. Have you got a tape? ,Classic
145004, Logar had very little to do with it. ,Classic
67969," Well, the first was a man called McDermott, the second, Farrel. ",Classic
49835," Section Twelve. Section Twelve. Will you please come in?   Calling Power house. Power house, will you please come in?",Classic
47854," Wait! Well, where do you think she is? Do you think it has anything to do with this seaweed stuff? ",Classic
131834, Where's the Doctor? ,Classic
18308, Power units off. Guns down. Power unit readings. One? ,Classic
43541," At least I will live to regret it. Now, the reactor. Shut it down, quickly. ",Classic
90717," I tell you, Brigadier, there's nothing to worry about. The brontosaurus is large and placid. ",Classic
93221, Yes. And I learnt a great deal more from them than they did from me. ,Classic
6203, Name him. ,Classic
19375, It's deserted. ,Classic
146784, We've already told him. ,Classic
149364, Is he? The Master. ,Classic
117809, Brixton. London. Earth. ,Classic
23289, And that is what happened. If it hadn't been for the Viscount de Laran the Captain would almost certainly have caught her. It was pure mischance.   I'm sure she couldn't have made any sense of what we said. Simon Duvall has gone to the inn where she escaped and the Captain has gone to find an aunt of hers. I'm certain that it's only a matter of time. In fact one of them may be bringing her back here now. ,Classic
160326," You're right, I didn't give it, but then, I don't have to. I'm on official business from Galactic Centre. ",Classic
113731, How would I see this Mister De Vries? ,Classic
113430, Rematerialisation commence now. ,Classic
111366," According to my instructions, it's the core to the Key of Time.",Classic
73979," The usual battle gear. Radio, disintegrators. ",Classic
34730," Yes, you're right. Quite so. I'll help. We've got a long way to go yet. ",Classic
70744, Our food stocks are getting lower all the time. We can't even support ourselves. ,Classic
31358, Of course. To the space capsule. ,Classic
114160, What do you mean? ,Classic
28680," Yeah, but she was in there. What could have happened to her? As far as I can make out they've got everyone else. ",Classic
39533," Oh, I see. ",Classic
50802, Now perhaps we can get on with our work. ,Classic
22682, No. His arrogance and greed have a further use for us. Alert the council to attend their final conference.,Classic
130882, I can't. It hurts me. ,Classic
113837, Romana! ,Classic
36165," Medok's made a further statement, Pilot. It's about the Doctor. ",Classic
90646," Be silent, Lupton! ",Classic
133104," Well, my arms are only this long. I can't get any further away.",Classic
112490, That's extraordinary. ,Classic
148501," He'd have liked that, sir. ",Classic
81361, This close to Earth? ,Classic
87369," Trap Two. Sergeant Benton here, sir.",Classic
131939, There are only four of you? ,Classic
62281, Are they supplying any more or is the tableau complete now? ,Classic
121267," Yes, where is your ship, by the way? ",Classic
4610," I shouldn't worry too much about that. That young schoolmaster friend of yours is very resourceful. Whilst he's free, our chance of rescue is still good. ",Classic
7531," Be patient. We're all on your side really, you know. ",Classic
161694," You might need me in the future, then? ",Classic
153583," Not at all, lad. Not when there are things to carry. Anyway, Dibber, if we should run into the Doctor again ",Classic
6077, Well at least she is safe there. ,Classic
12507," They did, my dear, yes, but that isn't the answer here.   They've left his belongings too. ",Classic
19331, I named this ship The Ark. They'd never heard the name 'til I used it. ,Classic
9685," Barrass knows me by sight, I'm sure of that. He could even know of you, Doctor. Now my plan, if you agree, is for Barbara and Ian to attend the meeting. ",Classic
83890," Right. What's got twenty legs, a yellow body about two inches long and big red pincers on the front end? ",Classic
72685," All right, I'll lay things on. ",Classic
86199, Sir. ,Classic
45700, Yes. ,Classic
6694, Grandfather! ,Classic
4048," What are you talking about, Ian? The Crusaders were in the Holy Land twenty five years ago. ",Classic
124730," No, its still Gallifrey. If the Doctor's theory's right, we'll need a local image translator to see what's out there. ",Classic
54942, I'm warning you. One step nearer. ,Classic
17741, The old man who journeyed here spoke of a Viking invasion descending on us. And the Monk asked us to light beacon fires on the clifftops. ,Classic
151372," Not as long as I'd have liked, but it will have to do. ",Classic
112238," Oh, the wonders of modern technology, my boy. This remarkable piece of equipment of a jethrik detector. In that bag, I perceive. ",Classic
54613, Sir. T minus thirty two seconds. ,Classic
45055, Others? ,Classic
86681," Oh, Brigadier, have your fellows brought the Tardis back to UNITHQ for me yet? ",Classic
118521, You're too kind. ,Classic
57350," Now, that's the Ice-Warriors' homing beam. Let's see if I can produce that exactly. ",Classic
165336, Kill her. ,Classic
126730," Well, if this works, we'll need to see where we're going. ",Classic
100302, Sire. ,Classic
133471," Right, we're moving out. ",Classic
148359, This'll sort them out. ,Classic
56281, I'm listening. ,Classic
124238," We're taking off, Brotadac. If you want to come with us, I suggest you close the doors. ",Classic
75709, You'll reach seabed in a few minutes. Tell us immediately if anything goes wrong. ,Classic
28125, Is there no way of fixing it so it can give the wrong answers? ,Classic
110928, Should it be? ,Classic
155257," Oh, it's you, the comedian. What do you want? ",Classic
127684, A tighter ship? ,Classic
46158," Yes. Just push the trolley down the gradient, and that should give you enough time to get clear. ",Classic
48811," I've heard of a square meal, but this is ridiculous. ",Classic
33977," It's breathtaking. Oh, sorry. That wasn't meant to be a pun. ",Classic
58294, No panic. ,Classic
122546, Of course! That would account for the hymetusite in the nuclear furnace. It's immensely powerful. An amazing bit of engineering. ,Classic
24397," Exactly, my child. Yes. ",Classic
74694," Then we must make use of yours, Princess. ",Classic
40882," Oh let's go back, Jamie. Jamie. Jamie! ",Classic
90392, Why can't I see you? ,Classic
126629, It might. The hull is made of dwarf star alloy. ,Classic
4489, Go. ,Classic
135345," If you remember, you were asked to return Romana, and you failed to do so. ",Classic
123236, But this isn't science. ,Classic
87319, Oh no you don't! ,Classic
118025, Ah! ,Classic
92711," That�s wild talk, Erak. Far from killing me, you should treat me as an honoured guest. ",Classic
140538, Hang on a minute.   Catch hold of this. ,Classic
126663," Come on, let's find the Tardis. ",Classic
84875, Such as a little touch of brainwashing? ,Classic
45331, Father! ,Classic
22627," I'm afraid not, young man. ",Classic
155777, Logic? ,Classic
44160, And take over. I see. The Zone would be yours. ,Classic
42446," But if we don't use the ioniser, what then? We are part of a world plan. Now, if we hold back that plan cannot go into operation. ",Classic
147692, We are about to materialise. ,Classic
99576," Quick, Sarah, the button. The button! ",Classic
164777," A secret door? Yeah, well, I'm sure the noises came from over this side.   What happens if we do find something? ",Classic
112, The torch. ,Classic
26748, I heard. ,Classic
61940," Shot him, eh? ",Classic
82654, How did you come here? ,Classic
32803, What was that? ,Classic
67941," Doctor, this is Mister Brownrose from the Ministry. He's come to us with a rather alarming story. ",Classic
53986, I'll get in touch with my photographic unit and get them onto it. ,Classic
26514," Oh, I'm sorry. Is that better? ",Classic
69730, Velocity twenty mps ,Classic
52505,"   Cancel. Doctor test report failure. Oh, I think I'm beginning to understand. ",Classic
22331, It's Earth. I've seen that place before. ,Classic
20243, You mean you're too frightened to fly it yourself. ,Classic
119825, Like we have at home. ,Classic
74611, So you want us to spend a lifetime searching for these mythical tunnels. A coward's devious excuse. Take him to the pit. ,Classic
28729," Yeah. Haven't you anything you can suggest, Doctor? This is urgent. ",Classic
17733, The play Hamlet on television. ,Classic
144767," Wretched citizens of Sarn, you turned your backs on the lord of the fire mountain and listened to his enemy. ",Classic
40833," Look, we must be careful. This could be dangerous. Wait while I get that sword. ",Classic
109300, Stars? ,Classic
34208, A difficult task. ,Classic
38206," Good. Commandant, this is the Doctor speaking. ",Classic
60544," No, but I must get the processing machine. ",Classic
51941, I can't! ,Classic
126956," Murder? Here, in the precincts of the court? ",Classic
5578," Well, it's a start, anyway. ",Classic
65544, What? ,Classic
76401, Now it is my duty to set out the final conditions that Earth Council has laid down. ,Classic
69695, And scrupulously filed. ,Classic
102731," There's only one way to find out, isn't there. ",Classic
83584,   I've never seen a Dalek like that before. ,Classic
134097," Ah, you're forgetting the Tardis. ",Classic
139739, Not quite. Don't forget Turlough's over there. ,Classic
14763, Do you have news for me? ,Classic
71116," Later, Jo, later. ",Classic
13736," Hrostar, the spearhead must be warned. ",Classic
54740," Right, get the men out as soon as we've taxied in. ",Classic
37071," Well, that's another thing. She's vanished. ",Classic
143379, What do you mean? ,Classic
125630, So? ,Classic
89599," Turn around. Turn around, I say. ",Classic
60989," Well, we have been there, and if we can get a big enough army together, I can take you all there. ",Classic
134929, The Doctor's going to materialise round the Master's Tardis. ,Classic
84328, Looks like a pumping control to me. That's not a security area. ,Classic
44429," There must be some other way. I couldn't do it, Salamander, I couldn't do it. I stood there with this man's life in my hands and. This powder, I couldn't use it. ",Classic
106936," He's out, exercising Leaky. ",Classic
20996," Yes. Well come on, Doctor, what's so special about that box? ",Classic
11584," Oh, good, good. I knew they'd give us food if we told them. Oh, well. She'd have been captured anyway.",Classic
158155," Well, you see that navi-pod? It needs to be unbolted so we can replace the broken crystal. ",Classic
124139, I'm going to seal off the city. We'll search every area. ,Classic
147016," No, please, Lord Mestor. ",Classic
73827, Is it the same man? ,Classic
147084," Well, certainly not that thing. Neither will Azmael, he's dead.",Classic
160096, Shuttle force has encountered heavy resistance from renegade Daleks. ,Classic
80156," The male is called Vorg, it seems. The female, Shirna. ",Classic
16506," Well, you got if you want to, but I'm staying near the Tardis.",Classic
75014, Forget it. It's not your problem. Black or white? ,Classic
30773," Well, what can I do? Cutler holds all the cards.  R/ ",Classic
62278," Yes, sir? ",Classic
99135," You're working for a madman, Scorby, you know that? ",Classic
153954," Oh, you aren't going to come to any harm. It's quite safe.   As long as you don't hang about. ",Classic
78574," Yes, of course. How else do you think they communicate? Well, that decides it. I've got no option. Now listen to me, Jo. When I go out there, I want you to ",Classic
102931, It's basically hardened alloy. Scored all over. It must come in under great pressure. ,Classic
158661," Well, the mutinous rabble, they tried to take command of my spacecraft. I relieved myself of them for seventeen crowns a piece. Rather more than they were worth, I think. ",Classic
20485," Oh, no. Let it not happen. ",Classic
35149," Listen, are you really a medical doctor? ",Classic
39992," Well, it's all too easy, isn't it? ",Classic
54084, I think that we better get back. Come on. ,Classic
10855, No. The Africa group have faded out completely. ,Classic
145009," Amyand, I'll need your help as a guide. We must get to the seismic control centre.  AMYAND; I'll do my best.   Turlough, when I've got the Tardis working, we'll materialise here and take the Sarns on board. ",Classic
75917," I'm going to get on to the Minister, and I'm going to ask him to seek approval for an immediate attack with nuclear weapons. ",Classic
33333," Yes. You wouldn't want another headache, now would you? ",Classic
136692, Where are they? ,Classic
18070, The Rills were quite right. ,Classic
89530," Good afternoon, my brother. ",Classic
46801," Now, that's it then. ",Classic
130048, Of course I do. ,Classic
52110," Eh? Don't you start, Zoe. I've had enough from the Doctor. I tell you I'm me, Jamie! ",Classic
164166," Sorry, Professor. ",Classic
121584, Affirmative. ,Classic
140536, Now what? ,Classic
33149," Right, Mister Trask, that's the lot. ",Classic
95094, Excellent. Now the female human is alone. ,Classic
157161, Why is that? ,Classic
137801, Doctor! ,Classic
107273," Yes. I was careless. Come on, get up. Come on.   You're becoming a metracion generator, aren't you. ",Classic
4082, Of course he will. ,Classic
99821," Oh, simple. I should have thought of that. ",Classic
115603," I shall give you a fencing lesson before you die.   En garde!   You improve, Doctor. ",Classic
158996," Oh, Doctor! ",Classic
21606, There's only one guard. Now you know what to do? ,Classic
104914," How can you understand the functions of a catalytic extraction chamber, Doctor? Part of a technology far beyond your time. ",Classic
163615," Do you want to drive, Doris? ",Classic
147830, Almost. ,Classic
130713, We're lost. ,Classic
41844," Instructions. Travers, can you remember any more of what happened to you on the mountain? ",Classic
112637, This is a forbidden object. ,Classic
7147, What's that noise? ,Classic
107016, Japanese? ,Classic
161541," Unfortunately, that will not be possible. ",Classic
36940," Listen, what's all this about a police box on the runway? Oh. Well, security's got to be tightened up all round. He reports that four suspects were seen running away from it. ",Classic
135628," A friend of yours, Doctor. Please, your word not to interfere or she must suffer. ",Classic
18696, Just. ,Classic
146570, The penalty is death. Have you anything to say? ,Classic
109239," Not here. Must have doubled back, damn Trogs. Know these warrens like the back of their hands. Security, not enough men. We're clearing out. I want tunnel nine, main and ancillary workings closed down once we're clear. Stand by for fumigation. ",Classic
63477, Where is the Doctor? Where did he go? ,Classic
114166, Crystals? ,Classic
72589," A spaceship, fifteen inches long? ",Classic
56121, What about us? ,Classic
109234, I don't know. I'll ask him. ,Classic
60355, But he must be informed. ,Classic
30576, We shall not be affected. ,Classic
126404," Prompt him. Go on, more. ",Classic
44430," I give you the chance to become something. Somebody. You failed to take it, huh. ",Classic
82722," That's nonsense! You've come to spy on us. What are you doing on this planet? Here, of all the planets in the galaxy! Answer! ",Classic
91762," That means there's hope for Sarah. Yes, look, she's moving.   Something you want?   Hey, look, can't I do that for you? Independent sort of bird, isn't she. ",Classic
74578, You weren't talking to him? ,Classic
117360," Yes, sir. ",Classic
56906, How is he? ,Classic
83209," Yes, I know that ",Classic
139896," No, no, too well documented. ",Classic
18909, Shh. You'll frighten the child. Come on. ,Classic
162085," Iniphitus, where the Galvanic Catastrophods are not what they were.   No, but they're still worth a look if you're doing a tour of the southern nebula and have an eon or two to spare. You. Well, well. ",Classic
75843, But left the engines alone. ,Classic
139643, I'm going to change. I've had about enough of this outfit. ,Classic
28563, Why not? ,Classic
164773," Oh yeah. Hang about, these inscriptions are a thousand years old. ",Classic
42506, How? You can't get them out by yourself. ,Classic
89849, To talk to the Doctor. ,Classic
3903," Yes, my lady. ",Classic
89301," He must have quite a start on us, too. ",Classic
140351, Why not? For a while. We could do with a rest.   Ah! ,Classic
21488, Ah. We could attribute it to a too-efficient security system. It'll show conclusively that we're completely allied to the Daleks. They would trust us the more. ,Classic
138516," I don't know. Oh, no. ",Classic
29040, No more I'm not. ,Classic
66094," Come on, come on, come on! ",Classic
152247," You know, if the statue actually had been made of stone, I doubt if it'd have killed you. ",Classic
24609, I will challenge them like this! ,Classic
147487," But you were curious. You wanted to know more about him. An act we may all live to regret. Not only is he from another planet, but he's also a professional killer. There. ",Classic
124535, Don't you? Isn't that what the star's for? ,Classic
97300, But the village. ,Classic
127843, A gravity bubble? ,Classic
142345, Look at it. Does it look familiar? ,Classic
38741, He is in the house. I have done everything you asked me to.,Classic
31787, Okay. ,Classic
90950," Er, it isn't dangerous, is it? ",Classic
52999, Not at all.  Packer? ,Classic
114104," Good grief, I don't believe it. ",Classic
105412, It's imperative that I reach London before the market opens. ,Classic
115421," Disarm the Count, then, and bring him in. ",Classic
139510, Look after Tegan. ,Classic
87021, You mean they'll kill me? Perhaps the time that I spent in suspended animation has affected my thinking in some ways? Take me back to the elders. Let me talk to them again. ,Classic
107430," And a wicked old devil he were, too. ",Classic
130407, I never think twice about anything. Wastes too much time. ,Classic
75805," If you'll release the submarine and its crew, yes, as a gesture of good faith. ",Classic
114425, Ha! ,Classic
91291, And what do you propose to do with that? ,Classic
29793," Oh, for heavens' sake boy, some kind of code and I'm trying to work it out. ",Classic
95868, It doesn't make sense. ,Classic
40933," There is, for me. Let them meditate. Let them consult. I, Khrisong, will act. Bring me the prisoner.",Classic
100550, Will you shut up! ,Classic
141389, Very probably. ,Classic
113857, Good for you. ,Classic
92320, How can we do that? ,Classic
60627, Haven't you traced them yet? ,Classic
69913," Very good, sir. ",Classic
69287," It's rather like making a film, isn't it, sir. ",Classic
98458," A time-bomb, Mister Dunbar, a time-bomb. Are you in contact with the expedition? ",Classic
153805, Look! ,Classic
57042, Doesn't sound much like Fewsham. ,Classic
102043, Yes? ,Classic
104765," So, you choose to pry on the House of the Dragon. Unwise. Very unwise. You will suffer for it. ",Classic
128556, I suppose this is the mean free path tracker. And this panel must be a referential difference. ,Classic
23172," Oh, you don't know the man. The Abbot of Amboise is the Cardinal of Lorraine's right hand. With the Cardinal in Rome, the Abbot has decided to come to Paris. We shall be hunted down. That man is far more dangerous than the Cardinal. ",Classic
73140," Do you, Doctor? You always were an optimist, weren't you. ",Classic
94641, What explosive force is required to sunder the planet at that depth? ,Classic
129313, Is there another space pack? ,Classic
35516," Earth Control calling Moonbase. Come in, please. ",Classic
101584, Is that it? ,Classic
93266, But I'm not allowed in the city. Security here is absolute. ,Classic
122052, Doctor. ,Classic
56229, But you could have come over with me. We asked you to join us. ,Classic
6614," So she's the one to be punished. I must stop it, Autloc. ",Classic
99778," Well, it depends, doesn't it. ",Classic
8983, How do you do. ,Classic
135730, You found him? ,Classic
118241," I said, we've arrived. We got there. ",Classic
160542, Enough! Where are my specimens? ,Classic
69489," Yes, yes, all right. ",Classic
61329," Doctor! Doctor, that came from the landing bay! ",Classic
148954, Ask him. Ask him why he's trying to take the bread out of your mouths. ,Classic
81994, Dale! Over here! ,Classic
93610, He's still very much in charge. ,Classic
71730, Well? ,Classic
131324, But this one's in armour. ,Classic
125641," Yes. It's an Arrow class scout ship, Romana. It detaches from the main vessel for local exploration. ",Classic
123643, Have a baby.   I think we're redundant here. Let's go. ,Classic
117169," Doctor, when you went into the furnace after K9, the Marshal almost went berserk at the thought you might be killed. ",Classic
1369," I'm afraid so. From everything the young girl said, the Daleks are certainly very suspicious of others. ",Classic
124775, Decider Draith. ,Classic
40847, Me? I haven't attacked anyone. I found the haversack on the mountain. ,Classic
124496, Ten zero eleven zero zero by zero two. K9 is right. ,Classic
44851," Reaching full power here, Swann.  ",Classic
138713," If I bring back the intruders, your position is mine, remember? There he is. ",Classic
142560, No! ,Classic
31495, I can. And that's why we have to stay.,Classic
140035, You escaped from Xeriphas. ,Classic
15696," It's all right, dear boy. It's not, it's not the circulation freeze. ",Classic
63994, The one who remains here will die. ,Classic
93965," If they've changed things round, the Tardis might materialise in the forward control rooms. ",Classic
66679," Well, you heard what he said. All the exits are being guarded by a bunch of trigger-happy thugs. ",Classic
78660, Now do you believe me? ,Classic
64842, And? ,Classic
149963," I sensed it was very old, but its mind will be of use. Bring it through. ",Classic
3974," Thank you, Ping-Cho. Oh dear, I have ink on my fingers. I will join you there. ",Classic
6366, What did he want? A miracle? ,Classic
26929, Stay. We kill this man. ,Classic
547, I expect so. ,Classic
17819," You know, I'm beginning to like the idea of being a crew member on a time machine. ",Classic
6617," But Susan will be punished first, before the sacrifice. ",Classic
82090," Er, may I ask where we're going? ",Classic
103399, That will not be necessary. You repair the remote controls. ,Classic
84396," Perhaps, perhaps not. He was acting very strangely. Didn't seem to know which side he was on. ",Classic
94533, It's blocked. ,Classic
100548, Yes. Yes. I understand. ,Classic
31669, We should have stayed with Quinn. ,Classic
41316, I don't see. ,Classic
94003," Yes, but can we trust our agent? ",Classic
138438, Your cure. The Garm's found Bor. ,Classic
23849, Doctor!,Classic
154928," Relevant, I hope. ",Classic
100357," Oh! Coming. Hey, thanks for inviting me to the ball. Smashing.   Hey, what did you think of Leonardo? ",Classic
155789," And there you have it. The direct request. I did not meddle. I was presented with an appeal, and not just from anybody, but from the man in whom authority was vested. ",Classic
38851, The female human being has been moved. ,Classic
159026, We don't mean you any harm. Do you understand? ,Classic
72251, Thirteen nil. ,Classic
131909, It's all right. How do you do? I'm the Doctor. Are you in charge here? ,Classic
105293, A fireball? A fireball? ,Classic
122936," Well, I never finished the modifications to the conceptual geometer. ",Classic
87375," Look, sir, I've got to send those reinforcements. The Brigadier's in trouble. ",Classic
103403, The refrigeration and filtering systems are broken.   Pilot Toos. ,Classic
125729, Adric? ,Classic
88296," He won't talk to you. These people are fanatics, Doctor. ",Classic
100271," But they lost. You know, the worse the situation, the worse your jokes get. ",Classic
42982," I've come to regard you as Penley's replacement, and. All right, all right. But it's strictly under protest. ",Classic
64599, I don't think so. ,Classic
68971," Keep it quiet in here.   It's starting up again, sir. ",Classic
56296," We can do it, Daniel. I know we can. ",Classic
54073, Third time lucky. ,Classic
103131," Oh, so we've caught one.   But not soon enough, though. ",Classic
124479, Sorry. ,Classic
49402," You're under restriction. I'll have you back to Earth on the next ship that puts in. I want a written report on the whole affair, and I want it in my hands tomorrow morning, first thing. That's all.   He's confined to quarters. Tanya, you'll have to take over some of Leo's operations. ",Classic
60231," Oh but surely you must know, in your position. ",Classic
95855, Power jets to lock in positions. ,Classic
104454," I deserve death. I had the chance to kill our enemy, Doctor, and I failed. ",Classic
14534, Where is she? What have you done with her? ,Classic
162087," But of course. Come and join us, Doctor. It's one big happy family here, eh, Nord? ",Classic
30172," Yeah, we're still at sea. Here, but that'll explain the few people. Them computers must do all the work now. Here, I wonder if they got to the moon yet. ",Classic
79961, And the latest transference? ,Classic
34421," Now hold on a minute, we could try right enough. ",Classic
18083, But what? ,Classic
112894," That is what we must find out. We must let them lead us into their vessel. The guards have tried to gain entry to it but have failed, so we must allow them a little rope.   ",Classic
87225, Now that I can't believe. ,Classic
126141, We're back in nowhere. ,Classic
26361," Where you're standing, boy, is right in line of fire of my shotgun. I'd keep real quite if'n I was you. ",Classic
20733," Yes, but we must shut the doors first. The old man said you knew the switch. ",Classic
138161, It can't be. ,Classic
65522, Sir? ,Classic
151056, This is madness! What's happening? ,Classic
90896," Oh, I beg your pardon. Well, I just wondered if they might be carrying on your work in robotics? ",Classic
23309, No one's been here. We're closed. ,Classic
44272, Aye. Work on her. I have a feeling she can tell us something about Salamander. ,Classic
110491," Naturally. Well, see to it, Castellan. Oh, and Castellan, if I were you, I'd put them out one by one. ",Classic
151720," Well, how will you stop the missile? ",Classic
98359, Hmm. How many hours in a month? ,Classic
148128, Shut your mouth. ,Classic
151053, No! Why wasn't I told before about this? ,Classic
159176, Can't we just leave the head? ,Classic
123366, This must be solved before dawn. The time is very close. Vargos? ,Classic
50669," In Cully's ship, yes? ",Classic
150037," What does that say, Anita? ",Classic
94224," Humans are reported to have some intelligence. When Vorus, leader of the Guardians, asks you a question, it is not wise to refuse to answer.   Take them out and put them in confinement. I'll question them later.   Greetings, Councillor Tyram. ",Classic
117768, That Romana can look after herself. We are Time Lords ,Classic
291," Yes, that's the immediate view outside the ship. ",Classic
104887, You would be wise not to press me too far. ,Classic
65804," What, and stop the drill? Petra, have you contacted the reactor yet? ",Classic
27550, They have gone into the face of the rock! ,Classic
69530," Afternoon, sir. ",Classic
138017, What are you doing? ,Classic
11956, Come on. ,Classic
72096, The prince? ,Classic
143827, Order an engineer to attend Davros. ,Classic
61570," Right, come along then. ",Classic
99283," No, it's all gone far enough. I'm going for help. ",Classic
149680," Oh, such a soft white skin, whispering of a tender succulence. Dastari will not appreciate its qualities, you know. He has no sensual refinement. Let me buy it from you. ",Classic
136813, Our arrangement. ,Classic
117013," Good. Shapp, when you find the others, treat them properly. ",Classic
119883, It's so green. ,Classic
150987, Do you think I haven't thought of all this already? ,Classic
22222, What are you doing? ,Classic
145854," You're so important to me. I've lived so long in these caves, alone, like an animal. Now I can feast my eyes on your delicacy. I can forget the pain and blackness in my mind. It's all in the past. We could think of the future. ",Classic
27068," Dodo, you're a guest here. Try to behave like one. ",Classic
25824, Oh. ,Classic
93829, Only four more. ,Classic
64427, How on earth? ,Classic
155434," No. Stop her. Stop Lasky.   Got to stop her, stop her. Stop Lasky. ",Classic
868," What, even when it was alive? But that's impossible. ",Classic
161445, What creatures are these? ,Classic
44009," Good luck, Jamie. ",Classic
163976, Drop it. ,Classic
33350, You're the very image of my old granny McLaren. ,Classic
43312, We can get what we want without your help. ,Classic
80022, With that box of tricks there? ,Classic
34860," Ah, please, Doctor. The Tardis isn't out of control or anything is it? ",Classic
146654, What's in there? ,Classic
161489, Tape's still running. ,Classic
96232, What? ,Classic
82096," No, not yet. Let's wait until he gets back to the flight deck, then he'll set the controls. Now, this is an automatic spaceship. Once we're underway, the computers take over, right? ",Classic
93308, We'll find her. We've got to contact the Kaled leaders first. ,Classic
128223, Nyssa? ,Classic
53733, And then there was that deep space radio transmitter. I wonder.,Classic
112790, Who goes down them? Do you go down? ,Classic
81028, The function of this tribunal is to keep this planet clean. This Tellurian creature comes from outside our solar system and is a possible carrier of contagion. Furthermore the creature may be hostile.,Classic
73285, Come over here. Look at this. Now what do you think that is? ,Classic
19177," Oh, and my child? ",Classic
129223," Yes, a trap has now been sprung. We can begin to dispose of all the bait. ",Classic
25952," Well, I must say, this is most unprofessional. I do hope you know what you're doing. ",Classic
22519, That's what I'm worried about.,Classic
159350, No. So what's half a crown? ,Classic
81346, That. ,Classic
52742, I don't see why we had to bring him. He's the one that's caused all this trouble. ,Classic
56926, I wonder what its purpose was? ,Classic
88541," I'm prepared to trust your judgement, Ambassador. But what I believe is of little importance. In the temple, Ortron's power is absolute. There is nothing I can do.",Classic
64369, It says two and two make five. ,Classic
124269, You would never have done it but for us. ,Classic
128202, There is no need. ,Classic
30303," Zeus 4, Zeus 4, can you hear, over? ",Classic
113147," Captain, sir. Come quickly, please. The Mentiads, they're on their way. ",Classic
138259, Olvir! ,Classic
148948," Talks funny, don't he? Hold hard? This hard enough? ",Classic
158363," Yes, looks ready to me, Mel. Well, here goes. ",Classic
145116, Leave us in peace. We wish to die with our sins.   Logar! ,Classic
8606," Funny enough, no. I don't know. Depends where we are. I still could be. ",Classic
100131," I've waited a long time for this moment, sorcerer. There is nothing now that will stop me from becoming Duke. ",Classic
4853, Kill her. Kill her. Kill her.   Kill her! Kill her! Argh! ,Classic
141896," Let go! Let go of me, you     Leave me alone! Let go of me.   You're alive. ",Classic
123089," He's terribly hurt. Come on, clear the area. Clear the area! ",Classic
164480, This is extraordinary! And you learnt about logic at school? ,Classic
100046," Only the dead fail to stand in my presence. However, your lack of courtesy is easily corrected. ",Classic
108798," Well, you could put the plug in if you want. ",Classic
93280, Here's where it comes out into the cave.   Shush. What was that? ,Classic
132786, You've done it before! ,Classic
146232," Elena, check it out, will you? ",Classic
5126, No. ,Classic
128725," Yes, exactly. Zap! Enough zap and you have your thrust. Now, follow this very carefully. ",Classic
76087, This device is causing the power to overload. ,Classic
145994," It's her only chance. Jek, do you know where the queen bats are? ",Classic
37025," What's a passport, Doctor? ",Classic
102281, Back against the wall! ,Classic
144272, Stay where you are. ,Classic
150387," Creatures are, must develop the finest flavour of all. They have the pick of the planet's resources and all that goodness is concentrated ",Classic
131725, Any way through the bars in that window? ,Classic
34657, The food supplies have not arrived and there's a rumour that we're facing starvation. They've all panicked. ,Classic
54712, Take off.,Classic
20079, My nephew Aeneas brings us a little something from time to time. He's in command of our mobile force. Spends most of his time harrying the Greek supply routes with his cavalry. ,Classic
6713, I shall find her. ,Classic
18169, Impossible! ,Classic
122854, I think we're going to be all right. ,Classic
103921," She not asleep, Mister Sin. ",Classic
103627," V4, that is not the Doctor. ",Classic
27751," Don't be ridiculous, young man. Why would I do that? You seem to forget that I am in charge here. Why would I do anything to help our enemies? ",Classic
20695," You're letting your imagination run riot again. Besides, we haven't seen any Varga that look like him. ",Classic
51936, Hmm? ,Classic
98600," That's exactly what is happening, Moberley. ",Classic
130438, I am gone. His brother is their prisoner. ,Classic
63068," Doctor, I'm sorry but I really must ask you to leave. There's something very urgent I have to do before I go back to the centre. ",Classic
12565, I'll have these two and that one. ,Classic
3864," You are in my charge, Tegana, not I in yours. ",Classic
157068, Whoops. Oh. Take them back to the Tardis. ,Classic
60056, What happened? ,Classic
81173, Indeed? ,Classic
90945, It would go on for hours. ,Classic
147810, I rarely do. ,Classic
112268," Well, I admit I had a great trouble with me conscience. Fortunately, I won.",Classic
52210, But I don't understand. ,Classic
109981, What then? ,Classic
70485," Come on! Come on, you must take the load! You must! ",Classic
151661, Where are you going? ,Classic
8083," But obviously untrue, sir.  1 ",Classic
28584," Well, that is for them to decide. How many of them were there? ",Classic
65808, That mightn't be a bad idea. ,Classic
141199, Goodbye. ,Classic
56037," That's only local, surely. ",Classic
16403," But I'm not ready! I'm not ready! We can't meet them now! Oh, good gracious! No, wait a minute. We shall have to land and then take off as quickly as we can again.",Classic
113069," And each planet as it dies, adds to that power. The power by which it will be avenged. ",Classic
52390, You've actually spoken to them? ,Classic
53123," Zoe, I think you ought to stand back. ",Classic
131863, Primitive fools! They have allowed the Doctor to disconnect their power packs. Bring me the Doctor and his companion. I want them here. Go! ,Classic
35712," They've had it, I'm afraid. ",Classic
134061," Well, this morning's Concorde flight from New York disappeared from the radar just after its deceleration. ",Classic
49669," I'd love some, I really would. ",Classic
111357, Beware the Black Guardian. ,Classic
40007, Did you touch anything? ,Classic
33017," Aye, nevertheless, I'm still worried. ",Classic
15350," Oh, penknife. Yes, there we are.   Ah, yes. ",Classic
121471, Vraxoin. Traces of it in his pocket. ,Classic
93997," Exactly. And the shutters were sealed. They couldn't possibly be operated from the after section.   Right, come on, we'll have to check the transom. ",Classic
158118," Oh, thanks, Doctor. We ran into this piece of space junk. What did you do? ",Classic
111216, Where are we? ,Classic
132177, Where are we? ,Classic
132007, That's hardly an argument. ,Classic
117470, The war is over. The bombardment is over. The next step is obliteration. ,Classic
27238," Doctor, I must speak to you. I want to tell you what happened. ",Classic
37717, But don't you realise the expense of phoning Athens. ,Classic
69775, UFO over airline flight path Green One. All civil aircraft scattered.,Classic
151009, I've no other choice but to obey. ,Classic
80796, Kalik is right. The tribunal should observe the correct forms of procedure. ,Classic
80612, Do you really think the Lurman is a spy sent here to test our defences? ,Classic
28638, What's the matter Corporal? ,Classic
118749, Understood. ,Classic
17476," Oh, no, no, not a fleet, this was just a small band of men. They must have come from one ship. ",Classic
108027, What? ,Classic
32841, Not these. ,Classic
162056," Greetings. Not many in today, are there. Are you regulars or is this your first visit, too? Let me introduce myself. I'm   Oh, thank you very much. Delicious. ",Classic
78197, Right! Now we shall soon be ready to move. ,Classic
129721," In ten seconds, please. ",Classic
48897," Good, I'll do an announcement about reverberations. ",Classic
108505, The only way would be to open the valve from the inside. ,Classic
43427, The records wing! It's gone! It's demolished! ,Classic
4669, Where's Barbara? She should be here now. Barbara? Barbara? ,Classic
150998, That's a mirror! ,Classic
8130," We have a custom of shaking hands with someone, in friendship. ",Classic
18185," You may not realise it, but at first I point this at your hand and then I pull the trigger and ",Classic
105886, No. ,Classic
157789, And seen what? ,Classic
7911, I cannot understand why the Second Elder did not bring the antidote here. ,Classic
21358, It's incredible. ,Classic
31187, Hold that.   Tilt it. ,Classic
13816," Spearhead, retreat!   We are surrounded. ",Classic
19269," I asked, who are you? Where did you come from? ",Classic
109896, No. That was an unfortunate oversight. ,Classic
79317, Now what was all that about? ,Classic
132481, What's that?   Ann was wearing this. ,Classic
153268, But how? ,Classic
16861," Yes, you got us out of a nasty situation there. I supposed you'd like to know who we are and why we're here? ",Classic
128065," Of course, and supply the necessary raw energy. ",Classic
132755," Yeah, but not as often as me. ",Classic
159863, Stay where you are. Do not move. ,Classic
148013, Last week. ,Classic

43331, We only fight to win.,Classic
53735, UFOs? What's that? ,Classic
37732," Now, please don't get like him. Oh yes, there is definitely a connection. Now, I would like to get in there and have a look round. ",Classic
77340," Er, no, I'm sorry, sir, I forgot. The tablets are in the care of Professor Sondergaard. ",Classic
78683, We've come here to warn you that ,Classic
16795, Hostile plant life! Destroy! Destroy! ,Classic
39074," Go back to the house, Waterfield. I understand you are under a stress. You try and get some sleep. ",Classic
21780, What happened is unimportant! We have the taranium! The invasion can go ahead. The Universe will be ours!,Classic
58123," Aye, and a missile? ",Classic
56195," Nobody cares any more about exploring space. Life made. Well, it was made too easy by T-Mat. ",Classic
49681, I wouldn't dream of contradicting you. Can you repair the laser gun in time? ,Classic
118989," For a portrait of a Time Lady, that's not at all a bad likeness. ",Classic
138386," It's hardly touched. Take her first, then. ",Classic
81871, Did you? How long is your sentence? ,Classic
43660," Oh no, you're making a mistake, you must be. ",Classic
98132, Master order! ,Classic
75673," It's a message from one of the search vessels, sir. They are getting an echo. ",Classic
55139, The Krotons will come out. ,Classic
56283, Is it? ,Classic
140338," Of course, once everything's run in. ",Classic
70513, Then we must restore his freedom for as long as it serves our purpose.,Classic
22895, Can we? ,Classic
147137, I still think you're doing too much. You need to rest. ,Classic

54927, Keep back! ,Classic
113320, It's the planet Terra in the star system Sol. ,Classic
36797, That was a very brave thing to do. ,Classic
89635," Well, that's what he would say, but he'd be wrong. ",Classic
135501, It's madness. ,Classic
10525," Ian, we must find a way to stop them. We must. ",Classic
45521, Just fine. ,Classic
71280," Well, we wouldn't know about that. ",Classic
62860," Yes, yes, yes. Yes, I'm sure he does. It's just that I'd rather like another word with him myself. It's about those power losses.",Classic
89378," Ah, Professor Clegg. How good of you to come. ",Classic
82552, Oh. ,Classic
60372, Until one of those things arrives. If I can get inside I'm sure I can control it. ,Classic
66543," Yes, yes. Check all the other systems. ",Classic
62912, And? ,Classic
108982, Orfe. ,Classic
86968," Final tests have all been positive. Now, once the power build-up from the reactor is complete, we shall be ready to commence the countdown. ",Classic
97724," Great heavens, you can't go walking on a night like this. I wouldn't dream of letting you proceed one step further. Condo, stir yourself. Our guests are cold and tired and wet and. Let me take your hat, sir. There. Oh. What a magnificent head. ",Classic
138963," No, no. You give me a ship that's bluff in the bow and narrow in the stern. ",Classic
93243, Now this is what the Kaleds will become.   That is our future. ,Classic
36855, Take your hands off her. ,Classic
91527," Doctor, look! ",Classic
78903, You'll do as you're told. ,Classic
111532, The time saved would be worth the risk.,Classic
50074," But what possible use could the Wheel be to these Cybermen, Doctor? ",Classic
37338," Ben! Ben, can you hear me?   Ben, can you hear me? ",Classic
114204," Listen. They're still in the circle, or whatever occupies that space in the other dimension. ",Classic
36298, How can you believe that stuff? ,Classic
134880," Andrew and I will start with the cockpit check. Roger, I want you to do a walk round the whole aircraft. ",Classic
31328," Yes, I suppose so. ",Classic
146370, So he did. ,Classic
95918," So that you can be hailed as the saviour of civilisation? No, Professor. My orders were simply to find your party and get back. ",Classic
156506, I have no idea. ,Classic
129592, Here you will be comfortable. I was. ,Classic

146050, We would like to see her. ,Classic
125158, They'll learn to breath the air. ,Classic
120740," Yes, talk, talk. After Adrasta stole his communicator he was just trying any way he could to make contact. ",Classic
146444, Some of this technology looks familiar. ,Classic
65560, We've got to stop him at once. ,Classic
115244," My lord, I did warn you it wasn't ready. ",Classic
134787, We'll have to deal with the Master first. ,Classic
101292, Apparently he is or was at one time a member of that noble Chapter. ,Classic
11020, You mean this is some sort of a key? ,Classic
67639," This plastic has got unique properties, Mister McDermott. Allow me to demonstrate.  Mc ",Classic
83521," I'm sorry, Jo. No, it must be a two-pronged attack to double our chances of success. Have you got the bomb? Whichever group gets there first must detonate that bomb in one of the tunnels near the cooling unit. Block off the Daleks completely. Now, whatever you do, don't damage the refrigeration unit. It's absolutely vital that that continues to function. ",Classic
93531," Listen, I've been down tunnels before and I've just had a rather nasty thought. ",Classic
116561, It doesn't know we're here. ,Classic
125865, Access attempted under all permutations. ,Classic
159779, Tell me now! ,Classic
23692, See how honest men are treated in France? The shot came from that window. ,Classic
126018, Ivo. ,Classic
26023, I insist. ,Classic
79045," No. No, I guess I wouldn't. ",Classic
73458, So what do we do now? ,Classic
164163," Hmm. I'd stand back from that lift, Nimrod, if I were you. To catch a wolf, I may have unleashed a tiger. ",Classic
109897, Thank you. ,Classic
93551," The same for them. But we must move carefully, not force their hands. Let us learn who are our allies and who are our enemies. Leave Gharman here, safely locked away.   What was that? ",Classic
37282," That won't be necessary, thank you. I'll see what I can find out, if you don't mind waiting. ",Classic
156753, With a unique conceptual understanding of the properties of time.,Classic
105855, Organic restructuring is elementary physiology for Time Lords. ,Classic
51789," Now look, I'm not seeing things, you know. It was there, I tell you. ",Classic
158631," Here, you couldn't do us a favour, could you? You see, I'm in a spot of bother. ",Classic
122841," Doctor, I don't know what you think you're playing at, but. Oh! Help. ",Classic
84937," No, none. ",Classic
142087," Ben. Ben, you're mad! ",Classic
7404," They are not carrying any weapons, yet I am frightened of them. ",Classic
59920, We've just been through another one of those mists and we've gone off the edge of my map. ,Classic
30590," We overwhelmed them sir, but there'll be more on their way. ",Classic
81495," There is no sign of any Draconian ships, sir. They are about to board now. ",Classic
98849," No, this is unique now. Priceless, as you are no doubt aware. ",Classic
1786, Show third picture.   They have made contact with the Thals. ,Classic
145559, There's an android permanently on guard out there. Jek's androids are programmed to kill humans on sight. ,Classic
106074, Number two control room has been closed for redecoration. I don't like the colour. ,Classic
159003, Yes. ,Classic
151649, They don't reply. ,Classic
30788," Straight for here, sir. ",Classic
51678," Now just leave it to me, Jamie. You and Zoe go back to the Tardis. Teel, take Kando and Cully and get them to the capsule and go to the Capital. Tell them that there'll be a minor volcanic eruption, but with any luck nothing more violent. ",Classic
40999, You are asking us   You are asking us to agree to murder. ,Classic
146271, I make no excuse. ,Classic
56869, Then do so at once.,Classic
150740, Anything that you may say ,Classic
7770," Just look at that young man. I've done all I can for him at the moment. Given him salt and water. He's been coughing his heart out. I must have chemicals and equipment. His death will be your fault, and yours alone.  1 ",Classic
51655, I will insert the seed device. Prime the rockets at perimeter boreholes. ,Classic
28625, Look out! ,Classic
54382, Okay. Have you got him? ,Classic
156575, Be quiet and don't move. ,Classic
49353, No. ,Classic
119852," All right, but what can you possibly do with the old jawbone of an ass? ",Classic
127234, Yes?   What does that mean? ,Classic
47828, Seaweed? ,Classic
33073, It's so swollen. Does it hurt you? ,Classic
94496," What's this rocket that you speak of, Vorus? ",Classic
12397, Garnished with larks tongues and baked pomegranates ,Classic
42424, No! It has electronic connections. ,Classic
42033," Well nothing, I hope, but one of us just might need help. Are we ready? Come on.",Classic
138480, Where? ,Classic
50886, There is no cause for alarm. I will inform the Director of your arrival. ,Classic
136796, Where are we going? ,Classic
112342," Silence! These caves will not shelter your scum from my missiles. Now, you made a prophecy, old woman. What was it? ",Classic
142212, Show me.   What were you doing in there? ,Classic
80901, Exactly. The Drashigs are only here because of Zarb's liberal-minded weakness. ,Classic
113099, Show me the chart. ,Classic
8554, I'm going to see Ian and Barbara back home safely. ,Classic
112184," You wouldn't understand. For years, I was jeered and derided. I began to doubt even myself. Then you came along, and you told me I was right. Just to know that for certain, Unstoffe, well, is worth a life, eh? ",Classic
21590, Seismic detector shows that the object that he is carrying is the taranium! ,Classic
139399," You will, of course, decline. ",Classic
165425, I can't remember. It's too long ago. ,Classic
27877, There's someone coming. ,Classic
135465," Excellent. Well, Damon, what news of my old companion Leela? ",Classic
33321," Perkins, I want. What the devil are you at, man? ",Classic
140475, What?,Classic
2217, Kristas! ,Classic
124696, Watch out! ,Classic
93027, Then conserve it! Ammunition is valuable and cannot be wasted. ,Classic
99522, And you haven't made contact with the Doctor? ,Classic
64912, Not with bullets. ,Classic
51391," Obviously you must be taught a lesson. Quarks, target! ",Classic
120657," Yes, Doctor?   You were just saying? ",Classic
157104, You're impossible. Why did you do that? ,Classic
18830," Prisoner, you've been found guilty of extreme carelessness in carrying out your duties. By leaving open a wide valve in the heat exchange unit, you could have caused an explosion that would have been fatal not only to the human race, but also to our friends, the Monoids. As your commander, Galactic law gives me wide powers in such cases. The safety of our people must be preserved at all costs. In these grave circumstances, the lightest sentence I can pass is one of miniaturisation. Prepare the Minifier. Sentence will be carried out immediately. The prisoner will be retained at micro-cell size, to be re-constituted in approximately seven hundred years time, when it can no longer be a danger to us. Does the prosecution accept this sentence?",Classic
12107, What was that? ,Classic
92776," Just keep climbing, nice and quiet. ",Classic
69073, Yes. Sir.,Classic
151786, I don't think you've got the nerve. ,Classic
7165," Yes, a door to be opened. ",Classic
8090, Yes. ,Classic
39050, We must. Have you lost your mind? Don't you want to see your daughter again? ,Classic
28370, I'm afraid I don't quite understand. ,Classic
42772, You'd still be frozen and dead if it wasn't for us. ,Classic
17465," It must go on for quite a way, Vicki, if only to get clear of the monastery up there. ",Classic
109435, Into the tunnels! You'll never beat them here! ,Classic
38843, Do not delay. ,Classic
93861, You must wait. ,Classic
121452, That's extremely serious. ,Classic
102277," No, of course not. ",Classic
156610, The heat radiation from the catalyst was of high frequency. ,Classic
135978, So it seems.  ,Classic
104262," Oh, I'm so glad. ",Classic
136631, Doctor! ,Classic
165157, What's it doing? ,Classic
55840, The high brains are entering the Dynatrope. ,Classic
76314, Let him speak. Why are you here? ,Classic
136824," You've been touched by an attendant demon. You must forfeit a coin. It's the custom, I'm afraid. ",Classic
32556," Good, because we're going inside. Come on, Valmar.   Ben, give us that spare cable over there. Polly, keep watch at the door. ",Classic
142665, It's all right. ,Classic
49371, The Controller's mounted an immediate enquiry. I'm much more interested in this. ,Classic
30942," The Cybermen, sir. They must have landed. ",Classic
85534," That's better. Huh. Now, if I could just use your telephone. ",Classic
65895," Krakatoa, the Sundra Straits. During the volcanic eruption of 1883. ",Classic
11769, Yes. ,Classic
46602," Oh, are you sure? ",Classic
31949," Yes, sir. ",Classic
77372," But what about the radiation level? After refuelling, it'll be much higher than ",Classic
61930," She's not just a pretty face, sir. ",Classic
89300," It won't be easy to find him, Doctor. The mountain's riddled with these tunnels. Even the miners don't know them all. ",Classic
32174, I forgot. ,Classic
106397," Coming, sir. ",Classic
82162," Well, personally I'm quite happy to be going to Draconia, Jo. Perhaps we can convince the Emperor what our friend here has been trying to do. ",Classic
158977, I was sixteen. ,Classic
101026, Intruders penetrating level fifty and descending. Intruders penetrating level one hundred and fifty and descending. ,Classic
126226, Misconception of the functional nature of this unit. I neither feel nor find it necessary to express states of efficiency or dysfunction. ,Classic
55055," Aye, they never leave that machine. ",Classic
7550, No opinion can be worse sometimes than a very dogmatic one.  2 ,Classic
129653, Call it twenty five. ,Classic
103554, Toos? ,Classic
89994," I'm, I'm from Earth. ",Classic
92556, If this is Piccadilly. ,Classic
81381," This is the commander of the Draconian battle cruiser. We are locked onto your vessel and are about to board. If you offer any resistance, you will be destroyed. Open the hatch of your airlock. ",Classic
23180, Many things frighten people in Paris these days. ,Classic
22112, They came through here! Where did they go? ,Classic
106672," Oh, well, I can understand that, but do you realise you have no right ",Classic
158500," But it's our patriotic duty to call Washington, Hawk. ",Classic
52140, Sir. ,Classic
65910," Well, if he does, he's a darn sight cleverer than the rest of us.",Classic
122217," I'm going to move the Tardis into the hold of this ship, then we can ride out with it, park somewhere and repair it with as much time as we like. ",Classic
55545,   Go on.,Classic
144281, Where are they? ,Classic
14982," Doctor, open the door! ",Classic
11071, Get that man off there. ,Classic
84202, Then how can I see you? ,Classic
137315," Well, bless my soul. So you've done it again, Doctor.   I must apologise for my cavalier behaviour when we met, Doctor. ",Classic
21472, The experiment had already started. We couldn't stop. ,Classic
75759, No! The Doctor is your deadly enemy! He must be destroyed!,Classic
26926, He is one of the leaders? ,Classic
27921," Come on, get a move on there. Come on, get along.   Come on.",Classic
155309, It is the word the Earthlings used when first they persuaded us to allow them to sink mines on Mogar. ,Classic
18112, Safe. ,Classic
147150, How long will you need? ,Classic
98190, The Doctor is a Time Lord? ,Classic
125582, Camilla. ,Classic
99652, We'll just have to push on and hope we come out the other side.,Classic
125201, Such a momentous decision! ,Classic
164513, Yes? ,Classic
94282, Come on. Pull. ,Classic
120101, Then you don't leave. ,Classic
68686, Thank you. Do I know you? ,Classic
44555, But I still don't know if I can carry it off. ,Classic
125016, What's that? ,Classic
108723, Yes! ,Classic
98957, Yes. ,Classic
8101," I have his sash of office here, so that you may select a new advisor immediately. ",Classic
153466," Then you are a liar. The Doctor is with Balazar, isn't he? And both of them have left the subways. ",Classic
117998, Affirmative. ,Classic
8431, No doubt about it. ,Classic
156620," Oh, yes. Memory like an elephant. A running gag applied to you, I feel sure, Mel. ",Classic
7051," Tell me, have either of you ever met any of these creatures or seen them? ",Classic
72576, I don't get it. ,Classic
4737," I think the excitement's been too much for Susan, too. Come on.   Well, you don't look very happy. ",Classic
49238, Why did you do it? ,Classic
45559," Clear to fire, Staff? ",Classic
55490, How? He won't listen to you. Our people want this war because of what happened to Vana and the others. ,Classic
102174,"   Oh, you. ",Classic
67786, Why were you so interested in my friend's horsebox? ,Classic
151896, Show me. Inform Takis there are body snatchers in the catacombs. ,Classic
83954," At last. Now we can get on. Will you excuse me, sir? ",Classic
29752," Well said, my boy. Now, let's get down to the church and hope that our luck still holds out. Come on, come on. ",Classic
16207, Vicki. Vicki! Vicki! ,Classic
26759," Now Mister Werp, what part am I supposed to be playing in this feud between you and the Clantons? I thought that you gave me this to uphold the law, not ",Classic
136240, You passed out. They brought you in here. Are you feeling better?,Classic
109565, No return of fire. What's going on? ,Classic
87160, There's nobody here to tell. I'd only just arrived when you turned up. ,Classic
74787, But I can't. ,Classic
2033," Yes. Barbara, look! There's a passageway here. ",Classic
76910," As well as I could. As you see, I lack equipment. If it were not for the mutants, I would not have been able to survive here. ",Classic
92956," Yes, where are we? This isn't the beacon. ",Classic
63440," It's a lot of nonsense. The power losses are a technical problem. All I need is more reliable staff, and more facilities. Not a lot of cloak and dagger people cluttering up the place. ",Classic
36395," Ah, yes, but here, you see, the rock foundation is a type of salt. Now at depths it generates gases, over the years, and these gases are extremely valuable. ",Classic
4169, This marriage has the Khan's blessing. Am I to understand that you oppose it? Am I? ,Classic
101824, Yes. Relics from the old time. The Sash of Rassilon. The Key. ,Classic
119139," Good. Thank you, you may go.   But not good enough. Kill them. ",Classic
11505," The Slyther, Ian! It's coming straight for us!   ",Classic
67066, I can see that. Tell the Brigadier. ,Classic
72607, What does any scientist do with an experiment that fails? He chucks it in the rubbish bin. ,Classic
140187," No, I must open it. Other demons may try to harm you. ",Classic
153430, Oh. But my Tardis is an old model. Are you telling me it's been bugged without my knowledge? ,Classic
65340," Oh, only that he's an associate of the Brigadier. ",Classic
110718, Continue with your work. Assist him. ,Classic
150448, Wait! ,Classic
26885, It's yours. ,Classic
142012, It'll take some time for the gas to spread throughout the Base. ,Classic
164499, Will you listen to me? There's evil here. Can't you feel it cold against your skin. ,Classic
111017, Of course I am. ,Classic
132860, You're sure the lifeform's alien? ,Classic
137462," Now. Come on. We've got to get back to the capsule before Turlough works out how to operate it, or I may never get the Tardis back. ",Classic
152196," But in how many pieces? You know as well as I do, the only part of Stengos that exists is his head. The remains you produce for the court will have to be manufactured. ",Classic
128758, What do you want me to do?,Classic
116746, AZeon secret weapon? ,Classic
132706, A lead screen. Some of the newer alloys. ,Classic
46635, This control box. We've got to get it working! ,Classic
4580," Yes, it would seem so. ",Classic
161208," No, Karl. We must not keep history waiting. ",Classic
92959, Heavy artillery. ,Classic
62396, To do so.,Classic
95166," Yes, and you in advance with your second sight, eh? ",Classic
92867, The entire invasion fleet is being held up. How much longer must we wait? ,Classic
123686," Believe me, I understand. ",Classic
2819," I, I ",Classic
16916," No. See, Earth got involved in interplanetary wars. I suppose this place was forgotten. ",Classic
42878," What a triumph. Europe saved. Science the victor over nature, and it happened in my sector. Well, it's not the first time. ",Classic
129110, There is something amiss with the map. ,Classic
151416," Oh, I think not. After what I have to tell him, I think he'll be delighted. And while he's smiling, I shall recommend that he appoints you my deputy. ",Classic
62769," Well, I hardly had time to draw its picture, did I? All I can tell you is that it was something very, very large, and something very, very alive. ",Classic
120217, Vagueness. ,Classic
12331," Pipes, Chesterton, pipes! ",Classic
119207," My dear, nobody could be as stupid as he seems. ",Classic
31888, Do you think he'll believe you? I'll soon convince him that you murdered the man yourself. You stole the Examiner's badge. ,Classic
53682," Don't argue, Packer! Just do as you're told, man! And for once, do it right! ",Classic
95657, An oxygen type. Could be an Earthling. Transfer oxygen to quarantine area. ,Classic
147718, Why? ,Classic
121989," What do you mean, he could be right? How could he possibly be right? He's only a dog, you know. ",Classic
4810, I am to be punished. ,Classic
41643, Indeed. ,Classic
93059, If you've a friend up there they won't last much longer. ,Classic
136957," Mother, let go. ",Classic
97346," It's better than nothing, I suppose. I'm dying for a drink. ",Classic
92779, No. No. ,Classic
19612, We'll do everything we can to assist you in settling on our planet. ,Classic
110364," Just over there, then you can rest. ",Classic
71845, What's the delay? ,Classic
3863," Marco, let me be your sword. ",Classic
124906," No, it wasn't in the cave. ",Classic
58320," Well, now you're in more danger here than you ever will be in space. ",Classic
89434, Stop? Now? On the point of breakthrough? The power in that circle last night ,Classic
100776, My God. He's put the hand in there. ,Classic
48311," They're not, come along!   Jamie, the doors, they're heavy. I can't hold them! Jamie, hurry! Jamie! Jamie, come on! This way, in here. Hurry up, I can't hold them! ",Classic
13354," Wait, wait, stop. ",Classic
124075, Ah. ,Classic
13036, Nero is planning an appearance for him in the arena. It seems ,Classic
27976," Yes, I do. And you're the only man who can, my boy. ",Classic
157329," All right, then. So you were here from the beginning then? ",Classic
131942, You are assuming we plan to coexist. ,Classic
42747, Return to base and wait for the inevitable disaster. ,Classic
46150," Well, that's funny. There's one missing. I wonder where that's got to. ",Classic
130243," Hmm. It's obviously an armoured suit of some kind. I would say its occupant was probably human in shape   Binocular, bipedal, and the whole thing is controlled directly from the brain of the wearer with these. ",Classic
153195, The three Sleepers? ,Classic
124713," Citizens, continue the work of maintenance. ",Classic
30907, He's gonna get worse. Get him up! ,Classic
2818," Really? And I always thought that you were a young man without any recrimination in you. Well, as for you, young lady, well, you were absolutely right. It was your instinct and intuition against my logic, and you succeeded. I mean, the blackouts, and the still pictures and the clock. Well, you read a story into all these things and were determined to hold on to it. We all owe you our lives. ",Classic
142912," Medical centre, quickly! ",Classic
8788," I was sent to bring him home to England. The day nears that his information is important. Find him if you can. Try to escape. Try. Promise to find James Stirling, and home. Promise! Promise! ",Classic
135766," Well done, Hedin. ",Classic
5095," Well, judging by the specimens in here, I'd say he was very successful. ",Classic
82985, Yes. ,Classic
15545, Nothing. We must get some. ,Classic
113185, They are? ,Classic
144407," I keep forgetting how very young you still are. Come, we must hurry. One day, it'll all be clear to you. ",Classic
80539, What is it? ,Classic
42292, Avalanche! Come on! ,Classic
32090," Stop! You heard me, that's an order. Turn away. Fetch the guard. ",Classic
37947, Flipping heck. But she's in there! ,Classic
105980, What? ,Classic
78682," They are the enemies of the Master, and therefore the enemies of our people and our land. ",Classic
100531, What? ,Classic
152789," Apart from me, you mean? I don't know. Shall we find out? ",Classic
100917," Well, you've been on Earth a hundred and fifty million years, and you've lain dormant all that time. ",Classic
132723, We're going down. I realise going down again must be hard. ,Classic
157798, But Blue Kangs have won.,Classic
119973," It doesn't seem to have incommoded you too much, Doctor. ",Classic
94900," Well, what if that gets jammed, too?   Hallo, Fox Inn.   Harry's been shot!",Classic
159469, Borrowing your van. ,Classic
30964," Yes, now quiet! We accept your terms. The warhead will be removed from the rocket. ",Classic
17412, Thanks very much indeed. ,Classic
30644," Yes, sir. ",Classic
123251," Oh, really. ",Classic
99780," On whether the Moon is made of cheese, on whether the cock crows three times before dawn, and twelve hens lay addled eggs. ",Classic
111100, Completely? ,Classic
83640, There's no power left to operate the door. Come on! ,Classic
115159, The peasants are prepared? ,Classic
67978," Well, he was a little worried and depressed, I think, but he certainly wasn't ill. ",Classic
47599, If the main valve is open it could be an echo from any one of those rigs. ,Classic
23954," More orders, I expect. ",Classic
19382," Oh, it's just a feeling I've got. ",Classic
109212, The Quest is the Quest. ,Classic
85973," We're sworn enemies, Doctor. Why should you help me? ",Classic
122100," Suppose, just suppose, someone were beginning to create a black hole. ",Classic
113496," So that means Calufrax, the entire planet ",Classic
120943," I've got a malfunction. Check it out, will you?   Secker, these coordinates are wrong. Did you set these? ",Classic
149025," I wasn't wrong. I knew with you as controller it wouldn't be hypnotism. Not from a chemist of your calibre. What are they, parasites you've specially impregnated? ",Classic
47724," Oh, ja, ja. He has plenty of professional experience of normal conditions, but these are not normal conditions. There is something very strange going on here, but he refuses to accept the new factor. ",Classic
147031, We must mind-link. Together we can destroy him. ,Classic
107949, A thousand talmars? ,Classic
134695," Oh Doctor, please, on top of everything else, not little green men from outer space. ",Classic
128772, The Doctor was doomed. I see that now. ,Classic
86733," Oh, that's marvellous! Where is your HQ? ",Classic
26179," Ah, she saw me fire the gun. ",Classic
147223," Start shooting that thing off, the police'll be calling out the SAS. ",Classic
122944," Oh, not much better. Nasty race of people. Still, they're too busy fending for themselves to bother anyone else now. ",Classic
153824," Oh, he won't listen to reason. He needs black light to function so he sees no reason why the rest of us should survive. That is roughly your narrow, egotistical little view, isn't it, Drathro? ",Classic
47275, Well can I have a pass? ,Classic
161039, You betrayed me! ,Classic
136980, You can't drive the car! ,Classic
75540," If they haven't surfaced by now, then something must be stopping them. All right, submiss procedure. Alert submarine command. We'll set up a full scale search right away. ",Classic
126919, Universal harmony? ,Classic
154130," The Raak is dead, killed by intruders. ",Classic
45539, You're sure there are only two of them down there? ,Classic
113773, Anybody there? ,Classic
37824," Have the Chameleon aircraft in sight. Am following at ten thousand feet, heading due south.",Classic
3359," Karakorum? That used to be to the north, on the great Steppes.",Classic
154767,"   There's Tuza, and there's a guard. ",Classic
6216, You have studied the Code of the Good Housewife? ,Classic
20022, Well? ,Classic
40184, Really. ,Classic
1574, I can't move it. It won't budge. ,Classic
22661," Yes, my dear. A chance. A slim one.",Classic
99824, Coincidence? I wonder what the Mandragora Helix is up to? ,Classic
46175," All right, Corporal. ",Classic
155174," Because this if off-limits, and I suspect you know it. ",Classic
112371," Goodbye, Doctor. ",Classic
69360," If all goes well, it should set up an electric current in the coil alternating on much the same frequency as the beta rhythms of the human brain. ",Classic
91794, I see. You've changed her body into a battlefield. ,Classic
3559," Doctor, where are you? ",Classic
28970," No, this is no place for gentleman and lads. Go thy way. Go quickly while ye may. ",Classic
72502," The reason why you can't pick it up is that is weighs about seven hundred and fifty tons, at a rough guess. ",Classic
149932," Some people called Kartz and Reimer were having some success, it seems, with experiments in time control. ",Classic
48719, Are you sure you're pushing the right one? ,Classic
73321, Move! ,Classic
110571," Oh, but.     Don't point that thing at me. I am the President, you know. You owe me a little respect. Stun him, K9.   Good dog. Well, don't just stand there, reconnect. ",Classic
33197," He is a friend of mine. He helped bring me here, weak but alive.",Classic
93559, Why? ,Classic
133625, This shield's not going to last much longer. ,Classic
109879, What? ,Classic
103000, Kerril's not here yet. ,Classic
23440, Yes. ,Classic
158161," Oh, hi, Rachel. This is Murray and the Doctor. ",Classic
102611," No. No. Without realising it, they had created life. The computer hadn't failed at all. It had evolved into a living creature, the first of an entirely new species. ",Classic
87297," Er, good luck, Doctor! ",Classic
71255, Doesn't matter. Allen's still guarding the girl? ,Classic
37907," Because if we do find them, we'll find one of these on their arms, eh? And if we remove it, something terrible will happen to you? ",Classic
162942, That's London for you. ,Classic
69664," Well, at least we're rid of the Keller machine, and the Master. ",Classic
96689, Human? Typical Osiran simplicity. ,Classic
370," I don't know. Perhaps he was excited and went off to investigate something as you suggest, but. He may have been taken. ",Classic
146504," I'll be brief. I must be very brief. That is known as a revitalising modulator. It breaks down your molecular structure and puts it back together again. A most refreshing process. Until now, that's the only purpose it's served. I have improvised. It will take you back in time. ",Classic
140061," We must act, and without delay. ",Classic
67880," Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Did you want me? ",Classic
56767, Wait! Open it. I said open it! ,Classic
71907, On the contrary. He'll bring only death and destruction. ,Classic
97483," Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to warn them. ",Classic
57666," Yes, I think so. ",Classic
37892, This is part of the process? ,Classic
67213," Brigade Leader, that technician, the one who went berserk and started killing people, have you found him yet? ",Classic
158303," All right, Doctor. Dan das sochivy. ",Classic
23821," Oh, but we've already searched here, Monsieur, looking for clothes here. ",Classic
158921," So, what you're saying is that before Plato existed, someone had to have the idea of Plato. ",Classic
110260, He always has a plan. ,Classic
70824," Well, after the lizards there were only a few survivors. When the primitives saw how weak we were, they turned on us. They killed my family, my friends, everyone. ",Classic
48296," Miss Jones, I think it's time you went. Come along. ",Classic
32022," Will you both go away. Guard! It's you, badgering him with questions. You've done nothing but hound him ever since you arrived on Vulcan. Bragen's orders were that no one was to be admitted. ",Classic
58920, Useless fools! You'll be punished for this! ,Classic
61021, We don't know till we've tried it. We've never had all the resistance groups together before. ,Classic
157943, We seem to be getting somewhere at last.,Classic
12134," Yes, quite so. We've got to get this thing back in its place. ",Classic
70747, I suppose you're an expert in agriculture? ,Classic
146117," I came to pay my respects to your father, the Professor. A man of great distinction. ",Classic
13533, You demand my secrets? Yield yours. ,Classic
112948, Those engines! ,Classic
157994," Oh, Pex. Move back, quickly. ",Classic
61750," What? No, I thought I might do, but he's a complete stranger. I've never seen him before in my life. ",Classic
54145," Good. Right, get the body up. Jamie, keep a good look out. I think one of those Cybermen is still alive. ",Classic
85784, But I thought you were responsible for that. ,Classic
9560, Well just because an extremist like Robespierre ,Classic
162661," Well, see what you can do, Zbrigniev. All this noise is making me nervous. ",Classic
59866, Silence! Well? ,Classic
132973," Er, I don't think we should go any further. ",Classic
81549, Dragons. They attacked us. ,Classic
88990, Ettis! ,Classic
31244, Ay? ,Classic
156973," So, the target is the asteroid, which at any moment now will reach the solstice and I'm sure that's the deadline. He who dares spins.   Whoops. A supernova.",Classic
94554," Harry, I'm not with you. ",Classic
101324, One of my old pupils at Prydon Academy. ,Classic
20180, The machine flies in the air with a soldier clinging to its back. ,Classic
51852," No. No one at all. Jamie, look! ",Classic
39442," Well, toss it out the window then. ",Classic
73562, Put it down and don't be silly. ,Classic
2746, A machine that can think for itself? ,Classic
36986, No. Get the girl. She can identify you. We can deal with the man later. ,Classic
48385, It's like walking into the lion's den. ,Classic
127587, Finished? ,Classic
149293, Ready? Follow me. ,Classic
131911," Sorry, it's just I'm quite concerned about a couple of friends I left here. I've already seen Tegan, but I'd like to know that the boy Adric is ",Classic
113125, Mister Fibuli! ,Classic
50762," Oh, I'll get the hang of it, Doctor. ",Classic
99950, Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! ,Classic
137658, What? ,Classic
89138," Then this is true, Eckersley? ",Classic
22406," Good morning, my son.   ADalek! ",Classic
64872, No. We know too little about him. ,Classic
126026, Leave at once. Evacuate the Tower. Evacuate. ,Classic
101597, No wonder we couldn't find him. ,Classic
99825, Conquest? Invasion? They want to take over Earth and fill it with old Roman temples ,Classic
38684," No, sir. That is a painting of my wife as a young girl. She is dead now, rest her soul, but Victoria is the image of her.",Classic
62010," That is why we asked you here, General. Our measuring techniques are very accurate but the equipment isn't transportable. ",Classic
122268, It's a pleasure. ,Classic
49213," Well, that depends on how much plastic he used and how far down it went. ",Classic
67344, Word came through this morning. This project is being officially abandoned. ,Classic
54239," No, sir, neither will I. I'll take the full assault platoon with me. ",Classic
58687," I'm on my way home, sir. ",Classic
22405, Great. Keep sawing.,Classic
100346, Doctor! ,Classic
5764, Yes. ,Classic
152902," It is recorded in our folk memory. Before the fire, our ancestors travelled among the stars. ",Classic
97958, I've gone blind. ,Classic
31833, You agreed we'd go and see Bragen. ,Classic
39303," Yes, I know there's danger. You must leave here immediately. ",Classic
51359, Protest? You defy me? You defy a Dominator? ,Classic
71553, Did you tell them who he really was? ,Classic
29182, I do not know this Holy Joe that you keep referring to. ,Classic
110833, Do you know? ,Classic
116145," Well, this station isn't designed for torsional stresses, not like an ocean refinery. ",Classic
126162," Well, if we get out of E-Space, we'll be taking him away from his own universe. ",Classic
67781, Smith. ,Classic
131647, The Doctor has a sonic device which he used to dismantle the energy barrier. He also has an understanding of the gas known as soliton. ,Classic
62120," Miss Shaw, where's that key? You've given it to him. ",Classic
132181," You certainly know how to fly this crate, don't you. ",Classic
139169, What are you doing? ,Classic
57454," Oh, now Jamie, surely ",Classic
23423, Wait until I find the Abbot. ,Classic
9730," I, er, assume from your presence here that you're interested in my proposition. ",Classic
22111," What are you up to? Please, where's Webster? ",Classic
88737," Well, I believe you, Gebek. That's why we've got to expose this Aggedor trickery before they arrive. What is it? ",Classic
36041, We tap and refine gas. ,Classic
44689," You shouldn't have made this trip, Salamander. You're doing too much. ",Classic
102516, The savages have the power to open the barrier. Particle analysis may tell us how they do it. Surely that is why you brought her to us? ,Classic
130444, Nowhere. Vanished. ,Classic
156854, These were fired at no carnival. These were used to enable the Doctor to escape. ,Classic
140929," Big, isn't it?",Classic
128332, The man's a murderer! ,Classic
164463, This is intolerable! ,Classic
5107, Shush. Listen. It's like someone trying to get in. ,Classic
130032," Oh, he's an autocrat, of course, but I now believe a benevolent one. ",Classic
107227," I, I seen it. In my mind. Dark. Great dark. It called me. In my mind it called me. Hungry. It were hungry for my soul. ",Classic
49038, Wait a moment. ,Classic
107656," Yes. Probably at Mrs Tyler's now, eating plum cake off her best china. ",Classic
46747, Right. Come on. What are you waiting for? ,Classic
63396," Don't worry, help's on the way. I only wish it weren't. ",Classic
165221, What I can't understand is what's so special about them. ,Classic
126300, Orientation in the void dangerous without computer assistance. ,Classic
89008, Yes? ,Classic
103390, All motive units closing down. All readings falling to safety. ,Classic
67709," I think you're wrong, Mister Farrel. ",Classic
85050, It must be the one that escaped from the lab. ,Classic
40152, It's all right for you. Have you any idea what it's like in this deadly building? ,Classic
41474," No, I don't think so, Jamie. Yes, just as I thought. Now then.   Jamie, will you hold this flap open for me, please? Thank you. ",Classic
6775, I cannot save him. ,Classic
127005, Then your craft should still be there. ,Classic
49250," Anyway, what are you going to tell them? ",Classic
81925," Yes, what did happen? ",Classic
17948, Close external door. ,Classic
127135, Rapport with the Keeper? ,Classic
36775, Why did not your guards arrest these strangers? ,Classic
106504, I don't know what to think. I've never been inside anybody's head before. ,Classic
47069, I doubt it. ,Classic
127808, In every dimension. I need every detail. The Logopolitans convert that into a precise mathematical model. ,Classic
36675, Where do you suppose they lead? ,Classic
59295, Sentry! ,Classic
84217,   Couldn't wait any longer. Gone to find another way out. Jo. The idiots. Why didn't they wait? ,Classic
136033, Are we on Manussa? ,Classic
123353, The distance between us seems to have lessened again. What went wrong with the experiment? I felt so sorry for you. ,Classic
110017," I believe I've come across it, sir, but I fail to understand any significant meaning. ",Classic
1845," Well that's what we've got to find out. Are they cowards, or are they just against fighting on principle? ",Classic
24437," Doctor, the Commander's fever's gone down, so he's going to be all right. ",Classic
91813," Oh, the absolute minimum, I'd say. But I'm afraid I've something of a shock for you, Vira. ",Classic
142548, Who are you? ,Classic
6056, Does Yetaxa speak with the voice of the gods or as the protector of a handmaiden? ,Classic
147050," Oh, it was nearly at an end anyway. ",Classic
92620," Oh look, Roth, you've got to help me. I came here with two friends and they've both vanished, understand? I mean, you understand? ",Classic
100732," Yes, all right. Yes, Driscoll, I'll contact you in the control room. ",Classic
50743," But why, sir? ",Classic
60635, Keep your eyes on the operations maps! I want to know the moment that capsule arrives in a time zone.,Classic
51310, Yes. If only we could create a diversion for a moment.,Classic
1862, Emergency. Emergency. All Daleks in section three are incapable of working. ,Classic
99298," Yes. It used to be called Keeler. Remember Keeler, your friend? Now do you see what we're up against? ",Classic
21674," Will it work, Doctor? ",Classic
96248," There was a terrible face just for a second, then it was gone. You don't believe me, do you. ",Classic
17062, Shall I show you round? ,Classic
65014," Yes, Benton?",Classic
19607," Yes, well, let's hope the movement doesn't set it off.   He's moving it as if it meant nothing at all. ",Classic
80625," Yeah, I thought it might. ",Classic
60552," Good, good. Now, Moor, give me your gun.   Moor, shoot them! That's an order! ",Classic
151700," May I dispute that? Well, after all, what is time to a time machine? ",Classic
20265," Well, you're not in the war, are you? You're far too young. ",Classic
87505," Right. Well, let's fix the Tardis and clear out. ",Classic
96840," The inner chamber. The control centre of the pyramid. Make the sign of the Eye, Scarman. The sign of the Eye.  (Marcus crosses his arms, palms outwards, uncrosses them and turns his palms down then reaches down and forward. The door opens. ",Classic
88520, No! ,Classic
26076, Uh-oh. ,Classic
163670, One was enough. Never again.,Classic
109119, Mmm. ,Classic
13471," Maybe we could talk to them, make them understand? ",Classic
122881, Three. I have seen three. ,Classic
63199," Well, what about this way, then? ",Classic
48643, I'm sorry. ,Classic
155824," What if instead of bringing their lives to an abrupt end we did the opposite, accelerated the Vervoid life cycle? ",Classic
93462," Out into the wastelands. Do you know a way?   Good. Yes, they are the Daleks. Come on, lead the way. ",Classic
43003," Aye, it's easily said. I'll away and fetch a fresh drink. ",Classic
131058," The state he's in, he could do anything. ",Classic
121246," Yes, but who do you work for? ",Classic
118941, Philosophically. ,Classic
110452," Of course, sir. Peaceful cooperation is a much more fruitful course. ",Classic
127431," Neither do I. Still, what can't be cured must be endured. ",Classic
122364, Who are you? ,Classic
56180, I see. And these must be the secondary electrode accelerators. ,Classic
132623, What? ,Classic
98683, I'll do my best. ,Classic
34138," And then you, then me. ",Classic
40092," See for yourself. Now if the Cybermen didn't shoot him, what did? The answer, I think, lies over here. Jamie? ",Classic
94974," Right, sir. ",Classic
153339, He has none. ,Classic
24392," Doctor, our virologists are willing to give you all the help you need. Can you describe the virus responsible? ",Classic
63789," Liz, I am all right! ",Classic
59948," A young Lieutenant, one of yours. He could have got away, but he stayed behind to help the others escape. ",Classic
114120, Yes. She's the Cailleach.   Run. Come on. Quick. ,Classic
101925," No, no, I hope not, Spandrell. And there's no one in all the galaxies I'd say that about. The quintessence of evil. Goodbye, Spandrell. ",Classic
103670, Shush.   In your cabin. ,Classic
100801," Emergency, emergency. This is not an exercise. Evacuate the complex immediately. ",Classic
44469," If I knew where she was. Oh no, I know she's in the Central European zone, but that's a big place. No, we'll just have to sweat it out and wait. ",Classic
968, Shall I get plates and things? ,Classic
108682," Doctor, come here. ",Classic
161957, Yeah. ,Classic
4786," Ian, try to see. Please. Try to see the truth. ",Classic
127526," He'll destroy you too, Neman, just as he destroyed Kassia. ",Classic
57440," If anything does go wrong, you will be the first to die.",Classic
103471, That's better. Well? ,Classic
114057, Too strong. ,Classic
34079, Nothing on this one either. ,Classic
164243, Of course. ,Classic
53229," Don't underestimate them, Jimmy. They may look like amateurs, but that man has an incredible knack of being one jump ahead of everyone. If there is a safe way into that place, he'll be the one to find it.",Classic
36754, Shh. They might hear you. ,Classic
152334," No, it's all right, I'm okay. ",Classic
77140, Then you will live. Both of you. ,Classic
88793, What else should we do? ,Classic
151541," All right. If anything happens to me, you're to find Peri. ",Classic
4038, Is that what you want to talk to me about? ,Classic
29718," Aye, what for? ",Classic
162986, What can you see? ,Classic
117143," Affirmative, mistress. ",Classic
92432, What does Vira say? ,Classic
81108, Not this side. ,Classic
83653," Good, good. ",Classic
122317, The sonic screwdriver. I must have left it behind. ,Classic
58718," Hey, we need a flint box. ",Classic
84591, You've exactly thirty two and a half minutes. ,Classic
66262," Just a moment, Benton. What's going on? ",Classic
12160," Yes. You've done it, Doctor. There they go. Well, lets hope there aren't any more surprises like that waiting for us. Come on.   Well, come on, Doctor.  Daylight, Doctor! We must be nearly there. ",Classic
125060, I have been constructing the histories of our relationship with the marsh men. ,Classic
121067," Well, all over. Oh, but he's all right. We checked him over. ",Classic
76863, He knows. ,Classic
115724," If they jump us here, we don't stand a chance. ",Classic
29351," So that's your business. I'd know more of this before I drop anchor here, so talk up, man. ",Classic
135128," Anywhere, so as long as it's away from here. ",Classic
127267," Oh no, Kassia. It is only beginning.   ",Classic
117352," This, Princess, is my domain. ",Classic
157028," Doctor, I've got to talk to you. ",Classic
110046, Never! The Doctor is no coward. ,Classic
90709," Look, Brigadier. Look. I think it's starting. ",Classic
77478," Doctor, have you been working all night again? On that? I don't know. What is anyway, a super dematerialisation circuit? ",Classic
39644," Above, liquid metal. Read. ",Classic
2258, Can't we stop them? Can't we do anything? ,Classic
135381, So you're prepared to kill the Doctor? ,Classic
20606," No, no, no, no, no. Keep calm, keep calm. ",Classic
33230, We still have a friend. ,Classic
109251, Is it bad? ,Classic
19076," The success of its mission, by expulsion from the ship, miniaturisation or such lesser penalty as he shall deem fit.",Classic
96390, No. The forces that are being summoned into corporeal existence in that house are more powerful and more dangerous than anything even I have ever encountered. Stay here. ,Classic
112787," Free to think. It's amazing. The city looks so pretty from up here. Yes, even the mines do. You know, that's our entire life. ",Classic
141922, Yes. ,Classic
21445, Perfect. Absolutely perfect! ,Classic
113059," Yes. Yes, I do. You were absorbing what you would call the life force from the plundered planets. ",Classic
4416, He wanted to force you to let him return to Venice. ,Classic
125650, Sounds like a faint engine noise. ,Classic
146553, I don't understand. ,Classic
15841," Oh, yes, Doctor. ",Classic
164199, Wasteful. None of the weapons work. ,Classic
147888, How warm does it have to get before it becomes unfriendly? ,Classic
111343, Then how will I recognise them? ,Classic
40074," He's dead. Don't you see, he's dead? It's this damn building. It's alive. It's watching us! It'll get us all! We've got to leave! ",Classic
94831," My dear Miss Smith, as you remember, my name is Lethbridge Stewart. The clan Stewart. ",Classic
143519, That too. ,Classic
129318," Well, it doesn't amuse me. He promised to get me back to Heathrow. He'll lose me my job. ",Classic
137343, Excuse me. ,Classic
96245, The relative continuum stabiliser failed. ,Classic
108679, A combat situation is escalating. Those idiots have let it get out of hand. It is imperative that I return to the Palace to implement my contingency plans. ,Classic
90771," There is absolutely no question of you leaving, Doctor. Now, you go back to the infirmary, I mean the sick bay, get into bed and stay there until I say that you can get up. ",Classic
160058," You're finished. He's a grass, a dirty stinking grass! He's selling us out to the Daleks! ",Classic
74555, You really mean it?,Classic
106502," Pleasant journey, Doctor.   ",Classic
141459, It'll explode! ,Classic
105615," Come along, there's no cause for alarm. ",Classic
118758," You play with me, eh? Come on. ",Classic
59244," The thing is, where are we? ",Classic
120797," Strange perturbations are in the sky. Oh, I wish I knew how to interpret them. Oh. Now that's very odd. ",Classic
71245," Tomorrow morning, the colonists are going to attack your spaceship. ",Classic
127696, So we don't get to go to Gallifrey. ,Classic
160482, You've got it.   Oi! ,Classic
5158, That thing on your wrist looks valuable. ,Classic
2522, I overheard the two of you. There's something here in the ship and he doesn't want you to tell me. ,Classic
17104," Oh, I enjoyed that. ",Classic
140474, Rescue the Doctor. ,Classic
137835, There has been temporal duplication. ,Classic
66346, Your idea worked. ,Classic
46817, Sir. ,Classic
131236," It's all right, it's all right. Stand firm. Look, it's starting to weaken. Look!   He'll be all right. ",Classic
101845," Now Rassilon found the Eye of Harmony, which balances all things, that they may neither flux nor wither nor change their state in any measure. And he caused the Eye to be brought to the world of Gallifrey wherein he sealed this beneficence with the Great Key. ",Classic
57302," Oh Doctor, hurry! ",Classic
150302," Were they, indeed? I think you may well have done me a great service, Mister Botcherby. ",Classic
144238," Until I walked through that door, I foolishly hoped you'd changed enough for me not to have to do this. ",Classic
124865," Help me find my daughter, I'll help you find your ship. ",Classic
11640," But why, Doctor? Surely they've invaded us? ",Classic
37669, Right. ,Classic
104192," Sounds healthy, but exceedingly dull. Yes, as I was saying, they're a mysterious lot, the Chinese. Enigmatic. I never got anywhere near to understanding them, and I was brought up in China. ",Classic
152193, Not when there isn't a body. Attempting to steal a mannequin can hardly carry a death penalty. ,Classic
13115, Barbara! ,Classic
75729," Leading Telegraphist Bowman, sir. ",Classic
55385," Well, don't worry about him. He's perfectly safe, isn't he? Come on!",Classic
8133, Do you remember us? ,Classic
7723, Now be guided by me in this matter. The one they call the Doctor may not be sincere.  1 ,Classic
134169, It's like having a tooth out under hypnosis. You don't feel a thing. ,Classic
74663, Hmm? ,Classic
147941, You will answer my questions. ,Classic
153708, Show me. ,Classic
60146," And since we have now exceeded the time allotted for this demonstration, I suggest you all continue to your next assignment. ",Classic
94907, Hibernian Control. Number three Ben Nevis rig. Over. ,Classic
152368," Well, it's very good. ",Classic
145362," Yes, I should never have followed those tracks. Curiosity's always been my downfall. How's your rash, by the way? ",Classic
65592, But what about the fuel problem? ,Classic
137873, You will remain in the ship. ,Classic
151084, How do you mean? ,Classic
133786, Just leave! ,Classic
50508," Yes, and better that than setting the whole of Dulkis in a panic. Besides, Cully, I think you should show more respect, if not to me, at least to your father. ",Classic
91348, You must go. The soldiers must go. ,Classic
4066, Well? ,Classic
155531," Giant fruit. And anticipating your next question, we left the fruit on Mogar. We're merely taking the shucks as an example to fellow agronomists in earthbound laboratories. Now, if you'll excuse me. ",Classic
15692," Yes, unfortunately, I'm not used to being subjected to such low temperatures. ",Classic
116199," We've put far too much into this project to abandon it now. There's only one thing to do, that is to find this creature and kill it before it kills us. ",Classic
8319, I agree. ,Classic
30499," Nonsense, nonsense, they'll burn us down in a flash. ",Classic
19166," I said, okay. ",Classic
96554, Splendid. ,Classic
84486, An egg? They've actually got an egg? ,Classic
108489," What do they mean, a steaming? ",Classic
25470," Steven, the key! I've got it! ",Classic
73635," Come on, Anat. ",Classic
114957," Oh, Zadek, always the pessimist. Thank you, Doctor. ",Classic
73485, I know. Wait. ,Classic
92251, I say! ,Classic
17632," They'll think it's a landing place. They'll come in unsuspecting, and then ",Classic
11359, Ashton? ,Classic
160927, To the top. ,Classic
123569, Your appointed tasks in the Experiential Grid are hereby concluded. ,Classic
82537, You will obey the Daleks! ,Classic
96961," Contamination precaution. Money changes hands. In a place like this, it might be necessary to bring in clean currency every few months. ",Classic
118571, All units full alert. Emergency. Emergency. Emergency. Emergency.   Emergency! ,Classic
107748, So? ,Classic
131827, Carried out your instructions. ,Classic
128869," Hmm. Twelve of them at least. War party, maybe. ",Classic
96338," No, no, I'm all right now. ",Classic
60329," Well, is it true? Answer me. ",Classic
147614," Yes, where is it? Look, I'm finding all this a bit disturbing. Cybermen, now Daleks. Time travel in an organ. ",Classic
71448, Bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo. ,Classic
96372," Oh, very impressive. ",Classic
11863," Oh, er, where do they live? ",Classic
8514," Well, at least they know where they're going. ",Classic
31144," Take it easy, love, take it easy. ",Classic
162594," No, my blood and thunder days are long past.",Classic
11330, You wait till you see what they've done to Bedfordshire. ,Classic
81519," Jo, take a look at that one. Well, they're both stunned, just as I was. That's funny. The Ogrons have repaired the airlock door. ",Classic
165121," The dawn of time. The beginning of all beginnings. Two forces only, good and evil. Then chaos. Time is born, matter, space. The universe cries out like a newborn. The forces shatter as the universe explodes outwards. Only echoes remain, and yet somehow, somehow the evil force survives. An intelligence. Pure evil! ",Classic
56726, I've seen what they can do. ,Classic
106134, Contact has been made. ,Classic
88243," Actually, you owe Alpha Centauri a very great deal of gratitude. Without him you'd have been lucky to have got out of there alive. They go in for rough justice here on Peladon, you know. Chop off your head and apologise afterwards. ",Classic
24827, I think I can help you. Clear this main deck. ,Classic
30399, Let's hope they are right. What about Polar base? Are you through? ,Classic
157765, Miracle City!,Classic
31233," I wonder why Earth has chosen to send an Examiner to Vulcan? Just now, I mean. ",Classic
23369, I think he may be telling the truth. I'll come with you. ,Classic
91400," Well, something like that. Anyway, I just wondered. If we could",Classic
84092, Well? ,Classic
128465, Message? What? Now who are you? ,Classic
14577, The woman tied to the horse. Bring her! ,Classic
24613," The sooner they learn to respect us, the better. ",Classic
71162, What is this place? ,Classic
138332," Supposedly cure us, but I rather think they're going to let us die. ",Classic
49404," Now, Leo, I want that laser working as soon as possible. Get on to it at once. ",Classic
97888," What do you mean, the Elixir no longer forms? ",Classic
25459, N-n-n-n-n-n-nowhere! ,Classic
52667," Come on, we must get away. ",Classic
111759, Why? ,Classic
59148," Okay, sir, if you say so. ",Classic
145445, You guys have got one option. You can either stick with me or you can stay here. ,Classic
47019, It can't be! ,Classic
28448," No, Doctor. ",Classic
135609," He serves me in here. If you are capable of doing the same, you will not find me ungrateful. The Ergon will scan you for possible future use. Step forward, girl. It would be unwise to resist.   So, you are known to the Doctor. ",Classic
9879, Ian! ,Classic
9889," And what are we going to see and learn next, Doctor? ",Classic
132358," Not me, you idiot. Each other. Come on, ask me. ",Classic
37046, I think you'll have plenty of opportunity to see someone in authority. ,Classic
80659, What is it? And let's have the truth this time! ,Classic
91448, I see our little problem seems to have grown. Where's Sarah? ,Classic
54966, There is no time to explain! ,Classic
6698," Now, this is not going to be so easy as you think, young man. ",Classic
148498," She's laughing at us, all over the face. ",Classic
78794," Why should it? He will rule for many years, the beloved sovereign of a beloved prosperous people. ",Classic
64498," No, that's impossible. This capsule's been guarded all the time, and you two were here. ",Classic
12816," Yes, what is it, Tavius? ",Classic
83098, This was hidden on the prisoner's body. ,Classic
43763, Far from it. To me you're the most wonderful and marvellous man that's ever dropped out of the skies. Will you do something for me? ,Classic
27726, There's someone behind it! ,Classic
48910, Am I? ,Classic
39163," Introductions in a moment, if you please. First, I'd like to make us a little bit more secure. Kemel, if we lash this bedstead across the door, it might just hold. Rope! That's it. We could do with a chest against it, I'm thinking. Another one on top, ay? Well now, they can't get in and we can't get out. So, where does that put us? Oh. Jamie McCrimmon. I, er, I came to give you this. ",Classic
99335, Why wait? Why not now? ,Classic
145868," Krelper, go and get the cutting gear. Now listen, Doctor. ",Classic
130298," Sir, I must protest! ",Classic
88062," Oh, we've just come from the Earth mission ship. It's all set for take off the moment we get full power. ",Classic
81118, What part? ,Classic
51736, Oh no. ,Classic
18455," Yes, and the Rills won't harm us. They want to help. ",Classic
164999," It's the war, Ace. ",Classic
81139, Disinfected? ,Classic
134935," I'm afraid so.   And so, it would see, is the Master. Come on! ",Classic
155055," Don't hustle me, Mel. ",Classic
75166," Well, to begin with, we must make every effort to make contact with them. ",Classic
135179, I just tried. ,Classic
64620, They mustn't send up a second recovery capsule. ,Classic
50149, Yes. ,Classic
11878," Oh, Grandfather, I belong with you! ",Classic
64916, Conquest? ,Classic
39350, And I will now leave you to your little games. ,Classic
67550, Yes. I'll set up a search straight away. Yates. ,Classic
18126," Well, what are you talking about, Doctor? It's you who stopped to fiddle around on the outside. ",Classic
145660," Very good, sir. ",Classic
21576, If it is. ,Classic
35334, All right. ,Classic
93635," No, Davros. ",Classic
29141," Fetch cloth and water, and a drop of brandy, eh. ",Classic
78554, The same as I would in his position. ,Classic
13200, Sort of. ,Classic
31716, But how? ,Classic
64, See you in the morning. ,Classic
148678," Here we will die, as have so many Governors. The Chief will broadcast first. Anything I say after that will seem like bluster and lies. ",Classic
158228," I'll get you, Weismuller. I'll get you. ",Classic
91220, She's a spy! Deal with her! ,Classic
110775, What does ,Classic
17338," You maybe Headman now, but when the people hear how you treated their enemies, those two will be killed! ",Classic
48469, And my wife? ,Classic
48628," Oh, dear. Where are you going? ",Classic
11370, Why did he do it? ,Classic
3436, My lord is kind. ,Classic
122701," Lord Nimon, are you there? ",Classic
41040, There's something up there. ,Classic
61693, Shoes. Must find my shoes. ,Classic
19309," Well, that proves it's only a rumour. Just like all the other rumours we've been hearing. Look Venussa, you know how far the Ark has travelled and the Earth itself no longer exists, so where could these so-called humans come from? ",Classic
57427, Good! ,Classic
83108, Looks as if all Marat's courage was for nothing. There's no other door. ,Classic
109611, Which way? Which way? ,Classic
78374, We? ,Classic
398, I say tomorrow you will rub your hands together and hold them to the dry sticks and ask Orb to send you fire. And the bears will stay warm in their own skins. ,Classic
47252, I'll get them. ,Classic
20845," Oh, not necessarily, not. ",Classic
144925," No, wait. It's a time of crisis. We must do nothing to threaten the continuity of our people. ",Classic
21349," Oh, come. We need that taranium back, but we can't allow any more people to know the plan. ",Classic
128663, What's the matter? ,Classic
127056, Where did you get these readings? ,Classic
64794," Yes, I know, I heard him. And I didn't believe a word of it. ",Classic
79331," Well, you've been fiddling with it, haven't you? ",Classic
46455, The tin's empty! Evans.,Classic
81924, Occasionally. There was an attempt last month. ,Classic
121342," All ready, Doctor. ",Classic
139009," Yes, but where are we racing to? Where's the finish? ",Classic
60553," Back in there, quick. Moor? Moor, it's me, Russell. ",Classic
26169," Oh, I reckon I do. Well, goodnight sinners. I'm sorry your stay in our fair, law abidin' city has been so, er, rudely disturbed. ",Classic
3267," And with rationing, how long will it last? ",Classic
145114, He doesn't have to. It's still linked with the Master's. It should materialise in the same relationship as the ruin. ,Classic
131608, Nectar. ,Classic
160455, Yes? ,Classic
35452," It had me worried though, I admit that. ",Classic
96806, Same difference. ,Classic
32344, I'll have to check the cable circuit now. Otherwise it's just as you asked for. ,Classic
90006," Hear now, Huarth, most noble of the noble ones, Queen of the eight legs, speaks thus. Arak, male two leg, having attacked field guard Draga, leaving him for dead, the same Arak will now surrender himself.",Classic
115281," Oh, drat. I keep forgetting he's only an android. Doctor, the King seems to be, how shall I say, a trifle more ",Classic
120999," Well, it's worked before, you know. ",Classic
37764," I'm just going off duty, but this gentleman will be pleased to attend to you. ",Classic
140244, The Master will know. ,Classic
62167," Oh, Mister Ransome, would you mind staying here? ",Classic
44982, I should have insisted on going with him. Bruce should have taken me. ,Classic
67361," Now, just a moment, Doctor. ",Classic
11686," Well, it, it would be better if I spoke to someone in charge. ",Classic
119712," Yes, sir. ",Classic
113886," Yeah, something like that. Come on, K9. ",Classic
28912," Sorry Doctor, but we'd better find a station. We can talk on the train. ",Classic
158326," It's almost re-grown. Just another half hour. And then you've got to leave, whether I come back or not. ",Classic
33980," Well, of course. We couldn't send you out there without it. You'd drown. ",Classic
97370," Defiant to the end, Doctor. But you will soon be screaming for mercy and there will be no one here. ",Classic
133753, I haven't much choice. ,Classic
132523, Why what? ,Classic
24969," We'd better play his silly games, Steven. ",Classic
124971, Then Nefred is responsible. ,Classic
110203," Ah, that's Sol Three in Mutter Spiral. ",Classic
151630," Doctor, up here. ",Classic
34520, You can't bide here by yourself. ,Classic
17284," Yes, I think so. I got it. ",Classic
13602," Leader to Spearhead. Lock course on bearing two six five. Speed point oh one. We jettisoned craft at altitude five above Crater of Needles. Individual descent to Sayo plateau, north of the Crater. ",Classic
83961," Yes, yes.   Nobody must go down the mine. Hinks. Nobody must go down the mine. Nobody. ",Classic
162258, Really? ,Classic
151212, Spy? I've only been on this planet a few minutes. ,Classic
69221," Hey, look! It's the UNIT helicopter! Hey! ",Classic
19879," Do not labour this point. I am not Zeus, and this young man is a friend of mine. Neither of us are Trojans, sir. ",Classic
150598, We have no coronic acid. ,Classic
9403, She's here? ,Classic
148988," Yes, that'd be Jack Ward. Over thirty years he's worked for me and in all that time I've never once seen him raise his fist to another man. ",Classic
36427," But would have liked a mask.   This really is remarkable. Most interesting. Yes, I suppose with a little adjustment. Hello, Ben. Don't go. Come in. Don't be afraid. ",Classic
57270, You've only just told me. ,Classic
13296, Classroom. Lecture hall.   How long did you study? ,Classic
25424," Oh! Oh, perhaps you'd better come down, Sergeant. ",Classic
147437," That sounds like another insult, Mister Lytton. ",Classic
17133," Oh, sorry. ",Classic
130204, How do you mean? What point of view could they have? They're savages. ,Classic
74197, Aggedor has shown the way. ,Classic
86910, There's nothing wrong with my mind. ,Classic
54635," Well, it's all quite logical really. Hardly any calculation needed at all. Except for simple stuff like speed, angle of descent and relative positions of the spaceships. ",Classic
65624," Professor Stahlman, as Executive Director of this project, my concern ",Classic
81384," Doctor, what's happening? What's going on? ",Classic
10751," Well, let's wait and see, hmm? ",Classic
28805," Well, it will be like the crossing of two electrical currents. My machine has to face up to Brett's computer, WOTAN. ",Classic
125768, Just vanished into thin air. Poof. ,Classic
38047," Chameleon 345, stand by for start temperature ",Classic
38440," Look, I told you ",Classic
153660, The Doctor is well known for these childish outbursts. I do not find the ramblings of an immature mind offensive. ,Classic
69880, Bill?   ,Classic
1511," Splendid, splendid. ",Classic
90393," You will, Doctor, you will, all in good time, but not until you bring me the crystal you stole from Metebelis. ",Classic
140685," Er, release the Tardis. The computer scanner's located the force field generator. ",Classic
10228," Oh, it's some sort of laboratory. ",Classic
77674, Right!   We've done it! We've done it! We've done it! We've done it! We've done it! We've done it! We've done it! We've done it! We've done it! ,Classic
156524," Yes, you've changed outwardly. But I'm sure you must still have the same sweet nature. ",Classic
88089," Well, he did his duty, now you must do yours. Get that parrinium to where it's needed. ",Classic
154896," Yes. Yes, I am grateful to you, madam, for according me the same privilege as the Valeyard that allowed me access to the Matrix. My excursion will be into the future. ",Classic
87435, It's always carpeted with perfumed flowers. ,Classic
127448," Well, clarity is the soul of knowing what the other chap's going to do. What are you going to do? ",Classic
112722, I mean I will follow them. ,Classic
65310, An hour? ,Classic
134454, Is it you who authorised mass hallucination? ,Classic
43752," Ah, Miss Ferrier, this is Victoria and this is Jamie. ",Classic
28710," Oh, of course he is. He remembers nothing since he was taken over by Brett's computer system. ",Classic
44358," Er, yes. ",Classic
28312," Oh, come along, my man. We're in a hurry. Come along. ",Classic
4250, Thank you. ,Classic
82510," Yes. Well, let's hope we don't encounter one. ",Classic
136905, Steady your mind. Attach to nothing. Let go of your fear. ,Classic
35097, Water.   It's you. The phantom piper!   ,Classic
123475," For twenty years a moratorium was declared on the technique, until I came of age, a thoroughly proficient tachyon engineer. There will be no more disfigured mutants in our next reduplication programme.  There is the future of the Argolins. Where are the guides?   How did he get there? Alert! Alert! ",Classic
76871, We can't get out. The Marshal's sealed us in. ,Classic
151871, Usually. ,Classic
112984, The Doctor would not have instructed me to conduct you to them if he had not thought it safe. Twelve seconds. ,Classic
165290," Are you going to use that gun? You know your problem, Captain Bates? You don't know who the enemy is. A traitor is someone who doesn't know who the enemy is. ",Classic
141516, Sir. ,Classic
92397, Beautiful. Let me know when to switch the power through. ,Classic
115737," Young woman, I'm indifferent. ",Classic
76419, After him! After him! He must be stopped! ,Classic
54850," Now, then, where exactly did we leave it? You two try over there. ",Classic
145040," Come on, we're nearly there. ",Classic
163510," What, those will stop the Destroyer? What, you just shoot the bullets into it? ",Classic
45502, The truck was due there twenty minutes ago. ,Classic
114873," The question is not so much who, my dear, as why. ",Classic
7318," Yes, but they won't agree to that. ",Classic
15358, Curator of a Museum is a better title. ,Classic
32860, The Laird goes too or you can hang me with him. I'll not go with ye. ,Classic
121137," Well, we can try from below the shuttlebay. We'll have to cut our way through. I could put in a request for lasers, have them sent up from Azure. ",Classic
150588, Your plan? ,Classic
7517," Our people are dying, and the First Elder says he senses great knowledge in you. ",Classic
14533," It has a companion, Sir William.",Classic

128967, He's in Castrovalva? ,Classic
29741, We wouldn't stand a chance. ,Classic
72804, Sergeant? ,Classic
160444, Families are very important for people's happiness. ,Classic
54139, Get to the ladder as quickly as you can. ,Classic
40848, He's lying. ,Classic
133950, Cyber fleet dispersed. ,Classic
101030, I hope that regenerator isn't far. ,Classic
15404," Well, we know where it's going, Vicki, we've already seen it. ",Classic
60612," Oh, I think that that's a perfectly horrid idea. ",Classic
162090," Nonsense, we're having a ball here. ",Classic
164581, What's that? ,Classic
114126," No, it isn't. We're standing still. ",Classic

45463," Yes, yes. Now, come along. ",Classic
46955," Yes. All right. So, I'm frightened. Well so would you be if you'd been up there. ",Classic
155329," Gentlemen, is this case to be resolved with a battle of words or to be conducted via the Matrix? ",Classic

33739," Ah, I don't think I want to. ",Classic
133196," Why a bomb and not a missile or some other device, and why these particular caves? There's a reason. ",Classic
50365, It's very strange. ,Classic

35114, Nothing. Absolutely nothing. ,Classic
103869," Emma Buller. And don't deny she was here, cos I saw her with my own eyes. ",Classic
69254, You what? Did it see them? ,Classic
95634, Understood. You've acted correctly. Do not attempt entry. ,Classic
1136," Well, what's going to happen to us? ",Classic
16036, The assassination group will embark at once in our time machine. They pursue the humans through all eternity. They must be destroyed! Exterminate them! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! ,Classic

138529, I don't know.   Look! ,Classic
5973," Poor old souls, they must be bored to tears doing nothing. ",Classic
163546," Oh, the Doctor should do it. ",Classic
156172," With the Doctor as my enemy, I always have the advantage. ",Classic
101920," It's we who should thank you, Doctor, for destroying the Master.",Classic
52332," So far, so good. Some sort of castle. Well, Jamie, now where? Well, you don't have much choice, do you? ",Classic
124205, Closing the city exit. Closing the city exit. ,Classic
141087, Out of the question. ,Classic
52681, Precisely. ,Classic
155997, I agree. ,Classic
19207, Has something gone wrong? ,Classic
159390, I've been here before. ,Classic
128476," We have only to connect this cable from the computer room and the job is done. The aerial's now aligned to the CVE. As you devised the plan, I think the honour should be yours, Doctor. ",Classic
148419," What a wonderful thing a man's mind is. The hallucinatory inductor makes him believe he cannot survive, and soon he will be unable to draw one breath after the next. ",Classic
149940, No! It's unbelievable that they would commit such an atrocity. The use of force is alien to Time Lord nature. ,Classic
119944, Yes. Sorry.   Romana? Romana? Where's Romana? ,Classic
75279," Oh, I see. Look here, old chap, if you're worried, I suggest you go and see the prisoner yourself. ",Classic
121832," Stop him, K9, quickly! ",Classic
21580, I don't think they've quite fathomed us out. ,Classic
41595," Master Abbot, the girl has escaped. She tricked us by feigning sickness. ",Classic
68436, All about what? ,Classic
157069, Doctor! ,Classic
89461," Oh, now I get it!   So, you want me to have a look round and then tell the Brig for you? ",Classic
130599,   I think your guess was right. The Kinda are telepathic. ,Classic
2742, It? It? What do you mean? My machine can't think. ,Classic
145930," Hey, you're the boss. ",Classic
9747," Yes, I know I would. I'm glad you appreciate it. In which capacity would you require me to serve? ",Classic
74023," You have proved yourself worthy to be the new controller. But be warned, the Daleks demand total loyalty from those who serve them. ",Classic
146328," At once. We can't use the transmat, the radiation level is too high. ",Classic
15456, Vicki! ,Classic
15560, The armaments are kept behind locked doors. An impregnable safe. ,Classic
9941, Like something too big for it's frame. ,Classic
71253, Did they say who? ,Classic
72208," Forgive me, but I thought. Well, the costume and the wig, you know? ",Classic
23998," Well, tell me, young man, what made you change your mind? ",Classic
10103," Yes. Rather wide-spread, I'm afraid. ",Classic
59833," Ah, foreigners! Look, what's the use of pretending that Carstairs is wounded? They're bound to find out sooner or later. ",Classic
30361," Well, I think if you allowed us to return where we came from ",Classic
45621," Here, you're not going out there? ",Classic
127039, Melkur? ,Classic
17487," Oh, no, thank you, thank you, indeed. It's very kind of you. I must go. Yes, goodbye. Oh, and, don't worry, don't worry. The Vikings will land south of here, in the Humber. And King Harold will defeat them. Yes, and then in a few weeks time, he loses the battle of Hastings to William the Conqueror. Well, at least that's what the history books said happened. ",Classic
71532, Then you are willing to help us? ,Classic
12412," Good, that's settled. Settled. Fine. ",Classic
143169, If only we knew more about these creatures.,Classic
149562, You must listen. You are making a terrible mistake. I am not your enemy. ,Classic
75071," Where's your radio? The radio, where is it?   Over here? ",Classic
152591, Do you never do anything but kill? ,Classic
143854," I shall work here, on the station. ",Classic
59827, But there's a blank space in the middle. There's nothing marked at all. ,Classic
1667, Susan. ,Classic
132156," And your friends. Please, come in, but first put away your gun.",Classic
152028, Come on.   Daleks. ,Classic
90119," And you, sister? What have you to say? ",Classic
88270," That's what Vega Nexos thought. Saboteurs, agents from Galaxy Five. ",Classic
44784, I'm looking forward to questioning them. I have a feeling they're going to be stubborn. It''s so much more interesting when our prisoners are stubborn.,Classic
159993, So what are we doing? ,Classic
60317, Only two of them and one of those has already been caught. ,Classic
122858," Well, you took your time getting here. Never mind, now you're here you can make yourself useful. ",Classic
91214," All right, I think. They were a bit suspicious to start with, but I found somewhere for you to hide. ",Classic
90686, No. he knew if he went back there he would destroy himself. We'll never see him again.   Doctor! ,Classic
90760," You may be a doctor, but I'm the Doctor. The definite article, you might say. ",Classic
112817, Postpone? ,Classic
130150," Oh, it's quite all right. He needs the atmosphere as much as we do.   Hence the Flora chamber. ",Classic
65087," You all set, Doctor? Lift off fifteen seconds.",Classic
17977, This is a fight to the death for existence itself. ,Classic
114985, Haven't you got anything better to do? ,Classic
118189, Hmm? ,Classic
128649, Me! I'm the trap. I locked the coordinates. Event One! ,Classic
103720," Well that's your problem. I can't be everywhere at once. Toos, open this door for me. ",Classic
139971, An imposter. ,Classic
39307, Can you manage? ,Classic
119549," No, not you. Continue, Doctor. ",Classic
29666, Doctor! ,Classic
103959, Make him talk. ,Classic
63058," No, I bought it a few months after I got the job here. Look Doctor, I'm sorry but I really have to be ",Classic
8046, The Second Elder is dead! ,Classic
92675, So? Earth's cooled down and they've never come back. And Nerva's never been found. It's just a story. ,Classic
71044," But these claw marks. I mean, something made them. ",Classic
37303, Bring him in. ,Classic
38035," Yes, of course, I understand. What have you done with his original? ",Classic
96875," Yes. You know, the Egyptians called him the Typhonian beast. ",Classic
49955, All right. You'd better take that. ,Classic
110943," But I can't, Excellency!   It's impossible! No one could connect to the Matrix without the circlet. ",Classic
106305, Hello. ,Classic
199," You don't understand, so you find excuses. Illusions, indeed? You say you can't fit an enormous building into one of your smaller sitting rooms. ",Classic
40706, Jamie? ,Classic
107849, I don't know. Why did you run? ,Classic
34525, Not another service? ,Classic
163619," Er, exactly how far are you intending to go, Doris? ",Classic
101558," Now, sir? ",Classic
56522," Hello, Earth Control this is Moonbase. Emergency. Emergency. How do you read me? Hello Earth Control, this is Moonbase. Emergency. Can you hear me? ",Classic
119766, Just don't ask. Come on. ,Classic
111033, Vinkelgruber. ,Classic
35423, But you were all killed! ,Classic
87609," We don't need the Daleks. There's nothing they can do that we can't do on our own, sir. ",Classic
119164, What?   ,Classic
163930, The fool! What's it done? ,Classic
98423, The cutaneous creasing is unmistakable. When it's properly thawed out I can confirm it with a cytology test. ,Classic
83409, Very well. ,Classic
24468, Must be. ,Classic
11239," I can, I can. But, well, I'd like you to take care of them for me if you will. I'm not exactly mobile in this thing, am I. ",Classic
127633," Unfortunately for you, you will not be using it. This whole domain is now keyed to my biological rhythms. If you move a muscle, you will be destroyed. ",Classic
125755, Vampires? ,Classic
64884," I tell you, it converts radio impulses into human speech. The aliens in Heldorf's Laboratory were trying to communicate with him. ",Classic
54614," Launch crew clear, sir. ",Classic
131253, Thank you. ,Classic
4326," No, no, no. ",Classic
134413, Altimeters checked. Navigation radios set. ,Classic
86481," The rope, sir. ",Classic
99738, Probably with orange juice on her chin. ,Classic
5740," Yes, yes. ",Classic
141185, It shall be done. ,Classic
23722, The assassins were waiting in the Rue de Place Saint Germain. As we came down the street they fired at him. ,Classic
122761," You stay here. I'll check.   Yes, come on. It's this way. Teka. Teka?   Teka! ",Classic
88961," Gebek, Gebek. ",Classic
119749," One minute would be sufficient for him to go back in time, contact his ship and prevent it exploding. He wouldn't then be splintered in time and all history would be changed. ",Classic
34857, That picture canna be the moon. The moon's way up in the sky. ,Classic
14161, Perhaps I should ride with craftsmen and leave my knights at home. ,Classic
102882," Exactly. If you could keep that exactly that distance away and have it here, the large one would fit inside the small one. ",Classic
2542, Hit where? ,Classic
88679, It was worth a try. ,Classic
97050," Perhaps by error, perhaps by design. ",Classic
75472, What is exactly is it? ,Classic
81951," No. Tell me, Professor, when do you plan to escape? ",Classic
8042, Most extraordinary. He ran away from me! ,Classic
150092, It's Jamie. How did he get here? He should be with me. ,Classic
120968, At our own pace. ,Classic
141888," What, by actions such as we've seen here? ",Classic
39138, I must not be frightened of them. It's just their way. They're different people. Alien. But they will tell me. Of course they will! ,Classic
37356, Can you describe them to me? ,Classic
65485, Right. ,Classic
65012," Oh, thank you. Lethbridge Stewart?",Classic
105420, Listen. ,Classic
19439," Yendom, I do not have to account to you. ",Classic
2439," No, the ship can't crash. It's impossible. Grandfather. Grandfather! ",Classic
25762," We'll never see him again, will we, Doctor? ",Classic
157343," That's it, dear. There's plenty of time. ",Classic
130878, I have voice. They know the prophecy. Now they listen only to me.,Classic
142919, What do you know? What have you seen? ,Classic
50891," Oh, yes, but I don't understand what is happening. Why should these people wish us harm? ",Classic
124333, Start the countdown? ,Classic
51873," No, I won't. I won't give in. ",Classic
59025," And if you see any sign of that Doctor and his friends, you shoot to kill. ",Classic
53005, Jamie! ,Classic
144849, No! No! Doctor! ,Classic
8276, You know where they are?  1 ,Classic
90256, But how did you find out? ,Classic
96148," For a time, but it set up a cycle of chemical change. There's no way back, Sorenson. You've reached the point where your tissues are so monstrously hybridised that the next metabolic change could be the final one. ",Classic
89518,   It helps with the meditation. ,Classic
117947, No. Oh well. Where's he fit in? ,Classic
13159," Oh, Barbara. ",Classic
100116, You only did what you were ordered. What I expected. ,Classic
139247," It is true that Ephemerals, dwellers in time, do have a certain entertainment value. ",Classic
132797," It would also involve passing through the CVE. Now, you can't calculate random coordinates. ",Classic
135734," It's a highly unusual request, Hedin. ",Classic
125974, But what about the guards? ,Classic
29384," Listen, maybe the murderer will come back to the scene of the crime. ",Classic
12154, I'll help you to your bed. ,Classic
80698," Oh, some insignificant electrical matter. Switch on the circuit, my dear.   There you are, you see? It's working perfectly. Nothing wrong there. ",Classic
6655, I nearly was. Who put that stone back? ,Classic
41439," No, no, nothing. ",Classic
64691, Then why didn't Heldorf talk to them? ,Classic
7002, Must get up the other end. ,Classic
130968," It was a prophecy, wasn't it. A prophecy of what would happen here unless ",Classic
46729," Yes, well, we'll try and give it the slip. What did you say? ",Classic
44267, Why? What do you mean? It sounds as if you don't like him. ,Classic
111752, Doping that beast again? Going down that shaft again? ,Classic
64699," Liquid fuel in production, two thousand tons. ",Classic
82871, Walk!,Classic
31164, Open the door! ,Classic
135311, Maxil. The Doctor is secure? ,Classic
43879, Why? ,Classic
91117, Did you believe them? ,Classic
99647, We're heading straight for it. ,Classic
24217, What? Seven hundred years to sculpt one statue? ,Classic
66538," Zero minus ten seconds. Nine. Eight.   Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.   ",Classic
39200," I simply don't know. The only thing I remember is waking up in a bare room with one of those terrible, terrible things. ",Classic
51877, Go in! ,Classic
44511, Yes. He's going to try to get information from them. ,Classic
23854, He is under the protection of the King. ,Classic
76722," Not only have you failed to capture Ky and Miss Grant, you've also let the Doctor escape to Solos. ",Classic
98810, We don't know. Somewhere out there. ,Classic
9694, We agree. ,Classic
22179, I wonder why they chose him? ,Classic
165351," You said I was an emotional cripple, a social misfit. ",Classic
59306, No. ,Classic
55944, What made you think of pouring acid on it? ,Classic
111773," In what way, Highness? ",Classic
72613," Then if we know where he is, why don't we go and find him? ",Classic
46373," Yes, well, I don't think there's any harm in telling you now. I have a craft that travels in time and space. ",Classic
70118," No, I did not. Winser went his own way, poor devil. ",Classic
159969, Stellar? As in stars? You mean he engineered stars? ,Classic
31712," Doctor, what on Earth are you up to? ",Classic
53635," No, but we shall need help. You have a helicopter in the area? ",Classic
56792," Get away from here. Quick, quick! ",Classic
50299, Dead. ,Classic
27995," Well, who knows, my dear. In this strange complex of time and space, anything can happen. Come along, little one. We must go. We mustn't look back.  ",Classic
100178," I'll explain it all, Marco. We'll see to it at once. ",Classic
17622," There you are, my dear fellow. I knew you'd come back. Now, which fires? What are they for? ",Classic
158179," She's all right. Like my little sister, you know. Now, if you don't need me for anything else, I think I'll go wash up for dinner. ",Classic
85553," Oh, come on. What is this place? ",Classic
47166, Is he always as charming as that? ,Classic
10111, He's been shot dead. ,Classic
64592," And Sir James Quinlan, and his immediate staff. Well Doctor, any luck? ",Classic
10046," Be careful, Grandfather. ",Classic
1931, At least we know what to expect. ,Classic
1601," I must, must get out. ",Classic
49474," Have him bought here, under guard if necessary, but get him. I'll be responsible.   Jarvis was right about one thing, Doctor. These Cybermen of yours can't just walk into the Wheel, you know. ",Classic
20701," I'm not going without you, is that clear? ",Classic
120910, Good. ,Classic
109167," I'll take a patrol out, pick him up. ",Classic
68578, And mentally? ,Classic
62115," I agree with you, sir, but it's happened! ",Classic
13107," That's enough. Silence! That was just a sample. There will be more for you, if you carry out the task that I have for you. I want you men to start fires in the hutments next to the circus. The fire will spread quickly. By tonight, all Rome will be ablaze. Kill anyone who tries to stop you. You are acting on orders from Caesar Nero, Emperor of all Rome! ",Classic
143755, What can we do? ,Classic
49941, Maybe so. I still think I'm better by myself. ,Classic
141043," That is why we are here. Have faith, Brigadier. Have I ever led you astray? ",Classic
113238, My colleagues   ,Classic
147905, The Cybermen will not leave Telos. ,Classic
155665," We're being hijacked! If you don't want to get caught, come on! Quickly! ",Classic
111994," Oh, it was nothing. ",Classic
38469," Oh, I know my attitude may appear strange to you on occasions, Kennedy. ",Classic
154299," Ah, good. Hmm. Ah ha. Did you test the endrodyacen? ",Classic
37444," Oh, that's quite enough. Can't you take that fellow into custody? ",Classic
159717, They're my friends. You can meet them later. ,Classic
50165," Well, I think I know just the thing for him. ",Classic
85669, What does she say? ,Classic
22383, Did we sustain damage? ,Classic
30852," Well, when are you going to bring me down? ",Classic
30177," Oh, this is just a normal atmosphere testing probe. ",Classic
5453," Grandfather, do you mean you know? How? Where? ",Classic
63830, Right.,Classic
22124, Doctor! ,Classic
116900," Everything possible is being done. Now Merak, I know you don't agree with my conduct of this war. ",Classic
90594," The moment I have been waiting for. The moment of truth, if you'll forgive a cliché. The moment of truth for us both. You know what you have to do? ",Classic
21156, Cactic outlet? ,Classic
145514, Kill you? Ow! ,Classic
122454," Soldeed, I searched that ship as you ordered, and I found this. ",Classic
25790," Oh, I've got the most ghastly toothache. It's paralysing pain. ",Classic
52441, That's better. ,Classic
59520, Excuse me.,Classic
121204," Oh no, the animals themselves are converted into magnetic signals, and their habitats. ",Classic
157724, We're going down. ,Classic
69377," Yes, thank you, Jo. I'm fine, I'm fine. ",Classic
27272, Did he come out of that laboratory? ,Classic
157576," Scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat.",Classic
82334, Right. Unlock!,Classic
123552, Perfect. What a stabilising matrix. ,Classic
34078, Search the other. ,Classic
20914," Oh, nonsense. You three can take over the spaceship, and I can join you later. ",Classic
13742, I saw thirty or more Zarbi leaving the Crater by the great web. I do not think there will be many more left to guard us. ,Classic
127878," Ah, good morning. ",Classic
158578, Everything ship-shape? ,Classic
110946," For the strong, everything is possible. ",Classic
153812," What are we going to do? If we don't drown to death, we'll be fried.",Classic
113307," The Mentiads must still be approaching. Captain, deal with them.",Classic
107722, You may go. ,Classic
85319," Makes what all the more puzzling? Come on, Brigadier, you can tell me. ",Classic
25267, But you must. It was open before. ,Classic
128793," When the Tardis is on manual, you can't be certain of anything.",Classic
92945, You're here. This is Skaro. ,Classic
38745, Silence! You will reveal nothing to your companion. Obey the Daleks! You are in our power! ,Classic
91613, A drop of brandy'd be the thing now. ,Classic
10172," You say all I want out of the experiment is money, but you want something too, don't you. You want to see it finished, be known as the inventor of it. If the truth came out about Farrow, you can say goodbye to all that. ",Classic
19312," Oh, but it could be true, Dassuk. Oh, don't you remember the story? Hundreds of years ago a doctor and a young couple came and then went away again. Well they were the first people to call this ship the Ark! ",Classic
32109," Well, your imprisonment hasn't been entirely wasted. It's brought your enemy out into the open. ",Classic
3699," Oh, come on Marco, we're friends aren't we? ",Classic
133430, Why? ,Classic
27494," This is a most unusual experiment, Senta. It would not be right to jeopardise the safety of any other members of the city. I will take full responsibility. ",Classic
141911," If my guess is right, that little piece of Silurian gadgetry will more than make up for the lack of a sync operator unless we're able to do something about it. ",Classic
116724, That's very odd. ,Classic
80181, Doctor! ,Classic
82731, Without special treatment it would have spread all over your body. ,Classic
64337," Sir, this just came. ",Classic
29833," Aye, they'd be few in number, I'd say. ",Classic
1458," I don't know. It isn't plastic, I don't think it's nylon either. ",Classic
34919, I'll have you know our Tardis is as sterile as ,Classic
53339," Confusing, isn't it? ",Classic
95044," Oh, yes. ",Classic
151326," It is nice to see you again, Herbert.   Is it always like this, Doctor? ",Classic
26459," Now look, Kate, there's only him and Masterson to handle things if old man Clanton decides to throw anything against 'em, and I gotta get back. ",Classic
127494," Apparently you haven't, Doctor. Consuls, this man is known to me, as is his ambition. ",Classic
112717, They? Who's they? ,Classic
118094, Aren't we forgetting something? ,Classic
39298," But, Doctor Oh, Mollie. ",Classic
127362," Oh, we were attacked. The Lady Nyssa. ",Classic
141510," Excellent, Sauvix. ",Classic
154530, Or perhaps a glass of water? ,Classic
128541, We can't take off without Adric. Doctor! Where's he off to now? ,Classic
165309," War, a game played by politicians. We were just pawns in the game, but the pawns are fighting together now. Eh, comrade? ",Classic
8604," Yes. Cheered Susan up, hasn't it? ",Classic
61573, Of course. ,Classic
127764, No.   Yes. ,Classic
53424," Oh, I see, yes. ",Classic
14875, He hates El Akir. He wants to kill him and take you home. ,Classic
130375," Good. Oh, I know the nonsense she's been filling your head with. Well, answer me this. If the Kinda are so clever, how is it they didn't build their own interplanetary vehicle and come and colonise us?",Classic
132581," Hello? Cranleigh here. Smutty! Now listen, that fellow you sent us. What? What? Well, there was a fellow here. Yes. Won the blessed game for us. First class bat and a demon bowler. ",Classic
83200, A trifle worrying? ,Classic
114229," Now, you understand what you've got to do?",Classic
67640," It's unique, right enough. So, er, you're a magician as well as a Colonel, eh? ",Classic
59355, Thanks. ,Classic
132982, Scott. ,Classic
42986," No, our video links are the only communicators available. Pure sound is no longer in use. ",Classic
57662," Yes, Dervish. But now that you've had a little practice, get those scissor charges laid a bit quicker, eh? ",Classic
45949, AColonel? ,Classic
32068, She's out of her mind. ,Classic
134187," Nyssa, what's the matter? ",Classic
41411," I went for food, now she has disappeared. ",Classic
20716, What key? ,Classic
129192, Shush! ,Classic
63679," We may be able to contain it. The question is, can we cure it? Excuse me. ",Classic
103352," Well, I'm going down too. Just try and hold her steady. ",Classic
74738, The Federation has no jurisdiction over me or over this planet. It is you who will answer for your interference. ,Classic
118763, Scissors. ,Classic
144549, Howard? Am I still dreaming or will someone please tell me where I am? ,Classic
75413," The pleasure of seeing the human race exterminated, Doctor. The human race of which you are so fond. Believe me, that'll be a reward in itself. ",Classic
2294, Alydon and the Thals must be in the city. We must find the control room. ,Classic
32409, Wait. The revolution is not quite over yet. ,Classic
2408," Well, let me look at it. ",Classic
132303, Thank you. I'll have the same. ,Classic
2622, But he has fainted. Look at him. ,Classic
49304," Probably, but don't strain to remember. Concussion can bring about temporary lapses in memory. There is quite a lot we don't know about the memory bank yet, you know. Good. I suppose the part that you can't remember is why you told Jamie to protect the rocket. ",Classic
129183, But there is a real Castrovalva. It's mentioned in the Tardis databank. ,Classic
62778," Well, it's a possibility. I suppose. ",Classic
99903, Do you know what it is you're mocking? Do you know what power is held by the celestial bodies? They are not at our beck and call. ,Classic
8469, What on Earth are you doing here? ,Classic
117416, Could be the result of biological warfare? ,Classic
138594, It doesn't matter. In a couple of hours there won't even be a Terminus or a Company or anything. I found some information in a computer. ,Classic
45664," Oh, is he safe? ",Classic
77806, What on earth is going on? ,Classic
14367," It would be of little use, a player king and a young woman, sire. ",Classic
82792," They discovered it by studying the Spiridons. It's an anti-reflecting light wave. Their problem is that to create the energy required, they have to generate fantastic power, so they can't sustain it for very long. ",Classic
24495, You mean of the humanoids like yourself. ,Classic
164361," Merely sugars, proteins and amino acids. But it will soon start to evolve again, so I'm going to stop the change here. All organic life will be eradicated in the firestorm. And when this world is destroyed, no more change, no more evolution, no more life. No more amendments to my catalogue. ",Classic
63423, Then we shall destroy them all.,Classic
136715," Oh. Oh yes. In honour of the special esteem, esteem ",Classic
129825, There is a galactic legend about a Rassilon. He who found the Eye of Harmony. ,Classic
115404," While Grendel still thinks we're in the Palace, we may be able to surprise him. You must bring up a troop of bowmen under cover of darkness and position them on the left flank, here.   Doctor! ",Classic
24124, You were right. It is an alarm. They've found the Tardis. I can't say I like the look of them. ,Classic
29029," Oh, okay. Well, it's a nice old pub anyway, isn't it. Yeah, and I'll bet the beer's better than they serve nowadays. ",Classic
31618," Lesterson, this is a special enquiry. Now please. ",Classic
115224," I understand, Doctor. Come, Count. We must allow His Majesty to rest. ",Classic
94115," Yes, we used to leave them where they dropped. ",Classic
124588, Time to start up the siren.   Still no sign of Decider Draith. ,Classic
68043," That will do, Captain Yates! May I remind you that you're duty officer today. If you're ready, Doctor? ",Classic
65086, Final check completed. All systems now go. ,Classic
122925," Come on, Doctor. Hurry up. ",Classic
160438, We're going to escape. ,Classic
14788, No! ,Classic
56014, Who's there? ,Classic
38464," That's them, yeah. Yeah, definite. ",Classic
138451," Yes, you're right about the sickness. I want to find out what he discovered. ",Classic
28557," Where is he? You are responsible for the stranger, where is he? Do you know what has happened to him? Answer. ",Classic
81347," Well, it's just a space ship, Jo. You know, I reckon we must be somewhere in the twenty sixth century. Well, interstellar travel's pretty routine by now. ",Classic
28537," Oh that. And you're looking forward to it, eh? ",Classic
10637," Come on, open the doors. ",Classic
23485, Thanks. ,Classic
111154," At full capacity, Excellency, just as you ordered. ",Classic
112240," Yes, exactly. You know how attached I am to that piece of jethrik.   Ah, do I hear the chink of the Graff's gold? ",Classic
82076, Doctor! ,Classic
130130," Doctor, what about you? ",Classic
7864," Oh, yes, that's a cure all right, but then why cure something when we can stamp it out, hmm? ",Classic
10298, I want to have a look. ,Classic
135485," All is in order, Castellan. ",Classic
55189, Because I particularly want you to give her those pills the moment she wakes up. ,Classic
49067," Female? Look, I'll have you know this is a kilt. Have you not seen it before? ",Classic
27208, What goes on down there anyway? Is it a sort of hospital? ,Classic
129632, Must you make that awful noise? ,Classic
155658," Rudge, I will personally see to it that you rot in jail. ",Classic
46587," Always questioning! Even now, you're seeking to destroy me. I see I shall have to guide your thoughts. ",Classic
44142," See the point is that I'm near enough to him to pick out something. This was the first time I met Salamander. I must say that you were right about him, Astrid. We must get rid of him. He must be stopped. ",Classic
134060," Er, tell the, er, Doctor, would you, please? ",Classic
21662, What news of our force? ,Classic
38129, Yes. ,Classic
66691, I think we've seen enough of this nonsense. Come on. ,Classic
102630, No! ,Classic
137809, Stop! ,Classic
74770," You don't really think that our appearance on the planet of Peladon at this precise crisis in their history was just coincidence, do you? ",Classic
85327," That's fine, so long as no one steals the basket.",Classic
120300, Affirmative. ,Classic
121115," Oh, yes. ",Classic
9908, What? ,Classic
164197," How long have I been asleep, and why have I naturalised in this form? ",Classic
45379, Hello? Hello? Hello? ,Classic
113449," More power, Captain. More power! ",Classic
19306, Human beings! ,Classic
48079," This is a struggle for power, Miss Jones. Matter over mind. I'm convinced all these people Mrs Harris, Chief Robson, Mister Van Lutyens, have all been overcome in this struggle and goodness knows how many more people. ",Classic
157042, She's not the only one with a sting in her tail. ,Classic
100436," Gallifrey? No, I've not heard of it. Perhaps it's in Ireland. ",Classic
53548, I think the guards are still out there. ,Classic
133661, Fondness? I'm surprised your emotionless brain understands the word. ,Classic
148674, The wish to see all the cells of his body destroyed. ,Classic
89631," This is only the first stage, do you see? ",Classic
140325, Indeed. ,Classic
154275, Never! ,Classic
163185, Winifred isn't following. ,Classic
123810," Within your limited frame of reference, yes. Now, if you will be so kind as to proceed.   General Grugger, have I explained the procedure sufficiently? ",Classic
96059," Oh, everything. He's brilliant. ",Classic
5047, Who are you? What interest have you in the keys? ,Classic
130809, No! I don't want to play. ,Classic
159988, Just one thing. ,Classic
30337," Well, that pretty soon we shall be having visitors. ",Classic
97287, Harry and Benton and the rest are not the real thing. ,Classic
126373," No, the other way round. ",Classic
7490, Well I don't like this splitting up. ,Classic
4535, And I was going to paddle in it. ,Classic
32392, Exterminate! ,Classic
7878," I return your greeting, Scientist. ",Classic
74716, Centauri. ,Classic
34105," Well, two can play at that game. Have you ever seen this? ",Classic
46998, The Doctor! ,Classic
157368," Well, we'll be looking out for you, dear. ",Classic
87883," Yes, they must drain their electrical energy from the atmosphere, probably via that beacon. ",Classic
32696," Kirsty, get away, will you. ",Classic
93050," Come on, we're wasting time. ",Classic
131875, I think he's asleep. ,Classic
101789," If heroes don't exist, it is necessary to invent them. Good for public morale. ",Classic
101352," We checked the tower, Castellan. Nothing. ",Classic
6749, How shall it be done? ,Classic
78853," I'm afraid he's dead, Jo. The crystal! It's the crystal of Kronos!   There you, Jo. That's what all the fuss has been about. ",Classic
79518, Oh. ,Classic
919, What are you doing? ,Classic
99726, What was there? My death? ,Classic
28161, Thank you. ,Classic
165059, I hope we're not too late.   Oh no! ,Classic
159806," I have no idea. Not my department. Now, Doctor, since you hold my career in your hands, I trust you can justify my faith. ",Classic
114882," Ahem, you're standing on my scarf. ",Classic
130539, I see. Wait! ,Classic
127310, No need. They're under lock and key. ,Classic
12705," Maximus Pettulian from Corinth has arrived, sire, and with a small girl. He requests an audience with Caesar Nero. ",Classic
42820, Pity that he turned traitor. ,Classic
52841, Must have the wrong house. ,Classic
74423, But it was there. I saw him. ,Classic
154404," Oh, really? And does any of your sudden and convenient recall agree with anything that the court has already seen? ",Classic
112129," No, no, come on. I'm thinking of myself as well. ",Classic
137231," Well, who are you? ",Classic
87156," He's causing the emergency! You've got to stop him, put him under arrest. We can raid that place with your men. ",Classic
11225," Oh, I wish the Doctor were here. ",Classic
148911," Well, that's as may be, but is thy name on the list? ",Classic
119674," Only Nor-norwest. Nobody's perfect. If you think I'm mad because I say I met Shakespeare, where do you think your precious Count got that? ",Classic
147958, He's been captured by the Cybermen. ,Classic
61774," Oh, him? No, he didn't tell me anything. He came in with the rest of you. I thought he was one of you lot. ",Classic
11281, What? ,Classic
136343, Face me. ,Classic
160956, Crystallised syrup. As it ages it becomes unstable. ,Classic
132190," Oh, that would have happened if we'd been there or not. All part of Earth's history. ",Classic
63391, I came here to warn you that humans are about to enter your caves. ,Classic
82501, Doesn't it strike you as being a bit too convenient? ,Classic
105722, That is what I said. ,Classic
62065," Yes, it would take far too long to try and explain that to you. The important thing is that we've got to get this material analysed. ",Classic
149881, It threatened the Time Lords. ,Classic
84702," Captain Yates, the Doctor here. Now look, I'm going to have a stab at getting in there myself.",Classic
36780," Yes, I do, urgently. Come with me. ",Classic
97945, You make Condo fool. Now you die. ,Classic
119436, Surviving. The prime motive of all species. We were not all destroyed. A few of us escaped in a crippled spacecraft and made planetfall in this world in its primeval time. We found it uninhabitable. ,Classic

149854," No, it was just a suggestion. ",Classic
83861, Come in.,Classic
19078, I call on Baccu to detail the charge. ,Classic
23844, Perhaps he went away somewhere with the apothecary who used to live here? ,Classic
71298, I'll leave them to you. ,Classic
68485," Yet all the indications are that he was attacked by a hoard of them, and the shock killed him. ",Classic
159195," Have the girl. Special closing down sale, you might call it. ",Classic
13536," The great secrets you speak of in your ship must be used against the invaders. In return, I offer you your freedom. ",Classic
164939, Oh no! You should have told me. ,Classic
72832," I'm sorry, ma'am. Would you please do as you're told. ",Classic
64317, I can't answer any questions. ,Classic
162852, Kill them! Kill them now.   ,Classic
24102, A strange report from the jungle. The Monoids acquaint us of intruders. ,Classic
50410," And this island was used to test an explosive device, the results of which can be seen today. Thereafter all further research into this type of energy was prohibited, and the island was kept as both a museum and warning for future generations. ",Classic
139452," I don't know, but it's increasing. ",Classic
52677, We have no wish to destroy them. Merely adjust their minds to suit our purpose. ,Classic
132473, Lord Cranleigh. ,Classic
35274, What is it? ,Classic
73059," Are you all right, Jo? ",Classic
94938, How very curious.,Classic
18056, Hmm?,Classic
97797, What was that? ,Classic
85778, A man from the stars? ,Classic
96266," I'm sorry, sir, but the gentleman insisted. ",Classic
94739," I think, therefore it missed. ",Classic
114085," Ogri, Ogri, you shall do my bidding. Do you hear, Ogri? Do you hear? ",Classic
100257, It is well. The hour approaches fast. ,Classic
118397, Obey. ,Classic

67975, Would you like us to come back another time? ,Classic
103972," AEuropean body as I understand them, sir. ",Classic
96360," Ah. Splendid. An excellent year. One of my favourites. Yes. I really must congratulate you, Mister Scarman. ",Classic
164029," I perceive you are a sick man, sir. Divine retribution for your blasphemy, perhaps? ",Classic
102463, What are their origins? ,Classic
127011, I don't understand what's going on. ,Classic
164967, I've seen it. How good are your parish records? ,Classic
121052, Yes. ,Classic
48082, You mean the creatures have taken over human beings? ,Classic
29749," Yes, and it's going to give us enough time for Blake to come back here, and the same time to save the people in this village. ",Classic
97833, We must get the Doctor back. We must! ,Classic
132138, The Terileptil base. ,Classic
70944," How very formal. Well, shall we go? ",Classic
58707," You don't happen to remember where the light switch is, do you Milo? ",Classic
56432," There's one minute to go. Now hold tight, everyone. ",Classic
137989," Oh, you're so typical of your planet, reduced to shouting if you can't have your own way. ",Classic
127913, Absolutely. ,Classic
124104, Central Control to Deedrix. Central Control to Deedrix. Power drain is reaching critical. ,Classic

68778," All right, keep looking. Yes, let me know as soon as you hear anything. ",Classic
121700, Whereas bureaucratic murder is rewarded with promotion. ,Classic
119083, Do you mean an alien's trying to steal the Mona Lisa? ,Classic
105016, It's a laser beam. ,Classic
143931, We obey. ,Classic
31699, You attack the Examiner in the mercury swamp and blame it on the rebels. Then you sabotage the radio and blame that on the rebels too. ,Classic
10418, What about human beings? ,Classic
11485," Yes, all right.   There's a tunnel through here. ",Classic
94001," No. No, it's simply that there are so many things which might go wrong. ",Classic
69797, Sir. Sergeant? ,Classic
59842," Oh, very well. Doctor John Smith.  LÜ ",Classic
76840," Exactly. Fire the grenades.   Pull out! Everyone out of the cave.     All sections, seal off exits. Fire grenades.",Classic
96017, The pathology readout is identical to the others. Total dehydration. Even the bone marrow. ,Classic
69957," On the contrary, I have every right. You're all under security arrest under the Emergency Powers Act. ",Classic
84351, I think I can see something. ,Classic
128221, Who from? ,Classic
64657, Are you coming? ,Classic
12996, I'll come back for you somehow! ,Classic
103502," Yes. Oh, come on. Don't be upset. Yes, you failed, you failed, but congratulations. Failure's one of the basic freedoms. Listen. Do you think that looks a likely place? ",Classic
113576," Better than Calufrax, I hope. ",Classic
102452, Now we shall be one. ,Classic
137519, I am the Doctor. Dematerialise immediately. Time is running out. We must leave this place at once. ,Classic

130021, The boy Adric cannot fail to be with me now. ,Classic

82942," A tiny motor with an electric power source. That's it. Yes. Yes, I'll dismantle the circuitry, reverse the polarity and convert to a low power receiver transmitter with a positive feedback. ",Classic
94963," And then what, Harry? Keep trying. I'm going to call the Doctor.",Classic
4687, Your royal highness is most gracious. Perhaps if your majesty will stop hogging the grapes we can all have some. ,Classic
29366, Captain? ,Classic
20448, He must be able to see he's got nothing to worry about. That thing is so rickety it must be full of peep holes. ,Classic
162017," Yes, we used to have a great time in the old days, going from planet to planet. But we've really got settled in here since ",Classic
68058, Is anybody there?,Classic
67911," Doctor, where are you going? ",Classic

35834, Is this still switched off? ,Classic
158689, Treasure? ,Classic
146706, Until your work is done. ,Classic
1440, Well how is that going to help us? ,Classic

3432," I am ready, Susan. ",Classic
47709," Dwaas. He's cracking up, Harris. ",Classic
46957, Yes. ,Classic
59843, Good. Now we are getting somewhere. What are you doing behind our lines? ,Classic
52803," Come on, there's only one company. ",Classic
79420, I am prepared to take that risk. ,Classic
119657, That was clumsy of you. ,Classic
145565, In that case you will appreciate what a masterpiece my facsimile of Salateen is. The perfect android. ,Classic
51856," Oh Jamie, it's gone. ",Classic
144962, I wonder if Logar will help a sick Time Lord. Perhaps the Master needs the blue flame more than the people of Sarn. ,Classic
148297," Peri, pull his away from the wall. ",Classic
145224," Should be the droids. Come on, belt plates. ",Classic
73668, We will reach the targets on the next work period. ,Classic

8770," You keep on saying that. I just want to know, that's all. ",Classic
122076, Seth. ,Classic
88893," Yes, Doctor. Ortron and I are agreed. From the death of the first hostage, it will be war. ",Classic

95910, There is nothing to be done. ,Classic
10889," Oh, that's bad, that's very bad. We could have done with those two men. ",Classic
140213, It's cunning of you to confirm the superstitions put about by the monks. ,Classic
79350," Now, what's a bridge for, eh? ",Classic
150916, As surely as they know the punishment that awaits their failure. ,Classic
85490, A man in armour? ,Classic
62621, Check. ,Classic
101644, No. ,Classic

88332, Your Majesty. ,Classic
140075," To set the Barons of Britain against him, to provoke a great rebellion and topple him from the throne. ",Classic
122577, Some kind of machine. ,Classic
130660," I was forgetting. We haven't been introduced, have we. I was also forgetting you don't speak, do you. I'm not surprised you look so sad. Telepathy is a very boring way to communicate.   Such a strange creature.   Something to say.   You are unhappy. Very unhappy. Perhaps I can help you free your brother from the dome. Would you like that? I thought you might. With my help, you could launch an attack, destroy the people who've held your brother prisoner. Yes, you're right. The people in the dome are evil. With my help, Aris, you could become all-powerful. I am the Mara!  Do not resist. I am your strength! ",Classic
126154, In full flight? ,Classic
85776, There was a strange looking knight with Irongron. ,Classic

102736, Destroy and be free. Destroy and be free. ,Classic
16885, Like what? ,Classic
20129," Yes, it's quite refreshing. It seems there's a man lurking behind that flaccid facade after all. ",Classic

121037, In the crystal. ,Classic
40895, Finding them? Finding what? ,Classic

2392," Oh, how stupid of me. I very nearly forgot my specimens. Oh, your hand, sir.   Goodbye. ",Classic
46894," We can't do anything until we get back to Headquarters, and then, if we've got time, we'll try and increase the range of the control units. ",Classic
35544, Polly. I thought that I told you to stay behind. ,Classic
18672, And the Chumbley outside my Tardis? ,Classic
67467," Good morning, Miss Grant. ",Classic
13352," Yes, it's curious. Yes, yes, yes, but we must find something more tangible, hmm? Come along, come along. ",Classic
114858, Master. ,Classic
138070, Follow them. ,Classic

163205," Stop Merlin? No, I will deal with Merlin in my own manner. ",Classic
3384," Barbara may have told you that we're leaving here tomorrow, so get all the rest you can today. You may use your caravan again, but before we leave in the morning, it will be locked and the key handed over to me. ",Classic
122020, Only? Can you fix them? ,Classic
92287," Well, something must have happened to them.",Classic
127701," While I do that, dear, I wonder if you'd mind shutting the front door.   And don't forget your bag. You might need it. ",Classic
123189, I'd like you both to take another look at those experiments. ,Classic
44972, I told you to let me know when Salamander was out of Records. ,Classic
21301, And the Doctor. ,Classic
140500, Ah. Why me? ,Classic
151779, Ah? Not like you to pass up the opportunity to boast. What is it? ,Classic
77904," I've been a bit lonely, but that's all. ",Classic

44110, Jamie. Jamie! ,Classic

67397," Now listen, Mister. Get off my pitch while you're still safe!.",Classic
9530," I understand that Barrass is leaving Paris tonight. I assume it must be for a meeting. With the position as it is, it can be for no other reason. I want to know who with, and the decision. Given that, I can still defeat my enemies. ",Classic
77675," Now, I put it somewhere in that sector there. Anything between fifty and a hundred miles from here. ",Classic
81120," Oh, you mean the trizon? Yes, it's here. ",Classic
121044," Oh, yes, but ",Classic
71206, Why were they after you? ,Classic
142789, It smells lethal. ,Classic
127141," No, that is not intended. ",Classic
160588," The foam can be diverted down another pipe, but I'm not going to tell you how. Anyway, it's a hypothetical question. What reason could I possibly have for stopping an execution? ",Classic
25532, We've got to find the next clue. Now there isn't even a telephone here. It must be in here somewhere. ,Classic
127182," Its limitless organising capacity refined to a single frame and obedient to the will of your Keeper. A great achievement, Tremas, and a great temptation to people less principled than ourselves. ",Classic

67922, I was admiring the workmanship. ,Classic
103794, How could mere humans destroy a robot? They're unarmed. Weak creatures of flesh and blood. ,Classic
160617," No, you're not. You're a killer. ",Classic
84676, Giant maggots? What kind of insects are they going to turn into? ,Classic
69445," Excuse me, sir? ",Classic
7831," Thank goodness. Ian. Ian, you're going to be all right. ",Classic
59587," I'm sorry, Doctor, but it seemed the only way. ",Classic
153618, The wild ones. We're too late! ,Classic
152634, Doctor? No. ,Classic
101783," The story is not acceptable. This is a very difficult, very delicate position. We must adjust the truth. ",Classic

117614, Probability is for maximum three point two five minutes. ,Classic
144480, I don't know. ,Classic
22698," Yes, it's vaguely familiar. It might be Kembel. Do you know that means that that directional unit must have burned itself out after we'd dematerialised. I wonder if you'd bring that er, that impulse compass. ",Classic
162142," Just think of all those tickets we've sold. Does that make you feel good? It wasn't always like this, was it. Not before we came to this dreadful place. We used to have fun. We were free spirits then. ",Classic
34142," You're too new. Get out of my way.   You, you. ",Classic
139687," Now, open that door. ",Classic
117543, Assimilating information. ,Classic
159228, Place it in the circuit. ,Classic

154657, You have blundered! You have reduced the greatest business brain in this part of the galaxy to catcher of sea snakes. ,Classic
30883, Check. ,Classic
132651, Sir Robert? ,Classic
126784," And you and I, K9, are going to Biroc free them. That's something we've got to do, don't you think? ",Classic
68610," Venusian Karate. I think you'll find that a lot harder than you imagine, young man. ",Classic
111323," Well hidden then, I hope, sir. ",Classic
22966," Wait, Steven. We can't just leave him. ",Classic
121668, What about the excisemen? ,Classic
1475, Shh. He's coming. ,Classic
56196, I see. So you lost government backing? ,Classic

47761, You speak for yourself. I'd rather ,Classic
161815," So this is Segonax. Not quite the green and pleasant land we'd been led to expect. Still, I've had good reports of the friendliness of the natives. ",Classic
78920," The point is academic, Doctor. In a few moments, it'll be of no further interest to you. ",Classic
152346," Well, thanks for showing me the way. ",Classic
8205," Thank you, sir. ",Classic
26980," Thank you, Doctor. We like to think that we have created here something of lasting value. ",Classic

111999, What? ,Classic
92837," Why you stinking, lousy swine, Vural! You tried to do a deal with this thing? ",Classic
91973," Yes. No! No, the plan is changed. Hear me, hear me, the plan is changed. ",Classic
12147," Well, surely it's worth a try? You wouldn't be any worse off than you are now. ",Classic
71890," There will be trouble about those colonists, you know. ",Classic
69143, They seem to be setting up some kind of search party. ,Classic
165636," Oh, do shut up. This planet's disintegrating. According to my calculations, the safest place at the moment is over there. ",Classic
113938, Good. I want you to check the stone circle again. ,Classic
117749," Yes, yes, everything's perfectly all right. Everything's wonderful, isn't it, Astra? ",Classic

27831, You must not harm Jano. ,Classic
21535, The beings appear to be invisible. We must continue the search for the fugitives. Keep constant detector readings. Open fire when it registers close proximity. ,Classic

162763, Why outside? ,Classic
42625," Well, I'll try and help you, but I do think you might try trusting human beings instead of computers. ",Classic
94519, I'm getting a bit old for this sort of thing. ,Classic
17779," You know we can't do that, my child, not until we stop this time meddler. Have either of you got a pencil and paper on you? ",Classic
2473," Where is not as important as why, young man. I must go and check the fault locator again. ",Classic
111348, K9 is a mere machine. ,Classic

21741," Once we have the taranium, there is nothing to stop us! ",Classic
30761," Oh, as it comes. ",Classic
158807," I haven't got no mum and dad. I've never had no mum and dad and I don't want no mum and dad. It's just me, all right? ",Classic
39185, However it isn't wise to make assumptions.   Nor to meddle in affairs which are none of your business. ,Classic

118141," My congratulations to you, Doctor. ",Classic
58989, Milo wasn't anywhere near the controls when it all happened. ,Classic

27170," Something very strange has happened, Senta. We have one of the outsiders, but she does not submit. She is fighting. ",Classic
54962, What is happening? Who are these people? ,Classic
100159," What have you done with the Count, sorcerer? ",Classic
68608, I'm telling you I'm not leaving. ,Classic

52438, Have mercy. ,Classic
61413, We're perfectly safe in the Tardis. ,Classic
4624, I see. And in that case it was possible to eliminate evil from the minds of men for all time. ,Classic
139958, I like not this man. ,Classic
76872, What are we going to do?   ,Classic
86081," I'm in no great hurry, I assure you. ",Classic
75937, Suppose they won't listen to you? ,Classic
89548," Well, at least have a cup of tea. ",Classic

66508, All systems have been checked and are functional. ,Classic
163831, Darwin's theories. They turned nineteenth century science on it's head. ,Classic

I, who was once, once comely, who was always a lover of beauty. And now I have to live in this exile. I have to live amongst androids because androids do not see as we see. ",Classic
10636," Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go and have a look. ",Classic
156169, What puzzles me is why it's happening now. ,Classic
160290, A horned dinosaur with a mouth like a beak? The Brigadier saw one in the London Underground once. ,Classic
22138, Your guess is as good as mine. Let's hope we never land there again. ,Classic
129662, Or maybe Tegan's right. Why do it? ,Classic
55872," Oh, I see. And you set the machine's systems to educate the Gonds up to the standard you require. ",Classic

83735, More muck! More devastation! More death! ,Classic
10907, Forward. ,Classic
142178, I'm known as the Doctor. ,Classic
109562," Yes, it certainly seems like it. ",Classic
135533," It's ready, Nyssa. The Doctor? ",Classic
122891, You fools. You are all doomed. Doomed. ,Classic
51232," Well, you can't. The terminal at the survey unit was destroyed, wasn't it. ",Classic
7314, Are you two feeling better now? ,Classic
117386," There must be some evidence this way. Anyway, it's time I found the other two.   Come on. I'll tell you about the theory of particle transmission. ",Classic
101756," Come on, come on. Show me. ",Classic
91707," I say, what a place for a mortuary.",Classic

144207, Why Earth? ,Classic
123882," Well, that's easy. Just waggle his tail. ",Classic
117040," Ah, Marshal. I understand you've got a few problems and I was thinking that if you and I got together we, er, Marshal? Marshal? Is he all right? ",Classic
81338," Terrific, but what do we do now? ",Classic
6657," Oh, so he followed me, eh? ",Classic
141420, Ready. ,Classic
141625, What about the Silurians? What if they manage to break in? ,Classic
72582," Precisely, only far, far older and immeasurably more dangerous.",Classic
149992, Do�a Arana had little interest in food. Her mind was full of her religion. ,Classic
86981, What do you mean? ,Classic
116966, Yes. Is there any other reason why the Marshal would want to get rid of her? ,Classic
13311," From Nero? But it couldn't have been, we ",Classic
142322, Never more so. ,Classic
93776,   What? ,Classic
107370, Then with your mind. Did it have a human shape? ,Classic
141448, We are ready to enter. ,Classic
32923, What? ,Classic
42026," Thank you. Don't worry, everything will be all right. When it's all over you can come back. I hope.   Now don't forget. I will go into the sanctum first and deal with Padmasambhava. And, as soon as it's safe, make for the curtain behind the throne. That's where the control room is. ",Classic
100132," Count Federico, can't you understand? I'm not interested in your political ambitions. Your enemies are not here in this dungeon. They're in the temple. It isn't Giuliano you have to fear, it's Hieronymous. ",Classic
27682," One of? Yes, yes of course. I'm afraid I'm not quite myself. ",Classic
57956," But it just might, Jamie. Supposing I could step up the electromagnetic power enough to bridge the space between this section and the next. ",Classic
70508, Are you are sure the Master knows? ,Classic
112900," Oh, he's just a terrible old bully. All that by the evil nose of the sky demon nonsense is just bluster. ",Classic
42414," Yes, I realise that, and I'm sorry. ",Classic
15244," Oh, so I have. ",Classic
138860, Wood. We're in a building. ,Classic
56111," So, there is no means to communicate with Earth? ",Classic
142371," Oh, you know I don't. ",Classic
15527," So then what happened, after the Moroks had captured the planet?",Classic
59118," Now, somewhere near that neuristor bank, there should be the implanted overriding unit. It's probably transistorised. Very small. ",Classic
146557," But it's murder! Why, Noma, why? ",Classic
75730," Jolly good. Er, nothing very elaborate, my dear. Just eggs, bacon, toast, coffee. Oh, and a little rough-cut marmalade, if they've got it. How long is he likely to be? Captain Hart, I mean. ",Classic
69972," I only hope you're right, Jo. ",Classic
78775, They speak of the sacred mysteries. ,Classic
33063," Whoever was entrusted with this standard stood closest to the councils of the Prince, you would agree? He would also know where the Prince was most likely to run to. ",Classic
70009, But don't you see? It's the simplest way to break it down. ,Classic
161104, We leave at once. ,Classic
163047, I wish you to know that I bear you no malice. ,Classic
5298, There's a pipe here. It runs right round the block of ice. ,Classic
91750," Well, it's dead, anyway. ",Classic
26947," Oh, they're very pleasant. Yes, they're both very pleasant apart from their juvenile exuberances. I'm sure you'll like them. They must be at the back here somewhere. I think they're rather worried because I'm a bit late joining them. ",Classic
95118, Meaning I think we're being watched. ,Classic
117172, What? ,Classic
107787, Hey! ,Classic
157945," By express order of the Great Architect, surveillance of the swimming pool is not allowed. Not allowed. ",Classic
27644, It will not be possible. ,Classic
51479," Well, yes, I know that, but what for? ",Classic
4653, If we return. ,Classic
35570, Nils? ,Classic
127327," So be it. Consul Kassia, we appoint you Keeper Nominate. Do you accept or reject? ",Classic
12377, None finer this side of Rome. ,Classic
9257, Sounded like an order. ,Classic
146468, Then why don't you? ,Classic
64454, Now I'm sure you'll want to get back to the Space Centre. ,Classic
132857, Look at his calculations before you decide. It may be possible. ,Classic
76427, I said fire!   ,Classic
149378, Is it too much to enquire what that function might be? ,Classic
119308," Well, you'd. What's your name? ",Classic
45895," If you want to leave, Mister Chorley, no one's stopping you. Now, when did all this happen? ",Classic
60069," Yes, I think so. Come on, let's see what else we can find. ",Classic
109585, The ones the Minyans call the gods. ,Classic
163444," Well, first we go through this. Brigadier, I'll go first. Ace ",Classic
131573, Is it an energy barrier? ,Classic
81244," Ah, the transporter has arrived at last. ",Classic
109904," Not I, the then Chancellor. ",Classic
87094, She's all right. ,Classic
66439, Get on your feet when the Section Leader's talking to you! ,Classic
40272, No! ,Classic
142460, Stop that man! Stop! Hold him! ,Classic
11916, Doctor! ,Classic
138688, I might even improve on it. ,Classic
109884," No, only the arrogance with which you present it. ",Classic
87749," Aye, well, this is the bit you're not going to like. ",Classic
39495, What is happening? What are you going to do with me? ,Classic
142718, As if some tremendous forcefield's pulled it out of shape. ,Classic
26052, Here's one. ,Classic
53562," Well, er ",Classic
19352," Get back. You are reckless and stupid. Now you have gained only one thing, the death of another of your kind. Doctor! You and the girl will come with me.   You stay here. ",Classic
75387, More stolen information? ,Classic
86073," Linx, you dog! Where are you hiding?   Oh, there you are, you dragon eyed toad. Who puts these bonds on you? ",Classic
100599, Get in touch with Whitehall and tell them we've got a full scale emergency. ,Classic
120313," Oh, if only I had my charts here, I could have told you your horoscope. I'm sure this was your lucky day. ",Classic
5489, I don't want people prying into my affairs. Has she been asking questions about me? ,Classic
25915," Well yes, a little, but why say it at all? ",Classic
144096, The Doctor without his companions would be rather incongruous. ,Classic
129718, I fancy I've made our quarters private enough. ,Classic
109957, Zero seven three? ,Classic
106007, Yes. ,Classic
87009, Whitaker? ,Classic
32606," But Ben, think of all those poor people all killed. ",Classic
38589," Well, that is impossible, unless Waterfield could have invented a time machine like the Tardis, Doctor, and he's bringing all this stuff back from Victorian times. ",Classic
120892," Doctor, I've been calculating our chances of success. ",Classic
64351," No, I'll run a security trace on our prisoner. ",Classic
113348," What are we going to do, Doctor? ",Classic
110812, Victory over time? ,Classic
114550, I did not. ,Classic
53472, Eh? ,Classic
102395, How do we hear his voice? ,Classic
8391," I assure you, dear boy, my spirits couldn't be higher. Collecting evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, calculating it, pursuing it until it's inevitable. It's fascinating. ",Classic
156200," Well, if I do, then it is unreservedly offered, madam. ",Classic
13124," The Emperors' instructions! Well, now that you've found Barbara, where are you making for? ",Classic
132624, What I wanted to show you. ,Classic
140565, Hmm? What? Goodness me! The Tardis! ,Classic
112172, What's that? ,Classic
143103," Don't tell me you're lost, Doctor. Because if you are, so am I. ",Classic
107165, But now that Mitchell's dead. ,Classic
101052, I wonder how long it's been like this? ,Classic
117964," Yeah, but you don't know what it looks like, do ya? I reckon you're banjaxed, my old son. End of the road. Finito. ",Classic
39762, Because you question. Defend yourselves. Destroy the Emperor or be destroyed yourselves! ,Classic
85087," Sergeant Benton!   Well, that seems to be the last of them, Benton. Let's get back to the Brigadier. ",Classic
28972, We must be in the seventeenth Century. ,Classic
18256, Yes. ,Classic
117420," Oh, they use disintegration capsules like we do. ",Classic
72180," Right-o, lad. I'll do my best to be absolutely super. Super. ",Classic
142453, Are you all right? ,Classic
82539, Very well. He will remain your prisoner until the war is concluded. Then you will bring him to us and we shall exterminate him. We shall now return to our base and prepare the army of the Daleks. ,Classic
143897, Ninety years I was frozen in that. Ninety years of mind-numbing boredom. ,Classic
136069, For control. Come over here. ,Classic
63903," I'm afraid you won't be able to do that. Thanks to you, the humans are no longer making power. Their generator has been switched off. ",Classic
78171, I seem to have heard that before. ,Classic
77876, Doctor Cook. ,Classic
131005, What would happen if one person dreamt here alone? ,Classic
84677," That's a very good question, Jo.",Classic
124364, What are we going to do now? ,Classic
17096," Hey, we're two years out. ",Classic
152895, How? ,Classic
25472, Goodbye! Sorry about your kitchen. ,Classic
141098," Die, it seems.",Classic
69560," Oh, Doctor, do I gather that the tables have turned somewhat at Stangmoor?",Classic
95819, This interrogation will be conducted in an orderly manner. Failure to comply will result in your immediate execution. ,Classic
159304," Well, it's not my fault this decade's got no street cred. I mean, look at that kid. ",Classic
133339, Report position. ,Classic
47278, There's a file. It's probably in the middle drawer of my desk in the study. Could you get it and bring it to me at the control room? ,Classic
93581, I'm afraid my people won't be much help. They don't like fighting. ,Classic
130479," Bacteria. Or even worse, viri, as in virulent. Am I getting warmer? Change and decay in all around I see, eh? Out there! ",Classic
40308," Logic, my dear Professor, logic and power. On Earth the Brotherhood of Logicians is the greatest man intelligence ever assembled. But that's not enough by itself. We need power. Power to put our ability into action. The Cybermen have this power. I have come here to find it and use it. ",Classic
121724, Why? ,Classic
71822," Put a man with a communicator on that hill overlooking the dome. If they do try to leave the ship, he can call up a security squad. ",Classic
120638, I beg your pardon. ,Classic
92640, You say you came here by transmat beam? ,Classic
104943, Understanding? ,Classic
19942," Sit down. Sit down! In my life I have travelled far, and met many deplorable people, but not one of them has had the credulity strained as I have strained today by your effrontery, Doctor. Your story is probably true, otherwise you would never have dared to tell it. Stand up! I propose to release you. ",Classic
154360, I should like to see that sequence. ,Classic
150641," Eh? Well, come on, then.",Classic
130538, Everything. ,Classic
72445, Did you say the Devil? ,Classic
12299, We can travel anywhere and everywhere in that old box as you call it. Regardless of space and time. ,Classic
64921, No. We can't get enough of the standard fuel in time. ,Classic
96246," No, not that. I mean the thing. ",Classic
116263, Why the Sons of Earth? ,Classic
111559," Doctor, I'm over here!   Quickly! Doctor, do something!   ",Classic
161916," If she has, she'll regret it. ",Classic
81142, Until the Captain can find time to see me. I know. ,Classic
35062," Doctor, is he? ",Classic
39274," So, with the Dalek's eye stick pointing forward, Kemel and I were able to tiptoe up behind him, throw the rope over his head and throw him into the fire. ",Classic
75580, Ask Green Gilbert. ,Classic
101086," You've got no faith, have you. Come on, Eldrad.   It's perfectly all right as long as you don't look down.   You coming? ",Classic
44027, What news of Denes? We must keep him posted as to what is happening.,Classic
61839," The police box is on its way back to headquarters, so you can double the guard here. ",Classic
2272, What if we show you the ship? Explain it to you. Help you to build another? ,Classic
103321, Go to Uvanov's quarters as fast as you can. Zilda came on the command speaker and accused him of being the killer. He's left Control like a scale twenty blow. ,Classic
124262, There are two of them. He's innocent. ,Classic
24192, How long from now? ,Classic
117515, Astra. ,Classic
142810," There's the darkening of the sky. Oh, it's all right, the Warnsman will sound his klaxon at the first sign. ",Classic
77189, Come in Hyperion! This is urgent! Skybase One on open channel!,Classic
84331," Yes, for cleaning purposes. ",Classic
98083,   The Doctor is returning. ,Classic
86701, I was chairman of the committee that considered his application for a government grant. ,Classic
52792, I wonder if you could help us? ,Classic
132845, Of course he will. ,Classic
18002, Grown for what purpose? ,Classic
53102, They must be destroyed. ,Classic
36460, Don't lie. That is a secret known only to three people in the Colony. ,Classic
141838," The technology of these creatures predates yours by millions of years. If they intend to fire those missiles, they have the means, I assure you. ",Classic
88820, The Federation does not use such methods. ,Classic
78371, Bye. ,Classic
16622," Their leader, the one they call Doctor. Is the reproducer programmed? ",Classic
55381, It is still of value. It can give information about the other creatures.) ,Classic
61975," Ah, there you are, my dear fellow. I expect you're wondering how I found you here? ",Classic
15295," Look, quick, they've gone to the right. Let's get them. ",Classic
156460," Doctor, this machine has to be repaired and you're the only person with the knowledge to do it. ",Classic
156649, Where? ,Classic
3348, The old man lied to me! ,Classic
66613," You just don't listen, do you? You heard what he said. There's nothing we can do. Is that right, Doctor? ",Classic
63182, What was it like? ,Classic
128068, Yes. Yes. ,Classic
19779, Now don't think I'm not pleased with what you've done. I am. ,Classic
35638," I refuse to believe that. Everything's got a weak point. It's just a question of waiting until it shows up, that's all. ",Classic
2939," Shang Tu? That's in China, isn't it?",Classic
50637," Oh, come now ",Classic
65436, Okay. ,Classic
13238," Well, it's not there now. ",Classic
144285, This is lunacy. ,Classic
72398," Yes, well. ",Classic
93677," No, it's not that. I don't know what he's got prepared for you, but believe me, he's ready. ",Classic
61593, Here is your first choice. ,Classic
38785, But they ordered you not to tell your friend McCrimmon anything. ,Classic
57523," Seventeen, Ian, until the one at New Sarum's replaced. ",Classic
67393," Well, I am Luigi Rossini, internationally, and conjurers I don't need. Okay? ",Classic
50963," Oh you're mad, the lot of you. ",Classic
59250," Well, I well I believe that they call it The War to End Wars. ",Classic
147776," Come on, Griffiths. You're getting two million pounds for what would be little more than a day's work. ",Classic
85447," If you'll allow me to do so. Good night, Miss Smith. ",Classic
67127, It was repaired some time ago. ,Classic
73113, Cease firing! ,Classic
86647, What's the difference? ,Classic
20822, But he helped us. ,Classic
124477, I suppose so. ,Classic
87894," It's all right, Peter. One of us has to select the parrinium from the digging. ",Classic
157920, One hundred and seventy. All the messy creatures will be moving up to the swimming pool zone on floor three oh four. Luckily they won't have time to make it too untidy before I destroy them! I have nothing to fear. Nobody knows my Paradise Towers better than I do.,Classic
65647," No, sir. The lads are still looking. ",Classic
148139," Yes, he's going. Yes, he's snuffed it! ",Classic
73966," Monia, we're wasting valuable time. Every minute that goes by ",Classic
113360, Right. ,Classic
66642, Nothing's on its way! We've been left here to die. ,Classic
140600," And now, young fellow, tell me all about it. ",Classic
72065, My new book comes out tomorrow. ,Classic
144313, Well done. ,Classic
31960, It's madness! ,Classic
25144," Oh, yes, my dear.",Classic
67364," Doctor, if you hadn't chosen such a crucial moment to disappear, this whole business might have been cleared up a great deal sooner. ",Classic
111206, What is it? ,Classic
14108," Barbara, the Destructor. Take it! ",Classic
124864," Attention, Citizen Dampier, report to coordinator immediately. ",Classic
80580, The eradicator was designed only for use against organic molecules. ,Classic
39512," No. No, thank you. Why don't you answer me. You little fool! ",Classic
72427," Get him over to that bench, quickly! ",Classic
10852, All right. ,Classic
90458, We'd better get out of here. ,Classic
73063, You are bold. ,Classic
283," Layer of sand, rock formation. Good. ",Classic
51162, But the Quarks will do it more quickly. ,Classic
2065, Yes. What happened to Barbara? ,Classic
152349, I love a woman who plays hard to get. ,Classic
38248, Yes. Yes. ,Classic
148782," Well, er, a little zeiton-7 would be quite useful, not to say essential. ",Classic
27808," All right, Tor. I am here. ",Classic
65956," Yes, well I'll tell you something that should be of vital interest to you, Professor. ",Classic
64556," Oh, very well then, I'll take you there now. But I can assure you they're perfectly safe.",Classic
17422," Vicki, there's only one way we can find out what's going on in there. That's to break in. ",Classic
115634, Right. ,Classic
84144," You know, Global Chemicals is beginning to interest me. Tell me, Professor, do you know the layout? ",Classic
39524, We must go more quickly. ,Classic
153515, How does the great door open? ,Classic
121436," Well, maybe it's because she's innocent. How'd you know she did it? ",Classic
146674, Their gastric tracts. Rotting vegetables. ,Classic
52055, You may be suitable. ,Classic
18543," Nonsense. Let us stop this thought of killing anyone. Now, madam, back to your spaceship. Back please. ",Classic
141022," Well, Doctor, what are we going to do? ",Classic
39283, You'll never find her. ,Classic
107234, There. Do you see it? ,Classic
139602, I followed him in. ,Classic
78999," Now look, Jo, I. No, not really.   Greetings. ",Classic
106607, Where to? ,Classic
117788, Yeah. ,Classic
69477," No, sir. ",Classic
45729," Right, Thompson, that's the best we can do. Now go and tell the Corporal to get the men back here as fast as he can.   No. No, you're too late. Stay where you are. Lane! Lane! Fall back! You'll never hold them! ",Classic
128208, And the murder of innocent Earth people. ,Classic
79571," Doctor Tyler, you're not going anywhere. ",Classic
83782," You know, I might even get a hold of one of those famous blue sapphires. Well, there you are. That should do it, I think. ",Classic
130292, Until we took the hostages. ,Classic
59284," Right, sir. ",Classic
115229, Is this yours? ,Classic
35507, Why did they go to so such trouble? ,Classic
31465," China. Yes, I went there once I believe. Met Marco Polo. ",Classic
29045," If you ain't got it, you knows it's whereabouts. Avery's gold. ",Classic
145277," Well done, sir. I suppose you started in the ranks. ",Classic
164467," Oh, shut up, Crane. You're familiar with the Prisoner's Dilemma, then? ",Classic
48214," John, listen to me. We can't help you unless you help us. ",Classic
122583, I've never seen anything quite like this before. ,Classic
87570, I see. ,Classic
96394, Bring it. ,Classic
114027," What are you suggesting, Romana? Some kind of sisterhood that's been worshipping these stones for, when was the convent founded? Twelfth century, wasn't it? For seven hundred odd years? That's a little bit hard to believe, isn't it? ",Classic
5470," But surely, if you know where the key is, that's proof. ",Classic
29744," Well, you seem to forget, young man, that I've already met Pike, and I know something that he doesn't. The clue to the treasure. ",Classic
13929," Very well, I will go in alone from the north. ",Classic
65883, Mmm? ,Classic
138219," Oh, that's all we need. ",Classic
109440, This is more like it! Come on! ,Classic
71492," Well, a claim to unusual historical interest, for instance. ",Classic
159998, You were born to serve the Daleks. ,Classic
61296," No, it's not, Zoe. But I'm afraid that there's no alternative. ",Classic
113217, Yes. Would you go to those lengths just to stay alive? ,Classic
158556, Now! ,Classic
101837," Empty, but enough traces to analyse, no doubt. Thank you, Commander. And report back after you've restructured the Master. ",Classic
138878," Please hurry. Your demand for energy is causing an overload. Quickly, the message. ",Classic
45226," You won't get away from me, Kent. ",Classic
13581, I cannot suspend my functions for your experiments. ,Classic
99615, Yes. Just a minute. ,Classic
139792, There's nothing we can do. ,Classic
155731," If you're looking for a certain tape, Doctor, I don't think you'll find it in there. ",Classic
133255," No, of course not. There's nothing there for me any more. ",Classic
29924," Because I was a fool and ill led. Answer enough lies there, surely. ",Classic
39219, How else do you suppose that I persuaded Victoria to go to the Daleks? ,Classic
36402, Medok! How did you get here? ,Classic
111597, Speak. ,Classic
136082, Good morning. ,Classic
110316," Well, I had the benefit of your training. ",Classic
1501, Take this. ,Classic
42531," That was from your staff, Jamie's extra. ",Classic
86664," Oh, yes, yes, of course. Er, let's see now, there was this this Chinese scientist called Chun Sen. Oh, hang about, he hasn't been born yet, has he. ",Classic
106244," Some kind of organism that attacks the mind, the intelligence. It's trying to take me over, Leela. It's trying to change me. ",Classic
109323, Who was he? ,Classic
126426, I'll go down that way. You have a look in there. ,Classic
55810," Yes, there is just a chance. But be ready. Axus, a minute. ",Classic
67900, I'll let you know as soon as I think of any. ,Classic
67893, Not quite. ,Classic
55538," Zoe, I'd say it was a safe bet that that machine is composed of tellurium. ",Classic
324," Barbara, you can't ",Classic
78244," I give you my firm pledge, Krasis. The crystal is totally inactive. ",Classic
67261, I'll look. Will you treat him carefully? ,Classic
128642," We already have, Doctor. ",Classic
124458, I have lost control of the Tardis. ,Classic
11250, Daleks! ,Classic
125373, Master? ,Classic
110671," I can't, but Rassilon can. ",Classic
76127, It's an assignment. ,Classic
2692," If one small piece of apparatus fails, a little bulb illuminates and tells me precisely where the fault is. Can you imagine what would happen if the whole of it lights up? Hmm? It means that the ship is on the point of disintegration. You're not to blame. All four of us are to blame! ",Classic
32619," No, where does it remind you of? ",Classic
152893," Immediately, Immortal. ",Classic
28485," Look, I've got to get out of here. Come on, get out of the way!   Look, Polly, get out of the way. ",Classic
68035," What? Do you mean that they haven't got a scanning molecular structure analyser in stock? Oh really, Brigadier. You should keep this place better supplied, you know. I cannot work without proper equipment. ",Classic
128320," Please. Shush. As Time Lords, you and I have special responsibilities. ",Classic
76528," The box, it was for you. But that's why I followed you. ",Classic
42916, I don't know. ,Classic
48038," No. Not unless she'd been persuaded to. Jamie, I think we'd better go and look for her. Come on. You go that way. I'll go this way.",Classic
150229, Even in clear it's still possible to detect with tracking equipment. We should have chosen a less populous planet. ,Classic
147791, Shut up! ,Classic
103872, Your wife came on stage? ,Classic
91861, Thank heaven for that. Well done. The Doctor will be delighted. ,Classic
9605," Good. Now, I'm reasonably certain that your group are working with, or for, Jules Renan. I think you used his hideout. Certainly you know where it is, and if you don't, your granddaughter does. ",Classic
73519," Oh, when's it fixed for? ",Classic
159044," Well, that explains about Kane, but where does the creature come from? ",Classic
16465," There's nobody here, Willoughby. ",Classic
126624, Contraction curve exponential. Estimate on present data beyond capability of this unit. ,Classic
75640,"   I tell you I must speak to the Minister. It's most important. Well, when do you expect him back? No, I can't tell you what's wrong. The security of the nation is at risk. Oh, very well, I'll hold on, but please hurry!     No, it can't wait till the morning. Oh, you'll have to interrupt his meeting. This is a matter of national urgency. Oh, very well, as soon as he's free then. But if there's any unnecessary delay, believe me, you'll answer for it.   Guard?  (Elsewhere, a telephone smashes on the floor and a guard falls next to it. Trenchard unlocks a drawer in his desk and takes out his service revolver, checking that it is loaded. ",Classic
140092, Your Majesty does me great honour. And my first action in this role shall be to arrest that man. Arrest Sir Geoffrey de Lacy. ,Classic
62199, Destroy! Total destruction! ,Classic
66479, What anxieties? ,Classic
113800," Well, I ",Classic
160169, Right. ,Classic
30334, What is it Doctor? What's up? ,Classic
92695, Clock expert? ,Classic
98296, Solon? ,Classic
146506," Ten seconds, to be precise. You'll find yourself in the Tardis.",Classic
51346, Look! ,Classic
88310," Not all of them, your Majesty. ",Classic
99622, I'll give you a guided tour someday. ,Classic
156204," I was there, remember? ",Classic
160900, Over there. ,Classic
31726, What is it? It could be the answer to all our problems.,Classic
54474," Well, don't look so worried. Fancy a cup of tea?",Classic
16780, You mean you can't. ,Classic
50187, She's gone to take the Doctor and Jamie back to the rocket. ,Classic
53369," Yes, but that's what worrying me. ",Classic
115286," Anyway, how can you possibly be frightened of something that goes pfft if it short-circuits? ",Classic
35872, That's right. ,Classic
103989, How did you do it? ,Classic
71655, Very well. I'll go and check up on the guards.,Classic
109164, Skyfall on eight and a Trog making trouble. ,Classic
135574, You two come with me. ,Classic
48015, I don't know. I just don't know.,Classic
56944, It's nervous exhaustion and a slight touch of claustrophobia. Just sit down and we'll have a rest.,Classic
42172," Oh, must we? ",Classic
32041," Oh, I can't do crosswords. ",Classic
161938," He'll have to be punished, Morgana. ",Classic
52708," We obey our creator. That is all that is expected of any character, unless the Master bids us otherwise.",Classic
153107, Will I be needed? ,Classic
32323," You forget, my dear Hensell. They're not your guards, they're mine. ",Classic
134104, It's amazing. ,Classic
124349, Good. Let's get on with it. ,Classic
149875, Do you think we should go on any further? ,Classic
82560, Yes. ,Classic
150644, It's too big. ,Classic
53020, I hope they're all right. ,Classic
98292, What do you mean? ,Classic
97747," Oh no, I thought I recognised the face. ",Classic
136911," Yes, certainly. ",Classic
127162, Really? ,Classic
3960," We want gold, not Kublai Khan's paper money. ",Classic
12383, How many of them are there? ,Classic
67636," Well, it's the wrong colour and the wrong texture. Of course it's ruined! ",Classic
49072," Oh, this is going to be fun. I shall learn a lot from you. Come on, James Robert McCrimmon. Do you know anything about interstellar flora? ",Classic
39545," Up to all sorts of tricks, aren't they? ",Classic
65183, Just what do you want? ,Classic
27826, Somebody's moving. ,Classic
159205, Are you some kind of idiot? ,Classic
43213, Well. ,Classic
82227," Doctor, listen! That sound! ",Classic
145489," As they used to say on Earth, every cloud has a strontium lining, Krau Timmin. ",Classic
40786," Yes. Ah, yes.",Classic
97072," Benton, it's us! ",Classic
52314, Useful for those who intend to travel ,Classic
19965," Oh really, Cassandra. You're always going on and on about it yourself. ",Classic
90865," JPKettlewell, Robotics Section. He left some time ago, didn't he? That's right, there was all that fuss about it in the press. ",Classic
64542, Security. ,Classic
72890, Right. Well let's see if you can turn aside a bullet. ,Classic
27279, Right. ,Classic
164293," Control, help me! ",Classic
106656," Bracing, isn't it? ",Classic
13410, Something wrong with these? ,Classic
129414, And you are? ,Classic
67561," Really? Well, the research boys'll be glad to get their hands on this. ",Classic
55078," And now we know what happens to them. But you can summon the Krotons, can't you? ",Classic
111545," Good. Let's locate it, convert it, and get out of here before the locals wake up.",Classic
34114," Tell me, why do you need a compass? ",Classic
142711, What about the colony ship? Must have been brimming with gadgetry. ,Classic
15288, They had a ray gun. I saw it. ,Classic
55974, Morning. Just as well you've arrived. ,Classic
42119, Switch the stabilising circuits through to computer control. ,Classic
135265," Ah yes. How long will you be staying for, Mister Stuart? ",Classic
70077, And what is your decision? ,Classic
30250," Yes, we read you loud and clear. ",Classic
133680, What are they doing? ,Classic
34639, Stabilisers normal. Nothing to report. ,Classic
89236, My warriors are being destroyed. You must stop him! ,Classic
130992, And then what? ,Classic
65200, Ambassadors!,Classic
90356," Now, wait a minute. ",Classic
79506," Huh? Why, it's the Doctor, isn't it? And Miss Grant. ",Classic
55559, Stop! ,Classic
106482," Ah, Doctor, what are you doing? We've just had an ultimatum. ",Classic
120161, Why should he do that? ,Classic

68768," We can't stay here, Harry. They'll starve us out. ",Classic
42266, Are you all right? ,Classic
147656," Well, you must do something. Inform Earth, tell them it's coming. I mean, what's happening to us now must have something to do with that.",Classic
14009, What do they want now? ,Classic
135040, The Master can't land. ,Classic
105447, Doctor? ,Classic
136190," Exquisite, isn't it. ",Classic
9914," Oh, don't be childish. They opened. The doors opened before we properly materialised. ",Classic
32469, We will fight   for you. ,Classic
12308," Vicki, are you going to come with us? ",Classic

41489, Look! ,Classic
73223, I was working late. I must have dropped off. Freak gust of wind blew some papers off my desk. I woke up rather confused. I was picking up the papers when Miss Paget came in. ,Classic
55335," Yes, I think you're right, Zoe. Zoe, look! ",Classic
72640," All right, Doctor, we'll try it your way, but get a move on, will you? ",Classic
53936," Yes, we have, sir. A computer and various radio and radar components. ",Classic
31794," Oh, you'll find it easy enough. Look. Around, then to your right, in the next block. ",Classic
143790, This is more than a military matter now. I have to speak to the Ministry of Defence. We'll need a massive troop involvement. ,Classic
55663, If that comes down we shall all be killed! ,Classic
65646, Anything on Slocum? ,Classic
8435," I'm glad you're on my side, Doctor. ",Classic
131740, It didn't take them long to find us. ,Classic
17345, Did you question him? ,Classic
101904," Half the city in ruins. Untold damage, countless lives lost. ",Classic
103239, What are you doing? ,Classic
67225," Why, what happened? ",Classic
23255," I don't know. A stranger. English, I think. ",Classic
75001, You've inspected the boat yourself? ,Classic
117632, And the chronodyne chip? ,Classic
86534, Will you get an accurate fix? ,Classic
17330," Wulnoth, we can't just let them go! ",Classic
71785," By genetic engineering, they developed a super-race. That priest we saw must be a remnant of it. ",Classic
113121," Oh, can't I? ",Classic
71546," Well, no, he just arrived here. ",Classic
150337, You are not efficient. All that should have been done. ,Classic
153552, The destruction of the converter's aerial. ,Classic
23006," Oh, dust. Nothing but dust! ",Classic
24203," Yes, but where, sir? I can only see but a few people. ",Classic
7410," Ian, please let me go with them. Because I can use telepathy, they trust me. ",Classic
5689," Goodbye, my friends. ",Classic
165126, We can release Captain Sorin to help us. I can distract the guard.,Classic
93010, Psst. Here. ,Classic
59734, I can't! ,Classic
147613," Does it really matter? He won't learn very much, and we certainly aren't going anywhere except Telos, wherever that is. ",Classic
74453, Only the alien's death can purify the holy temple of Aggedor. ,Classic
86411," But things that size, where could they go? ",Classic
24546, I have a simple plan that will destroy them. When we start our life on that planet it will be with no reference of any kind to the time when we were secondary beings! ,Classic
114728," Oh, that old thing. ",Classic
135408," We're sorry, child, but truly there's no other choice. ",Classic
123977, Can you remember the rest of what you said? ,Classic
155137," It was Grenville, sir. A mineralogist. ",Classic
3045," Fab? What is that, Susan?",Classic
137990, I am not! ,Classic
103837,"   Help me, 7! ",Classic
91190," Well then, what we do and where we go is none of your business, is it? Come along, Professor. ",Classic
10218," Ian, look at this. ",Classic
59352," That's right. Now, what did you make of these civilians? ",Classic
98369," The Time Lords will not oppose me again, nor the Sisterhood. When it is learnt that I, Morbius, have returned from the grave, my followers will rise in their millions. ",Classic
92716, How do you reckon to help us? ,Classic
35962, Come out of it. ,Classic
36305," We can't stop here. Come on, quick! ",Classic
78773," No, I'm sorry. She does not wish to be disturbed. The Lord Master is with her. ",Classic
53616," There's just about time enough to effect a simple rescue operation. Come along, Jamie.",Classic
107755, I did! ,Classic
84653," Oh, in there! Horrible, it is! ",Classic
151626, No! You've tricked me! ,Classic
119775, Where are we? ,Classic
15245," Lost a button? Hmm, that's interesting. Yes, that's very interesting. ",Classic
95111, Unless something has happened to Murdlar. Test the syncron response. ,Classic
75753, The depths of the sea and those areas on Earth where man cannot live can be yours. ,Classic
53970," Well, the answer's simple, surely. Go and get some proof. ",Classic
148829, Who by? ,Classic
129168," The books are old, but they chronicle the rise of Castrovalva up to the present day. ",Classic
9817," Orders? Orders? Don't tell me that, my man, I was there, remember? I saw you conniving with him all the time. ",Classic
91049, Who was this man? ,Classic
8271, I greet you. ,Classic
107942," Well I'm delighted to. Oh, no, no, we're just tourists. We're not staying.   On the other hand, it is quite cozy. Don't you think it's quite cozy here? ",Classic
39850, Really? Does it show? ,Classic
149539, Sure. ,Classic
16400, What's this all about? ,Classic
149096," Doctor, when we went past the bathhouse, that instrument of yours",Classic
127061, It's hard to say. ,Classic
110186, Then you must stop them! ,Classic
19122, But they're Refusians! ,Classic
144656, You keep away from me. ,Classic
164328," Oh, I am, my dear. We both are. ",Classic
43833," Yes, I thought that's what we were leading up to. ",Classic
124013, So be it. ,Classic
83452, What do you want us to do? ,Classic
55476, I meant you don't know what's happening. He is no longer your deputy. He's taken over as council leader. ,Classic
129344," To reduce matter, of course. ",Classic
26289," Yes, but my dear boy, I ",Classic
83976," Dave! Help me, Dave! Help me! ",Classic
89686," Oh, that's fascinating. ",Classic
125896," Come on, Adric. We've got to get out of here. ",Classic
9931, I just know the most dangerous moment is at the point of materialisation. ,Classic
64652," It's the most extraordinary thing. The radioactive contamination has almost vanished. If you can't get Recovery 8 ready in time, you can use this capsule. ",Classic
21720, The fool! He's tried his experiment with G-force and reliance power. ,Classic
74477, He cannot be given an honourable alternative. ,Classic
26843," Now you cut that out, Ringo! ",Classic
82069," Oh, take him back to Sirius 4 and see that he stands trial. You wouldn't believe the list of crimes he's committed.",Classic
31038," The answer is no! We'll just sit tight here until Mondas breaks up. Now then, you'd better release the Doctor and Polly and send them down here. You're gonna need our help when Mondas is gone. ",Classic
2423, What's he doing there? ,Classic
41704, What? What? ,Classic
154170," I've never tried. It could be fatal, used as a means of interrogation. ",Classic
63644," Yes, the first one.",Classic
16617, I obey. ,Classic
119492," No, Mona Lisas. How did the Count know where they were? How did he know where to get them? ",Classic
6577," Be quiet. Tonila, we freely forgive you your sins against us. ",Classic
8657, We must be leaving now. The soldiers will have followed! ,Classic
18367," Yes, that was one of the Rills, I suppose. ",Classic
162696, A disguise. ,Classic
88420," Look, I was lost, that's all. There was someone in there and I wanted to ask the way. ",Classic
57954, Yes. ,Classic
107943, It's turning into subway CT1. ,Classic
87515," Yes, right. You won't go away, will you?   Doctor? Doctor?   Doctor? Doctor? Doctor?   Blood. ",Classic
114947, You question my commands? ,Classic
57051," Gregson, eh? ",Classic
51779," Zoe, listen to me. If we move outside the Tardis, we step into a dimension about which we know nothing. We should be at the mercy of the forces outside time and space as we know it. ",Classic
32568, I want to help you. ,Classic
124759, Why did they choose this cave? ,Classic
13992, May I know its secret? ,Classic
104220," I'm a man of character and determination, sir. The Rock of Gibraltar would be more easily, more easily. ",Classic
124973," No, no! Perhaps they haven't let you in on the secret, Login. Shall I tell him, gentlemen? ",Classic
52634, Halt! Now we shall play games no longer.,Classic
40369, Everything we decide is carried out. There are no mistakes.,Classic
125455, Doesn't feel natural. There's that noise again. ,Classic
153340, That makes you very unusual for a star traveller who is interested in the Great Totem. ,Classic
42022," Doctor, why will you not accept the aid of our warrior brothers? ",Classic
22549, Mavic Chen can issue the ultimatum. Bring Chen to the voice audio. ,Classic
44432,"   Of course, my friend. Don't worry. ",Classic
102071, Spread out. She must be here somewhere. ,Classic
53783,(The Doctor and Jamie paddle a rigid canoe down the Regents canal leading under a bridge. ,Classic
15968, Now you've squashed my favourite Beatles! ,Classic
66174," Carry on, Doctor Williams. ",Classic
107842, I never heard of it. ,Classic
75733, Send a signal to Captain Hart. Tell him that a Mister Walker is here to see him. ,Classic
67324," Zero minus one minute, twenty seconds. ",Classic
128103, I don't understand. I don't understand. ,Classic
142496, The Tardis is in the crypt. I think we should take a look. ,Classic
121740, How very odd. How very strange.   How very clever.   The profits on human suffering. ,Classic
20144," Yes, quite. After all, you do claim to know the future. ",Classic
137602, Someone on this ship has been trying to regenerate. ,Classic
159157," Here, how'd you do that, then? ",Classic
17985," When a planet disintegrates, nothing survives. ",Classic
152877," I know what you mean, and I still want to get away from here. ",Classic
81848, See you later. ,Classic
31170," His face, his hair, look at it. ",Classic
69097," All right, fixed that. Here, you all right? ",Classic
61252, All this talk! When we fight? ,Classic
117436," Well, you know, form, condition, tone. ",Classic
107537," Oh, don't worry, John. He's only frightened like the rest of us. ",Classic
53669," Come on, Jamie. Hurry up!   Get us out of here! Hold on, Jamie! ",Classic
116223, It was a question about ,Classic
53170," Call me any time. I'm usually available. Now, I'd better lay on transport to get you two back to London.",Classic
87994," Yes. Come on, old chap. ",Classic
44716," No, no, it's all right. But you must believe me. Colin, all of you. You cannot return to the surface until is safe to do so. Please my friend, we must, we must",Classic
116906," Shapp.   Bah, it's useless. Don't play the fool with me.   What is the purpose of your visit? ",Classic
54223," Don't worry, Jamie. Finish your tea and go back to sleep. ",Classic
158733, Ace! ,Classic
43772, A dictator? Like Napoleon? ,Classic
56254, Good! ,Classic
77321," Thank you, Professor, that will be all.   Well, gentleman, we have heard the evidence. In the absence of evidence to the contrary I have no alternative but to exonerate you from blame ",Classic
137409," (Turlough wakes from his nightmare and goes to the door. It is still locked. He picks up the Guardian's crystal and wraps it in the bedclothes, then uses some clean sheets to make a rope ladder. ",Classic
37274," Well, perhaps he changed his mind and decided to go off on a different tour then. ",Classic
91447, Exactly. ,Classic
121099," Oh, a dear friend. He was my mentor. We worked on this idea together before he died, of course. Then we stopped. You knew him? ",Classic
92490," What are you going to do, Doctor? ",Classic
82991, You see the furs they wear to protect them from the cold. ,Classic
31348, But with five minutes ,Classic
26004, Holliday! ,Classic
131087, He would! ,Classic
165350," I'd have done anything not to hurt you, but I had to save you from Fenric's evil curse. Your faith in me was holding the haemovore back. ",Classic
116675, Too dangerous. ,Classic
136874," Well, the Snake Dancers wear these, don't they? ",Classic
52716," But all the power had been used up on the soldiers and it was useless. Oh, you'll have to do better than that. ",Classic
78598, Doctor! ,Classic
119445," Oh, thank you. ",Classic
48290, No. I should have thought of this. ,Classic
147125, Something I should have done a long time ago. ,Classic
62185, I know. ,Classic
72241, Eoh evohay! ,Classic
102716," Well, I'll explain it all   Flashing? He's put the atomic generators on overload. He got desperate sooner than I thought. ",Classic
1318," No, we're still prisoners. ",Classic
148481, A waste of effort. I assume there will be something novel by way of spectacle to mark my return to that state? ,Classic
35250, We're nearly out of this interferon stuff. ,Classic
34643," Priority, priority. Reactor station Z3 calling. Reactor station Z3 calling. ",Classic
96368," I'm sure you don't, but it's very nice of you to try. Now, why don't you show me how this gadget works? ",Classic
115941, But you don't know how to use them. ,Classic
85514," Oh, it must be some sort of pageant. I say! Hey, you there!   Hey! What are you doing? Get off! Let go! Hey. ",Classic
95197, Loch Ness? ,Classic
150115, Killed the Doctor. ,Classic
1937," Well, is it? ",Classic
131719," I, too, have a ship of sorts. It isn't the most reliable of machines, but it's aged memory banks might contain something of use. ",Classic
128458, We've still got to get across to the antenna control room. ,Classic
988," Do you want to know where you can sleep, Miss Wright? ",Classic
161005, No reply. ,Classic
137497, That's not an unreasonable question. ,Classic
108962," Go on, get back! Get back to that panel. And you, too, get back. I'll take them out now, sir. Just one quick blast. ",Classic
19260, Looks like some kind of kitchen. ,Classic
54918, We don't even know if they exist. ,Classic
133287, Get that transponder code fed into the navigational computer at once. I want to get underway. ,Classic
50174, He is not important.,Classic
76320, Open it! ,Classic
137555, I agree. ,Classic
118458, Return to your work! ,Classic
34249, Don't worry about us. Just cling on. ,Classic
120842," Erato, you came here for your own good and offered the deal to the wrong person. Will you now condemn an entire planet of innocent people to death? ",Classic
108415, If there's anything I can do to help the Company? Long life the Company. ,Classic
159133," Stop, hold your fire. All right, come out. ",Classic
124814, What have you done to it? ,Classic
75549," Right, small arms, Number One. ",Classic
68821, What are you going to do with them? ,Classic
13706, Peculiar. ,Classic
30153," That's a bit difficult to explain, sir. ",Classic
134939," Ah. Well, that's the way it goes if you will steal other people's property.   What's he talking about, Nyssa? Have you been tampering with the Tardis? ",Classic
145577, What happened? ,Classic
43260, At present power it's steadily losing ground. But we dare not increase. ,Classic
12717, Hmm? What is it? ,Classic
6082," No, that's just it. You didn't think. ",Classic
141921, Do you intend to explode those missiles in space? ,Classic
128781, That's it. We need to take him somewhere uncomplicated. Somewhere away from technology. ,Classic
58138," Hey, hey! That must be a mighty interesting thing to do. ",Classic
72360," Look, fifteen minutes, say twenty? ",Classic
116266, They're a crank organisation. They support these primitives. They want Thawn's company to pull out. ,Classic
103697, How did you find out about Poul? ,Classic
17128," Well, perhaps Vicki, perhaps. ",Classic
163628," Yes sir, but, excuse me sir, as I understood it, you would not be arriving until this evening. ",Classic
163992, Bats in the belfry. ,Classic
103272," Be careful of him, Doctor. He's not what he seems. ",Classic
62834," Yes, I suppose so. ",Classic
44080," Well, without you the Earth hasn't much of a chance, has it? ",Classic
130590, Very well. ,Classic
66978, Where's there to go? ,Classic
52158," We hide in among the trees. Quick! There's a J, there's room for two! Oh, thank goodness there's a letter C. You, sir, aren't you going to take cover? ",Classic
76038, He must have been after the Master. ,Classic
74386, You will stay. I must inform Izlyr. ,Classic
10273," And don't think I'm doing this for you. But if there's one chance in a million of the experiment going through, of making it work, then I must do it. I must. ",Classic
95411, Hmm. And they're coming here at your invitation. ,Classic
68823," Doctor, I've understood very little of what you have been saying. Please, explain more clearly. ",Classic
86046," Well, I did warn you, didn't I? ",Classic
63066, What do you mean? Eh? What do you mean? ,Classic
50925," No, why? ",Classic
124583," But Keara, she's so young. ",Classic
128149, Eight nine. Nine A. E seven. ,Classic
162657, What was that? ,Classic
118602," Across that next rise. Shouldn't take long now.   We could go back, take another way around. ",Classic
21603, Are the fugitives still evading capture? ,Classic
157896," But Chief, you ",Classic
23609," Kings are recognised only by the power they wield. The Queen Mother seems to claim this power. Take care, Your Majesty, that it does not prove detrimental to yourself, and to France. ",Classic
153734, The work units exist only to serve me. Without me they would have no function. ,Classic
33859," Oh, how interesting, yes. Hmm. It's Aztec. Fake of course. ",Classic
42605," No, no, it's not in there. It's further down the corridor. ",Classic
145164, May I? ,Classic
114236, For how long? ,Classic
161729," Doctor who? Have you never wondered where he came from, who he is? ",Classic
161132, Don't you find it embarrassing asking for autographs? ,Classic
75183," Special audit, sir? ",Classic
76241, We should have gone the first time. Come on. ,Classic
156431," Why not indeed. We both are.   A bull in a barber shop. A navigational guidance system distorter. This would force any passing spaceship into landing here. Where are we, by the way? ",Classic
149077," My way. We do it my way. Any idea where those morons you created might be?   Ah, the old mine working. ",Classic
165669, Don't run! Stay still! ,Classic
129536, Tell them nothing. ,Classic
75797," Excellent! Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war, hmm? Well, tell them to carry out their orders. The attack will go ahead now. ",Classic
39072, We are not the murderers. ,Classic
76474," Marshal, I must insist! The experiment has reached a critical stage. I'm working here alone and against time and, with respect, I can't afford to have you or anyone else interfering with it whenever you feel like giving some stupid guided tour. ",Classic
59751," Oh no, we're not back here again. ",Classic
111178, Can you do this? ,Classic
39650, Specific gravity. ,Classic
68234, Farrel? ,Classic
82665, They? ,Classic
130345, Why shouldn't I? ,Classic
144089, It's very clever. Would you care to tell me how it's done? ,Classic
153632," Oh, great Immortal one ",Classic
75405, Stand by to blow Q. ,Classic
15354," Well, they must have missed the old man. Yes, this was put here for him to follow them. ",Classic
123162," There is now.   You see, a common fault with tachyon particles is that they can induce a certain temporal instability in surrounding matter.   What can I do for you? ",Classic
83132," Exactly. And if we can trap enough of it, we might be able to rise with it. ",Classic
34712, Must get breath. ,Classic
82024, What's that? I thought I heard something. ,Classic
36329," Did you protect her, and were there such creatures? ",Classic
61643, You've no idea who he is? ,Classic
87831," Well, get the power back into our spaceships, for one thing. And for another, do everything we can to help that Earth mission ship. ",Classic
68229," Eagle, Eagle, Eagle. Abort, abort, abort! ",Classic
151371, But the Earth woman must be kept alive. ,Classic
28108, Please take your arm away. ,Classic
15312, Captured. ,Classic
113733, I think I'll look him up. ,Classic
82429," Certainly. From the Master. He fed the coordinates into his ship's computer when I was his prisoner. And after you'd captured the ship, sir, I extracted the information from the ship's memory banks. ",Classic
142497, Doctor! ,Classic
59740," Yes, and the guns have stopped, too. ",Classic
55117," Oh, that wore off a long time ago. It's quite safe now. ",Classic
152270, Direction? ,Classic
111152, Little K9. ,Classic
29767, Here? In these parts? ,Classic
127893, Me lucky? You don't think that I? You do think. ,Classic
135913," Yes, perfect. ",Classic
122786, That was merely a warning. Kindly remove me from this surface. ,Classic
88924, Destroy it. Blow the whole place up! ,Classic
132546," I know of him, of course, yes. He writes fiction. ",Classic
95770, Irrelevant? ,Classic
113385," Come on, Doctor. ",Classic
59910, They tricked my human Lieutenant. ,Classic
116281," Good. I want you to fix that pipeline as soon as possible, but killing this creature's got to be our first priority. ",Classic
68134," Yes, these daffodils have their instructions imprinted on every cell. It's a weapon of some sort, but what sort? ",Classic
26973," Please, come with me to the City. Our Elders wait to honour your Doctor. They will be very happy also to welcome his friends. ",Classic
52942, Where are we going? ,Classic
106051, What for? ,Classic
64295, What did you do with the tape? ,Classic
101438, But that is a separate matter. ,Classic
61480," And if any attempt is made to stop us, then I shall kill them instantly. ",Classic
142509," Tegan, my dear. ",Classic
148366, The prison contains too many devices. No one could know or survive them all. ,Classic
137586," It still exists, but if you're so concerned about Turlough, set an example and stay behind. ",Classic
130698, What about Adric? ,Classic
61476," Oh, good. I'm glad to see your sense of justice still prevails.   Even though they've lost their sense of humour. ",Classic
103103, You stay where you are. ,Classic
71041," That's right. Oh yes, it was all very efficiently done. ",Classic
147924," Well, that's not very friendly. ",Classic
28045, True? ,Classic
84070," Whatever it was, it's still down here with us.",Classic
147012," Not quite, Time Lord. ",Classic
132150, Where are they?,Classic
157003, I don't believe it. A time manip. This monstrosity will give you the ability to change the order of creation. ,Classic
11377, I think we can rest here. ,Classic
22587," We want the taranium core back Doctor, and there's nothing you can do to stop us now. ",Classic
101839," Yes, that's all very interesting. Could we hear the transgram? ",Classic
83298, All right. ,Classic
156942, Sentiment has nothing to do with it. Wasting a resource does. Until this experiment is successfully concluded I can't be certain that I won't need them as a labour force. Selective retribution will bring any dissidents to heel. ,Classic
160366, Not interested. Where's your badge? ,Classic
3634, What do you mean? ,Classic
114323," You know, I think this must have been a convict ship. ",Classic
75642," They're all over the place, sir! They killed most of the lads! ",Classic
123738, That's a promising start. ,Classic
130168," Ha, ha, ha, ha! What's the matter, boy? Bad dreams, eh? Look, just a joke, that's all. ",Classic
62725, Let's have a look. ,Classic
81971," Oh, but you are, you know. Believe it or not, I am a fully accredited Commissioner from the planet Sirius 4, and you and the Doctor are two dangerous criminals being handed over into my custody. ",Classic
121585, Good. Let's get to work.   ,Classic
144897, I can stop the Master by materialising around his Tardis. ,Classic
164561," Organ bellows. Come on, let's leave Doctor Judson to his puzzles. ",Classic
158416, My immediate objectives are to set them free and find Delta and the baby somewhere safe. ,Classic
72764," Shaken, I'll admit. ",Classic
48217, Can't fight. ,Classic
44454," Take your hands off me, you",Classic
41734, Shh. She has entered the Sanctum. ,Classic
76964, Then the seasons must be five hundred years long. ,Classic
157077," Doctor, come on. ",Classic
111184, Yes. ,Classic
163556," What's wrong, Doctor? ",Classic
101902," Yes, and the President was wearing it when he was shot down. The Sash won't protect you. It's damaged. ",Classic
15470," We ran so quickly, we went in opposite directions. I couldn't turn back when I realised because the guards were already behind me. ",Classic
142421, I didn't realise that the Malus was so evil. ,Classic
58253," Well, he never did explain how he turned up the way he did, did he? And that Space Corp ship was chasing him. ",Classic
20025, Yes. ,Classic
122318, Soldeed. ,Classic
19342," While the others are preparing the launcher, go and get the Doctor and the girl. ",Classic
37237, Don't worry about him. We have ways of dealing with such people.,Classic
66270, Take him into the office. ,Classic
144795, What are you waiting for? Continue the burnings. ,Classic
144027, What do you think? ,Classic
672, They are coming. ,Classic
73148, The May day miracle has happened again. The Earth is born anew. ,Classic
2504, Chesterton! ,Classic
81219," I think you've lost that, too. ",Classic
60525," You're too late for that. They will be on their way to the landing bay by now, I should imagine. Try and get there before them.",Classic
91027, Concerning this robot ,Classic
91631," Welcome, sister. Welcome to Nerva. No, do not move. It is dangerous to move from the tranquiller couch. Please remain in contact with the biocryonic vibrations. In five minutes, the final phase of your processing must commence. If you have any personal possessions that you wish to have preserved, please place them in the casket adjacent to your right hand. Shortly you will hear the recorded voice of the High Minister speaking personally to you. At the conclusion of the Minister's message, there will be a two minute interregnum preceding the commencement of irradiation. ",Classic
50241, And there's a weekly visit by parties of students to show them the horror of atomic radiation. ,Classic
5494," But you couldn't know where it is. I. Yes, yes, you know where it's hidden because Chesterton told you where he hid it. And now you're trying to throw suspicion on me. Well it won't work. Now get out before I ",Classic
141791, Are the ape primitives in full retreat? Do you control all strategic areas? ,Classic
84654," Everything okay? Well, keep your eyes open, just in case.   Look out, man! Get back!",Classic
129422," Of course. And inadvertently, as a matter of fact. ",Classic
33769," All right then, where are we? ",Classic
25172, A playing card? ,Classic
122188, Master? ,Classic
59830, Sie mũssen mit uns kommen. ,Classic
106385, What if there isn't? ,Classic
129027, He seems firm in his intent. ,Classic
3554, Doctor? Susan? ,Classic
35435, Have you no mercy? ,Classic
19068, Will anyone speak for the prisoners? ,Classic
28076," Oh, no. It feels like it though. I'm so out of touch. What I'd really like is to go to the hottest night spot in town. ",Classic
107875," I'm gratified, Citizens, but there may be danger. ",Classic
140635, What? ,Classic
68250, The Doctor! ,Classic
26593, Charlie? ,Classic
19273, You mean of the humanoids like yourself. ,Classic
18820," And here's a monitor. Look, that's a Locust. There, what did I tell you? ",Classic
96398, Look.   Is this the face of Sutekh? ,Classic
25877," Well, there's a guy called Seth Harper. ",Classic
165668, Help me! ,Classic
112476, She won't materialise. ,Classic
101734," But the circuits are blowing. If there's a fire, the whole panatropic net, thousands of brain patterns will be destroyed forever. ",Classic
148479," A student of science, much interested in primitive nuclear technology. ",Classic
90931, What's the hold up? ,Classic
12945," Well, then, how are you going to get out of the concert this evening? ",Classic
57568, Got a good turn of speed for a commercial. ,Classic
99787, A most uncommon spy.   {Temple] ,Classic
66511, We could do with some plain old fashioned luck as well. Where's the Director? ,Classic
68703," You'll be in this cell until sentence is carried out, Mailer.",Classic
101509, Are you quite sure of that? ,Classic
76877, The Marshal. That's the exits. ,Classic
95716, As I thought. ,Classic
106354," Look, I came to see the Doctor. I arrived with him. ",Classic
88970, He threatens to blow up the Citadel. I've got to stop him. ,Classic
163402, This is true. I cannot break such an enchantment. ,Classic
17117," Doctor, they made it! They made it! ",Classic
83425, It's back this way. ,Classic
93611," I don't understand. You see, Davros tricked me into giving him the names of the group who were plotting against him. Have there not been mass arrests by now? Executions? ",Classic
79211," Right, Jo, Doctor, have you seen the Brigadier? ",Classic
128268, You're destroying everything. It may already be too late. ,Classic
115118," Oh, well, if she's there, he'll find her. ",Classic
149571, Put that away or I'll use this. The Doctor said you'd try to hypnotise me. ,Classic
89451, A couple of refugee Tibetan monks setting up a lamasery in darkest mummerset? ,Classic
129522," No, of course you're not. ",Classic
94665, You came very close to being their destroyer. ,Classic
59856," It's the same with the British, remember. ",Classic
42608, Good. Well? ,Classic
67056," We helped him. we've every right to go. I'll give you until three, Doctor. One ",Classic
15355," No, I don't think so. They'd have come back and looked for him. ",Classic
102493," All right, I didn't think you did. ",Classic
56811," Well, this one looks all right. ",Classic
136441," I, er, where's she taking us? ",Classic
28257," You, Krimpton, will work upon a suitable electronic programme for the new mobile computers. They must be able to move freely and contain their own power. All computer systems throughout the world must be integrated in WOTAN. ",Classic
152464, He doesn't care about Tranquil Repose. He's already turned it into a breeding ground for Daleks. ,Classic
12172, Vicki! ,Classic
23214, Fool! To allow the meddlesome Viscount de Leran to stop you! ,Classic
127331, The strangers must die. Tremas will be of use. ,Classic
28261," Look, love, I really am sorry about your friend not turning up, but I've got to lock up now. You can hang a note on the door if you like. ",Classic
12979," Oh, they'll appreciate that, Caesar Nero. ",Classic
62214," He was coming with us but, unfortunately, he disappeared. ",Classic
87669," Well, I'm not too sure myself, but neither of you is very popular. The Doctor attacked their High Priest. From what we can gather, that's about the worst crime you can commit on this planet. ",Classic
16752," No, no, no! ",Classic
156536," Well then, find her, you incompetent fool! ",Classic
30482, I see. Contact us if you have any further reports on this new planet. ,Classic
72637," Well, it's a simple enough question. Over.",Classic
27676," Right. Chal, take this fellow up into the bushes. We don't want anyone to find him here. Then wait for us. ",Classic
3282, As long as that? ,Classic
79620," I just don't believe it. This is matter. I can see it. Why, I can feel it. ",Classic
81061," Oh, I'd wager on it. He's got the measure of these grey faced idiots right enough. ",Classic
133620," Oh, it is. ",Classic
84880," Now, wait. BOSS! BOSS! Now you're being illogical. If you destroy me, you'll destroy your bargaining power. After all, I'd make a good hostage, wouldn't I? ",Classic
123264," Can I help you, Mister Stimson? ",Classic
43685," Come on, run. ",Classic
154815, A friend of yours? ,Classic
42792, Data readings from the other bases. ,Classic
62650," No, there wouldn't be. ",Classic
6940, Yes. ,Classic
145554," This delightful process you describe so graphically, how long does it all take? ",Classic
16949, Your spaceship? Is it serviceable? ,Classic
29939," Aye, aye, Captain. Get to it, lads. ",Classic
140183," Father, they hatch plots. ",Classic
89330," I have just heard from Federation HQ. The war is over. Once Eckersley and Azaxyr's scheme had failed, Galaxy Five became most anxious to negotiate a peace treaty. ",Classic
37352, What sort of bother? ,Classic
102238, Where's Leela? ,Classic
20066," Well, yes, but, only in a general sort of way, you see. You see, when I first challenged you, little did I know that you were indeed the Lion of Troy. ",Classic
34885," Look out, here I come. ",Classic
93123," Yes, sir. ",Classic
15265," We were facing from there, down here, therefore ",Classic
160146, No!   Now! Run! ,Classic
146777, Is this the Earth girl you say you killed? It seems you have not done so well after all. Where did you find her? ,Classic
95755, Oculoid tracker launched. ,Classic
55788, As much as he can. ,Classic
153626," The guns, Broken Tooth. ",Classic
20373," Oh, that doesn't matter. She's completely discredited. If even the end of the war can't cheer her up, she's not worth bothering about. Well, come on. Father wants to thank you himself. ",Classic
1694, I see. And this? What is this planet? ,Classic
163852," Doctor, where are you? I want to talk to you!",Classic
158951, Look out! ,Classic
86569," Yes, I sincerely hope so. Aren't you the chap who started the 'Save Planet Earth' society? ",Classic
69128," All right, all right. Charlie! ",Classic
149603, It's our speed. It's increasing. ,Classic
134950, And what will you give me? ,Classic
77744," There you are, Charles. It may seem churlish of me after eating your excellent lunch, but how the institute can afford pheasant, I really don't know.",Classic
155223," I did, sir. ",Classic
87689, Substitute weaponry functioning satisfactorily. ,Classic
22985, Then destroy it! ,Classic
156702," Yes, perhaps I am, because if you're the Rani, I'm dicing with destruction. ",Classic
134742, The Doctor destroyed the illusion as soon as we landed. ,Classic
58917, Yeah. ,Classic
30980, Yes. ,Classic
83491, Halt!   Surrender! Surrender or you will be exterminated! Surrender!   Surrender or you will be exterminated! ,Classic
29606," Yes, because he has them prisoner. ",Classic
127418," Oh, dangerous thoughts, Tremas. Dangerous thoughts. Look, Adric. Warp crossover connected there, shutdown element there and ",Classic
66041, No. ,Classic
24828, It's moving! ,Classic
50725, I find it at variance with what we already know. ,Classic
2311," We split ourselves into groups, but without the Doctor we didn't know what to look for. ",Classic
13446,   No. ,Classic
114073, Brilliant! ,Classic
145150, I'm pleased for you. ,Classic
61595," You're wasting time, Doctor. ",Classic
43179, But if you do that my body will explode. ,Classic
131617, We must wait for the Doctor! ,Classic
117895, Affirmative. ,Classic
126176, What is it? ,Classic
42369," Is this what you call your full co-operation, Arden? How do you expect us to carry out this ",Classic
104469," Merely reasonable. Tonight, incidentally, I shall be appearing without Mister Sin. ",Classic
33942," First, release my friends. ",Classic
154364," It's all right, we're alone now. We can talk. ",Classic
142526, I's going to die. ,Classic
136171, Well? ,Classic
84955," Gently, Mike. Fight it. ",Classic
39376," Jamie, Doctor. ",Classic
149347, Eager to show off his latest engine. ,Classic
121423," Ah, Doctor. Doctor, Rigg has told me about the drugs. ",Classic
67196, That was a brilliant idea of yours. ,Classic
41824, She'll go out of her mind. ,Classic
114244," Well, of course it'll work and even if it doesn't work, what does it matter? You know what they say about hyperspace. ",Classic
156693, I am Mel. Who's the Rani? ,Classic
125152, He saved our lives. You'd better keep this for him.  ,Classic
61926, Ah. ,Classic
110000, The greatest honour Gallifrey can offer. ,Classic
134517, Just help me. ,Classic
154694," Mmm hmm, you have strong feelings for the woman. ",Classic
159753," What was he doing, anyway? ",Classic
162215, Maybe they were always here. ,Classic
38708, I have always been fascinated by the concept of travelling through time. Waterfield here is an expert in certain technical matters and I have the money to indulge my whims. Everything you see about you here was constructed by us two. ,Classic
66890," Well, since there's nothing here now, what are you still hanging around for? ",Classic
87173, Did she tell anybody? ,Classic
118450, Never mind. Can you do it? ,Classic
50600, The selector's a bit warm. Soon reach the ceiling. It'll be all right when we level off. There you are. Sit back and relax. Won't take long. ,Classic
26911, Doctor! Doctor? ,Classic
27393, But that's out of the question. ,Classic
26649," Go get 'em, and fast.   Yeehoo! ",Classic
94193," Yes. Keeps in touch with his masters. What have you done with the pentalium drive, Professor? ",Classic
54767," To stop these signals, we have to destroy the Cyberman spaceship. ",Classic
145531," He's kidding, isn't he? No, I guess not. ",Classic
98607, I don't believe it. It's not possible. ,Classic
56774, We won't take any chances.   That should hold it. ,Classic
110468, Yes. ,Classic
133879," Although the freighter is spiraling backwards in time, it's still locked on to the same spatial coordinates. ",Classic
25742, I will not come out and make that final move. ,Classic
38037, Well it should be with the others. ,Classic
133089, You think so? ,Classic
10612," Hmm, I'm so thirsty. ",Classic
143233," Carcasses are plentiful on Frontios. There had to be a corpse, just to keep public order. ",Classic
120678," Now, if my deductions are correct. ",Classic
132682," No, lad. Two are enough. ",Classic
160382," First of all, I'm a killjoy, and secondly, I don't like the prize. ",Classic
68489," No, Professor Kettering, because of this machine. ",Classic
34802, Any sign of the Doctor? ,Classic
123272, Hold it there. ,Classic
85054, Could it have been something it ate? ,Classic
125539," No. What is, is wrong. Look, societies develop in varying ways. Yours just seems to be sinking back into some sort of primitivism. Wouldn't you say so? ",Classic
143082, So here you are. Is he all right? ,Classic
35170," If we lose that hurricane, Mister Hobson, all hell will break loose on the Earth. I've a wife and family. ",Classic
151522," It's a long story, Herbert. No time to tell it now. ",Classic
20234," I'm sorry, Cressida, but I must obey orders. ",Classic
151895, Sensors indicate a disturbance on level seven. ,Classic
11972," Well, for once I'd agree with him, Barbara. If there are any of those crew members left we should get in touch with them. ",Classic
143969," They'd kill anybody, even if they need them. ",Classic
118282, You know something? You've got all the makings of a first class navvy. Concrete. Manufactured.   Look! The ruins of a city?   Come on. ,Classic
97036," It's stuck!   Doctor, what did you do? ",Classic
124257, Stop the sacrifice! Stop it! ,Classic
110030, Do you swear to follow in the wisdom of Rassilon? ,Classic
44002," You will soon see that I am right.   Oh, you will stay, huh? Have a drink. We have a great deal to talk about, you and I. Fariah, see to him. ",Classic
157934, An emergency supply of what? ,Classic
49241, Why not? ,Classic
132891, They were also the most successful creature ever to inhabit the Earth. ,Classic
29574, I can tell you that without cards. Death! ,Classic
34380, You discredit the mystic power of Amdo? ,Classic
39776, Down there. Help them. ,Classic
145029, I'll see you back at the Tardis. ,Classic
29223, But we're not the only ones. What about the geezers who kidnapped the Doctor? ,Classic
138977," Living like lords they are, back there. Every luxury. ",Classic
123239, What? You blind idiot. ,Classic
90474," A little, sir, yes. ",Classic
118650, We obey.   The workers have been released. ,Classic
90299, Why do we wait? We're ready. ,Classic
53139," Jamie, yes. ",Classic
83294," I don't know. We've heard them before. Never seen them. Latep, take first guard. Doctor? ",Classic
143779," Yes, although casualties were very high. ",Classic
75875," Sir, we've stopped moving. ",Classic
77756, A series of minute present moments. ,Classic
32950," Look after him, mate. He'll be all right. Okay, mate, okay. Take it easy, take it easy. Sit down.   A right rat hole this is, isn't it? ",Classic
129006, Let's take them back to the Doctor's room. ,Classic
47703," Well, the faults not this end! It must be jammed at the base. ",Classic
99555, That's very clever of you. ,Classic
124734," Gently, gently. Can't you see it's terrified? ",Classic
129775," The exchange of two fantasies, your Majesty. ",Classic
92527," Oh, thank you.   Thank you.  ",Classic
48675, Get some sleep. Don't argue. Leave it to the relief. ,Classic
35120, So we all thought. ,Classic
77156," Well, whatever we do, we're bound to leave a few bald patches. ",Classic
39331, Friends? ,Classic
108303," Thank you, gentlemen.   Nice to see you both. Where's Leela? Well, where is she? ",Classic
17267, I most certainly am. ,Classic
33966, What? ,Classic
163978, Set me free. ,Classic
84626," And, Doctor? ",Classic
121482, Test an old theory of mine. Come on. ,Classic
36639, You must be mad. You'll be locked up. ,Classic
19367," Er, no. ",Classic
93796, I understand. ,Classic
136853, I don't know. ,Classic
76527, I'm sorry. My people know Earth men only as Overlords. It's difficult to think otherwise. ,Classic
83099, This shows where the Thals have concealed their explosives. Take a patrol immediately. Locate explosives and destroy. ,Classic
92465," Ahoy there, Doctor. Yes, we're fine, thanks. ",Classic
141961," Or your friends. Either way, shouldn't we help them? ",Classic
34214, But this is child's play. What has this to do with Zaroff's project? ,Classic
57632," Something? Well, what do you mean by that? ",Classic
44924, I thought you were going to take us to see Salamander. ,Classic
117394, Where did you find it? ,Classic
66660," Not this one, Elizabeth. The other one. ",Classic
95429," No, Commander. The circuit panel is in order. ",Classic
135603," If you cooperate, you will come to no further harm. ",Classic
1999," There are four roads that lead off from the main square, going north, south, east and west. ",Classic
19661," Oh, but in your name. ",Classic
99397, You cannot go in. Sir Colin is in conference. ,Classic
117166, Certainly. ,Classic
101769, So you killed him? ,Classic
128074," Ah.   Monitor, I must ask you a very special favour. ",Classic
39378, We must go now. We are called. ,Classic
8093, The Doctor's coat is outside the aqueduct. You are lying. ,Classic
93406," Doctor, somehow we've got to warn Mogran and the other Kaled leaders. ",Classic
61418, Where are we? ,Classic
7083, Are there Sensorites in there? ,Classic
164580," I like watching the sea. It makes me feel so small. Oh, you'd think people would take their rubbish home with them, wouldn't you? ",Classic
6908," Suffocation, Doctor? ",Classic
138007," I've had enough of children, what with that awful school on Earth. ",Classic
121128, None of them could explain Secker's condition. ,Classic
124382, It's beyond your comprehension. ,Classic
107013," What, Fendelman and that lot up at the Priory? ",Classic
25447, Soldiers never apologise. It's a rule. ,Classic
1484, Surely it would see you. ,Classic
20295," My Ithacans, and the Doctor, of course. ",Classic
39631, Your own? ,Classic
44048, What? If only I knew what he wanted to talk to me about. Would you know? ,Classic
2574, Precisely. I know now who's responsible. You are. You sabotaged my ship. ,Classic
115321," Good. I shall have to go alone, of course. It's funny, they always want you to go alone when you're walking into a trap. Have you noticed that? ",Classic
44550, But I'm afraid this still isn't evidence. It's not real evidence. ,Classic
28956, Pike's hook? What's that? ,Classic
11887, It can't be the ship. ,Classic
49721, What do we do? ,Classic
35975," I don't see things, Questa, you fool. There are things. Horrible things. Creatures infesting this camp at night. ",Classic
148751," I see you have a keen interest in the flora of Varos, Doctor. ",Classic
12480," Oh, yes, I'd love one. Thank you. ",Classic
34772, Right. ,Classic
79695, I really wouldn't advise it. ,Classic
23986," Oh, well, I'm afraid I can't help you. No, you must run along and phone the police somewhere else. And the same time phone for an ambulance. ",Classic
136998, Am I dead? ,Classic
39086, Victoria! Victoria Waterfield! You know my name! ,Classic
151322," Since there's no time to take you back, it looks as if we're stuck with you. ",Classic
148985, Leave them? They tried to kill the Doctor. ,Classic
10740," All right, you lead on. ",Classic
36377, You will forget all that happened. ,Classic
35894," Go on, Ben. ",Classic
163987, After this I'll get a job at Sellafield. It'll be safer. ,Classic
101929," Look, the Master. ",Classic
163279, Doctor! Bambera and Ancelyn are alive. ,Classic
136772, I thought we'd cleared that up. ,Classic
69474," Oh, Benton? ",Classic
43416, Good. ,Classic
133541, Where do these Cybermen come from? ,Classic
144141, I must have played truant that day. Or maybe we didn't go to the same school. Which school did you go to? ,Classic
18580, We are still alive. It depends how long that machine will be. You failed in your mission of patrol. ,Classic
72935, That's amazing. ,Classic
138519, Do you know how? ,Classic
56611, Hello Moon rocket. Can you hear me? ,Classic
66217, You're just wasting time. ,Classic
61956," I don't find that funny. Without this machine, the Doctor's stuck. He can't leave Earth. ",Classic
99134," Yeah, Keeler. Very clumsy of him. Where's the girl? ",Classic
77960," Doctor? Doctor, the crystal's glowing.",Classic
113130," My trophies, Doctor. Feast your eyes on them, for they represent an achievement unparalleled in the universe. ",Classic
105036," There'll be a huge implosion, Greel, and you'll be at the centre of it. The zigma experiments were a disaster! ",Classic
46540," Listen. Listen, everyone! It's the other Yeti model. It's here! It's somewhere in this room! ",Classic
161511, How can you be so sure? ,Classic
54706," Captain Turner to UNITControl. Come in Control. Do you read me, over? ",Classic
120767, Yes. ,Classic
82881," I just didn't give myself time to think. If I had, I certainly wouldn't have taken the risk. ",Classic
702," They are inside the cave. You see them come out, kill them. ",Classic
41561," Perhaps, but brave men are impatient. And he is no fool. ",Classic
90590, What's he doing? ,Classic
85794, Does he speak truth? ,Classic
93800, Now I wonder where Nyder's going at such a crucial moment. ,Classic
999, Why endanger the rest of us by staying here? ,Classic
55365, Why did you inoperate the dispersion unit? ,Classic
18674," Thank you, thank you. ",Classic
115566, I am. Where are the happy couple? They are in their quarters. I shall inform them we are ready and conduct them here myself. ,Classic
104899, Do things? What sort of things? ,Classic
55300," Eh? Oh. Oh, that's very nice of them. Stay close to me, Zoe. ",Classic
83138," Come on, Doctor! ",Classic
142596," Even if you are, agree, man. ",Classic
160832, It's Trevor here. He has a few questions to ask you. ,Classic
22251," Yes, well, wherever it was, there's still someone on our tail. Here, look at this. ",Classic
164916, But vampires are just superstition. Why? ,Classic
69324," Oh, Stangmoor Prison's a very progressive place. The entire contents of the workshop's at your disposal. ",Classic
64522," No, no, no. You can't ask me to do that. ",Classic
141073," All very interesting, I'm sure, Doctors, but what does it say? ",Classic
39488, Everything I possess is in that house. Everything. What right had you or anyone to destroy it? ,Classic
2204," Sorry. Bad throw, my fault. Move back from the edge. ",Classic
9314," Good. This calls for another drink. Oh, Barbara, just in time. ",Classic
56890, Yes. ,Classic
9635," Please, I come as a friend. ",Classic
142462, Something's wrong.   What happened? ,Classic
35223, Six. ,Classic
164653," No closer, please. ",Classic
22279," Oh, no complaints, no. And you? ",Classic
105516, What? A strong electrical field. Strong enough to kill a man on contact. Interesting. Probably explains the phosphorescent glow. And fish at a distance of several yards. ,Classic
70930," Leave it to me. Oh, by the way, you, er, you will send the necessary machinery? ",Classic
63132," Masters, the Permanent Under-Secretary, is coming down here to conduct a personal investigation. Unless you can impress him more than you impress me, you may well find yourself transferred to some simpler duties, more within your scope. ",Classic
11871," I can't stay, David. I don't belong to this time. ",Classic
97804," Doctor, are you all right? ",Classic
92646, So you better start telling the truth or you night find things getting a little rough. ,Classic
132588, I beg your pardon? ,Classic
143302, I'm terribly embarrassed about all this. ,Classic
47725, So what do you think he should do? ,Classic
106907," Doctor, you did not tell me. Can she really understand what we say? ",Classic
118472, Report. ,Classic
164039, Yes. I fixed it. Uncle Josiah knows as much about it's secrets as a hamburger knows about the Amazon desert. ,Classic
157267, How does she look? ,Classic
153814, Stand back. ,Classic
117015," No, Shapp. No brutality. ",Classic
43884, Sometimes I like to deal with matters in my own way. ,Classic
56588," Yes. Well Mars, as you know, is a cold planet. They've adapted to that. It's heat they can't stand. ",Classic
91916, Doctor! What's wrong with him? ,Classic
36014," He can run, you know. He's got legs. He doesn't have to crawl over the ground. ",Classic
139650, Shall we join them on deck? ,Classic
93361, One of my agents could lead you into the service shafts underneath the Thal city. ,Classic
57573," Sir, I've got another signal coming in now. It's a UHF! ",Classic
150941, Nonsense. The boy is a self-confessed rebel. Banish him. ,Classic
103655, The sensors are extensively damaged. I must report to our Controller. Your orders are to find and destroy all remaining humans. Secrecy is no longer necessary. Confirm. ,Classic
157519, Well? ,Classic
57018," I think they've gone to their ship, but they'll be coming back. We must get out of here. ",Classic
127693," That's one of the questions I was just pondering. There's bound to be an awful lot of fuss about Romana. Why she stayed in E-space, official investigations, that sort of thing. ",Classic
40250, It won't open and I can't make anybody hear. ,Classic
59630," Oh yes, but a great deal falls upon your shoulders, Captain. ",Classic
106580," What? Oh, well, I lost that particular faculty when they kicked me out. Oh look. ",Classic
101373," You're not gold, are you? ",Classic
53177, Hey! ,Classic
94119, Don't let it bite you! ,Classic
34117," Look, mate, do yourself a favour and stop treating us as if we're one of them. Look, Jamie and I don't intend to stop here either. ",Classic
165495, Stevie? ,Classic
44613," A five, progress. ",Classic
109120, Tala? ,Classic
65563, Why don't you use them? ,Classic
15661, Now! It may be too late then. ,Classic
101635," Yes. Trillions of electrochemical cells in a continuous matrix. The cells are the repository of departed Time Lords. At the moment of death, an electrical scan is made of the brain pattern and these millions of impulses are immediately transferred to the ",Classic
124718, We'll go back to the Starliner. ,Classic
119486," Yeah, all seven of them. You know what I don't understand? ",Classic
65784," I can't cut back! The circuits are locked and overloading!   Doctor, are you all right? ",Classic
63258, Electron voltage reading. ,Classic
150138, There was a battle. The knights came and killed everyone. ,Classic
47652," Oh yes, well, that's got the natural iron content. ",Classic
67040, All right but get a move on!   Are you all right? ,Classic
63991, They've jammed the lift. There's no way out.,Classic
89804," Oh, but I am. Without me, you would never have recovered your precious crystal. I've been your friend. ",Classic
136615, Where are we going? ,Classic
1042," Yes. A day's supply for four. That's enough, isn't it? ",Classic
111943," Well, I couldn't let that noble edifice to our cultural heritage fall in the wrong hands, could I? ",Classic
27420, Vapourisation on. ,Classic
85705, My only ambition at the moment is to return to my squadron. You can be of value to me. You can help me to repair this ship. ,Classic
68749," You're late, Captain. ",Classic
77426," Goodbye? Great, innit? He just flashes off and leaves us here. ",Classic
39212, I am tired. ,Classic
76004, Switch the power off!   What happened? ,Classic
100559, That means she does know something about it. ,Classic
9212," Very well, I'll stay then. And I shall say nothing of this disgraceful behaviour, if only for your sake. ",Classic
151067, Vena! Vena! ,Classic
70776, Came from nowhere. Killed everything. I'm the only one left.,Classic
87207, You'll place this man under close arrest. I'm holding you responsible for him. ,Classic
150264, Transference.   Huh. ,Classic
90761," Look here, Doctor. You're not fit ",Classic
9021, D'Argenson. ,Classic
14041," Yes, I'm ready. ",Classic
121327," Yes, no, no, and it doesn't matter what you are saying, I'm going to switch it off. ",Classic
102746, Xoanon! ,Classic
74370," You'll do no such thing, Jo. It's far too dangerous. I'm going to try a little direct confrontation here. ",Classic
132444, Thank you. ,Classic
13459, There are few of us and many of the Zarbi. She offers help. ,Classic
29566," Very well, I will take them with me. Thank you for saving me from these rogues. They will get the treatment they deserve. ",Classic
73960, No! We're asking you to kill one man and prevent millions more dying. ,Classic
2891," Just as you predicted, Doctor, nothing but snow and ice.",Classic
162643," I hate that sound, don't you. Sometimes at night I lie there listening, thinking it might be ",Classic
10675," Yes, exactly. ",Classic
83819," No! No, look it's time to call a halt! It's time that the world awoke to the alarm bell of pollution instead of sliding down the slippery slopes of, of, of, whatever it is. ",Classic
119403, You. What are you doing here? ,Classic
83281, We haven't met properly. I am Latep. ,Classic
127842, I've wondered that myself. I never quite had the nerve to ask them.   Another instrumentation failure. ,Classic
52711, I am at you command. ,Classic
150804, Never mind me. That's Jamie. Help him!   The key! ,Classic
48189," I fully realise that, Mister Harris, but we're old friends. He might talk to me. There's just a possibility that he may know something that could help us. ",Classic
71087," Well, yes, I suppose so ",Classic
98863," Shut up, shut up! ",Classic
124196," No, Doctor, not in the ordinary way. ",Classic
41890, Songsten. He's the link I've been looking for. ,Classic
115333, It won't work. ,Classic
109316," Yes, yes.   [Tunnel] ",Classic
30025, But will you be all right? ,Classic
61669," No, sir. Not a syllable. He's out to the wide. ",Classic
86112," At last, Doctor, there you are. Something most interesting happening here. ",Classic
61832," I honestly don't know, but I'd advise against it. ",Classic
136833, How long have we got? When does the actual ceremony begin? ,Classic
99362, Thank you very much for all you've done. ,Classic
4234, Then it stands hundred miles from Shang-Tu. We are very anxious to hear Tegana's explanation of his master's conduct. ,Classic
16896, Steven Taylor? ,Classic
131456," Interesting, and so is the ornament around your neck. ",Classic
104722, More girls? ,Classic
60520, They were seen here by my men. ,Classic
162470, Another act now. ,Classic
84500," Well quite frankly, Brigadier, I fail to see the value of a lot of idiot soldiers clumping about the place. ",Classic
113197, Never.   Come on. ,Classic
119510," About a hundred million dollars, sir. ",Classic
148012," Marriage to you prepares me to survive anything. Why have they stopped? Oh, it's pathetic. When did they last show something worth watching, eh? When did we last see a decent execution. ",Classic
54811, Let's hope so.,Classic
18077, Why is that that? The Drahvins did say fourteen dawns. ,Classic
149575, Keep your hands by your side. ,Classic
111313," Well, only a guardian could   Oh, I see. Well, in that case, sir. ",Classic
96362, Inventing the radio telescope forty years early. ,Classic
113625, I thought you'd be pleased. ,Classic
49849, A force field has been set around the Operations Control room. How is it operated? ,Classic
60418, Yes? ,Classic
134265, To your work! ,Classic
120281," It may be pretty to you, but it's the very devil to live in. No metal means no tools. ",Classic
106553, It's the reject.   Leela. Leela. Bring me the Doctor. ,Classic
90165," No, he's not.   What should we do? ",Classic
6585," Great Spirit, the penalty is set. The offender must be publically scourged and ridiculed. ",Classic
95113, Murdlar has been eliminated! Immediate molecular dispersal! He must not be taken. Immediate dispersal! ,Classic
34748, You look after yourself. ,Classic
162881," Oh, and Lavel? ",Classic
48975," I don't know. Quite a mystery, isn't it. ",Classic
122113," Ah, pleased to see you. ",Classic
45613, Great stuff. ,Classic
56239," Nothing, but you're doing rather more than that, aren't you, Daniel. ",Classic
120196," Organon, sir. ",Classic
49638, Central Control. ,Classic
73057, No! ,Classic
86450, I'll thank you to stop interfering ,Classic
301, Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking about? ,Classic
95552, Sorenson wouldn't come. He. Braun? Where are you? ,Classic
128908, Shardovan was detained by being longer in the body than the available habiliments could match. ,Classic
90231," One is only frightened when there's hope of rescue. We have no hope left. We are dead, my child. ",Classic
44960, Dead? ,Classic
24797, I'll stay too. ,Classic
118137, Yes. ,Classic
124595, No! ,Classic
125114, Suppose it doesn't work? ,Classic
84761," Yes, yes, I know. That's obvious. But have you been able to get a hold of any of that waste? ",Classic
149400, But you ,Classic
72007, No! ,Classic
80885," Are you sure it came from here, sir? ",Classic
119236, There's only one match. ,Classic
42938," Can you describe them to us, Victoria dear? ",Classic
163390, Take no prisoners. ,Classic
94235, Be? ,Classic
116473," Then kill me, but you're not going to kill the others. ",Classic
8174, Yes. He was certainly pretty odd with me. ,Classic
156670," I, I had to be told. ",Classic
15813, What about the aliens? ,Classic
141134," Yes, I'm here. ",Classic
101679," All right, I'll fight you in your reality. ",Classic
101354, Fifty two floors. Nothing. He never left the lift. We think he doubled back. ,Classic
106520," Yes, certainly, certainly. K9, cooperate with Leela. ",Classic
164445, House guests leaving the nursery. Wait! Something's wrong. One of them's a girl.,Classic
65942, The Doctor believes there is some connection between the ,Classic
31001, Did you all hear that? ,Classic
32886," Oh, no, no, you start. I don't want to lose all my fillings. Teeth. Doesn't matter. You start. I'm not hungry, really. Got to make a plan. We saw them being marched away. Now where would they be taking them? ",Classic
374," It's his notes. He'd never leave his notebook. It's too important to him. It's got the key codes of all the machines in the ship. It's got notes of everywhere we've been to. Something terrible has happened to him, I know it has. We must find him. ",Classic
19595, We have found the bomb. We must warn them immediately. Come along. ,Classic
84293," You are mistaken.  (Fell goes into a nearby room, which controls the pumping operations. He takes a clipboard from the wall and sits at a console. Elgin sneaks in and hides behind some large vertical pipes to watch.",Classic
100129, [Hieronymous has gathered the believers.) ,Classic
52852, Please let me answer one question at a time. ,Classic
120202," Why, are you in the business yourself, sir? ",Classic
113732," Oh, he lives over the hill in the big house. ",Classic
36544, Jamie took those keys. I must report him.,Classic
147514, You got a better idea? Then get started. ,Classic
24916, There is nothing there. Do you understand me? There is nothing there at all. You must believe me. ,Classic
99348, Too dangerous. I wonder what has happened to Dunbar? ,Classic
130428, Fear. And hurting. And confusion. Where is my brother? ,Classic
107225," What happened, Gran? ",Classic
160432,"   Mmm, Fondant Surprise. ",Classic
61542," Oh come on, we've been in tighter situations than this. ",Classic
35557, What about those poor men? ,Classic
149389, See if we've misjudged the Rani.   Dichlorodiethyl sulphide! ,Classic
10674, Yes. If they don't ask what a police box is doing under a bridge in the first place. ,Classic
46307, No. ,Classic
95837, Do you ever get tired of being pushed around? ,Classic
92105, That's right. Some sort of space creature. ,Classic
73411," We're wasting time, Anat. Here, I'll do it. ",Classic
51951, Four. ,Classic
60279, That must be the Security Room. ,Classic
95407," Well, it's the only way to learn. When does this great operation begin, this conquest of the world? ",Classic
40371, You will be. ,Classic
97045," It's not a fault, Styggron, it's a remarkable success. ",Classic
55921," Oh. Oh Doctor, I wanted to stand there. ",Classic
117800," Yes, very tricky. ",Classic
31521, Are you sure? ,Classic
149943," Well, maybe someone's setting the Time Lords up. ",Classic
63053, I thought you were going straight back to the research centre. ,Classic
110597," Yes, sir. ",Classic
17077," Well, you haven't been very successful, have you? ",Classic
113091," Trivia, Mister Fibuli, trivia. Have the guards managed to open his vessel yet? ",Classic
19429, Then somehow we shall have to find out. ,Classic
105899, Then there is nothing we can do. The maroons. ,Classic
87235, I'll get on to International UNITHQ. They must put pressure on the government. ,Classic
22927, I will verify my orders. ,Classic
31059, What's it weigh then? ,Classic
140630," All this was the setting for the games. But old Rassilon put a stop to it in the end. He sealed off the entire Zone and forbade the use of the Time Scoop, until now. ",Classic
163283, Yes. Bambera's own unit is there. ,Classic
5172, Sabetha's chain. ,Classic
52967, Yes sir. ,Classic
119150, Furore. The whole art word in an uproar. ,Classic
60540," It's not very difficult, Zoe. Now the doors.   Come along. Don't be afraid, you've gone before. ",Classic
124453," Well, there's nothing more to discuss, then. We have to go. ",Classic
16960," Yes, I see why the Mechanoids don't mind us coming up here.  There are coils of thick cable.)   Doctor, what do you make of this? ",Classic
151069, I feel as though I've been put through a blender.   What was that? Or did I imagine her? ,Classic
11550," How do you manage? For food, I mean? ",Classic
17835," Well, I've finished chopping this fellow. Could we go out and see? ",Classic
33301, You scurvy swab! ,Classic
104856, Take my advice. Don't. ,Classic
130064," Yes. All right then, yes. ",Classic
103083, Give it to a robot. ,Classic
3762, Then we shall watch for it.,Classic
76235, Hello? Hello? ,Classic
3519, What cave? ,Classic
25681," Tell them the truth, Doctor. Hide nothing. ",Classic
160387, The joke's not much good either. ,Classic
51870, Follow them. Follow and save them. ,Classic
152254, It's creepy. ,Classic
135283, Possibly. ,Classic
66531, Zero minus thirty seconds. Countdown moves to final phase. ,Classic
82011," Well, it was telling my story on Earth that got me sent here in the first place. ",Classic
76923," Marshal, this is not a war. ",Classic
159187, I don't know. ,Classic
95568, Thirty thousand. ,Classic
131040," Isn't it obvious? Your mind and body were occupied the Mara, who found its path to this world through your dream, just as Karuna said. ",Classic
3817," True. He is not as young as we are. Tell the others that unless he signals before the moon's first light, we attack then. ",Classic
161156, I'm afraid there's an infinite number of possibilities. What concerns me more is my alarm. Got to find out what it was supposed to be. ,Classic
30815," But I might. Though if it leads into the rocket silo, would I need a radiation suit? ",Classic
77705, The crystal. It's still glowing. ,Classic
10752," That body. You know, I want to get away from here. ",Classic
92936, Do you mean avert their creation? ,Classic
45835," Quiet! Listen. Quick, get in there. ",Classic
106603, Contact has been made. Master. ,Classic
138344, I tried. ,Classic
85882," Gas? Good heavens, what on Earth do you take me for? No, it was some sort of superior stink bomb with a few bangs and flashes thrown in for good measure. No, it's quite harmless, I assure you, but   phew.",Classic
150570, Chessene!,Classic
6492, I am the witness. ,Classic
94044, Did they identify it? ,Classic
142066," Now, I can perform the manual tasks, but you will have to do the rest. ",Classic
13919, Breathe. ,Classic
108553," That noise, Hade. Can't something be done about it? We shan't hear her. ",Classic
124540, And don't tell me what to do. I've had enough orders in the Starliner. Can't you keep these two under better control? ,Classic
86380, The witch. She's cast a spell on me. I'll tell the priest and have her burned! ,Classic
59217, Take care of him.   Well done. Get inside.   Who are those people? ,Classic
108605, Of course you will. ,Classic
107063," You'll upset the dog. Listen, Leela, you simply must stop attacking people. ",Classic
152357, Is that your real accent? ,Classic
98505," Certainly, sir. ",Classic
14374," Please, your Majesty. ",Classic
129707," Well, take the advice of a mad man and look happy. ",Classic
143405," No, no, Tegan, it's too late! Follow me.",Classic
129612," Well, can you get us out of here? Can you get us back to the Tardis? ",Classic
112311," Firing squad, fall in! ",Classic
135623, That's very generous of you. May I ask what I've done to deserve it? ,Classic
85777," Yes, well, he'd have looked even stranger if he hadn't been wearing space armour. He comes from a planet where the surface gravity is many times than of Earth. ",Classic
117152," I was thinking in terms of a psychological barrier. It's cheap, efficient and energy saving, and it would stop the Zeons wanting to come here. Introduce an element of iatrophobia? ",Classic
77193, Skybase calling Hyperion! Skybase calling Hyperion! ,Classic
104725," Good evening, Mister Chang. We thought you'd gone to join your ancestors. ",Classic
150296," Well, of course, it may not be your department. I can see from your raiment that you obviously belong to the plain clothes branch. ",Classic
128097, What's the matter? ,Classic
140591," But you shouldn't be here at the same time, with him, should you? ",Classic
89320," Oh, your Majesty. You stood up to Ortron, and to Azaxyr and the Ice Warriors. You don't need anyone's help. ",Classic
122763, Ah. ,Classic
17843," From past experience, we must always be on our guard. ",Classic
26621, They was headed for New Mexico. ,Classic
93778,   Good. We have achieved the delay we needed. Wait a few minutes then check that everything is ready. ,Classic
126055, Yes? ,Classic
119508," The moment the news breaks, sir, each of our seven buyers will be ready. ",Classic
28535, Attack? ,Classic
105470, Will I? ,Classic
94376," You'll discover who's mistaken, chum. ",Classic
85078, We've licked them! ,Classic
11575, It's my kneecap. I caught it on the truck as I fell. ,Classic
16350, I really meant what year is it? ,Classic
153510, A few minutes. ,Classic
36198, I'm asleep. ,Classic
128533, Oh yes? ,Classic
88072," Well, what had you in mind? ",Classic
101218, Yes. ,Classic
119163," Well, it depends on what you want to do with it. Uh oh. ",Classic
114687," Oh, I wouldn't go as far as that. Excuse me, gentlemen, I think this belongs to me. ",Classic
94841," Doctor, the destruction of these rigs is a complete mystery. Do you want more men to die? ",Classic
130592, You agree? ,Classic
55417, We can defeat them. ,Classic
50579," Oh, switched off? That's typical, isn't it. Typical Dulcian behaviour. Something strange, something you don't understand and you switch off.   Up here. ",Classic
144318, My escape hatch is prepared.   Now for the Daleks.   I did not summon your assistance! ,Classic
145703, I don't think she's any use to us. ,Classic
165383," Maybe they don't come up here anymore. There's no one around, is there? Nothing but tin cans and stray cats. ",Classic
104947," Doctor, there are two others here. Two wretched girls. ",Classic
135732," Hurry it up, Maxil. I need him. Find him! ",Classic
77646," Check, check, check!",Classic
4464," Look, how are we going to get Ian past the guard? ",Classic
103736," D84, do you know the storage bay where Chub kept his equipment?",Classic
163802," That's no way for a Victorian lady, gentlemen to behave. ",Classic
48205," If you please, Harris. ",Classic
127568," Oh, by the way, by the way, Neman. Neman, come here. You chaps might be interested in this as well.   Listen, do you know that expression, two heads are better than one?   Well, I think that one head's better than three. ",Classic
95448," In two minutes, close down dyastetic transmission and maintain monitor contact. ",Classic
139048, It's dark outside. ,Classic
73132, Stop firing. You'll damage Bessie. ,Classic
32748," Deserter, then. You'll hang just the same. ",Classic
118520," No, Doctor, after you. ",Classic
164950, It's stuck! ,Classic
125117," Forty generations. That's a good round figure. Can't be right, though. ",Classic
86531, Surround it with an electrical field and wait for it to disappear. ,Classic
94932, What's that? ,Classic
147751, It wasn't of my making. ,Classic
41990, These small Yeti models. Their movements must be mirrored by the real robots? ,Classic
88365, On this planet? I don't trust any of them. Right. ,Classic
69839, Axos calling Earth. Request immediate assistance. Axos calling Earth. ,Classic
12238," Well, you see Vicki, our space ship, well, isn't like this one. It travels through time. ",Classic
108367, Zero zero five. Sevateem. Negative report. Semantic analysis suggests linguistic corruption. Inferences degenerate unsupported Tellurian colony. ,Classic
104322, Robbery? ,Classic
123651," Well then, I'm going to be very glad to get back to work. And I'm missing K9. ",Classic
5770, No. The machine will enslave them now. Bring Sabetha and the young man to me. I want them here when the final key is inserted and my power is absolute. ,Classic
59919, Yes. Here we are. ,Classic
36315, The least you can do is to say thank you. ,Classic
66532, Listen to that! ,Classic
89051, We've got to get past him. ,Classic
115411, And these gentlemen? ,Classic
115800, What were you doing out there? ,Classic
57266, But there's still all that fungus stuff everywhere. ,Classic
2241," Well, we still have the torch. ",Classic
6051, No! ,Classic
30130, So you mean we are on Earth? ,Classic
154567, Have I died and gone to the great Plague Halls of Mogdana? ,Classic
24529," Well, I'm afraid the Monoids will make very short work of them.",Classic
39211," Flashing, flashing, like a collection of sparks. But I know you are tired, Mollie. You are tired, are you not? Tell me. ",Classic
8052, Yes. ,Classic
92104, Something got in here. ,Classic
22708," I've no idea. Though I think we might be able to make it on foot. Perhaps I'd better go out and take some bearings. Open the door, dear boy. ",Classic
103459, Irreparable. ,Classic
60495," No, now. or we'll all be caught! Come on. ",Classic
23228, She can't help us any more. You can go. ,Classic
117738," What? I'm sorry, I was lost. ",Classic
128695, No! ,Classic
18314," Get it charged, Three. All guns must be perfect. If any one is found defective, the owner will be severely punished. Because soon now, we will use them. I, Maaga, will see to it. Soon now, we will break into the Rills' spaceship, and the Rills, they will all be wiped out.",Classic
29841," Well now, we've found our three names. ",Classic
19861," Ah, what's this? Who's this? ",Classic
25024," But this is the game we have to play, right? ",Classic
88083," I should never have trusted Galloway. He had one of the Dalek bombs. Could have stopped them with it, damaged their ship. If I knew where he was ",Classic
106103, What does that matter? What's important is that someone needs help. Quadrant six two. WHI1212. 9990EX41.   What's the matter? ,Classic
93991, What have I done now? ,Classic
38340," Yeah, firm name of, er, Leatherman. ",Classic
120524, I'll go with him. ,Classic
115740, How do I cooperate? ,Classic
31982, And why not? ,Classic
150529, The Doctor's companion at the Space Station had a knife like that. ,Classic
80481," Oh no, your worship. The Scope is good, old-fashioned live entertainment. The picture on the glo-sphere is an actual projection of what is now taking place deep down inside. ",Classic
102055, I thought I heard something. ,Classic
135607, The primitive? ,Classic
99495, Look! ,Classic
133972," How about opening day? Pass the time of day with the foreign royals. We could even drop in at Lords, see a few overs from Wisden and Pilch. I wonder if the Lion will be bowling? ",Classic
98227," What happened? Solon, where's Condo? What happened? ",Classic
27523, Look out. The patrol is coming.,Classic
155745," I was just admiring the er, the design. ",Classic
21503, She hasn't come round yet. ,Classic
44846," I don't know. I don't say I doubt him, but just once, Mary, just once I want to see with my own eyes what's going on up there. Me. Not hear about it from anybody else.",Classic
114319, My hand! My hand! I ,Classic
74342," Well, the Ice Warriors of course. It's made from trisilicate, which can only be found on the planet Mars. ",Classic
608, What exactly do you think you're doing? ,Classic
82406," No, let me go! No! ",Classic
51887," Yes, possibly. ",Classic
18655, Oh! What is happening? ,Classic
118300," Yes, you did. What did you find out? ",Classic
151830," Never. Oh, I don't believe it! ",Classic
14958," It's that meddling fool, Leicester. We've got to try and slip through them. Remember, not a sound. Not a sound. In you go. ",Classic
105850," The chameleon factor, sometimes called lycanthropy. Leela, I've made a terrible mistake. I thought I'd locked the enemy out. Instead, I've locked it in, with us.   ",Classic
157129," No, Doctor. ",Classic
51849," Aye. You know, I've got the funny feeling that we're being watched. Do you not feel it too? ",Classic
119520, And the girl? The truth. ,Classic
4274," Get it, Ping-Cho. You're a greedy man, aren't you? And you brought the old lord's caravan here, I suppose, to get money? Well, was it? ",Classic
19287, What's it got to do with you? ,Classic
93804, Now where are you going in such a hurry? ,Classic
21521, Cellular what? ,Classic
42833," Well, at the back of the cave, there's what looks like a metal door in the ice.",Classic
138473, Why? ,Classic
7445," I didn't, Grandfather. ",Classic
110052, Impertinent! ,Classic
47840," Well I asked the Medicare Centre to bring her in. Price? Get Medicare for me and ask how my wife is now. Doctor, I've just seen one these creature things that your young friend saw in the Oxygen room. ",Classic
90102, Nothing. There is no cure. He should be dead.,Classic
129548, I'm not frightened. ,Classic
66257, What do you think you're doing? ,Classic
107928, Shut up. What's your name? ,Classic
53915, Yes. ,Classic
50532," That, I think, Jamie, depends upon what you think I am thinking. ",Classic
71567," Oh, don't be too sure. The Adjudicator's changed his decision. He's on our side now. ",Classic
137394, You will absorb my will. You are to be consumed with my purpose. ,Classic
53070," That long. It only seems about a couple of weeks ago, doesn't it. ",Classic
123422, What? ,Classic
147622, Upset the navigational control. If I can distort the coordinates by just a fraction of a degree ,Classic
77202, Yes. ,Classic
14432, Where is she? ,Classic
60294," Still no message sir, just the emergency signal. ",Classic
102269, He poisoned her with a Janis thorn. Up! ,Classic
158634, What's that? ,Classic
132632, The male nurse was killed. ,Classic
41141, Khrisong is a rash man. He was so sure that this Doctor was a threat to us. ,Classic
32425, What have you brought me in here for? ,Classic
150232, The Do�a Arana knows nothing of that. There was very little in her mind to absorb. ,Classic
12098," What's that, my boy, What? What's that? ",Classic
23623," You do not understand, young man. The Abbot is saying his office. ",Classic
78763, Where is she? ,Classic
63342, Is your species the only intelligent lifeform? ,Classic
131534," Well, you only build a staircase to lead somewhere. ",Classic
42041, Looks as though we'll just have to sit tight. ,Classic
58425, I thought you were decoys. ,Classic
137043, I'm afraid it's much more serious than that. ,Classic
134330, The place is deserted. ,Classic
155607, I don't care what you heard on some mythical tape. ,Classic
26879, Neither would Masterson. ,Classic
80910, What? ,Classic
112377," Oh come, my boy, don't be downhearted. We haven't done too badly. ",Classic
102230, Attack! ,Classic
29696," I heard them speak, Captain. They said about going to see the Squire. ",Classic
50314," Well, is the whole island as dreary as this? ",Classic
149999," Just far enough to scrape the skin off another leg. What is all this stuff, anyway? ",Classic
156627," If he's in there, I probably never will. ",Classic
91905, Explain. ,Classic
16708," Well, I should imagine it's some kind of weapon. Just hold that a minute.   Ah, cha, cha, cha, not so close!     Well, that's ingenious, isn't it? ",Classic
12721," I am Tavius. There was trouble, but I settled it. ",Classic
100618, Sarah. Keep her talking. I'm going in there. ,Classic
99137," Franklin Adams, 1881 to 1960. American humourist. ",Classic
37570, That's the wall the gas-nozzles came out of. ,Classic
107611, Here you are. That's all the salt I can lay me hands on. ,Classic
72796," Don't worry. The Doc'll be here soon, and Benton knows we're here.",Classic
30384, About 230 miles. ,Classic
6785," Cameca, I must speak with you. You are sad, Cameca. ",Classic
40072," Sequence, how do you mean? Oh, you mean these! Oh, well, I just pressed that button and pulled this lever and then that lever there. ",Classic
88268," Our whole technology is based on it. Electronic circuitry, heat shields, inert microcell fibres, radionic crystals. And whoever the supply of trisilicate will win this war. ",Classic
134201," So, this fakir throws the rope up in the air and he and his assistant climb up it. Hey presto, disappeared. ",Classic
46092, Sir! ,Classic
133979, Feedback from the solar comparator? No. ,Classic
53907, You will accept what I say or our partnership is at an end. The invasion will take place at dawn tomorrow. ,Classic
24121, What's that? Do you think somebody's seen us. ,Classic
34713, Lucky it's uphill. Take more time for the water to reach us. ,Classic
38523, But you must tell me. I demand! I'm talking to you! Come back! ,Classic
132026, Can the Terileptil really do what he said? ,Classic
145099," You'll see. Now, when I give you the word, I want you to push this control here hard to its end stop, all right? Now, get down behind the desk. ",Classic
88335," Oh, great. Leaving me to hang about and twiddle my thumbs, as usual. ",Classic
33311," Very well, I shall rouse the watch. They may be interested in two such genteel orange wenches. That's better. Now, to pass the time, what say you to a nice round of whist. ",Classic
162358," Ah, now there's something there, Ace. I saw it when he looked into the crystal ball. ",Classic
112194," That's not polite, is it, Sholakh? ",Classic
111748," In this matter, I'm in complete agreement with you, Garron. How's it going? ",Classic
2174, Right. ,Classic
65293, It doesn't matter what he likes. We've got them. ,Classic
124606, What? ,Classic
42259," Miss Garrett, do so. ",Classic
45669," Eh? Victoria, try and explain to Anne, will you? It's all right, Victoria. You were born. I mean. She was born years before I was! ",Classic
15298," Hmm? Yes, yes, all right, child. ",Classic
32779," A pretty penny, no doubt, sir. No doubt at all. ",Classic
100315,   Have you seen the Doctor? ,Classic
157750," Exactly. And now if you'll excuse me I think I will depart and begin my investigation. In the basement, perhaps.",Classic
149650, Of course we will. ,Classic
38251," Yes, yes, right. ",Classic
102950, Dead! ,Classic
73877, The disused underground railway of the old city. There's an exit right by this wall. ,Classic
73526," Ah, that's the Blinovitch limitation effect. ",Classic
145263, The spineless cretins. ,Classic
121984, Affirmative. ,Classic
126004," Listen, I've got a plan. Can you hear me? ",Classic
18155, To capture the Rill spaceship so that we can escape. ,Classic
128978," I fear we must be a little dull, after the habitual excitements you describe. ",Classic
15194," The children, as you call them, are growing up. ",Classic
75005," Yes, but it didn't catch fire. If it had, the smoke and flames would have been seen, wouldn't they? ",Classic
66028," Nip down to the control centre, will you, and feed these figures into the spare bank of the computer. They're some epsilon coordinates. ",Classic
5551," What? Barbara, do you realise what this means? It proves that someone else was involved. We must tell Tarron and the Doctor, quickly.",Classic
136346," How is it possible?   On the Kinda world, the Mara was repelled by mirrors. ",Classic
47917, I think so. ,Classic
55556," Oh. Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Well, yes, if you put it that way. I wonder perhaps if I were to ",Classic
70221," Yeah, sure. Will one of you Florence Nightingales kindly get my clothes?",Classic
25913, Look I don't know why you wanted to say it in the first place. Steven Regret? What kind of a name's that for a singer anyway? ,Classic
64027, Shall I walk back and get some help? ,Classic
149495," Except on this occasion he didn't go out of his way, did he? You contrived to get him here. Force the Tardis off course, did you? Overrode the controls? ",Classic
147212, No. It's a distress signal. ,Classic
55324," Doctor, look! ",Classic
99293," Yeah, come on. ",Classic
6880," No, I shan't be happy until I've solved this little mystery. ",Classic
147055, You stay here. ,Classic
63881, That is impossible! ,Classic
2605," Frankly, Doctor, I find it hard to keep pace with you. ",Classic
117710, Come on. ,Classic
83313," We'll attack, but this has to be planned. Until it is, we'll wait. ",Classic
1595," Go on, go on. ",Classic
7585, Four. ,Classic
62026, But it will kill him! ,Classic
110984, VIP suite? ,Classic
29640," I know you not, but of your tale and the Squire's, I would rather trust your word than his. ",Classic
77296," Yes, sir. Yes, I would.",Classic
157279," Ohm look at your poor hands. We can't allow that, can we, Tilda?",Classic
156007, Doctor. ,Classic
131550, Not that we've found. ,Classic
136882, Mother? ,Classic
150346, I do not understand. ,Classic
57689, Shut up! I'm thinking. ,Classic
39778, Exterminate. Annihilate. ,Classic
65977," That computer, as I have said, is inaccurate. ",Classic
153105," You enter here, Doctor. ",Classic
32435, The rebels are gathering. We've got them under observation. ,Classic
119220, Long enough. ,Classic
6417, Ixta. I see your strength has been restored to you. ,Classic
956," Oh, did you want something to eat? What would you like? ",Classic
132790, To Alzarius? ,Classic
37486, Where'd you get these? ,Classic
108892," Pity, I've often wanted to know who he was. K9, could you give me a date on that, do you think? ",Classic
149508," A sentiment he'd reciprocate. We stay here, out of sight. ",Classic
103398, I'll give you a hand with the diatrodes. ,Classic
133477, No. ,Classic
115708, There he is.   I think you've hit him. ,Classic
34252, What's that in metres? ,Classic
148399," Who are other people helping rebels? If he should be of another mining corporation, our contracts are ended. ",Classic
153124," Er, this is my best side.",Classic
85636, Hypnotised. Can't get a word out of them. Rotten company. ,Classic
134241, So it seems. ,Classic
87645," But please, we can't leave him here. ",Classic
141620," The Doctor may be right. If he is, these creatures are a threat to all mankind. ",Classic
115116, What? ,Classic
40393," Okay, we'll take a risk. Stand by. ",Classic
55655," Vana, I'm staying here to help. ",Classic
161416, Poor ones. That's our problem. ,Classic
63794, He's dead. Outbreaks of the disease are being reported all over London. ,Classic
88312, Preba. What have you done? ,Classic
102221," The principle's really quite simple. You just move everything forward a couple of seconds inside it. You get a barrier that's impervious to all energy. A true void. I've seen it done as a parlour trick, but never on this scale. ",Classic
88762, It appears that he has gone over to the rebel side completely. ,Classic
109091, I think we've lost left and right ancillaries. ,Classic
78858," But I am the King. Oh, didn't he tell you? Oh, he's a jolly fellow, our friend, Krasis. He loves a joke. ",Classic
148276, Certainly not. What's happened? ,Classic
156519, Hmm? What is it? ,Classic
53303, How long ago did they go in? ,Classic
32837, Set him down. ,Classic
106836, Doctor! ,Classic
98903," It's all right, I'm a doctor. Doctor Chester. Look, we're going to take care of you. Don't worry. ",Classic
161190, Windsor. ,Classic
24711, Yes. One. ,Classic
58469, What's under there? ,Classic
52151, The Master. ,Classic
56406," Yes! But I don't see what good just this emergency link can be. Even if you had a gigantic army of warriors, you couldn't send them all to conquer Earth. ",Classic
79177," Well, some kind of powerful organism thing with a very strong hunting instinct. ",Classic
11342, What are these two men doing here? ,Classic
67118, I'll send for a doctor. ,Classic
92203, I'll come with you. ,Classic
138049, Look! ,Classic
161651," Well, you must be on vacation at this time. ",Classic
96767," He won't find that possible, Sutekh. ",Classic
94753," Hello, Doctor, can you hear me? ",Classic
57671, What's that? Look. ,Classic
44709, When can we return? ,Classic
25841," Oh, something wrong, ma'am? ",Classic
86931," Project abandoned. No further action to be taken. See, Doctor? ",Classic
145139," I shall come from this fire a thousand times stronger, to hound you to the borders of the universe. Bwahahahahaha!   Oh! Cancel the ray injection immediately. Doctor! I'll plague you to the end of time for this. Help me! I'll give you anything in creation. Please! Won't you show mercy to your own Argh!!! ",Classic
29317," Take this, Tom. While you hold it my master will know you and nothing will happen ",Classic
138256, All other must leave immediately. ,Classic
54215, I'm forgiven then? ,Classic
143285, I am the Gravis. ,Classic
160692," If you live here, I need a town and street. If you're an alien, I need a home planet except when you spend more than half the working year away, in which case I need a planet of origin. ",Classic
76273, Exactly. ,Classic
4175, Why did you do that? ,Classic
75228, Miss Grant has just seen a very dangerous criminal on your base. ,Classic
11227, But you don't know him. ,Classic
46717," Evans, I gave you an order. ",Classic
162660, I'm sorry sir but we cannot get a signal out. ,Classic
14335, Not that either. ,Classic
89487, I see. ,Classic
142300, Just do as you're told. Unless you want me to do it for you. ,Classic
156796," You know, Beyus, your collaboration with the Rani's difficult to understand. ",Classic
122387, You are a liar. ,Classic
56710, The prisoner Kelly has escaped. This human was in the corridors. ,Classic
139938," Well, perhaps I can loosen your tongue. ",Classic
127565," Correct, Doctor. ",Classic
19521, What's that? ,Classic
63067, Nothing. I was just referring to the temperature of the room. ,Classic
115574, Just get on with it. ,Classic
95494, Doctor! ,Classic
93944, How much longer can you go on? Three of you doing the work of fifty men. ,Classic
54153," Hurry!   I just don't believe it, sir. All them grenades and he still came out of it. ",Classic
34665," What, in those trousers? ",Classic
26959," A spear. It's sharp as a knife. You were right, Dodo. There is someone up there. ",Classic
14449, What is it? ,Classic
130670," I, er, I can't remember. ",Classic
1717, Tecanda was killed. ,Classic
155716," I haven't been holding out on you, Commodore. There's a audiotape that'll explain everything. ",Classic
163098, Now is not the time to panic! ,Classic
119114," All right, that's enough. Very cleverly staged, but you don't fool me. ",Classic
99276," Mister Chase! Mister Chase, that thing in the cottage, it's a monster! It's breaking loose. ",Classic
6243," Tonight, at sunset, I have to meet another warrior in combat. ",Classic
6440, I've been to the market and obtained food. ,Classic
37341, A friend of that Doctor on the screen. ,Classic
14833," You call yourself a nobleman, sir, yet it appears you enjoy bullying young girls, hmm? We are not the guilty ones here, and don't look away when I'm talking to you. You, sir! ",Classic
63444, You're making a terrible mistake. I can stop you from being destroyed. ,Classic
101341," Oh, and, er, keep me informed about your progress on the conspiracy. ",Classic
163869, I face mine on my own terms. ,Classic
45588," Sir, this Doctor bloke who's in the tunnel. He could have tampered with the charges, you know. ",Classic
21810," Ah, ah, ah. Don't you dare touch that. ",Classic
14550, Really? ,Classic
31137," Yes, we've just getting full power back. The danger is apparently over. ",Classic
6480," Then everything I've tried to do. Oh, I thought I could alter them. ",Classic
165528," Show me. Show me.   Yes, he'll do very well. ",Classic
124223, Stay there. I'll find someone to recharge you. ,Classic
17137, Did you hear that? ,Classic
71831," Yes, and the other guards have returned to the ship. ",Classic
117671," Was she, now. How do you do? I'm delighted to see you. I'm the Doctor, this is Romana. ",Classic
14934," You see? I was right, my lord. You did have gold. ",Classic
157702," Oh, don't I? ",Classic
116904," It would be much better for you to admit everything. I arrested these two myself, standing over the body of the Princess's escort. ",Classic
137351, It is Tegan. ,Classic
24907, What is? ,Classic
51372," Do not defy or question a Dominator. Obey, unless you wish to join your fellow countryman. ",Classic
157618," Red Kangs have an unseen outway, but ",Classic
16028, At present it lies in the Segaro desert of the planet Aridius. ,Classic
66298, And bring the whole programme to a stand-still? ,Classic
115820, We do not understand your dryfoot ways. ,Classic
139606," Well, I'd hardly call it spying. We were welcomed as guests, given the freedom of the ship. ",Classic
132619, What's the idea? ,Classic
42042, Can we not try and join my brothers? ,Classic
119670, I know. I recognise the handwriting. ,Classic
77312, Right. ,Classic
103516, Yes. ,Classic
45313," Huh! For thirty years it stands here in my museum, and now he tells me it is dangerous. ",Classic
56013, The outer door airlocks. ,Classic
7145," If that collision course was their idea of a joke, I'd hate to be one of their enemies. ",Classic
148530," Doctor, I'm sorry. I've tried everything. They just won't believe the truth. ",Classic
137202, Nobody from Earth is just going to walk into a transmat capsule.,Classic
80507, Naturally. ,Classic
94406," Then what is it? You've no home planet, no influence, nothing. You're just a pathetic bunch of tin soldiers skulking about the galaxy in an ancient spaceship. ",Classic
129680, More Earthlings. Hello? Some sort of entertainment. ,Classic
4439," Fetch him, Marco, fetch him. No, wait. Not until our audience with the Lord Tegana is concluded. ",Classic
100309, Is Hieronymous with them? ,Classic
165525, Professor! ,Classic
162422, Could you perhaps give us that old devil moon effect. ,Classic
19636," Why, it must be. ",Classic
102614, Fascinating. Can I ask a question? ,Classic
3878, Marco too? ,Classic
22786," Yes, well, they'd still need guards out here. ",Classic
51419, And the centre bore? ,Classic
95329," What do we do now, sir? ",Classic
134629," But Doctor, aren't we going into this Tardis thing? ",Classic
81122, Of course! Blame it on the Lurman. ,Classic
140310, Yes. ,Classic
81492, Yes? ,Classic
115217," As Commander of His Majesty's bodyguard, it is my decision and mine alone. ",Classic
49557," Oh, I can't leave you on your own. It needs at least two to handle this thing. ",Classic
121299, And you shouldn't have been in that sector. ,Classic
154403," Well, I can recall some of it. Bits of it are beginning to bob back into my mind. ",Classic
6594, I shall arrange it. The two men and your handmaiden shall be there. ,Classic
88022," Doctor, come here! ",Classic
142896," Yes, Doctor. I think I know how to change their minds. ",Classic
59925, Get moving!,Classic
114439, What happened? ,Classic
78095," Nothing, save the crystal and the seal of the high priest. ",Classic
48356," No, sir. They're just approaching the airfield.   Mister Harris, sir. Mister Harris, the Doctor's airborne. ",Classic
48710," Well, where would you like to go? ",Classic
61104, Jamie. ,Classic
139871," You are alive, my friend. ",Classic
36807," Aye, more like the old Ben, I must admit. But you still canna. Where is he?",Classic
30180, An error? Where? ,Classic
130922, Tell me it's a trick. ,Classic
67721, The bomb! I might have killed you all. ,Classic
51637, He was hit by a Quark. Lucky for him its power levels were low. ,Classic
114016," There's an ancient Welsh triad that says, it's a three line poem, umpity, bumpity. Oh, you'll find them in the notes. ",Classic
142557, Now listen to the Doctor. ,Classic
14220," Oh. Oh, thank heaven they've taken that gag away. Umm, I'm so thirsty. ",Classic
155724, Could they? ,Classic
117757, Leave her to Astra. Follow the Doctor. ,Classic
29532," Stand fast, I say there. ",Classic
95002, So now we must make this planet ours. ,Classic
7354," Now listen to me, both of you. You've taken the lock of my ship and I want it returned immediately. ",Classic
97325, Oh. ,Classic
1284, But why should they want the drugs? Surely they must have some themselves if they're still alive. ,Classic
82793, I see. ,Classic
141927, I see. ,Classic
24404," Yes, he says it's a natural compound derived from animal membranes. We only need to take single specimens and then we can release the animals again. But it means that a large scale hunt has to be organised out there in the jungle. ",Classic
91760," Yes, I think she is. ",Classic
124830," Well, that's life, Dexeter. ",Classic
132906, I can't see anyone. ,Classic
33283," Wait! There is, there is another alternative. Thank you, Mister Trask. ",Classic
76311," There have been no shuttles, no departures from Earth, no arrivals on Skybase in weeks. ",Classic
69068, I want an armed man outside this cell the whole time. ,Classic
9743, Agreed. And how do you plan to raise that support? ,Classic
160972," Simple. All we need is someone who knows the streets like the back of her hand. Someone who is a good fighter, and someone above all who is fiercely loyal. Who do you suggest? Priscilla P, perhaps? ",Classic
111359," I'm so sorry, K9. The holiday's off. ",Classic
128891, That has been done. But not his purpose here. May one know that? ,Classic
11821, Barbara!   Doctor! ,Classic
57007, But you said T-Mat was functioning properly. ,Classic
102242, Just as the old ones remembered the last time. The Wall closed up. ,Classic
150005, Doctor! ,Classic
126387," The whole thing's critically critical, old chap. This could be the way out. Now come on, be a good dog and power up.   Come on, power up. Up, up, up, up. Good dog. Now. Now. What's all this about the gateway? ",Classic
135100, Steady. The Dutch are a very civilised race. They don't put people into prison for losing a passport. ,Classic
124000, You are now free to enter the Power room. ,Classic
51622, It's no good. We're trapped. ,Classic
57639," Yes. I've never seen a computer quite like this before, Jamie. ",Classic
117499, What are you going to do? ,Classic
165811, Yes. ,Classic
157035," Oh, that's a daft idea. They're bound to be booby trapped. ",Classic
131894, The warlocks are escaping! Quickly! ,Classic
84200, Right. Okay.   Bert? How can light get down here? ,Classic
85511," It's those accursed walls, walls like these! But with Linx's new weapons ",Classic
105552, What are you talking about? ,Classic
46001," Not me, then? ",Classic
30254, Main tanks are down approximately ,Classic
134211," Look, old chap, this is all a bit of a snare and a delusion. ",Classic
71650, I'm not. ,Classic
26568, No. Could be anywhere between here and Montana. ,Classic
56557, A rocket? But that's impossible!,Classic
60603, Reducing the dimensions further. ,Classic
49684," That what Doctor Corwyn says. He is ill, isn't he? ",Classic
35037," Come off it. I've only just arrived, haven't I? ",Classic
1270, Don't be afraid. ,Classic
27100, Oh no! No! No please! ,Classic
98973, Amelia Ducat. ,Classic
104763, Backs to the wall. ,Classic
62108, Then there was an explosion? ,Classic
88510," No, no, no. Now look, this is all a ridiculous mistake. ",Classic
90376, I haven't had a moment's peace since Lupton disappeared. ,Classic
4595, I could have sworn I heard her. ,Classic
39541, Where? ,Classic
149958," Save us from death by dehydration. That computer's been forced to turn the power on, but it hasn't energized the door locks. If only I could. Ah ha! Here you are.   Now.   Voila! You know, I don't know much about art, but I know what I like.",Classic
45336," Yes, but suppose ",Classic
79537," I'm sorry, Doctor, but I'm afraid I must insist. My place is with the men out there, trying to do something about this, well, whatever it is out there, not standing around here messing about looking for some damn fool flute! ",Classic
16231, The humans may try to reach their machine. ,Classic
109774," Speed is vital, Doctor. ",Classic
77463, The storage area where we left the Tardis. ,Classic
111653," But Highness, a Grade three planet. The natives protected. My clients can't possibly begin mining here, with all the importation of technology that would entail, until Ribos is accorded at least Grade two status. ",Classic
46973," Well, I don't really know how to say this, but there's Miss Travers and Victoria to think of, and, er ",Classic
151306," And when the Doctor returns, make sure you have the Maylin's amulet in your grasp before committing him to the same fate. ",Classic
6494, I hear your words and I rejoice. ,Classic
94187," Please, where are you taking us? We weren't trying to steal your gold if that's what you're thinking. Well, not really. ",Classic
64209," Well, we've got every national radio service standing by with monitors. Wherever that signal's coming from, we'll find it. ",Classic
157559, Fight. ,Classic
44268, Like him? I ,Classic
35602, What is it? ,Classic
53288," Why, they left, of course. ",Classic
46550, Silence! ,Classic
150124, Is it possible? ,Classic
115293, You dare to refuse to speak to a Master of the Sword? ,Classic
79795," Oh look, Doctors, what are you talking about? And simple answers, please. One at a time this time. ",Classic
81056," If not, then you'll just have to take the consequences. Let me know when you've made up your mind. ",Classic
109531, Security. They're driving us back. ,Classic
151214, I also saw that it was on fire. ,Classic
121422, What we have to do. We've got to get inside that machine. Come on. ,Classic
59809, But don't you think I ought to wait for Captain Ransom? ,Classic
79511, Yes. We're at the other end of that light streak of yours. ,Classic
20228, I brought you some food. ,Classic
25939, Now you know you can't stand the sight of blood. ,Classic
44366," Well, I'll be on my way, then. ",Classic
123182, Earth Visitor Hardin thinks that you might be able to help with his experiments. ,Classic
124132," Ah. No. Well, I'll give you one last chance, and you'd better get it right. Move! ",Classic
122016, Put it together again. ,Classic
126077," Well, jump them. ",Classic
6984, It seems to be coming from over here. ,Classic
40632, That does not concern you. ,Classic
90668, You see this web of crystal above my head? It reproduces the pattern of my brain. One perfect crystal and it will be complete. That is the perfect crystal I need. ,Classic
108501, So we let that pressure out. ,Classic
46372," Yes, been wondering how you got here. ",Classic
65976," Come and see for yourself. It warns that drilling should be stopped immediately. Well, look at it, man. Are you blind? ",Classic
130404, I'll keep an eye out for her. ,Classic
47139," Come on, where are we? ",Classic
127576," Come on, through here. Come on. ",Classic
19436, I think I can hear them coming back. ,Classic
38499," I shall find him, sir. Do you want me to go now? ",Classic
101517, Article Seventeen? ,Classic
26105, And the right people happen be your friend Wyatt Earp? ,Classic
131840," The android caught us escaping, and I had to leave her behind. ",Classic
32154," They forget that I control them. I gave them life back again, and now I've taken it away. Finished it, stopped it. ",Classic
139674," Wrack, she's still moving up on us. ",Classic
141700," Yes, we all have an Achilles' heel, Tegan, including the Myrka. Now we must hurry. I must speak to Vorshak. ",Classic
163249," It'll be useless, Brigadier. ",Classic
32473, But we are your friends. ,Classic
103384, Fighting sabotage with sabotage. ,Classic
142004," Yes, all right. Turlough, get the grill open. Preston, fetch that pump. We have to feed the gas into the ventilation system. ",Classic
114727," What about our task? The Key to Time, remember? ",Classic
99910," We have promised you powers beyond all men, Hieronymous, but the time is not yet. Until then, carry our trust discreetly. ",Classic
94252, Just thinking. ,Classic
12530, Caesar Nero's court. The Emperor of all Rome is very concerned for your safe arrival. He looks forward to discussing your music with you. ,Classic
37647," Why, I can move. ",Classic
67742, Can I come? ,Classic
45855," Well, that's it. Smash the pyramid, and you put the Intelligence out of action. ",Classic
2181, Tomorrow the atmosphere will be bombarded by the radiation from our nuclear reactors. ,Classic
48848, No radio contact. ,Classic
151588, It must have made a terrible mess of you. ,Classic
44361," He's not a cook like you, I hope? ",Classic
59760," Look, it is 1917 where we are now on this map. Where we were attacked by the Romans it is two thousand years ago. ",Classic
113544, Fantastic. ,Classic
66234," My dear young lady, if that computer was functioning, it would warn us that we all have very little time left!",Classic
68361, Then why did you insist on coming here? ,Classic
81155, It was during the Great Wallarian Exhibition. ,Classic
67386," Er, Brigadier, my dear fellow, I wonder whether I could borrow a couple of your stalwart chaps to give me a hand in bringing the Tardis back? It's landed in rather an inaccessible position. ",Classic
87842, But we made an agreement. ,Classic
120680," Erato came here fifteen years ago to propose a trading agreement. Tythonus is a planet rich in metallic ores and minerals. Am I not right, K9? ",Classic
147479, I should have guessed when we were attacked by those uniformed policemen. How'd you get onto him? ,Classic
4728," Well, perhaps, if I had to choose, a well equipped laboratory with every conceivable instrument. Yes. Yes. ",Classic
11998, Yes� ,Classic
87012," Whitaker? Whitaker, where are you? ",Classic
155147," Well, that's it, then. End of the line. ",Classic
153724," Oh Merdeen, if the Doctor's right, we're all in danger anyway. We might all die.",Classic
37104," You're right, Jamie. That's quite new. Well, it's good to see someone is using their intelligence. ",Classic
52278, Oh. Oh. ,Classic
87118, Tango one to patrol. Any luck? Over. ,Classic
146900, Doctor?  ,Classic
160643, It's all my fault. You'd have been all right if you hadn't met me. ,Classic
96239, You don't understand the implications. I'm not a human being. I walk in eternity. ,Classic
23804," Anne! Anne, you there? Anne! ",Classic
133291, Earth's on red alert. Some interstellar conference. That's why they're checking that bit more carefully. ,Classic
82765, Anything about? ,Classic
6518, She serves other gods than ours. ,Classic
29102," I don't think I've set eyes on you before in my life, man. ",Classic
61272," There's one thing I don't understand, Doctor. How are you going to get all these people back to their own time? ",Classic
106023, It is fitting to celebrate the death of an enemy. ,Classic
125320," Please, don't shout. Splendid, I'm sure. So you serve the Lords, but what do the Lords do for you? ",Classic
4719, Susan. ,Classic
89680, Goodnight. ,Classic
62507," Well, it's a highly complex piece of machinery. Naturally there are problems. ",Classic
39008," All right.   What're you going to do, sir? ",Classic
77896," I'm sorry, sir, but it's absolutely necessary. Now Sergeant Benton will keep an eye on this machine of yours until the troops arrive, but I cannot be held responsible for the consequences unless you do as I ask. ",Classic
75502," There's nothing wrong with them, sir. There's nothing wrong with any part of this boat. We've checked everything. ",Classic
164023, Shouldn't we follow them? What about Josiah? ,Classic
56642, We can now send to any city in the world? ,Classic
51398, Then he must have escaped. There's no one else on the island. ,Classic
56173," Now, we're not thieves, you know. ",Classic
88477, You betrayed me. You switched on the alarm!,Classic
138000, To show you to your room. ,Classic
145257," That is all, Krau. ",Classic
50619," Oh I'm sure the Director will approve our decision. After all, he considers the Caves of Arick ",Classic
97845, That you were sent here by the High Council of the Time Lords. ,Classic
52541," Well, how long have you been here? ",Classic
28382," Oh but my dear, I thought you were going to show me round London this morning. ",Classic
121719," Affirmative. Sensors indicate that the master is not aboard the ship, mistress. ",Classic
2210, It's too smooth. ,Classic
13406, What's the matter? ,Classic
73550, He's coming. Sir Reginald Styles is coming here. ,Classic
45320," Is it? Yes, yes, I suppose it would be, except for one thing. ",Classic
125172, They've learned to get out. ,Classic
36225, Better some damage than loss of will power. ,Classic
110779," Castellan, is the Chancellor still in his office? ",Classic
128317," If we do cooperate, there'll be no question of you ever returning to Gallifrey. ",Classic
153473," Now the Immortal is dead, how shall men live? ",Classic
99560," Hello, Beresford, this is the Doctor. I can hear you. Over. ",Classic
71089, David! ,Classic
91481, We're just going on a little trip. Would you like a jelly baby?,Classic
90480," Yes, well, I have a strange feeling that you already know most of it. You see, I found a crystal. A blue crystal.  K' ",Classic
105675, Groggy? ,Classic
162616, Sideways in time? ,Classic
65295, There's a vacancy. Doctor Lennox met with an accident at headquarters. ,Classic
152838," Doctor, look! There's something here I think you should see. ",Classic
32351, What about the girl? ,Classic
35023," Well, I was just wondering if I can help, sir. ",Classic
8627," There's another bundle over here. Hey, look at all these maps. There's a whole bunch of daggers down here. ",Classic
32930," No, we're not. They'll soon pass. ",Classic
107059, What is it? ,Classic
48767," No. No, there may be something on the other side. Here.   Here we are. ",Classic
118135," Doctor, are you all right? ",Classic
117205, But Astra said that she couldn't get a signal back from Zeos. Where do we start? ,Classic
139811, Let's get away from here. ,Classic
41789," I have been kept alive so many years, but now our time left is very, very short. Listen carefully. Perhaps you can ",Classic
144168, The Daleks have secured the self-destruct chamber. The station is safe. ,Classic
92631, That's a lie. ,Classic
16931," By taking the humans, the Mechons have forced us to take action against them. We invade. ",Classic
135614, We have trouble. A full-scale security search is in progress for the Doctor. ,Classic
58798, I can't do that. Sorry. ,Classic
160761," You talk too much, whoever you are. ",Classic
152492," I'm perfectly safe. Now listen, Peri. I want you to go back to the Tardis at once. ",Classic
31168," Doctor! Quick, help him. ",Classic
152040," It is to me. They won't torture us, will they? ",Classic
47735," That's it, Doctor. That's the creature I saw back at the Compound. ",Classic
12852," Oh, I'm so sorry, Madame. I wanted a word with Nero, but I'll come back later. He seems to be rather busy. ",Classic
85600," It's a bargain. By heavens, Linx, I never thought when I first saw you that I should come to love you as a brother. Now, show me how the iron man works! ",Classic
146045," Change, my dear. And it seems not a moment too soon. ",Classic
59142," Yes, yes, Maddie. Maddie. ",Classic
84024," All right, love. Here goes. ",Classic
89822," Well, stranger things have happened. ",Classic
69544, I'm scared. It's evil. ,Classic
129427," As indeed are you. You must be tired. Control, refreshments for our guests. ",Classic
83549, Wait! Spiridon slave workers are to report to level four immediately. Move!   Wait! You are not Spiridons! Emergency! Emergency! Emergency!   ,Classic
31043, This is hopeless. We must do as they say. ,Classic
139980, Warmer? ,Classic
55046, Never? ,Classic
76468, Adequate. Not quite what I hoped for but adequate. ,Classic
51976," Zoe? Is that you?   Redcoats. Am I back in my own time? If I am, they'll shoot me down.   Shoot me down like a dog, would you? Well, a McCrimmon's never died without a fight yet. Creag an tuire! ",Classic
119934, There was no need to go to all this trouble. All she had to do was make an appointment. ,Classic
21542, Perhaps they have only just found it. You are certain that there are no natural beings on Mira? ,Classic
113668," I can see that, but what's it for? ",Classic
66003, Shall I tell him or will you? ,Classic
153587, Excised? Why? ,Classic
39263, It's no use having a conscience now. ,Classic
104423," Oh, you wouldn't be knowing. ",Classic
72707," No! No, back! Back!   In the name of the Unspeakable One, back! Nakmia sayamat. Back!",Classic
77045, All vectors cleared. All systems green and go on countdown. Sixty seconds and counting.,Classic
145267," The survey team were charting Blue level, weren't they? Did anyone see anything? ",Classic
58715," Well, how do they work? ",Classic
118734, We function logically. ,Classic
45389, Never heard of you. Who? ,Classic
93065, I wish to see you. ,Classic
61803, In his locker. ,Classic
54798, How long before it strikes? ,Classic
4724, Thank you. Thank you. ,Classic
81372, Who are you? ,Classic
55085," Ever since, we have lived in peace with them. The Krotons never show themselves to us, but we learn from them through the teaching machines. ",Classic
84447, Up the Amazon? ,Classic
161268, Not really. Windsor Castle's a big place. ,Classic
106268, Ireland? ,Classic
55802," Well, I thought you were supposed to be the scientist? ",Classic
154001, That thing attacked us. ,Classic
21117, Where's it landing? ,Classic
137319, What? ,Classic
43735, You mean you don't know? ,Classic
32463, But that's the same thing. ,Classic
154326," Come, let us prepare you. ",Classic
43523, What will that do? ,Classic
73724, My safety? ,Classic
18550, We do not wish him dead. ,Classic
104936," No! No, they were a success! Why, I used them to escape from my enemies. The first man to travel through time. ",Classic
35738," Well, that's all right. We haven't passed any of them. ",Classic
138972, You know where the Tardis is if things get difficult. ,Classic
22207, I obey. ,Classic
151491, Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant! ,Classic
97976," No, Doctor, he's a maniac. He's got a body there. No head, oh no. It's just made out of lumps of things. ",Classic
116931, Then we're trapped. There's no way out. ,Classic
115509, Have you ever known Grendel abide by the rules of war? But who's going to open the gates? ,Classic
53274, Guards! Guards! ,Classic
93895," Goodbye, Bettan. ",Classic
88299," Oh, I'm sorry. ",Classic
136230," She's gone, apparently. ",Classic
132077, You did it. ,Classic
122325, The great pact nears it's completion! The Nimon be praised! Skonnos shall rise and conquer! ,Classic
11966," No. No, there isn't, is there? Well, there must be people or things on this planet. ",Classic
93491," Well, of course, I knew you'd try to get back into the bunker through the cave. ",Classic
93851, I'm going back to the incubator room. This time I'm going to blow it up. ,Classic
51094, Who knows? ,Classic
123472, You mean the Argolins donated cells from their bodies to this Recreation Generator and cloned themselves? There's a flaw in your story. Where are all the others? ,Classic
105473," Obviously I was wrong. The shock simply stunned him, he partly recovered, staggered out onto the rocks, fell into the sea and was drowned. You get on about your work, Vince. There's nothing supernatural going on round here. ",Classic
137470, The transmatting induced a mutative catalysis. ,Classic
71711," Yes, I've looked over it. It's not what I call brand new. ",Classic
61831," Well, is it safe to move him? ",Classic
90251," Who knows? A week, a day, an hour. ",Classic
69139, Thanks. ,Classic
33133," Whist your noise, I'm coming. ",Classic
146060, She is your mother. ,Classic
110942, That will not be necessary.   You are the first president since Rassilon to hold the Great Key. ,Classic
155662," Still not responding, Mister Doland. I've just tried. ",Classic
1693, Yes. Skaro is the twelfth planet. Here. ,Classic

147088, As you wish. Although I think you're mad. ,Classic
75475," Oh, it'll work. Don't you worry about that. Just think of it, Trenchard. You will be responsible for exposing some of the most dangerous saboteurs this country has ever known. I think you'll find that a grateful government will give you anything that you ask for. ",Classic
89964, In the Tardis? ,Classic
45166,"   Never get away with it. Oh, that's good, coming from you. Or don't you realise you're dispensable, and the world is going to get along fine without you from now on.

146156, At once. ,Classic
101903," You lie.  (The Doctor pushes the Master away from the Eye, and replaces one pipe. The Master tackles him, then chases him up the steps, swinging a club or something at him. At the top, the Doctor turns and pushes the Master back down the steps then returns to replace the pipes. The Master tries one more time to stop him, but gets a punch in the stomach for his efforts and goes down. The floor of the Panopticon splits, and the Master falls into the crack. He tries to pull himself out, but cannot get a grip, and finally falls, screaming. The Doctor continues to replace the pipes on the Eye. When the final one is in place, the planet stops shaking and the Doctor takes a deep breath in relief. ",Classic

97720, Can you spare a glass of water? ,Classic
103886," You'd better get your tail pinned on. Linens up in five minutes. Casey, have you got the oopizootics coming on? ",Classic

125161, Yes. Still the manuals in the great book room will show them how to put it all together again. ,Classic
103873," Last week. Levitated her, you did. She's not been the same since. It's done something to her reason, I shouldn't wonder. And she was here last night. ",Classic
90130, Shush! Keep your voice down if you must speak treason. ,Classic
41074, Seize them. ,Classic
87159," Hmm. Well, I think your story needs investigating. Have you told anyone? ",Classic
13577," Don't worry, Vicki. The Doctor's got something up his sleeve. ",Classic
130930, We must help him. ,Classic
43730, Right. ,Classic
130551, Watches. ,Classic
15986, What? ,Classic
158210, How appropriate. ,Classic
16975," Yes, it sounds rather risky. ",Classic
11044," Yes, precisely. Now we've created a force field. Right, now turn the pole round. Give him a hand, quickly. Come on.   Come on. ",Classic
111179," I believe I can, sir. ",Classic
116075," Yes! Rohm-Dutt was with them, so they're obviously all in this together. ",Classic
97609," You were hijacked by the Kraals, Crayford. Nothing went wrong with your rocket, Crayford. You weren't even injured. Take off the eye patch and look for yourself. ",Classic
26768," Fella up there with 'em, name of Steven Regret. ",Classic
136681, Killed? ,Classic
64429, Doctor! Thank heavens you're all right. We found the car. Thought they'd got you. ,Classic
31023," Don't you see, Dyson? It could that they're afraid of radioactivity. ",Classic
79302," Oh, thank you.",Classic
45536, Sir. ,Classic
164297," Gwendoline, who does this remind you of?   Severe trauma. I could forgive her arranging those little trips to Java ",Classic
140972, I won't be a second. ,Classic
27838," Are you all right, Doctor? ",Classic
135645," No, he's operated the lock. ",Classic
149622, Have you ever tried asking the Doctor a question? ,Classic
19672," Oh, did he now? Well, if you notice, I have no beard. ",Classic
41347," It came from the sphere, I swear it. ",Classic
40049," No, I don't expect you did. You'll have to be a little more careful in future, won't you. Now, come along. We must go and see whether Jamie is all right. Come along.",Classic
131975, It created the confusion I wanted. ,Classic
150421," Oh, he said he'd done some operations that had turned her into a genius. ",Classic
118738, Yes? ,Classic
109196," We're through, Captain! It looks like a cavern or a tunnel or something. ",Classic
155163," No! No, look, I'm sorry, madam, I can't explain, but I have a feeling I am being manipulated, that the evidence is being distorted. ",Classic
76734, Varan fears nothing! ,Classic
109032, But you know what they're like. He's just setting us up for something worse. ,Classic
146776, Impossible! She must have died. ,Classic
102249, Thank you. So what do you want of me? ,Classic
59879, Wer sind diese Leute?  LÜ ,Classic
136752, You can't do that! ,Classic
37417," Oh, but surely that's unimportant. If ",Classic
8964, Then I can understand why there has been no call. ,Classic
66263, I was about to take him out and shoot him. ,Classic
49383," It's a possibility, isn't it. Jamie, what do you think? ",Classic
13046," Yes. Caesar Nero made it. The rebuilding of Rome. Let me see, where are we now? 64AD, July. Yes, of course. He sets fire to Rome. ",Classic
100899, I thought so. Didn't I say I thought that was it? I thought ,Classic
111248, But what is it? ,Classic
83911, I see. What do you intend to do? ,Classic
17453," Of course it was. You saw me open it myself. The Monk thought he was in here, too. ",Classic
112844," Come on.   Kimus, I want you to do something very important for me. ",Classic
7855," Oh, he's improving, but he still seems to go back sometimes to that old state of confusion. ",Classic
132135," Will you, please, tell me why we're doing this? ",Classic
116363," By the powers that I hold, I shall learn the truth. But if the dryfoots are not found and sacrificed according to the Holy Ritual, then all my people will suffer the anger of Kroll! ",Classic
47856, There is little time. You know what you must do? ,Classic
158389," Boy, you sure get sore real quick. ",Classic
153910, Said enough? Said enough? I have a great deal more to say. ,Classic
97660," There's something ominous. Where are we, do you think? ",Classic
130510," Nearly, nearly, nearly. I thought that the Kinda ",Classic
23600, How much longer are the Huguenots to suffer these frequent violations of their rights? ,Classic
127, Shush!   Excuse me. ,Classic
68806, What is this? ,Classic
132671," Tell him, Lady Cranleigh, and why he's so interested in Ann. ",Classic
152417," This man you respect now conspires against me. His infidelity is bad enough, but his treason is unforgivable! ",Classic
159426, Fire. ,Classic
120167, I was with the Doctor when he found it. ,Classic
61589," Your appearance has changed before, it will change again. That is part of the sentence. ",Classic
67405, Dealt with it? You've ruined it! ,Classic
112906, What? ,Classic
102744, Xoanon! ,Classic
104395," Sit down, Doctor. The man knows these waters. ",Classic
135502," You must get to the Tardis and fit the element into place. If all goes well, we'll need to leave in a hurry. ",Classic
207," Yes, yes, ship. This doesn't roll along on wheels, you know. ",Classic
77865," You've got tanks there, sir? Over. ",Classic
128399, But the Tardis isn't supposed to do that. ,Classic
10854, Any messages from any other survivors? ,Classic
68330," Well, you're right about the castle bit. It used to be a fortress in the Middle Ages. ",Classic
15301," Shut up, both of you. There's no time for arguments.   Stay here and watch him, Dako, in case he recovers. ",Classic
24621," Nonsense. If the Refusian seeks to challenge me, I will accept it. ",Classic
155699, What are you doing in there? Don't you know how dangerous it is? ,Classic
108138, Gatherer Hade wishes to see you. ,Classic
2597, If it is night. We have no way of telling now. ,Classic
20580, Just a bit. ,Classic
70889, I want to know for certain ,Classic
105829," Well, if you had murdered Palmerdale, everything would have been so much simpler. Unfortunately, he was dead before he hit the ground. ",Classic
101358, Castellan. ,Classic
150714," Oscar, you must stop them. ",Classic
162352, You've sent that poor boy out to his death. ,Classic
83957, Hinks. At once. ,Classic
135853, We'll start with the telephone directory. ,Classic
164833," More than a thousand combinations an hour, with automatic negative checking. ",Classic
130700, Oh! ,Classic
12152," Course I'm right. Just because I lie on that bed all day doesn't mean I've lost the use of my brain. Help me to my room, please.",Classic
16948, We make our way back to my spaceship. ,Classic
131033," That's right. There was this man coming, an unhappy man, a native. ",Classic
70514," Doctor, why don't you give up? You've been working on that thing for simply ages. ",Classic
22358," Continuum stabiliser reading four, three, two, one, zero! ",Classic
147650, Tell them when. ,Classic
162156, And Bellboy? ,Classic
121223," Very handy, that machine of yours, Doctor. ",Classic
110430," Yes. Yes, well, this shielding'll make them suspicious if we stay out of sight too long. Let's go. ",Classic
519, Try. Try. I shall have to carry you. ,Classic
84136," Is it, indeed? I hadn't realised. I've been wanting to meet you for a long time. Your paper on DNA synthesis was quite remarkable for your age. ",Classic
31322," Now, my theory is that I can insert a laser ray in this ridge here. The ray spreads, fuses the opening device and gets us in. ",Classic
154353," Doctor, help me! ",Classic
23546," It's dawn, Monsieur. The tocsin's rung. Curfew's over. ",Classic
112154, What? ,Classic
84731," Phase three alert in central security area. Intruder believed to be in main block, dressed as milkman. Apprehend and detain. ",Classic
44892, I have to.,Classic
36513, Is it more gas? ,Classic
35633, Out. ,Classic
67439," There's precious little to joke about, Miss Grant. That thing is appallingly dangerous. ",Classic
124402, Twenty nine. Twenty eight. Twenty seven. Twenty six. ,Classic
110922, That has been incumbent upon every president since time immemorial. None has ever found it. ,Classic
135284, You did it! ,Classic
136587, And rare? ,Classic
115667, And it's definitely another ship? ,Classic
136274, I took it off. It wasn't necessary. ,Classic
136713, Do I? ,Classic
14723, Leave me alone! ,Classic
34348, This is the voice of Amdo. Hear me. Bow down your heads that Amdo may accept your sacrifice. Bow. Let no human eyes witness this awful moment. ,Classic
26199," Ah, but I insist on coming with you. ",Classic
35864," Oh nonsense. I haven't used it very much. It's   not very reliable, as you can see. ",Classic
95804, Getting his samples aboard preparatory to launching. ,Classic
52267," The thread's run out. Now, should we not go back? ",Classic
42876," We cannot be sentimental in this situation, Doctor. Our mission continues. We must all play our part. ",Classic
52366, But she's alive! ,Classic
19852, Shall he then be put to death? ,Classic
152469," Mister Jobel, I love you. I'm risking my own life talking to you like this. ",Classic
154824, Officiating at your execution. ,Classic
23155," I think I can find it now. Thank you, Nicholas. ",Classic
86322," How very interesting. You've been found guilty of looting. Under the authority vested in me by the Emergency Powers Act, I'm issuing an order that you'll be held in a military detention centre for the duration of the emergency. You will be handed over to the civil authorities for trial and sentence when time permits. Put them on the next transport for detention centre, will you? ",Classic
47413," Excuse me, may I say something? When I was in the pipe room a short while ago, I'm sure I heard a movement coming from inside the pipe. ",Classic
49505, They nearly did. ,Classic
126166," Hexagram nine. Hsiao Ch'u. The taming power of the small. Quote, if you are sincere, blood vanishes and fear gives way. ",Classic
95336, Sounds like the Brigadier. ,Classic
134881, Right. Skipper. ,Classic
135583, Yes. Talor and I found out by accident. ,Classic
16993, Trapped. Trapped.,Classic
125215, Negative coordinates. ,Classic
7413, Do you think I don't understand? Trust is a two-sided affair. ,Classic
147494, What does he say? ,Classic
52676, And it's people? ,Classic
55814," But if we surrender the Doctor and Zoe, we ourselves will be killed. ",Classic
127160," Well, I can see the force of that argument, but what I'm more interested in is finding my ",Classic
10091, Take a closer look. ,Classic
110204, That's right.   What do you think? ,Classic
157623," Mel dear, I do think by now you should be appreciating that though Tabby and myself are not averse to a humourous remark now and then, no joke was intended.   See if you can spot the basil. ",Classic
92386," Yes, you do. Yes, you do. ",Classic
36230," He thinks he knows best all the time, but this time he's wrong. ",Classic
134789," I am Zarak, of the race of the Xeraphin.   My brother has misled you, Doctor. We need no help. The Xeraphin has a new destiny. ",Classic
90246," Ah, poor fellow. I hope they won't be too hard on him. He fell into bad company, you know. Oh well, I must be off. ",Classic
114039, Er. ,Classic
24924, Of course. I've been waiting for you a long time. ,Classic
32384," We shall see, shan't we. ",Classic
132235, How extraordinary! ,Classic
46208," Me, perhaps? ",Classic
132560, We can all speak for him. ,Classic
58098, But it is the truth! ,Classic
62839," Well there was some bruising, and one arm was clawed, and there's a possibility of mild concussion. ",Classic
89778," Right, hang on! ",Classic
36973," Well, yes. He chased me. I'd recognise him anywhere. ",Classic
25763," Oh, my dear, don't talk too soon. The mind is indestructible. So is the Toymaker. ",Classic
1558, Shall I help you to the fourth level with them? ,Classic
136611," What is it? Go away, go away.   Go away, go away. ",Classic
84433, Thank you. ,Classic
60708, Do you have the authority to have me killed? ,Classic
146891," I don't know, but there's method to his madness, of that I'm certain. In the meantime, carry on with your calculations. We don't want to arouse Mestor's suspicions. ",Classic
71104, This is unbelievable! ,Classic
110712," Oh, yes, yes, yes, of course. ",Classic
75708," Splendid, thank you. A most interesting trip. ",Classic
94261," Nonetheless, I believe it.   Whatever is happening in the gold mines, Vorus, and strange stories have reached my ears, your guards have never before resorted to murder. ",Classic
149853, Are you trying to be funny? ,Classic
151687, Hello. What are you doing here? ,Classic
158515, Can't you somehow get around it? ,Classic
1259, Yes. ,Classic
10467," Right. Now, lift! ",Classic
92294," Yes. Quite chatty this time. Garrulous, even. ",Classic
90182," Wakey, wakey! Rise and shine! Show a leg, the weather's fine.",Classic
118188, Doctor? ,Classic
95384," Right, sir. ",Classic
108648," Come on, move yourselves. Report for work at once. Work! Work!   Collector's orders. ",Classic
108422," Also, bulletin information that the Doctor's companion is to be publically executed for her crimes against the Company. ",Classic
146909, Is it possible to get into the hatchery? ,Classic
95527, No? ,Classic
72428," Here, what's happened to your boy? ",Classic
60967," So, you call everyone together for a meeting, huh? Why? Maybe you plan to take over my territory, huh? ",Classic
62794," Well, Doctor? ",Classic
146071," Oh, don't be so dramatic, Father. ",Classic
89663, The ones in the crystal. ,Classic
148731, I once spent eight days down there searching for escaped prisoners. I know it only too well. ,Classic
80425," Oh, Daddy, there's something dreadful out there! ",Classic
97260, Hang on! I know one of the ways out! ,Classic
157939, Send the Cleaners to the Cleaners.  ,Classic
125190," Shhh. Ready? Thrusters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. ",Classic
15837," There, now. ",Classic
18138," Well of course they didn't. My ship's not made of tin like this old trash. Oh, good gracious me! Seems if I cough too loudly, the whole thing'd fall to pieces. ",Classic
57209, What's this section for? ,Classic
41979, They were designed to serve the Intelligence. ,Classic
93814," Come on, Nyder, you can do better than that. ",Classic
36653," Yes, well, the later the better. The only thing we can do for Jamie now is to give him time. Lock the door. ",Classic
111822," Tricks? Oh, dear chap. My dear.   Look.   Your eyes are closing. Sit down. Closing. That's right. Shush. ",Classic
75434, I see. But Miss Grant was sure she'd caught sight of your prisoner at the base. ,Classic
163426," Yes, I get the idea, Ace. Where's Excalibur? ",Classic
104805, Well? ,Classic
95962, Activate cyclostimulators. ,Classic
7917, Why? ,Classic
134021," Yes, the RT started to break up and the transponder signal just faded from the screen. ",Classic
122875," No, the Nimon will fulfil his great promise! The Nimon be praised! ",Classic
90796, Thank you. ,Classic
160844, Fine. ,Classic
17825," Arrived, have we? ",Classic
52460," Oh, Doctor, are you sure this is a good idea? ",Classic
72608, The end of the world.,Classic
146217, What are you saying? ,Classic
109953, What things? ,Classic
37180," Of course, it was Polly. You saw her. ",Classic
79007, But a little while ago you were a raging monster and an evil destroyer. ,Classic
142126, Maybe it did. ,Classic
133623, Can you cope with the two of them? ,Classic
122160," The odd thing is, the new equipment seems to be the product of an entirely different technology. ",Classic
88890," Oh, Doctor! ",Classic
66296, And how do we do that? ,Classic
136062, But you think so. ,Classic
65208, We do know. I've got a plane to catch. There's an emergency meeting of the Security Council in Geneva in an hour's time. ,Classic
142524, Why don't they attack? ,Classic
90011," No, Sabor, it's too dangerous. ",Classic
28116, Nothing. One of you customers wants to go home.   You want to be careful who you encourage. ,Classic
137806, Mawdryn? That's it! They've been contaminated. ,Classic
37292, Not you. That girl. She just couldn't care less. ,Classic
33786," Yes, lets. Come on.   Oh, give us a hand. ",Classic
31850, Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Stand back! ,Classic
150731," To die, to sleep. To sleep, perchance to dream. Where are you, Anita? ",Classic
67272," Professor Stahlman, I'll be switching to robot controls in forty nine minutes. ",Classic
136205, There's no need for this. ,Classic
87945, What test? ,Classic
41261," It is but armour, such as any warrior would wear. The devil in his guile wears his armour beneath the skin to protect his evil heart. ",Classic
87377," Sir, I've got to send them. ",Classic
112048," Doctor, if they're all out searching for Unstoffe, why don't we go down to the Relic room and get the segment? It'll be unguarded. ",Classic
46627, Don't worry. I'm going to try not to let it happen. ,Classic
152377, Yes. ,Classic
164330," You changed. Like the rest of this verminous planet, you adapted to your situation to survive.   Well, you'll never change again. ",Classic
133256, So you've done all these calculations for nothing. ,Classic
152529, Of course. ,Classic
87951, Computer eye indicates the symbols provide a simple logic test. We must deduce which symbol does not conform to all others. ,Classic
95701, Let's get some lights round here. ,Classic
62375," No, Channing. You can't stop me now. ",Classic
21092, Dalek technology is the most advanced in the Universe. ,Classic
40938," Jamie, get back! It'll kill you!   ",Classic
144680, Yes. Your Trion settlers must have tapped the volcanic gas. It's a very complex control mechanism. A seismic energy converter for powering a city. ,Classic
11803, Scanner frequencies have been changed in Central control. ,Classic
23452," Because he's kind, Monsieur, and gentle. ",Classic
82043, With no oxygen in the cylinders. ,Classic
74427," Sit down, Princess. Why did you try to escape? ",Classic
62106," Miss Shaw, your work in this laboratory is part of one big exercise. You'll have to be patient. You say this, er, creature was armed? ",Classic
11064, Attack! ,Classic
134373," Space is within us, Doctor. ",Classic
163230," Ah, Mister Warmsly. If you'd join Mister Rawlinson in the vehicle, we'll evacuate you from the area. ",Classic
155701, No. ,Classic
96487, What do you think they're doing? ,Classic
11683, Proof? Let me see.   Details of the acid bomb used in the unprovoked attack on the London saucer landing area. ,Classic
127321," Proctor Neman, please take me to my father.",Classic
68441," Well, that's all we needed. What with the peace conference on our hands as well. ",Classic
93129, Step into the security scan. ,Classic
707," The young man of their tribe came towards you, but he did not kill. He told me his name. ",Classic
134795," Zarak, do you not yearn for shape and touch and feeling? My brother, our true destiny is the becoming of ourselves. All our power must be combined to work with the Doctor against the rebel Time Lord. ",Classic
6833, Grandfather! Grandfather. ,Classic
53194," Isobel never writes anything on paper. You can't lose a wall, remember.  ",Classic
81627," Oh, you don't want to worry about those things, Jo. As long as you tell them the truth, they can't do you any harm. ",Classic
53231," Yes, of course, Jamie. Come on. ",Classic
12119," Oh, I'm over. Can you manage? ",Classic
61684," Doctor Lomax, path lab. You just sent up a blood sample for cross matching. ",Classic
90069," I saw him! He's alive. He's alive, I tell you. ",Classic
106666, Who are you? ,Classic
38369," Yes.   I say, that's very good. Just come in, eh? Mint condition. Eighteen seventy, is it? ",Classic
34205, The low road. ,Classic
75942," Now, Doctor, for your information the capture of this naval base is the first step in the return of this planet to its rightful owners. Right, bring him in, will you?",Classic
77932," It is, and your friend the professor, is trying to use that crystal, as it was used four thousand years ago, to capture the Kronavore. ",Classic
150635, Can you drive this machine? ,Classic
112439, Mmm. ,Classic
164310," That, sir, is no way to speak in front of a ladylike. ",Classic
97463, Sarah? Sarah? No Sarah. No Sarah. No Sarah. ,Classic
69392, No? ,Classic
72178," Oh, aye. ",Classic
99213, Thank you. ,Classic
45016, Salamander?   ,Classic
48775," Isn't there?   We're just drifting, Jamie. Drifting aimlessly in space. Perhaps that's what the Tardis was trying to warn us about. ",Classic
159910," Coming, coming. ",Classic
138781, You're being very calm about it. ,Classic
10646," Oh, I'm just wondering about the time factor, my boy. ",Classic
157076, I know what I have to do. ,Classic
147596," Listen, you pathetic creature. All we need do is convince the guard we are prisoner and escort. At least, until we get close enough to deal with them. ",Classic
154691, Why not examine her? ,Classic
12190, Barbara! ,Classic
109915, The course is obvious. ,Classic
25702," We will see, old man. The game is not yet over. We shall see.",Classic
14040, Hrostar? ,Classic
104297, I've no idea. He didn't introduce himself. ,Classic
40634," Better? Well, who for? ",Classic
98041, Here. ,Classic
159058, I'm beginning to feel a rather cosy warm sensation in my money pouch. ,Classic
21998," Now, that's one thing you mustn't do, my dear. Remember, they have the same type of machines and they can follow us. ",Classic
20685, Shh! ,Classic
9271," Well, as far as I know, Webster was an Englishman who'd come over to France to persuade Stirling to return to England. Stirling must be a spy. ",Classic
162922, An earthquake? In England? ,Classic
102621, I grow tired. I'm thinking no longer. ,Classic
31883, There's only one possible way that you could know I'm not the Examiner. ,Classic
140799, Institute an immediate and rigorous search of the Castellan's office and living quarters.,Classic
96298, As you wish. ,Classic
160872," I can't do anything till I find my list, now can I?   Oh dear. Doesn't look like Daphne S went down too well, now does it?   ",Classic
93931, They're pretty bad. ,Classic
34696," Oh, Jamie, I think we're lost. Are you sure this is the way Ara told us to come? ",Classic
61297, What's he doing? ,Classic
65790," Wherever you were, you very nearly didn't get back. ",Classic
30772, And you're prepared to just let this happen? ,Classic
19486, All right. Then we'll have to use his help without his knowing it.,Classic
54732," Well, don't take any chances. We'll get there as soon as we can. Where should we head for? ",Classic
46404, Anything we can do? ,Classic
2120," Hey, Grandfather, look. ",Classic
125719, He has given us unending life. He summoned us here speaking to the others through my mind. We fed and nourished him until now he is ready to arise. ,Classic
150939, Let him speak. ,Classic
76436, I'm coming with you. ,Classic
163094," I think I saw something over there.   Ace, I think it's time for plan B. ",Classic
49824, He's just closed himself away. ,Classic
145534," Deposits left by the bat colonies. Raw Spectrox contains a chemical similar to mustard nitrogen. It's deadly to humans, so they use the androids to collect the stuff and take it to the refinery. ",Classic
90025, No! ,Classic
82826," They get very agitated whenever an invisible Spiridon comes near them. It's given us a, well, a kind of early warning system. ",Classic
33687, No! ,Classic
111185, And you know about the Sash of Rassilon. ,Classic
23207, Why? ,Classic
78874, You would question my decision? ,Classic
50718, You are surrounded. ,Classic
80338, Skeleton keys. ,Classic
145665," You're a wily fellow, Salateen, I've always said so. But how will that help? ",Classic
115591," You seem to make a habit of interfering in my affairs, Doctor.",Classic
157179," You don't have to do that. What about Mel, then?   What's the matter? ",Classic
34490," Tell them what? I tell them nothing. They're not people like us, they're just a bunch of sardines. You heard me. Cold-blooded fishes. You haven't got a drop of good red blood in your body.   A flatfish from Galway would have more guts in them than that bunch.     You wouldn't hurt a little child. ",Classic
134738," Angela, don't give up now. You mustn't let go of your mind. ",Classic
63613, Wait ,Classic
57098, Well ,Classic
56570, I wish I had your optimism.,Classic
152317, I believe assassins are attempting to infiltrate my base. It concerns me that those who are attempting to kill me might also try the same with you. ,Classic
82775," No, light wave sickness. That's what the others had. ",Classic
129597, I'm sure that Monarch or one of his ministers will wish to satisfy your curiosity. ,Classic
118705, I obey. ,Classic
140454, Look   Doctor?   What's going on? ,Classic
27539," No, no, no. They will give us a chance. There are many passages and he may not know which one to follow. Come with me. ",Classic
52386, Have you been sent to find me? ,Classic
48499," That way. Through the pipelines. Mister Harris, this is the only way to help your wife and all those other people. ",Classic
164280," Mister Josiah, sir. I am in his service. ",Classic
67617, She did. ,Classic
100415, Is she all right? ,Classic
35898," We don't know who you are, strangers, but we are grateful. Medok is one of our last patients in the Colony. We've done our best for him but he gets worse day by day. I wasn't informed you were travelling across our territory. Hurry back to the Colony and tell the Pilot what's happened. ",Classic
153428," Not part of the scenes being shown by the Scrapyard here. I'm sorry, Valeyard. Force of habit, I apologise. ",Classic
114684," Vivien, what are those things? ",Classic
144616," Just a bit further, Doctor, please. ",Classic
134737," I'm trying to fight it. I feel so tired. Help me, Roger. I can't always control the illusions. ",Classic
19181, Is that what he's trying to find now? The old vaccine? ,Classic
81909, No doubt. But that doesn't mean we should hand them over to anyone. ,Classic
11892, But it's showing on the screen. Come and look. I'll help you. ,Classic
42492, Mars? We thought you were dead and then you came alive. What happened? ,Classic
28351," Did you know the fellow, Doctor? ",Classic
143421, That's the idea. ,Classic
52356, What? ,Classic
113722, The BIDS? ,Classic
150016, It's not possible. You're imagining it. ,Classic
60193," All right, all right! Spencer, take those stores over to our HQ.   You ought to know better, Harper. ",Classic
75750, There are many thousands of our people in hibernation in this base. We have other colonies hidden all round the world. We shall be the victors in the war against mankind. ,Classic
89670, But I must see K'Anpo. ,Classic
147314," I'm not blind, Peri. You look uncomfortable in that hole. Let me help you out. ",Classic
61042," Right. Good. Right, carry on. That's the first one, Roman Zone. Control unit's been completely destroyed. ",Classic
2203," Yes, I'm clear. Rope coming over. ",Classic
60148, Was the experiment successful? ,Classic
152513, Right. Where shall we meet you? ,Classic
146110, You did it jolly well. ,Classic
137410," What worries me is the level of coincidence in all this. Almost as if some cosmic influence. Still, that won't get me the Tardis back. Now, Brigadier, we've got to establish the precise time all this happened. ",Classic
75241, Of course. All that silly talk about a golf tournament. ,Classic
129797," What, three billion people? ",Classic
110427, Yes. ,Classic
110867," That's not going to hold forever, Chancellor. ",Classic
17238," No, it's not far from here. It's just at the top of the hill. And when the winds in the right direction, you can hear the monks much clearer, as though they're down in the village. ",Classic
12726," Oh really, well done, well done, yes. ",Classic
129391, Calm down. It won't bite. ,Classic
136528, It's just a cheap fake. I picked it up at the market. ,Classic
12797," Oh, I'll do what you say, Doctor, but it does seem a bit of a waste. Bye. ",Classic
19165, What did you say? ,Classic
122015, Hmm? What? ,Classic
106561, You mean not physical at all? ,Classic
159031," What's happening? Can't breathe. Too warm. Kracauer, what is this?   No, not my statue. No! Who has desecrated the monument? Who?   Belazs. ",Classic
104655," Unsuccessful time travel, Professor. Findicker's discovery of the double nexus particle sent human science up a technological cul-de-sac. ",Classic
89525," Well, I hope you all know what you're on about. ",Classic
51424, No. ,Classic
35304," Polly, are you suggesting that I'm not competent to carry out these tests? ",Classic
147136," Yes. Yes, that too. But not unstable. This is the real me, Peri. But don't be afraid. I won't hurt you. I promise.",Classic
135145, Didn't you see the ornamentation? The fountain? ,Classic
92773, Murderer. Murderer! ,Classic
140569, If only he'd managed to send that signal. ,Classic
32487," Well, the guns don't work against them! ",Classic
83681, It's a bonus I never expected. ,Classic
28878," Yes, I think it's quite normal. Yes, the temperature's all right. Well, I think you can leave, but watch your step. ",Classic
160725, Nice. ,Classic
21942, Oh! You think it's yours? ,Classic
106519, Can I borrow K9? ,Classic
42148, Priority override. ,Classic
88416, You set off the automatic defence system. There's a bit of magic to scare off the natives. ,Classic
130199, I've already told you. ,Classic
76648, What? ,Classic
59654," There's nothing there, only wall. ",Classic
141520, I am ,Classic
121350, Good. Start building up power. ,Classic
38374," But then you would be as wise as I, and that wouldn't do at all, would it? ",Classic
106066," Not now, Meeker. ",Classic
70203," Oh, all right, but I fail to see what good it will do. ",Classic
124449," Doctor, I don't want to spend the rest of my life on Gallifrey. After all this. ",Classic
35890," Unless I'm very much mistaken, these creatures are so big they're going to see us long before we see them. ",Classic
51457, Good. Let's see if we were followed. ,Classic
103294, He had time to scream. ,Classic
83864," Did my stint in the fields before breakfast, didn't I. ",Classic
85347," Ah well, just shows there's always a silver lining. And your name? ",Classic
163629," Madam, my patience has already been sorely tried by the interminable journey from Oxford. ",Classic
152837," You know, I'm glad I decided to come here. I might stay here for a year or so and write a thesis. Ancient Life on Ravalox by Doctor ",Classic
156293, We had an agreement. I've done my bit. I've delivered the Doctor.   Uh uh. The Matrix memory tapes first. ,Classic
112039," Our men have covered all the exits, Highness. No one will escape. ",Classic
98774," Well, we'd better find it, then, hadn't we, and quick. ",Classic
163039," The question is, how do we get through here? ",Classic
9732, Robespierre will be arrested after tomorrow's convention meeting. ,Classic
89358, Om. ,Classic
47430," If you allow the pressure to build up in the pipeline, you'll blow the whole rig sky-high. ",Classic
7635, Molybdenum.  1 ,Classic
46149, Three? There are only two. ,Classic
132027, Open the cage and find out. ,Classic
162907, What's that noise? ,Classic
53436, Our friend the Doctor's a resourceful man. No wonder our allies fear him. ,Classic
13266," Well, come on then, Doctor. Ah. How do we open the doors? We have no power. ",Classic
112366," Thank you very much. Goodbye, Garron. ",Classic
88867," Well, er, go and take a close look at Sskel. ",Classic
18929, Why have you chosen to come here? ,Classic
57229, I hope they know what they're doing. It's been years since we sent up a satellite. ,Classic
93866, We're getting a picture on one of these scanners. ,Classic
53782," Brigadier, you don't, by any chance, know where I can find a canoe? ",Classic
136598," Mental powers, easily misunderstood. ",Classic
41148, Keep it back. ,Classic
116642, Don't go. ,Classic
69625," There's only one thing for it, Doctor. We'll have to give him back that wretched circuit. ",Classic
76792," Well, we'll just have to search them all over again, won't we? ",Classic
130844, We could cover the whole floor. ,Classic
40044," Okay, press the buttons. ",Classic
139390, You've killed your thoughts. You're hiding them from me. ,Classic
1450," What, drawing power from the floor? ",Classic
62296," I cannot tell you, yet. ",Classic
97630, Styggron! You have betrayed me. ,Classic
82249, You'd only be wasting your time. The Ogrons have got the finest defence mechanism of all. Stupidity. They haven't got a mind for you to probe. ,Classic
116502," What? If we're caught loitering outside of here, they'll put two and two together   You're putting two and two together. I can tell by the expression on your face that you're putting two and two together. ",Classic
133225," This one calls himself the Doctor, and does nothing else but interfere. ",Classic
4262, That's the mighty Kublai Khan. ,Classic
52152," Oh, the Master again, eh? I suppose this army of robots works for the Master as well. ",Classic
151811, Ah. Thought I recognised the landscape. He'll be harmless enough there. At least he'll have somewhere to swim for the next thousand years. ,Classic
159934, Prepare the assault shuttle. ,Classic
84219," Yes, of course. That's the west seam. Come on. Let's go after them. ",Classic
100083, Never. ,Classic
28828," Good heavens! But what about all the other War Machines, Doctor? ",Classic
80193, Bye. ,Classic
158040," Surprise, surprise! By Jove, yes. Welcome, friends. A thousand welcomes. ",Classic
114542, If you must. ,Classic
148994, Murderous would be more apt. ,Classic
115846, Two minutes to shot. ,Classic
95348," Mister Benton, prepare to move out. ",Classic
31840, He just went past. That means we can get into his laboratory again. ,Classic
113542, Congratulations. ,Classic
71883," Morgan, where's Caldwell? None of the other miners have seen him. ",Classic
107410," There was something chasing me. I, I couldn't move. Just a dream, I suppose.   Hey, what's wrong? ",Classic
114494, Is that important? ,Classic
134826, I thought this thing would never stabilise. ,Classic
108694, What are you doing? ,Classic
153424," The accused is clearly ignorant of the latest methods of surveillance, my lady. ",Classic
150690," They've just ordered a dozen breasts of pigeons, probably to help down the last of their dozen bottles of wine. ",Classic
162433, She's taking Deadbeat to the bus. ,Classic
161417, Money! ,Classic
79869," Quickly, they're coming! ",Classic
15075," Well, there aren't any windows. ",Classic
164670, Hello. ,Classic
92937, Or affect their genetic development so that they evolve into less aggressive creatures. ,Classic
1322," We must try and talk to the Daleks. Alydon says the Thals are going to starve unless they can find new supplies of food. You see, after the war, the Thals that survived managed to cultivate small plots of land. Well, that's how they've survived ever since. But they've always had to be very, very careful, because the crops have always been in danger. But, you see, they rely on a great rainfall that only happens about every four or five years. Well, it's two years overdue now, and all their crops are ruined. Well, that's why the whole Thal race had to leave their plateau and go in search of food. ",Classic
3334," Water! Susan, Susan, child. Susan, wake up. Wake up, quickly! Fetch some cloth and cups. ",Classic
148488, No. ,Classic
97310," Ah, yes, Doctor, but I have recently re-established radio contact with Earth. They know about the stabiliser failure that sent me into orbit around Jupiter. They know how I've rationed my provisions, particularly drinking water. My recycling experiments. Already, every telescope on Earth is trained on that little patch of sky where my XK-5 will reappear. ",Classic
66842," You can always join the others outside, you know, Mister Sutton. ",Classic
82082, No. Why I'm still alive. ,Classic
67611, Good. I'll be right down.   Stop her! That's a bomb! ,Classic
75839, Still in the submarine. ,Classic
112766," One of those, is it? How do the guards get there? ",Classic
158507,   Doctor. ,Classic
31795, Thanks very much. ,Classic
30622, I said you seem to be enjoying all this. ,Classic
58223, Milo Clancey's base? ,Classic
58529," Oh, look, Doctor, will you stop it? ",Classic
88874," No, Sarah is absolutely right. Those two were in the refinery all the time. ",Classic
78593," Of course I am. All or nothing, literally! What a glorious alternative! ",Classic
124045, What? ,Classic
115977," That's right. Of course, that was all a long time ago. ",Classic
155029," Ah, saved your ship, though, Commodore. ",Classic
53825, Yes. ,Classic
92007, That thing? ,Classic
151531, I'll help you. ,Classic
14497," The same, and if he has the articles you mentioned, then he stole them from me. ",Classic
35589, Well done. ,Classic
153714," Very well, Doctor. Present yourself at my portals alone. Merdeen? ",Classic
22083, Set up for a take! ,Classic
30475, Your commander is still waiting for your report. ,Classic
16495, I'm afraid not. It's down to eight. It will be reduced even further after our next landing. We must face the facts. The Daleks are closing in on us.  ,Classic
163406, With silver. ,Classic
114473," How's that, K9? ",Classic
20601," Yes, there is. There's us. We can start again. With your cousin's help we can, we can build another Troy.",Classic
19453," I don't know. It could mean a simple break in communications, or that he was attacked! ",Classic
150063, Not if one is careful. I've used cyanide since I was a boy. It's quicker and kinder to the little creatures than ammonia. ,Classic
10248," Yes, that's an idea. ",Classic
94310, It's coming this way. ,Classic
37473, The Commandant's office. ,Classic
124283, Right. ,Classic
65851, Shall I give the order? ,Classic
158662, The money. ,Classic
20586," Cressida, look what's happened. ",Classic
43478," That reactor gives us light, heat and power. ",Classic
133958, We can change what happened if we materialise before Adric was killed. ,Classic
109432, Kill him! Kill him! ,Classic
59814, Someone's out there with Carstairs. ,Classic
160085," Ace, I didn't know it was the Daleks. I was just doing Mister Ratcliffe a favour. ",Classic
118595," Yes, yes, I've heard all that before. Now do be a good chap, eh? Stay quiet.   I've got to concentrate. ",Classic
99119," My whole body's changing. Look at my arm. Get me to a hospital, please. ",Classic
146516, That stupid girl's watch. How I hate these hit or miss performances. ,Classic
76782, So? ,Classic
17515," Oh, goodbye and thank you, Father. ",Classic
16195, The elders have made their reply to the Daleks. ,Classic
1855," We will not fight. There will be no more wars. Look at our planet. This was once a great world, full of ideas and art and invention. In one day it was destroyed. And you will never find one good reason why we should ever begin destroying everything again. I'm sorry. ",Classic
7754, Do you see? Even this half-broken creature here admits the truth.  2 ,Classic
148561, Pull the lever! Stretch them out of this life! ,Classic
48985," Something else worrying you, Tanya? ",Classic
42252," No, it isn't. It doesn't have to happen. If you'll excuse me.   Cut out the reactor link for a start! Uncouple the transformer unit.   the density phase and power. ",Classic
19266, Who are you? ,Classic
83470, Dalek patrol three is proceeding towards the city with remainder of Spiridon slave workers. ,Classic
36602," Doctor, quickly. ",Classic
137685, But can never die. ,Classic
42583, Me? ,Classic
109550," These cylinders you speak of, tell us what they look like. If they are indeed here, you shall have them and take them to your comrades. ",Classic
123076, And this matching tachyon field creates a temporary reduplication of any physical object. Are there any questions? ,Classic
146855, Now go away. We have a lot of work to do. Come. ,Classic
5801, Why haven't you obeyed my commands? Where's Sabetha? ,Classic
152476, We shall see about that. I shall speak to him myself. ,Classic
111712, Very well. ,Classic
121086, Really? Then where did you go? ,Classic
148949, Imbeciles. Are you incapable of using your brains? What advantage do you think that'd bring you? You let the man you should have destroyed go free. ,Classic
152955, They've got that woman we saw earlier. ,Classic
97750, You made a mistake. ,Classic
151549, This looks like it. ,Classic
1104, We're wasting time. We should be looking for Barbara. ,Classic
79612, Who in the name of heaven was that? ,Classic
93325," Yes, of course, and some of what I will tell you relates to events in the future. Not only on this planet but also on others whose existence you don't even know of. But my knowledge is scientific fact. Now, Davros has created a machine creature, a monster which will terrorise and destroy millions and millions of lives and lands throughout all eternity. He has given this machine a name, a Dalek. It is a word new to you, but for a thousand generations it is a name that will bring fear and terror. Now undoubtedly Davros has one of the finest scientific minds in existence, but he has a fanatical desire to perpetuate himself in his machine. He works without conscience, without soul, without pity, and his machines are equally devoid of these qualities. ",Classic
159146, Locking arms disengaged. ,Classic
10870," Oh what are you talking about, ample. A handful of unarmed men against Daleks? ",Classic
121604," We should have been on Azure hours ago. My passengers asked me to represent them, to take our complaint to the Captain. ",Classic
141184," No, my Lord. All we ask is that we be returned to our proper place in time and space. ",Classic
98127," Let go, please, Condo. You're hurting me. ",Classic
74475, That's barbaric! ,Classic
107272, Have I saved your life? ,Classic
34847, How would you know? You never seen it. ,Classic
77098, I'll tell you what happened. None of the ionisation rockets exploded in the atmosphere. Every single one hit the surface! ,Classic
89961,   I can't! ,Classic
141971, This way. ,Classic
115042," But remember, either Farrah or myself will be with you at all times. Don't let us down. ",Classic
108271, Good. ,Classic
151755, Are you all right? ,Classic
150657," Well, on this planet it is the custom. All the greatest chefs agree, Carema, Brillat Savaran, the noble Escoffier, they all agree that one should begin with a light dish, something to bring relish to the appetite. Pate du foie gras de Strasburg on croute, for instance, or a serving of Beylon oysters. Even a, even a light salad with artichoke hearts and country ham will suffice. It gets the digestive juices flowing! ",Classic
160374," Turn that off, dear. That's for my eyes only. Besides, you're missing my broadcast. ",Classic
48430, Hey! Hey! Hey! ,Classic
29095," Oh, sorry. ",Classic
130489, Silence! I need time to think. ,Classic
140037," Not at all. You may disguise your features, but you can never disguise your intent. ",Classic
120170," Now, my dear, I'll ask you just once more. You do know about the shell? ",Classic
10811," Read it, read it. ",Classic
103218," V8, lock up these two strangers. ",Classic
74698," Yes, Hepesh.",Classic
126249," If they've got a mass detector, they may have compatible memory wafers. ",Classic
88257," Well it seems to me, Eckersley, the Federation has brought a lot of its troubles on itself. ",Classic
147048," Dear friend, you are too unstable. He would have swamped you. You would have been the pebble drowning in his lake. ",Classic
123446, Your West Lodge can raise that much money? ,Classic
65990," Mister Phillips? Professor Stahlman has decided to modify the drilling rate. Could you join us at the computer, please? ",Classic
80318, Well then? ,Classic
109077, Affirmative. ,Classic
110368," Yes. Yes, rest here. ",Classic
81481," Come on, they're almost through. ",Classic
97755," Yes, that's another thing. How many did we count, Sarah? ",Classic
101375, What fellow? ,Classic
148337," Nah, they'll be all right. This batch of rebos are good. ",Classic
31216," Doctor, where are you?   Phwoar, ain't it hot. ",Classic
164979, Those two girls. They said they'd come back for me. ,Classic
99683, I came as quickly as I could. There were important matters of state to attend to. ,Classic
118690, How does it work? ,Classic
6270," I tell you, Tlotoxl is determined to destroy me. ",Classic
78537, Molecular structure stable. Increasing power. ,Classic
116327, Here we go. ,Classic
152711," I know somewhere that is truly tranquil, peaceful, restful. A panacea for the cares of mind. ",Classic
73471," Well, aren't you? They tried to kill you and me. ",Classic
21992, At least it's working. ,Classic
110112," Can't fool me, Borusa.   Well done, Doctor. ",Classic
119741, What do you think we've been chasing about for all this time? ,Classic
116268," No, no, no, no, that's a very good questions. After all, none of them can ever have seen the Earth. ",Classic
163219," Well, what do you want us to do? The area's swarming with Morgaine's troops. ",Classic
108397, Wouldn't it be interesting to find the answer? ,Classic
2435, Did it before he cut his head open. ,Classic
68492, The man's mad. ,Classic
151771, One life cannot be bought at the cost of a whole planet. ,Classic
4217, What ails it? ,Classic
92293, Again? ,Classic
111249, It's the ultimate weapon. The Demat gun. ,Classic
88133, We are? ,Classic
137769," Well, I hope so, because I've got to get the Tardis away from here. ",Classic
107673," Your sentence. It's a very annoying habit, Doctor. ",Classic
76663," Cotton, who told you that the Marshal wanted to see me? ",Classic
58563, Tarnation take it! A couple of years ago I'd have nailed him before he got ten yards. ,Classic
69189, Right. Now's our chance. ,Classic
54949, Is she being sacrificed? ,Classic
137949, Turlough. He left in the capsule. ,Classic
80894, Here we go again. ,Classic
58305, Me? Where? ,Classic
34528, I don't think so. Better duck down here. ,Classic
102116," Remained at the place of land, betrayed our fathers. ",Classic
7624, Stop! Disconnect the disintegrator. ,Classic
102486, We serve Xoanon and tend the holy places. We guard his tower against the savage. We deny the flesh so that our minds may find communion with Xoanon. ,Classic

You'd better go in the booth to guide him.  Right. Now we'll play The Toymaker's little game fairly. Go on, Dodo, start him off. ",Classic
61666," A police box? Munro, this man you found. ",Classic

74028," Here in the peaceful heart of England will soon take place what could be described as the most important summit conference of this century. The peaceful atmosphere of this Georgian house gives little indication of the underlying tension of the occasion. A desperate, last minute attempt to stem the rising tide of international tension that seems to be moving the great powers towards the brink of a third world war. Arriving now is Sir Reginald Styles, who with his team of government aides, has been working around the clock to make this meeting possible. Sir Reginald himself, has just returned from an eleventh hour meeting in Peking where his success in persuading the Chinese leaders to reconsider their walk out gave the first real chance of success to these talks. Talks, on which may well depend, the fate of the entire world. ",Classic
87589, We'll know soon enough. ,Classic
49735, How could they get in here? ,Classic

157228," They liked my clothes, which is clearly not enough. ",Classic
139699, What? ,Classic
159550, That is to be expected. I must be informed of his movements. ,Classic
15701," Yes, his conscience did need reminding. ",Classic

121275, Romana! Are you all right? ,Classic
165394," Well, go on. Go on, lad. What are you waiting for? ",Classic
163128," Down there, in a trap. ",Classic

111354," I am the White Guardian. In order to maintain the universal balance, there is also a Black Guardian, and he also requires the Key to Time, but for a different purpose. An evil purpose. He must not get it. Doctor, at all costs, you must prevent that. ",Classic
133788," Goodbye, Doctor. ",Classic
4651," Well, at least we know the rough location of the keys. Now all we have to do is get them. ",Classic
9040," I promise you, I give you my word, that I will not rest until the four of you have been brought together again. ",Classic
6675, I don't believe you. ,Classic

147756, I hope not. We intend to pay you. ,Classic

24575, Why? Where are you taking them? ,Classic
157303," Thanks, I'm really hungry. ",Classic
99187," You mightn't mean to, but you would. ",Classic
97865," I suppose you think raising these old fears can somehow help you, but I was present at his execution. Morbius is dead, Doctor, and you will join him very shortly. ",Classic
63778, They've sent you just about every drug in existence. Surely there must be something? ,Classic
155939," Yes, madam. ",Classic
76020," Myers, check that storeroom! ",Classic
43659, It's him all right. There's no shadow of doubt about it. ,Classic
158312, The Bannerman warfleet's on its way. ,Classic
102095, I will prepare myself. ,Classic
44801," It's all right. Mister Bruce isn't going to shoot anyone, are you?",Classic

76480," Varan's son's in your office, Marshal. ",Classic

72104,   The woman's round the twist if you ask me. Always has been. ,Classic
60376," No, there's nothing we can do. ",Classic

105775, You call yourself a doctor? That's the most insane suggestion I've heard in my life. ,Classic
150553, Take it from Shockeye. ,Classic
118270, Shall we go back inside? ,Classic
124090, I'll show you if I can find it. ,Classic
49445, And what's all that supposed to mean? ,Classic
86314, Yes. ,Classic
100889," Oh, but what? ",Classic
151345," Shut up, or you'll be joining him. ",Classic
61580, What? You mean that you're going to let me go free? ,Classic
112943," It's all beyond me, Doctor. I don't know where I am. ",Classic
1997, Did Elyon fall in? What happened? ,Classic
91081," As things are at the moment, it is. But in a more rationally ordered society ",Classic
69905, And that's our chance? ,Classic
56752," Aye, well, the Doctor may not have much time.",Classic
146168," Indeed.  One morn, a peri at the gate of Eden stood disconsolate. Who wrote that? ",Classic
65227," From the information that you've given me, I'll find them. Now, please, you must let me try. ",Classic
15573, The governor sent for me. I am to report to him. ,Classic

6359, I must question him about it. ,Classic
65740," Welcome to the Inferno, Mister Sutton. ",Classic
104720, What? ,Classic
116568," Noise, Fenner, noise. The Kroll hunts by sensing vibrations. Give it something to think about. ",Classic
162230, Why did you bring them here? ,Classic
118295," What? The living dead? You mean a planet ruled by zombies? I want to know who lives on this planet. With one basic difference, the living are very much like the dead. Who was it said the living are just the dead on holiday? Never mind. You should meet one. You can always tell a genuine zombie. ",Classic
3661, Thank you. ,Classic
44916, We'll not tell you a thing. ,Classic

4150," You can't know it all. Marco, just give me a strong horse. Now, by using your name, I can bring them both back to you. I can bring the girl to you, and the caravan will be safe. You need the caravan. Because when peace is concluded with Kublai Khan, he might very well exchange this magician's caravan for your return to Venice.   Ah, all their sympathies are with Ping-Cho.

36444," Go on. Help with the cable there. Go on, hurry up. That's the alarm. This gas is lethal. ",Classic
151038, But I am the Maylin! ,Classic
128617, I think the noise came from this direction. ,Classic
2458, My head. ,Classic
17963, Good. ,Classic
19921, Never knew her when she didn't. ,Classic
141557, But that doesn't mean I trust you. I should like to see a demonstration of your ship. ,Classic

31192, But you're the Doctor. ,Classic
157857, What? ,Classic
69181, The one inside the Keller machine. ,Classic

69834, Sir? ,Classic
146002, I didn't hear any firing. ,Classic
101531, What are you going to do? ,Classic
28267, I wonder which the nearest will be? ,Classic
47737, But how did it get in this book? ,Classic
48626," See you in the morning, Doctor? ",Classic
133841, The time draws near. ,Classic
115199, Seize him! He's killed the Princess. ,Classic
108358, Your name! ,Classic
100358, Leonardo? Leonardo who? ,Classic
3298," Marco, is this all we're going to get until tonight, hmm? ",Classic
21054," Well, it so happens that kind of jungle is apt to lead you back to the same place more than once. ",Classic
160539, I believe it's where they make sweets. ,Classic
77148," Yes, Earth Control has seen fit to have my project investigated. I want my reforms to have their approval. You and your friends here will confirm the necessity of stern measures. Outbreaks of plague and rebellion must be controlled, don't you agree? ",Classic
64644, Look! ,Classic
154393, I must do what I think is best. ,Classic
105524," Ah, but that was before you resigned and went into politics. Acquired a taste for high living then, didn't you. ",Classic
81220, Oh. ,Classic
140090, Aquitaine? ,Classic
116060," I will see to it when we return. Trust me, Ranquin. ",Classic

130189, It's beautiful. ,Classic
109475, Yes. Don't worry about it. ,Classic
120933, What? ,Classic
23132, No. ,Classic
86801," Well, the Doctor said it would have to be something like a nuclear generator and that started me remembering something. Wasn't there a plan once to build underground quarters for the government in the event of an atomic war? ",Classic
115185," An excellent suggestion, my dear Archimandrite. It would avoid a great deal of possible unpleasantness later. But we must wait for the exact moment. Everything must be done correctly. ",Classic
34841, I have it back in control again. ,Classic
116891," Marshal, I've got a hundred patients waiting. ",Classic
135491," It is time, my friend. The Council have been summoned to the place of termination. You have little time. Can you do it? ",Classic
115318, Where is the meeting to take place? ,Classic
133537, Cybermen are rather allergic to the stuff. Brings them out in a cold sweat. ,Classic
41570, What now? ,Classic
19121," For the simple reason that if they were in fact agents of the Refusians, they could have a achieved their objective in a much simpler way. One in which they would not have exposed themselves to this danger. ",Classic
113338, Kimus and K9? ,Classic
43845," You know what he'll do as soon as he sees you, a man who resembles Salamander so closely? ",Classic
83217, I might. Why did you come? ,Classic
107690," Mmm, of a kind called ma-ho-gany. I don't suppose you've ever seen wood before, have you, Citizen? ",Classic
58882, Leads out to the passage outside. And that steel is three inches thick. I tell you it's hopeless. I spent my first year down here working on that hinge. You can see it's hardly marked. ,Classic
57089," Now I'll dispatch you, and follow using the time switch. ",Classic
77993," Oh, where am I? ",Classic
20931, The old man certainly has got nerve. ,Classic
92029," Hello, Space Station Nerva. This is the Earth High Minister. The fact that you are hearing my voice in a message recorded thousands of years before the day in which you are now living, is a sure sign that our great undertaking, the salvation of the human race, has been rewarded with success. ",Classic
15321, All right. ,Classic
78808," Well, it's a harmless enough ambition, I should have thought? ",Classic
76191," All right, century wise. ",Classic
17898, Who are they? ,Classic
145100, Get away from the controls. ,Classic
83164, We will detonate them here. Activate mechanism. ,Classic
27745," Come on, Doctor. ",Classic
142430," Don't try. He's under the influence of the Malus. Are you with us, Colonel? ",Classic
63809, He's dead.,Classic
17553," Look, there's no point in us sitting here. I think we should go back to the monastery. ",Classic
44223," Something to read, perhaps? ",Classic
133586, Do we go on? ,Classic
165555, One finger can be a deadly weapon. ,Classic
152919, That totem is a navigational hazard. It must be dismantled. ,Classic
142911, Deaths unaccountable?   Rabbits. ,Classic
47726," I know what I would do. Close the compound, evacuate the rigs. ",Classic
137883, That is a question you must ask the Doctor. ,Classic
35156," Yes, but where? ",Classic
154221, Everything will be fixed well before your servants begin to understand their situation. ,Classic
114478, Continue. ,Classic
104260," Yes, well, perhaps we shouldn't wait for your friend the Doctor. Help yourself, my dear. Plates on the end of the table. I'll, er, I'll just put a log or two on the fire. ",Classic
84991, Permission? ,Classic
150492," Er, well, thank you, I think I have all the information I need. ",Classic
104047," Exactly what I think, but what kind of animal leaves mutilations like those? ",Classic
50148," Yes, I thought you'd realise somebody did. I imagine you have orders to destroy me. ",Classic
5480," The Guardians are very thorough, you know. Anyway, he'd want the murderer to be caught. Eprin was a good friend of his. He wouldn't conceal anything. ",Classic
119374, But he doesn't seem to be able to speak to me. ,Classic
51620," Replace the Quark. Continue operation. You will not be interrupted anymore. I will personally destroy these primitives. Quarks, follow.",Classic
44437," Some trouble in the kitchens, Leader. The new man says he's seen someone in the kitchen gardens. ",Classic
24577," The launcher is ready, One. The Doctor, the girl, the Guardian and Two are aboard. ",Classic
93575, What mistakes do they make? You will tell me! ,Classic
39723, Where are the prisoners? ,Classic
163033, This is no place for humour. ,Classic
18223," Oh, don't you believe that, my dear. Don't you believe that for one minute. No, that ray gun could go through this like a piece of paper. ",Classic
53770," Aye, if you think I'm going back inside there ",Classic
128893," Oh, I admire a man with an open mind. My own is closed upon the opinion that I am Shardovan. I have the honour to be librarian for the dwellings of Castrovalva. ",Classic
32698," Right, back both of you! Or your Laird won't need a doctor. ",Classic
37082, Get her? ,Classic
151108," Well, if you've been here before, no problem. ",Classic
28302, Oh! ,Classic
16742, The creatures caught him. I could do nothing. ,Classic
123258," Can I help you, Mister Hardin? Thank you.   Now, this is a wafer wave inducer, is it? ",Classic
110950, I must have reinforcements! I must seek out the Doctor. He will lead me to the Great Key. ,Classic
114838," Well, I've travelled. ",Classic
44339," Yes, I heard you. Where is it? ",Classic
73438," Well, I've already alerted my main personnel.  R/ ",Classic
79938," A very good question, Miss Grant. Come on! ",Classic
54343," Well, hard to say. Reports still coming in. Look, I'll send transport for you. You'll be safer here with us. ",Classic
59300," Oh, thank you very much. ",Classic
97359, So you do intend genocide. ,Classic
26279, Go get packed. ,Classic
18130, All right Doctor? ,Classic
143560," Look, my tour of duty finishes here in eight weeks. I'm dependent on a good report from the Captain for my next promotion. ",Classic
118963, Not bad. A bit boring in the middle. Don't move. You might spoil a priceless work of art. ,Classic
25406," Well, you go and like it somewhere else, and take your friend with you. ",Classic
126020, I tried to help him. ,Classic
42731," Oh well, now we're coming to it, aren't we? The great Clent would have to admit failure. That's it, isn't it? Poor old Clent. He never could face the music. Here, what about this creature at the glacier? ",Classic
594, Water. ,Classic
84924," Yes, Sergeant. ",Classic
56941," Oh yes, I'm fine. I've seen most of my friends killed. I'm being hunted by monsters. ",Classic
14436, It's nothing to me. I'm leaving Ramlah. ,Classic
43839," That's incredible, Doctor. He was born at Merida, state capital of Yucatan. ",Classic
13765," Have you finished now, Doctor? ",Classic
10817, Plague? ,Classic
6342," No. Let it continue, to the death!   Destroy him, Ixta. ",Classic
158892," It's no use, Doctor. Even if we did find the treasure, it'd take us longer than seventy two hours, and Belazs said if I didn't return Kane's money within seventy two hours they'd confiscate my spacecraft. ",Classic
148124," Yes, yes, yes.   Good evening. ",Classic
114692, There is still the matter of your delayed execution. ,Classic
156734, And leave the Lakertyans to the machinations ,Classic
133151, Power building. ,Classic
96599, Blasting gelignite. ,Classic
76972, If only we had a rope. ,Classic
52887," Well, you can try telephoning but I doubt if you'll get any joy. Phone's in the hall and the number's scribbled on the wall. ",Classic
93487," No. No, you see, halfway across the wastelands we were attacked by a band of mutos. ",Classic
123901, All right. We've tried everything else. ,Classic
162733, It's in the CAMRA guide. We call it Arthur's Ale. ,Classic
24816," So far, but they haven't found the bomb yet. ",Classic
77476, I'll say you were. A real pippin of a dream. I've brought you a cup of tea. Do you want it? ,Classic
95799, Any weapons? ,Classic
63940, This is the molecular disperser. It will convert the energy of the nuclear reactor into microwaves. ,Classic
47727, He'd never do it. ,Classic
29997, If I keep my lads out of the village? ,Classic
96931, I came here on a story about two years ago. ,Classic
147117," Well, you've got the map. ",Classic
36177," Come on, Medok. ",Classic
57329, Another moment and we could have destroyed him. There's some more HD cable there. ,Classic
49452, But Cybermen exist. You've got to believe me. You've got to! ,Classic
135712," We know who sent it, though. ",Classic
44628," I'm sorry, Captain. ",Classic
35066, Can't find him? Ralph? ,Classic
164392, Fine time to watch a video. ,Classic
21388, The report did not say. But it is believed that they come from the tenth galaxy under the leadership of Trantis. ,Classic
1936, Yes. ,Classic
10386," Two eight seven? Yes. Hold on. I have a call for you. Go ahead, please. ",Classic
79016, In the Tardis. ,Classic
72758," Well, how do you do it then? ",Classic
88173," Run, Doctor, quick! ",Classic
155192," When I viewed the Matrix earlier, that isn't what happened. ",Classic
70312," Minus thirty five? Think, Jo! Think, Jo! ",Classic
5532, Well that sounds an improvement on fingerprints. ,Classic
53174," Look, Jamie, sandwiches. I'm hungry. Want one? ",Classic
85199," Well, Jo, we'd better get back to UNITHQ. We've got a report to make out. ",Classic
152995," Pick him up. Grell, patrol. ",Classic
5808, His life's work destroyed. ,Classic
75337," The girl, too? ",Classic
146410, Taken our memories away. ,Classic
30626, Yes? ,Classic
8324," Yes, sir. Clear and definite proof.  1 ",Classic
108165," All right, K9. Bite. ",Classic
108900, It was what happened on Minyos that led to our policy of non-intervention. ,Classic
53842, I'm sure this is a misunderstanding. I talk to the C in C of internal security myself. ,Classic
146569," Vegetables from the Royal Hatcheries, master. ",Classic
103469," Professional interest or morbid curiosity? Which? There are three types of robots aboard this mine. Dumbs, Vocs, a Super Voc, and then there's you. Would you care to explain that? I see. Well then, perhaps I'd better tell SV7 you can talk. ",Classic
106681," We have waited, waited in the cold wastes of space. Waited for mankind to come. And now we have not only space but time itself within our grasp. ",Classic
83567, And what then? One bomb against an army of Daleks? ,Classic
41042, Where? ,Classic
87," Yes, I can see red turns to blue, Mister Chesterton, but that's because we're dealing with two inactive chemicals. They only act in relation to each other. ",Classic
26809," Yes, I see. ",Classic
31448," But not impossible. Ben, Polly. ",Classic
143487," Well, the Tardis engines would be working properly, for one thing. ",Classic
70946," By the way, Captain Dent wanted you to show me the dome that was wrecked. ",Classic
116690, Princess Astra. ,Classic
9356," If I'm wrong, there'll be no repercussions, will there, Citizen? ",Classic
160869, I want to find out if there's an artist appearing in the Forum tonight. ,Classic
155086, Pity. ,Classic
139166, Stand by to shorten sail. ,Classic
80712, They'll never make it.,Classic
100757, Tell me more. ,Classic
165390, Mmm.,Classic
38249," Splendid, Splendid. I'll take that Brussels call now. ",Classic
151235," My name is Herbert. From your sudden materialisation, I presume you are a spirit from the other side. ",Classic
119880," No idea. Let's find out, shall we? Not you, K9. You stay here. By the way, how did you know about Peter Rabbit? ",Classic
61318, We must go to the landing bay and stop him.,Classic
2369," Where do you get your knowledge, Doctor? You know, there never seems to have been time to ask, but we don't really know where you come from, or why. ",Classic
15589, Yes. ,Classic
44280, She's got friends here. They're going to arrange passes and the right sort of uniform. ,Classic
164093," Oh, you mean the old bag, the housekeeper? ",Classic
145610, Five. ,Classic
22889, Underground. Why didn't we think of that before? ,Classic
33359, If only we knew where the others were. ,Classic
127070," Why this brave gesture, Consul Tremas? ",Classic
45745, What's that noise? ,Classic
126298, Alert. Danger. ,Classic
95951, Do it! ,Classic
124295," Well, gentlemen, we are ready. ",Classic
82409, Two raiding ships have returned. ,Classic
25994," And Harper, You take a walk down main street and see if you can find Holliday. I'm gettin' tired of just sittin' here waitin'. ",Classic
67130," Well, if you could slow down the drilling rate, I can get a proper job done. ",Classic
43683," Oh, yes. Yes. I don't think I like the look of this. Let's go. ",Classic
142169," He isn't a prisoner, Sergeant Willow. You must treat visitors with more respect. ",Classic
11771," Right, Doctor. ",Classic
105318, What? ,Classic
91979, The system must be shut down. No more aliens! ,Classic
133065," Brave heart, Tegan. Now, the androids are programmed to protect that hatch. In order to carry out that duty successfully, it's important they remain operational. ",Classic
144593," No, no. No Chosen One has appeared on the Time of Fire. It can only be the Outsider. Yes. ",Classic
79021, And what will happen to him? ,Classic
2406, Have you hurt your head? ,Classic
18871, Of course I have. ,Classic
77507," No, no, no, I'm sorry, you're quite right, Doctor. Please forgive me. And now, er, would you please run those tests? ",Classic
48743, What are you going to do? ,Classic
31728, Leave him alone! ,Classic
52561," Oh, I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting. Now, where were we? ",Classic
84837," The Air Force will soon have obliterated those creatures out there. The Brigadier, he's in charge. ",Classic
98572, Changing form? ,Classic
138592, If only I could remember. ,Classic
45925, Victoria! ,Classic
23463, We didn't find the man who's supposed to look like the Abbot. I was bringing Steven back here when he got away. ,Classic
105770," Quite so, quite so, and I don't believe in mythical sea creatures either. ",Classic
132142, It's an electrical emission from a piece of scientific equipment. Not something you'd expect to find in seventeenth century Earth. ,Classic
41339, But why did they just turn and leave? They had us at their mercy. Why? ,Classic
8934, Good evening. ,Classic
83920," The ambient temperature suits me fine, thank you. ",Classic
6952," Yes, you will have to. ",Classic
159778, Will you obey me this once? I'll explain everything when I return. ,Classic
81016," Hurry, it must be eradicated! ",Classic
37807, Chameleon 419. Taxi Clearance. ,Classic
147403, I assume he is still on the planet Telos. ,Classic
24112, Quite sure. It was they who reported it. ,Classic
19848," Softly now! All-seeing Zeus, you see into our very hearts and know their secrets? ",Classic
145028," The Trions have agents on every civilised planet. An agrarian commissioner on Verdon, a tax inspector on Darveg, and a very eccentric solicitor in Chancery Lane. They'll know, all right. ",Classic
118899, Is that why you always win? ,Classic
832," Huh. Like stone, look. Very brittle stone. It crumbles when you touch it. Look. ",Classic
53661," Do you want to be left here with Vaughn and Packer? Now go on! Get going. Come on, now. Watch yourself. Easy.   Hang on to the ladder tightly. Whatever you do, don't let it go. And don't look down either! Right, Isobel, now you. ",Classic
93633, But would you do it? ,Classic
81725, Is the girl here? ,Classic
77815," Well, lucky for him. Otherwise the shock of the change would have finished him off. ",Classic
26323, And aim to continue. ,Classic
25761," Exactly, dear boy, exactly. Therefore, I had to imitate the Toymaker's voice to make them obey me, and they did. ",Classic
140523, The Dark Tower. ,Classic
30020," Oh, good. Ow! Oh! ",Classic
117298," Open your eyes, Doctor.   Are they in there? ",Classic
119708," Count, do you realise what will happen if you try to go back to the time before history began? ",Classic
33227, What? ,Classic
44092," Come along, then. ",Classic
155855, Doctor. ,Classic
4925, Yes. ,Classic
62901," My dear man, it's a perfectly simple piece of machinery. ",Classic
18762," You are right, Doctor. We are ready to disconnect. ",Classic
91346, Wait. The doors.   Sarah. ,Classic
57964," Oh, Jamie, would you move this cylinder out of the way? ",Classic
133568, It's a massacre. ,Classic
80628," Silly question, but why are we looking for an air duct? ",Classic
130446, Then where? ,Classic
333,"   Oh, dear, it's disgusting really. ",Classic
81599, I'd better get down there. I want to handle the preliminary interrogations myself. ,Classic
30066," Where will we go to now, Doctor. Will we go forward or back in time? ",Classic
26726," I've seen 'im. Old acquaintance of mine, Marshall of Dodge City. Name of Virgil Earp. ",Classic
8402, Dead? ,Classic
32703," Polly, take the swords. That's the style. Now, back against the wall, both of you. Go on! That's better. Now, I'm going to have a look at the wound. Come along, come along, let me see. Yes. We're going to need some clean water to bathe the wound. Ah. ",Classic
130055, Because he doesn't want to upset you yet. ,Classic
101044, How can you tell? ,Classic
56552, Just a minute. I think I'm getting something. ,Classic
144661, Give me that component immediately! ,Classic
64869, That Doctor's even volunteered to pilot the recovery rocket. ,Classic
107188," Don't talk like a fool, Colby! You're not a fool! ",Classic
39400, Do not touch the instrument. ,Classic
23812, I saw his body lying in the street by the Abbot's house. Before I could do anything Roger Colbert saw me and sent the guards after me again. Heaven knows what I do now. ,Classic
74088," Hepesh, you have already had your say in the Grand Council. The question has been discussed and decided. ",Classic
29475, I came here to tell you that we found   You! you're the one that kidnapped the Doctor.,Classic
152336, Couldn't we just go back to the Tardis? ,Classic
29049, We'll decide that when we get the loot. ,Classic
111786, You have the money? ,Classic
104026," Oh, Casey. Don't ever do that to me again. If the celestial Chang caught me trying to pinch his tricks. I had an idea that his dummy was a midget dressed up, but it's just an ordinary vent's doll. ",Classic
4261," Oh, dignity. Yes, of course. Now, take my arm, friend. ",Classic
141088, You're hardly a suitable candidate. ,Classic
63119, I insist that you take some positive action. ,Classic
124776," Well, Decider Draith was dragged into the swamp. What have the marshmen got against you? ",Classic
73652," For every guerilla cell that you destroy, another one springs up. They have stolen your time machines and copied them. They steal your weapons, your explosives. ",Classic
102571," Go now, and do my will. ",Classic
123460," No, it can't be you or the Doctor. I'm the only one who can go in the Generator while it's unstable. ",Classic
9099," I can read, thank you, jailer. And where are you going now, citizen? ",Classic
161166," As my lady knows, before I entered your service I was found guilty of a large number of offences. ",Classic
160270, Perhaps. Time will tell. It always does. ,Classic
74750, Hepesh! ,Classic
62029," Please, please help me! ",Classic
75922," Look, let me make one final attempt to negotiate. ",Classic
46953," Tried to get out over the surface, but there are Yeti everywhere. And there's this fungus and fog, all around, you see, and it's hopeless! I tried to get back to HQ, I tried, but all the stations were locked, you see, and I couldn't get back in. And all the time I kept seeing more and more Yeti, and they were closing in on me. I was retreating. I was always retreating, and then, at last I found I could get into Piccadilly, but when I got down there, there was this machine and that Professor, and a girl. And more Yeti. They're everywhere! ",Classic
40101," Now there is a distinct element of risk in what I'm asking you all to do, so if anyone wishes to leave they must do so at once. Not you, Jamie. ",Classic
54716," No, I suppose not. ",Classic
20365," Well, the whole fleet has sailed, and now there's not one to be seen. They've all gone home. The war's over! ",Classic
103158, Bring that! ,Classic
92667," Oh, no offence, no offence. Do you mind if I take a close look at that?   I' d say it's not a product of human technology, eh, Vural? ",Classic
151601, Idiot. ,Classic
141897," Alive, well, and trying to escape. Would one of you mind keeping watch, please? ",Classic
133900," And that is an order, Adric. ",Classic
31481," Well Fred wouldn't suit him, would it. ",Classic
147900," Wait, watch and learn.   If I do get it open, what happens to you? You can't leave here. The warmth in the corridor will kill you. ",Classic
120672," Have a care, Doctor. ",Classic
94852," You know, these things always remind me of three legged spiders in Wellington boots. ",Classic
157734," We track you down the Carrydoors, creep in when the Chief Caretaker left and bundle up these others. ",Classic
94812, To see me? ,Classic
91038," Oh, it's out of the question. You said he refused to harm you, didn't you? Yes, well, I gave him my own brain pattern. He has my principles, my ideals. ",Classic
45283, You know the switch? ,Classic
69446, Yes? ,Classic
1271," What do you want? But they said you were, but they called you. But you're not. You're perfect. ",Classic
50926, Well if we knew we might be able to put them out of action. ,Classic
88826," That's right, your Majesty. And if your try, every man, woman and child on Peladon will oppose you! ",Classic
96358," If I knew I wouldn't ask. Don't be obtuse, man. ",Classic
7527, Susan. ,Classic
155990, But he hasn't had time. ,Classic
47058," You mean, all we've done is cut off its contact with Earth? It's still out there in space somewhere, flying around? ",Classic
4068, She must have run away. But why? ,Classic
143951, I don't think we should wait for the ambulance. ,Classic
26918, There's nothing there. ,Classic
42626," I trust no one, Doctor. Not any more. Human emotions are unreliable. I'll just go and see that the working area reserved for you in the Medi-Control Centre is ready.",Classic
118480, Intruders! Intruders! Exterminate! Seek and locate! ,Classic
68109," Yes, more or less. ",Classic
39430, Bring the Doctor. Obey! Immediately! ,Classic
148452, I don't know what that is or even what he says. ,Classic
81493," They have just found the cargo ship, Madam President, but it is not responding to signals. ",Classic
106626, But it is there? ,Classic
121190, Yes. ,Classic
43864," All right, what do you want? ",Classic
4382," Distinctly, Messer Marco. ",Classic
13357," Well, I haven't got one. ",Classic
81329, It vanished. It just vanished. ,Classic
116353, Right. ,Classic
132495," Lady Cranleigh, please. ",Classic
3526," My lord, look. ",Classic
145213, Safety precaution. I'm allergic to certain gases in the praxis range of the spectrum. ,Classic
32881," Now, we keep a supply of food here. Oh no, there's only one wheat biscuit. ",Classic
109524, You come with me. ,Classic
11996, I went back and an explosion. ,Classic
95586, You are going to scan first? ,Classic
144336," You have not won, Doctor. ",Classic
24100, Commander? ,Classic
32527, Valmar! Where is the Dalek power? ,Classic
139861," Welcome, our demons. Name yourselves. Can this be Lilith? ",Classic
5330, My name is Tarron. I'm an interrogator in the Guardian Division. You feel well enough to talk? ,Classic
88841," Doctor, that was your trial. ",Classic
64148," It could have been an excess of electricity in the Mars Probe solar batteries. If Lefee and Michaels died on take off from Mars, there'd be no one to control the power build up in the solar batteries. ",Classic
159219, And the living creature was created to keep you prisoner. ,Classic
33287, Who is this man? ,Classic
42800, Is that it? ,Classic
137305, Jo Grant? ,Classic
9839, I think so. At least this storm will allow him to pull up in front of the prison. ,Classic
161144," Why, I can change the world. ",Classic
148848, Strange? ,Classic
78606," That that's the most cruel, the most wicked thing I ever heard. ",Classic
25567," Yaroo! It's right over here. You won't find it so easy this time, you know, because you see, you'll be playing against me!  ",Classic
160945, That way danger. ,Classic
133480," If the Doctor returns, call me.   I don't want to be out there any longer than I have to. ",Classic
115468, I thought you'd escaped. ,Classic
92840," No, I did it for us. ",Classic
115831," Of course, the plant is fully automated. The computer controls the orbit shot, but we like to double check. ",Classic
59641," Yes, all right. I will. ",Classic
111800, It'll be easier this time. ,Classic
111490, There is a great demand for planets that are completely unspoiled and so central. There are very few of them coming on the market today. ,Classic
70531," Oh, no. No, I've been doing all this work for fun. ",Classic
106754, Yes. ,Classic
158367," Well, I'll do whatever I can to help, Delta.   That's Ray and the Doctor. They're sure in a hurry. ",Classic
128818," Not up to CAA standard, but a landing's a landing! Castrovalva can't be far. ",Classic
96593, Scarman came here through the time-space tunnel. It's a two-way mechanism. ,Classic
75993," Now Jo, listen to me. In a few minutes time, I'm going to create a diversion. Now, as soon as it starts, you try and get Hart and the others out. ",Classic
10462, Yes. ,Classic
61820," This machine registers the electrical activity of the brain. Normally the line fluctuates considerably, even when the patient is unconscious. ",Classic
92369, That's the trouble. ,Classic
139072, Mister Mate. ,Classic
29415," I'm sorry, old son, but I'm not taking any risks. You may be what you say, but then again you may not. ",Classic
110593," Ringleader, sir? ",Classic
26207, All you gotta do is gun down Earp and Bat Masterson. You all set to try that? ,Classic
70680," Even if the mining combines do come, they can't drive us out. We were here first. ",Classic
56503, Thank heavens you've come. ,Classic
124460," I have regained control, master. Tardis has stabilised. ",Classic
113954, I'm not sure I'd entirely agree with that remark. ,Classic
134791," For the new to be born, the old must die. The new order of the Xeraphin has begun. ",Classic
49884," Well, it would be as well not to miss then, wouldn't it. ",Classic
149260," Afraid so. Not just me, either. ",Classic
46344," Staff! Glad to see you're all right, sir. ",Classic
118634," Attention, attention. The action we are about to take is your responsibility. It will cease only when you agree to total surrender. ",Classic
126569, They're only people. ,Classic
111998," Oh, you heard that. Well, it wasn't much of a heresy, my friend. Just a little thing. ",Classic
65632, I've sent for a drilling consultant. A chap called Greg Sutton. One of the most experienced oil men in the world. ,Classic
126620, I thought you might. It's ridiculous. Space contracting? ,Classic
68123," Well, er, they're handing out daffodils. ",Classic
75464, What the devil's going on? ,Classic
152583," Or, it seems, a lift by a transporter to this place. ",Classic
71505, I don't know. ,Classic
151409, You disappoint me. I expected more from you than this. ,Classic
108279," Well, even Gatherers have their bad days. ",Classic
30564," But we cannot live with you. You're, you're different. You've got no feelings. ",Classic
19873," Well, something has been here. Look. ",Classic
37618," Aye. They've not harmed you, have they? ",Classic
163808," I'm sorry, Doctor. ",Classic
134337, No Plasmatons. ,Classic
5989," Oh, he designed all this, did he? ",Classic
127263," Kassia, help us! ",Classic
12646, She wouldn't fetch any price at all at the auction. She's to be taken to the circus and thrown in the arena.,Classic
67341," Sorry to disturb you, Doctor. I just popped in to say goodbye. ",Classic
56224, Why? You've done without a chat for a good many years. ,Classic
86410," Yes, that's one of the few good things about the entire situation. According to my patrols, they seem to vanish. Just disappear. No one sees them come, no one sees them go. ",Classic
14967," You are right, my lord. His treachery is well-paid by Saladin. He is a Saracen spy. ",Classic
105687, It's all right. Back in a tick. ,Classic
78578," Well, I've got to risk it. He's got to be stopped, but that's no reason to put you into any danger. Now once I go out of that door, I want you to close it, all right? ",Classic
134301, The intelligence. It's using Nyssa as a medium. ,Classic
88266, Many times. They refuse to listen. ,Classic
37808, Chameleon 419. Taxi following southern taxiway for departure runway 27. ,Classic
30019," Come on, ducks, we're nearly there. ",Classic
137530, Where? ,Classic
82440," I can't get her back on course, sir. One of the drive outlets is malfunctioning. ",Classic
138530, We must make it materialise fully. ,Classic
133270, The captain is about to come on board. ,Classic
119319, I was right. ,Classic
63330, May I ask why not? ,Classic
160319, Ace. ,Classic
128866," There's more blood here. And there, and there. ",Classic
101010, It's all I shall need. ,Classic
100297, Yes. Kill all who try to escape. ,Classic
155148, What do you mean? ,Classic
160871, Her name is Ace. ,Classic
135023," Where to now, Doctor? ",Classic
22022," bigger than Fairbanks! Well, don't just stand there, ",Classic
50404, Er. ,Classic
88021, What is it? ,Classic
47015," You, the Intelligence? ",Classic
6190, The High Priest of Sacrifice has spoken. I shall remember his words. ,Classic
10701, You wait here then. I'll go and wet my handkerchief in the river. ,Classic
95740, Time? ,Classic
159278," Excellent. Yes, Mel can keep you out of trouble, Glitz. ",Classic
99107, I win. ,Classic
144598, My dear Doctor. So relentlessly predictable. ,Classic
88864, Hmm? ,Classic
35449," But I'm better! Oh, my head. ",Classic
28791," Well, my dear Sir Charles, we can soon find that out, can't we? Would you mind just standing back for a moment? Now, my dear Ben, just carry out what I've asked you to do.   It's quite safe, gentlemen. ",Classic
5291, We have no alternative. ,Classic
138513, Where's the light coming from? ,Classic
21630," Can you work it, Doctor? ",Classic
118239, We've arrived. ,Classic
143984, I don't know. ,Classic
164036, Professor. Josiah's lucifigus. ,Classic
85844," Yes, well, the definition of the word humanity was always a rather a complex question, wasn't it? ",Classic
29541, Squire! Squire! Here! ,Classic
62684," Lethbridge-Stewart, what on earth is the point of my trying to discover things for you if you keep turning them down all the time. ",Classic
95265," Sorry, I'm not with you. ",Classic
158637, I have been entrusted to deliver certain secret documents which nefarious unnamed parties would stop at nothing to grasp within their own grubby digits. ,Classic
67987," Telephone engineer, sir. Just finishing. ",Classic
80123," I don't think I'll write it up in the University journal, not if I want to keep my job. ",Classic
28473," I can't tell you now, Duchess.   Look, keep back, Polly. I'm telling you, come on. ",Classic
112544, Balaton? ,Classic
139261, They transferred home. ,Classic
2156, How do we do it? ,Classic
79836, That's charming. ,Classic
107413, Well of course it matters! We Time Lords are a very meticulous people. You have to be when you live as long as we do. All information is recorded. ,Classic
141354, We made it. ,Classic
27430, Point one zero. ,Classic
44847," Are you getting on with your work? Mustn't fall behind, you know. Come on, Colin. We all get depressed. I know how you feel. ",Classic
6362, And next time you will honour your promise. ,Classic
106286, He's our specialist in extraterrestrial pathological endomorphisms. ,Classic
31880, You're the Examiner. Or maybe you're not. ,Classic
130916," Well, play along with him, son. He means well. ",Classic
26020, Now you can borrow mine. ,Classic
68520," From the position of the body, tinge of the skin ",Classic
123216, Does she mean they're sterile? ,Classic
163032, Looks fishy to me. ,Classic
44927," Will you? How? No. I think the time's come for you to answer my questions, don't you? Come here, girl! If you don't, I shall have to shoot one of you. Oh, not a mortal wound. In the leg, perhaps? ",Classic
4341," You will not believe this, but I swear it's true. They're playing backgammon for your caravan. ",Classic
119424," Florence 1505. I am waiting, Doctor. ",Classic
101466, Why did you come back here? ,Classic
3083," And neither do you, young man. ",Classic
138627," If you can return the lever, I can disconnect the computer controlling it. ",Classic
8844," The other prisoner, which one is he? ",Classic
63696, Fair enough.,Classic
8578, We're not going to hurt you. ,Classic
78929, You promised. ,Classic
165375, How long since I was here? ,Classic
87376," You'll do as you're told, Sergeant. ",Classic
152759," Your crude sarcasm is also noted. I should warn you, Doctor, that your hostile attitude is not helpful. ",Classic
29995," Ha. Heard of Avery's curse, ay? ",Classic
19153," At last we're near a solution. We must waste no more time. Now you two, get the boy up to the table. ",Classic
157219, I wonder if Blue Kangs behave like this.,Classic
92281, But you could leave the Ark and go on. There's plenty of room in the galaxy for us all. ,Classic
143074, I can't hear anything. ,Classic
140161, Find these demons and bring them hither. ,Classic
101704," I've no data available, but his body's on the point of collapse now. Low blood pressure, shallow respiration, carbon dioxide increasing. He can't last much longer. ",Classic
90440," Stay, girl. Tell us. What has been happening? ",Classic
111660,   Highness? ,Classic
165556, Go away! Get away from here! Get away from here! ,Classic
16014, I beg your pardon? awful noise? That's no way to talk about my singing! ,Classic
98211," Yes! It's here somewhere.   No, it can't be done, Morbius. There would be severe pain, there would be seizures, perhaps even madness. ",Classic
12839," It has its responsibilities. Official poisoner to the court of Caesar Nero. Yes, very responsible. ",Classic
48728," Well, that's funny, it's changed to night now. ",Classic
125592, Doctor. ,Classic
56318," Doctor, that's splendid. Thank you. ",Classic
96827, Come. ,Classic
160225, Danger! Instability! Reaction out of control. ,Classic
12178, You killed Sandy. Why? What made you? ,Classic
135400, Damon! ,Classic
129020, Adric told you? ,Classic
33906, The food. It couldn't be anyone else but Zaroff. He led the field in producing food from the sea. His progress is astonishing. ,Classic
121398, Oh? ,Classic
25001, So you still think that you can pit your mind against mine? ,Classic
118995," Time, Count. It will take time. ",Classic
139540, Do you know what that is? ,Classic
14113, Escape is impossible. Impossible. ,Classic
148033," If you recall, last night I was supposed to have a cold supper. ",Classic
156855, Causing the death of a Tetrap. ,Classic
9402, She's here. We were arrested together. ,Classic
31708, So do I. Excellent. excellent. ,Classic
18482, Then we have no chance of survival. ,Classic
64793, Taltalian was acting under Carrington's orders. Quinlan explained that. ,Classic
127752, Yeah. Telephone for help. ,Classic
161758," Nice rocket technology, Doctor. ",Classic
79616," So, the mere fact of our being here should cause a colossal explosion. ",Classic
18794, Oh! ,Classic
162305," They're coming to take me to the ring, Bellboy. They may need you to repair the robots, but I'm just trouble. Making a bit of a mess of opening the door, aren't they? It can't be that difficult. ",Classic
2500, Keep an eye on Susan? ,Classic
144889, At last. ,Classic
71582, Yeah. ,Classic
117144," Warm for the time of the year. It's a little trick I picked up from the fire-walkers in Bali. They do it all the time. Come on, old boy. ",Classic
152670," I have a bomb and I would like to explode it. Not only will it destroy Davros' Daleks, it might just catch him as well. ",Classic
17044," They're fine. Now, Vicki, remember the Doctor's device? Well it worked! The city's on fire. Look, you can see! ",Classic
48278, What is it? ,Classic
33653," Oh, this is really too much. ",Classic
139885, How long are you planning to stay? ,Classic
80443, Hey! ,Classic
88070," Well, don't prolong the agony. It's obvious you mean to kill us. Why don't you get on with it? ",Classic
119529, What are you talking about? No one can achieve everything. ,Classic
79170," Thank you. It looks as if Tyler was right. That light beam or whatever it is, seems to have scanned the Earth like a searchlight and picked on us. ",Classic
885, Then why don't we know where we are? ,Classic
54271," Yes. Emotion is alien to the Cybermen's nervous system. It'll destroy it. The micro-monolithic circuits. They're emotional circuits! No wonder they weren't logical. Now why didn't I think of this before. Now, let's see. ",Classic
91752, What is it? ,Classic
55607, Check exhaust time. ,Classic
88680, I've a message for you from the Doctor. The Queen has agreed to meet you in secret. ,Classic
1461," Insulate. If you are right, Doctor, about the Daleks taking up power from the floor, this is a perfect way of putting them out of action. ",Classic
113609," Yes. That's why our mission is so vital. Romana, the Key of Time is so powerful that it must not be allowed to fall into the hands of any one being. It's been broken up into six segments and the segments scattered through the universe and disguised as other objects.",Classic
124838," Oh, I think I can organise something. ",Classic
38825, You just asked me about Victoria Waterfield. ,Classic
164030, It will pass. ,Classic
157763," Ah, the opening's not important, Bin Liner. Wind it on. ",Classic
148166, Too quick. It would be over too soon. We'd never be able to sell so swift an execution. ,Classic
62582, Hmm. ,Classic
143947, I was wondering when the ambulance for Tegan would arrive. ,Classic
46484," Volunteer? That's a dirty word, that is. Not me. ",Classic
35259," The error detectors show a slight discrepancy, in normal limits, though. ",Classic
159377, The effect of the blast? ,Classic
109783, Why wouldn't the Doctor let me go with him? ,Classic
22777," Oh, for heaven's sake, we'll go carefully. Look, Steven, just because the Doctor isn't here don't think that you're the only one who can outwit the Daleks. ",Classic
159807," With respect, Group Captain, your career's magnificently irrelevant. Now, let's see. Any more transmission sites? ",Classic
145717, Stage three of what? ,Classic
103749," Yes. It undermines a certain type of personality, causes identity crisis, paranoia, sometimes even personality disintegration.   Robophobia. At least, that's Grimwade's theory. Hold this. ",Classic
132146, Here's an old friend. ,Classic
39194, Why did you risk your life to try and rescue me? ,Classic
127291, The Doctor and his young friend. ,Classic
39454, You will wait here. ,Classic
128402, I'd rather be with the Doctor. ,Classic
417,   My matches. Where are they? I must get back. Must get back to the ship. ,Classic
34642, That's in another ten minutes. ,Classic
146930," So many. Ah, it all begins to make sense. ",Classic
70802," Well, it isn't up to me. They'll have to sort that out at Earth Control. What are you up to? ",Classic
47669," My wife is ill. Get out of my way, man.",Classic
59093," Well, how? We can't stop him if we're locked in here. ",Classic
148231," Hmm? Oh. I suppose if we use the emergency power booster to bypass the failing circuits, we could just reach the planet of Varos in the constellation of Cetes. Question is, when? If we miss their mining era, we'll be stranded for evermore. ",Classic
127852, It looks just like yours. ,Classic
139035, You're not going with them? ,Classic
102101," Andor, please listen to me. I am not the Evil One. I am a traveller, that's all. Your tribe has obviously been visited by travellers before. ",Classic
78545, Can't hold! It's running away again! Start decreasing power. ,Classic
17791," Oh! Mr. Taylor! Where are you with that string, dear boy? ",Classic
52107," Go on, get her out. ",Classic
32142, Dalek sixteen complete. ,Classic
158131, Do you mind if we rest at the camp until we get the bus shipshape? ,Classic
155684, Millions of miles from anywhere and we're completely isolated. ,Classic
5354, All right.   Open your side. We're coming out. ,Classic
145729," Yes, well, we'll attend to that just as soon as I've got that android off the base. ",Classic
104229," Emma Buller, his wife. She disappeared last night. Does Mister Chang by any chance do a vanishing lady act? ",Classic
148149, We must arrange good riddance of this bad Governor soon. ,Classic
37491," Well, you see. They give out these cards and get the kids to write home to their parents before they go. Then the Chameleon Tours lot take the cards abroad and they post them back to Britain. ",Classic
17086," What for? What would I want to be back in their time for? I want to be with you. Doctor, you've got to help them. ",Classic
12579, The what? ,Classic
145654, We'll soon put a stop to that.   Major Salateen! ,Classic
110300, Stop! ,Classic
23411," Oh, a long time. Two years about. He was arrested for heresy. ",Classic
91280," Yes, sir. ",Classic
98512," This way, Mister Dunbar. ",Classic
93063, General Ravon. ,Classic
61662, What the dickens are you doing there? Have you found any of those meteorites?,Classic
60769, There's troops moving in from all sides. ,Classic
134341," Scientifically speaking, I think we should find the others. ",Classic
35110," Well, I went out to get Jamie some water and when I came back I saw this giant man or creature or something just going out of the door carrying one of the patients like a doll. I think it was a Cyberman. ",Classic
9903," What do you mean, close the doors? ",Classic
146415," There's nothing we can do, Remus. Just carry on. We daren't stop now. ",Classic
24756, Very well. We will do as you suggest. ,Classic
79435, The invisible man. Antimatter. ,Classic
55034, It's almost impossible to believe. The Krotons have always been our good friends. Our benefactors. ,Classic
61198," Doctor, this is also a matter of your own survival. Unless I can convince the War Lord that you will help us ",Classic
110400, What? ,Classic
133258, Our deep space probes have identified the Tardis. ,Classic
135152, Water. We're below sea level here. Stop the pumps and Amsterdam would take up its stilts and float. How'd you like it? ,Classic
16367, Yes. ,Classic
71096," Yes, we're going to send for an Adjudicator. ",Classic
27619, You can destroy the people of the city. They can destroy our enemies. The strangers must be gods.,Classic
10411," And Susan and Barbara, I want you to call out to me what you see written beneath you.   Yes, yes. This is the insecticide quite clearly. It's a bit rough, of course, but it tells us the story. ",Classic
151068, It worked. We're still in one piece. ,Classic
120350, I suppose he is dead? ,Classic
84578, Cliff? Old Jones the Milk says they're going to blow up the mine. ,Classic
119590," Well, what news? ",Classic
116569, I think it's gone. ,Classic
140749, You will accompany us. ,Classic
134763, He's become a Plasmaton. ,Classic
134510," Well, Doctor? ",Classic
55427," To fight the Krotons? Listen, I've just been talking to the stranger, the Doctor. He made me realise how pitifully little the Krotons tell us. ",Classic
56004, Nothing ever goes wrong while you're on duty. ,Classic
139520, Shall we return to the party? ,Classic
137244, It's outside. Let me help you. ,Classic
35733, But he was in the medical room! ,Classic
57873," No, no, I'm not, General. This is clearing up a whole heap of things in my head. I can lose every floater I've got and your fancy Space Corps won't do a thing about it. But the government loses one government beacon and that's a different matter. Then you come running. That's what you're here now for ",Classic
133935, This is Captain Urquhart again. ,Classic
60891, What happened? ,Classic
9061, Hello. ,Classic
126581, You won't get the Doctor's help by pointing guns at him. ,Classic
103866," It's all right, Mister Jago. Please, come with me. ",Classic
131485, Now what are they up to? ,Classic
109109, Seventy metres! ,Classic
78351, Don't you start. You'd be the first to clobber me if I muck things up. ,Classic
79798, Time Lords? ,Classic
1841, All you're doing is playing with words. ,Classic
121194, That's right. They incinerated an entire planet. Someone's found another source. ,Classic
115107, You're not thinking of going there alone? ,Classic
162155," Yeah, you do that. Make sure you find her. ",Classic
33497," If I could see my Kirsty again, I'd die content.",Classic
108146, Strange. I feel fear. Why should I be frightened? ,Classic
129419, An Earthling. ,Classic
12348, What are you going to buy at the market?,Classic
34914, This way. ,Classic
13069," Good, good, good. And the lions will go hungry after all, eh? ",Classic
60729," Don't fail us, Smythe. The War Lord is here and he doesn't like failures.",Classic
21986, What? ,Classic
13184," Oh, it isn't fair, Ian, is it? ",Classic
7931," We can't stay here, Susan. ",Classic
118916, What will happen if ,Classic
129166," Well, sir? ",Classic
83684," Yes, of course. ",Classic
143083," Yes, I think so. ",Classic
161597, Doctor en passant behind Cyberleader. ,Classic
86460, It's weird seeing London like this. All those deserted streets. ,Classic
37843," That can only mean one thing. It's crashing, too.",Classic
38550, Right. ,Classic
52626," Oh! Oh yes, of course, you are the Princess Rapunzel. ",Classic
65079, Fuel injection systems now functioning normally. ,Classic
157840," As himself, yes. But you saw what happened. I mean, up to now Kroagnon's simply been a mind without a body, as your parents must have left him. However, I fear he may have spent his time down there devising a way of performing corpoelectroscopy. A way of transplanting his brilliant brain to some host body. ",Classic
158716," You won it playing cards. Doctor, it's a waste of time. He won it in a card game. ",Classic
48153," Precisely. And the engineers who cleared it must have touched it, yes? ",Classic
35361," What, like the space plague? ",Classic
13647, Can you live up there? ,Classic
99609, Yes. ,Classic
46665, Yes. ,Classic
92171," Advanced technology. Gypsies used to believe that the eye retained its last image after death. Not so far out. No, it's not going to work. Switch off, Lycett. ",Classic
93393," I have tried. Time and again, I have tried. But now they will be satisfied with nothing other than total annihilation of the Thal people. ",Classic
62438," Well, facilities to repair the Tardis, laboratory, equipment, help from Miss Shaw here. ",Classic
20792, I've been reading the reports on the previous meetings here. The Daleks have evolved a most interesting plan. ,Classic
165907, I think you'll find things quieting down now. ,Classic
158342, Could it be hidden? ,Classic
57139, Fine. Then there's no time to be lost. ,Classic
134914, Ah. Not a good idea. ,Classic
84344," May I remind you that I answer to Geneva. Under Article seventeen of the Third Enabling Act, the ",Classic
12917," So, you've had a busy day, Vicki? Hmm? ",Classic
8652," You see, they lie! ",Classic
2673," If, of course, they'd like to confess to me what they have done to my ship, I may even change my mind. ",Classic
99404, I'm deputising. ,Classic
51975," Jamie! Jamie, over here! ",Classic
52407, You desire your liberty. ,Classic
87744, You've what? ,Classic
140656, These thunderbolts are everywhere. ,Classic
98381," Oh, nothing, nothing. A mere nobody, but I don't think you're in the first rank any more. ",Classic
80113, Sir? ,Classic
54525," Loud and clear, sir. Over. ",Classic
45471," If there had been a current running through these rails, you'd have been fried! ",Classic
46040," Yes. Well presumably, once the sphere started working, the Intelligence just homed in on it. ",Classic
100039, Anywhere we know? ,Classic
73935," Oh, there are books. Even during the wars, people found time to study, to write about it. ",Classic
14136," Thank you, thank you. ",Classic
64330," Looking after you all right, are they? Have you had a cup of tea? ",Classic
24038," Yes, it is. I bet if you go down that path there, you'll come to the American Bison and the Tea Bar. ",Classic
103067," First we find the Tardis, then we have a little scout round, and we'll be back before they know. ",Classic
37262, Further call for flight BR129 to Geneva now boarding through channel B at gate number 19.,Classic
44594, Wait. The file. ,Classic
143777, A lot has happened during your imprisonment. ,Classic
60995," We are going to bring a new order to the galaxy, one United Galactic Empire. ",Classic
38591, Kennedy! ,Classic
54675," Right. We must stop them. Brigadier, Brigadier, this is the Doctor. Can you still hear me.",Classic
153351, I am not a liar! ,Classic
119623," Yes, sir. ",Classic
8001, And this treatment you're giving him is in order to close down that veil? ,Classic
127804, Three point six seven metres normal to the back surface. ,Classic
128192," Yes, there does seem to be some positive development. ",Classic
134756," Well, this can't be it. ",Classic
59482, You were sent to meet us! ,Classic
63361," Well, we don't know. Maybe there are thousands. ",Classic
25734, So we can't leave. ,Classic
53405," Oh, Travers was getting past it a bit, you know, and Anne persuaded him to go to America with her. ",Classic
41279, Have you given Travers permission to leave the monastery? ,Classic
100706, But if your hypothesis is correct ,Classic
25582," Ladies first, if you don't mind. ",Classic
77611," Well, why not? ",Classic
17188," Oh, maybe. ",Classic
28527," Well, look at you, you're nearly on the ground. ",Classic
52530," How very fortunate. Do come in, Doctor. I've been expecting you. Oh, don't be alarmed. Won't you walk into my parlour? ",Classic
138265, He doesn't care about Bor. ,Classic
88036, Psychological warfare. I'm trying to destroy the city's brain. Engineer what in human terms is called a nervous breakdown. ,Classic
14218," Come along, child. ",Classic
142013, Will it be fast enough? ,Classic
153862," Er, you're not going to like this, Mister Glitz. ",Classic
144617, There's no one alive on this planet. ,Classic
86037, What's that? ,Classic
102605," A variation of it, yes. ",Classic
67480," Oh, dear. Don't go away, Doctor. My co-ordinates seem to have slipped a little. Still, not bad after twenty nine thousand light years.   I do hope you can spare a moment or two, Doctor? ",Classic
122215, Good girl. ,Classic
5910," Autloc. Well, he said we were the servants of Yetaxa. Is that who they think you are? ",Classic
117559, The Tardis! ,Classic
46616," Evans, when I want your opinion I'll ask for it. ",Classic
95045," But who? I mean, why would anyone want to knock out the entire village? ",Classic
45411," Oh. Oh yes, that'll do, Jamie, I think. Just get that in there and that'll be excellent. There we are, that should work. ",Classic
39919, These controls are of their earlier dynasty. ,Classic
2804, We're safe now. ,Classic
99221," Not at all, not at all. ",Classic
10125," Doctor, I think the cat's losing interest. ",Classic
57450, You'll just have to be patient! ,Classic
61347," But you don't understand! Oh, very well, but don't say I didn't warn you. Right then, we must return to the 1917 Zone and find the Tardis, and make good our escape. ",Classic
138899, We stay. ,Classic
122417, Sensors detect hemispherical defence shield. ,Classic
152500, Bring that woman to me. ,Classic
10129," No, I'm afraid not. ",Classic
132733," I agree. All right, put the troop on full alert. ",Classic
83258," Good, because the business of command is not for a machine, is it? The moment that we forget that we're dealing with people, then we're no better off than the machines that we came here to destroy. When we start acting and thinking like the Daleks, Taron, the battle is lost. ",Classic
37132, There you are. We've got to get you to the airport building and you'll be safe. ,Classic
29511," Oh, aye, indeed, it could be so. ",Classic
133963, So will I. ,Classic
72452," Look, Miss Hawthorne, I agreed with you from the first about the danger, but now I think you're utterly mistaken. Whatever else you saw it certainly was not the Devil. ",Classic
98752, So what? There'll be nobody left to use it after we're finished.  (And drops the equipment on the floor. The radio crackles into life. ,Classic
162265, Quiet. Where's the Doctor? ,Classic
131662," The android's armed. If it wanted, it could destroy us ten times over. ",Classic
71954, In one of the dwellings a few miles from the dome. There was a lot of stuff there that the Primitives have stolen. ,Classic
73268," That's right, Jo, I mean a ray gun. Only it's far more sophisticated than any weapon yet invented on Earth. Now take a look at this.   Quite an effective little weapon, eh? ",Classic
85223, Getting married? ,Classic
151117, Hi. ,Classic
64721, This could take a long time. ,Classic
37911, The machine in the Medical Centre? ,Classic
16665, Success! Paramount success! It is impossible to distinguish from the original. ,Classic
45354, Why is that light flashing? ,Classic
18626, All right. You said it would take hours to charge this ship properly. ,Classic
101124, Who is Rokon? ,Classic
74068, This stuff's too unstable. There just isn't time. This is something that I must do myself. Now get out! ,Classic
18804," Yes, I thought I'd get some fresh air. Somebody opened the door and ",Classic
55563," Quick, Zoe. Up there. Run! ",Classic
22892," Yes, but that Dalek must know that the representatives got away. ",Classic
38989, Don't play with me. ,Classic
98154, It is even lower! ,Classic
24304, I must go. ,Classic
89870," Ah! No! No, stop. ",Classic
135122, I'll deal with it. Perhaps we should delay until I have. ,Classic
86375," Yes, as a matter of fact, I think I have.   Hello? Who are you? ",Classic
31214," Hello?   Hello? Is there anyone there? Hello? Hello? Why don't they come?   Ah, so you've come at last. I'm from Earth. I'm the Examiner. ",Classic
81182," One trusts the removal will be speedy. According to that Lurman, the ferocity of the Drashigs is formidable! ",Classic
123034, Why has it got to be? ,Classic
58787, Maddie. Madeleine. ,Classic
195," Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. By the way, Susan, I managed to find a replacement for that faulty filament. It's an amateur job, but I think it'll serve. ",Classic
156689, Inquests bore me. ,Classic
82890," Ah, you, my friend. You may be a very brilliant scientist but you have very little understanding of people, particularly yourself. Courage isn't just a matter of not being frightened, you know. ",Classic
67029, Listen to that! Do you want to end your lives fighting like animals? ,Classic
26532," Well, as soon as we've had breakfast, my boy, I must check up with Mister Werp and ask him if he knows where they've all gone. ",Classic
81928," Truly, Madam President, I sympathise with your position, but my government has sought these criminals throughout the galaxy. ",Classic
149401, Don't argue. Move! ,Classic
20534, Has Cressida played me false? Very well. I'll fight my brother's murderer for I only live to kill Diomede. ,Classic
66342, Would you care? ,Classic
135168," Oh, come on. It's only a pump house. The worst that can happen is that we're caught by the police. ",Classic
99789," You are blessed, my child. Few have the honour of serving the mighty Demnos so totally. When the Moon rises over the southern obelisk, your hour of glory will have come. Cup. ",Classic
63751," Come in, gallery five! Come in, gallery five! No good, sir. The line's gone dead. ",Classic
134375, By the power of the Great One. In the deserts of Arabia I learnt all the magic arts. ,Classic
90610, Yates! Mister Yates! ,Classic
62051," Yes, what results can you expect with this primitive equipment?",Classic
14864," I'm afraid not, my dear. No, history must take its course. ",Classic
25337," Useless. No sign of a door handle, latch, or lock. We're stuck here. ",Classic
8281," No, we didn't think you did.  1 ",Classic
150576," Come on, then. Let's get out of here.",Classic
122787, Wait a minute! ,Classic
106093," Shuttle relief crew. Shuttle relief crew. Come in, please. Shuttle relief crew, this is Supervisor Lowe. Please report. Relief crew, this is the supervisor. Where are you?   My God, what's happened? Hello? Hello?   What is it? What's gone wrong? ",Classic
117613," Probability, then. ",Classic
129239, It still makes sense to Mergrave. Stay behind him. ,Classic
27376," Look, the people in the city are just men. You can fight them. ",Classic
152882, I said be careful. ,Classic
69329, Exactly. Any questions? ,Classic
161401, From ever putting the three bits together. ,Classic
59036," No, this is much more difficult, I'm afraid. ",Classic
109694," Quiet! Quiet, everyone. Come on, here.   Now listen to me. I want you to stay calm, and when I say, go quickly but quietly. Ready? Take this little one. Off you go now. Come on. Come on. ",Classic
34735," Jamie, we must go back. We've got to warn the others. There must be another turning. ",Classic
59786, It's a Mills bomb. It's all I could find. I thought we might hang it on the front of the safe and let it off. ,Classic
13833," Yes, it appears they have gone to the plateau. ",Classic
82277, Look! ,Classic
53703, Operator? ,Classic
147681, The woman is unharmed. Telos is cold. She must have warmer clothing. I have kept my word but you have deceived us. ,Classic
61819, EEG? ,Classic
49704, I'll authorise the extra power. ,Classic
104103, No plan of the sewers? ,Classic
122721, Is it very bad? ,Classic
77262, Your scientific advisor? ,Classic
111538," Sleeping on duty's a serious offence. If anyone comes, you can wake him up. ",Classic
47385," Yes, it was locked. ",Classic
32783," Yes, sir. ",Classic
157389, I am the Chief Caretaker. ,Classic
147064, But you don't understand. Here we have a fine craft to take us away from here. Far away. ,Classic
98932, But why should people go to such lengths to get their hands on the pod? ,Classic
145943," I'm relying on you, Stotz. What about the others? ",Classic
23974, We've landed. Your mind is made up? ,Classic
47397, You said you were stung or something. ,Classic
85816," With Sir Edward's treasure I shall hire more men, and with Linx's weapons to arm them, who shall stand against us? ",Classic
84297, How do you know it leads to the surface? ,Classic
10761, I found a couple of them down by the river. Open targets. ,Classic
151063, What has he done? ,Classic
77826, And that is? ,Classic
59150," We did it! We did it, Dom. We're all right. We're down, Dom. ",Classic
11531, Susan! ,Classic
27457, It's a perfect transfer. ,Classic
55917, Set the transfer link.   Final phase on automatic. ,Classic
165109, I doubt if any creatures can walk through iron shutters. ,Classic
69906, That's our only chance. ,Classic
81659, Or they're showing a misguided loyalty to their Draconian masters. ,Classic
9643, Yes. I am James Stirling. ,Classic
4745, What about them? ,Classic
85510, We could cut Sir Edward's soldiers down in less time than our rogues spend with their breakfasts. ,Classic
19448, What do we do now? ,Classic
111806, You're sure he didn't miss it? ,Classic
123515, But Brock ,Classic
19135," Yes, but it is the voted verdict. There is nothing we can do about it. ",Classic
62729, Pretty sure. He wanted to see the exact place where the accident happened. ,Classic
68210," I'm not bluffing and my hand, as you can see, is not empty. If you kill me, you will destroy the dematerialisation circuit from your own Tardis. You recognise it, I feel sure. ",Classic
85614, Your freedom if you kill him. Stand back! ,Classic
8486, Treachery! ,Classic
162978, My lady. ,Classic
31128, What happened? Where have you been? ,Classic
62266, What are you going to do now? ,Classic
115812, And spare ammunition? ,Classic
124731, Or we could just look out through the door. ,Classic
102758, Yes. How long have I been out? ,Classic
68776," Out. Get him. You're not going to give me any trouble, are you?",Classic
134481, What? ,Classic
135736," If I charge the transduction field, the Matrix itself will be isolated. No one could use it. ",Classic
28483," Polly, what's happened to you? ",Classic
141526, Why? ,Classic
131946, The Tardis will not be necessary. ,Classic
85112," Well, I should have guessed. It's the same fungus that killed that maggot. ",Classic
110079, Stop! Stop or I'll fire! Stop! ,Classic
49536, Why? ,Classic
60674, And I brought that secret here. ,Classic
78535," Okay then, let's have a stab at it. ",Classic
95125, Shush. A bug. ,Classic
583, Susan! You stay here with me. ,Classic
128920," A man of great wisdom, sir. He reads thoroughly the books I merely rearrange. I'm sorry you will not dine with us tonight, but sleep. The meat served cold tomorrow will taste the better for it. ",Classic
26991," Yes, and I was right. They are very highly developed civilised minds. ",Classic
157117, Why? It's great. ,Classic
62071," Here, what are you doing? ",Classic
10903, They're not getting me. I'm going to try something. You with me?,Classic
132608, That he isn't lying. ,Classic
104242," It was over here. Here, this is where it was, down here. ",Classic
26902, He said five minutes. ,Classic
74658," Jo, do you realise how dangerous and complex this situation has become? Hepesh could still bring Peladon to his way of thinking, and if that happens, he'll have won without a fight. ",Classic
127877," Yes. Someone's been here before us. Stay here, Adric. ",Classic
19248," Yes, I know, my dear. It's pretty hard for you to understand. ",Classic
7872," You see, he knows his name. Now you stay with him. I think he's getting better, and I'm sure you're going to have a great future between you, later on. Now, after my little exploration...",Classic
47836, You mean human beings? But what happens to them? ,Classic
162337, Yes. Even our own kind. That was after Kingpin was no longer Kingpin. Something went. Something went with him and ,Classic
153409, How can that be possible? ,Classic
53966, Now you really believe that these Cybermen things are down in the sewers. ,Classic
65789, Because of all that. I wonder where I was exactly? Where I was going? ,Classic
114335, I beg your pardon. I beg your pardon. What's the Megara? ,Classic
39784, Doctor. ,Classic
29531," Yes, escape! ",Classic
79472," Now steady on, Sergeant. ",Classic
2141, What about this one? ,Classic
47831, I think you better listen to me. I think you'd all better listen to me. Large formations of seaweed have been coming up on the beaches along this coast. Seaweed that shows clear indications of having life like human beings. ,Classic
149741," Doctor, our races have become tired and effete. Our seed is thin. We must hand the baton of progress to others. If I can raise the Androgums to a higher plane of consciousness, there's no limit to what that boiling energy might achieve. ",Classic
154797," Well, think of the chaos if we remove their mind control. And you'd have a very willing army to fight the Mentors. ",Classic
42213, This is a man! ,Classic
136705," Nowhere, Mother. Just exploring.   Ambril has been showing me around, haven't you. ",Classic
147853," You know Lytton, don't you. ",Classic
96169, He's got to be stopped. How long to impact? ,Classic
134456, I don't think so! ,Classic
41463, What are you going to do? ,Classic
101423, APrydonian. ,Classic
153066," Sent him, did they? ",Classic
120782," We're all rich once we get this metal out of here. Now come on, hurry. ",Classic
151151, Then it seems that we are at war. ,Classic
105038, Is Bent Face dead? ,Classic
17816," Yes, my boy, yes. And history will be ",Classic
154147, Hmm. Yuk. ,Classic
78689," Maybe, but he has come to learn that it is well to obey me. ",Classic
135883, And what about her cousin? ,Classic
144612, If only we could work out how. ,Classic
105890, Where's Leela? ,Classic
89641, Very well. ,Classic
116962, Of course. ,Classic
89356, Om. ,Classic
136263, We don't know nearly enough. Without more information we are simply blundering around in the dark. ,Classic
26530, And I didn't want to have to shoot you neither. ,Classic
17585, What? ,Classic
6613, She spoke against our teachings. ,Classic
126244," What, for midgets? ",Classic
117058, I am. Am I? ,Classic
31184, What are we going to do? ,Classic
135508," Thank you, Hedin. I much appreciate all you've done. ",Classic
144250, For destruction! ,Classic
62110, And this didn't attract anybody's attention? ,Classic
28344," Now what kind of a welcome's this for a bloke what's just come out the hospital? I won't say nothing, Boss. Here what is this, a nut house? Here, you keep away from me! ",Classic
14357, We can't wait for his moods. ,Classic
115945," All I'm saying is that you're not ready to fight yet, and if you stay here, you'll get trapped and stand no chance. But if you split into smaller groups and spread your people across the swamps, they'll never hit you. ",Classic
67228," You can see he's not dead. The Doctor's been ill, sir. ",Classic
163522, The battle's not over yet. ,Classic
80267," Not a sign of the beast, Major. Who are these people? ",Classic
40596, He's too weak to get in. ,Classic
36624, As you please. But I think you're going to run into trouble. ,Classic
20827," Good, good, good. ",Classic
73893, I am a senior government official. ,Classic
141682," The controls are locked. It can now only be opened by the bridge.   Let him go.   Stay on guard, Sergeant. ",Classic
109211," No, Doctor. ",Classic
107701," I didn't know, your Honour. ",Classic
148569, I noticed your cameras weren't broadcasting. A real execution would have been broadcast. ,Classic
21787, Over here. ,Classic
31307, It had nothing to do with me. ,Classic
81990," It's fantastic! I mean, our people seeing Draconians, Draconians seeing Earthmen. I can't believe it. ",Classic
112303," Ingenuity, Highness. Sheer ingenuity. ",Classic
79581," Jo, we're dealing here with a creature of great intelligence, and superior intelligence and senseless cruelty just do not go together. ",Classic
7374," I very much doubt, my child, whether they can see in the semi-darkness. ",Classic
68461," Yes, of course it is. I mean, you've just seen Barnham. ",Classic
86758," Well, at least we've learnt something, Brigadier. Somebody inside this organisation is working against us. ",Classic
54938," Look, we are friendly. ",Classic
151599, It appears you have a lackey with a conscience. ,Classic
4881," Yours? Well, aren't I coming? ",Classic
8745," He'd have got out of that house, Susan. I know he would. ",Classic
124630," Yes, but we still haven't worked out what's wrong with this. ",Classic
46776, So? ,Classic
50428," Just a crude, box-like structure. Shall I summon the Quarks to destroy it? ",Classic
153751," Well, there must be some other way in. ",Classic
127523," The Doctor is under sentence of death, Keeper. ",Classic
8238," Oh, would you, Carol? Thank you. ",Classic
99245," Er, yeah, just go straight ",Classic
153286, No need to hurry. It's gone. ,Classic
73382," Security forces are standing by. If we do get the coordinates, what are your instructions? ",Classic
165317," Workers of the world unite, comrade. ",Classic
10982, Suppose we forget all this blab about Bedfordshire. Have either of you seen this? ,Classic
69681, His usual threats. ,Classic
72408," Well, Doctor Reeves said that we shouldn't move him. ",Classic
85425, Miss Smith? ,Classic
37939," Would you rather be destroyed? Keep an eye on her, officer. Bring him along. ",Classic
102745, Destroy! Free! ,Classic
39844, He seems to know all the answers. ,Classic
85388, I am. ,Classic
83478, There we are. Are you ready? ,Classic
89044, Then it's up to us to get a message to the Federation and tell them what Azaxyr is up to. ,Classic
22212, What about the subject? ,Classic
29944," What would you have him say, Cherub boy. ",Classic
88630," Yes, in a minute, Sarah. Sending for Federation troops is the one thing that is certain to make things worse. Well, I only hope I can get things sorted out before they arrive. ",Classic
36202," Well, we've got to do something to help in the Colony. We can't just eat their nosh without helping out. ",Classic
65150, You are on board our spacecraft. Open your hatch and leave the capsule. ,Classic
274, They say you sit all day rubbing your hands together while he brings us meat. ,Classic
80192," Oh, Jo, do come on. ",Classic
127148, Is something the matter? ,Classic
70254, You know these creatures. Is there anything we can do? Anything at all? ,Classic
46605," Yes, what is it, Evans? ",Classic
70490, Bill! ,Classic
52601," Oh, am I glad to see you. ",Classic
112763," That's the Bridge, up there. ",Classic
122540," It's quite a powerhouse, isn't it. ",Classic
87453, We seem to have got a mains power ,Classic
114804," Oh, I see. ",Classic
151925, She's threatening me again. ,Classic
27422, Standing by. ,Classic
136410, Hmm? ,Classic
60876," If there was any way of helping him, I would. ",Classic
112341," What are you doing, alien? The Ice Gods ",Classic
6423, So that's why the Doctor prepared a thorn for you. ,Classic
10406," Couldn't we lever it up in some way, stand back and look at it? ",Classic
107044, Of course. ,Classic
86902, He's heading towards the Cabinet room. ,Classic
5059, Help me! Help me! ,Classic
113186," And so are you. We need not delay your death any longer. By the curl-ed fangs of the sky demon, I've looked forward to this moment.",Classic
54375," We've had the jeep. We'd better get out of here, out of the back way as quickly as possible. ",Classic
108806," Goodbye, Veet. ",Classic
136925, Who will challenge the Mara? Who will pluck the Great Crystal of knowledge from between the Mara's jaws and set us free? ,Classic
117146," Oh, that's all right. We all make mistakes sometimes, don't we, K9? ",Classic
9546," Well, not very much, we didn't have a chance. But he'll be here soon, so no doubt we'll get the whole story, several times. What have you done? ",Classic
1143, Perhaps it is a drug. Is it failing them now? Why are these four showing signs of radiation sickness? ,Classic
90968, The imbalance has been corrected. It is not logical that you should feel sorrow. ,Classic
138138," Then I'm asking you, will you take us off this ship? ",Classic
104925, Listen. What's your name? What were you called before you became a Chinese god? ,Classic
161179," Well, in strictly linear terms, as the chronometer flies, I've known since November the twenty third, 1638. ",Classic
45224," You and me. What use are you to me? You were useful once, but now. ",Classic
89387," Oh, really? Well, I can't say that I did until the Doctor explained this morning. ",Classic
69419," Ah, come to give yourself up? ",Classic
57299," No, Jamie, I think this is just the place. ",Classic
139164," It's the key to the rum locker. Look, I've got to go, but you've got to stand by me, lad, like I've stood by you. We've got to chuck the grog over the side. The boys'd never go aloft without it. ",Classic
10115," Yes, what's happening here? ",Classic
135938, The biggest explosion this part of the universe is ever likely to witness. ,Classic
164212, Control wants her freeness. Be a lady-like. Doctor promised. ,Classic
86924, You must have been talking to Miss Smith. ,Classic
1789," Be careful what you're doing up there, Susan. ",Classic
112530," Well, according to these space time coordinates, we have arrived at precisely the right point in space at precisely the right time. ",Classic
144677, The planet's covered in them. We use them as shortcuts. ,Classic
151265," Through his lackey, Maylin Tekker, he's provoked war with the Bandrils. ",Classic
36727," Rah, rah, rah! ",Classic
88645," You have the freedom of the Citadel, Doctor. Be thankful you are not in a prison. ",Classic
105142, Foghorn. ,Classic
46245," Come on, I'll tell you as we go. ",Classic
153446," From the present data that we have, that would seem a logical presumption. ",Classic
153313, I thought we hunted the Doctor. ,Classic
69292," Thank you, Greyhound seven. Maintain surveillance. Over and out. ",Classic
80641, Signals? ,Classic
81739, We need to know how you came to work for the Draconians. ,Classic
97290, It all makes sense now. ,Classic
26202, Now I don't care what Wyatt Earp said. That man's not Doc Holliday. ,Classic
113799," Well, girls, time to pack up. Thanks for all your help, Romana. Fancy a mug of tea and some sandwiches? ",Classic
43840," Yes, there are other very strong influences though. Oh, I could do it in time. But what if I did? What then? ",Classic
103055," What? Robots don't need chairs, and certainly not padded ones. ",Classic
68535, I wonder how many deaths it'll take to convince them?,Classic
135641, Yes. We have all the proof we need. ,Classic
146622, You've got the Tardis. You still know how to operate it. Take the Lieutenant to the palace! ,Classic
55874," Well, you didn't have to kill them to do that. ",Classic
128258, Father! ,Classic
73151," Oh, no, I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm still rather busy. ",Classic
162648, It didn't sound like a shell. ,Classic
62735," I've collected all the equipment I can lay my hands on, and I've alerted the local rescue team. They'll mount a follow-up search as soon as they can. ",Classic
143785, Keep trying. ,Classic
84149, Who is this? ,Classic
104971," Excellent. This is good strong linen. It should do fine. Well, don't just stand there wasting time. Get me a bucket of water and break off that gas pipe. ",Classic
57620, I hope.,Classic
66246," I think you should for yourself, sir. It could be important. ",Classic
79102, Yes. Pass me a silicon rod will you? ,Classic
88080," Well, it's not much consolation, but at least they don't have the parrinium. ",Classic
4313," Charming indeed, and yet there are moments, old friend, when we wish our character were more like that of our lamented grandfather, Genghis. Did you hear of him? ",Classic
77651," Oh, they're larger than ours. ",Classic
59180, General Hermack is coming back here to pick me up. I have to go back to home planet. ,Classic
66427, My rank is Platoon Under Leader. ,Classic
19101, That won't stop me from coping with it.,Classic
30769," I know, but I'm not at all certain what would happen. ",Classic
103803, Never mind. Comfortable? ,Classic
15835," Yes, please, yes. I wonder if you'd mind taking it in for me. Inside the ship. Thank you. I just want to fetch Vicki. ",Classic
120984, We just met. ,Classic
40193, Just a moment. Are we all going down? ,Classic
14003, We'll wait. Make sure the Doctor has got to the control section.,Classic
30028, Yes? ,Classic
83722," But Jo, that's only one little world. There's so many hundreds of others to see. ",Classic
79185," Tyler? Yeah. Yes, that was its second mistake, here in this laboratory where I usually work. And its third mistake was Bessie. ",Classic
97762," No, no, no. So would you please do as you've been instructed? Hurry.   He's an excellent fellow, very devoted to me, but his intelligence is not the highest. ",Classic
15543," By making a nuisance of yourselves, that's all it is. ",Classic
98536," Crikey, I feel as though I've got frostbite already. ",Classic
164783," I think this is what you're looking for, Doctor.",Classic
14140," Heron, will you come back to Vortis? ",Classic
150659," It's just round the next corner, if I remember rightly. ",Classic
165500," Darth Vader, the brain-dead plumber? Flo? ",Classic
94236," Are you going to die now, or are you going to tell us where that pentalium drive is? ",Classic
70092," Yeah, that's where the alarms coming from.",Classic
10489, What's the matter? ,Classic
12890," Yes, yes, I rather thought it might be.",Classic
93580, We don't have much of a fighting force. ,Classic
88752, I don't know. Maybe they just wanted to stop you using it? ,Classic
98526, I'm only seven hundred and forty nine. I used to be even younger. ,Classic
4744, No. Certainly very different here. You notice that man's eyes? ,Classic
102545, What is it? ,Classic
97635, An android? ,Classic
155781, I hope this is relevant. ,Classic
88533," Believe me, your Majesty. Chancellor Ortron has totally misinterpreted the facts. ",Classic
55719, But he followed you. ,Classic
80153, Here? ,Classic
145956, What do you mean? ,Classic
36120, We don't want to know what the strangers think. ,Classic
111322," The Key to Time is a perfect cube, which maintains the equilibrium of time itself.   It consists of six segments, and these segments are scattered and hidden throughout the cosmos. When they are assembled into the cube, they create a power which is too dangerous for any being to possess. ",Classic

66240, There's no such thing as a minor detail at the drill head. ,Classic
2866," Oh, the heating as well. Everything's gone to pot.",Classic
62652," No, Major Baker, you may not. The Doctor is my personal responsibility.   ",Classic
46678," Strange, it's not picking up. The Intelligence must be transmitting. I wonder why it's not working.  Aha! Success! It's going, Anne. ",Classic
58948, He wouldn't do! ,Classic
165735, Don't be a fool! ,Classic
143539, Can I get to my room? I feel sick. ,Classic
52478," No! No! Stay where you are!   There's an electrical gadget round here somewhere which sets off an alarm gong. I walked through it, the gong went off and they set a gang of robots after me. ",Classic
3175, Bad enough. I must attend to the horses.,Classic
64456," Come on, Doctor. I'll keep you informed, sir. ",Classic
64450, I can see your reasons for concern but you have got the capsule back now. ,Classic
97112, Report! Report! ,Classic
147379, You were capable. ,Classic
95211, And we believe it's been destroying these oil rigs. ,Classic
109890, Then you must trust your instincts. ,Classic
92873," Invasion? Oh, you mean Styre? ",Classic
96237," The Earth isn't my home, Sarah. I'm a Time Lord. ",Classic
87747, The creatures on this planet are primitives. They don't count. ,Classic
15292, How? ,Classic
113347," Listen, you and Mula stay here and cover us. The rest of us, the engine room. ",Classic
34285," Well, speak. ",Classic

96435, That's right. We've all been dreadfully worried about you. ,Classic
27588," Tell me, how will he use it? ",Classic
153133, I have heard of Gallifrey. An advanced civilisation. ,Classic
159378, No. A projected energy weapon. ,Classic
92175," I know. Two more leads, Rogin. ",Classic
14929, How did you get in here? ,Classic
61615, So Control didn't think they were meteorites either? ,Classic
104861," The time key, Doctor! ",Classic
5967, It shall be done. Is he to assist at the ceremony of the Rain God? ,Classic

127014, The Fosters have searched the grove for the stranger's craft. ,Classic
97809," You put that away. This will be no crude butchery. A head such as this, a head that will soon command the universe, must be taken with care and skill. Every step must be planned. Every suture, every small incision has to be perfect. This will be my great triumph, Condo. A thousand years from now, people will remember Solon's last and greatest operation. ",Classic
55827, We'll help you into it. ,Classic
56338, Sir? ,Classic
14266, You have some very fine materials here. ,Classic

160809, I can't. ,Classic
111526," Sholakh, this planet is ideally placed for use as a forward base. But to give it a technology, to train primitives in a thousand skills, to raise a battle fleet with which to conquer our homeland would be the work of a lifetime. ",Classic

76676, When will this signal come? ,Classic
83526," Right, put it on.   Well, Jo, do I pass? ",Classic
40805," Is this where we're going, Detsen? ",Classic
97998," No, thank you. We've had one taste of your hospitality. All I want from you, Solon, is a professional opinion. Sarah's been blinded. Examine her eyes. ",Classic
108594, Everyone would believe it. ,Classic
18966, The fifty seventh. ,Classic
119750, We must do something to stop him. ,Classic
9543, And where's Susan? ,Classic
25071," Steven, look at this! You can see right through it. It's not a real blindfold at all! ",Classic
121785, Never mind about us. We know who the smugglers are. ,Classic
119645, What are you talking about? ,Classic
51606, That's going to be tricky. ,Classic
73012, Obey me. ,Classic
25354, Thank you. ,Classic
141117, They made it! They made it! ,Classic
151462, A small barricade in front of the door wouldn't help? ,Classic

76446, During the hours of daylight no human can survive on Solos without an oxymask. The soil contains a nitrogen isotope unknown on Earth. The ultra-violet rays of the sun cause a kind of poisonous mist.,Classic
123309, Does that conclude the evidence? ,Classic

154807, Guard! ,Classic
112750," Oh yes, it is. If my guess is correct, Romana's in much greater danger than Pralix. Now, how do we get to this Bridge? ",Classic
16825," That cliff above, can we climb out that way? ",Classic
21411," Borkar! Borkar, where are you? ",Classic
76674, What signal? ,Classic
4766, What's happened? ,Classic
8399, We came to find you. ,Classic
145295," Signals, sir. Trau Morgus is on Vid. He wants to speak to you immediately, General. ",Classic
87871," I saw them too, Doctor. Do they mean anything to you? ",Classic
61755, I'm positive we've never met before. ,Classic
149039," You're forgetting. We didn't just stumble into this place, we were hijacked. ",Classic
49479," Coming in to loading bay, Control. ",Classic
146078," Oh, never mind about the clothes, they're easily changed. What about me? ",Classic
153766," Oh, that's it, isn't it? Hubris! ",Classic
113671," Just stones? Yes, they're just stones. They're all aligned with various points on the horizon, giving you sunrise and moonrise at different times of the year. ",Classic
12036," Yeah, we need to be careful. These people are dangerous. ",Classic
585, Silence! We're going back to the ship. ,Classic
164595, Can we crack them? ,Classic
20486, Did you want something? ,Classic
44350, It's a pity we can't get him to the Doctor. ,Classic
61979, Ah ha! But it will for me. ,Classic
115366," True, but I should not find one who pleased me so much.   Go now, before he arrives. ",Classic
122157, Sounds like the Tardis. ,Classic
19170," Doctor, our virologists are willing to give you all the help you need. Can you describe the virus responsible? ",Classic
39379," Go? Called? Go where? What do you mean, go? ",Classic
668," Za has gone with them, taking them to their cave. Za takes away fire. Now I, Kal, lead. Go! ",Classic
92009, I don't understand. ,Classic
9057, Oh? ,Classic
141804, Check the damage to the other computers. ,Classic
15270," Oh, you're just saying that because we followed your advice. ",Classic
20078," No, thank you. I couldn't eat another mouthful. How on earth do you manage to live like this when you're under siege? ",Classic
86299," Right, on your feet! Prisoners, forward.   Prisoners numbers one seven double seven eight oh, one seven double seven eight one and one seven double seven eight two, sir. ",Classic
61961, Wrong key.,Classic
92707, And we reckon that that circle of yours has got something to do with it. ,Classic
117956," But her records are, on your computer. ",Classic
17310, Take them to the village.,Classic
140636, The Tomb of Rassilon. That's where we're going. ,Classic
59589," Yeah, but why were you kidding ",Classic
597," Please, show me. Give me your handkerchief. ",Classic
101513," Let me put it to you. Could the accused have said, 'Let me go, I will kill him'? ",Classic
33944," But I do. Professor Zaroff, if anything happens to them, you'll never know the secret I was going to tell you. ",Classic
105121," You said I would like Brighton. Well, I do not. ",Classic
63468, Now you don't really believe that. ,Classic
80314, I'd say it was very much a part of the ship. A great lump of ,Classic
6980, John? ,Classic
4587," A precise distribution of weight, that's the key, isn't it? ",Classic
76833," Ah, there you are. ",Classic
50043, Aye. Just you take it easy. ,Classic
7818," Well, gentlemen, there's a poison at work here. I know the signs. Now what you must do is to test samples from each and every district. Where did that come from? ",Classic
65850, I know. ,Classic
139341, Where's the Doctor? ,Classic
39215," You have been dreaming, Mollie. Dreaming that there are mysteries in this house, that all is not well. You have dreamt that you heard the voice of Miss Waterfield. But it was all your imagination. It was nothing but a dream. Do you understand? ",Classic
71583," Quite flat. Wriggle away. That's it, wriggle away.   Come on, Right, that's it. Stay there. Right, give me your hand.   Good. Well done, Jo. Right, now let's see what we can find before the Master gets back.",Classic
156947," Really, this is not the place for double entendres. ",Classic
19041, What will happen if one does? ,Classic
124609, My brother says it's a myth. The Outlers all think the Deciders are lying. But I've seen it. ,Classic
70348, Who knows. ,Classic
93033, What? ,Classic
155105, And what about you? ,Classic
53889," I must know, Rutlidge. You must tell me. How long? How long before the UNIT forces can take action! ",Classic
141626," We shall neutralise the Sea Base whatever happens, and with the help of Maddox we'll destroy all vital circuitry to do with missiles and communications. ",Classic
2694," Oh, a mere harmless sleeping drug. ",Classic
159237," You're talking in riddles, Doctor. Proamon is my home planet. ",Classic
140701," It depends on what may try to stop him, my boy. Oh, it's not without reason that it's called the Death Zone. Great heavens. Two more traces. ",Classic
72110," Yes, and all since they started digging up there on Devil's Hump. ",Classic
145191," Now we're near you can see they're not caves, they're blow holes. ",Classic
118478, Despatch units four and six to investigate. ,Classic
45207," Come on, man. Can't you increase the power? ",Classic
31472, Someone's been listening to what we were saying! ,Classic
104658," This pig thing is still alive. It needs an operator, of course, but the mental feedback is so intense that somehow the swinish instinct has become dominant. It hates humanity and it revels in carnage. ",Classic
36877, It will not last long. Only for four minutes. By that time you ,Classic
49349," Yeah. I had a check made of the stock but then I remembered I'm holding most of it over in the Power room. Well, you know how much we rely on those Bernalium rods. I mean, they're the only ones that stand up inside the X-ray laser. ",Classic
91849, Clearly a regressive. His speech patterns prove it. How did he get here? ,Classic
136475, I do assure you it is most important. Where is the Great Mind's Eye? ,Classic
103544, You cannot escape. You cannot escape.   You cannot escape. ,Classic
51722, Fantastic. ,Classic
20957, No. ,Classic
130378," Mister Sanders, are you going in that machine? ",Classic
45739," Taking a bit of a risk, aren't you, sir? ",Classic
69986," Your freedom? The bargain, you remember, was that if we spared you and your Tardis, you would lead us to this planet in return for the death of the Doctor. ",Classic
65681," Getting a respectable tan, bingo! I get snatched off a drill rig in Kuwait just when I'm sure we've made a strike, flown back so fast my stomach's still over the Med and I still haven't the faintest idea what I'm supposed to be doing here. ",Classic
148372," Oh, what was that thing we saw? A creature from my worst imaginings. ",Classic
100294, When did I ever guess wrong about anything? ,Classic
136508," No. No, I understand. ",Classic
49972, Angle change. Ten degrees. ,Classic

134841, What? ,Classic
120081," My lady, I beg you. No, please, no! ",Classic
5744," At least you're with me, Altos. ",Classic
131247, I suppose everything will have to be entered into the log. ,Classic
122410," Don't worry. I have a feeling if we don't find him, he'll find us. ",Classic
19609, It is ready for firing. ,Classic
164651," Oh! It's like electric.   No, leave it. I don't like it. ",Classic
68480, Rats? ,Classic
27546," The strangers, girl, where are they? Tell me or you will suffer. ",Classic
105478," I'm sorry, sir. I reckon I made a bit of a fool of myself just now. ",Classic
49820," Take over what? We're invaded. We have no contact with Earth, we're in the path of meteorites. Take over what? How do we fight without the laser? ",Classic
5710, No! ,Classic
15885," Oh, wonderful. I've always wanted one. ",Classic
128762, Thirty one seconds. ,Classic
146426," Worse? Yes. Yes, well, perhaps you're right. The purpose of reconnaissance, after all, is to gather information, not to finish up face down in a pool on one's own blood. Especially blood as noble as mine. We've found out what we want to know. ",Classic
43834," Well, I must admit, Doctor, you do look like him. ",Classic
55037, How is she? ,Classic
1298," I mean, if they call us mutations, what must they be like? ",Classic
157458," For about a minute and a half. You see, that's how long the prisoner needs. ",Classic
8326," Yes, and what he told us is terrifying. ",Classic
68317, What makes you so sure? ,Classic
139314, You're right. Take the woman to Mister Marriner. ,Classic

58741, Do you think I haven't anticipated that? ,Classic
27381, What do you mean? ,Classic

98326, Is it right that we should let the Doctor fight our battles for us? ,Classic

44815," Then you'll be perfectly free to arrest us and put us in prison, won't you? ",Classic
110730, What? ,Classic
23978, What did you say? ,Classic
90549, And I. ,Classic
69282, That's right. ,Classic
85850," Yes, that's right. And my people are very keen to stamp out unlicensed time travel. You can look upon them as galactic ticket inspectors, if you like. ",Classic
143220," No. Because you had all the information locked up. If you'd shown us that, then Captain Revere, who with his bare hands held this shambles we called Frontios together, might still be alive. ",Classic
83412," Well, how're we going to do all that? ",Classic
9062," We're slipping out for a while, Barbara. It won't be for long. ",Classic

107320," Well, yeah. ",Classic
147927, We have no way of telling. ,Classic
34564, Come on. ,Classic
147565, Ow! ,Classic
33467," As for you, Captain, you must answer for yourself. ",Classic
135956," I warned you this would happen, Omega. ",Classic
66306," Now look, you two are just wasting time. What I suggest is this. We push all the coolant down the output pipe and then draw up all the debris from the bottom of the shaft through the inlet pipe. ",Classic
64708," I thought you were supposed to be helping me, or do you intend to commit more sabotage? ",Classic
111363, I'm so sorry about that. Is there anything we can do? ,Classic
131915," To get back to your own planet, yes. ",Classic
149297," Jack Ward, you stay where you are! ",Classic
42293," Look out! Avalanche!   Storr, are you alright? ",Classic
140567, I suggest we go and find out.,Classic
23178, But don't you want to know why she was frightened? ,Classic
65223, What you tell me is appalling. The authorities on Earth had no knowledge of this. ,Classic
44963," Oh, Victoria, don't hit me! You wouldn't hit your old friend the Doctor, would you? I wouldn't leave you in the tender mercy of Salamander. ",Classic
154199, Yakety-yak. Talk. ,Classic
151383," Do you want to come out now, Doctor? ",Classic
51716, Something wrong? ,Classic
38064," One moment. Owing to the complete success of our operation, living space on our satellite has had to be used for our cargo. Therefore, quarters will be re-allocated. Report to the accommodation centre for instructions. ",Classic
54831, Where to? ,Classic
144845," You're still resistant. Do not oppose them or my Tardis will never be free. Take the girl with you. She's unskilled, but strong. There's much work to be done. As for the Doctor, he'll die in the holocaust with the rest of them. ",Classic
90047, Don't do that. ,Classic
75979," Well, this circuit here, it's completely misplaced. And also you'll need far more power through to your main dipode. Give me a pencil, will you? ",Classic
26224, Now where in thunder did I put that bottle? ,Classic
23048," Gaston, no! ",Classic
133728, Who is this woman? ,Classic
15524, Look! ,Classic
1878," If you hadn't fought him, I think I would have hated you. ",Classic
153966, Beams that kill wasn't the only thing he had on his mind. Dirty old Warlord. Glad we left that place when we did. ,Classic
67050, I advise you to try. ,Classic
110485, Yes. Expulsion. ,Classic
115786," All right, expert, what's that? ",Classic
123853, Thanks. I think I've almost done it. ,Classic
32843," All right, you heard what the Commissioner said. Nooses off. Get him down. ",Classic
87892, We stay together. ,Classic
139810," While I exist, he exists also, until we are no longer needed. ",Classic
43681, What a terrifying thing. It's like a sea monster. ,Classic
130970, But the Mara. ,Classic
99183," I'm going to find the Doctor. He knows more about this than anyone else. Now, do you know where he is? ",Classic
23424, So that you can get further instructions? ,Classic
80956," No place for the fair sex, my dear. ",Classic
46215," Look, look, you say it can get us out of here? ",Classic
1629, Make no attempt to capture them. They are to be exterminated. You understand? Exterminated. ,Classic
27732," It's no good, Dodo. I'm sorry. ",Classic
30189," Zeus 4 to Snowcap. Strength 8, over. ",Classic
136106," Oh, why? ",Classic
17670, Vikings!,Classic
72081," Now this is Miss Hawthorne, a prominent local resident who's very much opposed to Professor Horner's dig. Professor Horner, I believe you two have already met? ",Classic
110745," The President's office, I suppose. ",Classic
102160, That's the Evil One. ,Classic
83631, Take a look at this! ,Classic
3606," I'm saying, does a magician need a key to open a door? ",Classic
161432," Leader, I must repeat the objection to the transmission of incorrect information. Our forces do not yet hold all three units of validium. ",Classic
128013," Adric, don't argue. ",Classic
31054," What do you mean, Mondas? ",Classic
85820," What, you? Oh Bloodaxe, on my oath, can you see that on a scaling ladder? ",Classic
150709, Las Cadenas.   ,Classic

112587," Er, excuse me! What I'd like to know. Where did you get those jelly babies? ",Classic
119990," No, no, she's not my commander. She's my companion. ",Classic
94328," One thing about you, Harry. You never miss the obvious. ",Classic
9373," So, you thought you'd escaped. Well, we're not as big a fools as you take us for. Ah, LeMaitre. Two recaptured prisoners. ",Classic
74245," Well, I'm glad it was nothing more. You bring a welcome beauty to a serious occasion. ",Classic
62302," Don't struggle against me, Hibbert. Trust me. We must work together. ",Classic
3958, Are you prepared to pay a good price? ,Classic
7823, 1 ,Classic
33444," Oh, no. Not after all that. I give up.   It's you, Doctor. ",Classic
80515, This way. ,Classic
64882, I think I'll be paying two visits tonight. ,Classic
76298, Good morning. ,Classic
161038," It's all working quite beautifully, Helen A, as you can see. A masterful piece of engineering, even though I say so myself. ",Classic
915, I'll see what I can do. ,Classic
153329, Just needed to step out for a breath of fresh air. ,Classic
52721," Jamie, Zoe, get away from there.",Classic
140606," And now, we wait. ",Classic
12560," Oh, yes, they'll wait for us. But for how long? ",Classic
31375," A light. A torch, outside. ",Classic
108966," Yes, I'm a Time Lord. ",Classic
115560, My lord. ,Classic
33445, Who else would be walking around the jetty at this time of night dressed like a soldier who'd been wounded in battle? ,Classic
20293, So they will be. I shall be there with my Ithacans. ,Classic
1398, We have planned otherwise. ,Classic
47051, You blithering Welsh imbecile! Why can't you do what you're told! ,Classic
142278, What did it look like? Like this? Did it look like this? ,Classic
87526," He's not good, and we're down to our last pack of sulphagen tablets, Richard. ",Classic
57649," Well, I'm not sure Zoe, but I think we're on an unmanned spacecraft in a fixed orbit. We're too far away from anywhere to be a weather satellite. Let's see what clues we can find through here, shall we? ",Classic
41911," Yes, Master. ",Classic
39926, Do not raise your voice. You will achieve nothing by shouting. You look after the Doctor and I will watch the girl. ,Classic
8390," You're a cheerful soul, I must say. ",Classic
65383," Right, let's get on with that list. ",Classic
81503," All right, Jo, what are you doing in there? ",Classic
105334," If there's any survivors, we'll find them on the east crag. ",Classic
112152, Back to the city? ,Classic
50455, The Tardis could have attracted the radioactivity in much the same way as a magnet attracts metal. ,Classic
95810," You are prisoners, and you are charged with diverse acts of war against the subjects of Morestra. ",Classic
152611, Are you all right? I'm sorry about the DJ. ,Classic
148047, You're the most inconsistent and intolerant man I've ever met. ,Classic
125754, It's about a race of giant vampires. ,Classic
99838, Apologies? ,Classic
23409, And where is Preslin now? ,Classic
95074, Hee. Just after I got here I heard some kind of animal bellowing out there. ,Classic
125621, And you think the same? Will anyone come with me to the Tower? Or must I go alone. ,Classic
16051," Yes. Oh, I could do with a drink. ",Classic
44805, I gave you back that gun because I trust you. Now I want you to trust me. ,Classic
128668, Nyssa. ,Classic
72369," Friend, I hope, ma'am. ",Classic
121280," Yes. I was watching the projection, and then I. Oh. It isn't on anymore. I just felt hot. I must have fainted. ",Classic
48816," Well, she's decided to stay in a good historical period. Very few wars, great prosperity. She'll be happy enough. This is very filling, isn't it? ",Classic
26595," Ho, that Ringo sure works fast. Well, Warren my lad, guess I'm gonna have to leave you in charge after all, huh? C'mon Bat, lets get out to that Last Chance Saloon. ",Classic
136974," A1929 Humber 16/50 open tourer, Imperial model. Do you realise this car has the same chassis as the three and a half litre Humber Super Snipe? ",Classic
33037," Before the judges are ready to try the rebels, we'll have them all safely on plantations. ",Classic
50090," They're going to try and trap the Doctor. Come on, let's get back and warn him.",Classic
38465," Right. Well, I shall want you to keep out of sight. You'd better stay in the house. And on no account are you to talk to Mister Perry about any of this. ",Classic
95500," Sarah, I think we've been left behind. ",Classic
43133," No, I'm against the scientists. ",Classic
17792, Here you are Doctor. I found some. ,Classic
160211," Do not anger me, Doctor. I can destroy you and this miserable, insignificant planet. ",Classic
72522," No, not your mythical devil, Jo, no, but something far more real and far more dangerous.",Classic
56217," Oh, how do you do. This is Zoe, and Jamie, and I'm the Doctor. ",Classic
124510," Forgive me, Decider, but if there is some way we can let science illuminate your inner knowledge, you ",Classic
49298, Does your head ache? ,Classic
97716," I go find food, master. ",Classic
13400," Well, it just went. Into the air, into the ground. Oh, what a cursed place this is. ",Classic
57226, Everything is ready. I shall guide our ships in on the homing beam signal. ,Classic
59337," Now what do we do, then? ",Classic
138517, What? ,Classic
71410," Thank you, Doctor.",Classic
134257," If it hadn't been for the Doctor, we would never have found you. ",Classic
150196, Who? ,Classic
134037," Well, of course we've been in search with Search and Rescue, and as it happens there is a NATO exercise on in this area. But Naval Intelligence assure us that far from crashing, no aircraft even broke cloud cover. ",Classic
73072, To try and make you listen to me. ,Classic
39678, I obey. ,Classic
104053, He was killed by a knife blow to the heart. ,Classic
24814, Course we are! ,Classic
710, They come from the other side of the mountains. ,Classic
83764," Well, this is the space time coordinate programmer. The wretched thing's nearly worn out. That's the trouble with the Tardis. She's getting on a bit, you know, Jo.   Look, must you? ",Classic
45024, I'm sure we'll find proof in the Records Room. ,Classic
90228, Yes.,Classic
41412, Fool. ,Classic
67845, What happened? ,Classic
21487, Am I? It was a safety measure. Unwelcome attention was being paid to the fugitives so you send them to Mira on purpose. ,Classic
2028," Oh, we ought to be going back now. ",Classic
105381, He stayed behind to secure the boat. ,Classic
70261," Yes, there is that possibility. ",Classic
44449, A diversion was caused. There was no one outside the kitchen. ,Classic
7578," No, Carol, no. Remember, his mind is open. He can tell the difference between good and evil people. He's trying to tell us something. ",Classic
8362, Well I can't. Do you mind if I try your invention?  1 ,Classic
132486," I'm afraid it's a little more serious than that, Doctor. ",Classic
78711," Oh, this is the Doctor. ",Classic
57402," Oh, I don't think so. I've rigged up a rather interesting little device here. ",Classic
47885," Oh, I'm sorry, Victoria. Did I startle you? ",Classic
126856, I fear that our beloved world of Traken faces disaster. ,Classic

146116, What do you want? ,Classic
123644, The Randomiser. ,Classic
88596," That the miners are on the point of armed rebellion, your Majesty, and that Gebek is your only hope. He's a moderate. Civil war's the last thing that he wants. ",Classic
26944, You are not alone? ,Classic
148659, And they'll continue to do so. It's the only way we have of assessing the effects of the damage done. ,Classic
25752," Whenever you are, Doctor. ",Classic
27584," If I can get him angry, he might do something rash. Come on, soldier boy, what are you frightened of? You've got the gun. ",Classic
135790," Perhaps, but I would have to enter the Matrix to find out. ",Classic
48176," Oh, how nice to be trusted. But I only hope I am right.",Classic
51197, I submit. ,Classic
98422," Yes, that's what we thought. ",Classic
151486," Of course you can't. It only works when this is switched on. Now, when I time slip, you'll be able to see the image I project and the real me ten seconds in the future. ",Classic
134521, Argh! No more! ,Classic
125278, Why here? ,Classic
105265," You leave that be, if you don't mind, mister. ",Classic
35291," Okay. Right, Joe, nip along to the mess deck, tell Jules and Franz I want them here pretty sharpish. ",Classic
131419, There's nothing broken. Can you stand? ,Classic
110321, Tea is camillia in dried form ,Classic
36363," Ah, he's not giving the orders. He can't talk. ",Classic
6843, We dare not wait. The darkness will come and go. Sacrifice must be made! Kill him. ,Classic
34584," There is no time, Excellency. You must take control now. ",Classic
16616, Contact Skaro. Report our destination to the Dalek Supreme. ,Classic
49480, Ask why. Airlock five is all ready. ,Classic
66463, I didn't think there would be. ,Classic
25679," Is it true, Doctor? Are we bound to fail? ",Classic
82412, Where was this? ,Classic
129178," Everything's in hand. With this tapestry and with patience, there's nothing one cannot achieve. Nothing, Doctor, in this world or in any other. The tapestry has the power to build and hold in space whole worlds of matter.   But I've contented myself with one small, simple town. ",Classic
159535, The burn marks. See them? Well? ,Classic
135615, How did this happen? ,Classic
137015, I need time to think. ,Classic
110772, Don't shout at me. Don't shout. Have you ever thought of taking it up seriously? ,Classic
2701, I counted. ,Classic
89292," Alpha Centauri! Well, what happened? Where is the Queen?",Classic
161287, This is no madness. Tis England. ,Classic

17082, No! No! I will not aid and abet suicide. ,Classic
163485, Mordred? ,Classic
17295, That's a matter of opinion. Want some breakfast? ,Classic
117219, Where's that Doctor? ,Classic
128371," No. Do what you like, Doctor. Logopolis is yours. ",Classic
86379, How did you get here? ,Classic
126690, What? ,Classic
126349, You mean something out there now? ,Classic
107681," Congratulations, Citizen. Your father ceased at one ten. ",Classic
134291," Slave labour, I expect. ",Classic
70021, Negative. Data indicates time capsule unnecessary for success of mission. ,Classic
101573, Splendid. So perhaps you'll be good enough to fetch it. ,Classic
153362, It supports primitive life. ,Classic
164792, The Curse of Fenric. ,Classic
38656, The master? Mister Waterfield? ,Classic
86376," Back! Back, accursed wizard! ",Classic
2345, Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. ,Classic
50487, What! ,Classic
102818, Ah. But that's not my problem. ,Classic
69151, What's it got to do with the Master? ,Classic
35955, Precisely. Who wants to see their face in a pair of suede shoes? What's this one? ,Classic
164643," We return to Norway, the North Way, bearing the treasure. Now, let's see how Doctor Judson is getting along, shall we?",Classic
52249," Well, it's the classical way of getting through a maze. Now, Jamie, tie that to the door will you. ",Classic
110146," Listen, I've discovered the location of the security control room. It's directly beneath the Panopticon area, level three zero. ",Classic
133229," And as this, he defeated us in our attempt to destroy Voga, the planet of gold. ",Classic
69034, What about Miss Grant? ,Classic
73070, Doctor? ,Classic
139001," What do you mean, a funny lot. ",Classic
49660," You don't think I'll be like that, do you? ",Classic
6414," Let me help you. Now that I have proved that I can be the victor, we two can be friends for the little while that you have left to live. ",Classic
101712, A very slight one. His opponent is expending energy in maintaining the reality projection. The Doctor can employ all his own artron energy for defence. ,Classic
441, I do not like what has happened. ,Classic
164729, It's the only way. It's the only way to destroy the evil that's killing your men. ,Classic
162592," What, giving up teaching? ",Classic
74093, Enough! I will not have my Chancellor and my High Priest squabbling on the steps of the throne. ,Classic
126842, How do you do. ,Classic
82102, What about stealing the Tardis? ,Classic
73460, Sit down there. ,Classic
114933, So? ,Classic
160115, What about the massive ground defences? ,Classic
157596," Build high for happiness. But let us not forget what we have to do. We must find Mel and discover the mystery of Paradise Towers, because I've learned enough to realise that its very existence is at stake. ",Classic
135436," Nyssa, Damon. ",Classic
92446, I have no memory of the Earth. ,Classic
25680," No, my dear boy. He's just tricking us into despair. Take no notice of him. ",Classic
119839, Mister McGregor. ,Classic
81405, In pursuit of your ships when they have raided ours! We've been very patient. perhaps too patient. ,Classic
145078, To increase its range. I was building a new and more deadly version. ,Classic
47133, Doctor? Doctor? ,Classic
52007," We set sail from Bristol on May the 4th, 1699. ",Classic
108902," Yeah. Well, the Minyans thought of us as gods, you see, which was all very flattering and we were new at space-time explorations, so we thought we could help. We gave them medical and scientific aid, better communications, better weapons. ",Classic
64087, Ask him if it's definitely Mars Probe 7. ,Classic
86008, Tell him I'm busy. ,Classic
153933, Doctor! Continue. ,Classic
38742, Why do you ask about Jamie? ,Classic
17625," It is. Well, that's strange.   What's it doing coming out of here? ",Classic
84310," Oh, you have friends in high places, have you? Well, so have I.   Stella? Will you get the Minister of Ecology on the phone, please?",Classic
139790, I need you. ,Classic
124791, It is fitting that the citizens believe the mists are dangerous. ,Classic
70718, How long did you say you'd been on this planet? ,Classic
35901," Er, any good asking? ",Classic
78732, He made you look a fool. ,Classic
94086, What's it called? ,Classic
135057, The Doctor was absolutely right. We've been away for a hundred and forty million years. ,Classic
81460, The news services have their own monitors. They probably picked up the distress messages. ,Classic
23864, Of course. ,Classic
12315," There we are, safely down. ",Classic
87881, Our city supports itself in two ways. Through roots in the ground and through the air. ,Classic
162586, Yes. I'll plant it when we get home. ,Classic
133656, You can't fly the Tardis? ,Classic
52064," Doctor. Oh, I'm glad to see you again. ",Classic
44915, On the contrary. I'm going to get everything I want from you two. ,Classic
86643, I'll do what I can. ,Classic
100975, They're in here.   Your weapon's won't work in here. We're in a state of temporal grace. We're multi-dimensional. ,Classic

19730," You will not laugh so loud, I think, when Agamemnon hears of this.",Classic
108703, There! Stop or we fire. Get her! ,Classic
19384," Not sure I would. If they're anything like you, I've seen enough.",Classic
87646," Quick, come on. Out, come on.   Come on, down here. Which way did they come from? ",Classic
132373, Guess. ,Classic
158534," Well, I was marking out where the sonic cone meets the ground. ",Classic
37074, What flight did these people come in on? ,Classic
144723," Will someone help me, please? ",Classic
64803, Miss Shaw? ,Classic
95822," Yesterday, you were found with the body of one of our scientists. Last night one of our guards died and you were seen kneeling over him. Can you explain this? ",Classic
141496, Have you found the intruders? ,Classic
73309," Well, everything that happens seems to centre round Styles' house. ",Classic
130014, My actions were motivated by scientific curiosity. ,Classic
24400, Doctor? ,Classic
140262," You won't win, not ultimately. ",Classic
99932," Oh no, Doctor, it's too dangerous.   We'll take the back staircase. ",Classic
21395, And how do you propose to do that? ,Classic
163296," Ah, you wish to run away. Well, there can be but thirty of them at the most. ",Classic
41470," Well. it's quite all right, Jamie. It's like those three back there. It's either switched off or not receiving. Come along. ",Classic
18746," How much longer, Doctor? ",Classic
94710, The Beacon is approaching Voga at ten thousand light units. It is time for us to leave. ,Classic
111926, They believe in it. The Captain says it never fails. ,Classic
152795, Which sort of unbalanced me. Made me selfish to the point where I cannot stand competition. ,Classic
81805, I doubt that. I prefer to put my faith in the mind probe.,Classic
145464, Thank you. ,Classic
122372, Go on. ,Classic
8026, Why do you listen to him? Why do you follow him? ,Classic
59286," But look, Major Barrington, if only you'd let us get back to our transportation we'd be no further nuisance to you. ",Classic
145283, Couldn't put it more plainly. Exactly how do we cooperate? ,Classic
46584," He didn't help you before, then. ",Classic
93449," Davros, this will create enormous mental defects. ",Classic
147775," We can only exist in temperatures below zero degrees. If I were to venture onto the surface of the planet, I would boil. ",Classic
92482," Power off, Doctor. ",Classic
118653, Just so long as you've got it clear. ,Classic
104574," The Sheffield song thrush. Last time she was here, there were eggs all over the stage. Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is my great privilege to introduce to you, in his extended season here at the Palace, the first of two appearances this evening, someone whose legendary legerdemain has entranced and entertained all the crowned heads of Europe. Here to baffle and bewilder in his eclectic extravaganza of efflorescent ectoplasm, that master magician from the Orient, Li H'sen Chang! ",Classic
145867," Sorry, seems to be locked. ",Classic
157036," Less of the pessimism, Mel. Not all the cards are in the Rani's flavour.   Now, if we were to run a wire from here round to here, then the circuit wouldn't be broken when the bangle was open. Mel. You're the computer expert. How about it? ",Classic
16297," Yes, quite so. ",Classic
111413, Of course! ,Classic
23112," I don't think you're sure. Look, come and drink some wine with us and later I'll take you to the Port Saint Martin. ",Classic
96520," Not chosen, shaped. The actions of the present fashion the future. ",Classic
160216," Davros, I beg of you, don't use the Hand. ",Classic

139788," Tegan, help me. ",Classic
591, I am your friend. You understand? Friend. I want to help him. ,Classic
50520, See? ,Classic

140879, What was that? ,Classic
140664, You see what I mean? A trap.,Classic

149101, Is he often like this? ,Classic

151904, You had no choice. Come on. ,Classic
151730, I assume this is the only way. ,Classic
19880," I care not who you are. Seize him! It is enough that you have trifled with my credulity and made me look a fool in front of all my captains. Now, finish the business and be brief. And do not bring their bodies back. Let them rot here, so that they can be an example to their fellows. ",Classic
100449, All right. ,Classic
149558," Okay, you got it.   Now hurry. Okay, you two. Let's get going. And don't try anything, either of you. ",Classic
51233, Yes. By Toba. Prepare this ship for take off! ,Classic

36524, Hello? Who's there?,Classic
18127," But you brought up the subject. Now don't argue, please. Don't argue. I've never heard such rubbish. ",Classic
54226," Oh, sure. ",Classic
78175," How about a sandwich? Only marmalade, I'm afraid. ",Classic
62824," Brigadier! You'll be careful, won't you? After all, you don't really know what you're following, you know. ",Classic
88262," Yes, well, that's another thing that concerns me, this war. I thought the Federation was dedicated to peace? ",Classic
121364, What's the meaning of this? Why aren't we going down to Azure?,Classic
35686, What? ,Classic
59307, The Butcher.,Classic

70849, Wait outside. I will bring you food. ,Classic
109669, Which way did he go? ,Classic
50597," I see. Frightened I might disappear, eh? ",Classic
15216," They will, Sita, when they hear our story. ",Classic
119334," My dear, you must be a genius. ",Classic
98553," Mmm. So, you say you just found this pod lying there empty. ",Classic
143533," Back to the stairs, quick. ",Classic
29127, He's bleeding! ,Classic
58239," Nice smooth landing, after all. ",Classic
25576," Well, you can walk if you like, but I shouldn't if I were you. ",Classic
71047," Yes. Yes, exactly like this. ",Classic
17901, And very nice too. ,Classic
45499, Hope not. Come on. ,Classic
30541," Age, name and occupation. ",Classic
86284," No good, sir. ",Classic
59649," Yes? Yes, he's just gone. Oh. All right.   What on earth are you doing? ",Classic
82664, You were lucky they didn't find you. ,Classic
121131, Oh dear. ,Classic
110601, What? ,Classic
23401, Don't let me detain you.,Classic
157085, You imbecile. You've signed their death warrants. ,Classic
39677, We will work together on the Dalek factor. Follow me. ,Classic
56712, I might ask you the same question. ,Classic
86047," Seize him!   No. The sword is too quick and clean a death for you. Well, since you are a wizard, then by wizardry shall you die. ",Classic
32358, I didn't realise they'd have a circuit of their own. ,Classic
153179," If the accused hadn't interrupted, my lady, the point I wish to make would have become obvious. ",Classic
154420, He looks like a younger me. ,Classic
89262," It seems we had no choice, Commander. ",Classic
15678, You two come with me. I'll get to the bottom of this.,Classic
107775," Ready, master. ",Classic
38433, What does that mean? ,Classic
141841," I'm sorry, Maddox, but your usefulness is at an end.   Leave him! He's dead.   If any of you try to follow me, she dies. ",Classic
21014, Then your accusation is preposterous. ,Classic
38328, The police box? ,Classic
23610, Your Majesty ,Classic
30738, This little baby's gonna solve all our problems. ,Classic
103377," V14, stop all motive units. ",Classic
149520," As a matter of fact, he is. A tree has four times the life expectancy of a human being. ",Classic
49333, There's only one solution. That rocket was re-fuelled in space. Provided with at least with another twelve fuel rods. ,Classic
116633," No, no, look. ",Classic
39891, Of course. No one questions your leadership. ,Classic
55996, Report Moonbase situation please. ,Classic
23501, What are you talking about? ,Classic
36881, Who is it? ,Classic
68668,   This unworthy person welcomes you and delights in your safe arrival. ,Classic
92648, From where? ,Classic
107133," Ain't a word of truth in it, that's why. ",Classic
60482, It's all right. You're quite safe. ,Classic
202, Yes. ,Classic
93184,   ADalek. Very primitive but undeniably a Dalek. ,Classic
41156," It's not your abominable snowman either, Travers. Look.   It's metal. ",Classic
75301, I was defending myself. This man came here to kill me. ,Classic
1120, Come over here. ,Classic
24354, Yes! ,Classic
43985, You are too kind. Now will you listen to me? ,Classic
132809, How much further?   What caused that? ,Classic
68110, I'm afraid I cut your connection. ,Classic
102726, You feel ,Classic
48149," No, what is the weed going to do? ",Classic
87967, Non-conductive shielding burnt out. Sensors register receiving seven thousand volt electrical charge. ,Classic
145317, And we are to address you as sir? ,Classic
101776," It's no use, Doctor. ",Classic
94558, Yes. ,Classic
115624, In the dungeons! ,Classic
160398," Well, yes and no. This isn't a prison, but cross that line and you're a dead man. ",Classic
91358," Maybe he won't, but I will. Move away! ",Classic
14031, Water? ,Classic
20809," You must rest. The tablets I gave you have made you better, but you must still rest. ",Classic
71465," And once we've been classified as outlaws, what then? ",Classic
165323," Black wins, Time Lord. ",Classic
32955," Oh, enjoy yourselves. So you are for the Prince after all? ",Classic
92697, He's still lying. ,Classic
29025," You don't sound very certain, Doctor. ",Classic
69538," Thunderbolt is equipped with an abort mechanism. Once in go condition, it can be blown up at any time. ",Classic
49123, And this is the Operations and Communications room. ,Classic
92638," Shut up! By the time we caught up with him, he was bent over Zake.   He killed him. ",Classic
33072, What? ,Classic
117245, It's a two-way mirror. ,Classic
107924," I'll get him up. Come on, don't be frightened. ",Classic
13980, I have made a study of the Zarbi. I think I could make use of him. ,Classic
138086, Maybe. ,Classic
18620," Oh, you could be the same as them, using us for your own salvation. ",Classic
134660, The power diverted to defend itself. ,Classic
94062," Yes. One, it scratches metal. Two, it attacks its victims so suddenly that they become unconscious before they can even raise the alarm, and three. ",Classic
85471, He's gone! ,Classic
53951," Hold it there. Now, Gregory, connect the Professor's machine. ",Classic
82570, I do not understand. ,Classic
85734, Sorry. I do wish I'd brought my glasses. ,Classic
157835, The Doctor really is ice hot. ,Classic
6635," Oh, dear, what a pity. ",Classic
3714, He's got another key. I saw him go inside. ,Classic
33274, Get down! Get down! ,Classic
104525, Your cab's here. ,Classic
34102," Yes. But it's cheap and plentiful. We pick up survivors from shipwrecks who would otherwise be corpses, and convert them to fish people. ",Classic
929, That there was someone out there and they touched you on the shoulder? ,Classic
7972," I will, sir. ",Classic
152416," Oh, I love you. ",Classic
63014," Any luck, Captain? ",Classic
21676, I mean your plan. ,Classic
150011," I can't tell you how privileged I feel, having been half-frozen, and asphyxiated, and cooked, and then forced to clamber through miles of pipe. ",Classic
73218," I did, because of what happened yesterday. ",Classic
108731," Oh, delighted, delighted.   Hmm. Company solidly based. You've a widely diversified operational field. Yes. ",Classic
14389, As to the sending of a messenger? Joanna. ,Classic
59413," Now look, I'm not being confined anywhere. ",Classic
66145, Very well. ,Classic
11295, Shh. ,Classic
28050, Never. ,Classic
29325, And maybe find out who really killed the Churchwarden. ,Classic
158541," They're here! Ray, everyone else stay here until its safe to come out. Goronwy, have you got the beeswax? Thank you. Delta and your daughter, come with me. Barricade the door. ",Classic
61980, Not so fast. I have a lot of questions to ask you. ,Classic
136893, I don't know. Perhaps we'll find that out too. ,Classic
109632, No. They'll come and dig us out. ,Classic
32194," To create static, the Daleks need a complete cable circuit. ",Classic
142926, I've only just put them up. ,Classic
154154, Doctor. ,Classic
149451, Later. Where's Stephenson? ,Classic
141136," We've reached the Tower. We're all safe. The barriers are down and the Tardis is here. And I say, we've made the most extraordinary discovery. ",Classic
103039, But we don't.   Do we. ,Classic
44523, Why I haven't tried to expose Salamander? ,Classic
91105," You might find that difficult, Brigadier, but I won't stand on formalities. Search, by all means, if you wish. ",Classic
73390, You have said and done enough. The time has come for your execution. ,Classic
23141, You're too suspicious. Steven's been travelling abroad. He knows nothing about what's been happening here. Do you? ,Classic
139798," I would point out that under our agreement, it is mine. Unless, of course, you wish to surrender something else in its place. The Doctor is in your debt for his life. Give me the Doctor, and you can have this, the Tardis, whatever you wish. ",Classic
91761, No doubt about it. ,Classic
35812," Yes, of course. ",Classic
87579," No, I heard it, up in the haze. Over to the north a little bit. ",Classic
62858," Don't worry, my dear. We're all under a bit of a strain at the moment. ",Classic
131024," Yes, of course. The other man standing there laughing. Go on. ",Classic
16721, Good. Where? Ah. ,Classic
120074, He's quite right. ,Classic
128364," Tegan, I told you to get out of here. ",Classic
14073," No, Hlynia!",Classic
35879," What happened, Ola? ",Classic
78361, So vast a space inside so small a box. ,Classic
21315, Kingdom. ,Classic
137532," Brigadier, where is it? ",Classic
17360, Here.,Classic
86423, You can ask but I don't guarantee that you'll get a reply. ,Classic
147097, Please take me. They'll kill me if I stay here. ,Classic
38765," Just seeing to the young gentleman, miss. ",Classic
144442, It's all right. I only came out to say hello and goodbye. ,Classic
75887," Well, hurry up and fire those torpedoes, or we'll be drawn back into the cave. ",Classic
103010," Well, this is a two year tour. Maybe Chub was just beginning to get on somebody's nerves. ",Classic
92593," No, I ",Classic
135254, Where are we? ,Classic
19567," Yes, that's a good idea. ",Classic
8301," There's no doubt about it, Doctor. The inside filament's been removed. These weapons are useless. ",Classic
22559," You mean my performance was that good? I knew I had to fool the Daleks, but I thought you would see through it. ",Classic
124701, The Doctor. ,Classic
107614, Shush. You know what to do. ,Classic
74914," What, again? ",Classic
121500, I don't know. ,Classic
84546," Right, sir. ",Classic
144012," Without the threat of death, you're quite powerless, aren't you. ",Classic
146088," Very well, if you insist. ",Classic
142073," I've isolated the ignition circuit, Doctor. Can you identify it? Nod if you can.   Concentrate, Doctor. I will now feed in the charge. To burn out the circuit, concentrate and direct it. ",Classic
137011, But murder. I'm not sure I could go that far. ,Classic
64906, But you might.,Classic
18421," But they. Look, who is talking? Is it, is it this Chumbley, or is it someone else? ",Classic
63982, No! They will all stay here to die from the radiation. ,Classic
112703, Shush. ,Classic
65418, Why else should they invade the galaxy? They were on Mars before we were. ,Classic
135541," I guessed. Besides, I hoped it would give me the chance to meet you. ",Classic
161155," Yeah. So who were they, anyway? Who'd want to kill us? ",Classic
61692, What are you doing? ,Classic
122581," Very well. Leave the guards to watch that, and bring this machine to my to my laboratory and have it guarded. ",Classic
149808, I don't know which is yourself. ,Classic
130120, What are we doing? ,Classic
75728," And, er, who are you? ",Classic
29070," Here, I've seen a few shady customers in my time, but this crowd beats the lot. ",Classic
148478, Who are you? ,Classic
147281," I don't want to put the wind up you, but I think we're being followed. ",Classic
126891," All-pervading evil, and somehow nurtured in those three good people standing before me to receive the blessing of the Keeper. Doctor, my time is close. I need your help. ",Classic
152385," Not doing very well, are you. ",Classic
34187, Show me. ,Classic
5981," Of course.  In spite of the drought, there's plenty of water for the flowers. ",Classic
40376, You sure that's the one? ,Classic
10627," Well, Doctor, where are we now, then. ",Classic
112577," What, just like that? Because of lights in the sky? ",Classic
155082," Why not? Indeed, the idea makes good sense. ",Classic
28244," She's gone? Gone where, child? ",Classic
32816, There's a high track. ,Classic
160823, Move it. ,Classic
36087," Patrol two, over here, Patrol three, follow me. If you see him, shoot to kill. I'll have a look over there. ",Classic
130085, How can I re-circuit Bigon without Monarch knowing? ,Classic
18725," We apologise for the glass partition, but you will understand we must keep our atmosphere in here. ",Classic
3753, That's a very good idea. Good. ,Classic
1604," But even if he does get out, he's stuck down there. His only way out is the lift. We must go back for him! ",Classic
161279, Doctor! ,Classic
38867, Very complex. And you want to introduce this human factor into the race of Daleks? ,Classic
106998, Hmm? ,Classic
45597, We're up to something? Now just a moment. Suppose you tell us first just what's going on down here. ,Classic
132457, Come on. Some brandy will help calm you down. ,Classic
50180," Ready, Leo. ",Classic
10734, What's this? A whip. Why. ,Classic
35521, What does that mean? ,Classic
5143," No, the nearest village is three miles away. I stay out here to look after my traps. ",Classic
116170, I'd rather not die at all. ,Classic
59897, Yes. You did something with thee gun. ,Classic
43256, The Doctor. You heard what he said. ,Classic
121158, Medics level four. Meet you at the elevator. Move! ,Classic
2649," I see. Divide and conquer, eh? She's trying to poison your mind against me. ",Classic
62667, I'd like to include some of these supplementary tests. ,Classic
43403, Frequency three five. ,Classic
150853," Of all the conceited ingrates! Do you know, he almost succeeded in concealing my natural charm. ",Classic
93662," No, I covered a fairly large area and found no one. No one living, that is. ",Classic
77056, What are they counting? ,Classic
29500," Cease these vile untruths, boy! These gentlemen are goodly merchants. I vouch for them. You are a stranger here, as is your companion, and therefore not to be trusted. ",Classic
125895, It's like a kind of dream. Someone was whispering to me about power and eternal life.   They're going to initiate me at some big ceremony tonight. ,Classic
143320," Better for morale if we keep on the move, eh? We can take it slowly. Quiet. There's someone coming.   Turlough. ",Classic
65650," No, we don't want a panic. ",Classic
58389," I want permission to return to base. Caven, do you hear me? I'm bringing this ship in. ",Classic
159536," A landing pattern for some kind of spacecraft, isn't it? ",Classic
25581, Yes.,Classic
106220, Hide. ,Classic
738, No. He is our leader. ,Classic
100958, Yes? ,Classic
43070," Well, I'll talk to them. Someone has to. ",Classic
88042, The floor! ,Classic
10145," It's all right. This way, quickly. ",Classic
42299," Well, you're lucky. There's one down there who's staying on the mountain for good. ",Classic
111076, I didn't. How do you know? ,Classic
98262," Doctor! Doctor! Doctor, please get up. Please.   No, no. ",Classic
21475, Inform me as soon as you know that your mechanism has reached Mira. ,Classic
127389, What plans in particular? ,Classic
59052," LIZ seventy nine, this is General Hermack. ",Classic
99807," I don't know. His skin, such a strange colour. ",Classic
110240," Oh, one must, one must, yes. ",Classic
122415, Yes. ,Classic
71480, This is Captain Dent. Shall I come to your ship? ,Classic
131577, With a trick like that you could make a fortune around the fairgrounds. ,Classic
41483," No, I would not. ",Classic
40940," Jamie, the roof. What are you doing? ",Classic
23988," Well, my dear, I'm a doctor of science, and this machine is for travelling through time and relative dimensions in space. Now you ",Classic
131209, But what? ,Classic
73283," Well, I can't get this thing to work, either. But this is a form of time machine, of a very crude kind. ",Classic
28430, She can go down to my house in the country. My wife will look after her. ,Classic
157981," No, no. ",Classic
88615, It's not like that on Peladon. The ruler is always a man. I was only crowned because my father had no son. It's Ortron who holds the real power. ,Classic
46804, Where's the Doctor? Evans! ,Classic
3575," Marco, quick. Look! ",Classic
65327, Cornish. He's gone. ,Classic
133500, To your positions. Take cover. ,Classic
100267, Giuliano sent you these to choose from. ,Classic
129720, I'll do my best. ,Classic
145236, Surrender. ,Classic
20791, We agreed to send a delegate in order that the conference should not become suspicious. ,Classic
146738, Don't waste your breath. We'll manage. ,Classic
42584, If you call for help. ,Classic
148321, No. ,Classic
117981, What? You mean there's a way in he doesn't know about? ,Classic
27026, What was it? ,Classic
128250," There will be no future. You are eroding structure, generating entropy. ",Classic
70128, The Brigadier is under arrest. ,Classic
64206," Oh, that's good. ",Classic
9624," We took it for granted you belonged to the other side, the aristocracy. ",Classic
34716, Will you listen to that. ,Classic
23218, We didn't speak of him. ,Classic
110849, Where is level three? ,Classic
146628, Anywhere. ,Classic
146625, That's the seediest looking stately home I've ever seen. ,Classic
108732," You're a fool, Doctor. I shall have you steamed for your interference. ",Classic
124285, Screens? What screens? ,Classic
155022," I am fully conversant with the navigational code, Mister Edwardes. I thought you were reporting to the medic. ",Classic
85695, I'm Commander Linx - Fifth Sontaran Army Space Fleet. ,Classic
27666," All right, we'll make use of that. How close in do I have to go before this becomes effective? ",Classic
6435, Why not? ,Classic
77448, What's that? ,Classic
99117," True, but they don't know that, do they. ",Classic
124209, What do we do now? ,Classic
150869, Oh. Where would the First Lady suggest? ,Classic
118728," Tell me, Doctor, when did you first realise we were robotic? ",Classic
112223, No other entity is present. ,Classic
101452," We are simply seekers of the truth, and we haven't got much time. Chancellor Goth has ordered your immediate trial. ",Classic
35255," No, we're on the moon. You know, the moon, up in the sky. ",Classic
95404, Perhaps. ,Classic
155569," No, thank you. ",Classic
16992, Totally immobilised. ,Classic
35944, This the life. ,Classic
29316," Sir, am I safe now? ",Classic
81389, Open the hatch to your airlock or we shall enter your ship by force. ,Classic
64355, Perhaps because we're feeding it nonsense. Maybe that sound from the capsule was just freak static. ,Classic
100085, I shall not lie against the Duke. You can kill me first. ,Classic
63905, We shall force you to reactivate it. We shall take the centre!,Classic
85749," This isn't a rescue, Doctor, it's a capture. Let's get him out of here. ",Classic
143696, Good. We must join them. ,Classic
26452," Ah, but Doc. ",Classic
135239, It's not without due and proper consideration that this decision has been made. ,Classic
107548, Beautiful? ,Classic
51376," If necessary. We control an entire galaxy. Our war mission is spreading to colonise others. Our Quarks must be released for this task, therefore we must replace their workforce on our home planets. ",Classic
88066," This is it. Five seconds, four, three, two, one. ",Classic
28409," It was if something enormous and terrific was trying to absorb me. Yes, yes, yes. Oh, it's ridiculous, child, isn't it? Yes, yes, yes, there's something erratically wrong with that telephone, yes. It was just like an electric shock. ",Classic
107127, It is just the same as before. ,Classic
56761, Return to where you were. ,Classic
21298, I'm afraid I may not be able to help it. ,Classic
60300," I don't know, but they're going to the landing bay. Come on. ",Classic
107305, What are you doing? ,Classic
51690, Proceed with lift off! ,Classic
143646, Relax. I'm going into the warehouse. ,Classic
133951," Oh, great. You make it sound like a shopping list, ticking off things as you go. Aren't you forgetting something rather important? Adric is dead. ",Classic
137793, The Time Lord has left us. ,Classic
155357, This gentleman's just given us the answer. ,Classic
104494, What were you saying when I came in? Something about a madman? ,Classic
99873," Yes, and what's it got to do with that cult of Demnos? ",Classic
76294," Land and sea alike, all grey. Grey cities linked by grey highways across grey deserts. ",Classic
155489," Well, that can't happen. ",Classic
115472, What? ,Classic
90689," I had to face my fear, Sarah. I had to face my fear. That was more important than just going on living. ",Classic
29957," Look, the Doctor wouldn't cheat no one. ",Classic
158615, Where is it? ,Classic
102324, The litany says it can be destroyed. ,Classic
134264, Tardis. Tardis. Tardis. ,Classic
119540, Go. Go! ,Classic
114507, Shush. All the Megara will have is a name on the charge sheet. ,Classic
165712, What? ,Classic
39479, You mean just walk into the city? ,Classic
157184, We don't want you to be a Kang. Not a Red Kang.,Classic
31660, Lesterson. ,Classic
115437, I am? ,Classic
119304," Have you tried this?   That's a more interesting effect, don't you think? Did you know when you built that it could do something like that? ",Classic
38713, Static? ,Classic
130624, Yes? ,Classic
52884, International Electromatics? ,Classic
127187," Now, we put it down about, yes, here. Hmm. ",Classic
114683," Cessair of Diplos, you have been tried and found guilty of the following charges. Impersonating a religious personage, to wit, a Celtic goddess, for which the penalty is imprisonment for one thousand five hundred years. Theft of the Great Seal of Diplos, for which the penalty is perpetual imprisonment. The sentences to run consecutively. Have you anything to say before sentence is passed? ",Classic
39321, Anyone would think this was a little game. ,Classic
39397," Well, go along, man! Go along and see. Find your Victoria.   Stupid, stupid girl. ",Classic
25432," Dodo, ignore them! This is all being done to prevent us from finding the key. They don't really exist, remember? It's not real. ",Classic
128098, Transfer instability. It may be only temporary. ,Classic
8608," Well, we'd better join the others.",Classic
125274, Sounds as if it's come and gone. ,Classic
100902, Hi. ,Classic
662," The old woman sleeps in the cave too, and she has gone. ",Classic
123888," Chronic hysteresis!   I hope not. If it is, we'll be stuck here forever. ",Classic
163971," Yes, and the real owner won't be pleased when it wakes up. ",Classic
28101," Well, it's my ship, see. It's gone off to the West Indies and I've got a shore posting. In barracks for six months. ",Classic
78088," The truth, Krasis? ",Classic
156167," Well, I never thought I'd welcome the sight of you. ",Classic
141758, Understood. ,Classic
20767," He won't find any on this planet, believe me, so why not try the tablets? I hate to see anyone die through stupidity. ",Classic
79377, Right. ,Classic
38014," But even if you get on that plane, what do you hope to do? ",Classic
18850," No sun, no clouds, merely a metal roof radiating some kind of light. ",Classic
132609," Sergeant, do we pass the station? ",Classic
45916," We've had it, boyo. We can't go forward, and we can't go back.   ",Classic
142063," No, no, there isn't time. ",Classic
4789," Barbara, these people are very kind to us. They've given us everything. ",Classic
152450, I think we need some more of these. ,Classic
132528," Well, it wouldn't be cricket. ",Classic
140295," Rather like the Tardis, really.   What are we going to do with him? ",Classic
39932," Now that we're all here. Now that we're all here, I think we'd better take stock of the situation. This appears to be a dead end. The only way out appears to be through that hatch. ",Classic
124662," Why not the Tardis, Adric? ",Classic
42194," But Doctor, look. ",Classic
13009," Yes, madame. ",Classic
126266, She doesn't mean that. We're traders. Do you know what a Tharil looks like? ,Classic
17346, A little. He said he was a traveller. ,Classic
20170," Oh, think, my dear Odysseus. A whole fleet of them carrying a company of soldiers over the walls and into Troy. ",Classic
105557," Shush. Don't tell them that, whatever you do. What do you mean, do not be afraid. ",Classic
76136, And or creature. ,Classic
1011," Oh, no, no need for that. This is easily repaired. All we have to do is refill it. ",Classic
43823, Surely there is someone you can take your story to? ,Classic
43513, But she doesn't know everything. I have the answers that you require. ,Classic
45592," The Doctor, is he? ",Classic
5447, Very well. ,Classic
163827, Did that hurt? Good. Now open door.,Classic
56790, Splendid! What is it? ,Classic
6245," No, but defeat would mean disgrace. No man could look upon me or speak to me for many days. ",Classic
88389, How unfortunate! What a catastrophe! Has she been harmed? ,Classic
53268," This place is like a maze. Doctor, I think we're lost. ",Classic
122490, Have you any idea where it came from? ,Classic
146100," My dear child, stop worrying. Try to understand. Regeneration in my case is a swift but volcanic experience. A kind of violent biological eruption in which the body cells are displaced, changed, renewed and rearranged.   There are bound to be side-effects. ",Classic
145983," She's dying, Doctor. She has Spectrox toxaemia. ",Classic
97571, A pity you had to find out.   We didn't want any shooting until our takeover was complete. ,Classic
117844, Nothing. ,Classic
6200," If I can give it, I shall. ",Classic
14736, Nothing? ,Classic
78704, Strangers are uncommon in our land. Who are you? ,Classic
90199," Oh, Sarah'll be all right for the moment. ",Classic
119258," Well, this room runs alongside the stairs, and it's only two point seven three metres in length. ",Classic
165186, Over there. You said something. ,Classic
32536," He's nuts, trying to talk to the Daleks.   Lesterson, what's in that cupboard? ",Classic
13167, I'll show you what I'm going to do! ,Classic
17868," I'm going to find out. Come along, my child, and bring my stick.",Classic
156095, What's he talking about? ,Classic
162870, Who was he? ,Classic
148756, And deprive Varos of an example of how traitors are dealt with? The cameras are still functioning. Let the show begin. I want to hear them scream till I am deaf with pleasure. To see their limbs twist in excruciating agony. Ultimately their blood must gush and flow along the gutters of Varos. The whole planet must delight in their torture and death. ,Classic
51656, Command accepted. ,Classic
144699," Citizens, listen to me. You're here to see the Outsider. You won't be disappointed, because we've found him. In fact, we found two of them. Doctor? Turlough?   Look at them. But they're not who you think they are. They're not messengers of Logar, but men like us. They will tell you that Logar is dead. Logar never existed. ",Classic
36814, The Pilot is a traitor. ,Classic
57288," Well, he drew the warrior off so that I could let you in. ",Classic
17943, Quickly! Quickly! ,Classic
65533," Well, keep trying.   Sir, we've been trying to reach you. ",Classic
92429," And we control the cryogenic chamber. I repeat, what do you want? ",Classic
154226, Yes. ,Classic
18225," No, it's all very odd, isn't it? Yes, it's very odd. ",Classic
155798," Don't prevaricate, Professor. ",Classic
142658, How? ,Classic
149995," You only say that, Chessene, because of the foreign, alien filth injected into you by Dastari. But come what may, you are an Androgum. Never lose sights of your horizons.",Classic
126633, They're slavers. ,Classic
36341, Have I? I don't remember. ,Classic
145913, What was that? ,Classic
37728," Might I have a word with you, my dear? ",Classic
91118," No, of course not, and they know I didn't. And I know that they know that I didn't, and they know that I know that ",Classic
22069," Nonsense! You put some more clothes on, child. Go along. And what's all this? ",Classic
76836," It's us, Doctor. Stubbs and Cotton. Is Miss Grant with you? ",Classic
152819," And meet the robot head on at full power? I don't think you have my full interests at heart, Dibber. ",Classic
44988," Yeah, perhaps you're right. Bruce listens to us at last. He's even prepared to ask questions, that's fine, but I know Salamander. He'd talk his way out of a quicksand. ",Classic
34619, They've gone to Zaroff's laboratory. ,Classic
57935, Sir? ,Classic
52728, Cancel D'Artagnan. Substitute Sir Lancelot in full armour.,Classic
67106, I thought you were supposed to soften him up? ,Classic
95480," Well, he was checked into the building. What's behind the conference hall? ",Classic
137174," Doctor, wait. ",Classic
52025," I leave you to your prudence what measures you will take. And now sir, to avoid suspicion, I must retire in as private a manner I came. ",Classic
162765," Interesting, isn't it? ",Classic
104680, Not a sound. Now quiet. Shush. ,Classic
155504, Yes? What is it? ,Classic
48666, Mister Robson. ,Classic
156720," With you, mistress. ",Classic
43453," And it's supposed to come up with all the answers, isn't it? Well, a fat lot of good it's doing us now. Wait, it says, wait! With glaciers on the one hand, and warriors on the other! Well, what price your computer now. ",Classic
111988," Yes, terrified. ",Classic
98334," Then let me, High One. Give the order and let me lead the Sisterhood. ",Classic
56540," I know, I know. I'm trying to re-activate it. ",Classic
85091," Doctor, get down!",Classic
2302, The last stage of the operation is about to begin. ,Classic
101766, Wanted power. Wanted to be President. ,Classic
64302," No, no, no. No, that was simply transmigration of object. There's a great deal of difference between that and pure science, you know. Now then, what about decoding this tape? Let me see now. ",Classic
149124, I can't see no point in burying a box. Better I bury him. ,Classic
155091," Now, before you go rushing off, Mel, do you know what a Judas goat is? ",Classic
110275, Yes? ,Classic
47989," Oh, well ",Classic
117442," And then Merak said he found this. It's Astra's. The strange thing is, it gives off a very faint signal on the tracer. It's obviously not the sixth segment, so what is it? ",Classic
130737, Look. ,Classic
97674," Well, I think you should take a look. Coming? ",Classic
2321, All Daleks to level ten immediately. Corridor intersections on all levels other than ten will be sealed now. ,Classic
96615, As simple as that? ,Classic
163206, Over. ,Classic
78700," You have said nothing to me yet. When you find the true words to speak, I will listen.",Classic
46637," Then there's no time to lose, is there? Oh, come on, Anne, don't give up. I need your help. ",Classic
20697, Perhaps they took him prisoner. ,Classic
2755, I've been racking my brains. I don't know. ,Classic
47235," Mister Robson, I think we should turn off the gas flow coming from the rigs and make a check. ",Classic
9955," Yes, I suppose so. It could be. What a strange rock formation. ",Classic
153441," Though manufacturing requires advanced technology, Humker. ",Classic
48118, With what objective? ,Classic
62542," Oh, yes. Oh, yes. The cyclotron uses power in enormous quantities. Would you care to step down?",Classic
153627," Lay aside your useless toys. I asked, why have you entered here? ",Classic
26665," Well, maybe you won't have to. But I mean with just Bat an' me an' Warren against the Clantons, you could sure shorten the odds some. ",Classic
82927, State reasons. ,Classic
34077, Nothing here. ,Classic
8922, Yes. It looks as if they've had soon trouble with the horse. ,Classic
16834," Look, it would be sheer suicide. ",Classic
139236, And the crew? ,Classic
159080, Ant hunts? ,Classic
82563," No, we'll need you to convince the Emperor, your Royal Highness. ",Classic
136771, Is that why you propose to assassinate me? ,Classic
120561, Adrasta's evil eye is on me. ,Classic
10274," That's sensible, practical. ",Classic
84894, Hold it. They're coming. ,Classic
156725," Computers are my speciality, not nuclear physics. ",Classic
49358, And you say that it eat metal? ,Classic
154123," The pressure gets worse each time. Something must be done, or soon you will be called Magnificence. ",Classic
129398, How can Earthlings have penetrated us? ,Classic
64223," That machine will give you surface maps of every surveyed planet, but a map of London? No. ",Classic
97889, The Sacred Flame dies. ,Classic
47690, And none of us will know now you've let them loose. ,Classic
51270," And if they have, they should be all right, shouldn't they? ",Classic
115383," Caution, master. ",Classic
92721," Hey, look! It�s Roth. ",Classic
128132, But you had a computer out there. You were using it. ,Classic
89156," Well, what's that thing, then? ",Classic
23672," Come in, Steven! ",Classic
113827, The Goddess? What goddess is that? ,Classic
38839, She's a prisoner of the Daleks.,Classic
145113, Does Turlough know how to fly the Tardis? ,Classic
68019," Well, the Doctor seems to think it might have killed him. ",Classic
59905, Excellent. The War Lord is pleased with our work. But the rate of progress must be accelerated. ,Classic
39311, I'm positive. Now we'll take care of her. You must leave immediately. ,Classic
954," Thank you. Oh, it's very nice. ",Classic
44994," Well, just a few minutes. I've got a pass. It's just a matter of getting there. ",Classic
60598, Thirty seconds.   ,Classic
49587, Well ,Classic
9381, My dear Barbara! ,Classic
99268, Doctor! ,Classic
95279, Your Grace. ,Classic
154059, Who indeed. Someone's coming. ,Classic
33522, I don't follow. ,Classic
154695," Well, certainly enough not to want to see her experimented upon. ",Classic
4911, There could be animals in this jungle around us. ,Classic
104724," At the House of the Dragon, Doctor. ",Classic
61348," Doctor, can I come back there with you? I'd rather like to try and find Lady Jennifer. ",Classic
127883, Ah. ,Classic
25371," Honestly, Steven. If they're not real, how can you lose your temper with them? You can't have it both ways, you know. ",Classic
27549, Don't talk. ,Classic
18369," Look, you go with them, quickly, but don't cause any trouble. It'll give me time to see if I can help you. I think perhaps I can do something to that machine, but I must have time, yes? ",Classic
15981," The child's just like me, you know. Always wants to know what's on t'other side of the hill. ",Classic
100071, Scarlatti is enjoying his work? ,Classic
148582, Mine feel strange too. My skin. Oh no! ,Classic
161674, You study history? ,Classic
75302," Be so good as to explain yourself, Doctor. ",Classic
75556," Trenchard, you really must be more calm. Believe me, it's very simple. ",Classic
6408," A thorn, some poison, and the aged servant of Yetaxa. ",Classic
88606, Tell him to come to the Citadel and meet with me in secret. I would hear the grievances of his people and do my best to remedy them. ,Classic
21622, Where are the others? ,Classic
97650," It must, Condo. One day, a true humanoid species, warm blooded, with a central nervous system. One such specimen, just one, and I can complete my work here. ",Classic
76498, I'll send some medics down to pick him up.,Classic
134947," Ah, but such a restricted range. ",Classic
84972," Good. Now then, we must go to work. There is very little time left. Here are your instructions.",Classic
21162," Oh, don't ask questions, my dear girl, otherwise you'll become like the other two. Just do as you're told.   Now then. That should repel any boarders. ",Classic
10760, Dortmun's on the rampage. And who have we got here? ,Classic
43886, Holding me? ,Classic
103251, Tell the Commander what? ,Classic
152648," Now, listen to me. ",Classic
39855, This is an archaeological expedition. We're searching the universe for the last remains of the Cybermen. ,Classic
132029," Oh, yes. ",Classic
140988," No, Doctor! ",Classic
16667, Operate ramp control. Activate robot power source.   Your orders are understood? You will infiltrate and kill. ,Classic
127067," No, Tremas. I'm doing this for you. ",Classic
79558," Yes, we are. ",Classic
138980, Who can tell? ,Classic
63366, If you go down there with a party of armed men there's bound to be fighting. ,Classic
64815, I have got to get back. ,Classic
81031," The tribunal is not deliberating. The tribunal is arguing. And quite nonsensically, if I may say so. ",Classic
52853," Hey, you be careful of that thing. It cost me a fortune. ",Classic
86022,"   I am a gift to Captain Irongron from the one who made me, my master, Commander Linx. ",Classic
4043," By boat. We can't go by boat, Marco, we need the Tardis. ",Classic
63473, But ,Classic
157307, And that means? ,Classic
92138, You have an alternative plan? ,Classic
138716, Terminus will never move again. ,Classic
35853," Right, come on boys. ",Classic
17341, You've seen him? ,Classic
90012," The people need Arak. They trust him, they listen to him. He's our last chance. ",Classic
165302, Only he can return me to the future. ,Classic
133705, We're coming back to the Tardis. The hold is crawling with robots. ,Classic
57163, Well I don't know. If it were given top priority.,Classic
19985, Vicki? That's a very outlandish name. ,Classic
72887," There, that'll teach you. Daughter of light, would you kindly untie my bonds? ",Classic
1676, I'll be there. ,Classic
80988, You've not lost it?,Classic
4863, They're coming with us? ,Classic
142089," Fun?   Sir George, you must stop these war games. ",Classic
60519,"   They are in here, trapped.   Right, in!",Classic
85975," You wish for my answer, Doctor? ",Classic
589, Let me look at him. ,Classic
18499," It is by the Drahvin spaceship. It reports that a being, not Drahvin, came out of it. ",Classic
96189," Duplicates of Sorenson. Pure antimatter. The neutron accelerator boosted its power, and the creatures split off and multiplied. ",Classic
136559," The lock is extremely primitive. It's practically a museum piece. There's no electronic impulse matrix to decode, no sonic microcircuit to disrupt. Crude mechanical six barrel movement, key operated. Primitive but adequate. Well, it's more than adequate, actually, because the key is what we don't have. ",Classic
13222, Oh. ,Classic
60778," Well, you must hold on as long as you can. I think I've got the answer. You see, we have to have a safe base from which to fight these people. I must go and get on with my work. ",Classic
164745," Oh, shut up, Crane. ",Classic
5242," It's not your fault. Don't worry, we'll just go back the way we came. Come on. ",Classic
67912, Just a proving flight. ,Classic
101895, What's that? ,Classic
43354, Come on then. ,Classic
8048," Then we shall have to give up. We must leave the city, hide in the mountains. ",Classic
75388, Naturally. ,Classic
43249, You have some kind of communicator. ,Classic
51738," Oh no!   Oh! This darn thing's stuck! Of all the stupid, idiotic! ",Classic
15434, We've just lost the Doctor. Has that already changed the future?,Classic
150820," Jamie? Jamie, can you hear me?   Jamie, wake up. ",Classic
70761," Well, if there really is a chance. ",Classic
62658," He's very conscientious, isn't he? ",Classic
16934, Attack! Attack! Attack! Attack! Attack! Attack! Attack! ,Classic
139253, To Miss Tegan's cabin. ,Classic
11586, Better. I don't think I'll be able to walk. ,Classic
76458, Then I shall want to know what's in it before he does. ,Classic
138686," It's crude stuff, probably organic. ",Classic
25828," Oh, it's not supposed to be. That's for you. ",Classic
36044," Accident. Stand by, oxygen supply. ",Classic
143003, Good. See you later. ,Classic
126222," Hmm. Well, I must say I'm quite looking forward to going there with you and the Doctor. ",Classic
111126, D�j� vu. It's a common thing among time travellers. ,Classic
95146," The signal's coming from inland, sir. Bearing two three zero. ",Classic
157877, Did Mel make the creature unalive for you? ,Classic
29615, Such subtle ways gladden my soul. ,Classic
61199, Stop! Wind further on. Now! Try there. ,Classic
10545, DN6. It's DN6. ,Classic
1118, Can't you stand up? ,Classic
30843," Yes, I'm sure. Right now you're coming with me. I need you. We'll talk about this after that rocket's gone. ",Classic
111633, Well? ,Classic
140265," Where I cannot win by stealth, I shall destroy. That way I cannot fail to win. ",Classic
25707," But if I do, this place vanishes. ",Classic
32434, Yes. ,Classic
159136, Back to the Tardis. ,Classic
74048," Look, Benton, keep them back as long as you can. ",Classic
65415, They told me that their intentions were peaceful. That these three beings here were ambassadors. ,Classic
138730, Why does he never listen? ,Classic
137924, You mean zap? ,Classic
74146," As a member of the preliminary assessment commission, I have great hopes that your planet will be acceptable as a candidate for the Galactic Federation. ",Classic
13655, (Crater of Needles. ,Classic
90135, That I am. ,Classic
165248, Come on! We've got to get Kathleen's chess set.,Classic
53933," Aye, here. ",Classic
116538," Oh look, it's coming this way. ",Classic
75362, I was just wondering about Miss Grant and the Doctor. Shouldn't they be back by now?,Classic
121715, Right. Come back aboard as quick as you can. ,Classic
132886, An amazing species. ,Classic
163779," Now, sir. ",Classic
51443," All right, Cully? ",Classic
105810, Enough! ,Classic
51635," Doctor, help him. He's hurt. ",Classic
147548," I'm going, I'm going. ",Classic
154494," Hold your tongue. This way, unless you wish to die here. ",Classic
132718, Are you all palaeontologists? ,Classic
19685," And one of them lies here, in the camp of Agamemnon, our general. Oh, hear me out, I pray. For ten long years now we have laid siege to Troy and still they defy us. Come.",Classic
135200," Well, for a moment it did. What you saw was an attempted temporal bonding. The molecular realignment of two basically incompatible lifeforms. ",Classic
10725, 2164. ,Classic
50014, She's in the Oxygen room. ,Classic
22798, Then this must be a trap. ,Classic
97673, I've no idea. ,Classic
109646," Ten, nine ",Classic
2935," It is, my lady, and may I ask who you are?",Classic
70360, I'll have them cleared immediately. ,Classic
164936," Yes, quick!",Classic
47036," Good. Into the machine, Doctor. ",Classic
76895," Ha! I didn't know what to do. I couldn't let you die, so I carried you as quickly as I could out of the radioactive zone to where I hoped your friends would find you. ",Classic
92726," Good girl, Sarah. Who�s your fast friend? ",Classic
134216," What's happening?  (Bilton, Scobie, Angela and Culshaw freeze, then they are surrounded by man-sized creatures of opaque bubbles that move. A sudden fog moves in then vanishes and only Angela and Culshaw remain. They walk away. ",Classic
84023, Do you mind going down first? ,Classic
100387, Evacuate observation dome. Immediate. ,Classic
14008," You are of no further use except for the way you think. I need your intelligence. You will be brought to the centre, to me! ",Classic
21035," All right, Doctor. But now that we've got it what are we going to do with it? ",Classic
109689," Yes, come on, come on. ",Classic
78805, The guardian.,Classic
25122," Ah! Very good point, my dear. Yes, yes, we must find the throne. ",Classic
87144, The Doctor. I heard a message over the R/T to say he'd been caught. Wasn't at my HQ so I thought they must have brought him here. ,Classic
104346," Yes, and now he knows where I am, he will be back. ",Classic
134499," Doctor, you will give me the key of the Tardis. ",Classic
9015," Susan, wait a minute. ",Classic
162945," Carbury, where the action is. ",Classic
89597, I have come to give you the power you seek. ,Classic
161457, This is your tomb? ,Classic
67422," I'm a fully qualified agent, you know. Cryptology, safe breaking, explosives. ",Classic
62796, I'm afraid I can't see anything at all. ,Classic
78373, We'll make contact as soon as possible. ,Classic
132498, But our guests ,Classic
140643," That's my best enemy. He likes to be known as the Master, don't you? My, my, my, but you've changed. Another regeneration? ",Classic
67085, All right. You go and soften him up and I'll close in for the kill. ,Classic
50807, I can see I shall get no work from you two until you have got positive proof. Come along.,Classic
27114, Thirty eight ,Classic
28028," Well, Miss, er? ",Classic
77063," This is madness, Varan. ",Classic
9076," Some wine, citizen? ",Classic
39899," No, don't touch him! ",Classic
123207," Interfibral malfunction. A line's gone down. So many faults, accidents, the death this morning. ",Classic
150980," Oh, I'm past caring. I want some answers. ",Classic
18342," Shh!   Oh, Doctor, I thought they'd heard us. ",Classic
4584," Look at the joins in the blocks, Ian. ",Classic
124917, What difference does it make? Are they going to kill us? ,Classic
24362," Are you aware that you might be committing your entire community to a slow extinction? Trust me. Allow me, help me to find a new cure for this fever of yours. ",Classic
67669, A room ,Classic
72795," Mike, I'm scared. ",Classic
154387, May we continue? I do grow tired of these constant interruptions. ,Classic
89962, Barnes? He's gone. ,Classic
73560, The man who owned that machine is dead. His body is back in our time zone. ,Classic
59012, Right. Full boost. Let's get in closer and have a look.,Classic
125541, On level two? ,Classic
66546," Don't worry, I've never seen a bore I couldn't cap yet. ",Classic
18796, I've hurt my ankle. ,Classic
23815, What Monsieur? ,Classic
99749," My child, the purity of your sacrifice renders it doubly welcome to the mighty Demnos, god of the twin realms of moontide and solstice. ",Classic
41492," Oh, no, you mustn't do that. Jamie, no! ",Classic
159291, Perivale. ,Classic
623, The old woman won't give us away. She helped. ,Classic
101226, Thanks. ,Classic
30234, The old boy would like to have a word with you. Claims it's urgent. ,Classic
90137, Take that word back or I'll stuff it down your throat. ,Classic
59538," No, but isn't it strange that you should to be suffering from it too? ",Classic
98587, Another pod! ,Classic
164873, Ah. What are you going to do with her? ,Classic
37775," Now look here, Jean. ",Classic
124912, They have other matters on their minds. You'll have to have patience. ,Classic
10358," Yes, but if they fill that sink with any more water. ",Classic
92539," It's not only oscillating, it's ellipsing as well. You'd better give her a hand, Harry. ",Classic
97560," They've made replicas of you and Harry, Colonel. ",Classic
124663, It's too small. ,Classic
64720," Well, I suspect some sort of pattern. ",Classic
83089," You go on, I'll be all right. ",Classic
15650, That's nearly the lot. ,Classic
87112, He's turned off. He's heading for the Common. Over. ,Classic
138327, Shut the door. ,Classic
53604," Yes, sir and two of the outer perimeter guard posts reported seeing strangers in the area outside, sir. ",Classic
6806, They're all busy at the ceremony and this is just the right time. ,Classic
128277, I wouldn't take orders from you if you were the last man in the universe. ,Classic
81353, What?,Classic
51670," Well, it's sealed. It's completely sealed! I can't possibly undo it! ",Classic
144502, Heretic. Unbeliever. ,Classic
134794," Zarak, that's just a dream. The Master will use the power for his own evil purposes. He'll never allow you to regenerate. ",Classic
47983," There's isn't a great deal we can do at the moment, I'm afraid. Oak, as soon as they signal, bring them up. And if there's any sign of trouble, come and get me. ",Classic
68221, We should try and leave. ,Classic
83551, Alarm! I cannot see! Vision impaired! ,Classic
138521," What, then? ",Classic
117635, I think we should move. ,Classic
145168, The tide's out. ,Classic
59139," Hold on, Dom. You'll be all right. Look, in a minute or two, we're going to land on Ta. You'll see little Maddie again, Dom. ",Classic
2858," Barbara, I wonder, do you think it could be the Earth? If it were, where do you think we could be? In the Alps?",Classic
34458, Yes. ,Classic
113994," Leonard, I'm not going to leave you. ",Classic
90910, Who are you? Why are you here?   ,Classic
80139," Now, now, Shirna, don't be so. The scope! Come on. Come on, give me a hand.   Careful now. Please be careful.   Now have a care with that, please? It cost a lot of credit bars. ",Classic
44616," He's through, Sergeant. Smash that lock.",Classic
74940," Well, them over at the naval base. The secret research establishment. ",Classic
18372,.,Classic
140919," I'm not looking, I'm not looking. ",Classic
116846," Yes, it's well guarded, or at least it was. Perhaps the door's booby-trapped. ",Classic
11791, I don't think they will be coming back. They activated one of their bombs. They intend to blow a hole through the centre of the Earth. ,Classic
124883, Yes. ,Classic
108502, You couldn't do it. ,Classic
95152," The target reciprocator is dead, Commander. ",Classic
26739," Then we'll come a-lookin'.   Your friend there, whose side's he on? ",Classic
38608, For ten o'clock. ,Classic
20590," But, but there's nowhere to go. ",Classic
24479, That looks like a Monoid. ,Classic
153468, I don't know. But I think we should talk about it. Unless you would prefer that I took my suspicion to the Immortal.,Classic
161799," I think you're being very unfair. A lot of the acts in the circus require a great deal of skill and courage. That's something you should appreciate. Anyway, I rather fancy entering the Festival talent contest myself. ",Classic
4740, Perhaps it's my materialistic side. How rich and powerful do you have to be to give things away free? ,Classic
126213, Yes? ,Classic
367," Well, maybe he saw something and went off to investigate. ",Classic
148477, I thought you were my mirror image until I realised that I wasn't holding a gun. ,Classic
63331, I can't go to the Minister of Defence and request regular Army support for you on the basis of a wild tale about monsters in caves. ,Classic
123919, So your prayers have not been answered? ,Classic
138453, I think it could be rather important. ,Classic
53319," Did you hear all that, Jimmy? ",Classic
1176," How are you feeling, Barbara? ",Classic
17263, And you haven't seen them? No one in the village has? ,Classic
138326, Please listen. ,Classic
63622," Yes, and about time too. Well I've got to get down to the research centre and try to find an antidote. ",Classic
41041," Aye, a great hairy beastie. ",Classic
90671, But you've built a positive feedback circuit. You're trying to increase your mental powers to infinity. ,Classic
137935, Come on. ,Classic
102700, It's not finished yet. ,Classic
142367," Doctor, slow down. That thing isn't following us. ",Classic
112860, Hello. ,Classic
134435," Nyssa, are you all right? ",Classic
151794, As I thought. You're afraid. ,Classic
15400," Well, there's nothing they can do unless they get inside. ",Classic
101658, Let him try it. ,Classic
21601, We obey!,Classic
154731, Gronwitcher! ,Classic
140829, I can't go along there. I get vertigo. ,Classic
144955, We must gaze upon it. ,Classic
42881," I'm sorry, but some lives are bound to be lost. ",Classic
121914," Doctor! Doctor, I didn't want to be involved in all this. Tell them. Tell them that I only did it for the sake of funding my research. You understand all this. You're a scientist. ",Classic
127723, Whatever for? ,Classic
57485," Oh, surely you've learned not to put all of your eggs in one basket in future? ",Classic
103182, I should be very careful if I were you. ,Classic
11708, All that remains is to put into position the penetration explosive. Daleks controlling device will now report. ,Classic
87039, Sir? ,Classic
165641, Master? Who's he? ,Classic
31425, Yes. ,Classic
76249, Away from the door! ,Classic
79256," No, I don't think so. Hello, what's this?   It seems strangely familiar. Is it yours, Jo? ",Classic
78693, But you saw ,Classic
45174," You're a fool, Salamander. You don't think I've forgotten already, do you? ",Classic
63417, Stop. Do not kill it. It may be useful. Why were you killing it? ,Classic
18359," Yes, well, have patience child. When I've finished with this machine, I'm sure they will release you. ",Classic
94928, Good girl. ,Classic
6033," No, Barbara! Ian agrees with me. He's got to escort the victim to the altar. ",Classic
105119," Oh, rubbish. Electricity's just as good, and a darn sight more reliable. ",Classic
31343," Ben, we're not going to let him out of our sight. ",Classic
161362," ACyberman killed with an arrow? But that's ludicrous, unless. Of course, the head's made of gold. ",Classic
71318, What? ,Classic
84996," What would be the point, Jo? You know what happened to the others. Ordinary treatment won't work. ",Classic
137999," Do so, but you'd only make a fool of yourself. I travel in the Tardis too, now. I have no desire to kill myself. I had no reason to open that roundel. Where are you going? ",Classic
50338," Well, it's a sort of laser gun. You know what that'll do. It'll burn a hole through anything. Metal, concrete, wood, anything! It may look old, but, well, you never know. It just might go off. Now please, just leave things as they were. Where was it? ",Classic
28905," Here, look, there's a church. ",Classic
79854," Yes, if I must. ",Classic
137977, You look so sweet when you get angry. ,Classic
4981, Yes. Is there no break in the wall? Perhaps there's a hidden spring. ,Classic
103331," She really hated me, you know. I did think maybe when this trip was over and I was really rich. I must be getting soft. Now look, there's more than those two aboard. Get the tin brains to make another search and this time do it thoroughly. ",Classic
81514," No. No, there's more to it than that. That sound that you heard, it's all too sophisticated for the Ogrons. ",Classic
38384," It is, I think you will agree, a princely salary. ",Classic
26503," I'm ready to jump like a mountain hare, you come bursting in here like that, Missy. ",Classic
164497, Alone? ,Classic
82479, Pretty close. I can put us down on a general area. ,Classic
2618, But now he's fainted just like Susan did. ,Classic
35448, Lie back there. ,Classic
18012, We have no desire to be here when this planet ceases to exist. ,Classic
144424," We were picking up some sort of random emission, and I, I thought it might be interfering with Kamelion. ",Classic
81189," Will it work, Doctor? ",Classic
48566," Doctor, how many is there? I thought that there was only the one monster.",Classic
3766," Yes, he's been stabbed. ",Classic
14360, Do not bother me with such things now. ,Classic
156706, Favourite? I hate it. ,Classic
64069," Oh, there you are. ",Classic
133715," Compared to some, this one is positively flippant. ",Classic
73124," Chalmers here at the dig, sir. Are you all right? Over, ",Classic
106177, Everywhere. In this place. ,Classic
106695," You are speaking of the Nucleus, the Nucleus of the Swarm. ",Classic
102068, I'm the Doctor. Who are you and why are you shooting at me? ,Classic
137362," Oh look, it's all a long time ago, Doctor. I mean, surely what's past is ",Classic
142372," Then a quick lesson. It can of course occur in many and varied forms, but the type here, capable of creating projections, requires a focus point. ",Classic
2590," And what about what we went through against the Daleks? Not just for us, but for you and Susan too. And all because you tricked us into going down to the city. ",Classic
8540," Ian, look. Fields, crops, it's fully cultivated! ",Classic
19348, They're coming back. ,Classic
87599," The power failure is temporary. Superior Dalek technology will overcome interference shortly. Meanwhile, you will obey our orders. ",Classic
5153, We must go and help him. ,Classic
32206, I hope not. No. ,Classic
113913," Stop messing about down there. Here, catch hold of this. ",Classic
106762, Faster! We must go faster! Now the time for spawning is very close. ,Classic
68996, Hardly. How's the riot going? ,Classic
34563," No, nothing. ",Classic
141004," I don't like it, Doctor. I feel rather unwell. Touch of nausea, I think. ",Classic
91126, WO what? ,Classic
152236, Are you some kind of weirdo? ,Classic
89730, Wait a minute. There could be a time difference. ,Classic
52963, Thank you. ,Classic
117946, No. ,Classic
22259, Of course. I shall do everything in my power. ,Classic
137593," The creature will have left the Tardis by now. He'll need his own life support systems.   I don't remember that. Turlough, find the Tardis and stay with Nyssa and Tegan. Brigadier, I want you to come with me. ",Classic
152147," Oh, I never listen to the foolish things people say about me. I'm too aware of my own mortality, as you should be of yours. ",Classic
118901, Because you always make mistakes. ,Classic
57606," What else can we do, sir? ",Classic
95787, Raise your hands over your heads. Search him. ,Classic
36052," Oh, that's not very polite. I was interested in what you were saying. ",Classic
99222, I do hope you haven't been bored. ,Classic
72845," No, you can't. There are too many of them.   Did he hurt you? ",Classic
4659," Oh, really. ",Classic
31674," Ah! Congratulations, Ben! ",Classic
33679, You know where you are now? ,Classic
71933," Morgan, you can't. ",Classic
27511, No! They are not our people. They must not be allowed in the caves. ,Classic
132241," Forgive me, my dear, but you must be a Worcestershire Talbot. ",Classic
26408," My pleasure.   Boy, you maybe don't realise just how close that was. Well, for what we did not receive, may the good Lord make us truly thankful. ",Classic
67128," Yes, well, the man didn't do a very good job and at the rate we're drilling, that flange could blow at any moment. ",Classic
161205," Wasn't difficult, really. It was me who launched it into space in the first place. This may qualify as the worst miscalculation since life crawled out of the seas on this sad planet. ",Classic
152031, Inform Takis. ,Classic
13106," I don't know. I tell you one thing, if I get the chance, I'm going to find Barbara. ",Classic
11513, There is no work party in shaft nine. Why? ,Classic
21281," Since Vyon is in command, I gave priority to his projection. ",Classic
34408," No, I mean Zaroff and his people cannot exist without food. ",Classic
77075," Yes, I think I'm okay. ",Classic
125741, We shall drain the blood from your bodies slowly. ,Classic
81398, Our soldiers have seen the Earthmen attack us. Our cargoes have been stolen. We are Draconians. We do not lie. ,Classic
35704, But it's going too fast. I can't keep up with it. ,Classic
25658," You are indeed, Doctor. Well done. The three of you have won your little games. ",Classic
47082," I'm sorry, Travers, we have to go. ",Classic
12334," Oh, I see what you're getting at, yes. ",Classic
145911," Chellak has too many troops. The androids are being overrun. Numbers four and nine, fall back to final defence posts. Four! Number four! ",Classic
58511, That's just what I'm going to try and do.,Classic
138926, Yeah. ,Classic
38735, What sort of test? ,Classic
72702, That's better. A few hours sleep and she'll be as right as rain.,Classic
57008," I know, but there's something I've forgotten. ",Classic
106030," Come on. Whatever you do, don't look back. I said don't look back! Let's go. Now! ",Classic
95091, You stay here in case Harry turns up. ,Classic
71563," Come on, move! ",Classic
162497, Entertain us. ,Classic
145978," And you are wasting time, Stotz. ",Classic
10708, Why do you say that? ,Classic
59880, Wir haben hier ,Classic
40086, Well? ,Classic
32834, Perkins. ,Classic
90343, There are only four of us. You have to have five. ,Classic
87964, It is understood. ,Classic
28837," Oh, yes, I've been waiting around here for her. Where is she? I very nearly left without her. ",Classic
61030," You see, Señor Villar? We're not talking nonsense. ",Classic
36446," He means they've struck so much gas they can't channel it off. When it reaches a certain density, that alarm bell goes. ",Classic
124782, You went to the marsh? ,Classic
54921, She's not going into that machine! ,Classic
60468, Nothing of importance. ,Classic
29237," Well, it's quite obvious to the perceptive eye, sir. Your dress, your manner, your taste. Yes, you're the type of man that has raised himself to an exalted position unaided. Hmm, hmm. ",Classic
3708," Marco, I have something rather interesting to show you. ",Classic
136986, Turlough! ,Classic
123663, The Screens of Zolfa-Thura. ,Classic
62402," It may be difficult to grasp but that's the situation we've got to deal with. You will place your men under my orders, is that clear? ",Classic
129119," That, sir, is our official history. ",Classic
60536," Yes, I think so, Zoe. Now let me see. ",Classic
113977," Oh, back at Miss Fay's cottage. ",Classic
15640, Just tell me what you've done. ,Classic
69342," All right. If you feel fit, you can take charge of the underground assault party. Major Cosworth will put you in the picture. ",Classic
155024, I authorised no mayday signal. My Communications officer is attacked and then you appear. ,Classic
44201," Lies, truth, who knows. But we wouldn't like to put them to the test, would we, huh?   There. ",Classic
47221, They what? ,Classic
61144, Previously you thought the resistance to be the winning side. What made you change your mind? ,Classic
39734, Return to your work. ,Classic
22205," I know, but I didn't check. How could I? The old man fooled us. The Daleks should have checked before they fitted it, before they let the old man go. ",Classic
21943," Well, not mine exactly. Well, let's say it belongs to us, eh? So why don't you leave it where it is and just move along, eh? ",Classic
3895," Yesterday, my lord. ",Classic
1839, I know what you mean. We must help the Thals to save themselves and not just them help us. ,Classic
147099, Bye. ,Classic
158189, Can you not do better than that? ,Classic
16473, Do not move. Answer my question. ,Classic
47616," You've been unnerving my crew. Now you, get out! ",Classic
26367, He's no right to take chances with Steven's life! Those men mean what they say. ,Classic
62569," Well, now, I'm not sure. They seem to be hushing it up. ",Classic
62027," It is necessary, Hibbert. He saw the security area and all this. Think! Think. Then you see that it is necessary. ",Classic
52071," Well, it's the one you're stuck with for the moment. ",Classic
131390, What? I suppose it does a bit. ,Classic
156952," Gentlemen, such hostility. Remember, blessed are the pie makers for they shall make light pastry. ",Classic
162556, Perhaps I might relieve you of that. ,Classic
132365, Hoot. Oh yes. ,Classic
43951, Yes. ,Classic
140094," Unhand him. He is a man of honour. Lord Ranulf, is there a dungeon in this castle? ",Classic
153280, It doesn't respond. ,Classic
93803," Kravos, I saved your life once. In your chest is a tiny instrument which I designed. It keeps your heart beating. Will you now turn that heart against me? ",Classic
119854, What? ,Classic
51946, Two. ,Classic
125217, Exo-space? ,Classic
100891," So, be careful. ",Classic
20837," Doctor, don't you see? It's a trap. That's exactly what they want us to do. ",Classic
31215, Earth Examiner. Accord every access. Vulcan. ,Classic
22136," Oh, I've no idea. I'm glad we got away. ",Classic
18264, I don't particularly want to be here at all. ,Classic
159881, What was that? ,Classic
141796, Maddox's conditioning disc. You were ordered to return it to me. ,Classic
49999," Well, keep it on blue stand by for now. There's bound to be a cloud of smaller stuff following on behind. ",Classic
38236," I'll explain to you one day. Well, come along out. You look like a soldier in a sentry box standing there. Sit down.  It's all right, he's a friend. Now sit down while I find the others. Ah! Inspector Crossland. There we are. Now, Ben, Polly and back to Gatwick.",Classic
128209, Earth people? ,Classic
78151, That is my fear. Our world is in great danger. Come!,Classic
20178," Never mind that. It shrinks. Now, allow me to demonstrate. You place the flying machine thus, as you would an arrow in a bow, and let it go. ",Classic
60839," Nous combattons le. Er, sorry, my French isn't up to it. ",Classic
161775, There's still one question you haven't answered. ,Classic
128609,MASTER   [ ,Classic
108174, Yes. ,Classic
151537," Vena. Vena, try not to be so pessimistic. We may still have a chance, if I can just contact them. ",Classic
40340," I can't see any change, Vic. ",Classic
121505," The same way I knew we could get into the Tardis. Tryst doesn't realise what he's stumbled on. At least, I don't think he has. ",Classic
25538," Let's read this first. Lady Luck will show the way, win the game or here you'll stay. ",Classic
101844, Shush. ,Classic
102549, Move! ,Classic
55396, You're breaking my arm! ,Classic
139055, What? ,Classic
141362, Missiles are locked onto targets. ,Classic
152627, I sent for them. ,Classic
138961, Huh. Hardly a flying ship. ,Classic
77212, Ready to isolate transfer macrovisor. ,Classic
3511," Hmm? Barbara? Oh yes, of course. Yes, yes, we mustn't waste time. No. Come on. Now, let's see if we can find the spirits.",Classic
156778," I say, I mean, we may not see eye to eye. Try and see it my way. I'm trying not to be personal. I mean, after all, a bat may look at a Time Lord. ",Classic
123163," Come on, Romana, quick. ",Classic
118982, I just wanted to see. ,Classic
165645, So what's all this in aid of? ,Classic
30551, How are we going to survive?! ,Classic
50708," An unintelligent enemy is far less dangerous than an intelligent one, Jamie. ",Classic
135631," Please, Doctor, help me. ",Classic
62033, Killed? Who got killed? ,Classic
12573," Doctor, what's happening? ",Classic
72854, That's nonsense. All the Master will bring upon you is disaster! ,Classic
58249," Just a minute, where are you going? ",Classic
112815, The insolent breath of idle fantasy! Death comes now! ,Classic
120108, Really? ,Classic
37192," Yeah, I'm okay. ",Classic
73123," Greyhound Two, come in, please. Over. ",Classic
137713," Come on, Doctor, we've got to get out of here. ",Classic
7765, I have never thought of that. ,Classic
93731, Some of them can move about. ,Classic
122451, No. Why should I have seen her? ,Classic
79870, Out! Make for the hills! ,Classic
137044," Right, into bed with you, young man. ",Classic
46111," Don't know. Well, between you and me, I couldn't get out, see. The gates were locked. ",Classic
102509," Jabel, thank you. I   Jabel. Jabel, that's Leela. ",Classic
138463, He didn't have it. He's delirious. He needs Hydromel. ,Classic
26443," Well, we've got to find her, fast. ",Classic
3622," Ping-Cho, you will remove your belongings to another room. From this night on, you will not share with Susan again. ",Classic
115256," Good. Well, that means the Count has Romana, the real Princess and the Prince. ",Classic
134177," Tegan, wait! All of you, stay here. ",Classic
40214, Remember what I said. Be very careful. ,Classic
127556," Consul Tremas, I have orders to secure the plan of the Source Manipulator. You will please hand it over. ",Classic
23769, I have but to give the order. ,Classic
156215, Is it your contention that the Doctor was solely responsible for devising the scheme we are presently reviewing on the Matrix? ,Classic
26923, That ridiculous young man. He thought I'd made a mistake. ,Classic
108657, Then I shall kill him before he does. ,Classic
116957, Right. ,Classic
128421," Yes, well, it's the age-old battle, isn't it? Entropy versus structure. Still, while there's life there's six of one and half a dozen of the other. ",Classic
33469," Aye, and that is the way you will remain, Mister Trask.",Classic
66647," You really think this is the end, don't you? ",Classic
31404, Guard!   The Examiner is missing. He must be found immediately.,Classic
155476, Without his jacket or his watch? ,Classic
126316, The accuracy of this unit has deteriorated below zero utility. ,Classic
97788, What kind of work is that? ,Classic
29628," Tomorrow night, then, sir, at the time arranged. ",Classic
79769," Well, you are really, aren't you. ",Classic
40563," Oh, let me help him, please. ",Classic
69898," That won't help you, Filer! ",Classic
73582," Well, they were sort of guerillas, I suppose. ",Classic
139772, Others shall do it for me. ,Classic
4497," No, my lord. They would not believe half the things that I have seen in Cathay. But what is the truth? I wonder where they are now? The past or the future? ",Classic
163549," Ace, have you no sense of occasion? ",Classic
154016, Yeah. ,Classic
38144," Here, look. ",Classic
138841, The White Guardian may try and make contact again. ,Classic
109630," We're trapped. Don't you understand, Doctor? We're trapped. ",Classic
130871, I'll go after him. ,Classic
124545, It's you people who talk like Deciders. ,Classic
90693, It's all right. He is not dead. ,Classic
95050," Commander Broton, the Doctor and the female human have just driven into the village. ",Classic
38478, He wants to see us. ,Classic
108168, Affirmative. ,Classic
95780, Is this where the thing lives? ,Classic
96280," Oh, no, sir. Not by a long chalk! ",Classic
46497, Okay. ,Classic
132840, I'm going to talk some sense into the Doctor. ,Classic
17933, It's caught! ,Classic
31355, Who is? ,Classic
30705," Look, tell him he can't use this bomb, Barclay. We'll all go up with it! ",Classic
80092, Where's Mister Ollis? ,Classic
146302, What do you mean? ,Classic
98648, They were flying a private plane. ,Classic
85391, Are Sir Edward's men so ill fed? Bah! I make nothing of their Norman scribbles. What's it say? ,Classic
120000, And if she's not? ,Classic
115095," That's why we brought him a permanent nurse for his bedside. Hold her, Kurster. Lamia. ",Classic
49135," The Controller, Jarvis Bennett, wanted to destroy the rocket. ",Classic
32857," German. And I know more about the English law than you do, it seems. ",Classic
8722, Help! Can you hear me? ,Classic
68756," Tonight, I will kill the American delegate. ",Classic
86208, Listen. ,Classic
117114," I like you, Doctor. ",Classic
18954, Chills? ,Classic
152035, I must make contact with the others. ,Classic
119688," Yes! You see the Count as a master criminal, an art dealer, an insanely wealthy man, and you'd like to see yourself as his consort. But what's he doing in the cellar? ",Classic
100932, You cannot refuse. ,Classic
18052," We won't be long, Vicki. I promise we won't get lost.",Classic
29412, My word should be enough. ,Classic
72514," I must admit, that thing took me completely by surprise. ",Classic
120131, You were his assistant. You must know what he knew. ,Classic
158192," Thank you. Oh, thank you. Thank you, thank you, sir. Thank you, thank you gentlemen. Thank you, thank you, thank you. ",Classic
133799, You will meet me there. ,Classic
52689, Submit! ,Classic
54256," No, Mister Vaughn, I can. Given a little time, I'm sure I can!",Classic
123494, Mena is dying. ,Classic
73234, He's over here!   Sergeant! ,Classic
25181," There, child. Isn't that an arm? Not much of one, I grant you, but nevertheless, a real arm. ",Classic
142478, What are you doing? ,Classic
86319," Sir, I am the scientific advisor to UNIT, and I demand to be put in immediate touch with Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart. ",Classic
22688, Then why did it burn out and not the Tardis controls? ,Classic
84349," Wretched fellow needs a swift kick on the backside. Would you care to administer, Jeremy? ",Classic
38227, I'm going to try and find my three friends and the Inspector. You know where they are? ,Classic
121427, Yes. Er. ,Classic
39937," Oh, yes. One in that section, and one in that section over there. Activated, I imagine, by this simple logical system over here. Here we are, I think.   Yes, splendid, splendid. A simple logical gate. ",Classic
100864, Yes. ,Classic
156935," Time is getting short if we are to be ready for the solstice, mistress. ",Classic
27785, Right. ,Classic
149446," Scared more like. Hiding out in Redfern Dell. Reckon tha should go to him, sir. ",Classic
66372, When did you first become a traitor? ,Classic
63560, You don't understand ,Classic
23505, What did he say? ,Classic
160946, Precisely. ,Classic
145465," You have the mouth of a prattling jackanapes but your eyes, they tell a different story. It's of no matter. I shall break you to my will. And if I can't break you, I shall kill you, while you, my child, shall live forever. ",Classic

102170, We'll be torn to pieces! ,Classic
78029," Yes, but that means leaving the lab unwatched.",Classic
30908, No need. I'm here. ,Classic
138409," Thank you. Most kind. Most kind. My name is, er, Bor. I. Haven't we met somewhere before? ",Classic
27012," We have built into the city a life-giving sun of our own. Isn't that right, Avon? ",Classic
102778," Doctor. I've been waiting for you. Yes, come in please. ",Classic
155942," I could make you a fair offer on a job lot, do you a very good deal. ",Classic
62853, You're not the only one. ,Classic
72405," Doctor. Doctor, wake up. ",Classic
150041," Well, yes, but ",Classic
4627," We always hoped to find a way of modifying it and making it again irresistible. So instead of destroying it, we removed the five key microcircuits. ",Classic
5105, I don't know. It sounds like whispering. He said it would begin when darkness came. That must be what Susan heard. ,Classic
24149," Well, how are you able to make your spaceship enter ours? ",Classic
38581, Then it's a forgery. ,Classic
20138, They don't know you as well as we do. ,Classic
134968," Not at all, Doctor. You shall have it when you give me the correctly programmed temporal limiter. ",Classic
149189," Not one of its most tranquil, I agree. ",Classic
28583," No, Sir Charles. I think the police might find it too big for them to handle at the moment. ",Classic
19584, You have had my last warning. Do as I say. ,Classic
35405, This one has not received neurotrope X. Stand back. ,Classic
89054," Yes, Ortron. We intend to join our people in the mines. ",Classic
151303, We have captured the Doctor's companion and some of the rebels at Falchian Rocks. ,Classic
25818," Sure, Seth, sure. We're friends, ain't we? Ain't we in this together? ",Classic
17275, I think somebody's coming. ,Classic
65733," How you came here is of no importance to me. You're here. We see them everywhere. Advisors on this, advisors on that.   Look, there's another one. ",Classic
90274, I think they'll find I'm rather a tough old bird. ,Classic
147768, And we have a crew. ,Classic

102633," What's happening? Tesh, what is it? You answer while you still have a head to answer with. ",Classic
139239, Human? ,Classic
116362," I asked you to stop the ritual, Ranquin. That's all I did, I swear that. ",Classic
150187," I am too, Jamie McCrimmon. I am another aspect of him, just as he is of me. ",Classic
53246, He has a machine. ,Classic
52113," Aye, this place gives me the creeps. ",Classic
78126, You have not the power to control him! ,Classic
140163, And the blue engine. ,Classic
34029, I can't think of how I came to be so clumsy. I must have bumped into it. ,Classic
84851," Jo, look out! ",Classic
150331," What gives you that idea? No, I was going to say but at least you'll have the satisfaction of knowing that you have been part of a great undertaking. ",Classic
36643, It's reads zero. ,Classic
6147, I shall lead the armies. It is my right. ,Classic
59283, Don't ever come through that door without knocking! Get out! ,Classic
64398, Something wrong? ,Classic
76244, I can't hold it much longer. ,Classic
152019, I'll find you a new one. ,Classic
13100, You. Go and see if they're outside.,Classic
141672," No, sir. ",Classic
101983," Shush, shush, shush. I want you to do exactly as I say. You and I are going to walk away from here very slowly and very quietly. And no matter what happens, you mustn't cry out or make any sudden move. And above all, you mustn't run until I tell you. Is that clear?   Good. Now come on. Come on.   Freeze. ",Classic
110034, I invest you Lord President of the Supreme Council. I wish you good fortune and strength. I give you the Matrix.   ,Classic
95479," Three and a half minutes, Doctor, and still no sign of Broton in the conference hall. ",Classic
89065," How very convenient. Let there be no more of this foolishness, your Majesty. You can see for yourself the results of defying the Ice Warriors. Guard her. ",Classic
137814, Are you two all right? ,Classic
9620," Oh, so now anyone can walk in. ",Classic
20513, I'm sure he's out on the plain. You've got to go and look for him and find him. If you bring him back you'll prove yourself the warrior you really are. He'll be your prisoner then as well as Paris'. ,Classic
148193, The comparator? ,Classic
65725, The instigator? You make it sound as if I'd perpetrated some crime against humanity. ,Classic
49867, See for yourself. Less than a million miles now. Closing on an elliptical path tilted ten degrees. ,Classic
37099," Oh, I am sure that'll make all the difference. ",Classic
165840, What happened? ,Classic
132067," What? Oh, yes. ",Classic
84877, Freedom from freedom. ,Classic
129809," Well, now you're being unreasonable, Nyssa. One simply can't compare his Majesty to the Master. ",Classic
114818, What's that? Is it yours? ,Classic
98669," You say might. What you mean is, you don't know. ",Classic
80811, What? ,Classic
118830, Two spacefleets totally impotent. ,Classic
90940, Insufficient data. Please be more specific. ,Classic
158493," You too, Weismuller? Whoever they are, I plan to get even. ",Classic
61872," There's no point in going on with this, Mister Ransome. Goodbye. ",Classic
139744, Hidden in the Doctor's mind. ,Classic
162950, And where did you find the scabbard? ,Classic
46254," Yes, certain of it. Why else would he lock us in? ",Classic
81838, Doctor? Are you sure you're all right? ,Classic
71412, Where are they going? ,Classic
105708," Look, I'm a businessman. How could there be anything wrong?  Here's the message. I've written it in code. ",Classic
137135," Any time. Come on, let's get back to the Tardis. ",Classic
109841, Unidentified?   Only two Time Lords are absent from their duties here on authorised research missions. You will find their molecular codes in ,Classic
70617, Then just why have you come here? ,Classic
54411, Not unless we can stop the Cyber-control signals. ,Classic
104994," Whatever it was, there can be no escape for you. Let the talons of Weng-Chiang shred your flesh! ",Classic
34519," I, I'll stay. ",Classic
157619, But what? ,Classic
61065, That's exactly what they wanted. Have any of the guards returned? ,Classic
60232," Yes of course, just as you do. But only the War Chief knows the timing. Now really, I am very busy. ",Classic
67732," Well, out with it. ",Classic
9552," It was the only way, Barbara. ",Classic
70605," How do you do? Well, I must say this is all most impressive. ",Classic
43838," Only the accent? My dear young lady. Oh, dear. Now, what was it he said.   We still cannot guarantee good summer holidays for all. No. Guarantee. No, no. Guaran. Guarantee. You see, it's very difficult. Of course, I always was interested in phonetics. Holidays. Summer. Summer. He must have come from Mexico. Quintana Roo or Yucatan I shouldn't wonder. ",Classic
37697, They won't escape me. ,Classic
161586, Excellent. Their arrival is imminent. ,Classic
19955," Yes, but better to be on the safe side. Don't you think? ",Classic
106710," Hurry, hurry. It is time for the spawning. I must get to the place prepared on Titan. ",Classic
90431, Sabor! Father! Where are you? ,Classic
89798, You have done well. ,Classic
126983," Very well, but you know the law. The vote must be unanimous. Consuls, it is proposed that we summon the Keeper. Those in favour raise your hands.   Consul Seron. ",Classic
142176, Hmm. I can understand why. ,Classic
66763," They're going to suspend it, pending a full review of the project. Where the devil are we? It looks like the middle of nowhere. All right, Patterson, what's going on? ",Classic
159231, Starflight drive? It can't be.   This is a spacecraft. The whole colony's a spacecraft! ,Classic
165730, Like I could run forever. I can smell things as clear as pictures.,Classic
57070, Is that all you've done? ,Classic
116832, Surely nothing can live in this? The radiation levels alone ,Classic
21792," Oh, nonsense. ",Classic
69260, Helping who? ,Classic
71208, You go back to the colony and persuade your friends to get off this planet. ,Classic
5436," Yes, and that's the only element of the case I don't understand. My men did a heat reflector search of this room. It is absolutely certain that the micro-key isn't in here. It is equally certain that it's not been taken from here. ",Classic
136189, And I'm sure we're all truly grateful. Shall we proceed to the Chamber of the Mara? ,Classic
107243, Next of kin? ,Classic
131349, What? The Doctor said nothing eventful had occurred. ,Classic
115847," When we put ten full scale refineries in here, there'll be no room for the natives and they know it. ",Classic
163092, Like that. Look! ,Classic
39670, ADalek questioned an order. ,Classic
54483," Oh, there you are. Can you hear me, Mister Vaughn?",Classic
122419," Strength, seven thousand three hundred megazones. ",Classic
94021," Now, who are you? How'd you get here? ",Classic
37822," Hello, Gatwick Airport. This is RAF241. How do you read me?",Classic
4444, What's Tegana's game? ,Classic
117242," Yes, it'll give you time to save your neck.   Well? ",Classic
165095," Okay. You stay here. If I'm not back in ten minutes, abort the mission. Take this.",Classic
10616," Thank you, Doctor. ",Classic
132265," First rate, sir. ",Classic
3718," Tegana, are you absolutely positive? ",Classic
100027, Why would they leave her here? ,Classic
159417, Nothing you possess will be effective against what's in there! ,Classic
7136, Do you hear that? ,Classic
143024, The systems failed. ,Classic
139863," You're too modest, Lord Doctor. Come, rejoice with us in a trial by combat. Come, make way for our demons. Let them be seated by us. ",Classic
33864," Later? Oh, I wish I understood. ",Classic
71852, Do you think they were hurt? ,Classic
141277," If there is enemy activity outside, we could go to missile run, so stand by. ",Classic
154509," What? He was fine a moment ago. Cardiac arrest. His body's reacting to the drugs.   You'll not die on me, you fish-faced monster. ",Classic
152706," Oh, don't you start. ",Classic
25667, Doctor! ,Classic
74618," So, Arcturus was behind everything.",Classic
50590, Travel capsules only take two. ,Classic
49291," Go into to Spares and ask them to check their Bernalium stock, will you? ",Classic
104015, Nine. There was some fellow in here earlier blaming Chang of all people for some girl's disappearance. ,Classic
25965," Oh, well, I'll have to ask you to sign the book here. ",Classic
79255," Yes, and felt it too. Could it be that stuff outside? ",Classic
165693, Yeah. ,Classic
2617, Help him? You saw him. You saw what he tried to do. ,Classic
143763, She's sleeping naturally. ,Classic
148170," Yes. Yes, I did. Very well, arrange it. And Bax ",Classic
106524, Yes. If we can just make some sort of barrier. ,Classic
28075, Is this your first time in London? ,Classic
142088," Nonsense, my dear. Just a bit of fun. ",Classic
158156, Right. ,Classic
47056," What do you mean, Doctor? ",Classic
56551," We've only got enough food and water for three days, remember?",Classic
144615, Peri. ,Classic
54876," Aye, it smells dead. ",Classic
126396," The whole of this domain, the ancient arch, the mirrors. ",Classic
90370," Intelligence as a concept. The simplistic notion that the intelligence quotient   Quotient. Result given by dividing one quantity by another. It's no use. I don't understand the words. I'll have to ask someone what's happened to me. Yates. He's my friend, I think. I'll ask Mister Yates. ",Classic
84490," Yes, quite right, quite right. And where is this egg now? ",Classic
95647, How many have you lost? ,Classic
29024," Oh, we shall return to the Tardis, my boy, when the tide recedes and let's hope that we materialize in nineteen sixty six. ",Classic
120062," Well, of course it is, of a sort. ",Classic
110596, I hope not. You get after him before he tries again. ,Classic
136552," Oh, my Lord. ",Classic
150463, But she could have no knowledge of the Doctor. How would that be possible? ,Classic
34071, Huh? ,Classic
134474, No. Adric's dead. ,Classic
75285, Trenchard here. There is a Miss Grant on her way down to you. She is not to leave.,Classic
152514, Reception area. Good luck. ,Classic
159351, Well that's easy ,Classic
134334, The creatures you saw are particles of protoplasm bonded by psychic energy. The essential protoplasm can take any shape. ,Classic
89568, All right. ,Classic
97268, I prefer our Harry.,Classic
103654, It isn't far. ,Classic
116403," Yes, wasn't it. Let's get out of here before it changes its mind. ",Classic
11260," In quite a while, I might be able to travel. ",Classic
4826, It's mine. ,Classic
118992, I wonder why he did it like that? The face of the clock is fractured. ,Classic
95008, How did you bring that creature to the Earth? ,Classic
44853," Not now, we are too busy. ",Classic
57331, You reel it out and I'll make the connections. ,Classic
111562, There's some obstruction. ,Classic
52115, Is that really Jamie? ,Classic
56468," Oh, no. This is worse than the Tardis.",Classic
77382," Well, there's thaesium radiation in the chamber where they took us. Cotton told me. ",Classic
117460, It's fully automated. There are no Zeons on Zeos. ,Classic
45479, No. I think we'd better tread carefully. Let's go and find out what's going on first. ,Classic
102224, So that means Andor and the others ,Classic
26274," Oh, was on the run, leastways till he met up with Wyatt Earp. Since then he's usually managed to keep right side of the law. That's why for the first time I guess he's gonna settle down. ",Classic
85752," By the stars, Bloodaxe, I swear I'll chop him up so fine not even a sparrow will fill its beak at one peck. ",Classic
12663, Five hundred! ,Classic
93113, You'll notice the requisition is countersigned by Davros himself. If you would like to take the matter up with him. ,Classic
111420, I'm not old. What? ,Classic
625, The creatures. Where? Where? ,Classic
139172, Man the topsail. ,Classic
72273," Thank you. Doctor! Doctor, please!",Classic
66684, But this isn't a vehicle at all. ,Classic
157912," Well, you Kangs, what do you say to that? ",Classic
30913, I must protest. ,Classic
150154, I'm not a well man. ,Classic
10576," That's the idea. Come on, get hold of it. Right. ",Classic
113598," What? Look, I only want to know about our mission. ",Classic
114006," Steady, K9. ",Classic
17237," Mead? Oh, mead. Yes, of course, yes. Yes, how nice of you, yes. Delightful, thank you, thank you. Well, here's to your very good health.   Oh, delightful. Oh, yes, delightful. Tell me, is the monastery near here? ",Classic
24880," That might be worse, my dear. Besides, I'm not only invisible, I'm intangible, which means that I can't pull the switches. ",Classic
134852, Possibly a telepathic projection. Perhaps he isn't really dead.,Classic
6673, Tlotoxl thanks you. ,Classic
120445, It's burning! I've never seen metal like that before. ,Classic
77317," The accusation is that you mounted a massive operation to convert the atmosphere to one breathable by humans, but not by the native population. ",Classic
124106," We should be on the surface. yes, yes, I know. Come along, I'll need you too. ",Classic
20770, All right. ,Classic
44809, Your confidence. ,Classic
10540, Well then what? ,Classic
81311, One watches. ,Classic
39471," It's no good. He won't help us. Don't worry, Kemel. I shall protect you. I shall see they do you no harm. Yes, I suppose it was a bit silly.     You think so? I wish I did. Oh well, maybe between us we can fight them. We must face it out together.",Classic
67921," Farrel, be careful. Careful. I don't want an accident. ",Classic
62148," Don't worry, Mister Seeley, we'll let your wife know where you are. Now, about the meteorites? ",Classic
137618, What? ,Classic
135504, I trust you know what you are doing? ,Classic
120554, Why? ,Classic
140494, The Doctor has been taken out of time. ,Classic
64836," I've saved you a journey, haven't I. ",Classic
107583," It ate life? All life, including that of its own kind? ",Classic
33828, That we shall find out very soon. ,Classic
54383," Yes. Right, I've got him. ",Classic
59057," Caven! The Doctor and his friends, they attacked me. I was lucky to get away with my life. ",Classic
140283, Turlough! ,Classic
91461," Don't just stand there, Benton. Go and help Miss Smith. ",Classic
47099," Well, not from the Yeti, no, but who knows, they might suddenly start the trains again! Come on! ",Classic
158360," Well, there is just one last chance. ",Classic
19019," Seize them! All of you listen! The success of all we stand for, everything aboard this spaceship is suddenly endangered by the strange fever. A fever brought by these strangers in our midst! ",Classic
40451," It's all right, Victoria. You're all right now. ",Classic
60886, Arturo Villar. Now he's the one we've got to convince. ,Classic
83886, Do you know anything about entomology? ,Classic
65496, Do you really think you should go ahead with this broadcast? ,Classic
70606, We found these two in sector twenty seven. They say they're explorers. ,Classic
107012," The strangers, then. ",Classic
122882," Well, I've just seen a whole lot more rampaging down the corridor. Face it, Soldeed, you're being invaded. ",Classic
128154, It gives us time. ,Classic
147949, Excellent. You will all accompany me. ,Classic
123551, Not the Randomiser. ,Classic
117362," Affirmative, mistress.   Finished, mistress. ",Classic
64311, We took several prisoners. One of them knows a great deal more than he's saying. ,Classic
5513, Where did you get it? ,Classic
146793," No, Doctor. If necessary, she must die. ",Classic
13886, Come.,Classic
64388," Tracking report. Height eighty five miles, still reducing. Speed eighteen thousand reducing to seventeen thousand. Sixteen thousand. ",Classic
155334, Brown study? Is the vocabulary of all the Time Lords so antediluvian? ,Classic
94280," Tibias, or rather fetlocks, like a carthorse. ",Classic
143420," You mean, it just looks pretty. ",Classic
40115, Well? ,Classic
1477, Yes. ,Classic
84132," Well, I've only quoted what the technical fellow told me. ",Classic
67758," I've sent the staff home as you ordered, Colonel. ",Classic
163172, A warrior maid. ,Classic
71021," You're the Captain, why didn't you go? He isn't going to get back to his friends, is he. ",Classic
16764," You all right, child? Come along!",Classic
37990," You seem to know a lot about it, Inspector. ",Classic
61781," Oh, you're a poacher, are you? ",Classic
79217," Well, Sergeant, aren't you going to say it that it's bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. Everybody else does. ",Classic
65107, I can hear you. G-force hard to break. ,Classic
117434, Yes. ,Classic
35640, A lot of good that is. ,Classic
138583," You represent a poor investment of my time and energy, and for such an investment there is only one course to follow. ",Classic
127462, The Source. Has it survived? ,Classic
112323, My guts are flattened. ,Classic
159594, Ace! Ace! Open the door! Ace! Open ,Classic
120912," Doctor, what happened? ",Classic
129904, What's the matter? ,Classic
10643,   Hello! Pretty deserted. Probably Sunday. ,Classic
49868," Well, thank goodness for that. Must be one of the other sections.",Classic
8691, Never mind. I'll find him. ,Classic
23266, I thought you must be. Most wise people are at home by this time. It's almost time for the curfew. ,Classic
109389, See the source?   Got it with that one? ,Classic
42283, Archaeology. What good's that? ,Classic
21144," We were here first, let's go and get it. ",Classic
104144," Careful as I am, Lord, there is always risk of discovery. Even tonight I acted quickly to keep our secret. A man was on his way to police. ",Classic
102233, Attack! ,Classic
33661,"   Doctor von Wer at your service. Remedies for the ague, the twitch, the colic, the warts and the gout. ",Classic
37087," Aye, the name's up outside. The body was lying just here. ",Classic
18493," Splendid, splendid. I think I can put into effect the transference of power from my ship to this. Now, first of all, I must have a conversion. Now is that possible? ",Classic
13891," Yes, look. ",Classic
8322, Ah. So you believe that another Sensorite is working with him?  1 ,Classic
8396," You were right about the ambush, weren't you. ",Classic
33838, Where's this? Polly? Jamie? ,Classic
114576," You're wrong, your Honour. There's one other witness I can call. ",Classic
48307, The doors! ,Classic
75211, Where were we indeed? Ships must be kept away from this area. ,Classic
41584," I will fetch some water. Stay close to her, Thomni. ",Classic
55215," Zoe! Now, just you listen to me. Whatever else they are, these Krotons are certainly not friendly. Now we know that, don't we? ",Classic
89850, Is it speaking to you? What's it saying? ,Classic
66577, Brigade Leader? ,Classic
101014, Do you think that I would not be prepared for my return? ,Classic
32984, Prince Charlie's personal standard. ,Classic
120498," Torvin, are you, are you all right?   I, I feel ",Classic
89666, And it was from him I first learnt how to look into my mind. ,Classic
90128," She calls his name, Sabor, as though she was searching for him. ",Classic
155879, My lady. ,Classic
29840, We will. ,Classic
63567," Not exactly. A rock wall appeared in front of us, and then it vanished again. ",Classic
58229, Well I don't think that's likely. All our freighters show the Issigri nose-cone when they're in commission.   I designed it myself. ,Classic
129383," Doctor, don't we have some kind of a sonic ",Classic
69011," All right, Yates, good luck. Keep HQ informed of your movements. I'll be in contact tomorrow morning.",Classic
20381," Well, but I, I ",Classic
147828, This one too. ,Classic
32075," You haven't disarmed the Dalek. Well, go on, take the gun away. We don't want any accidents. Now, what about the girl? ",Classic
158366," If I can get the hatchling safely to the Brood planet, then I can take my case to judgement. They will then send an expeditionary force to get rid of Gavrok and his Bannermen. ",Classic
116480, But I don't understand. There was no delay in the cut-out. ,Classic
90690," Please, don't die. ",Classic
10784, I'm as active as anybody else. ,Classic
69263," Oh, what's he promised you? ",Classic
142072, See to the other Silurian there. ,Classic
63425, Try once more. ,Classic
35058," Oh, I see what you mean. Yes, of course. How stupid of me. ",Classic
129037, It's impossible! ,Classic
17005," Now come along, child. Pull your self together ",Classic
164175," Control, quintessence of wickedness, corruption incarnate. ",Classic
61279," By your Tardis travel machines, of course. ",Classic
60893, Right. ,Classic
128301," But how? Surely in a closed system like the universe, entropy is bound to increase? ",Classic
51103," But where? It mustn't be far. I mean, look at Kando. ",Classic
107930, Foundry or smelting? ,Classic
80534," They're new, Vorg. They're strangers.",Classic
4006," Let us all go, I appeal to you. What possible difference could it make to you? You hate Marco. ",Classic
71354, Very well. We'll be over in a few minutes. Untie them. ,Classic
141942, The Doctor. ,Classic
139046, Now wait a minute. Wetsuits? What are wetsuits doing on an Edwardian sailing ship? ,Classic
63951,   What good will that do them? ,Classic
118711, You will be obeyed. ,Classic
4916," I did hear it, you know. ",Classic
67368," Brigadier, there are times when you strongly remind me of your other self. I shall leave at once. ",Classic
61558," I won't forget you. Don't go blundering into too much trouble, will you? ",Classic
6546, But it is a great honour for me to be chosen. I shall take her as my bride. ,Classic
110143," Actions so far indicate a success probability along this path analysis, thirty nine point seven five. ",Classic
50796," They'll attract too much attention. We'd never get past the capsule managers. Still, no problem. We can always fix you up with some Dulcian garments. ",Classic
65938," But surely, Brigadier, this matter comes under the jurisdiction of the medical section, or security? It's a personnel problem. It's got nothing whatsoever to do with the technical side of this operation. ",Classic
22746, This is serious. Perhaps the Daleks have caught him? ,Classic
48236," I know, I know. ",Classic
18930," Well, we didn't. It has a mind of its own. ",Classic
736, Don't stop. ,Classic
57712, Decoys? ,Classic
164693," Twenty four hours, Dudman, or I shall have you dismissed from service. ",Classic
148235," Ah, but hatred of yourself as well. We all have some parts of our mind that we consider unworthy, some memory that makes us shudder and squirm. Do you know what my process of transmutation does? It focuses on the seeds of fear in your mind and makes them grow until you, your body, your face, your entire being, transforms into the image in your mind. You should turn into something quite interesting. A reptile, or something simian perhaps. ",Classic
116449, What's a single life? Where are the dryfoots now? ,Classic
164241, It is. ,Classic
85620," I am occupied, Irongron. ",Classic
1251," Yes, his breathing's so bad. What do you think, Barbara? ",Classic
68307," After him, quick!",Classic
35479, Why? ,Classic
110424," Well, as much as I dare. ",Classic
132337, Is that dancing? ,Classic
88592," Well, not at all, your Majesty. In fact I was delighted to meet Aggedor again. ",Classic
58271, Oh. ,Classic
24218," Yes, we're constructing it by hand using the ancient methods. It's for our children and our children's children, so that they can watch it grow gradually as time goes by. ",Classic
26933, We have come to welcome you. ,Classic
95893," Unless you abandon those canisters, yes. ",Classic
134106, This thing is smaller on the inside than it is on the outside.   Wait here. ,Classic
121148, What's the matter? ,Classic
9234, Barbara! ,Classic
130822, I still give the orders. ,Classic
118848, Was Commander Sharrel with them? ,Classic
66802," No, I don't. I mean the fire extinguisher. ",Classic
127166, These readings were taken before we arrived. ,Classic
13681," No. They are just cattle. They do not have any speech nor motive of their own. Just controlled sentries. We came here to liberate them. It was disaster. Vrestin, the others, we arrived in advance of the spearhead. Our weapons proved useless. They were taken by the Zarbi who were everywhere. The three of us you met in the cave got away with the communicator, but we could not contact our spearhead. ",Classic
63525," Well, they're not my people, but I think I could convince them, on the condition that you release those trapped men first. ",Classic
159259, Before I go I'd like to say ,Classic
97953, Give arm now. Condo not kill. ,Classic
97445," Okay, XK-5. Stand by, stand by. ",Classic
123884," Thank you, mistress. Repairs complete. ",Classic
52730," The Doctor is expendable. Expendable. He will be destroyed. Oh, no, no. He's the only person. There's nobody else. I can't go on for ever. Oh, please, please give me another chance. You have failed. The Master Brain must be protected against overloading. Robot force will deal with him.   Change robot weapon to destructor beam.   Remove him. ",Classic
165643," Do you know any nice people? You know, ordinary people, not power-crazed nutters trying to take over the galaxy? ",Classic
43209, He's alive. ,Classic
129084, How do I know you're telling the truth? ,Classic
19960, I'm nobody of any importance. I'm just someone from the future. ,Classic
129528," Goodness, that's going back a bit. ",Classic
83203, I don't think you've met Rebec. ,Classic
129357," That's a resonant stroboscope, isn't it. ",Classic
105813, Ah. And so you came down here and wrecked the telegraph. ,Classic
50499," Why do you think they're wasting their time, Balan? ",Classic
57903, It might just as well be a thousand miles. ,Classic
161954, If a little odd. ,Classic
108055," I felt completely different, as though I'd never really been alive until then. ",Classic
134626, An induction loop! So that's how he generated the time contour. Don't you see what this means? ,Classic
65435, Splendid! This man can be of use to us. Give him everything he needs. ,Classic
125237," You eat with us sometimes. I've seen you give my father wine. My mother, my family. ",Classic
55948," Hmm? Well, the machine was eighty percent tellurium, Zoe, and tellurium is soluble in sulphuric acid. ",Classic
101211, So? ,Classic
117375, Which section of Atrios is this? I don't recognise any of it. ,Classic
27606, We must go. We must obey. ,Classic
69579," You can't leave Earth without that, can you. ",Classic
120257," Seems to suit the Lady Adrasta well enough, though. ",Classic
114654, K9! ,Classic
39223," No, but he is watched. ",Classic
117857," Affirmative, master. ",Classic
18073, We've got to make that sure they do. ,Classic
149380, How come you know the Rani? ,Classic
74765, Is she all right? ,Classic
137571, We girls are perfectly capable ,Classic
17717, The tide came in. ,Classic
32125, I obey. ,Classic
67231, So not everything runs parallel. ,Classic
106839, All of it? ,Classic
66183, Must I remind you once again that I am Assistant Director of this project? You will address me in the correct manner. ,Classic
83592, I know. I know all that. But it gives you a chance. It gives you all something to hope for. I wish the others were here and then we could tell them about it. ,Classic
157159, Cowardly Cutlets. ,Classic
20075," Well, I don't really see how I can oblige him if I have a prisoner. I mean, there will come a day of reckoning, of course, but, well, for the moment, pick up your sword! Now, I suppose I shall have to drive you like a Grecian cur into the city, won't I? Excuse me a moment. Farewell, Achilles! For today, Paris of Troy has other business! Come, dog!   Oh, yes.",Classic
79824, Contact. ,Classic
7135," Yes, and now they're coming back, with what orders? To take over our minds? Hmm? Or to kill us? ",Classic
146576," When he arrives, have him escorted to his laboratory with the Earthlings. I will see him there. ",Classic

119796," Yes, that's his real name. If we don't stop him, the entire human race will cease to exist instantly. ",Classic
129623," What nonsense, the pair of you. I have eliminated the concept of opposition. ",Classic
111743," Listen, this is a hit-and-run business. One bite and away. If you stick around and give the mark time to think, you're kaput. All you'll collect is a big ball and chain around the ankle. ",Classic
131556, They've been here. We found yet another power pack. ,Classic
45532, Found a couple of youngsters loose in the tunnel. ,Classic
69407, Hang about.   Main gate here. I've got a big provisions lorry. Do I let it in? ,Classic

24307," Very well then, if only they'll listen. ",Classic
152108," What a kill Davros would be, master. ",Classic
17737, What are we going to do with this fellow? What can we do with this man? He's utterly irresponsible. He wants to destroy the whole pattern of world history. ,Classic
96493, Huh? ,Classic
152143, Our engineers have thought of everything. ,Classic
129947, What did you do to the monopticon? ,Classic

154081," Well, there have been many companions, but only one me. ",Classic
148534," How, by eating rocks? Kill him! Execute them! ",Classic
106688," No, no, we must find out what happened. We must restore them to their full size and interrogate them. ",Classic
152967," Oh, yes. ",Classic
53048, What's the matter? Don't you like it? ,Classic
119457," Yes. As I said, I see your point.   No, no, it's all right, all right. Come on now. Smile. You can do it. There you are.   There we are. Here we are, look.   Isn't that nice? Isn't that nice?   Dear Leo. Sorry to have missed you. Hope you're well. Sorry about the mess on the panels. Just paint over, there's a good chap. See you earlier. Love, the Doctor. ",Classic
27540, This is an order. Bring out the strangers. I know they are there. ,Classic
146880, What are you two talking about? ,Classic
22385, Unimportant. ,Classic
90617," Arak. Tuar. Your attack was a success, then? ",Classic
56663," Well, there aren't many, but they're deadly. ",Classic
128960, We must. We have to think of Adric too. I know so little about telebiogenesis. If only there were some books here. ,Classic
150947," Let this be a further lesson. I will not tolerate any attempt to interfere with my plans. Furthermore, may I remind you that I'm working for the benefit of all Karfelons. That is all. ",Classic
101788, You're making Goth into a hero? ,Classic
73256," I am very sorry, gentlemen, but I have rather more important things on my mind at the moment. If you'll excuse me. ",Classic
109088, I said they're smashing us to piece ,Classic
83689," Throughout history, you Thals have always been known as one of the most peace loving peoples in the galaxy. ",Classic

148835, On Earth? ,Classic
65219, Then why doesn't he tell us? ,Classic
26255," Well, it sure is because you know come mornin' they're gonna ship him outta there. ",Classic
162025, You're sure you want to go in? ,Classic
58047," Oh no, you don't. ",Classic
28736, I understand. ,Classic
71453, I still can't understand how we got away with it. ,Classic
61099, I shall lead the way.  ,Classic
162993, It felt like something hit us. This could be rough. ,Classic
129616, What's that got to do with it? ,Classic
30844," Now, listen. I am warning you. If that rocket doesn't take off for Mondas, if my son's life is in jeopardy because of him, I'll take the law into my own hands. And that goes for you too, Doctor Barclay. You'd just better make a good job of that launch. Okay, start the countdown. ",Classic
94006, Better he should not at this time. The Cybermen may be monitoring our radio frequencies. ,Classic
112103," Well, let's see, shall we?",Classic
47621, But it's only a bit of seaweed. ,Classic
129854," Of course, your Majesty. ",Classic
53416, Really? ,Classic
160088," I said shut up! You've betrayed the Doctor, you betrayed me. I trusted you. I even liked you, and all you ",Classic
140255, Does it matter? You'll not be there to greet me. ,Classic
161265, D�j� vu? ,Classic
85161, Links by landline are complete. Radio links are now being established. It is only a matter of minutes. ,Classic
112090, How far do these stretch? ,Classic

90772, How can I prove my point? ,Classic
160429, Patrol! ,Classic
128901, We'll never get up there. ,Classic
54936," There's no time for explanations! As I say, one of your people has been ",Classic
124366," Yes, they've not been very clever, have they, unlike us. ",Classic
107502," Move, man! Why don't you move? ",Classic
162117, That's beside the point. ,Classic
158462," We did it, Doctor! Free! ",Classic
158095," Attention, incoming craft. You're approach ",Classic

104773, Why were you waiting at the theatre? Answer me. Why? ,Classic
54764," Oh, but I ",Classic
143600, Can we give them any supporting fire? ,Classic
13148," Now look here, young lady, lets settle this. Insinuating that all this is my fault. Hmm? My fault. ",Classic
47350," Oh, well. ",Classic
24373, Thank you father.,Classic
85363, Particularly when I realise you must have written it when you were five years old. ,Classic
88419, What were you trying to do? ,Classic
57565," She's backing off, sir. ",Classic
85655, To prevent your interference with the affairs of Earth. Don't you realise the harm that you'll cause? ,Classic
8394, I know. I've been trying to tell you. ,Classic
91203," Well, naturally, I mean, the rest were all foreigners. ",Classic
34050, You'll forgive me. I'm a little lost. The crust of the Earth is more than a hundred miles thick. Below that is believed to be a white-hot molten core. Now where is your ocean going to go? ,Classic
150212, How is he? ,Classic
63746," A ticket collector remembers someone who might have been Masters. Said he looked very ill. Anyway, he got a taxi and drove off. ",Classic
132222, Smutty? ,Classic
163027," I am Morgaine, the sun killer. Dominator of the thirteen worlds and Battle Queen of the S'Rax. What say you? ",Classic
129701," No, no, no, no. As Percy over there said, they can't be far. ",Classic
158418, I can't hear anything. ,Classic
71108, We're in a middle of a power breakdown. Jo said that you might be able to fix it. ,Classic
1611," Come on, Ian. Come on. ",Classic
109462, Crushers. Naia said something about crushers. ,Classic
156483, It was your fault. ,Classic
140159," Father, the dungeon is empty. ",Classic
14383," There is a jest here, albeit a grim one with our friends dead. But Saladin must be just as much out of temper over this affair as we are. ",Classic
128719," The temperature will start coming down fairly quickly, but without that stimulus my neuropeptide level will fall to normal. ",Classic
154690," Oh, Peri? Ah, quite unsuitable. Female. Silly, flibbertigibbet. Hopeless. ",Classic
69650," Well done, Miss Grant. Greyhound to Windmill three four two. Come in to land. I say again, come in to land. ",Classic
73967," Doctor, will you help us? It's our only hope. ",Classic
128160, An error in the dimension subroutine. Somewhere here. I will not be beaten. I simply will not be beaten. But I could certainly do with a little more help from outside. ,Classic
62734, He deserves all he gets. No sense at all. ,Classic
10423, Well then why do we go on just sitting here? ,Classic
44672, What did you want to see him about? ,Classic
83704," Doctor, I've asked Jo to come back to Skaro with me. Would you have any objections? ",Classic
79552, I've got to find out what's going on out there. ,Classic
21690, I sincerely hope there's not been any further bungling? ,Classic
48769, Yes. What caused the defence mechanism of the Tardis to register danger then? And where's the crew? And what's this track? There's plenty of air in there. Let's try and get in. ,Classic
154692," I think I'll do that. Yet, Doctor, you seem uneasy. ",Classic
125651, Shush. ,Classic
148515, But there's only three of us. ,Classic
78245," It, it looks dead. ",Classic
5177, There's a cave on the mountain where I store my traps. I found the two girls hiding there. ,Classic

119542, Scaroth. ,Classic
107723," I am gratified, your Honour. ",Classic
148270," That's what we've come to fix. Isn't that right, Peri? ",Classic
28558, He escaped. ,Classic
22045," No, I must find Sara. ",Classic
21689, Magnetised beam activated. ,Classic
38288, What are you getting at? ,Classic
68508," I wonder what she's complaining of this time? Yes, good afternoon, Captain Chin Lee. What can I do for you? Yes, I see. No, don't touch anything. I'll be over at once. ",Classic
101404," Oh, do you think so? ",Classic
52964," You can go, Packer. ",Classic
84273, Get a hold of this pole. Take it over that side. ,Classic
98302," Five minutes, Solon. You've got five minutes. ",Classic
93483, Sarah! I can hardly believe it. ,Classic
57678," All right, this way. ",Classic
108596," Yes, but the Palace is guarded by his Inner Retinue. ",Classic
108985, How long does the effect last? ,Classic
42000," Take care of him, Sapan. ",Classic
68402," In other words, you don't know. ",Classic
158536," Well, you see, the beam casts a shadow at the base of the Tardis. Now, if we could tunnel under the cone and come up in that shadow, then perhaps I could disarm it. ",Classic
86793," I don't suppose you remember, Minister, but we met briefly at UNIT. ",Classic
111625," I've already said that a close effort might be considered, Highness. Perhaps when I've shown you something of the planet? ",Classic
3042," My caravan is large, Yeng, so I shall need plenty of food and water before venturing out into the Gobi Desert.   Is the accommodation to your liking, Ping-Cho?",Classic
121896, They'll get away! ,Classic
97645, How can I refuse? ,Classic
127541," Well then, perhaps we could apply the ultimate sanction. ",Classic
6972, I can smell something burning. ,Classic
157115, Leave her for the cleaners. ,Classic
146191, An extraterrestrial kidnap? ,Classic
125113, Good! ,Classic
91247," I agree, but how? ",Classic
157429, No Exit's not here. ,Classic
3323, No sign of Tegana. ,Classic
162607," Quiet, Ace. I'm working. ",Classic
152958, What went wrong? That old hag took our guns away from us just like that. How can we be their prisoners? ,Classic
126216, Ponder on what? ,Classic
88106, Then what is your explanation? ,Classic
14054," Parasite? A power, absorbing territory, riches, energy. culture! You come to me.  ",Classic
33970, I shall decide that later. ,Classic
80535, And here. That should do it. Yes. ,Classic
14241, Today it is. But what am I to say of you to the heathen? How can I explain you to them? ,Classic
110690, There aren't enough of us to capture the Citadel. Not if Castellan and his guards are working for the invaders. They all have stasers. ,Classic
32375, Then we will strike. ,Classic
25289," I think I'm turning to ice, Steven. ",Classic
150019, What? ,Classic
22217," Pretty soon, my dear, pretty soon. ",Classic
62622, Twenty eight over two. ,Classic
20115," Here, Diomede! Come on, step lively now! ",Classic
125765, So they were all destroyed? ,Classic
109076," We're going on, K9. ",Classic
47192," Yes, movement. Don't ask me what it was. ",Classic
26712," I reckon so, and I'll tell 'em. Where will I say? ",Classic
82294," Doctor, are you sure? We don't really know if it's the police. ",Classic
93096, We are not lying. ,Classic
113313," We are impregnable. The Mentiads are powerless. The guards will pick them off at will. Captain, is Calufrax now entirely rendered? ",Classic
10331," All right, let me go first. ",Classic
50638, By scientific. ,Classic
54530," So far, so good, sir. Over. ",Classic
67654, A few inches? ,Classic
76256,   A mutt? On my Skybase? How? ,Classic

50840, Leave that boy alone! ,Classic
113849, She will come. ,Classic
41189, Well? ,Classic
21015," How is it the intruders knew that the taranium was here and that it was to be handed over, if they did not come from the Solar System? None of the others knew what was that Representative Mavic Chen was bringing here. ",Classic
9549," He's dead, Barbara. I killed him. ",Classic
104838," By jiminy, you're right! We'll teach those blighters a lesson yet. They picked the wrong man when they decided to cross swords with me. ",Classic
70823, The primitives attacked you as well? ,Classic
43034," Don't be a fool, Storr. Of course it's not the drugs. ",Classic
65303, Capsule drifting on course. No rectification needed. ,Classic
121522, Root? ,Classic
124967, We were within our rights. ,Classic

104822, Poor creatures. They can't be a day over sixteen. ,Classic
125509," A few. But most of them, no. Yesterday they took our son. ",Classic
118108, Is that all? ,Classic
82920," How. That's a very good question. How. Well, there must something here that could prove useful. ",Classic
133448, We will take the bridge at once. Continue the reactivation. ,Classic
60877," We must carry out the Doctor's plan, that's the best way we can help him. ",Classic
128723," Oh, the architectural configuration system can do more than that. We can actually delete rooms. ",Classic
128892," He says he doesn't know who he is, or why he has come. ",Classic
51253," There you are, you see? All right. It's all right! ",Classic

86913, We shall have to do something about this. She'll be a disruptive influence. ,Classic

73254," Thirty five-ish, average build. He was wearing a sort of guerilla combat suit. ",Classic
54081,   That's all we need. If he carrying on shouting like that we'll have every Cyberman in the area on top of us. ,Classic

152132, They're like a double act. ,Classic
103387, All readings are eighty five percent above safety. ,Classic

125665, We'll know that when we find it. ,Classic
146257, Why should I be made to suffer? ,Classic
65348," We shall have to find him first, sir. ",Classic
131607, What does that stuff taste like? ,Classic
115081, I can't say I'm wildly surprised. ,Classic
76259," I should think so. What happened to your security arrangements? And why wasn't I informed that Varan was here? Really, Marshal, on the eve of the independence conference.",Classic
119278, I don't know. ,Classic
103967," It's a floater, all right. You've got it, guv.   On my oath, you wouldn't want that served with onions. Never seen anything like it in all my puff. Oh, make an 'orse sick, that would. ",Classic

164027," So, here you are at last. Haven't I been kept waiting long enough? ",Classic
61263," But the personnel in the landing bay are not aware of my arrest. When the security guards return from the Time Zones, you won't stand a chance. I can stop the arrival of the time machines. ",Classic
139833, Planet Earth. ,Classic
31297," Now, you want to watch you don't take this Examiner stuff a bit too far. ",Classic
37896, Fifty thousand! ,Classic

73436,"   I see, sir. ",Classic
98765, I don't think this has been disturbed. ,Classic
51099," It was just a bit bumpy. Oh now then, the main thing is we weren't spotted. Now come along, we've got to find Zoe and the others. ",Classic
1777, No. The Daleks took it from me when they searched me. It must be down there somewhere. In the city. ,Classic
144510," But a remarkably well-informed guess, sir. ",Classic

89295, What?,Classic
103973, What happened to the others? ,Classic
47383, She's telling the truth. The door was locked from the outside. ,Classic
82598," That is my property, I believe. ",Classic
153672, What's happened? ,Classic
133949, Crew of the freighter safely returned to their own time. ,Classic
9242," Not Jules Renan, by any chance? ",Classic
51748," Well there is an emergency unit, but, oh no, I can't possibly use that. ",Classic
78310," Well, what did they do? ",Classic
141974, Then align the manipulator to the computer. ,Classic
9529, Tell me what I must do. ,Classic
85906," Then let us hear your counsel, Doctor. So far you have served us well. ",Classic
85563," Aye, aye. ",Classic
64820," The same result, a little earlier. ",Classic
144240," I'm not here as your prisoner, Davros, but your executioner. ",Classic
90083, The police? ,Classic

132748, What's the matter? ,Classic
136576, Yes. ,Classic
61788," Reckon if I know where to find one of them things, it'd be worth a tidy old bit, eh? ",Classic
97538," Could you spare a minute, please? ",Classic
75304," Don't speak to me like that. I shall have a full enquiry into the whole thing. Meanwhile, consider yourself under arrest. Take him to my office immediately. ",Classic
100288," Well, only if I guess wrong, and then it's fatal. ",Classic
7237," In a man of thirty, Doctor? And he looks so old. Why have the Sensorites done this? What do they want from us? ",Classic
43619," The instruments on the ice face have the highest heat and shock resistance known to man. When they cease to function, everything about them will be destroyed. ",Classic
105549," That means it keeps out of sight while it spies out the land, hoping to mount a successful attack. ",Classic
36089, Why are you back? ,Classic
110244, Resistance is useless. The Vardans have more power than we have dreamed of and more knowledge than we can hope for. You must submit the way I did when I first met them. ,Classic
32800," Well, there must be something we can do? ",Classic
21492, But ,Classic
142689," Yes, good idea. ",Classic
132462, A cold collation? ,Classic
3477, Let's get started. ,Classic
116828," Master, radiation levels indicate nuclear warfare in progress on planet surface. ",Classic

61687," What do you mean, not human blood? I took it from the patient myself. ",Classic
149139, I never have. ,Classic
161527," We have but one left, my lady. I doubt that our arrows can stop these weapons anyway. ",Classic
136898, I'm afraid we have no choice if we're to have any hope of saving Tegan. ,Classic
114629," Well it is to me, your Honour, yes. What is this female humanoid called? ",Classic
143364," No, no, no, stay back.   Please, there are far too many of them. ",Classic

133182, Full power. ,Classic
121333," You know what, Dymond? The Empress has eaten your ship. Ha ha! Eaten it. ",Classic
150608, Proper clothes? ,Classic
134476," Go back, Tegan, or you will destroy me. ",Classic
44479," Tell the Captain to inform me the moment he's found her, and to hurry. ",Classic
17513," Yes, Father? ",Classic
163093, Where? ,Classic
18581, I was outnumbered. ,Classic
159531," Yes, they're following me. ",Classic
45079, What is this Tardis? ,Classic
68088," And what about you, Captain Yates? ",Classic
127884," I just wondered how you came to be here. There is only the road, after all. ",Classic
135493, Do precisely as you have been instructed. To the controls. ,Classic
76573, Your people? ,Classic
111369," Yes, I suppose it must be for someone as young and inexperienced as you are. ",Classic
92449, Start starboard four. ,Classic
3601," They are harmless, Tegana. ",Classic
132289, Not a Worcestershire Talbot. ,Classic
147577," Not anymore, you don't. In precisely twenty seconds, you and it will cease to exist. ",Classic
149382, But he's an exiled Time Lord. ,Classic
87728," You've got an idea, haven't you? ",Classic
163826, Yes. The finest example I've seen this side of the Stone Age.,Classic
157642, Hungry. Hungry. Hungry. Hungry. ,Classic
87134," Well, they caught him red-handed. ",Classic
67961," Asphyxiation, heart failure, shock. ",Classic
18822," I learnt it at school. There's nothing you can tell me about nature, simply nothing. ",Classic
85097, And you say he was delirious? ,Classic
112999, A gestalt. A telepathic gestalt! ,Classic
7201, Yes. ,Classic
80212, Only another two chapters. ,Classic
103797," Come on. Hold this, D84, and don't press anything. ",Classic
142407, That's right. ,Classic
164072," No self-control, these Mediterraneans. Too excitable. Nasty tempers, too. ",Classic
108881," Yes, sir. ",Classic
27167, She wouldn't go that way. It's not allowed. ,Classic
62086, Meteorites? Don't know about that. Thunderballs I calls them. ,Classic
33624," No, he just disappeared. I wonder where he went to. ",Classic
71124, Such as what? ,Classic
98058,   Morbius. ,Classic
125342," Oh, I see. That problem again. ",Classic
50116, Return to the Operations room. Destroy the force field after they let you through. ,Classic
78319," All right, lads, it's a bomb! Dive! ",Classic
118531," One for casual, one for best. ",Classic
90398," No. No! No, I will not!   No! No, I will not! No! ",Classic
136458, Toys for children. ,Classic
37299, I might just be able to help you. I can't tell you anything at the moment but later I'd like you to meet a friend of mine. I'm sure he'll know what's best. ,Classic
67092," Right, sir.",Classic
68010," Charming little chap, isn't he. Where did you get it? ",Classic
27994," Doctor, do you think we'll ever see him again? ",Classic
139589, Of course. ,Classic
130561, We thought you might be hungry. ,Classic
64130," Control to Recovery 7, do you read me? ",Classic
94679, Listen. ,Classic
17009," Quick, lift up your arms. ",Classic
144198, Quickly. Come on. ,Classic
45383," Well, he was certainly a brave soldier. There's no doubt about that. He gave his life for his country, and I was proud to serve under him. Is that all right? ",Classic
60725, Did you recover the machine? ,Classic
149030," Take him through, Josh. ",Classic
26868," I'm sorry, Doc. I was only trying to help. ",Classic
8895," No, they'll come this way. They always do. Are you ready? ",Classic
81966, You. What are you doing here? ,Classic
32510, The cables they laid. The trick I tried before won't work anymore. ,Classic
149655, What's it do? ,Classic
17271," Well, I'm tired. ",Classic
99106," I don't care. I must know what happens when a Krynoid touches human flesh.     What do you do for an encore, Doctor? ",Classic
17661, So you plan to save him the journey? ,Classic
13834," Well, there's one good thing. At least that spearhead'll make it easier for us to get out here. ",Classic
132977, Shut up! Do you recognise any of them? ,Classic
109603," Hurry, they're coming. ",Classic
162610, What's that noise? ,Classic
98370, You really can't go on calling yourself Morbius. There's very little of Morbius left. Why don't you think of another name? Potpourri would be appropriate. ,Classic
59044, Aye. ,Classic
82565," Jo, I presume that the Tardis is still here? ",Classic
13749," Now the question is how to make it safe, hmm? ",Classic
75939," All right, Captain Hart, get these two out of here. ",Classic
29377," Ben, perhaps the murderer was hiding down here all the time. ",Classic
149383, Exactly. Two of a kind. Odd. Very odd. ,Classic
137540," We've all seen the Doctor regenerate before, and it seems without the presence of other life forms, he could die. ",Classic
158382, Halt! ,Classic
116130, I told you not to exaggerate.   Who's that? ,Classic
126322, Not many answers. ,Classic
136544," Look at this, Chela. ",Classic
25618," Mine. Ah, that's better. Six. One, two   three, four, five, six. Do I get a second turn for a six? ",Classic
75612," Oh, I'm so sorry. ",Classic
145982," Jek, how is she? ",Classic
112177, Do you think you could find your way from here? ,Classic
73189," Well, it's a very complicated thing, time, Jo. Once you've begun tampering with it, the oddest things start happening. ",Classic
77689," Ah, I see. Therefore ",Classic
64489, Triggered off by our speech. ,Classic
161406," Well, the Cybermen might find the Tardis. This way, our validium leads us to their validium. ",Classic
34635, What's that? ,Classic
101535," The trial was adjourned, master. He pleaded Article Seventeen. ",Classic
141555," All right, I believe you're not hostile. ",Classic
89042," I fear your people will have little choice, your Majesty. ",Classic
35468," I thought so. You see, it's simple. Nail varnish remover dissolves nail varnish. Nail varnish is a plastic. So we do what Jamie says. We sprinkle them, see? ",Classic
165476, Lucky? ,Classic
77385," So, you've managed to wriggle out of trouble, have you? ",Classic
41164," No, but there has been.   ",Classic
125962," Oh yes, you are all right. You haven't done so much better yourself. You stow away in our Tardis, you expect us to",Classic
59368," Sir! Accused, one pace forward, march. ",Classic
156920," I'm sure, were he able, he'd express his appreciation of such unstinting confidence. As soon as the activity indicator reaches eight point one five, increase the stimulation. ",Classic
16283, Look! ,Classic
2478, I was thinking. ,Classic
65289, That doesn't matter. I've got a few ideas of my own. ,Classic
129742, Bring the children to me. ,Classic
10771," Well, he was waiting for me! That means that we'll have to change the storehouse. ",Classic
142440, We must prevent the reenactment. Spoil it in any way we can. Reduce the amount of psychic energy being produced. ,Classic
8406, Are there more of you? ,Classic
9393, So what do you want with me? ,Classic
127669, Starting with my quarters. I'll join you in a minute. There's something I want to look into.   Help! Nyssa! ,Classic
106702," Another mistake, and a costly one, Time Lord, because now, thanks to your dimensional stabiliser, I am no longer forced to exist in the micro world to breed and multiply. My Swarm, when it is hatched on Titan, will no longer be invisible microbes prey to all, but mighty and invulnerable creatures, invincible. The age of man is over, Doctor. The age of the virus has begun. ",Classic
117781," Come on, Theet. Class of ninety two? ",Classic
9892, Which one? ,Classic
10488, No. ,Classic
27479," You mean they put him in that glass cell? Steven, what are we going to do? ",Classic
50243," Yes, I'd almost forgotten that. ",Classic
120837," And how do you propose to do this yanking, Doctor? ",Classic
148098," That's interesting, not to say arresting. ",Classic
69911, Sir? ,Classic
20174," Nonsense! The catapult is, well, you could make one for yourself out of strips of ox hide, and secure both ends, and then stretch it out like a bow-string. ",Classic
24096," Yes, you do my dear. Now you take care of them because you never know when we might use them. Now, I suggest we take a last look round and we'll get you off to bed. ",Classic
155348, Send a stretcher party to the lounge. ,Classic
149052," You underestimate me. Certainly I want to destroy him, see him suffer, but that is just an exquisite first step. I have a greater concept, one that will encompass the whole human race. ",Classic
40715," Okay, Doctor! ",Classic
81803, The proof you need is in the minds of those two traitors. We shall have to use the mind probe. ,Classic
34529," It doesn't seem possible, does it? ",Classic
64759," Get in, Miss Shaw.",Classic
24221, It's a substance called gragarium rock. It'll last for ever. Here's the finished design.   ,Classic
27650, You heard what Chal said! I shall call him back!   Has he hurt you? ,Classic
84537, Yes? ,Classic
32689," Get away with you, woman. ",Classic
19141, The verdict has been given.   Well? ,Classic
25091," No, they will lose one game, and then, like the clowns, they'll become my toys, and we shall be able to amuse ourselves through all eternity. ",Classic
157770," As in, forbidden to all residents of Paradise Towers on pain of death. ",Classic
1152, You and your companions need a drug to stay alive. ,Classic
161000," Ah, not quite. I can hear the sound of empires toppling. ",Classic
130440," Go on, choose. ",Classic
13953," Where does it draw its power from, hmm? ",Classic
160026, Have you busted it? ,Classic
82208," It is true, your Majesty. I did come here as a prisoner, but I came willingly, in order to warn you that this man is plotting a war between Earth and Draconia. ",Classic
81700, Very well. ,Classic
134305," You she thinks too clearly, my child. ",Classic
77996," It's all right. It's all right, honestly. It's a difficult thing to",Classic
154753," Don't worry, you'll see plenty of action. ",Classic
21277, There are forty billion people in the Solar System. Doesn't that provide some scope for error? ,Classic
40566, Certainly. And this time on our terms.   I wish to speak to the Controller. I wish to speak to the Controller!,Classic
98532, Where are the others? ,Classic
1168," As you say yourself, all your lives depend on it. ",Classic
85507," Well done, old girl. Absolutely on target. For once. ",Classic
87123, Never mind your instructions. ,Classic
51698, Where is it? ,Classic
164020, Take him to the upper observatory. ,Classic
59379," Oh, but none of that's true. You've twisted the whole thing. ",Classic
80677, These Tellurians are not even from our home galaxy. There is no way of telling what diseases they may have brought with them. ,Classic
73301," Yes, it started to work. Oh, I see, yes. Yes, the temporal feedback circuit has overloaded. ",Classic
16979," Well, I don't like it. ",Classic
67810," Just what do you think you're doing down there, Miss Grant?",Classic
24633, I bring you news. ,Classic
105431," In the sea, sir. Came floating in as I was tying up. What the sea can do to a man. ",Classic
67180, Is there one? ,Classic
137368," In fact, I'm very heartened that you felt able to confide in me like this. I must say it's a most remarkable story. ",Classic
153809, To distract me. ,Classic
35671, He's ,Classic
126012," We are outnumbered. Unless you aid us, we shall all be killed. ",Classic
59464," General Smythe, the prisoners have ",Classic
23581," Your Majesty, there is enough money in France to finance the war. ",Classic
95696, ,Classic
44336," Oh yes. Yes, I'll come back. ",Classic
54039," They took a van and went back to London, sir. ",Classic
18350," Yes, a revelation, a revelation. ",Classic
118777," Now, this bit here and this bit here. Good.   Now, let's see if the Doctor's right. ",Classic
14503," I am, yes, sire. I am well-known for my proper dealings. ",Classic
9925, How could we? You've never explained it to us. ,Classic
89780, Nothing. He can't last much longer. He must be almost out of fuel.,Classic
76565," With that man's help, I could the whole atmosphere regeneration project operational within a week. ",Classic
79482," Yes, as quiet as a lamb. We've got it thoroughly subdued, haven't we, Sergeant. ",Classic
129190, The Doctor and Shardovan climb through the window onto a small balcony at the top of a flight of stairs.) ,Classic
155911," By me, madam. ",Classic
79285," Look, is he really you? ",Classic
109756, Why did you call him Jason? ,Classic
85952," The brain can still receive signals, Professor. It might work. ",Classic
63222," Well, the Silurians are reptilian, you see. They've presumably created an environment inside there that suits them. ",Classic
76793," If the torches last, and they don't attack. ",Classic
103636, Taren Capel could. ,Classic
141047," Ah, there you are at last, dear fellow. What kept you? ",Classic
51533," Oh Jamie, it's not as simple as that, is it? If only I could get hold of that atomic seed device, I might be able to defuse it. ",Classic
80954, Come on. ,Classic
3308," No. No, while we can we'll push on towards the oasis. ",Classic
35530," Let's think. Benzene, ether, alcohol, acetone and epoxy-propane.",Classic
79911," No, no. I was just explaining to my associate here that he should show you more respect, for both our sakes. ",Classic
34869, What? Oh aye.,Classic
43817," Yes, I suppose so. Then you can judge for yourself.     You remember Michael Assevski? He was Controller of the Eastern European Zone. He was drowned at sea a mile from shore.   Hockingham, murdered. All of them were seen with Salamander, or a man known as his deputy, shortly before their deaths. ",Classic
76009," Oh, I see. ",Classic
57581," Yes, sir. ",Classic
78434," Oh, come on, really. ",Classic
126060," There, that should do it.   There, that should do it. Well, Kalmar, there's all the knowledge you'll need in there. Use it well, and if that's what you want, you can be a high technological society in no time. ",Classic
57920, You think he's in league with them? ,Classic
91283," Oh, I say. This isn't gallant. ",Classic
88529," My dear chap, you're just not listening, are you. No one's admitting anything. But if you'll take my advice, you'll try and get on the right side of Gebek. Without him, you've got a full scale revolution on your hands. ",Classic
142450, This door must give soon. ,Classic
51018, You can count me in. Kando? ,Classic
31061," I'm not asking you. Can it be shifted, Doctor Barclay? ",Classic
73348, Feeding the troops. ,Classic
41487," Hey, Doctor! ",Classic
71187, Receiving you. ,Classic
83576," That's about it. Right, let's go and help the others with the barricade.",Classic
65885," Some sort of retrogression of the body cells, I think. ",Classic
45897, None. ,Classic
82873, Doctor. ,Classic
100063," The most learned men of all Italy. Scholars, artists, men of the new sciences. ",Classic
139118," Everything except that jewel.   That isn't contemporary. Seventeenth century Spanish, isn't it?",Classic
133961," Now listen to me, both of you. There are some rules that cannot be broken even with the Tardis. Don't ever ask me to do anything like that again. You must accept that Adric is dead. His life wasn't wasted. He died trying to save others, just like his brother, Varsh. You know, Adric had a choice. This is the way he wanted it. ",Classic
26492," Oh, give it here. I'll do the pouring. You sure got the shakes real bad. ",Classic
102341, But it gets faster too. The rope gets thinner the further it goes ,Classic
135012, What does that mean? ,Classic
63081, Some kind of a ball. It's got some markings on it. Have a look.,Classic
118101, Sire. Sire. I have failed. The Doctor has accomplished his purpose. He has the Key to Time. I have failed. ,Classic
63756, I want to know what happened to that man. Corporal! ,Classic
118632," The Doctor, he needs help. Where did you get that picture? How do you know about Davros? ",Classic
25326," We've won! There's the Tardis! As soon as the Doctor wins his game, we can go! We're safe! Oh, no, it can't be. It's got to be the real one. Look! It's happened again. ",Classic
115469," She had, but I knew Your Majesty couldn't live without her, so I brought her back for you. ",Classic
36697, All right! ,Classic
25522," Look, you still believe in these creations of the Toymaker, don't you? You can't see that they're just phantoms, things created in his mind. ",Classic
84409, My head. Help me. ,Classic
57295," Well, I locked him in the room that we were trapped in. ",Classic
153516, You turn this. ,Classic
61005," No, he arrived by chance. ",Classic
91308," Go! Go now, or I will destroy you all!   ",Classic
79148, No. I shouldn't go anywhere near it. Not just at the moment. ,Classic
27001," We're only the city guard, of course. They don't ask our opinion, do they? ",Classic
103545," Yes, this is the place. ",Classic
143823, There is a time factor. The space station transmitted a distress call. ,Classic
32740, We'll be caught like rats in a trap. Can we not run for it? ,Classic
88004, We've come quite a way without any tests. Perhaps we're safe now? ,Classic
107035," Oh, gently, Mrs T, gently. Remember your varicose veins. ",Classic
30194," Okay, go ahead. Should be about 4-2-0. ",Classic
144942, You see? He appears at the Doctor's command. ,Classic
48426," Well, where's the helicopter then? ",Classic
98075," From the sacred Flame, you have been granted the gift of eternal life. Cherish and serve the flame, my sisters.   Only you five will now survive, Ohica. ",Classic
97613, Harry! ,Classic
14671," My mother, my brother and my sister Maimuna disappeared last year. My father searches everywhere for them. We live in hope they will return one day. ",Classic
2806," Yes, we can all relax. We're quite safe now. But it was a narrow squeak. ",Classic
164063," Snap out of it, Nimrod. If I didn't know better I'd say this was deliberate. Ten minutes was all it took to wake up the more sophisticated, civilised, police inspector. ",Classic
105438, What beast? ,Classic
137085, You realise that car was unique? ,Classic
52738, Shouldn't we get out of here? ,Classic
77592, Five nine and steady. ,Classic
120342, Metallic ores. The pure metal itself. ,Classic
113694, What was obvious? ,Classic
134319," Tegan's right. Look, she'll be perfectly all right. As soon as she's free, you both go back to the Concorde. ",Classic
8295," Well, are there any other buildings in the vicinity?  1 ",Classic
93311," Excellent, excellent. ",Classic
78927, And you were responsible for his death! ,Classic
60987, The same way you all came here. But first we've got to defeat the people that run everything. They have a stronghold. ,Classic
8998," Now according to the sun's position, we were travelling south. ",Classic
116695, I was so worried. They told me your ward had been hit. ,Classic
74447," Give me a chance to explain, Hepesh. ",Classic
160343, You look rather unhappy about something. ,Classic
156922, Is this what you're looking for? ,Classic
34311," And clothing. Super. Thanks, Ara. Look at this! Listen, why are you doing all this for us? ",Classic
12386, One of them is. They sell the produce of the gardens to the townsfolk here. Very cheaply too. They must be fools. ,Classic
164796, More horrible than the Well of Hvergelmir. ,Classic
135875," Well, there's no other way. ",Classic
152095," I know. As in any paradise, my dear Orcini, there is always a serpent. ",Classic
25196," Oh, no no no, don't fuss yourself, m'dear. The point of the game is to see who picks the chair which isn't dangerous, and whoever does that is the winner. If it's you, you'll get your Tardis back, and if it is us, we get our liberty. ",Classic
84794," Oh really, Doctor. As far as I can gather from your computer record at UNIT, the difficult thing is to stop you talking. No, no, no, you won't provoke me so easily. ",Classic
22720," Fellow delegates. Even as you sit here, the great war force assembled under the Daleks, is awaiting the final order to set out and conquer the universe! ",Classic
150424," And I was right. Whatever he's done to her mind, her nature will stay exactly the same, and Androgums have as much emotional capacity as, as a gumblejack. ",Classic
2035," It's a good job we haven't been over-eating recently. It's going to be a long crawl. Well, we won't use one of the customs of your planet. ",Classic
97484, It would suit our purposes better if no one was warned. ,Classic
1445, That's it. Dodgems. ,Classic
154877, You're using Yrcanos as an assassin. ,Classic
43267, It isn't enough. ,Classic
99781, What school of philosophy is that? ,Classic
138384, Perhaps you're developing the Lazar disease. ,Classic
50006, Because there's something on board that rocket that we've got to have if we're going to beat the Cybermen. ,Classic
134453, Are you responsible for the abduction of my passengers and crew? ,Classic
107072," What? Yes. Yes, I suppose it is. ",Classic
3155, Two or three hours. I'll call you then.,Classic
120189," Stop it, you fool! So, the little metal animal knows everything. Well, well. That makes both the Doctor and you redundant, doesn't it. ",Classic
68500," Oh, put it through, will you? ",Classic
54935, Answer me. Where are you from? ,Classic
145631, She has been taken from me! ,Classic
4560, Grandfather! ,Classic
61409," Oh, now what can we do? ",Classic
109347," Yes. With this, here. ",Classic
17613, Good day ,Classic
33364, Or what? ,Classic
68076, Mmm? ,Classic
85132, We're going ahead then? ,Classic
26360, Don't look that way to me. Not from where I'm standing. ,Classic
124286, The Screens of Zolfa-Thura. ,Classic
83323, Report. ,Classic
13368," Saved your life. You were about to have a wash in there, weren't you, or probably drink some of it? We very nearly had the remnants of a Coal Hill School teacher in there instead of his wretched old, ragged old tie. ",Classic
154601," You are a great dog of war. I mean, a great warrior, whose advice I trust and value. Oh, very well. Today prudence shall be our watchword. Tomorrow I shall soak the land in blood. Come with me! ",Classic
94387," Look, I've done everything I can to help. I set up the transmat, I directed the Cybermen. You might never have found Voga if it hadn't been for me. ",Classic
83698, What about them? ,Classic
77164," I am, Jaeger, I am. But we shall need the beam to transfer the effect from this laboratory to the contaminated areas. ",Classic
110349, Until she gets to outer Gallifrey. ,Classic
143572, Oh? The Captain normally allows new arrivals to settle in before subjecting them to the tedium of Officer of the Watch. What did you do? ,Classic
45025," Maybe, but that's where Salamander is. ",Classic
163867, Too right. ,Classic
101924, Are you suggesting he survived? ,Classic
111783, What are the Graff's wishes? ,Classic
105911, The glorious Rutan army is making a series of strategic withdrawals to selected strong points. ,Classic

104640," Elementary, my dear Litefoot. He came in the laundry basket and let the others in. ",Classic
116398, Look! ,Classic
85250, But that's us. ,Classic
98052, No!   ,Classic
104908," Well, I thought I ought to tell you anyway, in case I let the side down. ",Classic
92993," Please, Harry, don't be difficult. ",Classic
25429," You didn't ought to have of said that, Cook. ",Classic
10481," Well, we must try again. ",Classic
153359," Why was it not burned, Drathro? ",Classic
120844, I know I'm right. Well? ,Classic
115311, Lamia's offered us a deal. ,Classic
156845, If you say so. Lanisha! ,Classic
21030, Prepare pursuit ships. Stand by Randomiser.,Classic
62811," Oh, Captain Hawkins? ",Classic
53918, Proceed. ,Classic
11446, Are you Ashton? ,Classic
121059," Doctor, this is the milk run. Station nine to Azure, Azure to Station nine. A straight charter for the whole season. ",Classic
48723, No. ,Classic
51202, Command accepted. ,Classic
13553, Yes. Do you think that kid'll be all right out there? ,Classic
61943," I left my car down at the main entrance. They won't go crashing about with guns or anything like that, will they? ",Classic
104371, Right. ,Classic
117794, Armaments? ,Classic
156068," What is your interest in this matter? Not, I think, concern for the Doctor. ",Classic
1654," Yes, yes, I know, but let me talk to them. ",Classic
110476," Yes, sir. I have checked all the bio-data extracts personally. ",Classic
105608," Nothing, my dear. Absolutely nothing is happening here. ",Classic
47679, My wife is ill. She needs medical attention. ,Classic
50189," Hello, Earth Central. This is Captain Ryan, acting controller of Station Three. ",Classic
43604," Well, Penley? ",Classic
13127," Well, I'll travel some of the way with you, and it's home for me. They won't catch me a second time, I promise you that. Come. Come. ",Classic
4952," No, no. It must have fallen on you from the trees. ",Classic
58615," Yes, all right, but hurry, Doctor. ",Classic
130598," Oh, very well. ",Classic
37450," Well, he's nowhere to be found. ",Classic
42579, I'll tell you how to get there. ,Classic
156648, I know where I can get some. ,Classic
27917, That is correct. ,Classic
52488," No, the Doctor's made up his mind. He's going to see the Master. ",Classic
152833," You know, I might stay here a couple of years and write a thesis about that. Come along.   Peri?",Classic
151992, As you wish. Why do I allow myself to get involved in such lunatic situations? ,Classic
89136," No. No, no. Whatever he knows, we still need him. ",Classic
125535, Surely you realise something here must be wrong? ,Classic
116063," Kroll! Kroll! Great Kroll!   Kroll, Kroll, spare thy true servants.   Kroll rose from the deep to protect his people. Let us give thanks to Kroll! ",Classic
24913, It's changed again. There I am in Paris. ,Classic
132911, Positive. ,Classic
110423, How much have you told me? ,Classic
140455," We've landed.   According to the instruments, we're nowhere, in no time. ",Classic
146173," Doctor, stop it! ",Classic
13494," They will. They can echo their signals to us off satellite Taron. Menop spearhead, acknowledge reception. ",Classic
77277, Yes. ,Classic
34310," Ah, food. ",Classic
136913, I will tell you when. ,Classic
564, There are marks here. ,Classic
126416, There's a way out through here. ,Classic
142180, No more than you are. ,Classic
150733," Please, take care of my beautiful moths. ",Classic
161689," The rockets are now locked in to a destination. Now, let's see how the Cyberfleet is progressing.   Right on course. ",Classic
47163, I can assure you. I was only being curious. ,Classic
117478," Oh, yes. Mentalis is convinced it's invincible. It's been programmed not to accept defeat. ",Classic
113964, No. ,Classic
159197," I think he means it, Doctor. ",Classic
84838, The fool. What did he want to bring them in for? Doesn't he realise that bombing'll never stop those maggots? ,Classic
472," Grandfather, I knew you'd think of something. ",Classic
106065, All I'm saying is that I want a real ,Classic
66741," Please, no! No, no! No, no, no, no, no! ",Classic
98925," Unlike you, I can hardly bear to look at it, considering the cost. ",Classic
49530, Is there anything you want? ,Classic
133562," Yes, Leader. We are able to break through them. ",Classic
119532, Scaroth. ,Classic
12714, Psst. Psst. ,Classic
87623," I think they'll go for it. Mind you, they haven't much choice, but I must warn you again. Don't you trust them an inch. ",Classic
160649, Back! Weapons. ,Classic
100963, What were those planes doing? They were bombing the complex. ,Classic
146924, It's reacted to the heat of the laser. ,Classic
116129, Seize them. ,Classic
118851," Oh, it's not important. Even if he got away, he can't do much on his own. ",Classic
140928, It's a bomb. ,Classic
34658, And no reserves? ,Classic
152062, Let me do it. ,Classic
107768, Breathable atmosphere. That's wrong. ,Classic
67425," Yes, I'm sure you did, but, even so. ",Classic
137636, I'm not in the army. I'm not taking orders from him. ,Classic
100714," No, I'd rather you stayed here with me, Doctor. Driscoll is familiar with the systems and you've been in once. You never know. ",Classic
21512," When the fugitives are captured, report at once. ",Classic
146272," You say that too easily. I've saved you once. Five ships destroyed, but there may be others. You have betrayed your presence on Titan Three. ",Classic
24946, Who was that man? ,Classic
131233, I had that in my mind? ,Classic
46140," Come on, Travers, let's fix up this detonator. ",Classic
33173," Oh, you can hardly breathe. ",Classic
55234," Thara, is that you? ",Classic
57845," Yes, we know all about that. We have your identity registration here. ",Classic
17863," Oh, it doesn't take much to put you off. A sweet little thing like that? ",Classic
139143," You had no right to do it. They're real. Living, breathing flesh and blood. ",Classic
87918, Hmm? ,Classic
53409," This strange Doctor's been on another planet, Packer. ",Classic
39621," I'm trying to puzzle out a problem, Victoria. The Daleks say I'm going to do something for them. Something I would rather die than do. ",Classic
127189," It's here. It's just been displaced slightly by the current time cone. Now, what's the simplest way around this? I'd like to set up a standing wave. Something the autosystems can home in on. ",Classic
33841, Would you disturb the dead. ,Classic
129956," Oh, Doctor, thank you. ",Classic
152748," Oh, great. ",Classic
86616," Doctor, suppose this gadget of yours doesn't work? ",Classic
61777, Where do you think you're going? ,Classic
75015, What's that noise? ,Classic
53660," Oh! You don't think we're going up that, do you? ",Classic
107909," Show courtesy to my rank, or I'll cut your skin off inch by inch. ",Classic
116556," Hey? Is that your considered opinion? You know something, Romana? I think that if we   Romana! ",Classic
50160, I've got a head like a big bass drum. Somebody's going to pay for this. ,Classic
115563, I shall deal with the King myself. ,Classic
11357, What about you? ,Classic
157690," Just when Paradise Towers was being completed, before any of us got here, he disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Never been seen since anywhere. ",Classic
32668," It's got words on it. With Charles our brave and merciful Prince Royal, we'll greatly fall or nobly save our country. ",Classic
116591, There's something blocking the firing bay. ,Classic
6554, She has broken the law. It must be reported to Tlotoxl. ,Classic
99803, The Mandragora Helix has come home to roost. ,Classic
107603," Jack, give me the gun. ",Classic
110459, Yes. A jelly baby. My right hand pocket. ,Classic
934, But Grandfather says that it's impossible for anyone to live out there. ,Classic
97362," Nothing so crude as fission weapons. The androids will disseminate a virus. It will cause a contagion so lethal the Earth will be rid of its human population within three weeks. Then it will burn itself out, and the world will be ours. ",Classic
162989, It would seem so. ,Classic
13519, You lie. You are the Menoptra. Our detectors show you are massing in space to attack. Speak! ,Classic
113472," The Captain's trophy room. Well, what do you think? ",Classic
19680, Do you realise whom you are addressing? ,Classic
11742, Speak! ,Classic
51516, But why? What do they want? ,Classic
84901," Ah, I expect they want to stay near home, sir. Lie close to their breeding ground? ",Classic
124232, Shut up. And what's happened? Nothing. It's a catastrophe. You've failed.   The Dodecahedron! ,Classic
30170," Well, just take a peek at that. ",Classic
62789," That's typical of the military mind, isn't it? Present them with a new problem, and they start shooting at it. ",Classic
105102," Ah, now that's an oil vapour system. That's a different thing altogether. They're going back to that as they reckon as how that's cheaper, see. ",Classic
153027, It's my ration for the next two days.,Classic
80839, The Tellurians will try to escape. ,Classic
113509," I shall be free from you, you hag. ",Classic
45323," Oh, I understand. I buy the Yeti off you thirty years ago, and now it is valuable. You try to scare me, take your Yeti back. Why? Money! You want to rob me. ",Classic
102404, Where? ,Classic
22716, The Daleks have assured us that they will recapture the core of the time destructor. ,Classic
124781," Well, I have a very reliable eyewitness, and then when I went to the scene of the crime ",Classic
27296, I am looking after this wretched fellow. ,Classic
79889, Where are we going? ,Classic
83011, Like a volcano? ,Classic
86064, Eh? ,Classic
24923, You! I might have guessed. ,Classic
40169," No. Not just yet awhile, no. But you and Jamie can go back to the Tardis if you wish. ",Classic
164076," Those shabby old things? Why, the Doctor had me lay out this for you. Well, will it do, my dear? ",Classic
80436," Doctor, do we have to stay here? Can't we just leave? ",Classic
156530," Yes, of course. ",Classic
38347, Why? ,Classic
97936," What a waste. What a stupid, senseless waste. ",Classic
151143, You can't just revoke an intergalactic treaty. ,Classic
38259, I'd better say goodbye. ,Classic
114464," Well, bodies of dead creatures. Dead travellers, I suppose. ",Classic
145420," Yes, of course. The man must be a genius in his way. ",Classic
35567," Yes. Yes, it's all right. ",Classic
84821, Shush! I nearly had a fit when I saw you. ,Classic
110005," Yes. Rites I must observe, things to do, things not to do. ",Classic
74917," Ah, don't worry. I keep my eye on him. There you are, my dear. Come along now then. ",Classic
158667," But it's my livelihood.   Doctor, you've got to help me. ",Classic
25167," Oh, they seem to be playing with dolls, my dear. ",Classic
1703, It can't be the Daleks. They told us they couldn't come out of the city. ,Classic
157844, It's taking over the building floor by floor. ,Classic
57482," Aye, well, it took long enough to work, eh? ",Classic
41415, Then she must still be in the monastery. ,Classic
9380, Doctor? ,Classic
100147, If he didn't return. ,Classic
164540, If you'll just follow me. ,Classic
57471, Earth will still die. The fungus will take the oxygen from your atmosphere. ,Classic
47251, So? ,Classic
85294," The ship is in need of repair. Even if it were not, you would destroy yourself should you tamper with it. ",Classic
159126, It's here. ,Classic
119927, Your commander says this is yours. ,Classic
95693, Through the window. ,Classic
157451, Read out what it says. ,Classic
88875, Why? ,Classic
131156, Is that what affected the lights? ,Classic
67165, Delirious. ,Classic
115903, Kroll! Kroll! Kroll! Kroll! Kroll! Kroll! Kroll! Kroll! ,Classic
102984, Yes. ,Classic
9512," LeMaitre, LeMaitre. Why can't you use your own initiative, my man? ",Classic
119685," Discretion and charm. I couldn't live without it, especially in matters concerning the Count. ",Classic
77763," But shoved it through where, for goodness sake? ",Classic
59275," Er, look, Major, we don't want to trouble you. If you'd just let us go on our way. ",Classic
4803, And what of the one that has escaped? ,Classic
149651, I'll believe that when I see it. ,Classic
113282, What about the real you? That wizened old body in the time dams back there. ,Classic
14909, He's dead. ,Classic
68130," Excuse me, Jo. ",Classic
107792," Magnificent view, isn't it. How high is this building? ",Classic
32919," Oh, no. Just a wee bruise or two and a lot of dirt. Now we're both trapped. ",Classic
144906," Hmm? Er, I don't know yet. Someone's been interfering with the Tardis navigational system. Kamelion. It's been remote-paralleled with the Master's Tardis. So that's how he followed us to Sarn. ",Classic
32237, She's in league with the Daleks! ,Classic
93964, What is it? ,Classic
86101, Irongron's castle is to be destroyed by sorcery? Then all is well. ,Classic
71600," Yes, of course I am. But I'd like to find out why the Master came to this planet. ",Classic
85001, Shush. It's all right. ,Classic
96433," Huh? What's the matter? For goodness sakes, old chap, don't you recognise me? ",Classic
41793, Intelligence. Formless in space. I astral travelled. ,Classic
96511," Yes, of course we do! ",Classic
55217, They use these machines to plant impressions on the mind. That's how they've enslaved these people all these years. ,Classic
106997, Doctor? Doctor! ,Classic
135050, He's stuck on Xeraphas? ,Classic
138613, Nyssa! You came through the cure. ,Classic
105730," You've no right to say such things, Colonel. Lord Palmerdale has always been the kindest and most considerate of employers. ",Classic
153206, My instructions were to maintain an underground survival system. ,Classic
107122, I will give the orders around here. Take him away. Lock him up somewhere. ,Classic
127240," Forgive me, but I serve a greater purpose. ",Classic
35147," What are you going to do, Doctor? ",Classic
145073, How does it feel to get a taste of your own medicine? ,Classic
43397, You'd better take them to the Medi-Control Centre. Get someone to look at the boy. Make sure there's a guard for when they come to. ,Classic
165050, Correct.   ,Classic
106127, Yes. A parrot's a bird that repeats things. Move over. ,Classic
24175," There you see, complete with chills. ",Classic
75446, Er ,Classic
98492," No answer. You are concerned about the fate of the blue whale, and the natterjack toad, but the loveliest, most defenceless part of creation, the great kingdom of plant life receives no protection at all. ",Classic
144129, Get on with it. I can do without your pity. ,Classic
39401, What is that box for? ,Classic
128989," Remarkable, isn't it? ",Classic
46430, So my party will get above ground and approach Covent Garden by Neal Street. Is that clear? ,Classic
121401," Yes, Vrax. The Doctor is probably a narcotics agent, so we are all under suspicion. So I thought perhaps that we might put our own house in order, as it were. ",Classic
107570, Yes. ,Classic
8495, What about the Second Elder?  1 ,Classic
61491," I'll do my best, but I can't promise anything. Jamie, Zoe, hide your eyes. Run! ",Classic
46403," Yes, yes, of course. ",Classic
9095," Yes. Yes. What? Oh, of course. Yes, yes, of course, of course. Well, I'll take up no more of your time, citizen. ",Classic
124363," Stay there! If he tries anything, kill him. ",Classic
91046, But there's nothing that could do that. Dynastreem's indestructible. ,Classic
81342, They're carrying a cargo of bulk flour.   Doctor? ,Classic
116708, Zeos is there all right. ,Classic
49287, Good. Good. ,Classic
97390," I said, you and I are going into that rocket! ",Classic
93455, The Daleks are in position. They will act on your command. ,Classic
90782," Hello. Come to see me off, have you? Well, I hate goodbyes. I'll just slip away quietly. ",Classic
80769," Yes, I did. I managed to persuade the High Council of the Time Lords they were an offence against the dignity of sentient lifeforms. ",Classic
143325, I'm going back. Someone should be with her. ,Classic
156616," Well, you said you admired all his writings, read all his books. ",Classic
109609, Destroy him! ,Classic
75345," Nevertheless, we need to work very fast from now on. Trenchard, I need your fullest cooperation. Tell me, where is the Doctor? ",Classic
4836," That is your responsibility. As soon as it is light, a thorough search must be made. If you fail, you will be killed. She must be found. ",Classic
79244," Yes, I am, but perhaps he can help himself. Show me the Doctor's time stream, the section for his earlier self before he changed his form. ",Classic
7361, The Sensorites only spoke to me through my ,Classic
101050," Hey, look. No signs of life. ",Classic
98358, Correct. ,Classic
69145," Well, aren't we? ",Classic
122900, Halt. Shush. ,Classic
27395, You are interested in our work? ,Classic
79322, Oh dear. ,Classic
62785," Liz, this time I think he's right. ",Classic
129767, Or slaves. ,Classic
148016, That was a repeat. ,Classic
93797, I'll give you what time I can. ,Classic
121780, Then Tryst and Dymond are the smugglers? ,Classic
120553, I take back what I said about this being your lucky day. ,Classic
81574, And then what? ,Classic
124586, Decider! Decider Draith! ,Classic
33108," Well, don't just stand there. Get me out of this infernal hole.",Classic
153008, Husbands? Plural? ,Classic
162878, The Czech engineering group. Flood relief in the low countries. They can be at the site by tomorrow. ,Classic
25708, And then you have won completely. ,Classic
137882," Well then, surely he can do the same for Nyssa and Tegan. ",Classic
120801, I'm afraid you have only twenty four hours to live. ,Classic
121854," It means, Fisk, that we can finally clear this marauding menagerie back into the projection, which is exactly where Dymond will want it. ",Classic
118396, Obey. ,Classic
44394," Mmm. Delicious.   Ah, very good. Where's the salt? ",Classic
123428," They prefer a low profile. Bluntly, it's either them or bankruptcy. ",Classic
162666," Close.   What we need is something to help us.   Wait a minute. Ah yes, of course! I never thought I'd need these again.   This should remove a few obstacles. ",Classic
67667, The box! I had to open it! There was a voice. ,Classic
13113, But how did you know I'd get in that way? ,Classic
140228, Here is one not escaped. ,Classic
25686," Well, do we have a chance to escape? ",Classic
9956," Yes it is, isn't it. ",Classic
101847, Then the people rejoiced ,Classic
89995, From Earth? But how? Did you come in a starship like your ancestors did? ,Classic
2970, I am in my sixteenth year.,Classic
21678," Yes, but suppose ",Classic
94014," Right, then we'll have to check every section. Come on. ",Classic
65420," Yes, they killed Jim. Jim Daniels, fellow astronaut, simply by touching him. ",Classic
160362, Yes. Where are your badges? ,Classic
131912, Your friends are of no interest to me. ,Classic
93604, Gharman? ,Classic
28774, Right. ,Classic
116368, Are you sure? ,Classic
143725," Sorry, Doctor. Look! ",Classic
161702," Give us the bow, Doctor. ",Classic
71973," Goodnight, Frank. ",Classic
67298," The data from the computer isn't conclusive, Doctor, nor is Stahlman's behaviour. We have no proof of an emergency situation. ",Classic
117408," Well, of course. We traded with them. ",Classic
62531, There's your answer. ,Classic
28163," Oh, it's just a knack, you know. Anytime you want a bit of brightness in your life, come to Pol. Mind you, he's a special case. ",Classic
49600," Up and about again, eh? That's better. I've done the tour, Gemma. Everything's running like clockwork. ",Classic
93746, What's taking him so long? ,Classic
102361," An eternity. I'm turning off the boundary to let in my pets from beyond. Goodbye, Doctor. ",Classic
107957," It hasn't been used, so it's not on the computer records. ",Classic
100163, How did he die? ,Classic
653, Yes. ,Classic
103240, Concentrating. Whatever's locked can always be unlocked. It's just a matter of thinking out the right combination. ,Classic
96254, Where? Where have we landed? ,Classic
120053, Engineers. Doran and Tollund. ,Classic
26357," Very well, under protest. ",Classic
89280, I've got a space shuttle hidden on the other side of the mountain. Her Majesty here is going to be my safe conduct. ,Classic
93327, She's tired. She needs rest. ,Classic
47498, What are you doing in here? Is there something that you want? ,Classic
113," Well, use a match. ",Classic
35324, I don't care what I said. ,Classic
52119, Oh my feet ache. I'm going to sit down and have a rest. ,Classic
13613, I can kill you all. ,Classic
3239," In future, the guards will be told to notify me immediately if any of you wish to leave the camp. Now go and change. We have to break camp soon. ",Classic
79151, The drains? ,Classic
69435," Sorry, sir. He seems to have got away. ",Classic
84714, Thank you. ,Classic
122668, Invasion. ,Classic
129132, This noise is not acceptable. ,Classic
33750," Well to Jamie, its 1746. Robert Burns wasn't born until 1759. ",Classic
40829, What is it? ,Classic
54284, But you still haven't told us what that will do. ,Classic
18288," Doctor, we'll never get past those sentries. ",Classic
156064," So you've said, but can you prove that? ",Classic
101151, Traitor! I gave them life! ,Classic
37805," Yes, indeed. You won't escape again. ",Classic
99819, So what was going on back there in the temple? ,Classic
144166, I must do my duty. ,Classic
105171, How'd you get here? ,Classic
22854, Why should we rejoin them? ,Classic
111584, We give thanks. ,Classic
90020," He did, but surely there's a ",Classic
67151,"   Hello. Get me Control. Yes, I can hear the alarms. Now this is Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart. Now get me Control!   Hello, Control? Lethbridge Stewart here. Now, what's happening? Yes. Yes, yes, yes, go on! How serious? ",Classic
7038," No, no, I don't. I think it was an exercise in fear and power. ",Classic
114446, Hmm. ,Classic
57284," Zoe! Jamie! If you're there, let me in!   Oh no! ",Classic
1699," Oh, yes. ",Classic
49010, I dare say. But I don't understand the analogy. We're both in space. It's you and your friend who aren't conforming to custom. ,Classic
72818," What's the matter with you, Benton? I want to speak to the Doctor. Over.",Classic
12354," Didius, the slaves we've already brought from Gaul are in no condition for further travel, and the quality is such we shall have to take far below the market price as it is. ",Classic
58984, Thank goodness for that. For a moment I thought you'd had it. ,Classic
102426, Standing in my own throat is. ,Classic
160335, How quickly? ,Classic
153451, Then what will happen to us? ,Classic
164325, Mama! ,Classic
30159," Yes, sir! ",Classic
22999," Dust! It's all crumbling into dust.   Sara!   Come on, Doctor. ",Classic
36258," Yes, but he ",Classic
157961, So be it.,Classic
262,   In his hands. We are not going to the wood. ,Classic
105437, Do you think the beast ate him? ,Classic
116279, Probably doesn't need to move much. We were just trying to decide what it'd look like out of the water. ,Classic
144223, Could this be the Doctor? ,Classic
31099, Is that wise? ,Classic
152059," We must multiply. The seed of the Daleks must be supreme. We must conquer and destroy all those who resist the power of the Daleks. Kill me, child! ",Classic
44722," No, Swann. We must check the power levels, huh?  ",Classic
2689," It went off again, Grandfather. ",Classic
133604, Shall we call them? ,Classic
57102," Doctor, do you know there's been a alien here? ",Classic
79407, What's happening? ,Classic
101701, He's one of the Chancellor's personal guard. ,Classic
4850, So I'm to become one of your slaves? ,Classic
100826," Driscoll's in the core, probably vapourised. You see, it's feeding on radiation and it's now in control of the core's potential itself. ",Classic
48750, It looks like the motor section of some sort of rocket. ,Classic
156190," Yes. Yes, of course it's me. Where are you? ",Classic
10517, We're going to take you back to the ship. ,Classic
114186," Oh, shut up, K9. It's all to do with interspatial geometry. ",Classic
129102, Doctor? ,Classic
121454," Names and dates of birth. Come on, come on. ",Classic
131134," Will you shut up.   Of course, it's all your fault. ",Classic
141519," Now listen, and listen carefully. You have a choice. Cooperate, tell us all you know, and you'll be treated honourably. ",Classic
95620," Hmm? Well, this is clearly the base for some kind of scientific expedition, possibly geological. Something went wrong and they sent out a distress signal. ",Classic
22075," Now, come along. We must go back to the Tardis. This is a madhouse. It's all full of Arabs. Come along. ",Classic
136993, A friend. ,Classic
163912, Door must open. ,Classic
19884, I think you had better tell him. ,Classic
23083, The wine is two sous. I cannot change this. ,Classic
72746, I shall consider. Now leave. ,Classic
114549," The question is, did you or did you not remove the seals from the official compartment in which my colleague and I were travelling? ",Classic
99141, Turn around. ,Classic
115950, Why else would the Sons of Earth send us weapons. ,Classic
165140, I can't stay. ,Classic
63476, Never mind. ,Classic
133111," Ah, got it. The release mechanism. You'd better get back too. ",Classic
79804, Our race. ,Classic
43019," These warriors are not of our time, nor of this planet. ",Classic
2474, Everything's in a mess. ,Classic
160843, Which further go on to say that an alternative execution may be substituted. ,Classic
147750," That, Mister Lytton, is why two men are dead. ",Classic
104068, Where are we going? ,Classic
46071, I wonder how the Intelligence managed that? ,Classic
154176, Die!   Rombrom ssssssss sabaluma. ,Classic
158288, Good. But they'll be one short. ,Classic
50658," No. At least, not at first. ",Classic
8463, Perhaps they're really allies of the Sensorites. ,Classic
66336," Well then, he'll have to lump it, won't he? There's no alternative. ",Classic
34823," Oh aye, Doctor, I am now. You know I never thought I'd say this, but, well it's great. ",Classic
97638, Come on.,Classic
107203, 'Tis true. They're investigators. They come to investigate. ,Classic
93688," They've all been rounded up. We're winning, Gharman. We're winning. ",Classic
15927, Shh! ,Classic
43105," Jamie? Jamie is alive? Oh, is he all right? ",Classic
10362, Are you sure they have gone? ,Classic
66815," That's enough. Don't waste it! That's enough, I said! It's Stahlman! ",Classic
134044, We were supposed to be going to the Great Exhibition. ,Classic
98182, Hair pretty. ,Classic
135111, The navigational system? That must be faulty. We never seem to arrive where we intend. ,Classic
123960, Close down receptor panels until further notice. ,Classic
71095," Yes, and one that I shall have great pleasure in bringing before the proper authorities. You say there's some sort of procedure? ",Classic
9987," Yes, well, it's natural behaviour for an ant when it's attacked. Take the eggs to safety. The worker ant'd give his life rather than abandon the eggs, you know. ",Classic
54400," Let me worry about that. For the moment, I have the Cybermen exactly where I want them. ",Classic
427, Make fire. Make fire come from your fingers as I saw you. ,Classic
111790," I have no time, nor have you. ",Classic
113129, He said release me. ,Classic
66903, By what possible right can you ,Classic
161077, A place where there is no love. ,Classic
62568," This technician, was he badly hurt? ",Classic
29041," We miss you, matey. But most of all does the Captain. ",Classic
146565," A porter from the Royal Hatcheries, master. ",Classic
50938, Then you will report the fact to me. No personal action. Toba! ,Classic
20831, We obey! ,Classic
92764, The female of the species. ,Classic
35194, What's that? ,Classic
5128, Thank you. ,Classic
71927," Get up! All of you, get up! Caldwell, come over here. ",Classic
17650," I'm sure you'll approve, Doctor. ",Classic
73942," There were accusations, counter-accusations, and then the wars began. That was the turning point. ",Classic
113486, Which would require astronomic energy sources. ,Classic
152850," It's in the wrong part of space for it to be your planet. Besides, according to all the record books, this is Ravalox. ",Classic
7561, I'm glad to have left those silent people. ,Classic
23898," Well, you've been out in the curfew before, haven't you? ",Classic
42499, How long was I in the ice? ,Classic
79340, Look. ,Classic
32102, Perhaps we should have dealt with the Examiner earlier. ,Classic
77437, I can't! It's overloading! ,Classic
86562, He says there's some kind of an emergency. He must see you. ,Classic
153028, Give it to him. ,Classic
135191, You sort it out. I want to sleep. ,Classic
27662," Oh, yes. It is the way we leave when they have taken our strength away. ",Classic
163048, I understand. ,Classic
17673, Can't you even guard one old man? ,Classic
75469," Well, Trenchard. I think that you handled Captain Hart exceedingly well. ",Classic
134646," Look in the sarcophagus, Professor. ",Classic
49657," Yes, it's your training. I shouldn't worry about it. ",Classic
103527, I heard a cry. ,Classic
127982, Now!   That's odd. There's no pressure on those doors at all. ,Classic
127632," I used to know an ancient remedy for mad dogs. I must look it up some time. Good library here, have you? ",Classic
79684, I don't think you'll get through with that thing. ,Classic
17545," Yes, well, it usually does. ",Classic
69607, Trap One to missile control. Report my signal. Over.,Classic
49722," We're going hunting, Jamie. ",Classic
85349, Oh. Seems to be a lot of them about today. ,Classic
23925," If one Huguenot life escapes me tomorrow, we may both regret this act of mercy. ",Classic
352," Yes, it has. But it's impossible to accept. I know I'm here ",Classic
41458," Get down, Doctor!",Classic
87880, Then they almost certainly visited Earth and taught the people there how to build. ,Classic
71178, Steady. ,Classic
34682, You don't know the password either! ,Classic
131204, It retreats back to where it came from. ,Classic
143318, I'm sure we can pick up the trail again. I'll trust your judgement. ,Classic
87479, There we are. ,Classic
88473," Hurry, alien. Must I prove that I mean what I say? ",Classic
141297, Listen to me. Don't throw your whole career away because you don't feel quite ready. That's silly. Lieutenant Michaels' replacement arrives the day after tomorrow. There may not be a missile run before then anyway. ,Classic
130895, Silence. To the dome. I shall return. ,Classic
58080," Oh Doctor, he's coming round. ",Classic
137210, Yes. ,Classic
164830, Russians. ,Classic
94556, Cybermen. ,Classic
127975, This is too much! ,Classic
82515," I've no idea, but whatever it is, it's on our side.",Classic
29919, Avery's curse. You can have that for the sharks. ,Classic
116240," It's even more unpleasant to experience. Ranquin, what was the secret of Kroll's power? ",Classic
129490, Yes. ,Classic
47637," Yes, so did I. We better make the most of it. We've got a lot of work to do back at the Tardis. She seems to be sleeping peacefully. Come on. ",Classic
32518, You've done all this. Why'd you give them power in the first place? ,Classic
110788," There is no advantage in killing, yet. Slavery is more efficient.",Classic
41619, You cannot allow? These are the orders of our Master. You must obey. ,Classic
65190, You came up here in Recovery 7 but you never made the journey back. Something happened. ,Classic
128281, Then come into the streets and see what's happening. ,Classic
6789," Yet we may help each other. Although I have lost my faith in our traditions, I keep my faith in you. ",Classic
95174," Cyborg is a hybrid creature, Brigadier. Half animal, half machine. Must be very interesting. ",Classic
98005, Well?   Well? ,Classic
142737, It sounds dangerous. ,Classic
137837, Without the Tardis? ,Classic
3645, If only we could find out. If only we could prove that Tegana had seen the Cave of Five Hundred Eyes before. ,Classic
47384, Mister Robson. ,Classic
53090, But what's so odd about people going into the building? ,Classic
109510, The guards and slaves are the only people of true Minyan descent. We have evolved far beyond them. ,Classic
128683, Event One. ,Classic
124275, Approaching Zolfa-Thura. ,Classic
107728, Bishop to queen six. Mistress! ,Classic
163592, He's gone to dust. ,Classic
119779," Duggan, we are where I promised we'd be. Four hundred million years back in Earth history. ",Classic
118712, Excellent. Now I wish to concentrate. Leave me. ,Classic
142185," Hmm, so I'd noticed. ",Classic
81174, One gathers the intention is the escape of these Drashigs in order to cause a disaster that will reflect badly upon President Zarb and his regime. ,Classic
91439,   What? ,Classic
165210, I had him shot. ,Classic
24431, You mean? ,Classic
101840, Early history is something of a pet subject. ,Classic
70470," What's happened, Bill? Why has it suddenly stopped? ",Classic
155706, Okay. ,Classic
46443," Now you'd better stand back, Anne. ",Classic
21437, I think I heard someone.  [Station corridor,Classic
3049," May I have a look, please?",Classic
78499, Do you think that I haven't thought of that too? You're as trapped as I am. You couldn't even open that door of yours unless I wish it. ,Classic
94067, I've never seen anything like this before. His temperature's just shooting up and up. ,Classic
103050, Sometimes you talk like a Tesh. ,Classic
135302, The Doctor tried to evade security. Some force had to be used. He'll be brought here as soon as he's recovered. ,Classic
8638, Why not? ,Classic
44204, Poison?,Classic
89142," Now, Ambassador, you must be a lot brighter than you look. How come you're so well informed? ",Classic
17120, Who? ,Classic
33515, Got it!   Here we are. Look at the seal. ,Classic
98618, Okay. ,Classic
154738, He has given me drugs to stabilise my condition and keep me alert. Can you smell fish? ,Classic
92010, Ever heard of the Eumenes? ,Classic
71957," What is it? Well, er, it's, er, it's a sort of antique really, but it does have great sentimental value. Will you excuse us? ",Classic
126507, I don't like the sound of that. ,Classic
85108," Yes, I think so. ",Classic
38654, Here we are. That's funny. There were a couple of other gentlemen here. They seem to have disappeared.,Classic
94482," Stand aside, I say. ",Classic
120213," Ooo, a bit rash, wasn't it? ",Classic
27737, You fool! ,Classic
33832," What is it, Doctor? ",Classic
56768, What are these things?   They look like seed pods. ,Classic
29342," Sounds dishonest, Captain. ",Classic
103388, She's going!   ,Classic
72441," It was this fellow, Garvin, who did him over? ",Classic
109142, Full speed! ,Classic
144919, You said that once before. ,Classic
74448, Take him before the King. ,Classic
3646, It won't make much difference soon. ,Classic
77982," Oh lor, I'm forgetting my patient. See you, Sergeant. ",Classic
24308," They'll probably ask you to speak next, Doctor. ",Classic
116917, Is that your last word? ,Classic
117825," No. Not yet, anyway. I dunno, I've got tunnels all over the place, but I can't seem to find it. ",Classic
87178, He's probably on his way here now. But he needn't worry us. The countdown is too close. ,Classic
95017, I'm still waiting for that liaison report. You're still in touch with the Coastguards? ,Classic
125676, Shush. ,Classic
23641," You have done well, my son. Father, you may leave us. I will settle this matter. ",Classic
137233, I think I saw someone move. ,Classic
120637, What I just said. ,Classic
117839," Oh, come on, Drax! You could have repaired that and long-dogged it out of here years ago. ",Classic
83306, Why do they need such low temperatures? ,Classic
156591, I'm overwhelmed. ,Classic
158456," Sure, if I leave my neck behind. ",Classic
78916," Greetings to you, my brothers. I grieve to see the council is so small. And yet I rejoice that you, the few who have put me here, have come to claim your just reward. Today, you shall see the Mighty One himself. Kronos, the most terrible. Krasis, the high priest will assist me. Prepare, Krasis. ",Classic
54859," Abu-Gond and Vana-Gond, alone of your generation you have been chosen to receive the highest honour that can befall a Gond. You are now the companions of the Krotons! Our warmest, our most sincere congratulations to you both. You will now step forward for the investiture of your robes of honour. Eelek. ",Classic
164476," Put it down, child. It's not a toy. ",Classic
106241, Why not me? ,Classic
116608, Hmm? ,Classic
38635, Getting the police. What?   I don't think you ought to touch anything. I'll be as quick as I can. ,Classic
34001," Bring her here.   Don't be difficult, girl, it's quite painless. Lights. ",Classic
119679," Why, yes, sir. So I've only just been told by the maid. ",Classic
24755," Yes, the Monoids won't know who's taking them. And as for me talking to them, or speaking to them, as you say, well, the problem's quite simple. ",Classic
84685, There's only one real answer. A biological counter-strike. ,Classic
163044, No hidden switches. ,Classic
158202, From someone here? ,Classic
37449," Now, come on Doctor, wait a minute. We're not certain of that yet. ",Classic
122132, He crashed the ship. ,Classic
3022," Yes, Mongol fighting Mongol. ",Classic
141079, What reward? ,Classic
94969, Better keep his recovery dark for the moment. ,Classic
18479," Oh yes, we know more than you. Your timing is wrong. The disintegration of this planet is not fourteen dawns away. It is now less than two dawns. ",Classic
156099," For example, you wish to see the proprietor. Now, the correct procedure is to make an appointment. ",Classic
103153, Halfway to two confessions. Dask knew what they were. ,Classic
94826, A man of convictions. ,Classic
74251," Chairman delegate from Earth, we are not here to indulge in social diplomacy. ",Classic
143922," No, but we're not going to wait here for the Daleks to find us, either. ",Classic
60503, We're going to return to the time zones and organise the resistance into one big army! ,Classic
91104, I could get authority to search. ,Classic
23764, Without my knowledge or consent? ,Classic
78063, Keep back! Keep back. ,Classic
141038, They're gone. ,Classic
154385," How can you be certain? You have no clear memory of the incident. And as we all know, the Matrix never lies. ",Classic
150899, Are you in pain? ,Classic
69018," Jo? Jo, where are you?",Classic
59673, All right. I'll believe you.,Classic
137393, No! ,Classic
46062," As soon as the effect of the mist was known, this whole area was cordoned off. But by the sixth, the area had expanded to include South Ken tube station. Right, carry on, Knight. ",Classic
12788," Which part of my action would you like me to put into effect first, hmm? ",Classic
162221, Don't ask. Just lets get out of here. ,Classic
135835, What's that for? ,Classic
146065," As you wish, Father. ",Classic
24205," They are stored in trays and will re-emerge normally when we land. Each cabinet contains a million people. Oh, yes. There are many things aboard our ship which would interest a traveller. ",Classic
54458," Sergeant Walters, ask Wing Commander Robbins to bring us down at the nearest airstrip to Henlow Downs Defence base. ",Classic
106829," Who's there?   Is that you, Time Lord? ",Classic
164558, What's that noise? ,Classic
73546, Yes? ,Classic
133848, It has to be. It's the only logical answer. ,Classic
87813, The other Dalek is coming this way. ,Classic
114620," Talking of the Ogri, what happened to our friend? ",Classic
92199, Stop the experiment. ,Classic
97624, The enterprising Earth girl! No! Don't move. The sensors indicated an intruder. I hardly expected to find it was you. ,Classic
136868, This should be fine. ,Classic
81409, There's no need. ,Classic
139116, All the period detail is impressively accurate. ,Classic
103322," I'm on my way.   No, you wait here. ",Classic
78179, I don't understand a word you're saying. ,Classic
151341," Admit defeat, Doctor. ",Classic
159021, I don't recall. ,Classic
36703, Everyone up. The sun is out. ,Classic
2976, I have never seen him.,Classic
122931, And the Nimons are finished. Seth defeated them. I knew he would. He's the hero of Aneth. ,Classic
89296, Come on! Come on! ,Classic
123177, Gallifrey? ,Classic
148332, That stuff. Who wants it? ,Classic
20294, Eh? ,Classic
19703," Oh yes, it's true. ",Classic
37879," We all have to help in this, Meadows. Roll up your sleeve. ",Classic
14981, What about that performance? ,Classic
28425, I resist all attempts to change me into somebody else. ,Classic
21819," Hey, now here's the Sergeant. Come on. ",Classic
88313," So, Gebek, now we have the truth of it. ",Classic
105167," No, it isn't. ",Classic
1333, Why? ,Classic
84076," What, in a place of this size? ",Classic
101188, Where's that astro-rectifier? What did you say? ,Classic
96552," Well, he's not alive now in any real sense. Only Sutekh animates him. Deprived of his outside contact, Sutekh'll be as powerless as the day Horus left him. ",Classic
86722, No one? ,Classic
107629, Pretty big. Big enough to blow this place to atoms. ,Classic
136077, Why? ,Classic
26845, Just remember what I told you. ,Classic
150696, May I say what a pleasure it has been to see two such dedicated trenchermen enjoying their food. Unfortunately the reckoning is rather high. ,Classic
36182," Doctor, this Colony was founded many centuries ago by our ancestors who came from the Earth planet, like your young friends. Our ancestors believed in the virtues of healthy happiness and we have tried to keep their ideals alive. Sometimes, alas, it is necessary to use force.   The Doctor will be returning to his quarters now. ",Classic
65805," I still can't get an answer, Professor. ",Classic
37507," I personally will investigate Chameleon Tours. Then I'll report back to you here if I've found out anything. But in the meantime, if you could just keep everything going as normal, you understand? We don't want them to get wind of anything. ",Classic
120135," Don't interrupt, dear. It's the only thing that's keeping you alive. ",Classic
137371, Sir? ,Classic
80605," Some things need to be said. Zarb disbanded the army, and now our only defence is that!   We have just demonstrated its inefficiency to those Lurman spies. ",Classic
13271," This is not merely a decorative object. Come along, come along.",Classic
33587," Well done, well done. ",Classic
92892, Trap? ,Classic
131013, Dream? ,Classic
3400," No, Susan. They were put to the sword twenty years ago by a great Mongol conqueror called Hulagu. ",Classic
127232," There we are, a fully fledged full backflow inducer. ",Classic
126432," Thought, I said. ",Classic
50945," Yes, to see if we were intelligent enough to use as slaves. ",Classic
66733, No! Don't go anywhere near him. Don't go near him. ,Classic
101505," He seemed nervous, well, apprehensive. He was looking around all the time that we were talking. Then, just before the President appeared, he turned and started to run across the Panopticon. After that, I thought he said ",Classic
42614," This is the most important job I've ever had. Now, every other project I've handled with ease. Nothing has failed. I was chosen because I never fail. When I handpicked the team, I made one vital mistake. ",Classic
158321," Truth is, there's a Bannerman war fleet on its way here. Nice and easy, folks. Don't panic! Nice and easy, nice and easy, don't panic. ",Classic
109129," Herrick, keep on! ",Classic
156879, You're probably right. ,Classic
117265, Doctor! Doctor.   ,Classic
137482, Quickly! ,Classic
69427, That's you finished. I warned you. I only need one of you.   ,Classic
7495," Oh, very well then. And how do we get down to this Sensphere? There's no air outside the ship. ",Classic
37433," Well, I'm afraid you won't believe it when you hear it. However. First, Inspector Gascoigne was murdered with a ray gun. ",Classic
50720, There is a way. Find it! ,Classic
130522, Maybe I do. ,Classic
124909, How do I know? Let's get back to the science unit. I want to put some of that spider tissue under the microscope. ,Classic
12767," Me, curious? Huh, nonsense. Someone made a mistake. He thought he was talking with somebody else, I shouldn't wonder. ",Classic
36167, Ah. ,Classic
55350," Doctor, look. There's a photoelectric cell here. It can't be working. ",Classic
37624," Aye. Doctor, it's moving towards us. ",Classic
42831, Yes. ,Classic
92833, But I helped you. I did everything you said. ,Classic
105817, You mean we've no way of contacting the mainland now? ,Classic
100851, It's intelligent. ,Classic
41993, The sanctum. ,Classic
73654," If only you would let me recruit more human security guards, I ",Classic
60904, I am trying to get the truth out of him. ,Classic
111657," May you live a long life, Graff, but not that long. ",Classic
107693, Praise the Company. ,Classic
58026, It could be coincidence. He's seen the drifting wreckage and he's curious. ,Classic
17576," Yes, and you can drop the monk's act. ",Classic
129781, Crusade? ,Classic
153695," This trial is concerned only with your actions, Doctor, and their consequences, nothing else. Wider issues, if there are any, are not within our terms of reference. ",Classic
163305, A piece of chalk? ,Classic
59085," But that's madness, Caven. There isn't time. The Space Corps will here before we're finished. ",Classic
71374, All right. Have you told him the IMC people are prisoners? ,Classic
137276, No sign of Turlough. ,Classic
100194," Quickly, men, they're needed at the west gate. ",Classic
63843, Hold them long as you can. I'm doing my level best to get you the support you need. ,Classic
97230, The invasion countdown has begun. There will be no variation in the schedule. ,Classic
17186, Just down there. I saw it as soon as I came out of the ship. ,Classic
96384, Sutekh? ,Classic
103718," They might work, Uvanov. If you could pass a positive charge through the metal plate, you'd be able to magnetise them and have anti-robot bombs. ",Classic
126763," And for you, too. Do nothing. ",Classic
153036, In so far as ,Classic
153029, What? ,Classic
156076," There's nothing purer and more unsullied, madam, than the desire for revenge. But, if you follow the metaphor, I've thrown a pebble into the water, perhaps killing two birds with one stone, and causing ripples that'll rock the High Council to its foundations. What more could a renegade wish for? ",Classic
95312, Is he? ,Classic
151057, It's called treason. And he is the traitor. ,Classic
21441, It's sealed. Open up! [Experiment control room] ,Classic
87981," Yes, I know. ",Classic
135236, I will need to confirm your authorisation. ,Classic
82503, The drive outlet circuit's gone again. ,Classic
84581, Orders? Whose orders? Not that fellow from Global Chemicals? ,Classic
30849," Give it to me. Son, Son, have you seen any sign of those spacecraft yet? ",Classic
59943," Ah, but I will use my reinforcements to turn your flank. There!",Classic
43954, Did you see the rocket take off? ,Classic
31979, Yes? ,Classic
74531, The Princess is right. Federation authorisation would be required. ,Classic
69706," My dear Mister Chinn, if I could leave, I would, if only to get away from people like you. ",Classic
67795, Certain vibrations. ,Classic
20477," Oh, that's nonsense. I mean how could she have? ",Classic
112677, Master. ,Classic
58067, And he refused. ,Classic
30410, Because they can't last another orbit. ,Classic
4890, I hope everything won't be as bad as this place. ,Classic
98057," I, Morbius, lied? ",Classic
63823, Thank you. ,Classic
107196," Well, I had to warn you. ",Classic
6364, I did as he commanded. ,Classic
75974," You know it'll work, with your cooperation. All the equipment we need is here. ",Classic
32870," Just in time, Perkins. Just in time.",Classic
148153," Soon, your death will be apparent. You will see. Should we try again to reach agreement before I must communicate with my executive council? ",Classic
117705, What's that? ,Classic
55322, They seem to have a way of transferring mental power to pure energy. ,Classic
52448," The strip? Oh, a strip cartoon of the year two thousand? ",Classic
43597, I daren't. ,Classic
22605, Have you enough men? ,Classic
79282,  It's a song by the Beatles. ,Classic
60986, How? ,Classic
121481, Now what do we do? ,Classic
123425, This isn't a Foamasi government document. ,Classic
84032," Yes, well, we haven't got any cutting equipment, you see? I mean, the mine's been out of action a year. But I know where we can get some.",Classic
109935," In what style, sir? ",Classic
23263," She, I remember. She was sent to the house of Admiral de Coligny. ",Classic
111238, What is this place? ,Classic
114350, I did. I feared for your safety. ,Classic
16510," Well, Vicki, there's really nothing to be scared of. This is just an old house. We mustn't let our imaginations run away with us. ",Classic
26405, I don't take no orders from you. ,Classic
52945," Gone round the back, down the side alley. ",Classic
35897," Ben, are you all right? ",Classic
65684, Right. ,Classic
128753," Oh, yes. That's the trouble with manual override. ",Classic
76045, We shall destroy man and reclaim the planet. ,Classic
86060, Oh? And how should we do that? ,Classic
60033, Sir. ,Classic
121395," Oh, I think he found the whole thing a little too much, but he'll be all right. ",Classic
28585, About twenty. ,Classic
54801," Yes, Brigadier, I'm afraid it is. ",Classic
58572, They've gone through into the small bore workings on level eight. I've sent five men after them. ,Classic
98668," Yes, but the arm's the source of the infection. It might stop it spreading. ",Classic
64490, Then where are the astronauts? ,Classic
150052, You will see. We Sontarans lead. We never follow. ,Classic
134426, Remember the Doctor! Remember Nyssa and Tegan. Remember Tegan?,Classic
40790," You can never tell with the Doctor. Hey, just thought. Do they let lasses into monasteries? ",Classic
104734, I believed in him. For many years I believed in him. ,Classic
110820," Yes, it should have been played at my induction, only fifty times lower. Someone's trying to help us. ",Classic
8400," That's right.  MAN2; Watch them, Number One. ",Classic
49753, Yes. ,Classic
124066," No, no, it's all right, I'm a doctor. ",Classic
8275, There is a quality in human beings which intrigues me. Your concern for each other. I assure you the two men are safe. ,Classic
62816," Well, obviously Baker shot at something he thought was a man. Then something else attacked Baker. ",Classic
150742, May be used in evidence against you. ,Classic
61007, No. ,Classic
89758," He's turned off to the right, Brigadier. I say again. He's turned off to the right. ",Classic
80946, You ordered them? You? ,Classic
125794," Still poring over those old scientific records, Kalmar? ",Classic
146556, That is perfectly correct. ,Classic
150849, Doctor. ,Classic
156892, Such as? ,Classic
103769," All right, but you be very careful. ",Classic
133499, Not yet. I want them where I can see them. ,Classic
160286, But it says ,Classic
47580," I've been looking at the installation plan, and the impeller intake valve in particular. I think I know where the blockage may be. ",Classic
158370, Why is everyone in such a lather? ,Classic
128023," Well, it's very nice of you to put it like that, Monitor. ",Classic
48168," Yes, that's something that's been puzzling me too. But she disturbed somebody who was interfering with the oxygen supplies. ",Classic
153332, Another star traveller? ,Classic
160162, Do what? ,Classic
29000," Aye, Jacob Kewper. And I've no rooms. We're full. ",Classic
20668, It hasn't got the speed. ,Classic
165694, I want water. ,Classic
123385," Romana will stay where she is. Work on your own, Hardin. ",Classic
93339, Let's hope it's convinced them. ,Classic
116587," Well, it is a bit difficult to explain. ",Classic
112401, I hope you do. ,Classic
7329, Which one is the Doctor? ,Classic
36908," Now, my first duty is to thank the strangers, for they have saved our Colony.   A dance festival will be held every year in their memory, and the winners will be awarded the Strangers' Trophy. ",Classic
56226, Our friendship ended the day that you walked out of my laboratory and joined the government administration on T-Mat! ,Classic
53634, Why? Are you in trouble? ,Classic
19446," The planet offers everything we need, but I must warn you. Listen to this carefully.   When we first arrived, we exited ",Classic
162858, Ancelyn. Fitting that you should die amongst peasants. ,Classic
129915," Well, I'm going to try. ",Classic
150009, Privilege. ,Classic
121374," No, let's talk about life while I await my dismissal and eventual execution for dereliction of duty and I really couldn't care less. ",Classic
117211," I already have, sir. ",Classic
81730, But surely there's no alternative once this news gets out? ,Classic
89652, Doctor. Doctor? Good grief. Sergeant Benton? ,Classic
129005," Well, let's read the history of Castrovalva. Might tell us why. ",Classic
150569, No! I don't want to be turned into an Androgum! ,Classic
27293, They have not developed like we have. They are savages! Come on. ,Classic
165360, I'll always love you. I'll always love you. I'll always love you. ,Classic
79286," Yes, yes, I'm afraid so. ",Classic
137235, Look. ,Classic
127869, No! ,Classic
136653, Entertainment. Children half price. Step this way please for the spectacle of a lifetime. Tread the mystic corridors of time to visit the dark and distant shores of the imagination. ,Classic
16423," Oh, we haven't done very well so far, Doctor, have we? Let's face it. First of all, we land on top of a skyscraper, now we land on a crummy old ship. What we need is space. ",Classic
70410," Yes, well, you'll be doomed along with me. ",Classic
29101, I said lay off. What's he done to you? ,Classic
74521, Free? With your people imprisoned by ritual and superstition? ,Classic
93489, And then when the Kaled dome exploded ,Classic
75789, He's lying! He's trying to frighten you! ,Classic
67327, Buffer controls? ,Classic
125264, There is one isolated planet at extreme limit of scanner range. ,Classic
99220, So sorry to have kept you waiting. ,Classic
144232, I'm sorry to have detained you. ,Classic
82415, And I warn the President that the people of Earth will no longer tolerate these insulting and murderous attacks! I hear the cries all about me. Attack Draconia! Attack now! Earth will not produce peace at the price of humiliation! There is only one solution now! War! War! War! ,Classic
62368," Well, I'm trying to devise a weapon that we can use against them. Well, it's not very efficient, I know, but it's the best that I can do. And then you've got to take me to the security area of that factory. ",Classic
23305, Not today. ,Classic
164751, Why do I feel there's something different about this place? ,Classic
45414," Oh, no. ",Classic
60600, We've got no choice. We have to do what they say. ,Classic
114896," Very well, I'll make you an offer. One thousand gold pieces if you can mend our android. ",Classic
149776, They're incompetent meddlers. ,Classic
39190," No, Mister Terrall, I am not a student of human nature. I am a professor of a far wider academy, of which human nature is merely a part. All forms of life interest me. ",Classic
36364," This is the man. You will hear him speak. Speak, Controller, speak! ",Classic
133085," It's too soon, Leader. ",Classic
131623," Oh, it takes more than a pair of flintlocks to damage an android. ",Classic
96456," No, shush. ",Classic
29285," You see Paul, Tom. Well, he's the gibbet. ",Classic
58226," Is that a, is that a Beta Dart? ",Classic
88377," Possibly. But if you can persuade your miners to go back to work, I think I can persuade the Federation to improve conditions now, and not wait until the war is over. ",Classic
83100, I obey. ,Classic
64164, Everything here is recorded. ,Classic
154401," I've told you, it was a ploy. I would never want to harm Peri. ",Classic
124053, Vanished? ,Classic
75010, Those are the last known positions of the missing vessels so far as we can estimate. ,Classic
157204, Raita! ,Classic
5588," I'm terribly sorry to disturb you. We know what a terrible ordeal you've been through, but we think you might be able to help us. ",Classic
97859, Morbius is dead. ,Classic
98545, I wonder. ,Classic
50974, For centuries we have lived in peace. We have proved that universal gentleness will cause aggression to die. ,Classic
8266," I should think the why's fairly obvious, wouldn't you? ",Classic
158628," It's us, Mel and the Doctor. You haven't forgotten us, have you, Glitz? ",Classic
140684," Even if you. Even if you reach this Tower, what are you going to do? ",Classic
30209, What do you mean? ,Classic
40071," What exactly happened here, Jamie? What did you do? What sequence did you use? ",Classic
73383, Whoever is operating the time machine is an enemy of the Daleks. All enemies of the Daleks must be destroyed! Exterminate them!,Classic
106961," Adam, Adam. Our work is at a critical stage. Your discovery could be one of the most important milestones in human development. Your work will fundamentally affect how man views himself. We cannot be interrupted at this moment of destiny. ",Classic
66355, At reduced revs? ,Classic
36601, Officia is to increase pressure. ,Classic
46615, I reckon he ought to give himself up now. ,Classic
156558, Radiation wave meter. That's what we came here for. ,Classic
123379," But the test I made here with the girl Romana, they weren't fakes. We created negative time images. It worked! ",Classic
70942, The leader of the colonists! ,Classic
82330, No! ,Classic
46756," What, what's happened, sir? ",Classic
58582, Can we rest a moment? ,Classic
34292," When he talks of his project, have you noticed his eyes? They light up like this! ",Classic
70664," No, 2471.",Classic
116929, The Tardis! It's gone!   ,Classic
73066, You've already felt its power. ,Classic
41966," Hey, Doctor. Songsten, he's unconscious. ",Classic
51205, Obey the Dominator. Clear the site. Work. Work. ,Classic
111908, You! Here! ,Classic
44824, Swann. Have you ever thought what would happen to us if Salamander didn't come back from the surface one day? ,Classic
59496," Who? Civilians? Well, tell them to wait. I'm having my tea. ",Classic
69002, Why the delay? I take it that I'm to be killed eventually? ,Classic
12652," Put your hands over the oars, or he'll kill you! ",Classic
155353, Yes. ,Classic
130634," Oh, Doctor, you've frightened me. ",Classic
136081," Good morning, my Lady Tanha. ",Classic
139049, Isn't it always dark? ,Classic
101534, Well? ,Classic
157582, Unless he was taken by the cleaners? ,Classic
421," There was a tree and the creature came from in it. And the fire, it came out of his fingers. ",Classic
50560, Intelligence? ,Classic
126084, He'll kill him. ,Classic
34641, Will do. ,Classic
157730, Please stop. ,Classic
46250, Weams? Weams!   What?   Good Lord.   ,Classic
20922," Oh, nonsense, nonsense. Earth must be warned about the Daleks and about Chen. ",Classic
19374, Proceed. ,Classic
4650, Choice? What choice? ,Classic
123896, It's no good. Every time we try to ,Classic
115763, This isn't Rohm-Dutt. ,Classic
53627, Good. As long they don't give the game away too soon. ,Classic
63588, The other prisoner has been released. ,Classic
122707, Where is she? ,Classic
91299, Enemies of humanity are attacking us. You must take this gun and destroy them. ,Classic
146375," There wasn't. But we're here, he's here. Things change, Peri. ",Classic
24745, This is Refusis contacting spaceship Ark. ,Classic
131091, We must do something. ,Classic
117899, Negative. It is a question of synaptic adhesion. ,Classic
24137, Quiet!   What's the matter? Are you crying? ,Classic
102457, Now we must destroy us. ,Classic
146146, Lock them in the bunker. ,Classic
155189, Stay with him. I'll send help. Move. ,Classic
104303, Think. I'm going to have some supper. ,Classic
149197," Maudlin claptrap. The talents of these geniuses should be harnessed to a superior vision. With their help, I could turn this insignificant planet into a power base unique in the universe. ",Classic
48174," Well, it's only a theory at the moment. ",Classic
5058, What have you done with Ian? ,Classic
27965," Jano, since you have destroyed the power you held over Chal and his people, you realise now of course, you've got to learn to live together. ",Classic
107542, It has been mentioned. ,Classic
63494, He thought if he could warn the Silurians first. ,Classic
126247, ,Classic
23754," The King has summoned the council. I must return to the Louvre. Take care of him, Nicholas. ",Classic
42885, What did you have to bring him back here for? Another mouth to feed. ,Classic
28136," Now gentlemen, I must apologise for the absence of Professor Brett. I'm sure he'll be along in a moment or two if you will just bear with us. It is, after all, his show. ",Classic
35580, Why can't you squirt it at them like you did just now? ,Classic
97471, Mark thirty. AGS reading four hundred plus one. ,Classic
157845, Return to Red Kang Base and 'ware Cleaners! Build high for happiness. ,Classic
72373," Yes, well, you're lucky I heard you. ",Classic
122366, Doctor? What doctor? ,Classic
37894, How many of these young people do you hope to abduct? ,Classic
47318," Has Mister Lutyens arrive there yet, sir? ",Classic
67943, Is this man a member of your staff? ,Classic
101220," We've landed, Sarah. ",Classic
143569," Twentieth century Earth, it seems. ",Classic
22615," Yes, of course. ",Classic
43275," I don't intend to leave you here as hors d'oeuvre, laddie. ",Classic
98937, Surely you're exaggerating. ,Classic
111050, As long as the Tardis remains secure. ,Classic
3650, Your grandfather must have nearly finished the work in your caravan by now. ,Classic
115997, That's weird. It's as though something's lifted up the whole bed and then settled back again. ,Classic
14545, What's this? ,Classic
28939," No, I don't think we've met before, no.",Classic
92121, What was that she just said? ,Classic
121192, Yes. ,Classic
146501, Standing by. ,Classic
8584," Paris, eh? A hundred miles or so either way is to be expected. After all, it's only a fraction of the distance we've covered. It's quite accurate, in fact. ",Classic
8592," Yes. What do you make of it, Barbara? ",Classic
161062, They didn't understand me. ,Classic
56125, You saw! Do you think I want to die like that? I want to live!,Classic
4073, There are robbers and cut-throats on the road. ,Classic
141159, This is the Game of Rassilon. ,Classic
120646, Please allow me to explain. This is not the Doctor speaking. I am simply using his larynx. We Tythonions don't have them. ,Classic
123902," Thank you, mistress. Repairs complete. ",Classic
39794," There we are. Well, what do you think? ",Classic
109429, In. ,Classic
146393," Don't worry, Peri. I won't be putting your life at any risk. Or mine either, for that matter. This is just a simple reconnaissance. ",Classic
32806," Yeah, puts me in mind of what Sergeant King of the Dragoons said, sir. ",Classic
49227, I'm not denying it. ,Classic
164943, You built the damn machine! ,Classic
97991, Master! Master! ,Classic
46148, No. Neither do the other three. ,Classic
142910, Mister Range! ,Classic
61672," On no account. I'm coming down there immediately. In the meantime, carry on with the search. ",Classic
78801," Deep in the earth. Beneath the temple. Dalios has the key. Oh, and Krasis has the key. ",Classic
84719," Aye, so am I. Look, Jo. ",Classic
1941," The ground's very uneven. Sometimes rock, sometimes thick mud. You'll have to watch how you walk. I think it'll be a wise plan to find a place to rest for the night. ",Classic
139348, It's perfectly all right. You may also remove your helmet. The atmosphere is breathable. It's maintained by an invisible energy barrier. ,Classic
152279, Precisely. ,Classic
96474, What? ,Classic
144376, But the unbelievers are harmless. ,Classic
103292, So whoever killed him was strong. Too strong for him to resist.,Classic
65765, Indeed I am. That's why we came here. ,Classic
8509," Good, good. ",Classic
43950, Did he go on the rocket for the Central European Zone? ,Classic
117151, What do you mean? ,Classic
142187," Do you know, I'd love to, but first I must find Tegan and Turlough, and Tegan's grandfather. I gather he's disappeared. Good day!",Classic
141569," You're hardly in a position to give orders, Doctor. ",Classic
139019," Yes, sir. They're being prepared. ",Classic
15633, Come on! Take me to him! Move! Hurry! ,Classic
65712," Well, it's my job to cover any eventuality, Mister Sutton. Now it's time I introduced you to some of the senior staff.",Classic
53267, How fortunate. We need a sprat to catch our mackerel. Take them down to the warehouse area. ,Classic
78968," Oh yes, of course. But by then, Kronos will be free, and the universe will be saved. ",Classic
113103, Then it will be pleasant to destroy it. ,Classic
13903," Oh, the air's terrible. ",Classic
29179," Well, by thunder, ye'll talk to me. Or my name's not Samuel Pike!  ",Classic
46023," They must be on a different level to the Circle Line. I mean, Wait a minute, it's absolutely simple. We go out under the stuff. ",Classic
70499," Well, I can't be absolutely sure. I was pretty busy at the time. But I'm ninety percent certain though. ",Classic
66305, It looks to me as if it's getting pretty well smashed up as it is now. ,Classic
61764, This way. ,Classic
29609, In these dark days honesty surely pays. ,Classic
150672, What's wrong? ,Classic
26074," Oh well, if that's the way you feel. Are you coming Steven? ",Classic
90627, Did you really believe these creatures could overcome the eight legs? They have minds as easily controlled as their own sheep. Why have you come back? ,Classic
22513, Oh dear. ,Classic
42132, Emergency evacuation phasing set. ,Classic
87703," Right, come on.   Stay there.   The Daleks don't seem to be following us. ",Classic
112754," Oh, it's no use once she's made up her mind. I'll have to go after her myself. ",Classic
86797," Er, no, not at the moment, thank you. I'm sorry to bother you like this, but you seem to be the only member of the government still in London. ",Classic
74862, He couldn't. All our men are completely immune to hypnotism.,Classic
160638, I need you and you need you. ,Classic
50210," No, I won't. ",Classic
55229," No, no, I saw it. I saw it! ",Classic
1893, We will direct the air polluted by radiation away from the nuclear reactors into the sonic chamber. ,Classic
41939," Jamie, no! ",Classic
160388," You're right. It's awful. It's tasteless, smug, and worst of all, it's badly constructed, I mean, who writes that stuff? ",Classic
38376," And, er, there was no trouble with the box? ",Classic
13584," Well, it appears, my boy, they've obliged. They've neutralised and completely immobilised this section. ",Classic
45036," Well, you always told me they had priority over everything. ",Classic
60132, You mean there's more like you? ,Classic
103238, I wouldn't say that. ,Classic
6344, A false goddess forbids it. Destroy him. ,Classic
113830," Goddess of war, death and magic. Beware the raven or the crow, Doctor. They are her eyes. ",Classic
9267," Well, I don't know. I somehow took it for granted that you would. ",Classic
3548, I think this is your answer. We found it. ,Classic
80722, Nothing escapes the Drashigs. Even that size they terrify me. ,Classic
87465," Yes, of course. ",Classic
30792," No. No, I've got a better idea. We'll let them land and then ambush them with their own weapons. Put the whole base on red alert.  R/ ",Classic
78902, I demand to be taken to the Lady Galleia! ,Classic
11728, Every error must be corrected. The penetration explosive must strike the fissure correctly if we are to extract the molten core. Have all work tasks been completed? ,Classic
164666, Are you looking for someone? ,Classic
164218, You are interfering. ,Classic
126014," When they have taken the Tower, they will come to attack us. ",Classic
96379," What's that you have, Doctor. ",Classic
146351, But I can. Professor Edgeworth is a merciful being.   He believe in the sanctity of life. I do not. Fail to obey him once more and I will have your minds removed from your bodies and use them as I wish. Have you understood?   I see that you have. ,Classic
15475, Go quickly! ,Classic
7501," Otherwise, you communicate as we do. ",Classic
98497," No, not a hybrid. It's a mysterious, unidentified pod recently discovered by one of our expeditions. ",Classic
17769," Oh, without your help, we'd never have known the Monk was a Viking spy, would we? ",Classic
51083, Yes. ,Classic
114490, I see what you mean about the galaxy. ,Classic
130828, Of course I'm here.   Where else should I be? Did you bring the Not-we woman from the dome? ,Classic
16740," Barbara, my dear, Chesterton is dead. ",Classic
25099, How can we believe anything you say? Everything here is so strange. ,Classic
127765, Good. Ah. ,Classic
41381," Even so, wiser to destroy it. Rinchen or the Doctor. Who is right? I do not know any longer. ",Classic
61555, But Doctor surely we could ,Classic
148216, It's too late. ,Classic
24539, Doctor? Did he say Doctor? Have you been here before? ,Classic
38569, But they made the appointment for ten. Why have we come early? ,Classic
46557, You can't be. ,Classic
7432, We must ask for new orders. ,Classic
83581, Who is he? ,Classic
161386, Is that what we came here for? ,Classic
134919, We must be hallucinating again. ,Classic
7468, The voices. I can hear them. ,Classic
68300," Well, you'd better try it and quick! ",Classic
104571, When shall we go and look for the cave creature? ,Classic
110313, But a lead-lined room would shield you from them. ,Classic
57194," Hey, how do we get hold of Commander Radnor? ",Classic
15278," Commander K division. Alien spaceship in hand, sir. ",Classic
29462," Oh, no consequence, no consequence. Pray, have you breakfasted?",Classic
58672," I had a better idea, that's all. ",Classic
30600," Yes, sir. Yes I'm here. You've sent my son to his death. You realise that, I hope. ",Classic
9556," He betrayed us, Barbara. ",Classic
79638, In the legends of your people I am called Omega. ,Classic
159451, Doctor! ,Classic
132917," It's no go. The scanner registers the flare, but the computer doesn't. It's weird. ",Classic
94414," We have enough parts in our ship to build an entirely new Cyber Army, and this time, Doctor, it will be invincible. Cybermen function   More efficiently than animal organisms. That is why we will rule the galaxy. ",Classic
65323," Anything you say, Mister Cornish. ",Classic
158271, What is it? ,Classic
127126," Is it true, Seron? Kassia tells us her husband concealed knowledge from the consuls. ",Classic
142419," Fortunately, most of them end up safely locked away. ",Classic
121126, No. K9 checked all the planets he'd been to. ,Classic
133042, Sooner or later. ,Classic
4143," Look, it's no good. How will it appear if I stand before the Khan without you? You speak for Noghai. Silence could mean war. ",Classic
73032," You can't go in now, sir. You said yourself it would be suicide. ",Classic
88616," Well, only if you let him. You've just got to stand up for yourself. ",Classic
103620, Kill them. ,Classic
152361," Oh yeah, well, that's just my other voice, you know. I use that just for kind of professional duties, you know. ",Classic
43988," Yes, Leader. ",Classic
85179," No. No, I am the one who speaks. Think of our great plan, our dream! ",Classic
133392," Stowaways or pirates, you're still murderers. Keep moving. ",Classic
29769, Avery's gold? ,Classic
155428, What's a thremmatologist doing in an isolation room wearing a surgical mask? ,Classic
66211, Only that he went berserk and started killing people. ,Classic
144595," Howard is safe on Earth. His appearance was a projection of your own energy, which overwhelmed my personality circuits. ",Classic
89921," Yes, yes. See if you can keep the others away for half an hour or so, will you? ",Classic
133130, How much longer before activation? ,Classic
27865, It's hard to tell. It's too dark. ,Classic
127859," No, thank you. Look, you stay here and get your breath back, and I'll go. ",Classic
73971," Oh, Shura. He left just to send a message and we never saw nor heard from him again. We assumed he must be dead. ",Classic
85750, The fellow has the gall of a camel and the cunning of a fox. ,Classic
154005, Further along the shore. ,Classic
162699, And his personality. ,Classic
73208, Oh. ,Classic
87411," But what about you? Oh no, don't tell me. You're a Time Lord. ",Classic
91072," Oh, no. ",Classic
42395," Yes, I did. And trust you to think of something like that. ",Classic
134597," Oh, I wouldn't have thought it was that. ",Classic
30098," Oh, like toast my dear. Now, did you find everything you want? ",Classic
10191," It's much better when they're a long way away, isn't it. ",Classic
58483," Then the flight destination must be Lobos. Clancey's home planet. We've got him, Ian. ",Classic
111096, Where are we going? ,Classic
44066," No. I, I don't think so. ",Classic
96893, It's bone dry. Can't have been any rain here for more than a week.   Now I wonder what could be causing that. ,Classic
1861, Help. Cannot control. Cannot control. Help me. Help me. Help! Help! Help! Help! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! ,Classic
419, Take me back to my ship and I will make fire for you. All the fire you want. ,Classic
3642," For me this journey, in spite of all the dangers, was the happiest time of my life, until Tun-Huang. ",Classic
140905," Yeah, right.   Doctor? Missed. ",Classic
76820," Listen to me. Summon my council. Go, beat the war gong! ",Classic
1607, It is nearly completed. ,Classic
36425," Oh, you're going to issue them with masks, aren't you? You aren't taking them down there without any protection? ",Classic
122045," No. Ah, here's a notion. The defence shield on the door's on a different circuit. It might be possible to extrude it. ",Classic
53145," I expect that he's all right. He was all right this morning when we left him. Brigadier, tell me more about this International Electromatics set-up. ",Classic
32569, Why? ,Classic
16221," Yes, now I can ",Classic
129276," Adric pre-programmed it. Whatever you did to the console, we'd have ended up at Castrovalva. ",Classic
67322, Section three shut down. Shut down completed. ,Classic
163841, I know a nice little restaurant in the Khyber Pass. ,Classic
8293, And that smudge means that it was written just before we got it.  1 ,Classic
76135," I couldn't, even if I wanted to. No, I'm not meant to. I couldn't open it, even if I wanted to. No, it's only meant for one person, and or creature. It will only open for one person. ",Classic
37138," Doctor, look! ",Classic
23157," Let us pass, sir! ",Classic
99700," All the more reason to act quickly. One day, two days at the most. The poison is still ready? Well, what's wrong? ",Classic
124135," Quite right, but academic. ",Classic
100451," What do you think of these plate, Doctor? ",Classic
44443," An attempt has been made to rescue this man. Get him out to the car.   I'm sorry, Janos. ",Classic
162966," No, explosives. ",Classic
44705," Colin and Mary were just teenagers then. Look at them now. We fed ourselves. But what's more than that, we are fighting back! We are doing something! ",Classic
103376, It's a gift! May I remind you we'll all go together when she blows if you don't cut the power! ,Classic
147247, Hmm? ,Classic
152587," All very clever. And apart from a little grave-robbing, what else have you been up to? ",Classic
104907," When it comes to it, I don't suppose anybody is. ",Classic
16364, Must be a kind of tight squeeze. They can't all have come out of there. ,Classic
30805," Oh, he's just the same.   The quack's been to see him. He says he'll be all right, though. ",Classic
111378, I put it there. ,Classic
53929," Yes. Yes, Jimmy, you're right. Of course, what we really need is some sort of evidence, some proof. ",Classic
90500, I can see. I can see a blue crystal. ,Classic
28578," Well if this is so, why weren't the police informed? ",Classic
125988," No.   It's all right, it's all right. I've got other things to worry about. But, I can lend you a very useful tool. Armoured. Immune to hypnotism. ",Classic
109106, Three metres twenty. ,Classic
22634, Directional? But with this we can get back to Kembel. ,Classic
48301," She was here, standing along side you. ",Classic
10098," Doctor, whatever it is that's killing these things, could it kill us too? ",Classic
107544," No. Only down there, where you just come from. But it's getting darker slowly. ",Classic
110174, I did not know. ,Classic
30633, Spaceships sir. In formation!  ,Classic
118165, Very regrettable. ,Classic
84330," Oh, but I'm interested. You're venting one tank and filling another. Is that it? ",Classic
155308, Indeed? ,Classic
31684," If that's going to be your attitude, I suggest that we ",Classic
53574," Well, you. I don't know. ",Classic
126789," So it has. Nothing. Well, that's something. ",Classic
18262, I have done wrong. I did not understand. ,Classic
142848," Be careful, Norna. ",Classic
132048, Impossible. I must have picked it.,Classic
101498," A wise and beloved President brutally shot down in his last hour of office? No matter how much time we allow, that fact won't alter. ",Classic
87995, You will climb to the summit and place the explosives on the beacon. ,Classic
83562, Seal off all levels above them. They must be driven down to the deepest levels. ,Classic
53741, Right. ,Classic
104355," It is not easy at this hour, Lord. ",Classic
98866, Stop panicking. Tie him up. Tim him up. ,Classic
23243, Pleasant journey. Goodbye. ,Classic
130046," But you're wrong, Doctor. He's civilised ",Classic
28268, What are you phoning the hospitals for? ,Classic
72001," Doctor, look! ",Classic
145585," Well, how can we, with an android guard outside? ",Classic
141828," That's far enough, Doctor. ",Classic
74967," Only puppets, you know? For children. ",Classic
83140," Get your rope, Doctor! ",Classic
119313," No, I hit him. Now, can we stop wondering about conjuring tricks with chickens and get out of this place? ",Classic
98197, You mean Maren and the Doctor plotted together? ,Classic
63223, I wonder how many of them there are. ,Classic
34299," I have heard such words from you before, Ramo. ",Classic
148707, It's no good. ,Classic
27535, It's no use. He's coming here. ,Classic
35137, Twenty four hours. ,Classic
13601, Just turn up the recorder. ,Classic
131659," Well, we may just get a high enough pitch to vibrate the android to pieces. ",Classic
29195," Oh, let me make him talk, Captain. ",Classic
42315," Oh, where to? ",Classic
106296,"   Affirmative, master. ",Classic
36227, What law? ,Classic
72829," More waiting, Sergeant. ",Classic
113985," Come on, girls. Back to the cottage. I've got lots of research to show you. Hop on the back. ",Classic
96666, No! I am Sutekh! ,Classic
126927," Unexpected, certainly, but I am never one to jump to conclusions, particularly in the presence of others. There is rumour enough abroad. ",Classic
140707, Does it help? ,Classic
100677, It's much more complicated than it seems. ,Classic
57367, Be careful with this. ,Classic
30584," I'm afraid we lost them, General. ",Classic
137405," Look, it's not quite like that. If we could just get some medical help and get back to the Tardis, it'd all be ",Classic
17125," Well, they weren't getting any younger, were they? ",Classic
118378, Statement. Your purpose in coming here was to sabotage Dalek operations. True or false? ,Classic
71069, Radar printing confirm terrain firm. ,Classic
147280," Oh, what? ",Classic
26065," Now what's going on here? Okay now, boys, put them guns away. Now, Charlie, got yerself a new singer maybe? ",Classic
54813," Must go, sir. Over and out. ",Classic
79005, You? But you're a girl. ,Classic
86778, Typical! Run away and play while the grown-ups get on with the real work. ,Classic
19499, Asleep. ,Classic
43760, They seem remarkably dedicated. ,Classic
148739," Did he take it, or been given it? ",Classic
51259, I'm glad you appreciate that to attempt sabotage would be pointless. ,Classic
35526," If they don't get our next transmission, they'll send up a relief rocket.",Classic
39261," Oh, you should have thought of that some time ago. ",Classic
40429, That way. ,Classic
33361, What? ,Classic
53320," I did, sir. ",Classic
55128," Come out, you Krotons, and fight! Come out! ",Classic
39979, Eh? ,Classic
105301," Of course, on Pharos they had slaves to keep the bonfires going. ",Classic
21112, I'll get it next time! ,Classic
137292, To that building we saw. Use their phone. ,Classic
67659, Doctor? ,Classic
54843, A field? There's nothing here. ,Classic
11186, Baker! ,Classic
37133, He's reaching suffocation point. Hurry.,Classic
77300," Stand back!   This is it then. Get inside, Miss. ",Classic
73694, Be quiet. ,Classic
52286," Doctor? Are you all right? What's happening?   Oh, so that's how you can see, is it? With that wee lighthouse of yours. ",Classic
77361, They're evil! Don't deserve to live! ,Classic
88286, Doctor. ,Classic
71466, Then declare ourselves an independent republic. Break with Earth altogether. ,Classic
145343, I think I have made the right decision. I only wish the execution could be made public. ,Classic
51122, What do you think you're doing? ,Classic
130944, What? ,Classic
104738," Next month, the Great Chang would have performed before the Queen Empress at Buckingham Palace. I, the son of a peasant. ",Classic
49790, Communication beam to Earth? ,Classic
71720," We won't and you know it! If you don't help us, we're all going to die!",Classic
89252, Wouldn't I? Turn that alarm off. ,Classic
127090," Those stones have been hit by a plasma beam. They're disintegrated. Look, the sun's coming up. You're right, it is morning. Tremas, you know what I need more than anything else in the universe? ",Classic
115758, I'll try and think of one. ,Classic
47086, Where's he going? ,Classic
128777, It can't possibly be. ,Classic
25168," I can see that. The point is, what are they doing with them? ",Classic
57190, Right. The Professor and I are coming back now. ,Classic
29612," Such guile and wisdom, eh Mister Cherub? A master of men, no less. ",Classic
90705, And it will shake up the brain cells a little. You may find his behaviour somewhat erratic. ,Classic
146433," Don't you think we should just look, just in case? ",Classic
108896," That's a hundred thousand years old. The Minyan civilisation was destroyed a hundred thousand years ago, on the other side of the universe. ",Classic
57228, Final checkout routines under way. ,Classic
149472, But Faraday? ,Classic
41958," I have to. This things that's here, this evil, it will spread. It has to be stopped and I think I can do it. Thomni, will you help me? It will be dangerous. ",Classic
117506," Well, then Mentalis will go into it's Armageddon sequence, we'll be bits of dust flying round the cosmos, including the Marshal. You might even tell him that. What are you waiting for? ",Classic
93549, No. A little surgery on the brain will remove these stupid emotions and still allow us to make use of his inventive skills. ,Classic
26486, And what was they askin'? ,Classic
38774, Mollie shall bring you some tea in a minute. ,Classic
140382," Tomorrow's Times. And, er, and who is this? ",Classic
105788," I agree. The question is, do we go out and see? ",Classic
141663, Get out! ,Classic
149158, Don't come any further. Touch me and their orders are to kill. ,Classic
124034, Now what would cause that? Thinness of the atmosphere? ,Classic
34605," If we don't stop Zaroff soon, we'll all be for the chop. ",Classic
63620, This whole place should be closed down and put in strict quarantine immediately. ,Classic
60220, But you? There's a security alarm out for you. ,Classic
45089, Where are you? ,Classic
119098," Well, this detective, Duggan, he annoyed me. He stopped watching the painting and he started watching me. ",Classic
143713, You'd better inform HQ about what's happened. ,Classic
131926," Ah, yes, to live a primitive life without grace or beauty. ",Classic
98710, Did you see his face? Where's he gone? ,Classic
119853, Don't be a philistine. ,Classic
125231, Yes. ,Classic
21371, Treachery? I've known this man all my life. He's no traitor. ,Classic
84078," Oh dear, oh dear, you'll think we're woefully ill-equipped. ",Classic
102082, I'd be careful of that if I were you. It's an ultrabeam accelerator. ,Classic
156749," Not admiration, fascination. And sadness. If only the Rani could have redirected her incredible talents for good. ",Classic
66440," Ah, go away and give me some peace. ",Classic
81350, It was when I heard that noise. Didn't you hear it? ,Classic
12653," In, out, in, out, in, out! Keep rowing, keep rowing, do you hear! In, out, in, out, in, out! Keep rowing. ",Classic
97979," Well, I have a feeling he's keeping something else there too. Something far worse than a headless body. ",Classic
44582, And they're closing in. ,Classic
23594," Well, all right. I'll come with you. ",Classic
109744, Course? ,Classic
154196," The Brown, eh? And where is this place? ",Classic
80105," Yes, well, the party's over now. You young men and I go back to our time zones. Though considering the way things have been going, well, I shudder to think what you'll do with out me. ",Classic
124773," Look, I'm sure this ceremonial's all terribly impressive ",Classic
133657, I understand some of the principles. ,Classic
42884, Where is he? Where is he? Where is he?,Classic
33547, The very last place you would think of looking for him. ,Classic
163662," Using a telephone, Reverend Matthews? Surely you're far too fastidious a creature for such demonic apparatus. ",Classic
88345," First the armoury, and now this. ",Classic
47816," Oh, well I'm not so sure. I don't really like been scared out of my wits every second. ",Classic
70213, Is something wrong? Are you all right?,Classic
45976, Evans? ,Classic
100330," Then you will be swept aside like the dirt that you are. Die, Doctor. ",Classic
68198," Tell me, how do you intend to activate these flowers? ",Classic
86950, I've brought you something to eat. ,Classic
2777," Barbara could be right, Doctor. ",Classic
10909, Help me! ,Classic
134767, Go into my Tardis. I am the Master. You will obey me. ,Classic
76550, And now you say he's mutating? ,Classic
89248, Come on! Aggedor fights for us!,Classic
128393, We're being taken right out of time and space. ,Classic
86728," Well, you've got a pass, haven't you? ",Classic
77572," Yes, sir. The where, sir? The Newton Institute? ",Classic
84450," Look, I'll show you. ",Classic
65275, I shall maintain radio silence until the necessary landing instructions. ,Classic
57899," Because of the rockets. Oh, I see. So whoever broke up the machine is sending all the pieces to the same place? ",Classic
24248," What do you think they'll do to us, Doctor? ",Classic
10506, The insecticide. Is that why I feel like this? ,Classic
54175, The people I'm trying to convince are a little more sceptical. ,Classic
44926, You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you. ,Classic
103193, He was hiding Kerril's body in that hopper and got trapped when it was turned on. Now that's a fact. ,Classic
144477, I'll cable my address from Morocco. You could send the money to me there. ,Classic
2844," Always a trifle too big for me. You know, I acquired that ulster from Gilbert and Sullivan. ",Classic
122275, Get up! Get up. Into the hold. Move!   Your friend can rot in his black hole for all I care. ,Classic
11146, You did what? ,Classic
39277, Why not break the door down? They're strong enough. ,Classic
35700," Come on, come on. It seems to move so slowly. ",Classic
81513, To steal the cargo. ,Classic
6090," No, not to Autloc. ",Classic
131238, Who can tell? ,Classic
81506," Must have been some kind of neuronic stun gun. I wonder why they didn't kill me? What exactly happened, Jo? ",Classic
147708," Oh, what is that terrible smell? ",Classic
31230, These comic opera guards of yours do have some uses after all. ,Classic
138912, Right. ,Classic
79355, You faded him again. ,Classic
118091," Well, he'll live. ",Classic
31310," Sorry, Janley. ",Classic
49556, What about you? You look done in. ,Classic
64420, If you make it. I'll go with you. Keep to the prepared route and clear the away ahead of us. You bring up the rear. ,Classic
163415, Ace! ,Classic
115655, Magnificent. How much do I owe you? ,Classic
161405, I'd feel a lot safer and happier inside the Tardis. ,Classic
83830, I wouldn't advise you to try. ,Classic
155697, We did not request refreshment. ,Classic
90987," Well, we'd better test it. ",Classic
152386, Quiet. ,Classic
16908," Well, yes. Apart from those fungus things. ",Classic
2342, Follow and kill her. ,Classic
26067," Now Charlie, am I singin' here or ain't I? ",Classic
24219," What is it made of? You can't scratch it, can you? ",Classic
43762," There.   Tell me, Miss Ferrier, do you hate me? ",Classic
136878, Hopefully. ,Classic
101666, What? ,Classic
69927, Winser? ,Classic
153606," Why, Grell? Why? ",Classic

41783," Oh, it's that hypnotism thing. Can you not do anything about it?",Classic
18646," It's getting darker, Doctor. ",Classic
148770," The ways of the ruler are fraught with uncertainty, are they not, Sil? ",Classic
157851, Anything! Anything! ,Classic
90483, The recognition of friends is not always easy. Tell me about this crystal you stole. ,Classic
41078, Silence. Who are these people? ,Classic
136514," Because you're not the first. Dojjen, the Director before Ambril, he too was convinced that the Mara would return. ",Classic
147356, That's not Payne. It's too big. Shut that racket. ,Classic
17571," You open the door? No, Doctor, that's not a very good idea. ",Classic
133515, Could that be the Doctor? ,Classic
24688," Yes, yes, I can quite understand that. That is why you destroyed the Launcher? ",Classic
74822, Mayday. Mayday. SS ,Classic
34414," Tell them, Ramo. ",Classic
58820, Escape? That door's the only way out of here. ,Classic

75484," What's wrong now, sir? ",Classic
60426, I hoped he might be. ,Classic
47250," But Mister Robson, please listen. Look, this ties up with what I've been trying to tell you. For three weeks now, there's been a regular and increasing build up of fall in pressure. Look, I think you should at least look at my calculations. The time ratio of the increases and falls corresponds to form a definite progressive pattern.",Classic
146343, Warn away. ,Classic
150490," Shockeye, show this young woman around. She might be particularly interested in the kitchens. ",Classic
83841, Right. ,Classic
51129, I don't know. ,Classic
117402, It's not irradiated. ,Classic
18341, That what? ,Classic
132935, Snyder and the others have just gone off the scanner. ,Classic
108369," By accident, as usual. ",Classic
147601, They haven't. A time vessel landed on Telos. The Cybermen were able to capture it. ,Classic
162315, Ah. ,Classic
149081, Wait!   Let go of me! ,Classic
1324," But how can we, Susan? ",Classic
121767," Hello, Romana. Everything all right? ",Classic
51220, Just been thinking. Have you noticed how stuffy in here it's getting? ,Classic
130932, Can't we do anything? ,Classic
116184," When the servants of Kroll appear in his guise, they are part of him, doing as he bids them. ",Classic
163336, Good idea. ,Classic
114299," Oh, I thought you were. Are you all right, K9? ",Classic
158028," And by completely ignoring the overspill from the fourth dimension they sometimes build one port right on top of the other, only realising it when there's an interface slippage. ",Classic
32847," You can despatch this one, Sergeant, and this strange looking scoundrel. ",Classic
56122," Do you think that will make any difference in the end? As soon as he gets what he wants out of us, we'll mean nothing to him. ",Classic
113018, And that's when the lights change. ,Classic
118469, You have an idea? ,Classic
132959, Whereabouts? ,Classic
143936, There's nothing to worry about. ,Classic
645," How about giving us a hand, Doctor? ",Classic
38771, How do you do? Have you seen the Doctor this morning? ,Classic
25573, That gives us a two to one chance over you. ,Classic
113641, Master? ,Classic
157946," Please, please! We must move on to the main problem. How to persuade Kroagnon to leave his safety and come to a place of our choosing where we can trap and defeat him. ",Classic
103091," Yes, Commander. ",Classic
5366," Well it does suggest you had an accomplice, I agree. So you had better produce him. That's my advice to you, for what it's worth. ",Classic
10287, Take it easy. ,Classic
77627," Or any other time machine, for that matter. So, if the Master turns up again ",Classic
163900, You don't frighten me! Doctor! ,Classic
118585, Doctor! ,Classic
107679," Citizen Cordo, District Four? ",Classic
87868, Exterminate! Am losing control! Am losing control! Am ,Classic
126600," K9! Where have you been, my dear old thing? ",Classic
133794, The freighter has been evacuated. ,Classic
78587," I am Krasis, High Priest of the temple of Poseidon. ",Classic
115676," Oh, but surely nobody would give arms to those savages? ",Classic
150027, It just looks very complicated. ,Classic
92193, We'd better look. ,Classic
40542, What? ,Classic
119000, I want to see it today. ,Classic
6733," Oh, we're like drowning people, Doctor. ",Classic
76579," No, London. London on the ground. ",Classic
163490, Thought? Or wished it so. ,Classic
45181," It's too late, Giles. I know everything. ",Classic
102524," Doctor? Doctor, wake up. Please, wake up! Please!   Doctor! ",Classic
39013," Oh, yes. I quite understand. ",Classic
46138," Well, it's simple enough. We lay the explosives on the trolley and set a triggering device, and then blow it up while it's on the move. ",Classic
159257, Doctor. ,Classic
92125, We shall override them. ,Classic
64776, I'm the one dealing with these creatures. ,Classic
163434, I don't know. Which way did Morgaine leave? ,Classic
155598," I should think that when man first discovered fire there were those who were equally appalled and wanted it suppressed.   If they'd prevailed, the human race would still be cowering in caves. ",Classic
129469," No, I don't. And if we don't get back to Heathrow, I'm going to lose my job. ",Classic
63145," Yes, of course, sir. ",Classic
92223," That was a close one. You all right, Sarah? ",Classic
83110, Have a look at this.   What do you make of it? ,Classic
39360, What have you done? ,Classic
89083, They are both traitors!,Classic
26190," Oh, yeah. ",Classic
123319, What? ,Classic
155779," Er, wait a second. Animal-kind. ",Classic
143009, Meteorites? In such quantities? ,Classic
6192, My servants also? ,Classic
95489,"   Get the Brigadier.   Broton, your spaceship's been destroyed. This building is surrounded by soldiers. ",Classic
148861, Maybe. ,Classic
102318," What do you mean, throw them? What is a Horda, anyway? ",Classic
84953, But why? ,Classic
87628, And the true reason that we need the chemical parrinium must remain secret. ,Classic
84789," No, no, no, I wouldn't let her through there. ",Classic
83874," No, no, no - not there, you'll have the lot over. Not there either. You'll contaminate my spores. ",Classic
165405," Survival of the fittest. Rather a glib generalisation, don't you think? Survival for what, Mister er? ",Classic
143764," Tea, sir? ",Classic
65064, We can't hurry the M3 variant.,Classic
110012," Just so, Lord Savar. Cyclic burst. ",Classic
10339," All right, let's go and get this muck off our hands. ",Classic
57138," Well, no problem about that. The gardens are full of the stuff.",Classic
40841, Who is this man? ,Classic
96423, Doctor! ,Classic
10031, What is it? ,Classic
27504, Will they come here? ,Classic
40655, Then I'll go with you. ,Classic
8789," Yes, yes. James Stirling. Find James Stirling and tell him to get back to England. He has important information. I understand and I promise. Where shall I find him, Webster? ",Classic
155823, We've been over that. ,Classic
36981, Maybe. But not one that's not been developed yet on this planet.,Classic
124312, Tigella. Let's start with Tigella. ,Classic
9671, Yes. I'm afraid I can't remember them. ,Classic
136850, Why not? ,Classic
4086," What do you hope to gain by this gesture, Ian? I'm sorry. When do you want to start? ",Classic
94096," I'm afraid he's had it, Doctor. ",Classic
30876," We are starting at T-minus two minutes, starting from now! ",Classic
110557," Yes, Excellence. ",Classic
148760, What is it? ,Classic
75543," All right, Summers. Radio Captain Hart the moment you surface. Tell him we're immobilised on the sea bed by some unknown force and intruders have broken through the hull. ",Classic
10389," The tests are very satisfactory. I'm sending in the report. Yes, it is a bad line, isn't it. Well, I would say that DN6, as they call it, is about sixty percent improvement on normal insecticide. Yes, I know I'm not usually so enthusiastic, but this is really extraordinary. Crossing over to France tonight. And I'll send in the report. Will you send in the authorisation? Good. I'll tell Forrester. Yes. Goodbye. ",Classic
148363," He's not a fool, your intruder. ",Classic
157984, As you wish. ,Classic
107392, Spare us the after dinner speech. ,Classic
20391," Oh, stuff and nonsense. Oh, go and feed the sacred serpents or something. If you can't be pleasant at a time like this, Cassandra, I don't want to see you. Oh, Paris! Have the Greeks really gone? ",Classic
99329, Why is it different? ,Classic
16621, Which of the four humans is to be reproduced? ,Classic
14874, I thought he had despised me. ,Classic
153259," Hmm? Oh. Oh, I knew she wouldn't still be here. That girl can't obey an order. ",Classic
7695,   Susan. ,Classic
147153, There's no need. I'll get a cab. ,Classic
36692," Rah, rah, rah! ",Classic
76546, Another mutant? ,Classic
11169," David, David, perhaps you could. I could ask Grandfather. I'm sure he'd let you come. We could go to a place that had never even heard of Daleks. ",Classic
13692, You delay. Now the child will die. Thus you will learn total obedience. ,Classic
73805," There will always be people who need discipline, Doctor. ",Classic
27711, Doctor! ,Classic
9849," A carriage? Oh, that's better than a tumbril. ",Classic
120804," I came as an ambassador to buy chlorophyll, but Adrasta imprisoned me. However, she failed to prevent the other half of my ship from communicating that fact to my brothers on Tythonus. They will have taken that as an act of aggression and responded accordingly. ",Classic
29061," No, matey, I saw you a-whispering something in his ear. What was you saying to him, ay? ",Classic
119929, What is it? ,Classic
49263, Prepare phase four.,Classic
29388," Yeah, and the Tardis too. In fact, if I know him, I bet he's back in it all comfy. ",Classic
129438, Earrings. ,Classic
67729," You know, Brigadier, your methods have all the refined subtlety of a bull in a china shop. ",Classic
71523," Well, we've done it. ",Classic
155169," No! No, this is all wrong. Every instinct of which I am capable would have made me prevent her. ",Classic
25547, I got a shock! ,Classic
104222, To remember nothing since I said goodnight to Casey. ,Classic
120063," Well, I myself have calculated that a bird large enough to lay that egg would have to have a wingspan of at least a mile. ",Classic
158254," If you kill for money, let the girl go. She's worth nothing to you. ",Classic
103828," Oh no, Doctor. I'm going to burn out your brain. Very, very slowly. ",Classic
94682, Looks like it. ,Classic
152127," Now, this is a big day for Tranquil Repose and I don't want anything to go wrong. The key word is respect. To you, the president's wife is a stiff, but to him, she's a loved one who has passed on to pastures finer and lusher than those she knew in life. Now, although the president has yet to arrive, the utmost decorum and good taste will be shown from this moment on. Black cotton gloves will be worn at all times, and there will be no drinking, swearing or smoking of herbal mixture in the presence of the deceased. Are you picking your nose? I should hope not. All necessary conversations will be conducted in a whisper. Anyone who breaks these rules, inadvertently or deliberately, between now and the president's departure will find themselves scrubbing out the preparation room for the next month with a tooth brush. Understood?   Dismissed. ",Classic
134450, Doctor! ,Classic
113491, And it wouldn't have worked anyway. ,Classic
91058," Apparently. And Jellicoe too, and quite a few of the Think Tank lot. ",Classic
9014, We didn't find Grandfather though. We don't even know if he got away. ,Classic
132550, What? Madge? ,Classic
25048," Right, one buzz. Left, two buzzes. Four to start and three to stop. ",Classic
9108, No. I'd just like to know. ,Classic
141460," Oh, I shouldn't think so. They've got a couple of hours to sort out what I've done. ",Classic
150012," Good, because we have about another mile to go. Come on. ",Classic
73190," But there was another you and another me. Well, where've they gone?",Classic
55929," Well, it's your fault. You're making me nervous. ",Classic
107561, Thea. ,Classic
23329, Thanks. ,Classic
36393, Silence. ,Classic
70998, You've got to come with me. ,Classic
22590," Very well, I will hand over the taranium core. ",Classic
143188," No, the State made them a secret. I merely collected the records. ",Classic
136621," In there? Oh no, it's impossible, my Lord. All the passages have been thoroughly explored over the years. ",Classic
12886," Yes, I'd rather thought you'd had it, hmm? ",Classic
26877," Wyatt Earp is no longer a lawman. Besides, he has killed two Clantons. ",Classic
1784, The girl and the young woman. Is that the body of the fourth prisoner? The young man? ,Classic
69823," You know, I would have said that that was a heartbeat.",Classic
143241, We will defeat your goal. ,Classic
133783, The boy's right. There's a chance. Leave now. ,Classic
75077," Yes, yes, yes. ",Classic
88527," Yes, I know. I've just met him in the tunnels. ",Classic
7192," No, but we must get to them as soon as possible. ",Classic
123290," The court, Doctor.   We Argolins have a sacred reminder of the evil that dwells in violence. The Helmet of Theron, who led Argolis into the war that wiped it out. Can you swear your innocence before the Helmet of Theron? ",Classic
19114," I hope so, my dear, I hope so. ",Classic
70511, The Doctor resents his exile bitterly. Do you think he'll co-operate with us? ,Classic
59117," Jumping galactic gob-stoppers, why didn't you tell me it was alive! My fingers. ",Classic
131384, Perhaps you'd better talk to her. ,Classic
136814, Yes. ,Classic
137165, Ah. ,Classic
78868, For giving me the crystal. ,Classic
140062, There is naught we can do. He has Isabella held hostage. ,Classic
118513," We cannot allow aliens to see us in death. It is against, against our code of honour. I'm sure you understand. ",Classic
113431," Mister Fibuli, it's happening again. ",Classic
77170," Look, for heaven's sake, stop dilly-dallying and let's get on with it. These unstable reactions are dangerous. I shall need some equipment. If we don't come up with an effective control system, we'll particle reverse Skybase and we'll be in a bigger mess than we were before.",Classic
69082," Help me! Well, at least help me get him up onto the bed.",Classic
81406, General Williams! I take it a rescue attempt has been mounted? ,Classic
140659," Now, as far as I can make out, there are three entrances. One above, one below, and the main door here. ",Classic
4448, I wish I could remember what it was the Khan said that upset Marco so much. ,Classic
41566, I wish this thing would keep quiet. ,Classic
42811," Well, everything's checked. ",Classic
100474, How did it get there? Man didn't exist in Jurassic times. ,Classic
53457, Leave them to me. I'll take them. ,Classic
79191," We don't find it, Brigadier. If we wait around here long enough, it'll find us.",Classic
15528," They destroyed everything, even our people. Only the children were spared, to work. ",Classic
7711, How long?  1 ,Classic
92266, Where are you going? ,Classic
153868, It's a piece of black light converter aerial. Pure silictone. ,Classic
71239, I want your help. ,Classic
51268," Well, I'm sorry, but I haven't had a chance. Balan told us about it, and with any luck Jamie and Cully might have found their way down there. ",Classic
8894, I know. But it is late. Perhaps they've taken another route? ,Classic
140331," No. Show me the Eye of Orion, please. ",Classic
39210," Yes, sir. ",Classic
141799," Inside, checking the sync circuit. ",Classic
102922," Where have you been? Get that instrument package. Well, come on, get a move on. I've got to launch it before the hatches are locked.   Did you hear what I said? ",Classic
92829, It might have been the best thing. ,Classic
104898, I thought perhaps they might do things at dawn. ,Classic
46464," Yes, well, we'd better question Evans carefully when he gets back. ",Classic
76453," How very convenient for you. Now look, are you going to search for Miss Grant or not? ",Classic
8112," Oh, and congratulations. ",Classic
95791, Search them both. ,Classic
96606," Let's go, Sarah. ",Classic
99851, Just as we're now certain that he's plotting to kill Giuliano. ,Classic
50238, I suppose that does add a little zest. ,Classic
92988, It's rocking. ,Classic
56567," No, sir. As soon as Miss Kelly was transmitted the emergency link switched off again. ",Classic
83863, You are. ,Classic
83997," Stop winding, I said!   Quickly, man, quickly! ",Classic
88433, Are you coming? ,Classic
26085," Okay Mister, make with the piana'. ",Classic
26937," Oh, and what might that be? ",Classic
66169," Yes, it doesn't seem to be working. ",Classic
156582, Is it? ,Classic
103174, What are you talking about? ,Classic
146828, Our memories. ,Classic
55408, You got my message? ,Classic
137833, This man also is in the Tardis. ,Classic
132568," Where's the Indian? There was an Indian. I showed you the body of a man in there. A man of about thirty, in a white coat. A short white coat. You said he was a servant. ",Classic
112916," Standing around all day looking tough must be very wearing on the nerves, hmm?   I said, standing around all day looking tough must be very wearing on the nerves!   Long hours, violence, no intellectual stimulation. ",Classic
77160, The one you use in the transfer system? ,Classic
116646, I can't bear it. I love you. ,Classic
90680, Om. Om. Om. ,Classic
36266," But Doctor, what will they do to you? ",Classic
150607," Of course I can, but you will need proper clothes. ",Classic
76073," Very well. This time we'll continue the attack until those creatures are finally destroyed. Now, how about some tea?",Classic
36871," Polly, hold that in front of your mouth. ",Classic
82350," My dear Miss Grant, in the climate of opinion that I have created, do you think that any Earthman is going to believe the word of a Draconian?",Classic
114002, What? ,Classic
33548, Well? ,Classic
20435, Wait and see. There's time yet and mark my words that horse will be the doom of Troy. ,Classic
19887, Sound the trumpets! Dismiss! ,Classic
79387," Yes, it is, sir. It's the first one. ",Classic
91165, He became unbalanced. ,Classic
126408, Shush! ,Classic
43002, This is no time for debates. ,Classic
12606," Yes, this is Rome. How are you feeling? Are you more comfortable now? ",Classic
92249," Oh well, I never liked it here anyway. ",Classic
139827," Father, do not dishonour me. ",Classic
98637," An obvious question. I wish I knew the answer. Possibly their planet of origin is turbulent from time to time, any internal explosions could cause surface matter to go shooting into space. ",Classic
38170," You should have been watching him. Send for a new unit. You haven't averted your fate, only postponed it.  At last. Now, Doctor. ",Classic
50954," Patience, young man. Doctor, what in your opinion do this Dominators want? ",Classic
149211," Well, push where? ",Classic
48052, I'm asking you to destroy this evil that's in the sea before it's too late. Bomb the rigs. I implore you. ,Classic
73658, Very well. There was one curious thing. The girl referred to a companion in her own time zone. She called him the Doctor. ,Classic
58964," Hey, Dom. This must be it. These screw heads have been loosened recently. ",Classic
137768, He must be here somewhere. ,Classic
82999, Doctor? ,Classic
112376," Well, that's it, Garron. We'll have to go straight now. ",Classic
110397," Yes, send them back to the city before they bring their guards on us. ",Classic
29738," Well, about what? We've got no ties here. ",Classic
85009," The time will come. Thank you for your most valuable advice, Mister Yates. ",Classic
96152," You and I are scientists, Professor. We buy our privilege to experiment at the cost of total responsibility. ",Classic
80506, Queensbury rules? ,Classic
4092, The trade caravan to Shang-Tu. ,Classic
116973," Here's something.   Look, this is hers. ",Classic
31424, You were astounded? ,Classic
66556, Stahlman hit me? ,Classic
139979, When it pleases you. ,Classic
131657," No. Well, er, we'll try modifying the sonic booster in the Tardis. If we connect it to a frequency accelerator ",Classic
67817," It certainly doesn't sound like my Rex. Oh well, I'll go make the coffee. ",Classic
65587," Yes, General. I understand.   Please release that gentleman.   Right, Mister Cornish, we've got to get a message up to that alien space ship and tell them that their ambassadors are safe and well. ",Classic
37024," Yes, sir. When you've found your passport. The next one, please. ",Classic
9811," Why do you think a high-ranking official like myself came to Paris, hmm? I was part of the plan. I came to make sure of Robespierre's downfall. ",Classic
82314, Let me go! ,Classic
67469, Thank you. ,Classic
137892," Do not be afraid. When the moment comes, we will all share in the life force of the Doctor. ",Classic
96334, But this one did. ,Classic
164057, Police? ,Classic
23650, Is Bondeaux prepared? ,Classic
13515, Peace? Is that why you attack? Where is your main force? ,Classic
99933, Just as far as the temple entrance. No further. ,Classic
152269, The second is for an unscheduled freighter. ,Classic
120722, She was going to kill me! ,Classic
109366, Yes. ,Classic
160839," Oh dear, what a nuisance. ",Classic
56686," Oh, now what do we do? ",Classic
51096," Nothing, except wait.",Classic
38439, Robert Bruce.,Classic
43560," I await your punishment, Commander. ",Classic
37495," Oh, to you, maybe. But one of those kids happens to be my brother. ",Classic
120483," I am programmed not to kill, except in self-defence. ",Classic
117782, Not ,Classic
53257, There's someone coming.   It's amazing. ,Classic
113327," No, Doctor, not whilst we have the psychic interference transmitter. ",Classic
103310, You filthy murderer! ,Classic
42717," Hmmm. Very well, don't believe me, but I still intend to find out. ",Classic
128028," Welcome. Time has changed little for either of us, Doctor. You continue to roam the universe, while we persist in our simple existence on this planet. ",Classic
159517," You'll have to be a bit more specific, Doctor.   But I don't think it would do any harm if you were to have just a quick look round. ",Classic
93120, Help! ,Classic
88223," Very well. The charges will be suspended and the aliens released into your custody, Ambassador. ",Classic
77711," That's all right, Prof. You go and enjoy your nosh. Leave it to the toiling masses. ",Classic
149898," It will, but we'll die from lack of air before we freeze to death. ",Classic
90026," Look, it's no good! If you go out there, they'll kill you both.",Classic
154713, What are you doing? ,Classic
155956," Of course. That was their cover, wasn't it. They knew that the Time Lords eventually would trace the leak. ",Classic
20545," Katarina. Katarina, this is the Doctor. Now, go and find the man you call Diomede. He's hiding amongst those pillars over there. ",Classic
120543," I know one thing, Doctor. It can't get out of this Pit by itself. Go on, Karela. Hold him, in case he tries to warn his creeping friend. Dog! ",Classic
136834," Well, first the Great Snake is taken in procession through the streets before going up to the cave. ",Classic
70883," Foolishly? Dent, is that all you've got to say? ",Classic
148242," When will this be, Chief Officer? ",Classic
43744," Which law? Whose philosophies, eh? ",Classic
151146, Maylin Tekker. ,Classic
126871," It's baleful influence will not extend beyond the grove, and even here it will only produce a few weeds. Like others before it, the creature will calcify and pass harmlessly into the soil. But the demise of any living thing is painful to us. ",Classic
40278, He's mad! ,Classic
77760," You've lost me, Doctor Ingram. ",Classic
62681," Now there you may have something. Could be sabotage, I suppose. ",Classic
510, They have gone into the night. ,Classic
114353, Where is your authorisation? ,Classic
158030," Yes, it is serious. I don't seem to have any change. Er, take five credits from the kitty, Mel. ",Classic
31088, The humans are behind the door. Let the gas do its work. ,Classic
70291, Jo! ,Classic
111622," That appeal was rejected! After all I had done for the Alliance, not a word was said in my favour, not a single hand raised in my support! ",Classic
36272," It's a very difficult case, I'm afraid. Nothing much we can do. He's too far gone to help. No, he'll never be happy like the rest of us. All we can do is send him to the pits for life. ",Classic
128483, You're quite right. One mistake now could ruin everything. ,Classic
36197, I never heard a voice like this before. Ben? ,Classic
52497," You're not really going to do as he says, are you? ",Classic
41137, Come along. ,Classic
150410, That noise you heard was a spacecraft landing. That hacienda is now in the possession of what you would term as alien beings. ,Classic
127018, It seems they have indeed been lying to us. ,Classic
82663, Thank you. I was beginning to think that I'd never find anybody to help me. ,Classic
146472," My ship. My ship. Oh, no. No.   What have they done with it? ",Classic
131540, No. There's something wrong. I can feel it. ,Classic
65290, Like robbing Fort Knox? ,Classic
142712," Oh, systems that could rebuild a civilisation for us. Failure-proof technology. ",Classic
68690," It's all a bit of a blank, I'm afraid. Do you know, you wouldn't believe this, but I couldn't even remember me own name. Not until the Doctor there told me. ",Classic
112550, Pralix. ,Classic
95618," We're still in a solar system, but what particular star provides the light and energy? Wherever we are, we're a long way out.",Classic
63934," Doctor, what do you think you're doing? ",Classic
119558, Us? ,Classic
158918," Personally, I find most experiences border on the existential. ",Classic
147919, Controller.   The Cyberman guarding the Doctor does not respond. ,Classic
139934, Then what do you here? ,Classic
41428," Run, Miss Victoria! Run! Fetch Khrisong. ",Classic
33128," Aye, he used that to trick me with, but he won't get far. Perkins, summon the watch! And you, get those prisoners aboard before the soldiers get here. ",Classic
145573," Your sense of humour will be the death of you, Doctor. Probably quite soon. ",Classic
71088," Procedures, nothing, Robert. This planet's ours and the sooner you're off it, the better. ",Classic
54893, I don't know. There's a ramp here. ,Classic
31336," But good heavens above, man. ",Classic
118699, It has been done. A deep space cruiser is on its way. ,Classic
107037," Hey, now, just a minute. ",Classic
150185, Doctor. ,Classic
119418, Split up. We'll meet back at the cafe. ,Classic
70770, Long way from here. ,Classic
19022," Look, listen to us! ",Classic
20781, Inform base security that a further intruder craft has been located. ,Classic
137333," Mathematics. Oh, I know how many beans make five, Doctor, and you don't have to be a Time Lord to cope with A level maths. It may come as a surprise to you, but I also happen to like teaching. ",Classic
14662, You do not know El Akir. ,Classic
141494, All is prepared. ,Classic
85367, Mmm hmm. ,Classic
81164," Well, two things I hope. It'll enable me to get Jo out of here in time, and get her out of this wretched contraption, and it will return all the other lifeforms to their original space time coordinates. ",Classic
77814, He was. ,Classic
40222, You obviously knew what to expect. ,Classic
37056, Thank you. ,Classic
101346, I know him. ,Classic
49930," Well, yes. No! Doctor Corwyn. Oh Doctor. Och.",Classic
60863, Very well. ,Classic
161285, There's no alternative. ,Classic
66821," Well, what do we do now? ",Classic
77238, And the Marshal? ,Classic
21443, Projection seven alpha zero sero zeta. Instruments register perfect dissemination. ,Classic
23319," Don't worry. Antoine, bring another glass. ",Classic
33265, Where is he? ,Classic
143923, Any one want some tea? ,Classic
49500," Yes, it's a pity you didn't tell somebody sooner. ",Classic
16437," Vicki! Vicki, quickly! ",Classic
94331, Now what? ,Classic
74997," I never carry the things. A lot of bureaucratic nonsense. If you wish to see my pass, then ask Miss Grant.",Classic
25102," Only as long as you have the Doctor. After that, we'll see ",Classic
138945," Yeah, but he stands to make a packet, I dare say, if we win. ",Classic
11596,   You'll have to move. They're clearing this whole section. ,Classic
130281," Oh, you're not eating. ",Classic
161069, Why? ,Classic
162052, We're not alone. ,Classic
27073, He had one of the savages with him. A girl. She seemed to be moving along in a light that shone from one of those guns they carry. ,Classic
95940, The oculoid picture. Look!   Cut the forcefield. ,Classic
98541, What's his body temperature? ,Classic
78399," It is my job, remember? ",Classic
86183, Why? ,Classic
117681," Well, they were coming after us, but K9 chased them away. ",Classic
76154, ASkybase. ,Classic
108802," I wish you could stay, Doctor. There is much to do. ",Classic
124762," To keep an eye on the Starliner, of course. ",Classic
156126," You are dead, Doctor. ",Classic
87750, I haven't liked any of it so far. ,Classic
61789, You know where one landed? ,Classic
27198," All these instruments, that big glass thing, and those huge bottles. What do they do here? ",Classic
56610," Don't worry, Jamie. I'm sure we're going to be all right. ",Classic
110482, There is no choice. ,Classic
82336, This is Earth battle cruiser X two nine. Do you read me? Identify yourself. This is Earth battle cruiser X two nine. Do you read me? Identify yourself. ,Classic
109045," Pacified? Who did it, hmm? Who did it? I'll kill them. I'll kill them! It was him, wasn't it?   ",Classic
31729," It's all right, Polly. ",Classic
26988, Did the Doctor not tell you? ,Classic
137330," When did you leave UNIT, Brigadier? ",Classic
82281," What will you do, Master? ",Classic
109559, Can it be done? ,Classic
102241, How was the battle? ,Classic
361, I must find him. ,Classic
29347, And I'll have the ears of any man who thinks he'll land me before a judge. ,Classic
120689," Is this true, my lady? ",Classic
156540, No! It's too soon. ,Classic
25140," Oh, but, now that the Fool is here, don't you think we could have a joke or two? ",Classic
25700," Doctor, I offer you power. Power to corrupt, to destroy. Think of the exhilaration of that power. Serve me and live. ",Classic
119129, What's Scarlioni's angle? ,Classic
139960," I know not. He has never favoured Frenchmen before this, even renegades from the King of France. ",Classic
126472, That's something. ,Classic
5509, And do you know where it is now? ,Classic
7808, Good. ,Classic
78467, Old women? ,Classic
149867, Mainly decaying food   and corpses. ,Classic
78838, What is it? ,Classic
116974, Then she was here. ,Classic
28151," No, no. Good heavens, I must be off. I'm late. Thank you, Major.",Classic
103580, It is hurrying. ,Classic
72218, Fuss? I've never heard such balderdash in all ,Classic
51280," All clear.   Oh no, Quarks again. They must be all over the place. Hey, I wonder how many there are? ",Classic
33929," Well, girl, what do you want? Why are you not at your work? ",Classic
70676, What do you mean? ,Classic
89906," No, my sisters haven't the power, you remember. The crystal must still be on Earth. ",Classic
121839," All personnel locate and apprehend passenger Tryst and pilot Dymond. They may try to leave the ship. And with reference to the previous order regarding the Doctor, cancel it. ",Classic
158967, We've got no right to kill. ,Classic
101717, What do you want of me? ,Classic
65333, It could be a blind to make us think he'd been kidnapped. ,Classic
109273, Tunnel nine is being cleared for fumigation. Officer Klimt?   Officer Klimt! Officer Klimt! ,Classic
108582," You told the Collector, too! That fish-blooded sadist had Leela's casket wired for sound. ",Classic
65515, You must speed it up. Get on to your people. This is an emergency. ,Classic
74777, Name dropper.   Oh! ,Classic
105057," Oh, no, no, no, no. One lump for ladies. ",Classic
82179, You will address the Emperor in a proper manner! ,Classic
44785, You're only making trouble for yourself. Killing me won't get you anywhere. ,Classic
153031," Oh. Yes, of course. ",Classic
121764, This way. The Doctor has just come aboard. ,Classic
94486, Take care. ,Classic
117325," You are not dealing with a fool, Doctor. ",Classic
39441," No, wait a minute. Eighty nine, eighty eight, eighty seven. Just about a minute, that's all we've got. ",Classic
162522, Funny you should say that. ,Classic
97541, Give me a pen.,Classic
99367," Consider me available for any future assignments, Sir Colin. ",Classic
148784, Thank you. Goodbye. ,Classic
7047," Well, from the size of our stocks, they've obviously been giving us their own food. ",Classic
103065, Please wait here. ,Classic
20656," It's not for another twenty minutes. Well, what about 403? ",Classic
8916," Susan, I think the horse has thrown a shoe. The moment they start to unhitch it, we'll make a run for it. ",Classic
136115, I'm outside. I'm being fed this image. ,Classic
30972," Let me handle this, my boy! ",Classic
36374, The strangers are being sent to you for pit labour. Put them in the Danger Gang. ,Classic
79143," A flash, yes, not an explosion. It was a release of kinetic energy. ",Classic
59273, Well what about her? ,Classic
81997, If you'll excuse me. One of our little prison rituals. ,Classic
153567, He hasn't bunked off. He's gone down there. ,Classic
60807," Doctor, now what? ",Classic
70881," They found me. They started shooting. What was I supposed to do, let myself get killed? ",Classic
32677, I know not. They're no Scot. They threw down the Prince's cockade. ,Classic
138129, Are you all right? I found the doorway to the Tardis. ,Classic
154995, I've already told you. ,Classic
80589," Come on, get yourself up. Come on, give us your hand. Come on, up. There. Here, mop yourself down with this. ",Classic
163786, Fascinating moths. ,Classic
100657," I've just got a few things to sort out up here. Well done, Doctor. Attention all staff, attention all staff. The reactor is now under control, so return to your posts. Video maintenance, check the monitoring of that reactor room, would you please? ",Classic
29191," Don't come the innocent with us, sawbones. You know what Joe was hiding. ",Classic
114823," I'm a knight, not a farrier. ",Classic
83876," Well, just try standing still, my love, eh? Tell us the dreadful news. You've come to join us, right? ",Classic
24201," Yeah, Noah's ark. You know, two by two. The flood. ",Classic
92929," You, Doctor, are a special case. You enjoy the freedom we allow you. In return, occasionally, not continually, we ask you to do something for us. ",Classic
120661, I was overpowered by the wolfweeds. ,Classic
119185, Yes. ,Classic
73954," Well, you told us yourself. You're an old enemy of the Daleks. ",Classic
20446, Do you think he's in it? ,Classic
49914, Presumably these Cybermen disposed of the crewmembers of the rocket in space? ,Classic
134590, In all my years in a flight engineer I have never seen anything like ,Classic
79196, Fire at will! ,Classic
98047, Did Maren send you to destroy me? ,Classic
150440, This injection will simply inhibit the motor centres. ,Classic
53869, Your commands. ,Classic
160928, Keep playing. Enjoy yourself. ,Classic
33752, What's happening now? ,Classic
145166, That's right. ,Classic
24497," These strangers, they ",Classic
154693," Well, I'd prefer it if you'd use somebody else. ",Classic
99145," Take a seat, Doctor.   You see our little machine, Doctor? ",Classic
41826," Well, that's the object of the exercise. To get us away from the monastery. But I'm not beaten that easily. ",Classic
85770, The Tardis? ,Classic
98857," No, we checked that an hour ago. ",Classic
44788," All right, Bruce, we might have just thirty seconds but you'd have exactly half that time, if you were lucky! ",Classic
5690, He's gone too. ,Classic
66311, Of all the ungrateful nitwits!,Classic
48744, Just hold on! ,Classic
146554, The safe house. I set it to self-destruct. ,Classic
56524," Oh dear, this is most unfortunate. ",Classic
159260," There's no point, Mel. No point hanging around wasting time. ",Classic
137998, I'm going to tell the Doctor about the roundel. ,Classic
321, It doesn't go anywhere. It just happens and then it's finished. ,Classic
137653," And the Brigadier, but I've lost both of them. ",Classic
103684, You mean you didn't know? I thought that's why we came here. ,Classic
101590, Horrible. Horrible. ,Classic
14199, The belt. Get the belt. ,Classic
34210, How will he destroy us? ,Classic
160050, Huh? Daleks! Move it! ,Classic
46139," Yes. Yes, that should work. ",Classic
42464, How did it happen? ,Classic
45338," All right. But I warned you, Julius, I warned you. ",Classic
81430, Yes. ,Classic
20611, Not Vicki? ,Classic
158553," Snipers, forward! Kill them! On the roof! ",Classic
96252," No, Doctor, don't! Whatever it was, I know it was totally malevolent. ",Classic
125255," Well, it might be quite nice here. ",Classic
151818," Oh, Doctor. ",Classic
21170," There. Doctor, something moved. ",Classic
34338," Not in this world, Doctor.   As always, there is nothing to worry about. ",Classic
74329," But you have Hepesh. He seems very fond of you, just like a father.",Classic
117276, But you promised. You promised me victory. ,Classic
123861," Well done, Romana. Well done. You're becoming very accomplished at all this. ",Classic
146755," Now, that's enough, Doctor. ",Classic
164925, No. No! ,Classic
62352, Humans are not predictable. It is growing difficult to maintain control over Hibbert. ,Classic
51266, Command accepted. ,Classic
112032, Is he dead? ,Classic
77358, That's a lie! Where's your evidence? ,Classic
127938, This place is unreal. ,Classic
86941, Would you two like a cup of tea? I've become quite an expert. ,Classic
24747," Oh, thank heaven, Steven, my boy, you're safe. Now listen. The Ark is about to blow up! ",Classic
98797," Who, Wolfgang Amadeus? Oh, him. Oh, he died. ",Classic
164213, It is not his to give. ,Classic
8730, Are we to be allowed to tell our story? ,Classic
139330," No! I don't want to go up there. Look, I'll tell you what's going on below decks with the Ephemerals. It's mutiny! I'll give you something ",Classic
131655," Well, there's nothing we can do now until we've dealt with the android. ",Classic
134587, Not exactly. ,Classic
94312," This way.   Sorry, old girl, dead end. Back we go. ",Classic
7288, I don't know. Let's find out. Needn't come if you don't want to. ,Classic
66904," Professor Stahlman, I have made innumerable attempts to secure a few moments of your valuable time. You've left me no choice. ",Classic
127791," That's what I just said. What a landing. No, no, no, no. Don't open the door. ",Classic
116435, Are you refusing to obey orders? ,Classic
70796," Colonists? According to Earth Control, this planet hasn't been colonised. ",Classic
129694," I have heard enough blasphemy for one day. If it weren't for me, you'd still believe your Earth is flat. Now hold your tongue! This Doctor will know about us when I know more about him. Now leave us! ",Classic
155850, No! ,Classic
133072, I hope you're right. ,Classic
72590," That's right. Mind you, when it landed it was two hundred feet long and thirty feet across. But they diminished it, just as they diminished themselves, which accounts for the heat wave and the freeze-up. ",Classic
158020," You saved my life, Chima. I'm sorry. ",Classic
131218," Well, you did for a while, but no longer. ",Classic
20737, His what? ,Classic
53456, All right. ,Classic
79801," Well, the trouble is, we're not sure we can. ",Classic
87874, On the walls of a temple in Peru. ,Classic
6761, How can it be prevented if it is the will of the gods. ,Classic
112239," Yeah, but first things first, Garron. ",Classic
91852," There are three of them. Another male called the Doctor, and that female. They say she was irradiated by error. ",Classic
79381, It's all right. I think it was just hiccups. Fascinating. ,Classic
120571," Yes, you. Go down to the passage, into the cave, and come back and tell us what you see. ",Classic
137056, The Brigadier's car. ,Classic
112663, Huh. He makes us his fools. ,Classic
17073," I don't want to know! I want none of this! I've never heard such nonsense in my life! You'll end up as a couple of burnt cinders, flying around in space. You idiots! You are absolute idiots! ",Classic
72098," Come on, Jo. ",Classic
41585, Miss Victoria?   Miss Victoria. ,Classic
157637," Don't just stand there, help me! Help!   You arrived just in time. ",Classic
4008, Yes. ,Classic
124960, I repeat. I am beginning surgery. ,Classic
21931, Do I take it that you gentlemen are imputing that I am mentally deranged? ,Classic
158414," Stop, stop. Stop! Stop! He's not following us. ",Classic
69897," Doctor, I wasn't imagining things. I tell you I heard Bill Filer's voice!",Classic
81614," Then they need to plant human agents, traitors, on this planet to sabotage our war effort. ",Classic
140073, That's not true! ,Classic
129303, What's that when it's at home? ,Classic
78046," Right, sir. ",Classic
134899," As far as I can tell. Not a bad landing, Skipper. ",Classic
66787, How long have we got? ,Classic
38551, Edward Waterfield. Genuine Victoriana. ,Classic
21406, Run for it! ,Classic
13565," So relentless, indestructible. What are we going to do? Have you got any ideas? ",Classic
82124," You'd better hold on again, you two in there. Doctor, Miss Grant, I'm going to make rather a sharp course correction.",Classic
114223," Correction, master. Circuits will burn out after thirty one point two seven seconds. ",Classic
131859, What happened?,Classic
118999," The next one, Count? Well ",Classic
139601, Then what were you doing in the grid room? ,Classic
53491," No, no, it's the lift that's stuck, not us. Look. ",Classic
93918," Of course I will. Thank you.   You knew that was going to happen, didn't you.   He's dead. Been dead some time. ",Classic
157601," Are you feeling better now, dear? ",Classic
50002," No, I can't find them. ",Classic
96308, To say what? That a foreigner is living in Professor Scarman's house? ,Classic
31964, One Dalek in Bragen's office. Three Daleks just gone down the corridors. That makes four. ,Classic
110740," What do you mean, master? ",Classic
35014, There's something about this epidemic that I don't quite understand. It's not like a real disease at all. It's almost as if ,Classic
132233, How do you do? What enchanting names. ,Classic
39492, Exterminate. Destroy. ,Classic
63319," The Doctor is supposed to be brilliant, in his own way. He may be a little eccentric. ",Classic
161635, Good. We're ready for anything. ,Classic
140122, But why do you serve this imposter king? ,Classic
79264," How do you do, my dear fellow. ",Classic
147694,   Nothing much. ,Classic
53873, I must. Your commands. ,Classic
45614," Hello, HQ to Holborn? ",Classic
79245," You can't allow him to cross his own time stream. Apart from the enormous energy it would need, the First Law of Time expressly forbids him to meet his other selves. ",Classic
28550," Yeah, I'm all right. ",Classic
139631," I told you, I like to be on the winning side. ",Classic
29111," And how do you know all this, sir? ",Classic
112281," Deeper, deeper, and even deeper. ",Classic
35691, Well? ,Classic
147621, What are you trying to do? ,Classic
100264, Good. Now the coat. I don't want this to show. Thank you.   How do I look? ,Classic
69031, I know! We can ,Classic
111235, Workshop? ,Classic
82371, Naturally we sent a cruiser. How else should a nobleman of Draconia travel? But its missile banks were empty. The ship was unarmed.,Classic
149862, What? ,Classic
99048, It's happening. ,Classic
103983," Very well.   Can I have paper and pencil, please, Sergeant? ",Classic
134897, Fractured brake line. ,Classic
127767," Well, it's an early version. The instructions have to be punched in by machine code. ",Classic
4353," Yes, there is to be a banquet tonight in his honour, at which six thousand guests will attend. ",Classic
97014, I'm asking the questions and I have the gun. ,Classic
131633," Nonsense, sir. That glow is a conjuring trick. I'm a man of the theatre. I'm not impressed by trickery, however clever it is. ",Classic
76921, Hmm? ,Classic
132248, I beg your pardon? ,Classic
135529, Who are you? ,Classic
156355," Indeed I am. And were there such a thing as an intergalactic postal vote, you'd have mine. ",Classic
41322, Far better if the Yeti had not been brought into the monastery. ,Classic
133698, Their combined forces would be too great. ,Classic
159085, And what do you think a standard non-terrestrial looks like? ,Classic
106528," Right. K9, you destroy the shaft and meet me in the corridor. ",Classic
156318, A maser? ,Classic
19832, Oh? Then perhaps they are sleeping with a knife between their ribs. Shall we go seek them together? ,Classic
120193, Thank you. Thank you. And thank you for saving me from that creature. ,Classic
6418, Don't tell me you're my friend now. ,Classic
52873," Isobel. Yeah. Now, just stand here. Head over the shoulder. ",Classic
77888," This man, Thascales, is a dangerous criminal and an escaped prisoner. Sufficient grounds? ",Classic
79362, Hard luck. ,Classic
157065, He's someone important? ,Classic
114693," Delayed? Oh, I wouldn't bother about that, if I were you.   Bye, bye. Happy journey! ",Classic
716," He said, Kal is not stronger than the whole tribe. ",Classic
27755," The strangers? Oh yes. Yes, instruct BPatrol to make ready. ",Classic
134086, I saw Concorde once on the tarmac at Melbourne. ,Classic
32258," Oh, leave her alone, Kebble. She isn't doing any harm. ",Classic
49236," Confirm Zoe's figures on radar computers two and five. You didn't let yourself know what you're letting yourself in for, did you? Have you ever been in a sky station when a meteorite hits? ",Classic
73080," Well? You waste time. I order you to kill him, Azal! ",Classic
79644," Well, they won't hold us long in here. Not in a cell without a door. ",Classic
158439," Who will stop me? You, with your puny flag and your appeals to fair play and justice, huh? I spit on your justice. ",Classic
99292, Block the door. ,Classic
94141," Doctor, she's not going to last much longer. ",Classic
106100, What was that? ,Classic
86928, I'm afraid not. We went through the files together. The place was planned but it was never built. ,Classic
67435, The Brigadier's an idiot! I knew I should have destroyed that thing but somehow it would have felt like murder. ,Classic
60961, Then I go. ,Classic
138726," Doctor, say you're pleased to see her. ",Classic
62775, To scare people away? ,Classic
100507, Did you find anything at the quarry? ,Classic
31056," Don't mean it's going to blow up, do you? ",Classic
70461, That's simple. Because you are winning. And we have a proposition. You may have conquered this tiny speck in space but you've yet to conquer time. ,Classic
45789," Yeah. Nothing hardly touches them, does it? ",Classic
80651,"   We haven't got one, have we? ",Classic
46500," Look, sir! ",Classic
40635, I told you to watch that door. ,Classic
164188, Control is me. ,Classic
150990," You're afraid, aren't you. Afraid of some power-crazed old man. That's all he is. ",Classic
34442, Wait a minute. Something's gone wrong. Where's Zaroff? ,Classic
110570," In the name of liberty and honour, I sentence you to death, traitor. ",Classic
41599," We had no defence against it, yet it just walked through the gates. Doctor, we must act quickly or the Abbot will prevent us. ",Classic
69432," Yes. Rather an effective disguise, don't you think? ",Classic
105468," Not after what I've seen tonight, and that's flat. ",Classic
151855," I'm sorry, Mister Jobel. ",Classic
79204," Get the men out, Benton. Complete evacuation, then report to me in the laboratory. Is that clear? Over. ",Classic
159558, More Daleks. ,Classic
74689, But it would have made a magnificent coronation. ,Classic
144634, What makes you think that? ,Classic
74828, That's it over there. ,Classic
126015," By the time the Tower falls, the Great One will have arisen. We shall be invincible. ",Classic
145357," Doctor, we've got about an hour to live. That Morgus wants us dead. ",Classic
115658, What's the matter with you. ,Classic
42146, And then the glaciers will move again. Five thousand years of history crushed beneath a moving mountain of ice. ,Classic
31085, Come in and get it!   There's something else down by the door.   Now! ,Classic
74379, What are you suggesting? I reject the accusation. ,Classic
46960, How you managed to exist all this time. Why didn't the Yetis get you? ,Classic
70183, We have explored the blocks the Time Lords have imposed upon your memory and can free them. We must have the secret of time travel. ,Classic
118656, Exterminate the prisoners. ,Classic
9307," If anyone can find him, Jean can. Now to our problem. I wonder who can help us? ",Classic
14556, You did. You did steal from me. ,Classic
77319," And further, that these experiments were the root cause of the outbreak of mutation. Well? ",Classic
10223," Hey, Barbara. Look at this. ",Classic
5364, The dead man could have hit you before he was killed. ,Classic
31980, Then I shall have them destroyed. It's too dangerous. The Examiner knows something about them that we don't. I'm going to ask his advice. ,Classic
119875," Insufficient data, master, but there is no fault in the equipment. ",Classic
88940, It's been conceived by the Doctor. He has fought the Ice Warriors before. ,Classic
43235," No, but of your ship. If the ioniser sets off a nuclear holocaust, it will all have be in vain. ",Classic
130688, I don't believe it. This is impossible. ,Classic
30547, But you can't calmly stand there and tell us we're all going to die! ,Classic
121142, Then why have you switched it off? ,Classic
3023," The war is over, my lord. Noghai has sued for peace and Tegana travels to Kublai's court to discuss the armistice plans. ",Classic
149455, Rest? ,Classic
136262, Look now.   ,Classic
132418, Sir. ,Classic
76531, Is it weapons? ,Classic
112730," No, I don't want any part of this madness. I don't want to hear Mentiads, guards, madness. ",Classic
133619, That's very clever. ,Classic
125999," The others have gone, therefore the ceremony must have started. Now listen to me, all of you. I want you to hold this Tower until K9 gives the signal. ",Classic
27151," No, no, no!",Classic
143444, I will have it! ,Classic
106980," Ah. Look, it's there, Stael. If we can get a visual representation of this area here, then we shall see the living owner of that skull. ",Classic
28770, Now! ,Classic
153511, I've got to get after them. ,Classic
18132," Oh, Doctor, you're all right! ",Classic
82506," Yes, they should be here very soon now. Judging by the size of the ship, they can't be in any great force. So conceal yourselves and ambush them as soon as they arrive. Right?   Hold on, wait a minute. Something's happened. They must have landed very nearby. Right, send out patrols! Get them and bring them back here immediately. And remember, I want the Doctor alive. ",Classic
36053, Who else knows I'm here? ,Classic
28339, This is your blueprint. It must be followed in every detail. The outer sections are to be constructed at once. The electronic section must be assembled in this order. ,Classic
21194, I am. ,Classic
98187," I do not yet have the Time Lord's head, master. ",Classic
37047," Well, thank you. ",Classic
23811, Monsieur! ,Classic
105000," Doctor, I offer you a proposition. ",Classic
103427," Dask, what is it? ",Classic
55690, Feed in emergency power. Gravitation feed check. ,Classic
62407, Take cover! Fire!   Fall back! ,Classic
58935, What are you doing? ,Classic
129926," He's now in the Flora chamber, and I saw Bigon with him. ",Classic
3630, The following evening will even be better. ,Classic
50923," Oh, we wouldn't stand a chance. These Quarks are deadly. ",Classic
97935," Come on, let's follow them. They must know the way. ",Classic
95331," Load!   Standing by, sir. ",Classic
50724," You question my report, Navigator Rago? ",Classic
107708, And then there's the recycling allowance on his death weight of eighty four kilos. That is eight talmars. Leaving a debt of a hundred and seventeen. ,Classic
48950, The static. There's a signal on it. ,Classic
26070," You heard what she said, I reckon you'd better. ",Classic
49114," Exactly. In space training even for one journey travellers. He asked me for a drink of water and then he left it. He might have been on Earth. That boy's has no space travel training, Jarvis. He's probably a stowaway, or he may be an agent. ",Classic
64710," You're not armed, I hope? ",Classic
24417, I'm going to treat the others precisely the same way as I've treated Steven. ,Classic
96770, One to one. They answer to you alone. ,Classic
84968, Good. How have you been programmed? ,Classic
34945, Was it a bad year then? ,Classic
499," If I stop her from killing them, they will give fire to me. And not to Kal. The woman could not have got into the cave. The great stone is still there. Why do you tell me this? ",Classic
150046," Over that hill. Do you know, in the old days when my mother worked for the Don it was like a palace. Now it is falling down.",Classic
23140," Don't mock me, Nicholas. I'm in France to protect my master, Henri of Navarre, just as you are to protect de Coligny. ",Classic
1043," Yes, ample, ample. ",Classic
22935, Bring them in. ,Classic
105941, How did you hold it back on the stairs? ,Classic
137534, Come on. There isn't a moment to lose. ,Classic
129908, You know? ,Classic
123917," Well, Lexa? ",Classic
78219," Right, nearly there. ",Classic
120188," No, I'm simply telling you that everything you want to know is locked up in K9's memory banks. Damage them and you won't learn a thing. ",Classic
151972," I'm sorry, Mister Jobel. ",Classic
109122, It's either that or we're stuck here for the rest of eternity. We'll try it. Herrick? ,Classic
68533," Yes, maybe, but nevertheless it's dangerous and it should be destroyed now! ",Classic
56412," Trajectory bearings, orbital lock. ",Classic
53476, What will that do? ,Classic
79642," They will not be harmed, Doctor. They have no part in my revenge.   I have been grievously wronged, Doctor, and now it is time for my vengeance! ",Classic
5396, How did you get here?   ,Classic
20225, Just admiring the view. It's a very handsome square out here. ,Classic
24635, Because he's one of the subject Guardians. What you'd call a collaborator. ,Classic
11540," Yes. Yes, we are. ",Classic
107347, What is it? ,Classic
62373," Channing is controlling your mind. You must resist him. Channing is your enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy. ",Classic
161873," That's true. But then, how do they expect a hard case like him to going to the circus anyway? ",Classic
49715," I'll quarter the room off. Over there, in the direction of ",Classic
49301," Well, just a little. ",Classic
155433, Part Eleven,Classic
160055, Ace told me. ,Classic
152187, I don't understand. ,Classic
50904," As far as we know, she left with my son Cully. Presumably they have returned to the island. ",Classic
67158, How on earth did he know? ,Classic
89930, Cellar. ,Classic
155775, Maybe we lack your divine insight. ,Classic
86747, It's a nasty bump. Nothing too serious. How do you feel? ,Classic
120228, I should say so. Was she frightened of you? ,Classic
142085, Don't touch me! Get off! ,Classic
128026,   Where's here? ,Classic
118974, Pity. I wonder what he thought I looked like? ,Classic
79972, Nobble him? You're talking about one of the most powerful blokes in the cosmos. Nobble him? ,Classic
84375," Yes, I certainly can. ",Classic
128722, But how will it help to change the Tardis rooms around? ,Classic
124932, You're very loyal to him. ,Classic
67195, Seems to be. ,Classic
105823, Harker? ,Classic
73363," No, nothing at all.  (Apart from two UNIT soldiers patrolling the tow path getting zapped into nothing by Shura.",Classic
155520, Well? ,Classic
116092," Harg here, Dugeen. You're needed in Control. ",Classic
63439, It's a remarkable accumulation of evidence. ,Classic
148225," Let me see. Yes, we might. We'll try. Hold that. ",Classic
104118," Aren't you coming, Mister Jago? ",Classic
25382, Only it's a key. And a rather large one at that. ,Classic
56960, Why haven't the pods arrived in any warm areas? ,Classic
58393," We're running our heads into a trap, Caven. The Space Corp cruiser is less than three hours away, and on a convergent course. ",Classic
9328, I'll arrange for a carriage to take them. ,Classic
120238, Our little nest egg. ,Classic
42262," Well, a second out. We can't all be perfect. ",Classic
106014, Yes. ,Classic
22277," Ah, tut, tut, tut, my dear Monk. Now don't be so ridiculous. Put that down at once. ",Classic
116118, Like prodding a sleeping tiger. ,Classic
76345, Is he reliable? ,Classic
63836, Sir! ,Classic
112506, Won't make a scrap of difference. ,Classic
143711, Quiet. ,Classic
137400," Mind you, I'd better check, because I'm a new boy here myself.   Let's see. S. T. Trevor, Trumper, Turner. Nope. No, definitely no Turlough. ",Classic
98340, HCN. ,Classic
79140, Explosion? What explosion? I heard nothing. ,Classic
3659," Have you seen my clothing bag, Tegana? ",Classic
114623, Of what crime had the female humanoid been accused? ,Classic
47434," Well, who knows.",Classic
58369, What's the matter? ,Classic
117957," Fire!  (The pilot's hand reaches the firing button, then the whole lowering missiles cycle begins again.   Fire! ",Classic
152470, You've spent too many hours alone in this preparation room. Someone as impressionable as you should lavish a little more time on the living instead of fantasising with the dead. ,Classic
164433," If this is a top secret naval camp, then I'm Lord Nelson. ",Classic
93832, Doctor. ,Classic
89794, Will this give us power? ,Classic
90422, Hurry now. ,Classic
142695, Perhaps you could ask them to move. They're rather blocking the air. It's interesting. How often do you have meteorite showers? ,Classic
119088," Well, he's standing behind me poking a gun in my back. ",Classic
154087, Must you bring your lunch in here? ,Classic
145860, I know. ,Classic
80150," Yes. Yes, gaseous sulphides, low concentration. Nothing to worry about.",Classic
10564," Hmm, yes, they do sound alike, I must say that. Perhaps I had better go up there. ",Classic
6884," There's one thing about it, Doctor. We're certainly different from when we started out with you. ",Classic
99493, We'd better keep an eye open for that lunatic Chase. ,Classic
72586, And they first came to Earth nearly one hundred thousand years ago.,Classic
63553," Charles, please. ",Classic
12269, To save my life. I killed a crewmember on the spaceship to Astra. I was arrested. The ship crashed. My crime hadn't been radioed to Earth. I knew if I could get rid of the other crewmembers. ,Classic
134622," The time. Yes, that's another thing. ",Classic
30806, Doctor Barclay's going to help us. ,Classic
34554, Zaroff was having us on. ,Classic
161676," Oh. Now, let me see. Yes, there was a Dorothea. She died in sixteen ",Classic
83241, Doctor? What did you say to the Time Lords in your message? ,Classic
17995," Yes, but it cannot fly. The Rills shot us down. We cannot move. ",Classic
67149, No! Not entirely. I've just got used to your being around. ,Classic
7729, The Doctor may go away to fetch an army of human beings and a fleet of spaceships.  1 ,Classic
2082, Hmm? ,Classic
82089," Of course. Oh, and another thing. There's a closed circuit television camera trained on you from up there, so you will be under continuous observation. I think that's all. Well now, if you'll excuse me, I have some rather complicated astro-navigational calculations to work out. ",Classic
19797," If I am not a god, how do you account for my supernatural knowledge? ",Classic
136488, Yes. ,Classic
111060, What has happened? ,Classic
42555, My mouth's dry. ,Classic
130739," Culturally non-hostile, didn't you say?   Yes, we take the point, don't we. ",Classic
137735," Hello, Brigadier. ",Classic
130089," Ah, conformity. There is no other freedom. ",Classic
149138," You'd have been discovered eventually, you know, even without my intervention. ",Classic
115004, Farrah and I will take our swords and do battle with the Count's men. ,Classic
143299," But Cockerill, you're an Orderly. ",Classic
149325, Good luck to them. ,Classic
7599," Yes. Two, eight, seven. The disintegrator is beamed and ready. They are just entering the corridor to the reception room now. Impulses working correctly. They are just entering the reception room. This switch here turns on the beam. ",Classic
68128," That, Captain Yates, is what I'm trying to find out.",Classic
161348, Don't move! ,Classic
155872," Thank you, Keeper. Doctor, do you have any further evidence in your defence? ",Classic
19126," Perhaps, but if we were to agree that the Doctor and his friends could, what is the value in expelling them from the spaceship?",Classic
15845," My dear Chesterton, I don't think I have to ask your permission for what I take in my ship, and another thing, I will not have ",Classic
150859," No, After you. ",Classic
83152, It's going. ,Classic
139473, Shall we go? ,Classic
64853, That case you gave him. What was it? ,Classic
122502," Oh yes, of course, yes. ",Classic
94460, We were working together. We wanted to lure the Cybermen into a trap. ,Classic
55514," I mean, how would you like to die without knowing the reason, eh? ",Classic
137310, Liz Shaw. ,Classic
144924," Perhaps I should choose new elders from amongst the citizens, and a Chief Elder who would be more faithful to his new leader. ",Classic
26738, And supposin' we don't go? ,Classic
96891," Yes, it does have that peculiar earthy smell. Which is odd when you look at the ground. ",Classic
143160, I can't see it. There's a wall. ,Classic
1364, I have given her the drugs and she has returned to the city. ,Classic
14406, Do you sing songs or play an instrument? ,Classic
54928," Oh, I hope they're friendly. ",Classic
79589," Ah, sir, we've been trying to reach you. The building is still surrounded but we're just standing by for further orders. Over. ",Classic
127279, But later. ,Classic
108476," I don't care what the scanners say. I do care what the scanners say. Check again, Marn. There must be some malfunction. ",Classic
11006, What is that you've got there? ,Classic
53130," Hey, don't you think we better get out of here before somebody gets annoyed? ",Classic
21271, You have a good memory. ,Classic
120907, We're placing a terrible strain on the Tardis. ,Classic
105216, I could do with some dry clothes more than a hot drink. ,Classic
103215, Stinking murderer! ,Classic
43801," I quite agree, Victoria. He seems to be a public benefactor. Quite a speaker too and remarkably handsome, didn't you think so Jamie?",Classic
148184, No sense of theatre. ,Classic
136601, That's the way to do it! ,Classic
10804, Hmm? ,Classic
103361, Never mind about that. What's happening? ,Classic
130781," Yes, that's her. Tegan. ",Classic
25829," For me, my dear child? Oh, that's very thoughtful of you, thank you. Yes, at least it'll keep the rain off. Yes, it's most suitable. Ow! ",Classic
80352, Take over? ,Classic
22170, All that is needed is a subject. ,Classic
26349," Appreciate yer feelings, Doc, but I can't let ya. ",Classic
35785," What do we do with him, Doctor? ",Classic
89647," Look, I'll see you in the morning. And don't worry. I know what I'm doing.   What is it? ",Classic
131778," Even sooner, if at all possible. ",Classic
11619, Smells familiar round here. ,Classic
86388," Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating. That was a time eddy. For a moment there, time went backwards. ",Classic
115608," Well, that's a very long story. ",Classic
47013, Good grief. ,Classic
15108," Anyway, even if they are friendly, I doubt if we'll get much conversation out of them, unless one of you can lip-read. ",Classic
114180," Yes, well, didn't I give you some calculations to be getting on with? ",Classic
52091, But that's crazy! How do you open a door that isn't a door? ,Classic
120031, You blow through it. ,Classic
158657, Why not? ,Classic
157193, Yellow Kang the last believed unalive. Reason not known. ,Classic
115124," Are you all right, sir? How do you feel?   I can't talk to androids. Is he all right? ",Classic
70047," No!   Boy, am I glad that's not me in there. ",Classic
78379, Doctor? ,Classic
16602," When's it going to be operational, eh? ",Classic
119834," Goodbye.   Bye, bye, Duggan!  ",Classic
111654, When will that be? ,Classic
76112," Make out a report. Mutt found dead, as usual. ",Classic
94051," Lester, help the doctors with him. I'll take over the console. ",Classic
8456," Yes. Still, I suppose I'll get another one. I'll be able to afford it now. Planet's very rich ",Classic
153349, He lies. ,Classic
114866," Oh, no, no, of course not, my dear. ",Classic
89098, I'd better keep up the good work then. ,Classic
33051, Perkins. Trask. ,Classic
8417," Yes, all right, Susan. We're to go straight ahead to start with, and then keep turning to the right. ",Classic
22989, Operate. ,Classic
18518," Stay there and die, go outside and be killed by the machine, or surrender.",Classic
103265, Ground centre bearing seven two zero. ,Classic
87145," No, sir, he's not here, sir. ",Classic
8191," Yes, and what we propose to do, sir, is to go down into the aqueduct, find your enemies and stop them.  1 ",Classic
63914, Exactly. Only this time it'll be in force.,Classic
141108," President? How long before I must retire, my work half done. If I could continue ",Classic
111198," Here, I'm sure of it.",Classic
54224, UNITControl to CO. UNITControl to CO. Over. ,Classic
61784," Ah, but I reckon they never seen me. ",Classic
79993," Another telepathic conference, I think. ",Classic
4186," Karakorum was not a city of stone. It was just a collection of tents. When the Khan moved, the Mongols dispersed. ",Classic
47805, Robson is still officially in charge. ,Classic
136107," And go still deeper. Deeper and further. Much further. Can you hear me? Now, I want you to go into the dream. ",Classic
9707, Perhaps that's what he's waiting for. ,Classic
10971," Oh, well, they came up with some new kind of drug but it was too late then. ",Classic
94364, This is the main shaft? ,Classic
162770, What kind of feeling? ,Classic
151712, Just the one. ,Classic
6681," I nearly was. Come on, let's get going. ",Classic
79976," There you are, then. What's all this, a mass meeting? ",Classic
138159, No. I rather think he's got a lot to tell us. ,Classic
70767, Who are you? Where did you come from? ,Classic
78935," No, stop him! Stop him! ",Classic
34016," One operation, one girl. You are making an unnecessary fuss. ",Classic
109020, What's this? ,Classic
152581," I must say, I'm surprised to see you. The last time we met, your ship blew up. I thought with you on board. ",Classic
112067," Simple, isn't it? ",Classic
144006, The hostiles must be exterminated. ,Classic
75373," Your usual childish desire to gloat, perhaps? ",Classic
68470," Ah, Doctor Summers. Any news for us? ",Classic
92000, It's not quite empty. ,Classic
53528, Down there. ,Classic
28593," I'm afraid we've got all our priorities mixed up. They might be able to destroy this machine, but in all probability there are others waiting to attack us. ",Classic
135979, Well? ,Classic
76207, What? ,Classic
153492," So let's fetch them, then. ",Classic
123435, I beg your pardon? ,Classic
89005, But we have switched off the heating controls. We merely have to wait for the temperature to return to normal. ,Classic
131376, It's probably due to nothing more than a temperamental solenoid on the lateral balance cones. ,Classic
138888, What do you think you're doing? ,Classic
108709, We haven't. ,Classic
152241," Me tout for business? I'll have you know that people come from all over the galaxy for my services. Mind you, you're the first live client that I wouldn't mind tackling. ",Classic
28429, Excuse me. ,Classic
146862, Does he have enough power for such a thing? ,Classic
120030," Yeah, I know what it is, but what is it? ",Classic
118934," Ah well, yes. It's 1979 actually. More of a table wine, shall we say. Ha! The randomiser's a useful device but it lacks true discrimination. Should we sip it and see? ",Classic
64658," No, I'm going to stay and get this capsule fully operational. ",Classic
2575, We didn't even touch your ship. ,Classic
7234," Yes, and that was a dangerous thing to do, child. Because you were strong-willed and without fear, they didn't harm you. ",Classic
35748," Evans, can you hear me? Listen, Evans, this is Hobson talking. Evans, you've got to concentrate. Your brain has been altered by the Cybermen. You're being controlled by them, anyhow. We've got one or two of those things as well, you know. You can't shoot all of us so why not be a good fellow and come out of there. ",Classic
24534," Oh, but it could be true, Dassuk. Oh, don't you remember the story? Hundreds of years ago a doctor and a young couple came and then went away again. Well they were the first people to call this ship the Ark! ",Classic
83237," Well, Doctor, you didn't tell me anything. You just rushed into the Tardis, you rattled off some sort of a message and, well, then you flaked out. ",Classic
36124," Stay where you are. Guard, search him. ",Classic
73255, And carrying that gun. ,Classic
138063," Well, it never worked before. ",Classic
117974," Astra, listen. You're not under the Shadow's influence any more. Now, let's get out of here before he comes back. ",Classic
107201, What doctor? ,Classic
124416, Stop the countdown. ,Classic
22733, Vargas? I haven't seen any Varga plants. ,Classic
128207, The murder of innocent Logopolitans. ,Classic
58574," Yes, well, they got through somehow. They must have used one of the old ventilators. They seem to know their way better than our own guards. ",Classic
23880," What year is this, my boy? ",Classic
37451," Well, no. ",Classic
72603," Amoral, perhaps. They help Earth but on their own terms. It's a scientific experiment to them. Just another laboratory rat. ",Classic
114076," Anything's worth a try. Look at him, he's on his last legs. ",Classic
10294, I thought you said it flew away. ,Classic
57582," At least we can be sure they don't get away. Ian, give me a projected arrival time. ",Classic
161067," Don't you ever feel like weeping, Helen A? ",Classic
159288, But I don't have an address. ,Classic
150278, Stand at ease. ,Classic
77009," You have the engineers, haven't you? ",Classic
129351, So much for promises. You've lost me my job. ,Classic
33694," You're wasting your breath, Doctor. It was all perfectly legal. The rebels signed the contracts for transportation of their own free will. ",Classic
31371," Doctor, look. ",Classic
16317," Er, one, er, forty, er. Computer reading one five earth minutes, reducing. ",Classic
62532, Sir? ,Classic
43507, Would it? ,Classic
89908, There is no time. The power is building fast. We must be ready! ,Classic
65432," Yes. Yes, I understand. You had to do what you had to do. ",Classic
50076, I don't see why you don't accept my theory that they're simply attacking us. ,Classic
31391, Do you mean these things just need power? ,Classic
151877," Come, my friend. Be at peace with the world. Concentrate. Concentrate. There we are. Now, what seems to be the problem? ",Classic
57347, How's it going? ,Classic
105993, The crew room. ,Classic
1342, The path was rough. ,Classic
132727," Walters, I want a constant scan. ",Classic
161493, We had a leader once. He predicted your coming. Now together we shall fulfil his vision and reign over this world. ,Classic
39293, Do you want to save this man's life? ,Classic
95828," And you, by coming here, have crossed the boundary into that other universe to plunder it. Dangerous. ",Classic
83322, The most virulent form of the bacteria will be ready for release in half a Spiridon day.,Classic
34090, The name happens to be Jamie and I'll just thank you to ,Classic
109519, Affirmative. ,Classic
126142," Well, nowhere's somewhere. ",Classic
50024, In range now. Bearing one eighty one ninety as before. ,Classic
148588, Not yet. ,Classic
8494," At some time, they must have opened their minds, or experimented with the mind transmitters. Every really rational thought was crushed out, and all they had left was the game they played. The game of war. ",Classic
44567, You can't bargain with people's lives like that! ,Classic
94245," After you've been bitten, Kellman, you'll have just ten seconds to remember where that pentalium drive is, if you want to live. ",Classic
69008, Oh? What other business? ,Classic
155374, Switch on your translator. ,Classic
65968," I hardly think that's necessary. As far as I'm concerned, everything's been covered. ",Classic
149494, I've waited too long for this moment to be calm. If you knew how often the Doctor's gone out of his way to sabotage my plans. ,Classic
69750, Orbital flight path now. ,Classic
157989, Pex has been a scaredy cat. They'll be here in no time. ,Classic
54255, You realise of course that without the Professor's assistance it will not be possible to get the Cerebraton Machine on the production line. ,Classic
62640," Tell the Brigadier or Baker, they'll help. Before someone else gets killed. ",Classic
25357," What's that? Why, you young whipper snapper, I'll er ",Classic
45615," What happened, Lane? ",Classic
107816," Well, if little Cordo's at all typical, they haven't any spirit left for fighting. ",Classic
42401," We will now change the subject, please. I want to look at this man.   ",Classic
49938, I'll see of it's clear ahead. ,Classic
28854, But I've only got a couple of minutes. ,Classic
21310, Of course. ,Classic
104561," Oh, to the limit, though I suppose you've got your own men scattered throughout the audience. ",Classic
150112, He's not talking to you. ,Classic
30597," Yes. Establish contact immediately. One other thing. This is a dangerous mission. We needed for a brave man, so we asked for volunteers. ",Classic
125459, Look!   ,Classic
62535, Have you? ,Classic
106953," No, a moment, a moment. No, we must consider. ",Classic
83441, Yes. ,Classic
84419, Fell? ,Classic
119018," Oh, no, no. ",Classic
165182," He waits? He waits? What for? Has he no sense of occasion? I want him here, now. ",Classic
22290, It's all right. We've met the Monk once before. I'll explain later. ,Classic
6010, Charming person. ,Classic
46199," Yes, sir. What about Mister Chorley? ",Classic
159277, Hang on half a millisecond. ,Classic
41354, Where can we find such equipment? ,Classic
81983," Oh, need you ask? How could I leave two dear friends in such dire straights? ",Classic
8199," Splendid, sir. Splendid. ",Classic
126845," Oh, well, it wasn't difficult to guess who'd taken possession of the Tardis. I mean, there can't be many people in the universe with the capacity of just dropping in like this. ",Classic
4193, We wait the Great Khan's pleasure. ,Classic
111979," All right now, pay attention. Orders from the Graff. It seems that these natives have got a line on the thief, the one who took the jethrik and his Highness' gold. He's trapped in some place called the Concourse. Now, the natives are planning to raid this Concourse just before dawn, only we'll be there as well. And when they arrive, we'll shoot the lot of them, is that clear? No survivors, no tongue-waggers. We take the jethrik and the gold, and we head straight back for the ship. With any luck, we'll be gone before they know what's hit them. Kro. You stay on guard here. If all goes according to plan, you should hear the firing from here. When you do, kill all the prisoners immediately, understood? ",Classic
164458, Come on! ,Classic
77964," If you say so, Doctor. ",Classic
17563," The Monk, it must be. You still say there's no point in going back to the monastery? Come on.",Classic
85649," Look, Professor, your life is in considerable danger, I must insist that you ",Classic
59156," Righto! You'd better stay down there, old timer. I've got some running to do, and I don't think that you're really up to it. All right?",Classic
132055, But where? ,Classic
57195, We'll ask the computer. ,Classic
91995, Pallet three. I found it empty. ,Classic
62449," Well, this is fantastic!   What was that? ",Classic
91357," You won't shoot, Brigadier. ",Classic
157754," Oh, I hate the dark.",Classic
115836," Oh no, I make it six. One, two, three ",Classic
80926, Fire! ,Classic
128017," You can take me right back where you found me, Doctor whoever you are. My aunt's waiting in the car to take me to the airport. ",Classic
50587," There you go, Balan, that proves it. This girl's got an enquiring mind. She can't possibly come from Dulkis. ",Classic
3786," Now, she sleeps now, but if she wakes up, make sure she stays with you. ",Classic
3935," The stables, my lord. ",Classic
87317, You see? They're a danger to themselves and to all of us. ,Classic
153895," Well, that's one up to me, I think. There can't be many people who can literally claim to have saved the entire universe. Well, if that's all the muck you can rake up ",Classic
51294," Two more, and you? ",Classic
64914," Thank you, Benton.   So, they were taken away in a vehicle. ",Classic
44543," Still inside, sir. ",Classic
20495, You can't. ,Classic
73734, You're a spy. ,Classic
68265, Funny you should say that. Look. ,Classic
103822, We're going to follow it. We might get a chance to use one of these. ,Classic
126545, Stop him. ,Classic
72281," Right then, I'll ring you in ten minutes. ",Classic
64771, You have a list of simple signals and commands. Transmit and they will obey. ,Classic
110971," I didn't mean you, I meant the batteries. ",Classic
104383, Pleasant are the dreams of morning. ,Classic
85676," I'm sure the Doctor's the key to it all. He was there when one of the scientists was taken. He has a machine that can travel through time. Well, it must be him, and somehow we've got to stop him. ",Classic
78424, Right first time!,Classic
63322, Yes. How did you know? ,Classic
136591, I didn't count them. ,Classic
85322," Well, they've lost half a dozen leading scientists and several million pounds worth of ultra-secret equipment. ",Classic
53318," Yes, sir. ",Classic
127948, To renew himself. He was very near the end of his twelfth regeneration. ,Classic
43447, He doesn't know the computer's command to wait. We can threaten to destroy the glacier and his ship with it. ,Classic
131097, Tell me about the city. ,Classic
84771," Ah, Mister Yates, we were looking for you. ",Classic
150860," Doctor? We're not going fishing again, are we? ",Classic
62285," Yesterday afternoon.   What are you doing, Doctor? Doctor, what are you doing? ",Classic
21146, What about the screamers? ,Classic
1315, Susan. ,Classic
131083, Aren't you frightened? ,Classic
7111, Where's the power come from? ,Classic
138127, I'm coming! ,Classic
40504," You're not scared, are you? ",Classic
56866, I can't. I can't! ,Classic
162067," There's no mistake, Doc. Come on in. Feel free. ",Classic
143957, Prepare the duplication room. ,Classic
8414, They're entering the aqueduct now. It's a little indistinct. ,Classic
29301," But there's one hair from your head inside that doll, Tom. ",Classic
86861, Here she is. ,Classic
6890," Yes. We've had some pretty rough times and even that doesn't stop us. It's a wonderful thing, this ship of yours, Doctor. Taken us back to prehistoric times, the Daleks. ",Classic
152944, Will you stop calling me Old One? I am known as the Doctor. What else do you read? ,Classic
97671, Fancy. ,Classic
20662, Drifting round the solar system! That's the life if you can get it. ,Classic
111934," When did you leave Earth, Garron? ",Classic
138193," Whatever you're planning, you can forget it, because we're dead. We're breathing in the disease at this very moment. ",Classic
33700, So sad. Once a promising legal talent. ,Classic
42896, So we failed. ,Classic
43466," Oh, come now, Varga. That's not the way to talk. We're both of us in a very difficult situation and at times like this it beholds us both to proceed with mutual respect and, because the whole world could be ",Classic
82954, Is there no way of stopping them? ,Classic
143180, I'm the Chief Science Officer. ,Classic
133294, There was no mention of the missing crewmembers? ,Classic
75177," Yes, life is rather full at the moment, George. ",Classic
57989," Well, jealousy of your great success would be a pretty strong motive. Unless of course, you disagree. ",Classic
9358," Yes, yes, I'd better hurry back. ",Classic
89841," Ha! I came here to get power. Do you think I'm going to let go now when it's in sight, when I can see myself taking over that firm, taking over the country, the entire stinking world. I want to see them grovel, I want to see them breaking their hearts, I want to see them eating dirt. ",Classic
127810," Well, to overlay it on the Tardis. ",Classic
165080, Oh. ,Classic
35146," Right. Well, I'll leave you to it. But don't forget, twenty four hours. ",Classic
133434, The power loss is enormous. ,Classic
14065, With larvae guns? ,Classic
85861," I fear nothing, toadface! But there is little profit in butchered for naught. ",Classic
45931, Well ,Classic
37660, I don't know. Wait. The first aid post. ,Classic
74005," Right. We'll give you covering fire, just in case. ",Classic
149692, Our allies won't care for that. I promised the Group Marshal he could have the Time Lord's machine. ,Classic
128969, We have to tell him. ,Classic
93189," Turn right. Move forward and circle left. You will agree, I think, that voice control represents an enormous step forward, however the best is yet to come. Nyder.   Our machine is now equipped with a weapon for self-defence. Now, I am going to turn the machine over to total self-control. It will be entirely independent of all outside influences. A living, thinking, self-supporting creature.   Brilliant. Brilliant! It has detected the non-conformity. ",Classic
76567, He understands particle reversal. He could speed up the whole process. ,Classic
20249," Simply this. That my catapult is ready and it seems a great pity to waste it. Now you have failed me, therefore you are expendable. I propose to fire you over the walls of Troy. ",Classic
44226, What can I get for you? ,Classic
28224," Where's your friend, then. Can't see her anywhere. ",Classic
9004, Okay. ,Classic
33386," I've only just thought about it. It won't work, but it'd be a try. Anyone got any money? ",Classic
51345, Why should they? Surely no civilised race would indulge in purposeless violence? ,Classic
137671, What more do you want of me? ,Classic
106522, What we need is that corridor. ,Classic
158955," Well, I'm not absolutely certain this one's over yet.   It must be generating a spot temperature in excess of fifteen hundred Celsius. ",Classic
118714, Motors are running up. Chargers operating in full capacity. We will have launch power in thirty two minutes. ,Classic
52322," Oh, I wouldn't dream of detaining you. ",Classic
163538, It's a nuclear missile. The blast will kill you as well. ,Classic
123533, No! ,Classic
135735, It would only affect the master controls. The secondary functions will continue to operate. ,Classic
67381, Where did you go? ,Classic
8904, Here. Immediately! ,Classic
49139," Yes, I've run a new co-ordinate fix. Everything's programmed and ready. All we need now is the final signal. ",Classic
156861," Killer insects! Come on, Doctor. ",Classic
88475," Lord Ortron, what is it? ",Classic
148467," The Doctor, he's escaped. ",Classic
39040, No. ,Classic
67551," Right, sir. ",Classic
51290," Aye, they were. Och, never mind. Look, are you with me? ",Classic
47170," You can't blame us for that, surely. ",Classic
67849, Come on! Spread out! They can't have gone far! ,Classic
133058, Doctor! Doctor! ,Classic
112149, Which way? ,Classic
114046," Come along, Romana. Tally-ho! ",Classic
19020, But I ,Classic
81464, There we go. ,Classic
68903," Well, Doctor? What am I to do with her? ",Classic
146461, A pretty one. ,Classic
149224," Push, Peri! Push! Push! No, no, Peri! The other way!   Peri! ",Classic
132384, You should ask Lady Cranleigh to dance. ,Classic
83147, There's not enough lift to take all our weight. ,Classic
42158," Come quickly, sir!   I could swear there's something inside. ",Classic
14039," They stay. I go. If there is safety, I return for them. We go.",Classic
127638, I thought you meant to destroy me. ,Classic
51848," Oh, Jamie, this is hopeless. We could be going round in circles. ",Classic
82922," Come on, come on. We've got to think of something. ",Classic
73918, Are you all right? ,Classic
70920, Then what's he doing here? ,Classic
14276, Just give me my money. ,Classic
20594, It's my cousin! ,Classic
20789," I did not attend, and now you know the reason. The Daleks held a separate council at the same time. None of us of the outer galaxies went to yours. ",Classic
43878,   That's what you were meant to believe. ,Classic
123360," To live, yes. ",Classic
134493, Come on. ,Classic
32716, You have our word. ,Classic
65967, Then perhaps we can continue our discussion. ,Classic
109627, Personnel incomplete. Doctor and the mistress not on board. ,Classic
84945," He'll be all right, love. ",Classic
74154," Hepesh, enough! ",Classic
8938," Hmm? Oh, no, no, I didn't. ",Classic
143642, Who's controlling the Time Corridor? ,Classic
154901, Proceed. ,Classic
140074, Defame the King? Why should he? ,Classic
125334, I stowed away. ,Classic
159564, So do I. ,Classic
104269," Leave the rest to your servants, Lord. Go back to your abode. ",Classic
17283," Steven!   Steven, I. Leave him alone! Stop it! Stop it, Steven!   You all right? ",Classic
9032, So this isn't the first time you've risked your life? ,Classic
129883, Shush. ,Classic
15724, You'll stand a better chance outside. ,Classic
31308, Right! ,Classic
47137, What happened?? What do you want? ,Classic
76141, I think that has already been decided. ,Classic
6857, Yes. ,Classic
80305," All right. Now I'm going to lock you in here until the Captain is ready to see you, and that might not be for a long time. He's a busy man. ",Classic
5461," Good. Right, now let me see you do it. There's a weapon beside the body. Do you examine it? ",Classic
94362," Once our landing is detected, the Vogans will attack in force. ",Classic
155676," Rudge, this hijack is just a sideshow. There's a much greater menace. ",Classic
92990," Yes, I'm trying to, Sarah. Back up, Sarah. ",Classic
141603, Bridge. ,Classic
31642, But it is an intelligence that we can control. ,Classic
42237, Let's go in. ,Classic
48505," Oh, no. ",Classic
42631, Who are you? ,Classic
329, It's not true. It can't be. ,Classic
31845, Stand aside. Servants shouldn't question. ,Classic
7263, We're very dependant on the Doctor. He leads and we follow. ,Classic
22702," Oh, nonsense, nonsense. ",Classic
56831," Brent here, that man in Berlin, two in New York. But I doubt if those things were sent just to kill one or two people at random. ",Classic
126054," There is one thing, Doctor. ",Classic
62668," And have our schedule fall even further behind? With UNIT looking over our shoulder? No, I don't think so. ",Classic
78200, But the crystal. ,Classic
148753, It'll pass faster than you think. Kill them! ,Classic
73964, We've told you how it happened. ,Classic
100142," I don't have to trust him. Keep these three here as hostages. If I'm not back within the hour, you know what to do. I'll take two of your best men. ",Classic
6464, You insist upon this? ,Classic
62699," They're trying to close down the cyclotron without the nuclear reactions getting out of control.  ROBERTS  Sector two closed down, sir. ",Classic
121362, Maybe that's the entertainment? ,Classic
4456, And that's why he delayed Marco Polo's caravan. To give Noghai more time to move his armies nearer Peking. ,Classic
105884, No. ,Classic
152191, That isn't fair! ,Classic
61020," I tell you it's crazy, it'll never work! ",Classic
91519, All we have to do is get the power back on. Let's see what's over here. ,Classic
145927," You two, out. ",Classic
108426, Naturally. The execution will take place during the first work shift. Announce a two hour public holiday without pay. ,Classic
90050," The Queen? Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Greetings, O most noble Queen. May I ask what you intend to do with this young lady? ",Classic
163392," We shall make honour our standard. Put down your guns, draw your swords. Good steel will be our conscience. Do them honour. Kill them all. ",Classic
69297, Yes,Classic
19344, Do you think you can do it? ,Classic
116596, Ah. And with the firing bay already blocked ,Classic
145266," Ten, maybe a dozen. Come on, let's fumigate some squaddies. ",Classic
159573," Professor? Professor, something's activating it. ",Classic
146871, Are you all right? ,Classic
86537," Yes, that would be helpful. ",Classic
88604," I will try your plan, Doctor. Can you get a message to Gebek for me? ",Classic
58932," Come on, Dom. Come on, Doctor. Come on, Dom, in you go. ",Classic
109073, Don't move. ,Classic
60253, And you say that something appears in the middle of this barn and hundreds of men get out of it? A box? ,Classic
101533," All right, convince me. ",Classic
101242," Nevertheless, Commander, this is a Tardis. It's in an unauthorised zone. I want the occupants arrested. ",Classic
53521," This is Packer. Get some men on the roof. They're still in the lift shaft. No! Don't take the lift. Those two might still be in.   Hey, wait a minute. I'll take the lift. Tell the engineer to take it right to the top. ",Classic
59055," Look, General, will you just shut up and let me get a word in edgeways? I've got something to tell you that'll make your hair curl. Now just for once in your life, will you listen to me?",Classic
78830, Will you hear what I've got to say? ,Classic
27925, Only the leader has the right to send citizens to the interr ,Classic
126707, The main cable insulation is exposed. We might be able to short out his power. ,Classic
71467, I absolutely forbid it! ,Classic
96949," Is it. If we've landed in a prohibited area, then those people who shot at us were possibly guards. ",Classic
148028, What is the matter with you? ,Classic
63686, He caught the London train. He must be nearly there by now. ,Classic
79284," Oh, please be quiet. ",Classic
118184," Astra? Astra, where are you? ",Classic
49678, I've done some new calculations on the orbital path of the meteorite storm. They're heading toward us faster than we thought. ,Classic
15091," Only what I've read in history books. That they invaded Earth about three hundred years ago, was it? ",Classic
113222," Congratulations are unnecessary, master. ",Classic
163666," This isn't a haunted house, is it, Professor? I told you I've got this thing about haunted houses. ",Classic
117771," I have always known.   I have been waiting for you. I too serve a Guardian. A Guardian equal and opposite in power to the one who sent you. The Black Guardian, he who walks in darkness, and you are in the valley of the Shadow. ",Classic
40195, The women as well? ,Classic
107312," Come on, Mrs Tyler, wake up. ",Classic
17369," No. Tell the others to wait below. Sven, you, with Ulf and Gunnar go south. Radnor will take a similar group to the north. ",Classic
158221," Come on, let's go down to the front. ",Classic
121479, It's running. ,Classic
112834, A whining infant could tell me that. Your time is running out.,Classic
157207," I see. And who are these, er, Caretakers? ",Classic
26494, I never figured different. ,Classic
20964, Hold countdown! It's the Doctor! ,Classic
8027," He will not betray our people, nor surrender our planet.  2 ",Classic
111570, That thing. What is it? ,Classic
11425," Well, I hope I'm never like that, pretending not to care. ",Classic
156246, To find Mister JJChambers. ,Classic
18970, How long from now? ,Classic
69340," Benton, you're supposed to be suffering from severe concussion. ",Classic
63935, Trying to save your lives. Now keep out of the way and keep quiet. ,Classic
59595," Well, we've got them. You'll never believe where we found them.",Classic
54391, Receiving you. Over. ,Classic
67218," Well, I haven't noticed. ",Classic
24841, We understand. ,Classic
106144, My name is Leela. ,Classic
73500, Do not dispute with the Daleks! The function of the human is to obey! Activate the Magnetron!,Classic
85701," Ah, yes. A race of great technical achievement, but lacking the morale to withstand a determined assault. ",Classic
61238, Exactly! ,Classic
54038, Friends of the Doctors. Any idea where they are? ,Classic
127704," Sorry, Aunty. First flight nerves, I guess. Here, let me have a go. ",Classic
14068, This seems to be the Zarbi nest. How does the Animus control them? ,Classic
51227, I asked you a question. ,Classic
59363," Now, Carstairs, tell me, where did you find these civilians? ",Classic
60935," Consider their history. For a half a million years they have been systematically killing each other. Now we can turn this savagery to some purpose. We can bring peace to the galaxy, and you can help. You see, I'm not the cold-hearted villain you suppose me to be. My motives are purely peaceful.",Classic
76844, Am I left with nothing but mutants? ,Classic
80117," Well, excuse me, sir, but, well, if anything is missing, where do we say it's gone? ",Classic
11415, A lot of animals escaped from zoos during the plague. Most were killed but reptiles thrive down here. ,Classic
107507," No, it wasn't. It was a Fendahleen. It was the same think that killed the hiker and Mitchell. It can only have been created out of pure energy while the skull was restructuring Thea's brain. ",Classic
59950, One of their finest qualities. He's being brought back here for re-processing.,Classic
149322, Only two? What about the others? ,Classic
10914," Now listen, Susan. We're going to make an attack on that saucer, so we'll put off telling her until afterwards. ",Classic

55923, Put on the head sets or you will be dispersed! ,Classic
88127," Oh no, it isn't, is it, Doctor. ",Classic
50967, Yes! ,Classic
45023, But it's beyond belief. How could he possibly? ,Classic
8345," Doctor. Something moved slightly up ahead of us.   Doctor, it was a man! I know it was. ",Classic
85390, He carried this. He tried to eat it when we caught him. ,Classic
89834," Right, let's get away from here. Now, while the going's good. ",Classic
22739," There remains one question. Where is our co-ruler, the Dalek Supreme? ",Classic
17490, He must have gone back to the Tardis. ,Classic
147303, Exactly. Let's find our alien before he has time to vanish.   Almost there. Just got to lock on to his coordinates. ,Classic
83383," How, Doctor? ",Classic

145280, Sir. ,Classic

63797, I've had enough of you. ,Classic
127751," Come on, Aunty. We've got to do something. ",Classic
86454," Good grief! It's a Stegosaurus. What a splendid specimen. No, no, don't shoot. I want to take a good look at it. ",Classic
126187, You can't revive any of them out here. You need the full apparatus. ,Classic
6597," Yes, that's what I suspect. ",Classic
118368," Well, I'll tell you when you tell me what you're doing here. ",Classic
21026, I have nothing to say. I will leave now. ,Classic

139535, Why can the room be open to space? ,Classic
163084," Ace, don't touch that. ",Classic
103447, Good idea. Get some rest. ,Classic

76974," Look!   There was someone there, I tell you. There was! ",Classic
42739," Save the world? Well, that has a fine Clentian ring to it. No thanks, no. It'll take more than me to do that. But don't you worry, you don't get rid of my sort all that easily. Machines corrode and rust, but mankind goes on. You'll find Clent one of these days in a museum, like that ancient stove, with an inscription round him. Robotised human mark two, now extinct. But you'll find others like me still alive. ",Classic
46379," Oh really, Colonel, you're surely not going",Classic

113479, Then we Mentiads must try to open it. ,Classic
91572," How is she, Harry? ",Classic
164938," No, that's exactly what we won't do. He'll just go around shooting everything. No, as long as Doctor Judson doesn't work out what the inscription is, it'll keep them out of harms way. And he's a typical blinkered scientist. ",Classic

142018, There is computer resistance to the manipulator. ,Classic
393, Silence! ,Classic
19249," Yes, well the Guardians said it would take seven hundred years for this spaceship to reach the planet Refusis Two. If that navigation chart's anything to go by I'd say that they're almost there. ",Classic

159809," Good. I want a direct line to Jodrell Bank. Let's see. 1963. The Fylingdale installations and the Royal Observatory. Order them to search these localities for any signs of high orbital activity.   Now, I want the detector vans moved so they can cover this area here and here. Order all air and ground forces to avoid engaging the enemy at all costs. We must act with extreme caution. ",Classic
2490," No, it isn't. But does it have to be? I mean, things aren't always very logical, are they? It's just that one's been through so much, I've ",Classic

In this sector for some time now, Earth Government has been aware that a highly organised gang of criminals have been roaming the space ways, and preying upon defenceless cargo ships. The main target of these criminals is argonite, the most valuable mineral known to man and so far only found on the planets of the Fourth Sector. A government space beacon marking the approaches to the planet New Sarum has ceased transmitting its navigation signal. These beacons, as you know, are constructed of argonite. It is my belief that the criminals are attacking the government navigation beacons and plundering the argonite. There can be no other explanation for its failure. This being the case, I have decided to abandon our present mission and to investigate the missing beacon in the New Sarum sector. I want all section commanders on the bridge at twenty hundred hours sector four solar time. Resume normal duties until then. ",Classic

121849, To do what? ,Classic
89456," I mean, like you said, everybody's going on about meditation of one sort or another, so I thought I'd have a crack at it. Then I saw in the paper about these two Tibetans. ",Classic
76312," For goodness sake, does it matter how we got here? ",Classic
164534," I'm sorry, sir. ",Classic
96168, With a neutron accelerator. ,Classic
35172, Right. ,Classic
93592," Don't tell him, Doctor! ",Classic
77654, Mmm? ,Classic
132989," I don't know, sir. They didn't show up on the scanner. ",Classic
68751, You did well at the conference. Now I have another little task for you. ,Classic
60012, Just as well. How're we doing? ,Classic
115175, Look out! ,Classic
128079, There is a chance the computation may produce an instability. ,Classic
74929," We were just chatting. No harm done, surely. ",Classic
111667," You hangs a bit o' that around your neck, and you won't never suffer from the scringes no matter how cold it be. You'll just stay as supple and as fresh as a little old babbit in the Suntime, sir, and that be a proven fact. ",Classic
21125," What about me? If you're leaving this filthy planet so am I.  (Kirksen searches the cave for some kind of weapon, then hurries out after Bors and Garge.(",Classic
100928," No, no, let me explain. Kastria was a cold, inhospitable planet, ravaged by the solar winds. I built the spatial barriers to keep out those winds. I devised a crystalline silicone form for our physical needs. I built machines to replenish the earth and the atmosphere. I brought Kastria to life! And then, two alien planets made war on each other, and Kastria became their battleground. They destroyed my barriers. The winds came again to dehydrate the planet. The alien invaders made puppets of the Kastrian leaders. I was discredited and sentenced to obliteration. ",Classic
112051, The crown has nothing to do with it. Look at the tracer. ,Classic
117882, Yes? ,Classic
57250, There must be no failures. ,Classic
2245, Wait a minute. There's a light coming in here. Where's it coming from? Where's the light coming from? Here. Give me a hand. ,Classic
42047," Oh no, it isn't. I know Padmasambhava. He's my friend. Where have you come from? Why are you using his body in this fashion? ",Classic
18514, Temperature? ,Classic
138663," Are you, though? And the other Vanir? ",Classic
58659, I don't want them killed! There must be some other solution.,Classic
142531," Brave heart, Tegan. ",Classic
47445," Aye, that would account for quite a lot. ",Classic
48035," Let's get out of this in case, then. Where's Victoria? ",Classic
75674, The submarine? ,Classic
85343," Well, shutting us up. Like a lot of kids kept in after school. That Brigadier chap. Military idiot. ",Classic
55904, Vana? ,Classic
99998, Doctor! ,Classic
119849," Give that to me. Come on, give it to me. ",Classic
29402," Polly. Take care, love. ",Classic
63062," Yes, well, the thermostat's jammed, you see. I'm having it fixed. ",Classic
162757," The point of archaeology is to carefully recover the past, not disintegrate it. ",Classic
141507," Come along, Tegan. ",Classic
34895,   What on Earth is it? ,Classic
4866," I will explain it all in good time. Ah, here are the others. ",Classic
58954, The Liz is being operated by remote control. He must have installed an override unit in here somewhere. ,Classic
23461," But, Monsieur ",Classic
89507," The crystal from Metebelis Three. Thank you, Mister Clegg. Let's take a look, shall we?   Well, well, well.",Classic
54397," It's that Doctor, something to do with him. You should have got rid of him when you had the chance. ",Classic
98158, Do not try to understand mysteries beyond the reach of the mind.,Classic
147298, I don't understand. ,Classic
109238," Keep still. Keep still! Oh, for a weapon. ",Classic
2462," No, I was hit on the back of the neck. ",Classic
152412, Never was very keen on this Dalek thing. ,Classic
35527," So, get it? This bottle holds the stuff that puts the fire out and this cylinder pushes gas into the bottle so that stuff squirts out here. Now, all we've got to do is to undo it. Phoar. Empty it and fill it with Polly cocktail. ",Classic
146252, Yes? ,Classic
127243," I cannot. Now, Melkur, now!  (Energy bolts fire from her eyes into Seron's. He falls. ",Classic
17163," Look, you gave this ship a name just now, what was it? ",Classic
112911," Or my life, as you say. Yes, yes. We've got to go back to our own ship now and prepare some special equipment. ",Classic
143095, I'm going back for him. ,Classic
107980," D grade. Hmm. Of course! He was here, only hours ago, whining for time to pay his taxes. ",Classic
86311, Anything to say? ,Classic
76118, What are you doing anyway? ,Classic
32798, You're right. It's horrible. They've got to be stopped. ,Classic
90753," Oh, nonsense, Brigadier. You're a swinger. ",Classic
59171," Land sakes alive, girl, he's got to find the right one. He'll blow us all to bits if he moves the wrong wire. ",Classic
9867, Corsican? Ruling France? ,Classic
68296, Not unless we change the polarity. ,Classic
55426, Then you will help us? ,Classic
65842, Still too much power from the nuclear reactor. ,Classic
108568, Main pumps in. ,Classic
155950, Right. ,Classic
139128, You're not space-sick any more? ,Classic
96278, I don't believe it. ,Classic
125387, It'll do for a start. ,Classic
65736, Yes. ,Classic
156929, Everything is ready. ,Classic
123480," It's all right, he's a friend. He got me out of the Generator before Pangol started it up. ",Classic
87527, What happened to him? ,Classic
5005," I'm going back in there. If that idol works once as a trap, there's no reason why it shouldn't work again. Once inside, well, if there's no sign of Barbara, I'll follow you as quickly as I can. ",Classic
151919, I can still like flowers. ,Classic
47468," Oh, my husband isn't here. He's at the compound. ",Classic
63360," It is my job, Doctor. How many are there? ",Classic
6647, Open it! Open it! ,Classic
20303," Yes, but once they have the horse inside, won't they close the gates? ",Classic
72535," You need proof, do you? Very well, you shall have it. ",Classic
98441, How can you tell? ,Classic
102923," Yes, sir. I heard what you said. ",Classic
112156," What, now? ",Classic
5523, The fact remains that the fourth key is missing. ,Classic
82875," Where are the others, Taron and Vaber? ",Classic
107525, The gun. ,Classic
60791, It is taking longer than it should. These resistance people are putting up a good fight. ,Classic
142380, And who controls the games? ,Classic
116373, It's gone right off the screen now. ,Classic
70554, Look. ,Classic
33712, Goodbye. ,Classic
163134, So am I. ,Classic
85044, Then we can't stop them. Within a matter of hours they could be all over the countryside. ,Classic
115423, What do you want? ,Classic
33139," Now, look lively! ",Classic
83866," Aye, that's what I said. No work, no food. Logically, esthetically and morally right. Right? ",Classic
157594, Mel.,Classic
94045, They didn't have time. They were among the first victims. ,Classic
119338, Stealing the Mona Lisa to pay for chickens? ,Classic
103036, That was on the back of Chub's hand. ,Classic
158177, I love all that fifties talk. ,Classic
163124, Yes. Who else would it be? ,Classic
42230," Hey, and this tag, it says I'm a scavenger. And yours does too! Here, we're not beggars. ",Classic
147328," No, he'll find us once we start making some noise. We've arrived. ",Classic
125418," Whatever you say. Well, if I'm staying.   You wouldn't have any cheese, would you? ",Classic
21621," I have. I realise of course that I am no match for the Daleks, so if I hand it over, will you help me and my friends to get away from this planet? ",Classic
37251, Photograph? ,Classic
110511," Well, I've heard it rumoured, but it's a subject that's never mentioned. ",Classic
12845," Oh, I see. You mean revenge against me? Oh no, no. I mean, it's nothing to do with me personally, is it? ",Classic
40690," Oh, you're stupid. You still think that your puny minds can survive against us? You're decadent, weak. Do you know that? Weak! ",Classic
120627, Are you all right? ,Classic
109365, And you do the work? ,Classic
68597, Fire. ,Classic
65388, How on Earth did you find us? ,Classic
104176, Anything else? ,Classic
46918, Wait! Can't you see he's fallen over? ,Classic
157658, Of course. That's where I'm meeting the Doctor. ,Classic
96785, Venerate his name and obey him in all things. ,Classic
144867, The last Trion ship to come here crashed and Malkon was the only survivor. It must have been the ship my father was on. ,Classic
119350, They've been here a long time. Get on with it. ,Classic
146608, Just give me directions and I'll go alone if you're afraid. ,Classic
112758, Master. ,Classic
12891," You understand what you must do, Locusta? ",Classic
81033," Will one of you kindly explain to me exactly where I am? Which planet, I mean? ",Classic
146991, You think that I would be so vulnerable? You're an interfering fool. ,Classic
161451, What? ,Classic
34780, Goodbye. ,Classic
157191," But, Chief. ",Classic
120527, You must have been born under a particularly favourable conjunction of celestial circumstances. ,Classic
137655, You mean he's here with you as well? ,Classic
56081," Now, Zoe. ",Classic
66745," Well not now, there isn't. He's probably been killed by those things! ",Classic
51007, Who cares what they want. What are we going to do? ,Classic
47551, It's still wet. ,Classic
35257, Polly! What's happened? Polly. Are you all right? ,Classic
83541, That's Wester!,Classic
69119, You've got to be joking. ,Classic
128242, I don't ,Classic
161213," Nemesis has come to Earth on that piece of ground. In the new era, all this will be a shrine. ",Classic
79622," It's just a pencil, isn't it? ",Classic
124409," Seven, six ",Classic
151548, No. He's an old friend. ,Classic
52466, Authenticated. You may enter.,Classic
3214," Barbara, you can't go out there! ",Classic
123253, Surely that's not the woman we saw on Earth? ,Classic
102861," Right, sir. ",Classic
118945," I assure you, Professor, money is no problem. ",Classic
105685," Some men make me nervous when I'm with them. Salisbury, Bonar Law. With your employer, it's the opposite effect. I get nervous when he's out of my sight. ",Classic
93233," But you did save me from becoming the very first victim of a Dalek, thank you. ",Classic
34722," And you best forget about all that now and look to the future. That is, if we're going to have any future.   Well, personally speaking, not being a terribly good swimmer myself, I think I'll just start to make a move. ",Classic
163130," Yes, well, Ace got out all right. ",Classic
40769," Yes, it's a Tibetan bell, actually. A holy relic. This one is quite small. It has a dragon on it. As a matter of fact, it has rather an interesting history. It was. Oh. Ah ha, yes, I'll have that.  The Doctor takes out a huge fur coat.)   Yes, it's just the thing for this climate. Now, you might as well find yourselves something while you're about it. How do I look? ",Classic
84045," Cut off!   Well, now it's engaged. ",Classic
33335," I tell you what we're going to do. We ladies are going to leave first, but you are going to sit here, quietly, comfortably, for another ten minutes. ",Classic
7193, Nobody's arguing about that. ,Classic
129104," We found it, and no thanks to these Castrovalvan people. They kept leading us round and round and back to the square. ",Classic
128905," In pursuit of which belief, he drives us to hunt animals in the wilds beyond the walls. ",Classic
59607, He really seems to believe they had a fair trial! ,Classic
18545," Why do you not give up, Earthman? ",Classic
99331," What, because you're involved, it's your life ",Classic
79763, No. There's only one thing for it. ,Classic
73096, No! A strong leader can force him to learn. ,Classic
164329," Oh, Mama, what have we done? ",Classic
32005, Yes? ,Classic
6714," No, I shall. I have another task for you. ",Classic
160554, It's of no consequence. ,Classic
105713,"   Remember, say nothing. ",Classic
140826," It sounded like something very large and very fierce, and probably very hungry. Come on.",Classic
92636, First saw him creeping about that circle. ,Classic
81653," Just a moment please, your Highness. Bring them in. ",Classic
150338, We brought most of this equipment with us. How could it have been installed before we got here? ,Classic
151774, Doctor! ,Classic
58476, Which end did he land on when you fell down that shaft?,Classic
66686, And where's the rest of it? ,Classic
110132, What do you think? ,Classic
4438," Yes, my lord, but you would be well advised to have the Doctor with you when you open it. ",Classic
46595," Don't be a fool, boy! We can't fight those things bare-handed. We must work out a plan! ",Classic
15720," Am I correct, sir? ",Classic
130194, Your what? ,Classic
29194," You're going to tell us, ain't ya. Ay? Ay? ",Classic
140418, Find what? ,Classic
147557, You know of him? ,Classic
52740, What do you want to bring him for? ,Classic
18134," But, you were away so long. ",Classic
137134, Someone might come back. ,Classic
71479,   This is the Adjudicator. I have received an emergency call and am preparing to leave this planet immediately. I wish to see Captain Dent at once. ,Classic
132419, I'm afraid I'm lost. ,Classic
115023, What if the android breaks down? ,Classic
91389," Still nothing, sir. We're spreading the search radius wider and wider, but the bigger the area to cover the harder it gets. ",Classic
129150, It's been agreed to carry him to the Portreeve. We must all help. ,Classic
109149," Two hundred and fifty kilometres below planet surface. Speed mach point three, decreasing. ",Classic
130326, What? ,Classic
55679, I'll look for him. You stay under here.,Classic
164605, Want to do it again? ,Classic
85716," You give them breech-loading guns now, they'll have atomic weapons by the seventeenth century. They'll have the capability to destroy their own planet before they're civilised enough to handle it. ",Classic
141901, We will need the Commander's hand scan for clearance. ,Classic
105804," Me? Oh, don't be so ridiculous. ",Classic
148111, Like this Governor we do not. Replace you must arrange most soon. That is what our secret payments to you are for. ,Classic
82393, You will obey me. ,Classic
117881, Hey! ,Classic
24047," Improbable as it may seem, dear boy, I think the child, Dorothea ",Classic
61973, Your mystery man with the police box? ,Classic
142286," Not yet, my dear. ",Classic
148414," Oh, no. What's he want? ",Classic
164483, Crane! ,Classic
136181," Dojjen. Oh yes, of course, that was it. ",Classic
25495, Not a bad dancer for a civilian. ,Classic
66986, And if he tries to go by himself? ,Classic
128661, Console room. Look after the Doctor.   That's odd.,Classic
152649, I created you! I am your master! ,Classic
90125, How is our mother? ,Classic
127643," It's useless, father. You can't stop it. ",Classic
79781," Yes, and I'm somewhat confused. Who's he? ",Classic
89327," Well, I shall always be grateful for the honour, your Majesty. But I'm quite certain that Gebek is the right man. ",Classic
8282, Then why does your friend write what is not true? ,Classic
1224, Yes. ,Classic
4711, So is his kitchen. Delicious. ,Classic
124207, Mistress. ,Classic
7606," Very well, I agree. ",Classic
133067," Well, the androids now know we have the ability to inflict serious on them, so if we attack that hatch, we create a dilemma. ",Classic
108187," Oh, I am gratified. ",Classic
78025, Yes. ,Classic
40849, I also found a dead man. ,Classic
76445," Would you kindly explain that remark, sir? ",Classic
80592," Hey, it was them. They did it on purpose. ",Classic
142270," Malus come. Malus's got to war, ain't he? He makes fighting worse. He makes them hate more. ",Classic
102592, Who are you? ,Classic
29961," Doctor, it's just like the Squire said. Avery's curse.",Classic
100986, Look before you leap. ,Classic
100537," With you in a minute, sir. ",Classic
50810, Good. ,Classic
51315, Jamie! Then he and Cully are alive! ,Classic
1914," It is dangerous, yes, but I realised last night when I was talking to Barbara that it is undefended. ",Classic
108651, Me. Nobody works today. ,Classic
95931," Sarah, Vandervelt's equation of knowledge. Quite wrong. ",Classic
73952," Yes, we fixed on the tunnel as a place that was stable in your time and in ours. We used it as a transfer point. Well, you know the rest. ",Classic
146832," Give me your right hand.   Now yours.   Well, do you remember? ",Classic
37075," Well sir, they came with the passengers from flight 729 from Madrid, but they've no passports. ",Classic
13957," Yes, I wonder why I didn't realise that before. The same force drew and holds the Tardis here. Yes, of course, it's remarkable, most interesting. ",Classic
138022, What will this do? ,Classic
115353," I'm, I'm too weak. I'd only get in the way. ",Classic
108051, Yes. I was an executive grade at the chemical plant in charge of PCM production. I got curious about some of the other products. ,Classic
2138," Yes, yes, yes. I can always make another one if necessary. ",Classic
78124, What are you doing? ,Classic
87674,   The point is it wasn't us. We have no loyalties to them. They're not part of our mission. ,Classic
77459," Come on. Will you excuse us? We'll see you all, later. ",Classic
6315," But that's Ixta, Doctor, and he's fighting Ian. ",Classic
24964," As you have seen, I have many copies. ",Classic
151163," Hey, wait a minute. ",Classic
137630, Where is Mawdryn? ,Classic
77530, Of course. Of course. ,Classic
36255, We can't leave Ben. ,Classic
72287," Oh, this is stupid! ",Classic
47119," Gas from the sea? Oh, who are you trying to kid? ",Classic
59776," Well, only this safe. ",Classic
91469," I'll have it taken away. Broken up, just in case. ",Classic
27714," Doctor, are you all right? How did you get here? ",Classic
89383," Oh, then, er, what exactly is it you want of me, gentlemen? ",Classic
101563," I see. Well, if there is anything further to be discovered, Castellan. ",Classic
44735," Shush, I think I heard something. ",Classic
152569, Look out! ,Classic
88654,   What is he doing? ,Classic
122714," No, well, you see what happens is  Romana. ",Classic
138068, The Doctor! ,Classic
148547, I see. Thank you. ,Classic
88447, Blor has been slain by the wrath of Aggedor like the others. All of this trouble began as soon as the Doctor arrived on Peladon. ,Classic
48226," It's all right, John. ",Classic
7236, There's nothing wrong with that. ,Classic
60437," I, well, these people have shown considerable courage and enterprise. They may make future leaders. ",Classic
16330," No. Well, if we can't escape from them, we'll have to stay and fight 'them. ",Classic
93518, Then soon. And somewhere we can talk in private. ,Classic
95655, You are in orbit around planet Zeta Minor. You're a Morestran prisoner. ,Classic
12968, Each other. ,Classic
122231, Have you seen it? ,Classic
12426, Chesterton. ,Classic
64860," Yes. Taltalian was a weak link, you know. I think his employers wanted him out of the way. ",Classic
24395," Yes, now I want you to find all the sick people in this spaceship and give them the same treatment. ",Classic
76146," Oh, no you don't! ",Classic
88446, Come on.,Classic
159248," Good afternoon, shoppers. This is the new management speaking, Captain Glitz. It's time for a few changes. ",Classic
148295," When I control this planet, I will possess the means of power throughout this entire galaxy! And, perhaps, for all others beyond. ",Classic
139147, And where do you function? ,Classic
123921, Then you will allow him to inspect the Dodecahedron? ,Classic
19155," Yes, cover him. We must keep him warm at once. ",Classic
27326," Might be too late. Besides, we can't go. They might have got the Doctor. ",Classic
39600," Oh, and what is the point then? ",Classic
164277, I know you. I took you up as the last specimen of the extinct Neanderthal race from Earth. ,Classic
149490," Oh, will you tell the Doctor where I've gone? ",Classic
94834," Brigadier, why have you called me back? I hope you've got a very good reason. ",Classic
25838, I don't know who you are or what right you have ,Classic
91270, Good man. ,Classic
152647, I'll look in Bostock's pocket. ,Classic
105124, It's not even Hove. It could be Worthing. ,Classic
14348, Over whose head hung sentence of death.,Classic
137712, Let's get back to the Tardis before they become hostile. ,Classic
24353, Is it your vote that we exact the full penalty of the special Galactic law? ,Classic
36330, No. There were no such creatures. ,Classic
56446, I never thought I'd see that again. A rocket rising in flight. ,Classic
144036, Not bad. ,Classic
155201," Doctor, you're required on the bridge. ",Classic
145752," Well, I reckon we deserve that. ",Classic
13955," Yes, the magnetic pole, I see, I see. You mean it draws and uses the power from the planet Vortis. ",Classic
118220," Why not? We're not going back to Atrios, are we? ",Classic
87959, I don't understand. ,Classic
131782," Sir, you have a very mean way of exposing a man's cowardice.  (The lookout in the tree indicates that there are now two parties to track. ",Classic
143136," Steady, young man. Not much further to go. ",Classic
103858, Where's my Emma? What have you done with her? ,Classic
4229," I am not a doctor of medicine, sire, otherwise I should be able to cure these pains. ",Classic
10341, Listen. There's someone in the room! Someone's come back into that room. ,Classic
81027, One alien hardly constitutes an emergency. ,Classic
129337, Can't be far. ,Classic
89077," Oh, I know that. Bit chummy though, aren't they? As if they were. Can you get me sound on this? ",Classic
147189," It may come as a great disappointment to you, but I don't intend to enter the bank guns blazing and my face covered in a nylon stocking. ",Classic
70657, Hello. ,Classic
75152, As soon as possible.,Classic
133172, There was power in that circuit! ,Classic
165406," Sergeant Paterson. You show me a better way of surviving, and I'll give it a go. ",Classic
65332, There was a gas cylinder linked to the ventilation system. ,Classic
158157," Now, inside this box is the only Quarb crystal this side of Softel nebula. ",Classic
3071," Well, ask the Khan again.",Classic
94433," Fragmatise? Oh well, I suppose we can't expect decent English from a machine. ",Classic
95641, But how are you? Galactic Mission Control received no word from you. They sent us to investigate. ,Classic
7257," It's a spectrograph, Susan. You see these lines? They represent the emission wavelengths. ",Classic
11343, I took them off work detail to help me pick up these tools. ,Classic
123099, Morik sent you all the way to Earth just for this? ,Classic
90009, No! No! ,Classic
93697," I know precisely what I am saying. Now, I will command and you will obey. You will do as I order! You will inform the rebel leaders that I have given these orders to avoid bloodshed. Tell them I submit, and will listen to their demands. That is all. ",Classic
152169," Please me, and I can offer you the universe.   Stay with me. See what goes on here. I will tell Jobel where you are. ",Classic
7575, The evil minds. ,Classic
56974," Look, a lot of good we are. ",Classic
122361, I have a complaint to make. ,Classic
94007, The mention of Cybermen fills me with dread. ,Classic
124642," Oh, a homing device. ",Classic
141685, That won't do much good. ,Classic
42758," Because I must know. Now, put this knife to more sensible use.",Classic
132969, That's not possible. There's no reading. ,Classic
56864, What was in those things? ,Classic
452," We should use our cunning. I hope you can get yourself free, Chesterton. I can't. The stench in here. The stench. I'm sorry. It's all my fault. I'm desperately sorry. ",Classic
111021, I do. Five four two lever. ,Classic
94077," Well, they reckoned it was better to lose one space crew than take the chance of carrying an extraterrestrial disease back to Earth. ",Classic
148084, The people are anxious for a decision on the new price of our product. ,Classic
157477, What? ,Classic
98839, They've got a second pod. ,Classic
160013, The Hand of Omega's inside this box. The most powerful and sophisticated remote stellar control manipulator device ever constructed. ,Classic
139343," On deck, you will have an interesting view of our competitors. It may help you to decide which one is the saboteur. ",Classic
58661, Dyce. ,Classic
572, A dead animal. ,Classic
29177, Ah. ,Classic
157941, Most of the Rezzies make table cloths. We could throw them over the Cleaners to slow them down for you to shoot. ,Classic
91207," Yes, and start a nuclear holocaust that would turn this little planet of yours into a radioactive cinder suspended in space. ",Classic
131076," Well, I'm sure he's around somewhere.   If you want to look. ",Classic
30029, Put the kettle on. ,Classic
22200," We fitted the core you gave us. It has failed to activate the Time Destructor, therefore it is not taranium. ",Classic
146325, Hmm. What about our own ship? ,Classic
160448, Rather a shocking experience. ,Classic
67837, You mean there isn't a horse inside. ,Classic
110392, I am Nesbin. ,Classic
13609, Where is the third? ,Classic
13787, Will you kill your own kind? ,Classic
67337," Sir Keith, I think you'd better give orders for that shaft to be filled in straight away. ",Classic
61195, We don't listen to your lies no more. ,Classic
156280, It's yours. ,Classic
16079, Hello! ,Classic
72860," Shut up. That's right, friends. Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. Burn him! ",Classic
150857, That's the whole point. It's not in two places at the same time. My Tardis is at least five minutes walk from here. After you. ,Classic
26851, Nope. ,Classic
16541," Why did he go away so quickly?   Well, I can't seem to open it from this side. Vicki, do you supp .   Vicki? Vicki, where are you? ",Classic
149823, It's unimportant. ,Classic
12706," Pettulian? Very well, ask him to come in. ",Classic
65011," There's a call for you, Brigadier. ",Classic
54152," Quick, man! ",Classic
40417, Altered? ,Classic
25998, What do I owe you? ,Classic
20618," She's all right. I know she is. She's gone to find Troilus and she'll be quite all right. This is just what she wanted. Now calm down. Yes, quiet, quiet. ",Classic
58300, Leave it. ,Classic
163388, Your Majesty. ,Classic
75303, Only a complete fool would listen to such an accusation. Though I suppose in your case. ,Classic
107043, You meant all that stuff about restrictions? ,Classic
120126, Someone could climb down to him. ,Classic
1178, Susan? ,Classic
138483," Remember when we were underneath the floor? Well, I noticed something familiar. It's only just come to me what it was. Come on. ",Classic
90230, Rest? How can you be so calm? ,Classic
77215, Transfer system isolating now.,Classic
149430," Well, that makes two of us. ",Classic
10615," Well, well, here we are then. The patient is beginning to look her usual self again. ",Classic
45462, Like that stuff we saw on the scanner. ,Classic
23535, Admiral. ,Classic
149482," That's what I need, valerian. Do you know it? ",Classic
155905, Melanie? Glitz? What are you doing here? ,Classic
29779, But I have told him of the shore and the tomb wherein our store is hid. ,Classic
97829," I can see that, you chicken-brained biological disaster, but how? And where? That drug. Did you put it all into the wine? ",Classic
76777," Well, I left her here. Perhaps she became frightened, ran off in panic. ",Classic
93182,   ADalek. ,Classic
102660, He acted as though he was possessed. ,Classic
87785," It may already be too late, but we will do what can be done. ",Classic
118671, Doctor. Doctor. ,Classic
67910," You wait there and I'll show you.   Bye bye, Jo. ",Classic
90532," Sarah, listen to me. Struggle against the spider, Sarah. Fight it! ",Classic
131282, Can we go? ,Classic
90268, I shall visit the cave of the crystal and ask the approval of the Great One. Do you hear me? I shall this very day speak with the Great One herself. ,Classic
135325, There's no need for all the fire power. ,Classic
116136, We've got nothing else. Can you think of a better way of killing it? ,Classic
84084," Yesterday, so presumably they can't have any ",Classic
45656," Wait a minute, Jamie! I'm Victoria Waterfield. And that's Jamie McCrimmon! ",Classic
40016," You're seeing things, old chap! Come and look at this. The whole control panel is active suddenly. I don't know which button to press first. ",Classic
86181, There's no bus. ,Classic
104748, Well? Where is it? ,Classic
11194, It's beginning to wear off. ,Classic
111936, Really? What happened? ,Classic
124370," I inverted your control setting. If he starts the countdown, he'll destroy himself, as well as you and me and, well, the whole planet, of course. ",Classic
157676," But Chief, if this goes on and the Cleaners are out of control, how many of us are going to be left? ",Classic
32483, The Daleks. They're teeming all over the corridors. We've got to get back to Lesterson's lab. ,Classic
81397," But all these charges are false, your Highness. We are not attacking Draconian ships. We never have. ",Classic
78396," Yes, well of course it is. So what do you think would happen? ",Classic
151891, I can but try. Look at the state I'm in. I don't know whether my hand shakes from fear or the delirium tremens. ,Classic
128919, The Portreeve? A sort of magistrate? ,Classic
156365," You know, I think I was rash in turning down that offer of the Presidency. ",Classic
114513," I beg your pardon, your Honours. I was consulting with my associate. ",Classic
143167," Ah, Mister Range. We've been waiting for you. I've a file here. It's contents amount to a charge of sedition. Bring them along to the State Room. ",Classic
56409, Fully charged. ,Classic
61477, You have no authority over me.   And no power any longer to pass any sentence. Take these people. ,Classic
144596, Circuits? You really are some kind of robot? ,Classic
50614," Oh, you mean they're going to find out how clever we are? ",Classic
27435," No, Senta. Look, it's working! ",Classic
43942," Oh, I see. What about me? ",Classic
16574," Oh, there you are! ",Classic
82022," Oh, he's not a bad fellow when you get to know him.",Classic
116658," It's all right, it's all right. ",Classic
149742," Dastari, I have no doubt you could augment an earwig to the point where it understood nuclear physics, but it'd still be a very stupid thing to do!",Classic
90725, Apparently. Saw it happen this time. Lieutenant Sullivan? ,Classic
53489," There was a fifty-fifty chance, you know, Jamie. ",Classic
38313, Ay? ,Classic
56587, Yes. ,Classic
134124, We've lost them. ,Classic
104185," Yes, sir. ",Classic
27807," I never trust the strangers, and Chal is not here. ",Classic
7013," Grandfather, look! We're heading straight for it. ",Classic
65407," Given the necessary equipment, yes. ",Classic
131211," Well, well. ",Classic
24366," But can we not afford to take a chance? After all, the old man was the first to diagnose the illness. For that reason alone, he may be able to find a cure. ",Classic
56903," I shall return shortly. You will remain here.   The humans that escaped, have they been found? ",Classic
71304, Quite so. ,Classic
59834," Well, at least it stopped them taking him to a prison camp. Besides, he's safe in the ambulance with Jennifer. ",Classic
1151," No, no. Thals? What are you talking about? We're not Thals, or whatever you may call them. Can't you see we're very ill. ",Classic
145195," It's a figure of speech. You see, the core of this planet is superheated primeval mud. When its orbit takes it close to Androzani Major, the gravitational pull ",Classic
29478," Why, is there trouble? ",Classic
125106," Decider Nefred, what are we to do? Tell us. Tell us what to do. ",Classic
16232, Remain on guard. ,Classic
46419," On the floor, by that young lad Weams, it was. ",Classic
40974, What do you mean? Show me. ,Classic
70726, And what happened? ,Classic
69345," Well, I wondered if you'd had any news about Captain Yates, sir. ",Classic
18444, Killed? By whom? ,Classic
53015," Hold it now. Last one. Okay, you can relax. ",Classic
38350, Kennedy to base. Kennedy to base. Do you read me?,Classic
22155," Having had your contribution to this great weapon stolen, it must be a relief to you now that the Daleks have managed to recover it. ",Classic
123534, I'm glad this has ended so satisfactorily. ,Classic
39220, I see. What of the experiment? ,Classic
124547," I mean, you can't even steal a few river fruits. ",Classic
62904, Indeed. And what do you propose to do about it? ,Classic
33893, Be quick and say it then. ,Classic
59409," Escort and accused, left wheel! By the front, quick march. Left, right, left, right, left wheel. Mark time. Halt! Right turn! ",Classic
45395," What do you want me for, anyway? ",Classic
157751," Well is suppose it is one way of seeing the Paradise Towers, just so long as nothing goes wrong with the lift. ",Classic
56754, I can't! They'll kill us both! ,Classic
29755," They've gone, haven't they, Tom. Be a good lad and tell me where, ay?",Classic
1750, You mean this   became ,Classic
128075," My dear Doctor, of course. ",Classic
154712,   I shall return. ,Classic
95671, That's what I said. We picked up a distress call and landed immediately. ,Classic
66205," Staffed by slave labour, I take it? Well, you're all in very grave danger. ",Classic
40783," No, to the right. ",Classic
34877, Some sort of great glow in the sky. ,Classic
123951," Oh yes, of course, yes, I remember you very well. ",Classic
138418, Chain reaction. ,Classic
13260, This what? ,Classic
65395, What are you doing? ,Classic
86504," Doctor, what about that man we saw in the garage? ",Classic
155370," That would be a serious offence, Doctor. ",Classic
103798, What is your intention? ,Classic
81977," He's in another prison, on the moon. We're going to collect him. ",Classic
67645, Try sitting in it.  Mc ,Classic
72240," Og ot erus saw bmal eht tnew yram taht, erehwyreve dna, wons sa etihw saw eceelf sti, bmal elttila dah yram!. ",Classic
154029, He is dead. ,Classic
164977, Doctor. ,Classic
143708," Tell them, Colonel. They've guessed most of it already. ",Classic
71430," Well, it was a being of tremendous intelligence, probably one of the rulers of this city. Three different races or three mutations of the same race? ",Classic
8149, Yes. I suppose it must. ,Classic
7533," Well, we're all ready now. ",Classic
145456, Salateen? We've not met him yet. Where's he chained up? ,Classic
70715," Leeson's dome. I repeat, Leeson's dome. Do you read me? ",Classic
87543, Where is the ship? ,Classic
15674, Soldier! Leave that. Where is the relief guard for this entrance? ,Classic
25940," Oh, okay. But I'll be thinkin' of ya. ",Classic
109170," Right, Orfe. Open up. ",Classic
58391," We're forty three thousand miles out, on course for the beacon sections. ",Classic
105887, Come along. ,Classic
34043, Look. Atlantis underwater. ,Classic
93617," I know I am. Many of us believe that production of the Daleks must end. I believe now that we are in the majority. If we act soon, we can break his power. ",Classic
108916," Time for the next sweep, Tala. Set up for the next sweep. ",Classic
135390, You are telling me the truth? ,Classic
160507, Smiling? ,Classic
12734, Maximus Pettulian. ,Classic
111298, Master? ,Classic
18166," In the first place, madam, I never kill anything. Neither do my friends. ",Classic
64099, Buffeting slightly. Firing port retro jets to compensate. Moving in for link up now.   I have link up. ,Classic
9210," And what do you think he'll say when he hears you delayed me, hmm? ",Classic
28284," Yes, I suppose isn't too late to get a cab, is it? ",Classic
146187," Yes, naturally you're anxious. Please leave this to us. I'll get the Commander to call you back. Goodbye.   Sorry to disturb you, Commander. ",Classic
52793, Are you trying to get out? ,Classic
73085," I seem to remember somebody else speaking like that. What was the bounder's name? Hitler. Yes, that's right, Adolf Hitler. Or was it Genghis Khan? ",Classic
121272," Yes, but who's helping whom? ",Classic
3177," Yes. There he is, over there. ",Classic
152532, Cannot see. My vision is impaired. I cannot see. ,Classic
29295," We have, Tom, from our master. Now, you see the gibbet? You see the fellow what's swinging here? ",Classic
120938, Great. ,Classic
58762," What, now? But look, Caven, I've only just got back. ",Classic
9145, Just drink it all up. ,Classic
107117," What? Well, about twelve million. That's when the fifth planet broke up. There are four thousand million people here on your planet, and if I'm right, within a year there'll be just one left alive. Just one. ",Classic
36598, All ready. ,Classic
153058," When we first saw you, Peri, you were not alone. ",Classic
65451, How long's it going to take? ,Classic
164300," Professor, Control's got a few things to show Josiah. ",Classic
122746," Here, sit down. ",Classic
130295, Could I see them? ,Classic
11968, Hmm? ,Classic
155892," Doctor, if you were not already facing the most serious charges, such an accusation levelled at a senior prosecutor would bring you into contempt.  ",Classic
87130," Well, they're out on this big hunt, Miss, looking for the Doctor. ",Classic
14998, Doctor! You can't dismiss it like that! We were standing here in thirteenth century clothes. We can't suddenly ,Classic
155679," Rudge, you're nothing but a squalid criminal. ",Classic
72955, The energy exchanger. This machine that the Brigadier is building for me. With that I should be able to drain off our visitor's energy. Then perhaps we can sort him out.,Classic
118675, I found the other prisoners. They told me what you'd done to free them. They're very grateful. ,Classic
68142, Afterwards? ,Classic
28654," Look out, sir! ",Classic
142757," Hmm, someone else thinks this is their territory. ",Classic
86169, Somewhere in London. ,Classic
51017," And submission leads to slavery. We must fight. How about you, Cully? ",Classic
112516, Shall we have a look at Calufrax now? ,Classic
133823," Lieutenant Scott, Captain. ",Classic
12756," Well, here were are Ian, Rome. Now what? ",Classic
122630," Come on, let's get out of here. ",Classic
15815, Lobos! ,Classic
156587," Oh, don't start all that again. Look, repair the machine and maybe we'll find the solution. ",Classic
164250," Ah, Lady Pritchard. I've been wanting a word with you. Perhaps we can sort this business out over a pot of tea. ",Classic
70239," The Master!   Right, not a sound. Benton, get some more men. Yates, with me. Sir George, you stay here. ",Classic
39428, We are destroying this area. ,Classic
89249, On! On to the throne room! ,Classic
164418," Take off? They've gone, like a passing thought. As long as their minds don't wander. ",Classic
30321, Certainly. ,Classic
17709, Doctor. Doctor. ,Classic
23242," Oh, I shall be all right. Besides, my friend should be returning soon. ",Classic
25748," All right, but something's got to be done. We can't just stand here and talk our way out of this. ",Classic
45237, The people underground in the deep shelter. ,Classic
143985, Tegan has severe concussion. It's vital she receives proper medical attention. ,Classic
15917, Did you ever see anything like it in your life? ,Classic
62977, Doctor Quinn. How did you get here? ,Classic
126972, I've got the nasty feeling it's looking at us. ,Classic
65369, They have some kind of translation machine. ,Classic
9583," He did as you said 'e would, Citizen. He tried to get the young girl released, and he let the other prisoner go. ",Classic
98872," Sit down! Come on, move. ",Classic
135983, Omega? ,Classic
165202, You are summoned. ,Classic
50473," Really, Cully, you and your friends might at least have agreed upon the same story. ",Classic
124261, You are forbidden in the Power room! ,Classic
69171," Yes, maybe. Right, thanks. ",Classic
147524, What is it? ,Classic
56507, So did we. ,Classic
108132," All my systems are at maximum function, mistress. ",Classic
124694, Where is the Doctor? ,Classic
129488, We've met. ,Classic
29778," Once we have the treasure, we are made men. But they are to be crushed, or we are dead men. ",Classic
149501," A marginal error, quickly corrected. ",Classic
90630," Yes. Yes, of course. ",Classic
72982, I ,Classic
11096, Find every survivor. Destroy every one. Destroy them! Destroy every one of them! Destroy! ,Classic
4734, But I am serious. Goodnight. ,Classic
99814, Stay there a minute.   Some soldiers up there. No. We'll just have to wait till they've gone. ,Classic
118367, Why? What do you know of Skaro? ,Classic
80746," Oh, Doctor, I've got to rest. ",Classic
161677, Twenty one. Twas a slow poison. ,Classic
154664, One microcentile more. ,Classic
39031, It took courage to fight Maxtible's Turkish wrestler. ,Classic
127247, No! ,Classic
141793, Excellent. We expect the Myrka to take the bridge very soon. ,Classic
161959," Ace.   What do you reckon happened here, Professor? Were the people in this bus attacked on their way to the circus? ",Classic
131490, He nearly killed us. ,Classic
42945, You're not hurt? ,Classic
21588," If I do, what guarantee is there that you won't fire your guns afterwards? ",Classic
31450," I don't know. It's none of your business. You go and get Janley and then come back here. We haven't got any time to waste. Now go on, man. Quickly, quickly.   They won't stop me experimenting. There must be some way to bring you back to life, and I'm going to find it.",Classic
108329," Yes. There are only two work units on duty up there. You're right, Doctor. It could be done. ",Classic
33457,"   You sail, fog or no fog. ",Classic
51059," Hey, what are you doing in there? ",Classic
74263," You are right, chairman delegate. Moreover, the throne room is hardly the place for such discussions. ",Classic
154301, Try it. Should respond to the lexifier now. ,Classic
34498, I don't see what you've got to laugh at. ,Classic
101196," No, no, forget the mergin nut. I'll have the ganymede driver. ",Classic
21642," Form up, attack formation. ",Classic
120595, The Creature. ,Classic
82053," Yes, it had better not. All right, you can go. ",Classic
135683, Fusion? ,Classic
52400," If you give me away this time, I'm finished. ",Classic
26633," Kinda young for responsibility, ain't you, boy? ",Classic
72880," Give him a sign of your power, O mighty one! ",Classic
6737, Right. I'll whistle if anyone comes. ,Classic
163576," Then put a stop to it, Morgaine. End the madness. ",Classic
39243, In there? ,Classic
33557, You had better be very sure. ,Classic
150524," Run, Jamie! ",Classic
22983," The wind. Listen, can't you hear it? I've never heard that on Kembel before. ",Classic
4109," Come to think of it, we do strike inland. I'll talk to the commander of the caravan. ",Classic
163119, Oi! ,Classic
134883," And taken everything with him, including the bits of my Tardis.",Classic
118594, The universe. ,Classic
120321," What about the rest of it? The arms, the legs, the body? ",Classic
116369," Well, there's no other way of getting across. ",Classic
64037, I'm reading okay. One degree. Now. Manoeuvre completed. ,Classic
107120, I am. ,Classic
7805, We must match cunning with cunning. ,Classic
16779, I don't have to. ,Classic
115112," Well, of course. Anyway, we need Zadek to get us into the palace, right? ",Classic
6544," At that time, a sacrifice will be made to the Sun God, and this young man ",Classic
108005,   ?? Hade. Time is money. ,Classic
87660," What about you, Doctor? ",Classic
18164," We only have your word for that. In any case, I can't help you.",Classic
17693," This way, Doctor. Oh, er, mind your head. ",Classic
163317," Merlin, you fool. To place such a trust in children. I swear that you shall rue this day, if you live. ",Classic
27407," I think you have forgotten one thing, gentlemen. ",Classic
469," Oh, all right. ",Classic
158078," Oh, dear. ",Classic
36085," It is now dark. No one will go outside into the Colony. A dangerous man is in hiding. Our patrols have orders to shoot on sight. Happy sleep time, everybody. ",Classic
95826, Nonsense. Clever deception to cover their real motives. ,Classic
60903, Are you trying to kill him? ,Classic
9011, Yes. ,Classic
129723, Doctor! ,Classic
58188," Now, now, now, Jamie. Will power, will power. ",Classic
156731, It's weird. It's like a giant heartbeat. ,Classic
5751, Where is the old man? He is the one who has the key. ,Classic
76096, I managed to destroy their base for you. ,Classic
26297, Oh yes I wish you would. And would you kindly explain to him that I'm quite happy where I am for the moment?,Classic
80919," Not a pleasant change, I'm afraid. He's certain to put you under arrest. ",Classic
93374," The members of the tribunal will arrive in that time. Thank you, Davros, for your cooperation. ",Classic
68918," Well, let him in. ",Classic
33996," Oh, never mind. Go back to Polly, and if the chance comes, get her away from there! Will you do that for me? ",Classic
128155, Time to do what? We don't even know if he's alive in there. ,Classic
86193, I'll call the police.   They're not answering. ,Classic
35771, Oui. ,Classic
118042," The stabiliser, Drax, now! ",Classic
164055, Cholesterol city. ,Classic
50237,"   Not without a permit, you wouldn't. ",Classic
86507," Well, that's where you're wrong, Mike. Someone's there and whoever it is is using vast amounts of power. ",Classic
20424, No. ,Classic
121337," Right, Doctor. ",Classic
118691," It changes the molecular structure of the atmosphere. The atoms become flammable. If the Nova device was activated outside the protective shielding, the atmosphere surrounding this planet would burn up in seconds. ",Classic
41805," Oh, never mind about that. It's Victoria you ought to be worrying about. ",Classic
111879, Let me see that. ,Classic
39014, We can rely on the Doctor to give us all cooperation. ,Classic
10022, Smaller? ,Classic
150231, Are there any defence installations in the area? ,Classic
129565, Enlightenment. ,Classic
16043," What do you think I am? One of these funny things? Yes, well, no space city, Vicki. ",Classic
103813, So the robots won't recognise Dask's voice. They won't obey him.,Classic
128392, What's happening? ,Classic
1160, Providing whoever you send understands the rest of you will be held responsible for his return. ,Classic
79462, Twice round the park? ,Classic
43103," Anyway, thank you. Where were you going? ",Classic
103126," Oh, well I was looking for the Doc. I don't have to explain anything to you. You're just a mechanical man. You're not real. ",Classic
32446, Valmar? No. ,Classic
9428," Oh, don't blame yourself, Barbara. As it happens, everything has turned out very well. Might have taken us ages to find each other. ",Classic
129728, What was all that about? ,Classic
73869, Come with me. ,Classic
75776, The Master is our friend. ,Classic
35882, Hey! ,Classic
103273, Why do you say that? ,Classic
121654, Affirmative. ,Classic
103473," Oh, but you can. You can. ",Classic
92424, Why have they turned the power back on? ,Classic
51045, If we don't get a move on the others will be too tired to even attempt an escape. Have you got any ideas? ,Classic
110362, We must go on. They can still see us here from the Citadel. ,Classic
130176, You see? ,Classic
77210, After them! Fool!,Classic
114022," Yes, but why should this particular circle become a place of prophecy, of augury? You say yourself that there are a dozen or more stone circles in this part of the country. ",Classic
33660," Well, Colonel they're ",Classic
53378," Harsh words, Professor, harsh words. Any progress? So, you haven't yet completed the machine? ",Classic
16006," Pooh! What an awful smell. Well, at least it's not a pool of acid.",Classic
42370, There's something in it. ,Classic
160627," Ah, any sudden noise could cause it to collapse. ",Classic
80310, Do you really believe Andrews couldn't see it? ,Classic
118050," Come on, Merak. ",Classic
50437, Come on. Don't argue. ,Classic
27528, You have the two strangers. Tell them to come here. ,Classic
122843," Doctor, I've lost Teka. ",Classic
104663," What? What! Lee! Lee, I told you to take it out to the carriage! I ordered you! You know the penalty for failing me.   Take the sting of the scorpion. ",Classic
32249," Oh, no! No! ",Classic
137738, You cannot refuse. ,Classic
10206, I think we ought to try in this direction. ,Classic
100367, Five hundred years. That takes us to just about the end of the twentieth century. ,Classic
43544," No, no, no. It's too dangerous! ",Classic
114931, What? ,Classic
95669, Just repeats the same story. ,Classic
59141, Maddie. ,Classic
118745, It is only a matter of time. ,Classic
47939," Are you all right, sir? ",Classic
35808," Nine, ten. Fire.   Again. Fire. ",Classic
46068," Why, yes. I see what you mean. ",Classic
16614, Report. ,Classic
88922," Yes, well, I've got a plan as well. I've got the sonic lance hidden in a cave on Mount Megeshra. It overlooks the Citadel. ",Classic
158961," Come on! Come on, wake up. ",Classic
31122, They've disintegrated! ,Classic
75082, What do you want to do? Listen to Night Ride?,Classic
145918," All right, Jek, the war's over. Will you surrender? ",Classic
16117," Oh, good gracious. ",Classic
75376," And yet you came back here to investigate in person. Interesting. You know, I wonder whether you're telling me the truth. ",Classic
28932," Well, he's a right one. What gear's he got on? ",Classic
11813, You took a chance. ,Classic
94097," You'd better take over the control room, Lester. ",Classic
61752," He knows you, sir. ",Classic
146459, And your companion? ,Classic
36902," Switch them on, Ben. Then stand by to throw the lever. ",Classic
78491," Yes, and we're still trapped in here.",Classic
50494," Right, we shan't be a minute. ",Classic
19822," Yes, that is so. On the other hand, if we don't kill you and you are a spy, the same thing might happen. I propose to place you under arrest. ",Classic
20196," You succeeded beautifully. Thanks, Diomede. ",Classic
70434," What do you want course coordinates for, Doc? You're not thinking of leaving us, are you? ",Classic
96999, Can you tell me where I can find the CO? The Commanding Officer?   I'll tell you what. I won't bother you. ,Classic
20859," One, learn the Dalek plans. ",Classic
100058," There's nothing you can do on your own, Giuliano. ",Classic
122227, I don't see why. ,Classic
112715, Do you know where the Mentiads live? ,Classic
100077, The astrologer Hieronymous. It appears he's moving against me. He's forecast my death. ,Classic
76057," Both, I say! Take them! ",Classic
89375, Listen. ,Classic
147213, How do you know? ,Classic
90187," Mmm, this is good. It's very good. What is it? ",Classic
119143," So, one was interested in you and the painting, and the other in this bracelet. ",Classic
46912," I'm going to make a break for it, sir. ",Classic
33500," Now I must return ashore. I shall expect to see you in London at the end of October. Meanwhile, keep a close eye on Trask. He's not ",Classic
24487," Doctor, look! ",Classic
72419," Yes, I think so. ",Classic
13804, I feel the Zarbi are watching. ,Classic
79491, What is it? Oh! ,Classic
13866, With this. Our wise men designed it for use against the intelligence. ,Classic
162656, Warmsly's the name and I demand to see to somebody in charge. ,Classic
85333, He will not come. He says he's occupied. ,Classic
85679, Brave speech. ,Classic
48458," That was your entire stock of oxygen, was it? ",Classic
96661, Look. You and I when we were boys. ,Classic
68621," Come along, Captain Yates, what are you waiting for? ",Classic
147272, Thanks a lot. ,Classic
133545, What's that? ,Classic
116620, I'm coming! ,Classic
40939," Keep back, Victoria. I can't stop it. ",Classic
152710," When we've finished here, can we take a real holiday? ",Classic
158950, I don't know. Can you see anything? ,Classic
111676," Oh, pay no heed to him. One knows how these fellows exaggerate.",Classic
17138," Yes, perhaps it's something fallen down, or maybe we've changed course. ",Classic
129106," Nothing is more certain, sir. ",Classic
113759, Farm machinery? Huh. ,Classic
101386, But let's see the extract first. ,Classic
45578, Sir? ,Classic
89986," Tuar, No! ",Classic
10948, Is that the one? ,Classic
109837, Amber alert? On me? ,Classic
151889," Oh, why did I ever allow myself to be talked into this folly? ",Classic
125233, He's not for the selection. ,Classic
140727, No. Capture them alive. They must be interrogated first. ,Classic
103689," Well, we'll have to send up a satellite distress beacon to get back to base, but there's no trouble. ",Classic
122873," You, you meddlesome hussy. Do not touch the sacrifices! ",Classic
125738, Time Lords! The ancient enemies! ,Classic
63040, Did the Brigadier get my message? ,Classic
14854," There is something important, sire. If you are able to defeat Saladin in this battle, can you hold the city? ",Classic
104554, Thank you. Are you quite comfortable down there? ,Classic
129328, You chauvinist. I heard that. ,Classic
72089, I'm a witch. ,Classic
147636, But why did the Cybermen need the cold? ,Classic
157783," All right, give it a try. What have we got to lose? Come on, Pex.   Well done, Pex! Going up.",Classic
137178, Turlough again. ,Classic
31109, We can't face them in the dark! ,Classic
182423," Yes, I did. I spent a lot of time with you thinking I was second best, but you know what? I am good. You going to be all right? ",Modern
235153," I told you, love. I'm the Doctor. ",Modern
223294," Oh okay, well, I lost it a tiny bit. ",Modern
196921," Yeah, yeah, right. Get him out of here. And next time, try and find me some funny poor people. ",Modern
172667, We are the same. ,Modern
240752," Shh, Sarah! Down! ",Modern
192108, Argh! ,Modern
178364, Yeah. What is the money? ,Modern
166332, What's so funny? ,Modern
186909, Right.   Come on. The next chapter's this way. ,Modern
221651, Nope. ,Modern
240220, Put you on the very naughty step. Frozen.  ,Modern
208716, But how? ,Modern
186902, Is all right special Time Lord code for really not all right at all? ,Modern
183331, Come with me? ,Modern
188873," What was it? Doctor, what did it do?",Modern
173711, So you'll go soon? You'll leave me? ,Modern
203443," Oh, well, apparently you still do. ",Modern
181829, Ask him yourself. ,Modern
232995, Come on. What's the plan? ,Modern
179104, Just because that Dalek got away. I know what that means to you. Think you'll ever see it again? ,Modern
207791," No, my silent partner. Mister Sweet likes to keep himself to himself. Shall we move on? ",Modern
213490, Absolutely not.   ,Modern
186732, It's making a difference all right. No one's ever going to see my face again. ,Modern
215379, How did you get hold of Time Lord technology?  Who are you?,Modern
216880, So I hear.,Modern
227189," Speak with whom?   Young lady, who are you? ",Modern
239398," Jean, what has got into you?",Modern
181450," Oh, I've had it all my life. Every waking hour. Still, no rest for the wicked. ",Modern
192955," A bit, yeah. ",Modern
230660, Product incoming. ,Modern
237207," What did they do to you, Doctor? How many lives have you had?",Modern
195385," You can see him, too? ",Modern
204206," All right, don't shout. ",Modern
198288," Learn how to drive.   My old fellow didn't see that, did he? He gets ever so cross. ",Modern
196342, You got a blanket. That's good. Who gave you that? ,Modern
227841, Hunt who? ,Modern
171657, I order you to leave her. ,Modern
214702, Shut it!,Modern
190507," Steffi, we'll come get you, okay? We'll come get you! ",Modern
193627, A very good man. The best man I've ever known. ,Modern
204353, Oh. Fine. Of course. ,Modern
196906," Oh, you fibber. Isomorphic. There's no such thing.   These controls are isomorphic. ",Modern
217665, The glass is too thick and they're too far away.  ,Modern
170950, I need ,Modern
232994, How are you doing? Everything go all right?	Apart from being kidnapped. ,Modern
193431, Amy's time. ,Modern
218672, What's that? What's happening? What are those things? ,Modern
212634, I'm not sure yet. I need my memory back. And I think there's only one way to do that. ,Modern
209084, I've no idea where he picks that stuff up. ,Modern
188351," Nothing. The planets rearranged themselves into the optimum pattern. Oh, look at that. Twenty seven planets in perfect balance. Come on, that is gorgeous. ",Modern
194112," No, okay? No, this is real. I'm definitely awake now. ",Modern
197138, Just what I was after. Thank you.,Modern
207256, I'm sorry. ,Modern
167945, Sir. ,Modern
173729," Let's see, then. Judging by the look of you, family man, nice house, decent wage, fought in the war, therefore I represent Queen and country.   Just doing a little check of Her forthcoming Majesty's subjects before the great day. Don't mind if I come in? Nah, I didn't think you did. Thank you.",Modern
222033," Surely they want to conquer the Earth, not blow  it up. ",Modern
237978," I know, but I'm good at this. And I'm only chatting. I make your punters happy. What's the point of being alive if it's not to make others happy?  ",Modern
233600, The authorities won't be any help. ,Modern
190966, You what? ,Modern
205949, Why don't I have the internet?,Modern
172773, We can't use the Tardis. We're part of events now. ,Modern
227880," All right, it's a work in progress, but so is life. It'll be fine. Oh! I got these downstairs. One must work.   You can figure out how to work a crane, right? Go.   Yep, way too high.",Modern
208269, Power line for the park. ,Modern
187332," That thing, whatever it is, killed the driver, and the mechanic, and I don't think she's finished yet. ",Modern
231954," This reality's collapsing, Graham! ",Modern
176427, I think this is the on switch.,Modern
198746," Very, very deep.   And somebody's knocking.   Oh, come here. Come here, you scrumptious little beauty. ",Modern
182968, Kill him. ,Modern
190124, Go on. ,Modern
172614, Is this like normal for you? Is this an average day? ,Modern
205280,"  Actually, it's you they can't give up, Doctor. And I don't think they should. Go with him. Go save every world you can find. Who else has that chance? Life will still be here.",Modern
226177, Yes. Probably some devious plan. That sounds about right. ,Modern
178054," Brooklyn turnoff two, closed. ",Modern
209255,"   Oh, you've redecorated. I don't like it. ",Modern
224872, It's everyone's. 11.57 PM. ,Modern
237660," I connected myself into the neural network. I inserted myself into the organisation, into every network. I located this place, created it.  Every piece of equipment, every idea behind it... I did that. ",Modern
175370," I'm busy. Unless you want me to draw you, mum. ",Modern
188430, Right. Yes. Course I will. I'll just go and get you the key. ,Modern
185168, Just brilliant. ,Modern
210536, Doctor?,Modern
210814," Shoot him, bag him and throw him outside. ",Modern
229490," Look at you. My fam. No, still doesn't quite work. Team Tardis? ",Modern
180485," Matron, is that so? ",Modern
179410, What're you going to do with that? ,Modern
234811," Okay. In 1216, the cathedral hosted the coronation of King Henry III, and he was only nine at the time. They filmed Harry Potter here, too. ",Modern
184598, No. ,Modern
186305," Sorry, you didn't sign your personal experience contracts. ",Modern
224287, Just tell me a joke before you go.    Just tell me a joke! He didn't tell me a joke. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Mum! Answer me! ,Modern
197764," Eek! Oh, my God. What is that? Is that a mask? Is that a Star Trek thing? Ben, is that you? ",Modern
178719, But you have doubts. ,Modern
180589," Show me, little boy. ",Modern
210952," This is gun girl. She's got a gun, and she's a girl. This is a sort of boss one. Are you the same one as before?",Modern
187307, Maybe that's why it went for her. ,Modern
169124, What happens if they touch us? ,Modern
174151," I copied it from fragments we found unearthed by the drilling, but I can't translate it. ",Modern
210709, There's no trace of him in the wreckage. They searched all Parliament Hill. Where else would he go?  I fear we have missed him.,Modern
188607, It's like an outer space Facebook. ,Modern
235321, I don't think they're too keen on visitors. ,Modern
197782, It's my phone. ,Modern
198474, You can't send me back. It's too late. We're a hundred miles from home. ,Modern
193789," Er, that we pretend you're an applicant for the school to get you inside, and tonight you come down and open the trapdoor to let us in. ",Modern
228834, Thirty minutes? ,Modern
198532, The space we travel in. The ocean. Sort of ocean but not water. The Tardis can't see. It's sulking because it thinks the space doesn't exist. Without a plane to lock onto we're not going anywhere. ,Modern
237199, What have you done? ,Modern
204940, Somebody's got to water the plants. Just bring them back safe. ,Modern
176563, No way. That box is too weird. ,Modern
189078, Is Mum there?,Modern
171296, Nothing. I don't know. ,Modern
194779," Oh, for goodness sake. All right, then. Come on. ",Modern
231968," You think words can do it justice? It's really big... and incredibly beautiful. And, apparently, I've just said goodbye to it.  But the thing I'm going to miss the most is the people. My friends.  ",Modern
169421," Well, by his time, you lot have spread out across half the galaxy. ",Modern
241288, Your family's oath across the centuries. It wasn't just a statue. It was hiding the keystone! ,Modern
187993," Hey! Firing at the car is not so good. You, you crazy or what? ",Modern
210652," Right, here we are. This is the place. Come with me.",Modern
233571," Kneel. Kneel, or they all die.   Call me by my name.  ",Modern
176051, Here come the ghosts. ,Modern
203243," Come on. This way, girl. You can do it, you can do it! Excellent driving! Hello! ",Modern
219617," Oh, the human race.",Modern
230828," Charlie, what are you doing up here? ",Modern
226749," Is that it?   I really wouldn't harm you, you know. ",Modern
179997, I'm sorry. ,Modern
202314, Doctor? ,Modern
166756," I've tried to make sense of it, sir. Consulted with spiritualists, table rappers, all sorts. ",Modern
181045," Of course he can't hear us. Look, I've got a transcript. See? Everything he says. Yup, that's me. Yes, I do. Yup, and this. Next it's",Modern
227597, Shame. I'm looking for a doctor.,Modern
235357, Right. Let's put him down. ,Modern
219230, Let us help you. ,Modern
212734," I dunno. Every time I see you, it's like you're  ",Modern
232873," Er, probably. ",Modern
187036, Claude. I'm the mechanic. Trainee. ,Modern
169262, Door.   Damn it! ,Modern
195274, Exactly? ,Modern
167891, The cameras in the vault have gone down. ,Modern
186527, Donna Noble has left The Library. Donna Noble has been saved. ,Modern
173756," Oh ho ho ho. I bet she did. Anyway, I'm the Doctor and this is Rose, and you are? ",Modern
213393," Maybe they've been there all the time. It's warmish. They're multiplying, feeding, evolving.   ",Modern
225461," If there's fire, there's got to be oxygen. ",Modern
200926, What? ,Modern
209628, You see that? Gallifrey is my home. I know it when I see it. That is not Gallifrey. ,Modern
179869, Ashton's still out there.  Mc ,Modern
196757, Remember what? Doctor? Doctor?,Modern
220665, How about we just don't? Why don't we just fly away somewhere?  ,Modern
221486, Mmm. What do you think of the towers? ,Modern
213470, Nothing.  ,Modern
234591, We know you want the Orb. Let her go. ,Modern
196160, How long do we have? ,Modern
239960," Precisely, sir. A dozen doorways, a dozen worlds. Except the past few days have changed everything. ",Modern
230292, I don't want to talk about that. ,Modern
233995, Please do not enter the Tranquillity steam room during this routine drill. ,Modern
235681, But how does the alien bacteria end up in the Indian Ocean in the first place? ,Modern
185548," It's the date. Assuming the first two numbers are some big old space date, then you've got year, month, day. It's the other way round, like it is in America ",Modern
177873," Take me back. Whoever you are, just take me back to my friend. That's all I want. I won't cause any trouble. Just take me back. ",Modern
182357, We've got control of the Valiant. You can't launch. ,Modern
239552, Yeah. Nothing to worry about.,Modern
211416,"This, er, is Alan-a-Dale. He's a master of the lute, whose music brightens up these dark days.",Modern
215142, Where are we?,Modern
181260, I was busy. ,Modern
231453, In the earth... ,Modern
216543," These are Christmas hats, I've seen people use them. You put them on and absolutely anything seems funny. ",Modern
190484," Captain! Get back! Get back! Captain! Don't touch it, Roman. Get back. Get back. ",Modern
214547," Yeah, but we saved the world, right? ",Modern
207675, I don't know. I say stuff. Ignore me. Do you feel safe? ,Modern
182845, They're getting nearer. ,Modern
193946, Where? ,Modern
236683," Hey, do you hear that sound? ",Modern
213262,Ah ha. We should be bouncing about this cabin like little fluffy clouds. But we're not. What is the matter with the moon?  ,Modern
177593," Who is this Doctor? Why does he come now at our time of glory? Doomfinger, transport yourself. Doom the Doctor. Doom his hide. ",Modern
173389, We can't just go strolling up. ,Modern
169377, For what? ,Modern
208351, Yeah. Silly of me. ,Modern
226133, We need to get out of here. Now! ,Modern
185827," Oh, but you are wonderful. Now, just stop. Stop there. ",Modern
221595, What happens if I panic? ,Modern
196004," No, I'm way too much for this ship. My hand touches that panel, the planet doesn't blow up, the whole solar system does. ",Modern
167517, They did last time. ,Modern
187621, And now it wants us. ,Modern
224751, So you're blind and you don't want your enemies to know.,Modern
196632," Run, run! Move, move. Go! ",Modern
178007," Tell me, how long have you been driving on the motorway? ",Modern
238228, Just because we have to save them doesn't mean I have to like him. They're infuriating.  ,Modern
189588, And what's your name? ,Modern
238793, We're gonna to ram them. ,Modern
196161, Hours at the most. ,Modern
220988, He'll just know. ,Modern
204609, I don't doubt that.,Modern
235649, Come on! ,Modern
206778," Ready, Clara? ",Modern
189840, It's the bus. Number two hundred. They mean the bus. ,Modern
216556," Oh, hundreds. I just wish there were time for a few more. ",Modern
225540," Looks like old Friday came good after all, eh? ",Modern
224260, How long will that take? ,Modern
192290, Can't we shut that ruddy thing up? ,Modern
183849," Well, we can't go back. ",Modern
227864," Well, I will have by the time we get to the top. ",Modern
183959," Well, no idea. I'm checking the equipment. Nothing so far. ",Modern
237743, All that product. Maybe I can make a claim on insurance. ,Modern
204721, Full time? Blimey. Er. ,Modern
209976," Clara Oswald, I will never send you away again. ",Modern

198954," It's your fault, isn't it, sweets? Because you told House it was the last Tardis. House can't feed on them if there's none more coming, can he? ",Modern
178618, I needed to see you. ,Modern
209607, You can't keep using the Tardis like this. ,Modern
198486, Wait with the boy. ,Modern
204813," No. I mean, we haven't made a decision. ",Modern
237230, I've already lived longer than I expected. There must be a few last things I can blow up before I'm done.,Modern

168773, Mummy? ,Modern
201038," All right, but you said ",Modern
224609," Cardinal, it worked. I can see. Not well enough, not yet. The thing about the universe is, whatever you need, you can always borrow,  as long as you pay it back. I just borrowed from my future. I get a few minutes of proper eyesight, but I lose something. Maybe all my future  regenerations will be blind. Maybe I won't regenerate ever again. Maybe I'll drop dead in twenty minutes. But I will be able to read this!   Now, I have no idea how that is going to affect me, so I'd be a bit stupid to reject the precautions provided. Could you help me, please?  Could you help me?   You know, I've read a lot of books that this chair would be quite useful for. Moby Dick. Honestly, shut up, and get to the whale.   You invited friends and family?   Oh, it's the old, old story. They never look so good in the morning.   Goodbye to the truth? I came a long way to read that book! Two thousand years at the last count. If you don't want me to read it,  you could have stopped me any time you wanted. Why the play acting? This is not a game. ",Modern
183103," Which plant, that plant? ",Modern
178152," A new chemical. A new mood. They called it Bliss. Everyone tried it. They couldn't stop. A virus mutated inside the compound and became airborne. Everything perished. Even the virus, in the end. It killed the world in seven minutes flat. There was just enough time to close down the walkways and the flyovers, sealing off the under-city. Those people on the motorway aren't lost, Doctor. They were saved. ",Modern
233943, Relax. This is a routine Tranquillity drill.  HYPH3 ,Modern
184355," Now, I can't prove anything, but there's got to be a link. I need you to check out all the people who died in ATMOS cars yesterday, and then check out the time. ",Modern
196827, Yes. ,Modern
193200," No, it's a time bomb. Well, it's a death trap and a time bomb. And now it's a dead end. Nobody panic. Oh, just me then. What's through here? ",Modern
220907, Stop shouting a minute if you want to go face-up. ,Modern
194948," Right. Preferred it when I didn't know, to be honest. ",Modern
229033, Let me tell you about this mess. ,Modern
229721, With that creature. ,Modern
236066," Well, I think the motivational speech needs a bit of work, Doc, if you don't... And also a plan, by the way. ",Modern
238810, They were retreating! It was done. ,Modern
236243, What's his problem? ,Modern
192764," Okay. I've mapped the probability vectors, done a fold-back on the temporal isometry, charted the ship to its destination, and parked us right along side. ",Modern

167661, We're just idiots. ,Modern
225833, Ooo. What could do that? ,Modern
191571, But what are you doing here? Where's Amelia? ,Modern
169363," Oh, I do. She was gorgeous. Like I told her, be back in five minutes. ",Modern
234550, Tell me about this Wardenclyffe project. ,Modern
193885, Ah ha! ,Modern
216365," All right. As the Doctor might say,   Oh, it's all a bit dreamy-weamy. ",Modern
193504, Something's happening. Pedro was here a second ago and now you can't even remember him. ,Modern
216573," So, all of time and all of space is sitting out there. A big blue box. Please, don't even argue. ",Modern
193079," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up. ",Modern

188228," Martha, look at the sky. ",Modern

195484, Doing anything? ,Modern
234723," No, no. ",Modern

180274," That's exactly the problem, sir. They only have spears. ",Modern

Not until you tell us what's going on here. Urgh, don't like the look of your hands. It's all bubbling away inside you, isn't it?  Oh no, you're not filling me. If you're that desperate for it, here, have it.   Oh. Delightful. Down the hatch. I've got so many questions right now, like, did you drink that or absorb it?

217181," There's no such thing as the Doctor. I'm just a bloke in a box, telling stories. And I didn't come here because I'm ashamed. A bit of shame never hurt anyone.

Those images, they were buried deep in the Matrix. Tecteun put a visual filter over it so that no one who watched it  would find it remarkable. I transmitted them into your mind as you tracked the Cybermen. Maybe this is the last gift of a parent.  A clue. Or an apology. You can decide. Did Tecteun leave these images for you to decode one day?",Modern

183127," No, I feel fantastic. It's a new lease of life. Now, what do you think about these earrings. Do they work? ",Modern
204512, But I think we should put aside what he did and find another solution. ,Modern

237145," Now, having seen her adopted child regenerate her body, Tecteun, a scientist and explorer, had a new landscape to explore.  She dedicated her life to studying her child. Detailed every fragment of genetic material. It took her years. Several of the child's  regenerations. Tecteun grew older. Her desire to understand became an obsession. She worked tirelessly, endlessly, furiously.  She had to crack this code to understand regeneration. And finally, she did. And to prove herself right, she took the ultimate risk.  Tested the theory on herself. Put her own life on the line. Spliced into herself the genetic ability to regenerate.  I didn't know any of this. Did you know any of this? Nearly there. The planet of Gallifrey evolved. Shobogans grew in knowledge and ability.  They built themselves the Citadel. They discovered the ability to travel through Time as well as space. With Tecteun, they became a self-appointed ruling elite.  And Tecteun proposed that they gene-splice the ability to regenerate into future generations of Citadel dwellers. It would become the genetic inheritance of them  and their descendants. But he would restrict the regenerative process to a maximum of twelve times. The timeless child became the base genetic code  for all Gallifreyans within the Citadel. The civilisation which renamed themselves, with characteristic pomposity, Time Lords.  The foundling had become the founder. The rest, as they say, is history. ",Modern

186802, Of course you're real. You're as real as anything. Why do you say that? ,Modern
230051, Or Ryan Graham. ,Modern
176234," But it's a lie. Temperatures have risen by two degrees in the past six months. The ice caps are melting. They're saying all this is going to be flooded. That's not just global warming, is it? ",Modern
193244," Doctor, quickly. ",Modern
198818," I'm, I'm. Big word, sad word. Why is that word so sad? No. Will be sad. Will be sad.",Modern

Now, leave this planet in peace! In peace. ",Modern
169252, Could've used a warning. ,Modern
228817, How are we supposed to keep history in order if James Blake is going to go fishing at Mill Creek and another driver is lined up to do his route? ,Modern
178910, The solar flare is imminent. The radiation will reach Earth in a matter of minutes. ,Modern
223291," It certainly appears to be producing fuel suitable for interstellar travel. Either way, Bill, I need you to leave the talking to me.  ",Modern

192139, How does a mouth have an eject button? ,Modern
208348," You're smart and you're beautiful, and I've never met anyone like you before. And being Emperor won't be as hard if you're by my side. And you'd rule a thousand galaxies. ",Modern
210251, Door. Boring. Not me.  Me.,Modern
215119," Could we have some coffee along here, please? The good kind. We've got a new one.   Five minutes, tops. Best to wait for the good coffee.",Modern

169954, I might've known. ,Modern
229755, Urgh. How does that work?   Do you want to see my baby pics? ,Modern
201378," And these Temporal Engines mess up the Handbots' sensors. So, where's the Temporal Engines? ",Modern
207016, Assistant. ,Modern
214687," This is a sonic screwdriver. It interacts with any form of communication you care to mention. Sadly, trees have no moving parts and don't communicate.",Modern

231761," No Erik, no sonic.  ",Modern

210823," You know what it does, then?",Modern
189529," I certainly will. Merry Christmas to you, Jackson. ",Modern
187117," Nah, it's cast iron, that door. ",Modern
187339, She's still doing it. Just stop it. Stop talking. Stop it! ,Modern
193088," Snapped my neck, sir. Wasn't as painless as I expected, but it was pretty quick, so that was something. ",Modern
171553, They were born sick. They're meant to be sick. They exist to be sick. Lab rats. No wonder the Sisters have got a cure for everything. They've built the ultimate research laboratory. A human farm. ,Modern
186943, There you go.   That's the headphones for channels one to thirty six. Modem link for 3D vidgames. Complimentary earplugs. Complimentary slippers. Complimentary juice pack and complimentary peanuts. I must warn you some products may contain nuts. ,Modern
239827," You judge me for giving you the journey of your lifetime. What do you do, Doctor? Pick people up, take them with you? You adopt them, use them, for reassurance,    for company. They're your experiments, just as you were mine.  ",Modern

172578, Reinette? Just checking you're okay. ,Modern
178696," Oh, that must have roasted up your power cells, huh? Time was, four Daleks could have conquered the world, but instead you're skulking away, hidden in the dark, experimenting. All of which results in you. ",Modern
182341, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. ,Modern
183969, I can't find a source. All the bacterial scans register negative. ,Modern
203017, It's the best tree in the world. ,Modern
198584," Any reflection, any mirror, and the siren will attack. We have to protect Rory and Toby. Go and get the crown from the storeroom. ",Modern

217162, You neither.,Modern
198452," Well, thank God we're not in the middle of the ocean. ",Modern

216630, Except? ,Modern
231089," Yeah, but what's the party for? ",Modern
182183," That's why I came to find you. Know your enemy. I've got this.   No one's been able to look at a sphere close up. They can't even be damaged, except once. The lightning strike in South Africa brought one of them down, just by chance. I've got the readings on this. ",Modern
174272, He is awake. ,Modern
197068, A cool one. ,Modern
234195," Oh, you're going to die. It's just whether I shoot and kill you now, or wound you and leave you to the Dregs. ",Modern
233773, I don't understand. ,Modern

171711, Wouldn't it just. I got the impression there was something you wanted to tell me. ,Modern
182210, It knows you. ,Modern
168427, No. What do you mean? ,Modern
229514, Where are we?  ,Modern
189265, Infostamp with a Cyclo-Steinham core. You ripped open the core and broke the safety. Zap! Only the Doctor would think of that. ,Modern
195757, Bit of a mess. ,Modern
195252, What? It's not. There's nothing to be suspicious about. ,Modern
235333, She vanished. And you are the only other person out here.  ,Modern

169206," He cuts himself shaving, he does half an hour on life forms he's cleverer than. ",Modern
192801, Not me. ,Modern
223727," Doctor, you're provoking it. It's getting louder!  ",Modern
219023," Somebody once caught the briefest of glimpses of a Zygon in its proper form. A child who hadn't learned to preserve its body print, who had been left alone to learn these things for itself. And then word went round these primitives that we were monsters. ",Modern
219676, They're under my command. I owe it to them. ,Modern
206516, Possibly. Probably. There usually seems to be. ,Modern

229579, Four days. ,Modern
197254, It doesn't have to be exactly the same. ,Modern
227930," Poor Tim Shaw. The wannabe leader who has to cheat because he knows he's unworthy. See, that's why I know you won't detonate.  Although, you could prove me wrong cos we're all capable of the most incredible change. We can evolve while still staying true to who we are.  We can honour who we've been and choose who we want to be next. Now's your chance. How about it? ",Modern
229109, Look at the size of it! ,Modern
205656, You blushed. And we just. Shut up. ,Modern
240020," I have located your Tardis, Doctor.  ",Modern

206363," It is. It so completely is. But wait, there is more. ",Modern
202860, So you're going to do this? Let them all think you're dead? ,Modern
223207, What? ,Modern
224402, He is here. He's standing right in front of us. ,Modern
222387, How is that possible? How do you do that?,Modern
185134," And I will. Never do tomorrow what you can do today, my mum says, because ",Modern
226784," What do you mean, used to be? ",Modern
219388," Well, it wouldn't be right, would it? ",Modern
204113," Why are the dinosaurs still on board, and why is the ship coming back to Earth? It doesn't make sense. What's changed between then and now? Wait. Computer, show me the ship at launch with all life signals. Now show me the ship today with all life signals. Thousands less. But why? Show me both images, then and now, side by side. ",Modern
233746, What have you done? ,Modern
223510, Okay. ,Modern

223245," Why all the fuss? It's just mud from the river, isn't it?  ",Modern
187700, What sort of a man are you? Come on. ,Modern
195597," I mean, we've got plans. ",Modern
222250," I love this place, don't you? ",Modern
180340," She works at the school, and whatever's happening seems to centred round that establishment. The faintest of traces, but they all lead back there. ",Modern
225917," Ooo! Ooo! No, but",Modern
198887," Doctor, what are you talking about?",Modern
197489," Yeah. I've explained the jokes.   So what are you saying? Do you really think he's back there, trying to wave to us, out of history books? ",Modern
195502," Well, yes. Might be interesting to know his side of the story. Yes, though maybe he's not really in the mood for conversation right at this precise moment.   Well, no harm trying. Listen. Listen! I know you can understand me, even though I know you won't understand why you can understand me. I also know that no one's talked to you for a pretty long stretch, but please, listen. I also don't belong on this planet. I also am alone. If you trust me, I'm sure we can come to some kind of, you know, understanding. And then, and then, who knows? ",Modern
206245," Doctor, help me. I don't know where I am. ",Modern
210844, I know your type.,Modern
218283," Doctor, what's wrong with your face? ",Modern
225763, I'll put the story in the stone. ,Modern

226024, What was that? ,Modern
191238, AWhitepoint star is only found on one planet. Gallifrey. Which means it's the Time Lords. The Time Lords are returning. ,Modern

192322, I rang you a month ago. ,Modern
221218," I beg of you, not my head! ",Modern
223700, Or both. ,Modern
207713," Oh yes, dear. You'll do very nicely. ",Modern
228215, Or maybe they're not feeding the battery properly. ,Modern
176502, What? ,Modern
192393," We are waging total war, Doctor. Day after day the Luftwaffe pound this great city like an iron fist. ",Modern
166471, Heat levels critical. ,Modern
170648," Listen to me. God knows I have hated that man, but right now, I love him and do you know why? Because he did the right thing. He sent you back to me. ",Modern
179067," If they will not obey, then they must die. ",Modern
192027, We're under orders to tell her.,Modern
237709, Something you never want to do.  ,Modern
195560, You've turned out to be the first doctor ever actually to make a difference to my life. ,Modern
196773, Are you just saying yes because you're scared of me? ,Modern
188778, Let her go! ,Modern
195954," And you, Miss Pond, nearly get thrown off into the Vortex. ",Modern
171239, Yes. ,Modern
183045," I think one or two inconvenient truths might come to light. Still, it's my own fault, and ten years in jail is better than dying. ",Modern
188892," I've got you. That makes three of us, and three is all we need.",Modern
191409, From the man over there. ,Modern
202798," Shut up! I can't let you die without knowing you are loved by so many, and so much, and by no one more than me. ",Modern
186588, It doesn't have a red setting. ,Modern
168347," I started without you. This is fascinating. Satellite Five contains every piece of information within the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire. Birth certificates, shopping habits, bank statements, but you two, you don't exist. Not a trace. No birth, no job, not the slightest kiss. How can you walk through the world and not leave a single footprint? ",Modern
201609," Okay, this is weird. Right, just stop doing that. ",Modern
218905, Have you seen her? ,Modern
236966, Open the comms channel. ,Modern
182780," Mister van Hoff, I know we've only just met, but you'll have to excuse me. ",Modern
172387, They've taken all the children! ,Modern
206922," No, please. ",Modern
166452, I bet you were the school swot and never got kissed. At arms! ,Modern
179595," Korwin, Ashton? Where are you? Korwin, can you answer? Where the hell is he? He should be up here. ",Modern
234620, Our ship. Our weapons. Everything.,Modern
192723," Wrong. Wrong. Bit right, mostly wrong. I love museums. ",Modern
218352," Yeah, well, why don't you show your face? At least I show my face. What's wrong with yours? ",Modern
185167, He's a genius. ,Modern
236150, Did I interrupt? Am I interrupting? ,Modern
217552, It's just what I was saying. You live and you die. That's it. The ghosts are aberrations. A splinter of time in the skin. They're unnatural. She wants to get away from them.  ,Modern
200011, Send a telegram to Inspector Abberline of the yard. Jack the Ripper has claimed his last victim. ,Modern
168312, He is no one. ,Modern
234368, Teleport occupancy exceeded. ,Modern
231277," Just mud. No sign of any tendency to tendril. Shouldn't be disappointed, but I am a bit. ",Modern
183253," What do you mean, the bees are disappearing? ",Modern
238719, It's me Mam's. For hitting them on the probic thingy. ,Modern
172640," Then it kills everyone in the room. Focuses the mind, doesn't it? Who are you? Identify yourself. Order it to answer me. ",Modern
201093," Rory. Panicking, a bit. ",Modern
221462, No. Just the wind. ,Modern
232439, You do realise this means those drawings could be true. The Battle of Hope Valley. ,Modern
218785, Walsh coming through.WALSH ,Modern
199487," That's it, Doctor befriend them. Team up with them, why don't you? Make a football team. How about that? You're going to have us all together singing campfire songs. ",Modern
184722, Why's it not working? ,Modern
176617, Listen to me. You've got to jump. ,Modern
210234, Shut up.,Modern
227170, Well of course you understand. I am your future self. ,Modern
228227, Don't take him personally. He treats everyone like this. ,Modern
223965," Oh God, it's standing for him? ",Modern
217289, How did you get it back?,Modern
187006, Yeah. I had a friend who went to a different universe. ,Modern
211887," Well, I couldn't have written it and forgotten, could I?",Modern
186428," I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry. But you've got two shadows.   It's how they hunt. They latch on to a food source and keep it fresh. ",Modern
204402, You ain't carrying any food. Just three more mouths to feed. We'll all die even sooner now. ,Modern
207052, She knows I'm here. I can feel her calling out to me. ,Modern
186675," Professor, go ahead. Find a safe spot. ",Modern
216159, They can detect their own mental picture in any nearby mind. ,Modern
187860, Rhinos? ,Modern
222201, You what? ,Modern
196441, The cracks in time are the work of the Doctor. It is confirmed. ,Modern
234600, It certainly is... a lot. But you take it in your stride. Where do you even come from? ,Modern
230958, I'm never doing that again. ,Modern
232647, Are you kidding? ,Modern
174170, What is it? What's wrong? ,Modern
166375, I'm afraid not. ,Modern
180232," Well, don't spread it about, I don't want your germs. Come on, might as well get some sleep. Come on, chaps. Maybe tomorrow. Jackson's got some beer in the pavilion. ",Modern
198798," No, no, Idris. I think you should have a rest. ",Modern
210768, Ah. You'll fit right in.   Scottish.,Modern
209262, We are armed. You may not. ,Modern
200643," Okay. So, basically better regenerate, that's what you're saying. ",Modern
170534, Since when did the Daleks have a concept of blasphemy? ,Modern
206191," Sorry, no, it's nothing. It's just, you're a nanny. Isn't that a bit, well, Victorian? ",Modern
183805," Yes, down there. Why can't this lot predict a volcano? Why is it being hidden? ",Modern
193218, Including the lights. All of them. I'll need to turn out the lights. ,Modern
181190, Whoa! What's that? ,Modern
208539," No. When a Tardis is dying, sometimes the dimension dams start breaking down. They used to call it a size leak. All the bigger on the inside starts leaking to the outside. It grows. When I say that's the Tardis, I don't mean it looks like the Tardis, I mean it actually is the Tardis. My Tardis from the future. What else would they bury me in?",Modern
190867, Mum? ,Modern
201982," Rory, can you give us two minutes? Two minutes? ",Modern
193293, The Angels are wondering what you hope to achieve. ,Modern
236675," See? We're gonna be all right. Yedlarmi.   And Fuskle. Well, give him your hand, then.  If you're not going to speak, at least give him your hand. ",Modern
178968, Laszlo? What is it? ,Modern
236806," First thing my dad taught me. How to hijack cyber ships, how to take 'em apart, how to burn 'em to the ground. I was four. ",Modern
188510," Not now, Captain. And Martha Jones",Modern
174504, What do you think? ,Modern
240662, They're what? ,Modern
221189, And could you either sit down or fetch us the wine list or something? ,Modern
219710," Doctor, that door isn't going to last much longer. ",Modern
175219, Is it me or is he a bit Slitheen? ,Modern
177294," Well, do something! Stop it! ",Modern
170459, The Dalek stratagem nears completion. The fleet is almost ready. You will not intervene. ,Modern
169207, There are these children living rough round the bomb sites. They come out during air-raids looking for food. ,Modern
184984, What? I told you not to launch. ,Modern
167409," Buffalo. Two Fs, one L. ",Modern
184436," Zero? No carbon, none at all? ",Modern
179954, Purple! Or did I say orange? ,Modern
179300," Ah, Doctor. ",Modern
177650, I'm sorry. You'll get a refund. But this play must not be performed. ,Modern
214040," Listen, what I said ",Modern
240651," From now on, I'm in charge of the plans. And there's always another way out somehow. You just have to find it. ",Modern
236428, Are you the Guardian? ,Modern
226667," Yeah, we could have been up and down the stairs all night. ",Modern
197067, Because they're scary.  DOCTOR; Good answer.   What kind of tie is that? ,Modern
219770," I've been working on Morpheus for a very long time, Doctor.  I had to start somewhere. Morpheus's first client. Patient Zero. The ultimate Wide-Awake. Inside there is a man who hasn't slept in five years. ",Modern
210262,That came from the river.,Modern
166370, But there's no one from the Corporation on board. ,Modern
189358," Yeah, but that's because your database got corrupted. Oh, look, look, look. Check this. The Doctor's infostamp.   Plug it in. Go on. Download. ",Modern
176461, Online and locked. ,Modern
195536," How come I'm the crazy one, and you two have stayed sane?",Modern
227283, Why am I wearing these? ,Modern
231692, I'll do everything I can. ,Modern
207561," Two bionic eyes and a synthetic voice box. But you, my friend, are human. Flesh and blood. ",Modern
209089, Long live the Queen. ,Modern
193211," Clerics, keep watching them. ",Modern
180588, Nothing. ,Modern
223339, elp!   ,Modern
193146, There's always a way out. ,Modern
197608, Who's Jim the fish? ,Modern
220799,"   This might be an alarming question in the circumstance, but you really do think I'm a surgeon, don't you? ",Modern
170921, How can it be me? ,Modern
225082, How did you do that? What is that thing? ,Modern
211743, Hiya!,Modern
192753, River? ,Modern
171825," She's a feral child. I bought her for sixpence in old London Town. It's was her or the Elephant Man, so ",Modern
175591," It's a spaceship. Not a council spaceship, I'm afraid. ",Modern
171992," And should I trust you, sir? You who change your voice so easily? What happened to your accent? ",Modern
190964," Oh, I can see again! He's gone. ",Modern
219696, They evolve. You said so yourself.,Modern
172939," Oh, so it's just Rose, then? Nothing out there to tempt me? ",Modern
201259, Will you be visiting long? ,Modern
233389, I'm going! I'm going! ,Modern
219293,"That's what's in the red box, yes? Of course it is. If I remember rightly, it causes a chain reaction in the atmosphere. Turns every Zygon on Earth inside out. ",Modern
179161, You're joking. ,Modern
216316, Isotope. ,Modern
181228," What, do you know him? ",Modern
184101," Is it just me, or does it feel as if it's looking at you? ",Modern
175914," But if I'm the enemy, does that mean that I'm a prisoner? ",Modern
175717, Any second now. ,Modern
226655," So, I imagine you're the next one along, then? ",Modern
223083," Well, why didn't you say something? ",Modern
223778, Get him out! ,Modern
202537, Silence will fall when the question is asked. ,Modern
176209," You could be. Whatever's inside that Ark is waking up, and I've seen this happen before.   The first time I saw a Dalek, it was broken. It was dying. But I touched it. The moment I did that, I brought it back to life.   As the Doctor said, when you travel in time in the Tardis, you soak up all this background radiation. It's harmless. It's just there. But in the Time War, the Daleks evolved so they could use it as a power supply. ",Modern
177126, I'm sorry? ,Modern
184236, Just shoot them. Shoot to kill! ,Modern
179108, The end of the line. No place like it. ,Modern
198530, It can't get a lock on the plane. ,Modern
176673," Anyway, enough of my CV. Come on, it's time to face the consequences. Oh, this is going to be so shaming. You can do the explaining, Martian boy. ",Modern
167566, We don't. We stay here. ,Modern
220286,Who the hell does he think he is?' ,Modern
222858," Okay, on my way. ",Modern
220160," I do. Listen, if this is the last I ever see of you, please, not like this.       Is there anything you can do?  ",Modern
202807," Amy, uncuff me now. Okay, I need a strip of cloth about a foot long. Anything will do. Never mind.   River, take one end of this. Wrap it around your hand, and hold it out to me. ",Modern
233580," You, Barton, and a race you barely know? That's one uneasy alliance. Trust each other, do you? ",Modern
240998," What did you mean, when you said your actions were catching up with you? ",Modern
223666, Do you fancy him? ,Modern
224965," Please, stop. Just stop this. ",Modern
227016, Right. Come on. Let's go and find the others. ,Modern
215707, Yeah.,Modern
189156, But she was better with you. ,Modern
238848, Yes. Five. ,Modern
233228," I think it's laughing at you, Doc. ",Modern
202164," You've not noticed anything unusual around here lately, Val? ",Modern
207444, Everything? ,Modern
192895, Don't take your eyes off it. Keep looking. It can't move if you're looking. ,Modern
209883, I can't. ,Modern
193063, They don't look like Angels. ,Modern
193643, Well. ,Modern
193620," Yeah, for now. But the explosion that caused it is still happening. Somewhere out there, somewhere in time. ",Modern
169881, Dinner in bondage. Works for me. ,Modern
178895," So tell me, where did you and him first hook up? ",Modern
203772," Don't you dare talk to me about waiting outside a box, because that is nothing, Rory, nothing, compared to giving you up. ",Modern
224275, What do you mean? ,Modern
232987," Ah, there's the blockage. Oh, sorry! Group message. Got to concentrate. Just calling to say hi, fam. Where are you? We said an hour. You're late.  Very late. All of you.   Hi, fellas. Rocking the ominous look. ",Modern
182185, So is that why you travelled the world? To find a disc? ,Modern
199401, It's hot.   Trans-matter's still a little rubbery. Nerve endings not quite fused properly. ,Modern
194795, How far down are we? ,Modern
202084," Nobody panic, but I appear to be losing control. ",Modern
214457," There's a ladder at the end of this. If we get down into the tunnel, we can make it into daylight. ",Modern
207072," Yes. Yes, Carlisle. Ignorance is Carlisle. ",Modern
231941," Oh, I think you know. ",Modern
219240," There it is, Osgood. There's their plan. ",Modern
184715, But what are you doing? ,Modern

200132, You what? ,Modern
182089," Doctor, if I told you the truth, your hearts would break. ",Modern

204948, Hello? Hello?   What the?   Hello? Anyone home?   Hello?   Who are you? ,Modern
195450," Yes. While I may be mad, I'm not stupid. ",Modern
201795," I'm sorry. Daddy, I'm so sorry.   Praise him.",Modern
176663, Bit quick to get married. ,Modern

Once, long ago, a fisherman caught a magic haddock. The haddock offered the fisherman three wishes in return for its life. The fisherman said, ""I'd like my son to come home from the war, and a hundred pieces of gold."" The problem is magic haddock, like robots, don't think like people. The fisherman's son came home from the war in a coffin and the King sent a hundred gold pieces in recognition of his heroic death.  The fisherman had one wish left. What do you think he wished for?    Some people say he should have wished for an infinite series of wishes, but if your city proves anything, it is that granting all your wishes is not a good idea.

168361," That thing, as you put it, is in charge of the human race. For almost a hundred years, mankind has been shaped and guided, his knowledge and ambition strictly controlled by it's broadcast news, edited by my superior, your master, and humanity's guiding light, the Mighty Jagrafess of the Holy Hadrojassic Maxarodenfoe. I call him Max.   Create a climate of fear and it's easy to keep the borders closed. It's just a matter of emphasis. The right word in the right broadcast repeated often enough can destabilise an economy, invent an enemy, change a vote. ",Modern

It's part of you, your brain, your very essence. And when you activated, so did the Firestone. It beamed your full identity directly into your mind. And, at the same time, it absorbed the works of Agatha Christie directly from Lady Eddison. It all became part of you. The mechanics of those novels formed a template in your brain. You've killed, in this pattern, because that's what you think the world is. It turns out, we are in the middle of a murder mystery. One of yours, Dame Agatha. ",Modern

222319," No! Because her face isn't symmetrical. Look!                   Look into the puddle. Your face looks wrong, because                   it looks right. What's the one thing you never see                   when you look at a reflection? Your face. You never                   see your face the right way round. Right. Look for a                   freckle or a funny tooth. Something that's not                   symmetrical.",Modern
228446," No, we'll be dead within one rotation. ",Modern
219790," I can't do that, I'm afraid, Doctor. We can't fight the inevitable. Humanity's day is done. ",Modern
186470," Dave, I want you stay still. Absolutely still.   Dave? Dave? Dave, can you hear me? Are you all right? Talk to me, Dave. ",Modern
237949, Trapezium Seven. That high-gravity circus workshop. Who were the top two in the class? Ready?  ,Modern
209682, What are you? Why do I keep forgetting you? ,Modern
203753," Keep her remembering, keep her focused. That'll hold back the conversion. ",Modern
197355," This is what the Doctor did to me. Abigail was ill when she went into the ice. On the point of death. I suppose the rest in the ice helped her. But she's used up her time. All those Christmas Eves with me. I could release her any time I want, and she would live a single day. So tell me, Ghost of Christmas Present, how do I choose which day?",Modern
238732, I have no idea. ,Modern
194784," Everything. I'm hoping, if we're going down, that barricade won't interfere.   Did you touch something? ",Modern
187856," All right, Donna, have some respect. There's two thousand people in that hospital, and it's vanished. ",Modern
220177, Don't. Shut up.  ,Modern
168862, Shut up. It's better on the streets anyway. It's better food. ,Modern
224471, I never sent for you. ,Modern
196974, Fish. ,Modern
203931, What? ,Modern
224864," Then you'll know that there is a line in the sand, and I'm the man on the other side of it. You want to keep me that way. ",Modern
177498," Hmm. I might use that. Goodnight, Doctor. ",Modern
192481, Exterminate. ,Modern
217695, Something that has the power to raise the dead and turn them into transmitters. I expect we'll know it when we see it.  ,Modern
197471, How did you get this number? This is my private line. How did you get through?,Modern
213589, You go away. Okay? You go a long way away.  ,Modern
173518, Let me have a go. I'm good with computers. Trust me. ,Modern
169467," It's not that. All right, you've got a time travel machine. I believe you. Believe anything, me. But what future? ",Modern
202133, What is happening? ,Modern
219069, Why didn't that Zygon blow us up with her big bazooka? ,Modern
208305, Keep yourself safe. ,Modern
184404," B section mobilised. E section, F section, on my command. ",Modern
231176, Even the wee lassie? ,Modern
188973," Yeah, but I couldn't leave you. ",Modern
200752, You can talk to him.,Modern
166661," I don't know! I didn't plan any of this, did I. It isn't my fault if the dead won't stay dead. ",Modern
238909, I can't hold on to everything... ,Modern
215757," Goodbye, Clara.",Modern
208760," He's me. There's only me here, that's the point. Now let's get back. ",Modern
219470, Could be anything. Meteorite strike. Space pirates.,Modern
222774, The robots want you to be happy but they got the wrong end of the stick. I think we should give them what they want.   Don't even try without smiling. What a lovely place you have here. Thank you so much for your hospitality.  ,Modern
224215, Doctor? ,Modern
200854, Haven't done what? What are you doing? ,Modern
228676," We're here to, er, pitch an invention. Yeah, er, it's a telephone... that plays music, and it's a camera also, takes photo... and it's a calendar.  And it send letters. ",Modern
215422, Who's Missy?,Modern
184290, Still subservient. Good Ood. ,Modern
207297, Where will you go? ,Modern
231334," More like from the heavens. It chose to kill Alfonso when he was a threat, but in other circumstances it fills the bodies and uses them as vessels.  I don't know why. Maybe only when they're dead. ",Modern
215746," Just point and think, yeah?",Modern
239693, Come in!  ,Modern
241183, She's got both. ,Modern
209401," Oh, oh, oh, I'm getting that too! That is brilliant! ",Modern
172661, Then why haven't you taken it? ,Modern
210660,"Fifty first century, right? Time travelling spaceship crashed in the past. You're trying to get home the long way round.",Modern
211059," A lot of people have died. Everything in here is dead, and do you know why that's good?",Modern
213051," That's a good question. It's funny, you only really know what someone thinks of you when you know what lies they've told you. I mean, you say you've seen wonders, you've seen amazing things, and you kept them secret from me. So what do you think of me, Clara?",Modern
213724,"Or you could do that because that works, too.",Modern
173066, The vans were hired out to a company called International Electromatics. But I did a protocol search. Turns out that's a dummy company established by guess who? ,Modern
213564," Not that it's any of my business, but I think you did the right thing.",Modern
190506, Shut the door! Close the door! ,Modern
209541," How those Cyber-evenings must fly.   Hello, the Tardis.",Modern
223214," Definitely not carnivores. Which means you're cooperating with the creature, providing for it. What do you get in return, hmm? What did it take for you to evolve into that? ",Modern
218571, A death is required. It is only way the amulet works. ,Modern
219346," I don't understand? Are you kidding? Me? Of course I understand. I mean, do you call this a war? This funny little thing? This is not a war! I fought in a bigger war than you will ever know. I did worse things than you could ever imagine. And when I close my eyes I hear more screams than anyone could ever be able to count! And do you know what you do with all that pain? Shall I tell you where you put it? You hold it tight till it burns your hand, and you say this. No one else will ever have to live like this. No one else will have to feel this pain. Not on my watch!   Thank you. Thank you.",Modern
188767, Doctor! ,Modern
224805, It's a  five thousand year old pyramid. Just one problem with that. One little problem. It wasn't there yesterday. ,Modern
169967," Look at it, Margaret. ",Modern
178868," Dalek Sec commands, we obey. ",Modern
172582," Go to the carriage, Mother. I will join you there. It is customary, I think, to have an imaginary friend only during one's childhood. You are to be congratulated on your persistence. ",Modern
230370, That'd better be gone by tomorrow. ,Modern
210340," If we are to serve together, I need you in peak physical prowess, eh? ",Modern
228687," This ain't history here, Yaz. We're hiding behind bins. I'm having to work so hard to keep my temper, every second here.  I could've slapped that guy back there as soon as we arrived. Thank God me Nan taught me how to keep my temper. Never give them the excuse. ",Modern
185059, Did he see you? ,Modern
207056," A copy of the oldest plan that we could find. There is no well on the property. None that we could find, anyway. ",Modern
226377," But it's brand new. The colonists haven't arrived yet. We were on our way to pick them up. A skeleton crew, fifty of us, that's all. ",Modern
233847, Yeah. You have been for days now. ,Modern
224466," Apparently, I have. ",Modern
198593, It's okay. The calm won't last forever. When the wind picks up we'll all set sail. ,Modern
171706," Oh, I hate telepathy. Just what I need, a head full of big face. ",Modern
220567, I am checking it properly!  ,Modern
177144," No, but I like that. Good thinking. No, I wish it were that simple. They're making a catalogue. That means they're after something non human, which is very bad news for me. ",Modern
233588, It's hard not to stand out in this gear. ,Modern
240202, And the reward for success?  ,Modern
240858, How would the plan work? ,Modern
207913, Your daughter. You do remember your daughter? Tell us about your daughter. ,Modern
166679, Shut up. ,Modern
226680, So they cured your little condition and kicked you out. ,Modern
178608, They took her. It's my fault. She was following me. ,Modern
167828," Let's have a look, then. ",Modern
170772," I looked into the Tardis, and the Tardis looked into me. ",Modern
184122, Who do you think made your clothes? ,Modern
182774," Come on, you can do it! ",Modern
208262, Please tell me you can fix whatever happened to the children. ,Modern
240045," Do you think we're going to stop, after all the time you've made me wait? This is better than we could ever have hoped. We have everything we need.  Division, the power to destroy your universe, and you. ",Modern
182496, But we're not good enough for that lot. They think we should be in steerage. ,Modern
223440, Other people have money. ,Modern
223124," Morally and practically, that is not a useful distinction. Unlearn it. ",Modern
191929," Well, I just saved the world. The whole planet, for about the millionth time, no charge. Yeah, shoot me. I kept the clothes. ",Modern
203094, What's that? Is that a statue? What is it? It's like a King. ,Modern
229678, Systems malfunction. Currently unavailable. ,Modern
175092, I've ruined it. ,Modern
225889, What? ,Modern
233085, Doc...  ,Modern
228386," Wait. Everyone, stop. Look, it's like the ground's moving. ",Modern
240532, You did not.  ,Modern
198281," Look, will you just get your stupid face out of here. ",Modern
241003," I'm fine, babe.  ",Modern
223072, Don't look at me like that. I'm saying you're a very good con-man. ,Modern
230732," The moment there's a mess or a spill, we get beeped. There's strict time guidelines on how quickly we're supposed to get there and how long it takes us  to clear things up. ",Modern
215606, What.,Modern
223305," The creature in the river, where did it come from? ",Modern
225266, It's safer. ,Modern
192292, Flight two advancing from Biggin Hill. ,Modern
183783, Name yourself. Planet of origin. Galactic coordinates. Species designation according to the universal ratification of the Shadow Proclamation. ,Modern
201572," Perhaps. Maybe, if I shunted the reality compensators on the Tardis, re-calibrated the Doomsday bumpers and jettisoned the karaoke bar, yes. Maybe. Yes. It could do it. The Tardis could sustain the paradox. ",Modern
224041, Try not to breathe so fast. ,Modern
180743, Yes. ,Modern
196596," There is no Amelia. From now on, there never was. History is still collapsing. ",Modern
223155," Oh, what? You don't rob people? ",Modern
223376, The ice is melting! The ice! ,Modern
228044, Shall we just follow her? ,Modern
184199, I can't bear it.   I'm sorry. ,Modern
182365, What about the spheres? ,Modern
169423," So many species, so little time. ",Modern
183091," We've already got one million customers within the Greater London area alone, but from next week, we start rolling out nationwide. The future starts here. And Britain will be thin.",Modern
240098," I became obsessed, as you might imagine. I was able to journey to far-off places, experience tremendous, terrifying vista and creatures.  So I kept records. I marked where one world became another, structured these tunnels around those records. And then, on one journey, I saw... the end of everything. ",Modern
185956," You brought it back from India, did you not? Before you met the Colonel. You came home with malaria, and confined yourself to this house for six months, in a room that has been kept locked ever since, which I rather think means ",Modern
213685, I thought that's what you wanted.,Modern
218681, Welcome back. ,Modern
238177, Yeah. We got away.  ,Modern
169260, Never had a long night? Never had a lot of cabinets to put up? ,Modern
195986," Right. Stop. Crashed ship, let's see. Hello, I'm Captain Troy Handsome of International Rescue. Please state the nature of your emergency. ",Modern
188267," No, but what's that? That's not a planet.",Modern
203970," Ah, yes, well, thank you, Arthur CClarke. Teleport, obviously. I mean, we're on a spaceship with dinosaurs. Why wouldn't there be a teleport? In fact, why don't we just teleport now? ",Modern
238157," Him. Very much him. It's like his ship's covered in it. That shouldn't be happening. We're pushing through it to land. Nothing's as it should be, Yaz.  Too much out of the ordinary tonight. ",Modern
217461," I want another adventure. Come on, you feel the same. You're itching to save a planet, I know it. ",Modern
207915, Is that why you experimented on her? ,Modern
176071, The sphere broke down the barriers between worlds. We only followed. Its origin is unknown. ,Modern
224453," It's, er, I think it's pretty serious. ",Modern
198308," Er, Doctor. Canton here tells me you're, you're from the future. It hardly seems possible, but I was wondering ",Modern
200017," Nurse! Nurse! Damn it, where's the nurse!",Modern
166382," I am the last pure human. The others mingled.   Oh, they call themselves New humans and Proto-humans and Digi-humans, even 'Humanish, but you know what I call them? Mongrels. ",Modern
211581,"Your words are strange, fair one.",Modern
211958, Do you know what's under there?,Modern
197320, Yeah. ,Modern
211567," No, no, chop-chop, come on. ",Modern
234236, Nothing. Keep moving. ,Modern
217164, I gave it up. Bad memories.,Modern
171759, We will take the house. ,Modern
238605, Hi. I'm Yaz. ,Modern
170398," Whatever it is, you can wait. ",Modern
225824," Oh my God, it even does lip-sync. ",Modern
179644, What's wrong with him? ,Modern
231149, Thirty six now.  ,Modern
212151, You didn't look like you believed him.,Modern
178892, I'll go and keep an eye out. Make sure we're safe up here. Don't want nobody butting in. ,Modern
213068, Not a soldier.,Modern
175684," Go on, give us a clue. Which events do we do well in? ",Modern
233703, This isn't the first time? ,Modern
166937," But in your time, he was already dead. We've brought him back to life, and he's more alive now than he's ever been, old Charlie boy. Let's give him one last surprise.",Modern
172351," I don't feel threatened by you, if that's what you mean. ",Modern
175915, Oh yes. But we'll make you perfectly comfortable. And there is so much you can teach us. Starting with this.,Modern
221662, It sounds like ,Modern
198317, I figured it might be.,Modern
185613, Yeah. And you'd think it'd get easier. All those things you've been ready to die for. I thought for a moment there you'd finally found something worth living for. ,Modern
234015, I'm losing visuals across the compound. I don't know how many of those creatures have got in. ,Modern
209643, What is this place? ,Modern
221559, What is it? ,Modern
206904, Not at all. ,Modern
223635," Can I have a word, please? ",Modern
183326, What about Rose? ,Modern
199942," You're going to have to start explaining some of this to me, Doctor. ",Modern
201950," It needs to convert the faith into a form it can consume. Faith is an energy, the specific emotional energy the creature needs to live. Which is why at the end of her note, Lucy said ",Modern
192738, Because someone on a spaceship twelve thousand years ago is trying to attract my attention. Let's see if we can get the security playback working. ,Modern
179521, Hmm. Especially about playing loud. ,Modern
227791," Enough questions! You lot, you love to chat. I get it. Lots to do. I'm working on it all. And I haven't forgotten about your collarbones, Graham.  Give me nine minutes, a bit of quiet, and I'll be ready to roll. Scout's honour. ",Modern
175788, It's not worth it for a snog. ,Modern
211224, Good luck.,Modern
169876, You won't change my mind. ,Modern
212808," Tobias, you can do whatever you want.   ",Modern
224360," Thank you, Doctor, for all that you've done. I'm sorry that I didn't have more faith in your methods. ",Modern
214859, No. You're not experimenting on   ,Modern
204638, We have two lives. Real life and Doctor life. Except real life doesn't get much of a look in. ,Modern
208371," You ever wanted to be Emperor, Gloria? ",Modern
179558, It went dead four minutes ago. ,Modern
207814, Thank you. What is your name? ,Modern
240010, They've all changed!  ,Modern
171368, Face! Face! Face!,Modern
178742," Oh, my God. ",Modern
229158, Oh. How very moving. ,Modern
239064," Mission accomplished, boss.",Modern
201688, I'll leave you two alone. ,Modern
220595, Screen on.  ,Modern
179788, The parasite's too aggressive. Your husband's gone. There's no way back. I'm sorry.  Mc ,Modern
218752, And the key to perfect negotiation? ,Modern
169412, What do you mmmmm. Mummy.,Modern
185932, How silly. What proof do you have? ,Modern
215950, How much? ,Modern
194652, You said we're supposed to be defending ourselves. ,Modern
205453," You have, if I may say, a remarkable amount of wisdom in these matters, for one so very pretty, Miss Montague. Young, I mean. ",Modern
186612, Doctor! ,Modern
239215, Claire Brown.,Modern
225842," Well, there they are. The Ninth Legion. Great big pile of bodies. It's not always fun to be right.  This wasn't long ago. Whatever did it is close by. We need to find Bill. ",Modern
231291, Why? ,Modern
219320, So's everyone. ,Modern
236575, What are you doing? ,Modern
189972," No, it's dormant because it's so cold down there, but your body heat is raising the temperature. ",Modern
172794, What's in a name? Names are just titles. Titles don't tell you anything. ,Modern
235056, Presenting occupant of housing unit. ,Modern
195010," The moment we get down there, everything will fall apart. ",Modern
198830," Not any more, but there have been many Tardises on my back in days gone by. ",Modern
188052, Yeah.,Modern
197265, No. ,Modern
186965, Don't bother the man. Where's my water bottle? ,Modern
209664, That altar looks like a bed. ,Modern
187446," All right, I'm interested. Yes, I can't help it. Because whatever's inside her, it's brand new, and that's fascinating. ",Modern
178827," That Mister Diagoras, he was like some sort of fixer, yeah? Get you jobs all over town? ",Modern
238791," Not while I'm around. Now, hit the road, Skaak. ",Modern
223595, I probably will. ,Modern
215742, Give me the screwdriver.,Modern
180475," I wouldn't be so pleased, Son of Mine. These bodies are silly and hot. They can damage and die. That's why we need the Time Lord. ",Modern
175064," And if you get your way, might there be more little kisses between the two of you? ",Modern
196021, It's good enough for me. Geronimo! Argh! ,Modern
188972," Mum, I told you not to. ",Modern
199234," Doctor, look. ",Modern
211568, Seriously.,Modern
187093, It must be the metal. We're cooling down. It's just settling. ,Modern
231457," It was spoiling my view of the hill.    But something lay beneath it. I awoke Hell. Satan himself attacked me, poisoned me. That night I felt it growing inside me. The mark of Satan.  I fought it. I took medicine, I prayed, but it grew. I did God's work in the hope that He would save me. ",Modern
181181, Cardiff. ,Modern
203994," Then learn. Any man who speaks to me that way, I execute. ",Modern
200154, Doctor. ,Modern
228307, Okay. Now that was impressive. ,Modern
208505, Ow! ,Modern
234122, Solar blistering? What a lovely phrase. Here's another one. Completely knackered vehicle. We're stranded. ,Modern
176125, Daleks do not take orders. ,Modern
210818, Why does a hospital need a doctor?,Modern
214610," Shush, shush!    Hang on. There's a knack to this.  ",Modern
240611, Time loop. ,Modern
237292, One. Emergencies only. ,Modern
192398," You're resisting, Winston. The whole world knows you're resisting. You're a beacon of hope. ",Modern
229512," Mabli, stop beating yourself up. I'm sure there's a simple explanation.   It's all right, you're safe. Just don't make any sudden moves. Your body'll take a moment to catch up. ",Modern
199346, It hurt so much. ,Modern
217952," The Fisher King had been dead for a hundred and fifty years before we even got here. But once I went back, I became part of events. But here's the thing. The messages my ghost gave, they weren't for you, they were for me. That list. Everyone after you was random, but you being the next name, that's what made me confront the Fisher King.",Modern
225153," Ah, you're going to have to guide me. ",Modern
208610, No. ,Modern
175632, She's my baby! You're not going to hurt her again! ,Modern
215573, Remember all those years when all you wanted to do was to rule the world? On my way.,Modern
177930," You're too late for that. We've passed the lay-by. You're a passenger now, Sonny Jim. ",Modern
221643," No, no, please, no! Let me out of here! What's happening?What  are you doing? ",Modern
197375, I'm sorry. I didn't realise. ,Modern
232379," Please, please, please. No backup plan.   I'm sorry, Delph. ",Modern
239677," Get her out of here, now!  ",Modern
198856," Rory, look after her. ",Modern
191161, Anything?,Modern
188304, I'm receiving a communication from the earthbound ships. They have a message for the human race. ,Modern
229958, Yes. ,Modern
231568, I've always fancied the idea of Norway. What bit's this? ,Modern
239407, Why risky?,Modern
223161, Spider is. He... ,Modern
190720," Oh, my gosh, Doctor. You're a sight for sore eyes. ",Modern
213381, There are the other three.   ,Modern
194972, Ambrose. ,Modern
190703, Oh? ,Modern
171535," Mmm, aren't you just.   Terminal's this way. Phew. ",Modern
168660," No, I did have. ",Modern
195399," Oh right, yes, that. Don't worry. I'll be back before you can say where's he got to now? Not that fast! But pretty fast. See you around.",Modern
224704, You are not real. There is nothing you can do. ,Modern
223472, If I need to. Done?  ,Modern
172526, Reinette. ,Modern
210620, They never sent you in here without a word.,Modern
222192," Poetry, physics, same thing.",Modern
207807, It's complicated. ,Modern
214921," It's there on the screen, look. Big solar flare headed this way. A thousand kilometres a second. Coronal mass ejection. Geomagnetic storm. It's huge. It's brewing up a solar wind big enough to blow this whole planet away.  I assumed your teachers have mentioned this?",Modern
213374, Decision made.  ,Modern
190471," The final option. The nuclear device at the heart of the Central Dome. Today, on the twenty first of November 2059, Captain Brooke activates that device, taking the base and all her crew members with her. No one ever knows why. But you were saving Earth. That's what inspires your granddaughter. She takes your people out into the galaxy because you die on Mars. You die today. She flies out there like she's trying to meet you. ",Modern
216375, Is anyone else asking that? ,Modern
203968, We're outside. We're on a beach. ,Modern
235816, Maryam. Maryam. ,Modern
176483, I can't think of what to say! ,Modern
205673," No, I do the hand grabbing. That's my job. That's always me! ",Modern
189063," Can't get rid of him. Jack, what's her name? ",Modern
224433," Oh, you're a girl! ",Modern
228067, Sorry about the mess. ,Modern
225142, I don't even know your name. ,Modern
167453," Never mind the signal, get out! Mum, ",Modern
235136, I don't know why I'm even trusting you. ,Modern
241063, He was my father. ,Modern
226324," Yeah, I think she was a man back then. I'm fairly sure that I was, too. It was a long time ago, though. ",Modern
234933, Five minutes. ,Modern
189041, Heads up! ,Modern
224680," But this is, this   This is real. I feel it. ",Modern
234758, Let's see what this thing can do. Stay out of our lab!   Oh. ,Modern
219876, My God. A whole London street just up and disappeared and you lot assume it's a copyright infringement.  ,Modern
189969, One of the creatures. ,Modern
219539, Clara!,Modern
239017," Oh, sorry. I'm split across multiple events, multiple Time streams. I can't be constant. Multiple crises and I'm still trying to work out  the plan. You're camouflaged here, because this is where you belong. The best place to hide you all is in your own lives. ",Modern
234982," A few cash-flow problems, a collection of old phones and keys. ",Modern
232108," Doc, can I have a word? ",Modern
194884, Door at the end. ,Modern
221445," Merry Christmas, Nardole! ",Modern

187605, I wouldn't touch her. ,Modern
224358, Better? ,Modern
230771, Have you tried working down there? There's no time to add stuff to slips. This was done somewhere else before it gets to Fulfilment. ,Modern
238115, I have no idea.  ,Modern
176212, They need you. ,Modern
195539, And this one? ,Modern
197964, There's nothing behind me. ,Modern
203989, Do you hear that? Did you hear what he called him? Doctor. After all this time. Bring them to me. ,Modern
227213, From the far future. ,Modern
234819," Er, it needs work. ",Modern
176166, Quarantine the Sphere chamber. Start emergency upgrading. Begin with these personnel. ,Modern
238506, Cannon ball in the back. ,Modern
221949," A bit empty, isn't  it?",Modern
232163," Why, cos you know I'm right? ",Modern
211362,Doctor! My choice. Robin Hood. Show me.,Modern
176127, Outline resembles the inferior species known as Cybermen. ,Modern
194051," It's Upper Leadworth, actually. We've gone slightly upmarket. ",Modern
229941, Rough. But it'll work. ,Modern
203765," Two thousand years, waiting for you outside a box. Don't say it isn't true, you know it's true. Give me your arm. Amy! ",Modern
226201, Finally! ,Modern
190025, It is gold. ,Modern
190906," Miss Addams, we're getting encouraging results from the ratio-foldback. Can you confirm? ",Modern

231997," Come on, Graham.   It is a very nice fjord.",Modern
233855, Mmm.  ,Modern
203884, Doctor who? ,Modern
229064, We'll look after your friends. I'm going to make pakora. ,Modern
227356," Trouble is, I thought I'd been rescued. It felt rather like a miracle, in fact. But I do have this feeling they're going to put me back.  Back in that crater in time to die. And you see, I'm not ready any more. I've lost the idea of it. That's the trouble with hope.  Makes one awfully frightened.   I must sound like the most dreadful coward. ",Modern
232701," These are my serious tech skillz. And yes, that is with a Z. Bio-tracking fused to holo-projection. Won't last long, but I need you to see just how  serious my face is right now. But it's not just you I want to talk to.   Lin, I know you can hear me. I need you to know we're coming for you, so keep fighting. Mitch is here with us. ",Modern
198145," She can always hear me, Doctor. Always. Wherever she is, and she always knows that I am coming for her. Do you understand me? Always. ",Modern
227078, What do you know of regeneration? Are you a Time Lord? ,Modern
213801," Not that kind of. Look, we, er, we knocked about together, we travelled and now we're stopping. This is a, I don't know, goodbye to the good times?",Modern
229183, Where's that?,Modern
228544, No.   Force shields.,Modern
191848," Okay, guys, let's do this. ",Modern
225001, This is impossible. We can't search a whole planet in a few minutes. ,Modern
179280, Don't know. Let's try back at the reception.   Is that Lady Thaw? ,Modern
225843, Don't move! Stay where you are!,Modern
212295, Out.,Modern
197276," Three, two, one, pull! ",Modern
193375," If it was a real screen, what would we do? We'd pull the plug. We'd kill the power. But we can't just knock her out, the Angel would just take over. ",Modern
169338," What, are you telling me you do dance? ",Modern
170290," There you go, patch that in. It's programmed to find her. ",Modern
234308, She didn't make it back. ,Modern
210995," No, neither can I.",Modern
224660," What? Sorry, you're not making any sense. When did we end up in a computer game? When did that start? ",Modern
226419, I'm really sorry. ,Modern
169330," You don't think he's coming back, do you? ",Modern
222591," And Relative Dimension In Space.  It means, what the hell?",Modern
187047," Joe, you said we took a detour? ",Modern
239994, She thinks running will help. ,Modern
182235, All that human invention that had sustained them across the eons. It all turned inwards. They cannibalised themselves. ,Modern
232059, Engine's fine.    The power's still working. The ship's fine. He could've left whenever he wanted. It doesn't make sense. ,Modern
215178,"   Clara, is it over now?",Modern
171797," Does it? Yes, it does. Good. Good. Then let me ask - why is Your Majesty travelling by road when there's a train all the way to Aberdeen? ",Modern
192156," No. Never forgot, never voted, not technically a British subject. ",Modern
222176, Yeah. ,Modern
211266," Show me a star, Rusty.",Modern
228344," Well, if you leave now, you could get there before Sleeping Beauty. You could win.   What was that? ",Modern
234592," Exactly. You don't have to hurt her. With your levels of technology, you must understand there is no need for violence. ",Modern
206983, What did you do? ,Modern
168179," Come on. This is it. Come on. Oh God, make it me. Come on, say my name, say my name, say my name. ",Modern
220777," No, wait. That's your husband? ",Modern
170151, And don't start that again either. ,Modern
224102, Yeah. We're from the mythical union. ,Modern
221796, And? ,Modern
192246, The last of its kind. ,Modern
224779, Stay where you are! Clear. ,Modern
197456," Are you, are you okay? ",Modern
173741, And that's a woman's job? ,Modern
179751, I only take orders form one person round here. ,Modern
176674, Yeah. I'm not from Mars. ,Modern
207873, How? ,Modern
190470, Detonation. ,Modern
203722, That's all he is. ,Modern
196926, What? What do you want? ,Modern
239417, But why are they attacking my house? What do they want?,Modern
181448," It's the sound of drums. More and more, as though it's getting closer. ",Modern
223396, Get a load of you lot! Cute as! Come in. ,Modern
214754," Oh, like you listened to her?  ",Modern
211810," Well, I'm leaving him a present, aren't I?",Modern
214986, Stay shut up.,Modern
236076, What was that? ,Modern
211232," Well, Rusty, here we are. Eye to eye.",Modern
209471," Well, there's some debate. Either No More or Gallifrey Falls. ",Modern
178973, Nope. ,Modern
224857," Nothing yet, all looks fine. ",Modern
166774, I can't! ,Modern
170992, Mister Llewellyn. ,Modern
196597, But how can I still be here if she's not? ,Modern
174441, My Legions shall swarm across the worlds.,Modern
213107," End of the world for me tonight, whatever you do. Parents' evening.",Modern
236288, She is the most baffling creature I've ever been acquainted with. ,Modern
167164, I did miss you. ,Modern
167235, Not now. We're busy. Can't you go home? ,Modern
193405," You'd slow us down, Miss Pond. ",Modern
166993, Nope. ,Modern
222557," Bill, let go! You have to let go! She is not                   human any more.",Modern
203327, Tell us! ,Modern
221501, I was setting a trap. ,Modern
201819," Every time the Doctor gets pally with someone, I have this overwhelming urge to notify their next of kin.   Ooo. Sorry. The last time I said something like that, you hit me with your shoe. And you literally had to sit down and unlace it first. ",Modern
207785," The name, Sweetville. ",Modern
221471, I look them up sometimes. ,Modern
210596, You don't have a choice. I tell you what. I'll answer your questions if you answer mine.,Modern
222193, How is it the same?,Modern
183754," Yeah, not so much. ",Modern
238541, A conjuring trick? ,Modern
181409, Chan it's working tho! ,Modern
220165, Do what?  ,Modern
228314, What just happened? ,Modern
199797, Who are the real monsters? ,Modern
202263, The Cybermen are here? But you said ,Modern
190503, Steffi! ,Modern
238404, Follow. Follow. This was not foreseen. Priest Triangles are only guardians. We maintain and serve. The impact of the Flux event was too great.,Modern
236227, What? ,Modern
232442, Or he could be nothing to do with it whatsoever. ,Modern
197574," You got 3, I was 2, Mister Delaware was 4. ",Modern
181712, You going to tell us who he is? ,Modern
237224, We're never going to find her in this lot. ,Modern
221000," Well, yes. ",Modern
219622, You have to do the song.,Modern
193145," There's no way up, no way back, no way out. No pressure, but this is usually when you have a really good idea. ",Modern
225984, I have to stop it. This is my fault. I'm the Keeper of the Gate. I have to put this right. ,Modern
205993, Okay. ,Modern
172201," All right, team. Oh, I hate people who say team. Er, gang. Er, comrades. Anyway, Rose, go to the kitchen. Get a sample of that oil. Mickey, the new staff are all Maths teachers. Go and check out the Maths department. I'm going to look in Finch's office. Be back here in ten minutes. ",Modern
214728," Oh, yes, I am. Very clever. But what use is clever against trees? They don't listen to reason. You can't plead with them. You can't lie to them. They have no moving parts, no circuits. This is a natural event. ",Modern
225666," Set a date, have you, son? You and your Alice? ",Modern
232792," Yes, I am. You want this planet, you have to come through me. So why don't you make it easy on yourself and leave now?",Modern
187286," I don't think so, no. I think the more we talk, the more she learns. Now, I'm all for education, but in this case, maybe not. Let's just move back. Come on. Come with me. Everyone, get back. All of you, as far as you can. ",Modern
223034,"  Come to the Frost Fair, miss. Only a sixpence, miss. ",Modern
184251, But it's got to be connected to the red eye. What is it? ,Modern
231933, Is it me or is this woman completely mad?  ,Modern
190073," Doctor, it's coming for us. ",Modern
201079, It's not possible. This isn't ,Modern
181392," Hermits United. We meet up every ten years and swap stories about caves. It's good fun, for a hermit. So, er, Utopia? ",Modern
210113," So it's him, then, the Doctor?",Modern
185017," Why? They don't need it. Why attack now? What are they up to? Times like this, I could do with the Brigadier. No offence. ",Modern
176107, Scans detect unknown technology active within Sphere chamber. ,Modern
234597, They took them. ,Modern
236515," And when it thought it might be discovered, it manipulated all of our perceptions. ",Modern
217416,"When you were in the Dalek, you made it say mercy.. It shouldn't have understood the concept, it shouldn't have been able to say it. How did a tiny piece of mercy get into the DNA of the Daleks?  ",Modern
210684," I don't think of it. I don't. Droids and apostrophes, I could write a book. Except you are barely a droid any more. There's more human in you than machine. So tell me, what do you think of the view?",Modern
224409," Obviously, this sect, they understood the language. ",Modern
184720," An ordinary death for such a remarkable enemy, but proceed. ",Modern
240926, You two. Come on. Out of time. ,Modern
208685," Die, reptile. ",Modern
208562, Your what? ,Modern
228701," Well, your Nan, when she found out I was a bus driver, said to me, you'd better not be like James Blake. Blake the snake, that's what she called him.  And I had to ask her who he was and she just said he gave all bus drivers a bad name. ",Modern

192215, Yeah? It's an antique. So? ,Modern
230181, We can't go. I came here for answers. All I've got is more questions. ,Modern
218658, Oooooo! ,Modern
222164, Bill Potts.,Modern
232669," You can't just leave him outside, can you?",Modern
211798, Hmm. Good. History is a burden. Stories can make us fly.,Modern
173917," I want my friend restored, and I think that's beyond a little backstreet electrician, so tell me, who's really in charge here? ",Modern
232851," What, on New Year's Day, when everything's shut and everyone's hung over?",Modern
203164, Open it! ,Modern
233015, Your car just assassinated its driver and then attempted to kill us. ,Modern
189653," I knew it, man. I said so. ",Modern
178292," I wonder what year it is, because look, the Empire State Building's not even finished yet. ",Modern

215796, Excuse me?,Modern
234116," Er, er, we both have dead parents? ",Modern
232371," Yeah, but just the foot. Just it. Just in the foot. Just to shut him up. Don't tell the Doc, she'll be livid. ",Modern

190643, That man is dead. ,Modern
239800," Lethbridge Stewart here. I want a call to the RAF, please.  ",Modern
225031, How many have reached stage two? You cannot accept their offer. ,Modern
219290," Oh, I was really hoping that it wouldn't. ",Modern
226808, Less to throw away. ,Modern
232075, And why would I do that? ,Modern

212675," Of course I'm kidding. It's a time machine, not a miracle worker. Bye, bye.",Modern
171217," Allow? You've no choice. I mean, that's all blood control is. A cheap bit of voodoo. Scares the pants off you, but that's as far as it goes. It's like hypnosis. You can hypnotise someone to walk like a chicken or sing like Elvis. You can't hypnotise them to death. Survival instinct's too strong. ",Modern
217095," Hello.  Oh, poppet. Do you really think you could?",Modern
220641, But ,Modern
201538," Oh, so you didn't call it the Doctor, or Biggles ",Modern

218367, And you just left me there? ,Modern
239173," No, she's our toy now. ",Modern
180087, Exactly. Good old London town. ,Modern
224789," I don't know the President. How would I know the President? I mean, I wouldn't even have voted for him. He's orange. ",Modern

Right old misery? Life and soul? Right handed? Left handed? A gambler? A fighter? A coward? A traitor? A liar? A nervous wreck? I mean, judging by the evidence, I've certainly got a gob. And how am I going to react when I see this, a great big threatening button. A great big threatening button which must not be pressed under any circumstances, am I right? Let me guess. It's some sort of control matrix, hmm? Hold on, what's feeding it?   And what've we got here? Blood? Yeah, definitely blood. Human blood. APositive, with just a dash of iron. Ah, but that means blood control. Blood control! Oh, I haven't seen blood control for years. You're controlling all the APositives. Which leaves us with a great big stinking problem. Because I really don't know who I am. I don't know when to stop. So if I see a great big threatening button which should never, ever, ever be pressed, then I just want to do this. ",Modern

We tell Mum to get there for about eight thirty, nine, and that gives me time to have a word with Annalise, and   What? ",Modern
212715," Hmm. It means that you are a very clever man making the mistake, common to very clever people, of assuming that everybody else is stupid. Where are you going?",Modern
213667," Well, we've got doctors and professors coming out of our ears on this trip. So, what are you a doctor of?",Modern
212687, Of course we won't starve. The sand piranhas will get us long before that.,Modern

201871, Anything to do with you? How's it going? ,Modern
195569," I wouldn't say that. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. Hey. The good things don't always soften the bad things, but vice versa, the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things or make them unimportant. And we definitely added to his pile of good things. And, if you look carefully, maybe we did indeed make a couple of little changes. ",Modern
225617, Thank you. ,Modern
235019, Diversion. ,Modern

212050," Yeah, it's better than Pink.",Modern
217902, I've come from the future. I've seen the chaos you cause. The bloodshed.,Modern

227150, Hang on. ,Modern

209496, How did you know? ,Modern
215743, No. ,Modern
241225," I'm going to keep him talking till he reveals himself. He's got quite an ego. Much more of a zealot than the ones I've met before in the future.  I'm going to find out what he's up to, and then I'll dazzle you with a beautiful bit of improvisation. ",Modern
189339, But where are they going? ,Modern

214579," I find everything confusing, nearly. So, I don't say anything. That's how come I'm in the woods. I thought Miss Oswald told me to find the Doctor. But it wasn't her. It was just in my head. ",Modern

199521," Wait, wait, just wait. ",Modern
241135, Ji-Hun's in league with the Sea Devils. Why would he do that? ,Modern

191887, Doctor. ,Modern
181776, No. ,Modern
215133," Oh, look at that. You can see my house from here. Yeah, sorry, probably not helping.",Modern
211113, Radiation levels increasing.,Modern
176183," Yeah, I am. Mind you, I quite like hope. Hope's a good emotion. And here it comes. ",Modern
236441, Are you the Guardian? ,Modern
219044," The invasion has happened. You're probably surrounded by Zygons. Get to the Tardis, get yourself safe. Apparently my plane is never going to land. Let's see what we can do about that!",Modern
171597, I'm afraid not. ,Modern
195322, Absolutely. One of my favourites. ,Modern
221858, Of course I eat dinner. ,Modern
184947," Well then, shoot me. ",Modern
235087," Listen, kid, working with some low-rent equipment here. ",Modern
238355, This better work.  ,Modern
185210," Oh, same old stuff. They're fine. So, you going to come with us? We're not exactly short of space. ",Modern
195727, Yes? Hello?,Modern
211373," I'm many things, sir, but I'm never that. Robin Hood laughs in the face of all. Ha, ha, ha.",Modern
234029," If I had to guess, the Doctor.",Modern
223028," Yeah, so was Pete. ",Modern
191377," Okay, right then, I will. Because you had to go in there, didn't you? You had to go and get stuck, oh yes. Because that's who you are, Wilfred. You were always this. Waiting for me all this time. ",Modern
171265," Is it him, though? Is it really the Doctor? Oh, my God, it's the bleeding Prime Minister! ",Modern
203706," Do you know how you make someone into a Dalek? Subtract love, add anger. Doesn't she seem a bit too angry to you? ",Modern
240079, She feels all of it.  ,Modern
236762, Mum! ,Modern
184425," Yesterday, fifty two people died in identical circumstances, right across the world, in eleven different time zones. Five a.m. in the UK, six a.m. in France, eight a.m. in Moscow, one p.m. in China. ",Modern
235177," Oh yeah, nothing screams smart like a laser rifle. ",Modern
213830, What? Where are you?,Modern
201103, Where are we? ,Modern
238817, What was in that tube? ,Modern
210715, Whose authority?,Modern

240489, Very good. Here's the keys. ,Modern
191973," Do I look like people?  AMY; Yes.   Been knocking around on my own for a while. My choice, but I've started talking to myself all the time. It's giving me earache. ",Modern
179985, You've got to give back what they took. ,Modern
173183," Missis Tyler, is there anything I can get you? ",Modern
176750, Do you think Mister Clements knows about this place? ,Modern
184626," Good afternoon, sir. ",Modern
231065, Opening delivery. Activating bubble wrap.  ,Modern
176121, You will identify first. ,Modern
183838, It's the heart of Vesuvius. We're right inside the mountain. ,Modern
195150," I love you, Dad. ",Modern
207009, And you are? ,Modern
191891, I'm not. Poor Amy Pond. Still such a child inside. Dreaming of the magic Doctor she knows will return to save her. What a disappointment you've been. ,Modern
200689, It's okay. Stay still and don't move.   Privileges activated. See? Activated. ,Modern
197927," He's my friend, if friend is the right word. I haven't seen him in a while. I had something I wanted to tell him, but stuff always gets in the way. ",Modern
224949," Do I? Oh, I'm sorry. It's not my first dead planet. ",Modern
189688," Yes, ma'am. ",Modern
216919, You will come. You will stay.,Modern
193721, Oh yeah. I'll explain later. ,Modern
185732," Well the last thing we want is PCPlod sticking his nose in, especially now I've found this. Morphic residue. ",Modern
171386, Override controls.,Modern
197006, I just want to see them. ,Modern
231564," Ah, nice fjord. That is a fjord, innit? Got your bearings yet, Doc? ",Modern
173260," Everybody, in! ",Modern
238130," You've got to go home now, Claire. ",Modern
181750," But I've got plenty of research on you. Yes, good family, Roedean, not especially bright but essentially harmless. And that's why I'm asking you, Lucy. I am begging you. If you have seen anything, heard anything, even the slightest thing that would give you cause to doubt him? ",Modern
202730," Oh, you love me, do you? Oh, that's sweet of you. Isn't that sweet. Come here, you. ",Modern
206944, How did it do that? ,Modern
173106, We could have been anyone. ,Modern
190390, I'm sorry. ,Modern
222784, There's a giant smiley abattoir over there and I'm having this really childish impulse to blow it up. Be right back.  ,Modern
204385, Guys! ,Modern
213618," Oh! Is there a doctor? Sorry, I need a doctor. Sorry, I don't know. She just, she just stopped.",Modern
191339, We're getting out of here. This whole planet's going to be knocked out of orbit. ,Modern
217616, Shut up. It was nothing  You really think so?  ,Modern
227613, Was it an alien? Because it looked like an alien to me. ,Modern
240607," We've been here before, but Time reset, so we're still alive. You failed. ",Modern
173461, You are Peter Tyler. Confirm you are Peter Tyler. ,Modern

179055, Exterminate! ,Modern
217982, Doctor! Doctor! ,Modern
189082, I regret I will need remote access to Tardis base code numerals. ,Modern
187912," Merry Christmas, sir! ",Modern
192816, We have a minute. Shall we?   Where are we up to? Have we done the Bone Meadows? ,Modern
188399," Show respect. Without Dalek Caan, none of this would be possible. And he speaks only the truth. ",Modern
207557," You can't, can you. You're a coward. You won't save him, but you're scared to tell him why. ",Modern
218641," Sorry, yes. Sorry about the horse! Excuse me! ",Modern
207563, What? ,Modern
199272," You're not a monastery, you're a factory. Twenty second century army-owned factory. ",Modern
172193," Er, so, er, have you worked here long? ",Modern
240694," I mean... four floors up, I mean, there's a mad stash of stuff four floors up. ",Modern
179978, Impact in four forty seven.,Modern
224980, Maybe they're like vampires. Can't come in unless they're invited. ,Modern
208975," As you instructed, nothing has been touched. ",Modern
174561, What do we do? Jefferson? ,Modern
226014, It poisons the light as the beast eats it. ,Modern
187479, That's not what I meant. ,Modern
221591, What's wrong with me? ,Modern
178713, Find the Doctor. The prisoners must be recaptured.,Modern
236356," Of course not. You two just need a spray tan and a kip, eh? ",Modern
236216, Breaking and entering's worse. ,Modern
192159, Your family? ,Modern
216829," Great, thanks. Change the algorithm. Eliminate the crisis points. Where is the Doctor making the most noise, but there isn't any crisis? ",Modern
196749," Good luck, everyone. Behave. Do not let that girl open her eyes. Amy, later. River, going to need your computer. ",Modern
176666," And he nagged, and he nagged me ",Modern
233089," Doctor, something's trying to get in! ",Modern
180938," Okay. There's this house. A big old house, been empty for years, falling apart. Wester Drumlins, out by the estate. You've probably seen it. ",Modern
178792, So what about us? What do we do now? ,Modern
188099, Just stand here. ,Modern
191853, Look in the mirror. Ha ha! Uniform. Are you on your way? You're going to need a car. ,Modern
209398, What? What don't they know? ,Modern
218769, Every race is peaceful and warlike. ,Modern
179047," No, I beg you, don't. ",Modern
192855," What's that mean, it's a statue when you see it? ",Modern
228046, All systems offline! We're not going to make it!  ,Modern
171813, Like a stamp. ,Modern
213094, Out. Now.,Modern
201500," That's, that's good, isn't it? ",Modern
235669, Stop faffing about. ,Modern
194169," I have chosen. Of course I've chosen.   It's you, stupid. ",Modern
168280," No, but I couldn't have it done, I mean, that's got to hurt, hasn't it? ",Modern
228689," Yeah, see? It's not like Rosa Parks wipes out racism from the world forever. Otherwise, how come I get stopped way more by the police than my white mates? ",Modern
204180, Where are they now? ,Modern
226869, How was that possible? ,Modern
179572," Seven, including us. ",Modern
240916, Right.  ,Modern
181011," Have you noticed what all seventeen DVDs have in common yet? I suppose it's hard for you, in a way. ",Modern
169097," Please, mummy. Please let me in. I'm scared of the bombs, mummy. Please, mummy.   Mummy. Mummy. ",Modern
237867, I was deliberately acting as a decoy.,Modern
239611, What target?,Modern
208210, We're a punishment platoon. We can't beat a Cyberman. The Imperium has to know what's happening. ,Modern
174339, Capsule established. All systems functioning. The mineshaft is go. Bring systems online now. ,Modern
179367, That's not your decision to make.,Modern
215191," Maybe just a tad, yeah.",Modern
221757, I'm in hell. Naked hell. I just can't look at people. ,Modern
227491," Oh, brilliant!  To Be Continued...",Modern
178611, Why? Why were you there? ,Modern
168535," Oh, my God. She's going to be at the wedding. ",Modern
182794," Yeah, right, fine. One problem at a time. What's on deck thirty one?",Modern
173933," And you let her do it, Magpie. ",Modern
237804, What do you mean? ,Modern
229889," Why are you on this ship, General? ",Modern
222942," Oh, no, no, no, no, no! Don't cry, don't cry! Hey, hey. Look, everything's going to be okay. Look, this is your new house. Isn't it lovely? ",Modern
192057, Below. ,Modern
231752, That is one vicious moth. ,Modern
211628,"Ah. Good, yes, I was hoping we'd get round to that.",Modern
183405, A mate. I want a mate. ,Modern
228612," Well, it could be worth a lot. ",Modern
204380," Sir, might I enquire who you is? ",Modern
168067," We'd better get out. Van Statten's disappeared. They're closing down the base. Goddard says they're going to fill it full of cement, like it never existed. ",Modern
198333, So. ,Modern
236786, Do we? And how's that working for us? ,Modern
218036, Do not believe this foolish trickery!   It's supposed to do that.  ,Modern
191235," Now the star is mine. I can increase the signal and use it as a lifeline. Do you get it now? Do you see? Keep watching, Doctor. This should be spectacular. ",Modern
210996," We'll be following you all the way, Rescue One. Good luck all of you. ",Modern
180930," Okay, that's enough. I've had enough now. I've had a long day and I've had bloody enough! Sorry. Bad day. ",Modern
213410, Doctor!   ,Modern
225936, Enough. ,Modern
224506, The very centre of the Haereticum. Home of the Veritas for over a thousand years. ,Modern
199863," I've had it with this. What's the point in this ridiculous war? Look at you, Jen. You were a sweet kid. Look at you now. The stuff of nightmares. I don't want my world populated by monsters. ",Modern
199328," Yeah! I mean, thanks. I'll try. ",Modern
179859, He was about to kill you.  Mc ,Modern
195128, Only those foolish enough to follow Restac. ,Modern
190627," Ah! Now, sorry. There you are. So, where were we? I was summoned, wasn't I? An Ood in the snow, calling to me. Well, I didn't exactly come straight here. Had a bit of fun, you know. Travelled about, did this and that. Got into trouble. You know me. It was brilliant. I saw the Phosphorous Carousel of the Great Magellan Gestadt, saved a planet from the Red Carnivorous Maw, named a galaxy Alison. Got married. That was a mistake. Good Queen Bess. And let me tell you, her nickname is no longer. Ahem. Anyway, what do you want? ",Modern
175040," Well, you do that, and I'll make us a cup of tea. Go on, go and sit down. Put the telly on if you want. Can't bear it silent.   It's just me these days, rattling about. There's my daughter, she's gone travelling. I keep her bedroom all nice and ready though, just in case she comes back. ",Modern
231972," So you can see that it's still destabilising? Me being here is going to kill us both. You may want us to be together, but it's not working. It can never work. ",Modern
204290," Ah, yes, but I didn't have this plan then, did I? Riddell? Keep an eye out for dinosaurs. ",Modern
209362," All those years, burying you in my memory. ",Modern
207564, It was just a stupid joke. We did it to relieve the boredom. ,Modern
188505," Given the current crisis. Torchwood, this is Sarah Jane Smith. ",Modern
206641, A sinking submarine? ,Modern
222468, You see? ,Modern
218377, If you say so. ,Modern
183616, I beg your pardon? ,Modern
173345," Oh yeah, ten times. Still, your friends aren't bad. I'll give you that. ",Modern
214815, This is Maebh's. Where did you get this?,Modern
235589," Wow. So you were quite the catch, then. ",Modern
166386," Seven hundred and eight. Next week, it's seven hundred and nine. I'm having my blood bleached. Is that why you wanted a word? You could be flatter, Rose. You've got a little bit of a chin poking out. ",Modern
175123, I've been phoning and phoning her. There's no reply. ,Modern
197708, I know. Bless.,Modern
184513," Why, where have you been? ",Modern
188346," How do you mean, cold case? ",Modern
179174, You saw me last night. ,Modern
189013," Because you two were just Time Lords, you dumbos, lacking that little bit of human. That gut instinct that comes hand in hand with Planet Earth. I can think of ideas you two couldn't dream of in a million years. Ah, the universe has been waiting for me. Now, let's send that trip switch all over the ship. Did I ever tell you, best temp in Chiswick? Hundred words per minute. ",Modern
176645," Why, what happened then? ",Modern
208477, Who are you? What have you done to her? ,Modern
240084," Those are my notes, maps and labels relating to these doors. Madam, they are all to be approached with caution.  ",Modern
219639, Morpheus?,Modern
204432," I'm just saying, if we knew that ",Modern
194739, I'm the last of my species. ,Modern
218739, Nothing. Nothing at all. ,Modern
208925," Oh, I've seen conflict like you wouldn't believe. But it wasn't this face. But never mind that, your Majesty. Up on your feet. Up, up. ",Modern
234731, Tesla said it should be just... Here! This tunnel leads us back to Wardenclyffe. ,Modern
212637, Soup?,Modern
196870," Come on, Doctor, come on. ",Modern
225313," I once built a gun out of leaves. Do you think I couldn't get through a door if I wanted to? I'm here, all right?  I'm engaging with the process. ",Modern
228582," Not sure your stomach's compatible with time travel, Graham.",Modern
205226, It could do with a repaint. ,Modern
211911," No, no, no, no, no. The date's fine. Come on.",Modern
166315, What does it matter? ,Modern
224667,"  Bill, is that you? ",Modern
206759," Well, the Cold War won't stay cold for ever, Captain. ",Modern
224098, It shows. ,Modern
238420, Are you seeing that? ,Modern
237359, Cheers. ,Modern
187427, Like an immigrant? ,Modern
202822," Thank you, dear. ",Modern
195212, Don't say that. ,Modern
213019, And we travel the universe in it.,Modern
209610," Ooo, vortex cooking? ",Modern
174847, This is your freedom. Free to die. You're going into that black hole and I'm riding with you. ,Modern
175958, I don't think so. ,Modern
202511," Thank you for bringing me, Gantok. ",Modern
199475, You're a copy. You're just pretending to be like her. ,Modern
208408," Oh, I like the new desktop. ",Modern
171878," Very much. Oh, completely. And that's the charm of a ghost story, isn't it? Not the scares and chills, that's just for children, but the hope of some contact with the great beyond. We all want some message from that place. It's the Creator's greatest mystery that we're allowed no such consolation. The dead stay silent, and we must wait. Come. Begin your tale, Sir Robert. There's a chill in the air. The wind is howling through the eaves. Tell us of monsters. ",Modern
201708," Blimey, that was a bit quick. ",Modern
186274," Okay, here it comes.   Hello? ",Modern
172498, Affirmative. ,Modern
202118,"   Yes, that's it. That's all. It's the lights. ",Modern
167300, They're aliens. ,Modern
176586," Hold on, hold on. ",Modern
229996, Making the incision. ,Modern
219326, What is it that you actually want? ,Modern
186217, You have a mouth that won't stop. You think there's danger here?,Modern
233989," Not a drill. Repeat, not a drill. ",Modern
235886, Would you kip here tonight?,Modern
176372," That's forty five floors up! Believe me, I've done them all. ",Modern
238293, I have analysed the psychic waves and it is my privilege to report the cataclysm approaches. The Flux is imminent. I forecast incredible suffering. Vast bloodshed.  A conflict that will dwarf all that has come before. The greatest of times are upon us. We must be ready to take advantage.  ,Modern
236513, Show me.   What happened to you? ,Modern
232064, We can answer it for you. Do you want us to activate it? ,Modern
230898," Hang on, how are you going to get down there? ",Modern
225383, You tricked us. You tried to make us believe the Monks were invaders. How could you say that? They've always been here. You know that. ,Modern
206009, Because you changed your mind? ,Modern
207141, Sorry? ,Modern
198663, The Tardis! ,Modern
205953, Will it show up on the bill? ,Modern
171335, Have you got everything? ,Modern
234193," Shut up. I will shoot you. Where's the maintenance teleport, Kane? ",Modern
191166, I need that information. ,Modern
186288, What's that? I didn't do that. Did you do that? ,Modern
168073," He's all on his own, Doctor, and he did help. ",Modern
227558," Ryan, love. Our train's stopped between Hathersage and Grindleford, and something really weird's going on.   ",Modern
175702," Just, just, just put me down! ",Modern
205089, She's holding you very tight. ,Modern
194596," Hacking into your records. Probe reports, samples, sensors. Good. Just unite the data, make it all one big conversation. Let's have a look. So, we are here and this is your drill hole. Twenty one point zero zero nine kilometres. Well done. ",Modern
173565, Your words are irrelevant. ,Modern
197969, Why don't you ask her?,Modern
220674, Run like hell.  ,Modern
180130, Stop it. I get boys causing less fuss than this. ,Modern
195750," Hey, I thought I'd come early and meet your new flat mate. ",Modern
201868," Okay, but what are we actually going to do? ",Modern
185642, Look sharp. We have guests. ,Modern
187183," Okay, can you stop? ",Modern
190008," Coming from you, sir, that means the world. ",Modern
236408, This place keeps on folding in on itself as well. ,Modern
235295, What's that? ,Modern
198039, What does it mean if the light's flashing? What did I just tell you? ,Modern
240643, Where's the exit? ,Modern
222496, Where are we?,Modern
229787," Well, medicine, science, engineering, candyfloss, Lego, philosophy, music, problems, people, hope. Mostly hope. ",Modern
167005, The police are urging the public not to panic. There's a help line number on screen right now if you're worried about friends or family. ,Modern
221811," Nothing. Oh, look!",Modern
240493," Well, that's a board game.  ",Modern
201028, They're getting closer. ,Modern
221747, What  are you doing here? ,Modern
195214," Doctor, help him. ",Modern
204332, We're flying a spaceship. ,Modern
181177, Sally Sparrow. ,Modern
180441," Careful, Son of Mine. This is all for you so that you can live forever. ",Modern
240351," My impact may be minimal, but I'll try.  ",Modern
166122, Did they kill him? Mickey? Did they kill Mickey? Is he dead? ,Modern
221117," Oh, there were tears. And just a hint of screaming. ",Modern
189799, Don't be ridiculous. That's Quatermass. ,Modern
201690, Mmm hmm. ,Modern
204427, A minor infection we'd found a treatment for centuries ago. ,Modern
174135, We have nothing else in life. ,Modern
185925," Doctor, stop it. The murderer is as human as you or I. ",Modern
192114," Yes, but only food refuse. Organic, coming through feeder tubes from all over the ship. ",Modern
195448," No. It's a thing. It's like a plan, but with more greatness. ",Modern
231254," I like your granny. Completely normal. No magic, and no signs of any sickness. ",Modern
205491, Yes. ,Modern
200428," I mean, I'd love to. He's gorgeous. He's my favourite guy. But he's, you know ",Modern
195161, Toxic fumigation initiated. ,Modern
226654, Any requests? ,Modern
227192, Yeah. ,Modern
227441," You know, I could swear it's coming from both sides. ",Modern
235605, That's what I was thinking. We're so sympa. ,Modern
220445, They only attack if you make any attempt to leave.  ,Modern
233856, Fine. What do you want to know? ,Modern
195521, I only wish I had something of real value to give you. ,Modern
226562,   It's got your name on the label.  I also have key to operating theatre. I clean up on Wednesdays.,Modern
234516, All right. We all know Edison. It's Tesla you've never heard of.  ,Modern
240091, I missed you.  ,Modern
172036, Where is the wolf? I don't trust this silence. ,Modern
180292, Don't you think discipline is good for them? ,Modern
196311," Fine. Oh, you're the guy, yeah? The one who did the swordy thing. ",Modern
202983, For God's sake! ,Modern
167112," You disappear, who do they turn to? Your boyfriend. Five times I was taken in for questioning. Five times. No evidence. Course, there couldn't be, could there? And then I get her, your mother, whispering around the estate, pointing the finger. Stuff through my letterbox, and all 'cos of you. ",Modern
220916, I'm on it. The capsule is really close. ,Modern
223957," Space doors are supposed to go shk-shk, not urrrrr. ",Modern
177080, Just be glad it does. ,Modern
231959, But I can't. ,Modern

240262," Yes! It's in the details.   DOCTOR2; The make-up of the Flux, the primary material.    Anti-matter, created outside of our universe and channelled in.  ",Modern
175986," That's lucky. You see, everyone at Torchwood has at least a basic level of psychic training. This paper is blank, and you're a fake. Seal the room. Call security. Samuel, can you check the door locks? She just walked right in. ",Modern
176313," Technology using the one thing a Dalek can't do. Touch. Sealed inside your casing. Not feeling anything ever, from birth to death, locked inside a cold metal cage. Completely alone. That explains your voice. No wonder you scream. ",Modern
207445, Sensor detects everything you could possibly want. ,Modern
200396," Mels, did you not understand the question? I'm asking you why the Titanic sank? ",Modern
178283," Break a leg, sweetheart.   Tallulah? ",Modern
192222, I voted for this. Why would I do that? ,Modern
201317," Amy, I'm taking the Time Glass back to the Tardis. Like satnav, I'll use it to get a lock, then smash through using the Tardis to get you out. Until then, you're on your own. ",Modern
219036," The invasion has happened. You're probably surrounded by Zygons. Get to the Tardis, get yourself safe.",Modern
225944, This is the safest place to be. The beast is still out there.,Modern
224486, Possa il Signore illuminare il vostro cammino. ,Modern
220533," You really are thick, aren't you? The Doctor is back on Gallifrey. Took  him four and half billion years to get here. What do you think he's  going to do now?     Why, he's stealing a Tardis and running away.  Bye!",Modern
175693, A storm's approaching.,Modern
179566, We'll get out of this. I promise. ,Modern
208881, I was thinking ,Modern
192385," Well, let's just ask, shall we? ",Modern
189538," Go, go, go. ",Modern
233787, Over here. ,Modern
168232, At last. She's clever. ,Modern
187166, That noise from outside. It's stopped. ,Modern
173525, He is superior. The Lumic Unit has been designated Cyber Controller. ,Modern
181359, Nothing? ,Modern
225947, The gate. ,Modern
201821, He died. ,Modern
222813, Do you know why? You're an awesome tutor. ,Modern
188086, Can I have a coffee?,Modern
184081," Well, I'd suggest a post mortem. Which means it's got to be dead first. ",Modern
172626," So has she got plans of being the Queen, then? ",Modern
207867, But what's the connection to Mrs Gillyflower? Judgement will rain down on us all. An empty mill. ,Modern
230658," Kandokan labour laws. Ever since the People Power protests, companies have to make sure a minimum ten percent of the workforce are actual people, at all levels.  Like the slogan says, real people need real jobs. Work gives us purpose, right? ",Modern
180757, Why not? ,Modern
231578," Oh, look at that. Someone got a bit overexcited with the DIY. ",Modern
220690, Clara?   ,Modern
207855," There, there. Hello, stranger. ",Modern
223637, I know what you mean. ,Modern
226738, Sorry. It's just. ,Modern
207954, Ouch. ,Modern
181601, Regeneration. Regeneration. ,Modern
187518," Now listen to me. Listen to me right now, because you need me, all of you. If we are going to get out of this, then you need me. ",Modern
176509, Tell me where I am. I demand you tell me right now where am I? ,Modern
199437, Keep going straight. Can't miss it. But you're never going to get your vehicle in here. ,Modern
204528," Everyone who isn't an American, drop your gun. ",Modern
200657," Amelia. Amelia, please. ",Modern
198336, After effect of the Silence. Natural enough. That's not what I was asking. You told me you were pregnant. ,Modern
195343," Yes, I'm used to it. ",Modern
203944, With you? They're with you? Are they the new us? Is that why we haven't seen you? ,Modern
168783," Quickly as you can, down to the shelter. ",Modern
215052, Good.,Modern
240035, How did that get here?  ,Modern
207699, Thank you for agreeing to this meeting. I'm told you are the investigator to see if there are strange goings-on. ,Modern
218126, Aye!  ,Modern
184398," Unified Intelligence Taskforce. Raise that barrier, now!     Leave those safeties on, lads. They're non-hostiles. ",Modern
216949, I still do.,Modern
188160," Oh, I know why you want a job with HCClements, lady. Because you think you'll meet a man. ",Modern
239846," Yes, you use it to talk with people, to communicate.  ",Modern
198888, Stay put. Stay exactly where you are.,Modern
221287, She's lying. ,Modern
208267, There's at least a dozen more shots left in the gun before it needs to recharge. ,Modern
179821, Jettison reactivated. ,Modern
177197," Funny time to take a snack. You'd think she'd be hiding. Unless. No. Yes, that's it. Wait a minute. Yes! Shape-changer. Internal shape-changer. She wasn't drinking blood, she was assimilating it.",Modern
227531, Look at you. You're a Fed. ,Modern
207185," No, not everything. Not love. Not always. ",Modern
175553, The Isolus has caused a lot of pain for these people. ,Modern
231429, It has been long enough. ,Modern
232948, No! ,Modern
207357," Oh, yes. Big friendly button. ",Modern
170456, The female will stand. Stand! ,Modern
230767, It's not exactly cryptic.  ,Modern
198842," You told me about your people, and you told me what you did. ",Modern
212863, I'm a caretaker. Don't mind me.,Modern
178269, Where's Tallulah? ,Modern
223717, So this house is eating people? ,Modern
202003, There's a list on the fridge. ,Modern
176600," Oh, answer the phone!",Modern
239607," At the edge of the village, it's just stars. It's like we're marooned in space and it's creeping in on us.",Modern
194766, You're going to negotiate with these aliens? ,Modern
200698, You said he was dying. ,Modern
204588, Right. ,Modern
231186," I will still be with you. In the water, in the fire. In the earth, in the air. ",Modern
194681, That is rubbish. ,Modern
235038, You can come in now. ,Modern
188889, Going to tell me what a Warp Star is? ,Modern
232650, Have you told Lin? ,Modern
176627, Doesn't matter. ,Modern
179116," Martha, are you there? Pick it up, will you? ",Modern
222928, I did listen. What did I miss? The Vardy have killed our families. ,Modern
226765," Er, a Cyberman. ",Modern
212950," Where are you, my sleeping beauty?  Gotcha. Let's dance!",Modern
233026, I'd be a great spy. I'd just blend in. ,Modern
176843, Off we go. ,Modern
182404," Hey, I need that. ",Modern
198634, We haven't moved. We're in exactly the same place as before. ,Modern
189906, They must do. ,Modern
172323, But he's metal! ,Modern
229221," We need to move out of this area, quick. It's too dark, too deserted. Spiders love that. We need to go somewhere bright and busy.  ",Modern
195979, Craig. ,Modern
171487," I'm on my way, governor. ",Modern
202218, All right. Don't have a go at me just because I don't know the names.,Modern
201891," My master, my lord. I'm here! ",Modern
210630," I burned an ancient, beautiful creature for one inch of optic nerve. What do you think you can accomplish, little man?",Modern
171999, I don't know. I suppose. ,Modern
196343, One of the fellows. ,Modern
200768," They can.   Rory, go! ",Modern
227456," Well then, here we go. The long way round.  ",Modern
231090, We do this every Sunday. ,Modern
239021," Quit the game.   You have to keep your eyes on it. If the Angel gets you, it will propel you back in Time. I won't know where you are. You could be lost forever  and I won't be able to find you. Yaz, I'm being pulled away... ",Modern
229156," My hotel, my rules. You were fired, yet instead of leaving, you bring someone else in. ",Modern
219684, Sleepmen bad. Kill sleepmen.,Modern
180190," Now don't be ridiculous. You do get these notions! It's all very well, those Suffragettes. but that's London. That's miles away. ",Modern
226637," In fact, do you know what I'd call it? I'd call it a genesis. ",Modern
222979, Do what? ,Modern
239674," We've got a task, we have to stick to it.  ",Modern
207967, No. No. Just thought you might like it. ,Modern
222606, Seriously?  ,Modern
201520, I will not help her. ,Modern
180454," She's almost brave, this one. ",Modern
217086, Twenty feet.,Modern
223086," Bioluminescence. Fireflies, glow-worms. ",Modern
214251," Have we done as much as we could? No. Do we have any suspects? No. Off the record, I think the top brass are hoping if they ignore this it'll all just go away. ",Modern
206723, I slept for five thousand years? ,Modern
196385, Just go. ,Modern
208885, No more. ,Modern
185443, Got it! ,Modern
189133," Brilliant! Fantastic! Molto bene! Great big universe, packed into my brain. You know you could fix that chameleon circuit if you just tried hotbinding the fragment links and superseding the binary, binary, binary, binary, binary, binary, binary, binary, binary, binary, binary, binary, binary, binary.   I'm fine. Nah, never mind Felspoon. You know who I'd like to meet? Charlie Chaplin. I bet he's great, Charlie Chaplin. Shall we do that? Shall we go and see Charlie Chaplin? Shall we? Charlie Chaplin? Charlie Chester. Charlie Brown. No, he's fiction. Friction, fiction, fixing, mixing, Rickston, Brixton.   Oh, my God. ",Modern
172595," I'm the Doctor, and I just snogged Madame de Pompadour. Ha, ha!",Modern
181499, Chan don't touch the cables tho. ,Modern
174094," But if there's no atmosphere out there, what's that? ",Modern
168365, Oh. I was hoping for a philosophical debate. Is that all I'm going to get? Yes? ,Modern
204853, Remotely isn't my style. See you after.   Geronimo. ,Modern
185895, Camptown Races? ,Modern
230823," I was being honest with you earlier. We got a message that someone needed help, and we came. People are vanishing, and Mister Slade is keeping a running tally.   Seven people so far. According to these notes, it started four months ago with two workers. The next month, another. This month, four. The disappearances are on the increase.  No wonder people are sending out cries for help. And as Head of People for Kerblam, I'd suggest you're guilty of some serious negligence. ",Modern
222600, You never thought of bringing the seats a bit closer? ,Modern
208744, Clara. You can hear me. I know you can. ,Modern
211536, Guard! Guard! Guard! Guard! Guard! Guard!,Modern
214252, Apparently they're in the walls. ,Modern
202342," It's like you said, Doctor. Got to believe you can do it. ",Modern
210063," You will die now, Doctor. This is the end of you.   The rules of regeneration are known. You have expended all your lives. ",Modern
172675," Oh dear, Reinette. You've had some cowboys in here.",Modern
182164," No, it's my turn. Revenge! Best served hot. And this time, it's a message for Miss Jones.",Modern
201886," Yes, well, we saw how that idea got shot down in flames. ",Modern
226402," Oh, awake, is it? Awake now. Good, settle. ",Modern
219942, Oh. ,Modern
238064, Daniel Lewis. This could be him.  ,Modern
174227," I've seen films and things, yeah. They say black holes are like gateways to another universe. ",Modern
212643," It's just a phone, Clara. Nothing happens when you answer the phone.",Modern
223296, Okay. I get it. ,Modern
236535, Shelley's going to die if that stuff stays inside him. ,Modern
185581, What is it? ,Modern
240616," What? No, no. We're stuck in a time loop with killer robots. ",Modern
178591," Does it look like I'm kidding? Inside that shell is a creature born to hate, whose only thought is to destroy everything and everyone that isn't a Dalek too. It won't stop until it's killed every human being alive. ",Modern
199298, Doctor? Are you all right? ,Modern
199111, Hold on. ,Modern
211837, Me too.,Modern
197389, We have five minutes max. We need to land. ,Modern
168863, Yeah. Nancy always gets the best food for us. ,Modern
186712," You remember my face, then? The memories are all still there. The library, the Doctor, me. You've just been programmed not to look. ",Modern
230648, Product incoming. ,Modern
189665, And what's home? ,Modern
218123, If necessary.  ,Modern
182708, I know. I never told you. I dialed the competition line five thousand times. That's five thousand credits. I might as well have paid for the tickets. I've been hiding the vone bill for months now. ,Modern
183812, No way. ,Modern
237628," No, no, no. Don't give me that. Right? I see what you're doing. You're trying to avoid the subject. We've known each other long enough now. I know when something's changed. ",Modern
213194, Okay. I promise.,Modern
232399," Yeah. Oh, I couldn't do it, Doc. Yeah, I had the chance. Too weak. ",Modern
169962, It's not just any old power source. It's the Tardis. My Tardis. The best ship in the universe. ,Modern
192677," Oh, it doesn't work like that, Winston, and it's going to be tough. There are terrible days to come. The darkest days. But you can do it. You know you can. ",Modern
176238, Daleks? ,Modern
179795, Keep going. ,Modern
240322, I wasn't. I promise. It was his fault.  ,Modern
171494, Boat race. ,Modern
168933, Shall we try and get along without the psychic paper? ,Modern
216612, I didn't save your life. You had a splinter.,Modern
226485," Ah. It's a good thing you've got all those locks, then, in case I accidently wander off. Yeah. Better get mopping.   Don't change the channel. ",Modern
188552, You did not. ,Modern
201122," Doctor, the lift. ",Modern
234328, You open the drive core and isolate the syrillium 3. ,Modern
221291," No, it isn't. ",Modern
177828," Oi! Oi, you! Over here! Over here! Buy some Happy! ",Modern
226500, They don't. ,Modern
230272, Wouldn't put it quite like that but you're getting the gist. ,Modern
237072," Now, the Boundary between worlds, this beautiful anomalous fluke",Modern
195458," Are you okay? You seem a bit, if I didn't know you better, I'd say nervous. ",Modern
224364, Promise. ,Modern
188272, Spaceships.,Modern
202658," But does it matter? I mean, can't we just stay like this? ",Modern
198709," What if I stay with him, here. The Siren will look after him. I can't go back to England. And what home does he have now, if not with me? ",Modern
193839, Now? You want to do this now? ,Modern
220978, You can't. ,Modern
182513," Red Six Seven. Red Six Seven. This way, fast as you can. ",Modern
227028, I know when you're crying them. Time to go. ,Modern
216155, Until you looked at them too long. Till you thought about them.,Modern
173426," Let's see where we are.   Already converted, just put on ice. Come on.   Let's go slowly. Keep an eye out for trip systems. ",Modern
180644," I'm not. I'm John Smith. That's all I want to be. John Smith, with his life, and his job, and his love. Why can't I be John Smith? Isn't he a good man? ",Modern
222936," That little boy, where did he go?",Modern
218542," Leandro, meet the Doctor. You thought I was helping you. In  fact, it was the other way round. Leandro, we have it. My friend here  was as useful as I'd hoped. ",Modern
175580," I mean, you can eat your dinner off this. Beautiful. So you tell me why the other one's got a lump in it when I gave it the same love and craftsmanship as I did this one. ",Modern
196365," If they've been to her house, they could have used her psychic residue. Structures can hold memories, that's why houses have ghosts. They could've taken a snapshot of Amy's memories. But why?",Modern
215582," The clouds caused by the exploding Cybermen, they haven't dispersed. They're still there. In fact, they've expanded and are covering almost all the land masses. We're all looking at the graveyards. Maybe we should be looking up? What do you think?",Modern
198249, Sleep. ,Modern
223781," I'd be more concerned for yourself, Doctor. Your advanced age means you have less energy, less matter, but they'll take what they can get. ",Modern
196317, Because you never existed. ,Modern
183643," Evelina said you'd come from far away. Please, have you ever seen anything like it? ",Modern
197232, This one.,Modern
225235," Well, let's just say.   Yes, yes, yes, I found him. ",Modern
189118," But it's better than that, though. Don't you see what he's trying to give you? Tell her. Go on. ",Modern
190148, He was wearing this thing. I have never seen anything like it. ,Modern
237039," Down you come. That's it. Yaz, come on. ",Modern
239353, Do you not think evacuation might not be the order of the day?,Modern
199206," I'm looking at these readings, Jimmy, and the potency stats are way too low. We may have to take that read again. This thing is still jamming up on me. ",Modern
171426," I mean, you never know what your life is going to be like, ever. I'm bored with this drink. Anyway. Oh, hello darling! Now, don't. Stop it. ",Modern
187751, What do you think it was? ,Modern
236877, Yeah.   We landed. ,Modern
240512, Not sure. Never had to do this before. ,Modern
190266," If you remember anything, let me know straight away.",Modern
214723," Ow! Look, sir. No rings. Trees usually have rings to tell you how old they are. This one's got no rings. Why's that then, sir? ",Modern
211990," So, plan? Plans are good.",Modern
196278," Yes, I know that, Rory. I'm not exactly one to miss the obvious. But we need everything we can get. Okay, Cyberweapons. This is basically a sentry box, so headless wonder here was a sentry. Probably got himself duffed up by the locals. Never underestimate a Celt. ",Modern
214256," I don't know. Maybe they thought we weren't doing enough, sir.   Can I call you back? ",Modern
214225," You really do throw your companions in at the deep end, don't you?",Modern
236819," The Cyberium has given me understanding. It has distilled my purpose. I am the perfect vessel. Everything is in me for the ascension  of the Cybermen, and beyond. ",Modern
216510, Perfume. ,Modern
229796, Asteroid field. Fast-moving asteroids all around. Really unpredictable. ,Modern
189681, Hey. ,Modern
183207, I'm in church. ,Modern
218548, You invite your own death? ,Modern
179203, Energy deficit. Always happens with this kind of process. ,Modern
228055," Doctor, these stabiliser handles don't feel very stable. ",Modern
195501, Talking to him? ,Modern
227321, Seriously. You're looking right at me and you don't even know I'm here. ,Modern
205055," Ah, hello, yes.   Special commission from the Emperor.",Modern
211539, Oh.,Modern
215605,"   Hey, Missy, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey, Missy. Hey.   Excuse me. Hi. Can I tell you something really important?",Modern
168984, What would we be negotiating? ,Modern
197942, Not a great moment. ,Modern
210525, We've got one shot at this.  Go.  Have you got it? ,Modern
222912, And all of this took how long? One morning? All of these people were slaughtered in a day? ,Modern
230622, Yeah. ,Modern
188262," He is funny, though. ",Modern
231465," I have let Satan in. I have failed you, sire. Yes, I am the witch! ",Modern
186718," Look at your children. Look at all of them, really look.   They're not real. Do you see it now? They're all the same. All the children of this world, the same boy and the same girl, over and over again. ",Modern
223066," I caught the fish myself, miss. Made it right here in the old...  Hey! What are you about? ",Modern
174621, Right. ,Modern
211336," No. No, not at all.   Not me.",Modern
169632," I told you, you don't need a passport. ",Modern
230096," I mean, I could, but I shouldn't. Unless... No, too unpredictable. ",Modern
211142, Prepare fourteen Daleks.,Modern
201646, Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness. Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness. Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness. ,Modern
177816, Oh! You should have said. How long you been there? Happy. You want Happy. ,Modern
210038," No, Doctor. ",Modern
182409, I really don't know. ,Modern
181695,   It's a gas mask. ,Modern
206020," Okay, we're finished now. ",Modern
185583, So why are we suddenly in Kew Gardens? ,Modern
168511, Sorry. Force of habit. ,Modern
209613, What's that? ,Modern
220263," Yes, sir. ",Modern
186660, It's midnight. ,Modern
227655, Why's it in a tree? ,Modern
190408, I never saw him again. ,Modern
234317, Which is what syrillium 3 mutates into when it's attacked by the hopper virus. ,Modern
166648, I thought you said you were my fan. ,Modern
235313," Gabriela, there's no way in hell we're camping here tonight.",Modern
197752, I don't know. I just ,Modern
219866," No, no, no, no, no. Don't start using my actual name now. Call me Pudding Brain, call me Local Knowledge. Whatever.  Just don't call me Rigsy. You're going to save me. You're a doctor. That's what you do. ",Modern
237086, All right? ,Modern
181567, Where did you get it? ,Modern
175771, Yeah. ,Modern
216882," Then you will harm nobody in this place. Not one person. Are we very, very clear?",Modern
179345, He's inside! ,Modern
194969," Show me Alaya. Show me, and release her immediately unharmed, or we kill your friends ",Modern
172536, Goodnight Monsieur. ,Modern
236946, And we're in the middle of stealing it. ,Modern
180311, That scarecrow's all skewed. ,Modern
211540," I did, in fact.",Modern
189730," That must be nice. It's Christina de Souza. To be precise, Lady Christina de Souza. ",Modern
166729," Come on, times haven't changed that much. I bet you've done the same. ",Modern
170198, Blaidd Drwg. ,Modern
222771, Smiley face.  ,Modern
189306, You've got a balloon. ,Modern
202722, Did you? ,Modern
234123, I need to check where we are. ,Modern
191695, I can be a nurse. ,Modern
181563," Martha, this watch is me. I'm going to become human. ",Modern
169049, Don't touch the flesh. ,Modern
187547, Do we have a deal? ,Modern
221263," Long live the King.   The Pandorica Opens. Ooh, that sounds exciting. And goodness me, a picnic at Asgard. Some people really know how to snack, don't they? ",Modern
198935, It's House. He's after the Tardis. Just get out both of you.,Modern
187180, I'm trying to help. ,Modern
211160, Secure the door! Wasp fighters to action stations. Wasp fighters to action stations.,Modern
209871," Because if I hadn't, I'd have buried you a long time ago. ",Modern
181662," But this Master bloke, he's got the Tardis. He could be anywhere in time and space. ",Modern
190504," Get back, Steffi! ",Modern
240510, Where's the beach? ,Modern
221121, Consider it done.   Is the gentleman here for dinner? ,Modern
230173, Defo? Totally sure?  ,Modern

177230," Have you seen them? There are these things. These great big space rhino things. I mean, rhinos from space. And we're on the moon! Great big space rhinos with guns on the moon. And I only came in for my bunions, look. I mean, all fixed now. Perfectly good treatment. The nurses were lovely. I said to my wife, I said I'd recommend this place to anyone, but then we end up on the moon. And did I mention the rhinos? ",Modern

If I were you, I'd say they worked something like this.   See? Compressed information. Tons of it. That is the history of London, 1066 to the present day. This is like a disc, a Cyberdisc. But why would the Cybermen need something so simple? They've got to be wireless. Unless, they're in the wrong century. They haven't got much power. They need plain old basic infostamps to update themselves. Are you all right? ",Modern

176991," I know, but think what it's going to look like for Mum, if you're standing there with Annalise. ",Modern
189357, Incorrect. You do not correspond to our image of the Doctor. ,Modern
185436," Oh, come off it. You're the most anomalous bloke I've ever met. ",Modern
219677," To die? They wouldn't thank you for that. Nor you, Clara. To die, to die. Glamis hath murdered sleep, therefore Cawdor shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more. ",Modern
197586, He's dead. ,Modern
186554," Ooo, you've got bit of a stammer there. Bless. ",Modern
169359," If ever he was a Captain, he's been defrocked. ",Modern
185026," Upon arrival on board this ship, your students would have been shot down. Perhaps they were more clever then you thought. ",Modern

236560, What just happened? ,Modern
201258," Er, Amy? Stay calm. Stay still. Ah, time's gone wobbly. I hate it when it does that. ",Modern

196243, Your house. ,Modern
241075, Pulse feels way beyond anything feasible for 19th-century humans. What was on here? ,Modern
172533," Oh, it's just a routine fire check. Can you tell me what year it is? ",Modern
190454, Access denied. Access denied. ,Modern
206415, I know the perfect box. ,Modern
235296," I know what you're doing. Siding with them, distracting me. You're doing this deliberately. Whoa. Multiple alerts across three continents here on Earth.  Can't be connected. Unless they are. Quick look? ",Modern

187498, Then tell us. ,Modern
237461, How did you manage to smuggle that in here? ,Modern
192014," Oh my God, I'm in my nightie. ",Modern
224342, But you said that we were going to die. ,Modern
175392," Maybe it was a mistake I mean, you scribble over something when you want to get rid of it, like a, like a drawing. Like a, a child's drawing. You said it was in the street. ",Modern
190954, Bwahahahahahaha! ,Modern
181554," You might be out there, somewhere. ",Modern
231374," Just as you hide behind Doctor, perhaps. ",Modern
231873, Hang on. Are you saying we're now on the Solitract plane? ,Modern
218285,   Just someone. Not the whole town. Just save someone. ,Modern
188512, Oi. So was I. ,Modern
195949, Yes. I know he's got a time engine in the flat upstairs. ,Modern
182957," Mister Frame, this is for the Doctor. He's gone down there on his own, and I, I can't just leave him. He's done everything he can to save us. It's time we did something to help him. ",Modern

224995, It made no difference. How could this make no difference? ,Modern
184037," Yeah, yeah, yeah.   What do you think? Growing back? Just a little bit? Like you'd know. ",Modern
206073, Yes. ,Modern
231951," Don't leave me, love. Not again. ",Modern
194733," Did you just shush me? Did you just shush me?   No, no, no. No, don't do that. No gas. No gas! ",Modern
206157, Whoever's after us spent the whole night looking for us. Are you tired? ,Modern
181189, Finito. All powered up. ,Modern
212409," Er, no. No way. You can do you what you like. I'm going to take my chances out there.",Modern
192062, Hmm. Good for them. Nothing changes. ,Modern
182783, I can't hold it! ,Modern

220197," The equipment in that room is consistent with an augmented ultra long-range teleport. So, I'm not more than a single light year from where I was, and I'm in the same time zone.   When the sun sets, I'll be able to establish an exact position by the stars. Then you'll have a choice. Come out, show yourself, or keep on hiding. Clara said I shouldn't take revenge. You should know, I don't always listen.  Oh, what's this? Well, are you gardeners? I hate gardening! What sort of a person has a power complex about flowers? It's dictatorship for inadequates. Or to put it another way, it's dictatorship. Come on! Chop, chop! The Doctor will see you now! Show me what you've got! I just watched my best friend die in agony. My day can't get any worse. Let's see what we can do about yours!  I know you. I've seen you before.   I used to know a trick, back when I was young and telepathic. Clearly, you can't make an actual psychic link with a door, for one very obvious reason. They're notoriously cross. I mean, imagine life as a door. People keep pushing past you. All of that knocking, but it's never for you. And you get locked up every night, so if you're just a little bit nice.  See, Clara? Still got it.   But I. Er,  I can't actually see a way out of this  I've finally run out of corridor. There's a life summed up. Oh, now this is new. I'm scared. I just realised that I'm actually scared of dying.  Something I said? What did I say?   Why did you stop?",Modern
238175," Yeah. Now, just going to take out his security systems before we get spotted and lay another hack.   Here, hold this. Where is it?  Ah. Leftover hopper virus particles should do the trick. Right. You find Dan and I'll confront Karvanista. Meet back here.  ",Modern
218317," Yes. Yes, she did. But Ashildr isn't just human any more. There's a little piece of alien inside her, so in a way, she's. In a way, she's a hybrid.  To Be Continued...",Modern
191747, What's happening? Why's it going dark?   So what's wrong with the sun? ,Modern
236080, How are you here? ,Modern
238463, Oh. Mrs Seacole could certainly do with your assistance. Our advance tomorrow is not without risk. ,Modern
212298," What, do you have to reach a high shelf?",Modern
216260," You just wake up. Just leave me here, please. ",Modern
224166, Where are we going?  ,Modern
168890," Mummy? Mummy? Please let me in, mummy. Please let me in, mummy. ",Modern
188730, It's the darkness. ,Modern
185379, Just stay where you are. ,Modern
219762, I think the Professor has been playing a long game. Am I right?,Modern
181057, Afraid so. ,Modern
200286, Dorium! ,Modern
193645, Blimey. ,Modern
216814, What does what say?,Modern
191882," Yeah, but this is the good bit. I mean, this is my favourite bit. Do you know what this phone is full of? Pictures of you. Every form you've learned to take, right here. Ooo, and being uploaded about now. And the final score is, no Tardis, no screwdriver, two minutes to spare. Who da man? Oh, I'm never saying that again. Fine. ",Modern

179508, I've got you. Hold on.,Modern
166146, Any way of stopping it? ,Modern
174375, What are they doing?,Modern
204599, Where are you from?,Modern
210677, How would you kill me?,Modern
188623, I saw your command ship fly into the jaws of the Nightmare Child. ,Modern
226607, Doctor! ,Modern
196507, Where's it going to get that? ,Modern
228221, I don't know you. ,Modern
241184, You want to know why I'm on this ship alone? My crew were taken. They're being held hostage by Guo Podai and the Black Flag Fleet. There's a ransom to pay  or they all die. You lost your father. I could lose my sons. ,Modern
233941, Heading to the east zone. I'll isolate it there. ,Modern
215578," Cos I thought she might be the Master, regenerated into female form? Your childhood friend, responsible for a number of previous incursions. ",Modern
185132, There's nothing I can do. ,Modern
202599, I did run. Running brought me here. ,Modern
166285," I hope so, else I'm out of a job. ",Modern
180202," Martha, there's nothing there. ",Modern
201127, We can't stay in here. We've got to get out! ,Modern

232267, By the Creator's will. ,Modern
213766," It was a heart attack. And if I hear anyone spreading rumours to the contrary, they'll be getting off at the next station, termination papers in hand. Are we clear?",Modern
167724, Shut it. ,Modern
181521," I've only just met him. The Doctor sort of travels through time and space and picks people up. God, I make us sound like stray dogs. Maybe we are. ",Modern
222816," You didn't see a space ship outside, did you? When the settlers first landed, they must have lived in it and built out from it, so it's still here, somewhere inside this building. Ah.   Bits of meteor damage. Flecks of rust. Rivets. Oh, I love rivets. A wall. A real, honest wall. Not made of tiny robots but made of any old iron.  ",Modern
193846," Yeah, it should have been me. ",Modern
221003, Than it is,Modern
236018, You can't be. ,Modern
183845," How could it be worse? Doctor, it's getting closer. ",Modern
226666," Well, we thought we might chuck you off the roof, but I wasn't sure how many regenerations you had left. ",Modern
224351, Yeah? ,Modern
173263, Come on! Get a move on! ,Modern
215440,"Would you like me to take a picture? Sorry, selfies are never as good, are they? And you're having a lovely moment. Hang on! ",Modern

167562, And who the hell are you? ,Modern
221437," The finest in all the galaxy, ma'am. ",Modern
226707, I can do this. They're not difficult. They're Cybermen. ,Modern
226114, We can. I'm ready. I'll guard the gate with you. I'll fight by your side. ,Modern
202209," Well, you love me, I've never excreted any weird alien gases at you. ",Modern
219113, She's answered. ,Modern
236629," What's wrong, Graham? Can't take the commando lifestyle? ",Modern
226217, Who are you?  ,Modern
227360," Oh, if you insist. ",Modern
196761, Morning! ,Modern
167934, Fall back! Fall back! ,Modern
199255," What are they, prisoners, or are they meditating, or what? ",Modern
212236, Have you got a plan?,Modern
217148, You can't kill a Dalek with a brooch.,Modern
236128," Get another job, then. ",Modern
193262," Yeah, there is. Course there is. This is a galaxy class ship. Goes for years between planet falls. So, what do they need? ",Modern
198586," Not my most dynamic plan, I realise. ",Modern
239317, Checking the batteries.,Modern
205253," The Angel, would it send me back to the same time? To him? ",Modern
232204, Our faith is handed down. The Creator is the cornerstone. ,Modern
228123, No...  ,Modern
170609," I knew it! I was all the way down Clifton Parade, and I heard the engines. I thought, there's only one thing that makes a noise like that. What is it? ",Modern
198724, I always worry about you. ,Modern
209314, You're about to murder millions of people. ,Modern
207832," Promise me you will not abandon me, Mama. Promise me that. ",Modern
232060, Here he is.  ,Modern
200088," Doctor, you will come with me right now. ",Modern
240896," Look, I took way too long to tell somebody that I liked them and then... the universe ended and everything got messy. I wouldn't want that to happen to you, Sheffield. ",Modern
198881, Poor old Time Lord. Too late. House is too clever. ,Modern
167759, Metaltron? ,Modern
186179, It's not dark. ,Modern
223822," I forget, you see, your human lifespan, it's, it's not long, is it. ",Modern
186756, The library? If my face ends up on one of those statues. ,Modern
167100," More like a mermaid. Victorian showmen used to draw the crowds by taking the skull of a cat, gluing it to a fish and calling it a mermaid. Now someone's taken a pig, opened up it's brain, stuck bits on, then they've strapped it in that ship and made it dive bomb. It must've been terrified. They've taken this animal and turned it into a joke. ",Modern
190626, Bwahahahahahaha!,Modern
178136," Novice Hame! No, hold on, get off. Last time we met, you were breeding humans for experimentation. ",Modern
166534," Gwyneth! Where are you, girl? Gwyneth!   Where've you been? I was shouting. ",Modern
211319," Oh. Soon, I expect. Or later. One of those. ",Modern
231136," Yeah, cos you are in special measures. ",Modern
230149, All the way from England. ,Modern
222550, I will.,Modern
192740, Yet still you're on board.,Modern
214389, Perhaps these creatures don't even understand that we need three dimensions to live in.   They may not even know that they're hurting us.,Modern
221714, May I take her?,Modern
223001, Last day before the thaw. Thought I'd better find a more reliable parking spot. ,Modern
200963, Wait. Hang on.   There's a switch. ,Modern
190356," Looks like it, yeah. ",Modern
211495, Take them. Kill the rest. Kill them all!,Modern
207882," I'm, I'm a friend. A friend of his. ",Modern
221251," Well, I refuse. King Hydroflax does not accept death. ",Modern
206383," So, why is everyone here? ",Modern
217848, And now we've got the writing. ,Modern
200893, Course not. You could be anyone. ,Modern
233979, How many people have you got staying here? ,Modern
191772, Amy. ,Modern
239824, You denied me my life!  ,Modern
233301," No, it can't be. I've been through Barton's records. There are thousands of photos of him online at all ages. If he's not human, that's one very  impressive legend he's put together. ",Modern
237535," Oh, she's good. ",Modern
186648," Hey! Hello, you two. Come here. Big hugs. Big Daddy hugs. ",Modern
171432, Oh that's just Chip. He's my pet. ,Modern
209554, I just need you to come for Christmas dinner. Just do that for me. Come to Christmas dinner and be my Christmas date. ,Modern
215607,"I have to whisper it. It's, like, so important to everyone on this plane. You'll get in trouble if you don't listen. ",Modern
238901," Said she'd been thinking about it properly. Couldn't bear spending the rest of her life with me, so thought she could do better. ",Modern
167592, I'm doing it now. ,Modern
208397, Prepare to die in agony for the glory of the Sontaran Empire! ,Modern
237624," What's happening with your home? You know, what happened to you on Gallifrey? ",Modern
217232," Cybermen suppress emotion. Daleks channel it through a gun. That's why they keep yelling exterminate. It's how they reload. So, let's go and kill them. Come on.",Modern
238997, What did you say? ,Modern
222673, That's a very offensive remark. Don't make personal remarks like that. ,Modern
207352, Doctor? ,Modern
167241, Why do you want to know? ,Modern
192566, Danny Boy to the Doctor. Danny Boy to the Doctor. Are you receiving me? Over. ,Modern
232538, Hi. ,Modern

203924, I'm going to kill him. ,Modern
188568, Can we follow it? ,Modern
223852," John!   My little boy, this has to end. ",Modern
240718, Not trapped. Never trapped. You won't win. You never win. ,Modern
236368, What do you speak of? What is a zombie? ,Modern
167341, We've got to tell someone. ,Modern
194535," Doctor, help me. Something's got me. ",Modern
198843," Yes, yes, but if they're like the Corsair, they're good one and I can save them. ",Modern
172549, It's okay. Don't scream. It's me. It's the fireplace man. Look. We were talking just a moment ago. I was in your fireplace. ,Modern
218732," Anyway, she got an A and so she has sent you a selfie. ",Modern
191694, I thought you were a nurse. ,Modern
213471, What?  ,Modern
170689, Advance guard have made it ,Modern
234475, Are you all right? ,Modern
187389," She's dangerous. It's my job to see that this vessel is safe, and we should get rid of her. ",Modern
213748, Can't you see it? ,Modern
193780," Okay. So, first we need to get back in there somehow. ",Modern
235775," Doc, come on! ",Modern
195723, What the hell was that?,Modern
173825, From her. ,Modern
221373, They ran for it. So should we. ,Modern
196449," I'm sorry, my love. ",Modern
240964, Explain? ,Modern
222854, I can't hear you!    This isn't as easy as it looks.,Modern
173116, Or maybe Lucy's just a bit thick. ,Modern
209491," Oh, never say nothing. Anyway, good to know my future is in safe hands. Keep a tight hold on it, Clara. ",Modern
180504," You speak with someone else's voice, Baines. Who might that be? ",Modern
231576, And what stopped you? ,Modern
168121," Hold on, wait a minute. Are you a test? Some sort of management test kind of thing? ",Modern
166725, Me too. ,Modern
216902," Yes. Goodbye.   Goodbye, Clara.",Modern
208605, The girl who died he tried to save. She'll die again inside his grave. ,Modern
232837," Short version. Alien psychopath, in its own tank, trying to bring loads more to Earth. I guess this is how they attacked it last time. ",Modern
178871, You have your Tardis. Take us across the stars. Find us a new home and allow the new Daleks to start again. ,Modern
170615, She's not coming back. ,Modern

237061," Well, it's quite hard to get deliveries out here, you know. I had hoped I'd fought my last battle a long time ago.  Still... this old general still knows a few tricks. ",Modern
213091," One thing, Clara. I'm a soldier, guilty as charged. You see him? He's an officer.  ",Modern

233911," Important not to panic. Humans always have the same reaction to a hopper virus. First you get the wiggly fingers, which is a warning the legs are about to go.   Luckily, this is where my hopper first-aid training kicks in. Need to get rid of these.   Then pinch your ear. ",Modern
166278, Okay.   What's your name? ,Modern

190042, He's flying the bus. ,Modern
215480, What's happening?,Modern
177010," Hippocrates himself expounded on the virtues of salt. Recommended the inhalation of steam from sea water. Though no doubt if he'd been afflicted with my students, results might have been rather more colourful. ",Modern
231504, Anti-Morax weapons. The smoke is toxic to Morax. Should be enough to fend them off so you can rescue King James and I can get to the tree.  ,Modern
203504, Hello? Hello? Carmen ,Modern
184299," Please have a drink, sir. ",Modern
208940, What does that mean? ,Modern

199076, Just hang on. ,Modern
177611, None on Earth has knowledge of us. ,Modern

233795," Oh, forget you heard that word, otherwise I've just disrupted the whole of history. Again.	Okay. Ah, my brain's fizzing. Good.  The Kasaavin posted an agent on every person on that map, because that's what spies do, what Barton does. They gather all the data.  Where does the DNA fit in? Kasaavin, technology, DNA. How are they all connected? Oh! Human DNA. That's what they were testing. ",Modern
183495, A face. A face of stone. ,Modern
166761, I can't take part in this. ,Modern

Please, this is our battle now, not yours. You gave us sanctuary. You got Yaz and Dan back to me.  You may just have helped save the universe, never mind the world. Your work is done.  ",Modern
240258," How are you... I mean, we doing? ",Modern
166293," Now then. Control, I'm at junction nineteen and I think the problem's coming from in here. I'll go inside and have a look.   What's that? Is something in there?   Oh! Who are you, then?   Hold on! I if you're an upgrade I just need to register you, that's all. Oh, come back.   Ah, there you are. Now, I just need to register your ident. Oh, there's two of you.

206442, Getting it wrong. Making Grandfather angry. ,Modern
175889," Thank you, Sebastian. I think it's very important to know everyone by name. Torchwood is a very modern organisation. People skills. That's what it's all about these days. I'm a people person. ",Modern

172049, Get to the observatory!   Good shot. ,Modern

190114," You too. Chops and gravy, lovely. ",Modern
239794," You don't remember. Hmm, why would you? I think my eyes are the same, even across the regenerations, but you wouldn't know.  ",Modern
241256," And now I'm certain you're lying, you are disposable. ",Modern
211991," You on the bed, I'm talking to you now. Go in peace. We won't look. Just go. If all you want to do is stay hidden, it's okay. Just leave.",Modern
208862," What does it matter? This is their biggest ever attack, sir. They're throwing everything at us ",Modern
199736, It got burnt while I was in the harness. ,Modern
225823, What on Earth are you talking about? ,Modern
167839, Because I'm here. How did it get to Earth? Does anyone know? ,Modern
211728," Liar! From my sky vessel, I shall rule omnipotent.",Modern
219730," Not this time.   There is a feed. Wireless. These images are being stored by someone. Collated. Nagata, look at this footage. What's wrong with it? What's wrong with it? ",Modern
226073, No. ,Modern
228884, Are you thinking what I'm thinking?,Modern
207418," She's going to die if you don't help me. Don't get into a spaceship with a madman. Didn't anyone ever teach you that? Okay, a little gently persuasion. Say thirty minutes. ",Modern
182236, We made ourselves so pretty. ,Modern
216673, I'll catch up.,Modern
234491, Remote control? You came up with that? ,Modern
237192, I'm not sure you can cope with much...  ,Modern

229556, Rough. What are you in for? ,Modern
180915, Complicated. ,Modern
217419, From the future. ,Modern

224267," Okay, get her out of her suit. Give her mine. ",Modern
179827, Someone's hacked into the systems. I can't reroute the generators. There's no way I'm going to be able to jump-start this ship! Who the hell did that!  Mc ,Modern
196861, Honeymoon suite? ,Modern
207117, Urgh. I'd rather have a nice cup of tea. ,Modern
239240," But the Tardis is broken and Time's out of sync, so how can you be sure it's gonna work?",Modern
195862," No, sorry, what's happening? Are you going to live with monkeys now? ",Modern
227012," Well, the Doctor's destroyed most of them, so it'll take them a while to regroup, before they find us again. ",Modern
173592," There's got to be something. There's got to be. Oh, yes. ",Modern
179011," The theatre! It's right above them, and, what, it's gone midnight? Can you get us inside? ",Modern
186491, Run!,Modern
176425," I've had a life with you for nineteen years, but then I met the Doctor, and all the things I've seen him do for me, for you, for all of us. For the whole stupid planet and every planet out there. He does it alone, mum. But not anymore, because now he's got me.   What're you ",Modern
193249," Ah, now you're getting it. You've bought us time though. That's good. I am good with time. ",Modern
223467, To find the house. ,Modern

215219, You have Wi-Fi here?   You. You have iPads in the afterlife?,Modern
227422," Yes, fine, absolutely. Just thinking. I told the wife I'd be home for Christmas. Funny how things work out. ",Modern
207778, Like something manky in a coal cellar. They keep turning up in t'canal. The Crimson Horror. ,Modern
192858," What, being a stone? ",Modern
196256," What, us? ",Modern
229471, Proper goodbye this time. ,Modern
190927," Your reputation precedes you, sir. I have no doubt you've laid traps. Perhaps explosives. A means of escape, or murder. But everything you've done to the Gate will be checked and double-checked before anyone stands inside.",Modern
191830," I'll get you his number. But watch him, he's a devil. ",Modern
202792," River! River, this is ridiculous. That would mean nothing to anyone. It's insane. Worse, it's stupid. You embarrass me. ",Modern
225648," We won't let you down, sir.",Modern
227527, Yeah. ,Modern
184079," Can't stand the place. Still, Warehouse Fifteen then. Come on. ",Modern
211850, Sorry.,Modern
209927, Not me. The Kovarian Chapter broke away. They travelled back along your timeline and tried to prevent you ever reaching Trenzalore. ,Modern
215919," Yeah, but it's time to start living in the real world, yeah? ",Modern
239426," Eustacius Jericho, proper scientist. Under siege from the impossible, doesn't even stop to be scared. Just wants to understand what's beyond his comprehension.",Modern

222856, Earth was evacuated.,Modern
171890, Where were you born? ,Modern
204107," If the Doctor trusts Amy, so do I. Stop doubting her. ",Modern
169159," The night your space-junk landed, someone was hurt. This was where they were taken. ",Modern
227776, How can you tell? ,Modern
205823, Argh! ,Modern
201997, Thank you. ,Modern
183374, Hang on. Instructions from the Adiposian First Family.,Modern
205056," Hello, sweetie. Let's see, crime boss with a collecting fetish. Whatever you don't let anyone else see has got to be your favourite. Or possibly your girlfriend.   So, girlfriend, then. ",Modern
237726," All right, look, so if your plan works and this set of Daleks kills his lot. ",Modern
214765, Something like that. ,Modern
237582, I just missed her. I never stopped to think... ,Modern
204665, I imagined mostly kissing. ,Modern
236034, Release. After all this time. ,Modern
185963, And it was no ordinary pregnancy. ,Modern
178825, Frank? ,Modern
238243," You hear that system advice? This is Serving Commander Inston-Vee Vinder of Kasto-Winfer-Foxfell, doing the unthinkable and leaving his post.  ",Modern
234650," I knew I had one in my tool box. Braxium Bouncer, Mark III. Found it at a bazaar. Bit wonky, but I can't take the Tardis.  This should give us enough power to transport me, Yaz and Tesla back here. But once I'm there, I can't jump back until it recharges itself.  Which, you know, I'm not worried about. Definitely. And you shouldn't be worried about it either. Not in the least. ",Modern
193578," Er, keep eating. ",Modern
211413,This isn't a real sandal.,Modern
172003," Nevertheless, that creature won't give up, Doctor, and we still don't possess an actual weapon. ",Modern
176014, But you killed them! ,Modern
200130," Colonel Manton, you will give the order for your men to withdraw. ",Modern
200598, What have you done? ,Modern
215257, Are you serious? X-ray water?,Modern
168500, My entire planet died. My whole family. Do you think it never occurred to me to go back and save them? ,Modern
168840," Oh, Nancy. ",Modern
215157," No. They were placed, after death. These are tombs. Water tombs, some sort of fluid, anyway.",Modern
188492, Hello? ,Modern
203666, I'm going to send you a map to that screen. I put your little friend somewhere safe. I can get you to him. ,Modern
233984, 19. ,Modern
187466, And the wiring. He went into that panel and opened up the wiring. ,Modern
222352, What an extraordinarily long and involved                   answer this is going to be.,Modern
204318," No, come on, Pond. You'll be there till the end of me. ",Modern
223563," For a man such as myself, discretion is second nature. So, a gathering. You're all here.   No, except one. ",Modern
208060," Right. Wonderful day out, Doctor, but time to get the kids home.",Modern
178789, Here you go. I got some more on the boil. ,Modern
240912, Halt! ,Modern
169663, It's a cloaking device. ,Modern

198829," So there are Time Lords here, then? ",Modern
213038, I don't elope.  ,Modern
212513, Another gift from the Architect. Shall we unwrap it?,Modern
227377, I don't mean what you ran away from. What were you running to? ,Modern
209087, Which one are you? What happened to the other one? ,Modern
192403," Doctor, it's the All Clear. You okay? ",Modern
230368, Are you coming or not? What's that? ,Modern
204641," Not today, though. ",Modern
168407, It's Cathica. ,Modern
237538," Yeah, they killed me once, long time ago. No big deal. ",Modern
172021," That's what it wants. It said so. The, the Empire of the Wolf. ",Modern
182004, What say I use this perception filter to walk up behind him and break his neck? ,Modern
219432," I've pieced together the rescue as best I could. If you're going to watch, then pay close attention. Your lives may depend on it.",Modern
167820, You sound like the Doctor. ,Modern
185458, I'm trying to save your life. ,Modern
228808," Managed to get Krasko's weapon off him, at least. ",Modern
208192," Cybermen have been extinct for a thousand years. Even one Anti-Cyber gun is a miracle. These things are hand-pulsers. Touch the back of a Cyberman's head, the electomagnetic pulse deactivates it. ",Modern
212436," Okay.  I don't know what it is. You may as well have a look. Well, what are they?",Modern
235738, Yeah. ,Modern
218751," Safeguards all round, completely fair on both sides. ",Modern
180777, You don't have to fight. ,Modern
185835," Mrs Christie, you must have twigged something. You've written simply the best detective stories. ",Modern
220751,"   Sorry, ma'am. This is him. This is the surgeon. ",Modern
234531," You want to make an appointment, speak to my secretary. ",Modern
182042, Jelly baby? ,Modern
230523, They're checking the land for people who don't belong. ,Modern
225413, Mum. ,Modern
222683, Who needs loos? There's probably an app for that. ,Modern
234422, Tesla! I knew you looked familiar.   It's only Nikola Tesla! ,Modern
205840, Why not? ,Modern
183477, Someone mention Vestal Virgins? ,Modern
169369," Sub-atomic robots. There's millions of them in here, see? Burned my hand on the console when we landed. All better now. They activate when the bulk head's sealed. Check you out for damage, fix any physical flaws. Take us to the crash site. I need to see your space junk. ",Modern
220181, What's the point of being a Doctor if I can't cure you?  ,Modern
212750, Bit intense looking. Did you see those eyebrows? Did he wink at you?,Modern
226266, How did you get on board? Is that your capsule? ,Modern
195855, What's wrong with staying here? I can't see the point of London.,Modern
198612, I swear he's making half this stuff up. ,Modern
181757," For better or for worse. Isn't that right, Harry? ",Modern
205381, Who are you? ,Modern
209693, You could summon your Tardis. ,Modern
226941, Time to go. ,Modern
239455," Oh, we don't get to ask names. It's what she does that matters. Here we go.",Modern
219858, Huh? ,Modern
181744," All of it. The school days, his degree, even his mother and father, it's all invented. Look, Harold Saxon never went to Cambridge. There was no Harold Saxon. The thing is, it's obvious. The forgery is screaming out and yet no one can see it. It's as if he's mesmerized the entire world. ",Modern
224244," I'm the Doctor. I will do everything in my power to save all your lives. And when I do, you will spend the rest of them wondering who I was and why I helped you.  If anyone's offering a better deal, be my guest. ",Modern
183634, Who is? Who's she? ,Modern
227517," There is something that just came in, if you want different.",Modern
227009," They still might come, your friends. ",Modern
208385, How?  De ,Modern
230291," Why, though? Why would the Thijarians target a holy man in the 1940s? Wait. You said you'd seen them before. Where?  ",Modern
216669," Well, a little while ago, a very long way from here, I was looking for a bookshop. Instead, I found a battlefield. Story of my life. I've seen many battlefields. But this one will be different. This one will be my last. The Magician's Apprentice - the actual episode broadcast 19th Sept 2015",Modern
217882," Ah, yes. Of course.",Modern
227883," Last one.   Get in. Okay, so now we just need to swing the arm round to meet that one. ",Modern
186007, Yes. ,Modern
222030," They're  security drones, that's all. ",Modern
233023, Ah! At least they managed to transport my Tardis without damage. ,Modern
167860, What? ,Modern
213876," You said capture, implying that you can't control this thing. And yet somehow you got it on board. How?",Modern
233953," Hyph3n, what the hell are you doing? Who's this? ",Modern
193522, Then tell me. ,Modern
178622, I'm sorry. So sorry. ,Modern
191246, We have contact.,Modern
229079, You think I should've gone with him? ,Modern
238827, Feeling's mutual. ,Modern
191432," Right, come on then, you lot. This photo is just with friends. Come on. And I want all of you in it. Come on. That's it. Well, friends, and Nerys. Oh, I'm only joking. Oh, look at her. ",Modern
202231, Craig! It's a coincidence. It happens. It's what the universe does for ,Modern
221582, What? ,Modern
236555," You didn't want to be this way. They hurt you, this modern Prometheus. You loved once. And were loved in return. You do not wish to kill. ",Modern
183677, It's not my decision. The Sisters chose for me. I have the gift of sight. ,Modern
241177, Yeah. ,Modern
200489," Bad smoke. Don't breathe the bad, bad, smoke. Bad, deadly smoke because somebody shot my Tardis! ",Modern
201476," How can you have a door without a wall?   Oh. Holographic wallpaper? Oh, sorry. Argh. ",Modern
213324, Who made you the boss?  ,Modern
224556, Why? ,Modern
181373," Sorry, what was your name? ",Modern
195081, It was me. I did it. ,Modern
227114,"   May I suggest, for your own safety, you step onboard my ship? ",Modern
190359, She was looking at the screen. At Earth. She wanted Earth. A world full of water. ,Modern
239113, We know each other. ,Modern

209687," Right. This is my personal teleport. I can put you down just outside the town. Find the source of the message and report back to me in one hour. And on your life, Doctor, you will cause no trouble down there. ",Modern
187752, No idea. ,Modern
172883, Your city. ,Modern
221332, Alert. Meteor storm imminent.,Modern
202702," Oh, she just sort of generally indicated. ",Modern
175616, It needs more than heat. ,Modern
232388, Grace.,Modern
214401, Really? That's nice of them.,Modern
221663, Like someone knocking at a  window.,Modern
168791," Well, if you know so much, tell me this. How can it be ringing? It's not even a real phone. It's not connected, it's not   Hello? Hello? This is the Doctor speaking. How may I help you? ",Modern
204264," You think I won't punish those who get in my way, whatever they're worth? ",Modern
221480, Not everything can be avoided. Not forever. ,Modern
188054," Don't you dare. I always imagined, your old age, I'd have put a bit of money by. Make you comfy. Never did. I'm just useless. You're supposed to say, no you're not. ",Modern
208487, Doctor? ,Modern
186727, How are you doing? ,Modern
179385, I heard the explosion. I guessed it was you. ,Modern
230690," Well, at least I'm working. Unlike half the galaxy. Suppose we've only got ourselves to blame. Whilst we were busy staring at our phones,  technology went and nicked our jobs.  ",Modern
173541, I'm the Doctor. ,Modern
213775, Are you sure about that?,Modern
207847, Strax! You're overexcited. Have you been eating Miss Jenny's sherbet fancies again? ,Modern
230946," Not Twirly speaking. The System. Kerblam. Help me, Doctor. Help me. Help me, Doctor. Help me.  ",Modern
198090, I sent him a message. ,Modern
172519," Yeah, someone's cooking. ",Modern
184277," It's always been an option. My grandfather drew up this plan. That's the advantage of a family run business, Doctor Ryder. The personal touch. ",Modern
188431,(The Tardis dematerialises. ,Modern
204076, Don't listen to him. He's just being mean because we captured him. ,Modern
188805," I kept hearing that noise, that heartbeat. ",Modern
193603," Oh, be serious. Compared to me, these Angels are more complicated than you, and it would take every one of them to amount to me, so get a grip. ",Modern
239882," No, there's nowhere near enough of it.  ",Modern
198917, How do you know? ,Modern
193675, It's you. It's all about you. Everything. It's about you. ,Modern
199267, Since you were hit by a solar wave. ,Modern
203673, How do I get past them? Amy! ,Modern
187227, It's got to be a trick. ,Modern
228977," I thought I told you to stay on the door, Kevin. ",Modern
167490," Cupboard by the sink, middle shelf. ",Modern
213682," Our last, yeah. I mean, it's not like I'm never going to see you again.",Modern
185680," Now, my lady. What about this special guest you promised us? ",Modern
183936," Oh. All right then, you and me both. This is barmy. I was born in Chiswick. I've only ever had package holidays. Now I'm here. This is so. I mean it's. I don't know, it's all sort of. I don't even know what the word is. ",Modern
204271," Listen to me. If you go with him, I can't guarantee your safety. ",Modern
220823, Look at me. ,Modern
207074," Er, I don't know. He's certainly got the right demeanour. Capricious, brilliant. ",Modern
182449, Titanic. Who thought of the name? ,Modern
166017, Is that supposed to sound tough? ,Modern
190770, Aren't we all? ,Modern
211713, You will tell me everything this Doctor knows about Robin Hood and his Merry Men.,Modern
204912, You should have learned by now. ,Modern
233726," So, how are you holding up without a Tardis, or your friends or a hope? A fugitive in time? ",Modern
200519, Agreed. Let's faint. ,Modern
169608," It seems I have no choice.   Oh, do excuse me. Civic duties leave little time for a sandwich. ",Modern
204887," Outlier droid, monitoring everything. If I shut her down, I can. ",Modern
221837, You're kind of wet. ,Modern
220629, When?  ,Modern
236250, Will do. Gorgeous brain. ,Modern
207605, Tricky! ,Modern
204533," But they keep coming back, don't you see? Every time I negotiate, I try to understand. Well, not today. No. Today, I honour the victims first. His, the Master's, the Dalek's, all the people who died because of my mercy! ",Modern
177972, Was she car-jacked by two people? ,Modern
193251, Seal that door. Seal it now. ,Modern
192595, I'll be okay. ,Modern
181090," What matters is, we can communicate. We have got big problems now. They have taken the blue box, haven't they? The angels have the phone box. ",Modern
232340," That creature is a lie, and he debased you and your faith. Don't you see? You are the creators. Look what you can do. You build. But he made you destroyers. That's no God. I'm sorry. ",Modern
221652," Yes, yes, they are, see? ",Modern
187719, Do it now. ,Modern
234858, AJudoon warning transmission. The cheek. ,Modern
225627, Arms at the ready!,Modern
171633, Please. ,Modern
180120," Well, obviously. ",Modern
193692," Step into the light, my dear. That's it.   What say you, Francesco? Do you like her? ",Modern
202499, I work for the Silence. They would kill me. ,Modern
170352," Sir, I'm arresting you under Private Legislation Sixteen of the Game Station Syndicate. ",Modern
183833," Doctor, how many people died? ",Modern
173878," Oh, he loves his Gran, this one. Proper little mummy's boy all round. ",Modern
186781," That was quick, wasn't it, Mummy? ",Modern
186577, They won't attack until there's enough of them. But they've got our scent now. They're coming. ,Modern
230421, Our past is no more. We are no longer assassins. Now we are witnesses. ,Modern
231956," Oh, Grace.  ",Modern
221144," Look around you. The starship Harmony And Redemption, minimum ticket price one billion credits, plus the provable murder of multiple innocent life forms. Suites are reserved for planet-burners.  Thank you. Even the staff are required to have a verifiable history of indiscriminate slaughter. This is where genocide comes to kick back and relax. Do try the fish. ",Modern
214924," They're really, really scaring us? ",Modern
184891," Doctor, breathing your last? ",Modern
229613, Something's inside the shields. ,Modern
193809," Why is him being your brother weird, but with me, it's okay?   Actually, I thought you were her fianc�. ",Modern
229028," Look at your views. Never had a flat. I should get one, I'd be good in a flat. I could get a sofa. Imagine me with a sofa, like my own sofa, I could get a purple one and sit on it. Am I being weird? ",Modern
180864, Where are you going? ,Modern
233731, Did I ever apologise for that? ,Modern
227260, They are not escaping. ,Modern
219532, Keep trying.,Modern
183931, I could always take you home. ,Modern
208849, Exterminate! Exterminate. Exterminate! ,Modern
191437," How about it, Wilfred? ",Modern
193982," Amy, run.   This way, you freak. No! This way, you big, stupid, great SpongeBob. The only thing I've seen uglier than you is your Mum. ",Modern
177887," We're going out to Brooklyn. Everyone says the air's so much cleaner, and we couldn't stay in Pharmacy Town, because ",Modern
189709, With this. ,Modern
186880, There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could. ,Modern
202288, Kill it! ,Modern
184438," And this is where they make it, Doctor. Shipping worldwide. Seventeen factories across the globe, but this is the central depot, sending ATMOS to every country on Earth. ",Modern
227593, Tongue! Smart boy. Biology. What did she call you? Ryan? ,Modern
191207, Nine hundred years. We must look like insects to you. ,Modern
230174," Yes. For starters, Prem's a Hindu name. We're Muslim. And he doesn't look anything like the photos. It's not him. ",Modern
206937, Churchill? ,Modern
240746, Exterminate!,Modern
239280, It most certainly was not!,Modern
206770, And how would he know that? ,Modern
201547," And then you actually talk to them, and five minutes later they're as dull as a brick?",Modern
188968, I've got you. It's all right. ,Modern
223503," Aw, come on. Father at least, please. ",Modern
190978," But wait a minute. I mean, what about you? ",Modern
193908," I'll make you a deal. An answer for an answer. You're using a perception filter. It doesn't change your features, but manipulates the brainwaves of the person looking at you. But seeing one of you for the first time in, say, a mirror, the brain doesn't know what to fill the gap with, so leaves it blank, hence no reflection. ",Modern
212002, I promise never to look.,Modern
187651," And she's the voice. She stole it. Look at her. It's not possessing him, it's draining him. ",Modern
218874, At ease. I'm the President of the World. I'm here to rescue people and generally establish happiness all over the place. The Doctor. Doctor Funkenstein. ,Modern
185362, Isn't every soldier? ,Modern
209190," It's the same screwdriver. Same software, different case. ",Modern
188329, Soon the Crucible will be complete. We have waited long for this ultimate destiny. Now the Daleks are the masters of Earth. ,Modern
205239, What? ,Modern
208054," Smile! Say, Spacey Zoomer. ",Modern
211866, An exit.,Modern
215765, Don't you dare! Don't you think about it!,Modern
195192," Some sort of space-time cataclysm. An explosion, maybe. Big enough to put cracks in the universe. But what? ",Modern
167416, Just repeat it every time.   Big Ben - why did the Slitheen go and hit Big Ben? ,Modern
177127," You see, there are great tests to come, and terrible deeds. Some of them my own. But if I am to survive this, I need you. ",Modern
191931," Yeah, it's cool. Bow ties are cool. ",Modern
172993, You just said twenty four hours! ,Modern
224159, They're fixing the lock! ,Modern
177171, Just keep working. I'll go ask Mister Stoker. He might know.,Modern
176871, What the hell's it doing? ,Modern
166947, Of course it's me. ,Modern
197821, The he's hot when he's clever face. ,Modern
222018, That's very commendable. ,Modern
240243," But the Tardis is still deciphering the information. I'm sorry it's so painful, but we need you to hold on a little longer.  ",Modern
202116, But a teleport in a shop? That's ridiculous. ,Modern
172893, Must be. ,Modern
205219, Where are we? ,Modern
203578," Ah, yes, sorry. Guys, this is the Doctor and Amy.   Guys?   Oh, my god. ",Modern
171518," It was having a perfectly normal blood wash, and all of a sudden it started crying. It's this one. ",Modern
181849," Mister Saxon, we have Condition Red on the Jones plan. We're taking them in. All of them. ",Modern
170324," No, the correct answer is hats. ",Modern
186338," Er, I'm sorry, everyone. Er, this isn't going to be pleasant. She's ghosting. ",Modern
212755," Deep cover in my school? Why? Where's Atif, what have you done with him?",Modern
206976, Yeah. ,Modern
208333, What do we do? ,Modern
166394," Oh, come on. Everyone on this platform's worth zillions. ",Modern
191088, The Untempered Schism. That's when it began. ,Modern
226426, It's all right. They don't feel pain.  ,Modern
196717, Amy Pond. The girl who waited all night in your garden. Was it worth it? ,Modern
196958, Were you being ,Modern
175285, No!  TOM' ,Modern
219811," We have to get to Triton, destroy all the Morpheus machines. End this. This is how we get home? ",Modern

201007," No doorknob. Wooden pans, a massive glass eye, and now no doorknob. ",Modern
172039," Oh, but it's perfect. ",Modern
170875, Did more than that. Stopped World War Three with her. Harriet Jones. ,Modern
228218," You're Albarian, he said? ",Modern
217285," Please, please do, because I have been on my feet all day.     But before you get all exterminate-y, two things. One, I want to see Davros. Two, I have a lovely little gift for you all, if you take me to him right now.",Modern
203849, Stir. Min ate. ,Modern
224213, What do you mean? ,Modern
167960, The Daleks must survive! ,Modern
239461, Here is your transport.,Modern
226964," And probably a pig. Young lady, you're coming with me. No arguments. May I remind you I'm still empowered to kick your arse. ",Modern
203586," I died outside, and the cold preserved my body. I forgot about dying. ",Modern
173929, And now you're trapped in the television. ,Modern
193111," I can't, okay? I've tried and I can't. It's stone. ",Modern
191010,"   But we know his intention. He still possesses the Moment, and he'll use it to destroy Daleks and Time Lords alike. ",Modern
212373," Excuse me, sir. I regret to say that your guilt has been detected.",Modern
205043," Yes, I need a signal to lock on to. What did she say? Early what dynasty?",Modern
219757," You had that prepared well in advance, didn't you? Your statement. Your alibi. There would inevitably be questions when you got to Triton. So, you needed to get your story straight. ",Modern
185730, No policewomen in 1926. ,Modern
240033," Madam, who are you? And what are youdoing in my tunnels?  ",Modern
234820," I know. Man spends his entire life behind a bar, pivoting to the cafe trade ain't easy, but I try. For you, I'd try anything. ",Modern
224109," Look, for the record, I'm not prejudiced. I'm usually on the receiving end. ",Modern
207419, She'll die even quicker now! ,Modern
166622," Yeah, mate. Not now, thanks. Oi, you! Follow that hearse! ",Modern
196611," Is it? Well, here's the noise that sun is making right now.   That's my Tardis burning up. That's what's been keeping the Earth warm. ",Modern
215000," Danny, I'll never say those words again. Not to anybody else, ever. Those words, from me, are yours now.  So, er. That's a thing.   Okay, Danny? Er, there's more but that's kind of the headline. Okay, Danny, please speak to me, This is, this is killing me.  Danny, I love you. And you are the last person who's ever going to hear me say that.",Modern
197154," Nature. I am not alone, and I am at peace. ",Modern
185531, It's not what I'd call a temple. ,Modern
219987," Don't worry, we're perfectly safe.  ",Modern
214578," Well, of course it's supposed to be bigger. Most people are confused by that. ",Modern
175228," Sweet, maybe. Passionate, I suppose. But don't ever mistake that for nice. Do what you want. ",Modern
185211," Oh, I have missed all this, but, you know. I'm good here, back at home. And I'm better for having been away. Besides, someone needs me. Never mind the universe, I've got a great big world of my own now. ",Modern
168732," I've had all these extra hours. No one else in the world has ever had that. And on top of that, I got to see you. And you're beautiful. How lucky am I, eh? So, come on, do as your dad says. You going to be there for me, love? Thanks for saving me. ",Modern
221740, Oh! Did something happen? ,Modern
167332," And there's still no word from inside Downing Street, though we are getting even more new arrivals. That's group Captain Tennant James of the RAF, though why he's been summoned we've no idea. And that's Ewan McAllister, Deputy Secretary for the Scottish Parliament. And this is most unusual. I'm told that is Sylvia Dillane, Chairman of the North Sea Boating Club. Quite what connects these people, we have no idea. ",Modern
172290," I'm no dinner lady. And I don't often say that.   Here we go. Come on, boy. Here we go. ",Modern
210204, The government?,Modern
220238, Hi. What can I get you?  ,Modern
236527, Doc. ,Modern
169026, What happened? ,Modern
217287," Clara Oswald. I brought you complete control of the Doctor, gift-wrapped. Better. Canned. ",Modern
222572," I do. Come here, Bill.",Modern
213335," It's killed him. It's coming in here! Doctor, it's coming in here!  ",Modern
194988, Don't do this!,Modern
241119, So where are we going to exactly? ,Modern
210206," It's a dinosaur, Alf. A real dinosaur.",Modern
188742, You told me nothing could get through those doors. ,Modern
187866," Honestly, you two. There's aliens on the news. They took that hospital all the way to the moon, and you're banging on about raffle tickets. ",Modern
167394, Then we can phone for help. You must have contacts. ,Modern
180386, The maid was definitely hiding something. A secret around this Mister Smith. ,Modern
170969, Sometimes. ,Modern
190323, Gadget gadget. ,Modern
211353,Me?,Modern
179704, No! The Beatles! ,Modern
182703," Thing is, how are Mister and Mrs Fatso going to get through that gap? ",Modern
239399," Look.  Gerald... Oh, what's going on?",Modern
225706," No, I didn't sacrifice him. I executed him. ",Modern
169718, Boyfriend? ,Modern
189313, The perfect escape. Do you ever wonder what you're escaping from? ,Modern
173284, And how do you know that? ,Modern
169852, That'd be nice. ,Modern
202773, But it could activate any second. ,Modern
168363," Well, now, there's an interesting point. Is a slave a slave if he doesn't know he's enslaved? ",Modern
180195," Just you wait. One more month and I'm as free as the wind. I wish you could come with me, Jenny. You'd love it. ",Modern
231449," Oh, mate, seriously? Not witches. Bodies possessed by alien mud. Come on! ",Modern
231379, Okay.,Modern
227870, Oi! Karl from the train. Up and over! Up and over! ,Modern
222914," So, what will happen when the new people meet the robots?   That's the boy. The first to wake up. Where did you get this? ",Modern
201181, Dad! ,Modern
199767, I'm fine.,Modern
171539, You're right. Well done. ,Modern
216586, Why? Did something happen? ,Modern
195017, What? ,Modern
211226, Fire!,Modern
241168, Yeah. ,Modern
197614, Someone who trusts you more than anybody else in the universe. ,Modern
178125," Eight minutes, maximum.",Modern
218045, Have you still got the eye-patch thing?  ,Modern
182561, Something like that. ,Modern
180660," I must go to them, before anyone else dies. ",Modern
173932," Yes, Tommy. It feeds off the electrical activity of the brain, but it gorges itself like a great overfed pig, taking people's faces, their essences. It stuffs itself. ",Modern
210734, You'd better get that. It might be your boyfriend.,Modern
200742," The first question. The oldest question in the universe, hidden in plain sight. ",Modern
228334, What happened in here? ,Modern
171332, That way? ,Modern
179515," He cut it a bit fine there, didn't he? ",Modern
191600, There's a perception filter all round the door. Sensed it the last time I was here. Should've seen it. ,Modern
196839," Sorry, you two. Shouldn't have slipped away. Bit busy, you know?  RORY; You just saved the whole of space and time? Take the evening off. Maybe a bit of tomorrow.   Space and time isn't safe yet. The Tardis exploded for a reason. Something drew the Tardis to this particular date, and blew it up. Why? And why now?   The Silence, whatever it is, is still out there, and I have to. Excuse me a moment.   Hello? Oh, hello. I'm sorry, this is a very bad line. No, no, no, but that's not possible. She was sealed into the seventh Obelisk. I was at the prayer meeting. Well, no, I get that it's important. An Egyptian goddess loose on the Orient Express, in space. Give us a mo.   Sorry, something's come up. This will have to be goodbye. ",Modern
224064, You die quicker. ,Modern
167217, Like it said on the news. They're gathering experts in alien knowledge. And who's the biggest expert of the lot? ,Modern
188001, Show me your back! ,Modern
200577," Of course I noticed.   As soon as I knew you were coming, I tidied up a bit. ",Modern
241248, Shh. She knows what she's doing. ,Modern
168554," There's no Dave, no Sunita, no Bea. ",Modern
232066, Okay. ,Modern
210701, And I'm hoping you are too. This is over. Are you capable of admitting that?,Modern
187798, I'm turning. ,Modern
177250, I am not. ,Modern
207362, Not so much. ,Modern
195389, He's gone. ,Modern
218833, That's the Zygon High Command. It's Jemima and Claudette.ZYGON  violated. We demand the right to be ourselves. Normalise. Normalise! ,Modern
193661," Well, yes, natural. I think sometimes. Well, lots of times. ",Modern
236030, No. ,Modern
180117," Though we've known each other all of two months, you could even say Joan. ",Modern
181610, You are not alone. ,Modern
237925," Yeah, but, look... I mean, this... You'll be black and blue. ",Modern
206636, Viva Las Vegas! ,Modern
211330," Yes, good. Very good. Good work. You passed the test.",Modern
214198," Yeah, well, I think he could still be useful. ",Modern
233842," Oh Ada, you don't need a preview. You'll figure it out before anyone. The first to see the potential in things like that,  to work out what could be. What they can really do. Computers start with you. Sweet dreams, Ada Lovelace. ",Modern
168158," If it all goes through her, she must be a genius. ",Modern
185058, There's a Sonterun. Sontaran. ,Modern
193464, What could scare those things? ,Modern
221874, You will? ,Modern
183683," Evelina, I'm sorry, but you've got to hear me out. ",Modern
191553, People always say that. ,Modern
169310, Used the emergency teleport. Sorry I couldn't take you. ,Modern
203444, You have to sign these. ,Modern
180370," They've found us, and I've seen them. They look like people, like us, like normal. I'm sorry, but you've got to open the watch. Where is it?   Oh, my God. Where's it gone? Where's the watch? ",Modern
171677, But you're not going to   What do you think you're doing? ,Modern
212730," Morning, Mister Pink.",Modern
180986," The same way we did. The touch of an angel. Same one, probably, since you ended up in the same year. No, no. No, no, no, don't get up. Time travel without a capsule. Nasty. Catch your breath. Don't go swimming for half an hour. ",Modern
191824, Hang on! ,Modern
173961," Wait, wait, wait! Where do you think ",Modern
212855," Oh, I see.",Modern
180207," Oh, that's beautiful. ",Modern
200703," Oh, you should always waste time when you don't have any. Time is not the boss of you. Rule four hundred and eight. Amelia Pond, judgment death machine. Why am I not surprised? Sonic cane. ",Modern
167127, Huh? ,Modern
195357, I've come to accept the only person who's going to love my paintings is me. ,Modern
173519," I've been captured, but don't worry, Rose and Pete are still out there. They can rescue me. Oh well, never mind. You okay? ",Modern
240338, Exactly. The Sontarans are planning to use their enemies' entire armies in order to absorb the Flux.  ,Modern
193652," Hmm. You really are an alien, aren't you. ",Modern
169407, What's your mother's name? ,Modern

237707, They're built from the original Reconnaissance Dalek. I'm going to give them what they wanted in the first place. ,Modern
174459, How many of them? ,Modern
233568, No! ,Modern
238923, Yes. Sorry. ,Modern
220114," There are easier ways to steal a key, you know.  ",Modern
169284, I didn't. I knew you'd come back for us.   Found that old thing in the junk. Thinks he can write now ,Modern
171398, Commence stage one disinfection. ,Modern
191720, The human residence will be incinerated. Repeat. ,Modern
180450," Mister Smith, I think you should escort your lady friend to safety, don't you?",Modern
225521," You know what Friday is, then? ",Modern
182565, West zero by north two.,Modern
241045, Ow! Ow. Get off! Argh! Ah!   Hijacked jewellery. What's that about? Unless...,Modern
187447," What, you wanted this to happen? ",Modern
181178," Good to meet you, Sally Sparrow. ",Modern
217149," Yes, you can. Yes, you can.",Modern
206132," What is going on? Is this real? Please, tell me what is happening! ",Modern
203151," We can do a scan for life forms. We can detect people, even though they're far away. ",Modern
168074, He left you down there. ,Modern
171444, So they don't know you're here? ,Modern
225599, And you! Female. What do you say? ,Modern
187961, What about the bathroom? ,Modern
237904," Doc. Thank you so much. Right. Well, come on, son. ",Modern
174415," Officer, as Commander of Security, I order you to stand down and be confined. Immediately! ",Modern
180284," As you were, Mister Smith. ",Modern
174070, That's not my department. ,Modern
197742, Not so thanks. ,Modern
191268, But now they can see us. ,Modern
177149, Do what they say. All they want is to shine this light thing. It's all right. They're not going to hurt us. Just listen to them. ,Modern
219950, I also gave him enough time to return home and say goodbye to his family.  ,Modern
210302,"Ah! Morning, Miss Clara. You're awake at last.",Modern
235123," Not like you, in the heart of the city, talking to people all day long. ",Modern
174511," Oh. Oh, in a second, but then again, that is so human. Where angels fear to tread. Even now, standing on the edge. It's that feeling you get, eh? Right at the back of your head. That impulse. That strange little impulse. That mad little voice saying, go on. Go on. Go on. Go over. Go on. Maybe it's relying on that. For once in my life, Officer Scott, I'm going to say retreat. Oh, now I know I'm getting old. Rose, we're coming back.",Modern
194151, Yeah. Put on a jumper. That's what I always do. ,Modern
224701," Well, consider this a warning on the eve of war. I am the Doctor. I am what stands between you and them. ",Modern
190662, The end of time itself. ,Modern
200246," Of course not. But you gave them one hell of a start, and they've been working very hard ever since. ",Modern
218053, Odin! Odin!  ,Modern
188375," You're our only hope of finding the Doctor. But failing that, if no help is coming, then with the power invested in me by the Unified Intelligence Taskforce, I authorise you to take this. The Osterhagen Key. ",Modern

199498," Oh, so you were there when he was born, were you? ",Modern
172162, You could've done. ,Modern

181634, Let me in. Let me in! ,Modern
233381, There he is. ,Modern
235699, Just when I thought things couldn't get any madder. Whoa. ,Modern
225576, That was unwise. ,Modern
166798, It's all true. ,Modern
199409," That's it. Good, you remember. This is early Flesh. The early stages of the technology. So much to learn. ",Modern
179645," Rising body temperature, unusual energy readings. Stasis chamber. I do love a good stasis chamber. Keep him sedated in there. Regulate the body temperature. And, just for fun, run a bioscan and tissue profile on a metabolic detail. ",Modern
202632, The Government has again apologised for extensive radio interference caused by solar flare and sun spot activity. ,Modern
184319," It's better that way. People who know for certain tend to be like Mister Halpen.   Oh!   That's better. And now, Sigma, would you allow me the honour? ",Modern
225766, Doc-tor! Doc-tor! Doc-tor! Doc-tor! ,Modern
239532, Leave her first.,Modern
183645, Different sort of hypocaust? ,Modern
167086," This is the greatest crisis in modern history and you've done nothing. Your behaviour has been shameful, sir. You're supposed to be in charge. We need positive leadership. The capital's ground to a halt.   Furthermore, we can only assume that the Prime Minister's disappearance is the direct result of hostile alien action, and what have you been doing? Nothing. ",Modern
220328," Do you know what they did to me? A confession dial is a ritual act of  purification. It allows a dying Time Lord to face his demons and make  his peace, before his mind is uploaded to the Matrix. It was never intended as a  torture chamber for the living.  ",Modern
214992," Oh, Danny, everything is ",Modern
224111," What, you really don't know? ",Modern
211201," Every memory recorded. Some suppressed, but all still intact. We need to show the Dalek that star being born again. Recreate that moment. You need to get up there, find that moment and reawaken it.",Modern
199547," Rory, come on. ",Modern
180615, Come on! ,Modern
239013," To save you and that lad on Atropos - who I've not even met yet - from being overwhelmed by Time, I took it upon myself to jump into one of the burned out Mouris' place, to divert you from having to absorb the Time Force. ",Modern
209147," I'm not sure there's enough power for a two-way trip. In any event, we don't have the activation code. The Doctor knows we have this, so he's always kept the code from us. Let's hope he changes his mind.   Yes? Well, if you've found it, photograph it and send it to my phone. ",Modern
199341, What the hell happened? ,Modern
235345, What are you doing? ,Modern
229364," Okay, all right, you're right. That's why I came here. Apparently JLR was a little overzealous in cutting corners and worried about  keeping the bottom line instead of doing the right thing. But I just sign the contracts, okay? I expect other people to do their jobs. This is not on me. ",Modern
190649," You should not have delayed, for the lines of convergence are being drawn across the Earth. Even now, the king is in his Counting house. ",Modern

240163, What?  ,Modern
166167," Can we keep the domestics outside, thank you?   Am I addressing the Consciousness? Thank you. If I might observe, you infiltrated this civilisation by means of warp shunt technology. So, may I suggest, with the greatest respect, that you shunt off?   Oh, don't give me that. It's an invasion, plain and simple. Don't talk about constitutional rights. I am talking! This planet is just starting. These stupid little people have only just learnt how to walk, but they're capable of so much more. I'm asking you on their behalf. Please, just go. ",Modern
192086," I don't know. There's a darkness at the heart of this nation. It threatens every one of us. Help us, Doctor. You're our only hope. Your friend is safe. This will take you to her. Now go, quickly! ",Modern
240447, You risked your life. You got the information that we needed.  ,Modern
200401, Am I getting warm? ,Modern
214756, Not everything can be fixed with a screwdriver. It's not a magic wand.,Modern
181770, Dead lady. ,Modern
177413," That's amazing! Just amazing. It's worth putting up with the smell. And those are men dressed as women, yeah? ",Modern
207373, We found you drifting. ,Modern
219589, You're kidding.,Modern
208981," As you can see, all the paintings are landscapes. No figures of any kind. ",Modern

235542," Okay, so let's get out of here. ",Modern
229871," It's pretty old school, this one. ",Modern
236392, This place keeps on changing like a puzzle. ,Modern
176391, What is it? ,Modern

218013," Okay, so, why are you staring?  ",Modern
236126, I'm not listening to you. ,Modern
198567," So, you mean ",Modern
203032, Have you seen the way I dress? ,Modern
236406," I've never believed in such things, but could this be Hell? Could we be deceased? ",Modern

The day you                   were born, the day you die. The day you fall in love,                   the day that love ends. A whole city built from                   triumph and heartbreak and boredom and laughter and                   cutting your toenails. It's the best place you will                   ever be.",Modern

229801, But we can't evacuate. ,Modern
229879," Ah. Pting presence denied, strike two. One left. Now, you two. See? A more direct route. Obviously, fast-moving asteroids  and debris to avoid on the way, which is presumably why the systems wanted to avoid it. Now, if I can rig up a cover signal back to Resus One... ",Modern

226388, We tried to reverse out of it. ,Modern
228653," Evening. She was coming home from work. I remember cos she said people thought she didn't stand cos she was tired from working, but she wasn't. ",Modern
190174," As long as they leave us alone, that's fine with me. Oh, you beauties. Look at this. ",Modern
193064, And they're not fast. You said they were fast. They should have had us by now. ,Modern
206790, It isn't what you deserve. ,Modern
169040, Nothing. Why I was asking. What do you know? ,Modern
189543," Hello, I'm the Doctor. Happy Easter. ",Modern

183952," Mister Halpen, sir. Doctor Ryder, new head of Ood Management. ",Modern

240855," Oi, you. No dissing my mate. That's my job. ",Modern
226195, Everything else is cradle-snatching. ,Modern
190090," They'll start again. Generate a new doorway. It's not their fault, it's their natural life cycle. But I'll see if I can nudge the wormholes on to uninhabited planets. Closer to home, Captain. Those two lads. Very good in a crisis. Nathan needs a job, Barclay's good with engines. You could do a lot worse. Privates Nathan and Barclay, UNIT's finest. ",Modern
178495," I'm not a fool, Doctor. ",Modern
178554, You're on my tail. Get off my tail!,Modern

222713," I'm not that fond of fish, except socially, which can complicate a meal like this. ",Modern
224376, Stop talking. Now.  ,Modern

178483, Tallulah. ,Modern
233525, Nations shall cower in fear as my steam gun fires one thousand bearings per minute. ,Modern
227690, She's got two separate pulses. ,Modern
171143," Tea. Like we're having a picnic while the world comes to an end. Very British. How does this thing work? If it picks up TV, maybe we could see what's going on out there. Maybe we've surrendered. What do you do to it? ",Modern
240431," Now, that's the question. Do you have any idea what I've been through because of you?  ",Modern

215706, I am so sorry.,Modern
216591, He and I've known each other a long time. ,Modern
172557," Now, let's think. If you were a thing that ticked and you were hiding in someone's bedroom, first thing you do, break the clock. No one notices the sound of one clock ticking, but two? You might start to wonder if you're really alone. Stay on the bed. Right in the middle. Don't put your hands or feet over the edge.   Reinette   Don't look round.   You, stay exactly where you are. Hold still, let me look.   You've been scanning her brain. What, you've crossed two galaxies and thousands of years just to scan a child's brain? What could there be in a little girl's mind worth blowing a hole in the universe? ",Modern
205561," Don't be clever, Strax. It doesn't suit you. ",Modern
168904," Mummy? Let me in please, mummy. Please let me in. ",Modern

200316, You helped my friends. Thank you. ,Modern
174093," And yet here we are, beyond the laws of physics. Welcome on board.",Modern
230534, This is a terrible design. Was it a good wedding at least? ,Modern
197124," I could take her back up there, but she'd never survive the trip. We need a fully functioning life-support.",Modern
237971, The cataclysmic. The impossible. ,Modern
203411, Do you recognise where you are? ,Modern
183397," No, it's just. It's a funny old life, in the Tardis. ",Modern
169927," I promise you I've changed since we last met, Doctor. There was this girl, just today. A young thing, something of a danger. She was getting too close. I felt the blood lust rising, just as the family taught me, I was going to kill her without a thought. And then I stopped. She's alive somewhere right now. She's walking around this city because I can change. I did change. I know I can't prove it ",Modern
230437, We can show you. ,Modern
224894, Doctor? ,Modern
201820, What exactly happened to him? ,Modern
187061, Towards us. ,Modern
201493, Time's up. Handbots coming. ,Modern
170718, Stop it! Just stop it! ,Modern

183660, Look you. ,Modern
226944," Right then. Come on, you lot. Everybody down to the cellar. ",Modern
209933," I'm not interested in changing history, Doctor. I want to change the future. The Daleks send for reinforcements daily. They are massing for war. Three days ago, they attacked the Mainframe itself. ",Modern
186241, Meh. ,Modern
217280, You are not a good doctor.  Pity. I had hoped to see the sun one last time with the eyes of my true self.,Modern
238035, No. ,Modern
205988, Could you just ask me that question again? ,Modern
193516, You're dead if I leave you. ,Modern
202274, Oh.,Modern
224531," Cardinal Angelo, someone just broke into your book cage. ",Modern
223789, What? ,Modern
173119, Thank you very much! ,Modern
180558," Well, it lies on the River Leen, its southern boundary following the course of the River Trent which flows from Stoke to the Humber. ",Modern
240164, It will be beautiful.  ,Modern
170890," Oh, that's the thing, isn't it? You can rely on me. I don't go changing my face. ",Modern
182038, Is this what I think it is? ,Modern
209284, We don't need to land. ,Modern
235588," He knew what he was taking on with me. I don't do emotions. And I'm really not good at sticking with things, you know? Commitment.  Also, I really don't like foreign travel. ",Modern
227307," That creature, it looked familiar. ",Modern
237585," How many people in the universe get to meet the Doctor, let alone travel with her? We're the lucky ones, Yaz. Enjoy the journey while you're on it.  Cos the joy... is worth the pain.   Locked door. ",Modern
181026, Of course. Why? ,Modern
196908, Tamed the sky? What does that mean? ,Modern
206170, People always have plans. ,Modern
198180," Yeah, Doctor, I get it. I know. ",Modern
166891, It's working. ,Modern
239887, I cannot hear it.  ,Modern
209969, What is? ,Modern
187052," Did you just? No, sorry, it's nothing. ",Modern
180436, Time Lord. ,Modern
203760," Sorry, what? ",Modern
217490, Cass is saying   ,Modern
206045," Oh no, you don't.",Modern
232191, What about where you're from? ,Modern
185100," Nah, you and me, Martha Jones. Just like old times.   Alien technology, this-a way. ",Modern
223919, What's that? ,Modern
202649, Mmm. ,Modern
229319," I eat danger for breakfast. I don't, I prefer cereal. Or croissants. Or those little fried Portuguese... Never mind, it's not important. ",Modern
234199, Me? Now I'm no one. I was my dad's carer. ,Modern
167755," Goddard, inform the Cage we're heading down. You, English. Look after the girl. Go and canoodle or spoon or whatever it is you British do. And you, Doctor with no name, come and see my pet.",Modern
214116, No. Not impressive. Annoying. ,Modern
219975, It's him! He's back! ,Modern
239625, No way. Thank you.,Modern
216884," You want to know how dangerous I am? Davros sent you. You know how stupid you are? Huh! You came!  Is that supposed to frighten me? Snake nest in a dress? Now, explain, politely. Davros is my arch-enemy. Why would I want to talk to him?",Modern
229175, Did Anna have access to your experiments? ,Modern
194590, And you've only got the one drill? ,Modern
215064, Time can be rewritten.,Modern
233681,What? ,Modern
201383, Temporal engines. Somewhere to hide. ,Modern
226143," No, we were both wrong about that. ",Modern
177537," It was the shape Peter Streete thought best, that's all. Said it carried the sound well. ",Modern
212986," Oh, genius. That is, that is really, really brilliant reasoning. How can you think that I'm her dad when we both look exactly the same age?",Modern
193725, What do you want? ,Modern
178589," It's called a Dalek. And it's not just metal, it's alive. ",Modern
211842, Okay. Good. Good wells.,Modern
216151, What am I looking at? ,Modern
196631, Exterminate! ,Modern
231317, In the air and in the earth... ,Modern
205039," Ah. Early Qin dynasty, I'd say. ",Modern
193943, And repopulate it with the girls she's transformed. ,Modern
168226, What is that? ,Modern
183263, Deadlock the building.,Modern
177034, Quite. ,Modern
178226," It's been quite a while since I saw you, Martha Jones. ",Modern
208213, And I forbid you to do that. ,Modern
201420," In fact, I think I can now definitely say I hate him. I hate The Doctor. I hate him more than I've ever hated anyone ",Modern
231812," Because there are bears. No monster, but the occasional bear. Look, thanks for coming. I'll go back soon, but you can go now. ",Modern
236727, Get inside!,Modern
219253," Doctor, I think they're Zygons. ",Modern
231830, She got here when you did.,Modern
213572, It wasn't my decision to make. I told you.,Modern
237981," No. So, we still on for Halloween drinks tonight?  ",Modern
173891, How dare you! Do you think I fought a war just so a mouthy little scum like you could call me a coward? ,Modern
221519," Expected? Argh!   Sorry, did you say I was expected? ",Modern
191690," Repeat, Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the human residence will be incinerated. ",Modern
205527, No. ,Modern
221302, River. ,Modern
222536, Heather. ,Modern
189655, This isn't exactly helping. ,Modern
169512, I don't know. ,Modern
166754," All the time, sir. Every night, voices in my head. ",Modern
223870," Oh, here he comes. ",Modern
170079,   Default. ,Modern
230879, No. ,Modern
236849, I'm going to take a look. ,Modern
239067, Prepare to convert organic life forms. ,Modern
184225," Canisters primed, sir. As soon as the core heats up, the gas is released. Give it two hundred marks and counting. ",Modern
208509," Okay, what then? ",Modern
209188, Is something funny? Did I miss a funny thing? ,Modern
213910," Of course it is. That's why we're here. To study our own demise. So let's get to work. Come on. Chop, chop.  Clara Oswald.",Modern
215556," Stories. Stories. Stories. I made them up. Look, ask anybody who knows me. I am an incredible liar. ",Modern
203800," Oswin, get this door open. ",Modern
205976," It's just a thing to remember the password, run you clever boy and remember. Hang on. ",Modern
222645, That's not even funny. ,Modern
183149," Well, thanks for your help. Tell you what, maybe you could lay off the pills for a week or so.   Oh. Got to go. Sorry.",Modern
223511,   Do you want a hand?  ,Modern
205560, Sherlock Holmes. ,Modern
214494," Yeah, it's out of service, but you'd need someone to hold the dead man's handle. Won't run without it. Is this official? Because I've always wanted to ram something. ",Modern
227029," But the Doctor, we can't just leave him. ",Modern
208055," Look at us, Doctor. We're flying! ",Modern
197575, So? ,Modern
170451, Two hundred ships. More than two thousand on board each one. That's just about half a million of them. ,Modern
189267," Oh, I was just protecting you. ",Modern
228321, Nope. Come on.  ,Modern
211518,I had the situation well in hand.,Modern
193026, What's wrong? ,Modern
192026, Are you going to tell her? ,Modern
213167, Do it now!  ,Modern
166906, She didn't make it. ,Modern
211970," Hello?  Who's this? This is a friend of yours playing a game. Playing a trick, are you, hey? A little trick on Rupert here?  Okay. It's not funny this, you know.",Modern
181576, Yes! ,Modern
175122," I don't care about step five. Because it's all gone wrong, Mister Kennedy, ever since you turned up. We used to come here every week, and we'd have a laugh. We were friends. No wonder they stopped coming. I mean, there's no Bliss any more, and even Bridget, she hasn't turned up. ",Modern
182732, What's going on up there? ,Modern
170573," Right, now there's four of us. ",Modern
226795, No. It's an actual tear. But it shouldn't be. ,Modern
182434," Nice and steady. Good work, Mister Cavill. And maintain position. Now then, gentlemen, according to the traditions of the planet below, Christmas is a time of celebration. I think you might be entitled to a tot of rum. Just the one. Off you go. I'll keep watch. ",Modern
217689," Wait, you're not suggesting that? But we're safe now. The ghosts are in the cage. We can get out of here.",Modern
187564, They're separating. ,Modern
196090," It's about the Doctor, Ma'am. You met him once, didn't you? I know he came here. ",Modern
209911, Confess. ,Modern
174418, I don't know what you mean. ,Modern
183545, I told you to get rid of it. ,Modern
187483, You've been looking down on us from the moment we walked in.,Modern
203714," The universe has ever seen. But you know what really gets me about you, Oswin? The soufflés. Where do you get milk ",Modern
204438, Did you try to repair your craft? Surely someone with your skills ,Modern
187583, Help me. ,Modern
193572," Because, Amy, this is important. ",Modern
208176, Stop rummaging in my mind. ,Modern
217877," No!   However that sentence ends, no, we can't. Save him, and you'll want to save O'Donnell. You can't cheat time. I just tried. You can't just go back and cut off tragedy at the root. Because you find yourself talking to someone you just saw dead on a slab. Because then you really do see ghosts. We don't tell him. Understand? Not a word. We don't have that right. ",Modern
184298," I think hair loss is the least of my problems right now, thanks. ",Modern
209922," It can't end, either.",Modern
168249," So, what do you think's going on? ",Modern
224483, Everyone knows that.,Modern
181431," Oh, those damned galaxies. They had to go and collapse. Some admiration would have been nice. Yes, just a little, just once. ",Modern
188686, Exterminate. Exterminate. ,Modern
209901," Yeah, well, the sun's gone down. ",Modern
206051, Can you stop this? ,Modern
216030," Yeah, well, at least it's unsuitable for children under four. Parts small enough to swallow, so watch out. ",Modern
235812, Of course it is. I told you to tell them. I told the doctors. I told all of you. They're real. ,Modern
187947," Don't get all chippy with me, Vera Duckworth. Pop your clogs on and go and feed whippets. ",Modern
208319," Move one, turn on sonic screwdriver. Move two, activate pulser. Move three, amplify pulser. See you. ",Modern
211942, Everybody does that.,Modern
181622," Chan Professor, please ",Modern
234943, Who is this? What's going on? Where am I? And where are you? ,Modern
188438, It's a paint gun. ,Modern
178286, Where are we? ,Modern
223126, I'm your teacher.  Telling you things is what I do. ,Modern
166343," Bundle of laughs, you are.   That's not supposed to happen.",Modern
221752, You're not looking at anyone. Are you shy now? Is that floor really  interesting? ,Modern
198224, Rome fell. ,Modern
187686, I will. You watch me. I'm going to throw him out. ,Modern
186000, My son. Can it be? ,Modern
184600," Hold up, I thought that was my job. ",Modern
208415," My mum's soufflé, yeah. Although this time I'll get it right. This time I will be Soufflé Girl. ",Modern
220255, Lord President?  ,Modern
179755, Burn with me. ,Modern
225848, I've got to get back to the others. ,Modern

220112," Mum! Mum, are you okay? ",Modern
192077,DOCTOR; Can't be. ,Modern
188995," Donna, you can't even change a plug. ",Modern
199371," No, bequeathed. You gave them this. You poured in your personalities, emotions, traits, memories, secrets, everything. You gave them your lives. Human lives are amazing. Are you surprised they walked off with them? ",Modern
168034," I've got to do this. I've got to end it. The Daleks destroyed my home, my people. I've got nothing left. ",Modern
169092," Nine centuries in, I'm coping. Where've you been? We're in the middle of a London Blitz. It's not a good time for a stroll. ",Modern
236311, Anything else strange happen since you've been here? ,Modern
208128," Right, right, well, okay. As Imperial Consul, I'm putting Clara in charge.   Clara, stay alive until I get back, and don't let anyone blow up this planet. ",Modern
228703, Yeah. ,Modern
198460, I give the orders. ,Modern
171199, But you can't be. ,Modern

176811, How did you meet him? ,Modern
222121, Shock absorber.,Modern
175426," How're you doing, Chloe Webber? ",Modern
189246, I wonder. I can't help noticing you're wearing a fob watch. ,Modern
190423," You were right, Doctor. ",Modern
177001," Hardly early onset, if you'll forgive me, Miss Finnegan. Any more ideas? Swales?",Modern
209061," Still, loving the posh gravelly thing. It's very convincing.",Modern

Have you given it any consideration? Because you're very close to getting what you want. What's it going to be like? Paint me a picture. Are you going to live in houses? Do you want people to go to work? Will there be holidays? Oh! Will there be music? Do you think people will be allowed to play violins? Who's going to make the violins? Well? Oh, you don't actually know, do you? Because, like every other tantrumming child in history, Bonnie, you don't actually know what you want.

When you've killed all the bad guys, and when it's all perfect and just and fair, when you have finally got it exactly the way you want it, what are you going to do with the people like you?

225358," She said it's me. I asked the Monks for help and started all of this, so I have to be the one to finish it.  The only downside is, if that's what we do, well, it's not worth me starting any long books. ",Modern

200407, It was late. I took a bus. ,Modern

203328, I imagine you'd prefer to be alone. ,Modern
240838, You saved him. ,Modern
176242," That's your problem. I'm protecting this world, and this world only. ",Modern
173962," Oh! I'm very sorry, sir. Shouldn't you be at the Coronation? ",Modern
224887," Hello. Privyet. Sorry about that. Needed the call to zero in on your co-ordinates. Now, this is the Secretary-General of the UN.  I am the President of the world. And this is Xiaolian, she's in charge of the Chinese army. Say hi to each other. Now, we've been having a bit of chat. The thing is, World War Three. What do you think? Basically, we're against it.",Modern
202848, Hey. What? ,Modern
185984," No. But she wrote. She wrote those brilliant, clever books. And who's her greatest admirer?  The Moving Finger points at you, Lady Eddison. ",Modern
223976, His what? ,Modern
190851, Merry Christmas. ,Modern
234734," Shield's working, then. Come on. Come on!  ",Modern
216816, It will only open when he's dead.,Modern
236481, I'll find it and remove it. ,Modern
231008, We need to find the Doctor.,Modern
179354, No! Get away from her! ,Modern
184554, I said no salutes. ,Modern
241265, Geronimo! ,Modern
168111," Go and find out. Stop nagging me. The thing is, Adam, time travel's like visiting Paris. You can't just read the guide book, you've got to throw yourself in. Eat the food, use the wrong verbs, get charged double and end up kissing complete strangers. Or is that just me? Stop asking questions, go and do it. Off you go, then. Your first date. ",Modern
212574, It's not that bad a day. And you're being very slow.,Modern
206071," I was scared, really scared. Didn't know where I was. ",Modern
223182, Where are we going? ,Modern
197030, Nobody comes. Get out! Get out of my house! ,Modern
219182, Give it to me now. ,Modern
234492, I believe this is operating on a similar principle. If we could just work out its purpose...  ,Modern
192334, Follow me.,Modern
208808, That probably sounded better in his head. ,Modern
193542, Really what? Hello? Really what? Hello? Hello? Hello? Please say you're there. Hello? Hello? ,Modern
225632," Show them!   The mark of a rope. While you were fighting for Queen and country, the Colonel here was dancing the Newgate polka.  This burn, this is the mark of the rope that failed to hang him for desertion. They tried to hang him, but they bungled it.  He's a paper tiger. Not fit to command. ",Modern
200706," Rule twenty seven. You might want to write these down. Oh, it's a robot. ",Modern
234729," Come on, run!    Run! ",Modern
173992," Hope so. Just to be on the safe side though, I'll use my unrivalled knowledge of transtemporal extirpation methods to neutralise the residual electronic pattern. ",Modern
217972, It's halfway up my leg.  ,Modern
209003," Oh, busy. I see. Is that what we're calling it, eh? Eh?   Hello, ladies. ",Modern
182951, Who's there? ,Modern
215954, For whom? ,Modern
176266, What's polycarbite? ,Modern
186942," Just the headphones, please. ",Modern
170492, You did it.   Feels like I haven't seem you in years. ,Modern
208764," Look, my name, my real name, that is not the point. The name I chose is the Doctor. The name you choose, it's like, it's like a promise you make. He's the one who broke the promise.   Clara? Clara? Clara!   He is my secret. ",Modern
205349, Because there's not a single thing you can do to stop it. ,Modern
202746, I don't want to murder you. ,Modern
173549," Oh, yes. ",Modern
221571, Can I? ,Modern
201218," Excuses, excuses. ",Modern
235807, Time to go back in your room. It'll be dark soon. ,Modern
197849, Apparently. ,Modern
235381, This is the hospital the ambulance brought her to. ,Modern
196055," What, you're trying to sneak off? ",Modern
218745," Ah, there is nowhere new under the sun. Above it, on the other hand.   I've missed you, Clara Oswald. ",Modern
219332," Because I want to get you to see, and I'm almost there! ",Modern
190742, Yeah. Afternoon.,Modern
240758, Right. I guess that's a valid approach. ,Modern
228166, A couple? I've got a book full. But shouldn't we keep up with those two before they get too far away? ,Modern
174072, Oxygen holding. Internal gravity fifty six point six. We should be okay. ,Modern
226725," Oh, tedious. ",Modern
173959, There! ,Modern
181685," Sir. If you don't mind me asking. I'm sorry, but it's all a bit new. What exactly do you want me to do? ",Modern
188296, I've been promoted. Medical Director on Project Indigo. ,Modern
167084, I've got the White House phoning me direct because Downing Street won't answer their calls. This is outrageous! We haven't even started the vaccination programme. This is appalling. The nations of the world are watching the United Kingdom. ,Modern
226769," They consider themselves to be an improvement, an upgrade. ",Modern
227225," She wasn't anyone.   She's a computer-generated interface, connected to a multiform, inter-phasing data-bank. ",Modern
223062," Best fish pies on the ice.  Try your luck, ladies and gentlemen! Toss for a pie! ",Modern
232913, Ryan!,Modern
175172," I'm here, Bridget. It's all right. I'm close. ",Modern
201301, Time moves faster on Amy's side of the glass.,Modern
231579, Those panels look more like barricades than repairs. Looks like it's been abandoned. ,Modern
174834," We're not out of it yet. We're still the first people in history to fly away from a black hole. Toby, read me the stats. ",Modern
224065," Yeah, the scareder you are, the faster you suffocate. So, relax or die. Sorry, probably not the most helpful thought. So, breathe in, breathe out. ",Modern
190613," That's for me to decide. Now, you'd better get home. Oh, it's all locked up. You've been away. Still, that's easy.   All yours. ",Modern
228924, No. You get out my way. ,Modern
227786," What are we going to do? Cos this is my home, and I'm not having it being an alien battleground. ",Modern
226602," Oh, you have been here before. You really can trust me on that.  ",Modern
235389, Tell me that's not her.   Jamila. ,Modern
179538," Oh, thank you, thank you! ",Modern
165950," I know. It's on the telly. It's everywhere. She's lucky to be alive. Honestly, it's aged her. Skin like an old bible. Walking in now you'd think I was her daughter. Oh, and here's himself. ",Modern
220771, Something wrong? ,Modern
189039," I saw the Daleks. What we have done, throughout time and space, I saw the truth of us, Creator, and I decreed, no more! ",Modern
174103," That's the black hole, officially designated K three seven Gen five. ",Modern
216449," Yes, there is an alien organism in your brain, eating it. Of course it's getting worse. ",Modern
231305," Er, did it come from that way, sire? I thought it came from the other way. Come on.",Modern
233626," Not in the least, Mister Babbage. ",Modern
211750," Oh, yes.",Modern
185139," Hold on, hold on. Get off me, get off me. Got to bring the Tardis down.   Right, now. Martha, you coming? ",Modern
216266, I really didn't. ,Modern
235099," Look at me. I know my own life. I'm Ruth Clayton. I am 44. I'm married. I'm a tour guide. And I am scared. Back then... that was not me.  My hands, they just moved. They... ",Modern
183282," I was right. It's always like this with you, innit? ",Modern
198189, Why does it look like a NASA spacesuit? ,Modern
235220, Will you be quiet? ,Modern
241129, Jump to your fate! Now! I said leave! ,Modern
188111," Oh, thanks. ",Modern
216271, I miss you. ,Modern
231234, Maybe she was ashamed of the woman who brought her up. ,Modern
200566," This isn't the River Song we know yet. This is her right at the start. Doesn't even know her own name.  RIVER   [ Oh, that's magnificent! ",Modern
177102, Just the Doctor. ,Modern
233859, Loads. ,Modern
226718," You're telling me. I think, I think I've still got the bump. ",Modern
218027, How did you do that?!  ,Modern
226097, Course I can. I'm going to. ,Modern
181604," Chan Yana, won't you please take some rest tho?",Modern
190980, I can see them. ,Modern
199628," When they destroy us, the eyes are the last things to melt. And there's one question in those eyes. Why? Why should we suffer for the sake of human beings? ",Modern
192779," Well, yeah. ",Modern
229138," Well, you're not going to open it?  ",Modern
168915, Hello. ,Modern
234458," No to the death current, no AC! No to the death current, no AC! No to the death current, no AC!  ",Modern
206181," If I can't find them, you definitely can't. ",Modern
199730," Nice try, but I know, okay? We've been through too much. You're my Doctor. End of.",Modern
236158, A most ungenial summer. I've never known air as dank and frigid. ,Modern
202006," Sophie, you don't need to number food. ",Modern
180158," But it's silly, that's all. Just stories. ",Modern
166854, A few billion. And all of us in need of corpses. ,Modern
213110, I'll let you know. I may have a vacancy. But not right now.  Two days. I can do it.,Modern
191328," Hey, no, hey! That's mine. Hush. Look around you. I've transplanted myself into every single human being. But who wants a mongrel little species like them, because now I can transplant myself into every single Time Lord. Oh, yes, Mister President, sir, standing there all noble and resplendent and decrepit. Think how much better you're going to look as me.   No, no, don't. No, no, stop it! No, no, no, don't! ",Modern
196437," No, no, no. You've got it wrong. ",Modern
171514, It's happened again. One of the patients is conscious. ,Modern
224944," Do you understand now? Do you see? Asking them for help has conditions. Invite them in, and it will be the last free action you take. ",Modern
234369, Get out of here. ,Modern
207980," The boss. Yep, that's me.   I am the boss. ",Modern
176094, What's that supposed to mean? ,Modern
201727, The walls move. Everything changes. ,Modern
226398, Nothing comes out of a black hole.  ,Modern
202890, In the garden. ,Modern
223197," Safe, with a frisson of excitement. ",Modern
217578, Pritchard! Where you have you been? Everyone's been looking for you. What's with the wet suit?  ,Modern
188880," Look, they're leaving. Dad, they're going. The Daleks are going! ",Modern
195711, I pulled the zigzag plotter. ,Modern
179578, In the vent chamber? ,Modern
174021," Hold on, what does that say? That's weird, it won't translate. ",Modern
171015, Moving in which direction? ,Modern
182859, What about you? ,Modern
223533, What's that? ,Modern
188974," The final prophecy is in place. The Doctor and his children, all gathered as witnesses. Supreme Dalek, the time has come. Now, detonate the Reality bomb!",Modern
196945," Yes, I am. ",Modern
208506, I lied. ,Modern
229945, Why are you going to do that?,Modern
225046, Being right is easy. We need to win. ,Modern
196325," Well, how did I end up here? ",Modern
231458, You killed people to try and save yourself. ,Modern
180099," Oh, good morning, Mister Smith. ",Modern
179148, And two nights out in a row for you. That's dangerously close to a social life. ,Modern
189140, I know. ,Modern
239982, How did you get here?  ,Modern
213211,"Hello, hello. Hello, Earth. We have a terrible decision to make. It's an uncertain decision, and we don't have a lot of time. The man who normally helps, he's gone. Maybe he's not coming back. In fact, I, I really don't think he is. We're on our own. So, an innocent life versus the future of all mankind. We have forty five minutes to decide.  ",Modern
198981," Well, because. Rory, why? ",Modern
197087, Yes.,Modern
177051, The rain is going up. ,Modern
168650, A time machine. ,Modern
175259," Oh, let's not go into that. ",Modern
228379," Think of what you've gone through to be here, and you're still going. I'm proper impressed.  ",Modern
230270," Short answer, we got dragged through a doorway, into... ",Modern
184187, What is it? ,Modern
228693," Yeah, exactly. ",Modern
174728," I can't open eight point one, John. Not without losing air for the others. ",Modern
237394," I keep thinking - she was barely in here for a couple of minutes and yet she coded the entry lock to our DNA, just like on her own Tardis.  Maybe that's cos she wanted us to be able to follow her, to find her, cos she needed us. I'm going to work it out. I must be able to work it out. ",Modern
187333," That thing, whatever it is, killed the driver, and the mechanic, and I don't think she's finished yet. ",Modern
233692, No. I wanted to see you on the last day.  ,Modern
182572, Step away from there. ,Modern
199908, Says the king of grand gestures. This is my factory. I'm not going anywhere. ,Modern
220157, I don't care.  ,Modern
226423, Would you like some tea? ,Modern
172169," Rose, what is it?",Modern
205296, I don't want to talk to them. They're silly. ,Modern
217579," Yeah, where have you been? ",Modern
166263, Thank you very much.   Ah! The Adherents of the Repeated Meme. I bring you air from my lungs. ,Modern
190638, Sit with the Elder of the Ood and share the dreaming. ,Modern
169815," What, Blaidd Drwg? It's Welsh. ",Modern
199960," I wish I could tell you that you'll be loved, that you'll be safe and cared for and protected. But this isn't a time for lies. What you are going to be, Melody is very, very brave. ",Modern
211314, How do I look?,Modern
172840," I'm sorry. I should say, it's alive. ",Modern
228217, I've never seen so much water. ,Modern
177150," Witness the crime. Charge, physical assault. Plea, guilty. Sentence, execution. ",Modern
234470, Mister Tesla isn't building any kind of weapon or going to answer any questions. Excuse me. ,Modern
234078, Was we inside that?  ,Modern
238772,"Come on. Ah. Right, remember what I taught you. Divert this gas into this chamber... and it will render their supply feed inert, and harmless to humans.  Then. rip off... oh, this, and let it all leak out into the air. Got it? Come on, General, next ship, 6.9 minutes left. ",Modern
221184, Who wants to know? ,Modern
203803, Oswin. ,Modern
214862," We are the green shoots that grow between the cracks, the grass that grows over the mass graves. After your wars are over, we will still be Here. We are the life that prevails. ",Modern
199658," You're right, there's power. ",Modern
197816, But why would a little girl be here? ,Modern
227562, I've no idea. ,Modern
183338," Mark the date, Miss Carter. Happy birthday. One million birthdays.",Modern
222320, My badge!,Modern

210964, We get into its head. ,Modern
188792, They killed him. ,Modern
183621," No, no, no, no. Let her talk. ",Modern
232224, There's more through here. What do we do? We only came to rescue two people. There's dozens in there. How are we going to get them all out?,Modern
194205," This is my life now and it just turned you white as a sheet, so don't you call it dull again, ever. Okay? ",Modern
226064," It's simple. Bit of noise, lure the beast here, drive it back through the gate. ",Modern
226730, What level are we on? ,Modern
187826, There is something on your back. ,Modern
205759, He's bringing her in. ,Modern
220828, It's a diamond. ,Modern
228341, Fine. ,Modern
203536, Because you will have no other means of escape. ,Modern
199060, You'll have about twelve seconds before the room goes into phase with the invading Matrix. I'll send you the pass key when you get there. Good luck. ,Modern
182752, What is it? Are they losing air?,Modern
238364," Come on, Doctor. There must be something you can do.  ",Modern
213010," Yes, explain. Who is he? Why have you never mentioned him?",Modern
178318," A doctor. Huh. Well, we got stockbrokers, we got a lawyer, but you're the first doctor. Neighbourhood gets classier by the day. ",Modern
229723, Right.  ,Modern
219899, Clara! Clara! Clara! ,Modern
214032, Zero.,Modern
170914," My mate Stan, he'll put us up. ",Modern
211404, You may also prove useful. Bring her.,Modern
194619, She was taken. Into the Earth. ,Modern
223275," Hotter, too. Hotter than they can measure. ",Modern
241000, And some we do. ,Modern
240548, Exterminate! ,Modern
226351, Re-pair.  ,Modern
236990," It's a sad day for us all here, but if any man can be said to have earned a peaceful retirement, it's our Brendan.  On behalf of the local community, and everyone past and present who you've helped, we'd like to present you with this memento.  May we all live up to the standards you've set us. Thank you, Brendan.

209301, Countermanded. ,Modern
223665," No, shut up. These are my mates, too.   Paul! Not funny! ",Modern
177837, Everyone goes to the motorway in the end. I've lost them. ,Modern
230237, Why should I trust what you think? ,Modern
189567," Oh, the voices. The voices. They're screaming. ",Modern

235968," Yeah, but what?  ",Modern
172262," Two quid, love. ",Modern
212152, That's just how my face looks when he talks.,Modern
232459," Lovely Giuseppe Piazzi.   Shall we do one more? Make it a round twenty. I'm thinking Quantifer, little settlement on the edge of the known universe,  where it's permanently New Year's Eve. Every day. They've got the best balloons. ",Modern
189105, Oh. Thought I'd got rid of you.,Modern
205404," Got what, sir? ",Modern
234113, Just talking. Having a conversation.  ,Modern
222634," Kezzia, don't come in just yet. ",Modern
226311, She's different.  ,Modern
178860, But you're the template. I thought they were getting a dose of you. ,Modern
219952," I'm afraid no intruder leaves this place without a memory wipe. With respect, that will include you.  ",Modern
185156," What, like set fire to the atmosphere? ",Modern
171128," Harriet Jones, Prime Minister. ",Modern
182832, Morvin! ,Modern
195968, But you can't be upstairs. ,Modern
186651," Er, it hasn't got a face. Did you see Doctor Moon? ",Modern
238611, Just Vinder's fine. ,Modern
208941, It means we're going to need a new horse. ,Modern
214468, And that's the bad news. The Tardis doesn't have enough dimensional energy to pull it off. ,Modern
187416, Calling me a coward? ,Modern
221294," Your Majesty, I assure you, she is the perfect bait. When this woman is in danger, the Doctor will always come. ",Modern
190100, That's quite enough of that. ,Modern
220658," Oh, Clara Oswald. What am I doing? You're right. You're always, always right.  ",Modern
197532, Salud! ,Modern
241163, Yeah? ,Modern
201642," Yeah, give me a minute and your cutest smile. That's the one. ",Modern
184916," Did you never wonder about its design? It's a phone box. It contains a phone. A telephonic device for communication. Sort of symbolic. Like, if only we could communicate, you and I. ",Modern

204125," No, you need to learn some manners. ",Modern
225011, What are you doing? ,Modern
204499," Half man, half machine. A weapon. Jex built it. He and his team took volunteers, told them they'd been selected for special training, then experimented on them, fused their bodies with weaponry, and programmed them to kill. ",Modern
213960," Someone shut that man up! For the record, it didn't even flinch.",Modern
174044, Move it! Come on! Keep moving. Come on! Quickly! Move it! ,Modern

179947, What? ,Modern
193315," It's hard to put in your terms, Doctor Song, but as best I understand it, the Angels are laughing. ",Modern
236826, I... I'm fine. I'm fine! Which way did he go? Come on. ,Modern
214953," Really? What person is that, then?  ",Modern

198353, Hello. ,Modern
203964," Oh, well done, whoever you are. Looking for engines. Thank you, computer. Look at that. Different sections have engines, but these look like the primary clusters. Where are we now, computer? We need to get down to these engines. ",Modern
231499," From what Becka said, I'm guessing the Morax are royals with soldiers. Pretty brutal ones at that. Presumably exiled for war crimes,  scrambled down into their primal form. ",Modern
200331," This was exactly you. All this. All of it. You make them so afraid. When you began, all those years ago, sailing off to see the universe, did you ever think you'd become this? The man who can turn an army around at the mention of his name. Doctor. The word for healer and wise man throughout the universe. We get that word from you, you know. But if you carry on the way you are, what might that word come to mean? To the people of the Gamma Forests, the word Doctor means mighty warrior. How far you've come. And now they've taken a child, the child of your best friends, and they're going to turn her into a weapon just to bring you down. And all this, my love, in fear of you. ",Modern
175528, I sing to her. ,Modern
238891, I thought you were going for pizza. ,Modern
199179," Spacey wacey, isn't it? ",Modern

238776, It's a wok. ,Modern
166647," No, it means fanatic, devoted to. Mind you, I've got to say, that American bit in Martin Chuzzlewit, what's that about? Was that just padding or what? I mean, it's rubbish, that bit. ",Modern

203990, Doctor! ,Modern
220957, That will not be necessary. You will be uploaded. We apologise for the inconvenience. ,Modern

228652, Or am I? Rosa takes the bus on the 1st December 1955. What time of day? ,Modern

202048, At what? ,Modern
177969, Joined from the Pharmacy Town junction. ,Modern
178349, The plan must not fail. We calculate the gamma strike has accelerated. We need more bodies immediately. ,Modern
207094, What was that? ,Modern
166587, That you're human. ,Modern
223090," Are you sure of that? That collar's for a big dog. With long white hair. Nice con, though. Respect. ",Modern
192523," But those creatures, my Ironsides, they made me? I can remember things. So many things. The last war. The squalor and the mud and the awful, awful misery of it all. What am I? What am I? ",Modern
224131," All the suits got the same command. Best guess, someone hacked the network.  ",Modern
234021, Shh. Don't run. Psst. ,Modern
172803, There were many doors between my world and yours. Can you not use one of the others? ,Modern
193476, Yeah. It was the same shape. ,Modern
210041," Oh, I don't know. Talk very fast, hope something good happens, take the credit. That's generally how it works. ",Modern

216600," Wherever you go, there are people who care enough to find you. ",Modern
228944," We get off at the next stop, right? ",Modern

230766, What do you think it means? ,Modern
232338," No, it isn't. That creature took advantage of your faith. How could he recognise me, Andinio? We've met before. He's an exile from a warrior race called the Stenza. When we met, he was killing people for no reason on the planet he wants you to destroy.  ",Modern
201399, Amy. ,Modern

219221, North America reporting back to High Command. ,Modern
168371," From time to time, someone, yes, but the computer chip system allows me to see inside their brains. I can see the smallest doubt and crush it.   Then they just carry on, living the life, strutting about downstairs and all over the surface of the Earth like they're so individual, when of course, they're not. They're just cattle. In that respect, the Jagrafess hasn't changed a thing. ",Modern

222149, Huh. Twenty four years. What a night. ,Modern
197550, That's an astronaut. That's an Apollo astronaut in a lake. ,Modern
168184, That's so not fair. I've been applying to Floor five hundred for three years. ,Modern
191840, Who was your lady friend? ,Modern
193207, Two minutes. ,Modern
190180," Oh, come on. We're the first off-world colonists in history. Everyone on planet Earth knows who we are. ",Modern

167001," Yes, we are. ",Modern
213127, What's happening?  ,Modern

183063, That enough for trinkets? ,Modern
206359, Can you feel the light on your eyelids? That is the light of an alien sun. Forward a couple of steps. Okay. Are you ready? ,Modern
207864," Doctor, I've been thinking. The chimney ",Modern
233001, It shouldn't be doing that. ,Modern

191470, Could I have an apple? All I can think about. Apples. I love apples. Maybe I'm having a craving? That's new. Never had cravings before.   Whoa. Look at that. ,Modern
208544, That can't be right. ,Modern
236720, We're not ready. I haven't got Feekat and Ethan. ,Modern
232041," My friends are going to take a look round your ship, if that's okay. See what you can find out. ",Modern
235563," I might need a high-powered microscope, blood cultures, rapid genome sequencing, a spectrophotometer, and a super fast incubator. ",Modern
179587," Blimey, do you always leave things in such a mess?  Mc ",Modern
166959," Then what is it? Because you, you waltz in here all charm and smiles, and the next thing I know, she vanishes off the face of the Earth! How old are you then? Forty? Forty five? What, did you find her on the Internet? Did you go online and pretend you're a doctor? ",Modern

I mean, this is exactly where you dump a smelly old uncle slash family pet slash genius scientist who couldn't even invent legs. Seriously, how do your boys take it when everybody else has got two eyes?  ",Modern
203110," Er, sir. Er, with regret, I'm going to have to lower my gun. ",Modern
171023," Coming for what, though? The Doctor? ",Modern

205386," Where's what, sir? ",Modern
201620," Do not be alarmed, this is a kindness. This is a kindness. ",Modern
179351," Mum, get back! ",Modern
216207," Because those are exactly the things I want, and you are too clever ever to be wrong. ",Modern
175329," Look, kids run off sometimes, all right? That's what they do. ",Modern
219118," Come on, you don't invade planets without having kind of plan. That's why they're called planets, to remind you to plan it? Hey, hey! That's good! Pun-tastic. Doctor Pun-tastic! Oh, come on, that was a good one, Zygella! ",Modern

233158," Wow! This is some set-up. Paranoid, are we? ",Modern
199207," So I think we'd better talk about what just happened back there. I could get compensation. I've seen the holo-ads. Had an accident in the workplace? Yeah, I have as it goes. I melted. ",Modern
200968," Maybe it was things on the telly, you know? ",Modern

233475, I'm not panicking! ,Modern
229928," Okay, it's rigged. I've leached some system power off the anti-matter drive. Now, if they can keep that up and running, we'll have enough power  to keep basic systems going and still get to Resus One. That's if that thing doesn't get in there and drain the energy. ",Modern
228932," Oh, thank you, Mrs Parks. Beautiful work. Much appreciated. ",Modern
170186, Give me that accessory. ,Modern
221736," Well, that's just a measure of our concern. ",Modern

222347, Oh!,Modern
210214, I accept.,Modern
185307, How long's this war gone on for? ,Modern
221916," Trial and error, to be honest. A  few accidental stop-offs along the way. ",Modern
188530," He did. And I've wondered about that for a long time, whether I was wrong. But I stand by my actions to this day, because I knew, I knew ",Modern

182945, Information. No. ,Modern
232494," Probably. It looks like it slid down this wall and into the water. Where are we, exactly? ",Modern

201081, What's happening? ,Modern
177939, Okay. ,Modern
218109, Because I think this village just declared war on them. ,Modern

166883, What're you doing? ,Modern
207722," If she hasn't make contact by nightfall, I suggest a massive frontal assault on the factory, madam. Casualties can be kept to perhaps as little as eighty percent. ",Modern

220325, I thought I'd find you down here. Old times. ,Modern
171861," They came through the house. In the excitement they took the Steward and the Master, and my Lady. ",Modern
185155," That's why the Sontarans had to stop the missiles. They were holding back. Because caesofine gas is volatile, that's why they had to use you to stop the nuclear attack. Ground to air engagement could spark off the whole thing. ",Modern

240396, There's a way to deal with the remnants of it.  ,Modern
180149, It's become quite a hobby. ,Modern
217004," See how they play with her. See how they toy. They want her to run. They need her to run. Do you feel their need, Doctor? Their blood is screaming kill, kill, kill! Hunter and prey, held in the ecstasy of crisis. Is this not life at its purest?",Modern
167254, Would you rather silent but deadly? ,Modern
185744, Murder on the Orient Express? ,Modern
227959," I'm just a traveller. Sometimes I see things need fixing, I do what I can. Except right now, I'm a traveller without a ship. I've stayed too long.  I should get back to finding my Tardis. ",Modern

220578, Even the other immortals are gone. It's just me. ,Modern
208326, I think you should ask Porridge. ,Modern
227823," The challenge is simple. Our leaders randomly designate a selected human. I'm sent here, alone, no weapons, no assistance.  I must locate and obtain the trophy and return home with it, victorious. By doing this, I ascend to leader. This is the ritual of the Stenza. ",Modern
