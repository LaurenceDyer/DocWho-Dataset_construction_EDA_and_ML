18, [Jungle]
19,
20, (A strange humanoid with a thick head of hair and
21,"single eye where our mouth is, is walking along carefully. The Tardis"
22,"materialises and new girl Dodo Chaplet dashes out, wearing a crusades"
23,style tabard. She sneezes. Steven follows her.) 
24,STEVEN: Just where do you think you're going? 
25,DODO: Out. 
26,STEVEN: Out? 
27,"DODO: Yes, I thought I'd get some fresh air. Somebody opened the door"
28,and 
29,STEVEN: But nobody said you could go out. 
30,DODO: Do they have to then? 
31,"STEVEN: Well, of course they do. "
32,(Dodo is walking away.) 
33,"STEVEN: Look, Dodo, you don't know what you might have found out here."
34,"No gravity, poisoned atmosphere, all sorts of things. Look, stop"
35,prancing around over there. What happens if you get lost? 
36,DODO: I catch a bus back. 
37,"STEVEN: A bus? Look, what are you talking about? I mean, just where do"
38,you think you are? 
39,"DODO: Ah! Bet you thought you'd caught me, didn't you? Bet you thought"
40,"I didn't know. Well, I do. "
41,STEVEN: You do? 
42,DODO: Of course I do. 
43,"STEVEN: What, this place? I mean, you recognise it? What, with all"
44,these strange animals and flowers and things? 
45,(Toucan in the trees.) 
46,"STEVEN: Well, you can't have been here before. "
47,DODO: Yes I have. It's just outside London. I came here once with the
48,school. It's called Whipsnade. 
49,"STEVEN: Just outside London? Look, wait a minute. I mean, it can't be. "
50,"DODO: Yes, it is. I bet if you go down that path there, you'll come to"
51,the American Bison and the Tea Bar. 
52,"STEVEN: Look, we don't even know that we're on Earth. "
53,"DODO: Earth? Earth? Well, it couldn't be anywhere else now, could it?"
54,"Hey, look Steven, that proves it. That's a chameleon. "
55,STEVEN: What this? 
56,"DODO: And here's a monitor. Look, that's a Locust. There, what did I"
57,tell you? 
58,"STEVEN: Look, how do you know all this? "
59,DODO: I learnt it at school. There's nothing you can tell me about
60,"nature, simply nothing. "
61,(A creature calls) 
62,STEVEN: Having second thoughts? 
63,"DODO: No! I just don't remember Whipsnade being so rowdy, that's all. "
64,(The Doctor comes out of the Tardis.) 
65,"DOCTOR: Improbable as it may seem, dear boy, I think the child,"
66,Dorothea 
67,DODO: Dodo! 
68,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, of course, my dear. Dodo is right. "
69,STEVEN: What? You mean it is Earth? 
70,"DOCTOR: Well, I can't tell you just yet. All I can say is that it's"
71,more likely to be Earth than anywhere else and it's very strange
72,"indeed. You know, I've been taking a look at my instruments in there"
73,and it's really very strange. 
74,(The Doctor and Steven are watched as they go back into the Tardis.)

76, [Control deck]
77,
78, (A printout reads - VERDICT .... 20 - 0 = GUILTY.
79,Another of the one-eyed people hands the paper to a human at a higher
80,level desk. A young man is escorted in. Every human is wearing a
81,garment made of strips of cloth hanging from a thick collar.) 
82,"COMMANDER: Prisoner, you've been found guilty of extreme carelessness"
83,in carrying out your duties. By leaving open a wide valve in the heat
84,"exchange unit, you could have caused an explosion that would have been"
85,"fatal not only to the human race, but also to our friends, the Monoids."
86,"As your commander, Galactic law gives me wide powers in such cases. The"
87,safety of our people must be preserved at all costs. In these grave
88,"circumstances, the lightest sentence I can pass is one of"
89,miniaturisation. Prepare the Minifier. Sentence will be carried out
90,"immediately. The prisoner will be retained at micro-cell size, to be"
91,"re-constituted in approximately seven hundred years time, when it can"
92,no longer be a danger to us. Does the prosecution accept this sentence?
93,
94,"(A man signs to a Monoid, who nods.) "
95,ZENTOS: We do. 
96,COMMANDER: Has the defence anything further to say on the prisoner's
97,behalf? 
98,(A young woman runs up to the desk.) 
99,"MELLIUM: Father, anyone can make mistakes. He's not likely to do it"
100,again. 
101,"COMMANDER: My child, we are the Guardians of the human race. You know"
102,"our responsibilities cannot be taken lightly. Under Galactic law, the"
103,only alternative punishment would be expulsion. 
104,"MANYAK: Sir, the prisoner accepts the verdict and thanks you for your"
105,clemency in not imposing a harsher sentence. 
106,COMMANDER: Very well. Proceed. 
107,MELLIUM: Goodbye. 
108,(The young man is escorted by two Monoids into a booth. He crouches on
109,the floor as a Monoid presses a switch and he shrinks smaller and
110,smaller until he cannot be seen. One of the humans enters the booth and
111,lifts a small tray containing the miniaturised convict off the floor.
112,He walks away with it. The prosecution Monoid signs to Zentos.) 
113,"ZENTOS: My learned friend wishes to thank you, sir, on behalf of the"
114,"Monoids, for the care you take of us all. "
115,
116, [Jungle]
117,
118," DODO: Look, Doctor. "
119,(An elephant walks through the trees.) 
120,"DODO: Hey, look at him then. "
121,(The travellers go over to him.) 
122,STEVEN: Well? 
123,"DOCTOR: Well, it's just as I said. It's all very, very strange. That is"
124,an Indian elephant. 
125,"STEVEN: Yes, I know. What difference does that make? What does it"
126,prove? 
127,"DOCTOR: Well, that's what I'm trying to find out, dear boy. "
128,"DODO: Flowers from America, birds from Africa, a snake from Brazil and"
129,now an elephant from India. 
130,"DOCTOR: Exactly, my dear. "
131,STEVEN: It's a jungle incorporating things from all over the world. 
132,"DOCTOR: Yes, you're quite right, my boy. Yes, and top of everything"
133,"else, it's a jungle without a sky. "
134,"DODO: Hey, look at that then. "
135,STEVEN: No sky? 
136,"DOCTOR: No sun, no clouds, merely a metal roof radiating some kind of"
137,light. 
138,STEVEN: It's extraordinary. 
139,"DOCTOR: Yes, and plus something else. "
140,DODO: What's that? 
141,"DOCTOR: The earth, this, this ground we're standing on. It appears to"
142,be trembling. 
143,DODO: It is more elephants coming? 
144,STEVEN: An earthquake building up? 
145,"DOCTOR: No, it's too regular for that. No, it's more of a mechanical"
146,vibration. Yes. 
147,STEVEN: Look. 
148,DOCTOR: Extraordinary. 
149,STEVEN: In what circumstances do you get all these things together? I
150,"mean, animals and vegetable life from different continents? "
151,DODO: With a metal roof and all this shaking? 
152,DOCTOR: There's only one thing that strikes me. This could be some kind
153,of indoor nature park. 
154,"STEVEN: Yes, but on this scale? "
155,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, improbable dear boy, but possible. Definitely"
156,possible. 
157,"DODO: But are we on Earth or, or "
158,DOCTOR: Mmm? 
159,DODO: Choo! (Dodo sneezes again.) 
160,"DOCTOR: Oh, bless you my dear. "
161,"DODO: Oh, thanks. "
162,"DOCTOR: You have a handkerchief, I hope? "
163,DODO: Of course I have. 
164,"DOCTOR: Well then, use it, my child! We must do something about that"
165,"cold of yours. That reminds me, why are you dressed in these stupid"
166,clothes? Have you been footling about in my wardrobe? Is that what it
167,"is? What do you think you're playing at, crusades? "
168,"DODO: I'm not playing at anything. Is it all right to wear, or do I"
169,have to ask permission for that as well? 
170,"DOCTOR: Yes, you do my dear. Now you take care of them because you"
171,"never know when we might use them. Now, I suggest we take a last look"
172,round and we'll get you off to bed. 
173,"DODO: Oh, you're not going to send me home, are you? "
174,"DOCTOR: Home? Ho, ho! What an idea. I couldn't send you home even if I"
175,wanted to. 
176,"DODO: Oh, that's all right, then. I think I'm beginning to enjoy this"
177,space travel or whatever it is.
178,
179, [Control deck]
180,
181,(It is now a busy place. A Monoid is driving a
182,tractor unit hauling a crate. Others are signing to each other.
183,Children are playing. A Monoid signs to Zentos. He goes over to the
184,Commander and Mellium who are looking at a design.) 
185,ZENTOS: Commander? 
186,"COMMANDER: Yes, Zentos? "
187,ZENTOS: A strange report from the jungle. The Monoids acquaint us of
188,intruders. 
189,COMMANDER: Intruders? But how can that be? How could they have entered
190,it? 
191,ZENTOS: I've no idea. I'll try and trace them. 
192,MELLIUM: But surely it's impossible for anyone to be in the jungle that
193,"we don't know about? Well, where will they have come from? "
194,COMMANDER: I don't know. Perhaps when we see them? 
195,(An overhead view of Steven and the Doctor comes up on the wall
196,viewscreen.) 
197,ZENTOS: Here they are. 
198,"COMMANDER: They look like human beings, but they can't be. We accounted"
199,for everyone. 
200,ZENTOS: Shall we not arrest them and bring them here and question them?
201,
202,"MELLIUM: Father, look. It seems to be their spaceship. It is an unusual"
203,design. 
204,COMMANDER: Are we sure this is nothing to do with the Monoids? 
205,ZENTOS: Quite sure. It was they who reported it. 
206,"COMMANDER: Good, then you're right. They must be questioned. But"
207,"Zentos, not arrested. Invited. "
208,(The community gather to watch the travellers on the viewscreen.)
209,
210,[Jungle]
211,
212," DODO: Doctor, Steven, get a look at these fab"
213,pictures! 
214,(She's found some rock paintings.) 
215,"DOCTOR: Ah, fab, hmm. My dear child, if you're going to be with us for"
216,"any length of time, you'll have to do something about that English of"
217,yours. 
218,DODO: What's wrong with it? 
219,"DOCTOR: It's terrible, child. Oh, it's most irritating. Well, look at"
220,"that now. Isn't that extraordinary? Ah, very interesting. It looks like"
221,a zebra with two heads. 
222,"STEVEN: Yes, well, that could be the imagination of the artist. "
223,"DOCTOR: Hmm, perhaps and perhaps not. What then. Yes, we've already"
224,established this place as illogical. Why shouldn't there be animals
225,with two heads? 
226,"STEVEN: No reason at all, except that the more we see of it, the less"
227,like Earth it becomes. 
228,(An alarm sounds.) 
229,DODO: What's that? Do you think somebody's seen us. 
230,STEVEN: There's only one way to find out. 
231,DOCTOR: Yes! 
232,(Steven goes off and sees that there are Monoids at the Tardis.) 
233,STEVEN: You were right. It is an alarm. They've found the Tardis. I
234,can't say I like the look of them. 
235,DODO: What's that? 
236,(The alarm stops.) 
237,"STEVEN: They're coming this way, searching for us. "
238,DODO: There's a kind of cave there. 
239,"STEVEN: Go on, you go ahead. "
240,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes. What do they look like, dear boy? "
241,"STEVEN: Terrifying. Is this is Earth, it's no longer inhabited by human"
242,beings. 
243,DOCTOR: Shh. You'll frighten the child. Come on. 
244, [Cave]
245,
246, DODO: What are they? Some awful 
247,"DOCTOR: Now, don't worry child. You're quite safe with us. "
248,"DODO: Yeah, but supposing they have two heads? "
249,(Steven stifles her sneeze as the Monoids pass the cave entrance.) 
250,STEVEN: Bless you. Remind me never to take you out again when you've
251,got a cold. 
252,"DOCTOR: Now, let's try and get back to the Tardis. Take care. This"
253,might be dangerous. 
254,(Dodo sneezes.) 
255,STEVEN: Quiet! (Dodo sniffles.) What's the matter? Are you crying? 
256,"DODO: No, me nose is running! "
257,"DOCTOR: Just do as he says, child. This may be very difficult. "
258, [Jungle]
259,
260,(Steven leads the way.) 
261,STEVEN: Doctor! 
262,"DOCTOR: Why, yes, of course. Yes! I know where I am now. Yes, indeed! "
263,"STEVEN: It looks like some sort of city, factory? "
264,(Just beyond the jungle edge is a high-rise cityscape.) 
265,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, dear boy. All this is a spaceship! "
266,STEVEN: A spaceship? 
267,"DOCTOR: Yes, exactly! "
268,"DODO: Hey, Doctor? If this is a spaceship what are they? "
269,(A group of Monoids with sticks stand up.) 
270,
271, [Control deck]
272,
273,(The printer is automatically transcribing the
274,conversation. Traveller: you found our vehicle.) 
275,COMMANDER: You travel in that black box? 
276,STEVEN: Yes. 
277,"COMMANDER: Well, how are you able to make your spaceship enter ours? "
278,STEVEN: It isn't just a spaceship. It can travel anywhere in time or
279,space. 
280,ZENTOS: Why have you chosen to come here? 
281,"STEVEN: Well, we didn't. It has a mind of its own. "
282,COMMANDER: I don't understand. Experiments to pass through the fourth
283,dimension were undertaken in the twenty seventh segment of time. They
284,were unsuccessful. How can anything so crude 
285,"STEVEN: Look, I told you before. The Doctor's the one who will tell you"
286,what you want to know. 
287,(The Commander signs to a Monoid.) 
288,STEVEN: May I ask a question also? 
289,ZENTOS: No! 
290,COMMANDER: Why not? We're all friends here. 
291,"STEVEN: Look, is this really a spaceship? This city and all that"
292,surrounds it? 
293,"COMMANDER: Yes, indeed. "
294,(He goes over to a console and points at a schematic. The city is at
295,the edge of a huge circle.) 
296,COMMANDER: Here we are. 
297,"STEVEN: That's the biggest we've ever seen. Look, who are you and these"
298,creatures that serve you? 
299,"COMMANDER: Like you, we come from the Earth. The origin of the Monoids"
300,"is obscure. They came to Earth many years ago, apparently from their"
301,own planet which was dying. They offered us their invaluable services
302,for being allowed to come on this joint voyage. 
303,STEVEN: And where you are going? 
304,COMMANDER: To Refusis Two. The Earth also is dying. We have left it for
305,the last time. 
306,STEVEN: The last time? 
307,COMMANDER: Yes. In a short time it will burn and be swallowed in the
308,pull of the Sun. 
309,STEVEN: Then we must have journeyed forward millions of years. 
310,"ZENTOS: You yourself, I take it, are human? "
311,"STEVEN: Why yes, of course. "
312,COMMANDER: Why do you doubt him? 
313,"ZENTOS: They could be Refusians sent here to intercept us, to sabotage"
314,our mission. 
315,STEVEN: Refusians? From the planet you're headed for? 
316,COMMANDER: Explain. 
317,ZENTOS: We only know them as intelligence's that inhabit that planet.
318,"They might have a way of assuming human bodies, of using them to pass,"
319,to mingle amongst us! 
320,"DOCTOR: Oh, rubbish, rubbish. With all our imperfections, I can assure"
321,"you, sir, if you were to cut my skin, I would bleed, the same as you"
322,would. 
323,STEVEN: That's right. 
324,(Dodo sneezes.) 
325,"DOCTOR: There you see, complete with chills. "
326,ZENTOS: Chills? 
327,DOCTOR: A virus fever which used to be quite common to the human being.
328,
329,COMMANDER: And cured so long ago we've forgotten what it was like.
330,"Fascinating! It's like history coming to life. Tell me, Doctor, if you"
331,"cannot direct your spacecraft, your journeys must take you to some"
332,strange places. 
333,(Zentos has been signing to a Monoid.) 
334,MELLIUM: What were you telling him? 
335,ZENTOS: I wish to know more of the traveller's spacecraft. 
336,MELLIUM: You do not trust the travellers? 
337,ZENTOS: I know nothing of them. Your father trusts them. 
338,MELLIUM: He knows no more than you. He simply has faith. 
339,"ZENTOS: So have I, in my own eyes and ears, and machines tell fewer"
340,lies than men. 
341,DOCTOR: Including the Daleks. 
342,"COMMANDER: Nero, the Trojan wars, the Daleks. But all that happened in"
343,the first segment of time. 
344,"DOCTOR: Segment? To use your phrase, sir, what segment are we in now? "
345,COMMANDER: The fifty seventh. 
346,DOCTOR: Good gracious! We must have jumped at least ten million years. 
347,STEVEN: When do you expect your journey to end? 
348,"COMMANDER: Not for a long time. Neither I, nor my daughter Mellium, nor"
349,"Zentos, will ever see the planet. That pleasure is reserved for our"
350,"children's children, many years hence. "
351,STEVEN: How long from now? 
352,"COMMANDER: Using your measurement of time, seven hundred years. "
353,"DOCTOR: Seven hundred years, but why travel that far? Surely "
354,COMMANDER: Only Refusis has the same conditions that we had on Earth.
355,"Atmosphere, water, the right temperature. "
356,STEVEN: Has anyone ever been there? 
357,COMMANDER: No. Our knowledge is based purely on audio-space research. 
358,"STEVEN: No wonder you had to bring everything. At least two of each, I"
359,suppose? 
360,DODO: Like the Ark? 
361,COMMANDER: The Ark? 
362,"DODO: Yeah, Noah's ark. You know, two by two. The flood. "
363,COMMANDER: I'm afraid I don't know. But we do have the Earth's full
364,"population, human and animal. "
365,"DOCTOR: Yes, but where, sir? I can only see but a few people. "
366,COMMANDER: We are the Guardians. The rest have been reduced to
367,micro-cell size. 
368,
369,[Storage chamber]
370,
371, (A Monoid works in the room.) COMMANDER : They
372,are stored in trays and will re-emerge normally when we land. Each
373,"cabinet contains a million people. Oh, yes. There are many things"
374,aboard our ship which would interest a traveller. 
375, [Control deck]
376,
377," COMMANDER: Mellium, why don't you show the young"
378,people the statue? 
379,MELLIUM: Would you like to see it? 
380,"DODO: It depends, what is "
381,"STEVEN: Yes, of course we would. Come on, Dodo. "
382,MELLIUM: This way. 
383,COMMANDER: While I am sure that you would be more interested in the
384,technicalities of our control deck. 
385,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, indeed! "
386,"COMMANDER: Then I'll leave you with our chief controller, Manyak. He"
387,will explain everything. 
388,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
389,"DOCTOR: Now tell me, that noise we heard just now. Was that a flight"
390,adjustment? 
391,"MANYAK: No, sir, refueling pause. "
392,"(Mellium, Steven and Dodo are by the base of a giant statue.) "
393,"MELLIUM: Here it is, Homo Sapiens. Started on Earth, due to be"
394,completed just before the landing on Refusis. 
395,STEVEN: What? Seven hundred years to sculpt one statue? 
396,"MELLIUM: Yes, we're constructing it by hand using the ancient methods."
397,"It's for our children and our children's children, so that they can"
398,watch it grow gradually as time goes by. 
399,(Dodo has to stand on a ladder just to be able to reach the toe of the
400,statue.) 
401,"DODO: What is it made of? You can't scratch it, can you? "
402,STEVEN: Dodo! You'll have to watch her. She'll have the whole thing
403,down. 
404,MELLIUM: It's a substance called gragarium rock. It'll last for ever.
405,Here's the finished design. (A human holding the spherical Ark in his
406,right hand.) 
407,"DODO: Hey, that's gear! "
408,(An alarm sounds.) 
409,DODO: What's that? All that carry on? 
410,(The launching bay door opens and a tractor unit enters the control
411,deck with a Monoid lying on it. The Commander is holding his head in
412,pain.) 
413,"ZENTOS: Commander, the strange disease, the fever is spreading among"
414,the Monoids. 
415,"COMMANDER: I can hardly hear you, Zentos. It's so hot. What's happened"
416,to the temperature? 
417,"ZENTOS: Commander? The Commander, too. He has the strange fever. The"
418,fever brought by the strangers! 
419,MELLIUM: What is it? What's wrong? 
420,"ZENTOS: Stay away from them, Mellium, and from your father. "
421,MELLIUM: But what is it? 
422,COMMANDER: I don't know. I'm not sure. But Zentos is right. Stay away. 
423,(Dodo feels the Commander's forehead.) 
424,ZENTOS: Don't touch him! 
425,DOCTOR: We may be able to help. 
426,"DODO: It's nothing to worry about. His temperature's a bit high, that's"
427,all. It's just a fever. It can only be a cold. 
428,"DOCTOR: Do you realise what this means, dear boy? "
429,"STEVEN: What's all the fuss about? The man's caught Dodo's cold, that's"
430,all. 
431,"DOCTOR: All? All? These people, this generation, have never experienced"
432,the common cold for the simple reason it was wiped out many generations
433,ago before they were born. They have no resistance to it. 
434,STEVEN: What'll happen? 
435,"DOCTOR: I don't quite know, I don't know. But it might be fatal and we"
436,"shall be to blame. Yes, it's all our fault and I should have foreseen"
437,it. 
438,ZENTOS: Did you hear that? Did I not try and warn the Commander? I told
439,you these people were evil. 
440,DODO: But it wasn't my fault. How was I supposed to know? 
441,MANYAK: The sick Monoid. He's dead. 
442,"ZENTOS: Seize them! All of you listen! The success of all we stand for,"
443,everything aboard this spaceship is suddenly endangered by the strange
444,fever. A fever brought by these strangers in our midst! 
445,DOCTOR: But I 
446,"ZENTOS: I invoke the special Galactic law against them. Hold them, take"
447,"them into custody, and later they will be made to suffer for the crime"
448,that they have committed! 
449,"STEVEN: Look, listen to us! "
450,ZENTOS: Take them away! 
451,(The travellers are marched away.) 
452,MELLIUM: What about my father? 
453,"ZENTOS: He may well die. But then again, so might all of us. In which"
454,"case, it was pointless leaving."

456, Episode Two - The
457,Plague 
458,[Detention Room]
459,
460, (The prisoners have been locked in a room with a
461,bench and table.) 
462,"STEVEN: What do you think they'll do to us, Doctor? "
463,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm not sure, dear boy. We shall just have to wait and"
464,see. 
465,"DODO: It's all my fault. If I'd known it was going to be like this, I'd"
466,never have come. 
467,"DOCTOR: Well you did come, my dear, so it's too late to be worry about"
468,that. And stop snivelling! 
469,"DODO: I'm not snivelling. It's me nose running again! Anyway, I'm"
470,feeling better now but I don't suppose anyone cares. 
471,"DOCTOR: But of course they care, my dear. Now don't worry. It's not"
472,"your fault at all. If it's anybody's, it's mine. "
473,"STEVEN: Look, do you think this has happened before? That we've carried"
474,"an infection from one age to another, or even one planet to another? "
475,"DOCTOR: Oh, I don't want to think it about it, dear boy. It's too"
476,horrifying. Though I must say that we're usually very healthy. 
477,"STEVEN: It'll spread through the whole ship, become an epidemic. "
478,"DOCTOR: Well, that depends on the strength of the virus infection. "
479,"DODO: If it's half as bad as my cold was, it will. "
480,"DOCTOR: Oh, do blow your nose, child. It's running all over the place. "
481,"DODO: No, it isn't. I'm crying this time. "
482,"DOCTOR: Well, look, my dear, do try and rest. You know you may be"
483,"feeling better but you're far from cured. Oh, if only those wretched"
484,Guardians would let us out of here. I might be able to help.
485,
486, [Control deck]
487,
488,(Zentos is watching Monoids fall ill on the CCTV
489,monitors.) 
490,ZENTOS: Look. That's another victim. It's not showing any signs of
491,abating. And look. 
492, [Jungle]
493,
494,(A Monoid collapses right outside the Tardis.) 
495, [Control deck]
496,
497, ZENTOS: That's another victim. Another death. And
498,more human Guardians have also been taken ill. Thank heaven none of
499,them has died yet. 
500,MANYAK: What will happen if one does? 
501,ZENTOS: It'll be disaster. Each man has his allotted task. No one had
502,reckoned on this eventuality. 
503,MANYAK: There must be something we can do about it. 
504,ZENTOS: Our micro-virologists are trying to find the answer. One of
505,them is with the Commander now. 
506,[Commander's room]
507,
508,(A Monoid in a facemask is standing guard by the
509,"bed, and Mellium and Rhos are also wearing facemasks.) "
510,MELLIUM: Is there nothing you can do? 
511,"RHOS: Unfortunately, the data covering this type of fever was lost long"
512,"ago, in the primal wars of the tenth segment. "
513,COMMANDER: Mellium. 
514,"MELLIUM: Yes, father? "
515,COMMANDER: I seem to be drifting back and forth from unconsciousness to
516,moments of sudden clarity. 
517,MELLIUM: Perhaps it's better that you shouldn't talk. 
518,"COMMANDER: No, must, I must. Promise me, Mellium, should anything"
519,happen to me 
520,"MELLIUM: Oh, you mustn't talk this way. "
521,"COMMANDER: Should anything happen, do all in your power, along with the"
522,"others, to make sure the voyage continues. "
523,"MELLIUM: Of course, father. "
524,COMMANDER: What 
525,MELLIUM: But soon you'll get well. 
526,COMMANDER: What happens to me is not so important. Or you for that
527,"matter, or any one of us, but the voyage and the eventual landing of"
528,"our descendants on the planet Refusis, that is! That's the only thing"
529,that's important. Remember that. 
530,"MELLIUM: Yes, father."
531,
532,[Detention Room]
533,
534, DODO: What is it? 
535,DOCTOR: I don't know. 
536,DODO: It sounds like savages. 
537,
538, [Corridor]
539,
540, (It's a Monoid funeral procession. Four of them
541,are carrying a shrouded body on their shoulders.)
542,
543, [Control deck]
544,
545,(The procession enters.) 
546,ZENTOS: Proceed with the preparations for ejection. Commit the body to
547,space burial. 
548,(The body is placed on the back of a tractor unit and driven away. The
549,launching bay hatch closes.) 
550,MANYAK: It is over. 
551,(The body flies out into space.) 
552,"ZENTOS: Guardians, Monoids, before it is too late, before we are"
553,"stricken by the fever ourselves, we must make the strangers answer for"
554,the terrible crime they have committed. 
555,"WOMAN: Yes, they must be tried and punished. "
556,"ZENTOS: A hearing will commence at once. As Deputy Commander, I will"
557,preside. Baccu has undertaken to put the charges. 
558,CROWD: The best man for the job. 
559,ZENTOS: Will anyone speak for the prisoners? 
560,MANYAK: I will. 
561,MELLIUM: And I. My father would wish it.
562,
563, [Commander's room]
564,
565, MELLIUM : His only desire was that
566,justice should be done and a sensible solution to this crisis be found.
567,
568,"COMMANDER: Yes, yes. "
569,
570, [Detention Room]
571,
572, ZENTOS : The law that has been broken
573,is the following 
574,"DODO: Look Doctor, they've switched the television on. "
575,ZENTOS : In that the spaceship represents the only means by
576,"which Earth life may be extended and perpetuated, the Guardian for the"
577,"time being in charge of the ship, shall have absolute power to punish"
578,or restrain any life-form that endangers 
579, [Control deck]
580,
581," ZENTOS: The success of its mission, by expulsion"
582,"from the ship, miniaturisation or such lesser penalty as he shall deem"
583,fit.
584,
585, [Detention Room]
586,
587, DODO: Some sort of trial? 
588,ZENTOS : I call on Baccu to detail the charge. 
589,"DOCTOR: Yes, my dear, and we are the accused. "
590,"MELLIUM : Doctor, Manyak and I believe your story. We've"
591,offered to speak in your defence but at least one of you must give
592,evidence. 
593,DOCTOR: Of course. 
594,STEVEN: I must go. 
595,DOCTOR: What? 
596,"STEVEN: (looking unwell) Doctor, I must. I'm getting stifled in here. I"
597,"must go and do something, even if it's only to show them how stupid"
598,"they are wasting time with trials and speeches. After all, the only"
599,important thing now is to let you organise finding a cure. 
600,"DOCTOR: Very well then, if only they'll listen. "
601,"MELLIUM : They'll probably ask you to speak next, Doctor. "
602,"DOCTOR: My dear, I only want to help. "
603,(A Monoid enters and takes Steven away.) 
604, [Control deck]
605,
606, (Steven is in a barred cage covered in plastic to
607,stop any germs spreading.) 
608,BACCU: My contention is that it was no accident that this disaster has
609,happened. I say that you came here intentionally to spread the disease.
610,
611,STEVEN: But that's utter nonsense. I mean how can you possibly 
612,BACCU: And that you are agents of the planet towards which this
613,spaceship is proceeding. That you came here to destroy us. 
614,STEVEN: Why? We're human beings like you are. Why should we? 
615,ZENTOS: There is the crux of the matter. Do you expect us to believe
616,"that nonsense, that you manage in that ridiculous machine called the"
617,"Tardis, have managed to travel through time? Guardians, Monoids, these"
618,"beings, whatever they are, place a heavy strain on our credulity. "
619,STEVEN: Well that's not very difficult! If your medical records are
620,"anything to go by, this segment of time, far from being one of the most"
621,"advanced in knowledge, is one of the worst! "
622,ZENTOS: We can cope with all things known to the fifty seventh segment
623,"of Earth life, but not with strange diseases brought by you as agents"
624,of the intelligences that inhabit Refusis! 
625,STEVEN: Are you still on about that? I've told you before. We know
626,nothing of that planet. 
627,"ZENTOS: My instinct, every fibre of my being, tells me differently. "
628,"STEVEN: And that, unfortunately, tells me only one thing. "
629,ZENTOS: What's that? 
630,"STEVEN: That the nature of man, even in this day and age, hasn't"
631,"altered at all. You still fear the unknown, like everyone else before"
632,you. 
633, [Commander's room]
634,
635, COMMANDER: That's true! True! 
636,ZENTOS : That won't stop me from coping with it.
637,
638, [Control deck]
639,
640, STEVEN: How? By destroying us? By ejecting us into
641,space? 
642,"ZENTOS: If that is the voted finding of this hearing, yes! "
643,"MANYAK: Steven, prove to us your good faith. Would your friend, the"
644,"Doctor, have any knowledge how to deal with this fever? "
645,"STEVEN: Yes, he probably would if you'd let him out of that cell so"
646,that he had a chance to experiment. 
647,"ZENTOS: Yes, of course he would. He would love that and by such means"
648,spread the fever even further and faster. Perhaps even kill one of the
649,Guardians. Are we to be fooled by such tricks? 
650,ALL: No! 
651,ZENTOS: Are we to be taken in by such nonsense? 
652,ALL: No! 
653,ZENTOS: Do these creatures have the outward appearance of human beings?
654,
655,MAN: They are enemies. They should be punished! 
656,WOMAN: That's right! Let them be taken to the ejector chamber! They
657,must be thrown out. 
658,(The crowd all shout at once.)
659,
660, [Detention Room]
661,
662," DODO: Doctor, look at Steven. Is he all right? "
663,"DOCTOR: I hope so, my dear, I hope so. "
664,DODO: Do you think he may have caught the fever? 
665,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm afraid he may have. It appears that this virus is"
666,more virulent than I suspected.
667,
668, [Control deck]
669,
670," MANYAK: Guardians, listen to me! Guardians, listen"
671,to me! This is a court of law! 
672,ZENTOS: Let him speak! This is a fair hearing. 
673,MANYAK: My appeal for reason in this matter is simple and direct. The
674,Doctor and his companions have not denied that they brought the fever
675,"among us. They say it was an accident, and I believe them. "
676,WOMAN: But that's nonsense! 
677,MANYAK: For the simple reason that if they were in fact agents of the
678,"Refusians, they could have a achieved their objective in a much simpler"
679,way. One in which they would not have exposed themselves to this
680,danger. 
681,MAN: But they're Refusians! 
682,WOMAN: That's no argument! 
683,MANYAK: Then I have another. The fever is here. We have no answer for
684,it and it might well be that they are the only ones who can cure it. 
685,ZENTOS: Our micro-virologists may still find an answer. 
686,"MANYAK: Perhaps, but if we were to agree that the Doctor and his"
687,"friends could, what is the value in expelling them from the spaceship?"
688,
689, [Commander's room]
690,
691, COMMANDER: None at all. If Manyak and my daughter
692,"can see that, why can't they?"
693,
694, [Control deck]
695,
696," BACCU: Guardians, listen to me! I've just had news"
697,"of another disaster. One of our kind, one of the Guardians has died"
698,from the fever. 
699,ZENTOS: Do you want to hear more? Never mind the arguments of the
700,"defender because now they are nothing, now that one of our own kind had"
701,"died. So, Guardians, what is your answer to the charge? Do you find the"
702,prisoner guilty or not guilty? 
703,ALL: Guilty! 
704,ZENTOS: Is it your vote that we exact the full penalty of the special
705,Galactic law? 
706,ALL: Yes! 
707,ZENTOS: So be it! They shall be taken from this place and expelled from
708,"the ship and the privilege of execution, in that they were the first to"
709,"be struck by the fever, will be granted to the Monoids. "
710,MELLIUM: But the verdict is wrong! 
711,"MANYAK: Yes, but it is the voted verdict. There is nothing we can do"
712,about it. 
713,(Steven collapses in the cell.)
714,
715, [Detention Room]
716,
717," DODO: Doctor, something is wrong with Steven! "
718,(Steven is dragged in by two Guardians in face masks.) 
719,DOCTOR: Stop! I demand fair play. This young man is as ill as any one
720,of your own people. How do you expect him to plead in his own defence? 
721,ZENTOS : The verdict of the court was passed that you are
722,guilty.
723,
724, [Control deck]
725,
726, ZENTOS: You and your party have been condemned by
727,an overwhelming majority and your sentence is ejection into space. 
728,DOCTOR : Are you aware that you might be committing your
729,"entire community to a slow extinction? Trust me. Allow me, help me to"
730,find a new cure for this fever of yours. 
731,ZENTOS: The verdict has been given. 
732,(Zentos switches off the monitor.) 
733,ZENTOS: Well? 
734,"MANYAK: You are right, of course. "
735,"BACCU: Of course, there's no question. "
736,"MANYAK: But can we not afford to take a chance? After all, the old man"
737,"was the first to diagnose the illness. For that reason alone, he may be"
738,able to find a cure. 
739,"ZENTOS: No. Sentence will be carried out. Baccu, assemble the Monoids."
740,They may proceed. 
741,BACCU: Very well. 
742,COMMANDER : Wait! This has gone far enough.
743,
744, [Commander's room]
745,
746," COMMANDER: Zentos, this is your Commander"
747,speaking. I order you to release the travellers immediately. They will
748,be given every facility for research. They may be our only hope. See to
749,it.
750,
751, [Control deck]
752,
753," ZENTOS: But the hearing decided differently,"
754,Commander. These people are dangerous.
755,
756, [Commander's room]
757,
758," COMMANDER: Don't argue with me, Zentos. Those are"
759,"my instructions. But in case you are right, I wish the Doctor to use"
760,"his young friend as a guinea pig. If he succeeds in curing him, then I"
761,"will set aside the verdict of the court. Now, proceed. "
762,MELLIUM: Thank you father.
763,
764, [Control deck]
765,
766," ZENTOS: Very well. If he has not decided wisely,"
767,we will not live to know it.
768,
769, [Detention Room]
770,
771, DOCTOR: At last we're near a solution. We must
772,"waste no more time. Now you two, get the boy up to the table. "
773,(Two Guardians carry Steven to the table and lay him down.) 
774,"MELLIUM: Is there anything we can do to help, Doctor? "
775,"DOCTOR: Yes, cover him. We must keep him warm at once. "
776,MELLIUM: Warm? But he's already sweating with the fever in the same way
777,that my father is. 
778,"DOCTOR: My dear young lady, please do as you're told. Now, where is"
779,that other young woman I want? 
780,"DODO: Here I am, Doctor. "
781,"DOCTOR: Oh good, now look here. Go to the Tardis and bring these things"
782,"back for me, will you? "
783,(The Doctor gives Dodo a piece of paper.) 
784,MELLIUM: Will these do? 
785,"DOCTOR: Yes, certainly, fine, fine. "
786,DODO: How will I know where to find them? 
787,"DOCTOR: Well open your eyes, my dear child, otherwise you won't be any"
788,"use to me, will you? "
789,DODO: Okay. 
790,DOCTOR: What did you say? 
791,"DODO: I said, okay. "
792,"DOCTOR: Yes, I thought you did. Now once this crisis is over, I'm going"
793,to teach you to speak English. 
794,BACCU: I shall go with her. 
795,"DOCTOR: Right, off you go. "
796,(Dodo and Baccu leave.) 
797,"RHOS: Doctor, our virologists are willing to give you all the help you"
798,need. Can you describe the virus responsible? 
799,"DOCTOR: Yes, I "
800,MELLIUM: I've wrapped Steven warmly. Is there anything else I can do? 
801,"DOCTOR: Yes, now I want you to find all the sick people in this"
802,spaceship and give them the same treatment. 
803,MELLIUM: You mean keep them warm? 
804,"DOCTOR: Exactly, my child. Yes. "
805,MELLIUM: Very well. 
806,"DOCTOR: Oh, and my child? "
807,MELLIUM: Doctor? 
808,DOCTOR: That also includes your father. 
809,(Mellium leaves.) 
810,"DOCTOR: Now, this germ. This germ is "
811, [Control deck]
812,
813," (Dodo, Baccu and their Monoid guards return with"
814,the items on the list.) 
815,RHOS: The vaccine was used as long ago as the twentieth century and
816,then was lost in the time of the primal wars. 
817,BACCU: Is that what he's trying to find now? The old vaccine? 
818,"RHOS: Yes, he says it's a natural compound derived from animal"
819,membranes. We only need to take single specimens and then we can
820,release the animals again. But it means that a large scale hunt has to
821,be organised out there in the jungle. 
822,BACCU: leave that to me. I'll collect a party of Guardians and Monoids.
823,Tell us what animals you need. 
824,"RHOS: Well, we need two "
825, [Jungle]
826,
827, (The hunt takes place. One Monoid sees to a
828,near-unconscious elephant whilst another deals with a lizard.)
829,
830, [Detention Room]
831,
832," DOCTOR: Yes, I know I'm a bit of a quack, but the"
833,"combination of these two membrane fluids, a little at a time, should do"
834,the trick. 
835,(The Monoid passes a test tube without being asked.) 
836,"DOCTOR: Ah, thank you, thank you. You know, you're far more"
837,"knowledgeable than most people realise, aren't you? "
838,(The Doctor puts his concoction into the test tube.) 
839,"DOCTOR: Now, my dear Dodo, how is he? "
840,"DODO: He's conscious, Doctor, but only just. Are you going to try it"
841,now? 
842,"DOCTOR: Well, I don't see why not, yes. Now where is that sterilised"
843,postule? 
844,(The Monoid brings the tray of test tubes.) 
845,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you, thank you, yes. You know, I don't know what I"
846,would do without you. 
847,DODO: Do you really think it'll work? 
848,"DOCTOR: Well, I don't see why not, my dear, providing I've mixed these"
849,properly. 
850,DODO: And what if you haven't? 
851,"DOCTOR: Oh, don't let that cross our minds, for heavens sake. Now then,"
852,here we are. 
853,(He puts the patch on Steven's arm.) 
854,DODO: Don't you have to squirt it into his arm? 
855,"DOCTOR: What, with a hypodermic needle? Good gracious, no. That went"
856,out a long time ago. There we are. Now all we have to do is to wait and
857,watch. Come along. 
858,DODO: Where are you going? 
859,DOCTOR: I'm going to treat the others precisely the same way as I've
860,treated Steven. 
861,"DODO: Isn't that a bit dodgy? I mean, he was supposed to be the guinea"
862,"pig, wasn't he? "
863,"DOCTOR: Well it's going to be much dodgier my child, as you say, if I"
864,just sat and did nothing. Come along. 
865,(The Doctor and the Monoid leave)
866,
867, [Commander's room]
868,
869,(The Doctor puts a patch on the Commander's
870,forearm.) 
871,DOCTOR: There now. Just relax and rest. 
872,MELLIUM: Is there anything further I can do? 
873,"DOCTOR: No, it's just a matter of time, my dear. Come along."
874,
875, [Control deck]
876,
877, MANYAK: How long must we wait? 
878,"BACCU: They weren't sure. Apparently once the injection has been given,"
879,there's no way to hurry the response of the patient. 
880,"MANYAK: Zentos is waiting like a vulture, just in case the treatment"
881,doesn't work. 
882, [Detention Room]
883,
884,(Steven is tossing and turning.) 
885,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think I've given him the right treatment. "
886,"DODO: Doctor, it's along time now since you gave him that stuff and the"
887,fever only seems to be getting worse. 
888,"DOCTOR: Well, it's about an hour, my dear. He seems to be reacting"
889,"quite normally. Yes, he's fighting it. "
890,(Then Steven goes limp.) 
891,DODO: Has something gone wrong? 
892,DOCTOR: The fever's down and the temperature's dropped. 
893,DODO: You mean? 
894,"DOCTOR: I mean he's going to be all right, my dear. "
895,(Dodo runs out.)
896,
897, [Control deck]
898,
899, DODO: It's all right! Steven's much better.
900,Everything's going to be all right! 
901,MANYAK: I told you it would be. 
902,"DOCTOR: You have nothing further to worry about, sir. The sick have"
903,been tended to and the others immunised against further attack. 
904,"ZENTOS: Thank you, Doctor. So you were right after all. "
905,"DODO: Doctor, the Commander's fever's gone down, so he's going to be"
906,all right. 
907,"DOCTOR: Oh, splendid, splendid. "
908,BACCU: Look! The scan of Earth! 
909,(On the screen the planet looks more like a comet.) 
910,ZENTOS: The last moment has come. 
911,"(Later, by the base of the statue.) "
912,"DOCTOR: Now, you can continue with the building of your statue and when"
913,"it's finished, I'm sure it's going to look very beautiful. "
914,"MELLIUM: Yes, our descendants will know its meaning when they put the"
915,finishing touches to it. 
916,STEVEN: In seven hundred years time. 
917,"MELLIUM: Yes, in seven hundred years time. "
918,"DOCTOR: Well, we must be off. Goodbye, sir. "
919,COMMANDER: Goodbye. 
920,"DOCTOR: Goodbye, my dear. "
921,"MELLIUM: Goodbye, Doctor. "
922,DODO: Goodbye. 
923,COMMANDER: Goodbye. 
924,"ZENTOS: Doctor, for the fact that I mistrusted you, misjudged you, I'm"
925,sorry. 
926,"DOCTOR: Remember your journey is very important, young man, therefore"
927,"you must travel with understanding as well as hope. Goodbye, Zentos. "
928,ZENTOS: Goodbye Doctor. 
929,(The Doctor gets on board a tractor unit with Steven and Dodo on the
930,"rear, and a Monoid drives them off to )"
931,
932, [Jungle]
933,
934," (At the Tardis, everyone goes in and it"
935,dematerialises before the Monoid drives away.) 
936,"(Later, the Tardis re-materialises.) "
937,DODO : Can I go out now? 
938,"DOCTOR: You really must let me go first, child. "
939,(The Doctor steps out) 
940,"DOCTOR: Oh. Well, that's strange. Something must have gone wrong. It"
941,appears we've landed back in the same place. 
942,STEVEN: How? 
943,"DOCTOR: Take a look at this, my boy. Isn't it extraordinary? Well, now,"
944,that's inexplicable. 
945, [Control deck]
946,
947," DODO: Mellium! Baccu! They can't be far away, can"
948,they? 
949,STEVEN: I don't know. It depends on how long ago it was. 
950,DODO: What? 
951,"STEVEN: Look, there's nobody here, is there? "
952,DODO: We've only been gone a few seconds. Mellium! Baccu! 
953,(Dodo runs off.) 
954,"DODO: Doctor, Steven, look! "
955,"DOCTOR: What is it, my dear? What have you found? "
956,(Dodo is at the base of statue) 
957,DODO: The statue. They've finished the statue. 
958,"(But the head of the statue isn't human, it's Monoid.)"
959,
960, Episode Three - The
961,Return 
962, [Control deck]
963,
964," DODO: What happened? The head, it wasn't meant to"
965,be like that. 
966,STEVEN: No. It was meant to be a human being. Now it's a Monoid. Wonder
967,why? 
968,(There are leaves on the floor and weeds over the equipment.) 
969,"DOCTOR: Well I'm not sure, dear boy. However, the statue's finished."
970,That means seven hundred years must have passed since we�last stood
971,here. 
972,DODO: Is that why the place looks so grotty? 
973,STEVEN: Must be. 
974,DODO: But we've only been gone a few seconds. 
975,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know, my dear. It's pretty hard for you to understand. "
976,"STEVEN: Yes, well the Guardians said it would take seven hundred years"
977,for this spaceship to reach the planet Refusis Two. If that navigation
978,chart's anything to go by I'd say that they're almost there. 
979,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think you're right. "
980,"STEVEN: Then where are the Guardians? Well, at least the descendants of"
981,"those we knew before. Surely they should be here, guiding the ship? "
982,"DOCTOR: I don't think that will be necessary, dear boy. It appears"
983,they've introduced some form of automatic guiding device. 
984,"STEVEN: Yes, but you'd think one of them would be standing by to make"
985,sure nothing goes wrong. 
986,"DOCTOR: Yes, well now, let's have a look at the scanner and see if that"
987,may help. 
988,STEVEN: Well that's the room with the Earth's population stored in
989,microform. 
990,(The image changes to show a man holding a glass of liquid.) 
991,DODO: It's one of the Guardians. 
992,(The man puts the glass down and a hand waves him away. He bows.) 
993,STEVEN: That looks like a Monoid. 
994,"DODO: Yes, but the Guardian's working as a kind of servant. "
995,"DOCTOR: Yes, he's not the only one who's doing that. "
996,STEVEN: Looks like some kind of kitchen. 
997,"DODO: Yes and they're sort of slaves, aren't they?"
998,
999, [Kitchen]
1000,
1001," (A man knocks a bowl off the edge of a table, and"
1002,a gas is fired at him. He clutches his hand in pain.)
1003,
1004, [Control deck]
1005,
1006, DODO: What was that? 
1007,STEVEN: Looked like some kind of gun. 
1008,DODO: But the arm? 
1009,"DOCTOR: Yes, it appears the Monoids have become overlords. "
1010,"STEVEN: Doctor, look! "
1011,(Three Monoids and two Guardians have entered. The Monoids have collars
1012,with numbers on and are armed. They speak via a device in the collar.) 
1013,MONOID 2: Who are you? 
1014,STEVEN: Things have obviously changed. 
1015,DODO: He can speak. They couldn't before. 
1016,"MONOID 2: I asked, who are you? Where did you come from? "
1017,DOCTOR: We are visitors to this spaceship. We were here many centuries
1018,ago. We come as friends. 
1019,MONOID 2: Friends to whom? 
1020,DOCTOR: To all who�travel in this spaceship. 
1021,MONOID 2: You mean of the humanoids like yourself. 
1022,"DOCTOR: Well, er, yes. But when we were here some time ago we also were"
1023,friends of your forebears. They were called Monoids. Things were very
1024,different then. 
1025,"YENDOM: These strangers, they "
1026,MONOID 2: You speak of the distant past. Following the recent
1027,revolution we are now the masters. 
1028,"DOCTOR: I see, and the human beings? "
1029,"MONOID 2: They work for us. Is that not true, Yendom? "
1030,YENDOM: Yes. 
1031,"MONOID 2: We conquered and you obey. And these strangers, they will"
1032,also obey. Now you will come with us. 
1033,STEVEN: Where? 
1034,MONOID 2: To our leader 
1035,
1036, [Monoid's chamber]
1037,
1038,(The Monoid we saw being served a glass of drink
1039,has finished it.) 
1040,"MONOID 2: Here are the strangers, One. "
1041,MONOID 1: Wait. Look. 
1042,(On a monitor is the scene of the travellers being driven to the Tardis
1043,at the end of episode two.) 
1044,MONOID 1: It seems that when you were here before the Guardians of that
1045,day didn't believe that you could travel through time as well as space.
1046,Why have you come back? 
1047,STEVEN: The Tardis made the decision. 
1048,MONOID 1: Are you telling me that you can't control your own machine? 
1049,DODO: What's it got to do with you? 
1050,"DOCTOR: Shush, child. "
1051,MONOID 1: According to the history scan you brought a strange fever
1052,that killed many of our ancestors. 
1053,"DODO: But we also helped to find a cure, didn't we? I mean, the Doctor"
1054,did. 
1055,MONOID 1: He thought he did. 
1056,DOCTOR: And what do you mean by that? 
1057,"MONOID 1: You controlled the immediate impact of the fever, but a"
1058,mutation of it developed later on that sapped the will of the humans. 
1059,DODO: You mean that it was our fault that you took over because of the
1060,fever? 
1061,MONOID 1: In part. 
1062,STEVEN: There were other reasons? 
1063,MONOID 1: The main reason was the Guardians themselves. They were a
1064,simple people. They actually encouraged the research from which we
1065,developed our voice boxes and heat prods. They were totally unprepared
1066,for the conflict when it came. 
1067,DODO: What happened to them? 
1068,MONOID 1: Many were killed. The rest are prisoners. A fact that you
1069,"will shortly see for yourselves! Two, take them away to the security"
1070,kitchen and then call a Grand Council. 
1071,MONOID 2: This way. 
1072,(The travellers leave.) 
1073,"MONOID 1: I trust that their return won't give you any ideas, Maharis? "
1074,MAHARIS: No. I am content to obey. 
1075, [Kitchen]
1076,
1077, DASSUK: Who told you? 
1078,VENUSSA: One of the subject Guardians whispered it as he passed by the
1079,"door, just now. "
1080,DASSUK: Strangers? What sort of strangers? 
1081,VENUSSA: Human beings! 
1082,"DASSUK: Well, I'm afraid the Monoids will make very short work of them."
1083,
1084,"VENUSSA: Well, no, they've been taken prisoner. "
1085,"DASSUK: Well, that proves it's only a rumour. Just like all the other"
1086,"rumours we've been hearing. Look Venussa, you know how far the Ark has"
1087,"travelled and the Earth itself no longer exists, so where could these"
1088,so-called humans come from? 
1089,"VENUSSA: From Earth, but as it was millions of years ago. Well, they"
1090,travel through time. 
1091,DASSUK: That's impossible. I think you've been a prisoner a little too
1092,long. 
1093,"VENUSSA: Oh, but it could be true, Dassuk. Oh, don't you remember the"
1094,story? Hundreds of years ago a doctor and a young couple came and then
1095,went away again. Well they were the first people to call this ship the
1096,Ark! 
1097,DASSUK: That's just a legend. And legends won't help us regain control
1098,of the Ark. 
1099,"MONOID 2: All right, Doctor, this way, and bring your friends with you."
1100,
1101,VENUSSA: Doctor? 
1102,MONOID 2: You will stay in this place and help with the task of
1103,preparing our food. You will sleep here like the others of your kind.
1104,"Above all else, you must always be obedient prisoners. "
1105,(Monoid 2 leaves.) 
1106,VENUSSA: Doctor? Did he say Doctor? Have you been here before? 
1107,"STEVEN: Yes, we have. "
1108,"DASSUK: But, but that's incredible! How in space could you do it? "
1109,"DOCTOR: If I were to tell you, young man, you wouldn't believe me. "
1110,"STEVEN: No, besides we've got far more important things to talk about."
1111,We've got to find a way to get out of this place. 
1112, [Control deck]
1113,
1114," MONOID 1: In a short while, Refusis will be ours."
1115,We will land there. We will create a Monoid world. 
1116,"MONOID 3: But One, what about the Guardians? "
1117,MONOID 1: I have a simple plan that will destroy them. When we start
1118,our life on that planet it will be with no reference of any kind to the
1119,time when we were secondary beings! 
1120,MONOID 2: That's as it should be. 
1121,MONOID 1: But at this moment we cannot be sure of what Refusis is
1122,"really like, or what kind of creatures the Refusians are. "
1123,MONOID 2: That's true. 
1124,MONOID 1: So I am sending a forward landing party ahead of us. 
1125,MONOID 3: But in that case the Refusians will be forewarned. 
1126,MONOID 1: I have thought of that. Listen. 
1127,
1128, [Kitchen]
1129,
1130, (Dassuk puts some powder into a pot of water and
1131,almost immediately the water turns into boiled potatoes.) 
1132,DODO: I named this ship The Ark. They'd never heard the name 'til I
1133,used it. 
1134,DASSUK: And you brought a strange new fever and then the Doctor cured
1135,it. 
1136,"VENUSSA: Of course. Take no notice of him, Doctor, he was born a cynic."
1137,
1138,DOCTOR: He'll probably die one unless we do something quickly about
1139,this situation. 
1140,"STEVEN: Listen, are there many other Guardians like yourselves held"
1141,prisoner? 
1142,"DASSUK: Oh, not many. The Monoids only keep us alive because they enjoy"
1143,being waited on. 
1144,DODO: Why don't you just jump on them? They're pretty slow moving
1145,"creatures, Monoids. "
1146,DASSUK: You forget they're armed and we're not. And those heat prods
1147,can be pretty lethal. 
1148,"STEVEN: Right, but we could take the chance and seize one. Challenge"
1149,them at their own game. 
1150,"DASSUK: No, they're too careful. They never put them down. "
1151,"DOCTOR: Yes, we shall have to be pretty urgent too. Time is running"
1152,out. 
1153, [Control deck]
1154,
1155, MONOID 1: While the others are preparing the
1156,"launcher, go and get the Doctor and the girl. "
1157,"MONOID 2: Yes, One."
1158,
1159, [Kitchen]
1160,
1161, DODO: Do you think you can do it? 
1162,DASSUK: We must try. Otherwise 
1163,DODO: What? 
1164,"DASSUK: There'll be no future for us, and our forefathers might just as"
1165,well've stayed on the Earth and died with it. 
1166,VENUSSA: They're coming back. 
1167,(Monoid 2 enters) 
1168,MONOID 2: What is this? Why aren't you working? 
1169,(Venussa knocks over a pot. Monoid 2 steps towards her.) 
1170,STEVEN: Now! 
1171,(Steven and Dassuk tackle Monoid 2 but have not got his weapon when
1172,Monoid 3 enters.) 
1173,MONOID 3: Back! 
1174,"(Monoid 3 kills a man, and Steven and Dassuk let go.) "
1175,MONOID 2: Get back. You are reckless and stupid. Now you have gained
1176,"only one thing, the death of another of your kind. Doctor! You and the"
1177,girl will come with me. 
1178,(Steven tries to follow.) 
1179,MONOID 2: You stay here. 
1180,STEVEN: Why? Where are you taking them? 
1181,MONOID 2: They will make the first landing on the planet Refusis. You
1182,will be held as a security for their conduct. 
1183, [Control deck]
1184,
1185," MONOID 3: The launcher is ready, One. The Doctor,"
1186,"the girl, the Guardian and Two are aboard. "
1187,MONOID 1: Good. Then let's hope that they succeed in their mission. 
1188,(The cylindrical module sets off towards the planet.) 
1189, [Launcher]
1190,
1191," (They land, and the door opens.) "
1192,MONOID 2: Out.

1194, [Refusis Jungle]
1195,
1196,"(The Doctor goes first, followed by Dodo, Yendom"
1197,and Monoid 2.) 
1198,"DODO: So this is Refusis? Where's the red carpet, then? "
1199,"MONOID 2: Perhaps the Refusians are hidden somewhere. If so, we must"
1200,find them. Move carefully and don't forget that I am still armed. 
1201,(Yendom leads the way.) 
1202, [Launcher] 
1203, A cushion sags as if an invisible person has sat
1204,"on it, levers are moved and the door closes.) "
1205,VOICE: Hmm. 
1206,(The door opens again and the cushion springs up again.)
1207,
1208, [Refusis Jungle]
1209,
1210, MONOID 2: Still no sign of life. Perhaps the audio
1211,space research that told us of the Refusians was wrong. 
1212,DOCTOR: Let us return to the launcher and send a message back to the
1213,Ark. Tell them they can make their landings quite safely. I'm sure
1214,they'll be extremely delighted to hear it. 
1215,"DODO: Yes, I bet it'll take some time to get the whole of the"
1216,"population down here, so the sooner you get started, the better, I"
1217,should think. 
1218,MONOID 2: Don't worry. It may not take as long as you think. 
1219,DODO: What do you mean? Are you up to something? 
1220,"MONOID 2: Er, no. "
1221,"DODO: No? But you gave yourself away, didn't you? I've got a feeling"
1222,when the time comes you're not going to bring the Guardians down here
1223,"at all, is that it? "
1224,YENDOM: But they promised! 
1225,"DODO: I don't care. I'm right, aren't I? "
1226,"DOCTOR: We were all wrong. This place is inhabited. Come, see for"
1227,yourselves. 
1228,"(A few steps on, they look down into a valley and see a heavily arcaded"
1229,building with spires.) 
1230,DODO: It's a sort of a castle! MONOID 2: Why didn't the Refusians see
1231,the launcher arrive or make any moves to stop us? 
1232,DOCTOR: Shall we find out? 
1233,MONOID 2: Proceed. 
1234,"(As the party moves on, a plant suddenly twitches.)"
1235,
1236, [Refusis Castle]
1237,
1238, (The Doctor enters a reception room with a tiled
1239,floor and a potted plant by the door. More flowers in a vase on a
1240,table.) 
1241,MONOID 2: It's deserted. 
1242,(A curtained inner door slams.) 
1243,DOCTOR: Strange. Strange indeed. 
1244,MONOID 2: There is no one in there. 
1245,DOCTOR: How can you be so sure? 
1246,MONOID 2: They must be hiding somewhere. They are just frightened
1247,creatures. 
1248,DODO: I don't like it. This place is dead weird. 
1249,YENDOM: What do you mean? 
1250,"DODO: Oh, it's just a feeling I've got. "
1251,MONOID 2: I would like to see the faces of these Refusians. 
1252,"DODO: Not sure I would. If they're anything like you, I've seen enough."
1253,
1254,MONOID 2: What the? 
1255,"DODO: Oh, nothing. "
1256,MONOID 2: I will challenge them like this! 
1257,(It smashes an empty vase on the floor.) 
1258,"DODO: Oh, no! "
1259,(Then the flowers.) 
1260,MONOID 2: They must be in this place somewhere. When they hear what I'm
1261,doing. 
1262,(It picks up the other vase.) 
1263,DOCTOR: Put that thing down! That is no way to establish friendship! 
1264,"MONOID 2: The sooner they learn to respect us, the better. "
1265,REFUSIAN : Your friend is right! Put it down. 
1266,MONOID 2: Where did that come from? 
1267,YENDOM: I think from out there. 
1268,"DODO: No, it came from the direction of that room. "
1269,MONOID 2: Where are you? Show yourself or I will smash 
1270,REFUSIAN : I warned you! Put that down. 
1271,DOCTOR: I think it comes from within this room. 
1272,"MONOID 2: Nonsense. If the Refusian seeks to challenge me, I will"
1273,accept it. 
1274,REFUSIAN : You have been warned! 
1275,(Something seizes the Monoid's arm and forces the vase back onto the
1276,table.) 
1277,REFUSIAN : Thank you. 
1278,(The flowers put back into the vase.) 
1279,"REFUSIAN : As your friend said, I'm here in the room with you. "

1284,(By the statue.) 
1285,MONOID 1: They must've landed by now. We should be getting a report
1286,from Two. 
1287,"MONOID 3: Yes, One. "
1288,(He sends 34 away.) 
1289,MONOID 3: What was the plan you had for destroying the Guardians and
1290,this spaceship? 
1291,"MONOID 1: A short while after we leave, they will disappear in a cloud"
1292,of fragmented pieces. 
1293,MONOID 3: You mean a bomb of some kind? 
1294,MONOID 1: A fission device. I had it made secretly and it is ready to
1295,be detonated at any time. 
1296,MONOID 3: But where is it? 
1297,(One points up at the statue.) 
1298,"MONOID 3: Excellent, One. "
1299,MONOID 1: The last place they would think of looking.

1302,
1303,(Maheris is spying on his masters.) 
1304,"MONOID 1 : That is, if they even suspect its presence"
1305,before it goes off. 
1306,MONOID 3 : Why should they? Then that will be the end of
1307,all human existence.

1309, [Kitchen]
1310,
1311,(Another pot of food is made just by dropping
1312,powder into the water.) 
1313,MAHARIS: I bring you news. 
1314,STEVEN: Why does everyone back away from him? 
1315,VENUSSA: Because he's one of the subject Guardians. What you'd call a
1316,collaborator. 
1317,DASSUK: And what does your news amount to? How much can we trust you? 
1318,MAHARIS: But you must. It's important! 
1319,VENUSSA: Go back to your masters. 
1320,MAHARIS: What I have to say concerns us all. 
1321,STEVEN: Perhaps we should listen. 
1322,VENUSSA: No! He speaks with the voice of the Monoids. 
1323,MAHARIS: No longer! They intend to betray us all. Even those of us
1324,who've worked for them. 
1325,STEVEN: How? 
1326,MAHARIS: They plan to leave us behind when they land on Refusis. 
1327,VENUSSA: Would you've expected anything else? 
1328,"MAHARIS: But there's more. When they go, they'll leave a device behind"
1329,that will destroy the Ark and everything in it. 
1330,STEVEN: Are you sure of this? 
1331,MAHARIS: Yes! I overheard One telling another Monoid. 
1332,STEVEN: Do you know where the device is? 
1333,"MAHARIS: No. I only heard them talking, I couldn't see where One"
1334,pointed. 
1335,DASSUK: Then somehow we shall have to find out.

1338,
1339,"(The Doctor is sitting at the table, talking with"
1340,his invisible host.) 
1341,"DOCTOR: And that was their aim, to land there and recreate life on this"
1342,planet. 
1343,REFUSIAN [OC]: Yes. We've known for some time of the journey of the
1344,vessel you call the Ark and we welcomed it. That is why we built places
1345,like this. 
1346,DOCTOR: I see. Just to make us comfortable? I didn't think you needed
1347,places like this for yourselves. 
1348,REFUSIAN : No. Once we had a shape and form something like you.
1349,"Then there was a galaxy accident. A giant solar flare. Now, we no"

1351,DOCTOR: But can you see each other? 
1352,"REFUSIAN : Not even that. Oh, we can sense one other but that is"
1353,all. That is why it would have been good for Refusis to be inhabited
1354,"again by life and the signs of life, provided that the beings that come"
1355,"to take our place are peaceful. Child, you are worried. "
1356,DODO: I think I can hear them coming back. 
1357, [Refusis Jungle]
1358,
1359, MONOID 2: We must return to the launcher. We must
1360,warn One and the others so that we can prepare to deal with these
1361,unseen creatures. 
1362,"YENDOM: We, meaning only the Monoids. When you spoke of it before you"
1363,"meant that only you and only your kind would make the landings, didn't"
1364,you. 
1365,"MONOID 2: Yendom, I do not have to account to you. "
1366,YENDOM: I'll not let you contact them. 
1367,"MONOID 2: Yendom, stay where you are! "
1368,"(Yendom and the Two struggle, but Yendom falls and gets shot. Two goes"
1369,"into the launcher. Shortly afterwards, the Doctor and Dodo find"
1370,Yendom's body.) 
1371,DODO: What about the Monoid? Do you think he's gone back to the
1372,launcher? 
1373,REFUSIAN : We'll soon see.

1409, MONOID 3: What has happened? Why does Two no
1410,longer give us his report? 
1411,"MONOID 1: I don't know. It could mean a simple break in communications,"
1412,or that he was attacked! 
1413,MONOID 3: But his report of conditions on the planet Refusis started
1414,favourably. 
1415,MONOID 1: Yes. 
1416,"MONOID 3: Then what do we do, One? "
1417,MONOID 1: We will proceed with our plans. We will prepare ourselves for
1418,the main landings. 
1419,MONOID 3: One has spoken. Get the launchers ready and prepare the
1420,Monoid population trays for the journey. 
1421,"MONOID 4: (to 6) The leader has said that we must go, but supposing he"
1422,is wrong? We still don't know what Refusis is like. 
1423,"MONOID 1: At last, a new planet of our own where we can establish our"
1424,own way of life. 
1425,"MONOID 3: Yes, One. But a word of warning. "
1426,MONOID 1: What's that? 
1427,MONOID 3: Four is beginning to question the wisdom of your leadership. 
1428,"MONOID 1: Don't worry. At the slightest sign of opposition, we can"
1429,"easily get rid of him. As easily as we will this spaceship, once we"
1430,"have left it. Remember, the final answer which is locked in the head of"

1435,concerned about the arrival of the Ark and what it will mean to this
1436,planet. 
1437,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I can quite understand that. That is why you"
1438,destroyed the Launcher? 
1439,"REFUSIAN : Here, we've always known peace. Never war or conflict. "
1440,"DODO: You're not the only ones like that. The Guardians, you know the"
1441,"humans who travel in the spaceship, they have used to have your ideas"
1442,too. 
1443,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's true my dear but, you mustn't think they were"
1444,"perfect. Oh, no. Sometimes they were extremely intolerant and selfish. "
1445,REFUSIAN : Is that why they were conquered by the Monoids? 
1446,DOCTOR: Exactly. 
1447,"DODO: Yes, I know. But there are some of them left who wouldn't mind"
1448,rising up against the Monoids and trying to do better. 
1449,REFUSIAN : Then we will allow them time to make their attempt. We
1450,will wait for the passing of one day before we think in terms of
1451,employing defensive measures. 
1452,DOCTOR: Yes. One day. Thank you.

1454,"DOCTOR: Quite so, my dear. Quite so."

1459,rushing about all over the place. 
1460,VENUSSA: Do you think they're preparing to leave the Ark? 
1461,DASSUK: Probably. 
1462,"STEVEN: Look, isn't there a way to get out of this kitchen? "
1463,VENUSSA: None. The walls are thick and the doors only open from the
1464,outside. 
1465,"STEVEN: Well, who opens it? "
1466,"DASSUK: Well, they do. Sometimes one of the subject Guardians. Maharis,"
1467,for instance. 
1468,STEVEN: Then we must get him to help us. 
1469,VENUSSA: He won't. He's too frightened. 
1470,STEVEN: All right. Then we'll have to use his help without his knowing
1471,it.

1485,MAHARIS: Yes. One. 
1486,(Maharis leaves with the tray.) 
1487,"MONOID 1: Stupid, trusting creature. He and all the other subject"
1488,Guardians are still under the illusion that they will be coming with us
1489,to Refusis. 
1490,MONOID 3: They are a blind people. They deserve their fate. 
1491,MONOID 1: Yes. What were you going to say? 
1492,MONOID 3: I was reporting that the preparation of the launchers is
1493,proceeding satisfactorily.

1502,(Steven takes him to one side while Dassuk goes for the open door) 
1503,STEVEN: And you still think they'll take you? 
1504,MAHARIS: Why not? We can serve them on Refusis as well as here. Just a
1505,moment. Where's Dassuk?

1514,VENUSSA: What first? 
1515,"STEVEN: Well, we agreed. First we've got to find that bomb that the"
1516,Monoids left behind. 
1517, [Control deck]
1518,
1519," MONOID 4: The moment we land, then we decide"

1523,MONOID 1: Never mind that. We will now go there ourselves. Give the
1524,signal. 
1525,(An alarm sounds.)

1551,this planet is ours! 
1552,MONOID 3: Look. 
1553,(They go to the destroyed lander.) 
1554,MONOID 3: There is the reason why Two failed to complete his message to
1555,us. 
1556,MONOID 1: A reason and a warning. We must find who destroyed that
1557,"launcher, and then destroy them! "
1558,(The Doctor and Dodo watch One and Three leave.) 
1559,MONOID 4: One made a mistake in bringing us here. We will have to wait
1560,"for our chance, then challenge him and return to the Ark. There is"
1561,still time before it is destroyed by that bomb that has been left
1562,behind. Come. We must not let One and the others get out of our sight. 
1563,(The rest of the Monoids leave.)

1571,VENUSSA: We'll find it. We must! 
1572,STEVEN: What's that? 
1573,VENUSSA: It's one of the launchers trying to make contact. We're in
1574,contact. Who is that?

1595,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm glad you heard that. You know, these launchers are"
1596,"simple to operate and I would like to suggest, my friend, that you fly"
1597,them back to the Ark. 
1598,REFUSIAN : Me? 
1599,"DOCTOR: Yes, the Monoids won't know who's taking them. And as for me"

1623,"STEVEN: Look, there's no point standing around moping just because the"
1624,Monoids promise you something and then failed you. You've got to do
1625,something to save yourself.

1632, [Launcher]
1633,

1640," MONOID 1: Doctor, where are the Refusians? "
1641,DOCTOR: I don't know. I haven't seen one. 
1642,"MONOID 1: You step out of the launcher, a moment later it was flown"
1643,away. It must have been manned by someone. I must find the answer. 
1644,"MONOID 3: Do you think they will talk, One? "
1645,"MONOID 1: If they don't, they will die. "
1646,MONOID 4: Perhaps. But it would seem that we will die as well. 
1647,"MONOID 1: Do you seek to challenge me, Four? "
1648,MONOID 4: You have led us to this planet and placed us all in danger. 
1649,"MONOID 1: If that is the way you feel, then return to the Ark. "
1650,MONOID 4: We will. Only there we have to face the danger that you
1651,created. The fission device. 
1652,"MONOID 1: Leaving you with but one problem, that of getting rid of it."
1653,"But since it is inside the statue, and the statue itself is so heavy, I"
1654,think that you will find the problem of disposal is not so easy. 
1655,"MONOID 4: Those of you that wish to stay in this world of the unknown,"
1656,will side with One. But those who care for the future of the Monoids
1657,must come with me.

1665,
1666, [Control deck]
1667,
1668," STEVEN: Well, I think we should split up. Some of"
1669,"us should go back to Refusis to help the Doctor and Dodo, whilst the"
1670,rest stay here and try to deal with that bomb. 
1671,"DASSUK: Yes, that's a good idea. "
1672,MAHARIS: Is it? Why should any of us stay and risk being blown up? 
1673,"STEVEN: Because the Earth's population trays, everything else that"
1674,"represents Earth life, all these things have to be taken to Refusis"
1675,later. 
1676,VENUSSA: Steven's right. That's why our forefathers started this voyage
1677,"through space in the first place, seven hundred years ago. "
1678,MAHARIS: But we're alive. Why should any of us die for an idea that
1679,they thought of? 
1680,"VENUSSA: You've served too long with the Monoids, Maharis. You no"
1681,longer belong to us. Let him go with the landing party. 
1682,"STEVEN: Yes, all right. Dassuk, you take the launcher. Go with him,"
1683,Maharis. And you two. Contact the Doctor as soon as you can. I'll stay
1684,here.

1686,VENUSSA: I'll stay too. 
1687,DASSUK: Right. 
1688,(Dassuk leaves.) 
1689,STEVEN: You could have gone with them. 
1690,VENUSSA: They don't need me. You don't know the Ark. You will need me

1700,MONOID 4: Your orders? You have given too many and delivered them

1774,VENUSSA: What's that? 
1775,REFUSIAN : Make peace with the Monoids. 
1776,"DOCTOR: He's right. A long time ago, your ancestors accepted"
