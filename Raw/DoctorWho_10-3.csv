20,One 
21, [Spaceship Bridge] 
22, (A utilitarian space ship is travelling between
23,star systems. One of its crew reports back to base.) 
24,HARDY: This is Earth cargo ship C982 on course and on schedule. We
25,shall be entering hyperspace in fifty seconds. 
26,STEWART: Do you know what I'd like? 
27,HARDY: What? 
28,STEWART: A job on one of those luxury space liners. First Officer on
29,"the Mars Venus cruise, that'd suit me. "
30,"HARDY: You can keep it. Spit and polish, cocktail parties and all those"
31,passengers? 
32,"STEWART: Gold braid uniform, beautiful stewardesses? Yeah, I'd take"
33,that any time. 
34,HARDY: You'll more likely wind up pushing a battle cruiser. 
35,STEWART: There's not going to be an interplanetary war. 
36,HARDY: Didn't you see the videocast last night? The President of
37,Earth's government deplores the Draconian attack on two of Earth's
38,cargo vessels. 
39,"STEWART: Look, they steal a few of our cargoes, we steal a few of"
40,"theirs. It'll all blow over. Right, we're ready for the jump. "
41,(Stewart straps himself in.) 
42,"HARDY: Preparing to enter hyperspace at twenty two oh nine seventy two,"
43,"two thousand, five hundred and forty EST. Right. "
44,STEWART: Right. 
45,(The spaceship hurtles forward. A little while later...) 
46,"HARDY: Hey look, a ship. "
47,STEWART: That thing's not a ship! 
48,"(No, it's a materialising Tardis on the main monitor.) "
49,HARDY: It's going to hit us! 
50,STEWART: Pulling out of hyperspace now at twenty two thirteen seven two
51,seven two four zero! 
52,STEWART: Phew! That was a close thing. 
53,(The engine noise stops and the Tardis disappears from the monitor.) 
54,HARDY: It vanished. It just vanished. 
55,STEWART: You'd better report it. 
56,HARDY: Mysterious object sighted during hyperspace transition. Object
57,resembled large box with flashing light on top. Object disappeared
58,before collision. Present whereabouts unknown.
59,
60, [Spaceship cargo hold]
61,
62, (The Tardis has materialised in an open area with
63,a short flight of steps out to a passageway. Jo comes storming out.) 
64,"JO: Well, I'm never going in that thing again. "
65,"DOCTOR: Oh, come on, Jo, be reasonable. "
66,JO: Only you could manage to have a traffic accident in space. 
67,"DOCTOR: Well, we didn't hit it, did we? "
68,JO: Didn't we? Where's this then? 
69,"DOCTOR: Well, by a rather brilliant last minute course correction, I've"
70,managed to materialise the Tardis inside the spaceship. But to avoid
71,"hitting it, I've had to make a random jump back into normal space. "
72,"JO: Terrific, but what do we do now? "
73,"DOCTOR: Well, if I'm going to get us back to Earth, I'd better find out"
74,where we are. I'll just go and check the instruments. 
75,(The Doctor goes into the Tardis. Jo reads the labels on the large
76,hoppers around the hold.) 
77,"JO: Hmm, they're carrying bulk flour. "
78,DOCTOR : What? 
79,JO: They're carrying a cargo of bulk flour. 
80,(She walks over to a porthole and sees another spaceship nearby. There
81,is a sudden blinding flash accompanied by a piercing noise. A different
82,spaceship is now there.) 
83,JO: Doctor? 
84,"DOCTOR : Well, I think I know where we are. "
85,"(The Doctor comes out of the Tardis, writing in his notebook.) "
86,DOCTOR: And I've got a pretty good idea about when. 
87,JO: Come and take a look at this. 
88,DOCTOR: Look at what? 
89,JO: That. 
90,"DOCTOR: Well, it's just a space ship, Jo. You know, I reckon we must be"
91,"somewhere in the twenty sixth century. Well, interstellar travel's"
92,pretty routine by now. 
93,"JO: A moment ago, it seemed to change shape. "
94,DOCTOR: Mmm? 
95,JO: It was when I heard that noise. Didn't you hear it? 
96,"DOCTOR: Well, I did hear something, but very faintly. Come on, Jo."
97,Let's go and find the crew. I want to find the exact date for my
98,calculations. 
99,"JO: Doctor, it's coming straight at us! "
100,DOCTOR: What?
101,
102, [Spaceship Bridge]
103,
104, HARDY: You won't believe this. 
105,STEWART: Now what? 
106,HARDY: Maybe it's a wreck. 
107,STEWART: Try and make contact. They may need help. 
108,HARDY: This is earth cargo ship C982 in close proximity to you. Do you
109,read me? Do you read me? 
110,STEWART: Try again. 
111,HARDY: Do you read me? Are you in need of assistance? 
112,(Only static.) 
113,HARDY: It's a weird looking crate. 
114,"(The noise comes again, and the flash, and the spaceship changes"
115,shape.) 
116,HARDY: Draconians! 
117,STEWART: This close to Earth? 
118,HARDY: They're going to attack us! 
119,STEWART: Get the blasters. 
120,HARDY: You can't take on a battle cruiser. 
121,"STEWART: Get the blasters! Emergency, emergency, red alert. This is"
122,Earth cargo ship C982 on coordinate eight nine seven two stroke six
123,"four eight three. We are under attack by a Draconian battle cruiser,"
124,"galaxy class, equipped with neutronic missiles. Emergency, emergency! "
125,(Hardy runs to an open area in the spaceship and opens the weapons
126,locker.)
127,
128,[Spaceship cargo hold]
129,
130," DOCTOR: Well, that's interesting. They must be"
131,going to do a link up. 
132,JO: What for? 
133,"DOCTOR: Well, the two ships are joined together by a sort of tunnel,"
134,"you see, with two airlocks. Well, then they equalise the pressure"
135,allowing the crew to move from one ship to the other without using
136,"spacesuits. Well, otherwise they'd have to get all kitted up and do a"
137,space walk. 
138,"JO: Fascinating, but let's get back to the Tardis. "
139,"DOCTOR: Look, Jo, don't worry. We'll be on our way soon. Now let's go"
140,and take look at the ship's calendar. 
141,
142, [Spaceship]
143,
144, (Hardy takes two hand held blaster pistols from
145,the locker. The Doctor walks round the corner.) 
146,"DOCTOR: Ah, how do you do? I'm sorry about this intrusion. "
147,HARDY: Who are you? 
148,"(The weird noise comes, and to Hardy's eyes the Doctor changes into a"
149,scaly humanoid with a high conical head.) 
150,"DOCTOR: I said, how do you do? "
151,HARDY: Dragons! Drop that gun. 
152,DOCTOR: Gun? I haven't got a gun. This is simply my hand. 
153,(Jo enters.) 
154,JO: Doctor. No! 
155,"DOCTOR: Jo, what's the matter with you? "
156,JO: It's a Drashig! 
157,(Because that is what the noise makes her see.) 
158,"DOCTOR: Nonsense, it's simply a man with a gun. Now pull yourself"
159,together.
160,
161, [Spaceship Bridge]
162,
163, STEWART: This is Earth cargo ship C982. Situation
164,red alert. Draconian battle cruiser is now about to grapple. They are
165,"going to lock on now. Repeat, Draconian battle cruiser about to lock on"
166,now. All anti-boarding procedures carried out. Awaiting instructions.
167,Out. 
168,(The two ships dock. A Draconian with a forked beard appears on the
169,monitor.) 
170,PILOT : This is the commander of the Draconian battle
171,cruiser. We are locked onto your vessel and are about to board. If you
172,"offer any resistance, you will be destroyed. Open the hatch of your"
173,airlock. 
174,(The Doctor and Jo are brought in by Hardy.) 
175,HARDY: Move! 
176,HARDY: I found these two Dragons in the hold. 
177,STEWART: But that's impossible. They're only just locking on. 
178,"JO: Doctor, what's happening? What's going on? "
179,"DOCTOR: I'm not sure, Jo. Something rather intriguing. "
180,"PILOT : If you resist, we can destroy you with our"
181,neutronic weapons. 
182,"STEWART: If you destroy our ship, you won't get the cargo. "
183,"DOCTOR: Oh, so that's what it's all about. "
184,PILOT : Open the hatch to your airlock or we shall enter
185,your ship by force. 
186,STEWART: We refuse. 
187,HARDY: They can blow us to pieces! 
188,STEWART: I've sent a message to Earth asking for help. 
189,HARDY: Tell them about the prisoners. 
190,STEWART: We have captured two of your soldiers. They will not survive
191,if you enter our ship. Lock them in the hold. 
192,HARDY: Move! Get moving! 
193,"STEWART: Emergency, emergency. Red alert. This is cargo ship C982 on"
194,coordinate eight nine seven two stroke six four eight three. Draconian
195,battle cruiser has now locked on. They are about to force entry.
196,"Repeat, they are about to force entry. "
197, [President's office]
198,
199, (The message makes its way faster than light to
200,Earth. We are shown a pair of skyscrapers with a low long building in
201,front which has one dome and one upturned dish on it. The whole complex
202,is set in a lush green landscape. It is the Congresso Nacional do
203,"Brasil, in Brasilia. A Draconian in a green robe stands aloof while a"
204,woman in an orange dress talks to him.) 
205,"PRESIDENT: But all these charges are false, your Highness. We are not"
206,attacking Draconian ships. We never have. 
207,PRINCE: Our soldiers have seen the Earthmen attack us. Our cargoes have
208,been stolen. We are Draconians. We do not lie. 
209,"PRESIDENT: The honour of your race is well known, your Highness. That"
210,is why I cannot understand your actions. 
211,PRINCE: Actions? 
212,"PRESIDENT: You attack our ships, you steal their cargoes, you ignore"
213,our protests and just meet them with these counter charges. 
214,PRINCE: Our charges are true but yours are false. We do not attack your
215,ships. 
216,PRESIDENT: This is a transcript of a distress call from one of our
217,ships. From Earth's cargo ship number C982 on coordinate eight nine
218,"seven two, six four eight three. We are under attack by a Draconian"
219,"battle cruiser, galaxy class, equipped with neutronic missiles. "
220,PRINCE: The treaty between our two empires established a frontier in
221,space. We have never violated that frontier. You have invaded our part
222,of the galaxy many times. 
223,(A shadowy figure in the corner turns round.) 
224,WILLIAMS: In pursuit of your ships when they have raided ours! We've
225,been very patient. perhaps too patient. 
226,PRESIDENT: General Williams! I take it a rescue attempt has been
227,mounted? 
228,WILLIAMS: We've established an automatic procedure because of the
229,frequency of these attacks. 
230,PRESIDENT: Then I suggest you go and supervise the matter. 
231,WILLIAMS: There's no need. 
232,PRESIDENT: Please do as I say. 
233,"WILLIAMS: As you wish, Madam President. "
234,(Williams leaves.) 
235,PRINCE: Your General is insolent. We know the hatred he has always felt
236,for our people. Long ago he caused war. Now he wishes to do so again. 
237,"PRESIDENT: He's a soldier, your Highness, and he's angry. The people of"
238,Earth are angry. 
239,PRINCE: So are the nobles of my father's court! 
240,"PRESIDENT: I must ask you to take my personal appeal to your father,"
241,the Emperor. He must put a stop to these attacks. If Draconia has some
242,"grievances against Earth, then this is not the way to deal with them. "
243,PRINCE: Many of our noblemen felt it was a mistake to make a treaty
244,with the Earthmen. Perhaps they were right. You attack our ships and
245,"when we protest, you trick us with lies and evasions. I give you a"
246,final warning. The path you are treading leads only to war. And in that
247,"war, Draconia will destroy you!"
248,
249, [Spaceship room]
250,
251, HARDY: In there. 
252,DOCTOR: Look 
253,HARDY: In there. 
254,(Hardy bolts the Doctor and Jo into a small metal-lined room.) 
255,"JO: Doctor, what's happening on this ship? Are they both mad or am I?"
256,First I see a Drashig and 
257,(The Doctor takes out his sonic screwdriver.) 
258,"JO: No, you can put that away. Bolts. And why do they keep calling us"
259,Dragons? 
260,"DOCTOR: Well, that's the way they see us, I suppose. "
261,"JO: Yes, but why Dragons? "
262,DOCTOR: It's got to be some non-human life form. Something that they're
263,"frightened of. Dragons. Dragons. Yes, of course, Draconians. "
264,JO: What? 
265,"DOCTOR: Well, if this is the period that I think it is, there are two"
266,great empires spreading their way through the galaxy of the Milky Way. 
267,JO: Empires? You mean like Solos? 
268,DOCTOR: Those were the declining years of Earth's planetary empire.
269,This is just the beginning. Now Earth and Draconia are both been
270,"expanding, you see. Colonising one planet after another, and they're"
271,sitting on a powder keg. 
272,"JO: Yes, but why do they mistake us for these Dragons? "
273,"DOCTOR: No, Draconians. No, Dragons is rather an unflattering nickname."
274,"Well, you remember that sound you heard? "
275,JO: Yes. 
276,DOCTOR: And the man that you saw with the gun? 
277,"JO: Oh, no. No, no, what I saw was a Drashig! "
278,"DOCTOR: No, you didn't, Jo. That sound made you see what you fear most."
279,
280,JO: How? 
281,"DOCTOR: Well, it shouldn't be too difficult. Ultrasonics geared to"
282,"stimulate the fear centres of the brain, something like that. "
283,JO: How long does it last? How long before they see that we're just
284,people? 
285,"DOCTOR: Well, difficult to say. It seems to act like a sort of"
286,"post-hypnotic command. It'll fade eventually, of course. "
287,JO: Why should anybody go to all this trouble to make people see
288,things? 
289,DOCTOR: Why indeed. 
290,"JO: Well, we've got to get out of here somehow. "
291,(Jo looks through a grill section of the door.) 
292,JO: Doctor! I can see the Tardis! 
293,"DOCTOR: Well, that's one consolation, isn't it?"
294,
295, [Spaceship Bridge]
296,
297, STEWART: Try Earth Control again. 
298,"HARDY: Emergency, emergency, red alert. This is Earth cargo ship C982"
299,on coordinate eight nine seven two stroke six four eight three. 
300,(Interference comes back over the speaker.) 
301,"HARDY: Ah, they're jamming us. "
302,"STEWART: Well, maybe the first message got through. They'll send help. "
303,HARDY: Will they? They're probably still passing memos to each other. 
304,STEWART: They'll send help. 
305,HARDY: I know what they'll do. They'll send an urgent protest to the
306,"Draconian Embassy. By that time, we'll be finished. The government"
307,should have blown the buggers out of space years ago. 
308,STEWART: And have another war? 
309,HARDY: What do you think this is? 
310,"STEWART: Look, the door of our space lock is ninety nine percent"
311,durilium. They're not going to get through that in a hurry. 
312,"PILOT : Earth men, this is your last warning. Surrender"
313,your cargo and you will be unharmed. Resist and you will be destroyed. 
314,STEWART: Right. Looks like battle stations. We'd better get down to the
315,airlock. 
316,HARDY: You're not going to fight them? 
317,STEWART: If I have to. Do you have a better idea? 
318,HARDY: It's only a load of flour! 
319,"STEWART: It's my cargo. And if the Draconians want it, it's going to"
320,cost them more than just a few threats.
321,
322, [President's office]
323,
324, (The news is on the big wall-sized screen.) 
325,NEWSMAN [on screen] And the Bureau of Population Control announced
326,today that the recently reclaimed Arctic areas are now ready for
327,habitation. As a special inducement for those willing to live in New
328,"Glasgow and New Montreal, the first two totally enclosed cities to be"
329,"opened, the family allowance will be increased to two children per"
330,couple. News is just coming through of another Draconian attack on an
331,Earth cargo ship in space. This is the third attack on an Earth cargo
332,ship this month. In a statement issued by the Draconian Embassy on
333,"Earth, the Draconian government denies all knowledge of this or any"
334,other attacks. 
335,(Williams enters.) 
336,"NEWSMAN [on screen]: As yet there has been no official comment, but"
337,"Congressman Brook, Leader of the Opposition has said, the people of"
338,Earth will no longer tolerate these unprovoked attacks. It is time for
339,the World Government to take a stand and issue a final ultimatum to the
340,Draconian Emperor. 
341,(The President turns off the screen.) 
342,PRESIDENT: I thought I ordered a complete security blackout. 
343,WILLIAMS: The news services have their own monitors. They probably
344,picked up the distress messages. 
345,PRESIDENT: And? 
346,WILLIAMS: The rescue ships should rendezvous in seventeen and a half
347,"minutes from now. It'll be too late, of course. All they'll find will"
348,be dead men and a gutted ship.
349,
350, [Spaceship]
351,
352, (Someone is using a thermal lance to cut through
353,"the airlock. Someone large, brown, ape-like and not at all Draconian.) "
354,HARDY: They'll be through that door any minute!
355,
356, [Spaceship room]
357,
358,DOCTOR: There we go. 
359,"JO: Doctor, what are you doing? "
360,DOCTOR: I'm reversing the polarity of my ultrasonic screwdriver's power
361,"source, thereby converting it into an extremely powerful electromagnet."
362,
363,JO: Oh. What good will that do? 
364,"DOCTOR: You wait and see, Jo. "
365,(The Doctor points the screwdriver out of the door grill. There is a
366,scraping sound.) 
367,JO: Is it working? 
368,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think so."
369,
370, [Spaceship]
371,
372, HARDY: I'm going to get the prisoners. 
373,STEWART: What for? 
374,"HARDY: We're using them as hostages, remember? "
375,STEWART: You'd better be quick about it. We haven't got much time.
376,
377, [Spaceship room]
378,
379, JO: How's it going? 
380,DOCTOR: Nearly there. There you are - that's it. 
381,(The Doctor opens the door just as Hardy arrives.) 
382,"DOCTOR: Oh, how very embarrassing. Good afternoon. "
383,(Hardy stops the Doctor shutting the door again.) 
384,HARDY: Out. 
385,JO: That's just where we were going. 
386,HARDY: We're going to meet your friends.
387,
388, [Spaceship]
389,
390, HARDY: Come on! Get up there! 
391,"STEWART: Come on, they're almost through. "
392,"HARDY: Get in front! If your friends start shooting, they'll get you"
393,first. 
394,JO: But they're not our friends! 
395,STEWART: You are part of their boarding party. 
396,"DOCTOR: Well, they haven't boarded yet. They're still breaking through"
397,"that door. Now, try and be logical, man. "
398,HARDY: They're coming through! 
399,JO: Ogrons! 
400,(The Doctor grabs Stewart's arm and throws him against the newcomers.) 
401,"DOCTOR: Back to the Tardis, Jo. Back! "
402,(An Ogron shoots Hardy.)
403,
404, [Spaceship cargo hold]
405,
406, (A second shot gets the Doctor in the back. He
407,falls.) 
408,JO: Doctor! Doctor!
409,
410, [President's office]
411,
412, (The rolling news coverage now shows an image of
413,C982.) 
414,NEWSMAN : Distress signals have been received from another Earth
415,"cargo ship, reporting an attack by a Draconian battle cruiser. Rescue"
416,ships are now on their way. 
417,(Williams turns it off.) 
418,"WILLIAMS: There have been anti-Draconian riots in Tokyo and Belgrade,"
419,and the Draconian Consulate in Helsinki has been burnt to the ground.
420,"In Los Angeles, demonstrators burnt an effigy of you. "
421,(The intercom beeps.) 
422,PRESIDENT: Yes? 
423,"SECRETARY : They have just found the cargo ship, Madam"
424,"President, but it is not responding to signals. "
425,WILLIAMS: And the Draconians? 
426,"SECRETARY : There is no sign of any Draconian ships, sir."
427,They are about to board now. 
428,PRESIDENT: Thank you. We shall soon know what really happened.
429,WILLIAMS: If there's anyone alive to tell them.
430,
431, [Spaceship cargo hold]
432,
433, JO : Doctor? 
434,DOCTOR: Jo? 
435,JO : Doctor! 
436,DOCTOR: Jo? 
437,"JO : Doctor, I'm over here! "
438,(The Doctor gets up carefully and goes over to the room.) 
439,"DOCTOR: All right, Jo, what are you doing in there? "
440,"JO: Oh, Doctor, thank goodness you're all right! I thought they'd"
441,killed you.
442,
443, [Spaceship room]
444,
445,(The Doctor unbolts the door and enters.) 
446,"JO: Come on, come and sit down. "
447,DOCTOR: Must have been some kind of neuronic stun gun. I wonder why
448,"they didn't kill me? What exactly happened, Jo? "
449,"JO: Well, they took the cargo, threw me in here and, Doctor? "
450,DOCTOR: Mmm? 
451,JO: They also took the Tardis. 
452,DOCTOR: Oh. 
453,JO: We're stranded. What are we going to do? 
454,"DOCTOR: Well, try and get the Tardis back, of course. Why should the"
455,Ogrons attack this ship? 
456,JO: To steal the cargo. 
457,"DOCTOR: No. No, there's more to it than that. That sound that you"
458,"heard, it's all too sophisticated for the Ogrons. "
459,"JO: Well, they're gone now. "
460,"DOCTOR: Yeah, the question is, where? "
461,"JO: Hey, Doctor, last time we met the Ogrons they were working for the"
462,"Daleks, right? Well, you don't suppose that that "
463,"DOCTOR: No, not necessarily. No, the Ogrons are mercenaries. Other life"
464,"forms use them to do their dirty work. Come on, Jo, let's go and find"
465,the crew.
466,
467, [Spaceship]
468,
469, (Hardy and Stewart are on the floor. The airlock
470,door appears to have been repaired.) 
471,"DOCTOR: Jo, take a look at that one. Well, they're both stunned, just"
472,as I was. That's funny. The Ogrons have repaired the airlock door. 
473,"JO: Well, that was nice of them. "
474,"DOCTOR: Well, if they hadn't, we'd have both been done for. All the air"
475,would have escaped when the ships unlocked. 
476,JO: Why should they go to all that trouble? 
477,"DOCTOR: Well, maybe they've got kind hearts. There's good in everyone"
478,"you know, Jo. "
479,GARDINER : Earth Battle Cruiser to Earth cargo ship number C982. We

492,C982. We are now approaching you. Do you read me? Do you read me?
493,"Prepare to be boarded. Repeat, prepare to be boarded. Do you read me?"
494,Over. 
495,"DOCTOR: Hello battle cruiser, battle cruiser. This is the cargo ship."
496,Over. 
497,GARDINER : What is your situation? 
498,DOCTOR: The ship has been attacked and the cargo stolen. Over. 
499,GARDINER : Do you have casualties? 
500,"DOCTOR: Yes, the crew are stunned, but otherwise they're unharmed."
501,Over. 
502,GARDINER : We shall lock on five seconds from now.

507,"to the clank of the docking, and the Doctor enters.) "
508,"DOCTOR: It's all right, Jo. We're being rescued. "
509,STEWART: What happened? 
510,"DOCTOR: Don't worry, old chap. You'll be all right now. I think "
511,STEWART: Draconians! They're boarding! 
512,(Gardiner enters with a troop of men.) 
513,GARDINER: Stewart? Who are you? 
514,DOCTOR: Passengers. 
515,GARDINER: I see. Having a fancy dress party? What happened? 
516,STEWART: Dragons attacked us. 
517,GARDINER: Did they get the cargo? 
518,STEWART: I don't know. 
519,"JO: Yes, they took everything. "
520,DOCTOR: Including some rather valuable property of mine. 
521,"GARDINER: Well, tough luck. "
522,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you very much. "
523,HARDY: Dragons. They attacked us. 
524,"GARDINER: Yes, we know. You say you're passengers. Isn't that a little"
525,unusual on a cargo ship? 
526,"DOCTOR: Well, we're here, aren't we? "
527,GARDINER: Where did you pick these two up? 
528,STEWART: I don't know. I can't seem to remember. 
529,GARDINER: Pull yourself together! How did they get on board? 
530,STEWART: Stowaways. That's it. They were stowaways. They were sending
531,messages. 
532,HARDY: That's right. They were helping the Dragons! They're traitors!

538,want to be on this ship. It was an accident! 
539,GARDINER: You said you were passengers. 
540,"DOCTOR: I was merely trying to avoid a lot of tiresome explanations,"
541,old chap. 
542,"GARDINER: Stewart, I'll leave Kemp on board to take your ship back to"
543,Earth. 
544,STEWART: What about these two? 
545,GARDINER: Lock them in the hold. Put a guard on them. 
546,JO: But we haven't done anything! 
547,GARDINER: They say you have! Take them away. 
548,"DOCTOR: Now, if you'll only listen to me "
549,GARDINER: You can talk to Earth Security. They'll listen. It's their
550,business. Put them in the starboard cubicle. 
551,"KEMP: All right, get moving."

563,(Jo looks out of the room to see they do have an alert guard.) 
564,JO: Still watching the door. 
565,"DOCTOR: That's what he's there for, isn't it. "
566,"JO: Right. We'll give it a few minutes, then I'll start groaning and"
567,"pretending I'm ill. When he comes in, you can use your Venusian karate."
568,
569,DOCTOR: And then what? 
570,"JO: Then, we'll take his gun, go to the flight deck and make somebody"
571,take us back to Earth. 
572,"DOCTOR: Jo, this ship's already going back to Earth. "
573,"JO: Oh. Oh, dear. Hmm. Hey, I've got a terrific idea. I saw this film"
574,"once, you see, and there were these two big gangsters, big fellows they"
575,"were, with sort of cauliflower ears "
576,"DOCTOR: Look, Jo "
577,JO: And one of them 
578,DOCTOR: Will you stop pacing up and down like a perishing panda. Now
579,"come and sit down. Let me think, will you? That's better. "
580,"JO: Doctor? Well, now the Ogrons have gone, why don't the crewmen"
581,remember what really happened? 
582,"DOCTOR: Because the true facts have been erased from their minds,"
583,that's why. 
584,"JO: Well, yes, but why do they keep telling lies about us? "
585,"DOCTOR: They don't know that they're lying, Jo. They're desperately"
586,trying to fit us into their version of things. 
587,"JO: Well, what are we going to do, then? "
588,"DOCTOR: Well, when we get back to Earth, we've got to reach someone in"
589,authority whose mind isn't already closed. 
590,JO: Closed to what? 
591,"DOCTOR: Jo, look, these people believe that the Draconians are"
592,"attacking their spaceships, right? "
593,JO: Right. 
594,"DOCTOR: And we know that they're wrong, don't we? "
595,"JO: Well, yes, it was Ogrons. "
596,"DOCTOR: Well, we also know that the Ogrons couldn't possibly have"
597,created that hallucinatory device that makes the Earthmen think they're
598,Draconians. 
599,"JO: Oh. Oh, well that's simple then. I mean, all we've got to do is"
600,"find out what's going on, who's behind the Ogrons, where they've taken"
601,"the Tardis, go and get it back and then we can all go home. Right? "
602,DOCTOR: Right. 
603,JO: Oh. I don't know what I've been worrying about

605,
606, (Kemp is reporting in on the President's intercom
607,monitor screen.) 
608,KEMP : We are now in space port ten. The ship will land in
609,"fifteen minutes. The crew are safe. Also aboard, two human stowaways,"
610,origins unknown. 
611,WILLIAMS: I want a cordon around the landing area the minute that ship
612,"touches down. Nobody on, nobody off till I get there. "
613,KEMP : Sir. 
614,WILLIAMS: I'd better get down there. I want to handle the preliminary
615,interrogations myself. 
616,"PRESIDENT: Good. General Williams? Whatever you find out, you'll report"
617,directly to me. 
618,WILLIAMS: Naturally. And now if you'll excuse me? 
619, [Spaceship room]
620,
621, JO: What do they think they're doing? We've been
622,landed for simply ages. 
623,"DOCTOR: Well, twelve minutes to be exact, Jo. "
624,JO: Shush. Someone's coming. 
625,(Kemp enters.)

633,
634, [President's office]
635,
636, PRESIDENT: Draconian agents? Are you sure? 
637,WILLIAMS: What else can they be? Their story is obvious nonsense. 
638,PRESIDENT: But why? Why would the Draconians leave them on board the
639,ship? 
640,WILLIAMS: The Draconians are preparing for war. 
641,PRESIDENT: You're still only suspecting them. There is no proof. 
642,"WILLIAMS: Then they need to plant human agents, traitors, on this"
643,planet to sabotage our war effort. 
644,PRESIDENT: But we are bound to suspect them. They must have realised? 
645,WILLIAMS: The Draconians probably thought the crew was dead. We could
646,easily have accepted those two as passengers. Two unfortunate refugees
647,"from a Draconian attack, ideally placed for espionage. "
648,"PRESIDENT: If you are right, the sooner we confront the Draconians with"
649,"this, the better. Bring the prisoners in. We'll bring them face to face"
650,with the Draconian ambassador.

661,JO: Quite some while ago. 
662,"GARDINER: Well, I'll see they send you some food. "
663,DOCTOR: I'd like to get a message through to your President. 
664,GARDINER: Not a chance. I'm going straight back to my ship. Don't want
665,"to get mixed up with security. It's not healthy. Look, I'll give you a"
666,piece of advice. 
667,DOCTOR: Yes? 
668,"GARDINER: Sooner or later, you're going to tell them everything."
669,They'll use the mind probe. You talk to them now. You'll save
670,yourselves a lot of trouble. 
671,(Gardiner leaves. The metal door slides shut.) 
672,JO: A mind probe? 
673,"DOCTOR: Oh, you don't want to worry about those things, Jo. As long as"
674,"you tell them the truth, they can't do you any harm. "
675,JO: They can't? 
676,"DOCTOR: No, of course not. Well, they're only sort of computers with a"
677,"few extra knobs on. And you know how stupid computers can be, don't"
678,"you? Now come and sit down, stop worrying. Come on. Sit down. Did I"
679,ever tell you the story about how I was once captured by the Medusoids?
680,
681,JO: What are they? 
682,"DOCTOR: Medusoids? How can I describe them to you? Well, they're a sort"
683,"of hairy jellyfish with claws, teeth and a leg. "
684,JO: Erk! 
685,"DOCTOR: Anyway, they put me under one of these mind probes things, you"
686,"see, and tried to get me to tell them where I was going. So, I said I"
687,"was on my way to meet a giant rabbit, a pink elephant and a purple"
688,horse with yellow spots. 
689,JO: What happened? 
690,"DOCTOR: Well, the poor old machine just couldn't believe it, had a"
691,nervous breakdown. 
692,JO: And then what happened? 
693,"DOCTOR: Well, they put me under another one of these mind probe things"
694,and the same thing happened. 
695,"JO: But you weren't telling the truth. I mean, you weren't really going"
696,"to meet a giant rabbit, a pink elephant and a, what was it? "
697,"DOCTOR: A purple horse with yellow spots. Yes, I was. You see, they"
698,were all delegates for the third Intergalactic Peace Conference. 
699,JO: How did you get away from these things? 
700,DOCTOR: Well they had to turn me loose eventually. 
701,JO: Why? 
702,DOCTOR: They ran out of mind probes.
703,
704, [President's office]
705,
706, PRESIDENT: And you are quite sure it was a
707,Draconian battle cruiser. 
708,"STEWART: Of course, Madam. "
709,HARDY: They locked on and boarded us. We saw them. They were
710,Draconians. 
711,PRESIDENT: Thank you. That will be all. I hope you will soon recover
712,from your ordeal. 
713,(Hardy and Stewart leave. The Draconian Prince and an aide have been
714,listening.) 
715,"PRESIDENT: Well, your Highness? "
716,PRINCE: These men are your servants. They are saying what they have
717,been ordered to say. 
718,"WILLIAMS: On this occasion, we have more than our servants to confront"
719,you with. We have captured two of your human agents. 
720,PRINCE: We have no human agents. Subversion and espionage are expressly
721,forbidden by the treaty of peace between our two empires. 
722,WILLIAMS: A treaty which you have flagrantly broken. 
723,PRINCE: I shall return to my embassy. 
724,"PRESIDENT: Just a moment please, your Highness. Bring them in. "
725,(The Doctor and Jo are brought in at gunpoint.) 
726,WILLIAMS: These people stowed away on the cargo ship. They transmitted
727,signals which enabled your battlecruiser to home in on its prey. 
728,PRINCE: I know nothing of this. 
729,"PRESIDENT: Perhaps you do not, but some servant of the Draconian empire"
730,employed them. 
731,"DOCTOR: Madam, I can assure that I've never been employed by anybody."
732,Least of all by the Draconians. 
733,PRINCE: Your servants should have been better rehearsed in their lies. 
734,WILLIAMS: Or they're showing a misguided loyalty to their Draconian
735,masters. 
736,"DOCTOR: If we really were working for the Draconians, why did they"
737,leave us in your ship? 
738,WILLIAMS: To act as spies when you were brought back to Earth. 
739,"DOCTOR: Allow me to congratulate you, sir. You have the most totally"
740,"closed mind that I've ever encountered. Madam, I beg of you to listen"
741,to me. Some third party is trying to provoke war between Earth and
742,Draconia. You are both being duped. 
743,WILLIAMS: Take them away. 
744,"PRESIDENT: Just a minute, please. Why should a third party wish to do"
745,this? 
746,"DOCTOR: I've no idea, Madam, but believe me, that is what is happening."
747,
748,WILLIAMS: Take them away! 
749,DOCTOR: Now please listen to me! If you don't you'll be involved in a
750,war that could cause the death of millions! 
751,(The Doctor and Jo are hustles out.) 
752,PRINCE: Is this the evidence upon which you accuse me? 
753,PRESIDENT: I must ask you to convey a formal protest to your Emperor. 
754,PRINCE: I shall inform him of this latest insult to the honour of the
755,Draconian empire. 
756,(The Prince and his aide leave.) 
757,WILLIAMS: We should have used the mind probe before we saw the
758,Ambassador. If we'd had a full confession. 
759,PRESIDENT: Has it occurred to you that they might have been speaking
760,the truth? 
761,WILLIAMS: Is it likely? Mysterious alien giants that can change their
762,form? A pocket spaceship that appear inside another? 
763,PRESIDENT: I suppose you're right. It is nonsensical. 
764,"WILLIAMS: Just you leave them to me. I'll get the truth out of them,"
765,eventually.

773,"DOCTOR: I've got to get them to listen to me, for their sakes as well"
774,as ours. 
775,"JO: Well, why their sakes? "
776,"DOCTOR: Well, that was a Draconian with the President, you know."
777,Obviously an Ambassador of some kind. 
778,JO: So? 
779,"DOCTOR: Well, clearly Earth and Draconia are on the brink of war, and"
780,they both believe it's the others fault. 
781,"JO: Well, never mind about that. What about getting us out of here? "
782,"DOCTOR: Well, I can but try. Yeah, seems a fairly conventional type of"
783,electronic lock. Rather old-fashioned really. Here goes. 
784,"(The Doctor turns on his sonic screwdriver, and an alarm sounds.) "

789, PRINCE: But why? Why should they produce such an
790,elaborate lie? 
791,AIDE: The ways of the Earthmen are devious. They're an inscrutable
792,species. 
793,PRINCE: Obviously they are preparing the next stage of their plan.
794,"First, the attacks on our ships and now this. "
795,"AIDE: Is it possible, your Highness, that for once the Earthmen spoke"
796,the truth? Some plan of the Emperor of which your Highness has not been
797,informed? 
798,PRINCE: The Emperor would not possibly contemplate such a plan. We do
799,not break the treaty of peace. 
800,AIDE: Shall I prepare your Excellency's report to the Emperor on this
801,meeting? 
802,PRINCE: I must have more information. 
803,AIDE: It would be useful to question the humans who were found on the
804,ship. 
805,PRINCE: They are supposed to be prisoners. 
806,"AIDE: Prisoners have been known to escape, your Highness. "
807,PRINCE: Not without help. And that would be a grave act of hostility. I
808,could not possibly countenance such a plan. 
809,"AIDE: But should two escaping prisoners seek sanctuary in this Embassy,"
810,it would be uncivilised to turn them away. 
811,PRINCE: I must not detain you longer. No doubt you have duties

828,AIDE : His Highness would like to question them. In your
829,"presence, of course, Madam President. "
830,PRESIDENT: For what purpose? 
831,AIDE : His Highness feels that such an interrogation would
832,help to convince you that they are not agents of Draconia.

865,PRESIDENT: Break off diplomatic relations completely? 
866,WILLIAMS: What diplomatic relations? The embassy staff have behaved
867,like criminals. 
868,PRESIDENT: We don't know that the Ambassador was behind this! 
869,WILLIAMS: The attackers were Draconians. They were clearly seen. The
870,"Draconian embassy tricked you into moving the prisoners, then mounted"
871,an armed attack in order to rescue their agents. 
872,PRESIDENT: Is the girl here?

886,"JO: But he didn't escape, he was kidnapped. "
887,WILLIAMS: He was rescued by your Draconian paymasters. 
888,PRESIDENT: The wisest course you can take now is to make a full
889,confession. Remember your colleague has left you to your fate. 
890,"JO: Oh, but you've got it all wrong. You see, the Doctor was pleased"
891,"when you sent for him because he wanted to talk to you, and "
892,WILLIAMS: We have eye witness reports on what occurred. 
893,PRESIDENT: We need to know how you came to work for the Draconians. 
894,WILLIAMS: When were you recruited? How many agents do they have on
895,Earth? What are their plans? 
896,"PRESIDENT: If you tell us everything, I'll promise you I'll see to it"
897,personally that you will be treated leniently. JO: But I don't know
898,"what you're talking about. Look, we told you the truth when we first"
899,came here. We're not working for the Draconians.

901,interrogation techniques without delay.

910,DOCTOR: Don't you realise what you've done? You've now finally
911,convinced them that we're both Draconian agents. 
912,PRINCE: There is no need to maintain this pretence. We know that you
913,are both agents of the Earth government. 
914,AIDE: You're part of a plot against the Draconian empire.

917,PRINCE: You are working for General Williams. 
918,DOCTOR: I'm what? 
919,"PRINCE: General Williams hates out people. Once before, he caused war"
920,between us and the Earthmen. Now he plans to do so again. 
921,AIDE: Such a war would be madness since both empires would be
922,destroyed. 
923,"DOCTOR: Yes, I couldn't agree with you more. That's exactly what I've"
924,been trying to say to you. The Earth cargo ship was not attacked by

928,PRINCE: Ogrons? 
929,DOCTOR: Yes. Some third party's employing them trying to make trouble
930,between Earth and Draconia. 
931,"PRINCE: If you tell us the details of General Williams' plan, we shall"
932,be able to expose him to your President. There will still be a chance
933,for peace. 
934,"DOCTOR: My dear chap, nobody is more devoted to the cause of peace than"
935,I am. But I cannot tell you something that I don't know. 
936,AIDE: We have mind probing techniques just as efficient as those
937,"employed by you Earthmen. If you do not speak now, we shall force you"
938,to confess! 
939,DOCTOR: Don't you realise you're completely on the wrong tack? There is
940,"a plot, yes, but the Earthmen are not behind it any more than you are. "
941,AIDE: Take him away! 
942,(Two Draconian guards approach from either side. The Doctor grabs them
943,and pushes them forward into the Aide and onto the Prince's desk. In
944,his rush to escape he falls over the chair he was sitting in and a
945,guard aims his weapon.)

961,"JO: Doctor, where've you been? "
962,DOCTOR: I've been paying a brief but unwilling visit to the Draconian
963,embassy. And I'm afraid I had to leave in rather a hurry and found
964,myself back here. 
965,JO: What happened? 
966,"DOCTOR: Well, believe it or believe it not, Jo, they think we're"
967,working for General Williams and trying to provoke a war. 
968,JO: Oh no! 
969,"DOCTOR: Yes, Earth is blaming Draconia and Draconia is blaming Earth. "
970,JO: And both sides are blaming us. 
971,DOCTOR: That's about it. What's the matter? 
972,(A noise has started up somewhere.) 
973,"JO: Well, that sound. The one I heard on the cargo ship. I think I can"
974,hear it again. 
975,(So can all the people in and around the security building. A guard
976,"briefly sees an Ogron, but it turns into a Draconian and he gets shot."

987,office. She has changed into a blue dress and is having her temples
988,"massaged - to cure her headache, presumably - while her secretary goes"
989,through her messages.) 
990,PRESIDENT: What's next? 
991,SECRETARY: The Historical Monuments Preservation Society wants you to
992,address their annual meeting on the tenth of January. 
993,"PRESIDENT: Hmm. Clashes with a cabinet meeting. Er, express apologies."
994,Congratulate them on their good work. 
995,SECRETARY: And there's an enquiry report in on the anti-Draconian riots
996,in Peking last week. The petitioners seek your support for
997,compensation. 
998,PRESIDENT: Pass that on to the Treasury with my recommendation. All
999,claims to be sympathetically considered. Anything else? 
1000,SECRETARY: General Williams requires an interview. He says it's
1001,extremely urgent.

1017,several other cities de ) 
1018,"SECRETARY : General Williams to see you, Madam. "
1019,"PRESIDENT: Will you ask him to come in, please? "
1020,(She switches the television off as Williams enters.) 
1021,WILLIAMS: Vanished. The Draconian kidnappers have completely
1022,disappeared. No trace of them at all. 
1023,PRESIDENT: Have some wine? 
1024,"WILLIAMS: Thank you. Well, at least they didn't get away with it. Those"
1025,two traitors are back in their cell and that's where they'll stay. The
1026,time has come for extreme measures. 
1027,PRESIDENT: I know. You want me to break off diplomatic relations. 
1028,WILLIAMS: I want more than that. This is a military situation. We
1029,should attack now. 
1030,PRESIDENT: No! I will not be responsible for starting a war! 
1031,"WILLIAMS: There is one thing worse than war, Madam President, and that"
1032,is defeat. You must think of your own position. 
1033,PRESIDENT: What about my position? 
1034,"WILLIAMS: If you're not seen to act decisively against the Draconians,"
1035,"you can, and will, be replaced. "
1036,"PRESIDENT: By you, perhaps? "
1037,WILLIAMS: We used to be friends once. I know what's happened has
1038,"changed all that, but do you really think I'd betray you? "
1039,"PRESIDENT: No. No, I've never doubted you. I'm sorry. "
1040,WILLIAMS: There are certain senior officers who feel that a military
1041,dictatorship is needed. Your political opponents are clamouring for
1042,war. You must act now or they will bring you down. 
1043,PRESIDENT: I shall break off diplomatic relations. The Draconian
1044,Ambassador and his staff will be expelled from this planet. I shall
1045,inform the Emperor that his actions will no longer be tolerated. But
1046,"unless you give me conclusive evidence about their intentions, I shall"
1047,not strike the first blow. 
1048,WILLIAMS: The proof you need is in the minds of those two traitors. We
1049,shall have to use the mind probe. 
1050,PRESIDENT: Not on the girl. Perhaps I can make her see reason. 
1051,WILLIAMS: I doubt that. I prefer to put my faith in the mind probe.

1056,device on his forehead. Jo is not there. A woman in purple dress and
1057,over the elbow gloves is operating a console.) 
1058,"WILLIAMS: Well, Doctor, shall we try again? "
1059,"DOCTOR: You can suit yourself. But I warn you, you're wasting your"
1060,time. 
1061,WILLIAMS: Are you a member of the Draconian secret service? 
1062,DOCTOR: No. 
1063,"TECHNICIAN: No change in the rhythm, sir. He must be telling the truth."
1064,
1065,WILLIAMS: How did you get on the cargo ship? 
1066,"DOCTOR: I came here in my own ship, the Tardis. "
1067,WILLIAMS: Tardis? 
1068,"DOCTOR: Yes, my own spaceship. "
1069,(The monitor shows the Tardis whirling through space.) 
1070,WILLIAMS: Why did you help the Draconians attack the cargo ship? 
1071,"DOCTOR: I didn't. In any case, it wasn't the Draconians, it was the"
1072,Ogrons. 
1073,(The screen shows the fight with the Ogrons.) 
1074,"WILLIAMS: Your machine can't be working properly, or else he's"
1075,controlling it. 
1076,"TECHNICIAN: I've checked all the circuits, sir. Those are his thoughts."
1077,
1078,WILLIAMS: We know that this man is a Draconian agent. He must be lying.
1079,
1080,"TECHNICIAN: Perhaps he's already been brainwashed, sir. But as far as"
1081,"he's concerned, what he's telling us is the truth. "
1082,WILLIAMS: Then we must break through his conditioning. Unless you tell
1083,"me the truth, the real truth, I shall be forced to use increased power."
1084,
1085,"DOCTOR: I wouldn't do that, old man. I know these machines. They aren't"
1086,"awfully reliable, you know. "
1087,WILLIAMS: You'd do better to worry about the effect on your mind. 
1088,"DOCTOR: There's just no telling some people, is there, my dear. "
1089,WILLIAMS: Step up the power. Increase to twelve. Now! Are you an agent
1090,of the Draconians? 
1091,DOCTOR: No. 
1092,WILLIAMS: When do they plan to attack us? 
1093,DOCTOR: They don't. 
1094,WILLIAMS: How did you board the cargo ship? 
1095,DOCTOR: In the Tardis. 
1096,WILLIAMS: Who first recruited you to serve the Draconians? 
1097,DOCTOR: No one. 
1098,WILLIAMS: Who are the other Draconian agents on Earth? 
1099,DOCTOR: I don't know. 
1100,"WILLIAMS: The truth, man. I want the truth! "
1101,DOCTOR: I'm telling you the truth. 
1102,WILLIAMS: I will get the truth! 
1103,"(And the mind probe machine explodes. Later, the Doctor is still on the"
1104,"bench but the mind probe equipment is gone and Jo is back, now wearing"
1105,a black judo suit.) 
1106,JO: Doctor? Are you sure you're all right? 
1107,DOCTOR: Mmm hmm. Apart from a bit of a headache. I like the new outfit.
1108,"Who are you fighting tonight? What happened to you, anyway? "
1109,"JO: Oh, they kept going on at me to confess. "
1110,"DOCTOR: Yes, awkward, isn't it? Well, they've made up their minds, you"
1111,see. They'll only believe us if we tell them what they want to hear.
1112,It's a pity really that the Ogrons didn't succeed in kidnapping us.
1113,Perhaps we should have been more helpful. 
1114,JO: Why? 
1115,"DOCTOR: Well, if they had succeeded, presumably they'd have taken us to"
1116,"where the Tardis is. I'm sorry, Jo. I'm afraid another kidnapping"
1117,attempt is our only ray of hope. 
1118,"JO: So, we just sit around here waiting for those jolly old Ogrons to"
1119,turn up again. 
1120,"DOCTOR: That's about it, yes. "
1121,(A guard enters.) 
1122,GUARD: The President wants to see you. Get moving. Not you. (Jo) You. 
1123,JO: This may be your chance. Good luck.

1129, PRESIDENT: I'm giving you a final chance to tell
1130,me the truth. 
1131,DOCTOR: Madam President. I've been telling you the truth for some
1132,"considerable time, but you just won't believe me. "
1133,"PRESIDENT: I can't think why you chose to work for the Draconians, but"
1134,"whatever it is, I'll double any offer that they have made to you. "
1135,"DOCTOR: Well, that's very generous of you, Madam, but you'd only be"
1136,buying information that doesn't exist. 
1137,PRESIDENT: You leave me no alternative. Under the powers invested in me
1138,"by the Special Security Act, I'm sending you to the Lunar Penal Colony."
1139,
1140,"DOCTOR: What, without a trial? Without even a chance to state my case?"
1141,"So, you're just tucking me quietly away, are you? What about my"
1142,companion? 
1143,PRESIDENT: She will remain here. I have hopes that away from your
1144,"influence, I might be able to make her see the error of her ways. "
1145,DOCTOR: But you will see that she comes to no harm? 
1146,"PRESIDENT: We are not barbarians. If you want to help her, why don't"
1147,you tell me where she comes from? I'd like to inform her family. 
1148,"DOCTOR: I'd like to, Madam. I really would, but there's nothing that I"
1149,can say that you'd believe. May I say goodbye to her? 
1150,WILLIAMS: No! You'll be leaving immediately for the penal colony. We're
1151,putting you where your Draconian friends will be unable to reach you.

1164,"DOCTOR: Not particularly, no. "

1166,your common criminals. 
1167,DOCTOR: Have you got many political prisoners here?

1183,CROSS: No chocolate allowed here.

1193,"here. You do as you're told. If you behave yourselves, you'll be"
1194,"reasonably treated, but you have no rights and there is no means of"

1204,(The Governor leaves.) 
1205,CROSS: Sir. That's probably the last time you'll see the Governor. But
1206,you'll see me every day. Now I run a nice quiet tidy section here. Any
1207,"trouble, it's a black mark on my records, so there's, er, never any"

1215,DALE: Cross is a trusty. They are all hardcore criminals specially
1216,imported from other prisons. 
1217,PATEL: Professor Dale? 
1218,"DALE: You were on our youth committee, were you not? "
1219,"PATEL: That's right, sir. We met last year, just before your arrest. "
1220,"DALE: Well, you'll find yourself in very good company here, my boy. I"
1221,sometimes think there are more members of the Peace Party up here than
1222,back on Earth.

1224,DALE: Escape? Occasionally. Why do you ask? 
1225,DOCTOR: It seems a perfectly natural question. 
1226,DALE: Do you know this man?

1249,PRESIDENT: Nevertheless the dominion government of Sirius 4 does have a
1250,claim to them. 
1251,WILLIAMS: And so do we. They have vital information. 
1252,PRESIDENT: They must be very important to them. I think I'd better see

1254,WILLIAMS: Surely you're not going to hand them over? 
1255,"PRESIDENT: Well, we'll have to see, won't we. Relationships with the"
1256,"colony of planets are always difficult. And if there is a war, we'll"

1271,DALE: That's not one of the things we discuss.

1274,"PATEL: Yes, what did happen? "

1286,good enough.

1289,WILLIAMS: Part of Earth's empire. 
1290,"MASTER: Yes, but it has been granted dominion status. "
1291,"PRESIDENT: He has a point, General Williams. Once a colony has been"
1292,"raised to dominion status it enjoys certain autonomous rights,"
1293,including the right to try and punish its own citizens. 
1294,MASTER: Exactly. But I feel assured that once these two have come to

1296,"for further interrogation. But meanwhile, my orders are clear. I must"
1297,take them back with me to Sirius 4. 
1298,WILLIAMS: I will not hand over vital prisoners to some tin-pot colony!

1350,MASTER: To coin a phrase. I've come to take you away from all this. 
1351,JO: What are you talking about? 
1352,"MASTER: Well, surely you don't want to spend the rest of your life in"
1353,"here, do you? "
1354,"JO: Well, I'm not going anywhere with you, that's for sure. "
1355,"MASTER: Oh, but you are, you know. Believe it or not, I am a fully"
1356,"accredited Commissioner from the planet Sirius 4, and you and the"
1357,Doctor are two dangerous criminals being handed over into my custody. 
1358,JO: So it was you! You ordered those Ogrons to attack the ships and
1359,pretend they were Draconians! 
1360,MASTER: But of course. Those lumbering idiots could never have thought
1361,up such a brilliant scheme by themselves. 
1362,JO: Why did you want to start a war? 
1363,"MASTER: Now, come on, Miss Grant, be reasonable. You want to see the"
1364,"Doctor again, don't you? "
1365,JO: Where is he? 
1366,"MASTER: He's in another prison, on the moon. We're going to collect"
1367,him. 
1368,JO: How do I know you're telling the truth? 
1369,MASTER: You don't. And the only way you'll find out is by coming with
1370,me. Well? 
1371,JO: How did you know we were here in the first place? 
1372,"MASTER: Well, after they'd attacked the cargo ships, the Ogrons"
1373,"returned to their planet, taking their loot with them. Now imagine my"
1374,"surprise, and my delight, when I found that they'd brought me the"
1375,Doctor's Tardis. 
1376,JO: And why are you taking us with you? 
1377,"MASTER: Oh, need you ask? How could I leave two dear friends in such"
1378,dire straights? 
1379,"JO: Oh, you don't seriously think that I'm going to believe that you"
1380,want to help us 
1381,"MASTER: Believe what you like, Miss Grant. I have my reasons. Now, are"
1382,"you coming, or do you really wish to vegetate in this hole for the rest"
1383,of your natural? 
1384,JO: Very well. I'll come. 
1385,"MASTER: Excellent! The prisoner and I are ready to leave now, guard. "
1386,JO: Anywhere is better than here. 
1387, [Penal colony association area]
1388,
1389," DOCTOR: Well, there you are. There you have it."
1390,That's how I came to be here. 
1391,"PATEL: It's fantastic! I mean, our people seeing Draconians, Draconians"
1392,seeing Earthmen. I can't believe it. 
1393,"DALE: Well, I can. "
1394,"DOCTOR: Good grief. Do you know, sir, you're the first person who's"
1395,believed me? 
1396,DALE: It would explain a great deal. After the stupidity of the
1397,"Draconian war, the bitterness eventually died down and we had many"
1398,"years of peace. There were trade treaties, cultural exchanges and then"
1399,"for no reason at all, these sudden acts of hostility. "
1400,(A warder and Cross enter.) 
1401,WARDER: Dale! Over here! 
1402,"DALE: Yes, what is it? "
1403,WARDER: Spot check. You ought to know. 
1404,DALE: If you'll excuse me. One of our little prison rituals. 
1405,"(Cross searches Dale, whilst muttering under his breath.) "
1406,CROSS: (sotto) This is it. There's a VIP landing in his spaceship in
1407,"ten minutes time, bay seven. You can pinch it. I've set up two space"
1408,suits for you. 
1409,DALE: (sotto) I can't believe it. 
1410,"CROSS: (sotto) Well, I keep my promises, now you keep yours. When you"
1411,"get back to Earth, don't forget who your friends are. "
1412,"DALE: (sotto_ When the Peace Party takes over, you'll be given a free"
1413,pardon. You have my word. 
1414,"CROSS: Right, you're clean. Report to airlock three for maintenance"
1415,"work. You and one other. You can choose him yourselves, okay? "
1416,DOCTOR: What is it? What's up? 
1417,"DALE: Oh, just a search. All part of the routine. "
1418,(Cross and the warder leave.) 
1419,"DOCTOR: Come on, Professor. Come on. You were giving off conspiracy in"
1420,"waves over there. You can trust me, you know. "
1421,"DALE: The escape plan. It's now. We have to walk from the airlock,"
1422,across the moon's surface. We are going to steal a spaceship. They have
1423,left two spacesuits for us. 
1424,DOCTOR: Who are you taking with you? 
1425,"DALE: Well, I had planned to take another member of the Peace Party"
1426,"committee, but I'm afraid he'll have to give up his place. Doctor, I"
1427,want you to come with me. 
1428,"DOCTOR: Well that's very generous of you, but "
1429,DALE: We must get you back to Earth so that you can tell your story. 
1430,"DOCTOR: Well, it was telling my story on Earth that got me sent here in"
1431,the first place. 
1432,"DALE: We have contacts everywhere. Journalists, broadcasters, even"
1433,friends in the government. We'll make them believe you. 
1434,"DOCTOR: Thank you, Professor. You don't know what it means to me to"
1435,have found allies at last. 
1436,"DALE: Well, we'd better be going, Doctor. This spaceship will be"
1437,landing any moment.
1438,
1439, [Outside the Lunar airlock]
1440,
1441, DALE: Good! He's left it open.
1442,
1443, [Lunar airlock]
1444,
1445, (The Doctor shuts the door behind them as Dale
1446,goes over to the oxygen units.) 
1447,"DALE: Excellent! Excellent! Come on, Doctor, we haven't got long. "
1448,DOCTOR: Take this one? 
1449,(They start to climb into space suits.) 
1450,DALE: We can't use the main entrance to the space port. It's too well
1451,guarded. All we have to do is to walk across the moon's surface. About
1452,ten minutes and we're there. 
1453,"DOCTOR: Tell me, Professor, why is Cross helping you? "
1454,"DALE: A kind of bribery, I'm afraid. I promised to get him a free"
1455,pardon once we get into power. 
1456,DOCTOR: That's extraordinary. I would have thought he would have wanted
1457,something far more positive than promises.
1458,
1459, [Outside the Lunar airlock]
1460,
1461," DALE : Oh, he's not a bad fellow when you get"
1462,to know him.
1463,
1464, [Lunar airlock]
1465,
1466," DALE: I appealed to his better self. Now do hurry,"
1467,Doctor. 
1468,"(Outside, Cross looks through a panel in the door then goes to a large"
1469,dial on the wall and turns it. Dale and the Doctor are fully suited
1470,up.) 
1471,DOCTOR: What's that? I thought I heard something. 
1472,"DALE: Yes. Now, Doctor, clip my cylinder on the back of my suit and"
1473,then I'll fix up yours. 
1474,DOCTOR: All right. 
1475,(The Doctor picks up an oxygen pack.) 
1476,"DOCTOR: Well, this one's empty. "
1477,DALE: It can't be. 
1478,"DOCTOR: Well, it certainly is. Take a look for yourself. There, look at"
1479,"the gauge. Yes, and so is this one. They're both empty, Professor. "
1480,(Cross turns the dial outside again and the liquid in a tube rises
1481,rapidly as the pressure drops.) 
1482,DOCTOR: The door. It's locked! 
1483,DALE: Listen. 
1484,"DOCTOR: They're depressurising. Don't you understand, man? They're"
1485,pumping out the air! 
1486, Episode Four
1487,
1488, [Lunar airlock]
1489,
1490, DALE: We're going to suffocate! 
1491,(The Doctor hits the door with one of the empty cylinders.) 
1492,DALE: That's no good. They'll never hear us. 
1493,DOCTOR: They certainly won't if we don't try. 
1494,DALE: Help! Help! Help! 
1495,"DOCTOR: Professor, don't shout. You'll just waste oxygen. "
1496,(Dale collapses.) 
1497,"DOCTOR: Come on, Professor, come on. Come on, up you get. "
1498,"(Outside, a hand in a black glove turns the pressure dial back.) "
1499,"DOCTOR: Listen. Listen, it worked! "
1500,(The inner airlock door opens.) 
1501,"MASTER: I do hope that you're all right, Doctor. "
1502,"DOCTOR: You. Yes, I might have guessed. "
1503,"MASTER: I'd hate you to come to any harm, you know/"
1504,
1505, [Governor's office]
1506,
1507, DOCTOR: It was a deliberate attempt at
1508,"cold-blooded murder, Governor. And I demand an enquiry. "
1509,GOVERNOR: You were trying to escape. You've only yourselves to blame
1510,for the consequences. 
1511,DOCTOR: I also believe there was a conspiracy to destroy this man
1512,because he's politically dangerous to you. 
1513,GOVERNOR: How dare you! 
1514,"DALE: Cross said he would help us to escape, and he left spacesuits for"
1515,us in the airlock. 
1516,DOCTOR: With no oxygen in the cylinders. 
1517,GOVERNOR: Is there any truth in this? 
1518,"CROSS: No, sir. They stole the suits. Must have messed it up and taken"
1519,ones with empty cylinders. 
1520,DOCTOR: And I take it we that also locked ourselves in the airlock from
1521,the outside and switched off the air supply? 
1522,"MASTER: He does have a point there, you know, Governor? Had it not been"
1523,for my time 
1524,"CROSS: Maybe another prisoner did it? You know, one who had it in for"
1525,them? 
1526,GOVERNOR: You are both guilty of attempting to escape. You'll both be
1527,placed in solitary confinement for the next year. 
1528,"MASTER: Er, just a moment, Governor. Do what you will with the old man"
1529,but that one comes with me. 
1530,"GOVERNOR: Out of the question, I'm afraid. He's committed an internal"
1531,offence and is subject to prison discipline. Take them away. 
1532,(Dale and the Doctor are led out by warders.) 
1533,"CROSS: Sorry about this, sir. I'll see it doesn't happen again. "
1534,"GOVERNOR: Yes, it had better not. All right, you can go. "
1535,CROSS: Sir. 
1536,(Cross leaves.) 
1537,"MASTER: You know, I do wish that you'd reconsider, Governor. Obtaining"
1538,custody of that prisoner is very important to me. And I do have a
1539,warrant. 
1540,"GOVERNOR: It's out of the question, I'm afraid. You see, he's under"
1541,"punishment. When he's completed his solitary confinement, I'll"
1542,reconsider. 
1543,"MASTER: I see. You know, I have a theory about this incident. "
1544,GOVERNOR: It's no concern of yours. 
1545,MASTER: I think that those two prisoners were telling the truth. I
1546,"think that your trusty, Cross, was helping them. "
1547,GOVERNOR: Why should he do that? 
1548,MASTER: On your instructions. 
1549,GOVERNOR: That is an outrageous suggest 
1550,"MASTER: Oh come, Governor. You rid yourself of a politically dangerous"
1551,"prisoner, and foster the legend that escape is impossible in one go. I"
1552,must congratulate you. 
1553,GOVERNOR: You're being very impermanent. 
1554,MASTER: Suppose I were to support the Doctor's demand for an official
1555,enquiry? Some very awkward questions could be asked. 
1556,GOVERNOR: I have nothing to fear. 
1557,"MASTER: Haven't you? Oh, come, Governor. Hand the Doctor over to me and"
1558,I promise you he'll be no further trouble to you. 
1559,"GOVERNOR: Well, I've no wish to be uncooperative. What would you do"
1560,with him? 
1561,"MASTER: Oh, take him back to Sirius 4 and see that he stands trial. You"
1562,wouldn't believe the list of crimes he's committed.
1563,
1564, [Solitary confinement]
1565,
1566,(The Governor and the Master enter.) 
1567,GOVERNOR: I'm releasing you into the custody of this Commissioner. He
1568,will fly you back to Sirius 4 to stand trial. 
1569,DOCTOR: And may I ask what I'm supposed to have done there? 
1570,"MASTER: Defrauding the Sirius 4 Dominion Bank, evasion of planetary"
1571,income tax. Assault and battery committed upon the person of a Sirius 4
1572,police official. Taking a spaceship without authority and piloting the
1573,said spaceship without payment of tax and insurance. Landing the said
1574,spaceship on an unauthorised area of Sirius 3. Need I go on? 
1575,"DOCTOR: I seem to be quite the master criminal, don't I? You don't mean"
1576,"to say that you really believe all this nonsense, do you, Governor?"
1577,Whatever credentials that he's shown you are forged. 
1578,"MASTER: Oh come, Doctor, you know the game's up. Why not admit defeat?"
1579,"You know, this man always works with an accomplice. A girl. I've got"
1580,"her under lock and key in my ship. Well, Doctor, are you coming"
1581,quietly?
1582,
1583, [Police spaceship brig]
1584,
1585,(In a hold is a barred cage with two beds. Jo is
1586,"there. The Doctor is brought in, wearing his usual clothes.) "
1587,"DOCTOR: Hello, Jo. "
1588,JO: Doctor! 
1589,DOCTOR: How are you? All right? 
1590,JO: Well 
1591,"MASTER: Right, they'll be plenty of time for the exchange of social"
1592,pleasantries. Put him inside. 
1593,"(A guard opens the cage, the Doctor enters and is locked in.) "
1594,"MASTER: Thank you, gentlemen. You can leave them to me now. "
1595,(The guards leave.) 
1596,"MASTER: Well, Doctor, this is an interesting reversal. I remember your"
1597,once visiting me when I was in prison. 
1598,"DOCTOR: You know, I'd very much like to know why? "
1599,MASTER: Why you've been locked up? 
1600,DOCTOR: No. Why I'm still alive. 
1601,"MASTER: Oh, your health is very precious to me, for the moment. You"
1602,"see, my employers are most interested in you. "
1603,JO: The Ogrons? 
1604,"MASTER: Miss Grant, please. I employ them. "
1605,"DOCTOR: Yes, well whatever it is you're up to, you needn't expect any"
1606,help from me. 
1607,MASTER: I don't need any help. Your simple presence will be quite
1608,"enough. Oh, by the way, I need hardly warn you there is no point in"
1609,"trying to escape. This is an interplanetary police spaceship, specially"
1610,"built for carrying prisoners, as you can see. "
1611,"DOCTOR: Stolen, of course? "
1612,"MASTER: Of course. Oh, and another thing. There's a closed circuit"
1613,"television camera trained on you from up there, so you will be under"
1614,"continuous observation. I think that's all. Well now, if you'll excuse"
1615,"me, I have some rather complicated astro-navigational calculations to"
1616,work out. 
1617,"DOCTOR: Er, may I ask where we're going? "
1618,"MASTER: Certainly. To the home of our friends, the Ogrons. A barren and"
1619,uninteresting planet on the remote fringes of the galaxy. 
1620,JO: Why are you taking us there? 
1621,"MASTER: That, Miss Grant, you will discover when you arrive. "
1622,(The Master leaves.) 
1623,"DOCTOR: Right, now listen to me. We haven't got much time before he"
1624,"gets back to the flight deck. Now, the first thing we've got to do is"
1625,"to escape. Now they took my sonic screwdriver from me in the prison,"
1626,but they didn't get a hold of this. 
1627,(The Doctor takes a piece of wire from his boot.) 
1628,DOCTOR: A steel file. 
1629,"JO: Right, let's go. "
1630,"DOCTOR: No, not yet. Let's wait until he gets back to the flight deck,"
1631,"then he'll set the controls. Now, this is an automatic spaceship. Once"
1632,"we're underway, the computers take over, right? "
1633,"JO: Okay, so what's the plan? "
1634,DOCTOR: Now this is what we're going to do.
1635,
1636, [Police spaceship bridge]
1637,
1638, (It has the same layout as the cargo ship. The
1639,Master changes a numerical display from 46487 to 68110 and straps
1640,"himself in, then makes a ship-wide broadcast.) "
1641,"MASTER: Right, you'd better hold in there, you two. We're about to lift"
1642,off. 
1643,(And does so at 04 40. At 04 49 the Master turns on the sound from the
1644,"CCTV and eavesdrops on the Doctor and Jo, as promised.) "
1645,DOCTOR : So I told the High Council of the Time Lords. I
1646,said they had absolutely no right to put me on trial in the first
1647,"place. Well, if I chose to go wandering around the universe in my own"
1648,time
1649,
1650, [Police spaceship brig]
1651,
1652, DOCTOR: That was my business. 
1653,JO: What about stealing the Tardis? 
1654,DOCTOR: I didn't steal it. I just borrowed it. I fully intended to
1655,"return it, I assure you. Anyway, she wasn't exactly the latest model,"
1656,poor old thing. 
1657,JO: You can say that again. 
1658,"DOCTOR: I'll tell you, I made a complete fool of that prosecuting"
1659,"council, though. I ridiculed his every argument. Yes, and I told him"
1660,that I had the complete answer to every one his charges against me. 
1661,"(And behind his back, the Doctor is using his steel wire on a hinge of"
1662,the cage door.) 
1663,JO: And then what happened? 
1664,"DOCTOR: Then what happened. Well, they found me guilty, changed my"
1665,appearance and exiled me to Earth. 
1666,JO: And that's where you met me.
1667,
1668, [Police spaceship bridge]
1669,
1670, DOCTOR : That's right. That's where I
1671,"met you. And that alone made the exile worth while, Miss Grant. "
1672,JO : Thank you. 
1673,"DOCTOR : Not that there's anything wrong with Earth. Well,"
1674,"it's quite a nice little planet in its own way, but after all, I am a"
1675,"Time Lord, Jo, and I think I deserve my freedom. "
1676,JO : Right. 
1677,"MASTER: In reminiscent mood, are you, Doctor? Poor Miss Grant - you"
1678,have my deepest sympathy. 
1679,(The Master settles down to read the War of the Worlds by HG Wells.)
1680,
1681, [Police spaceship brig]
1682,
1683," DOCTOR: As I soon realised, the trouble with"
1684,Lethbridge Stewart is that he's got a military mind. 
1685,"JO: Well, he is a Brigadier, after all. I mean, what do you expect? "
1686,"DOCTOR: No, that's the trouble though. He's hidebound, you see. He"
1687,"always does everything by the rules. I keep telling him. I said, there"
1688,"are times, you know, when you've simply got to cut right through the"
1689,red tape. 
1690,"JO: And you managed to do that, have you? "
1691,"DOCTOR: Yes, I've managed to cut right through it. "
1692,(Right through the hinge.) 
1693,DOCTOR: And I'm not going to let authority stand between me and my
1694,freedom. 
1695,(Jo takes the hint and stands directly in front of the CCTV.) 
1696,"JO: Lethbridge-Stewart, how I. Hey! As far as he's concerned "
1697, [Police spaceship bridge]
1698,
1699,(It is 05 09.) 
1700,JO : I've been absent without leave all this time. I'm
1701,always telling you that you've no idea where you're going in 
1702, [Police spaceship brig]
1703,
1704," JO: That Tardis of yours. I mean, you're supposed"
1705,"to be getting me back to Earth, right? And we keep landing up in one"
1706,terrible situation after the other. 
1707,(The cell door opens.) 
1708,"JO: I mean, when I get back, I'll probably be court-martialled, and"
1709,"then I'll be put in a cell again. That's if we do get back, and the way"
1710,"things are going, it doesn't look like it. But if we do get back, I'm"
1711,"telling you one thing, right here and now. "
1712,(The Doctor has crawled out of camera range and starts to undress.) 
1713,JO: I'm never going back in that Tardis with you again. But if we do
1714,"get back, I really do think you ought to be a bit more reasonable with"
1715,the Master. 
1716,(Jo is now talking to a bunch of pillows under a blanket while the
1717,Doctor get into a spacesuit.) 
1718,"JO: I mean, he keeps offering you a share in the galaxy, or whatever's"
1719,"going on, and you keep refusing him and playing dirty tricks on him."
1720,"But, you see, the trouble is with you is, well, you're so stiff-necked."
1721,"I mean, you've got to realise that this time"
1722,
1723, [Police spaceship bridge]
1724,
1725,(The Master has his back to the monitor and is
1726,still reading.) 
1727,JO : The Master has won. You might as well make the best
1728,"out of a terrible situation. I mean, look at it now. Here we are "
1729,(The Master turns the volume down to barely audible.) 
1730,JO : This ship. Goodness knows where he's taking us to. I
1731,"mean, just a few of those Ogrons is bad enough. Can you imagine, I"
1732,"mean, imagine a whole planet of them?"
1733,
1734, [Police spaceship brig]
1735,
1736," JO: Still, I suppose I suppose it's all my own"
1737,"fault really. I mean, if I hadn't asked my uncle to pull those strings"
1738,"and get me that job, I'd never have landed up in this mess in the first"
1739,place. 
1740,(The Doctor is suited up and holding helmet and oxygen pack.) 
1741,"JO: You know, some people think that it's very romantic working in"
1742,"intelligence. Oh, but my goodness, I could tell you it's not. "
1743,"(Jo stands up to block the camera's view of the brig again, and the"
1744,Doctor crawls round to the airlock.) 
1745,"JO: I mean, they that I run around all day with terrific-looking James"
1746,Bond types going to suave dinner parties. 
1747,"(The Doctor opens the airlock and steps inside, waving goodbye.) "
1748,"JO: Oh, but I don't, you know. I mean, either I'm with the Brigadier"
1749,"and I'm doing the filing at HQ, which is very, very difficult, or else"
1750,"I'm running around making tea and being general dogsbody. I mean, the"
1751,times come really when I'm

1753,spaceship's hull.) 
1754,
1755, [Police spaceship bridge]
1756,
1757, (The Master continues reading while Jo whitters on
1758,faintly in the background. Then a light flashes on the navigation panel
1759,and the Master has to pay attention.) 
1760,"MASTER: You'd better hold on again, you two in there. Doctor, Miss"
1761,"Grant, I'm going to make rather a sharp course correction."
1762,
1763, [Police spaceship brig]
1764,
1765, MASTER : It'll only last a moment. (The
1766,"engines fire and Doctor loses his grip on the external ladder, floating"
1767,off into space a short distance. It is 05 35 according to the bridge
1768,clock. The Doctor disconnects his air hose and turns up the pressure to
1769,use it as a jet to push himself back to the ship's hull.) 
1770, [Police spaceship bridge]
1771,
1772, (05 37.) 
1773,"MASTER: Is everything all right, Miss Grant?"
1774,
1775, [Police spaceship brig]
1776,
1777," JO: Yes. Yes, I'm fine. "
1778,MASTER : You appear a little distressed. 
1779,"JO: No. I'm, I'm just a bit shaken, that's all. "
1780,"MASTER : Yes, I can "
1781, [Police spaceship bridge]
1782,
1783," MASTER: Quite understand. And how about you,"
1784,"Doctor? No ill effects, I hope? (silence) Doctor, are you all right? "
1785,"JO : Please don't wake him. He's, he's fast asleep. "
1786,MASTER: Is he? How very relaxed of him. (The Master gets a hand weapon
1787,from a cupboard and leaves. The Doctor has reconnected his air hose and
1788,"is climbing up the spaceship to an access hatch, which he opens easily,"
1789,and climbs inside.)
1790,
1791, [Police spaceship brig]
1792,
1793, JO: (trying not to cry) You really ought to be
1794,"more careful, Doctor. I mean, I know there's a lot of, a lot of evil in"
1795,"the universe, but you can't help to put it all right by yourself. I"
1796,"mean, one of these days your luck will run out and you'll get yourself"
1797,killed. 
1798,"MASTER: Thank you, Miss Grant, we'll let you know. Where's the Doctor?"
1799,
1800, [Police spaceship bridge]
1801,
1802,(The Doctor is opening a hatch in the ceiling and
1803,checking that the room is empty.) 
1804,"MASTER : I say, he has been busy, hasn't he? Where is he, Miss"
1805,Grant? 
1806,JO : He's gone. 
1807,MASTER  I see. He found a spacesuit and he's gone into the airlock.
1808,Is that it?
1809,
1810, [Police spaceship brig]
1811,
1812, (The Master is in the cage with Jo.) 
1813,MASTER: Why? What's his plan? 
1814,JO: He wanted to get to the flight deck. He was outside the ship when
1815,you made your course correction! 
1816,MASTER: Was he now. How very unfortunate. By now he's probably
1817,"thousands of miles away, swimming around in space by himself. But just"
1818,"in case he isn't, you come with me, Miss Grant. Come on. "
1819,(The Master pulls Jo out of the cage and over to the airlock.) 
1820,"MASTER: Right, in you go, Miss Grant. "
1821,(The Master locks Jo in the airlock.) 
1822,"MASTER: Can you hear me, Doctor?"
1823,
1824, [Police spaceship bridge]
1825,
1826, MASTER : Are you on the flight deck?
1827,"If so, listen to this. Miss Grant is in the airlock. "
1828,(The Doctor is not there to hear.)
1829,
1830, [Police spaceship brig]
1831,
1832, MASTER: Unless you surrender yourself to me
1833,"immediately, I shall open the outer door and hurl her into space. "
1834,(The Doctor has taken off the spacesuit and entered the brig area. He
1835,twists something long into a whip and cracks it down on the Master's
1836,"hand, making him drop his weapon.) "
1837,"MASTER: What an ingenious fellow you are, Doctor. "
1838,(Another very large spaceship is approaching them.) 
1839,"DOCTOR: Oh, no you don't! "
1840,"(The Doctor stops the Master retrieving his weapon, then they both run"
1841,over to the airlock door. The Doctor uses his whip to drive the Master
1842,away from the controls.) 
1843,JO : Let me out! Please let me out!
1844,
1845, [Police spaceship airlock]
1846,
1847," JO: Doctor! Please let me out, somebody!"
1848,
1849, [Police spaceship brig]
1850,
1851," (The Master manages to get the Doctor to fall, and"
1852,puts his hand on the airlock controls.) 
1853,"MASTER: Now hold it, Doctor, hold it! Get that blaster over to me or I"
1854,press this button and that'll be the end of Miss Grant. 
1855,(The Doctor fetches the blaster.) 
1856,"MASTER: Thank you, Doctor. "
1857,(The spaceship jolts.) 
1858,DOCTOR: Hello. We appear to have company. 
1859,(A Draconian enters the airlock from the other ship.) 
1860,DOCTOR: Would these be your Ogron friends? 
1861,"MASTER: Why, no, no. "
1862,"DOCTOR: Well, I should try and be a bit more hospitable, old chap. Come"
1863,"on, put that gun away. They've probably got us outnumbered. "
1864,"(The inner airlock door opens and the Draconian enters, followed by"
1865,Jo.) 
1866,MASTER: Welcome on board my ship. To what do I owe the honour? 
1867,CAPTAIN: Why have you violated the Draconian frontier? 
1868,"MASTER: Yes, I'm most apologetic about that, but it was really beyond"
1869,"my control. You see, my prisoners were trying to escape and my ship was"
1870,thrown off course. 
1871,CAPTAIN: Prisoners? 
1872,"MASTER: Yes, I am the Commissioner of Earth's Interplanetary Police."
1873,I'm taking these two people back to planet Sirius 4 for trial. Here is
1874,my warrant of authority. 
1875,DOCTOR: Now don't believe this man. He's lying. 
1876,CAPTAIN: I'm not concerned in disputes between Earthmen. Owing to the
1877,"many insults and outrages committed against the empire of Draconia, a"
1878,state of emergency exists and all diplomatic relations have been
1879,severed. You have violated Draconian space. The penalty is death. 
1880,MASTER: I insist on speaking to higher authority! 
1881,CAPTAIN: You are in Draconian space. I am the authority here. 
1882,"DOCTOR: Captain, you cannot condemn us without a trial. Now I have"
1883,vital information for your Emperor. At least give me the chance to
1884,speak to him. 
1885,CAPTAIN: We shall take them to Draconia. Put them in the cage. 
1886,MASTER: But you can't do that! I'm a Commissioner of Interplanetary
1887,"Police. This is my spaceship! I tell you, you can't do that! "
1888,"(The two spaceships separate. Jo, the Doctor and the Master are in the"
1889,cage with two Draconians standing guard.) 
1890,"DOCTOR: Well, personally I'm quite happy to be going to Draconia, Jo."
1891,Perhaps we can convince the Emperor what our friend here has been
1892,trying to do. 
1893,MASTER: You really think he'd believe you? 
1894,"DOCTOR: Well, this won't be my first visit to Draconia, you know? Many"
1895,"years ago, I spent quite some time there. I was able to help them"
1896,through a period of very great difficulty. 
1897,"MASTER: Huh! Displaying your usual sickening lovability, I suppose. "
1898,"JO: So there's a good chance that they'll believe you, huh? "
1899,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a long time ago. Things may have changed. But I do"
1900,"understand the Draconian mentality, Jo. It all depends how you approach"
1901,them. 
1902,"JO: So, if they do believe the Doctor, you've had it. "
1903,"MASTER: Perhaps, Miss Grant, perhaps. But one never knows when help may"
1904,"be at hand. Now, if you'll excuse me, I think that this is going to be"
1905,"rather a long journey, so, er, goodnight. "
1906,"(The Master lies on a bunk with his back to everyone, and starts up a"
1907,small signalling device.) 
1908,DOCTOR: We'll wake you with a cup of tea in the morning. 
1909,MASTER: Thank you. 
1910,(The Master's signal is detected by an Ogron spaceship.) 
1911, Episode Five
1912,
1913, [Police spaceship brig]
1914,
1915, (The Draconian Captain is piloting the Master's
1916,stolen spaceship as the course correction light flashes. The ship
1917,jolts.) 
1918,"DOCTOR: Well, that's it then. Come on, we've landed. "
1919,"JO: Oh, hadn't we better wake our cellmate? "
1920,DOCTOR: He's awake already. He's just trying to show us how unconcerned
1921,he is. 
1922,"MASTER: How well you know me, Doctor! Now come on, smarten yourselves"
1923,"up. We want to look our best for a royal audience, you know. "
1924,JO: He's very confident. 
1925,"MASTER: Well, Miss Grant, as an Earth poet once said, 'My strength is"
1926,"as the strength of ten because my heart is pure'. Come on, you fellows,"
1927,let me out! Your Emperor is waiting to see me.
1928,
1929,[Throne room]
1930,
1931, (The Emperor sits on his throne. The Draconians do
1932,"like the colour green, it is everywhere.) "
1933,"PRINCE: So, father, once more Earthmen have invaded our space. "
1934,EMPEROR: You will address the Emperor in a proper manner! 
1935,PRINCE: Your pardon. May I have permission to address the Emperor? 
1936,(The Prince kisses his father's hand.) 
1937,PRINCE: My life at your command. 
1938,"EMPEROR: One day, my son, you will inherit this throne. Then you will"
1939,"realise the importance of due formality. Now, what do you wish to say? "
1940,PRINCE: Surely now you will declare war upon the Earthmen? Let me lead
1941,your battlefleets to crush their 
1942,"EMPEROR: They too have battlefleets, my son. Such a war could well"
1943,bring down both empires. 
1944,"PRINCE: Not if we strike first, then we shall be the victors! "
1945,"EMPEROR: In such a war, there are no victors. "
1946,PRINCE: The nobles of the court are demanding action. They fear for the
1947,honour of Draconia. 
1948,EMPEROR: I am the Emperor. The honour of Draconia is vested in me. 
1949,PRINCE: The throne depends upon the great families for support.
1950,Emperors have been deposed before now. 
1951,EMPEROR: An Emperor who does not rule deposes himself. 
1952,"PRINCE: Then what will you do, father? "
1953,EMPEROR: I shall question these Earthmen myself. I have already sent
1954,for them. 
1955,PRINCE: Why waste time listening to their lies? 
1956,"(The Captain enters, leading the Master, the Doctor and Jo.) "
1957,"CAPTAIN: Majesty, I bring you the prisoners. "
1958,DOCTOR: May I have permission to address the Emperor? 
1959,EMPEROR: Wait! 
1960,PRINCE: This is an insult! 
1961,(The Doctor bows over the Emperor's hand.) 
1962,"DOCTOR: My life at your command, sire. "
1963,PRINCE: How dare you address the Emperor in a manner reserved for a
1964,noble of Draconia? 
1965,"DOCTOR: Ah, but I am a noble of Draconia. The honour was conferred on"
1966,me by the fifteenth Emperor. 
1967,PRINCE: The fifteenth Emperor reigned five hundred years ago. 
1968,"MASTER: Your Majesty, do not be taken in by this ridiculous story. "
1969,EMPEROR: Be silent! There is a legend among our people of a man who
1970,assisted the fifteenth Emperor at a time of great trouble when we were
1971,almost overwhelmed by a great plague from outer space. But you could
1972,not be that man. No Earthman lives so long. 
1973,"DOCTOR: Your Majesty, this man that you speak of, was he not known as"
1974,the Doctor? And did he not come to this planet in a spaceship called
1975,the Tardis? 
1976,EMPEROR: He did. 
1977,"DOCTOR: Well, I am that man, sire. And I come from a race of people"
1978,that live far longer than any Earthman. 
1979,"EMPEROR: Even if I accept your claim, you have broken our law. Why did"
1980,you violate Draconian space? 
1981,"MASTER: Your Majesty, this man was, and still is, my prisoner. "
1982,"DOCTOR: It is true, your Majesty. I did come here as a prisoner, but I"
1983,"came willingly, in order to warn you that this man is plotting a war"
1984,between Earth and Draconia. 
1985,PRINCE: All Earthmen are determined upon war. 
1986,"DOCTOR: Ah, but the Master is not an Earthman. I'm sorry to have to"
1987,"admit it, but he's a renegade of my own race, and he's using creatures"
1988,called Ogrons to attack your spaceships and those of the Earthmen. 
1989,"EMPEROR: The Earthmen who attacked our spaceships, they have been seen"
1990,many times. 
1991,"DOCTOR: I'm sorry, but there you are in error, sir. Your people have"
1992,"seen Ogrons, but they appear to them as Earthmen because of a hypnotic"
1993,device. 
1994,"JO: It's true, your Majesty. When Ogrons attacked the Earth ships, the"
1995,Earthmen saw them as Draconians. 
1996,PRINCE: Silence! Females are not permitted to speak in the presence of
1997,the Emperor. 
1998,"MASTER: Your Majesty, do not be deceived by the pathetic ravings of two"
1999,criminals trying to evade justice. 
2000,"EMPEROR: If what you say is true, it would explain much. We lived at"
2001,"peace with the Earthmen for many years, then suddenly they began to"
2002,"raid our spaceships. When we protested, they said that we were"
2003,attacking them. 
2004,"PRINCE: In order to cover up their own attacks, This is simply a plot"
2005,of the Earthmen to lull us into false security. 
2006,(A Messenger enters.) 
2007,EMPEROR: Speak! 
2008,"MESSENGER: Your Majesty, a spaceship from Earth seeks permission to"
2009,land in the palace spaceport. They say they're on a special mission
2010,from the President of Earth. 
2011,PRINCE: This is a trick! You must not allow them to land! 
2012,EMPEROR: We are not yet at war with Earth. I shall hear what their
2013,President has to say. I give my permission. 
2014,MESSENGER: Your Majesty. 
2015,(The Messenger leaves.) 
2016,"DOCTOR: A wise decision, your Majesty. For only by Earth and Draconia"
2017,working together can we hope to arrive at the truth. 
2018,"MASTER: I too welcome your wisdom, your Majesty. Nobody could be more"
2019,devoted to the cause of peace than I. As a commissioner of Earth's
2020,"Interplanetary Police, I have devoted my life to the cause of law and"
2021,order. And law and order can only exist in a time of peace. 
2022,"DOCTOR: You feeling all right, old chap? "
2023,"MASTER: Only during a period of social stability, can society"
2024,adequately deal with criminals such as this man and this unfortunate
2025,girl. 
2026,"JO: Doctor, listen! That sound! "
2027,"PRINCE: Silence, female! "
2028,"JO: Quiet! It's the same noise that I heard on the cargo ship. Doctor,"
2029,it's the Ogrons! 
2030,"DOCTOR: Your Majesty, I beg of you to be cautious. Something is"
2031,"seriously wrong here. This ship that has just landed. I beg you, place"
2032,it under guard immediately. 
2033,"MASTER: Your majesty, please, I "
2034,"(Ogrons burst into the throne room, firing as they come.) "
2035,DRACONIAN: Earthmen! 
2036,"MASTER: Seize them, fool! "
2037,(The Doctor knocks out an Ogron and the Master joins the other Ogrons.)
2038,
2039,"MASTER: Bah! You idiots! Back to the ship, all of you! "
2040,(The Master and his Ogrons leave.) 
2041,PRINCE: Now will you believe in the treachery of the Earthmen? 
2042,"DOCTOR: Your Majesty, look down here and tell me. What do you see? "
2043,(The noise is still audible.) 
2044,EMPEROR: I see one of your Earth soldiers who attacked my palace and
2045,killed my people. 
2046,"DOCTOR: Jo? Jo, can you still hear that sound? "
2047,"JO: Yes, it's fading. It's almost gone. "
2048,"DOCTOR: Your Majesty, I beg of you. Please look again. "
2049,PRINCE: Why do we delay? Destroy him! 
2050,EMPEROR: Wait! He has spoken the truth. 
2051,(The Emperor can see the Ogron.)
2052,
2053, [Ogron spaceship bridge]
2054,
2055, (The spaceship has taken off from Draconia.) 
2056,MASTER: Great lumbering idiots! Now you tell me that you've left one of
2057,your fellows in the palace. Do you realise what this means? As soon as
2058,"the effect of the hypnosound wears off, the Draconians will know who it"
2059,really was who attacked them. You've ruined everything! 
2060,OGRON: What shall we do now? 
2061,MASTER: Do? There's only one thing we can do. Make sure that the Doctor
2062,and his evidence is never allowed to reach Earth.
2063,
2064, [Throne room]
2065,
2066, (The Ogron is awake and in chains.) 
2067,DOCTOR: Why does the Master want war between Earth and Draconia? 
2068,PRINCE: Did you attack our spaceships and those of the Earthmen? 
2069,"JO: Oh, it's no good. We're not getting anywhere. "
2070,PRINCE: Let me take him for questioning. He shall answer to me. I shall
2071,use the mind probe. 
2072,DOCTOR: You'd only be wasting your time. The Ogrons have got the finest
2073,defence mechanism of all. Stupidity. They haven't got a mind for you to
2074,probe. 
2075,EMPEROR: Then remove him. We will deal with him later. 
2076,(The Ogron is taken away.) 
2077,EMPEROR: Why did that sound make us see this creature as a soldier from
2078,Earth? 
2079,JO: Because you're frightened of Earthmen. 
2080,"PRINCE: Draconians fear nothing, female. "
2081,"JO: Well, of course you do. You fear them and they fear you. That's why"
2082,"when Earthmen heard that sound, they saw Draconians. "
2083,EMPEROR: That is true. We do fear the Earthmen and they fear us. 
2084,"DOCTOR: And fear breeds hatred, your Majesty. Fear is the greatest"
2085,"enemy of them all, for fear leads us to war. "
2086,EMPEROR: We shall tell the Earthmen what has happened here. They too
2087,must know the truth. 
2088,PRINCE: They will not believe us. 
2089,"DOCTOR: The Prince is right, your Majesty. We must mount an expedition"
2090,"at once, and we must take the Ogron as evidence. "
2091,PRINCE: The empires are on the verge of war. A Draconian spaceship in
2092,Earth space could be destroyed before it reaches its destination. 
2093,JO: We could use the ship that Master brought us in. It's an Earth
2094,police spaceship. 
2095,PRINCE: Females are not permitted to speak 
2096,EMPEROR: The female may speak. 
2097,PRINCE: But 
2098,"EMPEROR: We must respect the customs of our guests, strange though they"
2099,may be. The suggestion had merit. 
2100,"JO: Thank you, your Majesty. "
2101,EMPEROR: You too will go on this mission. But it must be headed by a
2102,Draconian of noble rank. I shall send my son.
2103,
2104, [Police spaceship brig]
2105,
2106, (The ship is in flight and the Ogron is in the
2107,cage.) 
2108,JO: Here you are. Brought you some food. And a delicious banana. 
2109,(The Ogron bites into it.) 
2110,"JO: I think you're supposed to peel it first. Oh well. (to guard) Hey,"
2111,"you know, you want to be very careful of him. He's not as stupid as he"
2112,"looks. I know, I know, women aren't allowed to speak. You know, I think"
2113,it's about time that women's lib was brought to Draconia.
2114,
2115, [Police spaceship bridge]
2116,
2117, (The Doctor is at the controls.) 
2118,"DOCTOR: Hello, Jo. How's your Ogron friend? "
2119,"JO: Not too happy. He seemed to enjoy his banana though. Doctor, where"
2120,are we? 
2121,DOCTOR: We're just about to cross the frontier into Earth space. 
2122,"JO: Oh, that's good. "
2123,PRINCE: Unless your Earth people destroy us. 
2124,"DOCTOR: Well, this is an Earth police spaceship, you know, sir. "
2125,JO: Even if it is stolen. 
2126,(A light is blinking on the monitor.) 
2127,PRINCE: What is that? 
2128,"DOCTOR: Well, it looks like another spaceship. It appears to be"
2129,following us.
2130,
2131, [Ogron spaceship bridge]
2132,
2133, OGRON: Look! 
2134,"MASTER: Well, that must be them. No other ship would be on a course for"
2135,Earth at a time like this. 
2136,OGRON: We are on a course for Earth. 
2137,"MASTER: Well naturally, because we're chasing them! Oh, keep quiet and"
2138,"let me think. Now, soon they'll be within striking distance. "
2139,"OGRON: What will you do, Master? "
2140,"MASTER: I'd like to try and take the Doctor alive if possible. If not,"
2141,I'll blast him out of space. Pity though. 
2142,OGRON: You do not wish to kill him? 
2143,"MASTER: Of course I do! But I don't know, rocket fire at long range,"
2144,"it's. I don't know, somehow it lacks that personal touch."
2145,
2146, [Police spaceship bridge]
2147,
2148, DOCTOR: They're closing in. Perhaps it's a
2149,frontier patrol ship coming to investigate us. 
2150,"JO: Well, can't we talk to them and tell them who we are? "
2151,"DOCTOR: We can try. We should be within audio range. Hello, this is"
2152,Earth police spaceship two three nine oh on a special mission to the
2153,"President of Earth. Do you read me, do you read me? Over."
2154,
2155, [Ogron spaceship bridge]
2156,
2157, DOCTOR : This is Earth police spaceship two
2158,three nine oh on a special mission to the President of Earth. Do you
2159,"read me, do you read me? Over. "
2160,"(The Master disguises his voice slightly, and the static does the"
2161,rest.) 
2162,MASTER: This is Earth police spaceship number one four two. Your ship
2163,is one that has been reported as stolen. You will please reduce speed
2164,so that we can board you.
2165,
2166, [Police spaceship bridge]
2167,
2168," DOCTOR: Hello, Earth police spaceship one four"
2169,"two. (sotto) I think there'll be trouble over this. (normal) Hello,"
2170,we've recaptured this ship and are taking it back to Earth. Over. 
2171,MASTER : Reduce speed immediately so that we can board you. 
2172,PRINCE: Why should we submit to this delay? Our mission has diplomatic
2173,immunity. 
2174,"DOCTOR: Yes, but they, unfortunately, didn't know that, did they?"
2175,"Hello, Earth police spaceship, we are reducing speed as you request,"
2176,over. 
2177,"JO: Doctor, are you sure? We don't really know if it's the police. "
2178,"DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. That's why I want to get them into visual scanner"

2183," MASTER: Right, they've reduced speed. They should"
2184,be within striking distance now. That's about it. Release the first
2185,missile! 
2186,(The Ogron presses the big red button and two missiles are fired.)
2187,
2188, [Police spaceship bridge]

2190, DOCTOR: We should be able to pick them up on the
2191,visual scanner now. 
2192,JO: It's an Ogron ship! 
2193,(Boom.) 
2194,DOCTOR: Hold tight! I'm taking evasive action.

2207,disposed of its Draconian guard.)

2216,"DOCTOR: No. No, I'm afraid we're outgunned. This isn't a battlecruiser,"
2217,you know. 
2218,(Boom.) 
2219,DOCTOR: Hang on. I think we're shaking them off. (The Ogron enters.) 
2220,JO: Doctor! 
2221,"DOCTOR: He's broken out! Get out, Jo! "

2223,throttle control on the console.)

2225, [Ogron spaceship bridge]

2228,speed. 
2229,OGRON: Shall I fire again? 
2230,"MASTER: No, no, it might be possible to take the Doctor alive after"
2231,all. Muster a boarding party. 
2232,"OGRON 2: Yes, Master."

2247, [Police spaceship bridge]

2268,that ship by now! Must I do everything myself? 
2269,OGRON: Look! 
2270,(A third spaceship is on the monitor.) 
2271,MASTER: An Earth battlecruiser. You'd better recall the boarding party.
2272,"I'll take over here. As soon as they're back on board, we'll unlock."

2291, [Police spaceship brig]
2292,
2293, (The Ogron ship speeds away without having closed
2294,the police spaceship airlock door. The Doctor and the Prince struggle
2295,to hold on as the air rushes out as they make their way round the brig
2296,to the inner door. Finally the Doctor manages to pull it shut.) 
2297,DOCTOR: We should be all right in a minute. The ship'll pump in more
2298,oxygen.

2301, EARTH CAPTAIN : This is Earth battle
2302,cruiser X two nine. Do you read me? Identify yourself. This is Earth
2303,battle cruiser X two nine. Do you read me? Identify yourself.

2306,special mission to the President of Earth. Over. 
2307,EARTH CAPTAIN : Identify the ship that has just unlocked
2308,from you. They refuse to answer our signals. 
2309,"DOCTOR: Look, it's of vital importance that you pursue and capture that"
2310,ship immediately. Over. 
2311,EARTH CAPTAIN : You are in possession of a stolen police
2312,spaceship. You are under arrest. Stand by to be boarded.
2313,
2314, [Ogron spaceship bridge]
2315,
2316," DOCTOR : Look, you don't understand. The man"
2317,who stole this ship is escaping in that vessel. 
2318,EARTH CAPTAIN : You are under arrest. You'll be given the
2319,opportunity of making a full statement. Do not offer any resistance.
2320,Stand by to be boarded. 
2321,"DOCTOR : Oh, very well. We're standing by. "
2322,"MASTER: Ha, ha! Poor Doctor! Enmeshed in the throes of bureaucracy."
2323,It'll take him a long time to talk himself out of that one. 
2324,JO: But he'll get to see the President eventually. 
2325,MASTER: She won't believe him. 
2326,"JO: Oh yes, she will, when she sees the Ogron prisoner. He's our"
2327,evidence. 
2328,MASTER: Your evidence is standing right behind you. 
2329,JO: The Draconian Prince knows the truth and he's with the Doctor. 
2330,"MASTER: My dear Miss Grant, in the climate of opinion that I have"
2331,"created, do you think that any Earthman is going to believe the word of"
2332,a Draconian?
2333,
2334, [President's office]
2335,
2336," PRESIDENT: Your Highness, we've heard the Doctor's"
2337,"theory before, and, with respect, there is still no concrete evidence."
2338,"I myself would like to believe you but, as you can see, I need proof to"
2339,convince my people. 
2340,DOCTOR: Then we must mount an expedition to the planet of the Ogrons.
2341,"The proof we need is there, Madam. "
2342,"WILLIAMS: With Earth on the brink of war, how can we divert our forces"
2343,into such a pointless expedition? Suppose this is yet another Draconian
2344,trick to divide our strength? 
2345,"DOCTOR: My dear chap, I'm not asking for a battlefleet. All I require"
2346,is one small spaceship. 
2347,PRESIDENT: Your request is granted. 
2348,"WILLIAMS: On the contrary, your request is denied. "
2349,PRESIDENT: My authority 
2350,"WILLIAMS: In a purely military matter of this kind, Madam, your"
2351,authority is limited. 
2352,PRESIDENT: I can overrule you. 
2353,WILLIAMS: Only with the backing of the full Earth Senate. Do you think
2354,they will give it? 
2355,PRINCE: How can we expect help from a man such as this? This is the man
2356,who deliberately caused war between our people! 
2357,WILLIAMS: That is untrue! 
2358,"PRINCE: Twenty years ago, you destroyed a Draconian ship that had come"
2359,in a mission of peace. 
2360,WILLIAMS: A ship that was about to open fire on us when we were damaged
2361,and helpless. 
2362,PRINCE: They came in peace as had been arranged. 
2363,WILLIAMS: Then why didn't they answer my signals? 
2364,PRINCE: Their communications equipment had been destroyed in a neutron
2365,storm. The same neutron storm that damaged your ship! 
2366,PRESIDENT: Is this true? 
2367,PRINCE: I have read the records of my father's court. It is the truth. 
2368,WILLIAMS: But why a battlecruiser? The agreement was that both ships
2369,were to be unarmed. 
2370,PRINCE: Naturally we sent a cruiser. How else should a nobleman of
2371,Draconia travel? But its missile banks were empty. The ship was
2372,unarmed.
2373,
2374, [Ogron spaceship bridge]
2375,
2376," MASTER: Well, very soon we shall be landing. I"
2377,"think, Miss Grant, you had better prepare yourself for a long stay. I'm"
2378,"afraid it's not a very comfortable place, but as the old song says, 'Be"
2379,"it ever so humble, there's no place like home."
2380,
2381, [President's office]
2382,
2383," WILLIAMS: Your Highness, please accept my deepest"
2384,regrets for the wrong I have done your people. 
2385,"DOCTOR: Then can I take it, sir, that you will now authorise the"
2386,expedition? 
2387,"WILLIAMS: I intend to lead it. If the planet of the Ogrons exists, we"
2388,shall find it.
2389,
2390, [Ogron planet]
2391,
2392," (It is, of course, another quarry. Beachfields, I"
2393,believe.)

2395,(They enter a cave.)
2396,
2397, [The Master's Lair]
2398,
2399, (The main cave is brick-lined but spartan. There
2400,"is a desk and chair, a large interstellar radio set and some"
2401,miscellaneous equipment.) 
2402,"MASTER: Well, Miss Grant, welcome to my humble abode. "
2403,JO: I think you were better off in prison. 
2404,"MASTER: Oh, temporary quarters, my dear. I shall soon be changing them"
2405,for something better. 
2406,"JO: Oh, you'll soon be back in jail. When the truth gets out, Earth and"
2407,Draconia will combine their forces to attack you. 
2408,MASTER: I don't think so. There's too much distrust between them. 
2409,JO: The Doctor will find you eventually. 
2410,"MASTER: Ah, there I agree with you. He must find me. Not only to rescue"
2411,"you, but also to be reunited with his beloved Tardis. "
2412,(Which is standing in an alcove.) 
2413,"MASTER: You know, Miss Grant, I'm going to set a trap for the Doctor"
2414,and you are going to help me. What? No noble speeches to the effect
2415,that you'd rather die than betray the Doctor? 
2416,JO: You know I'm not going to help you. 
2417,MASTER: I know that you are. I know that you will obey me. You will
2418,obey me! I am the Master. 
2419,"JO: Mary had a little lamb, his fleece was white as snow, and"
2420,"everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go. "
2421,MASTER: You will obey me! 
2422,"JO: ""Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall "
2423,"MASTER: Stop that, Miss Grant! "
2424,JO: It's a form of self-conditioning. You fill your mind with nonsense
2425,and then you can't be hypnotised. 
2426,MASTER: You will obey me. 
2427,"JO: See-saw, Marjory Daw, Johnny shall have a new master. "
2428,MASTER: You will obey me. 
2429,"JO: He shall have but a penny a day, because he can't work any faster. "
2430,"MASTER: All right, all right, all right, all right! I was never very"
2431,fond of nursery rhymes anyhow. 
2432,"JO: Then you'll just have to give up all hope of hypnotising me, won't"
2433,"you? Once was quite enough, thank you. "
2434,"MASTER: In that case, I shall have to try something else. You may have"
2435,"heard this noise before, Miss Grant. It works directly on the fear"
2436,centres deep in your mind! 
2437, Episode Six
2438,
2439, [The Master's Lair]
2440,
2441, JO: It's not real! It's an illusion! 
2442,"MASTER: Then we shall have to try a little harder, Miss Grant. "
2443,JO: It's not real! 
2444,(Jo sees the Master turn into a Drashig.) 
2445,JO: It's you! It's the Master! 
2446,MASTER: You cannot shut your eyes! It is impossible! Let's try a little
2447,harder! 
2448,(The Drashig turns into a Mutant.) 
2449,JO: It's not real! It's an illusion! It's you! 
2450,(Then a Sea Devil.) 
2451,JO: It's the Master! It doesn't work on me any more! It's you! It
2452,doesn't work on me any more! It doesn't work on me any more! It 
2453,(She can see the Master clearly again.) 
2454,"MASTER: Congratulations, my dear. I seem to have failed again. "
2455,"JO: Yes, you do, don't you? Never mind. You can't win them all. "
2456,MASTER: Hmm. I shall have to think about this. I'm afraid I shall have
2457,to ask you to be my guest for a little longer. Show Miss Grant to her
2458,"room, will you? "
2459,(Two Ogrons grab Jo and take her away.) 
2460,"JO: No, let me go! No! "
2461,OGRON: Master? 
2462,"MASTER: Yes, what is it? "
2463,OGRON: Two raiding ships have returned. 
2464,MASTER: Oh? Were they successful? 
2465,OGRON: They found and attacked two Earth cargo ships. 
2466,MASTER: Where was this? 
2467,OGRON: In Earth space. One ship resisted. We destroyed it. 
2468,MASTER: Excellent! That should stir things up. It can't be long now
2469,before they declare war on each other.

2472,
2473, (An American Congressman is holding forth to a
2474,crowd in the open air somewhere on the wall screen.) 
2475,BROOK [on screen]: And I warn the President that the people of Earth
2476,will no longer tolerate these insulting and murderous attacks! I hear
2477,the cries all about me. Attack Draconia! Attack now! Earth will not
2478,produce peace at the price of humiliation! There is only one solution
2479,now! War! War! War! 
2480,(The President turns off the screen.) 
2481,PRESIDENT: I don't know how much longer I can hold them. 
2482,PRINCE: You must tell them it is not the Draconians who attack you. 
2483,"DOCTOR: Your Royal Highness, could you convince your people they were"
2484,not being attacked by Earthmen? 
2485,PRESIDENT: If only we had proof. Then I could convince my people and
2486,you could convince yours. But there's not much time. (Williams enters.)
2487,
2488,"WILLIAMS: Madam President, everything is ready. We shall use my"
2489,personal scoutship. 
2490,DOCTOR: We'd better leave at once. Madam President.

2498,Ogron brings her some food and drink then leaves.) 
2499,"JO: Thanks, cheerful. (she sniffs the bowl) Yuk. "
2500,(Jo looks at the large metal spoon she was given and tests the firmness
2501,"of the floor of the cell. It is mostly soil, so she starts digging.) "
2502, [Scoutship]
2503,
2504,(Another bridge from the same mould as all the
2505,other Earth spaceships of this era.) 
2506,"DOCTOR: Right, thirty-four seconds. A course correction to galactic"
2507,"coordinates two three four nine, six seven eight four. "
2508,WILLIAMS: You realise where that will take us? A completely uninhabited
2509,sector of the galaxy. 
2510,"DOCTOR: Well, not completely uninhabited, General Williams. That's"
2511,where the Ogron's planet is. 
2512,WILLIAMS: No doubt your information is better than mine. May I ask
2513,where you obtained it? 
2514,DOCTOR: Certainly. From the Master. He fed the coordinates into his
2515,ship's computer when I was his prisoner. And after you'd captured the
2516,"ship, sir, I extracted the information from the ship's memory banks. "
2517,WILLIAMS: We're simply wasting time. 
2518,(BOOM! and everyone staggers.) 
2519,WILLIAMS: Dragons! 
2520,PRINCE: Let me talk to them. I shall explain. 
2521,(Boom.) 
2522,DOCTOR: Somehow I don't think they're in the mood for explanations at
2523,this minute. Can you outrun them? 
2524,WILLIAMS: This ship can outrun anything. Hyperdrive. 
2525,(Boom.) 
2526,WILLIAMS: Max hyperdrive! 
2527,(The little ship zooms off at impossible speed.) 
2528,"DOCTOR: Right, we're out of range now. "
2529,"WILLIAMS: Reduce speed, return to course. "
2530,PRINCE: I regret the behaviour of my people. The officer will be
2531,punished. 
2532,"DOCTOR: Well, we were infringing Draconian space, after all, your Royal"
2533,Highness. 
2534,PILOT: General Williams? 
2535,WILLIAMS: Yes? 
2536,"PILOT: I can't get her back on course, sir. One of the drive outlets is"
2537,malfunctioning. 
2538,DOCTOR: Do you know exactly what's wrong? 
2539,PILOT: There's damage to exterior electrical circuit. 
2540,WILLIAMS: Can't you repair it? 
2541,"PILOT: It'll mean going outside, sir. "
2542,WILLIAMS: Put the ship on automatic and get out there. 
2543,"PILOT: No good, sir. I've got to control it manually. "
2544,"DOCTOR: Right, well, you hold her steady. I'll go and effect the"
2545,repairs. 
2546,"WILLIAMS: No doubt you're a qualified space engineer too, Doctor? "
2547,DOCTOR: Naturally. 
2548,(So once again the Doctor makes his way around the outside of a
2549,"spaceship, this time with the flying harness wires clearly visible, so"
2550,we can say he is on a lifeline. He unlocks a panel cover and gets to
2551,work.) 
2552,"WILLIAMS: How's it going, Doctor? "
2553,"DOCTOR : A bit of a shambles, I'm afraid. Though I'll do my best to"
2554,bodge something up. 
2555,PRINCE: Look! 
2556,(The Draconian ship is back.) 
2557,WILLIAMS: It's coming up fast. Looks as if your friends are catching up
2558,with us. 
2559,"PILOT: Once they're in range, they'll fire again. "
2560,"WILLIAMS: Doctor, there's a ship approaching."
2561,
2562, [Outside the Scoutship]
2563,

2565,long will you be?

2567,
2568, [Scoutship]  
2569,
2570, WILLIAMS: Stand by for hyperdrive. 
2571,PILOT: I can't sir. The Doctor's had to disconnect the main circuitry
2572,to make the repair. I can't boost the speed until he's finished. 
2573,"PRINCE: If my people fire, he will be killed. Let me speak to them. "
2574,WILLIAMS: Do you think they'll wait to talk? The Draconians are coming
2575,"up fast, Doctor. If you don't get that repair finished, we'll be a"
2576,sitting target.
2577,

2603, (They have arrived at the planet.) 
2604,"DOCTOR: Pilot, can you get her into a closer orbit? "
2605,"PILOT: If you want me to take her in that close, sir, we may have to"

2624,JO : Please inform the authorities. 
2625,DOCTOR: Can you boost it up? 
2626,JO : I repeat 
2627,"PILOT: I'm sorry, sir. We're nearly over the horizon. "
2628,WILLIAMS: Did you get a fix on it? 
2629,PILOT: Pretty close. I can put us down on a general area. 
2630,WILLIAMS: How long will it take us to complete the orbit? 
2631,PILOT: About twenty minutes.

2641,MASTER: Yes. I left those galactic coordinates for you to find. 
2642,JO: You mean they were fakes? 
2643,"MASTER: Oh, no, no, no. They're genuine enough. But this is a"
2644,"short-range transmitter, so no one will have picked up your message"
2645,more than two or three hundred miles from this planet. 
2646,JO: Nobody heard me. 
2647,"MASTER: On the contrary. The Doctor heard you. Yes, at this moment,"
2648,he's orbiting the planet in a small spaceship. I picked him up on radar
2649,a little while ago. 
2650,JO: How do you know it was the Doctor? 
2651,"MASTER: My dear Miss Grant, who else could it be? You see, when the"
2652,"Doctor arrives, we'll be waiting for him. So you have been useful to me"
2653,"after all. But, er, just in case the Doctor should get lost. "
2654,(The Master turns on the little device he had with him in the spaceship
2655,brig.) 
2656,"MASTER: There. Now he'll think that this homing signal comes from you,"
2657,"Miss Grant. By the way, congratulations. I knew I could count on you to"
2658,"get out of your cage. Right, take her away. And this time, make sure"
2659,that she's properly under guard. 
2660,JO: No! No! No! Stop it!
2661,
2662, [Scoutship]  
2663,
2664, WILLIAMS: How much longer? 
2665,PILOT: Two seconds to go. 
2666,WILLIAMS: We're overheating badly. 
2667,"PILOT: Yes, I know. This is it. We should pick her up again now. "
2668,PRINCE: What is that signal? 
2669,DOCTOR: Jo must have fixed up some kind of homing device. 
2670,WILLIAMS: Splendid! That'll lead us right to them. 
2671,DOCTOR: Doesn't it strike you as being a bit too convenient? 
2672,WILLIAMS: Hmm. 
2673,(There are flames coming from the hatch cover now.) 
2674,PILOT: The drive outlet circuit's gone again. 
2675,DOCTOR: Can you get her down? 
2676,PILOT: Yes. But I'm not sure where.
2677,
2678, [The Master's Lair]
2679,
2680," MASTER: Yes, they should be here very soon now."
2681,"Judging by the size of the ship, they can't be in any great force. So"
2682,conceal yourselves and ambush them as soon as they arrive. Right? 
2683,(The Ogrons turn to leave. The radar bleep stops.) 
2684,"MASTER: Hold on, wait a minute. Something's happened. They must have"
2685,"landed very nearby. Right, send out patrols! Get them and bring them"
2686,"back here immediately. And remember, I want the Doctor alive. "
2687,"OGRONS: Yes, Master."
2688,
2689, [Ogron planet] 
2690," (The rescue party come over a ridge, and the"
2691,Doctor uses a hand scanner to pick a direction. At the bottom they come
2692,upon large prints in soft ground.) 
2693,"DOCTOR: Williams, look. Another one. "
2694,WILLIAMS: One dominant lifeform. A large and savage reptile. 
2695,"DOCTOR: Yes. Well, let's hope we don't encounter one. "
2696,"WILLIAMS: Doctor, has it occurred to you what we're going to do when we"
2697,discover the source of this signal? 
2698,"DOCTOR: I've no idea, old chap. We'll find out when we get there. Come"
2699,"on, can't be far. "
2700,(An Ogron stands up from behind an outcrop and watches them move along
2701,a track. As they climb up a slope.) 
2702,OGRON: Stop! Surrender! 
2703,(Weapons fire. One soldier dies.) 
2704,WILLIAMS: Take cover! 
2705,"(The soldiers, Williams and the Prince all shoot Ogrons. Then suddenly"
2706,a large orange inflatable with bug eyes comes over the ridge and the
2707,Ogrons flee.) 
2708,WILLIAMS: What is that? 
2709,"DOCTOR: I've no idea, but whatever it is, it's on our side."
2710,
2711, [The Master's Lair]
2712,
2713, (The Master is finishing a radio broadcast.) 
2714,"MASTER: Yes, I await your arrival with the greatest of pleasure. And I"
2715,shall be there to meet you the moment that your ship touches down. 
2716,(Frightened Ogrons run in.) 
2717,MASTER: So where's the Doctor? 
2718,OGRON: The monster came! 
2719,MASTER: The monster? And I suppose you all ran like rabbits? 
2720,OGRON: We fear the monster! 
2721,"MASTER: You stupid, cowardly idiots! You will answer to your masters"
2722,for this! 
2723,OGRON: What? They are coming? 
2724,"MASTER: Yes, they are coming! Which means that I can dispense with your"
2725,doubtful assistance! Out of my way!
2726,
2727, [Ogron planet]
2728,
2729, DOCTOR: That's good. It's started again. Come on. 
2730,PRINCE: A ship! 
2731,(A dust storm is kicked up.) 
2732,PRINCE: Somebody else seems to have received the message. 
2733,"(When the dust dies down, they move on to an area with a small pond in"
2734,"it. The Doctor looks around, worried.) "
2735,WILLIAMS: What is it? 
2736,DOCTOR: I don't know. I've got a feeling. Some sort of premonition. 
2737,WILLIAMS: Doctor? 
2738,"DOCTOR: Yes, come on. "
2739,"MASTER: Hello, Doctor! "
2740,(The Master is standing on the ridgeline above them.) 
2741,"MASTER: So here you are at last, eh? "
2742,WILLIAMS: Surrender or you'll be shot down! 
2743,"DOCTOR: No, he's unarmed. "
2744,"MASTER: Unarmed maybe, but not unaccompanied. I've brought some old"
2745,friends along to meet you. 
2746,(A bevy of oversized pepperpots appear.) 
2747,MASTER: Quite a touching little reunion. You don't seem very pleased. 
2748,WILLIAMS: Fire! 
2749,(The Daleks exterminate the hapless soldiers.) 
2750,"DOCTOR: No! No, don't. It's no good."
2751,
2752, [The Master's Lair]
2753,
2754, (A Gold Dalek is in charge.) 
2755,"GOLD: Doctor, you are in our power and you will be exterminated. "
2756,"MASTER: No, not yet. "
2757,GOLD: You will obey the Daleks! 
2758,MASTER: You know as well as I do that this man does not fear death. I
2759,"want him to suffer a much worse punishment. Look, my skill and cunning"
2760,has brought about this war which will make you the masters of the
2761,"galaxy. Leave the Doctor with me, and let him see the result of that"
2762,"war. Let him see the galaxy in ruins. Let him see the planet Earth,"
2763,"that he loves so much, in ruins, then exterminate him. "
2764,GOLD: Very well. He will remain your prisoner until the war is
2765,concluded. Then you will bring him to us and we shall exterminate him.
2766,We shall now return to our base and prepare the army of the Daleks. 
2767,(The Daleks leave.) 
2768,"DOCTOR: Oh, I suppose I should thank you for saving my life? "
2769,"MASTER: Not for long, Doctor. It's going to be a very short war. Right,"
2770,take them away.
2771,
2772, [Cages]
2773,
2774,"(The Doctor is put in with Jo, Williams and the"
2775,Prince in another cage.) 
2776,"JO: Hello, Doctor. "
2777,"DOCTOR: Hello, Jo. "
2778,"JO: Oh, so now they've got all of us. "
2779,WILLIAMS: All except the pilot. He's repairing the ship. 
2780,PRINCE: Why do these Dalek creatures wish to set your people and mine
2781,at war? 
2782,"DOCTOR: Because war will mean the extermination of both empires, your"
2783,"Royal Highness, and the Daleks will emerge as the supreme rulers. Now"
2784,"somehow, we've got to get out of here and stop them. "
2785,"JO: (sotto) Doctor! Doctor, would the Master's little fear-box help? "
2786,"DOCTOR: Well done, Jo! "
2787,"JO: You see, we could use it to frighten the Ogrons away and then we"
2788,can all escape. 
2789,"WILLIAMS: Well, that's hardly practical, Miss Grant. They'd just run"
2790,off and we'd still be locked in. 
2791,JO: Oh. 
2792,"DOCTOR: There is one thing we can do, though, and it'll need a very"
2793,slight adjustment.
2794,
2795, [The Master's Lair]
2796,
2797, (The Master is on the radio again.) 
2798,MASTER: There's nothing to worry about. The Doctor will be perfectly
2799,"safe in my hands. I promise you, when I deliver him to you, he'll be a"
2800,broken man. 
2801,DALEK : Do not fail the Daleks. 
2802,MASTER: The war is certain now. And once the great empires destroy each
2803,"other, I ask but one thing. Let me rule the planet Earth in your name."
2804,
2805, [Cages]
2806,
2807," DOCTOR: General Williams, if we do manage to get"
2808,"out of here, and Jo and I manage to create a diversion, could you find"
2809,your way back to your spaceship? 
2810,WILLIAMS: Certainly. 
2811,"DOCTOR: Good. Right, that should do it. Now I want you to take off"
2812,immediately. Get the truth back to your respective governments. 
2813,PRINCE: Yes. 
2814,DOCTOR: Tell them that they must mount a joint expedition and capture
2815,this base at once. 
2816,PRINCE: I shall stay and help. 
2817,"DOCTOR: No, we'll need you to convince the Emperor, your Royal"
2818,Highness. 
2819,WILLIAMS: What about you and Miss Grant? How will you get away? 
2820,"DOCTOR: Jo, I presume that the Tardis is still here? "
2821,"JO: Yes, I know where it is. "
2822,"DOCTOR: Well, don't worry about us. Our spaceship is here. "
2823,"WILLIAMS: That's all very well, Doctor, but we still happen to be"
2824,locked in. 
2825,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, would you mind blocking your ears and covering your"
2826,eyes just for a moment? 
2827,PRINCE: I do not understand. 
2828,"DOCTOR: No, but I think you will in a moment. Just do as I ask, would"
2829,"you? You too, Jo. "
2830,"JO: Oh no, it's all right. I can resist it. "
2831,DOCTOR: Can you? 
2832,JO: Yes. 
2833,"DOCTOR: Good. Er, how much longer are you going to keep us locked in"
2834,here? 
2835,(The Ogron guard turns around.) 
2836,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm talking to you. "
2837,(The Doctor turns on the adjusted hypnosound device and turns into a
2838,Dalek.) 
2839,DOCTOR: Open the gate. Open the gate. Open the gate or I will
2840,exterminate you. 
2841,(The Ogron obeys and flees.) 
2842,DOCTOR: It worked. 
2843,(The Doctor releases Williams and the Prince.) 
2844,DOCTOR: Right. 
2845,JO: Come on then. Follow me.
2846,
2847, [The Master's Lair]
2848,
2849, DALEK : We are about to enter hyperdrive and
2850,return to our base. Do not fail the Daleks. 
2851,(Transmission ends.) 
2852,"MASTER: Right, we'll see who rules the galaxy when this is over. Do not"
2853,"fail the Daleks, indeed. You stupid tin boxes. "
2854,(The Ogron runs in.) 
2855,MASTER: Why aren't you guarding the prisoners? 
2856,OGRON 2: The Daleks sent me away! 
2857,MASTER: There are no Daleks! The Daleks have all left the planet! 
2858,OGRON 2: The Dalek said to open the cell. 
2859,MASTER: Did he now? Fetch the others! I want them here immediately!
2860,
2861,[The Master's Lair - passageway]
2862,
2863, (Jo shows the Doctor the shrine to BEM.) 
2864,"JO: Doctor, look at this. "
2865,"DOCTOR: Well, that's fascinating. "
2866,JO: Is it some sort of idol? I saw one of the Ogrons worshipping it. 
2867,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm not surprised. We've seen the real thing, haven't we."
2868,They're probably more frightened of him than they are of the Daleks. 
2869,"JO: Right, come on. This way."
2870,
2871, [The Master's Lair]
2872,
2873," JO: Right, you can get out this way. Good luck. "
2874,"WILLIAMS: And you, Miss Grant. Doctor. "
2875,DOCTOR: General Williams. 
2876,WILLIAMS: Farewell. 
2877,JO: Good luck. 
2878,DOCTOR: Your Royal Highness. 
2879,PRINCE: My life at your command. 
2880,(Williams and the Prince leave.) 
2881,JO: The Tardis is over there. 
2882,"MASTER: Going somewhere, Doctor? "
2883,"DOCTOR: You know, you really are incredibly persistent, aren't you? "
2884,"MASTER: That is my property, I believe. "
2885,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, yes, a most ingenious device. I congratulate you. "
2886,(The Doctor switches it on and the Ogrons panic.) 
2887,OGRONS: The monster! 
2888,"(The Master's gun is jolted as the Ogrons flee. It fires, grazing the"
2889,Doctor's skull and knocking him down. The Master is swept along with
2890,the Ogrons. Everyone wave farewell to Roger Delgado. Jo kneels by the
2891,"Doctor, who opens his eyes.) "
2892,"JO: Oh, Doctor, I thought you were dead. "
2893,DOCTOR: Help me up. 
2894,JO: Come on. That's it. Careful. 
2895,"DOCTOR: Help me into the Tardis, Jo. "
2896,JO: Okay.
2897,
2898, [Tardis]
2899,
2900," DOCTOR: All right, Jo. "
2901,JO: Careful. 
2902,DOCTOR: The first thing we've got to do is get out of here. 
2903,(The Tardis dematerialises. Then the Doctor puts his hands on two
2904,roundels on the console and concentrates.) 
2905,"JO: Doctor, what are you doing? "
2906,DOCTOR: Telepathic circuits. Sending a message to the Time Lords.
