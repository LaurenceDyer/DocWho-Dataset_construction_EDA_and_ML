20, [Street] 
21, (The Tardis has parked herself in a small
22,curtained-off alcove. The Doctor and Donna step out into the sunshine.
23,The streets are lined with vendors of various goods.) 
24,"DOCTOR: Ancient Rome. Well, not for them, obviously. To all intents and"
25,"purposes, right now, this is brand new Rome. "
26,"DONNA: Oh, my God. it's, it's so Roman. This is fantastic. "
27,"DOCTOR: Ha, ha. "
28,"DONNA: I'm here, in Rome. Donna Noble in Rome. This is just weird. I"
29,"mean, everyone here's dead. "
30,"DOCTOR: Well, don't tell them that. "
31,DONNA: Hold on a minute. That sign over there's in English. 
32,(Painted on the side of a barrow is two amphorae for the price of one.)
33,
34,DONNA: Are you having me on? Are we in Epcot? 
35,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. That's the Tardis translation circuits. Just"
36,makes it look like English. Speech as well. You're talking Latin right
37,now. 
38,DONNA: Seriously? 
39,DOCTOR: Mmm. 
40,DONNA: I just said seriously in Latin. 
41,"DOCTOR: Oh, yeah. "
42,"DONNA: What if I said something in actual Latin, like veni, vidi, vici?"
43,"My dad said that when he came back from football. If I said veni, vidi,"
44,"vici to that lot, what would it sound like? "
45,"DOCTOR: I'm not sure. You have to think of difficult questions, don't"
46,you? 
47,DONNA: I'm going to try it. 
48,(Donna goes to a fruit seller.) 
49,"STALLHOLDER: Afternoon, sweetheart. What can I get you, my love? "
50,"DONNA: Er, veni, vidi, vici. "
51,"STALLHOLDER: Huh? Sorry? Me no speak Celtic. No can do, missy. "
52,DONNA: Yeah. 
53,(She walks away.) 
54,"DONNA: How's he mean, Celtic? "
55,DOCTOR: Welsh. You sound Welsh. There we are. Learnt something. 
56,(A young woman with a white painted face and wearing a red cloak
57,watches them leave.) 
58,DONNA: Don't our clothes look a bit odd? 
59,"DOCTOR: Nah. Ancient Rome, anything goes. It's like Soho, but bigger. "
60,DONNA: You've been here before then? 
61,"DOCTOR: Mmm. Ages ago. Before you ask, that fire had nothing to do with"
62,"me. Well, a little bit. But I haven't got the chance to look around"
63,"properly. Coliseum, Pantheon, Circus Maximus. You'd expect them to be"
64,looming by now. Where is everything? Try this way. 
65,(The young woman follows them through the streets until they come out
66,into a piazza.) 
67,"DONNA: Not an expert, but there's seven hills of Rome, aren't there?"
68,How come they've only got one? 
69,"(One big, bare-headed mountain. Then the ground shakes.) "
70,MAN: Here we go again. 
71,(The vendors hang onto their stalls as pottery falls and breaks.) 
72,"DONNA: Wait a minute. One mountain, with smoke. Which makes this "
73,DOCTOR: Pompeii. We're in Pompeii. And it's volcano day.
74,
75,[Temple]
76,
77,"(The young woman runs inside, and joins a group of"
78,other young woman all dressed and painted in the same fashion. She
79,prostrates herself before the altar.) 
80,SOOTHSAYER: I beg audience with the High Priestess of the Sibylline. 
81,"(Yes, it is Karen Gillan.) "
82,"SPURRINA: : The High Priestess cannot be seen. What would you tell her,"
83,sister? 
84,"SOOTHSAYER: It has come, as foretold in the prophecy. The box. The blue"
85,box.
86,
87,[Street]
88,
89,"(The Doctor and Donna run back to the Tardis, but"
90,-) 
91,DONNA: You're kidding. You're not telling me the Tardis has gone. 
92,DOCTOR: Okay. 
93,DONNA: Where is it then? 
94,DOCTOR: You told me not to tell you. 
95,DONNA: Oi. Don't get clever in Latin. 
96,DOCTOR: Hold on. 
97,(He goes to the fruit seller.) 
98,DOCTOR: Excuse me. Excuse me. There was a box. Big blue box. Big blue
99,"wooden box, just over there. Where's it gone? "
100,"STALLHOLDER: Sold it, didn't I? "
101,DOCTOR: But it wasn't yours to sell. 
102,"STALLHOLDER: It was on my patch, weren't it? I got fifteen sesterces"
103,for it. Lovely jubbly. 
104,DOCTOR: Who'd you sell it to? 
105,"STALLHOLDER: Old Caecilius. Look, if you want to argue, why don't you"
106,take it out with him? He's on Foss Street. Big villa. Can't miss it. 
107,DOCTOR: Thanks. 
108,(The Doctor leaves and returns.) 
109,DOCTOR: What'd he buy a big blue wooden box for?
110,
111,[Villa]
112,
113,(Lucius Caecilius Iucundus is nouveau riche.) 
114,"CAECILIUS: Modern art. Out of the way, that's it. Oh, Rombus, I'm a"
115,"little bit peckish. Get me some ants in honey, there's a good lad. Ooo,"
116,maybe a dormouse? 
117,(The elderly slave leaves.) 
118,CAECILIUS: What do you think? 
119,(The lady in the blue robe is not impressed.) 
120,"METELLA: You call it modern art, I call it a blooming great waste of"
121,space. 
122,"CAECILIUS: We're going up in the world, my love. Lucius Dextrus himself"
123,is coming to the house this afternoon. What with that and with our
124,Evelina about to be elevated. 
125,"(The young lady of the house, Caecilia Evelina, enters.) "
126,"EVELINA: Oh, don't go on about it, Dad. "
127,METELLA: If we'd moved to Rome like I said she could've been a Vestal
128,virgin. 
129,"(Enter the son and heir, Quintus Caecilius Iucundus.) "
130,QUINTUS: Someone mention Vestal Virgins? 
131,"METELLA: Quintus, don't be so rude. You apologise to the Household"
132,Gods. 
133,QUINTUS: Get off. 
134,METELLA: Apologise right now. The Gods are always watching. 
135,(There is a ground tremor.) 
136,CAECILIUS: Positions! 
137,(Everyone runs to grab a precious artefact before it falls.) 
138,"METELLA: There, now you've made the heavens angry. Just say sorry. I"
139,"tell you, Caecilius, that boy will do no good. "
140,(Quintus goes to the shrine and sprinkles water on the carved plaque.) 
141,"QUINTUS: Sorry, Household Gods. "
142,"CAECILIUS: So where were you last night? Down the thelopolium, I bet,"
143,"cavorting with Etruscans and Christians and all sorts. How's your head,"
144,sunshine? How's your head! 
145,"QUINTUS: All right, Dad. Give us a break. "
146,"METELLA: You want to smarten yourself up, Quintus, before Lucius"
147,Dextrus gets here. Look at your sister. She's giving us status. 
148,"QUINTUS: Oh yeah, because it's all about Evelina. "
149,METELLA: She has the gift. 
150,(An eye tattooed on the back of her left hand.) 
151,METELLA: Be proud of your sister for once. Have you been consuming? 
152,EVELINA: Not this morning. 
153,"METELLA: Come on sweetheart, practise. It's hot today. The hypocaust is"
154,on full blast. 
155,(The women sit by a raised grill.) 
156,METELLA: The mountain God must be happy. Breathe deeply. Remember what
157,the sisterhood said. 
158,"EVELINA: Oh, it hurts. "
159,"METELLA: Oh, my love, is it too hot? "
160,EVELINA: Sometimes in the smoke I see the most terrible things. 
161,METELLA: Like what? 
162,EVELINA: A face. A face of stone. 
163,METELLA: It'll make sense one day. Sister Spurrina promised. The veil
164,will be parted and you'll be a seer. 
165,"(Evelina inhales the fumes, and sees a creature of rock with eyes and"
166,mouth of fire.) 
167,EVELINA: Who are you?
168,
169,[Street]
170,
171,(The Doctor runs into Donna.) 
172,DOCTOR: Ha. I've got it. Foss Street's this way. 
173,"DONNA: No. Well, I found this big sort of amphitheatre thing. We can"
174,start there. We can gather everyone together. Maybe they've got a great
175,big bell or something we could ring. Have they invented bells yet? 
176,DOCTOR: What do you want a bell for? 
177,DONNA: To warn everyone. Start the evacuation. What time does Vesuvius
178,erupt? When's it due? 
179,"DOCTOR: It's 79AD, twenty third of August, which makes volcano day"
180,tomorrow. 
181,DONNA: Plenty of time. We could get everyone out easy. 
182,"DOCTOR: Yeah, except we're not going to. "
183,DONNA: But that's what you do. You're the Doctor. You save people. 
184,DOCTOR: Not this time. Pompeii is a fixed point in history. What
185,"happens, happens. There is no stopping it. "
186,DONNA: Says who? 
187,DOCTOR: Says me. 
188,"DONNA: What, and you're in charge? "
189,"DOCTOR: Tardis, Time Lord, yeah. "
190,"DONNA: Donna, human, no. I don't need your permission. I'll tell them"
191,myself. 
192,"DOCTOR: You stand in the market place announcing the end of the world,"
193,"they'll just think you're a mad old soothsayer. Now, come on. Tardis."
194,We are getting out of here. 
195,"DONNA: Well, I might just have something to say about that, Spaceman. "
196,"DOCTOR: Oh, I bet you will. "
197,"(After they leave, the Soothsayer steps out and covers her face with"
198,"her palms, tattooed"
199,eyes over her own.) 
200,"SOOTHSAYER: The tall one, he calls us mad."
201,
202,[Temple]
203,
204,(Spurrina has also covered her eyes.) 
205,SPURRINA: Then he is a stranger to Pompeii. Soon he will learn. 
206,"THALINA: We have found it, Sister Spurrina, in the thirteenth book of"
207,the Sibylline
208,Oracles. The blue box. A temple made of wood. And yet the Sybil
209,"foretold that the box would appear at the time of storms, and fire, and"
210,betrayal. 
211,HIGH PRIESTESS : Sisters. 
212,(They go to a curtained area behind the altar.) 
213,"SPURRINA: Reverend Mother, you should sleep. "
214,HIGH PRIESTESS : The Sibylline Oracles are wrong. 
215,SPURRINA: But we have venerated her words for generations. 
216,HIGH PRIESTESS : This is a new age. Heed my words. I predict a
217,"future of prosperity and might. An endless empire of Pompeii, reaching"
218,"out from this city to topple Rome itself and encompass the whole, wide"
219,"world. If the Disciples of the Blue Box defy this prophecy, their blood"
220,will run across the temple floor. 
221,(The ground shakes.) 
222,SPURRINA: The gods approve.
223,
224,[Villa]
225,
226,CAECILIUS: Positions! 
227,(The Doctor catches the marble bust first.) 
228,DOCTOR: Whoa! There you go. 
229,"CAECILIUS: Thank you, kind sir. I'm afraid business is closed for the"
230,day. I'm expecting a visitor. 
231,"DOCTOR: But that's me, I'm a visitor. Hello. "
232,CAECILIUS: Who are you? 
233,DOCTOR: I am Spartacus. 
234,DONNA: And so am I. 
235,CAECILIUS: Mister and Mrs Spartacus. 
236,"DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no. We're not, we're not married. "
237,DONNA: We're not together. 
238,"CAECILIUS: Oh, then brother and sister? Yes, of course. You look very"
239,much alike. 
240,DOCTOR + DONNA: Really? 
241,"CAECILIUS: I'm sorry, but I'm not open for trade. "
242,DOCTOR: And that trade would be? 
243,"CAECILIUS: Marble. Lopus Caecilius. Mining, polishing and design"
244,"thereof. If you want marble, I'm your man. "
245,"DOCTOR: That's good. That's good, because I'm the marble inspector. "
246,(The Doctor flashes his psychic paper.) 
247,"METELLA: By the gods of commerce, an inspection. I'm sorry, sir. I do"
248,apologise for my son. 
249,(Metella pours away Quintus' goblet of wine.) 
250,QUINTUS: Oi. 
251,"CAECILIUS: And this is my good wife, Metella. I must confess, we're not"
252,prepared for a 
253,"DOCTOR: Nothing to worry about. I'm, I'm sure you've nothing to hide."
254,"Although, frankly, that object looks rather like wood to me. "
255,METELLA: I told you to get rid of it. 
256,CAECILIUS: I only bought it today. 
257,"DOCTOR: Ah, well. Caveat emptor. "
258,"CAECILIUS: Oh, you're Celtic. There's lovely. "
259,"DOCTOR: I'm sure it's fine, but I might have to take it off your hands"
260,for a proper inspection. 
261,"DONNA: Although while we're here, wouldn't you recommend a holiday,"
262,Spartacus? 
263,"DOCTOR: Don't know what you mean, Spartacus. "
264,"DONNA: Oh, this lovely family. Mother and father and son. Don't you"
265,think they should get out of town? 
266,CAECILIUS: Why should we do that? 
267,"DONNA: Well, the volcano, for starters. "
268,CAECILIUS: What? 
269,DONNA: Volcano. 
270,CAECILIUS: What ano? 
271,DONNA: That great big volcano right on your doorstep. 
272,"DOCTOR: Oh, Spartacus, for shame. We haven't even greeted the household"
273,gods yet. 
274,(He takes her aside to explain.) 
275,DOCTOR: They don't know what it is. Vesuvius is just a mountain to
276,them. The top hasn't blown off yet. The Romans haven't even got a word
277,for volcano. Not until tomorrow. 
278,"DONNA: Oh, great, they can learn a new word as they die. "
279,"DOCTOR: Donna, stop it. "
280,"DONNA: Listen, I don't know what sort of kids you've been flying round"
281,"with in outer space, but you're not telling me to shut up. That boy,"
282,"how old is he, sixteen? And tomorrow he burns to death. "
283,DOCTOR: And that's my fault? 
284,"DONNA: Right now, yes. "
285,"ROMBUS: Announcing Lucius Petrus Dextrus, Chief Augur of the City"
286,Government. 
287,(A middle aged man wearing a cloak over the right half of his body
288,enters.) 
289,"CAECILIUS: Lucius. My pleasure, as always. "
290,"METELLA: Quintus, stand up. "
291,"CAECILIUS: A rare and great honour, sir, for you to come to my house. "
292,"(Caecilius holds out his hand, but Lucius does not take it.) "
293,"LUCIUS: The birds are flying north, and the wind is in the west. "
294,"CAECILIUS: Quite. Absolutely. That's good, is it? "
295,LUCIUS: Only the grain of wheat knows where it will grow. 
296,"CAECILIUS: There now, Metella. Have you ever heard such wisdom? "
297,METELLA: Never. It's an honour. 
298,"CAECILIUS: Pardon me, sir. I have guests. This is Spartacus and, er,"
299,Spartacus. 
300,LUCIUS: A name is but a cloud upon a summer wind. 
301,DOCTOR: But the wind is felt most keenly in the dark. 
302,"LUCIUS: Ah. But what is the dark, other than an omen of the sun? "
303,DOCTOR: I concede that every sun must set. 
304,LUCIUS: Ha. 
305,DOCTOR: And yet the son of the father must also rise. 
306,"LUCIUS: Damn. Very clever, sir. Evidently, a man of learning. "
307,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. But don't mind me. Don't want to disturb the status"
308,quo. 
309,CAECILIUS: He's Celtic. 
310,DOCTOR: We'll be off in a minute. 
311,DONNA: I'm not going. 
312,"CAECILIUS: It's ready, sir. "
313,DOCTOR: You've got to. 
314,"DONNA: Well, I'm not. "
315,CAECILIUS: The moment of revelation. And here it is. 
316,"(As the Doctor takes Donna to the Tardis, he looks back to see a stone"
317,tile carved as a circuit board has just been unveiled.) 
318,"CAECILIUS: Exactly as you specified. It pleases you, sir? "
319,LUCIUS: As the rain pleases the soil. 
320,"DOCTOR: Oh, now that's different. Who designed that, then? "
321,CAECILIUS: My Lord Lucius was very specific. 
322,DOCTOR: Where'd you get the pattern? 
323,LUCIUS: On the rain and mist and wind. 
324,DONNA: But that looks like a circuit. 
325,DOCTOR: Made of stone. 
326,DONNA: Do you mean you just dreamt that thing up? 
327,"LUCIUS: That is my job, as City Augur. "
328,"DONNA: What's that, then, like the mayor? "
329,"DOCTOR: Oh, ha. You must excuse my friend, she's from Barcelona."
330,"(sotto) No, but this is an age of superstition. Of official"
331,superstition. The Augur is paid by the city to tell the future. The
332,wind will blow from the west? That's the equivalent of ten o'clock
333,news. 
334,"(Evelina enters the room, swaying and pale.) "
335,"EVELINA: They're laughing at us. Those two, they use words like"
336,tricksters. They're mocking us. 
337,"DOCTOR: No, no, I'm not. I meant no offence. "
338,METELLA: I'm sorry. My daughter's been consuming the vapours. 
339,"QUINTUS: Oh for gods, Mother. What have you been doing to her? "
340,"CAECILIUS: Not now, Quintus. "
341,"QUINTUS: Yeah, but she's sick. Just look at her. "
342,LUCIUS: I gather I have a rival in this household. Another with the
343,gift. 
344,"METELLA: Oh, she's been promised to the Sibylline Sisterhood. They say"
345,she has remarkable visions. 
346,LUCIUS: The prophecies of women are limited and dull. Only the menfolk
347,have the capacity for true perception. 
348,"DONNA: I'll tell you where the wind's blowing right now, mate. "
349,(A small tremor.) 
350,"LUCIUS: The Mountain God marks your words. I'd be careful, if I were"
351,you. 
352,"DOCTOR: Consuming the vapours, you say? "
353,EVELINA: They give me strength. 
354,DOCTOR: It doesn't look like it to me. 
355,EVELINA: Is that your opinion as a doctor? 
356,DOCTOR: I beg your pardon? 
357,EVELINA: Doctor. That's your name. 
358,DOCTOR: How did you know that? 
359,EVELINA: And you. You call yourself Noble. 
360,"METELLA: Now then, Evelina. Don't be rude. "
361,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. Let her talk. "
362,EVELINA: You both come from so far away. 
363,LUCIUS: The female soothsayer is inclined to invent all sorts of
364,vagaries. 
365,"DOCTOR: Oh, not this time, Lucius. No, I reckon you've been"
366,out-soothsayed. 
367,"LUCIUS: Is that so, man from Gallifrey? "
368,DOCTOR: What? 
369,"LUCIUS: The strangest of images. Your home is lost in fire, is it not? "
370,"DONNA: Doctor, what are they doing? "
371,"LUCIUS: And you, daughter of London. "
372,DONNA: How does he know that? 
373,LUCIUS: This is the gift of Pompeii. Every single oracle tells the
374,truth. 
375,DONNA: That's impossible. 
376,"LUCIUS: Doctor, she is returning. "
377,DOCTOR: Who is? Who's she? 
378,"LUCIUS: And you, daughter of London. There is something on your back. "
379,DONNA: What's that mean? 
380,EVELINA: Even the word Doctor is false. Your real name is hidden. It
381,"burns in the stars, in the Cascade of Medusa herself. You are a Lord,"
382,sir. A Lord of Time. 
383,(Evelina faints.) 
384,METELLA: Evelina!
385,
386,[Evelina's room]
387,
388,"(A cool, shady place.) "
389,METELLA: She didn't mean to be rude. She's ever such a good girl. But
390,when the gods speak through her. 
391,DONNA: What's wrong with her arm? 
392,"METELLA: An irritation of the skin. She never complains, bless her. We"
393,bathe it in olive oil every night. 
394,DONNA: What is it? 
395,"METELLA: Evelina said you'd come from far away. Please, have you ever"
396,seen anything like it? 
397,(Donna strokes the dark rash on Evelina's forearm.) 
398,DONNA: It's stone.
399,
400,[Villa]
401,
402,(The Doctor removes the hypocaust grill.) 
403,DOCTOR: Different sort of hypocaust? 
404,"CAECILIUS: Oh, yes. We're very advanced in Pompeii. In Rome, they're"
405,"still using the old wood-burning furnaces, but we've got hot springs,"
406,leading from Vesuvius itself. 
407,DOCTOR: Who thought of that? 
408,"CAECILIUS: The soothsayers, after the great earthquake, seventeen years"
409,ago. An awful lot of damage. But we rebuilt. 
410,"DOCTOR: Didn't you think of moving away? Oh no, then again, San"
411,Francisco. 
412,"CAECILIUS: That's a new restaurant in Naples, isn't it? "
413,DOCTOR: What's that noise? 
414,CAECILIUS: Don't know. Happens all the time. They say the gods of the
415,Underworld are stirring. 
416,"DOCTOR: But after the earthquake, let me guess. Is that when the"
417,soothsayers started making sense? 
418,"CAECILIUS: Oh, yes, very much so. I mean, they'd always been, shall we"
419,"say, imprecise? But then the soothsayers, the augurs, the haruspex, all"
420,"of them, they saw the truth again and again. It's quite amazing. They"
421,can predict crops and rainfall with absolute precision. 
422,DOCTOR: Haven't they said anything about tomorrow? 
423,"CAECILIUS: No. Why, should they? Why do you ask? "
424,"DOCTOR: No, no. No reason. I'm just asking. But the soothsayers, they"
425,"all consume the vapours, yeah? "
426,CAECILIUS: That's how they see. 
427,DOCTOR: Ipso facto. 
428,CAECILIUS: Look you. 
429,DOCTOR: They're all consuming this. 
430,CAECILIUS: Dust. 
431,DOCTOR: Tiny particles of rock. They're breathing in Vesuvius. 
432,"(The Doctor goes to where Quintus is reclining on a couch, drinking.) "
433,"DOCTOR: Quintus, me old son. This Lucius Petrus Dextrus. Where does he"
434,live? 
435,QUINTUS: It's nothing to do with me. 
436,DOCTOR: Let me try again. This Lucius Petrus Dextrus. 
437,(The Doctor produces a coin from behind Quintus' ear.) 
438,DOCTOR: Where does he live?

453,QUINTUS: The liar. He told my father it was the only one. 
454,"DOCTOR: Well, plenty of marble merchants in this town. Tell them all"
455,"the same thing, get all the components from different places, so no one"
456,can see what you're building.

465,DONNA: You're not supposed to laugh. Thanks for that. What do you
466,think? The Goddess Venus. 
467,"EVELINA: Oh, that's sacrilege. "
468,"DONNA: Nice to see you laugh, though. What do you do in old Pompeii,"
469,"then, girls your age? You got mates? Do you go hanging about round the"
470,shops? TK Maximus? 
471,EVELINA: I am promised to the Sisterhood for the rest of my life. 
472,DONNA: Do you get any choice in that? 
473,EVELINA: It's not my decision. The Sisters chose for me. I have the
474,gift of sight. 
475,DONNA: Then what can you see happening tomorrow? 
476,EVELINA: Is tomorrow special? 
477,DONNA: You tell me. What do you see? 
478,"EVELINA: The sun will rise, the sun will set. Nothing special at all. "

492,"DONNA: But everything I'm about to say to you is true, I swear. Just"
493,"listen to me. Tomorrow, that mountain is"
494,"going to explode. Evelina, please listen. The air is going to fill with"
495,"ash and rocks, tons and tons of it, and this whole town is"

509,EVELINA: This is false prophecy.

525,"DOCTOR: What, the soothsayer doesn't know? "
526,LUCIUS: The seed may float on the breeze in any direction. 
527,"DOCTOR: Yeah, I knew you were going to say that. But it's an energy"
528,converter. 
529,LUCIUS: An energy converter of what? 
530,DOCTOR: I don't know. Isn't that brilliant? I love not knowing. Keeps
531,"me on my toes. It must be awful being a prophet, waking up every"
532,"morning, is it raining? Yes, it is, I said so. Takes all the fun out of"
533,"life. But who designed this, Lucius, hmm? Who gave you these"
534,instructions?

536,"DOCTOR: Lucius, really, tell me. Honestly, I'm on your side. I can"

579,(Rumble. A dog starts barking.)

581,(Rumble.)

613,"(Quintus and a slave return with buckets, scoop water from the fish"
614,"pond and throw it on the creature. Its fire goes out, it solidifies"
615,then cracks and crumbles to the floor.) 
616,CAECILIUS: What was it? 
617,"DOCTOR: Carapace of stone, held together by internal magma. Not too"
618,"difficult to stop, but I reckon that's just the foot soldier. "
619,"METELLA: Doctor, or whatever your name is, you bring bad luck on this"

621,DOCTOR: I thought your son was brilliant. Aren't you going to thank

633,SPURRINA: You will be silent. 
634,"DONNA: Listen, sister, you might have eyes on the back of your hands,"
635,but you'll have eyes in the back of your head by the time I've finished
636,with you. Let me go!

638,"(Promises, promises. Spurrina raises the blade.) "
639,"DOCTOR: Oh, that'll be the day. "
640,SPURRINA: No man is allowed to enter the Temple of Sibyl. 
641,"DOCTOR: Well, that's all right. Just us girls. Do you know, I met the"
642,"Sibyl once. Yeah, hell of a woman. Blimey, she could dance the"
643,"Tarantella. Nice teeth. Truth be told, I think she had a bit of a thing"

651,SPURRINA: What magic is this? 
652,"DOCTOR: Let me tell you about the Sibyl, the founder of this religion."

654,"that how you spread the word, hey? On the blade of a knife? "
655,"SPURRINA: Yes, a knife that now welcomes you. "

659,starlight in his wake. 
660,"DOCTOR: Oh, very perceptive. Where do these words of wisdom come from? "
661,HIGH PRIESTESS : The gods whisper to me. 
662,DOCTOR: They've done far more than that. Might I beg audience? Look
663,upon the High Priestess?

671,HIGH PRIESTESS: It is necessary.

673,HIGH PRIESTESS: The voices.

675,to happen to all of you? 
676,(Spurrina shows Donna her stone forearm.) 
677,SPURRINA: The blessings are manifold. 
678,DONNA: They're stone. 
679,DOCTOR: Exactly. The people of Pompeii are turning to stone before the
680,volcano erupts. But why? 
681,"HIGH PRIESTESS: This word, this image in your mind. This volcano. What"
682,is that? 
683,"DOCTOR: More to the point, why don't you know about it? Who are you? "
684,HIGH PRIESTESS: High Priestess of the Sibylline. 
685,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. I'm talking to the creature inside you. The"
686,"thing that's seeding itself into a human body, in the dust, in the"
687,"lungs, taking over the flesh and turning it into, what? "
688,HIGH PRIESTESS: Your knowledge is impossible. 
689,"DOCTOR: Oh, but you can read my mind. You know it's not. I demand you"
690,tell me who you are. 
691,"(The High Priestess speaks with two voices, her own and one deeper,"
692,which takes over.)

695,"SISTERS: Words of wisdom, words of power. Words of wisdom, words of"

706,stage. 
707,"DONNA: What, and that turns into? "
708,DOCTOR: That thing in the villa. That was an adult Pyrovile. 
709,"HIGH PRIESTESS: And the breath of a Pyrovile will incinerate you,"
710,Doctor. 
711,(The Doctor produces a yellow plastic water pistol.) 
712,"DOCTOR: I warn you, I'm armed. Donna, get that grill open. "
713,DONNA: What for? 
714,DOCTOR: Just. What are the Pyrovile doing here? 
715,"HIGH PRIESTESS: We fell from the heavens. We fell so far and so fast,"
716,we were rendered into dust. 
717,"DOCTOR: Right, creatures of stone shattered on impact. When was that,"
718,seventeen years ago? 
719,HIGH PRIESTESS: We have slept beneath for thousands of years. 
720,"DOCTOR: Okay, so seventeen years ago woke you up, and now you're using"
721,human bodies to reconstitute yourselves. But why the psychic powers?
722,HIGH PRIESTESS: We opened their minds and found such gifts. 
723,"DOCTOR: Okay, that's fine. So you force yourself inside a human brain,"
724,"use the latent psychic talent to bond. I get that, I get that, yeah."
725,But seeing the future? That is way beyond psychic. You can see through
726,time. Where does the gift of prophecy come from? 
727,DONNA: Got it. 
728,DOCTOR: Now get down. 
729,"DONNA: What, down there? "
730,"DOCTOR: Yes, down there. Why can't this lot predict a volcano? Why is"
731,it being hidden? 
732,"SPURRINA: Sisters, I see into his mind. The weapon is harmless. "
733,"DOCTOR: Yeah, but it's got to sting. "
734,"(He squirts the water at the High Priestess. Yes, it does hurt her.) "
735,DOCTOR: Get down there!

777,DONNA: But I'm history to you. You saved me in 2008. You saved us all.
778,Why is that different? 
779,"DOCTOR: Some things are fixed, some things are in flux. Pompeii is"
780,fixed. 
781,DONNA: How do you know which is which? 
782,"DOCTOR: Because that's how I see the universe. Every waking second, I"
783,"can see what is, what was, what could be, what must not. That's the"
784,"burden of a Time Lord, Donna. And I'm the only one left. "
785,DONNA: How many people died? 
786,DOCTOR: Stop it. 
787,"DONNA: Doctor, how many people died? "
788,DOCTOR: Twenty thousand.

808,DOCTOR: What's that thing? 
809,(He uses a monocular to look at some distant construct.) 
810,"DONNA: Oh, you better hurry up and think of something. Rocky fall's on"

812,DOCTOR: That's how they arrived. Or what's left of it. Escape pod?
813,Prison ship? Gene bank? 
814,"DONNA: But why do they need a volcano? Maybe it erupts, and they launch"
815,themselves back into space or something?

817,"DONNA: How could it be worse? Doctor, it's getting closer. "

825,"(A Pyrovile rears up in front of them, so the Doctor extinguishes it"
826,with his water pistol. They run to the escape pod.) 
827,"LUCIUS: There is nowhere to run, Doctor, and daughter of London. "
828,"DOCTOR: Now then, Lucius. My lords Pyrovillian, don't get yourselves in"
829,a lather. In a lava? No? No. But if I might beg the wisdom of the gods
830,"before we perish. Once this new race of creatures is complete, then"
831,what? 
832,LUCIUS: My masters will follow the example of Rome itself. An almighty
833,"empire, bestriding the whole of civilisation. "
834,"DONNA: But if you've crashed, and you've got all this technology, why"
835,don't you just go home? 
836,LUCIUS: The Heaven of Pyrovillia is gone. 
837,"DOCTOR: What do you mean, gone? Where's it gone? "
838,LUCIUS: It was taken. Pyrovillia is lost. But there is heat enough in
839,this world for a new species to rise. 
840,"DOCTOR: Yeah, I should warn you, it's seventy percent water out there. "
841,"LUCIUS: Water can boil. And everything will burn, Doctor. "
842,DOCTOR: Then the whole planet is at stake. Thank you. That's all I
843,needed to know. Donna.

849,DONNA: Could we be any more trapped? 
850,(The Pyroviles breathe fire at the escape pod.) 
851,DONNA: Little bit hot. 
852,"DOCTOR: See? The energy converter takes the lava, uses the power to"
853,"create a fusion matrix, which welds Pyrovile to human. Now it's"
854,"complete, they can convert millions. "
855,DONNA: But can't you change it with these controls? 
856,"DOCTOR: Of course I can, but don't you see? That's why the soothsayers"
857,can't see the volcano. There is no volcano. Vesuvius is never
858,going to erupt. The Pyrovile are stealing all its power. They're going
859,to use it to take over the world. 
860,DONNA: But you can change it back? 
861,"DOCTOR: I can invert the system, set off the volcano, and blow them up,"
862,"yes. But, that's the choice, Donna. It's Pompeii or the world. "
863,"DONNA: Oh, my God. "
864,"DOCTOR: If Pompeii is destroyed then it's not just history, it's me. I"
865,make it happen. 
866,"DONNA: Doctor, the Pyrovile are made of rocks. Maybe they can't be"
867,blown up.

957,"DONNA: What about you, Evelina? Can you see anything? "
958,EVELINA: The visions have gone. 
959,"DOCTOR: The explosion was so powerful it cracked open a rift in time,"

963,temple containing such size within?
