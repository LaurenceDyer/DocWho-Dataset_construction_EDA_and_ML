22, [Culloden moor] 
23,"(1746. Scottish Highland clans, loyal to Bonnie"
24,"Prince Charles Edward, battle with the English and German regiments"
25,"loyal to the English monarch, King George. Finally overpowered by"
26,"superior forces, the Highlanders break ranks and leave the battlefield."
27,"The leader of Clan McLaren, Colin, is badly injured. His son Alexander,"
28,"daughter Kirsty and a young piper called Jamie McCrimmon, accompany"
29,"him. Confronted on the path by two Redcoats, Alexander engages the"
30,"soldiers in a sword fight. He kills one Redcoat and the other flees,"
31,allowing the small group to move on seeking refuge. The Tardis
32,"materialises in small hollow, concealed from view by bushes and"
33,"brambles. Ben comes out, followed by Polly and the Doctor.) "
34,POLLY: It's so cool. 
35,"BEN: Hey, Polly. "
36,POLLY: What? 
37,BEN: Where does this remind you of? 
38,"POLLY: Oh, it's cold and damp. "
39,"BEN: No, where does it remind you of? "
40,POLLY: Ouch! Prickles! What? 
41,"BEN: Where else could it be? We're home, Duchess! "
42,"POLLY: Oh, you never give up hope, do you? We'll ask the Doctor. Hey,"
43,Doctor. 
44,DOCTOR: Listen. 
45,(There's an explosion in the distance.) 
46,BEN: It sounds like the cup final. 
47,"(Something whistles towards them, fast.) "
48,POLLY: Look out! 
49,(Ben and Polly throw themselves to the ground as the something goes
50,"Boom nearby. The Doctor hides in the brambles, hands over his head.) "
51,DOCTOR: What are you doing down there? 
52,BEN: What was it? It looks like an old-time cannon ball. Ow! It's hot. 
53,"DOCTOR: Allow me. Yes, a ten pounder. That does it. "
54,"POLLY: But Doctor, we can't leave. This looks like England. "
55,"BEN: Yeah, I'm going to look over that hill. "
56,"POLLY: Doctor, you don't want us to think you're afraid, do you? "
57,DOCTOR: Why not? 
58,"POLLY: Look, we can't let Ben go up there on his own. We don't know"
59,what he's going to find. Come on. 
60,[Cottage] 
61,"(In a ruined cottage, Kirsty is tending her"
62,father's wounds.) 
63,"COLIN: Ahh, Kirsty. Ahh. "
64,KIRSTY: He badly needs a doctor.
65,(Everyone say Hi to Hannah
66,Gordon.) 
67,"ALEXANDER: Aye, and food. "
68,COLIN: Water. Water. 
69,"KIRSTY: Whist, father. "
70,ALEXANDER: Water. Water. 
71,JAMIE: There's a wee drop left yet. 
72,(Everyone say Hi! to handsome young Fraser Hines as the
73,McLaren drinks from the canteen
74,and Jamie looks at the remaining piece of his bagpipes - the chanter.) 
75,COLIN: The battle. The battle! 
76,"ALEXANDER: It's done. The clans are broken, shot to pieces by the"
77,English guns. Never had the chance to get to within claymore's length
78,of them. 
79,"COLIN: Ah, the slaughter. "
80,(Jamie starts to play.) 
81,ALEXANDER: Whist! Do you want to bring the redcoats upon us? 
82,"JAMIE: They'll be here soon enough, have no fear. "
83,COLIN: The Prince? 
84,JAMIE: Dinna fash yourself. He was the first to leave the field. 
85,ALEXANDER: What's that you say about the Prince? 
86,"COLIN: Ah stay, the pair of you. Why didn't you leave me to die on the"
87,field? 
88,ALEXANDER: You're the Laird himself. 
89,COLIN: The Laird of what? All the men of our clan are lying in the mud
90,"of the Culloden Moor. Oh, I should be with them. Oh, Kirsty, my Kirsty."
91,
92,ALEXANDER: We may not be long joining them. The English troops are
93,butchering all their wounded and hanging all their prisoners. 
94,"JAMIE: They canna hang us all, can they? "
95,"ALEXANDER: They'll never hang me, piper. You may be sure of that. "
96,(Alexander sees movement outside) 
97,ALEXANDER: Whist! 
98,KIRSTY: The English? 
99,ALEXANDER: There is but three of them. 
100,JAMIE: They're not soldiers. 
101,COLIN: Our people? 
102,"ALEXANDER: Well, I'll find out. Jamie, at the rear. You gang that way."
103,Wait my signal.
104,
105,[Near the cottage]
106,
107,(Jamie and Alexander set off in opposite directions
108,to circle round. Ben spots an abandoned field gun.) 
109,"BEN: Hey, look! This must be where that cannon ball came from. "
110,DOCTOR: It's unlikely. 
111,BEN: What do you mean it's unlikely? 
112,DOCTOR: It's been spiked. 
113,BEN: Been what? 
114,DOCTOR: It's been spiked. 
115,(A long spike has been hammered down the barrel.) 
116,"BEN: Well, how did you know? "
117,(The Doctor has spotted a bonnet with eagle feather and Jacobite
118,cockade.) 
119,DOCTOR: I would like a hat like this. How do I look? 
120,POLLY: It's got words on it. With Charles our brave and merciful Prince
121,"Royal, we'll greatly fall or nobly save our country. "
122,DOCTOR: Bah. Romantic piffle. 
123,(The Doctor throws the bonnet to the ground.) 
124,ALEXANDER: You'll pick it up. 
125,(His claymore is at the Doctor's throat.) 
126,"JAMIE: Careful, like. "
127,(Jamie has his dirk at Ben's chest. The Doctor picks up the bonnet.) 
128,ALEXANDER: This way with you. Quick! 
129,(The battle draws closer.)
130,
131,[Cottage]
132,
133,COLIN: We're going to awa' to the caves. 
134,"KIRSTY: Father, you're in no fit state to travel. "
135,ALEXANDER: Kirsty! Get away with you. 
136,COLIN: Who are they? 
137,ALEXANDER: I know not. They're no Scot. They threw down the Prince's
138,cockade. 
139,POLLY: Cockade? 
140,BEN: What Prince? 
141,DOCTOR: Prince Charles Edward. Bonnie Prince Charlie. 
142,"ALEXANDER: You have the tongue. Aye, I thought so. English, the three"
143,"of them. Camp followers to the Duke of Cumberland, come to steal from"
144,the dead. 
145,COLIN: Abide a moment! Do you wish to pray before you die? 
146,DOCTOR: Die? 
147,POLLY: Die for what? 
148,"BEN: Well, you can't kill us in cold blood. "
149,"JAMIE: Well, our bloods warm enough! Your English troopers gave no"
150,"quarter to men, women and bairns. "
151,"POLLY: Doctor, tell them who we are. "
152,KIRSTY: Doctor? 
153,"ALEXANDER: Get away with you, woman. "
154,KIRSTY: We have need of a doctor. 
155,ALEXANDER: The Laird. 
156,COLIN: Get me a doctor. Get me a doctor. 
157,"KIRSTY: Look, kill them after. Let them help the Laird first. "
158,"ALEXANDER: We're not going to trust the Laird with these sassenachs,"
159,woman. 
160,(Ben dives forward and snatches a pistol from Colin's side.) 
161,KIRSTY: But if they can help him at all 
162,"ALEXANDER: Kirsty, get away, will you. "
163,DOCTOR: Just think of the women. 
164,"BEN: Right, back both of you! Or your Laird won't need a doctor. "
165,"DOCTOR: Well done, Ben. And now, gentlemen. "
166,ALEXANDER: I'm warning you! 
167,"DOCTOR: Your swords, I think. Ben, cock the pistol. "
168,KIRSTY: But why? Give them up! 
169,"DOCTOR: Polly, take the swords. That's the style. Now, back against the"
170,"wall, both of you. Go on! That's better. Now, I'm going to have a look"
171,"at the wound. Come along, come along, let me see. Yes. We're going to"
172,need some clean water to bathe the wound. Ah. 
173,(The Doctor picks up a bucket and gives it to Kirsty.) 
174,KIRSTY: I'll not leave him. 
175,DOCTOR: We're not going to harm him. Polly? 
176,POLLY: Yes. 
177,DOCTOR: You go with her. 
178,POLLY: All right. 
179,DOCTOR: Off you go then. 
180,POLLY: Will you show me where the stream is? 
181,"ALEXANDER: Here, Kirsty. Take the Laird's spyglass with you and watch"
182,out for these Sassenach dragoons. 
183,(Polly and Kirsty leave.) 
184,"DOCTOR: You can put that away now, Ben. "
185,BEN: Put it away? But 
186,DOCTOR: Will you both give us your word that you'll not molest us?
187,We're only trying to save your Laird from bleeding to death. 
188,ALEXANDER: Aye. 
189,JAMIE: You have our word. 
190,"DOCTOR: Put it away, Ben. "
191,"BEN: What, are you going to trust these blokes? "
192,DOCTOR: A Highlanders word is his bond. At least don't point it at me! 
193,(Ben tosses the pistol onto the table. Bang!) 
194,BEN: It just went off. 
195,ALEXANDER: You fool! 
196,JAMIE: You'll have every English soldier within miles! 
197,"BEN: Well, what's wrong with that? "
198,DOCTOR: What's? You should have paid more attention to your history
199,"books, Ben. "
200,BEN: Ay? 
201,JAMIE: Redcoats! There's about six of them. 
202,ALEXANDER: They'll slaughter us.
203,
204,[Culloden moor]
205,
206,"(An elegant officer, Algernon Ffinch, gazes down at"
207,the cottage.) 
208,"SERGEANT: Sir! A rebel's been sighted, sir, at the door the cottage"
209,where the shooting seemed to come from. 
210,FFINCH: Good. Only one? 
211,"SERGEANT: Only one seen, sire. There could be more. "
212,"FFINCH: There better be. We haven't seen many, have we? "
213,"SERGEANT: No, well, the troopers were ahead of us, sir. "
214,"FFINCH: And done a good job. Now, I wish they'd left us some pickings. "
215,"SERGEANT: Ah, perhaps when they got away they took their possessions"
216,with them. 
217,"FFINCH: Let's hope so. Take a man around the rear, Sergeant. We'll"
218,out-flank them. 
219,SERGEANT: Sir! 
220,FFINCH: Tell them to shoot first and take no risks. Remember these
221,rebels will be desperate by now. 
222,"SERGEANT: Yes, sir! "
223,FFINCH: Advance in battle order. 
224,(His soldiers fix bayonets and advance.)
225,
226, [Cottage]
227,
228,JAMIE: We'll be caught like rats in a trap. Can we
229,not run for it? 
230,ALEXANDER: And leave the Laird to their mercy? There is but one chance.
231,It is but a very slim one. I will try and draw them away from this
232,cottage. 
233,DOCTOR: Wait! Wait! 
234,(Alexander runs out to face the Redcoats.)
235,
236,[Culloden moor]
237,
238,ALEXANDER: Creag an tuire! 
239,(He is shot repeatedly.) 
240,[Cottage]
241,
242,SERGEANT: Surrender in the King's name! 
243,"BEN: Blimey, it's good to hear a London voice again. "
244,"SERGEANT: Silence, you rebel dog. "
245,BEN: Rebel? What are you talking about? I'm no rebel! Me and the Doctor
246,"here, have just arrived. "
247,"SERGEANT: Deserter, then. You'll hang just the same. "
248,"DOCTOR: (German accent) I'm glad you've come, Sergeant. I was waiting"
249,for an escort. 
250,SERGEANT: Who the devil do 
251,"DOCTOR: Civil tongue, Sergeant! You are in charge of these men? "
252,"FFINCH: No, I am. "
253,"DOCTOR: A gentleman at last. Doctor von Wer, at your service. "
254,SERGEANT: Doctor who? 
255,DOCTOR: (sotto) That's what I said. 
256,FFINCH: One of those confounded froggies that came over with the
257,Pretender. 
258,BEN: We ain't French. Are we? 
259,"DOCTOR: German, from Hanover. Where your good King George comes from."
260,And I speak English a good deal better than he does. 
261,"SERGEANT: Hear that, sir. Treason! Shall we hang them now? "
262,FFINCH: Wait a moment. Who is that? 
263,"JAMIE: Colin McLaren, the Laird, and I'm his piper. "
264,"SERGEANT: Ah, they're a poor lot, sir. We'll get no pickings here."
265,Let's hang them and have done. 
266,"BEN: Well, a right shower you are! What have we done? Nothing! And what"
267,"have you got against these two? They lost a battle, right? Well,"
268,doesn't that make them prisoners of war? 
269,"FFINCH: Rebels are not treated as prisoners of war. Right, Sergeant,"
270,prepare to hang them. 
271,SERGEANT: Sir. Take him out. 
272,DOCTOR: Didn't I tell you I was 
273,SERGEANT: And you. 
274,BEN: But we haven't done anything! 
275,SERGEANT: And you. 
276,JAMIE: But he can't walk! 
277,SERGEANT: Drag him!
278,
279, [Duke of Cumberland's line]
280,
281,"(On a supply wagon, an English solicitor called"
282,"Grey has been watching the battle through a telescope. His secretary,"
283,"Perkins, is setting up luncheon.) "
284,GREY: Perkins. Perkins! 
285,"PERKINS: Yes, sir. "
286,"GREY: Not a very inspiring battle, would you say, Perkins? "
287,"PERKINS: Don't really know, sir. I've never seen one before. "
288,GREY: This one was over in a brief hour. Never have I seen such brave
289,"fellows so poorly led. And now, Cumberland's troops are butchering the"
290,"wounded. It's such a waste of manpower. A little wine, Perkins? "
291,"PERKINS: Oh, yes, sir. Quite ready for it, I am, sir. This sharp"
292,"northern air, sir, gives one quite an appetite. "
293,(Two soldiers appear with a Scottish prisoner. The wounded Highlander
294,looks longingly at the food as he is dragged past.) 
295,"GREY: Ah, all these fine sturdy Highlanders. Used to hard work and"
296,"little food. Think what a price they'd fetch in Jamaica or Barbados,"
297,Perkins. 
298,"PERKINS: A pretty penny, no doubt, sir. No doubt at all. "
299,"GREY: Indeed, and I'll have them, Perkins. I did not give up a thriving"
300,"legal practise, just for the honour of serving King George as his"
301,Commissioner of Prisons. 
302,"PERKINS: I thought there was more behind it, sir. "
303,"GREY: With Mister Trask and his ship at our service, we may expect to"
304,"clear some measure of profit out of this rebellion, ay Perkins? "
305,"PERKINS: Yes, sir. "
306,"GREY: Depending, of course, on how many of the wretched rebels we can"
307,deliver from his Majesty's over zealous soldiers. 
308,"(Grey tastes his wine and spits it out in disgust, throwing the rest"
309,into Perkins' face.) 
310,"GREY: The wine was corked. If you wish to remain in my service, you'll"
311,"have to be more careful, won't you, Perkins? "
312,"PERKINS: Yes, sir. My apologies, sir. It won't happen again, sir. "
313,"GREY: I think we best be about our business, otherwise there'll be"
314,nothing but corpses left on the battlefield. And corpses are of little
315,"use to us, ay Perkins? "
316,"PERKINS: Yes, sir. Wagon, sir? "
317,"GREY: No, I think not. I've had enough for one day. Come, Perkins,"
318,we'll walk. 
319,"PERKINS: Yes, sir. "
320,"(Grey strides off, leaving Perkins to cope with the hamper.) "
321,GREY: Perkins. 
322,"PERKINS: Yes, sir? "
323,(Perkins takes a mouthful of wine.) 
324,GREY: Perkins!
325,
326,[Culloden moor]
327,
328,(Polly and Kirsty are returning to the cottage with
329,the water. At the top of the hill they spot the soldiers outside the
330,cottage.) 
331,KIRSTY: Down! 
332,"POLLY: Oh, you've spilt the water. Who are those men? "
333,KIRSTY: Don't pretend you can't recognise English Redcoats when you see
334,"them, even at this distance. "
335,"POLLY: English? Well, that's all right, then. We're safe. "
336,"KIRSTY: Do you want to get us both killed? Tortured? Look, they're"
337,going to hang our men. 
338,(Polly takes the telescope to see nooses being hung over the branch of
339,an oak tree.) 
340,POLLY: You're right. It's horrible. They've got to be stopped. 
341,KIRSTY: How? 
342,"POLLY: Well, there must be something we can do? "
343,KIRSTY: We can but mourn. 
344,POLLY: Crying's no good. Have you still got breath to run. Come on.
345,We're going to create a diversion. 
346,(Polly throws a stone in the direction of the cottage.) 
347,[Outside the cottage]
348,
349,FFINCH: What was that? 
350,(A second stone hits a soldier.) 
351,"SERGEANT: Look, sir, over there, on that hill. "
352,"FFINCH: Looks like a wench. Stab me, there's another one. "
353,"SERGEANT: Yeah, puts me in mind of what Sergeant King of the Dragoons"
354,"said, sir. "
355,FFINCH: What? 
356,"SERGEANT: Well, the Dragoons have got orders to stop every woman. Not"
357,"that they need them, mind. "
358,"FFINCH: Get to the point, Sergeant. "
359,"SERGEANT: Well, they've heard that the Prince is trying to escape"
360,"disguised as a woman. Shall I go after them, sir? "
361,"FFINCH: No, I'll go. You two men, come with me. "
362,"SERGEANT: Yeah, but I "
363,[Culloden moor]
364,
365,POLLY: This is our chance. The officer's coming
366,after us. They can't hang them with the officer away. Let's go. 
367,KIRSTY: It'll do no good. 
368,"POLLY: Besides which, you must know this place better than they do. "
369,KIRSTY: There's a high track. 
370,POLLY: And we're younger than they are. They'll never catch us. Come
371,on. 
372,"KIRSTY: But, look "
373,POLLY: Leave that. 
374,(Kirsty leaves the bucket. After a short while Polly has to abandon her
375,shoes and go barefoot to keep up with Kirsty. The soldiers start to
376,fall behind.)
377,
378,[Outside the Cottage]
379,
380,"(The Doctor, Ben, Jamie and Colin all have nooses"
381,around their necks.) 
382,"DOCTOR: What a great devotion to duty your Lieutenant shows, Sergeant. "
383,"SERGEANT: Devotion to duty. Devotion to thirty thousand pound reward,"
384,that's all. 
385,DOCTOR: You think he will catch them? 
386,SERGEANT: That young whelp? Couldn't catch his own grandmother. 
387,"DOCTOR: Disrespect to your superior officer, Sergeant? I could report"
388,you. 
389,"SERGEANT: You could, but you won't. "
390,"DOCTOR: Ah, but at a price, Sergeant. "
391,"SERGEANT: You won't, cause you won't be here when he gets back. All"
392,"right you scum, proceed with the hanging. "
393,"BEN: Well, you can't hang us with the officer away. "
394,"SERGEANT: Why do you think he went away? Got a delicate stomach, he"
395,has. Always leaves the dirty stuff to me. Right! Get them up! 
396,(The prisoners are forced to stand on a bench.) 
397,SERGEANT: Take the strain! Stand by! 
398,(A drum roll starts.) 
399,GREY: Halt! 
400,SERGEANT: What do you want? 
401,GREY: One moment! 
402,SERGEANT: Who the devil are you? 
403,GREY: Perkins. 
404,"PERKINS: Solicitor Grey, Lincolns Inn Fields. His Majesty's"
405,Commissioner for the disposal of rebel prisoners. 
406,GREY: There's a fine sturdy young man. Take the nooses off them. Set
407,that young man down. 
408,PERKINS: Set him down. 
409,SERGEANT: I don't care who you are. You've got no charge over my men. 
410,"GREY: Can you not read, Sergeant? I have charge over all rebel"
411,prisoners. 
412,PERKINS: Of course he has. Appointed by the Chief Justice of England.
413,All prisoners. 
414,SERGEANT: Not these. 
415,GREY: Perkins. 
416,(Perkins searches in his pocket.) 
417,"GREY: The other pocket, I think. "
418,(Perkins produces some silver coins.) 
419,"GREY: I admit your prior claim, Sergeant, but I think you are a"
420,reasonable man. 
421,(The payment is refused.) 
422,"GREY: Continue, Perkins. Continue, I said. Of course, I regret any"
423,inconvenience encountered by yourself and these fine fellows of yours. 
424,"SERGEANT: All right, you heard what the Commissioner said. Nooses off."
425,Get him down. 
426,"BEN: Oh, thanks, sir. "
427,"GREY: A trifle, I assure you. Strong ruffians like you and this other"
428,"young rebel here, are needed in his Majesty's service. "
429,"DOCTOR: Ah, yes. "
430,(Grey gestures to the Doctor and Colin.) 
431,"GREY: You can despatch this one, Sergeant, and this strange looking"
432,scoundrel. 
433,"DOCTOR: Article Seventeen, Aliens Act, 1730. "
434,GREY: What? 
435,DOCTOR: You are gentlemen of the law? 
436,PERKINS: How dare you speak to Mister Grey like that. 
437,"GREY: I am a lawyer, yes. "
438,DOCTOR: Then you are doubtless familiar with Article Seventeen. You
439,"cannot hang a citizen of a foreign power, without first informing his"
440,ambassador. 
441,"PERKINS: Article Seventeen, Aliens Act? "
442,GREY: Who is this extraordinary rogue? 
443,"SERGEANT: He says he's a frog doctor, sir. "
444,"DOCTOR: German. And I know more about the English law than you do, it"
445,seems. 
446,"SERGEANT: I'm the only law what matters to you right now, matey. And if"
447,"this gentleman don't want you, you hang. "
448,"GREY: No, wait. You show a touching faith in his Majesty's justice,"
449,"sir. A doctor, eh? We need doctors where you're going. Send him along"
450,with the other prisoners to Inverness. 
451,JAMIE: The Laird goes too or you can hang me with him. I'll not go with
452,ye. 
453,"COLIN: No, go, Jamie, go. "
454,SERGEANT: We'll see about that. 
455,"GREY: Sergeant! What do you think, Doctor? Can this man be healed of"
456,his wound? 
457,"DOCTOR: With proper care, yes. "
458,GREY: Whether he'll get that where he is going is very doubtful. But

460,SERGEANT: Sir! 'Shun! You men escort these gentlemen and these
461,"prisoners to Inverness. I'll wait here for the Lieutenant. Come on,"
462,out. Get him down. 
463,DOCTOR: What will happen to us? 
464,"GREY: First you go to Inverness, and then perhaps a sea voyage? "
465,"SERGEANT: Do you good, rogue. Come on. "
466,"GREY: Just in time, Perkins. Just in time."
467,
468,[Cave]
469,
470,KIRSTY: This is the cave. They'll not find us here.
471,
472,(A narrow fissure widens out into a large cave.) 
473,"POLLY: You don't live here, do you? "
474,"KIRSTY: Oh, no. The family use it as a hide out after a cattle raid. "
475,POLLY: A cattle raid? You mean you rob people? 
476,KIRSTY: No! We only take from those who steal from us. 
477,"POLLY: Oh, it's dark. "
478,"KIRSTY: Ah, there we are. "
479,POLLY: That's a funny kind of match. 
480,KIRSTY: What? 
481,"POLLY: Match. Oh, it doesn't matter. "
482,"KIRSTY: Now, we keep a supply of food here. Oh no, there's only one"
483,wheat biscuit. 
484,POLLY: When was it left here? 
485,"KIRSTY: Well, about three months ago. "
486,"POLLY: Oh, it's a dog biscuit. "
487,KIRSTY: Biscuits are not baked for dogs. But please do begin. 
488,"POLLY: Oh, no, no, you start. I don't want to lose all my fillings."
489,"Teeth. Doesn't matter. You start. I'm not hungry, really. Got to make a"
490,plan. We saw them being marched away. Now where would they be taking
491,them? 
492,KIRSTY: Inverness gaol. 
493,"POLLY: Oh, look, don't start crying again. If they've taken them to"
494,"gaol, then we've got to get them out. Have you got any money? "
495,KIRSTY: But what would we need money for? 
496,"POLLY: Well, for food, of course. That biscuit isn't going to last very"
497,long. And for bribing guards with. What have we got we can sell? 
498,(Polly looks at her bracelet.) 
499,"POLLY: This won't fetch much, but at least its a start. "
500,KIRSTY: Why should you help us? You're English. 
501,"POLLY: They've got my friends too, remember? Yes, and I must get some"
502,proper clothes. 
503,"KIRSTY: Aye, why do you wear the short skirts of a bairn? You're a"
504,grown woman. 
505,"POLLY: Well, it would take too long to explain. "
506,(Polly notices a large ring on Kirsty's finger.) 
507,"POLLY: Hey, that ring. It's gold. Look, you've got to trust me. "
508,KIRSTY: It doesn't belong to me. It's my father's. 
509,"POLLY: Well, let me just look at it. Come on, now. I just want to look"
510,"at it, that's all. It's beautiful. We should get a lot for that. "
511,KIRSTY: We're not going to sell it! 
512,POLLY: Not even to save your father's life? 
513,KIRSTY: He wouldn't thank me. 
514,"POLLY: Oh, you're hopeless. Why not, for goodness sake? "
515,KIRSTY: He entrusted it to me before the battle. He would kill me if I
516,ever parted with it. 
517,"POLLY: I don't understand you people. Come on, give it to me. "
518,KIRSTY: No. 
519,"POLLY: Look, give it to me! It's the. Please yourself! You're just a"
520,stupid peasant. I'm off to help my friends. You can stay here and guard
521,your precious ring. 
522,"KIRSTY: Look, mind your step. It'll be dark soon. "
523,POLLY : Watch out for yourself. 
524,KIRSTY: You'll get lost.

528,(Polly walks along a rough track. An owl hoots.
529,Suddenly the ground gives way under her feet and she falls. Polly
530,"screams. Winded but unhurt, Polly realises she has fallen into an"
531,"animal trap. She tries to scramble out, as a hand clutching a dagger"

536,
537,POLLY: Don't. 
538,"KIRSTY: Oh, it's yourself. "
539,POLLY: You! Of course it's myself. Who did you think it was? 
540,KIRSTY: I thought a Redcoat had fallen into the animal trap. 
541,"POLLY: Well, by the look on your face I'm glad it wasn't. Come on, help"
542,me out of here. 
543,"KIRSTY: Well, look, give me your hand then. "
544,"POLLY: Wait a minute, I can't "
545,"KIRSTY: Well, come on. "
546,POLLY: Pull! 
547,KIRSTY: I'm pulling! 
548,(Kirsty falls into the pit as well.) 
549,POLLY: Are you hurt? 
550,"KIRSTY: Oh, no. Just a wee bruise or two and a lot of dirt. Now we're"
551,both trapped. 
552,POLLY: No we're not! Even your dour Scots lassies must have played
553,piggy-back. 
554,KIRSTY: What? I don't understand. 
555,"POLLY: Well, you bend down and I climb on top of you and scramble up."
556,"Look, I'll show you. "
557,KIRSTY: What? 
558,POLLY: Bend down here a minute. All right. 
559,KIRSTY: Oh! 
560,POLLY: You okay? 
561,"KIRSTY: Quick, will ye! You're no light weight. Oh, go on. Hurry! Come"
562,on. 
563,POLLY: Shh! There's a light. Soldiers. 
564,"KIRSTY: Redcoats. Oh, we're cornered. "
565,"POLLY: No, we're not. They'll soon pass. "
566,(They both crouch down as Ffinch and his men approach.)

571,"Couldn't catch a couple of wenches, could you? Call yourselves"
572,soldiers? The terror of the Highlands? You wouldn't frighten an
573,"one-armed dairy maid. Well, I've done enough walking for one day. Go"
574,"and fetch my horse. If you're not back within one hour, three hundred"
575,lashes apiece. Imbeciles! Give the lantern to me. I don't want to be
576,"left here in the dark. Right then, march! "
577,(The soldiers leave.)

579,[Animal trap]
580,
581, KIRSTY: He's staying there. 
582,"POLLY: Oh, not again. Didn't the women of your age do anything but cry?"
583,
584,KIRSTY: What? 
585,"POLLY: It doesn't matter. Listen, I've got an idea. Since our officer"
586,"has so obligingly parked himself outside our pit, we'll lure him in to"
587,join us. 
588,"KIRSTY: Oh, glory. "
589,"POLLY: We'll be able to deal with him. Now, this is what we are going"
590,to do. 
591,[Culloden moor]
592,
593,(Ffinch has started eating when an owl hoots.) 
594,FFINCH: What's that? 
595,"(He raises the lantern. Another woo sound and he draws his sword,"
596,moving towards the trap. More noises and then he falls in.) 
597,[Animal trap]
598,
599, KIRSTY: Move and I'll blow your brains out. 
600,"POLLY: She will too, so you better keep still. I'm going to take the"
601,sash for his feet and you take the belt for his wrists. 
602,FFINCH: Outrageous! Do you know that for assaulting a King's Officer
603,you could 
604,POLLY: I know. But you're not in charge now. The next thing is his
605,pockets. 
606,"KIRSTY: Ach, no! "
607,"POLLY: Look, he's probably got money and we need it. "
608,FFINCH: You can't mean to rob me. 
609,"KIRSTY: Look, you and your kind have robbed our glens. Look, he's got"
610,food. Chicken and bread. 
611,"POLLY: Great! Now, my gallant officer. "
612,FFINCH: I've done you no harm. 
613,KIRSTY: 'Tis no thanks to you that my father and Jamie weren't hanged.
614,They're probably rotting in gaol in Inverness by now.

618,(Sounds of coughing in the dungeon that serves as
619,Inverness gaol.) 
620,"BEN: Look after him, mate. He'll be all right. Okay, mate, okay. Take"
621,"it easy, take it easy. Sit down. "
622,"(Their cell is circular, waterlogged and moss-lined.) "
623,"BEN: A right rat hole this is, isn't it? "
624,"JAMIE: Oh, King George has worse than this, never fear. "
625,"BEN: Yeah, well, I'm glad Polly's out of it. Why did we ever get mixed"
626,"up in this, Doctor? "
627,DOCTOR: I'm glad we did. I'm just beginning to enjoy myself. Down with
628,King George! 
629,(Cheers.) 
630,"SENTRY: Silence, you Jacobite pigs. You don't want to feel this"
631,bayonet. 
632,"JAMIE: Oh, enjoy yourselves. So you are for the Prince after all? "
633,"DOCTOR: No, not really. I just like hearing the echo, that's all. Let's"
634,"have a look at his wound, shall we? "
635,JAMIE: Would you not be letting him now? 
636,DOCTOR: With care that'll heal. 
637,"JAMIE: Ach, here's you saying you're a doctor, you've not even bled him"
638,yet. 
639,BEN: What's he on about? 
640,DOCTOR: Blood letting. 
641,"BEN: Yeah, but that's stupid. "
642,JAMIE: It's the only way of curing the sick. 
643,"BEN: Killing him, more like. He's lost enough blood already. "
644,"DOCTOR: Oh, Isis and Osiris, is it meet? Aquarius, Aries, Taurus. "
645,"JAMIE: Oh, aye. "
646,BEN: (Now what are you mumbling about? 
647,"JAMIE: Whist, man. "
648,DOCTOR: Gemini and Taurus. When was the Laird born? 
649,JAMIE: In the fifth month. 
650,"DOCTOR: That's what I thought. Now, blood letting must wait until"
651,Taurus is in the ascendant. So it is willed. 
652,"BEN: You don't believe all that codswallop, do you? "
653,DOCTOR: Of course I do. So does he. He's never heard of germs. 
654,JAMIE: What was that word? 
655,DOCTOR: It's a secret word. 
656,"BEN: Yeah, germs, they're all around us. "
657,DOCTOR: Used by German doctors. 
658,"JAMIE: Oh, Ger-man. Germs. "
659,"DOCTOR: Yes. Have you got a handkerchief, Ben? "
660,"BEN: Yeah, here you are. "
661,DOCTOR: Good. 
662,"JAMIE: Ach, that wee lassies kerchief? Here, Doctor, use mine. "
663,DOCTOR: Thank you. Just a fresh dressing. 
664,(As the Doctor binds Colin's wound he notices an embroidered silk cloth
665,under his plaid.) 
666,"DOCTOR: Hello, what's this? "
667,JAMIE: Prince Charlie's personal standard. 
668,BEN: What's he doing with it? 
669,"JAMIE: Protecting it. Now put it back, will ye. If a sentry saw it "
670,"DOCTOR: No, wait. "
671,The Doctor wraps it around his body under his coat.) 
672,JAMIE: What are you doing? 
673,DOCTOR: What chance do you think he has of evading the gallows with
674,this on him? 
675,JAMIE: Well 
676,"DOCTOR: Besides, it's really rather nice and warm. Let's have a tune to"
677,cheer us all up. 
678,(The Doctor produces his recorder.) 
679,"BEN: Yeah, I didn't think we'd heard the last of that. "
680,SENTRY: Silence! 
681,"JAMIE: Whist, man! "
682,"DOCTOR: Well, you're a loyal Jacobite, aren't you? This is your tune."
683,"Come on, everybody, join in. "
684,"SENTRY: Silence, I say! I warned you rebels once! Now we'll see what a"
685,touch of the bayonet will do. Now then!
686,BEN: The guard is coming down now. 
687,SENTRY: You! 
688,DOCTOR: (German) Thank heavens. Did you hear that tune? 
689,SENTRY: Heard a rebel dirge. 
690,"DOCTOR: They were singing it to drive me out of my mind, as I'm a loyal"
691,subject to King George the Second! 
692,SENTRY: Now what's that got to do with me? 
693,"DOCTOR: They know of a plot to murder your general, the Duke of"
694,Cumberland. 
695,JAMIE: What? 
696,"BEN: Oh, come off it, Doctor. "
697,JAMIE: I knew he wasne one of us. 
698,DOCTOR: Take me to Solicitor Grey. Perhaps we're in time to prevent it.
699,
700,SENTRY: Why didn't you speak about this before? 
701,"DOCTOR: Well, it's only just discovered. That rogue is party to it! "
702,(The prisoners shout and the guards take the Doctor away.) 
703,"BEN: Well done, mate. "
704,JAMIE: What do you mean? Why don't you go and join your friend? 
705,"BEN: Oh, calm down. Can't you see it was all a fiddle? "
706,JAMIE: Fiddle? 
707,"BEN: Well, a trick, a ruse to get out of here. "
708,JAMIE: I don't understand you. 
709,"BEN: Oh, blimey, look. Outside he's got a chance to get away and rescue"
710,us. What chance do you think he's got paddling round in here? 
711,"JAMIE: Aye, nevertheless, I'm still worried. "
712,"BEN: Now don't you worry about him, mate, worry about us. See that"
713,"line? Well, that's where the water level comes up to. And tonight is"
714,not my bath night.

717,
718,"POLLY: seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty."
719,Twenty guineas. How far do you think it will get us? 
720,KIRSTY: I've never seen so much money in all my days. 
721,"FFINCH: You'll both hang for this, you know. "
722,"POLLY: You're very fond of hanging, aren't you, Mister. Hey, what's"
723,your name? 
724,FFINCH: I refuse to tell you. 
725,"POLLY: Oh, we're very brave all of a sudden. Watch him, Kirsty. He must"
726,"have some form of. Ah-ha, yes. Algernon Thomas Alfred Ffinch. Two 'f's!"
727,"Lieutenant in the Honourable Colonel Atwood's Rifles. So, I bet the"
728,Colonel would be highly interested to hear how his Lieutenant F-finch
729,was captured by two girls. 
730,FFINCH: You would not tell. 
731,"POLLY: Oh, wouldn't we? Give me the knife, Kirsty. "
732,FFINCH: What are you going to do? 
733,"POLLY: Never fear, Algernon Thomas F-finch. We're just after a small"
734,"souvenir, that's all. There we are. This piece of hair and this disc"
735,will be proof enough in case the Colonel doesn't believe us. 
736,"KIRSTY: But, but why? "
737,POLLY: We need an ally in the enemy camp and I think we've found one.
738,"Right, Algernon? "
739,FFINCH: It's sheer blackmail. 
740,"POLLY: Right again. Come on, Kirsty, let's go before this officer's"
741,"soldiers get back. Bye bye, Algy dear. We'll be seeing you in"
742,"Inverness. Come on, Kirsty. Up you go. All right? "
743,KIRSTY: Oh no. I

745,
746,(The lawyers meet with a sea captain in private.) 
747,"TRASK: Well, lawyer, my old cattle boat's ready for its livestock."
748,Belay there! What in thunder are you laughing at? 
749,"GREY: It will be no laughing matter for any of us if we are caught, I"
750,can assure you. That is why we must begin loading the prisoners
751,tonight. 
752,TRASK: Tonight? 
753,"GREY: Before the judges are ready to try the rebels, we'll have them"
754,all safely on plantations. 
755,TRASK: Arr. A Highlander will do twice the work of one of your black
756,slaves. 
757,PERKINS: At least twice. 
758,TRASK: Who asked for your opinion? 
759,"GREY: Silence, Captain. I will not have my clerk bullied. I have enough"
760,"evidence on you to send you to the gallows ten times over, and don't"
761,you forget it. 
762,(A knock on the door.) 
763,GREY: Come in! Well? 
764,"SENTRY: One of the prisoners, sir. He insists on seeing you. Says he"
765,"has some important information about a plot against the Duke's life,"
766,sir. 
767,GREY: Why come to me? 
768,"SENTRY: Says he won't speak to no one else but you, sir. "
769,GREY: Which prisoner is it? 
770,"SENTRY: The German doctor, sir. "
771,"GREY: Ah, interesting. Bring him in at once. "
772,SENTRY: Sir. 
773,"GREY: Well man, what are you waiting? Perkins. "
774,"(Perkins reluctantly hands a shilling to the sentry, who then leaves.) "
775,"GREY: Now, gentlemen, I suggest you start loading the prisoners at"
776,"once. Here is your warrant. And to avoid comment, you'd better take"
777,them the back way. 
778,"SENTRY: The prisoner, sir. "
779,GREY: Perkins. Trask. 
780,(Trask and Perkins leave past the Doctor.) 
781,DOCTOR: Auf Wiedersehen. 
782,TRASK: Arr. 
783,(Grey takes a flintlock pistol from the case on his desk and puts it on
784,the table.) 
785,GREY: You may go. 
786,SENTRY: Sir. 
787,(The sentry leaves.) 
788,"GREY: Now, Doctor, your story. I hope it is an entertaining one. It has"
789,"cost me a silver shilling. Very well then, what is the nature of this"
790,plot? 
791,DOCTOR: There is no plot. 
792,"GREY: Have a care, Doctor. You waste my time at your peril. "
793,"DOCTOR: Would the chance to lay your hands on 15,000 pounds be a waste"
794,of your time? 
795,"GREY: What would a vagabond like you know of such a sum, pray? "
796,DOCTOR: The personal standard of Prince Charles Edward. 
797,GREY: Indeed. 
798,DOCTOR: Whoever was entrusted with this standard stood closest to the
799,"councils of the Prince, you would agree? He would also know where the"
800,Prince was most likely to run to. 
801,GREY: Which prisoner carried this standard? 
802,DOCTOR: That must remain my secret for the time being. 
803,GREY: There are ways to force your tongue. 
804,"DOCTOR: But why employ them, since we are both on the same side? The"
805,"30,000 pounds reward for the capture of the Prince is surely enough to"
806,satisfy both of us. 
807,"GREY: Ah, you have some fresh information as to his whereabouts? "
808,"DOCTOR: I am on the track of some, but I need a free hand. "
809,"(Throwing the flag over Grey's head, the Doctor snatches the pistol.) "
810,DOCTOR: Don't cry out. I'm not very expert with these things and it
811,just might go off in your face. Turn around and put your hands behind
812,you. 
813,GREY: You'll pay for this. 
814,DOCTOR: Just keep very still. 
815,(The Doctor uses Grey's own belt to tie his hands.) 
816,"DOCTOR: There, now turn around. Why, great heavens, man, your throat. "
817,GREY: What? 
818,DOCTOR: It's so swollen. Does it hurt you? 
819,"GREY: No, of course not. "
820,DOCTOR: Say ahh. 
821,GREY: What? 
822,DOCTOR: Ahh. 
823,GREY: Ahh. Mphf! 
824,(The Doctor stuffs a handkerchief into Grey's mouth.) 
825,DOCTOR: I've never seen a silent lawyer before. 
826,(A knock at the door.) 
827,"DOCTOR: Would you mind just waiting in here? Another patient, you"
828,understand. 
829,(The Doctor shoves Grey into a cupboard then sits at the solicitor's
830,desk.) 
831,DOCTOR: Enter. 
832,"PERKINS: Oh, er, pardon, I thought that "
833,DOCTOR: You thought what? 
834,"PERKINS: The, the Solicitor? "
835,DOCTOR: Your master's a very sick man. He's gone to lie down. It lucky
836,"for him I was called in time. Well, great heavens, man. Your eyes! "
837,PERKINS: What? 
838,DOCTOR: Your eyes. Come over here to the light. 
839,"(Perkins sits in the chair and the Doctor leans over him, bringing out"
840,a magnifying glass to examine his eyes.) 
841,"Your eyes, man. You suffer from headaches? "
842,"PERKINS: No, I don't. "
843,(The Doctor bangs Perkins' head on the desk.) 
844,DOCTOR: No headaches? 
845,"PERKINS: Well, er. Ow! "
846,(Another thump.) 
847,DOCTOR: Oh dear. You call me a liar? 
848,"PERKINS: Well, no, no, no, no. Me head does ache. "
849,"DOCTOR: Of course it does, what did you expect? Your eyes. "
850,PERKINS: Me eyes? What did you find? 
851,DOCTOR: Print blindness. You read too much. 
852,"PERKINS: Well, 'tis true, I'm a clerk. What must I do? "
853,DOCTOR: You must rest them for at least an hour. 
854,"PERKINS: But, I "
855,"DOCTOR: That is my prescription. Ignore it at your peril. Now, lie down"
856,on the table. That's right. And put this over your eyes and rest them
857,for at least an hour. 
858,(A thumping sound comes from the cupboard.) 
859,PERKINS: What's that knocking? 
860,"DOCTOR: Knocking? It's not knocking, it's in your mind. In your eyes."
861,"Now rest your eyes and the knocking will grow fainter, and fainter, and"
862,"fainter. One hour, remember. "
863,"PERKINS: One hour, Doctor. One hour. "

872,"SERGEANT: Oh, there you are, sir. "
873,"FFINCH: What took you so long, you jackanapes? "
874,"SERGEANT: Well, we made the best time we could in the dark, sir, but"
875,"it's hard to see our way, you see? "
876,"FFINCH: Well, don't just stand there. Get me out of this infernal hole."
877,
878,"SERGEANT: All right, you two, I'll handle this. You go and stand guard"
879,by the Lieutenant's horse. Come on.

886,"FFINCH: Confound it, man, what are you jabbering about? "
887,"SERGEANT: Well, I mean to say, sir, you see, er, officers don't usually"
888,fall into pits. 
889,"FFINCH: You'll regret this, Sergeant. "
890,"SERGEANT: Ah, it isn't me, sir. You see, it's the men I'm thinking"
891,"about. I mean, they're not used to it, like. I mean, they're going to"
892,"be very slow, sir. And they're going to be very dry. "
893,"FFINCH: I see! Well, here's some money to drink with and I hope it"
894,chokes you! 
895,(Then he remembers the girls have taken all his money.)

904,PERKINS: The Doctor says he must rest too. 
905,TRASK: Rest? 
906,(Trask opens the cupboard to reveal Grey.) 
907,"TRASK: Now what have we here then? A pretty sight you look, lawyer. And"
908,"what might this be a cure for, Saint Vitus's Dance? "

910,"PERKINS: Well, I didn't know. It's me head. "
911,"GREY: One more such folly, t'will need no further cures. "
912,TRASK: The Prince's standard.

1039,BEN: What? 
1040,WILLY: This man's an Englishman. One more blow we can strike for
1041,Scotland. 
1042,BEN: Ay? What are you talking about? 
1043,WILLY: One more piece of vermin to be stamped out. 
1044,BEN: What are you going to do? 
1045,WILLY: Put the foot into him and tramp his English bones into the deck.
1046,Back! Back! I discovered him. The first blow will be mine. 
1047,COLIN: Will MacKay would never strike a friend of the Prince. 
1048,WILLY: I know that voice.

1062,"JAMIE: Who, Ben? He's a deserting English sailor. So we take him back"
1063,home. 
1064,WILLY: A sailor. I'm a man of the sea myself. The master of this very
1065,vessel. 
1066,"BEN: If you're the skipper here, what's that Trask geezer doing on the"
1067,bridge? 
1068,WILLY: That shark was my mate. I was running arms from France past the
1069,blockade. Trask betrayed me. The Navy boarded the Annabelle and now
1070,he's sailing the ship for King George! 
1071,BEN: Oh yeah? 
1072,WILLY: You doubt my word? 
1073,"BEN: Oh no, skipper, just the bit about working for King George. "
1074,WILLY: What do you mean? 
1075,"BEN: Well, we're not exactly being treated like prisoners of war, now"
1076,are we? Doesn't it occur to you that this Trask could be using this
1077,vessel without the knowledge of his King and Sovereign in order to work
1078,some big fiddle on his own account? 
1079,WILLY: Fiddle? 
1080,"BEN: Look, mate, he is going to sell us like the stinking fish he"

1095,have to spend our money on oranges for? 
1096,"POLLY: You'll see. Hey, these are great. Last time we went back to the"

1104,"sellers, don't you? I mean Nell Gwyn and all that? "
1105,"KIRSTY: Nell Gwyn? Well, of course there are orange sellers in"

1219,"TRASK: Willy MacKay, former master of this vessel. I should have done"
1220,for him long ago.

1222,"MacKay here offers you. Death with honour? What, lingering on the end"
1223,"of a halter? Followed, may I remind you, by quartering and the like"

1225,for your eventual liberty. 
1226,WILLY: Liberty?

1239,BEN: Can I read it first? 
1240,GREY: Of course.

1245,him and drop him from the highest yard-arm.

1296,"DOCTOR: Before you leave, because I am going to watch you all the time."
1297,And if you move 
1298,"PERKINS: Yes, I understand, sir. "
1299,"DOCTOR: Now, girls, let's leave this rough place. Ten minutes,"
1300,remember? 
1301,"PERKINS: Ten minutes, Doctor. Ten minutes."
1302,
1303,[Barn]
1304,
1305,"POLLY: Come on, it's quite safe. All right? "
1306,"DOCTOR: Very good, very good. "
1307,POLLY: That horrible little man's face. 
1308,KIRSTY: Twas a picture right enough. 
1309,"POLLY: Hey, why did he call you the German doctor, Doctor? Doctor, be"
1310,careful! 
1311,KIRSTY: You'll have the town upon us! 
1312,(The Doctor has fired the pistol.) 
1313,DOCTOR: It's not loaded. They're dangerous things. 
1314,"POLLY: You know, those dresses really do suit you, Doctor. "
1315,"DOCTOR: Oh, you saucy girl. "
1316,KIRSTY: You're the very image of my old granny McLaren. 
1317,"POLLY: You're wonderful, Doctor. "
1318,DOCTOR: I know. 
1319,POLLY: You've even managed to cheer old Kirsty up. 
1320,"KIRSTY: Oh, aye. I'd forgotten. "
1321,POLLY: Now what are we going to do? 
1322,"DOCTOR: Do? What do you mean, do? "
1323,"POLLY: Doctor, don't go all sleepy on us now. We've got to do"
1324,something. 
1325,"DOCTOR: All right, go ahead. "
1326,POLLY: If only we knew where the others were. 
1327,DOCTOR: They're on the ship. 
1328,POLLY: What? 
1329,"DOCTOR: They're on the ship, the Annabelle. Master's name, Trask. Not a"
1330,nice man. You wouldn't like him. 
1331,(The Doctor lies back in the hay and closes his eyes.) 
1332,"POLLY: Doctor! Doctor! Look, if they're on the ship, then we've got to"
1333,get them off it. Or 
1334,DOCTOR: Or what? 
1335,POLLY: Or capture the ship. 
1336,KIRSTY: What would we do that for? 
1337,"POLLY: Well, couldn't you sail to somewhere safe? I mean, wasn't France"
1338,"your ally, or something? "
1339,KIRSTY: I won't leave Scotland. 
1340,DOCTOR: It'd be safer. 
1341,KIRSTY: Never. 
1342,"DOCTOR: Well it wouldn't be for very long. Just for seven, just for a"
1343,"few years, and then it'd be safe to come back. "
1344,KIRSTY: But why should I leave my own country? 
1345,"DOCTOR: Oh, please yourself. But you and your father may get killed if"
1346,you stay in the glens. 
1347,KIRSTY: Are you sure there's no other way? 
1348,"POLLY: Look, the Doctor says it won't be for long. "
1349,KIRSTY: What must we do? 
1350,POLLY: We must make a plan. Doctor. 
1351,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
1352,POLLY: Doctor! 
1353,DOCTOR: Hmm! 
1354,POLLY: Have you got a plan for us? 
1355,DOCTOR: No. 
1356,"POLLY: Oh, go on, I know you better than that. You must have a plan. "
1357,"DOCTOR: Well, it's just a wee idea really. "
1358,POLLY: Go on. 
1359,"DOCTOR: I've only just thought about it. It won't work, but it'd be a"
1360,try. Anyone got any money? 
1361,"POLLY: Yes, seventeen guineas that we pinched from the English"
1362,Lieutenant. 
1363,"DOCTOR: That's a fortune in these days. Now, we want weapons, lots of"
1364,"them, and a rowing boat. "
1365,KIRSTY: I can get a rowing boat. 
1366,"DOCTOR: Good, and we can buy the weapons. "
1367,POLLY: Can we? 
1368,"DOCTOR: From the English soldiers. Well, they're bound to have heaps of"
1369,weapons as souvenirs. 
1370,"POLLY: Yes, but will they sell them to us? "
1371,DOCTOR: You don't know the English soldier. He'd sell his grandmother
1372,for tuppence ha'penny. 
1373,KIRSTY: And then? 
1374,DOCTOR: We smuggle them aboard the Annabelle. 
1375,POLLY: That's great. And then what? 
1376,"DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know, we'll think of something. I must get some"
1377,sleep. 
1378,POLLY: Doctor! Doctor! Oh.

1382,(Perkins and Grey have been rowed over. Grey goes
1383,"aboard, followed by Perkins carrying the papers.) "
1384,"GREY: Mister Trask! Devil take him, where is the man? Mister Trask! Ah,"
1385,you. Go and fetch Mister Trask. Mister Trask! 
1386,TRASK: Aye? 
1387,GREY: Is everything in readiness? 
1388,TRASK: It is. 
1389,"GREY: I've had Perkins here copy out three contracts, just to make"
1390,"sure. And if anyone tries that trick again of tearing them up, shoot"
1391,him down immediately. 
1392,TRASK: Don't you worry about that. 
1393,GREY: We need two of the contracts to be signed. 
1394,"TRASK: Every man jack of them will sign. If not with ink, then with"
1395,blood. Tis all the one to me. 
1396,"GREY: No. You're not dealing with slaves, man. These Highlanders are"
1397,"men of high courage and resolution. Flog but one of them, they'll all"
1398,stand together and refuse to sign a thing. You'll undo everything I've
1399,"worked for. No, once they're safely sold in Barbados they can be"
1400,"whipped to death for all I care. Until then, use a light fist, or"
1401,you'll answer to me. 
1402,"TRASK: And the London deserter, what about him? "
1403,GREY: Proceed with the ducking. It'll serve as a useful encouragement
1404,"to the rest. Perkins, go below. Make the preparations. "
1405,"PERKINS: Yes, sir. "
1406,"GREY: And, Perkins, bring the deserter on deck. "
1407,"PERKINS: Of course, sir."

1411,(Polly and Kirsty have obtained a meagre supply of
1412,weapons and are waiting for the Doctor to come back.) 
1413,"POLLY: Haven't done very well, have we? "
1414,KIRSTY: They wouldn't take me seriously. 
1415,"POLLY: No, nor me. I do hope the Doctor's had better luck. (knocking)"
1416,Who's there? 
1417,DOCTOR [OC}: Me. 
1418,(The Doctor pushes in a small hand barrow covered with a tarpaulin.) 
1419,"POLLY: Let's see, Doctor. What have you got? "
1420,DOCTOR: No. Let's see yours first. 
1421,"POLLY: Oh look, don't tease us. Look. "
1422,DOCTOR: Oh. It's a start. 
1423,"(The Doctor reveals a large pile of swords, muskets, and pistols.) "
1424,KIRSTY: You must have robbed the Duke's arsenal. 
1425,"DOCTOR: Yes, something like that. "
1426,POLLY: You're fantastic. 
1427,DOCTOR: I know. 
1428,"KIRSTY: Look, there's a bonnie one. "
1429,DOCTOR: Just a minute. 
1430,KIRSTY: What is it? 
1431,"DOCTOR: This ring. Now, let me see. "
1432,"POLLY: Oh, that. It's her father's. She won't let you touch it. "
1433,DOCTOR: I'm not surprised. It's not her father's. 
1434,KIRSTY: You're lying! 
1435,POLLY: What! 
1436,KIRSTY: It is! 
1437,DOCTOR: Then why has it the Stuarts' seal? 
1438,KIRSTY: My father bade me not tell where he got it. 
1439,DOCTOR: Until the right time. That time has now arrived. 
1440,KIRSTY: The Prince gave it to my father off his own hand in heat of
1441,battle. My father saved the Prince's life. 
1442,DOCTOR: Then it is right and proper that it should now save his life.
1443,Give it me. Thank you. I wonder. Bait. 
1444,KIRSTY: What? 
1445,DOCTOR: Bait for a very greedy man.

1451,"TRASK: Right, lads, take him up. "
1452,(Ben is hoisted into the air and swung out over the side of the ship.

1461,again. But there is no one on the end of the rope.) 
1462,GREY: He's not escaped? 
1463,"(On the other side of the ship, Ben surfaces in the shadows. He catches"
1464,his breath then swims for the shore. A fog descends and he loses track
1465,of the time.)

1467,[Quayside]
1468,
1469,(Finally he reaches the quay and just manages to
1470,"pull himself onto the jetty. After a few gasps, he looks up to see the"
1471,business end of a musket.) 
1472,"BEN: Oh, no. Not after all that. I give up. "
1473,(The soldier peels off his moustache.) 
1474,"BEN: It's you, Doctor. "
1475,DOCTOR: Who else would be walking around the jetty at this time of
1476,night dressed like a soldier who'd been wounded in battle? 
1477,"BEN: Yeah, you've got a point there. But why? "
1478,"DOCTOR: Why? Because I like it here. Besides, it keeps the other"
1479,soldiers away. 
1480,"BEN: Oh, I'm cold and hungry. "
1481,DOCTOR: I know just the place. Hold that. I'll just get these things
1482,aboard the boat. 
1483,BEN: The boat?

1485,Come on. 
1486, [Captain's cabin]
1487,
1488,"PERKINS: There you are, sir, all signed and"
1489,attested. It but wants your signature. 
1490,GREY: Not before time. 
1491,"TRASK: A little wine for your cold heart, lawyer? "
1492,GREY: I never mix liquor with business. I would advise you to do the
1493,"same. We sail on the morning tide, remember. "
1494,"TRASK: Happen it's too foggy to sail, what then? "
1495,"GREY: (sternly) You sail, fog or no fog. "
1496,TRASK: And crash the old girl's timbers on Chanonry Point. 
1497,GREY: I took you for a seaman. 
1498,"TRASK: Why, that I am. I am! Trask'll get your cargo of little booties"
1499,"to Barbados, never fear. That's what really counts, lawyer. Not those"
1500,dried up bits of parchment of yours. 
1501,"GREY: Without these bits of parchment, we would all sail foul of the"
1502,King's law. 
1503,TRASK: Law? What does the law or anyone care for those Highland cattle
1504,we carry? 
1505,GREY: Nothing. But to take these cattle safely to the slave
1506,"plantations, before their strength is sapped by his Majesty's prisons,"
1507,that takes skill and preparation. 
1508,TRASK: And what would happen to you and me if this trade were to be
1509,discovered to the Duke? 
1510,"GREY: That will never happen, Trask. There are but three of us privy to"
1511,"this secret. I can answer for myself and Perkins. Ay, Perkins? "
1512,"PERKINS: Oh, yes sir. Yes sir, indeed you may. "
1513,"GREY: As for you, Captain, you must answer for yourself. "
1514,"TRASK: Twas but in jest. You know me, Solicitor. I'm your man. "
1515,"GREY: Aye, and that is the way you will remain, Mister Trask."

1520,"BEN: Ah, that's better. Never thought I'd live to see a meal like that"
1521,again. 
1522,"POLLY: But listen Ben, how did you manage to get loose? Underwater, I"
1523,mean? 
1524,"BEN: Well it's the old Houdini trick, duchess. You flex your muscles"
1525,"when they tie you up, then when you're ready, you relax them. Well that"
1526,way you're half the size you were before. Get it? 
1527,KIRSTY: No. 
1528,POLLY: And that's all there is to it? 
1529,"BEN: Well, almost all. "
1530,POLLY: I bet. 
1531,POLLY: Hey you've got your own clothes back. 
1532,"DOCTOR: Yes. Can you imagine, I found them thrown out on the rubbish"
1533,"dump, behind the inn. "
1534,"BEN: Amazing, isn't it? Well mine should be dry by now. "
1535,"POLLY: I liked you better in your dress, Doctor. "
1536,"KIRSTY: Aye, you made a good granny. "
1537,"DOCTOR: Now then, do we all know what we have to do? Ben? "
1538,"BEN: Yeah, I take you out to the ship in the rowing boat. Then double"
1539,"round the back smartish while they're sorting you out, and then pass"
1540,the weapons through the porthole. 
1541,"POLLY: While Kirsty and I just sit here and wait for you to get back,"
1542,if you ever do. No fear. 
1543,KIRSTY: We've done enough waiting. 
1544,DOCTOR: But it may be dangerous. They may not swallow my story. 
1545,"BEN: Yeah, and they may see me in the boat, even with this on. "
1546,(Ben pulls a tam-o'-shanter over his face.) 
1547,DOCTOR: I would like a hat like that. 
1548,"POLLY: Nevertheless, we're not going to let you two out of our sights,"
1549,"are we, Kirsty? Well, you get into such terrible trouble without us. "
1550,"DOCTOR: Very well, you shall come in the rowing boat. It might be a"
1551,good idea at that.

1557,WILLY: I can hardly believe it. They've played
1558,right into Solicitor Grey's hands. My own crew amongst them. 
1559,COLIN: Can you blame them? It's a poor choice between the gallows and
1560,the plantations. A man will clutch at any straw to save his skin. 
1561,"JAMIE: And what will they do with us, sir? "
1562,"COLIN: I fear they will make an example of us, once Trask gets away to"
1563,sea. 
1564,"WILLY: He'll not let me live, that's for sure. Ach well, better a fast"
1565,death than a lingering one under the overseers. I've no regrets.

1571,collect this amount in gold on delivery of the prisoners and render
1572,strict accounting to me. Is that clear? 
1573,"PERKINS: Yes, sir, Mister Grey, sir. Quite clear, sir. You may trust me"
1574,"to the death, sir. "
1575,GREY: Now I must return ashore. I shall expect to see you in London at
1576,"the end of October. Meanwhile, keep a close eye on Trask. He's not "
1577,"TRASK : Right lads, bring him down. "
1578,(Trask flings open the door and the Doctor is dragged in.)

1592,PERKINS: Please? 
1593,"GREY: Well, go on. "
1594,"DOCTOR: Now then, let me see, where did I put it. No, it's not in"
1595,"there. I transferred it from there, into this pocket. Well it's not"
1596,"there now, perhaps it's in here. "
1597,"TRASK: Why, you! "
1598,"GREY: I would advise you to find this token quickly, before I leave you"
1599,to the tender mercies of Mister Trask. 
1600,DOCTOR: Got it! 
1601,(The Doctor produces Kirsty's ring.) 
1602,DOCTOR: Here we are. Look at the seal. 
1603,GREY: The Stuart arms. 
1604,"DOCTOR: Well, Mister Grey? "
1605,GREY: Where did you get this? 
1606,DOCTOR: From the hands of Prince Charles himself. 
1607,"GREY: Where, man, where? "
1608,DOCTOR: In prison. 
1609,GREY: I don't follow. 
1610,DOCTOR: It's perfectly easy. Prince Charles disguised himself as a
1611,Highlander and was taken prisoner with the rest of the rebels. 
1612,GREY: And where is he now? 
1613,DOCTOR: I wonder what that information would be worth? Now let me see.

1659,sure?

1714,"DOCTOR: Ben, well done, well done, well done. Kirsty, here's your"
1715,father. There we are. Polly 
1716,KIRSTY: Father! 
1717,DOCTOR: Got lost in the fog. 
1718,"POLLY: Well done, well done. "
1719,"BEN: Oh, don't over do it, Pol. "
1720,POLLY: But we've won! 
1721,DOCTOR: Only for the moment. 
1722,POLLY: What do you mean? 
1723,"BEN: Well, the real job's only just beginning. Getting back to the"
1724,Tardis with only a rough idea of where it is and the whole English army
1725,out to stop us. 
1726,POLLY: What are we going to do? 
1727,"BEN: Well, we're going to get ashore before they get under way. That's"
1728,"the first thing. Right, Doctor? "
1729,DOCTOR: Right. 
1730,WILLY: Stand by the capstan. 
1731,DOCTOR: We have to go ashore now. 
1732,"WILLY: Oh, don't bother me now, man. Stand by at the end of the rope"
1733,here. 
1734,COLIN: What about the prisoners? 
1735,DOCTOR: We'll take Mister Grey ashore as a hostage. 
1736,COLIN: And the clerk? 
1737,DOCTOR: Well I 
1738,"PERKINS: Now, may I have converse with you. "
1739,"COLIN: Yea, man, yea. "
1740,"PERKINS: Don't send me ashore with that man, sir. Now, if you are going"
1741,"to France, then maybe you can do with a secretary. Especially one who"
1742,is conversant with the French tongue. 
1743,"COLIN: Shifting with the wind, you rogue. Well, Doctor, what do you"
1744,say? 
1745,DOCTOR: Many of your people speak French? 
1746,"COLIN: Aye, but little. "
1747,DOCTOR: Then take him with you. He'll stay loyal enough. 
1748,"PERKINS: Oh, I will, I will, sir. "
1749,"DOCTOR: Till the wind shifts again. Laird, we must go. "
1750,"COLIN: Doctor, I "
1751,DOCTOR: Bring the prisoner over! 
1752,PERKINS: Mister Solicitor! 
1753,"GREY: Well, Perkins? "
1754,(Perkins snaps his fingers at Grey.) 
1755,PERKINS: I've been wanting to do that for a long time. You've no idea
1756,the pleasure that gave me. 
1757,GREY: Why you 
1758,PERKINS: Sir. 
1759,[Quayside]
1760,
1761,POLLY: I can't even see the ship. 
1762,"BEN: No, they said they'd send us a signal before they went. Hey, look."
1763,There it is! 
1764,(A small light waves across the firth and vanishes.) 
1765,POLLY: Do you think they'll beat the English blockade? 
1766,DOCTOR: The fog will help them. More than it will help us. 
1767,POLLY: We never even said goodbye to Jamie. 
1768,"BEN: No, he just disappeared. I wonder where he went to. "
1769,JAMIE: Right here. 
1770,BEN: Jamie! 
1771,POLLY: Jamie! 
1772,"JAMIE: Aye, himself. "
1773,"BEN: Well, why didn't you go with the others? "
1774,"JAMIE: Well, let's say I fancied my chances here better. Besides,"
1775,"you'll need someone to guide you through the glen, won't you? "
1776,BEN: How did you know? 
1777,"DOCTOR: Glad to have you with us, Jamie. "
1778,POLLY: But won't you be in danger here though? 
1779,"JAMIE: Ach, if they can survive here, so can I. "
1780,"BEN: Hey, watch it! Quick, through these doors. "
1781,[Boathouse]
1782,
1783,(Ben and Jamie drag Grey inside as two soldiers
1784,appear.) 
1785,POLLY: They're going away. It's all right. 
1786,GREY: Help! 
1787,JAMIE: One more move and you're a dead man. 
1788,DOCTOR: They heard. 
1789,POLLY: But what if they find us? 
1790,DOCTOR: Shh. 
1791,"(The soldiers enter, see nothing and turn to leave.) "
1792,GREY: Mmph! 
1793,(Ben and Jamie tackle one Redcoat as the Doctor grapples the other.
1794,They overpower the soldiers and knock them out as Grey makes his
1795,escape.) 
1796,JAMIE: I'm certainly glad I'm on your side. 
1797,DOCTOR: Grey! 
1798,POLLY: The window! 
1799,"DOCTOR: No. No, Ben. It's too late. "
1800,BEN: But he was our hostage. They'll never let us get to the Tardis
1801,now! 
1802,"DOCTOR: We'll find someone else, eh, Polly? "
1803, [Outside the Sea Eagle Inn]
1804,
1805,FFINCH: What the? 
1806,(He turns to see Ben holding a pistol to his chest.) 
1807,"BEN: We want your company, mate. "
1808,DOCTOR: If you don't mind. 
1809,"POLLY: You won't refuse us, Algy dear. "
1810,"FFINCH: Oh, this is really too much. "
1811,POLLY: This way. 
1812,"COLONEL: Damn it, man. Where the devil do you think you're going? "
1813,FFINCH: Colonel! 
1814,"COLONEL: Well, have you forgotten it's your deal, Ffinch? "
1815,"FFINCH: Yes, sir, I know. But, I was just "
1816,"COLONEL: Well, who are these vagabonds? "
1817,"FFINCH: Well, Colonel they're "
1818,"DOCTOR: (German) Doctor von Wer at your service. Remedies for the ague,"
1819,"the twitch, the colic, the warts and the gout. "
1820,COLONEL: The gout? I haven't got the gout. 
1821,"DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no. I wouldn't waste your time with that, a"
1822,"fine healthy gentleman like yourself. No, it's this ring you see, sir. "
1823,"FFINCH: Perhaps we'd better get back to the game, sir. The night air. "
1824,"COLONEL: Oh, blast the night air. Let me see. The Pretender's ring!"
1825,"Where'd you get this, man? "
1826,"DOCTOR: Well, you go up there and to the left. No perhaps it's better"
1827,to explain this way. To the right 
1828,COLONEL: Look what are you talking about? 
1829,"DOCTOR: No. On second thought, perhaps the other way. We were taking"
1830,"the Lieutenant, you see, sir. "
1831,"FFINCH: The game, sir. "
1832,"COLONEL: Confound the game, this is the Prince's ring. Go with them."
1833,Take an attachment. 
1834,"DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, sir. "
1835,COLONEL: What? 
1836,"DOCTOR: That might frighten the blackguard, sir. We are enough to"
1837,apprehend him. 
1838,"COLONEL: All right, go on, Lieutenant. You have your orders, what are"
1839,you waiting for? 
1840,"FFINCH: Yes, sir. But, this wench "
1841,(Polly starts to pull out Ffinch's ID disc which she is wearing around
1842,her neck.) 
1843,"FFINCH: Yes, sir. Very good, sir. "
1844,COLONEL: And when you have them 
1845,"DOCTOR: We will bring him back to you, sir. Right? "
1846,COLONEL: Right.
1847,
1848,[Cottage]
1849,
1850,(Almost dawn.) 
1851,JAMIE: You know where you are now? 
1852,"BEN: Yeah, I won't forget this place in a hurry. "
1853,"DOCTOR: Well, it's time we said goodbye, Lieutenant. And thank you. "
1854,POLLY: I've been telling him all about Mister Grey's activities. 
1855,"BEN: Yeah, you want to nab him quick. "
1856,"POLLY: Oh, Algy, here you are and thank you very much. "
1857,(Polly gives Ffinch his ID disc.) 
1858,FFINCH: It was nothing. 
1859,(Suddenly Redcoats appear and Grey walks in.) 
1860,"GREY: Ah, so you found these rebels, Lieutenant? Well done. "
1861,FFINCH: No! 
1862,GREY: You can escort them with me to Inverness. You will not escape the
1863,"gallows this time, Doctor. Any of you. As for you, wench, I'll have you"
1864,tied to the tail of a cart and whipped from one end of 
1865,FFINCH: Silence! 
1866,GREY: What was that you said? 
1867,FFINCH: I've heard the whole story of your schemes from this young lady
1868,here. 
1869,GREY: You take the word of this 
1870,"DOCTOR: What wicked times we live in, Lieutenant. A prison commissioner"
1871,using his office to smuggle rebels out of the country. 
1872,"GREY: You're wasting your breath, Doctor. It was all perfectly legal."
1873,The rebels signed the contracts for transportation of their own free
1874,will. 
1875,"DOCTOR: Contracts? I don't believe I saw any contracts. Did you, Ben? "
1876,"BEN: No, I wouldn't know what they were. "
1877,DOCTOR: Or you Jamie? 
1878,JAMIE: Me? No. 
1879,"GREY: A lie, Lieutenant. The contracts were signed, I have them right"
1880,here in my 
1881,DOCTOR: So sad. Once a promising legal talent. 
1882,"FFINCH: There is only one end for slave traders, Solicitor. I'm placing"
1883,you under arrest. 
1884,"GREY: I warn you, Lieutenant "
1885,"FFINCH: I've had enough of your warnings, sir. Gag him, Sergeant. Take"
1886,him to prison under escort. 
1887,SERGEANT: Sir! 
1888,"GREY: No, wait! This is some sort of trick, you fool. If the Colonel"
1889,hears of this you'll be lucky to end up as a band master. 
1890,"FFINCH: Take him away, Sergeant. "
1891,"SERGEANT: Come on, you traitorous dog. "
1892,GREY: Fool. 
1893,SERGEANT: You men follow me. 
1894,(The Redcoats remove Grey.) 
1895,"FFINCH: Well, goodbye, Doctor. "
1896,DOCTOR: Goodbye. 
1897,BEN: Goodbye. 
1898,"POLLY: Wait. Algy, why did you do it? "
1899,"FFINCH: A chance to put paid to a villain, ma'am. "
1900,"POLLY: It wasn't just that, was it? "
1901,"FFINCH: Not quite, ma'am. "
1902,"POLLY: Thank you, Algy. (kiss) Goodbye. "
1903,"FFINCH: Well, I wouldn't linger here if I were you. These moors, you"
1904,"know, they're still scouring them for rebels. "
1905,DOCTOR: Goodbye. 
1906,FFINCH: Goodbye. 
1907,BEN: Ta-ta. 
1908,JAMIE: One thing I don't understand. Where those contracts went? 
1909,DOCTOR: I've no idea. 
1910,(The Doctor pulls the papers from his pocket.) 
1911,DOCTOR: Well how did they get there? 
1912,"BEN: You old fraud. Come on, we must go. "
1913,POLLY: What about Jamie? We can't leave him here. 
1914,DOCTOR: True. His ship's sailed. 
1915,POLLY: What will you do? 
1916,"JAMIE: Oh, I'll be all right. They won't catch me. "
1917,BEN: Did you hear that! They'll catch us all if we don't move fast. 
1918,"POLLY: Doctor, can we take him with us? "
1919,DOCTOR: If he teaches me to play the bagpipes. 
1920,"JAMIE: If you want, Doctor. "
1921,BEN: That's all we need. Come on. 
1922,"POLLY: Come on, Jamie. "
1923,JAMIE: But where are we going? 
1924,POLLY: You'll see.

1928,watches in amazement as the Doctor unlocks the blue box and goes
1929,"inside, followed by Ben. Jamie hesitates, so Polly takes his hand and"
