19,One 
20, (A young woman in yellow rags runs down the
21,"graffiti- covered walls of a corridor in a housing block, followed by"
22,the calls of a teenage gang. She is terrified.) 
23, [Tardis]
24,
25, (Mel is enthusiastic about the view on the scanner
26,"of a swimming pool area with tables and chairs, and statuary in a"
27,shaded colonnade.) 
28,"MEL: Look, Doctor, look. There's the swimming pool, right at the very"
29,"top of the building. Oh, it's wonderful. I can't wait to have a dip in"
30,"that. Paradise Towers, here we come. "
31,"DOCTOR: That's the problem with young people today, no spirit of"
32,adventure.
33,
34, [Potassium Street]
35,
36," (The voices finally stop shouting, then two girls"
37,shout out.) 
38,FIRE ESCAPE : It's no go. Leave her for another day. Cowardly
39,cutlet! 
40,BIN LINER : Leave her for the cleaners. 
41,"(The unseen girls leave, laughing, and the young woman starts to relax."
42,Then a shadow falls across her and she screams.)
43,
44, [Tardis]
45,
46,(The Paradise Towers promotional video continues on
47,the scanner.) 
48,"DOCTOR: I think that's enough of that, Mel. "
49,MEL: Why? It's great. 
50,"DOCTOR: Well, if you want to stay here watching a guide book when you"
51,"could actually be enjoying the real thing, that's up to you. "
52,MEL: You mean we're nearly there? 
53,DOCTOR: Paradise Towers any second now. 
54,MEL: Fantastic! 
55,DOCTOR: You may want to lie by the pool doing nothing all day. I intend
56,to explore. Paradise Towers is supposed to be a remarkable
57,"architectural achievement, I'm told. Won all sorts of awards way back"
58,"in the er, twenty first century. Are you ready? "
59,MEL: Ready? I can't wait. 
60,"(The Tardis materialises in a small, rubbish filled square area.) "
61,"DOCTOR: Well, here we are. "
62,(The Doctor opens the doors and Mel leaves. The Doctor collects his had
63,"and umbrella, and follows.)"
64,
65, [Outside the Tardis]
66,
67," MEL: Oh, no. "
68,(The Doctor kicks over a box and a rat runs away.) 
69,DOCTOR: Ah! Highly intelligent creatures. Just look at this. 
70,(A stenciled image on the wall.) 
71,"DOCTOR: Extraordinary. Oh, and this. "
72,(He picks up a circuit board.) 
73,MEL: It's just rubbish. 
74,DOCTOR: Nothing's just rubbish if you have an enquiring mind. 
75,"MEL: No, Doctor. "
76,"DOCTOR: Well, you never can tell. "
77,"MEL: You don't happen to know another planet with a swimming pool, do"
78,you? 
79,DOCTOR: Why did I have to jettison the pool from the Tardis? 
80,"MEL: Well, it was leaking. "
81, [Fountain of Happiness Square]
82,
83, (They move into a larger area with hanging foliage
84,"and statues, and a very battered vending machine.) "
85,DOCTOR: There is a rather spectacular swimming pool on the planet
86,"Griophos, I understand. "
87,"MEL: Oh, we could try there. "
88,DOCTOR: Just one snag. 
89,MEL: What's that? 
90,DOCTOR: It's for the exclusive use of the Gulmaris. 
91,MEL: Who are they? 
92,"DOCTOR: A rather nasty breed of flesh eating octopi. Personally, I'd"
93,rather stay here and explore. I wonder what happened? 
94,"MEL: It's seen better days, that's what's happened. Still, now that"
95,"we're here, I suppose I might as well see what the pool's like. "
96,"DOCTOR: That's the spirit, Mel. This could be fascinating. Are you"
97,coming? 
98,"MEL: Yes, but one thing, Doctor. If anything goes wrong and we get"
99,"separated, we'll meet at the pool, all right? "
100,"DOCTOR: Oh, very well. But we've only just arrived. There's no need to"
101,start worrying yet. 
102,(An crossbow bolt thuds into the wall between them.)
103,
104, [Potassium Street]
105,
106," (In a darkened passageway, a young man in black"
107,uniform speaks into a walkie-talkie.) 
108,345/12: Caretaker number three four five stroke twelve subsection three
109,"reporting. I am proceeding along Potassium Street, corridor five six"
110,"seven three, section two oh one, opposite door seven eight two on floor"
111,"thirty five, north side. Over. "
112,(The nasal voice of a total jobsworth answers him.) 
113,CARETAKER : This is the Chief Caretaker speaking. We are receiving
114,"you, Caretaker number three four five stroke twelve subsection three."
115,Make your report. 
116,345/12: Considerable evidence of multi-coloured wall-scrawl all along
117,this part of street. Wall Scrawlers obviously active here. Over. 
118,CARETAKER : Report noted. Proceed now to report on corridor five
119,"six seven three, section three oh one. "
120,"345/12: Very good, Chief. "
121,(The young man walks along the street until his foot touches a piece of
122,ragged cloth. He picks it up and report in.) 
123,345/12: Caretaker number three four five stroke twelve subsection three
124,"reporting. I, I "
125,"CARETAKER : Chief Caretaker speaking. We are receiving you,"
126,Caretaker number three four five stroke twelve subsection three. You
127,are to proceed to section three oh one. What's the matter? 
128,"345/12: I, I'm scared, Chief."
129,
130, [Fountain of Happiness Square]
131,
132, (Mel and the Doctor are surrounded by young women
133,with dyed red hair to match their clothes. They all have small
134,crossbows.) 
135,DOCTOR: At least tell us who you are. 
136,BIN LINER: We're the Kangs. 
137,FIRE ESCAPE: Red Kangs. Red Kangs are best. Who's best? 
138,"RED KANGS: Red Kangs, Red Kangs, Red Kangs are best. "
139,"BIN LINER: So, who's best? "
140,"DOCTOR: The Red Kangs, I gather. There are other colour Kangs? "
141,"BIN LINER: Yeah, the Blue Kangs but they're "
142,RED KANGS: Cowardly Cutlets. 
143,"FIRE ESCAPE: And the Yellows, but they're only one now. "
144,DOCTOR: Why is that? 
145,BIN LINER: Just is. 
146,"DOCTOR: Not got very enquiring minds, have you? "
147,"MEL: Quiet, Doctor. "
148,BIN LINER: Are you a Blue Kang? 
149,(Mel is wearing a mostly blue spotted outfit.) 
150,"MEL: No. No, I'm not a Kang. I'm Mel. I don't know what the Kangs are. "
151,FIRE ESCAPE: We're the Kangs. Red Kangs. 
152,"DOCTOR: Who are, of course, the best. They seem to be some sort of"
153,"gang. All girls, by the looks of it. Perhaps they'll ask you to join"
154,"up, Mel. "
155,MEL: I hope not. 
156,BIN LINER: Bin liner. 
157,DOCTOR: Pardon? 
158,BIN LINER: Bin Liner. Mel. Bin Liner. 
159,"DOCTOR: Ah, now we're getting somewhere. I'm the Doctor. "
160,FIRE ESCAPE: Fire Escape. 
161,DOCTOR: How do you do. 
162,(The Kangs block the Doctor as he tries to shake hands.) 
163,DOCTOR: I was only trying to be friendly. 
164,BIN LINER: Friendly? 
165,DOCTOR: Say hello. Hello? Hello? 
166,"FIRE ESCAPE: Ah, he wants to how you do. Do we? "
167,"(She steps forward and raises her right hand in a fist, opens it and"
168,"pulls it down with her left hand, then repeats with the other hand."
169,"Finally she claps her hands and opens them out, palms towards the"
170,Doctor. He puts his palms on hers. Fire Escape steps back and the Red
171,Kangs all give a little curtsey and nod. The Doctor goes through the
172,routine then rolls his hat down his arm and back up onto his head. The
173,girls curtsey again.) 
174,"DOCTOR: You don't have to do that. What about Mel, then? "
175,(The Red Kangs fold their arms and turn away.) 
176,DOCTOR: What's the matter? 
177,(Fire Escape goes up to Mel then turns her back.) 
178,"FIRE ESCAPE: You we like, Doctor. What you wear is high fabsion and ice"
179,"hot, for an old one. "
180,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you very much. But clothes don't maketh the man, you"
181,know. 
182,"BIN LINER: No, but Kangs all have colours. Blue, yellow, red. What is"
183,Mel's colour? 
184,"MEL: Oh, I don't have a colour. And I don't want to be a Kang. "
185,FIRE ESCAPE: We don't want you to be a Kang. Not a Red Kang.
186,
187, [Corridor 5673] 
188, (The young Caretaker reports in again.) 
189,345/12: Caretaker number three four five stroke twelve subsection
190,twelve here. I am proceeding along corridor five six seven three
191,"towards section three oh one on floor thirty four, north side. Chief? "
192,CARETAKER : What is it now? 
193,345/12: Do I have to? 
194,"CARETAKER : Orders are orders. Number one rule of the Caretakers,"
195,Caretaker number three four five stroke twelve subsection three. 
196,"(As 345/12 goes round the corner, a young woman in blue comes out of"
197,hiding behind him. The young man's voice gets fainter as he walks
198,away.) 
199,"345/12 : Chief, listen. Something's going wrong. I know it's going"
200,"wrong. After (unintelligible), can't I just "
201,"CARETAKER : No, Caretaker number three four five stroke twelve"
202,"subsection three, you can't. "
203,"345/12 : But, Chief. "
204,"CARETAKER : Orders are orders. Number one rule of the Caretakers,"
205,Caretaker number three four five stroke twelve subsection three. 
206,"(Once he is out of earshot, the Blue Kang picks up an internal"
207,telephone and dials.) 
208,BLUE KANG: Yellow Kang the last believed unalive. Reason not known. 
209,(She puts the phone back and leaves in the opposite direction to the
210,young Caretaker. 
211,"Elsewhere, the real life item depicted in the stencil the Doctor saw on"
212,"the wall is trundling along, vicious screwthread for one arm, circular"
213,saw for the other. It is towing a large rubbish bin with a foot
214,sticking out of it. The last Yellow Kang has been cleaned up.)
215,
216,[Fountain of Happiness Square]
217,
218,(The Doctor is at the centre of a dancing group.) 
219,"RED KANGS: Red Kangs, Red Kangs, Red Kangs are best. Red Kangs, Red"
220,"Kangs, Red Kangs are best. Red Kangs, Red Kangs, Red Kangs are best. "
221,"DOCTOR: Red Kangs are best. Yes, well, now, that we've been introduced,"
222,I think that some explanations are in order. We're visitors to Paradise
223,"Towers, only just arrived, so you can't really expect Mel to understand"
224,what you're talking about. 
225,BIN LINER: No visitors. 
226,DOCTOR: Pardon? 
227,"BIN LINER: No visitors, no ball games, no fly posts, no visitors. "
228,DOCTOR: You mean visitors aren't allowed? 
229,BIN LINER: No visitors ever. 
230,FIRE ESCAPE: Not since time start. 
231,"DOCTOR: There's always a first time. I mean, not everyone you're going"
232,to meet's going to be a Kang. 
233,"FIRE ESCAPE: No, there are Old Ones, and the Caretakers and the "
234,BIN LINER: Raita! 
235,DOCTOR: And? 
236,BIN LINER: That is all. 
237,"DOCTOR: I see. And who are these, er, Caretakers? "
238,"BIN LINER: They wipe away our wallscrawl, chase us down Carrydoors,"
239,catch us if they can. 
240,DOCTOR: I see. And all the young ones are Kangs. 
241,FIRE ESCAPE: Yes. 
242,"DOCTOR: Or girls, I should say. There don't seem to be any boys. "
243,(The Doctor nods towards the Tardis. Mel takes the hint.) 
244,"FIRE ESCAPE: Boys? Boys? What are boys? There are Old Ones, and the"
245,Caretakers and Kangs and the (Bin Liner gives her a Look). That is all.
246,
247,"DOCTOR: I see. Well, I must say it's been nice meeting you, but I think"
248,"it's time we ought to be on our way> Don't you think so, Mel? "
249,"MEL: Yes, Doctor. Not a moment to lose. "
250,(The Red Kangs surround them again.) 
251,BIN LINER: We heard you talk of the pool. 
252,FIRE ESCAPE: The Great Pool in the Sky. 
253,"DOCTOR: Did you? Oh, I expect your ears were playing tricks on you. "
254,BIN LINER: You're coming with us to our hide-in. 
255,(They tie Mel and the Doctor's hands behind their backs.) 
256,DOCTOR: I wonder if Blue Kangs behave like this.
257,
258, [Floor 34 North]
259,
260," 345/12: As instructed, I'm proceeding along"
261,corridor 
262,(A burst of noise comes from his walkie-talkie.) 
263,345/12: Chief? Chief? Are you receiving me? Chief! 
264,(The Robot Cleaner comes round the far corner.) 
265,"345/12: No. No, it can't be. The Chief told us. "
266,(A second one approaches him from the rear.) 
267,345/12 Chief! 
268,"CARETAKER : Yes, Caretaker number three four five stroke twelve"
269,subsection three. 
270,"345/12: Oh, thank goodness you're there, Chief. "
271,"CARETAKER : Now don't panic, Caretaker number three four five"
272,stroke twelve subsection three. 
273,"345/12: Chief, it's, it's "
274,(The second Cleaner touches his back. He turns and is grabbed by the
275,throat.) 
276,345/12: Argh! 
277,"CARETAKER : Yes, I know."
278,
279, [Fountain of Happiness Square]
280,
281, DOCTOR: The art of knot tying hasn't died out
282,"here, anyway. "
283,MEL: I thought they liked you. 
284,"DOCTOR: They liked my clothes, which is clearly not enough. "
285,BIN LINER: Are they tied and true? 
286,RED KANG: Yes. 
287,"BIN LINER: Ready, Fire Escape. "
288,(Fire Escape is using a telephone.) 
289,"FIRE ESCAPE: Red Kang I-spy says we can't go through usual carrydoor,"
290,Blue Kangs out and lurking. 
291,BIN LINER: And the Yellow? 
292,FIRE ESCAPE: No Yellows. All unalive now. 
293,BIN LINER: All? 
294,FIRE ESCAPE: All. 
295,DOCTOR: Excuse me. 
296,FIRE ESCAPE: What? 
297,"DOCTOR: Did you say a whole tribe of Yellow Kangs have been wiped out,"
298,"I mean, made unalive, just like that? But why? You didn't kill them,"
299,did you? 
300,FIRE ESCAPE: To make unalive is not part of the Kang way. No ball
301,"games, no fly posts, no wipe-outs. "
302,"DOCTOR: Who did it, then? The Caretakers? The Blue Kangs? I mean, who? "
303,FIRE ESCAPE: It takes place. 
304,BIN LINER: Come on. We've been in the open spaces too long. We must go.
305,Ware Blue Kangs. Build high for happiness. 
306,RED KANGS: Build high for happiness.
307,
308, [Caretaker Headquarters]
309,
310,(The Caretaker is watching the cleaners on the wall
311,screen.) 
312,"CARETAKER : A nice little snack coming up for you, my beauty, so"
313,you'll grow up big and strong. That's Daddy's little pet. 
314,"DEPUTY : I've located a whole group of them, Chief. Large as life,"
315,twice as nasty. 
316,CARETAKER : Excellent. Attention all Caretakers. Abandon further
317,"work on master plan QYT, and as set out in regulation book One Four"
318,Five proceed instead into Standard Emergency Plan nine oh eight B. 
319,DEPUTY : Emergency plan nine oh eight B. Certainly. 
320,CARETAKER : That is correct. Seize all Red Wall-Scrawlers in
321,Fountain of Happiness square. Now!
322,
323, [Staircase]
324,
325," DOCTOR: Sorry about the pool, Mel. "
326,"MEL: That's all right, Doctor. "
327,(Caretakers approach them from the front. The Kangs retreat.) 
328,"DEPUTY: All right, you Wall Scrawlers. Let's be having you. "
329,(The Doctor falls at the bottom of the stairs. Mel runs with the
330,Kangs.)
331,
332,[Fountain of Happiness Square]
333,
334, DEPUTY: Who are you? 
335,DOCTOR: That doesn't matter. Are you the Caretakers? 
336,DEPUTY: Yes. 
337,"DOCTOR: And you take care. Of people, that is. "
338,DEPUTY: Maybe. 
339,"DOCTOR: You seem to be our best bet so far, don't you think so, Mel?"
340,Mel? Where's Mel? 
341,"DEPUTY: No, no, no, sunbeam. You're coming with us."
342,
343, [Corridor]
344,
345,(Mel stops and the Kangs run on.) 
346,"MEL: Doctor? Doctor? Doctor? Oh, damn it. What now? "
347,(A woman in pink comes out of apartment 1236.) 
348,TILDA: Cooee. Cooooeeee. Would you care for a cup of tea? 
349,MEL: Hello. 
350,"TILDA: I said, would you like a cup of tea and some cakes? "
351,"MEL: Yes, thank you."
352,
353, [Tilda and Tabby's home]
354,
355," (Inside, a large woman in blue bustles about.) "
356,"TABBY: Is she coming, Tilda? "
357,TILDA: Yes. 
358,TABBY: How does she look? 
359,TILDA: Very nice. 
360,TABBY: Ooo. Is she fat? 
361,"TILDA: Shush, shush. Oh, she's nearly here, dear. Oh, my goodness,"
362,Tabby. Look at that table. Quick.
363,
364, [Outside Tilda and Tabby's home]
365,
366, MEL: Hello. 
367,"TILDA: My friend Tabby is just tidying up. We're both very house proud,"
368,"you see. Particularly when we have guests. Yes, I think it's all right"
369,to go in now. 
370, [Tilda and Tabby's home]
371,
372," TILDA: Come in, dear. I'm Tilda, by the way."
373,What's you name? 
374,MEL: Mel. 
375,"TILDA: Oh! Mel. Mel. What a delicious name. Tabby, this is Mel. "
376,MEL: Hello. 
377,"TABBY: Hello, dear. Come in and make yourself comfortable. "
378,MEL: Thank you. 
379,"(Mel walks past the ladies, and they notice that her hands are bound.) "
380,"TABBY: Ohm look at your poor hands. We can't allow that, can we, Tilda?"
381,
382,"TILDA: Of course not. Sit down, dear. Let Tabby untie you. I'll put the"
383,kettle on. 
384,"TABBY: Sit down, dear. Oh, you must have been having a horrid time. You"
385,poor girl. Who did this to you? 
386,MEL: The Kangs. The Red Kangs. 
387,"TABBY: Oh, those Kangs, they're naughty girls. You're not a Kang are"
388,you? 
389,"MEL: Oh, no. "
390,"TILDA: No, we didn't think you were somehow. They're nasty, untrusting"
391,"girls, who would never take a cup of tea from two harmless old folks"
392,"like us, would they, Tabby. "
393,"TABBY: Oh no, dear, no. There you are. "
394,"MEL: Oh, thank you. "
395,"TABBY: Oh, Mel's not at all like a Kang. She's a nice, polite, clean,"
396,well spoken girl. Just the sort we like. 
397,MEL: Excuse me. 
398,"TABBY: There you are, Tilda, what did I say. Lovely manners, saying"
399,"excuse me before asking a question. What was it, dear? "
400,"MEL: I was just going to ask who you were. I mean, like the Kangs are"
401,"the Kangs, and the Caretakers are "
402,"TILDA: Oh, silly, us. We're the Rezzies. (Tilda puts a tray on the"
403,coffee table.) 
404,MEL: The Rezzies? 
405,"TABBY: Yes, well, we're some of the Rezzies, anyway. We have a few"
406,like-minded friends here and there in the Towers. 
407,MEL: Have you always lived here? 
408,"TILDA: Oh, we've been here for ever such a long time, if that's what"
409,you mean. How about you? 
410,"MEL: Oh, I'm just visiting. "
411,"TABBY: A visitor. Well, well. Must be a long time since the Towers saw"
412,"any of those, eh, Tilda? "
413,"TILDA: Takes you back, doesn't it. "
414,MEL: Does it? What was it like before? 
415,"TILDA: Oh, never mind about that, dear. Have some tea and cakes. "
416,"TABBY: Oh, yes. "
417,"MEL: Thanks, I'm really hungry. "
418,"TABBY: Yes. You're a thin little thing, aren't you? Oh, but never mind,"
419,dear. Tilda and I will feed you up. 
420,(Tilda spoons lots of sugar into Mel's cup while Tabby holds out a
421,plate of massive chocolate chip cookies.)
422,
423, [Corridor]
424,
425, DOCTOR: Well? 
426,DEPUTY: You're allowed to stop one and a half minutes for every three
427,thousand steps walked. 
428,DOCTOR: And that means? 
429,DEPUTY: You can stand still for a while. 
430,"DOCTOR: Oh, very generous of you. It must be a job trying to keep these"
431,corridors clean and tidy like this. 
432,"DEPUTY: Oh yes, especially the wallscrawl. "
433,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's what you call them. Wallscrawlers. "
434,"DEPUTY: Yes. Dirty pests. Well, look at it. "
435,"DOCTOR: By my two tickers, what's that? "
436,DEPUTY: What's what? 
437,(The Doctor goes over to a piece of graffito.) 
438,"DOCTOR: It looks like a Kang, and something attacking her. Some sort of"
439,"claw. Oh here, there's a drill and down here there's a nozzle sucking"
440,things up. 
441,"DEPUTY: Yes, well, the Wallscrawlers make up a lot of silly pictures. "
442,DOCTOR: Let's hope they're just silly pictures. What's that? 
443,"DEPUTY: I don't hear anything. Look, sunbeam, if there was anything"
444,"wrong, there'd be instructions in here about how to deal with it,"
445,wouldn't there? Hmm? 
446,(A Robotic cleaner comes round the corner behind them.) 
447,"DOCTOR: Oh, I see. It's some sort of robotic cleaner with automotive"
448,bicurval scraping blades. Impressive workmanship. 
449,DEPUTY: You don't understand. 
450,"DOCTOR: No, I don't, but I intend to. Now, let's have a look at this"
451,"automotive blades, shall we? Ah, yes. "
452,(The Robot cleaner extends its central arm to reveal the claw as
453,depicted in the graffito.) 
454,DOCTOR: Do you usually do what I usually do in these circumstances? 
455,DEPUTY: What's that? 
456,DOCTOR: Run!

461,knitting.) 
462,"TILDA: Of course, in the old days things were very different, weren't"
463,"they, Tabby. "
464,"TABBY: Oh, very different, Tilda. "
465,MEL: So what happened? 
466,"TABBY: Well, my memory's not what it was, but one thing followed"
467,"another and before we knew where we were, we were in the pickle we are"
468,today. 
469,"TILDA: Now everybody has to fend for themselves, take what they can"
470,"find. Have another cake, Mel dear. Go on. "
471,"MEL: All right, then. So you were here from the beginning then? "
472,"TABBY: Oh yes, dear, yes. Ever since the Great architect finished"
473,Paradise Towers and all the youngsters and all the oldsters were moved
474,here. 
475,"MEL: And the rest, the in-betweens? "
476,"TABBY: Oh, well, I don't quite recall, but I think they had some else"
477,to do. A war to fight or something. All such a long time ago. I often
478,wonder whether we won that war or not. 
479,"TILDA: I don't suppose we'll ever know now, Tabby. "
480,"TABBY: No, I don't suppose we will, Tilda. "
481,MEL: Do you know anything about a swimming pool? 
482,"TILDA: A swimming pool? No, I don't think so. I've never heard of one."
483,"Have you, Tabby? "
484,"TABBY: No, I haven't, Tilda. No. Oh, you'd be far better off to stay"
485,"here with us. Wouldn't she, Tilda? "
486,"TILDA: Oh yes, Tabby. She can eat and eat till her heart's content and"
487,"get nice and plump and healthy, safe from those nasty Kangs. "
488,"MEL: It is very kind of you both, but I'm afraid I will have to go once"
489,I've finished my tea. It's very important. 
490,"TILDA: Oh, nonsense. There's no rush, dear. Finish your cake. "
491,"TABBY: No, we'll be very offended if you rush off so quickly. Won't we,"
492,Tilda? 
493,"MEL: Well, just a few more minutes, maybe. "
494,"TILDA: That's it, dear. There's plenty of time. "
495,TABBY: All the time in the world. Make the most of the peace and quiet.
496,(There is a loud knock at the door which makes them all jump. A young
497,man batters his way in and produces a hand gun.) 
498,PEX: Are these old ladies annoying you? 
499,MEL: No! 
500,PEX: Are you annoying these old ladies? 
501,"TILDA + TABBY: No, she isn't. "
502,PEX: Oh. 
503,(He lowers his gun.) 
504,TILDA: And I do wish you would stop breaking through our door to try
505,and save us. 
506,"TABBY: That's the third time we've had it repaired, and it's not though"
507,if we've ever been in any trouble. 
508,TILDA: Apart from bits of door flying about all over the place. 
509,"MEL: Look, who exactly are you? "
510,PEX: The name is Pex. I put the world of Paradise Towers to rights.

515,DOCTOR: But I thought you said the lifts here don't work?

521,avail.) 
522,"DOCTOR: Here, let me. "
523,(The Doctor thumps the buttons with his umbrella. The doors close.) 
524,DOCTOR: Going up?
525,
526, [Tilda and Tabby's home]
527,
528,(Pex is trying to mend the front door.) 
529,"MEL: No, I really do have to go but you have been ever so kind. "
530,"TILDA: Oh, it does seem a pity when we were so comfortable. "
531,TABBY: You mustn't be put off by him. 
532,"MEL: Oh, I wasn't. Don't you worry. But I really must find my friend"
533,and the pool. 
534,"TILDA: You will come and see us again, won't you, dear? "
535,TABBY: Maybe bring your friend. 
536,MEL: Of course. Thank you for everything. 
537,"TILDA: Till next time, dear. "
538,"TABBY: Well, we'll be looking out for you, dear. "
539,"MEL: Yes, bye. "
540,(Mel leaves through the hole in the door.) 
541,"TABBY: Would you mind going now too, please?"

543, [Outside Tilda and Tabby's home]
544,
545, PEX: Just a minute. 
546,MEL: What is it now? 
547,PEX: You're going on a dangerous journey. 
548,MEL: So? 
549,PEX: You need me to protect you. 
550,MEL: I most certainly do not. 
551,PEX: But that's my job. I am Pex. I put the world of Paradise Towers to
552,rights. 
553,"MEL: Yes, I know all that, but I still don't need you. "
554,"PEX: Well if you don't need a protector, then you might need a guide."
555,Somebody who knows their way about. 
556,MEL: All right. I may live to regret this.

586,DOCTOR: Greetings. 
587,CARETAKER: I am the Chief Caretaker. 
588,DOCTOR: And I am 
589,CARETAKER: No need to tell me. I know who you are. We have been waiting
590,for this momentous visit for so many years. You are the man who brought
591,Paradise Towers to life. The visionary who dreamed up its pools and
592,lifts and squares. And now you have returned to your creation. You will
593,make all those dilapidated lifts and rise and fall as they've never
594,done before. All signs of wallscrawl will disappear from the corridors
595,"of Paradise Towers. The floors will gleam and the windows will shine,"
596,"and will be made as new. Fellow Caretakers, do you know who this is?"
597,This is the Great Architect returned to Paradise Towers. Bid him
598,"welcome. All Hail the Great Architect, all hail. "
599,CARETAKERS: All hail the Great Architect. 
600,"DEPUTY: What shall we do with him now then, Chief? "
601,CARETAKER: Kill him.

607,CARETAKER: Why? 
608,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm not the Great Architect. I'm the Doctor. "
609,"CARETAKER: Oh, the Doctor now, is it? He always was an artful one, the"
610,"Great Architect. Make the preparations will you, Deputy? "
611,"DEPUTY: Very good, Chief. "
612,"DOCTOR: You can't condemn me without trial, without evidence, without"
613,"proof. I mean, I don't even know who this Great Architect is. "
614,"CARETAKER: The three two seven appendix three subsection nine death, I"
615,think. 
616,"DEPUTY: Three two. Very good, Chief. "
617,(The communications panel trills.) 
618,"CARETAKER: Oh, that would happen just now. Yes? Oh dear, oh dear. Poor"
619,"Caretaker number three four five stroke twelve subsection three. What,"
620,"now? Yes, all right, all right, there's no need to quote the rule book"
621,"at me, Caretaker number five seven nine stroke fourteen subsection"
622,eight. I'll come. 
623,DOCTOR: Anything the matter? 
624,"CARETAKER: Nothing that isn't under control, thank you, Great"
625,Architect. An unfortunate accident has happened to Caretaker number
626,three four five. I am required by the rulebook to go and investigate.
627,The three two seven appendix three subsection nine death will be
628,"postponed till I return. In the meantime, you will guard the Great"
629,Architect here with your lives. Understand?

637,MEL: I'm in a hurry. You know that. And that ceremony in the square
638,gave me the creeps. 
639,PEX: It won't take a moment. 
640,(Pex pulls a lighting unit from the wall and bends its metal support.) 
641,MEL: Well?

644,PEX: Practice martial arts.

646,PEX: Run the length of seventy

648,"came from, it might be more use. But you can't, can you. "
649,"PEX: Well, that's not my job. I'm Pex. "
650,"MEL: I know, and you're here to put the world of Paradise Towers to"

662,RED KANGS: Build high for happiness. 
663,FIRE ESCAPE: All sound and safe? 
664,BIN LINER: The un-young Doctor and the girl who isn't a Kang are lost
665,for now. 
666,FIRE ESCAPE: And No Exit? 
667,BIN LINER: No Exit's not here. 
668,FIRE ESCAPE: Where is she? 
669,BIN LINER: Was on Talkyphone three before Caretakers attacked. 
670,FIRE ESCAPE: Not now? Mayhaps No Exit's returned to Red Kang
671,Headquarters. 
672,BIN LINER: Mayhaps or 
673,FIRE ESCAPE: Or? 
674,BIN LINER: No Exit's unalive. 
675,FIRE ESCAPE: Taken to the cleaners? 
676,"BIN LINER: Yes, taken to the cleaners. "
677,"(Somewhere in the basement of the Towers, the Cleaner with the Yellow"
678,Kang in it's rubbish bin trundles up to a No Entry door which slides up
679,for it and into an area filled with red hot air and steam.

681,[Caretaker Headquarters]
682,
683, DOCTOR: Shall I tell you what puzzles me most?
684,"Those cleaners we had so much trouble with. Well, presumably they're"
685,part of the organisation of Paradise Towers like your Caretakers. So
686,why should they attack you? 
687,(Neither the Deputy or the other Caretaker guarding him answer.) 
688,DOCTOR: And another thing. I don't know why you're so keen to kill off
689,the Great Architect. I thought you'd be delighted to have him here to
690,put things to rights. It doesn't make sense. Does it? (silence) I'd
691,hate to have to live my life by some boring old rulebook like you do.
692,"You must get fed up. Well, do you? "
693,DEPUTY: No. 
694,DOCTOR: Never? 
695,DEPUTY: Never. 
696,DOCTOR: I suppose how you guard me is in that rulebook. 
697,DEPUTY: Yes. Rule forty five B stroke two subsection five. 
698,"DOCTOR: I wouldn't mind having a look at that rulebook, if that's not"
699,"against the rules. I mean, after all, I am a condemned man. "
700,DEPUTY: Hmm. 
701,(The Deputy consults the rule book.) 
702,"DEPUTY: Yes, we can count that as your last request. You're entitled to"
703,one if you're to undergo a three two seven appendix three subsection
704,nine death. Not a pretty way to go. 
705,(The Deputy passes over the rule book and the Doctor leafs through it.)
706,
707,"DOCTOR: How extraordinary. No, no. It can't be true. "
708,DEPUTY: What's that? 
709,"DOCTOR: Oh no, no. It's. You couldn't possibly. "
710,"DEPUTY: If it's there, it's true. Rules are rules. Orders are orders. "
711,DOCTOR: If you say so. I don't want to make a fool of you. 
712,DEPUTY: Read out what it says. 
713,"DOCTOR: Oh, very well, but I find it hard to credit "
714,DEPUTY: Read it! 
715,DOCTOR: It says here about a three two seven appendix three subsection
716,"nine death, that after you've been guarding the condemned prisoner for"
717,"(checks his wristwatch) thirty five minutes, you must all stand up. "
718,DEPUTY: But if we 
719,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know, I know, I find it extraordinary. I don't really"
720,expect you to do it. But it is in there. 
721,(The Deputy and the Caretaker stand up.) 
722,DOCTOR: The Caretakers present must then move five paces away from the
723,prisoner. 
724,(They do so.) 
725,DOCTOR: Five. Close their eyes and put their hands above their head. 
726,(The Doctor tiptoes up to the back of the Deputy and carefully picks
727,"his trouser pocket, removing his wallet containing a selection of"
728,cards.) 
729,DEPUTY: How long do we do this for? 
730,"DOCTOR: For about a minute and a half. You see, that's how long the"
731,prisoner needs. 
732,(The Doctor takes his umbrella from the Caretaker.) 
733,DEPUTY: To do what? 
734,DOCTOR: Find the key card to the door and escape. 
735,DEPUTY: Sorry? 
736,DOCTOR: Find the key card to the door and escape. 
737,(The second one works.) 
738,DEPUTY: Rules should always make sense. Why should we allow a prisoner 
739,(He turns to see the door open slightly as the Doctor pulls his
740,umbrella free.)

752,(Mel and Pex come out on the catwalk over the
753,Square.) 
754,MEL: Oh no. We're back at the Square again. 
755,PEX: I've been trying to confuse anyone who might be following us. It's
756,part of the training. 
757,MEL: Does your training include confusing yourself at the same time. 
758,PEX: I'm not confused. 
759,MEL: So you know where to go next to get us up to the pool then? 
760,PEX: Of course. 
761,(Mel goes down to the Square proper.) 
762,MEL: Well then? 
763,PEX: We go that way. 
764,MEL: You sure? 
765,PEX: Of course I'm sure. 
766,"MEL: Pex, can I ask you something? "
767,PEX: What? 
768,MEL: Why are you here? 
769,PEX: What do you mean? 
770,"MEL: Well, there's no one else like you here, is there? "
771,PEX: You can say that again. Shall I show you how 
772,MEL: No! I think you've wrecked quite enough for one day. Tabby and
773,Tilda talked about a war. They said that only the Oldsters and the
774,"Youngsters were brought to the Paradise Towers and the rest, the"
775,"In-betweens, were sent off to fight and never came back. So how does it"
776,happen that you're here? 
777,PEX: Isn't it obvious? 
778,"MEL: No, it isn't obvious at all. Pex, you say you want to help me get"
779,"up to the pool and find my friend the Doctor, so I have to know. "
780,PEX: I was sent here. The power to protect has been invested in me. 
781,MEL: Who by? 
782,PEX: By those who I am not allowed to name. 
783,"MEL: And that's the truth? Really, the truth? Then I have to believe"
784,you. It can't be safe hanging round this Square any longer. 
785,PEX: You're in no danger with me around. 
786,MEL: Are you sure? 
787,PEX: Of course I'm sure. Come on. We go this way.

796,walkie-talkie.) 
797,"CARETAKER: Now the main thing, fellow Caretakers, is not to panic. Just"
798,because it appears that something unfortunate may have happened to
799,"Caretaker number three four five stroke twelve subsection three, we"
800,must not go leaping to conclusions. Careless chat about the Robotic
801,Self-activating Megapodic mark seven Z Cleaners having got out of
802,"control is not going to help anyone, and may needlessly upset other"
803,Caretakers. Many explanations are possible for this unlucky accident.

805,before. I'm sure you will be quite safe.

820,"TILDA: Well, I'm sure we could both have done with a little more."

910,"mean, what is behind that door belching out smoke that you Kangs are so"
911,"keen on painting pictures of, eh? Any ideas? Or is that simply just"
912,another mystery? 
913,BIN LINER: Cleaners were in the carrydoor with sprinkle gas. There no
914,more. 
915,DOCTOR: Thank goodness for that. Can I have a look? 
916,(The Doctor goes to the telephone.) 
917,"DOCTOR: You know, you really are very stupid for such clever people. If"
918,I were you I'd find that door and discover what's behind it. Because
919,"until you do, we're all at risk, You, Me, Mel, everybody. Are these"
920,antiques dotted around all over the building? It really is a splendid
921,piece of auditoryarchitectatonicalmetrasyncocity. 
922,FIRE ESCAPE: It works! 
923,DOCTOR: I'm sure. 
924,(Bin Liner takes the handset from the Doctor and taps in three numbers
925,then gives it back.) 
926,DOCTOR: Hello? Sorry. Wrong number. Just one other thing. You probably
927,haven't realised that this machine has another purpose. 
928,(He swings it around to reveal it is a Fizzade drinks dispenser.) 
929,"DOCTOR: Oh incidentally, yet another Paradise Towers mystery. Issued by"
930,"the Great Architect, Kroagnon. Kroagnon? I do wish I could place him. I"
931,"mean, what's happened to him since he's finished this building. No one"
932,seems to know. Sorry. 
933,(The Doctor goes to put a coin in the slot and Bin Liner raises her
934,crossbow. The Doctor knocks it down with his umbrella. The coin goes
935,"in, there is a lot of whirring then a can of drink drops to the bottom."
936,The Doctor pulls the ring-pull and the girls scatter. He takes a
937,drink.) 
938,"DOCTOR: Oh, very refreshing. "
939,(Bin Liner takes a drink herself then passes it to Fire Escape.)

947,Caretaker? 
948,(A pair of florescent tubes shaped like eyes stare back at him.) 
949,VOICE: Hungry! 
950,CARETAKER: Hungry? You can't be. Daddy's always made sure you get a
951,good supply of what you need. Daddy's the Chief Caretaker. That's his
952,main job. 
953,VOICE: Hungry! 
954,"CARETAKER: And why we're on the subject, Daddy's not too pleased with"
955,"you. Now I didn't send you this little snack, did I? So how come it's"
956,got here? I mean the Cleaners wouldn't do things like that without
957,"orders from someone and it wasn't me, so who was it? Now tell Daddy. If"
958,"you don't tell Daddy who's been feeding you behind his back, I won't"
959,give you the Great Architect to eat. 
960,VOICE: Hungry! 
961,"CARETAKER: All right, all right, all right. You'll get him just as soon"
962,as I can catch him again. 
963,VOICE: Hungry! 
964,"CARETAKER: But my pet, my darling, I don't understand. You're not"

972,BLUE KANG: We saw you with the Red Kangs. 
973,"MEL: Oh, but they were holding me captive, too. Look, my name's Mel."
974,I'm a visitor here. 
975,BLUE KANG: You know him? 
976,PEX: I'm protecting her. 
977,MEL: Do you know anything about this person? 
978,BLUE KANG: All Kangs know the muscle brain. He's a scaredy-cat. When
979,"the In-Betweens sent us all here in the ship, us and the Oldsters, the"
980,muscle brain hid away and came with us because he didn't want to fight
981,in the war along with the other In-Betweens. 
982,PEX: Who told you that? 
983,BLUE KANG: Everyone knows that. The Oldsters call out after him in the
984,Carrydoors. The muscle brain's a Scaredy-cat. 
985,"BLUE KANGS: Scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat! "
986,MEL: Pex? 
987,PEX: What? 
988,MEL: Is this true? Is this true? 
989,PEX: I've made up for it since I was here. Since I've been in Paradise

991,MEL: Sent by powers that you weren't allowed to name? I should have
992,guessed. Will you allow me to go if I go alone? I give you my word I

994,"Goodbye, Pex. "

1010,"DEPUTY: What's that, Chief? "
1011,"CARETAKER: The Wallscrawlers. They've been getting very bold of late,"

1014,"DEPUTY: Yes, Chief. "
1015,CARETAKER: The three two seven appendix three subsection nine death of

1049,"FIRE ESCAPE: Ware, Doctor! He brings them here because like Caretakers"
1050,he wants all Wallscrawlers unalive! 
1051,"DOCTOR: Not at all. You don't understand. I mean, the last people I"
1052,"want to meet are the Caretakers. I'm in as much danger as you. More,"
1053,"probably. You got to believe me. Listen, we've got to work together."
1054,"The Chief Caretaker's off his head. If we don't stop the wipe-outs, who"

1076,"TABBY: We don't see this as a matter for humour, Mel dear. We mean"
1077,every word.

1079,over Mel's face.)

1105,"then, no joke was intended. "

1113,MEL: There's something wrong with the waste disposal unit. 
1114,"TABBY: No, don't talk nonsense, dear. It always makes that funny noise."

1139,"MEL: Don't just stand there, help me! Help! "
1140,(Pex is frozen as Tilda runs to the sink to get another knife. Then she
1141,gets grabbed by a Cleaner claw and dragged into the waste disposal
1142,too.)

1144,(Pex unties Mel.)

1182,a crocheted cover.) 
1183,PEX: What is it? 
1184,MEL: It's a map of the Paradise Towers. It occurred to me that when
1185,"everyone was brought here, they'd have been given a map to help them"
1186,get around.

1201,MEL: What now? 
1202,PEX: Only the unalive go there.

1204,PEX: Everybody. Bin Liner and Fire Escape. 
1205,MEL: Now that's odd. 
1206,PEX: What? 
1207,"MEL: Look, down here where it says Basement, and underneath, no plan"

1221,enormous amount of extra paper work.

1223,CARETAKER: Yes.

1227,CARETAKER: I'm well aware of that. 
1228,"DEPUTY: But Chief, if this goes on and the Cleaners are out of control,"
1229,how many of us are going to be left? 
1230,"CARETAKER: Deputy Chief Caretaker, by talking out of turn in such a"
1231,"way, you have just broken so many rules and regulations that it would"
1232,"take me several hours just to innumerate them. Wait outside, would you?"
1233,
1234,"DEPUTY: Yes, Chief. "
1235,(The Deputy leaves.)

1258,CARETAKER: Are you the Great Architect? 
1259,DOCTOR: You mean you're not certain anymore? 
1260,"CARETAKER: Oh, I shall have you killed anyway, but it would be"
1261,interesting to know. 
1262,DOCTOR: What makes you think I'm the Great Architect? Haven't you ever
1263,met him? 
1264,"CARETAKER: Just when Paradise Towers was being completed, before any of"
1265,"us got here, he disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Never been"
1266,seen since anywhere. 
1267,DOCTOR: How odd. 
1268,CARETAKER: Odd indeed for a being whose head was apparently full of
1269,extravagant future plans. But I always knew in my bones he'd turn up
1270,again one day. Start altering things just when I'd got them the way I
1271,wanted. 
1272,"DOCTOR: And that would justify killing me, I mean him? "
1273,"CARETAKER: Oh, yes. "
1274,DOCTOR: Like everyone else you seem terrified to face up to the reality
1275,"of what's happening in Paradise Towers. I mean, killing me won't help"
1276,you find out who's sending out those robotic Cleaners to kill people.
1277,"And that's a problem that isn't going to go away, unless, of course,"
1278,you're giving the orders yourself. 
1279,CARETAKER: What a ridiculous idea. 
1280,DOCTOR: Perhaps. But I do have a better one. 
1281,CARETAKER: And what is that? 
1282,DOCTOR: No doubt you've been allowing the Cleaners to kill off some of
1283,"your people as well as the Kangs, for reasons which are at the moment"
1284,beyond me but then I'm not a power crazed psychopath. 
1285,CARETAKER: What did you say? 
1286,"DOCTOR: Listen, you're going to kill me anyway so you may as well make"
1287,use of my brain. 
1288,(The Doctor makes the Caretaker sit.) 
1289,"DOCTOR: What I also think is happening is that, besides your"
1290,"activities, is that the Caretakers, the Kangs, Red, Yellow, Blue and"
1291,everyone else are being killed off without instructions from you. And
1292,that's why you're worried. You don't know who's doing it. 
1293,"CARETAKER: Oh, don't I? "
1294,(The Deputy and other Caretakers run.) 
1295,"DEPUTY: Report from floor one hundred and nine, Chief! Two of the"
1296,oldsters have apparently disappeared and it's believed they've gone
1297,down the XY three standard issue waste disposal unit. 
1298,CARETAKER: What? 
1299,"DEPUTY: It's unheard of, Chief. I should remind you that under"
1300,emergency regulation number three four eight stroke five subsection six
1301,
1302,"CARETAKER: All right, all right, all right. I'd better go and"
1303,"investigate this myself. Deputy, I leave you in charge. I don't need to"
1304,remind you of the consequences of second mistake. 
1305,"DEPUTY: No, Chief. "
1306,CARETAKER: No. Perhaps we should allow the Great Architect to see a
1307,copy of the Illustrated Prospectus of Paradise Towers. Might bring back
1308,happy memories for him. Not that I shall be away long. It's against my
1309,principles to keep anyone waiting.

1311,feet up on the console.)

1336,MEL: But I pressed the button 
1337,PEX: The Kangs play a game you see. They get into the lift and press
1338,the buttons for all kinds of floors up and down the building. 
1339,MEL: So we could be stuck in here going up and down for hours. 
1340,PEX: Yes.

1347,"NARRATOR: Welcome one and all to Paradise Towers, which will be your"
1348,new home for a good few years to come. Some of you will understandably
1349,feel nervous at leaving everything you know for a strange new

1351,experience you won't want to change it for any other. Our motto is
1352,Build High for Happiness.

1356,you can see from these pictures.) 
1357,(Bin Liner gives him the Kang greeting.) 
1358,"BIN LINER: How you do, Doctor. "
1359,"DOCTOR: How you do. Bin Liner, Fire Escape, how did you get here? "
1360,"FIRE ESCAPE: We track you down the Carrydoors, creep in when the Chief"
1361,Caretaker left and bundle up these others. 
1362,BIN LINER: Sorry to disturb you. 
1363,"DOCTOR: Not at all, I'm delighted to see you. Oh, whoops. "
1364,(The Doctor takes the Illustrated Prospectus disc from the console.) 
1365,"DOCTOR: I'm sure there are some rules to govern this, Deputy Chief. "

1373,"MADDY: Well, I can't think of any other explanation, can you? "
1374,"CARETAKER: Since you ask, thousands. "
1375,"MADDY: Well, it's never happened before. We Rezzies are all very"
1376,frightened. 
1377,"CARETAKER: Well, you have my assurance there is no cause for panic. "
1378,MADDY: No cause for panic. 
1379,CARETAKER: No. 
1380,MADDY: No cause for panic? 
1381,CARETAKER: No. 
1382,MADDY: Two of my next door neighbours have just disappeared down the
1383,waste disposal chute. I wouldn't wish that on anybody. 
1384,CARETAKER: I will conduct a full investigation on the matter and in due
1385,course a report will be issued to all residents. And you may rest
1386,assured there'll be no cover up. No cover up whatsoever. On the other
1387,"hand, I would urge you for the moment to keep the matter quiet. We"
1388,"don't want to alarm people unduly, do we? "
1389,"MADDY: Well, I'm not really sure I ought to. "
1390,CARETAKER: Not that I would wish to bribe you to hold your tongue in
1391,"anyway but rules can be made flexible, and it could be arranged for you"
1392,to move into this flat instead of your own. It is substantially larger.
1393,"And after all, what's the good of panicking people when I repeat"
1394,everything is under control. 
1395,"MADDY: Well, I'd hate to upset anybody. "
1396,CARETAKER: Exactly. And now if you'll excuse me I think I will depart

1405,PEX: What did you say? 
1406,"MEL: Oh, it doesn't matter really. It's just, it's just if the lift"
1407,gets completely stuck between floors 
1408,"(Floor 174, 173, 174.) "

1464,"DOCTOR: Kroagnon was a brilliant architect, and Miracle City, his"
1465,masterpiece. Only 
1466,BIN LINER: Only? 
1467,DOCTOR: Only he refused to move out and let anybody move in. He thought
1468,that people would destroy the beauty of his work. But they got him out.
1469,Only those who moved in lived to regret it. 
1470,FIRE ESCAPE: He made them unalive. 
1471,DOCTOR: Yes. Nothing could be proven so he got away with it. And as I
1472,"said, he was a brilliant architect. And space is a big place, so he got"
1473,"other work, if course, including Paradise Towers. "
1474,BIN LINER: Blank walls and cleaners. 
1475,"DOCTOR: Quite. And then he disappeared. Mayhaps, my dear Red Kangs,"
1476,mayhaps your parents thought they were being very clever by trapping
1477,him in his own building so he wouldn't finish it. But if they did such
1478,"a thing, it was very foolish. Because no matter how deep they buried"
1479,"him in Paradise Towers, he's bound to get out in the end."

1508,BIN LINER: In the Basement. The Cleaners have a secret alleviator. Red

1519,door.) 
1520,BLUE KANG: No. Red Kangs leave no outlooks. Blue Kangs have got into
1521,their Brainquarters and won the game. Blue Kangs are best! 
1522,(There is a shrill shouting match.) 
1523,DOCTOR: Please! Please! Please! This is no time for games. The future
1524,of Paradise Towers is at stake. We must all work together. You've got
1525,to help us. Do you understand?

1536,"the Red Kangs will agree that you've won this round of the game, but"
1537,there won't be any games worth playing if we don't discover who's
1538,ordering the killings. Will you let us go to the basement? 
1539,"BLUE KANG: More, I will come with you. "

1572,"to meet the Doctor. Aren't you going to have a swim, Pex? I just don't"
1573,understand you. I think all that talk of it being dangerous is just a
1574,trick by the Caretakers so they don't have to come and clean up the
1575,"pool all the time. Come on, lets investigate. Just a few minutes to"
1576,take the weight off my feet and then it's straight in to that lovely

1586,Cleaners orders that aren't my orders and killing people I didn't tell
1587,you to kill? 
1588,VOICE: Because the bodies the Cleaners brought were not right. 
1589,CARETAKER: Not right? What for? 
1590,VOICE: For me to live in. 
1591,"CARETAKER: To live in? I don't understand, my pet. "
1592,VOICE: Neither could they. That was the problem. 
1593,"(Behind the Caretaker, the Doctor and the Kangs enter.) "
1594,"CARETAKER: You see, all these bodies disappearing. People are beginning"
1595,"to notice, you know. "

1602,from you. 
1603,"CARETAKER: Oh, do you? And suppose I won't give it to you? "

1624,CARETAKER: Attention all Robotic Cleaners. Attention all Robotic
1625,Cleaners. At last Kroagnon can leave the basement prison they trapped
1626,his bodiless brain in and return in this borrowed body to the corridors
1627,and lifts of his own creation. They buried me away because I wanted to

1639,FIRE ESCAPE: And is the Chief Caretaker really unalive? 
1640,"DOCTOR: As himself, yes. But you saw what happened. I mean, up to now"
1641,"Kroagnon's simply been a mind without a body, as your parents must have"
1642,"left him. However, I fear he may have spent his time down there"
1643,devising a way of performing corpoelectroscopy. A way of transplanting
1644,his brilliant brain to some host body.

1739,MEL: And you're sure Kroagnon's been let loose again? 
1740,"DOCTOR: Oh, very much so. But we know so little about his plans. He's"

1754,"DOCTOR: That's Paradise Towers in a nutshell, I'm afraid. The Red Kangs"
1755,"didn't trust the Blue Kangs, and none of them trusted the Caretakers."

1773,"DEPUTY: Why, Chiefy, I thought you were lost. I "
1774,(There is a Cleaner outside.) 
1775,CARETAKER: The Towers have become appallingly dirty. 
1776,DEPUTY: Sorry? 
1777,CARETAKER: The whole place is polluted with flesh. Living flesh. 
1778,DEPUTY: Flesh? Did you say living flesh? 
1779,CARETAKER: Yes. 
1780,"DEPUTY: But Chief, you "
1781,"CARETAKER: Deputy, may I remind you that there is a rulebook and the"
1782,rulebook says that the orders of the Chief Caretaker are never to be
1783,questioned. 
1784,"DEPUTY: Yes, yes, yes, of course. Of course, Chief. Unless "
1785,CARETAKER: Unless? 
1786,"DEPUTY: Well, I think you may recall that there are certain cases"
1787,"specified when the rulebook can be overridden, and that is when the"
1788,Chief Caretaker 
1789,CARETAKER: Yes? 
1790,DEPUTY: Just isn't the Chief Caretaker. 
1791,"(The Deputy turns and runs, hurdling the Cleaner.)"
1792,
1793,[Outside the Caretaker Headquarters]
1794,
1795," CARETAKER: Leave him, leave him. We'll clean him"
1796,up when we clean up all the others.
1797,
1798, [Pool in the Sky]
1799,
1800, MADDY: The Cleaners have reached about floor one
1801,"hundred and fifteen now. All the Rezzies who can, have moved up to the"
1802,"higher floors, but not everyone was quick enough. "
1803,DOCTOR: And you're sure that person ordering the Cleaners to do this
1804,looks like the Chief Caretaker? 
1805,"BIN LINER: But he's unalive, Doctor. We saw it. "
1806,DOCTOR: Exactly. So the Great Architect has taken over his body. 
1807,FIRE ESCAPE: Why should we believe her? Rezzies are full of untruth. 
1808,BLUE KANG: And Kangs. Rotten old rubber neck 
1809,"DOCTOR: Please, please, be quiet. Shush. Be quiet. "
1810,"MADDY: Of course, I know that we residents have not always been as"
1811,"neighbourly as we might have been, but some have been worse than"
1812,others. And the worst have gone down the waste disposal chute. But
1813,those of us who are left want to let bygones be bygones. We're all in
1814,"danger now and, well, we're very sorry for what we did and we won't do"
1815,"it again. If we survive, that is. We need each other's help. "
1816,"DOCTOR: Well, you Kangs, what do you say to that? "
1817,(The Leaders have a quick huddle.) 
1818,"BIN LINER: I won't say Rezzies are ice hot, but yes, she's not telling"
1819,"untruths. And yes, we'll help each other. "
1820,DOCTOR: All agreed? Pex? 
1821,FIRE ESCAPE: Don't ask him. He's a cowardly cutlet. 
1822,DOCTOR: Fire Escape! Shush! Pex? 
1823,(Pex nods.) 
1824,"FIRE ESCAPE: We work with Rezzies, no to do. We work with Pex, no to"
1825,do. But the Caretakers? 
1826,KANGS: Never ever! 
1827,"DEPUTY: Ahem. Excuse me. I'm sorry to intrude like this, but I wondered"
1828,if I might have a word with you all.
1829,
1830, [Caretaker Headquarters]
1831,
1832, (The Kroagnon possessed Chief Caretaker is marking
1833,off the floors on a glass diagram.) 
1834,CARETAKER: One hundred and seventy. All the messy creatures will be
1835,moving up to the swimming pool zone on floor three oh four. Luckily
1836,they won't have time to make it too untidy before I destroy them! I
1837,have nothing to fear. Nobody knows my Paradise Towers better than I do.
1838,
1839,[Pool in the Sky]
1840,
1841," DOCTOR: We have very little time, so we must think"
1842,"clearly. Now Kroagnon, as we now must call the Chief Caretaker, is"
1843,"firmly installed in your headquarters. Am I right, Deputy Chief? "
1844,"DEPUTY: Yes, Doctor. "
1845,DOCTOR: So we must find a way of getting him out again. 
1846,BIN LINER: Set a trap for him. 
1847,DOCTOR: Precisely. 
1848,MADDY: We used to do that a lot with the rats. 
1849,MEL: But what about the Cleaners? 
1850,"DOCTOR: First, we must immobilise as many as we can. "
1851,DEPUTY: Doctor? 
1852,DOCTOR: Yes? 
1853,"DEPUTY: I know it's against the rulebook to say this, but I suppose"
1854,these are exceptional circumstances. 
1855,"DOCTOR: They could be described thus, yes. "
1856,"DEPUTY: Well, on the two hundred and forty fifth floor Sodium Street,"
1857,"corridor seventy five, there's a secret emergency supply kept for pests"
1858,going out of control. 
1859,MEL: An emergency supply of what? 
1860,DEPUTY: Explosives. 
1861,MEL: That'll do it. 
1862,FIRE ESCAPE: Ice hot! 
1863,"BIN LINER: With explosives and arrogance we can blow up the Cleaners,"
1864,no problem. 
1865,BLUE KANG: Send the Cleaners to the Cleaners. KANG: Yes! 
1866,MADDY: Most of the Rezzies make table cloths. We could throw them over
1867,the Cleaners to slow them down for you to shoot. 
1868,"FIRE ESCAPE: Ice hot, Maddy! "
1869,DOCTOR: We seem to be getting somewhere at last.
1870,
1871, [Caretaker Headquarters]
1872,
1873, CARETAKER: One hundred and sixty three. Time to
1874,see what the human garbage is up to in the swimming pool zone. 
1875,"COMPUTER: By express order of the Great Architect, surveillance of the"
1876,swimming pool is not allowed. Not allowed. 
1877, [Pool in the Sky]
1878,
1879," DOCTOR: Please, please! We must move on to the"
1880,main problem. How to persuade Kroagnon to leave his safety and come to
1881,a place of our choosing where we can trap and defeat him. 
1882,DEPUTY: He'll never leave there until we're all wiped out. We'll never
1883,manage to break in. I should know that. 
1884,"DOCTOR: Well, there is a way that might just work. "
1885,"FIRE ESCAPE: What's that, Doctor? "
1886,"DOCTOR: Well, you see, Kroagnon is undoubtedly a very clever and very"
1887,"proud being, and like many clever and proud beings likes to be"
1888,"appreciated by his equals. Now, I think if he had the chance to meet"
1889,"such a person, he would leave his lair to do so. "
1890,"MEL: Doctor, you're not going to go and "
1891,"DOCTOR: I've no choice, Mel. I mean, in all honesty, I am the only"
1892,obvious candidate. 
1893,MEL: You'll go out there and show yourself and be killed. 
1894,"DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no. That would be extremely futile. I will allow"
1895,"myself to be seen, and then somebody will go to Kroagnon and offer to"
1896,lead him to me. Right into our little trap. Now that person has a far
1897,more difficult and dangerous mission than I. 
1898,(Silence.) 
1899,PEX: I will go to Kroagnon. I am Pex and I am the 
1900,FIRE ESCAPE: Cowardly cutlet. 
1901,"PEX: Well you all have tasks to do. Caretakers, Residents, Kangs, why"
1902,should only Pex be left out? Pex the trained fighting machine. Pex the
1903,only 
1904,BIN LINER: Scaredy cat. 
1905,"MEL: Pex, are you sure you want to do this? "
1906,"PEX: Yes, I am. "
1907,DOCTOR: So be it.
1908,
1909, [Caretaker Headquarters]
1910,
1911,(Another monitor screen comes on.) 
1912,"DOCTOR : Hello, there, Kroagnon. This is the Doctor"
1913,"speaking. I don't believe we've met, though no doubt you've heard of"
1914,"me. I thought so. Anyway, I'd heard so much about Paradise Towers I"
1915,"thought I'd come and take a look and, believe me, I'm very"
1916,disappointed. It displays exactly what everyone says is your usual
1917,"failure as an architect. Not making allowances for people. Still, I'm"
1918,"sure if we managed to work together, we might just about make this"
1919,"place habitable. I've a few ideas which I might give to you, if you can"
1920,be bothered to listen. Bye for now.
1921,
1922, [Corridor]
1923,
1924, (A Cleaner enters. Maddy appears with two other
1925,women behind her.) 
1926,"MADDY: Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. I hope you don't mind my mentioning"
1927,"it, but I think you've missed some rubbish in the street back there. "
1928,(The Cleaner turns.) 
1929,MADDY: Charge! 
1930,(The two women throw a cloth of crocheted squares over the Cleaner's
1931,"'head', giving the Blue Kang plenty of time to take careful aim with"
1932,her crossbow. BANG!)
1933,
1934, [Red Kang Headquarters]
1935,
1936," DOCTOR: Now, you're clear what you have to do,"
1937,Pex? 
1938,MEL: And you are sure you want to go through with it? 
1939,PEX: I won't be unbrave again. 
1940,"DOCTOR: Remember, Pex, you must get him out of the Caretakers"
1941,Headquarters as quick as you can so that he doesn't see what's
1942,"happening to the Cleaners. But then, once he's out, take as long as you"
1943,"can. We need time. No heroics, just a cool clear head. "
1944,PEX: I can manage. 
1945,"DOCTOR: Good luck, Pex. "
1946,"MEL: I've been asked to give you this, Pex. It's a Kang bracelet. They"
1947,wanted to give it to you. They think you're not a scaredy cat any
1948,"longer but a real Kang. Good luck, Pex. "
1949,(Mel kisses him on the cheek. He offers her his gun.) 
1950,"PEX: You take this, Mel. Can't use it this time. "
1951,"(Bin Liner hands him three sticks of dynamite, and he leaves.)"

1958, [Caretaker Headquarters]
1959,
1960," CARETAKER: So, you say you could lead me to this"
1961,so-called Doctor who dares to mock me? 
1962,"PEX : Yes. He and the other, er, mobile rubbish have found"
1963,"a place to hide that they think you don't know about, and they're"
1964,"there, planning ways of resistance. "
1965,"CARETAKER: If you deliver me this Doctor, I'll give you a safe way out."
1966,
1967, [Red Kang Headquarters]
1968,
1969, MEL: Doctor? 
1970,DOCTOR: Yes? 
1971,MEL: The door's nearly back in place anyway but they're having trouble
1972,with the fortamolascope opening device. 
1973,DOCTOR: I'd better give them a hand. See what you can do to help the
1974,"Kangs down there. Oh, and Mel, don't forget to leave the escape hatch"
1975,uncovered so that I can make my exit. I just hope that Pex doesn't lose
1976,"his nerve and hurry, otherwise it won't be Kroagnon who's caught in a"
1977,"booby trap, it'll be us."

1980,
1981,(Red and Blue Kangs stay out of sight of Pex and
1982,"the Caretaker, and their two Cleaner escort.) "
1983,"CARETAKER: This is not some trick, is it? "
1984,"PEX: No, no. "
1985,KROAGNON: I've only just began to enjoy walking around my marvellous
1986,Towers in this body and I wouldn't deal very kindly with anybody who
1987,"was stupid enough to lay a trap for me. Not frightened, are you? "
1988,"PEX: I, I think we ought to hurry, Great Architect. Please? Let's"
1989,hurry. 
1990,KROAGNON: As you wish. 
1991,(Pex walks on. The Caretaker starts to lurch after him and has a good
1992,look around the apparently deserted Square. Once the Cleaners have
1993,"gone, the Blue Kang leader uses the telephone.) "
1994,BLUE KANG: They're on their way.

1999,MEL: What's happening? 
2000,BIN LINER: They're making all speed here. 
2001,MEL: What? 
2002,BIN LINER: Pex has been a scaredy cat. They'll be here in no time. 
2003,DOCTOR: I must tell the Doctor. 
2004,"BIN LINER: Danger, tripwires. This way. "
2005,(Bin Liner leads Mel through the ventilation grill.)

2009, DOCTOR: That should do it.

2012,DEPUTY: And we're not ready for him. 
2013,"DOCTOR: Oh, Pex. Move back, quickly. "
2014,"FIRE ESCAPE: Oh, but Doctor, he'll make you unalive. "
2015,"DOCTOR: There's only one way this might work, and for that I need to be"
2016,on my own. 
2017,MEL: Come on. 
2018,(The possessed Chief Caretaker lurches up to the Doctor.) 
2019,CARETAKER: Well? 
2020,"DOCTOR: Well, now, Kroagnon, how nice of you to drop in. I am so glad."
2021,I wanted to have a few words with you about the shoddy design of this
2022,"building. I mean, take this door for instance. Look at it. "
2023,"CARETAKER: There was nothing wrong with it when I built it, unless"
2024,humanoid creatures have damaged it. 
2025,"DOCTOR: Well, speaking as an expert, I'm prepared to tell the universe"
2026,"you couldn't design a simple doorknob. I mean, look. "
2027,(The Caretaker steps right up to the door. The Doctor opens it and
2028,"tries to push him through, but fails. The Caretaker knocks the Doctor"
2029,across the corridor. Pex turns to run but the two Cleaners are behind
2030,him so he runs past the Doctor towards Mel and the others instead. The
2031,Caretaker picks up the Doctor and beats him against the wall.) 
2032,DOCTOR: Pex! Help!

2034,DOCTOR: Pex! Pex! 
2035,"(Pex runs back and pulls the Doctor from the Caretaker's grasp,"
2036,unfortunately throwing him into the wall and briefly knocking him out.
2037,"Then he launches himself at the Caretaker, who shrugs him off and takes"
2038,the bundle of dynamite. Pex head-butts the Caretaker and they both
2039,"tumble into the Red Kang Headquarters, triggering the tripwires and"
2040,creating the planned big BOOM!)

2044," (The Kangs kneel around their monument, Red and"
2045,"Blue alternate, watched by Rezzies and Caretakers.) "
2046,BIN LINER: Hail Pex. Hail the unalive who gave his life for the Towers.
2047,In life he was not a Kang but in death he was brave and bold as a Kang
2048,should be. 
2049,KANGS: Hail Pex. Hail the unalive. Hail Pex. Hail the unalive. 
2050,MEL: Poor Pex. 
2051,"DOCTOR: Indeed, poor Pex. But look, Mel, they're all here. The"
2052,"Caretakers, the Rezzies, the Kangs. This would never have happened"
2053,before. Perhaps now they'll all start working together. 
2054,"(Fire Escape, Bin Liner and the Blue Kang leader join the Doctor and"
2055,Mel.) 
2056,"DOCTOR: Ah, Fire Escape. Now, have you managed to remove the Kang"

2060,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you very much. "
2061,"BLUE KANG: We're sorry you must go, Doctor and Mel. We've made you an"
2062,"honorary Kang, Doctor. "

2064,(The Blue Kang holds out a blue scarf. Fire Escape turns it over to
2065,reveal a red side.) 
2066,FIRE ESCAPE: Both. 
2067,"DOCTOR: Ah, well I'll be honoured to wear it. And all my best wishes to"
2068,the future of Paradise Towers.

2070,piece of metal junk standing there.)
