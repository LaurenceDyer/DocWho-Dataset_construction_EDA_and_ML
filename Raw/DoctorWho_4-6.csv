23,
24, [Tardis] 
25, (The Tardis is going haywire.) 
26,JAMIE: What's he done? 
27,"BEN: Doctor, do something! "
28,DOCTOR: I'm trying to! 
29,JAMIE: We're not going to make it. 
30,(Everyone is being thrown across the room and back as the Doctor fights
31,the controls. Soon everything settles down.) 
32,DOCTOR: I have it back in control again. 
33,"BEN: Here, we're landing. Look. Coming at a fair rate. "
34,"JAMIE: Oh, thank the Lord for that. You know, Doctor, I'll never ask"
35,you to do that again. 
36,"DOCTOR: Huh? Oh, no. There must have been a reason for that. "
37,"POLLY: Anyway, Doctor, you've done it. It's Mars. It must be. You're"
38,landing the Tardis exactly where you said you would. 
39,(The Tardis materialises amongst magnificent desolation.) 
40,"BEN: Hey, wait a mo! This don't look like Mars to me. "
41,POLLY: How would you know? You never seen it. 
42,"BEN: No, Duchess, but I have seen pictures of the moon's surface and"
43,that's what this looks like. 
44,JAMIE: That's the moon? 
45,"POLLY: Doctor, is it the moon? "
46,(The Doctor nods.) 
47,"BEN: Oh, well, you weren't too far out, were you? Only about two"
48,hundred million miles. 
49,"DOCTOR: All right, let's move on. While we can. "
50,POLLY: Now wait a minute! 
51,BEN: What? 
52,POLLY: You don't expect to land us on the moon and let us fly off just
53,"like that, do you? "
54,"BEN: Yeah, at least let us have a look around! "
55,JAMIE: That picture canna be the moon. The moon's way up in the sky. 
56,DOCTOR: Where do you think you're going? 
57,BEN: You're not going to tell us there's no shore leave. 
58,"POLLY: Ah, please, Doctor. The Tardis isn't out of control or anything"
59,is it? 
60,"DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no. It was just a bumpy landing, that's all. "
61,BEN: Yeah? 
62,"DOCTOR: Well, if you must go ashore, only half an hour. "
63,BEN: Right. 
64,POLLY: Super. 
65,DOCTOR: You can't go ashore like that! You need space suits. There's no
66,"atmosphere out there. Come on, there's some in the chest. "
67,(Jamie is still staring at the scanner.) 
68,JAMIE: We'll maybe meet the old man in the moon. 
69,BEN: You won't meet nobody mate if you don't get some gear on. 
70,JAMIE: What? Oh aye.
71,
72, [Lunar surface]
73,
74,"(Some time later, all four of them are suited up"
75,and they leave the Tardis to look around.) 
76,"DOCTOR: Come on now, let's go over here. "
77,"POLLY: Hey, look at this. "
78,DOCTOR: It's deserted. 
79,JAMIE: I don't think I like it. 
80,(Polly sees a pulsating light.) 
81,"POLLY: Look, over there. "
82,JAMIE: I'll don't see anything. 
83,BEN: What did you see? 
84,POLLY: Some sort of great glow in the sky. 
85,"BEN: It's probably your eyes getting used to the lunar light, hey,"
86,Doctor? 
87,DOCTOR: Possibly. 
88,POLLY: What do we need these great clogs for? 
89,DOCTOR: Try a little jump. 
90,POLLY: All right. 
91,"(Polly takes a small jump and rises about ten feet, falling slowly and"
92,rolling gently as she lands. Ben and Jamie copy her and collide.) 
93,DOCTOR: Careful! One tear in that space suit and you'll suffocate. 
94,"POLLY: You never told me you'd taken ballet lessons, Ben. "
95,(Polly takes a big jump to a the crater rim.) 
96,"POLLY: Come on, it's easy. "
97,"BEN: Look out, here I come. "
98,(Jamie jumps too far and goes over the rim and out of sight.) 
99,POLLY: Where's he gone? 
100,BEN: Over there. 
101,(From the rim of the crater they look down on a large domed building.) 
102,POLLY: What on Earth? Look! 
103,BEN: Blimey! What is it? 
104,"POLLY: Doctor, what is it? "
105,DOCTOR: I don't know. 
106,"POLLY: Hey, I can see Jamie. There he is. "
107,(Jamie is lying unconscious by the dome.) 
108,"BEN: Hey, there's somebody coming out. "
109,"DOCTOR: Come on, let's go. "
110,(Two spacesuited figures come out of the dome's airlock and take Jamie
111,"inside. The Doctor, Ben and Polly hurry to the dome and Ben knocks on"
112,"the airlock. Then it slides open. After a brief pause, they all go in.)"
113,
114, [Control room]
115,
116,(The moonbase is a weather control centre. A small
117,team of scientists govern weather patterns on Earth using a powerful
118,"device called the Gravitron. A map of the Earth dominates one wall, and"
119,the Gravitron probe is in a transparent dome on one side of the room
120,with it's power controls in an insulated room. Each person wears a
121,"numbered uniform, and the gravitron technicians wear protective"
122,headgear. They are monitoring a Pacific hurricane or typhoon when one
123,of the workers collapses. An alarm sounds.) 
124,"BENOIT: (2nd in command, French) What on Earth is it? "
125,(Played by  Andre
126,"Maranne, possibly the only genuine French actor the BBC"
127,knew.) 
128,(A web of black lines covers the stricken man's face.) 
129,HOBSON: (base commander) I don't know. Get him along to the Medical
130,unit. 
131,BENOIT: But Doctor Evans has gone down with it as well. 
132,"HOBSON: Yes, I know that but the relief Doctor from Earth should be"
133,here on the next shuttle rocket. 
134,"BENOIT: Yes, yes, of course. Bob, give me a hand, will you? "
135,"BOB: Yes, right. "
136,(Benoit and Bob carry the man out.) 
137,"HOBSON: And Jules, you take over. Come on, it won't bite you. There"
138,"must be some source to this infection. Look, we'd better get the lads"
139,"in here and tell them what's happening. Get them on the blower, would"
140,"you, Nils? "
141,"NILS: (the number 3, Danish) Okay, Hobby. (into intercom) Nils"
142,"speaking. We, er, we've got a bit of a flap on up here. "
143,"(Hobson is distracted by the arrival of the Doctor, Polly and Ben next"
144,door.) 
145,[Reception room]
146,
147,NILS : Mister Hobson wants a word with you all
148,in weather control room. Quick as you can. 
149,HOBSON: Hello. Where did you lot spring from? Don't tell me the shuttle
150,rocket's arrived already? 
151,"DOCTOR: No, it hasn't. "
152,"SAM: There was another one with them, sir. Bob's taken him along to the"
153,Medical unit. He's all right. He's just knocked himself out or
154,something. 
155,"HOBSON: Oh no, if we haven't got enough troubles already. Have they"
156,been through the sterile room? 
157,"SAM: Yes, Hobby. "
158,DOCTOR: We don't want to cause you any trouble. Just let us collect our
159,young friend and we'll be off. 
160,"HOBSON: Hey, not so fast. "
161,"POLLY: Please, let me go and see Jamie. "
162,"BENOIT: I will take you there, mademoiselle, if you come with me. "
163,"HOBSON: All right, young lady. You can carry on. "
164,BENOIT: This way. 
165,(Polly and Benoit leave.) 
166,HOBSON: But I'd just like to have a word with you two. You could do
167,with a extra bacteria check by the look of it. 
168,DOCTOR: Bacteria check? 
169,HOBSON: That's what I said. 
170,"BEN: Well, thanks. "
171,DOCTOR: I'll have you know our Tardis is as sterile as 
172,HOBSON: Tardis? 
173,DOCTOR: Our space craft. 
174,"NILS: They're all here, sir. Any time you're ready. "
175,"HOBSON: Right. Well, we'll learn about your spacecraft a little later."
176,"Meanwhile, you'd better come along with me, meet my team and listen to"
177,what I have to say. 
178,DOCTOR: Thank you very much.
179,
180,[Control room] 
181,"HOBSON: Well, you know what this place is? "
182,"DOCTOR: Well, it looks like some sort of weather control centre? Ah,"
183,yes. And that's the thing with which you control the weather. That's
184,"the culprit, then. "
185,BEN: Ay? 
186,DOCTOR: That's what gave us such a bumpy landing. Some sort of gravity
187,device? 
188,"HOBSON: Some sort of gravity device. You are from Earth, aren't you? "
189,DOCTOR: Yes. 
190,"HOBSON: Well, where've you been for the past 20 years. Every school kid"
191,knows about the Gravitron in there. 
192,"DOCTOR: Ah, yes. It must be about the year 2050, Ben. "
193,"HOBSON: We've got a proper Rip Van Winkle here. It's 2070, in case"
194,you'd like to know. 
195,DOCTOR: There you are. I was only twenty years out. 
196,"HOBSON: Well, before we all forget what century we're in, I'd better"
197,tell you why I've called you here. 
198,DOCTOR: Won't you introduce us first? I am a Doctor. 
199,HOBSON: A Doctor? You're arrived just in time. We need your help. 
200,DOCTOR: Ah. Do you? 
201,"HOBSON: I'll see you in a moment. Now, this virus "
202,"DOCTOR: Well, I may be able to help you if you'll introduce us. "
203,"HOBSON: Right, Doctor. You'd better meet them all. We're all scientists"
204,"here, you see. No room for idle hands, I see to that. Roger Benoit,"
205,"beside you there, is my assistant. He takes over as Chief Scientist if"
206,anything happens to me. He's a physicist like me and Joe Benson there.
207,"Nils, our mad Dane, is an astronomer and mathematician as is Charlie"
208,"here. Ralph, Jules and Franz are geologists. When they're not acting as"
209,"cooks, looks-outs, general and, you know, handymen. "
210,DOCTOR: And this is where you control the Earth's weather? I see. 
211,"BENOIT: The gravitron there controls the tides, the tides controls the"
212,"weather. And from this console here we plot it all on that map. Simple,"
213,eh? 
214,"BEN: Oh, yeah, very simple. Wish we'd had all this back in 1966. "
215,DOCTOR: Was it a bad year then? 
216,(An alarm sounds.) 
217,BEN: What's that? What's happened? 
218,(A man has collapsed inside the gravitron chamber.) 
219,"HOBSON: It's Jim. Quick, Franz, take over here. "
220,(Franz puts on a helmet and goes into the chamber. Ralph and John carry
221,Jim to the medical unit.) 
222,BENOIT: Indicator Five over the Pacific is starting to move. 
223,BEN: What does that mean? 
224,DOCTOR: Some form of change in the weather. 
225,HOBSON: We're soon hear from Earth what it means. 
226,NILS: Here it comes! 
227,CONTROL : International Space Control Headquarters Earth calling
228,Weather Control Moon. Come in please. 
229,NILS: Moonport standing by. 
230,CONTROL : Earth calling Weather Control Moon. Come in please. 
231,NILS: Moonport standing by. 
232,HOBSON: Hobson here. 
233,CONTROL : What's happening up there? The hurricane you were guiding
234,is now 45 degrees off course. It's threatening Hawaii. 
235,HOBSON: One of my men was taken ill. We're operational again now. 
236,CONTROL : The controller would like to know the cause of the
237,illness. 
238,"HOBSON: Yes, so would we. We've now got three men down with this"
239,"mystery virus in the past few hours, including the doctor. "
240,CONTROL : One moment please. Stand by for further instructions. 
241,"HOBSON: Just hang on another couple of minutes, lads. We'd better hear"
242,what the great Mister Rinberg has to say. 
243,NILS: Hobby? 
244,HOBSON: Yes. 
245,NILS: There it is again. I'll play it back to you. 
246,"HOBSON : Yes, so would we. We've now got three men down with this"
247,"mystery virus in the past few hours, including the Doctor. "
248,CONTROL : One moment please. Stand by for further instructions. 
249,NILS: Hear the big noise ratio on that re-run? We're being monitored
250,again. 
251,HOBSON: Monitored? 
252,"NILS: Someone, not too far away from the base, is listening to every"
253,word we say. 
254,"CONTROL : Moonbase, Moonbase. Come in, Moonbase. "
255,HOBSON: Still standing by. 
256,[Spacecraft]
257,
258,(An alien spacecraft is concealed a short way from
259,"the dome, monitoring the conversation.) "
260,HOBSON : Well? 
261,CONTROL : Your instructions are to send blood samples back to Earth
262,for investigation. 
263,"HOBSON : Well, when can we do that? The next shuttle rocket's not"
264,for another month. 
265,CONTROL : Then they must be put on that rocket. In the meantime the
266,Moonbase is to be put in quarantine.
267,
268, [Control room]
269,
270,HOBSON: Quarantine? What if these men aren't fit
271,enough to get back to work. I shall need replacements. 
272,"CONTROL : If you radio information about this virus, we'll do our"
273,best to identify it and suggest treatment. 
274,HOBSON: I demand to speak to Rinberg.
275,
276, [Space ship]
277,
278,CONTROL : The controller is busy. I'm sorry.
279,Over and out.
280,
281, [Control room]
282,
283,NILS: That whole conversion was monitored by
284,someone or something. 
285,"HOBSON: Oh, never mind about that now. That Rinberg fellow just won't"
286,talk to you. How can we trace down this mystery illness with the doctor
287,himself down with it. 
288,DOCTOR: We'd better get out of these things and see how Jamie is.
289,Perhaps I could be of help in the sick bay now. 
290,HOBSON: Anything you can do. Bob! 
291,"BOB: Yes, Mister Hobson? "
292,"HOBSON: Show him to the Medical unit, will you? "
293,"BOB: Yes, of course, sir. Will you come this way, please. "
294,DOCTOR: Yes. Thank you. 
295,"(Bob, Ben and the Doctor leave.) "
296,"HOBSON: Well, you all heard the position. We don't know what this"
297,"infection is or how it got into the base, but I want you all to take"
298,extra precautions while this emergency is on. We may be short-handed
299,for quite a while.
300,
301, [Sickbay]
302,
303,(Polly is attaching a medical monitor to Jamie's
304,chest.) 
305,"POLLY: Is this how it goes, Doctor? "
306,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. Then this unit automatically controls the"
307,"pulse, the temperature and the breathing. "
308,POLLY: A sort of electronic doctor. 
309,DOCTOR: Yes. Almost got striped trousers. 
310,BEN: And it even gives him medicines too? 
311,"DOCTOR: Yes, it will do very nearly everything. "
312,"POLLY: It can't be nice to him. Oh dear. How do you think he is,"
313,Doctor? 
314,"DOCTOR: Oh, he's not too bad. He's a bit concussed and feverish, but"
315,he'll be all right with rest. 
316,JAMIE: The Piper. The McCrimmon Piper. Don't let him get me! 
317,DOCTOR: Piper? 
318,"POLLY: Some legend of his clan. As far as I can make out, this piper"
319,appears to a McCrimmon just before he dies. 
320,DOCTOR: Has this phantom piper appeared to Jamie yet? 
321,"POLLY: You don't believe it, do you? "
322,"DOCTOR: No, but he does. It's important to him. "
323,POLLY: He keeps asking us to keep the piper away from him. 
324,"DOCTOR: Good. Well, we'll see whether we can do just that. "
325,"BEN: Well, carry on, nurse. "
326,"POLLY: Well, at least I tried to help. With a ward full of sick men and"
327,"no doctor, somebody's got to do something. "
328,(A patient is groaning.) 
329,POLLY: I wonder who this is? 
330,"DOCTOR: Don't get too near, Polly. Have a look on his chart. "
331,"POLLY: Yes, that's a good idea. "
332,BEN: It's Doctor Evans. 
333,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. The station doctor. He was the first one to get it. "
334,POLLY: He looks one of the worst. 
335,DOCTOR: There's something about this epidemic that I don't quite
336,understand. It's not like a real disease at all. It's almost as if 
337,BEN: Not real? What more do you want? 
338,DOCTOR: I don't know. But there are certain signs and symptoms which
339,"don't add up. Ben, I want you to go along to the control room and keep"
340,an eye on things. 
341,"BEN: Well, how? "
342,"DOCTOR: I don't know. Give a hand, do anything, but keep your eyes and"
343,ears open. 
344,BEN: Right. 
345,DOCTOR: There's something very wrong here. Very wrong indeed.
346,
347, [Control room]
348,
349,(The base is on it's night cycle. Benoit returns
350,from a break.) 
351,"BENOIT: Still up, Hobby? Why not take a rest. Go and get some sleep. "
352,HOBSON: How can I rest with that thing up the spout. You know the score
353,as well as I do. Five units off centre we lift half London into space.
354,Five more and the Atlantic water level goes up three feet. Rinberg just
355,"doesn't understand the pressure we're under. Hey, you! What do you"
356,thinking you're doing skulking there? 
357,"BEN: Well, I was just wondering if I can help, sir. "
358,HOBSON: Help? How could you help? 
359,BENOIT: We could do with an extra pair of hands. He can help me. 
360,"HOBSON: Well, keep him away from me, that's all. All right, I'll go and"
361,lie down. Call me if anything happens. 
362,"BENOIT: Yes, of course. "
363,"HOBSON: Oh, by the way. There were two more of those momentary drops in"
364,air pressure while I was on. I've put them in the log. 
365,BENOIT: Right. 
366,(Hobson leaves.) 
367,"BENOIT: Well, there are some coffee cups to clear away if you wish to"
368,"be helpful. And er, oh er, Ralph, that is, no. 14, needs a hand down in"
369,the food store. Can you find your way there? 
370,"BEN: Yeah, I'll find it. "
371,BENOIT: Good boy. 
372, [Food store]
373,
374,(Ralph is loading a trolley with supplies from the
375,shelves and ticking them off a list. He picks up a sack of sugar and
376,the contents spill onto the floor through a hole in the bottom. He
377,throws it into the waste disposal.) 
378,RALPH: (american) Anyone would think we've got rats up here. 
379,(A tin falls.) 
380,RALPH: Who's that? Who is it? 
381,"BEN: It's only me, mate. "
382,"RALPH: Oh, for heaven's sake. Don't go sneaking around like that. "
383,"BEN: Blimey, you lot aren't half edgy. "
384,"RALPH: You will be too, mate, if you've been up here long enough. Say,"
385,are you responsible for the broken bags here. 
386,"BEN: Come off it. I've only just arrived, haven't I? "
387,"RALPH: Okay. See and you can find that light. Round the back there,"
388,most likely. 
389,BEN: Okay. 
390,RALPH: Let's see. We still need some more milk and sugar. 
391,(As Ralph searches the shelves a huge figure looms out of the darkness.
392,There's an electric shock sound. Ralph's body is dragged away before
393,Ben returns.) 
394,BEN: Number 14? Ralph? Where are you? Scarpered. Funny bloke. 
395, [Sickbay]
396,
397,(Polly is dozing.) 
398,POLLY: What's that? 
399,"DOCTOR: Shh. It's all right, Polly, it's only me. We don't want to wake"
400,"everybody up, do we? You look as though you could do with some sleep"
401,yourself. 
402,POLLY: I'm all right. What have you got there? 
403,"DOCTOR: Oh, I've been doing a little investigation. "
404,POLLY: A piece of silver paper. What is it? 
405,DOCTOR: I don't know. 
406,(The lights dim.) 
407,POLLY: What's happened? 
408,"DOCTOR: Oh, it's nothing. It probably just a changeover in the time"
409,cycle. 
410,POLLY: What do you mean? 
411,"DOCTOR: Oh well, you see, it's rather interesting really. You see, on"
412,the moon they have a fortnight of days and a fortnight of nights. 
413,POLLY: Well? 
414,"DOCTOR: Well, it's obvious, isn't it? They have to make their own day"
415,"and night artificially up here, or it would upset their whole"
416,biological time clock. 
417,POLLY: Their what? 
418,DOCTOR: They won't know whether they were coming or going. Get it? 
419,POLLY: Yes. 
420,DOCTOR: Clever girl. QED. That's why it's dark up here. 
421,"POLLY: Oh, I see what you mean. Yes, of course. How stupid of me. "
422,DOCTOR: Of course along at the control centre it's probably broad
423,"daylight. Polly, you wouldn't be making fun of me, would you? "
424,POLLY: No. 
425,(A man screams.) 
426,POLLY: Doctor Evans! 
427,"(Evans is sweating heavily, and delirious.) "
428,"EVANS: The hand. No, don't touch me. No. The silver hand. (scream) "
429,"POLLY: Doctor, is he? "
430,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid he is. "
431,POLLY: What are we going to do? 
432,DOCTOR: What did he mean by the silver hand? I'd better report this to
433,Mister Hobson. 
434, [Control room]
435,
436,(Ben is reporting Ralph's disappearance.) 
437,HOBSON: Can't find him? Ralph? 
438,"BEN: Well, I was helping him load some stores and he just disappeared. "
439,"HOBSON: What, in this place? Well, there are only nineteen of us. "
440,DOCTOR: Have you tried his quarters? 
441,BEN: Yeah. 
442,HOBSON: Why didn't you report this to me? 
443,"BEN: Well, I'm just telling you now, aren't I? "
444,HOBSON: Now what is the matter? 
445,DOCTOR: I'm very sorry. It's Doctor Evans. 
446,HOBSON: Well? 
447,DOCTOR: I'm afraid he's dead. 
448,HOBSON: Dead? No. 
449,BENOIT: This must be reported at once. 
450,"HOBSON: Yes, yes. No! No, we haven't got enough data yet. You know what"
451,they're like down there. I'll come to the sick bay with you. Come on.

455,(Polly is helping Jamie drink a glass of water.) 
456,"POLLY: Here. Gently, Jamie. "
457,(Jamie's eyes widen in panic as he sees something behind Polly.) 
458,POLLY: Jamie! 
459,"(Jamie tries to speak, then passes out again. Polly turns and screams."
460,"The Doctor, Hobson and others run in.) "
461,HOBSON: What the matter? 
462,POLLY: Something just went out of that door! 
463,HOBSON: Nils! John! 
464,DOCTOR: What was it? 
465,NILS: Nothing. Nothing there. 
466,HOBSON: Your nerves are getting the better of you. Where's Evans' body?
467,
468,POLLY: Over there. 
469,"HOBSON: All right, let's get it over. "
470,(Nils lifts the blanket but the bed is empty.) 
471,HOBSON: Is this someone's idea of a particularly bad joke? 
472,"DOCTOR: This is no joke, believe me! "
473,"BENOIT: Mister Hobson, Mister Hobson, you are wanted! Another man's"
474,collapsed at the controls. The Gravitron has gone off alignment again. 
475,HOBSON: Come on! And you'd better find that doctor's body or out you
476,"all go, quarantine or no quarantine. "
477,"(Hobson, Benoit and co all leave.) "
478,POLLY: I don't understand what could have happened. I must have dozed
479,off or something. One thing I am sure of. Something went out of that
480,door just as you came in. 
481,"DOCTOR: That body can't just have vanished. Polly, I'm going to leave"
482,"you alone, now just for a minute. "
483,POLLY: All right. 
484,JAMIE: Water. Water. 
485,POLLY: I'll go and get you some. 
486,JAMIE: Water. 
487,(Polly leaves. The other door slides open and a tall figure moves
488,across the room to Jamie's bed. Jamie looks at it.)
489,JAMIE: It's you. The phantom piper! 
490, Episode Two
491,
492, [Sickbay]
493,
494,(Jamie suddenly sits up and stares at the tall
495,silver figure in front of him. It has a blank metal face with round eye
496,holes and a slit for the mouth. Tubes come from where its ears should
497,be and connect at a round device on the top of it's head. We seen
498,"something like this before, but Jamie hasn't.) "
499,"JAMIE: No! No, I'll not go with you. Do you hear me, piper? No, leave"
500,"me. Leave me, I'll not go with you, do you hear me? Leave me. No, I'll"
501,not go with you. 
502,(The cyberman goes round the other beds.) 
503,JAMIE: I'll fight you every inch of the way. I'll not go with ya. No.
504,No. 
505,(The cyberman takes the blanket off another patient and carries off the
506,struggling man.) 
507,"JAMIE: Leave me, piper. No, leave me, I'll not go. "
508,"(Polly returns with the water for Jamie. She screams. Hobson, the"
509,"Doctor, Ben and two other men run in.) "
510,"DOCTOR: Polly! Polly, what's happened? "
511,"POLLY: Oh, Doctor! Doctor, it was horrible. A great creature like a,"
512,like a Cyberman. 
513,"DOCTOR: It's all right. Don't be frightened. Whatever it was, it's all"
514,gone now. 
515,"POLLY: Yes, but Doctor, the Cyberman was carrying one of the patients"
516,out! 
517,DOCTOR: Cyberman? 
518,HOBSON: Cyberman? What are you talking about? 
519,POLLY: I'm sure it was. I'm sure it was! 
520,DOCTOR: Are you sure? 
521,JAMIE: I'll not go with you! 
522,"BEN: All right, mate. You're safe now. Take it easy. "
523,"POLLY: Yes it did, I promise you. "
524,"HOBSON: She's right. There's another one gone. Sam, Jules, you've got"
525,to find these men. They can't just disappear in a place this size.
526,"Search every square inch, don't come back until you've found them. Now"
527,move. 
528,(Sam and Jules leave.) 
529,"HOBSON: Now, supposing you tell me your story. What did you see? "
530,"POLLY: Well, I went out to get Jamie some water and when I came back I"
531,saw this giant man or creature or something just going out of the door
532,carrying one of the patients like a doll. I think it was a Cyberman. 
533,HOBSON: Forget the Cyberman part. Then what? 
534,"POLLY: Well, then nothing. The door shut and then you came in. "
535,HOBSON: What do you know about all this? 
536,DOCTOR: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. 
537,"HOBSON: We'll see about that in a minute. This thing you saw, what was"
538,it like? 
539,"POLLY: It was enormous and silver, and it had holes in it's head for"
540,"eyes, like a robot! "
541,HOBSON: A robot? 
542,"BEN: But the Cybermen were all killed when Mondas blew up, weren't"
543,they? 
544,"HOBSON: Stop this Cyberman nonsense. There were Cybermen, every child"
545,"knows that, but they were all destroyed ages ago. "
546,DOCTOR: So we all thought. 
547,HOBSON: That's enough. Now let's have a little calm thinking. For the
548,past two weeks a completely unknown disease has appeared in the base.
549,"People drop in their tracks, they develop this black pattern on their"
550,"skin. Then some of the patients disappear, right? Well, they can't"
551,"leave the base without wearing space suits, and there are no space"
552,"suits missing, so where are they? "
553,DOCTOR: I must say it does sound a little odd. 
554,HOBSON: More than a little. Well I do know one thing. A new disease
555,"starts, people disappear and then you turn up. "
556,POLLY: And you think we did it. 
557,"BEN: Oh, come off it, we haven't done a thing. "
558,"HOBSON: That's as maybe. I don't know who you are, what you are or"
559,where you come
560,from. But you can get off the moon now. 
561,"BEN: Yeah, well that suits me fine. The sooner the better. "
562,"DOCTOR: No, Ben. We can't go yet. "
563,"BEN: Well, why not? They don't want us here. "
564,DOCTOR: Because there is something evil here and we must stay. 
565,HOBSON: Evil? Don't be daft. 
566,DOCTOR: Evil is what I meant. There are some corners of the universe
567,which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against
568,"everything that we believe in. They must be fought. This disease, for"
569,"instance. It isn't really a disease at all, but I can help you with it."
570,You'll see. I'll find the cause for you. 
571,"HOBSON: Will you, indeed? "
572,"DOCTOR: Yes, certainly. I just need to examine a few things, that's"
573,all. It should be simple. 
574,"HOBSON: Well, I'm not sure. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you"
575,just one Earth day cycle to find the cause. 
576,BEN: Earth what? 
577,HOBSON: Twenty four hours. 
578,BEN: But that's no time at all. 
579,HOBSON: It's all the time you're going to get. Then you get off the
580,"moon, complete with this bloke here. "
581,POLLY: But you can't move him. He's very ill. 
582,"DOCTOR: We accept. Now tell me, you have pathological equipment here,"
583,yes? 
584,"HOBSON: Yes, Evans was working on an extensive research project. It's"
585,all in here. 
586,(They go to an area marked off by a ring of workbenches and shelves.) 
587,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'll have a look in here. "
588,HOBSON: It's quite a small unit. We're not equipped to deal with a full
589,"scale epidemic, you understand. Do you think you can manage? "
590,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think I can. "
591,"HOBSON: Right. Well, I'll leave you to it. But don't forget, twenty"
592,four hours. 
593,(Hobson leaves. The Doctor takes a tray of items over to a patient.) 
594,"BEN: What are you going to do, Doctor? "
595,DOCTOR: We're going to start with this one. 
596,"POLLY: Listen, are you really a medical doctor? "
597,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think I was once, Polly. I think I took a degree once in"
598,"Glasgow. 1888 I think. Lister. Hold that for me, will you? "
599,"(The Doctor swabs a black-lined hand, and the arm convulses.) "
600,DOCTOR: It's all right. He's quite unconscious. 
601,"BEN: Well look, what can we do to help? "
602,"DOCTOR: I shall need to examine everything. Clothes, boots, food,"
603,"towels, soap, everything. Will you get them for me, please? "
604,POLLY: Have you any idea what it might be? 
605,DOCTOR: No. Not an idea. But we'll find it out.
606,
607, [Control room]
608,
609,HOBSON: I don't understand it. I'm sure there's a
610,lack of co-ordination somewhere. 
611,"BENOIT: Yes, but where? "
612,"HOBSON: On the indicators, look. It should be steady as a rock. "
613,BENOIT: The fault must be in the gravitron. 
614,"HOBSON: Nils, here. "
615,NILS: Yes Hobby? 
616,HOBSON: I'm going to run a test. Move the probe and we'll see if the
617,indicators move the right distance on the map. Okay? 
618,NILS: Right. 
619,"HOBSON: Benoit, keep an eye on the probe itself, will you? "
620,"BENOIT: Okay. All yours, Bob. "
621,BOB: Right. 
622,(Benoit walks over to watch the gravitron probe.) 
623,"HOBSON: Deflect probe five degrees, now. Way off. Five degrees should"
624,put them over Iceland. Move the probe back again. 
625,NILS: Right. 
626,BENOIT: The probe seems to deflect all right. 
627,HOBSON: The fault must be here. This could be a major disaster if we
628,can't stabilise the Earth's field. 
629,"NILS: If we lose that hurricane, Mister Hobson, all hell will break"
630,loose on the Earth. I've a wife and family. 
631,"HOBSON: Yeah, you're not the only one. Roger, check the potentiometers."
632,
633,BENOIT: Right. 
634,(Benoit puts on a helmet and enters the control area.) 
635,"HOBSON: Nils, check the gravitation units. Shake it up. We haven't got"
636,much time. 
637,"NILS: Field stabilising at 48, Mister Hobson. "
638,HOBSON: Prepare to move probe. Check co-ordinates. We've got to hold
639,that hurricane in the Pacific. Stand by. Now. 
640,(Benoit returns.) 
641,BENOIT: Twenty degree tilt complete. 
642,HOBSON: The field's not correcting. We'll have to increase the reactor
643,power. 
644,BENOIT: You can't do that. The torus will burn out. 
645,HOBSON: It's all we can do. 
646,(The communication centre comes into life.) 
647,CONTROL : International Space Control. 
648,R/T: Earth calling. 
649,CONTROL : Earth calling Moon Weather Control. Stand by. Stand by
650,for the controller. 
651,R/T: This is Moonbase. Come in please. 
652,CONTROL : We wish to speak to Mister Hobson. 
653,HOBSON: Hobson speaking. 
654,CONTROL : Stand by for the Controller. 
655,HOBSON: Right. He's actually going to speak to us this time. 
656,"RINBERG : Controller Rinberg speaking. Is that you, Hobson? "
657,"HOBSON: Yes, Rinberg. "
658,RINBERG : The directional fields are showing a progressive error.
659,Reports have come in of wide-spread pressure fluctuations in Atlantic
660,zone 6. You must get the gravitron back into balance. 
661,HOBSON: We're trying to compensate by re-aligning the probe. We have an
662,error in the servos. 
663,"RINBERG : Well, there's no sign of any improvement here. We've just"
664,"had a report from Miami, Florida. Thirty minutes ago they were enjoying"
665,clear skies and a heat wave. Now Hurricane Lucy is right overhead. 
666,BENOIT: There is only one thing to do. 
667,HOBSON: What's that? 
668,BENOIT: Shut it down. 
669,"HOBSON: What, switch the gravitron off?! "
670,"BENOIT: Yes, it's the only chance. "
671,"HOBSON: We can't do that, man. The collapse of the gravity would"
672,"devastate half the globe. There'd be storms, whirlwinds, hurricanes. "
673,RINBERG : I overheard your conversation. It's quite out of the
674,question. You're not to shut down the gravitron under any
675,"circumstances, and that's an order. I think perhaps you don't"
676,appreciate how serious the situation already is. 
677,HOBSON: I bet he gets a knighthood. 
678,RINBERG : We spent years in a general assembly negotiating methods
679,of agreement between farmers and landowners and so on. Now the
680,"weather's out of control they're after our blood, and I must say I"
681,"can't blame them. You've got to get that thing under control, quickly."
682,Now please get on with it. 
683,"CONTROL : Earth control, over and out. "
684,"HOBSON: Well, you're all in the picture. We've got trouble, bad"
685,"trouble, we haven't got much time. We're going to run through every"
686,"circuit, every field pattern, every damn nut and bolt on Charlie boy in"
687,"there until he's running sweet and smooth. A full class A test, in"
688,fact. Now you all know what to do so let's get on with it. 
689,"MEN: Okay, Chief. "
690,"HOBSON: Right, we'll start on the main tape programme. "
691,BENOIT: Right. 
692,[Computer room]
693,
694,"(A proper computer bank, with turning magnetic"
695,tapes and stuff.) 
696,NILS: It's running now. 
697,"HOBSON: Right, give me the analogue value on module 6, will you? "
698,BENOIT: Will do. They look all right. A at 10 millivolts. B at 15
699,"millivolts, C at 26. That fits, doesn't it? "
700,"HOBSON: Yes, they're at normal levels. Roger, finish checking here,"
701,will you? The answer may be in the control panel. 
702,"BENOIT: Okay. I'll sing out the binary conversion values, you check"
703,"them on read out, okay? "
704,NILS: Right. 
705,BENOIT: Right. 
706,(The Doctor has stuck in and is taking samples of fibres from Benoit's
707,shirt.) 
708,BENOIT: Channel one. 
709,NILS: Jah. 
710,BENOIT: Eight. 
711,NILS: Right. 
712,BENOIT: One. 
713,NILS: Mm-hm. 
714,BENOIT: Three. 
715,NILS: Jah. 
716,BENOIT: Four. 
717,(The Doctor starts plucking at Benoit's trouser leg.) 
718,NILS: Jah. 
719,BENOIT: Six. 
720,NILS: Right. 
721,BENOIT: Eight. 
722,NILS: Right. 
723,BENOIT: Twelve. 
724,NILS: Jah. 
725,BENOIT: Right? 
726,NILS: Right. All spot on. 
727,BENOIT: Right. 
728,(Benoit notices the Doctor and turns on him.) 
729,"BENOIT: Eh là, qu'est-ce que vous fabriquez ici, imbécile d'idiot ! Vous"
730,n'avez rien d'autre à faire ? Vous croyez que nous sommes en train de
731,"nous amuser ? Oh, come on. Get out of the way. "
732,"DOCTOR: Enchanté, Monsieur. "
733,[Control room]
734,
735,"BENOIT: Now, where were we? Ah, yes, the fluid"
736,servo pressures. I reckon this is probably where the fault is. 
737,"NILS: Er, do you want them all or just the main tank readings? "
738,BENOIT: The main will do. 
739,"NILS: Right. Header one, 45 pounds. "
740,BENOIT: Yes. 
741,"NILS: Header two, 47 "
742,BENOIT: Yes. 
743,"NILS: Three, 42. "
744,(The Doctor starts unfastening Nils' bootlaces.) 
745,BENOIT: Yes. 
746,NILS: Sine values equivalent. 
747,BENOIT: They all fit. Nothing there. 
748,"NILS: It must be the potentiometer net, then. "
749,BENOIT: Looks like it. Take us some time to do that. We'll need the
750,digital voltmeter. 
751,"NILS: Right, I'll get it. "
752,(Nils steps out of his boot.) 
753,HOBSON: What the blazes are you doing? 
754,DOCTOR: I'm just collecting specimens. 
755,"HOBSON: Specimens? Oh, yes. Well, get on with it."
756,
757, [Sickbay]
758,
759,BEN: We're nearly out of this interferon stuff. 
760,POLLY: Oh. Well you'd better go and ask Mister Hobson where the rest
761,is. 
762,"BEN: Yeah, right. "
763,(Ben leaves. Jamie groans.) 
764,"POLLY: Shh. It's all right, Jamie, it's all right. You're going to get"
765,better but you must lie still. 
766,"JAMIE: Oh, what is this place? Is it the home of the piper? "
767,"POLLY: No, we're on the moon. You know, the moon, up in the sky. "
768,"JAMIE: Oh no, I can't be alive. I've just seen the piper. "
769,(Jamie sits up. The cyberman is standing there. Polly tries to get away
770,but it fires an electric sounding charge at her head and she
771,collapses.) 
772,JAMIE: The piper! I knew! 
773,(The cyberman shocks Jamie unconscious then carries off the man in the
774,next bed. The Doctor enters with his tray of samples.) 
775,DOCTOR: Polly! What's happened? Polly. Are you all right? 
776, [Control room]
777,
778,(The place is a hive of activity.) 
779,HOBSON: Anything out on the probe's servos? 
780,"BENOIT: The error detectors show a slight discrepancy, in normal"
781,"limits, though. "
782,HOBSON: What about the overall feedback valve? We haven't checked that.
783,
784,"BENOIT: No, that's an idea. "
785,"HOBSON: You know, I don't think it's likely to be a mechanical fault. "
786,"JOE: Mister Hobson, an air pressure drop again. "
787,HOBSON: Same as before? 
788,"JOE: Yes, just the same. Lasts about five seconds. "
789,"HOBSON: Something's odd. It's not the pumps, I'm sure of that. Has"
790,anyone asked permission to leave the base? 
791,"JOE: No. As far as I know, the compression chamber's empty. "
792,HOBSON: If I find anybody's been fooling about in there without
793,"permission, I'll tear their hides off."

803,"JOE: The pressure's up again now, sir. "
804,HOBSON: Thank heaven for that. I'm going to check over the control loop
805,monitor. 
806,BENOIT: Control loop monitor? Huh. I think you're wasting your time. 
807,"HOBSON: Nothing's a waste of time till we trace this fault, and don't"
808,you forget it! You saw what's happening on Earth. We can't afford to
809,miss anything. Now get on with it! 
810,SAM: I think I've found something! 
811,HOBSON: What is it? 
812,SAM: One of the probe control antennae. 
813,"BENOIT: Well, what's the matter with it? "
814,"SAM: Well, according to these readings there are at least two pieces of"
815,it missing. It's just not coordinating. 
816,HOBSON: Missing? 
817,BENOIT: Meteorites? 
818,"HOBSON: Could be. There could be a simpler explanation. Roger, when did"
819,these people arrive here? 
820,BENOIT: The end of period 11 in this present lunar day. 
821,HOBSON: And when did the gravitron start playing up? 
822,BENOIT: About the beginning of period 12. 
823,"HOBSON: Sam, when was the last time we had anyone outside? "
824,SAM: During period 13. Two men went outside to realign one of the solar
825,mirrors. 
826,HOBSON: That's it. 
827,BENOIT: I'm not quite with you. 
828,"HOBSON: Well, it's simple. Strangers arrive period 11, the gravitron"
829,goes up the spout period 12. 
830,BENOIT: I understand. But it can't 
831,HOBSON: Come on. It's time we put that Doctor and his friend in cold
832,"storage. Just a second. Get two men outside to look at the antennae,"
833,"will you, Sam? "
834,"SAM: Okay. Right, Joe, nip along to the mess deck, tell Jules and Franz"
835,I want them here pretty sharpish. 
836,JOE: Right.

850,DOCTOR: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. 
851,POLLY: Isn't there any clue at all? 
852,DOCTOR: No. It's a complete blank. All the tests are negative. As far
853,as I can see this whole ridiculous place is completely sterile. 
854,"POLLY: We'll have to go and tell Mister Hobson, I suppose. "
855,DOCTOR: He's not going to like it very much. I simply don't understand
856,it. 
857,"POLLY: Doctor, it wouldn't, I mean it couldn't possibly have anything"
858,"to do with Lister, could it? "
859,DOCTOR: Lister? 
860,"POLLY: Well, I mean, you did say that you took your degree in Glasgow"
861,"in 1888. It does seem an awful long time from now, 2070 or whatever it"
862,is. 
863,"DOCTOR: Polly, are you suggesting that I'm not competent to carry out"
864,these tests? 
865,"POLLY: Oh, no. No, no, no, no. I was just wondering if there was"
866,anything that Joseph Lister didn't know in 1888 that might possibly
867,help you now.

869,Ours. Look busy. Quick! 
870,(Hobson and Ben enter.) 
871,"HOBSON: That's as might be, but that's the third person to disappear in"

876,DOCTOR: Would you mind standing away from the door and allowing it to
877,"close? The slides, the dust. "
878,HOBSON: Okay. It must be you people. We've got some straight talking to
879,"do, you and I. "
880,DOCTOR: Polly. 
881,POLLY: Yes? 
882,DOCTOR: Another boot. 
883,POLLY: Right. 
884,HOBSON: Do you hear me? 
885,DOCTOR: This is extraordinary. 
886,"POLLY: Excuse me, please. "
887,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
888,HOBSON: Now look here. 
889,"DOCTOR: Excuse me, please. We are trying to help you, you know. "
890,HOBSON: Help? Is that what you call it? You can all get off the moon
891,now. 
892,"POLLY: Now, wait a minute, you said "
893,HOBSON: I don't care what I said. 
894,DOCTOR: Ah! 
895,HOBSON: Found something? 
896,DOCTOR: I think perhaps I have. 
897,HOBSON: Really? 
898,"DOCTOR: Yes, I may be onto something, but I must have some room. How"
899,"can I work under these conditions? Now out, please! Come along,"
900,"outside. I'm trying to work in here! Ben, see that they stay outside. "
901,(The Moonbase personnel are hustled out.) 
902,"POLLY: Doctor, did you mean that? "
903,DOCTOR: What? 
904,POLLY: You've found something. 
905,"DOCTOR: Oh, Polly, I only wish I had. Why not make some coffee to keep"
906,them all happy while I think of something? 
907,POLLY: All right.

911,"two shadows loom over them. The cybermen club them to ground, knocking"
912,them out.)

915,
916,(The Doctor comes out of sickbay.) 
917,"HOBSON: Here, Doctor. You've completed your examination? "
918,"DOCTOR: Yes, just about. "
919,"HOBSON: Turned the base upside down, poked into everything? "
920,"DOCTOR: Yes, clothes, boots, food. "
921,HOBSON: And you've found? 
922,DOCTOR: Absolutely nothing. 
923,HOBSON: Just as I thought. 
924,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. "
925,HOBSON: So what I told you still stands. 
926,(Polly brings a tray.) 
927,"DOCTOR: Ah, coffee. Splendid. Thank you, Polly. I think we could all do"
928,with a cup. 
929,"HOBSON: Benoit, you'd better go outside and see how Jules and Franz are"
930,getting on. 
931,BENOIT: Right.

941,"HOBSON: Well, Doctor."
942,POLLY: Sugar? 
943,"HOBSON: Oh, thank you. "
944,"POLLY: It's very hot. Doctor, what about you? "
945,"DOCTOR: Thank you, Polly. "
946,"HOBSON: Well, Doctor, as I was saying, you've had your chance and"
947,you've come up with absolutely nothing. Now I want 
948,(Number 15 has just taken a mouthful of coffee when he groans and
949,collapses.) 
950,DOCTOR: Don't touch him! Let me look. 
951,(Black lines spread quickly across the man's skin.) 
952,"HOBSON: Here, Charlie and you, what's your name, Ben, give us a hand to"
953,get him into the medical unit. 
954,DOCTOR: Try not to touch his skin. 
955,(The stricken man is carried away.) 
956,DOCTOR: Don't drink that! 
957,HOBSON: What the hell? 
958,DOCTOR: It's the sugar! Don't you see? That's why the disease doesn't
959,"affect everyone. It's the sugar. Not everyone takes it. No, don't touch"
960,it. 
961,(The Doctor uses forceps to pick up the sugar dispenser.) 
962,[Sickbay]
963,
964,(The Doctor pours some sugar onto a microscope
965,slide.) 
966,HOBSON: What are you doing? 
967,DOCTOR: Just be patient. Just as I thought. A large neurotropic virus. 
968,"HOBSON: What, like the space plague? "
969,"DOCTOR: No. It's a large, infective agent that only attacks the nerves."
970,That's why the patients have got these lines on their faces and their
971,hands. It follows the course of the nerves under the skin. 
972,"HOBSON: That's all very well, but how did it get in here? "
973,"DOCTOR: Oh, it is the Cybermen. I believe they have deliberately"
974,infected the base. 
975,HOBSON: My men have searched every square inch of the base. There's no
976,"space to hide a cat, let alone a Cyberman! Anyhow, how did they get in?"
977,
978,DOCTOR: One moment. 
979,HOBSON: What is it? 
980,DOCTOR: You say you searched all the base? 
981,HOBSON: Yes. What of it? 
982,DOCTOR: Every nook and cranny? 
983,HOBSON: Yes. 
984,DOCTOR: No chance of anyone hiding anywhere? 
985,HOBSON: None whatever. 
986,DOCTOR: Did your men search in here? 
987,HOBSON: Well 
988,DOCTOR: Did they? 
989,"HOBSON: Well, there were always people in here, so they probably "
990,DOCTOR: Did they search in here? 
991,HOBSON: No! 
992,POLLY: But there's nowhere in here they could hide. 
993,(The Doctor round sickbay until they come to a bed where a body is
994,"covered by a blanket, but large silver boots are sticking out.) "

1001,
1002, [Sickbay]   
1003,CYBERMAN 1: Stand back. Stand back from that door. 
1004,(It is a much more mechanical voice than the last time we met them.) 
1005,HOBSON: You're right. It is them. 
1006,(Bob rushes to the cyberman with a metal bar.) 
1007,HOBSON: Quick! Get out of here! 
1008,(A second cyberman appears and fires his weapon.) 
1009,DOCTOR: No! 
1010,"(Bob falls, smoke coming from his body.) "
1011,CYBERMAN 1: Remain still. 
1012,HOBSON: You devils. You killed him! An unarmed man. 
1013,CYBERMAN 1: Get up. See that they remain there. 
1014,CYBERMAN 2: Yes. 
1015,(Cyberman 1 uses the transmitter on his chest to contact their ship.) 
1016,CYBERMAN 1: Operational system two now complete. Operational system two
1017,now complete.
1018,
1019, [Space ship]
1020,
1021,CYBERMAN 1 : Ready to start Operational system
1022,three 
1023,CYBERMAN 3: Understood. Operational system three will now begin.
1024,
1025, [Sickbay]
1026,
1027,CYBERMAN 1: You are known to us. 
1028,DOCTOR: And you to me. 
1029,CYBERMAN 1: Silence. Who is in command? 
1030,HOBSON: I am. 
1031,CYBERMAN 1: You will be needed. 
1032,HOBSON: What have you done with my men? 
1033,CYBERMAN 1: They will return. 
1034,HOBSON: They're not dead? 
1035,CYBERMAN 1: No. They are not dead. They are altered. 
1036,BEN: Altered? What have you done to them? 
1037,CYBERMAN 1: They are now controlled. 
1038,HOBSON: If you do anything to my 
1039,CYBERMAN 1: You will do nothing. 
1040,(The second cyberman examines the patients and then gets to Jamie.) 
1041,CYBERMAN 2: This one has not received neurotrope X. Stand back. 
1042,"POLLY: Please, leave him alone. His head is hurt. He's had an accident."
1043,
1044,CYBERMAN 2: His head? Then he would be of no value. The others are
1045,ready for conversion. 
1046,CYBERMAN 1: You will now take us to the control centre. 
1047,HOBSON: I'll be damned if 
1048,(The cyberman points his weapon at Hobson.) 
1049,HOBSON: It's through here. 
1050,"(Hobson, the cyberman and the Doctor leave.) "
1051,CYBERMAN 2: You will remain here. If you leave you will be converted
1052,like the others. 
1053,(That cyberman leaves.) 
1054,BEN: I don't like that word converted.
1055,
1056, [Space ship]
1057,
1058,"(Doctor Evans, Franz and Ralph are being converted."
1059,They are all fitted with a metal headpiece.) 
1060,CYBERMAN 3: Raise your left arm. 
1061,(The three men lift their left arms.) 
1062,CYBERMAN 3: Raise your right arm. 
1063,CYBERMAN 4: Control is excellent. Transfer that one to the capsule. 
1064,(Two cybermen wheel in a man-sized canister. Evans is locked inside
1065,it.)
1066,
1067, [Control room]
1068,
1069,BENOIT: It's about time that we heard from those
1070,two outside. Let's have a word with them. 
1071,"NILS: All yours, Roger. "
1072,"BENOIT: Surface party, come in please. Surface party, come in please."
1073,"Surface party, come in. We are not receiving you. Over. Can we see the"
1074,control antenna from here? 
1075,"NILS: No, Roger. It's just around that first block outside the main"
1076,port. 
1077,"BENOIT: Well, we'll have to send someone else out so get ready to "
1078,(Hobson enters.) 
1079,HOBSON: Get back! Get back! These things are lethal. 
1080,CYBERMAN 1: No one will move. You will remain still. If you move you
1081,will be killed. 
1082,BENOIT: What are they? How did they get in? 
1083,CYBERMAN 1: Silence. We are Cybermen. You will listen. 
1084,BENOIT: But you were all killed! 
1085,CYBERMAN 1: We are going to take over the Gravitron and use it to
1086,destroy the surface of the Earth by changing the weather. 
1087,DOCTOR: But that will kill everybody on the Earth. 
1088,CYBERMAN 1: Yes. 
1089,HOBSON: You're supposed to be so advanced. Here you are taking your
1090,"revenge like, like children. "
1091,CYBERMAN 1: Revenge? What is that? 
1092,HOBSON: A feeling people have when 
1093,"CYBERMAN 1: Feelings? Feelings? Yes, we know of this weakness of yours."
1094,We are fortunate. We do not posses feelings. 
1095,BENOIT: Then why are you here? 
1096,CYBERMAN 1: To eliminate all dangers. 
1097,HOBSON: But you'll kill every living thing on the Earth. 
1098,CYBERMAN 1: Yes. All dangers will be eliminated. 
1099,BENOIT: Have you no mercy? 
1100,CYBERMAN 1: It is unnecessary. Keep watch on them. 
1101,(Cyberman 1 moves away to activate his communicator.) 
1102,"HOBSON: Don't rush him, Nils. "
1103,CYBERMAN 1: Operational system four. Operation system four. 
1104,CYBERMAN 3 : Operational system four complete. Entry to base now
1105,completed. 
1106,HOBSON: Entry? How did you get in? 
1107,CYBERMAN 1: It was very simple. Only stupid Earth brains like yours
1108,would have been fooled. 
1109,HOBSON: Go on. 
1110,"CYBERMAN 1: Since we couldn't approach direct, we came up under the"
1111,"surface and cut our way in through your store room, contaminating your"
1112,"food supply on the way. A simple hole, that's all. "
1113,HOBSON: A hole! That explains those sudden air pressure drops we've
1114,been recording. 
1115,CYBERMAN 1: Clever. Clever. Clever. 
1116, [Sickbay]
1117,
1118,(Polly is looking at her battered finger nails as
1119,Jamie tries to get out of bed.) 
1120,"POLLY: Hey, what do you think you're doing? You seem to be better. "
1121,"JAMIE: Aye, I feel myself again. "
1122,POLLY: Lie back there. 
1123,"JAMIE: But I'm better! Oh, my head. "
1124,"BEN: Yeah, well take it easy, mate. "
1125,"POLLY: At least, you know it's not your McCrimmon piper, anyway. "
1126,"JAMIE: It had me worried though, I admit that. "
1127,"BEN: Yeah, those Cybermen have got us all worried, mate. We've see them"
1128,in action before. 
1129,POLLY: They must have some weakness. 
1130,"BEN: They have, don't you remember? They can't stand radiation. "
1131,POLLY: But where do we find that here? 
1132,BEN: There's the Gravitron power pack but that's thermonuclear. No one
1133,can get near it once its going. 
1134,POLLY: Why not? 
1135,"BEN: Well because Duchess, the temperature inside is about four million"
1136,"degrees, that's all. "
1137,"JAMIE: Well, in my day, they used to sprinkle witches with holy water. "
1138,BEN: Fat lot of use that would be on them. 
1139,POLLY: Sprinkle. Holy Water. Ben? 
1140,BEN: Yeah? 
1141,POLLY: What are the Cybermen covered in? 
1142,"BEN: As far as I know, their suit is a metal of some sort. "
1143,"POLLY: Oh. What about that thing on their chests? You know, the part"
1144,which replaces their heart and lungs. 
1145,"BEN: Some kind of plastic, I think. "
1146,"POLLY: I thought so. You see, it's simple. Nail varnish remover"
1147,dissolves nail varnish. Nail varnish is a plastic. So we do what Jamie
1148,"says. We sprinkle them, see? "
1149,"BEN: No, I don't. Clear as mud if you ask me. "
1150,"POLLY: Well anyway, I'm going to try an experiment. "
1151,"BEN: Yes, Professor."
1152,
1153, [Control room]
1154,
1155,"(Ralph, Evans and Jules enter, followed by a"
1156,cyberman.) 
1157,HOBSON: Jules! Doctor Evans! I thought he was all dead. I thought they
1158,were all dead. 
1159,BENOIT: Better if they were by the look of it. 
1160,CYBERMAN 1: You will leave your places. Go over there. 
1161,(The technicians go to stand by the wall. It speaks to Hobson and
1162,Benoit.) 
1163,CYBERMAN 1: You will move. Tell the operators in the power unit to come
1164,out. Now. 
1165,"HOBSON: All right, you can all see what's happening. Come out. Leave"
1166,the machine and don't try anything. 
1167,(The power control crew enter the control room.) 
1168,CYBERMAN 1: They will now take over the Gravitron power unit. 
1169,CYBERMAN 2: Yes. 
1170,(The converted men file into the power room.) 
1171,BENOIT: But you can't send them in there without the protective
1172,helmets. 
1173,CYBERMAN 1: Why? 
1174,BENOIT: The machine produces very intense sonic fields. Without the
1175,"helmets, those men will be insane in a few hours. "
1176,CYBERMAN 1: How many hours? 
1177,"BENOIT: Twelve, possibly. "
1178,CYBERMAN 1: Then there is no problem. 
1179,BENOIT: Why? 
1180,CYBERMAN 1: Our purpose will be achieved before that. 
1181,BENOIT: But what about the men? 
1182,CYBERMAN 1: They will be disposed of. 
1183,(The Doctor has been watching the cybermen carefully. He edges over to
1184,"the R/T unit and turns up the volume, then resets it when a cyberman"
1185,turns.)
1186,
1187, [Sickbay]
1188,
1189,(Polly has collected lots of bottles.) 
1190,POLLY: Ben? 
1191,BEN: Yeah? 
1192,POLLY: What is nail varnish remover? 
1193,"BEN: It's a sort of thinner, something like acetone I think. "
1194,"POLLY: Acetone, of course. Great, we've got some of that. Now, keep"
1195,your fingers crossed. 
1196,(Polly drops some plastic into the acetone and watches it dissolve.) 
1197,POLLY: It's works! 
1198,BEN: But I still don't know what you're on about. 
1199,"POLLY: If we can sprinkle some of that on their chest units, it might"
1200,help to soften them. 
1201,BEN: I get it! You mean it'll clobber their controls or something. 
1202,"POLLY: Yes, that's it. "
1203,"BEN: Yeah, but how do we know that acetone will dissolve their sort of"
1204,plastic? 
1205,POLLY: I hadn't thought of that. 
1206,"BEN: Just a moment though, if we make up a mixture. "
1207,POLLY: Of all the solvents. 
1208,BEN: What have we got? 
1209,"POLLY: Benzene, ether, alcohol. "
1210,BEN: We brew a right old cocktail. 
1211,"POLLY: Yes. Wait a minute, how are we going to throw it at them? "
1212,"BEN: Well, in bottles, I suppose. Now just a tick though. I've got a"
1213,better idea.
1214,
1215, [Control room]
1216,
1217,CYBERMAN 1: Prepare to align the field rectors. 
1218,(The controlled humans obey.) 
1219,CYBERMAN 1: Main power into vortex generators now. Servo pumps to full
1220,pressure. 
1221,HOBSON: Why did they go to so such trouble? 
1222,DOCTOR: What do you mean? 
1223,HOBSON: Why didn't they operate the controls themselves? 
1224,(The Doctor goes back to the R/T unit and adjusts the volume and pitch
1225,once more. The controlled men lose coordination.) 
1226,CYBERMAN 1: What is happening? 
1227,CYBERMAN 2: There is loss of control. 
1228,DOCTOR: (sotto) Thought so. Sonic control. That should be easy. 
1229,(He resets the dials.) 
1230,DOCTOR: (sotto) Funny. Funny. Go to all that trouble to make the men do
1231,"the work. Why? Do it themselves, easy. They're using the men as tools."
1232,"Why? Don't know. Yes, I do though. There must be something in here they"
1233,don't like. Pressure? Electricity? Radiation? Maybe. Gravity! Now
1234,"there's a thought. Gravity. Oh, yes. Gravity. "
1235,CYBERMAN 1: Start probe generators. Realign the probe. Probe field to
1236,full power now. 
1237,HOBSON: They'll devastate the whole Earth when that field takes hold. 
1238,BENOIT: We've got to do something. 
1239,"CONTROL : Earth Control calling Moonbase. Come in, please. "
1240,CYBERMAN 1: Remain still. 
1241,"CONTROL : Hello, Moonbase. Come in, please. "
1242,CYBERMAN 1: You will all be silent. 
1243,"CONTROL : Moonbase, come in, please. Hello? Reading on five"
1244,centimetre band. Come in. Your last routine signal was not received.
1245,Over. We are not receiving you. Over. If you hear us and cannot
1246,"transmit, fire sodium rocket. We shall see flare. "
1247,CYBERMAN 1: What does that mean? 
1248,HOBSON: It's a distress rocket. It ejects sodium into space and then
1249,the sun lights the sodium into a yellow flare. 
1250,CYBERMAN 1: What will your Earth do if they do not see the flare? 
1251,"HOBSON: Well, they'll think we're all dead. They'll do nothing. "
1252,CONTROL : Standing by to observe flare. Standing by. 
1253,(A cyberman turns the transmitter off. Hobson whispers to Benoit.) 
1254,"HOBSON: If they don't get our next transmission, they'll send up a"
1255,relief rocket.
1256,
1257, [Sickbay]
1258,
1259,"BEN: So, get it? This bottle holds the stuff that"
1260,puts the fire out and this cylinder pushes gas into the bottle so that
1261,"stuff squirts out here. Now, all we've got to do is to undo it. Phoar."
1262,Empty it and fill it with Polly cocktail. 
1263,POLLY: I've got it all ready here. 
1264,BEN: Good. What did you put in it? 
1265,"POLLY: Let's think. Benzene, ether, alcohol, acetone and epoxy-propane."
1266,
1267,"BEN: Blimey, one of them should do it. Now, we'll need another one of"
1268,these. 
1269,"JAMIE: Right, I'll get it. "
1270,"BEN: No, you stay where you are, Jamie. "
1271,"POLLY: Jamie, you're not well enough. "
1272,JAMIE: It takes more than a wee crack on the head to keep a McCrimmon
1273,down. 
1274,"BEN: Look mate, we don't want you cracking up on us. I'm sure Polly's"
1275,very impressed. 
1276,"JAMIE: Look, I said I was better. Would you like me to prove it to you?"
1277,
1278,"BEN: Any time, mate. "
1279,"POLLY: Look, come on. Haven't we got enough trouble without you two"
1280,fighting each other? 
1281,JAMIE: I go. 
1282,"BEN: Oh well, come on then. Not you, Polly. This is men's work."
1283,
1284, [Control room]
1285,
1286,(One of the controlled men collapses.) 
1287,HOBSON: You'll kill them. 
1288,CYBERMAN 2: If you will not remain silent you will be put under brain
1289,control. 
1290,(The cyberman adjusts his control box and the controlled human jumps up
1291,again.)
1292,
1293, [Corridor]
1294,
1295,BEN: Polly. I thought that I told you to stay
1296,behind. 
1297,POLLY: I'm coming with you. 
1298,JAMIE: You'll maybe get hurt. Now go back. 
1299,POLLY: I'm coming with you and that's flat! You still need someone to
1300,look after you 
1301,JAMIE: I don't want 
1302,"BEN: There's no time for arguments. If you're coming, come on. "
1303,(They go to the control room door.) 
1304,"BEN: Now look, we've only got one chance. When I open the door, drop"
1305,"down as low as you can, aim this things at their chests and squirt like"
1306,mad. Right? 
1307,JAMIE: Right. 
1308,BEN: Now get ready.
1309,
1310, [Control room]
1311,
1312,(A cyberman hears something outside.) 
1313,CYBERMAN 2: Someone is there. 
1314,(A high pitched noise makes the controlled men freeze.)

1316,"(The cybermen turn on the Doctor as Ben, Jamie and Polly burst into the"
1317,room) 
1318,"BEN: Quickly, go and get their chest things! "
1319,"(They spray the cybermen's chest units, which instantly bubble and"
1320,"dissolve. Clutching helplessly at their chests, the cybermen collapse.)"
1321,
1322,"DOCTOR: Quick, get these things off their heads! "
1323,"(Ben, Jamie and Polly go into the gravitron room and removed the men's"
1324,metal helmets. The men pass out.) 
1325,"HOBSON: Come on, get to your places! Quick, there's not a moment to"
1326,lose. We've got to get the Gravitron down to safe level. 
1327,POLLY: What about those poor men? 
1328,"HOBSON: Shift them along to the medical unit, quick as you can."

1332,CYBERLEADER: We are not receiving you. We are not
1333,receiving you. 
1334,CYBERMAN 4: They must have failed. 
1335,CYBERLEADER: Yes. We must invade now. Prepare the weapons. 
1336,CYBERMAN 4: Yes.

1338, [Control room]
1339,
1340,"BENOIT: Before all this, we lost contact with those"
1341,two men outside. 
1342,"HOBSON: Well, send someone else out. "
1343,BENOIT: Can't spare anyone. I'll go myself. 
1344,"HOBSON: Field strength is stable, isn't it? "
1345,"BENOIT: Yes. Yes, it's all right. "
1346,HOBSON: Keep in R/T contract and be quick. 
1347,BENOIT: Right. 
1348,HOBSON: Nils? 
1349,NILS: Jah? 
1350,"HOBSON: Hook your controls into Joe's channel, then get up into the"
1351,dome and keep a eye on Roger when he's outside. 
1352,NILS: Right. 
1353,[Lunar surface]
1354,
1355,(By the antennae.) 
1356,"BENOIT: Hello Base, Hello Base. I've found them. At least, I've found"
1357,"their suits. They got them, I'm afraid."
1358,
1359, [Control room]
1360,
1361,"HOBSON: Well, there's nothing we can do about that"
1362,now. You'd better come inside as quick as you can. 
1363,BENOIT : I will. 
1364,"NILS: Sir, sir! There's one of those things outside. He's after Roger"
1365,Benoit. 
1366,"HOBSON: You hear that, Roger?"
1367,
1368,[Lunar surface]
1369,
1370,"BENOIT: Yes, I did, but he must be mistaken."
1371,There's none to be seen around here. 
1372,(A cyberman appears and draws its weapon.) 
1373,BENOIT: No! No! 
1374,"(The cyberman fires his weapon, but nothing happens.) "
1375,BENOIT: Did you see that? Those things don't work in the vacuum!
1376,
1377, [Control room]
1378,
1379,(Ben is dismantling a fire extinguisher.) 
1380,POLLY: Why can't you squirt it at them like you did just now? 
1381,"BEN: Because duchess, it would evaporate in the vacuum before it hits"
1382,"them. There, now come on. "
1383,"(Taking the glass cylinder full of solvent mix, Ben runs out. Outside,"
1384,"the cyberman chases Benoit, gaining on him all the time. At the"
1385,"airlock, Ben gets into a spacesuit. Benoit approaches the entry door.)"
1386,
1387,[Airlock]
1388,
1389,(Ben exits the airlock as Benoit enters. Ben throws
1390,"the glass cylinder at the cyberman's chest unit. It breaks, covering"
1391,him in a cloud of vapour.) 
1392,"BEN: Come on, quick. "
1393,"(Ben gets back in with Benoit and they close the outer doors. Outside,"
1394,"the cyberman flails around as it's chest unit dissolves. In the vacuum,"
1395,no one can hear it scream.)
1396,
1397, [Control room]
1398,
1399,NILS: They're in! That fellow Ben got one of them. 
1400,JAMIE: That was Ben? 
1401,"HOBSON: Now listen, everybody. I don't know how many more of these"
1402,"Cybermen there are, but our point of view we're under siege. I'll"
1403,"reckon they will be back in a bit. Now, communications. Charlie, keep"
1404,trying to get through to Earth. Right? 
1405,"CHARLIE: Right, will do. "
1406,"HOBSON: The rest of you, lower the armoured doors at all exits. And"
1407,"you, make up as much of that gubbins as you've got. We may need it. "
1408,"(Ben enters, with Benoit leaning on him.) "
1409,"DOCTOR: Well done, Ben! "
1410,JAMIE: Well done. 
1411,HOBSON: Ground radar? 
1412,SAM : Ground radar speaking. 
1413,HOBSON: Have you got a fix on their ship yet? 
1414,"SAM : Yes, Mister Hobson. We're getting a strong pulse from five"
1415,four degrees north about three kilometres. 
1416,HOBSON: That makes it just over the rim. 
1417,"DOCTOR: Mister Hobson, how far can the probe be lowered down? "
1418,HOBSON: About thirty degrees. 
1419,DOCTOR: That's no good. 
1420,HOBSON: What do you mean? 
1421,DOCTOR: Can any other part of it be lowered? 
1422,"HOBSON: Well, the main coil lenses can be shifted round without too"
1423,"much trouble, but why do you want to do "
1424,"NILS: There's something outside, sir! "
1425,HOBSON: What is it? 
1426,NILS: It's a long way off. 
1427,HOBSON: I'll come. 
1428,[Observation dome]
1429,
1430,"POLLY: Oh, it's freezing. Do you think we should"
1431,have our suits on? 
1432,"BEN: Oh, no, it's all right love. Get a gorgeous suntan. "
1433,(Hobson looks through the telescope.) 
1434,HOBSON: Can't see anything. 
1435,NILS: Just to the left of the launching area. Round a bit to your left.
1436,
1437,HOBSON: Still can't see anything. 
1438,"BENOIT: (pointing) No, it's there, look! Reflections in the sun. "
1439,"HOBSON: You're right, there is something. "
1440,(Two rows of cybermen march over the crater rim.)

1447,gravitron probe.) 
1448,"DOCTOR: They can't just march in here, can they? "
1449,HOBSON: Not now we've discovered how they got in. 
1450,DOCTOR: Oh yes. They tunnelled into the store room. 
1451,"JAMIE: Doctor, Mister Hobson, come quickly. "
1452,HOBSON: What is it? 
1453,[Control room]
1454,
1455,CYBERLEADER : Moonbase. Moonbase. 
1456,NILS: They've got our wavelength. We hear you. 
1457,CYBERLEADER : You are surrounded. All resistance is useless. You
1458,must open the entry port. 
1459,HOBSON: Let me. You're wasting your time. We've discovered your
1460,passageway and blocked it. You cannot enter now. 
1461,CYBERLEADER : Resistance is useless. 
1462,(Hobson turns the radio off.) 
1463,POLLY: Can they get in? 
1464,HOBSON: I don't know and I'm not stopping to find out. Get me Earth as
1465,quick as you can. 
1466,"NILS: Right. Weather Control Moon calling Earth. Come in, please. "
1467,(Loud static hurts everyone's ears.) 
1468,JAMIE: What's that? 
1469,HOBSON: Switch that off. 
1470,POLLY: What's that terrible noise? 
1471,BEN: It wasn't like that before. 
1472,HOBSON: We'll never hear anything through that if they're jamming it. 
1473,"BENOIT: Perhaps, or could it be. "
1474,HOBSON: The aerial. They're having a go at the aerial. 
1475,BENOIT: Where are you going? 
1476,HOBSON: Out. 
1477,BENOIT: You're crazy. They'd get you in a flash. 
1478,"HOBSON: Well, someone's got to go. "
1479,DOCTOR: It's too late. Come and see. 
1480,[Observation dome]
1481,
1482,(Through the telescope we see two cybermen
1483,destroying the antennae.) 
1484,"HOBSON: They get us every way, these creatures. "
1485,DOCTOR: I refuse to believe that. Everything's got a weak point. It's
1486,"just a question of waiting until it shows up, that's all. "
1487,[Control room]
1488,
1489,BENOIT: They're bound to send a relief rocket
1490,"within 12 hours, if no signals are received from us. "
1491,BEN: A lot of good that is. 
1492,"NILS: Well, with all the trouble we've been giving them I'd say it's"
1493,"certain the rocket is on its way, sent off hours ago. Rinberg's very"
1494,"quick off the trigger, right, Hobby? "
1495,"HOBSON: I'm sure of it. With a replacement for me aboard, no doubt. "
1496,POLLY: But that's wonderful! 
1497,HOBSON: Thanks very much. 
1498,"POLLY: No, what I mean is, what are we all worrying about? The Cybermen"
1499,can't get in and help is on its way. 
1500,"BEN: Ah, it all sounds too easy for my liking. "
1501,HOBSON: Get the scanner lined up on the flight path between moon and
1502,Earth. Let me know the moment you spot anything. 
1503,NILS: Right. 
1504,"HOBSON: All we have to do, Doctor, is to hold on here. "
1505,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's all. It doesn't depend on us, though. "
1506,BEN: What do you mean? 
1507,DOCTOR: It depends on what the Cybermen are hatching up. If a rocket is
1508,"on it's way, they're bound to be aware of that already."
1509,
1510, [Space ship]
1511,
1512,CYBERLEADER: Emergency. Emergency. There is a
1513,spaceship approaching from Earth. It will arrive on the lunar surface
1514,in 15 minutes. Immediate offensive action must be taken.

1548,NILS: Without an aerial? 
1549,BENOIT: We can pick up local signals. 
1550,"NILS: Local? Oh I see, the Cybermen. "

1552,hear them.

1561,"BENOIT: That is correct, but watch the digital counter. "
1562,BEN: Right. 
1563,HOBSON: How's he shaping? 
1564,"BENOIT: Not bad for a beginner, I suppose, but it will take a long time"
1565,yet. 
1566,"HOBSON: Well, at least the gravitron's stable at the moment. I don't"
1567,know how they can take it for long in that room. 
1568,BENOIT: How's Benson standing up to it? 
1569,HOBSON: He's 
1570,BENOIT: He's been on for 6 hours on the trot. 
1571,HOBSON: He says he'll be all right for the time being. 
1572,"BENOIT: Yes I know, but should he be on it alone? "
1573,HOBSON: Who else have we got? You're the only other operator who could
1574,replace him and you're needed right here. 
1575,"BENOIT: Well, it's a bit tough on him, isn't it? "
1576,"HOBSON: I know, Roger. It's tough on all of us but the lives of"
1577,millions of people depend on this weather control unit. 
1578,POLLY: Here we are. I've brought us all some coffee to keep us awake. 
1579,"BEN: Without sugar this time, I hope. "
1580,POLLY: Of course. Don't remind me.

1596,BEN: Doctor! They've spotted it on the scanner. 
1597,DOCTOR: What? 
1598,BEN: The relief ship. 
1599,"POLLY: Ben, where? "
1600,BEN: Over here. 
1601,DOCTOR: Let's see. 
1602,HOBSON: Well? 
1603,NILS: No doubt about it. I told you they would be on their way. 
1604,POLLY: That's a spaceship? 
1605,"BEN: No, that's the scanner. "
1606,DOCTOR: It's not far off. 
1607,HOBSON: Far off? It's coming in now off parking orbit. It'll be down in
1608,six minutes. 
1609,"POLLY: Well, don't you think you ought to warn them? "
1610,"BEN: Yeah, the Cybermen will be waiting for them. "
1611,"HOBSON: Don't worry, they've got their own warning system and weapons."

1616,(The blip carries on to the other side of the screen.) 
1617,BENOIT: What are they doing? 
1618,JAMIE: Looks like they've changed direction. 
1619,HOBSON: They've changed into an escape orbit. Follow it. 
1620,NILS: But it's going too fast. I can't keep up with it. 
1621,"HOBSON: Well, keep trying. "
1622,NILS: I can't hold it. It's accelerating too fast. 
1623,(The screen goes white.) 
1624,"BENOIT: Look out, man. You're on the sun. "
1625,NILS: But that's where it's heading. 
1626,"BENOIT: The acceleration, it's gigantic! "
1627,HOBSON: Get R/T contact with the ship. 
1628,"NILS: No good, sir. The Doppler effect. It's going too fast. "
1629,"BENOIT: They've had it, I'm afraid. "
1630,HOBSON: The sun. 
1631,BENOIT: Yes. 
1632,POLLY: Will somebody please tell us what it all means? 
1633,BENOIT: The rocket has been deflected towards the sun. Nothing can save
1634,them now. 
1635,POLLY: Save them? What are you talking about? 
1636,BENOIT: From plunging into the sun. 
1637,BEN: But the sun's millions of miles away. 
1638,BENOIT: Once they get into the sun's gravity belt they can't change
1639,course. It may take a week but they'll end up there just the same. 
1640,HOBSON: What on earth could have caused it? 
1641,"BENOIT: The rocket was deflected off course, but why and how? "
1642,"DOCTOR: Deflected? Yes, of course. The gravitron. "
1643,"HOBSON: Have the Cybermen got a gravity weapon, do you think? "
1644,"DOCTOR: No, they haven't but we have. "
1645,HOBSON: You're not suggesting that 
1646,DOCTOR: There's only one way that rocket could have been deflected into
1647,the sun. From this very room! 
1648,BENOIT: I see what you mean. 
1649,"HOBSON: Of course, the gravitron. Benson, he must "
1650,BENOIT: I told you he'd been on duty too long. 
1651,DOCTOR: If it is Benson. 
1652,(They look through the gravitron control room. Evans turns around.) 
1653,HOBSON: It's Evans! 
1654,BEN: But he was in the medical room! 
1655,DOCTOR: They must have got control of them again. 
1656,BEN: And the other men in there? 
1657,DOCTOR: They may not be affected yet. Get along to the medical room.
1658,Barricade the door with everything you can find. Keep them in there at

1669,"JAMIE: Well, that's all right. We haven't passed"
1670,any of them. 
1671,"BEN: Well, maybe it was only Evans who's been reactivated. "
1672,JAMIE: Aye. We'd better keep watch just here. 
1673,BEN: We could stick that thing against the door 
1674,"JAMIE: It wouldn't hold them for long, I'm thinking. "
1675,"BEN: They're not Cybermen, mate. They're just flesh and blood like us."
1676,"Come on, get hold of the other end. "
1677,(They start to carry the metal table when Jamie drops his end.)

1691,"HOBSON: Evans, can you hear me? Listen, Evans, this"
1692,"is Hobson talking. Evans, you've got to concentrate. Your brain has"
1693,"been altered by the Cybermen. You're being controlled by them, anyhow."
1694,"We've got one or two of those things as well, you know. You can't shoot"
1695,all of us so why not be a good fellow and come out of there. 
1696,BENOIT: What's he doing in there? Look at the field reactors. 
1697,HOBSON: Huh? 
1698,BENOIT: We must get back control soon. He could flood half of Europe if
1699,he keeps the gravitron aligned with spring tides. 
1700,"HOBSON: That settles it, we'll have to rush him. Get those weapons out."
1701,
1702,CYBERLEADER : Resistance is useless. All further ships from Earth
1703,will be deflected. Open the airlock to us. If you do not we shall
1704,destroy the base and you will be eliminated. 
1705,HOBSON: Can you hear me? 
1706,CYBERLEADER : Everything you have said in the past half hour has
1707,been overheard. 
1708,"HOBSON: Well you can hear this too, then. We're not done yet and we'll"
1709,fight you to the last man. You'll never get inside this base. 
1710,CYBERLEADER : We are in it already. 
1711,(There's a bang and everyone clutches their throats and hangs on as the
1712,air rushes out.)

1743,BENOIT: Oui. 
1744,HOBSON: Now!

1754,POLLY: Oh. Well why couldn't we have had those before? 
1755,NILS: And lose all our oxygen? 
1756,"POLLY: Oh, I see. It's so quiet. "
1757,"DOCTOR: Yes, it is, isn't it. The gravitron's stopped! "
1758,(Evans is slumped over the console.) 
1759,"DOCTOR: Quick, before he comes to! Ben, Jamie! "
1760,[Gravitron control room]
1761,
1762,NILS: Joe! 
1763,BEN: We've barricaded the sick bay with half the tables and chairs in
1764,"the base but it won't hold forever, Doctor. "
1765,(The Doctor takes the helmet and control piece off Evans.) 
1766,"DOCTOR: Well done, Ben. Here's another one for you. "
1767,[Control room]
1768,
1769,"JAMIE: What do we do with him, Doctor? "
1770,DOCTOR: That's your problem. Just make sure he doesn't come back here
1771,for a while. 
1772,"BEN: Blimey, I'll be after a job as a copper when I get back to 1966. "
1773,(Ben and Jamie leave with Evans. The Doctor puts the control device
1774,inside his coat.) 
1775,[Observation dome]
1776,
1777,"DOCTOR: Mister Hobson, I've got an idea. "
1778,"HOBSON: Doctor, what do you make of this? "
1779,"DOCTOR: Made by a laser beam, I would think. "
1780,HOBSON: Is there anything known to science the Cybermen haven't got? 
1781,DOCTOR: Well they haven't got a gravitron or they wouldn't be after
1782,yours. 
1783,HOBSON: We'll just have to stand guard in here with their cyberguns. 
1784,"BENOIT: Not much use, I'm afraid. They are getting reinforcements. "
1785,HOBSON: What? 
1786,BENOIT: Looks like another of their spaceships. 
1787,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, there. "
1788,(A classic flying saucer lands.) 
1789,HOBSON: Another one! 
1790,(And a second.) 
1791,CYBERLEADER : We have brought up reinforcements with other weapons.
1792,You have one chance. You must open the entry port. You cannot stop us
1793,now. You will all be completely destroyed. 
1794,"POLLY: What does he mean, other weapons? "
1795,NILS: We'll soon find out. You stay here. I must report this to Mister
1796,Hobson. 
1797,(Nils leaves Polly in charge of the R/T.)
1798,
1799, [Lunar surface]
1800,
1801,(Cybermen are unpacking crates.)
1802,
1803, [Space ship]
1804,
1805,CYBERLEADER: I shall count to ten. If you still
1806,stupidly remain silent. we shall fire. One
1807,
1808, [Observation dome]
1809,
1810,NILS: Hobby! They've got another weapon. They're
1811,going to 
1812,"HOBSON: Yes, I know. There it is. Everybody take cover. Get down, all"
1813,of you! 
1814,(The Doctor stays standing.) 
1815,HOBSON: Doctor! 
1816,DOCTOR: Is the gravitron still switched on? 
1817,HOBSON: Yes. 
1818,DOCTOR: Then I shall certainly stay here.
1819,
1820, [Lunar surface]
1821,
1822,(A group of cybermen aim a weapon at the base.) 
1823,"CYBERLEADER : Nine, ten. Fire. "
1824,"(A beam goes towards the base then 'bounces' off it. For some reason,"
1825,this cyberweapon has recoil. Don't ask. ) 
1826,CYBERLEADER : Again. Fire. 
1827,(Once again the beam bounces off the base.)
1828,
1829, [Observation dome]
1830,
1831,HOBSON: What happened? 
1832,DOCTOR: It just deflected over the dome. 
1833,(The Doctor sways.) 
1834,"BENOIT: Doctor, are you all right? "
1835,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. "
1836,HOBSON: The gravitron deflected it. The force field. 
1837,"DOCTOR: Yes, and that gives me an idea. What are they doing now?"
1838,They're packing it away. 
1839,"HOBSON: What'll they cook up next, I wonder? "
1840,DOCTOR: How far down can this be aimed? 
1841,HOBSON: Down? 
1842,DOCTOR: Can it be brought to bear on the surface of the moon? 
1843,BENOIT: I see! 
1844,"HOBSON: Ah, well, I don't "
1845,DOCTOR: Has it ever been tried? 
1846,"BENOIT: No, but we should try! "
1847,"DOCTOR: With Evans gone, the gravitron is all yours. "
1848,BENOIT: Splendid! Je m'en occupe! 
1849,HOBSON: It can only go to here. Any further down and the field may
1850,affect the base. 
1851,DOCTOR: What does that matter now? 
1852,"HOBSON: Well, I suppose you're right. "
1853,DOCTOR: Get someone to stand by that window and relay instructions
1854,direct to Benoit. 
1855,HOBSON: Right. 
1856,(Benoit puts on a helmet and goes into gravitron control. Polly is by
1857,the window to relay instructions. Thumbs up are sent.) 
1858,HOBSON: He's ready. 
1859,DOCTOR: Start moving the probe down. 
1860,(The message is relayed. The approaching cybermen stop advancing and
1861,spread out. They draw their weapons. Benoit signals that the gravitron
1862,won't go any lower.) 
1863,HOBSON: That's as far as it'll go. 
1864,DOCTOR: What? But it's way over their heads. There's one chance. We'll
1865,try bringing it down by hand. 
1866,HOBSON: Right. 
1867,DOCTOR: Is this still switched off? 
1868,"HOBSON: Yes, it's off. "
1869,DOCTOR: Round the back. 
1870,HOBSON: It won't go. 
1871,"DOCTOR: All your weight, once more. No, it's no use, it won't shift. "
1872,"HOBSON: Ah, stupid of me. Of course it won't. "
1873,DOCTOR: Why? 
1874,"HOBSON: Well, the angular cut out. It's obvious, isn't it. You see,"
1875,there's got to be a safety cut out on the angle of the probe otherwise
1876,"it might affect the whole base. There, that's done it. No, no, no,"
1877,stand back. Benoit can do it now. 
1878,DOCTOR: Polly! 
1879,HOBSON: Switch on! 
1880,"(As the gravitron comes down to level with the moon's surface, the"
1881,"cybermen start to float up and away, followed by their saucers. Big"
1882,cheers from the assembled team.) 
1883,DOCTOR: We did it! 
1884,"HOBSON: Well, that's taken care of the Cybermen. Now then, everybody,"
1885,we've got to get this gravitron in operation again as fast as we can. 
1886,DOCTOR: I'm so sorry we damaged it. 
1887,"HOBSON: What? Oh, yes. "
1888,[Control room]
1889,
1890,"HOBSON: Nils, rig up a temporary aerial. Call up"
1891,"Space Control. Tell Rinberg we will be operational in er, oh about two"
1892,hours. He won't like it but it's the best we can do. 
1893,NILS: Right. 
1894,"HOBSON: Two hours, that's all we've got to get the world's weather back"
1895,"under control again. Benoit, take charge of your side. "
1896,"(Meanwhile, the Doctor, Ben, Polly and Jamie quietly leave.) "
1897,BENOIT: Right. 
1898,"HOBSON: And Doctor, what the? Oh well, perhaps it's just as well. We've"
1899,"got enough madmen here already. Now come on, I want to see your first"
1900,weather plot in two minutes. 
1901,"BENOIT: Right, come on boys. "
1902, [Lunar surface]
1903,
1904,"(Safely suited up, the travellers take a last at"
1905,the Moonbase before approaching the Tardis doors.) 
1906,"POLLY: Doctor, look. "
1907,(A comet-like object is streaking through space.) 
1908,POLLY: Could that be them? 
1909,DOCTOR: Possibly. And I hope it's the last we see of them. 
1910,(They all enter the Tardis and it dematerialises.)
1911,
1912,[Tardis]
1913,
1914,DOCTOR: There we are. In perfect flight. 
1915,"POLLY: Yes, and look what happened last time. "
1916,"DOCTOR: Oh, that. What a lot of fuss. Just a bumpy landing, that's all."
1917,It won't happen again. I know. 
1918,BEN: What are you up to now? 
1919,DOCTOR: Let's have a look at the time scanner. 
1920,POLLY: The what? 
1921,DOCTOR: The time scanner. Instead of the normal picture showing where
1922,"we are, it gives you a glimpse of the future. "
1923,JAMIE: The second sight? Very dangerous. 
1924,DOCTOR: Oh nonsense. I haven't used it very much. It's (cough) not very
1925,"reliable, as you can see. "
1926,POLLY: Doctor. 
1927,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
1928,POLLY: Look! 
1929,(The scanner shows an image of a giant claw.)
