20, [London sewers] 
21," (By torchlight, two Thames Water employees in hard"
22,hats are checking the condition of Sir Joseph Bazalgette's magnificent Victorian construction.) 
23,"DAVID: Yeah, let's take a look down here. Look at the state of it. "
24,BILL: This is a hoary old one. Talk about neglect. 
25,"DAVID: Yeah, there can't have been anyone down here for years. There"
26,are more bulges than an antenatal clinic. 
27,BILL: What's that? 
28,(The torchlight picks up a new brick wall.) 
29,BILL: Hang on a minute. We are under Fleet Street? 
30,"DAVID: Well, you've got the map. "
31,"BILL: According to this, there was work done here seven years ago."
32,Three half walls with vaulted buttresses. 
33,DAVID: We must be in the wrong tunnel. 
34,"BILL: No, we're not. "
35,"DAVID: Hang on, I'll check it out. "
36,(David leaves.) 
37,"BILL: No, we are in the right tunnel. David? David! David? You all"
38,right? David! 
39,(Something approaches. Bill screams then gets zapped.) 
40, [Tardis corridor] 
41, (The Doctor has two wall roundels open with wires
42,hanging out.) 
43,DOCTOR: Here we go again. 
44,"(He fiddles inside, then goes to another open roundel. There is a beep"
45,and he returns to the first.) 
46,"DOCTOR: Oh, there you are. Soon put you to rights. "
47,(The application of his sonic lance causes an electric arc.) 
48,"DOCTOR: Well, that shouldn't have happened. "
49,(Peri comes running.) 
50,PERI: What are you doing? 
51,DOCTOR: Something I should have done a long time ago. 
52, [Tardis room] 
53, (A small table is loaded with spare circuit
54,boards.) 
55,DOCTOR: Repair the chameleon circuit. 
56,PERI: What? 
57,"DOCTOR: The Tardis, when working properly, is capable of many amazing"
58,"things, not unlike myself. One of its functions is that it can change"
59,shape to blend perfectly with its surrounding environment. 
60,(He goes to an open roundel in this room.) 
61,PERI: I see. 
62,"DOCTOR: Not yet, you don't. I wonder why I didn't do it before. "
63,"PERI: Look, Doctor, do you really think you're up to this? I mean,"
64,you've only recently regenerated and yet you've undertaken so much
65,work. 
66,(The Doctor takes a bite from her apple and continues.) 
67,"PERI: Well, what I really mean to say is, you still seem a little"
68,unstable. 
69,"DOCTOR: Unstable? Unstable? Unstable! This is me, Peri. At this very"
70,moment I am as stable as you will ever see me. 
71,PERI: Oh dear. 
72,DOCTOR: You must forget how I used to be. I'm a Time Lord. A man of
73,"science, temperament and passion. "
74,PERI: And a very loud voice. 
75, [Tardis corridor] 
76," DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, that too. But not unstable. This"
77,"is the real me, Peri. But don't be afraid. I won't hurt you. I promise."
78,
79, [Tardis] 
80, (Peri follows the Doctor back into the console
81,"room, where he puts a component inside the console.) "
82,PERI: I still think you're doing too much. You need to rest. 
83,"DOCTOR: Rest? Nonsense. Rest is for the weary, sleep is for the dead. I"
84,"feel like a hungry man eager for the feast. Now, we've both spent too"
85,long in the Tardis. We need a change. Where would you like to go? 
86,PERI: Well 
87,"DOCTOR: For you, somewhere restful, I think. I'm sure after the"
88,"bleakness of Jaconda you could do with a sight of green hills, rolling"
89,countryside. 
90,"PERI: Yes, Doctor. "
91,DOCTOR: I know the very place. 
92,"(He enters coordinates and the Tardis tilts and goes wibbly, distorting"
93,their voices. They hang on to the console.) 
94,"PERI: Doctor, what's happening? "
95,DOCTOR: Just hold on. 
96,PERI: I'm being (something) 
97,DOCTOR: Keep hold. 
98," [Glenthorne Road, London] "
99," (A car pulls up outside the Dartmouth Castle pub,"
100,and a man we saw a few stories ago walking away from the mayhem in Shad
101,Thames dressed as a police inspector looks up at the building.) 
102,"LYTTON: Here we are, gentlemen. Inside that building is ten million"
103,pounds in diamonds. 
104,(The two men in the back seat peer out of the window up at UIP House.) 
105,PAYNE: Tasty. 
106,GRIFFITHS: Very tasty. 
107,(Everyone say Hi! to  Brian
108,"Glover, sadly type-cast as a low-intelligence villain.) "
109,LYTTON: How long will you need? 
110,RUSSELL: About half an hour. 
111,LYTTON: I'll send these two back with the car. 
112,RUSSELL: There's no need. I'll get a cab. 
113,"LYTTON: I said, Russell, I'll send the car for you. "
114,RUSSELL: Right. 
115,LYTTON: Don't look so hurt. We're not going back to the flat. We're
116,doing the job today. 
117,"GRIFFITHS: That's all of a sudden, isn't it? "
118,LYTTON: You had something else planned? 
119,"GRIFFITHS: No, it's just that I was expecting a bit more notice. "
120,"LYTTON: We go today, without fail. "
121,RUSSELL: What if I can't get the explosives? 
122,LYTTON: You assured me there's be no slip-ups. 
123,RUSSELL: Yeah. But seven kilos of plastic at such short notice? 
124,"LYTTON: I hope you're not telling me that there'll be problems,"
125,"Russell, because if you are, I shall be very angry. "
126,"RUSSELL: Don't worry, I'll get the stuff. "
127,LYTTON: Good. 
128,(Russell gets out of the car and walks away while Payne sniggers in the
129,back.) 
130,"PAYNE: I don't think he likes us very much, Mister Lytton. "
131,"LYTTON: If he lets me down, he'll have reason not to. You, Payne, will"
132,kill him. 
133,(Lytton drives them away.) 
134, [Telephone kiosk] 
135, (Russell is reporting in to someone.) 
136,"RUSSELL: Job's today. Well, I don't know. He's playing everything so"
137,"close. There's seven kilos of plastic. Look, don't argue, just have the"
138,stuff ready. I'm on my way in. 
139, [Tardis] 
140," (The Tardis has stabilised, and is still in"
141,flight.) 
142,DOCTOR: I must have crossed a wire. 
143,"PERI: Well, I hope you never do anything more serious. I think my heart"
144,is where my liver should be. 
145,DOCTOR: Really? At least the Tardis isn't damaged. 
146,PERI: Big deal. 
147,"DOCTOR: Be grateful. If its shell had been punctured, you'd find it"
148,very difficult to breath in a vacuum. 
149,"PERI: I'm grateful. I'm grateful. Just tell me where we are, if you"
150,can. 
151,DOCTOR: O child of little faith. 
152,PERI: Do you blame me? 
153,(The Doctor turns on the scanner. A bright white blob with a tail is
154,flying through the blackness of space.) 
155,PERI: What's that? 
156,"DOCTOR: Comet nine oblique one two oblique four four. To you, Halley's"
157,comet. 
158,"PERI: It's very pretty, but it still doesn't tell me where we are. "
159,"DOCTOR: In your sun's solar system, in the year that you would"
160,"calculate as 1985. I was, in fact, taking you to Earth. "
161,PERI: Bit of an anticlimax after that journey. 
162,DOCTOR: Ungrateful wretch. 
163,"PERI: Well, what do you expect, applause? "
164,DOCTOR: A little gratitude wouldn't irretrievably damage my ego. 
165,"PERI: Come off it, Doctor. No one is more surprised than you that we"
166,came through it. 
167, [Junk yard] 
168," (Lytton, Griffiths and Payne take bags from the"
169,boot of the car and go into the building at the back of the yard.) 
170,GRIFFITHS: What's this then? I thought we were doing a diamond job. 
171,"LYTTON: For once, Griffiths, you're right. "
172,GRIFFITHS: Then what are we doing here? 
173,"LYTTON: It may come as a great disappointment to you, but I don't"
174,intend to enter the bank guns blazing and my face covered in a nylon
175,stocking. 
176,PAYNE: He's allergic to nylon. 
177,"GRIFFITHS: No, I'm not. "
178,LYTTON: We go in via the sewers. 
179,(They all peer into the hole in the ground.) 
180,PAYNE: Crafty. 
181,GRIFFITHS: Down there? 
182,LYTTON: The way is prepared. All we have to do is remove a few bricks
183,and we're in the sewer itself. 
184,"GRIFFITHS: That's good, but how do we get at the diamonds? "
185,LYTTON: Why do you think Russell has gone for explosives? 
186,"GRIFFITHS: You must be joking. Set that lot off, you'll have the old"
187,bill down on us. 
188,LYTTON: The vibrations will set off every alarm in the area. The police
189,won't know where to start. 
190, [Tardis] 
191," DOCTOR: There, that should do it. "
192,PERI: No more death-defying rides? 
193,DOCTOR: Absolutely not. 
194,(An open roundel blows out.) 
195,"DOCTOR: Well, hopefully not. "
196,PERI: Don't you think we should land? 
197,DOCTOR: Not at all. I have perfect rapport with this machine. 
198,"PERI: I only hope the Tardis knows it. Look, Doctor, out there are"
199,"thousands, millions of tons of ice. One ill-considered move could cause"
200,"us to collide with it. I'm scared, Doctor. You don't seem to understand"
201,that. 
202,"DOCTOR: Of course I do. But you have nothing to fear, I promise you. "
203,"PERI: I hope not. It's rather ironic. On Earth, Halley's comet is"
204,always associated with impending disaster. 
205,DOCTOR: That's nonsense. 
206,"PERI: Not when you're this close, it isn't. "
207, [Junk yard] 
208," (Now dressed in black, Lytton opens a battered"
209,steel cabinet and switches on some machinery that doesn't look as if it
210,belongs there. It beeps a few times then he turns it off again. Outside
211,- ) 
212,PAYNE: Lose the motor. Come on. 
213,(Payne and Russell go into the junk yard as two policemen patrolling
214,the other side of the road stop and watch.) 
215, [Tardis] 
216, (Peri turns off the scanner and goes to a section
217,of the console which is beeping.) 
218,PERI: Does that noise have anything to do with you? 
219,DOCTOR: No. It's a distress signal. 
220,PERI: How do you know? 
221,DOCTOR: Doh. Listen. That is an intergalactic distress call. 
222,PERI: Where's it coming from? 
223,"DOCTOR: Can't be far, the signal is very strong. "
224,PERI: What's all that other noise? 
225,DOCTOR: I'm not certain. Strange. It's coming from Earth. In 1985? 
226,PERI: That's not possible. 
227,"DOCTOR: Possible it is. Desirable it isn't. I think when we arrive, we"
228,should investigate. 
229, [Junk yard] 
230, (Lytton has got a sub-machine gun.) 
231,RUSSELL: Excessive. 
232,LYTTON: Insurance. 
233,"RUSSELL: Start shooting that thing off, the police'll be calling out"
234,the SAS. 
235,"GRIFFITHS: He's right. That thing, it's obscene. "
236,LYTTON: Armed robbery is armed robbery. 
237,RUSSELL: How many of those things are we taking? 
238,LYTTON: Just the one. 
239,RUSSELL: It's one too many. 
240,"LYTTON: What about you, Payne? "
241,"PAYNE: Oh, I'm with you, Mister Lytton. "
242,"GRIFFITHS: I'm with you, Mister Lytton. You're with anything that gets"
243,you money. 
244,"LYTTON: Certainly there's dissent, and you, Russell, are at the centre"
245,of it. 
246,"RUSSELL: I don't like guns, and I don't like all this secrecy. We're"
247,"supposed to be on a job, but we don't know what we're doing. "
248,"LYTTON: You are new to this group and have yet to gain my confidence,"
249,that's why I tell you nothing. These two are muscleheads and wouldn't
250,understand what I said anyway. 
251,"GRIFFITHS: You've got a rough tongue, Mister Lytton. "
252,"LYTTON: Which you will learn to live with, Griffiths, otherwise you're"
253,"out. And as your earnings have never been better, that would be rather"
254,"foolish, wouldn't it? Let's go. Come on, Payne, there's work to be"
255,done. 
256,PAYNE: Right. 
257,(Payne gets down into the narrow access tunnel.) 
258,"PAYNE: Oh. Hey, how thick is the sewer wall? "
259,"LYTTON: Oh, nothing you can't handle. "
260,(Payne takes the heavy lump hammer.) 
261,PAYNE: I used to use one of these when I worked for the council. 
262,"LYTTON: This time it's for swinging, not leaning on. "
263, [Totter's Lane] 
264," (At number 76, the property of I M Foreman"
265,"according to the sign by the gate, the Tardis materialises in familiar"
266,territory. The Doctor peers out holding a signal detector.) 
267,DOCTOR: This looks familiar. 
268,PERI: Where are we? 
269,DOCTOR: Scrap yard. 
270,"PERI: I didn't mean that. I meant, whereabouts on Earth are we? "
271,DOCTOR: London. 
272,PERI: It didn't change. 
273,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
274,PERI: I thought you said it was going to blend into its surroundings. 
275,"DOCTOR: Oh, she's probably thinking about it. Come on, let's find out"
276,where those signals are coming from. 
277,(The Tardis changes into a highly ornamented dresser.) 
278,"PERI: Oh, neat, Doctor. "
279,DOCTOR: Neat? 
280,"PERI: Very neat. I mean, there's nothing at all incongruous about that."
281,
282,"DOCTOR: Well, she hasn't done it for a long time. She's out of"
283,practice. 
284,"PERI: Of course, Doctor. "
285, [London sewers] 
286," PAYNE: Hey, what about the ladder? "
287,LYTTON: Leave it. 
288,GRIFFITHS: How far do we have to go? 
289,LYTTON: About a mile. 
290,GRIFFITH: A mile in these boots? 
291,"PAYNE: Ah, you. Not allergic to walking as well, are you? "
292,LYTTON: Move. 
293,GRIFFITHS: The boots don't fit me. And it smells. 
294, [Back alley] 
295, DOCTOR: I suddenly feel conspicuous. 
296,PERI: I'm not surprised in that coat. 
297,DOCTOR: It's more a question of having organised a surprise party and
298,forgotten who it's for. 
299,"PERI: Look, Doctor, since you regenerated, it's as though your memory's"
300,"been put through the meat grinder. I mean, it's all there, but in a"
301,pile of unrelated bits and pieces. 
302,DOCTOR: That's a horrible simile. 
303,"PERI: It's true, though. In the past couple of days you've called me"
304,"Tegan, Zoe, Susan. On one occasion you even referred to me as Jamie. "
305,DOCTOR: Merely slips of the tongue. 
306,PERI: I rather think they're slips of the mind. And while we're about
307,"it, who is this Terrible Zodin? "
308,"DOCTOR: I called you Zodin, did I? Oh, they don't make villains like"
309,her any more. A woman of rare guile and devilish cunning. 
310,PERI: Thanks a lot. 
311,DOCTOR: Perhaps you're right. My mind may be playing tricks on me. You
312,"know, I haven't thought about Zodin for years. "
313,PERI: Now where? 
314,(The Doctor leads her out of the alley at the back of the houses into
315,the road proper. He starts to go towards the junction then turns and
316,heads the other way. As they pass the alleyway we see the two policemen
317,"standing there, watching. The Doctor goes to a building on a corner.) "
318,DOCTOR: That's it. It's unoccupied. 
319,PERI: Are you sure this is the right place? 
320,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. I'm a fool. Of course I am. That's precisely what I"
321,would have done. 
322,PERI: What? 
323,(He runs back up the alley again. There are no policemen in sight.) 
324,DOCTOR: Come on. 
325,"PERI: Oh, what? "
326,(The policemen reappear behind them.) 
327, [London sewers] 
328," RUSSELL: I don't want to put the wind up you, but"
329,I think we're being followed. 
330,LYTTON: Are you sure? 
331,RUSSELL: Remember that scuffling sound we heard earlier? I heard it
332,again. 
333,"LYTTON: Payne, if we are being followed, deal with them. "
334,"PAYNE: Right, check. "
335,LYTTON: This way. 
336,(Payne stays behind and waits.) 
337, [Totters Lane] 
338, (The Doctor sees the sign by the gate this time.) 
339,"DOCTOR: Look, Susan. "
340,"PERI: Peri. Yeah, well, supposing there really are aliens here on"
341,"Earth. I mean, does it really matter? I mean, they don't all have ten"
342,heads and want to take over the world. 
343,"DOCTOR: Precisely. The poor thing may be trapped here, terrified. If it"
344,"is, I can do something about it. "
345,(The Tardis is still the highly ornate and nicely painted with floral
346,motifs dresser or whatever. The policemen watch from the gate.) 
347,PERI: That's if you can find the entrance. How do we get in? 
348,DOCTOR: I'm not sure. 
349,"PERI: Well, there still is a way in? "
350,DOCTOR: Of course there is. Somewhere. 
351,"(The Doctor goes round the back then beckons to Peri. The policemen,"
352,"who are the ones Lytton was controlling back in Resurrection, watch"
353,impassively as the Tardis dematerialises.) 
354, [Tardis] 
355, PERI: What are you searching for? 
356,DOCTOR: The source of the distress signal. 
357,PERI: I thought you said it was in the house? 
358,"DOCTOR: It is, but the source of the signal is transmitting from some"
359,elsewhere. 
360,PERI: I don't understand. 
361,DOCTOR: I also detected several weaker signals going into the house.
362,Our alien is being ultra-cautious. He's bouncing the signal off several
363,relay points around London. It could take days to find out where it's
364,coming from. 
365,PERI: Giving him plenty of time to move on. 
366,"DOCTOR: Hmm. You are brilliant, Peri. Absolutely brilliant! If the"
367,"signal is being relayed to prevent detection, then the house has to be"
368,watched. 
369,"PERI: Otherwise, how would the alien know someone had discovered his"
370,main transmitter? 
371,DOCTOR: Exactly. Let's find our alien before he has time to vanish. 
372,(The two policemen go to the junk yard.) 
373,DOCTOR: Almost there. Just got to lock on to his coordinates. 
374,PERI: I hope this alien appreciates what we're doing. 
375,"DOCTOR: I'm sure he will. Probably sitting there all of a dither,"
376,waiting for us to arrive. 
377,"(Down in the sewers, the waiting Payne gets zapped by the high-pitched"
378,whatever.) 
379, [Junk yard] 
380, (The Tardis materialises in Lytton's junk yard as
381,a small pedal pipe organ.) 
382,DOCTOR: This is getting ridiculous. 
383,PERI: I'm not saying a word. 
384,DOCTOR: I was certain I'd fixed it. 
385,(He pulls out a stop and plays the opening line from JS Bach's Toccata
386,and Fugue in B Minor.) 
387,PERI: Shush! Are you sure this is the right place? 
388,(The Doctor follows the signal on his detector.) 
389,PERI: Doc! 
390,(And steps right over the open sewer entrance.) 
391,PERI: Tor. 
392,(The Doctor goes to the metal cabinet.) 
393,PERI: Doctor? 
394,"DOCTOR: Not now, Peri. "
395,PERI: Doctor! 
396,(A policeman with a silenced handgun is looking out of the hole in the
397,ground.) 
398,"DOCTOR: Ah, how do you do, Constable? "
399,PERI: He's got a gun. 
400,"DOCTOR: I'm not blind, Peri. You look uncomfortable in that hole. Let"
401,me help you out. 
402,"(The policeman waves his gun at the Doctor, who kicks it away then"
403,pushes him down the hole. The Doctor follows and blows are exchanged
404,out of sight. The second policeman comes up behind Peri. She backs away
405,"to a pile of bricks, gathers up some dust and throws it in his eyes. He"
406,drops the gun and she picks it up.) 
407,PERI: Even I couldn't miss from this range. 
408,(The policeman relaxes as his colleagues helmet comes out of the hole.
409,"Peri turns her gun on it, but the Doctor is wearing it.) "
410,PERI: Never do such a stupid thing again. I could have killed you. 
411,DOCTOR: I believe you. 
412,PERI: Don't patronise me. 
413,DOCTOR: I wouldn't dare. You did very well. I'm impressed. 
414,(The Doctor frisks the policeman and gets his handcuffs.) 
415,PERI: What happened to the other one? 
416,"DOCTOR: He's er, having a little lie-down. "
417,(The Doctor handcuffs the policeman to a set of industrial scales.) 
418,DOCTOR: There. Key. 
419,(The policeman hands over a set of keys.) 
420,PERI: I'm assuming these aren't the real police. 
421,DOCTOR: I think you are correct in that assumption. Thank you. 
422,PERI: But why did they try to kill us? 
423,DOCTOR: The bottom of that pit has been dug out. I think it leads to
424,the sewers. Come on. 
425,(The Doctor takes off the policeman's helmet and disappears below
426,ground. Peri unscrews the silencer and puts the gun in her shorts
427,pocket.) 
428,"DOCTOR: Come on, Peri. "
429, [London sewers] 
430, RUSSELL: Payne's taking his time. 
431,"GRIFFITHS: He's got lost. No sense of direction. No sense at all, come"
432,to that. 
433,RUSSELL: You want me to go back? 
434,"LYTTON: No, he'll find us once we start making some noise. We've"
435,arrived. 
436,RUSSELL: Can I see the map? 
437,(Lytton hands it over.) 
438,"LYTTON: Right, Griffiths. That wall will have to come down. "
439,GRIFFITHS: How thick is it? 
440,LYTTON: Less than you. 
441,"GRIFFITHS: That's not very kind, Mister Lytton. "
442,"RUSSELL: Hang on a minute, this is getting stupid. That wall isn't"
443,supposed to be there. 
444,"LYTTON: The map, Russell, simply isn't pinpoint accurate. "
445,"RUSSELL: Oh, great. Terrific. I thought you'd recced all this. "
446,LYTTON: We're in the right place. 
447,RUSSELL: But how do we know that's right? Nothing else is. 
448,"LYTTON: Unless you want to throw away ten million pounds in diamonds, I"
449,suggest one of you starts knocking the wall down. 
450,"(Meanwhile, elsewhere in the dark.) "
451,PERI: I only hope this is the right direction. 
452,DOCTOR: You saw the signs and scuff marks on the bricks. 
453,PERI: They could have been made at any time. 
454,"DOCTOR: No, they're recent. I have an instinct for these things. "
455,PERI: To think this is my first visit to London. 
456,DOCTOR: It is an interesting city. 
457,PERI: I'm sure it's fascinating. It'd be nice to see the sights like a
458,regular tourist. 
459,DOCTOR: Hmm? You'll find this route more memorable. 
460,PERI: That I believe. 
461,(Back with the putative bank robbers.) 
462,LYTTON: Still no sign of Payne? 
463,RUSSELL: Something's happened to him. 
464,LYTTON: Hardly. 
465,GRIFFITHS: Hey. Someone else want to have a go? 
466,RUSSELL: Not particularly. 
467,GRIFFITHS: This is hard work. 
468,LYTTON: There he is. What's he doing down there? 
469,RUSSELL: That's not Payne. It's too big. Shut that racket. 
470,GRIFFITHS: What's up? 
471,RUSSELL: There's someone in the tunnel. Challenge him. 
472,GRIFFITHS: We can still kill him. 
473,LYTTON: No. 
474,"GRIFFITHS: What's the matter, you lost your bottle? "
475,(Light glints off the approaching silver humanoid.) 
476,GRIFFITHS: What is it? 
477,(Griffith produces a gun and shoots at it.) 
478,GRIFFITHS: Let him have it! 
479,LYTTON: Hold your fire! 
480,"GRIFFITHS: What's your game, Lytton? "
481,LYTTON: Move back. Move back! 
482,(A doorway in the sewer wall slides open and more Cybermen appear.) 
483,"LYTTON: My name is Lytton, and I am your prisoner, Cybermen. "
484,"(Lytton hands over the gun, and the Cyberman breaks it in half."
485,Griffiths turns to run but a Cyberman is behind him so he screams
486,instead. 
487,Elsewhere -) 
488,"PERI: Doctor, you said it was gunfire. "
489,DOCTOR: I heard me. Someone may be hurt. They may need our help. Come
490,along. 
491,PERI: Doctor. 
492,(The Doctor finds a body and Peri a gun. It must be Payne.) 
493,DOCTOR: His neck's been broken. 
494,"PERI: Well, what did we hear? This hasn't been fired. We must fetch the"
495,police. 
496,DOCTOR: One moment. I'm thinking. 
497,"PERI: Look, Doctor, this isn't some deserted planet in the middle of"
498,nowhere. You don't have to play the Lone Ranger. 
499,"DOCTOR: Hmm? Yes. Yes, you're absolutely right. But first, let's find"
500,some hard evidence. 
501,PERI: You've got a body here. What more do you want? 
502,DOCTOR: That's just the victim. The police will be more interested in
503,the perpetrator of the crime. This way. 
504, [Cyber lair] 
505, (A pretty big place to have stayed hidden. There
506,are people and Cybermen in some alcoves and one patrolling a catwalk in
507,the background.)
508,LEADER: How did you know where to find us? 
509,LYTTON: You have a ship hidden on the dark side of the moon. I tracked
510,your transmissions. 
511,LEADER: Inform Moonbase our signals are being detected. They must
512,increase the distortion. 
513,LYTTON: You're quite safe. Earth authorities can't pick up your
514,signals. It's beyond their technology. 
515,CYBERMAN: You were capable. 
516,LYTTON: I am not from Earth. 
517,LEADER: So you have said. 
518,CYBERMAN: But where do you come from? 
519,"LYTTON: Vita Fifteen, in the star system six nine zero. "
520,LEADER: What is the name of your satellite? 
521,LYTTON: Riften Five. 
522,LEADER: I have heard of that place. It is occupied by a race of
523,warriors. 
524,"CYBERMAN: Who fight only for money, Leader. He is not to be trusted. "
525,LYTTON: Listen to me. 
526,CYBERMAN: You will show respect to the Leader. 
527,"LYTTON: I will do more than that. I will serve him, aid you in your"
528,cause. 
529,"LEADER: If that is true, when you become as we are, you will serve the"
530,Cyber race well. 
531,"LYTTON: Oh, no, as myself. You forget, Leader, I have been tracking"
532,your transmissions. I know why you're here. 
533,CYBERMAN: He must be destroyed. He says he comes to aid us yet he
534,carries weapons. 
535,LYTTON: My gun was used in your cause. I didn't know he was armed. 
536,LEADER: You should not have brought others. 
537,LYTTON: I brought them as gifts for you to turn into Cybermen. 
538,"CYBERMAN: He lies, Leader. "
539,LEADER: Silence. There is logic in what he says. If he had wished our
540,"destruction, he could have betrayed our cause to Earth authorities. "
541,LYTTON: Precisely. 
542,LEADER: The Cyber Controller can decide their fate. 
543,"LYTTON: Thank you, Leader. Where will I have the honour of meeting him?"
544,
545,"LEADER: If you know of our activities, you will know where he is. "
546,LYTTON: I assume he is still on the planet Telos. 
547,LEADER: He is. 
548, [Telos] 
549," (Once again, Gerrards Cross quarry is playing a"
550,dry and desolate place where Cybermen stand guard over humanoid slave
551,labour. Three men nod at each other then Stratton knocks a Cyber head
552,off with a piece of pipe while the other two knock another over. A man
553,is killed by a Cyberman up on top of the quarry.) 
554,"BATES: Stratton, grab the head! The head! "
555,(Two Cybermen move in on Stratton. The one on the cliff edge destroys
556,the head.) 
557,STRATTON: What now? 
558,BATES: Run! 
559,"(The two men run up an unguarded slope, pushing other slaves out of the"
560,way.) 
561, [London sewers] 
562, (The Doctor and Peri have found the mystery brick
563,"wall. She prods the Doctor in the back, making him jump.) "
564,DOCTOR: Don't do that! 
565,"PERI: I'm sorry, I didn't realise you were so scared. "
566,DOCTOR: I'm not scared. I was thinking. What do you want? 
567,"PERI: Well, I was thinking too. You know that man we found back there,"
568,"do you think the alien killed him? And if he did, how do you think"
569,it'll respond to us? 
570,"DOCTOR: With gratitude. After all, I do have the means of getting it"
571,off this planet. 
572,PERI: I only hope it believes you. 
573,"DOCTOR: Well, if it doesn't, I shall beat it into submission with my"
574,charm. Come along. 
575,(The Doctor is stopped in his tracks by a small knife to the throat.) 
576,"RUSSELL: Drop it. I said, drop it, unless you want me to open up his"
577,throat. 
578,(Peri puts the gun on the ground. He grabs it.) 
579,"RUSSELL: Over there. Now, who are you? "
580,"DOCTOR: At the moment, suffice to say that this is Peri and I am known"
581,as the Doctor. 
582,PERI: Hi. 
583,(Russell frisks the Doctor and finds Payne's gun.) 
584,RUSSELL: Where did you get this from? 
585,DOCTOR: I found it. 
586,RUSSELL: Oh yes? I wasn't aware it was lost. 
587,"DOCTOR: Put another way, its former owner will have no further use for"
588,it. 
589,RUSSELL: Turn around. Hands on the wall. 
590, [Telos] 
591, STRATTON: We're safe. 
592,BATES: Safe? It was a shambles. 
593,STRATTON: We got away. 
594,"BATES: Two of us. How many times have I got to tell you, it takes three"
595,to fly the ship. When are you going to get that fact in your thick
596,head? 
597,STRATTON: Now is not the time or place to argue. 
598,BATES: Argue? I could kill you! Why didn't you grab the head? 
599,STRATTON: I panicked! 
600,"BATES: Stratton, without that head and the third member, we are as much"
601,prisoners on Telos as if we'd stayed in the work party! 
602, [Cyber lair] 
603, GRIFFITHS: You seem to have sorted them out. Wish
604,I had your presence of mind. 
605,LYTTON: Really? 
606,GRIFFITHS: How did you know all that stuff you told them? 
607,LYTTON: Perhaps it's true. 
608,GRIFFITHS: You said you came from Fulham. 
609,"LYTTON: You know, Griffiths, when I look at you, I often wonder why"
610,your ancestors bothered to climb out of the primordial slime. 
611,"GRIFFITHS: That sounds like another insult, Mister Lytton. "
612, [Telos] 
613, (Stratton and Bates look down on the work party
614,again.) 
615,BATES: I don't believe it. They're working as if nothing had happened.
616,Why didn't any of them try to escape? They know the situation. 
617,"STRATTON: Maybe they know more than us, or they got more sense. "
618,BATES: Sense. Sense! You moron. What do you think we've been doing for
619,the last fortnight? We've been mining the planet with high explosive.
620,When the Cybermen leave they're going to destroy the surface of Telos
621,and us with it. 
622,STRATTON: Let's get out of here before they come and get us. 
623,BATES: They won't be coming to get us. They know precisely where we're
624,going. Cyber Control. 
625,(Bates points to a construction sticking out of the highest point in
626,the area. 
627, [Cyber Control] 
628," (Like in the lair on Earth, there are humanoids"
629,and Cybermen in alcoves around the walls.) 
630,CYBERMAN: Controller. 
631,(The Cyber Controller has a highly domed head without the tubes to the
632,ear pieces. It talks slightly staccato and is more heavily built around
633,the belly and thighs than other Cybermen.) 
634,CYBERMAN: Two of the work party have escaped. 
635,CONTROLLER: Who are they? 
636,CYBERMAN: Stratton and Bates. 
637,CONTROLLER: That is to be expected. They will attempt to recapture
638,their ship. 
639,CYBERMAN: Shall I instruct the time vessel on its return to remain in
640,orbit. 
641,"CONTROLLER: No, it must land. We need the ship here. It will also"
642,provide the escapees with an incentive. There will be some scientific
643,value in studying how they attempt to evade their destruction. 
644, [London sewers] 
645, (Russell holds up the Doctor's new favourite
646,tool.) 
647,"RUSSELL: What's this, then? "
648,DOCTOR: A sonic lance. How much longer do we have to maintain this
649,ridiculous posture? We've told you all we know. 
650,PERI: Which is more than you have. Who are you? 
651,RUSSELL: Police. 
652,PERI: Yeah. 
653,DOCTOR: Can you prove that? 
654,RUSSELL: Put your hands back on the wall. 
655,"(The Doctor tackles Russell, knocking him down.) "
656,"DOCTOR: Peri, gun! "
657,(The Doctor retrieves his sonic lance.) 
658,"DOCTOR: Sorry about that, but we weren't getting very far with me"
659,playing patty-cake with the wall. 
660,RUSSELL: Who are you? 
661,DOCTOR: I've already told you. I am known as the Doctor. I'm also a
662,Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey in the constellation of
663,Kasterborous. 
664,RUSSELL: You're bonkers. 
665,"DOCTOR: That's debatable, but I'm also telling the truth. The question"
666,"is, are you? "
667,RUSSELL: Yes. 
668,DOCTOR: And what are you doing down here? 
669,RUSSELL: Robbing a diamond merchants. 
670,PERI: I thought the police were supposed to uphold the law? 
671,"RUSSELL: Oh, they do, most of the time. "
672,DOCTOR: You're beginning to annoy me. 
673,RUSSELL: The truth wouldn't make much sense to you. 
674,"DOCTOR: Try me. Oh, I've had enough of this. Shoot him, Peri. "
675,PERI: For real? 
676,"DOCTOR: Yeah, shoot him. "
677,"RUSSELL: You murder a police officer, you'll get thirty years. "
678,DOCTOR: Handful of heartbeats to a Time Lord. 
679,"PERI: Oh, please tell him what he wants to know. I'm sure it can't be"
680,that important. 
681,RUSSELL: I'm here to observe the activities of a white male suspect
682,known as Lytton. 
683,"DOCTOR: Lytton? Tall, lean, dark, dark, well-spoken? The sort of man"
684,who might shoot his mother just to keep his trigger finger supple? 
685,"RUSSELL: It's a more colourful description, but it could be him. "
686,"DOCTOR: Commander Lytton, late of the Dalek Task Force. "
687,RUSSELL: Dalek? 
688,DOCTOR: I should have guessed when we were attacked by those uniformed
689,policemen. How'd you get onto him? 
690,"RUSSELL: What? Oh, there was a raid on an electronics firm. Some rather"
691,specialised stuff was removed. 
692,PERI: I think we know where it went. 
693,"RUSSELL: Oh. Well, you'll be pleased to hear there's a reward. "
694,DOCTOR: Just get on with your story. 
695,"RUSSELL: Well, there was a whisper on the street that the job was down"
696,"to Lytton, only we'd never heard of him. "
697,DOCTOR: Just as if he'd come from another planet. 
698,"RUSSELL: Huh, perhaps he might have. When we checked there was no"
699,"record of his birth, school, driving licence, tax, nothing. Under"
700,normal circumstances we'd have just picked him up. 
701,DOCTOR: But you were curious. You wanted to know more about him. An act
702,"we may all live to regret. Not only is he from another planet, but he's"
703,also a professional killer. There. 
704,RUSSELL: Thank you. 
705,"DOCTOR: Would you mind, Peri? "
706,PERI: Where are we going? 
707,DOCTOR: Back to the Tardis. It's a bit overcrowded down here. 
708, [Cyber lair] 
709," LEADER: Lytton, my scouts have located three"
710,humanoids in the tunnels. 
711,GRIFFITHS: Perhaps it's the old bill. They'll soon sort out this fancy
712,dress party. 
713,LEADER: What does he say? 
714,LYTTON: He implies it could be the police. 
715,LEADER: The intruders must be dealt with. 
716,"CYBERMAN: Yes, Leader. "
717,LEADER: This time they must not be damaged. We cannot afford to be
718,wasteful. Our forces must grow in strength. 
719, [Cyber Control] 
720, CYBERMAN: Stratton and Bates have been located. 
721,CONTROLLER: So soon? Then give the order. 
722, [Telos] 
723," STRATTON: It's not going to work, is it? Are you"
724,planning to take the place by storm? 
725,BATES: You want to stay here? 
726,STRATTON: I want to know what we're going to do when we get to Cyber
727,Control. 
728,BATES: First we have to find another Cyber head. 
729,STRATTON: Why is that thing so important to you? 
730,"BATES: Like you, this planet really depresses me. "
731,(He ducks down as a Cyberman patrols another gully.) 
732,STRATTON: What is it? 
733,BATES: A chance to redeem yourself. You'll be all right. We'll only get
734,one chance. 
735,(The Cyberman comes close. Stratton puts his head above the ridge.) 
736,STRATTON: I say! Are you looking for me? 
737,(The Cyberman fires as Stratton ducks down again.) 
738,"STRATTON: Well, hurry up. I haven't got all day. "
739,"(The Cyberman starts up the slope. As it gets to the top, Bates knocks"
740,"its gun hand off with his pipe, then Stratton takes a swipe, sending it"
741,tumbling down the slope. They run down and Bates knocks its head off.) 
742,STRATTON: You're mad. Why didn't you let me use the gun on him? 
743,BATES: Too risky. You might have damaged it. 
744,STRATTON: So? Now you have a trophy. 
745,"BATES: More than that. Once you've cleaned it out, you can wear it. As"
746,"prisoner and escort, we might just get into Cyber Control. "
747,STRATTON: I will not wear that thing. 
748,BATES: You got a better idea? Then get started. 
749, [Cyber Control] 
750, CYBERMAN: The escapees have destroyed the Cyber
751,scout. 
752,CONTROLLER: That is not possible. 
753,"CYBERMAN: It is a fact, Controller. "
754,CONTROLLER: They are now proving too resourceful. Alert the guard. They
755,must not enter Cyber Control alive. 
756, [London sewers] 
757, PERI: These tunnels all look the same to me. 
758,DOCTOR: This is the right way. 
759,RUSSELL: Which way? 
760,DOCTOR: Bear left. What is it? 
761,RUSSELL: Look for yourself. 
762,(The Doctor turns off his tiny torch and peers round the corner. He
763,sees a silver figure.) 
764,PERI: What is it? 
765,DOCTOR: A Cyberman. 
766, [Cyber lair] 
767," CYBERMAN: Leader, the instruments show time"
768,distortion nearby. Shall I instruct the scouts to investigate? 
769,LEADER: At once. 
770, [London sewers] 
771, DOCTOR: It's still there. 
772,RUSSELL: I saw one of these things earlier. They must be all over the
773,place. 
774,PERI: What are they? 
775,DOCTOR: A particularly unpleasant alien life form. 
776,PERI: Oh. 
777,RUSSELL: Where are you going? 
778,PERI: You want to fight it? 
779,DOCTOR: We can at least try. 
780,RUSSELL: What can you do with that? 
781,DOCTOR: Shake it up a little. 
782,"PERI: Let's go, Doctor, please. "
783,"DOCTOR: Wait, watch and learn. "
784,(He fires up his tiny sonic lance and creeps around the corner. When
785,"the Cyberman is close enough, the Doctor jabs the lance into its chest"
786,plate. It collapses and goes bang!) 
787, [Cyber lair] 
788, (A red light flashes on a console.) 
789,CYBERMAN: A Cyber scout has been destroyed. 
790,LEADER: The attackers must be found. 
791,"GRIFFITHS: (Cyber-like) Getting a bit rough, is it? "
792,(The Cyber Leader squeezes Griffiths' head between his fists.) 
793,LEADER: Remain silent or you will die. Transfer the humanoids to our
794,ship and then seal this place. It must not be discovered. You and you
795,will come with me. 
796,"(Griffiths, Lytton and the Cyberman follow the Leader out.) "
797, [London sewers] 
798, DOCTOR: At least we can fight them. 
799,PERI: Fight them? We need help. 
800,RUSSELL: We need the army. 
801,"DOCTOR: First, we need a plan. This way. "
802,(They get to the junk yard entrance ladder.) 
803,"DOCTOR: Quick, up you go. "
804,"PERI: I'm going, I'm going. "
805,DOCTOR: Don't leave the pit till I get there. 
806,"PERI : No, Doctor. "
807,DOCTOR: And save your breath for climbing. 
808,"PERI : Yes, Doctor. "
809,(The Doctor starts up the ladder with Russell behind him. 
810,"Meanwhile, Lytton finds the dead Cyberman and what killed him.) "
811,LYTTON: Sonic lance from Earth? 
812,"CYBERMAN: An alien? That would make sense of the time distortion,"
813,Leader.
814,LYTTON: I can guess who it is. I've been expecting him to return. He
815,calls himself the Doctor. 
816,LEADER: Excellent. 
817,LYTTON: You know of him? 
818,CYBERMAN: He is an enemy of the Cyber race. His capture will serve our
819,term. 
820,LEADER: More so the capture of his Tardis. 
821, [Junk yard] 
822, (The policeman has freed himself from his
823,handcuffs.) 
824,PERI: Cybermen? 
825,DOCTOR: Come on. 
826,(Russell looks at the organ in the yard.) 
827,RUSSELL: That wasn't here before. 
828,(The Doctor drags him inside it.) 
829, [Tardis] 
830," (The Doctor enters the console room cautiously,"
831,and a Cyberman grabs him around the throat. Russell shoots it and it
832,"drops the Doctor, then he puts two rounds into its 'mouth' to no"
833,"immediate effect. As it steps forward, its head explodes. Russell picks"
834,"up the cyber gun. The Doctor is still on the floor, trying to recover"
835,his breath.) 
836,RUSSELL: How does this thing work? 
837,(He test fires it at the wall.) 
838,RUSSELL: Sorry. 
839,"DOCTOR: Careful, there may be others. "
840,(A Cyberman comes through the interior door and Russell shoots it.) 
841,DOCTOR: Shut the main doors. 
842,(Peri reaches for the control but something near it goes bang!) 
843,PERI: Ow! 
844,"RUSSELL: Peri, look out! "
845,(More Cybermen enter from inside and outside. Lytton and Griffiths also
846,"enter, hands on heads. "

848,RUSSELL: No!

858,PERI: I agree. 
859,LEADER: There is nothing to discuss. 
860,"DOCTOR: If you want my cooperation, she must live. "
861,"LEADER: We cannot agree to bargain, Doctor. It would be unfortunate if"
862,"you were to be killed, but we should still have your Tardis. "
863,(The Doctor dives for the console and presses a few buttons.) 
864,"DOCTOR: Not anymore, you don't. In precisely twenty seconds, you and it"
865,will cease to exist. 
866,(The Cyber Leader sees a 20 countdown on a monitor.) 
867,LEADER: Release the woman.

869,LEADER: You have my word. 
870,DOCTOR: I'm not sure that's enough. 
871,LEADER: Also that of the Cyber Controller. 
872,DOCTOR: I thought he was destroyed. 
873,"LEADER: No, merely damaged. "
874,DOCTOR: Where is he now? 
875,"LEADER: On our home planet, Telos. "
876,DOCTOR: I see. 
877,(The countdown has reached 3.)

882,"(The Doctor obeys, and the small pipe organ dematerialises from the"
883,junk yard.) 
884, [Telos] 
885, (Stratton is slowly undressing over the body of
886,the Cyber scout they 'killed'. He is wearing the same sort of Cyber
887,overalls under his jacket.) 
888,"BATES: Come on, hurry up. "
889,(Stratton tries and fails to put on the head.) 
890,"BATES: You're going to have to try harder than that, Stratton. "
891,STRATTON: This isn't going to work. 
892,BATES: So you keep saying. 
893,STRATTON: Do I look like a Cyberman? 
894,(Bates puts the chest plate over Stratton's shoulders.) 
895,BATES: If nobody looks too close. 
896,STRATTON: This is fantasy. We won't convince anyone. 
897,"BATES: Listen, you pathetic creature. All we need do is convince the"
898,"guard we are prisoner and escort. At least, until we get close enough"
899,to deal with them. 
900,STRATTON: It won't work. 
901,BATES: You'd rather stay out here and die? 
902,STRATTON: No. 
903,(Bates puts the head on Stratton. With its trailing tubes and broken
904,"neck, it looks rather sad.) "
905, [Tardis room] 
906," (The Doctor, Lytton, Griffiths and Peri are shut"
907,in the room where the spare parts are.) 
908,DOCTOR: This is bad news. Very bad news. How can they have discovered
909,the laws of time? 
910,LYTTON: They haven't. A time vessel landed on Telos. The Cybermen were
911,able to capture it. 
912,DOCTOR: So they only have one ship? 
913,LYTTON: They will have two with your Tardis. 
914,DOCTOR: Doesn't make it any less depressing. How do you know what
915,happened on Telos? 
916,LYTTON: What does it matter? Just be grateful you're alive. 
917,PERI: I assume you two know each other. 
918,"DOCTOR: Unfortunately, yes. The last time we met, he was working for"
919,the Daleks. 
920,LYTTON: That wasn't out of choice. Your regeneration has made you
921,"vindictive, Doctor. "
922,DOCTOR: Not at all. I've never found it difficult to despise people
923,like you. 
924,LYTTON: I'm not working for the Cybermen. I'm in the same predicament
925,as you. Look around you. 
926,PERI: I think he means he's also a prisoner. 
927,DOCTOR: More likely a spy. 
928,"PERI: Does it really matter? He won't learn very much, and we certainly"
929,"aren't going anywhere except Telos, wherever that is. "
930,"GRIFFITHS: Yes, where is it? Look, I'm finding all this a bit"
931,"disturbing. Cybermen, now Daleks. Time travel in an organ. "
932,PERI: You'll get used to it. 
933, [Cyber Control] 
934," CYBERMAN: Control, our instruments register an"
935,irregular transmission from the Tardis. 
936,CONTROLLER: Inform the Cyber Leader on board. It will be the Doctor
937,attempting to inform the Time Lords of his destination. 
938,CYBERMAN: The Time Lords will attempt to stop us. 
939,"CONTROLLER: Whatever in their wisdom the Time Lords decide, they will"
940,be too late. Telos will have been destroyed and we shall have the
941,Doctor's Tardis. 
942, [Tardis room] 
943, (The Doctor is fiddling in the open roundel.
944,Lytton offers the sonic lance.) 
945,LYTTON: Is this any use? I wouldn't try sticking it into the Cyber
946,Controller. He might snap your hand off. 
947,PERI: What are you trying to do? 
948,DOCTOR: Upset the navigational control. If I can distort the
949,coordinates by just a fraction of a degree 
950,PERI: We'd miss Telos. 
951,DOCTOR: Not quite. 
952,GRIFFITHS: What is Telos? Is no one going to tell me? 
953,"LYTTON: I would have thought, Griffiths, even you would have managed to"
954,work that out by now. Telos is the Cybermen's home planet. 
955,"DOCTOR: Uh huh. Adopted planet. You'd have liked Telos, Peri, in the"
956,old days when the Cryons were in residence. They were the indigenous
957,population till the Cybermen wiped them out. 
958,LYTTON: They had nowhere else to go. 
959,"DOCTOR: Oh, for heaven's sake, man. The universe is littered with"
960,unpopulated planets. 
961,LYTTON: But few with the facilities that Telos offered. 
962,"DOCTOR: Well, that's hardly an excuse. "
963,PERI: What does he mean? 
964,DOCTOR: Refrigeration. 
965,PERI: That's a strange reason to commit genocide. 
966,DOCTOR: Not when you build refrigerated cities the way the Cryons did.
967,"They had a genius for it. Mind you, they had to. They couldn't live in"
968,temperatures above zero. 
969,GRIFFITHS: But why did the Cybermen need the cold? 
970,DOCTOR: Hibernation. They were running out of power. They needed to
971,"rest. And whatever you may say, Lytton, they could have built their own"
972,hibernation plant and refrigeration chambers anywhere. 
973,"PERI: Well, why not on their own planet? I assume they had one. What's"
974,the matter? 
975,GRIFFITHS: What is the matter? 
976,"LYTTON: Yes, Doctor. What's the matter? "
977, [Tardis] 
978, CYBERMAN: Cyber Control reports that we are
979,transmitting an irregular signal. 
980,LEADER: Prepare for our arrival on Telos and bring the Doctor to me. 
981, [Tardis room] 
982," DOCTOR: Mondas, the Cyber planet, was destroyed. "
983,LYTTON: But tell them how it was destroyed. 
984,DOCTOR: You're enjoying this. 
985,LYTTON: It's not often I have the opportunity to watch a Time Lord
986,squirm. 
987,DOCTOR: It blew up. 
988,LYTTON: Whilst it was attacking Earth. 
989,GRIFFITHS: What? 
990,LYTTON: Tell them when. 
991,DOCTOR: Take no notice of him. He's just trying to unnerve you. Your
992,planet survived the attack. 
993,PERI: When did it happen? 
994,DOCTOR: 1986. 
995,GRIFFITHS: Next year? That's almost now. 
996,DOCTOR: You could put it that way. 
997,"PERI: Well, you must do something. Inform Earth, tell them it's coming."
998,"I mean, what's happening to us now must have something to do with that."
999,
1000,DOCTOR: How can I do anything? I'm a prisoner. 
1001,"LYTTON: Even if he were free, he couldn't. He would transgress the laws"
1002,of time. 
1003,PERI: You interfere continually. 
1004,DOCTOR: Not to that extent. Even I have to be careful. 
1005,LYTTON: The Time Lords would have him destroyed. 
1006,"DOCTOR: And that would please you. Look, don't worry. Earth survived"
1007,with minimal damage. It's an historical fact. 
1008,"LYTTON: Yes, it's now become part of the web of time in the same way"
1009,that the Cryons were destroyed. 
1010,PERI: I'm not interested in the Cryons. 
1011,LYTTON: Hmm. There's compassion for you. 
1012,PERI: I didn't mean it like that. I'm confused. 
1013,"GRIFFITHS: So am I. I mean, how can a planet travel around off its"
1014,orbit? 
1015,DOCTOR: Mondas had a propulsion unit. A tribute to Cyber engineering.
1016,"Though why they should want to push a planet through space, I've no"
1017,idea. 
1018,(A Cyberman enters and points at Peri.) 
1019,CYBERMAN: You will come with me. 
1020,PERI: Why? 
1021,DOCTOR: Go with him. This is no time to be difficult. 
1022,CYBERMAN: And you will go to the console room. 
1023,DOCTOR: Telos. 
1024, [Cyber Control] 
1025, (The blast doors at the entrance to the complex
1026,"close, and a Cyberman flails around.) "
1027,"CYBERMAN: There is a rogue Cyberman on level four, Controller. "
1028,CONTROLLER: We must cease reactivation. 
1029,CYBERMAN: We are still finding undamaged specimens in hibernation. 
1030,CONTROLLER: But not enough to justify the heavy casualties being
1031,sustained by our resuscitation team. Cease reactivation. 
1032,CYBERMAN: Controller. 
1033,CONTROLLER: And order the rogue destroyed. 
1034, [Tardis] 
1035, DOCTOR: We had an agreement. 
1036,LEADER: The woman is unharmed. Telos is cold. She must have warmer
1037,clothing. I have kept my word but you have deceived us. 
1038,DOCTOR: What have I done? 
1039,(Two Cybermen grip the Doctor's shoulders and cause him great pain.) 
1040,LEADER: You will disconnect the signal you are transmitting. 
1041,(The Doctor is thrown against the console. He presses a sequence of
1042,buttons then nods. The Cyber Leader casually backhands him and the
1043,Doctor staggers back right across the room.) 
1044,"LEADER: You are foolish, Doctor. Next time, we will kill you. "
1045, [Telos] 
1046, STRATTON: I can't breathe. 
1047,BATES: Leave it alone. We're too close to Cyber Control. 
1048,STRATTON: I've got to rest for a minute. 
1049,BATES: Cybermen aren't supposed to rest. 
1050, [Tardis] 
1051, (Peri has swapped her swimsuit and shorts for a
1052,bright red catsuit.) 
1053,PERI: What happened? 
1054,DOCTOR: A little disagreement with our tin friends. 
1055,PERI: You look terrible. 
1056,DOCTOR: Not half as bad as I feel. 
1057,CYBERMAN: We are about to materialise. 
1058,PERI: (sotto) What have you done? 
1059,DOCTOR: (sotto) Nothing much. 
1060, [Cyber tombs] 
1061," (A pair of large wrought iron gates, the sort"
1062,"you'd find at the entrance to the driveway of a very large house,"
1063,materialise in a corridor. The Cybermen lead their captives out.) 
1064,GRIFFITHS: What happened to the organ? 
1065,"PERI: Do you really want to know? Oh, this place is so cold! "
1066,DOCTOR: I'd forgotten how big they were. 
1067,LYTTON: I can understand why they call them tombs. 
1068,PERI: I'm pleased you two are so impressed. I find the whole place
1069,hateful. 
1070,"DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose the atmosphere is rather rancid. "
1071,PERI: And it's freezing cold. 
1072,LEADER: We have materialised in the wrong place. 
1073,DOCTOR: Really? 
1074,LYTTON: He almost sounded concerned. 
1075,DOCTOR: Yes. I wonder why? 
1076, [Cyber Control] 
1077, CONTROLLER: The Tardis must be brought here.
1078,Despatch technicians to implement my orders. 
1079,"CYBERMAN: At once, Controller. "
1080, [Cyber tombs] 
1081," PERI: Oh, what is that terrible smell? "
1082,LYTTON: Death. 
1083,GRIFFITHS: Trust him to cheer everyone up. 
1084,"PERI: What do you mean, death? "
1085,"LYTTON: The sour, rank odour of death is unmistakable. "
1086,PERI: They're not dead. The Cybermen are hibernating. 
1087,DOCTOR: You know far more than you're saying. 
1088,"LYTTON: You'll find out, Doctor, all in good time. "
1089,"PERI: How can they smell? They can't be rotting, this place is freezing"
1090,cold. 
1091,LEADER: We must leave this place at once. 
1092,DOCTOR: Why? 
1093,"LEADER: We have far to travel, and the Controller awaits your arrival. "
1094,(A fist smashes out of one of the 'doors' and takes a Cyberman's head
1095,off.) 
1096,LYTTON: This way. 
1097,(Lytton and Griffiths run. A manky green Cyberman emerges.) 
1098,"DOCTOR: Run, Peri! "
1099,(The Doctor pushes Peri to follow Lytton. The Cyber Leader moves to
1100,confront the newcomer.) 
1101,PERI: What about you? 
1102,"(The Cyber Leader deals with the rogue, and Peri runs. Cyber Leader"
1103,turns to the Cyberman who is holding the Doctor with a raised arm.) 
1104,LEADER: He must not be harmed. 
1105,"CYBERMAN: What about the others, Leader? "
1106,LEADER: They are unimportant. 
1107,"(In another corridor, Peri looks through one door and sees nothing,"
1108,then goes back one. A green slime Cyberman burst out and grabs her. She
1109,"screams, and two slender beings come out of the other door and attack"
1110,it with their weapons. They take Peri with them into the cubicle as the
1111,Cyberman groans and staggers away.) 
1112,PERI: No! No! No! 
1113, [Tunnels] 
1114," LYTTON: Come on, keep moving. "
1115,GRIFFITHS: Just hang on a minute. I've been messed around enough today.
1116,Where are we going? 
1117,LYTTON: You want to get home? 
1118,GRIFFITHS: You can say that again. 
1119,LYTTON: That's where you're going. 
1120,"GRIFFITHS: Oh, I see. You've got a taxi waiting. "
1121,THREST : He speaks the truth. 
1122,GRIFFITHS: What's that? 
1123,(One of the slender beings rises from behind a rock.) 
1124,"THREST: My name is Threst. Welcome, Lytton. "
1125,GRIFFITHS: Does she know who you are? 
1126,THREST: Of course. Lytton has come to help us. 
1127,GRIFFITHS: You certainly know how to put yourself about. 
1128,"LYTTON: I was stranded on Earth. I sent out a distress call, the Cryons"
1129,picked it up. 
1130,THREST: And we told him the Cybermen had invaded our planet. 
1131,LYTTON: And I tricked the Cybermen into bringing us here to Telos. 
1132,THREST: For we need Lytton's help to defeat them. We also need you. 
1133,GRIFFITHS: Me? 
1134,THREST: It was why you were brought here. 
1135,LYTTON: I haven't told him yet. 
1136,GRIFFITHS: You never did intend to do that diamond job. 
1137,LYTTON: Would you have come if I'd told you the truth? 
1138,GRIFFITHS: You bet I wouldn't. 
1139,"LYTTON: That, Griffiths, is why I didn't tell you. "
1140,"GRIFFITHS: That, Mister Lytton, is why two men are dead. "
1141,LYTTON: It wasn't of my making. 
1142,GRIFFITHS: It certainly wasn't of theirs. 
1143,"THREST: We realise this must be confusing for you, but there is a way"
1144,"for you to get home. And of course, being a professional like Lytton,"
1145,we realise your time is valuable. 
1146,GRIFFITHS: Are you winding me up? 
1147,(Threst looks to Lytton for a translation.) 
1148,LYTTON: Attempting to annoy. 
1149,THREST: I hope not. We intend to pay you. 
1150,GRIFFITHS: What can you pay me? 
1151,LYTTON: The equivalent of two million pounds in uncut diamonds. 
1152,(Threst gives Griffiths a small cloth bag.) 
1153,THREST: We were surprised you wanted so little. 
1154,LYTTON: Diamonds are common on Telos. 
1155,GRIFFITHS: What am I supposed to do for these? 
1156,LYTTON: Help me steal a time vessel. 
1157, [Storeroom] 
1158, (The Doctor is pushed inside and the door closed.
1159,Even he is starting to feel the cold. A rather more well-endowed Cryon
1160,wearing a cape gets up from behind some containers. Everyone say Hi! to
1161,Faith Brown hiding underneath that mask.) 
1162,FLAST: Welcome. 
1163,DOCTOR: Hello. I'm the Doctor. 
1164,FLAST: My name is Flast. 
1165, [Tunnels] 
1166, (Griffiths puts on a rucksack.) 
1167,"GRIFFITHS: Look, what am I supposed to do? I'm none too clever behind"
1168,"the wheel of a car, never mind a time vessel. "
1169,"LYTTON: Your function, as always, Griffiths, is muscle. "
1170,THREST: And we have a crew. 
1171,GRIFFITHS: So what do I do? 
1172,LYTTON: Keep me alive. 
1173,(Lytton gives Griffiths a Cyber gun.) 
1174,GRIFFITHS: A minder? 
1175,LYTTON: A bodyguard. 
1176,THREST: An honourable profession. 
1177,GRIFFITHS: But why me? Why can't one of your lot do it? 
1178,THREST: We can only exist in temperatures below zero degrees. If I were
1179,"to venture onto the surface of the planet, I would boil. "
1180,"LYTTON: Come on, Griffiths. You're getting two million pounds for what"
1181,would be little more than a day's work. 
1182,GRIFFITHS: But will I live to spend it? 
1183,"LYTTON: If we capture the time vessel, yes. "
1184,GRIFFITHS: If we don't? 
1185,LYTTON: We'll be turned into emotionless Cybermen. 
1186, [Cryon cave] 
1187, (Peri wakes with a start.) 
1188,"ROST: Peace, child. We mean you no harm. "
1189,"VARNE: We rescued you from the Cybermen, at no inconsiderable risk to"
1190,ourselves. 
1191,"PERI: Oh, yes. I'm sorry, I'm confused. "
1192,"ROST: You must rest, then we will talk. "
1193,PERI: Who are you? 
1194,ROST: My name is Rost. This is Varne. 
1195,PERI: I'm Peri. I'm from the planet Earth. 
1196,"ROST: We know, child. "
1197,VARNE: We are Cryons. We no longer have a planet. 
1198, [Telos] 
1199, STRATTON: We won't get away with this. 
1200,BATES: Shut up! 
1201,(A hatch opens in the ground ahead of them. The two men run back over
1202,the ridge and hide. It is Lytton and Griffiths. They close the hatch
1203,after them.) 
1204, [Storeroom] 
1205, DOCTOR: I thought the Cybermen had destroyed the
1206,Cryons. 
1207,"FLAST: So did they, but as you see, some of us survived. Not many, but"
1208,some. You're looking very blue. 
1209,"DOCTOR: Do you mean depressed, or cold? "
1210,FLAST: Ah. I think I shall enjoy your company. 
1211,"DOCTOR: Not for long, I hope. I won't last half an hour in here. It's"
1212,freezing. 
1213,"FLAST: You are, in fact, the first company I've had in some time. I"
1214,honestly thought I would die without ever seeing another humanoid face.
1215,
1216,DOCTOR: Enjoy me while you can. I hope not to be around for too long. 
1217,"FLAST: Ah, escape. They all talk about that for the first few minutes,"
1218,then they become depressed. It's the locked door and the armed guard
1219,that's the unsolvable problem. 
1220,DOCTOR: Really. Could also have something to do with the lack of
1221,support on the part of their cellmate. 
1222,"FLAST: I hate the Cybermen more than you could ever know, and if I"
1223,"could do anything to frustrate or obstruct their course, I certainly"
1224,would. 
1225,DOCTOR: It seems your people have done quite a lot already. I assume
1226,you are responsible for the stench of death everywhere? 
1227,FLAST: I would be happier if the Cyber Controller and the others were
1228,all dead. 
1229,"DOCTOR: So would I, especially now that they can time travel. "
1230,"FLAST: Oh, but they can't. Not properly. "
1231,DOCTOR: They have a ship. 
1232,FLAST: Which they stole. They don't fully understand the principle of
1233,time. 
1234,DOCTOR: That's reassuring. 
1235,FLAST: I wouldn't get too excited. 
1236,DOCTOR: I rarely do. 
1237,FLAST: Because what they have in mind will undoubtedly distress you. 
1238,"DOCTOR: Well, tell me gently. "
1239,FLAST: They intend to change history. 
1240,DOCTOR: They can't! It's against all the laws of time! 
1241,"FLAST: Then perhaps you should tell them, because if you don't, they"
1242,intend to prevent Mondas from being destroyed. 
1243, [Cyber Control] 
1244, (A detonator switch is turned to ready.) 
1245,CYBERMAN: All charges on the surface of the planet are set and primed. 
1246,CONTROLLER: Excellent. Instruct the technicians the Tardis must be
1247,brought here as soon as possible. 
1248, [Telos] 
1249, GRIFFITHS: This place is enormous. We'll never
1250,find them out here. 
1251,"LYTTON: Yes, we will. "
1252,GRIFFITHS: That thing. What does it do? 
1253,"LYTTON: It detects Cybermen, and there are two very close. "
1254,BATES: That's right. Don't turn round. Throw the gun down. Now the bag.
1255,
1256,(Griffiths obeys.) 
1257,BATES: You're looking for us? 
1258,"LYTTON: If you're Bates and Stratton, yes. "
1259,BATES: So you found us. 
1260,LYTTON: I think we can help each other. 
1261,BATES: Really? 
1262,(Bates frisks Griffiths.) 
1263,BATES: He's flesh and blood. 
1264,GRIFFITHS: What's he talking about? 
1265,(Bates checks Lytton.) 
1266,BATES: This one too. 
1267,GRIFFITHS: Are they Cybermen? 
1268,LYTTON: Almost. 
1269,BATES: This is what the Cybermen do to you. 
1270,(Bates pulls off a glove to reveal a cybernetic arm. He uses it to
1271,squeeze Griffiths' hand.) 
1272,GRIFFITHS: How much of you? 
1273,BATES: Arms and legs. Their conditioning process doesn't always work. 
1274,GRIFFITHS: You're sort of rejects. 
1275,BATES: That's one way of putting it. 
1276,GRIFFITHS: Will they do that to us? 
1277,"LYTTON: If they find us. But we won't be here. Like you, we want to"
1278,steal the time vessel. 
1279,BATES: We don't need you. 
1280,"LYTTON: The time vessel needs a crew of three, at minimum. Now, there"
1281,are two of us and there are two of you. I don't know how you intend to
1282,"get onto the landing pad, but I have a safe route. Through Cyber"
1283,Control. 
1284,(Bates snatches the small computer from Lytton.) 
1285,BATES: Where'd you get this from? 
1286,LYTTON: The Cryons. 
1287, [Cryon cave] 
1288," PERI: Look, I know you're busy "
1289,"ROST + VARNE: Come, child. "
1290,ROST: You should be resting. 
1291,"PERI: There isn't time. I have a friend, the Doctor. He's a prisoner of"
1292,the Cybermen. 
1293,ROST + VARNE: We know. And we know what you're about to ask. 
1294,(There is a picture of the Doctor being pushed into the storeroom on a
1295,monitor.) 
1296,ROST: Rescue is out of the question. We cannot go into Cyber Control.
1297,It is far too warm for us. We would boil and die. 
1298,"PERI: But the Doctor, he's a man of enormous resourcefulness. He could"
1299,help. How did you know that was the Doctor? I arrived with three men. 
1300,ROST: You never were very bright. 
1301,"VARNE: You should have killed her, then I wouldn't need to be. Anyway,"
1302,she can't use the information. 
1303,"PERI: You know Lytton, don't you. "
1304,"BOTH: We do, child. "
1305,PERI: The man's a criminal. 
1306,VARNE: Which is an excellent qualification for what he has to do. 
1307,PERI: He's working for you? I don't understand this. What can he do? 
1308,VARNE: Prevent the Cybermen leaving Telos. 
1309,PERI: But I thought you would have been glad to see them go. 
1310,ROST: On their departure they will attempt to destroy our planet. 
1311,PERI: But that's pointless. 
1312,VARNE: Nothing the Cybermen do is pointless. They want to study the
1313,effect of the explosion on the planet's atmosphere. 
1314,PERI: I see. 
1315,"ROST: Not fully, child. The Cybermen want to change history "
1316,"VARNE: It's the only way their race can survive. To do that, they must"
1317,destroy Earth. 
1318,PERI: What! 
1319,"ROST: You see, it was their encounter with Earth that brought about the"
1320,"destruction of their own planet, Mondas. For Mondas to survive, Earth"
1321,must be destroyed. 
1322, [Cyber Control] 
1323, CYBERMAN: Our scouts have located the entrance to
1324,Cyber Control Stratton and Bates have used. 
1325,LEADER: Instruct the scouts to follow and destroy the SVPs at once. 
1326, [Storeroom] 
1327, (The Doctor is running on the spot to try and keep
1328,warm.) 
1329,"DOCTOR: Mondas? Oh, I think my blood's beginning to congeal. Are you"
1330,sure about this? 
1331,"FLAST: Oh yes, I'm sure. "
1332,DOCTOR: How do they intend to destroy Earth? 
1333,FLAST: It would only be necessary to disrupt it. 
1334,DOCTOR: It would still take rather a large bomb. 
1335,"FLAST: They have one. A natural one. In fact, it's heading towards"
1336,Earth at this very moment. 
1337,DOCTOR: Halley's comet? 
1338,"FLAST: That's right. They plan to divert it, cause it to crash into"
1339,Earth. It'll make a very loud bang. 
1340,DOCTOR: Indeed it will. It'll also bring about a massive change in
1341,established history. The Time Lords would never allow it. 
1342,FLAST: Who knows? Perhaps their agents are already at work. 
1343,"DOCTOR: Well, if they are, they're taking their time about it. For a"
1344,"start, why? Wait a minute. No! Nos, not me! (shouts at the sky) You haven't manoeuvred me"
1345,into this mess just so I can get you out of it! It would have helped if
1346,I had known what was going on! 
1347,FLAST: You are a Time Lord? 
1348,"DOCTOR: Yes. And at the moment, a rather angry one. "
1349,FLAST: I want to see the Cybermen dealt with as much as the Time Lords
1350,do. 
1351,"DOCTOR: Oh? But surely, it must have occurred to you that if Mondas"
1352,"hadn't been destroyed, the Cybermen would never have come here. "
1353,"FLAST: Of course, but my people have accepted their fate. Your problem"
1354,is to convince the Cybermen of theirs. I think I can help you. I
1355,"managed to open one of these, but I couldn't do anything with it. "
1356,(She takes the Doctor to a pile of silver ammunition boxes.) 
1357,DOCTOR: What is it? 
1358,(It is full of white powder.) 
1359,"FLAST: Vastial. It's a mineral, very common in the colder areas of"
1360,"Telos. It's also very unstable. In fact, you have enough in your hand"
1361,"to blow it off. At this temperature, though, it's quite safe, quite"
1362,"useless, otherwise the Cybermen would hardly have locked us in here"
1363,with it. 
1364,DOCTOR: How warm does it have to get before it becomes unfriendly? 
1365,"FLAST: Ten degrees above zero. Fifteen, and it self-ignites. "
1366, [Cyber Control tunnel] 
1367, GRIFFITHS: Over here? 
1368,LYTTON: Up there. Gun? I'll keep you covered. 
1369,(Lytton swaps the computer map for Stratton's Cyber gun.) 
1370,LYTTON: Now move. 
1371,(Griffiths leads Bates and Stratton up a ladder. Lytton is about to
1372,follow when a Cyberman grabs his ankle.) 
1373,LYTTON: Help! 
1374, [Top of ladder] 
1375, BATES: There's nothing we can do to help him. Are
1376,you coming? 
1377, [Storeroom] 
1378," FLAST: Even if you can get the door open, the"
1379,guard in the corridor is armed. 
1380,DOCTOR: So you said. And so are we. 
1381,FLAST: But we're in here and he's out there. 
1382,DOCTOR: First things first. How much of this stuff do we need to
1383,destroy the guard? 
1384,FLAST: Very little. 
1385,(The Doctor uses a scoop to get some of the vastial out of the box and
1386,take it to Flast.) 
1387,"DOCTOR: Now, you're sure this will explode on contact with warm air? "
1388,"FLAST: Of course, but how will you get it out of here? "
1389,"DOCTOR: Wait, watch and learn. "
1390,(He switches on his sonic lance and starts on the door controls.) 
1391,"DOCTOR: If I do get it open, what happens to you? You can't leave here."
1392,The warmth in the corridor will kill you. 
1393,"FLAST: Destroy the guard first, then we'll discuss it. "
1394,(The door slides open a little way. The Doctor puts the scoop of
1395,vastial out in the corridor and closes it again. The Cyberman walks
1396,over and reaches down for the scoop. BANG! Fire runs up its cyber arm
1397,before its chest plate explodes.) 
1398,"DOCTOR: When they learn about this, they'll kill you. "
1399,FLAST: They'll simply complete a job they started some time ago. That
1400,"is what I've been waiting for, Time Lord. "
1401,(The Doctor looks at his sonic lance.) 
1402,FLAST: There is enough explosive in here to annihilate Cyber Control. 
1403,"DOCTOR: Well, there's not much power left in this lance, and that stuff"
1404,is very cold. It may not generate enough heat. 
1405,(The Doctor gives Flast the sonic lance.) 
1406,FLAST: The Cybermen will not leave Telos. 
1407, [Tunnels] 
1408," ROST: You must wait here, child. There will be a"
1409,guard on the Tardis. 
1410,PERI: It won't work. I can't operate the controls. If I try to move the
1411,"Tardis, anything could happen. "
1412,VARNE: We said we'd help you. 
1413,PERI: I don't think you realise how temperamental that machine is. I
1414,"mean, even the Doctor has problems piloting it. "
1415,(Varne's belt communicator beeps.) 
1416,VARNE: Varne. 
1417, [Cryon cave] 
1418, THREST: Lytton has been taken prisoner. 
1419, [Tunnels] 
1420, ROST: The Tardis must be moved. 
1421,(The Doctor is running past the Cyber tombs.) 
1422, [Cyber Control] 
1423, CONTROLLER: You have wasted both our time and
1424,energy. I know that you plan to steal or destroy my time vessel. You
1425,will tell me how it is to be done. 
1426,"(Lytton stays silent, so two Cybermen take hold of his hands and"
1427,"squeeze. Blood pours down them and he falls to the floor, screaming.) "
1428, [Cyber tombs] 
1429, (Rost takes a careful look around the corner to
1430,"where the Tardis is parked, then returns.) "
1431,ROST: There is a guard. There may be others inside. 
1432,"PERI: Well, don't look at me. I'm not going in after them. "
1433, [Cyber Control] 
1434," CONTROLLER: You are foolish, Lytton. You could"
1435,have saved yourself from pain. I told you you would tell us everything.
1436,Now you will become as we are. 
1437,"CYBERMAN: The time vessel is approaching Telos, Controller. "
1438,CONTROLLER: Excellent. Order it to land and have the Doctor brought to
1439,me. 
1440,CYBERMAN: Controller. (beep) The Cyberman guarding the Doctor does not
1441,respond. 
1442,CONTROLLER: Show him to me. 
1443,(The monitor shows the open storeroom door.) 
1444,CONTROLLER: The Doctor has escaped. He must be found. 
1445,"(Flast switches on the sonic lance, places it in a box of vastial and"
1446,closes the lid. She watches the steam drift out of it. 
1447,"Meanwhile, Bates, Stratton and Griffiths hear the time vessel lands on"
1448,the roof of Cyber Control above them.) 
1449, [Cyber tombs] 
1450, (The Doctor discovers the guard on the Tardis and
1451,retreats into a gun held by a Cryon.) 
1452,DOCTOR: Hello. I'm the Doctor. 
1453,"VARNE: Unless you help us, you won't be for very much longer. "
1454,"(Peri, Rost and another Cryon come out of a tomb.) "
1455,"PERI: Doctor, you escaped. You've got to help me. They want to destroy"
1456,the Tardis. 
1457,"DOCTOR: Well, that's not very friendly. "
1458,ROST: It would be more accurate to say that we do not wish the Cybermen
1459,to control it. 
1460,"DOCTOR: Well, there at least we agree. How many Cybermen are inside the"
1461,Tardis? 
1462,VARNE: We have no way of telling. 
1463,DOCTOR: Then we must find out. 
1464,"(He tries to shoulder his way into a tomb, and fails.) "
1465,DOCTOR: Do you mind? 
1466,(Varne uses her gun to blast the door.) 
1467, [Cyber tomb] 
1468," (A green, dead, Cyberman lies on the floor. The"
1469,Doctor goes to its head.) 
1470,PERI: What are you doing? 
1471,DOCTOR: Cybermen have an inbuilt distress signal. 
1472,PERI: But this thing's dead. 
1473,(The Doctor opens its faceplate.) 
1474,"DOCTOR: The signal is mechanical, not organic. There may be enough"
1475,power left in this battery to transmit. 
1476,PERI: And achieve what? 
1477,DOCTOR: A reaction from those inside the Tardis. The Cybermen have one
1478,weakness. They'll react to the distress of their own kind. When I was a
1479,"prisoner in Cyber Control, I met a friend of yours. "
1480,VARNE: Flast? But we thought she was dead. 
1481,"DOCTOR: If she isn't now, she soon will be. She's at the moment the"
1482,living detonator of a bomb that could go off at any second and kill us
1483,all. 
1484,(The Cyberman's distress signal works.) 
1485, [Storeroom] 
1486, LEADER: Search the room. The Doctor may have
1487,interfered with the vastial. 
1488,CYBERMAN: Leader. 
1489,(They've found Flast.) 
1490,LEADER: How long has the Doctor been gone? 
1491,FLAST: I don't know. I don't have an instrument for measuring time. 
1492,(Two Cybermen grab her shoulders.) 
1493,LEADER: You will answer my questions. 
1494,FLAST: I will not. 
1495,"LEADER: Very well, take her outside. "
1496,"(They push Flast into the corridor, where steam starts to come off her"
1497,as she writhes until she dies.) 
1498, [Outside the launch pad] 
1499," BATES: According to the map, the launching pad is"
1500,on the other side of this door. 
1501,STRATTON: We made it! 
1502,GRIFFITHS: Let's get aboard the ship before we open the champagne. 
1503,BATES: Give me that thing. Ready? 
1504,"(Bates takes the Cyber gun from Griffiths, then is suddenly pulled"
1505,"against the door, where he screams and dies. Then the door opens, and a"
1506,Cyberman shoots Stratton and Griffiths in the back as they try to run
1507,away.) 
1508, [Cyber Control] 
1509, (Lytton is undergoing Cyber conversion in an
1510,alcove.) 
1511,CYBERMAN: The intruders have been destroyed. 
1512,CONTROLLER: Excellent. You will all accompany me. 
1513,"(In the storeroom, Cybermen are packing up some items into a trolley,"
1514,while the vastial is quietly heating up by the far wall.) 
1515, [Cyber tombs] 
1516, (The Doctor sees another Cyberman come out of the
1517,Tardis. He goes back to the Cryons and Peri.) 
1518,DOCTOR: Are you ready? 
1519,ROST: Yes. 
1520,DOCTOR: There are two of them. This way. 
1521,(They hide behind pillars. As the Cybermen approach the area of the
1522,"distress signal, Rost shoots one of them with her Cyber gun. Varne"
1523,"steps out to get the other, but is killed herself, so Threst (I think)"
1524,kills the Cyberman.) 
1525,DOCTOR: I'm sorry. 
1526,ROST: Please remove your Tardis from Telos before you have to be
1527,rescued again. 
1528,"DOCTOR: What about you, Rost? "
1529,ROST: We shall survive. 
1530,"PERI: But Doctor, what about Lytton? "
1531,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
1532,PERI: He's been captured by the Cybermen. 
1533,DOCTOR: That should make him happy. 
1534,PERI: You don't understand. He's working for the Cryons. 
1535,DOCTOR: For you? 
1536,"ROST: Yes, for us. "
1537,"PERI: Well, you can't just let him die. "
1538,DOCTOR: Where's he likely to be now? 
1539,ROST: In the laboratory. 
1540,DOCTOR: I'll see what I can do. Good luck. 
1541,"ROST: And to you, Doctor. "
1542, [Storeroom] 
1543, CONTROLLER: Hurry. 
1544,"CYBERMAN: Controller, the technicians at the Doctor's Tardis do not"
1545,respond to our call. 
1546,CONTROLLER: That is not possible. 
1547,CYBERMAN: Instruments also indicate time disturbance. 
1548,CONTROLLER: The Tardis has been moved. 
1549, [Cyber Control] 
1550, (Lytton watches a blue police box materialise in
1551,the room. There are no complete Cybermen present. The Doctor comes out
1552,and goes over to him.) 
1553,LYTTON: I know you. 
1554,DOCTOR: That's right. And I'm just beginning to find out about you. 
1555,LYTTON: Did you put the sonic lance to good use? 
1556,DOCTOR: I did. Why didn't you say something? 
1557,LYTTON: Now you must kill me. 
1558,DOCTOR: I can help you. Hang on. 
1559,LYTTON: The drug is affecting my brain. Irreversible damage. 
1560,(The Doctor takes a sharp instrument from a computer console.) 
1561,DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. I'll tell you if its irreversible or not. Now
1562,just hang on. 
1563,LYTTON: I did my best. I kept my word. 
1564,(The Doctor starts trying to disconnect Lytton from the alcove
1565,systems.) 
1566,DOCTOR: I know. 
1567,"LYTTON: Please, Doctor. Kill me. "
1568,"(The Cyber Controller enters, weapon ready.) "
1569,"CONTROLLER: Move away from him, Doctor. "
1570,(The Doctor puts the knife in Lytton's hand.) 
1571,CONTROLLER: Emotion is a weakness. 
1572,DOCTOR: I don't think so. 
1573,CONTROLLER: It brought you back for your friend and it will cost you
1574,your life. 
1575,"(The Controller comes closer. Lytton stabs it in the arm, severing a"
1576,fluid tube. Green spurts everywhere as Lytton stabs again and again.
1577,The Doctor scrambles for the Controller's gun and shoots a Cyberman who
1578,enters the room. It spins round into the one behind it and the Doctor
1579,"shoots it, too. Then the Controller starts flailing around, knocking"
1580,the Doctor across the room. He grabs another gun and shoots it. The
1581,Controller's chest plate explodes satisfactorily. Peri has watched all
1582,this on the scanner. She comes out and joins the Doctor by the fallen
1583,Lytton.) 
1584,DOCTOR: I must help him. 
1585,"PERI: It's too late, Doctor. He's dead. "
1586,DOCTOR: I can't just leave him. 
1587,PERI: You must. There's nothing you can do. 
1588,DOCTOR: Why didn't he say something? 
1589,PERI: You never gave him a chance. 
1590,(The Doctor hustles Peri into the Tardis and it dematerialises. The
1591,Cybermen discover the smouldering box of explosive just before it goes
1592,"off, and the whole of Cyber Control goes KaBOOM!) "
1593, [Tardis] 
1594," DOCTOR: It didn't go very well, did it? "
1595,PERI: Earth's safe. So is history and the web of time. 
1596,DOCTOR: I meant on a personal level. I don't think I've ever misjudged
1597,anybody quite as badly as I did Lytton.
