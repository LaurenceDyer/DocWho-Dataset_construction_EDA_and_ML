22,(Gallifrey is in ruins. Only the Citadel stands
23,inside its protective dome. The man we saw as the Narrator in part one
24,strides across a bridge followed by two acolytes and takes his seat at
25,"the head of a table. Six time lords sit, three on each side, whilst a"
26,"woman is at the far end, scribbling on parchments. The rest of the"
27,space is in darkness.) 
28,RASSILON: What news of the Doctor? 
29,"CHANCELLOR: Disappeared, my Lord President. "
30,PARTISAN: (a woman) But we know his intention. He still possesses the
31,"Moment, and he'll use it to destroy Daleks and Time Lords alike. "
32,CHANCELLOR: The Visionary confirms it. 
33,(The Visionary is the woman at the end of the table. She has henna
34,tattoos on her
35,face and hands.) 
36,"VISIONARY: Ending, burning, falling. All of it falling. The black and"
37,"pitch and screaming fire, so burning. "
38,CHANCELLOR: All of her prophecies say the same. That this is the last
39,"day of the Time War. That Gallifrey falls. That we die, today. "
40,VISIONARY: Ending. Ending. Ending. Ending! 
41,PARTISAN: Perhaps it's time. This is only the furthest edge of the Time
42,"War. But at its heart, millions die every second, lost in bloodlust and"
43,"insanity. With time itself resurrecting them, to find new ways of dying"
44,"over and over again. A travesty of life. Isn't it better to end it, at"
45,last? 
46,RASSILON: Thank you for your opinion. 
47,(The Lord President stands and aims his blue metal gauntlet at the
48,"Partisan. Energy strikes her, she screams and is atomised.) "
49,RASSILON: I will not die! Do you hear me? A billion years of Time Lord
50,history riding on our backs. I will not let this perish. I will not! 
51,"CHANCELLOR: There is, er, there is one part of the prophecy, my Lord. "
52,(The Chancellor brings a paper to the Lord President.) 
53,"CHANCELLOR: Forgive me, I'm sorry. It's rather difficult to decipher,"
54,but it talks of two survivors beyond the Final Day. Two children of
55,Gallifrey. 
56,RASSILON: Does it name them? 
57,"CHANCELLOR: It foresees them locked in their final confrontation, The"
58,"Enmity of Ages, which would suggest "
59,RASSILON: The Doctor! And the Master. 
60,"CHANCELLOR: One word keeps being repeated, my Lord. One constant word."
61,Earth. 
62,VISIONARY: Earth. Earth. Earth. Earth. Earth. Earth. 
63,"CHANCELLOR: Planet Earth. Indigenous species, the human race. "
64,(A projection of the planet appears above the table.) 
65,VISIONARY: Earth. Earth. Earth. 
66,RASSILON: Maybe that's where the answer lies. Our salvation. On Earth.

70,"(The Doctor has been bound and gagged, strapped"
71,upright to a trolley. Wilf is tied to a chair nearby.) 
72,"MASTER: Now then, I've got a planet to run. Is everybody ready? "
73,"NAISMITH-MASTER [on screen]: Six billion, seven hundred and twenty"
74,"seven million, nine hundred and "
75,[Gate room]
76,
77,NAISMITH-MASTER: Forty nine thousand three hundred
78,and thirty eight versions of us 
79,[Naismith's study]
80,
81,NAISMITH-MASTER [on screen]: Awaiting orders. 
82,OBAMA-MASTER [on screen]: This is Washington. As President of the
83,"United States, I can transfer all the United Nations protocols to you"
84,"immediately, putting you in charge of all the Earth's"
85,defences. 
86,"GENERAL-MASTER [on screen]: UNIT HQ, Geneva reporting. All under your"
87,"command, sir. "
88,CHINESE-MASTER [on screen]: And this is the Central Military Commission
89,"here in Beijing, sir, with over two point five million soldiers, sir."
90,Present arms! 
91,MASTER: Enough soldiers and weapons to turn this planet into a warship.
92,"Nothing to say, Doctor? What's that? Pardon? Sorry? "
93,"WILF: You let him go, you swine. "
94,"MASTER: Oh, your dad's still kicking up a fuss. "
95,"WILF: Yeah? Well, I'd be proud if I was. "
96,"MASTER: Hush, now. Listen to your Master. "
97,"(Ring, ring.) "
98,MASTER: But that's a mobile. 
99,"WILF: Yeah, it's mine. Let me turn it off. "
100,"MASTER: No, no, no, no, no. I don't think you understand. Everybody on"
101,"this planet is me. And I'm not phoning you, so who the hell is that? "
102,"WILF: It's nobody. I tell you, it's nothing. It's probably one of them"
103,ring-back calls. 
104,(The Master searches Wilf's pockets and finds the revolver.) 
105,"MASTER: Ooo, and look at this. Good man! "
106,(He tosses it on the floor and gets the phone.) 
107,MASTER: Donna. Who's Donna? 
108,WILF: She's no one. Just leave it. 
109,"DONNA : Gramps, don't hang up. You've got to help me."
110,
111,[Alleyway]
112,
113,"DONNA: I ran out, but everyone was changing."
114,
115,[Naismith's study]
116,
117,MASTER: Who is she? Why didn't she change? 
118,"DONNA : Gramps, I can't hear you. "
119,"WILF: Well, it was this thing the Doctor did. He did it to her. The"
120,Metacrisis. 
121,"MASTER: Oh, he loves playing with Earth girls. Ugh! "
122,DONNA : Are you there? 
123,[Gate room]
124,
125,MASTER [on screen]: Find her. Trace the call. 
126,NAISMITH-MASTER: Trace the call. 
127,(A scientist-Master obeys.)
128,
129,[Naismith's study]
130,
131,DONNA : Are you still there? Can you hear me? 
132,"MASTER: Say goodbye to the freak, Granddad. "
133,"WILF: Donna, get out of there! Just get out of there. I'm telling you,"
134,run!
135,
136,[Gate room]
137,
138,"NAISMITH-MASTER: She's on Wessex Lane, Chiswick."
139,Open the phone lines. Everyone on Wessex Lane. Red alert. 
140,DONNA : What do I do? 
141,"WILF: Run, sweetheart, that's all. Run for your life!"
142,
143,[Alleyway]
144,
145,(Two Master lookalikes block Donna in.) 
146,DONNA: There's more of them. 
147,WILF : Donna? What's happening? Are you still there? 
148,DONNA: They're everywhere. 
149,"CHISWICK-MASTER: Oh, I'm starving. "
150,"WILF : Look, I'm telling you to run, Donna. "
151,CHISWICK-MASTER 2: I'm still hungry. 
152,[Naismith's study]
153,
154,"WILF: Just run, sweetheart. "
155,[Alleyway]
156,
157,WILF : Just run. 
158,(All the local Masters advance on Donna.) 
159,DONNA: It's not just them. I can see those things again. Those
160,creatures. Why can I see a giant wasp?
161,
162,[Naismith's study]
163,
164,"WILF: Donna, don't think about that. Donna, my love"
165,
166,[Alleyway]
167,
168,WILF : Don't! 
169,"DONNA: And it hurts. My head. It keeps getting hotter, and hotter, and"
170,"hotter, and hotter, and hotter! "
171,"(Golden energy surges from Donna, travelling along the alleyway and"
172,knocking down the Chiswick-Masters.) 
173,DONNA: What did I 
174,(Donna collapses.)
175,
176,[Naismith's study]
177,
178,"WILF: Donna? What was that? Donna? Donna, are you"
179,there? Donna.! Donna! Donna! 
180,"(The Doctor is smiling, and he winks. The Master goes over and removes"
181,his gag.) 
182,"DOCTOR: That's better. Hello. But really, did you think I'd leave my"
183,best friend without a defence mechanism? 
184,WILF: Doctor? What happened? 
185,"DOCTOR: She's all right. She's fine, I promise. She'll just sleep. "
186,"MASTER: Tell me, where's your Tardis? "
187,DOCTOR: You could be so wonderful. 
188,MASTER: Where is it? 
189,"DOCTOR: You're a genius. You're stone cold brilliant, you are. I swear,"
190,you really are. But you could be so much more. You could be beautiful.
191,"With a mind like that, we could travel the stars. It would be my"
192,"honour. Because you don't need to own the universe, just see it. To"
193,have the privilege of seeing the whole of time and space. That's
194,ownership enough. 
195,"MASTER: Would it stop, then? The noise in my head? "
196,DOCTOR: I can help. 
197,MASTER: I don't know what I'd be without that noise. 
198,"DOCTOR: I wonder what I'd be, without you. "
199,MASTER: Yeah. 
200,WILF: What does he mean? What noise? 
201,"MASTER: It began on Gallifrey, as children. Not that you'd call it"
202,childhood. More a life of duty. Eight years old. I was taken for
203,"initiation, to stare into the Untempered Schism. "
204,WILF: What does that mean? 
205,DOCTOR: It's a gap in the fabric of reality. You can see into the Time
206,Vortex itself. And it hurts. 
207,"MASTER: They took me there in the dark. I looked into time, old man,"
208,and I heard it calling to me. Drums. The never ending drums. 
209,[Black void]
210,
211,RASSILON: The Untempered Schism. That's when it
212,began. 
213,CHANCELLOR: History says the Master heard a rhythm. A torment that
214,stayed with him for the rest of his life. 
215,RASSILON: A drumbeat. A warrior's march. 
216,"CHANCELLOR: A symptom of insanity, my Lord. "
217,(The Visionary taps the rhythm for them with her long fingernail on the
218,metal surface of the table.) 
219,RASSILON: A rhythm of four. The heartbeat of a Time Lord.
220,
221,[Naismith's study]
222,
223,MASTER: Listen to it. Listen. 
224,DOCTOR: Then let's find it. You and me. 
225,"MASTER: Except. Oh. Oh, wait a minute. Oh, yes. Oh, that's good. "
226,DOCTOR: What? What is? 
227,"MASTER: The noise exists within my head, and now within six billion"
228,"heads. Everyone on Earth can hear it. Imagine. Oh. Oh, yes. "
229,(The Master's skeleton becomes briefly visible again.) 
230,DOCTOR: The Gate wasn't enough. You're still dying. 
231,MASTER: This body was born out of death. All it can do is die. But what
232,"did you say to me, back in the wasteland? You said the end of time. "
233,DOCTOR: I said something is returning. I was shown a prophecy. That's
234,why I need your help. 
235,MASTER: What if I'm part of it? Don't you see? The drumbeat is calling
236,from so far away. From the end of time itself. And now it's been
237,amplified six billion times. Triangulate all those signals. I could
238,"find its source. Oh, Doctor. That's what your prophecy was. Me! "
239,(He slaps the Doctor.) 
240,MASTER: Where's the Tardis? 
241,DOCTOR: No. Just stop. Just think. 
242,MASTER: (to guard) Kill him. 
243,(A helmeted guard goes over to Wilf.) 
244,"MASTER: I need that technology, Doctor. Tell me where it is, or the old"
245,man is dead. 
246,WILF: Don't tell him. 
247,MASTER: I'll kill him right now! 
248,"DOCTOR: Actually, the most impressive thing about you is that after all"
249,"this time, you're still bone dead stupid. "
250,MASTER: Take aim. 
251,"DOCTOR: You've got six billion pairs of eyes, but you still can't see"
252,"the obvious, can you? "
253,MASTER: Like what? 
254,DOCTOR: That guard is one inch too tall. 
255,"(The guard knocks out the Master with his rifle butt, then removes his"
256,helmet to reveal a green spiky head.) 
257,"ROSSITER: Oh my God, I hit him. I've never hit anyone in my life. "
258,(Green Addams runs in.) 
259,"ADDAMS: Well, come on. We need to get out of here fast. "
260,(She frees Wilf while Rossiter releases the Doctor.) 
261,WILF: God bless the cactuses! 
262,DOCTOR: That's cacti. 
263,ROSSITER: That's racist!
264,
265,[Gate room]
266,
267,"NAISMITH-MASTER: This prophecy of yours, Doctor,"
268,where did it come from? Doctor? 
269,[Naismith's study]
270,
271,ADDAMS: Come on! We've got to get out. 
272,ROSSITER: There's too many buckles and straps. 
273,ADDAMS: Just wheel him. 
274,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. Get me out. No, no, no, don't. Don't! No, no, no. "
275,[Gate room]
276,
277,(The Doctor is wheeled across in front of the
278,camera feed to the screen.) 
279,NAISMITH-MASTER: What's going on? Doctor!
280,
281,[Corridor]
282,
283,ROSSITER: Which way? 
284,ADDAMS: This way. 
285,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. The other way. I've got my Tardis. "
286,ADDAMS: I know what I'm doing. 
287,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, just just listen to me!"
288,
289,[Naismith's study]
290,
291,(The Master comes to as three guards run in.) 
292,MASTER: Find him. Find him!
293,
294,[Corridor]
295,
296,DOCTOR: Not the stairs. Not the stairs!
297,
298,[Basement corridor]
299,
300,DOCTOR: Worst rescue ever!
301,
302,[Gate room]
303,
304,"GUARD-MASTER : Underneath the Gate room, sir. "
305,NAISMITH-MASTER: Basement. Get him. 
306,"GUARD-MASTERS: Yes, sir."
307,
308,[Basement]
309,
310,"DOCTOR: Just, just stop and listen to me! "
311,(The Master runs in with armed guards.) 
312,MASTER: Gotcha. 
313,ADDAMS: You think so? 
314,(She presses her wristwatch.) 
315,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, don't! "
316,"(She, Rossiter, Wilf and the Doctor vanish.)"
317,
318,[Teleport room]
319,
320,DOCTOR: Now get me out of this thing! 
321,"ADDAMS: Don't say thanks, will you. "
322,DOCTOR: He's not going to let us go. Just hurry up and get me out! 
323,(Wilf looks out of a nearby window.) 
324,"WILF: Oh, my goodness me. We're in space! "
325,DOCTOR: Come on. 
326,ADDAMS: All right! 
327,"DOCTOR: Oh, get a move on. "
328,(They are on a spaceship made from very large round modules.)
329,
330,[Basement]
331,
332,(The Master works at a keyboard.) 
333,NAISMITH-MASTER : Open the teleport and follow him! 
334,[Teleport room]
335,
336,DOCTOR: Come on! 
337,ADDAMS: All right. 
338,(They finally get the Doctor free. He zaps the teleport controls with
339,his sonic screwdriver.) 
340,[Gate room]
341,
342,MASTER: He's still up there. Target practice.
343,
344,[Teleport room]
345,
346,DOCTOR: Where's your flight deck? 
347,ADDAMS: But we're safe. We're a hundred thousand miles above the Earth.
348,
349,DOCTOR: And he's got every single missile on the planet ready to fire. 
350,ADDAMS: Good point. 
351,"(Addams, Rossiter and the Doctor runs out. The Doctor returns to gently"
352,lead Wilf away from the window.) 
353,WILF: But we're in space! 
354,DOCTOR: Yep.
355,
356,[Gate room]
357,
358,MASTER: Turn everything you've got to the skies.
359,Find me that ship. And prime the missiles. 
360,[UNIT HQ Geneva]
361,
362,GENERAL-MASTER: Open up the radar. Maximum scan. 
363,"OPERATIVE-MASTERS: Yes, sir."
364,
365,[Flight deck]
366,
367,DOCTOR: We've got to close it down! 
368,"ROSSITER: No chance, mate. We're going home. "
369,ADDAMS: We're just a salvage team. Local politics has got nothing to do
370,with us. Not unless there's a carnival. Sooner we get back to Vinvocci
371,space the better. 
372,DOCTOR: We're not leaving. 
373,(The Doctor sonically sabotages the flight controls. The whole
374,spaceship goes dark.)
375,
376,[UNIT HQ Geneva]
377,
378,GENERAL-MASTER: Anything?
379,
380,[Flight deck]
381,
382,(Silent running.) 
383,"DOCTOR: Shush, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush."
384,
385,[UNIT HQ Geneva]
386,
387,"OPERATIVE-MASTER: I'm sorry, sir. Nothing. "
388,[Gate room]
389,
390,GENERAL-MASTER [on screen]: Lost him. 
391,MASTER: What about teleport coordinates?
392,
393,[Basement]
394,
395,MASTER : I need that information. 
396,"GUARD-MASTER: He's cut the link, sir. "
397,[Gate room]
398,
399,GUARD-MASTER : No trace. All dead. 
400,[Basement]
401,
402,"GUARD-MASTER: Still, open fire! "
403,(The guards shoot up the computers.) 
404,GUARD-MASTER: No way back now. He's stranded.
405,
406,[Flight deck]
407,
408,ADDAMS: No sign of any missiles. No sign of
409,anything. You've wrecked the place! 
410,ROSSITER: The engines are burnt out. All we've got is auxiliary lights.
411,Everything else is kaput. We can't move. We're stuck in orbit. 
412,"ADDAMS: Thanks to you, you idiot! "
413,(Addams leaves.) 
414,"WILF: I know you, though. I bet you've got a plan, haven't you? Eh?"
415,Come on. You've always got a trick up your sleeve. Nice little bit of
416,"the old Doctor flim-flam, (Tommy Cooper impression) sort of thing? Eh?"
417,"Oh, blimey."
418,
419,[Gate room]
420,
421,MASTER: Night has fallen. Are we ready? 
422,[Naismith's study]
423,
424,NAISMITH-MASTER: Every single one of us is
425,prepared. 
426,[Gate room]
427,
428,"MASTER: Then we listen. All of us, across the"
429,"world, just listen. "
430,(The whole Master population of Earth holds their breath and listens.) 
431,MASTER: Concentrate. Find the signal. There! The sound is tangible.
432,Someone could only have designed this. But who?
433,
434,[Black void]
435,
436,CHANCELLOR: The signal has been sent. A simple task
437,"of four beats transmitted back through time, and implanted in the"
438,Master's mind as a child. 
439,RASSILON: Then we have a link to where the Master is right now. 
440,"CHANCELLOR: But we're still trapped inside the Timelock, sir. The link"
441,"is nothing more than a thought, an idea. "
442,RASSILON: Then we need something to make the contact physical.
443,Something so simple. 
444,"VISIONARY: So small and shining. Shining bright and cold. The tiny,"
445,"tiny star, falling, falling, burning, burning, burning. "
446,(The Lord President takes a diamond from his staff.)
447,RASSILON: Small enough to follow the link. And if this were on Earth. 
448,(He throws the diamond at the image of the Earth. The Doctor is working
449,on some wiring when he sees a bright object streaking towards the
450,planet.)
451,
452,[Naismith's study]
453,
454,NAISMITH-MASTER: The sound. It's coming from above.
455,
456,[Gate room]
457,
458,MASTER: It's coming from the sky! 
459,[Terrace]
460,
461,MASTER: There! Find it. Get out there and find it! 
462,(The diamond falls to Earth with a big bang.) 
463,"GUARDS: Yes, sir."
464,
465,[Field]
466,
467,(Two Land Rovers drive up to the burning crater.
468,"The diamond is intact, sitting at the bottom of the hole.) "
469,"GUARD-MASTER: It's a diamond, sir. Oh. The most impossible diamond. You"
470,won't believe this. 
471,[Gate room]
472,
473,GUARD-MASTER : It's a Whitepoint star.
474,
475,[Spaceship corridor]
476,
477,WILF: Doctor? Hello? Hello? Is that you? Doctor?
478,"Anyone? Anyone? Oh, I think I'm lost. "
479,WOMAN: And yet you are found. Events are closing. The day is almost
480,"upon us. But tell me, old soldier. Did you take arms? "
481,WILF: I brought this. But what am I supposed to do? 
482,"WOMAN: This is the Doctor's final battle. At the end of his life, he"
483,"must stand at arms, or lose himself and all this world, to the End of"
484,Time. 
485,WILF: But he never carries guns. He doesn't do. Who are you? 
486,"WOMAN: I was lost, so very long ago."
487,
488,[Teleport room]
489,
490,"WILF: Aye, aye. Got this old tub mended? "
491,DOCTOR: Just trying to fix the heating. 
492,"WILF: Oh. I've always dreamt of a view like that. Hee, hee. I'm an"
493,"astronaut. It's dawn over England, look. Brand new day. My wife's"
494,buried down there. I might never visit her again now. Do you think he
495,"changed them, in their graves? "
496,DOCTOR: I'm sorry. 
497,"WILF: No, not your fault. "
498,DOCTOR: Isn't it? 
499,"WILF: Oh, 1948, I was over there. End of the Mandate in Palestine."
500,"Private Mott. Skinny little idiot, I was. Stood on this rooftop, in the"
501,"middle of a skirmish. It was like a blizzard, all them bullets in the"
502,"air. The world gone mad. Yeah, you don't want to listen to an old man's"
503,"tales, do you? "
504,DOCTOR: I'm older than you. 
505,WILF: Get away. 
506,DOCTOR: I'm nine hundred and six. 
507,"WILF: What, really, though? "
508,DOCTOR: Yeah. 
509,WILF: Nine hundred years. We must look like insects to you. 
510,DOCTOR: I think you look like giants. 
511,"WILF: Listen, I, I want you to have this. I've kept it all this time,"
512,and I thought 
513,(Wilf offers his revolver to the Doctor.) 
514,DOCTOR: No. 
515,"WILF: No, but if you take it, you could "
516,DOCTOR: No. You had that gun in the mansion. You could have shot the
517,Master there and then. 
518,"WILF: Too scared, I suppose. "
519,DOCTOR: I'd be proud. 
520,WILF: Of what? 
521,DOCTOR: If you were my dad. 
522,"WILF: Oh, come on, don't start. But you said, you were told he will"
523,"knock four times and then you die. Well, that's him, isn't it? The"
524,Master. That noise in his head? The Master is going to kill you. 
525,DOCTOR: Yeah. 
526,WILF: Then kill him first. 
527,DOCTOR: And that's how the Master started. It's not like I'm an
528,innocent. I've taken lives. I got worse. I got clever. Manipulated
529,people into taking their own. Sometimes I think a Time Lord lives too
530,long. I can't. I just can't. 
531,"WILF: If the Master dies, what happens to all the people? "
532,DOCTOR: I don't know. 
533,"WILF: Doctor, what happens? "
534,DOCTOR: The template snaps. 
535,"WILF: What, they go back to being human? They're alive, and human. Then"
536,"don't you dare, sir. Don't you dare put him before them. Now you take"
537,"this. That's an order, Doctor. Take the gun. You take the gun and save"
538,your life. And please don't die. You're the most wonderful man and I
539,don't want you to die. 
540,DOCTOR: Never. 
541,MASTER : A star fell from the sky.

548,"MASTER : Because now it makes sense, Doctor. "
549,"ADDAMS: It's an open broadcast. Don't reply, or he'll know where we"
550,are. 
551,MASTER : The whole of my life. 
552,[Teleport room]
553,
554,MASTER : My destiny. The star was a diamond.

557,MASTER: And the diamond is a Whitepoint

560,MASTER : Star. And I have worked all night to
561,sanctify that gift. 
562,[Gate room]
563,
564,(Scientist-Masters are working on a gizmo.) 
565,MASTER: Now the star is mine. I can increase the signal and use it as a
566,"lifeline. Do you get it now? Do you see? Keep watching, Doctor. This"
567,should be spectacular. 
568,[Teleport room]
569,
570,MASTER : Over and out. 
571,"WILF: What's he on about? What's he doing? Doctor, what does that mean?"
572,
573,DOCTOR: A Whitepoint star is only found on one planet. Gallifrey. Which
574,means it's the Time Lords. The Time Lords are returning. 
575,"WILF: Well, I mean, that's good, isn't it? I mean, that's your people. "
576,(The Doctor takes Wilf's revolver and runs.)

584,MASTER: Send the signal back and the link becomes a pathway. 
585,(The Master places the diamond in a bed of wires within the gizmo. It
586,begins to transmit the four beats.)

610,"Sanction. For this is the hour when either Gallifrey falls, or"
611,Gallifrey rises!

617,"(The Doctor is rushing around, working on bits and"
618,pieces.) 
619,WILF: But you said your people were dead. Past tense. 
620,"DOCTOR: Inside the Time War. And the whole War was Timelocked. Like,"
621,sealed inside a bubble. It's not a bubble but just think of a bubble.
622,Nothing can get in or get out of the Timelock. Don't you see? Nothing
623,"can get in or get out, except something that was already there. "
624,WILF: The signal. Since he was a kid. 
625,"DOCTOR: If they can follow the signal, they can escape before they die."
626,
627,"WILF: Well, then, big reunion. We'll have a party. "
628,DOCTOR: There will be no party. 
629,WILF: But I've heard you talk about your people like they're wonderful.
630,
631,"DOCTOR: That's how I choose to remember them, the Time Lords of old."
632,"But then they went to war. An endless war, and it changed them right to"
633,"the core. You've seen my enemies, Wilf. The Time Lords are more"
634,dangerous than any of them. 
635,"ADDAMS: Time Lords, what lords? Anyone want to explain? "
636,"DOCTOR: Right, yes, you. This is a salvage ship, yes? You go trawling"
637,the asteroid fields for junk? 
638,"ADDAMS: Yeah, what about it? "
639,"DOCTOR: So, you've got asteroid lasers! "
640,"ROSSITER: Yeah, but they're all frazzled. "
641,(The Doctor throws a lever and two gun alcoves open on either side of
642,the flight controls.) 
643,"DOCTOR: Consider them unfrazzled. You there, what's your name? (Addams)"
644,"I'm going to need you on navigation. (to Rossiter) And you, get in the"
645,laser-pod. Wilfred. 
646,WILF: Yeah?

914,DOCTOR: Yeah.

916,DOCTOR: The Master left the Nuclear Bolt running. It's gone into

919,"DOCTOR: No, because all the excess radiation gets vented inside there."

928,"WILF: Look, just leave me. "
929,"DOCTOR: Okay, right then, I will. Because you had to go in there,"
930,"didn't you? You had to go and get stuck, oh yes. Because that's who you"
931,"are, Wilfred. You were always this. Waiting for me all this time. "
932,"WILF: No really, just leave me. I'm an old man, Doctor. I've had my"
933,time. 
934,"DOCTOR: Well, exactly. Look at you. Not remotely important. But me? I"
935,could do so much more. So much more! But this is what I get. My reward.
