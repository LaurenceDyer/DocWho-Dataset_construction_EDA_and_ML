22, Part One
23,
24, [De Flores's villa] 
25, (South America 22nd November 1988. 
26,A group of men in camouflage fatigues get out of a jeep and go to into
27,"a Spanish style villa. Actually, it is at Goring by Sea, what an"
28,"appropriate name. Inside, Nazi paraphernalia and old scrolls are"
29,scattered on a table. The Ride of the Valkyries blares out as a young
30,man works at a computer. He completes the data input and the screen
31,tells him - Landing Location Windsor Grid Ref 74W 32N November 23 1988.
32,Outside on a balcony a silver haired man stands next to the record
33,"player. Everyone say Hi! to  Anton Diffring, the"
34,wonderful German actor. He picks up a modern bow to shoot a macaw in a
35,"nearby tree, then the young man comes out.) "
36,KARL: Herr De Flores. Herr De Flores. Wonderful news. 
37, [Lady Peinforte's home] 
38," (Windsor, England 1638. Okay, actually St Marys"
39,"House, Bramber, West Sussex. "
40,"In the grounds, a frowning woman in black velvet draws back a long bow"
41,while a man kneels at her feet. She misses the wood pigeon pecking at
42,her lawn.) 
43,"RICHARD: Very good, my lady. "
44,(The woman goes back inside to where an old man is working out
45,calculations amid bubbling pots.) 
46,PEINFORTE: How much longer? 
47,"RICHARD: He cannot hear you, my lady. Shall I "
48,PEINFORTE: Leave him. There'll be time enough to punish his
49,impertinence when he's finished. 
50,(Lady Peinforte takes an arrow from the fire irons.) 
51,PEINFORTE: Put this with the others. Are you so very feeble? The poison
52,cannot harm unless the arrow's tip should break the skin. Let who will
53,steal my gold. 
54,"RICHARD: And the silver arrow, my lady? "
55,PEINFORTE: Leave that to me. You're sure the potion is well mixed? 
56,"RICHARD: On my life, ma'am. I guarantee it. "
57,PEINFORTE: Good. We await but the calculation. Perhaps the fee will
58,speed matters. 
59,(Lady Peinforte takes a bag from the mantlepiece and throws it in front
60,of her mathematician.) 
61, [De Flores's villa] 
62, (De Flores enters the main room to speak to his
63,"troops, who have been given small glasses of drink. They stand to"
64,attention.) 
65,DE FLORES: Gentlemen. I wonder if even you can fully appreciate what
66,this moment means. You're standing now at the turning point of history.
67,The day of fulfillment of our mighty destiny is about to dawn. Fifty
68,"years ago, I stood at the side of the Fuehrer himself when he ordered"
69,"the first giant step to greatness, just as now the moment approaches"
70,"for the second and final one. It will be decisive, for this time, this"
71,"time we must not fail. Gentlemen, I give you the Fourth Reich. "
72,ALL: The Fourth Reich. 
73,"KARL: Herr De Flores, the aircraft is ready. "
74,DE FLORES: We leave at once. 
75,"(As the men troop out, De Flores goes to a glass display case and"
76,"removes a silver bow, then places it in a metal carrying case. "
77,"Out in space, a meteorite containing a statue starts to heat up.) "
78, [Lady Peinforte's home] 
79," RICHARD: My lady, there is but the final"
80,ingredient for the liquid wanting. For that I was thinking 
81,MATHEMATICIAN: My lady? Lady Peinforte? I've finished. 
82,PEINFORTE: You have the answer? 
83,"MATHEMATICIAN: Yes, my lady. "
84,"PEINFORTE: Quickly, then. Tell me. "
85,MATHEMATICIAN: The comet Nemesis will circle the heavens once every
86,twenty five years. 
87,PEINFORTE: Yes. 
88,"MATHEMATICIAN: It's trajectory, however, is decaying. This "
89,PEINFORTE: When will it land? 
90,MATHEMATICIAN: It will circle ever closer until finally it once again
91,"strikes the Earth at the point from which it originally departed, the"
92,meadow outside. 
93,PEINFORTE: When? 
94,"MATHEMATICIAN: When. Oh, yes. Yes, of course. On the twenty third day"
95,of November in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty eight. 
96,(Is that allowing for the 11 day calendar correction in September 1752
97,when we changed to Gregorian?) 
98, [Black Jack's Mill - garden] 
99, (The Courtney Pine Jazz quartet are playing to an
100,"appreciative audience in bright sunshine, including the Doctor and Ace"
101,- who is wearing a short sleeved t-shirt in November?) 
102,ACE: I could listen to them all afternoon. 
103,DOCTOR: And so we shall. 
104,(Ace picks up the Daily Mirror with the headline Meteor Approaches
105,England and reads the back page.) 
106,ACE: Have you seen this? Charlton picked up three points. 
107,"DOCTOR: This is my favourite kind of jazz, straight blowing. "
108,(The Doctor's pocket watch beeps.) 
109,ACE: I hate people whose alarms go off during gigs. 
110,DOCTOR: What's this? It's a reminder. 
111,"ACE: Well, go on, then. "
112,"DOCTOR: Well, obviously, at this precise moment it's a reminder to"
113,change course for another destination. 
114,(He closes the ornately enamelled cover of the digital device.) 
115,ACE: Where's that? 
116,"DOCTOR: I've forgotten. Oh, we'll have to go back and find out. "
117,"ACE: Oh, Professor. "
118,(The Doctor walks off while Ace gets Courtney to give her an
119,autograph.) 
120,"ACE: Excuse me, would you mind signing my tape? "
121,COURTNEY: Not at all. 
122,ACE: Thanks. 
123,COURTNEY: Okay. 
124,ACE: Bye. 
125,(Ace joins the Doctor.) 
126,DOCTOR: Don't you find it embarrassing asking for autographs? 
127,ACE: Not as embarrassing as forgetting what you set your alarm for. 
128,"DOCTOR: Well, I probably arranged it centuries ago. "
129,"(Someone fires a silenced handgun at them from the hedge, but misses.) "
130,ACE: Doctor! 
131,DOCTOR: Get down! 
132,"(They crouch, run, and hide by some trees.) "
133,ACE: Who are they? 
134,"DOCTOR: Couldn't see. Quick, the Tardis. "
135,"(As they run across a wooden bridge, a volley of shots sends them"
136,tumbling into the fast moving water. 
137,Two men with guns wearing headphones come onto the bridge to check
138,"their handiwork. Seeing no one, they smile and leave. Then the Doctor"
139,"and Ace surface, drift downstream a little and climb out.) "
140,ACE: Hope my tape's all right. 
141,DOCTOR: Welcome home. 
142, [Lady Peinforte's home] 
143, MATHEMATICIAN: I could build a flying machine.
144,"Imagine that, my lady. Human beings flying about like birds. "
145,PEINFORTE: Bring the cups of potion. We leave at once. 
146,"RICHARD: The final ingredient, my lady? Human blood? "
147,"MATHEMATICIAN: Why, I can change the world. "
148,"PEINFORTE: Ah, yes. "
149, [Riverside] 
150, (Ace uses a catapult to fire stones across the
151,river.) 
152,DOCTOR : Ace! 
153,ACE: Yeah? 
154,DOCTOR : Duck. 
155,(Ace ducks. The Doctor shooes a duck out of the Tardis and brings a new
156,cassette player with him.) 
157,"DOCTOR: No, duck. "
158,"ACE: Oh, great. Now I can play my tape. "
159,DOCTOR: Afraid not. 
160,ACE: Why not? It's my tape deck. You built it for me. 
161,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know I built it for you to replace the one that was"
162,"destroyed by the Daleks, but "
163,ACE: So? It's my tape deck and I want to play this. 
164,"DOCTOR: This is more than just a tape deck. And besides, we've more to"
165,worry about than just listening to your tape. 
166,"ACE: Yeah. So who were they, anyway? Who'd want to kill us? "
167,DOCTOR: I'm afraid there's an infinite number of possibilities. What
168,concerns me more is my alarm. Got to find out what it was supposed to
169,be. 
170,ACE: Can't you remember anything about it? 
171,(He inputs some data into the tape deck.) 
172,DOCTOR: I'm afraid not. Obviously the arrangements were made in rather
173,a hurry. They are important. I've given them a terminal rating. 
174,ACE: Sounds nice. 
175,DOCTOR: It means that some planet somewhere faces imminent destruction.
176,
177,ACE: Crikey. 
178,DOCTOR: Quite. 
179,(He finishes his input and a hologram of a planet appears above the
180,tape deck.) 
181,DOCTOR: That looks familiar. Earth. 
182, [Lady Peinforte's home] 
183, (Lady Peinforte and Richard stand inside a circle
184,"of astrological symbols, dead birds and animal skulls. She holds the"
185,silver arrow while They both hold a goblet.) 
186,PEINFORTE: Afraid? 
187,"RICHARD: Yes, my lady. "
188,"PEINFORTE: When I employed you, you lead me to believe you were a"
189,hardened criminal. 
190,"RICHARD: As my lady knows, before I entered your service I was found"
191,guilty of a large number of offences. 
192,PEINFORTE: Then have the courage of your convictions. Drink. Drink! 
193,(They both drain their goblets. There are flashing lights.) 
194,"RICHARD: What's happening, my lady? "
195,"PEINFORTE: We are leaving, Richard. Destiny beckons. We ride the back"
196,of time. 
197,RICHARD: No. No! No! 
198,"PEINFORTE: Come back, you fool. You'll break the aura. "
199,"RICHARD: I can't! Please, my lady. I must stay. "
200,PEINFORTE: It's too late. 
201,(They both scream as an aurora envelopes and Lady Peinforte's home
202,transforms into -) 
203, [Black Jack's Mill] 
204, (A restaurant complete with red checked
205,"tablecloths. The customers look up, surprised as a pair of seventeenth"
206,century time travellers appear in their midst.) 
207,"RICHARD: Where are we, my lady? "
208,"PEINFORTE: Why, the very place we left, of course. My house in Windsor."
209,
210, [Riverside] 
211, ACE: You mean the world's going to end and you've
212,forgotten about it? 
213,DOCTOR: I've been busy. 
214,ACE: How long have you known? 
215,"DOCTOR: Well, in strictly linear terms, as the chronometer flies, I've"
216,"known since November the twenty third, 1638. "
217,(A silver spacecraft approaches Earth.) 
218, [Cellar] 
219, (The Tardis materialises inside a cellar filled
220,"with junk, including a tiger's head. The Doctor strokes a stuffed bear"
221,and catches his hand on its teeth.) 
222,DOCTOR: Hello. Ow! 
223,ACE: Look at all this stuff. 
224,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what we've got to do, look at all this"
225,stuff. You take that aisle. 
226,ACE: What's it all for? 
227,DOCTOR: Presents. 
228,ACE: Nobody gets this many presents. 
229,"DOCTOR: Well, if you were a lady who travelled. "
230,ACE: I am. 
231,"DOCTOR: Yes, you're not always invited, but you are, you get presents,"
232,and then you need somewhere to store them. 
233,"ACE: Who does it all belong to? I mean, where are we? "
234,DOCTOR: Windsor. 
235,ACE: Windsor? We're in the castle? 
236,(The Doctor holds an African mask up.) 
237,DOCTOR: This is new. 
238,ACE: I thought it'd be a lot posher than this. 
239,"DOCTOR: It probably is, upstairs, but we're in the vault. "
240,(The Doctor has put on a fez.) 
241,DOCTOR: I'm looking for a silver bow we want to borrow. 
242,ACE: We can't go nicking stuff in here. 
243,DOCTOR: It's only temporary. 
244,ACE: It's probably treason. I'm too young to go to the Tower. 
245,"DOCTOR: Listen, Ace, do I have to remind you that the safety of the"
246,world is at stake? 
247,"ACE: It might make a difference if you'd let me know what was going on,"
248,"Professor, but I suppose there's no time. "
249,DOCTOR: Precisely. 
250,(The lights flicker.) 
251,"DOCTOR: There's even less time than I thought. Please, let's hurry. "
252,(The Doctor puts the fez on Ace.) 
253, [Black Jack's Mill] 
254, PEINFORTE: Nemesis. She arrives. 
255, [Cellar] 
256, (The meteorite crashes to earth by a barn. The
257,Doctor catches a gilt bust that tumbles off a pedestal.) 
258,ACE: Was that a bomb? 
259,"DOCTOR: No, that was the return to Earth of a comet called Nemesis that"
260,has been in orbit for exactly three hundred and fifty years. 
261,"ACE: You're amazing, Professor, being able to tell all that just from"
262,the noise. 
263,"DOCTOR: Wasn't difficult, really. It was me who launched it into space"
264,in the first place. This may qualify as the worst miscalculation since
265,life crawled out of the seas on this sad planet. 
266,"ACE: Nobody's perfect. Hey, is this the bow? "
267, [Van] 
268, (The bow is in the case on De Flores's lap. The
269,van stops.) 
270,"KARL: We're almost at Windsor, Herr De Flores. Shall I let the men walk"
271,around a little? 
272,"DE FLORES: No, Karl. We must not keep history waiting. "
273, [Black Jack's Mill] 
274," (A police car zooms past, blues and twos on.) "
275,"RICHARD: My lady, what carriage is that? "
276,PEINFORTE: Hurry. The rogues will have the Nemesis. 
277,RICHARD: I've not seen the like of it before. We must take care. 
278,"PEINFORTE: Oh, fie. "
279,(Lady Peinforte smashes the glass door with a chair.) 
280, [Van] 
281, (Police are standing by the burning hole in the
282,ground as the van pulls up nearby.) 
283,DE FLORES: Nemesis has come to Earth on that piece of ground. In the
284,"new era, all this will be a shrine. "
285,KARL: The men are ready in two assault groups. I will remain with you.
286,We await only your order. 
287,DE FLORES: Very good. Let's drive to the best hotel and refresh
288,ourselves. 
289,"KARL: But Herr De Flores, there are only three policemen. We can take"
290,"them now. You young people, always in such a hurry. Well, we were the"
291,"same. Now, the statue is inside the meteor, which has just travelled"
292,through space. Have you any idea how hot it will be? How can we handle
293,"it? Since the British Government is completely unaware of its power,"
294,I'm sure we can rely on the police force to guard it safely until we're
295,ready to collect it. I have every confidence in them. 
296, [Cellar] 
297, DOCTOR: The bow was in the case. 
298,(Ace reads the description.) 
299,"ACE: Ah. This case contained the bow of Nemesis, property of the Crown,"
300,which disappeared mysteriously in 1788. Legend has it that unless a
301,"place is kept for the bow in the Castle, the entire silver statue will"
302,return to destroy the world. 
303,DOCTOR: For once legend is absolutely correct. It has just returned. 
304,(The lights go out.) 
305,"DOCTOR: Oh, now this. "
306,ACE: It's just the electricity. 
307,(The lights come on again.) 
308,"ACE: It does that sometimes, even in the 1980s. What I want to know is,"
309,how can a statue destroy the world? 
310,DOCTOR: I'll tell you three hundred and fifty years ago. 
311,(Ace puts the fez back by the drawing of the statue with its bow and
312,arrow.) 
313, [Lady Peinforte's home] 
314," (The Tardis materialises on the upstairs landing,"
315,"blowing out the candles. The Doctor and Ace tiptoe out, then Ace"
316,sneezes.) 
317,DOCTOR: Shush. 
318,"ACE: Sorry, Professor. "
319,DOCTOR: There might be someone at home. 
320,"ACE: Okay, Professor. So where are we now? "
321,"DOCTOR: Windsor, of course. Only a few hundred yards from the Castle. "
322,ACE: And is it really 1638? 
323,"DOCTOR: It certainly is. And furthermore, don't move. "
324,ACE: What? 
325,DOCTOR: Stay where you are. 
326,"(The Doctor goes to the Mathematician, who is slumped over the table,"
327,and covers him up.) 
328,ACE: What is it? 
329,DOCTOR: Something you don't want to see. 
330,"ACE: Who does this house belong to, anyway? "
331,DOCTOR: A lady. 
332,ACE: She's got funny ideas about home furnishings. 
333,DOCTOR: Lady Peinforte's nothing if not original. I'm afraid this poor
334,man was employed for his useful rather than his ornamental qualities.
335,He's a scholar. He's done remarkably well. In a matter of months since
336,"I was last here, he's calculated the exact time and date when a comet"
337,called Nemesis will land on this planet. The twenty third of November. 
338,ACE: 1988. 
339,DOCTOR: And Lady Peinforte's rewarded him with her usual generosity. 
340,ACE: So the bow belonged to her? 
341,"DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, no, no. Not to her. To a statue of her. She made the"
342,statue from the silver metal that fell out of the sky into that meadow
343,out there. 
344,(He goes to the chess board.) 
345,"DOCTOR: Hmm, this game is going rather badly. "
346,ACE: Professor. 
347,"DOCTOR: Don't worry. There's no one here now, apart from our late"
348,"friend. Lady Peinforte's around all right, in Windsor, but three"
349,hundred and fifty years in the future. 
350, [Crash site] 
351, (Really the Greenwich peninsular before Tony Blair
352,dumped an expensive Dome on it. A policeman uses his radio.) 
353,RICHARD: What means yon fellows? One speaks into his hand. 
354,"PEINFORTE: He summons guards. Oh, this cannot be. "
355,"RICHARD: Why so upset, my lady? "
356,"PEINFORTE: Because, fool, they will protect the Nemesis, and we know"
357,not their strength and weapons. 
358,"RICHARD: But, my lady, they know not what the comet is. Without the"
359,"arrow, it is nothing. We must but watch and wait our chance to seize"
360,it. 
361,"PEINFORTE: Thou art not in all wise so useless, Richard. "
362,RICHARD: My lady is too kind. 
363,PEINFORTE: We shall withdraw and conceal ourselves. 
364,"POLICEMAN: Three one eight to base. Hey look, there's someone inside. "
365, [Lady Peinforte's home] 
366, ACE: How can she get to 1988? 
367,"DOCTOR: She uses the silver arrow, of course, and she had some basic"
368,"rudimentary knowledge about time travel. Black magic, mostly. "
369,ACE: Black magic? 
370,"DOCTOR: Mmm, and what you might call a nose for secrets. "
371,(He sniffs the liquid bubbling in the cauldron in the fireplace.) 
372,"DOCTOR: Oh, dear. "
373,"ACE: So it wasn't just silver, this stuff that fell from the sky? "
374,"DOCTOR: Unfortunately, Lady Peinforte discovered it was something"
375,rather more unusual. A living metal. Validium. 
376,ACE: Living metal? 
377,"DOCTOR: Yes, with just one purpose. Destruction. "
378,"ACE: But if you launched it into space, how come it's capable of"
379,destruction? 
380,"DOCTOR: Later, Ace. "
381, [Crash site] 
382, (The police car won't start.) 
383,"POLICEMAN: Don't bother trying again, it looks like the battery's dead."
384,
385,(A silver periscope pushes up through the soil.) 
386,POLICEMAN: Hello? Hello? 
387,(And more of them. They spray gas and the policemen collapse.) 
388, [Windsor Castle] 
389," (A bevy of tourists are on the tour, in front of a"
390,sentry box containing a red coated soldier. Windsor is being played by
391,"Arundel, another splendid castle.) "
392,GUIDE: You see here the guard. They're changed quite regularly. Of
393,"course, they're only changed in winter time. They normally stand here"
394,"all the time in summer time. Now, will you follow me, please, ladies"
395,and gentlemen? 
396,"(The Tardis materialises by the curtain wall, unnoticed.) "
397,ACE: I've been here before. 
398,DOCTOR: D�j� vu? 
399,"ACE: No, with the school. "
400,"DOCTOR: Oh, very droll. I haven't been here since they were building"
401,the place. You remember the way around? 
402,ACE: Not really. Windsor Castle's a big place. 
403,DOCTOR: Quite right. What we need's a guide. Come on. 
404,(They join the tour.) 
405,"GUIDE: Tower, and also further over there is the Mary Tudor Tower."
406,Those gargoyles have been there for about five hundred years. They were
407,"built in 1509 originally, and the "
408,"(The Doctor and Ace follow a sign saying No Admittance, Royal"
409,Apartments.) 
410, [Courtyard] 
411, ACE: I really don't think we should be doing this.
412,
413,DOCTOR: This way? What do you think? 
414,ACE: I don't know. I might be able to tell if I actually knew where we
415,were going. We didn't actually cover the Royal residential areas on the
416,school trip. There's someone coming. 
417,(A lady with a pack of Corgis around her ankles.) 
418,DOCTOR: Act as if you own the place. 
419,ACE: Do what? 
420,DOCTOR: It always works. We own the place. 
421,ACE: Doctor! 
422,DOCTOR: How annoying. I can't place that woman for the life of me. 
423,ACE: Doctor! 
424,"(Ace pulls the Doctor behind a buttress, then the woman and her dogs go"
425,back inside.) 
426,"DOCTOR: It's all right, Ace. I know that woman from somewhere. "
427,(Ace whispers to him behind the stone.) 
428,DOCTOR : What! Why didn't you say something? 
429,ACE : You wouldn't let me. 
430,"DOCTOR: She's just the woman we need. Quick, after her. Ah ha! "
431, [Landing] 
432, DOCTOR: It'll be very useful to have the armed
433,"forces and the police on our side, and can you suggest a better person"
434,to ask? 
435,ACE: Come on. 
436,DOCTOR: There's no alternative. 
437,"(The Doctor is about to knock on a door with a crown on it, when it is"
438,opened by a stern man with beard.) 
439, [Crash site] 
440," RICHARD: I am in a nightmare, or mad. "
441,PEINFORTE: This is no madness. Tis England. 
442,"RICHARD: But the noise, lady. The foul air. "
443,(Lady Peinforte holds out her hand for the long bow.) 
444,"RICHARD: Yes, my lady. What will my lady do when you possess the"
445,Nemesis? 
446,"PEINFORTE: Why, first have revenge on that predictable little man. He"
447,"will soon arrive, Richard. Oh yes, I expect him. This time there'll be"
448,"a reckoning with the nameless Doctor whose power is so secret, for I"
449,"have found his secret out. In good time, I will speak it. I shall be"
450,his downfall. 
451, [Landing] 
452, DOCTOR: I've got to speak to her. 
453,SECURITY: Be quiet. We'll have a doctor here soon. 
454,DOCTOR: But I am a doctor! 
455,SECURITY: Don't get excited. How did you get in here? 
456,"DOCTOR: I could tell you, but you won't believe me. "
457,SECURITY: Try me. 
458,DOCTOR: I travelled through time and space. 
459,"SECURITY: Oh dear, oh dear. "
460,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, very well, then. Let's forget about the armed forces. "
461,ACE: But the Queen? 
462,SECURITY: Are you a patient with him? 
463,"ACE: Now, you'd better listen to him, weasel features, 'cos he's the"
464,Doctor. 
465,"SECURITY: Oh, is he? "
466,"DOCTOR: Listen, the fate of every living creature on this planet hangs"
467,in the balance. 
468,SECURITY: I don't believe you. 
469,(The Doctor puts on a pair of round glasses.) 
470,DOCTOR: You will believe me. You will let us go. You will not move. (to
471,Ace) You will move. 
472,(The security men remain still as the Doctor and Ace head for the
473,stairs.) 
474,ACE: How did you do that? 
475,DOCTOR: It's easy once you know how. You have to make a spectacle of
476,yourself. 
477,SECURITY: Hey! 
478,"DOCTOR: Only trouble is, it doesn't last long."
479,(The men with the guns and the ear defenders have arrived at the crash
480,"site. One turns over a tape in his Walkman, then energy zaps their ear"
481,phones.) 
482, [Gallery] 
483, (The Doctor stops in front of a painting.) 
484,"DOCTOR: Oh look, a Van Dyck. "
485,"ACE: Not now, Doctor. "
486,(They push through the tour group.) 
487,"ACE: Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me. "
488,SECURITY: Excuse me. 
489, [Staircase] 
490, (The Doctor and Ace make it to the top of another
491,staircase.) 
492,ACE: What now? 
493,DOCTOR: Back to the Tardis. We're obviously not going to get any help
494,here. 
495,"(As they run down the stone staircase, Ace stops at a Gainsborough-like"
496,painting of a lady.) 
497,"ACE: Professor, that's me. "
498,"DOCTOR: What? Gosh, so it is. My goodness, what a good likeness. "
499,ACE: How come I ended up here? 
500,"DOCTOR: Well, it hasn't happened yet. "
501,ACE: But it's two hundred years ago. 
502,DOCTOR: I know. We haven't done it. That's why you don't remember it. 
503,ACE: It doesn't make sense. 
504,"DOCTOR: Well, it did to Louis Armstrong, but then he really understood"
505,time. 
506,SECURITY: There they are. Come on. 
507, [Crash site] 
508, (The neo-Nazis arrive and take up positions around
509,the Nemesis. De Flores has changed into army uniform. His men find the
510,fallen police.) 
511,"KARL: Herr De Flores, I don't understand how the police have already"
512,been overcome. 
513,DE FLORES: That is of no importance. All that matters is the Nemesis is
514,safe. 
515,(Karl places the box on the meteorite and opens it. The bow throbs with
516,"energy, and so does the statue inside the rock.) "
517,DE FLORES: Your strength returns. Soon you will be completely restored.
518,"But where's the arrow? The arrow, where is it? "
519,(The Tardis materialises by the barn.) 
520,DE FLORES: Find it. Find it! 
521,DOCTOR: I only hope we're not to late. 
522,(The Doctor and Ace run up behind the soldiers.) 
523,"DOCTOR: Er, don't be afraid. We won't harm you. "
524,"KARL: How did you get here? I searched that section, there was no one"
525,there. 
526,"DE FLORES: Never mind, Karl. You will see many signs and wonders in the"
527,days to come. Give me the arrow of Nemesis. 
528,"DOCTOR: Fortunately, I haven't seen it since 1638, when it disappeared"
529,along with the good Lady Peinforte. 
530,DE FLORES: Rubbish. You. Where is the arrow? 
531,ACE: I don't know anything about it. 
532,"DOCTOR: She really doesn't. Allow me to explain, Ace. "
533,(The Doctor turns his back on the soldiers and stands in front of Ace.)
534,
535,"DOCTOR: For the validium to become active, it must have a sufficient"
536,quantity of critical mass. The statue alone is no good without the bow.
537,
538,DE FLORES: I have the bow. 
539,"DOCTOR: And the arrow. Now, if someone could put the bow and arrow into"
540,the statue's hands 
541,"DE FLORES: They have the power of life and death, not only over this"
542,Earth but any planet in existence. You seem remarkably well-informed
543,for someone who claims to know nothing. 
544,"DOCTOR: I simply notice what is obvious. You, apparently, don't. "
545,DE FLORES: What do you mean? 
546,DOCTOR: You see those policemen there? They've been attacked by
547,technology more advanced and more terrible than you could imagine. 
548,KARL: What technology? 
549,DOCTOR: And you might also have observed the electricity supply being
550,drained over the last few days. 
551,ACE: Like at the Castle? 
552,DOCTOR: Yes. 
553,DE FLORES: Tell me where the arrow is. I want you to tell me where to
554,find the arrow! 
555,DOCTOR: I'm glad to say I can't. 
556,DE FLORES: Then we will shoot her. 
557,ACE: Doctor. 
558,(A silver spacecraft comes in to land.) 
559,DE FLORES: Wait. 
560,DOCTOR: Don't move! 
561,(Figures march out of the spacecraft.) 
562,ACE: They saved my life. 
563,DOCTOR: Don't thank them yet. We might live to regret it. 
564,ACE: What are they? 
565,DOCTOR: Cybermen. 
566, Part Two
567,
568, [Crash site] 
569," LEADER: So, Doctor, a new appearance, otherwise"
570,our anticipation of your presence has proved entirely accurate. 
571,"(De Flores' men start shooting at the silver newcomers, with no"
572,effect.) 
573,LEADER: Eradicate them. 
574,(The Doctor and Ace hit the ground as the Cybermen kill the neo-Nazis.)
575,
576,DOCTOR: Take cover. 
577,(The Doctor runs and dives into the crater made by the Nemesis.) 
578,ACE: Doctor! 
579,(She follows him as the battle rages around the grounds.) 
580,"ACE: Doctor, we can't stay here. "
581,DOCTOR: We certainly can. This exactly the same thing that happened the
582,last time. Only then it was the Roundheads and Lady Peinforte. 
583,(Lady Peinforte fires an arrow directly into a Cyberman's chest unit
584,whilst Richard says fervent prayers.) 
585,PEINFORTE: A hit. A very palpable hit. 
586,(The Cyberman dies. It must be a gold tipped arrow then. A second arrow
587,hits the ground near where De Flores is hiding behind an old car. He
588,examines it carefully as more of his men are slaughtered. Another
589,Cyberman falls to Lady Peinforte's golden arrows.) 
590,"PEINFORTE: See how my poison is as deadly as ever, Richard. "
591,"RICHARD: And I shall look after the sick. Which reminds me, I shall"
592,return to Briggs his money. 
593,"PEINFORTE: Get up, fool. I tell thee, Richard, were there men of silver"
594,"like these here in our day, my life would have been quite different."
595,"Now I'll let them destroy each other, and then we'll take the Nemesis. "
596,(An explosion destroys the police car. A dead Cyberman topples into the
597,crater.) 
598,DOCTOR: Where did that come from? 
599,ACE: Didn't see. 
600,"DOCTOR: A Cyberman killed with an arrow? But that's ludicrous, unless."
601,"Of course, the head's made of gold. "
602,ACE: That's real gold? 
603,DOCTOR: Yes. The only substance to which they're vulnerable. 
604,ACE: Classy. 
605,(Ace tries to grab the arrow but the Doctor pushes her off.) 
606,DOCTOR: Ah! Gold dipped in poison. Lady Peinforte's calling card. 
607,"ACE: I really think we should be getting out of here, Doctor. "
608,DOCTOR: I really think you're right. 
609,"RICHARD: My lady, who is that little man? "
610,"PEINFORTE: Oh, glorious evil. It is he. "
611,(The Doctor snatches the bow from the box on top of the Nemesis and
612,runs for the Tardis.) 
613,PEINFORTE: No! 
614,"(She takes aim with her bow, but they get inside just in time. The"
615,Tardis dematerialises with an arrow stuck in the door.) 
616,DE FLORES: We must retreat. It's our only chance. 
617,KARL: And leave the statue? 
618,DE FLORES: The statue alone is useless to them. The bow is ours. Get
619,it. 
620,(Karl runs to the crater and retrieves the box under fire.) 
621,LEADER: Bring the bow at once. 
622,"CYBERMAN: The Doctor and the female have escaped with it, Leader. "
623,LEADER: And that one? 
624,(It points to a Cyberman with an arrow in its chest.) 
625,"CYBERMAN: Terminated by another human female, using gold. "
626,LEADER: This must be the Lady Peinforte. 
627, [Windsor town] 
628, (Lady Peinforte and Richard walk down an alley to
629,a main street where people are queuing at a bus stop across the way.) 
630,"RICHARD: My lady, there are people here. "
631,PEINFORTE: Of course there are people. This is Windsor. Come. 
632, [Warehouse] 
633, (The Cybermen have brought the Nemesis into a
634,"large warehouse or aircraft hanger by its crash site, and are cutting"
635,into the rock surrounding it.) 
636,LEADER: Cut the statue free and take it into the craft. 
637, [Lady Peinforte's home] 
638, ACE: I don't like this place. 
639,"DOCTOR: We're just passing through, Ace. "
640,ACE: What happened to the body? It's gone. 
641,DOCTOR: Yes. Someone's moved the chess pieces. 
642,(The Doctor rifles through the papers on the desk and produces a small
643,card.) 
644,DOCTOR: Voila! 
645,ACE: Is that what we came here for? 
646,"DOCTOR: Our friend the mathematician was a genius, but he needed a"
647,little help to get started. 
648,(The Doctor burns the paper in the fire.) 
649,DOCTOR: Cold? 
650,ACE: I really don't like this place. Can we make a move? 
651,DOCTOR: Yes. 
652,(He moves a piece on the chess board and they leave. 
653, [Van] 
654," (The Cybermen carry the Nemesis, still in some"
655,"rock, into their spacecraft, then take off. "
656,Lady Peinforte and Richard attract the attention of a pair of thugs as
657,they walk down through Windsor. 
658,Meanwhile De Flores tips gold dust out of a small bag into his hand.) 
659,"KARL: What is the gold dust for, Herr De Flores? "
660,DE FLORES: Eventualities. 
661, [Windsor Great Park] 
662, (The Tardis materialises next to an old wooden
663,signpost.) 
664,"DOCTOR: Validium was created as the ultimate defence for Gallifrey,"
665,back in early times. 
666,ACE: Created by Omega? 
667,DOCTOR: Yes. 
668,"(He closes the door carefully, looking at the arrow. Ace is carrying"
669,the silver bow and her tape deck.) 
670,ACE: And? 
671,DOCTOR: Rassilon. 
672,ACE: And? 
673,"DOCTOR: And none of it should have left Gallifrey. But, as always with"
674,"these things, some of it did. "
675,(He takes the bow and holds it out in front of himself at arms length
676,like an aerial.) 
677,ACE: So you had to stop Lady Peinforte. 
678,DOCTOR: Or anyone else. 
679,ACE: From ever putting the three bits together. 
680,(They start walking down a track with the castle in the far distance
681,over a ridge.) 
682,"DOCTOR: Yes, so I launched the largest piece into space. "
683,ACE: But you got the sums wrong. 
684,DOCTOR: Look. We're almost there. 
685,ACE: I'd feel a lot safer and happier inside the Tardis. 
686,"DOCTOR: Well, the Cybermen might find the Tardis. This way, our"
687,validium leads us to their validium. 
688,ACE: Isn't that a bit old-fashioned? 
689,DOCTOR: I'm an old-fashioned guy. 
690,(The Cyber-spaceship comes in to land.) 
691, [Windsor town] 
692, (The two thugs confront Lady Peinforte and
693,"Richard, itching for a fight.) "
694,SKINHEAD: You looking at me? 
695,PEINFORTE: Stand aside. 
696,"SKINHEAD 2: What are you, social workers? "
697,RICHARD: Out of my lady's way. 
698,SKINHEAD: We want to tell you our problems. 
699,PEINFORTE: Will you be turned into rats? 
700,SKINHEAD 2: We already have been. 
701,SKINHEAD: Poor ones. That's our problem. 
702,SKINHEAD 2: Money! 
703,"RICHARD: Money, say you? "
704, [Crypt] 
705," (The bow is flashing and humming, and the Doctor"
706,and Ace are whistling almost in tune with it as they walk towards the
707,Castle. 
708,The Cybermen have brought the Nemesis to a tall folly cum crypt in the
709,ground. Actually Hiorne's Tower at Arundel. On the wall behind the
710,large stone sarcophagus is the inscription Death Is But A Door. The
711,Nemesis is starting to break out of her rock prison.) 
712,"CYBERMAN: The remaining validium approaches, Leader. "
713,LEADER: As predicted. Activate communications unit. 
714,CYBERMAN: But the Doctor and Peinforte are still to be destroyed. 
715,"LEADER: Our victory is inevitable. The Doctor will come to us, and"
716,Peinforte is a simple savage accompanied by a terrified peasant. 
717, [Windsor Great Park] 
718," (The two thugs have been bound, gagged and are"
719,hanging by their heels from a large tree branch while their clothes
720,burn nearby. 
721,"Elsewhere, Ace sets up the tape deck as an aerial.) "
722,ACE: What am I supposed to be listening for? 
723,"(There is a loud beep, beep, and the Doctor turns it off.) DOCTOR: That. Cybermen communicating. "
724,ACE: I don't like Cybermen. 
725,DOCTOR: You should see the ones they're communicating with. 
726,ACE: Reinforcements? 
727,DOCTOR: Yes. But if we could only jam their signal. Have you got a
728,tape? 
729,ACE: Yeah. You mean this thing transmits? 
730,(She puts the tape into the play deck.) 
731,DOCTOR: Of course it does. I built it. 
732, [Crypt] 
733, LEADER: Commence transmission. 
734,"CYBERMAN: Leader, I must repeat the objection to the transmission of"
735,incorrect information. Our forces do not yet hold all three units of
736,validium. 
737,LEADER: You are outside your function. 
738,(The communications globe glows.) 
739, [Windsor Great Park] 
740, (The Doctor and Ace are lying on the slope
741,listening to Courtney Pine's tape.) 
742,DOCTOR: Are we having fun? 
743,ACE: Yeah. 
744, [Crypt] 
745," CYBERMAN: Interference, origin unknown. "
746,LEADER: Open the monitor channel. 
747,(Jazz blares out.) 
748, [Windsor Great Park] 
749, ACE: That'll keep them busy. Time to go? 
750,"DOCTOR: Oh, I do love a jam session. "
751,"(As the jazz sounds out across the galaxy, the Doctor and Ace start"
752,walking again. Eventually they come across the skinheads still hanging
753,from the tree. The Doctor gives Ace the bow and runs over to them.) 
754,DOCTOR: This is ridiculous. Who did this to you? 
755,SKINHEAD: Social workers. 
756, [Outside the Crypt] 
757, (A strange growling yowling noise can be heard.) 
758,RICHARD: My lady. 
759,PEINFORTE: Of course I heard it. Am I deaf? 
760,"RICHARD: It sounds like a bear, but worse. "
761,(Lady Peinforte's silver bow glows.) 
762,"PEINFORTE: See, we're near the Nemesis. Come. The bear will not pursue"
763,us. Such things happen only in the theatre. 
764,RICHARD: What creatures are these? 
765,(They are llamas.) 
766,PEINFORTE: I know not. 
767,"RICHARD: They will eat us. I beg you, my lady, return us to our own"
768,time. The England now is full of terrors. 
769,PEINFORTE: You're mad! Return without the Nemesis? Never. And without
770,"my knowledge, you cannot return at all. I tell you, Richard, either you"
771,"assist me to regain it or I leave thee here forever. Now, come. I think"
772,they are peaceful. 
773,"RICHARD: What place, what place is this? "
774,"PEINFORTE: The piece of ground on which you stand? Well, I will tell"
775,"thee. It is thy grave, Richard. "
776,RICHARD: What? 
777,"PEINFORTE: I ordered you to be buried here when I planned my tomb. See,"
778,there's thy stone. 
779,"(Here Lyeth the Body of Richard Maynarde, departed this life ye 2nd"
780,November 1657 in the 51st year of his Age. He saw worlds end and
781,begin.) 
782,"PEINFORTE: If the dogs would not eat thee, I ordered you put out here"
783,to attend me in the next world as in this. There you see is my burial
784,"place, and aptly the silver creatures there do hold the Nemesis. We"
785,shall attack. 
786,(We pull back to see a sign near the llamas which reads - Stay in your
787,car while in the safari park. 
788,(The Doctor and Ace look round the trunk of a large tree.) 
789,DOCTOR: Just in time. 
790, [Crypt] 
791," RICHARD: There's nothing here, my lady. "
792,"PEINFORTE: See the arrow? The statue's here, depend upon it. "
793, [Outside the Crypt] 
794, LEADER: Now our plan begins to operate. She will
795,find that her crypt has weathered with age. The fact of her death will
796,drive her insane. 
797, [Crypt] 
798, RICHARD: This is your tomb? 
799,"PEINFORTE: Rather fine, is it not? But where is the statue of Nemesis? "
800, [Outside the Crypt] 
801, PEINFORTE : Where is it? Where? 
802,"CYBERMAN: Is this the human condition of madness, Leader? "
803,LEADER: It is. Kill them. 
804,PEINFORTE : It must be here. It must be! 
805, [Crypt] 
806, (Richard stands guard with his bow.) 
807,RICHARD: My lady! 
808,PEINFORTE: It is here! The arrow tells me. How can this be? Where?
809,Where is it? 
810,(Richard looses an arrow at the returning Cybermen.) 
811, [Outside the Crypt] 
812, (A Cyberman touches the arrow with a detector.) 
813,CYBERMAN: Gold! 
814,(They withdraw. Richard's second shot hits its chest unit and kills
815,it.) 
816, [Van] 
817, (De Flores consults a map.) 
818,"DE FLORES: This was once the estate of the infamous Lady Peinforte, in"
819,the seventeenth century. 
820,"KARL: Lady Peinforte? But Herr De Flores, we've seen a woman in"
821,"seventeenth century dress today, firing arrows at us and at men of"
822,silver. 
823,DE FLORES: Shut up. 
824, [Outside the spacecraft] 
825, (The Doctor and Ace observe the Cyber spacecraft
826,from underneath a hedge. It is guarded by the two headphone wearing men
827,"who knocked them into the river. Ace sneezes, so the Doctor shakes a"
828,branch and whistles like a bird. The men decide not to investigate.) 
829,DOCTOR: I don't suppose you've completely ignored my instructions and
830,"secretly prepared any Nitro Nine, have you? "
831,ACE: What if I had? 
832,DOCTOR: Naturally you wouldn't do anything so insanely dangerous as to
833,"carry it around with you, would you? "
834,ACE: Of course not. I'm a good girl. I do what I'm told. 
835,DOCTOR: Excellent. Blow up that vehicle. 
836,"(Ace grins, and picks up her rucksack.) "
837, [Outside the Crypt] 
838, LEADER: Destroy them. Destroy them! 
839,"CYBERMAN: We cannot sustain these losses, Leader. We must withdraw. "
840,LEADER: No. We must hold the statue and retrieve the arrow from them. 
841,"CYBERMAN: If we are overcome, the entire strategy fails. The Cyber race"
842,will cease to exist. 
843,LEADER: Your logic is correct. Their supply of gold is limited.
844,Retreat. 
845, [Crypt] 
846," PEINFORTE: Of course. Help me, Richard. Tis in my"
847,tomb. Help me! 
848, [Outside the spacecraft] 
849, (The Doctor emerges from the hedgerow.) 
850,"DOCTOR: Hello, I'm the Doctor! I believe you want to kill me. "
851,"(The Doctor runs and the men follow. Ace runs to the spacecraft, throws"
852,the rucksack inside then runs back to the hedgerow. KaBOOM! Karl and De
853,Flores see the fireball and drive towards it. Ace rejoins the Doctor as
854,the men go to the Cybermen.) 
855, [Outside the Crypt] 
856, LEADER: Betrayal. Kill them. 
857,"ACE: They killed them, just cos I blew up the ship. "
858,DOCTOR: They were dead already. The Cybermen had transformed them. They
859,were no longer human beings. 
860,"ACE: Is that why the Cybermen saved my life, so they could do that to"
861,me too? 
862,DOCTOR: Probably. They were like people themselves before they turned
863,themselves into Cybermen. Quite a lot of human beings are trying to
864,follow their example. 
865, [Crypt] 
866, (Richard has opened the top of the sarcophagus.) 
867,"RICHARD: My lady, where are your bones? "
868,PEINFORTE: What matter? 
869, [Windsor Great Park] 
870, DOCTOR: Are we still jamming them? 
871,ACE: Tape's still running. 
872,DOCTOR: Good. Let's see who's listening to it. 
873,(He turns up the volume.) 
874,"DOCTOR: Ah, sweet. "
875, [Clearing] 
876, (Karl and De Flores meet the Cybermen in a
877,clearing.) 
878,DE FLORES: We want to talk to you. I don't know if you're familiar with
879,"Wagner's Ring das Nibelungen. Now we, we are the supermen, but you, you"
880,are the giants. They are wonderful creatures. 
881,"LEADER: Of course, but why should we form an alliance with you? "
882,DE FLORES: We had a leader once. He predicted your coming. Now together
883,we shall fulfil his vision and reign over this world. 
884,LEADER: Together? The Cyber race requires no help from humans. 
885,KARL: But a woman who is almost less that human now holds the statue. 
886,DE FLORES: And she's armed with the most primitive toys. 
887,LEADER: You insult us. 
888,DE FLORES: Of course not. Whatever your unfortunate vulnerability
889,doesn't affect us. We can remove her for you. 
890,"LEADER: We accept. Destroy the woman and her servant, and we will"
891,divide the planet into your slave groups and ours. 
892,DE FLORES: Good. 
893,"LEADER: But remember, betrayal will be fatal. We are invincible to your"
894,weapons. 
895,DE FLORES: Come with me. 
896,(De Flores and Karl leave.) 
897,"LEADER: Once they have the arrow and the statue, destroy them. "
898, [Windsor Great Park] 
899, (The hologram above the tape deck is empty.) 
900,DOCTOR: Anything there? 
901,ACE: Why am I doing this? 
902,DOCTOR: That handful back there aren't the only Cybermen in the
903,universe. We've got to find out where the others are. 
904,"ACE: Look, this is where the signal's being received, right? "
905,DOCTOR: Right. 
906,ACE: But according to the scanner there's nothing there. 
907,DOCTOR: Then the scanner's wrong. That lot were only the advance party.
908,"Out there somewhere's the entire Cyberforce, and they want the Nemesis"
909,more than anything else in space. 
910,ACE: How can you be so sure? 
911,DOCTOR: Because it's 1988. 
912,ACE: Huh. That makes sense. 
913,"DOCTOR: Listen, Ace. The Nemesis generates destruction. It affects"
914,"everything around it. I launched it into space, but unfortunately with"
915,an orbit that brings it back to Earth every twenty five years. Take the
916,twentieth century. It appeared in 1913. 
917,ACE: The eve of the First World War. 
918,DOCTOR: Twenty five years later? 
919,ACE: 1938. 
920,DOCTOR: Hitler annexes Austria. 
921,ACE: 1963? 
922,DOCTOR: Kennedy assassinated. 
923,ACE: 1988. 
924,DOCTOR: Check the scanner again. 
925,(Elsewhere - ) 
926,"DE FLORES: Unfortunately, Wagner must be rewritten. The supermen must"
927,control the giants. Only two illiterates stand between ourselves and
928,the Fuhrer's dream. Come. 
929, [Crypt] 
930, (The statue is uncovered in the sarcophagus.) 
931,PEINFORTE: How perfect you are. Immaculate beauty carved in absolute
932,evil. 
933,"RICHARD: But your bones, my lady? They should be buried "
934,"PEINFORTE: What matter? They are dead, but I live, and soon I shall"
935,have the bow and my Nemesis shall be complete. 
936,(A gunshot makes Richard duck.) 
937,"PEINFORTE: We are attacked! Quickly, arrows. "
938,"RICHARD: We have but one left, my lady. I doubt that our arrows can"
939,stop these weapons anyway. 
940,PEINFORTE: Nonsense. Make it count. They killed the silver creatures. 
941,(More shots hit the stonework.) 
942,"RICHARD: See, lady, we have no chance! "
943,PEINFORTE: Nonsense. No man shall take the Nemesis. Her might is mine! 
944,(Richard fires the last poisoned arrow.) 
945,PEINFORTE: Not for nothing did I design my own tomb. Death is but a
946,door. 
947,(She presses a carving and a door opens in the wall.) 
948,"PEINFORTE: I always knew I'd cheat it. Here, help me with the statue. "
949,"RICHARD: We can't lift it, my lady. We must fly! "
950,KARL: Put up your hands. 
951,PEINFORTE: Never! 
952,"RICHARD: You want the statue, master? Here, take it. Take it. "
953,PEINFORTE: No! 
954,(Richard snatches the silver arrow from Lady Peinforte.) 
955,RICHARD: Give her the arrow. See! 
956,(Richard throws the arrow into the sarcophagus.) 
957,"RICHARD: Forgive me, my lady. "
958,PEINFORTE: Unhand me now! 
959,(Richard drags Lady Peinforte out through the new door. Karl fires and
960,misses.) 
961,PEINFORTE : No! 
962,"DE FLORES: No matter, Karl, no matter. They are of no importance. We"
963,"have the statue, the arrow, and the bow. "
964,(The Nemesis's hand reaches for the arrow.) 
965,KARL: And the Cybermen? 
966,DE FLORES: Gold overcomes them. We have no such weakness. See how it
967,prepares for life. Your first task must be to take control of the
968,extraterrestrials. 
969,(The Cyber Leader enters behind them.) 
970,"LEADER: Unfortunately, that will not be possible. "
971,DE FLORES: Keep away. I possess the entire statue of Nemesis. All power
972,is mine. The life and death of everything in existence is in my hands. 
973,LEADER: Then where is the bow? 
974,(De Flores opens the case and discovered that it is empty.) 
975, [Windsor Great Park] 
976, (Ace is still staring at the scanner. The Doctor
977,spots a lizard amongst the foliage.) 
978,DOCTOR: Of course. It's so simple. They're shrouded. 
979,ACE: You what? 
980,DOCTOR: Shrouded. They don't show up. But we must try and force them
981,into revealing themselves. Treble. Bass. Please let me be right. Is
982,anyone listening? Balance. 
983,(The scanner fills with the Cyber fleet.) 
984,ACE: What are they? 
985,DOCTOR: Cyber warships. Thousands of them. They were invisible. 
986, Part Three
987,
988, [Windsor Great Park] 
989, (The Doctor turns off the scanner.) 
990,ACE: What can we do? 
991,"DOCTOR: I think our best move is to go to the crypt, unarmed, with the"
992,bow. 
993,"ACE: Professor, are you losing your marbles? "
994,(The Doctor takes a handful of marbles from his pocket and pours them
995,into Ace's hands.) 
996,DOCTOR: We've got to get the bow into the statue's hands in order to
997,activate the validium. 
998,ACE: Is this the only way? 
999,DOCTOR: I believe in the direct approach. You can always go back to the
1000,Tardis. 
1001,ACE: Are we going or what? 
1002, [Crypt] 
1003, (De Flores tips some gold dust into his palm then
1004,turns around to face the Cybermen.) 
1005,"DE FLORES: Surely we, er, we can negotiate this er, this"
1006,misunderstanding? 
1007,LEADER: Our understanding is perfect. You thought you had all three
1008,"components of the statue, and naturally wished to destroy us. "
1009,KARL: You are completely mistaken. 
1010,LEADER: Silence. 
1011,"CYBERMAN: Validium activity indicates proximity of the bow, Leader. "
1012,LEADER: Excellent. Kill them. 
1013,"(De Flores throws the gold dust at the Leader, but is aiming at its"
1014,"head, not chest unit. It staggers back briefly as De Flores and Karl"
1015,walk out.) 
1016, [Outside the Crypt] 
1017, (A Cyberman follows them.) 
1018,KARL: Herr De Flores. 
1019,"DE FLORES: You fool, they're going to kill us. "
1020,KARL: Your day is over. 
1021,DE FLORES: You betray me? Have I taught you nothing? 
1022,KARL: Everything. Which is why we now part company. I'm afraid you
1023,failed to understand history in addition to Wagner. 
1024,DE FLORES: I? 
1025,"KARL: Supermen are all very well, but the giants are the master race. "
1026,(The Cyber Leader comes outside.) 
1027,KARL: Here he is. Now make me one of you. 
1028,LEADER: You show potential. Very well. Have them programmed at once. 
1029,(Two Cybermen take Karl and De Flores back inside the tower.) 
1030,LEADER: We must complete the statue immediately. Locate the bow.
1031,Destroy the Doctor and his young friend. 
1032,(Richard leads the Lady Peinforte up some steps from below the base of
1033,the tower.) 
1034,"RICHARD: How is it with you, my lady? "
1035,PEINFORTE: I understand not. 
1036,RICHARD: What's to understand? 
1037,"PEINFORTE: Always I have treated you badly. I have done you no service,"
1038,"shown you no kindness, and yet you risk your life to save me. Why so? "
1039,RICHARD: Should I not? 
1040,PEINFORTE: I do not live in the world of what should. But you're a good
1041,"man, Richard, and I am evil. "
1042,"RICHARD: My lady, we have no more weapons. "
1043,"PEINFORTE: No, you're wrong. I have one more yet that will not fail. My"
1044,knowledge. I will have the statue of Nemesis. 
1045, [Windsor Great Park] 
1046, ACE: Doctor. 
1047,DOCTOR: Ace? 
1048,"ACE: Look, let's be honest, right? I've never really bottled out of"
1049,"anything before, have I, but I'm really, really scared, Doctor. "
1050,"DOCTOR: Oh, Ace. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Why don't you go back to the"
1051,"Tardis? You'll be safe there, whatever happens. "
1052,"ACE: No chance, Doctor. No chance. "
1053, [Crypt] 
1054, (De Flores and Karl have been fitted with
1055,headphones.) 
1056,"CYBERMAN: The Cyberfleet are still not receiving our transmission,"
1057,Leader. 
1058,LEADER: Is there any pattern to the jamming signal? 
1059,"(The Cyberman turns on the monitor channel, and jazz is heard.) "
1060,CYBERMAN: It is meaningless. 
1061,"(As the Doctor and Ace run towards the tower, the tape stops. The"
1062,communications unit light comes on.) 
1063,"CYBERMAN: Communication channels to the Cyberfleet are clear again,"
1064,Leader. 
1065,LEADER: Excellent. Their arrival is imminent. 
1066,DE FLORES: You fool. Without the bow the statue's power is nothing. 
1067,LEADER: We will shortly obtain the bow. 
1068,DE FLORES: From the Doctor? Don't delude yourself. He is no common
1069,adversary. Do you think he'll simply walk in here and hand it over? 
1070,DOCTOR: Good afternoon. 
1071,LEADER: Doctor. 
1072,"DOCTOR: Yes, here we are. I'm sorry we couldn't have been here earlier,"
1073,but we were held up on the way. I don't believe you've met my friend
1074,Ace. 
1075,LEADER: Give me the bow. 
1076,DOCTOR: Cyberleader moves pawn to discover check. 
1077,ACE: Ace replies by neatly castling with the bow. 
1078,LEADER: Give me the bow. 
1079,DOCTOR: Doctor en passant behind Cyberleader. 
1080,LEADER: Give me the bow! 
1081,(The Doctor grabs the bow with his umbrella.) 
1082,DOCTOR: Doctor supports combination gambit. 
1083,LEADER: Take the bow from him. 
1084,DOCTOR: Middle game element with Cybermen. 
1085,"(The Doctor pirouettes to the sarcophagus, putting his hat over a"
1086,Cyberman's gun.) 
1087,LEADER: Kill him! 
1088,"DOCTOR: End game. Illegal move, but checkmate! "
1089,"(The Doctor gives the bow to Nemesis to activate it, then takes it"
1090,back.) 
1091,DOCTOR: That seems to be in order. 
1092,(The Doctor takes back his hat.) 
1093,DOCTOR: Run! 
1094, [Outside the Crypt] 
1095, DOCTOR: The Tardis. 
1096,ACE: No statue? 
1097,"DOCTOR: Now it's awake, it'll follow the bow. "
1098,(The glowing silver statue stands up and there are small explosions
1099,around her. A piercing scream splits the air as fire blows out of the
1100,windows of the tower.) 
1101, [Windsor Great Park] 
1102, (Lady Peinforte hears it.) 
1103,"PEINFORTE: Fear not, Richard. It is the Nemesis come alive. "
1104,RICHARD: Alive? 
1105,"PEINFORTE: Why, yes. Which means it is complete, and now it shall be"
1106,mine. 
1107,(The Tardis dematerialises.) 
1108,"PEINFORTE: All power, all power past, present and future, shall be"
1109,"mine. Why, I shall be mistress of all of that is, all that shall be,"
1110,"all that ever was. Yes, all! All! "
1111,"RICHARD: My lady, let us find some shelter. "
1112,PEINFORTE: How dare you! I shall lead and you follow! 
1113, [Lady Peinforte's home] 
1114, (The Doctor is staring at the chess board in 1638
1115,while Ace rolls up the mathematicians papers.) 
1116,"ACE: Hey, why are we here? What's going on, Professor? "
1117,DOCTOR: Unfinished business. We don't want those to fall into the wrong
1118,"hands, just yet. "
1119,ACE: How's the game going? 
1120,DOCTOR: Black's losing. 
1121,ACE: What happens to these calculations? 
1122,DOCTOR: Bishop takes rook. Someone steals them. 
1123,"ACE: The same person who steals the bow? I mean, the same person who"
1124,steals it in 1788? 
1125,"DOCTOR: How should I know, Ace? Questions, questions. Queen takes"
1126,bishop. 
1127,ACE: Who brought validium to Earth in the first place? 
1128,DOCTOR: But pawn takes queen. 
1129,"ACE: What's really going on, Doctor? "
1130,DOCTOR: Checkmate. Black wins. Time to go. Take those gold coins. We
1131,may need them. 
1132, [Road] 
1133, (Lady Peinforte and Richard see a hitchhiker get a
1134,lift in a car.) 
1135,"PEINFORTE: We needs must walk, Richard. We have no carriage. "
1136,"RICHARD: We can avail ourselves of one of these steeds, my lady. I see"
1137,the method. Sit you here and rest awhile. 
1138,(Lady Peinforte settles herself on a stone seat built into the estate
1139,wall. Richard goes to the side of the road and sticks his thumb out. A
1140,"car drives straight past him, then a second. Lady Peinforte sings to"
1141,herself as she waits.) 
1142, [Crypt] 
1143, LEADER: The Doctor must not lead the statue back
1144,to the rocket sleds. We will stop him. 
1145, [Warehouse] 
1146, (The Tardis materialises.) 
1147,"DOCTOR: Ah. Now, the statue should be here any moment now. Everything"
1148,depends on my final calculations. I can't get my figures wrong this
1149,time. 
1150,"ACE: It's okay, Professor. I promise not to interrupt you. "
1151,DOCTOR: You are interrupting me. 
1152,ACE: Sorry. 
1153,DOCTOR: There's also another slight problem. The Cybermen could be here
1154,at any moment. 
1155,"ACE: Don't worry, Doctor. I'll look after you. "
1156,(Ace takes a catapult from her belt.) 
1157,DOCTOR: Aim at the chest panel. And I trust you remember my strict
1158,instructions never to cause any further explosions? 
1159,"ACE: I'm a better person as a result, Doctor. "
1160,DOCTOR: Good. We're ready for anything. 
1161,(Ace goes to place the Nitro Nine flask.) 
1162, [Road] 
1163, PEINFORTE: All will be mine. 
1164,(Richard is still failing to get a lift. Lady Peinforte gets up as a
1165,stretched limousine approaches and holds up her hand.) 
1166, [Limousine] 
1167, (The rich American lady in the back is played by  Dolores Gray.) 
1168,"REMINGTON: Er, Cyril, honey, pull the automobile over. There's some"
1169,people there who could use a lift. 
1170,(The car stops and the window winds down.) 
1171,REMINGTON: Where are you folks headed? 
1172,"RICHARD: To Windsor, and it please you, ma'am. "
1173,"REMINGTON: It surely does, honey. Jump right in. "
1174, [Crypt] 
1175, (Karl has disposed of his headphones and the
1176,Cybermen.) 
1177,"KARL: Herr De Flores, your day is over. "
1178,(He takes De Flores's headphones off.) 
1179,DE FLORES: (laughs) You betray me. Have I taught you nothing. 
1180,"KARL: We completely deceived them, Herr De Flores. "
1181,DE FLORES: Even I thought for a moment we were finished. I am not
1182,"afraid of death, only of failing in my duty. "
1183, [Warehouse] 
1184, (The Doctor climbs into the rocket sled with the
1185,bow. The statue arrives and floats in beside him.) 
1186,"DOCTOR: Now, ah yes, the bow. The bow. The bow is essential. You shall"
1187,have the bow. 
1188,(The Nemesis takes the bow.) 
1189, [Limousine] 
1190, REMINGTON: You must be parched from standing in
1191,the sun. May I offer you a little refreshment? 
1192,"RICHARD: Thank you, no, madam. "
1193,REMINGTON: Oh. Are you folks students? 
1194,"RICHARD: Alas, I am but a servant, and cannot read or write. "
1195,REMINGTON: Oh. 
1196,"RICHARD: My mistress is of noble birth, and has some Latin and a little"
1197,Greek. 
1198,"REMINGTON: Well, you must be on vacation at this time. "
1199,"RICHARD: Go you far, ma'am? "
1200,"REMINGTON: Far? Oh, I just came over from London. "
1201,RICHARD: Two days ride. 
1202,"REMINGTON: Well, no, actually the traffic was pretty reasonable. I left"
1203,"about, let's see, forty minutes ago. "
1204,RICHARD: Forty minutes? 
1205,REMINGTON: Folks from the south are never in a hurry. As a matter of
1206,"fact, I'm here on a visit, checking out my roots. "
1207,"RICHARD: Tis wise with crops this time of year, ma'am. "
1208,REMINGTON: Oh. 
1209, [Warehouse] 
1210," (While the Doctor programmes the rocket sled, Ace"
1211,walks up to look at the statue.) 
1212,"NEMESIS: I am beautiful, am I not? "
1213,ACE: Yes. You're very beautiful. 
1214,NEMESIS: It is only my present form. I have had others which would
1215,horrify you. I shall have those again. You are surprised I speak? 
1216,ACE: I know you're living metal. 
1217,NEMESIS: I am whatever I am made to be. This time Lady Peinforte called
1218,"me Nemesis, so I am retribution. "
1219,ACE: Catch you later. 
1220, [Limousine] 
1221," REMINGTON: Well, my family came from around here."
1222,I traced them all the way back to the sixteen hundreds. 
1223,PEINFORTE: All things will soon be mine. 
1224,"REMINGTON: I guess they will, honey. "
1225,"PEINFORTE: Time past, present and future. Power invincible. "
1226, [Warehouse] 
1227," (Ace runs to the doorway and a Cyberman enters,"
1228,"firing. She runs back and up the steps to a landing outside an office,"
1229,gets out her catapult and sends a gold coin straight into its chest
1230,unit. The other Cybermen enter and see the body.) 
1231,LEADER: Destroy the human female. Find and destroy her! 
1232, [Limousine] 
1233, PEINFORTE: The secret of the heavens. 
1234,"REMINGTON: Virginia is heaven, if you ask me. My family owns a little"
1235,"land there. They used to own a little land around here, too. The"
1236,Remingtons of Remington Grange. 
1237,PEINFORTE: I know them. Thieves and swindlers all. 
1238,REMINGTON: You study history? 
1239,PEINFORTE: Dorothea Remington did bribe away my cook. 
1240,"REMINGTON: Oh. Now, let me see. Yes, there was a Dorothea. She died in"
1241,sixteen 
1242,PEINFORTE: Twenty one. Twas a slow poison. 
1243,REMINGTON: This is unbelievable. 
1244,PEINFORTE: Many found it so. 
1245,"REMINGTON: Here I am, driving around, and I pick up someone who's"
1246,researched my family tree. 
1247,PEINFORTE: We ride to destiny. 
1248,"REMINGTON: We surely do, honey. We surely do. "
1249, [Warehouse] 
1250, (Ace takes out another Cyberman on the upper floor
1251,then leads another on a chase while the Doctor continues his
1252,"programming. Another meets its end on a small spiral stone staircase,"
1253,"but the second forces her to move up the steps, leaving the bag of"
1254,coins behind. 
1255,(The Nemesis lies down in the rocket sled.) 
1256,"DOCTOR: And now, we'll set the rockets for the correct projection, and"
1257,then you will be on course for the Cyberfleet. 
1258,(Ace makes her way along a catwalk up in the roof space. She sees the
1259,"Tardis down below her, then a Cyberman pops up in front of her and"
1260,holds up its hands. The Cyberleader is on the adjoining catwalk.) 
1261,ACE: Why? You're going to kill me anyway. 
1262,LEADER: We detect only one more piece of gold. 
1263,"ACE: Correct. So who'll be next, and who'll be lucky? "
1264,(A third Cyberman boxes her in from the rear.) 
1265,LEADER: Kill her. 
1266,"(Ace fires her catapult at the Cyberleader on the other catwalk, then"
1267,ducks to let the two Cybermen in front and behind kill each other. 
1268,The Doctor is outside the rocket sled.) 
1269,"DOCTOR: The rockets are now locked in to a destination. Now, let's see"
1270,how the Cyberfleet is progressing. 
1271,(He turns on the tape deck scanner.) 
1272,DOCTOR: Right on course. 
1273,NEMESIS: And I'm to destroy the entire Cyberfleet? 
1274,DOCTOR: Forever. 
1275,NEMESIS: And then? 
1276,DOCTOR: Reform. 
1277,"NEMESIS: You might need me in the future, then? "
1278,DOCTOR: I hope not. 
1279,NEMESIS: That is what you said before. 
1280,DOCTOR: Enough. 
1281,"NEMESIS: And after this, will I have my freedom? "
1282,DOCTOR: Not yet. 
1283,NEMESIS: When? 
1284,DOCTOR: I told you when. 
1285,(The Doctor takes the bow from Nemesis.) 
1286,DOCTOR: Things are still imperfect. 
1287,"(Two Cybermen approach the Doctor and Ace runs in. They turn, guns"
1288,raised.) 
1289,"DOCTOR: Stop! Harm her in the slightest, and I will destroy this bow! "
1290,"CYBERMAN: Give us the bow, Doctor. "
1291,DOCTOR: No. 
1292,CYBERMAN: We shall simply take it and kill you both. 
1293,DOCTOR: Ah. 
1294,"CYBERMAN: In any case, your threat was meaningless. How could you have"
1295,destroyed the bow? 
1296,"DOCTOR: Well, actually, I would have arranged to have the bow neatly"
1297,placed in front of the rocket sled. Then I would have arranged the
1298,"rockets to test fire at a pre-arranged time. By the way, Ace, what is"
1299,the time? 
1300,"ACE: Well, it's almost "
1301,(The Doctor hooks her arm with his umbrella and pulls back behind the
1302,"rocket motors just before they burst into life, incinerating the"
1303,"Cyberman. The Doctor covers Ace's eyes. Up on the catwalk, the Cyberman"
1304,removes the bent gold coin from its chest unit.) 
1305,"ACE: Is that it, Doctor? Oh no, not you again. "
1306,(It is De Flores and Karl.) 
1307,DE FLORES: The bow. 
1308,(Karl picks it up and hands it to De Flores.) 
1309,DE FLORES: We have both succeeded in deceiving the Cybermen. 
1310,"KARL: They made the mistake of assuming all human beings to be weak,"
1311,"corruptible. We, however, are loyal to the death. "
1312,(De Flores takes the bow to Nemesis.) 
1313,DE FLORES: The long journey is over. You will be worshipped forever.
1314,Doesn't she speak? 
1315,DOCTOR: Not to the likes of you. 
1316,"DE FLORES: She will. Well, Doctor, we must part. And thank you for"
1317,removing the Cybermen. Now the Nemesis is finally mine. 
1318,(The Cyberleader shoots De Flores and Karl.) 
1319,"ACE: I'm sorry, Doctor. I thought I'd got him. "
1320,"LEADER: Give me the bow, or I will kill her. "
1321,"PEINFORTE: All things, all power. Time, space, the world. "
1322,LEADER: She is mad. 
1323,RICHARD: Speak not of my lady so. 
1324,"PEINFORTE: See, I am here. "
1325,ACE: What do you want? 
1326,PEINFORTE: My Nemesis. 
1327,ACE: You're too late. The Doctor's got it. 
1328,PEINFORTE: It is incomplete until it holds the bow. That may be given
1329,over to anyone. It will now be given to me. 
1330,LEADER: No! To us. 
1331,"PEINFORTE: You are nothing. Only the Doctor matters, and he is but a"
1332,pawn in the game of my making. 
1333,"ACE: Listen, you old bag. "
1334,RICHARD: Silence! 
1335,"ACE: The Doctor's not just going to give you the bow. Tell her, Doctor."
1336,Tell her. 
1337,"PEINFORTE: Doctor who? Have you never wondered where he came from, who"
1338,he is? 
1339,ACE: Nobody knows who the Doctor is. 
1340,PEINFORTE: Except me. 
1341,ACE: How? 
1342,PEINFORTE: The statue told me. 
1343,"ACE: All right, so what does it matter? He's a Time Lord, I know that. "
1344,"PEINFORTE: Well, Doctor? "
1345,DOCTOR: If I give you the bow 
1346,"PEINFORTE: Your power becomes mine, but your secrets remain your own. "
1347,"DOCTOR: It's all over, Ace. My battle, all my battles, I've lost. I can"
1348,only surrender. 
1349,PEINFORTE: Yes. 
1350,DOCTOR: But not to you. The Cybermen will have the Nemesis. 
1351,(The Doctor gives the bow to the Cyberleader.) 
1352,"LEADER: This is most rational, Doctor. "
1353,PEINFORTE: But I know your secrets. 
1354,"DOCTOR: Very well, tell them. "
1355,"PEINFORTE: I shall tell them of Gallifrey, tell them of the old time,"
1356,the time of chaos. 
1357,DOCTOR: Be my guest. 
1358,PEINFORTE: Your secrets 
1359,LEADER: The secrets of the Time Lords mean nothing to us. 
1360,DOCTOR: Exactly. Thank you for coming to the twentieth century and
1361,giving me assistance. Thank you for bringing the arrow. You may go now.
1362,
1363,PEINFORTE: What? 
1364,"DOCTOR: You had the right game, but the wrong pawn. Check. "
1365,"LEADER: Enough, Doctor. Cancel the statue's destructive capability. "
1366,(The Doctor takes back the bow.) 
1367,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
1368,(And gives it back to Nemesis.) 
1369,DOCTOR: Do you understand the Cyberleader's instructions? 
1370,NEMESIS: Perfectly. 
1371,"ACE: Please don't surrender, Doctor. "
1372,LEADER: Prepare it for launching to liaise with our fleet. You have the
1373,position from this device. 
1374,(The Cyberleader holds up the tape.) 
1375,"LEADER: A new and final era begins, Doctor. Imagination, thought,"
1376,"freedom, pleasure, all will end. "
1377,(It crushes the jazz tape and throws it away.) 
1378,"LEADER: The Earth will be transformed into our base planet, the new"
1379,"Mondas. Before I kill you all, you may watch the arrival of our fleet."
1380,Launch the Nemesis. 
1381,"ACE: Let them kill me, Doctor. Don't surrender. "
1382,DOCTOR: Stand back. She's ready for launching. 
1383,"(Lady Peinforte screams, grabs the bow and throws herself on top of the"
1384,"Nemesis. It writhes as it absorbs her, then the rocket sled blasts out"
1385,of the warehouse entrance and up into the sky. Mrs Remington watches it
1386,go.) 
1387,"ACE: Nice rocket technology, Doctor. "
1388,LEADER: We will watch its progress. 
1389,DOCTOR: Certainly. 
1390,(The Doctor turns on the tape deck scanner. The Nemesis flies into the
1391,"heart of the Cyberfleet, which is stationed by the moon, and detonates.) "
1392,LEADER: This is impossible. You gave my instructions to the statue. 
1393,"DOCTOR: Yes, I gave your instructions to the Nemesis, and it understood"
1394,"them. It understood them, and disobeyed them, and destroyed the"
1395,Cyberfleet. 
1396,LEADER: Then you will join them. 
1397,DOCTOR: It's worth it. 
1398,(Richard sees his gold tipped arrow still stuck in the Tardis' door. He
1399,"grabs it, runs over and thrusts it into the Cyberleader's chest. It"
1400,dies with a lot of noise.) 
1401,DOCTOR: That seems to be that. Thank you. 
1402,"RICHARD: It was nothing, Doctor. I wish I could have saved my lady,"
1403,"too, but she was one with your statue. How shall I live now, stranded,"
1404,a stranger in this time? 
1405,DOCTOR: I know how you feel. However 
1406,ACE: He'll give you a lift. 
1407,DOCTOR: Back to 1638? 
1408,RICHARD: It's possible? 
1409,DOCTOR: Anything's possible. 
1410, [Lady Peinforte's home] 
1411, (The Doctor and Ace are playing chess in the
1412,garden.) 
1413,ACE: So you sent the Nemesis off into space to draw the Cybermen so you
1414,could finish them off. 
1415,DOCTOR: I suppose I did. How clever of me. 
1416,ACE: Just like you nailed the Daleks. 
1417,"DOCTOR: As I said, Ace. Unfinished business. "
1418,(The Doctor tips over his king.) 
1419,ACE: There's still one question you haven't answered. 
1420,(Richard and a lady lute player approach.) 
1421,"RICHARD: We have none of this jazz whereof you speak, Doctor, but I"
1422,think you will like this. 
1423,(Richard plays the flute while his companion plays the lute.) 
1424,ACE: Professor? Doctor? Who are you? 
1425,(The Doctor puts his finger to his lips.)
