19, ELDANE
20,": This is the story of our planet, Earth. Of the day a thousand"
21,years past when we came to share it with a race know as Humanity. It is
22,"the story of the Doctor, who helped our races find common ground, and"
23,the terrible losses he suffered. It is the story of our past and must
24,never be forgotten.
25,
26,[City]
27,
28,DOCTOR: This place is enormous and deserted. The
29,majority of the race are probably still asleep. We need to find Amy.
30,Looking for heat signature anomalies. 
31,"NASREEN: But Doctor, how can all this be here? I mean, these plants. "
32,DOCTOR: Must be getting closer to the centre of the city. 
33,NASREEN: You're sure this is the best way to enter? 
34,DOCTOR: Front door approach. Definitely. Always the best way. 
35,(Alarms sound.) 
36,COMPUTER: Hostile life forms detected area seventeen. 
37,DOCTOR: Apart from the back door approach. That's also good. Sometimes
38,better. 
39,COMPUTER: Hostile life forms detected area seventeen. 
40,NASREEN: Doctor. 
41,(Warriors approach from both sides.) 
42,COMPUTER: Hostile life forms detected area seventeen. 
43,DOCTOR: We're not hostile. We're not armed. We're here in peace. 
44,(A warrior steps forward and gasses them with its weapon.)
45,
46,[Laboratory]
47,
48,AMY: Don't you come near me with that. 
49,(The scientist makes an audio note.) 
50,"MALOHKEH: From the clothing, the human female appears to be more"
51,resistant to the cold than the male. 
52,AMY: I dressed for Rio! 
53,MO: Leave her alone. You've got me. 
54,(Amy's wrists are clamped tighter.) 
55,AMY: Argh. 
56,MALOHKEH: Decontamination complete. Commencing dissection. 
57,TANNOY: Area Seventeen incursion. Species diagnostic requested. Area
58,Seventeen incursion. Species diagnostic requested. 
59,(Malohkeh runs out.) 
60,AMY: Yeah. And stay out. 
61,(Amy has somehow managed to get the restraints control from Malohkeh.
62,"She frees herself, then Mo.) "
63,AMY: Ah ah! 
64,MO; How did you get that? 
65,"AMY: You never picked a lizard man's pocket? Come on, before he gets"
66,back.
67,
68,[Tunnel]
69,
70,"MO: That creature, do you think it was an alien?"
71,"Any more of them, do you think? Do you think the Earth's been invaded? "
72,AMY: Don't know. But I know someone who could have some answers. We
73,need to get back to the surface and find him. I wonder where this
74,leads. 
75,MO: Maybe it's a way out of here. 
76,"(Amy presses a button on a wall panel. A screen lights up, then the"
77,"area behind the door. It is a stasis alcove, and Elliot is inside.) "
78,"MO: Oh, my God, no. "
79,AMY: What is it? 
80,MO: It's my son. It's Elliot. What've they done to him? He's in there.
81,"We have to get him out. Elliot? Elliot, it's Dad. "
82,COMPUTER: Access denied. Unauthorised genetic imprint. 
83,"AMY: Stop. Seriously, we can't get in. "
84,MO: That's my boy in there. 
85,"AMY: These screens, they're monitoring something. I think they're vital"
86,"signs. Heartbeats, pulses. Why else would he be wired up? He's still"
87,alive. 
88,"MO: All right. We find weapons, get that creature from the lab and"
89,"force it to release Elliot, yeah? "
90,AMY: Yeah. Trust me. We'll get him out.
91,
92,[Graveyard]
93,
94,(Ambrose is still holding Elliot's headphones.) 
95,RORY: Ambrose. 
96,AMBROSE: You lied. You told us you were the police. 
97,RORY: It was a misunderstanding. 
98,AMBROSE: Who are you? You and the Doctor? Why is this happening to us?
99,What did we ever do? 
100,"RORY: The Doctor'll get your son back, I promise. In the meantime, we"
101,take turns guarding the creature. 
102,"AMBROSE: Oh, so that's it? We just sit and wait. "
103,"RORY: And then we exchange her for your family. I promise you, Ambrose,"
104,I trust the Doctor with my life. We stick to his plan. We keep that
105,creature safe. 
106,[Laboratory]
107,
108,"(The Doctor is being scanned, and it hurts.) "
109,DOCTOR: Argh. 
110,RESTAC: How can they have escaped? This proves all prisoners should
111,remain under military guard. 
112,MALOHKEH: I'm sure you'd prefer to be in charge of everything and
113,"everyone, Restac, but we rank the same. Is there any word from Alaya? "
114,RESTAC: No. 
115,"MALOHKEH: It's fine to show concern, you know. She's part of your"
116,gene-chain. I'm decontaminating now. 
117,"DOCTOR: Decontamination? No, no, no. "
118,(That hurts even more.)
119,
120,[Crypt]
121,
122,(Alaya is soaking in the sunlight from the small
123,window when she smells Mack enter.) 
124,ALAYA: Why aren't you dead? You're carrying my venom in your blood. But
125,you should have died. Why aren't you dead? Show me. 
126,(Mack shows her the green veins.) 
127,"ALAYA: How does it feel, ape? "
128,"MACK: Like it's burning in my blood. Please, if you help me, I can help"
129,"you. If you could cure me, I could help you escape. "
130,ALAYA: You see? You beg and offer betrayal so early. Why would I want
131,to escape when I can watch you die? The first ape death of the coming
132,war.
133,
134,[Laboratory]
135,
136,DOCTOR: No! Argh! 
137,"MALOHKEH: It's all right, it won't harm you. I'm only neutralising all"
138,your ape bacteria. 
139,DOCTOR: I'm not an ape. Look at the scans. Two hearts. Totally
140,"different. Totally not ape! Remove all human germs, you remove half the"
141,things keeping me alive. 
142,(Malohkeh turns off the decontamination machine.) 
143,"RESTAC: No, complete the process. "
144,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's much better, thanks. Not got any celery, have you?"
145,"No. No, not really the climate. Tomatoes, though. You'd do a roaring"
146,"trade in those. I'm the Doctor. Oh, and there's Nasreen. Good. "
147,(Nasreen wakes.) 
148,"NASREEN: Oh, a green man. "
149,DOCTOR: Hello. Who are you? 
150,"RESTAC: Restac, Military commander. "
151,"DOCTOR: Oh dear, really? There's always a military, isn't there? "
152,MALOHKEH: Your weapon was attacking the oxygen pockets above our city. 
153,"DOCTOR: Oxygen pockets, lovely. Ooo, but not so good with an impending"
154,drill. Now it makes sense. 
155,RESTAC: Where is the rest of your invasion force? 
156,DOCTOR: Invasion force. Me and lovely Nasreen? No. We came for the
157,"humans you took. And to offer the safe return of Alaya. Oh wait, you"
158,"and she, what is it, same genetic source? Of course you're worried, but"
159,"don't be, she's safe. "
160,"RESTAC: You claim to come in peace, but you hold one of us hostage. "
161,"DOCTOR: Wait, wait, we all want the same thing here. "
162,RESTAC: I don't negotiate with apes. I'm going to send a clear message
163,to those on the surface. 
164,DOCTOR: What's that? 
165,RESTAC: Your execution. 
166,DOCTOR: Yes.
167,
168,[Cryo-chambers]
169,
170,AMY: These chambers are all over the city. 
171,(She lights up two. They contain Silurians.) 
172,"MO: Urgh. Turn it off, quick. They're not moving. "
173,AMY: Maybe they're asleep. Let's have another look. 
174,"MO: No, Amy, don't. Don't. "
175,(Amy opens the chamber and goes inside.) 
176,"MO: Amy, what are you doing? Get out of there. "
177,AMY: Some sort of suspended animation. I wonder what these are? 
178,(The discs the Silurians are standing on.) 
179,AMY: The Doctor would know. The Doctor always knows. 
180,"MO: Hey, look. "
181,(Above the two Silurians are tunnels heading straight up.) 
182,AMY: Wait. I've got it. It's how they came up to the surface. Some sort
183,of powered transport discs. It's our way out of here. 
184,"MO: Even better. Weapons. Come on, now we can fight back. "
185,(They take the Silurian disc weapons from the warriors and back out of
186,the chamber. Amy switches it off.) 
187,MO: Which way now? 
188,AMY: Door at the end. 
189,MO: Are you sure? 
190,AMY: No.
191,
192,[Army storage]
193,
194,(The door at the end leads to a balcony overlooking
195,"a vast chamber, containing warriors as far as the eye can see.) "
196,MO: Wow. 
197,AMY: Yeah. 
198,MO: We don't stand a chance. 
199,AMY: We have to find the Doctor.
200,
201,[Church]
202,
203,(Mack raids the first aid box for pain killers.) 
204,"AMBROSE: Dad, are you all right? Dad? "
205,"MACK: Ambrose, I'm fine. Leave me alone. "
206,"AMBROSE: You are not fine. Let me, let me look. "
207,MACK: Get off. 
208,"AMBROSE: Let me look. Oh, my God, Dad. "
209,MACK: I don't know what's happening to me. 
210,"AMBROSE: It's going to be fine. First thing is, bring this temperature"
211,down. Get you resting.
212,
213,[Gardens]
214,
215,(The Doctor and Nasreen are under escort.) 
216,DOCTOR: These must be the only ones awake. The others must still be in
217,hibernation. 
218,"NASREEN: So, why did they go into hibernation in the first place? "
219,DOCTOR: Their astronomers predicted the planet heading to Earth on a
220,crash course. They a built life underground and put themselves to sleep
221,"for millennia in order to avert what they thought was the apocalypse,"
222,when in reality it was the moon coming into alignment with the Earth. 
223,MALOHKEH: How can you know that? 
224,"DOCTOR: Long time ago, I met another tribe of Homo Reptilia. Similar,"
225,but not identical. 
226,RESTAC: Others of our species have survived? 
227,DOCTOR: The humans attacked them. They died. I'm sorry. 
228,(Doctor Who and The
229,Silurians) 
230,RESTAC: A vermin race.
231,
232,[Crypt]
233,
234,AMBROSE: What's the cure? 
235,ALAYA: What? 
236,AMBROSE: I saw what you've done to my dad. What's the cure? 
237,ALAYA: Why would I tell you? 
238,"AMBROSE: Because if you don't, I'm going to have to use this on you. "
239,(Ambrose has kept a taser from her collection of weapons.) 
240,ALAYA: Now you reveal yourselves. 
241,"AMBROSE: First you take my son, now you hurt my dad. I'm just"
242,"protecting my family here, that's all. I don't want to use it. I want"
243,you to put things right. 
244,ALAYA: Use it. 
245,AMBROSE: What? 
246,ALAYA: Use it on me. But you're too afraid. A woman who can't even
247,protect her own child must be too weak to 
248,(Ambrose zaps Alaya. She falls to her knees.) 
249,"AMBROSE: I didn't want to do that. Are you all right? Tell me, what's"
250,the cure for my dad? 
251,ALAYA: He's vermin. He deserves a painful death. 
252,AMBROSE: I am giving you a chance. 
253,ALAYA: I knew it would be you. The one with the most to lose. The
254,weakest. 
255,(Ambrose uses the taser again.)
256,
257,[Church]
258,
259,RORY: I'm a nurse. You should have told me. 
260,(They hear a scream from the crypt.)
261,
262,[Crypt]
263,
264,(Alaya is still alive. Rory runs to her.) 
265,"MACK: Ambrose, what have you done? "
266,AMBROSE: She kept taunting me about Mo and Elliot and you. 
267,MACK: We have to be better than this. 
268,AMBROSE: She wouldn't tell me anything. I thought sooner or later she'd
269,"give in. I would have done. I just, I just want my family back, Dad. "
270,RORY: I'm sorry. How do we help you? Tell us what to do. 
271,ALAYA: I knew this would come. And soon the war. 
272,RORY: You're not dying. I'm not going to let you. Not today. 
273,(Alaya dies.) 
274,[Court]
275,
276,"(Long table in the middle, ranks of benches along"
277,the walls.) 
278,MALOHKEH: You're not authorised to do this. 
279,RESTAC: I am authorised to protect the safety of our species while they
280,sleep. 
281,"DOCTOR: Oh, lovely place. Very gleaming. "
282,RESTAC: This is our court and our place of execution. 
283,AMY: Let them go. 
284,DOCTOR: Amy Pond. There's a girl to rely on. 
285,"AMY: You're covered both ways, so don't try anything clever, buster. "
286,NASREEN: Mo. 
287,"AMY: Now let them go, or I shoot. "
288,(Restac moves towards Amy.) 
289,AMY: I'm warning you. 
290,(Restac disarms Amy.) 
291,DOCTOR: Don't you touch her! 
292,RESTAC: And you. 
293,(Mo is disarmed.) 
294,"MALOHKEH: All right, Restac, you've made your point. "
295,"RESTAC: This is now a military tribunal. Go back to your laboratory,"
296,Malohkeh. 
297,(They hiss at each other.) 
298,MALOHKEH: This isn't the way. 
299,RESTAC: Prepare them for execution. 
300,"AMY: Okay, sorry. As rescues go, didn't live up to its potential. "
301,(The four are shacked to rings in a pair of columns.) 
302,DOCTOR: I'm glad you're okay. 
303,"AMY: Me too. Lizard men, though. "
304,DOCTOR: Homo Reptilia. They occupied the planet before humans. Now they
305,want it back. 
306,NASREEN: After they've wiped out the human race. 
307,"AMY: Right. Preferred it when I didn't know, to be honest. "
308,NASREEN: Why are they waiting? What do you think they're going to do
309,with us? 
310,[Crypt]
311,
312,"AMBROSE: I didn't know it would go like that, Dad. "
313,"MACK: My little girl, what have you done? "
314,AMBROSE: What happens now? 
315,(A computer screen in a box comes to life.) 
316,"AMBROSE: Oh, my God. "
317,RESTAC [on screen]: Who is the ape leader? 
318,AMBROSE: It's them. How are they doing that? How do they know that
319,we're in here? 
320,(Ambrose covers Alaya's body with a tarpaulin.) 
321,RESTAC [on screen]: Who speaks for the apes? 
322,MACK: Don't tell them what's happened.
323,
324,[Court]
325,
326,(Rory is on a large holographic screen.) 
327,"RORY [on screen]: I speak for the humans. Some of us, anyway. "
328,[Crypt]
329,
330,RESTAC [on screen]: Do you understand who we are? 
331,RORY: Sort of. A bit. Not really. 
332,RESTAC [on screen]: We have ape hostages. 
333,[Court]
334,
335,RORY [on screen]: Doctor! Amy! 
336,"AMBROSE [on screen]: Mo! Mo, are you okay?"
337,
338,[Crypt]
339,
340,"MO [on screen]: I'm fine, love. I've found Elliot."
341,I'm bringing him home. 
342,"RORY: Amy, I thought I'd lost you. "
343,"AMY [on screen]: What, cause I was sucked into the ground? You're so"
344,clingy. 
345,NASREEN [on screen]: Tony Mack!
346,
347,[Crypt]
348,
349,MACK: Having fun down there? 
350,"DOCTOR [on screen]: Not to interrupt, but just a quick reminder to stay"
351,calm. 
352,"RESTAC [on screen]: Show me Alaya. Show me, and release her immediately"
353,"unharmed, or we kill your friends "
354,[Court]
355,
356,RESTAC: One by one. 
357,AMBROSE [on screen]: No.

361,"DOCTOR [on screen]: Steady now, everyone."
362,

364,
365,"MACK [on screen]: Ambrose, stop it. "
366,"AMBROSE [on screen]: Get off me, Dad. "
367,[Crypt]
368,
369,AMBROSE: We didn't start this.

372,
373,"DOCTOR: Let Rory deal with this, Ambrose, eh?"
374,
375,[Crypt]
376,
377,AMBROSE: We are not doing what you say any more.
378,"Now, give me back my family. "
379,RESTAC [on screen]: No. Execute the girl. 
380,"RORY: No! No, wait! "
381,AMY [on screen]: Rory!
382,
383,[Court]
384,
385,RORY [on screen]: She's not speaking for us. 
386,DOCTOR: There's no need for this. 
387,"RORY [on screen]: Listen, listen. Whatever you want, we'll do it. "

398,
399,RESTAC: Fire! 
400,"ELDANE: Stop! You want to start a war while the rest of us sleep,"
401,Restac? 
402,RESTAC: The apes are attacking us. 
403,"ELDANE: You're our protector, not our commander, Restac. Unchain them. "
404,"RESTAC: I do not recognise your authority at this time, Eldane. "
405,"ELDANE: Well then, you must shoot me. "
406,RESTAC: You woke him to undermine me. 
407,MALOHKEH: We're not monsters. And neither are they. 
408,"RESTAC: What is it about apes you love so much, hmm? "
409,"MALOHKEH: While you slept, they've evolved. I've seen it for myself. "
410,"RESTAC: We used to hunt apes for sport. When we came underground, they"
411,bred and polluted this planet. 
412,"ELDANE: Shush now, Restac. Go and play soldiers. I'll let you know if I"
413,need you. 
414,"RESTAC: You'll need me, then we'll see."
415,
416,[Crypt]
417,
418,RORY: Nothing. I've got to get down there. 
419,DOCTOR [on screen]: Rory. Hello. 
420,RORY: Where's Amy? 
421,"DOCTOR [on screen]: She's fine. Look, here, she is. "
422,"RORY: Oh, thank God. "
423,AMY [on screen]: Keeping you on your toes. 
424,"DOCTOR [on screen]: No time to chat. Listen, you need to get down here."
425,Go to the drill storeroom. There's a large patch of earth in the middle
426,of the floor. The Silurians are going to send up transport discs to
427,bring you back down using geothermal energy and gravity bubble
428,"technology. It's how they travel and frankly, it's pretty cool. Bring"
429,"Alaya. We hand her over, we can land this after all. All going to work,"
430,promise. Got to dash. Hurry up. 
431,(Transmission ends.) 
432,"MACK: The moment we get down there, everything will fall apart. "
433,RORY: We have to return her. They deserve at least that.
434,
435,[Court]
436,
437,DOCTOR: I'd say you've got a fair bit to talk
438,about. 
439,ELDANE: How so? 
440,DOCTOR: You both want the planet. You both have a genuine claim to it. 
441,ELDANE: Are you authorised to negotiate on behalf of humanity? 
442,DOCTOR: Me? No. But they are. 
443,NASREEN: What? 
444,"AMY: No, we're not. "
445,"DOCTOR: Course you are. Amy Pond and Nasreen Chaudhry, speaking for the"
446,"planet? Humanity couldn't have better ambassadors. Come on, who has"
447,more fun than us? 
448,"AMY: Is this what happens, in the future? The planet gets shared? Is"
449,that what we need to do? 
450,"NASREEN: Er, what are you talking about? "
451,"DOCTOR: Oh Nasreen, sorry. Probably worth mentioning at this stage, Amy"
452,and I travel in time a bit. 
453,NASREEN: Anything else? 
454,DOCTOR: There are fixed points through time where things must always
455,stay the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity.
456,"A temporal tipping point. Whatever happens today, will change future"
457,"events, create its own timeline, its own reality. The future pivots"
458,"around you, here, now. So do good, for humanity, and for Earth. "
459,"AMY: Right. No pressure there, then. "
460,NASREEN: We can't share the planet. Nobody on the surface is going to
461,go for this idea. It is just too big a leap. 
462,DOCTOR: Come on. Be extraordinary. 
463,NASREEN: Oh. 
464,DOCTOR: Okay. Bringing things to order. The first meeting of
465,representatives of the human race and Homo Reptilia is now in session.
466,"Ha! Never said that before. That's fab. Carry on. Now, Mo. Let's go and"
467,"get your son. Oh, you know, humans, and their predecessors shooting the"
468,breeze. Never thought I'd see it.

470,
471,(Four travel discs are lined up.) 
472,"MACK: So we get on those, and they take us down through the Earth? "
473,"RORY: Geothermal gravity bubbles, or something. "
474,AMBROSE: They sent four. She was our only bargaining chip. 
475,RORY: We have to hand her back. 
476,"AMBROSE: Wait. Before we go down, there's something I've got to do."
477,Dad? I need your help.
478,
479,[Tunnel]
480,
481,MACK: No. No way. 
482,"AMBROSE: Please, Dad. Just a precaution. "
483,"MACK: I told you, I won't do it. "
484,AMBROSE: Look at what they did to you. 
485,MACK: This isn't about me or you. 
486,"AMBROSE: No, it's about your grandson. If you won't do it for me, do it"
487,"for Elliot. I know I did wrong, but I can't lose him, Dad."

492,MO: If you've harmed him in any way. 
493,MALOHKEH: Of course not. I only store the young. 
494,DOCTOR: But why? 
495,"MALOHKEH: I took samples of the young, slowed their lifecycles to a"
496,"millionth of their normal rate so I could study how they grew, what"
497,"they needed, how they lived on the surface. "
498,"DOCTOR: You've been down here working by yourself, all alone? "
499,"MALOHKEH: My family, through the millennia, and for the last three"
500,"hundred years, just me. I never meant to harm your child. "
501,"DOCTOR: Malohkeh, I rather love you. "
502,MALOHKEH: It's safe. We can wake him. 
503,(Malohkeh unhooks Elliot from the wires.) 
504,MALOHKEH: Come. 
505,"MO: Elliot? Ell, it's Dad. "
506,ELLIOT: Dad. 
507,MO: You're safe now. 
508,ELLIOT: Where are we? 
509,"MO: Well, I've got to be honest with you, son. We're in the centre of"
510,"the Earth, and there are lizard men. "
511,MALOHKEH: Hi. 
512,ELLIOT: Wow. 
513,DOCTOR: Elliot. I'm sorry. I took my eye off you. 
514,ELLIOT: It's okay. I forgive you. 
515,"MALOHKEH: You go on, Doctor. I'll catch up. "
516,COMPUTER: Storage facility nineteen operational. 
517,[Court]
518,
519,ELDANE: We lived on the surface of the planet long
520,before you did. Our sole purpose has been to return to our rightful
521,place. 
522,NASREEN: And we've got a planet that can't already sustain the people
523,who live there. And you want to add a whole other species to drain
524,resources 
525,"ELDANE : As I sat there that day across the table from the humans,"
526,the future of both species and of our beloved planet Earth rested in
527,"our hands. But as the discussions went on, I began to despair about"
528,whether we would ever find any common ground. As ambassadors for our
529,species we all had too much to lose. 
530,"AMY: So, what about the areas that aren't habitable to us? Australian"
531,"outback, Sahara desert, Nevada plains. They're all deserted. "
532,"NASREEN: Yes, fine, but what happens when their population grows and"
533,"breeds and spreads? And anyway, what benefit does humanity get, and how"
534,will we ever sell this to people on the surface? 
535,"ELDANE: If I could get a word in, maybe I could tell you. You give us"
536,"space, we can bring new sources of energy, new methods of water supply,"
537,"new medicines, scientific advances. We were a great civilisation. You"
538,"provide a place for us on the surface, we'll give you knowledge and"
539,"technology beyond humanity's dreams. If we work together, this planet"
540,could achieve greatness. 
541,NASREEN: Okay. Now I'm starting to see it. 
542,AMY: Oh yeah. 
543,(The Doctor enters with Mo and Elliot.) 
544,DOCTOR: Not bad for a first session. More similarities than
545,differences. 
546,ELDANE: The transport has returned. Your friends are here.
547,
548,[Cryo-chambers]
549,
550,MALOHKEH: That's not right. What are you doing? 
551,(The warriors are being revived.) 
552,RESTAC: Protecting our race against the apes. 
553,MALOHKEH: You can't do this. 
554,"RESTAC: You're a good scientist, Malohkeh, but this is war. "
555,(Restac kills Malohkeh.)

559,"(Rory appears in the doorway, followed by Ambrose,"
560,then Mack carrying Alaya's
561,body wrapped in a blanket.) 
562,DOCTOR: Here they are. 
563,ELLIOT: Mum! 
564,AMY: Rory! 
565,DOCTOR: Something's wrong. 
566,"AMY: Doctor, what's he carrying? "
567,DOCTOR: No. Don't do this. Tell me you didn't do this. 
568,(Mack lays Alaya on the floor.) 
569,DOCTOR: What did you do? 
570,AMBROSE: It was me. I did it. 
571,ELLIOT: Mum? 
572,AMBROSE: I just wanted you back. 
573,"DOCTOR: I'm sorry. I didn't know. You have to believe me, they're"
574,better than this. 
575,AMBROSE: This is our planet! 
576,DOCTOR: We had a chance here. 
577,AMBROSE: Leave us alone. 
578,"DOCTOR: In future, when you talk about this, you tell people there was"
579,a chance but you were so much less than the best of humanity. 
580,(Restac and her troops march in.) 
581,"RESTAC: My sister. Oh. And you want us to trust these apes, Doctor? "
582,DOCTOR: One woman. She was scared for her family. She is not typical. 
583,RESTAC: I think she is. 
584,"DOCTOR: One person let us down, but there is a whole race of dazzling,"
585,peaceful human beings up there. You were building something here. Come
586,on. An alliance could work. 
587,"AMBROSE: It's too late for that, Doctor. "
588,DOCTOR: Why? 
589,AMBROSE: Our drill is set to start burrowing again in fifteen minutes. 
590,NASREEN: What? 
591,MACK: What choice did I have? They had Elliot. 
592,DOCTOR: Don't do this. Don't call their bluff. 
593,AMBROSE: Let us go back. And you promise to never come to the surface
594,"ever again. We'll walk away, leave you alone. "
595,RESTAC: Execute her. 
596,DOCTOR: No! 
597,(The Doctor grabs Ambrose and they run.) 
598,"DOCTOR: Everybody, back to the lab. Run. "
599,RESTAC: Execute all the apes. 
600,(The Doctor gets out his sonic screwdriver. The Silurian weapons go
601,Bang!) 
602,DOCTOR: This is a deadly weapon. Stay back. 
603,(He dodges a lashing tongue.)
604,
605,[Tunnel]
606,
607,DOCTOR: Take everyone to the lab. I'll cover you. 
608,RORY: Go. Go. 
609,"DOCTOR: Ah, ah, Stop right there or I'll use my very deadly weapon"
610,"again. One warning, that's all you get. If there can be no deal, you go"
611,"back into hibernation. All of you, now. This ends here. "
612,RESTAC: No. It only ends with our victory. 
613,"DOCTOR: Like I said, one warning. "
614,[Laboratory]
615,
616,(The Doctor seals the door.) 
617,"DOCTOR: Elliot, you and your dad keep your eyes on that screen. Let me"
618,"know if we get company. Amy, keep reminding me how much time I haven't"
619,got. 
620,"AMY: Okay. Um, er, twelve minutes till drill impact. "
621,"DOCTOR: Tony Mack. Sweaty forehead, dilated pupils. What are you"
622,hiding? 
623,(The green veins are all across his chest.) 
624,"NASREEN: Tony, what happened? "
625,"MACK: Alaya's sting. She said there's no cure. I'm dying, aren't I? "
626,"DOCTOR: You're not dying, you're mutating. "
627,MACK: How can I stop it? 
628,"DOCTOR: Decontamination program. Might work. Don't know. Eldane, can"
629,you run the program on Tony? 
630,"MO: Doctor, shedload of those creatures coming our way. We're"
631,surrounded in here. 
632,"DOCTOR: So, question is, how we do stop the drill given we can't get"
633,"there in time? Plus, also, how do we get out, given that we're"
634,"surrounded? Nasreen, how do you feel about an energy pulse channelled"
635,up through the tunnels to the base of the drill? 
636,NASREEN: To blow up my life's work? 
637,DOCTOR: Yes. Sorry. No nice way of putting that. 
638,"NASREEN: Right, well, you're going to have to do it before the drill"
639,"hits the city, in er "
640,AMY: Eleven minutes forty seconds. 
641,DOCTOR: Yes. Squeaky bum time. 
642,"NASREEN: Yes, but the explosion is going to cave in all the surrounding"
643,"tunnels, so we have to be out and on the surface by then. "
644,RORY: But we can't get past Restac's troops. 
645,ELDANE: I can help with that. Toxic Fumigation. An emergency failsafe
646,meant to protect my species from infection. A warning signal to occupy
647,"cryo-chambers. After that, citywide fumigation by toxic gas. Then the"
648,city shuts down. 
649,AMY: You could end up killing your own people. 
650,ELDANE: Only those foolish enough to follow Restac. 
651,"DOCTOR: Eldane, are you sure about this? "
652,ELDANE: My priority is my race's survival. The Earth isn't ready for us
653,to return yet. 
654,DOCTOR: No. 
655,"AMY: Ten minutes, Doctor. "
656,"DOCTOR: But maybe it should be. So, here's a deal. Everybody listening."
657,"Eldane, you activate shutdown. I'll amend the system, set your alarm"
658,for a thousand years time. A thousand years to sort the planet out. To
659,"be ready. Pass it on. As legend, or prophesy, or religion, but somehow"
660,make it known. This planet is to be shared. 
661,ELLIOT: Yeah. I get you. 
662,"AMY: Nine minutes, seven seconds. "
663,"DOCTOR: Yes. Fluid controls, my favourite. Energy pulse. Timed, primed"
664,"and set. Before we go, energy barricade. Need to cancel it out quickly."
665,
666,ELDANE: Fumigation pre-launching. 
667,"RORY: There's not much time for us to get from here to the surface,"
668,Doctor. 
669,"DOCTOR: Ah ha, super-squeaky bum time. Get ready to run for your lives."
670,Now. 
671,ELDANE: But the decontamination program on your friend hasn't started
672,yet. 
673,"MACK: Well, go. All of you, go. "
674,"AMBROSE: No, we're not leaving you here. "
675,ELLIOT: Granddad. 
676,AMY: Eight minutes ten seconds. 
677,MACK: Now you look after your mum. You mustn't blame her. She only did
678,what she thought was right. 
679,"ELLIOT: I'm not going to see you again, am I? "
680,"MACK: I'll be here, always. I love you, boy. You be sure he gets home"
681,safe. 
682,AMBROSE: This is my fault. 
683,"MACK: No, I can't go back up there. I'd be a freak show. The technology"
684,down here's my only hope. 
685,"AMBROSE: I love you, Dad. "
686,MACK: Go. Go. 
687,MO: Come on. 
688,MACK: Go on. 
689,COMPUTER: Toxic fumigation initiated. 
690,[Tunnel]
691,
692,COMPUTER: Return to cryo-chambers. 
693,RESTAC: No. 
694,COMPUTER: Toxic fumigation initiated. 
695,RESTAC: No! 
696,COMPUTER: Return to cryo-chambers. 
697,RESTAC: This is not the order.

702,AMY: They're going. We're clear. 
703,"DOCTOR: Okay, everyone follow Nasreen. Look for a blue box. Get ready"
704,to run. 
705,COMPUTER: Return to cryo-chambers. 
706,DOCTOR: I'm sorry. 
707,"ELDANE: I thought for a moment, our race and the humans "
708,"DOCTOR: Yeah, me too. "
709,"AMY: Doctor, We've got less than six minutes. "
710,DOCTOR: Go. Go! I'm right behind you. Let's go. 
711,NASREEN: I'm not coming either. 
712,DOCTOR: What? 
713,[Tunnel]
714,
715,(Amy goes back for the Doctor.) 
716,"AMY: Oh, for goodness sake. "
717,[Laboratory]
718,
719,"NASREEN: We're going to hibernate with them, me and"
720,Tony. 
721,"ELDANE: Doctor, you must go. "
722,MACK: I can be decontaminated when we're woken. All the time in the
723,world. 
724,"DOCTOR: But, Nasreen, you "
725,"NASREEN: No, this is perfect. I don't want to go. I've got what I was"
726,digging for. I can't leave when I've only just found it. 
727,AMY: Doctor! 
728,"NASREEN: Thank you, Doctor. "
729,DOCTOR: The pleasure was all mine. 
730,NASREEN: Come and look for us. 
731,"ELDANE : So the Doctor sent our warriors back to their rest, on the"
732,promise of future harmony with humans. 
733,[City]
734,
735,COMPUTER: Immediate evacuation. 
736,(Rory passes them.) 
737,"AMY: Other way, idiot. "
738,COMPUTER: Toxic fumigation is about to commence. Immediate evacuation. 
739,DOCTOR: Come on. 
740,COMPUTER: Toxic fumigation is about to commence.
741,
742,[Outside the Tardis]
743,
744,"DOCTOR: No questions, just get in. And yes, I know,"
745,"it's big. Ambrose, sickbay up the stairs, left, then left again, Get"
746,yourself fixed up. Come on. Five minutes and counting. Not here. 
747,(There is a crack in the wall.) 
748,DOCTOR: Not now. It's getting wider. 
749,AMY: The crack on my bedroom wall. 
750,DOCTOR [memory]: Two parts of space and time that should never have
751,"touched, right here. "
752,"DOCTOR: And the Byzantium. All through the universe, rips in the"
753,continuum. 
754,AMY [memory]: How can it be following me? 
755,"DOCTOR: Some sort of space-time cataclysm. An explosion, maybe. Big"
756,enough to put cracks in the universe. But what? 
757,AMY: Four minutes fifty. We have to go. 
758,DOCTOR: The Angels laughed when I didn't know. Prisoner Zero knew.
759,Everybody knows except me. 
760,"AMY: Doctor, just leave it. "
761,"DOCTOR: But where there's an explosion, there's shrapnel. "
762,"RORY: Doctor, you can't put your hand in there. "
763,(The Doctor puts a red handkerchief over his hand and reaches into the
764,crack.) 
765,DOCTOR: Why not? 
766,(Because it hurts?) 
767,DOCTOR: Argh. I've got something. 
768,AMY: What is it? 
769,(He pulls his arm back out.) 
770,DOCTOR: I don't know. 
771,RORY: Doctor? 
772,(Restac crawls in.) 
773,AMY: She was there when the gas started. She must have been poisoned. 
774,RESTAC: You. 
775,"DOCTOR: Okay, get in the Tardis, both of you. "
776,RESTAC: You did this. 
777,(Restac raises her weapon.) 
778,RORY: Doctor! 
779,(Rory pushes the Doctor out of the way and takes the full force of the
780,blast.) 
781,AMY: Rory! 
782,"DOCTOR: Rory, can you hear me? "
783,RORY: I don't understand. 
784,"AMY: Shush. Don't talk. Doctor, is he okay? We have to get him onto the"
785,Tardis. 
786,RORY: We were on the hill. I can't die here. 
787,AMY: Don't say that. 
788,RORY: You're so beautiful. I'm sorry. 
789,(Rory dies.) 
790,"AMY: Doctor, help him. "
791,(Light from the crack reaches Rory's feet.) 
792,"DOCTOR [memory]: If the time energy catches up with you, you'll never"
793,have been born. It will erase every moment of your existence. You will
794,never have lived at all. At all. At all. At all. 
795,"DOCTOR: Amy, move away from the light. If it touches you, you'll be"
796,"wiped from history. Amy, move away now. "
797,AMY: No. I am not leaving him. We have to help him. 
798,DOCTOR: The light's already around him. We can't help him. 
799,AMY: I am not leaving him. 
800,DOCTOR: We have to. 
801,AMY: No! 
802,DOCTOR: I'm sorry. 
803,AMY: Get off me! 
804,(The Doctor drags Amy to the Tardis.) 
805,DOCTOR: I'm sorry. 
806,AMY: Get off me. No. 
807,[Tardis]
808,
809,(The Doctor sonicks the Tardis door shut.) 
810,AMY: No! No! No! No! Let me out. Please let me out. I need to get to
811,"Rory. That light. If his body's absorbed, I'll forget him. He'll never"
812,have existed. You can't let that happen. What are you doing? 
813,(The Doctor sets the Tardis in motion.) 
814,"AMY: Doctor, no! No! No! No! "
815,(Rory is absorbed by the light from the crack as the Tardis
816,dematerialises.) 
817,"AMY: Doctor, we can't just leave him there. "
818,"DOCTOR: Keep him in your mind. Don't forget him. If you forget him,"
819,you'll lose him forever. 
820,"AMY: When we were on the Byzantium, I still remembered the Clerics"
821,"because I am a time traveller now, you said. "
822,DOCTOR: They weren't part of your world. This is different. This is
823,your own history changing. 
824,AMY: Don't tell me it's going to be okay. You have to make it okay. 
825,"DOCTOR: It's going to be hard, but you can do it, Amy. Tell me about"
826,"Rory, eh? Fantastic Rory. Funny Rory. Gorgeous Rory. Amy, listen to me."
827,"Do exactly as I say. Amy, please. Keep concentrating. You can do this. "
828,AMY: I can't. 
829,DOCTOR: You can. You can do it. I can't help you unless you do. Come
830,"on. We can still save his memory. Come on, Amy. Please. Come on, Amy,"
831,"come on. Amy, please. Don't let anything distract you. Remember Rory."
832,Keep remembering. Rory's only alive in your memory. You must keep hold
833,of him. Don't let anything distract you. Rory still lives in your mind.
834,
835,(The Tardis comes to a sudden halt. They are thrown to the floor. The
836,ring box lands in front of the Doctor.) 
837,AMY: What were you saying? 
838,"MO: I have seen some things today, but this is beyond mad. "
839,AMY: Doctor. Five seconds till it all goes up.

843,(They all dash outside just in time to see the
844,drilling derrick explode.) 
845,AMY: All Nasreen's work just erased. 
846,MO: Good thing she's not here to see it. She's going to give Tony hell
847,when they wake up.

849,[Church porch]
850,
851,AMBROSE: You could've let those things shoot me.
852,You saved me. 
853,DOCTOR: An eye for an eye. It's never the way. Now you show your son
854,"how wrong you were, how there's another way. You make him the best of"
855,"humanity, in the way you couldn't be."

859,(Amy and the Doctor return to the Tardis.) 
860,"AMY: You're very quiet. Oh. Hey, look. There I am again. Hello, me. "
861,(A lone figure waves back from the other side of the valley.) 
862,DOCTOR: Are you okay? 
863,AMY: I thought I saw someone else there for a second. I need a holiday.
864,Didn't we talk about Rio? 
865,DOCTOR: You go in. Just fix this lock. Keeps jamming. 
866,AMY: You boys and your locksmithery. 
867,"ELDANE: Now, as my people awaken from their thousand year sleep ready"
868,"to rise to the surface, my thoughts turn back to the Doctor. The losses"
869,he suffered then and the greater loses that were still to come.
