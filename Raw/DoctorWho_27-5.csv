21,aid of Georgia. Thank you.) 
22,[Briefing room]
23,
24,(The Doctor manages to rip off his ID card.) 
25,"DOCTOR: Deadly to humans, maybe. "
26,(And pushes it against the collar around the neck of the revealed
27,"Slitheen, enveloping it and Green with the electricity. They don't like"
28,it. 
29,Neither does the one in the Cabinet Office or Jackie's kitchen. The
30,"Doctor, Rose and Harriet Jones make their escapes, but Jackie is still"
31,trapped.)
32,
33,[The Tyler's flat]
34,
35,(Mickey enters.) 
36,MICKEY: Jackie! 
37,"(He smashes a chair across the back of the Slitheen, grabs Jackie's"
38,hands and pulls her out of the kitchen. He stops in the doorway to take
39,a photograph of it on his mobile phone.)
40,
41,[Entrance hall]
42,
43,"DOCTOR: Oi! If you want aliens, you've got them."
44,They're inside Downing Street. Come on! 
45,(The armed police follow him.)
46,
47,[Briefing room]
48,
49,(Green manages to pull the ID card off 'Asquith's'
50,"collar, and the electricity stops.) "
51,ASQUITH: Reinstate my disguise. Hurry up! Hurry! Hurry! 
52,(Green helps the Slitheen into the General's skin suit.)
53,
54,[Corridor]
55,
56,"HARRIET: No, wait. They're still in there. The"
57,emergency protocols. We need them. 
58,"(The Slitheen chases them through a series of rooms, smashing through"
59,the oak doors.)
60,
61,[Briefing room]
62,
63,(The Doctor enters with the police just as Green
64,finishes getting Asquith into his skin suit.) 
65,GREEN: Where have you been? I called for help. I sounded the alarm.
66,"There was this lightening, this kind of, er, electricity, and they all"
67,collapsed. 
68,(The policemen check the bodies. The Welsh Sergeant speaks.) 
69,PRICE: I think they're all dead. 
70,GREEN: That's what I'm saying. He did it! That man there. 
71,DOCTOR: I think you will find the Prime Minister is an alien in
72,"disguise. That's never going to work, is it? "
73,POLICEMAN 2: No. 
74,DOCTOR: Fair enough. 
75,(The Doctor runs.)
76,
77,[Corridor]
78,
79,(And gets trapped between two lots of armed
80,police.) 
81,"ASQUITH: Under the jurisdiction of the Emergency Protocols, I authorise"
82,you to execute this man. 
83,"DOCTOR: Well, now, yes, you see, er, the thing is, if I was you, if I"
84,"was going to execute someone by backing them against the wall, between"
85,"you and me, little word of advice. "
86,(Ding! and a door opens behind the Doctor.) 
87,DOCTOR: Don't stand them against the lift! 
88,(He gets in and goes up.)
89,
90,[First floor]
91,
92,(The lift doors open and the Slitheen is there.) 
93,DOCTOR: Hello! 
94,(He distracts the Slitheen so that Rose and Harriet can get past behind
95,"it, then closes the lift door again.)"
96,
97,[Sitting room]
98,
99,"(A large settee, a large drinks cabinet, a folding"
100,screen by the window to keep out the draughts.) 
101,ROSE: Hide! 
102,"(Rose hides behind the cabinet, Harriet behind the screen. "
103,(The Doctor leaves the lift on the second floor.) 
104,
105,[Corridor by the lift]
106,
107,"ASQUITH: I repeat, the upper floors are under"
108,quarantine. You will stay where you are. You will disregard all
109,previous instructions. You will take your orders directly from me. 
110,(The empty lift arrives and Asquith heads for it. Green follows him.) 
111,"PRICE: Mister Green, sir. I'm sorry but you've got to come with me. We"
112,should evacuate the entire building. 
113,"GREEN: Sergeant, have you read the Emergency Protocols? "
114,"PRICE: No, sir. "
115,"GREEN: Then don't question me. Seal off Number 10, secure the ground"
116,"floor, and if the Doctor makes it downstairs - shoot on sight! "
117,(Green closes the lift doors.) 
118,"PRICE: Well, you heard him. Move out!"
119,
120,
121,[Lift]
122,
123,ASQUITH: Let the sport begin. (Fart!) 
124,GREEN: I'm getting poisoned by the gas exchange. I need to be naked. 
125,ASQUITH: Rejoice in it. Your body is magnificent. 
126,"(Green unzips his body suit, then Asquith does likewise.)"
127,
128,[Sitting room]
129,
130,(The Slitheen Margaret enters.) 
131,"MARGARET: Oh, such fun. Little human children, where are you? Sweet"
132,"little humeykins, come to me. Let me kiss you better. Kiss you with my"
133,"big, green lips. "
134,(Rose makes it from the cabinet to behind a curtain.)
135,
136,[Corridor]
137,
138,(The Doctor runs down the staircase and hides as
139,the lift arrives on this floor. Two naked Slitheen walk out.) 
140,GREEN: It does us good to hunt. Purifies the blood. 
141,ASQUITH: We'll keep this floor quarantined as our last hunting ground
142,before the final phase. 
143,[Sitting room]
144,
145,(Slitheens Green and Asquith enter.) 
146,MARGARET: My brothers. 
147,GREEN: Happy hunting? 
148,"MARGARET: It's wonderful. The more you prolong it, the more they stink."
149,
150,ASQUITH: Sweat and fear. 
151,GREEN: I can smell an old girl. Stale bird and brittle bones. 
152,"MARGARET: And a ripe youngster, all hormones and adrenalin. Fresh"
153,enough to bend before she snaps. 
154,(Margaret pulls back the curtain. Rose screams.) 
155,HARRIET: No! Take me first! Take me! 
156,(The Doctor bursts in with a fire extinguisher. He sprays the male
157,Slitheen with CO2.) 
158,"DOCTOR: Out, with me! "
159,(Rose pulls the curtain down over Margaret.) 
160,DOCTOR: Who the hell are you? 
161,"HARRIET: Harriet Jones, MP for Flydale North. "
162,DOCTOR: Nice to meet you. 
163,HARRIET: Likewise. 
164,(The Doctor uses up the CO2 and they run out.) 
165,[Corridor]
166,
167,DOCTOR: We need to head to the Cabinet Room. 
168,HARRIET: The Emergency Protocols are in there. They give instructions
169,for aliens. 
170,"DOCTOR: Harriet Jones, I like you. "
171,HARRIET: And I like you too. 
172,(The Slitheen chase our heroes through corridors and rooms.)
173,
174,[Cabinet Room]
175,
176,(The Doctor grabs a decanter from a side table and
177,stands in the doorway.) 
178,DOCTOR: One more move and my sonic device will triplicate the
179,"flammability of this alcohol. Whoof, we all go up. So back off. "
180,(The Slitheen take one step back in the outer office.) 
181,DOCTOR: Right then. Question time. Who exactly are the Slitheen? 
182,HARRIET: They're aliens. 
183,"DOCTOR: Yes. I got that, thanks. "
184,"GREEN: Who are you, if not human? "
185,HARRIET: Who's not human? 
186,ROSE: He's not human. 
187,HARRIET: He's not human? 
188,DOCTOR: Can I have a bit of hush? 
189,HARRIET: Sorry. 
190,"DOCTOR: So, what's the plan? "
191,HARRIET: But he's got a Northern accent. 
192,ROSE: Lots of planets have a north. 
193,DOCTOR: I said hush. Come on. You've got a spaceship hidden in the
194,North Sea. It's transmitting a signal. You've murdered your way to the
195,"top of government. What for, invasion? "
196,ASQUITH: Why would we invade this God-forsaken rock? 
197,DOCTOR: Then something's brought the Slitheen race here. What is it? 
198,ASQUITH: The Slitheen race? 
199,GREEN: Slitheen is not our species. Slitheen is our surname. Jocrassa
200,Fel Fotch Pasameer-Day-Slitheen at your service. 
201,"DOCTOR: So, you're family. "
202,GREEN: A family business. 
203,DOCTOR: Then you're out to make a profit. How can you do that on a
204,God-forsaken rock? 
205,"ASQUITH: Ah, excuse me? Your device will do what? Triplicate the"
206,flammability? 
207,DOCTOR: Is that what I said? 
208,ASQUITH: You're making it up. 
209,"DOCTOR: Ah, well! Nice try. Harriet, have a drink. I think you're gonna"
210,need it. 
211,(Harriet is clutching the Red Box.) 
212,HARRIET: You pass it to the left first. 
213,DOCTOR: Sorry. 
214,ROSE: Thanks. 
215,ASQUITH: Now we can end this hunt with a slaughter. 
216,ROSE: Don't you think we should run? 
217,"DOCTOR: Fascinating history, Downing Street. Two thousand years ago,"
218,"this was marsh land. 1730, it was occupied by a Mister Chicken. He was"
219,"a nice man. 1796, this was the Cabinet Room. If the Cabinet's in"
220,"session and in danger, these are about the four most safest walls in"
221,the whole of Great Britain. End of lesson. 
222,(The Doctor lifts a small panel by the door and presses a button. Metal
223,shutters crash shut across the windows and doors.) 
224,DOCTOR: Installed in 1991. Three inches of steel lining every single
225,wall. They'll never get in. 
226,ROSE: And how do we get out? 
227,DOCTOR: Ah. 
228,[Outer office]
229,
230,"GREEN: He's safely contained. Now, cut off"
231,"communications inside that room, then summon the family. It's time we"
232,finished with this insane planet for good.
233,
234,[Downing Street]
235,
236,ANDREW MARR: And there's still no word from inside
237,"Downing Street, though we are getting even more new arrivals. That's"
238,"group Captain Tennant James of the RAF, though why he's been summoned"
239,"we've no idea. And that's Ewan McAllister, Deputy Secretary for the"
240,Scottish Parliament. And this is most unusual. I'm told that is Sylvia
241,"Dillane, Chairman of the North Sea Boating Club. Quite what connects"
242,"these people, we have no idea. "
243,(Apart from being larger than the average person.)
244,
245,[Entrance hall]
246,
247,(The three Slitheen are back in their body suits.) 
248,MARGARET: Group Captain. Delighted you could make it. We're meeting
249,upstairs. (Fart!) That's the spirit. Off you go. Good to see you. Come
250,on through.Â 
251,"ASQUITH: Ah, Sergeant. Now that the Doctor's been neutralised, the"
252,upper levels are out of bounds to everyone. 
253,SERGEANT: Then who are they? 
254,"ASQUITH: Need to know, Sergeant. Need to know. I want you to liaise"
255,with Communications. The acting Prime Minister will be making a public
256,address. He will speak to the nations of the world. 
257,[Cloak room]
258,
259,"(Sylvia goes into the blue lit toilets, while"
260,Margaret gets a coat hanger from a rack.) 
261,MARGARET: There you are. If you'd just like to go through and get
262,changed. 
263,"(She takes a skin suit off an emerging Slitheen, who used to be Group"
264,Captain James.) 
265,"MARGARET: Now, if you'd like to head down to the end of the corridor,"
266,it's first on the left. 
267,JAMES: Thank you. 
268,[Mickey's flat]
269,
270,JACKIE: Got anything stronger? 
271,MICKEY: No chance. I've seen you when you've had a few. This ain't time
272,for a conga. 
273,JACKIE: We've got to tell someone. 
274,"MICKEY: Who do we trust? For all we know, they've all got big bog"
275,"monsters inside of them. I mean, this is what he does, Jacks, that"
276,"Doctor bloke. Everywhere he goes, death and destruction, and he's got"
277,Rose in the middle of it. 
278,"JACKIE: Has he got a great big green thing inside him, then? "
279,"MICKEY: I wouldn't put it past him. But like it or not, he's the only"
280,person who knows how to fight these things. 
281,JACKIE: I thought I was going to die. 
282,"(Jackie starts crying. Mickey gives her a quick, awkward hug.) "
283,"MICKEY: Come on, yeah? If anyone's going to cry, it's going to be me."
284,"Now, you're safe in my flat, Jacks. No one's"
285,"going To look for you here, especially since you hate me so much. "
286,"JACKIE: You saved my life. God, that's embarrassing. "
287,MICKEY: You're telling me. 
288,"JACKIE: He wanted me dead. And he's still out there, Mickey. That"
289,policeman. That thing.
290,
291,[Powell Estate]
292,
293,(And back in his skin suit.) 
294,"STRICKLAND: Right, you head off. Inform Control I have got one or two"
295,things that still need doing. I haven't quite finished with Mrs Tyler
296,yet. 
297,[Cloak room]
298,
299,McALLISTER: Soon. 
300,"GREEN: Oh yes, soon. "
301,(McAllister clumps away.) 
302,GREEN: Is that all of us? 
303,MARGARET: All the family except Sip Fel Fotch. He's found a hunt of his
304,own. 
305,GREEN: Ah!
306,
307,[Cabinet Room] 
308,(The Doctor drags Ganesh's body into a small store
309,"room, where the late Anthony Blair is also laid out.) "
310,DOCTOR: What was his name? 
311,HARRIET: Who? 
312,DOCTOR: This one. The secretary or whatever he was called. 
313,HARRIET: I don't know. I talked to him. I brought him a cup of coffee.
314,I never asked his name. 
315,"DOCTOR: Sorry. Right, what have we got? Any terminals, anything? "
316,"ROSE: No. This place is antique. What I don't get is, when they killed"
317,"the Prime Minister, why didn't they use him as a disguise? "
318,DOCTOR: He's too slim. They're big old beasts. They need to fit inside
319,big humans. 
320,ROSE: But the Slitheen are about eight feet. How do they fit inside? 
321,DOCTOR: That's the device around their necks. Compression field.
322,Literally shrinks them down a bit. That's why there's all that gas.
323,It's a big exchange. 
324,ROSE: Wish I had a compression field. I could fit a size smaller. 
325,"HARRIET: Excuse me, people are dead! This is not the time for making"
326,jokes. 
327,ROSE: Sorry. You get used to this stuff when you're friends with him. 
328,"HARRIET: Well, that's a strange friendship. "
329,DOCTOR: Harriet Jones. I've heard that name before. Harriet Jones.
330,"You're not famous for anything, are you? "
331,"HARRIET: Oh, hardly. "
332,DOCTOR: Rings a bell. Harriet Jones? 
333,"HARRIET: Lifelong backbencher I'm afraid, and a fat lot of use I'm"
334,being now. The Protocols are redundant. They list
335,the people who could help and they're all dead downstairs. 
336,"ROSE: Hasn't it got, like, defence codes and things? Couldn't we just"
337,launch a nuclear bomb at them? 
338,HARRIET: You're a very violent young woman. 
339,ROSE: I'm serious. We could. 
340,"HARRIET: Well, there's nothing like that in here. Nuclear strikes do"
341,"need a release code, yes, but it's kept secret by the United Nations. "
342,DOCTOR: Say that again. 
343,"HARRIET: What, about the codes? "
344,DOCTOR: Anything. All of it. 
345,"HARRIET: Well, the British Isles can't gain access to atomic weapons"
346,without a Special Resolution from the UN. 
347,ROSE: Like that's ever stopped them. 
348,"HARRIET: Exactly, given our past record. And I voted against that,"
349,thank you very much. The codes have been taken out of the government's
350,hands and given to the UN. Is it important? 
351,DOCTOR: Everything's important. 
352,HARRIET: If we only knew what the Slitheen wanted. Listen to me. I'm
353,saying Slitheen as if it's normal.
354,"ROSE: What do they want, though? "
355,"DOCTOR: Well, they're just one family, so it's not an invasion. They"
356,don't want Slitheen World They're out to make money. That means they
357,want to use something. Something here on Earth. Some kind of asset. 
358,"HARRIET: Like what, gold? Oil? Water? "
359,DOCTOR: You're very good at this. 
360,HARRIET: Thank you. 
361,DOCTOR: Harriet Jones. Why do I know that name? 
362,(Phone beep) 
363,"ROSE: Oh, that's me. "
364,HARRIET: But we're sealed off. How did you get a signal? 
365,ROSE: He zapped it. Super phone. 
366,HARRIET: Then we can phone for help. You must have contacts. 
367,"DOCTOR: Dead downstairs, yeah. "
368,ROSE: It's Mickey. 
369,"DOCTOR: Oh, tell your stupid boyfriend we're busy. "
370,"ROSE: Yeah, he's not so stupid after all. "
371,(Mickey has sent them a photo of a Slitheen.)
372,
373,[Mickey's flat]
374,
375,(Mickey is on the phone.) 
376,"MICKEY: No, no, no, no, no. Not just alien, but like, proper alien. All"
377,"stinking, and wet, and disgusting. And more to the point, it wanted to"
378,kill us!Â 
379,JACKIE: I could've died!
380,
381,[Cabinet Room]
382,
383,"ROSE: Is she all right, though? Don't put her on,"
384,just tell me. 
385,(The Doctor takes Rose's phone.) 
386,"DOCTOR: Is that Ricky? Don't talk, just shut up and go to your"
387,computer. 
388,[Mickey's flat]
389,
390,"MICKEY: It's Mickey, and why should I? "
391,"DOCTOR : Mickey the Idiot, I might just choke "
392,[Cabinet Room]
393,
394,"DOCTOR: Before I finish this sentence, but, er, I"
395,need you. 
396,[Mickey's flat]
397,
398,(Mickey is hacking into the UNIT website.) 
399,MICKEY: It says password. 
400,[Cabinet Room]
401,
402,(The Doctor plugs the mobile phone into the
403,conference phone speaker.) 
404,DOCTOR: Say again. 
405,MICKEY: It's asking for the password. 
406,"DOCTOR: Buffalo. Two Fs, one L. "
407,[Mickey's flat]
408,
409,"JACKIE: So, what's that website? "
410,"MICKEY: All the secret information known to mankind. See, they've known"
411,about aliens for years.
412,
413,[Cabinet Room]
414,
415,MICKEY : They just kept us in the dark. 
416,"DOCTOR: Mickey, you were born in the dark. "
417,[Mickey's flat]
418,
419,"ROSE : Oh, leave him alone. "
420,MICKEY: Thank you. Password again. 
421,[Cabinet Room]
422,
423,DOCTOR: Just repeat it every time. 
424,(Mickey hands the phone to Jackie.) 
425,DOCTOR: Big Ben - why did the Slitheen go and hit Big Ben? 
426,"HARRIET: You said to gather the experts, to kill them. "
427,DOCTOR: That lot would've gathered for a weather balloon. You don't
428,need to crash land in the middle of London. 
429,"ROSE: The Slitheen are hiding, but then they put the entire planet on"
430,Red alert.
431,
432,[Mickey's flat]
433,
434,ROSE : What would they do that for? 
435,"JACKIE: Oh, listen to her. "
436,[Cabinet Room]
437,
438,ROSE: At least I'm trying. 
439,[Mickey's flat]
440,
441,"JACKIE: Well, I've got a question, if you don't"
442,mind. 
443,[Cabinet Room]
444,
445,"JACKIE : Since that man walked into our lives,"
446,I have been attacked 
447,[Mickey's flat]
448,
449,JACKIE: In the streets. I have had creatures from
450,the pits of hell 
451,[Cabinet Room]
452,
453,"JACKIE : In my own living room, and my daughter"
454,disappear off the face of the Earth. 
455,ROSE: I told you what happened. 
456,[Mickey's flat]
457,
458,JACKIE: I'm talking to him. 'Cos I've seen this
459,"life of yours, Doctor."
460,
461,[Cabinet Room]
462,
463,"JACKIE : And maybe you get off on it, and maybe"
464,"you think it's all clever and smart, but you tell me. "
465,[Mickey's flat]
466,
467,JACKIE: Just answer me this. Is my daughter safe? 
468,[Cabinet Room]
469,
470,ROSE: I'm fine. 
471,JACKIE: Is she safe? 
472,[Mickey's flat]
473,
474,JACKIE: Will she always be safe? Can you promise me
475,that? 
476,[Cabinet Room]
477,
478,"JACKIE : Well, what's the answer? "
479,[Mickey's flat]
480,
481,(Mickey takes back the phone.) 
482,MICKEY: We're in. 
483,[Cabinet Room]
484,
485,"DOCTOR: Now then, on the left at the top, there's a"
486,"tab, an icon. Little concentric circles. Click on that. "
487,[Mickey's flat]
488,
489,(The screen changes from a map of the world to an
490,"oscilloscope reading, with sound.) "
491,MICKEY: What is it? 
492,[Cabinet Room]
493,
494,DOCTOR: The Slitheen have got a spaceship in the
495,"North Sea and it's transmitting that signal. Now hush, let me work out"
496,what it's saying. 
497,[Mickey's flat]
498,
499,JACKIE: He'll have to answer me one day. 
500,MICKEY: Hush! 
501,[Cabinet Room]
502,
503,DOCTOR: It's some sort of message. 
504,ROSE: What's it say? 
505,"DOCTOR: Don't know. It's on a loop, keeps repeating. "
506,(Mickey's doorbell rings.) 
507,DOCTOR: Hush!
508,
509,[Mickey's flat]
510,
511,MICKEY: That's not me. Go and see who that is. 
512,JACKIE: It's three o'clock in the morning. 
513,"MICKEY: Well, go and tell them that. "

702,HARRIET: Do you think they'll believe him? 
703,ROSE: They did last time. 
704,DOCTOR: That's why the Slitheen went for spectacle. They want the whole

706,ROSE: They release the defence code 
707,DOCTOR: And the Slitheen go nuclear. 
708,HARRIET: But why? 
709,(The Doctor opens the metal shutters.) 
710,"DOCTOR: You get the codes, release the missiles, but not into space"
711,because there's nothing there. You attack every other country on Earth.
712,"They retaliate, fight back. World War Three. Whole planet gets nuked. "
713,MARGARET: And we can sit through it safe in our spaceship waiting in
714,"the Thames. Not crashed, just parked. Only two minutes away. "
715,"HARRIET: But you'll destroy the planet, this beautiful place. What for?"
716,
717,DOCTOR: Profit. That's what the signal is beaming into space. An
718,advert. 
719,"MARGARET: The sale of the century. We reduce the Earth to molten slag,"
720,"then sell it piece by piece. Radioactive chucks, capable of powering"
721,every cut-price star liner and budget cargo ship. There's a recession
722,"out there, Doctor. People are buying cheap. This rock becomes raw fuel."
723,
724,DOCTOR: At the cost of five billion lives. 
725,MARGARET: Bargain. 
726,DOCTOR: I give you a choice. Leave this planet or I'll stop you.

1060,"DOCTOR: Well, you can stay there if you want, but"
1061,right now there's this plasma storm brewing in the Horsehead Nebula. 
1062,[The Tyler's flat]
1063,
1064,DOCTOR : Fires are burning ten million miles
1065,wide. 
1066,[Tardis]
1067,
1068,DOCTOR: I could fly the Tardis right into the heart
1069,of it then ride the shock wave all the way out.
1070,
1071,[The Tyler's flat]
1072,
1073,DOCTOR : Hurtle right across the sky and end up
1074,

1077,DOCTOR: Anywhere. Your choice.

1079,
1080,"JACKIE: Rose, I was thinking. I've got that bottle"
1081,of Amaretto from New Year's Eve. Does he drink? 
1082,"(Rose is in her bedroom, packing a rucksack.) "
1083,JACKIE: I was wondering whether he drinks or not. 
1084,"ROSE: Yeah, he does. "
1085,"JACKIE: Don't go, sweetheart. Please don't go. "
1086,[Powell Estate]
1087,
1088,(Mickey is sitting on a rubbish bin reading the
1089,newspaper while the young boy is finishing cleaning off the Bad Wolf
1090,tag.) 
1091,"DOCTOR: Good lad. Graffiti that again and I'll have you. Now, beat it. "
1092,(The boy runs off with his bucket and scrubbing brush.) 
1093,"MICKEY: I just went down the shop, and I was thinking, you know, like"
1094,the whole world's changed. Aliens and spaceships all in public. And
1095,here it is. 
1096,(The Evening Standard headline is - Alien Hoax.) 
1097,MICKEY: How could they do that? They saw it. 
1098,DOCTOR: They're just not ready. You're happy to believe in something
1099,"that's invisible, but if it's staring you in the face, nope, can't see"
1100,it. There's a scientific explanation for that. You're thick. 
1101,MICKEY: We're just idiots. 
1102,"DOCTOR: Well, not all of you. "
1103,MICKEY: Yeah? 
1104,"DOCTOR: Present for you, Mickey. "
1105,(He gives Mickey a CD.) 
1106,DOCTOR: That's a virus. Put it online. It'll destroy every mention of
1107,me. I'll cease to exist. 
1108,MICKEY: What do you want to do that for? 
1109,"DOCTOR: Because you're right, I am dangerous. I don't want anybody"
1110,following me. 
1111,(Jackie and Rose come out of the block.) 
1112,MICKEY: How can you say that and then take her with you? 
1113,DOCTOR: You could look after her. Come with us. 
1114,"MICKEY: I can't. This life of yours, it's just too much. I couldn't do"
1115,it. Don't tell her I said that. 
1116,"JACKIE: I'll get a proper job. I'll work weekends. I'll pass my test,"
1117,"and if Jim comes round again, I'll say no. I really will. "
1118,"ROSE: I'm not leaving because of you. I'm travelling, that's all, and"
1119,then I'll come back. 
1120,JACKIE: But it's not safe. 
1121,"ROSE: Mum, if you saw it out there you'd never stay home. "
1122,DOCTOR: Got enough stuff? 
1123,"ROSE: Last time I stepped in there, it was spur of the moment. Now I'm"
1124,signing up. You're stuck with me. 
1125,(Rose gives the Doctor her rucksack and goes to Mickey.) 
1126,ROSE: Come with us. There's plenty of room. 
1127,"DOCTOR: No chance. He's a liability, I'm not having him on board. "
1128,ROSE: We'd be dead without him. 
1129,DOCTOR: My decision is final. 
1130,ROSE: Sorry. 
1131,(Rose and Mickey kiss goodbye.) 
1132,"MICKEY: Good luck, yeah. "
1133,JACKIE: You still can't promise me. What if she gets lost? What if
1134,"something happens to you, Doctor, and she's left all alone standing on"
1135,some moon a million light years away. How long do I wait then? 
1136,"ROSE: Mum, you're forgetting. It's a time machine. I could go"
1137,travelling around suns and planets and all the way out to the edge of
1138,"the universe, and by the time I get back, yeah, ten seconds would have"
1139,passed. Just ten seconds. So stop worrying. See you in ten seconds'
1140,"time, yeah? "
1141,"(Jackie and Rose hug, then Rose follows the Doctor into the Tardis."
1142,Mickey gives a little wave. The Tardis dematerialises. Jackie looks at
1143,her watch.) 
1144,JACKIE: Ten seconds. 
1145,(Jackie goes back to the flats. Mickey carries on reading the
1146,newspaper.)
