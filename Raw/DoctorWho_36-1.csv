18,                  (A symmetrical wood-panelled room. Over the
19,                  mantelpiece hangs a 1661 Rembrandt self-portrait. The
20,                  clock on it ticks away as shuffling footsteps
21,"                  approach, then Nardole enters through the left hand"
22,"                  door from our point of view, followed by a sulky girl"
23,                  of dark complexion with a touch of the River Song
24,                  about her. Nardole's arm squeaks mechanically as he
25,"                  gestures for her to sit in front of the desk, then a"
26,"                  bolt falls off. He smiles and kicks it behind him,"
27,                  then backs out and closes the door. The girl
28,                  investigates the Police Telephone Box parked in the
29,                  corner by a window. It has an 'Out of Order' sign
30,                  hanging on the door. The desk has photographs of Susan
31,                  Foreman and Melody Pond aka River Song on it. The
32,                  clock chimes. Bill is reaching for the pot that
33,"                  contains not pencils or pens, but sonic screwdrivers,"
34,                  when suddenly the peace is ripped apart by an electric
35,                  guitar playing Beethoven's Fifth. And if this turns
36,                  out to be Saint Cedd's College Cambridge I wouldn't be
37,                  surprised.)
38,                  BILL: Ahem! 
39,"                  (Silence, then rock star Doctor puts his head out of"
40,"                  the right hand door, then back in again. There is the"
41,                  whir of a sonic screwdriver and a bit of amplifier
42,"                  feedback, then he comes out again.)"
43,                  DOCTOR: Potts? 
44,                  BILL: Yeah.
45,                  DOCTOR: Bill Potts.
46,                  BILL: You wanted to see me.
47,"                  DOCTOR: Er, you're not a student at this university."
48,"                  BILL: Nah, I work in the canteen. "
49,"                  DOCTOR: Yeah, but you come to my lectures."
50,"                  BILL: No, I don't. I never do that."
51,                  DOCTOR: I've seen you.
52,                  BILL: Love your lectures. They're totally awesome.
53,                  DOCTOR: Why'd you come to my lectures when you're not
54,                  a student?
55,"                  BILL: Okay, so my first day here, in the canteen, I"
56,                  was on chips. There was this girl. Student. Beautiful.
57,"                  Like a model, only with talking and thinking. She"
58,"                  looked at you and you perved. Every time, automatic,"
59,"                  like physics. Eye contact, perversion. So I gave her"
60,"                  extra chips. Every time, extra chips. Like a reward"
61,"                  for all the perversion. Every day, got myself on"
62,"                  chips, rewarded her. Then finally, finally, she looked"
63,"                  at me, like she'd noticed, actually noticed, all the"
64,                  extra chips. Do you know what I realised? She was fat.
65,"                  I'd fatted her. But that's life, innit? Beauty or"
66,                  chips. I like chips.
67,                  So did she. So that's okay.
68,                  DOCTOR: And how does that in any way explain why you
69,                  keep coming to my lectures?
70,"                  BILL: Yeah, it doesn't really, does it? I was hoping"
71,                  something would develop. What's that? A police
72,                  telephone box?
73,                  DOCTOR: Yeah. 
74,                  BILL: Did you build it from a kit?
75,"                  DOCTOR: No, it came like that. "
76,                  BILL: Then how did you get it in here? The door's too
77,                  small and so are the windows.
78,                  DOCTOR: I had the window and a part of the wall taken
79,                  out and it was lifted in.
80,"                  BILL: What, with a crane?"
81,"                  DOCTOR: Yeah, with a crane. It's heavier than it"
82,                  looks. Why do you keep coming to my lectures? 
83,                  BILL: Because I like them. Everybody likes them.
84,                  They're amazing. Why me? 
85,                  DOCTOR: Why you what? 
86,"                  BILL: Well, plenty of people come to your lectures"
87,                  that aren't supposed to. Why pick on me? 
88,"                  DOCTOR: Well, I noticed you. "
89,"                  BILL: Yeah, but why?"
90,"                  DOCTOR: Well, most people when don' t understand"
91,"                  something, they frown. You smile."
92,                  BILL: I'll tell you what I don't understand. You've
93,"                  been lecturing here for a long time. Like, fifty"
94,"                  years, some people say. Nabeela in the office says"
95,                  over seventy.
96,"                  DOCTOR: Yeah, and you're thinking, 'Well, he doesn't"
97,                  look old enough'.
98,                  BILL: No. I'm wondering what you're supposed to be
99,                  lecturing on. It's like the university let you do
100,"                  whatever you like. One time, you were going to give a"
101,                  lecture on quantum physics. You talked about poetry.
102,"                  DOCTOR: Poetry, physics, same thing."
103,                  BILL: How is it the same?
104,                  DOCTOR: Because of the rhymes. What are you doing at
105,                  this university?
106,                  BILL: I always wanted to come here.
107,"                  DOCTOR: Yeah, to serve chips?"
108,"                  BILL: So anyway, am I nearly done?"
109,                  DOCTOR: Do you want to be?
110,                  BILL: See ya.
111,"                  DOCTOR: You ever get less than a first, then it's"
112,                  over.
113,                  BILL: You what? 
114,"                  DOCTOR: A first. Every time, or I stop immediately. "
115,                  BILL: Stop what?
116,                  DOCTOR: Being your personal tutor.
117,                  BILL: But I'm not a student. I'm not part of the
118,                  university. I never even applied.
119,                  DOCTOR: We'll sort all that out later. 
120,                  BILL: You kinda have to sort that out earlier.
121,                  DOCTOR: Leave it with me. I'm assuming that it's a
122,                  yes.
123,                  BILL: Yes. 
124,                  DOCTOR: I'll see you at 6pm every weekday. I don't
125,"                  care who's dying, never, ever be late. I'm very"
126,                  particular about time.
127,"                  BILL: Oh, er. People just call you the Doctor? What do"
128,                  I call you?
129,                  DOCTOR: The Doctor.
130,                  BILL: But Doctor's not a name. I can't just call you
131,                  Doctor. Doctor what?

135,"                  (Intercut with Bill waking up, cooking chips in the"
136,"                  canteen, and serving big portions to a well-built"
137,                  woman and winking at her.)
138,                  DOCTOR: Time! Time doesn't pass. The passage of time
139,"                  is an illusion, and life is the magician. Because life"
140,                  only lets you see one day at a time. You remember
141,"                  being alive yesterday, you hope you're going to be"
142,"                  alive tomorrow, so it feels like you're travelling"
143,                  from one to the other. But nobody's moving anywhere.
144,                  Movies don't really move. 
145,                  (Six o'clock.)
146,"                  DOCTOR: They're just pictures, lots and lots of"
147,"                  pictures. All of them still, none of them moving. Just"
148,                  frozen moments. 
149,"                  (Bill is at the door, ready to knock.)"
150,                  DOCTOR: But if you experience those pictures one after
151,"                  the other, then everything comes alive."
152,
153,[Office]
154,
155,(The door swings open.)
156,                  BILL: Am I on time?
157,                  DOCTOR: That's a very big question.

167,                  foster tutor.
168,                  MOIRA: Am I going to have to break every bone in his
169,                  body?
170,                  BILL: It's not like that.
171,                  MOIRA: You need to keep your eye on men.
172,"                  BILL: (sotto) Men aren't where I keep my eye,"
173,                  actually.
174,
175,[Lecture hall]
176,
177,                  DOCTOR: Imagine if time all happened at once. Every
178,                  moment of your life laid out around you like a city.
179,                  Streets full of buildings made of days. The day you
180,"                  were born, the day you die. The day you fall in love,"
181,                  the day that love ends. A whole city built from
182,                  triumph and heartbreak and boredom and laughter and
183,                  cutting your toenails. It's the best place you will
184,                  ever be.

189,                  crowded bar.)
190,                  DOCTOR : Time is a structure relative to
191,                  ourselves.
192,                  BILL: I'll get them in.
193,                  DOCTOR: : Time is the space made by our lives

200,"                  (Transcriber's note. Although this is the original derivation of Tardis, it wasn't long until Dimensions "
201,became plural. Is this what Mr Moffat meant when he said that this season 'begins the show
202,                    again'? Because there's an awful lot of
203,                    self-referencing going on that new watchers will not
204,                    get. Argh!)

212,                  Nardole turning the wrong way originally. She follows

220,                  DOCTOR : Why not?
221,                  NARDOLE : You're not supposed to get involved.
222,"                  What are you teaching her, anyway?"

225,                  everything?
226,                  DOCTOR : Because everything rhymes. Links apple

554,                  DOCTOR: Nothing gets through these doors.
555,                  BILL: But they're made of wood. They've got windows!
556,                  (The Doctor goes down the ramp and turns on the power.
557,                  Bill doesn't turn around.)

559,                  girl I told you about. Heather. Only I don't think
560,                  it's really her. I know this is hard to believe. I
561,                  know you're not exactly a sci-fi person
562,                  (Then she turns around.)
563,                  DOCTOR: Time And Relative Dimension In Space. TARDIS
564,                  for short. You're safe in here. You're safe in here
565,                  and you always will be. Any questions?
566,                  BILL: Is this a knock-through?
567,"                  DOCTOR: Well, in a way, yes."
568,                  BILL: Look at this place. It's like a
569,                  DOCTOR: Spaceship.
570,                  BILL: Kitchen.
571,                  DOCTOR: A what? 
572,"                  BILL: A really posh kitchen, all metal. What happened"
573,"                  with the doors, though? Did you run out of money?"
574,                  DOCTOR: What you are standing in is a technological
575,                  marvel. It is science beyond magic. This is the
576,"                  gateway to everything that ever was, or ever can be."
577,                  BILL: Can I use the toilet?
578,                  DOCTOR: Pardon? 
579,                  BILL: I've had a fright. I need the toilet.
580,"                  DOCTOR: It's down there, first right, second left,"
581,                  past the macaroon dispenser.
582,                  BILL: Thanks.

585,                  repel her?
586,                  DOCTOR: She's just passing through. She wants to use
587,                  the toilet.
588,"                  NARDOLE: Oh. I'd er give it a minute, if I were you."

590,"                  NARDOLE:  Ooo, what was that?"
591,                  DOCTOR: We have an incursion on campus.
592,                  Extra-terrestrial. We're under attack.
593,                  (Wet Heather is on the scanner.)

597,"                  DOCTOR: No, it's not just a room."
598,                  BILL: This is a lift!
599,                  (The Tardis materialises.)

605,                  vault's secure.
606,                  BILL: So your box can move? It can go anywhere it
607,                  likes?
608,"                  NARDOLE: Mmm. Good, innit?"
609,"                  BILL: Anywhere at all, in the whole university?"

611,                  screwdriver.)

613,                  than normal?
614,                  (Bill looks back inside the Tardis.)
615,                  BILL: Hang on. The room's still inside the box. This
616,                  isn't a knock-through. 
617,                  DOCTOR: No.
618,                  BILL: Doctor! It's bigger on the inside than it is on
619,                  the outside!
620,                  NARDOLE: Way-hey! We got there!
621,                  (Nardole and the Doctor shake hands.)
622,                  BILL: How is that possible? How do you do that?
623,"                  NARDOLE: Well, first you have to imagine a very big"
624,                  box fitting inside a very small box.
625,                  BILL: Okay. 
626,                  NARDOLE: Then you have to make one. It's the second
627,                  part people normally get stuck on.
628,"                  DOCTOR: Can we shut up, please? Busy, busy. I need to"
629,                  know if there's anyinterest in what's inside this
630,                  vault. 
631,"                  BILL: Why, what's inside it?"
632,                  DOCTOR: Something I don't want anyone being too
633,                  curious about.
634,                  BILL: So you put it in the middle of a university?
635,"                  NARDOLE: Ooo, valid point. Yeah, nice."
636,                  DOCTOR: Either the creature came here specifically for
637,"                  what's in here, or it's just a coincidence."
638,                  BILL: It's just a coincidence.
639,"                  DOCTOR: Well, we can't know that for sure."
640,"                  BILL: Yeah, we can. It was here for ages before it did"
641,"                  anything. If it had work to do, why would it lie"
642,                  around in a puddle?
643,                  DOCTOR: I don't know. Maybe it's a student?
644,"                  NARDOLE: Oh, (laughs) banter. It's good, this. Your go"
645,                  again.
646,                  (Liquid is pouring down the cellar steps.)
647,"                  DOCTOR: Nardole, we need to move away from the doors"
648,                  and towards the Tardis.
649,"                  (Liquid pours down the steps, then Heather rises from"
650,                  the puddle at the bottom.)
651,                  NARDOLE: What if it attacks us?
652,"                  DOCTOR: Well, that's the good news. It means it's not"
653,                  interested in what's inside the vault. It just wants
654,                  to kill us.
655,                  NARDOLE: Oh.
656,                  DOCTOR: Run!

662,                  us. Let's give it a proper challenge. Let's see how
663,                  far she's prepared to go.
664,                  (The Tardis dematerialises.)
665,                  BILL: But what about my friend? What about Heather?
666,                  Can you save her?
667,                  (And materialises.)
668,                  DOCTOR: First things first. Let's see if we can
669,                  survive her.

678,                  DOCTOR: Yes.
679,                  BILL: We've moved again. 
680,                  DOCTOR: We have.

711,                  work in any other language!

715,                  sort of hides itself.

766,                  BILL: Why? Is everything out here evil?

782,                  DOCTOR: But it spent ages laying around being a

795,"                  single tear drop, alone in a strange world. Then, one"
796,"                  day, it finds someone who wants to fly away."

810,"                  DOCTOR: Of course it is, everything is. "
811,                  NARDOLE: But what?
812,"                  DOCTOR: What, in the end, are any of us looking for?"
813,                  We're looking for someone who's looking for us.
814,"                  BILL [memory]: Hey, still making eyes at a puddle?"
815,"                  (Then Heather screams, grabs Bill's face, and tries to"
816,                  pull her down.)

818,                  (The Doctor and Nardole pull Bill free.)

824,"                  DOCTOR: Okay, it's fast. It time travels. It never"
825,                  gives up.
826,                  (The Tardis zooms through space.)
827,                  DOCTOR:  Plan! Basic sterilisation. We're going
828,                  to run that thing through the deadliest fire in the
829,                  universe. 
830,"                  NARDOLE: Yes, that sounds excellent. The deadliest"
831,                  fire in the universe. That's definitely good.
832,                  BILL: How do we do that?
833,                  DOCTOR: The only way we can. We run through it first.
834,                  
835,                  NARDOLE: Less good now.
836,                  (The Tardis shakes. Nardole looks at the scanner.)

839,                  DOCTOR: Nardole! 
840,                  NARDOLE: I don't like there.
841,"                  (The Doctor throws the sonic screwdriver to Nardole,"
842,                  who catches it.)
843,                  DOCTOR: I want you running interference. Can you do
844,                  that?
845,"                  NARDOLE: Can I say no, sir? "
846,                  DOCTOR: No. 
847,"                  NARDOLE: Yes, then. "
848,                  DOCTOR: Thank you.
849,                  NARDOLE: But no really. 
850,                  BILL: Where are we?
851,"                  DOCTOR: Well, we're basically in the middle of a war."
852,"                  No, but, well, it's a war zone, and this is just your"
853,"                  basic skirmish. And it's not as bad as it sounds, I"
854,"                  promise you. Come on, I've got friends here, old"
855,                  friends.

867,                  DOCTOR: No. This is the past.
868,"                  BILL: Doesn't, doesn't look like the past. Are we safe"
869,                  here?

997,                  She was going to let me fly with her. She was inviting
998,                  me. I was too scared.
999,                  DOCTOR: Scared is good. Scared is rational. She wasn't
