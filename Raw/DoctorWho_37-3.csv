16,"Montgomery, Alabama 1943"
17,
18,"MUSIC: I woke up this morning with my mind set on freedom. I woke up this morning with my mind, Lord, set on freedom...  "
19,"(Er, that song was actually developed from a gospel song in the 1960s... ) "
20,A young African-American woman is waiting at a bus stop. 
21,
22,
23,[Bus]
24,
25,"(The majority of seats are labelled 'White', and are empty, just one row is labelled Colored. There are a lot of African-Americans standing at the back. "
26,The woman pays her fare and starts to walk down the aisle. The driver speaks.)
27,"BLAKE: Hey, you. You don't go that way. That way's not for coloureds. Get off, go round to the back and get on there. That's your entrance. You know that. "
28,"ROSA: I don't see the need for getting off, then back on there. Not when there's folks standing in the stepwell. How am I going to squeeze on there? "
29,"BLAKE: If you ain't going through that back door, you're getting off my bus. "
30,(He grabs her arm.) 
31,"ROSA: Sir, let me go. Please don't do that. Stop. "
32,"(She drops her handbag, then sits on a White seat and reaches down to pick it up.) "
33,ROSA: You better not hit me. 
34,BLAKE: Get out that door! 
35,
36,[Street]
37,
38,"(Rosa leaves the bus and goes to the rear door, which he closes in her face. She knocks on it, but he drives off.) "
39,"ROSA: Hey. Hey. Hey, hold on. Hey, stop!"
40,
41, Twelve years later 1955 
42,
43,(The Tardis materialises in an alley and the Doctor pokes her head out.) 
44,DOCTOR: Nearly.
45,
46,[Tardis]
47,
48,YASMIN: Sheffield? 
49,DOCTOR: Almost. Really close. 
50,"GRAHAM: So not Sheffield, then? "
51,"DOCTOR: You're doing this deliberately, aren't you? "
52,YASMIN: Who are you talking to? 
53,"RYAN: If it's me, I haven't touched anything. "
54,"DOCTOR: I'm talking to the Tardis, because this is our ninth attempt. "
55,"GRAHAM: Fourteenth. You can't control this thing, can you? "
56,"DOCTOR: Excuse me. Yes, I can. Most of the time. Just sometimes, like now, it has a mind of its own. "
57,"YASMIN: So where are we, actually? "
58,"DOCTOR: Earth, United States. 1955, Montgomery, Alabama, if I'm reading this properly. New displays. Still figuring them out. "
59,GRAHAM: 1955? Elvis. Could we see Elvis? 
60,DOCTOR: I think he's in New York this week. I could give him a call. 
61,GRAHAM: You haven't got Elvis's phone number. 
62,DOCTOR: Don't ever tell anyone I lent him a mobile phone. 
63,(Alarm sounds.) 
64,"DOCTOR: Whoa, what's that? Traces of artron energy? "
65,YASMIN: Should we know what artron energy is? 
66,"DOCTOR: It's the same type of energy the Tardis runs off. There really shouldn't be traces of artron energy here, unless they're ours, which they're not.  "
67,YASMIN: And now you want to check it out. 
68,"DOCTOR: Yeah, I should. Quick look, but quietly. History is very delicate. We stick together."
69,
70,[Street]
71,
72,(The Doctor keeps checking her Sheffield sonic.) 
73,YASMIN: Real-life 1950s. Time travel's awesome. 
74,"(A passing woman drops her glove, Ryan picks it up.) "
75,RYAN: Excuse me. Excuse me. You dropped this. 
76,"(Her husband slaps Ryan across the face, hard.) "
77,RYAN: Hey.  
78,(Graham grabs Ryan.) 
79,STEELE: Get your filthy black hands off my wife.  
80,DOCTOR: Whoa. Stop. 
81,"YASMIN: Sir, please take a step back. You okay, Ryan? "
82,RYAN: I was just trying to give her back her glove. 
83,(Throws it back on the ground.) 
84,STEELE: Is this your boy? 
85,"GRAHAM: He's my grandson, actually. "
86,STEELE: Your what?  
87,GRAHAM: My grandson. 
88,STEELE: You ain't from around here. 
89,DOCTOR: We don't want any trouble. 
90,"STEELE: I don't know how it goes where you folks are from, but your boy, he'll be swinging from a tree with a noose for a neckerchief if he touches a white woman in Montgomery. "
91,GRAHAM: What did you just say?. 
92,"ROSA: There a problem here, Mister Steele? (to Ryan) Step away now. Go ahead, step away. "
93,STEELE: These friends of yours? 
94,"ROSA: No, sir. Just on my lunch break, wondering if I can help out with any misunderstanding. Oh, I believe your suit will be ready tomorrow. "
95,"The alterations going to make it look just right, sir. "
96,"STEELE: Let's go, Lizzie. "
97,(The couple walk away.) 
98,ROSA: Are you crazy?  
99,RYAN: He slapped me. 
100,ROSA: Don't you read the newspapers? You know what they did to young Emmett Till. 
101,DOCTOR: We're from out of town. 
102,"ROSA: So was Emmett Till, on vacation from the north. Couple of words to a white woman in Mississippi, and the next thing, they find his body in the river. "
103,You want that to be you? 
104,RYAN: No. 
105,"ROSA: Did your mother raise you with no manners? I will take a 'no, ma'am'. "
106,"RYAN: No, ma'am. "
107,ROSA: You all together?  
108,"DOCTOR: Yes. We're very grateful, Miss... "
109,"ROSA: Mrs Parks, Rosa Parks. "
110,YASMIN: No way.  
111,GRAHAM: You're kidding. 
112,"DOCTOR: Brilliant. Rosa Parks. Lovely to meet you, Rosa Parks. Big fan. "
113,ROSA: Excuse me? 
114,DOCTOR: Big fan... of Montgomery. I am... we are just visiting. Recommend anything for tourists like us? 
115,ROSA: I recommend you get yourselves the hell out of Alabama before you find yourselves in trouble you can't get out of. 
116,(The Doctor scans Rosa as she walks away.) 
117,"YASMIN: Oh, my God, can you believe it? Actual Rosa Parks. "
118,DOCTOR: Amazing. Also a problem. Registering traces of artron energy all around her. Why is that? 
119,
120,[Alley]
121,
122,"(A man - think James Dean, Rebel Without a Cause, with a black jacket instead of red - scans the Tardis with a device that doesn't belong on 1955 Earth.) "
123,KRASKO: No. 
124,"(He bangs on the door, then fires an energy pulse from a second device at the Tardis. The outer shell wibbles.) "
125,KRASKO: Force shields.
126,
127,[Slim's Bar]
128,
129,"(Sitting round a table, attracting attention from both the white customers and black kitchen staff.) "
130,"YASMIN: We were in Rosa Parks class in primary. Do you remember? All the Year 4, 5 and 6 classes were named after inspirational people. "
131,"RYAN: She's the bus woman, right? "
132,YASMIN: You do remember what she did. 
133,"RYAN: Yeah, first black woman to ever drive a bus. "
134,"YASMIN: No, Ryan.  "
135,RYAN: What? 
136,GRAHAM: Your Nan would have a fit right now. How could you have been in a class named after the woman and not know who she is? 
137,RYAN: She's American. 
138,"YASMIN: She refused to give up her seat on a segregated bus to a white passenger, and got arrested for it. Her arrest started a boycott of the buses in Montgomery. "
139,"DOCTOR: Or rather, will start. Today is Wednesday, November 30th, 1955. Tomorrow, Rosa refuses to give up her seat.  "
140,"RYAN: And all this basically kicked off the US civil rights movement, led by Martin Luther King. See, I'm not totally ignorant. I just got confused by "
141,the whole bus thing. 
142,DOCTOR: Martin Luther King is a minister here in Montgomery right now. 
143,YASMIN: He and Rosa knew each other?  
144,DOCTOR: Yeah. 
145,"GRAHAM: Is it me, or has it gone very quiet in here? "
146,WAITRESS: We don't serve negroes. 
147,"RYAN: Good, cos I don't eat them. "
148,WAITRESS: Or Mexicans. 
149,YASMIN: Is she talking to me? 
150,WAITRESS: Y'all need to eat somewhere else. 
151,DOCTOR: Come on.
152,
153,[Street]
154,
155,"DOCTOR: Okay, listen. I can deal with this. You guys go back to the Tardis and be safe. "
156,YASMIN: While you do what?  
157,DOCTOR: Locate the source of these energy anomalies. We're one day out of a tipping point in Earth history. I don't want anything disrupting that. 
158,It's easy for me here. It's more dangerous for you. You can walk away from this. 
159,RYAN: Rosa Parks can't. 
160,YASMIN: Rosa Parks doesn't. 
161,"RYAN: If she can live her whole life, a couple of hours ain't going to kill me. It ain't going to kill me, right? "
162,GRAHAM: No. 
163,DOCTOR: Not if we look out for each other. 
164,"RYAN: I'm cool with it. What do you reckon, Mexican lady? "
165,"YASMIN: Oi. Keep that up, I'll use you as a pinata. "
166,DOCTOR: Epicentre of the artron readings is 1.2 miles that way. Come on. 
167,"GRAHAM: Hey, hey, we will stop somewhere else to eat, though, won't we? "
168,"DOCTOR: No time, Graham. "
169,"GRAHAM: Have you noticed that happens a lot? I need regular food, that's all. "
170,(The police are keeping an eye on the group.) 
171,RYAN: We just got thrown out of a bar and that's what you're worried about? 
172,GRAHAM: Not just that. 
173,"YASMIN: Not sure your stomach's compatible with time travel, Graham."
174,
175,[Street]
176,
177,(Rosa is confronted by our mystery leather-jacketed man.) 
178,ROSA: Can I help you? There a problem here? 
179,"KRASKO: No problem, ma'am. No problem at all."
180,
181,[Bus works]
182,
183,DOCTOR: This is where the artron signals converge. At the bus company. 
184,YASMIN: All roads lead to Rosa Parks. 
185,DOCTOR: Yeah. Bit of a worry. Let's have a look around. 
186,GRAHAM: I'm not sure about this. 
187,(The Doctor sonicks a row of padlocks open.)
188,
189,[Bus works shed]
190,
191,"(A large mostly empty area indoors, apart from a step ladder and a table with four chairs set for a meal. The Doctor has the Sheffield sonic working all the time.) "
192,RYAN: There's nothing in here. 
193,"DOCTOR: Why padlock an empty room, unless it's not empty. "
194,(A suitcase suddenly appears in front of them.) 
195,GRAHAM: That wasn't there a second ago. 
196,RYAN: No kidding. 
197,DOCTOR: It was there. We just couldn't see it. Perception filter. 
198,YASMIN: Why would anybody do that to a suitcase? 
199,(Initials GFB on it.) 
200,RYAN: Can we open it? 
201,DOCTOR: Is the right question. Is anyone excited? Cos I'm really excited. 
202,GRAHAM: You won't be if it's a bomb. 
203,"DOCTOR: Don't kill the vibe, Graham. "
204,(She opens the suitcase to reveal 5 gizmos.) 
205,"RYAN: Whoa, not very '50s. "
206,"DOCTOR: I knew it. See, now there's a problem. We're not the only ones in Montgomery who don't belong here.  "
207,YASMIN: Any clues what any of that is? 
208,"DOCTOR: Information brick, multi-intercept and surveillance device. All a bit knackered, though. "
209,"GRAHAM: Well, why has it been left in here? "
210,DOCTOR: (gasp) This explains the artron signals. This is very bad news. Secondary charger for a... 
211,"(An energy weapon blast flashes past them, vanishing a chair. Krasko has arrived.) "
212,DOCTOR: Run. 
213,(The stepladder vanishes when the energy beam hits it.)
214,
215,[Bus works yard]
216,
217,DOCTOR: Over here. 
218,(Krasko climbs to the top of a rusty oil or fuel tank to look around.) 
219,DOCTOR: (sotto) Stay here. 
220,(She gets onto the next tank.) 
221,"DOCTOR: Oi, Brando, looking for us? I'm not armed.  "
222,(Referencing the 1954 movie On The Waterfront.) 
223,KRASKO: Is that supposed to make me not shoot you? 
224,"DOCTOR: Ideally. So, temporal displacement weapon. Horrible things. Can't stand them.  "
225,KRASKO: Thank you.  
226,DOCTOR: Not a compliment. Takes a lot of power to displace things in Time. I think you and I both know your weapon's pretty much out of juice. 
227,And I've got your spare battery. You've been leaving traces of residual artron energy all over 1955. 
228,"KRASKO: And what are you, the Artron Police? Maybe you are. The blue box in the alley. Is it a Tardis?  "
229,DOCTOR: Might be. What's it to you? 
230,"KRASKO: Well, it could be worth a lot. "
231,"DOCTOR: Nah, not that one. Second hand, huge mileage, one careless owner. Mind you, it's better than a Vortex Manipulator, like the one on your wrist. "
232,Cheap and nasty time travel. 
233,"(Krasko fiddles with the thing on his right wrist, revealing a tattoo on the inside of his left wrist.) "
234,"DOCTOR: So, what do you want with Rosa Parks? "
235,KRASKO: Who? 
236,"DOCTOR: Oh, now you're being annoying. "
237,KRASKO: The feeling's mutual. 
238,DOCTOR: How long have you been here? 
239,KRASKO: Get out of Montgomery.  
240,DOCTOR: You're not the first to say that to us. 
241,"KRASKO: If I see any of you again, I will kill you. "
242,DOCTOR: Don't threaten me. 
243,"(We don't see who blinked first, but back on the ground.) "
244,"KRASKO: Chop, chop, on your way now. "
245,(She gives his weapon a quick sonic scan.) 
246,KRASKO: What are you doing? 
247,"DOCTOR: Come on, gang. "
248,YASMIN: Are we actually leaving? 
249,DOCTOR: Not in a million years.
250,
251,[Sahara Springs Motel]
252,
253,(Whites only.) 
254,RYAN: I'm getting pretty sick of seeing that sign. 
255,"YASMIN: So, how are we going to do this?"
256,
257,[Motel room]
258,
259,(Ryan gets helped in through the bathroom window.) 
260,"GRAHAM: In you come, before anyone sees. "
261,"RYAN: Well, this is fun. "
262,YASMIN: Last time I sneaked into someone's room by a window was Danny Biswas in Year 10. 
263,RYAN: You just went right down in my estimation. 
264,YASMIN: All right. 
265,RYAN: Danny Biswas? He was punching well above his weight. 
266,YASMIN: Did you just accidentally pay me a compliment? 
267,RYAN: Whatever. 
268,GRAHAM: Why can't we just stay in the Tardis? 
269,"DOCTOR: Our friend with the temporal displacement weapon's got eyes on it. We go in and out of there, we're going to run into him again and I don't want to just yet. "
270,Not till we've figured this out. 
271,RYAN: And this is better? Smuggling ourselves into crummy motels? 
272,DOCTOR: I just need a moment to work this out. 
273,"YASMIN: Yeah, like, what do we actually know? "
274,"GRAHAM: Well, 1955, Montgomery, one day away from Rosa Parks refusing to give her seat up on a bus. "
275,"DOCTOR: Meanwhile, we've got an out-of-time impostor skulking at the bus works with a temporal displacement weapon. "
276,"RYAN: I understand weapon, but not sure about temporal or displacement. "
277,"DOCTOR: Displaces you through Time. A blast hits you, you're thrown through Time to wherever the user has set it. He had it set for the very far future. "
278,RYAN: That's horrible.  
279,"DOCTOR: Yes. And it uses artron molecules. That, plus his Vortex Manipulator were presumably what the Tardis detected when it brought us here. "
280,"YASMIN: So do we think he's trying to kill Rosa Parks, or use that weapon on her? "
281,"DOCTOR: He's been here a while. He set up base at the bus works. If he wanted to get rid of her, why has he not done it already? "
282,"Besides, the sonic picked up something else on him, but I'd need to go back to make sure. Right, what do you remember about Rosa from school? "
283,(The Doctor starts writing on the wall.) 
284,"GRAHAM: Oi, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?. That is vandalism. We'll have to pay for that. "
285,"DOCTOR: Don't worry, special pen. "
286,"GRAHAM: No, pack it in. You ain't Banksy. "
287,DOCTOR: Or am I? Rosa takes the bus on the 1st December 1955. What time of day? 
288,"YASMIN: Evening. She was coming home from work. I remember cos she said people thought she didn't stand cos she was tired from working, but she wasn't. "
289,DOCTOR: Where did she work? 
290,"YASMIN: I think it was in a shop, like a department store. "
291,"GRAHAM: No, no, wait. Earlier she told that git that slapped Ryan his suit'd be ready tomorrow.  "
292,"YASMIN: That's it. She did clothes repairs. She was a seamstress. I mean, is a seamstress. Can't get used to being in the past. "
293,(Banging on door.) 
294,YASMIN: Bathroom.  
295,RYAN: Seriously? 
296,YASMIN: Very seriously. 
297,(Ryan and Yasmin hide in the bathroom.) 
298,"GRAHAM: No, Doc. The wall. "
299,(She sonicks it clean.) 
300,DOCTOR: Banksy doesn't have one of those. Or have I? 
301,(She opens the door.) 
302,"DOCTOR: Oh, officer. What can I do for you? "
303,"MASON: Can I come in, ma'am? "
304,"DOCTOR: Ma'am. Still can't get used to that. Here we are, darling. This police officer was so keen to come in he didn't feel the need to introduce himself. "
305,"GRAHAM: Is there a problem, Officer...? "
306,MASON: Mason. Montgomery Police. 
307,"DOCTOR: I'd offer you a cuppa, but the refreshment facilities are very poor. I'll be leaving a note. "
308,MASON: British? 
309,GRAHAM: How can you tell? 
310,MASON: You've been making folks uneasy. 
311,DOCTOR: How've we done that? 
312,"MASON: Y'all happen to know a couple of... mongrels, hmm? Negro boy, Mexican girl? "
313,DOCTOR: I don't recognise anyone by that description. 
314,"MASON: Huh. See, the er, negro's been going around picking fights with upstanding citizens. Now, you appreciate it's er, an offence to harbour coloureds in a room here. "
315,DOCTOR: We're not harbouring anyone who doesn't have a right to be here. 
316,MASON: Mmm-hmm. What's your business here in Montgomery? 
317,(He moves the Doctor away from the bathroom door.) 
318,"GRAHAM: We're here to, er, pitch an invention. Yeah, er, it's a telephone... that plays music, and it's a camera also, takes photo... and it's a calendar. "
319,And it send letters. 
320,MASON: Sounds ridiculous.  
321,"GRAHAM: Yeah, I know. "
322,"MASON: What's your name, sir? "
323,GRAHAM: Steve... Jobs. Steve Jobs. 
324,"MASON: You being disrespectful with me, Mister Jobs? "
325,"GRAHAM: Steve Jobs would never disrespect a Montgomery police officer, sir. "
326,MASON: Uh-huh. 
327,(Mason bursts into the bathroom. It's empty with the window open. He looks outside. Nothing.) 
328,"MASON: Hmm. You get yourselves gone as soon as your, er, business is concluded, mmm-hmm? "
329,(Officer Mason leaves.) 
330,DOCTOR: I did not warm to him. 
331,
332,[Behind the motel dumpsters]
333,
334,RYAN: I'm sick of this place already. 
335,YASMIN: I know. But to be here just as history's taking place. 
336,"RYAN: This ain't history here, Yaz. We're hiding behind bins. I'm having to work so hard to keep my temper, every second here. "
337,I could've slapped that guy back there as soon as we arrived. Thank God me Nan taught me how to keep my temper. Never give them the excuse. 
338,YASMIN: Yeah? My dad tells me the same. 
339,"RYAN: Yeah, see? It's not like Rosa Parks wipes out racism from the world forever. Otherwise, how come I get stopped way more by the police than my white mates? "
340,"YASMIN: Oi, not this police. "
341,RYAN: Tell me you don't get hassle. 
342,"YASMIN: Course I do, especially on the job. I get called a Paki when I'm sorting out a domestic, or a terrorist on the way home from the mosque. "
343,"RYAN: Yeah, exactly. "
344,"YASMIN: But they don't win, those people. I can be a police officer now cos people like Rosa Parks fought those battles for me. For us. "
345,"And in 53 years, they'll have a black President as leader. Who knows where they'll be 50 years after that? But that's proper change. What? "
346,RYAN: Were you born this positive? 
347,YASMIN: Guess so. Must be my Mexican blood. 
348,GRAHAM: head out of bathroom window) Yaz. Ryan.
349,
350,[Motel room]
351,
352,(A wave of the Sheffield sonic restores the writing on the wall.) 
353,"DOCTOR: Where were we? We need as much intel as we can get. If we're going to protect Rosa, we need to know the facts of her life. "
354,"Home address, daily routine, where she works, the routes she takes, and the church she attends. Also, the name of the driver she refused. "
355,GRAHAM: I know that. It's James Blake. 
356,RYAN: How do you know that? 
357,"GRAHAM: Well, your Nan, when she found out I was a bus driver, said to me, you'd better not be like James Blake. Blake the snake, that's what she called him. "
358,And I had to ask her who he was and she just said he gave all bus drivers a bad name. 
359,YASMIN: She said that when you'd only just met?  
360,GRAHAM: Yeah. 
361,YASMIN: That's pretty hardline. 
362,RYAN: That's me Nan.  
363,"GRAHAM: Yeah. She had a T-shirt that said, er, The Spirit of Rosa, and er, well, I wish that she was here. "
364,RYAN: I don't. She'd start a riot. 
365,GRAHAM: Yeah.  
366,DOCTOR: Right. Operation Rosa Parks. 
367,"(Ryan collects bus timetables. Yasmin goes through telephone directories and newspapers, finding an advert for clothing repairs at Montgomery Fair "
368,"Department Store. Later, back at the motel.) "
369,YASMIN: I've found out where she works. Montgomery Fair Department Store. 
370,"RYAN: And if the phone book's right, this is where she lives. "
371,"GRAHAM: Right, so these bus routes don't go near Rosa's shop or house, but these ones do. "
372,"DOCTOR: Great. If we can find Rosa's route and time today, we can keep an eye on her tomorrow. Who's up for a bus ride? "
373,(Graham raises his hand.)
374,
375,[Bus]
376,
377,"GRAHAM: Excuse me. Sorry. Okay, Doc. This route is one of three that goes between Rosa's home and where she works. I reckon this one is the most direct. "
378,DOCTOR: So it's most likely she takes this one tomorrow night. But we can't be certain exactly what time. 
379,"(Yasmin doesn't know where to sit, White or Colored.) "
380,YASMIN: Unless we stalk her all day. 
381,(Ryan gets on through the rear door.) 
382,"RYAN: This is me, on the back of the bus. "
383,GRAHAM: (sotto) I'm so ashamed. (normal) You shouldn't have to do this.

385,YASMIN: The driver let me on at the front of the bus. What does that mean for where I sit? Obviously not a lot of Pakistani heritage around here.

398,"YASMIN: Hi. Nice to see you again. Mrs Parks, right?  "
399,ROSA: Yes. 
400,DOCTOR: You helped us out earlier today with our little misunderstanding. 
401,ROSA: I remember. British.  
402,"DOCTOR: Yes. Funny thing, you'll never believe this, we're actually doing market research for bus companies. Looking at people's transport habits. "
403,"Answer the questions, enter the raffle for a prize. You get this bus this time every day? "
404,ROSA: Most days. Always this time. 
405,DOCTOR: And you live...? 
406,"ROSA: Cleveland Court. Next stop. Ma'am, if you keep sitting there, we're all going to have to move. "
407,GRAHAM: What do you mean? 
408,"ROSA: If white folks need seats, by law, I have to give mine up. This middle section is only for coloureds if white folk don't need it. "
409,"GRAHAM: Well, that's not right. "
410,(The Doctor moves to an empty white seat.) 
411,"ROSA: Tell your company that, sir. If I win your raffle, will that give me the right to sit anywhere I want on this bus? "
412,DOCTOR: No. 
413,ROSA: I didn't think so. This is my stop. 
414,(Rosa leaves by the rear door.) 
415,RYAN: I'm going to follow her. See what I can find out. Meet you back at the motel later.

417,RYAN: Yeah. 
418,(Leaves the bus.) 
419,YASMIN: Do you think he'll be all right? 
420,"DOCTOR: I hope so. Graham, do you think you can find James Blake, the driver? "
421,"GRAHAM: Er, yeah. I'll just have a talk with the bloke at the front and find out where they all drink. "
422,"DOCTOR: Yaz, can you compile a timeline of what happens this time tomorrow evening? "
423,YASMIN: Okay. What are you going to do?

432,RYAN: The fight. 
433,"ROSA: And how do I know you're not a spy for the police, or the FBI? "
434,"RYAN: Cos if they were going to send a spy, they'd send one who could actually follow you without being spotted. And didn't have a British accent. "

442,"DOCTOR: Whoops. Shame, you just sent all your equipment to goodness knows where. 79th century, judging by the weapon setting, which, by the way, overheat very easily. "
443,(Krasko drops the hot weapon with a grunt.) 
444,DOCTOR: Cheap and nasty. Now we're even. First things first. Tell me about Stormcage. 
445,KRASKO: Storm what? 
446,"DOCTOR: Oh, rubbish liar. On your wrist. It's a Stormcage identifier. The most secure prison facility this side of the universe. Not in this time-zone, of course, "
447,but I guess that's where the Vortex Manipulator comes in. 
448,KRASKO: It's amazing what you can get if you're prepared to work and barter inside that prison.  
449,DOCTOR: Escape or release? 
450,KRASKO: I did my time. I'm rehabilitated. 
451,DOCTOR: What were you there for in the first place? 
452,"KRASKO: If I tell you, it might colour your view of me. I was young. Nobody got hurt. Well, a few people got killed. A few hundred people. A thousand, tops. "
453,Two thousand. 
454,DOCTOR: And it was nasty enough that Stormcage placed a neural restrictor in your brain before releasing you back into the universe. 
455,KRASKO: How can you know that? Who are you? 
456,"DOCTOR: Very good scanner, this. I thought I detected it the first time we met, and then it started to make sense, cos we were wondering, "
457,"you've obviously got a problem with Rosa, why don't you just kill her? But the answer is, because you can't. Neural restrictor means you can't kill or injure any living thing. "
458,"It stops you from doing it, no matter how much you want to try. So even if I do this... (grabs the Vortex manipulator from his wrist, drops "
459,it on the concrete floor and stomps on it) smash your Vortex Manipulator...

463,"DOCTOR: You can't harm me, as much as you want to. Better be nice to me, cos I'm your best chance of getting out of this time-zone now. Neutered criminal on release, "
464,and you come here. Why? 
465,KRASKO: I'm allowed a hobby. 
466,DOCTOR: And yours is Rosa Parks? 
467,KRASKO: This is where things started to go wrong. 
468,DOCTOR: And you think you can put them right? 
469,"KRASKO: I had a lot of time to think in Stormcage, and I realised tiny actions change the world. "
470,DOCTOR: What's your name? 
471,KRASKO: Krasko. 
472,"DOCTOR: Don't like it. Listen, Krasko, I'll give you one warning. Go somewhere else, find a beach, read a book, cos you're a criminal who's lost his kit, lost his weapons. "
473,KRASKO: You think that makes a difference? History changes when tiny things don't go to plan. 
474,"DOCTOR: You mean tomorrow. Won't work, not while I'm here. "

528,"GRAHAM: That's what I said. Strangely, he didn't listen. Your mate is interfering. He's reassigned Blake's route to a driver called Elias Griffin Junior. "
529,"DOCTOR: Tiny actions, that's what Krasko's doing. See, he's clever, I'll give him that. He knows. He's not planning on killing, or destroying or breaking history. "
530,"He's planning to nudge it just enough so that it doesn't happen. Enough of a stick in the spokes to throw everything off the rails, and now I am really mixing "
531,"my transport metaphors. Well, he didn't reckon with us keeping it in place. "
532,"YASMIN: And how do we do that, then? "
533,"DOCTOR: Now we know what our task is. Keep history in order. No changing it, just guarding it against someone who wants to disrupt it. "
534,"Tomorrow, we have to make sure Rosa Parks gets on the bus driven by James Blake. And that the bus is full, so Rosa sits when she's asked to stand for white passengers. "
