23, Episode One
24,
25, [Beach]
26,
27,"(The Tardis materialises amidst the dunes by a golden beach, played by Climping beach, Littlehampton, West Sussex.) "
28,"JAMIE: Where are we, Doctor? "
29,"DOCTOR: We're by the seaside, that's where we are. That's all that"
30,matters. 
31,"JAMIE: Aye, but where? "
32,"VICTORIA: Yes, Doctor, we must know. "
33,"DOCTOR: Oh, stop fussing, you two. Come on. "
34,(The Doctor runs down the slope to the beach.) 
35,"DOCTOR: Come on, you two. No, wait a minute. See if there's any buckets"
36,and spades in the Tardis. 
37,JAMIE: Buckets and spades? Is he going to dig for worms? 
38,"VICTORIA: No, he wants us to play sand castles. "
39,"JAMIE: Sand castles? What does he think we are, a couple of children? "
40,"(The Doctor runs along the sand, then notices a hovercraft moored further"
41,along the shore and waves at it.)
42,
43,[By the hovercraft]
44,
45,(The man is Australian.) 
46,"ANTON: Hey, Rod, pass me those binoculars. (Rod opens the hatch of the hovercraft.)"
47,ROD: Now what's biting you? 
48,ANTON: Some crazy nut dancing a jig. 
49,(He looks through the binoculars. A third man with curly hair stands up in the hovercraft.) 
50,"ANTON: Hey, wait a minute. It can't be. Get below fast, both of you. "
51,ROD: What's the matter? 
52,ANTON: Move!
53,
54, [Beach]
55,
56,(The Doctor is down to his long-johns in the surf.)
57,
58,"DOCTOR: Come on in, the water's lovely. You don't know what you're"
59,missing. 
60,"VICTORIA: Doctor! You'll catch your death. (The Doctor plays in the water, and Jamie laughs.) "
61,[Hovercraft]
62,
63,"ROD: Well, what do you know? You're right, it is"
64,him. 
65,ANTON: What are we going to do? 
66,(Anton picks up a handset and sets the dial.) 
67, [Kent's office]
68,
69,ASTRID: (blonde woman) Yes? 
70,ANTON : This is Anton. 
71,ASTRID: Where are you? 
72,ANTON : Ten miles west of Cape Arid. Now listen. 
73,ASTRID: Wait a minute. (She calls up a map of the area on the wall screen.)ASTRIC: What are you doing there? 
74,[Hovercraft]
75,
76,"ANTON: What do you think we're doing, fishing? "
77,ASTRID : I shouldn't be surprised. 
78,ANTON: Oh yeah? Well this time we caught a whale. He's here! 
79,[Kent's office]
80,
81,"ASTRID: Well, that's physically impossible. "
82,ANTON : It's him all right. There's no shadow of doubt about it. 
83,"ASTRID: Oh no, you're making a mistake, you must be. "
84,[Hovercraft]
85,
86,"ANTON: Now listen, there are three of us here."
87,We've all had a look. 
88,[Kent's office]
89,
90,"ASTRID: Well, if you're that definite, I'll contact"
91,"Giles. [Hovercraft]ANTON: No! We'll take care of this ourselves. [Kent's office]ASTRID: Listen, Anton, you'll do nothing without Giles' agreement. "
92,ANTON : There isn't time! 
93,[Hovercraft]
94,
95,ASTRID : Make time. 
96,"ANTON: If you think I'm going to pass up a chance like this, you're"
97,crazy. 
98,[Kent's office]
99,
100,"ASTRID: Well, at least wait till I get there. "
101,(Transmission ends.) 
102,ASTRID: Anton! Anton! 
103,(But Anton is handing out guns.) 
104,"ASTRID: Giles, that's just what I said. How could it be him? "
105,"KENT : It's a mistake, it must be. "
106,"(Played by the BBC's resident Australian, Bill Kerr.) "
107,"ASTRID: Yes, I know, but he was definite. He's going to kill him. "
108,"KENT : I don't care. Get after them, stop them! "
109,"ASTRID: But Giles, what can I do? "
110,"KENT : Look, I don't care what you do, Astrid, but stop"
111,them!
112,
113, [Beach]
114,
115,(The Doctor has got dressed again.) 
116,"DOCTOR: Oh, there's nothing like a dip to freshen you up. "
117,"JAMIE: Hey, there's a funny looking boat. "
118,"DOCTOR: That's not a boat, it's a hovercraft. "
119,JAMIE: Eh? 
120,DOCTOR: It's a hovercraft. It floats on the air instead of the sea. 
121,"JAMIE: Oh, yes? Yeah, I'm too old for fairy tales. "
122,"DOCTOR: No, it's true, Jamie. "
123,VICTORIA: What a terrifying thing. It's like a sea monster. 
124,"JAMIE: Oh, we'll soon get a closer look. It's coming nearer. "
125,(The hovercraft is coming straight for them.) 
126,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Yes. I don't think I like the look of this. Let's go. "
127,VICTORIA: Why? What's the matter? 
128,"DOCTOR: Come on, run. "
129,JAMIE: But Doctor 
130,"DOCTOR: Don't argue, run. Come on. JAMIE: What do you mean, run?DOCTOR: Come on! "
131,"(Curly and Anton shoot at the travellers as they run for the sand dunes.) [Dunes]The Doctor, Jamie and Victoria"
132,hide in the grassy dunes.) 
133,JAMIE: If only we had a gun. 
134,VICTORIA: But why do they want to harm us? 
135,"DOCTOR: Why indeed? Well, what now? "
136,"VICTORIA: Look, Doctor, can't we go back to the Tardis? "
137,"DOCTOR: No, we'd never make it. There's not much cover here. "
138,VICTORIA: Perhaps we've landed in a world of mad men. 
139,"DOCTOR: They're human beings, if that's what you mean, indulging their"
140,favourite past time. Trying to destroy each other. 
141,"(The hovercraft stops at the base of the dunes, and the men disembark with their guns.) "
142,DOCTOR: Time we went. Come on. 
143,(The travellers sneak amongst the dunes. Anton sends Curly off to the
144,right whilst he and Rod go left. The travellers meet up with Curly.
145,Jamie knocks him out.) 
146,JAMIE: Creag an tuire! 
147,"VICTORIA: Oh, well done. "
148,(Anton and Rod see a helicopter coming in to land.) 
149,JAMIE: What's that? 
150,"ROD: I know those markings, that's Astrid's runabout. What's she doing"
151,here? 
152,ANTON: Interfering. We've got to get to him before she does. 
153,"(The Doctor, Jamie and Victoria run again. The helicopter lands. Astrid is flying"
154,it.) 
155,"JAMIE: What is it, Doctor? "
156,"VICTORIA: Oh, I'm frightened! "
157,ASTRID: Over here! Run! 
158,VICTORIA: I can't! I can't! 
159,DOCTOR: You must. It's our only chance. 
160,ASTRID: Hurry! 
161,DOCTOR: Come on! 
162,(The three get aboard as Anton and Rod come Funning. Rod stops to check on Curly.) 
163,ANTON: Leave him. 
164,(The helicopter takes off in a hail of bullets.)
165,
166, [Helicopter]
167,
168,DOCTOR: A very timely and welcome rescue. 
169,"ASTRID: Don't speak to me for a moment, please. (The"
170,Doctor looks at the permit posted in the back of the helicopter -
171,"Australasion (sic) Zone. Type Helicopter, (private). Valid until 31st"
172,Dec 2018. Class Reg No L23X. Victoria has her arms around Jamie's neck.)
173,"JAMIE: But what is this thing, Doctor? "
174,"DOCTOR: It's a helicopter, Jamie. "
175,JAMIE: Huh? 
176,"DOCTOR: A chopper. You know, a whirly bird. "
177,JAMIE: He say's it's a bird. 
178,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. It's a primitive form of flying machine. "
179,"VICTORIA: Well, at least we're safe now, aren't we? "
180,ASTRID: Depends on what you mean by been safe. They've shot a hole in
181,the fuel tank. We might blow up any minute. 
182,"(Rod gets Curly back to the hovercraft, then they head"
183,back onto the water and follow the helicopter as far as they can. Astrid
184,flies inland to a lone bungalow.)
185,"ASTRID: Here we go.(She lands the helicopter. They all get out, Astrid last of all, holding her left arm.) "
186, [Outside the bungalow]
187,
188,DOCTOR: Wait. You're hurt. 
189,ASTRID: It's nothing. We're lucky to be still alive. 
190,"DOCTOR: Jamie, give her a hand. "
191, [Astrid's living room]
192,
193,DOCTOR: Come along inside. 
194,ASTRID: I'm all right. 
195,"DOCTOR: Now let's have a look at it. You're not, and please don't"
196,argue. Victoria? Bring some warm water will you? 
197,"VICTORIA: Well, where's the kitchen? "
198,"ASTRID: Through the arch. There's a medical kit in the bathroom,"
199,through there. 
200,"DOCTOR: Go and fetch it, will you, Jamie? "
201,JAMIE: Right. 
202,DOCTOR: Come and sit down. 
203,ASTRID: It's nothing. It's just a scratch. 
204,"DOCTOR: We'll see. Oh, yes. ASTRID: Who are you? "
205,DOCTOR: You mean you don't know? 
206,"ASTRID: No, why should I? "
207,"DOCTOR: Well you went to such a great deal of trouble to save us. Ah,"
208,"there we are. Thank you, Jamie. "
209,ASTRID: Do you know how to use those things? 
210,"JAMIE: Oh, don't worry, the Doctor will fix you up just fine. "
211,VICTORIA : Jamie! 
212,"ASTRID: Oh, you're a doctor? "
213,"DOCTOR: Well, not of any medical significance. "
214,ASTRID: Doctor of law? Philosophy? 
215,"DOCTOR: Which law? Whose philosophies, eh? "
216,"ASTRID: Oh, I see. You're determined to be mysterious. "
217,DOCTOR: Am I? 
218,ASTRID: Doctor of science? 
219,DOCTOR: Septic spray. That should be right. 
220,"ASTRID: A Doctor of Divinity, then? "
221,"DOCTOR: You'll run out of doctors in a minute. Now, you haven't told us"
222,your name yet. 
223,ASTRID: Astrid Ferrier. 
224,"DOCTOR: Ah, Miss Ferrier, this is Victoria and this is Jamie. "
225,JAMIE: Hello. 
226,"DOCTOR: Now, this won't take a minute. I just want to clean it off. Be"
227,as gentle as I can. There we are. Who are these men? Why are they so
228,determined to kill us? 
229,ASTRID: Kill you. They hate you. 
230,DOCTOR: Me? I'm the nicest possible person. 
231,ASTRID: Or at least I should say they hate the person that they think
232,"you are, passionately and completely. "
233,VICTORIA: Can't we tell them they've made a mistake? 
234,ASTRID: There wouldn't be time. 
235,DOCTOR: They seem remarkably dedicated. 
236,ASTRID: They are. 
237,DOCTOR: There. 
238,(The Doctor finishes dressing her wound.) 
239,"DOCTOR: Tell me, Miss Ferrier, do you hate me? "
240,ASTRID: Far from it. To me you're the most wonderful and marvellous man
241,that's ever dropped out of the skies. Will you do something for me? 
242,"DOCTOR: Anything, anything at all. "
243,"ASTRID: It'll probably cost you your life. Oh, but it would be worth"
244,it. 
245,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's, that's comforting, anyway. What is it that you want me to"
246,do? 
247,"ASTRID: Let me take you to the man I work for, Giles Kent. He'll"
248,explain everything you want to know. 
249,"DOCTOR: I don't think so, Miss Ferrier. No, I'm sorry. "
250,"JAMIE: Can we not just listen, Doctor? There's no harm in that. "
251,DOCTOR: There's a great deal of harm in it. You don't suppose Miss
252,"Ferrier saved our skins for our sakes, do you? Now what is it you want"
253,us for? 
254,ASTRID: You resemble very closely a man who's determined to be dictator
255,of the world. A man who will stop at nothing. 
256,VICTORIA: A dictator? Like Napoleon? 
257,DOCTOR: Who is he? 
258,ASTRID: Salamander. 
259,DOCTOR: Salamander? 
260,ASTRID: I know it's surprising. Let me take you to Giles Kent. 
261,(The hovercraft arrives outside.) 
262,"VICTORIA: Oh, you're not going to agree? "
263,ASTRID: The back door! Hurry! 
264,DOCTOR: It's too late! 
265,ASTRID: In there! 
266,(They hide in another room as Rod comes in through the back door. As he comes through
267,"the arch to the living room, Astrid grabs him jumps out from behind the settee and throws him against"
268,the wall.) 
269,ASTRID: Run for it! 
270,JAMIE: Come on! 
271,"(Shots are fired through the window, killing Rod.) "
272,"JAMIE: Miss Ferrier, come on. "
273,(Anton and Curly come in through the front.) 
274,"CURLY: But I. He was framed against the window. I saw him, he was"
275,trying to get out! 
276,ANTON: No time now. They'll get away! 
277,CURLY: There they are! 
278,(Curly fires through the window.) 
279,ANTON: Wait! If we can get up in the air above them we can finish this.
280,Now let's get to that helicopter!
281,
282, [Outside the bungalow]
283,
284,"(The Doctor, Astrid, Victoria and Jamie hide in a"
285,"ditch, and watch Anton and Curly run to the helipad.) "
286,ASTRID: The helicopter.
287,"(It takes off, leaking fuel.) "
288,ASTRID: It'll blow up!
289,(And so it does.)
290,
291, [Kent's office]
292,
293,KENT: Incredible.(He walks around the Doctor.)KENT: Absolutely incredible. 
294,"DOCTOR: I'm not a specimen in a glass bowl, you know. "
295,KENT: I'm sorry. Do sit down. 
296,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. "
297,KENT: It's just so astonishing. You are Salamander? 
298,ASTRID: You see what I mean? 
299,"KENT: But surely you know how alike you are? After all, Salamander is a"
300,world figure. 
301,"DOCTOR: Well, my friends and I, we've been out of touch of civilisation"
302,"for a little while. We're visitors, so to speak. On ice, shall we say. "
303,KENT: I see. Where shall I start? 
304,"DOCTOR: At the beginning, please. We've been subjected to a number of"
305,attacks because I look like this Salamander of yours. 
306,KENT: I'm not surprised. I'll show you why. I have a video wire of
307,Salamander addressing the United Zones Conference on World Food. (Starting with stock footage of the United Nations building.)
308,"REPORTER : And meanwhile, over at the United Zones General"
309,"Assembly, from all over the world delegates were flocking in, eager to"
310,hear the latest report from Leader Salamander. 
311,"(A swarthy black-haired man stands at a dais, the spitting image of the"
312,Doctor apart from the side parting and suntan. He speaks with a Mexican
313,accent.) 
314,"SALAMANDER [on screen]: The progress, Mister President, of the Sun"
315,"Conservation establishment at Kanowa, in the Australasian Zone, is, I'm"
316,"delighted to report, highly satisfactory. But we cannot yet guarantee"
317,"good summer holidays for all. (laughter) However, we have now in orbit the Mark"
318,"Seven Sun Catcher, and already we have been able to concentrate the"
319,sun's rays into much needed areas. The great Canadian wheat plains are
320,"safe. And now, Mister President, Ukraine, the grain field of the"
321,"planet, that unfortunate area between Poltava and Kirovograd devastated"
322,by the elements two short years ago. What have I to say to you about
323,that? I can tell you that on both banks of the Dnieper River the corn
324,is ripening in the sun! And ten-thousand robot harvesters are moving
325,down to gather in fifty million tons of flour! 
326,VICTORIA: There's nothing there to say he's a bad man. 
327,"DOCTOR: I quite agree, Victoria. He seems to be a public benefactor."
328,"Quite a speaker too and remarkably handsome, didn't you think so Jamie?"
329,
330,KENT: He's one of the most popular men on the planet. Many people call
331,"him the shopkeeper of the world. The saviour, in fact, some of them. "
332,"JAMIE: Well, what's he saved the world from? "
333,"ASTRID: Starvation. Too many people, too little food. "
334,KENT: Until Salamander invented his Sun Store. But surely you've heard?
335,You must know? 
336,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, well of course, we've heard something. "
337,KENT: The Sun Store collects the rays from the sun and stores them in
338,concentrated form. 
339,"JAMIE: Oh, like the ioniser, Doctor. "
340,"DOCTOR: Yes, a rather different principle, I think, Jamie, but "
341,"VICTORIA: Well, never mind how it works. What's it for? "
342,"KENT: Salamander can force-grow three, sometimes four, crops in one"
343,summer. 
344,"JAMIE: Well, why do these men want to kill him? I mean, one minute you"
345,"say he's saving the world, the next "
346,"KENT: For his own ends. Step by step, he's taking control of this"
347,planet. 
348,DOCTOR: You have proof of this? 
349,"KENT: Some, yes. I was once a high official in the World Zone"
350,"Authority. Deputy Security Leader for North Africa and Europe, but"
351,Salamander discredited and ruined me because he realised I was
352,beginning to get suspicious. 
353,DOCTOR: But you could be making up stories about Salamander out of
354,revenge. 
355,"KENT: Yes, I suppose so. Then you can judge for yourself. (Kent puts another video wire into his machine.)KENT: You remember"
356,Michael Assevski? He was Controller of the Eastern European Zone. He
357,was drowned at sea a mile from shore. 
358,(A series of pictures come up on the screen.) 
359,"KENT: Hockingham, murdered. All of them were seen with Salamander, or a"
360,"man known as his deputy, shortly before their deaths. "
361,ASTRID: All of them were replaced by men known to be in Salamander's
362,power. 
363,DOCTOR: Known by who? 
364,"KENT: By me, Doctor. "
365,"DOCTOR: Well, why don't you tell the authorities, the police or"
366,whatever? 
367,"KENT: Because I'm discredited, don't you see? Because Salamander is so"
368,"popular and also because the man that took my place, a man named Donald"
369,"Bruce, has since risen to become overall Security Chief. "
370,DOCTOR: Surely there is someone you can take your story to? 
371,"KENT: Oh, yes. Elvick believed me. So did Assevski. And they're dead."
372,"However there is one other man, a man named Alexander Denes, (pronounced Denesh) but none"
373,of them will do anything until it's too late. 
374,"VICTORIA: I'm surprised. Well, if Salamander is everything you say he"
375,"is, then why hasn't he tried to "
376,KENT: Dispose of me? 
377,VICTORIA: Yes. 
378,"KENT: Well, he has, but he's afraid. You see, the testimony of a dead"
379,man still holds legal weight. 
380,"DOCTOR: Oh, I see. Well, it seems we have a problem on our hands"
381,whether to believe Mister Kent or not. 
382,"KENT: Well, there is one way that you can find out for yourselves. "
383,"DOCTOR: Oh, how? "
384,ASTRID: Impersonate Salamander. 
385,"DOCTOR: Yes, I thought that's what we were leading up to. "
386,"JAMIE: Well, I must admit, Doctor, you do look like him. "
387,VICTORIA: Exactly like him. 
388,"DOCTOR: Yes, there's more to it than that. What about the voice? "
389,"ASTRID: Well, it's nearly the same pitch. Only the accent "
390,"DOCTOR: Only the accent? My dear young lady. Oh, dear. Now, what was it"
391,he said. (tries an imitation) We still cannot guarantee good summer
392,"holidays for all. No. Guarantee. No, no. Guaran. Guarantee. You see,"
393,"it's very difficult. Of course, I always was interested in phonetics."
394,Holidays. Summer. Summer. He must have come from Mexico. Quintana Roo
395,or Yucatan I shouldn't wonder. 
396,"KENT: That's incredible, Doctor. He was born at Merida, state capital"
397,of Yucatan. 
398,"DOCTOR: Yes, there are other very strong influences though. Oh, I could"
399,do it in time. But what if I did? What then? 
400,"KENT: You could walk into Salamander's Research Station at Kanowa, find"
401,out how he's getting control of the separate World Zones and then bring
402,out absolute proof. 
403,(The phone buzzes. Kent listens.) 
404,KENT: Yes. I see. How long did you say it would take you to master
405,Salamander's accent? 
406,"DOCTOR: I didn't. It would take three weeks, perhaps four. "
407,"KENT: Well, while we've been talking the Security Chief I told you"
408,"about, Donald Bruce, has since cordoned off this entire area. He's"
409,"coming here himself, now! I'd say you've got about two minutes, Doctor."
410,
411,DOCTOR: But that's out of the question! 
412,"KENT: You know what he'll do as soon as he sees you, a man who"
413,resembles Salamander so closely? 
414,"VICTORIA: Oh, that's not fair! "
415,KENT: Will you please listen! You'll be under arrest for impersonation
416,as soon as he sees you. I mean it. 
417,DOCTOR: But isn't there another way out of this? 
418,KENT: Only one. Be Salamander. 
419,VICTORIA: But the clothes! 
420,DOCTOR: Yes. 
421,"KENT: Yes, there are some in here. "
422,(Kent opens an inner office door.) 
423,"KENT: A little less eccentric, but do the best you can. "
424,DOCTOR: I won't! I can't! 
425,"KENT: Your friends, Doctor, do you want them to suffer? Because they"
426,"will, you know. "
427,"DOCTOR: No, no, wait a minute! Why is a man like Bruce coming here? Don't push me."
428,KENT: There isn't time. 
429,"DOCTOR: You sent for him, didn't you? You tipped him off! "
430,"KENT: I couldn't miss an opportunity like this. Now please, come on. "
431,(Kent pushes the Doctor into the inner office.) 
432,"ASTRID: Giles, for heaven's sake, what have you done? It's far too"
433,risky. 
434,"(A security guard with a gun opens the door and stands outside. A tall, heavy man walks past him.)"
435,
436,"BRUCE: Hello, Kent. Doing some recruiting, are you? A bit young for"
437,"killers, aren't they? "
438,VICTORIA: What do you mean? 
439,"KENT: All right, what do you mean by stepping in here like this? "
440,"BRUCE: Any time, Kent. I've got the right and you know it. Any time I"
441,like. 
442,"KENT: All right, what do you want? "
443,"BRUCE: That's better. You're ex-security, you know the way it's got to"
444,"go. We might as well be nice and civil about it, mightn't we? That"
445,"bungalow in Cedar District. In your name, right? "
446,ASTRID: Why? 
447,BRUCE: Do I have to tell you? There's been an awful nasty mess out
448,there. Someone has got himself shot in your living room. And who are
449,you two? 
450,JAMIE: Jamie McCrimmon. 
451,BRUCE: And? 
452,JAMIE: Victoria Waterfield. 
453,"BRUCE: What's the matter, can't you speak? "
454,VICTORIA: Don't shout at me. 
455,"BRUCE: Oh, very good. The outraged public citizen. Do they know who I"
456,am? 
457,"KENT: Yes, they do. "
458,"BRUCE: A pity. I like to hear you say it. Now listen to this, all of"
459,you. One of your men was murdered in a bungalow rented to you. The
460,remains of two others were found in what was left of a helicopter. You
461,were in that bungalow at the time and there were three other people
462,"with you. Two youngsters and a man, right? Now, there was another man,"
463,wasn't there? So we'll deal with that first. Where is he? 
464,"(Bruce gestures to the guard, who opens the inner office door. The Doctor comes out in a black roll"
465,"neck pullover, his hair combed into a side parting.) "
466,"DOCTOR: (mexican) Why, hello, Bruce. What are you doing here, huh? "
467, Episode Two
468,
469, [Kent's office]
470,
471,BRUCE: I was under the impression you were in the
472,"Central European Zone, Leader. "
473,DOCTOR: (mexican) That's what you were meant to believe. 
474,BRUCE: Why? 
475,DOCTOR: I do not care to be questioned by my own security.
476,BRUCE: But that's just it. How can I possibly maintain security when
477,you behave like this? I'm at least entitled to know your movements. 
478,"DOCTOR: You have a policeman's mind, Bruce. "
479,"BRUCE: That may be, but only a few days ago you questioned me about"
480,"this man and his activities, and we agreed that he was dangerous. Now I"
481,find you in his office. 
482,DOCTOR: Sometimes I like to deal with matters in my own way. 
483,BRUCE: They're not holding you here? 
484,DOCTOR: Holding me? 
485,BRUCE: Under some threat or other? 
486,DOCTOR: No one threatens Salamander. 
487,"BRUCE: I still think I deserve an explanation, Leader. "
488,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. You shall have it. But not now. When I return"
489,from the Central European Zone. 
490,"BRUCE: Very well. Now, what about the dead man found in your bungalow."
491,"He was one of your lot, wasn't he?"
492,"ASTRID: Yes. Er, he was trying to protect me. The other two wanted to kill"
493,me. 
494,BRUCE: Now why should they want to do that to a nice young girl like
495,you? 
496,ASTRID: Well I 
497,KENT: Obviously they thought I was there. 
498,BRUCE: You? 
499,"KENT: Yes, Bruce. Just like you a lot of people don't like me. "
500,"BRUCE: Don't get clever with me, Kent. I've a good mind to "
501,DOCTOR: I am prepared to accept his story. 
502,"BRUCE: Well, I'm not. "
503,"DOCTOR: That's interesting, but not important. I accept it, that's all"
504,that matters. 
505,BRUCE: It's beginning to look as if these people are working for you
506,now. Is that right? 
507,DOCTOR: You still dare to question me? They have information. I shall
508,get it. I will see you on my return. Now leave me. 
509,"BRUCE: McCrimmon, you said? "
510,JAMIE: Aye. 
511,"BRUCE: Well, you just watch your step, that's all. "
512,(Bruce and his guard leave.) 
513,JAMIE: I never said a word. 
514,"DOCTOR: (normal) Must be the way you look, Jamie. "
515,"VICTORIA: You were splendid, Doctor. "
516,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
517,ASTRID: That was a dangerous game to play. 
518,"KENT: It paid off. All right, are you with us? "
519,"DOCTOR: I don't know where you stand, Mister Kent, but you and this"
520,Salamander are obviously on opposite sides. That at least is clear. But
521,which side is good? Which side is bad? And why should I interfere? 
522,"ASTRID: Well, you're the only man who can help save the world. "
523,VICTORIA: But isn't that what Salamander's trying to do? 
524,ASTRID: Don't you understand? Salamander 
525,"DOCTOR: Just a moment. Jamie, you're unusually quiet. What do you"
526,think? 
527,"JAMIE: Well, to save the world, aye, well, it sounds grand, but. Oh, we"
528,"couldn't turn our back on a chance like this, Doctor. Well, at least I"
529,know you wouldn't. 
530,VICTORIA: We don't know anything about these people. 
531,JAMIE: Astrid saved our lives. She was wounded because of it. 
532,"VICTORIA: Oh, but Jamie, you don't think "
533,"JAMIE: Look, she was "
534,"KENT: Look, we're right about Salamander. It won't take you long to"
535,find out for yourselves. 
536,DOCTOR: How do you propose we do that? 
537,JAMIE: He'll be well guarded for a start. 
538,VICTORIA: We can hardly steal into his study and go through his papers.
539,
540,DOCTOR: That man Bruce said that he was in the Central European Zone.
541,
542,VICTORIA: It's a long way from Australia. 
543,ASTRID: It's only two hours by rocket. 
544,KENT: You could leave almost at once. 
545,"DOCTOR: Well, what then? "
546,ASTRID: I've had a plan for infiltrating into Salamander's inner circle
547,"for some time. Well, I could adapt it for your two friends. "
548,KENT: I can arrange three travel warrants and visas. Everything you
549,need. 
550,JAMIE: Just three? 
551,"KENT: Well one for Astrid, one for you and "
552,VICTORIA: Victoria. 
553,KENT: Of course. 
554,DOCTOR: Oh that's very clever of you. How can you do that? I thought
555,you said you had no official position.
556,ASTRID: We have a contact there. 
557,DOCTOR: He must be a very important person. 
558,"ASTRID: He is. Denes, Controller of the Zone. "
559,"DOCTOR: Oh, I see. What about me? "
560,KENT: I think we better have a look at Salamander's Research Station at
561,Kanowa. 
562,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, but from a safe distance, of course."
563,
564, [Benik's office]
565,
566,(The Kanowa
567,Research Station is a cluster of low
568,"buildings inside a perimeter fence, played by Dungeness Power Station"
569,in Kent. Entry forbidden except with Planetary Pass. A thin faced man
570,enters.) 
571,BENIK: What is all this? I'll just give you a couple of minutes. I have
572,a meeting. 
573,"BRUCE: This is important, Benik. "
574,BENIK: I hope so. Well? 
575,BRUCE: Salamander's left you in control of the Research Station? 
576,BENIK: Yes. 
577,BRUCE: Did he go on the rocket for the Central European Zone? 
578,BENIK: Yes. 
579,BRUCE: Did you see him go aboard? 
580,"BENIK: Hasn't been an accident, has there? "
581,BRUCE: Did you see the rocket take off? 
582,BENIK: Do you mean did I stand there waving my handkerchief? Hardly. I
583,had too much to do. 
584,"BRUCE: You're not a very funny man, Benik. Not to me. Now answer me!"
585,Did you actually see him leave? 
586,BENIK: What is all this? 
587,"BRUCE: I've just driven straight here from having spoken to Salamander,"
588,not two hundred miles away. 
589,BENIK: That's impossible. 
590,"BRUCE: I don't lie, even to someone like you. He was with Giles Kent. "
591,BENIK: But he hates Kent. 
592,BRUCE: Exactly. 
593,"BENIK: Kent wasn't holding him by force, was he? "
594,"BRUCE: No, I thought of that. Salamander was a wee bit odd, I admit."
595,"Not quite his usual self, but he was perfectly in control. All he had"
596,to do was bat an eyelid and I'd have knocked off everyone in sight. 
597,"BENIK: Oh well, I don't understand it. "
598,"BRUCE: Now, Salamander suggested that he was on his way to the Central"
599,European Zone. Now you're in radio contact with him. I want you to talk
600,"to him, make sure that Kent hasn't got some hold over him that we don't"
601,know about. 
602,BENIK: He instructed me not to bother him until the conference was
603,over. 
604,"BRUCE: Well, I'm countermanding that instruction. "
605,"BENIK: I'm telling you, Bruce, he won't answer. Not till the conference"
606,is over. It's too important. 
607,BRUCE: How long will it last? 
608,"BENIK: How should I know? They last three hours, usually. "
609,"BRUCE: All right, that'll have to do. Let me have a report as soon as"
610,you've spoken to him. Is that clear? Is that clear? 
611,BENIK: Yes. 
612,"(Bruce leave, slamming the door. Benik picks up a handset.) "
613,"BENIK: I want a direct channel link to Leader Salamander, Ariel TLXKZ."
614,Notify me as soon as he is able to accept transmission. That's all.

617,
618,"(In the Central European Zone, Salamander is"
619,sitting at a table with two colleagues.) 
620,"DENES: (East European) This is dreadful news, Salamander. I still can't"
621,believe it. 
622,"FEDORIN: Terrible, terrible. "
623,SALAMANDER: I don't say it will happen. I say it can happen. Your zone
624,"is in danger, Denes. Here, here and here.(He points at a map on the table.) "
625,FEDORIN: We've had no trouble for years in those mountains. 
626,SALAMANDER: You don't imagine I make it up? 
627,"FEDORIN: No, no, of course not. "
628,DENES: Those volcanoes have been dead since sixteenth century. Fedorin
629,is right to doubt. 
630,(The intercom buzzes.) 
631,"SALAMANDER: A volcano is a strange thing, my friend. I tell you the"
632,"truth. It's like a man in the hot sun, sleeping. Still, lifeless. Then"
633,boom! He wakes full of energy! I know volcanoes. 
634,DENES: Isn't there a possibility of a miscalculation for a few degrees?
635,
636,SALAMANDER: I'm never wrong. Every one of my predictions has been
637,accurate. 
638,DENES: Yes. Your record is good. I don't deny that. 
639,SALAMANDER: You are too kind. Now will you listen to me? 
640,(The buzzing continues. An African woman in a white mini-dress enters.) 
641,"FARIAH: Leader, the communications "
642,SALAMANDER: I know! I know! I told you I was not to be disturbed. 
643,"FARIAH: Yes, Leader. "
644,"SALAMANDER: No, wait! No, wait Fariah, huh? You'd like some refreshment,"
645,perhaps? 
646,FEDORIN: Thank you. 
647,"DENES: No, no, not for me. "
648,"SALAMANDER: Oh, you're going so soon? "
649,DENES: I must consult my scientific advisors. 
650,SALAMANDER: You still don't believe me. 
651,DENES: I believe you sufficiently to want to have your information
652,checked before I alarm my people unnecessarily. 
653,SALAMANDER: Your scientists won't help you. They don't know. They are
654,amateurs. 
655,"DENES: No, Salamander, they are not amateurs. They are very clever men"
656,"dedicated to their work, but they are men, capable of human error like"
657,anybody else. 
658,SALAMANDER: Do what you wish. Captain! 
659,(A guard enters.) 
660,CAPTAIN: Sir! 
661,SALAMANDER: Controller Denes is leaving. 
662,"CAPTAIN: Yes, sir. "
663,"SALAMANDER: You will soon see that I am right. (to Fedorin) Oh, you"
664,"will stay, huh? Have a drink. We have a great deal to talk about, you"

671,They have suitcases with them.) 
672,JAMIE: Are you sure this is the right one? 
673,VICTORIA: I'm not sure of anything after that rocket. But Astrid said
674,"it was the third bench on the south walk of the large gardens. Well,"
675,"here it is, I counted. "
676,JAMIE: Here we are. 
677,(Astrid arrives.) 
678,ASTRID: It's all arranged. Salamander's in residence in the President's
679,Palace. 
680,JAMIE: What's the card? 
681,ASTRID: That'll get you through the front gate. Find the terrace facing
682,west. 
683,"VICTORIA: Good luck, Jamie. "
684,"ASTRID: Yes, keep your wits about you. "
685,JAMIE: Right. 
686,(Jamie leaves. Astrid uses a communicator behind the bushes.) 
687,"ASTRID: Hello. Hello? Australasian Zone? How much longer? Look, don't"

695,"KENT: Right, let's have it. What's happening? "
696,ASTRID : Everything's gone fine so far. 
697,KENT: Speak up. We can't hear you very well.

707,"KENT: Right, how is the plan working so far? "
708,
709,[Public gardens]

712,"time in Hungary, and Jamie's got his entrance pass and has started"
713,phase one. 
714,KENT : Do you think the boy can handle it? 
715,"ASTRID: Well I hope so. My goodness, they're a pretty odd lot though,"

756,FARIAH: No. 
757,FEDORIN: Why not? 
758,FARIAH: I have never sat out here. 
759,FEDORIN: Salamander won't mind. 
760,FARIAH: I would never sit down here. 
761,"FEDORIN: If you don't like him, why do you work for him? "
762,FARIAH: He has a way of persuading people. 
763,"FEDORIN: Yes, I can imagine that. "
764,FARIAH: Brujo.(Spanish for sorcerer or witch doctor.) 
765,FEDORIN: What? If only I knew what he wanted to talk to me about. Would
766,you know? 
767,FARIAH: Salamander talks to many people. Some only once. 
768,"FEDORIN: Well, I shall know soon enough, I suppose. What exactly do you"
769,do here? 
770,FARIAH: I serve. 
771,"FEDORIN: Yes, but you're obviously not an ordinary servant. "
772,"FARIAH: No, I'm not. "
773,"FEDORIN: What, then? "
774,FARIAH: Would you like some more refreshment? 
775,"FEDORIN: No, I'll get it myself. "

778,FARIAH: Is it? I'm very glad to hear that. 
779,FEDORIN: What? 
780,FARIAH: I am Salamander's food taster. 
781,FEDORIN: Does he need one? 
782,FARIAH: There have been many attempts to poison him. 
783,FEDORIN: Dangerous job. 
784,FARIAH: Mmm. That's why it's very nice to have help for a change. 
785,FEDORIN: You mean? You mean you haven't? 
786,FARIAH: No. I didn't have time. Still taste good? Nothing bitter? 
787,"FEDORIN: No. I, I don't think so. "
788,"FARIAH: You would know by now, I think. "
789,"FEDORIN: Oh. Oh, you, you had me worried for a moment. But what on Earth made you take a job as a food taster? "
790,"SALAMANDER: She was hungry. Only thing is, now she has all the food she"
791,"needs, she's lost her appetite. Give me a drink. "
792,FEDORIN: You are well protected. 
793,"(Salamander clicks his fingers and a guard enters, pointing his gun at"
794,Fedorin.) 
795,SALAMANDER: Very well protected. Be calm. Sit down. Drink your drink. 
796,"(Jamie jumps down onto the terrace from a high wall, knocks out the"
797,guard and takes his gun.) 
798,JAMIE: Thank you for calling the guard. I was wondering what to do
799,about him. Now don't move for that box! Not if you value your life. Now
800,"all of you, back over there! That's it. "
801,(Jamie takes the intercom box.) 
802,"JAMIE: Not as well protected as you think you are, hey? Now when I say"
803,duck. 
804,(Jamie throws the intercom over the side of the terrace.) 
805,JAMIE: Duck! Get down!
806,(Astrid triggers a detonator and there is an explosion. As Salamander
807,"gets to his feet, Jamie puts the gun on the table. Two guards rush in"
808,to shoot Jamie.) 
809,"SALAMANDER: Wait! What do you do, boys, huh? Read? Sleep? It's a fine"
810,thing. Here we have an attempt to destroy me and where are you? It's
811,"not so good, boys. It's not so good. I'm watching you. Look after him. "
812,(The guards carry their colleague away.) 
813,"SALAMANDER: Better still, get rid of him. What's all this about, huh? "
814,JAMIE: I heard two men talking. They said they'd planted a bomb of some
815,"kind in your radio telephone. I tried to warn them at the gates, but"
816,they wouldn't pay any attention. 
817,SALAMANDER: So you break in? How you break in? 
818,"JAMIE: Ah well, I'm here on holiday with a friend. She's very pretty,"
819,so the guard didn't see me slip past him. 
820,SALAMANDER: Why didn't you call out and warn me? I nearly used the
821,radio telephone several times. 
822,"JAMIE: Ah you'd have had me shot, most like. "
823,SALAMANDER: Why you risk your skin to save me? 
824,"JAMIE: Well, without you the Earth hasn't much of a chance, has it? "
825,"SALAMANDER: You like to work for me, huh? You like that? "
826,"JAMIE: Oh no, you don't have to do that. I mean, you owe me nothing. "
827,"SALAMANDER: You're quite right, boy. "
828,JAMIE: And I'm on holiday. 
829,SALAMANDER: You won't find what I pay you disappointing. 
830,"JAMIE: Aye, there's my girlfriend too, though. "
831,"SALAMANDER: Oh we might be able to find something for her, hey Fariah? "
832,FARIAH: Yes. Your chef could use an assistant. 
833,"SALAMANDER: See to it. What do you say, huh? "
834,"JAMIE: Well, I'll give it a go. But I'll say this though. Your security"
835,system's rotten. There'll have to be changes. 
836,"SALAMANDER: What a boy, huh? Fariah, see he gets some proper uniform"
837,instead of this skirt. And bring him and his girlfriend to see me. 
838,"FARIAH: Come along, then. "
839,(Jamie and Fariah leave.) 
840,FEDORIN: What an extraordinary young man. 
841,"SALAMANDER: I prize loyalty very highly, my friend, and I repay it very"
842,"generously, like I do the girl Fariah, huh? "
843,FEDORIN: Can I... Can I ask you something? 
844,SALAMANDER: What is it? 
845,FEDORIN: What does Brujo mean? 
846,SALAMANDER: It's a word we use in Mexico for sorcerer. Why? 
847,"FEDORIN: Nothing, nothing. "
848,"SALAMANDER: You stay for dinner, huh? "

857,me a job. To you as well. 
858,VICTORIA: That's perfect. 
859,"ASTRID: Well done, Jamie. "

861,ASTRID: Yes. But it was nothing. 
862,VICTORIA: Jamie. Jamie! 
863,JAMIE: What? 
864,VICTORIA: Does he look like the Doctor? 
865,"JAMIE: Aye, it's so uncanny. "

870,"JAMIE: She must have eyes in the back of her head. So, he's offered the"
871,both of us a job. 
872,"VICTORIA: Oh, good. "
873,CAPTAIN: Who was that? 
874,JAMIE: Who? 
875,CAPTAIN: The other girl who was sitting there? 
876,FARIAH: Why don't you leave them alone? Do you have to treat everyone
877,as if they're criminals? 
878,CAPTAIN: He had no right to leave the Presidential Palace. 
879,FARIAH: He had every right. He came to fetch his girlfriend. Salamander
880,ordered it. 
881,CAPTAIN: I didn't hear Salamander order it. 
882,"FARIAH: Very well, go and ask him. No? Perhaps you're wise. "
883,(The Captain leaves.) 
884,FARIAH: He won't follow me. I am Fariah. How do you do? 
885,JAMIE: This is Victoria. 
886,VICTORIA: Hello. 
887,FARIAH: Hello. Jamie tells me you're studying the arts of the kitchen. 
888,"JAMIE: Aye, she's a great dishwasher. "
889,"VICTORIA: I like eating, and I'm hungry. "
890,FARIAH: Then let's see if we can't find you something to do. You can
891,work with me if you like. 
892,VICTORIA: Thank you.

895,
896,(Astrid checks that she's not being watched then
897,goes underneath the structure. Someone crawls towards her and she takes
898,out her gun.) 
899,DENES: I used to love to do this sort of thing when I was a boy. 
900,ASTRID: I'm sorry. It was the safest place I could think of. 
901,"DENES: Oh, it's all right. I'm still fit enough. "
902,ASTRID: Thank you for getting me the necessary documents. 
903,DENES: Have you been successful? 
904,ASTRID: So far. Salamander's swallowed it. 
905,DENES: I thought he would. 
906,"ASTRID: The boy's very confident. The girl, not so much. "
907,DENES: See the point is that I'm near enough to him to pick out
908,something. This was the first time I met Salamander. I must say that
909,"you were right about him, Astrid. We must get rid of him. He must be"
910,stopped. 
911,ASTRID: He will be stopped. I'm returning to Giles Kent. Can you wait
912,till we can take action? 
913,"DENES: Oh, with a bit of luck, yes. "
914,ASTRID: Fedorin. Can you trust him? 
915,(There are footsteps overhead.) 
916,"ASTRID: Oh, I've been followed. I thought I'd thrown them off. (She takes out her gun.)"
917,"DENES: No! There is enough violence as it is. Besides, Salamander"
918,mustn't get suspicious. You kill his man and he will begin to think. 
919,(More footsteps join the first set.) 
920,GUARD : You understand that strangers are to be picked up. There's
921,"been an attempt on Salamander's life. Very well, return to your patrol."
922,
923,"ASTRID: It's all right. Fedorin, would he betray you in some way? "
924,DENES: I'm trying to think of some reason why he should.
925,
926, [Palace terrace]
927,
928,(Night is falling. Fedorin is reading a dossier.) 
929,"FEDORIN: But these are all lies, Salamander. Lies, I assure you. "
930,SALAMANDER: So you say. 
931,"FEDORIN: What are you going to do? My family, my friends. "
932,SALAMANDER: (laughs) My dear man. My dear Fedorin. You don't suppose I intend to
933,"make your swindling public, huh? This is, this just an insurance, hmm?"
934,Sit down. Forget it. I tell you what I'm going to do for you.  
935,FEDORIN: What? 
936,SALAMANDER: You are going to replace Denes as controller of this Zone.
937,FEDORIN: But SALAMANDER: Don't say anything. I'll know you'll accept. 
938,FEDORIN: What do you want? 
939,SALAMANDER: I'll tell you. There will be disaster in this Zone. I cannot
940,"stop the disaster, but I can come to the aid of this Zone when it's"
941,happened. 
942,FEDORIN: And take over. I see. The Zone would be yours. 
943,"SALAMANDER: Oh, ours, Fedorin, ours. It's a partnership I'm offering"
944,"you. Either you have half of everything, or you have nothing. "
945,FEDORIN: There's Alexander Denes. 
946,"SALAMANDER: Oh yes, the popular, well beloved Denes. What a pity. "
947,FEDORIN: Pity? 
948,"SALAMANDER: Oh, didn't I tell you? Denes is going to die mysteriously."
949,An assassin. Terrible. 
950,FEDORIN: I can't do that. You can't ask me! 
951,SALAMANDER: I think I can ask you to do anything I want. 
952,(He takes back the dossier. There is a loud rumble.) 
953,SALAMANDER: My predictions are accurate! 
954,(Salamander picks up a pair of binoculars.) 
955,"SALAMANDER: The entire Eperjes-Tokaj ranges are in eruption. (Stock images of volcanic lava.)SALAMANDER: Fedorin,"
956,come and look. It's very pretty. The history of Hungary is about to be
957,rewritten. (Buildings are being destroyed and forests catch fire. Bruce enters.)BRUCE: Salamander. 
958,SALAMANDER: What are you doing here? 
959,BRUCE: I had a report there was trouble here. An attempt on your life. 
960,SALAMANDER: It was nothing. Come and look. 
961,(Bruce takes the binoculars.) 
962,BRUCE: Terrible. Those poor people. 
963,(Denes rushes in.) 
964,DENES: Salamander! What have you done? 
965,SALAMANDER: I warned you. 
966,DENES: You couldn't have known. You've done this somehow yourself! 
967,"SALAMANDER: The man's mad! Worse still, he's incompetent! I warned"
968,this man that this Zone was in danger of natural disaster and he did
969,nothing! Issued no cautions to the public. You deliberately allowed
970,your people to suffer and die. You're a traitor! 
971,DENES: You're a traitor! You contrived this for your own ends. 
972,"SALAMANDER: Bruce, I order you to arrest this man. "
973,"DENES: But this is nonsense. Fedorin, you were here. You know this is"
974,nonsense. 
975,"SALAMANDER: Denes, you are too naive. At your trial, Fedorin will be the"
976,chief witness against you.

981,(Guards stand either
982,side of Denes. Jamie is also in a guard's
983,uniform.) 
984,"CAPTAIN: Prisoner's escort, halt! "
985,"SALAMANDER: Bruce, you are head of World Security. I hold you"
986,personally responsible for this man Denes. 
987,BRUCE: Why? Don't you trust your own security? 
988,SALAMANDER: Do I have to insist? My name carries some weight in the
989,councils of the world. 
990,BRUCE: Of course it does. 
991,"SALAMANDER: Well, do as I ask. "
992,BRUCE: Very well. 
993,"SALAMANDER: Fedorin, come with me. We must make a report to the World"
994,Authority. 
995,DENES: They won't believe a word you tell them. 
996,SALAMANDER: We shall see. Fedorin. 
997,"(Salamander leaves. Fedorin stops in front of Fedorin, then follows.) "
998,"BRUCE: I'll do what I can for you, but I don't want any trouble. "
999,DENES: Don't worry. I'm looking forward to facing Salamander in public
1000,court. I won't run away.
1001,
1002, [Salamander's office]
1003,
1004,"SALAMANDER: You've done very well so far, Fedorin. (Salamander turns the dial on a wall safe.) "
1005,FEDORIN: It's nothing but a blackmail. 
1006,SALAMANDER: Blackmail? What have I threatened you with? Nothing. 
1007,FEDORIN: No. But you would if I refused to. 
1008,"SALAMANDER: Fedorin, I keep on telling you, this is just a form of"
1009,"comprehensive insurance, huh? It's nothing for you to worry about. Oh,"
1010,"my dear man, I've done nothing but praise you ever since we first met."
1011,I said you should be European Controller. I said I would support you. 
1012,FEDORIN: You found out things about me. Lies that would damage me. 
1013,"SALAMANDER: On the contrary, I'm doing you a good turn. I'm actually"
1014,suppressing facts about you. 
1015,"FEDORIN: Lies, I tell you. "
1016,"SALAMANDER: Lies, truth, who knows. But we wouldn't like to put them to"
1017,"the test, would we, huh? "
1018,"(Salamander puts the dossier in the wall safe and closes it, then gives Fedorin a"
1019,small case.) 
1020,SALAMANDER: There. 
1021,FEDORIN: What's this? 
1022,"SALAMANDER: Used in the right way, at the right time, it can dictate"
1023,"your own future, and the future of Alexander Denes. "
1024,FEDORIN: Poison?
1025,
1026,[Palace terrace]
1027,
1028,BRUCE: I want you to take a message. McCrimmon.
1029,What are you doing dressed like this? 
1030,JAMIE: Leader's orders. 
1031,"BRUCE: Well, as you're here, I've got some questions I want to ask you."
1032,
1033,"JAMIE: I've better things to do, thank you. "
1034,BRUCE: I want to know what Salamander and Giles Kent were discussing
1035,when I saw you last. 
1036,JAMIE: It's not for me to tell you that. 
1037,BRUCE: I'm concerned with Salamander's safety. Giles Kent is supposed
1038,to be his bitter enemy. 
1039,"JAMIE: Look, if Salamander wishes you to know that, I dare say he'll"
1040,tell you himself. You'll get no confidences out of me.
1041,
1042,[Palace corridor]
1043,
1044,"DENES: Well, how much longer am I to be kept here?"
1045,You choose to be insolent? 
1046,JANOS: We're waiting for the security hovercar. The volcanic eruptions
1047,have disrupted everything. 
1048,(The Captain approaches.) 
1049,"DENES: You, Captain. Isn't there a room I could wait in? "
1050,CAPTAIN: I'm simply obeying orders. 
1051,"DENES: Perhaps you might interpret your orders differently, huh? "
1052,"CAPTAIN: Mister Denes, what can I do? You are no longer the Controller."
1053,You're a prisoner here. 
1054,BRUCE: Captain? Why is Mister Denes being kept in the corridor here? 
1055,CAPTAIN: It's easier to guard him here. 
1056,BRUCE: Are you all right? 
1057,"DENES: Yes, thank you. "
1058,"BRUCE: Something to read, perhaps? "
1059,"DENES: That would be a comfort, yes. "
1060,BRUCE: The Controller is not to be treated as a convicted man before
1061,his trial. See he has whatever he wants. 
1062,(Bruce leaves.) 
1063,CAPTAIN: What can I get for you? 
1064,"DENES: Well, if we have to wait, something to eat and drink. "
1065,CAPTAIN: Very well. 
1066,"JANOS: Prison rations, Captain? "
1067,CAPTAIN: Certainly not. Nothing but the best for Controller Denes. From
1068,our Leader's own kitchens. 
1069,JANOS: Sir. 
1070,CAPTAIN: And to read? 
1071,"DENES: Well, something light. A book about foreign travels perhapsm hmm?"
1072,
1073, [Palace kitchen]
1074,
1075,(The Head Chef is working.)GRIFFIN: So you reckon you know about cooking? 
1076,"VICTORIA: Yes, I used to do lots at home. "
1077,"GRIFFIN: All right, give me a menu. "
1078,"VICTORIA: What, now? "
1079,"GRIFFIN: Yeah, now. "
1080,VICTORIA: Soup. Fish. Meat and pudding. Er.
1081,GRIFFIN: Dessert. 
1082,VICTORIA: Yes. 
1083,GRIFFIN: Go on. What else? 
1084,VICTORIA: Oh. 
1085,"GRIFFIN: Yes, you're a bit too smart for me. All right then, let's have"
1086,a recipe. 
1087,"VICTORIA: What, now? "
1088,"GRIFFIN: Yeah, now. "
1089,"VICTORIA: Er, er. Oh, yes! Yes! We used to have a lovely pudding at home, with"
1090,"lots of almonds, eggs, lemon peel, candied peel, oranges, cream and, oh"
1091,it was lovely! 
1092,GRIFFIN: You wouldn't know how to make it? 
1093,"VICTORIA: Oh it's quite simple, really. You sort of whoosh it up all"
1094,together. 
1095,"GRIFFIN: Well, that sounds easy. What's this whoosh-up called, then? "
1096,VICTORIA: Kaiser pudding. 
1097,"GRIFFIN: Oh that's great, just great. Yes, I've got a job for you, all"
1098,"right. Peel those spuds, yeah, now. "
1099,FARIAH: Is that the best you can do for her? The girl must learn. 
1100,"GRIFFIN: Back at school, are we? Well, I suppose there are worse"
1101,things. The place could be overrun with rats gnawing holes in the gas
1102,pipes so the ovens catch fire and burn the building down. 
1103,"FARIAH: It isn't that bad, Griff. "
1104,"GRIFFIN: Look, I'm only trying to help with the. See? There, you see?"
1105,This chicken's
1106,browning too soon already. It'll be as tough as rubber. 
1107,"FARIAH: Oh, Griff. "
1108,GRIFFIN: Now the soup's boiling. Did I put any salt in it? Dinner
1109,tonight's going to be national disaster. My mother was right. 
1110,VICTORIA: What? 
1111,"GRIFFIN: She wanted me to be a dustman. Here, look, do you want to do"
1112,something useful? 
1113,"VICTORIA: Oh yes, please. "
1114,GRIFFIN: Well sit down and write out the menus. First course
1115,interrupted by bomb explosion. Second course affected by earthquakes.
1116,Third course ruined by interference in the kitchen. I'm going out for a
1117,walk. It'll probably rain. 
1118,(Griffin leaves.) 
1119,VICTORIA: He doesn't like me. 
1120,FARIAH: It isn't you. He's the same with everyone. 
1121,VICTORIA: Even Salamander? 
1122,FARIAH: Listen. You must go away from here. Don't get caught up in
1123,Salamander's world. 
1124,VICTORIA: Why? What do you mean? It sounds as if you don't like him. 
1125,FARIAH: Like him? I 
1126,(Jamie enters.) 
1127,"JAMIE: Oh, hello there. "
1128,FARIAH: Finish writing those menus. 
1129,(Fariah leaves.) 
1130,VICTORIA: Did you hear that? 
1131,JAMIE: Aye. Work on her. I have a feeling she can tell us something
1132,about Salamander. 
1133,VICTORIA: All right. As soon as I can. What have you been doing? 
1134,JAMIE: I managed to slip out and tell Astrid everything that's
1135,happened. 
1136,"VICTORIA: Oh, you might have told me, Jamie. "
1137,JAMIE: There wasn't time. She's trying to get Denes away. 
1138,"VICTORIA: Oh, and take him to the Doctor? He'd believe Denes. "
1139,"JAMIE: Aye, he would. "
1140,VICTORIA: But how can she get in? Salamander's got guards everywhere. 
1141,JAMIE: She's got friends here. They're going to arrange passes and the
1142,right sort of uniform. 
1143,VICTORIA: What sort of uniform? 
1144,JAMIE: Don't know. Messenger delivery or something. Shh! 
1145, [Outside the kitchen window] 
1146,GUARD: Controller Denes has been arrested. I can't
1147,make up my mind whether Fedorin is to be regarded as the new Controller
1148,or not. 
1149,"GUARD 2: The burden of office is heavy, my friend. I remember when I"
1150,was 
1151, [Kitchen]
1152,
1153,"JAMIE: All right, they're gone. "
1154,"VICTORIA: Astrid and Giles Kent were quite right, Salamander is an evil"
1155,man. I can somehow sense it from all the people here. 
1156,"JAMIE: Aye, he's bad all right. He's had Denes arrested, and he's got"
1157,this man Fedorin eating out of his hand. 
1158,VICTORIA: Why should he do that? 
1159,"JAMIE: Remove the honest man and put a weaker man in his place, but"
1160,somehow have a hold on him. That way Salamander can take over the
1161,territory. 
1162,"VICTORIA: Oh, I see. And when everything's in a turmoil because of the"
1163,earthquakes. 
1164,"JAMIE: Aye, and that's lucky to say the least. "
1165,VICTORIA: But you don't really believe that Salamander could cause
1166,"earthquakes, do you?"
1167,
1168, [Kent's trailer]
1169,
1170,"(Outside the Kenowa Research Station, they are"
1171,watching the eruptions and lava flows on television.) 
1172,"KENT: I'm certain Salamander's causing the earthquakes, Doctor, and I'm"
1173,sure your friends Jamie and Victoria will tell you just how bad he
1174,really is. 
1175,DOCTOR: But why make earthquakes? 
1176,"KENT: Years ago, Doctor, when one country wanted to invade another it"
1177,"set about attacking the confidence of that country, throwing it into"
1178,"confusion, making it weak. Then it was right for takeover. Now, isn't"
1179,"that exactly what's happening here, only in a different way? "
1180,DOCTOR: What you're saying is that Salamander's found a way of
1181,harnessing the natural forces of the earth. It's a little difficult to
1182,"accept. I'm not saying it's impossible, mind you. You say it's coming"
1183,"from the Research Station. Salamander's Research Station, eh? "
1184,(The Doctor looks at it through a pair of binoculars.) 
1185,"KENT: That's what I believe, in spite of. Shush! Wait a minute. "
1186,(Kent looks outside.) 
1187,"KENT: In spite of a number of reasons. He invented the sunstore, a"
1188,brilliant advance. He found a way of directing conserved energy to
1189,areas starved of sun. 
1190,DOCTOR: What made you suspicious? 
1191,KENT: All the money he was spending at the Research Station. The
1192,"materials involved, the food stores. It didn't make sense. I had all"
1193,"the papers, all the requisition orders. "
1194,DOCTOR: But that's valuable evidence! 
1195,"KENT: All destroyed, and new ones appeared, and I was made out to be"
1196,"the criminal. All by suggestion, of course. I was discredited. And"
1197,every accusation I made against Salamander was put down as an attempt
1198,to throw suspicion off myself. 
1199,"DOCTOR: A sort of Jekyll and Hyde character, perhaps, our Mister"
1200,Salamander. It'll be interesting to see what report Jamie brings back. 
1201,(Vehicles with sirens are heard outside.) 
1202,KENT: Security. Quick! Here. 
1203,(Kent lifts the lid of a box seat. The Doctor gets in.) 
1204,DOCTOR: I hope there's plenty of air in here. 
1205,"KENT: Yes, yes, yes. "
1206,(Kent goes to the sink just as Benik enters.) 
1207,BENIK: So. It's you. I might have known. 
1208,KENT: Do you have any authority? 
1209,BENIK: You're on Research Station territory. 
1210,KENT: Not quite. Have a look at the boundary lines. 
1211,"BENIK: That's very clever. Well, what are you doing here? "
1212,KENT: I don't have to answer your questions. 
1213,(Benik picks up the binoculars.) 
1214,"BENIK: Bird-watching, no doubt? "
1215,KENT: Perhaps. 
1216,"BENIK: Yes, there's a perfect view of the Research Station from here. "
1217,KENT: Really? 
1218,(Benik takes a photograph of Denes off the wall.) 
1219,"BENIK: Well, well, well. A memento of the old days. "
1220,(Benik smashes the photograph.) 
1221,KENT: You have no right to 
1222,BENIK: Guard! 
1223,"(A guard enters, weapon ready.) "
1224,"BENIK: It was just an accident. Now then, you won't be staying in this"
1225,"vicinity, will you. "
1226,KENT: You can't make me leave here. 
1227,"(Benik nods to the guard, who goes to the sink and smashes the crockery.) "
1228,"KENT: Hey now, watch that! "
1229,"(Kent is pushed back, and the guard wreaks havoc on the cupboard"
1230,contents with his rifle butt.) 
1231,BENIK: All right. That's enough. 
1232,(The guard leaves.) 
1233,"BENIK: Well, there's not much point in your staying here now, is there."
1234,"Oh, I wouldn't complain to anyone about this if I were you, Kent. After"
1235,"all, nobody would believe you, would they? "
1236,(Benik leaves. Kent helps the Doctor out of the box seat.) 
1237,KENT: Come on. Now do you believe the sort of people we're up against? 
1238,"DOCTOR: Unpleasant, yes, destructive, but not necessarily evil. "
1239,KENT: Why won't you believe me? 
1240,DOCTOR: It is too important. I must be sure. Oh dear. What pretty
1241,"crockery this is. Sad really, isn't it? People spend all their time"
1242,"making nice things, and other people come along and break them. "
1243,KENT: That's what I'm trying to tell you about Salamander. He's trying
1244,to destroy the world! 
1245,"DOCTOR: Facts, Kent. I must have facts. That's what I hope Jamie's"
1246,going to bring back.
1247,
1248, [Palace corridor]
1249,
1250,JANOS: Halt! Why are you running? 
1251,ASTRID: I have an urgent message for Leader Salamander. 
1252,JANOS: Your pass? You have not been here before. 
1253,ASTRID: No. 
1254,JANOS: I thought so. Next time do not run. It is dangerous to run here.
1255,
1256,ASTRID: I'll remember. 
1257,JANOS: Wait! You like wine? My name is Janos. We drink wine together
1258,tonight? 
1259,ASTRID: I have to go and deliver my message. 
1260,"JANOS: Yes, but later you will come back? "
1261,"ASTRID: Oh yes. Yes, I'll come back. "
1262,CAPTAIN: Just a moment! 
1263,ASTRID: I have an urgent message for Leader Salamander. 
1264,"CAPTAIN: Yes, I heard you. Where is it? "
1265,ASTRID: It's private and personal. 
1266,CAPTAIN: I don't want to read it. Keep still. 
1267,ASTRID: I have to deliver this to Salamander personally. 
1268,CAPTAIN: You do have a message? 
1269,ASTRID: Of course. 
1270,CAPTAIN: Then show me. 
1271,(Astrid hands over some folded paper. The Captain hands it back.) 
1272,CAPTAIN: Very well. I know you from somewhere. 
1273,(Denes drops his book. Janos picks it up.) 
1274,"DENES: Oh, I think I must have dropped off. Thank you. "
1275,(Astrid has gone.)

1279,(Jamie is eating at the kitchen table and Victoria
1280,is laying a trolley with cutlery for a meal when Astrid enters.) 
1281,ASTRID: Sit down. Go on with what you're doing. We've got to rescue
1282,Denes. Get him away from the building. 
1283,VICTORIA: There are guards everywhere. 
1284,"ASTRID: Yes, I know, but we must try. "
1285,JAMIE: It's a pity we can't get him to the Doctor. 
1286,ASTRID: That's exactly where I intend to take him. 
1287,"JAMIE: Well, what's your plan then? "
1288,"ASTRID: Look, I want you to, well, cause a diversion. "
1289,JAMIE: What do you want me to do? 
1290,"ASTRID: Well, anything. But do it at eleven o'clock precisely. "
1291,"JAMIE: Eleven o'clock, right. "
1292,"ASTRID: I see, the second corridor on the right, thank you so much. "
1293,(Astrid leaves because Griffin has entered.) 
1294,"JAMIE: Er, yes. "
1295,GRIFFIN: Now we're a travel agency. I haven't met you before. What's
1296,wrong? It's bound to be something serious. 
1297,"VICTORIA: This is a friend of mine, Griff. "
1298,"GRIFFIN: He's not a cook like you, I hope? "
1299,VICTORIA: No. 
1300,"GRIFFIN: Oh, well that's all right then. Well, I suppose this is as"
1301,"good a place as any for meeting friends. Come one, come all, I say!"
1302,"How's the food? Terrible. Terrible. I'll get the sack tonight, I swear"
1303,"I will. Maybe they'll shoot me, and I won't have to worry any more. No, they"
1304,"wouldn't do that, the firing squad'd miss me. "
1305,FARIAH: How are you getting on with the food for Mister Denes? 
1306,"GRIFFIN: Well it's ready, such as it is. Now we don't want too much of"
1307,a crowd in here. 
1308,"JAMIE: Well, I'll be on my way, then. "
1309,"GRIFFIN: No, no. You stay. I'll go. I'm only the chef here. "
1310,(Griffin leaves.) 
1311,"FARIAH: Now, what can we give Mister Denes? "
1312,"JAMIE: Er, do you like working for Salamander, Fariah? "
1313,VICTORIA: It must be wonderful travelling all over the world with him. 
1314,"FARIAH: I don't enjoy travelling. (She tastes the soup.) Oh, this is"
1315,good. That Griff's a genius. 
1316,"JAMIE: Well, why travel then? "
1317,"FARIAH: Sometimes we do what we have to do, not what we want to do. "
1318,JAMIE: You don't have to work for Salamander. 
1319,FARIAH: Don't I? Don't I? What do you know about it? 
1320,"JAMIE: I'm sorry, I was just "
1321,"FARIAH: To you, Salamander is a god, isn't he? The saviour of the"
1322,"world. That's why you work for him. You saved his life, didn't you? "
1323,JAMIE: I 
1324,VICTORIA: Don't you protect his life every day? 
1325,"FARIAH: Yes! As I say, sometimes we do what we have to do, not what we"
1326,want to do.
1327,
1328,[Palace terrace]
1329,
1330,(Night time. Salamander is writing.) 
1331,"BRUCE: Nevertheless, whatever he's done or not done, he should be"
1332,treated according to rank. 
1333,SALAMANDER: He will be moved soon. You can't expect much sympathy for
1334,"him, you know, Bruce. Word gets around. I warned him about the"
1335,earthquakes. He could have cautioned the people. Some of them might
1336,have been saved. 
1337,BRUCE: Maybe. 
1338,SALAMANDER: No maybe about it. 
1339,BRUCE: Who's going to control this zone now? Fedorin? 
1340,"SALAMANDER: Fedorin. Oh, what a good idea."
1341,
1342, [Palace kitchen]
1343,
1344,(Victoria is pushing a trolley.)GRIFFIN: Be nice to Mister Denes. 
1345,VICTORIA: I will.
1346,
1347, [Palace corridor]
1348,
1349,(Victoria pushes the trolley along the
1350,flagstone corridor.)
1351,GRIFFIN: Give him a smile. It might make him forget the taste of the
1352,soup. 
1353,(Griffin goes back into the kitchen. Fedorin is standing in front of
1354,the trolley.) 
1355,"FEDORIN: Oh, is this for Mister Denes? "
1356,"VICTORIA: Yes, yes, I'm taking it to him. "
1357,FEDORIN: May I look? 
1358,VICTORIA: Yes. 
1359,FEDORIN: Mmm. Delicious. 
1360,(Fedorin lifts the lids and palms the salt cellar) 
1361,"FEDORIN: Ah, very good. Where's the salt? "
1362,VICTORIA: What? 
1363,FEDORIN: You forgot something. 
1364,"VICTORIA: Oh, no. Well, I "
1365,"FEDORIN: Well, you run and get it. "
1366,"VICTORIA: Yes, yes. "
1367,(Victoria runs back to the kitchen. Fedorin opens the box Salamander
1368,gave him. It contains crystals.)
1369,
1370, [Palace terrace]
1371,
1372,CAPTAIN: The same girl I saw in the park. I
1373,suddenly remembered. 
1374,SALAMANDER: You say she was talking to the boy and girl? 
1375,CAPTAIN: She was on the same bench. 
1376,SALAMANDER: Coincidence? 
1377,CAPTAIN: She wasn't in messengers' uniform then. She is now. 
1378,"SALAMANDER: Yes, she certainly hasn't delivered any messages to me. "
1379,CAPTAIN: Shall I alert the building? 
1380,"SALAMANDER: No. No, I want to know where she comes from. Let her escape"
1381,but have her followed. Frighten her away. 
1382,CAPTAIN: I understand. And the other two? 
1383,"SALAMANDER: Oh, I'll deal with them."
1384,
1385, [Palace corridor]
1386,
1387,(Victoria arrives with the trolley.) 
1388,"FARIAH: Ah, good. "
1389,VICTORIA: Sorry I've been so long. 
1390,"DENES: Oh, good. I'm looking forward to this. Thank you. "
1391,CAPTAIN: Just a moment. Has the trolley been checked? 
1392,"JANOS: I was just going to, sir. "
1393,(The Captain takes the knives from Denes.) 
1394,CAPTAIN: Don't any of you know anything? 
1395,DENES: Do you imagine I'm going to try and cut my way out of here? How
1396,do I eat without the knife? 
1397,CAPTAIN: It's none of my concern. 
1398,"FARIAH: Try the spoon, Mister Denes. "
1399,DENES: And how do you cut a steak with a spoon? 
1400,(The Captain cuts the tiny piece of meat for him.) 
1401,DENES: It's a long time since I had my food cut up for me. 
1402,CAPTAIN: Watch him carefully. JANOS: Sir. 
1403,DENES: Thank you for your courtesy. 
1404,"CAPTAIN: Fariah, come with me. I want a word with you and Griffin about"
1405,breaking regulations. 
1406,"FARIAH: Yes, sir. "
1407,(The Captain and Fariah leave.) 
1408,VICTORIA: What's the time? 
1409,DENES: Six minutes to eleven. 
1410,VICTORIA: May I stay with you? I'm Victoria. 
1411,"DENES: Yes, of course. I'd be glad of your company. If you'll forgive"
1412,"me, I'm really rather hungry."
1413,
1414, [Palace terrace] 
1415,FEDORIN: There must be some other way. I couldn't
1416,"do it, Salamander, I couldn't do it. I stood there with this man's life"
1417,"in my hands and. This powder, I couldn't use it. "
1418,SALAMANDER: I give you the chance to become something. Somebody. You
1419,"failed to take it, huh. "
1420,FEDORIN: There must be some other way. 
1421,(Salamander takes back the box of poison.) 
1422,"SALAMANDER: (laughs) Of course, my friend. Don't worry. "
1423,FEDORIN: What? 
1424,"SALAMANDER: Don't worry. You try, you fail. So what, huh? The moon"
1425,"doesn't fall out of the sky. Come, sit down, have a drink, huh? Cheer"
1426,up. We find another way. 
1427,(Salamander puts some of the poison into a wine glass.) 
1428,FEDORIN: I really did try. 
1429,"SALAMANDER: Of course you did. Don't worry. Forget it, huh? I have an"
1430,alternative. 
1431,(Salamander hands the dosed glass to Fedorin.) 
1432,SALAMANDER: Your health. I hope you'll appreciate this wine. It's made
1433,for me especially in Alaska. 
1434,"(Fedorin drinks, clutches at his throat, and dies.) "
1435,"SALAMANDER: One chance, my friend. I said one chance. "
1436,"CAPTAIN: Some trouble in the kitchens, Leader. The new man says he's"
1437,seen someone in the kitchen gardens. 
1438,"SALAMANDER: Very well. Oh, see to that, will you? Suicide, of course."
1439,Such a pity.
1440,
1441, [Kitchen]
1442,
1443,GRIFFIN: I can't see anything. 
1444,"JAMIE: Over there by the trees. Hey, he's armed, too. Get down. Look,"
1445,"I'm going out there, you stay down here. When the rest of the guards"
1446,"come, send them out after me. "
1447,"GRIFFIN: Yes, all right. "
1448,(Jamie goes out into the garden.) 
1449,GRIFFIN: This is just about the end of a perfect day. 
1450,(A shot rings out.) 
1451,"GRIFFIN: Here, I know the food's bad, but you don't have to go that far!"
1452,
1453,"(More shots, and Griffin hides under the kitchen table.) "
1454,"GRIFFIN: All right, have it your own way. Why did I ever leave"
1455,Woolloomooloo?
1456,
1457, [Palace corridor]
1458,
1459,(An armed guard runs past Janos.) 
1460,VICTORIA: Astrid's going to try and get you away. 
1461,ASTRID: An attempt has been made to rescue this man. Get him out to the
1462,car. 
1463,(Janos turns his back and Astrid knocks him out.) 
1464,"ASTRID: I'm sorry, Janos. "
1465,CAPTAIN: Stop! 
1466,(Denes is shot in the back.) 
1467,CAPTAIN: After them! 
1468,"(Victoria pushes the trolley into the guards, who fall over it.) "
1469,CAPTAIN: Get that girl!
1470,
1471, [Palace terrace]
1472,
1473,(Victoria and Jamie are under armed guard.) 
1474,"SALAMANDER: Well, we all seem to be here, except the third member of"
1475,your escape committee. 
1476,JAMIE: I don't know what you're talking about. 
1477,SALAMANDER: You were seen speaking with a girl in the park. The one who
1478,tried to escape with Denes. 
1479,VICTORIA: We don't know anything about that. We don't even know her. 
1480,SALAMANDER: A diversion was caused. There was no one outside the
1481,kitchen. 
1482,"JAMIE: Of course there was someone, and there was shooting. "
1483,"CAPTAIN: Three shots have been fired from this gun. It's yours, isn't"
1484,it? 
1485,SALAMANDER: Pretending to save my life was ingenious. But ingenuity
1486,requires a constant stream of new ideas. Yours seem to have dried up. I
1487,come to the Central Zone. An attempt is made on my life. Denes proves
1488,to be a traitor. Fedorin commits suicide because I uncover him. Do your
1489,"job, Bruce. You can see they're all in this. "
1490,BRUCE: All right. Take them away. 
1491,"VICTORIA: Take your hands off me, you"
1492,(The Captain and guards lead Jamie and Victoria away.) 
1493,"BRUCE: Salamander, I think it's about time you told me what's going on."
1494,"One minute I see you with this lad McCrimmon, you're working together,"
1495,the next minute 
1496,SALAMANDER: I thought he saved my life. 
1497,"BRUCE: No, I mean before that, in Kent's office. "
1498,SALAMANDER: What are you talking about? 
1499,"BRUCE: Well, I saw you there. "
1500,SALAMANDER: But I haven't seen Kent in months. 
1501,"BRUCE: Yes, you were with Kent, the Ferrier girl, and those two"
1502,"youngsters. I thought it was so curious I spoke to your number two,"
1503,"Benik, about it. That's really the reason I came to this zone. "
1504,SALAMANDER: But I tell you. I must get back to research centre. You
1505,will come with me. 
1506,BRUCE: It was you! (the penny drops) Or someone like you. 
1507, Episode Four
1508,
1509, [Kent's trailer]
1510,
1511,(Still outside the Research Station.) 
1512,"DOCTOR: Patience, Mister Kent, patience. "
1513,KENT: Astrid should have been in contact by now. 
1514,"DOCTOR: Oh, perhaps her plan to infiltrate into Salamander's"
1515,organisation has failed. 
1516,"KENT: Ah no, otherwise Benik's little visit here wouldn't have been so"
1517,moderate. He wouldn't have stopped at breaking up the crockery. 
1518,DOCTOR: Can't you contact her? 
1519,"KENT: If I knew where she was. Oh no, I know she's in the Central"
1520,"European zone, but that's a big place. No, we'll just have to sweat it"
1521,out and wait. 
1522,"DOCTOR: Well, your friend Benik did indicate we weren't entirely welcome"
1523,"here, you know. "
1524,"KENT: Yes, it's not safe, and taking you from place to place isn't"
1525,"easy. And I mean, you're not exactly inconspicuous, are you? "
1526,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. Well, I suggest we give her another hour, and then"
1527,"if she doesn't contact us by then, we'll move out and find out what has"
1528,happened. 
1529,"(Meanwhile, Astrid has returned to Kent's office. She turns on the"
1530,videolink.) 
1531,"KENT: Astrid, you're back. Switch to scramble. "
1532,[Records room]
1533,
1534,ASTRID : Scramble? Are we being
1535,monitored? 
1536,KENT  It's possible. 
1537,ASTRID : Right. Switching now. 
1538,"(The pictures and sounds scramble, so Benik turns on the security"
1539,channel.) 
1540,BENIK: Has Leader Salamander's ship arrived at the terminal? 
1541,"GUARD : I think it's due now, sir. "
1542,BENIK: Good. Contact the guard. And I want the girl Astrid Ferrier
1543,traced. She's Giles Kent's assistant. I'll have an identiprint sent
1544,down immediately. She's somewhere in this zone. 
1545,"GUARD : Yes, sir. "
1546,"BENIK: Tell the Captain to inform me the moment he's found her, and to"
1547,hurry. 
1548,GUARD : Sir.
1549,
1550, [Kent's office]
1551,
1552,KENT : Denes dead? 
1553,"ASTRID: Yes, shot in the back. "
1554,"KENT  : Well, it looks as if our friend Salamander's had a"
1555,"real field day, doesn't it? "
1556,"ASTRID: I'm afraid I haven't done very well.KENT : Don't worry. It's not your fault. Look, stay"
1557,put and we'll join you.(Transmission ends. There is a knock at the door.
1558,"Astrid hides behind it as it opens, then pulls it wide to pull the"
1559,visitor in.) 
1560,ASTRID: You! What are you doing here? 
1561,"(Astrid grabs Fariah from behind, arm around her throat.) "
1562,"ASTRID: No, don't be foolish. What are you doing here? "
1563,FARIAH: I can't talk. You're choking me. 
1564,"(Astrid releases Fariah, but keeps her covered with a gun.) "
1565,ASTRID: One move. Just one move. FARIAH: You think Salamander sent me here. 
1566,"ASTRID: Well, didn't he? "
1567,"FARIAH: No, it was my own idea. I came here to see Giles Kent. "
1568,ASTRID: Why? 
1569,FARIAH: I have some information for him. 
1570,ASTRID: Why should you want to help him? 
1571,FARIAH: Because I hate Salamander probably even more than you do. I can
1572,help you to destroy him. I want to be there to see his face when he
1573,dies.
1574,
1575, [Records office]
1576,
1577,"BENIK: Come on, come on. "
1578,(The monitor lights up.) 
1579,BENIK: About time too. Is the Captain there? 
1580,"GUARD : Yes, sir. "
1581,"CAPTAIN : Here, sir. The girl Astrid Ferrier. She was in"
1582,the Central European zone. 
1583,BENIK: Was she? Well she's here now. Have you found her? 
1584,"CAPTAIN : Well, I think so. One of my men saw someone"
1585,answering her description going into Giles Kent's office earlier. 
1586,BENIK: Was she alone? 
1587,"CAPTAIN : Yes, sir. But shortly after someone else followed"
1588,her in. 
1589,"BENIK: Well who, man, who? "
1590,"CAPTAIN : Leader Salamander's food-taster sir, Fariah. "
1591,"BENIK: Fariah? Right, I want the place surrounded, and I'll join you"
1592,there. Get a move on! 
1593,CAPTAIN : Yes sir. 
1594,BENIK: Fariah.
1595,
1596, [Kent's office]
1597,
1598,DOCTOR: But what are they going to do to Jamie and
1599,Victoria? 
1600,ASTRID: I don't know. 
1601,KENT: Hold them in the Central European zone until Salamander has time
1602,to deal with them. 
1603,"FARIAH: No, you're wrong. Salamander doesn't care for loose ends. He"
1604,brought them back with him. 
1605,"DOCTOR: What, to his headquarters, the Research Centre? "
1606,FARIAH: Yes. He's going to try to get information from them. 
1607,DOCTOR: How far will he go to get it? 
1608,FARIAH: Very far. 
1609,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's very comforting. "
1610,"FARIAH: I tell you, I know Salamander. "
1611,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm not quite clear about your part in all this. You work"
1612,"for Salamander, suddenly you fall over yourself to betray him. "
1613,"FARIAH: I came here for that purpose, yes. "
1614,DOCTOR: Why? 
1615,FARIAH: Because I have every reason to hate Salamander. He blackmailed
1616,me into being his personal servant. I even had to smile when he told me
1617,to. 
1618,KENT: What sort of blackmail? What had you done? 
1619,FARIAH: Does it really matter? 
1620,"DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, of course not, my dear. Well, nobody's perfect,"
1621,Kent. But I still can't help wondering why 
1622,FARIAH: Why I haven't tried to expose Salamander? 
1623,"DOCTOR: Well, you were in a unique position to do so. "
1624,FARIAH: Because without any proof I'd be wasting my time. 
1625,DOCTOR: Proof! Proof! Proof! It always comes back to the same thing. No
1626,one has any evidence against Salamander! 
1627,KENT: We have some. 
1628,DOCTOR: Not enough! It's not enough! Salamander covers up too well. 
1629,FARIAH: I have what you want. 
1630,ASTRID: But I thought that you said 
1631,FARIAH: No. Not about me. Fedorin. 
1632,ASTRID: Fedorin? A public embezzler who commits suicide? 
1633,"FARIAH: Salamander engineered nearly every one of those swindles, and I"
1634,can prove it. 
1635,ASTRID: How? 
1636,(Fariah produces the dossier.) 
1637,FARIAH: Fedorin's file. 
1638,DOCTOR: But that's wonderful. Let me see. I'll give it to you back.
1639,Thank you. 
1640,(The Doctor inspects the documents.) 
1641,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Yes."
1642,
1643, [Outside the office block]
1644,
1645,"GUARD: Report your position, A three. "
1646,"CAPTAIN: Keep well back, sir. "
1647,BENIK: Is the building surrounded? 
1648,"GUARD: A three's in position, Captain. "
1649,CAPTAIN: Just closing up the gaps. 
1650,"BENIK: Well, you haven't brought me here on a fool's errand, I hope? "
1651,"CAPTAIN: Still inside, sir. "
1652,BENIK: Where's Kent's office? 
1653,CAPTAIN: Up on the second floor. 
1654,"BENIK: Hmm, right. We'll move in. "
1655,"CAPTAIN: Just a moment, sir. What about the roof? "
1656,"GUARD: No reply yet, Captain. Position A five, position. "
1657,"BENIK: Come on, come on."
1658,
1659, [Kent's office]
1660,
1661,DOCTOR: But I'm afraid this still isn't evidence.
1662,It's not real evidence. 
1663,KENT: You mean even this doesn't convince you about Salamander? 
1664,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm not saying that. "
1665,"ASTRID: Well then, you'll do it? You'll impersonate him? "
1666,FARIAH: And of course when they see you with me they're bound to think
1667,you're Salamander. 
1668,DOCTOR: But I still don't know if I can carry it off. 
1669,KENT: It's the only way to get your friends released. 
1670,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1671,"KENT: Of course, there are "
1672,"DOCTOR: Oh, I see. Yes, of course, there are conditions, aren't there?"
1673,"You help me, I defeat Salamander. "
1674,"KENT: Now look, you're giving me the biggest opportunity I'll ever have"
1675,of ridding the world of this monster. Either I can convince you one way
1676,or I'll have to do it another. 
1677,"DOCTOR: What you really want me to do is to kill him, isn't it? "
1678,KENT: What else do you do when someone is evil? 
1679,"DOCTOR: Private justice, eh? Oh no, no. I'll expose him, ruin him, have"
1680,"him arrested, but I won't be his executioner. No one has that right. "
1681,KENT: Sometimes it's necessary. 
1682,DOCTOR: No! 
1683,"KENT: Yes, Doctor, yes! When the inducement is strong enough, and in"
1684,"your case, yes, you still want your friends out of danger? "
1685,DOCTOR: You can't bargain with people's lives like that! 
1686,"KENT: I can. Either you get rid of Salamander, or we won't lift a"
1687,finger to help your friends. 
1688,"FARIAH: Mister Kent, look. "
1689,(Kent goes to the window.) 
1690,KENT: I'd make up my mind quickly if I were you. 
1691,DOCTOR: Why? 
1692,KENT: Have a look out of the window. 
1693,"DOCTOR: Well, what is it?"
1694,
1695, [Outside the office block]
1696,
1697,"GUARD: A five reporting in, Captain. Every man's in"
1698,position now. 
1699,"CAPTAIN: Right, we'll move in. "
1700,BENIK: Tell all men to shoot on sight. 
1701,"CAPTAIN: I can't accept responsibility like that, sir. "
1702,BENIK: You won't have any responsibility unless you do as I say. These
1703,"people are terrorists. Give the order! (The Captain nods reluctantly.)GUARD: All A positions, shoot on sight. "
1704,BENIK: Forward.
1705,
1706, [Kent's office]
1707,
1708,KENT: No doubt of it. They're security men. 
1709,FARIAH: And they're closing in. 
1710,"DOCTOR: Well, isn't there another way out of here? "
1711,KENT: The usual ways will be blocked. 
1712,ASTRID: The fire escape. 
1713,(Kent goes to another window.) 
1714,"KENT: Up there, look! "
1715,(The guards are coming down from the roof.) 
1716,"DOCTOR: More down there, too. "
1717,"(At the bottom of the emergency exit, a woman pushes a pram past three guards.) "
1718,FARIAH: What do we do now? 
1719,"KENT: Over here, quick! "
1720,DOCTOR: What's that? 
1721,KENT: Through here. The ventilator shaft. 
1722,"ASTRID: Giles, we can't. "
1723,"KENT: Yes, of course. "
1724,FARIAH: Wait. The file. 
1725,"KENT: Come on, quickly. "
1726,DOCTOR: But where does it go? 
1727,KENT: It doesn't matter. Come on.
1728,
1729,[Outside Kent's office]
1730,
1731,CAPTAIN: It's locked. 
1732,BENIK: Kent! Why don't you just let us in. It'll save so much unpleasantness.
1733,
1734, [Kent's office]
1735,
1736,KENT: Now look. Just relax and you won't feel a
1737,thing. 
1738,(Fariah slides down the shaft.) 
1739,"KENT: Now you, Doctor, next. "
1740,BENIK : Kent! Open the door. 
1741,"DOCTOR: Oh no, what about you? "
1742,"ASTRID: Oh no, you're too important. You go, and Giles. I'll follow. "
1743,KENT: All right. 
1744,BENIK : Very well.
1745,
1746,[Outside Kent's office]
1747,
1748,BENIK: You leave me no alternative. Break it down. 
1749, [Kent's office]
1750,
1751,(Kent and the Doctor climb into the shaft. Astrid shoots at the door.) 
1752,BENIK : Get back! 
1753,ASTRID: Get away from that door! 
1754,BENIK : Can you hear me in there? Why don't you come out? 
1755,ASTRID: I can hear you. 
1756,BENIK : How long do you think you can hold out against us?
1757,
1758,[Outside Kent's office]
1759,
1760,BENIK: Standing by? 
1761,"GUARD: A five, progress. "
1762,BENIK: Well? 
1763,"GUARD: He's outside the window now, sir. "
1764,"(In the office, paper rustles in a slight breeze. Astrid turns as a guard comes"
1765,"in through the window. They struggle for the gun and it goes off, pointing at the ceiling. Astrid knocks the guard out.) "
1766,"BENIK: He's through, Sergeant. Smash that lock."
1767,
1768, [Kent's office]
1769,
1770,(The guards break in.) 
1771,BENIK: Well? Well? 
1772,CAPTAIN: Empty. 
1773,BENIK: The air ducts. They've disappeared through the air conditioning
1774,plant. Is there a manhole exit from the plant to the street? 
1775,"GUARD: I don't know, sir. "
1776,"BENIK: Well, find out! On the double! CAPTAIN: Attention all A positions. Cover the street. Send"
1777,to the air conditioning plant. 
1778,BENIK: Tell your men to shoot to kill! 
1779,"CAPTAIN: Shoot to kill. Repeat, shoot to kill. "
1780,(Benik and the Captain leave. Astrid comes out from under the desk.)
1781,
1782,[Alleyway]
1783,
1784,"(Fariah, with the dossier, has become separated from"
1785,the others. She encounters a guard in an alleyway. He shoots her.) 
1786,CAPTAIN: What do you think you're doing? 
1787,GUARD: We had orders to kill. 
1788,CAPTAIN: Do you always obey orders? 
1789,"GUARD: I'm sorry, Captain. "
1790,"CAPTAIN: Oh, never mind. Go and search for the others. "
1791,(The guard leaves.) 
1792,"GUARD: I'm sorry, but you should have stopped. "
1793,BENIK: Did you get the others? 
1794,"GUARD: Not yet, sir. "
1795,"BENIK: Now listen to me. There was you, Astrid Ferrier, Giles Kent and"
1796,another. Who was the other man? 
1797,"FARIAH: You'll know soon, soon enough. "
1798,BENIK: I want to know now. (Benik puts his gun to Fariah's head.)
1799,"CAPTAIN: Sir, you "
1800,BENIK: Shut up! Well? 
1801,"FARIAH: You can't threaten me now, Benik. I can only die once, and"
1802,someone's beaten you to it. 
1803,BENIK: Who was the other man? CAPTAIN: Sir!  She's dead. 
1804,BENIK: Good. 
1805,(Benik picks up the dossier.) 
1806,BENIK: Fedorin's file. Thank you.
1807,
1808, [Records room]
1809,
1810,SALAMANDER: What you mean is you failed. 
1811,BENIK: I always said something should be done about Kent. 
1812,SALAMANDER: You always say. You say things but you don't think. 
1813,"BRUCE: You exceeded your authority, Benik. A woman's been killed. "
1814,BENIK: Resisting arrest. 
1815,"BRUCE: Maybe, but you can't just take the law into your own hands."
1816,Giles Kent hadn't broken any rules that I know of. 
1817,BENIK: I was sure he'd show himself one day. He was simply building up
1818,his resistance group. 
1819,SALAMANDER: Resistance group. The man's a traitor! These people are
1820,"rebels. Bruce, you must find this man who impersonated me. The dangers"
1821,are obvious. He could walk in anywhere at any time pretending to be me
1822,and ruin everything. 
1823,BRUCE: You can leave that to me. 
1824,SALAMANDER: How so? 
1825,"BRUCE: Benik, come with me and I'll go over the security arrangements"
1826,with you now. 
1827,SALAMANDER: Do as you're told! 
1828,(Bruce leaves. Benik produces Fedorin's dossier.) 
1829,BENIK: I think you'll find this interesting. 
1830,(Benik gives the dossier to Salamander.) 
1831,SALAMANDER: What? The girl Fariah had this? What can I say? 
1832,"(Benik leaves, smiling broadly. Salamander turns on the intercom.) GUARD : Yes, sir? "
1833,SALAMANDER: The records room is out of bounds. I am not to be
1834,"disturbed. See that the security locks are engaged. GUARD: Very well, sir. For how long, sir? "
1835,"SALAMANDER: For as long as I say so. GUARD : Yes, sir. "
1836,(An alarm sounds. Shutters slide down across
1837,the doors and a man-sized capsule slides out from a recess in a wall.
1838,"Salamander enters it. The capsule slides back into the wall, turns to"
1839,the vertical and the shutters close. Salamander presses a button and
1840,the capsule descends into the earth very quickly. Thunderbirds are go.)
1841,
1842, [Outside the records room]
1843,
1844,"BRUCE: Are you telling me that no one, no one at"
1845,all can see Salamander? 
1846,"GUARD: No one, sir. "
1847,BRUCE: Can you communicate with him on closed circuit? 
1848,"GUARD: I'll try, sir. He's turned off the master switch. Sorry, sir. "
1849,BENIK: Here are all the security details. What's the matter now? 
1850,BRUCE: It seems that Salamander has locked himself away and can't be
1851,got at. 
1852,BENIK: So? 
1853,"BRUCE: Well, suppose the place caught fire? "
1854,BENIK: It won't. 
1855,BRUCE: Don't be foolish! 
1856,"BENIK: Look, I can only tell you that when Salamander works in records,"
1857,"as he does from time to time, no one is allowed in. "
1858,BRUCE: I could understand if it were a laboratory or a research room of
1859,"some sort, but a records room? What sort of records have you got in"
1860,there anyway? 
1861,BENIK: What did you want to see him about? 
1862,BRUCE: Never mind. I just don't like mysteries. Salamander's far too
1863,important to lock himself away like this. Anything might happen. A
1864,world emergency. Suppose I had to order you to let me in there? 
1865,BENIK: It wouldn't do any good. When the locks are switched over they
1866,can only be opened from the inside.
1867,
1868,[Underground main room]
1869,
1870,(Salamander enters a
1871,small room from the capsule and puts his jacket into a desk drawer and
1872,"locks it. He is now wearing a dirty boiler suit. He turns on a monitor screen. In another room, a group of men and women are walking around with clipboards, attending machines"
1873,and wall panels.) 
1874,SALAMANDER : I have returned. Take radiation precautions. I will
1875,make a report about the surface. 
1876,SWANN: He's back. He's managed to get back again.COLIN: Let's hope he's got some good
1877,news this time. 
1878,"MARY: Do you think Salamander's found some more food, Swann? "
1879,"SWANN: I hope so, otherwise we're finished. Where's that stock list? "
1880,COLIN: Here. 
1881,SWANN: Thank you. 
1882,MARY: Are you going to ask him? 
1883,"COLIN: You bet I am. He'll take me, too. "
1884,"MARY: Colin, I couldn't sleep a wink last night thinking about you"
1885,making the trip. None of the others have come back. 
1886,"COLIN: Don't stop me now. I've got to see the surface, Mary, I've got"
1887,"to. I want to see the Sun again, walk on top of the Earth, not hide"
1888,"like a rat underground. I've got to do it, Mary. I've got to ask him. "
1889,MARY: Yes. 
1890,[Underground control room]
1891,
1892,"SWANN: Welcome back, Salamander. Are you all right?"
1893,
1894,"SALAMANDER: Don't don't come too near, my friend. I am not yet"
1895,decontaminated. I am too weary. Too utterly weary. 
1896,"SWANN: You shouldn't have made this trip, Salamander. You're doing too"
1897,much. 
1898,"SALAMANDER: Someone has to bring back the food for you, my friend, huh?"
1899,"You know that the radiation is slowly killing me, don't you, Swann? "
1900,SWANN: You're just doing too much. 
1901,SALAMANDER: I worry about you all the time. What're you going to do
1902,when I am no longer here? 
1903,(Salamander walks into a decontamination booth. The Geiger counter
1904,chatters.) 
1905,"SALAMANDER: The radiation gets a little more each time, huh? One day,"
1906,that needle will stay at maximum radiation. 
1907,MARY: Don't say that. 
1908,"SALAMANDER: Why, Mary, Colin. It's my big joke, huh? Just to frighten"
1909,you a little. I've got good news for us. 
1910,COLIN: We can return to the surface? 
1911,"SALAMANDER: No, no, no, not yet, but I've found another store of food. "
1912,COLIN: Thank goodness! 
1913,"SALAMANDER: And it is undamaged. Colin, open the last store of wine, huh?"
1914,"Go on, you help him too, Mary. "
1915,(Colin and Mary leave.) 
1916,"SWANN: You must take it slowly, for goodness sake. "
1917,"SALAMANDER: I'm all right my friend, I'm just a little dizzy. It's"
1918,"terrible up there, you know. Swann, you've no idea. Right, I am ready. "
1919,[Underground main room]
1920,
1921,(The wine is being poured.) 
1922,"SALAMANDER: Here we are, my friends. (They cheer him.)SALAMANDER: Oh please, no. It is enough that I"
1923,am back with you again and I have brought food for you. Plenty of food.
1924,
1925,SWANN: Here's to the man who contrived
1926,"SALAMANDER: Please, Swann. I remembered on my way back down here that"
1927,"we are near our anniversary again. In a few short weeks, we survivors"
1928,will have been down in this shelter for exactly five years. 
1929,CROWD: Five years. 
1930,SALAMANDER: Colin and Mary were just teenagers then. Look at them now.
1931,"We fed ourselves. But what's more than that, we are fighting back! We"
1932,are doing something! 
1933,CROWD: Yes! Yes! 
1934,"COLIN: Will we return to the surface, Salamander? "
1935,"SALAMANDER: Yes, of course we will. This is what I'm striving for. But"
1936,"up there, it's terrible still. The war goes on and on, and you never know"
1937,when the air is clean or when it's poison. 
1938,COLIN: When can we return? 
1939,"SALAMANDER: We have to fight for a while longer, hmm? Creating natural"
1940,"disasters, monsoons, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, always in the"
1941,places where the enemies of truth and freedom gather together. 
1942,"COLIN: You tell us this all the time, Salamander. When are we going to"
1943,"escape from this nightmare prison, that's all I'm asking you? "
1944,"MARY: Colin, please. "
1945,COLIN: I want an answer! 
1946,"SALAMANDER: You shall have an answer, my friend. You will return to the"
1947,surface when you have a good chance of survival. 
1948,(Salamander staggers.) COLIN: You are ill.
1949,"SALAMANDER: No, no, it's all right. But you must believe me. Colin, all"
1950,of you. You cannot return to the surface until is safe to do so. Please
1951,"my friend, we must, we must"
1952,(Swann and Salamander return to the control room.) 
1953,"MARY: You shouldn't have asked him, Colin. He's doing his best. "
1954,"COLIN: I can't help it, Mary. Next time, I'm going to make him take me"
1955,with him. 
1956,MARY: No. You know the others didn't come back. 
1957,COLIN: I've got to. 
1958,MARY: Then take me with you. I'd rather die with you up on the surface
1959,than live down here without you. 
1960,(At the control room door.) 
1961,"SALAMANDER: No, Swann. We must check the power levels, huh? (Salamander closes the door. Swann returns.)"
1962,"SWANN: All right, everyone to their places, please. Salamander wants to"
1963,"check the power levels. Come along there, come on. Full blast, that's"
1964,"right. Check the meter levels. Full power on line one, Salamander."

1973,(Astrid is putting makeup on the Doctor.) 
1974,DOCTOR: But I still don't understand what's happened to Fariah. 
1975,KENT: She went the wrong way. We lost her. 
1976,"DOCTOR: Well, we must find her! You don't seem to realise how vital it"
1977,is. 
1978,"ASTRID: Doctor, hold still a moment will you? "
1979,"DOCTOR: Sorry.(She combs his hair into a parting, then holds up a photograph of Salamander.) "
1980,"ASTRID: There. Look at that, Giles, isn't it amazing? "
1981,KENT: Salamander to the life. 
1982,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's not bad. "
1983,"ASTRID: Shush, I think I heard something. "
1984,"DOCTOR: Well, perhaps it's Fariah. "

1989,
1990,BRUCE: Stay where you are. I've been looking
1991,"forward to meeting you again. Over there. No, not you. "
1992,(Kent and Astrid move away from the Doctor.) 
1993,"BRUCE: Sit down, all of you. "
1994,KENT: How did you find us? 
1995,"BRUCE: Your last visitor was Salamander's deputy, Benik. When he left,"
1996,he fixed this underneath your trailer. 
1997,ASTRID: A radio tracking device. 
1998,KENT: On whose authority? 
1999,BRUCE: Mine. 
2000,(Bruce looks at the Doctor.) 
2001,BRUCE: It's amazing how alike you and Salamander are. Incredible. You
2002,"fooled me the first time we met, but now, even Salamander himself would"
2003,think he was looking in a mirror. Why? You want this man to impersonate
2004,"Salamander, why? How much are they paying you? "
2005,DOCTOR: I beg your pardon? 
2006,"BRUCE: They want you to assassinate Salamander, don't they? Take his"
2007,place? 
2008,DOCTOR: But that's ridiculous! I couldn't possibly do that. 
2009,"BRUCE: But you were preparing to impersonate him, weren't you? "
2010,"DOCTOR: Well, well, yes. "
2011,"BRUCE: All right then, why? "
2012,DOCTOR: Because Salamander holds my two friends prisoner. I was
2013,going to attempt to rescue them. 
2014,ASTRID: And at the same time get evidence that would expose Salamander
2015,"as a traitor, blackmailer and murderer. "
2016,BRUCE: Quite an ambitious plan. How do you know such evidence exists? 
2017,KENT: It exists in Salamander's records. 
2018,"BRUCE: Oh, yes, I know why you want Salamander out of the way. You hate"
2019,him because he exposed your profitable sideline of misusing public
2020,money. 
2021,"ASTRID: Oh, it was Salamander who was misusing the money. "
2022,KENT: And I was dismissed from my post and the evidence against
2023,Salamander concealed. 
2024,"BRUCE: So you say. But you've no evidence at all against Salamander,"
2025,have you? 
2026,KENT: I tell you the evidence is in Salamander's records. 
2027,BRUCE: And I'm expected to take that from you? 
2028,DOCTOR: We do hold evidence that Salamander isn't quite so pure and
2029,white as he's painted. 
2030,BRUCE: No? What? 
2031,"DOCTOR: A file, containing certain information about a gentleman called"
2032,Fedorin. 
2033,ASTRID: Salamander was going to use this evidence against Fedorin.
2034,"Blackmail him into submission. After he'd got rid of Denes, that is. "
2035,KENT: And so gain control of another zone. 
2036,BRUCE: Where is this file? 
2037,DOCTOR: Fariah has it. Salamander's food taster. (Oops. The Doctor covers his mouth.)
2038,BRUCE: Fariah? But she's dead. 
2039,DOCTOR: Dead? But how? 
2040,"BRUCE: She was shot by one of Benik's guards escaping arrest. DOCTOR: Oh, that's terrible."
2041,KENT: Escaping arrest? Benik had her killed because she had evidence
2042,against Salamander. 
2043,ASTRID: And Benik will return the file to Salamander. We must get to
2044,the Research Station. 
2045,BRUCE: You're not going anywhere or doing anything. As far as I'm
2046,"concerned, this story you've told me could be a pack of lies to cover"
2047,your attempt to assassinate Salamander. Now I'm not saying I'm
2048,"altogether satisfied with Salamander or his organisation, but I'll"
2049,investigate in my own way. 
2050,"KENT: Meanwhile Salamander will have found a way to cover himself, and"
2051,"also a way of disposing of you. You're digging your own grave, Bruce. "
2052,BRUCE: That's my affair. And I do things my own way. 
2053,(Astrid grabs the guard's gun.) 
2054,"ASTRID: And I do things my way. Really, as Head of Security, you should"
2055,have more reliable guards.

2061,BENIK: Let me know the moment the doors are opened. 
2062,"GUARD: Yes, sir. "
2063,"(Two stretchers are carried across the corridor, with Jamie and"
2064,Victoria on them.) 
2065,BENIK: So you've brought them? Good. Any trouble? 
2066,"CAPTAIN: No, a light drug saw to that. "
2067,BENIK: Let me know the moment they wake up. 
2068,"CAPTAIN: Yes, sir. "
2069,BENIK: I'm looking forward to questioning them. I have a feeling
2070,they're going to be stubborn. It''s so much more interesting when our
2071,prisoners are stubborn.

2073, [Kent's trailer]

2075,BRUCE: You're only making trouble for yourself.
2076,Killing me won't get you anywhere. 
2077,"ASTRID: We have to get to the Research Station, and you're not going to"
2078,stop us. 
2079,BRUCE: But you're completely surrounded. You don't really believe I
2080,"came here with just one guard, do you? You'd be very silly to try and"
2081,fight your way out. I'd give you about thirty seconds to live if you
2082,try. 
2083,"KENT: All right, Bruce, we might have just thirty seconds but you'd"
2084,"have exactly half that time, if you were lucky! "
2085,"DOCTOR: Please, Mister Kent! You're forgetting one very important"
2086,thing. 
2087,KENT: What? 
2088,DOCTOR: Me. Without me you haven't got an earthly chance of getting in
2089,that control centre. 
2090,KENT: So? 
2091,DOCTOR: I told you before. I will not have anything to do with
2092,violence. 
2093,KENT: And what about your two friends? Are you going to leave them to
2094,the tender mercies of Salamander? 
2095,"DOCTOR: No, I am not. May I? "
2096,(The Doctor holds his hand out to Astrid.) 
2097,ASTRID: What? 
2098,DOCTOR: Please? Just trust me.

2103,KENT + ASTRID: What are you doing? 
2104,BRUCE: Hold it. 
2105,"DOCTOR: It's all right. Mister Bruce isn't going to shoot anyone, are"
2106,you?
2107,BRUCE: Why? Why'd you do that? 
2108,DOCTOR: Because I think I know what sort of man you are. Honest and
2109,reasonable. 
2110,BRUCE: Go on. 
2111,DOCTOR: I gave you back that gun because I trust you. Now I want you to
2112,trust me. 
2113,BRUCE: You must be a complete fool or very clever. 
2114,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm afraid you will have to make up your mind to that"
2115,right away. 
2116,BRUCE: What do you hope to gain by this gesture? 
2117,DOCTOR: Your confidence. 
2118,BRUCE: Do you believe Kent's accusations against Salamander? 
2119,DOCTOR: I think there's reasonable doubt about Salamander's personal
2120,"integrity, but there's only one way to get proof. "
2121,BRUCE: By getting into Salamander's Research Station. 
2122,DOCTOR: Yes. And my two young friends may have some information. 
2123,BRUCE: And if there isn't any evidence? 
2124,DOCTOR: Then you'll be perfectly free to arrest us and put us in
2125,"prison, won't you? "
2126,"BRUCE: All right, I'll do it on one condition. "
2127,DOCTOR: And what's that? 
2128,BRUCE: That you and I go alone. Kent and the girl stay here as
2129,hostages. 
2130,KENT: Now wait a minute. I must go with him. 
2131,"BRUCE: No, Kent, you stay here. I must be mad to trust you. I only hope"
2132,"your impersonation of Salamander fools Benik. If it doesn't, we're in"
2133,"dead trouble. Here, take this. "
2134,(Bruce gives the gun to the guard.) 
2135,"BRUCE: Keep those two in the caravan. Oh, and watch the girl. Come on."

2138,
2139,"SALAMANDER: Swann, I'm back in the control room."
2140,
2141, [Underground main room]
2142,
2143,SALAMANDER : I placed the new food cases on the
2144,conveyor. Detail some men to unload them. Then make a report on
2145,schedule seven. 
2146,"SWANN: Jones, Morris, Hunt. Now remember, if there's any contamination"
2147,showing up at all on the register you must tell me immediately. (A
2148,hatch slides open revealing a conveyor belt with a cardboard box
2149,labelled Milk on it. The men remove it and another labelled Canned
2150,Beans comes into view.)
2151,COLIN: Swann. Have you ever thought what would happen to us if
2152,Salamander didn't come back from the surface one day? 
2153,SWANN: No. He always comes back. And talk like that isn't healthy. I've
2154,"told you about this before, Colin. "
2155,COLIN: You can live in a dream world if you want to. 
2156,SWANN: Morale is important down here. 
2157,"COLIN: Reality is important, too. Facing facts! "
2158,MARY: Colin. 
2159,"COLIN: Yes, all right. I know. "
2160,(Colin moves away.) 
2161,"MARY: I'm sorry, Swann. "
2162,SWANN: He's the best man I've got. 
2163,MARY: I know. 
2164,SWANN: If only he'd just accept the fact that everything will 
2165,MARY: He never will. 
2166,SWANN: He must be more patient then. We'll get out of here one day. 
2167,MARY: Will we? 
2168,SWANN: Of course we will. Salamander says so. 
2169,MARY: Yes. 
2170,(Swan moves away. Colin returns to Mary.) 
2171,COLIN: Blind idiot. Why does he think everybody else has to be an idiot
2172,too? 
2173,"MARY: We daren't let people think, Colin. Swann's all right. "
2174,"COLIN: I don't think it's right. Just work, sleep, eat, if there's"
2175,"enough to go round. Like worms under the earth, sightless worms"
2176,"wriggling about without hope, without purpose. "
2177,MARY: It isn't like that. 
2178,COLIN: Isn't it? All this? Every day I ask myself what are we doing
2179,down here. 
2180,MARY: You've never doubted him before. 
2181,"COLIN: I don't know. I don't say I doubt him, but just once, Mary, just"
2182,once I want to see with my own eyes what's going on up there. Me. Not
2183,hear about it from anybody else.
2184,"SWANN: Are you getting on with your work? Mustn't fall behind, you"
2185,"know. Come on, Colin. We all get depressed. I know how you feel. "
2186,COLIN: I'm sorry. 
2187,SWANN: That's all right. 
2188,(Swann goes to the food boxes.) 
2189,"SWANN: Ah, how we getting on here? Ah, all this? It's a good haul. (He picks up a very light box labelled Meat.)"
2190,"SALAMANDER : Stand by to make your report, Swann. "
2191,(Swann notices a piece of paper stuck to another box.) 
2192,"MARY: Reaching full power here, Swann. (Swann goes to the door to the control room. It is locked. He uses the intercom.)"
2193,"SWANN: Salamander, I must see you."
2194,
2195, [Underground control room]
2196,
2197,"SALAMANDER: Not now, we are too busy. "
2198,SWANN : This is urgent. 
2199,SALAMANDER: Oh very well. 
2200,(Swann enters with the piece of paper.) 
2201,"SALAMANDER: Now what's the matter, huh? "
2202,SWANN: What's this? What is this? 
2203,SALAMANDER: What? 
2204,SWANN: Newspaper. It's a piece of newspaper. 
2205,SALAMANDER: So? 
2206,"SWANN: Well, go on, look at it. Read it. Last year's date. Look at the"
2207,"bit of headline there. There! (Holiday liner sinks, many feared lost. Dated Friday August 16, 2017.)"
2208,"SALAMANDER: Control yourself, Swann. You'll go mad. "
2209,"SWANN: Holiday Liner Sinks! You say there's a global war, radiation"
2210,everywhere. How can there be holiday liners? Tell me how! You've lied
2211,"to us, haven't you? Haven't you! "
2212,"SALAMANDER: In a way, Swann, yes. I had to. "
2213,"SWANN: Had to? What do you mean, had to? "
2214,"SALAMANDER: Well, it's true that the war is over, but have you any idea"
2215,what happens to people who've been involved in a nuclear war? Have you?
2216,
2217,SWANN: Of course I haven't. I've been down here. 
2218,SALAMANDER: Those who are lucky enough to escape the annihilation have
2219,their bodies eaten away by radiation poisoning. They're deformed in
2220,mind and body. 
2221,"SWANN: But this, this, this newspaper? "
2222,"SALAMANDER: They have a kind of society, but it's evil, corrupt. You"
2223,don't think I could expose you to that sort of thing? Think of Mary and
2224,the other women. 
2225,SWANN: You could have told me at least. 
2226,SALAMANDER: I decided not to. 
2227,SWANN: You should have told me. 
2228,SALAMANDER: I thought it was best. 
2229,SWANN: And what about the natural disasters we've been organising? The
2230,"volcanoes, earthquakes? "
2231,"SALAMANDER: Swann, they are not fit to live. "
2232,"SWANN: You're murdering them, killing them off. "
2233,SALAMANDER: I want you and the others to inherit the Earth. Make a new
2234,world. 
2235,"SWANN: Yes, I know all about that, but not at the price of wholesale"
2236,murder. 
2237,"SALAMANDER: It's not murder! If you could see, you would understand."
2238,It's an act of mercy. 
2239,SWANN: There must be some other way. 
2240,SALAMANDER: No! 
2241,SWANN: I won't take your word any more. I want to see for myself. 
2242,"SALAMANDER: You, you, you, you''d be horrified.  "
2243,SWANN: Maybe. 
2244,SALAMANDER: The radiation would kill you. 
2245,SWANN: I'll chance that. 
2246,SALAMANDER: Very well. But promise me one thing. You won't tell the
2247,others. 
2248,SWANN: Why shouldn't I? 
2249,"SALAMANDER: Because I am right and you are wrong! You wouldn't want to,"
2250,"you wouldn't want to hurt them like that, huh? "
2251,"SWANN: And if you're lying, and I want to tell when I get back? "
2252,SALAMANDER: How can I stop you? You'd better tell them you're coming
2253,"with me. Say er, say you've persuaded me. Swann, trust me. Don't go ahead with"
2254,"this, huh? "
2255,SWANN: I have to.
2256,
2257, [Underground main room]
2258,
2259,SWANN : This is Swann speaking. It's nearly a
2260,year since anyone went on the surface with Salamander. 
2261,COLIN: Salamander's changed his mind. He's going to take me with him.
2262,
2263,[Underground control room]
2264,
2265,SWANN: There are more stores to bring down too.
2266,Salamander can't do it all on his own. We'll both be back soon with
2267,"good news, I hope. "
2268, [Underground main room]
2269,
2270,COLIN: Why not me? Why? I asked him. He turned me
2271,down. 
2272,MARY: Colin. 
2273,"COLIN: Why not me? Why not me? Salamander, take me with you! Take me"
2274,with you! 
2275,"MARY: They've gone. It's no good. Please, Colin. "
2276,"COLIN: Why didn't he take me? I've got to get out of here, Mary. I've got to"
2277,get out.
2278,
2279,[Interrogation room]
2280,
2281,VICTORIA: Jamie? Jamie? 
2282,JAMIE: What? Oh. 
2283,"VICTORIA: Here, drink this. The headache soon goes. "
2284,JAMIE: Where are we? 
2285,VICTORIA: I don't know. 
2286,JAMIE: Let's find out. 
2287,(Jamie goes to the door. Benik enters with a guard.) 
2288,BENIK: Don't leave us so soon. We're going to have a little talk. 
2289,JAMIE: Where are we? 
2290,BENIK: You're in the Australasian zone. I had you brought here
2291,especially. 
2292,JAMIE: Why? 
2293,BENIK: So that Salamander could ask you some questions. 
2294,"JAMIE: For all the answers he's going to get, he might as well have left"
2295,us there. (Jamie sits down.)
2296,BENIK: Stand up when you talk to me! 
2297,JAMIE: You'll get nowhere by shouting. 
2298,BENIK: On the contrary. I'm going to get everything I want from you
2299,two. 
2300,JAMIE: We'll not tell you a thing. 
2301,BENIK: (laughs) That's good. I like that. 
2302,JAMIE: What? 
2303,"BENIK: Spirit. Resistance. And you've got plenty of both, haven't you,"
2304,"boy? Well I wonder how long you'll last. Five minutes? No, a little"
2305,"longer, maybe. Ten, perhaps? "
2306,JAMIE: What do you mean? 
2307,"BENIK: Come now, you don't think I'm just going to sit here and ask"
2308,"questions, do you? "
2309,JAMIE: You must have been a nasty little boy. 
2310,"BENIK: Oh, I was. But I had a very enjoyable childhood. "
2311,"(Jamie punches the guard, but Benik gets Victoria"
2312,with his gun at her head.) 
2313,"BENIK: Yes, I thought so. Spirit, plenty of spirit. "
2314,(Benik releases Victoria.) 
2315,"BENIK: Oh, we're going to enjoy ourselves, aren't we? Now then. "
2316,VICTORIA: I thought you were going to take us to see Salamander. 
2317,"BENIK: Yes, I will. But he'll expect me to do my little best first. "
2318,JAMIE: You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you. 
2319,BENIK: Will you? How? No. I think the time's come for you to answer my
2320,"questions, don't you? Come here, girl! If you don't, I shall have to"
2321,"shoot one of you. Oh, not a mortal wound. In the leg, perhaps? "
2322,JAMIE: You'd better go. Don't worry. 
2323,"BENIK: There, that's better. Oh, such pretty hair, don't you think. (Benik pulls Victoria's head back.)"
2324,"JAMIE: All right, leave her alone. What do want to know? "
2325,"BENIK: Quite a lot. And you're going to tell me everything, aren't you."
2326,
2327,JAMIE: All right. Yes. 
2328,BENIK: Who's behind you? Is it Giles Kent? 
2329,(The door opens.) 
2330,"SALAMANDER: Ah, so they're here, are they? "
2331,"BENIK: Salamander, I thought you were in Records? "
2332,SALAMANDER: Have they told you anything yet? 
2333,BENIK: Not yet. 
2334,"SALAMANDER: Very well. Bruce and I will take over. You may go. And er, take"
2335,"your little puppy dog with you, hmm? "
2336,(Benik and his guard leave.) 
2337,SALAMANDER: Now. 
2338,JAMIE: We can't tell you anything. 
2339,SALAMANDER: Of course not. We know everything. We know about Giles
2340,"Kent, we know about the girl called Astrid, and we know about your"
2341,"friend, the Doctor. "
2342,VICTORIA: I don't believe you. 
2343,"SALAMANDER: A childish plan to impersonate me. That's the truth, isn't"
2344,it? 
2345,"JAMIE: Ah, but he didn't agree to it. "
2346,SALAMANDER: You two were sent to the Central European zone to stir up
2347,trouble.
2348,"VICTORIA: If you want to know he truth, Giles Kent told us a story and"
2349,"we weren't sure. Before the Doctor could do anything, we had to come"
2350,here and find out what person you were like. 
2351,"JAMIE: Yeah, and we found that out right enough. "
2352,"SALAMANDER: You see, Bruce, they're just terrorists. Not very big fry,"
2353,either. All this nonsense about proof against me. 
2354,"VICTORIA: If you're doing so much good for the world, why are you so"
2355,afraid for your own life? 
2356,"JAMIE: Aye, why do you have so many enemies? "
2357,VICTORIA: Personal guards. 
2358,JAMIE: Your own food taster. 
2359,"VICTORIA: And why destroy the one man the people trusted, Alexander Denes? "
2360,JAMIE: Aye. 
2361,"BRUCE: What do you mean, destroy? "
2362,VICTORIA: One of your men shot him. 
2363,BRUCE: Trying to escape? 
2364,VICTORIA: He shot him deliberately. 
2365,"JAMIE: Aye. And that girl Fariah, well, she was close to Salamander."
2366,She'd speak against him. I know she would. 
2367,SALAMANDER: Fariah is dead. 
2368,VICTORIA: Dead? 
2369,"JAMIE: You've had her murdered too, have you? "
2370,VICTORIA: Why you. 
2371,"DOCTOR: Oh, Victoria, don't hit me! You wouldn't hit your old friend"
2372,"the Doctor, would you? I wouldn't leave you in the tender mercy of"
2373,Salamander. 
2374,JAMIE: Doctor? 
2375,DOCTOR: You don't believe me. Oh. 
2376,"(The Doctor pretends to pull a descant recorder out of his inside pocket, then whistles 'Twinkle Twinkle Little"
2377,Star while he mimes playing it. Jamie joins in.) 
2378,DOCTOR: Only you made me leave it in the Tardis. 
2379,JAMIE: It is him! Doctor! 
2380,"VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor! "
2381,BRUCE: Tardis? Tardis? What's that? 
2382,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a little place that we three have in common. You must"
2383,admit they thought I was Salamander to begin with. 
2384,BRUCE: Yes. I concede that. But there's still no proof. 
2385,"DOCTOR: No, but there's enough doubt in your mind to make you go on"
2386,"asking questions, isn't there? That's why we came here."
2387,
2388, [Outside the records room]
2389,
2390,BENIK: I told you to let me know when Salamander
2391,was out of Records. 
2392,"GUARD: But no one's come out, sir. "
2393,BENIK: What did you say? 
2394,"GUARD: He hasn't come out, sir."
2395,
2396, [Underground tunnel] 
2397,SWANN: Wait. What happens up there? 
2398,"SALAMANDER: Oh, it ends in a ruined building. This is where I bring the"
2399,stores. You would be safer here. 
2400,SWANN: Safer? 
2401,"SALAMANDER: Yes, the radiation. I don't think it filters down here. "
2402,SWANN: I still want to see the surface. 
2403,"SALAMANDER: You will, you will."
2404,
2405, [Kent's trailer]
2406,
2407,KENT: I should have insisted on going with him.
2408,Bruce should have taken me. 
2409,ASTRID: You know he doesn't trust you. 
2410,KENT: He wouldn't trust his own grandmother. 
2411,"ASTRID: Oh, never mind, Giles. We've come a long way. Months ago, well,"
2412,"a few weeks ago even, nobody would have even listened to you. "
2413,"KENT: Ah, maybe. "
2414,ASTRID: There's no maybe about it. 
2415,"KENT: Yeah, perhaps you're right. Bruce listens to us at last. He's"
2416,"even prepared to ask questions, that's fine, but I know Salamander."
2417,He'd talk his way out of a quicksand. 
2418,"ASTRID: Well, what else can we do? The guard's still outside. "
2419,KENT: I must get into the Research Centre. I've got to make sure that
2420,"Bruce understands the evidence. Understands it, Astrid. Don't you"
2421,realise he mightn't know what he's looking for. I know. 
2422,ASTRID: But we can't attack the guard. It would only make matters
2423,worse. 
2424,KENT: Not if I was to give Bruce real evidence. 
2425,"ASTRID: Giles, how long would it take you to get to the Research Station? "
2426,"KENT: Well, just a few minutes. I've got a pass. It's just a matter of"
2427,getting there. 
2428,"ASTRID: All right, I think I can help you. I'll draw the guard off and"
2429,leave you alone. 
2430,KENT: You think you can do it? 
2431,"ASTRID: Yes, I think so. "
2432,KENT: But I thought you said we weren't going to attack the guard? 
2433,"ASTRID: Oh, we're not going to attack the guard. But there is going to"
2434,be an attack. A fatal one.
2435,
2436, [Underground tunnel]
2437,
2438,SWANN: Where does this lead? 
2439,SALAMANDER: It goes on up and comes out in a field. 
2440,SWANN: What about radiation? 
2441,"SALAMANDER: Here, it's almost negligible. (They pass some packing cases.)"
2442,SWANN: You mean you could have brought others here from below? I don't
2443,"understand you. Don't you realise what a break it would be for them,"
2444,just moving away from that underground tomb once in a while? 
2445,"SALAMANDER: You seem to forget, Swann, I've brought people up here"
2446,before. There's always an element of risk. 
2447,SWANN: I still want to have a look at these people you say are living
2448,on the surface. Where does that lead? 
2449,"SALAMANDER: Oh, that's a dead end. It's a place I sometimes rest. It's"
2450,"very hard work, you know, bringing all this"
2451,"SWANN: Yes, I know that. This way, then? "
2452,"SALAMANDER: You sure you won't change your mind, huh? "
2453,"(Behind Swann's back, Salamander picks up a metal bar from on top a packing case.) "

2458,forehead.) 
2459,GUARD: What's going on here? 
2460,ASTRID: He's been shot through the window. 
2461,"GUARD: All right, stand back. Looks as though he's finished. Better get a doctor"
2462,"anyway, just in case. "
2463,(Astrid runs out.) 
2464,GUARD: Hey! Come back!

2466,up his jacket and leaves.)

2483,JAIMIE: What other explanation is there?

2485,shred of evidence that Salamander is attacking the world with natural
2486,disasters? 
2487,"JAMIE: Well, he must be. "
2488,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's what I believe. "
2489,BRUCE: But it's beyond belief. How could he possibly? 
2490,DOCTOR: I'm sure we'll find proof in the Records Room. 
2491,"BRUCE: Maybe, but that's where Salamander is. "

2513,"BENIK: Well, you always told me they had priority over everything. "
2514,"DOCTOR: Oh, very well. "
2515,"(The Doctor takes the forms, sits at the desk and looks at them.) "
2516,BENIK: By the way. 
2517,DOCTOR: Yes? 
2518,BENIK: The door to the Record Room is jammed. It was all right when you
2519,"came out, wasn't it? "
2520,DOCTOR: Yes. 
2521,"BENIK: Well, it won't open now. May I have your key? "
2522,(The Doctor checks his pockets.) 
2523,DOCTOR: I'm going mad. I left it in there. What a fool. 
2524,"BENIK: It's all right, I'll use the emergency key. "
2525,"DOCTOR: Yes, do that, will you? Right away. Oh, please don't wait for"
2526,these. 
2527,(Benik leaves.) 
2528,DOCTOR: (normal) That was close. 
2529,BRUCE: How long was he standing there listening to us? 
2530,DOCTOR: I don't know. 
2531,JAMIE: Do you think he's on to us? 
2532,DOCTOR: I hope not. But he's done us a good turn in bringing me these.
2533,"This'll interest you, Bruce. How many people do you say work in the"
2534,research centre? 
2535,"BRUCE: Fewer than you'd think. It's fully automated, you know. Six"
2536,"engineers, and six guards on duty at any one time. "
2537,"DOCTOR: A dozen, eh? Will you tell me why thirty people are catered for"
2538,here?

2541,
2542,(Astrid dabs her damp handkerchief to Swann's forehead.) 
2543,SWANN: The war. How bad was the war? 
2544,ASTRID: War? I didn't understand you. I wish there was something I
2545,could do for you. 
2546,"SWANN: What's he done? What's he done? He's kept us prisoners. Listen,"
2547,there are others. There are more people down the shaft. ASTRID: Others?SWANN: Salamander's
2548,"kept us down there, prisoners, years of it. Promise you'll bring them"
2549,to the surface. Swear it. You've got to swear it. 
2550,(Swann dies of his head wound.) 
2551,"ASTRID: Yes, I swear it."

2554,
2555,"(The Doctor is speaking into a communicator, as"
2556,Salamander.) 
2557,DOCTOR: This is Salamander. I want a security escort to come to the
2558,interrogation room immediately. I am releasing two prisoners. They are
2559,to be conducted to the main gates and set free. Is that understood?
2560,Good. 
2561,(The Doctor puts down the handset.) 
2562,"DOCTOR: (normal) Well, I hope that works. "
2563,JAMIE: So do I. 
2564,VICTORIA: What do you want us to do when we get outside? 
2565,BRUCE: There are plenty of public phones in the area. Dial double zero
2566,one and ask for a man named Forrester. 
2567,JAMIE: Eh? 
2568,BRUCE: He's my deputy to this area. 
2569,VICTORIA: Double zero one Forrester. 
2570,BRUCE: Tell him where I am and just say redhead. 
2571,VICTORIA: Redhead. 
2572,BRUCE: Redhead. Is that clear? 
2573,JAMIE: Redhead? Is that your wife? 
2574,BRUCE: It's our emergency call. 
2575,JAMIE: Sorry. 
2576,(The intercom buzzes.) 
2577,"DOCTOR: (as Salamander) Salamander. (listens) Is the, is the pass in order? Very well,"
2578,you have my authority. 
2579,JAMIE: What's all that about? 
2580,"DOCTOR: (normal) We have a visitor. Now, Bruce, you're going to get your"
2581,"proof, but I want you to do one thing. "
2582,BRUCE: What? 
2583,DOCTOR: I want you to take my two friends to the gates and see they get
2584,away all right. 
2585,BRUCE: What are you going to do? 
2586,DOCTOR: You are to go straight to the Tardis as soon as you can. 
2587,"JAMIE: No, wait a minute. "
2588,BRUCE: What is this Tardis? 
2589,VICTORIA: It's a sort of space. 
2590,DOCTOR: Shh. 
2591,VICTORIA: House. House we live in. 
2592,BRUCE: I don't think you heard me the first time. What are you going to
2593,do?

2617,"(The people come out, brandishing sticks and other weapons. They force"
2618,"Astrid into a corner.) ASTRID: No! Please, no! (The group are holding Colin back.) COLIN: Please, let me go. It's a girl, a human being. MARY: What about the radiation? (He breaks free.)ASTRID: Please stop, please.COLIN: What's the matter with you? Are you all mad? Get back! Get back!"
2619,
2620,ASTRID: Thanks. 
2621,"COLIN: First, don't move. I don't know who you are, but you must be"
2622,carrying radiation. 
2623,ASTRID: What? 
2624,"COLIN: You're from the surface, aren't you? "
2625,ASTRID: Radiation? MARY: How'd you get down here? 
2626,COLIN: Did you see Salamander? And Swann? What about Swann? 
2627,ASTRID: Swann sent me. 
2628,MARY: Swann? Where is he? 
2629,ASTRID: He's dead. 
2630,"MARY: You see, Colin, Salamander was right. He always said if we went"
2631,up to the surface we'd die of radiation. 
2632,"ASTRID: No, not radiation. Salamander killed him. "
2633,CROWD: No. No. I don't believe her. ASTRID: He's lying to you. CROWD: It can't be
2634,true. 
2635,"ASTRID: He's been keeping you prisoners, I don't know why. MARY: But that's impossible. ASTRID: Now listen"
2636,to me. 
2637,"COLIN: Now, wait! We must decontaminate you. There's equipment in"
2638,Salamander's control room. In there. 
2639,ASTRID: All right.
2640,
2641, [Underground control room]
2642,
2643,COLIN: In there. (Astrid steps into the alcove. The meter leaps to 200 Rontgens.)COLIN: You see? Radiation. 
2644,(The meter drops to zero.) 
2645,COLIN: You can come out now. 
2646,ASTRID: I'm all right? 
2647,"COLIN: Yes. Now tell us, what's this about Swann? "
2648,ASTRID: No. Just watch. 
2649,(Astrid takes a ruler from the desk.) 
2650,ASTRID: Look at the meter. 
2651,(Astrid puts the ruler the booth. The meter rises to 200 then drops
2652,to zero again.) 
2653,"ASTRID: This machine's a fake. Is this ruler contaminated? Look, see"
2654,"those valves? There's an invisible ray. Break it, and it works the"
2655,meter. 
2656,COLIN: But Salamander built this. 
2657,MARY: He built it. He always uses it when he comes down. 
2658,"ASTRID: Yes, I know, to try to convince you for some reason or other"
2659,that there's radiation above ground. 
2660,MARY: There is. The war. 
2661,ASTRID: War? What war? 
2662,COLIN: Where is he? Where's Salamander? 
2663,ASTRID: That's just what I would like to know.

2669,CAPTAIN: Wait. Where are you going? 
2670,JAMIE: Leader Salamander's orders. 
2671,CAPTAIN: What orders? 
2672,JAMIE: He's released us. 
2673,CAPTAIN: I wasn't informed. 
2674,BRUCE: I was. 
2675,CAPTAIN: Where are the release papers? 
2676,BRUCE: Are you questioning my word? 
2677,"CAPTAIN: No, of course not, sir, but there are strict rules. "
2678,"BRUCE: Rules? Really? You forget, I'm World Security Controller. I make"
2679,"rules and break them. And men, Captain. Come on, you two. "
2680,CAPTAIN: Find Deputy Benik. Quickly. 
2681,GUARD: Sir!
2682,
2683, [Underground control room]
2684,
2685,ASTRID: But I can only take two at a time. 
2686,MARY: I'm sure they all understand that. 
2687,COLIN: Where is he? I must find Salamander. 
2688,MARY: Are you sure you don't want me to wait here with them? 
2689,"ASTRID: No. Now that Swann's dead, you two seem to be the leaders. After"
2690,"what you've told me, we must confront the man that started all this,"
2691,face to face.
2692,
2693, [Research Station corridor]
2694,
2695,(Giles Kent adjusts a wall monitor to show the
2696,interior of the records room. He sees Salamander sitting at the desk.

2698,"GUARD: Yes, sir, the door's jammed and I can't get a view of the inside"
2699,of it all. 
2700,BENIK: Right. So Bruce and the rest of them are in the interrogation
2701,room?
2702,"GUARD: Yes, sir. The Captain felt something was wrong and so do I, sir."
2703,"One minute Leader Salamander's locked in the Records room, the next"
2704,"he's in the interrogation room. It doesn't make sense, sir. "
2705,BENIK: Of course it doesn't make sense if you haven't got any sense.
2706,Just stand guard and try and keep your wits about you. 
2707,"GUARD: Yes, sir. "
2708,(Benik leaves.)
2709,
2710, [Records room]
2711,
2712,(Kent goes into the records room
2713,door and seals the door.)SALAMANDER: Giles Kent. What are you doing here? 
2714,"KENT: Oh, I've been looking forward to this meeting. You're getting"
2715,"careless. You didn't double lock the doors. Oh, its all right, I've"
2716,done it now. The only way anybody can get through there is to blast
2717,their way through. 
2718,SALAMANDER: How did you get into the Research Centre? 
2719,"KENT: Oh, you know me. There isn't a pass in the world I can't get my"
2720,hands on if I put my mind to it. 
2721,SALAMANDER: You won't find it so easy getting out. 
2722,"KENT: Really? Well, we'll see. I'm not on my own this time. I've got"
2723,"friends here with me, and between us we're going to fix you once and"
2724,for all. 
2725,"SALAMANDER: You always were a tiresome man, Kent. "
2726,"KENT: I'm going to be more than tiresome this time. You know, the"
2727,biggest mistake you ever made was not killing me when you had the
2728,chance. 
2729,"SALAMANDER: Oh, so you going to kill me, huh? How petty. What good do"
2730,you think that will do? 
2731,"KENT: Hold it! (Kent produces a gun.)KENT: Now, don't move quickly. My nerves are a bit shaky at"
2732,the moment.

2736,(Bruce and Benik are watching on the wall monitor.)
2737,
2738,BRUCE: We must get in there somehow. 
2739,"BENIK: We can't without the emergency key, and Salamander has it in"
2740,there. 
2741,GUARD: We could burn our way in. 
2742,BENIK: Never. 
2743,BRUCE: Why not? 
2744,BENIK: It's an X-structure alloy. You'd hardly scratch the surface. 
2745,"BRUCE: We'll have to try it. Get the gear up here, fast."
2746,
2747, [Records room]
2748,
2749,"KENT: (laughs) Never get away with it. Oh, that's good,"
2750,"coming from you. Or don't you realise you're dispensable, and the world is"
2751,going to get along fine without you from now on. The only good idea you
2752,"ever had in your life was getting rid of me, and you couldn't even do"
2753,"that properly, could you? And now I'm back and you're finished. (whirring noise) Oh,"
2754,what's that? 
2755,SALAMANDER: They're breaking down the door. 
2756,"(Keeping his gun on Salamander, Kent adjusts a monitor to view what is"
2757,happening outside.)

2761,
2762,"GUARD: It's not cutting, sir. "
2763,"BRUCE: Never mind, keep at it. I'll have that, thanks. (Bruce takes Benik's gun, hurting Benik's wrist in the process.)"
2764,GUARD: It's no good sir.

2772,"KENT: You're a fool, Salamander. You don't think I've forgotten"
2773,"already, do you? "
2774,SALAMANDER: What? 
2775,"KENT: I've been with you too many times in this room in the past, not"
2776,to know where this leads to. 
2777,(He opens the door to the vertical shaft.) 
2778,"KENT: Your little bolt-hole. Half way down the tunnel, a passage out to"
2779,the fields and enough explosives down there to stop you or your thugs
2780,following me. 
2781,"DOCTOR: (normal) Well, that's very interesting, Mister Kent. Why didn't"
2782,you tell me that before? 
2783,"KENT: Oh no, it can't be. "
2784,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm afraid it is. Oh, look. Here's another surprise for"
2785,you. Look behind you. 
2786,"KENT: Astrid, you've come just in time.(She points her gun at Kent. Colin and Mary are with her.) "
2787,"ASTRID: It's too late, Giles. I know everything. "
2788,COLIN: That's him. That's the man who took us down there in the first
2789,place. 
2790,MARY: Giles Kent. We thought you were dead. 
2791,"KENT: Now look, I've never seen these people before in my life. "
2792,ASTRID: They've told me everything. You and Salamander were in it
2793,together.

2796,himself is watching it all on a monitor screen.)

2798,for an endurance test. The next person they saw was Salamander.
2799,
2800, [Records room]

2802,ASTRID: Who told them that an atomic war had
2803,started. 
2804,"DOCTOR: You see, Kent(Kent grabs the Doctor and holds a gun to his head.)"
2805,"ASTRID: Oh, be careful, Doctor. He'll kill you. "
2806,MARY: You kept us down like animals. 
2807,COLIN: Why? Why did you do it to us? 
2808,"KENT: We had to have someone create the natural disasters, didn't we? And we fooled you all! "
2809,"DOCTOR: You didn't fool me, Kent. "
2810,KENT: You didn't suspect me. 
2811,DOCTOR: Any man who resorts to murder as eagerly and as rapidly as you
2812,"must be suspect. You didn't just want to expose Salamander, you wanted"
2813,to kill him and take his place. 
2814,KENT: And I will! Do you think you're going to stop me? And these
2815,"people? Now move out of the way, quick! We'll see who'll stop me! "
2816,"(Kent pushes the Doctor away, gets into the capsule and it does down.) "
2817,DOCTOR: Stop him. Stop him. He's going to try and blow the place up! 
2818,ASTRID: Come on then. 
2819,"DOCTOR: No! Don't touch that door, it's red hot. "
2820,ASTRID: What do you mean?

2842,"all research personnel detained, and you can begin with Benik here."

2851,Any chance of getting us out of here? Things are going to turn rather
2852,nasty in a minute.

2864,"KENT: I tell you, they know. "
2865,"SALAMANDER: So what do you want me to do, huh? Bury our differences? I"
2866,didn't need you once. I still don't need you. 
2867,"KENT: Now wait a minute. The place is mined, we know that. We planned"
2868,"it for years, together. Between us we can destroy them all, and the"
2869,"evidence. Just you and me, Salamander. "
2870,"SALAMANDER: You and me. What use are you to me? You were useful once,"
2871,but now.

2932,"VICTORIA: Oh, there you are, Doctor. You do look in"
2933,a state. Come and sit down. 
2934,"JAMIE: I told you he wouldn't be long. You, you worry too much. "
2935,VICTORIA: We shouldn't have left him. 
2936,"JAMIE: You see, after the explosion, Doctor, we didnae know what to do."
2937,"You said to come back here, which we did, but I'm sure we were"
2938,followed. 
2939,"VICTORIA: Please, can we start straight away? "
2940,"(The little man is staring at the console, confused. He gestures at Jamie.)"
2941,
2942,"JAMIE: Me, Doctor? But you said we were never to touch the controls. "
2943,"DOCTOR: Quite right, Jamie. "
2944,(The real Doctor is in the doorway.) 
2945,DOCTOR: Welcome to the Tardis. 
2946,"SALAMANDER: Thank you. You're doing so well impersonating me, I thought"
2947,I might return the compliment. 
2948,DOCTOR: And Giles Kent? 
2949,"SALAMANDER: Unfortunately, he didn't survive the explosion. "
2950,"DOCTOR: We're going to put you outside, Salamander. No friends, no"
2951,"safety, nothing. You'll run, but they'll catch up with you. (Salamander lunges for the console.)DOCTOR: No! "
2952,(Salamander pins the Doctor against the console.) 
2953,SALAMANDER: And now I'm going to kill you. 
2954,"JAMIE: No, you don't. "

2956,dematerialises while the doors are still open.) 
2957,"VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor! "
2958,DOCTOR: Victoria! Jamie! Hold onto something! 
2959,"(The Doctor, Jamie and Victoria lie on the floor holding hands and hang"
2960,on to a chair leg which amazingly doesn't move.) 
2961,DOCTOR: Jamie! Oh!
