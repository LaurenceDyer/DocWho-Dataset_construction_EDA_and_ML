20,(The Tardis materialises. Rose and the Doctor get
21,out.) 
22,ROSE: How long have I been gone? 
23,DOCTOR: About twelve hours. 
24,"ROSE: Oh. Right, I won't be long. I just want to see my mum. "
25,DOCTOR: What're you going to tell her? 
26,"ROSE: I don't know. I've been to the year 5 billion and only been gone,"
27,"what, twelve hours? No, I'll just tell her I spent the night at"
28,"Shareen's. See you later. Oh, don't you disappear. "
29,"(While Rose runs up the stairs to the flat, the Doctor spots an old"
30,poster half stuck to a concrete pillar. Police Appeal for Assistance.
31,Can You Help?)
32,
33,[The Tyler's flat]
34,
35,ROSE: I'm back! I was with Shareen. She was all
36,"upset again. Are you in? So, what's been going on? How've you been?"
37,What? What's that face for? It's not the first time I've stayed out all
38,night. 
39,(Jackie drops her mug of tea. It smashes on the floor. The Doctor
40,finishes reading the poster and runs to the flat. The poster says -
41,Rose Tyler has been missing from her home on the Powell Estate since
42,6th March 2005.) 
43,JACKIE: It's you. 
44,ROSE: Of course it's me. 
45,"JACKIE: Oh, my God. It's you. Oh my God."
46,"(Jackie hugs Rose, who spots several different types of missing person"
47,posters on the table. The Doctor runs in.) 
48,"DOCTOR: It's not twelve hours, it's twelve months. You've been gone a"
49,whole year. Sorry. 
50,"(Outside, a young boy has spray-painted Bad Wolf on the side of the"
51,"Tardis. Inside, astonishment has given way to fury, and a policeman has"
52,been called.) 
53,"JACKIE: The hours I've sat here, days and weeks and months, all on my"
54,"own. I thought you were dead, and where were you? Travelling. What the"
55,"hell does that mean, travelling? That's no sort of answer. You ask her."
56,She won't tell me. That's all she says. Travelling. 
57,ROSE: That's what I was doing. 
58,JACKIE: When your passport's still in the drawer? It's just one lie
59,after another. 
60,ROSE: I meant to phone. I really did. I just I forgot. 
61,"JACKIE: What, for a year? You forgot for a year? And I am left sitting"
62,here. I just don't believe you. Why won't you tell me where you've
63,been? 
64,"DOCTOR: Actually, it's my fault. I sort of er, employed Rose as my"
65,companion. 
66,"POLICEMAN: When you say companion, is this a sexual relationship? "
67,ROSE + DOCTOR: No. 
68,"JACKIE: Then what is it? Because you, you waltz in here all charm and"
69,"smiles, and the next thing I know, she vanishes off the face of the"
70,"Earth! How old are you then? Forty? Forty five? What, did you find her"
71,on the Internet? Did you go online and pretend you're a doctor? 
72,DOCTOR: I am a Doctor. 
73,"JACKIE: Prove it. Stitch this, mate! "
74,"(Jackie hits the Doctor, hard. Later, in the kitchen, mother and"
75,daughter are reconciled.) 
76,JACKIE: Did you think about me at all? 
77,"ROSE: I did. All the time, but "
78,JACKIE: One phone call. Just to know that you were alive. 
79,ROSE: I'm sorry. I really am. 
80,"JACKIE: Do you know, what terrifies me is that you still can't say."
81,"What happened to you, Rose? What can be so bad that you can't tell me,"
82,sweetheart? Where were you?
83,
84,[Powell Estate]
85,
86,(Up on the roof of the block.) 
87,ROSE: I can't tell her. I can't even begin. She's never going to
88,forgive me. And I missed a year. Was it good? 
89,DOCTOR: Middling. 
90,ROSE: You're so useless. 
91,"DOCTOR: Well, if it's this much trouble, are you going to stay here"
92,now? 
93,"ROSE: I don't know. I can't do that to her again, though. "
94,"DOCTOR: Well, she's not coming with us. "
95,ROSE: No chance. 
96,DOCTOR: I don't do families. 
97,ROSE: She slapped you! 
98,"DOCTOR: Nine hundred years of time and space, and I've never been"
99,slapped by someone's mother. 
100,ROSE: Your face. 
101,DOCTOR: It hurt! 
102,ROSE: You're so gay. When you say nine hundred years? 
103,DOCTOR: That's my age. 
104,ROSE: You're nine hundred years old. 
105,DOCTOR: Yeah. 
106,ROSE: My mum was right. That is one hell of an age gap. Every
107,conversation with you just goes mental. There's no one else I can talk
108,"to. I've seen all that stuff up there, the size of it, and I can't say"
109,"a word. Aliens and spaceships and things, and I'm the only person on"
110,planet Earth who knows they exist. 
111,"(There is a deep horn and a spaceship, trailing black smoke passes"
112,"overhead and heads for the city. It misses Tower Bridge, weaves around"
113,St
114,"Paul's, then with a nasty back-fire and a splutter, dives for the"
115,"Thames, taking out the Clock Tower at what at first glance looks like"
116,"9:58 except the dial is actually backwards, silly special effects"
117,people. Big Ben chimes once and the spaceship crashes into the river.
118,The Doctor and Rose watch a plume of black smoke rise into the air on
119,the horizon.) 
120,"ROSE: Oh, that's just not fair."
121,
122,[Street]
123,
124,"(Naturally, the army have closed the roads, much to"
125,the annoyance of car drivers.) 
126,MAN: Just my luck. 
127,SOLDIER: Get back. Get back. 
128,DOCTOR: It's blocked off. 
129,ROSE: We're miles from the centre. The city must be grid locked. The
130,whole of London must be closing down. 
131,DOCTOR: I know. I can't believe I'm here to see this. This is
132,fantastic! 
133,ROSE: Did you know this was going to happen? 
134,DOCTOR: Nope. 
135,ROSE: Do you recognise the ship? 
136,DOCTOR: Nope. 
137,ROSE: Do you know why it crashed? 
138,DOCTOR: Nope. 
139,"ROSE: Oh, I'm so glad I've got you. "
140,"DOCTOR: I bet you are. This is what I travel for, Rose. To see history"
141,happening right in front of us. 
142,"ROSE: Well, let's go and see it. Never mind the traffic, we've got the"
143,Tardis. 
144,DOCTOR: Better not. They've already got one spaceship in the middle of
145,London. I don't want to shove another one on top. 
146,"ROSE: Yeah, but yours looks like a big blue box. No one's going to"
147,notice. 
148,"DOCTOR: You'd be surprised. Emergency like this, there'll be all kinds"
149,of people watching. Trust me. The Tardis stays where it is. 
150,ROSE: So history's happening and we're stuck here. 
151,"DOCTOR: Yes, we are. "
152,"MAN: It's got to be Ken Livingstone, hasn't it. "
153,ROSE: We could always do what everybody else does. We could watch it on
154,TV.

156,[The Tyler's flat]
157,
158,(News 24 is on the scene.) 
159,REPORTER : Big Ben destroyed as a UFO crash lands in Central
160,London. Police reinforcements are drafted in from across the country to

166,(US news channel AMNN.) 
167,WOMAN [on TV]: The military are on the lookout for more spaceships.
168,"Until then, all flights in North American air space have been grounded."
169,
170,(Back to News 24.) 
171,HITCHINSON [on TV]: The army are sending divers into the wreck of the
172,spaceship. No one knows what they're going to find. 
173,(AMNN) 
174,WOMAN [on TV]: The President will address the nation live from the
175,"White House, but the Secretary General has asked that people watch the"
176,skies. 
177,"(Jackie brings in a mug for Rose and her friend Ru Chan, but not the"
178,Doctor.) 
179,JACKIE: I've got no choice. 
180,RU: You've broken your mother's heart. 
181,JACKIE: I'm not going to make him welcome. 
182,RU: I cradled her like a child. 
183,"DOCTOR: Oi, I'm trying to listen. "
184,(Cut to outside 10 Downing Street.) 
185,REPORTER : His current whereabouts. News is just coming in. We can
186,go to Tom at the Embankment. 
187,"HITCHINSON [on TV]: They've found a body. It's unconfirmed, "
188,[Embankment]
189,
190,HITCHINSON: But I'm being told a body has been
191,found in the wreckage. A body of non-terrestrial origins. It's being
192,brought ashore.
193,
194,[The Tyler's flat]
195,
196,(The gathering is turning into a welcome home party
197,"for Rose, with wine being served.) "
198,HITCHINSON [on TV]: A body of some sort has been found inside the
199,wreckage of the spacecraft. 
200,"JACKIE: Oh, guess who asked me out. Billy Crewe. "
201,HITCHINSON [on TV]: Brought to the nearest shore. Unconfirmed reports
202,say that the body is of extra-terrestrial origin. An extraordinary
203,event unfolding here live here in Central London. The body is being
204,"transferred to a secure unit mortuary, the whereabouts is yet unknown."
205,The roads in Central London are being 
206,(The channel changes to Blue Peter.) 
207,"MATT BAKER [on TV]: And when you've stuck your fins on, you can cover"
208,the whole lot in buttercream. 
209,"(A toddler is on the Doctor's lap, wrestling for the remote.) "
210,"MATT BAKER [on TV]: Oh, look at that. Then ice it any colour you want."
211,"Here's one I made a little bit earlier. And look at that, your very own"
212,spaceship ready to eat. And for something a little extra special 
213,(News 24 returns.) 
214,HITCHINSON : Albion Hospital. We still don't know whether it's
215,alive or dead. Whitehall is denying everything. 
216,[Outside the hospital]
217,
218,"HITCHINSON: But the body has been brought here,"
219,Albion Hospital. The road's closed off. It's the closest to the river.
220,
221,[The Tyler's flat]
222,
223,DOCTOR: Go on. 
224,HITCHINSON [on TV]: I'm being told that General Asquith is now entering
225,the hospital. The building's been evacuated. The patients have been
226,moved out onto the 
227,[Outside the hospital]
228,
229,HITCHINSON: Streets. The police still won't confirm
230,the presence of an alien body contained inside those walls.
231,
232,[Mortuary]
233,
234,(The General marches along the corridor with an
235,"escort, and into the room where a dainty oriental physician is in"
236,attendance of a large lump under a white sheet.) 
237,"ASQUITH: Let's have a look, then. "
238,(She pulls back the sheet. Everyone say Hi to Naoko
239,Mori.)
240,
241,"ASQUITH: Good God. And that's real? It's not a hoax or a dummy, or a "
242,SATO: I've x-rayed the skull. It's wired up inside like nothing I've
243,ever seen before. No one could make this up. 
244,"ASQUITH: We've got experts being flown in. Until they arrive, get that"
245,out of sight. 
246,(The body is placed into Body Cold Chamber number 5.) 
247,[Corridor]
248,
249,"SATO: Excuse me, sir? I know it's a state of"
250,"emergency and there's a lot of rumour flying around, but is it true"
251,what they're saying about the Prime Minister?
252,
253,[The Tyler's flat]
254,
255,(Reporting from outside Number 10.) 
256,ANDREW MARR [on TV]: Mystery still surrounds there whereabouts of the
257,Prime Minister. He's not been seen since the emergency began. The
258,"opposition are criticising his lack of leadership, and. Hold on. "
259,(An official car pulls up and a portly man gets out.) 
260,"ANDREW MARR [on TV]: Oh, that's Joseph Green, MP for Hartley Dale. He's"
261,Chairman of the Parliamentary Commission 
262,[Downing Street]
263,
264,ANDREW MARR: On the monitoring of sugar standards
265,"in exported confectionary. With respect, hardly the most important"
266,person right now.
267,
268,[Entrance hall]
269,
270,"GANESH: Indra Ganesh, sir. Junior secretary with"
271,the MOD. I'll be your liaison. 
272,GREEN: Where the hell is he? 
273,"GANESH: If we could talk in private, sir. Follow me upstairs. "
274,HARRIET: Excuse me! Harriet Jones. MP for Flydale North. 
275,"GANESH: I'm sorry, can it wait? "
276,HARRIET: But I did have an appointment at 3:15. 
277,"GANESH: Yes, and a spaceship crashed in the middle of London. I think"
278,the schedule might have changed. 
279,(The men head up the stairs.) 
280,[Grand staircase]
281,
282,"GANESH: You've heard about the alien body, sir? "
283,"GREEN: Never mind that, where is he? Where's the Prime Minister? "
284,"GANESH: No one knows, sir. He's disappeared. I have to inform you that"
285,"with the city gridlocked and the Cabinet stranded outside London, that"
286,makes you acting Prime Minister with immediate effect. 
287,"GREEN: Oh, Lord. Oh, hold on. (fart!) Pardon me. It's just a nervous"
288,stomach. Anyway.
289,
290,[Outer office]
291,
292,(A well-built man and woman are here.) 
293,GANESH: Margaret Blaine. She's with MI5. 
294,"MARGARET: There's no more information, sir. I personally escorted the"
295,Prime Minister from the cabinet room to his car. This is Oliver
296,"Charles, transport liaison. "
297,"CHARLES: The car's disappeared. There's no record of it, sir. It"
298,literally vanished. 
299,GREEN: Right. Inside. Tell me everything. 
300,"GANESH: Er, sir? "
301,(Ganesh holds out a Ministerial Red Box.) 
302,GANESH: The emergency protocols. Detailing the actions to be taken by
303,the government of Great Britain in the event of an alien incursion. 
304,GREEN: Right. Good. (fart!) Blimey. Pardon me. 
305,(Green takes the Red Box.) 
306,"GREEN: Let's work, eh? "
307,(Green follows Margaret and Charles into the Cabinet Room and puts the
308,Box down on the table. They all start laughing.) 
309,[Outside the Tyler's flat]
310,
311,ROSE: And where do you think you're going? 
312,DOCTOR: Nowhere. It's just a bit human in there for me. History just
313,happened and they're talking about where you can buy dodgy top-up cards
314,"for half price. I'm off on a wander, that's all. "
315,ROSE: Right. There's a spaceship on the Thames and you're just
316,wandering. 
317,DOCTOR: Nothing to do with me. It's not an invasion. That was a genuine
318,"crash landing. Angle of descent, colour of smoke, everything. It's"
319,perfect. 
320,ROSE: So? 
321,DOCTOR: So maybe this is it. First contact. The day mankind officially
322,comes into contact with an alien race. I'm not interfering because
323,you've got to handle this on your own. That's when the human race
324,finally grows up. Just this morning you were all tiny and small and
325,made of clay. Now you can expand. 
326,(David Bowie is singing Starman in the background.) 
327,DOCTOR: You don't need me. Go and celebrate history. Spend some time
328,with your mum. 
329,ROSE: Promise you won't disappear? 
330,DOCTOR: Tell you what. Tardis key. It's about time you had one. See you
331,later.
332,
333,[Powell Estate]
334,
335,"WOMAN: Oi, gorgeous! Come back and join the party! "
336,(Mickey has gone out onto his balcony to check on the state of his
337,"trainers, and sees the Doctor walking back to the Tardis.) "
338,MICKEY: Oh my God! 
339,(Mickey runs out of his flat as the Doctor goes inside the Tardis. It
340,dematerialises.) 
341,"MICKEY: Wait, Doctor! Doctor! "
342,(Mickey crashes full pelt into the corrugated iron shutters of the
343,empty shop behind where the Tardis was parked. He tries to walk away
344,nonchalantly. 
345,(The Tardis is not happy in flight. The Doctor resorts to a large
346,hammer to sort things out.)
347,
348,[Outer office]
349,
350,(The MP for Flydale North brings the Junior
351,Secretary a cup.) 
352,HARRIET: I bet no one's bought you a coffee. 
353,GANESH: Thank you. 
354,HARRIET: Pleasure. 
355,GANESH: You still can't go in. 
356,HARRIET: Damn. You've seen through my cunning plan. 
357,"GANESH: Look, I'm sorry. It's just impossible. "
358,HARRIET: Not even for two minutes? I don't get many chances to walk
359,"these corridors. I'm hardly one of the Babes, just a faithful back"
360,bencher. And I know we've had a brave new world land right on our
361,"doorstep, and that's wonderful. I think that's probably wonderful."
362,"Nevertheless, ordinary life keeps ticking away. I need to enter this"
363,paper. 
364,(The trio leave the Cabinet Room.) 
365,"HARRIET: Oh, Mister Green, sir. I know you're busy, but could you put"
366,this on the next Cabinet agenda? 
367,GREEN: What is it? 
368,HARRIET: Cottage hospitals. I've worked out a system whereby cottage
369,hospitals do not have to be excluded from centers of excellence. You
370,"see, my mother's in the Flydale infirmary. That's my constituency. Tiny"
371,"little place, you wouldn't know it, but it's given me a chance to "
372,"GREEN: By all the saints, get some perspective, woman! I'm busy. "
373,(Ganesh grabs his jacket and follows the trio out. Harriet goes into
374,the Cabinet Room and closes the door. She puts her proposal in the Red
375,Box then notices the Emergency Protocols file inside it. She sits down
376,and starts reading.)
377,
378,[Albion Hospital]
379,
380,(Doctor Sato is looking over her notes when she
381,hears a thumping noise coming from
382,Body Cold Chamber number 5. 
383,"(The Tardis, meanwhile, has parked herself in a store room. The Doctor"
384,uses his sonic screwdriver on the door lock.) 
385,DOCTOR: Shush! 
386,"(Toshiko moves towards the chamber, and the thumping turns into a"
387,knocking.)
388,
389,[Meeting room]
390,
391,(The Doctor walks into a room full of Red Berets -
392,the Parachute Regiment. They stare at each other in silence for a
393,"moment, then the soldiers grab their weapons and point them at the"
394,"Doctor. Something bursts out of the cooler, and Toshiko screams."
395,Everyone hears it.) 
396,DOCTOR: Defence plan delta! Come on. Move! Move! 
397,(He leads the Marines out of the room at the double.)
398,
399,[Mortuary]
400,
401,(Toshiko is cowering by her desk. She has a cut on
402,her head.) 
403,SATO: It's alive! 
404,DOCTOR: Spread out. Tell the perimeter it's a lockdown. 
405,SATO: My god. It's still alive. 
406,DOCTOR: Do it!

408,
409,"SOLDIER: Mick, Terry, side rooms. Now! "
410,SOLDIER 2: Clear! 
411,SOLDIER 3: Front clear!

416,
417,SATO: I swear it was dead. 
418,"DOCTOR: Coma, shock, hibernation, anything. What does it look like? "
419,(Metal clattering.) 
420,DOCTOR: It's still here. 
421,(The Doctor gestures to a soldier outside the door to come in and kneel
422,by
423,Toshiko. Behind a filing cabinet is - a pig?) 
424,DOCTOR: Hello. 
425,(The pig runs out on its hind legs. It is wearing a spacesuit.) 
426,DOCTOR: Don't shoot!
427,
428,[Corridor]
429,
430,(Another soldier shoots the pig.) 
431,DOCTOR: What did you do that for? It was scared! It was scared.
432,
433,[Cabinet Room]
434,
435,ASQUITH : I've got the White House phoning me
436,direct because Downing Street won't answer their calls. This is
437,outrageous! We haven't even started the vaccination programme. This is
438,appalling. The nations of the world are watching the United Kingdom. 
439,(Harriet packs away the documents and runs to the door to see the
440,General berating the Trio in the outer office. She looks for somewhere
441,to hide.) 
442,"GREEN : Well, it has all been a bit of a shock. "
443,ASQUITH : This is the greatest crisis in modern history and you've
444,"done nothing. Your behaviour has been shameful, sir. You're supposed to"
445,be in charge. We need positive leadership. The capital's ground to a
446,halt. 
447,(Harriet disappears into a cupboard just as they enter.) 
448,"ASQUITH: Furthermore, we can only assume that the Prime Minister's"
449,"disappearance is the direct result of hostile alien action, and what"
450,have you been doing? Nothing. 
451,GREEN: Sorry. Sorry. I thought I was Prime Minister now. 
452,ASQUITH: Only by default. 
453,"GREEN: Oh, that's not fair. I've been having such fun. "
454,ASQUITH: You think this is fun? 
455,"GREEN: It's a hoot, this job. "
456,"MARGARET: Honestly, it's super. "
457,(Fart!) 
458,"CHARLES: Oh, excuse me. (Fart!) Oh! "
459,"(The trio laugh, and fart almost continuously from now on. Very"
460,juvenile.) 
461,ASQUITH: What's going on here? Where's the rest of the cabinet? Why
462,haven't they been airlifted in? 
463,"GREEN: I cancelled it. They'd only get in the way. Oh, there I go. "
464,"MARGARET: Oh, and me! I'm shaking my booty. "
465,"ASQUITH: Sir! Under Section Five of the emergency protocols, it is my"
466,"duty to relieve you of command. And by God, I'll put this country under"
467,marshal law if I have to. 
468,"GREEN: Oh, I'm scared. I mean, that's hair-raising. I mean, literally."
469,Look! 
470,"(Green unzips his forehead, and a blue light pours out. Margaret and"
471,"Charles do the same. Harriet watches, horrified, as we hear blubbery,"

476,"SATO: I just assumed that's what aliens look like,"
477,but you're saying it's an ordinary pig from Earth. 
478,DOCTOR: More like a mermaid. Victorian showmen used to draw the crowds
479,"by taking the skull of a cat, gluing it to a fish and calling it a"
480,"mermaid. Now someone's taken a pig, opened up it's brain, stuck bits"
481,"on, then they've strapped it in that ship and made it dive bomb. It"
482,must've been terrified. They've taken this animal and turned it into a
483,joke. 
484,"SATO: So it's a fake, a pretend, like the mermaid. But the technology"
485,"augmenting its brain, it's like nothing on Earth. It's alien. Aliens"
486,are faking aliens. But why would they do that? Doctor?

638,See? The spaceship did a sling shot round the Earth before it landed.

811,"you, the ship had one porcine occupant. "
812,"DOCTOR: Of course, the really interesting bit happened three days ago,"
813,"see, filed away under Any Other Business. The North Sea. A satellite"
814,"detected a signal, a little blip of radiation, at one hundred fathoms,"
815,like there's something down there. You were just about to investigate
816,"and the next thing you know, this happens. Spaceships, pigs, massive"
817,diversion. From what?
818,
819,[Cabinet Room]
820,
821,HARRIET: They turned the body into a suit. A
822,disguise for the thing inside! 
823,"ROSE: It's all right. I believe you. It's, it's alien. They must have"
824,"some serious technology behind this. If we could find it, we could use"
