21,Christmas Day

23,
24,[Village]
25,
26,(Two moons shine through wispy clouds in a night sky as we fly over a
27,"snow-covered landscape and a large red flying saucer, to a village, as"
28,an orchestra and choir gives us that excellent Christmas hymn by
29,Charles Wesley to the tune by Felix Mendelssohn. In a street looking
30,"remarkably like Trap Street but with extra cheeriness and lights, the"
31,"Tardis is being quietly covered with the falling snow, and has some"
32,icicles hanging from it. There is a notice fastened to the door - Carol
33,Singers Will Be Criticised. A man in a red duffel
34,coat and woolly bobble hat approaches the Mathiesa Boutique and turns
35,"left, looking at a piece of paper and muttering to himself.)"
36,CHOIR : ♫ Hark! The Herald Angels sing. Glory to the newborn king!
37,"Peace on earth and mercy mild. God and sinners reconciled. Joyful, all"
38,"ye nations, rise. Join the triumph of the skies. ♫ "
39,NARDOLE: Nothing there. 
40,"(He turns around and sees the Tardis, then checks his piece of paper.)"
41,NARDOLE: Ooo! This must be it. 
42,(He goes up to the Tardis and knocks on the door. The Doctor answers
43,it. He had two felt antlers sticking straight up on the top of his
44,head.)
45,DOCTOR: Is there anything on my head? 
46,"NARDOLE: Er, well, yes. "
47,DOCTOR: Describe it. 
48,"NARDOLE: Well, you've sort of got antlers. "
49,DOCTOR: Antlers? 
50,"NARDOLE: Yes, antlers. "
51,DOCTOR: Antlers! Hmm. 
52,"(The Doctor goes back inside, leaving the door slightly ajar.)"
53,DOCTOR : You are a time-space machine. You're a vehicle! I've never
54,asked you to cheer me up with hologrammatic antlers! 
55,(The Tardis makes a brief engine noise.)
56,DOCTOR : Thank you. 
57,"(The Doctor returns, minus the antlers.)"
58,DOCTOR: Can I help you? 
59,NARDOLE: Yes. Are you the surgeon? 
60,DOCTOR: Close enough. Why? 
61,"NARDOLE: Well, you know. "
62,DOCTOR: I don't know. 
63,NARDOLE: There's a medical emergency. 
64,(Nardole turns and starts to walk away.)
65,DOCTOR: Will there be singing? 
66,NARDOLE: No. 
67,"DOCTOR: Fine, then. "
68,(The Doctor closes the Tardis door and follows Nardole.)
69,NARDOLE: We weren't sure where you'd come down. 
70,DOCTOR: Sorry? 
71,NARDOLE: In your capsule. 
72,DOCTOR: I'm never sure. I don't like being sure about things. One
73,"minute you're sure, the next everybody turns into lizards and a piano"
74,falls on you. 
75,NARDOLE: A piano? 
76,DOCTOR: It's been a long day. 
77,"(They walk down the street, past all the lights and decorations."
78,Another man carrying a medical bag comes out of a side street and
79,speaks to a passing woman.)
80,SURGEON: Are you expecting a surgeon? 
81,DOCTOR: So what's the medical emergency? 
82,NARDOLE: Didn't you read the agreement? 
83,
84,[Outside the saucer]
85,
86,(They have passed the white painted fence denoting the edge of the
87,village.)
88,NARDOLE: There it is. 
89,DOCTOR: What? 
90,NARDOLE: There. That's it. 
91,"DOCTOR: That's what? Oh, the flying saucer. Is that new? "
92,"(A door in the saucer opens, back-lighting a figure in a white fur"
93,"trimmed hooded red floor-length cloak, who walks forward down the ramp"
94,to meet them. Note - although this person's face is partially
95,"obscured by the hood, her voice is instantly recognisable to us.)"
96,NARDOLE: Come on. 
97,"RIVER: Well, you took your time. "
98,"NARDOLE: (bowing) Sorry, ma'am. This is him. This is the surgeon. "
99,DOCTOR: Hello. 
100,RIVER: You don't look much like your pictures. 
101,"DOCTOR: Well, that's an ongoing problem for me. "
102,"RIVER: Doesn't look very impressive, does he? Nardole, what have"
103,you brought to my doorstep? 
104,DOCTOR: I've had a haircut. This is my best suit. 
105,RIVER: It's not even a suit. 
106,DOCTOR: Do I know you? 
107,RIVER: You most certainly do not. 
108,(She throws back the hood. The Doctor smiles broadly.)
109,"RIVER: And now that you've met me, you'll do your very best to forget"
110,me. 
111,DOCTOR: River! 
112,"NARDOLE: Oi! Doctor Song to you. Sometimes Professor, but mainly"
113,Doctor. 
114,RIVER: Don't use my name. Ever. How do you know me? 
115,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a tiny bit complicated. People usually need a"
116,flowchart. 
117,"RIVER: It doesn't matter. If either of you use my name again, I will"
118,remove your organs in alphabetical order. Any questions? 
119,"DOCTOR: Which alphabet? (grin fades) Sorry, you really didn't want"
120,"these questions, did you? "
121,RIVER: This way. We don't have a lot of time. 
122,(She leads the way into the saucer.)
123,DOCTOR: What seems to be the problem? 
124,RIVER: My husband. 
125,DOCTOR: Your husband? 
126,"RIVER: Didn't you read my message? My husband, yes. My husband is"
127,dying. 
128,(The Doctor stands still.)
129,NARDOLE: Something wrong? 
130,DOCTOR: I think I'm going to need a bigger flowchart. 
131,
132,[Saucer chamber]
133,
134,(Plainsong is being sung somewhere as
135,River enters the main chamber.)
136,"RIVER: Husband, I return to you. "
137,(Cloaked figures start to draw swords from scabbards slung across their
138,"backs, then return them to their resting places.)"
139,HYDROFLAX: Where is my queen? 
140,"RIVER: Never far from you, my love. "
141,HYDROFLAX: Ah. 
142,"(Hydraulic servos move, and we see a small male head where the neck"
143,should be on a huge red armoured figure lying on a table.)
144,"DOCTOR: No, wait. That's your husband? "
145,"RIVER: Listen, you are being watched by four billion people. "
146,(There are screens recessed into the walls around the chamber.)
147,"RIVER: You are surrounded by warrior monks with sentient laser swords,"
148,genetically engineered
149,anger problems and not enough to do. Best just stay still and keep your
150,hands by your side. 
151,"DOCTOR: No, wait. That's your husband? "
152,"RIVER: My husband, your patient. King Hydroflax. "
153,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's who you're married to? Not anybody else? "
154,"HYDROFLAX: My love, attend me, woman! "
155,RIVER: I fly to you. Is there a problem? 
156,"DOCTOR: Right. So you don't recognise me, then? "
157,RIVER: Why would I recognise you? 
158,"DOCTOR: Oh, no reason. "
159,(River goes to Hydroflax and caresses his armour. Nardole stands next
160,"to the Doctor, who has crossed his arms.)"
161,DOCTOR: I don't like him. Do you like him? 
162,NARDOLE: Don't cross your arms. 
163,DOCTOR: He's a lying down person. I don't like lying down people. It's
164,so untidy. 
165,"NARDOLE: Keep your arms by your side, like she said. "
166,RIVER: My one true love. The only husband I will ever have. 
167,(The Doctor rolls his eyes and crosses his arms. Nardole nudges him and
168,he drops them by his side again.)
169,RIVER: My time with you has been too short. 
170,HYDROFLAX: You have given me days of adventure
171,and many nights of passion. 
172,"DOCTOR: Oh, oh. "
173,NARDOLE: Why do you keep crossing them? 
174,"DOCTOR: Because they cross, I've got cross arms. "
175,HYDROFLAX: The end is near. I feel it. 
176,"RIVER: Forgive me, my lord. I have acted against your instructions. "
177,HYDROFLAX: My love? 
178,"RIVER: If you die this day, this galaxy will drown any tears. Oh, look"
179,"at them, your people! They watch and hope and pray. With so much at"
180,"stake, I followed"
181,my heart. I disobeyed your orders and sent for the finest surgeon in
182,the galaxy! 
183,"(The crowds on the screens cheer and applaud. The Doctor looks around,"
184,and River holds out her hand to him. Nardole chuckles and punches the
185,Doctor lightly on the arm.)
186,"DOCTOR: (sotto) This might be an alarming question in the circumstance,"
187,"but you really do think I'm a surgeon, don't you? "
188,NARDOLE: Oh. 
189,"DOCTOR: (sotto) Okay, calm down, keep it together. Don't make puddles. "
190,"RIVER: Surgeon, attend your patient. "
191,"(Nardole looks very worried, and whimpers.)"
192,DOCTOR: (sotto) Any tiny hint of species he might be? 
193,(Nardole whimpers I dunno.)
194,"DOCTOR: (sotto) Okay, never mind. You just stay there. (to a monk next"
195,to them.) You're probably going to need a mop. 
196,(The Doctor goes to Hydroflax's side.)
197,RIVER: Bow. 
198,"DOCTOR: Sorry, what? "
199,"RIVER: You are in the presence of his Infinite Majesty, King Hydroflax."
200,You will bow. 
201,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't do that. "
202,(Nardole is seriously cacking himself now.)
203,RIVER: You what? 
204,DOCTOR: It's my back. 
205,RIVER: Your back? 
206,"DOCTOR: Yeah, my back's playing up. It simply refuses to carry the"
207,weight of an entirely pointless stratum of society
208,who contribute nothing of worth to the world and crush the hopes and
209,dreams of working people. 
210,"HYDROFLAX: Can you save me, Surgeon? "
211,"DOCTOR: Well, that depends upon what's wrong with you. "
212,RIVER: There's something in his brain. 
213,DOCTOR: You could have fooled me. 
214,(Hydroflax gets angry.)
215,"DOCTOR: Oh, oh, sorry. "
216,(River placates Hydroflax by massaging his face vigorously.)
217,"DOCTOR: Sorry, just gallows humour. Probably the wrong word. "
218,"NARDOLE: Yeah, I would say it is. "
219,"RIVER: My love, you must rest. The surgeon and I will discuss the"
220,"procedure. Prepare, master of my life, to live anew. "
221,(She plants a long sloppy kiss on Hydroflax's forehead.)
222,RIVER: Patience be with you all. Our King will rise again! 
223,NARDOLE + CROWDS: Our King will rise again. 
224,(River gestures to the Doctor to follow her out of the chamber.)
225,CROWDS: Our King will rise again! Hydroflax! Hydroflax! 
226,
227,[Saucer room]
228,
229,(The doors close.)
230,"DOCTOR: All right, enough of this. The joke's over. "
231,RIVER: What joke? 
232,DOCTOR: Look at me. 
233,RIVER: Why? 
234,DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. 
235,"RIVER: You'd better be, you've got an operation to perform. "
236,(She activates a massive hologram of Hydroflax's head.)
237,"RIVER: Here's the entry wound, just below the hairline. And"
238,"there's the projectile. It should have killed him straight off, but"
239,he's very strong. 
240,DOCTOR: It's not a bullet. 
241,RIVER: It's a diamond. 
242,DOCTOR: How did it get in there? 
243,RIVER: At speed. 
244,(The Doctor puts on his sonic sunglasses.)
245,RIVER: Do you recognise it? 
246,DOCTOR: No! 
247,RIVER: Yes. 
248,DOCTOR: The Halassi Androvar. 
249,RIVER: The very same. Hydroflax was leading a raid on the Halassi
250,"vaults. In the ensuing fire-fight, the whole thing blew up in his face,"
251,with the result that he now has the most valuable diamond in the
252,universe lodged three inches inside his enormous head. 
253,(The Doctor reaches into the hologram and manipulates the holo-diamond.)
254,"RIVER: So, can you remove it? "
255,DOCTOR: It's very small. It might be difficult to manoeuvre it. 
256,RIVER: Not the diamond. His head.
257,DOCTOR: His head? 
258,(The Doctor removes his sunglasses and stares at River.)
259,"RIVER: Yes. I think it would be easier just to remove the whole thing,"
260,don't you? 
261,DOCTOR: Wouldn't that kill him? 
262,"RIVER: You're the medical expert, but I'd say so, yes. "
263,DOCTOR: Your husband? 
264,RIVER: Sort of. 
265,DOCTOR: Sort of? 
266,RIVER: I basically married the diamond. The Halassi want their diamond
267,"back, so they came to me. "
268,DOCTOR: Why? 
269,RIVER: I'm an archaeologist. 
270,DOCTOR: Slash murderer slash thief. 
271,RIVER: An archaeologist is just
272,a thief. With patience. 
273,"(She empties a zippered bag, throwing out a red fez and a bronze plate.)"
274,"RIVER: Never had much of that. It'll fit in here, don't you think? I've"
275,checked it for leaks. 
276,DOCTOR: Is this what you're like when I'm not
277,RIVER: Not what? 
278,DOCTOR: You're talking about murdering someone. 
279,"RIVER: No, I'm not. I'm actually murdering someone. Cheer up, get a"
280,"saw, I'll kill the lights, you kill the patient. I employed you. You"
281,"agreed to this. Do you not know who that man is? King Hydroflax, the"
282,"butcher of the Bone Meadows, who ends his battles by eating his"
283,"enemies, dead or alive. The murder of a creature like that wouldn't"
284,"weigh heavily on my conscience, even if I had one. What's that face?"
285,"Are you thinking? Stop it. You're a man, it looks weird. "
286,DOCTOR: I need more information. 
287,RIVER: For what? 
288,DOCTOR: For my diagnosis. 
289,RIVER: He's dying. We're about to steal his head and scoop out his
290,brains. Aren't we over-thinking? 
291,DOCTOR: I'll be the judge of that. I'm the Doctor. 
292,RIVER: You know who you remind me of? 
293,"DOCTOR: Yes, probably a chap with a big "
294,RIVER: My second wife. 
295,(The hologram of his head is replaced by the entire actual Hydroflax.
296,The monks with him all draw their swords.)
297,RIVER: Darling! You're up and about! 
298,HYDROFLAX: False wife! 
299,RIVER: How much better you're looking! 
300,HYDROFLAX: You plan to take my head. 
301,RIVER: Never crossed my mind. Is this your bag? 
302,(She gives the bag to the Doctor.)
303,HYDROFLAX: Perhaps you should have just asked. 
304,(Hydroflax's three-fingered right hand turns his head to the side then
305,"pulls it off its attachment and lowers it onto the table, then the body"
306,stomps two paces back.)
307,RIVER: Well! I wondered why we didn't share a bathroom. 
308,DOCTOR: You married a cyborg and you didn't even know it. 
309,HYDROFLAX: I'll have you flogged and flayed and burnt. I will crush
310,every last remnant of you from this universe. 
311,RIVER: How dare you! I'm your wife. 
312,HYDROFLAX: You planned to murder me! 
313,RIVER: Don't change the subject. 
314,HYDROFLAX: Why are you doing this? Who are
315,you? 
316,RIVER: I'm Professor River Song. You have an ancient artefact of great
317,"value to good people, and whatever it takes, I'm going to bring it home"
318,to them.
319,"You have stolen so much from so many, King Hydroflax, and I'm the woman"
320,who's going to steal it all back. 
321,HYDROFLAX: What are you?! 
322,RIVER: I'm an archaeologist. Look! I've got a trowel. 
323,(She pulls a trowel from her tool belt. It whirs as she uses it to zap
324,"the monk's swords, then attack Hydroflax's body.)"
325,"RIVER: Ha, ha, ha! "
326,(The Doctor picks up Hydroflax's head.)
327,"DOCTOR: Do not harm her! If you know what's good for you, do not lay a"
328,finger on that woman. 
329,HYDROFLAX: Ignore him. Attack! 
330,(River keeps using her sonic trowel on the cyborg while the Doctor
331,opens the garbage disposal chute.)
332,"DOCTOR: Garbage disposal, right? Get ready to say whee! "
333,HYDROFLAX: Put me down. 
334,DOCTOR: Back off from River Song. Give the order now. Get yourself
335,under control. 
336,HYDROFLAX: Do not attack the female. 
337,"(River runs to the Doctor's side, grabbing the bag, and points her"
338,trowel at Hydroflax's head.)
339,"RIVER: Nobody move, or the head gets it."
340,DOCTOR: Do you really have a shooty trowel? 
341,RIVER: It's sonic. 
342,DOCTOR: Sonic trowel. You realise how ridiculous that sounds? 
343,HYDROFLAX: Their threats are empty. Destroy them! 
344,(Hydroflax's body speaks. Lights flash on its torso as it does.)
345,CYBORG: Negative. Seventy eight percent chance of significant tissue
346,damage. 
347,HYDROFLAX: Do as you're told! 
348,"CYBORG: Decision overruled. Recommendation, chill. "
349,"DOCTOR: Look at that, your body's got a mind of its own. "
350,RIVER: More like an onboard computer for the cybernetic component. 
351,DOCTOR: Plus in-built flash drive and vernacular friendly interface. 
352,RIVER: Cyber co-pilot. 
353,DOCTOR: Mobile life support. 
354,RIVER: Sexy. 
355,DOCTOR: It's not sexy. 
356,RIVER: Absolutely sexy. 
357,DOCTOR: Why is everything sexy now? 
358,RIVER: Speaking of which.
359,(She uses her wrist comms.)
360,"RIVER: Ramone, prep for emergency extraction. Two to go. "
361,RAMONE : Standing by for teleport. 
362,RIVER: Put it in the bag. 
363,DOCTOR: Sorry? 
364,RIVER: The head. Put it in the bag. 
365,HYDROFLAX: Do not put me in the bag. 
366,"RIVER: Quickly, do it. Ramone, twenty seconds to jump. "
367,HYDROFLAX: I will not be placed into a bag! 
368,DOCTOR: Stop shouting a minute if you want to go face-up. 
369,(The Doctor puts Hydroflax into the bag.)
370,HYDROFLAX: You will be crushed! You will be destroyed! You will beg my
371,infinite mercy! 
372,"RIVER: Oh, zip it! "
373,(The Doctor zips up the bag.)
374,"RIVER: Try to follow me and I'll put him in a blender. Ramone, now. "
375,"(The Doctor, River and the bag are teleported away.)"
376,CYBORG: They will be tracked. They will be found. 
377,
378,[Mendorax Dellora] 
379,
380,(The Doctor and River's feet are two feet or so off the ground when
381,"they materialise, and fall.)"
382,BOTH: Argh! Oh! 
383,"RIVER: Ramone! Just once, can you get the height right? "
384,"RAMONE : Sorry, Professor."
385,"HYDROFLAX [in bag] : When I escape, I will bring terror to you and your"
386,family. There is no escape from the 
387,RIVER: Home in on my signal. Get a shift on. Can you locate the Damsel?
388,RAMONE : I'm on it. The capsule is really close. 
389,"(The Doctor is lying in the snow, laughing.)"
390,RIVER: Is something funny? 
391,HYDROFLAX [in bag]: Who dares laugh at Hydroflax? You shall be crushed!
392,You shall scream in fear! Let me out of this bag! 
393,RIVER: This is a serious mission in a critical phase. There is nothing
394,to laugh about here. 
395,DOCTOR: We're being threatened by a bag! By a head in a bag! 
396,HYDROFLAX [in bag]: I shall make dust of you. My enemies are meat for
397,the devouring! 
398,"DOCTOR: I can't approve of any of this, you know, but I haven't laughed"
399,in a long time. 
400,"RIVER: Well, good for you. "
401,HYDROFLAX [in bag]: Prepare to die in agony and submit to my supremacy!
402,Unzip this bag! 
403,(River joins in with the Doctor's laughter.)
404,"DOCTOR: You know, don't you? "
405,RIVER: Know what? 
406,DOCTOR: Stop pretending. You know who I am. 
407,RIVER: Who are you? 
408,"DOCTOR: You know who I am. It's, it's, it's me. "
409,RIVER: Great. Who are you? 
410,(A dark haired man with a short beard comes running up.)
411,"RAMONE: Professor Song! Sorry, Professor. Sorry about the height thing."
412,
413,RIVER: Prove it. 
414,(River kisses Ramone long and hard.)
415,"DOCTOR: Urgh! Doesn't it get dull after a while? As an activity, it's"
416,"not hugely varied, is it? "
417,"RIVER: I'm so sorry. This is my husband, Ramone. "
418,"DOCTOR: Another one? Are you going to kill him, too? "
419,RAMONE: We're not actually married. 
420,"RIVER: Ah, we are, in fact. I wiped it from your memory. "
421,RAMONE: Why? 
422,"RIVER: Well, you were being annoying. So, the Damsel. Do we have a fix?"
423,
424,"RAMONE: Found the capsule just over in the village, but I can't locate"
425,Damsel. I've looked everywhere. 
426,DOCTOR: Who's Damsel? 
427,"RIVER: Have you been thorough? It's not easy, you know. He does have"
428,twelve faces. 
429,(Ramone takes out a wallet and a sheaf photographs drops down. The
430,Doctor looks down them.)
431,RAMONE: None of these men are here. Are you sure it's one of these? 
432,(The Doctor looks down the photographs from Hartnell to McCoy and
433,smiles.)
434,RIVER: Yes! He only has these twelve faces. He'll be around here
435,somewhere. This is the closest intersection with the Doctor's timeline.
436,
437,"(Then carries on down past McGann, Hurt, Eccleston, Tennant and Smith,"
438,and turns over the last one. No more photographs.)
439,RIVER: That's why I crashed Hydroflax's ship here. 
440,DOCTOR: Damsel. 
441,"RAMONE: Codename, Damsel in Distress. Apparently, he needs a lot of"
442,rescuing. 
443,DOCTOR: What if he has a face that you don't know about yet? 
444,"RIVER: He has limits. Well, then, let's go find him. "
445,
446,[Saucer room]
447,
448,(Hydroflax's cybernetic body is interrogating poor Nardole.)
449,CYBORG: You are in league with the former Queen. 
450,NARDOLE: She employed me! I didn't really know anything. 
451,CYBORG: You have information. 
452,"NARDOLE: Oh, hardly anything, really. A tiny bit. "
453,CYBORG: You will give this information to us.

484,RAMONE: What if we can't find him? We need to get you off-world now. 
485,DOCTOR: Off-world. People never say that. (laughs) Are you new? 
486,RIVER: We can't hang around waiting. He could be ages. 
487,"DOCTOR: Yes, he's probably off rebuilding a civilisation or defeating"

489,(They arrive at the Tardis.)
490,RIVER: We'll just have to steal it. 
491,"DOCTOR: From the ninth dimension. Sorry, what? "
492,RAMONE: The hopper is really close. We would be out of here in less
493,than ten minutes. 
494,RIVER: I need time travel. I need this Tardis. 
495,DOCTOR: I'm sorry. The word steal. Somebody said steal. 
496,"RIVER: Yes. We're going to steal this box. Hush, you wouldn't"
497,understand. 
498,DOCTOR: You can't. 
499,RIVER: Why can't I? 
500,DOCTOR: You can't just steal a Ta. A box. 
501,RIVER: Why not? 
502,"DOCTOR: Look, it says Police. "
503,RIVER: I have a key. 
504,(River produces a Yale type key and opens the Tardis door.)
505,"DOCTOR: Okay. This er Damsel person. He sounds, he sounds pretty"
506,dangerous. Ish. 
507,"RIVER: It's a time machine. I can take it, do whatever I want for as"
508,long as I like and pop it back a second later. He'll never know it was
509,gone. 
510,"DOCTOR: Yes, he will. "
511,RIVER: How?

518,"RAMONE: Okay, but be careful. "
519,"RIVER: Absolutely not. You, with me. Bring the head. "

522,"(Ramone starts to walk away, then stops. River pops her head out of the"
523,Tardis.)
524,"RIVER: Oh, before you come in, you'd better prepare yourself for a"
525,shock. It's not as snug as it looks.

554,(The Doctor checks Hydroflax's head in the bag. The eyes are shut.)
555,"DOCTOR: It seems to have powered down, conserving batteries. It's an"
556,"in-built life-support system. I'm not sure what powers it, but "
557,RIVER: I really don't care. What's that noise? 
558,DOCTOR: I don't know. A signal? Distress call? 
559,RIVER: Homing beacon. 
560,DOCTOR: Possibly. 
561,RIVER: So the rest of him is coming?

569,RIVER: Hush. 
570,DOCTOR: You probably want to press that button. 
571,RIVER: Why? That evacuates the waste tank on deck seven. 
572,DOCTOR: Does it? 
573,RIVER: What is wrong with you? 
574,DOCTOR: Better avoid deck seven then. 
575,"RIVER: Something's interfering with the engines, which is technically"
576,not possible. 
577,DOCTOR: Maybe. 
578,RIVER: How would you know? 
579,"DOCTOR: Maybe the engines are interfering with themselves. Wild theory,"
580,"but what if this machine had certain safeguards. For instance, maybe it"
581,can't take off when a life form registers as
582,being both inside and outside
583,at the same time? 
584,RIVER: Head and body. 
585,"DOCTOR: Which would mean, and again, I'm just, I'm just wildly"
586,"theorising here, that's the door would not engage properly. "
587,RIVER: Of course. It can't seal the real-time envelope. 
588,DOCTOR: Hence it can't take off. Not when someone is in and out at the
589,same time.

658,RIVER: What sort of medical school did you go to? 
659,DOCTOR: A really good one for doctors. 
660,"HYDROFLAX: More than a power source. If necessary, a bomb. "
661,DOCTOR: So you could wipe out this solar system. 
662,HYDROFLAX: It wouldn't be the first.

664,HYDROFLAX: A fitting end for the glory of Hydroflax.

916,"FLEMMING: I do. I know River Song of old. And if you spare me, I'll"
917,tell you who she's really married to. 
918,CYBORG: Explain. 
919,FLEMMING: You need a head. I can get you a head fit for a king.

922,
923,"SCRATCH: Why do you delay? We have paid, we will receive. "
924,(The Doctor stands and takes the bag.)
925,"DOCTOR: Yes, you will. Of, by jingo, you will, yes, of course. But"
926,"obviously, we have to, you know, er, check some "
927,RIVER: Things. 
928,DOCTOR: Things. There are things that have to be checked before I get
929,"it to you. If we don't check the thing, then the, the"
930,SCRATCH: We will receive! 
931,"DOCTOR: Yes, you will receive, and here it is. Now, on its way, over"
932,this small distance. 
933,SCRATCH: We will receive! 
934,(The Doctor gives Scratch the bag.)
935,DOCTOR: Here you go. And you can have the bag as well. 
936,"RIVER: You know, it's been lovely, but er, we don't want to intrude on"
937,"this special moment, so why don't we just leave you"
938,with the new baby? 
939,SCRATCH: You will remain. 
940,RIVER: Is that strictly necessary? 
941,SCRATCH: I do not like surprises. 
942,"DOCTOR: Well, it's going to be a funny old day. Oh, boy. "
943,(Scratch starts to unzip the bag.)
944,DOCTOR: You know what? I just can't stand idly by and let this
945,continue. 
946,(He snatches back the bag and stands on a chair.)
947,"DOCTOR: Death has been done this day! Noble blood has been spilled, and"
948,"our tears will surely follow. The sky shall crack, the ground shall"
949,"heave,"
950,and even the rocks and the stones shall weep their rage. Behold! The
951,head of Hydroflax! 
952,"(He gets down, takes the head out of the bag and shows it to the"
953,"diners, who hiss.)"
954,"DOCTOR: Rest now, sweet prince. Walk amongst us nevermore. Shall we"
955,"start the bidding at two hundred billion? I'm sorry, Professor Song,"
956,but we really couldn't keep this treasure from the truly devout. 
957,"RIVER: Oh, my apologies to the truly devout. "
958,DOCTOR: And shall we find out who is the most truly devout? 
959,SCRATCH: This is heresy! 
960,RIVER: Two hundred over there. 
961,(Pointing at a bewildered man at the back.)
962,DOCTOR: Two hundred fifty million by the sweet trolley. 
963,(A woman chosen at random.)
964,SCRATCH: Silence! This is not our way. 
965,"DOCTOR: Well, it doesn't say much for your king if you can't put a"
966,price on his head. Let us see what the king himself has to say. 
967,(The Doctor jabs a knife into the head's left ear. Hydroflax wakes up
968,and screams. The diners all prostrate themselves)
969,RIVER: Quick! 
970,(She grabs the Doctor's hand and they head for the door. Flemming
971,blocks their exit.)
972,FLEMMING: Professor Song! Has the food disappointed you? 
973,"(Then the Cyborg stomps in, and the diners scream and flee. River pulls"
974,"the Doctor out of the way, but they are grabbed by security men wearing"
975,black berets.)
976,"HYDROFLAX: At last, I am whole again. Come to me, my body. "
977,(The Cyborg stomps forward then stops and scans Hydroflax's head.)
978,HYDROFLAX: Well? Put me back. 
979,CYBORG: Scan in progress. 
980,"HYDROFLAX: You don't need to scan me, just put me back. "
981,CYBORG: Tissue deterioration now irreversible. 
982,"HYDROFLAX: Well, what are you going to do about that? "
983,"CYBORG: Additional, the projectile inside your brain continues to move."
984,"Prognosis, death in seven minutes. "
985,"HYDROFLAX: Well, I refuse. King Hydroflax does not accept death. "
986,CYBORG: Orders requested. 
987,"HYDROFLAX: Whatever I need to survive, do it. Now. "
988,CYBORG: Orders accepted. You need a new head. 
989,HYDROFLAX: No! No. Not a new head! 
990,CYBORG: Orders implementing. 
991,HYDROFLAX: No. No! 
992,"(The body blasts the head into dry dark grey dust, revealing the"
993,diamond.)
994,RIVER: (to security man) I don't suppose you could fetch that over for
995,"me, could you? "
996,"FLEMMING: As I was saying, your Majesty. Well, your remaining Majesty. "
997,(Flemming snatches River's diary.)
998,"FLEMMING: If it's a new head you're after, this is the guide to the"
999,very best. 
1000,RIVER: Don't touch that. Give that back to me. 
1001,FLEMMING: The diary of River Song. The ultimate guide to the Time Lord
1002,known as the Doctor. 
1003,RIVER: Don't you dare touch that! 
1004,FLEMMING: Long live the King. 
1005,"(A short time later, as the spaceship flies through some interstellar"
1006,"debris, Flemming is walking around whilst reading the diary.)"
1007,"FLEMMING: The Pandorica Opens. Ooh, that sounds exciting. And goodness"
1008,"me, a picnic at Asgard. Some people really know"
1009,"how to snack, don't they? "
1010,RIVER: You should know I have a significant history of escaping. 
1011,FLEMMING: The Crash of the Byzantium. Didn't they make a movie of that?
1012,
1013,"RIVER: And when I do, I'm going to kill you. "
1014,"FLEMMING: Oh, Jim the Fish! (laughs) Well, we all know Jim the Fish. "
1015,"RIVER: And the longer you spend reading my diary, the longer I'm going"
1016,to take. 
1017,FLEMMING: And you've just been to Manhattan. What planet is that? 
1018,"RIVER: So do, please, keep going. "
1019,CYBORG: This is irrelevant. 
1020,"SCRATCH: If I may intrude, your Majesty. The Doctor is a legendary"
1021,"being of remarkable power and an infinite number of faces. His head, I"
1022,"assure you, would be your crowning achievement. "
1023,(Flemming taps on the Cyborg's armour to get its attention back.)
1024,"FLEMMING: Besides which, many of us on this ship would be happy to see"
1025,"his career cut off, as it were, at the neck. "
1026,"CYBORG: Proceed faster, or your"
1027,head will be taken! 
1028,SCRATCH: I would give my head with gladness. 
1029,FLEMMING: This woman is the known consort of the Doctor. 
1030,CYBORG: Confirmation required. Uploading. 
1031,"(Nardole's head rises out of the Cyborg's body, shaking and blinking in"
1032,the light.)
1033,NARDOLE: Ooo. Oh! 
1034,CYBORG: Is River Song the consort of the Time Lord known as the Doctor?
1035,
1036,"NARDOLE: Huh? I think so, yeah. Here, can I stay up for a bit? It's"
1037,really very whiffy down there. 
1038,(Nardole's head is lowered.)
1039,"NARDOLE : Oh! Oh, it's awful! "
1040,"FLEMMING: So, where is the Doctor now? "
1041,RIVER: I haven't the faintest idea. 
1042,FLEMMING: Is that credible? 
1043,RIVER: It's true. 
1044,FLEMMING: You're the woman he loves. 
1045,"RIVER: No, I'm not. "
1046,FLEMMING: She's lying. 
1047,RIVER: The Doctor does not and has never loved me. I'm not lying. 
1048,(The Cyborg scans River.)
1049,CYBORG: Confirmed. The life form is not lying. 
1050,FLEMMING: Impossible. This is a trick. 
1051,"RIVER: No, it isn't. "
1052,FLEMMING: My information is correct. You are the woman who loves the
1053,Doctor. 
1054,"RIVER: Yes, I am. I've never denied it. But whoever said he loved me"
1055,back? He's the Doctor. He doesn't go around falling in love with
1056,people.
1057,"And if you think he's anything that small or that ordinary, then you"
1058,haven't the first idea of what you're dealing with.  
1059,"FLEMMING: Your Majesty, I assure you, she is the perfect bait. When"
1060,"this woman is in danger, the Doctor will always come. "
1061,"RIVER: Oh, you are a moron. No, he won't. "
1062,FLEMMING: He's probably already here. 
1063,"RIVER: No, he isn't. Of course he isn't! "
1064,FLEMMING: Possibly on this ship. 
1065,"RIVER: Well, go on, scan it then. Go on, why don't you? "
1066,DOCTOR: River 
1067,"RIVER: Two hearts, stupid clothes, you can't miss him. "
1068,DOCTOR: River. 
1069,"RIVER: Go on, scan the whole parsec! He's not here. God knows where he"
1070,"is right now, but I promise you, he's doing whatever the hell he wants"
1071,and not giving a damn about me! And I'm just fine with that. 
1072,DOCTOR: River 
1073,"RIVER: When you love the Doctor, it's like loving the stars themselves."
1074,You don't expect a sunset to admire you back. And if I happen to find
1075,myself
1076,"in danger, let me tell you, the Doctor is not stupid enough, or"
1077,"sentimental enough, and he is certainly not in love enough to find"
1078,himself
1079,standing in it with me! 
1080,(She meets the Doctor's eyes. He smiles and the penny finally drops for
1081,her. Long pause.)
1082,"DOCTOR: (sotto) Hello, sweetie. "
1083,RIVER: You are so doing those roots. 
1084,"DOCTOR: What, the roots of the sunset? "
1085,RIVER: Don't you dare. 
1086,DOCTOR: I'll have to check with the stars themselves. 
1087,"RIVER: Oh, shut up. I was just keeping them talking till it kicks off. "
1088,CYBORG: What is this conversation? Explain. 
1089,RIVER: You keep out of this. 
1090,DOCTOR: We need to get to work. 
1091,"RIVER: Okay, what have you got? "
1092,"DOCTOR: Four exits. Two concealed, one in the ceiling. "
1093,RIVER: There's also one in the floor. 
1094,"DOCTOR: No, I don't like it. "
1095,RIVER: Too close to the engine ducts? 
1096,DOCTOR: A bit too tight. 
1097,"RIVER: Oh, I hope you're not being personal. "
1098,"FLEMMING: Excuse me, what are you talking about? "
1099,"RIVER: Hush, Mummy and Daddy are busy. "
1100,(A clock chimes the hour.)
1101,RIVER: There we are. Two o'clock. Here we go. 
1102,CYBORG: Cease this conversation. 
1103,"RIVER: Darling, in the event of a sudden meteor strike on the lower"
1104,"starboard decks, where would you say is the safest place to stand? "
1105,FLEMMING: Meteor strikes? 
1106,"DOCTOR: Exactly here, I should think. "
1107,RIVER: Do you know what that isn't? A coincidence. 
1108,(Rumble.)
1109,DOCTOR: Your escape plan. 
1110,RIVER: It's cheaper than a taxi. 
1111,SCRATCH: What meteor strike? 
1112,COMPUTER: Alert. Meteor storm imminent.
1113,RIVER: That meteor strike. 
1114,FLEMMING: How could you know? 
1115,RIVER: I'm an archaeologist from the future. I dug you up. 
1116,(Boom! Shudder.)
1117,RIVER: See you in four hundred years. 
1118,"(The floor gives way below the Doctor and River, and they drop into)"
1119,
1120,[Reception area]
1121,
1122,RIVER: I had this book. History's Finest Exploding Restaurants. The
1123,best food for free. Skip the coffee. 
1124,"DOCTOR: What do you think, by the way? "
1125,RIVER: Of what? 
1126,DOCTOR: My new body. 
1127,"RIVER: Oh, I'll let you know. I've only seen the face. How have you got"
1128,"a new one, by the way? Aren't there rules? "
1129,DOCTOR: A thing happened. 
1130,RIVER: I bet it probably did. 
1131,COMPUTER: Starboard decks compromised. Please abandon ship.
1132,"(Another boom sends the diamond tumbling down, and River catches it in"
1133,her bodice.)
1134,DOCTOR: The diamond? 
1135,"RIVER: Good, aren't I? "
1136,DOCTOR: I'm not sure good's the word. 
1137,RIVER: Better not be. 
1138,DOCTOR: We need to get this ship stabilised. Where's the bridge? 
1139,RIVER: This way. 
1140,COMPUTER: Please abandon ship. Please abandon ship.
1141,(The Cyborg drops down as well.)
1142,DOCTOR: We also need to stop that. 
1143,RIVER: Toss for it. 
1144,"DOCTOR: I'll take the robot, you drive. "
1145,RIVER: Okay. 
1146,"DOCTOR: Oh, don't stop for strangers. "
1147,RIVER: Look who's talking. 
1148,(River leaves.)
1149,DOCTOR: What's the point? It's over. 
1150,CYBORG: I will take your head. 
1151,DOCTOR: What for? We're on a crashing spaceship and I don't even know
1152,if I can save it. You just shot your own king in your own face. You'd
1153,get beheaded if you had one. 
1154,CYBORG: I will take yours. King Hydroflax will live again. 
1155,"(The ship shakes, people scream. The money globe falls. The Doctor"
1156,jumps and catches it.)
1157,DOCTOR: Do you know what you need? Do you know what any decent headless
1158,king needs? Money. This connects every bank to every other bank in this
1159,galaxy.
1160,"Right here in my hand, all the money you can eat. "
1161,CYBORG: Demonstrate. 
1162,DOCTOR: With pleasure. 
1163,(The Cyborg leans forward and the Doctor places the globe on its neck
1164,connector. Sparks fly from it.)
1165,DOCTOR: Welcome to all the best firewalls in the galaxy. Nothing is
1166,protected like money. Every stock market within a light year is arguing
1167,in your head. 
1168,CYBORG: I do not understand. 
1169,DOCTOR: Ha ha! That's the way it is for most people. 
1170,CYBORG: Do not understand. Do not understand. 
1171,"(The Doctor picks up River's diary which he sees lying on the floor,"
1172,and comments to the Concierge.)
1173,DOCTOR: He had a bad day on the market. 
1174,CYBORG: Do not understand. Do not understand. 
1175,"DOCTOR: Sorry, I appreciate that wasn't very funny, but I couldn't help"
1176,saying it. 
1177,(He runs up the stairs.)

1183,runs in.)
1184,COMPUTER: Surface impact in two minutes.
1185,DOCTOR: Where's everyone else? 
1186,RIVER: They ran for it. So should we. 
1187,DOCTOR: We need to get the navcom back online. And re-route the
1188,thrusters. 
1189,RIVER: I'm trying. 
1190,COMPUTER: Please abandon ship.
1191,(A console sparks.)
1192,"DOCTOR: So, King Hydroflax? "
1193,"RIVER: Oh, how many times? I married the diamond. "
1194,DOCTOR: So you say. 
1195,RIVER: Elizabeth the First. 
1196,DOCTOR: Ramone. 
1197,RIVER: Marilyn Monroe. 
1198,DOCTOR: Stephen Fry. 
1199,RIVER: Cleopatra! 
1200,DOCTOR: Same thing. 
1201,(The Doctor sits in the command seat and River looks out of the forward
1202,windows.)
1203,RIVER: Hang on a minute. I recognise that planet. 
1204,"DOCTOR: Well, that's nice. Maybe they'll name the crater after us. "
1205,RIVER: That's Darillium! 
1206,DOCTOR: Always good to know where we're going. Could you concentrate on
1207,"your work, please? "
1208,"RIVER: You know, the Singing Towers. "
1209,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'll be sure to give them a wave as we zoom past. "
1210,RIVER: You always say you're going to take me there for dinner and then
1211,you always cancel at the last minute. 
1212,"DOCTOR: I'd quite like to cancel this time too, if at all possible. "
1213,(Boom!)
1214,BOTH: Argh! 
1215,(The Doctor uses his nice sonic screwdriver on a console.)
1216,RIVER: What are you doing? That's the internal teleport. 
1217,DOCTOR: Yes. I can use the power cell to boost the thrusters. 
1218,(He uncoils blue neon cables and holds one out to River.)
1219,RIVER: Really? How? 
1220,"DOCTOR: Hold this, quickly. "
1221,"RIVER: Well, I don't see what good this will do. "
1222,"DOCTOR: Sorry, River. Crashing spaceships, that's my job. "

1235,"DOCTOR: No, River, no, no, no, no! "
1236,"(River comes out of the Tardis, followed by the Doctor.)"
1237,DOCTOR: Get back in the Tardis! This is my job! 
1238,RIVER: This is my job! 
1239,DOCTOR: I've been doing it longer. 
1240,RIVER: I do it better. 
1241,"DOCTOR: River, not one person on this ship, not one living thing, is"
1242,worth you. 
1243,RIVER: Or you. 
1244,"COMPUTER: Surface impact in ten, nine, eight "
1245,(The forward window glass is breaking as the ground rushes to meet
1246,them.)

1267,"ALPHONSE: Hello? Sir. The ship, it came down. Did you see it? "
1268,"DOCTOR: Yes, I did. "
1269,ALPHONSE: I've been searching for survivors. 
1270,DOCTOR: I doubt if you'd find any. And I don't think any of them would
1271,"be worth it, if that's a comfort. Brave of you to try, though. Well"
1272,done. 
1273,"ALPHONSE: Thank you, sir. "
1274,(Two tall pillars of stone stand proud of the flat landscape.)
1275,"DOCTOR: Those are the Singing Towers, aren't they? "
1276,"ALPHONSE: Yes, sir, but it's just the wind. "
1277,DOCTOR: The Singing Towers of Darillium. Here we are at last. 
1278,ALPHONSE: Sir? 
1279,"DOCTOR: You know what? They should build a restaurant right here, with"
1280,a view of those towers. You could make a lot of money that way. You
1281,should do that. 
1282,"ALPHONSE: You'd need a lot of money to begin with, sir. "
1283,(The Doctor shows Alphonse the diamond.)
1284,DOCTOR: The Halassi Androvar. I think you'll find that the reward is
1285,pretty substantial.

1297,Christmas Day in four years' time. 
1298,DOCTOR: Not a problem.

1300,"hairstyle is different, so we can presume it is four years later. A"
1301,string orchestra is playing The First Noel.)

1303,balcony. 
1304,RIVER: Oh. Excellent. 
1305,"RECEPTIONIST: This way, ma'am. "
1306,RIVER: Do we have a good table? 
1307,"RECEPTIONIST: The finest in all the galaxy, ma'am. "

1314,see a big red metal being with a tiny bearded human head between its

1317,RAMONE: Professor Song. The Doctor will be with you in a moment. 
1318,RIVER: What are you doing here? 
1319,"RAMONE: They pulled us from the wreckage, ma'am. Fixed us up. I've been"
1320,working here ever since. Don't worry. The nasty part's all gone. Got
1321,deleted in the merger. 
1322,RIVER: What about Nardole?

1343,(And kisses the Doctor on both cheeks.)
1344,"DOCTOR: You look, er, amazing. "
1345,"RIVER: Doctor, you have no idea whether I look amazing or not. "
1346,"DOCTOR: Well, you've moved your hair about, haven't you? "
1347,RIVER: Well done. It's very sweet of you to try. 
1348,DOCTOR: So what do you think? The Singing Towers. 
1349,(River gazes at the pillars with the sun setting behind them.)
1350,RIVER: Oh. The music. Listen to it. Are you crying? 
1351,DOCTOR: No. Just the wind. 
1352,RIVER: Nothing's ever just the wind. 
1353,DOCTOR: No? It blows through the cave system and harmonises with the
1354,crystal layer. 
1355,RIVER: Why are you sad? 
1356,DOCTOR: Why are you sad? 
1357,"RIVER: I told you, my diary's nearly full. I worry. "
1358,DOCTOR: Please don't. 
1359,"RIVER: There are stories about us, you know. "
1360,"DOCTOR: Oh, I dread to think. "
1361,RIVER: I look them up sometimes. 
1362,DOCTOR: You really shouldn't do that. 
1363,RIVER: Some of them suggest that the very last night we spend together
1364,"is at the Singing Towers of Darillium. That wouldn't be true, would it?"
1365,
1366,DOCTOR: Spoilers. 
1367,"RIVER: Oh. Well, that would explain why you kept cancelling coming"
1368,here. Do you remember that time 
1369,"DOCTOR: River, stop. "
1370,RIVER: When there were two of you 
1371,DOCTOR: Don't. 
1372,"RIVER: Because I want you to know that if this is the last night, I"
1373,expect you to find a way round it. 
1374,DOCTOR: Not everything can be avoided. Not forever. 
1375,RIVER: But you're you. There's always a loophole. You wait until the
1376,last minute and then you spring it on me. 
1377,DOCTOR: Every night is the last night for something. Every Christmas is
1378,the last Christmas 
1379,"RIVER: But you will. You'll wait until I've given up hope. All will be lost,"
1380,and you'll do that smug little smile and then you'll save the day. You
1381,always do. 
1382,"DOCTOR: No, I don't. Not always. Times end, River, because they have"
1383,to. Because there's no such thing as happy ever after. It's just a lie
1384,we tell ourselves because the truth is so hard. 
1385,"RIVER: No, Doctor, you're wrong. Happy ever after doesn't mean forever."
1386,It just means time. A little time. But that's not the sort of thing you
1387,"could ever understand, is it? "
1388,DOCTOR: Mmm. What do you think of the towers? 
1389,RIVER: I love them. 
1390,DOCTOR: Then why are you ignoring them? 
1391,RIVER: They're ignoring me. But then you can't expect a monolith to
1392,love you back. 
1393,"DOCTOR: No, you can't. They've been there for millions of years,"
1394,through storms and floods and wars and time. Nobody really understands
1395,where the music comes from.
1396,"It's probably something to do with the precise positions, the distance"
1397,between both towers. Even the locals aren't sure.
1398,All anyone will ever tell you is that when the wind stands fair and the
1399,"night is perfect, when you least expect it but always"
1400,when you need it the most there is a song. 
1401,"RIVER: So, assuming tonight is all we have left."
1402,DOCTOR: I didn't say that. 
1403,RIVER: How long is a night on Darillium? 
1404,DOCTOR: Twenty four years. 
1405,RIVER: (nearly laughing and crying at the same time) I hate you. 
1406,"DOCTOR: No, you don't. "
1407,(They gaze into each others eyes.)
