21,
22,(Two men with swords are walking carefully. When
23,"they have passed, two Saracens come out of hiding.) "
24,"EL AKIR: No, not yet. One of them may be the King. Follow them and"
25,listen to them. 
26,(The Tardis materialises in the wood) 
27,"(Elsewhere, a falconer hoods a hawk.) "
28,"RICHARD: We are the only day and night for you, hunter. "
29,"DE MARUN: I wish that I were a hawk, sire, and Saladin my prey. "
30,RICHARD: Now there's a subject for our troubadours and actors. Speak to
31,"the Chamberlain about it, I beg you, de Marun. "
32,"DE MARUN: I will, my lord. I will have the players call the"
33,"entertainment, The Defeat of Saladin, the Sparrow of the East. "
34,"RICHARD: Well, it'll help us to pass these weary waiting nights at"
35,Jaffa. Here's a man devoted to his work. 
36,"DE TORNEBU: A beautiful thing, sire, but it has a stubborn streak. The"
37,clasp is faulty and needs hot fires to make it pliable. 
38,RICHARD: Perhaps I should ride with craftsmen and leave my knights at
39,home. 
40,(The man with sword that we saw earlier arrives) 
41,DES PREAUX: Your Majesty. 
42,"RICHARD: No, des Preaux, I will not fight today. "
43,DE MARUN: Or do you mean to slay us all? 
44,"DE TORNEBU: And eat us for his dinner, from the look of him. "
45,"DES PREAUX: Sire, I've heard sounds in these woods. "
46,DE MARUN: I've heard nothing. 
47,DE TORNEBU: What sort of sounds? 
48,RICHARD: Let the man speak! 
49,"DES PREAUX: I fear this wood, sire. You are too far from Jaffa and the"
50,Saracens too near. 
51,RICHARD: Have you seen any? 
52,"DES PREAUX: No, but I sense them about us. This wood might have been"
53,designed for ambush. 
54,"RICHARD: What, des Preaux? Would you see danger in your own shadow? "
55,"DE TORNEBU: I have put the brothers de L'Etabe with the horses, sire,"
56,and all is ready for the return to Jaffa. If your Majesty desires to
57,go. 
58,"RICHARD: We will stay here until, William the Wary, you recover your"
59,"composure. And, I hope, your sense of humour. "
60,(The Saracens watch from the bushes)
61,
62,[Outside the Tardis]
63,
64,IAN: I'll just take a look around. 
65,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes. "
66,(Ian encounters an armed Saracen) 
67,IAN: Barbara. 
68,(Someone grabs Barbara from behind.) 
69,DOCTOR: Good afternoon! 
70,(The distraction enables Ian disarm and knock out the Saracen.) 
71,DOCTOR: What is all this? Who is he? How did he attack you? Why did he
72,attack you? 
73,IAN: I don't know. I didn't stop to ask him. 
74,VICKI: What's going on? Where are we? 
75,Ian: Shh! 
76,(Swordplay can be heard.) 
77,IAN: Sounds to me as if he's got some friends. 
78,DOCTOR: Come on. Give me a hand. 
79,VICKI: But who is he? 
80,"DOCTOR: Come away, child. Dear me. Out of one trouble into another! "
81,(They hide the unconscious Saracen.) 
82,IAN: Barbara. Where's Barbara? Barbara! 
83,(Barbara has been gagged and is being thoroughly tied up) 
84,IAN : Barbara! 
85,(The noise of fighting gets closer) 
86,IAN: Someone's coming. Hide. 
87,(The King is wounded. De Tornebu is shot by an arrow so the Doctor and
88,Vicki haul him into the bushes. Then de
89,"Marun is also shot, allowing the King to fall near Ian.) "
90,"DES PREAUX: Saracens, I am the king! I am Malek Ric! "
91,"EL AKIR: No. You have no friends to protect you now, Malek Ric. "
92,"DES PREAUX: Am I to die as well? If so, dispatch me and have done with"
93,it. 
94,EL AKIR: A king at liberty may give commands. A captured one obeys
95,them. Take him! Find the others and kill them. 
96,(The Saracens leave except one. Ian lures him away from Richard then
97,lets a branch spring back into his face. Ian then uses a dropped sword
98,to fight him) 
99,(The Doctor checks on the wounded and has to fight another Saracen. De
100,Tornebu saves him by throwing his sword
101,into the Saracen.) 
102,"DOCTOR: It's all right, old chap, I have my friend here to thank for my"
103,life. Are you
104,"all right, dear boy? "
105,"IAN: Yes, I'm all right. "
106,DOCTOR: That Saracen very nearly did for me. Of course. Did you hear
107,what that man
108,"called him? Saracen. Malek Ric! Yes, that was the name the Saracens had"
109,"for King Richard, Coeur de Lion. Malek Ric. "
110,VICKI: So we're in the Holy Land? He's trying to say something. What 
111,"DOCTOR: Yes, he's got a very bad wound here. "
112,DE TORNEBU: He was not the King. 
113,VICKI: Not the King? 
114,DE TORNEBU: The belt. Get the belt. 
115,VICKI: This belt? 
116,"DOCTOR: This belt. Wait a minute. Of course, yes. I remember. This"
117,"belongs to his royal master, King Richard. He'll certainly be glad to"
118,get this back again. We should be able to get into his favour. We shall
119,need some assistance to help find Barbara. 
120,"IAN: We can't wait that long, Doctor. I'm going to have another look"
121,for her now. 
122,"DOCTOR: Be careful, my boy. "
123,(Barbara is being hauled through the wood) 
124,IAN : Barbara! Barbara! 
125,(Richard gets up and staggers away) 
126,"(Later, Vicki is tending the wounded knight.) "
127,"DOCTOR: How is he, my dear? Did he take the drug I gave you? "
128,"VICKI: Yes, but I'm afraid he's unconscious again. "
129,"DOCTOR: Yes. Well, he should be better when we get him back to his own"
130,people. 
131,(Ian enters.) 
132,VICKI: Where have you been? 
133,DOCTOR: Are you all right? 
134,VICKI: You've been gone over an hour. 
135,IAN: There's no sign of Barbara anywhere. 
136,"DOCTOR: Well, as I said before, we must try and get some help from King"
137,Richard. This certainly belongs to him. 
138,"IAN: I suppose you're right, but how are we going to set about it? "
139,"DOCTOR: Well, at the moment we can do nothing further until I find some"
140,"clothes for all of us to wear,"
141,hmm? Yes. Now I think Vicki and I should go down into that city and see
142,"what we can find. Now, here, child. Put on this cloak, and it'll help"
143,to act as a disguise. 
144,"IAN: While you're gone, I'll gather some branches and make a stretcher"
145,for him. 
146,"DOCTOR: It's a good idea, but be careful. In the meantime, keep your"
147,eye on that. 
148,(He gives Ian the belt.) 
149,"IAN: Oh, yeah. "
150,"DOCTOR: Come along, child. "
151,[Prisoner's tent] 
152,(Barbara and de Preaux are under heavy guard) 
153,DES PREAUX: I will do you no harm. 
154,"BARBARA: Oh. Oh, thank heaven they've taken that gag away. Umm, I'm so"
155,thirsty. 
156,(Des Preaux puts a cloak around her shoulders and gets her a dish of
157,water.) 
158,"DES PREAUX: I do not know who you are, or how you came to be in the"
159,wood outside Jaffa. Your clothing is strange. It has caused some talk. 
160,"BARBARA: Thank you for the cloak. Oh, that's better. Where are we? "
161,DES PREAUX: I am told we are at Ramlah. 
162,BARBARA: Ramlah? 
163,DES PREAUX: The great Sultan's encampment. 
164,"BARBARA: Oh, I see. What are we doing here? "
165,"DES PREAUX: As for you, I can make no guess. But I am King Richard,"
166,"Coeur de Lion, leader of the mighty host, scourge of the infidel. "
167,BARBARA: But I thought Richard had red hair. 
168,DES PREAUX: Had? Still has if the ruse has worked. 
169,"BARBARA: Oh, then you "
170,"DES PREAUX: I am Sir William des Preaux, captured and mistaken for my"
171,"King. Some smiles will turn to long faces soon, I have no doubt. "
172,"BARBARA: Yes, I heard the sound of fighting in the wood. "
173,DES PREAUX: We were sadly outnumbered and taken by surprise. 
174,BARBARA: What happened to the others in the wood? 
175,DES PREAUX: I do not know. Maybe I shall never know. But I have a
176,"hopeful heart and, which is better, a lucky King. And you, who will not"
177,say her name. 
178,BARBARA: Barbara. 
179,DES PREAUX: Barbara. I would like to know how one so gentle puts
180,herself among the swords and arrows. And your garments are a fashion in
181,themselves. 
182,"BARBARA: Take me back to that wood, Sir William, and I'll answer all"
183,your questions. 
184,DES PREAUX: You ask for the impossible very lightly. 
185,BARBARA: Is it so impossible? 
186,DES PREAUX: Today it is. But what am I to say of you to the heathen?
187,How can I explain you to them? 
188,"BARBARA: Well, to them you're King Richard, so who would travel with"
189,Richard? 
190,"DES PREAUX: The Queen would not, but the Princess Yes, you shall be"
191,"Joanna, my sister, and help me in my lies. "
192,BARBARA: Very well. I seem to have gained a brother and a title. 
193,"DES PREAUX: And what is more, a friend. "
194,BARBARA: I'm grateful for that. 
195,"DES PREAUX: Shh. Remember, you are Joanna. "
196,(El Akir enters.) 
197,EL AKIR: Yusef Salah ed-Din has commanded that all prisoners be treated
198,with compassion. Would you say I have complied with his wishes? 
199,DES PREAUX: The Sultan of Egypt and Syria would no doubt be pleased.
200,"But this lady, my sister "
201,EL AKIR: Sister? 
202,"DES PREAUX: Aye. Joanna, Princess of England and closest to me in"
203,"affection. My sister has been ill-treated, handled roughly by your men."
204,Is this the compassion Saladin speaks of? 
205,EL AKIR: Enough of your babbling. The woman is all of one piece. 
206,"DES PREAUX: Woman? Hold your tongue, Saracen! "
207,(The guards restrain des Preaux.) 
208,"EL AKIR: We shall call her a prisoner, then. Does that sound better?"
209,"You have no rights, no privileges, nothing except the benevolence of"
210,our leader. That you are the King's sister bodes well for me. I can
211,serve both the Sultan and Malek el Adil. 
212,DES PREAUX: Saphadin? 
213,"EL AKIR: As you call the Sultan's brother, yes. He will be pleased to"
214,see the woman he has so long admired. Let him go. He is a lion without
215,claws. 
216,(El Akir exits.) 
217,BARBARA: Someone is going to have a very red face before long. 
218,DES PREAUX: And an angry temper. 
219,[Street] 
220,(Traders shout out their wares to passers-by.) 
221,DAHEER: Silks. Satins. Fine robes. Rich silks. Satins from Basra. Fine
222,robes. Silks. Satins. The finest robes in Jaffa! Silks. Satins. Fine
223,robes. Rich silks. Fine satins. The finest robes in Jaffa. 
224,(The Doctor approaches.) 
225,"DAHEER: My lord. You are from Pisa, my lord? "
226,DOCTOR: No. 
227,"DAHEER: Genoa, then? "
228,DOCTOR: I know of the place well. 
229,"DAHEER: You are very cautious, you traders from Venice. "
230,"DOCTOR: I am not a Venetian, neither am I a trader. "
231,"DAHEER: Oh, your pardon, my lord. The richness of your cloak is hidden"
232,by the darkness. 
233,DOCTOR: You have some very fine materials here. 
234,"DAHEER: The finest on the coast, my lord. "
235,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's what they all say. "
236,"DAHEER: Please, step into my humble shop. "
237,(The Doctor and Daheer go into the shop as Vicki sneaks up and sits by
238,the door.) 
239,[Daheer's shop]
240,
241,"DOCTOR: Truly remarkable, all the colours of the"
242,"rainbow. Ha, ha! Yes, it's truly Where did you say these wonderful"
243,materials came from? 
244,"DAHEER: Basra, my lord. "
245,"DOCTOR: Basra? Ah, most interesting. "
246,(An English man enters the shop.) 
247,"DAHEER: Forgive me, my lord. Why can't you be more careful when you"
248,come here? Why can't you wait until the place is empty? 
249,(Daheer looks through the bundle of clothes the man has brought him.) 
250,"THATCHER: They're all good, fine things. I want more than you paid last"
251,time. 
252,DAHEER: Such clothes as these are difficult for me to sell. 
253,THATCHER: Just give me my money. 
254,DAHEER: I a afraid that I may sell them to the person you took them
255,from. 
256,"THATCHER: A good price, that's all I ask. "
257,"DOCTOR: (sotto) Having been stolen once, they can be stolen again, or"
258,"perhaps borrowed, shall we say, hmm? "
259,(The Doctor ducks under a table while Daheer pays his supplier.) 
260,"THATCHER: Here, that's not enough. It was dangerous work getting them"
261,"things. If I was caught, do you know what would happen?"
262,Do you know the King's punishment for thieves? I'd be shorn like a
263,prizefighter and boiling pitch poured on me head. And as for you. 
264,"(From under the table, the Doctor snaffles a garment.) "
265,DAHEER: You did get out of the palace without being seen? 
266,"THATCHER: Of course I did. Remember, I can go elsewhere next time. "
267,DAHEER: And get less. 
268,(The Doctor takes some boots then other garments.) 
269,"THATCHER: I couldn't get any less than what you give me. Blimey, it was"
270,hard word getting around the palace. I couldn't have done anything. I
271,spend all my time trying to get this money and you do nothing. 
272,"DAHEER: As you paid nothing for them in the first place, you have done"
273,very well. 
274,THATCHER: Bah! 
275,(Thatcher leaves) 
276,DAHEER: My lord? My lord? I was sure that he would buy from me. I could
277,have sworn that he hadn't left. 
278,"(The Doctor ties a rope around a leg of the next table, then pulls and"
279,makes it collapse.) 
280,"DAHEER: No, my beautiful clothes! Oh, they're ruined, all covered in"
281,"mud. My silks and satins. My embroidery from India. Oh, I am beset by"
282,devils! Oh! 
283,(The Doctor throws the clothes and boots to Vicki.) 
284,"DOCTOR: Oh, my poor friend, what a misfortune. You've had an accident. "
285,DAHEER: Am I not the most miserable of men. 
286,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, you are, but I'm afraid I must leave you with your"
287,"misfortune. But I shall return. Yes, I will return and you shall not be"
288,the loser by this business. 
289,"DAHEER: Oh please do. Please do, my lord. "
290,DOCTOR: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
291,"DAHEER: For what, my lord? "
292,"DOCTOR: Oh, for being here. For being here when you were most needed."
293,"Yes, yes. Goodbye. "
294,"DAHEER: Goodbye, my lord. "
295,DOCTOR: Goodbye. And long live the Sultan. 
296,DAHEER: Yes. 
297,[Saladin's throne room] 
298,"SAPHADIN: Speak, El Akir. "
299,"EL AKIR: My lord, I bring good fortune. Not only for your ears, but for"
300,he who rules all of us as well. 
301,SAPHADIN: My brother hears you as I do. 
302,EL AKIR: I would see his face when I tell my story. 
303,SAPHADIN: Be content that your voice is heard. If what you have to say
304,"pleases my brother, then you will see him. "
305,(Saladin is sitting behind a curtain.) 
306,"EL AKIR: Know then that I, El Akir, have the instrument to vanquish the"
307,invaders from across the seas. 
308,SAPHADIN: Indeed? 
309,"EL AKIR: I have taken two prisoners. One of them, the King of the"
310,"English, Malek Ric. "
311,SAPHADIN: Malek Ric? If you are speaking the truth. 
312,(El Akir signals his guards to bring in des Preaux) 
313,EL AKIR: The Lion is in our cage. 
314,"SAPHADIN: Good fortune indeed, El Akir. "
315,"EL AKIR: The other, a priceless stone I bring to lay before you as your"
316,"heart desires. The sister of the Malek Ric, here for your command. "
317,(Barbara enters.) 
318,SAPHADIN: Princess Joanna. 
319,EL AKIR: No less. 
320,SAPHADIN: Less then less! Who is this creature? This rowdy jackal that
321,yaps at my feet with tales of fortune and success? 
322,EL AKIR: My lord. 
323,SAPHADIN: You vile worm. Do you think I do not know the face and the
324,form of the Princess? You take me for a fool? 
325,EL AKIR: You tricked me! 
326,(Saladin enters.) 
327,SALADIN: Be silent. This is not King Richard. 
328,EL AKIR: Not? 
329,SALADIN: A blacker head of red-gold hair I never saw. You have the
330,"better bargain, brother. She may not be the Princess, but her beauty"
331,lights the room. 
332,"EL AKIR: My lord, I swear. "
333,SALADIN: I do not wish to hear you. But I will listen to you. 
334,"DES PREAUX: I am William des Preaux, and to aid my King's escape, I"
335,"shouted out his name and took his identity. This lady, your Highness,"
336,"has no part in this matter but in aiding my pretence, and I beg you to"
337,"look upon her kindly, whatever fate you have for me. "
338,SALADIN: I salute your chivalry. All is now clear to me except the
339,lady's presence. 
340,"EL AKIR: Great Sultan, this woman can be made to entertain you. I can"
341,"have her dance on hot coals, run a gauntlet of sharp tipped swords. "
342,DES PREAUX: No! 
343,EL AKIR: Die for your pleasure. 
344,SALADIN: What do you say to that? 
345,BARBARA: It sounds like the punishment for a fool. 
346,"SALADIN: It does. And who here is the most foolish? El Akir, I can"
347,devise my own pleasures. Go with Sir William. Let me hear you have
348,treated him like a brother. Let him have all the liberty except liberty
349,itself. 
350,"(des Preaux, El Akir and guards leave.) "
351,SALADIN: Are you afraid of me? 
352,BARBARA: No. 
353,"SALADIN: You're not of these lands, yet you seem to be a stranger to"
354,Sir William. 
355,BARBARA: I'm a traveller. I came with three friends. We arrived in the
356,wood. 
357,SALADIN: You rode into the wood? 
358,BARBARA: No. 
359,SAPHADIN: You walked into it? 
360,BARBARA: Not that either. 
361,SALADIN: You arrived? 
362,BARBARA: Yes. In a box. 
363,"SAPHADIN: In a box? Ah, you were carried into the wood. "
364,BARBARA: Yes. 
365,SALADIN: Please talk. It helps me to consider what I have to do with
366,you. 
367,"BARBARA: Well, I could say that I'm from another world, a world ruled"
368,by insects. And before that we were in Rome at the time of Nero. Before
369,"that we were in England, far, far into the future. "
370,"SALADIN: Now I understand, you and your friends, you are players,"
371,entertainers. 
372,SAPHADIN: With little value in an exchange of prisoners with the
373,"English King, brother. This is a trivial affair. I do not know why you"
374,waste your time. 
375,(Saphadin leaves.) 
376,SALADIN: I cannot dispense life and death lightly. If Sir William is to
377,"be returned, he must make good report of our mercy. Perhaps that is the"
378,factor in your favour. 
379,BARBARA: I don't believe you're as calculating as that. 
380,SALADIN: Then learn more of me. You must serve my purpose or you have
381,no purpose. Grace my table tonight in more suitable clothes. If your
382,"tales beguile me, you shall stay and entertain. "
383,BARBARA: Like Scheherazade. 
384,SALADIN: Over whose head hung sentence of death.
385,
386,[Richard's throne room]
387,
388,"(The Doctor, Ian and Vicki in her new clothes watch"
389,as a servant tries to tend Richard's head wound with a poultice) 
390,RICHARD: Right! Enough! This is the Devil's own embrocation. Continue. 
391,"DE TORNEBU: And so these kindly people, whose faces were like hidden in"
392,"a mist until the moment passed, saved my life and brought me here. "
393,"RICHARD: Good friends, indeed. We thank you. The brothers de L'Etable"
394,are dead. de Marun dead. Sir Richard des Preaux taken. What have I left
395,but one wounded friend and a sore head? 
396,"DOCTOR: One small thing remains yours, sire. "
397,(The Doctor hands over the belt.) 
398,"RICHARD: Once again, I am in your debt. But I'd give this for de Marun"
399,and the others. My friends cut down about my ears or stolen. My armies
400,roust about the streets and clutter up the streets of Jaffa with the
401,garbage of their vices. And now I learn my brother John thirsts after
402,"power, drinking great draughts of it though it's not his to take. He's"
403,"planning to usurp my crown, and trade with my enemy, Philip of France."
404,Trade! A tragedy of fortunes and I am too much beset by them. A curse
405,on this! A thousand curses! 
406,IAN: We must ask him. 
407,DOCTOR: I'm not sure this is the time. 
408,"VICKI: No, he doesn't seem in the best of moods, does he? "
409,IAN: We can't wait for his moods. 
410,"DOCTOR: Gently, my boy, gently. "
411,IAN: Your Majesty. There were four of us in that wood. One of our
412,companions was a lady.
413,She 
414,RICHARD: Do not bother me with such things now. 
415,IAN: I am asking you to send me with an escort to Saladin's
416,headquarters. 
417,RICHARD: And what do you do when you are there? 
418,IAN: Arrange for the release of our friends. 
419,RICHARD: As my emissary to Saladin? 
420,IAN: Yes. 
421,"RICHARD: What, flatter him? Bring him presents in return? "
422,"DOCTOR: It would be of little use, a player king and a young woman,"
423,sire. 
424,RICHARD: No. 
425,IAN: I can bring them both back. 
426,RICHARD: No. 
427,IAN: Why not? 
428,"RICHARD: Are you deaf? We do not trade with Saladin today. Not today,"
429,"nor tomorrow, nor any day henceforth. "
430,"DOCTOR: Our young friend is a woman, sire. Have pity. Let us help her. "
431,"VICKI: Please, your Majesty. "
432,RICHARD: Understand this. This woman can rot in one of Saladin's

436, Episode Two - The
437,Knight of Jaffa 
438, [Richard's throne room].
439,
440,"DE TORNEBU: My lord, although we left a little of"
441,"our pride back in the woods, there is some capital to be gained from"
442,"the affair. Beside the violence and the tragedy, it has a humour. "
443,RICHARD: Humour? Is he delirious? 
444,"DOCTOR: I think I know what he means, sire. Here Saladin, mighty ruler"
445,"and commander of huge armies, believes he's captured you. "
446,VICKI: You could turn this into a good story against Saladin. 
447,"DE TORNEBU: Look on the brighter side, my lord. A troop of men to"
448,"capture one of your knights? Why, he'd need an army by itself and more"
449,"to take your horse, or every man he has or more to take you prisoner. "
450,DOCTOR: You could spread this tale by word of mouth and all the world
451,would know that Saladin fears you. 
452,"VICKI: Sire, if you send to him and asked if he'd finished playing his"
453,"game and could you have your knight back, it'll make him look such a"
454,fool. 
455,"RICHARD: There is a jest here, albeit a grim one with our friends dead."
456,But Saladin must be just as much out of temper over this affair as we
457,are. 
458,DOCTOR: Your messenger might offer to exchange a hundred prisoners for
459,the knight he holds. 
460,"RICHARD: We think we value Sir William highly. We do, but it would not"
461,be good to let Saladin know. 
462,DOCTOR: He might think you undervalue his men. One hundred men to one
463,"of yours. Methinks a fair bargain, sire. "
464,"RICHARD: By my father's name, you have wit, old man. Guard, call the"
465,Chamberlain. We recognise the service you have rendered us and will be
466,pleased to see you in our court. 
467,"DOCTOR: We are your servants, sire. "
468,RICHARD: As to the sending of a messenger? Joanna. 
469,(Princess Joanna enters.) 
470,"JOANNA: Brother, are you wounded? "
471,"RICHARD: Even my pride has been mended, sister. See these good people?"
472,"Courage, loyalty, and wit are gathered here. "
473,"DE TORNEBU: Forgive me, my lady. "
474,JOANNA: This man should be in his bed. 
475,RICHARD: Yes. Chamberlain! Where are you? 
476,"CHAMBERLAIN : Coming, sire, coming. "
477,RICHARD: Take this knight and see that he is well looked after and find
478,places for these others. They have our patronage. 
479,"CHAMBERLAIN: Thatcher, guard, lend a hand. "
480,VICKI: Be careful. Mind his shoulder. 
481,IAN: We should carry him. 
482,VICKI: Shall I help? 
483,"IAN: No, I think we can manage. "
484,JOANNA: This is a young man? 
485,"DOCTOR: His voice has not yet broken, your Highness. "
486,JOANNA: What is your name? 
487,VICKI: Victor. 
488,JOANNA: Do you sing songs or play an instrument? 
489,VICKI: No. Nobody ever showed me. 
490,"JOANNA: We must do something about your clothes, at least. "
491,"DOCTOR: Your Highness. Come, Victor. Let us tend upon the others. "
492,"CHAMBERLAIN: Thank you, young man. You may leave him to us. "
493,[Outside the throne room]
494,
495,IAN: Giving him back his belt didn't help us very
496,much. 
497,DOCTOR: I certainly didn't like the way the Chamberlain examined
498,"Vicki's clothes. And come to think of it, they were originally stolen"
499,from here. 
500,VICKI: Shh!
501,
502,[Richard's throne room]
503,
504,JOANNA: Strange people. 
505,RICHARD: Good friends. And what is this? I have not seen this jewel
506,before. 
507,JOANNA: A gift from the man you fight. 
508,RICHARD: Saladin? 
509,"JOANNA: His brother, Saphadin. Oh, I have given no cause for his"
510,attention. 
511,"RICHARD: Saladin sends me presents of fruit and snow when I am sick,"
512,and now his brother decorates you with his jewels. Yet with our armies
513,"do we both lock in deadly combat, watering the land with a rain of"
514,"blood, and the noise of thunder is drowned in the shouts of dying men. "
515,"JOANNA: Your heart calls for England, Richard. "
516,"RICHARD: Aye, it does. "
517,JOANNA: Is there no kind of peace with Saladin? 
518,RICHARD: All wise men look for peace. The terms of peace make wise men
519,"look fools. I would have Ascalon, but Saladin fears that if he gives me"
520,"that town then I will invade Egypt, and nothing I can say can make him"
521,"change his mind. How this jewel radiates the light. So, Saphadin"
522,desires my sister. 
523,"JOANNA: But surely you and Saladin have some common meeting ground,"
524,Richard? 
525,RICHARD: Joanna? Saphadin?
526,
527,[Outside Saladin's throne room]
528,
529,EL AKIR: Now take this and tell me where the woman
530,is. 
531,SHEYRAH: No. 
532,EL AKIR: Then bring her to me. 
533,SHEYRAH: No! 
534,EL AKIR: Then deserve my displeasure. 
535,SHEYRAH: My lord is greater than you. 
536,EL AKIR: Where is she? 
537,(Sheyrah gets away when Luigi enters) 
538,LUIGI: She was a fool not to take the ring. But perhaps you were asking
539,"too much for it. Now I have something to ask of someone, if only I knew"
540,their price. 
541,"EL AKIR: I'm not bought by you, merchant. "
542,"LUIGI: You are an Emir, El Akir. What possessions of mine could"
543,possibly match those you already own? But I'm travelled from Tyre to
544,"speak with Saladin at Ramlah, a weary journey, and neither he nor his"
545,brother will receive me. 
546,EL AKIR: It's nothing to me. I'm leaving Ramlah. 
547,LUIGI: Do you return to your palace at Lydda? 
548,EL AKIR: Yes. 
549,"LUIGI: Then what keeps you here? We both have reasons for being here,"
550,El Akir. Can we not help each other? 
551,"EL AKIR: And what is your reason, merchant? "
552,LUIGI: Conrad of Tyre has sent an emissary here to make a treaty with
553,your overlord. I come on his heels. Where there is a treaty there is a
554,chance of profit. What lies unwanted on my ships at Tyre will find a
555,home in Saladin. And from him I can buy and stock my ships again. 
556,"EL AKIR: And what is my part in this, merchant? "
557,LUIGI: Arrange an audience with Saladin or his brother. But how will I
558,repay such a favour? 
559,"EL AKIR: There is a woman here, an English woman. She made me look a"
560,fool. I shall take her to my palace at Lydda and then we shall see who
561,"the fool is, or the master. "
562,"LUIGI: A simple matter. Arrange my audience, then wait by the stables."
563,I'll bring the woman to you.
564,
565,[Barbara's tent] 
566,SHEYRAH: Your lord will be dazzled with your
567,"beauty, my lady. "
568,"BARBARA: Thank you, Sheyrah. "
569,"SHEYRAH: Lady, I "
570,BARBARA: What is it? 
571,SHEYRAH: The whispers are about that you will tell a never-ending
572,story. 
573,"BARBARA: Oh, yes. How did I get myself involved in this? "
574,"SHEYRAH: Be at peace, my lady. You only tremble at the honour of"
575,"appearing before the great Sultan. I must tell you something, my lady."
576,You have made an enemy. You must beware. 
577,BARBARA: An enemy? 
578,"SHEYRAH: El Akir is planning I know not what, but he is an evil man. "
579,BARBARA: How do you know this? 
580,SHEYRAH: Already he has tried to buy my loyalty with precious stones.
581,You must be cautious. Escape if you can. 
582,BARBARA: El Akir? But surely Saladin 
583,"SHEYRAH: I cannot say more, my lady. "
584,BARBARA: Sheyrah. 
585,"SHEYRAH: Please, my lady. I will fetch your shoes. "
586,BARBARA: Escape? But how? A never-ending story. What am I going to do?
587,"Stories. Stories. Shakespeare! Yes, Romeo and Juliet. Hans Christian"
588,Andersen. Lilliput. Gulliver's Travels. 
589,"LUIGI: I am Luigi Ferrigo, merchant from Genoa. I have got a horse for"
590,you at the stables. 
591,BARBARA: Did Sir William send you? 
592,"SHEYRAH : Which shoes shall I bring, my lady? "
593,"LUIGI: Sir William? Yes, yes, he sent me. Now please, hurry. "
594,(Luigi takes Barbara away before Sheyrah re-enters) 
595,SHEYRAH: My lady? My lady? 
596,(She notices a man's glove on the table)
597,
598,[Stables]
599,
600,BARBARA: Where is he? 
601,"LUIGI: We are almost there. Now please hurry, The man should be here. "
602,EL AKIR: He is. 
603,(El Akir puts his hand over Barbara's mouth) 
604,EL AKIR: Your way is open to the Sultan's brother.
605,
606,[Richard's palace - robing room]
607,
608,"IAN: Oh, I think this whole thing is ridiculous. "
609,"DOCTOR: You do, do you? Then I suggest we get along with it. "
610,IAN: Why have I got to put this lot on? 
611,"DOCTOR: How should I know, dear fellow? If the King wants you to,"
612,surely that's good enough. 
613,"VICKI: Anyway, what are you complaining about? For all you know, it"
614,might give you a better chance to find Barbara. 
615,"DOCTOR: Never mind the mights, my dear, just concentrate on what you're"
616,doing. Here we are.
617,Now I think just the sword and you're ready. 
618,IAN: Ready for what?? 
619,"DOCTOR: Oh, the King will tell you that. Do you know, my boy, I have an"
620,idea that King Richard still wants to send you to see Saladin after
621,all.
622,
623,[Richard's throne room]
624,
625,RICHARD: (dictating to a cleric) And not only this
626,"kingdom, its towns and fortresses, shall be yours, but also the"
627,"Frankish kingdom. Our sister, the Princess Joanna, whose beauty is"
628,"already spoken of wherever men of judgement and discernment are, is a"
629,"fit match for one who not only enjoys so grand. No, not grand, eminent."
630,So eminent a brother as the Sultan Saladin but who also possesses an
631,"element of his own. Prince Saphadin, we beg you to prefer this match"
632,"and thus make us your brother. Now, let me see. See it's delivered"
633,immediately. 
634,"(The Doctor, Ian and Vicki enter) "
635,"RICHARD: Ah, sirrah. Some business with you. Come closer. "
636,"DOCTOR: Your royal commands have been carried out, your Majesty. "
637,RICHARD: Take this gold belt to the Sultan Saladin. Beg him to release
638,Sir William des Preaux and your companion. 
639,"VICKI: Ian, how marvellous! "
640,"DOCTOR: You are very gracious, sire. "
641,RICHARD: Do you wonder why I listen to your appeal? 
642,DOCTOR: It is a king's prerogative to make yesterday's deafness today's
643,keen hearing. 
644,RICHARD: No more than that. Although we do not doubt that we are
645,"surrounded by loyal men, yet we fear that war is uppermost in their"
646,"minds. Between ourselves, we plan a match between Joanna and Saphadin"
647,to bring peace. This is why we choose to send you rather than those who
648,"are closer to us. Bring back Sir William and your companion, but bring"
649,us hope as well. This blood-letting must stop! 
650,"IAN: May I leave at once, sir? "
651,RICHARD: Is it love of peace or is it love of your companion that
652,"prompts this enthusiasm? Well, whatever the reason, may it speed you"
653,back to us. I have one duty to perform before you leave. Give me the
654,"sword, boy. You are without rank or title and while we do not doubt"
655,"your courage, our emissary shall speak from a proper position of"
656,authority. What is your name? 
657,IAN: Ian Chesterton. 
658,RICHARD: Kneel. 
659,IAN: But I 
660,"DOCTOR: Kneel, my boy. Kneel, kneel. Come along, come along. "
661,"RICHARD: In the name of God, Saint Michael, and Saint George, we dub"
662,"you Sir Ian, Knight of Jaffa. Arise Sir Ian, and be valiant. "
663,IAN: Your majesty.
664,
665,[Richard's palace - robing room]
666,
667,CHAMBERLAIN: With long white hair? 
668,"DAHEER: Yes, my lord, yes. "
669,CHAMBERLAIN: A dark cloak which nearly brushes the ground? 
670,"DAHEER: The same, and if he has the articles you mentioned, then he"
671,stole them from me. 
672,CHAMBERLAIN: Then we shall wait here for his return and face him with
673,his infamy.
674,
675,[Saladin's throne room]
676,
677,"LUIGI: Perfumes, materials from Baghdad, ivory,"
678,"gold, spices. All these, Prince Saphadin, are now but a trickle because"
679,of this war. 
680,SAPHADIN: My brother has not yet made any treaty with Conrad of Tyre. 
681,"LUIGI: I am a merchant, and hope I do no wrong in anticipating events,"
682,my lord. 
683,SAPHADIN: You are seeking a concession? 
684,"LUIGI: I am, yes, sire. I am well-known for my proper dealings. "
685,"SAPHADIN: Yes, your reputation has flown ahead of you. Where there are"
686,"transactions to be made, there will one find Master Ferrigo. "
687,"LUIGI: It is my calling, Prince Saphadin. "
688,"SAPHADIN: Well, help me judge another matter. and I may understand your"
689,mind a little better. 
690,SALADIN: I will hear this. 
691,"SAPHADIN: Yes, brother. "
692,"SALADIN: This is a domestic matter only, but since it concerns a person"
693,"nearer your way of thinking than ours, we welcome your advice. "
694,(Sir William des Preaux enters with Sheyrah.) 
695,SAPHADIN: A prisoner has escaped. 
696,LUIGI: Indeed? 
697,"SALADIN: A woman, one I hoped might perhaps divert this court. I had"
698,reason to believe she was a teller of stories. 
699,SAPHADIN: Speak! 
700,SHEYRAH: Do not blame me! 
701,SALADIN: Tell me what happened. 
702,"SHEYRAH: I do not know. I went to fetch her shoes, and when I returned"
703,she was gone. That's all I know. 
704,"SALADIN: And you, Sir William, know nothing of this affair? "
705,"DES PREAUX: Nothing, lord Saladin. I would not encourage a lady to"
706,venture out alone. 
707,SALADIN: I believe you. Nor do I believe the woman would go by herself.
708,
709,"SAPHADIN: What is your opinion, merchant? "
710,"LUIGI: Er, this woman, er, had an accomplice perhaps? A companion who"
711,"helped her, acted as her guide. "
712,DES PREAUX: She was abducted. That is the only explanation. 
713,SALADIN: Yes! 
714,"LUIGI: I see, of course. That is an explanation. "
715,"SAPHADIN: What else have you to say, woman? "
716,SHEYRAH: You mean what I found? 
717,SAPHADIN: Yes. 
718,SHEYRAH: On the table I found a glove. 
719,SALADIN: A man's glove? 
720,"SHEYRAH: Yes, my lord. "
721,SALADIN: This glove? 
722,"SHEYRAH: Yes, lord. "
723,"SALADIN: It has a companion, Sir William."
724,(the glove tucked into Luigi's belt) 
725,DES PREAUX: Where is she? What have you done with her? 
726,LUIGI: I took her to El Akir. 
727,[Richard's palace - corridor]
728,
729,"DOCTOR: I hope you will find Barbara safe and well,"
730,"dear boy, er, Sir Ian. "
731,"VICKI: Good luck, Ian. Be as quick as you can. "
732,"IAN: I will, Vicki. "
733,"DOCTOR: Godspeed. And remember, be valiant. "
734,(Ian leaves.) 
735,DOCTOR: I almost wish I'd been knighted too. 
736,"VICKI: That'll be the day. Come on, let's go and tidy Ian's things."
737,
738,[Richard's palace - robing room]

740,CHAMBERLAIN: I have been waiting to speak with you.
741,
742,"DOCTOR: Oh? Pray, what about? "
743,DAHEER: Thief! 
744,VICKI: I beg your pardon! 
745,DOCTOR: What's this? 
746,"DAHEER: Visitor of sorrows, depriver of my children, robber of my"
747,goods. 
748,DOCTOR: Who is this? Do you know? 
749,"VICKI: No. Oh, his face is a bit familiar. "
750,CHAMBERLAIN: You stole some clothing. 
751,DOCTOR: Really? 
752,CHAMBERLAIN: You see this riding habit? It was taken from this very
753,room. Now it is back here again. 
754,"DOCTOR: And a pretty poor garment, too. "
755,"CHAMBERLAIN: This and this, stolen from me. "
756,DAHEER: And stolen from me. 
757,"DOCTOR: Yes, now there really is a point there, isn't there? If I stole"
758,"from you, my lord Chamberlain, how could I steal from him? "
759,DAHEER: You did. You did steal from me. 
760,"DOCTOR: Then how could I steal from him, eh, you blockhead? "
761,"CHAMBERLAIN: Please, please. Now, I had the clothes first. "
762,"DOCTOR: Oh, how nice for you. "
763,DAHEER: And I had them second. 
764,VICKI: Did you buy them? 
765,DAHEER: Yes. 
766,VICKI: From us? 
767,DAHEER: No. 
768,DOCTOR: Then whoever it was stole them from you must have sold them to
769,"you. Now, don't you agree? "
770,"CHAMBERLAIN: Er, yes. "
771,"THATCHER: My lord Chamberlain, a ship is in the harbour disgorging"
772,fruit from Acre. 
773,DAHEER: That's the man. I bought them from him. 
774,DOCTOR: He must have stolen them from you. 
775,CHAMBERLAIN: Thatcher! You villain! 
776,"DOCTOR: Now, just a minute! Oh, my dear Chamberlain, so undignified."
777,The merchant bought the clothes in good faith and paid for them in good
778,money. Now please return his money. 
779,CHAMBERLAIN: But I have to catch the thief. 
780,"DOCTOR: Now, now, now. You mustn't let an honest man suffer. Pay him! "
781,CHAMBERLAIN: Doh! Thatcher! Thatcher! 
782,"DAHEER: Joy to you, my lord! Giver of life to my father, provider! "
783,"DOCTOR: Yes, off you go! Off you go! Well, we seem to have got out of"
784,"that problem all right, hmm? "

795,"DES PREAUX: Yes, Sir Ian, I fear so. Your rescue has come too late. "
796,"IAN: Well, who's taken her? "
797,DES PREAUX: This Genoese merchant. He explained it away by saying that
798,Barbara had conceived a passion for El Akir. Saladin and his brother
799,"accept the story, but I do not! "
800,"IAN: Well, of course not. It's a lie. "
801,DES PREAUX: They could be as friendly as a hawk and a sparrow. 
802,IAN: Where can I find El Akir? 
803,DES PREAUX: He has returned to Lydda since falling out with Saladin. 
804,IAN: Is Lydda very far away? 
805,"DES PREAUX: No, but it's El Akir's territory, where he has his men. "
806,IAN: I'm going after her. 
807,DES PREAUX: El Akir has an evil reputation. It's my belief he captured
808,"your companion as revenge, and in his eyes she would make a fine"
809,addition to his harem.

838,"DOCTOR: All right, all right, don't get so carried away my friend. It's"
839,a fine cloak. You've done a very good job. 
840,DAHEER: My lord is most gracious. 
841,"DOCTOR: Now the next question is, what could you do for my boy, hmm? I"
842,want something of finer quality. 
843,"DAHEER: Like yours, my lord? Then I can provide all the quality you"
844,"need. Jewelled tunics with fur collars, ruby-studded belts, quilted"
845,"sleeves, laced"
846,leather boots. 
847,"DOCTOR: Quite so, quite so, thank you, thank you. Now run away and have"
848,"a good think about it, and let me know in the morning what you've"
849,decided. 
850,"DAHEER: I will, my lord. And when the sun rises I shall be here to"
851,transform the boy into a veritable strutting peacock. And then perhaps
852,my lord will recommend the name of Ben Daheer to the King?

855,(Joanna comes down the stairs and stands in the doorway)

859,"it's a, hmm? "
860,JOANNA: Why have you deceived us? 
861,"DOCTOR: Oh, forgive me, your highness. This is my young ward. Having"
862,found ourselves in a hostile country I decided to use this disguise. 
863,"JOANNA: But we are not hostile. The open country, yes. Within reach of"

872,JOANNA: I saw the Chamberlain in the corridor. Bring him to me. 
873,(Vicki leaves.) 
874,JOANNA: You say you are grateful. I cannot command what I ask of you
875,"now nor will I, but I am in some"
876,quandary. 
877,"DOCTOR: Can I help you, madam? "
878,"JOANNA: I am my brother's favourite, yet now I find I am excluded from"
879,his confidence. I sense he's made a plan of which I am a part. 
880,"DOCTOR: May I ask, why, of all people here, you've come to me, hmm? "
881,"JOANNA: There's something new in you, yet something older than the sky"
882,itself. I sense that I can trust you. 
883,"DOCTOR: If there is a plan, my lady, I will find out what it is and"
884,"keep close in touch, hmm? "
885,JOANNA: Then I am satisfied. 
886,(Vicki and the Chamberlain enter. We see he is similar in appearance to
887,the Doctor.) 
888,"JOANNA: Ah, good Chamberlain. "
889,CHAMBERLAIN: Your Highness. 
890,JOANNA: Bid your servants go about the town and find nimble hands who
891,"will dress this child. Good weaving, well-spun cloth. The dresses shall"
892,be of silk and satins and brocaded stuff. 
893,"CHAMBERLAIN: Dresses? Silks? Satins? For the boy? I, I thought there"
894,"was some amusement, your Highness? "
895,"JOANNA: Did you, Chamberlain? "
896,(Joanna leaves.) 
897,CHAMBERLAIN: I don't understand! 
898,VICKI: It's perfectly simple. I'm a girl. 
899,CHAMBERLAIN: A girl? Dressed as a boy? Is nothing understandable these
900,"days? The dresses, silk, satins. Where's the money to come from? "
901,"DOCTOR: The household purse, hmm? "
902,(The Chamberlain leaves.) 
903,"VICKI: Thank goodness for that, I didn't really see myself as a"
904,veritable strutting peacock. 
905,"DOCTOR: Well, my dear, in one way I don't think things have turned out"
906,"too badly after all, hmm? "
907,"VICKI: How do you mean, in one way? "
908,DOCTOR: You will be much safer under Joanna's wing. 
909,"VICKI: I'll still see you, won't I? "
910,"DOCTOR: Of course, my child. "
911,"VICKI: I mean, Barbara's gone off, and then Ian. "
912,DOCTOR: Only temporarily. 
913,"VICKI: You wouldn't go off and leave me, would you? "
914,DOCTOR: What a question. 
915,"VICKI: I mean, your ship's the only home I've got now and I couldn't"
916,bear it if 
917,"DOCTOR: Ah, now, now, now. What is all this, eh, hmm? "
918,"VICKI: Well, when you said a good thing in one way I thought, well, I"
919,thought you meant that I was some sort of problem or something. 
920,"DOCTOR: Ah, surely you know me better than that, child? No, my"
921,reservation was that I might get entangled in court intrigue and that's
922,"going to be very, very dangerous. Very dangerous indeed. "

925,HAROUN: Safiya? Safiya. 
926,SAFIYA: Father! I have been so frightened. 
927,"HAROUN: My poor house is yours, Barbara. This is my daughter, Safiya."

929,food.

931,HAROUN: The soldiers of El Akir were the searchers in the street. You
932,must wait here until a quieter time. 
933,BARBARA: I don't want to endanger you. 
934,HAROUN: I am in constant danger. I have sworn to kill the Emir. 
935,BARBARA: El Akir? 
936,HAROUN: Yes. That vile and evil man. Last year my house was a fine and
937,"happy place. A gentle wife, a son who honoured and obeyed me, and two"
938,daughters who adorned whatever place they visited. Then El Akir came to
939,"Lydda and imposed his will. He desired my eldest daughter Maimuna, but"
940,I refused him. 
941,BARBARA: So he took her? 
942,"HAROUN: Yes. When Safiya and I were away, he came and burned my house."
943,My wife and son were put to the sword. 
944,BARBARA: Then why do you stay in Lydda? 
945,"HAROUN: I live for one thing alone, the death of El Akir. Now I will go"
946,out and see if the way is clear for your escape. 
947,BARBARA: No. Please. I just feel that I'm making things worse for you. 
948,"HAROUN: Rest here, I shall not be long. If danger threatens, Safiya"
949,"will hide you. But if the soldiers persist in their search, and you"
950,"think that they will find you, take this and use it. "
951,BARBARA: Kill her? 
952,"HAROUN: Yes, and afterwards yourself. "
953,BARBARA: No. 
954,HAROUN: You must. 
955,BARBARA: No. Life is better than this. 
956,HAROUN: You do not know El Akir. 
957,BARBARA: I couldn't do it. I 
958,HAROUN: You would not let them take Safiya? 
959,"BARBARA: No, of course I wouldn't. "
960,HAROUN: Then I'll leave the knife. 
961,(Haroun leaves. Safiya returns and Barbara hides the knife.) 
962,SAFIYA: Where has my father gone? 
963,"BARBARA: Oh, he, he went outside to see if the soldiers had gone. "
964,SAFIYA: More likely to ask more questions of our neighbours. 
965,BARBARA: Questions? I don't understand. 
966,"SAFIYA: My mother, my brother and my sister Maimuna disappeared last"
967,year. My father searches everywhere for them. We live in hope they will
968,return one day. 
969,BARBARA: Then you don't know where they are? 
970,SAFIYA: No. It is a strange mystery. They've gone away and we must
971,simply wait for their return. It is the will of Allah. You will eat? My
972,father's knife! 
973,"BARBARA: Oh yes, he just left it behind. "
974,SAFIYA: How strange. He never goes without it.

996,"LEICESTER: Tell me your plan, sire. A new demand of Saladin? A battle"
997,plan? A victory like Arsuf? 
998,"RICHARD: Not this time, no, my lord of Leicester. No, we've had another"
999,"thought. To give our sister's hand in marriage to Saphadin, brother of"
1000,"the Sultan, and so make an end to this war. "
1001,"DOCTOR: I am indeed glad. sir, to know that you are thinking in terms"
1002,of peace. 
1003,"LEICESTER: The princess to marry Saphadin? My lord, I beg you to"
1004,explain. 
1005,"RICHARD: We do not feel obliged to explain anything to anyone, my lord"
1006,of Leicester. We think our words were plain enough. 
1007,"DOCTOR: It is a good scheme, sire, if the princess agrees. "
1008,RICHARD: Joanna knows nothing of this matter. 
1009,DOCTOR: Will she agree? 
1010,"RICHARD: You should rather ask how can she refuse? To stem the blood,"
1011,"bind up the wounds and give a host of men lives and futures? Oh, now"
1012,there's a marriage contract to put sacrifice to shame and make a saint
1013,of any woman. 
1014,"LEICESTER: Sire, with all the strength at my command I urge you, sire,"
1015,to abandon this pretence of peace. 
1016,"DOCTOR: Pretence, sir? Here's an opportunity to save the lives of many"
1017,men and you do
1018,naught but turn it down without any kind of thought. What do you think
1019,you are doing? 
1020,LEICESTER: I speak as a soldier. Why are we here in this foreign land
1021,"if not to fight? The Devil's horde, Saracen and Turk, posses Jerusalem"
1022,and we will not wrest it from them with honeyed words. 
1023,"DOCTOR: With swords, I suppose? "
1024,"LEICESTER: Aye, with swords and lances, or the axe. "
1025,"DOCTOR: You stupid butcher! Can you think of nothing else but killing,"
1026,hmm? 
1027,"LEICESTER: You're a man for talk, I can see that. You like a table and"
1028,"a ring of men. A parley here, arrangements there, but when you men of"
1029,"eloquence have stunned each other with your words, we, we the soldiers,"
1030,have to face it out. On some half-started morning while you speakers
1031,"lie abed, armies settle everything, giving sweat, sinewed bodies, aye,"
1032,and life itself. 
1033,"DOCTOR: I admire bravery and loyalty, sir. You have both of these. But,"
1034,unfortunately you haven't any brain at all. I hate fools. 
1035,LEICESTER: A fool can match a coward any day. 
1036,RICHARD: Enough of this! You dare to flourish arms before your King?
1037,"Know this, my lord of Leicester. We will not be advised. We have"
1038,"decided on a pact with Saladin. If that fails, then a trial of arms."
1039,"But we have set our mind and heart upon this marriage, and it shall go"

1043,"SAPHADIN: Why do you smile, brother? Is it a trap? "
1044,SALADIN: No. The English King writes sincerely. It is so guileless it
1045,can only be genuine. 
1046,SAPHADIN: Think seriously about it. Alliance with Joanna would give me
1047,title to much land. Power over far off
1048,"countries. A glittering empire, brother! "
1049,SALADIN: I did not know you were so ambitious. 
1050,"SAPHADIN: I would be the name, yours would be the voice. "
1051,SALADIN: Ah. 
1052,SAPHADIN: Of course. 
1053,SALADIN: Of course. Do not look so troubled. I will humour you and let
1054,this proposition go ahead. But listen to me well. Strategy is worth a
1055,"hundred lances. Think brother, how does this proposed marriage help us"
1056,to win our future battles? 
1057,SAPHADIN: You do not mean to think of this alliance seriously. 
1058,SALADIN: If you can marry with this sister of the English King then do
1059,"so and I will help you to it. Go, write a letter. Say the idea pleases"
1060,both of us. 
1061,SAPHADIN: But yet you doubt it. 
1062,"SALADIN: Have England, France and all the rest come here to cheer a man"
1063,"and woman and a love match? No, this is a last appeal for peace from a"
1064,weary man. So you write your letter and I'll alert the armies. Then on
1065,"either day, the day of blissful union or the day of awful battle, we"
1066,will be prepared. 
1067,SAPHADIN: You are wise. I was wrong to doubt you.

1074,"search for the lady Barbara. The brave deserve their favours. Go,"

1280,"another little scheme. A little pot of honey, made from pounded dates"
1281,"and very, very sweet. There, my lord, a little bit on your wrists and a"
1282,"little bit on your chest. Now, over there is a hungry home, full of"
1283,ants that go wild for date honey. We must be generous to them. Lay a
1284,"little trail across the sand, like this. And I will sit in the shade of"
1285,the trees and dream of all the treasures I will get when the ants
1286,"discover you. If you crane your neck around, my lord, you will soon see"
1287,"what you take to be a black line along the honey. Why, you will be able"
1288,to see it getting closer and closer. My little ones! Such ecstasy! 
1289,[Richard's throne room]
1290,
1291,VICKI: It is not true and you know it isn't! 
1292,LEICESTER: But what is true is that you came here in disguise. First a
1293,boy and now you are a girl. 
1294,VICKI: He was just trying to protect me! 
1295,"LEICESTER: Protect you from the lord, the King? "
1296,VICKI: Oh! Where is the Princess? She knew all about this! 
1297,(The Doctor enters.) 
1298,DOCTOR: What is the meaning of this? 
1299,VICKI: He's had me brought here. 
1300,LEICESTER: I wish to question her. 
1301,"DOCTOR: You call yourself a nobleman, sir, yet it appears you enjoy"
1302,"bullying young girls, hmm?"
1303,"We are not the guilty ones here, and don't look away when I'm talking"
1304,"to you. You, sir! "
1305,"LEICESTER: I have the right to civility from you. What are you, knave"
1306,or commoner? Or are you perhaps a traitor? 
1307,VICKI: You! It was you who told the Princess! 
1308,LEICESTER: I'll have no more of this! 
1309,RICHARD: No more will we. 
1310,"DOCTOR: Your Majesty. I didn't realise you were there, sire. "
1311,"RICHARD: Good Leicester, this question time has reached its full"
1312,"conclusion. Go to your men, find out their quarrels and complaints, and"
1313,mend them with the best words at your command. 
1314,"LEICESTER: They understand a fight, my lord. "
1315,RICHARD: Then warn them one approaches. 
1316,"LEICESTER: Sire, I will. I'll turn them from a rabble into victors once"
1317,"again, and we shall set a noise of sharpening and polishing til the"
1318,"ground fare trembles with sound of axe and sword against the whetstone,"
1319,and the sun shall find a glittering home in every visor. 
1320,"RICHARD: Yes, do it. "
1321,(Leicester leaves.) 
1322,RICHARD: We know now that it was not you who told our sister. It's no
1323,"use, Joanna is right. We cannot fight Rome as well. In any other land I"
1324,could command the end and force my purpose. Not here. Not with Saphadin
1325,and Joanna.
1326,"No, once again we shall have to fight. "
1327,"DOCTOR: May I ask you something, sire? If you knew it was the Earl of"
1328,"Leicester that gave your marriage plans away to your sister, why didn't"
1329,"you accuse him, have it out with him then and there? "
1330,VICKI: You just let it go by without saying a word. It wasn't fair. I'm
1331,"sorry, your Majesty. "
1332,RICHARD: We accept the impeachment. We are unjust to you to serve the
1333,"greater good. You see, my Lord of Leicester is a hardy fighter, and a"
1334,"fight is near us now. When we meet the Saracen again, we shall need him"
1335,at our elbow. But do not be discouraged. You have our favour. 
1336,"DOCTOR: But I have made an enemy of him, sire. "
1337,"RICHARD: Yes, I fear you have. Therefore, it would be best to be gone"
1338,from here until the enmity is forgotten. 
1339,"DOCTOR: I think I agree, sire. "
1340,VICKI: Must we go? I don't want to. 
1341,RICHARD: Good! And we do not wish to see you leave. But you must. Go to
1342,Acre. Rest there. Wait until we call again upon your wisdom and your
1343,counsel. 
1344,"DOCTOR: We shall leave at once, sire. "
1345,"RICHARD: Meantime, I'll wrestle with the problem of this war. "
1346,"DOCTOR: There is something important, sire. If you are able to defeat"
1347,"Saladin in this battle, can you hold the city? "
1348,"RICHARD: Win the battle, lose the war. The greatest fear we have. We've"
1349,come so close. I must see Jerusalem. I must. 
1350,"DOCTOR: You will, sire. "
1351,RICHARD: You think so? 
1352,"DOCTOR: I am certain, sire. And when you look upon the city itself, you"
1353,will be able to find the answer to the problem of this war. May we now
1354,"take our leave, sire? "
1355,(Vicki and the Doctor move out of earshot of Richard.) 
1356,VICKI: Are we going back to the ship? 
1357,"DOCTOR: As fast as our legs can carry us, my dear. "
1358,"VICKI: Doctor, will he really see Jerusalem? "
1359,DOCTOR: Only from afar. He won't be able to capture it. Even now his
1360,armies are marching on a campaign that he can never win. 
1361,VICKI: That's terrible. Can't we tell him? 
1362,"DOCTOR: I'm afraid not, my dear. No, history must take its course. "
1363,(The Doctor and Vicki leave.) 
1364,"RICHARD: Help me, Holy Sepulchre. Help me. "
1365,[Desert]
1366,
1367,"IBRAHIM: You see, my master? The line of black is"
1368,getting nearer and nearer. Date honey is a great delicacy for our
1369,little friends. And I will return to the shade and leave you to your
1370,little friends. You have only to call. 
1371,[Seraglio]
1372,
1373,"BARBARA: Don't be upset, please. "
1374,MAIMUNA: My tears are tears of joy. All this time I believed that my
1375,father and sister were dead. El Akir had swore that they were. 
1376,BARBARA: He has a lot to answer for. 
1377,"MAIMUNA: Now I know why he told me they were dead. By keeping me here,"
1378,"he brought shame upon my family, and at first, I tried to kill myself"
1379,"to spare my father's honour. But when I believed him dead, I did not"
1380,even have the will to die. 
1381,"BARBARA: Listen, Maimuna, your father loves you. All he thinks about is"
1382,getting you away from this place. 
1383,MAIMUNA: Is that really true? 
1384,BARBARA: Yes. He told me so. 
1385,MAIMUNA: I thought he had despised me. 
1386,BARBARA: He hates El Akir. He wants to kill him and take you home. 
1387,MAIMUNA: There is no escape from this place. But we will hide you. El
1388,Akir is a stupid animal. He will not think to search for you here. 
1389,[Richard's palace]
1390,
1391,LEICESTER: You observed them leave the palace? 
1392,"SOLDIER: Aye, just now my lord. "
1393,LEICESTER: Take men and follow them discreetly. The old man tried to
1394,poison the King's mind. He may be in the pay of the infidel Saladin. He
1395,"may be worse. Some devil in a human form, the girl a witch. "
1396,"SOLDIER: A witch, my lord? "
1397,"LEICESTER: Take courage, man. No black art withstands a well-placed"
1398,sword. 
1399,[Desert]
1400,
1401,"(Carrion birds circle, and the ants approach) "
1402,"IBRAHIM: You see, my lord? They know when death is approaching. Already"
1403,there's the advanced guard has reached its little objective.
1404,(the ants have reached Ian's hand)  
1405,IAN: All right. I'll tell you. 
1406,IBRAHIM: First! First! First! 
1407,IAN: I have gold. 
1408,"IBRAHIM: Where? Speak up, speak up. "
1409,IAN: My boot. 
1410,IBRAHIM: Boot? 
1411,(Ibrahim cuts Ian's right foot free and takes the boot off.) 
1412,IBRAHIM: You are lying. There is nothing there. 
1413,IAN: The other boot. 
1414,"(Ibrahim frees Ian's left foot, and Ian is able kick Ibrahim over and"
1415,wrench his arms free. Both men struggle and Ian gets Ibrahim in an arm
1416,lock.) 
1417,"IAN: Where is Lydda? How far is it, because you're going to take me"
1418,there. 
1419,IBRAHIM: Not far. Walking distance. I live there myself. I'll show you.
1420,"I'll take you. Do not kill me, lord. Walking distance. "
1421,IAN: Walking? Where's my horse? 
1422,IBRAHIM: My brother took it. A miserable thief. 
1423,[Seraglio]
1424,
1425,MAIMUNA: Have you heard anything? 
1426,HAFSA: No. They must be somewhere else in the palace. 
1427,"MAIMUNA: Have a rest, now, Hafsa. Let one of the others listen. "
1428,BARBARA: The corridor outside. Where does it lead? 
1429,MAIMUNA: To the balcony. It overlooks the garden. 
1430,BARBARA: How far up from the ground? 
1431,"MAIMUNA: There is a tree, but "
1432,BARBARA: Can you reach it from the balcony? 
1433,MAIMUNA: There are guards below. 
1434,BARBARA: How far are the entrance gates from the tree? 
1435,"MAIMUNA: Not far, but there is no escape that way. The guards watch it"
1436,constantly. I'll show you from the window. 
1437,(The woman set to watch the corridor slips out unseen.) 
1438,"(Meanwhile, Haroun lurks outside the palace gates)"
1439,
1440,[El Akir's palace - corridor]
1441,
1442,EL AKIR: She cannot get out. Go and look again.
1443,You! Who gave you permission? 
1444,FATIMA: My lord. 
1445,EL AKIR: What is this insolence? 
1446,"FATIMA: You said a ruby ring, my lord. "
1447,EL AKIR: Where is she? 
1448,[El Akir's palace - main gates]
1449,
1450,(A guard lies on the ground) 
1451,IAN: He's dead. 
1452,IBRAHIM: Why do you steal his sword? 
1453,IAN: I'm going inside. El Akir has a friend of mine. I've got to find
1454,her. 
1455,"IBRAHIM: El Akir will kill you. He's a very, very bad man. "
1456,IAN: He's not the only one around here. Why do you say he's a bad man? 
1457,IBRAHIM: He has made the rich people so poor so there is no one left to
1458,"steal from. If you rid the world of him, you will be remembered as a"
1459,saviour. I shall not betray you. 
1460,"IAN: Oh, well in that case, perhaps you can do something for me. "
1461,"IBRAHIM: Anything, my lord, anything, anything. "
1462,"IAN: Yes, on second thoughts, it might be a little difficult for you. I"
1463,"wonder, do you think you could manage to, er, steal some horses for me?"
1464,
1465,"IBRAHIM: Now you are truly, truly my brother. While you keep El Akir"
1466,"occupied, I will steal the horses from his stables. "
1467,IAN: Good. 
1468,IBRAHIM: You can always trust Ibrahim. 
1469,[Seraglio]
1470,
1471,MAIMUNA: Fatima has betrayed us. You must get away.
1472,You will die if you stay here. 
1473,EL AKIR: You hid her from me! 
1474,BARBARA: Leave her alone! 
1475,EL AKIR: Now I shall show you how I deal with those who do not obey me!
1476,
1477,"(As El Akir raises his sword against Maimuna, he is stabbed in the"
1478,back.) 
1479,"MAIMUNA: Father! Oh, father! I believed you were dead. "
1480,HAROUN: There is great joy in my heart at seeing you. But come now.
1481,Your sister
1482,Safiya awaits you. 
1483,BARBARA: Is Safiya alright? 
1484,HAROUN: Yes. She told me of your sacrifice. I came here to give my life
1485,"for you, my lady. "
1486,BARBARA: How did you get in here? 
1487,(Fatima enters and screams followed by Ian) 
1488,IAN: Barbara! 
1489,HAROUN: Get back! The guard! 
1490,(Haroun and Ian overpower a guard who rushes in.) 
1491,HAROUN: Quickly! Make haste. We must not stay here. 
1492,"IAN: Barbara, quickly. "
1493,(Ian and Barbara leave. The other women gather around Fatima.) 
1494,FATIMA: No! No! No! No!
1495,
1496,[El Akir's palace - main gates]
1497,
1498,"IBRAHIM: You see? I was right, my lord. You did"
1499,have gold. 
1500,IAN: I acquired it. 
1501,IBRAHIM: Like I acquired the horses. 
1502,IAN: Yes. 
1503,"IBRAHIM: Now you are my truly, truly brother. "
1504,"BARBARA: Ian, we must get back to the ship. "
1505,"IAN: Yes, alright. Farewell, Ibrahim. Don't go acquiring too many"
1506,things. 
1507,"HAROUN: Ride well, my brother. May Allah go with you. "
1508,(Ian and Barbara ride off.) 
1509,"IBRAHIM: Really, such talent. He has such an honest face. We could have"
1510,made a fortune. 
1511,"HAROUN: We must not stand here dreaming, you half-wit. The soldiers"
1512,will be around us. 
1513,IBRAHIM: This half-wit has stolen all their horses. 
1514,"HAROUN: They can still use their legs, can't they? "
1515,[Wood]
1516,
1517,"(Night sounds, owls and crickets. Richard's"
1518,"soldiers stand guard between Vicki and the Doctor, and the Tardis a"
1519,little way away.) 
1520,DOCTOR: They're between us and the ship. 
1521,VICKI: Are these the soldiers who followed us? 
1522,"DOCTOR: Yes, they are. I wonder what they're up to? "
1523,VICKI: Can we go round? 
1524,"DOCTOR: No, there's too many of them. Perhaps we can try? No, we can't"
1525,do that. 
1526,VICKI: Why not? What's happening? 
1527,DOCTOR: Now I know why we've been followed. 
1528,LEICESTER: Your messenger arrived. So they are traitors and making
1529,toward Saladin's encampment. 
1530,"SOLDIER: So it seemed to me, my lord. "
1531,"LEICESTER: Armed as they are with secrets, they are dangerous enemies."
1532,Do you have the wood encircled? 
1533,SOLDIER: Yes. They can't get away. 
1534,LEICESTER: The shadows are the only friends they have. We'll find them
1535,at daybreak. 
1536,"DOCTOR: It's that meddling fool, Leicester. We've got to try and slip"
1537,"through them. Remember, not a sound. Not a sound. In you go. "
1538,(Vicki gets to the Tardis.) 
1539,SOLDIER: Hold! Hold! 
1540,"DOCTOR: Take your hands off me, sir! What are you doing? Unhand me! How"
1541,dare you! 
1542,(Vicki and Barbara are outside the Tardis) 
1543,VICKI: They've caught him! They've caught him! 
1544,"BARBARA: Vicki, it's all right. We'll get him away. "
1545,VICKI: But how? What can we do? 
1546,"LEICESTER: So, I thought you'd show yourself. "
1547,"DOCTOR: What is the meaning of this, sir? The King gave me leave to go."
1548,
1549,LEICESTER: To Saladin? 
1550,"IAN: You are right, my lord. His treachery is well-paid by Saladin. He"
1551,is a Saracen spy. 
1552,"LEICESTER: The truth at last. But I do not know you, sir. "
1553,"IAN: I am Sir Ian, my lord, Knight of Jaffa. I know this villain's"
1554,"treachery, and hearing that you were looking for him, I followed you. "
1555,LEICESTER: To watch his execution? 
1556,"IAN: No, my lord. To administer it. "
1557,"LEICESTER: It is a paltry matter to be rid of him, but I would do it. "
1558,"IAN: It is no paltry matter to me, my lord. Some friends of mind were"
1559,"ambushed here. De Marun, de Tornebu. He's to blame. My lord, I beg of"
1560,"you, let me finish him. "
1561,"LEICESTER: Yours is the greater claim. Dispatch him then, and quickly. "
1562,"DOCTOR: Gentlemen, since I am to depart so punctiliously, I would ask"
1563,you to grant me one last wish. 
1564,LEICESTER: Granted. 
1565,DOCTOR: Thank you. I would like to look once more upon the city of
1566,Jaffa. Then you may do what you will with me. 
1567,LEICESTER: Granted. 
1568,"DOCTOR: Thank you, my lord. "
1569,IAN: My lord. 
1570,(and they walk away from Leicester to the Tardis) 
1571,"IAN: Hurry, Doctor, hurry! "
1572,DOCTOR: What about that performance? 
1573,"BARBARA: Doctor, open the door! "
1574,(They all enter the Tardis) 
1575,SOLDIER: Shh! Do you hear a voice? 
1576,LEICESTER: A voice? 
1577,SOLDIER: A woman's voice. 
1578,LEICESTER: Have we been tricked? 
1579,(They get to the Tardis as it dematerialises. They cross themselves in
1580,fear.) 
1581,LEICESTER: We will not speak of this. Let this story die here in this
1582,"wood or we'll be branded idiots, or liars. Poor Sir Ian, brave fellow."
1583,Spirited away by fiends. What dreadful anguish and despair he must be
1584,suffering now. 
1585,[Tardis] 
1586,"IAN: Any more cracks about knighthood, and I'll"
1587,carry out that execution. 
1588,"DOCTOR: Well, my dear boy, I must say I think you've earned a good"
1589,knight's sleep. 
1590,"DOCTOR: Now, I suppose, the Tardis will materialise when it's ready. "
1591,"BARBARA: Yes, and where it likes. "
1592,"DOCTOR: Oh, my dear young woman, why don't you go have a cup of tea or"
1593,something. 
1594,(The Tardis goes dark except for the control column.) 
1595,IAN: What's happening? 
1596,DOCTOR: I don't know.
