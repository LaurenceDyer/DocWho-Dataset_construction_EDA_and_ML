21, [UNIT Tracking station]
22,
23," (On Earth, a bored, sweaty, uniformed radar"
24,operative sees a line of dots appear on his screen. He grabs the
25,internal telephone.) 
26,"TECHNICIAN: Duty Officer, please. Urgent. "
27,(A woman in the same uniform enters.) 
28,OFFICER: What is it? 
29,"TECHNICIAN: I've got something on here, ma'am. Something strange. "
30,OFFICER: Are you sure it's not just interference? Something to do with
31,the heat wave? 
32,"TECHNICIAN: No, ma'am. There's something on there. "
33,OFFICER: Scan closer. Still very high. 
34,"TECHNICIAN: Coming down fast though, ma'am, and heading this way. "
35,OFFICER: They must be meteorites. 
36,TECHNICIAN: But they're flying in formation. 
37,(Vapour trails in formation are formed in the atmosphere. In Oxley
38,"Woods, a poacher is concealing a snare trap when he looks up to see a"
39,group of very artificial objects whistling down towards him. He dives
40,for cover. Boom.) 
41,TECHNICIAN: They've come down. 
42,OFFICER: Where? 
43,TECHNICIAN: Sector five. Epping. 
44,OFFICER: Bearing? 
45,"TECHNICIAN: Just working it out. You know, I still think it was a"
46,"formation, ma'am. There was a shape. "
47,(The poacher uses a stick to prod at the smoking area where the object
48,landed. He reveals a pulsating light under the layer of steaming hot
49,"soil, so he covers it over again.) "
50,OFFICER: Control have reported that meteorite storm to UNIT HQ. 
51,TECHNICIAN: So Control didn't think they were meteorites either? 
52,OFFICER: What else could they be? Don't let your imagination run away
53,with you. 
54,TECHNICIAN: I suppose they must have been meteorites. Mustn't
55,they? 
56,(The Tardis materialises in Oxley Woods. The door opens and a
57,grey-haired figure falls face down into the heather.)
58,
59, [Brigadier's office]
60,
61, (A woman with her red hair in a tight bun is
62,"chauffeured through an underground area, past a checkpoint. The office"
63,is at the end of a corridor with vent ducting along it.) 
64,"BRIGADIER: Yes, ask her to come in. "
65,(He greets the woman at the door.) 
66,"BRIGADIER: Ah, good. Miss Shaw, I'm Lethbridge-Stewart. Do come in and"
67,"sit down, will you? "
68,LIZ: Was all that nonsense out there really necessary? Identity passes?
69,Guards? I was even searched. 
70,"BRIGADIER: Security. Rather amusing, don't you think? No, you don't. "
71,LIZ: I have an important research programme going ahead at Cambridge. 
72,"BRIGADIER: Yes, I know. An expert in meteorites, degrees in medicine,"
73,physics and a dozen other subjects. Just the sort of all-rounder I've
74,been looking for. 
75,LIZ: How I feel doesn't matter? 
76,"BRIGADIER: We need your help, Miss Shaw. "
77,LIZ: I'm just not interested in security work. 
78,BRIGADIER: Security? 
79,LIZ: Producing invisible ink. That sort of thing. 
80,BRIGADIER: We're not exactly spies here at UNIT. 
81,"LIZ: Then what do you do, exactly? "
82,"BRIGADIER: We deal with the odd, the unexplained, anything on Earth, or"
83,even beyond. 
84,LIZ: Alien invaders? Little blue men with three heads? 
85,BRIGADIER: Ten tons of alien material drift through space and land on
86,this planet every day. 
87,LIZ: And do no harm to anyone. 
88,BRIGADIER: Early this morning a shower of about fifty meteorites landed
89,in Essex. 
90,LIZ: Landed? Most meteorites don't even reach the Earth's surface. They
91,usually burn up in the atmosphere. 
92,BRIGADIER: These didn't. These particular meteorites came down through
93,"a funnel of thin, super-heated air about twenty miles in diameter, for"
94,which no one has an explanation. 
95,"LIZ: There must be an explanation, a natural one. "
96,BRIGADIER: I hope so. We didn't find one last time. 
97,LIZ: Last time? 
98,"BRIGADIER: Six months ago, a smaller shower of meteorites, about five"
99,"or six, landed in the same area. "
100,"LIZ: No, that's impossible. The odds against two lots of meteorites"
101,landing in exactly the same place must be incredible. 
102,"BRIGADIER: They are, Miss Shaw. They are."
103,
104, [Ashbridge cottage hospital]
105,
106, (A UNIT officer is with a doctor as a man is
107,carried in on a stretcher.) 
108,HENDERSON: You've no idea who he is? 
109,"MUNRO: Not a clue. We found him unconscious beside a police box, of all"
110,things. 
111,HENDERSON: In the middle of the woods? 
112,MUNRO: Yes. We thought he was dead at first. 
113,"HENDERSON: I see. Well, I'd better go and have a look at him."
114,
115, [Brigadier's office]
116,
117, BRIGADIER: Figures from the Institute of Space
118,"Studies, Baltimore. Do you realise that in our section of the galaxy,"
119,there are over five hundred planets capable of supporting life? 
120,LIZ: Why is Earth any more likely to be attacked now than during the
121,last fifty thousand years? 
122,"BRIGADIER: In the last decade, we've been sending probes deeper and"
123,"deeper into space. We've drawn attention to ourselves, Miss Shaw. "
124,LIZ: Aren't you being a bit alarmist? 
125,"BRIGADIER: Since UNIT was formed, there've been two attempts to invade"
126,this planet. 
127,LIZ: Really? 
128,BRIGADIER: We were lucky enough to be able to stop them. There was a
129,policy decision not to inform the public. 
130,LIZ: Do you seriously expect me to believe that? 
131,"BRIGADIER: It's not my habit to tell lies, Miss Shaw. "
132,"LIZ: I'm sorry, but it is a fantastic story. "
133,BRIGADIER: We were very lucky on both occasions. We had help from a
134,scientist with a great experience of other life forms. 
135,LIZ: Really? Who was this genius? 
136,"BRIGADIER: Well, it's all rather difficult to explain. We used to call"
137,him the Doctor. 
138,(A phone buzzes.) 
139,BRIGADIER: Yes?
140,
141, [Ashbridge cottage hospital]
142,
143,(Captain Munro is reporting in using the public pay
144,phone.) 
145,"MUNRO: Munro here, sir. I'm in the Ashbridge Cottage Hospital."
146,
147, [Brigadier's office]
148,
149, BRIGADIER: What the dickens are you doing there?
150,Have you found any of those meteorites?
151,
152, [Ashbridge cottage hospital]
153,
154," MUNRO: No, sir. All we've found is an unconscious"
155,civvy. 
156,BRIGADIER : Well? 
157,"MUNRO: He was lying beside a police box, sir. Abandoned, by the look of"
158,"it, right in the middle of Oxley Wood."
159,
160, [Brigadier's office]
161,
162," BRIGADIER: A police box? Munro, this man you"
163,found. 
164,"MUNRO : He's here at the hospital, sir, undergoing treatment. "
165,BRIGADIER : Has he said anything? 
166,"MUNRO : No, sir. Not a syllable. He's out to the wide. "
167,"BRIGADIER: Listen, Munro. I want an armed guard put on that police box"
168,"at once. Nobody is to be allowed near it, do you understand? Nobody."
169,
170, [Ashbridge cottage hospital]
171,
172," MUNRO: A guard, sir? Very well, sir. Oh, do you"
173,"want the police told, sir, about the police box? They may want it back."
174,
175, [Brigadier's office]
176,
177, BRIGADIER: On no account. I'm coming down there
178,"immediately. In the meantime, carry on with the search. "
179,
180, [Ashbridge cottage hospital ward]
181,
182, (A nurse puts an x-ray on a light box for Doctor
183,Henderson to see.) 
184,"NURSE: Ready, sir. "
185,"HENDERSON: Thank you, nurse. Is this somebody's idea of a joke? "
186,NURSE: Sir? 
187,HENDERSON: Look at that. 
188,"NURSE: His heart, sir. "
189,"HENDERSON: If that is his heart, nurse, what is this. "
190,"NURSE: I, I don't know, sir. "
191,HENDERSON: Someone in the x-ray department having a game. You stay with
192,the patient. I'll find out who the fool is.
193,
194, [Ashbridge cottage hospital corridor]
195,
196, (Henderson pushes past Mullins the welsh porter
197,vacuuming the carpet. His bleeper goes off as he gets near an internal
198,telephone so he picks up the handset and dials zero.) 
199,HENDERSON: Henderson here. 
200,(He signals Mullins to turn off the vacuum cleaner.) 
201,HENDERSON: Doctor Henderson here. You're calling me? 
202,"LOMAX : (scottish) Look here, Henderson, what's the idea of playing"
203,stupid tricks? 
204,HENDERSON: Me playing tricks? Who is that? 
205,"LOMAX : Doctor Lomax, path lab. You just sent up a blood sample for"
206,cross matching. 
207,"HENDERSON: Yes, that's right. Just routine. "
208,"LOMAX : Listen, Henderson, I will not tolerate stupid practical"
209,jokes. It wasn't human blood and you know it. 
210,"HENDERSON: What do you mean, not human blood? I took it from the"
211,patient myself. 
212,LOMAX : It is not a human blood type. The platelet stickiness shows
213,"that. Henderson, are you there? Hello? "
214,"HENDERSON: Doctor Lomax, I took that blood sample from an adult male"
215,patient. Now you tell me it's not human blood. I don't know if that
216,"makes me a doctor or a vet, but it's still my job to look after him. "
217,(Henderson puts the phone down and leaves.)
218,
219, [Ashbridge cottage hospital]
220,
221, (Mullins goes to the public pay phone.) 
222,"MULLINS: Oh, hello. Is that the Daily Chronicle? It is? Well, look, my"
223,name's Mullins. I'm a porter at the Cottage Hospital in Ashbridge. I
224,"understand you pay for stories. You do? Well, look, there's something"
225,very funny happening up here.
226,
227, [Oxley Wood]
228,
229, (The poacher has returned with a shovel and sack.
230,"The ground has stopped smoking now, and he digs up the pulsing, beeping"
231,one foot diameter object. He puts it in the sack then hears voices and
232,goes into some nearby bushes.) 
233,FORBES : Keep on your track. 
234,(UNIT soldiers are scanning the ground with detectors.) 
235,FORBES: Move over. Keep in a straight line. 
236,(The poacher returns to his sack and leaves.) 
237,FORBES : Have you got something there?
238,
239, [Ashbridge cottage hospital ward]
240,
241, (The patient is restless. He hangs over the side
242,"of his bed, looking underneath it.) "
243,NURSE: What are you doing? 
244,DOCTOR: Shoes. Must find my shoes. 
245,"NURSE: Oh no, you can't get up. Come on. "
246,"DOCTOR: Unhand me, madam. "
247,HENDERSON: What's happening? 
248,NURSE: He tried to get out of bed. 
249,HENDERSON: What? 
250,NURSE: He's unconscious again now. 
251,(And we still haven't properly seen his face.)
252,
253, [Ashbridge cottage hospital]
254,
255, (The Brigadier and Liz arrive in his staff car
256,with a pennant fluttering from the bonnet. There is a press scrum in
257,the reception area.) 
258,WAGSTAFFE: Why can't we see him? 
259,MUNRO: He's under medical care. 
260,"WAGSTAFFE: Is that the real reason? Well, what are you chaps doing"
261,here? 
262,MUNRO: I'm sorry. I can't answer questions. 
263,REPORTER: Why not? Is it a security order? 
264,WAGSTAFFE: Has it anything to do with those meteorites? 
265,MUNRO: I'm sorry. There's simply nothing I can tell you. 
266,(A man with a very impassive face is watching proceedings as the
267,Brigadier and Liz enter.) 
268,"MULLINS: Look, stand back there now. Stand back. Let him through! "
269,"WAGSTAFFE: Michael Wagstaffe, defence correspondent on the Daily Post. "
270,"REPORTER: Can you tell us anything, sir? "
271,BRIGADIER: What about? 
272,"WAGSTAFFE: Er, what's UNIT doing here, sir? Is it true there's a man"
273,from space in there? 
274,BRIGADIER: Nonsense. I don't know where you get these stories. 
275,REPORTER: We heard there's something odd about him. 
276,BRIGADIER: I know nothing about a man from space. 
277,"WAGSTAFFE: Then why are you here, sir? "
278,BRIGADIER: Training exercise. 
279,"MULLINS: Stand back, now. Let him through. Stand back now. "
280,REPORTER: Has your visit any connection with the meteorites that fell
281,last night? Is that why you've cordoned off the wood? 
282,WAGSTAFFE: Did the man who was brought in here find one of the
283,meteorites? 
284,REPORTER: Was he injured by them? 
285,WAGSTAFFE: Are these meteorites dangerous? 
286,BRIGADIER: I'm sorry. I'll talk to you later when 
287,"WAGSTAFFE: Has he found it and hidden it away, perhaps? "
288,"BRIGADIER: If there's a story, you'll be given it later. At the moment,"
289,I have no comment to make. 
290,"MULLINS: All right, come on, stand back now, boys. No, boys, I can't"
291,"let you go in there. It's more than my job's worth. Right now, clear"
292,away now. 
293,WAGSTAFFE: I think I've put my finger on it. That chap's found one of
294,those meteorites and won't tell them where it is.
295,
296, [Ashbridge cottage hospital corridor]
297,
298, BRIGADIER: How did that lot get onto this? 
299,"MUNRO: No idea, sir. They just appeared like swallows in the spring. "
300,BRIGADIER: Have you put a guard on that police box? 
301,"MUNRO: Yes, sir. Two men with orders to keep strangers well away. "
302,"BRIGADIER: Oh, Munro, see that they're issued with live ammunition,"
303,will you? 
304,MUNRO: Live ammunition? But sir 
305,"BRIGADIER: That's an order, Captain. "
306,"MUNRO: I'll see to it, sir. "
307,BRIGADIER: Good. 
308,"MUNRO: Along here, sir. "
309,BRIGADIER: Thank you.
310,
311, [Ashbridge cottage hospital ward]
312,
313,(We see our time traveller's new face as he sleeps
314,peacefully. Welcome Jon Pertwee to the show.) 
315,"MUNRO: Oh, Doctor Henderson, this is Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and,"
316,er? 
317,LIZ: Elizabeth Shaw. 
318,"BRIGADIER: Well, how's your patient, doctor? Can we see him? "
319,"HENDERSON: Well, you can see him, certainly. He's not making much sense"
320,yet. 
321,"BRIGADIER: What, still unconscious, eh? "
322,HENDERSON: Most of the time. He has brief moments of consciousness and
323,then slips back again. 
324,"LIZ: Well, what's actually wrong with him? "
325,HENDERSON: I can't say. Never had a patient quite like him before. 
326,LIZ: How do you mean? 
327,"HENDERSON: Well, his whole cardiovascular system is quite unlike"
328,anything I've ever seen. And I'm told his blood can't be identified. 
329,BRIGADIER: Splendid. That sounds like the Doctor. 
330,(The Brigadier goes over to the bed and rolls the man to see his face.)
331,
332,LIZ: Do you know him? 
333,"BRIGADIER: What? No, I thought I might do, but he's a complete"
334,stranger. I've never seen him before in my life. 
335,(The Doctor wakes.) 
336,"DOCTOR: Lethbridge-Stewart? My dear fellow, how nice to see you again. "
337,"MUNRO: He knows you, sir. "
338,BRIGADIER: But he can't do. Look here. Can you hear me? Who are you? 
339,DOCTOR: Don't you recognise me? 
340,BRIGADIER: I'm positive we've never met before. 
341,"DOCTOR: Oh, dear. Oh, I can't have changed that much, surely? Oh, I"
342,"must see what they've done to me. Can I borrow, can I borrow a mirror,"
343,please? 
344,(Liz hands over a compact mirror.) 
345,"DOCTOR: Thank you. Oh, no! Oh, no. Well, that's not me at all. No"
346,"wonder you didn't recognise me. Oh, that face. That hair. Oh, I don't"
347,"know, though. I think it's rather distinctive, actually. Don't you"
348,"think? No, you don't. Oh, anyway, I'm tired. All this exercise and"
349,exertion. It's been too much. Have to get some sleep now. 
350,"BRIGADIER: Now, just a minute. Wake up, man. Listen to me. "
351,HENDERSON: I think that's quite enough for the moment. His mind's
352,"obviously disturbed. Anyway, I'm afraid he's out again. "
353,"BRIGADIER: Extraordinary business. Munro, I want this man brought to"
354,London HQ. When will he be fit to travel? 
355,HENDERSON: Difficult to say. 
356,"BRIGADIER: I see. Well, as soon as possible, Munro. In the meantime,"
357,carry on the search for these meteorites. 
358,"MUNRO: Very good, sir. "
359,BRIGADIER: Is there another way out of here? I want to avoid the press
360,if possible. 
361,HENDERSON: This way. 
362,"BRIGADIER: Thank you. (Henderson, the Brigadier and Liz leave. The"
363,Doctor opens his eyes.)
364,
365, [Ashbridge cottage hospital]
366,
367, (A car is heard driving away.) 
368,WAGSTAFFE: Lethbridge-Stewart. He must have nipped out the back way. 
369,REPORTER: So he's not going to tell us anything. 
370,"WAGSTAFFE: You know, there's a story here, Jimmy. They're trying to"
371,cover something. 
372,"REPORTER: Porter, when can we see Doctor Henderson? "
373,"MULLINS: Hey, look now, it's no good asking me. You'll just have to"
374,"wait, so there. "
375,WAGSTAFFE: I'm going to ring the office. 
376,(But the phone is occupied by the impassive man.) 
377,"WAGSTAFFE: Who is this chap, anyway? He's been hanging around for ages."
378,
379,REPORTER: I don't know. I've never seen him before. 
380,WAGSTAFFE: Did he tell you which paper he was on? 
381,"MULLINS: Oh, him? No, he didn't tell me anything. He came in with the"
382,rest of you. I thought he was one of you lot. 
383,"WAGSTAFFE: Excuse me, sir. Are you going to be much longer? You see,"
384,we've got some stories to phone through and we'd like to use the phone
385,if possible. 
386,"(The man becomes alert, realises the receiver is still on its cradle"
387,and leaves.)
388,
389, [Oxley Wood]
390,
391, (The poacher is approaching the alert UNIT
392,soldiers.) 
393,"SEELEY: Don't point that thing at me, mister. "
394,FORBES: Where do you think you're going? 
395,SEELEY: Home. I belong these parts. 
396,FORBES: How did you get into this wood? It's restricted. 
397,SEELEY: You fancy buying a rabbit or two? 
398,"FORBES: Oh, you're a poacher, are you? "
399,SEELEY: Ain't nothing so tasty as fresh rabbit. A bit of salt and a few
400,onions. 
401,FORBES: Didn't you see the patrols on the road? 
402,"SEELEY: Ah, but I reckon they never seen me. "
403,"FORBES: All right, dad, get on your way, but don't come back until this"
404,wood it's de-restricted. You understand? 
405,"SEELEY: You soldiers looking for them thunderballs, eh? "
406,FORBES: That's our business. 
407,"SEELEY: Reckon if I know where to find one of them things, it'd be"
408,"worth a tidy old bit, eh? "
409,FORBES: You know where one landed? 
410,"SEELEY: I didn't say that, did I, son? I'm just asking. "
411,"FORBES: Yeah, well, don't ask. Go on, push off."
412,
413, [Ashbridge cottage hospital ward]
414,
415, DOCTOR: My shoes? Where are my shoes? I must find
416,my shoes. 
417,(The nurse is taking his pulse and tries to pull him back onto the
418,bed.) 
419,DOCTOR: I must find my shoes. 
420,NURSE: Why? You don't need them. You're not going anywhere. 
421,"DOCTOR: You don't understand, madam. It's most important. "
422,"HENDERSON: How is he, nurse? "
423,"NURSE: His pulse seems to have settled down, sir. Ten a minute. "
424,"HENDERSON: Yes, well, the trouble is, we don't know what's normal for"
425,"him, do we? Hello! How are you feeling? "
426,DOCTOR: Shoes. 
427,HENDERSON: I beg your pardon? 
428,DOCTOR: Shoes. 
429,"NURSE: They seem to be worrying him, sir. I think he believes they've"
430,been stolen. 
431,"HENDERSON: Well, if he wants them, he might as well. Where are they,"
432,nurse? 
433,NURSE: In his locker. 
434,(Henderson takes a pair of black shiny shoes from the bedside locker.) 
435,HENDERSON: Ah! Are these what you're looking for? 
436,"(The Doctor grabs them and rolls over, clutching the shoes to his"
437,chest.) 
438,HENDERSON: I wonder if the brain's damaged? 
439,NURSE: He does seem to be behaving very erratically. 
440,"HENDERSON: Fetch the sphyg, would you, nurse? I'll take his blood"
441,pressure again while I'm here. 
442,(Henderson sits at a table to make his notes. The Doctor shakes his
443,shoes and a key falls out. He puts the shoes under his pillow and lies
444,down again.) 
445,"HENDERSON: Thank you, nurse. "
446,"(Footsteps have entered, it is not the nurse. One man karate-chops"
447,Henderson and the other puts tape over the Doctor's mouth. They knock
448,"him out, put him into a wheelchair and head off down the corridors.)"
449,
450, [Ashbridge cottage hospital corridor]
451,
452," (A short while later, Henderson staggers along to"
453,be met by Munro.) 
454,MUNRO: Doctor? What's wrong? What's happened? 
455, [Outside the hospital]

501,BRIGADIER: Unconscious? 
502,"HENDERSON: Yes, he's more unconscious than anyone I've ever seen. Have"
503,a look at this EEG. 
504,BRIGADIER: EEG? 
505,HENDERSON: This machine registers the electrical activity of the brain.
506,"Normally the line fluctuates considerably, even when the patient is"
507,unconscious. 
508,"MUNRO: Not a lot going on, is there? "
509,HENDERSON: Nothing whatsoever. Completely passive. 
510,BRIGADIER: Perhaps that bullet did more damage than you suspected? 
511,"HENDERSON: No, that only caused a slight burn on the scalp. It couldn't"
512,possibly account for this condition. 
513,BRIGADIER: Then what is the cause? Could it be shock? 
514,"HENDERSON: Could be, but I doubt it. No, he's is such a deep coma that"
515,I'd say it is 
516,BRIGADIER: Is what? 
517,HENDERSON: Self-induced. 
518,BRIGADIER: Is that possible? 
519,"HENDERSON: For you or for me, no. But we're dealing here with a"
520,completely alien physiology. All I can do is guess. 
521,"BRIGADIER: Well, is it safe to move him? "
522,"HENDERSON: I honestly don't know, but I'd advise against it. "
523,"BRIGADIER: Oh, very well. You'll keep me informed of any change in his"
524,condition? 
525,"HENDERSON: Yes, of course. "
526,BRIGADIER: Thank you. 
527,"HENDERSON: Oh, by the way. "
528,BRIGADIER: Yes?

539,"MUNRO: Here we are, sir. "
540,(Munro lifts an ammunition box onto a classic balustrade by the path.) 
541,"MUNRO: It's all we could find, sir. It must have broken up when it hit"
542,the ground. 
543,(It is a transparent section of the cover of one of the objects.) 
544,"BRIGADIER: It's light, very light. "
545,"MUNRO: Some sort of plastic, sir? "
546,"BRIGADIER: Yes, possibly. I'll take it back with me. Have it taken to"
547,"my car, will you? "
548,"MUNRO: Yes, sir. Hawkins. "
549,"(With the order passed on to a soldier, Munro and the Brigadier walk"
550,on.) 
551,BRIGADIER: Keep a twenty four hour guard. It's possible these people
552,might try again. 
553,"MUNRO: Right, sir. "
554,BRIGADIER: What puzzles me is why they should want to abduct the
555,Doctor. 
556,"MUNRO: Could he be tied up with them in any way, sir? "
557,"BRIGADIER: Yes, it's possible. Anyone get a good look at them? "
558,"MUNRO: I've got a picture of one of them, sir. He was here earlier"
559,posing as a reporter. 
560,(Munro takes out a picture of the Brigadier when he arrived at the
561,"hospital, with the impassive man behind him.) "
562,BRIGADIER: How did you get this? 
563,"MUNRO: I made a check on all the press men, sir. One of the"
564,"photographers took this shot when you arrived with Miss Shaw, and two"
565,of the nurses saw this man leading the raiding party. 
566,BRIGADIER: What about the others? 
567,"MUNRO: I only got a glimpse of them, sir. There was something odd about"
568,their faces.

590,RANSOME: Weren't you? What's all this about? 
591,(Ransome puts a letter on Hibbert's desk.) 
592,HIBBERT: The letter explains everything. 
593,"RANSOME: It explains nothing! Look. When I invented this doll, you"
594,promised me full backing. You sent me to the States to interest the
595,"Americans in joint production. You said, that if it all worked out,"
596,"you'd make me a partner. Well, here it all is. Agreements ready to"
597,"sign, advance orders, the lot. And what do I find on the mat when I get"
598,"home? A letter giving me the push. Look, we worked on this project"
599,"together. Well, you helped me finish the designs. Now you've put the"
600,"chop on it just like that. For heaven's sake, George, you owe me some"
601,sort of explanation. 
602,"HIBBERT: It's er, it's the new policy. We've, er, got a new policy. "
603,"RANSOME: What's happened to this place? Most of the staff gone,"
604,security notices everywhere. 
605,"HIBBERT: We're developing a new process. It's all very secret. We've,"
606,"er, changed everything. "
607,RANSOME: I'll say you have. The whole layout of the factory floor is
608,"different. And my workshop, what's in there now? "
609,"HIBBERT: Stay away from there, John. "
610,RANSOME: But what about my equipment? 
611,"HIBBERT: We'll, we'll send it to you. "
612,RANSOME: Just like that? 
613,"HIBBERT: I don't think you should have come here, John. You must go"
614,away at once. It's not safe. 
615,RANSOME: What's the matter? You keeping saying we. We've got a new

619,Goodbye. 
620,"RANSOME: Look, if there's anything wrong, perhaps I can help you? "
621,HIBBERT: (impassive) There's nothing wrong. My letter explained
622,everything. Goodbye. 
623,"(Ransome takes his letter and leaves, staring the impassive man right"

635,"LIZ: Fine, just fine. "
636,"BRIGADIER: Sorry about the makeshift conditions here, but we had to set"
637,this lab up for you in rather a hurry. 
638,"LIZ: Fine, fine. "
639,BRIGADIER: Found out what it's made of? 
640,"LIZ: No, but it isn't a meteorite. "
641,BRIGADIER: You've established that much? 
642,LIZ: Meteorites are the debris from comets. This has been manufactured.
643,
644,(She places the shard in a beaker of solution.) 
645,BRIGADIER: And it comes from space? 
646,LIZ: There are some faint traces of heat fusion. It's possible. 
647,BRIGADIER: Still sceptical? 
648,"LIZ: Of course. I deal with facts, not science fiction ideas. "
649,"BRIGADIER: Miss Shaw, I'm not a fool. I don't chase shadows. What you"
650,"don't understand is that there might, there is a remote possibility"
651,that outside your cosy little world other things could exist. 
652,LIZ: No need to get tetchy. 
653,"BRIGADIER: Well, sometimes you can be very aggravating. "
654,LIZ: Me? What about you? You really believe in a man who's helped to
655,save the world twice? With the power to transform his physical
656,appearance? 
657,BRIGADIER: I'm not sure yet. It may not be the same man.

663,(The impassive man finally speaks.) 
664,CHANNING: All you have to do is to continue running the factory as
665,"though nothing had changed. That is your sole concern, Hibbert. Do you"
666,understand? 
667,HIBBERT: I understand. 
668,CHANNING: Good. Two energy units are still missing. 
669,HIBBERT: Do you think the stranger at the hospital has found one of
670,them? 
671,CHANNING: It's possible but it is dangerous to go near him again. 
672,HIBBERT: Then what can you do? 
673,CHANNING: The units may have embedded themselves in soft ground. That
674,would account for the fact that their signals are no longer being
675,received. 
676,HIBBERT: How will you locate them then? 
677,CHANNING: They will increase their pulsation signals. 
678,HIBBERT: You talk about these energy units as though they were living

697,(Meg opens the chest.) 
698,"SEELEY: Satisfied? Now go and get me some grub, woman. I'm hungry. "

901,could I possible what on earth are these? 
902,LIZ: Those are bits of what the Brigadier thought might be a meteorite.
903,
904,DOCTOR: Plastic? 
905,LIZ: It's not thermo-plastic and neither is it thermo-setting. And
906,there are no polymer chains. 
907,DOCTOR: That's interesting. I wonder what was inside. 
908,LIZ: Inside? 
909,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, you can tell from the shape this was a hollow"
910,sphere. I should think the space inside was about three thousand cubic
911,"centimetres, wouldn't you? "
912,"BRIGADIER: Do I gather you're going to help us, Doctor? "
913,"DOCTOR: If I do, will you give me the key to the Tardis? "
914,BRIGADIER: Possibly. 
915,"DOCTOR: Then go away and let Miss Shaw and I get on with our work,"
916,"there's a good fellow. Look, do I really have to call you Miss Shaw? "
917,"LIZ: No, Liz, just Liz. "
918,DOCTOR: Liz. That's much better. How many of these things actually came
919,down? 
920,"BRIGADIER: About fifty, as near as we can estimate. "
921,"DOCTOR: And you found only fragments, no whole ones? "
922,"BRIGADIER: One, yes. But there was an accident. It disappeared. "
923,"DOCTOR: Then the answer to your question's obvious, isn't it? By the"
924,"time your search party arrived, the rest of these things had been"
925,"collected. Collected and taken somewhere. The question is, where? "
926,(Ransome is carefully negotiating the barbed wire on top of the back
927,wall of the factory.)

929, [Office]
930,
931, (General Scobie is standing next to a life-sized
932,dummy with his features.) 
933,"HIBBERT: I must explain this is only a rough approximation, General. "
934,"SCOBIE: Yes, it does seem to need a few finishing touches. "
935,"CHANNING: That is why we asked you here, General. Our measuring"
936,techniques are very accurate but the equipment isn't transportable. 
937,"SCOBIE: I see. Well, I hope it turns out all right. "
938,"CHANNING: It will, I assure you, General. If you'll come this way. "
939,"(Ransome pries open a back door to the factory, picks up a large"
940,crowbar and heads up a metal staircase. It brings him out at a door
941,between his old workshop and Hibbert's office. He starts crowbarring
942,the workshop door.)

946," (Ransome enters, puts the crowbar down and gazes"
947,at the strange equipment in his old room. As he goes over to the tank
948,"in the middle, one of the mannequins walks up behind him. Ransome"
949,"turns, his eyes popping out of his head.) "

955,reveal a weapon. Ransome dodges behind the tank then runs for the exit.
956,"The mannequin fires but misses, then chases Ransome out of the"
957,building. Ransome runs down the fire escape and hides in a small
958,"lean-to as Scobie, Hibbert and Channing walk past.) "
959, [Factory yard] 
960, SCOBIE: It seems awfully deserted. 
961,"HIBBERT: We're turning over to automation, General. It means we can"
962,keep staff down to a minimum. 
963,"SCOBIE: Splendid. Don't get machines going on strike, eh? "
964,"(Channing lags behind, and looks up at the mannequin at the top of the"
965,fire escape. It drops its gun arm and head and backs into the building.

971,"SCOBIE: Well, goodbye, Mister Channing. I hope the replica turns out"
972,well. It's been a most interesting afternoon. 
973,"CHANNING: Goodbye, sir. "
974,"HIBBERT: It was very good of you to come down here, General. I know how"
975,busy you must be. 
976,"SCOBIE: My pleasure, gentlemen. Oh, by the way, any chance of seeing"
977,"the model you're making of me, before it's sent to Madame Tussauds? "
978,"CHANNING: Yes, we'll arrange that. "
979,"(Ransome climbs over the factory wall and runs away, terrified.)"
980,
981, [Control room]
982,
983, HIBBERT: How did you know it was Ransome? 
984,CHANNING: I saw him. And he was detected. That is his brain print. 
985,HIBBERT: What will you do? 
986,CHANNING: Send an Auton. 
987,HIBBERT: But it will kill him! 
988,"CHANNING: It is necessary, Hibbert. He saw the security area and all"
989,this. Think! Think. Then you see that it is necessary. 
990,"HIBBERT: Yes, necessary. How will it find him? "
991,(Channing looks at a mannequin and it walks towards him.)

1003,MEG: Just seen more of them soldiers coming through the village. 
1004,"SEELEY: Still looking for them thunderbolts, I bet. "
1005,MEG: They're saying they found one. That's how that poor fellow got
1006,killed. 
1007,SEELEY: Killed? Who got killed? 
1008,MEG: The soldier who was driving. They reckon his neck was broke clean
1009,through. 
1010,SEELEY: Accident or something? 
1011,MEG: According to the army. 
1012,SEELEY: Well then. 
1013,"MEG: Well, drove right off the road, he did. Something must've made him"
1014,do that. 
1015,"SEELEY: I've never known a woman as fanciful as you, Meg. "
1016,"MEG: Then why are the soldiers still here, then? Constable Wilkes said"
1017,that poor boy's face was terrible to look at. Something must have
1018,frightened him dreadful afore he died.

1023,get Ransome to drink some tea.) 
1024,"MUNRO: Come on, come on. Try and drink some. "
1025,(Ransome doesn't swallow.) 
1026,"RANSOME: No eyes, no hair, just stares. "
1027,MUNRO: What? 
1028,RANSOME: Men. Creatures! Made in the factory!

1031, [UNIT laboratory]
1032,
1033, (The test equipment is getting more
1034,sophisticated.) 
1035,LIZ: Are you getting a reading? 
1036,DOCTOR: No. 
1037,"LIZ: Well, that's it. I can't think of anything else we can try. "
1038,"DOCTOR: Well, don't worry, m'dear. We've done our best. "
1039,LIZ: I can't understand it. We've tried a dozen different methods of
1040,analysis and haven't identified a single element. 
1041,"DOCTOR: Yes, what results can you expect with this primitive equipment?"
1042,
1043,"LIZ: Primitive? We've got lasers, spectrographs, micron probes. "
1044,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, yes, I know all that. But what we really need is"
1045,a lateral molecular rectifier. 
1046,LIZ: What on Earth's that? 
1047,"DOCTOR: Not on Earth, unfortunately. But I think I have one in the"
1048,Tardis. 
1049,LIZ: In there? 
1050,DOCTOR: Yes. I'm sure I have one somewhere. But I'm sure I used one
1051,"some time in the past, or was it the future? "
1052,"LIZ: Doctor, you really do have scientific equipment in there? "
1053,"DOCTOR: My dear Liz, I have an entire laboratory. "
1054,"LIZ: Yes, yes, I'm sure you have. "
1055,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, it's true. Well, you think that the Tardis isn't"
1056,"big enough, don't you? That's because you keep looking at it simply as"
1057,a police box. 
1058,"LIZ: Well, it is only a police box. "
1059,"DOCTOR: Oh no, not once you get inside it, it isn't. You see, Liz, the"
1060,Tardis is dimensionally transcendental. 
1061,LIZ: Oh. I see. 
1062,"DOCTOR: Yes, it would take far too long to try and explain that to you."
1063,The important thing is that we've got to get this material analysed. 
1064,LIZ: And you could do that with your equipment? 
1065,DOCTOR: Child's play. The only trouble is Lethbridge-Stewart has taken
1066,away the key and I can't get inside. 
1067,"LIZ: Well, I suppose it is your property. "
1068,"DOCTOR: Yes. Of course, there is always the possibility that you might"
1069,be able to persuade him to part with it.

1073, (Munro is reporting in on the field telephone.) 
1074,"MUNRO: We've drawn a very tight cordon round the area, sir, so if"
1075,"anybody has taken it, they're not going to get far. Right, sir, I will."
1076,
1077,"SEELEY: Here, what are you doing? "
1078,"SERGEANT: Civilian here, sir. Wants to know how much reward for finding"
1079,a thunderball. 
1080,MUNRO: What's your name? 
1081,"SEELEY: Seeley, sir. Sam Seeley. "
1082,"MUNRO: And where do you live, Mister Seeley? "
1083,"SEELEY: Local, sir. Brook cottage. "
1084,"MUNRO: All right. So, you've got something to tell us about these"
1085,meteorites? 
1086,"SEELEY: Me, sir? "
1087,MUNRO: You asked if there was a reward for finding one. 
1088,"SEELEY: Ah, that's right. "
1089,MUNRO: So you know where to find one? 
1090,"SEELEY: I never said that, sir. "
1091,MUNRO: Then why are you interested in a reward? 
1092,"SEELEY: Well, well, in case I might happen come across one like. "
1093,MUNRO: Where you out the day those meteorites landed? 
1094,SEELEY: Meteorites? Don't know about that. Thunderballs I calls them. 
1095,MUNRO: So you were out? 
1096,"SEELEY: I might have been. Then again, I might not. "
1097,"MUNRO: Did you see any of them land? Mister Seeley, I want the truth!"
1098,
1099, [Control room]
1100,
1101, CHANNING: The Autons have lost Ransome. He is
1102,beyond their range. 
1103,HIBBERT: Suppose he goes to UNIT? 
1104,CHANNING: Do you think they will believe him? 
1105,HIBBERT: They might come here. 
1106,CHANNING: Then you will deal with them. Soon it will be the final phase
1107,of the plan. 
1108,HIBBERT: But there's still one energy unit missing. 
1109,CHANNING: The swarm leader. We will find it. 
1110,HIBBERT: What about Ransome? Is he safe now? 
1111,"CHANNING: Unless he returns to the area. If he does, the Autons will"
1112,track him down and destroy him.
1113,
1114, [Brigadier's office]
1115,
1116," RANSOME: The face was smooth, shiny. It was"
1117,plastic! Made in the factory. 
1118,BRIGADIER: Why do you say that? 
1119,"RANSOME: Well, just before this thing came after me, I passed a whole"
1120,line of them. They were all exactly the same. 
1121,"BRIGADIER: It's quite a story, Mister Ransome. "
1122,(Liz knocks and enters.) 
1123,BRIGADIER: Yes? 
1124,"LIZ: Can I have a word with you, Brigadier? "
1125,"BRIGADIER: Not now, I'm busy. "
1126,"LIZ: This is rather important. You see, the Doctor thinks "
1127,"BRIGADIER: Miss Shaw, your work in this laboratory is part of one big"
1128,"exercise. You'll have to be patient. You say this, er, creature was"
1129,armed? 
1130,RANSOME: It took off its hand. 
1131,(Liz sees the Tardis key on the Brigadier's desk.) 
1132,"RANSOME: And there was a sort of tube, and the whole of the arm"
1133,"appeared to be hollow. Well, you should see the hole it blasted in the"
1134,wall! 
1135,"(Behind the Brigadier's back, Liz takes the key and leaves.) "
1136,BRIGADIER: Then there was an explosion? 
1137,"RANSOME: Yes, I suppose so. Not loud, but it was more like a sort of"
1138,whoosh that a rocket makes. 
1139,BRIGADIER: And this didn't attract anybody's attention? 
1140,"RANSOME: Well, I didn't see a living soul in that part of the factory."
1141,They seem to have sacked all the workers. It's completely automated
1142,now. 
1143,"BRIGADIER: How long have you been away in America, Mister Ransome? "
1144,"RANSOME: Er, six months. "
1145,BRIGADIER: None of this was in evidence before you left? New production
1146,"lines, changing over to automation, not steps that occur overnight, are"
1147,they? 
1148,"RANSOME: I agree with you, sir, but it's happened! "
1149,BRIGADIER: The key.

1153, (Liz give the key to the Doctor.) 
1154,DOCTOR: I'm afraid he's going to be awfully cross with you. 
1155,"LIZ: Well, if you're quick, he mightn't even miss it. "
1156,(The Doctor opens the Tardis door.) 
1157,LIZ: It didn't turn when the Brigadier tried to open it. 
1158,"DOCTOR: Well, that's because the lock has a metabolism detector. "
1159,(The Doctor enters the Tardis. The Brigadier enters the lab.) 
1160,"BRIGADIER: Miss Shaw, where's that key? You've given it to him. "
1161,LIZ: He needed some equipment. 
1162,BRIGADIER: Equipment? I had no idea you could be so gullible. That's an
1163,excuse. We shan't see him again. 
1164,"LIZ: Oh, what do you mean? "
1165,BRIGADIER: Listen. 
1166,"(The Tardis dematerialisation sequence starts, but it is stuttering.) "
1167,BRIGADIER: He's going. 
1168,"(There is the sound of a small explosion inside the Tardis, some smoke"
1169,"comes out and the noise grinds to a halt. The Doctor emerges,"
1170,coughing.) 
1171,DOCTOR: Just testing. I wanted to see if the controls 
1172,"LIZ: Doctor, you tricked me. "
1173,"DOCTOR: Yes. The temptation was too strong, my dear. It's just that I"
1174,couldn't bear the thought of being tied to one planet and one time. I'm
1175,sorry. It won't happen again. 
1176,"BRIGADIER: It won't? Give me the key, Doctor. "
1177,"DOCTOR: Must I? The Tardis no longer works, as you saw. "
1178,"BRIGADIER: Well, will you give me your word not to try to escape again?"
1179,
1180,DOCTOR: I couldn't escape now if I wanted to. They've trapped me here! 
1181,LIZ: Who have? 
1182,"DOCTOR: That mean, despicable, underhanded lot! They've changed the"
1183,dematerialisation code. 
1184,BRIGADIER: The what? 
1185,"DOCTOR: The dematerial. It doesn't matter, you wouldn't understand"
1186,anyway. 
1187,BRIGADIER: There's a great deal that I don't understand. But one thing
1188,"I did understand, Doctor, was that you promised your help. "
1189,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I've tried to help you the best way I can, but I"
1190,need more evidence. I need more to go on. 
1191,"BRIGADIER: Well, I think I may be able to help you."

1197,
1198, [Brigadier's office]
1199,
1200, BRIGADIER: What made you go back to the factory? 
1201,RANSOME: I wanted to try to talk to George on his own. And I wanted to
1202,get a look at that security area. 
1203,BRIGADIER: Do you think he's afraid of something? 
1204,"RANSOME: I don't know, but this other man who came in "
1205,BRIGADIER: Did you find out who the other man was? 
1206,"RANSOME: Yes, his name's Channing. Now, he seemed to have some sort of"
1207,"mental hold over George, almost as if he was hypnotised. "
1208,"DOCTOR: You know, Brigadier, I think perhaps a visit to that plastics"
1209,"factory would be in order, don't you?"

1216,"are. Now, about the meteorites? "
1217,"SEELEY: Look, sir, it's a mistake. I haven't seen nothing. "
1218,"MUNRO: If you tell us where it is, you can go home. "
1219,"SEELEY: Worth a bit of money, I reckon. "
1220,MUNRO: So you do know where there is one? 
1221,SEELEY: I might. 
1222,"MUNRO: Seeley, I'm not going to bargain with you. You tell me"
1223,"everything you know, and tell me quick. "

1232,(An Auton in the bracket turns and moves.) 
1233,HIBBERT: Suppose it stops signalling again? 
1234,"CHANNING: We're nearly there. Through the trees, across the road. The"

1336,hospital though. 
1337,BRIGADIER: Right. I'll lay on an ambulance. 
1338,(The Brigadier leaves.) 
1339,"DOCTOR: You know, this really is most interesting. We must examine it"
1340,in the laboratory. 
1341,LIZ: What do you make of it? 
1342,"DOCTOR: Well, I was right about the shape, wasn't I? The signal must"
1343,have been muffled by the metal of that trunk. It's most interesting. 
1344,LIZ: Suppose it explodes like the other one? 
1345,DOCTOR: There's no reason why it should as long as we treat it gently.
1346,"Unless, of course "
1347,LIZ: Unless what? 
1348,"DOCTOR: It has a built-in destruct impulse. In that case, we'll just"
1349,have to risk it. 
1350,"LIZ: Doctor, suppose that thing comes back for it? "
1351,(That thing is currently cutting its way through the canvas at the
1352,field HQ. The Auton enters and points its weapon at Ransome.)
1353,
1354, [Control room]
1355,
1356, CHANNING: Destroy! Total destruction! 
1357,(The Auton fires. Ransome is blasted backwards off the bench he was
1358,lying on. Then his body explodes in a cloud of red gas which expands
1359,"then contracts back on itself, leaving nothing behind. The Auton"
1360,leaves.)
1361,
1362, [Outside Seeley's cottage]
1363,
1364," MUNRO: The creature got away into the woods, sir. "
1365,"BRIGADIER: Munro, I want a cordon round that plastics factory. "
1366,"MUNRO: Very good, sir. "
1367,"BRIGADIER: That creature, robot, or whatever it was, obviously came"
1368,from there. Mister Ransome described something very like it. 
1369,"DOCTOR: Yes, and until we know a bit more about these things, I think"
1370,we should move very cautiously.
1371,
1372, [UNIT field HQ]
1373,
1374," SERGEANT: But he couldn't just have walked out,"
1375,sir. I've had a guard on the front of the tent all the time. 
1376,"BRIGADIER: Never mind about the front, what about the back? That's how"
1377,he got away. 
1378,MUNRO: He must have cut his way out. 
1379,"DOCTOR: No, he didn't cut his way out, but somebody cut their way in."
1380,This canvas has been ripped from the outside. 
1381,BRIGADIER: So they took him from under our very noses. 
1382,"DOCTOR: If Mister Ransome is anywhere, he'll be at that plastics"
1383,factory. So I suggest that we go there immediately.
1384,
1385, [Office]
1386,
1387," (The Brigadier, Liz and the Doctor are escorted"
1388,through the empty factory by the silent woman. While they wait outside
1389,Hibbert's office the Brigadier turns to see Channing staring at him
1390,through the shaped glass of another office door. The multiple eyes
1391,"effect is slightly unnerving. A little later, inside.) "
1392,HIBBERT: What an extraordinary story! What made him say such a thing? 
1393,"BRIGADIER: We have to check on it, Mister Hibbert, however"
1394,extraordinary it may be. 
1395,HIBBERT: I'd like to hear him tell this story in front of me. 
1396,"LIZ: He was coming with us but, unfortunately, he disappeared. "
1397,"HIBBERT: Ah, he was a brilliant young man in many ways. "
1398,LIZ: Then why did you dismiss him? 
1399,"HIBBERT: Oh, he had some wild scheme for making electronic dolls. The"
1400,design was quite impractical. He was very unpleasant when I turned him
1401,down. 
1402,BRIGADIER: So you feel he told this story just to cause you trouble? 
1403,HIBBERT: I'm afraid so. It must have been praying on his mind. 
1404,DOCTOR: What exactly are you making here? 
1405,"HIBBERT: Er, plastic dolls of course, but our new line is display"
1406,mannequins for shops. We send them all over the country. 
1407,DOCTOR: And can these mannequins actually move? 
1408,"HIBBERT: Well, they're flexible, of course. That's why we've captured"
1409,"the market. But I can assure you, they can't move on their own. "
1410,BRIGADIER: So Ransome may have been simply making trouble? 
1411,HIBBERT: I can't think of another explanation. 
1412,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I've think we've seen all we can possibly see here."
1413,I'm sorry if we've been a nuisance. 
1414,HIBBERT: Not at all. I'll see you out.
1415,
1416, [UNIT laboratory]
1417,
1418, BRIGADIER: It was the man who led the raid on the
1419,hospital. I recognised him from his photograph. 
1420,LIZ: And what will you do now? 
1421,(The Doctor has the globe hooked up to what looks like an EEG machine.)
1422,
1423,BRIGADIER: I've put a call through to General Scobie. If I can get his
1424,"authority, I'll surround the place and raid it. "
1425,"DOCTOR: Here, come over here, you two. Look at this. "
1426,LIZ: Have you got something? 
1427,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1428,BRIGADIER: What does that thing do? 
1429,"DOCTOR: It measures mental activity. It's fascinating, isn't it? "
1430,LIZ: You mean there's some form of intelligence inside that globe? 
1431,"DOCTOR: Yes. You know, it's as I suspected. This globe is only a"
1432,container. I wonder whether we can communicate with it? 
1433,(The intercom buzzes.) 
1434,BRIGADIER: Yes? 
1435,"MUNRO : Your call to General Scobie, sir. "
1436,BRIGADIER: Good.
1437,
1438, [Scobie's house]
1439,
1440," SCOBIE: What's that, Stewart? Auto Plastics? Yes,"
1441,I was there about two hours. Why?
1442,
1443, [UNIT laboratory]
1444,
1445, BRIGADIER: I wondered if you'd noticed anything
1446,"irregular, sir? We've had some rather strange reports about that"
1447,factory.
1448,
1449, [Scobie's house]
1450,
1451," SCOBIE: Nothing at all. No, perfectly normal. Yes,"
1452,"pleasant couple of fellows, I thought. Right. I see. Well, that sounds"
1453,"pretty serious. Yes, I'll come and see you straight away. I'll give you"
1454,all the support you need. 
1455,(There is a knock at the door.) 
1456,"SCOBIE: Well, goodbye, Stewart. "
1457,(Scobie opens the front door to - himself! His shiny-faced duplicate
1458,enters and advances as Scobie backs away.)

1462, [UNIT laboratory]
1463,
1464," BRIGADIER: What are you actually trying to do,"
1465,Doctor? 
1466,"DOCTOR: Well, it appears that in there we have what one might loosely"
1467,"call a brain. Fifty megacycles, Liz. If we can establish the frequency"
1468,on which it operates 
1469,"(Bang, flash.) "
1470,"DOCTOR: Oh, dear. "
1471,"LIZ: We overloaded the circuit, I think. "
1472,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, you were saying that this is some kind of brain. "
1473,"DOCTOR: Yeah, or part of a brain. An intelligence. Yes, that's probably"
1474,nearer the mark. 
1475,BRIGADIER: Sending signals somewhere. Where to? 
1476,"DOCTOR: Well, the rest of itself, surely? "
1477,LIZ: The other globes that came down? 
1478,DOCTOR: Mmm hmm. 
1479,LIZ: They're all part of one entity. Let's say a collective
1480,intelligence. 
1481,BRIGADIER: Can it see us? 
1482,"DOCTOR: My dear fellow, it's not sentient. "
1483,"LIZ: No, our measurements prove there's no physical substance inside"
1484,it. 
1485,"BRIGADIER: But, if it is has no physical form "
1486,"DOCTOR: No, once here it can presumably create a suitable shell for"
1487,itself. Otherwise there'd be no point in coming. 
1488,LIZ: The plastics factory. 
1489,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1490,(The intercom buzzes.) 
1491,BRIGADIER: Yes? 
1492,"MUNRO : General Scobie calling, sir. "
1493,"BRIGADIER: Put him on. As soon as I get his authority, we'll move in."
1494,
1495, [Office]
1496,
1497, SCOBIE 2: Stewart? About that Auto Plastic
1498,"factory. Yes, but it's off limits, I'm afraid. They've got some"
1499,important work on hand. It mustn't be interfered with.
1500,
1501, [UNIT laboratory]
1502,
1503," BRIGADIER: Sir, if you'll just. Oh, he's hung up. "
1504,LIZ: What are you going to do now? 
1505,"BRIGADIER: There's not much I can do, except go over his head. Yes,"
1506,I'll get on to the Home Secretary and if I don't get him to revoke that
1507,"order, I'll go to UNIT headquarters in Geneva. "
1508,DOCTOR: That's going to take time. 
1509,BRIGADIER: The old fool. Just because he feels flattered they made a
1510,facsimile of him. 
1511,DOCTOR: Facsimile? Of General Scobie? 
1512,"BRIGADIER: A plastic replica, yes. Apparently, they make these things"
1513,for Madame Tussauds. It's one of their sidelines. 
1514,DOCTOR: Oh my goodness. The waxworks.
1515,
1516, [Madame Tussauds display room]
1517,
1518, (We are treated to the display of famous US
1519,"Presidents - Kennedy, Nixon, Washington, Lincoln and a few others I'm"
1520,not sure of. Eisenhower probably. The Doctor and Liz are with other
1521,visitors.) 
1522,"DOCTOR: Well, I think this is the right room. Liz? "
1523,LIZ: What? 
1524,DOCTOR: Do you recognise any of these people? 
1525,"LIZ: Yes, of course. I think all that group are top civil servants."
1526,"Hey, that's odd. They're all Government types. There are no astronauts,"
1527,"famous personalities. You know, people like that. "
1528,"DOCTOR: Yes. Oh, excuse me? "
1529,"ATTENDANT: Yes, sir? "
1530,DOCTOR: I understand these figures aren't made of wax. Is that right? 
1531,"ATTENDANT: Yes, that's right, sir. These are plastic. It's an entirely"
1532,new process. 
1533,DOCTOR: Are they supplying any more or is the tableau complete now? 
1534,"ATTENDANT: Oh, they're coming in with them all the time, sir. They"
1535,brought that fellow in just this morning. 
1536,LIZ: General Scobie! 
1537,DOCTOR: Well that was quick. When did he visit the factory? 
1538,LIZ: Yesterday afternoon. 
1539,(The Doctor makes a close examination of the figure.) 
1540,"LIZ: What are you doing, Doctor? Doctor, what are you doing? "
1541,"DOCTOR: Shush. Liz, if you were making a model of someone, would you"
1542,put a wristwatch on it. 
1543,"LIZ: I might do, if it had to look really authentic. "
1544,DOCTOR: Yes. Would you go to the trouble of winding it up and keeping
1545,it at the correct time? I think you and I had better have a word with
1546,Lethbridge-Stewart.
1547,
1548, [Brigadier's office]

1554,
1555, (The Doctor is using a pay phone.) 
1556,"DOCTOR: Well, when he comes in, tell him that I'll call again later,"
1557,will you? Goodbye. 
1558,LIZ: Now what will we do? 
1559,"DOCTOR: Well, there's only one thing we can do. Wait. "
1560,LIZ: Wait for what? 
1561,DOCTOR: Closing time.
1562,
1563, [Control room]
1564,
1565, HIBBERT: What will it look like when it's ready? 
1566,"CHANNING: I cannot tell you, yet. "
1567,HIBBERT: But you must know what it looks like. You made it. 
1568,CHANNING: I made nothing. I merely provided an environment tank in
1569,which the energy units can create the perfect life form. 
1570,HIBBERT: I don't understand. 
1571,CHANNING: Of course you don't. How can you? 
1572,HIBBERT: You talk as though you were not 
1573,"CHANNING: Don't struggle against me, Hibbert. Trust me. We must work"
1574,together. 
1575,"HIBBERT: Yes, of course. "
1576,CHANNING: Good. The swarm leader has to be brought here. 
1577,HIBBERT: But UNIT have taken it. How can we? 
1578,CHANNING: You forget we have General Scobie. 
1579,"HIBBERT: He's just a copy, Channing. If he's detected "
1580,CHANNING: You have only seen the Autons. Crude weapons with a single
1581,offensive function. The facsimiles like Scobie's are perfect
1582,"reproductions, even down to brain cells and memory traces. We shall"
1583,activate them all tonight. You will see then how effective they are.
1584,
1585, [UNIT laboratory]
1586,
1587, SCOBIE 2: Odd looking object. 
1588,"MUNRO: May I ask, sir, what you intend doing with it? "
1589,SCOBIE 2: The government is sending it to the Royal Geophysical
1590,Laboratory. 
1591,"MUNRO: With respect, sir, I think the Brigadier ought to be informed"
1592,first. I have no authority to part with it. 
1593,SCOBIE 2: You can tell Brigadier Stewart I ordered you to hand it over.
1594,
1595,"MUNRO: My orders must come through UNIT, sir. "
1596,"SCOBIE: Captain Munro, you may be attached to UNIT but you're still in"
1597,the army. Will you give me the globe? Or shall I take it and arrest you
1598,for mutiny? 
1599,"MUNRO: You leave me no alternative, sir."

1604,leaves. The Doctor and Liz sneak out from behind a curtain near Gandhi
1605,and the British political figures.) 
1606,LIZ: I don't like this. 
1607,"DOCTOR: Oh, there's nothing to be afraid of. They're only dummies. I"
1608,"think. It's funny how their eyes seem to follow you, isn't it? "
1609,LIZ: Hilarious. 
1610,(The Doctor moves away from Liz.) 
1611,LIZ: Doctor? Doctor? Doctor? 
1612,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
1613,LIZ: Oh! I thought I heard something. 
1614,"DOCTOR: No, it's only your imagination. "
1615,LIZ: Are they plastic? 
1616,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I'm sure they are. LIZ: But when you talked about the"
1617,"watch, you meant that this is the real General Scobie. "
1618,"DOCTOR: Yes, and his plastic facsimile is walking around somewhere. Now"
1619,just 
1620,LIZ: Someone's coming. 
1621,DOCTOR: Quick! Back behind the curtain. 
1622,(The Doctor and Liz hide. Channing and Hibbert enter.) 
1623,HIBBERT: What's wrong? 
1624,CHANNING: There is an alien life form somewhere near. I can sense it. 
1625,"HIBBERT: There's only you and me here, and the facsimiles, and Scobie. "
1626,CHANNING: Scobie. Yes. Open the door. 
1627,HIBBERT: What do you have to do to activate them? 
1628,CHANNING: Nothing. They know it is time. 
1629,(The anonymous civil servants and military walk out of the room.) 
1630,HIBBERT: Where are they going? 
1631,CHANNING: To take their places. It is time for them to begin work. 
1632,(Channing and Hibbert follow the facsimiles out and close the door. The
1633,Doctor and Liz come out of hiding. Only Scobie is left of the entire
1634,tableau.) 
1635,HIBBERT: What are you doing here? You shouldn't 
1636,DOCTOR: Shush. 
1637,HIBBERT: Channing will 
1638,"DOCTOR: Shush, shush, shush! If you tell Channing that we're here, the"
1639,"Autons will kill us, as I think they killed your friend Ransome. "
1640,"HIBBERT: Ransome? I had to dismiss him, because Channing said "
1641,DOCTOR: Channing is controlling your mind. You must resist him.
1642,Channing is your enemy. The enemy of the entire human race! 
1643,HIBBERT: Channing is my partner. New policy 
1644,"DOCTOR: Now listen to me, Hibbert. You've got to get away from"
1645,"Channing. Get away and think. Now, come to UNIT. I can help you. "
1646,CHANNING : Hibbert! 
1647,(The Doctor and Liz freeze against a curtain as Channing enters.) 
1648,CHANNING: What are you doing? 
1649,HIBBERT: I was just checking. 
1650,CHANNING: There is nothing to check. We are finished here. 
1651, [Brigadier's office] 
1652," DOCTOR: It's the facsimiles, Brigadier. They're"
1653,moving. They've just left the waxworks. 
1654,"LIZ: You've got to act quickly, Brigadier, or else it'll be too late."
1655,By tomorrow 
1656,"DOCTOR: By tomorrow, they will have taken over the key positions in the"
1657,entire country. Now you've got to move against that factory now!
1658,

1660, (The globe is delivered.) 
1661,"SCOBIE 2: If they move against you, I shall be ready for them. "
1662,CHANNING: Humans are not predictable. It is growing difficult to
1663,maintain control over Hibbert. 
1664,SCOBIE 2: Hibbert is no longer necessary. 
1665,CHANNING: No. We need no one now. 
1666,(Channing takes the globe and goes to a piece of equipment with a steel
1667,"duct. He reverently places the globe under the opening. In the tank,"
1668,the creature starts pulsing. Channing adjusts a few controls and the
1669,whole place pulses in time with the globe until all its energy has been
1670,transferred. The neuron in the tank swings back and forth.) 
1671,"CHANNING: At dawn, we will activate the Autons. "

1679,keep me eyes open. 
1680,"DOCTOR: And a red. Here it is. Hold onto those for a moment, will you? "
1681,(Liz takes a bunch of wires from the Doctor.)

1703,"DOCTOR: Well, of course it's going to work. "
1704,BRIGADIER: What will work? 
1705,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm trying to devise a weapon that we can use against"
1706,"them. Well, it's not very efficient, I know, but it's the best that I"
1707,can do. And then you've got to take me to the security area of that
1708,factory. 
1709,"BRIGADIER: Well, how can I? I can't even contact my support platoons. "
1710,"DOCTOR: Well, how many men can you raise? "

1727,been happening. I know what I've done. You've been controlling my mind!
1728,The Doctor was right! 
1729,CHANNING: You have spoken to him? 
1730,HIBBERT: Who are you? What are you? 
1731,CHANNING: We are the Nestenes. 
1732,HIBBERT: Nestenes? 
1733,CHANNING: We have been colonising other planets for a thousand million
1734,years. Now we have come to colonise Earth. 
1735,HIBBERT: Colonise it? Then what is going to happen to man? You'll
1736,destroy us.

1764,
1765, (Halfway up the fire escape.) 
1766,LIZ: Someone sent our support troops after all. 
1767,(It is Scobie 2 with a squad of regular army.) 
1768,SCOBIE 2: Brigadier Stewart!
1769,
1770, [Control room]
1771,
1772, SCOBIE 2 : You and your men are under
1773,arrest!
1774,
1775, [Factory yard]
1776,
1777," BRIGADIER: This isn't General Scobie! Now, listen"
1778,to me. 
1779,"SCOBIE 2: Order your men to lay down their arms, Brigadier, or they"
1780,will be made
1781,
1782, [Control room]
1783,
1784, SCOBIE 2 : To do so.
1785,
1786, [Factory yard]
1787,
1788, DOCTOR: Perhaps I can settle this argument? I
1789,"mean, as to whether this really is General Scobie. "
1790,"(The Doctor plugs one end of a cable into his contraption, which Liz is"
1791,"carrying, and walks down the fire escape holding the other end, which"
1792,is a small reflecting dish with an antenna.) 
1793,"DOCTOR: General Scobie, would you be kind enough to say a few words"
1794,into the microphone? 
1795,SCOBIE 2: What sort of foolery is this? 
1796,"DOCTOR: Switch on, Liz! "
1797,(Scobie 2 collapses with a cry.) 
1798,MUNRO: You've killed him! 
1799,"DOCTOR: I don't think so. You see, he was never really alive. "
1800,(The Doctor rolls Scobie 2's body over to reveal that the face is now a
1801,"blank. In Tussauds, the real man comes back to consciousness and sways,"
1802,startling the visitors.) 
1803,BRIGADIER: It may be difficult to grasp but that's the situation we've
1804,"got to deal with. You will place your men under my orders, is that"
1805,clear? 
1806,"ARMY: Very good, sir. "
1807,(The Doctor and Liz walk away.) 
1808,"LIZ: Doctor, where are we going? "
1809,"DOCTOR: If we're quick, my dear, we can save everybody a lot of"
1810,trouble. 
1811,[Factory]
1812,
1813,(The Doctor and Liz hide as a patrolling Auton
1814,approaches. As it draws near - ) 
1815,DOCTOR: Now! 
1816,(The Auton collapses.) 
1817,"DOCTOR: Well, there we are, my dear Liz. Who said we got the wrong"
1818,frequency?
1819,
1820, [Factory yard]
1821,
1822, (Five Autons come out of the factory.) 
1823,BRIGADIER: Take cover! Fire! 
1824,"(A pointless gun battle starts, with the army having no effect on the"
1825,Autons.) 
1826,BRIGADIER: Fall back! 
1827,(A soldier is killed.)
1828,
1829, [Control room]
1830,
1831, (Liz crouches out of sight by the door as the
1832,Doctor strolls over to Channing.) 
1833,CHANNING: You're too late. 
1834,"DOCTOR: On this planet, there is a saying that it is never too late."
1835,Good gracious! What on earth is this thing? 
1836,CHANNING: A lifeform perfectly adapted for survival and conquest on
1837,this planet. 
1838,DOCTOR: Is that what you look like on your own planet? 
1839,CHANNING: No. We have no individual identity. 
1840,"DOCTOR: So this thing is a sort of collective brain, nervous system? "
1841,"CHANNING: Humanly speaking, yes. "
1842,"DOCTOR: Oh, but I'm not human. So, if you live as a group, you can be"
1843,"destroyed as a group, surely? "
1844,CHANNING: You cannot destroy us. 
1845,"DOCTOR: I destroyed your facsimile of Scobie, therefore I can destroy"
1846,all of you. 
1847,"CHANNING: No one has the power to destroy us, not even you. We are"
1848,indestructible. 
1849,(The army continues to lose the battle. One soldier foolishly takes
1850,"cover behind a tank of transformer oil, clearly labelled Danger. Boom!)"
1851,
1852,"DOCTOR: So you see, Mister Channing, with this device I can eliminate"
1853,you. 
1854,CHANNING: No one can destroy the Nestenes! 
1855,(Channing turns a dial on the tank to maximum and runs away. The lid of
1856,the tank lifts and steam pours out.) 
1857,"DOCTOR: Oh no! Switch on, Liz! Liz, switch on! "
1858,LIZ: I have! 
1859,DOCTOR: It's not working! 
1860,(The Doctor starts fiddling with the tank controls.) 
1861,"DOCTOR: Liz, come on. Liz, come on, quick! Well, what's wrong with it? "
1862,"LIZ: Doctor, I'm trying. "
1863,"(While Liz checks all the connections, a green octopus-like tentacle"
1864,comes out of the tank and wraps itself around the Doctor's neck. Liz
1865,looks round the corner to see him struggling with it as another
1866,tentacle wraps around a leg. Five of them are coming out of the tank
1867,"now. As the Doctor's eyes start to pop out of his head, she plugs the"
1868,cable back in and tries again.) 
1869,LIZ: Now! 
1870,(The Doctor manages to keep his end of the device vaguely pointing
1871,towards the tank. A few seconds later the neuron explodes and outside
1872,the Autons collapse. The tentacles writhe in their death throes then
1873,lie still. The Doctor untangles himself.) 
1874,"DOCTOR: You can switch off, I think, now, Liz. "
1875,LIZ: Channing. 
1876,(Channing is just another Auton now.)
1877,
1878, [UNIT laboratory]
1879,
1880," LIZ: Basically, it's the same as an ECT machine."
1881,Electric convulsion therapy. 
1882,"DOCTOR: Only much more powerful, of course. "
1883,"BRIGADIER: Well, it worked. Doctor? These Nestenes, will they try"
1884,again? 
1885,"DOCTOR: Possibly. They're telepathic, so they certainly know what"
1886,happened. 
1887,"BRIGADIER: If they do decide to launch a second attack, I hope we can"
1888,count on your help again? 
1889,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, before we go into all that, Brigadier, I think we"
1890,must discuss terms. 
1891,BRIGADIER: Terms? 
1892,"DOCTOR: Yes. After all, you do want to take advantage of my services"
1893,"again, don't you? "
1894,BRIGADIER: I think you'll find the salary is quite adequate. 
1895,"DOCTOR: Money? My dear chap, I don't want money. I've got no use for"
1896,the stuff. 
1897,BRIGADIER: Then what do you want? 
1898,"DOCTOR: Well, facilities to repair the Tardis, laboratory, equipment,"
1899,help from Miss Shaw here. 
1900,"BRIGADIER: Very well. Anything you need. Within reason, of course. Is"
1901,that all? 
1902,"DOCTOR: My goodness, no. Don't you realise that when I was stranded on"
1903,"this little planet of yours, I had nothing but these clothes that I Oh,"
1904,my goodness! 
1905,"LIZ: What is it, Doctor? "
1906,"DOCTOR: Well, I've just realised. I don't even own these. I borrowed"
1907,"them from the hospital. And there's that car, too. Yes, you know, I"
1908,took to that car. It had character. 
1909,"BRIGADIER: No, Doctor. That car must be returned to its owner. "
1910,"DOCTOR: Must it? Yes, yes, I suppose it must. Still, there's no reason"
1911,"why you couldn't find me something similar, is there? I mean, it could"
1912,"persuade me to stay, you know. "
1913,"BRIGADIER: Oh, very well. "
1914,DOCTOR: Good. When can we go and choose it? 
1915,BRIGADIER: Not yet. I must arrange for a full set of papers first. By
1916,"the way, I've just realised. I don't even know your name. "
1917,DOCTOR: Smith. Doctor John Smith.
