20,One 
21, [Space Port]
22,
23,(A space ship descends vertically onto a pad. Two
24,"aliens in silver clothes meet on a walkway. They have silver-grey skin,"
25,and hair which runs round the back of the head and almost meets their
26,"bushy eyebrows, leaving the top of the head bald. ) "
27,"KALIK: Well, the cargo shuttle has arrived at last. "
28,ORUM: One must prepare oneself to encounter the aliens. 
29,"KALIK: Reluctantly, one agrees. "
30,"(Down below, boxes are being disgorged from a baggage area and falling"
31,onto the floor. A different type of alien with a very grey skin and no
32,hair at all gestures and drags others of his kind to get the boxes onto
33,a nearby conveyor belt. Then two people in space suits fall out of the
34,"hatch. One is a man with curly hair and spectacles, the other a woman"
35,with bright earrings.) 
36,"VORG: Oh, phew. Oh dear. "
37,"SHIRNA: Top of the bill, he says. Received like Princes, he says. "
38,"VORG: Now, now, Shirna, don't be so. The scope! Come on. Come on, give"
39,me a hand. 
40,(Shirna helps him with a large cylinder with a half-globe on the top.) 
41,VORG: Careful now. Please be careful. 
42,(Two of the baggage handlers push it away from the hatch.) 
43,"VORG: Now have a care with that, please? It cost a lot of credit bars. "
44,(Vorg picks up his single large bag while Shirna collects lots of
45,smaller red and blue ones.) 
46,"SHIRNA: Look out, here they come. "
47,(Kalik and Orum enter. One of the baggage handlers grabs his head and
48,runs out and up to an upper walkway.) 
49,"ORUM: No, no, no. Back! Back! Back! "
50,(Orum holds back the other baggage handlers while Kalik takes an
51,elegant device like a two pronged fork with a bar joining the tips of
52,the
53,"prongs, and a red light bulb in the handle. He fires, and the handler"
54,falls from the walkway to the floor.) 
55,ORUM: Very good. You have eradicated him. 
56,"KALIK: No, no, no. Merely rendered him unconscious. "
57,ORUM: But he will be disposed of? 
58,KALIK: Naturally. But first his mental and nervous systems will be
59,subjected to analysis. 
60,"ORUM: Yes, of course. Now, one must deal with the aliens."
61,
62, [Cargo hold]
63,
64, (The Tardis materialises in the hold of a
65,sea-going vessel which is neither alien nor modern.) 
66,"DOCTOR: Look, I tell you there's no need for a test, Jo. I've been here"
67,before and the air is perfectly 
68,"JO: Poo, it smells. "
69,"DOCTOR: Yeah, that's odd. "
70,JO: Sort of farmy. 
71,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, gaseous sulphides, low concentration. Nothing to"
72,worry about.
73,
74, [Space Port]
75,
76, (Shirna takes off her spacesuit to reveal her
77,showgirl's outfit - a multicoloured low-cut halterneck cat suit with
78,lots of bobbles on it. The baggage handlers gather. Vorg is also
79,brightly dressed. His sequined coat has very large coloured plastic
80,circles on the lapels.) 
81,"SHIRNA: Hey, Vorg. "
82,"VORG: Well, well, well. We're getting a crowd. Better start the pitch. "
83,SHIRNA: Here? 
84,"VORG: There's no point in wasting any time. Roll up, roll up and see"
85,the monster show! 
86,(Vorg puts on a transparent bowler hat. Shirna taps an alien
87,tambourine.) 
88,"VORG: Roll up and see the monster show! A carnival of monsters, all"
89,"living in their natural habitat, wild in this little box of mine. A"
90,miracle of intragalactic technology! Roll up! Roll up! Roll 
91,"(Kalik and Orum enter, and the baggage handlers shuffle away quickly.) "
92,KALIK: So those are Lurmans. 
93,"ORUM: The male is called Vorg, it seems. The female, Shirna. "
94,KALIK: Ridiculous names. At least their physiology is familiar. One was
95,afraid they might have four heads. 
96,ORUM: No doubt that is why President Zarb decreed that Lurmans should
97,be our first alien visitors. 
98,KALIK: No good can come from fraternising with these inferior races. 
99,"ORUM: Nevertheless, Commissioner Kalik, one has one's duty to perform,"
100,no matter how unpleasant. 
101,KALIK: Hmm. One thinks one will wait for Plectrac. He is chairman of
102,this tribunal. Let him do his duty. 
103,(A red light flashes on the Scope.) 
104,"SHIRNA: Vorg, look. "
105,"VORG: Huh? Oh, that's nothing. "
106,(He tries hitting the Scope.) 
107,VORG: I'm sure it's nothing. 
108,"SHIRNA: It indicates a systems defect, doesn't it? "
109,VORG: It's just a loose connection somewhere. Nothing of any
110,importance. 
111,SHIRNA: A systems defect. 
112,VORG: Of all the times to go wrong!
113,
114, [Cargo hold]
115,
116," DOCTOR: Well, I can assure you that the last time"
117,"I was here, the air was like wine. "
118,JO: Are you certain we are here? 
119,DOCTOR: Where? 
120,"JO: Well, where you think we are. Are you sure you can steer that"
121,Tardis properly? 
122,"DOCTOR: Jo, I don't steer the Tardis, I programme it, and according to"
123,"programme, this is Metebelis Three, the famous blue planet of the"
124,Acteon group. 
125,JO: Shush. Listen! 
126,(The ship's engine's are rumbling.) 
127,DOCTOR: That's extraordinary. We appear to be in some kind of a
128,machine. 
129,"JO: Yes, and it's moving. I can feel it. "
130,"DOCTOR: Yes, you're right. Come on. "
131,JO: Where are you going? 
132,"DOCTOR: Well, to find out where we are, of course. "
133,JO: I thought you knew? 
134,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, we may have slightly overshot the blue planet, but"
135,we must be on one of planets in the group. We'll soon see. 
136,(Something else makes a noise in the hold.) 
137,JO: Doctor! 
138,DOCTOR: What is it? 
139,JO: There's something alive over there. 
140,"DOCTOR: Well, let's take a look, shall we? "
141,(They go over to a crate.) 
142,JO: Chickens! 
143,DOCTOR: Greetings! 
144,"DOCTOR: All right, all right, all right, all right. We're friends. "
145,JO: Try clucking. 
146,"DOCTOR: Jo, when you've travelled as much as I have, you'll learn never"
147,"to judge by appearances. These creatures may look like chickens, but"
148,"for all we know, they're the intelligent life form on this planet. "
149,"JO: They not only look like chickens, they are chickens. And what about"
150,this? 
151,(The box underneath the chickens has a place name stenciled across it.)
152,
153,DOCTOR: Singapore. 
154,"JO: The Acteon galaxy, you said, Doctor? "
155,"DOCTOR: Oh, Jo, do come on. "
156,JO: Bye. 
157,(Outside the hold door is a ladder to the main deck.)
158,
159, [Main deck]
160,
161, (A sailor walks past the doors to the lower decks.
162,The Doctor and Jo open one slightly and watch him walk away.) 
163,JO: Hey 
164,DOCTOR: Shush. 
165,JO: It's just an ordinary ship. 
166,"DOCTOR: Appearances can be very deceiving, Jo. There's something wrong"
167,here. 
168,"JO: We're still on Earth, aren't we. "
169,"DOCTOR: No, that's impossible. "
170,JO: Don't you ever admit that you're wrong? 
171,"DOCTOR: No. That's impossible too. Come on, but keep low. "
172,"(They creep past the main cargo hatches, then hide as an Indian cook"
173,pours a bucket of slops over the side.) 
174,DOCTOR: Okay. 
175,(They go up a ladder to the rear superstructure where any passengers
176,and crew would live.) 
177,DALY : Splendid dinner. Absolutely topping. 
178,(The Doctor and Jo duck into an open cabin as a man in a white suit
179,"walks along the gangway with a young woman in 1920s dress, followed by"
180,an officer in tropical whites.) 
181,DALY: There's nothing like a good curry.
182,
183,[Saloon cabin]
184,
185, (The Doctor and Jo hide behind a large settee as
186,the dinner party enter.) 
187,"DALY: You say the cook's a Madrasi, Andrews? "
188,"ANDREWS: I believe so, sir. "
189,(Everyone say Hi to  Ian
190,Marter.) 
191,DALY: Oh. I find the Madrasis a bit idle myself. Won't have them on the
192,"plantation. Still, I must admit your fellow does know how to curry a"
193,chicken. Sundowner? 
194,(Daly pours a drink.) 
195,"ANDREWS: Not for me, sir. "
196,DALY: Claire? 
197,"CLAIRE: No thank you, Daddy. John and I thought we'd take a turn around"
198,the deck. 
199,"ANDREWS: Would you care to join us, sir? It's a glorious evening. "
200,"DALY: No, no, no, no. You two run along. I'm going to do a spot of"
201,reading. Determined to finish this book before we reach Bombay. 
202,"CLAIRE: Well, we're due there tomorrow. How much have you got left? "
203,DALY: Only another two chapters. 
204,"ANDREWS: Well, we'll see you later then, sir. "
205,DALY: Yes. 
206,"ANDREWS: Twenty times round the deck is a mile, Claire. So, if we put"
207,our best feet forward 
208,(Andrews and Claire leave. Daly settles with his book but soon yawns
209,and falls asleep.) 
210,CLAIRE : I love musical plays. I saw Lady Be Good four times. Don't
211,"you think that young American chap was marvellous? You know, Fred"
212,somebody. Fred Astaire. 
213,"ANDREWS : Personally, I think musicals are a lot of nonsense. "
214,(The couple carry on with their next circuit of the deck. There is the
215,faint sound of jazz music from somewhere. The Doctor and Jo come out of
216,hiding.) 
217,"DOCTOR: (sotto) No, there's only one explanation. "
218,JO: (sotto) What's that? 
219,DOCTOR: (sotto) This isn't Earth. It just looks like it. 
220,"JO: (sotto) All right, Doctor, I'll convince you. "
221,DALY: (mumble) chota peg (mumble) 
222,(Jo takes a magazine from the table.) 
223,JO: (sotto) There. Take a look at that. 
224,"(It is The Illustrated London News of Saturday, April 3, 1926.) "
225,DOCTOR: (sotto) 1926? 
226,JO: (sotto) Convinced? 
227,DOCTOR: (sotto) No. 
228,"JO: (sotto) Oh, Doctor, you're so stubborn. And you ought to have an L"
229,plate for that police box of yours. You don't even know where you're
230,going in it. 
231,"DOCTOR: (sotto) Come on, Jo. "
232,JO: (sotto) Where to? 
233,DOCTOR: (sotto) Back to the Tardis. 
234,JO: (sotto) What for? 
235,"DOCTOR: (sotto) Well, I don't know what's happening here, but I don't"
236,like it. Why do you want to stay? 
237,"JO: (sotto) I just want you to admit the truth, that's all. Well,"
238,"instead of swanning around some distant galaxy, we've slipped back"
239,about forty years in time and we're on a little cargo boat in the
240,middle of the Indian Ocean. 
241,(Roar outside. Claire screams. Jo and the Doctor duck back into
242,hiding.) 
243,DALY: What? What? What? What? What? 
244,(Claire and Andrews rush in.) 
245,"CLAIRE: Daddy, there's something terrible out there in the sea! "
246,DALY: What's going on? 
247,ANDREWS: Some kind of monster! 
248,(Through the open doorway we see a large head with equally large teeth
249,rear up level with it. The crew sound as if they are panicking.) 
250,DALY: What the deuce is it? 
251,DOCTOR: That's a plesiosaurus! 
252,JO: What? 
253,"DOCTOR: It's incredible! If this really is 1926, the plesiosaurus has"
254,been extinct for a hundred and thirty million years! 
255,"(With a final roar, the dinosaur goes back under the waves.) "
256,DALY: It's gone back in the sea. 
257,"ANDREWS: I'd better get a rifle, Major. It might attack again. Here,"
258,"sir, if you'll just look after Claire a moment. "
259,"DALY: Yes, yes, yes, of course. I say, what a monstrous beast. "
260,"CLAIRE: It was awful, horrible! "
261,"DALY: There, there, there, my child. You'd better come and sit down."
262,I've never seen anything like it in me life. I wonder if it'll come
263,back? 
264,"CLAIRE: Oh, no! "
265,"DALY: Hmm? Oh, you look as if you need a peg. Might get a shot at the"
266,beast next time. 
267,(Daly goes to the drinks tray. The Doctor sees that their coast is
268,clear.) 
269,DOCTOR: (silent) Come on. 
270,"DALY: What a head, eh? Gad, I'd love to have that on the club wall,"
271,what? 
272,"(Claire spots the Doctor and Jo, and squeals.) "
273,DALY: Hello? 
274,"DOCTOR: Hello. Topping day, what? "
275,DALY: Just a minute. You two passengers? 
276,"DOCTOR: Er, yes, but only temporarily. "
277,DALY: What? 
278,"JO: Oh, he means only to Bombay. "
279,DALY: But I thought my daughter and I were the only passengers. 
280,CLAIRE: Where did you come aboard? 
281,JO: Port Said. 
282,CLAIRE: I don't understand. Why haven't we met before? 
283,"JO: Ah, well you see, my uncle hasn't been terribly well, so "
284,"DALY: Ah, poor traveller, eh? Not used to it, I suppose. "
285,"DOCTOR: On that contrary, sir, I "
286,"DALY: Well, never mind. We've now got a four for bridge, what? "
287,DOCTOR: Yes. 
288,DALY: Or would you prefer Mah Jong? 
289,DOCTOR: Yes. 
290,(Andrews enters.) 
291,"ANDREWS: Not a sign of the beast, Major. Who are these people? "
292,"DALY: Well, don't you know, Andrews? "
293,CLAIRE: They said they joined the ship at Port Said. 
294,"ANDREWS: Stowaways, eh? "
295,DALY: Stowaways! 
296,ANDREWS: Where have you been hiding? 
297,"JO: You tell them, uncle."
298,
299, [Space Port]
300,
301," (We meet another of the native fussy aliens, this"
302,one in a floor length coat.) 
303,PLETRAC: Another functionary has dared to ascend to the higher level. 
304,KALIK: One witnessed the event. 
305,ORUM: One cannot understand why they do it. 
306,KALIK: But then one is not a functionary. 
307,"PLETRAC: It is a growing problem. As members of the official species,"
308,we must all share President Zarb's concern. 
309,ORUM: They've no sense of responsibility. Give them a hygiene chamber
310,and they store fossil fuel in it.
311,
312, [Saloon cabin]
313,
314," DALY: Look, let's all have a drink and discuss"
315,"this thing like civilised people, what? "
316,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's an excellent idea, Major. I'll have a large scotch."
317,
318,"ANDREWS: Major Daly, these people are stowaways, quite possibly even"
319,"criminals, and either unable or unwilling to give a satisfactory"
320,account of themselves. 
321,"DALY: Hang it all, Andrews. The fellow is a sahib, you know. "
322,"ANDREWS: This is not a social occasion, Major. "
323,"DALY: Oh, all right. Have it your own way. Though we can't extend back"
324,hospitality to a couple of poor wretched people in the 
325,"ANDREWS: Well, actually, sir, I should like to extend to them the"
326,hospitality of your cabin. 
327,DALY: Eh? What? 
328,ANDREWS: Until the Captain is free to see them. 
329,"DALY: Yes, very well. You may certainly have my cabin. "
330,"ANDREWS: Thank you, sir. In that case, you two follow me. (to a sailor)"
331,You bring up the rear. 
332,"SAILOR: Yes, sir. "
333,DOCTOR: I told you we should have left I wanted to. 
334,(Jo and the Doctor are led through an internal door down into the crew
335,quarters part of the ship.)
336,
337, [Below decks]
338,
339,(The Doctor spots something on the floor.) 
340,"DOCTOR: Here, Jo. Look at this. "
341,"ANDREWS: Come on, in here. "
342,"DOCTOR: Any more of these about on the ship, or is this the only one? "
343,ANDREWS: What? 
344,DOCTOR: These. Is this the only one? 
345,"(It is a hexagonal steel plate about an inch high, apparently riveted"
346,to the floor and easy to trip over. 
347,ANDREWS: There's nothing there. 
348,JO: Do you mean you can't see it? 
349,ANDREWS: Get into this cabin! 
350,(Jo enters the cabin.) 
351,ANDREWS: And you.
352,
353, [Daly's cabin]
354,
355, (Jo sits on the end of the bed.) 
356,ANDREWS: I have a crew of Lascars who try to make a fool of me on every
357,"trip. They've never managed it yet, and neither will you. "
358,"DOCTOR: Don't underestimate us, sir. "
359,(There is a plan of the ship in a frame on the wall.) 
360,"DOCTOR: Tell me, is this ship the SS Bernice? "
361,ANDREWS: You trying to pretend you didn't even know that? 
362,"DOCTOR: I didn't, but I do now. It makes everything much clearer. Thank"
363,you. 
364,ANDREWS: All right. Now I'm going to lock you in here until the Captain
365,"is ready to see you, and that might not be for a long time. He's a busy"
366,man. 
367,(Andrews leaves.) 
368,"JO: All right, Doctor. What's clear? "
369,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
370,JO: You said everything seemed much clearer now. 
371,"DOCTOR: Yes, relatively speaking. An extinct monster, that plate out"
372,"there on the deck. Yes, this is all most interesting. "
373,JO: Do you really believe Andrews couldn't see it? 
374,DOCTOR: What? 
375,"JO: Well, the plate in the floor. "
376,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, it's been blocked from his consciousness. Yes. If I'm"
377,"right, it would have to be. It's certainly no part of the fabric of"
378,this ship. 
379,JO: I'd say it was very much a part of the ship. A great lump of 
380,"DOCTOR: A great lump of what? It's not steel, copper or iron. That"
381,"metal is unknown on Earth, Jo. "
382,"JO: But we are on Earth. We must be. I mean, this ship, the people, the"
383,"chickens. Oh, come on, Doctor, you're not going to tell me that Major"
384,"Daly is an alien from another planet, are you? "
385,DOCTOR: No. 
386,JO: Well then? 
387,"DOCTOR: Oh, look. Daly's been keeping track of the date. "
388,(Everything up to Tuesday 4th June are crossed off.) 
389,"DOCTOR: I suppose the name of this ship means nothing to you, Jo? "
390,JO: No. Should it? 
391,"DOCTOR: Well, in its time, the SS Bernice was as famous a sea mystery"
392,as the Marie Celeste. 
393,JO: Why? What happened? 
394,DOCTOR: Nobody really knows. A freak tidal wave was the popular
395,"explanation, although the Indian Ocean was as flat as a millpond on"
396,that night. 
397,JO: You mean she sank? 
398,"DOCTOR: No, she vanished, Jo. Two days out from Bombay on June the 4th,"
399,"1926, the SS Bernice just disappeared off the face of the Earth. "
400,"JO: Disappeared on June the, June the 4th? But according to that"
401,"calendar, that's today. "
402,"DOCTOR: Yes, intriguing, isn't it? "
403,JO: Shall I tell you something else intriguing? 
404,DOCTOR: Mmm hmm. 
405,"JO: When we came in here, that clock said twenty five to eight. "
406,DOCTOR: Well? 
407,"JO: Well, now look at it. "
408,(The clock says twenty to seven.) 
409,"DOCTOR: Oh, you've noticed that, have you? Well done. Shall I tell you"
410,something that you may not have noticed? It's broad daylight outside. 
411,JO: So? 
412,"DOCTOR: If this really is after dinner, and we are in the Indian Ocean,"
413,it should be pitch dark. 
414,JO: I don't get it. 
415,(The Doctor checks the door lock.) 
416,JO: Sonic screwdriver? 
417,"DOCTOR: No, that only works on electronic locks, Jo. We need something"
418,far more primitive. 
419,JO: Skeleton keys. 
420,"DOCTOR: Oh, they'd do fine if only we had any. "
421,"JO: Allow me, Doctor."
422,
423, [Space Port]
424,
425," PLETRAC: From your data discs, it appear that you"
426,travel from planet to planet performing some kind of ritual with this
427,machine? For what purpose? 
428,SHIRNA: We are entertainers. 
429,PLETRAC: Entertainers? Explain the term. 
430,SHIRNA: We put on a show. You understand? 
431,(Shirna does a little tap dance.) 
432,PLETRAC: No. 
433,"VORG: Our purpose is to amuse, simply to amuse. Nothing serious,"
434,nothing political. 
435,(The three locals move away to confer.) 
436,KALIK: Amusement is prohibited. It's purposeless. 
437,PLETRAC: Zarb is considering lifting that restriction. The latest
438,thinking is that the latest outbreak of violence among the
439,functionaries is caused through lack of amusement. 
440,"KALIK: Oh, more anti-productive legislation. "
441,ORUM: Where will it end? 
442,"KALIK: One can see where it will end, Orum. Ultimately, the"
443,functionaries will take over. 
444,ORUM: Take over? 
445,"PLETRAC: It is not the functionaries who dream of power, Kalik. "
446,KALIK: Huh? One simply speaks one's thoughts. 
447,PLETRAC: Your thoughts are as clear as your ambitions. 
448,KALIK: How dare 
449,ORUM: Please! One is simply here to decide whether to grant these
450,Lurmans an entrance visa. 
451,"KALIK: Since their presence here is clearly subversive, one moves that"
452,their application be rejected. 
453,PLETRAC: Opposed. 
454,ORUM: Supported. 
455,"PLETRAC: Oh, very well. "
456,(They return to Vorg and Shirna.) 
457,PLETRAC: Your application for a visa has been rejected. You will be
458,allotted space on the next outbound cargo thruster. 
459,"VORG: But your worship, please, I beg you. We spent our last credit bar"
460,on the journey here. 
461,KALIK: That was unwise. 
462,"VORG: Your worship, please. I have a document here micrographed by the"
463,great Zarb himself. If you will just do me the honour of considering
464,it. 
465,PLETRAC: President Zarb? 
466,(Pletrac takes the cassette and leaves.) 
467,SHIRNA: Wasn't the Great Zarb that Walarian wrestler we met at the
468,instellar exhibition? 
469,VORG: Shush! Shut up! 
470,"SHIRNA: You've got a nerve, Vorg, passing that off."
471,
472, [Below decks]
473,
474, (The Doctor and Jo are looking at the strange
475,plate in the floor.) 
476,DOCTOR: It slides open. 
477,JO: How does it work? 
478,"DOCTOR: Anti-magnetic cohesion, I should think. "
479,JO: Never heard of it. 
480,"DOCTOR: No, you wouldn't have done, Jo. You were born about a thousand"
481,years too early for that. 
482,"JO: Oh, I do love being with you, Doctor. You make me feel so young."
483,Can you open it? 
484,"DOCTOR: Without a magnetic core extractor, no. "
485,"JO: Oh, well. That's that, then, isn't it. "
486,DOCTOR: On the contrary. I happen to have got one in the Tardis. 
487,"JO: Oh, I knew you wouldn't travel anywhere without one. But there's"
488,one tiny little problem. 
489,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know, getting to the Tardis. "
490,JO: Right. It means we've got to go through the saloon. 
491,"DOCTOR: They can only lock us up again, can't they. "
492,JO: True. 
493,DOCTOR: Come on.
494,
495, [Saloon cabin]
496,
497," DALY: You say the cook's a Madrasi, Andrews? "
498,"ANDREWS: I believe so, sir. "
499,DALY: Hmm. I find the Madrasis a bit idle myself. Won't have them on
500,"the plantation. Still, I must admit your fellow knows how to curry a"
501,chicken. Sundowner? 
502,"ANDREWS: Er, not for me, sir. "
503,DALY: Claire? 
504,"CLAIRE: No, thank you, Daddy. John and I thought we'd take a turn"
505,around the deck. 
506,"ANDREWS: Would you care to join us, sir? It's a glorious evening."
507,
508, [Outside the saloon]
509,
510," DALY : No, no, no, no, no. You two run along."
511,I'm going to do a spot of reading. Determined to finish this book
512,before we reach Bombay. 
513,"CLAIRE : Well, we're due there tomorrow. How much have you got"
514,left? 
515,DALY : Only another two chapters. 
516,"ANDREWS : Well, we'll see you later then, sir. "
517,DALY : Right. 
518,"ANDREWS : Twenty times round the deck is a mile, Claire. So, if we"
519,put our best feet forward 
520,"JO: (sotto) Doctor, they're saying exactly the same things as before. "
521,"DOCTOR: (sotto) Yes, I know. "
522,JO: (sotto) But if he 
523,DOCTOR: (sotto) Shush.
524,
525, [Saloon cabin]
526,
527, (Daly falls asleep.) 
528,"CLAIRE : No, really, I love musical plays. I saw Lady be good four"
529,times. And don't you think that young American chap was marvellous? You
530,"know, Fred somebody? Fred Astaire."
531,
532, [Outside the saloon]
533,
534," ANDREWS : Personally, I think "
535,DOCTOR: (silent) Come on.
536,
537, [Saloon cabin]
538,
539," JO: (sotto) Come on, Doctor. Let's get out of"
540,here. 
541,"DOCTOR: (sotto) In a minute, Jo. If my theory's right, we should be"
542,getting confirmation any minute now. 
543,JO: (sotto) Theory? What theory? 
544,DOCTOR: (sotto) About what's happening to this ship. 
545,"JO: (sotto) What is happening? I mean, it's like a gramophone record. A"
546,stuck gramophone record. 
547,"DOCTOR: (sotto) Yes, well, naturally. You see, they've all been"
548,programmed to repeat a simple behaviour pattern. 
549,"JO: (sotto) And that monster, the plesiosaurus, that was programmed"
550,too? 
551,DOCTOR: (sotto) Very probably. 
552,JO: (sotto) But that was from a different time. They weren't any
553,plesiosaurus's in 1926. 
554,"DOCTOR: (sotto) Yes, exactly. Historically speaking, this collection is"
555,"a bit of a jumble, I must admit. "
556,JO: (sotto) Do you mean that this ship is part of a collection? But it
557,all seems so ordinary. 
558,"DOCTOR: (sotto) Jo, have you ever seen any small boys collecting sea"
559,creatures and putting them into a rock pool? 
560,JO: Hmm. 
561,DOCTOR: (sotto) And then after a minute all the sea creatures settle
562,"down and behave quite normally, quite naturally. It's only the small"
563,boys looking down from above that see the change in the environment. 
564,"JO: (sotto) Oh, yes, but that's different. Human beings are slightly"
565,more intelligent than whelks. 
566,"DOCTOR: (sotto) Yes, and they were collected by a slightly more"
567,"sophisticated means than a bucket of water. But everything is relative,"
568,Jo. 
569,"JO: I'm sorry, Doctor, I just can't take it in. "
570,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, don't worry about it. Right, stand by for blasting. "
571,"JO: Wait a minute, do you mean "
572,DOCTOR: Shush. Right. Go and hide. (They duck down behind the settee.
573,"The Doctor checks the exact time that the monster roars, Claire screams"
574,and Daly wakes up.) 
575,DALY: What? What? What? 
576,"CLAIRE: Oh, Daddy, there's something dreadful out there! "
577,DALY: What's going on? 
578,"ANDREWS: Some kind of monster, sir! "
579,(The plesiosaurus appears.) 
580,DALY: What the deuce is it? 
581,(The plesiosaurus returns to the deep.) 
582,DALY: It's gone back in the sea! 
583,"ANDREWS: I'd better get a rifle, Major. It might attack again. Here,"
584,"Major, if you'll just look after Claire a moment? "
585,"DALY: Oh. Yes, yes, of course. I say, what a monstrous beast! "
586,"CLAIRE: Yes, it was awful, horrible! "
587,"DALY: There, there, there, child. You'd better come and sit down. I've"
588,never seen anything like it in me life! I wonder if it'll come back? 
589,CLAIRE: Oh no! 
590,"DALY: Oh, oh, you look as if you need a peg. Might get a shot at the"
591,beast next time. 
592,(This time the Doctor and Jo make it out onto the main deck unnoticed.)
593,
594,"DALY: What a head, eh? By gad, I'd love to have that on the club wall,"
595,what?
596,
597, [Cargo hold]
598,
599," DOCTOR: Hang on a minute, Jo. I'll get the"
600,magnetic core extractor. 
601,(The Doctor goes into the Tardis.) 
602,"JO: Doctor, do we have to stay here? Can't we just leave? "
603,"DOCTOR : Where's your scientific curiosity, Jo? Don't you want to"
604,know what's going on? 
605,"JO: Not much, no. Doctor! "
606,DOCTOR : What is it now? 
607,JO: Doctor! 
608,(The Doctor comes out of the Tardis.) 
609,"DOCTOR: What is it, Jo? "
610,JO: Look! 
611,(A gigantic hand reaches down through the deck and picks up the
612,Tardis.) 
613, Episode Two
614,
615, [Cargo hold]
616,
617, DOCTOR: Hey! 
618,JO: Where's it gone? 
619,DOCTOR: Up there. 
620,JO: But there's no way through. Are you sure? 
621,"DOCTOR: Yes, the whole deckhead swings open. "
622,JO: But it's solid steel. It must weigh tons and tons. 
623,"DOCTOR: Yes, and probably held in place by two tiny little wingnuts. "
624,JO: Tiny? 
625,DOCTOR: Relatively speaking. You saw the size of that hand. 
626,JO: But there's only deck above here. 
627,DOCTOR: That's what it looks like. 
628,JO: But we've been up there. 
629,"DOCTOR: I told you this was no ordinary ship, Jo. "
630,JO: Where are you going? 
631,"DOCTOR: To find the Tardis, and that means finding a way off this ship."
632,
633, [Space Port]
634,
635, (Vorg has his hand inside the Scope.) 
636,"SHIRNA: Vorg, they're coming over. "
637,VORG: Good. I think I've found the trouble anyway. There you are. A bit
638,of bric-a-brac lodged inside circuit three. 
639,(A two inch long Tardis.) 
640,VORG: I'd better put it back. Might spoil the illusion. Never let the
641,customer see too much.
642,
643, [Main deck]
644,
645, (The Doctor and Jo sneak along the deck. Claire
646,and Andrews are still taking their twenty laps.) 
647,CLAIRE : But I loved Choo Chin Chow. Daddy took me when I was a
648,little girl. 
649,(The Doctor and Jo hide from the couple standing on the upper deck.) 
650,"ANDREWS: Choo Chin Chow! I tell you, the whole thing's absolute"
651,rubbish. 
652,"CLAIRE: Oh, it wasn't. How can you say that? "
653,"ANDREWS: Well, I've sailed into Shanghai fifty times, my girl. I know"
654,what Johnny Chinaman's like. 
655,"CLAIRE: Oh, John, you've seen so much of the world. It makes me seem"
656,"so, so unsophisticated. "
657,JO: Suppose we're due for the monster bit any minute now. 
658,"DOCTOR: Yes, very probably. "
659,ANDREWS : You're different. 
660,CLAIRE : I wouldn't want you to think I'm just a silly flapper.
661,
662, [Space Port]
663,
664, KALIK: In what way does this machine amuse? 
665,"VORG: Your worship, allow me to demonstrate. If you will watch the"
666,glo-sphere. 
667,(Claire and Andrews appear on the round screen.) 
668,ORUM: What is this? 
669,"VORG: These creatures are Tellurians, a species discovered in a distant"
670,galaxy. Scientists have been amazed at the remarkable similarity
671,between these little chaps and our own dominant lifeform. 
672,ORUM: The resemblance is unpleasant. 
673,VORG: These are the only Tellurians in captivity. Some scientists think
674,that their discovery refutes Valdek's theory that life in the universe
675,is infinitely variable. An even more interesting though less amusing
676,form of life is the Ogron. 
677,(The picture changes.) 
678,VORG: They are of limited intelligence and are used as servants by some
679,"race called, er, Daleks, I believe. We will shortly be seeing the prize"
680,of my collection. The Drashigs! 
681,KALIK: Drashigs? 
682,"VORG: They are, without doubt, the most evil, the most vicious and"
683,undoubtedly the most frightening form of life in the whole of the
684,universe! 
685,"SHIRNA: Oh look, there's one. "
686,(Something with lots of eyes on stalks sinks into a mist.) 
687,KALIK: Amazing. 
688,"VORG: The Drashigs have no intelligence centre, unfortunately, so I"
689,cannot control their behaviour. 
690,"ORUM: But these pictures, they are recorded, surely? "
691,"VORG: Oh no, your worship. The Scope is good, old-fashioned live"
692,entertainment. The picture on the glo-sphere is an actual projection of
693,what is now taking place deep down inside. 
694,KALIK: Do you mean that all these creatures are living in there? 
695,"VORG: Within their own miniaturised environments, of course. I'll"
696,switch back to circuit three.
697,
698, [Main deck]
699,
700, (Where the plesiosaurus is doing its thing. Claire
701,screams.) 
702,ANDREWS: Great heavens! 
703,"JO: Just like goldfish in a bowl, aren't they, going round and round"
704,forever. Isn't there anything we can do for them? 
705,"DOCTOR: No, not while we're inside this thing. We've got to get out of"
706,here. Come on.
707,
708, [Saloon cabin]
709,
710," DALY: What a head, eh? By gad, I'd love to have"
711,"that on the club wall, what? "
712,(The Doctor and Jo try to sneak through but are spotted before they can
713,open the inner door.) 
714,"DALY: Oh, hello! "
715,"DOCTOR: Oh, hello. Topping day, what? "
716,DALY: Absolutely splendid. 
717,"DOCTOR: Yes, ninety nine skidoo! Well, must press on. Pip pip, old"
718,chap. 
719,DALY: Just a minute. You two passengers? 
720,DOCTOR: You've asked us that question once before. Don't you remember? 
721,"DALY: Have I? I'm sorry to be uncivil and all that, but "
722,"DOCTOR: You see, Jo. No memory traces at all. "
723,"DALY: What's that? Do you know, you'll think I'm an awful idiot, but do"
724,you know 
725,DOCTOR: You've forgotten our names. 
726,"DALY: What's that? Well, I never knew them. I've never bally well seen"
727,you in all me life before!
728,
729, [Space Port]
730,
731," VORG: Now, by simply adjusting the aggrometer, the"
732,peaceful Tellurians can be made to behave in an amusingly violent way.
733,Watch.
734,
735, [Saloon cabin]
736,
737, (Andrews and an armed sailor have entered.) 
738,ANDREWS: Right! 
739,"CLAIRE: What are you doing, John? "
740,ANDREWS: I'm going to thrash this fellow within an inch of his life! 
741,(Jo takes the Doctor's jacket.) 
742,ANDREWS: Still sticking to that stupid story? 
743,"DOCTOR: I'm afraid so, old chap. "
744,"ANDREWS: You'll regret it, sir. I think I ought to warn you, I used to"
745,box for my school. 
746,DOCTOR: And I think I ought to warn you that I took lessons from  John L
747,Sullivan himself. 
748,"DALY: By Jiminy, the old fellow's got some pluck. "
749,DOCTOR: Queensbury rules? 
750,ANDREWS: Naturally. 
751,(The Doctor jabs at Andrews but gets a punch to the stomach in return.
752,"He hits Andrews below the heart, making him stagger, gasp and fall.) "
753,CLAIRE: John! 
754,DOCTOR: Good afternoon. 
755,(Jo and the Doctor run back out onto the deck.) 
756,"ANDREWS: Cover the aft companionway. Quick! Right, come on."
757,
758, [Main deck]
759,
760, ANDREWS: Stop or I'll fire! 
761,(Jo and the Doctor round a corner just in time. They try to open
762,another door and fail so they climb a ladder to the upper deck. Andrews
763,tries another shot.) 
764,"JO: Oh, how many times round the deck is a mile? "
765,DOCTOR: Who's counting? 
766,(And down the ladder on the other side.) 
767,DOCTOR: Let's try that door. 
768,"(This one opens, but they are spotted going inside.) "
769,ANDREWS: Now we've got them. Patel!
770,
771, [Below decks]
772,
773, DOCTOR: This way. 
774,(They get to the metal plate in the flooring and the Doctor gets out
775,the device he retrieved from the Tardis. The Indian sailors are all
776,armed and shouting at each other as they search. The Doctor closes a
777,bulkhead to stop a bullet.) 
778,JO: How does this thing work? 
779,DOCTOR: Hold it flat. Run it along the edge of the plate. 
780,JO: Right. 
781,DOCTOR: That's the idea. 
782,"ANDREWS: All right, on your feet. "
783,DALY: We've had enough of your nonsense. 
784,"ANDREWS: Right, bosun. "
785,(The rifle bolts are pulled back.) 
786,JO: Doctor. 
787,"DOCTOR: No, you can't!"
788,
789, [Space Port]
790,
791, VORG: I can't it for too long or the specimens
792,start damaging each other.
793,
794, [Below decks]
795,
796, (There is a high-pitched whine.) 
797,"DALY: Ah, dinner. Splendid! Coming? "
798,"(The sailors leave, and Andrews and Daly follow.) "
799,DALY: Who the devil are those two? 
800,"ANDREWS: I say, I hope there's something decent tonight. "
801,DALY: Yes! 
802,ANDREWS: I'm feeling rather peckish.
803,
804, [Space Port]
805,
806," SHIRNA: Hey, Vorg. Do you know, I'd swear I'd"
807,never seen those two before? 
808,VORG: What? 
809,SHIRNA: Those two Tellurians. Have you seen them before? 
810,"VORG: Oh, really, Shirna. I mean, they all look so much alike. "
811,"SHIRNA: They're new, Vorg. They're strangers."
812,
813, [Below decks] 
814, (Jo carries on running the device round the edge
815,of the plate.) 
816,DOCTOR: And here. That should do it. Yes. 
817,(They slide the plate aside to reveal a hexagonal hole in the floor.) 
818,JO: Looks like some sort of shaft. 
819,DOCTOR: Good. Down we go.
820,
821, [Inside the Scope]
822,
823," DOCTOR: Just look at this filter circuit, Jo. What"
824,"a beautiful piece of work. Now then, this must be the output and that"
825,must be the input through there. Let's have a look. 
826,(They bend down to make their way through the giant circuitry.) 
827,"DOCTOR: Yes, it is. "
828,JO: What is it? 
829,"DOCTOR: What is it? My dear girl, this is a perfect example of an early"
830,"pulse mechanism based on the principal of caesium decay. Oh, this is"
831,absolutely vintage stuff. 
832,JO: But this can't be the ship's engine room? 
833,"DOCTOR: Well, of course it isn't. I told you. We're no longer in the"
834,ship. 
835,"JO: Well, where's the Tardis? "
836,DOCTOR: I've no idea. Probably outside this machine entirely. And just
837,"look at this, Jo. What a magnificent auxiliary capillary pump. Have you"
838,ever seen anything like it? 
839,(They walk along a metal strip and clamber over another unit.) 
840,DOCTOR: I've never been small enough to get inside one of these things
841,before. It's fascinating! It's like walking around inside a wristwatch.
842,It's wonderful. It really is magnificent. 
843,"JO: Well, can't we just find the way out? "
844,DOCTOR: We could try following this circuit. It'll probably run for
845,miles though.
846,
847, [Space Port]
848,
849, (Pletrac returns with the cassette Vorg gave him.)
850,
851,PLETRAC: Out of the way. Not authentic! 
852,VORG: What? 
853,PLETRAC: A forgery. 
854,"VORG: A forgery? But your worship, I had no idea. And my assistant and"
855,I travelled all the way from Demos believing that we would be welcome
856,on your noble planet. 
857,PLETRAC: That is your misfortune. 
858,"KALIK: Pletrac, this machine, this Scope, contains many alien"
859,creatures. The Lurman has imported them without a licence. 
860,PLETRAC: What? 
861,"VORG: If I've done something wrong, I "
862,KALIK: The Interstellar Ecology Commission expressly forbids the
863,transference of zoological specimens between planets. 
864,ORUM: The creatures will have to be destroyed. 
865,VORG: Destroyed? 
866,"PLETRAC: The machine, too. "
867,SHIRNA: You can't do that! Our livelihood depends on the Scope! 
868,VORG: We're just simple strolling players. 
869,PLETRAC: Destroyed! 
870,(Pletrac speaks into his wrist communicator.) 
871,PLETRAC: Send the eradicator detachment to section two immediately. 
872,VORG: Barbarians. 
873,"SHIRNA: Dim witted yokels, you said they were. Twist them round your"
874,"finger, you said. Have them eating off of your hand, you said. Well, a"
875,"fine mess we're in now, aren't we. "
876,VORG: You're not blaming me? 
877,"SHIRNA: Well, I didn't want to come here, Vorg. I should have stayed"
878,with the All Star dance company. 
879,VORG: Huh. That third rate bunch of hoofers. 
880,SHIRNA: At least when I was with the company I always had a few credit
881,"bars, and we never travelled by cargo thruster. "
882,"PLETRAC: Eradicator detachment, follow me. "
883,(Two functionaries wheel in a large gun on a stand.) 
884,VORG: What's that? 
885,VORG: This is murder! Assassination! 
886,"PLETRAC: Stand aside, you two. "
887,"VORG: I'm not without influence, you know. I shall complain. "
888,PLETRAC: Prepare to erad. Wait. 
889,"(Pletrac goes to stand further away, by Orum and Kalik.) "
890,PLETRAC: Commence eradication. (The gun emits red energy which envelops
891,the Scope.)
892,
893, [Inside the Scope]
894,
895, (And heats up the innards.) 
896,"JO: What's happening, Doctor? "
897,"DOCTOR: I don't know. Hold on, Jo! "
898,JO: It's some kind of earthquake. It's getting hotter and hotter. 
899,DOCTOR: Come on. Keep moving.
900,
901, [Space Port]
902,
903, (The eradicator is switched off.) 
904,KALIK: Bravo. 
905,PLETRAC: The machine must be armoured. 
906,"KALIK: We have lost face, Pletrac. Our technology has proved deficient."
907,
908,ORUM: The eradicator was designed only for use against organic
909,molecules. 
910,PLETRAC: And the creatures in there? 
911,ORUM: They are organic. The eradicator will have destroyed them. 
912,PLETRAC: That is the main objective. Destruction of the machine is
913,unimportant. 
914,"(Orum, Kalik, Pletrac and the functionaries leave.) "
915,"VORG: Ha, ha! Built, eh? None of your modern rubbish! Oh! "
916,(The Scope casing is still hot.)

925,"JO: Not yet, I'm only half-cooked. "
926,"DOCTOR: Come on, get yourself up. Come on, give us your hand. Come on,"
927,"up. There. Here, mop yourself down with this. "
928,"JO: Thanks. Wow, what happened? "
929,"DOCTOR: Well, it just a bit hot, didn't it? "
930,"JO: Hey, it was them. They did it on purpose. "

1186,fifty and all the latest armaments. They thought they could hold the
1187,Drashigs off.

1370,"VORG: You speak for yourself. Personally, I don't "
1371,KALIK: Silence! 
1372,ORUM: Broken out? 
1373,"SHIRNA: Well, they went into that cave after the Tellurians and none of"
1374,them have come out again. 
1375,ORUM: Where does the cave lead? 
1376,SHIRNA: Down into the supply lines. There's a control valve at the back
1377,of the cave. 
1378,"VORG: Look, if the Drashigs have broken out of their circuit, and I"
1379,"don't for one moment believe that they have, whose fault is it, Shirna?"
1380,Whose suggestion was it that I help the Tellurians escape? 
1381,KALIK: Mine. 
1382,"VORG: And a most merciful and compassionate gesture, your worship. "
1383,ORUM: Merciful and compassionate? 
1384,KALIK: One has twinges. 
1385,(The Doctor and Jo continue to scurry through the workings of the
1386,"Scope, as more Drashigs follow their scent. Orum and Kalik have moved"
1387,away from the Scope.) 
1388,ORUM: You expected the Drashigs 
1389,KALIK: Shush! 
1390,(They go to an area where they cannot be overheard.) 
1391,ORUM: You expected the Drashigs to follow the Tellurians? 
1392,"KALIK: They follow a scent blindly, so that primitive told us. "
1393,ORUM: What's to be gained by that? 
1394,KALIK: Possibly the world. 
1395,ORUM: What? 
1396,KALIK: The Tellurians will try to escape. 
1397,ORUM: And? 
1398,KALIK: The Drashigs will follow them. 
1399,ORUM: What good will that do any of us? 
1400,"KALIK: Listen, Orum. For thousands of years, ever since the great space"
1401,"plague, our world has stood alone and been the stronger for it. Now"
1402,Zarb is trying to change our ways. 
1403,ORUM: Because the functionaries are growing restive. They need
1404,distractions. 
1405,"KALIK: What the functionaries need, Orum, what we all need, is"
1406,something to unite us. We need a sense of purpose. We need a new
1407,leader. We need a war! 
1408,"ORUM: How do you propose to achieve all that, Kalik? "
1409,KALIK: By leading the rebellion against my dear brother Zarb.

1413, (The Doctor and Jo reach a sheer drop. The Doctor
1414,drops a coin and it hits bottom after five seconds.) 
1415,JO: Well? 
1416,"DOCTOR: Well, logically, there should be an extractor down there. Well,"
1417,"if I'd designed it, there would be one. "
1418,"JO: They're still following us, Doctor. "
1419,"DOCTOR: Yes. Persistent little beggars, aren't they? "
1420,"JO: Well, that's it. We're done for. "
1421,DOCTOR: I wonder? 
1422,"JO: Well, we'll break our necks if we try to get down there. We'll just"
1423,"go on wandering around this ghastly machine forever. Well, sooner or"
1424,"later, we'll crawl round a corner and run slap into one of them. "
1425,"DOCTOR: Things do look a little difficult at the moment, I must admit. "
1426,JO: Difficult? They're impossible. 
1427,"DOCTOR: Not impossible, Jo. Nothing's impossible. There's always an"
1428,answer if you can find it. 
1429,"JO: Yeah, such as? "
1430,"DOCTOR: Well, that's the trouble, finding it. Now I think this is the"
1431,time for lateral thinking. 
1432,JO: What? 
1433,"DOCTOR: Well, instead of approaching the problem from head on, you"
1434,approach it sort of sideways. 
1435,JO: Sideways? 
1436,"DOCTOR: Yes, take our own particular example for a moment, eh? This is"
1437,our problem. We can't go forward because this shaft is too steep. We
1438,can't go back the way we came because of our hungry little friends
1439,here. 
1440,"JO: Oh, I see. So we've got to go sideways. "
1441,"DOCTOR: Well, I didn't mean it quite so literally, Jo. If we move"
1442,"sideways, we'll find ourselves back on the ship. "
1443,"JO: Wait a minute, the ship! Well, that's it. There's rope on the ship,"
1444,"miles of it. We can use it to get down the shaft. Oh, Doctor, you're"
1445,brilliant! 
1446,DOCTOR: I am? 
1447,"JO: Yes, of course you are. I see what you mean now be lateral"
1448,"thinking. Come on, let's go. "
1449,"DOCTOR: Right, hang on a minute. Let's take a look at the plan. "
1450,JO: Right. 
1451,(The Doctor checks his notebook.) 
1452,"DOCTOR: Now, according to this plan, there should be a way back on the"
1453,ship just around the corner. Come on.

1456," SHIRNA: They must be in that upper section, Vorg."
1457,Can't you push them back into the circuit? 
1458,VORG: I'm not putting my hand in there again. 
1459,"SHIRNA: Well, think of something. They'll wreck the machine if you"
1460,leave them there. 
1461,"VORG: Look, all they're interested in, Shirna, is the Tellurians. The"
1462,"minute they're polished off, they'll probably follow their own trail"
1463,back home. 
1464,SHIRNA: Why don't you close down the support system? 
1465,VORG: Because I can't. We'd lose the entire collection.

1473,"DOCTOR: About a dozen fathoms, I should think. "
1474,JO: Fathoms? 
1475,"DOCTOR: Ah, here's some here. "
1476,"(There's the noise of a bulkhead door being unsealed, and they hide"
1477,behind packing cases.)

1479,"(Andrews enters, carrying a rife. Daly is behind him.) "
1480,"ANDREWS: Can't see anything here, Major. "
1481,"DALY: Well, I heard it quite plainly. Like the hound of the bally"
1482,Baskervilles! 
1483,"ANDREWS: Are you sure it came from here, sir? "
1484,"DALY: Positive, old boy. "
1485,"ANDREWS: Well, perhaps some of the cargo shifted. "
1486,"DALY: Oh, sea's a bit calm for that, isn't it? "
1487,"ANDREWS: Well, the vibration could have done it, sir. The skipper's got"
1488,"her up to full steam, trying to make up a few hours. "
1489,"DALY: Ah, Bombay tomorrow, eh? By Jove, I could do with a soak in a tub"
1490,"of fresh water, what? "
1491,(Andrews sees Jo's boot by a coil of rope.) 
1492,ANDREWS: All right. Come on out from there. It's no good lying doggo. I
1493,can see your foot.

1505,ORUM: Zarb's position is secure. How can a rebellion succeed? 
1506,KALIK: The Drashigs escape from the machine and then into the city.
1507,They would cause havoc before finally being destroyed. The Central
1508,Bureau would be forced to admit to serious miscalculation. And on whose
1509,"part, Orum? Who would be blamed? "
1510,ORUM: President Zarb. 
1511,KALIK: Exactly. The Drashigs are only here because of Zarb's
1512,liberal-minded weakness. 
1513,"ORUM: Popular feeling would be aroused against him, certainly."
1514,
1515, [Space Port]
1516,
1517, ORUM: But you're forgetting one thing.

1530,CLAIRE: What?

1540,"JO: Oh, well, anything for a change. "
1541,"ANDREWS: Not a pleasant change, I'm afraid. He's certain to put you"
1542,under arrest. 
1543,"JO: Well, last time he was too busy to see me. "
1544,DALY: Last time? 
1545,"JO: Well, yes, when I was put in your cabin, Major Daly. No, wait a"
1546,"minute. No, that wasn't last time. That was the time before. Oh, can't"
1547,any of you remember anything? 
1548,(The Doctor has a large coil of rope over his arm as he opens the door

1773,ORUM: Really? One almost admires its audacity. 
1774,"DOCTOR: You are, I take it, the representatives of authority on this"
1775,planet? 
1776,PLETRAC: One's authority comes direct from President Zarb himself. 
1777,DOCTOR: Then you have allowed the importation and the operation of a
1778,machine that is expressly forbidden by intergalactic law. 
1779,PLETRAC: One did not allow it! One has already ordered the deportation
1780,of the Lurmans and their machine. 
1781,DOCTOR: But for the moment the machine is here and it is in operation.
1782,Surely you'll scarcely deny that? 
1783,"PLETRAC: Well, strictly speaking, one must concede that, er, in a sense"
1784,

1793,ORUM: One is indeed overwhelmed. 
1794,"DOCTOR: If not, then you'll just have to take the consequences. Let me"
1795,know when you've made up your mind. 
1796,"VORG: Marvellous, Shirna! What audacity, eh? Do you know, I do believe"
1797,he's one of us? 
1798,SHIRNA: One of us? He's a Tellurian. 
1799,"VORG: Of course, but I recognise the type. He's in the carnival"
1800,"business, I'm sure. I mean, look at his manner and look at his clothes."
1801,Don't forget that I've worked many a Tellurian fairground. 
1802,SHIRNA: You may be right. He's certainly got the style. 
1803,"VORG: Oh, I'd wager on it. He's got the measure of these grey faced"
1804,idiots right enough. 
1805,"KALIK: Personally speaking, one is against this whole thing. "
1806,"PLETRAC: One might have expected you to take that attitude, Kalik."
1807,"Orum, are you for or against the use of the eradicator? "
1808,ORUM: Against. 
1809,"KALIK: You are outvoted, Pletrac. "
1810,"PLETRAC: Very well. Eradicator detachment, stand down. "
1811,"DOCTOR: Thank you for your timely intervention, sir. "
1812,PLETRAC: Wait! Where are you going? 
1813,DOCTOR: Just over there. 
1814,"KALIK: You're very nervous, Pletrac? "
1815,PLETRAC: Not nervous so much as puzzled. What use is the Tellurian to
1816,you? 
1817,KALIK: Of no use. 
1818,"PLETRAC: You never do anything without a reason, Kalik. Why did you try"
1819,to save the Tellurian's life? 
1820,KALIK: Out of mercy and compassion. Vorg will tell you. 
1821,(Kalik and Orum leave.) 
1822,VORG: I bet he understands the Polari. Listen to this. 
1823,SHIRNA: Eh? 
1824,VORG: The Tellurian carnival lingo. Watch. Polari la carny? 
1825,DOCTOR: I beg your pardon? 
1826,VORG: Vada the bona palone? 
1827,(Look at the lovely woman.) 
1828,DOCTOR: I'm sorry. 
1829,"VORG: Niente dinari round here, y'jills. "
1830,(No money... not sure about that last word.) 
1831,DOCTOR: I must apologise. I'm afraid I do not understand your language.
1832,
1833,"VORG: Oh, you understand, all right. You're a showman, the same as me,"
1834,ain't you. 
1835,"DOCTOR: Are you a showman, sir? "
1836,VORG: Allow me to introduce myself. I am the great Vorg! And this
1837,"beautiful young lady is Shirna, my assistant. "
1838,"DOCTOR: Delighted, Miss Shirna. I am the Doctor. "
1839,"VORG: Doctor. Great title, you know. Doctors, Professors, always pulls"
1840,them in. 
1841,"DOCTOR: Tell me, sir, are you in charge of this disgraceful device? "
1842,"VORG: Yes, why? Is something wrong? "
1843,"DOCTOR: Yes, something is very wrong. I too have an assistant, you"
1844,"know, and she's trapped inside this machine. Now somehow I've got to"
1845,get her out. 
1846,"VORG: Oh, Doctor, Doctor! I wouldn't put your hand in there. Those"
1847,Drashigs can take a lump right out of you. 
1848,DOCTOR: Drashigs? 
1849,SHIRNA: They followed you out of the circuit. They're running wild
1850,"inside there now. Doing terrible damage, aren't they, Vorg? "
1851,"VORG: Oh, they've broken the statofields. Very soon, I'm going to lose"
1852,the entire collection. 
1853,"DOCTOR: What, lose them? That would be a tragedy. "
1854,VORG: You can say that again. My insurance doesn't cover the
1855,replacement of livestock. 
1856,"DOCTOR: Livestock? Let me tell you, sir, that the people inside that"
1857,ship are human beings. 
1858,"VORG: That's right. Tellurians, Ogrons, Drashigs. Oh, marvellous"
1859,collection. 
1860,DOCTOR: The collection of the simplest animal lifeforms is a dubious
1861,"enough pursuit in itself, sir, but the collection of civilised"
1862,intelligent beings is a positive crime. Now let me warn you that I
1863,intend to put an end to this shameful business. 
1864,VORG: There's no need to get excited. It's putting an end to itself. 
1865,DOCTOR: Huh? What does that mean? 
1866,VORG: The scope's packing up. All the life support systems are going to
1867,break down soon. 
1868,"SHIRNA: Even on tickover, the power's almost down to critical. "
1869,DOCTOR: How long will it last? 
1870,VORG: Who knows? Can't be much longer. 
1871,"DOCTOR: Well, that means that every living creature in there will die,"
1872,"including my assistant! Now somehow, I've got to find a way of saving"
1873,them.

1885,"KALIK: Trying to rescue the other Tellurian, one imagines. "
1886,ORUM: They are clearly social creatures. 
1887,"KALIK: Mmm, and harmless. "
1888,ORUM: Pletrac is growing suspicious. If he should decide to examine the
1889,"eradicator, he will discover that one has rendered it useless. "
1890,"KALIK: You worry too much, Orum. "
1891,ORUM: President Zarb still decrees the death penalty for acts of
1892,treason. 
1893,KALIK: Have you destroyed the part? 
1894,ORUM: What part? 
1895,KALIK: From the eradicator. 
1896,"ORUM: Oh, you mean the trizon? Yes, it's here. "
1897,KALIK: We will conceal it in the Lurman's baggage. Then if anything
1898,"should go wrong, one of us can always discover it. "
1899,ORUM: Of course! Blame it on the Lurman. 
1900,KALIK: An alien spy and saboteur.

1915,SHIRNA: Vorg! 
1916,(A panel at the base of the Scope is rattling.) 
1917,VORG: That's odd. The Drashigs! 
1918,"SHIRNA: They've reached the outer hull. Vorg, if they get out, they'll"
1919,expand to full size. 
1920,"VORG: Come on, it's time we left. Come on. "
1921,PLETRAC: And where are you going? 
1922,"VORG: Er, where are we going, yes. "
1923,SHIRNA: Home? 
1924,VORG: Home. We thought we'd take a shuttle out to the thruster base. 
1925,"PLETRAC: A transporter has been ordered for you. You will be taken,"
1926,"together with your machine, to the thruster base. "
1927,"VORG: There's no need to worry. I mean, we can find our own way. Don't"
1928,bother. You can keep the Scope. You're welcome to it. 
1929,PLETRAC: You will remain here until the transporter arrives! The
1930,quarantine regulation on the conveyance of aliens is explicit. You will
1931,be taken to the thruster base in a transporter which we then be
1932,disinfected before further use. 
1933,VORG: Disinfected? 
1934,(Pletrac takes out a hand weapon and points it at Vorg.)

1947, (The Doctor removes a melted transistor from the
1948,Scope.) 
1949,DOCTOR: Vorg? 
1950,"VORG: Doctor, I shouldn't stay too near the Scope. The Drashigs, you"
1951,know. 
1952,"DOCTOR: Listen, Vorg, I shall need your help. I've got to get back"
1953,inside this machine. 
1954,VORG: What? 
1955,"DOCTOR: Well, it's the only way I can get Jo out of there in time and"
1956,save the rest of your livestock. But I shall need you to trigger the
1957,settings for me. 
1958,VORG: Settings? 
1959,"DOCTOR: Look, this is your machine, isn't it? "
1960,"VORG: Well, of course it is. Why? "
1961,DOCTOR: Then I presume you know how it works. 
1962,"SHIRNA: He won it, Doctor. "
1963,DOCTOR: He what? 
1964,VORG: It was during the Great Wallarian Exhibition. 
1965,"SHIRNA: You know what gamblers the Wallarians are. Well, Vorg had the"
1966,magum pod concession. 
1967,VORG: Surely you've seen it? I have three magum pods and a yorrow seed.
1968,"You know, the quickness of the hand deceives the eye. You put the"
1969,yorrow seed under the middle pod 
1970,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I have seen something similar. You say you won this"
1971,"machine? And you haven't the faintest idea how it works? I see. Well,"
1972,"look, this Wallarian that you got it from, did he by any chance give"
1973,you a green or a blue disc. A thing about this big? 
1974,"VORG: Oh, he gave me a lot of odds and ends. They're in my bag. I think"
1975,there is something like that. 
1976,"DOCTOR: Well go and have a look, will you? It's very important. "
1977,"SHIRNA: What's the idea, Doctor? "
1978,"DOCTOR: Well, it's simple, really. You see, the Scope's, er, omega"
1979,circuit is broken. Now if I can link it to the Tardis and use that as
1980,"the master, I can reprogramme the Scope. "
1981,SHIRNA: And what will that do? 
1982,"DOCTOR: Well, two things I hope. It'll enable me to get Jo out of here"
1983,"in time, and get her out of this wretched contraption, and it will"
1984,return all the other lifeforms to their original space time
1985,coordinates. 
1986,SHIRNA: So they'll all get back to where they came from. 
1987,"DOCTOR: I sincerely hope so, yes. "
1988,"VORG: Is this it? A bit mucky, I'm afraid. "
1989,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's it. Thank heavens you kept it. Look, come with me"
1990,"and I'll tell you what I want you to do. Er, would you mind just"
1991,waiting there for a moment?

2000,(The functionaries shuffle off.) 
2001,ORUM: The transporter must arrive shortly. 
2002,"KALIK: So, do you think my plan has failed? "
2003,"ORUM: Upon reflection, one is conscious of certain flaws. "
2004,KALIK: Indeed? 
2005,ORUM: One gathers the intention is the escape of these Drashigs in
2006,order to cause a disaster that will reflect badly upon President Zarb
2007,and his regime. 
2008,KALIK: Admirably put. 
2009,"ORUM: To this end, one has sabotaged the eradicator in order to leave"
2010,the city defenceless. 
2011,"KALIK: Precisely. The bigger the disaster, the better for us. "
2012,"ORUM: Yes, but is it not possible that one might oneself become part of"
2013,that disaster? 
2014,KALIK: There is a certain minimal risk. 
2015,"ORUM: One has no wish to be devoured by alien monstrosities, even in"
2016,the cause of political progress. 
2017,"KALIK: When the Drashigs burst from the machine, the city will be taken"
2018,"by surprise. We, on the other hand, will be ready to remove ourselves"
2019,from the area of danger. 
2020,"ORUM: One trusts the removal will be speedy. According to that Lurman,"
2021,the ferocity of the Drashigs is formidable! 
2022,"KALIK: No doubt he exaggerates. And in any case, I'm sure that as"
2023,commissioners of Inter Minor we shall prove to be more than a match for
2024,"these, er, primitive lifeforms. Have no fear, Orum. My plan will not"
2025,fail. 
2026,"ORUM: Well, it will if the Drashigs don't escape."
2027,
2028, [Space Port] 
2029, ORUM: And there's no sign of that. 
2030,KALIK: Shush.

2032,battering against a panel.) 
2033,KALIK: Isn't there? 
2034,ORUM: (sotto) They'll never break through those plates. They're
2035,molectic bonded disillum. 
2036,KALIK: (sotto) Then perhaps one had better give them a little help. 
2037,"(As Jo leaves Daly's cabin, the Doctor has brought a tangle of"

2041,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course it'll work. "

2044,"is the phase one switch here. And this is the phase two. Now, don't"
2045,touch the phase two until the last possible moment. Do you
2046,understand? 
2047,"VORG: I've got that. Phase one, phase two. Yes. "
2048,DOCTOR: Good. 
2049,PLETRAC: What are you doing? 
2050,SHIRNA: The Doctor's going back into the Scope. 
2051,PLETRAC: You will remain here. You came here illegally. Regulations
2052,demand that you be sent to the ICCA. 
2053,DOCTOR: What's the ICCA? 
2054,"VORG: The Inner Constellation Corrective Authority. You won't like it,"
2055,Doctor. 
2056,DOCTOR: Prison? 
2057,"PLETRAC: You are, by your own admission, a vagabond. "

2215,"DALY: You'll see for yourself tomorrow, Claire. Bombay! "
2216,CLAIRE: I'm looking forward to that. 
2217,DALY: Don't think young Andrews is though. 
2218,"CLAIRE: That's what I mean, you see. Romantic. Goodnight, Daddy. "
2219,"DALY: Goodnight, my child. Sleep well. "
2220,(Daly puts a line through 4th June 1926 on his calendar. So much for
2221,the greatest maritime mystery since the Marie Celeste - which was also
2222,a result of the Doctor's time travels if you remember!)
2223,
2224, [Space Port] 
2225, (The Doctor and Jo put the equipment back in the
2226,Tardis.) 
2227,"VORG: There was this second monster, barreling in at ninety degrees,"
2228,"practically breathing down my neck, and I swung like this, see, keeping"
2229,"low and I gave him a quick burst right in the vitals. Snap shot, it"
2230,was. 
2231,PLETRAC: We are all extremely grateful to you. Your valour will not be
2232,forgotten. 
2233,"VORG: Well, it's my natural reaction to stand and fight, you know. "
2234,PLETRAC: Our President will almost certainly wish to honour our Lurman
2235,guests for their courageous action. 
2236,VORG: Some form of decoration perhaps? 
2237,"SHIRNA: But how are we going to live? The Scope's had it, and we"
2238,haven't a credit bar to our name. 
2239,"VORG: You leave that to me, my dear. I say, Pletrac, old man, let me"
2240,show you a little trick. 
2241,"(Vorg touches Pletrac, who winces.) "
2242,"VORG: I'm so sorry. Now, I have here three magum pods and a yorrow"
2243,"seed. Right? Now, I place the yorrow seed under the middle pod, like"
2244,"so. Now, I move them very, very slowly. Now watch. "
2245,PLETRAC: Yes. 
2246,VORG: Watch carefully. Are you watching? You tell me which pod you
2247,think the seed is under. 
2248,PLETRAC: The middle one. 
2249,"VORG: The middle one? You wouldn't like to wager, say, a couple of"
2250,"credit bars on your judgement, would you? "
2251,PLETRAC: Certainly. One will wager two credit bars that the seed is
2252,under the middle pod. One can hardly discount the evidence of one's
2253,eyes. 
2254,(Vorg lifts the middle pod. Nothing there.) 
2255,"VORG: Oh, you're unlucky. "
2256,PLETRAC: One was obviously too hasty. One will not make the same
2257,mistake a second time. 
2258,VORG: Another little wager? 
2259,"PLETRAC: Five credit bars. No, ten! "
2260,"VORG: Whatever you say, Pletrac. Thank you. You know, I'm going to like"
2261,"it here. You remind me of the Wallarians, you know. They're great"
2262,"sportsmen, too. There we are. "
2263,DOCTOR: I don't think we need worry too much about our friend Vorg. 
2264,JO: He'll probably wind up President. 
2265,VORG: Watch carefully. 
2266,PLETRAC: One watches. 
2267,(The Doctor and Jo go into the Tardis.) 
2268,"VORG: I move them very, very slowly like that. Now keep watching. Now"
2269,you tell me which pod you think the seed is under. I'm giving you a
2270,chance to 
2271,(The Tardis dematerialises.)
