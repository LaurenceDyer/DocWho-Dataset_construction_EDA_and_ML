21,(The Tardis is in flight. Suddenly a fog horn
22,sounds and a ship's bow crashes through the side of the Tardis.) 
23,DOCTOR: What? What? 
24,"(A ship's bell sounds, and he picks up life belt that has the name"
25,Titanic on it.) 
26,DOCTOR: What? 
27,(The Doctor returns to the console and adjusts the controls. The Tardis
28,"walls reform, pushing the ship back outside. Then he materialises"
29,"inside the ship, next to a board detailing a list of shipping"
30,companies. The fog horn is sounding again.)

33,
34,(People in Edwardian dress are enjoying a champagne
35,buffet. A band plays a slow version of Jingle Bells. Around the room
36,are golden skinned statues of male angels. One moves as the Doctor
37,"walks past. Then he spots a small red-skinned alien in a dinner jacket,"
38,and goes to a window.) 
39,DOCTOR: Right. 
40,TANNOY: Attention all passengers. The Titanic is now in orbit above Sol
41,"Three, also known as Earth. Population, Human. Ladies and gentlemen,"
42,welcome to Christmas.
43,
44,[Bridge] 
45,(Captain Hardaker and his crew are also in
46,"Edwardian era uniforms, and the bridge is elegantly period, but the"
47,equipment is
48,"hi-tech. Are we in for Robots of Death meets Terminus, or a version of"
49,Douglas Adams' Starship Titanic?) 
50,"CAPTAIN: Nice and steady. Good work, Mister Cavill. And maintain"
51,"position. Now then, gentlemen, according to the traditions of the"
52,"planet below, Christmas is a time of celebration. I think you might be"
53,entitled to a tot of rum. Just the one. Off you go. I'll keep watch. 
54,CAVILL: Sir. 
55,"(The helmsman salutes and leaves, followed by others. Just the youngest"
56,officer remains.) 
57,CAPTAIN: And you. What was it? 
58,"FRAME: Midshipman Frame, sir. Only just qualified, sir. First trip out."
59,
60,"CAPTAIN: Then you can stand down, Midshipman. "
61,"FRAME: Er, but, er, regulations say the bridge has to be staffed by two"
62,"crewmembers at any one time, sir. "
63,"CAPTAIN: Well said. Very good. Well, it should be nice and quiet. It's"
64,only a level five planet down below. They don't even know we're here.
65,"Silent Night, I believe they call it. A silent night. "
66,[Reception]
67,
68,(A recording of a bald man with a thin moustache
69,sitting behind a desk.) 
70,"CAPRICORN [on screen]: Max Capricorn Cruiseliners. The fastest, the"
71,"farthest, the best. And I should know because my name is Max. "
72,(His gold tooth glints in the light. 
73,"The screen returns to the logo, and the lady singer croons Winter"
74,Wonderland. The Doctor has changed into dinner jacket and bow tie.) 
75,"STEWARD: Merry Christmas, sir. "
76,DOCTOR: Merry Christmas. 
77,"(Couples are dancing to the music. The Doctor mingles, passing a man on"
78,his mobile phone.) 
79,"SLADE: It's not a holiday for me, not while I've still got my vone. Now"
80,do as I say and sell. 
81,(The Doctor goes up to one of the angels.) 
82,DOCTOR: Evening. Passenger fifty seven. Terrible memory. Remind me. You
83,would be? 
84,HOST: Information. Heavenly Host supplying tourist information. 
85,"DOCTOR: Good, so, tell me, because I'm an idiot, where are we from? "
86,HOST: Information. The Titanic is en route from the planet Sto in the
87,Cassavalian Belt. The purpose of the cruise is to experience primitive
88,cultures. 
89,DOCTOR: Titanic. Who thought of the name? 
90,HOST: Information. It was chosen as the most famous vessel of the
91,planet Earth. 
92,DOCTOR: Did they tell you why it was famous? 
93,"HOST: Information. All designations are chosen by Mister Max Capricorn,"
94,"president of Max, Max, Max "
95,(The Host twitches and its voice pitch rises. The Steward notices and
96,hurries over.) 
97,"DOCTOR: Ooo, bit of a glitch. "
98,"STEWARD: It's all right, sir, we can handle this. "
99,(Two more officers arrive and they switch off the Host before carrying
100,it away.) 
101,"STEWARD: Software problem, that's all. Leave it with us, sir. Merry"
102,Christmas. That's another one down. What's going on with these
103,things?  
104,[Host maintenance room]
105,
106,STEWARD: That's eight of them now on the blink. One
107,"woman, she asked the Host to fix her necklace. It almost broke her"
108,neck. In First Class. 
109,ENGINEER: I've been over the robotics. Nothing. It's like something's
110,got into them. Some kind of bug. 
111,(Another Host is brought in on a forklift.) 
112,"ENGINEER: Whoa, wait, wait, wait. Over there. Bay fifteen. "
113,"STEWARD: Tell you what. If you can't fix them, throw them overboard. "
114,(The new broken Host watches him leave.)

117,
118,"(Slade bumps into the little waitress, making her"
119,drop her tray of drinks.) 
120,"SLADE: For Tov's sake, look where you're going. This jacket's a genuine"
121,Earth antique. 
122,"ASTRID: I'm sorry, sir. "
123,"(Yes, that is Kylie Minogue.) "
124,"SLADE: You'll be sorry when it comes off your wages, sweetheart."
125,Staffed by idiots. No wonder Max Capricorn's going down the drain. 
126,(Slade leaves. The Doctor stoops to help.) 
127,DOCTOR: Careful. There we go. 
128,"ASTRID: Thank you, sir. I can manage. "
129,"DOCTOR: I never said you couldn't. I'm the Doctor, by the way. "
130,"ASTRID: Astrid, sir. Astrid Peth. "
131,"DOCTOR: Nice to meet you, Astrid Peth. Merry Christmas. "
132,"ASTRID: Merry Christmas, sir. "
133,"DOCTOR: Just Doctor, not sir. "
134,ASTRID: You enjoying the cruise? 
135,"DOCTOR: Er, yeah, I suppose. I don't know. It doesn't quite work, a"
136,cruise on your own. 
137,ASTRID: You're not with anyone? 
138,"DOCTOR: No, no, just me. Just, er, used to be but, er, no. What about"
139,"you? Long way from home, Planet Sto. "
140,ASTRID: Doesn't feel that different. I spent three years working at the
141,"spaceport diner, travelled all the way here and I'm still waiting on"
142,tables. 
143,DOCTOR: No shore leave? 
144,ASTRID: We're not allowed. They can't afford the insurance. I just
145,"wanted to try it, just once. I used to watch the ships heading out to"
146,the stars and I always dreamt of. It sounds daft. 
147,"DOCTOR: You dreamt of another sky. New sun, new air, new life. A whole"
148,universe teeming with life. Why stand still when there're all that life
149,out there? 
150,"ASTRID: So, you travel a lot? "
151,"DOCTOR: All the time. Just for fun. Well, that's the plan. Never quite"
152,works. 
153,"ASTRID: Must be rich, though. "
154,DOCTOR: Haven't got a penny. Stowaway. 
155,ASTRID: Kidding. 
156,DOCTOR: Seriously. 
157,ASTRID: No. 
158,"DOCTOR: Oh, yeah. "
159,ASTRID: How did you get on board? 
160,"DOCTOR: Accident. I've got this, sort of, ship thing. I was just"
161,rebuilding her. Left the defences down. Bumped into the Titanic. Here I
162,"am. Bit of a party. I thought, why not? "
163,ASTRID: I should report you. 
164,DOCTOR: Go on then. 
165,ASTRID: I'll get you a drink on the house. 
166,"(Over at another table, a bunch of toffs are laughing at a large woman"
167,in a purple cowboy outfit and her equally well padded companion. The
168,Doctor joins them.) 
169,MORVIN: (the man) Just ignore them. 
170,DOCTOR: Something's tickled them. 
171,"FOON: (the woman) They told us it was fancy dress. Very funny, I'm"
172,sure. 
173,MORVIN: They're just picking on us because we haven't paid. We won our
174,tickets in a competition. 
175,FOON: I had to name the five husbands of Joofie Crystalle in By the
176,Light of the Asteroid. Did you ever watch By the Light of the Asteroid?
177,
178,DOCTOR: Is that the one with the twins? 
179,"FOON: That's it. Oh, it's marvellous. "
180,MORVIN: But we're not good enough for that lot. They think we should be
181,in steerage. 
182,"DOCTOR: Well, can't have that, can we? "
183,"(With his back towards the toffs, the Doctor aims his sonic screwdriver"
184,at the champagne bottle in the bucket on their table. The cork pops
185,"out, spraying their expensive clothes with alcohol.) "
186,FOON: Did you do that? 
187,DOCTOR: Maybe. 
188,FOON: We like you. 
189,"MORVIN: We do. I'm Morvin Van Hoff. This is my good woman, Foon. "
190,"DOCTOR: Foon. Hello, I'm the Doctor. "
191,"FOON: Oh, I'm going to need a Doctor, time I've finished with that"
192,"buffet. Have a buffalo wing. They must be enormous, these buffalo. So"
193,many wings. 
194,TANNOY: Attention please. Shore leave tickets Red Six Seven now
195,activated. Red Six Seven. 
196,FOON: Red Six Seven. That's us. Are you Red Six Seven? 
197,DOCTOR: Might as well be. 
198,"MORVIN: Come on, then. We're going to Earth."
199,
200,[Bridge]
201,
202,(A small alarm is beeping.) 
203,"FRAME: Seems to be power diverted to Deck thirty one, sir. It flared up"
204,then it stopped. 
205,"CAPTAIN: Nothing to worry about. She's an old ship, full of aches and"
206,pains. 
207,"FRAME: Picking up a meteoroid shower portside, bearing west fifty six"
208,north two. 
209,CAPTAIN: Pretty standard in this part of space. Miles away. 
210,"FRAME: We could probably see it, sir."
211,(Frame uses binoculars to look at three trails of flame in the vacuum
212,of space.) 
213,[Reception]
214,
215,(A man in a tweed suit is holding up a sign.) 
216,"COPPER: Red Six Seven. Red Six Seven. This way, fast as you can. "
217,ASTRID: I got you that drink. 
218,DOCTOR: And I got you a treat. Come on. 
219,COPPER: Red Six Seven departing shortly. 
220,(The Doctor shows him the psychic paper.) 
221,DOCTOR: Red Six Seven plus one. 
222,"COPPER: Quickly, sir, please, and take two teleport bracelets if you"
223,would. 
224,"(Very Blake's 7, another BBC sci fi hit.) "
225,ASTRID: I'll get the sack. 
226,DOCTOR: Brand new sky. 
227,"COPPER: To repeat, I am Mister Copper, the ship's historian, and I"
228,"shall be taking you to old London town in the country of UK, ruled over"
229,"by good King Wenceslas. Now, human beings worship the great god Santa,"
230,"a creature with fearsome claws, and his wife Mary. And every Christmas"
231,"Eve, the people of UK go to war with the country of Turkey. They then"
232,eat the Turkey people for Christmas dinner like savages. 
233,"DOCTOR: Excuse me. Sorry, sorry, but, er, where did you get all this"
234,from? 
235,"COPPER: Well, I have a first class degree in Earthonomics. Now, stand"
236,by. 
237,(The little red alien runs up.) 
238,BANNAKAFFALATTA: And me! And me! Red Six Seven. 
239,"COPPER: Well, take a bracelet, please, sir. "
240,"DOCTOR: But, er, hold on, hold on. What was your name? "
241,BANNAKAFFALATTA: Bannakaffalatta. 
242,"DOCTOR: Okay, Bannakaffalatta. But it's Christmas Eve down there. Late"
243,"night shopping, tons of people. He's like a talking conker. No offence,"
244,but you'll cause a riot because the streets are going to be packed with
245,shoppers and parties and
246,
247,[Street]
248,
249,(The group are teleported in mid word to an empty
250,shopping street.) 
251,DOCTOR: Oh. 
252,"COPPER: Now, spending money. I have a credit card in Earth currency if"
253,"you want to buy trinkets, or stockings, or the local delicacy, which is"
254,"known as beef. But don't stray too far, it could be dangerous. Any day"
255,now they start boxing. 
256,BANNAKAFFALATTA: Very good. 
257,DOCTOR: It should be full. It should be busy. Something's wrong. 
258,ASTRID: But it's beautiful. 
259,DOCTOR: Really? Do you think so? It's just a street. The pyramids are
260,"beautiful, and New Zealand. "
261,ASTRID: But it's a different planet. I'm standing on a different
262,planet. There's concrete and shops. Alien shops. Real alien shops!
263,"Look, no stars in the sky. And it smells. It stinks! Oh, this is"
264,amazing. Thank you! 
265,"DOCTOR: Yeah? Come on then, let's have a look. "
266,"(Next to the news stand is a billboard for The Examiner, headline -"
267,London Deserted. The proprietor has a Union Flag behind him. This is
268,"Bernard Cribbins, once a companion of the Peter Cushing Doctor.) "
269,"DOCTOR: Hello, there. Sorry, obvious question, but where's everybody"
270,gone? 
271,"WILF: Oh ho, scared! "
272,DOCTOR: Right. Yes. Scared of what? 
273,"WILF: Where've you been living? London at Christmas? Not safe, is it. "
274,DOCTOR: Why? 
275,"WILF: Well, it's them, up above. Look, Christmas before last we had"
276,"that big bloody spaceship, everyone standing on a roof. And then last"
277,"year, that Christmas Star electrocuting all over the place, draining"
278,the Thames. 
279,ASTRID: This place is amazing. 
280,"WILF: And this year, Lord knows what. So, everybody's scarpered. Gone"
281,to the country. All except me and Her Majesty. 
282,NICHOLAS WITCHELL [on TV]: Her Majesty the Queen has confirmed that
283,she'll be staying in Buckingham Palace throughout the festive season to
284,"show the people of London, and the world, that there's nothing to fear."
285,
286,WILF: God bless her. We stand vigil. 
287,"DOCTOR: Well, between you and me, I think her Majesty's got it right."
288,"Far as I know, this year, nothing to worry about. "
289,(The Doctor and Astrid vanish.) 
290,WILF: Then again.
291,
292,[Reception]
293,
294,DOCTOR: I was in mid-sentence. 
295,"COPPER: Yes, I'm sorry about that. A bit of a problem. If I could have"
296,your bracelets. 
297,"STEWARD: Apologies, ladies and gentlemen, and Bannakaffalatta. We seem"
298,to have suffered a slight power fluctuation. If you'd like to return to
299,"the festivities. And on behalf of Max Capricorn Cruiseliners, free"
300,drinks will be provided. 
301,FOON: Thank you. 
302,ASTRID: That was the best. The best! 
303,DOCTOR: What sort of power fluctuation?
304,
305,[Bridge]
306,
307,(Frame watches the improbably burning objects turn
308,towards the Titanic.) 
309,"FRAME: That's a bit odd, sir. The meteoroids are changing course."
310,"Still, we can put the shields up to maximum, just in case. "
311,"CAPTAIN: As you were, Midshipman. "
312,"FRAME: Sir? You're magnetising the hull, sir. It's drawing the meteors"
313,in. 
314,COMPUTER: Port turning Earthside. 
315,FRAME: I take it that's deliberate. 
316,COMPUTER: Port turning Earthside. 
317,FRAME: Bit of a light show for the guests. 
318,CAPTAIN: Something like that. 
319,[Reception]
320,
321,"(The singer is crooning 'The Stowaway', by Murray"
322,Gold.) 
323,SINGER: You shouldn't be here. What's your tale? I ought to throw you
324,"to the whale. He just smiled and said, come here, let's dance. He said,"
325,"borrow or steal, I'll find a way to be with my lover upon Christmas"
326,"Day. And I'll run and I'll roam, I'll cover the ground. This Christmas"
327,I'll see you. I'll be around. 
328,CAPRICORN [in picture frame]: And I should know because my name is Max.
329,"The fastest, the furthest, the best. My name is Max. "
330,(The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver to unfasten the frame and get at
331,the electronics behind it. He changes the image to ship's status. The
332,shields are off-line. The Doctor looks out of the nearby porthole to
333,see the three fireballs heading their way.)
334,
335,[Bridge]
336,
337,(The speaking tube whistles.) 
338,DOCTOR : Is that the bridge? I need to talk to the Captain. You've
339,got a meteoroid storm coming in 
340,[Reception]
341,
342,DOCTOR: West zero by north two.
343,
344,[Bridge]
345,
346,CAPTAIN: Who is this?
347,
348,[Reception]
349,
350,"DOCTOR: Never mind that, your shields are down."
351,"Check your scanners, Captain. You've got meteoroids coming in and now"
352,shielding.
353,
354,[Bridge]
355,
356,CAPTAIN: You have no authorisation. You will clear
357,the comms at once.
358,
359,[Reception]
360,
361,DOCTOR: Yeah? Just look starboard! 
362,"STEWARD: Come with me, sir."
363,
364,[Bridge]
365,
366,"FRAME: But he's right, sir. The shields have been"
367,taken offline. 
368,CAPTAIN: Step away from there. 
369,FRAME: But we have to re energise them. 
370,"CAPTAIN: I said step away, Midshipman. "
371,(The Captain points a revolver at Frame.)
372,
373,[Reception]
374,
375,(The Doctor is being escorted off deck.) 
376,DOCTOR: You've got a rock storm heading for this ship and the shields
377,are down.
378,
379,[Bridge]
380,
381,CAPTAIN: They promised me old men. 
382,"FRAME: I'm sorry, sir? "
383,CAPTAIN: On the crew. Sea dogs. Men who'd had their time. Not boys.
384,
385,[Reception]
386,
387,(The Doctor gets away from his escort.) 
388,"SINGER: Be with my lover on next Christmas Day, and I'll run and I'll"
389,"roam, I'll cover the ground. "
390,(The Doctor takes the microphone stand from the singer.) 
391,"DOCTOR: Everyone, listen to me! This is an emergency! Get to the lifeb "
392,(A Host puts its hand over the Doctor's mouth.)
393,
394,[Bridge]
395,
396,"FRAME: I'm sorry, sir. It's my duty! "
397,"(Frame reaches for the controls, and the Captain shoots him.) "
398,[Reception]
399,
400,DOCTOR: Look out the windows! 
401,(The Doctor is taken away.) 
402,BANNAKAFFALATTA: Him friend. 
403,(Slade sees the meteoroids.) 
404,"DOCTOR: If you don't believe me, check the shields yourself. "
405,"ASTRID: Sir, I can vouch for him! "
406,"MORVIN: Look, Steward, he's just had a bit too much to drink. "
407,"COPPER: Sir, something seems to have gone wrong. All the teleports have"
408,gone down. 
409,STEWARD: Not now! 
410,(A piece of hot rock breaks through a window and lands at Slade's
411,feet.) 
412,COMPUTER: Oxygen membrane holding. Oxygen membrane holding. 
413,(Slade goes to a nearby Host.) 
414,SLADE: You there. Has anyone checked the external shielding? 
415,HOST: Information. You are all going to die. 
416,"(On the bridge, the Captain is at the wheel whilst Frame is lying on"
417,"the floor, bleeding from a wound to his upper right chest.) "
418,SLADE: Where's the Chief Steward? 
419,"OFFICER: Er, he went that way, sir. "
420,[Corridor]
421,
422,DOCTOR: The shields are down. We are going to get
423,hit. 
424,[Bridge]
425,
426,FRAME: You're going to kill us. 
427,CAPTAIN: I'm dying already. Six months. And they offered me so much
428,money for my family.
429,
430,[Corridor]
431,
432,"SLADE: Oi! Steward! I'm telling you, the shields"
433,are down! 
434,DOCTOR: Listen to him. Listen to him!

436,
437,CAPRICORN [on screen]: Max Capricorn. 
438,"WOMAN: Darling, come and have a look at this. "
439,CAPRICORN [on screen]: Fastest 
440,COMPUTER: Red Alert. Red Alert. 
441,MAN: Cheers. 
442,CAPRICORN [on screen]: The furthest. The best. 
443,"(The first fireball impacts the Titanic dead centre. Fires, panic.) "

455,"(An explosion sends the Doctor and Astrid flying,"
456,"then everything goes quiet, apart from people whimpering.) "
457,"MORVIN: It's all right, sweetheart. "
458,DOCTOR: Shush. It's stopping. 
459,(There are three large holes in the hull.) 
460,DOCTOR: You all right? 
461,ASTRID: I think so. 
462,DOCTOR: Bad name for a ship. Either that or this suit is really
463,unlucky. 
464,CAPRICORN : My name is Max. My name is Max. My name is Max. 
465,"STEWARD: Er, everyone. Ladies and gentlemen, Bannakaffalatta. I must"
466,apologise on behalf of Max Capricorn Cruiseliners. We seem to have had
467,a small collision. 
468,MORVIN: Small? 
469,SLADE: Do you know how much I paid for my ticket? 
470,"STEWARD: If I could have silence, ladies, gentlemen. Please. Quiet!"
471,Thank you. I'm sure Max Capricorn Cruiseliners will be able to
472,"reimburse you for any inconvenience, but first I would point out that"
473,we're very much alive. 
474,ASTRID: Doctor. 
475,(Mister Copper has a cut on his head.) 
476,DOCTOR: Are you all right? 
477,"STEWARD: She is, after all, a fine, sturdy ship. If you could all stay"
478,here while I ascertain the exact nature of the situation. 
479,(The Chief Steward goes to a nearby hatch.) 
480,DOCTOR: Don't open it! 
481,(Too late. The Chief Steward is sucked out into space. Everybody hangs
482,onto the nearest fixed object while the Doctor sonics a control panel
483,that is flashing Vacuum Breach. It changes to Oxygen Shield.) 
484,COMPUTER: Oxygen shield stabilised.

488,BANNAKAFFALATTA: Yes. 
489,"DOCTOR: You, what was your name? "
490,SLADE: Rickston Slade. 
491,DOCTOR: You all right? 
492,SLADE: No thanks to that idiot. 
493,ASTRID: The steward just died. 
494,SLADE: Then he's a dead idiot. 
495,"DOCTOR: All right, calm down. Just stay still, all of you. Hold on. "
496,ASTRID: What happened? How come the shields were down? 
497,DOCTOR: I don't think it was an accident. 
498,(They look out of the hatchway and the hole in the side of the ship to
499,the floating debris and bodies.) 
500,ASTRID: How many dead? 
501,"DOCTOR: We're alive. Just focus on that. I will get you out of here,"
502,"Astrid, I promise. Look at me. I promise. Good. Now, if we can get to"
503,"Reception, I've got a spaceship tucked away. We can all get on board"
504,and. Oh. 
505,ASTRID: What is it? What's wrong? 
506,DOCTOR: That's my ship over there. 
507,ASTRID: Where? 
508,DOCTOR: There. That box. That little blue box. 
509,ASTRID: That's a spaceship? 
510,"DOCTOR: Oi, don't knock it. "
511,ASTRID: It's a bit small. 
512,"DOCTOR: A bit distant. Trouble is, once it's set adrift, it's"
513,"programmed to lock onto the nearest centre of gravity, and that would"
514,be the Earth.

625,DOCTOR: Careful. Follow me. 
626,"COPPER: Rather ironic, but this is very much in the spirit of"
627,Christmas. It's a festival of violence. They say that human beings only
628,survive depending on whether they've been good or bad. It's barbaric. 
629,"DOCTOR: Actually, that's not true. Christmas is a time of, of peace and"

638,(The Doctor leads the rest of them further up.) 
639,ASTRID: It's blocked.

641,ASTRID: We shift it. 
642,"DOCTOR: That's the attitude. Rickston, Mister Copper, and you,"
643,"Bannakaffalatta. Look, can I just call you Banna? It's"
644,going to save a lot of time. 
645,BANNAKAFFALATTA: No. Bannakaffalatta. 
646,"DOCTOR: All right then, Bannakaffalatta. There's a gap in the middle."
647,See if you can get through. 
648,BANNAKAFFALATTA: Easy. Good. 
649,(The ship shakes and more debris shifts.) 
650,SLADE: This whole thing could come crashing down any minute.

652,SLADE: No. What message? 
653,DOCTOR: Shut up! 
654,BANNAKAFFALATTA: Bannakaffalatta made it. 
655,"ASTRID: I'm small enough, I can get through. "

657,ASTRID: I'm fine.

662,"MORVIN: Hey, hey. Come on, sweetheart. Don't listen to him. "
663,"FOON: No, but it's all my fault, though. The tickets. "
664,MORVIN: We won them fair and square. 
665,FOON: I know. I never told you. I dialed the competition line five
666,thousand times. That's five thousand credits. I might as well have paid
667,for the tickets. I've been hiding the vone bill for months now. 
668,MORVIN: Five thousand credits? You spent five thousand credits? 
669,FOON: Don't hate me. 
670,(Morvin laughs.) 
671,FOON: What's so funny? 
672,MORVIN: Five thousand? 
673,FOON: We'll never pay that off. 
674,"MORVIN: I know. I'll have to work twenty years, you mad, bloody woman. "

676,MORVIN: Does it matter? Look at us. You drive me barmy. I don't half
677,"love you, Mrs Van Hoff. Come here. "
678,SLADE: What happened? Did they find a doughnut? 
679,ASTRID: I can clear it from this side. Just tell me if it starts
680,"moving. Bannakaffalatta, what's wrong? "
681,BANNAKAFFALATTA: Shush.

683,BANNAKAFFALATTA: Can't say.

689,ASTRID: You're a cyborg. 
690,BANNAKAFFALATTA: Had accident long ago. Secret. 
691,"ASTRID: No, but everything's changed now. Cyborgs are getting equal"
692,rights. They passed a law back on Sto. You can even get married.

891,"ASTRID: This Christmas thing, what's it all about? "
892,"DOCTOR: Long story. I should know, I was there. I got the last room. "
893,"COPPER: But if the planet's waking up, can't we signal them? They could"
894,send up a rocket or something. 
895,DOCTOR: They don't have spaceships. 
896,"COPPER: No, I read about it. They have shuffles. Space shuffles. "

900,COPPER: Mrs Golightly's Happy Travelling University and Dry Cleaners. 
901,"ASTRID: You, you lied to the company to get the job? "
902,"COPPER: I wasted my life on Sto. I was a travelling salesman, always on"
903,"the road, and I reached retirement with nothing to show for it. Not"
904,even a home. And Earth sounded so exotic. 
905,"DOCTOR: Hmm. I suppose it is, yeah. "
906,ASTRID: How come you know it so well? 
907,"DOCTOR: I was sort of, a few years ago, I was sort of made, well, sort"
908,"of homeless, and, er, there was the Earth. "
909,"COPPER: The thing is, if we survive this, there'll be police and all"
910,sorts of investigations. Now the minimum penalty for space lane fraud
911,is ten years in jail. I'm an old man. I won't survive ten years.

951,SLADE: I'm okay.

969,SLADE: Doctor? The door's locked! 
970,"DOCTOR: Just think. What would he want, eh? "
971,FOON: He don't want nothing. He's dead. 
972,"SLADE: Doctor, I can't open the door. We need the whirling key thing of"
973,yours.

1021,COPPER: It's the EMP transmitter. He'd want us to use it. I used to
1022,sell these things. They'd always give me a bed for the night in the
1023,"cyborg caravans. They're good people. But if we can recharge it, we can"
1024,use it as a weapon against the rest of the Host. Bannakaffalatta might

1074,ASTRID: You're talking as if you're not coming with us. 
1075,DOCTOR: There's something down on deck thirty one. I'm going to find

1077,ASTRID: What if you meet a Host? 
1078,"DOCTOR: Well, then I'll just have some fun. "
1079,ASTRID: Sounds like you do this kind of thing all the time. 
1080,DOCTOR: Not by choice. All I do is travel. That's what I am. Just a
1081,"traveller. Imagine it. No tax, no bills, no boss. Just the open sky. "
1082,ASTRID: I'm sort of unemployed now. I was thinking the blue box is kind
1083,"of small, but I could squeeze in it, like a stowaway. "
1084,DOCTOR: It's not always safe. 
1085,ASTRID: So you need someone to take care of you. I've got no one back
1086,"on Sto. No family, just me. So what do you think? Can I come with you? "

1138,"question left. One question. So, you've been given orders to kill the"
1139,"survivors but survivors must therefore be passengers or staff, but not"
1140,"me. I'm not a passenger. I'm not staff. Go on, scan me. You must have"
1141,"bio-records. No such person on board. I don't exist, therefore you"
1142,"can't kill me. Therefore, I'm a stowaway, and stowaways should be"
1143,arrested and taken to the nearest figure of authority. And I reckon the
1144,nearest figure of authority is on deck thirty one. Final question. Am I

1428,"COPPER: You know, between you and me, I don't even thing this snow is"

1443,"DOCTOR: Mister Copper, a million pounds is worth fifty million credits."
