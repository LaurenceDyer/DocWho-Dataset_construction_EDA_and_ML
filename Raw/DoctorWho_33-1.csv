22,(The Doctor is enjoying tea and a biscuit
23,in a tea room when he sees a cloaked figure with no visible face
24,sitting across the
25,room. No one else notices. Then it is sitting opposite him.) 
26,DOCTOR: I don't think I asked you to sit. 
27,FIGURE: There is a woman who wants to meet you. 
28,"DOCTOR: That's nice, but I'm married. "
29,FIGURE: Your help is required. 
30,DOCTOR: I don't discuss my business in public. 
31,FIGURE: I know. 
32,"(A wave of the hand, and they are the only people in the tea room.) "
33,DOCTOR: Who are you? 
34,FIGURE: A messenger. 
35,DOCTOR: Whose messenger? 
36,FIGURE: Darla von Karlsen. 
37,DOCTOR: Never heard of her. 
38,(He stands up. The location has changed.) 
39,DOCTOR: Where's the tea room? 
40,FIGURE: You were never in the tea room. 
41,DOCTOR: Oh. Of course. Psychic projection. Someone's sending me a dream
42,"message. Well, I hope I fell asleep somewhere comfy. "
43,FIGURE: Do you recognise where you are? 
44,(Children's laughter off.) 
45,DOCTOR: Can't remember. How do you hang up on this thing? 
46,FIGURE: You can't. 
47,DOCTOR: Oh yeah? And what if I just wake up? 
48,(In a deckchair on a beach.) 
49,"FIGURE: No, Doctor. The beach isn't real either. You are still"
50,dreaming. 
51,(In space.) 
52,FIGURE: Spacetime coordinates. You will meet Darla von Karlsen here.
53,"Her daughter is in danger, and only you can save her. You recognise the"
54,planet? 
55,DOCTOR: Yes. 
56,FIGURE: Say it. 
57,DOCTOR: No. 
58,FIGURE: Name the planet. 
59,DOCTOR: I will not say that name. 
60,FIGURE: Say it. 
61,DOCTOR: No! 
62,(The Doctor wakes up underneath the time rotor.) 
63,FIGURE : Name the planet. Name the planet. Name the planet. 
64,DOCTOR: Skaro. 
65,
66, [Skaro] 
67, (A scene of utter devastation and persisting
68,rainfall. We pan around a giant Dalek statue covered in mould and
69,mess.) 
70,"DARLA : First, there were the Daleks. And then, there was a man who"
71,"fought them. And then, in time, he died. There are a few, of course,"
72,"who believe this man somehow survived, and that one day he will return."
73,"For both our sakes, dearest Hannah, we must hope these stories are"
74,true. 
75,(A robed figure wearing high heels turns to a shadow with the profile
76,of the Doctor walking inside the eyepiece of the statue.) 
77,DOCTOR: I got your message. Not many people can do that. Send me
78,messages. 
79,"DARLA: I have a daughter, Hannah. She's in a Dalek prison camp. They"
80,say you can help. 
81,DOCTOR: Do they? I wish they'd stop. I love your choice of meeting
82,place. 
83,DARLA: They said I'd have to intrigue you. 
84,DOCTOR: Skaro. The original planet of the Daleks. Look at the state of
85,it. Who told you about me? 
86,DARLA: Does it matter? 
87,"DOCTOR: Maybe not, but you're very well informed. If Hannah's in a"
88,"Dalek prison camp, tell me, why aren't you? "
89,DARLA: I escaped. 
90,DOCTOR: (chuckles) No. Nobody escapes the Dalek camps. You're very
91,cold. 
92,DARLA: What's wrong? 
93,DOCTOR: It's a trap. 
94,DARLA: What is? 
95,"DOCTOR: You are, and you don't even know it. "
96,"(The Doctor backs away as a Dalek eyepiece comes out of her forehead,"
97,"then a gun out of her right palm. He is shot, and a Dalek saucer"
98,appears in the sky.) 
99,DALEK : The Doctor is acquired. 
100, [Photoshoot] 
101, (Amy is modelling for the cameras in a stately
102,home when the Personal Assistant gestures to her.) 
103,AMY: I'll just be a minute. 
104,PA: Your husband is here. 
105,AMY: Hmm. I don't have a husband. 
106,"PA: Oh, well, apparently you still do. "
107, [Dressing room] 
108, RORY: You have to sign these. 
109,AMY: And then we're not married? 
110,RORY: Just like magic. 
111,(Amy signs.) 
112,AMY: Can't chat. Working. 
113,RORY: Really? Thought you were just pouting at a camera. 
114,AMY: Rory? 
115,(Rory leaves and Cassandra the make-up artist enters. One of the bulbs
116,on the make up dresser is flashing.) 
117,"CASSANDRA: Sorry, love. Was I interrupting? "
118,AMY: No. 
119,"CASSANDRA: Gosh, look at you. You've gone so pale. Come on, take a"
120,seat. We'll soon sort that out. 
121,(But Cassandra sprouts a Dalek eyepiece instead.) 
122,DALEK : Amelia Pond is acquired. 
123, [Bus] 
124, (Rory gets on board.) 
125,RORY: Cheers. 
126,"(He sit down. The bus driver stares at him in his mirror, then a Dalek"
127,eyepiece grows from his forehead. The bus is filled with white light.) 
128,DALEK : Rory Williams is acquired. 
129, [White room] 
130, (Rory wakes up on the floor of a circular room.
131,Amy is standing nearby.) 
132,RORY: Where are we? 
133,(He gets up and looks out of the small window. There is a fleet of
134,Dalek saucers outside.) 
135,RORY: So how much trouble are we in? 
136,(The door opens and a Dalek enters.) 
137,"DOCTOR : How much trouble, Mister Pond? "
138,"(The Doctor enters, under escort.) "
139,DOCTOR: Out of ten? Eleven. 
140,"(The ceiling opens and the floor rises, lifting them into -) "
141, [Parliament] 
142, (A large domed area with a multitude of Daleks in
143,"tiers around them, and the White Supreme Dalek nearby, along with an"
144,organic Dalek and the Tardis.) 
145,"AMY: Where are we? A spaceship, right? "
146,DOCTOR: Not just any spaceship. The Parliament of the Daleks. Be brave.
147,
148,AMY: What do we do? 
149,"DOCTOR: Make them remember you. Well, come on then. You've got me. What"
150,"are you waiting for? At long last, it's Christmas! Here I am. "
151,"(The Doctor closes his eyes tight, expecting to die. The organic Dalek"
152,speaks.) 
153,DALEK PM: Save us. You will save us. 
154,DOCTOR: I'll what? 
155,DALEK: You will save the Daleks. 
156,DALEKS: Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the
157,Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. 
158,DOCTOR: Well. 
159,DALEKS: Save the Daleks. 
160,DOCTOR: This is new. 
161, [Room] 
162, (A musical box plays Carmen as a young brunette
163,nails planks over the round window. It is a neat room with a hammock
164,and a microwave.) 
165,"OSWIN : Day three six three. The terror continues. Also, made"
166,"another soufflé, very nearly. Check defences. They came again last"
167,"night. Still always at night. Maybe they're vampires. Oh, and it's my"
168,"mum's birthday. Happy birthday, mum. "
169,"OSWIN: I did make you a soufflé, but it was too beautiful to live. "
170,DALEK : You will let us enter! We will enter! We will enter! 
171,(She turns up the volume on Carmen. Toreador blasts out.) 
172, [Parliament] 
173, RORY: What's he doing? 
174,"AMY: He's chosen the most defendable area in the room, counted all the"
175,"Daleks, counted all the exits, and now he's calculating the exact"
176,"distance we're standing apart and starting to worry. Oh, and look at"
177,him frowning now. 
178,(Dalek Darla is there.) 
179,"AMY: Something's wrong with Amy and Rory, and who's going to fix it?"
180,And he straightens his bow tie. 
181,DALEK PM: We have arrived. 
182,DOCTOR: Arrived where? 
183,DALEK PM: Doctor. 
184,DARLA: The Prime Minister will speak with you now. 
185,DOCTOR: Do you remember who you were before they emptied you out and
186,turned you into their puppet? 
187,DARLA: My memories are only reactivated if they are required to
188,facilitate cover or disguise. 
189,DOCTOR: You had a daughter. 
190,DARLA: I know. I've read my file. 
191,"(The Doctor walks up to the Prime Minister, who is the organic Dalek.) "
192,DOCTOR: Well? 
193,DALEK PM: What do you know of the Dalek Asylum? 
194,"DOCTOR: According to legend, you have a dumping ground. A planet where"
195,"you lock up all the Daleks that go wrong. The battle-scarred, the"
196,"insane, the ones even you can't control. It's never made any sense to"
197,me. 
198,DALEK PM: Why not? 
199,DOCTOR: Because you'd just kill them. 
200,DALEK PM: It is offensive to us to extinguish such divine hatred. 
201,DOCTOR: Offensive? 
202,DALEK PM: Does it surprise you to know the Daleks have a concept of
203,beauty? 
204,DOCTOR: I thought you'd run out of ways to make me sick. Hello again.
205,You think hatred is beautiful. 
206,DALEK PM: Perhaps that is why we have never been able to kill you. 
207,(A hole opens in the middle of the floor. The Doctor and Darla walk
208,back to it. A planet is visible.) 
209,"DARLA: The Asylum. It occupies the entire planet, right to the core. "
210,DOCTOR: How many Daleks are in there? 
211,"DARLA: A count has not been made. Millions, certainly. "
212,DOCTOR: All still alive? 
213,DARLA: It has to be assumed. The Asylum is fully automated. Supervision
214,is not required. 
215,AMY: Armed? 
216,DARLA: The Daleks are always armed. 
217,"RORY: What colour? I'm sorry, there weren't any good questions left. "
218,DARLA: This signal is being received from the very heart of the Asylum.
219,
220,(Carmen comes over the speakers.) 
221,WHITE: What is the noise? Explain. Explain. 
222,"DOCTOR: Er, it's me. "
223,"RORY: Sorry, what? "
224,"DOCTOR: It's me, playing the triangle. Okay, I got buried in the mix."
225,Carmen. Lovely show. Someone's transmitting this. Have you considered
226,tracking back the signal and talking to them? He asked the Daleks. 
227, [Room] 
228, DOCTOR : Hello? Hello? Carmen 
229, [Parliament] 
230, DOCTOR: Hello? 
231, [Room] 
232, OSWIN: Hello? 
233,DOCTOR : Come in. Come in. 
234, [Parliament] 
235," DOCTOR: Come in, Carmen. "
236, [Room] 
237," OSWIN: Hello! Yes, yes, sorry. Do you read me? "
238, [Parliament] 
239," DOCTOR: Yes, reading you loud and clear. Identify "
240, [Room] 
241, DOCTOR : Yourself and report your status. 
242,"OSWIN: Hello. Are you real? Are you actually, properly, real? "
243, [Parliament] 
244," DOCTOR: Yes, confirmed. Actually, properly, real. "
245,"OSWIN : Oswin Oswald, junior entertainment officer, starship "
246, [Room] 
247," OSWIN: Alaska. Current status, crashed and"
248,"shipwrecked somewhere not nice. Been here a year, rest of the crew"
249,missing. Provisions good but keen to move on. 
250, [Parliament] 
251, DOCTOR: A year? Are you okay? Are you under
252,attack? 
253,OSWIN : Some local lifeforms. 
254, [Room] 
255, OSWIN: Been keeping them out. 
256,DOCTOR : Do you know what those lifeforms are? 
257,"OSWIN: I know a Dalek when I hear one, yeah. "
258, [Parliament] 
259, DOCTOR: What have you been doing on your own
260,against the Daleks for a year? 
261, [Room] 
262, OSWIN: Making soufflés? 
263, [Parliament] 
264, DOCTOR: Soufflés? Against the Daleks? Where'd you
265,get the milk? 
266,WHITE: This conversation is irrelevant. 
267,"DOCTOR: No, it isn't. "
268, [Room] 
269, OSWIN: No! Hello? Hello? 
270, [Parliament] 
271, DOCTOR: Because a starliner has crashed into your
272,"Asylum, and someone's got in. And if someone can get in, then"
273,everything can get out. A tsunami of insane Daleks. Even you don't want
274,that. 
275,WHITE: The Asylum must be cleansed. 
276,DOCTOR: Then why is it still here? You've enough firepower on this ship
277,to blast it out of the sky. 
278,DARLA: The Asylum forcefield is impenetrable. 
279,DOCTOR: Turn it off. 
280,DARLA: It can only be turned off from within the Asylum. 
281,DOCTOR: A small taskforce could sneak through a forcefield. Send in a
282,"couple of Daleks. Oh. (applauds) Oh. Oh, that's good. That's brilliant."
283,"You're all too scared to go down there. Not one of you will go, so tell"
284,"me, what do the Daleks do when they're too scared? "
285,WHITE: The Predator of the Daleks will be deployed. 
286,"DOCTOR: You don't have a Predator, and even if you did, why would they"
287,turn off a forcefield for you? 
288,DALEK PM: Because you will have no other means of escape. 
289,DARLA: May I clarify? The Predator is the Dalek's word for you. 
290,DOCTOR: Me? Me? 
291,DARLA: You will need this. It will protect you from the nanocloud. 
292,(Two humanoids put a wristband on the Doctor's wrist.) 
293,DOCTOR: The what? The nano what? 
294,DARLA: The gravity beam will convey you close to the source of the
295,transmission. You must find a way to deactivate the forcefield from
296,there. 
297,DOCTOR: You're going to fire me at a planet? That's your plan? I get
298,fired at a planet and expected to fix it. 
299,"RORY: In fairness, that is slightly your M O. "
300,DOCTOR: Don't be fair to the Daleks when they're firing me at a planet.
301,
302,"(Rory and Amy have wristbands put on them, too.) "
303,DOCTOR: What do you want with them? 
304,WHITE: It is known the Doctor required companions. 
305,"RORY: Oh, brilliant. Good oh. "
306,"DOCTOR: Don't worry. We'll get through this, I promise. Don't be"
307,scared. 
308,(Amy's Look could melt granite.) 
309,AMY: Scared? Who's scared. Geronimo. 
310,DOCTOR: Ha! Oi! 
311,(The humanoids push our trio into the gravity beam.) 
312, [Gravity beam] 
313, ALL: Argh! 
314,RORY: Wrong way up! Wrong way up! 
315,"(Rory plummets past the Doctor and Amy, head first.) "
316,AMY: Doctor! 
317,(The beam splits into three.) 
318, [Snowfield] 
319, (Amy lands on a snowy landscape with a brilliant
320,blue sky. A black man in white thermals drops his drill - labelled
321,Alaska - and runs to them.) 
322,HARVEY: Hello? Hello? Who are you? You okay? 
323,AMY: Rory? Doctor? 
324,HARVEY: I'm Harvey. No. Who's Rory? 
325,(Harvey chases after Amy.) 
326,HARVEY: Where are you going? 
327,"(Over the ridge, a series of eyepieces pop up and down from under the"
328,snow to look at the Doctor.) 
329,"DOCTOR: Oh, ha, ha, ha. "
330,(Then Carmen plays.) 
331,"OSWIN [OC}: Sorry, sorry. Pressed the wrong switch. "
332,DOCTOR: Soufflé girl? 
333, [Room] 
334," OSWIN: You can always call me Oswin, seeing as"
335,that's my name. You okay? 
336,"DOCTOR [on screen]: How are you doing that, eh? This is Dalek"
337,technology. 
338,OSWIN: It's very easy to hack. 
339,"DOCTOR [on screen]: No, it isn't. Where are you? "
340,"OSWIN: The ship broke up when it hit. Somewhere underground, I think."
341,You coming to get me? 
342,AMY : Doctor? 
343,(The picture starts to break up.) 
344,DOCTOR [on screen]: Hey! Oi! Soufflé girl! 
345,OSWIN: Damn. 
346,DOCTOR : Come back! 
347, [Snowfield] 
348, AMY: Doctor! 
349,"DOCTOR: Amy! Hey, where's Rory? "
350,HARVEY: There was another beam. There. Over there. Are you the rescue
351,team? 
352,(They run across the snow.) 
353, [Room] 
354, OSWIN: Hello? 
355, [Snowfield] 
356, (A shaft has been drilled through the snow and
357,rock.) 
358,AMY: Rory? Rory! Rory! 
359, [Chamber] 
360," (Meltwater pours down the walls, and something"
361,"green drips onto Rory's face, waking him up. There are lots of"
362,"inanimate Daleks here. He touches one, but it doesn't respond so he"
363,pushes it away.) 
364, [Snowfield] 
365, HARVEY: We came down two days ago. There's twelve
366,of our escape pods. I don't know what happened to them. 
367,AMY: Alaska? That's the same ship as soufflé girl. 
368,(Harvey opens a hatch covered in snow.) 
369,DOCTOR: Yeah. Except she's been here a year. 
370, [Escape pod] 
371, HARVEY: We should have some climbing rope long
372,enough for that hole. 
373,DOCTOR: Won't you introduce us to your crew? 
374,"HARVEY: Ah, yes, sorry. Guys, this is the Doctor and Amy. "
375,(No response.) 
376,HARVEY: Guys? 
377,(The crew are desiccated corpses.) 
378,"HARVEY: Oh, my god. "
379,(The Doctor does a quick sonic scan.) 
380,DOCTOR: They're dead. All of them. 
381,HARVEY: That's not possible. I just spoke to them. Two hours ago. We
382,were doing engine repairs. 
383,"DOCTOR: You're sure about that, are you? Because I'd say they've all"
384,been dead for a very long time. 
385,HARVEY: But they can't have been. 
386,"AMY: Well, they didn't get in this state in two hours. "
387,"HARVEY: No, of course. Stupid me. "
388,AMY: Of course what? 
389,"HARVEY: I died outside, and the cold preserved my body. I forgot about"
390,dying. 
391,(Out pops the Dalek eyepiece. The Doctor grabs a CO2 fire extinguisher
392,and lets it off in Harvey's face.) 
393,"DOCTOR: Amy, the door! "
394,"AMY: Come on, come on. "
395,"(Harvey is backed through a door that Amy manages to get open, then"
396,closes and locks again.) 
397,AMY: Explain. That's what you're good at. How'd he get all Daleked? 
398,"DOCTOR: Because he wasn't wearing one of these. Oh, ho, ho. That's"
399,clever. The nanocloud. Microorganisms that automatically process any
400,"organic matter, living or dead, into a Dalek puppet. Anything attacks"
401,"this place, it automatically becomes part of the on-site security. "
402,AMY: Living or dead? 
403,DOCTOR: These wristbands protect us. The only thing stopping us going
404,exactly the way he did 
405,"AMY: Doctor, shut up! Living or dead? "
406,"DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Living or, or "
407,"(The corpses have glowing eyepieces, and are starting to move.) "
408,DOCTOR: Dead. Oh dear. 
409,(The Doctor kicks the zombies so he and Amy can get into the -) 
410, [Cockpit] 
411, (He pulls Amy's arm out of the zombie's grasp and
412,seals the bulkhead door.) 
413,AMY: Is it bad that I've really missed this? 
414,DOCTOR: Yes. 
415,AMY: Good. 
416,DOCTOR: I know. 
417, [Room] 
418, OSWIN: Unauthorised personnel may not enter the
419,cockpit. 
420, [Cockpit] 
421, DOCTOR: Shut up. 
422,"OSWIN : Oh, Mister Grumpy. "
423, [Room] 
424, OSWIN: Bad combo. No sense of humour in that chin.
425,
426,"AMY [on screen]: Is that her again, soufflé girl? "
427,"DOCTOR [on screen]: Yeah, she. Oi, what is wrong with my chin? "
428,"OSWIN: Careful, dear. You'll put someone's eye out. "
429, [Cockpit] 
430, OSWIN : Scanning you. You're in another of the
431,"escape pods from the Alaska, right? "
432, [Room] 
433, OSWIN: Same ship I was on. 
434,DOCTOR [on screen]: How can you hack into everything? It should be
435,impossible. You're in a crashed ship! 
436,OSWIN: Long story. Is there a word for total screaming genius that
437,sounds modest and a tiny bit sexy? 
438,DOCTOR [on screen]: Doctor. You call me the Doctor. 
439,OSWIN: See what you did there. 
440,(Beep.) 
441,OSWIN: Check the floor. I'm picking up a breach at floor level. There
442,could be a way out. See you later. 
443, [Cockpit] 
444, DOCTOR: Ah ha! Hatch. Looks like it's been used
445,already and they've tried to block it off behind them. 
446,AMY: Can't imagine why. 
447,"DOCTOR: The lower part of the pod is buried, so this must go straight"
448,down to the Asylum. 
449,AMY: Where Rory is. 
450,"DOCTOR: Speaking of Rory, is there anything you want to tell me? "
451,AMY: Are we going to do this now? 
452,DOCTOR: What happened? 
453,"AMY: Oh, stuff. You know. We split up. What can you do? "
454,DOCTOR: What can I do? 
455,AMY: Nothing. It's not one of those things you can fix like you fix
456,"your bowtie. Don't give me those big wet eyes, Raggedy Man. It's life."
457,Just life. That thing that goes on when you're not there. 
458,"(The Doctor gets the hatch open. A shaft heads down into the planet,"
459,with a flexible metal ladder hanging down it.) 
460,"AMY: Okay, so somebody else got out this way, then. "
461,"DOCTOR: Yeah, let's go and find them. Oh, hello, hello, hello. What are"
462,they up to? 
463,"(The zombies are on a small monitor on the wall, waving something at"
464,the camera.) 
465,AMY: What's that? 
466,DOCTOR: One of these. (a wristband) But where did they get it? 
467,(They pulled it off Amy's wrist a few minutes ago.) 
468,"AMY: Doctor, they got it from me. "
469,"DOCTOR: Oh, Amy. "
470,"AMY: Doctor, what's going to happen to me? Seriously. Tell me what. "
471, [Chamber] 
472, (Rory is using the small penlight he always

474,"surroundings. He kicks a piece of metal, and a Dalek's eyepiece starts"
475,to glow.) 
476,RORY: Shush. 
477,"(Other Daleks start to boot up, too, making sounds.) "
478,"RORY: What? Sorry, what? "
479,DALEK: Eg eg eg eg eg eg eg. 
480,RORY: Eggs? You mean those things? 
481,(The roundels on the Dalek's casing. Some have fallen off onto the
482,floor.) 
483,DALEK: Egg. 
484,"RORY: I don't, I don't know what you want. Those things. Are those"
485,things eggs? This? You want this. 
486,DALEK: Egg. Stir. Min. Ate. 
487,(Rory drops the ball.) 
488,DALEK: Exterminate. 
489,DALEKS: Exterminate. 
490,(One weapon blast just misses him. Rory tries to run the gauntlet.) 
491,DALEK: Emergency. Emergency. Exterminate. Exterminate. 
492,"OSWIN : Run! The door at the end, run for it. They're waking up,"
493,but they're slow. The door at the end. Just run. Now! Now! Now! 
494,DALEKS: Exterminate. Exterminate. 
495,(The door rises up as Rory runs. He slides underneath and it shuts
496,behind him.) 
497, [Corridor] 
498," OSWIN : So, anyway, I'm Oswin. What do I call"
499,you? 
500,"RORY: Er, I can't remember. Er, Rory. "
501, [Room] 
502," OSWIN: Lovely name, Rory. First boy I ever fancied"
503,was called Rory. 
504,RORY [on screen]: Okay. 
505,"OSWIN: Actually, she was called Nina. I was going through a phase. "
506, [Corridor] 
507, OSWIN : Just flirting to keep you cheerful. 
508,DALEKS : Exterminate. Exterminate. 
509,"RORY: Er, okay, any time you want to start flirting again is fine by"
510,me. 
511, [Another corridor] 
512, (The Doctor and Amy are climbing down the ladder
513,from the cockpit into another corridor.) 
514,"AMY: So tell me, what's going to happen to me? And don't lie. Because I"
515,know when you're lying to me and I will definitely fall on you. 
516,DOCTOR: The air all around is full of micro-machines. Robots the size
517,"of molecules. Nanogenes. Now that you're unprotected, you're being"
518,re-written. 
519,"AMY: So, what happens? I get one of those things sticking out of my"
520,head? 
521,DOCTOR: Physical changes come later. 
522,AMY: What comes first? How does it start? 
523,"DOCTOR: With your mind. Your feelings, your memories, and I'm sorry but"
524,it's started already. 
525,AMY: How do you know? 
526,DOCTOR: Because we've had this conversation four times. 
527,"AMY: Okay, scared now. "
528,DOCTOR: Hang on to scared. Scared isn't Dalek. 
529, [Corridor] 
530, (Rory's torch starts to flicker.) 
531,"OSWIN : Hey there, beakie boy. "
532,"RORY: If it's a straight choice, I prefer Nina. "
533,OSWIN : Loving this. The nose and the chin. 
534, [Room] 
535, OSWIN: You two could fence. There's a door behind
536,you. 
537,(The door rises and Rory runs through into a room with a large round
538,platform in the middle.) 
539,"OSWIN: In there, quickly. Okay, you're safe for now. Pop your shirt"
540,"off, quick as you like. "
541,RORY [on screen]: Why? 
542,OSWIN: Does there have to be a reason? 
543, [Chamber] 
544, (A door rises to let Amy and the Doctor into the
545,place where Rory met the Daleks. The bad-tempered pepperpots are still
546,repeating their favourite word some way away. The Doctor sniffs.) 
547,AMY: What's that? 
548,(They back out again.) 
549, [Outside the chamber] 
550, DOCTOR: Keep a look out. Don't open this door.
551,Oswin! 
552,(Amy's head hurts.) 
553,"DOCTOR: Oswin, can you hear me? "
554, [Room] 
555," OSWIN: Hello, the chin. I have visual on you. "
556,DOCTOR [on screen]: Why don't I have a visual on you? Why can't I ever
557,see you? 
558,"OSWIN: Limited power, bad hair, take your pick. There's a door to your"
559,left. Open it. 
560, [Outside the chamber] 
561, OSWIN : I'm going to send you a map to that
562,screen. I put your little friend somewhere safe. I can get you to him. 
563, [Room] 
564, DOCTOR [on screen]: Rory. You found Rory? 
565,OSWIN: I call him Nina. Personal thing. Hush now. 
566, [Outside the chamber] 
567, (Amy looks through the transparent panels in the
568,door and sees a man in a suit standing in the chamber.) 
569,AMY: Who are you? Doctor? 
570,"(There are lots of people in the chamber now, men and women in various"
571,styles of dress from formal evening wear to a little red-haired girl in
572,a ballet tutu. Amy opens the door and goes in.) 
573, [Room] 
574, DOCTOR [on screen]: How many Daleks directly ahead
575,of me right now? 
576,"OSWIN: Ten, twenty. "
577, [Outside the chamber] 
578, OSWIN : Hard to say. Some of them are
579,catatonic but they do have firepower. 
580,DOCTOR: How do I get past them? Amy! 
581, [Chamber] 
582," AMY: Shush. It's okay, it's just people in here."
583,It's just people. 
584,"DOCTOR: Amy, it's the nanocloud, it's altering your perception. Look"
585,again. Look again. Those aren't people. 
586,(Now she sees Daleks.) 
587,"DOCTOR: Amy, come out. Take my hand. Run! Run! "
588, [Corridor] 
589," (They run back to the rope ladder, which is moving"
590,under the weight of descending zombies.) 
591,"AMY: Look, they're coming down! "
592,"DOCTOR: Er, oh yes, they are. "
593,DALEK: Intruder. 
594,DOCTOR: Run. 
595,DALEK: Intruder. 
596,(They hide in the cubby hole Oswin opened for the Doctor.) 
597,DALEK: Intruder. 
598,(It runs out of power. They come out of the cubby hole again.) 
599,DOCTOR: It's damaged. 
600,"AMY: Okay, but what do we do? "
601,DOCTOR: Identify me. Access your files. Who am I? Come on. Who's your
602,daddy? 
603,DALEK: You are the Predator. 
604,DOCTOR: Access your standing orders concerning the Predator. 
605,DALEK: The Predator must be destroyed. 
606,"DOCTOR: And how are you going to do that, Dalek? Without a gun you're a"
607,tricycle with a roof. How are you going to destroy me? 
608,DALEK: Self-destruct initiated. 
609,AMY: What's it doing? 
610,"DOCTOR: It's going to blow itself up, and I with it. Only weapon it's"
611,got left. 
612,DALEK: Self-destruct cannot be countermanded. 
613,(It's internal clock is down to 12. The Doctor lifts its lid and scans
614,inside.) 
615,"DOCTOR: I'm not looking for a countermand, dear. I'm looking for"
616,reverse. 
617,"DALEK: Forward, forward. "
618,"(The Dalek whizzes backwards into the chamber, bumps into a colleague"
619,and blows up.) 
620, [Teleport room] 
621, (The explosion is felt here.) 
622,RORY: Oswin? 
623, [Room] 
624, RORY [on screen]: What was that? That was close. 
625, [Chamber] 
626, (Rory runs in to see the smoking remains of Dalek
627,shells.) 
628,RORY: Oswin? What happened? Who killed all the Daleks? 
629,"(The Doctor enters from the other side, carrying Amy.) "
630,DOCTOR: Who do you think? 
631, [Teleport room] 
632, (The Doctor lays Amy on the teleport pad.) 
633,RORY: Will sleeping help her? Will it slow down the process? 
634,OSWIN : You'd better hope so 
635, [Room] 
636, OSWIN: Because pretty soon she's going to try and
637,kill you. 
638, [Teleport room] 
639, DOCTOR: Amy. 
640,AMY: Ow. 
641,DOCTOR: Amy. Still with us. 
642,"RORY: Amy, it's me. Do you remember me? "
643,(Amy slaps Rory.) 
644,RORY: She remembers me. 
645,DOCTOR: Same old Amy. 
646, [Room] 
647, OSWIN: Do you know how you make someone into a
648,"Dalek? Subtract love, add anger. Doesn't she seem a bit too angry to"
649,you? 
650, [Teleport room] 
651," AMY: Well, somebody's never been to Scotland. "
652,"DOCTOR: What about you, though, Oswin. How come you're okay? "
653, [Room] 
654, DOCTOR [on screen]: Why hasn't the nanocloud
655,converted you? 
656,"OSWIN: I mentioned the genius thing, yeah? Shielded in here. "
657, [Teleport room] 
658," DOCTOR: Clever of you. Now, this place. The Daleks"
659,said it was fully automated. Look at it. It's a wreck. 
660, [Room] 
661," OSWIN: Well, I've had nearly a year to mess with"
662,"them, and not a lot else to do. "
663,DOCTOR [on screen]: A junior entertainment manager hiding out in a
664,"wrecked ship, hacking the security systems of the most advanced warrior"
665,race 
666, [Teleport room] 
667, DOCTOR: The universe has ever seen. But you know
668,"what really gets me about you, Oswin? The soufflés. Where do you get"
669,milk 
670, [Room] 
671, DOCTOR [on screen]: For the soufflés? 
672, [Teleport room] 
673, DOCTOR: Seriously. Is no one else wondering about
674,that? 
675,"RORY: No. Frankly, no. Twice. "
676,"OSWIN : So, Doctor. "
677, [Room] 
678, OSWIN: I've been looking you up. You're all over
679,the database. Why do the Daleks call you the Predator? 
680,"DOCTOR [on screen]: I'm not the Predator, I'm just a man with a plan. "
681,OSWIN: You've got a plan? 
682, [Teleport room] 
683, RORY: That's all he is. 
684,AMY: There's a nose joke going if someone wants to pick that one off. 
685,"DOCTOR: In no particular order, we need to neutralise all the Daleks in"
686,"this Asylum, rescue Oswin from the wreckage, escape from this planet"
687,and fix Amy and Rory's marriage. 
688,"AMY: Okay, I'm counting three lost causes. Anyone else? "
689,"DOCTOR: Oswin, there's a Dalek ship in orbit. "
690,OSWIN : Yes. Got it on the sensors 
691,DOCTOR: The Asylum has a forcefield. The Daleks upstairs are waiting
692,"for me to turn it off. Soon as I do, they'll burn this whole world and"
693,us with it. 
694, [Room] 
695," DOCTOR [on screen]: So, Oswin, my question is"
696,this. How fast can you drop the forcefield? 
697,OSWIN: Pretty fast. But why would I? 
698,"DOCTOR [on screen]: Because this is a teleport. Am I right, Oswin? "
699,OSWIN: Yeah. Internal use only. 
700, [Teleport room] 
701, DOCTOR: I can boost the power. Once the forcefield
702,"is down, I can use it to beam us right off this planet. "
703,"RORY: You said when the forcefield is down, the Daleks will blow us up."
704,
705,"DOCTOR: We'll have to be quick, yes. "
706,"AMY: Fine, we'll be quick. But where do we beam to? "
707,DOCTOR: The only place within range. The Dalek ship. 
708,AMY: They'll exterminate us on the spot. 
709,"RORY: Ah, so this is the kind of escape plan where you survive about"
710,four seconds longer. 
711,DOCTOR: What's wrong with four seconds? You can do loads in four
712,"seconds. Oswin, how fast can you drop the forcefield? "
713, [Room] 
714," OSWIN: I can do it from here, as soon as you come"
715,and get me. 
716, [Teleport room] 
717," DOCTOR: No, just drop the forcefield and come to"
718,us. 
719, [Room] 
720, OSWIN: There's enough power in that teleport for
721,one go. Why would you wait for me? 
722, [Teleport room] 
723, DOCTOR: Why wouldn't I? 
724, [Room] 
725, OSWIN: No idea. Never met you. Sending you a map
726,so you can come get me. 
727, [Teleport room] 
728, RORY: This place is crawling with Daleks. 
729, [Room] 
730, OSWIN: Yeah. Kind of why I'm anxious to leave.
731,Come up and see me sometime. 
732, [Teleport room] 
733," RORY: So, are we going to go get her? "
734,"DOCTOR: I don't think that we have a choice. Okay, as soon as the"
735,forcefield is down the Daleks will attack. If it gets too explody-wody
736,"in here, you go without me, okay? "
737,RORY: And leave you to die? 
738,"DOCTOR: Oh, don't worry about me. You're the one beaming up to a Dalek"
739,ship to get exterminated. 
740,RORY: Fair point. Love this plan. What about Amy? 
741,"DOCTOR: Keep her remembering, keep her focused. That'll hold back the"
742,conversion. 
743,AMY: What do I do? 
744,DOCTOR: You heard what she said. They're subtracting love. Don't let
745,them. 
746, [Corridor] 
747, (The Doctor makes his way carefully.) 
748,DALEKS : Emergency. Emergency. Prepare to be annihilated.
749,Emergency. We are the Daleks. We are the Daleks. 
750, [Teleport room] 
751," RORY: Okay, look at me. I'm going to be logical."
752,"Cold and logical, okay? For both of our sakes, for both of us, I'm"
753,going to take this off my wrist and put it on yours. 
754,AMY: Why? Then it'll just start converting you. That's not better. 
755,"RORY: Yes, but it'll buy us time, because it'll take longer with me. "
756,"AMY: Sorry, what? "
757,"RORY: It subtracts love, that's what she said. "
758,AMY: What's that got to do with it? What does that even mean? 
759,"RORY: It's arithmetic. It'll take longer with me because we both know,"
760,"we've always known, that. Amy, the basic fact of our relationship is"
761,"that I love you more than you love me, which today is good news because"
762,it might just save both of our lives. 
763,AMY: How can you say that? 
764,"RORY: Two thousand years, waiting for you outside a box. Don't say it"
765,"isn't true, you know it's true. Give me your arm. Amy! "
766,(Amy slaps Rory.) 
767,AMY: Don't you dare say that to me. Don't you ever dare. 
768,"RORY: Amy, you kicked me out. "
769,AMY: You want kids. You have always wanted kids. Ever since you were a
770,kid. And I can't have them. 
771,RORY: I know. 
772,"AMY: Whatever they did to me at Demons Run, I can't ever give you"
773,children. I didn't kick you out. I gave you up. 
774,"RORY: Amy, I don't "
775,"AMY: Don't you dare talk to me about waiting outside a box, because"
776,"that is nothing, Rory, nothing, compared to giving you up. "
777,RORY: Just give me your arm. Let me put this on you. Just give me your
778,arm! 
779,AMY: Don't touch me! 
780,(She is already wearing a wristband.) 
781,RORY: It's the Doctor's. When you were sleeping 
782,AMY: That Time Lord. What's the betting he doesn't even need it. 
783,RORY: Why didn't he just tell us? 
784,(Amy sees the Doctor straighten his bow tie on a monitor.) 
785, [Corridor] 
786," DOCTOR: Oswin, I think I'm close. "
787, [Room] 
788, OSWIN: You are. Less than twenty feet away. Which
789,is the good news. 
790, [Corridor] 
791, DOCTOR: Okay. And the bad which I suddenly feel is
792,coming? 
793, [Room] 
794, OSWIN: You're about to pass through Intensive
795,Care. 
796, [Intensive Care] 
797, (The Daleks here are in cages.) 
798,"DOCTOR: What's so special about this lot, then? "
799,OSWIN : Don't know. 
800, [Room] 
801," OSWIN: Survivors of particular wars. Spiridon,"
802,"Kembel, Aridius, Vulcan, Exxilon. Ringing any bells? "
803, [Intensive Care] 
804, DOCTOR: All of them. 
805,OSWIN : Yeah? How? 
806,DOCTOR: These are the Daleks who survived me. 
807,DALEK: Doctor. 
808,DALEK 2: Doctor. 
809,DALEKS: Doctor. 
810, [Room] 
811, OSWIN: That's weird. Those ones don't usually wake
812,up for anything. 
813,"DOCTOR : Yeah, well "
814, [Intensive Care] 
815," DOCTOR: Special visitor. Okay, door, but it won't"
816,"open. I can't be far away, though. "
817, [Room] 
818, OSWIN: Hang on. Not quite sure. There's a release
819,code. Let me just 
820, [Intensive care] 
821, OSWIN : Anything out there? 
822,DOCTOR: No. 
823, [Room] 
824," OSWIN: Hang on, I'm trying to think. "
825, [Intensive Care] 
826," (One Dalek has been disarmed, literally, and"
827,chained up.) 
828,DALEK: Doctor. 
829,(It breaks its chains.) 
830,DALEKS: Doctor. Doctor. 
831,"DOCTOR: Oswin, get this door open. "
832, [Room] 
833," DOCTOR : Oswin, open this door! "
834,OSWIN: I can't! 
835, [Intensive Care] 
836, DOCTOR: Oswin. 
837,(The Daleks are closing in.) 
838, [Room] 
839, DOCTOR : Just get this door open! 
840, [Intensive Care] 
841," DOCTOR: Oswin! Oswin, please! Get this door open!"
842,Help me! 
843,(A plunger is heading for the Doctor's face.) 
844,DOCTOR: Stop! 
845,"(The Daleks stop, then turn away.) "
846,"OSWIN : Oh, that is cool. "
847, [Room] 
848," OSWIN: Tell me I'm cool, chin boy. "
849, [Intensive Care] 
850," DOCTOR: What, what did you do? "
851, [Room] 
852," OSWIN: Hang on, I think I've found the door"
853,thingy. 
854, [Intensive Care] 
855," DOCTOR: No, tell me what you did. "
856,"OSWIN : The Daleks, they have a hive mind. Well, they don't, they"
857,have a sort of telepathic web. 
858,"DOCTOR: The path web, yes. "
859, [Room] 
860," OSWIN: I hacked into it, did a mass delete "
861, [Intensive Care] 
862, OSWIN : On all the information connected with
863,the Doctor. 
864,DOCTOR: You made them forget me? 
865, [Room] 
866," OSWIN: Good, eh? And here comes the door. "
867, [Intensive Care] 
868, (The door rises.) 
869,DOCTOR: I've tried hacking into the path web. Even I couldn't do it. 
870, [Room] 
871," OSWIN: Come and meet the girl who can. Hey, you're"
872,right outside. Come on in. 
873,"DOCTOR [on screen]: Oswin, we have a problem. "
874,"OSWIN: No, we don't. Don't even say that. Joined the Alaska to see the"
875,"universe, ended up stuck in a shipwreck first time out. Rescue me, chin"
876,"boy, and show me the stars. "
877,DOCTOR [on screen]: Does it look real to you? 
878,OSWIN: Does what look real? 
879,DOCTOR [on screen]: Where you are right now. 
880, [Padded cell] 
881, DOCTOR: Does it seem real? 
882, [Room] 
883, OSWIN: It is real. 
884,"DOCTOR [on screen]: It's a dream, Oswin. You dreamed it for yourself"
885,because the truth was too terrible. 
886,OSWIN: Where am I? 
887, [Padded cell] 
888, (A Dalek has chains draped over it.) 
889,DALEK: Where am I? Where am I? 
890,DOCTOR: Because you are a Dalek.

895, [Room] 
896, OSWIN: I'm human. 
897, [Padded cell] 
898, DOCTOR: You were human when you crashed here. It
899,was you who climbed out of the pod. That was your ladder. 
900,OSWIN [memory]: Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? 
901, [Room] 
902, OSWIN: You mean? 
903, [Padded cell] 
904, DALEK: Human. 
905,DOCTOR: Not any more. Because you're right. You're a genius. And the
906,"Daleks need genius. They didn't just make you a puppet, they did a full"
907,conversion. 
908, [Room] 
909, OSWIN [memory]: Where am I? Where am I? Where am
910,I? 
911,"DOCTOR [on screen]: Oswin, I am so sorry, but you are a Dalek. The"
912,"milk, Oswin. The milk and the eggs for the souffléss. Where, where did"
913,it all come from? 
914,"OSWIN [memory]: Eggs. I'm human. I am not a Dalek, I am human. I am not"

920,OSWIN + DALEK: Eggs. 
921,DALEK: Stir. Min. Ate.
