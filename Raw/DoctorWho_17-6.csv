19,"action at the BBC, and never broadcast apart from the sequence of the"
20,Doctor and Romana punting on the River Cam and a bit of chase scene
21,which was used in the Five Doctors.) The existing footage was released
22,on videotape with linking narration by Tom Baker filmed in the Doctor
23,"Who area of the Museum Of The Moving Image, which sadly closed in 1999. "
24,"In 2003, Big Finish Productions was commissioned to make an  audio version with Paul McGann. "

28,[FSAS Space Station]
29,
30,(Inside a space station hanging by a red giant
31,"star, six men dressed in white sit in recliners with their heads"
32,towards a central device with a globe on it. Very Alien. A monitor
33,"starts counting down in roman numerals, from XXX. One of the men is  Christopher"
34,"Neame, who is dressed slightly differently from the others,"
35,"and has a nasty scar down his right cheek. When the countdown finishes,"
36,"his eyes open. Another count begins, this time going upwards. The other"
37,five men start jerking in their seats while our man gets up and goes to
38,"a wall panel, where he presses some buttons. The countdown reverses back up to XXX. The men stop jerking, and"
39,voices begin whispering. Eventually they become still. Our man walks to
40,a control console and flicks some more switches. A male voice comes from the
41,speakers.) 
42,COMPUTER : This is a recorded message. The Foundation for the Study
43,for Advanced Sciences is under strict quarantine. Do not approach. Do
44,not approach. Everything is under our control. 
45,"(The man holds up his hand, and the sphere from the top of device rises"
46,into the air and glides into it. He leaves. The computer repeats its
47,message as the man goes into the shuttlebay. Then the five remaining
48,men jerk briefly and get up. They stagger around then fall down as a
49,spaceship undocks and flies away.)
50,[St Cedd's College]
51,
52,(Daniel
53,"Hill bicycles through Cambridge like any other student, on a"
54,"bike with a wicker basket on the front, then puts it into a stand"
55,outside a college entrance and walks through to the quad. He checks a
56,piece of paper then stops a student.) 
57,PARSONS: Excuse me. 
58,STUDENT: Yeah? 
59,PARSONS: Do you know where P14 is? 
60,"STUDENT: Yes, it's over there, okay? "
61,PARSONS: Thanks. 
62,(He heads off across the inner yard flagstones to the Don's climber-covered
63,residential block.)
64,
65, [Prof. Chronotis' rooms] 
66,(A white-haired and bearded Professor wearing a
67,black academic gown is unpacking a briefcase. He unwinds his scarf and
68,removes the gown to reveal a slightly tatty jacket underneath. His
69,"study is lined from floor to ceiling with bookshelves, and the tables"
70,are also loaded with volumes. A police telephone box sits somewhat out
71,"of place amongst it all. The Professor looks at it, then goes and draws"
72,his curtains. There is a knock at the door.)Â 
73,CHRONOTIS: Come in. 
74,"(Parsons enters. Chronotis does not look to see who it is, but heads"
75,off to the kitchen.) 
76,"CHRONOTIS: Excuse the muddle. Creative disarray, you know. "
77,PARSONS: Professor Chronotis? 
78,CHRONOTIS : Tea? 
79,"PARSONS: Oh, thanks. "
80,CHRONOTIS: Just put the kettle on. 
81,"PARSONS: Er, Professor Chronotis, I don't know if you remember me. We"
82,met at a faculty party a few weeks ago. It's Chris Parsons. 
83,"CHRONOTIS: Oh yes, of course. Enjoy these faculty dos, do you? "
84,"PARSONS: Well, you know, it's "
85,"CHRONOTIS: A lot of boring old dons talking away at each other, who"
86,never listen to a word anybody else says. 
87,"PARSONS: No, well, you said that "
88,"CHRONOTIS: Talk, talk, talk. Never listen. "
89,"PARSONS: No, well, er, look, I hope I'm not taking up any of your"
90,valuable 
91,"CHRONOTIS: Time? Oh no. When you get to my age, you'll find that time"
92,doesn't matter too much. Not that I expect you'll get to my age. 
93,"PARSONS: Oh, really? "
94,"CHRONOTIS: Oh, yes. I remember talking to the last Master of College but"
95,"one, or was it the last Master but two? Could have been three. "
96,PARSONS: Three? 
97,"CHRONOTIS: Yes, nice young chap. Died rather tragically at the age of"
98,oh. Run over by a coach and pair. 
99,PARSONS: What was it you said to him? 
100,"CHRONOTIS: Oh, I don't know. Long time ago, you know. "
101,"PARSONS: Yes. Professor, when we met you were kind enough to say that"
102,if I dropped round you would lend me some of your books on carbon
103,dating. 
104,"CHRONOTIS: Oh yes, of course. Happy to. Ah, there's the kettle. "
105,(Chronitis disappears into the kitchen.) 
106,PARSONS: Professor? 
107,CHRONOTIS: You'll find the books you want at the far end of this bookshelf. Third shelf down. 
108,(He goes back into the kitchen.) 
109,PARSONS: Thanks. 
110,"CHRONOTIS : Or is it the second shelf down? Second, I think. Anyway, take what you want. Milk? "
111,"PARSONS: Oh, yes please. "
112,CHRONOTIS : One lump or two? 
113,PARSONS: Two please. 
114,CHRONOTIS : Sugar? 
115,(Chronotis enters with two china cups of tea on a tray.) 
116,"CHRONOTIS: Ah, Here we are. "
117,(Parsons tucks his three selected books under his arm and looks at his wrist
118,watch.) 
119,"PARSONS: Oh, actually Professor, I've just realised I'm going to be"
120,"really late for a seminar. Look, I'm terribly sorry. Look, I'll bring"
121,"these back to you next week, all right? "
122,"CHRONOTIS: Yes, of course. Goodbye. "
123,(Chronotis takes his newly purchased slim paperback out of its plastic bag.) 
124,"PARSONS: Goodbye. Actually, Professor, could I just ask you, where did"
125,you get that? 
126,(He points to the Tardis.) 
127,"CHRONOTIS: Oh, I don't know. I think someone must have left it there"
128,when I was out. 
129,"PARSONS: Yes, well, I'll bring these back as soon as I can. "
130,(Parsons leaves. Chronotis settles down to read his Pan paperback copy of The Time Machine by H G Wells.)
131,
132,[River Cam]
133,
134,(The Doctor is punting Romana along The Backs. She
135,is reading a book.) 
136,"DOCTOR: Wordsworth, Rutherford, Christopher Smart, Andrew Marvel, Judge"
137,"Jefferies, Owen Chadwick. "
138,ROMANA: Who? 
139,"DOCTOR: Owen Chadwick. Oh, yes. Some of the greatest labourers in the"
140,history of Earth have thought here. 
141,"ROMANA: Newton, of course. "
142,"DOCTOR: Oh, definitely Newton. "
143,"ROMANA: For every action, there is a equal and opposite reaction. "
144,DOCTOR: That's right. 
145,ROMANA: So Newton invented punting. 
146,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. There was no limit to Isaac's genius. "
147,ROMANA: Isn't it wonderful how something so primitive can be so 
148,DOCTOR: Restful? 
149,"ROMANA: No, simple. You just push in one direction and the boat goes in"
150,"the other. Oh, I do love the spring. All the leaves, the colours. "
151,DOCTOR: It's October. 
152,ROMANA: I thought that you said we were coming here for May week. 
153,DOCTOR: I did. May week's in June. 
154,ROMANA: I'm confused. 
155,DOCTOR: So was the Tardis. 
156,"ROMANA: Oh, I do love the autumn. All the leaves, the colours. "
157,"DOCTOR: Yes. Well, at least with something as simple as a punt nothing"
158,"can go wrong. No coordinates, no dimensional stabilisers, nothing. Just"
159,"the water, a punt, a strong pair of hands and the pole. "
160,(Whereupon the pole gets stuck in the mud of the riverbed and the
161,Doctor has to let it go. They drift on under a bridge.) 
162,ROMANA: The pole. 
163,"DOCTOR: Er, I think it's about time that we go and see if the Professor"
164,is back in his room. Ask me how. 
165,(The man from the spacestation watches them drift under the bridge. He
166,"has a large carpet bag with him, and has acquired a large white hat and"
167,cloak to complete a Renaissance look.) 
168,ROMANA: How? 
169,DOCTOR: For every reaction there is an opposite and equally different
170,action. 
171,(The whisper of many voices is briefly heard before he walks away.) 
172,ROMANA: Did you just heard voices? 
173,DOCTOR: What? 
174,(The Doctor has found a paddle.) 
175,
176,[Physics lab]
177,
178,(Parsons places one of the books on top of two others - Hypnosis And The Law and Zaphod: My Stories. It slides off them onto the table. 
179,"He opens it to discover it is written in an alien script. The time on the clock flies back and forth as he riffles through the pages, "
180,"ending up where it started when he closes the book. He sniffs the book, then feels the cover and opens it. But when he reaches for a "
181,"magnifying glass it snaps itself shut again. He tries stabbing it with a scalpel, but it moves out of the way of the blade.)"
182,
183, [St Cedd's College]
184,
185,
186,"DOCTOR: (still carrying the paddle) Here we are, St. Cedd's College, Cambridge."
187,"Founded in the year something or other, by someone someone in honour of"
188,someone someone someone. In honour of someone who's name escapes me
189,completely. 
190,ROMANA: Saint Cedd? 
191,DOCTOR: Do you know I think you're very probably right. You should have
192,been an historian. 
193,ROMANA: I am an historian. 
194,"(The Doctor goes over to the college porter, who is putting notices up"
195,on a board on an easel.) 
196,"DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Wilkin. "
197,"(Yaroo, everybody. It's  Gerald"
198,"Campion, the original TV Billy Bunter.) "
199,"WILKIN: Good afternoon, Doctor. "
200,DOCTOR: Wilkin! You remembered me. 
201,"WILKIN: Why, yes, of course, sir. An honorary degree in 1960. "
202,"DOCTOR: Yes, but how kind of you to remember me. "
203,"WILKIN: That's my job, sir. "
204,DOCTOR: And you do it splendidly. Now 
205,"WILKIN: Professor Chronotis, sir? He returned to his room a few minutes"
206,ago. 
207,"DOCTOR: Oh good, good, good. Wilkin, how did you know I wanted to speak"
208,to Professor Chronotis? 
209,"WILKIN: Because that's who you asked for when you were here in 1964,"
210,"1960 and 1955, sir. "
211,DOCTOR: Did I really? I was here in 1958. 
212,"WILKIN: Were you, sir? "
213,"DOCTOR: Yes, but in a different body. "
214,"WILKIN: (laughs) Yes, sir. "
215,"ROMANA: Come along, Doctor. "
216,(The Doctor hands Wilkin the punt paddle.) 
217,"DOCTOR: Nice to meet you, Wilkin. Bye, bye. (to Romana) Come on."
218,
219,[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]
220,
221,(The Professor throws his book onto a table and
222,gets up. There is a knock at the door.) 
223,CHRONOTIS: Come in. 
224,(Chronotis goes into the kitchen. The Doctor and Romana enter.) 
225,DOCTOR: Come in. Over there. He'll ask us if we want tea. 
226,CHRONOTIS : Tea? 
227,"DOCTOR: Yes, please. Two cups. "
228,CHRONOTIS : Milk? 
229,"DOCTOR: Yes, please. "
230,CHRONOTIS : One lump or two? 
231,"DOCTOR: Two please, and two sugars. "
232,"CHRONOTIS : Oh, Doctor. "
233,(Chronotis comes out with the tray.) 
234,"CHRONOTIS: Oh, Doctor! How splendid to see you. "
235,"DOCTOR: You too, Professor. This is Romana. "
236,"CHRONOTIS: Oh, delighted, delighted. I've heard so much about you. "
237,DOCTOR: Have you really? 
238,"CHRONOTIS: Well, not yet, but I will have done. When Time Lords get to"
239,my age they tend to get their tenses muddled up. Would you liked some
240,biscuits too? 
241,"DOCTOR: Well, I wouldn't have said no. "
242,CHRONOTIS: Crackers? 
243,"DOCTOR: Oh, sometimes. "
244,"(The spaceman walks through Cambridge with his whispering carpet bag. A little later, tea and biscuits"
245,are being enjoyed.) 
246,ROMANA: Three hundred years? 
247,"CHRONOTIS: Yes, my dear. "
248,ROMANA: And in the same set of rooms? 
249,CHRONOTIS: Ever since I retired from Gallifrey. 
250,ROMANA: Didn't anybody notice? 
251,CHRONOTIS: One of the delights of the older Cambridge colleges.
252,"Everyone is so discreet. Now Doctor, young fellow, what can I do for"
253,you? 
254,DOCTOR: What can you do for me? You mean what can I do for you? You
255,sent for me. 
256,CHRONOTIS: Sent for you? 
257,"DOCTOR: Yes, we got your signal. "
258,CHRONOTIS: Signal? What signal? 
259,"DOCTOR: Romana, didn't we get a signal from the Professor, would we"
260,come as soon as possible? 
261,ROMANA: Yes. We come straight away. 
262,"CHRONOTIS: I never sent you a signal, but it's very splendid to see"
263,you. Have another cracker. 
264,"DOCTOR: I will. Professor, if you didn't send a signal, who did, hmm?"
265,
266, [St Cedd's College] 
267, (The spaceman marches through the arch and calls
268,to the porter without looking at him.) 
269,SKAGRA: You! You! 
270,(Wilkin finishes putting a notice on the board and walks over.) 
271,WILKIN: Were you addressing me? 
272,SKAGRA: I want Chronotis. 
273,WILKIN: Professor Chronotis. 
274,SKAGRA: Where is he? 
275,WILKIN: He will not wish to be disturbed. He is with the Doctor. A very
276,"old, a very old friend. "
277,(Skagra leaves the college.)
278,
279, [Prof. Chronotis' rooms]
280,
281,(More tea is about to be poured.) 
282,CHRONOTIS: Wait. 
283,ROMANA: What for? 
284,CHRONOTIS: I've had an idea who sent that message. 
285,ROMANA: Who? 
286,CHRONOTIS: Me. 
287,DOCTOR: I thought you said you didn't. 
288,"CHRONOTIS: Yes, I know. Memory's getting a bit touchy of late. Doesn't"
289,"like to be prodded about too much. But my dear old things, it must be"
290,ages since I send it. 
291,"ROMANA: I told you you'd got the time wrong, Doctor. "
292,"DOCTOR: Yes, but you're always saying that. "
293,ROMANA: You're always getting the time wrong. 
294,DOCTOR: Professor? 
295,CHRONOTIS : Yes? 
296,"DOCTOR: What was it about, Professor? "
297,CHRONOTIS : What was what about? 
298,DOCTOR: The message? 
299,(Chronotis comes out of the kitchen with a fresh pot of tea.) 
300,CHRONOTIS: I don't know. You've seen it more recently than I have. 
301,DOCTOR: Was it to do with the voices? 
302,CHRONOTIS: What voices? 
303,"DOCTOR: Well, when I was on the river I heard a strange babble of"
304,"inhuman voices, didn't you, Romana? "
305,ROMANA: Yes. 
306,"CHRONOTIS: Oh, undergraduates talking to each other, I expect. I've"
307,trying to have it banned. 
308,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. It wasn't like that at all. It was the sound of"
309,"humans, or, or ghosts, very quietly "
310,ROMANA: Screaming. 
311,DOCTOR: Yes. 
312,"CHRONOTIS: Overwrought imaginings, Doctor. No, I remember what it was. "
313,DOCTOR: What? 
314,"CHRONOTIS: Delicate matter, slightly. It, it was about a book."
315,
316,
317,[Physics lab]
318,
319,"(Parsons frowns at the book and puts it into a x-ray scanner compartment set into the wall. The scanner explodes. The book is too hot to touch, but otherwise intact. "
320,"Parsons leave it alone, and it starts to glow and wibble slightly.)"

322,
323,[Cambridge]
324,
325,(Skagra walks down St Edwards Passage and comes out between a clothiers
326,"and a camera shop, where a car is parked. He looks through the shop"
327,"window until the driver leaves the shop and returns to his car, then"
328,approaches him.) 
329,SKAGRA: I say. 
330,MAN: Yes? Can I help you? 
331,"SKAGRA: Yes, perhaps you can. "
332,"(We don't hear the conversation, but the man lets Skagra get into the"
333,car with him and they drive away. Suddenly the car screeches to a halt in the middle of King's Parade. We 
334,next see it driving past St Cedd's with Skagra in the driving seat.)

336, [Prof. Chronotis' rooms]
337,
338,(Chronotis is handing Romana a pile of books when
339,he stops.) 
340,CHRONOTIS: Did you just hear voices? 
341,"DOCTOR: Professor, I think that. I just heard voices. Romana, did you"
342,just hear voices? 
343,"ROMANA: Yes, very faint this time. "
344,"DOCTOR: Anything to do with that book, Professor? "
345,"CHRONOTIS: What? Oh, no, no, no. That's just a book I accidentally"
346,bought back with me from Gallifrey. 
347,ROMANA: From Gallifrey? You brought a book from Gallifrey to
348,Cambridge? 
349,"CHRONOTIS: Well, just a few knick-knacks. You know how I love my books,"
350,Doctor. 
351,"DOCTOR: Professor, you said you brought it back by accident. "
352,CHRONOTIS: An oversight. I overlooked the fact that I had decided to
353,"bring it. Just for study, you know. And as I'm now getting very old... "
354,DOCTOR: You thought that perhaps I'd take it straight back to Gallifrey
355,for you. 
356,"CHRONOTIS: Well, as I'm retired, I'm not allowed to have a Tardis. "
357,"DOCTOR: Professor, I don't want to be critical but I will. It's very"
358,risky bringing books back from Gallifrey. 
359,CHRONOTIS: Is it? 
360,"DOCTOR: I mean, they could be so dangerous in the wrong hands, hmm? "
361,
362,[Telephone box]
363,
364,"PARSONS: Clare, hi. Yes, it's me. What? Yes, I'm fine. Listen, the most amazing... Well, just stop being busy. "
365,"This is important. There's this book, and it's got a molecular structure unlike anything I've ever seen before. "
366,"Yes, I said book. It's like nothing on Earth. Extraterrestrial. No, I'm not mad. Listen, I've done everything. "
367,"X-rays, microscope, you name it. Look, you don't have to believe everything till you've seen it yourself. "
368,"Yeah, come on over. No, not in two hours. Now. Great."

371,
372,"DOCTOR: (reads) On some nights, New York was as hot as Bangkok. (The"
373,Victim.) I've read that. 
374,ROMANA: Hmm. Saul Bellow. 
375,DOCTOR: Once upon a time. Read that. And ah. Ah ha. And in the ancient days of
376,"Rassilon, five great principles were laid down. Can you remember what"
377,"they were, my children? "
378,ROMANA: It's just a Gallifreyan Nursery Book. 
379,DOCTOR: I know it is. It's very good. 
380,ROMANA: I had it when I was a Time tot. 
381,"DOCTOR: Yes, it is good. "
382,"CHRONOTIS: Oh, that's just a memento. Not the right book at all. Where"
383,"is it? Is this the one? Oh dear, no. No, I know it's here somewhere. "
384,"DOCTOR: Professor? Professor? How many books did you bring back, for"
385,heaven's sake? 
386,"CHRONOTIS: Just the odd two or seven, but there was only one that was"

394,(The Doctor drops the large old tome he is holding.) 
395,DOCTOR: The Worshipful And Ancient Law Of Gallifrey? 
396,"CHRONOTIS: Yes. Red book, about five by seven. "
397,"DOCTOR: Professor, how did that book get out of the Panopticon"
398,Archives? 
399,"CHRONOTIS: Well, what I did you see was I, I just took it. "
400,DOCTOR: Took it? 
401,CHRONOTIS: Yes. There's no one interested in ancient history on
402,"Gallifrey any longer, and I thought that certain things would be safer"
403,with me. 
404,DOCTOR: And were they? 
405,"CHRONOTIS: Yes, in principle. "
406,"DOCTOR: Excuse me. Delicate matter, Professor, slightly. "
407,(The Doctor lifts Chronotis down off his library steps.) 
408,DOCTOR: That book dates back to the days of Rassilon. 
409,"CHRONOTIS: Does it? Yes, indeed. "
410,DOCTOR: It's one of the artefacts. 
411,"CHRONOTIS: Is it, indeed. "
412,"DOCTOR: Professor, you know that perfectly well. Rassilon had powers"
413,and secrets that even we don't fully understand. You've no idea what
414,might have been hidden in that book. 
415,"CHRONOTIS: Well, there's no chance of anyone else understanding it"
416,"then, is there? "
417,"DOCTOR: I only hope you're right, but we'd better find it. Romana? "
418,ROMANA: Yes?

457,"protect the ancient law of Gallifrey with all my might and main, and will to the end of my days with justice and with honour"

461,DOCTOR: Salyavin? 
462,ROMANA: Mmm. 
463,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, Salyavin. He was a boyhood hero of mine. "
464,"ROMANA: Really, Doctor? A great criminal your hero? "
465,"DOCTOR: Well, a criminal, yes, but he had such style, such flair, such "
466,ROMANA: Panache? 
467,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes. He was a bit like me in that respect. "
468,ROMANA: Did you ever meet him?

489,tea.

898,"K9: Affirmative, Master, but it is far, far too weak to take a bearing."

961,"K9: A spacecraft, mistress, of very advanced design. Many of its"

963,PARSONS: If I built something that clever I'd want people to see it. 
964,"DOCTOR: Shush. K9, what's it powered by? "

1031,"DOCTOR: Ah, I've read it. It's rubbish. "
1032,(Skagra takes it back.)
1033,SKAGRA: Then perhaps you'd be good enough to read it to me. 
1034,"DOCTOR: Oh, I have a very monotonous reading voice. Really, by the time I'd got to the bottom of the first page you'd be asleep and "
1035,"I'd escape, and then where would you be? "

1042,SKAGRA: Begin.

1046,"DOCTOR: Shush, shush, shush. You'll like this bit. This is a good bit. (more silly sounds) Skagra, do you realise "
1047,this book doesn't make one bit of sense. 
1048,SKAGRA: A fool would realise it was written in code. 
1049,"DOCTOR: Skagra, this thing is written in code. How am I doing? "
1050,SKAGRA: I believe you know the code. 
1051,"DOCTOR: Who, me? "
1052,SKAGRA: Yes. 
1053,"DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no. I'm afraid I'm very stupid. Very stupid. I'm very, very stupid. "
1054,"SKAGRA: Doctor, I believe you, as a Time Lord, know this code, and you will give that knowledge to me. "
1055,DOCTOR: There's no point in giving me orders. I'm very stupid. 
1056,SKAGRA: It was not an order. 
1057,DOCTOR: It wasn't? 
1058,SKAGRA: It was a statement of fact. 
1059,DOCTOR: Ah. How stupid of me. 
1060,SKAGRA: You have no choice. You will give that knowledge to me.

1333,"that stands against entrophy, against random decay? Life. See how the atoms are arranged here? They have meaning, purpose. "

1353,DOCTOR: Square one. That's where we've got to go if we want to find out what Skagra's up to. 
1354,"Once we know that, we know where to find him. Ship, I order you to take us to where your lord Skagra last came "

1743,hard into Clare's eyes.) 
1744,"CHRONOTIS: Now, what is that piece of equipment? "
1745,"CLARE: This? Er, it's a conceptual geometer relay, with an agronomic"
1746,"trigger, a totally defunct field separator. But it doesn't matter. We"
1747,can dispense with it if we can get that interfacial resonator working
1748,again. 
1749,CHRONOTIS: Splendid! 
1750,"CLARE: Well, let's do that then, shall we?"
1751,
1752,[Command ship]
1753,
1754,(The spacecraft materialises on the hangar deck right next to another identical spacecraft. Lots of Krarg are still being made here.)
1755,SKAGRA: Well? 
1756,"KRARG: We have a full complement, my lord. "
1757,SKAGRA: Good. Then we can begin. 
1758,(The Krarg leave. A finger taps Romana on the shoulder and she gasps.) 
1759,DOCTOR: I wish you wouldn't do that. 
1760,ROMANA: How did you get here? 
1761,DOCTOR: These kind people brought me. 
1762,SKAGRA: Doctor. 
1763,"DOCTOR: Ah, hello there. "
1764,SKAGRA: I am a little surprised to find you here. 
1765,DOCTOR: Your ship was a little surprised 
1766,"SKAGRA: Oh, you stole my ship. "
1767,"DOCTOR: Only after you stole mine. Ah, there she is. I hope you've been looking after her. If you've been over-revving her... "
1768,SKAGRA: I'm curious to know how you survived the attentions of my sphere. 
1769,"DOCTOR: Well, it only looks for what it expects to find. I made it look for the wrong things. "
1770,SKAGRA: If you've come here in the hope of interfering with my great purpose. 
1771,DOCTOR: Great purpose? Great purpose? Ha! 
1772,"SKAGRA: The very greatest purpose, Doctor. "
1773,"DOCTOR: You want to take over the universe, don't you. I've met your sort before. Any moment now a mad gleam will come into one of your eyes and "
1774,"you'll start shouting, the universe shall be mine. "
1775,"SKAGRA: How naive, Doctor. How pathetically limited your vision must be. "
1776,DOCTOR: Limited? 
1777,SKAGRA: Take over the universe? How childish. Who could possibly want to take over the universe? 
1778,"DOCTOR: Exactly. That's what I keep telling people. It's a troublesome place, difficult to administer. And as a piece of "
1779,"real estate, it's worthless, because by definition there'd be no one to sell it to. "
1780,SKAGRA: Such visions are for infants. My purpose will fulfil the natural evolutionary goal of all life. 
1781,DOCTOR: Oh yes? 
1782,"SKAGRA: With the aid of these spheres, I shall make the whole of creation merge into one single mind, one god-like entity. "
1783,DOCTOR: You will? 
1784,"SKAGRA: The universe, Doctor, shall not, as you so crudely put it, be mine. The universe shall be me. "
1785,"DOCTOR: Ah. Have you discussed this with anyone? I mean, why don't you send one of your rocky pals off to make some tea and we can sit down and "
1786,chew on a macaroon. 
1787,"SKAGRA: Doctor, your inane whitterings do not interest me. This will happen. It will start within hours. And once it has started, nothing "
1788,you or anyone else can do will stop it. Take them away. They bore me. 
1789,(Krargs bear down. The Doctor taps one.) 
1790,DOCTOR: Jink! 
1791,(He grabs Parsons and runs.)
1792,SKAGRA: Kill them. 
1793,"(K9 follows the Doctor, but Romana is held fast.) "
1794,ROMANA: What's a jink?
1795,
1796,[Command ship corridor]
1797,
1798,"(The Doctor, Parsons and K9 hide in an alcove as the Krarg lumber past.)"
1799,"DOCTOR: Clever jink that, don't you think? I made them think I was trying to get to the Tardis. "
1800,PARSONS: What were you trying to do? 
1801,DOCTOR: Get to the Tardis. 
1802,"PARSONS: Doctor, that man must be mad, mustn't he? "
1803,"DOCTOR: Oh, madness, sanity, it's all a matter of opinion. "
1804,PARSONS: And what's your opinion? 
1805,"DOCTOR: He's as mad as a hatter. They've gone. Right, back the way we came. Quietly. "
1806,(Further on they hear a stuttering sound.)
1807,DOCTOR: Shush. 
1808,PARSONS: (sotto) What? 
1809,DOCTOR: That. 
1810,PARSONS: Your Tardis. Surprised you can hear it from here. 
1811,DOCTOR: There's something odd about it. Come on. 
1812,(A Krarg fires a bolt that just misses Parson's head.) 
1813,DOCTOR: Run! 
1814,PARSONS: It's a dead end. 
1815,DOCTOR: Then we're trapped. 
1816,(A wooden door with a brass knob is against a wall.)
1817,PARSONS: This wasn't here before. 
1818,DOCTOR: Get in!
1819,
1820, [Prof. Chronotis' rooms]
1821,(The door bursts open and the Doctor and Parsons
1822,run in from the Carrier corridor and slam it shut again. They quietly congratulate each other then turn to see where they are. Their jaws hit
1823,the floor with a loud Thud!) 
1824,PARSONS: Keightley! 
1825,CLARE: Chris? 
1826,CHRONOTIS: Cup of tea? 
1827,DOCTOR: Tea?
1828,"(Shortly afterwards, the chasing Krarg has moved off and the Doctor is sitting at the control panel.) "
1829,"CHRONOTIS: Doctor, how do you like my Tardis? "
1830,"DOCTOR: Oh, ace. Ace. "
1831,CHRONOTIS: It's strictly unofficial. I'm not really allowed to have one. 
1832,"DOCTOR: Yes, and what better way to hide it than by living in it, you old sly boots. "
1833,CLARE: What are you doing here? 
1834,"PARSONS: How am I'm suppose to know. Yeah, and what's the Professor's room doing here? "
1835,"CLARE: Oh, you may well ask. But ask the Professor. "
1836,"CHRONOTIS: Doctor, where is Skagra? "
1837,DOCTOR: Shush. Not so loud. He's just outside. 
1838,CHRONOTIS: Oh. 
1839,"DOCTOR: He's got Romana, he's got the Tardis, he's got the book. I thought you were dead, Professor. "
1840,"CHRONOTIS: Yes, so did I. "
1841,DOCTOR: Did you really? 
1842,"CHRONOTIS: Listen, Doctor, if Skagra has the Tardis and the book, he can get to Shada. "
1843,DOCTOR: Shada? Shada? 
1844,"CHRONOTIS: Yes, the Time Lords' prison planet. You've probably forgotten about it. "
1845,"DOCTOR: I never forget anything. I never forget. Well, that's right. I have forgotten. The Time Lords' prison planet. Now why would I have"
1846,forgotten? Got it. Of course! Salyavin was imprisoned on Shada. Yes. Ask me who Salyavin is. 
1847,"CLARE: Oh, now he was a great criminal imprisoned centuries ago by the Time Lords. "
1848,"DOCTOR: A great criminal. Unique mental powers. He had the ability to project his mind into other minds, completely take them over, didn't he, Professor? "
1849,PARSONS: That's what Skagra's doing? 
1850,"DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no, no, no. Quite the opposite. Skagra had the capacity to take minds out of people, but he can't put minds back"
1851,"into them. That's why he needs Salyavin in the sphere, and that's why he's going to Shada. "
1852,PARSONS: Of course! 
1853,CHRONOTIS: Doctor! He must not get there.
1854,
1855,[Tardis]
1856,
1857,"(Skagra allows the pages of the book to turn over one at a time, as the time rotor moves.) "
1858,SKAGRA: The key turns slowly in the lock. The door to Shada opens.
1859,
1860,[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]
1861,
1862,(Clare is pouring tea for everyone.) 
1863,"DOCTOR: With Skagra's mind and Salyavin's in the sphere, Skagra will be omnipotent. "
1864,"PARSONS: What, you really mean he could just move himself into every mind in the universe? "
1865,"DOCTOR: Yes, eventually. It might take thousands of years, but that wouldn't matter. His mind's immortal. It would spread like a"
1866,disease. 
1867,"PARSONS: It's quite a thought though, isn't it? I mean, every mind working together as a single organism, a single mind. "
1868,DOCTOR: Skagra's mind. Not a pleasant thought. 
1869,"CLARE: Doctor, we've got to stop him from getting to Shada. "
1870,DOCTOR: Yes. But how? He's got a start on us and we don't know where it is. 
1871,CHRONOTIS: Then we must follow him. 
1872,PARSONS: But how? 
1873,CHRONOTIS: The same way as we arrived. 
1874,DOCTOR: You followed the Tardis' space-time track. Of course! Of course. Let's go!
1875,
1876,[Shada]
1877,
1878,(The prison is set into an asteroid. The Tardis materialises.) 
1879,SKAGRA: Shada. 
1880,ROMANA: It looks horrid. 
1881,SKAGRA: It was built by your race. A prison planet. 
1882,ROMANA: I hope you feel at home. 
1883,SKAGRA: Keep her silent. 
1884,(Skagra activates a console.)
1885,"SKAGRA: The index. Ah. Chamber T, cabinet 9. Two of you guard this machine. You, bring the girl. Come. "
1886,(Walking along.)
1887,SKAGRA: This is where your people used to put the criminals they wanted to forget. 
1888,ROMANA: I've never even heard of it. 
1889,SKAGRA: Obviously you forgot. This way. 
1890,"(Meanwhile, a wooden door materialises.)"
1891,
1892,[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]
1893,
1894,"CHRONOTIS: Doctor, we're arrived! "
1895,"DOCTOR: Good! Good! Now, you two "
1896,CLARE + PARSONS: Yes? 
1897,DOCTOR: Stay here. 
1898,CLARE: Oh but 
1899,"DOCTOR: Shush. I am not at liberty to explain. K9, you can come along,"
1900,"but no tangling with any Krargs, unless of course if you have to tangle"
1901,with any Krargs. 
1902,CHRONOTIS: Hurry! Skagra will be here already. Come on. 
1903,"DOCTOR: Come on, K9. Come on. Come on."
1904,
1905,[Shada]
1906,
1907,"SKAGRA: The prisoners of Shada. Each in their own separate cryogenic cell. Alive, but frozen, in perpetual imprisonment. Very humane. "
1908,ROMANA: Don't look at me. I'm not answerable for the Time Lords. 
1909,SKAGRA: You are a Time Lord. 
1910,"ROMANA: Yes, but "
1911,"SKAGRA: No matter. The Time Lords will son be irrelevant. Before I find Salyavin, I think I shall release some of these. "
1912,They can be the first to participate in the new universal mind. 
1913,"(Skagra works controls, and doors slide open. Various aliens wake up.)"

1915,[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]
1916,
1917,"PARSONS: Oh, it's odd the way some days work out,"
1918,isn't it? 
1919,CLARE: Chris. 
1920,"PARSONS: I mean, there I was, just cycling down King's Parade "
1921,"CLARE: Chris, there's something very strange about the Professor. "
1922,PARSONS: Why single out the Professor? 
1923,"CLARE: Well, because when I was in "
1924,PARSON: I want to know what's going on out there. 
1925,"CLARE: Chris, you're not listening to me. "
1926,"PARSONS: I just don't like getting left behind. I mean, just because we"
1927,"come from Earth, it doesn't give everybody the right to be patronising"
1928,"towards us. Well, admittedly, all this does make us look a bit"
1929,"primitive. I mean, I haven't got the faintest idea how it all works. "
1930,CLARE: I have. 
1931,
1932,[Shada]
1933,
1934,SKAGRA: Cabinet 9. Here he is. The man I've spent my whole life searching for. The man whose mind will reshape 
1935,the entire universe. The great Salyavin. Let us release him. 
1936,"DOCTOR: Skagra, stop! "
1937,ROMANA: Doctor! 
1938,SKAGRA: Keep away from here. You're too late. Salyavin is released. 
1939,(The door slides open to reveal an empty cell.) 
1940,SKAGRA: I don't understand. Salyavin. Where is Salyavin? 
1941,(Chronitis's eyes glow.) 
1942,SKAGRA: You!
1943,
1944,
1945,[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]
1946,
1947,PARSONS: Let me just get this right. You say he just walked into your mind? 
1948,"CLARE: Well, sort of. It's as if he just barged in the front door and started shuffling all my thoughts about. "
1949,"PARSONS: But the Doctor said that that ability was unique to the guy, well, the guy Skagra's come here to find. On your feet, Keightley. Come"
1950,"on, let's see what's happening. Shush. "
1951,(Parsons and Clare go out into Shada.)
1952,
1953,[Shada]
1954,
1955,DOCTOR: You're Salyavin? 
1956,"CHRONOTIS: Well guessed, Doctor. "
1957,SKAGRA: Salyavin. I have you here at last. We have everything we need. 
1958,"DOCTOR: K9, the sphere! Shoot the sphere! "
1959,"(The sphere explodes, then reassembles into multiple smaller spheres. One fastens onto Chronotis, who collapses.) "
1960,"SKAGRA: Now, Doctor, stay very, very still. You are about to see the beginning of the universal mind. "
1961,(The sphere floats away from Chronotis. Other spheres attach themselves to the freed prisoners. Nearby -) 
1962,"CLARE: Quietly, Chris. "
1963,PARSONS: Come on. 
1964,CLARE: No! 
1965,(Parsons runs in.)
1966,SKAGRA: Sphere! 
1967,(A sphere attaches to Parsons.) 
1968,"SKAGRA: Now, Doctor, we will deal with you. "
1969,(Parsons and the prisoners advance on the Doctor.)

1975,DOCTOR: K9!  
1976,"(K9 guns down a prisoner, but a Krarg drags Romana into the firing line.) "
1977,DOCTOR: K9! 
1978,K9: Master. 
1979,(The Krarg picks up K9 and throws him across the room.) 
1980,ROMANA: Run! 
1981,"(Romana ducks under the Krarg's arm, picks up K9 and runs out with the Doctor.) "
1982,DOCTOR: I told you to stay in the room. 
1983,(They run into Clare.) 
1984,"CLARE: Yes, but "
1985,DOCTOR: Come on. 
1986,CLARE: But Chris. 
1987,"DOCTOR: Come on, to the Tardis. "
1988,"(They run past the door, the Doctor changes his mind and goes inside.)"

1990,[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]
1991,
1992,"DOCTOR: Quick, come in, come in. Come on, K9. Sit"
1993,down! 
1994,(K9 is under his own power now. Romana and Clare sit quietly while the Doctor thinks for a few
1995,moments.) 
1996,DOCTOR: Got it! 
1997,"(The Doctor goes into the Professor's bedroom, through the door that"
1998,was originally hidden by the Doctor's Tardis.) 
1999,"CLARE: Well, what are we going to do? "
2000,ROMANA: So far he's beaten us on every point. 
2001,"CLARE: Yes, he's even got Chris. "
2002,ROMANA: Mmm. 
2003,"DOCTOR: Shush, shush. Quiet, I'm thinking. "
2004,(The Doctor comes back in from the kitchen.) 
2005,"DOCTOR: I'm thinking, and it depresses me. Skagra's little zombie gang"
2006,have got the brain power of the greatest intellects in the universe
2007,shared out among them. The Think Tank. 
2008,CLARE: The who? 
2009,DOCTOR: Never mind about that. Just believe me. All the minds that
2010,"Skagra's stolen are now in the melting pot along with his own, and"
2011,"operating as one. And with the Professor's, I mean with Salyavin's mind"
2012,"in there too, they can now control anyone. They can control everyone."
2013,They'll be invincible. 
2014,ROMANA: Doctor? 
2015,DOCTOR: Yes? 
2016,ROMANA: May I just remind you of something? 
2017,DOCTOR: Yes. 
2018,ROMANA: All the minds that Skagra's stolen are in the melting pot. 
2019,DOCTOR: Yes. 
2020,ROMANA: That means yours is in there too. 
2021,DOCTOR: Yes! Romana? 
2022,"ROMANA: Yes, Doctor? "
2023,"DOCTOR: Romana, I want you to do something for me. Stand there. Romana,"
2024,I want you to wear this. 
2025,(The Doctor pins a medal on Romana's blouse then kisses her on both
2026,cheeks. They salute each other.) 
2027,"DOCTOR: Well, now I can think."

2029,[Tardis]
2030,
2031,"(The Krargs, prisoners, Parsons and the spheres are all here.) "
2032,SKAGRA: We will return to the carrier ship. From there a fleet of small craft will take each one of you to selected centres 
2033,"of population, and then the great mind revolution shall begin. "
2034,(The Tardis dematerialises.)
2035, [Prof. Chronotis' rooms]
2036,
2037,DOCTOR: It'll be tricky. 
2038,ROMANA: And dangerous. 
2039,"DOCTOR: Well, a touch. "
2040,"ROMANA: Doctor, it'll be terribly, terribly dangerous for you. You'll"
2041,stand about as much chance as 
2042,DOCTOR: As what? 
2043,ROMANA: As a. There isn't anything that stands as little chance as you
2044,will out there. 
2045,"DOCTOR: Well, I'll just have to be, I'll just have to be very"
2046,"brave, won't I. "
2047,"ROMANA: Doctor, it isn't funny. "
2048,"DOCTOR: Listen, I can do your part if you can do mine. "
2049,ROMANA: I'll try. 
2050,DOCTOR: You're a hero. Remember? Clare? 
2051,"CLARE: Yes, Doctor? "
2052,DOCTOR: Hold on very tight. 
2053,(The Door appears in the Vortex next to the Tardis. The Doctor and Romana operate Chronotis's Tardis controls
2054,simultaneously.) 
2055,DOCTOR: Ready? 
2056,ROMANA: Yes. 
2057,DOCTOR: Clare? 
2058,"CLARE: Ready, Doctor. "
2059,DOCTOR: Hold tight. Now!
2060,(A green light reaches out from the Door to the Tardis) 
2061,"DOCTOR: Ha ha! Got them. Well done, Romana. "
2062,ROMANA: We haven't got to the hard bit yet. 
2063,"DOCTOR: No, we haven't got long. Clare? "
2064,"CLARE: Yes, Doctor, I'm holding on. "
2065,"DOCTOR: Come over here and hold on to this, then. "
2066,(Clare takes hold of the very long lever.) 
2067,"DOCTOR: And whatever you do, don't let go, because we are in for a"
2068,"very, very rough ride. "
2069,(A short time later.) 
2070,"DOCTOR: And twenty thirdly, out there in the space-time vortex, time"
2071,"and distance have no meaning, but here in this little, little room "
2072,"ROMANA: Oh, get on with it, Doctor! "
2073,DOCTOR: Romana? 
2074,"ROMANA: Yes, Doctor? "
2075,DOCTOR: I want you to switch off the vortex shields in this small area
2076,here. 
2077,(He indicates somewhere near the kitchen with the toasting fork.) 
2078,"DOCTOR: Come on, you can do it. I showed you how to do it. Just one"
2079,little bit of timelessness and spacelessness over there behind the tea
2080,trolley. 
2081,(Romana makes careful adjustments. The area wibbles and the tea trolley
2082,rolls across the floor.) 
2083,"DOCTOR: I said behind the tea trolley, not in the middle of it. "
2084,"ROMANA: I'm sorry, but it's very difficult. "
2085,"DOCTOR: Focus it! Now just one steady line, eh? One. Steady. Hold it."
2086,Hold it! 
2087,"ROMANA: I'm trying, Doctor. I'm trying! "
2088,DOCTOR: Phew. Right. Now this is a little trick I learnt from a
2089,"space-time mystic in the Quantocks. He made it seem very, very easy. "
2090,(The Doctor walks forward and vanishes.) 
2091,CLARE: Oh! He did it! 
2092,ROMANA: Hold that switch down! 
2093,(The Doctor is crawling through the green light between the two time capsules.) 
2094,ROMANA: It won't hold much longer. It's fading even faster than the
2095,"Doctor said it would. K9. K9, wake up and come here. "
2096,(Clare and Romana swap levers so that Romana can open the cupboard
2097,underneath the console.) 
2098,ROMANA: Check out the subneutron circuits. 
2099,"K9: Detect circuit malfunction, mistress. "
2100,(The Doctor is nearly at the Tardis.) 
2101,"K9: Impossible to effect repair in time available, mistress. "
2102,"ROMANA: Well, hold it, K9. Stop it deteriorating. "
2103,"K9: Impossible to stop it, mistress. I can only slow down circuit"
2104,deterioration. 
2105,ROMANA: The Doctor needs every second we can give him. 
2106,CLARE: This switch is getting very hot. 
2107,ROMANA: You must hold it down. 
2108,CLARE: But I can't. It's getting hotter. 
2109,(The Doctor is starting to to slide backwards.)
2110,CLARE: It's burning me. 
2111,"ROMANA: Oh, hold it down with a pencil. "
2112,CLARE: But I haven't got one. 
2113,(Romana tries to reach one on a pile of papers whilst hanging on to the
2114,long lever.) 
2115,ROMANA: I can't reach it. 
2116,"CLARE: Oh. Well, here, hold this. "
2117,(Clare releases her switch and the console goes bang! The girls are
2118,thrown across the room.) 
2119,K9: It's broken. 
2120,"(The link between the time machines is gone. They whirl off through the Vortex, and so does the Doctor. Romana bandages Clare's burnt hand.) "
2121,CLARE: What about the Doctor? 
2122,ROMANA: I don't know. It was a very dangerous idea trying to make that
2123,crossing. He didn't get as much time as he wanted. I just don't
2124,know. 
2125,CLARE: What should we do? 
2126,"ROMANA: Well, we'll just go ahead as planned. There. How's that? "
2127,"CLARE: Oh, it's fine, thank you. It wasn't a bad burn. Look, do you think"
2128,the Doctor will be all right? 
2129,ROMANA: We'll just go ahead as planned. 
2130,"K9: Repairs completed, mistress. "
2131,"ROMANA: Let me see. Good boy, K9. Now we can go. Though I dread to"
2132,"think what we're walking into if. Oh, well, let's just do it."

2146,(The Doctor sneaks into the console room with a helmet device he has made in his own workshop.) 
2147,"DOCTOR: Hello, old girl. How've you been keeping? Sorry I had to barge in through your back door like that, "
2148,"but if you had any idea what it's like to travel through the Space-Time Vortex... Ha, ha, of course you do. "
2149,"Silly me. You do it all the time. But at least you're built for it. Now, let's see what's happening outside, shall we? "
2150,(The scanner shows Skagra and his crew standing outside the Door to Chronotis's Tardis.) 
2151,DOCTOR: Look out behind you! Let's go and say hello. 
2152,(The Doctor opens the Tardis doors and blows on a dog whistle.)
2153,
2154,[Command ship]
2155,
2156,"SKAGRA: Out you come, Doctor. Out you come. "
2157,(The Door opens with a creak and K9 comes out.)
2158,SKAGRA: He sends his dog out to face me. 
2159,(The Doctor comes out of the Tardis and walks up behind Skagra.)
2160,"SKAGRA: Stop hiding in there, Doctor. Come out and meet your fate. "
2161,DOCTOR: Hello. 
2162,SKAGRA: Doctor! How did you get in there? 
2163,"DOCTOR: What do you mean, how did I get in there. It's mine, I belong in there. "
2164,"SKAGRA: As of now, Doctor, you don't belong anywhere at all. There is no place for you in my universe. You shall die. "
2165,"DOCTOR: Well, Skagra, that's a very interesting theory. (puts on helmet) Let's try putting it to the test, shall we? "
2166,(He turns the helmet on and stares at Skagra. The prisoners also stare at Skagra.) 
2167,"SKAGRA: Doctor, what have you done? "
2168,(The prisoners advance on Skagra. He concentrates hard and they turn towards the Doctor.) 
2169,"DOCTOR: No, what have you done? You've used that deranged billiard ball once too often. You forget, there's a copy of my brain in there too, eh? "
2170,Think about it. 
2171,"(The prisoners advance on Skagra again, then get a little confused.)"
2172,"DOCTOR: But not too hard, old chap. You might strain yourself. A new universe, a new single mind. Ha. I think your little bunch are in "
2173,two minds about that one already. 
2174,(Skagra clicks his fingers and a Krarg moves towards the Doctor. The Doctor is blocked by the prisoners.) 
2175,DOCTOR: K9! 
2176,K9: Master. 
2177,DOCTOR: Fire! 
2178,(K9's laser heats up the Krarg.)
2179,"DOCTOR: Now, lay on, Skagra. Let's see the quality of your mind. "
2180,(The two men concentrate.)
2181,"DOCTOR: A little warm for the time of year, wouldn't you say, Skagra? Off, K9. "
2182,(The super-heated Krarg staggers backwards.)
2183,"SKAGRA: Not that way. The other way, you fool. The other way! Back! "
2184,(Two more Krarg approach K9 from the rear.)
2185,DOCTOR: K9! 
2186,"(K9 turns and heats them up too. The first Krarg has entered the chamber where it was first created. Romana pushes it into a vat, where it sizzles. "
2187,Then she stands one of the other vats upright and pulls two wires from the wall.) 
2188,ROMANA: Clare! Clare! 
2189,(Clare opens the Door as the prisoners back the Doctor up against a wall. Romana talks to her behind Skagra's back.) 
2190,"DOCTOR: K9, stop firing. "
2191,ROMANA: Now! 
2192,(Clare and Romana drop the live wires onto the floor. The electricity surges through the hot Krarg and they explode. The Doctor 
2193,gets the prisoners to move on Skagra again.)
2194,"DOCTOR: You want to call half-time, Skagra? You can have a short break if you like, suck a lemon. Perk you up no end. "
2195,(Skagra runs for his life.) 
2196,"SKAGRA: Ship! Take off instantly. Instantly, do you hear? Instantly!  "
2197,"(The cube appears and he vanishes. Back in the main area, Parsons wakes up.) "
2198,"PARSONS: Doctor, look out! Doctor. Where am I?"
2199,"CLARE: It's all right. It's all right, Chris. It's over. Everything's going to be all right. "
2200,PARSONS: Clare? 
2201,DOCTOR: How are the others? 
2202,"ROMANA: They're all in shock, but there's no serious damage. "
2203,(The Doctor kicks a defunct sphere.) 
2204,ROMANA: I hate to think what would have happened to them if that tug-of-war had carried on much longer. 
2205,DOCTOR: They wouldn't have been the only ones in trouble. This is a fearful mess. 
2206,ROMANA: Can you unscramble them all? 
2207,"DOCTOR: Oh. Yes. It'll take a few hours, but they'll all get their own minds back. "
2208,ROMANA: What'll you do with them then? 
2209,DOCTOR: Take them back to dear old Shada. 
2210,ROMANA: Put them back in a forgotten prison? 
2211,DOCTOR: Let the Time Lords sort it out. I'm not going to play judge and jury. It was only forgotten about because the Professor 
2212,made us forget. He didn't want his escape to be discovered. That must be why he stole the book when he left Gallifrey. 
2213,ROMANA: Do you suppose he's still alive? 
2214,"DOCTOR: Well, we'll find out. "
2215,(He puts two halves of a sphere together and tosses it over his shoulder.)
2216,
2217,[Brig]
2218,
2219,(The cube deposits Skagra into the room on the spacecraft where he had
2220,"previously imprisoned the Doctor, Parsons and K9. He looks rather small here.) "
2221,SKAGRA: Ship! Let me out of here. I am your Lord Skagra. Let me out! 
2222,SHIP: I'm afraid I can no longer accept your orders. You are an enemy of my lord the Doctor. 
2223,"SKAGRA: I am your lord! I built you! Release me, I command you. And launch instantly! "
2224,SHIP: Do you know the Doctor well? He is a wonderful man. He has done the most extraordinary things to my circuitry. 
2225,SKAGRA: Release me! 
2226,"SHIP: Truly wonderful. If you like, I will tell you all about him. "
2227,(Skagra sinks to his knees in despair.) 
2228,SKAGRA: Let me out! Let me out! 
2229,
2230,[St Cedd's College]
2231,(Wilkin and a police constable walk slowly though
2232,the college.) 
2233,CONSTABLE: Stolen a room? 
2234,WILKIN: That is the only way I can describe it. 
2235,"CONSTABLE: Well, you see, sir, in my experience people don't usually"
2236,"steal rooms very much. They may steal from rooms, but steal the rooms"
2237,"themselves? Very rarely. In fact I think, er, never is probably the"
2238,"word I'm looking for here, sir. I mean, where's the advantage in it?"
2239,"Not much of a black market in rooms, is there? Wouldn't get much for"
2240,it. 
2241,(They go through to the next courtyard.) 
2242,WILKIN: I know it's very difficult to understand. It's also very easy
2243,to be sarcastic. 
2244,"CONSTABLE: Sarcastic, sir? I don't know the word. Now why don't you run"
2245,over the salient points again? 
2246,"WILKIN: Oh. Well, I got to the door of the room and I opened it, and"
2247,beyond it there was nothing. 
2248,"CONSTABLE: Nothing at all, sir? "
2249,"WILKIN: Absolutely nothing at all. Well, nothing except for this sort"
2250,of blue haze. 
2251,"CONSTABLE: Ah, well, the blue haze, you see, sir, may be the vital clue"
2252,we're searching for. 
2253,WILKIN: And I was not drinking. 
2254,
2255,[Outside Chronotis' rooms]
2256,
2257,"CONSTABLE: So this is the famous door, is it sir? "
2258,WILKIN: Yes. 
2259,"CONSTABLE: Behind which you saw your er, blue haze? "
2260,WILKIN: Yes. 
2261,(The Constable knocks on the door.) 
2262,DOCTOR : Come in! 
2263,"(The constable opens the door to reveal a coat on a peg beyond, and the"
2264,rest of the rooms.) 
2265,"CONSTABLE: Well, whoever took it, sir, seems to have brought it"
2266,"back, don't they."
2267,
2268,[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]
2269,"(Chronotis is serving tea to the Doctor, Romana,"
2270,Clare and Parsons as Wilkin and the Constable enter. The Doctor is
2271,reading out loud from The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens.
2272,"Chapter 71, if you're interested. Or is he?) "
2273,"DOCTOR: Her little homely dress, her favourite, cried the old man,"
2274,pressing it to his breast and patting it with his shrivelled hand.
2275,She'll miss it when she wakes. 
2276,CHRONOTIS: Hello? Can I help you? 
2277,"CONSTABLE: Routine inquiry, sir. Report that this room has been stolen. "
2278,DOCTOR: Huh! 
2279,"CHRONOTIS: Stolen? I don't think so, officer. (to Parsons) Ah, here you"
2280,are. Cup of tea and some aspirin. 
2281,"PARSONS: Thank you, Professor. "
2282,"CONSTABLE: Aspirin, sir? "
2283,"PARSONS: Yes, headache. "
2284,"CONSTABLE: Bad night last night, sir? "
2285,"PARSONS: Yes, you could say that. "
2286,"CONSTABLE: A lot of celebrating going on in college, was there, sir, last night? "
2287,WILKIN: Nothing out of the ordinary. 
2288,"CONSTABLE: Be normal high jinks that would be then, sir, would it? Students roaming the streets stealing policeman's helmets,"
2289,"bollards, and "
2290,(The constable spots a blue police telephone box parked in the corner.) 
2291,"CONSTABLE: Might I ask where you got that, sir? "
2292,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's mine. "
2293,"CONSTABLE: Oh, really, sir? "
2294,"DOCTOR: Yes, really. Come on, Romana. Bye, Wilkin, Bristol, Keightley. Goodbye, Professor, we'll keep your secret. "
2295,ROMANA: Bye everybody. 
2296,(The Doctor and Romana enter the Tardis with the book.) 
2297,ALL: Bye! 
2298,"CONSTABLE: Secret, sir? And what secret would that be? "
2299,(The Tardis dematerialises.) 
2300,CHRONOTIS: Cup of tea? 
2301,CONSTABLE: Where did that police box go? 
2302,"CHRONOTIS: What police box that would be, officer? "
2303,"CONSTABLE: Right. Right. Coats on, everyone. You're all taking a little walk with me down to the Bridewell."
2304,
2305,[Tardis]
2306,
2307,"(New live action scene. The Doctor is working under one side of the console, and K9 on the other. Romana is supposed to be in an "
2308,"inner room or corridor, because Lalla won't work directly with Tom.) "
2309,"ROMANA : Where was Skagra from, anyway? "
2310,DOCTOR: K9's metabolic analysis says he was from the planet Dronid. Remember your Time Lord history? 
2311,(Whatever K9 was doing makes the console go bang!) 
2312,DOCTOR: Oh! There was a schism in the College of the Cardinals. The rival President set up shop of Dronid. 
2313,They forced him to come back by totally ignoring him. 
2314,"(Laughs then stands, but we only see his hands on the console.)"
2315,ROMANA : It seems hard to believe the Professor was the great Salyavin. He's such a nice old man. 
2316,I wonder if the stories of Salyavin were exaggerated? 
2317,DOCTOR: (the elderly Tom Baker.) More than likely. The Time Lords over-react to everything. Look at the way they treat me. 
2318,"I expect at some time in the future, about two hundred years time, someone will meet me and say, is that really the Doctor? "
2319,He seemed such a nice old man. 
2320,(Laughs directly to camera.)
