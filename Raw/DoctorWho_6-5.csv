23, COMPUTER: Bombay Tokyo shipment activated. Bombay
24,sending now. Tokyo receiving now. Dispatch completed. New York to
25,Moscow delayed. Moonbase clearance awaited. Stockholm Washington
26,personnel transportation. Stockholm sending now. Washington receiving
27,now. Dispatch completed. Non-arrival shipment of synthetic protein New
28,York to Moscow. Moonbase clearance awaited. 
29,KELLY: Brent? 
30,"BRENT: Yes, Miss Kelly? "
31,KELLY: Why is there a delay at Moon Control? 
32,BRENT: There's some mix up with the Moscow shipment. It seems to have
33,landed up in Canberra. 
34,"KELLY: Fewsham again, I suppose? Take Moscow out of phase while they"
35,sort it out. 
36,BRENT: Moscow pending. Moonbase clear. 
37,COMPUTER: Toronto Calcutta shipment activated. Toronto sending now.
38,Calcutta receiving now. Dispatch completed. 
39,"BRENT: Moscow ready now, Miss Kelly. "
40,"KELLY: Report Canberra Moscow situation, please. "
41,COMPUTER: Canberra Moscow clear. 
42,"KELLY: Brent, tell them to activate. "
43,"BRENT: Canberra Moscow, go ahead please. "
44,COMPUTER: Canberra sending now. Moscow receiving now. Dispatch
45,completed. 
46,(A man beams into a teleport cubicle and there is a chime. He strides
47,across the floor swinging his briefcase.) 
48,"OSGOOD: Good morning, Gia. "
49,KELLY: Morning. Just as well you've arrived. 
50,"OSGOOD: Why, what's up? "
51,"KELLY: The sooner you take over from Fewsham on Moon Control, the"
52,better. 
53,"OSGOOD: Oh, not again! "
54,KELLY: All T-Mat consignments are five minutes behind schedule. 
55,OSGOOD: What? 
56,KELLY: Fewsham routed a large Moscow consignment through to Canberra. 
57,"OSGOOD: Oh, he's a lunatic. "
58,KELLY: You should never have recommended him for an Assistant
59,Controller's job in the first place. 
60,"OSGOOD: Yes, I know now, but I thought he deserved a break. "
61,KELLY: Sentimental. He'll do something really disastrous one day and
62,you'll have to answer for it. 
63,"OSGOOD: So, I'll go and work in a synthetics factory. "
64,KELLY: It's your career. 
65,"OSGOOD: So it is. Hey, have you got a T-Mat cubicle ready for me? "
66,KELLY: Yes. Number six. 
67,OSGOOD: See you later. 
68,(Osgood steps into another cubicle.) 
69,KELLY: Prepare lunar cubicle number six for transport to Moon Control. 
70,BRENT: Ready and waiting. 
71,(Osgood blows Kelly a kiss.) 
72,KELLY: Activate. 
73,(Osgood vanishes.) 
74,BRENT: It's lucky he got here before your man arrived. 
75,"KELLY: Yes, he's late. Keep a public T-Mat cubicle open for him. "
76,BRENT: Right. Local cubicle two holding open. 
77,KELLY: Report Moonbase situation please. 
78,COMPUTER: Moonbase clear. Routine shipments transferring on automatic
79,control. Local arrival cubicle two activating. 
80,(A silver-haired man steps out.) 
81,"RADNOR: Morning, Brent. "
82,"BRENT: Morning, sir. "
83,"RADNOR: Good morning, Gia. All functioning well? "
84,"KELLY: Of course, Commander Radnor. "
85,"RADNOR: In your case, Miss Kelly, efficiency and charm go hand in hand."
86,
87,KELLY: I try to keep things running smoothly. 
88,RADNOR: Nothing ever goes wrong while you're on duty. 
89,KELLY: I don't allow it. 
90,(Radnor goes into his office.)
91,
92, [T Mat Moonbase Control]
93,
94," OSGOOD: You may have been on duty all night,"
95,"Fewsham, but that's no excuse for this kind of slip-up! "
96,"FEWSHAM: They weren't a major hold ups, just a few minutes. "
97,OSGOOD: Kelly was going mad back on Earth Control. 
98,FEWSHAM: She would. 
99,"OSGOOD: Look, I'm sorry, Fewsham, but it's my head in the noose as"
100,"well, you know. "
101,"FEWSHAM: I know, I'm sorry. "
102,"OSGOOD: Oh, all right. All right, go on. You'd better get back to"
103,Earth. 
104,"(Fewsham goes to a cubicle, but an alarm sounds.) "
105,OSGOOD: Now what? 
106,FEWSHAM: The outer door airlocks. 
107,OSGOOD: Who's there? 
108,FEWSHAM: No one. 
109,OSGOOD: Then how come the airlocks are in use? 
110,(A man screams just outside the control room. Osgood and Fewsham open
111,the doors and he falls into their arms.) 
112,"OSGOOD: Phipps! What is it, man? What's happened? Come on, man! "
113,(Another scream and two more men run in.) 
114,"LOCKE: Close the doors, we've got to keep "
115,(But what is in the corridor makes them freeze in fear.) 
116,"OSGOOD: Don't move, anybody. Don't do anything. Harvey, don't! "
117,(The light of a weapon kills Harvey.)
118,
119, [T-Mat Earth Control]
120,
121, (The Delay light is blinking.) 
122,BRENT: Not again. 
123,KELLY: The second Moscow consignment? 
124,BRENT: Yes. They'll think we're deliberately sabotaging their stuff if
125,this goes on. 
126,"KELLY: T-Mat reception, Earth to Moon. Controller Kelly calling. Switch"
127,your communication links to video. 
128,(The video screen is blank.) 
129,KELLY: Osgood's gone too far this time. There'll be trouble. 
130,
131, [T Mat Moonbase Control]
132,
133, OSGOOD: No! I refuse! 
134,"(The unseen visitor speaks with a harsh, hissing voice.) "
135,"SLAAR: You would be wise to co-operate at once, otherwise you will be"
136,destroyed. 
137,"OSGOOD: Well I, I suppose that leaves me no alternative. "
138,"PHIPPS: Don't do it, sir. "
139,SLAAR: Silence. 
140,OSGOOD: There's a certain element of risk. 
141,SLAAR: You are wasting time. 
142,(Osgood operates some switches under the video screen. Smoke starts
143,pouring out of the sides.) 
144,SLAAR: What is happening? 
145,OSGOOD: I'm afraid there has been a fault. The circuit's overloaded.
146,Very unfortunate. 
147,SLAAR: You have deliberately sabotaged this apparatus. Kill him. 
148,(Osgood turns and gets shot with the alien weapon.)
149,
150, [T Mat Earth Control]
151,
152, RADNOR: I thought the system was infallible? 
153,KELLY: It won't be anything serious. 
154,RADNOR: I'm glad you think so. 
155,"KELLY: Brent, is there any obvious damage? "
156,BRENT: No damage reported. All links stable. 
157,"RADNOR: That's only local, surely. "
158,KELLY: It's only one stage of the checking process. Report on Intercity
159,T-Mat breakdown. 
160,COMPUTER: Complete power phase blank. 
161,KELLY: State of materialisation pulse generator? 
162,COMPUTER: Overloaded in power surge. No damage this end. 
163,KELLY: Check with Moonbase. 
164,COMPUTER: Primary video link dead. 
165,KELLY: Cause? 
166,COMPUTER: Being investigated. 
167,RADNOR: Are you sure it isn't serious? 
168,KELLY: My staff are running a thorough and immediate check. Until I
169,"have their report, I can't answer. "
170,RADNOR: Then they'd better hurry. I want that report. Soon.
171,
172,[Tardis]
173,
174, (The Tardis is making materialisation sounds.) 
175,"ZOE: Doctor, if we've landed, where are we? "
176,"DOCTOR: That is what I'm trying to find out, Zoe. "
177,(The scanner picks up - ) 
178,ZOE: A rocket? 
179,"JAMIE: Hey, we're just hanging in space. "
180,DOCTOR: We can't be. 
181,"ZOE: Well, let's try and find a star we know. "
182,(The scanner image swings round to a CCCP space suit.) 
183,DOCTOR: Ah there we are. What in heavens name? 
184,"JAMIE: Hey, what's he up to? "
185,ZOE: He's trying to climb aboard. 
186,"DOCTOR: Just a minute, just a minute. Oh this control is. There we are."
187,"Now that, that's an ion-jet rocket of the twenty first century, but,"
188,"this helmet, if I can. There we are. That's not nearly so"
189,sophisticated. It's certainly not later than 1960. 
190,"JAMIE: Well, those letters on his helmet? "
191,ZOE: C C C P. 
192,JAMIE: Aye. 
193,DOCTOR: Of course! 
194,JAMIE: What? 
195,DOCTOR: Just a minute. 
196,"(The Doctor gets the scanner to turn in the opposite direction, and"
197,reveals an old document with backwards writing on it.) 
198,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think that explains it. "
199,"ZOE: Oh Doctor, what is it? "
200,"DOCTOR: Hmm? Well it's a flying machine, designed by a gentleman by the"
201,name of Leonardo Da Vinci in about 1500. 
202,"JAMIE: Well, what's it doing up here? "
203,"ZOE: Doctor, where are we? "
204,JAMIE: Aye. 
205,DOCTOR: We're in a museum! 
206,JAMIE: A what? 
207,"DOCTOR: A space museum! Look, there you are. "
208,"(Wright Brothers airplane, capsule with an astronaut taking a tethered"
209,"space walk, Montgolfier's balloon) "
210,DOCTOR: A balloon. 
211,"(A Spitfire, a HOTOL style American Airlines plane.) "
212,"DOCTOR: That's a transport plane. And, now those initials, they stand"
213,"for Russia. That's Gagarin, the first Earthman in space. Look. "
214,"(A rocket launch, TravelMat Relay over an image of the Moon.) "
215,"DOCTOR: Come on. Let's have a look round, shall we? "
216,(Jamie and Zoe Leave the Tardis. The Doctor turns back for his jacket.)
217,
218,DOCTOR: Just a minute. Wait for me.
219,
220, [Space museum]
221,
222,(Exhibits include the Astral map from the  Web
223,Planet.) 
224,"JAMIE: Hey, quite a place, isn't it? "
225,"DOCTOR: Oh, my word. "
226,"JAMIE: Hey, look at the size of this one, Doc. "
227,"DOCTOR: Yes. My word, Jamie, look at that. "
228,"ZOE: Oh Doctor, look! "
229,DOCTOR: Very large. 
230,"ZOE: Doctor, look. "
231,(The rocket model they first saw on the scanner. 
232,"JAMIE: Hey, look at that. "
233,(Zoe presses a button on a panel.) 
234,"DOCTOR: Now, Zoe. "
235,(There is a chime.) 
236,JAMIE: What's that? 
237,"(A screen drops down on the wall behind them, and an information video"
238,plays.) 
239,MAN : Travel Mat is the ultimate form of travel. Control centre of
240,"the present system is the Moon, serving receptions at all major cities"
241,on the Earth. Travel Mat provides an instantaneous means of public
242,"travel, transports raw materials and vital food supplies to all parts"
243,of the world. 
244,JAMIE: Travel Mat? It sounds like a flying carpet. 
245,"DOCTOR: Shush, Jamie, I'm trying to listen. "
246,MAN : Travel Mat supersedes all conventional forms of transport.
247,"Using the principle of dematerialisation at the point of departure, and"
248,"rematerialisation at the point of arrival in special cubicles,"
249,departure and arrival are almost instantaneous. 
250,ZOE: Faster than light. 
251,"MAN : Although the system is still in its early stages, it"
252,completely automated and foolproof against power failure. 
253,"JAMIE: Aye, well, we have our own system, thank you, only it isn't"
254,foolproof. 
255,"DOCTOR: Jamie, I think that's just a tiny bit "
256,(The Doctor turns and raises his hands in surrender to the weapon
257,pointed at him. Jamie and Zoe do likewise.)
258,
259, [T Mat Moonbase Control] 
260, SLAAR: You saw what happened to your superior. You
261,would do well to co-operate. 
262,FEWSHAM: Killing him didn't do you any good. 
263,SLAAR: But you will do as I ask. 
264,FEWSHAM: There is nothing I can do! 
265,SLAAR: You do not want to die? 
266,"FEWSHAM: Look, I'm not that good enough a technician. It needs an"
267,expert. 
268,SLAAR: But you are second in command here. 
269,"FEWSHAM: Yes, but "
270,SLAAR: Then you must have certain abilities. You must know what needs
271,to be done. 
272,"FEWSHAM: In theory, yes. "
273,SLAAR: Then you will do it. 
274,PHIPPS: He'll only make it worse. 
275,SLAAR: What is their status here? 
276,FEWSHAM: Maintenance. Second class technicians. 
277,"LOCKE: There's only one person who can really put things to rights, and"
278,she's at Earth Control. 
279,"PHIPPS: Without her, it just can't be done. "
280,SLAAR: Who is this specialist? 
281,"FEWSHAM: Miss Kelly, technical coordinator. But there's no way to reach"
282,her. T-Mat is not working. 
283,SLAAR: But you have a video link. 
284,"FEWSHAM: Yes, but Osgood wrecked that too. "
285,"SLAAR: So, there is no means to communicate with Earth? "
286,"PHIPPS: No, you've cut us off completely. "
287,"SLAAR: In that case, you are useless. You will all be destroyed. "
288,"FEWSHAM: No, there's the emergency T-Mat link! It only operates from"
289,here to Earth. 
290,SLAAR: Then you will activate the apparatus. At once. 
291,(Fewsham hurries to the controls.) 
292,"FEWSHAM: It's damaged, too! "
293,SLAAR: These technicians will help you repair it. 
294,PHIPPS: We won't help you. Neither will he. 
295,SLAAR: Then he will die. You will start work at once. There will be a
296,guard at the door. When I return you will have the T-mat link ready for
297,operation. 
298,"(Slaar, who we have not yet seen, leaves.) "
299,"PHIPPS: Don't be such a fool, Fewsham. If we repair the emergency link"
300,these creatures can travel to Earth! 
301,FEWSHAM: What about us? 
302,PHIPPS: Do you think that will make any difference in the end? As soon
303,"as he gets what he wants out of us, we'll mean nothing to him. "
304,FEWSHAM: If we co-operate there's still a chance. 
305,PHIPPS: Osgood didn't take it. 
306,FEWSHAM: You saw! Do you think I want to die like that? I want to live!
307,
308, [T Mat Earth Control]
309,
310," KELLY: Brent, is there anything at all, any trace"
311,of a reason? 
312,BRENT: Every link has been double-checked. This end is functioning
313,normally. 
314,KELLY: Then it must be Moonbase. 
315,"BRENT: We've no way of checking their apparatus from this end, and they"
316,don't answer our call. 
317,KELLY: Where's Commander Radnor? 
318,BRENT: Not back from the Intercity Council meeting yet. 
319,KELLY: He'll expect a full report. 
320,"BRENT: Well, there it is. We've even checked the computer. "
321,(Brent gives Kelly a piece of paper and leaves.) 
322,RADNOR: Have you located the cause of the breakdown? 
323,KELLY: This end is absolutely clear. 
324,RADNOR: That isn't what I want to know. 
325,KELLY: We cannot trace the fault. 
326,RADNOR: Miss Kelly! I have senior government officials hounding me.
327,"They expect a more informative answer, and so do I. "
328,KELLY: There isn't one. The trouble is at Moonbase. 
329,RADNOR: Why can't you deal with it? 
330,KELLY: We can't get there. 
331,BRENT: We can't even talk to them. 
332,RADNOR: Do you mean to tell me that there's no other way of contacting
333,them? 
334,BRENT: No. 
335,KELLY: Only by rocket. 
336,RADNOR: That could be our only answer. 
337,BRENT: But the only place you'll find a rocket is in a museum. 
338,RADNOR: Exactly. 
339,"KELLY: And even if there was one that could be made operational,"
340,there's no-one that could control such a project. 
341,"RADNOR: You're wrong. There is just one man, one man alone who can help"
342,us now.
343,
344, [Space museum]
345,
346, (The weapon is held by an elderly man with a
347,quilted body-warmer over his clothes.) 
348,"ELDRED: For the last time, who are you and what are you doing in my"
349,private workshop? 
350,"DOCTOR: Now just listen, there really is no need for all these"
351,histrionics. We are perfectly harmless. 
352,ELDRED: How did you even get in here? 
353,"DOCTOR: Oh well, the usual way. We just materialised. "
354,"ELDRED: The T-Mat cubicle always gives automatic warnings, but it"
355,didn't this time. 
356,"ZOE: Well that's not our fault, is it? "
357,ELDRED: Why did you come? 
358,"DOCTOR: Well, this is a museum. "
359,ELDRED: The museum is (sees the Tardis) What on Earth's that? It's a
360,"twentieth century Police Box, isn't it? "
361,"DOCTOR: Well, yes, in a way. "
362,"ELDRED: Well, how did a thing like that get in my museum? "
363,"ZOE: Oh, well you could say it was a form of space ship. "
364,"DOCTOR: Zoe, I think we do owe this gentleman an apology. We really are"
365,"most interested in the museum, Mister? "
366,"ELDRED: Eldred, Professor Eldred. Look, the museum is closed to the"
367,general public. You've obviously made a mistake. Perhaps you'd be good
368,enough to leave. 
369,JAMIE: Are you in charge of this place? 
370,ELDRED: I own it. That is why I have the right to ask you to leave. 
371,"DOCTOR: Yes, but there's no need to threaten us, you know. "
372,ELDRED: Trespassers are not welcome. Will you please go! 
373,ZOE: We're not trespassers. We're very interested. 
374,ELDRED: Interested? In Professor Eldred and his antiquated machines?
375,"Come for a good laugh, I suppose, like the rest of them. "
376,"DOCTOR: Laugh? You mean people laugh at all this? Why, it's a"
377,magnificent exhibition. 
378,"ELDRED: We've had enough souvenir hunters, too! "
379,"JAMIE: Now, we're not thieves, you know. "
380,"DOCTOR: No, of course not. We haven't come to take anything. We"
381,"genuinely are interested in space travel. Why, especially a thing like"
382,this. This is superb. 
383,"ELDRED: Yes, magnificent. It was to have been the vehicle to take man"
384,beyond the moon. T-Mat put an end to all that. 
385,DOCTOR: You mean this model's been abandoned? But it's speed and
386,"stability concept alone, it's a tremendous advance in rocket design. "
387,"ELDRED: Exactly! Exactly! Here, let me show it to you. Let me show it"
388,to you. 
389,(Eldred puts down his gun and helps the Doctor with the ion jet rocket
390,model.) 
391,"DOCTOR: I'll give you an hand, here we are. Oh yes, this is superb. My"
392,word. 
393,"ELDRED: And the secret, the real breakthrough, was a compact generator"
394,of enormous power. 
395,DOCTOR: I see. And these must be the secondary electrode accelerators. 
396,ELDRED: Yes. You see it beat the problem of the neutral caesium ions.
397,"And incidentally, it magnified the g-thrust to fantastic"
398,proportions! 
399,DOCTOR: That was awkward. What did you do about that? 
400,"ELDRED: Well, I'll show you. Come with me, I'll show you. Look. "
401,(Eldred and the Doctor go to the back of the room.) 
402,"DOCTOR: What have we go here? Ah, blueprints! "
403,"JAMIE: Look at them, like a couple of kids. "
404,ZOE: Yes. You can tell he's almost in love with that rocket. 
405,JAMIE: Shush! 
406,ELDRED: That's not surprising. I designed it. I've been in rocketry all
407,"my life. My father engineered the first lunar passenger module, and I"
408,travelled on the last trip back to Earth. Before it all finished. 
409,ZOE: Before all what finished? 
410,ELDRED: Space travel. 
411,"ZOE: But if the rocket was so good, why did you stop at the moon? "
412,"JAMIE: Aye, why end there? "
413,"ELDRED: Because of T-Mat. T-Mat, the ultimate in travel. With about as"
414,much sense of adventure as a synthetic carbohydrates factory. 
415,DOCTOR: But surely rockets would still be useful as an auxiliary means
416,"of transport, wouldn't they? Besides, how would man get beyond the"
417,moon? 
418,"ELDRED: Nobody cares any more about exploring space. Life made. Well,"
419,it was made too easy by T-Mat. 
420,DOCTOR: I see. So you lost government backing? 
421,"ELDRED: The project was abandoned, except by me."
422,
423, [T Mat Moonbase Control]
424,
425, FEWSHAM: You've got to help me. If we don't repair
426,"it, we'll all be killed. "
427,LOCKE: Maybe we could repair it and T-Mat back to London. 
428,FEWSHAM: With that thing guarding the door? I'm going to keep on
429,trying. 
430,LOCKE: Maybe there is something we can do. 
431,PHIPPS: What? 
432,FEWSHAM: I knew you'd see reason. 
433,(Locke goes to the panel Osgood sabotaged.) 
434,FEWSHAM: What are you doing? 
435,"LOCKE: The video link with Earth. Yes, it's not so badly damaged as the"
436,T-Mat. 
437,"FEWSHAM: We were told to repair the T-Mat link, not the video. "
438,"PHIPPS: Let's have a look. If we can't escape ourselves, maybe we can"
439,get a message through by video. 
440,"FEWSHAM: Look, the guard will see what we're doing. He'll kill us! "
441,"LOCKE: You play your game, we'll play ours."
442,
443, [Space museum]
444,
445," ELDRED: No more money, no more facilities. A"
446,life's work abandoned just like that. All because of T-Mat. 
447,"DOCTOR: Well, I can understand your bitterness. Very short-sighted of"
448,the government to put all their eggs in one basket. 
449,ELDRED: You still haven't told me who you are and what you're doing
450,here. 
451,(Beep!) 
452,DOCTOR: Well. 
453,ELDRED: That's the main-door alarm! What's going on? 
454,(Radnor and Kelly enter.) 
455,"RADNOR: Professor Daniel Eldred. Well, well, well. "
456,ELDRED: Radnor. Come to see how your spies are getting on?

460,ZOE: Hello. 
461,JAMIE: Hello. 
462,"ELDRED: Oh, Radnor, don't pretend that you don't know them. "
463,RADNOR: I can assure you I've never met them before in my life. 
464,"ELDRED: I see. I find three strangers prowling around my museum, and by"
465,the merest co-incidence you turn up on their very heels. 
466,RADNOR: I can assure you I merely wanted a chat with a very old friend.
467,
468,ELDRED: Why? You've done without a chat for a good many years. 
469,RADNOR: Old times. Friendships don't die. 
470,ELDRED: Our friendship ended the day that you walked out of my
471,laboratory and joined the government administration on T-Mat! 
472,"RADNOR: Different men, different careers, Daniel. "
473,"ELDRED: Yes, but you happened to know which career was going to be"
474,financed by government funds. 
475,RADNOR: But you could have come over with me. We asked you to join us. 
476,"ELDRED: Yes, and worked as Miss Kelly's assistant perhaps? "
477,"KELLY: You know I respect your work, Professor Eldred. We would have"
478,welcomed you on T-Mat. 
479,"ELDRED: I prefer rockets, obsolete as they are. "
480,"RADNOR: Not so obsolete as all that, Daniel, eh? "
481,ELDRED: What? 
482,"RADNOR: We don't miss very much, you know. "
483,ELDRED: So you've been spying on me. 
484,"RADNOR: Oh, no, no, no, no. We stopped that a long time ago. "
485,ELDRED: I should think so. What's wrong with running a private museum? 
486,"RADNOR: Nothing, but you're doing rather more than that, aren't you,"
487,Daniel. 
488,"ELDRED: All right, what if I am? It's a free country, isn't it? What's"
489,wrong with having a hobby? 
490,"RADNOR: Rather more than a hobby, preparing an ion rocket for an"
491,unauthorised journey into space. 
492,"ELDRED: All right, so you know. What do you intend to do? "
493,"RADNOR: My dear fellow, help you, of course. "
494,ELDRED: What? 
495,"RADNOR: You can make your trip with full government backing, as long as"
496,it's to the moon. 
497,ELDRED: Why the moon? 
498,KELLY: There's a minor fault developed at T-Mat control at Moonbase. 
499,"RADNOR: And we have to put it right, quickly. "
500,ELDRED: I thought T-Mat was infallible. 
501,"KELLY: It will be, eventually, however we have no way of reaching the"
502,moon. 
503,"ELDRED: Except by out of date rocket. Oh, that's perfect! So you need"
504,me after all. 
505,"RADNOR: I thought you'd be taken with the idea, Daniel. And a large sum"
506,"of government funds wouldn't come amiss, would they? Now, how soon can"
507,"you be ready to (pause) blast off. Well, come on, it's urgent! Can you"
508,give me an approximate ETD? 
509,ELDRED: I could. 
510,RADNOR: Good! 
511,ELDRED: But I won't! 
512,RADNOR: Why? There are no strings.

514,refuse.

574,ELDRED: I'm listening. 
575,DOCTOR: In a way this is a triumph for your rocket. 
576,ELDRED: Is it? 
577,RADNOR: Of course it is. The government recognises the fact. 
578,ELDRED: Then the government is going to be disappointed.

580,"ELDRED: Oh, I'd better be frank with you. "
581,"RADNOR: Yes, I think you'd better. "
582,ELDRED: I must admit I played with the idea of making a space flight. I
583,even prepared a rocket.

586,KELLY: You mean there's nothing?

588,RADNOR: Good! 
589,ELDRED: As for an actual lift off 
590,"RADNOR: We can do it, Daniel. I know we can. "
591,ELDRED: It takes more than enthusiasm to get a rocket off the ground. 
592,"RADNOR: You've only to ask for what you want. Funds, men, equipment. "
593,ELDRED: It needs the one thing that you have not got. Time. 
594,KELLY: A crash programme with the best available technicians. 
595,"ELDRED: It's nowhere near ready, woman! Most of the equipment is still"
596,unchecked. 
597,RADNOR: A computer can be programmed for that. 
598,ELDRED: It would still be impossibly dangerous. 
599,"RADNOR: Daniel, it was you who created this rocket. It was your driving"
600,force and enthusiasm that got it off the drawing board. With you in
601,"control, we can't fail to succeed. "
602,ELDRED: That was a long time past. Now my heart couldn't take the
603,strain of the G-force. 
604,KELLY: That doesn't mean your experience and knowledge are useless. We
605,need your guidance. 
606,ELDRED: No. I told you it's a dream. I can never go to the moon and
607,neither can rocket ZA685. 
608,JAMIE: Could we not help them? We could use the Tardis. 
609,"ZOE: What, for a trip to the moon? "
610,JAMIE: Aye. 
611,ZOE: We'd probably overshoot by a few million years. 
612,"DOCTOR: Yes, or by a few million miles. I'm afraid the Tardis is not"
613,suited to short-range travel. 
614,"ZOE: Still, I think we should help them if we can. "
615,JAMIE: Aye.

619,have my two companions. 
620,"RADNOR: Doctor, that's splendid. Thank you. "
621,ELDRED: But the rocket is not ready! 
622,"DOCTOR: Well, perhaps you're overestimating the difficulties. How much"
623,more work is required on your rocket? 
624,"ELDRED: It needs fuelling, and a complete computerised check-up. "
625,"RADNOR: Well, I can order that. "
626,ELDRED: No! I will not allow it! The risk is too great. No! 
627,"RADNOR: If there was some other way, believe me I wouldn't even"

642,"RADNOR: Listen, if this fault lasts much longer, there's going to be"
643,"worldwide chaos, and world population is at stake. "
644,ELDRED: Infallible T-Mat putting the world in jeopardy? 
645,"RADNOR: All right, I admit it. "
646,ELDRED: And now you want this man to risk his life to get you out of
647,trouble. 
648,"RADNOR: No, not me, but thousands of people all over the world who will"
649,"die if we don't take this risk. I'm sorry, but I've got no alternative."

707,ELDRED: The fuel dump on the moon. There's a refuelling system
708,connected to the landing bay. 
709,RADNOR: But surely that equipment hasn't been used for years. 
710,"ELDRED: Neither has the radio homing beam, and if that doesn't work"
711,you'll never make a landing at all. 
712,"JAMIE: Oh, in that case we needn't worry about getting back. "

950,FEWSHAM: I thought I'd best switch off the emergency link. With the
951,trouble we've got it could easily burn itself out.

980,anyone on the Moon? 
981,"ZOE: Well, it's quite simple, Jamie. It's an automatic device. We send"
982,out code radio signals which triggers the homing beacon into action. We
983,automatically lock onto it until we reach the point in orbit where we
984,fire retro-rockets to land. 
985,"JAMIE: Oh. Ah, but if they've all been cut off, how can they activate? "
986,"DOCTOR: It works off a different power source, Jamie. Solar power. It's"

1116,PHIPPS : But you mustn't land. You must warn Earth about what's
1117,happened here.

1125,"PHIPPS : Phipps. I'm in the Solar Energy Store. Now, what do you"
1126,want me to do? 
1127,"ZOE: Doctor, if we could adapt our homing equipment to his radio"

1340,this man? 
1341,(The Warriors leave.) 
1342,FEWSHAM: He's not one of the crew. I don't know him. He must have just
1343,arrived here. 
1344,SLAAR: Impossible. We control T-Mat. How did you get here? 
1345,"DOCTOR: Our resources are not limited to T-Mat, you know. "
1346,"SLAAR: You arrived here by other means, by spacecraft? "
1347,FEWSHAM: Rockets haven't been used for years. 
1348,SLAAR: Then you are lying. You have been concealed here all the time. 
1349,"DOCTOR: But you can't be sure of that, can you? The people of the Earth"
1350,may be preparing a whole fleet of rockets to defend themselves with. 
1351,SLAAR: No. Earth relies entirely on T-Mat. There is no defence against
1352,our plans. 
1353,DOCTOR: And what are your plans? Invasion by T-Mat? There are too few
1354,of you to conquer all the peoples of the Earth.

1363,DOCTOR: Do you know what is in that container? 
1364,FEWSHAM: All I know is they want me to send something to Earth by

1595,instantly. 
1596,RADNOR: Exactly. And according to this the medical unit can't believe
1597,it either. 
1598,ELDRED: Obviously what killed him was that smoke-like substance which

1792, ZOE: Which way now? 
1793,PHIPPS: I'm not sure. 
1794,ZOE: But you must remember. You've already been this way once with
1795,Jamie. 
1796,"PHIPPS: Yes, I know, but I can't remember this time. "
1797,ZOE: But surely 
1798,"PHIPPS: Look, I can't remember! All the tunnels look the same. "
1799,ZOE: Are you all right? 
1800,"PHIPPS: Oh yes, I'm fine. I've seen most of my friends killed. I'm"
1801,being hunted by monsters. 
1802,"ZOE: If you go on shouting like that, you'll be caught by them and so"
1803,will I. 
1804,PHIPPS: I'm sorry. I don't know what's the matter with me. 
1805,ZOE: It's nervous exhaustion and a slight touch of claustrophobia. Just
1806,sit down and we'll have a rest.

1809,
1810, ELDRED: I tell you that creature came here for
1811,some purpose. It must be making for somewhere. Somewhere in this area. 
1812,COMPUTER: Urgent message. Contact made with security guard observing
1813,the alien. 
1814,RADNOR: Relay report direct. 
1815,GUARD : Report to Central control.
1816,
1817, [T Mat Earth Control grounds] 
1818, GUARD: Report to Central control. The creature is
1819,entering the east compound area. 
1820,"(The Warrior sees the guard who making the report. He starts to run,"
1821,but is too late.) 
1822,RADNOR : What's happened? Report.
1823,
1824, [T Mat Earth Control]
1825,
1826, RADNOR: What's happened? Report! 
1827,COMPUTER: Security guard's ceased transmission. 
1828,RADNOR: Tell Security I want a armed patrol sent to the east command
1829,area without fail. Immediately. And relay any findings to me here
1830,direct. Top priority. 
1831,ELDRED: You're only going to lose more security guards. 
1832,"RADNOR: Well, I can't let that creature roam loose, can I? "
1833,ELDRED: Can we stop it? Do you know how we can stop it? You know that
1834,bullets will do no good. We've seen that for ourselves. In all these
1835,"cities that. Wait a moment. Yes! Oslo, Ottawa, Berlin, Hamburg, London,"
1836,"Paris, New York! These are the places where the pods have arrived. "
1837,"RADNOR: Well, so what? "
1838,"ELDRED: Well, don't you see? They're all cold climates. All northern"
1839,"hemisphere. In all of those cities it's winter, as it is here. "
1840,RADNOR: So? 
1841,ELDRED: Why haven't the pods arrived in any warm areas? 
1842,"COMPUTER: Urgent message. Subject, continued breakdown of T-Mat and"
1843,cessation of all world transport and distribution. Total breakdown of
1844,social order predicted. Emergency measures proving inadequate. 
1845,RADNOR: Discontinue report. 
1846,COMPUTER: Incoming data will be recorded. 
1847,"ELDRED: Well, the emergency measures may still save a few people. "
1848,"RADNOR: Well, what's the good of that? With the dislocation of food"
1849,"supplies, we could lose millions. "
1850,ELDRED: We may lose most of the world's population before they've
1851,finished with us. 
1852,RADNOR: They? 
1853,ELDRED: This creature. It's only the first. We're going to be invaded!

1857, KELLY: Any sign of them? 
1858,JAMIE: No. 
1859,KELLY: They've been gone ages. They can't have reached the heating
1860,controls yet. The temperature seems the same. 
1861,"JAMIE: Look, I'm going down there. "
1862,"KELLY: No, our job is to act as a rearguard in case something goes"
1863,wrong. 
1864,"JAMIE: Look, a lot of good we are. "
1865,"KELLY: Well, we're not entirely helpless. "
1866,JAMIE: You've got that thing working again? 
1867,"KELLY: I think so, but we can hardly test it. "
1868,"JAMIE: Oh look, where are they? What's keeping them?"
1869,
1870, [Maintenance tunnel]
1871,
1872, ZOE: I think we ought to go on. 
1873,PHIPPS: All right. 
1874,"ZOE: Look, can you remember the way now? "
1875,"PHIPPS: No, it's no good. "
1876,ZOE: We could work it out. 
1877,PHIPPS: How? 
1878,"ZOE: Well, presumably these maintenance tunnels run parallel to the"
1879,corridors. 
1880,"PHIPPS: Well, yes they do, but. "
1881,"ZOE: Well, I've seen a map of the corridors. The Doctor had one in the"
1882,rocket. 
1883,PHIPPS: But you can't possibly remember 
1884,"ZOE: Yes I can, I think. Now there's a main corridor here, the two"
1885,"junctions here. We went left, right, left. It must be that one. "
1886,PHIPPS: But you and Jamie got lost on the way to the solar energy
1887,storeroom. 
1888,"ZOE: Well, only temporarily, I found the way eventually. "
1889,"PHIPPS: Well, you'd better be right this time. "
1890,ZOE: Oh come on! 
1891,"(A little later, Zoe and Phipps are looking into the Control room.) "
1892,"ZOE: Oh, how long is it going to stand there? "
1893,PHIPPS: I don't know. But I daren't move the grille until it goes.

1896,
1897," JAMIE: Look, I'd better see what's happened to"
1898,them. 
1899,"KELLY: All right, but "
1900,JAMIE: What? 
1901,"KELLY: Shush. Quick, the door! "
1902,JAMIE: Too late! 
1903,(As Warrior enters.) 
1904,JAMIE: (silent) Now! 
1905,(Kelly turns on the solar power line but nothing happens.) 
1906,JAMIE: (silent) Come on. 
1907,(The Warrior turns to leave then returns.)

1920,WARRIOR: Do not ask questions! 
1921,"FEWSHAM: I need food, rest. I haven't had any sleep for hours. "
1922,(Fewsham spots Zoe and Phipps peering out of the grille.) 
1923,WARRIOR: What are you doing? 
1924,FEWSHAM: I must fix the cubicle. 
1925,WARRIOR: But you said T-Mat was functioning properly. 
1926,"FEWSHAM: I know, but there's something I've forgotten. "
1927,"(The Warrior follows Fewsham, with its back to the grille.)"
1928,

1936," (Zoe sneaks around the wall, in front of a"
1937,"brightly lit screen, to the heating wheel. But it is stiff, she can't"
1938,move it at first. Finally she moves it 180 degrees right and starts to
1939,creep back as the temperature climbs rapidly. The Warrior spots her.) 
1940,"PHIPPS: Look out, Zoe! "
1941,(The Warrior kills Phipps. Zoe stands in front of the bright panel.) 
1942,"ZOE: Well, help me, can't you? Help me! "
1943,(The Warrior walks towards Zoe.)

1947,
1948," (Fewsham finally acts, and tries to deflect the"
1949,Warrior's aim away from Zoe. It knocks him away as Zoe stands frozen in
1950,"fear. The temperature is climbing up to forty degrees C, and the"
1951,Warrior suddenly puts its claws to its head and collapses. Zoe runs
1952,over to Fewsham.) 
1953,ZOE: Are you all right? 
1954,"FEWSHAM: Yes, I am. Who are you? What are you doing here? "
1955,"ZOE: Oh, never mind that. I thought you were on their side. "
1956,FEWSHAM: Is that what they all think? 
1957,"ZOE: Well, you have been helping them, haven't you. "
1958,FEWSHAM: I had no alternative. They'd have killed me. 
1959,"ZOE: Well look, where are the other Ice Warriors? "
1960,"FEWSHAM: I think they've gone to their ship, but they'll be coming"
1961,back. We must get out of here. 
1962,ZOE: Oh but how? 
1963,"FEWSHAM: Look, I can get you back to Earth. T-Mat is working again. "
1964,"ZOE: Oh! Well, I'll get back to the others and tell them the good news."

1967, (The Warrior is about to leave when the Doctor
1968,starts groaning.) 
1969,"DOCTOR: Oh, Victoria, Jamie. "
1970,(The Warrior walks past Jamie's hiding place and he smashes down on its
1971,weapon with a metal bar. It throws him across the room so Kelly has a
1972,go too. She is easily thrown off and it grabs Jamie's wrists.) 
1973,JAMIE: No! 
1974,(The thermometer passes fifty degrees C and the Warrior collapses.) 
1975,"DOCTOR: Oh, well done, Jamie. "
1976,KELLY: Are you all right? 
1977,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. Oh, I'm a bit dizzy. It's so hot in here. "
1978,"JAMIE: Aye, lucky for us. Zoe and Phipps turned the heating up just in"
1979,time. 
1980,"DOCTOR: What? Well, where are they now? "
1981,KELLY: They went though the maintenance tunnel to the main control
1982,room. 
1983,(Zoe enters through the hatch.) 
1984,"DOCTOR: Ah, Zoe! "
1985,"ZOE: Oh Doctor! (they hug) Oh, are you all right? "
1986,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. "
1987,ZOE: Good. 
1988,JAMIE: Where's Phipps? 
1989,ZOE: He's dead. An Ice Warrior killed him. 
1990,KELLY: How did you manage to escape? 
1991,ZOE: That other man helped me. 
1992,KELLY: Fewsham? 
1993,ZOE: Yes. 
1994,KELLY: Well I thought that he was working for them. 
1995,ZOE: He saved my life. 
1996,KELLY: Doesn't sound much like Fewsham. 
1997,ZOE: He attacked a Warrior. He's also got T-Mat working again. 
1998,"DOCTOR: Well, do I gather we can get back to Earth then? "
1999,"ZOE: Yes, I think so. "
2000,"KELLY: Well, let's not waste any more time. "

2008,"ELDRED: Gregson, eh? "
2009,RADNOR: Sir James Gregson. 
2010,ELDRED: United Nations Plenipotentiary. 
2011,RADNOR: Minister with special responsibility for T-Mat. 
2012,"ELDRED: And your boss, in other words! "
2013,"RADNOR: Oh, don't. "
2014,(An older man enters and hands his briefcase to Radnor.) 
2015,"GREGSON: Radnor, I've read your report. I can't make head nor tail of"
2016,it. Who's this? 
2017,"RADNOR: Professor Eldred, sir. "
2018,ELDRED: How do you do. 
2019,GREGSON: Oh well. 
2020,"RADNOR: He's helping me, sir. "
2021,GREGSON: This breakdown of T-Mat. What is the position now? 
2022,"RADNOR: Still no contact yet with Moonbase, sir. "
2023,GREGSON: And what are you doing about it? 
2024,RADNOR: We've got people up there. 
2025,GREGSON: How'd you get them there without T-Mat? 
2026,"RADNOR: We sent a rocket, sir. Professor Eldred is an expert in"
2027,rocketry. 
2028,"GREGSON: Oh, I see. And what happened to the rocket? "
2029,"RADNOR: It's rather difficult to say, sir. We lost radio contact with"
2030,it soon after take-off. 
2031,GREGSON: Is that all you've done? 
2032,"RADNOR: Oh no. No, my Chief Technician, Miss Kelly, has also gone to"
2033,Moonbase. 
2034,"GREGSON: Oh, more rockets. "
2035,"RADNOR: No, sir, she went by T-Mat. "
2036,GREGSON: But T-Mat isn't working. 
2037,"RADNOR: Well, T-Mat started to function again, sir, so Miss Kelly went"
2038,to the Moonbase with a repair team. 
2039,GREGSON: So you've had a full report from her? 
2040,"RADNOR: Well, no, sir. Soon after take off T-Mat ceased to function"
2041,again. 
2042,GREGSON: But this is quite ridiculous. T-Mat out of action and then
2043,this sudden outbreak of some sort of crop blight. 
2044,"RADNOR: Ah, now, you see, sir, we think that's connected "
2045,GREGSON: As for this incredible story about a monster from outer-space 
2046,"RADNOR: Well you see, Sir James, I think I owe you an explanation. "
2047,GREGSON: What happened about this creature? Have you any more news? 
2048,"ELDRED: No, it seems to have completely disappeared. It was reported"
2049,"here, then it was seen by some workmen in a building here, and the last"
2050,sighting was by the Weather Control Bureau there. 
2051,(The Warrior walks through the foam to the Weather Control building and
2052,forces its way inside. The duty weatherman tries to run but is killed.
2053,It then goes to a convenient Weather Control Unit and moves all the
2054,"levers to 'Dry', then uses its weapon on it, fusing the controls in"
2055,place.)
2056,
2057, [T Mat Moonbase Control]
2058,
2059, FEWSHAM: But I had to help them or they would have
2060,killed me! 
2061,"KELLY: All right, Fewsham. There'll be a full inquiry when we get back"
2062,to Earth. Tell them. We've no more time to waste here. We must T-Mat
2063,back to Earth immediately. 
2064,"DOCTOR: But if we're all going, who is going to dispatch us? "
2065,"FEWSHAM: Look, there's a way of doing that. Here. This is a time"
2066,switch. It delays transportation by ten seconds. 
2067,"DOCTOR: Oh, I see. How ingenious. "
2068,"FEWSHAM: Now I'll dispatch you, and follow using the time switch. "
2069,"DOCTOR: Righto. Jamie, Zoe, come along. I think this could be quite"
2070,"fun, you know. "
2071,JAMIE: Oh. 
2072,"(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe get into a cubicle.) "
2073,"KELLY: Fewsham, that time switch was down on the maintenance report as"
2074,being inoperable. 
2075,FEWSHAM: We repaired it. 
2076,"(The Doctor, Zoe and Jamie vanish.) "
2077,"FEWSHAM: In you get, Miss Kelly. Look, I'll use the time switch. You'd"
2078,better hurry or those Ice Warriors could be back any minute.
2079,
2080, [T Mat Earth Control]
2081,
2082," DOCTOR: You know, I find T-Mat travel rather"
2083,disappointing. There's no sensation at all. 
2084,RADNOR: Where have you been? 
2085,DOCTOR: Ah. 
2086,RADNOR: And what have you been up to all this time? 
2087,DOCTOR: Well 
2088,RADNOR: And where's Miss Kelly. 
2089,(Kelly appears in the T-Mat cubicle.) 
2090,"RADNOR: Miss Kelly! Miss Kelly, what's happening up there? "
2091,GREGSON: Will somebody kindly tell me what's happening down here? Who
2092,are these people? Is T-Mat working again? 
2093,DOCTOR: Please! Let us answer one question at a time. 
2094,"ELDRED: Doctor, do you know there's been a alien here? "
2095,"JAMIE: An Ice Warrior, here? "
2096,"DOCTOR: Jamie, I am not surprised. They have taken over the whole of"
2097,the Moonbase. 
2098,RADNOR: What about the crew? 
2099,KELLY: All dead except Fewsham. 
2100,RADNOR: You left him there? 
2101,KELLY: Well he said he'd follow using the time switch. 
2102,DOCTOR: He should be back. 
2103,(Kelly goes to the control panel.) 
2104,RADNOR: What's happening? 
2105,KELLY: I thought so. The time switch is out of order. 
2106,DOCTOR: What? But he said he was going to repair it. 
2107,KELLY: He was lying. 
2108,RADNOR: But why? 
2109,"KELLY: Well, he's obviously working for them. "
2110,DOCTOR: Then why did he let us escape?
2111,
2112, [T Mat Moonbase Control]
2113,
2114, (Fewsham is waiting. As soon as he hears Slaar's
2115,breathing he pretends to be unconscious across the control desk. Slaar
2116,staggers in and goes over to the temperature control. Fewsham follows
2117,him. Slaar turns the temperature down to cold.) 
2118,SLAAR: What has happened here? 
2119,"FEWSHAM: The others, they got in through the grille and turned up the"
2120,heating. 
2121,SLAAR: Where are they now? 
2122,FEWSHAM: They went back to Earth by T-Mat. 
2123,SLAAR: Why did you not go with them? 
2124,FEWSHAM: I refused. That's why they attacked me. 
2125,SLAAR: Refused? Why? 
2126,FEWSHAM: What do you think would have happened to me back on Earth? I'd
2127,have been executed as a traitor. 
2128,SLAAR: So you hope to live longer by staying here. You value your life.
2129,That is good. You will live if you help us when the invasion fleet
2130,arrives. 
2131,FEWSHAM: You're going to land on Earth? 
2132,"SLAAR: No, our warriors will land here, on the moon. When the seed pods"
2133,have done their work on Earth it will be time to commence the second
2134,stage of our plan.
2135,
2136, [T Mat Earth Control]
2137,
2138, DOCTOR: But don't you see gentlemen? The invasion
2139,"of Moonbase, the taking over of T-Mat, the seed pods, the arrival of"
2140,the Ice Warrior. They're all part of the same plan. 
2141,RADNOR: Plan? What plan? 
2142,"GREGSON: These incidents are so unrelated. This fungus everywhere,"
2143,what's that got to do with it? 
2144,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm not sure yet. Have your people been able to make"
2145,anything of it? 
2146,RADNOR: Well it's indestructible. We've attacked it in every possible
2147,"way, but without success. "
2148,"DOCTOR: Yes, but have you tried to understand it? "
2149,"GREGSON: Are you suggesting we should psychoanalyse it, Doctor? "
2150,"DOCTOR: I'm only suggesting that instead of trying to destroy it, you"
2151,find out it's composition and purpose.
2152,"ELDRED: Well, there's laboratory equipment in my workshop. You could"
2153,use that. 
2154,DOCTOR: Good. Then we must find a sample. 
2155,"RADNOR: Well, no problem about that. The gardens are full of the stuff."
2156,
2157,DOCTOR: Fine. Then there's no time to be lost. 
2158,ELDRED: I'll get some equipment for you. 
2159,"RADNOR: Er, Doctor, do be careful. Those pod things are deadly. "
2160,DOCTOR: Don't worry. I've already had experience. I'll be careful.
2161,
2162, [T Mat Earth Rest area]
2163,
2164,(Zoe and Jamie are sipping drinks while Kelly
2165,writes on a clip board.) 
2166,ZOE: But why did Fewsham stay on the moon? 
2167,KELLY: Pretty obvious. He was too afraid to come back here and face an
2168,inquiry. 
2169,"ZOE: But he wasn't afraid to stay up there with the Ice Warriors. Well,"
2170,given the choice I know which I'd rather face. 
2171,JAMIE: Aye. 
2172,KELLY: There's no time to worry about Fewsham. We must find a way of
2173,getting T-Mat working. 
2174,ZOE: But I thought it was working again now. 
2175,KELLY: It is working. It's still controlled from the moon. We must find
2176,a way of controlling it from the Earth. 
2177,ZOE: But is that possible? Don't you need the moon as a relay? 
2178,KELLY: There might be a way. I must talk to Commander Radnor about it. 
2179,(Kelly leaves.) 
2180,"JAMIE: Zoe, look, do you think the Doctor knows what he's doing messing"
2181,about with that foam stuff? 
2182,"ZOE: Oh, don't worry, Jamie. He'll be all right. "
2183,"JAMIE: Oh, yes. "
2184,"(Outside, the Doctor gets a sample of fungus on a spatula and puts it"
2185,"in a large glass container, oblivious to the bubble growing nearby. It"
2186,"bursts, and he leaps up in alarm. Covering his mouth with a large"
2187,"kerchief, he quickly scoops up foam with the container and runs.)"
2188,
2189, [T Mat Earth Control]
2190,
2191, RADNOR: You really think it would work? 
2192,"KELLY: Well, it couldn't be as effective as the Moonbase, of course,"
2193,which handles up to two million microwave channels simultaneously. The
2194,satellite would take just a few thousand. 
2195,GREGSON: But that'd be enough for vital food supplies. 
2196,RADNOR: But surely we can't use the normal communications satellites.
2197,They're not programmed for T-Mat. 
2198,"KELLY: No, we'd have to send up a specially programmed one. "
2199,"ZOE: But that would mean using a rocket, wouldn't it? I thought no one"
2200,used them nowadays. 
2201,"KELLY: Not manned rockets, but we do send up satellites for"
2202,communications. 
2203,RADNOR: How soon can you get one up? 
2204,KELLY: Well I don't know. If it were given top priority.
2205,
2206, [Eldred's laboratory]
2207,
2208, (Under a microscope cells divide rapidly.) 
2209,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's organic. It's alive. Definitely a fungus composition."
2210,
2211,(The Doctor picks up a molecular model.) 
2212,DOCTOR: You're sure that this is correct? 
2213,"ELDRED: As far as I can make out, it is. "
2214,"DOCTOR: A molecule of five atoms absorbs oxygen. You know, a complete"
2215,blanket of this would reduce the oxygen content of the Earth's

2244,"DOCTOR : Is Commander Radnor there, please? Ah, Zoe! Is"
2245,Radnor there? 
2246,"ZOE: No, he's in conference with Miss Kelly and Sir James Gregson. "

2663,"MARSHALL : You must use that time to obtain another human,"
2664,and do not kill him. 
2665,"SLAAR: No, Grand Marshall. "
2666,MARSHALL : You will be prepared to activate the homing beam
2667,on our signal? 
2668,"SLAAR: All is prepared, Grand Marshall. "
2669,(Transmission ends.) 
2670,SLAAR: I shall return to our ship to finalise invasion plans.
2671,
2672, [Weather Control Room]
2673,
2674," DOCTOR: Right, now then, Zoe, let's see what"
2675,"happens when we try to connect these two together. (they spark.) No, I"
2676,"don't think so, somehow. What about these two? (no sparks so he twists"
2677,"the ends together) Ah, that's better. I think I've succeeded in"
2678,"re-establishing one of these rain circuits, Jamie. "
2679,(Jamie is up on a cat walk looking out of the window.) 
2680,JAMIE: It's not raining yet. 
2681,"DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie. Weather control is a very difficult technology. You"
2682,can't expect immediate results. 
2683,"ZOE: Are you sure you're getting it right, Doctor? "
2684,"DOCTOR: Well, I hope so, Zoe. Just have to hope for the best, that's"
2685,all. I must get on because there's another little job that I want to
2686,do. 
2687,JAMIE: Have you not got enough to do already? 
2688,ZOE: What else is there? 
2689,"DOCTOR: Well, I want to make some alterations to my solar energy"
2690,device.
2691,
2692, [T-Mat Earth Control]
2693,
2694, MAN : Lift off in five seconds from now. Five.
2695,Four. Three. Two. One. Zero. 
2696,"(The rocket lifts off. The Doctor with his infra-red lamps, Zoe and"
2697,Jamie enter.) 
2698,"DOCTOR: With any luck, we should have some nice heavy rain before long."
2699,"Ah, there we are. "
2700,"KELLY: Yes, the satellite. "
2701,ELDRED: Isn't that a beautiful sight? 
2702,KELLY: We finished and installed the homing device. It's working
2703,perfectly. 
2704,DOCTOR: Well done. 
2705,"KELLY: Doctor? DOCTOR: Yes, Miss Kelly? "
2706,"KELLY: I know we're sending up a false signal, but aren't some of the"
2707,Martian ships bound to follow the right one? 
2708,DOCTOR: There isn't going to be a right one. There's only going to be
2709,"ours, the wrong one, and that's going to lead the entire Martian fleet"
2710,into an orbit around the sun. 
2711,ZOE: What about Slaar's signal? 
2712,"DOCTOR: Oh, obviously that has to be stopped. "
2713,ELDRED: But how? 
2714,"DOCTOR: Well, as soon as the satellite is up, I shall T-Mat myself to"
2715,the moon and destroy their homing device. 
2716,KELLY: They'll kill you on sight. 
2717,"DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think so. I've rigged up a rather interesting"
2718,little device here. 
2719,KELLY: What's it for? 
2720,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a development of the solar energy device that you so"
2721,"successfully used on the moon, only I've succeeded in rendering it"
2722,portable. I've got a solar battery. 
2723,(The satellite has been deployed and is transmitting.) 
2724,"KELLY: Well, there it is. It's in orbit. We're now picking up the"
2725,"alien's homing signal from the moon. DOCTOR: Well, that means that"
2726,their invasion fleet is getting closer. There's not time to be lost.
2727,"Now, are you quite clear? As soon as I have succeeded in destroying"
2728,their signal you must activate our signal in the satellite. 
2729,"RADNOR: Oh, we'll be ready. "
2730,"DOCTOR: Right, then I'll be off. "
2731,ZOE: Oh Doctor? 
2732,"DOCTOR: Yes? What is it, Zoe? "
2733,"ZOE: You will be careful, won't you? "
2734,"DOCTOR: Don't worry, Zoe, I will. Are you ready, Miss Kelly? "
2735,"KELLY: But Doctor, our control of T-Mat hasn't been tested. "
2736,DOCTOR: Then now's the time to test it.
2737,
2738, [T Mat Moonbase Control]
2739,
2740, (It works. The only Warrior there has its back to
2741,"the T-Mat cubicle. The Doctor sneaks out of the cubicle, the Warrior"
2742,turns and the Doctor uses the solar projectors on it. The Doctor puts
2743,down his device and starts fiddling with the Slaar's communication
2744,device. Another Warrior enters with Slaar. The Doctor surrenders.) 
2745,SLAAR: No. 
2746,(The Warrior lowers its weapon.) 
2747,"SLAAR: You, over there. I ordered you to be destroyed! "
2748,"DOCTOR: Well, you weren't very successful, were you. "
2749,SLAAR: Destroy that weapon. 
2750,(The warrior fires.) 
2751,SLAAR: What is your purpose in coming here? 
2752,"DOCTOR: Well, you don't expect me to tell you that, do you? "
2753,SLAAR: The directional beam is still operative. 
2754,DOCTOR: Yes. I'm afraid you were a little too quick for me. 
2755,SLAAR: Are you capable of operating the T-Mat mechanism? 
2756,"DOCTOR: Oh no, I don't think I could "
2757,(Slaar gestures the Warrior to shoot the Doctor.) 
2758,"DOCTOR: Well, well yes, perhaps I could get the hang of it. "
2759,"SLAAR: As long as you can be useful to us, you can live. But this time"
2760,there will be no escape. You will familiarise yourself with the T-Mat
2761,controls. 
2762,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you very much. "
2763,SLAAR: You will not touch the controls until I give the order.
2764,
2765, [T-Mat Earth Control]
2766,
2767, KELLY: It's operating perfectly. 
2768,RADNOR: Good! 
2769,ELDRED: Shouldn't we have waited until the Doctor got back? 
2770,"RADNOR: The moon signal has disappeared, hasn't it? "
2771,ELDRED: It may be purely atmospheric. For all we know they're still
2772,transmitting as strong as ever. 
2773,ZOE: The moon signal was strong enough before the Doctor left. He must
2774,have succeeded. 
2775,JAMIE: Then why hasn't he come back?
2776,
2777, [T Mat Moonbase Control]
2778,
2779, MARSHALL : We are receiving your
2780,homing signal clearly. Soon we shall enter the gravitational field of
2781,the moon. 
2782,"SLAAR: All is prepared, Grand Marshall. I have obtained the services of"
2783,another human. He will T-Mat our warriors to Earth. 
2784,MARSHALL : Good. I shall resume transmission when landing
2785,is imminent. 
2786,(Transmission ends.) 
2787,"SLAAR: When our warriors arrive, you will transmit them to Earth under"
2788,my direction. 
2789,"DOCTOR: Yes, but they haven't arrived yet, have they. Something still"
2790,"might go wrong, you know. "
2791,SLAAR: Nothing can go wrong now. 
2792,DOCTOR: There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip. 
2793,"SLAAR: If anything does go wrong, you will be the first to die."
2794,
2795, [T-Mat Earth Control]
2796,
2797, (The invasion fleet is on radar.) 
2798,RADNOR: Scan closer! 
2799,"KELLY: If they are going to divert, if should happen any moment now. "
2800,"ZOE: Look, they're changing course. "
2801,RADNOR: I think you're right. 
2802,"ELDRED: Yes, they're all following the satellite signal. "
2803,RADNOR: Then the Doctor must have succeeded. He must have turned off
2804,the Martian signal. 
2805,"JAMIE: Well, what's happening up there, then? Why hasn't he come back? "
2806,"RADNOR: Don't worry, Jamie. A squad of security guards armed with"
2807,"flamethrowers are on their way here now, and as soon as they get here"
2808,we'll T-Mat them to the moon. 
2809,"JAMIE: Oh, they'll be too late. "
2810,RADNOR: You'll just have to be patient! 
2811,"JAMIE: Och, I'm sick of being patient! "
2812,(Jamie takes Zoe aside and whispers.) 
2813,JAMIE: Zoe. That T-Mat thing. Do you know how it works? 
2814,ZOE: I think so. Why? 
2815,JAMIE: Could you T-Mat me back to the moon? 
2816,"ZOE: Oh, now Jamie, surely "
2817,"JAMIE: Look, either the Doctor's all right, in which case we've no need"
2818,"to worry, or he's in danger and he needs my help."
2819,
2820, [T Mat Moonbase Control]
2821, 
2822,
2823, MARSHALL : Slaar! We are passing
2824,between Earth and moon! The signal has not led us into the moon's
2825,gravitational field! 
2826,SLAAR: Have you lost my signal? 
2827,"MARSHALL : Your signal is being received clearly, but we"
2828,are off course. 
2829,SLAAR: Are you sure your calculations are correct? 
2830,MARSHALL : Our calculations have been checked. You have
2831,sent us into an orbit close to the sun! 
2832,SLAAR: Use your retro-active rockets to change course! 
2833,MARSHALL : It is too late. We have insufficient fuel for
2834,"manoeuvre. You have failed us, Slaar! We shall all die! We are being"
2835,drawn into the orbit of the sun! 
2836,(Transmission ends.) 
2837,SLAAR: This is impossible! 
2838,(Slaar checks the communications device.) 
2839,SLAAR: The signal. There is no power. You did this. 
2840,DOCTOR: Yes. That signal has been going no further than this control
2841,room. 
2842,SLAAR: But they were receiving my signal. 
2843,DOCTOR: Not your signal. Ours. 
2844,SLAAR: You sent a signal from Earth? 
2845,DOCTOR: We sent up a satellite. That signal has sent your fleet into a
2846,false orbit. 
2847,SLAAR: The heat of the sun will kill them! You have destroyed our
2848,entire fleet! 
2849,DOCTOR: You tried to destroy an entire world. 
2850,SLAAR: Earth will still die. The fungus will take the oxygen from your
2851,atmosphere. 
2852,"DOCTOR: No, I'm afraid that you've failed there too. We can destroy the"
2853,fungus. 
2854,SLAAR: Kill him! 
2855,(A voice calls out from the T-Mat cubicle.) 
2856,JAMIE: Doctor! 
2857,"DOCTOR: Jamie, look out! "
2858,(The Doctor leaps over the T-Mat control desk and tackles the Warrior.
2859,He diverts its aim so that Slaar dies instead of Jamie. Jamie runs
2860,across the room and leaps on the Warrior.) 
2861,JAMIE: Creag an tuire! 
2862,(The Doctor holds up his solar energy power leads.) 
2863,"DOCTOR: Jamie, a live terminal! "
2864,(Jamie and the Doctor each press the leads into the Warrior's body.
2865,There is a bright flash and the Warrior collapses.) 
2866,"DOCTOR: Oh, well done, Jamie! Oh, goodness me! Jamie, thank you very"
2867,"much. Now then, we must T-Mat ourselves back to Earth."
2868,
2869, [T-Mat Earth Control] 
2870,(Where a heavy thunderstorm is washing away the
2871,foam.) 
2872,COMPUTER: Wide spread rainfall throughout the country. Some flooding
2873,but none serious. Fungus rapidly disappearing. Weather Control Bureau
2874,coming back into operation. World food shortages partially relieved now
2875,T-Mat becoming operational again. Message to Commander Radnor from the
2876,Security Council of the United Nations. Congratulations. 
2877,"RADNOR: All right, discontinue report. "
2878,ZOE: So you really did know what you were doing at the Weather Control
2879,Bureau. 
2880,"DOCTOR: But, Zoe, of course I did! "
2881,"JAMIE: Aye, well, it took long enough to work, eh? "
2882,"RADNOR: Well, the rain seems to have disposed of the fungus well"
2883,enough. Now the next thing to do is to get T-Mat fully operational
2884,again. 
2885,"KELLY: Yes, when moon relay's repaired we must check over the equipment"
2886,and build in safeguards. From now on T-Mat must be entirely controlled
2887,from Earth. 
2888,"ELDRED: Oh, surely you've learned not to put all of your eggs in one"
2889,basket in future? 
2890,KELLY: T-Mat in itself is perfectly effective. 
2891,ELDRED: You need a secondary transportation system. A fleet of rockets
2892,on permanent standby. 
2893,"RADNOR: Yes, but Professor Eldred, we "
2894,KELLY: There's no need to go to those lengths. 
2895,ELDRED: It's a question of common sense. I'm sure the Doctor will agree
2896,with me. Doctor. 
2897,"(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe are not there.)"
2898,
2899, [Space museum]
2900,
2901, JAMIE: Did you have to make it rain as hard as all
2902,that? 
2903,"DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie, sometimes I think you're never satisfied. "
2904,ZOE: What did you rush us back here for? 
2905,"DOCTOR: Well, you know, questions, explanations. It's very difficult."
2906,Come on. 
2907,(The Doctor enters the Tardis.) 
2908,"ZOE: Oh, where are going now? "
2909,"JAMIE: Oh, it's no good asking him. He's no more idea than the man in"
2910,the moon. 
2911,"DOCTOR: I heard that, Jamie. Come on. "
2912,"(They all get into the Tardis, and it dematerialises.)  "
