18," DOCTOR: I wouldn't had thought it possible, but"
19,"somehow we've materialised, for a split second of time, and been"
20,imprisoned in some kind of force. I simply can't break its hold.
21,"Somewhere, somehow, we're being slowly dragged down. "
22,IAN: Dragged down? To what?

31,
32,(Everyone is out of Roman garb and back to normal.
33,The scanner is displaying the area outside.) 
34,DOCTOR: All responses negative. Air thin and static. Hmm! 
35,"BARBARA: Crags and pools. Oh, it's like a cemetery, it's so quiet. "
36,"IAN: Yeah, no vegetation, and I haven't seen anything move yet. We're"
37,on the moon. 
38,"DOCTOR: Oh, what is holding us here? What force, hmm? "
39,VICKI: That looks a bit grim. Where are we? 
40,DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh. 
41,"IAN: Doctor, can't there just be something wrong with the Tardis? "
42,"DOCTOR: Wrong? My boy, we've been dragged off our course. The question"
43,"is, is it some natural phenomena or is it intelligent, deliberate, or"
44,"for a purpose, hmm? "
45,"BARBARA: Oh, you'll find the answer, Doctor. You always do. "
46,DOCTOR: What 
47,BARBARA: You'll find the answer. 
48,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, my dear, yes, I'm confident that I can counteract it"
49,with more power. Yes. Nowm let me see. 
50,(Vicki winces)

55,high-piched beeps to each other)

58,
59," DOCTOR: Good. Good, The power response is"
60,satisfactory. 
61,VICKI: Can you hear it? Listen. 
62,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
63,VICKI: What is it? 
64,DOCTOR: Oh. 
65,"VICKI: Ian, Barbara, what is it? "
66,"IAN: What can you hear, Vicki? "
67,"VICKI: A sort of humming. Ooo, can't you hear it? "
68,"IAN: Do you hear anything, Doctor? "
69,"DOCTOR: Oh, she's probably heard an extra-sonic sound. You know, the"
70,"thing that young people and young animals hear. Excuse me, you're in"
71,the way. 
72,"VICKI: Oh, it's stopped. Barbara, it's stopped. "
73,BARBARA: Are you all right now? 
74,"VICKI: Yes. Yes, thanks. "
75,"BARBARA: Doctor? Doctor, we must get out of here. "
76,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, I quite agree. I quite agree. The power build up is"
77,"strong enough. Yes, quite satisfactory. Well now the motors. Wait a"
78,minute. Yes.

81,
82, (A massive woodlouse thing joins the mega-ants.
83,"The Tardis tries to dematerialise, but fails)"
84,
85,[Tardis]
86,
87," (The mega-ant noise can be clearly heard, and the"
88,Tardis wobbles. Everyone is thrown about and the scanner goes wild)
89,"IAN: What's happening, Doctor, what's happening? "
90,DOCTOR: We seem to be caught! Trapped somehow. Is it some strange
91,phenomena? There's no power in the ship. It's useless. 
92,"BARBARA: Ian, Doctor, look. I saw a flash behind one of those crags. "
93,IAN: Where? 
94,BARBARA: Out there. I saw it. I saw it. 
95,"IAN: Well, it's not there now. "
96,BARBARA: Well I can see it's not there. 
97,"DOCTOR: All right, all right, don't snap at each other, my dear. "
98,BARBARA: I'm sorry. 
99,DOCTOR: You probably saw some cosmic ray which is causing the
100,interference. 
101,"BARBARA: Well, I was almost. Vicki? "
102,(Vicki is still on the floor) 
103,"VICKI: The noise, did it stop? "
104,"BARBARA: Yes. It's all gone now. Come on, I think you'd better lie down"
105,for a while. 
106,"DOCTOR: So disturbing, all this interference. "
107,"IAN: Well, Doctor? "
108,"DOCTOR: I can't understand it. Well, there's nothing for it, my boy,"
109,"but we shall, er, it's a matter of exploration. We shall have to go and"
110,find the trouble of this interference and then learn how to counteract
111,it. 
112,IAN: Oh No need for the other two to come. I'll go and tell them. 
113,DOCTOR: Quite so. 
114,"IAN: Oh, how is she? "
115,"BARBARA: Oh, she's better. Oh, Doctor? Do you have such a thing as a"
116,sedative? 
117,"DOCTOR: Of course, my dear. It's in the first aid box. You know where"
118,"it is. There, it's facing you. "
119,(The DOCTOR points to a box which is among many pieces on a table in
120,the alcove.) 
121,"BARBARA: Oh, yes. "
122,(She goes to an alcove) 
123,"BARBARA: Oh, Doctor, what a mess. Honestly, one of these days I'm going"
124,to have a jolly good spring clean around here. 
125,"IAN: She's asleep already. Oh, er, Barbara, the Doctor and I are going"
126,outside to have a look around. Now don't worry. I won't let him out of
127,my sight. 
128,"DOCTOR: Nearly done, my boy, hmm? "
129,"IAN: Yes, we're ready. "
130,"BARBARA: You will be careful, both of you. "
131,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, of course, of course. Now then, I want you to"
132,wear this ADJ. 
133,IAN: This what? 
134,"DOCTOR: It's an Atmospheric Density Jacket, to be precise. Oh, I see."
135,Is the atmosphere a bit thin? 
136,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid it's rather sub-normal. "
137,"IAN: Hello, what's this extraordinary thing? "
138,"DOCTOR: Oh, these are what they technically call a respiratory"
139,compensator. 
140,"IAN: Oh, I see. A sort of advanced oxygen mask, eh? "
141,"DOCTOR: Exactly, exactly. "
142,"IAN: Well, come on then, Doctor. Ah. How do we open the doors? We have"
143,no power. 
144,"DOCTOR: Ah, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear. Hmm. It's one thing after"
145,another. 
146,IAN: (Smiling.) Hmm? 
147,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I, er, I, er. I didn't want to, er. "
148,IAN: Hey? 
149,(The Doctor takes his signet ring off.) 
150,"DOCTOR: This is not merely a decorative object. Come along, come along."
151,
152,(The Doctor flicks some switches and waves the ring in front of an
153,"electric eye. The main doors open and he scuttles out, chuckling. Ian"
154,follows and the doors close again) 
155,[Women's bedroom]
156,
157, (Vicki is on one of the S-shaped beds) 
158,"BARBARA: Vicki? Here, take these. You'll feel much better. "
159,VICKI: What is it? 
160,"BARBARA: Oh, it's just something to make you sleep. "
161,VICKI: May I see the container. 
162,BARBARA: Any aches or pains. 
163,"VICKI: No, I didn't hurt myself. My ears still sting a bit, but that's"
164,all. 
165,"BARBARA: Well, have you decided yet whether to take the prescribed"
166,dose? 
167,VICKI: It looks a bit medieval. 
168,BARBARA: What do you mean? 
169,"VICKI: Well, you wouldn't like it if I wanted to stick leaches all over"
170,"you, would you? And I mean, it boils down to the same thing. They might"
171,"have taken these in your time, but that doesn't mean "
172,"BARBARA: Now, wait a minute. You can't blame my generation for"
173,everything and those pills belong to the Doctor. 
174,VICKI: He must have picked them up on his travels then because I've
175,never seen Asperin before. 
176,"BARBARA: Oh, so you studied medicine at school, did you? "
177,"VICKI: Yes, of course I did. Didn't you teach it? "
178,BARBARA: No. We worked upwards from the three R's. 
179,VICKI: Hmm? 
180,"BARBARA: Reading, writing, ï¿½rithmatic. "
181,"VICKI: Oh, it was a nursery school. "
182,BARBARA: It was not. 
183,VICKI: Oh. I wish I'd gone to your school. We had to take a certificate
184,"of education in medicine, physics, chemistry. "
185,"BARBARA: Now, wait a minute, how old were you? "
186,"VICKI: Well, I was ten when I took those. "
187,"BARBARA: Ten? What did you do in your time, live in the classroom? "
188,VICKI: Live in the what? 
189,BARBARA: Classroom. Lecture hall. 
190,(blank look) 
191,BARBARA: How long did you study? 
192,"VICKI: Almost an hour a week. We had these machines, you see, and we "
193,"BARBARA: All right, Vicki. Now look, you don't there's anything wrong"
194,"with those pills, do you? "
195,VICKI: No. 
196,"BARBARA: Well, why don't you just pander to my old-fashioned medieval"
197,superstitions and take them for me? 
198,VICKI: Well. 
199,"BARBARA: After all, it would save me having to put make-up on and a"
200,mask and dance round a fire in order to get rid of the evil spirits. 
201,VICKI: All right!. 
202,BARBARA: Good. 
203,"VICKI: That's nice, Barbara. I haven't seen you wear it before. "
204,"BARBARA: The bracelet? No, I haven't had it for very long. "
205,VICKI: Was it a present? 
206,BARBARA: Mmm. 
207,VICKI: From Ian? 
208,"BARBARA: No. From Nero, as a matter of fact. "
209,"VICKI: From Nero? But it couldn't have been, we "
210,BARBARA: I haven't had a chance to tell you before but Ian and I went
211,to Rome also. 
212,"VICKI: What? I, I "
213,BARBARA: I'll tell you all about it when you wake up. 
214,VICKI: I'm not sure whether you're making it up or not. I'll ask Ian.
215,He'll tell me. 
216,BARBARA: Well you do that. He'll be back soon. 
217,VICKI: Back? He's gone outside? 
218,[Planet surface]
219,
220, (The Doctor is examining a large rock) 
221,"DOCTOR: Well, well, well. That is remarkable. Gracious. During all my"
222,"travels, I don't think I've ever come across this. Magical. Isn't it"
223,"extraordinary? I say, are you there, Chesterton? Chesterton? What are"
224,"you doing, dear boy? Fiddling and gaping over there. Come over here and"
225,"learn something. Look here, do you see what this is? Mica, hmm? "
226,"IAN: Yes, it's one of the silicates. "
227,DOCTOR: Capable of withstanding great heat. 
228,IAN: Quite. 
229,"DOCTOR: Have you got something sharp I can have for a moment, hmm? "
230,IAN: Oh. Try my pen. 
231,(He takes out a pen which immediately disappears) 
232,"DOCTOR: That's very clever. Very clever. You know, you've never done"
233,that before. That's a remarkable conjuring trick. 
234,"IAN: That was no conjuring trick, Doctor. That was my pen. It vanished"
235,into thin air. 
236,"DOCTOR: Oh, my dear man. "
237,IAN: Vanished! 
238,(Echoes.) Vanished vanished vanished vanished 
239,"IAN: Yes, my gold pen! "
240,(Echoes.) Pen Vanished My gold pen Vanished. 
241,DOCTOR: Gold. 
242,IAN: What is it Doctor? 
243,"DOCTOR: Echoes, dear boy! "
244,IAN: I don't mean that. I mean this place. I have a feeling. 
245,DOCTOR: Hmm? What sort of feeling? 
246,IAN: I have a feeling we're being watched. Haven't you? 
247,"DOCTOR: No. No, no, no, no, I can't see any spooks or anything. I don't"
248,"think so, no. Not particularly, no. I must say that if I lived here and"
249,"I heard you roaring your head off, I'd probably come down and take a"
250,look at you. 
251,IAN: Then take my pen? 
252,"DOCTOR: Yes, what if the power's that's got hold of the Tardis has"
253,"taken your pen? Of course! Ha ha! Now then, there's something for us to"
254,"solve. Come along, come along, come along. "
255, [Tardis]
256,
257," (Barbara is doing her spring-cleaning, and pauses"
258,to watch the Doctor and Ian on the scanner. Her left arm is briefly
259,pulled towards the door)
260,
261, [Women's bedroom]
262,
263, VICKI: Barbara? 
264,"BARBARA: Oh, sorry, did I wake you? "
265,VICKI: No. The others back yet? 
266,"BARBARA: No, not yet. "
267,VICKI: Is something wrong? 
268,BARBARA: No. Why? 
269,VICKI: Don't know. You seem nervous. 
270,"BARBARA: Oh, there's there's something about this place. "
271,VICKI: I know. I wished we'd materialised in some really luxurious
272,"place, you know. Lots of lovely things to buy and eat and wear. "
273,(Barbara's arm gets pulled towards the door again) 
274,VICKI: Is your arm hurting? 
275,"BARBARA: No. Vicki, I know this sounds silly, but it doesn't feel as"
276,though it belongs to me. A little while ago it moved without my
277,"intending it to. Well, it's those things we don't understand that"
278,frighten us. I'm sure there's a perfectly simple explanation. I'm just
279,letting my imag 
280,(Barbara breaks off and leaves the room)
281,
282, [Planet surface]
283,
284," IAN: Doctor, look. "
285,(It's a pyramid) 
286,IAN: That was built. 
287,"DOCTOR: Yes, but when? It's old, so old. Look at the state it's in. "
288,(they walk up to it) 
289,DOCTOR: It's a pity we didn't bring a ladder with us. We might be able
290,to see what's on the top. 
291,"IAN: Well, it isn't Nelson. "
292,"DOCTOR: No. No, pity. Well, it certainly has nothing to do with holding"
293,"the ship here, dear boy."
294,"IAN: Curious, though. "
295,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's curious. Yes, yes, yes, but we must find something"
296,"more tangible, hmm? Come along, come along. "
297,"IAN: Oh, Doctor. Look. "
298,(a small pool) 
299,"IAN: It must be water. Any form of life would need that, hey? "
300,"DOCTOR: Wait, wait, stop. "
301,IAN: What's the matter? 
302,DOCTOR: You're a little premature. Let's have your tie. 
303,"IAN: Well, I haven't got one. "
304,"DOCTOR: I know you're not wearing one, dear boy, but the one round your"
305,"middle, hmm? "
306,IAN: I hope my pants stay up. 
307,"DOCTOR: Yes, well that's your affair, not mine. "
308,(Ian removes his tie-belt) 
309,IAN: There you are. 
310,DOCTOR: Thank you. Now then. 
311,IAN: Huh? 
312,DOCTOR: Yes. Let's see. 
313,(The Doctor lowers the tie into the pool.) 
314,IAN: Just a minute! 
315,(The tie begins to smoke.) 
316,"DOCTOR: There you are. Look, See that? Yes, there you are. You see? "
317,"IAN: Yes, I do see. You've ruined it. That was my Coal Hill School tie."
318,"You've just, er "
319,"DOCTOR: Saved your life. You were about to have a wash in there,"
320,"weren't you, or probably drink some of it? We very nearly had the"
321,remnants of a Coal Hill School teacher in there instead of his wretched
322,"old, ragged old tie. "
323,IAN: Never mind about that. What is it? 
324,"DOCTOR: Yes, let's see now. Now, what have we got, hmm? Echoes."
325,"Interference. Gold. And now, acid. Yes, similar properties to formic"
326,"acid. Yes, it's strange, isn't it? It's very strange. "
327,"(Ian throws the remains of his tie back towards the pool, and a stone"
328,plops into the liquid from above. A mega-ant ducks out of sight) 
329,"IAN: Doctor! There! There's something in there! I saw a light, it it"
330,broke the surface. 
331,DOCTOR: A light? Is it a reflection from a planet? 
332,"IAN: No, no. It was in there. I saw something in there, I tell you. "
333,"DOCTOR: Now, my young man. If this is your idea of revenge for that tie"
334,then I think it's a pretty poor effort. 
335,"IAN: Doctor, this is not revenge, I "
336,"DOCTOR: Now listen, we came here to find out the source of"
337,interference. Now I suggest we keep our minds on this subject. You're
338,rambling on. Come along. That's it. 
339,(The mega-ant sound starts up) 
340,"IAN: What is it, Doctor?"
341,
342, [Tardis]
343,
344, (Barbara is trying to block out the sound with her
345,"hands. Then the Tardis doors open, the console starts revolving, and"
346,her bracelet is tugged at) 
347,BARBARA: No! 
348,"(Finally, like a sleepwalker, Barbara leaves the Tardis and the doors"
349,close behind her)
350,
351, [Planet surface]
352,
353," IAN: You mean, the noises are messages? "
354,"DOCTOR: It probably comes from some sentient thing, or a machine"
355,operated by it. We must find the source of this interference. Now come
356,on.
357,
358, [Women's bedroom]
359,

361,gently)

370,
371, ECHOES: Barbara. Barbara. 
372,IAN: That's Vicki. Something's wrong back at the ship. 
373,DOCTOR: They've probably left the doors open. Come on. 
374,"(They run, Ian ahead of the Doctor, when) "
375,DOCTOR: Look out! 
376,(Ian gets snared in a net that comes up from the ground) 
377,"IAN: Doctor! Don't come near, Doctor! Go back to the ship! Go back to"
378,the ship! 
379,"(Meanwhile, Barbara is sleepwalking towards the acid pool) "
380,DOCTOR: Stand still. 
381,IAN: It stings and hurts! 
382,DOCTOR: I'll go back to the ship and try and find something. Can you
383,wait? 
384,"IAN: Yes, all right! "
385, [Tardis]
386,
387," (The Tardis lurches, nearly throwing Vicki to the"
388,floor. She grabs the console and starts flicking switches. We hear the
389,dematerialisation sound)

400,the acid pool at the last moment and walk around it instead)

404,DOCTOR: Ian. 
405,IAN: Ahh! Don't touch me! 
406,"DOCTOR: Are you all right, boy? "
407,"IAN: Oh, my face. my face. What's the matter with it? "
408,DOCTOR: It's a little blistered. 
409,"IAN: Oh, it's feels as is I fell into a bed of stinging nettles. "
410,"DOCTOR: What's happened to that weed, hmm? "
411,IAN: I don't know. It just went. 
412,DOCTOR: Went where? 
413,"IAN: Well, it just went. Into the air, into the ground. Oh, what a"
414,cursed place this is. 
415,"DOCTOR: Yes, a cursed place. So barren. I wonder. Yes, cursed. "
416,"IAN: Come on, Doctor. Let's get back to the Tardis. Get something for"
417,my face. 
418,"DOCTOR: Oh, unfortunately, I can't help you at the moment, dear boy. "
419,IAN: What? 
420,DOCTOR: And I have a shock for you. The ship's gone. Vanished.
421,"(Meanwhile, Barbara is now being followed by a giant winged insect.) "
422,"DOCTOR: There must be an answer to it, dear boy. There must be answer!"
423,"They can't even get in the ship, let alone operate it. The interior of"
424,my ship is inviolable. 
425,(The Doctor suddenly clutches at his chest) 
426,IAN: What's the matter? 
427,DOCTOR: It's my chest. 
428,IAN: Can't you breathe? 
429,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. "
430,IAN: Something wrong with these? 
431,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's these ADJ coats are no use. After about an hour,"
432,they're useless. 
433,IAN: Can we live without them? 
434,DOCTOR: Just about. 
435,"IAN: Let's take them off, shall we? Get used to the atmosphere, okay?"
436,All right? 
437,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes. "
438,(Ian takes the jacket off) 
439,"IAN: You can certainly tell the difference, can't you. Breathe slowly."
440,"Deeply, like a diver. Oh, it it's possible. Okay? "
441,"DOCTOR: There, do you see those ridges? What are those ridges in the"
442,sand there? Have a look. 
443,IAN: The Tardis. 
444,DOCTOR: I heard the Tardis. 
445,IAN: It's been dragged away. Dragged away! 
446,"(and just to prove it, we see the Tardis travelling along, seemingly"
447,"under its own power, but accompanied by the mega-ant noises) "

457,and guides her into a cave where there are others of its kind)

462,bracelet and throws it into a pool of acid. Barbara wakes up)

472,"DOCTOR: Oh, all so strange, so unnatural. I've never experienced"
473,anything in my life before like this. But we must continue with our
474,search. 
475,IAN: Yeah. 
476,"DOCTOR: Take a look over there. Well, that's odd. Those are not track"
477,marks. Those are more like claw marks. Yes. Chesterton! 
478,(Ian has just put his foot in an insect pupae) 
479,IAN: Doctor. 
480,"DOCTOR: I think we're on the right track, my boy. "
481,IAN: Never mind about that. Look at this. 
482,DOCTOR: Good gracious. It's hollow. 
483,IAN: Yes. 
484,"DOCTOR: Yes, well preserved. Yes, a vertebrate creature, yes, highly"
485,"developed, hmm! "
486,IAN: But it's skin is more like a chrysalis. 
487,"DOCTOR: Menoptra. Yes, does that word mean anything to you, hmm? "
488,"IAN: No, nothing. You mean you've been here before? "
489,"DOCTOR: No, no, my boy. No, but it's this rock formation and now this"
490,"creature, this object, it suggests the planet Vortis. "
491,IAN: Vortis? What galaxy is that in? 
492,"DOCTOR: The Isop galaxy. Yes, many light years from Earth. And yet the"
493,"Vortis hasn't the moon's and here, there there are several. Look, you"
494,see? You can see for yourself. 
495,"IAN: Yes. Can't a planet attract satellites to itself, Doctor? "
496,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, yes, but it would need a galactic explosion, you"
497,"know, some kind of new force. Whether this Vortis planet has that or"
498,"not, I can't be sure. Anyway, lets, come on, over here. "

510,VRESTIN: (female) No.

512,HROSTAR: (a male) You chose here when you chose to land on Vortis? 
513,"BARBARA: I keep telling you, we didn't choose. Our ship was forced"
514,here. 
515,VRESTIN: The Zarbi will treat them as enemies. If we refuse to help
516,"them, they will not survive. "
517,"HRHOONDA: Her future is no concern of ours. Hrostar, she was under the"
518,force of the Zarbi. Why did you break it? 
519,"BARBARA: Look, all we want to do is get away from here. These Zarbi"
520,"that you seem frightened of, maybe we could help you? "
521,HROSTAR: Have you any weapons? 
522,"BARBARA: No, but we "
523,VRESTIN: Watch her. 
524,"HRHOONDA: If we let her go, she may tell the Zarbi where they can find"
525,us. 
526,VRESTIN: No. 
527,"HRHOONDA: Even if she does not wish to betray us, they will extort it"
528,from her. 
529,VRESTIN: There are few of us and many of the Zarbi. She offers help. 
530,HRHOONDA: She is not to be trusted. I say kill her. 
531,VRESTIN: Hrostar. The Menoptra do not act without

541,DOCTOR: Pulsating. 
542,IAN: Do you think they could be natural like the aurora borealis? 
543,"DOCTOR: No, look down there, my boy, hmm? "
544,IAN: So that's where they've taken the ship to. 
545,DOCTOR: Apparently so. We've got to get down there. I wish we had more
546,"knowledge of what we were up against. Ah, this wilderness. "
547,IAN: Doctor! 
548,"(They are surrounded by Zarbi, and woodlice, which are very curious"
549,about them) 
550,DOCTOR: The best thing is just to stand still. 
551,"IAN: Maybe we could talk to them, make them understand? "
552,DOCTOR: Apart from rubbing our back legs together like some sort of
553,grasshopper? I doubt if we could get on speaking terms with them. Stand
554,still! Obey! These creatures on this planet are completely unknown to
555,me. Just stand still and obey.

725,ANIMUS : She has been taken to the Crater of Needles beyond my

763,"DOCTOR: Well, to use the term of Earth, I suppose we should call them"
764,insects. 
765,IAN: Ants? I've seen a colony of ants eat their way right through a
766,"house. That size, they could eat their way through a mountain. Why are"
767,they that big? 
768,"DOCTOR: Size is only relative. In this rarified atmosphere, it appears"
769,that evolution has chosen that particular form of life on this planet. 
770,IAN: Ants. 
771,DOCTOR: Yes.

793,experience with breathing as we have. 
794,IAN: Mmm. Hold on a minute.

803,ANIMUS : You have the information? 
804,"DOCTOR: No, good gracious me, no. Some kind of force of yours has"

915,VRESTIN: You do not know our story? 
916,"IAN: No, I don't. Tell me. "
917,"VRESTIN: The Zarbi are not an intelligent species, but they were"
918,"essential to the life pattern here. We lived at peace with them, until"
919,they were made militant by the dark power. 
920,IAN: The dark power? What's that? 
921,"VRESTIN: The Animus. At that time, the Carsinome appeared. Grew like a"
922,fungus. We had no weapons. We had not had the need. And by the time we
923,"sensed the danger, the Zarbi were too strong. "
924,IAN: So you left the planet? 
925,VRESTIN: We had no choice. 
926,IAN: Where did you go? 
927,"VRESTIN: At that time, these strange moons appeared. One of them became"
928,"our home, those of us who could reach it. "
929,IAN: Can you live up there? 
930,"VRESTIN: It is a dim, half-world and our wings grow weaker. We must"
931,"return to Vortis, for when the Carsinome encircles the planet, it will"
932,be too late. 
933,IAN: And now you're ready to attack? 
934,"VRESTIN: No, we are not ready, but we must try. "
935,IAN: I see. And what's your part in all this? 
936,VRESTIN: Three of us were sent here to prepare the way for the invasion
937,"force. Now, I am alone. I do not know. "
938,IAN: What happened to the other two? 
939,(Vrestin whimpers.) 
940,IAN: They were killed. 
941,VRESTIN: One is dead. The other was taken to the Crater 
942,IAN: (Crater of Needles. 
943,VRESTIN: Friend Barbara? 
944,"IAN: Yes, like friend Barbara. Vrestin, we've both lost friends. Come"
945,with me to the Crater. You know the country. We can collect your friend
946,and mine. 
947,VRESTIN: There are many of my friends in the Crater of Needles. 
948,IAN: All the more reason to go.

986,BARBARA: Are your wings healed? 
987,HROSTAR: I shall never fly again. 
988,BARBARA: No. Why do they make us do 
989,(A Zarbi approaches and they start work again. It leaves.) 
990,BARBARA: Why do they make us heap this vegetation into the acid
991,streams? 
992,"HROSTAR: It is the raw material for the Carsinome, where the Zarbi"
993,"live. Fed into these pools, it is drawn to the centre through"
994,"underground streams, and as we pour it in, the Carsinome grows and"
995,reaches out across Vortis. 
996,"BARBARA: Well, what lies at the centre? "
997,"HROSTAR: None of us have ever seen it and lived, but we call it the"
998,Animus. 
999,(A Zarbi harries them again) 
1000,BARBARA: Do you understand them? 
1001,HROSTAR: No. They are just cattle. They do not have any speech nor
1002,motive of their own. Just controlled sentries. We came here to liberate
1003,"them. It was disaster. Vrestin, the others, we arrived in advance of"
1004,the spearhead. Our weapons proved useless. They were taken by the Zarbi
1005,who were everywhere. The three of us you met in the cave got away with
1006,"the communicator, but we could not contact our spearhead. "
1007,"BARBARA: Well, when is it due to arrive? "
1008,HROSTAR: Soon. 
1009,BARBARA: And how will you overcome the Animus? 
1010,HROSTAR: With a new invention of our scientists. It has not been tested
1011,but we have placed our faith in the Isop-tope.

1018,of here? 
1019,"DOCTOR: Because I think we might find it more valuable later on, child,"
1020,when Ian and Barbara have returned.

1031,have located your enemy. My calculations are complete. 
1032,ANIMUS : You lie. 
1033,DOCTOR: The Menoptra are massing on the planet Pictos. 
1034,ANIMUS : Pictos? 
1035,DOCTOR: It appears they are heading straight for Vortis. If you waste
1036,"time in idle vengeance, in face of such an invasion, you will all be"
1037,annihilated. 
1038,ANIMUS : Where will the Menoptra land? 
1039,"DOCTOR: If I am given peace of mind for a while, I can find that out."
1040,"That is, if it's not too late. "
1041,ANIMUS : Go.

1051,"VICKI: Did, did you tell that thing where the Menoptra are going to"

1053,"DOCTOR: Just about enough for our survival. If I tell them everything,"

1055,want to find a place to hide this recorder. I don't propose to make

1093,HLYNIA: Do nothing? But we've waited for generations for this moment. 
1094,"HROSTAR: And it will come, but a false move and all is lost. Success"
1095,"depended on surprise. If this is an alert, how did they know? Your"

1100,BARBARA: Know what? 
1101,"HROSTAR: Our spearhead plan to land on Sayo Plateau, just above the"
1102,"crater here, to the north. "
1103,"BARBARA: Well, that doesn't mean to say that the Doctor told them. The"
1104,"Zarbi must be alerted everywhere, not just here. "
1105,"HROSTAR: With the Zarbi weaponry, they will be massacred. "
1106,BARBARA: Are your forces armed? 
1107,HROSTAR: With useless weapons. Our plan was for an attack on the
1108,"Animus. We would have landed in secret, overcome the Zarbi, and"
1109,destroyed the force that rules them by sheer force of numbers. 
1110,BARBARA: A suicide army. 
1111,HROSTAR: It would have been suicide to stay where we were. The invasion
1112,"had to come now. We did not choose the time. It is now, and failure"
1113,will mean failure for all time. 
1114,"PRAPILLUS: Hrostar, the spearhead must be warned. "

1120,PRAPILLUS: We know.

1122,I do not think there will be many more left to guard us. 
1123,"BARBARA: Look, we must try. It only needs one of us to get through. "

1351,"HLYNIA: There was a tunnel on the lower ledge where you left me. What,"
1352,what happened on the plateau? 
1353,HROSTAR: The spearhead has failed. 
1354,HILIO: No! The spearhead must succeed. Which is the way back to the
1355,Plateau? I will recall my force. 
1356,"PRAPILLUS: No, Hilio. "
1357,"BARBARA: (What force? From what I saw of the battle, your spearhead was"
1358,completely wiped out.

1360,PRAPILLUS: Our ally. 
1361,HILIO: I do not trust her. 
1362,BARBARA: You have no choice. 
1363,"HLYNIA: Hrostar, Prapillus, what shall we do? "
1364,HILIO: Is it true? Are they all dead? 
1365,"PRAPILLUS: Dead, or prisoners by now. "
1366,HILIO: Then our main force cannot know where to land. They too will be
1367,massacred. The Menoptra will be no more. 
1368,"PRAPILLUS: Hilio, the Menoptra have no wisdom for war. Before the"
1369,"Animus came, the flower forest covered the planet in a cocoon of peace."
1370,"Our ancestors carved temples like this for resting places of our dead,"
1371,but that was all the work we did. There were no other plans to make.
1372,"Light was our God and we existed in light, flying above thought. Our"
1373,"banishment has taught us of enemies and weapons, and my captivity has"
1374,"taught me strategy. They tore my wings from me and I felt, as you feel,"
1375,"that all was lost. But if our Gods favour our survival, we must learn"
1376,their lesson and use our brains and not our wings. This Earth woman we
1377,"must trust, for she can show us how to exist without wings, to survive"
1378,and flourish. What should we do? 
1379,"BARBARA: Well, what would have happened if the spearhead had been"
1380,successful? 
1381,"HROSTAR: Had we met with no resistance, we were to proceed to the"
1382,centre of the web and destroy the Animus. 
1383,BARBARA: How? 
1384,HILIO: With this. Our wise men designed it for use against the
1385,intelligence. 
1386,PRAPILLUS: A living cell destructor? 
1387,"HILIO: Yes. The web, and the living thing behind it, grows and spreads"
1388,its evil around Vortis. This destructor would have reversed the
1389,"process, made the cells grow inwards and die. "
1390,HLYNIA: The electron guns failed to work against the Zarbi. Would this
1391,have failed too? 
1392,"BARBARA: Well, there's only one way to find out. "
1393,PRAPILLUS: Attack the Animus. Can we reach it? 
1394,HILIO: It cannot work now. We are too few. 
1395,"BARBARA: The only alternative is to stay here, perhaps for years. "
1396,HROSTAR: Both ways may mean our death. But hope lies in action.

1783, [Animus Chamber] 
1784, ANIMUS: Zarbi centre wounded! Aliens in control.
1785,
1786,[Control room]
1787,
1788, PRAPILLUS: This sector seems to be paralysed. 
1789,"BARBARA: Oh look, this is the Doctor's astral map. "
1790,PRAPILLUS: Does it work? 
1791,"BARBARA: Yes, I think so. "
1792,PRAPILLUS: Can we speak to the invasion force with it? 
1793,"BARBARA: Yes, if I can just find the right frequency. Where would you"
1794,want it set? 
1795,"PRAPILLUS: To the planet Pictos, there. "
1796,"BARBARA: Now, try that. "
1797,"PRAPILLUS: Vortis to main force. Vortis to main force. Warning, repeat,"
1798,"warning, Electron guns useless against the Zarbi. Isop Plateau heavily"
1799,ambushed. Wait for instructions. Reply. 
1800,"HILIO: Either it hasn't heard, or it doesn't trust us. "
1801,"BARBARA: Or I didn't set it right. I don't know, there's something"
1802,"wrong. This thing ought to light. Prapillus, look. It's the Isop-tope."
1803,"The Doctor, he must have been captured. "
1804,HILIO: Then we must take it to the centre ourselves. 
1805,BARBARA: But why would 
1806,HILIO: There's no time to lose. 
1807,PRAPILLUS: Hilio will take care of the Doctor. 
1808,BARBARA: Hilio. 
1809,PRAPILLUS: Hurry!
1810,
1811,[Under the Animus]
1812,
1813,(The surface above is organic and yielding) 
1814,IAN: Give me this. 
1815,(Ian takes Hetra's spear and tries to cut through the roof) 
1816,IAN: It's like trying to cut your way through treacle. 
1817,HETRA: The blind mouth of Poidarac will not let us through. 
1818,"VRESTIN: Heron, try."
1819,
1820,[Carsinome Corridor]
1821,
1822," HILIO: Remember, the Destructor must be aimed at"
1823,the dark side of the Animus. 
1824,PRAPILLUS: Zarbi! There's no turning back. We must rush them. It only
1825,needs one of us to get through with the Destructor. 
1826,HILIO: Now! 
1827,PRAPILLUS: Zarbi! 
1828,HILIO: Barbara! 
1829,"(Hilio throws the Isop-tope to Barbara, distracting the Zarbi so he and"
1830,"Prapillus can get through, followed by Hylnia) "
1831,HLYNIA: Barbara! Barbara! Barbara! 
1832,(Barbara then throws it to Hlynia and she gets through too) 
1833,BARBARA: They're not following us. 
1834,PRAPILLUS: Perhaps we were expected? 
1835,HILIO: This must be the centre. Give me the Isop-tope.

1837,[Animus Chamber]
1838,
1839,(They rush in and are stunned by the sudden bright
1840,light) 
1841,PRAPILLUS: Light! 
1842,ANIMUS: All of you. 
1843,HLYNIA: Light! Light! Light! 
1844,"PRAPILLUS: No, Hlynia, not this light! It is evil. "
1845,"HILIO: Barbara, the Destructor. Take it! "
1846,"VICKI: Barbara? Oh, Barbara! "
1847,BARBARA: The dark side. I must aim it at the dark side. 
1848,"ANIMUS: Approach. Approach, Earth people. Your struggles are futile. "
1849,BARBARA: It doesn't work! It doesn't work! 
1850,ANIMUS: Escape is impossible. Impossible. 
1851,"(Behind the Animus, a familiar figure climbs up through the floor) "
1852,BARBARA: Ian! 
1853,ANIMUS: You are expected too. You have not the power. 
1854,"(Barbara falls, with the Isop-tope pointing upwards, and the Animus"
1855,sounds worried.) 
1856,ANIMUS: Power. Master them. Master them! The universe! 
1857,"(The light goes, smoke pours out of the source and the creature"
1858,"collapses on top of it, dead) "

1867,"HILIO: Hlynia. Water. Drink, Hlynia. "
1868,HLYNIA: Vicki. Vicki. Vicki. Vicki. 
1869,VICKI: What is it? 
1870,HLYNIA: Water! 
1871,VICKI: It is! Why does it appear now? 
1872,"HILIO: Before the Animus, water flowed freely on Vortis. Now the evil"
1873,"is gone, our streams run pure again. Our vegetation will flourish."
1874,VICKI: Barbara. 
1875,(Barbara is playing with a larva) 
1876,"VICKI: Barbara, come and look. Water. "
1877,VRESTIN: Be strong. Be strong. The light is very good. 
1878,HETRA: We fly like you? 
1879,"VRESTIN: No, but your children may fly. "
1880,HETRA: We see. 
1881,"(Hetra tries flapping his tiny arms, and falls) "
1882,VRESTIN: Be patient. 
1883,"HETRA: Without flight, how will the gods of light be kind to my people?"
1884,
1885,VRESTIN: Vortis is strong by thought. We will work together. 
1886,"PRAPILLUS: If I had not lived til this time, I would have counted my"
1887,"life entirely wasted. Doctor, we owe you a great deal. "
1888,"DOCTOR: There's only one thing you owe me, my friend. "
1889,PRAPILLUS: And what is that? 
1890,"DOCTOR: That is my ring, hmm? "
1891,"PRAPILLUS: Your ring? Your ring, on my life. "
1892,"DOCTOR: Thank you, thank you. "
1893,"IAN: Well, they seem to be enjoying themselves up here. "
1894,VRESTIN: The light is good. 
1895,HETRA: Light is good. 
1896,"VRESTIN: Heron, will you come back to Vortis? "
1897,"IAN: Oh, I doubt it, Vrestin. But, knowing the Doctor, you can never be"
1898,sure. 
1899,"PRAPILLUS: Vrestin, have you mended the communicator? "
1900,"DOCTOR: Well, my boy, we've managed to come out of this knot unscathed."
1901,
1902,IAN: Yes. All except my old school tie. 
1903,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's quite a problem, isn't it. It's something to do with"
1904,"coal, wasn't it? "
1905,IAN: Coal Hill School. An old Coal Hill School tie. Black with thin
1906,emerald green stripes on it. 
1907,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, quite so. Quite so. Come on. "
1908,"IAN: Barbara, Vicki. "
1909,"(One by one they enter the Tardis, and it dematerialises) "
1910,HLYNIA: It disappeared! 
1911,PRAPILLUS: Their deeds shall be sung in the Temples of Light. Pictos
1912,shall remind us of a time as it circles Vortis. Every time it points to
1913,"the Needle of the Kings, as it does now, then we shall weave songs to"
1914,praise the gods of light and thank them that they sent the Earth people
1915,"to save us from the Animus. Now the Zarbi larvae feed the soil, the"
1916,flower forest shall grow again across Vortis. But we must not allow the
1917,forest to conceal another lurking Animus. Welcome the main force. 
1918,"VRESTIN: Vortis to main force, Vortis to main force. "
1919,"MENOPTRA : Main force to Vortis. Main force to Vortis. Vrestin,"
1920,where shall we land? 
1921,VRESTIN: The dark power is dead. Fly in Menoptra to the delta of
1922,lights. We are waiting.
