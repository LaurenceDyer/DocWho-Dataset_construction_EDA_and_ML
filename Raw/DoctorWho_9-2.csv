20,One 
21, [Throne room] 
22, (It is a dark and stormy night on a distant
23,planet. The castle appears to have been carved halfway up the steep
24,"sides of a mountain, yet still boasts impressive battlements and"
25,crenellations. It's passages are lit by flaming torches and its guards
26,"are semi-clad in leather, and hold pikestaffs. A man in a flowing cloak"
27,enters and bows to the young king and his advisor. Everyone say Hi! to
28,"Patrick Troughton's son, David.) "
29,"TORBIS: The delegate from Alpha Centauri has arrived, your Majesty. He"
30,will present his credentials to you shortly. 
31,"PELADON: Thank you, Torbis. "
32,TORBIS: We wait now only for the chairman delegate from Earth. Then the
33,discussions can begin. 
34,"(A taller man wearing the same blue robes, and with the same white hair"
35,"and beard with brown stripe across the top of the head, speaks.) "
36,HEPESH: You will persist then in this folly? Nothing I can say will
37,deter you? 
38,"TORBIS: Hepesh, you have already had your say in the Grand Council. The"
39,question has been discussed and decided. 
40,"HEPESH: Decided by you, Torbis, and the fools who support you! You"
41,"mislead the King, you abandon the ancient ways of our people. "
42,TORBIS: Nothing but ignorance and superstition. 
43,HEPESH: You will bring the curse of Aggedor upon us! 
44,TORBIS: It'll take much more than your childish mumbo-jumbo to frighten
45,me. 
46,PELADON: Enough! I will not have my Chancellor and my High Priest
47,squabbling on the steps of the throne. 
48,"HEPESH: You Majesty is right to rebuke us, nevertheless I must persist "
49,"TORBIS: Must I remind you, Priest "
50,PELADON: My friends! My good friends. You are more to me than my
51,"Chancellors, my regents, much more. It grieves my heart to hear such"
52,hate between two brothers. 
53,"TORBIS: May I speak, your Majesty? "
54,PELADON: Very well. 
55,TORBIS: It was not I who chose to quarrel. Ever since the death of his
56,"exalted Majesty, your father, I have been as a parent to you. If you"
57,"should forget now all that I have ever taught you, if you should let"
58,the superstitious fear of this foolish man 
59,HEPESH: The folly has not been mine but yours. 
60,"TORBIS: Your Majesty, my whole life would be a failure. As a sacred"
61,"trust, I undertook to "
62,HEPESH: Sacred trust? 
63,"PELADON: Hepesh, please! Torbis, I shall not betray you. "
64,HEPESH: But sire! 
65,"PELADON: No, Hepesh! The decision has been taken. If the committee of"
66,"assessment judges favourably, then Peladon will join the Galactic"
67,Federation. And I shall expect your loyal help and support at this
68,difficult time. 
69,HEPESH: Your Majesty. 
70,"PELADON: Torbis, please inform the others that Alpha Centauri has"
71,arrived. 
72,"(Torbis leaves, and strides along the corridor until a large shadow"
73,falls across him. He looks up and tries to protect himself as it roars.
74,"A guard, Peladon and Hepesh hear the sound and run out of the throne"
75,room.)
76,
77,[Corridor]
78,
79," (The guard gets to Torbis first, then he too is"
80,attacked by the large something before it retreats and Peladon
81,arrives.) 
82,PELADON: Torbis! Torbis! 
83,"HEPESH: Grun, what happened? What happened, Grun? "
84,"(The guard, Grun, is a mute. He points at an emblem on a torch sconce.)"
85,
86,"HEPESH: So, the spirit of Aggedor has risen again. The ancient curse of"
87,Peladon will be fulfilled.
88,
89, [Tardis]
90,
91, (The Tardis has materialised on a small ledge some
92,way below the castle. The Doctor has exchanged his velvet jacket and
93,"cloak for plaid ones, and Jo looks like she's going to a debutante's"
94,ball.) 
95,"DOCTOR: There you are, Jo. A perfect landing. "
96,JO: And about time too. 
97,"DOCTOR: Now, now, Miss Grant. Let's not be impatient. "
98,"JO: Impatient? Look, I'm all dolled up. I'm all dolled up for a night"
99,out on the town with Mike Yates when you talk me into a joyride in this
100,thing. 
101,"DOCTOR: It's hardly a joyride, Jo. This is the Tardis' first test"
102,flight since I got it working again. 
103,"JO: Yes, I know, but you said we'd only. You said we'd only be a few"
104,"minutes, right? "
105,DOCTOR: Mmm hmm. 
106,"JO: Well we've been simply ages. Look, I'm going to be very late, so if"
107,"you'll just open the doors and let me out, I'll be "
108,"DOCTOR: One minute, Jo. Routine landing procedures first, eh? Let's see"
109,what the scanners have to tell us. 
110,JO: Precisely nothing. 
111,DOCTOR: Must be on the blink. 
112,JO: I might have expected it. The Tardis always is. 
113,DOCTOR: I hope you're as in good condition when you're as old as she
114,is. 
115,(The Doctor takes a component from the underside of the console.) 
116,"DOCTOR: Now, let's have a look. Yes. Yes, there's a tiny fault in the"
117,"interstitial beam synthesiser. Still, I can put that right later. "
118,(The Doctor puts the component in his pocket.) 
119,JO: Doctor? 
120,DOCTOR: Mmm hmm? 
121,JO: You're sure we're back at base? 
122,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, everything outside seems perfectly normal."
123,"Atmosphere, temperature, gravity. Yeah. Cheer up, Jo. It's a perfect"
124,landing. 
125,(The Tardis suddenly tilts.) 
126,JO: You did say perfect? 
127, [Outside the Tardis] 
128," (The ledge is half as wide as the Tardis, which is"
129,"being buffeted by the strong winds. Luckily, or otherwise, the Tardis"
130,has landed with her doors opening onto the ledge. The Doctor jumps out
131,and looks straight down the precipice.) 
132,"JO : Doctor, what's the matter? Where are we? "
133,"DOCTOR: Well, we seem to be half way up a mountain. We're balanced on"
134,the edge. 
135,"JO : Well, what are we going to do? "
136,"DOCTOR: Come towards me. Come on! Now, give me your hand, very, very"
137,gently! Ready now? 
138,JO: Yes! 
139,"DOCTOR: Right, jump! "
140,(Jo leaps into the Doctor's arms and the Tardis now tumbles down the
141,mountainside.) 
142,JO: It's smashed to pieces! 
143,"DOCTOR: Jo, the Tardis may have its faults, but it is indestructible."
144,Our main worry is how to get to it. We certainly can't climb down
145,"there. Jo! Jo, look up there! "
146,"JO: Oo, looks a bit doomy. "
147,"DOCTOR: Well, we certainly can't recover the Tardis by ourselves. We'd"
148,better get up there and see if we can find help. 
149,JO: Up there? 
150,"DOCTOR: Yeah, that's right. "
151,JO: But I'm not exactly dressed for mountaineering. 
152,"DOCTOR: Well, you could always wait here, I suppose. "
153,"JO: No thanks. Anyway, we don't even know where we are. "
154,"DOCTOR: Exactly. So the sooner we find out, the better. Come on."
155,
156, [Throne room]
157,
158," (A non-humanoid enters. It is upright, green, with"
159,"one large eye above the frill of its cloak, and six grasping appendages"
160,round its thorax.) 
161,"HEPESH: The delegate from Alpha Centauri, member of the Galactic"
162,"Federation, presents his credentials before his Majesty, King Peladon. "
163,PELADON: Peladon welcomes the delegate from Alpha Centauri. 
164,"(Although described as he, Alpha Centauri speaks with an extremely"
165,high-pitched voice and a tendency to bounce up and down.) 
166,"ALPHA: As a member of the preliminary assessment commission, I have"
167,great hopes that your planet will be acceptable as a candidate for the
168,Galactic Federation. 
169,PELADON: That is my firm intention. My Chancellor will (pause) My High
170,Priest will give you all assistance to this end. 
171,"HEPESH: We willing accept the hands of true friendship. Unfortunately,"
172,discussions cannot begin until the arrival of the chairman delegate
173,from Earth. 
174,"PELADON: He will be here soon, Hepesh, never fear. Earth is many light"
175,"years away from us? Is that not so, Alpha Centauri? "
176,"ALPHA: Indeed, your Majesty. (giggles) A remote and unattractive planet"
177,at best. 
178,HEPESH: I say again the omens are not good. 
179,PELADON: Hepesh. 
180,"HEPESH: Once before your Majesty saw fit to ignore my warnings, and now"
181,"your Chancellor, Torbis, lies dead, slain by the wrath of Aggedor. "
182,"PELADON: Hepesh, enough! "
183,ALPHA: Slain? Danger here? Then the conference must be cancelled! 
184,"PELADON: This is not a matter to trouble the delegates. Torbis, my"
185,"former Chancellor, died earlier tonight in mysterious circumstances."
186,"But the truth will be brought to light. Meanwhile, there is no danger"
187,to you or to your fellow delegates. 
188,ALPHA: I accept your Majesty's assurances. 
189,PELADON: Thank you. Lord Hepesh will take you to your fellow delegates.
190,
191, [Mountainside]
192,
193," (Amidst the thunder and lightning, the Doctor and"
194,Jo crawl up the rough steep slope where only a few scrawny clumps of
195,grass survive. They rest on a small ledge. Jo is out of breath.) 
196,JO: It's no good. I can't go any further. I nearly broke my neck coming
197,up this far. 
198,"DOCTOR: Well, we certainly can't stay here, Jo. I'll tell you what."
199,Let's traverse along this ledge for a bit. I'll see if there's another
200,way out. Have a look that way. 
201,JO: Okay. 
202,(They split up.) 
203,JO : Doctor! 
204,"DOCTOR: Yes, what is it? Jo? Jo, where are you? Jo, where are you? "
205,(Jo looks out of an opening in the rock.) 
206,JO: Over here! Come on! 
207,DOCTOR: What is it? 
208,JO: A tunnel. Come on.
209,
210, [Delegate's conference room]
211,
212, (A pair of doors decorated with the same face as
213,the torch sconce open.) 
214,HEPESH: This chamber is reserved for the delegate's private meetings. 
215,ARCTURUS: Greetings. You are the delegate from Alpha Centauri? (An
216,electronic voice comes from a head in a glass dome on top of a tank.
217,Liquid constantly flows down the inside of the dome.) 
218,HEPESH: The delegate from Arcturus. 
219,"ALPHA: Greetings, delegate. There has been an incident. A court"
220,official has been slain. 
221,ARCTURUS: Slain? There has been violence? I am in danger? 
222,"HEPESH: An internal matter, delegate Arcturus. Do not be concerned. "
223,"ARCTURUS: The delegation must be concerned, if only for its own safety."
224,
225,ALPHA: We are committed to the rejection of violence. 
226,"ARCTURUS: But we are capable of self defence, should it prove"
227,necessary. Allow me to demonstrate. 
228,(A small dish emerges from the bottom of the tank. There is a red flash
229,and an innocent decorated pot on a pedestal is destroyed.) 
230,"ARCTURUS: So, be warned. Do not provoke us. "
231,HEPESH: We desire only your friendship. 
232,ARCTURUS: Then make sure that our mission is not endangered.
233,
234, [Tunnel]
235,
236, (The Doctor and Jo come to a grill looking into a
237,room with flaming torches by a large stone statue of a creature with
238,raised claws.) 
239,"DOCTOR: Jo, come at look at this. "
240,JO: What on Earth is it? 
241,DOCTOR: It looks like some sort of shrine. 
242,JO: I've never seen anything like it before. 
243,"DOCTOR: No, neither have I. At least not on Earth. Come on."
244,
245, [Throne room]
246,
247, PELADON: I remember when you and Torbis first
248,brought me to this throne room. 
249,HEPESH: At first you refused to sit upon the throne. You said that
250,rightfully it could only be your father's place. 
251,PELADON: But Torbis lifted me up and set me here. And then you said 
252,"HEPESH: And then I said, though the royal blood that flows in your"
253,"veins is mingled with that of strangers, yet you shall be Peladon of"
254,"Peladon. Greater than your father, greater than any past or future"
255,king. And then the Earth woman 
256,"PELADON: And then my mother, Hepesh. She smiled and placed my left hand"
257,in yours and my right hand in Torbis's. 
258,HEPESH: And together we made a boy into a king. 
259,PELADON: And now Torbis is dead. 
260,"HEPESH: His task was almost done, as mine will be when once I have"
261,anointed you king. 
262,"PELADON: Why did he die, Hepesh? "
263,HEPESH: He saw your future as a servant of the Galactic Federation. I
264,see you as an independent ruler of a great and glorious kingdom. 
265,"PELADON: You really believe he was destroyed by Aggedor, don't you? "
266,"HEPESH: Yes, it was a warning. "
267,PELADON: But the Federation delegates are here at my invitation. It
268,should have been me that was struck down. 
269,"HEPESH: No. No, it was Torbis blind advice that would have destroyed"
270,"your kingdom. You would have become a slave, not a king. "
271,"PELADON: But Hepesh, you were always telling me a king must choose and"
272,choose courageously. 
273,HEPESH: Aggedor has shown the way. 
274,PELADON: Backwards into superstition? It was you who taught me to
275,"fight, to ride, and to think. Help me to realise my dream. I know what"
276,is best for my people. 
277,HEPESH: I do not trust these aliens. 
278,"PELADON: Well then, trust me. "
279,"HEPESH: I tell you, I know their minds. I will not let them lead you"
280,into a trap. 
281,PELADON: But their motives are open and honest. 
282,"HEPESH: But to them, Peladon, we are merely savages. Savages to be"
283,tamed. They despise and distrust us. 
284,"PELADON: Then I will talk to them, convince them. Summon the delegates."
285,"Now, Hepesh!"
286,
287, [Tunnel]
288,
289, JO: Which way now? 
290,"DOCTOR: Which way indeed? Eenie, meenie, mynie, mo. "
291,(Roar in the distance.) 
292,JO: Meenie? 
293,(They head away from the roar.) 
294,"JO: Oh no, it's blocked up. "
295,"DOCTOR: Yes. If the tunnel's never used, why is this torch still"
296,alight? 
297,(The Doctor grasps the sconce. It doesn't move down but it does move
298,"up, and a concealed door springs open.) "
299,"JO: Right again, Doctor."
300,
301, [Corridor]
302,
303,  (They peer around the side of a
304,tapestry.) 
305,JO: Where are we? 
306,"DOCTOR: Somewhere inside the castle, I should think. Let's take a look"
307,around. 
308,(There are footsteps so they duck back behind the tapestry as a
309,familiar scaly-armoured green figure hisses its way past. They follow
310,it to a corner.) 
311,JO: What was that? 
312,"DOCTOR: That, Jo, was an Ice Warrior. A native of the planet Mars. "
313,JO: You've seen them before? 
314,"DOCTOR: Yes, indeed I have, and believe me, they're not very pleasant"
315,company. 
316,"JO: Oh, come on, let's get back to the tunnel quickly. "
317,(But castle guards have arrived and now surround them.)
318,
319, [Throne room]
320,
321, (The Ice Warrior enters and is directed to its
322,"place by it's master, still green and permanently out of breath, but no"
323,scaly armour and a long cloak.) 
324,"PELADON: Thank you. By now, you all know of the tragic incident"
325,"involving my Chancellor, Torbis. He was more than an advisor. He was,"
326,"like Hepesh, a trusted friend. "
327,IZLYR: (the Ice Lord) And yet he was killed. Why? 
328,HEPESH: It was a supernatural warning. 
329,PELADON: My High Priest connects this death with one of our ancient
330,legends. 
331,ARCTURUS: Your Priest speaks of a warning. Perhaps it is more than
332,that. 
333,"PELADON: Superstition, nothing more. "
334,"IZLYR: This incident could well mean a threat to us, and to the"
335,Federation. 
336,PELADON: But it was Torbis who died. The legend only concerns my
337,people. 
338,"ALPHA: Your legend seems violent and unpleasant, and rather too"
339,convenient. 
340,HEPESH: The legend of the curse of Peladon has been handed down through
341,countless centuries. 
342,"IZLYR: I think, perhaps, we should hear this legend. "
343,"HEPESH: It concerns the royal beast of Peladon, now extinct. It is"
344,"written, Mighty is Aggedor, fiercest of all the beasts of Peladon."
345,Young men would hunt it to prove their courage. His fur trims our royal
346,garment. His head is our royal emblem. It is also written there will
347,come a day when the spirit of Aggedor will rise again to warn and
348,"defend his royal master, King Peladon. For at that day, a stranger will"
349,"appear in the land, bringing peril to Peladon. "
350,(Peladon sees the Doctor and Jo being brought in by the guards.) 
351,HEPESH: And great tribulation to his kingdom. 
352,(The Doctor stares as the Ice Warriors approach him.) 
353,"IZLYR: Chairman delegate from Earth, greetings. Delegate Izlyr from"
354,Mars. Sub-delegate Ssorg. 
355,"(At a nod from Hepesh, Grun leaves Peladon's side and goes out behind a"
356,tapestry.) 
357,ALPHA: Delegate Alpha Centauri. The Galactic Committee is terribly in
358,need of your experience and judgement. 
359,ARCTURUS: I am delegate Arcturus. You are late. 
360,"DOCTOR: Late? Er, yes, my apologies to the Committee but, er, our space"
361,shuttle crash-landed down the mountain. I wonder if something could be
362,done about rescuing it. 
363,"HEPESH: That will be arranged. I am Hepesh, High Priest of Peladon. "
364,DOCTOR: How do you do? 
365,HEPESH: Protocol demands that you should present formally your
366,credentials to King Peladon. Hand them to me. 
367,DOCTOR: I'm afraid that will not be possible. We have lost everything
368,in the crash. 
369,"PELADON: We can deal with protocol later, Hepesh. Present the chairman"
370,"delegate from Earth, and his companion. "
371,HEPESH: I presume this female is of royal blood? 
372,"DOCTOR: Well, naturally. Why, why do you bother to ask? "
373,HEPESH: We are standing in the royal throne room of Peladon. Only men
374,of rank and females of royal blood may set foot here. The penalty for
375,trespass is death. 
376,"JO: Doctor, I do not deal through intermediaries. Kindly present us to"
377,our royal host. 
378,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Will you excuse me. "
379,(The Doctor kneels before Peladon.) 
380,"DOCTOR: Your Majesty, as delegate from Earth, I greet you. May I"
381,"present Her Royal Highness, the Princess Josephine, of Tardis. "
382,"(Peladon stands. Jo walks forward and curtsies, and Peladon takes her"
383,hand.) 
384,"PELADON: Greetings, Princess. I'm sorry to hear that your journey ended"
385,so uncomfortably. 
386,JO: The whole affair was most deplorable. The pilot was exceedingly
387,inefficient. 
388,"PELADON: Well, I'm glad it was nothing more. You bring a welcome beauty"
389,to a serious occasion. 
390,"JO: Thank you, your Majesty. "
391,IZLYR: Royal Highness. 
392,(The Doctor has to nudge Jo to stop looking into Peladon's eyes and
393,turn to the Ice Lord instead.) 
394,IZLYR: What are your powers on the committee of assessment? 
395,DOCTOR: The Princess is here in the capacity of a royal observer only. 
396,"IZLYR: Ah, as on my planet, you still retain the aristocratic process. "
397,"DOCTOR: Yes, in a democratic sort of way. "
398,"ARCTURUS: Chairman delegate from Earth, we are not here to indulge in"
399,social diplomacy. 
400,"DOCTOR: No, no, of course not, I "
401,ARCTURUS: We are here to consider admitting this somewhat primitive
402,planet into the Galactic Federation. 
403,"DOCTOR: Yes, thank you for reminding me. I "
404,"ALPHA: Unfortunately, the success of our mission in threatened,"
405,violently. 
406,DOCTOR: Threatened? Perhaps you'd be kind enough to explain that to me
407,from the beginning? 
408, [Outside the Throne room] 
409," (Grun is on a ledge above the corridor, working"
410,the end of a long pole under the base of yet another statue of Aggedor.
411,Fragments of the conversation drift down the corridor.) 
412,PELADON : This is an internal affair. We need not trouble the
413,chairman delegate. 
414,"ARCTURUS : By a legend, we are told. "
415,HEPESH : (unintelligible) 
416,ARCTURUS : Or a blatant attempt to intimidate this commission.
417,ALPHA : I cannot 
418,(They all speak at once.) 
419, [Throne room]
420,
421,"DOCTOR: Gentlemen, please! "
422,ARCTURUS: Are of no concern. 
423,DOCTOR: Do my ears deceive me? Members of the Galactic Federation
424,squabbling like a gang of small children? 
425,"HEPESH: You are right, chairman delegate. Moreover, the throne room is"
426,hardly the place for such discussions. 
427,IZLYR: Then perhaps we should withdraw to the delegate's conference
428,room. 
429,DOCTOR: That is a splendid idea. 
430,(The delegates bow to Peladon and start to leave.) 
431,"PELADON: Princess? I do look forward to speaking with you again, less"
432,formally. 
433,JO: Thank you. That would be very nice. See you later. 
434,"(As the delegates walk slowly along the corridor, the Doctor looks up"
435,and sees the statue topple forward.) 
436, Episode Two
437,
438, [Outside the Throne room]
439,
440, DOCTOR: Look out! 
441,(Jo steps back as the Doctor rushes forward to push the other delegates
442,out of the path of the falling statue.) 
443,DOCTOR: Look out!
444,
445, [Throne room]
446,
447," (Peladon runs for the door, but Hepesh stops him.)"
448,
449,PELADON: What has happened? 
450,"HEPESH: Wait, there may be danger. "
451,PELADON: But the delegates may be harmed! 
452,HEPESH: Your Majesty's safety is all that matters.
453,
454, [Outside the Throne room]
455,
456, (Grun sneaks away.) 
457,"JO: Phew, that was a bit close, wasn't it? "
458,"DOCTOR: All you all right, Princess? "
459,"JO: Yes, thank you. I think so. "
460,IZLYR: You have saved our lives. Thank you. 
461,"DOCTOR: I'm sorry to have been so abrupt about it, gentlemen. "
462,ALPHA: This is terrible! We could all have been killed! 
463,JO: Well I feel definitely wobbly at the knees. 
464,(Hepesh enters.) 
465,HEPESH: Aggedor has been merciful. We must give thanks that you have
466,all been spared. 
467,"DOCTOR: I think we should investigate what caused this, Hepesh. "
468,ALPHA: I agree. 
469,"IZLYR: Yes, indeed. "
470,DOCTOR: If only as a matter of protocol. 
471,(Grun is back in the throne room.) 
472,HEPESH: It is a sign of Aggedor's anger. His ghost walks amongst us. 
473,DOCTOR: It must have been a pretty substantial type of ghost to have
474,shifted a solid granite statue. 
475,"ALPHA: Yes, very. "
476,HEPESH: The spirit of Aggedor can move mountains. 
477,JO: It seemed more like he was trying to remove us. 
478,"ALPHA: Our mission is peaceful, We come to help your people, to raise"
479,them from barbarism. 
480,JO: Maybe they don't want to be raised. 
481,"IZLYR: Hepesh, you say this is foretold in your ancient writings. What"
482,sort of manifestation is there supposed to be? 
483,"HEPESH: It is written, his coming shall be full or terror and darkness."
484,"His cry shall be heard in the night, and death shall walk in the land"
485,of Peladon! 
486,"JO: Well, there was no cry of warning, and nobody actually saw him, did"
487,they? 
488,"HEPESH: To the unbeliever, all signs are as dust in the wind. "
489,"DOCTOR: Well, the point is what does King Peladon believe? "
490,"IZLYR: If this man speaks for King Peladon, our purpose here is wasted."
491,
492,ARCTURUS: The conference must be cancelled. 
493,HEPESH: I agree. 
494,"PELADON: No! I am King, not Hepesh! And not Aggedor. Would you rejoin"
495,us? Hepesh.
496,
497, [Throne room]
498,
499, PELADON: Negotiations must continue. 
500,IZLYR: Negotiations are only possible in a peaceful atmosphere. 
501,ARCTURUS: Political conflict violates Federation law. 
502,"PELADON: Centuries ago on your own planets, war and violence"
503,flourished. 
504,(Jo looks towards the tapestry then the Doctor. The Doctor nods.) 
505,ALPHA: We have learned to control our past. 
506,PELADON: Then you must teach Peladon. Without help we will never raise
507,ourselves from the dark ages. Do not desert us now. 
508,(Jo quietly sidles away and goes behind the tapestry.) 
509,"DOCTOR: Your Majesty is an enlightened ruler, but who will your people"
510,believe? King Peladon or Aggedor? 
511,(Jo emerges above the corridor where the remains of the statue are
512,being cleared away. She finds a small metal tool.) 
513,"ARCTURUS: Doctor, you are our chairman. Do we go or stay? "
514,DOCTOR: I think it would be a tragedy if the conference were to break
515,up now. 
516,"IZLYR: If we remain, we put ourselves at risk. "
517,"DOCTOR: His Majesty deserves the opportunity to convince us, surely? "
518,"ALPHA: But if we do decide to leave, are we free to go? "
519,(Jo returns quietly.) 
520,PELADON: Of course. 
521,"DOCTOR: You don't think that King Peladon would keep you here by force,"
522,do you? 
523,ALPHA: Such things have been known on primitive planets. 
524,PELADON: Why should I detain you? 
525,"ARCTURUS: As pawns in some political game, perhaps? "
526,ALPHA: That has happened before. 
527,IZLYR: It would be most unwise. 
528,PELADON: There is no plot! I am being completely honest with you.
529,"Please, stay and help me to help my people. "
530,"DOCTOR: Your Majesty, we will adjourn now and consider our position. We"
531,will let you know our decision as soon as possible. 
532,(The Doctor and the delegates leave. Jo is last in the line.) 
533,"PELADON: Your Highness, would you remain a moment? Hepesh, you may"
534,leave us. 
535,HEPESH: Your Majesty. 
536,"(Hepesh leaves, then the guards.) "
537,PELADON: Do you believe me? 
538,JO: I'm only an observer. It's up to the committee to decide whether or
539,not to help you. 
540,PELADON: I'm talking from a personal point of view. I don't often get
541,the chance. 
542,JO: Being a king is no fun? 
543,PELADON: It's very lonely. But you must know that. It's so hard to find
544,someone to talk to as a person. 
545,"JO: But you have Hepesh. He seems very fond of you, just like a father."
546,
547,"PELADON: Hepesh is an old man, like your friend the Doctor. "
548,JO: I somehow don't think he'd care for that. 
549,PELADON: I was brought up by wise old men. I hardly ever see anyone
550,"young or beautiful. My mother was an Earth woman, so you see, there is"
551,a bond between us. Do you believe me? 
552,(Peladon takes Jo's hand and gazes into her eyes.) 
553,"JO: Yes. Yes, I believe you. "
554,PELADON: Then speak for me to the commission. Make them see my case. 
555,JO: I see. All you want is a political ally. 
556,"PELADON: No, I want you as a friend. "
557,"JO: Oh, no. No. I'm strictly neutral. Count me out!"
558,
559, [Aggedor's Shrine]
560,
561," (Down in the depths of the castle, Hepesh finishes"
562,his obeisance then turns to the kneeling guard.) 
563,"HEPESH: The failure was not yours, Grun. You acted well. Aggedor has"
564,been merciful to his enemies. But now the hour for mercy has passed.
565,Now an evil influence comes between King Peladon and his true destiny.
566,It must be destroyed. Aggedor will give his blessing. I dedicate you to
567,"the destruction of the King's enemy, to purge the soul of Peladon by"
568,"this act and to give the ghost of Aggedor release! There, it is done."
569,"The foremost of the King's enemies is the chairman delegate from Earth,"
570,"the one they call the Doctor. Destroy him, Grun!"
571,
572, [The Doctor's room]
573,
574, (The Doctor examines Jo's find.) 
575,JO: Well? What is it? 
576,DOCTOR: It's an electronic key. Used for opening doors by identifying
577,the bearer electronically. Probably used for their spaceship. 
578,JO: Whose spaceship? 
579,"DOCTOR: Well, the Ice Warriors of course. It's made from trisilicate,"
580,which can only be found on the planet Mars. 
581,JO: So you think that it was Ssorg who made those footprints on the
582,balcony? 
583,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think it's highly likely. "
584,JO: Wasn't he in the throne room with us? 
585,"DOCTOR: I'm not sure. Well, you managed to slip away without anybody"
586,"noticing, remember? "
587,JO: Yes. But what would they be after? 
588,"DOCTOR: Well, the last time that I encountered them, Jo, they were"
589,"trying to colonise the planet Earth, and Peladon is very like Earth. "
590,JO: Hmm. But they say they're here for the same reason as the other
591,delegates. Peace. 
592,"DOCTOR: Do they. Well, believe me, I know the Ice Warriors, Jo. They're"
593,"a savage and a warlike race. No, among the delegates, only Ssorg's"
594,strength could have shifted that statue. 
595,JO: I still think you're jumping to conclusions. 
596,"DOCTOR: Well, who else could be responsible? Arcturus is only a box of"
597,"tricks, and I hardly think Centauri would hurt a fly, would you? "
598,"JO: No, I think he's rather sweet. Or is he a she? "
599,DOCTOR: Neither. She is an it. It's a hermaphrodite hexapod. 
600,JO: Oh. 
601,"DOCTOR: The point is, what possible motive could they have? "
602,"JO: Look, why don't we just organise someone to dig out the Tardis and"
603,get out here? Did you have to get us involved in all this? 
604,"DOCTOR: I didn't really have any choice, did I. "
605,"JO: Oh, come on. You love all that chairman delegate stuff. Admit it. "
606,"DOCTOR: Well, how do you like being a princess, Princess? "
607,"JO: Like you said, I didn't really have much choice. "
608,(An electronic wailing noise starts up.) 
609,JO: What's that? 
610,DOCTOR: It sounds like an alarm. Come on.
611,
612, [Delegate's conference room]
613,
614,(Jo and the Doctor run along the corridor to
615,discover Arcturus with a panel in his life support box open.) 
616,JO: What are you going to do? 
617,"DOCTOR: Well, someone's taken the servo-junction unit of his life"
618,support system. I'll have to re-wire the circuits. 
619,"JO: Well, what does this servo thing look like? "
620,DOCTOR: It's a small plastic cube full of very fine circuitry. Why? 
621,"JO: Well, whoever took it must have been the one who tried to kill"
622,Arcturus. 
623,DOCTOR: Obviously. So? 
624,"JO: So if we could find it. Look, I can search all the delegates rooms."
625,
626,"DOCTOR: You'll do no such thing, Jo. It's far too dangerous. I'm going"
627,to try a little direct confrontation here. 
628,JO: But if we had some real evidence. 
629,"DOCTOR: Jo, please do as I say, there's a good girl. "
630,"(Izlyr enters, followed by Hepesh.) "
631,IZLYR: What are you doing to Arcturus? 
632,DOCTOR: Someone has disconnected a vital part of his life support
633,"system. I'm trying to save him. Now, please, leave me alone. "
634,(Alpha enters and Jo leaves.) 
635,DOCTOR: I think that should do it. 
636,(The alarm winds down.) 
637,IZLYR: Have you succeeded? 
638,"DOCTOR: Yes, he'll be all right in a moment. "
639,HEPESH: This is the work of Aggedor. 
640,"DOCTOR: This is the work of a skilled, technical knowledge. Your"
641,"medieval monster, Hepesh, would simply have tried to smash Arcturus'"
642,protective globe. 
643,IZLYR: What are you suggesting? I reject the accusation. 
644,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course, you would. But nevertheless, you can't deny"
645,that you do have the necessary technical knowledge. 
646,IZLYR: The technology of Centauri is competent enough. And so is that
647,"of Earth. And it was you, Doctor, that we discovered."

650,
651," (Jo enters and goes over to a large, ornate metal"
652,chest and looks inside. Then she checks various items on a table before
653,opening a wooden chest and finding what she is looking for. She is
654,"about to leave with it when she hears heavy breathing, and hides behind"
655,a tapestry of course. Ssorg enters. He sees the open metal chest and
656,then Jo's pink shoes sticking out beneath the tapestry. He pulls it
657,aside.) 
658,SSORG: Why are you here? 
659,JO: I was looking for something and I found it. 
660,SSORG: This is not ours. 
661,(Ssorg takes the component.) 
662,"JO: No, you took it from poor Arcturus when you tried to kill him. "
663,SSORG: You will stay. I must inform Izlyr. 
664,(Ssorg takes a weapon from the metal chest and leaves.)
665,
666, [Delegate's conference room]
667,
668, ARCTURUS: I have been attacked. 
669,"ALPHA: By whom, Arcturus? By whom? "
670,HEPESH: Was the face of Aggedor revealed to you? 
671,ARCTURUS: Memory circuits out of phase. 
672,ALPHA: It must have been a dreadful experience! We have to ask him
673,later. 
674,IZLYR: We cannot wait. It is too important. We must know now. 
675,ARCTURUS: I cannot remember. 
676,"DOCTOR: How very fortunate, Izlyr. Excuse me, gentlemen."
677,
678, [Corridor] 
679, (The Doctor turns a corner and is stopped by
680,Grun.) 
681,"DOCTOR: Let me past, Grun. "
682,(Grun takes the Doctor's arm and gestures.) 
683,"DOCTOR: What do you want? You want me to come with you? All right, all"
684,"right, I'm coming. Where are you taking me? "
685,(Grun leads the Doctor back past the conference room. Hepesh watches
686,them go.)
687,
688, [Delegate's conference room]
689,
690," ARCTURUS: I saw no one, delegate Izlyr. The attack"
691,was too quick. 
692,IZLYR: We discovered the Doctor. He seemed to be attacking your life
693,support mechanism. 
694,ALPHA: But what motive could the Doctor have? 
695,IZLYR: Ask his masters on Earth. 
696,"ARCTURUS: The Princess, why is she here? "
697,"ALPHA: A diplomatic courtesy, surely? Peladon's mother was an Earth"
698,woman. 
699,IZLYR: Exactly. And if Peladon marries this Earth princess the blood
700,relationship will be strengthened and could be used to foster Earth's
701,interests inside the Federation. 
702,ARCTURUS: That must not be allowed to happen. 
703,"(Ssorg enters, without the weapon.) "
704,SSORG: Lord Izlyr? 
705,"IZLYR: Yes, what is it? "
706,SSORG: I must speak with you. 
707,"IZLYR: Of course. If you will excuse us, Arcturus. "
708,ARCTURUS: There has been some new development? 
709,"ALPHA: Something dreadful, no doubt. Really, this barbarous planet. "
710,IZLYR: Sub-delegate Ssorg has discovered the missing servo-junction
711,unit. 
712,ARCTURUS: Where? 
713,IZLYR: In the hands of the Earth Princess. 
714,(Who is using a table and a box to climb up to an opening in the thick
715,castle wall and out on to a narrow ledge. There she makes her perilous
716,way to the next opening. That leads to a corridor which fortunately has
717,"a table she can step down onto, then run off.)"

724,"Princess? All right, all right! "
725,"(Grun pulls the Doctor through the doorway. Elsewhere, Jo can't decide"
726,which corridor to take. Then there is a roar and she looks up at a
727,living version of the statue of Aggedor. She flees back the way she
728,came.)

743,"JO: The monster, Aggedor. He's down there! "
744,IZLYR: Ssorg. 
745,(Ssorg moves off with his weapon.) 
746,"JO: No, you can't! Look, it'll kill Ssorg. "
747,IZLYR: Ssorg's sonic gun can destroy any living creature. 
748,(Grun comes out from behind a tapestry and leaves just before Ssorg
749,arrives.) 
750,IZLYR: Where were you going? 
751,"JO: I was going to find the Doctor and King Peladon, when I saw "
752,SSORG: There is nothing. 
753,JO: But it was there. I saw him. 
754,IZLYR: You say you see this monster when there is no monster. You are
755,trying to trick us. 
756,"JO: No! Oh, look, please, I've got to find the Doctor. "
757,IZLYR: Then we will help you. It is time that you and the Doctor
758,answered my questions.

764,
765," IZLYR: Sit down, Princess. Why did you try to"
766,escape? 
767,JO: I was frightened. Can you blame me? 
768,"IZLYR: So, Princess, you believe that we tried to kill Arcturus. "
769,"JO: Well if you didn't, why was the missing servo-unit in your room? "
770,IZLYR: Perhaps you brought it here as part of your scheme to trap us. 
771,JO: But that's just not true! I. One of you must have tried to kill
772,Arcturus. 
773,IZLYR: Nobody tried to kill him. 
774,JO: What? 
775,"IZLYR: To destroy Arcturus, the helium regenerator must be deactivated."
776,
777,JO: What about the unit? 
778,IZLYR: Merely sensor equipment. Disconnecting that only produces
779,metabolic coma. 
780,JO: So it couldn't be fatal? 
781,IZLYR: Only uncomfortable. 
782,"JO: I'm sorry if I might have misjudged you, but the Doctor did say you"
783,were a race of warriors. 
784,"IZLYR: We were once, but now we reject violence except in self-defence."
785,
786,JO: What about Ssorg's gun? This is supposed to be a peaceful mission. 
787,"IZLYR: Unfortunately, in order to preserve peace, it is necessary to"
788,survive. 
789,"JO: Well, if you didn't do it, who did? Who could benefit by it? "
790,IZLYR: Perhaps the Doctor will be able to explain.

806,
807,(All the delegates and Jo are gathered.) 
808,"HEPESH: Your Majesty, the charge against the chairman delegate from"
809,"Earth is one of extreme sacrilege. I, Hepesh, High Priest of Peladon,"
810,"and Grun, the King's champion, accuse you, an alien intruder, of"
811,"desecrating the holy of holies, the inner sanctum of the temple of"
812,Aggedor. Your Majesty. 
813,"PELADON: I have no alternative, Doctor. To this charge, the laws of"

820,HEPESH: Only the alien's death can purify the holy temple of Aggedor. 
821,DOCTOR: I had no idea that the tunnels would lead there. 
822,PELADON: Tunnels? I know of no tunnels. Hepesh? 
823,DOCTOR: Surely your Majesty must know that beneath the citadel there is
824,a network of secret passages. 
825,"HEPESH: He is lying, your Majesty. There are no such passages. "

830,IZLYR: His ignorance of the law at least deserves consideration. 
831,"HEPESH: No, his crime is too great. "
832,IZLYR: A Royal pardon would count highly with the Federation. 
833,HEPESH: The Federation cannot override our holy laws. It is forbidden
834,by its charter. 
835,"ARCTURUS: That is correct. Galactic Articles of Peace, paragraph twenty"
836,"nine, subsection two. "
837,ALPHA: Then we are powerless to interfere. 
838,JO: But you can't just let him be killed! 
839,HEPESH: You cannot prevent it. 
840,"JO: No, but a King can. You asked me once if I believed in you. I want"
841,"to believe in you, and here is your opportunity to show that you are a"
842,civilised King. 
843,HEPESH: He can do nothing. This is ancient law. 
844,PELADON: Hepesh is right. I am powerless to save him. 
845,JO: I'm begging you! Please. 
846,PELADON: There is one alternative. Trial by combat. 
847,HEPESH: But the Earth delegate is not of noble blood! 
848,JO: That's barbaric! 
849,PELADON: It is all I can offer. 
850,HEPESH: He cannot be given an honourable alternative. 
851,"PELADON: You forget, Hepesh, he is a man of rank, and as such, an"
852,"honourary nobleman of the citadel. What do you say, Doctor? "
853,"DOCTOR: Very well, your Majesty, I accept the challenge. But who do I"
854,fight? 
855,PELADON: You will be held captive in your room until dawn. Then you
856,"will lowered into the pit beneath the citadel, where you will engage in"
857,"combat to the death with the King's Champion, Grun."

859, [Outside the Doctor's room] 
860," DOCTOR: Yes, you're a wily old bird, aren't old"

867,"PELADON: I'm sorry, but there are some things I cannot change, even for"
868,you. 
869,JO: Did you even want to? What do mercy and compassion mean to you? You
870,need someone to die to justify your own stupid superstition! 
871,PELADON: I want no one to die! Can't you see? I've done all I can. He
872,means a great deal to you. 
873,JO: Yes. 
874,"PELADON: Princess, I'm helpless. Don't hate me for that. "
875,JO: I don't hate you. 
876,PELADON: Both Torbis and my father died before they could break the
877,traditions that bind us. But my mother taught me all she could of
878,"justice, compassion and love. She knew the time would come. "
879,JO: Then make it now! Be the King she wanted you to be. Be the King I
880,want you to be. 
881,"PELADON: Oh, there's so much I could do if I had someone by my side to"
882,"help me. Oh, Princess, will you not give your Royal agreement to an"
883,interplanetary alliance by marriage with me? 
884,"JO: You know, I just don't understand you. I really don't. One minute"
885,"you're condemning the Doctor to death, and the next minute you're"
886,proposing to me. 
887,"PELADON: Josephine, the matters are completely separate. I had to"
888,condemn the Doctor. That was my duty as a King. What I'm trying to say
889,"to you now, that comes from my feelings as a man. "
890,JO: Then there's no connection between the two? 
891,PELADON: But of course not. How could there be!

904," ARCTURUS: The facts point to one thing, a"
905,unilateral blood alliance between Peladon and Earth. 
906,IZLYR: It is unusual to celebrate such an event with an execution. 
907,ARCTURUS: That possibility is obviously intended to confuse us. 
908,ALPHA: I do not understand! What is happening? 
909,ARCTURUS: This is a conspiracy to destroy Federation unity and we are
910,to be the victims.

918,HEPESH: A large blue box was found on the lower slope of the mountain. 
919,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's it. Where is it now? "
920,HEPESH: It is being brought to the citadel. 
921,"DOCTOR: Well, that's splendid. And what about Princess Josephine? "
922,HEPESH: She will be allowed to leave with you. 
923,"DOCTOR: Hepesh, why do you go to so much trouble? You could simply have"
924,me killed. 
925,HEPESH: I do not mean to have this planet destroyed in retaliation by
926,the spaceships of the Federation. 
927,DOCTOR: Yet you slap the Federation in the face by sabotaging the
928,commission. Why? 
929,HEPESH: Because I'm afraid. 
930,DOCTOR: Afraid? Afraid of what? The Federation is your safeguard. 
931,HEPESH: That is not true! I know the Federation's real intent. 
932,DOCTOR: The Federation's real intent is to help you. 
933,"HEPESH: No! They'll exploit us for our minerals, enslave us with their"
934,"machines, corrupt us with their technology. The face of Peladon will be"
935,"changed, the past swept away, and everything that I know and value will"
936,have gone. 
937,"DOCTOR: The progress that they offer, that we offer, isn't like that. "
938,HEPESH: I would rather be a cave dweller and free. 
939,DOCTOR: Free? With your people imprisoned by ritual and superstition? 
940,HEPESH: We need Aggedor. 
941,DOCTOR: You can hardly expect your pet ghost to take on the whole
942,"Federation single-handed, can you? "

952,ALPHA: What will the Grand Council say? 
953,JO: That you have no power to cancel a mission just like that. 
954,IZLYR: The Princess is right. Federation authorisation would be
955,required. 
956,"ARCTURUS: If we stay, we risk being taken as hostages. "
957,ALPHA: We must leave while we have the chance. We're in terrible
958,danger!

960,ARCTURUS: This is a very delicate political situation. 
961,JO: It'll be even more delicate if the Doctor is killed. 
962,IZLYR: Yes. That will amount to a declaration of war. 
963,ARCTURUS: An interesting problem. 
964,IZLYR: And the Federation would totally destroy Peladon. 
965,ALPHA: Yes it would.

986,you lot had ganged up to leave the Doctor stranded. 
987,"IZLYR: We have not, as you say, ganged up. Arcturus is a coward by"
988,"logic and Centauri is a coward by instinct, but they will not leave the"
989,Doctor stranded. 
990,JO: And why the sudden change? 
991,IZLYR: Because Federation law allows only unanimous decisions and I
992,voted to stay. 
993,JO: You? Why would you do that? 
994,IZLYR: You remember when the statue fell? The Doctor saved my life. Now

1095,HEPESH: Guard! 
1096,PELADON: Wait! 
1097,DOCTOR: Your Majesty. I bring you a message. From Aggedor. 
1098,HEPESH: He commits ever greater sacrilege! No one sees Aggedor and
1099,lives. 
1100,"DOCTOR: Well we just did. And I must say, he's quite pleasant company,"
1101,for an animal. He didn't even seem to mind when I scratched him behind
1102,the ears. 
1103,HEPESH: He defiles everything that is sacred. He must be silenced. 
1104,IZLYR: Let us hear what he has to say. 
1105,HEPESH: No! 
1106,"PELADON: We shall hear him, Hepesh. Doctor? "
1107,"DOCTOR: Aggedor is no spirit, your Majesty, but a truly noble beast."
1108,"But his power is being used falsely, however, to prevent any chance"
1109,that you may have of entering the Galactic Federation. 
1110,HEPESH: You lie! The spirit of Aggedor will take his revenge! His
1111,manifestation is holy! 
1112,"DOCTOR: Rubbish! His manifestation, as you call it, is solid, hairy,"
1113,fact. 
1114,JO: It's true. It's no ghost. I've seen it as well. 
1115,"HEPESH: Then produce this creature, if you can. "
1116,"DOCTOR: He lives in the tunnels beneath the city, sire. "
1117,"PELADON: Tunnels. You spoke of them before, Doctor, yet I know nothing"
1118,of them. 
1119,"HEPESH: There are no tunnels, your Majesty. "
1120,"DOCTOR: The entrance is hidden, your Majesty. "
1121,IZLYR: Then we must organise a search. 
1122,HEPESH: No! This is merely a device to postpone the trial by combat. 
1123,"DOCTOR: Once I have proved what Aggedor really is, the trial by combat,"
1124,"sir, will hardly become necessary. "
1125,HEPESH: So you want us to spend a lifetime searching for these mythical
1126,tunnels. A coward's devious excuse. Take him to the pit. 
1127,JO: No!

1137,has a sandy bottom and climbing nets on all sides. The combatants pick
1138,"up pikes and bow to the King, who acknowledges them and sits. The ropes"
1139,"are raised and Grun attacks. They trade swings, then the Doctor falls"
1140,"back onto a log. Grun swings his pike, the Doctor dodges and the metal"
1141,"pike head is firmly stuck in the wood. Technically, the Doctor has Grun"
1142,"at his mercy, but Hepesh drops the Captain's sword down to him.) "
1143,HEPESH: Grun! 
1144,"(Grun manages to cut the top of the Doctor's pike, then chops the"
1145,remaining wood in half leaving him defenceless. The Doctor dodges
1146,Grun's thrusts then moves inside and grabs the man's arm. He beats his
1147,hand against the log forcing him to drop the sword. They then throw
1148,"each other a few times, and the Doctor gets his foot caught in the rope"
1149,"net. Grun picks up the log, the Doctor untangles himself, and the two"
1150,"circle warily. Finally the Doctor grabs Grun, pushes him head first"
1151,into the net and starts to strangle him.)

1167,PELADON: But what about the attack on Arcturus? 
1168,"DOCTOR: Faked, your Majesty. He told Hepesh what to do. "
1169,IZLYR: That is what I suspected. 
1170,JO: And the things I found on the balcony and in Izlyr's room? 
1171,"DOCTOR: Planted by Hepesh, or one of his agents. "
1172,PELADON: And the manifestation of Aggedor? 
1173,"DOCTOR: Well, that's simple, your Majesty. Hepesh found that on a high"
1174,"mountain a few still existed. So he captured one, trained it and kept"
1175,"it hidden in the tunnels beneath the citadel, ready to pop out whenever"
1176,he needed a bit of haunting. 
1177,PELADON: But why did he do all this? What did he hope to gain? 
1178,"DOCTOR: The entire planet of Peladon, or effective control of it, which"
1179,comes to the same thing. 
1180,PELADON: And Arcturus? 
1181,IZLYR: His planet lacks mineral deposits. Peladon has them in
1182,abundance. 
1183,DOCTOR: That's why he wanted to make sure that Peladon did not enter
1184,"the Galactic Federation. You see, he'd already made a private secret"
1185,alliance with Hepesh. 
1186,"ALPHA: Extremely unethical! Fortunately the scheme has been foiled, so"
1187,all is well. 
1188,"DOCTOR: Ah, but is it? "
1189,JO: Yes. Arcturus is dead. 
1190,DOCTOR: But Hepesh is still very much alive. 
1191,(And making his way through the tunnels.) 
1192,"DOCTOR: You see, Hepesh believed everything that Arcturus told him. He"
1193,still does. He firmly believes that entering the Galactic Federation
1194,would mean slavery and he'd go to any lengths to stop you joining. 
1195,JO: But what can he do? 
1196,DOCTOR: Accuse the Ice Warriors of murdering Arcturus. 
1197,"IZLYR: Yes, Mars and the world of Arcturus are old enemies. That would"
1198,mean war. 
1199,DOCTOR: Exactly. And then all the rest of the Galactic Federation would
1200,take sides and 
1201,ALPHA: The Federation will be ripped! There will be interplanetary
1202,conflict! 
1203,DOCTOR: And Peladon would become the first battlefield. Blasted and
1204,sterile.

1218,(Grun nods to the Doctor to leave the room.) 
1219,"DOCTOR: Well, sire? "
1220,PELADON: There could be civil war. Will the Federation back me? 
1221,ALPHA: The Galactic Charter does not permit our involvement in internal
1222,politics.

1224,"JO: The circumstances are unusual, you know, and your own safety is"

1247,"become? Hepesh could still bring Peladon to his way of thinking, and if"
1248,"that happens, he'll have won without a fight. "
1249,JO: But he can't just accuse the Ice Warriors of murder. There were
1250,witnesses. Ssorg had to shoot him to save your life. 
1251,"DOCTOR: Jo, you seem to be forgetting something else. Officially we"
1252,don't even exist. We're just a couple of imposters. 
1253,(They arrive at the entrance to the tunnels.)

1257,"DOCTOR: Yeah, so that's why Grun was beckoning at me like that. "
1258,JO: Hmm?

1332," JO: Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but a"
1333,"marriage has not been arranged. To coin a phrase, we're just good"
1334,friends. 
1335,ALPHA: But it would have made a magnificent coronation. 
1336,"JO: Before we have a coronation, we have to have a king. Are you going"
1337,to help me or not? 
1338,ALPHA: Well 
1339,(Ssorg enters.) 
1340,"SSORG: Lord Izlyr, the link with our spaceship has been deliberately"
1341,destroyed. 
1342,ALPHA: Yours too? 
1343,"IZLYR: Then we must make use of yours, Princess. "
1344,"JO: Well, don't look at me. Ours was damaged when we crash-landed. "
1345,ALPHA: We're completely cut off? 
1346,JO: Hepesh? 
1347,"IZLYR: Yes, Hepesh."

1351, (Two of Hepesh's men take position on the ledge.
1352,Hepesh sends the Captain to deal with the sentries outside the door.) 
1353,"CAPTAIN: Men, fall in. "
1354,"(The guards obey, and the two on the ledge jump them and knock them"
1355,out.) 
1356,"HEPESH: Remember, Captain, no harm must befall the king. Proceed."

1359,
1360,(Alpha is having an hysterical monologue at Ssorg
1361,while Jo and Izlyr have a discussion.) 
1362,ALPHA: What will happen? What will we do? 
1363,"JO: Yes, but I'm sure the Doctor would know what to do. "
1364,"ALPHA: I'm a civil servant, not a scientist! "
1365,"IZLYR: Yes, but where is he? "
1366,ALPHA: There's no escape! 
1367,"JO: Well, I don't know. "
1368,"ALPHA: Without our communicators, we cannot return to our spacecraft! I"
1369,knew something like this would happen! 
1370,"IZLYR: Arcturus was an unattractive person, Princess "
1371,ALPHA: We're all going to be killed! How are we to escape from this
1372,barbarous planet? 
1373,IZLYR: But I think I preferred his cold logic 
1374,ALPHA: We should never have come here at all! It was madness! 
1375,IZLYR: To the hysteria of Centauri. 
1376,ALPHA: I thought so all the time! Now there's no escape! 
1377,"JO: Oh, Centauri, stop it. "
1378,ALPHA: We shall all be killed! 
1379,IZLYR: Centauri. 
1380,"ALPHA: I tell you, we will be killed! What are we going to do? "
1381,"JO: Centauri, stop it! Nothing has happened yet. We're quite safe here."
1382,
1383,IZLYR: They would not dare to attack Federation delegates.

1388," (With a yell, the Captain and his guards rush in."
1389,The Captain holds Peladon at sword point while the two lots of guards
1390,"duel each other. After several deaths, presumably his own men.) "
1391,"CAPTAIN: Surrender, or the King will die! "
1392,(The King's guard gives in. Hepesh enters.) 
1393,PELADON: Hepesh. I thought you would bring me the crown of kingship.
1394,Are you going to bring me death instead? 
1395,"HEPESH: You have become a stranger to me, Peladon. Return to the"
1396,"ancient ways of our people, and you will live on, our beloved king. If"
1397,"not, the royal line of Peladon must meet an ignoble end."

1401,(Aggedor roars up ahead.) 
1402,"DOCTOR: Grun, you're a brave warrior. What you're going to see now may"
1403,"amaze you, but just you trust me. "
1404,"(Aggedor approaches, the Doctor gets his modified screwdriver out and"
1405,sets the mirror spinning.) 
1406,"DOCTOR: All right, old chap. You remember me, don't you? You remember"

1413,back and Ssorg readies his weapon.) 
1414,IZLYR: Enter. 
1415,(Hepesh enters.) 
1416,IZLYR: Ssorg will destroy you if you try to harm us. 
1417,HEPESH: I am unarmed and alone. Where is the Doctor? 
1418,JO: I don't know. 
1419,HEPESH: He will not escape capture for long. 
1420,IZLYR: What do you want? 
1421,HEPESH: You will all accompany me to the throne room. 
1422,JO: Why? 
1423,HEPESH: My men hold King Peladon prisoner. If I do not return will all
1424,"of you immediately, he will die. Follow me."

1429,"DOCTOR: Haroon, haroon, haroon. Haroon, harun, haroon. Haroon, harun,"
1430,"haroon. Haroon, harun, haroon. Haroon, harun, haroon. There you are,"
1431,"Grun. Yes, he's quite under now. Not such a terrifying creature after"
1432,"all, is he? Right, I think it's about time that King Peladon learned"
1433,"the truth, don't you? Come on, Aggedor. Come on, old chap, that's it."
1434,"Come on, Aggedor. That's it. Come on, Grun. "
1435,"(The Doctor leads Aggedor by the horn, while Grun nervously follows"
1436,behind.)

1441,
1442,HEPESH: You see? I did not lie. 
1443,JO: What are you going to do to him? 
1444,HEPESH: Nothing if the delegates cooperate. 
1445,IZLYR: You will answer to Federation justice for this. 
1446,HEPESH: The Federation has no jurisdiction over me or over this planet.
1447,It is you who will answer for your interference. 
1448,ALPHA: You are holding us here by force! You will answer for that! 
1449,HEPESH: I am not holding you. I do not want you either as guests or as
1450,hostages. I know the retribution this planet would suffer if anything
1451,happened to any of you. Therefore go in peace. Tell your masters
1452,"Peladon wants nothing of their Federation, but go now! "
1453,DOCTOR: Who dares challenge Peladon! 
1454,(The Doctor holds the doors half closed behind him.) 
1455,JO: Doctor! 
1456,DOCTOR: Kneel and pay homage to his sacred guardian! 
1457,"(The Doctor flings open the doors and Aggedor shuffles in, escorted by"
1458,Grun.) 
1459,DOCTOR: Kneel! 
1460,PELADON: Hepesh! He is real! 
1461,ALPHA: The beast! 
1462,HEPESH: Do not listen to the alien! I am your High Priest! 
1463,"DOCTOR: And I speak for Aggedor. And I accuse you, Hepesh, of being not"
1464,"only a traitor to your king, but also to your sacred trust. "
1465,HEPESH: Do not listen to the alien! This is not Aggedor's spirit! I
1466,will show you the reality of this creature! 
1467,(Hepesh takes a torch from its sconce.) 
1468,HEPESH: I am his master! When I speak he obeys! 
1469,(A soldier pulls the Doctor back as Hepesh waves the torch in Aggedor's
1470,face.) 
1471,HEPESH: Aggedor! Aggedor! Kill him! 
1472,"(Aggedor looks at the Doctor, then knocks the torch from Hepesh's hand"
1473,and attacks him. The Doctor intervenes with the screwdriver and backs
1474,Aggedor out of the room.) 
1475,"DOCTOR: Back! Back, that's it. Back, back. "
1476,PELADON: Hepesh! 
1477,(Peladon takes the injured Hepesh in his arms.) 
1478,HEPESH: I wanted to save our world. To preserve the old ways. Perhaps I
1479,"was wrong, Peladon. I hope so. The future you set so much store by is"
1480,yours now. 
1481,(Hepesh dies. Jo puts her arms around Peladon.) 
1482,"JO: Peladon, they're waiting for you. "
1483,(Peladon covers Hepesh's face. The Doctor enters. Jo shakes her head.) 
1484,DOCTOR: Tell your men to lay down their arms. Your leader is dead. 
1485,CAPTAIN: Your Majesty. 
1486,(The Captain kneels and offers his sword with its point at his heart.
1487,Peladon takes it.) 
1488,PELADON: There will be no punishments. The memory of this unhappy day
1489,shall be wiped from our history. 
1490,CAPTAIN: Your Majesty.
1491,
1492, [Corridor]
1493,
1494," DOCTOR: Come on, Jo. Follow me. I've got a nice"
1495,surprise for you. 
1496,JO: What? 
1497,DOCTOR: You wait and see. You ready? 
1498,JO: Yes. 
1499,DOCTOR: All right then.
1500,
1501, [Delegate's conference room]
1502,
1503," DOCTOR: Right, take a look at this. "
1504,JO: The Tardis! Wow! 
1505,DOCTOR: Some of Peladon's stout lads heaved here up the mountainside
1506,for us. 
1507,JO: Is she all right? 
1508,"DOCTOR: Yes, never better. I told you the Tardis was indestructible. "
1509,"JO: Well, I hope it gets us back to Earth this time. "
1510,"DOCTOR: So do I, Jo. So do I. "
1511,JO: Is there any doubt? 
1512,DOCTOR: You don't really think that our appearance on the planet of
1513,"Peladon at this precise crisis in their history was just coincidence,"
1514,do you? 
1515,JO: Time Lords again. 
1516,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. "
1517,"JO: Ah, you didn't beat them after all. "
1518,"DOCTOR: No, not yet, but I will, Jo. Just give me time. Still, now"
1519,"we've done what they wanted us to do, I suppose they'll whip us"
1520,straight back to Earth. 
1521,"JO: At least we get to see a real coronation before we go, eh? "
1522,"DOCTOR: Yeah, that's true. You know, I haven't seen a coronation since"
1523,Elizabeth the first's. Or was it Queen Victoria? 
1524,JO: Name dropper. 
1525,(Aggedor enters.) 
1526,JO: Oh! 
1527,DOCTOR: Don't worry. It's only Aggedor. 
1528,JO: Phew! 
1529,DOCTOR: The trouble is he seems to have grown rather fond of me. He
1530,"keeps following me about. Hello, Aggedor. "
1531,JO: Hello. 
1532,"DOCTOR: There's a good chap. All right, down, Aggedor. Down boy, down!"
1533,I think I'd better go and lock him up. 
1534,"JO: Yes, please. "
1535,"DOCTOR: Come on. Come on, Aggedor. "
1536,(Peladon enters as the Doctor and Aggedor leave.) 
1537,"DOCTOR: Your Majesty. Easy, Aggedor. That's it. Come on, this way. "
1538,JO: Hello. Oughtn't you to be getting ready for the big occasion? 
1539,"PELADON: I wanted to see you first, to ask you to stay. "
1540,JO: But I can't. 
1541,PELADON: Why can't you? 
1542,JO: Don't ask me for reasons. You wouldn't believe them. 
1543,PELADON: I need you. 
1544,JO: But you don't understand. I'm not even a real Princess. 
1545,PELADON: That doesn't matter. 
1546,"JO: Oh, Peladon, I'm very, very fond of you, but I can't stay. Really. "
1547,"PELADON: Well look, I must go now. I'll talk to you again after the"
1548,"coronation. I shan't give up, you know? I shall go on asking. "
1549,(Jo kisses Peladon. The Doctor enters.) 
1550,"DOCTOR: Your Majesty. Oh, excuse me sire, but your court officials are"
1551,in a state of considerable panic. 
1552,"PELADON: Oh, yes, of course. I must go. Your Highness? "
1553,JO: Goodbye. 
1554,PELADON: Doctor. 
1555,(Peladon leaves.) 
1556,"DOCTOR: Right, we'll just see the ceremony and slip quietly away, all"
1557,right? 
1558,JO: Yes. Fine. 
1559,DOCTOR: Jo? You do want to come back? 
1560,"JO: I think I'd better, don't you? "
1561,"DOCTOR: Mmm hmm. In any case, I wouldn't like to lose you. Shall we"
1562,join the procession? 
1563,JO: Yes!

1568,and Alpha.) 
1569,"AMAZONIA: I'm telling you, my good fellow, I am the official Earth"
1570,delegate! 
1571,ALPHA: But the Doctor is the accredited Earth delegate. 
1572,AMAZONIA: Doctor? What Doctor? Doctor who? 
1573,(The Doctor and Jo go back around the corner.) 
1574,IZLYR : The Doctor and the Princess Josephine. 
1575,DOCTOR: Pity about that. I rather wanted to see that coronation. 
1576,JO: Never mind. We could always go to Queen Victoria's. 
1577,IZLYR : Yes. 
1578,ALPHA : You must have heard of Princess Josephine! 
1579,DOCTOR: Queen Victoria's? I've already seen Queen Victoria's. JO: I
1580,haven't. Let's go again. 
1581,AMAZONIA : They're obviously imposters! 
1582,DOCTOR: All right. 
1583,ALPHA : I do not understand. 
1584,AMAZONIA: Where are they now? 
1585,"IZLYR: I think they were in the delegate's conference room. Come, I"
1586,will take you there.
