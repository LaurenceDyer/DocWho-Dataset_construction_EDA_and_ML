21,"(The Doctor and Martha run into the Tardis, closely"
22,followed by a blast from an energy weapon.) 
23,DOCTOR: Get down! 
24,(Bang! The Doctor slams the door shut.) 
25,DOCTOR: Did they see you? 
26,MARTHA: I don't know. 
27,DOCTOR: But did they see you? 
28,MARTHA: I don't know. I was too busy running. 
29,"DOCTOR: Martha, it's important. Did they see your face? "
30,"MARTHA: No, they couldn't have. "
31,DOCTOR: Off we go! 
32,(He sets the Tardis in motion.) 
33,DOCTOR: Argh! They're following us. 
34,MARTHA: How can they do that? You've got a time machine. 
35,DOCTOR: Stolen technology. They've got a Time Agent's vortex
36,"manipulator. They can follow us wherever we go, right across the"
37,"universe. They're never going to stop, unless. I'll have to do it."
38,"Martha, you trust me, don't you? "
39,MARTHA: Of course I do. 
40,DOCTOR: Because it all depends on you. 
41,MARTHA: What does? What am I supposed to do? 
42,(He holds out an ornately decorated pocket watch.) 
43,"DOCTOR: Take this watch, because my life depends on it. This watch,"
44,Martha. The watch is 
45,[Doctor's room]
46,
47,(The Doctor is lying on a bed in an old-fashioned
48,wood panelled room. A clock is ticking. There are voices in the
49,"corridor outside. He gets up, and there is a knock on the door.) "
50,DOCTOR: Come in. 
51,"(Martha enters, carrying a breakfast tray and wearing maid's uniform"
52,complete with little cap. She turns her back when she sees he isn't
53,fully dressed.) 
54,"MARTHA: Pardon me, Mister Smith. You're not dressed yet. I can come"
55,back later. 
56,(He puts on a dressing gown.) 
57,"DOCTOR: No, it's all right, it's all right. Put it down. I was er."
58,"Sorry, sorry. Sometimes I have these extraordinary dreams. "
59,(Martha puts the tray down on a table by the leather settee and draws
60,the curtains.) 
61,"MARTHA: What about, sir? "
62,"DOCTOR: I dream I'm this adventurer. This daredevil, a madman. The"
63,"Doctor, I'm called. And last night I dreamt that you were there, as my"
64,companion. 
65,"MARTHA: A teacher and a housemaid, sir? That's impossible. "
66,"DOCTOR: I'm a man from another world, though. "
67,MARTHA: Well it can't be true because there's no such thing. 
68,DOCTOR: This thing. The watch is 
69,(He picks up the ornate pocket watch from the mantlepiece for a moment
70,then puts it back.) 
71,"DOCTOR: Ah, it's funny how dreams slip away. But I do remember one"
72,thing; it all took place in the future. In the Year of Our Lord two
73,thousand and seven. 
74,"MARTHA: I can prove that wrong for you, sir. Here's the morning paper."
75,"It's Monday, November tenth, nineteen thirteen, and you're completely"
76,"human, sir. As human as they come. "
77,"DOCTOR: Mmm, that's me. Completely human."

79,[Farringham School]
80,
81,(The boys are singing 'To Be A Pilgrim' at morning
82,"assembly, and the Union Flag is raised on the flagpole outside the"
83,"magnificent Gothic Revival building. Wearing gown and mortar board, the"
84,Doctor enters the main building.) 
85,"BOY 1: Morning, sir. "
86,"BOY: Morning, sir. "
87,(He passes the other teachers.) 
88,DOCTOR: Headmaster.
89,
90,[Classroom]
91,
92,(The Doctor is holding a cane and reading from a
93,"text book on the Battle of Waterloo, 18th June 1815.) "
94,"DOCTOR: Advanced with little impediment. The French were all but spent,"
95,with only two battalions of the old guard remaining. A final reserve
96,"force was charged with protecting Napoleon, but by evening, the advance"
97,of the Allied troops had forced them to retreat.

100,
101,"(After class, he walks along a tiled corridor which"
102,"the two housemaids, Martha and Jenny are scrubbing on their hands and"
103,knee.) 
104,"MARTHA: Morning, sir. "
105,"DOCTOR: Yes, hi. "
106,(The Doctor goes up the stairs.) 
107,"JENNY: Head in the clouds, that one. Don't know why you're so sweet on"
108,him. 
109,"MARTHA: He's just kind to me, that's all. Not everyone's that"
110,"considerate, what with me being "
111,JENNY: A Londoner? 
112,MARTHA: Exactly. Good old London town. 
113,(Two senior boys stop.) 
114,"BAINES: Er, now then, you two. You're not paid to have fun, are you?"
115,Put a little backbone into it. 
116,"JENNY: Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. "
117,"HUTCHINSON: You there, what's your name again? "
118,"MARTHA: Martha, sir. Martha Jones. "
119,"HUTCHINSON: Tell me then, Jones. With hands like those, how can you"
120,tell when something's clean? 
121,"(They walk on, laughing.) "
122,"MARTHA: That's very funny, sir. "
123,"JENNY: Careful, now. Don't answer back. "
124,MARTHA: I'd answer back with my bucket over his head. 
125,"JENNY: Oh, I wish. Just think, though. In a few years time, boys like"
126,that'll be running the country. 
127,MARTHA: Nineteen thirteen. They might not.
128,
129,[Upper corridor]
130,
131,"BOY: Excuse me, ma'am. "
132,"(A neat woman in starched nurses uniform meets the Doctor, who is"
133,carrying a large pile of books.) 
134,"JOAN: Oh, good morning, Mister Smith. "
135,(He drops some of the books.) 
136,DOCTOR: There we go. 
137,JOAN: Let me help you. 
138,"DOCTOR: No, no, I've got it, no. Er, how best to retrieve? Tell you"
139,what. If you could take these 
140,"(Joan takes the books from his arms, and he picks up the fallen ones.) "
141,JOAN: Good. 
142,"DOCTOR: No harm done. So, er, how was Jenkins? "
143,JOAN: Oh just a cold. Nothing serious. I think he's missing his mother
144,more than anything. 
145,"DOCTOR: Oh, we can't have that. "
146,"JOAN: He received a letter this morning, so he's a lot more chipper. I"
147,appear to be holding your books. 
148,"DOCTOR: Yes, so you are. Sorry, sorry. Just let me. "
149,"JOAN: No, why don't I take half? "
150,"DOCTOR: Ah, brilliant idea. Brilliant. Perfect. Division of labour. "
151,JOAN: We make quite a team. 
152,DOCTOR: Don't we just. 
153,"JOAN: So, these books. Were they being taken in any particular"
154,direction? 
155,DOCTOR: Yes. This way. 
156,(In a smaller corridor.) 
157,"DOCTOR: I always say, Matron, give the boys a good head of steam,"
158,they'll soon wear themselves out. 
159,"JOAN: Truth be told, when it's just you and me, I'd much rather you"
160,"call me Nurse Redfern. Matron sounds rather well, matronly. "
161,DOCTOR: Ah. Nurse Redfern it is then. 
162,"JOAN: Though we've known each other all of two months, you could even"
163,say Joan. 
164,DOCTOR: Joan? 
165,JOAN: That's my name. 
166,"DOCTOR: Well, obviously. "
167,"JOAN: And it's John, isn't it? "
168,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, it is, yes. "
169,(At the notice board at the top of a flight of stairs.) 
170,"JOAN: Have you seen this, John? The annual dance at the village hall"
171,"tomorrow. It's nothing formal, but rather fun by all accounts. Do you"
172,think you'll go? 
173,DOCTOR: I hadn't thought about it. 
174,"JOAN: It's been ages since I've been to a dance, only no one's asked"
175,me. 
176,(The Doctor starts backing away nervously.) 
177,"DOCTOR: Well, I should imagine that you'd be, er, I mean, I never"
178,"thought you'd be one for. I mean, there's no reason why you shouldn't."
179,"If you do, you may not. I, I probably won't, but even if I did then I"
180,couldn't. I mean I wouldn't want to 
181,JOAN: The stairs. 
182,DOCTOR: What about the stairs? 
183,JOAN: They're right behind you. 
184,(And down he goes in a flurry of books and papers.)
185,
186,[Doctor's room]
187,
188,(Joan tends to the back of the Doctor's head.) 
189,JOAN: Stop it. I get boys causing less fuss than this. 
190,DOCTOR: Because it hurts. 
191,(Martha bursts in.) 
192,MARTHA: Is he all right? 
193,"JOAN: Excuse me, Martha. It's hardly good form to enter a master's"
194,study without knocking. 
195,MARTHA: Sorry. Right. Yeah. 
196,(She goes back to the door and knocks on it.) 
197,"MARTHA: But is he all right? They said you fell down the stairs, Sir. "
198,"DOCTOR: No, it was just a tumble, that's all. "
199,MARTHA: Have you checked for concussion? 
200,JOAN: I have. And I daresay I know a lot more about it than you. 
201,MARTHA: Sorry. I'll just tidy your things. 
202,"DOCTOR: I was just telling Nurse Redfern, Matron, about my dreams. They"
203,"are quite remarkable tales. I keep imagining that I'm someone else, and"
204,that I'm hiding. 
205,JOAN: Hiding? In what way? 
206,DOCTOR: They're almost every night. This is going to sound silly. 
207,JOAN: Tell me. 
208,"DOCTOR: I dream, quite often, that I have two hearts. "
209,"JOAN: Well, then. I can be the judge of that. Let's find out."
210,(Joan uses her stethoscope to listen to the Doctor's chest.) 
211,"JOAN: I can confirm the diagnosis. Just one heart, singular. "
212,"DOCTOR: I have er, I have written down some of these dreams in the form"
213,of fiction. Not that it would be of any interest. 
214,JOAN: I'd be very interested. 
215,"DOCTOR: Well, I've never actually shown it to anyone before. "
216,(The Doctor gives Joan the handwritten book.) 
217,JOAN: A Journal of Impossible Things. 
218,(Lots of inky scrawl and pictures.) 
219,JOAN: Just look at these creatures. 
220,(A Dalek.) 
221,JOAN: Such imagination. 
222,DOCTOR: It's become quite a hobby. 
223,"(The Moxx of Balhoon, Autons labelled as plastic men, one of the"
224,Pompadour clockwork robots.) 
225,JOAN: It's wonderful. And quite an eye for the pretty girls. 
226,(Rose Tyler.) 
227,"DOCTOR: Oh no, no, she's just an invention. This character, Rose. I"
228,"call her, Rose. Seems to disappear later on. "
229,"(Cybermen and the Tardis, labelled magic box.) "
230,"DOCTOR: Ah, that's the box. The blue box. It's always there. Like a"
231,like a magic carpet. This funny little box that transports me to far
232,away places. 
233,JOAN: Like a doorway? 
234,DOCTOR: Mmm. 
235,(Sketches of earlier Doctors.) 
236,DOCTOR: I sometimes think how magical life would be if stories like
237,this were true. 
238,JOAN: If only. 
239,DOCTOR: It's just a dream. 
240,(And drawings of the pocket watch.)
241,
242,[Corridor]
243,
244,(Martha runs after Joan.) 
245,MARTHA: Ma'am? That book. 
246,"JOAN: Oh, I'll look after it. Don't worry. He did say I could read it. "
247,"MARTHA: But it's silly, that's all. Just stories. "
248,"JOAN: Who is he, Martha? "
249,MARTHA: I'm sorry? 
250,JOAN: It's like he's left the kettle on. Like he knows he has something
251,"to get back to, but he can't remember what. "
252,MARTHA: That's just him. 
253,"JOAN: You arrived with him, didn't you? He found you employment here at"
254,"the school, isn't that right? "
255,MARTHA: I used to work for the family. He just sort of inherited me. 
256,"JOAN: Well, I'd be careful. If you don't mind my saying, you sometimes"
257,seem a little familiar with him. Best remember your position. 
258,"MARTHA: Yes, ma'am. "
259,[Dormitory]
260,
261,"HUTCHINSON: Ah, Latimer. Here you are, Latin"
262,translation. 
263,(He throws a text book to the floor by the younger boy's feet. Dare I
264,say that Latimer would appear to be Hutchinson's fag?) 
265,HUTCHINSON: Blasted Catullus. I want it done by morning. 
266,"LATIMER: Yes, sir. "
267,HUTCHINSON: And no mistakes. I want it written by best handwriting. 
268,(Hutchinson reads a letter.) 
269,"HUTCHINSON: Listen, Father says he's been promoted. That means more"
270,money. Might end up in a better school. 
271,"LATIMER: Ah, he should enjoy it, sir. My uncle had a six month posting"
272,in Johannesburg. Says it was the most beautiful countryside on God's
273,Earth. 
274,HUTCHINSON: What are you talking about? 
275,LATIMER: Africa. Your father. 
276,HUTCHINSON: You been reading my post? 
277,LATIMER: What? 
278,HUTCHINSON: You said Africa. I've only just read the word myself. How
279,did you know that? 
280,(He pushes Latimer up against the wall.) 
281,LATIMER: I haven't. 
282,HUTCHINSON: Have you been spying on me? 
283,LATIMER: No. I just guessed. 
284,HUTCHINSON: What's that supposed to mean? 
285,"LATIMER: I'm good at guessing, that's all. "
286,HUTCHINSON: Idiot. 
287,LATIMER: Sometimes I say things and they turn out to be correct. Just
288,little things. Tiny things. I can't help it. It's just some sort of
289,luck. 
290,"BAINES: Right, well, never mind that little toad. Who's for beer? "
291,HUTCHINSON: You've got beer? 
292,"BAINES: No, but Baxter's hidden a secret supply in Blackdown woods. "
293,HUTCHINSON: What are you waiting for? 
294,(Baines opens the window to climb out.) 
295,HUTCHINSON: Make sure the Bursar's down the pub before you go past his
296,window. 
297,"BAINES: A bottle for everyone, is it? "
298,"HUTCHINSON: And none for the filth. And hurry back, Baines, I'm"
299,parched.
300,
301, [Outside the pub]
302,
303,(Evening. Martha brings two pints to a table.) 
304,"MARTHA: Ooo, it's freezing out here. Why can't we have a drink inside"
305,the pub? 
306,JENNY: Now don't be ridiculous. You do get these notions! It's all very
307,"well, those Suffragettes. but that's London. That's miles away. "
308,"MARTHA: But don't you just want to scream sometimes, having to bow and"
309,scrape and behave. Don't you just
310,want to tell them? 
311,JENNY: I don't know. Things must be different in your country. 
312,"MARTHA: Yeah, well they are. Thank God I'm not staying. "
313,JENNY: You keep saying that. 
314,MARTHA: Just you wait. One more month and I'm as free as the wind. I
315,"wish you could come with me, Jenny. You'd love it. "
316,JENNY: Where are you going to go? 
317,MARTHA: Anywhere. Just look up there. Imagine you could go all the way
318,out to the stars. 
319,JENNY: You don't half say mad things. 
320,"MARTHA: That's where I'm going. Into the sky, all the way out. "
321,(Something flashes in the sky.) 
322,MARTHA: Did you see that? 
323,JENNY: See what? 
324,"MARTHA: Did you see it, though? Right up there, just for a second. "
325,"JENNY: Martha, there's nothing there. "
326,(Joan is walking through a field when she is blinded by a green light
327,that appears to be searching the ground. Then it disappears. She runs.)
328,
329,"MARTHA: Matron, are you all right? "
330,JOAN: Did you see that? There was something in the woods. This light. 
331,(The Doctor arrives.) 
332,"DOCTOR: Anything wrong, ladies? Far too cold to be standing around in"
333,"the dark, don't you. "
334,"JOAN: There, there. Look in the sky. "
335,(A light crosses the sky.) 
336,"JENNY: Oh, that's beautiful. "
337,DOCTOR: All gone. Commonly known as a meteorite. It's just rocks
338,"falling to the ground, that's all. "
339,JOAN: It came down in the woods. 
340,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. No, they always look close, when actually they're"
341,"miles off. Nothing left but a cinder. Now, I should escort you back to"
342,the school. Ladies? 
343,"MARTHA: No, we're fine, thanks. "
344,DOCTOR: Then I shall bid you goodnight. 
345,(The Doctor and Joan leave.) 
346,"MARTHA: Jenny, where was that? On the horizon, where the light was"
347,headed. 
348,JENNY: That's by Cooper's Field. 
349,(Martha leaves.) 
350,JENNY: You can't just run off. It's dark. You'll break a leg. 
351,(Jenny follows Martha.)
352,
353,[Cooper's Field]
354,
355,(Baines has found the stash of beer bottles when
356,the green light comes down to the ground near him. It lands and the
357,light goes out. He goes to investigate.) 
358,"BAINES: I say, hello? Was that some kind of aeroplane? You chaps all"
359,right? 
360,(He walks into a green forcefield.) 
361,"BAINES: What? That's, that's impossible. "
362,(He presses his hands against it and moves them sideways. There is a
363,clunk as a hatch opens.) 
364,BAINES: Some kind of door. Hello? Is anyone there? 
365,(He goes inside. Martha and Jenny arrive.) 
366,JENNY: There you are. Nothing there. I told you so. 
367,MARTHA: And that's Cooper's Field? 
368,"JENNY: As far as the eye can see, and no falling star. Now come on, I'm"
369,"frozen to the bone, let's go. As your Mister Smith says, nothing to"
370,see.
371,
372,[Spacecraft]
373,
374,BAINES: But I don't understand. Who are you? 
375,FATHER : We are the Family. 
376,"MOTHER : Far more important, who are you, little thing? "
377,BAINES: My name's Baines. Jeremy Baines. Please can I go? 
378,"MOTHER : I'm so sorry, Baines Jeremy Baines, but I don't think you"
379,can ever leave. 
380,"BAINES: But, who are you? Why can't I see you? "
381,FATHER : Why would you want to see us? 
382,BAINES: I want to know what you look like. 
383,"MOTHER : Oh, that's easily answered, because very soon we will look"
384,so familiar. 
385,(Baines screams.)
386,
387,[Dormitory]
388,
389,(Latimer is polishing shoes as the school clock
390,chimes the hour. The older boys are playing cards.) 
391,HUTCHINSON: Where is he? Promises us beer then vanishes into the night.
392,
393,(There is a knock at the window.) 
394,HUTCHINSON: There he is. Let him in. 
395,"(One of the boys opens the window and Baines enters, slowly.) "
396,"HUTCHINSON: Baines, you dolt. I thought you'd been caught by the"
397,"rozzers. Well, then? Where is it, man? Where's the blessed beer? "
398,BAINES: There was no beer. It was gone. 
399,"HUTCHINSON: Damn it all, I've been waiting. Pretty poor show, Baines, I"
400,have to say. What's the matter with you? Caught sniffles out there? 
401,"BAINES: Yes, I must have. It was cold. Very cold. "
402,"HUTCHINSON: Well, don't spread it about, I don't want your germs. Come"
403,"on, might as well get some sleep. Come on, chaps. Maybe tomorrow."
404,Jackson's got some beer in the pavilion. 
405,(Baines and Latimer look at each other. Baines sniffs and Latimer goes
406,back to his polishing.)
407,
408,[Tardis]
409,
410,(Martha bicycles out to an old barn and goes
411,inside. She uses the key she was given at the end of 42 to unlock the
412,Tardis.) 
413,MARTHA: Hello. I'm talking to a machine 
414,[Memory - Tardis]
415,
416,DOCTOR: Get down! They're following us. They can
417,follow us wherever we go. Right across the universe. They're never
418,"going to stop. Martha, you trust me, don't you? "
419,MARTHA: Of course I do. 
420,"DOCTOR: Because it all depends on you. Martha, this watch is me. "
421,"MARTHA: Right, okay, gotcha. No, hold on. Completely lost. "
422,"DOCTOR: Those creatures are hunters. They can sniff out anyone, and me"
423,"being a Time Lord, well, I'm unique. They can track me down across the"
424,whole of time and space. 
425,MARTHA: Huh. And the good news is? 
426,"DOCTOR: They can smell me, they haven't seen me. And their life span'll"
427,"be running out, so we hide. Wait for them to die. "
428,MARTHA: But they can track us down. 
429,DOCTOR: That's why I've got to do it. I have to stop being a Time Lord.
430,I'm going to become human. 
431,(A headset is lowered from the ceiling of the Tardis.) 
432,DOCTOR: Never thought I'd use this. All the times I've wondered. 
433,MARTHA: What does it do? 
434,DOCTOR: Chameleon Arch. Rewrites my biology. Literally changes every
435,single cell in my body. I've set it to human. 
436,(He puts the watch into the headset.) 
437,"DOCTOR: Now, the Tardis will take care of everything. Invent a life"
438,"story for me, find me a setting and integrate me. Can't do the same for"
439,you. You'll just have to improvise. I should have just enough residual
440,awareness to let you in. 
441,"MARTHA: But, hold on. If you're going to rewrite every single cell,"
442,isn't it going to hurt? 
443,"DOCTOR: Oh, yeah. It hurts. "
444,(Martha watches the Doctor suffer.) 
445,[Tardis]
446,
447,(Martha turns on a recording the Doctor made
448,earlier.) 
449,"DOCTOR [on scanner]: This working? Martha, before I change, here's a"
450,"list of instructions for when I'm human. One, don't let me hurt anyone."
451,"We can't have that, but you know what humans are like. Two, don't worry"
452,about the Tardis. I'll put it on emergency power so they can't detect

478,"DOCTOR: Now, be honest, Timothy, you should be the very top. You're a"
479,clever boy. You seem to be hiding it. Where is that book? And I know
480,why. Keeping your head low avoids the mockery of your classmates. But

921,CLARK: There will be silence! All of you! 
922,(Scarecrows enter.) 
923,"CLARK: I said, silence! "
924,"CHAMBERS: Mister Clarke, what's going on? "
925,(He gets vapourised.) 
926,"MARTHA: Mister Smith? Everything I told you, just forget it! Don't say"
927,anything. 
928,"BAINES: We asked for silence! Now then, we have a few questions for"
929,Mister Smith. 
930,"LUCY: No, better than that. The teacher. He's the Doctor. I heard them"
931,talking. 
932,BAINES: You took human form. 
933,"DOCTOR: Of course I'm human. I was born human, as were you, Baines. And"
934,"Jenny, and you, Mister Clark. What is going on? This is madness. "
935,"BAINES: Ooo, and a human brain, too. Simple, thick and dull. "
936,JENNY: But he's no good like this.

951,CLARK: Then let's have you. 
952,(Clark takes Joan and puts his gun to her head.) 
953,"BAINES: Have you enjoyed it, Doctor, being human? Has it taught you"
954,"wonderful things? Are you better, richer, wiser? Then let's see you"
955,answer this. Which one of them do you want us to kill? Maid or matron?
956,Your friend or your lover? Your choice.
