23,(A Dalek descends through a hole it has blown in the roof.- see Resolution) 
24,DALEK: Exterminate! The Doctor must be destroyed! 
25,(The Tardis and her crew are there.) 
26,"DOCTOR: Earth is protected by me and my mates, this year and every other. Here we go! "
27,(She sonicks off the forcefield and runs to our left while the others go right.) 
28,DALEK: Exterminate! 
29,(She slides up behind the Dalek.) 
30,DOCTOR: Now attach the parts. 
31,DALEK: Weapon failure. 
32,"YASMIN: The parts are on, Doctor!  "
33,DOCTOR: Get clear! 
34,(The Dalek melts and explodes.)

39,
40,(The remains of the Dalek are being taken away.) 
41,ARMEN: Is everyone all right in there? 
42,RACHEL: We had an accident. People got hurt. The issue's been dealt with. There'll be someone waiting at Depository 23. 
43,"ARMEN: Long time since we opened that one. Whatever that is, is it safe? "
44,RACHEL: Just get it there quick as you can. 
45,ARMEN: Am I allowed to stop for a cuppa? 
46,"RACHEL: Oh, only cos it's you. How's your mum, by the way? "
47,"ARMEN: Yeah, you know... "
48,RACHEL: Must be hard. 
49,ARMEN: Yeah. Best get on the road.

53,(He's pulled the lorry in to refill his thermos at FI's Teas.) 
54,ARMEN: Hi. 
55,TEA LADY: Hi. 
56,"ARMEN: Can I get a cup of tea in there, please? Thank you. "
57,"TEA LADY: There you go, love. "
58,ARMEN: Cheers. 
59,TEA LADY: Have a good day. 
60,ARMEN: Thanks very much. Have a good one. 
61,"(He walks back to his lorry, takes a drink, starts to feel dizzy, drops the thermos, collapses. The tea lady closes the serving hatch, drags his body "
62,"and dumps it in the back of the lorry with the remains of the Dalek, then drives the rig away.)"

65,
66,"PATTERSON: When you said breakfast meeting, I presumed it would be somewhere that served breakfast. Jo Patterson. "
67,"LEO: Leo Rugazzi. CEO, Rugazzi Technologies.  "
68,ROBERTSON: I acquired Leo's company 18 months ago. 
69,(Arachnids in the UK...) 
70,PATTERSON: I see you buying a lot of companies right now. They're calling you the American Mike Ashley. 
71,ROBERTSON: There's a lot of value in the market today. 
72,PATTERSON: Having your political ambitions ruined by that little toxic waste scandal seems to have been a blessing in disguise. 
73,ROBERTSON: That's a very sensitive subject for me. 
74,LEO: I just wanted to say that I am super-psyched about having a proper Technology Secretary at last. 
75,"PATTERSON: I was super-psyched too, until they told me that my budget was Â£2.70. "
76,"ROBERTSON: Well, if anybody can make it work, it's you, Jo. "
77,PATTERSON: Show me why we're here. 
78,ROBERTSON: Leo has something... revolutionary to show you.
79,
80,[Overlooking a tunnel entrance]
81,
82,(Angry mob facing a line of police in riot gear.) 
83,ROBERTSON: Just a small role-play. We all know the problems facing the world today. Trust in our leaders is at an all-time low. 
84,Civil unrest is growing. Security budgets are falling. Our police forces are under pressure. 
85,(Fire bombs are thrown.) 
86,"PATTERSON: Goodness, I hope no-one's going to get hurt. "
87,ROBERTSON: The problem is obvious. Here's the solution. 
88,(Out of the tunnel trundles a shiny new black Dalek. It surveys the situation and opens fire - with a jet of water.) 
89,LEO: Built-in water cannon. 
90,(What should be the sink plunger emits gas.) 
91,LEO: And CS gas. We're not using actual CS gas. 
92,ROBERTSON: I still think it would have been fine. 
93,(The Dalek emits a highpitched noise. The 'rioters' clutch their heads in pain. The trio have ear defenders on.) 
94,LEO: Sonic deterrent!
95,
96,[Building]
97,
98,"LEO: Entirely robotic with an AI interface programme for every eventuality, thanks to extensive real-world scenario testing. "
99,"Er, solar... solar powered with A-grade energy rating. "
100,PATTERSON: You built this yourself? 
101,"LEO: Oh, pretty much. Er, once Mister Robertson became involved, he really helped us turbo-boost the whole project. Actually, talking about... "
102,"ROBERTSON: Er, she gets the picture, Leo. That's fine. This is a game-changer, Jo. It's the security equivalent of the iPhone. "
103,PATTERSON: Shall we talk in private?
104,
105,[Empty lot]
106,
107,PATTERSON: I want them built and beta tested in my constituency. 
108,"ROBERTSON: Yes, yes, as discussed. When those car firms deserted you, I bought up all the plants. I own them now. So we repurpose, New infrastructure, new jobs. "
109,"This is going to be a big win for you, Jo. A flagship policy from our dynamic new Technology Secretary, and it looks like, er, your party's going to need a new leader soon. "
110,"PATTERSON: What does he know, young Leo? "
111,ROBERTSON: Only that I got the parts from some unknown source. 
112,PATTESON: If it ever gets out that I tipped you off about advanced technology being transported from GCHQ... 
113,"ROBERTSON: It won't. We trust each other. This is a good arrangement, Jo. You're simply facilitating an acquisition and I'm cutting you in on the IP. "
114,Nobody knows. Everybody wins. 
115,PATTERSON: How long will it take? 
116,"ROBINSON: Er, a year, give or take."

122,"(The cell is cut out of the asteroid rock, with lasers for window bars. The Doctor marks the new day with another scratch on the wall. She's been there quite a while. "
123,Her meal is transmatted in.) 
124,DOCTOR: Urgh... 
125,"(The exercise symbol lights up so she walks down a corridor, following the flashing arrows on the wall.) "
126,"DOCTOR: Morning, camera 37. Morning, camera 38. "
127,(Through a security door to a large area of individual spaces divided by energised fences.) 
128,"DOCTOR: Morning, Angela. "
129,(She blinks and the Weeping Angel moves.) 
130,"DOCTOR: All right, Bonnie and Clyde? "
131,(They are Ood.) 
132,"DOCTOR: Tiny! How many times? You can't eat the cage. Believe me, I've tried. "
133,(It's a Pting. And back to her cell. Lights out.) 
134,"DOCTOR: Bedtime story, Doctor? Yes, please, Doctor. One of the classics? Ooo, yes, please. Settle down, then. (from memory) "
135,"Mister and Mrs Dursley, of number four Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal... "
136,(Banging on the wall.) 
137,DOCTOR: What? Who's there? Stay strong. People are waiting for you.
138,
139,[A Tardis]
140,
141,(Graham and Ryan walk up to a detached house on a new estate. The door opens for them. It's the Tardis from Timeless Children.) 
142,"YASMIN: I keep thinking - she was barely in here for a couple of minutes and yet she coded the entry lock to our DNA, just like on her own Tardis. "
143,"Maybe that's cos she wanted us to be able to follow her, to find her, cos she needed us. I'm going to work it out. I must be able to work it out. "
144,(She's got a big board of clues.) 
145,"GRAHAM: Happy New Year, Yaz. "
146,YASMIN: When was it New Year? 
147,RYAN: You been sleeping in here? 
148,YASMIN: Maybe. 
149,"GRAHAM: Yaz, you can't keep being here all the time. The Doc, you know, she went to do something she knew might kill her. "
150,We've just got to assume she didn't make it.  
151,YASMIN: Why? Why do we have to assume that? 
152,"RYAN: Mate, we've been back ten months. We have to get on with our lives. That's what she told us. That's what she wanted for us. "
153,YASMIN: But what if she needs us? How many times has she saved us? 
154,"RYAN: Yaz, face up to it, we don't know how to find her. All right? And there's something else. Graham, show her.  "
155,"GRAHAM: Mmm-hmm. The Doc would really want us to keep an eye on the planet, right? Look, this is leaked online footage of what they're calling "
156,"a prototype security drone. Apparently, this was taken over a year ago. Just watch. "
157,YASMIN: That's a Dalek.  
158,GRAHAM: Mmm-hmm. 
159,YASMIN: But how's that possible? 
160,RYAN: No idea.  
161,GRAHAM: Watch. 
162,YASMIN: Jack Robertson. Spider guy.  
163,GRAHAM: Mmm. 
164,YASMIN: He's in league with a Dalek? 
165,RYAN: That's what we're going to find out. 
166,"GRAHAM: And that's what the Doc would do if she was here, so... are you with us?"
167,
168,[Woodland]
169,
170,(It's raining.) 
171,"ROBERTSON: Well, it's an honour to be summoned by the Prime Minister in waiting... even if it is a bit, er, rural. How many hours till we get the results from the ballots? "
172,PATTERSON: The numbers are on my side.That's why I wanted to talk. 
173,"ROBERTSON: You're not having doubts about our agreement, are you? "
174,PATTERSON: Quite the opposite. I want to expedite our project. 
175,ROBERTSON: Six of the sweetest words in the English language. 
176,PATTERSON: I want an immediate national roll-out of security drones. 
177,ROBERTSON: National? But we've only just started regional beta testing. 
178,PATTERSON: And I want it at no cost to the British taxpayer. 
179,"ROBERTSON: Why, Jo, this is starting to sound like a shakedown. "
180,"PATTERSON: This country can be your shop window for global sales. Unless, of course, you'd like the Treasury to take a look at how much tax all your companies pay over here? "
181,ROBERTSON: Ah. Well played... Prime Minister. Well played.
182,
183,{Outside Robertson HQ]
184,
185,ROBERTSON: (on phone) Leo? I'm outside. Three minutes. 
186,RYAN: Yo. Remember us? 
187,(Robertson assumes the position.) 
188,ROBERTSON: Take the car! Just leave my face. 
189,GRAHAM: What? 
190,"ROBERTSON: Oh, no. Not you guys. "
191,"RYAN: Yeah, us, cos we know all about you and that Dalek. "
192,ROBERTSON: The what?  
193,GRAHAM: The Dalek. The most deadly creature in the universe. We saw you with it. 
194,ROBERTSON: What is this word that you keep using? 
195,"YASMIN: Oh, don't play innocent. Dalek. Whatever you're doing with it, we're going to stop you. "
196,GUARD: Hands in the air! Step away from the car! 
197,(Armed guards arrive.) 
198,"ROBERTSON: What, you didn't think I'd increase my security since the last time we met? You're lucky you're not all dead on the ground. Get rid of 'em, boys. "
199,(Walking away.) 
200,"GRAHAM: Well, that didn't go exactly to plan, did it? "
201,"RYAN: I like that whole ""whatever you're doing, we're going to stop you"" vibe. Very Doctory. "
202,YASMIN: Doesn't work when I do it. We didn't get anywhere near an explanation from him. 
203,"GRAHAM: If we had the Doctor's psychic paper or we knew how to work that Tardis, we could get into his office and see what's going on. "
204,"RYAN: Yeah, but we don't, so we're going to have to try and figure out another way. "
205,"GRAHAM: Yeah. This is hard, innit?"
206,
207,[Prison]
208,
209,(The daily routine.) 
210,"DOCTOR: Morning, camera 38. "
211,"(In her exercise yard, she sees a Silent.) "
212,"DOCTOR: Oh, I forgot you were here. "
213,HARKNESS: What about this face? Remember this? 
214,DOCTOR: Jack. Jack! 
215,"HARKNESS: I knew you would look better in these colours than me. Hello, Doctor. "
216,DOCTOR: What are you doing here? 
217,"HARKNESS: What do you think I'm doing here? Breaking you out. Temporal-freezing gateway disinhibitor bubble. Catchy, right? If it were me, I'd have called it a breakout ball. "
218,"Freezes time temporarily, breaks through walls. Only problem is... it doesn't last long. "
219,(He activates the bubble and steps through the electric fence to join her.) 
220,HARKNESS: Hi! 
221,DOCTOR: Have you had work done? 
222,HARKNESS: You can talk! Now shut up and run. 
223,(They run the bubble down the corridor.) 
224,"HARKNESS: I heard a rumour you were in here, so I committed a few crimes. Well, maybe a lot of crimes. Maybe more than I should have. "
225,DOCTOR: What sort of crimes? 
226,HARKNESS: Left turn.  
227,DOCTOR: Oh! 
228,HARKNESS: You're going to take the moral high ground with me when I'm breaking you out of prison? Be grateful!  
229,DOCTOR: Front door! How long has this thing got left? 
230,HARKNESS: 11 seconds till expiry! Go! 
231,(They arrive in a room then the bubble expires.) 
232,DOCTOR: Phew! 
233,HARKNESS: Took 19 years to get to the cell next to you. Hope you had enough to occupy your mind.  
234,DOCTOR: Too much. 
235,HARKNESS: Here we go. One secretly stashed vortex manipulator. 
236,(The alarms sound.) 
237,HARKNESS: Wondered how long that would take. We need to go now. 
238,DOCTOR: How did you manage to smuggle that in here? 
239,"HARKNESS: You really want me to answer that? Oh, I've missed you...very much. (hug) Let's go."

241,[Office]
242,
243,"(On the TV, BBC News reports Jo Patterson elected party leader and new Prime Minister.) "
244,"LEO: Operation, logistics and production have all been called in. Everyone has been told maximum capacity, maximum speed, and our beta partners are working "
245,"through the night training staff, under our supervisors. All under NDAs, of... of course. We think we might have enough in place to... well, to make the deadline. "
246,"ROBERTSON: Great. Great job, Leo. This is going to be good for us. "
247,"LEO: I... I... I can't help but feel a little... well, you know, a little worried about the speed of this. "
248,"ROBERTSON: Everybody's worried, Leo. We live in uncertain times. Do you want to win? Embrace the uncertainty. Live in the worry. "
249,"LEO: Oh, okay. Er, so... so...there's... there's just something I... I needed to share on this project. When I first started working on that casing, "
250,"I broke it down into the tiniest components. I made it my mission to, well, to understand everything about it. "
251,"ROBERTSON: Yes, and you did a great job. These machines are going to change the world. "
252,LEO: I'm not talking about the machines. I'm talking about what was inside the original artefact. 
253,"ROBERTSON: There's nothing inside, Leo. It was a burnt-out shell. "
254,"LEO: Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you. This granular investigation I've been doing, I... Well, I found something more. Organic remnants inside the machine.  "
255,Tiny cellular traces scattered across the casing. 
256,"ROBERTSON: Where are you going with this, Leo? "
257,"LEO: Well... Look, I'll ju... I'll just show you. "
258,
259,[Laboratory]
260,
261,"LEO: Look. Just here, see? I.. I took the cellular traces and I... ..and I cloned them. Grew them. I grew a creature. "
262,(A blobby thing with tentacles in a tank.) 
263,"ROBERTSON: Oh, my God! "
264,"LEO: It's beautiful, isn't it?  "
265,ROBERTSON: No! Are you insane? That's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life. What were you thinking? 
266,LEO: What? It's intelligent. I hooked it into the intra-neural network and... and there were flickers of activity. It understood our systems immediately. 
267,"ROBERTSON: You did what?! All right. Not another word. You've overreached, Leo. I want this incinerated immediately. "
268,LEO: What?! 
269,ROBERTSON: No argument! 
270,(Grabs Leo's ear.) 
271,LEO: Ow! 
272,"ROBERTSON: I don't want to see a trace of this. This never happened, you never showed it to me, this thing never existed. Do you understand? "
273,"LEO: Okay, okay. "
274,(Lets go.) 
275,"ROBERTSON: You know what your problem is, Leo? You're too clever. This is why people don't like experts."

292,
293,"DOCTOR: We're out. I'm back. My own Tardis. Captain Jack Harkness, gold star for rescuing. "
294,"HARKNESS: Told your friends if you ever need help, I'd be there. Wow. Nice upgrade in here. Which way's my room? "
295,DOCTOR: You don't have a room. You've never had a room. 
296,"HARKNESS: I had a suite with its own cocktail lounge. They gave you my message, about the lone Cyberman? You didn't give it the Cyberium? "
297,DOCTOR: It's a long story.  
298,HARKNESS: What? 
299,DOCTOR: I fixed it. Eventually. Just about. Sort of. 
300,HARKNESS: Why were you in prison in the first place? 
301,"DOCTOR: Evading the Judoon. Twice at once. Then once I was in, they took 7,000 other offences into consideration. "
302,HARKNESS: They stopped at seven? 
303,"DOCTOR: I was in prison for being me... right at the point when I wasn't sure what that meant. Ah, it's been a tough few decades. "
304,"HARKNESS: You're okay now, yeah? "
305,"DOCTOR: Oh, I guess we'll find out. Wakey-wakey. "
306,(The Tardis powers up.) 
307,HARKNESS: Hey! 
308,DOCTOR: Nice nap? Thanks for waiting. I had a lot to think about in there. And three very special people I've missed. 
309,"HARKNESS: One of them was me, right? "
310,DOCTOR: You never change. 
311,HARKNESS: Wish I could say the same. 
312,DOCTOR: Right. Find me my fam.

316,"YASMIN: This is what I've got so far. Remnants of the Dalek we fought at GCHQ were cleared but then stolen. The driver is missing, presumed dead.  "
317,RYAN: Now Robertson's got his hands on it. 
318,"GRAHAM: Well, he can't have, because you sent that creature thing that was inside it into a supernova, so... "
319,"RYAN: Maybe there's more of them here on Earth, and one's got Robertson under their control? "
320,"YASMIN: Ryan, shh! "
321,(Distant sound of Tardis materialisation getting louder. A wind blows as air is displaced.) 
322,YASMIN: Please. Please be her. 
323,"(Tardis materialises, door opens.) "
324,DOCTOR: Hi! I was in space jail. 
325,GRAHAM: You what? 
326,HARKNESS: Guess who got her out? 
327,"DOCTOR: You all met Jack, right? "
328,"HARKNESS: Hey, silver fox. "
329,GRAHAM: (taking a step back) Hello. 
330,YASMIN: We were worried about you! 
331,DOCTOR: What? How long's it been? A week? Two weeks? 
332,RYAN: Ten months. 
333,"HARKNESS: Er, whoops? "
334,DOCTOR: 
335,"No, it can't be. I set identical temporal coordinates to when I sent you back. "
336,"GRAHAM: Yeah, but your time machine ain't the best at running to time, is it, Doc? "
337,DOCTOR: I'm sorry. 
338,"RYAN: Yeah, well, it's done now, so... "
339,DOCTOR: Yeah.  
340,HARKNESS: So... what's new on planet Earth?

352,
353,"DOCTOR: So, it looks like a Dalek, but it can't be a Dalek... unless it is a Dalek. "
354,RYAN: Trust us. We've seen the footage. 
355,YASMIN: If you scan for Dalek DNA trace across the planet... 
356,"HARKNESS: Oh, she's good. "
357,"RYAN: Yeah, we all are. "
358,"GRAHAM: So, you've had dealings with Daleks as well, then? "
359,"HARKNESS: Yeah, they killed me once, long time ago. No big deal. "
360,RYAN: You look pretty healthy for a corpse.  
361,"HARKNESS: I know, right? I can be killed but I come back to life pretty quick. Partially her fault, partially a friend of hers on Earth called Rose. "
362,But she's trapped in a parallel universe now. 
363,YASMIN: She's what? 
364,"DOCTOR: Dalek DNA trace, Japan. Osaka. Well, sort of. Not an exact match. Ah, it's corrupted. I can't quite make sense of it. "
365,HARKNESS: I can check it out. Anyone want to come? 
366,YASMIN: I will! 
367,RYAN: I want a word with Robertson direct. 
368,"GRAHAM: Yeah, me too. "
369,"DOCTOR: Looks like he's recently opened a facility in Osaka. We could check it out, drop you on the way. "

378,ROBERTSON: What is that thing? 
379,"DOCTOR: I want to know what you're doing right now, and don't try calling security, cos I just blocked your phone lines. "

384,ROBERTSON: Welcome to the production line. 
385,DOCTOR: You're making Daleks. 
386,ROBERTSON: We're 3D-printing security drones.  
387,DOCTOR: What about what's inside? 
388,ROBERTSON: There's nothing inside. It's run by artificial intelligence. 
389,DOCTOR: What?  
390,ROBERTSON: Watch. (opens a casing) See? They're machines. There's the remote signal unit. 
391,DOCTOR: They're empty. 
392,ROBERTSON: Mmm-hmm.  
393,DOCTOR: You're messing with things you don't understand. The creature these are modelled on is the most evil killing machine in the universe.

410,YASMIN: Are they all like you there? 
411,"HARKNESS: No. I'm pretty special. Had a rough time, then? Without the Doctor? "
412,YASMIN: I don't know what you mean. 
413,"HARKNESS: I saw the way you shoved her. You thought she wasn't coming back, right? "
414,YASMIN: You're guessing a lot from a shove. 
415,HARKNESS: I have my own experience with the Doctor. 
416,YASMIN: I just missed her. I never stopped to think... 
417,"HARKNESS: Hey. When I was with the Doctor, I saw more than I could have ever dreamed. And then... we lost each other. I didn't know what happened to him. "
418,"If he was alive or... if I was ever going to see him again. Hard way to live. Being with the Doctor, you don't get to choose when it stops. "
419,Whether you leave her or... she leaves you. 
420,"YASMIN: It felt cruel... to be shown something I couldn't have any more. Felt like, er, I'd rather not have known. I'd rather not have met her, "
421,"cos having met her and then... being without her, that's worse. How do you deal with that? "
422,"HARKNESS: How many people in the universe get to meet the Doctor, let alone travel with her? We're the lucky ones, Yaz. Enjoy the journey while you're on it. "
423,Cos the joy... is worth the pain.

454,ROBERTSON: Please stop using that word. It has no meaning. 
455,"DOCTOR: Yes, it does. To billions of people, Dalek means hate. Daleks are creatures of hate and aggression. Daleks are insidious, relentless and clever, "

512,"RYAN: You're the Doctor. Same as before, same as always. "
513,"DOCTOR: Right. Same Doctor, same Ryan. Nothing's changed. "

540,ROBERTSON: Leo? 
541,DOCTOR: Don't get too close! 
542,ROBERTSON: I warned you about that thing. 
543,"DOCTOR: What have you done, Leo? Cloned the smallest trace of organic material, not understanding that Dalek consciousness can live within the tiniest fragment of their DNA. "
544,You weren't to know. You're safe. We're here for you. We're going to get you out of here alive. 
545,DALEK/LEO: You give this body false hope. 
546,"DOCTOR: All right, then, Dalek, or whatever you are, tell me how you've built all this. "
547,"DALEK/LEO: I connected myself into the neural network. I inserted myself into the organisation, into every network. I located this place, created it. "
548,"Every piece of equipment, every idea behind it... I did that. "
549,"ROBINSON: Wait a minute. First of all, that's not possible. Where did you get the purchase order numbers in the first place? "
550,"RYAN: Really, that's what's bugging you most right now? "
551,"DALEK/LEO: I used your systems to buy this building, to order equipment, to pay humans to construct and to continue the clone work. "
552,I used your systems to build an army all in my image. 
553,YASMIN: But where are the workers? Where are the people who did all the cloning? 
554,"DALEK/LEO: Once the experiments were working, they became... unnecessary. We found them another use. "

556,DALEK/LEO: Correct. 
557,ROBERTSON: This is a PR disaster. 
558,DOCTOR: But there's something else that's bugging me. What is it? 
559,YASMIN: Is it the light? The light's been changing really slowly ever since we've been here. 
560,"DOCTOR: Yes, it is. Thanks, Yaz. I missed you, Yaz. Right, why is that important? Oh, there's too much going on. Where was I? Yes. How are you going to get off this planet? "
561,DALEK/LEO: We will not. 
562,DOCTOR: I'm sorry? 
563,DALEK/LEO: The planet is ours. It will be converted. 
564,YASMIN: Converted into what? 
565,DALEK/LEO: We shall use this planet as a base from which to conquer this sector of the universe. 
566,"DOCTOR: There's a long way between squatting in a Japanese lab and subjugating humanity. I mean, you don't even have bodies. What are you going to do, "
567,"order people from your tanks? Even if you made it to those shells down there, which you can't. You can't. I mean, you definitely can't. The... "

569,"YASMIN: Doctor, what's the matter? "
570,DOCTOR: The light.  
571,DALEK/LEO: The shells were built in his factories. Do you think I've not augmented those designs also? 
572,DOCTOR: Where's the light? We have to turn off the light! 
573,"HARKNESS: Why, Doctor? "
574,DOCTOR: Ultraviolet light. The Recon Dalek used it to come back together.

768,"DOCTOR: You're gonna have to trust me on this, Yaz. When have I ever let you down before? I won't disappear again. "
769,(Tardis is in flight.) 
770,"YASMIN: Yeah, you will. One day, you will. "
771,(Tardis lands.) 
772,YASMIN: Where are we? 
773,"DOCTOR: Right, come here and monitor this timer. Jack, I need you to be ready to get everyone off that ship and detonate. Yaz'll tell you when."
774,
775,[Saucer]
776,
777,HARKNESS: What about the other Daleks?
778,
779,[Tardis]
780,
781,DOCTOR: I'm dealing with them!
782,
783,[Saucer]
784,
785,ROBERTSON: Oh! Hey. I'm a bit lost. 
786,(Alarm sounds.) 
787,"DALEK : Alert, alert! "
788,ROBERTSON: Didn't sound good. Do you want to get that? 
789,DALEK: Remain here. 
790,"DALEK : All Dalek units, report to central control. The Doctor is detected! Extermination formations, assemble! Tardis location identified! "
791,(The guys grab Robertson.) 
792,GRAHAM: Give us one good reason why we should save your life. 
793,ROBERTSON: Money? 
794,HARKNESS: I still say we should leave him here.  
795,GRAHAM: Yeah. 
796,DALEK: Exterminate! 
797,HARKNESS: Go! 
798,
799,[Mid-air]
800,
801,DALEKS: The Doctor's Tardis is located. Surround the Tardis! 
802,DOCTOR: Hey! Daleks! Over here! 
803,DALEK: It is the Doctor! The Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks! 
804,"DOCTOR: Yes, it is. And, yes, I am. I called you here and you came, like obedient little pets. Thanks for solving my problem. "
805,DALEK: Daleks are not pets of the Doctor! 
806,"DOCTOR: Yes, you are. Why? What are you going to do about it? Cos I'm just standing here, in my Tardis. "
807,DALEK: Attack the Tardis! Exterminate the Doctor! 
808,(The Doctor pushes both doors open and the Daleks fly inside.)
809,
810,[Saucer]
811,
812,GRAHAM: You're sure this is the right way? 
813,RYAN: There's Daleks everywhere! 
814,GRAHAM: We've got to get us out of here. 
815,DALEK: You are intruders! 
816,ROBERTSON: This is a terrible rescue! 
817,DALEK: Intruders located! Life forms identified! 
818,GRAHAM: We're surrounded! 
819,DALEK: Do not move! 
820,DALEK 2: Do not move! 
821,"RYAN: Hey, are we ready? Do I detonate? "
822,HARKNESS: Almost. Grab hold.
823,
824,[Tardis]
825,
826,"YASMIN: Now, Jack! Get off the ship!"
827,
828,[Saucer]
829,
830,"DALEK: Intruders, identify! "
831,HARKNESS: I'm Captain Jack Harkness. And I'm immortal. Ha! 
832,DALEK: Exterminate! 
833,(Vortex manipulator activated just before the Daleks fire. The Saucer explodes.)
834,
835,[A Tardis]
836,
837,SUPREME: Dalek craft destroyed! 
838,DALEK: Where is the Doctor?! Search the Tardis! Exterminate the Doctor! 
839,"DOCTOR [hologram]: Oh, mate! You fell for the old switcheroo. Awkward. That's not my Tardis. I had a spare one lying around, so I used the chameleon circuit to "
840,"make it look like mine, and guess who fell for it? You guys. "
841,DALEK: We shall find you. We have control of a Tardis! 
842,"DOCTOR [hologram]: No, you don't. Sorry. More bad news. I've programmed it to fold in on itself and send itself to the heart of the Void, "
843,which will of course break it apart and destroy you in the process. Thanks for helping today. Won't be seeing you later. 
844,"DALEK: You will not escape us, Doctor! "
845,"DOCTOR [hologram]: Yes, I will. Every time. "
846,(The Tardis dimensions fold down to a dot and vanish.)
847,
848,[Tardis]
849,
850,(The men materialise.) 
851,"RYAN: Oh, that was horrible.  "
852,GRAHAM:	I feel sick. 
853,ROBERTSON: What just happened to me? 
854,HARKNESS: Did we do it? 
855,YASMIN: We did it! 
856,"DOCTOR: Daleks all exiled. Now, you have got a lot of explaining to do. "
857,ROBERTSON: I was deliberately acting as a decoy.
858,
859,[Graham's home]
860,
861,"MAITLIS [TV]: They're calling him the saviour of humanity, the man who stood up to the invaders on behalf of us all. Now, as rumours intensify "
862,"that he may be in line for an honorary knighthood, Jack Robertson spoke to me from his home in the United States. "
863,"ROBERTSON [TV]: Emily, I did what any man - person, human person - would do in those circumstances. "
864,MAITLIS [TV]: There's even talk of a revived presidential run for you. 
865,"ROBERTSON [TV]: Well, I can't really answer to that. "
866,(TV off.) 
867,GRAHAM: Can you believe that? 
868,"RYAN: Yeah, I can. "
869,GRAHAM: We should go and meet the Doc. 
870,(Graham leaves the room.) 
871,RYAN: Yeah.
872,
873,[Tardis]
874,
875,(Parked outside the block of flats.) 
876,"HARKNESS : Sorry, lost track of time. Gwen Cooper sends her love, by the way. Says she took out a Dalek with a moped and her son's boxing gloves. "
877,"Hoo-hoo! Anyway, I'm going to stick around on Earth and catch up with her. I'll call ya. "
878,"DOCTOR: Send my love to Gwen. Okay, bye! Right, fam, I thought we could try the Meringue Galaxy. It's not a place, it's a restaurant "
879,where every course is meringue. And the furniture. Plus the waiters! 
880,GRAHAM: Love it! 
881,DOCTOR: All set?  
882,GRAHAM: Ready. 
883,YASMIN: Yep. 
884,RYAN: Nah. I think I'm going to stay here. 
885,DOCTOR: Yeah. 
886,"RYAN: Yeah. Me mates need me. And I know this sounds stupid, but... I feel like my planet needs me. You've got to fight for it, right? "
887,"Look, Doctor, before... before I met you, I didn't know what I wanted to do with me life. And... and now... And now, I know. "
888,DOCTOR: Ten months. I made it back too late. Missed my time with you. 
889,"RYAN: So, are we hugging, or...? "
890,(Big hug.) 
891,DOCTOR: What about you two? Are you going to...? 
892,"YASMIN: Stay? Yeah, definitely. "
893,DOCTOR: Yes! 
894,"YASMIN: I'm not ready to let you go yet. That's all right, isn't it? "
895,"RYAN: You've said it now, so... Of course it's all right. She needs you. "
896,DOCTOR: Yes for Yaz!  
897,RYAN: Hey. You're getting over me leaving quick enough. 
898,"DOCTOR: Two hearts. One happy, one sad. "
899,RYAN: Make sure she don't get in any trouble. 
900,YASMIN: It's going to be difficult. I'm holding you responsible for the planet while I'm away. 
901,RYAN: Yeah. Deal. 
902,DOCTOR: Graham? 
903,"RYAN: Look, it's all right, you know. I'm all grown up now, so...you can go with them. "
904,"GRAHAM: Yeah, well... Yeah, well, you know, there's lots to explore, so much more to see. You know... But, er... I don't want to miss out on you, "
905,"you know, and being here without you ain't going to be the same. You know, I'll always be looking around, then, to say stuff to you, you know? "
906,"You see, Ryan, you're my family. And I remember, Doc, what you said, you know, that we... we wouldn't come back the same people, and you're right. "
907,Just not in the way I thought. I'm ready. I wanna... I wanna be at home with my grandson. What? 
908,"RYAN: I just thought I'd have the place to myself, you know. "
909,"GRAHAM: Ha. No such luck. Yaz. I'm sure I'll see you soon, eh? Keep doing humanity proud. "
910,YASMIN: I'm going to miss you. 
911,"GRAHAM: Doc. Thank you so much. Right. Well, come on, son. "
912,"DOCTOR: Hey. (group hug) Bye, fam. "
913,GRAHAM: Yeah. Right. 
914,"DOCTOR: Oh, wait. Take these. Might come in handy. "
915,(Psychic papers.) 
916,"GRAHAM: Oh. Ta. Oh! And, Doc, I was wrong. We do get aliens in Sheffield. "
917,(Ryan and Graham leave the Tardis.) 
918,"DOCTOR: I could always use the Tardis to go back, arrive an hour after you guys, change the timeline. Then we'd have more time together.  "
919,YASMIN: It's okay to be sad.
920,
921,[Moors]
922,
923,(Graham steadies Ryan on his bicycle.)  
924,"GRAHAM: Okay, three, two, one, go! Yes, go on, Ryan! You're doing it, son! Go on, son! Come on! "
925,(Ryan looks back and falls off.) 
926,"GRAHAM: Oh, great. Ryan, you okay, son? "
927,RYAN: Yeah. 
928,GRAHAM: Yeah?  
929,RYAN: Yeah. 
930,"GRAHAM: Well, look, definitely further. "
931,RYAN: Yeah. Maybe. 
932,"GRAHAM: No, definitely. "
933,"RYAN: I was looking online earlier. Some weird stuff going on in a village in Finland. Troll invasion, so the locals are saying. "
934,"GRAHAM: Yeah, I saw that. And you know there's a quarry in Korea that's shut down because the workers are reporting they saw gravel creatures come to life. "
935,RYAN: Psychic paper. 
936,GRAHAM: Yeah. These'll get us in anywhere. 
937,"RYAN: Yeah, Finland, Korea. "
938,"GRAHAM: Well, then, what are we waiting for? "
939,RYAN: I'm not done here yet. 
940,"GRAHAM: Yeah, but, look... I mean, this... You'll be black and blue. "
941,"RYAN: I don't know if you heard about me, but I'm Ryan Sinclair. Me and me mates, we saw off everything from giant spiders to a conscious universe. "
942,"We fought Cybermen, Skithra, Morax, the mighty Pting. It's going to take more than a bike to scare me off. Ain't that right, Grandad? "
943,"GRAHAM: Yeah. Right, then. Well, come on, then. Jump on, then. You all right?  "
944,RYAN: Yeah. 
945,"(The sun is level with the horizon, and they see Grace smiling in the beams.) "
946,GRAHAM: You all right?  
947,"RYAN: Yeah. Yeah, er, just got the sun in me eyes. "
948,"GRAHAM: Yeah, me too. Right, a few more tries and we'll go and save the world, eh? "
949,RYAN: Yeah.  
950,"GRAHAM: Yeah, good. Here we go, get ready. Three, two, one, go! Go on, Ryan. Yeah! Go on, son! You're doing it, mate! "
