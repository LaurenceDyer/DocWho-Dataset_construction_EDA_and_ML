29,(A man signals to a rowing boat offshore with an
30,oil lamp. It comes in and Martha gets out. The boat and its crew
31,leave.) 
32,"MARTHA: What's your name, then? "
33,TOM: Tom Milligan. No need to ask who you are. The famous Martha Jones.
34,How long since you were last in Britain? 
35,MARTHA: Three hundred and sixty five days. It's been a long year. 
36,TOM: So what's the plan? 
37,MARTHA: This Professor Docherty. I need to see her. Can you get me
38,there? 
39,"TOM: She works in a repair shed, Nuclear Plant Seven. I can get you"
40,inside. What's all this for? What's so important about her? 
41,"MARTHA: Sorry, the more you know, the more you're at risk. "
42,TOM: There's a lot of people depending on you. You're a bit of a
43,legend. 
44,MARTHA: What does the legend say? 
45,"TOM: That you sailed the Atlantic, walked across America. That you were"
46,"the only person to get out of Japan alive. Martha Jones, they say,"
47,she's going to save the world. Bit late for that. 
48,(They walk up to a flat bed van.) 
49,MARTHA: How come you can drive? Don't you get stopped? 
50,TOM: Medical staff. Used to be in paediatrics back in the old days. But
51,that gives me a licence to travel so I can help out other the labour
52,camps. 
53,MARTHA: Great. I'm travelling with a doctor.
54,
55,[Van cab]
56,
57,TOM: Story goes that you're the only person on
58,"Earth who can kill him. That you, and you alone, can kill the Master"
59,stone dead. 
60,MARTHA: Let's just drive.
61,
62,[Flight deck]
63,
64,MASTER : Citizens rejoice. Your lord and master
65,"stands on high, playing track three. "
66,(The Master enters the flight deck and starts dancing to I Can't Decide
67,"by Scissor Sisters. He goes up to Lucy, kisses her and they dance"
68,together.) 
69,SINGER: I can't decide whether you should live or die. Though you'll
70,"probably go to Heaven,"
71,please don't hang your head and cry. No wonder why my heart feels dead
72,inside. It's cold and hard and petrified. Lock the doors and close the
73,"blinds, we're going for a ride. Oh, I could throw you in a lake or feed"
74,you poisoned birthday cake. I won't deny I'm
75,going to miss you when you're gone. 
76,(Francine the maid serves tea. The Master rings a ships bell and the
77,Doctor crawls out of his straw-strewn tent. The Master forces him into
78,a wheelchair and takes him for a push around the deck.) 
79,"SINGER: Oh, I could bury you alive but you might crawl out with a knife"
80,"and kill me when I'm sleeping, that's why I can't decide whether you"
81,"should live or die. Oh you'll probably go to Heaven, please don't hang"
82,your head and cry. No wonder why my heart feels dead inside. It's cold
83,"and hard and petrified. Lock the doors and close the blinds, we're"
84,going for a ride. 
85,"MASTER: It's ready to rise, Doctor. The new Time Lord Empire. It's"
86,"good, isn't it? Isn't it good? Anything? No? Anything? Oh, but they"
87,"broke your hearts, didn't they, those Toclafane, ever since you worked"
88,out what they really are. They say Martha Jones has come back home. Now
89,why would she do that? 
90,DOCTOR: Leave her alone. 
91,"MASTER: But you said something to her, didn't you? On the day I took"
92,control. What did you tell her? 
93,DOCTOR: I have one thing to say to you. You know what it is. 
94,"MASTER: Oh no, you don't! "
95,(He pushes the Doctor's wheelchair away.) 
96,TANNOY: Valiant now entering Zone One airspace. Citizens rejoice. 
97,"MASTER: Come on, people! What are we doing? Launch Day in twenty four"
98,hours.
99,(The Doctor holds three fingers against his thigh. Francine repeats the
100,"signal to Clive, who is mopping the deck in a corridor. He passes the"
101,"signal on to Tish, who is also a maid, as she takes a meal to the"
102,prisoner.)
103,
104,[Brig]
105,
106,"(On LD2, grubby, tattered Jack is being forced to"
107,"stand all the time, wrists chained to stout posts on either side.) "
108,"JACK: Morning, Tish. Ah, smell that sea air. Makes me long for good old"
109,British fish and chips. Yeah. What do I get? Cold mashed swede. Some
110,hotel. Last time I book over the Internet. 
111,(Tish spoons him his food and puts three fingers against the container.
112,Jack winks.)
113,
114,[Quarry]
115,
116,(A giant statue of the Master stands above the
117,rocks.) 
118,"MARTHA: All over the Earth, those things. He's even carved himself into"
119,Mount Rushmore. 
120,"TOM: Best to keep down. Here we go. The entire south coast of England,"
121,converted into shipyards. They bring in slave labour every morning.
122,"Break up cars, houses, anything, just for the metal. Building a fleet"
123,out of scrap. 
124,(A fleet of space rockets.) 
125,MARTHA: You should see Russia. That's Shipyard Number One. All the way
126,"from the Black Sea to the Bering Strait, there's a hundred thousand"
127,rockets getting ready for war. 
128,TOM: War? With who? 
129,"MARTHA: The rest of the universe. I've been out there, Tom, in space,"
130,"before all this happened, and there's a thousand different"
131,civilisations all around us with no idea of what's happening here. The
132,Master can build weapons big enough to devastate them all. 
133,TOM: You've been in space? 
134,MARTHA: Problem with that? 
135,"TOM: No. No, just er, wow. Anything else I should know? "
136,MARTHA: I've met Shakespeare. 
137,(Two spheres fly in from behind the statue.) 
138,"SPHERE: Identify, little man. "
139,"TOM: I've got a licence. Thomas Milligan, Peripatetic Medical Squad."
140,I'm allowed to travel. I was just checking for 
141,"SPHERE: Soon the rockets will fly, and everyone will need medicine."
142,You'll be so busy. 
143,"(The spheres fly off to the shipyard, laughing.) "
144,TOM: But they didn't see you. 
145,MARTHA: How do you think I travelled the world? 
146,(She is wearing the Tardis key. They go back to the van.) 
147,"MARTHA: Because the Master set up Archangel, that mobile network,"
148,"fifteen satellites around the planet, but really it's transmitting this"
149,low level psychic field. That's how everyone got hypnotised into
150,thinking he was Harold Saxon. 
151,TOM: Saxon. Feels like years ago. 
152,MARTHA: But the key's tuned in to the same frequency. Makes me sort of
153,"not invisible, just unnoticeable. "
154,"TOM: Well, I can see you. "
155,MARTHA: That's because you wanted to. 
156,"TOM: Yeah, I suppose I did. "
157,MARTHA: Is there a Mrs Milligan? 
158,TOM: No. No. What about you? 
159,MARTHA: There used to be someone. 
160,"(She remembers the Doctor kissing her, then whispering to her.) "
161,"MARTHA: A long time ago. Come on, I've got to find this Docherty woman."
162,
163,TOM: We'll have to wait until the next work shift. What time is it now?
164,
165,MARTHA: It's nearly three o'clock.
166,
167,[Flight deck]
168,
169,(14:58 according to the chronometer up on the
170,"bridge. The Doctor, Francine and Tish are there, whilst Clive is still"
171,"cleaning below decks. Jack can see a clock from his cage, too, and"
172,starts to pull on his chains. The Master enters the flight deck.) 
173,"MASTER: Time for my massage. Who shall I have today? Tanya. Come on,"
174,"sweetheart. Lucy, have you met Tanya? She's gorgeous. Tanya, when we go"
175,"to the stars, I'm going to take you to the Catriga Nova. Whirlpools of"
176,gold. 
177,"(With seconds to go to 3 o'clock, Jack's chains are coming free of the"
178,wall.) 
179,MASTER: You two should get to know each other. That might be fun. 
180,(Tanya massages the Master's shoulders.) 
181,"On the stroke of 3, Jack is free. He grabs a steam hose and points it"
182,at the guard. Clive throws water on an electrical circuit and starts a
183,fire.) 
184,TANNOY: Condition red. 
185,MASTER: What the hell? 
186,"TANNOY: Repeat, condition red. "
187,(Francine throws the Master's jacket to Tish. She gives it to the
188,Doctor who takes the laser screwdriver from the pocket and points it at
189,the Master.) 
190,"MASTER: Oh, I see. "
191,DOCTOR: I told you. I have one thing to say. 
192,(The Master laughs.)
193,
194,[Passageways]
195,
196,(Clive gets caught. Jack is confronted by a squad
197,"of armed men, so he surrenders.) "
198,"JACK: Oh, here we go again. "
199,(The squad shoot Jack.)
200,
201,[Flight deck]
202,
203,(The Doctor can't get the laser screwdriver to
204,work.) 
205,MASTER: Isomorphic controls. 
206,(He takes screwdriver from the Doctor and punches him.) 
207,MASTER: Which means they only work for me. Like this. 
208,(A laser beam just misses Francine.) 
209,MASTER: Say sorry! 
210,FRANCINE: Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. 
211,TISH: Mum! 
212,MASTER: Didn't you learn anything from the blessed Saint Martha? Siding
213,with the Doctor is a very dangerous thing to do. Take them away. 
214,GUARD: Move. Come on. 
215,MASTER: Okay. Gotcha. 
216,(The Master helps the Doctor into a chair as Tish and Francine are
217,taken away.) 
218,"MASTER: Oh boy. There you go, Gramps. Oh, do you know, I remember the"
219,"days when the Doctor, oh, that famous Doctor, was waging a Time War,"
220,battling Sea Devils and Axons. He sealed the rift at the Medusa Cascade
221,single handed. And look at him now. Stealing screwdrivers. How did he
222,"ever come to this? Oh yeah, me. "
223,DOCTOR: I just need you to listen. 
224,"MASTER: No, it's my turn. Revenge! Best served hot. And this time, it's"
225,a message for Miss Jones.
226,
227,[Workshop]
228,
229,"(Tom cuts a gap in the shipyard's chain link fence,"
230,and they run to a building where an older woman is thumping a cathode
231,ray tube in frustration.) 
232,TOM: Professor Docherty? 
233,DOCHERTY: Busy. 
234,"TOM: They, er, they sent word ahead. I'm Tom Milligan. This is Martha"
235,Jones. 
236,DOCHERTY: She can be the Queen of Sheba for all I care. I'm still busy.
237,
238,MARTHA: Televisions don't work anymore. 
239,"DOCHERTY: Oh God, I miss Countdown. Never been the same since Des took"
240,over. Both Deses. What's the plural for Des? Desi? Deseen? But we've
241,been told there's going to be a transmission from the man himself. 
242,(A static-ridden black and white image appears.) 
243,DOCHERTY: There! 
244,"MASTER [on TV]: My people. Salutations on this, the eve of war. Lovely"
245,woman. But I know there's all sorts of whispers down there. Stories of
246,"a child, walking the Earth, giving you hope. "
247,[Flight deck]
248,
249,"(Francine, Clive and Tish are locked up, and Jack"
250,is back in his chains.) 
251,MASTER: But I ask you 
252,[Workshop]
253,
254,MASTER [on TV]: How much hope has this man got? Say
255,"hello, Gandalf. Except he's not that old, but he's an alien with a much"
256,greater lifespan than you stunted little apes. But what if it showed? 
257,[Flight deck]
258,
259,MASTER: What if I suspend your capacity to
260,"regenerate? All nine hundred years of your life, Doctor. What if we"
261,could see them? 
262,(The Master retunes his screwdriver and zaps the Doctor again.) 
263,"MASTER: Older and older and older. Down you go, Doctor. Down, down,"
264,down the years. 
265,(Finally the convulsions end. The Doctor is no longer sitting in the
266,wheelchair.) 
267,MASTER: Doctor. 
268,"(A tiny creature with big eyes, rather Gollum-like, peers out from the"
269,otherwise empty clothes.) 
270,[Workshop]
271,
272,"MASTER [on TV]: Received and understood, Miss"
273,Jones? 
274,(The broadcast ends.) 
275,TOM: I'm sorry. 
276,MARTHA: The Doctor's still alive. 
277,DOCHERTY: Obviously the Archangel Network would seem to be the Master's
278,"greatest weakness. Fifteen satellites all around the Earth, still"
279,transmitting. That's why there's so little resistance. It's
280,broadcasting a telepathic signal that keeps people scared. 
281,TOM: We could just take them out. 
282,DOCHERTY: We could. Fifteen ground to air missiles. You got any on you?
283,"Besides, any military action, the Toclafane descend. "
284,MARTHA: They're not called Toclafane. That's a name the Master made up.
285,
286,"DOCHERTY: Then what are they, then? "
287,MARTHA: That's why I came to find you. Know your enemy. I've got this. 
288,(A computer disc.) 
289,MARTHA: No one's been able to look at a sphere close up. They can't
290,"even be damaged, except once. The lightning strike in South Africa"
291,"brought one of them down, just by chance. I've got the readings on"
292,this. 
293,"(Docherty puts the disc into her computer, and thumps it as it"
294,struggles to read the data.) 
295,"DOCHERTY: Oh, whoever thought we'd miss Bill Gates. "
296,TOM: So is that why you travelled the world? To find a disc? 
297,MARTHA: No. Just got lucky. 
298,DOCHERTY: I heard stories that you walked the Earth to find a way to
299,build a weapon. There! A current of fifty eight point five kiloamperes
300,transferred charge of five hundred and ten megajoules precisely. 
301,TOM: Can you recreate that? 
302,DOCHERTY: I think so. Easily. Yes. 
303,"MARTHA: Right then, Doctor Milligan, we're going to get us a sphere. "
304,(Outside Tom fires a gun three times. A sphere chases him.) 
305,MARTHA: He's coming. You ready? 
306,"DOCHERTY: You do your job, I'll do mine! "
307,(Tom runs in.) 
308,TOM: Now! 
309,(The sphere gets caught in an electrical field set up across a narrow
310,"passageway. After a few moments, it drops to the ground.) "
311,DOCHERTY: That's only half the job. Let's find out what's inside. 
312,[Flight deck]
313,
314,(The tiny Doctor is imprisoned in a bird cage.) 
315,"FRANCINE : I'm going To kill him, if I have to wait a hundred"
316,years. I'm going to kill the Master. 
317,[Brig]
318,
319,(Jack has a gun pointed at him all the time now.) 
320,FRANCINE : One day he'll let his guard down. One day. 
321,[Cell]
322,
323,FRANCINE: And I'll be there. 
324,"CLIVE: No, that's my job. I'll swear to you, I'd shoot that man stone"
325,dead. 
326,TISH: I'll get him. Even if it kills me. 
327,FRANCINE: Don't say that. 
328,TISH: I mean it. That man made us stand on deck and watch the islands
329,"of Japan burning. Millions of people. I swear to you, he's dead."
330,
331,[Flight deck]
332,
333,"(Lucy is still in the glamorous red dress, but"
334,she's not a happy little wife any more.) 
335,"MASTER: Tomorrow, they launch. We're opening up a rift in the"
336,Braccatolian space. They won't see us coming. It kind of scary. 
337,DOCTOR: Then stop. 
338,"MASTER: Once the Empire is established, and there's a new Gallifrey in"
339,"the heavens, maybe then it stops. The drumming. The never ending"
340,drumbeat. Ever since I was a child. I looked into the vortex. That's
341,"when it chose me. The drumming, the call to war. Can't you hear it?"
342,"Listen, it's there now. Right now. Tell me you can hear it, Doctor."
343,Tell me. 
344,DOCTOR: It's only you. 
345,MASTER: Good. 
346,(A sphere enters.) 
347,"FEMALE SPHERE: Tomorrow, the war. Tomorrow we rise, never to fall. "
348,MASTER: You see? I'm doing it for them. You should be grateful. After
349,"all, you love them so very, very much."
350,
351,[Workshop]
352,
353,(Docherty is trying to open the sphere.) 
354,"DOCHERTY: There's some sort of magnetic clamp. Hold on, I'll just trip"
355,the 
356,(The opens the four quarters of the top of the sphere.) 
357,DOCHERTY: Oh my God! 
358,(The sphere contains a tiny wizened head. It opens its eyes and makes
359,them jump back.) 
360,DOCHERTY: It's alive. 
361,SPHERE: Martha. Martha Jones. 
362,TOM: It knows you. 
363,"SPHERE: Sweet, kind Martha Jones. You helped us to fly. "
364,MARTHA: What do you mean? 
365,SPHERE: You led us to salvation. 
366,MARTHA: Who are you? 
367,SPHERE: The skies are made of diamonds. 
368,MARTHA: No. You can't be him. 
369,CREET [memory]: The skies are made of diamonds. 
370,SPHERE: We share each other's memories. You sent him to Utopia. 
371,"MARTHA: Oh, my God. "
372,TOM: What's it talking about? What's it mean? 
373,DOCHERTY: What are they? 
374,"TOM: Martha. Martha, tell us. What are they? "
375,MARTHA: They're us. They're humans. The human race from the future. 
376,[Flight deck]
377,
378,MASTER: I took Lucy to Utopia. A Time Lord and his
379,"human companion. I took her to see the stars. Isn't that right,"
380,sweetheart? 
381,"LUCY: Trillions of years into the future, to the end of the universe. "
382,MASTER: Tell him what you saw. 
383,"LUCY: Dying. Everything dying. The whole of creation was falling apart,"
384,"and I thought, there's no point. No point to anything. Not ever. "
385,MASTER: And it's all your fault. 
386,[Workshop]
387,
388,MARTHA: I'd sort of worked it out with the paradox
389,"machine, because the Doctor said, on the day before the Master came to"
390,"power, he said "
391,"DOCTOR [memory]: When he was stealing the Tardis, the only thing I"
392,could do was fuse the coordinates. I locked them permanently. He can
393,only travel between the year one hundred trillion and the last place
394,"the Tardis landed, Which is right here, right now. "
395,"MARTHA: The Master had the Tardis, this time machine, but the only"
396,"other place he could go was the end of the universe, so he found"
397,Utopia. 
398,[Flight deck]
399,
400,"MASTER: You should have seen it, Doctor. Furnaces"
401,burning. The last of humanity screaming at the dark.
402,
403,[Workshop]
404,
405,MARTHA: The Utopia Project was the last hope.
406,Trying to find a way to escape the end of everything. 
407,"SPHERE: There was no solution, no diamonds. Just the dark and the cold."
408,
409,[Flight deck]
410,
411,MASTER: All that human invention that had sustained
412,them across the eons. It all turned inwards. They cannibalised
413,themselves. 
414,FEMALE SPHERE: We made ourselves so pretty. 
415,MASTER: Regressing into children. But it didn't work. The universe was
416,collapsing around them.
417,
418,[Workshop]
419,
420,SPHERE: But then the Master came with his wonderful
421,time machine to bring us back home. 
422,"DOCHERTY: But that's a paradox. If you're the future of the human race,"
423,"and you've come back to murder your ancestors, you should cancel"
424,yourselves out. You shouldn't exist. 
425,MARTHA: And that's the paradox machine.
426,
427,[Flight deck]
428,
429,"MASTER: My masterpiece, Doctor. A living Tardis,"
430,"strong enough to hold the paradox in place, allowing the past and the"
431,future to collide in infinite majesty. 
432,"DOCTOR: But you're changing history. Not just Earth, the entire"
433,universe. 
434,MASTER: I'm a Time Lord. I have that right. 
435,"DOCTOR: But even then, why come all this way just to destroy? "
436,FEMALE SPHERE: We come backwards in time all to build a brand new
437,empire lasting one hundred trillion years. 
438,MASTER: With me as their master. Time Lord and humans combined. Haven't
439,"you always dreamt of that, Doctor?"
440,
441,[Workshop]
442,
443,TOM: But what about us? We're the same species. Why
444,do you kill so many of us? 
445,SPHERE: Because it's fun! 
446,(Tom shoots the head.)
447,
448,[Flight deck]
449,
450,"MASTER: Human race, greatest monsters of them all."
451,"Night, then. "
452,"(The Master and Lucy leave, and the sphere follows.)"
453,
454,[Docherty's room]
455,
456,"DOCHERTY: I think it's time we had the truth, Miss"
457,Jones. The legend says you've travelled the world to find a way of
458,"killing the Master. Tell us, is it true? "
459,"MARTHA: Just before I escaped, the Doctor told me. The Doctor and the"
460,"Master, they've been coming to Earth for years. And they've been"
461,"watched. There's UNIT and Torchwood, all studying Time Lords in secret."
462,"And they made this, the ultimate defence. "
463,"(Martha opens the case to reveal a gun-like device, with a squeeze"
464,trigger and four small cylinders along the top. She also has three
465,vials of coloured liquid.) 
466,TOM: All you need to do is get close. I can shoot the Master dead with
467,this. 
468,"DOCHERTY: Actually, you can put that down now, thank you very much. "
469,"MARTHA: Point is, it's not so easy to kill a Time Lord. They can"
470,regenerate. Literally bring themselves back to life. 
471,"DOCHERTY: Ah, the Master's immortal. Wonderful. "
472,"MARTHA: Except for this. Four chemicals, slotted into the gun. Inject"
473,him. Kills a Time Lord permanently. 
474,TOM: Four chemicals? You've only got three. 
475,"MARTHA: Still need the last one, because the components of this gun"
476,"were kept safe, scattered across the world, and I found them. San"
477,"Diego, Beijing, Budapest and London. "
478,TOM: Then where is it? 
479,"MARTHA: There's an old UNIT base, north London. I've found the access"
480,"codes. Tom, you've got to get me there. "
481,[Workshop]
482,
483,TOM: We can't get across London in the dark. It's
484,"full of wild dogs. We'll get eaten alive. We can wait till the morning,"
485,then go with the medical convoy. 
486,"DOCHERTY: You can spend the night here, if you like. "
487,"TOM: No, we can get halfway, stay at the slave quarters in Bexley."
488,"Professor, thank you. "
489,DOCHERTY: And you. Good luck. 
490,MARTHA: Thanks. 
491,"DOCHERTY: Martha, could you do it? Could you actually kill him? "
492,MARTHA: I've got no choice. 
493,"DOCHERTY: You might be many things, but you don't look like a killer to"
494,me.

496,[Outside the slave quarters]
497,
498,"(Tom and Martha dodge a patrol, and knock on a"
499,door.) 
500,TOM: Let me in. It's Milligan. 
501,[Slave quarters]
502,
503,(The place is full to bursting.) 
504,WOMAN: Did you bring food? 
505,"TOM: Couldn't get any, and I'm starving. "
506,WOMAN: All we've got is water. 
507,MARTHA: I'm sorry. 
508,"TOM: It's cheaper than building barracks. Pack them in, a hundred in"
509,"each house, ferry them off to the shipyards every morning. "
510,BOY: Are you Martha Jones? 
511,"MARTHA: Yeah, that's me. "
512,BOY: Can you do it? Can you kill him? They said you can kill the
513,"Master, can you? Tell us you can do it. Please, tell us you can do it. "
514,WOMAN: Who is the Master? 
515,(A babble of voices.) 
516,"TOM: Come on, just leave her alone. She's exhausted. "
517,"MARTHA: No, it's all right. They want me to talk, and I will."

519,[Workshop]
520,
521,(Docherty opens a High Voltage box to reveal an
522,Archangel communications device.) 
523,DOCHERTY: Access Priority One. This is Professor Alison Docherty. 
524,COMPUTER: State your intent. 
525,"DOCHERTY: First of all, I need to know about my son. "
526,COMPUTER: State your intent. 
527,DOCHERTY: Is my son still alive? 
528,COMPUTER: State your intent. 
529,DOCHERTY: I have some information for the Master concerning Martha
530,Jones.
531,
532,[Flight deck]
533,
534,(The Master enters in a silk dressing gown and
535,wakes up the Doctor.) 
536,MASTER: Guess what.
537,
538,[Slave quarters]
539,
540,"MARTHA: I travelled across the world, from the"
541,"ruins of New York to the fusion mills of China, right across the"
542,"radiation pits of Europe. And everywhere I went, I saw people just like"
543,"you, living as slaves. But if Martha Jones became a legend, then that's"
544,"wrong, because my name isn't important. There's someone else. The man"
545,who sent me out there. The man who told me to walk the Earth. And his
546,"name is the Doctor. He has saved your lives so many times, and you"
547,never even knew he was there. He never stops. He never stays. He never
548,asks to be thanked. But I've seen him. I know him. I love him. And I
549,know what he can do. 
550,"WOMAN: It's him! It's him! Oh my God, it's him! It's the Master. He's"
551,here. 
552,BOY: But he never comes to Earth. He never walks upon the ground. 
553,WOMAN: Hide her! 
554,TOM: Use this. 
555,"(They cover Martha with an old sack. Outside, the Master is accompanied"
556,by armed guards and spheres. Tom readies his gun by the letter box.) 
557,"BOY: He walks among us, our lord and master. "
558,[Outside the slave quarters]
559,
560,MASTER: Martha. Martha Jones. I can see you! Out
561,"you come, little girl. Come and meet your master. Anybody? Nobody? No?"
562,Nothing? Positions. I'll give the order unless you surrender. Ask
563,yourself. What would the Doctor do?
564,(Martha takes off the Tardis key and goes outside.) 
565,"MASTER: Oh, yes. Oh, very well done. Good girl. He trained you well."
566,"Bag. Give me the bag. No, stay there. Just throw it. "
567,"(Martha throws her backpack towards the Master, who fires his laser"
568,screwdriver at it.) 
569,"MASTER: And now, good companion, your work is done. "
570,(The Master points his laser at Martha. Tom runs out of the house.) 
571,TOM: No! 
572,"(The Master kills Tom, and laughs.) "
573,"MASTER: But you, when you die, the Doctor should be witness, hmm?"
574,"Almost dawn, Martha, and planet Earth marches to war."

582,"MASTER: Your teleport device, in case you thought I'd forgotten. "
583,(Martha throws the vortex manipulator to the Master.) 
584,"MASTER: And now, kneel. Down below, the fleet is ready to launch. Two"
585,hundred thousand ships set to burn across the universe. Are we ready? 
586,MAN : The fleet awaits your signal. Rejoice! 
587,MASTER: Three minutes to align the black hole converters. Counting
588,"down. I never could resist a ticking clock. My children, are you ready?"
589,
590,SPHERES [in orbit]: We will fly and blaze and slice. We will fly and
591,blaze and slice.
592,"MASTER: At zero, to mark this day, the child Martha Jones, will die. My"
593,"first blood. Any last words? No? Such a disappointment, this one. Days"
594,"of old, Doctor, you had companions who could absorb the time vortex."
595,"This one's useless. Bow your head. And so it falls to me, as Master of"
596,"all, to establish from this day, a new order of Time Lords. From this"
597,day forward 
598,(Martha laughs quietly.) 
599,MASTER: What. What's so funny? 
600,MARTHA: A gun. 
601,MASTER: What about it? 
602,MARTHA: A gun in four parts? 
603,"MASTER: Yes, and I destroyed it. "
604,"MARTHA: A gun in four parts scattered across the world? I mean, come"
605,"on, did you really believe that? "
606,MASTER: What do you mean? 
607,DOCTOR: As if I would ask her to kill. 
608,"MASTER: Oh well, it doesn't matter. I've got her exactly where I want"
609,her. 
610,MARTHA: But I knew what Professor Docherty would do. The Resistance
611,knew about her son. 
612,MARTHA [memory]: That's why I came to find you. Know your enemy. 
613,"MARTHA: I told her about the gun, so she'd get me here at the right"
614,time. 
615,"MASTER: Oh, but you're still going to die. "
616,"MARTHA: Don't you want to know what I was doing, travelling the world? "
617,MASTER: Tell me. 
618,"MARTHA: I told a story, that's all. No weapons, just words. I did just"
619,what the Doctor said. I went across the continents all on my own. And
620,"everywhere I went, I found the people, and I told them my story. "
621,"MARTHA [in slave quarters]: He has saved your lives so many times, and"
622,you never even knew he was there. I know him. 
623,MARTHA: I told them about the Doctor. 
624,MARTHA [in slave quarters]: I love him. 
625,"MARTHA: And I told them to pass it on, to spread the word so that"
626,everyone would know about the Doctor. 
627,MASTER: Faith and hope? Is that all? 
628,"MARTHA: No, because I gave them an instruction, just as the Doctor"
629,said. 
630,(Martha stands up.) 
631,DOCTOR [memory]: Use the countdown. 
632,"MARTHA: I told them that if everyone thinks of one word, at one"
633,specific time 
634,MASTER: Nothing will happen. Is that your weapon? Prayer? 
635,"MARTHA: Right across the world, in word, just one thought at one moment"
636,but with fifteen satellites. 
637,MASTER: What? 
638,JACK: The Archangel Network. 
639,"MARTHA: A telepathic field binding the whole human race together, with"
640,"all of them, every single person on Earth, thinking the same thing at"
641,the same time. And that word is Doctor. 
642,(Zero. The Doctor and his cage starts to glow.) 
643,"MASTER: Stop it. No, no, no, no, you don't. "
644,JACK: Doctor. Doctor. 
645,FRANCINE: Doctor. 
646,MASTER: Don't. 
647,CROWD : Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. 
648,MASTER: Stop this right now. Stop it! 
649,LUCY: Doctor. 
650,JACK: Doctor. 
651,MARTHA: Doctor. 
652,CROWD : Doctor. 
653,(The Doctor is back to his previous centegenarian form.) 
654,DOCTOR: I've had a whole year to tune myself into the psychic network
655,and integrate with its matrices. 
656,MASTER: I order you to stop! 
657,CROWDS: Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. 
658,LUCY: Doctor. 
659,DOCTOR: The one thing you can't do. Stop them thinking. 
660,(The Doctor is back to his normal appearance.) 
661,"DOCTOR: Tell me the human race is degenerate now, when they can do"
662,this. 
663,(Martha runs to Francine and Tish for a group hug.) 
664,MASTER: No! 
665,"(He fires laser screwdriver at the Doctor, but the energy field is"
666,still around him and it doesn't get through.) 
667,DOCTOR: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
668,MASTER: Then I'll kill them. 
669,(The Doctor stretches out his hand and the screwdriver flies from the
670,Master's hand.) 
671,MASTER: You can't do this. You can't do it. It's not fair! 
672,DOCTOR: And you know what happens now. 
673,MASTER: No! No! No! No! 
674,(The Doctor floats towards the Master.) 
675,DOCTOR: You wouldn't listen. 
676,MASTER: No! 
677,DOCTOR: Because you know what I'm going to say. 
678,MASTER: No. 
679,(The Master curls into a ball in the corner. The Doctor puts his arms
680,around him.) 
681,DOCTOR: I forgive you. 
682,MASTER: My children. 
683,SPHERES [in orbit]: Protect the paradox. Protect the paradox. Protect
684,the paradox. 
685,"DOCTOR: Captain, the paradox machine! "
686,"JACK: You men, with me! You stay here. "
687,"(The Doctor spots the Master activating the manipulator, and grabs it.)"
688,
689,DOCTOR: No! 
690,[Quarry]
691,
692,"MASTER: Now it ends, Doctor. Now it ends. "
693,"(A roll of thunder, and sirens sound in the shipyard.)"
694,
695,[Flight deck]

697,MARTHA: We've all six billion spheres heading right
698,for us.
699,
700,[Quarry]
701,
702,DOCTOR: We've got control of the Valiant. You can't
703,launch. 
704,"MASTER: Oh, but I've got this. Black hole converter inside every ship."
705,"If I can't have this world, Doctor, then neither can you. We shall"
706,"stand upon this Earth together, as it burns. "
707,[Valiant]
708,
709,(Jack and the guards find three spheres are
710,"guarding the Tardis, so they start shooting at them. The rest are"
711,hurtling back down towards the Valiant.)
712,GUARD: Can't get in. We'd get slaughtered. 
713,JACK: Yeah. Happens to me a lot. 
714,(Jack goes in alone.)
715,
716,[Quarry]
717,
718,DOCTOR: Weapon after weapon after weapon. All you
719,do is talk and talk and talk. But over all these years and all these
720,"disasters, I've always had the greatest secret of them all. I know you."
721,"Explode those ships, you kill yourself. That's the one thing you can"
722,never do. Give that to me. 
723,(The Master hands over the black hole converter trigger. Jack gets
724,inside the Tardis and empties his machine gun clip at the paradox
725,machine. It goes Bang. 
726,"At the quarry, the ground shakes as the Doctor and the Master struggle"
727,for the vortex manipulator. They disappear together.)

732,are flying everywhere. Martha gets thrown into the Doctor's arms.) 
733,DOCTOR: Everyone get down! Time is reversing! 
734,(The Master is hanging onto some railings. Francine sees a pistol on
735,"the floor. Meanwhile, the winds of time are creating havoc and panic on"
736,"the ground, until finally the people, the rockets and the statues"
737,disappear. Calm returns and a red bus drives around Piccadilly Circus.)
738,
739,"DOCTOR: The paradox is broken. We've reverted back, one year and one"
740,day. Two minutes past eight in the morning. 
741,MAN : This is UNIT Central. What's happened up there? We just saw
742,the President assassinated. 
743,"DOCTOR: Just after the President was killed, but just before the"
744,spheres arrived. Everything back to normal. Planet Earth restored. None
745,"of it happened. The rockets, the terror. It never was. "
746,MARTHA: What about the spheres? 
747,DOCTOR: Trapped at the end of the universe. 
748,FRANCINE: But I can remember it. 
749,DOCTOR: We're at the eye of the storm. The only ones who'll ever know.
750,"Oh, hello. You must be Mister Jones. We haven't actually met. "
751,(The Master runs for the door just as Jack is coming in.) 
752,"JACK: Whoa, big fella! You don't want to miss the party. Cuffs. So,"
753,what do we do with this one? 
754,CLIVE: We kill him. 
755,TISH: We execute him. 
756,"DOCTOR: No, that's not the solution. "
757,(Francine aims the pistol at the Master.) 
758,"FRANCINE: Oh, I think so. Because all those things, they still happened"
759,because of him. I saw them. 
760,MASTER: Go on. Do it. 
761,"DOCTOR: Francine, you're better than him. "
762,"(The Doctor gets Francine to lower the gun and he hugs her, then hands"
763,her off to Martha.) 
764,MASTER: You still haven't answered the question. What happens to me? 
765,DOCTOR: You're my responsibility from now on. The only Time Lord left
766,in existence. 
767,"JACK: Yeah, but you can't trust him. "
768,DOCTOR: No. The only safe place for him is the Tardis. 
769,MASTER: You mean you're just going to keep me? 
770,DOCTOR: Mmm. If that's what I have to do. It's time to change. Maybe
771,I've been wandering for too long. Now I've got someone to care for. 
772,(Lucy shoots the Master. The Doctor catches him as he staggers back.) 
773,JACK: Put it down. 
774,DOCTOR: There you go. I've got you. I've got you. 
775,MASTER: Always the women. 
776,DOCTOR: I didn't see her. 
777,MASTER: Dying in your arms. Happy now? 
778,DOCTOR: You're not dying. Don't be stupid. It's only a bullet. Just
779,regenerate. 
780,MASTER: No. 
781,DOCTOR: One little bullet. Come on. 
782,MASTER: I guess you don't know me so well. I refuse. 
783,DOCTOR: Regenerate. Just regenerate. Please. Please! Just regenerate.
784,Come on. 
785,MASTER: And spend the rest of my life imprisoned with you? 
786,"DOCTOR: You've got to. Come on. It can't end like this. You and me, all"
787,the things we've done. Axons. Remember the Axons? And the Daleks. We're
788,the only two left. There's no one else. Regenerate! 
789,"MASTER: How about that. I win. Will it stop, Doctor? The drumming. Will"
790,it stop? 
791,(The Master dies.) 
792,DOCTOR: No! 
793,"(Somewhere, later, the Doctor lights the Master's funeral pyre then"
794,walks away.)

798,(Alison Docherty is walking along a path when
799,Martha runs up to her and give her a bunch of flowers.) 
800,"MARTHA: Just to say, I don't blame you. "
801,DOCHERTY: But who are you?
802,
803,[Roald Dahl Plass]
804,
805,"MARTHA: Time was, every single one of these people"
806,knew your name. Now they've all forgotten you. 
807,DOCTOR: Good. 
808,JACK: Back to work. 
809,"DOCTOR: I really don't mind, though. Come with me. "
810,"JACK: I had plenty of time to think that past year, the year that never"
811,"was, and I kept thinking about that team of mine. Like you said,"
812,"Doctor, responsibility. "
813,DOCTOR: Defending the Earth. Can't argue with that. 
814,(The Doctor takes Jack's hand and exposes the vortex manipulator on his
815,wrist.) 
816,"JACK: Hey, I need that. "
817,DOCTOR: I can't have you walking around with a time travelling
818,"teleport. You could go anywhere, twice. The second time to apologise. "
819,(The Doctor sonics the manipulator.) 
820,JACK: And what about me? Can you fix that? Will I ever be able to die? 
821,"DOCTOR: Nothing I can do. You're an impossible thing, Jack. "
822,JACK: Been called that before. Sir. Ma'am. But I keep wondering. What
823,about aging? Because I can't die but I keep getting older. The odd
824,"little grey hair, you know? What happens if I live for a million years?"
825,
826,DOCTOR: I really don't know. 
827,"JACK: Okay, vanity. Sorry. Yeah, can't help it. Used to be a poster boy"
828,when I was a kid living on the Boeshane
829,Peninsula. Tiny little place. I was the first one ever to be signed up
830,"for the Time Agency. They were so proud of me. The Face of Boe, they"
831,called me. Hmm. I'll see you. 
832,(Jack head off towards Torchwood's secret entrance.) 
833,DOCTOR: No. 
834,MARTHA: It can't be. 
835,DOCTOR: No. Definitely not. No. No.

837,
838,"(The Doctor watches Francine, Martha, Clive and"
839,Tish inside the house from across the
840,"street where the Tardis is parked, then goes inside it. His spare hand"
841,"is now attached to the base of the console. A little later, Martha"
842,"leaves the house, making a telephone call.) "
843,"MARTHA: Yeah. Could you put me through? Hi, I'm looking for a Doctor"

855,(Martha hangs up.)
856,
857,[Tardis]
858,
859,"DOCTOR: Right then, off we go. The open road. There"
860,"is a burst of starfire right now over the coast of Meta Sigmafolio. Oh,"
861,"the sky is like oil on water. Fancy a look? Or back in time. We could,"
862,"I don't know, Charles the Second? Henry the Eighth. I know. What about"
863,Agatha Christie? I'd love to meet Agatha Christie. I bet she's
864,brilliant. Okay. 
865,MARTHA: I just can't. 
866,DOCTOR: Yeah. 
867,MARTHA: Spent all these years training to be a doctor. Now I've got
868,people to look after. They saw half the planet slaughtered and they're
869,devastated. I can't leave them. 
870,"DOCTOR: Of course not. Thank you. Martha Jones, you saved the world. "
871,"MARTHA: Yes, I did. I spent a lot of time with you thinking I was"
872,"second best, but you know what? I am good. You"
873,going to be all right? 
874,DOCTOR: Always. Yeah. 
875,MARTHA: Right then. Bye. 
876,"(Martha leaves, then goes back inside.) "
877,"MARTHA: Because the thing is, it's like my friend Vicky. She lived with"
878,"this bloke, student housing, there were five of them all packed in, and"
879,this bloke was called Sean. And she loved him. She did. She completely
880,adored him. Spent all day long talking about him. 
881,DOCTOR: Is this going anywhere? 
882,"MARTHA: Yes. Because he never looked at her twice. I mean, he liked"
883,"her, but that was it. And she wasted years pining after him. Years of"
884,"her life. Because while he was around, she never looked at anyone else."
885,"And I told her, I always said to her, time and time again, I said, get"
886,"out. So this is me, getting out. "
887,(She throws her mobile phone to him.) 
888,"MARTHA: Keep that, because I'm not having you disappear. If that rings,"
889,"when that rings, you'd better come running. Got it? "
890,DOCTOR: Got it. 
891,"MARTHA: I'll see you again, mister. "
892,(Martha leaves and the Tardis dematerialises. 
893,The Master's pyre has burnt out. A hand with red fingernails takes his
894,signet ring from the ashes. 
895,"Suddenly there is the sound of a ship's foghorn, and the bow of a ship"
896,smashes through the side of the Tardis.)
