22,(Three months later - July 1969. 
23,Amy is running for her life from men in a four wheel drive.) 
24,CANTON: Suspect directly ahead. Coming to you now. Over. 
25,(Another vehicle is coming from the opposite direction. They trap her
26,by a cliff.) 
27,AMY: Canton. 
28,CANTON: Miss Pond. 
29,AMY: Is that a body bag? 
30,"CANTON: Yes, it is. "
31,AMY: It's empty. 
32,CANTON: How about that? 
33,"AMY: Do you even know why you're doing this, eh? Can you even remember"
34,the warehouse? 
35,[Warehouse memory]
36,
37,(The Doctor is dragging Canton away.) 
38,DOCTOR: Canton. Amy. Amy! 
39,"RORY: River, come on! "
40,DOCTOR: Run! 
41,CANTON: What the hell's going on? 
42,DOCTOR: Look behind you. 
43,CANTON: There's nothing behind me. 
44,"DOCTOR: Look. Look. Canton, look, I tell you. "
45,(Canton turns around.) 
46,SILENCE: Canton. 
47,(Canton shoots Amy in Utah. She has tally marks on her arms.)

49,"[Area 51, Nevada]"
50,
51,"(The Doctor is in a strait-jacket, shackles to a"
52,chair with a yellow circle around it. He is surrounded by guards and
53,notices saying Do Not Approach The Prisoner and Do Not Interact With
54,"The Prisoner, and has grown a beard.) "
55,TANNOY: All visitors to remain behind the yellow line. All visitors to
56,remain behind the yellow line.Â 
57,CANTON: We found Amy Pond. She had strange markings on her arm. Do you
58,know what they are? 
59,DOCTOR: Why don't you ask her?
60,
61,[New York]
62,
63,"(River has tally marks on her arms, too. She is"
64,wearing evening dress and running through a skyscraper under
65,construction.) 
66,RIVER: I see you. I see you. 
67,(She tallies two more Silence on her arm.) 
68,CANTON: Doctor Song? Doctor Song? Go! Go! Go! 
69,(They catch up with her at an open wall.) 
70,CANTON: Don't move! It's over. 
71,"RIVER: They're here, Canton. They're everywhere. "
72,CANTON: I know. America's being invaded. 
73,RIVER: You were invaded a long time ago. America is occupied. 
74,"CANTON: You're coming with us, Doctor Song. There's no way out this"
75,time. 
76,RIVER: There's always a way out. 
77,(River gently falls backwards out of the skyscraper.
78,
79,[Area 51]
80,
81,(A wall is being constructed around the Doctor.) 
82,CANTON: We found Doctor Song. 
83,"DOCTOR: These bricks, what are they made of? Where is she? "
84,CANTON: She ran. Off the fiftieth floor. 
85,DOCTOR: I'd say zero balance dwarf star alloy. The densest material in
86,the universe. Nothing gets through that. You're building me the perfect
87,prison. And it still won't be enough. 
88,[Glen Canyon Dam - Arizona]
89,
90,(A very dishevelled Rory with lots of tally marks
91,"on his skin runs out onto the top of the dam, only to find lots of men"
92,"with guns waiting for him, and it's a long way down.) "
93,RORY: What are you waiting for? 
94,CANTON: I'm waiting for you to run. It'd look better if I shot you
95,"while you're running. Then again, looks aren't everything. "
96,(Canton shoots Rory.) 
97,[Cell]
98,
99,(Body bags are dragged in to the completed dwarf
100,star alloy cell.) 
101,DOCTOR: Is there a reason you're doing this? 
102,CANTON: I want you to know where you stand. 
103,DOCTOR: In a cell. 
104,CANTON: In the perfect cell. Nothing can penetrate these walls. Not a
105,"sound, not a radio wave, not the tiniest particle of anything. "
106,(Canton closes the door when the soldiers leave. It vanishes. There is
107,a palm print panel near where it should be.) 
108,"CANTON: In here, you're literally cut off from the rest of the"
109,"universe. So I guess they can't hear us, right? "
110,"DOCTOR: Good work, Canton. Door sealed? "
111,CANTON: You bet. 
112,(The Doctor shakes off his shackles and strait-jacket. The body bags
113,"sit up, gasping for breath.) "
114,DOCTOR: Are you okay? 
115,AMY: Finally. 
116,RORY: These things could really do with air holes. 
117,CANTON: Never had a complaint before. 
118,AMY: Isn't it going to look odd that you're staying in here with us? 
119,"CANTON: Odd, but not alarming. They know there's no way out of this"
120,place. 
121,"DOCTOR: Exactly. Whatever they might think we're doing in here, they"
122,know we're not going anywhere. 
123,"(The Doctor slumps to his right, and leans against the Tardis. He snaps"
124,his fingers to open the door.) 
125,DOCTOR: Shall we? 
126,CANTON: What about Doctor Song?
127,
128,[Tardis]
129,
130,CANTON: She dove off a rooftop. 
131,"DOCTOR: Don't worry. She does that. Amy, Rory, open all the doors to"
132,the swimming pool. 
133,"(River turns into a dive, and plummets through the Tardis' open door"
134,where it is parked on the side of the skyscraper. There is a big
135,Splosh!) 
136,"DOCTOR: So, we know they're everywhere. Not just a landing party, an"
137,"occupying force, and they 'have been here a very, very long time. But"
138,"nobody knows that, because no one can remember them. "
139,CANTON: So what are they up to? 
140,"DOCTOR: No idea. But the good news is, we've got a secret weapon."
141,
142,[Kennedy Space Centre]
143,
144,(A Saturn V rocket is on the launch pad nearby.) 
145,RIVER: Apollo 11's your secret weapon? 
146,"DOCTOR: No, no. It's not Apollo 11. That would be silly. It's Neil"
147,Armstrong's foot.
148,
149,[Car]
150,
151,(It is a dark and stormy night when a car drives up
152,to the Graystark Hall Orphanage.) 
153,"RADIO : In just a few days, mankind will set foot on the Moon for"
154,"the first time. Today, the President reaffirmed America's commitment "
155,CANTON: Ready. Check. 
156,(Amy looks at her palm. No tally marks.) 
157,AMY: Clear. 
158,(Canton looks at his palm.) 
159,CANTON: Clear.
160,
161,[Tardis]
162,
163,"(Earlier, the Doctor has injected something into"
164,Canton's palm.) 
165,CANTON: Ow! 
166,"DOCTOR: Ha. So, three months. What have we found out? "
167,"RORY: Well, they are everywhere. Every state in America. Ahh. "
168,(Rory got his injection.) 
169,"DOCTOR: Not just America, the entire world. "
170,"RIVER: There's a greater concentration here, though. "
171,AMY: Ow! 
172,DOCTOR: Are you okay? 
173,AMY: All better. 
174,DOCTOR: Better? 
175,AMY: Turns out I was wrong. I'm not pregnant. 
176,RORY: What's up? 
177,"AMY: Nothing. Really, nothing. Seriously. "
178,"CANTON: So you've seen them, but you don't remember them. "
179,"RIVER: You've seen them, too. That night at the warehouse, remember?"
180,"While you were pretending to hunt us down, we saw hundreds of those"
181,things. We still don't know what they look like. 
182,RORY: It's like they edit themselves out of your memory as soon as you
183,"look away. The exact second you're not looking at them, you can't"
184,remember anything. 
185,"AMY: Sometimes you feel a bit sick, though, but not always. "
186,CANTON: So that's why you marked your skin. 
187,AMY: Only way we'd know if we'd had an encounter. 
188,CANTON: How long have they been here? 
189,AMY: That's what we've spent the last three months trying to find out. 
190,"RORY: Not easy, if you can't remember anything you discover. "
191,CANTON: How long do you think? 
192,"DOCTOR: As long as there's been something in the corner of your eye, or"
193,"creaking in your house, or breathing under your bed, or voices through"
194,"a wall. They've been running your lives for a very long time now, so"
195,"keep this straight in your head. We are not fighting an alien invasion,"
196,"we're leading a revolution. And today, the battle begins. "
197,CANTON: How? 
198,DOCTOR: Like this. 
199,(The Doctor quickly injects River.) 
200,RIVER: Ow! 
201,DOCTOR: (laughs) Nanorecorder. Fuses with the cartilage in your hand.
202,(injects himself) Ow. And it tunes itself directly to the speech
203,"centres in your brain. It'll pick up your voice, no matter what."
204,"Telepathic connection. So, the moment you see one of the creatures, you"
205,"activate it, and describe aloud exactly what you're seeing. "
206,DOCTOR: : And describe aloud exactly what you're seeing. 
207,"DOCTOR: Because the moment you break contact, you're going to forget it"
208,happened. The light will flash if you've left yourself a message. You
209,keep checking your hand if you've had an encounter. That's the first
210,you'll know about it. 
211,CANTON: Why didn't you tell me this before we started? 
212,"DOCTOR: I did, but even information about these creatures erases itself"
213,over time. I couldn't refresh it because I couldn't talk to you. 
214,(Canton looks away then turns back and adjusts the Doctor's bow tie.) 
215,CANTON: What? What are you staring at? 
216,RIVER: Look at your hand. 
217,(A little dot is flashing.) 
218,CANTON: Why is it doing that? 
219,DOCTOR: What does it mean if the light's flashing? What did I just tell
220,you? 
221,CANTON: I haven't 
222,DOCTOR: Play it. 
223,"CANTON : My God, how did it get in here? "
224,"DOCTOR : Keep eye contact with the creature and, when I say, turn"
225,"back, and when you do, straighten my bow tie. "
226,CANTON : What? What are you staring at? 
227,RIVER : Look at your hand. 
228,(One of the aliens is standing there.) 
229,"DOCTOR: It's a hologram, extrapolated from the photo on Amy's phone."
230,"Take a good, long look. "
231,(The Doctor turns off the image.) 
232,DOCTOR: You just saw an image of one of the creatures we're fighting.
233,Describe it to me. 
234,CANTON: I can't. 
235,DOCTOR: No. Neither can I. You straightened my bow tie because I
236,planted the idea in your head while you were looking at the creature. 
237,AMY: So they could do that to people. You could be doing stuff and not
238,really knowing why you're doing it. 
239,RORY: Like posthypnotic suggestion. 
240,AMY: Ruling the world with posthypnotic suggestion? 
241,"DOCTOR: Now then, a little girl in a spacesuit. They got the suit from"
242,"NASA, but where did they get the girl? "
243,CANTON: It could be anywhere. 
244,"DOCTOR: Except they'd probably stay close to that warehouse, because"
245,why bother doing anything else? And they'd take her from somewhere that
246,would cause the least amount of attention. But you'll have to find her.
247,I'm off to NASA. 
248,CANTON: Find her? Where do we look? 
249,DOCTOR: Children's homes.
250,
251,[Greystark Hall Orphanage]
252,
253,RENFREW: Hello? 
254,CANTON: FBI. You must be Doctor Renfrew. Can we come in? 
255,RENFREW: The children are asleep. 
256,AMY: We'll be very quiet. 
257,RENFREW: Is there a problem? 
258,CANTON: It's about a missing child. 
259,"RENFREW: What are you. Yes, come in, please. This way. Please excuse"
260,the writing. It keeps happening. I try to clean it up. 
261,(On the wall up the staircase are the words Get Out Leave Now in large
262,red letters.) 
263,"AMY: It's the kids, yeah? They did that. "
264,"RENFREW: Yes, the children. It must be, yes. Anyway, my office is this"
265,way. 
266,CANTON: We nearly didn't come to this place. I understood Graystark
267,Hall was closed in 67. 
268,"RENFREW: That's the plan, yes. "
269,AMY: The plan? 
270,RENFREW: Not long now. 
271,CANTON: It's 1969. 
272,"RENFREW: No, no. We close in 67. That's the plan, yes. "
273,"CANTON: You misunderstood me, sir. It's 1969 now. "
274,RENFREW: Why are you saying that? Of course it isn't. 
275,CANTON: July. 
276,RENFREW: My office is this way. This way. 
277,AMY: I'll check upstairs. 
278,CANTON: Be careful. 
279,"(The first dormitory is derelict and deserted, with the walls"
280,graffitied with Leave Me Alone and Get Out Now.)
281,
282,[Apollo 11]
283,
284,DOCTOR: Amy. 
285,[Dormitory]
286,
287,AMY: I think we've found the place she was taken
288,from.
289,
290,[Apollo 11]
291,
292,DOCTOR: How do you know? 
293,AMY: Because those things have been here. But the whole place is
294,deserted.
295,
296,[Dormitory]
297,
298,AMY: There's just one guy here and I think he's
299,lost it.
300,
301,[Apollo 11]
302,
303,DOCTOR: Repeated memory wipes fry your head
304,"eventually. Find out what you can, but don't hang around."
305,
306,[Dormitory]
307,
308,AMY: Where are you?
309,
310,[Apollo 11]
311,
312,DOCTOR: Got to go. Got company. 
313,(He closes the panel he has been working on.) 
314,"DOCTOR: Don't worry, I've put everything back the way I found it."
315,"Except this. There's always a bit left over, isn't there? "
316,(The scientists are not amused. The Doctor's gizmo quietly beeps to
317,itself inside the module.)
318,
319,[Dormitory]
320,
321,(The door slams shut behind Amy. She tried to open
322,it then sees the blinking light in her palm.) 
323,"AMY : I can see them, but I think they're asleep. Get out. Just get"
324,out! 
325,"She tries the windows then sees the tally marks on her hands, and then"
326,the lightning shows her reflection in the glass. There are tally marks
327,"on her face, too. The aliens are hanging from the ceiling in a cluster,"
328,like bats. She bumps into a bucket and they start to wake. Then the
329,door opens and she forgets it all.)
330,
331,[Lecture hall]
332,
333,(Diagrams of the command module and the lander on
334,the blackboards.) 
335,"GARDNER: Now, one more time, sir. How the hell did you get into the"
336,command module? 
337,DOCTOR: I told you. I'm on a top secret mission for the President. 
338,"GARDNER: Well, maybe if you just get President Nixon to assure us of"
339,"that, sir, that would be swell. "
340,DOCTOR: I sent him a message. 
341,"(The President enters, with River and Rory.) "
342,NIXON: Hello. I believe it's Mister Gardner. Is that correct? Head of
343,Security? 
344,"GARDNER: Er, yes sir. Yes, Mister President. "
345,"NIXON: Mister Grant, is it? "
346,"GRANT: Yes, Mister President. "
347,NIXON: The hopes and dreams of millions of Americans stand here today
348,"at Cape Kennedy, and you're the men who guard those dreams. On behalf"
349,"of the American people, I thank you. "
350,"GARDNER: You're welcome, Mister President. "
351,"NIXON: I understand you have a baby on the way, Mister Grant. "
352,"GRANT: Yes, Mister President. "
353,"NIXON: What are you hoping for, a boy or a girl? "
354,"GRANT: Just a healthy American, sir. "
355,"NIXON: A healthy American will do just nicely. Now, fellows, listen."
356,"This man, here, code name the Doctor, is doing some work for me"
357,personally. Could you cut him a little slack? 
358,"GARDNER: Er, Mister President, he did break in to Apollo 11. "
359,DOCTOR: (silent) Sorry. 
360,"NIXON: Well, I'm sure he had a very good reason for that. But I need"
361,you to release him now so he can get on with some very important work
362,for the American people. Could you do that for me? 
363,GRANT: Well 
364,"NIXON: Son, I am your Commander in Chief. "
365,"GARDNER: Then I guess that would be fine, Mister President. "
366,NIXON: Glad to hear it. 
367,(The MP releases the Doctor.) 
368,"DOCTOR: Thank you. Bye, bye. "
369,"NIXON: Carry on, gentlemen. "
370,(Rory has been examining a model of Eagle. He breaks it.) 
371,RORY: Ahem. America salutes you.

373,[Renfrew's office]
374,
375,"CANTON: This place, it's been closed for years."
376,What have you been doing? 
377,"RENFREW: Oh, the child. She must be cared for. It's important. That's"
378,what they said. 
379,CANTON: That's what who said? 
380,[Attic corridor]
381,
382,(There is a metal door with a small hatch in it. A
383,woman wearing an eye patch looks out at Amy.) 
384,AMY: Hello. Who are you? 
385,(The woman turns away and speaks to someone else.) 
386,"EYE PATCH LADY: No, I think she's just dreaming. "
387,(The cover of the window slides shut. Amy goes to the door and opens
388,it. It is a cozy child's room.) 
389,AMY: Hello? I saw you looking through the hatch. 
390,(Except there isn't one any more.) 
391,[Bedroom]
392,
393,(There are a lot of photographs on the chest of
394,"drawers, including one of...) "
395,AMY: How? How can that be me? 
396,(She is pictured holding a baby. The astronaut enters.) 
397,"AMY: Who are you? I don't understand, so just tell me who you are. "
398,(The astronaut raises its gold visor. It is the little girl. There is a
399,crack in the helmet.) 
400,AMY: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shoot you. I'm glad I missed. But you
401,killed the Doctor. Or you're going to kill him. But who are you? Just
402,"please tell me, because I don't understand. "
403,GIRL: Please help me. Help me. Please. 
404,(Two aliens enter. Amy screams.) 
405,[Renfrew's office]
406,
407,(Someone knocks on the door. Renfrew answers it.) 
408,"RENFREW: It's just some questions. Yes, I see. "
409,CANTON: Who was that? Doctor Renfrew. Who was that? 
410,RENFREW: Who was who? 
411,(An alien enters. Canton activates his recorder.) 
412,"CANTON: What are you? You can tell me, because I won't remember. You"
413,invaded us. You're everywhere. 
414,"AMY : Help me! Please. I can't see. Somebody, help me. "
415,CANTON: Are you armed? 
416,SILENCE: This world is ours. We have ruled it since the wheel and the
417,fire. We have no need of weapons. 
418,CANTON: Yeah? 
419,(Canton shoots the alien.) 
420,CANTON: Welcome to America. Amy! 
421,[Oval office]
422,
423,(The Doctor has returned Nixon to Washington in the
424,Tardis.) 
425,DOCTOR: You have to tape everything that happens in this office. Every
426,"word, or you won't know if you're under the influence. "
427,"NIXON: Doctor, you have to give me more than this. What were you doing"
428,to Apollo 11? 
429,"DOCTOR: Thing. A clever thing. Now, no more questions. You have to"
430,trust me and nobody else. 
431,(River pops out of the Tardis with the telephone.) 
432,"RIVER: Doctor, it's Canton. Quick, he needs us."
433,
434,[Attic corridor]
435,
436,"AMY : Help me. Please, I can't. I can't see."
437,Somebody help me. 
438,(Canton finds the bedroom door. It is locked.) 
439,"CANTON: Amy! Amy, can you hear me? Amy, I'm going to try to blow the"
440,lock. I need you to stand back. 
441,"DOCTOR: Okay, gun down. I've got it. "
442,"RORY: Amy, we're here. Are you okay? "
443,AMY : I can't see.

452,anybody hear me? 
453,"(Amy's nanorecorder is on the floor, flashing.) "
454,"RORY: They took this out of her. How did they do that, Doctor? Why can"
455,I still hear her? 
456,RIVER: Is it a recording? 
457,"DOCTOR: Er, it defaults to live. This is current. Wherever she is right"
458,"now, this is what she's saying. "
459,"RORY: Amy, can you hear me? We're coming for you. Wherever you are,"
460,"we're coming, I swear. "
461,DOCTOR: She can't hear you. I'm so sorry. It's one way. 
462,"RORY: She can always hear me, Doctor. Always. Wherever she is, and she"
463,always knows that I am coming for her. Do you understand me? Always. 
464,"AMY : Doctor, are you out there? Can you hear me? Doctor? Oh, God."
465,"Please, please, Doctor, just get me out of this. "

486,CANTON: Hello again. 
487,"ISHEM: Sir, you've been in there for days. What the hell have you been"
488,doing? 
489,CANTON: It doesn't matter. I need Doctor Shepherd here right now. 
490,"ISHEM: Sir, I need to talk to Colonel Jefferson right now. "
491,"CANTON: No, you really don't. "
492,(Because their Commander in Chief walks out of the cell.) 
493,"NIXON: Er, hiya, fellows. I'm President Nixon. I want to tell you, on"
494,"behalf of the American people, how much we appreciate all of your hard"
495,work. 
496,"TELEVISION: The target for the Apollo 11 astronauts, the Moon, at"
497,"liftoff, will be at a distance of 218,096 miles away. We're just past"
498,the two minute mark in the countdown. T minus one minute fifty four
499,seconds and counting.

503,(They are examining the spacesuit with the alien's
504,own technology.) 
505,"RIVER: It's an exoskeleton. Basically, life support. There's about"
506,twenty different kinds of alien tech in here. 
507,DOCTOR: Who was she? Why put her in here? 
508,"RIVER: You put this on, you don't even need to eat. The suit processes"
509,"sunlight directly. It's got built in weaponry, and a communications"
510,system that can hack into anything. 
511,DOCTOR: Including the telephone network? 
512,RIVER: Easily. 
513,DOCTOR: But why phone the President? 
514,RIVER: It defaults to the highest authority it can find. The little
515,"girl gets frightened, the most powerful man on Earth gets a phone call."
516,The night terrors with a hotline to the White House. 
517,(The Doctor licks his invitation envelope.) 
518,"RIVER: You won't learn anything from that envelope, you know. "
519,DOCTOR: Purchased on earth. Perfectly ordinary stationery. Tardis blue.
520,"Summoned by a stranger who won't even show his face. That's a first,"
521,for me. How about you? 
522,RIVER: Our lives are back to front. Your future's my past. Your firsts
523,are my lasts. 
524,DOCTOR: That's not really what I asked. 
525,"RIVER: Ask something else, then. "
526,"DOCTOR: What are the Silence doing, raising a child? "
527,"RIVER: Keeping her safe, even giving her independence. "
528,DOCTOR: The only way to save Amy is to work out what the Silence are
529,doing. 
530,RORY: I know. 
531,DOCTOR: And every single thing we learn about them brings us a step
532,closer. 
533,"RORY: Yeah, Doctor, I get it. I know. "
534,"DOCTOR: Of course, it's possible she's not just any little girl. "
535,"RIVER: Well, I'd say she's human, going by the life support software. "
536,DOCTOR: But? 
537,RIVER: She climbed out of this suit. Like she forced her way out. She
538,must be incredibly strong. 
539,DOCTOR: Incredibly strong and running away. I like her. 
540,RIVER: We should be trying to find her. 
541,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know. But how? Anyway, I have the strangest feeling"
542,she's going to find us. 
543,"TELEVISION: Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read? Over. "
544,RORY: Why does it look like a NASA spacesuit? 
545,DOCTOR: Because that's what the Silence do. Think about it. They don't
546,make anything themselves. They don't have to. They get other life forms
547,to do it for them. 
548,"RIVER: So they're parasites, then. "
549,"DOCTOR: Superparasites, standing in the shadows of human history since"
550,the very beginning. We know they can influence human behaviour any way
551,they want. If they've been doing that on a global scale for thousands
552,of years. 
553,RORY: Then what? 
554,DOCTOR: Then why did the human race suddenly decide to go to the Moon? 
555,"TELEVISION: Ten, nine. Ignition sequence start. six, five, four "
556,DOCTOR: Because the Silence needed a spacesuit. 
557,"TELEVISION: One, zero. All engines running. Liftoff. We have a liftoff."
558,"Thirty two minutes past the hour, liftoff on Apollo 11."

562,SHEPHERD: My God. What is it? 
563,"CANTON: It's just an alien, Doctor Shepherd. "
564,SHEPHERD: Someone's already been treating it. 
565,"CANTON: Yeah, you've been treating it. "
566,SHEPHERD: Does Colonel Jefferson know this thing is here? 
567,CANTON: No. 
568,SHEPHERD: Then I'm going to tell him right now. 
569,CANTON: Again. 
570,"SHEPHERD: Sorry, what? "
571,CANTON: Exactly. 
572,"SHEPHERD: Sergeant, why was I called in here for no reason? "
573,(Shepherd leaves.) 
574,SILENCE: You tend to my wounds. You are foolish. 
575,(Canton uses a mobile phone to video record the conversation.) 
576,CANTON: Why? What would you do in my place? 
577,SILENCE: We have ruled your lives since your lives began. You should
578,"kill us all on sight, but you will never remember we were even here."
579,You will evolve. 
580,"CANTON: Yeah? Well, sorry to disappoint you, but thanks. That's exactly"
581,what I needed to hear. This is a videophone. Whatever a videophone is.
582,
583,[Warehouse]
584,
585,(The video file arrives on River's tricorder.) 
586,SILENCE [on screen]: You should kill us all on sight. 
587,"AMY : Help me, Doctor. "
588,(The spacesuit glove twitches.) 
589,"RIVER: This suit, it seems to be repairing itself. How's it doing that?"
590,"Doctor, a unit like this, would it ever be able to move without an"
591,occupant? 
592,DOCTOR: Why? 
593,"RIVER: Well, the little girl said the spaceman was coming to eat her."
594,Maybe that's exactly what happened. 
595,AMY : I love you. I know you think it's him. I know you think it
596,"ought to be him, but it's not. It's you. And when I see you again, I'm"
597,"going to tell you properly, just to see your stupid face. My life was"
598,so boring before you just dropped out of the sky. So just get your
599,"stupid face where I can see it, okay? Okay? "
600,DOCTOR: She'll be safe for now. No point in a dead hostage. 
601,RORY: Can't you save her? 
602,DOCTOR: I can track that signal back. Take us right to her. 
603,RORY: Then why haven't you? 
604,DOCTOR: Because then what? I find her and then what do I do? This isn't
605,an alien invasion. They live here. This is their empire. This is
606,kicking the Romans out of Rome. 
607,RORY: Rome fell. 
608,DOCTOR: I know. I was there. 
609,RORY: So was I. 
610,DOCTOR: Personal question. 
611,"RORY: Seriously, you? "
612,"DOCTOR: Do you ever remember it? Two thousand years, waiting for Amy?"
613,The last Centurion. 
614,RORY: No. 
615,DOCTOR: You're lying. 
616,RORY: Of course I'm lying. 
617,DOCTOR: Of course you are. Not the sort of thing anyone forgets. 
618,RORY: But I don't remember it all the time. It's like this door in my
619,head. I can keep it shut. 
620,"AMY : Please, please, just come and get me. Come and get me. "
621,TELEVISION: The Flight Controller's going to go for landing. Just five
622,"days since Apollo 11 blasted off from Cape Kennedy, this unprecedented"
623,journey is reaching its crucial moment. Armstrong and Aldrin are making
624,their descent to the surface of the Moon.

631,AMY: Where am I? Where is this? 
632,(Amy is fastened with alien tech.) 
633,SILENCE: You are Amelia Pond. 
634,AMY: You're ugly. Has anyone mentioned that to you? 
635,SILENCE: We do you honour. You will bring the Silence. But your part
636,will soon be over. 
637,"AMY: Whatever that means, you've made a big mistake, bringing me here,"
638,because wait until you see what's coming for you now. 
639,SILENCE: You have been here many days. 
640,"AMY: No, I just got here. You just put me in here. "
641,SILENCE: Your memory is weak. You have been here many days. 
642,"AMY: No. No, I can't have been. "
643,SILENCE: You will sleep now. Sleep. 
644,AMY: No. 
645,SILENCE: Sleep. 
646,AMY: No. Get off me. No. No. 
647,SILENCE: Sleep. 
648,AMY: No! 
649,(The Tardis materialises.) 
650,"DOCTOR: Oh, interesting. Very Aickman Road. I've seen one of these"
651,"before. Abandoned. I wonder how that happened? Oh, well I suppose I'm"
652,"about to find out. Rory, River, keep one Silent in eyeshot at all"
653,"times. Oh, hello. Sorry, you were in the middle of something. I just"
654,"had to say, though, have you seen what's on the telly? Oh, hello, Amy."
655,"Are you all right? Want to watch some television? Ah. Now, stay where"
656,"you are. Because look at me, I'm confident. You want to watch that, me,"
657,"when I'm confident. Oh, and this is my friend River. Nice hair, clever,"
658,"has her own gun, and unlike me, she really doesn't mind shooting"
659,"people. I shouldn't like that. Kind of do, a bit. "
660,"RIVER: Thank you, sweetie. "
661,"DOCTOR: I know you're team players and everything, but she'll"
662,definitely kill at least the first three of you. 
663,"RIVER: Well, the first seven, easily. "
664,DOCTOR: Seven? Really? 
665,"RIVER: Oh, eight for you, honey. "
666,DOCTOR: Stop it. 
667,RIVER: Make me. 
668,"DOCTOR: Yeah? Well, maybe I will. "
669,AMY: Is this really important flirting? Because I feel like I should be
670,higher on the list right now. 
671,"DOCTOR: Yes. Right. Sorry. As I was saying, my naughty friend here is"
672,"going to kill the first three of you to attack, plus him behind, so"
673,maybe you want to draw lots or have a quiz. 
674,(Rory is trying to free Amy.) 
675,AMY: What's he got? 
676,"RORY: Something, I hope. "
677,DOCTOR: Or maybe you could just listen a minute. Because all I really
678,want to do is accept your total surrender and then I'll let you go in
679,"peace. Yes, you've been interfering in human history for thousands of"
680,"years. Yes, people have suffered and died, but what's the point in two"
681,"hearts, if you can't be a bit forgiving, now and then? Ooo, the"
682,"Silence. You guys take that seriously, don't you? Okay, you got me. I'm"
683,"lying. I'm not really going to let you go that easily. Nice thought,"
684,"but it's not Christmas. First, you tell me about the girl. Who is she?"
685,Why is she important? What's she for? 
686,McCANDLESS : And we're getting a picture on the TV. 
687,"DOCTOR: Guys, sorry, but you're way out of time. Now, come on. A bit of"
688,"history for you. Aren't you proud? Because you helped. Now, do you know"
689,how many people are watching this live on the telly? Half a billion.
690,"And that's nothing, because the human race will spread out among the"
691,"stars. You just watch them fly. Billions and billions of them, for"
692,"billions and billions of years, and every single one of them at some"
693,"point in their lives, will look back at this man,"
694,"taking that very first step, and they will never, ever forget it. "
695,"TELEVISION: Okay, engine stop. ATA on the descent. Modes control both"

709,SILENCE [on TV]: You should kill us all on sight. You should kill us
710,all on sight. You should kill us all on sight. You should kill us all
711,on sight. 
712,"DOCTOR: You've given the order for your own execution, and the whole"
713,planet just heard you. 
714,SILENCE : You should kill us all on sight. 
715,ARMSTRONG : One giant leap for mankind. 
716,DOCTOR: And one whacking great kick up the backside for the Silence.
717,"You just raised an army against yourself and now, for a thousand"
718,"generations, you're going to be ordering them to destroy you every day."
719,How fast can you run? Because today's the day the human race throw you
720,"off their planet. They won't even know they're doing it. I think, quite"
721,"possibly, the word you're looking for right now is oops. Run! Guys, I"
722,mean us. Run. 
723,(The Silence is generating its electric shock. River starts shooting.)

727,"AMY: Look, will you just get your stupid face out of here. "
728,"RIVER: Run! Into the Tardis, quickly. "
729,"(The Doctor sonicks Amy free, and Rory helps her into the Tardis.) "
730,DOCTOR: Don't let them build to full power. 
731,"RIVER: I know. There's a reason why I'm shooting, honey. What are you"
732,doing? 
733,DOCTOR: Helping. 
734,RIVER: You've got a screwdriver. Go build a cabinet. 
735,DOCTOR: That's really rude. 
736,RIVER: Learn how to drive. 
737,"(The Doctor goes to the Tardis. River spins around and around, shooting"
738,all the time. Finally all the Silence lie dead.) 
739,"RIVER: My old fellow didn't see that, did he? He gets ever so cross. "
740,"RORY: So, what kind of doctor are you? "
741,(She shoots a Silence behind her without looking.) 
742,RIVER: Archaeology. Love a tomb.

744,[Tardis]
745,
746,DOCTOR: You can let me fly it. 
747,"RIVER: Yeah, or we could go where we're supposed to. "
748,AMY: What's the matter with you? 
749,RORY: You called me stupid. 
750,AMY: I always call you stupid. 
751,"RORY: No, but my face. "
752,(He shows her the nanorecorder he is holding.) 
753,"RORY: I wasn't sure who you were talking about. You know, me or "
754,AMY: Him? 
755,"RORY: Well, you did say dropped out of the sky. "

760,[Oval office]
761,
762,NIXON: So we're safe again. 
763,"DOCTOR: Safe? No, of course you're not safe. There's about a billion"
764,"other things out there just waiting to burn your whole world. But, if"
765,"you want to pretend you're safe, just so you can sleep at night? Okay,"
766,"you're safe. But you're not really. Canton. Until the next one, eh? "
767,CANTON: Looking forward to it. 
768,DOCTOR: Canton just wants to get married. Hell of a reason to kick him
769,out of the FBI. 
770,NIXON: I'm sure something can be arranged. 
771,DOCTOR: I'm counting on you. 
772,"NIXON: Er, Doctor. Canton here tells me you're, you're from the future."
773,"It hardly seems possible, but I was wondering "
774,DOCTOR: I should warn you I don't answer a lot of questions. 
775,NIXON: But I'm a President at the beginning of his time. Dare I ask.
776,Will I be remembered? 
777,"DOCTOR: Oh, Dicky. Tricky Dicky. They're never going to forget you. Say"
778,hi to David Frost for me. 
779,NIXON: David Frost? 
780,(The Tardis dematerialises.) 
781,NIXON: This person you want to marry. Black? 
782,CANTON: Yes. 
783,"NIXON: Hmm. I know what people think of me, but perhaps I'm a little"
784,more liberal. 
785,CANTON: He is. 
786,"NIXON: I think the Moon is far enough, for now, don't you, Mister"
787,Delaware? 
788,CANTON: I figured it might be.

791,
792,DOCTOR: You could come with us. 
793,"RIVER: I escape often enough, thank you. And I have a promise to live"
794,up to. You'll understand soon enough. 
795,DOCTOR: Okay. Up to you. See you next time. Call me. 
796,"RIVER: What, that's it? What's the matter with you? "
797,DOCTOR: Have I forgotten something? 
798,"RIVER: Oh, shut up. "
799,(River kisses the Doctor.) 
800,DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Interesting. 
801,RIVER: What's wrong? You're acting like we've never done that before. 
802,DOCTOR: We haven't. 
803,RIVER: We haven't? 
804,"DOCTOR: Oh, look at the time. Must be off. But it was very nice. It"
805,"was, it was good. It was er, unexpected. You know what they say."

817,AMY: So. 
818,DOCTOR: You're okay? 
819,AMY: Fine. Head's a bit weird. There's loads of stuff I can't quite
820,remember. 
821,DOCTOR: After effect of the Silence. Natural enough. That's not what I
822,was asking. You told me you were pregnant. 
823,AMY: Yes. 
824,DOCTOR: Why? 
825,"AMY: Because I was. I mean, I thought I was. It turns out I wasn't. "
826,"DOCTOR: No, why did you tell me? "
827,AMY: Because you're my friend. You're my best friend. 
828,DOCTOR: Hmm. Did you tell Rory?

832,AMY : No.

834,[Tardis]
835,
836,AMY: Why do you think? I travelled with you in this
837,"Tardis for so long. All that time. If I was pregnant for some of it,"
838,wouldn't it have had an effect? 
839,[Tardis lower deck]

860,the time. 
861,"RORY: Okay, that's a fair point. But you should've told me that you"
862,thought you were pregnant. I'm a nurse. I'm good with pregnancy. 
863,"AMY: Not, as it turns out, that good. So please stop being stupid. "
864,"RORY: Er, no, never. I'm never, ever, going to stop being stupid. "
865,"DOCTOR: So, this little girl. It's all about her. Who was she? Or we"
866,could just go off and have some adventures. Anyone in the mood for
