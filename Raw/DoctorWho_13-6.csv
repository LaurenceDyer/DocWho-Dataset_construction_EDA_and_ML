19,One 
20, [Antarctica]
21,
22," (In the most inhospitable place on Earth, two men"
23,are using small pickaxes to gather samples at the base of a glacier
24,face.) 
25,"MOBERLEY: Come on, Charles. We've got enough samples, surely. "
26,WINLETT: This isn't ice. This is something else. Have a look. 
27,(He lifts a round object of about six inches diameter out of the snow.)
28,
29,MOBERLEY: What is it? 
30,WINLETT: I don't know. Let's get it back to camp.
31,
32, [Research Lab]
33,
34, (The remaining ice and snow is being carefully
35,removed from the object.) 
36,"MOBERLEY: Ah. Animal, vegetable, or mineral? "
37,STEVENSON: Vegetable. 
38,"WINLETT: Yes, that's what we thought. "
39,STEVENSON: The cutaneous creasing is unmistakable. When it's properly
40,thawed out I can confirm it with a cytology test. 
41,WINLETT: The skin looks as hard as iron. 
42,"STEVENSON: Yes, it is a bit of a cannonball. How deep in the permafrost"
43,was it? 
44,WINLETT: I guess about the ninth layer. 
45,"MOBERLEY: That means it's been there for oh, twenty thousand years?"
46,"Well, what do you make of it, John? "
47,STEVENSON: Nothing at all yet. 
48,"MOBERLEY Oh, and I thought you were meant to be a botanist. "
49,STEVENSON: I've not seen anything remotely like it. 
50,"WINLETT: It looks tropical to me, like a gourd. "
51,"MOBERLEY: Oh rubbish, Charles. If it's from the late Pleistocene"
52,"period, it can't be tropical. It's a few million years since this part"
53,of Antarctica was rainforest. 
54,WINLETT: That's the accepted theory. Discoveries like this have
55,"destroyed accepted theories before now. Isn't that right, John? "
56,(Stevenson touches the object with his bare fingers.) 
57,WINLETT: John? 
58,STEVENSON: Hmm? Sorry. 
59,MOBERLEY: Is something wrong? 
60,STEVENSON: Don't you feel it? 
61,MOBERLEY: Feel what? 
62,STEVENSON: I don't know. There's something odd. Something. You don't
63,feel it? 
64,MOBERLEY: That must be that rice pudding you had for lunch. 
65,"STEVENSON: I'm not joking. It's alive. That's it, it's alive. "
66,MOBERLEY: Are you serious? 
67,STEVENSON: Yes. 
68,WINLETT: How can you tell? 
69,"STEVENSON: I don't know, but I'm certain that this is a living"
70,organism. 
71,"MOBERLEY: Yes, well, I think we should have some coffee. "
72,WINLETT: Coffee and a game of three-handed crib. Good idea. Come on. 
73,STEVENSON: I'll transmit pictures to London. They might have some idea.
74,
75,"WINLETT: John, come on."
76,
77, [Dunbar's office]
78,
79," (In London, at the World Ecology Bureau, a"
80,bureaucrat has a visitor in his rather cramped office.)
81,DUNBAR: Sir Colin insists that I show you these photographs which have
82,just been received from my expedition. 
83,"(The Doctor is sitting on Dunbar's desk, playing with his yoyo.) "
84,"DUNBAR: Personally, I don't think you can help us. "
85,DOCTOR: Don't you. Well. 
86,(Dunbar gives him the file.) 
87,"DOCTOR: Do sit down, Mister Dunbar. "
88,"(With the Doctor blocking the way to his own chair, Dunbar sits in the"
89,guest seat.) 
90,DUNBAR: These pictures have baffled all the experts. The only
91,reasonable explanation seems to be that the pod is from some extinct
92,species of plant. 
93,(The Doctor sits in Dunbar's chair with his feet on the desk.) 
94,DOCTOR: Have you considered an alternative explanation? 
95,DUNBAR: Name one. 
96,"DOCTOR: Well, that it might have originated in outer space. "
97,"DUNBAR: My dear Doctor, if you've seen anything like that before, you"
98,must have a very powerful telescope. 
99,"DOCTOR: Mister Dunbar, how long is it since there was vegetation in"
100,Antarctica? 
101,"DUNBAR: I thought you were the expert in these matters. Well, as a"
102,"matter of fact, that's one of the things our expedition is trying to"
103,"discover. It was found fairly deep in the permafrost, say twenty thirty"
104,thousand years under the ice. 
105,DOCTOR: Shush. It might still be ticking. 
106,DUNBAR: What? 
107,"DOCTOR: A time-bomb, Mister Dunbar, a time-bomb. Are you in contact"
108,with the expedition? 
109,"DUNBAR: My superior, Sir Colin Thackeray has a daily video link. Ten"
110,minutes of satellite time. 
111,"DOCTOR: Good. Tell them to keep a constant guard upon the pod, and not"
112,to touch it till I arrive. 
113,DUNBAR: You're leaving immediately? 
114,"DOCTOR: Why not? I've got my toothbrush. Remember, no touch pod. Could"
115,"be dangerous. (The Doctor leaves, brandishing his toothbrush. Dunbar"
116,picks up the telephone.) 
117,DUNBAR: Sir Colin? Dunbar here. That chap you called in from UNIT. Is
118,he quite sane?
119,
120, [Research Lab]
121,
122, (Stevenson is measuring the pod's diameter.) 
123,STEVENSON: Incredible. Charles? 
124,WINLETT : Yes? 
125,STEVENSON: Come in here a minute. 
126,(Winlett enters.) 
127,WINLETT: What's up? 
128,STEVENSON: It's growing. 
129,WINLETT: Eh? 
130,STEVENSON: It's grown five centimetres since this morning. 
131,WINLETT: Are you sure? 
132,STEVENSON: Check it yourself if you don't believe me. 
133,WINLETT: But it doesn't seem possible. 
134,"STEVENSON: I knew there was still life there. I said so, didn't I? "
135,"WINLETT: But it's just a pod. I mean, no root system. How can it grow"
136,without feeding? 
137,"STEVENSON: Sunlight, Charles. Ultra-violet radiation. "
138,WINLETT: But plants need nitrogen. 
139,STEVENSON: I believe this is fundamentally different. We may be
140,cultivating something that's going to shatter all our ideas about plant
141,growth. 
142,"WINLETT: Yes, well, don't get carried away, John. Remember what London"
143,said. 
144,STEVENSON: What do you mean? 
145,WINLETT: About leaving this thing alone. 
146,"STEVENSON: Until this Doctor character arrives, why should we? It's our"
147,pod. 
148,"WINLETT: John, we're working for the World Ecology Bureau. "
149,"STEVENSON: Oh, he's probably some old crank that Thackeray's dug up out"
150,of retirement. He'll have no more idea about the pod than we have. 
151,WINLETT: We'll soon find out. He's due in tomorrow. 
152,STEVENSON: And who needs him. It's our discovery. The less said about
153,it the better.

157," (The mansion is played by Athelhampton House,"
158,Dorset. The butler shows Dunbar into a part of Harrison Chase's mansion
159,which is given over to the cultivation of tropical plants. The master
160,of the house wears black leather gloves at all times.) 
161,"HARGREAVES: Mister Dunbar of the World Ecology Bureau, sir. "
162,(Hargreaves leaves.) 
163,CHASE: I don't think I've had the pleasure. And what is your Bureau
164,doing about bonsai? 
165,"DUNBAR: Bonsai, Mister Chase? "
166,"CHASE: Mutilation and torture, Mister Dunbar. The hideous, grotesque"
167,Japanese practice of miniaturising shrubs and trees. What is your
168,Bureau doing about that? 
169,"DUNBAR: Well, I "
170,"CHASE: No answer. You are concerned about the fate of the blue whale,"
171,"and the natterjack toad, but the loveliest, most defenceless part of"
172,"creation, the great kingdom of plant life receives no protection at"
173,all. 
174,DUNBAR: We try to conserve all the endangered species. 
175,"CHASE: I'm delighted to hear that, Mister Dunbar. Of course you know of"
176,"my concern, my mission, to protect the plant life of Mother Earth? "
177,"DUNBAR: I do, Mister Chase. Which is why I've come to show you"
178,something. A totally new kind of plant. 
179,CHASE: Hybrids. A crime against nature 
180,"DUNBAR: No, not a hybrid. It's a mysterious, unidentified pod recently"
181,discovered by one of our expeditions. 
182,(Dunbar hands Chase the photographs.) 
183,CHASE: Where was this found? 
184,DUNBAR: There's a theory that it's floated through space from some
185,"other biosphere. The really important thing is, it may be still viable"
186,and able to germinate. 
187,"CHASE: Mister Dunbar, I asked you where this pod was found. "
188,"DUNBAR: In the Antarctic. Now, in our violent and uncertain world,"
189,"Mister Chase, anything could happen. Such a valuable specimen could"
190,easily disappear for a price. 
191,CHASE: Where in the Antarctic? I should want to know the precise
192,location. 
193,(Dunbar gives Chase an envelope. Chase then goes over to an intercom
194,system.) 
195,CHASE: Hargreaves? 
196,"HARGREAVES : Yes, sir? "
197,CHASE: You and Mister Scorby please. 
198,"HARGREAVES : Certainly, sir. "
199,(Chase opens the envelope.) 
200,DUNBAR: X marks the spot. 
201,"CHASE: Forethought and initiative, Mister Dunbar. Two excellent"
202,attributes. We shall meet again very soon to discuss your remuneration.
203,
204,DUNBAR: You're very kind. 
205,(There is a knock on the door.) 
206,CHASE: Come. 
207,"(Hargreaves and Scorby enter. Everyone say Hi to  John Challis, before"
208,he became Boycie in Only Fools.) 
209,"HARGREAVES: Yes, sir? "
210,"CHASE: Hargreaves, show Mister Dunbar out. "
211,"HARGREAVES: This way, Mister Dunbar. "
212,(Hargreaves and Dunbar leave.) 
213,"SCORBY: You wanted to see me, Mister Chase? "
214,"CHASE: Yes, Scorby. I'm sending you on a little errand, and I want you"
215,to take Mister Keeler with you.

219," (Winlett is sitting near the pod, but has dozed"
220,"off. He wakes again and takes a sip of his drink, puts the mug down and"
221,"closes his eyes again. The pod opens and closes briefly, then opens"
222,fully. A tendril comes out and grabs Winlett's arm. He gets up and
223,"tries to get to the door, but he collapses.) "
224,WINLETT: Derek!
225,
226, [Living area]
227,
228, (Stevenson gets off his bunk.) 
229,STEVENSON: Was that Charles? 
230,MOBERLEY: What? What's happening?
231,
232, [Research Lab]
233,
234, (They go along the corridor to the lab module.) 
235,STEVENSON: Charles? 
236,"(He touches Winlett and he rolls onto his back, showing us his eyes"
237,staring out from a leaf-green face.)
238,
239, [Dunbar's office]
240,
241, THACKERAY: This telex from Stevenson. What do you
242,make of it? 
243,DUNBAR: (reads) Pod carries infection. Winlett seriously ill. Medicaid
244,"needed urgently. Could have been more informative, Sir Colin. "
245,THACKERAY: He probably doesn't know any more. I have ordered Medical
246,"Team to go to the base, but I understand weather conditions are bad."
247,It's bound to take at least a day or two. 
248,DUNBAR: The people from UNIT should be arriving now. Perhaps they can
249,help.
250,
251, [Outside Antarctic Research]
252,
253, (A helicopter lands.) 
254,MOBERLEY: Hello! So you made it. Welcome to the loneliest spot on
255,Earth. You must be the Doctor. 
256,"(The Doctor is in his usual clothes, while Sarah is in furs.) "
257,DOCTOR: Yes. 
258,MOBERLEY: We were expecting someone much older. 
259,DOCTOR: I'm only seven hundred and forty nine. I used to be even
260,younger. 
261,(The helicopter leaves.) 
262,MOBERLEY: Derek Moberley. 
263,"SARAH: Sarah Jane Smith, the young Doctor's assistant. "
264,DOCTOR: How many of you live here? 
265,"MOBERLEY: Anything up to a dozen, but of course we're down to three at"
266,the moment. Let's get inside. 
267,SARAH: Yes. 
268,DOCTOR: Where are the others? 
269,"MOBERLEY: Out at South Bend, not sixty miles away, measuring the ice"
270,cap. If they're getting this kind of weather they're welcome to it.
271,Come on.
272,
273, [Passageway]
274,
275, SARAH: How do you stand it? 
276,"MOBERLEY: Oh, sometimes it gets quite warm. Ten degrees below freezing."
277,
278,"SARAH: Crikey, I feel as though I've got frostbite already. "
279,"MOBERLEY: I'll get you something hot to drink in a tick. Er, are you"
280,okay dressed like that? You don't seem to notice the cold. 
281,"DOCTOR: I haven't come ten thousand miles to discuss the weather,"
282,Mister Moberley. Can I see the sick man? 
283,"MOBERLEY: Yes, of course. Down this way."
284,
285, [Sickbay]
286,
287," (Winlett is very green now, and twitching under"
288,the sheet.) 
289,"STEVENSON: He seems to be conscious, but he hasn't spoken a word since"
290,last night. 
291,DOCTOR: What's his body temperature? 
292,"STEVENSON: Well, that's the amazing thing. I've been trying to keep him"
293,warm but it's dropping hourly. 
294,DOCTOR: And the pulse rate? 
295,"STEVENSON: His body temperature is forty six, his pulse rate is"
296,"eighteen a minute. I'm no medical expert, but on those figures he"
297,"should be dead, shouldn't he? "
298,DOCTOR: I wonder. 
299,(The Doctor pulls back the sheet. Winlett's body is covered in green
300,tendrils.) 
301,STEVENSON: Good grief! It wasn't like that an hour ago. 
302,DOCTOR: Then it's accelerating. How long before a medical team arrives?
303,
304,"STEVENSON: Well, it's difficult to say in these conditions. Hopefully"
305,tomorrow. 
306,"DOCTOR: I don't think that's going to be soon enough, Mister Stevenson."
307,
308, [Living area]
309,
310, (Sarah is breathing on her fingers to bring them
311,back to life. Moberley brings her a mug.) 
312,"MOBERLEY: There, that ought to warm you up. "
313,SARAH: Thanks. 
314,MOBERLEY: Better? 
315,"SARAH: Mmm. So, you say you just found this pod lying there empty. "
316,"MOBERLEY: Yes, and Charles in that state. Now does that make any kind"
317,of sense to you? 
318,(A blue light on the wall flashes and beeps.) 
319,MOBERLEY: Would you excuse me? 
320,SARAH: Yes. 
321,MOBERLEY: Radio. 
322,"SARAH: Oh, sure."
323,
324, [Sickbay]
325,
326," STEVENSON: Have you any idea what it can be,"
327,Doctor? 
328,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's why I came here. "
329,STEVENSON: I thought you came here to see the pod. 
330,"DOCTOR: Exactly. Before anything happened. Unfortunately, it already"
331,has. Where's the lab? 
332,STEVENSON: I'll show you.
333,
334, [Research Lab]
335,
336, (Moberley is on the radio.) 
337,"MOBERLEY: Okay, Mike, but try to get something moving. His condition's"
338,pretty desperate. Over. 
339,MIKE : Understood. Out. 
340,(Stevenson and the Doctor enter.) 
341,"MOBERLEY: Bad news, John. That was Mike Wilson at South Bend. The"
342,medical team's turned back. 
343,STEVENSON: What about Charles? Did you tell them how bad he is? 
344,MOBERLEY: They were in white-out conditions and their Snow Cat's fallen
345,into a crevasse. But Mike is in touch with the Royal Marine Survival
346,Team. They might be able to help. They'll try again as soon as the
347,weather lifts. 
348,"STEVENSON: That'll be too late. He's dying, isn't he, Doctor? "
349,DOCTOR: No. 
350,STEVENSON: I thought you said in the sickbay 
351,"DOCTOR: It's more serious than death, Mister Stevenson. He's changing"
352,form. 
353,STEVENSON: Changing form? 
354,DOCTOR: Yes. We need a blood test. 
355,MOBERLEY: I'm a zoologist. I could prepare a specimen slide if it'll
356,help? 
357,"DOCTOR: Yes, it would help, thank you. "
358,MOBERLEY: Right. 
359,(Moberley leaves.) 
360,DOCTOR: Pod. 
361,STEVENSON: It's over here. 
362,DOCTOR: Why did it open? Why? 
363,"STEVENSON: Well, that, that could be my fault. It was frozen stiff when"
364,we took it out of the ice. I was certain there was still life there. I
365,put in under a lamp and it started to expand. 
366,"DOCTOR: Mister Stevenson, what you have done could result in the total"
367,destruction of all life on this planet.
368,
369, [Sickbay]
370,
371, (Moberley draws a syringe of red blood from
372,Winlett.) 
373,"MOBERLEY: Charles? We're trying our best, Charles. Help's on its way."
374,
375, [Antarctica]
376,
377," (At the base of the glacier, the Doctor is digging"
378,in the snow.) 
379,"SARAH: Doctor? Doctor, what are we looking for? "
380,"DOCTOR: Are you sure this is the place, Stevenson? "
381,"STEVENSON: Yes, and if you told us what you were doing, perhaps we"
382,could help. 
383,"DOCTOR: Yes, just as I thought. "
384,SARAH: Another pod! 
385,STEVENSON: How did you? Will there be any more? 
386,"DOCTOR: No. They travel in pairs, like policeman. "
387,"SARAH: What are we going to do with it, buy it a truncheon? "
388,DOCTOR: No. Take it into custody and keep it in the freezer.
389,
390, [Research Lab]
391,
392," STEVENSON: Well, that ought to keep it cool. "
393,"SARAH: Who sold you that, an Eskimo? "
394,"STEVENSON: I know a freezer seems superfluous out here, but we do need"
395,it to keep snow samples in until they're analysed. 
396,MOBERLEY: Doctor? 
397,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
398,(Moberley is using a microscope.) 
399,MOBERLEY: Take a look at this blood sample. 
400,DOCTOR: How's Winlett? 
401,MOBERLEY: Winlett? He's barely recognisable. It's as if he's turning
402,into some sort of a hideous monster. 
403,"DOCTOR: That's exactly what is happening, Moberley. "
404,"MOBERLEY: Yes, but there must be an answer. "
405,DOCTOR: If you can just increase the magnification. Ah! Yes. Take a
406,look at that. 
407,MOBERLEY: These aren't blood platelets. 
408,DOCTOR: Do you recognise them? 
409,(Stevenson looks down the microscope.) 
410,STEVENSON: Schizophytes. 
411,DOCTOR: Exactly. 
412,STEVENSON: I don't believe it. It's not possible. 
413,"SARAH: Would someone mind explaining what these schizophytes are,"
414,please? 
415,STEVENSON: The smallest known living organisms. Plant bacteria. 
416,SARAH: Plant bacteria in someone's bloodstream? 
417,"DOCTOR: Interesting, isn't it? A human being whose blood is turning"
418,into vegetable soup. 
419,SARAH: Listen. 
420,MOBERLEY: That's very low by the sound of it. 
421,"STEVENSON: It's the medical aircraft. Quick, Derek, get the landing"
422,strip lights on. 
423,MOBERLEY: They won't see anything in this blizzard.
424,
425, [Living area]
426,
427, SARAH: Should we come out and help you? 
428,"MOBERLEY: No, John and I know our way around out there. It's easy to"
429,get lost. 
430,SARAH: Okay. 
431,MOBERLEY: You ready? 
432,STEVENSON: Ready. 
433,MOBERLEY: Right. 
434,(Stevenson and Moberley leave.) 
435,SARAH: Will they be able to help that man? 
436,"DOCTOR: I don't know, Sarah. He's halfway towards becoming a Krynoid. "
437,SARAH: Krynoid? 
438,DOCTOR: Yes. A progression of the pod. 
439,SARAH: So you recognised it. 
440,"DOCTOR: Yes, I was fairly certain when I saw the photographs. Now I'm"
441,sure. 
442,"SARAH: Well, what is a Krynoid? I mean, what does it do? "
443,"DOCTOR: I suppose you could call it a galactic weed, except it's"
444,deadlier than any weed you know. 
445,SARAH: In what way? 
446,"DOCTOR: Well, on most planets, the animals eat the vegetation, hmm? "
447,SARAH: Mmm hmm. 
448,"DOCTOR: On planets where the Krynoid gets established, the vegetation"
449,eats the animals. 
450,SARAH: But that's terrifying. 
451,DOCTOR: Yes. 
452,"SARAH: Well, how did it get through space? "
453,DOCTOR: An obvious question. I wish I knew the answer. Possibly their
454,"planet of origin is turbulent from time to time, any internal"
455,explosions could cause surface matter to go shooting into space. 
456,SARAH: So what do we do about Winlett? 
457,"DOCTOR: I'm thinking Sarah, I'm thinking."
458,
459, [Passageway]
460,
461,(Moberley and Stevenson help two more men into the

467," MOBERLEY: Right, into the chair. There you are. "
468,SARAH: Let me take that. 
469,(Sarah takes a rucksack.) 
470,"STEVENSON: Come on, sit yourselves down. "
471,"SARAH: Come on, sit down over here. "
472,"STEVENSON: Brandy, Derek? "
473,MOBERLEY: Right. 
474,DOCTOR: Is this the medical team? 
475,STEVENSON: They were flying a private plane. 
476,"MOBERLEY: They just got themselves lost. Here, brandy. "
477,SCORBY: Thanks. 
478,KEELER: Sorry to be such a nuisance. 
479,SCORBY: We were nearly out of fuel when we saw your lights. 
480,SARAH: You were very lucky. Lights are few and far between out here. 
481,DOCTOR: I'd like to take another look at the patient. 
482,"STEVENSON: What, now? "
483,"DOCTOR: Now. Yes, come on. "
484,STEVENSON: You just relax and thaw out. 
485,"SCORBY: Right, thanks. "
486,"(The Doctor, Sarah, Moberley and Stevenson leave.) "

488,questions

497,MOBERLEY: We can do nothing except just watch it happen. 
498,"DOCTOR: There is something you can do, but it's drastic. "
499,"STEVENSON: Well, what? "
500,DOCTOR: Amputate the arm. 
501,MOBERLEY: What good would that do? Can't you see the infection's all
502,over his body? 
503,"DOCTOR: Yes, but the arm's the source of the infection. It might stop"
504,it spreading. 
505,"MOBERLEY: You say might. What you mean is, you don't know. "
506,DOCTOR: Well of course I don't know! But it'd give you a breathing
507,"space while you try and find an antidote. That's a chance worth taking,"
508,isn't it? 
509,MOBERLEY: And who's going to perform this operation? 
510,"DOCTOR: Oh you are, Moberley. You're the only one who can. "
511,MOBERLEY: But I'm not a surgeon. What about you? You're a doctor. 
512,DOCTOR: You must help yourselves. 
513,"SARAH: He's not a doctor of medicine. Stevenson's a botanist, you're a"
514,zoologist. Ask yourself who's most qualified among us. 
515,MOBERLEY: But I can't operate on Winlett. It's absurd! 
516,"SARAH: Oh, at least you could try. You studied physiology, you know how"
517,to handle a scalpel. 
518,"MOBERLEY: To dissect dead specimens, yes, but Charles is a human being."
519,
520,"SARAH: He won't be much longer if you don't operate! Look, have you got"
521,a medical kit? 
522,STEVENSON: We've a full medical kit in the lab.

553,SCORBY: I don't like guns in the wrong hands.

555,KEELER: There's no need for that. They're not going to try and shoot
556,us. 
557,SCORBY: I'd rather not give them the chance. I said keep watch. 
558,KEELER: I wish you'd stop behaving like some cheap gangster. All we've

563,"SCORBY: Are you a betting man, Keeler? "
564,KEELER: Now just a minute. This is the first you've said. I want to
565,know exactly what it is you're planning. 
566,"SCORBY: All right, Keeler. Tomorrow, we did a nice big hole in the"
567,"snow. Big enough for, say, five bodies. We fill it up, we take the pod,"
568,"we fly home. No witnesses, nothing. Just another lost expedition. "
569,"KEELER: You're mad. You're mad. You're mad. I'm not doing that. Oh, no."

589,"DOCTOR: Not Charles, the alien. "
590,STEVENSON: Alien? 
591,"DOCTOR: Not of this world, Stevenson. I told you he was changing form."
592,Already his mind's been taken over. Very soon his entire body will

622,message saying an infection has broken out. 
623,CHASE: Infection? What sort of infection? 
624,"DUNBAR: Apparently a virus conveyed by the pod. Now, if you get that"
625,"pod, you'll probably have to take precautions. "
626,CHASE: If? There's no question of if. I have sent my most efficient
627,man. 
628,DUNBAR: To Antarctica? 
629,CHASE: Yes. It will be easier to acquire the pod there rather than wait
630,for its arrival in England and the resultant publicity. By that time it
631,will be better protected than the Crown Jewels. 
632,"DUNBAR: You're going well outside the law, Mister Chase. "
633,CHASE: I understand policemen are few and far between in the Antarctic.

635,"DUNBAR: Look, if there are any repercussions, have I your word you'll"
636,preserve my anonymity. 
637,"CHASE: Don't worry, I always take care of my employees. It wouldn't do"
638,if a public servant of your standing were found betraying trust and
639,"selling secrets, would it. "
640,"DUNBAR: No. On the other hand, I took up a career hoping to reach the"
641,"top, but I've seen time-serving nonentities promoted over my head. "
642,"CHASE: Yes, it must be most galling. The only alternative is to seek"
643,"other forms of reward, which you have most sensibly done. I think you"
644,"will find this is the amount we agreed for your, er, help. "
645,(Chase opens a briefcase on a side table. It is full of banknotes.)

767,and warmth. There's only one place he can find food and warmth. 
768,SCORBY: You mean this camp.

785,DOCTOR: Odd things have been happening. Odd and dangerous. I don't
786,thing you'd understand. 
787,SCORBY: Try me. 
788,"DOCTOR: All right. At its simplest, the man who went mad is no longer a"
789,man in any sense you'd recognise. 
790,"KEELER: Well, if he's not a man, what is he? "

808,(The Doctor nudges Stevenson with his knee.) 
809,SCORBY: What did you say? Taken it out? Taken it out of where? 
810,KEELER: They've got a second pod. 
811,"SCORBY: Then we're not going back empty handed, are we? Where is it? "
812,"DOCTOR: Oh, don't be a bigger fool than you already are. Don't you"
813,understand anything? It's dangerous. 
814,"SCORBY: I asked you a question, Doctor. Where is the pod? "
815,"(The Doctor gazes levelly at the gun barrel, so Scorby puts it to"

834,"STEVENSON: No, this is unique now. Priceless, as you are no doubt"
835,aware. 
836,SCORBY: So what's to stop this breaking open like the other one? 
837,STEVENSON: It's quite safe at this temperature. 
838,"SCORBY: Well, it's going on a little journey. You must have something"
839,here to keep it cool. 
840,STEVENSON: We have thermal containers. 
841,SCORBY: Get one. There's something I don't quite understand. Where does
842,the power come from to keep this place going? 
843,STEVENSON: We have a new fuel cell system half a mile from here. 
844,SCORBY: This alien creature could be hiding there. 
845,"STEVENSON: No, we checked that an hour ago. "
846, [Living area]

848,"SARAH: Yes, we're not likely to run away. "
849,"DOCTOR: You don't like violence, do you, Keeler? Not like your friend."
850,"What are you, a scientist? Botanist, perhaps. Is that it? Were you sent"
851,here to identify the pod? Surely you understand the implications of
852,what I'm saying? 
853,KEELER: We know what we're doing. 
854,DOCTOR: I wish I could believe you. 
855,"KEELER: Shut up, shut up! "
856,"SARAH: You remember what happened to Winlett. Well, things are getting"
857,"out of control and you don't know how to handle it. If you release us,"
858,then we can fight it together. 
859,(Stevenson and Scorby enter.) 
860,"KEELER: Oh, for God's sake let's get out of here quickly before that"
861,monster thing comes back. 
862,(Scorby gives Keeler the insulated box and takes the gun.)

864,KEELER: Rope. Excuse me. 
865,"(Keeler ties Stevenson's hands behind his back, then his feet."
866,"Meanwhile, the Krynoid is on the move.) "

868,KEELER: You're not going to shoot them in cold blood? 
869,"SCORBY: Why not? No, I've got a better idea. Come here, miss. "

876, SCORBY: Take us to the power plant. 
877,SARAH: I don't know what you mean.

888,while Keeler ties Sarah to a pipe.) 
889,"KEELER: What's that thing, Scorby? "
890,SCORBY: This power system provides energy for the whole camp. There are
891,wires running from here to every building. So we don't need to dig a
892,hole after all. We just obliterate them. A real fireworks display. 
893,SARAH: That's murder. Cold-blooded murder.

907,(Keeler goes back to Sarah.) 
908,SARAH: He doesn't have to kill us. You've got the pod. 
909,"SCORBY: There, that should do it. That bomb will set off a fault in the"
910,"system that'll blow the whole camp to smithereens, leaving no trace"
911,"whatsoever. It's ingenious, don't you think? "
912,KEELER: No! No! I can't let you do it. 
913,"(Keeler tries to fight Scorby, but gets caught in a neck lock.) "
914,"SCORBY: It's too lake, Keeler. I've started the countdown. Now, let's"
915,get out. 
916,(Keeler leaves.) 
917,SCORBY: You shouldn't have long to wait. Ten minutes at the outside. 
918, [Living area] 
919, (The Doctor and Stevenson are free.) 
920,DOCTOR: Contact the main base on the radio. 
921,STEVENSON: Right. 
922,DOCTOR: See if they can intercept that aeroplane. 
923,STEVENSON: What about the Krynoid? 
924,DOCTOR: We'll just have to take a chance on that. 
925,(The Doctor leaves.) 
926, [Outside Antarctic Research] 
927, DOCTOR: Sarah! 
928,(An aeroplane motor starts up.) 
929, [Research lab] 
930," STEVENSON: Hello, main base. Hello, main base. Can"
931,you hear me? Over. 
932,(The Krynoid bursts in and attacks Stevenson. The Doctor sees the
933,aeroplane take off.) 
934, [Generator plant] 
935, (There is less than a minute on the timer as the
936,Doctor runs across the wastes. The Krynoid is also heading for the
937,plant. The Doctor bursts in.) 
938,"SARAH: Doctor! Quick, quick. "
939,DOCTOR: What's the hurry? 
940,SARAH: There's a time bomb over there. We've only got seconds. Where's
941,Stevenson? 
942,DOCTOR: I'll have to try and warn him. 
943,(Twenty seconds. Sarah is finally free.) 
944,DOCTOR: There. 
945,(The Krynoid enters. They lure it to the far side of the plant then
946,"double back and out of the door, fastening it behind them. The Doctor"
947,"and Sarah run as the creature scrabbles at the door. Two, one, kaBOOM!"
948,"A series of secondary explosion run to the Research base, blowing that"
949,"to matchwood, too.) "
950, Part Three
951,
952, [Antarctica] 
953, (Antarctica is here played by Buckland Quarry.
954,Sarah wakes to the sound of a caterpillar-tracked vehicle approaching.
955,"One man in an orange parka gets out, followed by two in whites.) "
956,CHESTER: Come on. 
957,(The group go over to Sarah.) 
958,"CHESTER: Are you all right? Look, we're from South Bend. These marines"
959,got me through. We heard the explosion. What happened? 
960,SARAH: The Doctor. Where's the Doctor? 
961,"CHESTER: It's all right, I'm a doctor. Doctor Chester. Look, we're"
962,going to take care of you. Don't worry. 
963,"SARAH: No, no, you don't understand. He's trying to reach the camp."
964,We've got to find him. Doctor! 
965,"CHESTER: Look, hang about. Take it easy. "
966,SARAH: Doctor! 
967,(Sarah leads the men off. Then she spots something.) 
968,SARAH: Doctor! 
969,"(The Doctor is lying face down, half covered in snow.) "
970,SARAH: Help me! 
971,(They roll him over.) 
972,SARAH: He's alive. 
973,DOCTOR: Good morning. 
974, [Plant lab] 
975, (Scorby and Keeler enter the room that leads into
976,"the one with the plants. There is a desk, and filing cabinets here.) "
977,SCORBY: Must be in the greenhouse. Mister Chase? Mission accomplished. 
978,(Chase comes in from tending his plants.) 
979,CHASE: Well? Open it. 
980,(Scorby obeys. Keeler is keeping well back.) 
981,CHASE: Astounding. I can scarcely believe it. 
982,SCORBY: I wouldn't touch it. 
983,CHASE: Why not? 
984,"SCORBY: Well, there was this other pod, and one of the expedition"
985,apparently got infected by it. 
986,"CHASE: Yes, so I heard. What happened exactly? "
987,KEELER: It was all very strange. He went mad and killed somebody. 
988,"SCORBY: Yeah, they told us the pod took him over in some way. "
989,CHASE: Oh. What became of this other pod? 
990,SCORBY: It was destroyed. We had to blow the whole place to smithereens
991,plus everyone in it. 
992,CHASE: What a pity. I could have had two pods. 
993,(A knock at the door.) 
994,CHASE: Come. 
995,"HARGREAVES: Mister Dunbar, sir. "
996,"CHASE: Ah, come in, Dunbar. It's all right. These are the two men who"
997,brought back the pod. 
998,(Hargreaves leaves.) 
999,CHASE: They know of your contribution to the enterprise. 
1000,DUNBAR: I had no idea you'd go to such terrible lengths to get it. 
1001,CHASE: The destruction of the others was necessary. 
1002,DUNBAR: Necessary? 
1003,"CHASE: There it is. Look at it. Like me, I imagine you couldn't wait to"
1004,see it with your own eyes. 
1005,"DUNBAR: Unlike you, I can hardly bear to look at it, considering the"
1006,cost. 
1007,"CHASE: Since you mention cost, Dunbar, you've already been well paid"
1008,"for your part, so keep a stiff upper lip, forget your qualms. The"
1009,object has been achieved. We can all relax. 
1010,DUNBAR: Not quite. 
1011,CHASE: No? 
1012,DUNBAR: They weren't all wiped out. That's what I came to warn you
1013,about. The Doctor and his assistant are still alive. 
1014,SCORBY: That's not possible. 
1015,DUNBAR: The Doctor's meeting Sir Colin and me in two hours time. 
1016, [Dunbar's office] 
1017, THACKERAY: But why should people go to such
1018,lengths to get their hands on the pod? 
1019,DOCTOR: Greed. Greed. The most dangerous impulse in the universe. Do
1020,you realise that on this planet the pod is unique? I use the word with
1021,"precision. Unique. And to some people, its uniqueness makes it valuable"
1022,at any cost. 
1023,DUNBAR: You make these two mystery men sound like fanatics. 
1024,DOCTOR: Fanatics? Tell him. You tell him. You tell him! 
1025,SARAH: These two mystery men had everything planned. They had an
1026,"aeroplane, guns, even a bomb. It was organised down to the last detail."
1027,"Now, if that isn't fanaticism, well, what is? "
1028,DUNBAR: Surely you're exaggerating. 
1029,"SARAH: Exaggerate? Now look, I was there. We were nearly killed! "
1030,"DOCTOR: Be calm. Be calm. Listen, both of you. Are you both listening"
1031,"to me? I think they were dangerous, but they were stooges. I believe"
1032,they were working for someone else. 
1033,"SARAH: And if that's true, that someone else must be a complete madman."
1034,
1035,DOCTOR: What's more to the point is how they knew of the pod's
1036,"existence. The discovery had been reported only to your department,"
1037,correct? 
1038,"THACKERAY: That's correct. But Doctor, I trust you're not suggesting"
1039,that information was leaked from this bureau? 
1040,DOCTOR: Why not? Why shouldn't it be? 
1041,"DUNBAR: Doctor, how can you suggest such a thing? "
1042,"THACKERAY: In any case, what would be the gain? "
1043,"DOCTOR: Oh, money. "
1044,DUNBAR: Money? 
1045,"DOCTOR: Yes, money. Hired thieves and murderers don't usually work for"
1046,love. 
1047,"DUNBAR: Since you seem to have it all sewn up, Doctor, perhaps you can"
1048,tell us where the pod is now? 
1049,"DOCTOR: I'll make a guess. Right here, in this country. Action! Action,"
1050,"that's what we need. If we don't find that pod before it germinates,"
1051,"it'll be the end of everything. Everything, you understand? Even your"
1052,pension! 
1053,"THACKERAY: Very well, Doctor. You've made your point. All the"
1054,facilities of this bureau will be placed at your disposal. 
1055,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
1056,"THACKERAY: All right, Dunbar? "
1057,"DUNBAR: I'll organise anything you require, Doctor. "
1058,"DOCTOR: Good. Then organise us to the Botanic Institute, now. "
1059, [Outside the World Ecology Bureau]
1060,
1061, (The Doctor and Sarah leave the building - played
1062,by the BBC television centre - and are met by a chauffeur.) 
1063,CHAUFFEUR: Doctor? 
1064,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1065,"CHAUFFEUR: This car was ordered for you, sir. "
1066,DOCTOR: Good. Let's go. 
1067, [Dunbar's office] 
1068," (Now he's alone, Dunbar is making a telephone"
1069,call.) 
1070,"DUNBAR: It's all right, Mister Chase. They're being taken care of. But"
1071,I must warn you about that pod. 
1072, [Muddy lane] 
1073," (The limousine stops in the middle of a muddy,"
1074,"potholed lane. We're back at the quarry, folks.) "
1075,DOCTOR: What's going on? Where are we? 
1076,(The chauffeur turns around with a gun in his hand.) 
1077,"CHAUFFEUR: We're in a nice deserted place, Doctor. "
1078,DOCTOR: Who do you work for? 
1079,"CHAUFFEUR: Both of you, out. This side. "
1080,(The chauffeur gets out first. The Doctor opens his door.) 
1081,DOCTOR: Now just a minute. 
1082,(The Doctor's window is wound down and he grabs the man through the
1083,"empty space, pulling him against the door then pushing him away onto"
1084,the ground.) 
1085,"DOCTOR: Sarah, come on. "
1086,(They run before the chauffeur can pick himself and his gun up out of
1087,"the mud and try to take a few shots at them, and scramble down a steep"
1088,slope.) 
1089,DOCTOR: Come on. 
1090,(The Doctor and Sarah hide amongst the piles of sand.) 
1091,"SARAH: Hey, down here. Down here, cloth-eyes. Are you blind? "
1092,(The chauffeur runs down the slope and onto a pile of sand below the
1093,big hopper to look around. The Doctor distracts him by throwing a stone
1094,"onto a corrugated roof, then pounces. He punches the man's lights out"
1095,and they return to the limo.) 
1096,DOCTOR: You try the boot. 
1097,"SARAH: Right, give us the key. "
1098,(The Doctor searches the glove compartment. Sarah finds a framed print
1099,of a fritillaria in the boot.) 
1100,"SARAH: Hey, Doctor. "
1101,DOCTOR: Yes? 
1102,SARAH: Here. 
1103,DOCTOR: What? 
1104,SARAH: Look. 
1105,(He reads the artist's signature.) 
1106,DOCTOR: Amelia Ducat. 
1107,SARAH: That's interesting. 
1108,DOCTOR: Is it? Why? 
1109,"SARAH: Well, Amelia Ducat (French pronunciation) is only one of the"
1110,world's leading flower artists. 
1111, [Amelia's studio] 
1112, (A quaint cottage with china dogs and plates on
1113,display on a dado rail. The artist herself is a silver-haired old
1114,lady.) 
1115,"AMELIA: Oh, yes, a perfect example. Fritillaria meleagris. "
1116,DOCTOR: Is that the common snakes-head fritillary? 
1117,AMELIA: And why are you asking me? 
1118,"DOCTOR: No, I mean did you paint it, Miss Ducat. (pronounced Duket.) "
1119,"AMELIA: The name is Ducat (Du-cah) actually. Yes, of course I painted"
1120,it. I camped out on the Chilterns night after night to catch it at
1121,sunrise. 
1122,DOCTOR: We're trying to trace the owner. 
1123,AMELIA: Isn't it yours? 
1124,DOCTOR: No. We found it in a car boot. 
1125,AMELIA: A car boot? 
1126,DOCTOR: A Daimler car boot. 
1127,AMELIA: The car is immaterial. 
1128,SARAH: The driver wasn't. He tried to kill us. 
1129,DOCTOR: Can you remember who bought this particular painting? 
1130,"AMELIA: Well, nobody. I haven't finished it yet. "
1131,"SARAH: No, hang about, not that one. This one, Miss Ducat. "
1132,DOCTOR: Common snakes-head fritillary. 
1133,"AMELIA: Oh, that one. Oh, dear me. It was a long time ago. Now what was"
1134,his name? Something like face? Mace? Lace? 
1135,SARAH: Pace? 
1136,DOCTOR: Base? 
1137,AMELIA: That's right. Chase! Of course. Harrison Chase the millionaire.
1138,Good lord. He never paid me! 
1139, [Chase's plant lab] 
1140," KEELER: No, the x-rays don't show any signs of"
1141,"activity, so "
1142,"CHASE: We mustn't give up, Keeler. I'm certain we're on the verge of a"
1143,breakthrough. 
1144,"KEELER: Yes, but if we. (sighs) Mister Chase, please listen. Something"
1145,weird happened in Antarctica. A man came into contact with the other
1146,"pod, and according to the Doctor, he turned into an alien. Now I don't"
1147,"know what he meant exactly, but I believe it did happen, so please"
1148,let's stop this experiment now. 
1149,"CHASE: No, Keeler. Dunbar's explained everything to me. Provided we"
1150,"take the proper precautions, there is no danger. Now, inject the pod"
1151,with fixed nitrogen. 
1152,(A telephone rings. Chase signals Keeler to answer it.) 
1153,"KEELER: Special Projects lab. Yes. Yes, he's here. Urgent call from"
1154,Dunbar. Your chauffeur's in hospital. 
1155, [Outside Chase's mansion] 
1156, (The Doctor drives the Daimler up to an arched
1157,gateway in a stone wall.) 
1158,SARAH: I hope this works. 
1159,DOCTOR: It's worth the risk to find that pod. 
1160,(The Doctor swaps his hat for the chauffeur's cap.) 
1161,DOCTOR: How do I look? 
1162,(A car horn summons the watchman from his mediaeval looking stone hut
1163,to open a door in the gates and look out. Then he opens the gates
1164,themselves and the Doctor drives though. Sarah is hiding. The Doctor
1165,stops the car part way along the drive.) 
1166,"DOCTOR: So far, so good. "
1167,SARAH: Leave the car here? 
1168,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1169,(They walk through the ground until they get a view of the mansion
1170,proper.) 
1171,SARAH: We're here. 
1172,"DOCTOR: What's the best way in, do you think? "
1173,SARAH: The front. 
1174,DOCTOR: Not this time. 
1175,SARAH: The back? 
1176,"DOCTOR: The back. Quick, hide. "
1177,(Two black-clad guards with automatic weapons come strolling around a
1178,flowerbed.) 
1179,DOCTOR: Let's brazen it out. 
1180,(The Doctor and Sarah walk across the lawn.) 
1181,"GUARD: Hey, you! Halt, or I'll fire! "
1182,DOCTOR: Just act natural. 
1183,SARAH: I am. 
1184,"(They start to run just before the guard opens fire, and dash through a"
1185,"side gate to an inner garden with a cloverleaf pond, through to another"
1186,walled garden.) 
1187,"SARAH: Act natural, he says. "
1188,(They are stopped in the arboretum by Scorby.)

1192,them! 
1193,(The two guards come running.) 
1194,"DOCTOR: That's right, grab us. We're very dangerous. "
1195,"SCORBY: You're full of good ideas, Doctor. "
1196, [Library] 
1197, (The Doctor and Sarah are brought in at gunpoint.)
1198,
1199,"SCORBY: Some visitors, Mister Chase. "
1200,"CHASE: So, the meddling Doctor. You lead a charmed life. You arrive"
1201,"without a chauffeur, not even a touch of frostbite. "
1202,DOCTOR: How do you do. Have you met Miss Smith? She's my best friend. 
1203,"CHASE: Is she? And still beautifully intact, I see. "
1204,"SARAH: I try my best, under the circumstances. "
1205,DOCTOR: And this is Mister Scorby. I don't know his first name. And
1206,these two gentlemen 
1207,"CHASE: Yes, thank you, Doctor, we are acquainted. "
1208,DOCTOR: How nice. Hand over the pod. 
1209,"CHASE: After all the inconvenience I've been put to? Oh no, Doctor."
1210,"Perhaps you didn't know, but in this house is assembled the greatest"
1211,"collection of rare plants in the world. When the pod flowers, I shall"
1212,achieve the crowning glory of my life's work. 
1213,DOCTOR: Take care. I notice a little greenfly here and there. 
1214,"CHASE: Your envy is understandable, Doctor. However, as I propose to"
1215,have you both executed 
1216,SARAH: Why? We haven't harmed you. 
1217,"DOCTOR: Be reasonable, Sarah. What choice has he got? We keep"
1218,interfering. 
1219,"CHASE: Exactly, Doctor. However, before you die you will be granted a"
1220,unique privilege. The last things you will ever see will be my
1221,beautiful plants. Please come this way. 
1222,"SARAH: (sotto) Look, what are you playing "
1223,"SCORBY: Come on, on your way. "
1224, [Plant lab] 
1225, CHASE : And the west wing was completed by Sir
1226,Bothwell Chase just before his execution in 1587. 
1227,(They enter.) 
1228,"CHASE: This plant laboratory is unique, Doctor. It makes the Botanical"
1229,Institute look like a potting shed. 
1230,DOCTOR: Are we near the end? I do so hate guided tours. 
1231,"CHASE: Here we treat our green friends as patients. If they're puny, we"
1232,"build them up. If they're sick, we give them succour. "
1233,"SARAH: I've heard of flower power, but that is ridiculous. "
1234,CHASE: You've heard of the theory that irregular light patterns can
1235,affect the senses of so-called mindless things? 
1236,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, like Scorby here. "
1237,"SCORBY: Enjoy yourself while you can, Doctor. "

1246,KEELER: It's happening. 
1247,HARGREAVES: What is? 
1248,KEELER: There's a floccose path forming on the pericarp. 
1249,"HARGREAVES: There's a what, sir? "
1250,KEELER: It's alive! It's growing! Go and fetch Mister Chase. Tell him
1251,it's urgent. 
1252,"HARGREAVES: Hurry up, Hargreaves! "
1253, [Greenhouse]

1260,CHASE: The hymn of the plants. I composed it myself. People say that
1261,you should talk to plants. I believe that. Just as I believe they also
1262,like music. 
1263,SARAH: Got to get out of here. 
1264,DOCTOR: (mutters) 
1265,SARAH: What? 
1266,"DOCTOR: I said, the music's terrible! "
1267,SCORBY: Shut up.

1274,"DOCTOR: Oh, go away. Can't you see Mister Chase is busy? "
1275,HARGREAVES: It's Mister Keeler. Something's happening to that pod! 
1276,(Chase stops his noise.) 
1277,"CHASE: Why are you shouting, Hargreaves? "
1278,"HARGREAVES: Would you go to the annex, please? "
1279,"CHASE: Yes, right. Take these people away. I imagine they won't mind a"
1280,few minutes delay before they die. 
1281,"SCORBY: All right, move. "
1282, [Keeler's lab] 
1283, CHASE: What is it? 
1284,KEELER: I thought you should see this. 
1285,CHASE: Have you injected fixed nitrogen? 
1286,KEELER: Fifteen grams. Careful. I shouldn't get too close. 
1287,CHASE: There can't be any danger yet. 
1288,KEELER: Don't forget it's alien. 
1289,CHASE: More nitrogen. 
1290,"KEELER: No, I don't think that would be wise, Mister Chase. "
1291,CHASE: I make the decisions. Inject another fifteen grams.

1294,"SCORBY: I shouldn't worry, Doctor. It's strictly a one way journey. "

1298,"(The Doctor kicks the gun out of Scorby's hand then punches him, grabs"
1299,his head and twists it. There's a cracking sound.) 
1300,"DOCTOR: Come along, Sarah. "
1301,SARAH: But 
1302,(Scorby isn't dead. He gets up clutching his throat. Sarah pauses to
1303,close a decorative iron gate after they run through it.) 
1304,DOCTOR: We've got to warn Sir Colin. 
1305,SARAH: Right. Let's get out and phone him. 
1306,DOCTOR: Got a two P piece? 
1307,SARAH: Yeah. 
1308,DOCTOR: Good. You're going to phone him. I must get another look at
1309,that pod. Let's get you over the wall first. 
1310,(Scorby picks up his gun.) 
1311,SCORBY: Guards! 
1312,(Three guards arrive.) 
1313,SCORBY: They got away. We've got to find them. You two that way. 
1314,"(The Doctor and Sarah run up onto a terrace above a formal garden,"
1315,running along the main wall.) 
1316,SCORBY : You men there cover sector nine! 
1317,"(The Doctor looks down the tall ivy covered wall. Meanwhile, the"
1318,searchers meet at a statue of Queen Victoria.) 
1319,"SCORBY: Spread out, you idiots. "
1320,(The Doctor has found some rope and he ties it around Sarah's waist.) 
1321,DOCTOR: Come on. 
1322,"SARAH: Listen, you be careful of Chase. If he catches you. "
1323,DOCTOR: Shush. 
1324, [Keeler's lab] 
1325, (The lines between the pod's sections are even
1326,bigger. Keeler is cowering in a corner.) 
1327,CHASE: Remarkable. It almost grows before my eyes. Where's your
1328,"enthusiasm, Keeler? Don't you realise we face a moment of history? "
1329, [Grounds] 
1330, (The Doctor lowers Sarah down the inner curtain
1331,wall and she unties herself. The Doctor hides the rope in a nearby
1332,clipped yew and heads back to the house. A twig breaks and Sarah
1333,freezes. A guard grabs her from behind.) 
1334,"GUARD: One word out of you and you're a dead little girl, understand?"
1335,So near yet so far. 
1336,(The guard whistles and another comes out of the trees.) 
1337,"GUARD: You didn't think you'd get away with it, did you? Come on. "
1338,(The Doctor makes his way through the mansion. Scorby meets the guards
1339,by the building.) 
1340,GUARD: Found her in the woods. She must have got over the wall. 
1341,SCORBY: And the other one? 
1342,GUARD: No sign of him. 
1343,SCORBY: Where's the Doctor? Mister Chase isn't going to be very pleased
1344,with you. Come on. Keep looking! 
1345,(Scorby takes Sarah into the mansion.) 
1346, [Keeler's lab] 
1347, (The Doctor clambers through an attic and out onto
1348,"the roof, where he can peer down through the skylight into Keeler's"
1349,lab.) 
1350,KEELER: It's like waiting for a time bomb to explode. 
1351,(Scorby enters with Sarah.) 
1352,CHASE: What's been happening? I thought you had them both safely locked
1353,up. 
1354,SCORBY: They got away somehow. The Doctor's still free but he won't get
1355,far. 
1356,"CHASE: Oh, so that's what all that noise was about. Where is he? "
1357,"SARAH: I don't know. And if I did, I wouldn't tell you. "
1358,"CHASE: What a very uncooperative young lady. However, I've just had an"
1359,idea. You can help me with my experiment. Remove her coat. Sit down.
1360,"Miss Smith will be our subject, like so. "
1361,(Chase takes Sarah's bare arm and holds it on the table next to the
1362,pod.) 
1363,SARAH: No! 
1364,"CHASE: Fetch some clamps, Keeler. "
1365,KEELER: You can't! It's inhuman! 
1366,CHASE: I don't care. I must know what happens when a Krynoid touches
1367,human flesh. 
1368,"(As the Doctor stares down into the room, the pod begins to open.) "
1369, Part Four
1370,
1371, [Keeler's lab] 
1372, (The Doctor jumps down through the skylight. Chase
1373,"lets go of Sarah's arm as the Doctor knocks out Scorby, smashing a"
1374,chair over his back then picking up the gun.) 
1375,"CHASE: What do you do for an encore, Doctor? "
1376,DOCTOR: I win. 
1377,"(The Doctor grabs Sarah and they run from the room, locking the door"
1378,behind them. Chase hammers on it.) 
1379,CHASE: Open this door! Guards! Guards! 
1380,(Scorby gets out of the fireplace.) 
1381,CHASE: Why am I surrounded by idiots! Guards! 
1382,"(The Krynoid tendril is flailing around, looking for something to latch"
1383,on to. It finds Keeler.) 
1384,KEELER: Argh! My arm! My arm! 
1385,CHASE: Keeler! It's happened. 
1386,(A guard runs in.) 
1387,GUARD: What's up? 
1388,SCORBY: The Doctor and the girl. Come on! 
1389,(Scorby and the guard leave.) 
1390, [Gardens] 
1391, DOCTOR: Get in there and hide. I'll be as quick as
1392,I can. 
1393,SARAH: You can't tackle them single-handed. 
1394,DOCTOR: Why not? I've got a pistol. 
1395,SARAH: But you'd never use it. 
1396,"DOCTOR: True, but they don't know that, do they. "
1397,(Sarah backs into a small stone archway.) 
1398, [Keeler's lab] 
1399, (Keeler's skin is already green. He starts to
1400,undress.) 
1401,CHASE: Amazing. 
1402,"KEELER: My whole body's changing. Look at my arm. Get me to a hospital,"
1403,please. 
1404,CHASE: Don't be ridiculous. We'll look after you here. 
1405,KEELER: Do something. You must do something. 
1406,CHASE: It's incredible. Absolutely unique. 
1407,"KEELER: For pity's sake, help me. "
1408,"(Scorby follows the Doctor through the mansion. Meanwhile, Hargreaves"
1409,the butler enters and sees all the broken glass.) 
1410,"HARGREAVES: What's all this? Oh sir, I hear Mister Keeler "
1411,CHASE: Mister Keeler is not very well. 
1412,HARGREAVES: Mister Keeler! 
1413,CHASE: We must get him over to the cottage where we can look after him
1414,properly. 
1415,"HARGREAVES: What happened, sir? "
1416,"CHASE: Don't ask questions, just do it. "
1417, [Courtyard] 
1418," (As the guards run past Sarah's hiding place,"
1419,Hargreaves and Chase half-carry Keeler out of the main house.) 
1420,"CHASE: Bear up, Keeler. "
1421, [Keeler's lab] 
1422, DOCTOR: Nobody move. 
1423,(He puts the gun down and goes over to the empty pod. Scorby enters
1424,behind him.) 
1425,SCORBY: How predictable. The criminal returns to the scene of the
1426,crime. 
1427,DOCTOR: I see the pod's burst. Was anyone in the way? 
1428,"SCORBY: Yeah, Keeler. Very clumsy of him. Where's the girl? "
1429,"DOCTOR: You're working for a madman, Scorby, you know that? "
1430,"SCORBY: He pays well. And when it comes to money, Mister Chase and I"
1431,are of the same religion. 
1432,"DOCTOR: Franklin Adams, 1881 to 1960. American humourist. "
1433,"SCORBY: The quotes are over, Doctor. Miss Smith'll never get out of"
1434,"this place alive, and neither will you. "
1435,(Scorby puts the Doctor's gun in his pocket.) 
1436,"SCORBY: Now, this way. And this time don't try anything. "
1437,DOCTOR: You know 
1438,SCORBY: Not anything! 
1439,(Hargreaves unlocks a small white-washed thatched cottage and they
1440,carry Keeler inside.) 
1441, [Compost room] 
1442, (Scorby pushes the Doctor into a containing a lot
1443,of dustbins.) 
1444,SCORBY: Turn around. 
1445,"DOCTOR: Can't we talk this over, Scorby? "
1446,"SCORBY: You're getting a bit unsteady on your feet, Doctor. "
1447,"(As he pushes him into the dustbins, knocking the breath out of him.) "
1448,"DOCTOR: You're pushing your luck, Scorby. "
1449,"SCORBY: Take a seat, Doctor. "
1450,(Scorby goes over to a machine with a hopper and conveyer belt leading
1451,to a large toothed crusher made of giant cogwheels.) 
1452,"SCORBY: You see our little machine, Doctor? "
1453,DOCTOR: Looks as if it's got possibilities. 
1454,"SCORBY: Oh yes, it has. Distinct possibilities. Did you know we made"
1455,our own compost? 
1456,DOCTOR: Quite right. Always put back in the soil what you take out. 
1457,SCORBY: Just what Mister Chase says. He never wastes anything that can
1458,be used to fertilise his plants. Anything. 
1459,DOCTOR: That's very commendable. 
1460,(Scorby takes a machine gun from a guard and turns on the machine. The
1461,two crushing cogs turn.) 
1462,"SCORBY: It's got a very healthy appetite, Doctor. Tie him up. "
1463, [Cottage] 
1464, (Night has fallen. Sarah comes out of her hiding
1465,"place. Tied down to the cottage bed, Keeler is now mostly plant.) "
1466,KEELER: What's happening? What have you done? 
1467,CHASE: It's for your own good. You mustn't move. 
1468,KEELER: You can't keep me here. I need medical attention! Look at me. 
1469,"CHASE: The rate of increase is astonishing. Remarkable, Keeler. Protein"
1470,"absorption from the animal, of course. "
1471,KEELER: What animal? 
1472,CHASE: Your own body. We shall have to give you some food soon. 
1473,"KEELER: Chase, stop behaving like a maniac and get me to hospital. "
1474,"CHASE: Don't be ridiculous. That would ruin everything. Together, we"
1475,could be on the verge of a great scientific discovery. We must observe
1476,the process carefully. 
1477,"KEELER: Hargreaves, don't listen to him. This is murder. "
1478,"HARGREAVES: I'm sure Mister Chase is right, sir. And it's for your own"
1479,good. 
1480,"CHASE: You're changing into a plant, Keeler. You're privileged. Think"
1481,"of it, a marvellous new species of plant. I shall need some equipment"
1482,to monitor this experiment. 
1483,(Chase and Hargreaves leave.) 
1484,KEELER: Chase! 
1485, [Outside the cottage] 
1486, (Sarah sees the two men come out.) 
1487,"HARGREAVES: He might be right, sir. It could be dangerous. "
1488,"CHASE: Everything will be all right, Hargreaves, just as long as we"
1489,keep him in there. 
1490,"HARGREAVES: Very good, sir. "
1491, [Plant lab] 
1492," SCORBY: Ah, there you are, Mister Chase. We've got"
1493,the Doctor. I've locked him in the compost room. 
1494,CHASE: Good. No sign of the girl? 
1495,"SCORBY: No, not yet. We've got all the exits covered. She won't get"
1496,far. 
1497,(The telephone rings. Hargreaves puts down a microscope and goes to
1498,answer it.) 
1499,"HARGREAVES: General laboratory. What? Oh, hold on. It's for you, sir."
1500,Says it's urgent. Main gate. 
1501,(Chase takes the telephone.) 
1502,CHASE: Chase. Amelia Ducat? Why'd you let her past the main gate? 
1503, [Gatehouse] 
1504," WATCHMAN: Sorry, sir. Miss Ducat insists on seeing"
1505,"you. Says you owe her money. Well that's what she says, sir. "
1506, [Plant lab] 
1507, CHASE: Well get rid of her. I'm in the middle of
1508,some very important work and I can see no one. Is that clear? 
1509, [Gatehouse] 
1510," WATCHMAN: I've told her all about that, Mister"
1511,"Chase, but she's very, er, persistent. She's mentioned something about"
1512,"lawyers, sir. "
1513, [Plant lab] 
1514, CHASE: Lawyers? (covers the handset) Man's a fool.
1515,Why am I surrounded by idiots? 
1516,"SCORBY: Wouldn't it be better to see her, Mister Chase, and avoid any"
1517,fuss? 
1518,"CHASE: It might, and it might not. (into telephone) Have someone bring"
1519,her up to the library. 
1520, [Cottage] 
1521," (Sarah sneaks in, and hears noises upstairs. She"
1522,climbs the stairs to the bedroom.) 
1523,"KEELER: Don't be frightened. You should be glad. After all, it might"
1524,have been you. 
1525,SARAH: Keeler? What have they done to you? 
1526,"KEELER: Disgusting, isn't it. Aren't you scared? "
1527,"SARAH: No, I'm not scared. Why are they keeping you here? "
1528,KEELER: Chase. Chase owns me body and soul. Body. This must be how
1529,"Winlett changed. You saw him at the base, didn't you. What was it like?"
1530,You've got to tell me. 
1531,SARAH: I'm going to find the Doctor. He knows more about this than
1532,"anyone else. Now, do you know where he is? "
1533,KEELER: I might. Let me loose and we'll go together. 
1534,SARAH: I can't. 
1535,KEELER: I won't harm you. 
1536,"SARAH: You mightn't mean to, but you would. "
1537,KEELER: You're as bad as Chase and the others. You want me to die! You
1538,want me to die! You want me to die! 
1539,(Sarah hides in a cupboard and Hargreaves enters with a plate of food.)
1540,
1541,"HARGREAVES: Mister Keeler, try not to distress yourself. Mister Chase"
1542,"ordered this meal for you, sir. "
1543, [Library] 
1544," (Amelia is sitting by a roaring log fire, puffing"
1545,"on a cigarillo, when Chase enters.) "
1546,"CHASE: Good evening, Miss Ducat. "
1547,"AMELIA: Good evening, Mister Chase. I'm sorry to have insisted on"
1548,seeing you at this hour. 
1549,"CHASE: Not at all. It's a great pleasure, indeed an honour, to see you"
1550,again. 
1551,AMELIA: I was visiting Lady Chandley nearby. Painting a rare hibiscus
1552,in her conservatory. 
1553,"CHASE: Ah yes, the Venezuelan gobbo. I have several of the species. "
1554,"AMELIA: Of course, your collection of plants is unrivalled. Even the"
1555,short safari from the gate is simply packed with interest. 
1556,"CHASE: What a shame you should come in the autumn. In high summer, ah. "
1557,"AMELIA: Even so, I think I could set up my easel here to good purpose. "
1558,"CHASE: At any other time I'd be very happy for you to do so, but just"
1559,at the moment I have some very pressing business. 
1560,AMELIA: What a pity. Never mind. The real reason for my coming won't
1561,take up much of your time. 
1562,"CHASE: Yes, it seems I neglected to pay you for a painting I had from"
1563,you. 
1564,AMELIA: Yes. 
1565,CHASE: I offer you my humblest apologies. 
1566,AMELIA: Seven hundred and fifty guineas. 
1567,CHASE: Guineas? 
1568,AMELIA: Plus inflation. Shall we say a round thousand? 
1569,CHASE: Pounds. 
1570,AMELIA: Done. 
1571,CHASE: I'll write you a cheque now. 
1572,"AMELIA: Magnificent house you have here, Mister Chase. "
1573,"CHASE: Yes, it is rather fine, isn't it. Most of it was built during"
1574,"the Wars of the Roses. Charmingly named, but rather a bloodthirsty"
1575,"period in history, I always think. "
1576,(Scorby enters.) 
1577,SCORBY: Do you want to start the (pause as he sees Amelia) recycling
1578,"experiment, Mister Chase? "
1579,CHASE: No. I want to see it. I'll be right there. 
1580,(Chase tears the cheque out of his book and hands it to Amelia.) 
1581,CHASE: I apologise for the delay. 
1582,AMELIA: Thank you. 
1583,CHASE: Mister Scorby will see you out. 
1584,AMELIA: What is this recycling experiment? Sounds interesting. 
1585,"CHASE: Yes, I'm afraid it's something we're keeping rather quiet about"
1586,just for the moment. Within these grounds there are several private
1587,projects going on. 
1588,AMELIA: Oh. 
1589,"SCORBY: This way, madam. "
1590,AMELIA: Goodbye. 
1591,(In the cottage Hargreaves leaves Keeler after he has been fed. Sarah
1592,comes out of the cupboard and leaves too.) 
1593, [Compost room] 
1594, (The giant cogwheels are still turning when Chase
1595,enters.) 
1596,CHASE: So sorry to have kept you waiting. 
1597,"DOCTOR: Not at all, not at all. "
1598,CHASE: I do hope you haven't been bored. 
1599,"DOCTOR: Oh no, I've been watching your little toy. It's most efficient."
1600,
1601,"CHASE: Yes, isn't it. The problem is keeping it stocked up. "
1602,(Chase turns the machine off.) 
1603,"DOCTOR: Yes, at the moment it's working on an empty stomach. "
1604,"CHASE: The next time it starts, we must give it something to bite on."
1605,You've noticed how lush the grounds are? 
1606,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. "
1607,CHASE: This is the secret. We put everything into the grinder. Every
1608,"scrap of food and garden waste, lots of other things. Provided they're"
1609,organic. 
1610,DOCTOR: I'm sure you're noted for your tidiness. How is Keeler? 
1611,CHASE: Dear Arnold. A brilliant researcher and a dedicated botanist.
1612,"And now, properly nurtured, he can be of inestimable value to science. "
1613,DOCTOR: Nurtured. You don't mean to say you've been feeding him? 
1614, [Corridor] 
1615, (Sarah hides behind a suit of armour as Scorby
1616,shows Amelia through a door.) 
1617,AMELIA: It is a fascinating house. The mixture of styles is charming.
1618,"This corridor must be early sixteenth century, is it not? "
1619,"SCORBY: I'm sorry, history isn't my strong point. Would you mind coming"
1620,"this way, please? "
1621,(Scorby walks off round a corner and a guard meets him.) 
1622,GUARD: We've covered the south and west sections. There's no sign of
1623,the girl. 
1624,"SCORBY: Yes, all right, thank you. (to Amelia) Sorry, we're just doing"
1625,a bit of a security exercise. Would you excuse me a moment? A word in
1626,your ear. 
1627,(Scorby leads the guard away. Back around the corner...) 
1628,SARAH: Psst! Miss Ducat! Please. 
1629,"AMELIA: My dear child, are you all right? "
1630,SARAH: That man Scorby mustn't see me. I'm trying to find the Doctor. 
1631,AMELIA: What's happening? 
1632,SARAH: Will you tell Sir Colin Thackeray at the World Ecology Bureau
1633,that we've found the pod but we're trapped here. Please? 
1634,(Scorby appears.) 
1635,SCORBY: Were you talking to someone? 
1636,AMELIA: Talking? 
1637,SCORBY: I thought I heard voices. 
1638,AMELIA: That must have been me. I'm always talking to myself. It's old
1639,"age, you know. Happens to us all. Er, this is the way out, is it not? "
1640,"SCORBY: Er, yeah, just go straight "
1641, [Compost room] 
1642, (The Doctor has been tied up by a guard and put on
1643,the conveyor belt feet first.) 
1644,"CHASE: Right, get out. "
1645,(The guard leaves.) 
1646,"CHASE: I shall set the machine on automatic control, which means it"
1647,will start up again in a few minutes time. Your death will be
1648,"agonising, Doctor, but mercifully quick. "
1649,DOCTOR: What can I say? 
1650,CHASE: Blood and bone contain the most valuable nitrogen elements. Just
1651,"think. After shredding, your remains will pass automatically through my"
1652,compost acceleration chamber and within twenty five minutes you will be
1653,pumped into the garden to become part of nature's grand design. 
1654,DOCTOR: I still can't think of anything to say. 
1655, [Country lane] 
1656, (Amelia walks up to a parked car. One man gets out
1657,and opens the door for her.) 
1658,AMELIA: Very kind. There we are. 
1659,"THACKERAY: Well, what happened? "
1660,"AMELIA: You were quite right, Sir Colin. The girl and the Doctor have"
1661,run into trouble. 
1662,THACKERAY: And did Chase suspect anything? 
1663,AMELIA: I think not. The debt for my picture was a splendid excuse. 
1664,DUNBAR: You saw the Doctor? 
1665,"AMELIA: No, but I saw Miss Smith. They've found the pod but they're"
1666,both trapped in the house. 
1667,"THACKERAY: So Chase is behind this, after all. "
1668,"AMELIA: Well, it would seem so. What are you going to do to help them? "
1669,THACKERAY: We'd better alert the Doctor's friends at UNIT. This is
1670,getting too big for us. 
1671,"DUNBAR: No, wait. Let me go in alone. "
1672,THACKERAY: You'll never get past the gate. 
1673,"DUNBAR: Yes, I will. They know me already. "
1674,THACKERAY: What do you mean? 
1675,"DUNBAR: I've made a terrible mistake, Sir Colin. It's my duty to try"
1676,and save the situation. 
1677,THACKERAY: I don't understand. 
1678,"DUNBAR: Give me half an hour. If I'm not back by then, return to London"
1679,and contact UNIT. 
1680, [Cottage] 
1681, (Hargreaves enters with another plate of protein.)
1682,
1683,"HARGREAVES: Now, Mister Keeler "
1684,(But Keeler is now fully Krynoid. Hargreaves drops the plate and flees.
1685,The plant breaks the ropes and gets out of the bed.) 
1686, [Compost room] 
1687, (The conveyor is starting to move the Doctor
1688,towards the grinders when Sarah enters.) 
1689,SARAH: Doctor! 
1690,"DOCTOR: Quick, Sarah, the button! "
1691,"(But she starts at the wrong end of the control box, and speeds things"
1692,up instead.) 
1693,"DOCTOR: Not that button, the other one! "
1694,(She stops the conveyer and the back of the hopper opens as she leaps
1695,in to untie the Doctor.) 
1696,SARAH: Are you all right? 
1697,"DOCTOR: Oh, Sarah. "
1698,SARAH: What? 
1699,DOCTOR: It would have been such a waste! 
1700, [Library] 
1701, DUNBAR: I warned you not to go too far. You must
1702,"abandon the experiment, destroy that abomination. "
1703,CHASE: The search for knowledge knows no boundaries. This is the most
1704,valuable study in plant biology ever made. Nothing will stop me now. I
1705,will cultivate the Krynoid. 
1706,(Hargreaves bursts in.) 
1707,"HARGREAVES: Mister Chase! Mister Chase, that thing in the cottage, it's"
1708,a monster! It's breaking loose. 
1709,CHASE: What? 
1710,"HARGREAVES: The ropes, they're not going to hold it. "
1711,DUNBAR: You mean that horror could be roaming around? 
1712,HARGREAVES: It could be in the grounds by now. 
1713,DUNBAR: I'm going for help. If that thing's free it will kill us all. 
1714,CHASE: I would prefer it if you kept your mouth shut. 
1715,"DUNBAR: No, it's all gone far enough. I'm going for help. "
1716,CHASE: You won't get past the guards. 
1717,(Dunbar produces a gun.) 
1718,
1719,DUNBAR: We'll see. 
1720,(Dunbar leaves.) 
1721,CHASE: Scorby! Get Dunbar! 
1722, [Cottage] 
1723, (As Scorby chases Dunbar through the various
1724,"courtyards and outbuildings of the estate, the Doctor and Sarah go to"
1725,the bedroom.) 
1726,SARAH: It's gone! 
1727,"DOCTOR: Yes, but where? "
1728,"(Downstairs, the Doctor takes a sword from over the fireplace before"
1729,they leave.) 
1730, [Grounds] 
1731," (In amongst the shrubs, Dunbar nearly runs into"
1732,"the Krynoid, now thick as a tree. He tries shooting at it to no avail,"
1733,then falls over. The Doctor and Sarah hear the shots. Sarah picks up a
1734,stout branch. Scorby and the guards are also closing in. Then Dunbar
1735,screams. The Doctor and Sarah arrive on the scene to see the alien
1736,plant towering over Dunbar's body. The Doctor tries stabbing at it with
1737,the sword as Sarah screams. It advances on them.) 
1738, Part Five
1739,
1740, [Grounds] 
1741," (Scorby and the guards arrive, and start shooting,"
1742,distracting the Krynoid away from the Doctor and Sarah.) 
1743,SARAH: Run! 
1744,"DOCTOR: Come on, don't waste your bullets! "
1745,(Scorby and the guards follow them.) 
1746, [Cottage] 
1747, DOCTOR: Block the door. 
1748,"SCORBY: Yeah, come on. "
1749,(They push a two seater settee in front of the door.) 
1750,DOCTOR: Quietly! 
1751,"SCORBY: How do you do it, Doctor? You should be compost by now. "
1752,DOCTOR: We'll all be compost if we don't keep away from that Krynoid. 
1753,SCORBY: Krynoid? Is that what that thing is? 
1754,"SARAH: Yes. It used to be called Keeler. Remember Keeler, your friend?"
1755,Now do you see what we're up against? 
1756,SCORBY: That's Keeler? 
1757,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1758,(Scorby's walkie-talkie beeps. He answers it.) 
1759,SCORBY: Yeah. 
1760,"CHASE : Scorby, what was that firing? "
1761,"SCORBY: That Krynoid thing, Mister Chase. It's got us trapped in the"
1762,cottage. 
1763, [Plant lab] 
1764," CHASE: You idiots. Listen to me. Whatever happens,"
1765,it must not be harmed. Is that clear? 
1766, [Cottage] 
1767," SCORBY: Mister Chase, you don't understand. It's"
1768,eight foot high and its already killed Dunbar. 
1769, [Plant lab] 
1770, CHASE: I don't care who it's killed. People are
1771,"replaceable, Scorby. The Krynoid is unique. It must not be damaged in"
1772,any way. That's an order. 
1773, [Cottage] 
1774," SCORBY: Mister Chase, I am not getting through to"
1775,you 
1776,"DOCTOR: Give it to me. Chase, try and understand one thing. The Krynoid"
1777,is an uncontrollable carnivore that's getting bigger and more powerful
1778,by the minute. Now (beep) Chase? Chase! Arrogant fool. 
1779,(The Doctor goes to the window.) 
1780,SARAH: Where is it now? 
1781,DOCTOR: I don't know. 
1782,SARAH: What are we going to do? 
1783,SCORBY: Is it going to keep on growing? How big's it going to get? 
1784,"DOCTOR: Oh, about the size of Saint Paul's Cathedral. After that, it'll"
1785,multiply itself a thousand-fold until it takes over your entire planet.
1786,
1787,(A tentacle smashes through a rear window.) 
1788,SCORBY: Get back! Stay back! 
1789,"(Scorby dashes up the stairs, shooting. Sarah uses an axe from the log"
1790,basket but is pushed away by the tentacle. The Doctor jabs with his
1791,sword and it eventually withdraws.) 
1792,"DOCTOR: You don't scare us, Keeler. You hear? You don't scare us! (to"
1793,Scorby) Do you think he believed us? 
1794,KRYNOID : The human was Keeler. Now us. Now belongs. 
1795,SARAH: It speaks! 
1796,DOCTOR: It can think. 
1797,"KRYNOID : You, Doctor. Come out now. Join us. "
1798,"SCORBY: You seem to have been singled out for special attention,"
1799,Doctor. 
1800,SARAH: It's afraid he'll find a way to destroy it. 
1801,"DOCTOR: Yes. It does seem to sense my knowledge of alien species,"
1802,particularly the Krynoid. 
1803,KRYNOID : Send the Doctor to us. Your lives will then be spared. 
1804,"SCORBY: You'd better think of something pretty quickly, hadn't you,"
1805,Doctor. 
1806,"DOCTOR: Oh, Scorby, take no notice of it. I've heard that one before. "
1807,"SCORBY: It sounds a pretty fair deal to me. How about it, Doctor? You'd"
1808,"lay down your life for others, wouldn't you? "
1809,SARAH: Not to save your skin. Not after what you did to us. 
1810,SCORBY: This is different. 
1811,SARAH: Why is it different? 
1812,"SCORBY: He'd be sacrificing himself for you, for all of us. "
1813,"SARAH: What, because you're involved, it's your life "
1814,DOCTOR: Excuse me! Would you mind if I said something? 
1815,"SARAH: And you'd better listen, because nobody else knows how to fight"
1816,that creature. 
1817,"KRYNOID : Hear this, humans. You have till daybreak to deliver the"
1818,Doctor. 
1819,SCORBY: Why wait? Why not now? 
1820,"DOCTOR: Scorby, if I die, you die. "
1821,SCORBY: I'll take a chance on that. 
1822,DOCTOR: There is no chance! By daybreak the Krynoid'll be large enough
1823,to crush this entire cottage to rubble. If I could get outside there'd
1824,be some hope for all of us. 
1825,SCORBY: Why don't I just throw you out? 
1826,"DOCTOR: It would make no difference! We need a bomb. Scorby, could you"
1827,make a bomb? Could you make a fire bomb of some kind? 
1828,SCORBY: What for? 
1829,DOCTOR: To distract the Krynoid while we all slip away. 
1830,SCORBY: Molotoff cocktail? 
1831,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's a good idea. "
1832,"SCORBY: Okay, leave it to me. You keep watch. "

1834,window.)

1839,"THACKERAY: Come on, come on. Not exactly rushing themselves, are they. "
1840,AMELIA: Perhaps we should have gone back into the grounds? 
1841,THACKERAY: Too dangerous. I wonder what has happened to Dunbar? 
1842,"AMELIA: Mmm. Of course, there were these armed men running about. "
1843,THACKERAY: Must have been quite terrifying. 
1844,"AMELIA: Not a bit. I enjoyed it. I like a little excitement. Besides, I"
1845,"have some wartime experience, you know. Oh yes. I was a sergeant in the"
1846,ATS. Manned an ack-ack gun at Folkestone. 
1847,"THACKERAY: Indeed. (into phone) Yes, yes. This is Sir Colin Thackeray."
1848,I am aware that the Brigadier is in Geneva. I must speak to a senior
1849,"officer. This is a matter of national security. Yes, national security."
1850,
1851,AMELIA: Invent a codeword. They love that. What about Operation
1852,Nuthouse? 
1853,"THACKERAY: What, Major Beresford? Well, right, get him down here fast!"
1854,Thank you! 
1855,(Thackeray puts the phone down.) 
1856,AMELIA: Bravo. 
1857,THACKERAY: What a nit-wit. 
1858,"AMELIA: That's the stuff to give 'em. After all, our taxes pay for"
1859,these wretched civil servants and you can never get hold of them when
1860,"you want them, can you. "
1861,"THACKERAY: I'm a civil servant, Miss Ducat. "
1862,"AMELIA: Then you know exactly what I mean, of course. "
1863,"THACKERAY: Of course. Well now, I think it's time you ran along and got"
1864,some sleep. 
1865,"AMELIA: Oh, I'm not sleepy. "
1866,THACKERAY: Thank you very much for all you've done. 
1867,AMELIA: Not at all. I do hope you'll be able to get some help to the
1868,"Doctor and that dear child, that little girl "
1869,THACKERAY: Yes. 
1870,AMELIA: Before it's too late. 
1871,"THACKERAY: We'll do our best. Yes, thank you. "

1878,"CHASE: Botanical history, Hargreaves. These'll be the first pictures"
1879,ever taken of an alien organism. 
1880,"HARGREAVES: That thing, sir. You will be careful, won't you? "
1881,CHASE: Why? I have nothing to fear from the Krynoid. 
1882, [Cottage] 
1883," DOCTOR: Scorby, can I rely on you? "
1884,"SCORBY: For the moment, Doctor. "
1885,(Scorby finishes putting a wick into a partly filled milk bottle.) 
1886,SCORBY: I'll check the position of the Krynoid. 
1887,(Scorby goes upstairs. The Doctor gestures the guards to move the
1888,settee from the door.) 
1889,DOCTOR: Clear this door. Quietly! 
1890,(Chase walks along a tall hedge then sees the Krynoid towering over the
1891,cottage.) 
1892,SCORBY: Stand by. 
1893,(He lights the wick then throws the bottle out of the bedroom window at
1894,the Krynoid. The Doctor runs out of the front door.)

1897,(The Krynoid lumbers after the Doctor.) 
1898, [Cottage] 
1899," SARAH: Okay, it worked. It's gone after him. "
1900,"SCORBY: Okay, let's go. "
1901,"(Scorby, Sarah and the guards leave. The Doctor sprints to the driveway"
1902,"where he left the Daimler, climbs in and drives away.) "
1903, [Greenhouse and plant lab] 
1904, SCORBY: Chase! Any sign? 
1905,SARAH: No. 
1906,"SCORBY: Hargreaves, come here. Where's Chase? "
1907,HARGREAVES: Mister Chase has gone out to take some photographs. 
1908,"SCORBY: Photographs? What's he playing at? Well, listen. I've posted"
1909,lookouts but they're not going to stay very long. Get over to the
1910,"workshop, help get some timber. We've got to board up all these ground"
1911,floor windows. 
1912,HARGREAVES: If you say so. 
1913,"SARAH: Well, I heard the car move off, so the Doctor must have got"
1914,away. 
1915,"SCORBY: He's no fool, your friend. He's escaped, we're still trapped. "
1916,SARAH: But he went to get help. You know he went to get help. You were
1917,there. 
1918,SCORBY: Sure. 
1919,SARAH: Listen. The Doctor's not just concerned about saving his own
1920,"skin. He's risked his life before for others. Unlike you, he has"
1921,principles. 
1922,"SCORBY: Oh, yeah? Well you listen to me. Now there's just the two of"
1923,"us, so you've got to rely on me. So don't push your luck, because if"
1924,"you do, I'll start again exactly where I left off. Understood? "
1925,"SARAH: You're as mad as Chase, Scorby. Other people don't matter. All"
1926,"these guards, all these guns, it's just a big game to you, isn't it?"
1927,Gives you a sense of power. You're not complete unless you've got a gun
1928,in your hand. 
1929, [Grounds] 
1930, (Chase finds a good view of the Krynoid by an ivy
1931,"covered tree, and starts taking his picture. The plant moves closer,"
1932,and he has to angle the camera ever higher until he realises just how
1933,close it has got.) 
1934,"CHASE: No. No, not me. I want to help. Keeler, you know me. I want to"
1935,help you. 
1936,(The bulk of the Krynoid blocks out the light.)

1938, (The Doctor parks the Daimler in a No Parking
1939,space and runs inside the WEB.) 
1940,"BERESFORD: Sir Colin, you do understand that without clear evidence I"
1941,will not mount a raid on someone's private property. 
1942,"THACKERAY: I agree. Without further evidence, we're stuck. "
1943,"(The Doctor bursts in with a piece of paper in his hand, followed by a"

1947,MAN: Really!

1949,"DOCTOR: What have you decided, Major Beresford? "
1950,"BERESFORD: Doctor, I've been telling Sir Colin that without the proper"
1951,authority I will not mount a raid on someone's private property. 
1952,"DOCTOR: Waffle! Waffle, waffle, waffle! Where's the Brigadier? "
1953,(The telephone beeps and the Doctor answers it.) 
1954,DOCTOR: He's busy. 
1955,THACKERAY: He's in Geneva. 
1956,BERESFORD: I'm deputising. 
1957,DOCTOR: And you can't act without authority. 
1958,"BERESFORD: Look, I'm in a very difficult position. What exactly is"
1959,going on down there? 
1960,DOCTOR: Revolution's going on down there. 
1961,"THACKERAY: Revolution. Come now, Doctor. Are you choosing your words"
1962,with care? 
1963,DOCTOR: Somehow the Krynoid can channel its power to other plants. All
1964,the vegetation on this planet is about to turn hostile. 
1965,THACKERAY: You mean like aggressive rhubarb? 
1966,"DOCTOR: Yes, aggressive rhubarb. "
1967,BERESFORD: What about homicidal gooseberries? 
1968,"THACKERAY: You are joking, of course, Doctor. "
1969,"DOCTOR: No, I'm not joking. Read this report. I just snatched it from"
1970,"your secretary. Go on, read it. Aloud. "

1976,DOCTOR: This bit. 
1977,BERESFORD: And all within a mile of Chase's estate.

1983,"SARAH: Oh, Doctor. You all right? So, what's happening? "
1984, [Thackeray's office] 
1985, DOCTOR: Things are moving at last. Sir Colin's
1986,seen the light and Major Beresford's getting a laser gun team together.
1987,That should stop the Krynoid. I'm on my way back with a Sergeant
1988,Henderson. 
1989, [Plant lab] 
1990," SARAH: Well, make it soon. The Krynoid's still"
1991,"lurking around outside the house somewhere. Scorby? Oh, don't worry,"
1992,"we're great friends. Well, uneasy allies. "
1993,(A vine clambers up the roof and rips out the telephone line.) 
1994,SARAH: Doctor? Doctor? Hello? Doctor!

2003,"SARAH: I was talking to the Doctor, the line went dead and those vines"
2004,smashed the panes. 
2005,"SCORBY: Oh, come on. "
2006,"SARAH: No, look, they are getting thicker. "
2007,"SCORBY: Yeah, you're right. They're only plants. "
2008,SARAH: So how did the glass break? 
2009,SCORBY: How am I supposed to know? Maybe it was the ghost of Sir
2010,Bothwell Chase. He's supposed to haunt this place. 
2011,SARAH: Why can't you believe me? 
2012,"SCORBY: Because it doesn't make sense, that's why. "
2013,(More breaking glass.) 
2014,SARAH: It's the Krynoid. It's controlling them. 
2015,SCORBY: How can it? 
2016,"SARAH: I don't know. The Doctor will, and he's on his way back. Yes,"
2017,"that surprises you, doesn't it, even more than the Krynoid. But it's"
2018,"true. Have a little faith, Scorby. "
2019,(Hargreaves enters.) 
2020,"HARGREAVES: Scorby, all the guards have left. I think they've made a"
2021,run for it. 
2022,SCORBY: Typical. Just like a bunch of women. 
2023,HARGREAVES: And I heard screams from the west garden but I didn't go
2024,out. 
2025,SARAH: Let's take a look. 
2026,"SCORBY: Look, we'd better stay put. "
2027,SARAH: He just said he heard a scream. Obviously someone is in trouble.
2028,
2029,"SCORBY: Well, what can we do with that thing roaming about out there? "
2030,SARAH: What was that you just said about women? 
2031, [Grounds] 
2032, (Sarah and Scorby find a man wrapped in a plant.) 
2033,SCORBY: He's been strangled by the vine. 
2034,"SARAH: Oh come on, Doctor. Where are you? "
2035,CHASE: I've taken some fascinating photographs. Quite fascinating. 
2036,"SCORBY: Look, we're in real trouble. These plants are taking over. "
2037,CHASE: And why not? It's their world. We're merely parasites. I must
2038,get these photographs developed. 
2039,(Chase leaves.) 
2040,SCORBY: He's out of his head. He's really gone. 
2041,"SARAH: He must have been gone for years, if you ask me. "

2051,before Scorby and Sarah enter.)

2053,HARGREAVES: He's in there. I believe he's talking to his plants. 
2054,SCORBY: I don't care about that. Get out of the way. 
2055, [Greenhouse] 
2056, SCORBY: Chase! 
2057,CHASE: We shall have perfection. The world will be as it should have
2058,"been from the beginning, a green paradise. "
2059,(Scorby turns off the 'music' and goes over to Chase.) 
2060,"SCORBY: Chase, listen to me. "
2061,"CHASE: A harmony of root, stem, leaf, flower. "
2062,SCORBY: Chase! 
2063,SARAH: It's no good. He can't hear you. 
2064,SCORBY: What's the matter with him? 
2065,HARGREAVES: He's not himself. 
2066,SARAH: He's in some sort of a trance. 
2067,"SCORBY: Chase, you've got to listen to me. If we don't do something,"
2068,we're going to be trapped here. Those precious plants of yours are
2069,starting to kill people. 
2070,CHASE: The time has come. Animals have ruled this planet for millions
2071,of years. Now it is our turn. 
2072,"SCORBY: What do you mean, your turn? You're one of us, Chase. "
2073,"SARAH: He's not. At least, not in his mind. You hate us, don't you? "
2074,CHASE: Of course. Animals are the enemy. 
2075,SARAH: You want to see us all die. 
2076,CHASE: It is only a matter of time. 
2077,"SCORBY: Come on, Hargreaves, we've got to lock him away. "
2078,"HARGREAVES: Scorby, he's ill! Leave him alone. "
2079,"SARAH: Scorby, they're moving. The plants, they're moving! "
2080,"(Greenery starts to spread over the walkway behind them. Meanwhile, a"
2081,UNIT sergeant opens the main gates and the Daimler drives through. Back
2082,"in the greenhouse, Sarah, Hargreaves and Scorby are being smothered by"
2083,plants while Chase sits and smiles.) 
2084,"CHASE: Don't resist us, Scorby. You must die. All plant eaters must"
2085,die.

2100,"(Chase struggles with Henderson, who easily pushes him away.) "
2101,"CHASE: You'll pay for this, animal fiends! "
2102,(Chase leaves. The Doctor pulls dead foliage off Sarah and helps her to
2103,her feet.) 
2104,DOCTOR: Come on. 
2105,(Scorby gets out too.) 
2106,"HENDERSON: This one's dead, Doctor. "
2107,"DOCTOR: Come on, let's get out of here. "
2108,(They leave Hargreaves in the plants.) 
2109, [Plant lab] 
2110, DOCTOR: The doors. 
2111,(They shut the doors and pull filing cabinets across in front of them.)
2112,
2113,HENDERSON: How do you feel? 
2114,SARAH: I feel like I've been dragged through a hedge backwards. 
2115,SCORBY: What is that stuff? 
2116,HENDERSON: Latest military defoliant. Still on the secret list. Pity
2117,we've used it all. 
2118,"DOCTOR: Come on, we've got to get every plant out of this place and"
2119,dump it outside. 
2120,"HENDERSON: What for, Doctor? "
2121,DOCTOR: They're the eyes and ears of the Krynoid. 
2122,SCORBY: We'd better keep an eye open for that lunatic Chase. 
2123,DOCTOR: Good idea. 
2124, [Outside the greenhouse] 
2125," (They all start moving the ferns, ficus and other"
2126,"pot plants outside, then Chase shuts the door behind them.) "
2127,SARAH: Look! 
2128,(The Krynoid towers over the mansion. Scorby struggles with the door.) 
2129,SCORBY: Out of the way. It's locked!

2142, BERESFORD: And another. Fire! 
2143, [Outside the greenhouse] 
2144, (The Krynoid staggers and moves away.) 
2145,DOCTOR: The other door. Come on! 
2146,"(They run around the side of the courtyard, behind the Krynoid, and get"
2147,in through a small door. Chase hears it slam shut.) 
2148, [Grounds] 
2149, BERESFORD: Hit it square in the chest. Fire! Fire!
2150,Fire! 
2151,(The Krynoid staggers.) 
2152,"BERESFORD: Come on, out. "
2153,(The laser squad retreats.) 
2154, [Plant lab] 
2155, (The greenhouse plants are up against the
2156,connecting door.) 
2157,DOCTOR: We've got to find Chase before he has another attack of
2158,"megalomania. Krynoid on the outside, a madman lurking inside, not a"
2159,happy situation. 
2160,"SARAH: Do you think he's counting on the Krynoid sparing him, if, well,"
2161,if he sacrifices us? 
2162,"HENDERSON: Well, Major Beresford did do his best, even if it was like"
2163,using a peashooter 
2164,"DOCTOR: Shush, shush, shush. I think we've been wrong about Chase up"
2165,till now. 
2166,HENDERSON: What are you on about? 
2167,"DOCTOR: Will you just shut up a minute, please? You said Chase went"
2168,"outside and actually took photographs of the Krynoid, and came in"
2169,apparently unharmed. Unharmed? 
2170,SARAH: You mean he's actually infected? 
2171,DOCTOR: Or possessed. 
2172, [Grounds] 
2173, (UNIT are still beating a hasty retreat.) 
2174,"BERESFORD: Come on, quick, come on! "
2175, [Corridor] 
2176, DOCTOR: You and Henderson take that corridor.
2177,Sarah and I will go this way. 
2178,(They all leave. Chase steps out of hiding and goes into ) 
2179, [Plant lab] 
2180, (Where he looks at the defoliant tanks on the
2181,bench.) 
2182,CHASE: Filth. 
2183,(Then he goes to the music sound system which is on the filing cabinets
2184,in front of the greenhouse doors and smashes it.) 
2185, [Corridor] 
2186," SARAH: (sotto) Doctor, maybe he's not in the"
2187,house. 
2188,DOCTOR: I doubt that. 
2189,(He opens a door to be confronted by a wall of foliage. He closes it
2190,again as Henderson comes up.) 
2191,"HENDERSON: Doctor, there's creeper breaking through into the corridor. "
2192,DOCTOR: Where's Scorby? 
2193,HENDERSON: He's back in the main lab. 
2194,"DOCTOR: Come on, let's join him there. "
2195, [Main gate] 
2196, THACKERAY: What happened? 
2197,BERESFORD: We've had to pull back. The laser's hopeless against it. 
2198,THACKERAY: And you haven't made contact with the Doctor? 
2199,"BERESFORD: No, not yet, but I'm going to try and get through with a"
2200,couple of men. 
2201, [Plant lab] 
2202, (The Krynoid pushes a tentacle through a window
2203,and flails around inside briefly.) 
2204,SCORBY: It's like we're under siege. 
2205,(A corner of the ceiling is pushed in. Henderson gives his rifle to the
2206,Doctor.) 
2207,"HENDERSON: Here, do your best. I'll go and see if I can get some more"
2208,timber. 
2209,"DOCTOR: Yes, you go and do that. "
2210,"(The Doctor gives the rifle to Scorby. In the compost room, Chase hears"
2211,"Henderson ripping out planks nearby, and picks up a large spanner. He"
2212,goes and hits the soldier over the head then drags him away. The
2213,Krynoid is pushing in a corner of the building. Scorby finishes nailing
2214,a plank over the broken window.) 
2215,SCORBY: It's trying its luck on the east wing now. I still say we make
2216,a break for it. 
2217,"DOCTOR: Oh Scorby, just think about what we're up against. Everything"
2218,that grows in the ground is your enemy. You wouldn't get far. 
2219,SCORBY: So what are we supposed to do? Wait here until the Krynoid
2220,reduces this place to rubble? 
2221,SARAH: Don't be so negative. Major Beresford's going to come up with
2222,something. 
2223,"SCORBY: Oh yeah. That laser gun was useless, wasn't it. Look, I've"
2224,"never relied on anybody, just myself. I've always got myself out of"
2225,"trouble. Africa, the Middle East, you name it. I've not been a"
2226,"mercenary for nothing. I'm a survivor, right? "
2227,"DOCTOR: Hmm? Scorby, bullets and bombs aren't the answer to everything."
2228,
2229,(The room shakes and more ceiling plaster comes down.) 
2230,SCORBY: What are we going to do? 
2231,"SARAH: Oh, just shut up, will you? We're all in the same boat. "
2232,SCORBY: And where's your precious Beresford? I suppose he's dropped
2233,"everything and run, has he? "
2234,"DOCTOR: No more than you would, Scorby. "
2235,(Chase has tied up the unconscious Henderson and loaded him into the
2236,compost machine. He switches it on.) 
2237,"SARAH: (looking out of the window.) It's coming back this way, Doctor."
2238,Any hope yet? 
2239,(The Doctor is repairing the sound system.) 
2240,DOCTOR: Oh yes. Chase didn't do any irreparable damage. I think I can
2241,fix this. 
2242,SARAH: Well done. 
2243,SCORBY: Oh yeah. Well done Doctor. Why are you bothering? It's obvious
2244,your army friends have scarpered. I'd have done the same if I'd been
2245,"out there. We're as dead as mutton, you realise? RIP. It's ridiculous,"
2246,isn't it. 
2247,"DOCTOR: Stop feeling sorry for yourself, Scorby. It'll become a habit. "
2248,(The room shakes again. Scorby runs to a small outside door and moves
2249,the filing cabinet aside to open it.) 
2250,"DOCTOR: No, Scorby, don't! Don't go, Scorby, you won't make it! "
2251,(Scorby plunges into the vegetation beyond the door. Sarah and the
2252,Doctor push the door shut. Scorby makes it through and runs out into
2253,"the grounds, where he stumbles into a dew pond. The pondweed rises up"
2254,"and pulls him under. Meanwhile, Beresford and his men make their way to"
2255,"an old stone terrace, where they have a clear view of the Krynoid which"
2256,is now so big it is practically smothering the old house.) 
2257,(A loud drumming noise starts up.) 
2258,SARAH: What's that? 
2259,DOCTOR: Probably the plants have got into the humidity system. 
2260,"SARAH: Well, that means the water could boil up and blow suddenly. "
2261,DOCTOR: It's possible. 
2262,"SARAH: Oh, great. That's all we need. A scalding shower. "
2263,DOCTOR: Ah. Henderson. Sergeant Henderson? 
2264,SARAH: He's not back yet. 
2265,DOCTOR: You go and get him. 
2266,SARAH: Right. 
2267,DOCTOR: Tell him I need Beresford's wavelength. 
2268, [Corridor] 
2269, (Sarah finds the planks lying on the floor.) 
2270,SARAH: Sergeant? Sergeant? Sergeant? 
2271, [Compost room] 
2272, SARAH: Sergeant? Sergeant? 
2273,(Chase closes the door behind her.) 
2274,CHASE: The sergeant's no longer with us. He's in the garden. He's part
2275,of the garden. 
2276,SARAH: That's very clever of you. 
2277,"CHASE: Don't humour me, Miss Smith. We're helping the plant world, the"
2278,"sergeant and I. In different ways, of course. I've become part of a"
2279,"life that I've always admired for its beauty, colours, sensitivity. I"
2280,"have the Krynoid to thank, as it thanks me for its opportunity to exist"
2281,"here on Earth. Soon the Krynoids will dominate everywhere, and your"
2282,foul species will disappear. 
2283,SARAH: And you'll all flower happily ever after. 
2284,CHASE: You and your kind are nothing but parasites. You're dependant
2285,upon us for the air you breathe and the food you eat. We have only one
2286,use for you. 
2287, [Grounds] 
2288, (Beresford speaks into his R/T.) 
2289,"BERESFORD: This is Scorpio section. I say again, this is Scorpio"
2290,section. Are you receiving me? Over. 
2291, [Plant lab] 
2292," DOCTOR: Hello, Beresford, this is the Doctor. I"
2293,can hear you. Over. 
2294,"BERESFORD : Great. What's your situation, Doctor? "
2295,DOCTOR: Desperate. We're trapped. What action are you taking against
2296,the Krynoid? 
2297,"BERESFORD : The laser had no effect. Frankly, we're stuck for an"
2298,answer. 
2299,"DOCTOR: Listen, Beresford. By my reckoning you've got about before the"
2300,Krynoid reaches the point of primary germination. 
2301, [Grounds] 
2302, BERESFORD: What's he mean? 
2303,"THACKERAY: Give me that. Doctor, Thackeray here. What do you mean by"
2304,primary germination? 
2305,DOCTOR : I mean the Krynoid is about to eject hundreds of embryo
2306,pods. The whole planet will be doomed. 
2307,THACKERAY: How can we stop it? 
2308,"DOCTOR : There's only one way, Sir Colin. A low level attack by"
2309,aircraft with high explosives. 
2310,THACKERAY: But that'll mean destroying the house too. What about you
2311,and the others? 
2312, [Plant lab] 
2313," DOCTOR: Never mind us. Order that attack, it's"
2314,your only chance. Out. 
2315,(The Doctor goes in search of Sarah.) 
2316, [Grounds] 
2317, RAF : I'll be with you in figures three
2318,minutes. Over. 
2319,"BERESFORD: Roger, Red Leader. Out. "
2320,(Beresford goes to Thackeray.) 
2321,"BERESFORD: Well, the planes are on their way. Three minutes. "
2322,THACKERAY: Is there no way we can get them out? 
2323,BERESFORD: Not a chance. 
2324, [Compost room] 
2325, (As a flight of five jets head towards their
2326,"target, Chase is trussing up an unconscious Sarah in the compost"
2327,machine. Then he switches it on and stand backs to watch. Sarah wakes
2328,up and the Doctor bursts in. Chase briefly struggles with him but is
2329,easily pushed away. The Doctor switches off the machine and jumps into
2330,the hopper to untie Sarah. He lifts her out as Chase switches the
2331,machine on again. Chase grabs the Doctor and is pulled inside the
2332,hopper as he wrestles with him.) 
2333,"DOCTOR: Quick, Sarah, the button. The button! "
2334,SARAH: I can't 
2335,(The Doctor climbs out of the hopper but Chase hands on to one arm.
2336,Sarah still has her hands tied behind her as she hops up and down
2337,"trying to reach the control panel. Finally, Chase's gloves hands slide"
2338,off the Doctor's sleeve and he goes into the shredder with a scream.
2339,The Doctor unties Sarah properly.) 
2340,"DOCTOR: Sarah, I tried to save him. He was trying to pull me in. "
2341,(Sarah sobs and they leave the grisly room.) 
2342, [Grounds] 
2343, (Two jets fly overhead at low level.) 
2344,BERESFORD: That was a sighting run. Scorpio section to Red Leader.
2345,Over. 
2346,RAF : Red Leader section. We see your target. We're turning to
2347,attack now. Over. 
2348,BERESFORD: Understood. Good luck. Out. 
2349,THACKERAY: Still no sign of the Doctor. 
2350,BERESFORD: Afraid not. 
2351,RAF : (unintelligible) again. Let's turn it into chop suey. 
2352, [Corridor] 
2353, (Another door to the outside is blocked by
2354,foliage.) 
2355,"SARAH: Where do we go? We've a Krynoid outside, steam inside, bombs"
2356,overhead. 
2357,DOCTOR: Steam. Steam! 
2358,(The Doctor goes to a set of pipes in the wall and starts to undo one
2359,of them.) 
2360,"DOCTOR: Stand by that door, Sarah. "
2361,SARAH: Right. 
2362,"DOCTOR: When I say. Come on, come on. "
2363,"(He unfastens a pipe, puts his hat over the end as he turns it towards"
2364,"the doorway, then) "
2365,DOCTOR: Now! 
2366,"(Sarah opens the door, the Doctor takes his hat off the pipe and hot"
2367,steam gushes at the plants outside. They stop moving.) 
2368,DOCTOR: Come on! 
2369, [Grounds] 
2370, (The Doctor and Sarah fight their way through the
2371,unhappy foliage to an area of felled trees. They take cover behind a
2372,large log as the RAF begin their attack run. The first strike takes out
2373,"part of the house, the second hits the Krynoid. So does the third, and"
2374,"lumps of green fly everywhere, then the whole building explodes."
2375,Historic property and alien plant burn up in the intense fire.) 
2376, [Thackeray's office] 
2377," THACKERAY: Well, Doctor, do you think we've heard"
2378,the last of the Krynoid? 
2379,"DOCTOR: Sir Colin, the Intergalactic Floral Society, of which quite"
2380,"naturally I'm the President, finds Krynoids a difficult subject to"
2381,study. Their researchers tend to disappear. 
2382,"SARAH: Hmm, I can imagine. A case of one veg and no meat. "
2383,"THACKERAY: Very neat, Miss Smith. "
2384,SARAH: Sorry about that. 
2385,"THACKERAY: And talking of societies, Doctor, the Royal Horticultural"
2386,Society's got wind of this affair. They'd rather like you to address
2387,one of their meetings. 
2388,DOCTOR: Really? When? 
2389,THACKERAY: I think they suggested the fifteenth. 
2390,"DOCTOR: Fifteenth, fifteenth. No, impossible. I'm fully booked for the"
2391,"next two centuries, but any time after that. "
2392,"THACKERAY: Doctor, I don't know when you're being serious. "
2393,"SARAH: I know just how you feel, Sir Colin. "
2394,DOCTOR: Have you ever heard of Cassiopeia? 
2395,"SARAH: Animal, vegetable or mineral? "
2396,DOCTOR: It's a good place for a holiday. We need a break. Come on. 
2397,"SARAH: Oh, great! "
2398,"DOCTOR: Sir Colin, do you fancy a little excursion? "
2399,"THACKERAY: I'd be delighted, but my wife's expecting me home for tea. "
2400, [Antarctica] 
2401, (The Tardis materialises in a white landscape.
2402,Sarah runs out in swimming costume and carrying a beach ball then
2403,suddenly stops.) 
2404,"SARAH: Ah, this isn't Cassiopeia. "
2405,DOCTOR: It's Antarctica. 
2406,SARAH: We're back where we started! 
2407,DOCTOR: Yes. 
2408,SARAH: We won't get a suntan here. 
2409,DOCTOR: No. 
2410,"SARAH: You forgot to cancel the coordinate programme, didn't you. "
2411,DOCTOR: Yes. 
2412,SARAH: Shall we try again? 
2413,DOCTOR: Yes. Just a minute. 
2414,SARAH: What? 
2415,"DOCTOR: Have we been here before, or "
2416,BOTH: Are we yet to come?
