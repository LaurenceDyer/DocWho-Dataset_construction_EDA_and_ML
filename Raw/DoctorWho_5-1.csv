21,One 
22, [Tardis]
23,
24, (The Doctor and Victoria enter.) 
25,"DOCTOR: There we are. Well, what do you think? "
26,VICTORIA: I don't know. I can't believe it. It's so big. Where are we? 
27,"DOCTOR: Oh, it's the Tardis. It's my home. At least, it has been for a"
28,considerable number of years. 
29,VICTORIA: What are all these knobs? 
30,"DOCTOR: What, these? "
31,JAMIE: Instruments. These are for controlling our flight. 
32,VICTORIA: Flight? 
33,"JAMIE: Well, yes. You see, we travel around in here through time and"
34,space. 
35,"DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no, no. Don't laugh. It's true. Your father and"
36,"Maxtible were working on the same problem, but I have perfected a"
37,"rather special model, which enables me to travel through the universe"
38,of time. 
39,"VICTORIA: How can you? I mean, if what you say is true then you must"
40,"be, er, well, how old? "
41,"DOCTOR: Well, if we count in Earth terms, I suppose I must be about"
42,"four hundred, yes, about four hundred and fifty years old. Yes, well,"
43,"quite. Now, I think Victoria might find that dress a little"
44,"impracticable if she's going to join us in our adventures. Jamie, show"
45,"her where she can find some new ones, will you? "
46,"JAMIE: Aye, right. This way, Victoria. Try to give us a smooth take"
47,"off, Doctor? We don't want to frighten her. "
48,(Jamie leaves.) 
49,DOCTOR: A smooth take off? A smooth take off! What a nerve! 
50,(The Tardis dematerialises.)
51,
52, [Telos]
53,
54, (A simple yet elegant curved space rocket sits on
55,three spindly legs on the only flat piece of land available. It's only
56,visible markings are a chequered pattern around it. Up on a nearby
57,"cliff, a there is a dark-skinned man.) "
58,"PARRY : Hey, Toberman! Get that big head down! "
59,(The man walks to the edge of a cliff and looks down at the party in
60,the gully.) 
61,"PARRY: (bearded Welshman, gesturing at him) What's the matter with you?"
62,Have you gone mad? 
63,VINER: (balding man) The fool. Doesn't he realise the danger he's in?
64,It's nothing to laugh at. None of us knows what's going to happen when
65,"we press that thing, especially in this rarified atmosphere. "
66,"PARRY: All right. Viner, no need to get excited. (to the woman) Can't"
67,you keep your servant under control? 
68,"KAFTAN: (Middle Eastern) If I wish, I can. "
69,"HOPPER: (blond American) Hurry it up, will you, Rogers! I don't know"
70,what you think you're going to find anyway. 
71,"PARRY: According to the map reference now, that should be the entrance"
72,to the city of Telos. 
73,"HOPPER: I hope you're right, because I want to get out of here. "
74,"KLIEG: (German, balding) Let me remind you, Mister Hopper, that you are"
75,being more than well paid for your part in this expedition. 
76,"HOPPER: Oh, big deal. "
77,ROGERS: (younger man) Sorry. We had to make it a pretty big one. 
78,"PARRY: All right, let's get on with it. We've wasted enough time. "
79,(The group scramble further up the cliff and take cover.) 
80,PARRY: Stand by. Everybody down! 
81,"(The remote detonator is activated, and part of the opposite cliff face"
82,is blown away. The group comes out to look.) 
83,PARRY: Oh no. 
84,"HOPPER: Well, there you go. You blast yourself one lump of rock and all"
85,you've got is another. 
86,"(Professor Parry turns away in disgust, and Rogers looks again at the"
87,rock face.) 
88,"ROGERS: No, wait a minute, look! "
89,(To the side of the area they blew up are is a clearly artificial
90,opening in the cliff.) 
91,"HOPPER: Man, you just blew yourself a pair of doors. "
92,(Cheers all round.) 
93,"PARRY: Well, come on. What are we waiting for? "
94,"(The team hurry up to the entrance, led by Toberman and Kaftan.)"
95,
96, [Outside the Tomb]
97,
98, (The entrance is a recessed metallic structure
99,with double doors in the middle. On either side are images of strange
100,humanoid creatures with chest plates and helmets with handles.) 
101,KAFTAN: Fifty pounds for the first man to open the doors. 
102,"PARRY: Miss Kaftan, I must remind you that I am the leader of this "
103,(An anonymous man walks up to the doors and takes a firm hold of the
104,handles. He promptly gets electrocuted for his efforts.) 
105,PARRY: What happened? 
106,KLIEG: I don't know. 
107,"HOPPER: Well, one thing for sure, he's not going to collect fifty"
108,pounds from you or anybody else. 
109,VINER: Quiet. Quiet a minute. 
110,PARRY: What's it? 
111,(The Tardis is materialising out of sight.) 
112,VINER: It sounded like an engine. Something came down over there behind
113,that rock. 
114,"HOPPER: Okay, Viner, slow down, I'll take care of this. Jim, behind"
115,that rock. 
116,"CALLUM: (American) Okay, I've got it. "
117,"(As the Americans hide, guns drawn, the Doctor, Victoria and Jamie come"
118,around the side of a scree. Victoria is in a daring knee-length dress.)
119,
120,"HOPPER: Hold it right there, friend. "
121,"DOCTOR: If you put it like that, I certainly will. "
122,"CALLUM: Did you hear that, Professor? English. "
123,"PARRY: Yes. All right, Hopper. "
124,(Hopper lowers his weapon.) 
125,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
126,PARRY: Who are you and where do you come from? 
127,HOPPER: And you'd better have a good story. 
128,JAMIE: Maybe you'll not get one. 
129,"HOPPER: Listen, fella, we're not playing games. "
130,ROGERS: You'd better listen to him. 
131,DOCTOR: Now what's been happening over here? 
132,(The Doctor goes over to the body.) 
133,KLIEG: He was killed the moment you made your appearance. 
134,"DOCTOR: Ah, and you think we did it? Oh, no. I can assure you that we"
135,had nothing to do with the death of this man. He appears to have been
136,electrocuted. Trying to open these doors perhaps? 
137,ROGERS: He seems to know all the answers. 
138,HOPPER: A wise guy. 
139,VINER: I think this fellow must be the member of a rival expedition. 
140,DOCTOR: Expedition? 
141,PARRY: We've tried to keep it a secret. Unsuccessfully now it appears. 
142,VINER: Look at him. Archaeologist written all over him. 
143,DOCTOR: Really? Does it show? 
144,"VINER: There, you see? It's impossible to keep a secret in the"
145,scientific world. 
146,"VICTORIA: Doctor, what do you mean? "
147,"JAMIE: Tell them, Doctor. Go on, tell them. "
148,DOCTOR: No. Not until they tell me what the purpose of their
149,expedition. 
150,PARRY: This is an archaeological expedition. We're searching the
151,universe for the last remains of the Cybermen. 
152,JAMIE: Cybermen? You mean to say they came from here? 
153,PARRY: But of course. Telos was their home. This is the entrance to
154,their city. 
155,VINER: We know they died out many centuries ago. What we don't know is
156,why they died out. 
157,"HOPPER: Callum, Rogers, get him back to the rocket. I'll be with you in"
158,a minute. 
159,CALLUM: Okay. 
160,"HOPPER: Well, that's that. Are you coming back to the rocket with me,"
161,Professor? 
162,PARRY: What for? 
163,"HOPPER: You're not going on with this, are you? Look I don't know if"
164,"these people have anything to do with it or not, but one of my men has"
165,just been killed. You're not paying that kind of money. 
166,"PARRY: Yes, I suppose that's quite true. "
167,"HOPPER: Yeah, you think it over. Come on, let's go. We'll wait for you"
168,back at the ship. 
169,"DOCTOR: The problem, I take it, is to open these doors, right? "
170,"KLIEG: Ha, brilliant. "
171,PARRY: That is the problem. 
172,KLIEG: And we would prefer it if you returned to wherever you came
173,from. 
174,"JAMIE: Oh, not very friendly, are they, Doctor? "
175,"VICTORIA: Oh yes, do as he says. "
176,DOCTOR: I'm afraid that that became impossible the moment that name was
177,mentioned. 
178,VICTORIA: What name? 
179,DOCTOR: Cybermen. 
180,VICTORIA: Cybermen? What are they? 
181,VINER: I knew they were here on the same quest. 
182,PARRY: No one would come here for any other reason. 
183,DOCTOR: We must stay. 
184,"JAMIE: Oh, Doctor! "
185,"VICTORIA: Oh, must we? I don't like the look of those things at all. "
186,DOCTOR: We shall stay and help you with your search. 
187,KLIEG: Perhaps we don't want your help. 
188,"DOCTOR: That's just it, you so obviously do. Now I'm sure we can agree."
189,I can open those doors for you. 
190,"KLIEG: It is our problem, and I suggest you take this ridiculous"
191,expedition of yours off this planet. 
192,JAMIE: It seems to me that we've got as much right here as you have. 
193,"PARRY: Of course you have. Mister Klieg, must I remind you again that"
194,"you do not speak for this expedition? I am it's leader, you and Miss"
195,Kaftan are only here on sufferance. 
196,KLIEG: Thank you. And whose money is paying for the hire of that
197,rocket? 
198,KAFTAN: Mine! 
199,PARRY: I thought I made it quite clear that your financial support did
200,not entitle you to a say in the running of this expedition. 
201,"KAFTAN: Of course it was quite clear. Was it not, Eric? "
202,KLIEG: Of course. No one questions your leadership. 
203,"DOCTOR: Ah, good, that's all settled. And now we shall open these"
204,doors. 
205,JAMIE: What? 
206,"PARRY: Careful, man! "
207,HAYDON: Hey look out! 
208,VICTORIA: Doctor! 
209,"(The Doctor puts his magnetic voltmeter on the handles, checks the"
210,reading and removes it.) 
211,DOCTOR: It's perfectly safe now. 
212,PARRY: You'll be killed! 
213,"HAYDON: No, don't touch him! "
214,(The Doctor grabs a handle and pulls but can't move it.) 
215,DOCTOR: I'm afraid it's beyond my strength. 
216,"JAMIE: Let me, Doctor. "
217,DOCTOR: Jamie. 
218,(Jamie can't move them either.) 
219,"JAMIE: Aye, well, I've not had much exercise lately. "
220,DOCTOR: Quite. I think here is a gentleman who can open these doors for
221,us. 
222,KAFTAN: He is my servant. I will not have him risk his life. 
223,PARRY: Surely it was for just such a contingency as this that you
224,insisted we bring him with us? 
225,"DOCTOR: Oh, there's no danger now. Unless of course he's afraid. "
226,(Toberman steps forward.) 
227,"DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, he's not afraid. "
228,(Toberman pulls open the right door then the left. They are about a
229,foot thick.) 
230,PARRY: Come on. 
231,"DOCTOR: No, wait, wait. I would be very careful in there if I were you."
232,
233,HAYDON: But why wasn't Toberman killed? Why weren't you killed? 
234,DOCTOR: The poor fellow who died drained all there electricity out of
235,his body. It's perfectly safe to go in there now. 
236,"KLIEG: Come on, then. We're wasting time. Of course. After you,"
237,Professor. 
238,"(Parry, Klieg and the party walk inside.) "
239,DOCTOR: But I'd still. I'd still be very careful if I were you. Very
240,"careful indeed! Come on, let's go and join them. Come on, Victoria. "
241,(Victoria stays rooted to the spot.) 
242,"DOCTOR: You look very nice in that dress, Victoria. "
243,VICTORIA: Thank you. Don't you think it's a bit 
244,"DOCTOR: A bit short? Oh, I shouldn't worry about that. Look at Jamie's."
245,
246,"JAMIE: Hey, I'll have you know that. Oh, aye. "
247,DOCTOR: Come along. Come along. Let's go and see what the others are
248,"doing, shall we? Come along. "
249,[Central chamber]
250,
251, (They walk down a small slope into a clean metal
252,"room. There are banks of instruments below a big dial to our right, a"
253,"doorway with a Cyberman image above it ahead, and more instrumentation"
254,to the left.) 
255,"VICTORIA: Mercy, just look at this place. "
256,VINER: These controls are of their earlier dynasty. 
257,"HAYDON: Not so very early as all that by the look of it. Look, John. "
258,"VINER: Yes, I'm quite capable of making my own deductions, thank you. "
259,HAYDON: All right. 
260,(To the left of the main doorway is a large hatch cover.) 
261,KLIEG: Be careful. There might be danger in there. 
262,"KAFTAN: Don't worry, with Toberman to guard me. What is more important"
263,is to keep an eye on these strangers. 
264,KLIEG: Well I tried to 
265,KAFTAN: Do not raise your voice. You will achieve nothing by shouting.
266,You look after the Doctor and I will watch the girl. 
267,KLIEG: And the Scots boy? 
268,"KAFTAN: Leave him to Toberman. Ay, Toberman? But you will be careful"
269,"and discreet, understand? "
270,TOBERMAN: I understand. 
271,JAMIE: Did you ever seen the like of it Doctor? 
272,"DOCTOR: Not exactly, Jamie, but very nearly. "
273,"PARRY: Now that we're all here. Now that we're all here, I think we'd"
274,better take stock of the situation. This appears to be a dead end. The
275,only way out appears to be through that hatch. 
276,KAFTAN: Are there no doors? 
277,"PARRY: No, apart from the entrance. "
278,"DOCTOR: And the other two, of course. "
279,VINER: Two other doors? 
280,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. One in that section, and one in that section over"
281,"there. Activated, I imagine, by this simple logical system over here."
282,"Here we are, I think. "
283,"(The Doctor moves levers 6, 4 and 5, there's a beep and a door to the"
284,right of the entrance slides up.) 
285,"DOCTOR: Yes, splendid, splendid. A simple logical gate. "
286,(He does the same with another set of levers and the door opposite the
287,entrance lifts.) 
288,"KLIEG: Doctor, you seem to be very familiar with this place. "
289,"DOCTOR: Oh no, not really. It's all based upon symbolic logic, the same"
290,"as you use in computers. The opening mechanism for this door, an OR"
291,gate. you call it. 
292,"KLIEG: Yes, yes, I can see that, but how did you know in the first"
293,place? 
294,"DOCTOR: Oh, I use my own special technique. "
295,"KLIEG: Oh really, Doctor? And may we know what that is? "
296,DOCTOR: Keeping my eyes open and my mouth shut. 
297,PARRY: We're far too many to explore together. I think we'd better
298,"divide up. If you, Mister Viner would take that door with er "
299,JAMIE: Jamie. 
300,"PARRY: Jamie and Mister Haydon. Mister Klieg, the Doctor and myself"
301,will make up the other party. 
302,"VICTORIA: Well, what about us? "
303,PARRY: I think the women had better remain here. 
304,"VICTORIA: Oh, rubbish. We can make a party. "
305,KAFTAN: Certainly. With Toberman to guard us we need fear no one. 
306,"PARRY: Right. Mister Klieg, will you take them along with you? "
307,KLIEG: I prefer to stay here. 
308,"PARRY: As you wish. Mister Viner, will you go along with the women? "
309,VINER: If you like. 
310,PARRY: But get back to the spacecraft by 1630. You all know the
311,"temperature drop at night, so we'll meet back here at 1625. If anyone"
312,is missing that'll give us an hour to look for them before we have to
313,leave. 
314,"VINER: Come on, then. we might as well try that opening over there. "
315,KAFTAN: We'd better keep close together. 
316,VICTORIA: I'm all right thank you. 
317,(They go through the central doorway.) 
318,"HAYDON: Come on, Jamie. "
319,JAMIE: Right. 
320,(Haydon and Jamie take the right hand door.) 
321,"PARRY: Now to concentrate on this, whatever it is. This hatch must lead"
322,somewhere and there must be some opening mechanism. What was that about
323,symbolic logic? Any ideas? 
324,"DOCTOR: No, not really. I think it's about time we gave Mister Klieg a"
325,chance to show off his archaeological skills? I love to see the experts
326,"at work, don't you?"
327,
328, [Projector room]
329,
330, (The central door has led to a room full of
331,equipment. It is dominated by a contraption with three projectors.) 
332,VINER: Come on. Right in. Where's Toberman? 
333,KAFTAN: I sent him to join the others. We do not need any other
334,protection now that you are with us. 
335,"VINER: Yes, well, shall we commence? Everything must be carefully"
336,measured and recorded. 
337,VICTORIA: What is this room? 
338,VINER: I don't know. Possibly this is where the Cybermen are made. 
339,VICTORIA: I wonder what this is. 
340,"VINER: Do you mind? You're getting in my way. Just go over there, will"
341,you? 
342,"VICTORIA: Oh, fiddle! "
343,KAFTAN: Could this not be the purpose of the room? 
344,VINER: Yes? 
345,"KAFTAN: A Cyberman would stand in that form and be, well, revitalised? "
346,(There is a large Cyberman-shaped recess opposite the projector.) 
347,"VINER: Yes, that's reasonable. These projectors were probably made to"
348,"fire in neuro-electric potential. Yes, that's it, I think you're right."
349,
350,VICTORIA: Revitalising is just what I need. 
351,"(Victoria tries to step into the recess, but the leg slots are too long"
352,for her.) 
353,"VICTORIA: Oh mercy, the Cybermen must have been giants. "
354,VINER: Will you please be careful. The first rule of archaeological
355,work is that nothing must be touched until its been described and
356,recorded.
357,
358, [Testing room]
359,
360," JAMIE: Hey, you know, it's just struck me. All the"
361,"corridors in here are as light as day, yet there are no windows. "
362,HAYDON: Alpha-meson phosphor. 
363,JAMIE: Eh? 
364,HAYDON: It's a lighting system that never goes out. Works by letting
365,cosmic rays bombard a layer of barium. 
366,"JAMIE: Oh aye, that. "
367,"HAYDON: Point is, what was this room used for? "
368,"JAMIE: Well, possibly for raising caterpillars, like this one. "
369,"HAYDON: Hey, for heavens sake watch out until we know what it is. "
370,"JAMIE: Och, it's as dead as a stone. "
371,(Jamie is holding a tiny metallic creature with a pair of staring eyes
372,and little antennae.)
373,
374, [Central chamber]
375,
376,"(The big dial is lit up now, and flashing blocks of"
377,numbers as the indicator finger swings to and fro.) 
378,PARRY: Well? 
379,"KLIEG: Well, the basis of this code is binary to digital conversion"
380,with a intervening step involving a sort of Whitehead logic. 
381,"Well, when this Burrier series is complete, there is no more to be"
382,done. 
383,"DOCTOR: Yes, but why do it at all? "
384,"PARRY: Really, Doctor, for an archaeologist you seem to be curiously"
385,lacking in curiosity. 
386,"DOCTOR: Some things are better left undone, and I have a feeling that"
387,this is one of them. 
388,KLIEG: What do you mean by that? 
389,"DOCTOR: Well, it's all too easy, isn't it? "
390,KLIEG: Easy? 
391,"PARRY: I wouldn't call this an easy survey, would you, Klieg? "
392,"KLIEG: Everything here is designed to keep their secrets, whatever they"
393,"are, insoluble. "
394,DOCTOR: Insoluble? 
395,KLIEG: But take this 
396,"DOCTOR: Oh, I wouldn't say that. "
397,"KLIEG: But take this mathematical sequence, for example. I'm really no"
398,nearer to it's solution. I've tried every possible combination. You'd
399,hardly call that easy! 
400,(The Doctor reads Klieg's notebook.) 
401,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, what you've done here is mostly right. "
402,"KLIEG: Why, thank you. "
403,"DOCTOR: You see, if you take any progressive series it can be converted"
404,"into binary notation. If you take the sum of the integrants, and"
405,"express the result as a power series, then the indices show the basic"
406,"binary blocks. Only I wouldn't do it if I were you. Oh no, I really"
407,wouldn't do it! 
408,KLIEG: Of course. You're right. 
409,(Klieg goes to the row of levers below the dial and starts moving
410,them.) 
411,KLIEG: Look! Sum between limits of one and nine one integral into power
412,series. Yes! yes! Then you differentiate 
413,(There is a sound of increasing power generation. The lights start to
414,flicker.) 
415,DOCTOR: You fool! Why couldn't you leave it alone! 
416,PARRY: What's happening? 
417,DOCTOR: I don't know. Perhaps the Cybermen aren't quite as dormant as
418,you imagine. We must find out what has happened to the others.
419,
420, [Projector room]
421,
422, (Victoria climbs into the recess again. Kaftan
423,goes to a control panel and pulls a lever. The lid of the recess closes
424,as Victoria screams.) 
425,VINER: Did you touch anything? 
426,KAFTAN: No! 
427,"VINER: Well, keep away from that board. Here, help me. "
428,(Kaftan is about to move another lever.) 
429,KAFTAN: One moment. 
430,VINER: Now! 
431,(She leaves it and joins him at the recess lid.) 
432,VINER: We'll need a crowbar to get this off. 
433,KAFTAN: It may already be too late. 
434, [Testing room]
435,
436, JAMIE: That's strange. 
437,HAYDON: What? 
438,JAMIE: I could swear that that thing moved. 
439,"HAYDON: You're seeing things, old chap! Come and look at this. The"
440,whole control panel is active suddenly. I don't know which button to
441,press first. 
442,"JAMIE: Oh, I wouldn't touch it if I were you. "
443,HAYDON: I think I'll try this one. Nothing. 
444,"JAMIE: Hey, wait a minute. What's happening? It's getting dark. Hey,"
445,look at the far wall! 
446,(Patterns of light are swirling.)
447,
448, [Projector room]
449,
450, VINER: It's no use. I daren't touch anything. If I
451,"operate the wrong sequence, she'll die. I must find the logical order."
452,If it's not too late. 
453,(Viner bangs on the lid. Victoria knocks back.) 
454,KAFTAN: She's still alive! 
455,"VINER: Thank heavens. Look, I'd better go and get the others, You stay"
456,her with her. 
457,"KAFTAN: Yes, but hurry. "
458,VINER: I won't be long. 
459,(Viner leaves. Kaftan knocks on the lid and gets a reply. Then she goes
460,to the row of levers and moves another one. The Doctor enters as the
461,projectors move up and down.) 
462,DOCTOR: I wouldn't touch the projector controls if I were you. Someone
463,might get hurt. 
464,"VINER: There must be some way to release it, Doctor. "
465,"DOCTOR: Yes, there is. Now let me see.)"
466,
467, [Testing room]
468,
469, (Jamie is mesmerised while Haydon is shielding his
470,eyes with his hands.) 
471,"HAYDON: Jamie. Jamie, don't watch it. "
472,JAMIE: I must. I must. I can't seem to take my eyes off it. I don't
473,want to take my eyes off it. I don't want to take my eyes off it. 
474,(Jamie walks forward.) 
475,"HAYDON: Stop, Jamie! "
476,"JAMIE: Yes, yes, I see it now. "
477,(Haydon moves the lever back to its start position and the wall goes
478,blank.) 
479,HAYDON: Are you all right? 
480,"JAMIE: Oh, where have I been? "
481,HAYDON: You've been under some form of hypnosis. 
482,JAMIE: That's ridiculous. What would the Cybermen want with a
483,hypnotising machine? 
484,"HAYDON: Yes, you're right. It must be for something else. Wait a"
485,minute. Know what it could be? 
486,JAMIE: What? 
487,HAYDON: Some kind of target. I remember reading about this somewhere.
488,They used to have something like it on Earth years ago. 
489,JAMIE: How does it work? Which bit do you aim at? 
490,HAYDON: There's a subliminal centre which you're trained to see. 
491,"JAMIE: Oh, aye. A what? "
492,"HAYDON: Come on, lets run the whole thing again and see what happens."
493,But keep your eyes off the wall. Now you work the controls this time
494,and I'll watch. 
495,JAMIE: Right. 
496,"HAYDON: Okay, press the buttons. "
497,(Haydon watches through his fingers.)
498,
499, [Projector room]
500,
501, DOCTOR: Yes I think this is the sequence. Stand by
502,"to let her out, will you. And if you, my dear, would stand well clear."
503,Thank you. Right! 
504,"(The lid swings open and Victoria comes out, gasping.) "
505,"DOCTOR: Victoria, are you all right? It's all right. Get your breath."
506,It's all right. 
507,"VICTORIA: I, I "
508,DOCTOR: It's all right now. 
509,VICTORIA: I didn't like that very much Doctor! 
510,"DOCTOR: No, I don't expect you did. You'll have to be a little more"
511,"careful in future, won't you. Now, come along. We must go and see"
512,whether Jamie is all right. Come along.
513,
514, [Central chamber]
515,
516, PARRY: There must be some way to get that hatch
517,open. 
518,KLIEG: That must be the control to do it. 
519,(Wrong lever.) 
520,"PARRY: The tombs of the Cybermen must be below ground, together with"
521,"all their records. If we can't get down there, all our work here and"
522,the sacrifice of that unfortunate fellow's life will go in vain. 
523,KLIEG: A great deal more than that 
524,PARRY: Pardon? 
525,KLIEG: Of course. There's only one explanation. The Doctor. 
526,PARRY: Yes? 
527,KLIEG: He didn't give us the complete code. There must be a further
528,sequence to operate that opening mechanism. 
529,"PARRY: All right. Well, lets try and find out. "
530,"KLIEG: Now, what could it be?"
531,
532, [Testing room]
533,
534, (The wall has moves from spirals to fractals.
535,Jamie moves the last lever and it goes blank.) 
536,HAYDON: Is that all? 
537,JAMIE: Aye. All except this big button here. What does that do? 
538,"HAYDON: I'm not sure, but we'll soon find out. I'm going to trace the"
539,"source of these shapes. There must be a projector somewhere. Look, when"
540,"I give the word, press the button. "
541,JAMIE: The big one? 
542,HAYDON: Yes. Maybe it works in conjunction with the others. 
543,JAMIE: Right. Ready when you are. 
544,"HAYDON: Okay, go ahead. "
545,(We notice that Haydon is standing in front of a possible door in the
546,back wall. The swirling pattern is a figure of eight. The Doctor
547,enters.) 
548,"DOCTOR: Oh Jamie, don't touch that control! "
549,JAMIE: I already have. What's the matter Doctor? 
550,"DOCTOR: Well, which one was it? "
551,JAMIE: Which one what? 
552,(A Cyberman come in from the right across the front of the psychedelic
553,"screen and a weapon comes out of the wall opposite. It fires, catching"
554,Haydon squarely in the back. Victoria screams.) 
555, Episode Two
556,
557, [Testing room]
558,
559," DOCTOR: What exactly happened here, Jamie? What"
560,did you do? What sequence did you use? 
561,"JAMIE: Sequence, how do you mean? Oh, you mean these! Oh, well, I just"
562,pressed that button and pulled this lever and then that lever there. 
563,"PARRY: Doctor, could you spare us a moment? I. Haydon! What's happened?"
564,
565,"VINER: He's dead. Don't you see, he's dead? It's this damn building."
566,It's alive. It's watching us! It'll get us all! We've got to leave! 
567,"PARRY: All right, Viner. This is terrible. How did it happen? "
568,VINER: We've got to get out this building. It's deadly! They'll kill
569,all of us if we don't get back to rocket. 
570,DOCTOR: They? 
571,VINER: The Cybermen! Didn't you see it? 
572,"PARRY: Cybermen? A live Cyberman? My dear Viner, they've been dead for"
573,the last five hundred years. 
574,"VINER: I tell you it was a Cyberman and it came out of there, that"
575,screen thing. 
576,JAMIE: He's right. 
577,VINER: Keep back! Keep back! You'll bring it out again. 
578,"DOCTOR: The question is, what killed him. "
579,"VINER: But you saw the Cyberman, Doctor. "
580,DOCTOR: I saw something. 
581,VINER: Well? 
582,"DOCTOR: Poor Haydon was looking at that screen, in the direction we all"
583,"were, right? "
584,VINER: Of course. Must you state the obvious? 
585,DOCTOR: It's not so obvious when you consider he was shot in the back. 
586,JAMIE: In the back? 
587,"PARRY: Are you sure, Doctor? "
588,"DOCTOR: See for yourself. Now if the Cybermen didn't shoot him, what"
589,"did? The answer, I think, lies over here. Jamie? "
590,"JAMIE: Yes, Doctor? "
591,"DOCTOR: Can you remember exactly what you did, what sequence you used? "
592,"JAMIE: Oh, I'm not sure, Doctor. "
593,DOCTOR: You must try. I want to repeat it all when I give the word. 
594,"JAMIE: Very well, Doctor. "
595,"VINER: You're crazy, man. You'll bring that, that thing out again. "
596,"DOCTOR: Maybe. I don't know. Now, Jamie, when you're ready. "
597,"JAMIE: Anytime, Doctor. "
598,DOCTOR: Now there is a distinct element of risk in what I'm asking you
599,"all to do, so if anyone wishes to leave they must do so at once. Not"
600,"you, Jamie. "
601,VINER: Can't you stop this? He'll kill us all. 
602,"DOCTOR: Not if you go back against that wall, in that corner there."
603,"Now, please. Right, Jamie. "
604,(Jamie pulls two levers and presses the big button. The figure of eight
605,pattern appears on the wall and the Cyberman slides out in front of it.
606,The weapon comes out of the opposite wall and this time the Cyberman is
607,decapitated. Victoria screams. The Doctor ducks under the weapon's
608,turret to examine it.) 
609,"JAMIE: Careful, Doctor! "
610,DOCTOR: It's all right. I think. I think it's all right now. Yes. You
611,"see, it's just a mock up, a model. No, don't touch that. That gun may"
612,be wired up too. 
613,PARRY: It's a trap. 
614,DOCTOR: No I don't think so. I think it's a testing room for weapons.
615,This is a purely robotic Cyberman. There's no human material in it at
616,all. He's a target for weapons. 
617,PARRY: Let's get back to the control room with this poor fellow. 
618,VICTORIA: What's that? 
619,JAMIE: Some wee creature I found on the floor there. 
620,(Victoria picks it up.) 
621,VICTORIA: It's a fossil. 
622,"DOCTOR: Victoria, be careful. Let me see that. "
623,(The Doctor takes the metal creature.) 
624,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's certainly inactive, but it's not a fossil. Wait a"
625,minute. 
626,(The Doctor takes out a notebook.) 
627,"DOCTOR: Yes, here we are. Yes, it's a Cybermat. "
628,VICTORIA: What's a Cybermat? 
629,DOCTOR: It's one of those. I'd leave it alone if I were you. Come
630,along. 
631,(Victoria puts the Cybermat into her huge handbag.)
632,
633, [Central chamber]
634,
635, (Toberman enters from outside.) 
636,KAFTAN: Well? 
637,TOBERMAN: It is done. 
638,KAFTAN: Good. 
639,KLIEG: I just don't understand this code. This sequence doesn't make
640,complete sense. 
641,"KAFTAN: You, a logician, you can't understand it? "
642,KLIEG: But in the time 
643,KAFTAN: You must. 
644,KLIEG: In the time we have. 
645,KAFTAN: We have plenty of time. You will see. 
646,PARRY: Lay him down there. 
647,(Haydon has been carried in.) 
648,KAFTAN: What has happened to him? 
649,VINER: There's been a terrible accident. He's been shot! 
650,"PARRY: Right, we're all here, it seems. Will you all sit down for a"
651,moment? 
652,KAFTAN: Toberman? 
653,TOBERMAN: Yes. 
654,PARRY: Mister Klieg? 
655,"KLIEG: Leave me alone. Can't you see I'm working, or have you forgotten"
656,the purpose of this expedition? 
657,PARRY: This directly concerns my expedition. You will kindly take your
658,"place. Right, I'll come straight to the point. I have reluctantly"
659,decided to abandon the expedition and return to Earth. 
660,(General consternation.) 
661,PARRY: I feel as strongly about it as you. This expedition has been my
662,dream for many years. But there were those like Mister Viner who said
663,"that more preparation was needed, more men and equipment. I refused to"
664,heed their warnings and the result is that two men have died. I'm
665,"sorry, but we must leave at the first available conjunction. We'll take"
666,"back all we can for further study, of course, but that is my decision"
667,and that is what we must do. 
668,KLIEG: I insist that 
669,PARRY: My decision is final! We leave when the north hemisphere is
670,"properly tangential, which will be at eighteen forty two. Ah, Captain"
671,Hopper. Just the man. Can you be ready to blast off at eighteen forty
672,two? 
673,HOPPER: No. 
674,PARRY: I beg your pardon? Did I hear you right? You are paid to take
675,"orders, Captain Hopper. "
676,"HOPPER: Not impossible ones, I'm not. It's the fuel pumps. Some"
677,character has balled up the lot. 
678,DOCTOR: Or something. 
679,"HOPPER: Well, whatever it is, it's practically wrecked our chances of"
680,getting off this crummy planet. 
681,"(A little later, discussions have been on-going.) "
682,VINER: I don't care what any of you say. I utterly refuse. I will not
683,spend the night on this planet. 
684,DOCTOR: I don't think we've got much choice. 
685,"VINER: Well, at least we can get out of this sinister building. I've"
686,"recorded all the necessary details, I suggest we all go back to the"
687,rocket. 
688,"HOPPER: You make a very bad suggestion, Viner, you know that? "
689,VINER: I insist. 
690,"HOPPER: You do a lot of insisting. Well, I'm going to tell you"
691,something now. The first guy that set sets foot in my rocketship is
692,going to stop the repair work just like that. 
693,PARRY: How long will it take to get the rocket operational again? 
694,"HOPPER: Working non-stop without interruption, maybe seventy two hours."
695,
696,PARRY: Seventy two hours! 
697,VINER: But that's impossible! We'd all be out of our minds after three
698,days in this place. We must go back on board. 
699,"HOPPER: Now look, I can't afford to waste any more time with you guys,"
700,"but I'll give it to you just once more, all right? Now you may not know"
701,this but we practically have to pull that ship apart to fix the damage.
702,And there just isn't room for all of you on board. Especially with you
703,"insisting all over the place. No room to work, got it? "
704,"PARRY: Yes, of course. I see now. "
705,VINER: It's all right for you. Have you any idea what it's like in this
706,deadly building? 
707,HOPPER: Well it's not exactly peaches back on the ship. 
708,"DOCTOR: Captain, you do have another reason for not wanting them back"
709,"on the ship, don't you? "
710,HOPPER: Yeah. Until I find who broke into that rocket. 
711,DOCTOR: Or what? 
712,HOPPER: Who broke into the rocket. Until then I'm going to keep a round
713,the clock guard on it. 
714,DOCTOR: I see. 
715,HOPPER: I'm going to get off this place with my skin still fitting
716,"tight all over, all right? "
717,DOCTOR: All right. 
718,"HOPPER: Now, in case it gets cold at night, I've brought these anoraks"
719,and some food. I'll let you know when I'm ready to take off. 
720,(Hopper leaves.) 
721,"KLIEG: As we have to stay, we might as well finish our job and fully"
722,"explore down there. That is, if the Professor has no objection. "
723,PARRY: We have no alternative. it seems. 
724,"DOCTOR: Well, but can't we stay here? It seems a pleasant enough room"
725,to me. 
726,"JAMIE: Hey, you speak for yourself. "
727,"KLIEG: Of course you can leave here anytime you please, Doctor. "
728,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, I was forgetting. I can, can't I. "
729,"VICTORIA: But you're not going to are you, Doctor? "
730,"DOCTOR: No. Not just yet awhile, no. But you and Jamie can go back to"
731,the Tardis if you wish. 
732,VICTORIA: I'll stay with you. 
733,DOCTOR: Jamie? 
734,"JAMIE: Oh, I'll stay. "
735,DOCTOR: Good. 
736,"DOCTOR: Now, I think it's about time we gave Mister Klieg some help. "
737,"KLIEG: Thank you, I think I can manage. "
738,TOBERMAN: Stay! 
739,"JAMIE: Hey, let the Doctor past or I'll "
740,(Toberman grabs the front of the Doctor's shirt in one hand.) 
741,"JAMIE: Yes, well, let the Doctor past. "
742,"DOCTOR: It's all right, Jamie. Your colleague has very strong hands. "
743,KAFTAN: Very strong. 
744,DOCTOR: Enough to do a good deal of damage if let loose in the right
745,place. 
746,(Kaftan gestures Toberman to let the Doctor past.) 
747,"PARRY: There's no doubt about it, the major workings lie below. There"
748,"are metal caverns down there, all interconnected. If only we can get"
749,down into them. 
750,"KLIEG: That's it! I've got it! Finally, a Boolean function of symbolic"
751,logic. 
752,"DOCTOR: Logical, yes, but "
753,"KAFTAN: Everything yields to logic. Our basic assumption, Doctor. "
754,DOCTOR: Really. 
755,"KLIEG: Six, cap, B four, if and only if, C is cap function of two A. "
756,"(Klieg adjusts the main controls, pulls a lever, and nothing happens.) "
757,DOCTOR: I think perhaps your logic is wearing a little thin. 
758,KLIEG: I must have made a mistake. I'll do it again more carefully.
759,"Six, cap, B four, if and only if, C is cap function of, ah, that's it,"
760,two F not two A. 
761,"(This time the big hatch by the entrance swings up, light coming from"
762,below.) 
763,VICTORIA: The hatch! 
764,KLIEG: I've done it! I've done it! 
765,DOCTOR: Congratulations. 
766,"JAMIE: Yeah, but Doctor, you "
767,PARRY: Excellent! Now to work. It'll be extremely cold down there. We
768,"shall all need to put on warm clothing. Mister Viner, will you see"
769,about the anoraks? 
770,KLIEG: Just a moment. Are we all going down? 
771,PARRY: There is safety in numbers. 
772,KLIEG: The women as well? 
773,"PARRY: Oh, they of course will stay up here. In case of trouble,"
774,contact the rocket. 
775,VICTORIA: I'm coming down with you. 
776,PARRY: But my dear young lady 
777,"VICTORIA: You heard me, Professor. The "
778,"DOCTOR: Victoria, you would be much safer up here. "
779,"VICTORIA: But, Doctor, I "
780,DOCTOR: And much more use to us. 
781,"VICTORIA: I don't see, "
782,DOCTOR: Keep an eye on (points at Kaftan) things. Please? 
783,VICTORIA: All right. 
784,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
785,"PARRY: Well, if we're all ready, I shall lead the descent. Be ready to"
786,go back the instant I give the word. 
787,KLIEG: You know what to do. 
788,KAFTAN: The hatch? 
789,(The Doctor puts on his cape.) 
790,DOCTOR: Mister Toberman? 
791,KAFTAN: He stays with me. 
792,DOCTOR: Then I stay here too. 
793,"KAFTAN: Of course, I am being selfish. His strength will be useful to"
794,"you down there. He must go down. Go down, Toberman. "
795,"(Toberman walks up the steps to the hatch, followed by the Doctor.) "
796,DOCTOR: Remember what I said. Be very careful. 
797,(The men disappear down through the hatchway.) 
798,KAFTAN: It seems we are to be left alone to wait. Captain Hopper
799,brought some food from the rocket. You would like some? 
800,"VICTORIA: Oh, rather. I'm ravenous. "
801,(Victoria leaves her bag by the hatch.) 
802,KAFTAN: Roast beef? Roast veal? Chicken? 
803,"VICTORIA: Oh, chicken, please "
804,(Kaftan hands over a small cube.) 
805,VICTORIA: What on Earth's this? 
806,KAFTAN: What you have asked for. Chicken. 
807,"VICTORIA: Thank you, but I'm not very hungry now. "
808,(Victoria goes to look down the hatchway. Kaftan pours liquid from a
809,thermos into a cup and drops a small pill into it with a smile.)
810,
811, [Bottom of the ladder]
812,
813," PARRY: Hurry up, there. We've no time to linger."
814,It's extremely cold down here even with these anoraks. 
815,JAMIE: You obviously knew what to expect. 
816,"DOCTOR: Well, which way do we go? "
817,KLIEG: I don't know. Let's try this way. 
818,DOCTOR: Yes. 
819, [Cavern]
820,
821,(There are active control panels in the room.) 
822,"JAMIE: Hey, what on Earth?! "
823,"PARRY: Behold, gentlemen. The tombs of the Cybermen! "
824,(The walls of the cavern are full of frosted compartments reaching high
825,above them.) 
826,JAMIE: Tombs? I don't see any tombs. 
827,"DOCTOR: In there, Jamie. Frozen forever. All their evil locked away"
828,with them. And so it must remain. 
829,KLIEG: Like a gigantic honeycomb. Like bees waiting the signal to arise
830,from their winter sleep. 
831,DOCTOR: A signal that they're never going to get. 
832,VINER: We'd better get busy. Everything must be recorded. It's too cold
833,to remain for long. 
834,KLIEG: Unless we find some way to warm things up.
835,
836, [Central chamber]
837,
838, KAFTAN: You have hardly touched your coffee. It
839,must be cold by now. You would like some more? 
840,"VICTORIA: No, thank you. I'm much warmer now. "
841,KAFTAN: That's good. 
842,VICTORIA: I feel so sleepy. 
843,(Victoria falls asleep by the steps to the hatch. Kaftan checks that
844,she is out cold then closes the hatch cover.)
845,
846, [Cavern]
847,
848, (The thud is heard down below.) 
849,VINER: What was that? 
850,JAMIE: It sounded like the hatch!
851,
852, [Bottom of the ladder]
853,
854, JAMIE: It's closed! 
855,"VINER: Oh, what's the use. We're trapped down here now. We'll never"
856,survive down in this cold. Better get back.
857,
858, [Cavern]
859,
860, DOCTOR: Well? 
861,VINER: It's closed. What have they done that for? What are they playing
862,at up there? 
863,DOCTOR: Perhaps it wasn't them. Where's Jamie? 
864,"VINER: He went up the ladder to try it. Professor. Professor, listen to"
865,"me, for heaven's sake! The hatch is down again. We're trapped down"
866,here. 
867,PARRY: Trapped? But there are some of my party up there. Are you sure? 
868,VINER: Of course I'm sure. You know how heavy that thing is. It's down
869,now. We must do something. I give us a couple of hours in here at the
870,most. 
871,DOCTOR: Mister Klieg doesn't seem to be very worried. 
872,"KLIEG: No, I'm not, Doctor. "
873,JAMIE: It won't open and I can't make anybody hear. 
874,VINER: There you are. 
875,KLIEG: There is an easy way out of our situation. 
876,VINER: You've found something? 
877,KLIEG: Of course you're forgetting your logic. If it closes it can be
878,"opened, from here. "
879,"DOCTOR: Conveniently labelled in symbolic logic, I notice. "
880,"KLIEG: Right, are we ready? I shall now operate the sequence. "
881,DOCTOR: If it is the opening device. 
882,"KLIEG: It's obviously an opening device of some kind, Doctor. "
883,VINER: I don't know how you can be so blasted calm about it all! 
884,JAMIE: I'll see if it works then. 
885,JAMIE : Go ahead! 
886,(Klieg moves levers.) 
887,JAMIE : Nothing happening out here. 
888,VINER: It doesn't work. 
889,"(Whilst the others concentrate on the hatch, Klieg turns to the vast"
890,network of tombs with a smile. They start to defrost.) 
891, [Bottom of the ladder] 
892, (Something drips on Parry.) 
893,PARRY: Water! 
894,"JAMIE: Aye, it's getting warmer. "
895,VINER: The ice is melting. 
896,"JAMIE: Hey, look behind you! "
897, [Cavern] 
898, VINER: Look! Look at the honeycomb! There's
899,something inside. 
900,(There is movement inside the defrosted cells.) 
901,JAMIE: They're Cybermen. 
902,"DOCTOR: Jamie, come back. "
903,"PARRY: It is them. Gentlemen, they are perfect. This is unique in"
904,archaeology. 
905,"VINER: No. No, they're moving. We must shut it down. "
906,(Viner moves levers and the Cybermen slow down.) 
907,KLIEG: What are you doing? Keep away from that! 
908,VINER: No! 
909,(Klieg produces a gun.) 
910,KLIEG: Keep away. 
911,DOCTOR: What do you think you're doing? 
912,"KLIEG: I shall not hesitate to kill. For the last time, I'm asking you"
913,to get away from those controls. 
914,VINER: No! 
915,(Klieg shoots Viner.) 
916,"PARRY: Viner! Viner, Viner. "
917,(Klieg moves the levers back to on.) 
918,"PARRY: Viner, you've killed him! "
919,JAMIE: He's mad! 
920,DOCTOR: Jamie! 
921,(The tombs defrost again.) 
922,"PARRY: Haydon dead, now Viner. What kind of a man are you?! "
923,"KLIEG: Back. Keep back! Let's see what happens. As the Professor says,"
924,this is a unique archaeological event. It would be such a pity to miss
925,it.
926,
927, [Central chamber]
928,
929, (Something is moving and beeping inside Victoria's
930,bag as she wakes from her nap.) 
931,VICTORIA: What's happened? 
932,KAFTAN: What? 
933,VICTORIA: The hatch is down. Are they back? 
934,KAFTAN: They are still down there. 
935,VICTORIA: Then why is the hatch down? They won't be able to get up
936,again. 
937,KAFTAN: I shall open it when we are ready. 
938,VICTORIA: When who's ready? You closed it? 
939,KAFTAN: I did. 
940,"VICTORIA: Then you'd better open it again, hadn't you! "
941,"KAFTAN: No, it shall remain closed. "
942,VICTORIA: The Doctor warned me about you. 
943,KAFTAN: That was very clever of him. 
944,VICTORIA: Out of my way! 
945,KAFTAN: Why? 
946,VICTORIA: I'm going to open the hatch. 
947,(Kaftan pokes a gun in Victoria's back.) 
948,"KAFTAN: Stand back! That's better. Now, let's move away from these"
949,"controls. We shall be more comfortable over here, I think. "
950,VICTORIA: But why? Why have you done it? You've trapped your friends
951,down there as well as mine! 
952,KAFTAN: I shall open it when Mister Klieg has completed our plans.
953,"Meanwhile, it is better that they remain undisturbed. If you touch"
954,those controls I shall have to kill you. 
955,(The Cybermat has chewed a hole in Victoria's bag and is trundling
956,across the floor.)
957,
958, [Cavern]
959,
960," JAMIE: You know, Doctor, I have a feeling that"
961,man's planned it all. He knew that that control wouldn't open the
962,hatch. 
963,"DOCTOR: So did I, Jamie. "
964,"JAMIE: You knew, Doctor? "
965,DOCTOR: I wanted to know what he was up to. 
966,"KLIEG: And now you know, Doctor. "
967,PARRY: We know nothing. This is the action of a lunatic. 
968,"KLIEG: Lunatic? Not at all, Professor. A necessary detail, that's all. "
969,PARRY: But why? 
970,"KLIEG: Logic, my dear Professor, logic and power. On Earth the"
971,Brotherhood of Logicians is the greatest man intelligence ever
972,assembled. But that's not enough by itself. We need power. Power to put
973,our ability into action. The Cybermen have this power. I have come here
974,to find it and use it. 
975,PARRY: So that was your motive in financing my expedition. 
976,KLIEG: Precisely. Your complete lack of administration made it ideal
977,for our purpose. 
978,DOCTOR: You think the Cybermen will help you? 
979,KLIEG: Of course. I shall be their resurrector. 
980,PARRY: Look! 
981,(The Cybermen start to rip their way out of their cells and climb down
982,the ladders at either side of the block.)
983,
984, [Central chamber]
985,
986, (Victoria spots the Cybermat.) 
987,KAFTAN: Keep still. 
988,"VICTORIA: Behind you! That thing, it's come alive! "
989,KAFTAN: You are so simple. You don't really expect to take me in with a
990,trick like that? 
991,VICTORIA: It's true. Look! 
992,KAFTAN: Will nothing keep you still? 
993,"VICTORIA: Oh, will you please look! "
994,KAFTAN: If I have any further trouble from you I will have to take
995,drastic steps. 
996,VICTORIA: Why don't you believe me? 
997,KAFTAN: We will not allow a little girl like you to interfere with our
998,plans. 
999,(The Cybermat jumps onto Kaftan's shoulder. She screams. Victoria pulls
1000,"it off and throws it away, then picks up Kaftan's gun and shoots the"
1001,little monster. It blows up and dies. Kaftan is out cold. Victoria
1002,looks at the row of control levers.) 
1003,VICTORIA: I don't know. 
1004,(She puts the gun down on the hatch steps and runs out.) 
1005,VICTORIA: Captain Hopper!

1008,
1009, (The Cybermen ignore the humans and gather in
1010,front of a cyber logo at the base of the wall. They open it to reveal a
1011,slightly different design of Cyberman.) 
1012,JAMIE: What is it? 
1013,"DOCTOR: I think it's their leader, their Controller, Jamie. "
1014,(The Controller steps out of his cell. He has no chest unit and an
1015,extra tall head like a massive brain. The Cybermen salute him.) 
1016,KLIEG: I am Klieg. Eric Klieg. I have brought you back to life. We of
1017,the Logicians have planned this. You are alive because of us. Now you
1018,will help us. We need your power. You need our mass intelligence. Are
1019,you listening? Do you understand me? Now that I have released you 
1020,(The Controller grips Klieg's wrist and forces him to kneel.) 
1021,KLIEG: Aaah! Let me go! I set you free! It was our plan! 
1022,(The Controller tosses Klieg away from him.) 
1023,CONTROLLER: You belong to us. You shall be like us. 
1024, Episode Three
1025,
1026, [Cavern]
1027,
1028, PARRY: How did you know that we would come to
1029,release you? You could have remained frozen forever. 
1030,CONTROLLER: The humanoid mind. You are inquisitive. 
1031,"DOCTOR: Ah, I see, a trap. A very special sort of trap, too. "
1032,"PARRY: What do you mean, special trap? "
1033,"DOCTOR: Well, don't you see? They only wanted superior intellects."
1034,That's why they made the trap so complicated. 
1035,CONTROLLER: We knew that somebody like you would come to our planet one
1036,day. 
1037,"DOCTOR: Yes, and we've done exactly as you've calculated, haven't we? "
1038,CONTROLLER: Now you belong to us.

1040, [Central chamber]
1041,
1042,(Victoria has bought Hopper and Callum from the
1043,rocket. Kaftan is still unconscious.) 
1044,"VICTORIA: Now, quick. Find the opening device. I don't know which it"
1045,is. 
1046,HOPPER: Now hold on. I'm not pulling any levers until I know what this
1047,is all about. 
1048,"CALLUM: I don't reckon we should have left the rocket, Captain. I can't"
1049,see much wrong here. 
1050,"VICTORIA: Not much wrong? Are you blind, the pair of you? What about"
1051,this then? 
1052,(The closed hatch.) 
1053,"CALLUM: I can't see any change, Vic. "
1054,VICTORIA: That's just it. They're down there now. 
1055,CALLUM: Then why close the hatch on them? 
1056,(Kaftan wakes.) 
1057,"CALLUM: It doesn't make sense, Vic. "
1058,VICTORIA: I didn't. And please stop calling me Vic. She closed the
1059,hatch. 
1060,"CALLUM: Oh, did she now? "
1061,"VICTORIA: Now look, are you going to help me or not? They're probably"
1062,"freezing to death down there. If you're not going to help me, I'm going"
1063,to pull every one of those levers on that board and see what happens. 
1064,"HOPPER: Ah now, I wouldn't do that, Vic. Come on, Jim. I think we'd"
1065,better do as she says. 
1066,CALLUM: Yeah. 
1067,"HOPPER: Okay, now. Were you here when they opened it all up? "
1068,VICTORIA: Yes. 
1069,"HOPPER: Well, come on. You must have some idea. "
1070,"VICTORIA: I don't know. I wasn't looking. Oh, I think it's one of those"
1071,levers down there. 
1072,CALLUM: She thinks! 
1073, [Cavern]
1074,
1075," JAMIE: Can we not make a run for it, Doctor? "
1076,"DOCTOR: No, no. We wouldn't even reach the ladder. It's too risky. "
1077,PARRY: What can we do? 
1078,DOCTOR: We'll play for time. Wait our chance. Leave it to me. Excuse
1079,me. May I ask a question? Why did you submit yourself to freezing? You
1080,don't have to answer that if you don't want to. 
1081,CONTROLLER: To survive. Our history computer has full details of you. 
1082,DOCTOR: Oh? How? 
1083,CONTROLLER: We know of your intelligence. 
1084,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you very much. Ah, yes. The lunar surface. "
1085,CONTROLLER: Our machinery had stopped and our supply of replacements
1086,been depleted. 
1087,DOCTOR: So that's why you attacked the Moonbase. 
1088,CONTROLLER: You had destroyed our first planet and we were becoming
1089,extinct. 
1090,JAMIE: What difference does capturing us make? You'll still become
1091,extinct. 
1092,CONTROLLER: We will survive. We will survive. Now you will help us. 
1093,PARRY: What makes you think we're going to help you? That murderer
1094,doesn't speak for us. 
1095,CONTROLLER: You will become the first of a new race of Cybermen. You
1096,will return to the Earth and control it. 
1097,PARRY: Never! Never! 
1098,CONTROLLER: Everything we decide is carried out. There are no mistakes.
1099,
1100,JAMIE: A new race of Cybermen? But we're humans. We're not like you. 
1101,CONTROLLER: You will be. 
1102,"DOCTOR: Oh, no, no. Keep away! Keep away! Keep away from me! "
1103,(The group of Cybermen take hold of the scientists and Toberman. Only
1104,Jamie manages to escape. A Cyberman goes after him but takes the wrong
1105,"turn at a junction. Jamie doubles back to the ladder, and gets zapped"
1106,there.) 
1107,DOCTOR: If only you'd let go I'd stand still. 
1108,"TOBERMAN: Please, please, please let me go! Please, let me go! "
1109,(The Cyberman struggling with Toberman picks him up and throws him into
1110,a pile of barrels.) 
1111,"DOCTOR: If you would let go of me, I can stand still! You're breaking"
1112,my arm!

1117, (Callum is looking at the wiring underneath a
1118,panel.) 
1119,HOPPER: You sure that's the one? 
1120,"CALLUM: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's the only one it could be. Yeah. It leads"
1121,up to that one there. Yeah. 
1122,"VICTORIA: Please hurry, Captain Hopper! "
1123,"HOPPER: Keep back, will you? Leave this to me. Jim, stand by the power"
1124,cut off. 
1125,(Kaftan crawls for her gun.) 
1126,"CALLUM: Power, yeah, yeah. "
1127,"HOPPER: Stand back, will you, just in case we got the wrong one. "
1128,KAFTAN: Don't move! Raise your hands! 
1129,"HOPPER: Now look here, lady. "
1130,KAFTAN: I shall kill you. 
1131,"HOPPER: Well, your own men are down there, remember? What are you doing"
1132,this for? 
1133,KAFTAN: Move away from that control board. Over here. I shall open the
1134,hatch when Klieg gives the signal. 
1135,HOPPER: Well why close it in the first place? 
1136,KAFTAN: Klieg must remain undisturbed. Your friends will not escape
1137,"from there, and you will not interfere. "
1138,(The Cyberman moves into view. Victoria screams and Kaftan looks behind
1139,her. Hopper jumps forward and grabs the gun.) 
1140,"HOPPER: Watch her, Jim. If she moves, blast her. "
1141,CALLUM: Right. 
1142,"HOPPER: Ah, you scream real good, Vic! Thanks a lot. "
1143,"VICTORIA: Please, the hatch! "
1144,"HOPPER: Okay, we'll take a risk. Stand by. "
1145,(Hopper pulls the lever and the hatch opens.) 
1146,VICTORIA: It's very quiet down there. 
1147,"HOPPER: Yeah, too quiet. "
1148,VICTORIA: Something must have happened. 
1149,HOPPER: How long they been down there? 
1150,"VICTORIA: Oh, about an hour. "
1151,"HOPPER: That's too long. I'm going down. Hey, Jim, what are those bombs"
1152,loaded with? 
1153,CALLUM: Smoke. 
1154,"HOPPER: Great. Give us a couple, will you? "
1155,"CALLUM: Yeah, sure. "
1156,"HOPPER: Come on, come on. "
1157,"CALLUM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. "
1158,(Callum takes two grenades from his bag.) 
1159,"HOPPER: Okay, here we go. "
1160,VICTORIA: I'm coming too. 
1161,"HOPPER: Later, maybe. Not this trip. "
1162,VICTORIA: Who'd be a woman. 
1163,"HOPPER: How would you know, honey? You'd better stay up here. We don't"
1164,know what's going on down there. 
1165,(Hopper goes down through the hatch.) 
1166,VICTORIA: Is he always like that? 
1167,"CALLUM: Most of the time, Vic, yeah."

1174,KLIEG: Yes? 
1175,CONTROLLER: You are a logician. Our race is also logical. You will be
1176,the leader of the new race. 
1177,KLIEG: You will listen to my proposals then? 
1178,"CONTROLLER: Yes, we will listen, but first you will be altered. "
1179,KLIEG: Altered? 
1180,CONTROLLER: You have fear. We will eliminate fear from your brain. Yes.
1181,You will be the first. 
1182,CYBERMAN: And you will be the next. 
1183,"PARRY: I? No, no! "
1184,CYBERMAN: You will be like us.
1185,(Hopper takes the pin from a smoke grenade.) 
1186,CONTROLLER: To die is unnecessary. You will be frozen and placed in our
1187,tombs until we are ready to use you. Your lives will be suspended.
1188,Prepare the tombs. 
1189,PARRY: They really mean it. They're going to freeze us. 
1190,JAMIE: Not me. 
1191,"DOCTOR: No, Jamie. They're coming back. "

1200,"JAMIE: Aye, I think so. Which way is it? I can't remember. "
1201,DOCTOR: That way. 
1202,JAMIE: Are you sure? 
1203,"DOCTOR: No, I'm not sure, but try it. I'll be with you in a minute. "
1204,JAMIE: All right.

1206,right.)

1209,"DOCTOR: No, we can't do that. The hatch. We must get there first. Come"

1231,"HOPPER: The Cybermen, they're right behind us. "
1232,"(The Doctor makes it to the ladder and starts climbing, but there is a"
1233,Cyberman right behind him.)

1241,the thermos from the table and starts hitting the cyber man's arm with
1242,"it. It lets go of the Doctor and grabs Victoria instead, leaning half"
1243,out of the hatch.) 
1244,"HOPPER: Jim, close the hatch! "
1245,JAMIE: Victoria!

1270, PARRY: Don't open it. It may be the Cybermen. 
1271,"DOCTOR: No. No, it's too soft. It must be Toberman and Klieg. "
1272,"HOPPER: Ah, you're crazy. "
1273,"PARRY: You're right. We can't leave them down there, even if they are"
1274,killers.

1276,(More knocking.) 
1277,KAFTAN: You must let them up. They must be saved.

1287,KLIEG: They've got him. 
1288,"DOCTOR: Do you still think you can form an alliance with the Cybermen,"
1289,Mister Klieg? 
1290,KLIEG: If I'd only been in a stronger position to bargain with them. 
1291,"PARRY: You must be out of your mind, Klieg. "
1292,HOPPER: You're not in any position to bargain with anybody right now.
1293,"Well, what are we going to do with him? "
1294,PARRY: I'd feel much happier if they weren't left in here. 
1295,"DOCTOR: Well, what about the testing room? There's only one door. They"
1296,can't get out. 
1297,PARRY: That's a good idea. They'll be quite safe in there. 
1298,HOPPER: Callum. 
1299,CALLUM: Right. Mister Klieg? Miss Kaftan? 
1300,"HOPPER: Now, if I don't get back to the rocket, we're not going to take"
1301,off inside a week.

1317,CONTROLLER: Activate them. The brain of this humanoid will be their
1318,target. Now. 
1319,"(The foot or so long devices are put on the floor near Toberman, but"
1320,they don't move.) 
1321,CONTROLLER: These Cybermats are dormant through lack of use. Inspect
1322,them. 
1323, [Testing room]
1324,
1325,(Something falls from the dummy Cyberman to the
1326,floor.) 
1327,KLIEG: What's that? 
1328,KAFTAN: Just me. 
1329,"KLIEG: Oh, be quiet. "
1330,KAFTAN: Sleep later. Look at this. 
1331,KLIEG: What is it? 
1332,"KAFTAN: One of the weapons they were testing. Look, here's the"
1333,connection. 
1334,"KLIEG: Let me see. Oh yes, you're right. It's a Cybergun. Take a look"
1335,at that control. See that everything is switched off. 
1336,KAFTAN: Right. All the sequences show negative. 
1337,KLIEG: Good. Now they will have to listen. 
1338,(Klieg gets out a pair of pliers and starts work on the gun.)
1339,
1340, [Cavern]
1341,
1342, CYBERMAN: The Cybermats are ready. 
1343,CONTROLLER: Stand clear. Now. 
1344,(This time the Cybermats trundle towards Toberman.)
1345,
1346, [Testing room]
1347,
1348, (Klieg has removed the Cybergun from the dummy. He
1349,test fires it at a wall. The metal melts and burns.) 
1350,KLIEG: Excellent. A small X-Ray laser. 
1351,KAFTAN: What are you going to do now? 
1352,"KLIEG: Take command, of course. What do you think? With this I shall be"
1353,able to deal with those people in there. 
1354,KAFTAN: Never mind about them. The important thing for us is to control
1355,the Cybermen. 
1356,"KLIEG: Yes, I know but "
1357,"KAFTAN: Isn't it, Eric? "
1358,KLIEG: You haven't been down there. You haven't seen those vile things.
1359,
1360,"KAFTAN: You're not scared, are you? "
1361,KLIEG: I have completely underestimated their power. 
1362,"KAFTAN: But this time we have the power, at least you do. The gun,"
1363,"Eric, the gun. You have the Cybermen's own weapon, this laser to turn"
1364,"against them. Now they will have to obey. If they refuse, we shall"
1365,destroy the opening device and seal them up in their tomb forever. Now
1366,do you understand? 
1367,"KLIEG: Yes. Yes, you're right. I am invulnerable with this. I shall be"
1368,master. 
1369,"KAFTAN: Come, let us deal with these people first. Eric? "
1370,KLIEG: Master. The supreme moment in my life. It was logical. 
1371,"KAFTAN: Eric, we have work to do. "
1372,"KLIEG: Yes, yes, of course. But hardly work, more a pleasure. "
1373,KAFTAN: What? 
1374,KLIEG: The pleasure to test this on that Doctor and his companions. The
1375,"others are of no consequence, but he will make a most precise target. "
1376, [Cavern]
1377,
1378, CONTROLLER: Enough. These humanoids are not like
1379,us. They still have fear. Place the Cybermats on the runway. 
1380,(The Cybermats are put on a small ramp leading into a hole in the
1381,wall.) 
1382,CONTROLLER: Cybermats will attack.
1383,
1384, [Central chamber] 
1385," (Everyone is asleep except Victoria, who has the"
1386,gun. The Doctor yawns and Victoria turns the weapon on him. He raises
1387,his arms in surrender.) 
1388,"DOCTOR: I'm on your side, remember? Hey, why didn't you wake me? I"
1389,should have been on watch half an hour ago. 
1390,VICTORIA: I thought you should rest. 
1391,DOCTOR: Why me? 
1392,VICTORIA: No reason really. 
1393,"DOCTOR: Oh, I think I know. Is it because I'm "
1394,"VICTORIA: Well, if you are 450 years old, you need a great deal of"
1395,sleep. 
1396,"DOCTOR: Well that's very considerate of you, Victoria, but between you"
1397,"and me, I'm really quite lively actually, all things being considered. "
1398,(The Doctor takes the gun.) 
1399,"DOCTOR: Are you happy with us, Victoria? "
1400,"VICTORIA: Yes, I am. At least, I would be if my father were here. "
1401,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know, I know. "
1402,VICTORIA: I wonder what he would have thought if he could see me now. 
1403,"DOCTOR: You miss him very much, don't you? "
1404,VICTORIA: It's only when I close my eyes. I can still see him standing
1405,"there, before those horrible Dalek creatures came to the house. He was"
1406,"a very kind man, I shall never forget him. Never. "
1407,"DOCTOR: No, of course you won't. But, you know, the memory of him won't"
1408,always be a sad one. 
1409,"VICTORIA: I think it will. You can't understand, being so ancient. "
1410,DOCTOR: Eh? 
1411,VICTORIA: I mean old. 
1412,DOCTOR: Oh. 
1413,VICTORIA: You probably can't remember your family. 
1414,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, I can when I want to. And that's the point, really. I"
1415,"have to really want to, to bring them back in front of my eyes. The"
1416,"rest of the time they sleep in my mind, and I forget. And so will you."
1417,"Oh yes, you will. You'll find there's so much else to think about. So"
1418,"remember, our lives are different to anybody else's. That's the"
1419,exciting thing. There's nobody in the universe can do what we're doing.
1420,You must get some sleep and let this poor old man stay awake. 
1421,(A Cybermat has entered the room. The Doctor puts his cloak around
1422,Victoria as she settles by the table. The metal creature homes in on
1423,his shoe and he feels it's bump.) 
1424,"DOCTOR: Jamie, Victoria, Callum, wake up. Wake up! "
1425,JAMIE: What? 
1426,VICTORIA: What is it? 
1427,(A second Cybermat jumps onto Callum's chest.) 
1428,DOCTOR: Callum. Callum! 
1429,VICTORIA: It's one of those terrible things again. 
1430,"DOCTOR: Don't move, Callum. Don't move. "
1431,(The Doctor knocks the Cybermat off Callum's chest and helps him up.) 
1432,"DOCTOR: Now get back to the controls, all of you. Steady, don't make"
1433,"any sudden movements. Parry, Parry. Wake up, Parry. Wake up. Wake up."
1434,Don't panic. Come back with us. Steady. Now we'll all go in the other
1435,room and lock them out. 
1436,(Victoria screams. The first Cybermat is heading for them.) 
1437,"CALLUM: Let's get out of here. The main doors. No, look. "
1438,(The third Cybermat is there.) 
1439,"VICTORIA: Oh Doctor, we're trapped. "
1440,"DOCTOR: Back against the controls, everybody. "
1441,(The Doctor picks up the big power cable he was sleeping against.) 
1442,"DOCTOR: Here. Five me a hand, quick. "
1443,PARRY: What? 
1444,DOCTOR: Lay this down on the ground. Come on! 
1445,"JAMIE: They'll go over it, Doctor. "
1446,DOCTOR: Come on! 
1447,(The Doctor lays the cable in an arc in front of the control panel.) 
1448,CALLUM: Let's blast the filthy things! 
1449,"(Callum puts three bullets into a Cybermat, wrecking it.) "
1450,"DOCTOR: You're wasting your time. There are too many of them. Now, do"
1451,what I say. Come back! 
1452,(The Doctor puts power through the cable. It smokes and the Cybermats
1453,start spinning.) 
1454,"DOCTOR: There you are, you see. "
1455,PARRY: What are those creatures? 
1456,"DOCTOR: Well, they're a form of metallic life. They home on human"
1457,brainwaves and attack. 
1458,(The Cybermats have all keeled over and stopped moving.) 
1459,VICTORIA: Are they safe now? 
1460,"DOCTOR: Yes, quite safe now. The power cable generated an electrical"
1461,field and confused their tiny metal minds. You might almost say that
1462,they've had a complete metal breakdown. 
1463,(Jamie groans.) 
1464,"DOCTOR: I'm so sorry, Jamie. "
1465,VICTORIA: What about Klieg and Kaftan? They've probably attacked them
1466,as well. 
1467,PARRY: The testing room. 
1468,DOCTOR: Come on. Now mind your feet. 
1469,"KLIEG: Most ingenious, Doctor. Now, let's see what you can do against"
1470,this. 
1471,(Klieg raises the Cybergun.) 
1472,"CALLUM: Watch out, Doctor! "
1473,(Klieg fires the Cybergun.) 
1474, Episode Four
1475,
1476, [Central chamber]
1477,
1478, (Victoria screams. Callum falls to the floor
1479,clutching his shoulder. Everyone else is already on the floor. Parry
1480,goes to help Callum.) 
1481,KLIEG: Keep back! Your gun. 
1482,(Klieg hands Parry's gun to Kaftan.) 
1483,"PARRY: You've killed him, you murderer. "
1484,"KLIEG: No, he is fortunate, I spared him. "
1485,JAMIE: You mean you missed him. 
1486,KLIEG: Silence. I could have destroyed him if I wanted to. Shall I kill
1487,them now? 
1488,"KAFTAN: No, no, that will not be necessary. I'm sure the Cybermen will"
1489,have a good use for them. You will make excellent experimental
1490,specimens. 
1491,"VICTORIA: Oh, let me help him, please. "
1492,KLIEG: No tricks. 
1493,DOCTOR: You still think you can bargain with the Cybermen? 
1494,KLIEG: Certainly. And this time on our terms. 
1495,(Klieg opens the hatch and shouts down through it.) 
1496,KLIEG: I wish to speak to the Controller. I wish to speak to the
1497,Controller!
1498,
1499, [Cavern] 
1500, KLIEG : I wish to speak to the Controller! 
1501,CONTROLLER: The humanoids must first be destroyed. You will re-enter
1502,cells to conserve energy. 
1503,CYBERMAN: He is now prepared. 
1504,CONTROLLER: Release him. 
1505,"(Toberman sits up, staring at nothing and with a metal-looking arm. The"
1506,Cybermen climb back into their tombs and seal themselves up again.)
1507,
1508, [Central chamber]
1509,
1510," KLIEG: They're coming. And now, gentlemen, you"
1511,will see how I shall use the power of the Cybermen. 
1512,"DOCTOR: Use maybe, but you'll never control the Cybermen. "
1513,"KAFTAN: Eric, behind you! "
1514,KLIEG: Stop. You know what this can do to you. 
1515,(The Controller stands at the top of the ladder with Toberman behind
1516,him.) 
1517,KLIEG: That's better. Now you are under my control. We know you must be
1518,"revitalised or you will perish. If you agree to my terms, I shall let"
1519,you survive. 
1520,CONTROLLER: I will listen. 
1521,KAFTAN: Make them release Toberman. 
1522,"JAMIE: If you think they'll listen to you, you're even dafter than I"
1523,thought. 
1524,"KLIEG: Silence. Sit down. First, you release our man. "
1525,(The Controller's brain send energy into Toberman's head. Toberman
1526,"walks out of the hatchway, not looking where he is putting his feet.) "
1527,"KAFTAN: Toberman, it is good that you are back. Watch them. "
1528,"JAMIE: Doctor, he seems er "
1529,"DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, yes. "
1530,(The Controller is coming down the steps.) 
1531,"KLIEG: Stay where you are! Now, do you agree to accept our plan? "
1532,DOCTOR: Plan? 
1533,KLIEG: The conquest of the Earth. 
1534,PARRY: What? You must be out of your mind. 
1535,KLIEG: Silence! Your answer? 
1536,CONTROLLER: We accept. We will give you some of our power devices. 
1537,KLIEG: Good. I knew an understanding could be reached. I shall let you
1538,"be revitalised. To survive, it must be now. Come forward. Slowly. "
1539,"KAFTAN: Eric, be careful. "
1540,KLIEG: Leave this to me. 
1541,(The Controller goes to the door to the power room.) 
1542,PARRY: You're absolutely crazy to trust them! 
1543,KLIEG: Do you think so? Then perhaps you and your colleagues had better
1544,"join him. Go on, go on! "
1545,KLIEG: The girl stays with us! 
1546,DOCTOR: No! 
1547,"KLIEG: Any trouble, she is our hostage. "
1548,(Klieg closes the door to the power room on them.) 
1549,KLIEG: Close the hatch. 
1550,(Toberman doesn't move.) 
1551,"KAFTAN: Go on, close it. "
1552,(Toberman still doesn't move so Kaftan does it herself.)
1553,
1554, [Projector room] 
1555, (The Controller is trying to get into the Cyberman
1556,shaped recess where Victoria got herself trapped.) 
1557,JAMIE: He's too weak to get in. 
1558,"DOCTOR: Quiet, Jamie. "
1559,(The Doctor goes over to the Controller.) 
1560,DOCTOR: You seem to be in trouble. 
1561,CONTROLLER: The energy levels are low. We will survive. You will help
1562,us. You will help us. 
1563,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, certainly. Jamie, Professor. "
1564,JAMIE: You don't mean to say you're actually going to help them? 
1565,PARRY: Surely not? You can't support these creatures. 
1566,DOCTOR: I think it best. Come on. Come along. 
1567,(They help the Controller into the recess.) 
1568,DOCTOR: That's it. Up and in. 
1569,CONTROLLER: (winding down) Do you understand the machine? 
1570,DOCTOR: Yes. One moment. 
1571,JAMIE: Have you taken leave of your senses? Now let's go and help
1572,Victoria. 
1573,"DOCTOR: In a moment, Jamie. Now, are you ready? "
1574,(The projector head swings up and down and the recess door closes on
1575,the Controller.) 
1576,CONTROLLER: We will survive. We will sur 
1577,"DOCTOR: Now then, where would you rather have him, in or out of there? "
1578,"JAMIE: Oh, I see what you mean. "
1579,DOCTOR: Only we must make sure that he stays in there.
1580,
1581, [Central chamber]
1582,
1583,(Victoria has put Callum's arm in a sling.) 
1584,VICTORIA: Do you really believe you can bargain with those terrible
1585,Cybermen? 
1586,"KAFTAN: That is our concern, not yours. "
1587,"VICTORIA: I'm talking to him, not you. "
1588,KLIEG: They will have to agree to our plan. 
1589,VICTORIA: What about the other weapon? 
1590,KLIEG: What other weapon? 
1591,"VICTORIA: Well, I saw another one like that in that room over there. "
1592,KLIEG: Is that true? 
1593,KAFTAN: I don't know. We'd better make sure. 
1594,"KLIEG: No, wait. That means that any one of them in there could "
1595,"KAFTAN: Yes, you're right, Eric. "
1596,"KLIEG: Better wait here. If the Cyberman is aroused, we shall be ready"
1597,for him. Now stay well clear. Take no chances. 
1598,(Toberman is staring at Klieg.)
1599,
1600, [Projector room]
1601,
1602, (The recess lid has been tied down. The projector
1603,"head is still swinging up and down, and has started to overheat.) "
1604,"PARRY: Keep back, it's smoking. "
1605,JAMIE: I told you we shouldn't have touched it. 
1606,"PARRY: Yes, turn it off. It's out of control. "
1607,(The projector stops.) 
1608,PARRY: It's taken over. 
1609,DOCTOR: I think not. I think there must be some sort of internal timing
1610,"mechanism. Jamie, I hope you made those ropes secure. "
1611,"JAMIE: Oh, the King of the beasties himself couldnae get out of that"
1612,one. 
1613,DOCTOR: Good! 
1614,(So the re-energised Controller punches his way out easily.) 
1615,"DOCTOR: Jamie, remind me to give you a lesson in tying knots sometime. "
1616,CONTROLLER: You will remain still. 
1617,(The Controller transmits strong energy waves through the walls to
1618,Toberman.)
1619,
1620, [Central chamber]
1621,
1622, KLIEG: Stay here and watch that door. At least now
1623,we will have some warning. 
1624,CALLUM: What do you two hope to gain from all this? 
1625,KLIEG: That does not concern you. 
1626,(Klieg puts the Cybergun down on the table.) 
1627,"KAFTAN: Oh, they might as well know, Eric. We are going to build a"
1628,better world. 
1629,"CALLUM: Better? Well, who for? "
1630,(Toberman approaches Klieg.) 
1631,KLIEG: I told you to watch that door. 
1632,(Toberman hits Klieg with his cyberarm.) 
1633,KAFTAN: Toberman! 
1634,"(The Doctor, Jamie, Parry and the Controller enter. It picks up the"
1635,Cybergun.) 
1636,JAMIE: Victoria! 
1637,VICTORIA: What's going on? 
1638,CONTROLLER: You have done well. 
1639,KAFTAN: Toberman! 
1640,CONTROLLER: Silence. He is now under our control. Open the tombs. 
1641,KAFTAN: No. You have broken your promise. 
1642,CONTROLLER: Cybermen do not promise. Such ideas have no value. Open. 
1643,KAFTAN: No. 
1644,"(The Controller looks as if he is going to shoot Kaftan, but opens the"
1645,"hatch instead. As it walks away, Kaftan shuts it again and gets a gun"
1646,from her bag. She fires.) 
1647,CONTROLLER: That gun will not harm me. 
1648,(Kaftan fires again and the Controller kills her. Then it opens the
1649,hatch again. The Doctor goes over to Toberman. The Controller calls
1650,down the hatchway.) 
1651,DOCTOR: Look what they've done. You're not like them. You're a man like
1652,us. You must help us! He has killed Kaftan! You must help us. 
1653,CONTROLLER: You will report to the surface. 
1654,"(Toberman attacks the Controller, and it drops the Cybergun for Jamie"
1655,to pick up as they struggle. Then Toberman lifts the Controller over
1656,his head and throws it onto the control panel in a shower of sparks.) 
1657,"DOCTOR: Jamie, the hatch! "
1658,(A Cyberman is climbing up the ladder.) 
1659,"DOCTOR: The gun, Jamie! "
1660,(Jamie shoots the Cyberman and it expires in a cloud of smoke. He
1661,pushes its remains down the ladder.) 
1662,"JAMIE: There's another one, Doctor! "
1663,(Jamie fires down the ladder.) 
1664,DOCTOR: Are there any more? 
1665,"JAMIE: No, it's gone quiet. I'll close the hatch. "
1666,"DOCTOR: No, wait a minute. I'd better go down there. "
1667,"VICTORIA: Oh, no, no, not again. "
1668,DOCTOR: It's the only way to make sure. 
1669,JAMIE: Then I'll go with you. 
1670,"DOCTOR: No, wait. You stay and look after Victoria. I'll take somebody"
1671,else. 
1672,(Toberman is cradling Kaftan's body.) 
1673,"DOCTOR: Toberman, you see what these creatures have done to you?"
1674,They've tried to make you like them. Do you understand? They've tried
1675,to make you their slave. They just want to use you. They are evil.
1676,Think of Kaftan. 
1677,TOBERMAN: Evil! 
1678,"DOCTOR: They must be destroyed, do you see? Evil must be destroyed,"
1679,"Now, come! "
1680,TOBERMAN: Destroy! 
1681,DOCTOR: Come! Come on! Come on! 
1682,(Klieg pretends to be unconscious as the Doctor leads Toberman to the
1683,hatch then lets him go first.) 
1684,PARRY: Good luck. 
1685,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
1686,"JAMIE: Doctor, the gun. "
1687,DOCTOR: I shan't need that. 
1688,(The Doctor goes down the ladder.) 
1689,JAMIE: He should have taken it. 
1690,"VICTORIA: Oh, poor Mister Callum. How are you feeling? "
1691,CALLUM: I can't move my arm. I can't move it. 
1692,(Klieg takes the Cybergun and goes down the hatch while everyone is
1693,with Callum.)
1694,
1695, [Cavern] 
1696," DOCTOR: Move quietly. They're all dormant, see. "
1697,TOBERMAN: Evil! 
1698,(Toberman hits a piece of equipment.) 
1699,"DOCTOR: No! Quietly. They're only asleep. They're not frozen yet. Now,"
1700,"you watch them. I have things to do. Now, let me see. "
1701,(The Doctor presses some buttons.) 
1702,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1703,(The Doctor pulls levers.) 
1704,KLIEG: The cryostat! You're freezing them! 
1705,DOCTOR: Klieg! 
1706,(Klieg reverses the levers.) 
1707,DOCTOR: No! No! You'll wake them up! 
1708,"KLIEG: That is exactly my intention. You still don't understand, do"
1709,you? Their Controller is dead. Now I shall control them. They'll do
1710,"what I say. You see, Doctor, yours is the privilege to witness for the"
1711,first time the union between mass power and my absolute intelligence.
1712,Who's that? Come out. Come out or I shall kill this man. 
1713,(Jamie enters.) 
1714,"KLIEG: It's you. Over to that wall, all of you. All of you! Now. "
1715,"DOCTOR: Yes, as you say, such a combination between intelligence and"
1716,power would make you formidable indeed. Why you'd be commander of the
1717,universe with your brilliance! It makes the imagination reel with the
1718,possibilities! 
1719,"KLIEG: Why, Doctor, if I had only known you shared my imagination, you"
1720,might even have worked for me. 
1721,DOCTOR: Perhaps it's not too late? 
1722,JAMIE: Doctor! 
1723,"DOCTOR: No, Jamie, don't you see? "
1724,(The Cybermen are waking but Klieg has his back to them.) 
1725,DOCTOR: Don't you see what this is going to all mean to all the people
1726,"who come to serve Klieg the All Powerful? Why, no country, no person"
1727,would dare to have a single thought that was not your own. Eric Klieg's
1728,"own conception of the, of the way of life! "
1729,"KLIEG: Brilliant! Yes, yes, you're right. Master of the world. "
1730,DOCTOR: Well now I know you're mad. I just wanted to make sure. 
1731, [Central chamber]
1732,
1733," HOPPER: Well, the fuel system's okay. We can blast"
1734,off any time. 
1735,PARRY: All right. 
1736,"HOPPER: Hey, what gives? Well, where is everybody? "
1737,PARRY: Down there. And so are Klieg and the Cybermen. 
1738,"HOPPER: Well, I hope they know what they're doing. I've been down there"
1739,once and I don't reckon to go again. 
1740,"VICTORIA: That's all right, Captain. It's comforting to know that we"
1741,"have your superior strength to call on, should we need it. "
1742, [Cavern]
1743,
1744, KLIEG: And so you have forfeited your right to
1745,survival. I shall make an example of you to all who question my
1746,"intelligence, and the supreme power of the Cybermen. "
1747,"DOCTOR: You know, I've heard all this before somewhere. "
1748,JAMIE: You know your trouble? You talk too much. 
1749,"KLIEG: Oh, you're stupid. You still think that your puny minds can"
1750,"survive against us? You're decadent, weak. Do you know that? Weak! "
1751,"DOCTOR: All right. Go ahead, kill us. "
1752,"KLIEG: No, I have a better idea. Much better idea. I shall leave you to"
1753,the Cybermen. I'm sure they'll have some use for you. Or parts of you. 
1754,"(A Cyberman grabs Klieg and beats him to death, then goes to the"
1755,control panel. Toberman tackles him.) 
1756,DOCTOR: Quick Jamie. These two levers together. 
1757,JAMIE: I can't shift this one. 
1758,DOCTOR: What? You've got to trip that first. 
1759,(The Cyberman and Toberman are evenly matched. Finally Toberman gets it
1760,on its back and smashes open the chest unit. Foam oozes out.) 
1761,DOCTOR: Last time they were frozen for five centuries. This time it
1762,must be forever. 
1763,(The Doctor and Jamie leave as the remaining Cybermen finish sealing
1764,themselves in their tombs and the ice covers the cavern walls again.)
1765,
1766, [Central chamber]
1767,
1768," VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor! "
1769,"DOCTOR: Here we are, Victoria, safe and sound. Close the hatch. "
1770,(The hatch closes.) 
1771,"DOCTOR: There we are. Now then. Now, the best thing about a machine"
1772,"that makes sense, you can very easily make it turn out nonsense. "
1773,(The Doctor adjusts the wiring in the main panel that Callum had
1774,opened.)
1775,DOCTOR: There we are. Now I think you'd better all go outside. 
1776,"PARRY: Why, what are you going to do, Doctor? "
1777,DOCTOR: I'm going to re-electrify the main doors. 
1778,PARRY: Yes? 
1779,DOCTOR: Only this time I'm going to include the hatch and the control
1780,panel. 
1781,PARRY: Yes. 
1782,DOCTOR: Anyone touching any of them will get a considerable shock. In
1783,"fact, a fatal one. "
1784,PARRY: I see. 
1785,"DOCTOR: Now, everyone outside. And please take him with you, I shall be"
1786,glad to see him outside. 
1787,VICTORIA: Jamie? 
1788,"JAMIE: No, I'll stay with the Doctor. "
1789,"VICTORIA: Oh, all right. "
1790,(Everyone leaves as the Controller's hand moves.) 
1791,"DOCTOR: There we are. That's done. Now, we just have to close the main"
1792,doors and the circuit is complete. 
1793,"JAMIE: Oh, thank goodness for that. "
1794,(They check the hatch is firmly closed.) 
1795,JAMIE: Doctor. Doctor! 
1796,(The Controller is back on its feet.) 
1797,"DOCTOR: Jamie, you go that way, I'll go this way. That way will give us"
1798,"more of a chance. When I say run, run. "
1799,(They start to circle the table.) 
1800,DOCTOR: Run! 
1801,(The Controller tries to grab the Doctor as Jamie runs behind it to the
1802,main doors with the Doctor right behind.)
1803,
1804, [Tomb entrance] 
1805, (Jamie and the Doctor start to push the metal
1806,doors closed.) 
1807,DOCTOR: Quickly. Wait! Stop! 
1808,JAMIE: What? 
1809,"DOCTOR: We'll get a shock. We must find something to insulate. I know,"
1810,"that shoring timber over there! Hurry up! Hurry up, he's coming! "
1811,(Jamie comes back with the wood to push the doors shut as a Cybermat
1812,scuttles out between their feet.) 
1813,"JAMIE: Okay, Doctor! "
1814,DOCTOR: Quickly! We must keep him inside or else all our work'll be
1815,wasted. 
1816,JAMIE: I can't hold mine. Come on! 
1817,DOCTOR: You must do! 
1818,(Toberman pushes them aside and pits his strength against that of the
1819,Controller trying to push the doors open.) 
1820,JAMIE: Toberman! 
1821,CONTROLLER: We must survive. We must survive. 
1822,TOBERMAN: You are evil! 
1823,(The doors start to close.) 
1824,"DOCTOR: Toberman, come away! "
1825,"JAMIE: Careful, you'll get killed, man!"
1826,
1827, [Central chamber]
1828,
1829, TOBERMAN: They shall never pass Toberman. The door
1830,is closed. 
1831,"(As the metal doors meet fully, electricity burns through the"
1832,"Controller and it falls to the floor, smoking and writhing.)"
1833,
1834,[Tomb entrance]
1835,
1836, (Toberman slides to the ground.) 
1837,PARRY: How terrible. Another life gone. 
1838,"HOPPER: Come on, Professor. Blast off in nine minutes. Well, anybody"
1839,coming along for the ride? 
1840,VICTORIA: We have our own flying machine. 
1841,HOPPER: Flying machine? 
1842,VICTORIA: At least it works. 
1843,"HOPPER: Oh, let's go. "
1844,"PARRY: Right. Well, goodbye, Doctor. "
1845,DOCTOR: Goodbye. 
1846,PARRY: I'm sorry it had to end 
1847,DOCTOR: I know. I know. Goodbye. 
1848,(Hopper and Parry leave.) 
1849,"JAMIE: Now, that really is the end of the Cybermen, isn't it? "
1850,"DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie. On the other hand, I never like to make"
1851,predictions. Come along. 
1852,(The Cybermat watches them go.)
