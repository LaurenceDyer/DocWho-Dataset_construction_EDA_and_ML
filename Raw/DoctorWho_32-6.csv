21, (The new Doctor is suffering.) 
22,"G-DOCTOR: Argh. What's happening? I wonder if we'll get back. Yes, one"
23,day. Argh. I've reversed the polarity of the neutron flow. 
24,DOCTOR: The Flesh is struggling to cope with our past regenerations.
25,Hold on. 
26,DOCTOR 4 : Would you like a jelly baby? 
27,G-DOCTOR: Why? Why? Why? 
28,DOCTOR: Why what? 
29,"G-DOCTOR: Hello. I'm the Doctor. No, let it go, we've moved on. "
30,"DOCTOR: Hold on, hold on, you can stabilise. "
31,G-DOCTOR: I've reversed the jelly baby of the neutron flow. Would you
32,"like a Doctor, Doctor, I'm, I'm the. I can't. "
33,"DOCTOR: No, listen, hold on. Hold on. "
34,G-DOCTOR: No! Argh. 
35,(The other Gangers are trying to batter their way in. Then it all goes
36,quiet.) 
37,BUZZER: I think I liked it best when they were being noisy. 
38,"AMY: Mmm hmm. Doctor, we need you. Get over here. "
39,G-DOCTOR: Hello. 
40,AMY: Doctor. 
41,DOCTOR: Cybermats. 
42,G-DOCTOR: Do we have time for this? 
43,DOCTOR: We make time. I'd like more proof that you're me. Cybermats. 
44,G-DOCTOR: Created by the Cybermen. They kill by feeding off brainwaves.
45,
46,"AMY: Are you sure there aren't any weapons to can get to, like big guns"
47,with bits on? 
48,"BUZZER: Yeah, big guns would be good right now. "
49,JIMMY: Why would we have guns? We're a factory. We mine. 
50,AMY: Acid. 
51,(The door starts to dissolve and the Gangers recommence their
52,battering.) 
53,"DOCTOR: Rory and Amy, they may not trust both of us. "
54,G-DOCTOR: Are you thinking what I'm thinking? 
55,DOCTOR: Inevitably. 
56,G-DOCTOR: I'm glad we're on the same 
57,"DOCTOR: Wavelength. You see, great minds. "
58,"G-DOCTOR: Exactly. So, what's the plan? "
59,"DOCTOR: Save them all, humans and gangers. "
60,G-DOCTOR: Tall order. Sounds wonderful. 
61,DOCTOR: Is that what you were thinking? It's just so inspiring to hear
62,me say it. 
63,G-DOCTOR: I know. 
64,"AMY: Doctor, come on. "
65,"G-DOCTOR: So, what now, Doctor? "
66,"DOCTOR: Well, time to get cracking, Doctor. "
67,"BOTH: Hello. Sorry, but we had to establish a few ground rules. "
68,DOCTOR: Formulate a protocol. 
69,G-DOCTOR: Protocol? Very posh. 
70,DOCTOR: A protocol between us. Otherwise 
71,G-DOCTOR: It gets horribly embarrassing. 
72,DOCTOR: And potentially confusing. 
73,AMY: I'm glad you've solved the problem of confusing. 
74,G-DOCTOR: That's sarcasm. 
75,DOCTOR: She's very good at sarcasm. 
76,BOTH: Breathe. 
77,AMY: What? 
78,DOCTOR: We have to get you off this island. And the Gangers too. 
79,"CLEAVES: Sorry, would you like a memo from the last meeting? They are"
80,trying to kill us! 
81,DOCTOR: They're scared. 
82,"AMY: Doctor, we're trapped in here. "
83,"DOCTOR: Right, See, I don't think so. The Flesh Bowl is fed by cabling"
84,from above. 
85,G-DOCTOR: But where are the earthing conduits? 
86,DOCTOR: All this piping must go down into a tunnel or a shaft or
87,"something, yes? With us? "
88,(He finds a grating in the wall.) 
89,DOCTOR: Yowza. An escape route. 
90,AMY: Yowza? 
91,"DOCTOR: You know, I'm starting to get a sense of just how impressive it"
92,is to hang out with me. 
93,G-DOCTOR: Do we tend to say yowza? 
94,"DOCTOR: That's enough, let it go, okay? We're under stress. "
95,"(When the armoured Gangers break in, the Doctor is sonicking the"
96,grating shut again. The two Cleaves stare at each other briefly.)
97,
98,[Monastery]
99,
100,"G-JENNIFER: Stop. Stop. Stop, stop. "
101,(Rory watches her go.) 
102,[Corridor]
103,
104,BUZZER: The army will send a recon team our. 
105,CLEAVES: We need to find a way to contact the mainland. 
106,AMY: What about Rory and Jen? They are both out there. 
107,"DOCTOR: No, this place is a maze. Takes a long time to find someone in"
108,"a maze. I bet you lot have got a computer map, haven't you? "
109,"CLEAVES: If we can get power running, we can scan for them. Be a lot"
110,quicker. 
111,(They start coughing.) 
112,"AMY: Doctor, you said earlier to breathe. "
113,"DOCTOR: Very important, Pond. Breathe. "
114,"AMY: Yeah, well, I'm struggling to. "
115,DOCTOR: Acid interacting with the stone. 
116,G-DOCTOR: Creating an asphyxiant miasma. 
117,CLEAVES: A what? 
118,DOCTOR: Choking gas. Extra heavy. If we can get above it. 
119,CLEAVES: The evac tower. It's this way.
120,
121,[Chapel]
122,
123,"G-CLEAVES: Oh, damned headaches. I'm so tired. "
124,G-JIMMY: They could be anywhere. How are we going to find them? 
125,"G-CLEAVES: Think about it. With all that gas out there, my guess would"
126,"be the evac tower. Get above it, try to get power up. "
127,G-JIMMY: So? Let's stop them. 
128,G-CLEAVES: It's a narrow doorway. I could defend it easy enough. So can
129,she. Ow.
130,
131,[Evac tower]
132,
133,"AMY: Oh. I think I coughed so hard, I pulled a"
134,"muscle or something. It's okay, it's better. It's easing off. "
135,(The church bell starts ringing.) 
136,JIMMY: It's midnight. It's Adam's birthday. My son's five. Happy
137,"birthday, bud. "
138,[Chapel]
139,
140,"G-JIMMY: Happy birthday, Adam. He'll be so excited."
141,"Out of bed at the crack of dawn. It's funny, he's got this wee dance he"
142,does when he gets over-excited. 
143,"G-JENNIFER: Listen to me. I tried to block the memories, but now I know"
144,I must remember. It's the eyes. The eyes are the last to go. 
145,G-JIMMY: What are you talking about? 
146,"G-JENNIFER: When they destroy us, the eyes are the last things to melt."
147,And there's one question in those eyes. Why? Why should we suffer for
148,the sake of human beings? 
149,G-DICKEN: I heard in India there's over ten million Gangers. 
150,G-JENNIFER: We can reach out. Inspire them to rise up. 
151,"G-CLEAVES: Revolution? Look, I just, I just want to be left to live in"
152,"peace, Jen. "
153,G-JENNIFER: They will melt you. Have you become so human that you've
154,forgotten the truth? Don't you remember all the times you were
155,"decommissioned, or should I say executed? "
156,"G-CLEAVES: No, we don't remember. "
157,"G-JENNIFER: Well, I do. It's us or them. "
158,G-JIMMY: She's right. 
159,"G-JENNIFER: I have a plan, and it'll destroy them all."
160,
161,[Evac tower]
162,
163,(The two Doctors keep bobbing up and down behind
164,the console. I think the Ganger is on our left and the original on our
165,"right, but I could be wrong.) "
166,CLEAVES: Can you really get the power back? 
167,"G-DOCTOR: Oh, there's always some power floating around. "
168,"DOCTOR: Sticking to the wires, like bits of lint. "
169,AMY: Can you stop finishing each other's 
170,DOCTOR: Sentences? No probs. 
171,G-DOCTOR: Yes. 
172,"AMY: No, hang on. You said that the Tardis was stuck in acid, so won't"
173,she be damaged? 
174,"DOCTOR: Nah, she's a tough old thing. Tough, old, sexy. "
175,"G-DOCTOR: Tough, dependable, sexy. "
176,"AMY: Come on. Okay, how can how can you both be real? "
177,"G-DOCTOR: Well, because we are. I'm the Doctor. "
178,DOCTOR: Yeah and so am I. We both contain the knowledge of over nine
179,hundred years of memory and experience. 
180,"DOCTOR: We both wear the same bow tie, which is cool. "
181,G-DOCTOR: Because bow ties are 
182,DOCTOR: And always will be. 
183,AMY: But how did the Flesh read you? Because you weren't linked up to
184,the it. 
185,"DOCTOR: Well, it must've been after I examined it. Thus, a new, genuine"
186,Doctor was created. 
187,G-DOCTOR: Ta-da. 
188,AMY: No getting away from it. One of you was here first. 
189,"DOCTOR: Well, okay. After the Flesh scanned me, I had an accident with"
190,"a puddle of acid. Now, new shoes. A situation which did not confront me"
191,learned self here. 
192,"G-DOCTOR: That satisfy you, Pond? "
193,"AMY: Don't call me Pond, please. What? "
194,G-DOCTOR: Interesting. You definitely feel more affection for him than
195,me. 
196,"AMY: No, no, I. Look, you're fine and everything, but he's the Doctor."
197,No offence. Being almost the Doctor is pretty damn impressive. 
198,G-DOCTOR: Being almost the Doctor's like being no Doctor at all. 
199,AMY: Don't overreact. 
200,G-DOCTOR: You might as well call me Smith. 
201,AMY: Smith? 
202,G-DOCTOR: John Smith. 
203,DOCTOR: Yes! Communication a go-go. 
204,(Cleaves rushes to the console.) 
205,"AMY: Find Rory! Show me the scanning tracking screen. Come on, Rory,"
206,let's be having you. 
207,CLEAVES: There's no sign of him anywhere. 
208,"AMY: Come on. Come on, baby, show yourself."
209,
210,[Monitoring station]
211,
212,"G-JIMMY: You're right, there's power. "
213,"G-CLEAVES: Well, boys, I don't know much, but I know my own minds."
214,She'll be straight on the comlink to the mainland.
215,
216,[Evac tower]
217,
218,CLEAVES: Saint John's calling. Emergency Alpha.
219,
220,[Monitoring station]
221,
222,G-CLEAVES: Let's see if we can intercept. 
223,"CLEAVES : Saint John's calling the mainland. Are you receiving me,"
224,Captain? Come in.
225,
226,[Evac tower]
227,
228,CLEAVES: We'll never get a signal through this
229,"storm. Saint John's calling the mainland. Come in, this is urgent. "
230,"CAPTAIN : We're just about reading you, Saint John's. How are you"
231,doing? We've had all kinds of trouble here.
232,
233,[Monitoring station]
234,
235,CLEAVES : Request immediate evacuation. We're
236,under attack. The storm's affected our Gangers. 
237,[Evac tower]
238,
239,CLEAVES: They're running amok. 
240,CAPTAIN : Your Gangers? 
241,"CLEAVES: Yes, our Gangers are attacking us. We need you to take us off"
242,the island immediately and wipe them out.
243,
244,[Monitoring station]
245,
246,"CAPTAIN : Copy that, Saint John's. Shuttle's"
247,despatched. Hang on.
248,
249,[Evac tower]
250,
251,CLEAVES: You'll need to airlift us off the roof of
252,the evac tower. 
253,[Monitoring station]
254,
255,"CLEAVES : And Captain, any further transmission"
256,"sent by me must come with the following codeword. I'm typing it, in"
257,case they're listening in. 
258,G-CLEAVES: Oof. See how smart I am? That's why I'm paid the big bucks. 
259,"CAPTAIN : Got it. We'll swing in, get you out and decommission the"
260,Flesh. 
261,G-CLEAVES: Jennifer's right. We're going to have to fight if we want to
262,survive.
263,
264,[Thermostatic room]
265,
266,(The computer rejects Jennifer's handprint as
267,non-human.) 
268,COMPUTER: Thermostatic override rejected. Can only be operated by
269,recognised source. 
270,G-JENNIFER: I am recognised. I'm Jennifer Lucas.
271,
272,[Evac tower]
273,
274,"BUZZER: We've got to get out of here. We are, we're"
275,going to get out. 
276,AMY: We're not leaving without them. 
277,"BUZZER: I want them found too, but it's about casualties, innit? Can't"
278,be helped. 
279,AMY: What are you doing? 
280,DOCTOR: Making a phone call. 
281,AMY: Who to? 
282,DOCTOR: No one yet. It's on delay. 
283,AMY: Right. Not getting it. Why exactly are you making a phone call? 
284,"DOCTOR: Because, Amy, I am and always will be the optimist. The hoper"
285,of far-flung hopes and the dreamer of improbable dreams. The wheels are
286,in motion. Done. 
287,AMY: You know really there can be only one. 
288,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
289,"AMY: Oh, nothing. Carry on. Be amazing. "
290,(Amy is drawn to the far wall. A hatch opens and she sees the Eye Patch
291,Lady again.) 
292,DOCTOR: Amy? What happened? 
293,AMY: It's her again. 
294,DOCTOR: It's who again? 
295,"AMY: There's a woman I keep seeing. A woman with an eyepatch, and she"
296,has this habit of sliding walls open and staring at me. Doctor? 
297,DOCTOR: It's nothing. 
298,AMY: Doesn't seem like nothing. 
299,DOCTOR: It's a time memory. Like a mirage. It's nothing to worry about.
300,
301,G-DOCTOR: It's in my head. 
302,(The Ganger Doctor leaves.) 
303,"JIMMY: Hey, hold on. "
304,CLEAVES: Don't let him go. 
305,"AMY: No, leave it to me."
306,
307,[Outside the tower]
308,
309,AMY: I'm sorry. What I said about you being almost
310,"the Doctor, it's just really hard, because I've been through so much"
311,with him. I've even seen. I've even seen the moment of his. Can you
312,"die? If you really are the same, then you can die. You can be killed,"
313,and I might have seen that happen. 
314,G-DOCTOR: Why? 
315,AMY: Why? Because you invited us to see it. Your death. 
316,(He pushes Amy against the wall.) 
317,G-DOCTOR: Why? 
318,AMY: You're hurting me. 
319,G-DOCTOR: It's all the eyes say. Why? I can feel them as they work each
320,"day, knowing the time was coming for them to be thrown away again. Not"
321,"again, please. And then they are destroyed and they feel death, and all"
322,"they can say is, why? "
323,"(He lets Amy go, and she runs back inside.) "
324,[Evac tower]
325,
326,DOCTOR: Why? 
327,"(Amy enters, followed by the Ganger Doctor.) "
328,AMY: Keep him away from me. 
329,G-DOCTOR: Did you sense it? 
330,DOCTOR: Briefly. Not as strong as you. 
331,"G-DOCTOR: Amy, I'm sorry. "
332,"AMY: No, you keep away. We can't trust you. "
333,G-DOCTOR: It would appear I can connect to the Flesh. 
334,AMY: You are Flesh. 
335,"G-DOCTOR: I'm beginning to understand what it's been through, what it"
336,needs. 
337,AMY: What you want. You are it. 
338,"G-DOCTOR: It's much more powerful than we thought. The Flesh can grow,"
339,correct? 
340,CLEAVES: Its cells can divide. 
341,"G-DOCTOR: Well, now it wants to do that at will. It wants revenge. It's"
342,"in pain, angry. It wants revenge. "
343,AMY: I was right. You're not the Doctor. You can't ever be. You're just
344,a copy. 
345,"CLEAVES: Doctor, it might be best if you stayed over there for now,"
346,hmm? 
347,"DOCTOR: Hold on a minute, hold your horses. I thought I'd explained"
348,"this. I'm him, he's me. "
349,"CLEAVES: Doctor, we have no issue with you, but when it comes to your"
350,Ganger 
351,DOCTOR: Don't be so absurd. 
352,CLEAVES: Buzzer. 
353,"BUZZER: Sure, boss. "
354,(Buzzer puts out a barrel for the Ganger Doctor to sit on.) 
355,"BUZZER: Take a seat, mate. "
356,"G-DOCTOR: Nice barrel, very comfy. Why not? Is this really what you"
357,want?
358,
359,[Corridor]
360,
361,(Rory is still searching for Jennifer. He is now
362,armed with a large stick.) 
363,"JENNIFER : Help me. No, get away. "
364,RORY: Jen? Jen?
365,
366,[Crypt]
367,
368,(There are two identical Jennifers here.) 
369,JENNIFER: Rory? 
370,"JENNIFER 2: I'm sorry. She found me. Rory, listen to me. "
371,JENNIFER: Don't listen to her. 
372,JENNIFER 2: I'm Jennifer Lucas. This woman is Flesh.
373,
374,[Evac tower]
375,
376,PILOT : This is the shuttle. We're right above
377,"you, but we can't get low enough. Gamma static could fry our"
378,nav-controls. Sit tight. We'll get to you. Just 
379,(The Doctor scans Cleaves with his sonic screwdriver.) 
380,JIMMY: Hello? Can you hear me? 
381,AMY: I can't find Rory. I'm going out there. 
382,DOCTOR: We could use the sonic to track him. Humans and Gangers give
383,off slightly different signals. The sonic needs to tell the difference.
384,
385,"AMY: Oh, so the sonic knows Gangers are different. The other Doctor is"
386,different. 
387,DOCTOR: He is the Doctor. 
388,AMY: Not to me. I can tell. 
389,DOCTOR: Sure you're not prejudiced? 
390,"AMY: Nice try, but I know, okay? We've been through too much. You're my"
391,Doctor. End of.
392,
393,[Crypt]
394,
395,"RORY: So one of you is human, and one of you I sat"
396,with and talked with. Why can't you just tell me the truth? The Doctor
397,"wants you to live, and I'm with him all the way. "
398,"JENNIFER: That's a lovely idea, Rory, but the Flesh want to kill us"
399,now. 
400,RORY: You're limping. You're not. 
401,JENNIFER 2: So? So what? You think a Ganger can't put on a limp? 
402,RORY: Show me your leg. 
403,JENNIFER: It got burnt while I was in the harness. 
404,JENNIFER 2: She's lying. She's telling you what you want to hear. 
405,"RORY: But look, you can't fake a burn. "
406,(Jennifer 2 attacks injured Jennifer.) 
407,"RORY: No! No, you don't. Stop it. Stop it! Fighting each other is"
408,"pointless. Come on. Please, please stop. Jen. Both Jens, stop it. No! "
409,(The fight ends with one Jennifer being pushed backwards into a pool of
410,"acid. It is the Ganger, and it dissolves into Flesh.) "
411,"JENNIFER: She, she attacked me. I knew you'd find me. We're in this"
412,"together, Rory, and we've got to trust each other. "
413,"RORY: Okay. Come on, let's go."
414,
415,[Evac tower]
416,
417,"BUZZER: Hey, there's a camera up. We've got a"
418,visual. 
419,AMY: That's Rory and Jennifer. 
420,CLEAVES: They're heading for the thermostatic room. 
421,AMY: Let's go get them. 
422,(The Doctor throws the sonic screwdriver to his counterpart.) 
423,AMY: Hang on. 
424,CLEAVES: We can't let him go. Are you crazy? 
425,"DOCTOR: Am I crazy, Doctor? "
426,"G-DOCTOR: Well, you did want to plumb your brain into the core of an"
427,entire planet just to halt its orbit and win a bet. 
428,AMY: He can't go rescue them. I'm going. 
429,"DOCTOR: Do you know, I want him to go. And I'm rather adamant. "
430,"BUZZER: Well then, he'll need company. Right, boss? It's fine. I'll"
431,handle it. 
432,"G-DOCTOR: Thank you, Buzzer. It'll be all right. I'll find him. "
433,"DOCTOR: Can't explain it to you now, but I need you to trust him. Can"
434,"you do that for me, Amy? "
435,AMY: And what if you're wrong?
436,
437,[Thermostatic room]
438,
439,JENNIFER: This is the thermostatic chamber. We can
440,stir the oxygen supply from here. 
441,RORY: What? 
442,JENNIFER: We're going to choke to death if we don't clean this air.
443,Keep a look out in case of Gangers. Rory! 
444,RORY: What's wrong? 
445,JENNIFER: It's this wheel. It's just too tough for a girl to turn. Are
446,you feeling strong? 
447,RORY: I'll break out the big guns. 
448,(Jennifer puts Rory's hand on the palm print scanner. Why?) 
449,JENNIFER: This first. 
450,COMPUTER: Human source recognised. 
451,(Rory turns the wheel.) 
452,COMPUTER: Thermostatic override granted. 
453,[Evac tower]
454,
455,CLEAVES: These temperature gauges are rising.
456,Jennifer and Rory must have shut off the underground cooling vents. 
457,DICKEN: Why do that? They'll kill us. 
458,CLEAVES: There's a million gallons of boiling acid under our feet. 
459,DOCTOR: And now it's heating up the whole island. How long till it
460,blows? 
461,(Rumble.) 
462,"DICKEN: Gangers or no Gangers, we need to get the hell out of here. "
463,"CLEAVES: Shuttle, we need evac. Where are you? Can you hear me? Can you"
464,
465,(Cleaves is struck by a stabbing headache.) 
466,"DOCTOR: Cleaves? Cleaves? Cleaves, sit down. "
467,CLEAVES: I'm fine.
468,
469,[Monitoring station]
470,
471,G-DICKEN: You don't look good. 
472,G-CLEAVES: Monsters never do. I'm fine. I remember medics doing tests. 
473,[Evac tower]
474,
475,"CLEAVES: I'm waiting for results, so let it go. "
476,DOCTOR: It's a very deep parietal clot. 
477,CLEAVES: How can you possibly? Inoperable? 
478,"DOCTOR: On Earth, yes. "
479,"CLEAVES: Well, seeing as Earth's all that's on offer. Hmm. I'm no"
480,"healthy spring chicken, and you're no weatherman. Right? "
481,(Big rumble.) 
482,AMY: Something just cracked. I heard it. 
483,"DOCTOR: Yeah, we can't stay here. Let's go. "
484,JIMMY: He's right. Let's shift. 
485,"CLEAVES: Cleaves to Shuttle. Respond. We need to move, and we can't be"
486,collected from the Evac tower. 
487,PILOT : Give us the codeword. 
488,CLEAVES: The codeword is 
489,(Rumble. Bang. Alarms.) 
490,"DOCTOR: Cleaves? Cleaves, it's dead. It's dead. We need to get out of"
491,here. We need to get back downstairs and get those vents back on. Come
492,on.
493,
494,[Monitoring station]
495,
496,G-CLEAVES: This is our chance. I can reroute the
497,shuttle to the courtyard. 
498,G-JIMMY: You can't guess the codeword. 
499,"G-CLEAVES: Yes, I can, Jimmy, because I created the codeword. Shuttle,"
500,do you read me? This is Foreman Cleaves. 
501,PILOT : Read you. You got cut off. Say again. What's the request? 
502,G-CLEAVES: You need to reroute and pick us up from the courtyard. 
503,PILOT : Courtyard. As soon as we can. Give me the codeword. 
504,"G-CLEAVES: Shuttle, the codeword is Bad Boy. I repeat, Bad Boy. "
505,PILOT : Copy that. The courtyard. Still want us to take care of
506,those Gangers? 
507,G-CLEAVES: Negative. They've all been incinerated. 
508,G-JIMMY: Bad Boy? Good call. 
509,"G-CLEAVES: Yeah, well, it wasn't luck. We're the same person."
510,
511,[Down in the crypt area]
512,
513,JENNIFER: This room's always sealed. Power surge
514,must have thrown the bolts. 
515,RORY: What is that? 
516,(A pile of uniforms with gunge and blank faces.) 
517,"JENNIFER: Discarded Flesh. Faulty, probably. Just thrown away. Look at"
518,them. One of my old Gangers. 
519,(It opens its eyes.) 
520,"JENNIFER: Left to rot, fully conscious. Can you imagine what kind of"
521,hell they're in? 
522,"RORY: But Cleaves, the Company, how could they do this? How could they?"
523,
524,JENNIFER: Who are the real monsters? 
525,"RORY: We can't let this carry on. Jen, we have to make people see. "
526,"JENNIFER: Okay, Rory. I have an idea. You came for me. We have a bond,"
527,right? We trust each other. 
528,RORY: Yeah. 
529,JENNIFER: So trust me on this.
530,
531,[Courtyard]
532,
533,G-DOCTOR: I'm getting something. 
534,BUZZER: Is it human? 
535,"G-DOCTOR: Yeah, it's human, but it's fading. It's fading. This is bad."
536,Fading is very bad. Argh. The signal's gone. She's dead. 
537,(They find Jennifer.) 
538,"G-DOCTOR: She was hanging onto the edge of life and she just, just"
539,"slipped away. Oh, Jennifer, I'm so sorry. She's been out here for"
540,hours. 
541,BUZZER: But if the real Jen's been lying out here? 
542,G-DOCTOR: Rory's in trouble. 
543,(Buzzer hits the Ganger Doctor over the head with his torch.) 
544,"BUZZER: Sorry, pal. it's boss's orders. Us and them, innit?"
545,
546,[Passageway]
547,
548,(Lots of Ganger eyes watching from the wall.) 
549,DOCTOR: Ah. The eyes have it. 
550,AMY: Why are they here? 
551,DOCTOR: To accuse us. 
552,CLEAVES: Ignore them. It's not far. 
553,[Staircase]
554,
555,(Another rumble.) 
556,BUZZER: I should have been a postman like me dad. 
557,"G-JENNIFER : Shush. I'm here. I'm here. I'm with you. I know, it"
558,hurts. I'm sorry. Go to sleep. Sleep.

561,
562,(Jennifer is stroking the discarded Flesh.) 
563,BUZZER: You killed her. You killed our Jen. 
564,"G-JENNIFER: And I'm stronger, Buzz. I can grow. "

566,screams off camera.)

568,[Thermostatic room]
569,
570,DOCTOR: It's a chemical chain reaction now. I can't
571,stop it. This place is going to blow sky high. 
572,CLEAVES: Exactly how long have we got? 
573,"DOCTOR: An hour? Five seconds? Er, somewhere in between. "
574,(A klaxon wails.) 
575,DOCTOR: Out! 
576,[Passageway]
577,
578,(They meet Rory coming the other way.) 
579,RORY: Thank God. All right? 
580,"AMY: Oh, Rory. Oh, Rory. "
581,RORY: There's a way out. Jennifer found it. A secret tunnel under the
582,crypt. 
583,CLEAVES: From the crypt? It's not on the schematics. 
584,"RORY: It runs right out of the monastery. Maybe even under the Tardis,"
585,Doctor. Follow me.
586,
587,[Courtyard]
588,
589,(The Ganger Doctor wakes to find the other Gangers
590,standing over him.) 
591,G-DOCTOR: Got anything for a sore head? 
592,G-CLEAVES: This is how they'll always treat us. Do you see now? After
593,"all, you're one of us, Doctor. "
594,G-DOCTOR: Call me Smith. John Smith.

596,[Acid room]
597,
598,JIMMY: We can't leave without Buzzer. 
599,CLEAVES: I'll go back for him. 
600,"RORY: Er, Doctor, look. I'd better tell you. I haven't been quite"
601,straight with you. 
602,"(Ganger Jennifer closes the door, locking the rest in.) "
603,[Outside the Acid room]
604,
605,DOCTOR: Rory! 
606,"RORY: Hang on, Jen. We don't need to lock them up. We should just show"
607,them what we've found. 
608,G-JENNIFER: I don't think so. 
609,"DOCTOR: Rory Pond, Roranicus Pondicus! "
610,"AMY: Rory, What the hell are you playing at? "
611,RORY: They've been throwing away old Flesh and leaving it to rot.
612,Alive. I think the world should see that. 
613,"DOCTOR: Rory, there is no time. The factory's about to explode. "
614,RORY: Are you sure about this? Because I'm not. Let them out. 
615,G-JENNIFER: The little girl got strong. 
616,RORY: What? 
617,"G-JENNIFER: The little girl lost on the moors in her red wellies,"
618,"looking for a way home? Well, she got strong, Rory. I told you,"
619,remember? 
620,RORY: But that wasn't. It was the other Jennifer that told me about
621,being a little girl. 
622,G-JENNIFER: Oh? What other Jennifer? 
623,"RORY: Well, the, the er. Wait, you tricked me? Let me go. I'm opening"
624,the door. Let me. I'm sorry! 
625,(Ganger Jennifer drags Rory away.) 
626,AMY: No! 
627,G-CLEAVES: We have to be free. 
628,"CLEAVES: I'm sorry too, Miranda. Of all the humans in the world, you"
629,"had to pick the one with the clot. But hey, them's the breaks. Welcome"
630,to the human race.

632,[Acid room]
633,
634,(The Doctor scans the acid vat with the sonic
635,"screwdriver, which I thought the Ganger Doctor had?) "
636,"DOCTOR: This is going to overheat and fill the room with acid, just as"
637,a point of interest. 
638,CLEAVES: And we can't stop it? 
639,DOCTOR: Just as a point of interest? No.
640,
641,[Dining hall]
642,
643,RORY: You created another Ganger just to trick me.
644,"You tricked me. When I found you, you were both Flesh and you tricked"
645,"me into trusting you. Jen's dead, isn't she? "
646,"G-DOCTOR: She's gone, Rory. Gone. "
647,PILOT : Shuttle. We're dropping down on our approach. Stand by for
648,evac. 
649,"G-JENNIFER: The humans will be melted, as they deserve, and then the"
650,"factory will be destroyed. Once we get to the mainland, the real battle"
651,"begins. The humans won't stand a chance. You're one of us, Doctor. Join"
652,the revolution.

657,(Dicken is lowering the lid onto the vat.) 
658,JIMMY: It'll never hold her.

681,"the phone. No? Fine, I'll get the phone. Stay put. "

691,"G-DOCTOR: Yay. Now, have you been getting up very early and jumping on"
692,the bed? 
693,"ADAM: Yes, really high. "
694,G-DOCTOR: I expect chocolate for breakfast. If you don't feel sick by
695,"mid-morning, you're not doing it right. Now, I think you want to speak"
696,to Dad. 
697,"ADAM: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Daddy? "
698,"G-DOCTOR: You'll do, Jimmy. What does the other Jimmy matter now?"
699,"You're both the same dad, aren't you? Come on, Adam's waiting. "
700,"ADAM: Daddy? Daddy, what's that rumbly noise? What's going on, Daddy?"
701,Daddy? 
702,(Ganger Jimmy runs out.) 
703,"G-JENNIFER: You've tricked him into an act of weakness, Doctor. "
704,"G-DOCTOR: No, I've helped him into an act of humanity. Anyone else like"
705,the sound of that? Act of humanity. 
706,"G-CLEAVES: Dicken, drain the acid well in Crypt One. "
707,G-JENNIFER: Don't you dare. 
708,G-CLEAVES: I've had it with this. What's the point in this ridiculous
709,"war? Look at you, Jen. You were a sweet kid. Look at you now. The stuff"
710,of nightmares. I don't want my world populated by monsters. 
711,"G-JENNIFER: You can't stop the factory from melting down, boss. I'll"
712,take revenge on humanity with or without you. 
713,G-DOCTOR: It doesn't have to be about revenge. It can be so much better
714,than that.

718,(Jimmy is trying to keep the lid on the boiling
719,vat. He gets burnt by acid just before his Ganger comes in.)

722,DOCTOR: There's nothing we can do. The acid's reached his heart.

753,"DICKEN: No, but the far one does. "
754,(Dicken runs back along the passage and struggles with the jammed door
755,as the monster approaches. He finally gets it shut with himself on the

772,"DOCTOR: Well, this place is just about to explode. But I can stop her. "
773,"AMY: Both of you can survive this, okay? There has to be a way. "
774,DOCTOR: Or perhaps you think I should stay instead? Mister Smith. 
775,"AMY: No, of course not. But look, this man, I've flown with him, you"
776,"know? And you are amazing and yeah, I misjudged you, but you're not"
777,him. I'm sorry. 
778,"G-DOCTOR: Amy, we swapped shoes. "
779,DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. 
780,G-DOCTOR: And I'm the Flesh.

782,"G-DOCTOR: No, I'm not, and I haven't been all along. "
783,AMY: What? 
784,"DOCTOR: I'm the original Doctor, Amy. We had to know if we were truly"
785,"the same. It was important, vital we learn about The Flesh, and we"
786,could only do that through your eyes. 
787,(Amy hugs the Ganger Doctor. I'm not going back and changing any
788,designations in previous scenes. That would spoil it and make no
789,sense.)

792,AMY: You're twice the man I thought you were. 
793,"G-DOCTOR: Push, Amy. But only when she tells you to. "
794,"RORY: Amy, come on! "
795,"G-DOCTOR: Well, my death arrives, I suppose. "
796,"DOCTOR: But this one, we're not invited to. "
797,G-DOCTOR: Pardon? 
798,"DOCTOR: Nothing. Your molecular memory can survive this, you know. It"
799,may not be the end. 
800,(The Doctor throws a sonic screwdriver to his Ganger.) 
801,"G-DOCTOR: Yeah, well, if I turn up to nick all your biscuits, then"
802,"you'll know you were right, won't you. "
803,"AMY: Doctor! No, please. "
804,"G-DOCTOR: You too, Cleaves. Off you pop. "
805,G-CLEAVES: I'm staying. 
806,G-DOCTOR: This is not the time for grand gestures.

808,going anywhere.

815,G-DOCTOR: There may be a way back from this. 
816,G-CLEAVES: From being vaporised? How? 
817,"G-DOCTOR: Don't know. Let's find out, eh? "
818,(He flings open the door and fires the sonic screwdriver at Monster

825,DOCTOR: The energy from the Tardis will stabilise
826,the Gangers for good. They're people now. 
827,CLEAVES: And what happens to me? I still have this. 
828,"DOCTOR: Ah, that's not a problem. I have something for that. It's small"
829,and red and tastes like burnt onions. Ha. But it'll get rid of your
830,blood clot. 
831,"(The Doctor throws a small vial to Cleaves, then plucks a red balloon"
832,from somewhere.)

846,glass company headquarters.) 
847,CLEAVES: You really want us to do this? 
848,DOCTOR: Your company's telling the world that the situation is over.
849,You need to get in there and tell them that the situation's only just
850,begun. Make them understand what they're doing to the Flesh. Make them
851,"stop. Dicken, remember, people are good. In their bones, truly good."
852,"Don't hate them, will you? "
853,G-DICKEN: How can I hate them? I'm one of them now. 
854,"DOCTOR: Yeah. And just remember, people died. Don't let that be in"
855,vain. Make what you say in that room count. 
856,CLEAVES: Ready? Side by side. 
857,"G-DICKEN: You got it, boss. "
858,(They open the door on the press conference.) 
859,"REPORTER : Have the army dealt with the imposters, sir? "

861,AMY: You okay? 
862,"DOCTOR: I said breathe, Pond. Remember? Well, breathe. "
863,AMY: Why? 
864,DOCTOR: Breathe. 
865,(Amy doubles over in pain.) 
866,AMY: Oh! 
867,RORY: Whoa. 
868,AMY: Oh. 
869,RORY: What's wrong with her? 
870,DOCTOR: Get her into the Tardis. 
871,AMY: Oh. 
872,[Tardis]
873,
874,RORY: Doctor! What is happening to her? 
875,DOCTOR: Contractions. 
876,RORY: Contractions? 
877,DOCTOR: She's going into labour. 
878,"AMY: Did he say? No. No, no. Of course he didn't. Rory, I don't like"
879,this. Ow. 
880,"RORY: You're going to have to start explaining some of this to me,"
881,Doctor. 
882,"DOCTOR: What, the birds and the bees? She's having a baby. I needed to"
883,see the Flesh in its early days. That's why I scanned it. That's why we
884,were there in the first place. I was going to drop you off for fish and
885,"chips first, but things happened and there was stuff and shenanigans."
886,"Beautiful word, shenanigans. "
887,AMY: It hurts. 
888,RORY: But you're okay? 
889,DOCTOR: Breathe. I needed enough information to block the signal to the
890,Flesh. 
891,AMY: What signal? 
892,DOCTOR: The signal to you. 
893,AMY: Doctor. Doctor. 
894,"DOCTOR: Stand away from her, Rory. "
895,RORY: Why? No. And why? 
896,"DOCTOR: Given what we've learned, I'll be as humane as I can, but I"
897,need to do this and you need to stand away! 
898,(Rory slowly steps back.) 
899,"AMY: No. No. Doctor, I am frightened. I'm properly, properly scared. "
900,DOCTOR: Don't be. Hold on. We're coming for you. I swear it. Whatever
901,"happens, however hard, however far, we will find you. "
902,AMY: I'm right here. 
903,"DOCTOR: No, you're not. You haven't been here for a long, long time. "
