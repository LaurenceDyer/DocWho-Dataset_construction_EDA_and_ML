21, (The Tardis materialises in a small park across
22,the road from groups of terraced houses.) 
23,"DOCTOR: No, Amy, it's definitely not the fifth moon of Cindie Colesta."
24,I think I can see a Ryman's. 
25,"(There is an explosion, throwing the Doctor to the ground, and the"
26,Tardis dematerialises.) 
27,DOCTOR: Amy! Amy!
28,
29,[Tardis]
30,
31,"(The Tardis is shaking, and there is a shower of"
32,sparks nearby.) 
33,"AMY: Doctor? It's saying we're on Earth. Essex, Colchester. "
34,(The shaking stops.) 
35,"AMY: Doctor? It's taking off again. Doctor, can you hear me?"
36,
37,[Aickman Road]
38,
39,DOCTOR: Amy! Amy. 
40,"(One day later, a young man is strolling past one of the terraces of"
41,houses when he hears a voice.) 
42,"MAN : Hello? Hello, please? Hello? I need your help. There's been"
43,"an accident. Please, help me. "
44,"(The young man goes up to the door, which has a cat flap in it. The"
45,"voice is coming from the intercom for the two flats, 79a and 79b. The"
46,door is electronically opened.)
47,
48,[House]
49,
50,(The upstairs lights are flickering.) 
51,STEVEN: Hello? 
52,"MAN : Please, will you help me? "
53,STEVEN: Help you? What's wrong? 
54,(A figure is standing at the top of the stairs.) 
55,MAN: Something terrible's happened. Please help me. 
56,(Steven goes up the stairs and into the flat to the sound of spooky
57,music. This
58,"door is exactly like the front door, complete with cat flap.)"
59,
60,[Flat]
61,
62,"(Downstairs, in 79b.) "
63,"SOPHIE: Craig, what's that on the ceiling? "
64,CRAIG: What's what on the ceiling? 
65,SOPHIE: That. It's coming from upstairs. 
66,(A damp stain in the corner.) 
67,SOPHIE: Who lives up there again? 
68,CRAIG: Just some bloke. 
69,(The stain spreads.) 
70,"CRAIG: So what's the plan tonight? Pizza, booze, telly? "
71,"SOPHIE: Yeah, pizza, booze, telly. "
72,(Bang! upstairs.) 
73,SOPHIE: What is he doing up there? You put the advert up yet? 
74,"CRAIG: Yeah, did it today, paper shop window. One furnished room"
75,"available immediately, shared kitchen, bathroom, with twenty seven year"
76,"old male, non-smoker, four hundred pound pcm, per calendar month, suit"
77,young professional. 
78,"SOPHIE: Mmm, sounds ideal. That's your mission in life, Craig. Find me"
79,a man. 
80,"CRAIG: Yeah, otherwise you'll have to settle for me. "
81,SOPHIE: You'll have to settle for me first. 
82,(Sophie answers her phone.) 
83,"SOPHIE: Oh, Melina again. What? Right. Yeah, but I've kind of got"
84,"plans. No, it's nothing important, it's just Craig. "
85,(Craig sees the stain spreading again.) 
86,"CRAIG: Oh, thanks, Soph. "
87,"SOPHIE: Sorry. You know what I mean. Okay, I'll talk to Craig. Okay."
88,Now she's having a Dylan crisis on top of the Clare crisis. It could be
89,"another all-nighter. I'm sorry, but I really should go. Do you mind if"
90,I go? 
91,"CRAIG: No, not at all. No, honestly. Course not. Go. "
92,SOPHIE: Because I could stay. 
93,"CRAIG: No, go on. "
94,"SOPHIE: I mean, we've got plans. "
95,CRAIG: Just pizza. 
96,"SOPHIE: Yeah, it's just pizza. Okay, right, I'm going. "
97,"CRAIG: All right, then. Well, er, I'll see you soon. "
98,SOPHIE: Yeah. 
99,"CRAIG: All right. And give me a call, and I hope everything's okay. "
100,"SOPHIE: Thanks, sorry. "
101,"(Sophie leaves the flat and hears noises from upstairs, then footsteps."
102,She leaves the house.) 
103,"CRAIG: Just tell her. Just tell her. I love you. I love you. Oh, just."
104,"Hey, I don't know if you knew. Oh. "
105,(The doorbell rings.) 
106,CRAIG: Every time. 
107,"(Sophie has left her keys behind on a fluffy pink key ring, so he picks"
108,them up and goes to the front door.) 
109,CRAIG: I love you. I love you. 
110,[Front door]
111,
112,CRAIG: I love you. I love you. 
113,(He opens the door.) 
114,CRAIG: I love you. 
115,"DOCTOR: Well, that's good, because I'm your new lodger. Do you know,"
116,this is going to be easier than I expected. 
117,(The Doctor takes the fluffy pink keys from Craig. There is a Bluetooth
118,device in his ear.) 
119,CRAIG: But I only put the advert up today. I didn't put my address. 
120,"DOCTOR: Well, aren't you lucky I came along? More lucky than you know."
121,"Less of a young professional, more of an ancient amateur, but frankly"
122,I'm an absolute dream. 
123,"CRAIG: Hang on a minute, mate. I don't know if I want you staying. And"
124,give me back those keys. You can't have those. 
125,"DOCTOR: Yes, quite right. Have some rent. "
126,(The Doctor hands Craig a paper take-away bag with lots of twenty pound
127,notes in it.) 
128,"DOCTOR: That's probably quite a lot, isn't it? Looks like a lot. Is it"
129,a lot? I can never tell. 
130,(They go into the hallway. The lights upstairs are flickering.) 
131,"DOCTOR: Don't spend it all on sweets, unless you like sweets. I like"
132,sweets. Ooo. 
133,(The Doctor gives Craig a couple of air kisses about six inches from
134,each cheek.) 
135,"DOCTOR: That's how we greet each other nowadays, isn't it? I'm the"
136,"Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the"
137,"Doctor, too. Still don't know why. "
138,CRAIG: Craig Owens. The Doctor? 
139,DOCTOR: Yep. Who lives upstairs? 
140,CRAIG: Just some bloke. 
141,DOCTOR: What's he look like? 
142,CRAIG: Normal. He's very quiet. 
143,(Crash.) 
144,"CRAIG: Usually. Sorry, who are you again? Hello? "
145,[Flat]
146,
147,CRAIG: Excuse me? 
148,DOCTOR: Ah. I suppose that's dry rot? 
149,CRAIG: Or damp. Or mildew. 
150,DOCTOR: Or none of the above. 
151,CRAIG: I'll get someone to fix it. 
152,"DOCTOR: No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the"
153,"Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor, don't call me the Rotmeister. This is"
154,the most beautiful parlour I have ever seen. You're obviously a man of
155,"impeccable taste. I can stay, Craig, can't I? Say I can. "
156,CRAIG: You haven't even seen the room. 
157,DOCTOR: The room? 
158,CRAIG: Your room. 
159,"DOCTOR: My room? Oh, yes. My room. My room. Take me to my room. "
160,[Doctor's room]
161,
162,(Eighties decor.) 
163,"CRAIG: Yeah, this is Mark's old room. He owns the place. Moved out"
164,about a month ago. This uncle he'd never even heard of died and left a
165,load of money in the will. 
166,DOCTOR: How very convenient. This'll do just right. In fact. 
167,(Another loud crash from above. The Doctor tests the air with a damp
168,finger.) 
169,DOCTOR: No time to lose. I'll take it. Ah you'll want to see my
170,credentials. There. 
171,(The psychic paper gets passed behind the Doctor's back and shown to
172,Craig three times.) 
173,DOCTOR: National Insurance number. NHS number. References. 
174,CRAIG: Is that a reference from the Archbishop of Canterbury? 
175,DOCTOR: I'm his special favourite. Are you hungry? I'm hungry. 
176,CRAIG: I haven't got anything in.
177,
178,[Flat]
179,
180,DOCTOR: You've got everything I need for an
181,"omelette fines herbes, pour deux. So, who's the girl on the fridge? "
182,"(A photograph of Craig and Sophie, along with the Vincent van Gogh"
183,Self-portrait in Straw Hat postcard.) 
184,CRAIG: My friend. Sophie. 
185,DOCTOR: Girlfriend? 
186,CRAIG: A friend who is a girl. There's nothing going on. 
187,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's completely normal. Works for me. "
188,"CRAIG: We met at work about a year ago, at the call centre. "
189,"DOCTOR: Oh really, a communications exchange? That could be handy. "
190,CRAIG: Firm's going down though. The bosses are using a totally rubbish
191,business model. I know what they should do. I got a plan all worked
192,"out. But I'm just a phone drone, I can't go running in saying I know"
193,best. Why am I telling you this? I don't even know you. 
194,"DOCTOR: Well, I've got one of those faces. People never stop blurting"
195,out their plans while I'm around. 
196,CRAIG: Right. Where's your stuff? 
197,"DOCTOR: Oh, don't worry, it'll materialise. If all goes to plan."
198,
199,[Tardis]
200,
201,(The Tardis is struggling to stay solid.) 
202,"AMY: Come on, which one? Which one? No. Why won't you land? "
203,[Flat]
204,
205,(The omelettes have been demolished.) 
206,"CRAIG: Oh, that was incredible. That was absolutely brilliant. Where"
207,did you learn to cook? 
208,"DOCTOR: Paris, in the eighteenth century. No, hang on, that's not"
209,"recent, is it? Seventeenth? No, no, no. Twentieth. Sorry, I'm not used"
210,to doing them in the right order. 
211,CRAIG: Has anyone ever told you that you're a bit weird? 
212,"DOCTOR: They never really stop. Ever been to Paris, Craig? "
213,CRAIG: Nah. I can't see the point of Paris. I'm not much of a
214,traveller. 
215,DOCTOR: I can tell from your sofa. 
216,CRAIG: My sofa? 
217,DOCTOR: You're starting to look like it. 
218,"CRAIG: Thanks, mate, that's lovely. No, I like it here. I'd miss it,"
219,I'd miss 
220,DOCTOR: Those keys. 
221,CRAIG: What? 
222,DOCTOR: You're sort of fondling them. 
223,CRAIG: I'm holding them. 
224,DOCTOR: Right. 
225,"CRAIG: Anyway. These, these are your keys. "
226,DOCTOR: I can stay? 
227,"CRAIG: Yeah, you're weird and you can cook. It's good enough for me."
228,"Right. Outdoor, front door, your door. "
229,DOCTOR: My door. My place. My gaff. Ha ha! Yes. Me with a key. 
230,"CRAIG: And listen, Mark and I, we had an arrangement where if you ever"
231,"need me out of your hair, just give me a shout, okay? "
232,DOCTOR: Why would I want that? 
233,"CRAIG: In case you want to bring someone round. A girlfriend or, a"
234,boyfriend? 
235,"CRAIG: Oh, I will. I'll shout if that happens. Yes. Something like, I"
236,"was not expecting this! By the way, that. The rot. I've got the"
237,strangest feeling we shouldn't touch it.
238,
239,[Doctor's room]
240,
241,"DOCTOR: Earth to Pond, Earth to Pond. "
242,[Tardis]
243,
244,"DOCTOR : Come in, Pond. "
245,AMY: Doctor! 
246,(Massive feedback through the earpiece.) 
247,AMY: Sorry. 
248,"DOCTOR: Could you not wreck my new earpiece, Pond?"
249,
250,[Craig's room]
251,
252,(Craig is on his phone and looking at the bank
253,notes.) 
254,"CRAIG: No, I mean, he seems a laugh. He's a bit weird. Good weird, you"
255,know? 
256,SOPHIE : And he just happens to have three grand on him in a paper
257,bag? 
258,CRAIG: Yeah. 
259,[Sophie's room]
260,
261,"SOPHIE: Wait, wait. The Doctor? "
262,[Craig's room]
263,
264,"SOPHIE : Craig, what if he's a dealer?"
265,
266,[Aickman Road]
267,
268,(A woman is walking along after a late night at a
269,club.) 
270,"MAN : Hello. Stop, please. Can you hear me? I need your help."
271,
272,[Doctor's room]
273,
274,DOCTOR: How's the Tardis coping?
275,
276,[Tardis]
277,
278,(Amy holds out the hand set.) 
279,AMY: See for yourself. 
280,[Doctor's room]
281,
282,"DOCTOR: Ooo, nasty. She's locked in a"
283,"materialisation loop, trying to land again "
284,[Tardis]
285,
286,DOCTOR : But she can't. 
287,"AMY: Hmm. And whatever's stopping her is upstairs in that flat. So, go"
288,upstairs and sort it.
289,
290,[Aickman Road]
291,
292,MAN : Please. My little girl's hurt. 
293,(The woman goes inside.) 
294,[Doctor's room]
295,
296,DOCTOR: I don't know what it is yet. Anything that
297,can stop the Tardis from landing is big. Scary big.
298,
299,[Tardis]
300,
301,AMY: Wait. Are you scared?
302,
303,[House]
304,
305,(A seemingly younger man is standing at the top of
306,the stairs.) 
307,"MAN : I'm so sorry, but will you help me? Please? "
308,CLUBBER: Help you? 
309,(She goes up the stairs.)
310,
311,[Craig's room]
312,
313,SOPHIE : A bow tie? Are you serious? 
314,DOCTOR : Be fair. Could be even 
315,CRAIG: Hang on a sec.
316,
317,[Sophie's room]
318,
319,SOPHIE: What? Craig. 
320,[Craig's room]
321,
322,SOPHIE : Craig? 
323,(Craig has got out of bed to listen to the Doctor's voice coming
324,through the wall.) 
325,DOCTOR : Orange juice. Neocene Arbuckle. Rare tarantula on the
326,table. Oh.
327,
328,[Doctor's room]
329,
330,DOCTOR: I can't go up there until I know what it is
331,and how to deal with it. And it is vital that this man upstairs doesn't
332,realise who and what I am. So no sonicking. No advanced technology. I
333,can only use this because we're on scramble. To anyone else hearing
334,"this conversation, we're talking absolute gibberish."
335,
336,[Craig's room]
337,
338,DOCTOR : Practical eruption in chicken.
339,Descartes Lombardy spiral.
340,
341,[Doctor's room]
342,
343,DOCTOR: Now all I've got to do is pass as an
344,ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? 
345,AMY : Have you seen you? 
346,DOCTOR: So you're just going to be snide. No helpful hints?
347,
348,[Tardis]
349,
350,"AMY: Hmm. Well, here's one. Bow tie, get rid."
351,
352,[Doctor's room]
353,
354,"DOCTOR: Bow ties are cool. Come on, Amy, I'm a"
355,normal bloke. Tell me what normal blokes do. 
356,"AMY : They watch telly, they play football "
357,[Tardis]
358,
359,AMY: They go down the pub. 
360,[Doctor's room]
361,
362,"DOCTOR: I could do those things. I don't, but I"
363,could. 
364,(Bang upstairs.) 
365,"DOCTOR: Hang on. Wait, wait, wait. Amy? "
366,(The Tardis is going crazy and the hands on the Doctor's alarm clock
367,and wrist watch are going backwards and forwards very rapidly.) 
368,DOCTOR: Interesting. Localised time loop.
369,
370,[Tardis]
371,
372,AMY: Ow. What's all that?
373,
374,[Doctor's room]
375,
376,DOCTOR: Time distortion. Whatever's happening
377,upstairs is still affecting you. 
378,(Lights are flashing in the upstairs flat. The woman is screaming.) 
379,[Tardis]
380,
381,AMY: It's stopped. Ish. 
382,[Doctor's room]
383,
384,AMY : How about your end? 
385,DOCTOR: My end's good. 
386,AMY : So 
387,[Tardis]
388,
389,"AMY: Doesn't sound great, but nothing to worry"
390,about?
391,
392,[Doctor's room]
393,
394,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, not really. Just keep the"
395,zigzag plotter on full. 
396,[Tardis]
397,
398,DOCTOR : That'll protect you. 
399,AMY: Ow. 
400,[Doctor's room]
401,
402,"DOCTOR: Amy, I said the zigzag plotter."
403,
404,[Tardis]
405,
406,AMY: I pulled the zigzag plotter. 
407,[Doctor's room]
408,
409,"DOCTOR: What, you're standing with the door behind"
410,you? 
411,[Tardis]
412,
413,AMY: Yes.
414,
415,[Doctor's room]
416,
417,"DOCTOR: Okay, take two steps to your right and pull"
418,it again. 
419,"(Still the same switch, mind you.) "
420,"DOCTOR: Now, I must not use the sonic. I've got work to do. "
421,[Tardis]
422,
423,DOCTOR : Need to pick up a few items. 
424,AMY: Hey.
425,
426,[Aickman Road]
427,
428,(The Doctor returns to the terrace with a shopping
429,trolley full of miscellanea. A cat protests.) 
430,DOCTOR: Shush. Don't get comfortable.
431,
432,[Corridor]
433,
434,(Craig is waiting for the bathroom. The Doctor is
435,singing to the tune of La Donna e mobile.) 
436,"DOCTOR : Ta ra ra boom de ay quanda rilo, something is happening.) "
437,CRAIG: Doctor. 
438,DOCTOR : Hello? 
439,CRAIG: How long are you going to be in there? 
440,"DOCTOR : Oh, sorry. I like a good soak. "
441,(Banging from upstairs.) 
442,CRAIG: What the hell was that?
443,
444,[Bathroom]
445,
446,(The Doctor is in the shower.) 
447,DOCTOR: What did you say?
448,
449,[Corridor]
450,
451,CRAIG: I'm just going to go upstairs. See if he's
452,okay.
453,
454,[Bathroom]
455,
456,DOCTOR: Sorry? 
457,(Craig goes up the stairs.) 
458,DOCTOR: What did you say?
459,
460,[Upstairs door]
461,
462,(A grey haired figure opens the door on the chain.)
463,
464,MAN: Yes? Hello?
465,
466,[Bathroom]
467,
468,DOCTOR: Craig? 
469,"(The Doctor gets out of the shower, slips and falls.) "
470,DOCTOR: Ow.
471,
472,[Upstairs door]
473,
474,CRAIG: It's me from downstairs. I heard a big bang.
475,
476,[Bathroom]
477,
478,DOCTOR: No choice. It's sonicking time. 
479,(The Doctor grabs an electric toothbrush.)
480,
481,[Upstairs door]
482,
483,"MAN: Thank you, Craig, but I don't need your help."
484,
485,[House]
486,
487,"(The Doctor, with a towel around his waist, meets"
488,Craig at the foot of the stairs. He points the toothbrush at the
489,upstairs door and makes it go whirr.) 
490,"DOCTOR: What happened, what's going on? "
491,CRAIG: Is that my toothbrush? 
492,DOCTOR: Correct. You spoke to the man upstairs? 
493,CRAIG: Yeah. 
494,DOCTOR: What did he look like? 
495,"CRAIG: More normal than you do at the moment, mate. What are you doing?"
496,
497,DOCTOR: I thought you might be in trouble. 
498,"CRAIG: Thanks. Well, if I ever am, you can come and save me with my"
499,toothbrush. 
500,"(Craig's phone rings inside the flat, so he goes to answer it. The"
501,Doctor starts up the stairs as Sophie comes in the front door.) 
502,SOPHIE: Oh! Hello. 
503,DOCTOR: Ah! Hello. The Doctor. 
504,SOPHIE: Right. 
505,DOCTOR: You must be Sophie. 
506,(Air kisses for a greeting again.) 
507,SOPHIE: Oh. Oh.
508,
509,[Flat]
510,
511,"CRAIG: No, Dom's in Malta. There's nobody around."
512,"Hang on a sec. We've got a match today, pub league. We're one down if"
513,you fancy it? 
514,DOCTOR: Pub league. A drinking competition? 
515,"CRAIG: No, football. Play football. "
516,"DOCTOR: Football. Football. Yes, blokes play football. I'm good at"
517,"football, I think. "
518,"CRAIG: You've saved my life. I've got somebody. Yeah, all right, I'll"
519,"see you down there. Hey, Soph. "
520,"SOPHIE: Hey, I thought I'd come early and meet your new flat mate. "
521,"DOCTOR: Do you play, Sophie? "
522,"CRAIG: No, Soph just stands on the sidelines. She's my mascot. "
523,SOPHIE: I'm your mascot? Mascot? 
524,"CRAIG; Well, yeah, not my mascot. It's a football match. I can't take a"
525,date. 
526,SOPHIE: I didn't say I was your date. 
527,CRAIG: Neither did I. 
528,DOCTOR: Better get dressed. 
529,CRAIG: The spare kit's just in the bottom drawer. 
530,DOCTOR: Bit of a mess. 
531,(The Doctor goes into his room and shuts the door.) 
532,CRAIG: What do you think? 
533,SOPHIE: You didn't say he was gorgeous. 
534,(The Doctor puts his head out of his room.)

743,SOPHIE: Huh? What do you mean by that? 
744,"DOCTOR: So then, the call centre. That's no good, then. What do you"
745,really want to do? 
746,SOPHIE: Don't laugh. I only ever told Craig about it. I want to work
747,looking after animals. Maybe abroad? I saw this
748,orangutan sanctuary on telly. 
749,DOCTOR: What's stopping you? 
750,CRAIG: She can't. You need loads of qualifications. 
751,"SOPHIE: Yeah, true. Plus it's scary. Everyone I know lives round here."
752,"Like, Craig got offered a job in London. Better money. He didn't take"
753,it. 
754,CRAIG: What's wrong with staying here? I can't see the point of London.
755,
756,"DOCTOR: Well, perhaps that's you, then. Perhaps you'll just have to"
757,"stay here, secure and a little bit miserable, till the day you drop."
758,"Better than trying and failing, eh? "
759,SOPHIE: You think I'd fail?

761,"them, so why pretend? "

765,where you should be. 
766,SOPHIE: Why are you saying that? That's horrible. 
767,DOCTOR: Is it true? 
768,SOPHIE: Of course it's not true. I'm not staying in a call centre all
769,my life. I can do anything I want.

771,"SOPHIE: Oh, yeah. Right. Oh, my God. Did you see what he just did? "

1059,"DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, of course. The time engine isn't in the flat, the time"
1060,engine is the flat. Someone's attempt to build a Tardis. 
1061,"CRAIG: No, there's always been an upstairs. "
1062,(The door they have just come through flickers on and off.) 
1063,DOCTOR: Has there? Think about it. 
1064,CRAIG: Yes. No. I don't 
1065,DOCTOR: Perception filter. It's more than a disguise. It tricks your
1066,memory. 
1067,(Scream.) 
1068,"CRAIG: Sophie! Sophie! Oh, my God, Sophie! "
1069,(Sophie is being pulled towards the central console by electricity.) 
1070,SOPHIE: Craig. 
1071,DOCTOR: It's controlling her. It's willing her to touch the activator. 
1072,CRAIG: That's not going to have her. 
1073,(Sophie's hand is pulled onto a dome shaped control. The Doctor uses
1074,his sonic screwdriver.) 
1075,"DOCTOR: Ah, deadlock seal. "
1076,CRAIG: You've got to do something. 
1077,(Sophie falls back.) 
1078,"DOCTOR: What? Why's it let her go? So, okay. "
1079,(A man suddenly appears.) 
1080,AUTOPILOT: You will help me. 
1081,"DOCTOR: Right. Stop. Crashed ship, let's see. Hello, I'm Captain Troy"
1082,Handsome of International Rescue. Please state the nature of your
1083,emergency. 
1084,AUTOPILOT: The ship has crashed. The crew are dead. A pilot is
1085,required. 
1086,"DOCTOR: You're the emergency crash program. A hologram. What, you've"
1087,been luring people up here so you can try them out? 
1088,"(The hologram flickers between old man, young man and girl.) "
1089,AUTOPILOT: You will help me. You will help me. You will help me. 
1090,"SOPHIE: Craig, what is this? Where am I? "
1091,"DOCTOR: Hush. Human brains aren't strong enough, they just burn. But"
1092,"you're stupid, though. You just keep trying. "
1093,AUTOPILOT: Seventeen people have been tried. Six billion four hundred
1094,thousand and twenty six remain. 
1095,"SOPHIE: Seriously, what is going on? "
1096,"DOCTOR: Oh, for goodness sake. The top floor of Craig's building is in"
1097,reality an alien space ship intent on slaughtering the population of
1098,"this planet. Any questions? No, good. "
1099,"SOPHIE: Yes, I have questions. "
1100,AUTOPILOT: The correct pilot has now been found. 
1101,"DOCTOR: Yes, I was a bit worried that you were going to say that."
1102,
1103,[Tardis]
1104,
1105,"AMY: He means you, Doctor, doesn't he? "
1106,[Timeship]
1107,
1108,(The Autopilot uses its energy to drag the Doctor
1109,towards the console.) 
1110,AUTOPILOT: The correct pilot has been found. The correct pilot has been
1111,found. The correct pilot has been found.
1112,
1113,[Tardis]
1114,
1115,AMY: What's happening? 
1116,[Timeship]
1117,
1118,DOCTOR: It's pulling me in. I'm the new pilot. 
1119,AMY : Could you do it? 
1120,[Tardis]
1121,
1122,AMY: Could you fly the ship safely?
1123,
1124,[Timeship]
1125,
1126,"DOCTOR: No, I'm way too much for this ship. My hand"
1127,"touches that panel, the planet doesn't blow up, the whole solar system"
1128,does. 
1129,AUTOPILOT: The correct pilot has been found. 
1130,"DOCTOR: No. Worst choice ever, I promise you. Stop this. "
1131,AMY : Doctor? 
1132,[Tardis]
1133,
1134,AMY: It's getting worse. 
1135,[Timeship]
1136,
1137,"DOCTOR: It doesn't want everyone. Craig, it didn't"
1138,want you. 
1139,CRAIG: I spoke to him and he said I couldn't help him. 
1140,DOCTOR: It didn't want Sophie before but now it does. What's changed?
1141,"Argh. No. No, I gave her the idea of leaving. It's a machine that needs"
1142,to leave. It wants people who want to escape. And you don't want to
1143,"leave, Craig. You're Mister Sofa Man."
1144,
1145,[Tardis]
1146,
1147,AMY: Doctor!
1148,
1149,[Timeship]
1150,
1151,"DOCTOR: Craig, you can shut down the engine. Put"
1152,your hand on the panel and concentrate on why you want to stay. 
1153,"SOPHIE: Craig, no. "
1154,CRAIG: Will it work? 
1155,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1156,CRAIG: Are you sure? 
1157,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1158,CRAIG: Is that a lie? 
1159,DOCTOR: Of course it's a lie. 
1160,CRAIG: It's good enough for me. Geronimo! Argh! 
1161,(Craig puts his hand on the nearest control panel. The Doctor is
1162,released.) 
1163,SOPHIE: Craig!
1164,

1166,
1167,AMY: Doctor!
1168,
1169,[Timeship]
1170,
1171,(Smoke is coming off Craig's hand.) 
1172,"DOCTOR: Craig, what's keeping you here? Think about everything that"
1173,makes you want to stay here. Why don't you want to leave? 
1174,CRAIG: Sophie. I don't want to leave Sophie. I can't leave Sophie. I
1175,love Sophie. 
1176,"SOPHIE: I love you, too, Craig, you idiot. "
1177,(Sophie puts her hand on Craig's.)

1180,
1181,AMY: Doctor!
1182,
1183,[Timeship]
1184,
1185,"CRAIG: Honestly, do you mean that? "
1186,SOPHIE: Of course I mean it. Do you mean it? 
1187,"CRAIG: I've always meant it. Seriously though, do you mean it? "
1188,SOPHIE: Yes.
1189,
1190,[Tardis]
1191,
1192,AMY: Ugh. 
1193,CRAIG : What about the monkeys?
1194,
1195,[Timeship]
1196,
1197,"DOCTOR: Oh, not now, not again. Craig, the planet's"
1198,"about to burn. For God's sake, kiss the girl. "
1199,[Tardis]
1200,
1201,AMY: Kiss the girl!
1202,
1203,[Timeship]
1204,
1205,"(Craig and Sophie kiss, and his hand is released"
1206,from the panel. The Tardis stops shaking.) 
1207,AMY : Doctor? 
1208,[Tardis]
1209,
1210,AMY: You've done it. Ha ha!
1211,
1212,[Timeship]
1213,
1214,"AMY : You've done it. Oh, now the screen's just"
1215,"zeros. Now it's minus ones, minus twos, minus threes."
1216,
1217,[Tardis]
1218,
1219,AMY: Big yes. 
1220,AUTOPILOT: Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. 
1221,DOCTOR: Big no. 
1222,AUTOPILOT: Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. 
1223,(Craig and Sophie come up for air.) 
1224,CRAIG: Did we switch it off? 
1225,"DOCTOR: Emergency shutdown. It's imploding. Everybody out, out, out! "
1226,AUTOPILOT: Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me Help me. Help

1232,
1233,[Aickman Road]
1234,
1235,AUTOPILOT : Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me.
1236,
1237,"(The Doctor, Craig and Sophie run down the stairs and outside. The top"
1238,"floor and roof turn into the Timeship which then flies away, leaving a"
1239,totally incongruous one story building at the end of an entirely two
1240,storey terrace. A man walks by carrying a child.) 
1241,CRAIG: Look at them. Didn't they see that? The whole top floor just
1242,vanished. 
1243,DOCTOR: Perception filter. There never was a top floor.
1244,
1245,[Flat]
1246,
1247,(Craig and Sophie are snogging on the sofa.) 
1248,"CRAIG: So have we spoiled our friendship, then? "
1249,SOPHIE: Totally ruined it. 
1250,"CRAIG: And what about the monkeys? We could save them together, you"
1251,know. Do whatever we want. I could see the point of Paris if you were
1252,there with me. 
1253,"SOPHIE: First, let's destroy our friendship completely. "
1254,"(The Doctor enters from his room, and turns his back discreetly before"
1255,leaving the keys on the sideboard.) 
1256,CRAIG: Oi. 
1257,"SOPHIE: What, you're trying to sneak off? "
1258,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, you were sort of busy. "
1259,CRAIG: I want you to keep these. 
1260,(The keys.) 
1261,"DOCTOR: Thank you. Because I might pop back soon, have another little"
1262,stay. 
1263,"CRAIG: No, you won't. I've been in your head, remember. I still want"
1264,you to keep them. 
1265,"DOCTOR: Thank you, Craig. "
1266,"CRAIG: Thank you, Doctor. "
1267,DOCTOR: Sophie. Now then. Six billion four hundred thousand and twenty
1268,six people in the world. That's the number to beat. 
1269,SOPHIE: Yeah. 
1270,(The Doctor leaves. Behind the refrigerator with the photograph of the
1271,Doctor in his football kit is a crack in the wall.
1272,
1273,[Tardis]
1274,
1275,DOCTOR: Back in time. You need to go to the paper
1276,shop and leave that note for me. 
1277,"AMY: Right little matchmaker, aren't you? Can't you find me a fellow? "
1278,"DOCTOR: Oh, rectifier's playing up again Hold on. You write the note"
1279,and I'll change that will. 
1280,AMY: You got a pen?
