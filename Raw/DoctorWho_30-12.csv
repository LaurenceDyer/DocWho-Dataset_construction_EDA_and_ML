21,(The Tardis lands on the grass verge of a suburban
22,street.) 
23,"DOCTOR: It's fine. Everything's fine. Nothing's wrong, all fine. Excuse"
24,me. What day is it? 
25,MILKMAN: Saturday. 
26,"DOCTOR: Saturday. Good. Good, I like Saturdays. "
27,"DONNA: So, I just met Rose Tyler? "
28,DOCTOR: Yeah. 
29,DONNA: But she's locked away in a parallel world. 
30,DOCTOR: Exactly. If she can cross from her parallel world to your
31,"parallel world, than that means the walls of the universe are breaking"
32,"down, which puts everything in danger. Everything. But how? "
33,(The Doctor and Donna go back into the Tardis. The bottles on the milk
34,"float start to shake alarmingly, and tiles fall off roofs.)"
35,
36,[Tardis]
37,
38,"DONNA: The thing is, Doctor, no matter what's"
39,"happening, and I'm sure it's bad, I get that but, Rose is coming back."
40,Isn't that good? 
41,DOCTOR: Yeah. 
42,(Bang! The Tardis shakes.) 
43,DONNA: What the hell was that? 
44,DOCTOR: Don't know. It came from outside. 
45,(The Doctor opens the doors. There are just a few pieces of space rock
46,floating nearby.) 
47,DONNA: But we're in space. How did that happen? What did you do? 
48,(The Doctor checks the scanner readings.) 
49,DOCTOR: We haven't moved. We're fixed. It can't have. No. The Tardis is
50,"still in the same place, but the Earth has gone. The entire planet."
51,It's gone. 
52,[UNIT New York]
53,
54,"(Far across the universe, according to the caption,"
55,Martha Jones is lying on the upper floor of a skyscraper while sparks
56,and smoke go on around her.) 
57,MAN : Give me a Sit Rep right now. Confirm all stations still
58,online. Can anyone hear me? Have we got contact with UNIT base Geneva? 
59,MARTHA: What was that? 
60,WOMAN : Emergency systems online. 
61,"MARTHA: Was it some sort of earthquake, or? Jalandra, you all right? "
62,WOMAN : Start the back up generators. Get the unisystem
63,"operational. Come on, do it fast. "
64,(A man answers Martha.) 
65,"JALANDRA: Yeah, I'm okay. "
66,MARTHA: Is anyone hurt? We've lost power. Someone get the lights back
67,"on. DaCosta, see to it right now. Suzanne? Are you okay? "
68,(Suzanne is staring out of a window.) 
69,"SUZANNE: Martha, look at the sky. "
70,"MARTHA: Why, what is it? "
71,SUZANNE: Just look at the sky.
72,
73,[Torchwood]
74,
75,(A tremor has throws the furniture around in
76,"Cardiff, too.) "
77,"JACK: Whoa, what happened? Was it the Rift? Gwen? Ianto? You okay? "
78,IANTO: No broken bones. Slight loss of dignity. No change there then. 
79,GWEN: The whole of the city must've felt that. The whole of South
80,Wales. 
81,JACK: I'm going to take a look outside. 
82,(Jack runs out while Ianto activates a computer screen.) 
83,IANTO: A little bit bigger than South Wales.

85,[Sarah Jane's home]
86,
87,"(Ealing, London.) "
88,"SARAH: Luke, are you all right? "
89,LUKE: Felt like some sort of cross-dimensional spatial transference. 
90,SARAH: But it's night. It wasn't night. It was eight o'clock in the
91,"morning. Mister Smith, I need you. "
92,(A brick fireplace transforms into a computer.) 
93,SARAH: Can you just stop giving that fanfare? You just tell me what
94,happened. 
95,"MR SMITH: Sarah Jane, I think you should look outside. I think you'll"
96,find the visual evidence most conclusive.
97,
98,[Outside the Nobles' home]
99,
100,"WILF: It's gone dark. It's them aliens, I'll bet my"
101,"pension. What do you want this time, you green swine? "
102,(He brandishes his cricket bat.) 
103,SYLVIA: Dad. 
104,"WILF: Look, you get back inside, Sylvia. They always want the women. "
105,"SYLVIA: No, Dad, just look. Oh, my God. Look at the sky. "
106,[Outside Sarah Jane's house]
107,
108,SARAH: That's impossible.
109,
110,[Roald Dahl Plass]
111,
112,JACK: That's just impossible.
113,
114,[UNIT New York]
115,

118,[Street]
119,
120,(The milkman turns around to see a blonde woman
121,toting a honking great weapon pop into existence. She looks up.) 
122,"ROSE: Right, now we're in trouble. "
123,(She powers up the gun.) 
124,ROSE: It's only just beginning. 
125,"(Instead of distant stars, the sky is filled with other planets in"
126,close proximity.)
127,
128,[Tardis]
129,
130,"DONNA: But if the Earth's been moved, they've lost"
131,the Sun. What about my Mum? And
132,"Granddad? They're dead, aren't they? Are they dead? "
133,"DOCTOR: I don't know, Donna. I just don't know. I'm sorry, I don't"
134,know. 
135,DONNA: That's my family. My whole world. 
136,DOCTOR: There's no readings. Nothing. Not a trace. Not even a whisper.
137,"Oh, that is fearsome technology. "
138,DONNA: So what do we do? 
139,DOCTOR: We've got to get help. 
140,DONNA: From where? 
141,"DOCTOR: Donna, I'm taking you to the Shadow Proclamation. Hold tight."
142,
143,[Torchwood]
144,
145,AMNN [on TV]: The United Nations has issued an
146,"edict, asking the citizens of the world not to panic. So far, there has"
147,been no explanation of the twenty six planets which have appeared in
148,the sky 
149,RICHARD DAWKINS [on TV]: But it's an empirical fact. The planets didn't
150,"come to us, we came to them. Just look at the stars. We're in a"
151,completely different region of space. We've travelled. 
152,"PAUL O'GRADY [on TV]: do you know what, I look up and there's all these"
153,moons and things. Have you seen them? Did you see them? 
154,AUDIENCE [on TV]: Yeah! 
155,"PAUL O'GRADY [on TV]: I thought, what was I drinking last night,"
156,furniture polish? 
157,(Ianto laughs with the studio audience.) 
158,JACK: Ianto. Time and a place. 
159,"IANTO: He is funny, though. "
160,"JACK: Gwen, come and see. "
161,(Gwen is phoning her other half.) 
162,"GWEN: Rhys, I have no idea. Just stay indoors. And can you phone my"
163,"mother? Tell her, er, oh, I"
164,don't know. Just tell her to take her pills and go to sleep. I'm going
165,"to come home as soon as I can, I promise. I love you, you big idiot. "
166,"JACK: Someone's established an artificial atmospheric shell, keeping"
167,the air and holding in the heat. 
168,IANTO: Whoever's done this wants the human race alive. That's a plus.
169,"Twenty seven planets, including the Earth. "
170,"(As the planets on the scan move in their orbits, a flashing red dot"
171,appears in the middle.) 
172,"GWEN: No, but what's that? That's not a planet."
173,
174,[Sarah Jane's home]
175,
176,MR SMITH: The reading seems to be artificial in
177,construction. 
178,SARAH: Some sort of space station sitting at the heart of the web. 
179,"LUKE: They're fine. Maria and her dad, they're still in Cornwall. I"
180,told them to stay indoors. And Clyde's all right. He's with his mum. 
181,"MR SMITH: Sarah Jane, I have detected movement. Observe. "
182,LUKE: Spaceships.

189,you're not too busy. 
190,"MARTHA: I'm trying to phone the Doctor, sir. "
191,SANCHEZ: And? 
192,MARTHA: There's no signal. This number calls anywhere in the universe.
193,"It never breaks down. They must be blocking it, whoever they are. "
194,SANCHEZ: We're about to find out. They're coming into orbit.
195,
196,[London]
197,
198,(People are panicking and looting shops. Young men
199,"are driving their cars down the pavements whilst drinking, heedless of"
200,the pedestrians in their way.) 
201,"PASSENGER: Yeah, and you, mate! "
202,(Rose comes out of a subway.) 
203,"DRUNK: The end of the world, darling. End of the stinking world. "
204,"ROSE: Have one on me, mate. "
205,(Another shop window breaks and the alarm sounds. Rose goes over to see
206,two lads stealing computers and televisions.) 
207,[Shop]
208,
209,"ROSE: Right, you two. You can put that stuff down"
210,or run for your lives. Do you like my gun? 
211,(They run. She sits at a screen showing the red blobs approaching
212,Earth.)
213,
214,[Nobles' home]
215,
216,BBC NEWS [on TV]: We're now getting confirmed

219,SYLVIA: Dad? Come and see. 
220,BBC NEWS [on TV]: Are now heading towards Earth in a regular pattern.

222,BBC NEWS [on TV]: Organised flightplan. 
223,"WILF: No, no, there's no reply. Where are you, Donna? "

226,
227,[Torchwood]
228,
229,GWEN: Three thousand miles and closing. But who are
230,they?.

232,"JACK: Martha Jones, voice of a nightingale. Tell me you put something"
233,in my drink. 
234,[UNIT New York]
235,
236,MARTHA: No such luck. Have you heard from the
237,Doctor? 
238,JACK : Not a word. Where are you?

251,
252,MARTHA: Indigo's top secret. 
253,[Torchwood]
254,
255,MARTHA : No one's supposed to know about it. 
256,"JACK: I met a soldier in a bar, long story. "
257,IANTO: When was that? 
258,JACK: Strictly professional. 
259,"GWEN: Fifteen hundred miles, boys, and accelerating. They're almost"
260,here.
261,
262,[Sarah Jane's home]
263,
264,MR SMITH: I'm receiving a communication from the
265,earthbound ships. They have a message for the human race.

332,(We are shown lots of Daleks floating in the air.) 
333,DALEKS: Daleks are the masters of Earth. Daleks are the masters of

336,[Tardis]
337,
338,"DONNA: So go on then, what is the Shadow"

351,
352,[Shadow Proclamation]
353,
354,(A silver-haired woman in a black gown is pacing.) 
355,ARCHITECT: Time Lords are the stuff of legend. They belong in the myths
356,and whispers of the Higher Species. You cannot possibly exist. 
357,"DOCTOR: Yeah. More to the point, I've got a missing planet. "
358,ARCHITECT: Then you're not as wise as the stories would say. The
359,picture is far bigger than you imagine. The whole universe is in
360,"outrage, Doctor. Twenty four worlds have been taken from the sky. "
361,DOCTOR: How many?. Which ones? Show me. 
362,(He joins the woman at her computer screen.) 
363,"ARCHITECT: Locations range far and wide, but all disappeared at the"
364,"exact same moment, leaving no trace. "
365,DOCTOR: Callufrax Minorr. Jahoo. Shallacatop. Woman Wept. Clom. Clom's
366,gone? Who'd want Clom? 
367,"ARCHITECT: All different sizes. Some populated, some not. But all"
368,unconnected. 
369,DONNA: What about Pyrovillia? 
370,ARCHITECT: Who is the female? 
371,DONNA: Donna. I'm a human being. Maybe not the stuff of legend but
372,"every bit as important as Time Lords, thank you. Way back, when we were"
373,"in Pompeii, Lucius said Pyrovillia had gone missing. "
374,JUDOON: Pyrovillia is cold case. Not relevant. 
375,"DONNA: How do you mean, cold case? "
376,ARCHITECT: The planet Pyrovillia cannot be part of this. It disappeared
377,over two thousand years ago. 
378,"DONNA: Yes, yes, hang on. But there's the Adipose breeding planet, too."
379,"Miss Foster said that was lost, but that must've been a long time ago. "
380,"DOCTOR: That's it! Donna, brilliant. Planets are being taken out of"
381,time as well as space. Let's put this into 3-D. 
382,(Holograms of the missing planets start to fill the room.) 
383,"DOCTOR: Now, if we add Pyrovillia and Adipose Three. Something missing."
384,"Where else, where else, where else? Where else lost, lost, lost, lost."
385,Oh! The Lost Moon of Poosh. 
386,"(With the last sphere added, the representations suddenly reorganise"
387,themselves.) 
388,ARCHITECT: What did you do? 
389,DOCTOR: Nothing. The planets rearranged themselves into the optimum
390,"pattern. Oh, look at that. Twenty seven planets in perfect balance."
391,"Come on, that is gorgeous. "
392,"DONNA: Oi, don't get all spaceman. What does it mean? "
393,DOCTOR: All those worlds fit together like pieces of an engine. It's
394,like a powerhouse. What for? 
395,ARCHITECT: Who could design such a thing? 
396,DOCTOR: Someone tried to move the Earth once before. Long time ago.
397,Can't be.

450,Jones. Not from Torchwood. 
451,(Martha puts on the backpack.) 
452,MARTHA: But why me? 
453,"SANCHEZ: You're our only hope of finding the Doctor. But failing that,"
454,"if no help is coming, then with the power invested in me by the Unified"
455,"Intelligence Taskforce, I authorise you to take this. The Osterhagen"
456,Key. 
457,(A computer chip.)

472,light as the General and the soldier die.) 
473,JACK: Don't! 
474,IANTO: What's Project Indigo? 
475,JACK: Experimental teleport salvaged from the Sontarans. But they
476,"haven't got coordinates, or stabilisation. "

493,"DAVROS: I mean, is there news of him? "
494,RED DALEK [on screen]: Negative. No reports of Time Lord. We are beyond
495,the Doctor's reach. 
496,"DAVROS: Fascinating. If I had not elevated you beyond crude emotions, I"
497,could almost mistake that tone for one of victory. Beware your pride. 
498,RED DALEK [on screen]: The Doctor cannot stop us. 
499,"DAVROS: And yet, Dalek Caan is uneasy. "

521,ALBINO: You are something new. 
522,"DONNA: Not me. I'm just a temp. Shorthand, filing, hundred words per"

527,(The servant goes up the stairs. The Doctor walks over to Donna.) 
528,"DOCTOR: Donna, come on, think. Earth. There must've been some sort of"
529,"warning. Was anything happening back in your day, like electrical"

531,"DONNA: Well, how should I know? Er, no. I don't think so, no. "
532,"DOCTOR: Oh, okay, never mind. "
533,"DONNA: Although, there were the bees disappearing. "
534,DOCTOR: The bees disappearing. The bees disappearing. The bees
535,disappearing! 
536,ARCHITECT: How is that significant? 
537,DONNA: On Earth we had these insects. Some people said it was pollution
538,or mobile phone signals. 
539,"DOCTOR: Or, they were going back home. "
540,DONNA: Back home where? 
541,DOCTOR: Planet Melissa Majoria. 
542,DONNA: Are you saying bees are aliens?. 
543,DOCTOR: Don't be so daft. Not all of them. But if the migrant bees felt
544,"something coming, some sort of danger, and escaped? Tandocca. "
545,ARCHITECT: The Tandocca Scale. 
546,DOCTOR: Tandocca Scale is the series of wavelengths used as a carrier
547,signals by migrant bees. Infinitely small. No wonder we didn't see it.
548,"It's like looking for a speck of cinnamon in the Sahara, but look,"
549,there it is. The Tandocca trail. The transmat that moved the planets
550,"was using the same wavelength, we can follow the path. "

560,"ARCHITECT: Then according to the Strictures of the Shadow Proclamation,"
561,I will have to seize your transport and your technology. 
562,"DOCTOR: Oh, really? What for? "
563,ARCHITECT: The planets were stolen with hostile intent. We are
564,"declaring war, Doctor, right across the universe, and you will lead us"

1051,"DAVROS: Supreme One, this Subwave Network, I would address it. Give me"
1052,access.
1053,
1054,[Tardis]
1055,
1056,(The scanner goes blank.) 
1057,DOCTOR: Oh. 
1058,DONNA: We've lost them. 
1059,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. There's another signal coming through."
1060,There's someone else out there. Hello? Can you hear me? Rose? 
1061,"DAVROS : Your voice is different, and yet its arrogance is"
1062,unchanged. 
1063,[Sarah Jane's home]
1064,
1065,SARAH: No. But he's dead. 
1066,[Vault]
1067,
1068,DAVROS: Welcome to my new Empire 
1069,[Tardis]
1070,
1071,DAVROS [on screen]: Doctor. It is only fitting that
1072,you should bear witness to the resurrection and the triumph 
1073,[Vault]
1074,
1075,"DAVROS: Of Davros, lord and creator of the Dalek"
1076,race. 
1077,[Tardis]
1078,
1079,DONNA: Doctor? 
1080,DAVROS [on screen]: Have you nothing to say? 
1081,"DONNA: Doctor, it's all right. We're, we're in the Tardis. We're safe. "
1082,"DOCTOR: But you were destroyed. In the very first year of the Time War,"
1083,at the Gates of Elysium. 
1084,[Vault]
1085,
1086,DOCTOR [on screen]: I saw your command ship fly
1087,into the jaws of the Nightmare Child. 
1088,[Tardis]
1089,
1090,DOCTOR: I tried to save you. 
1091,DAVROS [on screen]: But it took one stronger than you. 
1092,[Vault]
1093,
1094,DAVROS: Dalek Caan himself. 
1095,CAAN: I flew into the wild and fire. I danced and died a thousand
1096,times. 
1097,DAVROS: Emergency Temporal Shift took him back into the Time War
1098,itself. 
1099,[Tardis]
1100,
1101,DOCTOR: But that's impossible. The entire War is
1102,timelocked. 
1103,[Vault]
1104,
1105,"DAVROS: And yet he succeeded. Oh, it cost him his"
1106,"mind, but imagine. A single, simple Dalek succeeded where Emperors and"
1107,"Time Lords have failed. A testament, don't you think, to my remarkable"
1108,creations? 
1109,[Tardis]
1110,
1111,DOCTOR: And you made a new race of Daleks. 
1112,[Vault]
1113,
1114,"DAVROS: I gave myself to them, quite literally."
1115,Each one grown from a cell of my own body. 
1116,(Davros opens his tunic to reveal his bare ribs with just a few nerve
1117,"endings over them, and his internal organs inside.) "
1118,DAVROS: New Daleks. 
1119,[Tardis]
1120,
1121,DAVROS [on screen]: True Daleks. I have my
1122,"children, Doctor. What do you have, now? "
1123,"DOCTOR: After all this time, everything we saw, everything we lost, I"
1124,have only one thing to say to you. Bye! 
1125,(He throws a lever and the Tardis flies off.)
1126,
1127,[Crucible]
1128,
1129,RED DALEK: Emergency. Locate the Tardis. Find the
1130,Doctor. 
1131,[Vault]
1132,
1133,DAVROS: He will go to the Earth to find his
1134,precious Human allies. 
1135,"CAAN: And death is coming. Oh, I can see it. Everlasting death for the"
1136,most faithful companion. 
1137,[Crucible]
1138,
1139,"DALEK: Subwave Network rerouted. New location,"
1140,Torchwood. 
1141,RED DALEK: Then exterminate them at once. Exterminate Torchwood.
1142,
1143,[Torchwood]
1144,
1145,"IANTO: Gwen, Dalek saucer heading for the Bay."
1146,They've found us. 
1147,"JACK: Martha, open that Indigo device. Now listen to me. Lift the"
1148,central panel. There's a string of numbers that keep changing
1149,
1150,[Francine's home]
1151,
1152,JACK [on phone]: But the fourth number keeps
1153,oscillating between two different digits. Tell me what they are. 
1154,MARTHA: It's a four and a nine. We could never work out what that was. 
1155,[Torchwood]
1156,
1157,"JACK: Yeah, that's the teleport base code. And"
1158,"that's all I need, to get this thing working again. "
1159,(Jack activates his wrist teleport.) 
1160,"JACK: Oscillating four and nine. Thank you, Martha Jones. "
1161,(Gwen gives Jack a big weapon.) 
1162,JACK: I've got to go. I've got to find the Doctor. I'll come back. I'm
1163,coming back. 
1164,GWEN: Don't worry about us. Just go. 
1165,IANTO: We'll be fine. 
1166,JACK: You'd better be. 
1167,(Jack vanishes. Boom! Rubble falls from the ceiling.) 
1168,DALEK : Exterminate. Exterminate. 
1169,GWEN: They're here.
1170,
1171,[Sarah Jane's home]
1172,
1173,MR SMITH: Tardis heading for vector seven. Grid
1174,reference six six five. 
1175,(Sarah runs for the door.) 
1176,LUKE: But there are Daleks out there. 
1177,"SARAH: I know,. I'm sorry, but I have got to find the Doctor. Don't"
1178,move. Don't leave the house. Don't do anything. 
1179,"MR SMITH: I will protect the boy, Sarah Jane. "
1180,SARAH: I love you. Remember that. 
1181,(Sarah runs out to her car and drives off.)
1182,
1183,[Nobles' home]
1184,
1185,(Rose has collected her gun and is making a phone
1186,call.) 
1187,"ROSE: Control, I need another shift. Lock me onto the Tardis, now."
1188,"Right, I'm going to"
1189,find him. Wish me luck. 
1190,"SYLVIA: Oh, good luck. "
1191,"WILF: Yeah, good luck, sweetheart. "
1192,(Rose vanishes in a blinding flash.)
1193,
1194,[Outside the church]
1195,
1196,(The one where Donna was supposed to get married?) 
1197,DONNA: Like a ghost town. 
1198,"DOCTOR: Sarah Jane said they were taking the people. What for? Think,"
1199,"Donna. When you met Rose in that parallel world, what did she say? "
1200,"DONNA: Just, the darkness is coming. "
1201,DOCTOR: Anything else? 
1202,DONNA: Why don't you ask her yourself? 
1203,(Rose is walking down the street towards them. The Doctor runs to her.)
1204,
1205,DALEK: Exterminate. 
1206,"(The Dalek's ray grazes the Doctor, but still lights him up and knocks"
1207,him down. Jack appears and blasts the Dalek. Rose gets to the Doctor
1208,first.) 
1209,"ROSE: I've got you. It missed you. Look, it's me, Doctor. "
1210,DOCTOR: Rose. 
1211,ROSE: Hi. 
1212,DOCTOR: Long time no see. 
1213,"ROSE: Yeah. Been busy, you know. Don't die. Oh, my God. Don't die. Oh"
1214,"my god, don't die. "
1215,"JACK: Get him into the Tardis, quick. Move. "
1216,[Torchwood]
1217,
1218,(Gwen fetches machine guns.) 
1219,IANTO: But they don't work against Daleks. 
1220,"GWEN: Yeah? Well, I'm going out fighting. Like Owen, like Tosh. How"
1221,about you? 
1222,DALEK : Exterminate. 
1223,"IANTO: Yes, ma'am. "
1224,DALEKS: Exterminate.
1225,
1226,[Tardis]
1227,
1228,"DONNA: What, what do we do?. There must be some"
1229,medicine or something. 
1230,"JACK: Just step back. Rose, do as I say, and get back. He's dying and"
1231,you know what happens next. 
1232,DONNA: What do you mean? He can't. 
1233,"ROSE: Oh, no. I came all this way. "
1234,"DONNA: What do you mean, what happens next? "
1235,(The Doctor right hand begins to glow.) 
1236,DOCTOR: It's starting.
1237,
1238,[Sarah Jane's car]
1239,
1240,(Sarah screeches to a halt behind two Daleks. They
1241,turn around slowly.)

1243,SARAH: I surrender. I'm sorry! 
1244,DALEK: Daleks do not accept apologies. You will be exterminated. 
1245,DALEK 2: Exterminate. 
1246,DALEK: Exterminate.
1247,
1248,[Torchwood]

1254,
1255,"JACK: Here we go. Good luck, Doctor. "
1256,DONNA: Will someone please tell me what is going on?. 
1257,"ROSE: When he's dying, his er, his body, it repairs itself. It changes."
1258,But you can't! 
1259,"DOCTOR: I'm sorry, it's too late. I'm regenerating."
