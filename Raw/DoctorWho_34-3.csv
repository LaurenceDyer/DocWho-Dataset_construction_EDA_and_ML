21,
22,(The Doctor is doing Gallifreyan maths on a blackboard
23,up on the
24,"gallery, near his bookcase. Clara is down by the console, swivelling in"
25,his easy chair.)
26,DOCTOR: Take a punt.
27,
28,CLARA: Right.
29,
30,"DOCTOR: Your choice. Wherever, whenever, anywhere in time and space."
31,
32,"CLARA: Well, there is something, someone that I've always wanted to"
33,meet.
34,But I know what you'll say.
35,
36,DOCTOR: 
37,Try me.
38,
39,CLARA: 
40,"You'll say he's made up, that there is no such thing."
41,
42,DOCTOR: 
43,Go on.
44,
45,CLARA: 
46,It's. It's Robin Hood.
47,
48,DOCTOR: Robin Hood.
49,
50,(Clara goes up to the gallery.)
51,"CLARA: Yeah. I love that story. I've always loved it, ever since I was"
52,little.
53,
54,"DOCTOR: Robin Hood, the heroic outlaw, who robs from the rich and gives"
55,to the
56,poor.
57,
58,CLARA: Yeah.
59,
60,DOCTOR: He's made up. There's no such thing.
61,
62,"CLARA: Ah, you see? "
63,(The Doctor takes a book from the bookcase.)
64,
65,DOCTOR: 
66,"Old-fashioned heroes only exist in old-fashioned story books, Clara."
67,
68,CLARA: 
69,And what about you?
70,
71,DOCTOR: 
72,Me?
73,
74,CLARA: 
75,"Yeah, you. You stop bad things happening every minute of every day."
76,That sounds pretty heroic to me.
77,
78,(The Doctor licks something from a large metal spoon. Custard?)
79,DOCTOR: 
80,"Just passing the time. Hey, what about Mars?"
81,
82,CLARA: 
83,What?!
84,DOCTOR: 
85,The Ice Warrior Hives.
86,
87,CLARA: 
88,You said it was my choice.
89,
90,DOCTOR: 
91,Or the Tumescent Arrows of the Half-Light. Those girls can hold their
92,drink.
93,CLARA: 
94,Doctor.
95,
96,DOCTOR: And
97,fracture fifteen different levels of reality simultaneously. I think
98,I've got a Polaroid somewhere.
99,
100,CLARA: 
101,Doctor! My choice. Robin Hood. Show me.
102,(They go down to the console.)
103,DOCTOR: 
104,Very well.
105,
106,(He sets the coordinates.)
107,DOCTOR: Earth. England. Sherwood Forest. 1190AD. Ish. But
108,you'll only be
109,disappointed.
110,
111,"(He sets the Tardis flying. Meanwhile,"
112,the first Doctor is meeting Richard the Lionheart at the Crusades.)
113,
114,[By a stream]
115,
116,"(The birds are singing, and a long tree trunk has been placed"
117,across the stream to act as a bridge. The Tardis materialises slightly
118,up the slope and the Doctor steps out.)
119,DOCTOR: 
120,"No damsels in distress, no pretty castles, no such thing as Robin Hood."
121,(An
122,arrow slams into the Tardis next to him. A figure in dressed in Lincoln
123,Green pops up from behind a tree trunk on the other side of the
124,stream.)
125,
126,ROBIN: 
127,You called?
128,"(and winks.) Very, very nicely done with the box, sir. I saw a Turk"
129,perform
130,something very similar at Nottingham Fayre. 
131,"(The Doctor pulls the arrow out, and the hole vanishes.)"
132,"ROBIN: It's a trick with mirrors,"
133,no doubt?
134,
135,DOCTOR: 
136,A trick?
137,
138,ROBIN: 
139,"A good jest. Ha, ha!"
140,DOCTOR: 
141,This is not a trick. This is a Tardis.
142,
143,ROBIN: 
144,"Whatever it is, you bony rascal, I'm afraid I must relieve you of it."
145,
146,DOCTOR: 
147,"It's my property, that's what it is."
148,
149,ROBIN: 
150,"Well, don't you know all property is theft to Robin Hood?"
151,
152,(Robin stands in the middle of the 'bridge' without his bow and arrows.)
153,DOCTOR: 
154,You're not serious.
155,
156,ROBIN: I'm many
157,"things, sir, but I'm never that. Robin Hood laughs in the face"
158,of all.
159,"Ha, ha, ha."
160,DOCTOR: 
161,And do people ever punch you in the face when you do that?
162,
163,ROBIN: 
164,Not as yet.
165,
166,DOCTOR: 
167,"Lucky I'm here then, isn't it?"
168,
169,"(Clara comes out of the Tardis, dressed in a red medieval-style"
170,"dress, with long cut-away sleeves and a thin girdle around her hips."
171,There is also a silver rope across her forehead that stays in place as
172,if glued there.)
173,CLARA: 
174,"Might be a little bit much, but what do you reckon, Doctor?"
175,
176,ROBIN: 
177,By all the saints. Are there any more in there?
178,
179,CLARA: 
180,Is that?
181,
182,DOCTOR: No.
183,
184,"CLARA: Oh, my God. Oh, my God! It is, isn't it? You found him. You"
185,actually
186,found Robin Hood.
187,
188,(Clara goes very girlish and giggly.)
189,DOCTOR: 
190,That is not Robin Hood.
191,
192,ROBIN: 
193,"Well then, who, sir, is about to relieve you of your magic box?"
194,
195,(Robin draws his long sword. The Doctor walks onto the bridge.)
196,DOCTOR: 
197,"Nobody, sir. Not in this universe or the next."
198,
199,ROBIN: 
200,"Well then, draw your sword and prove your words."
201,
202,DOCTOR: 
203,I have no sword. I don't need a sword. 
204,(The Doctor opens his coat and turns to prove it.) 
205,DOCTOR: Because I am the Doctor. 
206,(He dons a gauntlet.)
207,DOCTOR: And
208,this is my spoon.
209,En garde!
210,
211,(They trade thrusts and parries. The spoon stands up to the sword
212,very well. The Doctor hits Robin on the back of the neck as he passes
213,him.)
214,ROBIN: Ow!
215,
216,CLARA: You're amazing.
217,
218,DOCTOR: I've had some experience. Richard the Lionheart. Cyrano de
219,Bergerac.
220,Errol Flynn. He had the most enormous 
221,CLARA: Ahem.
222,DOCTOR: Ego.
223,
224,CLARA: Takes one to know one.
225,(The Doctor slaps Robin's backside.)
226,"ROBIN: Oh, you. "
227,(And
228,retaliates by cutting a button off the Doctor's coat. So the Doctor
229,holds his arms wide open and Robin lunges with his sword. The Doctor
230,deflects it and does a little turn so that he and
231,Robin are back to back on the trunk. Then he sticks out his bottom and
232,pushes Robin into the water. Splash!) 
233,CLARA: Doctor!
234,
235,(The Doctor polishes his spoon.)
236,DOCTOR: 
237,Like I said. My box.
238,
239,CLARA: Doctor?
240,
241,(They look into the water. Robin is not visible. Because he pops up
242,behind the Doctor and pushes him into the water. Clara and Robin laugh.)
243,
244,[Settlement]
245,
246,"(A few thatched wattle-and-daub buildings, and a Celtic"
247,cross on a plinth. Knights in full armour are making the
248,chickens scatter. A young woman is being dragged away chained
249,to yoke across her shoulders. An old
250,man runs up.)
251,"QUAYLE: In the name of all that's holy, take our money, take our"
252,"treasure, but"
253,spare my ward.
254,QUAYLES WARD: Do not fuss. All will be well.
255,
256,QUAYLE: This is the Sheriff's doing.
257,"If he were here now, I'd tear out his black heart! "
258,(A figure back-lit sitting on a horse speaks.)
259,SHERIFF: Would you now?
260,
261,(He dismounts.)
262,"SHERIFF: Or are you as milk-livered as your name suggests, Master"
263,Quayle?
264,
265,QUAYLE: Take me. Spare this dear child.
266,
267,SHERIFF: Take you? A lardy lack-wit like you? It's labour we require up
268,at the
269,castle. Labour and gold. Not old men and their worthless baubles. This
270,"will be a great help, Master Quayle, believe me. Newcomer to Sherwood,"
271,are we?
272,
273,"QUAYLES WARD: Yes, my Lord."
274,
275,SHERIFF: You may also prove useful. Bring her.
276,
277,"QUAYLE: Your days are numbered, you cur."
278,
279,(Quayle spits in the Sheriff's face.)
280,"SHERIFF: You shall live to regret that. Actually, no. You won't."
281,
282,(The Sheriff stabs Quayle in the stomach.)
283,QUAYLES WARD:  No! No!
284,
285,
286,[Outlaw's hideaway]
287,
288,(In a
289,narrow gullly.The outlaws live in shallow caves under the treeline.
290,Robin is making me think of a subdued Lord Flashheart from Blackadder
291,"2, with Clara as Bob.)"
292,ROBIN: Let me introduce you to my men. This is Will
293,Scarlet.
294,He is a cheeky
295,rogue with a good sword arm and a slippery tongue.
296,
297,WILL: My lady.
298,
299,"(The Doctor pulls some of his hair out as he bows, and scans it with"
300,the sonic screwdriver.)
301,WILL: Argh! What do you want with my hair?
302,
303,DOCTOR: 
304,"Well, it's realistic, I'll give you that."
305,
306,ROBIN: 
307,And this is Friar Tuck. Aptly named for the amount of grub he tucks
308,into.
309,TUCK: You skinny blackguard.
310,
311,"(These men laugh a lot. As he steps forward, he nearly falls.)"
312,TUCK: What are you doing?
313,
314,(The Doctor stands up with one of his sandals)
315,DOCTOR: 
316,This isn't a real sandal.
317,"TUCK: Yes, it is."
318,
319,DOCTOR: (sniffs)
320,"Oh. Yes, it is."
321,
322,ROBIN: 
323,"This, er, is Alan-a-Dale. He's a master of the lute, whose music"
324,brightens
325,up these dark days.
326,
327,"ALAN: (sings) Stranger you are welcome here, in Sherwood's bonny glade."
328,Ow!
329,
330,(The Doctor has jabbed his arm with a hypodermic gizmo.)
331,DOCTOR: 
332,"Sorry, sorry, sorry. Blood analysis. Oh. All those diseases. If you"
333,"were real, you'd be dead in six months."
334,
335,ALAN: I am real.
336,
337,DOCTOR: Bye.
338,
339,ROBIN: And this
340,is John Little. Called Little John. He's my loyal companion
341,in many an adventure. 
342,"(The man mountain steps aside and a small man jumps forward, to general"
343,merriment.)
344,CLARA: Oh! 
345,WILL: Works every time.
346,"CLARA: Oh, I"
347,"cannot believe this. You, you really are Robin Hood and his Merry"
348,Men.
349,ROBIN: 
350,"Aye! That is an apt description. What say you, lads?"
351,
352,ALL: Aye!
353,
354,DOCTOR: 
355,Stop laughing. Why are you always doing that? Are you all simple or
356,something? I'm going to need a sample.
357,
358,(The Doctor picks up a goblet and throws away the contents before
359,walking up to Robin..)
360,ROBIN: Of what?
361,
362,CLARA: Ahem. Excuse
363,me. Sorry. What are you doing?
364,
365,DOCTOR: 
366,"Well, they're not holograms, that much is obvious. Could be a theme"
367,park from the future. Or we might be inside a miniscope.
368,
369,(As in Carnival of Monsters)
370,CLARA: 
371,"Oh, shut up."
372,
373,"DOCTOR: A miniscope. Yes, of course. Why not?"
374,
375,ROBIN: 
376,Your friend seems not quite of the real world.
377,
378,CLARA: 
379,"No. No, he's not really. Not most of the time. Dark days?"
380,
381,ROBIN: My lady?
382,
383,CLARA: 
384,You said that these were dark days. What did you mean?
385,
386,"WILL: King Richard is away on crusade, my lady. His tyrant of a brother"
387,rules
388,instead.
389,
390,CLARA: 
391,"And the Sheriff. Cos there is a sheriff, right? "
392,ALAN: Aye.
393,It is indeed this jackal of the princes who seeks to oppress us for
394,ever more.
395,
396,DOCTOR: 
397,Or six months in your case.
398,
399,ROBIN: It is a shame to dwell on murky thoughts when there is such
400,beauty
401,here. 
402,CLARA: Why are
403,you so sad?
404,
405,ROBIN: Why do you think me sad?
406,
407,CLARA: 
408,"Because the Doctor's right, you laugh too much."
409,
410,ROBIN: 
411,"You know, I do not live this outlaw life by choice."
412,You see before you Robert.
413,BOTH: Earl of Loxley. 
414,CLARA: 
415,Yes. 
416,ROBIN: Yes.
417,
418,CLARA: Sorry. Do go on.
419,
420,ROBIN: 
421,"I er, I had my lands and titles stripped from me. I dared to speak"
422,out against Prince John. But I lost the thing most dear to me.
423,
424,CLARA: 
425,What was she called?
426,
427,ROBIN: You're
428,so very quick. How does the Doctor stand it?
429,
430,CLARA: 
431,Marian?
432,
433,ROBIN: 
434,You know her?
435,
436,"CLARA: Oh, yes."
437,I have always known her.
438,
439,ROBIN: 
440,"It was Marian who told me that I must stand up and be counted. But, I"
441,was afraid. Now this green canopy is my palace and the rough ground my
442,"feather bed. Maybe one day I will return home, but until that day."
443,"Until that day, it is beholden on me to be the man Marian wanted, to be"
444,a hero for those this tyrant sheriff slaughters.
445,
446,DOCTOR: 
447,"What time is it, Mister Hood?"
448,
449,ROBIN: 
450,Somewhat after noon.
451,
452,"DOCTOR: No, no."
453,Time of year? What season?
454,
455,ROBIN: 
456,"Oh, Dame Autumn has draped her mellow skirts about the forest, Doctor."
457,The time of mists and harvest approaches.
458,
459,DOCTOR: 
460,"Yeah, yeah. All very poetic. But it's very green hereabouts, though,"
461,isn't it? Like
462,"I said, very sunny."
463,
464,CLARA: 
465,So?
466,
467,DOCTOR: 
468,Have you been to Nottingham?
469,
470,CLARA: Climate change?
471,
472,DOCTOR: It's 1190.
473,
474,ROBIN: 
475,You must excuse me. The Sheriff has issued a proclamation and tomorrow
476,there is to be a contest to find the best archer in the land. And the
477,"bounty, it's an arrow made of pure gold."
478,
479,CLARA: No!
480,"Don't, don't go. It's a trap."
481,
482,ROBIN: 
483,"Well, of course it is! But a contest to find the best archer"
484,in the land? There is no contest. 
485,(General hilarity.)
486,"DOCTOR: Right,"
487,that isn't even funny. That was bantering. I am totally against
488,bantering.
489,
490,CLARA: 
491,How can you be so sure he is not the real thing?
492,
493,DOCTOR: 
494,Because he can't be.
495,
496,CLARA: When did you stop believing in everything?
497,
498,DOCTOR: When did you start believing in impossible heroes?
499,
500,CLARA: 
501,"Don't you know? In a way, it's rather sweet."
502,
503,(The Doctor bites into an apple then scans it with his screwdriver.)
504,
505,[Archery ground]
506,
507,(We are shown Caerphilly Castle with
508,"its artificial lakes, which was built from 1268 onwards. Nottingham"
509,Castle is built on castle rock by the river with the city around it.
510,The contest is taking place in the central ward.)
511,"HERALD: In the contest for the golden arrow, after ten rounds,"
512,the battle is
513,betwixt our Lord Sheriff
514,
515,(Obligatory cheers from the crowd.)
516,HERALD: And the stranger known as Tom the Tinker.
517,
518,(Robin in a wide-brimmed leather hat gets a rousing reception.)
519,SHERIFF: Perhaps not such a stranger after all.
520,
521,HERALD: Take your places.
522,"ROBIN: Shall we make the contest a little more interesting, my Lord?"
523,The
524,targets seem a little close. What say you? Another twenty paces?
525,
526,SHERIFF: Why not?
527,
528,(The central target is moved back. The Sheriff fires his black arrow
529,into the middle of the bulls-eye.)
530,"SHERIFF: Now, Tinker. Let us see thy true face. "
531,(Robin's white-fletched arrow splits the Sheriff's.)
532,"HERALD: Ye Gads! He has split the arrow! Truly, he is the finest archer"
533,in all
534,"England. Come forward, Tinker. And claim your prize."
535,
536,"(But before Robin can take the prize, an arrow with multicoloured"
537,feathers splits his own. It is the Doctor's.)
538,"LITTLE JOHN: He's full of surprises, isn't he?"
539,
540,DOCTOR: I'm the
541,Doctor. My skills as a bowman speak for themselves. I claim my
542,reward.
543,
544,(The Herald kneels and the Doctor takes the prize.)
545,DOCTOR: A mere bauble. 
546,(He throws it away in the general direction of the Merry Men.) 
547,DOCTOR: I want something else.
548,
549,SHERIFF: Name it.
550,
551,DOCTOR: 
552,Enlightenment.
553,
554,(Robin splits the Doctor's arrow. The crowd roars. The Doctor's
555,next arrow ricochets off a guard's armour to split Robin's. Robin
556,retaliates by not even looking when he looses his missile.)
557,DOCTOR: This is getting silly.
558,
559,"(The Doctor points his sonic screwdriver at the target, and it explodes"
560,in a ball of flame.)
561,SHERIFF: Fascinating. Seize him!
562,
563,(The three knights draw their swords. Clara takes what looks like
564,an anachronistic halberd from a rack and tries to swing it. It is too
565,heavy for her.)
566,DOCTOR: What are you doing? Put that down.
567,
568,CLARA: I'm fine. I take
569,Year Seven for after school Tae Kwon Do.
570,
571,ROBIN: 
572,"Don't worry, Doctor. I'll save you."
573,
574,DOCTOR: 
575,I don't need saving.
576,
577,ROBIN: Your
578,honour is safe.
579,
580,DOCTOR: I know.
581,
582,ROBIN: For I am Robin.
583,(He removes his hat and every one cheers.)
584,ROBIN: Robin Hood!
585,
586,(Robin severs one of the knights' arms. It falls to the ground and
587,sparks a bit.)
588,VOICE : Witchery! Witchery!
589,(The Doctor picks the arm up.)
590,DOCTOR: Robot.
591,
592,(The knight's visor opens to reveal a metal face. A violet light shines
593,in a cross pattern from between its eyebrows.)
594,DOCTOR: Now we're getting somewhere.
595,SHERIFF: Take them. Kill the rest. Kill them all!
596,
597,(The robot knights fire energy bolts from their foreheads.)
598,DOCTOR: He surrenders!
599,
600,ROBIN: What?
601,
602,DOCTOR: Hai!
603,
604,(The Doctor uses Venusian aikido to knock Robin's sword out of his
605,hand.)
606,"ROBIN: You miserable cur. I had them on the run. Flee, lads, flee! Live"
607,to fight another day!
608,
609,TUCK: Come on!
610,(The Merry Men run for their lives.)
611,SHERIFF: To the dungeons with all of them.
612,CLARA: What are you up to?
613,
614,DOCTOR: 
615,"Quickest way to find out anybody's plans, get yourself captured."
616,
617,[Castle]
618,
619,(Somewhere
620,with little lighting and a high roof. There are screams somewhere and a
621,giant bubbling crucible. A
622,man carrying a bucket collapses on the floor.)
623,"QUAYLES WARD: Here, let me help you."
624,
625,"WALTER: Thank you, Lady."

687,"Oh, right, here we go. It's laughing time."

787,Can you explain your plan without using the word sonic screwdriver?
788,Because you might have forgotten the Sheriff of Nottingham has taken
789,"your sonic screwdriver, just saying."

809,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. no. He will get nothing from me, because"

899,

901,for?

904,So as to attract the attention of that gargoyle-faced guard.

954,
955,DOCTOR: 
956,He's like this whenever he's in any kind of danger. He just can't seem
957,to cope. He gets so afraid. He goes into a kind of fit. I honestly
958,"believe that he may die of sheer fright, like some tiny, shivering"

1027,Mmm.

1049,Why so?

1079,"from the heavenly spheres, bedight with twinkling lights and"
1080,miracles beyond imagining. The most beautiful thing the brave and
1081,handsome man had ever seen.

1083,And I suppose the mechanical men saw you as their natural leader?

1192,(The computer screen gives all the details.)

1194,more sophisticated. It disguised itself as
1195,a twelfth century castle. 
1196,(Graphic shows the spaceship landing pointy bit upwards and pretending
1197,to be the central keep.)

1213,what does every oppressed peasant workforce need? The illusion of

1239,good.
1240,
1241,SHERIFF: Kill him. Kill Robin Hood.
1242,
1243,"DOCTOR: You can drop all that stuff now, Sheriff."
1244,
1245,CLARA: Doctor?
1246,
1247,DOCTOR: He is
1248,not what you think he is. This is all play-acting.
1249,
1250,CLARA: We can't just let them kill him!
1251,
1252,"DOCTOR: You're not fooling anyone, Sheriff."
1253,
1254,(A blast from a knight knocks Robin off his feet. Clara gets
1255,between him and the attacker. Robin grabs her around the waist and they
1256,back up to a window.)
1257,CLARA: What the hell are you doing?
1258,
1259,ROBIN: Surviving. 
1260,CLARA: No!
1261,"(Robin falls backwards through the window, taking Clara with him.)"
1262,DOCTOR: No! Clara!
1263,
1264,(Robin and Clara land in the moat. The full moon is reflected in the
1265,rippling water.)
1266,"SHERIFF: Yeah, sorry about the girl. Such a pretty thing. What a queen"
1267,she
1268,would have made.
1269,
1270,(The Sheriff turns away. The Doctor sees Robin climb out of the other
1271,side of the moat with Clara in his arms.)
1272,DOCTOR: Stop
1273,pretending. You and your fancy robots. I get it. I understand.
1274,
1275,"SHERIFF: Oh, so you too know my plans?"
1276,
1277,DOCTOR: You and
1278,your robots plundering the surrounding countryside for all it's
1279,worth. Gold. Gold. Of course. Gold. You are creating a matrix of gold
1280,to repair the
1281,engine circuitry.
1282,SHERIFF: This is
1283,the scheme the Mechanicals have devised. Soon this skyship will
1284,"depart. Destination, London. There I will obliterate the King and"
1285,take my rightful place as ruler of this sceptred isle.
1286,
1287,DOCTOR: It won't work. There's
1288,not a chance. I've seen the instruments. There's
1289,been too much damage. You are stoking up a gigantic bomb!
1290,
1291,SHERIFF: Shush.
1292,(A knight knocks the Doctor out.) 
1293,
1294,[Castle]
1295,
1296,KNIGHT : Engine capacity at forty eight percent.
1297,
1298,(Knights carry a gold circuit board away. The Doctor wakes up.)
1299,KNIGHT : Engine capacity at forty eight percent.
1300,
1301,DOCTOR: It's not
1302,enough. That's not enough. It'll never make orbit.
1303,
1304,(Amongst the wails and groans of downtrodden humanity there is a
1305,mechanical whumph!)
1306,"DOCTOR: That's the engines, building in power."
1307,"Stupid, stupid Sheriff."
1308,
1309,(He strains at the chains holding his wrists behind his back.)
1310,"DOCTOR: Argh! Go on, give!"
1311,"Give, you stupid things."
1312,What are you looking at?
1313,
1314,(It is Quayle's ward.)
1315,
1316,[Outlaw's hideout]
1317,
1318,"(Next morning, Clara wakes to the sight of Robin's"
1319,face.)
1320,CLARA: Hi.
1321,
1322,ROBIN: The time for games is over.
1323,
1324,
1325,[Castle]
1326,
1327,QUAYLES WARD: I think I understand you. The Sheriff's using the gold to
1328,replace
1329,something.
1330,DOCTOR: That's the principle. But he's a moron. If he tries to fly this
1331,"ship,"
1332,it'll explode and wipe out half the country. What we need is a
1333,little riot. Time to reflect on lasers and gold. Spread the word.
1334,
1335,(Quayle's ward frees the Doctor's hands.)
1336,
1337,[Outlaw's hideout]
1338,
1339,ROBIN: You will tell me everything this Doctor knows
1340,about Robin Hood and his
1341,Merry Men.
1342,
1343,CLARA: What is
1344,this? Why are you interrogating me?
1345,
1346,"ROBIN: And then, you will tell me exactly who this Doctor is and what"
1347,are his
1348,plans.
1349,
1350,
1351,[Castle]
1352,
1353,KNIGHT: You are fit for labour. Stand aside while this
1354,peasant unit is freed.
1355,
1356,DOCTOR: I'm
1357,afraid you're a little late.
1358,
1359,KNIGHT: Explain.
1360,
1361,DOCTOR: I'm
1362,already free!
1363,
1364,(The knight powers up his violet beam. The Doctor reflects it with
1365,a golden plate and it hits the wall. Quayle's ward produces another
1366,plate and this time it is bounced straight back at the knight. It's
1367,"head explodes. More knights come, but all the workers have plates for"
1368,shields.)
1369,
1370,[Sheriff's room]
1371,
1372,(The Sheriff is annotating a map of England.)
1373,"SHERIFF: Mine, mine, mine."
1374,
1375,KNIGHT: Engine capacity at seventy five percent.
1376,
1377,(There is a beeping noise. The Sheriff pushes the papers aside to
1378,reveal a monitor in the wooden table. He watches the carnage that is
1379,taking place.)
1380,SHERIFF: 'Ods blood!
1381,Who will rid me of this turbulent Doctor?
1382,
1383,(He punches a knight. It hurts.)
1384,SHERIFF: Come.
1385,
1386,
1387,[Castle]
1388,
1389,"(People are screaming and dying, but so are the knights.) "
1390,"DOCTOR: Everyone, the last one!"
1391,
1392,(It is surrounded by reflective surfaces. Its violet
1393,"energy beam bounces around a lot until if finally returns to sender,"
1394,multiplied several times. KaBOOM! Celebrations.)
1395,"DOCTOR: Out, out! Everyone, quickly, get out. Quickly!"
1396,
1397,"QUAYLES WARD: You've saved us all, clever one. "
1398,(She kissees him on the cheek.)
1399,QUAYLES WARD: Thank you.
1400,
1401,KNIGHT: Engine capacity at eighty two percent.
1402,
1403,"SHERIFF: You are indeed an ingenious fellow, Doctor. But do you really"
1404,think
1405,your peasants' revolt can stop me?
1406,
1407,DOCTOR: I rather
1408,think you're the revolting one around here. I'm bantering. I'm
1409,bantering. Listen
1410,to me. You don't have enough gold content to seal the engine breach. If
1411,"you try and take off, you'll wipe out half of England."
1412,
1413,SHERIFF: Liar!
1414,"From my sky vessel, I shall rule omnipotent."
1415,
1416,DOCTOR: You
1417,"pudding-headed primitive, shut down the engines. What you're doing"
1418,will alter the course of history.
1419,
1420,SHERIFF: I
1421,"sincerely hope so, or I wouldn't be bothering."
1422,
1423,(The Sheriff throws a knight's head into the crucible.)
1424,DOCTOR: Listen to me. It doesn't have to end like this. Shut it all
1425,"down,"
1426,return Clara to me and I'll do what I can.
1427,
1428,SHERIFF: I don't
1429,have Clara.
1430,
1431,DOCTOR: Robin's
1432,one of yours.
1433,SHERIFF: What did
1434,you say?
1435,
1436,DOCTOR: He's one
1437,"of your tin-headed puppets, just like these brutes here."
1438,
1439,SHERIFF: Robin
1440,Hood is not one of mine.
1441,
1442,DOCTOR: Of
1443,"course he is. He's a robot, created by your mechanical mates."
1444,
1445,SHERIFF: Why
1446,would they do that?
1447,
1448,DOCTOR: To
1449,"pacify the locals, give them false hope. He's the opiate of the"
1450,masses.
1451,
1452,SHERIFF: Why
1453,would we create an enemy to fight us? What sense would that make?
1454,That would be a terrible idea.
1455,
1456,DOCTOR: Yes!
1457,"Yes, it would. Wouldn't it? Yes, that would be a rubbish idea. Why"
1458,would you do that? But he can't be. He's not real. He's a legend!
1459,ROBIN: Too
1460,kind! And this legend does not come alone.
1461,(Robin is up in the gallery.)
1462,CLARA: Hiya!
1463,
1464,(Robin sticks his dagger into a wall hanging and slides down with Clara
1465,holding on to him.)
1466,ROBIN: You all right?
1467,
1468,"CLARA: Hell, yeah."
1469,
1470,ROBIN: Good.
1471,My men have taken the castle. 
1472,SHERIFF: No! 
1473,ROBIN: Now I'm
1474,going to take you.
1475,
1476,SHERIFF: This
1477,one's all mine.
1478,
1479,(The two knights guarding the Sheriff are deactivated by the amulet
1480,hanging around his neck.)
1481,SHERIFF: What do
1482,"you say, outlaw? A final reckoning?"
1483,
1484,"ROBIN: Oh, yes."
1485,
1486,(Robin and the Sheriff prepare to sword-fight.)
1487,DOCTOR: Are you okay?
1488,
1489,"CLARA: Fine, yeah."
1490,
1491,DOCTOR: Good. We don't have long.
1492,
1493,(The keep is rumbling and shaking.)
1494,SHERIFF: I shall
1495,"avenge every slight, outlaw."
1496,CLARA: Doctor
1497,DOCTOR: I know. The whole castle's about to blow.
1498,
1499,SHERIFF: You have
1500,long been a thorn in my side.
1501,
1502,"ROBIN: Well,"
1503,everyone should have a hobby. Mine's annoying you.
1504,
1505,SHERIFF: I'll
1506,have you boiled in oil at the castle by sunset.
1507,
1508,ROBIN: Can we
1509,make it a little earlier? Cos that's a little past my bedtime.
1510,(Robin cuts a rope and flies on it up to a cross-beam.)
1511,SHERIFF: I'm too
1512,"much for you, outlaw. The first of a new breed. Half man, half"
1513,engine.
1514,(The Sheriff also does the rope thing and they continue the fight up on
1515,the beam.)
1516,SHERIFF: Never
1517,ageing. Never tiring.
1518,ROBIN: Are you
1519,still talking?
1520,
1521,(The Sheriff cuts Robin's arm and he drops his sword. Then he opens his
1522,arms just like the Doctor did at the stream.)
1523,SHERIFF: Bow down
1524,"before your new king, you prince of knaves!"
1525,
1526,"(The Sheriff comes at Robin, who turns so they are back to back then"
1527,kicks the back of the Sheriff's knee.)
1528,SHERIFF: Argh!
1529,
1530,(The Sheriff falls into the crucible. Robin descends to the ground by
1531,rope again.)
1532,"ROBIN: Sorry. Was that, er, was that showing off?"
1533,
1534,CLARA: That was amazing.
1535,
1536,(The castle shakes. Masonry starts to fall.)
1537,"DOCTOR: Run! Come on, run!"
1538,
1539,(We leave a pair of gold-covered hands sticking out of the crucible.)
1540,
1541,[Castle grounds]
1542,
1543,"(From across the moat, we watch masonry fall and the"
1544,spaceship take off.)
1545,DOCTOR: It's never going to make it. Not enough gold. It'll
1546,never make it into
1547,orbit. Where is it? Where did it go?
1548,
1549,CLARA: Where did what go?
1550,
1551,DOCTOR: The
1552,golden arrow.
1553,ROBIN: Tuck!
1554,
1555,DOCTOR: You took it?
1556,
1557,TUCK: Of course we did. We're robbers.
1558,
1559,DOCTORY: I love you boys.
1560,
1561,"CLARA: Doctor, what are you suggesting?"
1562,
1563,DOCTOR: Golden
1564,arrow.
1565,It might just be enough gold content to get the ship into orbit and out
1566,of harm's way.
1567,
1568,(The Doctor offers Robin the bow and arrow.)
1569,"ROBIN: No, it has to be you. My arm"
1570,is injured.
1571,
1572,(But the Doctor can't even get the arrow onto the bowstring.)
1573,CLARA: You're good at this. I saw you. You won the tournament.
1574,DOCTOR: I
1575,cheated. I made a special arrow with a homing device.
1576,
1577,"CLARA: Oh,"
1578,"brilliant. Right, let me have a go."
1579,
1580,DOCTOR: You? You
1581,do Tae Kwon Do. That's not the same thing as this.
1582,ROBIN: My
1583,friends. Surely we can manage it together?
1584,
1585,
1586,[Spaceship]
1587,
1588,KNIGHT: Engine capacity at eighty three percent. Insufficient power to
1589,achieve escape velocity.
1590,
1591,"(Sitting on the ground, the Doctor and Clara hold each end of the"
1592,bow while Robin braces it with his foot. He pulls back the bowstring
1593,and releases the golden arrow. It hits the spaceship directly in the
1594,middle of a roundel on an engine.)
1595,KNIGHT: Maximum power surge.
1596,
1597,(The spaceship blasts into orbit.)
1598,KNIGHT: Engines critical. Engines critical. Engines crit 
1599,
1600,[Castle grounds]
1601,
1602,(KaBOOM! The watching crowd cheers.) 
1603,"ALAN: (sings) One awful day in Nottingham, Brave"
1604,Robin Hood was in a jam. The
1605,arrow flew it true 
1606,(His lute is snatched from him.)
1607,"WILL: Give it a rest, Alan."
1608,
1609,ALAN: Give me my lute!
1610,
1611,CLARA: Still not keen on the laughing thing?
1612,
1613,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no."
1614,
1615,(Clara laughs. Robin laughs.)
1616,
1617,[By a stream]
1618,
1619,(Robin gives Clara a very personal archery lesson.)
1620,CLARA: Woo-hoo! I'm going to miss you.
1621,You're very naughty.
1622,
1623,"ROBIN: Oh, I"
1624,know.
1625,"Whoever he is, he is a very lucky man."
1626,
1627,CLARA: Marian
1628,"is very lucky, too."
1629,
1630,ROBIN: I fear
1631,not.
1632,
1633,CLARA: Don't
1634,give up. Not ever. Not for one single day. 
1635,(She kisses his cheek.)
1636,"CLARA: Be safe, if you can"
1637,be. But always be amazing.
1638,
1639,ROBIN: Hmm. 
1640,"CLARA: Goodbye, Robin Hood."
1641,
1642,"ROBIN: Goodbye,"
1643,Clara Oswald.
1644,
1645,"(Clara winks at him, then goes into the Tardis.)"
1646,"ROBIN: So, is"
1647,"it true, Doctor?"
1648,
1649,DOCTOR: Is what
1650,true?
1651,
1652,ROBIN: That in
1653,the future I am forgotten as a real man? I am but a legend?
1654,
1655,DOCTOR: I'm
1656,afraid it is.
1657,
1658,ROBIN: Hmm.
1659,Good. History is a burden. Stories can make us fly.
1660,
1661,DOCTOR: I'm
1662,"still having a little trouble believing yours, I'm afraid."
1663,
1664,ROBIN: Is it so
1665,hard to credit? That a man born into wealth and privilege
1666,should find the plight of the oppressed and weak too much to bear...
1667,
1668,DOCTOR: No. 
1669,ROBIN: Until
1670,"one night he is moved to steal a Tardis? Fly among the stars,"
1671,fighting the good fight. Clara told me your stories.
1672,
1673,DOCTOR: She
1674,should not have told you any of that.
1675,
1676,ROBIN: Well.
1677,"Well, once the story started, she could hardly stop herself."
1678,"You are her hero, I think."
1679,
1680,DOCTOR: I'm not
1681,a hero.
1682,
1683,"ROBIN: Well,"
1684,neither am I. But if we both keep pretending to be. Ha-ha! Perhaps
1685,others will be heroes in our name. Perhaps we will both be
1686,stories. And may those stories never end. 
1687,(They shake hands.) 
1688,"ROBIN: Goodbye, Doctor, Time Lord of"
1689,Gallifrey.

1708,((Robin looks at a woman's portrait
1709,"in a locket around his neck, as the Tardis dematerialises to reveal"
