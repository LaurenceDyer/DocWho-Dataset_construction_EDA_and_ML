21,"DORIUM: Gentlemen, good news. My agents have procured the exact security software that you requested. The very latest upgrade. "
22,"I extracted it from the memory of a Judoon trooper. Well, I say extracted. It was quicker to take the whole brain. And to be honest, I don't "
23,think he's going to miss it.
24,(A cloaked figure holds out its hand for the small box.)
25,"DORIUM: Ah, ah, ah. A small matter of payment, I think."
26,"(A pouch is held out, and he snatches it.)"
27,"DORIUM: Delightful. Oh, I do enjoy sentient money, the way it wriggles. You'll find it in the frontal lobe. Should be quite easy, there's not a lot in there. "
28,"But all this to imprison one child? Oh, I know what you're up to. I hear everything in this place. I even hear rumours about whose child you've taken. "
29,"Are you mad? You know the stories about the Doctor, the things that man has done. God help us if you make him angry."

35,"habitation, a baby has been born. Her name is Melody Pond.) "
36,"AMY: I wish I could tell you that you'll be loved, that you'll be safe"
37,and cared for and protected. But this isn't a time for lies. What you
38,"are going to be, Melody is very, very brave. "
39,(The Eye Patch Lady steps forward from the line of armed guards.) 
40,KOVARIAN: Two minutes. 
41,AMY: But not as brave as they'll have to be. Because there's someone
42,"coming. I don't know where he is, or what he's doing, but trust me,"
43,he's on his way.

71,"AMY: He's the last of his kind. He looks young, but he's lived for"

87,RORY: I have a message and a question. A message from the Doctor and a
88,"question from me. Where is my wife? Oh, don't give me those blank"
89,looks. The Twelfth Cyber Legion monitors this entire quadrant. You hear
90,"everything. So you tell me what I need to know. You tell me now, and"
91,I'll be on my way.

98,(Two Cleric soldiers are walking along.) 
99,LUCAS: A whole Cyber Legion though. He just blew them all up to make a
100,point. 
101,"DOMINICUS: We're being paid to fight him, not praise him. Praising"

119,DOMINICUS: She's on a break. She can do what she likes. Now try again. 
120,(He holds up two pieces of paper.) 
121,LUCAS: That one. 
122,"DOMINICUS: No, that's the psychic. You've got to look for the fractals."

131,FAT ONE: You're not supposed to stare at them. And if they think you're
132,"trying to see under their hoods, they'll kill you on the spot. "
133,THIN ONE: But why are they called the Headless Monks? They can't really
134,be headless? 
135,"LORNA: They believe the domain of faith is the heart, and the domain of"
136,"doubt is the head. They follow their hearts, that's all. "
137,"THIN ONE: You're Lorna Bucket, aren't you? "
138,LORNA: Yeah. 
139,THIN ONE: Hello. I'm the Thin One. This is my husband. He's the Fat
140,One. 
141,LORNA: Don't you have names? 
142,FAT ONE: We're the thin fat gay married Anglican marines. Why would we
143,need names as well? 
144,(Three Headless Monks are 'looking' at them.) 
145,"FAT ONE: Oh, looks like I'm off. Time for my conversion tutorial. See"
146,you in a bit. Do you lot have
147,Lent? Because I'm not good at giving things up. 
148,(The Fat One leaves with the Monks.) 
149,"THIN ONE: Lorna Bucket. You've had an Encounter, haven't you? You've"
150,met him. 
151,LORNA: I was just a kid. 
152,THIN ONE: But what's he like? The Doctor. 
153,LORNA: He said run. 
154,THIN ONE: Just run? 
155,LORNA: He said it a lot. 
156,"THIN ONE: And this was in the Gamma Forests, yeah? Because you're a"
157,"Gamma girl, aren't you? What are you doing here? The Forests are heaven"

162,
163,(Red light.) 
164,"FAT ONE: Oh, this is nice, I like this. I mean, quite a lot of red. I"
165,hope it's not to hide the stains. What's in the little boxes? 
166,"VOICE : Welcome, applicant, to the order of the Headless. It is"
167,traditional for visiting armies of other faiths to offer individuals
168,for conversion to our order. You have been selected. Are you ready to
169,make a donation? 
170,(A Monk brings forward an empty box.)
171,
172,[Corridor]
173,
174,"THIN ONE: So, what do you think? If the Doctor's"
175,"really coming here, where is he? "
176,LORNA: He's the Doctor. He could be anywhere in time and space.

184,"PARKER: Yus, my lady. "
185,[Vastra's home]
186,
187,(The lady goes into her house and is greeted by her
188,maid.) 
189,"JENNY: You're back early, ma'am. Another case cracked, I assume? "
190,(The mysterious lady puts a Samuri sword back on its stand.) 
191,VASTRA: Send a telegram to Inspector Abberline of the yard. Jack the
192,Ripper has claimed his last victim. 
193,JENNY: How did you find him? 
194,(The lady throws back her hood to reveal that she is a Silurian.) 
195,"VASTRA: Stringy, but tasty all the same. I shan't be needing dinner. "
196,"JENNY: Congratulations, ma'am. However, a matter has arisen in the"
197,drawing room. 
198,[Drawing room]
199,
200,JENNY: It just appeared. What does it mean? 
201,VASTRA: It means a very old debt is to be repaid. 
202,(It is the Tardis.) 
203,"VASTRA: Pack the cases, Jenny. And we're going to need the swords."
204,
205,"[The Battle of Zaruthstra, 4037 A.D.]"

207,"HARCOURT: Nurse! Nurse! Damn it, where's the nurse!"
208,
209,ELEANOR: He needs help. 
210,"HARCOURT: Madame President, I'm sorry, but we have to go now! Those"
211,things could be here any second. 
212,(A little boy is lying on a bed in the tent. He is very still. A
213,Sontaran warrior enters.) 
214,STRAX: Did somebody call for a nurse? 
215,(Strax tends to the boy.) 
216,ARTHUR: Will I be okay? 
217,"STRAX: Of course you will, my boy. You'll be up and around in no time."
218,"And perhaps one day, you and I shall meet on the field of battle, and I"
219,will destroy you for the glory of the Sontaran Empire. 
220,"ARTHUR: Thanks, Nurse. "
221,"(Strax leaves, and Harcourt follows him.) "
222,HARCOURT: Commander Strax. I just have to ask. A Sontaran nurse? 
223,STRAX: I serve a penance to restore the honour of my clone batch. It is
224,"the greatest punishment a Sontaran can endure, to help the weak and"
225,sick. 
226,HARCOURT: Who came up with that one? 
227,(The sound of the Tardis materialising.) 
228,"STRAX: Tonight, though, perhaps my penance is over. Captain Harcourt, I"
229,"hope some day to meet you in the glory of battle, when I shall crush"

234,(River Song is returning from a Regency era Frost
235,"Fair, by the looks of her clothes. The alarms are blaring. She picks up"
236,the guard's phone.) 
237,"RIVER: Oh, turn it off. I'm breaking in, not out. This is River Song,"
238,"back in her cell. Oh, and I'll take breakfast at the usual time. Thank"
239,you. 
240,(She sees a figure standing in the corridor.) 
241,"RIVER: Oh, are you boys dressing up as Romans now? I thought nobody"
242,read my memos. 
243,"RORY: Doctor Song. It's Rory. Sorry, have we met yet? Time streams. I'm"
244,not quite sure where we are. 
245,"RIVER: Yes. Yes, we've met. Hello, Rory. "
246,RORY: What's wrong? 
247,RIVER: It's my birthday. The Doctor took me ice skating on the River
248,"Thames in 1814, the last of the great Frost Fairs. He got Stevie Wonder"
249,to sing for me under London Bridge. 
250,RORY: Stevie Wonder sang in 1814? 
251,"RIVER: Yes, he did. But you must never tell him. "
252,RORY: I've come from the Doctor too. 
253,"RIVER: Yes, but at a different point in time. "
254,RORY: Unless there's two of them. 
255,"RIVER: Now, that's a whole different birthday. "
256,RORY: He needs you. 
257,(River checks her diary.) 
258,RIVER: Demon's Run. 
259,"RORY: How, how did you know? "
260,RIVER: I'm from his future. I always know. Why on Earth are you wearing
261,that? 
262,RORY: The Doctor's idea. 
263,"RIVER: Of course. His rules of engagement. Float like a butterfly,"
264,sting like a bee. 
265,RORY: Look ridiculous. 
266,RIVER: Have you considered heels? 
267,RORY: They've taken Amy. And our baby. The Doctor's getting some people
268,"together. We're going after her, but he needs you, too. "
269,"RIVER: I can't. Not yet, anyway. "
270,RORY: I'm sorry? 
271,RIVER: This is the Battle of Demon's Run. The Doctor's darkest hour.
272,"He'll rise higher than ever before and then fall so much further, and I"
273,can't be with him till the very end. 
274,RORY: Why not? 
275,RIVER: Because this is it. This is the day he finds out who I am.

278,
279,(A large blue skinned alien is packing a small
280,case.) 
281,DORIUM: Goodbye. 
282,"KOVARIAN: You appear to be closing down, Dorium. What have you heard? "
283,"DORIUM: That you pricked the side of a mighty beast, Madame Kovarian,"
284,and entirely failed to run. I admire your courage. I should like to
285,admire it from afar. 
286,KOVARIAN: We've been waiting a month. He's done nothing. 
287,DORIUM: Do you really think so? There are people all over this galaxy
288,"that owe that man a debt. By now, a few of them will have found a blue"
289,"box waiting for them on their doorstep, poor devils. "
290,MANTON: You think he's raising an army? 
291,DORIUM: You think he isn't? If that man is finally collecting on his
292,"debts, God help you, and God help his debtors. "
293,MANTON: Why? 
294,"DORIUM: Colonel Manton, all those stories you've heard about him,"
295,"they're not stories, they're true. Really. You're not telling me you"
296,don't know what's coming? 
297,MANTON: We're wasting our time here. 
298,KOVARIAN: Agreed. 
299,"DORIUM: The asteroid, where you've made your base. Do you know why they"
300,call it Demon's Run? 
301,MANTON: How do you know the location of our base? 
302,DORIUM: You're with the Headless Monks. They're old customers of mine. 
303,KOVARIAN: It's just some old saying. 
304,DORIUM: A very old saying. The oldest. Demons run when a good man goes
305,to war. 
306,(Kovarian and Manton leave. Dorium is about to leave when the Tardis
307,sound is heard.) 
308,"DORIUM: No. No, no, please. Not me. You don't need me. Why would you"

312,
313,(Colonel Manton addresses his assembled troops.) 
314,"MANTON: He is not the devil. He is not a god. He is not a goblin, or a"
315,"phantom or a trickster. The Doctor is a living, breathing man, and as I"
316,look around this room I know one thing. We're sure as hell going to fix
317,that. 
318,(The troops cheer.) 
319,[White room]
320,
321,(Amy is watching the rally from her window. Lorna
322,enters.) 
323,LORNA: Sorry. I shouldn't be here. I'm meant to be at the thing. I
324,brought you something. Your child's name in the language of my people.
325,"It's a prayer leaf and we believe, if you keep this with you, your"
326,child will always come home to you. 
327,(It is what she was sewing earlier.) 
328,AMY: Can I borrow your gun? 
329,LORNA: Why? 
330,AMY: Because I've got a feeling you're going to keep talking. 
331,(She turns back to the window.) 
332,AMY: They're talking like he's famous. The Doctor isn't famous. 
333,LORNA: He meets a lot of people. Some of them remember. He's sort of
334,"like a, I don't"
335,"know, a dark legend. "
336,AMY: Dark? Have you met him? 
337,LORNA: Yeah. But I was just a little girl. 
338,AMY: So was I. 
339,"LORNA: You've been with him a long time, then. "
340,AMY: No. He came back for me. 
341,LORNA: You must be very special. 
342,"AMY: Hey. You can wait a long time for the Doctor, but he's worth it,"
343,"okay? The thing is, he's coming. No question about it. Just you make"
344,"sure you're on the right side when he gets here. Not for my sake, for"
345,yours. 
346,(Amy takes the prayer leaf.) 
347,AMY: Thank you.

350,
351,"MANTON: On this day, in this place, the Doctor will"
352,fall. 
353,ALL: Hoo Rah! 
354,"MANTON: The man who talks, the man who reasons, the man who lies, will"
355,meet the perfect answer. 
356,ALL Hoo Rah! 
357,MANTON; Some of you have wondered why have we have allied ourselves
358,with the Headless Monks. Perhaps you should have wondered why we call
359,them Headless. It's time you knew what these guys have sacrificed for
360,"faith. As you all know, it is a Level One Heresy, punishable by death,"
361,to lower the hood of a Headless Monk. But by the divine grant of the
362,"Papal Mainframe herself, on this one and only occasion, I can show you"
363,the truth. Because these guys never can be persuaded. 
364,"(Colonel Manton lowers one Monk's hood. It has no head, just the skin"
365,of the neck tied off..) 
366,MANTON: They never can be afraid. 
367,(A second hood lowered.)

381,
382,[Demon's Run]
383,
384,"MANTON: Doctor, you will come with me right now. "
385,DOCTOR: Three minutes forty seconds. Amelia Pond! Get your coat! 
386,(The lights go out for a few seconds.) 
387,DOCTOR : I'm not a phantom. 
388,MANTON: Doctor? 
389,DOCTOR : I'm not a trick. 
390,MANTON: Doctor? 
391,DOCTOR : I'm a monk. 
392,"MANTON: Doctor, show yourself. "
393,MAN: It's him! He's here! It's him!

423,
424,[Demon's Run]
425,
426,MANTON: Stop. Wait. Listen to me. I am disarming my
427,"weapon pack. Monks, I do this in good faith. I am now unarmed. All of"
428,"you, discharge your weapon packs. The Doctor is trying to make fools of"
429,us. We are soldiers of God. We are not fools. We are not fools. We are
430,not fools. We are not fools.

453,got incoming.

489,"STRAX: Colonel Manton, you will give the order for your men to"
490,withdraw. 
491,"DOCTOR: No. Colonel Manton, I want you to tell your men to run away. "
492,MANTON: You what? 
493,DOCTOR: Those words. Run away. I want you to be famous for those exact
494,words. I want people to call you Colonel Run Away. I want children
495,"laughing outside your door, because they've found the house of Colonel"
496,"Run Away. And, when people come to you, and ask if trying to get to me"
497,"through the people I love is in any way a good idea, I want you to tell"
498,"them your name. Oh, look, I'm angry. That's new. I'm really not sure"
499,what's going to happen now. 
500,KOVARIAN: The anger of a good man is not a problem. Good men have too
501,many rules. 
502,DOCTOR: Good men don't need rules. Today is not the day to find out why
503,I have so many. 
504,"KOVARIAN: Give the order. Give the order, Colonel Run Away."

507,
508,(Someone is hammering at the door. Amy rummages in
509,a drawer and finds what might be an electric toothbrush.) 
510,"AMY: Who's that? Who's there? You watch it, because I'm armed and"
511,"really dangerous, and cross. "
512,"RORY : Yeah, like I don't know that. "
513,"AMY: Rory? Rory, is that you. "
514,"RORY : Yeah, it's me. Look, hang on a minute. "
515,(It sounds like Rory is trying to sonic his way in.) 
516,"AMY: They took her. Rory, they took our baby away. "
517,(The door opens. Rory is carrying Melody.) 
518,"RORY: Now, Mrs Williams, that is never, ever going to happen. "
519,"AMY: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Where's she been? What have they done to"
520,her? 
521,"RORY: She's fine. Amy, she's fine. I checked. She's beautiful. Oh God,"
522,I was going to be cool. I wanted to be cool. Look at me. 
523,"AMY: You're okay. Crying Roman with a baby. Definitely cool. Come here,"
524,you. 
525,"DOCTOR: Urgh. Kissing and crying. I'll, I'll be back in a bit. "
526,"RORY: Oi, you. Get in here, now. My daughter. What do you think? "
527,"DOCTOR: Hello. Hello, baby. "
528,AMY: Melody. 
529,"DOCTOR: Melody? Hello, Melody Pond. "
530,RORY: Melody Williams. 
531,AMY: Is a geography teacher. Melody Pond is a superhero. 
532,"DOCTOR: Well yes, I suppose she does smell nice. Never really sniffed"
533,"her. Maybe I should give it a go. Amelia Pond, come here. "
534,AMY: Doctor. 
535,DOCTOR: I'm sorry we were so long. 
536,AMY: It's okay. I knew you were coming. Both of you. My boys. 
537,"DOCTOR: It's okay. She's still all yours. And really, you should call"
538,"her mummy, not big milk thing. "
539,"AMY: Okay, what are you doing? "
540,DOCTOR: I speak Baby. 
541,"AMY: No, you don't. "
542,"DOCTOR: I speak everything, don't I, Melody Pond. No, it's not. it's"
543,cool. 
544,VASTRA: Doctor? Take a look. They're leaving. Demon's Run is ours
545,"without a drop of blood spilled. My friend, you have never risen"
546,higher.
547,
548,[Outside the Tardis]
549,
550,(Amy carried Melody out of the Tardis.) 
551,"RORY: Hey, what's wrong? "
552,AMY: She doesn't like the Tardis noise. I asked him to turn something
553,"off, but it was all, but I don't want to punch a hole in the space-time"
554,continuum. Shush. 
555,JENNY: Rory! The Judoon have escorted the Clerics out of the quadrant.
556,Spitfires have returned to their own time. Captain Avery and his men
557,are going. Is she all right? 
558,"AMY: Yes, she's just crying. "
559,"STRAX: Give her to me, human fool. She needs changing. "
560,AMY: I just changed her. I think she might need a feed. 
561,"STRAX: A feed, of course. I'll take care of everything. "
562,"RORY: Er, I really don't think you will, actually. "
563,STRAX: I have gene-spliced myself for all nursing duties. I can produce
564,magnificent quantities of lactic fluid. 
565,(The Doctor comes out of the Tardis with a wooden cot that has an
566,orrary dangling over it.) 
567,"DOCTOR: She's not hungry, she's tired. Sorry, Melody, they're just not"
568,listening. 
569,AMY: What's this? 
570,"DOCTOR: Very pretty, according to your daughter. "
571,"RORY: It's a, it's a cot. "
572,DOCTOR: No flies on the Roman. Give her here. 
573,"AMY: Hey, there we go. "
574,RORY: But where would you get a cot? 
575,"AMY: It's old. Really old. Doctor, er, do you have children? "
576,DOCTOR: No. 
577,AMY: Have you ever had children? 
578,"DOCTOR: No, it's real. It's my hair. "
579,AMY: Who slept in here? 
580,"VASTRA : Doctor, we need you in the main control room. "
581,DOCTOR: Be right there! Things to do. I've still got to work out what
582,this base is for. We can't leave till we know. 
583,AMY: But this is where I was? The whole time I thought I was on the
584,"Tardis, I was really here? "
585,"DOCTOR: Er, Centurian, permission to hug? "
586,"RORY: Be aware, I do have a sword. "
587,"DOCTOR: At all times. You were on the Tardis, too. Your heart, your"
588,"mind, your soul. But physically, yes, you were still in this place. "
589,"AMY: And when I saw that face looking through the hatch, that woman"
590,looking at me. 
591,DOCTOR: Reality bleeding through. They must have taken you quite a
592,while back. Just before America. 
593,RORY: That's probably enough hugging now. So her Flesh avatar was with
594,us all that time. But that means they were projecting a control signal
595,right into the Tardis wherever we were in time and space. 
596,"DOCTOR: Yeah, they're very clever. "
597,AMY: Who are? 
598,RORY: Whoever wants our baby. 
599,AMY: But why do they want her? 
600,DOCTOR: Exactly. 
601,RORY: Is there anything you're not telling us? You knew Amy wasn't
602,real. You never said. 
603,"DOCTOR: Well, I couldn't be sure they weren't listening. "
604,"AMY: But you always hold out on us. Please, not this time. Doctor, it's"
605,our baby. Tell us something. One little thing. 
606,DOCTOR: It's mine. 
607,RORY: What is? 
608,DOCTOR: The cot. It's my cot. I slept in there. 
609,"AMY: Oh, my God. It's the Doctor's first stars. "
610,RORY: She's 
611,(Amy wipes Melody's dribble with the prayer leaf.) 
612,STRAX: Drop your weapons. State your rank and intent. I found it
613,listening at the door. 
614,(It is Lorna.)
615,
616,[Control room]
617,
618,"DOCTOR: You've hacked into their software, then? "
619,DORIUM: I believe I sold it to them. 
620,DOCTOR: Ooo. So what have we learned? 
621,VASTRA: That anger is always the shortest distance to a mistake. 
622,DOCTOR: I'm sorry? 
623,VASTRA: The words of an old friend who once found me in the London
624,"Underground, attempting to avenge my sisters on perfectly innocent"
625,tunnel diggers. 
626,"DOCTOR: Well, you were very cross at the time. "
627,"VASTRA: As you were today, old friend. Point taken, I hope. Now, I have"
628,a question. A simple one. Is Melody human? 
629,"DOCTOR: Sorry, what? Of course she is. Completely human. What are you"
630,talking about? 
631,"DORIUM: They've been scanning her since she was born, and I think they"
632,found what they were looking for. 
633,DOCTOR: Human DNA. 
634,"VASTRA: Look closer. Human plus. Specifically, human plus Time Lord."
635,
636,[Outside the Tardis]
637,
638,LORNA: I heard her talking. This is a trap. Why
639,would I lie to you? 
640,"RORY: Well, you might want to take a look at your uniform. "
641,LORNA: The only reason I joined the Clerics was so I could meet the
642,Doctor again. 
643,"JENNY: You wanted to meet him, so you joined an army to fight him? "
644,"LORNA: Well, how else do you meet a great warrior? "
645,AMY: He's not a warrior. 
646,LORNA: Then why is he called the Doctor? 
647,(The lights go out.) 
648,"LORNA: It's starting. Please, listen to me."
649,
650,[Control room]
651,
652,DOCTOR: But she's human. She's Amy and Rory's
653,daughter. 
654,VASTRA: You've told me about your people. They became what they did
655,through prolonged exposure to the time vortex. The Untempered Schism. 
656,DOCTOR: Over billions of years. It didn't just happen. 
657,VASTRA: So how close is she? Could she even regenerate? 
658,"DOCTOR: No, no. I don't think so. "
659,VASTRA: You don't sound so sure. 
660,DOCTOR: Because I don't understand how this happened. 
661,VASTRA: Which leads me to ask when did it happen? 
662,DOCTOR: When? 
663,VASTRA: I am trying to be delicate. I know how you can blush. When did
664,this baby begin? 
665,"DOCTOR: Oh, you mean "
666,VASTRA: Quite. 
667,"DOCTOR: Well, how would I know? That's all human-y, private stuff. It"
668,"just sort of goes on. They don't put up a balloon, or anything. "
669,"VASTRA: But could the child have begun on the Tardis in flight, in the"
670,vortex. 
671,"DOCTOR: No! No! Impossible! It's all running about, sexy fish vampires"
672,and blowing up stuff. And Rory wasn't even there at the beginning. Then
673,"he was dead, then he didn't exist, then he was plastic. Then I had to"
674,"reboot the whole universe. Long story. So, technically the first time"
675,"they were on the Tardis together in this version of reality, was on"
676,their w 
677,VASTRA: On their what? 
678,DOCTOR: On their wedding night.
679,
680,[Outside the Tardis]
681,
682,STRAX: Confirmed. No life forms registering on this
683,"base, except us and the Silurians. "
684,LORNA: The Headless Monks aren't alive. They don't register as life
685,forms. 
686,(And one is creeping up on a Silurian warrior.)
687,
688,[Control room]
689,
690,DOCTOR: It doesn't make sense. You can't just cook
691,yourself a Time Lord. 
692,"VASTRA: Of course not. But you gave them one hell of a start, and"
693,they've been working very hard ever since. 
694,DORIUM: And yet they gave in so easily. Does this not that bother
695,anyone else? 
696,DOCTOR: Amy. She worried the baby would have a time head. She said that
697,
698,VASTRA: Only you would ignore the instincts of a mother. 
699,DORIUM: Or the instincts of a coward. This is too easy. There's
700,something wrong. 
701,DOCTOR: Why even do it? Even if you could get your hands on a brand new
702,"Time Lord, what for? "
703,VASTRA: A weapon? 
704,DOCTOR: Why would a Time Lord be a weapon? 
705,"VASTRA: Well, they've seen you. "
706,DOCTOR: Me? 
707,"VASTRA: Mister Maldovar, you're right. This was too easy. We should get"
708,back to the others. 
709,(Vastra and Dorium leave.) 
710,DOCTOR: Me? 
711,(The Doctor thinks back to the warehouse in 1969.) 
712,"RIVER [memory]: I'd say she's human, going by the life-support"
713,"software. She climbed out of the suit, like she forced her way out. She"
714,must be incredibly strong. 
715,KOVARIAN [on screen]: I see you accessed our files. Do you understand
716,"yet? Oh, don't worry, I'm a long way away. But I like to keep tabs on"
717,"you. The child, then. What do you think? "
718,DOCTOR: What is she? 
719,"KOVARIAN [on screen]: Hope. Hope in this endless, bitter war. "
720,DOCTOR: What war? Against who? 
721,"KOVARIAN [on screen]: Against you, Doctor."
722,
723,[Outside the Tardis]
724,
725,(The Monks are on the move. A white light cone
726,appears around the Tardis.) 
727,AMY: What's that? 
728,VASTRA: A force field. 
729,LORNA: And those are the doors locking. 
730,VASTRA: Apparently we're not leaving. 
731,RORY: Is that the Monks? 
732,"DORIUM: Oh, dear God. That's the attack prayer. "
733,"RORY: Quick, come with me. "
734,VASTRA: Commander Strax! 
735,STRAX: I'm trying to seal off this area of the lighting grid. 
736,VASTRA: This is where we'll make our stand. Clear lines of sight on all
737,approaches. 
738,(Rory hides Amy and Melody behind some boxes.) 
739,"AMY: Rory, no offence to the others, but you let them all die first,"
740,okay? 
741,RORY: You're so Scottish. 
742,"VASTRA: Centurian, you're needed! "
743,LORNA: There should be some plasma pistols somewhere. They left
744,everything. 
745,"STRAX: Then find them, boy! "
746,VASTRA: She's definitely a girl. 
747,"JENNY: Oh, stop it! "
748,DORIUM: We don't have to fight them. I'm friends to the Monks. They
749,know me. 
750,"RORY: Yeah, and they know you just sold them out to the Doctor. "
751,"DORIUM: Oh, they'll understand it's only me. Only silly old me. You"
752,"understand, don't you? "
753,"VASTRA: Mister Maldovar, get back here! "
754,"STRAX: Arm yourself, fool! "
755,RORY: Dorium! 
756,"(Dorium walks into the darkness, arms outstretched. There is a swish of"
757,"metal, and something falls to the floor.) "
758,VASTRA: Mister Maldovar? 
759,RORY: Dorium? 
760,(Two Monks escort the headless Dorium back into view.) 
761,"VASTRA: The child. At all costs, protect the child!"
762,
763,[Control room]
764,
765,DOCTOR: A child is not a weapon! 
766,"KOVARIAN [on screen]: Oh, give us time. She can be. She will be. "
767,"DOCTOR: Except you've already lost her, and I swear I will never let"
768,you anywhere near her again. 
769,"KOVARIAN [on screen]: Oh, Doctor. Fooling you once was a joy, but"
770,fooling you twice the same way? It's a privilege. 
771,DOCTOR: Amy. Amy. 
772,[Outside the Tardis]
773,
774,(The fight is on as the Doctor runs. Madame
775,Kovarian appears through a hatch behind Amy.) 
776,RIVER : Demons run when a good man goes to war. Night will fall and
777,"drown the sun, when a good man goes to war. Friendship dies and true"
778,"love lies, night will fall and the dark will rise, when a good man goes"
779,to war. 
780,DOCTOR: Amy! 
781,"RIVER : Demons run but count the cost. The battle's won, but the"
782,child is lost. 
783,DOCTOR: Amy! 
784,"KOVARIAN: Wakey, wakey. "
785,DOCTOR: Amy! 
786,(Melody suddenly goes splat in Amy's arms.) 
787,AMY: Rory? Rory! Rory! 
788,(The Doctor is behind a locked door.) 
789,"DOCTOR: Amy, she's not real! Melody, she's a Flesh avatar. Amy! "
790,(The Doctor runs in. Everything is quiet.) 
791,DOCTOR: Amy! Amy. 
792,"RORY: Yeah, we know. "
793,"(The Monks are dead, and Strax is wounded.) "
794,STRAX: It's strange. I have often dreamed of dying in combat. I'm not
795,enjoying it as much as I'd hoped. 
796,"RORY: Come on, Strax. Don't give up. "
797,STRAX: It's all right. I've had a good life. I'm nearly twelve. 
798,RORY: Listen to me. You'll be back on your feet in no time. You're a
799,warrior. 
800,"STRAX: Rory, I'm a nurse. "
801,(The Doctor goes to where Jenny is comforting Amy.) 
802,AMY: So they took her anyway. All this was for nothing. 
803,DOCTOR: I am so sorry. 
804,"JENNY: Amy, it's not his fault. "
805,AMY: I know. I know. 
806,"VASTRA: Doctor, there's someone who wants to speak to you. Her name is"
807,Lorna. She came to warn us. 
808,(Lorna is also dying.) 
809,DOCTOR: Hey. Hello. 
810,LORNA: Doctor. 
811,DOCTOR: You helped my friends. Thank you. 
812,"LORNA: I met you once, in the Gamma Forests. You don't remember me. "
813,"DOCTOR: Hey, of course I remember. I remember everyone. Hey, we ran,"
814,"you and me. Didn't we run, Lorna? "
815,(Lorna dies.) 
816,DOCTOR: Who was she? 
817,"VASTRA: I don't know, but she was very brave. "
818,DOCTOR: They're always brave. They're always brave. 
819,"VASTRA: So, what now? They'd almost certainly have taken her to Earth."
820,Raise her in the correct environment. 
821,"DOCTOR: Yes, they did. And it's already too late. "
822,VASTRA: You're giving up? You never do that. 
823,"DOCTOR: Yeah, and don't you sometimes wish I did? "
824,(There is a flash of lightning.) 
825,"RIVER: Well then, soldier. How goes the day? "
826,"DOCTOR: Where the hell have you been? Every time you've asked, I have"
827,been there. Where the hell were you today? 
828,RIVER: I couldn't have prevented this. 
829,DOCTOR: You could have tried! 
830,"RIVER: And so, my love, could you. I know you're not all right. But"
831,"hold tight, Amy, because you're going to be. "
832,"DOCTOR: You think I wanted this? I didn't do this. This, this wasn't"
833,me! 
834,RIVER: This was exactly you. All this. All of it. You make them so
835,"afraid. When you began, all those years ago, sailing off to see the"
836,"universe, did you ever think you'd become this? The man who can turn an"
837,army around at the mention of his name. Doctor. The word for healer and
838,"wise man throughout the universe. We get that word from you, you know."
839,"But if you carry on the way you are, what might that word come to mean?"
840,"To the people of the Gamma Forests, the word Doctor means mighty"
841,"warrior. How far you've come. And now they've taken a child, the child"
842,"of your best friends, and they're going to turn her into a weapon just"
843,"to bring you down. And all this, my love, in fear of you. "
844,DOCTOR: Who are you? 
845,"RIVER: Oh look, your cot. Haven't seen that in a very long while. "
846,"DOCTOR: No, no, you tell me. Tell me who you are. "
847,RIVER: I am telling you. Can't you read? 
848,(The Old High Gallifreyan on the cot.) 
849,DOCTOR: Hello. 
850,RIVER: Hello. 
851,DOCTOR: But but that means 
852,RIVER: I'm afraid it does. 
853,"DOCTOR: Ooo. But you and I, we, we, we, er (kiss kiss) "
854,RIVER: Yes. 
855,(The Doctor is getting all excited with anticipation.) 
856,DOCTOR: How do I look? 
857,RIVER: Amazing. 
858,DOCTOR: I'd better be. 
859,"RIVER: Yes, you'd better be. "
860,"DOCTOR: Vastra and Jenny, till the next time. Rory and Amy, I know"
861,"where to find your daughter, and on my life, she will be safe. River,"
862,get them all home. 
863,RORY: Doctor! 
864,AMY: No! Where are you going? 
865,(The Doctor takes down the forcefield around the Tardis and goes
866,inside.) 
867,AMY: No! 
868,(The Tardis dematerialises.) 
869,AMY: Where's he going and what did you tell him? 
870,"RIVER: Amy, you have stay calm. "
871,(Amy picks up a gun.) 
872,AMY: Tell me what you told the Doctor. 
873,"RORY: Amy, no. Stop it! "
874,"RIVER: It's okay, Rory. She's fine. She's good. It's the Tardis"
875,translation matrix. It takes a while to kick in with the written word.
876,You have to concentrate. 
877,AMY: I still can't read it. 
878,RIVER: It's because it's Gallifreyan and doesn't translate. But this
879,will. 
880,(The prayer leaf.) 
881,RIVER: It's your daughter's name in the language of the Forest. 
882,AMY: I know my daughter's name. 
883,"RIVER: Except they don't have a word for Pond, because the only water"
884,"in the forest is the River. The Doctor will find your daughter, and he"
885,will care for her whatever it takes. And I know that. It's me. I'm
886,Melody. I'm your daughter.
