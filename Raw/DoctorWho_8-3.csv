21, [UNIT radar tracking]
22,
23, (An elegant golden spaceship is picked up on a
24,tracking dish.) 
25,"RADAR 1: Twenty five mps. One million miles. Mass, variable. "
26,"RADAR 2: Well, if that's its course, we've discovered a comet. Run"
27,another course check. 
28,RADAR 1: It's altered its course! 
29,RADAR 2: It can't have. 
30,"RADAR 1: Oh, yes it can, mate. You can say goodbye to your comet,"
31,"'because whatever that thing is, it's on collision course and heading"
32,straight for Earth. 
33,"(We get a close up at the approaching ship, with it's organic-looking"
34,"hull, leech-mouth-like bow, and tail-shaped stern. Inside, large"
35,lifeforms with lots of root-like appendages flail around.) 
36, [Brigadier's office] 
37, (A Civil Service type opens a file conveniently
38,"labelled Top Secret, then another. Other people are standing and"
39,sitting around the room.) 
40,CHINN: Nothing. Nothing at all. 
41,BRIGADIER: No. 
42,"CHINN: Brigadier, as head of this committee of enquiry, I must remind"
43,you of the Defence Ministry ruling. 
44,"BRIGADIER: Mister Chinn, as head of UNIT, I must remind you, that we're"
45,not in the Ministry of Defence. 
46,CHINN: All personnel must be properly screened 
47,CHINN + BRIGADIER: And scrupulously filed. 
48,"CHINN: As an elementary security precaution, I must insist upon a file"
49,"for this Doctor, er, what's-his-name. "
50,"BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, Mister Chinn. I am personally responsible for the"
51,Doctor. 
52,CHINN: Typical! Absolutely typical! That's the kind of high-handed
53,"attitude one's come to expect from the UN recently. Now, Brigadier,"
54,what about this Doctor? I gather he's not a British subject. Then who
55,is he and where does he come from? 
56,"(The Doctor enters, catching the pacing Chinn with the edge of a double"
57,door.) 
58,"DOCTOR: Good morning. Oh, good morning."
59,
60, [UNIT corridor]
61,
62, JO: I gather Washington thinks it's time the Master
63,was dealt with? 
64,FILER: (american) Something like that. 
65,JO: And you're going to deal with him single handed? 
66,"FILER: Yeah. No, no, that was Errol Flynn. "
67,JO: Who? 
68,FILER: Forget it. 
69,(Jo and Filer walk past a set of red orange and green lights on the
70,wall under a large number six. They all begin to flash.)
71,
72, [Brigadier's office]
73,
74," DOCTOR: My dear Mister Chinn, if I could leave, I"
75,"would, if only to get away from people like you. "
76,BRIGADIER: Doctor. 
77,DOCTOR: And your petty obsessions! England for the English! Good
78,"heavens, man! "
79,CHINN: I have a duty to my country! 
80,DOCTOR: Not to the world? 
81,(Jo and Filer enter.) 
82,"JO: Good morning. Oh, I'm sorry. Has the conference started? "
83,"BRIGADIER: No, not yet. "
84,JO: This is Bill Filer from Washington HQ.
85,
86, [UNIT corridor]
87,
88, (The lights are still flashing but nobody is
89,paying attention.) 
90,YATES: What is it? Do you know? 
91,"BENTON: No idea, sir."
92,
93, [Brigadier's office]
94,
95, DOCTOR: There's no point in discussing the Master.
96,"I keep telling you, he's left Earth by now. "
97,"BRIGADIER: We can't be certain of that, Doctor. We must keep on"
98,looking. 
99,CHINN: Master? Who is the Master? 
100,"FILER: I, er, I have a report here, Brigadier. It's classified I'm"
101,"afraid, sir. "
102,CHINN: Then I must insist upon staying. 
103,"FILER: I'm sorry, sir. You have no clearance. "
104,"CHINN: On the contrary, for the duration of this enquiry, I've been"
105,guaranteed full access to 
106,"FILER: Not by us, sir. "
107,CHINN: This has nothing to do with Washington! 
108,"FILER: I'm sorry, sir. You are a security risk. "
109,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, er "
110,(An alarm bell rings and red and green lights mounted by the door
111,flash. Yates enters.) 
112,"YATES: UFO, sir, coming in fast."
113,
114, [UNIT radar tracking]
115,
116, RADAR 2: UFO bearing two zero niner. Five hundred
117,miles and closing.Â 
118,"BENTON: ITS, sir, report sightings confirmed. "
119,RADAR 2: Velocity twenty mps 
120,BENTON: Houston HAL tracking. 
121,RADAR 2: Decreasing. 
122,BENTON: Hawaii HAL tracking. 
123,"(Yates, the Brigadier, Chinn and the Doctor enter.) "
124,"YATES: What the picture here, lads? "
125,"BENTON: Negative on astro. We're running ICBM checks, sir. "
126,"CHINN: ICBM? What ICBM? Brigadier, what's going on here? "
127,BRIGADIER: An unidentified flying object appears to be heading for
128,"Earth, Mister Chinn. Shouldn't you be in touch with your Ministry? "
129,"CHINN: Oh, er, telephone. Quickly, man, quickly. "
130,BRIGADIER: Captain Yates? 
131,YATES: Sir? 
132,BRIGADIER: Show Mister Chinn the direct line. 
133,YATES: Direct line? 
134,BRIGADIER: In there! 
135,"YATES: Oh, yes, sir. This way, sir. "
136,(Yates takes Chinn into the office. Jo and Filer stand in the doorway.)
137,
138,RADAR 1: Course changing. Two zero seven. Two zero six. 
139,"BRIGADIER: Well, Doctor, what is it? "
140,DOCTOR: I've no idea. 
141,RADAR 1: Two zero five. 
142,DOCTOR: Variable mass. That's interesting. 
143,RADAR 2: Orbital flight path now. 
144,JO: Is it going to hit us? 
145,RADAR 2: UFO entering atmosphere. now. 
146,BRIGADIER: Compute target area. 
147,RADAR 1: Check. 
148,(The Doctor's lips move as he does the maths in his head.) 
149,"DOCTOR: Yes. Somewhere on the south east coast, I should imagine. "
150,"(The shingle beach of Dungeness, most likely, where we watch a tramp"
151,get on a bicycle.)
152,
153, [UNIT office] 
154, (Chinn has made his telephone call.) 
155,CHINN: Brigadier!
156,
157, [UNIT radar tracking]
158,
159," RADAR 2: South Atlantic, moving north. Bearing now"
160,zero two zero.
161,
162, [UNIT radar office] 
163, CHINN: The Minister wants all these facilities
164,linked up to strike force immediately. I have full authority. 
165,BRIGADIER: Yates? 
166,"YATES: All taken care of, sir. "
167,"CHINN: Oh, good. "
168,"(Yates turns on a set of monitors, showing a radar screen and two"
169,angles on a missile.) 
170,RADIO : One cleared. Flight path green one cleared. 
171,"CHINN: Yes, good. Er, get me station command, will you? "
172,"BENTON: Yes, sir. "
173,RADIO : Strike unit A 
174,"CHINN: Chinn here, MOD. You know I'm coordinating this operation, don't"
175,"you. Well, I want you to be ready to destroy this thing the moment I"
176,"give the word. Oh, you are ready. Good. Well, stand by then. "
177,"DOCTOR: All set to destroy it, Brigadier? Whatever it is? "
178,"BRIGADIER: Just a precaution, Doctor. "
179,"DOCTOR: I see. Shoot first and think afterwards, is that it? "
180,RADIO : Strike unit B 
181,(Benton is handed a message. Bell takes a telephone call.) 
182,BENTON: Major nuclear powers deny missile launching. Surveillance
183,confirmed. 
184,"BELL: Estimated target area England, south east coast. There's a report"
185,"in from the Met Office, sir. There are freak weather conditions over"
186,the whole area. 
187,YATES: Explain. 
188,"BELL: Sudden snowstorms, sir. Dense fog's covering the area. "
189,(The tramp is cycling down a snow-covered road when he spots something
190,"in a pile of fly-tipping. It is another bicycle, but it is for a little"
191,girl and he throws it away again in disgust.)
192,
193, [UNIT radar tracking]
194,
195, RADAR 1: UFO over airline flight path Green One.
196,All civil aircraft scattered.
197,
198, [UNIT office] 
199," RADAR 2 : ETA sixty seconds. Repeat, sixty"
200,seconds. Airborne interceptors closing. 
201,"CHINN: (into phone.) Missile strike now! Commit now! Yes, Commander."
202,Now! 
203,"(On the large monitor, a missile is launched.) "
204,CHINN: A perfect sitting target! 
205,"DOCTOR: Hardly seems sporting, does it? "
206,RADAR 2 : Contact lost! Contact lost!
207,
208, [UNIT radar tracking]
209,
210," RADAR 2: It's gone, sir. "
211,"BRIGADIER: What, destroyed? "
212,"RADAR 2: No, you don't understand. It's disappeared, sir, and the"
213,missiles haven't reached it yet. 
214,DOCTOR: Don't you think you'd better abort? What goes up must come down
215,"again. The warheads! Abort, man, abort!"
216,
217, [UNIT office] 
218," CHINN: (into phone.) Abort mission! Destruct,"
219,"destruct, destruct! "
220,(KaBOOM. The tramp cycles on through the wintery wasteland.)
221,
222, [UNIT radar tracking]
223,
224, BRIGADIER: Well? 
225,"RADAR 2: Still no trace of the UFO, sir. "
226,BRIGADIER: It can't have disappeared. 
227,BELL : ITSN report total radar contact lost.
228,
229, [UNIT office] 
230," BRIGADIER: Well, Doctor? Where's it gone? "
231,"DOCTOR: Gone? It hasn't gone anywhere, Brigadier. It's just arriving. "
232,"(A golden glow dazzles the tramp, and he careers off the road and down"
233,into an icy river. The sign by the bridge says Nuton Power Complex 1
234,mile.)
235,
236, [Brigadier's office]
237,
238, CHINN: We have to assume the thing is hostile.
239,It's landed right by the national power complex. Britain's entire power
240,supply is menaced. 
241,BRIGADIER: (into phone) Right. 
242,"CHINN: Brigadier, in accordance with the Emergency Powers Act "
243,"BRIGADIER: All right, Mister Chinn, all right. Yates? "
244,YATES: Sir? 
245,BRIGADIER: All available personnel to the assembly area. 
246,YATES: Sir. Sergeant? 
247,CHINN: I'm treating this as a national emergency. 
248,"BRIGADIER: Yes, yes, so am I. Doctor?"
249,
250, [UNIT office] 
251," CHINN: From now on, you are to consider yourself"
252,under my orders. 
253,"FILER: Er, Brigadier? Where do you want me? "
254,"CHINN: Mister Filer, this is an internal matter. Your presence is not"
255,"necessary. If you don't leave immediately, I shall have to have you"
256,arrested. 
257,BRIGADIER: Mister Chinn! 
258,"FILER: No, no, no, it's all right. It's all right, Brigadier. Well,"
259,"goodbye, Mister Chinn. Take care."
260,
261, [Dungeness]
262,
263, (The tramp comes across the bow of the alien ship
264,"sticking out of the shingle, steaming gently.) "
265,JOSH: Oo-arr? Oo-arr? 
266,"(He runs over to investigate, and the mouth part of the bow opens. A"
267,"long, golden tentacle reaches out and grabs Josh, pulling him inside."
268,"Meanwhile, Filer is driving down a road. He tunes his car radio to the"
269,UNIT frequency.) 
270,YATES : UFO objective confirmed as area north sector national power
271,"complex. All vehicles, repeat, all vehicles, RV this area. Out."
272,
273, [Axos cell]
274,
275," (Josh is lying in an organic area, held down by"
276,claws growing from the floor.) 
277,"AXOS : Analysis pattern reveals locomotor facility normal, sensory"
278,"receptors acute, intelligence atypical. "
279,(Filer's car screeches to a halt near the Axos' landing site and he
280,runs across to it.)Â 
281,"AXOS : This specimen is valueless. Absorb, process and eject. "
282, [Dungeness] 
283, (Filer looks at the bow of the spaceships as a
284,UNIT convoy arrives. Suddenly his throat is grabbed by the tentacle. A
285,klaxon sounds and the convoy comes to a halt by his car. Troops rush
286,across the shingle. 
287,SOLDIER: All right you boys. Go! 
288,"(The Doctor, Brigadier, Jo, Benson and Yates get into the mobile HQ."
289,Several Ministry men join them from a limousine at the rear of the
290,"convoy. Inside the spaceship, Filer is getting the same analysis as the"
291,tramp did.) 
292, [UNIT Mobile HQ]
293,
294," CHINN: Sir George, this is Lethbridge Stewart. "
295,"HARDIMAN: Brigadier, this is Winser, head of research. "
296,(A be-spectacled geek who appears to be a direct descendant of Lt
297,"Carstairs from War Games. Yes,  David Savile returns"
298,to the show.) 
299,WINSER: I hope you're not contemplating an attack so close to the labs?
300,
301,HARDIMAN: You realise this complex provides power for the whole of
302,Britain? An attack would be disastrous. 
303,"BRIGADIER: An attack? By whom, Sir George? We have no idea what we're"
304,up against. We must take these precautions. 
305,CHINN: I've arranged with the army for full artillery support. 
306,"DOCTOR: Artillery? Well, your missiles couldn't find their target, what"
307,chance bazookas? 
308,"BRIGADIER: Sir George, Professor Winser, the Doctor is our scientific"
309,advisor. 
310,"DOCTOR: As far as I can gather with these primitive instruments here,"
311,the device has buried itself deep underground. So there's not much that
312,"anybody can do about it, even if it is a bomb. "
313,HARDIMAN: But you don't think it is? 
314,WINSER: Perhaps I could check the readings? 
315,"DOCTOR: Yes, please do. "
316,"JO: Doctor, look! "
317,(An oscilloscope is going crazy.) 
318,"DOCTOR: You know, I would have said that that was a heartbeat."
319,
320, [Axos cell]
321,
322," AXOS : Intelligent, aggressive, possibly"
323,dangerous. Hold for further investigation.
324,
325, [UNIT Mobile HQ]
326,
327," RADAR 2: Brigadier, something's coming through. "
328,"BRIGADIER: Well, let's hear it. "
329,AXOS : Earth. Axos calling Earth. Fuel systems exhausted. Request
330,"immediate assistance. Immediate assistance. Axos calling Earth, Axos"
331,calling Earth. Fuel system exhausted. 
332,"DOCTOR: More of a cry for help than a threat, wouldn't you say? "
333,"CHINN: Brigadier, we can't wait any longer. We must attack now before"
334,they have time to reorganise their defences. 
335,"DOCTOR: Before you start annihilating the thing, why don't we just take"
336,a look at it? 
337,HARDIMAN: I agree. 
338,"DOCTOR: Jo, I'm sorry. Not this time. "
339,(The Doctor leaves.) 
340,BRIGADIER: Captain Yates. 
341,YATES: Sir? 
342,BRIGADIER: Stay here and act as liaison. Keep an eye on Miss Grant. 
343,YATES: Sir. 
344,"BRIGADIER: Sergeant Benton, check the perimeter guard. "
345,"BENTON: Right, sir."
346,
347, [Dungeness]
348,
349, (The bow opens again.) 
350,AXOS : Axos calling Earth. Request immediate assistance. Axos
351,calling Earth. 
352,"DOCTOR: Right, Gentlemen. Shall we go in? "
353,"(The Doctor, Brigadier, Hardiman, Winser and Chinn enter the spaceship."
354,The entrance closes behind them.)
355,
356, [UNIT Mobile HQ]
357,
358," YATES: It's no good going on at me, Jo. You heard"
359,the Brigadier and he made it perfectly clear that 
360,(Benton enters.) 
361,"YATES: What is it, Benton? "
362,"BENTON: Sir. We've found a body, sir. "
363,YATES: Where? 
364,"BENTON: Over by the north perimeter. And we've found a car, too. A big"
365,Yankee job. 
366,"YATES: Come on then, you'd better show me. "
367,"BENTON: Right, sir. No, Miss, I wouldn't go if I were you. "
368,JO: All right. I'll stay here. 
369,"(The body of the tramp lies in the scrub, under guard. Yates touches it"
370,"and it crumbles to dust. Of course, Jo sneaks out of the mobile HQ.)"
371,
372, [Axos]
373,
374, (The Brigadier leads the group along the round
375,corridor and through a slit in a membrane which acts as a doorway. They
376,are watched by various types of eyes all the time. Suddenly the Doctor
377,"stops and cringes in pain. Outside, nobody tries to stop Jo as she"
378,"walks up to the ship, which opens to let her in.) "
379,AXOS : Attention. Subject non-typical. Investigate. Investigate.
380,Analysis pattern investigates extra-terrestrial. Investigate. 
381,DOCTOR: (faintly) Brigadier! Brigadier! Brigadier! 
382,(The Doctor sees multiple images of the rest of the group but cannot
383,hear them. Jo enters the ship. Axos releases the Doctor.) 
384,"BRIGADIER: Are you all right, Doctor? "
385,"DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose so. I must say, this place is full of surprises,"
386,isn't it? Let's see what else we can find.
387,
388, [Axos cell]
389,
390,(Filer wakes up and tries to break free of the
391,claws holding him down.) 
392,FILER: Help! Help! 
393,(Then he sees another person being held against the wall. A
394,black-clothed figure with neat beard and widow's peak. Serves the
395,Master right.)
396,
397, [Axos]
398,
399, FILER : Help! Help! 
400,"JO: Bill? Bill, is that you?"
401,
402, [Axos main chamber]
403,
404, DOCTOR: Brigadier! Brigadier! 
405,(The others running in. Two figures are visible behind a circular
406,"screen, then four beautiful golden people appear in the chamber. They"
407,"have large blank eyes but are otherwise humanoid, two male and two"
408,female.) 
409,"DOCTOR: Well, gentlemen, there's your enemy. "
410,AXON MAN: Our worlds are uncountable light years away on the far rim of
411,the galaxy. Our planetary system has been crippled by extreme solar
412,flare activity. Axos is all that remains of our culture. As you can
413,"see, our science, unlike yours, has taken an organic path. This ship?"
414,This ship was not built for our journey. It was grown. 
415,WINSER: What? 
416,"AXON MAN: Yes, grown from a single cell and now its nutrient is all but"
417,exhausted. We would like to stay. 
418,CHINN: Well 
419,AXON MAN: Until our nutrition and energy cycles have been fully
420,"replenished. In return, according to your custom, we offer a gift, a"
421,payment. 
422,(A girl steps forward and hold up a large orange blob.) 
423,AXON MAN: Axonite. 
424, [Axos]
425,
426," JO: Bill? Bill, where are you?"
427,
428, [Axos main chamber]
429,
430, (The Axonite has been put on a four foot tall
431,pillar.) 
432,AXON MAN: Axonite is the source of all our growth technology. Axonite
433,"can absorb, convert, transmit and programme all forms of energy. "
434,DOCTOR: Even radiation? Why then were you crippled by solar flare? 
435,AXON MAN: It was already too late. 
436,"CHINN: Perhaps you could explain, just what it is, what it does. My"
437,"report, you understand. "
438,"AXON MAN: Axonite is, shall we say, the chameleon of the elements. It"
439,"is a thinking molecule. It uses the energy it absorbs, not only to copy"
440,but to recreate and restructure any given substance. 
441,DOCTOR: And yet you still ran out of fuel? 
442,WINSER: And the principle? The principle of Axonite? 
443,AXON MAN: It would be simpler for me to demonstrate Axonite.
444,
445, [Axos cell]
446,
447, MASTER: What's your name? 
448,"FILER: Filer, Bill Filer. Who are you? What do you want? "
449,"MASTER: I'm your fellow captive, Filer. I am the Master."
450,
451, [Axos main chamber]
452,
453, (A helpless frog is sitting on the pillar now.) 
454,AXON MAN: A painless lasonic injection of Axonite. 
455,(He takes a large syringe filled with the orange stuff and holds it
456,over the amphibian.) 
457,"AXON MAN: This is, I presume, one of your food animals? "
458,"HARDIMAN: Er, no, no, it isn't. "
459,"AXON MAN: My apologies. Assuming it were, you can see, of course, the"
460,possibilities for alleviating the world's food problems. 
461,(He switches on the syringe and the frog grows. A lot.) 
462,"AXON MAN: The process is, of course, reversible. "
463,(And shrinks again. It is put in a bowl and taken away.) 
464,WINSER: It's incredible! 
465,HARDIMAN: Unlimited food. 
466,DOCTOR: And unlimited power. 
467,CHINN: We must have it!
468,
469, [Axos]
470,
471, JO: Bill? 
472,(One of the root-covered creatures comes out of the wall. She screams.)

474, Episode Two
475,
476, [Axos main chamber]
477,
478, DOCTOR: That's Jo! Come on! 
479,(The Doctor and Brigadier run out.) 
480,"CHINN: Sir George, no, wait! Now, regarding an agreement. "
481,AXON MAN: The emergency is sector seven. I'm sorry. I must investigate.
482,
483,(The Axon man leaves.) 
484,CHINN: I must make my report to the Minister. I think I can take care
485,of this perpetual interference from these UNIT people.
486,
487, [Axos]
488,
489, (The Doctor and Brigadier find Jo lying at the
490,feet of Axon Man.) 
491,DOCTOR: Jo! Are you all right? What's happened? 
492,(The Doctor helps Jo up.) 
493,JO: I saw this thing. It was shapeless and horrible and 
494,(Jo sees Axon Man and squeals.) 
495,"DOCTOR: It's all right, my dear. Don't be frightened. "

502,came straight out of the wall at me!

508,have been hearing things. 
509,JO: Hearing things? 
510,"DOCTOR: Look, Jo, don't worry. The same thing happened to me when I"

523,"MASTER: That ganglion on the wall behind you, you see it? "
524,(It's a green coiled rope thing.) 
525,FILER: Yeah? 
526,MASTER: That's the nerve sector of this section of Axos. Hit that and
527,the shock will disorientate it temporarily. 
528,FILER: And that's our chance? 
529,MASTER: That's our only chance.

684,MASTER: And am I to be released? 
685,"AXON MAN: As yet, we have only gained a foothold. For the maximum"
686,"nutrient value, Axonite must encircle the world within the next seventy"
687,two hours. 
688,"MASTER: And for that to happen, your secret arrangement with the"
689,"British Government must be made universally known. Now, I can do that"

691,"AXON MAN: Your freedom? The bargain, you remember, was that if we"

694,MASTER: And the destruction of all life on Earth.

711,"hope to have controlled acceleration up to the speed of light. Now,"
712,"once beyond that point, the particles will be travelling in the fourth"

737,"DOCTOR: Yes. As a matter of fact, that's the trouble. I can't. "
738,WINSER: How convenient.

1014,HARDIMAN: Radiation? 
1015,CHINN: What happened?

1067,"of this greed, Axonite will soon spread across the entire planet and"
1068,then the nutrition cycle will begin. 
1069,"DOCTOR: Indeed, and what then? "

1377,what I propose to do is this. Stack up as much power as the Tardis will

1664,dust on second rate planet to a third rate star. Do you? 
1665,MASTER: Do you mean to say that you are actually prepared to abandon
1666,your beloved Earth to the Axon's tender mercies? 
1667,"DOCTOR: Certainly. After all, we are both Time Lords. "
1668,"MASTER: Maybe. Look, why should I help you? "

1670,become a prisoner on a doomed planet. 
1671,"MASTER: Yes, well, you'll be doomed along with me. "
1672,DOCTOR: Exactly. We either escape together or we die together. 
1673,"MASTER: Oh, very generous! But look, why not just hand me over to UNIT"
1674,and make your escape by yourself? Well?

1689,"join one to the other, but it'll take time. "
1690,"DOCTOR: Well, it'd better not take too much time. Right, you get on"

1868,"(Everybody leaves, then the Tardis materialises in the lab. Outside,"
1869,the Brigadier drives Jo and Chinn away in Chinn's limousine while UNIT

1871,see the dial at light x 5 and climbing. The ceiling starts to come down

1874,[Dungeness]
1875,
1876,(The vehicles park up and everyone gets out to see
1877,what will happen to the complex.) 
1878,BRIGADIER: Get down! 
1879,JO: What about the Doctor? Supposing he comes back? 
1880,(The Doctor gets the Tardis started again. The research laboratory goes

1894,"DOCTOR: Well, it's perfectly simple, Brigadier. A time loop is, er."
1895,"Well, it's a time loop. One passes continually through the same points"
1896,"in time. Passes through the same. Yes. Well, the Axons said they wanted"
1897,time travel and now they've got it. 
1898,FILER: What about the Master? 
1899,"DOCTOR: Well, I sincerely hope he's with them. "
1900,FILER: Hope?
