19,
20, (The Tardis materialises in dimly lit area with
21,carpeting and display cases.) 
22,ROSE: So what is it? What's wrong? 
23,DOCTOR: Don't know. Some kind of signal drawing the Tardis off course. 
24,ROSE: Where are we? 
25,"DOCTOR: Earth. Utah, North America. About half a mile underground. "
26,ROSE: And when are we? 
27,DOCTOR: Two thousand and twelve. 
28,(He looks at a display case.) 
29,"ROSE: God, that's so close. So I should be twenty six. "
30,"(The Doctor finds the light switch, and things become more clear.) "
31,ROSE: Blimey. It's a great big museum. 
32,DOCTOR: An alien museum. Someone's got a hobby. They must have spent a
33,"fortune on this. Chunks of meteorite, moon dust. That's the milometer"
34,from the Roswell spaceship. 
35,ROSE: That's a bit of Slitheen! That's a Slitheen's arm. It's been
36,stuffed. 
37,"DOCTOR: Oh, look at you. "
38,ROSE: What is it? 
39,(The head of a Cyberman.) 
40,"DOCTOR: An old friend of mine. Well, enemy. The stuff of nightmares"
41,reduced to an exhibit. I'm getting old. 
42,ROSE: Is that where the signal's coming from? 
43,"DOCTOR: No, it's stone dead. The signal's alive. Something's reaching"
44,"out, calling for help. "
45,(The Doctor touches the display case and an alarm goes off. Armed
46,guards rush in from all sides and cut them off from the Tardis.) 
47,"ROSE: If someone's collecting aliens, that makes you Exhibit A. "
48,[Corridor]
49,
50,TANNOY: Attention all personnel. Bad Wolf One
51,descending. Bad Wolf One descending. 
52,(A helicopter has landed. Four armed guards line the corridor as a man
53,and his aides stride out of a doorway.) 
54,"POLKOWSKI: On behalf of all of us, I want to wish you a very happy"
55,"birthday, sir. And the President called to convey his personal best"
56,wishes. 
57,VAN STATTEN: The President is ten points down. I want him replaced. 
58,"POLKOWSKI: I don't think that's very wise, sir. "
59,VAN STATTEN: Thank you so much for your opinion. You're fired. Get rid
60,of him. 
61,POLKOWSKI: What? 
62,(An armed guard drags Polkowski away.) 
63,"VAN STATTEN: Wipe his memory, put him on the road someplace. Memphis,"
64,Minneapolis. Somewhere beginning with M. 
65,(A woman runs up to take Polkowski's place.) 
66,"VAN STATTEN: So, the next President. What do you think? Republican or"
67,Democrat? 
68,"GODDARD: Democrat, sir. "
69,VAN STATTEN: For what reason? 
70,"GODDARD: They're just so funny, sir? "
71,(Van Statten stops.) 
72,VAN STATTEN: What is your name? 
73,"GODDARD: Goddard, sir. Diana Goddard. "
74,"VAN STATTEN: I like you, Diana Goddard. So, where's the English kid? "
75,"ADAM: Sir! Sir! I bought ten more artefacts at auction, Mister Van"
76,Statten. 
77,"VAN STATTEN: Bring 'em on, let me see 'em. "
78,"GODDARD: Sir, with respect, there's something more urgent. We arrested"
79,two intruders fifty three floors down. We don't know how they got in. 
80,VAN STATTEN: I'll tell you how they got in. In-tru-da window. In-tru-da
81,window. That was funny! 
82,(Obedient laughter.) 
83,VAN STATTEN: Bring 'em in. Let's see 'em. And tell Simmons I want to
84,visit my little
85,pet. Get to it! 
86,(Van Statten goes through a doorway. Goddard steps aside to use her
87,headset.) 
88,GODDARD: Simmons? You'd better give me good news. Is it talking? 
89,[Cage]
90,
91, (Something with blue vision is watching a man
92,wearing a protective suit wielding a chainsaw on itself.) 
93,"SIMMONS: Not exactly talking, no. "
94,[Corridor]
95,
96,GODDARD: Then what's it doing? 
97,[Cage]
98,
99,SIMMONS: Screaming. Is that any good? 
100,[Office]
101,
102, (Adam is showing his boss the latest purchases.) 
103,ADAM: And this is the last. Paid eight hundred thousand dollars for it.
104,
105,"(The Doctor, Rose and Goddard enter.) "
106,VAN STATTEN: What does it do? 
107,"ADAM: Well, you see the tubes on the side? It must be to channel"
108,something. I think maybe fuel. 
109,DOCTOR: I really wouldn't hold it like that. 
110,GODDARD: Shut it. 
111,"DOCTOR: Really, though, that's wrong. "
112,ADAM: Is it dangerous? 
113,"DOCTOR: No, it just looks silly. "
114,"(The Doctor reaches for the item, and firing bolts click all around"
115,"him. Van Stratton hands him the curved, palm sized object.) "
116,DOCTOR: You just need to be 
117,(The Doctor strokes the artefact and it makes a note.) 
118,DOCTOR: Delicate. 
119,(He plays several different notes.) 
120,VAN STATTEN: It's a musical instrument. 
121,DOCTOR: And it's a long way from home. 
122,"VAN STATTEN: Here, let me. "
123,(Van Statten's touch is harsher. Not nice sounds are produced.) 
124,DOCTOR: I did say delicate. It reacts to the smallest fingerprint. It
125,needs precision. 
126,(Van Statten finally gets the hang of it.) 
127,DOCTOR: Very good. Quite the expert. 
128,VAN STATTEN: As are you. 
129,"(Van Statton casually tosses it aside, onto the floor.) "
130,VAN STATTEN: Who exactly are you? 
131,DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. And who are you? 
132,VAN STATTEN: Like you don't know. We're hidden away with the most
133,"valuable collection of extra-terrestrial artefacts in the world, and"
134,you just stumbled in by mistake. 
135,"DOCTOR: Pretty much sums me up, yeah. "
136,"VAN STATTEN: The question is, how did you get in? Fifty three floors"
137,"down, with your little cat burglar accomplice. You're quite a collector"
138,"yourself, she's rather pretty. "
139,ROSE: She's going to smack you if you keep calling her she. 
140,"VAN STATTEN: She's English too! Hey, little Lord Fauntleroy. Got you a"
141,girlfriend. 
142,ADAM: This is Mister Henry Van Statten. 
143,ROSE: And who's he when he's at home? 
144,ADAM: Mister Van Statten owns the internet. 
145,ROSE: Don't be stupid. No one owns the internet. 
146,"VAN STATTEN: And let's just keep the whole world thinking that way,"
147,right kids? 
148,DOCTOR: So you're just about an expert in everything except the things
149,"in your museum. Anything you don't understand, you lock up. "
150,VAN STATTEN: And you claim greater knowledge? 
151,"DOCTOR: I don't need to make claims, I know how good I am. "
152,"VAN STATTEN: And yet, I captured you. Right next to the Cage. What were"
153,you doing down there? 
154,DOCTOR: You tell me. 
155,VAN STATTEN: The cage contains my one living specimen. 
156,DOCTOR: And what's that? 
157,VAN STATTEN: Like you don't know. 
158,DOCTOR: Show me. 
159,VAN STATTEN: You want to see it? 
160,"ROSE: Blimey, you can smell the testosterone. "
161,"VAN STATTEN: Goddard, inform the Cage we're heading down. You, English."
162,Look after the girl. Go and canoodle or spoon or whatever it is you
163,"British do. And you, Doctor with no name, come and see my pet."
164,
165,[Outside the Cage]
166,
167,VAN STATTEN: We've tried everything. The creature
168,has shielded itself but there's definite signs of life inside. 
169,DOCTOR: Inside? Inside what? 
170,"SIMMONS: Welcome back, sir. I've had to take the power down. The"
171,Metaltron is resting. 
172,DOCTOR: Metaltron? 
173,"VAN STATTEN: Thought of it myself. Good, isn't it? Although I'd much to"
174,prefer to find out it's real name. 
175,"SIMMONS: Here, you'd better put these on. (gauntlets) The last guy that"
176,touched it burst into flames. 
177,DOCTOR: I won't touch it then. 
178,"VAN STATTEN: Go ahead, Doctor. Impress me. "
179,(The Doctor steps through the heavy door.) 
180,VAN STATTEN: Don't open that door until we get a result. 
181,(Van Statten and Goddard go to a desk with monitors on it.) 
182, [Cage] 
183, (It is dark inside. The door clangs shut and
184,locks.) 
185,"DOCTOR: Look, I'm sorry about this. Mister Van Statten might think he's"
186,"clever, but never mind him. I've come to help. I'm the Doctor. "
187,(A white light blinks next to a blue glow.) 
188,METALTRON: Doc Tor? 
189,DOCTOR: Impossible. 
190,METALTRON: The Doctor? 
191,(The lights come up to reveal a bad tempered pepperpot being held in
192,chains.) 
193,DALEK: Exterminate! Exterminate! 
194,(The Doctor hammers on the door in terror.) 
195,DOCTOR: Let me out! 
196,DALEK: Exterminate!
197,
198,[Outside the Cage]
199,
200,"GODDARD: Sir, it's going to kill him. "
201,VAN STATTEN: It's talking!
202,
203,[Cage]
204,
205,DALEK: You are an enemy of the Daleks! You must be
206,destroyed! 
207,(Its gun arm twitches but nothing happens.) 
208,DOCTOR: It's not working. 
209,(The Doctor laughs as the Dalek looks at its impotent weapon.) 
210,"DOCTOR: Fantastic! Oh, fantastic! Powerless! Look at you. The great"
211,space dustbin. How does it feel? 
212,DALEK: Keep back! 
213,"(The Doctor stands inches away, staring into its eyepiece.) "
214,"DOCTOR: What for? What're you going to do to me? If you can't kill,"
215,"then what are you good for, Dalek? What's the point of you? You're"
216,nothing.
217,
218,[Outside the Cage]
219,
220,DOCTOR : What the hell are you here
221,for? 
222,DALEK : I am waiting for orders. 
223,[Cage]
224,
225,DOCTOR: What does that mean? 
226,DALEK: I am a soldier. I was bred to receive orders. 
227,DOCTOR: Well you're never going to get any. Not ever. 
228,DALEK: I demand orders! 
229,"DOCTOR: They're never going to come! Your race is dead! You all burnt,"
230,all of you. Ten million ships on fire. The entire Dalek race wiped out
231,in one second. 
232,DALEK: You lie! 
233,DOCTOR: I watched it happen. I made it happen. 
234,DALEK: You destroyed us? 
235,DOCTOR: I had no choice. 
236,DALEK: And what of the Time Lords? 
237,DOCTOR: Dead. They burnt with you. The end of the last great Time War.
238,Everyone lost. 
239,DALEK: And the coward survived. 
240,"DOCTOR: Oh, and I caught your little signal. Help me. Poor little"
241,thing. But there's no one else coming 'cause there's no one else left. 
242,DALEK: I am alone in the universe. 
243,DOCTOR: Yep. 
244,DALEK: So are you. We are the same. 
245,"DOCTOR: We're not the same! I'm not (pause) No, wait. Maybe we are."
246,"You're right. Yeah, okay. You've got a point. 'Cause I know what to do."
247,I know what should happen. I know what you deserve. Exterminate. 
248,(The Doctor pulls a lever on a nearby console and the Dalek is lit up
249,with electricity.) 
250,DALEK: Have pity! 
251,DOCTOR: Why should I? You never did. 
252,[Outside the Cage]
253,
254, VAN STATTEN: Get him out. 
255,[Cage]
256,
257,DALEK: Help me! 
258,(Guards grab the Doctor as he goes to ramp up the voltage again.) 
259,"VAN STATTEN: I saved your life. Now talk to me. Goddamn it, talk to me!"
260,
261,(Simmons turns off the electricity.) 
262,DOCTOR: You've got to destroy it! 
263,(The Doctor is dragged out.) 
264,VAN STATTEN: The last in the universe. And now I know your name. Dalek.
265,"Speak to me, Dalek. I am Henry van Statten, now recognise me! Make it"
266,"talk again, Simmons. Whatever it takes. "
267,[Adam's workshop]
268,
269,ADAM: Sorry about the mess. Mister Van Statten sort
270,"of lets me do my own thing, so long as I deliver the goods. What do you"
271,think that is? 
272,(Adam gives Rose an inch think piece of metal.) 
273,"ROSE: Er, a lump of metal? "
274,"ADAM: Yeah. Yeah, but I think, well, I'm almost certain, it's from the"
275,"hull of a spacecraft. The thing is, it's all true. Everything the"
276,"United Nations tries to keep quiet, spacecraft, aliens, visitors to"
277,Earth. They really exist. 
278,ROSE: That's amazing. 
279,"ADAM: I know it sounds incredible, but I honestly believe the whole"
280,universe is just teeming with life. 
281,"ROSE: I'm gobsmacked, yeah. And you do what, sit here and catalogue it?"
282,
283,ADAM: Best job in the world. 
284,ROSE: Imagine if you could get out there. Travel amongst the stars and
285,see it for real. 
286,"ADAM: Yeah, I'd give anything. I don't think it's ever going to happen."
287,Not in our lifetimes. 
288,"ROSE: Oh, you never know. What about all those people who say they've"
289,been inside of spaceships and things and talked to aliens? 
290,ADAM: I think they're nutters. 
291,"ROSE: Yeah, me too. So, how'd you end up here? "
292,ADAM: Van Statten has agents all over the world looking for geniuses to
293,recruit. 
294,"ROSE: Oh, right. You're a genius. "
295,"ADAM: Sorry, but yeah. I can't help it. I was born clever. When I was"
296,"eight, I logged onto the US Defence System. Nearly caused World War"
297,Three. 
298,"ROSE: What, and that's funny, is it? "
299,"ADAM: Well, you should've been there just to see them running about."
300,Fantastic! 
301,ROSE: You sound like the Doctor. 
302,ADAM: Are you and him? 
303,"ROSE: No, we're just friends. "
304,ADAM: Good. 
305,ROSE: Why is it good? 
306,ADAM: It just is. 
307,"ROSE: So, wouldn't you rather be downstairs? I mean, you've got these"
308,"bits of metal and stuff, but Mister Van Statten's got a living creature"
309,down there. 
310,"ADAM: Yeah. Yeah, well, I did ask, but he keeps it to himself."
311,"Although, if you're a genius, it doesn't take long to patch through on"
312,the comm. system. 
313,"ROSE: Let's have a look, then. "
314,"ADAM: It doesn't do much, the alien. It's weird. It's kind of useless."
315,It's just like this great big pepper pot. 
316,(They watch the Dalek screaming as Simmons takes a big drill to its
317,casing.) 
318,ROSE: It's being tortured! Where's the Doctor? 
319,ADAM: I don't know. 
320,ROSE: Take me down there now. 
321,[Lift]
322,
323,DOCTOR: The metal's just battle armour. The real
324,Dalek creature's inside. 
325,VAN STATTEN: What does it look like? 
326,DOCTOR: A nightmare. It's a mutation. The Dalek race was genetically
327,engineered. Every single emotion was removed except hate. 
328,VAN STATTEN: Genetically engineered. By whom? 
329,"DOCTOR: By a genius, Van Statten. By a man who was king of his own"
330,little world. You'd like him. 
331,GODDARD: It's been on Earth for over fifty years. Sold at a private
332,"auction, moving from one collection to another. Why would it be a"
333,threat now? 
334,DOCTOR: Because I'm here. How did it get to Earth? Does anyone know? 
335,GODDARD: The records say it came from the sky like a meteorite. It fell
336,to Earth on the Ascension Islands. Burnt in its crater for three days
337,before anybody could get near it and all that time it was screaming. It
338,must have gone insane. 
339,DOCTOR: It must have fallen through time. The only survivor. 
340,GODDARD: You talked about a war? 
341,DOCTOR: The Time War. The final battle between my people and the Dalek
342,race. 
343,"VAN STATTEN: But you survived, too. "
344,DOCTOR: Not by choice. 
345,VAN STATTEN: This means that the Dalek isn't the only alien on Earth.
346,"Doctor, there's you. The only one of your kind in existence. "
347,[Doctor's cage]
348,
349,(So the Doctor is stripped and chained
350,spread-eagled.) 
351,"VAN STATTEN: Now, smile! "
352,(A painful laser scan runs down the Doctor's body.) 
353,"VAN STATTEN: Two hearts! Binary vascular system. Oh, I am so going to"
354,patent this. 
355,"DOCTOR: So that's your secret. You don't just collect this stuff, you"
356,scavenge it. 
357,VAN STATTEN: This technology has been falling to Earth for centuries.
358,"All it took was the right mind to use it properly. Oh, the advances"
359,"I've made from alien junk. You have no idea, Doctor. Broadband?"
360,Roswell. Just last year my scientists cultivated bacteria from the
361,"Russian crater, and do you know what we found? The cure for the common"
362,cold. Kept it strictly within the laboratory of course. No need to get
363,people excited. Why sell one cure when I can sell a thousand
364,palliatives? 
365,"DOCTOR: Do you know what a Dalek is, Van Statten? A Dalek is honest. It"
366,does what it was born to do for the survival of its species. That
367,creature in your dungeon is better than you. 
368,"VAN STATTEN: In that case, I will be true to myself and continue. "
369,DOCTOR: Listen to me! That thing downstairs is going to kill every last
370,one of us! 
371,VAN STATTEN: Nothing can escape the Cage. 
372,(He blasts the Doctor with the laser again.) 
373,DOCTOR: But it's woken up. It knows I'm here. It's going to get out.
374,"Van Statten, I swear, no one on this base is safe. No one on this"
375,planet! 
376,"(Van Statten runs the laser scan again, just to hear the Doctor"
377,scream.)
378,
379,[Outside the Cage]
380,
381,BYWATER: Hold it right there. 
382,ADAM: Level three access. Special clearance from Mister Van Statten. 
383,[Cage]
384,
385,ADAM: Don't get too close. 
386,(The door closes behind Rose and Adam.) 
387,"ROSE: Hello. Are you in pain? My name's Rose Tyler. I've got a friend,"
388,he can help. He's called the Doctor. What's your name? 
389,DALEK: Yes. 
390,ROSE: What? 
391,"DALEK: I am in pain. They torture me, but still they fear me. Do you"
392,fear me? 
393,ROSE: No. 
394,DALEK: I am dying. 
395,"ROSE: No, we can help. "
396,DALEK: I welcome death. But I am glad that before I die I have met a
397,human who was not afraid. 
398,ROSE: Isn't there anything I can do? 
399,"DALEK: My race is dead, and I shall die alone. "
400,(Rose reaches for the Dalek's head.) 
401,"ADAM: Rose, no! "
402,(A brief touch leaves a golden handprint which quickly fades. The Dalek
403,becomes more animated.) 
404,DALEK: Genetic material extrapolated. Initiate cellular reconstruction!
405,
406,(The Dalek breaks its chains. Simmons enters.) 
407,SIMMONS: What the hell have you done? 
408,"(He goes to the Dalek, carrying his drill. The Dalek raises its sink"
409,plunger.) 
410,SIMMONS: What are you going to do? Sucker me to death? 
411,(However did you guess? The sucker covers his nose and mouth and the
412,Dalek creates a vacuum inside it. Ouch!) 
413, [Outside the Cage] 
414,ROSE: It's killing him! Do something! 
415,BYWATER: Condition red! Condition red! 
416,[Doctor's cage]
417,
418,"GUARD : I repeat, this is not a drill! "
419,DOCTOR: Release me if you want to live. 
420,[Office]
421,
422,(The scene in the Cage is on a large wall TV.) 
423,DOCTOR: You've got to keep it in that cell. 
424,"ROSE [on screen]: Doctor, it's all my fault. "
425,"GUARD [on screen]: I've sealed the compartment. It can't get out, that"
426,lock's got a billion combinations. 
427,DOCTOR: A Dalek's a genius. It can calculate a thousand billion
428,combinations in one second flat. 
429,[Outside the Cage]
430,
431, (And that is precisely what the Dalek uses its
432,sucker to do.) 
433,BYWATER: Open fire! 
434,[Office]
435,
436,VAN STATTEN: Don't shoot it! I want it unharmed. 
437,"DOCTOR: Rose, get out of there! "
438,[Outside the Cage]
439,
440,"BYWATER: De Maggio, take the civilians and get them"
441,"out alive. That is your job, got that? "
442,(The woman guard obeys.) 
443,"DE MAGGIO: You, with me. "
444,[Outside the Cage]
445,
446,(The Dalek glides up to the wall monitor and
447,"smashes it, absorbing the electricity. It's battered armour starts to"
448,"mend, turning from brown to golden.) "
449,"BYWATER: Abandoning the Cage, sir. "
450,[Office]
451,
452,GODDARD: We're losing power. It's draining the
453,"base. Oh, my God. It's draining entire power supplies for the whole of"
454,Utah. 
455,DOCTOR: It's downloading. 
456,VAN STATTEN: Downloading what? 
457,"GODDARD: Sir, the entire West Coast has gone down. "
458,DOCTOR: It's not just energy. That Dalek just absorbed the entire
459,internet. It knows everything. 
460, [Outside the Cage]
461,
462,DALEK: The Daleks survive in me! 
463,(The Dalek uses its weapon on its surroundings.)
464,
465,[Office]
466,
467,GODDARD: The cameras in the vault have gone down. 
468,DOCTOR: We've only got emergency power. It's eaten everything else.
469,You've got to kill it now! 
470,"GODDARD: All guards to converge in the Metaltron cage, immediately. "
471,[Corridor]
472,
473,DE MAGGIO: Civilians! Let them through! 
474,"(Rose and Adam, and de Maggio, run through the incoming phalanx of"
475,guards.) 
476,"BYWATER: Cover the north wall. Red division, maintain suppressing fire"
477,along the perimeter. Blue division argh!

488,GODDARD: But it's killing them! 
489,VAN STATTEN: They're dispensable. That Dalek is unique. I don't want a
490,"scratch on its bodywork, do you hear me? Do you hear me? "
491,"(The gunfire stops, but only because there is no one left to shoot."

493,"GODDARD: That's us, right below the surface. That's the cage, and"
494,that's the Dalek. 
495,DOCTOR: This museum of yours. Have you got any alien weapons? 
496,"GODDARD: Lots of them, but the trouble is the Dalek's between us and"
497,them. 
498,VAN STATTEN: We've got to keep that thing alive. We could just seal the
499,"entire vault, trap it down there. "
500,DOCTOR: Leaving everyone trapped with it. Rose is down there. I won't
501,let that happen. Have you got that? It's got to go through this area.
502,What's that?

511,(They run a flight and look down on the Dalek.) 
512,ADAM: Great big alien death machine defeated by a flight of stairs. 
513,DE MAGGIO: Now listen to me. I demand that you return to your cage. If
514,you want to negotiate then I can guarantee that Mister van Statten will
515,be willing to talk. I accept that we imprisoned you and maybe that was
516,"wrong, but people have died, and that stops right now. The killing"
517,stops. Have you got that? I demand that you surrender. Is that clear?

533,needs. Everything needs something. 
534,DOCTOR: What's the nearest town? 
535,VAN STATTEN: Salt Lake City. 
536,DOCTOR: Population? 
537,VAN STATTEN: One million. 
538,"DOCTOR: All dead. If the Dalek gets out, it'll murder every living"
539,creature. That's all it needs. 
540,VAN STATTEN: But why would it do that? 
541,DOCTOR: Because it honestly believes they should die. Human beings are
542,"different, and anything different is wrong. It's the ultimate in racial"
543,"cleansing and you, Van Statten, you've let it loose! The Dalek's"

545,"hit home, but it's not indestructible. "

566,ADAM: So? It's just a sort of metal eye thing. It's looking all around.
