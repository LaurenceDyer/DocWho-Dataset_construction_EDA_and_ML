20,One 
21, [The Master's Lair]
22,
23,(The story carries straight on from 
24,Frontier in
25,"Space. The Doctor has been accidentally shot by the Master,"
26,as the Ogrons jolted his arm whilst fleeing from a generated image of
27,"the thing they feared most. Now the place is deserted, and the Doctor"
28,wakes. He is very weak.) 
29,"JO: Oh, Doctor, I thought you were dead. "
30,DOCTOR: Help me up. 
31,"JO: Come on. That's it, yes. Careful. "
32,"DOCTOR: Help me into the Tardis, Jo. "
33,JO: Okay.
34,
35, [Tardis]
36,
37," DOCTOR: All right, Jo. "
38,JO: Careful. 
39,DOCTOR: The first thing we've got to do is get out of here. 
40,(The Tardis dematerialises. The Doctor places his hands on two round
41,disc on the console and concentrates.) 
42,"JO: Doctor, what are you doing? "
43,DOCTOR: Telepathic circuits. Sending a message to the Time Lords. I
44,"must tell them to. I must, I "
45,(The Doctor collapses.) 
46,JO: Doctor! 
47,(Jo runs over to a wall covered in what appear to be fitted drawers and
48,cupboards. She presses one and a bed slides out.) 
49,"JO: Come on, come and sit down. Come on. That's it. "
50,DOCTOR: Help me off with this. 
51,JO: Let me get this. Now just lie back. 
52,"DOCTOR: Must lie down, Jo. "
53,JO: Yes. 
54,"DOCTOR: Must rest for a while. Must rest. I must rest, Jo. "
55,JO: Yes. 
56,(Jo dabs at the blood on his forehead.) 
57,JO: It's all right. 
58,"DOCTOR: Now, Jo, now listen to me. I'm liable to sleep for quite some"
59,"time. Now, if anything happens, anything at all, record it in the log."
60,Record it in the log. 
61,JO: Log? 
62,DOCTOR: Yes. 
63,"JO: What log? Doctor, I don't know what you're talking about! "
64,"DOCTOR: In the log, up there in the locker. "
65,(Jo takes what looks like a large cassette tape from a cupboard above
66,the bed.) 
67,JO: Doctor? 
68,"(The Doctor is unconscious. Later, Jo has got changed and freshened up,"
69,and returns to the console room to find him delirious.) 
70,"DOCTOR: Jo! Jo, careful! "
71,JO: Doctor? 
72,DOCTOR: Jo! JO: Doctor? 
73,DOCTOR: Jo! 
74,JO: Doctor! 
75,"(The Doctor goes quite still, so Jo checks his hearts.) "
76,"JO: Oh, he's so cold. "
77,(Jo makes her first log entry.) 
78,"JO: Shortly after entering the Tardis, the Doctor fell into a deep"
79,coma. His respiration was very shallow and his skin icy to the touch. I
80,"could find no trace of pulse or heartbeat, and his breathing apparently"
81,ceased. But I've seen the Doctor in this condition once before and he
82,recovered after a sudden rise in temperature. 
83,(Something beeps on the Tardis console and it starts to materialise.) 
84,JO: The Tardis seems to have landed. I suppose the Time Lords are
85,working it by remote control again. I've no idea what the Doctor said
86,"to them in his message, or where we are. I just hope that they've"
87,brought us somewhere where I can find some help for the Doctor. 
88,(Crystals are forming on the Doctor's skin.) 
89,JO: Ice! 
90,(The Doctor's eyes open.) 
91,"JO: Doctor! Doctor, you're alive! Doctor? Doctor, I don't know whether"
92,"you can hear me or not. Both your hearts are beating about oh, about"
93,once every ten seconds and your body temperature is somewhere below
94,zero. I'm going outside. I'm going to try and find some help. 
95,(Jo goes to the console.) 
96,"JO: Scanner, scanner. Scanner. That's it. "
97,(The scanner shows a lush jungle outside with some stone ruins. Then
98,something squirts liquid onto the scanner obscuring the view.) 
99,"JO: Doctor? Doctor, I'm going now. I'll be back as soon as I can."
100,
101, [Jungle] 
102," (Jo goes outside, and she gets squirted with the"
103,liquid which is coming from some of the local flowers. The lower half
104,of the Tardis has a brown encrustation over it. Jo looks at the
105,"standing stones then heads off through the thick vegetation, nervous at"
106,the sound of animals that fill the jungle. She is carrying the log
107,"recorder, and settles down at the base of a tree to rest. Suddenly the"
108,sky becomes very bright.) 
109,JO: Things growing in this jungle seem more like animal than plant
110,life. The light is changing. It seems as if it's daybreak. There's a
111,sudden change in temperature. I haven't seen any form of intelligent
112,"life except, except those bits of statue by the Tardis. "
113,"(Now it is warmer, Jo takes off her raincoat. The back is covered with"
114,the encrustation from the plant liquid. She throws it away and moves
115,"off. The pitcher plants watch her go, and something we cannot see puffs"
116,and pants its way through the bamboo after her.)
117,
118, [Tardis]
119,
120," DOCTOR: Jo? Jo, where are you? "
121,(The Doctor appears completely healed. We can still hear the arum
122,plants squirting liquid at the Tardis.) 
123,DOCTOR: Jo? Jo? 
124,(Jo finds some footprints in the soil. She takes off her mittens as she
125,"bends down to examine them, and gets squirted. She moves on. The Doctor"
126,checks the console.) 
127,DOCTOR: That's odd. The atmosphere outside is breathable and yet the
128,automatic oxygen supply is on.
129,
130, [Jungle - landing site]
131,
132, (Jo has put her mittens on again and followed the
133,footprints to a spacecraft. She goes up to a hatch between its two
134,engine exhausts.) 
135,"JO: Hello? Hello, is anybody there? "
136,(She walks along the side of the ship but there are no other visible
137,doorways so she returns to the rear and opens the hatch. The inside is
138,small but tidy with dials on the wall. Up front is a figure in a
139,"spacesuit, with cobwebs. She touches it and it tumbles sideways.)"
140,
141, [Tardis]
142,
143, (The Tardis door does not open. It sounds as if it
144,is blocked by something. Then an alarm sounds and the monitor shows the
145,message 'Automatic Oxygen Supply Exhausted') 
146,DOCTOR: I'll just have to use the emergency supply. 
147,(The Doctor opens a small wheeled box and opens the valve of the first
148,cylinder. It hisses briefly and stops. He tries the second but that
149,runs out too. The third and final one seems to work properly so he goes
150,to get changed. Then the oxygen runs out of that one too.)
151,
152, [Spaceship]
153,
154, (Jo tries to hide as someone approaches the ship.
155,It is a blond man in a spacesuit with a weapon. He easily finds Jo and
156,brings her into the main compartment. There is a younger man with him.)
157,
158,JO: Who are you? 
159,TARON: My name is Taron. 
160,(Everyone say Hi! to  Bernard
161,Horsfall - again) 
162,TARON: This is Vaber. 
163,JO: I'm Jo Grant. Do you live here? I mean do you live on this planet? 
164,TARON: What are you? Where are you from? 
165,"JO: Well, I'm from a planet called Earth. "
166,VABER: Earth? 
167,(Say Hi! to 
168,"Prentice Hancock,"
169,before Space 1999.) 
170,JO: You've heard of it? 
171,TARON: We've heard of the name. 
172,VABER: There is no such place as Earth. It's just a name in our old
173,legends. It doesn't really exist. 
174,"JO: Believe me, it does! "
175,TARON: How did you come here? 
176,JO: In the Tardis. 
177,TARON: Tardis? 
178,"JO: Well, yes, it's a sort of spaceship. "
179,VABER: Are you alone? 
180,"JO: No. No, I have a friend with me and he's very sick. I was trying to"
181,"find some help for him. Look, I'm afraid he's dying. "
182,VABER: We're not a hospital service. 
183,"JO: Oh please? Please, you've got to help me. "
184,TARON: I'm qualified in space medicine. I'll do what I can. 
185,JO: Thank you. I was beginning to think that I'd never find anybody to
186,help me. 
187,VABER: You were lucky they didn't find you. 
188,JO: They? 
189,"TARON: Where is this ship of yours, the Tardis? "
190,"JO: Well, back through the jungle. "
191,TARON: Is it far? 
192,"JO: Well, no, not far. It's by some bits of statue. "
193,VABER: Reference seven? 
194,"TARON: Yes, yes, yes. "
195,"JO: Look, come on, I'll take you there, right? "
196,(Another blond man in a spacesuit enters.) 
197,"CODAL: Very near, a patrol. "
198,VABER: How many? 
199,"CODAL: Three or four, headed this way. Who's this? "
200,TARON: We have to move. 
201,"JO: Well, I'm coming with you. "
202,"TARON: No, we know this jungle now. We can move in it quietly and"
203,quickly. You'll be safer if you stay hidden here. 
204,(Taron opens a small compartment.) 
205,TARON: Get inside. You can work the securer from in there. 
206,JO: But I want to come with you. 
207,TARON: That would slow us all up. You'd endanger all of us. Don't
208,"worry. We'll lead them away from here, lose them in the jungle. "
209,JO: Lose who? 
210,VABER: Come on! Come on! 
211,TARON: We'll do what we can for your friend. I'll come back for you
212,later. 
213,JO: Thank you. Please hurry! 
214,"(The three men move off, weapons ready. Jo shuts herself in the small"
215,"compartment and watches through the door grill. The spaceship rocks,"
216,"there is the sound of breathing, and a small object rises up, twists"
217,around then goes back to where it was. Then a door opens and items are
218,thrown out onto the floor.)
219,
220, [Jungle]
221,
222, VABER: Which way are they moving? 
223,TARON: We're all right. They seem to be staying on the main tracks.
224,"There's a few scouts moving independently, but off that way. "
225,CODAL: What about the girl? 
226,"TARON: Oh, she should be all right. "
227,VABER: And this friend of hers? 
228,TARON: Let's go and find him. 
229,"(In the spaceship, something tries the handle to Jo's compartment but"
230,"cannot get in. What might be a fire extinguisher is picked up, examined"
231,"and put down, then the outer hatch opens and closes and triangular"
232,prints appear in the soft soil. Jo comes out of hiding and leaves the
233,spaceship.)
234,
235, [Tardis]
236,
237, (The scanner now says 'Cabin Atmosphere Unable to
238,Sustain Life'. The Doctor is working under the console.) 
239,DOCTOR: All the circuits are in order. The door must be held from the
240,outside. I must get it open. I must get that door open. Got to get the
241,"door, got to get that door open. "
242,(He staggers to the doors and tries to push.) 
243,DOCTOR: That's it. Must get it open. (falls to the floor) Must get it
244,"open. Must get, must get, must get."
245,
246, [Jungle - Ruins]
247,
248," (Outside the Tardis, Vaber and Taron are hacking"
249,at the encrustation on the doors while Codal stands guard. The two men
250,are wearing plastic protection from the liquid. The doors swing open
251,and they carry the Doctor out and away from the Tardis.) 
252,"TARON: Right, sit him down here. "
253,(They take off the plastic hoods and gauntlets.) 
254,DOCTOR: Thank you. Thank you very much. How did you find me? 
255,TARON: A girl we met. 
256,VABER: She told us where you were. 
257,DOCTOR: Is she all right? 
258,TARON: She should be. 
259,VABER: We left her hiding. 
260,TARON: Circle round the neighbourhood. See if there's any activity. 
261,(Codal leaves.) 
262,VABER: What are you staring at? 
263,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sorry, it's just, just that I thought I knew you. "
264,VABER: That's not likely. 
265,DOCTOR: Where are you from? 
266,"TARON: A planet, many systems from here. "
267,"DOCTOR: Skaro! Yes, of course, you're Thals! "
268,TARON: How did you know that? 
269,"DOCTOR:  Because I've been to Skaro,"
270,that's why. 
271,TARON: When? 
272,"DOCTOR: Oh, many years ago. During the Dalek war. "
273,VABER: Dalek war? 
274,DOCTOR: Yes. 
275,VABER: That's impossible. That was generations ago. You couldn't have
276,been there. 
277,"DOCTOR: Well, I can assure you that I was. "
278,TARON: How? 
279,"DOCTOR: By travelling through the barriers of time. If you must know, I"
280,was with the Thal group when they broke into the Dalek city. 
281,"TARON: In our legend, there is a being, a figure from another planet"
282,"who came to Skaro when the Thals were in their greatest peril, in"
283,something called a Tardis. He had three companions with him. 
284,"DOCTOR: Yes. Barbara, Ian and Susan. "
285,VABER: And their leader was called? 
286,DOCTOR: The Doctor. 
287,TARON: Are you trying to tell us that you are the Doctor? 
288,DOCTOR: That's right. 
289,VABER: That's nonsense! You've come to spy on us. What are you doing on
290,"this planet? Here, of all the planets in the galaxy! Answer! "
291,"DOCTOR: Now you listen to me, young man. You may have saved my life,"
292,"and I'm grateful, but that does not give you the right to subject me to"
293,an inquisition! 
294,(The Doctor wipes something from his cheek.) 
295,"TARON: Vaber, give me the spray. "
296,DOCTOR: What? 
297,VABER: Waste our medical supplies? 
298,"TARON: The spray, Vaber. "
299,DOCTOR: What are you doing? 
300,TARON: You have been infected by a particularly deadly fungus. Close
301,your eyes. 
302,(Taron sprays the Doctor's face.) 
303,TARON: They spread their spores in that liquid they've discharged. And
304,the fungus spreads very quickly unless the surface has been specially
305,"treated. Turn your hand over. There, that should be all right now. "
306,"DOCTOR: Now? Why, what would have happened? "
307,TARON: Without special treatment it would have spread all over your
308,body. 
309,"DOCTOR: Ah, that's nice. "
310,"TARON: Until finally, you'd have been engulfed by it. "
311,DOCTOR: Oh. 
312,(Jo has returned to the spaceship and is taking off her jacket. She
313,"sees a growth on the back of her hand, like the stuff on her raincoat.)"
314,
315,"VABER: Come on, let's get started. "
316,TARON: No. We wait for Codal. 
317,"DOCTOR: Tell me, what's the name of this planet? "
318,VABER: Spiridon. One of the nastiest pieces of space garbage in the
319,ninth system. 
320,DOCTOR: Is it inhabited? 
321,"VABER: Oh, yes. Vegetation that's more like animal life than plant,"
322,creatures hostile to everything including themselves and a climate that
323,changes from tropical in the day to sub-freezing in the night. 
324,DOCTOR: Any intelligent life form? 
325,"TARON: Oh, yes. the Spiridons. They're invisible. "
326,"DOCTOR: Mmm, I'd very much like to see one of them. I mean, I'd very"
327,much like to come into contact with one of them. 
328,"VABER: Don't worry, you will. "
329,DOCTOR: You said just now that you were on some sort of mission. May
330,one ask what it is? 
331,"TARON: No, I can't tell you that. That's top secret. "
332,DOCTOR: As you wish. I'm on something of a special mission myself. 
333,"VABER: Taron, why can't you face it? "
334,TARON: Now listen 
335,VABER: None of us is ever going to get away from here. 
336,TARON: Vaber! 
337,"VABER: The radio's gone, the ship's damaged, we can't take off. We're"
338,on a suicide mission! 
339,TARON: It was your choice. Nobody made you come. 
340,"DOCTOR: Well, whatever it was you came here to do, it must be pretty"
341,important. 
342,TARON: We think so. 
343,DOCTOR: How many are there of you? 
344,TARON: There were seven. But our commander was killed on touchdown. And
345,we've lost three others since. 
346,"DOCTOR: Oh, only three left. "
347,TARON: Yeah. 
348,"DOCTOR: Well, you could make that four if you'd let me help you. Five"
349,with Jo Grant. 
350,TARON: Thanks. I'll think about it. 
351,DOCTOR: You still don't trust me? 
352,TARON: Why should I? You come here out of nowhere and then claim to be
353,something out of a legend. 
354,"DOCTOR: Yes, I see your point. But I am on your side, you know? "
355,(Codal returns.) 
356,VABER: Anything about? 
357,"CODAL: No, it seems quiet enough. "
358,TARON: You all right now? 
359,"DOCTOR: Yes, never felt better. "
360,"TARON: Good, we'll take you to your friend. "
361,DOCTOR: That's good. 
362,"TARON: After that, you're on your own. If you see me signal, dive for"
363,cover quickly and don't make a sound. Understood? 
364,DOCTOR: Understood. 
365,(Jo is lying on the spaceship floor. The fungus has grown half way up
366,her arm.)
367,
368, [Jungle]
369,
370,(Taron signals the group to get down. We hear a
371,vaguely metallic noise.) 
372,TARON: It's coming this way. It sounds like it's in trouble. What do
373,you think? 
374,VABER: It could be ray exhaustion. 
375,"CODAL: No, light wave sickness. That's what the others had. "
376,(There is a round depression in the ground nearby.) 
377,TARON: Do you think it's deactivated? 
378,"CODAL: Well, we can't be sure. "
379,VABER: Let's chance it. 
380,(The group moves forward a little.) 
381,DOCTOR: Spiridons? 
382,CODAL: Here. 
383,(Codal hands the Doctor and Taron an aerosol can each.) 
384,DOCTOR: What's this? Some kind of weapon? 
385,CODAL: A liquid colour spray. 
386,"TARON: Point it in this direction, press the control on top and you'll"
387,see what we're up against. 
388,(The two men spray paint into existence -) 
389,DOCTOR: Daleks! 
390, Episode Two
391,
392, [Jungle]
393,
394,(The Doctor shakes the overgrown pepperpot.) 
395,DOCTOR: Motive power nil. Total loss of vision. Sensor plates not
396,"functioning, and weaponry deactivated. "
397,TARON: You seem to know a good deal about Daleks. 
398,"DOCTOR: Yes, well I've had cause to. This one's something new. I've"
399,never come across Daleks that have mastered invisibility before. 
400,"VABER: They haven't mastered it, not completely. "
401,"CODAL: As far as we can tell, they can only stay invisible for very"
402,short periods. 
403,"TARON: Even so, it gives them quite an advantage. "
404,"DOCTOR: Yes, a terrifying advantage. Have you any idea how they do it? "
405,TARON: Codal's our scientist. 
406,CODAL: They discovered it by studying the Spiridons. It's an
407,anti-reflecting light wave. Their problem is that to create the energy
408,"required, they have to generate fantastic power, so they can't sustain"
409,it for very long. 
410,DOCTOR: I see. 
411,CODAL: I'd like to investigate a bit further. Let's lift off the top so
412,that 
413,"DOCTOR: No, don't do that. No, most Daleks have an automatic distress"
414,"call. Even when they're deactivated, the transmitter may keep"
415,functioning. 
416,"TARON: Thank you, Doctor. Let's go."
417,
418, [Spaceship]
419,
420," (Jo wakes and covers her arm with her jacket, then"
421,picks up the log recorder.) 
422,JO: My hand and. My hand and my arm are infected by something I can't
423,describe. It's spreading rapidly and my hand is already quite numb.
424,
425, [Jungle]
426,
427," TARON: You wait here, Doctor. Codal and I will"
428,scout ahead. We won't be long. 
429,DOCTOR: Taron seems very cautious. 
430,VABER: Too cautious. Things would be different if Miro was still alive.
431,
432,DOCTOR: Oh? Who is Miro. 
433,VABER: Expedition commander. He was killed when we landed. 
434,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sorry. And Taron, who's he? "
435,VABER: Spacecraft doctor. Next in seniority so he took command. And a
436,fine mess he's making of it. 
437,"DOCTOR: Oh, do you think so? I thought he seemed to be doing rather"
438,well. 
439,VABER: Do you? Three more dead. Nothing achieved. Nothing even planned.
440,He'll go on being cautious until we're all killed. 
441,"DOCTOR: Well, what do you think he should do? "
442,"VABER: Oh, we've got explosives and weapons. We could attack the Dalek"
443,laboratory and wipe them all out. 
444,"DOCTOR: How many Daleks are there, do you know? "
445,"VABER: Well, as far as I know, there's not more than twelve. Just a"
446,"scientific group, here to try and learn the technique of invisibility."
447,One determined attack and we could destroy them all. 
448,"DOCTOR: Tell me about these creatures that live here, the Spiridons."
449,Are they invisible at all times? 
450,VABER: As far as I know. 
451,DOCTOR: Are they working with the Daleks? 
452,(A tentacle is moving through the grass.) 
453,VABER: I imagine they've been totally subjugated. The usual Dalek
454,technique of rule by terror. 
455,DOCTOR: Mass exterminations followed by absolute suppression of the
456,survivors. I know. 
457,VABER: I hate all this waiting round. I wish he'd get back and we could
458,get started. 
459,"(The tentacle closes in on Vaber. Meanwhile, Taron and Codal take cover"
460,as a Dalek patrol glides past.) 
461,TARON: Probably going out to recover the one we found. 
462,CODAL: That's a pity. 
463,"TARON: Let's check out the area in that direction, then get back to the"
464,others. 
465,CODAL: Yeah. 
466,"(As the tentacle closes in on Vaber, the Doctor is checking out the"
467,pitcher plants and how they follow movement.) 
468,DOCTOR: Fascinating. 
469,VABER: The eyeplants? 
470,DOCTOR: Mmm. 
471,VABER: They've come in very useful. 
472,"DOCTOR: Oh, how? "
473,VABER: They get very agitated whenever an invisible Spiridon comes near
474,"them. It's given us a, well, a kind of early warning system. "
475,(Vaber cries out. He is entwined in the tentacle.) 
476,DOCTOR: Vaber! 
477,VABER: Get my knife! 
478,"DOCTOR: Hang on! Just hang on! I got it! Quickly, your hand. Let go!"
479,Let it go! Let it go. 
480,(The Doctor severs the tentacle and the plant/animal screams and
481,withdraws it.) 
482,TARON: What happened? 
483,"DOCTOR: Oh, it's all right. Nothing much. Just that some sort of"
484,tentacle tried to make a breakfast of our friend here. 
485,TARON: Vaber? 
486,VABER: I'm all right. 
487,TARON: Are you sure? 
488,"VABER: I said I'm all right! Thanks, Doctor. "
489,DOCTOR: My pleasure. Made an interesting little object lesson. 
490,VABER: What do you mean? 
491,"DOCTOR: Well, just that it shows the need for continued caution, I"
492,think. 
493,VABER: You think I don't know that? I have been here rather longer than
494,you have. But danger's not going to scare me into doing nothing. 
495,TARON: Vaber. 
496,DOCTOR: There's a considerable difference between courage and reckless
497,"stupidity, you know. "
498,"VABER: If I have to die, I want it to be for a better reason than"
499,providing nourishment for a flesh eating tentacle. 
500,CODAL: The eye-plants are moving. 
501,"TARON: It's a Spiridon patrol! Quick, over there. "
502,"(Meanwhile, Jo leaves the spaceship and collapses. Hearing heavy"
503,"breathing she goes back into the spaceship, leaving the log recorder on"
504,the ground. Once inside she passes out. The Spiridon opens the hatch.) 
505,TARON: They're coming closer. 
506,"DOCTOR: Unless they change direction, they're bound to find us. "
507,VABER: Why wait? We're well armed. Let's attack now. 
508,TARON: Don't be stupid. There could be dozens of them. 
509,CODAL: I'll try and lead them off. 
510,"(And does so. As he dashes into the bamboo, the Spiridons follow.) "
511,TARON: Codal's given us a chance. Let's not waste it! 
512,"(Codal is caught by the Spiridons, his arms pulled behind his back."
513,Then he is hit over the head with a piece of wood.)
514,
515, [Jungle - landing site]
516,
517, (The Doctor finds the log recorder on the ground.)
518,
519,TARON: There's our ship. Your friend's inside. 
520,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
521,"VABER: Wait, something moving other side of the clearing. "
522,"TARON: Where? Quick, get through there. "
523,(The men take cover behind some vegetation and the Dalek patrol
524,enters.) 
525,DALEK: Primitive spacecraft of type originating on Skaro. Report
526,discovery to command centre. 
527,DALEK 2: Dalek patrol two calling command centre. We have located Thal
528,spacecraft. Indicate course of action. (pause) Command centre orders
529,the craft is to be destroyed. 
530,DALEK: Position to fire. 
531,DOCTOR: But Jo Grant's inside your ship. I've got to do something. 
532,TARON: There's nothing you can do. 
533,DALEK: Aim. 
534,DOCTOR: No! Wait! Wait. Somebody's still in there. 
535,DALEK: Save for interrogation. Disable. 
536,"(The Daleks fire and the Doctor falls, clutching his knees.) "
537,DALEK: Proceed as ordered. 
538,DOCTOR: No! No! 
539,"DALEK: Fire. Repeat, full power. "
540,(The Daleks set the spacecraft on fire.) 
541,DOCTOR: Jo. 
542,DALEK: Stand or we will exterminate you now. 
543,VABER: We've got to help him. 
544,TARON: There's nothing we can do. Nothing. 
545,DALEK: Walk! Walk! 
546,(The Daleks escort the Doctor away.) 
547,TARON: Let's get away from here.
548,
549, [Corridor]
550,
551, (The Doctor is in front of the patrol as they walk
552,along an enclosed corridor with occasional archways. His legs seem to
553,be better now.) 
554,DALEK: Wait. 
555,(The Dalek summons a lift.) 
556,DALEK: Walk. 
557,(The Doctor and one Dalek enter. 
558,[Lift]
559,
560,(The lift goes down.) 
561,DALEK: Walk!
562,
563, [Corridor]
564,
565, (There is less light down here. They walk on to a
566,door guarded by another Dalek.) 
567,DALEK: Halt. 
568,(The door opens.) 
569,DALEK: Enter.
570,
571, [Cell]
572,
573, CODAL: Doctor. 
574,"DOCTOR: Codal. So, they captured you too, did they? "
575,"CODAL: Where are the others, Taron and Vaber? "
576,"DOCTOR: Well, they're all right as far as I know. How are you? "
577,"CODAL: I'm fine. Splitting headache, but I'll survive. "
578,DOCTOR: That's good. 
579,"CODAL: Why didn't they kill us straight away, Doctor? "
580,"DOCTOR: Oh, I expect they're saving us for interrogation. They'll want"
581,"to know what we're doing on this planet. You know, what you did back"
582,"there, leading the searchers away from us, was very courageous. "
583,"CODAL: I just didn't give myself time to think. If I had, I certainly"
584,wouldn't have taken the risk. 
585,"DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know. I think you're doing yourself rather an"
586,"injustice there. If you hadn't acted the way you did, we'd have all"
587,been captured. They give medals for that sort of bravery. 
588,CODAL: Bravery? I've been terrified ever since I landed on this planet.
589,"It's different for Taron and Vaber, they're professionals. They've seen"
590,action before. 
591,DOCTOR: And do you think they're any the less brave because of that? 
592,CODAL: They know how to deal with fear. They're used to living close to
593,"death. I'm not. I'm a scientist, not an adventurer. "
594,"DOCTOR: Well, forgive me if I'm wrong, but aren't you a volunteer? "
595,CODAL: Yes. 
596,DOCTOR: Then you must have known what you were getting into? 
597,"CODAL: No. None of us did. We're not a warlike people, Doctor. We've"
598,only just developed space flight. No one had attempted a voyage of this
599,"length before, but every man and woman from my division volunteered."
600,"Over six hundred of them. You see, I didn't even have the courage to be"
601,the odd man out. What are you laughing at? 
602,"DOCTOR: Ah, you, my friend. You may be a very brilliant scientist but"
603,"you have very little understanding of people, particularly yourself."
604,"Courage isn't just a matter of not being frightened, you know. "
605,"CODAL: What is it, then? "
606,"DOCTOR: It's being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway, just as"
607,you did. 
608,"CODAL: I'm not convinced, but thanks anyway. "
609,"DOCTOR: Right, well, after that little tutorial on bravery, let's see"
610,if we can find a way of getting out of here. 
611,CODAL: Escape? 
612,"DOCTOR: Yes, escape. Well, let's take a look in our pockets and see if"
613,we can come up with something that might prove useful. Come on. Turn
614,'them out. Sonic screwdriver. 
615,CODAL: Battery. 
616,DOCTOR: Fancy hankie. 
617,(Tardis log recorder.) 
618,"JO : Shortly after entering the Tardis, the Doctor fell into a deep"
619,coma. 
620,CODAL: Wasn't that the girl we met? Your assistant? 
621,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. She'd gone to fetch help for me. The Daleks "
622,CODAL: Took her prisoner? 
623,"DOCTOR: No, they murdered her. "
624,JO : His respiration was very shallow and his skin icy to the
625,touch.
626,
627, [Cave]
628,
629, (Oh no they didn't. Jo is lying covered by a very
630,purple fake fur as a Spiridon mixes a concoction by pouring it from one
631,wooden bowl to another repeatedly. Jo wakes as the fur is pulled aside
632,and the invisible being speaks.) 
633,WESTER: Don't be afraid. I want to help you. 
634,JO: What are you doing? 
635,WESTER: You've been infected by the fungoids. This will clear it. 
636,(The concoction pours onto her arm.) 
637,JO: Where are we? 
638,WESTER: A cave near the city. I found you unconscious in a spacecraft
639,and brought you here. It was fortunate I found you in time. The machine
640,was destroyed shortly after by the Daleks. 
641,JO: Daleks! Daleks here? 
642,WESTER: You did not know? 
643,JO: Who are you? Why did you help me? There's so much I want to ask you
644,"but I don't know where to start, where to begin. "
645,WESTER: All in good time. You must rest while the potion is taking
646,"effect. When you're feeling better, I'll tell you everything I can. "
647,(Jo falls asleep.)
648,
649, [Cell]
650,
651, (The Doctor runs the sonic screwdriver around the
652,edge of the cell door.) 
653,"DOCTOR: No, that's hopeless. If there's one thing the Daleks are very"
654,"good at making, that is locks. "
655,"CODAL: Well, what now? If we can't even get the door open? "
656,"DOCTOR: Well, we'll just have to start our escape when the door's"
657,already open. 
658,CODAL: But they'll be a Dalek standing outside. 
659,"DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. So, we're not trying to deal with a door, we're"
660,trying to deal with a Dalek. 
661,CODAL: How? 
662,"DOCTOR: How. That's a very good question. How. Well, there must"
663,something here that could prove useful. 
664,CODAL: There's nothing that I can see. 
665,"DOCTOR: Come on, come on. We've got to think of something. "
666,"CODAL: Well, the one thing we have got is time. "
667,"DOCTOR: On the contrary, my friend, the Daleks don't intend to let us"
668,"rot down here, you know."
669,
670, [Control room]
671,
672, (A bevy of Daleks stand on a raised walkway as
673,another enters and goes over to one standing amongst equipment.) 
674,LEADER: Report. 
675,"DALEK: Section three requests that after interrogation, prisoners"
676,should be transferred to their laboratory. 
677,LEADER: State reasons. 
678,DALEK: They are required for experiments of light ray emissions on
679,living tissue. 
680,LEADER: Agreed. Next. 
681,DALEK: Central control report that only two Thals are still at liberty.
682,Their capture is expected shortly.

684, [Jungle]
685,
686, (Taron and Vaber are checking their small
687,"explosives dump, which is safely wrapped in plastic.) "
688,"TARON: Well, at least these haven't been found, that's something. "
689,"VABER: There's enough explosive here to take care of fifty Daleks,"
690,"never mind twelve. Come on, Taron, we'll take a chance, rush the main"
691,"entrance. If we can make it down that first tunnel, the blast from"
692,"these will cave in the whole section, bury the Daleks. "
693,TARON: And if we don't make it down that tunnel? 
694,"VABER: Oh, come on, Taron! What's the matter with you? When we came on"
695,"this mission, you knew there'd be risks. Well let's start taking them! "
696,"TARON: We make our move when we have a chance of succeeding, not"
697,before. 
698,VABER: Give me the explosives. 
699,TARON: No. 
700,"VABER: Get them out! I mean it, Taron. I'll kill you if I have to. "
701,TARON: That's the only way you'll get them. 
702,(Vaber cocks his weapon.) 
703,VABER: I mean it. 
704,(There's a sound of rushing wind. The two men duck as debris hurtles
705,"past them, then there is a series of booms.) "
706,TARON: What's that? A spaceship coming in too fast? Burning up.
707,
708, [Cell]
709,
710, DOCTOR: A tiny motor with an electric power
711,"source. That's it. Yes. Yes, I'll dismantle the circuitry, reverse the"
712,polarity and convert to a low power receiver transmitter with a
713,positive feedback. 
714,CODAL: That's right. The Dalek's guidance system functions by means of
715,high frequency radio impulses. 
716,"DOCTOR: Correct, and if we can jam them "
717,CODAL: It should give them quite a headache. 
718,DOCTOR: It should give them quite a brainstorm. Give me your
719,screwdriver.
720,
721, [Cave]
722,
723, (Jo is awake and her arm is clean.) 
724,WESTER: All trace of the infection has gone. Your arm will be sore for
725,"a few days, but that's all. "
726,JO: Thank you. I'm very grateful to you. Tell me some more about your
727,planet. 
728,"WESTER: Before the Daleks invaded, they bombarded the planet with"
729,"bacteria. Only a handful of my people survived. When the Daleks landed,"
730,we could offer no resistance. Those that were left were forced to
731,cooperate with the Daleks. 
732,JO: But you don't? 
733,"WESTER: No. There are a few of us, not many, who do what we can to"
734,"fight back, and that's little enough. "
735,JO: Why did the Daleks invade you? What did they want? 
736,"WESTER: To master our techniques of invisibility, and they seem very"
737,close to doing it. 
738,JO: Is there no way of stopping them? 
739,WESTER: They're too powerful. I had hoped the aliens from the
740,"spacecraft might help us, but there are so few of them. Two more were"
741,captured today. 
742,JO: You've seen them? 
743,"WESTER: When they were taken to the city. A tall fair haired man, and"
744,"later, one with silver hair, also tall, wearing strange clothes. "
745,JO: The Doctor! Oh! Where is he? 
746,WESTER: You know him? 
747,"JO: Well, yes. And I thought "
748,WESTER: He's imprisoned in the city. 
749,JO: Well then we must find a way of helping him. Get him out! 
750,"WESTER: There is no way. The Daleks will interrogate him, and then use"
751,him in their experiments. He'd be better off dead.
752,
753, [Jungle]
754,
755, (Taron and Vaber make their way through smoke
756,towards the sound of flames.) 
757,VABER: Something moving. 
758,(It is a blond Thal woman.) 
759,"TARON: Rebec! Rebec! Rebec, are you all right? "
760,REBEC: I think so. Our flight angle was too steep and we came in too
761,"fast. We were lucky to get out alive. All the equipment, the"
762,"explosives, everything gone. "
763,TARON: Are you the only survivor? 
764,"REBEC: No, Maret and Latep, they're following. "
765,TARON: But why did you come? 
766,REBEC: Communications intercepted another Dalek space signal. We had to
767,warn you. 
768,TARON: Warn us? What about? 
769,REBEC: Do you know the strength of the Dalek force here? 
770,"TARON: Well, it's no more than a dozen. "
771,REBEC: The signal we intercepted was to Dalek Supreme Command. It
772,stated that the force assembled on Spiridon was now complete. It gave
773,"their numbers. Well, somewhere on this planet there are ten thousand"
774,Daleks! 
775, Episode Three
776,
777, [Jungle]
778,
779, TARON: Are you fit to move? We must find the
780,others quickly. They're bound to send a patrol to investigate the
781,crash. 
782,"REBEC: With any luck, they might think there were no survivors. "
783,"(Vaber brings in two more young men, coughing from the smoke.) "
784,"TARON: Maret, Latep, are you all right? "
785,LATEP: Just shaken. We came down with a bang. 
786,MARAT: I'm all right. 
787,TARON: Good. We must move. It's not fit to stay here. 
788,REBEC: Do you have a plan? 
789,"TARON: Yes. Yes, I think so. "
790,VABER: We'd better get a move on. We haven't got much time.

792, [Outside the city entrance]
793,
794," (Jo and Wester hide in bushes, watching large"
795,purple-furred creatures pushing containers through the large doors. Two
796,Daleks stand guard.) 
797,JO: Is this the only way into the city? 
798,WESTER: Yes. 
799,JO: Somehow I've got to find a way of getting past those Dalek guards. 
800,"WESTER: Even if you could, what would you do once you got in there? "
801,"JO: Well, find the Doctor and try to rescue him. "
802,"WESTER: Ah. Those are my people, the Spiridons. The Daleks have made"
803,them slaves. 
804,JO: But I can see them now. 
805,WESTER: You see the furs they wear to protect them from the cold. 
806,JO: What are they taking into the city? 
807,WESTER: Samples of our vegetation. The Daleks are experimenting with
808,plant-destroying bacteria. 
809,"JO: Now, if I could hide in one of those bundles. "
810,WESTER: You can't risk it. 
811,"JO: Look, if I got into the city, where's the most likely place they'd"
812,be holding the Doctor? 
813,"WESTER: In the lower levels, most certain. Deep, deep down. "
814,JO: I'm going to try it.
815,
816, [Cell]
817,
818, CODAL: Doctor? 
819,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
820,"CODAL: If this jamming device of yours works, we'll have a weapon that"
821,we can use against all the Daleks. We can give the lot of them
822,brainstorms. 
823,"DOCTOR: No, I'm afraid not, Codal. You see, the Daleks armour acts as a"
824,"sort of shield, so we've got to get in very close. In any case, the"
825,effect will only be temporary. 
826,"CODAL: Well, how long will it last then? "
827,"DOCTOR: Well, if we're lucky, long enough to get away. That is, if "
828,CODAL: If what? 
829,DOCTOR: If it works.
830,
831, [Tunnel entrance]
832,
833, (A small entrance is cut into a rock face with
834,liquid on it. Rebec touches it.) 
835,REBEC: It's freezing! 
836,"TARON: Yeah, it's an allotrope of ice. "
837,REBEC: A what? 
838,"TARON: Well, it's a form of ice that never gets hard. Codal is"
839,"convinced that the core of this whole planet is a mass of it, because"
840,every once in a while the pressure builds up and the whole thing bursts
841,to the surface. 
842,REBEC: Like a volcano? 
843,"TARON: Yeah, but instead of white hot lava, this erupts with molten"
844,"ice. We've seen it, tremendous explosions. The ice covers the jungle"
845,for miles around. 
846,MARAT: Are there many of these outlets? 
847,"TARON: Yes, dozens of them, but this is the nearest one to the city. "
848,"REBEC: Yes, but why is it important to us? "
849,"TARON: Ah, well, when they built the city, they used this ice volcano"
850,to provide a cooling system. They drove shafts out to meet the natural
851,fissures. 
852,MARAT: So if we could find the junctions we could get right inside the
853,city. 
854,"TARON: That's the theory anyway. Trouble is, we don't know if the"
855,shafts will stay wide enough to crawl through and we'll have no idea
856,which tunnel to follow. 
857,REBEC: And if the ice erupts when we're in there? 
858,(Vaber enters.) 
859,VABER: I've left the rest of the explosives in a safe hiding place. 
860,TARON: Good. 
861,"VABER: I've marked the position, just in case. "
862,(Vaber gives Taron the map. He then hands it to Marat.) 
863,TARON: Switch on your heating units. It's going to be cold in there.
864,You two get started. 
865,(Marat and Rebec crawl into the tunnel.) 
866,"TARON: Vaber, Latep, remember, positions by the main entrance to the"
867,"city. If we manage to cause a diversion, you attack. "
868,"VABER: Right. Er, Taron, about what happened, I'm "
869,TARON: Forget it. 
870,(Taron crawls into the tunnel.)
871,
872, [Cell]
873,
874," DOCTOR: Oh, well, that's it. That's the best that"
875,I can do. There's only one thing we need now. 
876,CODAL: What's that? 
877,DOCTOR: A Dalek to try it out on.

879, [Jungle]
880,
881, (Two fur covered Spiridons leave a container half
882,full of vegetation and go to collect more.) 
883,"WESTER: Quickly, now. (Jo runs over and gets into the container,"
884,covering herself with vegetation. The Spiridons return and start
885,"pushing the container away, and into the city.)"

888,
889, (The three Thals crawl along on hands and knees.
890,They stop at a junction and Taron hugs Rebec.) 
891,"REBEC: Oh, it's so cold. My heating unit's turned to maximum but I'm"
892,still freezing. 
893,MARAT: How far do you think we've come? 
894,TARON: It's hard to tell. We should strike one of the cooling ducts
895,soon. 
896,"(There is a rumbling, cracking noise.) "
897,REBEC: What's that? 
898,TARON: I don't know. Just keep moving. 
899,"MARAT: Taron, could be the start of an eruption, couldn't it? "
900,TARON: It's possible. 
901,MARAT: Then let's get back while we still have time. 
902,"TARON: No, if it's coming, we're already too late. We've no chance of"
903,getting to the surface in time. Our only chance is to strike one of the
904,shafts and quickly!

916, CODAL: I can hear the lift. There's one coming. 
917,DOCTOR: Come sit here. Now remember what I told you. Get in close so

919,CODAL: Right. 
920,(The Dalek opens the door and enters.) 
921,DALEK: Prisoners will stand. 
922,(The Doctor stops Codal from rising. The Dalek moves further into the
923,cell.) 
924,DALEK: Prisoners will stand! 
925,DOCTOR: Now! 
926,(Codal ducks under its 'arm' and holds them upwards while the Doctor
927,goes round the back.) 
928,DALEK: Surrender or you will be exterminated! 
929,DOCTOR: Hold on! Hold it! 
930,(The Doctor puts the log recorder on the Dalek's lid.) 
931,DOCTOR: Mind yourself. Hold on to it! Hold on to it! 
932,(The Dalek spins round. 
933,CODAL: I can't! 
934,DOCTOR: Hold it! 
935,"(They are both thrown off as the Dalek continues spinning, screaming."
936,Then it slams into the wall and goes quiet.) 
937,CODAL: That little machine of yours has quite an effect. 
938,DOCTOR: Had quite an effect. 
939,(It has fallen off the Dalek and broken.) 
940,"DOCTOR: Not any more, I'm afraid. You know, for a man who abhors"
941,"violence, I must say I took great satisfaction in doing that. Right,"
942,let's get on. We may be out of the cell but we're a long way from being
943,free.

963,"three Thals. Just past a junction, an ice wall cracks and starts to"

989,well light level. They walk forward then spot a Dalek in a recess.)

992,DOCTOR: Back to the lift!

998,"operating it by remote control. Well, there's only one thing for it,"
999,we'll have to go down. 
1000,(But there is a Dalek waiting there too.) 
1001,CODAL: Shut the doors! 
1002,(The Dalek's weapon fire scorches the back wall.) 
1003,DOCTOR: That was close. 
1004,"CODAL: If they keep driving us down to the lower levels, we'll never"
1005,get out. 
1006,"DOCTOR: Presumably that's their intention. Still, we haven't much"
1007,"alternative, have we? Let's try another level. "
1008,"CODAL: Let me go first, Doctor. At least I've got this. (a"
1009,weapon) 
1010,DOCTOR: Thank you very much. 
1011,(There are no Daleks waiting on this level. They walk along a corridor
1012,and past a grill which the Doctor glances at.)

1024,"DOCTOR: I know it's not the moment to ask how you got in there, but I'd"
1025,be fascinated to know how. 
1026,TARON: Help me free this grill! Hurry! The ice is moving up behind us! 
1027,"DOCTOR: Push it up! Use your knife. Right, now lever it down, lever it"
1028,"down. Right, now push! That's it!"

1043,CODAL: I can't hold it. 
1044,DOCTOR: You must! Pull! 
1045,(Suddenly the shutter motor stops and they fly open again.) 
1046,DOCTOR: Come on. Put your leg here. 
1047,(Rebec climbs down then Taron and finally Marat.) 
1048,CODAL: Look! 
1049,(The shadow of a Dalek appears on the corridor wall.) 
1050,"DOCTOR: Out of here! Quick! Out! Come on, get him out of here! "

1090,the map on Marat.)

1093,a patrol immediately. Locate explosives and destroy. 
1094,DALEK 2: I obey. 
1095,DALEK: Report.

1101," CODAL: Well, they won't open that in a hurry. "
1102,"DOCTOR: Never underestimate the Daleks, Codal. They won't let a little"
1103,matter of a metal door delay them for long. 
1104,REBEC: Doctor? 
1105,DOCTOR: Yes? 
1106,REBEC: Looks as if all Marat's courage was for nothing. There's no
1107,other door. 
1108,DOCTOR: Oh. I don't know whether I've locked the Daleks out or
1109,ourselves in. 
1110,TARON: Have a look at this. 
1111,(Large orange slats across the wall.) 
1112,TARON: What do you make of it? 
1113,"DOCTOR: Well, if it wasn't for the fact that it doesn't make sense, I'd"
1114,say it was a gigantic refrigeration unit. 
1115,"TARON: Yes, it's big enough to freeze an ocean. "
1116,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1117,REBEC: But why? All their cooling needs are taken care of by the ice
1118,tunnels. 
1119,(The Daleks are working on the door. The Doctor stands under a large
1120,shaft in the middle of the ceiling.) 
1121,DOCTOR: What's this? 
1122,"TARON: Well, it's a ventilator shaft. Carries out the hot gases from"
1123,the unit. 
1124,"DOCTOR: Right, that's it then. "
1125,TARON: What do you mean? Nobody could climb that. 
1126,DOCTOR: You're probably right. Nevertheless it does lead up to the
1127,"surface, doesn't it? "
1128,CODAL: Shush! Something's happening outside. 
1129,(A Dalek with a cutting arm has arrived.) 
1130,"TARON: They're cutting through. Doctor? Doctor, they're cutting through"
1131,the door. 
1132,"DOCTOR: Well, it's pretty obvious they'd do something of the sort. "
1133,"TARON: Well, what are we going to do? "
1134,"DOCTOR: Nothing. When faced with the inevitable, don't waste precious"
1135,"time by resisting it. Now, what would you say the tensile strength of"
1136,this material is?
1137,
1138, [Control room]
1139,
1140, (Jo hides behind the control desk as the Dalek
1141,with the map reports to another one.)

1143,explosives. We are to proceed to the area and destroy them.

1147, (Everyone is tying a rope to each corner of a
1148,large sheet of plastic.)

1150,"CODAL: Well, we're certainly not going to float out of here. "
1151,"DOCTOR: Huh. That's precisely what we are going to do. Come with me,"
1152,Taron. I want to show you something. 
1153,"TARON: Hurry up, Doctor, it's pretty hot in here. "
1154,"DOCTOR: Yes, exactly, but if we can turn the refrigeration unit up to"
1155,"maximum, the updraft will be hotter and even more powerful. Now look at"
1156,this. 
1157,(The Doctor lets go of a piece of paper. It floats upwards.) 
1158,TARON: So? Hot air rises. 
1159,"DOCTOR: Exactly. And if we can trap enough of it, we might be able to"
1160,rise with it. 
1161,TARON: Fantastic. Will it work? 
1162,DOCTOR: I've no idea. We haven't got much choice. TARON: Let's get on
1163,with it. 
1164,"(Meanwhile, the cutting Dalek is has moved on from the vertical to the"
1165,"horizontal, and Jo has followed the Dalek patrol out of the city.) "
1166,CODAL: Pull your end out. 
1167,REBEC: Right. 
1168,(They hold up the plastic as the Doctor turns up the heat. The cutting
1169,Dalek is on the second vertical of the doorway.) REBEC: It's beginning

1188,"TARON: Come on, Doctor. "
1189,CODAL: Grab that. 
1190,(The Doctor puts his foot in the loop on his rope and they all drop to
1191,the floor.)

1193,CODAL: There's not enough lift to take all our weight.

1204,TARON: It's going. 
1205,(The Daleks finally burst in as their feet disappear up the shaft.)

1209, [Cooling shaft]
1210,
1211, TARON: How far have we come?

1225,TARON: Just keep your eyes closed and hang on tight. You'll be all
1226,right. 
1227,CODAL: Any idea how far to the surface? 
1228,"DOCTOR: Miles, I should think. Don't forget we started at the lowest"
1229,"level of the city. Should be a long, slow haul."
1230,
1231, [Cooling chamber]
1232,
1233, DALEK: A patrol will ascend to surface level and
1234,proceed immediately to the point where the shaft emerges. Patrol will
1235,require to travel at maximum speed to reach the point before prisoners
1236,escape. An anti-gravitational disc is to be brought here at once.

1243,"(The Dalek with the map moves towards Jo's position, then turns back as"
1244,the other two remove a rock from in front of the explosives.) 
1245,DALEK: The explosives are equipped with detonating mechanisms. 
1246,DALEK 2: We will detonate them here. Activate mechanism. 
1247,DALEK: All mechanisms primed. The bombs will self-detonate. 
1248,DALEK 2: We will return to the city. 
1249,(Pebbles and soil fall down on the Daleks. They leave. Jo goes to the

1334,"JO: No, I wasn't. "
1335,DOCTOR: But you were. 
1336,"JO: No, I wasn't. Look, Doctor, what's been happening? Where've you"
1337,been? 
1338,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a long story and there were a few moments that were"
1339,a trifle worrying 
1340,CODAL: A trifle worrying? 
1341,"DOCTOR: You know Codal and Taron, don't you? "
1342,JO: Yes. 
1343,DOCTOR: I don't think you've met Rebec. 
1344,JO: Hello. 
1345,REBEC: Hello. 
1346,"JO: Look, Doctor, the last I'd heard about you, you'd been captured by"
1347,"the Daleks, right "
1348,"DOCTOR: Yeah, but "
1349,JO: And I was told that they were going to take you 
1350,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know that "
1351,JO: Because they're doing all these experiments 
1352,"DOCTOR: All right, all right, Jo "
1353,JO: And then I thought you were going to be in them and I didn't know
1354,what I was going to do 
1355,"DOCTOR: Jo! Jo! Jo! Please? Look, will you excuse us for a moment? My"
1356,friend has rather a lot to tell me about. 
1357,"TARON: Yes, of course. "
1358,"JO: Doctor, wait till you hear what happened to me. It was terrible,"
1359,and then I got rescued by this bowl. 
1360,REBEC: You might say you're glad to see me. 
1361,TARON: I might. Why did you come? 
1362,REBEC: I was part of the back up crew. I was trained and ready. I had
1363,no choice. 
1364,TARON: That's not true. There were dozens of other people trained to
1365,the same state of readiness as you. You could have backed out. 
1366,"REBEC: Why should I? I wanted to come on the first landing, and you"
1367,"made sure I was kept out of your crew. So when the chance came, I took"
1368,it. 
1369,"CODAL: Look, I think one of us ought to keep watch. I'll take the first"
1370,stretch. 
1371,TARON: You shouldn't have come. 
1372,"REBEC: Now I'm here, we're together again. And there's nothing you can"
1373,do about it. 
1374,TARON: But don't you realise what you've done? Can't you see the
1375,"position you've put me in? I mean, not counting Jo and the Doctor,"
1376,there's only five of us left now. Five of us out of two missions. And
1377,somehow we've got to achieve what we set out to do. We must destroy the
1378,Daleks! 
1379,REBEC: And how does my being here change that? 
1380,TARON: Because. Because I love you. I can't convert you into a cypher.
1381,"But from now on, every judgment I make will be clouded. I'll even"
1382,hesitate to take the right risks because I'll be worrying about you. 
1383,REBEC: I'm sorry. I didn't think of it like that. I didn't understand. 
1384,"TARON: Well, you might understand this. Your being here might be the"

1390,aliens. Temperatures falling rapidly. 
1391,LEADER: The search will continue. 
1392,DALEK: I obey. 
1393,LEADER: Supreme Command has decreed that we prepare a bacteriological
1394,culture that will destroy all living tissue. Daleks and Spiridon slave
1395,workers will be given immunity to the disease. 
1396,"DALEK: If the aliens are not taken, the bacteria is to be released."
1397,"Without immunity, no living thing can survive the disease. All will be"
1398,exterminated!

1400, [Jungle]
1401,
1402," DOCTOR: But, Jo, why on earth didn't you stay in"
1403,the Tardis? We'd have been safe there. 
1404,"JO: Well, Doctor, you didn't look very safe. Well, I thought you were"
1405,dying and I went out to try and find some help for you. 
1406,"DOCTOR: On a planet full of Daleks? Well, surely I warned you? "
1407,"JO: Well, Doctor, you didn't tell me anything. You just rushed into the"
1408,"Tardis, you rattled off some sort of a message and, well, then you"
1409,flaked out. 
1410,DOCTOR: Did I? 
1411,JO: Uh huh. 
1412,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sorry, Jo. I'm afraid I wasn't myself. "
1413,JO: Doctor? What did you say to the Time Lords in your message? 
1414,"DOCTOR: Well, I told them about the Dalek spaceship leaving the Ogron"
1415,planet and told them to send the Tardis after it. 
1416,JO: But what are the Daleks doing on this planet? 
1417,"DOCTOR: They've got an army based here, Jo, the mightiest army of"
1418,Daleks there's ever been. 
1419,"JO: But when we were on the Ogron planet, we put a stop to their plan"
1420,to sort of cause a war? 
1421,"DOCTOR: Well, evidently that was only part of their plan, to make their"
1422,"conquest easier perhaps. With an army this size, we now know they"
1423,intend to invade the galaxy anyway unless we can stop them. 
1424,JO: Just us? 
1425,DOCTOR: And our Thal friends. Oh dear. Perhaps a female shoulder to cry
1426,on might come in handy. 
1427,JO: Right. 
1428,"DOCTOR: Give it a try, will you? "
1429,JO: Yes. 
1430,(Jo goes and talks to Rebec while the Doctor goes over to Taron.) 
1431,DOCTOR: The load getting a little heavy? 
1432,TARON: I don't think I'm equipped to handle all this any more. 
1433,"DOCTOR: Oh, why? Just because you've found out that you're not made of"
1434,stone? 
1435,TARON: This job doesn't allow for human weakness. 
1436,"DOCTOR: Then they should have sent a machine, shouldn't they. "
1437,TARON: I thought they had. I was wrong. 
1438,"DOCTOR: Good, because the business of command is not for a machine, is"
1439,"it? The moment that we forget that we're dealing with people, then"
1440,we're no better off than the machines that we came here to destroy.
1441,"When we start acting and thinking like the Daleks, Taron, the battle is"
1442,lost. 
1443,TARON: Someone coming! 
1444,CODAL: Look who I found. 
1445,TARON: What happened to you? 
1446,VABER: What happened to you? We saw the ice eruption and assumed you
1447,hadn't made it. 
1448,LATEP: We went to the entrance of the city anyway. 
1449,"VABER: I wanted to take the chance, make a rush, but we found our bomb"
1450,was faulty. 
1451,"LATEP: So we had to go back to get the other bombs, to find some Daleks"
1452,had been there before us and blown themselves up. 
1453,"JO: Well, I managed to get two of the bombs before that. I've hidden"
1454,them. 
1455,"DOCTOR: Well done, Jo. If those two are all right, we at least have a"
1456,chance. 
1457,TARON: We must move on. It'll be dark soon. 
1458,"CODAL: And cold. You haven't experienced a full Spiridon night, Doctor."
1459,You don't know what cold is until you have. 
1460,DOCTOR: Then we must find shelter. 
1461,"VABER: Right, but not here. There are Daleks and Spiridon slave workers"
1462,making a terrific sweep across the jungle not that far behind us. 
1463,"TARON: Well, prepare to move. We'll go to the plain of stones. "
1464,JO: Plain of stones? 
1465,CODAL: It's an area of huge boulders. They absorb the heat of the sun
1466,and then discharge it at night. 
1467,"DOCTOR: You know, this planet never ceases to amaze me. First we find a"
1468,gigantic refrigerator and now night storage heaters. It really sounds
1469,quite luxurious. 
1470,"CODAL: Not exactly, Doctor. All the animal life from the jungle goes"
1471,there as well. 
1472,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's nice. Right, let's get going. Jo, where did you hide"
1473,the bombs? 
1474,JO: I'll get them. 
1475,LATEP: Let me help you. 
1476,JO: They're here. 
1477,LATEP: We haven't met properly. I am Latep. 
1478,JO: I'm Jo. How do you do? Uh oh. You don't know about a handshake.
1479,"Well, you see, it's an old Earth custom. We clasp hands like that and"
1480,it shows that we're good friends and that we're pleased to meet one
1481,another. Come on.
1482,
1483, [Jungle] 
1484, (Night is falling. Daleks and fur covered
1485,Spiridons walk past.) 
1486,DOCTOR: (sotto) What are those animals? 
1487,"CODAL: (sotto) They're not animals, Doctor. Spiridons. They wear those"
1488,furs against the cold. 
1489,DOCTOR: (sotto) That's good. At least we can see them now. Did you
1490,"notice anything peculiar about the Daleks, Jo? "
1491,JO: Not particularly. Why? 
1492,DOCTOR: Only that their movements seem to be slower. 
1493,"LATEP: Well, fast enough to kill us on sight, Doctor. "
1494,CODAL: Almost as though their mechanical reflexes weren't functioning
1495,properly. 
1496,"DOCTOR: Yes, but the reason. The reason is the important thing. "
1497,CODAL: They're out of range now. I think we can chance a move. 
1498,"JO: Come on, let's do it. I'm freezing!"
1499,
1500, [Plain of Stones] 
1501, (Large fangs of rock stick up through the ground.
1502,The group sit with their backs to them. Something with large wings
1503,flaps and shrieks above.) 
1504,REBEC: What was that? 
1505,"TARON: I don't know. We've heard them before. Never seen them. Latep,"
1506,take first guard. Doctor? 
1507,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, of course. "
1508,TARON: Do you mind? 
1509,"DOCTOR: Come on, Jo. Come and keep me company. "
1510,JO: All right. 
1511,(Jo and the Doctor leave.) 
1512,"VABER: I hate this running and hiding. We need to attack, and soon. "
1513,TARON: I'll decide when and how. 
1514,VABER: You've been putting off this attack since we got here. What do
1515,"you want, a guarantee of safety? "
1516,"TARON: No, I just want the best possible guarantee of success. Any"
1517,attempt that fails is worth nothing. 
1518,(Vaber leaves.) 
1519,"TARON: Codal, that giant refrigeration unit. What did you make of it? "
1520,CODAL: It was neutron powered 
1521,TARON: Yeah 
1522,CODAL: Could run for a thousand years. I'm convinced that somehow it's
1523,vital to the Dalek's survival. 
1524,TARON: Why do they need such low temperatures? 
1525,"CODAL: I can't answer that, but I am sure that refrigeration unit is"
1526,the key to our attack. 
1527,"VABER: Are you saying is we destroy the refrigeration plant, we destroy"
1528,the Daleks? 
1529,"CODAL: Yes. Yes, I think it would wipe them out. "
1530,VABER: Then that's it. That's the way we do it. We go in through the
1531,"shaft you came out of. Or better still, we lower the bombs down. "
1532,TARON: The Daleks wouldn't have left the top of that shaft unguarded. 
1533,"VABER: We think about that when we get there. If we leave now, we can"
1534,be there before light. 
1535,"TARON: We'll attack, but this has to be planned. Until it is, we'll"
1536,wait. 
1537,VABER: Wait! Wait! That's all we've heard from you. Why don't you face
1538,"it, Taron? Admit what we all know. Be honest. You're afraid. Miro would"
1539,"have taken action by now. He was a real commander, and he wouldn't have"
1540,had her hanging around our necks! 
1541,(Taron and Vaber fight. Codal tries to pull them apart as Vaber draws
1542,his weapon.) 
1543,CODAL: Latep! 
1544,(Taron disarms Vaber.) 
1545,"TARON: I am still in command here, and like it or not, you will obey"
1546,"orders. And believe me, Vaber, if you don't, I shan't hesitate to kill"
1547,"you. Now let's all get some rest. Latep, go back to your post."
1548,
1549, [Laboratory] 
1550,(The Laboratory is just off the Control room.) 
1551,DALEK: The bacteria are multiplying. 
1552,DALEK 2: We have calculated that after the release of the culture into
1553,"the atmosphere, it will totally contaminate the planet within the space"
1554,of one Spiridon day. 
1555,DALEK: All plant life will wither and die. 
1556,DALEK 2: All unimmunised animal life will die within one hour of
1557,inhaling the contaminated air. 
1558,LEADER: Approved. Continue with preparations. 
1559,DALEK: The most virulent form of the bacteria will be ready for release
1560,in half a Spiridon day.
1561,
1562, [Control room] 
1563, LEADER: Report. 
1564,DALEK 3: Spiridon slaves report aliens believed to be hiding at the
1565,Plain of Stones. 
1566,LEADER: Order all search units into that area. 
1567,DALEK 3: I obey.
1568,
1569, [Plain of Stones] 
1570, TARON: (sotto) Latep! Doctor! Codal. Codal!
1571,Where's Vaber? 
1572,CODAL: He was sitting over there. 
1573,"TARON: Doctor, the bombs have gone. "
1574,DOCTOR: What? 
1575,CODAL: He left this. 
1576,TARON: (reads) I'll do what I have to do alone. 
1577,DOCTOR: He doesn't stand a chance. 
1578,TARON: That's the last of the explosives. 
1579,CODAL: We've got to stop him. 
1580,"TARON: I intend to. Codal, will you come with me? Doctor, would you"
1581,stay here? 
1582,DOCTOR: If that's what you want. 
1583,TARON: Thanks. 
1584,CODAL: He'll be heading for the ventilator shaft. 
1585,"TARON: Yeah. We'll be back as soon as we can. Latep, stay here. Come"
1586,on. 
1587,"REBEC: Be careful, Taron. "
1588,(Taron and Codal leave.) 
1589,DOCTOR: Have you still got your guns with you? 
1590,REBEC: Yes. 
1591,"DOCTOR: That's good. Keep them handy, will you? Look around you. "
1592,"(Multicoloured pairs of lights are watching. Meanwhile, Vaber crashes"
1593,"through the bamboo carrying the bombs, and walks right into a group of"
1594,Spiridons.) 
1595,SPIRIDON: Take him to the Daleks. 
1596, Episode Five
1597,
1598, [Jungle] 
1599, (Vaber and the bombs are taken away by the
1600,Spiridons. Taron and Codal watch.) 
1601,TARON: They've got Vaber. 
1602,CODAL: And the bombs! 
1603,TARON: We must get them.
1604,
1605, [Plain of Stones]
1606,
1607, REBEC: What sort of creatures are they? 
1608,"DOCTOR: I've no idea, but whatever they are, they're moving in closer. "
1609,REBEC: I'll try a shot at them. 
1610,(Rebec fires. There is a yowl then the eyes disappear.) 
1611,LATEP: They've gone. It scared them off. 
1612,"DOCTOR: Yes, but they don't stay scared for long, do they? "
1613,(The eyes come back on. Rebec fires again.) 
1614,LATEP: Let them get in closer. 
1615,REBEC: That's the last of my charges. 
1616,LATEP: And I've only two left.
1617,
1618, [Jungle] 
1619, (Taron and Codal jump the last Spiridon in the
1620,procession and beat it over the head with a large wooden stick. They
1621,pull off the fur.) 
1622,TARON: Help me into this. 
1623,CODAL: All right. 
1624,"TARON: Let's see if we can get in there. Now listen, I'll try to get"
1625,close to one of the others. Be ready to move in when I jump him. 
1626,CODAL: Right. 
1627,TARON: Right. 
1628,CODAL: Good luck. 
1629,"(Covered in purple fur, Taron joins the end of the procession.)"
1630,
1631, [Plain of Stones] 
1632, (Latep fires his weapon.) 
1633,LATEP: That's it. 
1634,(The Doctor picks up a piece of wood.) 
1635,"DOCTOR: Well, if they come in ones and twos, we might manage to beat"
1636,them off. 
1637,LATEP: And if they rush us? 
1638,(The Doctor lights his piece of wood in the camp fire.) 
1639,DOCTOR: I'm going to try something. 
1640,"(He moves away and brandishes the flame at the eye, shouting Ha! Ha!"
1641,They disappear.) 
1642,"DOCTOR: Don't just stand round there, get yourselves torches. They're"
1643,frightened of flame. 
1644,"LATEP: But, Doctor, there won't be enough wood for the fire. "
1645,DOCTOR: We'll just have to hope that supply lasts till morning. We've
1646,got to keep that fire going at all costs!
1647,
1648, [Jungle] 
1649, (The last of the procession of Spiridons passes
1650,Codal.) 
1651,"CODAL: Taron. If you can work your way through to Vaber, and get close"
1652,"to him, then I'll "
1653,"(Codal pauses then opens the fur. It's wearer is invisible, and knocks"
1654,Codal down. It is just about to hit him with a large rock when Taron
1655,thumps it over the head with a piece of wood.) 
1656,TARON: Come on. You nearly got yourself killed! 
1657,CODAL: I thought it was you. 
1658,TARON: Get into this. 
1659,(Codal puts on the fur.) 
1660,"TARON: Now, stay close to me. We've got to near the one carrying the"
1661,"bombs. When I jump him, grab the bombs and make off quickly. Make as"
1662,much noise as you can. They'll follow you. I'll try and free Vaber. 
1663,"CODAL: Oh, I'll try and head back for the Doctor. If all goes well,"
1664,I'll meet you there. 
1665,TARON: All right.
1666,
1667, [Plain of Stones] 
1668, (Dawn is breaking as the fire is dying.) 
1669,JO: Penny for them? 
1670,"DOCTOR: Oh, I was just thinking about Vaber. What on Earth possessed"
1671,him to go rushing off like that? 
1672,"REBEC: Once we'd worked out the plan, he wanted to attack straight"
1673,away. 
1674,"DOCTOR: Plan, what plan? "
1675,REBEC: To blow up the refrigeration unit. 
1676,DOCTOR: What? But that's the worse thing he could possibly do. 
1677,"REBEC: But Codal said if we destroyed the refrigeration unit, we'd be"
1678,destroying the Daleks. 
1679,"DOCTOR: On the contrary, you'd be bringing their army to life. "
1680,"LATEP: How, Doctor? "
1681,"JO: Oh, I get it. The Daleks you saw in the arsenal were in sort of"
1682,suspended animation. 
1683,"DOCTOR: No ageing process, no degeneration. An army of Daleks in cold"
1684,storage until they're needed. 
1685,REBEC: So that's why they built the refrigeration unit. 
1686,JO: And you mean they need a constant controllable low temperature
1687,because the volcano's too unstable. 
1688,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's about it. And the moment that temperature rises,"
1689,the Dalek army's going to be on the move. Now we've got to find the
1690,others and warn them. 
1691,WESTER: Jo! 
1692,DOCTOR: A Spiridon! 
1693,"JO: Doctor, no! That's Wester. He's the Spiridon that helped me. "
1694,DOCTOR: You sure? 
1695,JO: Yes. 
1696,"DOCTOR: Well, please accept my thanks, Mister Wester. I owe you a very"
1697,great deal. 
1698,"WESTER: Jo, I have news from inside the city. "
1699,JO: What is it? 
1700,WESTER: The Daleks have prepared a bacteria bomb. It will destroy every
1701,living thing on this planet. 
1702,"DOCTOR: Except, presumably, the Daleks? "
1703,"WESTER: Yes, they have a way of immunising themselves. They are"
1704,preparing them to release the bomb now. 
1705,"JO: Well, what shall we do? "
1706,WESTER: I shall go back into the city. Perhaps I can find some way of
1707,delaying them. 
1708,"DOCTOR: Well, thank you for warning us. We'll do all that we can to"
1709,help you. 
1710,"WESTER: Goodbye, Jo. "
1711,"JO: Goodbye, Wester. "
1712,WESTER: I must go now. 
1713,JO: Wester! Take care. 
1714,REBEC: What shall we do about Taron and Codal? 
1715,"DOCTOR: Well, we'll wait till it's full light. If they're not back by"
1716,"then, we move out without them. "
1717,REBEC: Very well. 
1718,"JO: Doctor, what shall we do? "
1719,"DOCTOR: Well, first of all we've got to stop the Daleks releasing their"
1720,"bacteria. Second, we've got to make sure their army stays inactive, and"
1721,"third, we've got to generally put an end to their chances of invasion"
1722,of other planets. 
1723,"JO: Well, how're we going to do all that? "
1724,DOCTOR: (sotto) I haven't the faintest idea.

1726, [Jungle] 
1727, (The Spiridons bring Vaber into a clearing where
1728,there are two Daleks.) 
1729,DALEK: Halt! What is this? 
1730,SPIRIDON: We have captured one of the aliens. 
1731,DALEK: We will question him. Where are the others hiding? Answer! 
1732,"VABER: If you want them. If you want them, you find them! "
1733,DALEK: Answer or we will exterminate you! 
1734,VABER: I haven't seen them. 
1735,DALEK: The others are near the Plain of Stones. You will lead us to
1736,them. 
1737,VABER: No! 
1738,DALEK: You will lead us to them! 
1739,"VABER: No. No, don't fire. I'll take you there. Whatever you say. "
1740,DALEK: We will start immediately. 
1741,VABER: It's back this way. 
1742,(Vaber pushes the Spiridons away and dashes into the foliage. The Dalek
1743,"fires, killing him and a Spiridon. Codal and Taron grab the bombs and"
1744,run.)

1750,DALEK: The antidote is prepared and ready to be administered. 
1751,LEADER: Demonstrate. 
1752,(An lamp comes down from the ceiling and flashes red light over them.) 
1753,DALEK: Synthesised anti-bacterial elements are released in immediate
1754,vicinity of subject. The elements provide immunity on contact. We are
1755,now protected against the bacteria. 
1756,LEADER: Approved. I will order all Dalek units and Spiridon slave
1757,workers assembled here for treatment shortly. Is the bacteria ready for
1758,release? 
1759,DALEK: All is prepared. 
1760,(The perspex tank is full of green gunk.) 
1761,LEADER: The final phase of the operation is to commence immediately. 
1762,DALEK: Removal of the container top is all that is required to allow
1763,bacteria to enter the atmosphere.
1764,
1765, [Control room]
1766,
1767, LEADER: Transmit a general call to all units. They
1768,are to report here immediately for protective treatment prior to
1769,release of bacteria. 
1770,DALEK 2: I obey.

1774, (The Doctor is putting out the remains of the camp
1775,fire.) 
1776,LATEP: Shush! 
1777,(Taron and Codal run in with the furs and bombs.) 
1778,DOCTOR: Where on earth did you get those? 
1779,TARON: We persuaded a couple of Spiridons to part with them. 
1780,DOCTOR: Well done. Have you got the bombs? 
1781,CODAL: Yes. 
1782,LATEP: Where's Vaber? 
1783,CODAL: He's dead. 
1784,TARON: I'll tell you about that later. We've got to move away from
1785,here. There's a Dalek patrol right behind us. 
1786,"DOCTOR: Now, wait. We can't go on running forever. It's time for a"
1787,change of tactics. 
1788,TARON: We can't risk a straightforward confrontation. 
1789,"DOCTOR: No, I agree, so let's stop for a moment and use our"
1790,"intelligence, shall we? "
1791,TARON: All right. What have you got in mind? 
1792,"DOCTOR: Well, to take any effective and permanent action, we've got to"
1793,get inside that city. 
1794,REBEC: How do we do that? 
1795,"DOCTOR: Well, I do have a plan, but you'll have to trust me. "
1796,TARON: What do you want us to do? 
1797,"DOCTOR: Well, first of all, we've got to make sure that a Dalek patrol"
1798,"finds us. Somebody must go out, show themselves and then lead them back"
1799,here. 
1800,LATEP: I'll go. 
1801,"DOCTOR: Thank you, Latep. Now try and lead them around for a bit before"
1802,you bring them back here. We'll need a little time to get ourselves
1803,ready. 
1804,LATEP: All right. 
1805,"JO: Wait, Latep, I'm coming with you. "
1806,DOCTOR: Jo! 
1807,"JO: Doctor, I'm tired of being hunted too. "
1808,"DOCTOR: Yes, all right. "

1816,DOCTOR: I noticed this this morning. Have you seen them before? 
1817,"TARON: Yes, they're all over the place. Molten ice pools. A sort of"
1818,natural spring. 
1819,"DOCTOR: Yes, and hyper-cold. Yes, it's an odd phenomena, the water on"
1820,this planet. It sustains sub-zero temperatures and yet remains
1821,semi-liquid. 
1822,"TARON: I'm sorry, I don't see the significance of all this. We've known"
1823,about these ice pools for some time. 
1824,DOCTOR: The Daleks are vulnerable to extremely low temperatures and
1825,they hardly function at all at sub-zero levels. 
1826,"TARON: Yes. Yes, I see. Come on, let's look around. Find a way of"
1827,making it work.

1963,"DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Jo. No, it must be a two-pronged attack to double"
1964,our chances of success. Have you got the bomb? Whichever group gets
1965,there first must detonate that bomb in one of the tunnels near the
1966,"cooling unit. Block off the Daleks completely. Now, whatever you do,"

2133,JO: (sotto) I've never seen a Dalek like that before.

2138,"JO: Well then, it can take you back to Skaro. "
2139,LATEP: I'd thought of that. 
2140,"JO: But don't you see what that means? Look, you thought that even if"
2141,"this mission was a successful one, that you'd be marooned here for the"
2142,"rest of your lives. With that, you've got a chance of getting home. "
2143,LATEP: But the Daleks haven't been defeated yet. Not by a long way. 
2144,JO: I know. I know all that. But it gives you a chance. It gives you
2145,all something to hope for. I wish the others were here and then we
2146,could tell them about it. 
2147,LATEP: I'm glad they're not. 
2148,JO: But why? If they knew there was a way to escape. 
2149,LATEP: Just knowing might mean the difference between success and
2150,"failure. We all thought that whatever happened, there was no way out."
2151,It was a suicide mission. That's affected everything we've done. We've
2152,"faced dangers and taken risks because there was nothing to lose, Jo. "

2173,CODAL: The main switches are probably in the control room. We don't
2174,want to go back there.

2283,DOCTOR: Can you fix it? 
2284,CODAL: I think so. It'll take a minute or two. 
2285,DOCTOR: Get on with it. 
2286,"TARON: Doctor? Doctor, you're right. There is a power ramp. It goes up"
2287,to ground level. I think we can climb it. 
2288,"DOCTOR: Good, good. "
2289,"REBEC: What are you planning to do, Doctor? "
2290,"DOCTOR: Well, this whole area is simply honeycombed with ice tunnels."
2291,"Now, a bomb put in the right place could so weaken those walls that the"
2292,pressure of the ice would burst through the walls and flood this entire
2293,chamber. 
2294,TARON: Bury the lot of them. 
2295,DOCTOR: That's the theory. 
2296,"REBEC: But it won't destroy them, just put them back into their deep"
2297,frozen state of suspended animation. 
2298,"DOCTOR: Yes, but it would centuries to melt them out. "
2299, [Cooling chamber]
2300,
2301, (Latep reaches the bottom of the knotted rope and
2302,looks out to see the barricade starting to give way. Then Jo appears.) 
2303,LATEP: You all right? 
2304,"JO: Yes, I think so. "
2305,(They look out of the doorway.) 
2306,JO: We've got to stop them. 
2307,(Latep activates his bomb and slides it across the corridor floor to
2308,"the barricade. A Dalek fires and misses him, then they all start to"
2309,come through. Jo and Latep cover their heads as the bomb goes BOOM!)
2310,
2311, [Corridor]
2312,
2313, (The corridor is a blackened mess with bits of
2314,Dalek strewn about.) 
2315,"JO: Come on, let's see if we can find the Doctor. "
2316,(More Daleks approach the far side of the breached barricade.)
2317,
2318, [Arsenal]
2319,
2320, REBEC: They're here! 
2321,"LATEP: They're still coming, Doctor. "
2322,JO: We did what we could though. 
2323,"DOCTOR: Well done, Jo. "
2324,"CODAL: Right, that's it. "
2325,"DOCTOR: Taron, you and the others get started. We'll set the bomb. "
2326,"TARON: Yes. Come on, you two. "
2327,(Jo and Latep leave with Rebec and Taron.) 
2328,DOCTOR: Set it to detonate in thirty seconds. 
2329,CODAL: Right. Detonator running now. 
2330,(The Doctor pushes the bomb into the crevice.) 
2331,CODAL: They're coming! 
2332,(Daleks enter the Arsenal.) 
2333,"CODAL: Hurry up, Doctor! Hurry up! "
2334,DOCTOR: Off you go. 
2335,"(Codal leaves, then the Doctor follows. He joins the rest at the bottom"
2336,of the ramp.) 
2337,"DOCTOR: Twenty seven, twenty eight "
2338,(KaBOOM! A Dalek and the catwalk are taken out.) 
2339,"DOCTOR: It failed! Come on, let's get out of here. "
2340,(A rumbling sound starts up.) 
2341,DOCTOR: The ice volcano! 
2342,"(Liquid ice bursts through the cavern wall where the bomb weakened it,"
2343,and floods down into the main body of the cavern.) 
2344,"DOCTOR: Out, everybody, out! "
2345,(The Doctor watches as the Dalek army is quickly engulfed.)
2346,
2347, [Control room]
2348,
2349, (The Dalek Supreme's aides report to him.) 
2350,DALEK: Arsenal and all lower levels inundated. Molten ice rising
2351,through all sections. 
2352,DALEK 2: No response from any Dalek unit. Total loss of contact. 
2353,SUPREME: Seal off all sections. 
2354,DALEK: Not possible. Controls not responding. Total power source
2355,failure. 
2356,DALEK 2: Sensors registering ice now advancing through upper levels! 
2357,SUPREME: Advise Supreme Command that our attack force is totally
2358,"immobilised, and that we are the only survivors. "
2359,(Liquid ice is pouring down the windows.) 
2360,SUPREME: Set self destruct on all instruments. We are abandoning! We
2361,are abandoning! We are abandoning! We are abandoning! We are
2362,abandoning!
2363,
2364, [Outside the Dalek spaceship] 
2365, LATEP: There it is! 
2366,REBEC: We can get home. Back to Skaro! 
2367,TARON: It's a bonus I never expected. 
2368,"LATEP: Jo, I must speak with you. "
2369,CODAL: Doctor? I need to look over the controls of that ship. 
2370,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. "
2371,"CODAL: So I. (pause) You've done a lot for me, Doctor. Thank you. "
2372,(Codal salutes the Doctor by placing his left hand across his body to
2373,his right shoulder. The Doctor returns the gesture.) 
2374,CODAL: Thank you. 
2375,(Codal leaves.) 
2376,"TARON: Doctor, we'd never have succeeded without all your help. I wish"
2377,there was some way of thanking you. 
2378,"DOCTOR: As a matter of fact, there is. "
2379,"REBEC: Yes, Doctor? "
2380,"DOCTOR: Throughout history, you Thals have always been known as one of"
2381,the most peace loving peoples in the galaxy. 
2382,TARON: I hope we always will be. 
2383,"DOCTOR: Yes, well that's what I mean. When you get back to Skaro,"
2384,you'll all be national heroes. Everybody will want to hear about your
2385,adventures. 
2386,TARON: Of course. 
2387,"DOCTOR: So be careful how you tell that story, will you? Don't"
2388,glamorise it. Don't make war sound like an exciting and thrilling game.
2389,
2390,TARON: I understand. 
2391,DOCTOR: Tell them about the members of your mission that will not be
2392,"returning, like Maro and Vaber and Marat. Tell them about the fear,"
2393,otherwise your people might relish the idea of war. We don't want that.
2394,
2395,REBEC: You can depend on us. 
2396,"DOCTOR: Thank you, my dear. Well, you'd better get aboard, I think. "
2397,TARON: What about them? 
2398,"DOCTOR: I'm not sure about them. Goodbye, Rebec. "
2399,"REBEC: Goodbye, Doctor. "
2400,DOCTOR: Taron? 
2401,"TARON: Goodbye, Doctor. "
2402,DOCTOR: Good luck. 
2403,(Taron follows Rebec.) 
2404,"LATEP: Doctor, I've asked Jo to come back to Skaro with me. Would you"
2405,have any objections? 
2406,"DOCTOR: If that what she wants, no. "
2407,"LATEP: Well, Jo? Is it? "
2408,"JO: No, I'm sorry, Latep. Look, I'm very fond of you, but you see, I've"
2409,got my own world and my own life to go back to. 
2410,(Jo kisses Latep on the cheek and leaves.) 
2411,"LATEP: Thank you, Doctor. "
2412,"DOCTOR: Thank you, Latep. "
2413,"(Latep enters the spaceship with a final wave, the hatch closes and it"
2414,takes off.) 
2415,"DOCTOR: Right, shall we go and find the Tardis? "
2416,JO: Look! 
2417,(The Dalek Supreme is arriving to find his ship has been stolen.) 
2418,"DOCTOR: Come on, run! "
2419,SUPREME: Aliens! Pursue! Pursue! Pursue! Pursue!
2420,
2421, [Jungle - Ruins]
2422,
2423, (The squirt plants start up again.) 
2424,JO: Wait! If those spores hit us 
2425,DOCTOR: They're coming! Now cover your face and hands as best you can!
2426,Come on! 
2427,(Jo stumbles.) 
2428,"DOCTOR: Jo, come on! Come on! "
2429,(They make it into the Tardis just before the Supreme opens fire. The
2430,Tardis dematerialises.) 
2431,SUPREME: Have Supreme Command send rescue craft. 
2432,DALEK: I obey. 
2433,SUPREME: Preparations will begin at once to free our army from the ice.
2434,"We have been delayed, not defeated. The Daleks are never defeated!"
2435,
2436, [Tardis]
2437,
2438, (The Doctor flicks through various images on the
2439,scanner.) 
2440,"DOCTOR: Jo, look. That's Skaro. "
2441,JO: Yes. 
2442,DOCTOR: Any regrets? 
2443,"JO: No, not really. "
2444,"DOCTOR: But Jo, that's only one little world. There's so many hundreds"
2445,of others to see. 
2446,JO: There's only one little world I want to see right now. 
2447,(She changes the scanner image.) 
2448,JO: That one. 
2449,"DOCTOR: That one? But, Jo, that's Earth. "
2450,"JO: That's right, Doctor. Home. "
2451,"DOCTOR: Home it is, Miss Grant.  "
