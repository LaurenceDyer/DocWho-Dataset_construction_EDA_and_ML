20,[Balthazar's spaceship]
21,
22,(A cyborg alien is viewing Earth from his
23,spaceship.) 
24,BALTAZAR: There it is. So small I could reach out and crush it. 
25,(His robot space parrot agrees.) 
26,CAW: Crush it. Crush it. 
27,"BALTAZAR: Quiet, Caw. This is my moment of destiny. "
28,CAW: Moment of destiny. Moment of destiny. 
29,"BALTAZAR: Attention, armoury. Prepare blaster cannons for firing."
30,Commence countdown. 
31,(His birdlike ship flies past the Moon.) 
32,BALTAZAR: I'm the king of the world. 
33,CAW: The world! The world! 
34,(An obsolete blue police telephone box materialises.) 
35,"DOCTOR: Now, forget your Bonapartes, your Boudiccas, your Blackbeards"
36,even. 
37,BALTAZAR: What? 
38,"DOCTOR: This, Martha Jones, this is Baltazar. Scourge of the galaxy,"
39,"Corsair King of Triton in the fourteenth century, the greatest despot"
40,"that ever, ever lived. "
41,"MARTHA: This is just, just fantastic. "
42,"DOCTOR: Yeah, it is kind of cool. Now, the thing about Baltazar "
43,CAW: Scourge of the galaxy. 
44,"DOCTOR: Yeah. The most amazing thing about him is, he forged this ship"
45,himself. 
46,MARTHA: He didn't. 
47,"DOCTOR: By hand. Go on, tell her, Baltazar. "
48,BALTAZAR: I tended her by hand over countless decades. Burnished her
49,into the greatest warship in history. 
50,DOCTOR: And not that long ago blew all of Earth's defence forces from
51,the sky. You really shouldn't have done that. 
52,CAW: Shouldn't have done that. 
53,BALTAZAR: And now I'm going to envelope Earth in a field of plasma
54,"fire, superheat the carbonites who crawl across its surface "
55,DOCTOR: Really? So then all carbon based life will be super-compressed
56,"in a plasma field, making "
57,MARTHA: Diamonds! 
58,"DOCTOR: Er, precisely. Yeah, well done. Yes, every living being turned"
59,into diamonds. 
60,BALTAZAR: The plan starts in seconds. 
61,DOCTOR: Now that is a plan. That is indeed a plan. 
62,(Baltazar threatens the Doctor with his double-hooked arm.) 
63,DOCTOR: Is that not the most incredible plan you've ever heard? 
64,"MARTHA: Oh, incredible. But we're going to stop him, yeah? "
65,DOCTOR: Hmm. By giving him this. 
66,(The Doctor holds up a golden spoon.) 
67,BALTAZAR: Huh? 
68,DOCTOR: I like to stir things up. 
69,(Baltazar breaks the spoon.) 
70,"DOCTOR: Oh, shouldn't have done that. "
71,MARTHA: And he shouldn't have broken your spoon because? 
72,DOCTOR: That wasn't just any old spoon. That spoon passed through the
73,"hands of the greatest chefs of planet Earth. Fanny, Delia, Madame"
74,"Cholette. That spoon was an antique, forged by the now extinct"
75,inhabitants of a planet that specialised in rubicola. 
76,MARTHA: Fungus. 
77,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. But not just any old fungus. No, a special hydroxiling"
78,"fungus. There's been no treatment for it these last two thousand years,"
79,"which is why, Baltazar, scourge of the galaxy "
80,MARTHA: Your deck is rusting away. 
81,BALTAZAR: What? Nooooo! 
82,(Baltazar falls through the rotting metal.) 
83,MARTHA: That's not ordinary rust. 
84,"DOCTOR: No, I pepped it up a bit. Gave it a bit of zing, a bit of"
85,va-va-voom. 
86,CAW: Va-va-voom. Va-va-voom. 
87,"MARTHA: Doctor, you can't leave him. Not to the rust. "
88,"DOCTOR: Oh, well. "
89,(The Doctor sonicks Caw's cage open.)
90,
91,
92,[Tardis]
93,
94,(In flight.) 
95,MARTHA: Will Baltazar ever get caught? 
96,"DOCTOR: Oh, I imagine so. His luck can't hold out for ever. "
97,"MARTHA: So what will happen, do you think? "
98,"DOCTOR: In this era, the most likely Prison Planet would be er,"
99,"Volag-Noc. Yeah, that's where I'd take him if it were up to me. Coldest"
100,place in the galaxy. 
101,MARTHA: Brr. Nasty. 
102,"DOCTOR: Yup. Now, give me a number between zero and ninety nine. "
103,MARTHA: Forty five. 
104,DOCTOR: And another. 
105,MARTHA: Seventy two? 
106,DOCTOR: Another. 
107,"MARTHA: Three. What is this, galactic lorry? "
108,"DOCTOR: Destination setting. And you, Martha Jones, have randomly"
109,chosen to take us to Copacabana beach. Ariba! 
110,
111,[Space]
112,
113,"(Baltazar's ship disintegrates, and Caw flies free"
114,into space. Then see Baltazar sitting on
115,the giant mechanical bird.) 
116,"BALTAZAR: I'll get you for this, Doctor. I'll make you sorry you were"
117,ever born.
118,
119,
120,[Tardis]
121,
122,(The Tardis exits into normal space.) 
123,"DOCTOR: Yes! Six hundred and seventy six million miles an hour, and a"
124,bit. Rock on! 
125,"MARTHA: You're just a boy racer, aren't you. "
126,DOCTOR: Ha! Whoa! 
127,MARTHA: Whoa. What was that? Emergency stop? 
128,"DOCTOR: Oh, search me. There's nothing in the manual. "
129,(A giant bird has grabbed the Tardis. There is another jolt.) 
130,"DOCTOR: Go on, then. We've stopped."
131,
132,
133,[Pheros]
134,
135,"(Not Copacabana beach. Tall thin ruins stand, and"
136,giant birds fly round them.) 
137,MARTHA: We've died and gone to Bill Oddy heaven. 
138,CAW: Bill Oddy heaven. Bill Oddy heaven. 
139,"MARTHA: I know you. It's Caw, isn't it? "
140,"CAW: Welcome to Pheros, Miss Martha. It's Caw's home. "
141,"MARTHA: How are you doing, Caw? "
142,"CAW: I loves you, Miss Martha. "
143,(Caw coughs a brooch depicting himself onto Martha's outstretched
144,palm.) 
145,MARTHA: Oh. 
146,CAW: That's for saving Caw's life all them years ago. 
147,"MARTHA: Thank you, Caw. It's really lovely. "
148,(She attaches it to the front of her jacket.) 
149,"CAW: Got some news for you, Doctor. About Baltazar. Let him out of"
150,Volag-Noc. 
151,"DOCTOR: Volag-Noc. I was right, Martha. "
152,"MARTHA: Yeah, great. Caw, why did they release him from prison? "
153,"CAW: Say he's reformed, but Caw reckons he's as bad as ever he was."
154,He'll be coming for Caw. Caw sold him out for a bar of gold. Or three. 
155,MARTHA: What do you need gold for? 
156,DOCTOR: He eats it. 
157,"CAW: He won't rest, Doctor. He seeks his heart's desire, and knows how"
158,to find it. 
159,DOCTOR: He does? 
160,CAW: The Infinite! 
161,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's just a legend. "
162,MARTHA: What is? 
163,CAW: Baltazar thinks different. Thinks he knows how to find it. 
164,MARTHA: Find what? 
165,DOCTOR: The Infinite. 
166,"MARTHA: Yeah, I got that, but what exactly is the Infinite? "
167,"DOCTOR: Well, let's just say there are things out there in space,"
168,Martha. Things that predate our reality. Relics from the Dark Times. 
169,"MARTHA: Oh, a fairy tale. "
170,"DOCTOR: Oh, far, far more than that. There was a time when the universe"
171,"was so much smaller than it is now. A darker, older time of chaos."
172,"Creatures like the Racnoss, the Nestines and the Great Vampires"
173,rampaged through the void. 
174,"MARTHA: And this Infinite, this is one of those relics from the Dark"
175,Time. 
176,DOCTOR: It's said that if anyone were to find the Infinite they'd
177,"receive their heart's desire. And frankly, that's quite a thing to"
178,receive. 
179,"MARTHA: Yeah, but how's Baltazar going to find it? "
180,(Caw coughs up another metal item with an infinity symbol on it.) 
181,CAW: That's how. 
182,MARTHA: What's that? 
183,DOCTOR: It's a data chip. Part of a black box recorder. Dark Time
184,technology. 
185,CAW: Baltazar gave it to me for safe keeping. Should be four of them.
186,You need to use each one to find the next. 
187,"MARTHA: And find all four, you find the Infinite. Are we going on a"
188,"quest, then? "
189,DOCTOR: No. The Infinite stays lost. It's nothing more than a legend.
190,As last Custodian to the secrets of the universe it's my duty to see it
191,stays that way. 
192,(The Doctor is about to stamp on the data chip.) 
193,CAW: You mustn't. Mustn't. He's got a copy. 
194,"DOCTOR: I can't let someone like Baltazar, someone as corrupt and"
195,"twisted as he is, have access to that kind of power. Caw, you'd better"
196,be right about this.
197,
198,
199,[Tardis]
200,
201,(The data chip is hooked up to the time console.) 
202,"DOCTOR: The planet Boukon? Okay, here we go."
203,
204,
205,[Pheros]
206,
207,(The Tardis dematerialises to reveal Baltazar was
208,standing behind it.) 
209,BALTAZAR: The tracker's in place. 
210,"CAW: Ahem. Thank you, caw. It's really lovely. "
211,BALTAZAR: The Doctor's going to find me the Infinite. Going to find me
212,my heart's desire. 
213,CAW: Heart's desire. Heart's desire! 
214,BALTAZAR: And then I'll have my revenge! 
215,CAW: Revenge! Revenge!
216,
217,
218,[Boukon]
219,
220,"(A desolate, orange place.) "
221,"DOCTOR: Ah, Martha, see those? Artificial suns. "
222,MARTHA: Never. 
223,DOCTOR: Someone wanted the planet Boukon warmed up. 
224,MARTHA: What are they? 
225,(Giant metallic things on legs sucking liquid from the ground.) 
226,DOCTOR: Oil rigs. 
227,"MARTHA: Oil rigs? Hang on, they still need oil in the future? "
228,DOCTOR: It ran out on Earth. The Corporations went drilling elsewhere. 
229,MARTHA: To look at them you'd think they were alive. 
230,(The rigs disengage their suction tubes and turn towards them.) 
231,DOCTOR: You think? Run? 
232,(Not a chance.) 
233,MARTHA: What now? 
234,"DOCTOR: Er, well, I'm open to suggestions. "
235,(Two harpoons slam into the nearest rig's legs.) 
236,"DOCTOR: How'd you do that? Oh, Martha, you're brilliant. Oh yeah, now"
237,you're just showing off. Whoa! 
238,
239,[Black Gold]
240,
241,(The ground on which they are standing turns out to
242,"be the deck of a sort of desert submarine-type vessel, which is now"
243,surfacing and rising into the air. The Tardis topples off onto the
244,ground.) 
245,"KALIKO: Hoist the colours, Mister Mate! "
246,(The mate is at a ships wheel on the deck.) 
247,"SWABB: Aye, aye, Captain. "
248,KALIKO: Let Oil Corp see that the Black Gold is in business. 
249,"SWABB: Aye, aye, Captain. Arr. "
250,(A skull and crossbones lights up on the conning tower.) 
251,DOCTOR + MARTHA: Pirates? 
252,"SWABB: I'm Swabb, first mate aboard the Black "
253,(The Captain comes out of the conning tower. It is a woman with beaded
254,braids and an eye patch.) 
255,"KALIKO: Now then, Mister Mate, put her in reverse. "
256,"SWABB: Aye, aye, Captain. "
257,KALIKO: You two might want to hold on tight. 
258,(The Doctor and Martha clutch each other.) 
259,KALIKO: To the rail. 
260,"DOCTOR: Aye, aye, Captain. "
261,"KALIKO: Take the strain, me hearties. "
262,"SWABB: Heave, lads. "
263,"KALIKO: All right, Swabb, maximum power. "
264,SWABB: Aye! 
265,"(The vessel zooms forward, through the rig's legs, pulling on the"
266,harpoon cables and bringing it down.) 
267,"DOCTOR: Well, that I didn't expect. "
268,"KALIKO: Cut thrust, Mister Mate. "
269,"SWABB: Arr, and pull the rig in? "
270,"KALIKO: And siphon it, Swabb. "
271,"DOCTOR: Hello there, Captain. "
272,KALIKO: Captain Kaliko. 
273,DOCTOR: Hello there. I'm the Doctor. Martha and I 
274,"MARTHA: Doctor, why are they smashing up the oil rigs? "
275,DOCTOR: I told you it was the fortieth century. The last great oil
276,corporations are sucking the solar system dry to feed demand. Petrol
277,"prices have gone through the roof, of course, and the colonies that"
278,can't afford to pay are dying. 
279,"KALIKO: Aye, and the oil companies call us pirates. "
280,"DOCTOR: So you're smashing the rigs, siphoning off the petrol. I see. "
281,MARTHA: Robbing the rich to fuel the poor. But that's brilliant. 
282,"KALIKO: What do you think we should do with them, Swabb? "
283,"SWABB: I don't know, Captain. "
284,"KALIKO: Now what I reckon is, to land up in a place like this, you dogs"
285,are either Oil Corp
286,spies or planning a spot of pirating yourselves. 
287,"DOCTOR: Or, indeed, none of the above. "
288,"KALIKO: Either way, I don't want you on the Black Gold, so ahoy there,"
289,"me heartless hearties, throw these sand-lovers overboard. "
290,"(Her crew are revealed to be skeletons in spacesuits, with laser"
291,cutlasses. Then Swabb fires a laser pistol into the air.) 
292,"SWABB: Hold hard there, lads. "
293,"KALIKO: Swabb, you swab, is this mutiny? "
294,MARTHA: Yes! 
295,"SWABB: Never, Captain Kaliko, not mutiny. "
296,DOCTOR: No. 
297,"SWABB: I just wondered if they be Oil Corp spies, mayhaps we dispose of"
298,"the bodies by putting them inside one of they rigs, ha, ha! Make it"
299,look like an accident. 
300,"KALIKO: You're not as empty headed as you seems, Mister Mate. We'll use"
301,the one we just keel-hauled. 
302,"SWABB: Aye, aye, Captain. (sotto) Don't worry, Doctor, Martha, you're"
303,perfectly safe with me. 
304,MARTHA: What's he up to? 
305,DOCTOR: I don't think our Mister Swabb is all he's cracked up to be. I
306,wonder. 
307,(The floating Black Gold starts siphoning the fuel from the wrecked
308,rig.) 
309,"KALIKO: Said your prayers yet, Doctor? "
310,"DOCTOR: So, er, sorry, let me see if I've got this right. We somehow"
311,"get inside this rig that you've drained of oil and er, then what? "
312,"KALIKO: A quick blast from me mate Swabb's laser pistol, the remaining"
313,oil ignites. 
314,"DOCTOR: Oil Corp find us dead inside, boiled in oil. "
315,MARTHA: That's murder! 
316,"KALIKO: Accidents happen. Now, me hearties, the plank. "
317,(A plank emerges from the prow of the Black Gold. Swabb steps forward.)
318,
319,MARTHA: Careful with that. 
320,"DOCTOR: Ah, ah, ah. Me first. (sotto) I thought Swabb would have made"
321,his move by now. 
322,MARTHA: (sotto) What move? 
323,DOCTOR: (sotto) He's no pirate. If he thinks we're with this Oil Corp
324,then my guess is 
325,MARTHA: (sotto) That he is too. 
326,DOCTOR: (sotto) Fingers crossed. (normal) Ready. 
327,"(The Doctor stands on the plank. Of course, he's done this before, in  Pirate"
328,Planet.) 
329,"KALIKO: I like your style, Doctor. Shame you have to die. "
330,"DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah. "
331,(He aims his sonic screwdriver at her.) 
332,"DOCTOR: Now, let us go or I'll destroy your ship. "
333,"KALIKO: What, with that? No deal. "
334,"DOCTOR: Oh, I wish you weren't so obstinate, Kaliko. Oh, well. "
335,(The screwdriver coughs and splutters.) 
336,MARTHA: Why is it not working? 
337,"DOCTOR: Patience. Sand, in the mechanism. Hang on. "
338,(He blows on it.) 
339,DOCTOR: Success! 
340,KALIKO: And? 
341,"DOCTOR: And, hold on tight. "
342,(The sonic vibrations make the wheel go bang and the skull and
343,crossbones goes out.) 
344,"KALIKO: Cor, dog, you're damaging the Black Gold. "
345,"MARTHA: We're actually on your side, Captain. We came here to save you."
346,
347,"SWABB: It's all right, Martha. The Captain's pirate days are over. I'm"
348,with Oil Corp. 
349,DOCTOR: Told you. 
350,SWABB: And Oil Corp have promised me a new body to replace this bag of
351,"bones. Same goes for you, me hearties, if you'll help me turn the"
352,Captain in. 
353,KALIKO: They'll never turn on me. 
354,(The crew step forward.) 
355,"KALIKO: Oh, no. "
356,"DOCTOR: Thing is, Captain, Swabb here seems to think Martha and I are"
357,"with Oil Corp, too. "
358,SWABB: You're not? 
359,DOCTOR: No. 
360,KALIKO: You're not? 
361,MARTHA: No. 
362,"DOCTOR: Captain, we've come here to rescue you. "
363,KALIKO: What? 
364,"SWABB: Doesn't matter, Captain. Your time is up. Rigs, attack! "
365,(The remaining two rigs fire their lasers at the Black Gold.) 
366,DOCTOR: Lucky they're not great shots. 
367,MARTHA: Define lucky. 
368,SWABB: No! More precision! Fire with more Argh! 
369,(The oil rigs do as they are told.) 
370,"DOCTOR: Roll with it, Martha! "
371,(The Black Gold crashes into the sand.) 
372,MARTHA: Doctor? Doctor? Eek! 
373,SWABB: Forget it. He's gone. But at least I can think of a good use for
374,you. 
375,"MARTHA: Oh, really? "
376,SWABB: Yeah. 
377,(Kaliko stands up behind Swabb.) 
378,"MARTHA: Look, you. Me and the Doctor, we're not here to cause you and"
379,"Oil Corp any trouble, right? We're on a mission. A dead important one."
380,"Got to collect these data chips, you see, stop this Baltazar guy from"
381,"stealing a big spaceship called the Infinite which will give him, well,"
382,"infinite power I suppose, and that's a bad thing because he's not a"
383,"nice bloke, and Swabb? "
384,SWABB: Yeah? 
385,MARTHA: Behind you. 
386,(Swabb turns. Kaliko waves bye to him then ) 
387,"DOCTOR: Aye, aye. "
388,"(The Doctor pops up between them on the ship's wheel, knocking Swabb"
389,backwards. He staggers onto the plank.) 
390,"DOCTOR: Oh, sorry. "
391,MARTHA: Doctor! 
392,(Kaliko retracts the plank and Swabb falls to the ground.) 
393,KALIKO: Will the vile dog live? 
394,"MARTHA: Well, the sand seemed dead soft so it probably broke his fall. "
395,SWABB : I'll get you for this! 
396,"MARTHA: Yep, he's okay. You need some help with that? "
397,"DOCTOR: Could you? Ouch, ow. "
398,(Martha helps the Doctor untangle himself from the wheel spokes.) 
399,"KALIKO: Doctor, you said you'd come here for me. What exactly did you"
400,mean by that? 
401,DOCTOR: Ah. 
402,KALIKO: Well? 
403,"DOCTOR: Your earring, Captain. Do you know what it is, really? "
404,(Kaliko laughs.) 
405,"KALIKO: You're after the Infinite. You fool! Now, I was going to offer"
406,"you both a berth on my next ship, but seeing as how you had an ulterior"
407,motive in rescuing me 
408,(The conning tower doors close between them.) 
409,KALIKO: There's only room for one in my lifeboat anyhow. 
410,"(The top of the tower takes off into the sky, then two parachutes"
411,deploy.) 
412,MARTHA: Looks like she came down somewhere near the Tardis. 
413,DOCTOR: We have to catch up with her. If Baltazar gets that data chip
414,and finds the Infinite 
415,"MARTHA: He gets his heart's desire. The destruction of you, me and"
416,Earth.
417,
418,
419,[Boukon]
420,
421,(The shadow of a large bird passes over the
422,wreckage of Kaliko's lifeboat.) 
423,MARTHA: Look. 
424,(Part of Kaliko's headset is on the sand.) 
425,MARTHA: Surely the fall couldn't do that? 
426,DOCTOR: No. She's been murdered. 
427,(He picks up the data chip with the Infinity symbol on it.) 
428,"DOCTOR: Live by the cutlass, die by the cutlass it seems. "
429,MARTHA: Doctor. 
430,"DOCTOR: I'm so sorry, Kaliko. But we've got what we came for, Martha."
431,Let's see where we're going next.
432,
433,
434,[Tardis]
435,
436,"(The Tardis has landed, and Martha heads for the"
437,door.)
438,"DOCTOR: Hang on, hang on. There could be anything out there. Snakes"
439,"like bendy busses, sabre toothed gorillas, anything."
440,
441,
442,[Myarr]
443,
444,(But Martha is already under the alien purple sky.)
445,
446,MARTHA: Excellent. 
447,"DOCTOR: Right. That way is Main Street, so that is probably Downtown. "
448,MARTHA: Where's the lights? 
449,DOCTOR: Light? 
450,"MARTHA: City like this should be full of lights, especially at night. "
451,(And green glowworms oblige.) 
452,"MARTHA: Doctor, they're bugs! "
453,DOCTOR: So I see. And they're about to swarm! 
454,"MARTHA: Doctor, the bugs. "
455,DOCTOR: They're swarming all around us. 
456,"MEREGRASS: Go on, get out of it. "
457,(The bugs leave. A vehicle with a searchlight on the front stops by
458,them. It is driven by a giant frog with an infinity symbol on the neck
459,of its environment suit.) 
460,MEREGRASS: What's the matter with you two? 
461,MARTHA: Doctor? 
462,DOCTOR: I know. 
463,MEREGRASS: And what are you staring at? 
464,"DOCTOR: Thank you for the timely arrival, Mister er? "
465,MEREGRASS: Meregrass. Ulysses Meregrass. 
466,DOCTOR: Good thing the bugs listen to you. 
467,MEREGRASS: We have an understanding. 
468,MARTHA: I noticed. 
469,"MEREGRASS: I'm here to provide their community, via their Queen, with"

493,(The frog is channelling Marvin the Paranoid Android a lot. The light

514,"DOCTOR: Spot on. As I was saying, your Majesty, these alien attackers "
515,"MEREGRASS: I hope you're not putting a business proposition, Doctor."
516,The bidding is over. I won. 
517,"QUEEN: Meregrass is correct, Doctor. We have our military advisor"
518,already. We do not need another.

530,"DOCTOR: Yeah, trying to kill me. I know. "
531,"MARTHA: No, it's panicking. Doctor, it's just frightened. "
532,"DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, oh, Martha, you are a marvel. Calm, calm, calm, calm."

543,QUEEN: Fleshy biped. We must be protected from fleshy bipeds. Destroy
544,them all! 
545,"MEREGRASS: You can destroy them, your Majesty, with the weapons you've"
546,bought. 
547,"DOCTOR: What's your name, Pilot? "
548,"KELVIN: Pilot Kelvin, sir. "
549,"DOCTOR: Well, Pilot Kelvin, what's wrong with you? Picking a fight with"
550,a bunch of defenceless bugs? 
551,KELVIN: Eh? We didn't start it. 
552,"QUEEN: Yes, they did. The fleshy bipeds have been trying to"
553,"exterminate, wipe us out. "
554,"KELVIN: No, you don't understand. This is my er, this was my home,"
555,"where I was born, brought up. We were here first! "
556,DOCTOR: Is this true? 
557,KELVIN: This used to be a lovely place. My parents had a homestead
558,here. Then the bugs arrived and drove the people out. I only joined up
559,once my parents were killed. 
560,DOCTOR: Killed? Why? Why did you attack? 
561,QUEEN: So many lovely animals they had here. So much lovely dung. 
562,MARTHA: You invaded this planet for dung? 
563,KELVIN: It's one of the last fertile planets in the galaxy. If it
564,"falls, there'll be a famine like you wouldn't believe. "
565,"MEREGRASS: Your Majesty, if I may. My job here is done. I have supplied"
566,you with means to destroy your enemies. Your contract stipulates final
567,payment on delivery. 
568,"QUEEN: Oh, did it? Guess what, Meregrass. I lied! There will be no"
569,payment. Mantasphids do not make deals with fleshy bipeds. 
570,MEREGRASS: Typical Mantasphid. I should have listened to the others. 
571,MARTHA: What others? 
572,"MEREGRASS: The other prisoners. There was a Mantasphid there, too, who"
573,"tipped me off about this little war, so I decided to do the deal. "
574,MARTHA: You were in prison? 
575,"MEREGRASS: Good grief no. I was a broker, a dealer. I could get letters"
576,"and gifts to the inmates, and in return "
577,DOCTOR: You got well paid? 
578,"MEREGRASS: Mmm, of course. But the Governor always said that you could"
579,never trust a Mantasphid. 
580,"DOCTOR: The Governor of which prison was this? Volag-Noc, perhaps? "
581,MARTHA: Volag-Noc. Isn't that where Baltazar was? 
582,MEREGRASS: You know of Baltazar? 
583,(Air raid sirens wail.) 
584,"QUEEN: The fly ships, they're coming back. Bugs, defend us. They'll"
585,destroy it all. 
586,MEREGRASS: We're going to die here too unless we get out of here. 
587,KELVIN: Forget it. You can't get far enough away. 
588,MARTHA: Why not? 
589,KELVIN: Because Earth Command can't afford to lose this planet. You
590,"see, they've even"
591,sacrificed me. 
592,"DOCTOR: Your Majesty, listen to me. There might still be a way. "
593,"QUEEN: Ah, Doctor, this is a fleshy biped thing, is it not? Never say"
594,die 
595,"MARTHA: Yeah, exactly. "
596,"QUEEN: Fleshy bipeds are very stupid creatures, but the fight goes on."
597,We'll win this war yet. 
598,"MARTHA: Pilot Kelvin, what will they do to the city? "
599,"KELVIN: Well, the plan was spatial disintegration of this hundred mile"
600,vector. 
601,DOCTOR: They're going to burn us out of space and time. 
602,KELVIN: Kills all known bugs. Dead. 
603,MARTHA: So we stand here while they vapourise us? 
604,"QUEEN: Meregrass, what do we do? "
605,MEREGRASS: You're asking me? 
606,"QUEEN: You are my military advisor. You know tactics, you know weapons."
607,Help us! 
608,MEREGRASS: I'd have happily helped you when I thought I was getting
609,"paid, but without this the weapons are useless. And without my money,"
610,you get nothing. 
611,QUEEN: Meregrass. Meregrass! 
612,(Meregrass leaves.) 
613,QUEEN: Come back! 
614,DOCTOR: We need to keep track of Meregrass. He has the datachip we need
615,to continue this treasure hunt. 
616,QUEEN: It is decided. How do we surrender to the fleshy bipeds? 
617,"DOCTOR: Oh, at last. Pilot Kelvin, have you got a communications"
618,system? 
619,"KELVIN: Inside my helmet, sir, but it was damaged when I crashed. "
620,"DOCTOR: Oh, we'll soon have that sorted. "
621,"QUEEN: Hurry, hurry. "
622,(The Doctor does a sonic repair.) 
623,QUEEN: We want to surrender. 
624,"KELVIN: Doctor, there's no protocol for negotiation with the"
625,Mantasphids. 
626,MARTHA: Then make one. 
627,"KELVIN: I can't! They invaded our homes, killed our families. "
628,"DOCTOR: They are also living, sentient beings that have a right to"
629,"exist. Maybe not here, but somewhere. "
630,CONTROL : Mantasphid Hive destruction commences in sixty seconds. 
631,"DOCTOR: Ooo, that's not good. "
632,"QUEEN: Please, Doctor. Hurry. "
633,"MARTHA: Doctor, listen, if the bugs can't surrender, surely we can,"
634,can't we? 
635,"DOCTOR: You are brilliant! Pilot, tell them to open up a visual"
636,channel. 
637,"KELVIN: Control, this is Pilot Kelvin. Imperative you open a visual"

647,"have to admit, you got us beaten. Come on in and get us. We surrender!"
648,(transmission ends.) That should do it. 
649,"QUEEN: What have you done, Doctor? "
650,"DOCTOR: Taken the rap for you, Queenie. Ended your war. "
651,MARTHA: They'll never believe it. 
652,"DOCTOR: Oh, you reckon? "
653,"CONTROL : All units, Hive destruction cancelled. Your priority now"
654,is to apprehend male human codename Doctor Bile. 
655,"QUEEN: How can we thank you, Doctor? "
656,"DOCTOR: Easy. Work with the humans, not against them. Young Kelvin here"
657,can make a great ambassador. 
658,KELVIN: Me? 
659,"DOCTOR: Now, listen, your Majesty. The human's farms will need power."
660,"Light and heat are hard to come by in an oil-starved universe, right? "

663,MARTHA: And you get all the dung you could ever want. Brilliant! So
664,what's next?

924,BALTAZAR: I had insider information. Have you met Squawk? 
925,(A tiny metal bird flies from -) 
926,MARTHA: My brooch! 
927,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. "
928,BALTAZAR: This little accessory has helped me track you every step of
929,"the way. Fly away, birdie. "
930,(Squawk flies out of the open Tardis door.) 
931,DOCTOR: An accessory to murder. 
932,"BALTAZAR: Surely that's you, Doctor. You needed a little bit of help"
933,collecting the datachips. I knew my poor old cellmates who told me all
934,about the Infinite would never willingly give you theirs. First there
935,"was Kaliko, then there was Meregrass. Now he dried up very quickly. And"
936,that was Gurney's. Pick it up. 
937,(The Doctor does.) 
938,"DOCTOR: This is why you needed me, isn't it. You knew only my Tardis"
939,could track each datachip from planet to planet. 
940,BALTAZAR: I knew only you would have something that could read
941,datachips older than recorded history itself. Off you go. 
942,"(Meanwhile, Squawk as flown to the remains of Caw.) "
943,(The Tardis console produces a 3D starmap from the datachip.) 
944,DOCTOR: The Hesperus galaxy. 
945,BALTAZAR: Next. 
946,(And zooms into a planetary system.) 
947,DOCTOR: And that'll be the Caris system. 
948,MARTHA: It's a map. 
949,BALTAZAR: Telling us the location of the Infinite. Keep going. 
950,"DOCTOR: I spy asteroid seven five seven four B? Yeah, B. "
951,BALTAZAR: Set your controls. We're going. 
952,DOCTOR: This isn't a taxi! 
953,BALTAZAR: Set the controls or Miss Martha gets skewered. 
954,"DOCTOR: Look, Baltazar, the Infinite, it's a myth, a legend. But even"
955,"if it does exist, even if it contains a fraction of the power everyone"
956,"claims, it'll consume you. Destroy you. "
957,"BALTAZAR: No, it'll give me my heart's desire, Doctor. So set the"
958,controls! 
959,(The Doctor obeys.) 
960,BALTAZAR: That's the course laid in? 
961,DOCTOR: Yes. 
962,BALTAZAR: Then all you have to do is push the button. 
963,"DOCTOR: Well, more or less. "
964,"BALTAZAR: Then I don't need you any more, do I. "
965,"DOCTOR: Er, no. "
966,MARTHA: No! Doctor! 
967,(A green flash from Baltazar's hook arm send the Doctor flying out of
968,the open door.)
969,
970,
971,[Ice planet]
972,
973,(The Doctor wakes up.) 
974,DOCTOR: Martha? No. No! Martha? Martha!
975,
976,
977,[Tardis]
978,
979,(The Tardis is in flight.) 
980,MARTHA: He'll be back. 
981,"BALTAZAR: He's a thousand light years away, alone in the cold. You"
982,won't be seeing him again for a while. Not before I get my heart's
983,"desire, anyway. "
984,
985,[Asteroid 7574B]
986,
987,MARTHA: She's huge. 
988,"BALTAZAR: The wreck of the Infinite, at last. She was smashed to bits"
989,"centuries back, flotsam spread out over half the galaxy. I found out on"
990,"Volag-Noc that Kaliko, Meregrass and Gurney had all come by bits of the"
991,fight recorder. 
992,"MARTHA: Aw, and they wouldn't share them with you? "
993,BALTAZAR: Not even with each other. 
994,MARTHA: I guess X marks the spot. 
995,BALTAZAR: In you go. You're looking for the hold. 
996,MARTHA: The hold? Won't that be Eeek! 
997,(Martha falls down a hole.) 
998,BALTAZAR: Down. Yep.
999,
1000,
1001,[Infinite Hold]
1002,
1003,(The torch goes out.) 
1004,"MARTHA: Diagnosis, no bones broken. That's something. "
1005,(She hears noises.) 
1006,MARTHA: Hello? 
1007,(A shadowy figure appears ahead of her.) 
1008,MARTHA: Hello? 
1009,DOCTOR: Hello. 
1010,MARTHA: Doctor! I knew it! I knew you'd be back. Wait a minute. How? 
1011,DOCTOR: Shush. 
1012,
1013,[Asteroid 7574B]
1014,
1015,BALTAZAR: Girl? Girlie? Martha? 
1016,DOCTOR: Watch out below! 
1017,(The Doctor is flying in on a giant metal bird.) 
1018,BALTAZAR: What? 
1019,DOCTOR: Ahoy there. Meet Squawk. He's grown up now. 
1020,(Baltazar laughs as the Doctor has problems landing.) 
1021,DOCTOR: Haven't got the hang of landing yet. 
1022,(Squawk gets his claws down and the Doctor flies off over his head.) 
1023,SQUAWK: Doctor? 
1024,"BALTAZAR: Out for the count, squawk. And I thought I could rely on you"
1025,at least. 
1026,"SQUAWK: Doctor says you're a bad influence, like you were with me Dad. "
1027,BALTAZAR: And now I have exactly what you need. Gold. Lots and lots of
1028,lovely glittering gold. Keep you fed for years. 
1029,DOCTOR: Oi! 
1030,"(The Doctor throws his vacuum-breather at Baltazar, knocking him down.)"
1031,
1032,DOCTOR: What do I keep on telling you? Don't listen to the villains! 
1033,BALTAZAR: That hurt. 
1034,DOCTOR: Where is she? Where's Martha?
1035,
1036,
1037,[Infinite Hold]
1038,
1039,(Martha is hugging the other Doctor.) 
1040,MARTHA: But what about the treasure? 
1041,DOCTOR: Your heart's desire. 
1042,"MARTHA: Of course. You're not the Doctor. My heart's desire, indeed. "
1043,"(The pseudo-Doctor glows silver, and the real one walks up to them.) "
1044,"DOCTOR: Excuse me, I think that's my friend you're scaring. "
1045,MARTHA: Hiya. Can you make him go away? 
1046,"DOCTOR: That's up to you, I'm afraid. You conjured him up. "
1047,MARTHA: But how am I supposed to 
1048,DOCTOR 2: Heart's desire. 
1049,"MARTHA: Oh, I don't believe I walked into this. "
1050,(It flickers.) 
1051,"MARTHA: Gotcha! I said, I don't believe this. "
1052,(Her heart's desire vanishes.) 
1053,"MARTHA: Oh, yes! "
1054,"DOCTOR: Oh, don't even try to find my heart's desire. "
1055,"MARTHA: Hello you, proper you. "
1056,"DOCTOR: Ah. Now then, aren't you going to ask me how I got here, and"
1057,hear all about my adventures on Volag-Noc? How I bottle-fed Squawk with
1058,my own gold and reprogrammed Lok to run a better prison? It's been
1059,"three years, you know. "
1060,MARTHA: Three years? 
1061,"DOCTOR: Well, two and three quarters. We gained a bit of that by flying"
1062,"past lightspeed, of course. "
1063,MARTHA: Lightspeed? How? 
1064,"DOCTOR: I gave Squawk's engines a bit of pep, bit of zing. bit of "
1065,MARTHA: Va-va-voom? 
1066,DOCTOR: Yeah. 
1067,"MARTHA: I knew you'd be back. So, this is the Infinite. "
1068,DOCTOR: Every pirate and freebooter and treasure hunter dreams of it
1069,and wants to find this. 
1070,"MARTHA: Their heart's desire. What did it show you, by the way? "
1071,"DOCTOR: Doesn't matter. Didn't work on me. Anyway, whatever power this"
1072,place once had is fading away daily. The whole ship's only held
1073,together by wishes and hopes. 
1074,"MARTHA: There's nothing living here, is there. "
1075,"DOCTOR: Not now. One of the great Old Ones was once. It died out here,"
1076,"alone and lost, screaming its rage and fury into the solitude until its"
1077,"unique power dissipated. Just left a little fading echo, enough to give"
1078,us a glimpse of our heart's desire. 
1079,(Baltazar laughs.) 
1080,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. "
1081,"(A massive pile of gold bars fills the hold, bigger than a dragon's"
1082,horde.) 
1083,"BALTAZAR: Gold. Diamonds. Treasure, Doctor, enough treasure to buy me a"
1084,"new ship. A whole fleet. And I can destroy you, Earth, Volag-Noc, and"
1085,everything in between. 
1086,"DOCTOR: Oh, be scourge of the galaxy again, is that the best you can"
1087,think of? 
1088,MARTHA: It's not real. It's just an echo of the power 
1089,"DOCTOR: He's not listening, Martha. The ship's so old and rusted, just"
1090,held together by wishful thinking. 
1091,"(One whiz of the sonic screwdriver, and the horde vanishes. The"
1092,superstructure begins to crumble.) 
1093,"MARTHA: Come on, Captain Useless."
1094,
1095,
1096,[Asteroid 7574B]
1097,
1098,(The Doctor and Martha get back to the Tardis
1099,first.) 
1100,"DOCTOR: Sorry, full up. There'll be another one along in a minute. "
1101,"BALTAZAR: No, Doctor, you can't leave me here! "
1102,(The Tardis dematerialises. The Infinite breaks apart.)
1103,
1104,
1105,[Tardis]
1106,
1107,"MARTHA: I know he was rotten to the core, but"
1108,still. 
1109,"DOCTOR: Oh, I left him a way out."
1110,
1111,
1112,[Asteroid 7574B]
1113,
1114,BALTAZAR: Squawk!
1115,
1116,
1117,[Tardis]
1118,
1119,"DOCTOR: Of course, it'd only matter if I didn't"
1120,know exactly where Squawk was going to drop him off.
1121,
1122,
1123,[Volag-Noc]
1124,
1125,"BALTAZAR: Curse you, Doctor. Curse you."
1126,(His cell door slams shut.) 
1127,
1128,[Tardis]
1129,
1130,"DOCTOR: Searching for your heart's desire, Martha,"
1131,"never been all it's cracked up to be. Now then, Martha Jones, another"
1132,job for you. 
1133,MARTHA: Oh yes? 
1134,DOCTOR: Yes. Start giving me some random numbers. 
1135,"MARTHA: Oh, not again. "
1136,"DOCTOR: Come on, it'll be fun. When do I ever let you down? Ha, ha, ha,"
1137,ha!
