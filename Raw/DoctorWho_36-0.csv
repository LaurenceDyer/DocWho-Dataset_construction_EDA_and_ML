15,  (We
16," look at a comic book's blank panel that says 'later that night', then "
17,down from the night sky to an American street. A New York yellow cab 
18,"passes by Joe's Pizza, then we look up the fire escape and into a young "
19,"man's window. Comic books are by the bed, along with his spectacles, and"
20, he is dreaming of a time when -)
21,
22,[Young Grant's bedroom]
23,
24,(The swoosh of a large pendulum outside the window wakes a boy. He coughs.) 
25,DOCTOR: Hey! 
26,"(Grant puts on his spectacles, turns on his flash light and goes to the window as the Doctor swings by, upside down.)"
27,"DOCTOR: Hello there! Ah, hello! "
28,(Grant opens the window.)
29,YOUNG GRANT: Hello? 
30,DOCTOR: Hello! 
31,YOUNG GRANT: What
32, are you doing?
33,DOCTOR: I was setting a trap. 
34,YOUNG GRANT: A trap? 
35,DOCTOR: On your roof. 
36,YOUNG GRANT: What 
37,happened? 
38,DOCTOR: I tried it out. 
39,YOUNG GRANT: How? 
40,DOCTOR: Accidentally. 
41,(The Doctor stops swinging. Grant sneezes.)
42,DOCTOR: Bless you. 
43,    
44,YOUNG GRANT: Thanks. 
45,DOCTOR: What's your name? 
46,YOUNG GRANT: Grant. 
47,"DOCTOR: Hello, Grant. What floor is this? "
48,YOUNG GRANT: Sixty. 
49,    
50,DOCTOR: Ah! 
51,(The rope and electrical cable around his ankles begin to part and fray.)
52,DOCTOR: Would it all right if I came in?
53,YOUNG GRANT: I'll have to ask my mom.
54,(Grant shuts the window on the Doctor's fingers.)
55,DOCTOR: Ow! 
56,"YOUNG GRANT: Mom,"
57, wake up. 
58,"(The Doctor tries to sonic the sash window open, then Grant opens it again.)"
59,DOCTOR: Oh! 
60,YOUNG GRANT: Mom says you can come in. You're 
61,expected. 
62,DOCTOR: Expected? Argh! 
63,(The rope and cable have finally parted. The Doctor heaves himself back 
64,up over the window sill and collapses on the floor. Grant puts a glass 
65,of milk and plate of cookies down for him.)
66,"DOCTOR: Sorry, did you say I was expected? "
67,    
68,YOUNG GRANT: Yeah. 
69,DOCTOR: Who did you say I was? 
70,YOUNG GRANT: I told her I saw an old guy at the window. (sneezes)
71,"DOCTOR: Ho-ho-ho-ho. Merry Christmas, Grant! "
72,(He eats a cookie and browses Grant's collection of Superman comics. Grant returns to his bedroom.)
73,YOUNG GRANT: Mom and Dad are asleep now.
74, I can get you back on the roof. I know the way. 
75,DOCTOR: Shh. 
76,YOUNG GRANT: What are you 
77,doing?
78,DOCTOR: Take a look at that picture.
79,(Clark Kent talking to Mrs Olsen.) 
80,YOUNG GRANT: Okay.
81,"DOCTOR: Now this one. (Superman) Take a good, long "
82,look. It takes a moment to see it. 
83,YOUNG GRANT: See what? 
84,DOCTOR: Superman and Clark Kent are 
85,one and the same person. 
86,YOUNG GRANT: Are you serious? 
87,"DOCTOR: Yeah. Look, I drew specs on "
88,Superman. 
89,YOUNG GRANT: Everyone knows they're the same person. 
90,"DOCTOR: Well, Lois Lane "
91,"doesn't, and she's a reporter."
92,
93,[Stairs]
94,
95,DOCTOR: Why did they call him Spider-Man? Don't 
96,they like him? 
97,"YOUNG GRANT: He was bitten by a radioactive spider, and guess what "
98,happened? 
99,"DOCTOR: Radiation poisoning, I should think. "
100,
101,[Roof]
102,
103,"YOUNG GRANT: No, he got special powers."
104, 
105,"DOCTOR: What, vomiting, hair loss and death? Fat lot of use. Hey! What do you "
106,think? 
107,YOUNG GRANT: That looks
108,DOCTOR: I know. 
109,YOUNG GRANT: Cheap.
110,(A pile of bits of metal and various styles of television antennae and satellite dishes.) 
111,"DOCTOR: Oh, shut up! Got a cold "
112,"there, Grant?"
113,YOUNG GRANT: I always get a cold at Christmas. 
114,DOCTOR: Me too. Or an invasion. 
115,    
116,(He hands Grant a glass of water.)
117,YOUNG GRANT: Where did you get that from?
118,DOCTOR: My pocket. 
119,YOUNG GRANT: How do you keep a glass of 
120,water in your pocket? 
121,"DOCTOR: Skills. Now hush, I've got a lot of work to do. "
122,Take this.
123,(A small red glowing octahedron.) 
124,YOUNG GRANT: Who are you? 
125,DOCTOR: The Doctor. 
126,"YOUNG GRANT: Yeah, but who are you? "
127,DOCTOR: The Doctor. 
128,    
129,"YOUNG GRANT: Which one, though? There's lots of doctors. "
130,DOCTOR: The one. I'm the main one. The 
131,original. I started it. They're all based on me. Now everyone who wants 
132,to sound clever calls themselves Doctor. Bandwagon! 
133,"YOUNG GRANT: In a comic book, you "
134,know what you'd be called? Doctor Mysterio. 
135,"DOCTOR: Oh, I like that. Doctor "
136,Mysterio! I'll have that. Nearly ready. 
137,YOUNG GRANT: What is it? 
138,"DOCTOR: Well, in terms that "
139,"you would understand? Sorry, there aren't any. It's a, it's a, it's "
140,"a, it's a time-distortion equaliser thingy. "
141,YOUNG GRANT: A what? 
142,"DOCTOR: Well, there's been a lot "
143,"of localised disruption here in New York, so, er, my fault, actually. "
144,Hopefully this will make it all calm down. 
145,YOUNG GRANT: I don't understand. 
146,DOCTOR: Do you 
147,know what a lightning conductor is? 
148,YOUNG GRANT: Yeah. 
149,"DOCTOR: Well, it's not like that."
150,YOUNG GRANT:Â  I 
151,thought you were setting a trap.
152,"DOCTOR: I was, to protect this. I don't want "
153,"anyone turning it off, or stealing it for a Christmas tree. "
154,YOUNG GRANT: But it looks 
155,like a Christmas tree.
156,"DOCTOR: Of course it does, it's science. Do you want to "
157,turn the lights on?
158,YOUNG GRANT: Can I? 
159,DOCTOR: Go on. It's Christmas Day. 
160,YOUNG GRANT: What do I do? 
161,DOCTOR: Ah! 
162,"Right, you put this into this, and you flick all those little switches on. "
163,YOUNG GRANT: Nothing's
164, happening. 
165,"DOCTOR: Yeah, because now we get to the cool bit. Come here. Do you "
166,see that little door there? Pop it open. Now we turn on the lights. Pop 
167,the gemstone right in there. 
168,(Six sets of wires going into a circular holder.)
169,YOUNG GRANT: What gemstone? 
170,DOCTOR: The gemstone that I gave you. Pop it right in there. 
171,YOUNG GRANT: (sotto) That was a gemstone? 
172,"DOCTOR: Well, it's more than just a "
173,"gemstone, it's also like a kind of on-board computer. Come here. Can you "
174,"see, can you see that little yellow star at the end of that curve? It "
175,comes from near there. Formed in the heart of a red hole and stabilised in
176, pure dwarf star crystal. The gemstone is intuitive. It knows what you 
177,want and draws energy from the nearest star to make it happen. There's 
178,only four of them left in the universe. The Apocalypse Monks of 
179,"the Andorax called this one the Hazandra, the Ghost of Love and Wishes. "
180,"Okay, then, pop it in. "
181,YOUNG GRANT: I thought it was medicine. 
182,DOCTOR: What? 
183,YOUNG GRANT: It looked like 
184,medicine. 
185,DOCTOR: What have you done with it? 
186,"YOUNG GRANT: Well, you gave me medicine and a "
187,"glass of water, and you said you were a doctor. I thought it was for my "
188,cough. 
189,(There is a red glow in Grant's chest.)
190,DOCTOR: Oh! You swallowed it. You can't go round swallowing things. What 
191,"age are you, 36? "
192,YOUNG GRANT: Eight. 
193,(The Doctor runs the sonic screwdriver over him.)
194,YOUNG GRANT: Am I going to get sick?
195, 
196,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. Quite the opposite."
197,YOUNG GRANT: The opposite? What's the opposite? 
198,(Grant's feet have left the ground. The Doctor gently pushes him back down.)
199,YOUNG GRANT: What
200, happened? 
201,DOCTOR: Nothing. 
202,YOUNG GRANT: What's wrong with me? 
203,"DOCTOR: Well, you've got a cough and a"
204, slight case of levitation. Stay calm.
205,YOUNG GRANT: What happens if I don't stay calm?
206, 
207,(The Doctor has to jump to grab the boy's legs.)
208,DOCTOR: Oh! Don't panic.
209,YOUNG GRANT: What happens if I panic? 
210,"(They zoom off into the night sky, screaming.)"
211,
212,[Nursery]
213,
214,"(A baby's crying is being relayed by a monitor. Grown up Grant wakes, puts on his spectacles and goes to the nursery.)"
215,"GRANT: Oh, hey, you're all right. Hi, you're okay."
216,(He picks up the baby.)
217,GRANT: Yeah. 
218,"Ssh-ssh-ssh-ssh! (later, on the phone) Hey, Mrs Lombard. No, don't worry, Jennifer's fine. She"
219," just woke up, but I'm going to put her back to sleep. No, it's okay, Mrs "
220,Lombard. It's what you pay me for. okay. Goodnight. 
221,
222,[Top of the Empire State Building]
223,
224,"DOCTOR: Grant, you need to "
225,concentrate. 
226,YOUNG GRANT: What's happened to me? 
227,"DOCTOR: Intuitive crystal, plus too many "
228,comic books. The gemstone is giving you what it thinks you want. You're a
229, superhero! 
230,
231,[Harmony Shoal]
232,
233,(A
234," skyscraper with a rotating globe on top, with Harmony Shoal written "
235,where it ought to say Daily Planet. A press conference is closing.)
236,BROCK: Any questions after today can be handled by Miss Shuster or
237," Miss Siegel, who can be contacted on the e-mail addresses provided in "
238,"your welcome pack. That's all we have time for, ladies and gentlemen. I "
239,"hope you had a stimulating day, and maybe saw a little of what makes "
240,Harmony Shoal the foremost innovator in science and technology the world 
241,"over. Like we always say, we're here to open your minds. "
242,"LUCY: Mister Brock, just "
243,"one more question. I've been looking into your funding, and you seem to "
244,have a lot of benefactors for a research institute. 
245,BROCK: The world is 
246,"changing, Miss Fletcher. Science got sexy. "
247,"LUCY: Yeah, but your benefactors? I "
248,can't seem to find any of them. 
249,BROCK: Very simple reason for that. I killed 
250,"them all, buried them in my back yard. "
251,(Laughter.) 
252,LUCY: How big is your back 
253,"yard, Mister Brock? "
254,"BROCK: At the last count, Wyoming. "
255,(More laughter.)
256,"BROCK: Now, if you good "
257,"people will excuse me, this young lady will guide you to the exit. "
258,NARDOLE: Mister 
259,"Brock? Er, Mister Brock? Mister Brock? Mister Brock. "
260,BROCK: Apparently we have one more 
261,question. 
262,NARDOLE: Yes. Where is the little boys' room? 
263,BROCK: I think you'll find the 
264,"restrooms to the left, on your way out. "
265,"NARDOLE: No, not the restrooms, the little "
266,boys' room. 
267,"BROCK: If you successfully locate the restrooms, I think you'll find"
268, everything you need in there. Thank you all.
269,"WOMAN: This way, ladies and "
270,gentlemen. 
271,"NARDOLE: I don't want a rest. If everyone's just having a rest, I might"
272, cause an incident.
273,(Lucy looks across at a woman sweeping the floor. Meanwhile Brock goes 
274,to a man dabbing at his nose and getting a blue stain on his 
275,handkerchief.) 
276,"BROCK: Doctor Sim, is there a problem? "
277,SIM: It's the brains. There's
278, something I need to show you. It's necessary.
279,(Brock sees Lucy with the cleaner.)
280,BROCK: Later. Meet me here at 
281,midnight. 
282,"SIM: Thank you, sir. "
283,"(Midnight, Sim is sitting in front of one of a few rows of computer "
284,screens ranged to the side of the main open area where the conference 
285,"was held, and just behind the big corporate logo, when a hand grasps his shoulder and makes him jump.)"
286,SIM: Mister Brock. You startled me. 
287,BROCK: Shall we? 
288,SIM: Of 
289,course. 
290,"(Lucy, dressed as a cleaner, watches them walk through reception, then "
291,"follows. Nardole is also watching, and speaks into one of his duffel "
292,coat toggles.)
293,NARDOLE: All clear. 
294,
295,[Brain safe]
296,
297,(A
298, thick strongroom door opens and the lights come on to reveal a 
299,"horseshoe arrangement of three shelves, all containing brains in glass "
300,cases.)
301,BROCK: Well? 
302,SIM: Look at 
303,them. You see nothing unusual? 
304,BROCK: I see brains every place except here. 
305,(Sim's head.) These specimens were donated to this facility by our benefactors for a 
306,"top-secret research project. A project which is not to be questioned, "
307,"impeded, or in fact mentioned by any of the employees of the Harmony "
308,Shoal Institute. Even I don't have the clearance to know what's going on 
309,in here. 
310,(Lucy is eavesdropping.)
311,SIM: But why? 
312,BROCK: It's not your job to ask questions. Stick to science.
313,(Sim's eye flickers sideways.)
314,BROCK: Something wrong with your eyes? 
315,"SIM: Sir, the first time I came in here, I "
316,"counted twenty four specimens. The second time I counted, there were thirty. Now there"
317, are thirty six. 
318,"BROCK: Well, I guess they've got the space. "
319,SIM: You don't understand. 
320,"There have been no deliveries. I checked it. Some of these brains, "
321,"sir, they just... ..arrived. "
322,
323,[Outside the Brain Safe]
324,
325,(Lucy leans back to hear someone eating. The Doctor is snacking on sushi or more likely hosomaki.)
326,"DOCTOR: It's okay. I'm an intruder too. Yeah,"
327, I brought snacks. Mark of a pro. Keep listening. 
328,
329,[Brain Safe]
330,
331,BROCK: Looks like a brain to 
332,"me. Kind of blue, I guess,but that's the fluid, right? "
333,SIM: Yes. That's the 
334,"fluid. (which is dribbling out of his nose.) Tap the glass, sir. "
335,BROCK: What'd you say?
336,"SIM: Tap the glass, please. "
337,    
338,"(Brock taps the glass, and two eyes appear between folds of the brain.)"
339,BROCK: What? What the hell is that? Is that a joke?
340,"SIM: No sir, it's not a joke. "
341,BROCK: It's 
342,"got eyes! Look at them, they're like (Sim's eyes flicker sideways again.) They're like your eyes. "
343,"SIM: Yes sir,"
344, they are. 
345,BROCK: Doctor Sim? What are you pointing at?
346,(Sim points at a brain in an empty jar on the top shelf.)
347,SIM: I'm pointing at Doctor Sim. 
348,Don't look so alarmed. We merely exchanged containers. You might call 
349,this a hijack. 
350,"(Brock punches Sim, who grabs him by the throat, then throws him to the "
351,floor. Sim pushes the two halves of his head back together along the 
352,diagonal scar.)
353,BROCK: What happened to you? I don't 
354,understand. 
355,SIM: The same thing that is about to happen to you. I had a change
356, of mind. 
357,"(Sim leaves, closing the strongroom door behind him. Three doors slide "
358,up behind the shelves and three blank-faced figures in white surgical 
359,scrubs and masks step out.)
360,"BROCK: No, no, please, no! Let me out of here! What's happening?What "
361,are you doing? 
362,(One of the surgeons unscrews the lid of a brain jar.)
363,
364,[Outside the restrooms]
365,
366,(Sim
367, finishes sealing the strongroom door and leaves. The Doctor taps Lucy 
368,"with a chopstick and gestures for them to go the opposite way, down some"
369, stairs. The Tardis has parked herself on a mezzanine above the restrooms.)
370,DOCTOR: Who are you? 
371,"LUCY: Lucy Fletcher, "
372,"reporter from the Daily Chronicle. Hang on, why am I telling you the "
373,truth? 
374,"DOCTOR: Spooky, isn't it? Looking for a story? "
375,LUCY: I think I just found one. 
376,    
377,DOCTOR: Brains with minds of their own? No one will believe that. This is 
378,America. 
379,LUCY: Who are you? 
380,(They go over to a map of the world with markers in it.)
381,"DOCTOR: Special Agent Dan Dangerous from Scotland Yard, "
382,"Scotland. The Doctor for short. See, they've got institutes all over the "
383,world. And always in capital cities. 
384,NARDOLE: Nope. 
385,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, they are, see? "
386,NARDOLE: New 
387,"York's not a capital city,is it? "
388,DOCTOR: (sotto) You don't need to point out 
389,the mistakes. That's not what you're for.
390,"NARDOLE: Washington's got its own one, yeah. "
391,    
392,(The main lights come on.)
393,"SIM: I would call Security, but they might leave you alive. I "
394,do not want any awkward questions about the intruders I was forced to shoot 
395,for my own protection. 
396,DOCTOR: Good plan. Here's another one. (he turns his back on Sim.) Go on. Tell them 
397,you shot us in the back in self-defence. We'll be laughing all the way to 
398,the slab. 
399,(Knocking nearby.)
400,SIM:Â  Face me. 
401,DOCTOR: Maybe not. 
402,SIM: Face me now. 
403,"(Knock, knock, knock.)"
404,SIM: What is 
405,that? 
406,NARDOLE: It's not me. 
407,LUCY: It sounds like 
408,DOCTOR: Like someone knocking at a
409, window.
410,LUCY: We're on the hundredth floor. 
411,(They all turn to look at the plate glass windows behind them. A masked man is standing there in mid-air. 
412,"LUCY: Oh, my God, he's "
413,real.
414,DOCTOR: Who's real? 
415,LUCY: The Ghost. 
416,DOCTOR: Who's the Ghost? 
417,LUCY: Masked vigilante. But 
418,he's 
419,DOCTOR: What? 
420,LUCY: Super. 
421,(The Ghost snaps his fingers and the plate glass shatters. He glides inside.)
422,GHOST: Mind if I come in? 
423,SIM: Impressive.
424," Those windows, like everything in this building, are built to withstand a"
425, blast equivalent to four nuclear explosions. 
426,GHOST: Sorry about that. Would you
427, like me to call a glazier? 
428,SIM: Hmm. 
429,"(Sim empties his gun clip into the Ghost, but they just bounce off. The "
430,"Ghost brushes the final bullet of his G breast plate, then in a blink he"
431, is holding Sim up by the neck.)
432,GHOST: Please 
433,"understand, it's against my personal code to cause lasting harm to any "
434,individual. 
435,(He throws Sim against the map.)
436,"GHOST: However, light to moderate injury's fine. "
437,NARDOLE: That was 
438,good. 
439,GHOST: Hello. Was that man annoying you? 
440,LUCY: You're real? I can't believe 
441,"it, you're actually real. "
442,"GHOST: I'm afraid I am. I enjoy your column, Miss "
443,Fletcher. 
444,LUCY: You read my column? You read? You're real and you read? 
445,GHOST: Though I
446, find the political bias in your paper's editorial not entirely to my 
447,taste.
448,LUCY: I'll pass that on. 
449,GHOST: Thank you. Who are these gentlemen? 
450,    
451,"LUCY: They're, er. I don't actually know. "
452,"DOCTOR: This is my friend, Nardole."
453,"NARDOLE: Hello, "
454,the Ghost. 
455,DOCTOR: And I'm the Doctor. 
456,GHOST: The Doctor. I thought we had lots of 
457,doctors. I'm the main one. 
458,(The Ghost gives a little nod then turns to Lucy.)
459,GHOST: Can I give you a ride home?
460,LUCY: You have a car? 
461,    
462,GHOST: No. (He takes her in his arms.) I hope you're okay with heights.
463,LUCY: I'm okay so far. 
464,GHOST: Have a good 
465,"evening, gentlemen. "
466,"(He flies of into the night sky, Lucy screaming with delight.) "
467,NARDOLE: He seems nice. 
468,DOCTOR: Grant.
469,
470,[Top of the Empire State Building]
471,
472,YOUNG GRANT: So I'm a 
473,superhero now? 
474,"DOCTOR: Well, once the gemstone is gone from inside you, you'll be back "
475,to normal. It will pass.
476,YOUNG GRANT: But how will it get out? 
477,"DOCTOR: Like I said, it will "
478,pass. Looking forward to that. 
479,YOUNG GRANT: Are you sure?
480,DOCTOR: Of course I'm not sure. 
481,Nothing's ever sure. Just promise me one thing. For as long as you 
482,"have these powers, you will never, ever use them. "
483,YOUNG GRANT: Sure. 
484,
485,[Street]
486,
487,GHOST: Is this the right
488, building? They all look the same from up there. 
489,"LUCY: Yeah. Yeah, this is me, "
490,thanks. 
491,"GHOST: Well, I certainly hope this unpleasant experience hasn't put you "
492,off a career in journalism.
493,"LUCY: Oh, no, no, no, not at all. "
494,(Something beeps from a pouch in the Ghost's cape. He turns to check a baby monitor.)
495,GHOST: Sorry. 
496,Duty calls. 
497,LUCY: Look at that. The Bat-Signal's an app now? What is it? Bank 
498,robbery? Hijack?

505,"(Baby Jennifer is crying when the Ghost flies into his bedroom window, does a "
506,"Wonder Woman twirl to change into mild-mannered Grant, puts on his "
507,spectacles then discovers that the crib is empty. The Doctor is cradling
508, the baby.)
509,DOCTOR: With great power comes great responsibility. No man worthy
510, of the title leaves a baby alone. 
511,GRANT: How did you find me?
512,DOCTOR: I tracked the 
513,gemstone inside you.

517,"(They go through to the main living area, with kitchenette in the corner and a dining table, etc.)"
518,"DOCTOR: Your powers, they don't belong in this world. "
519,They're an anomaly. You promised me you'd never use them. 
520,GRANT: May I take her?
521, 
522,DOCTOR: She's yours? 
523,GRANT: I'm hers. I'm her nanny. 
524,DOCTOR: (handing Jennifer over) You're her nanny? 
525,"GRANT: Yeah, her "
526,nanny. You got a problem with that? 
527,"DOCTOR: No, no, it's just, well, okay, so you are a "
528,superhero and a nanny? 
529,"GRANT: Well, you've got to make a buck somehow. I mean, you don't get "
530,paid for saving people. 
531,"NARDOLE: Oh, you don't have to tell us. Here you go, nice and "
532,warm. And tasty. 
533,"(Grant takes the baby bottle from Nardole, who then spots a toy to play with.)"
534,"NARDOLE: Ooo, elephant. "
535,GRANT: It's fine. It's a 
536,long-range baby-monitor. I can get back to this apartment quicker than 
537,most people can get to their kids' bedrooms. 
538,"DOCTOR: Grant, Grant, this is "
539,"insane. Look, I'm me, the Doctor, and even I think this is insane. "
540,NARDOLE: Even 
541,him. 
542,GRANT: I can cope.
543,DOCTOR: Of course you can't. When do you sleep? When are you not 
544,on call? How complicated do you need your life to be? 
545,(The apartment door opens and closes. The Doctor and Nardole have nowhere to hide.)
546,"GRANT: Well, not as complicated as it's about to get. Er, we're in here, Mrs "
547,Lombard. 
548,"LUCY: Oh, Jennifer, look at you, up again? Don't you ever sleep? "
549,GRANT: Did 
550,"you have a good evening, Mrs Lombard? "
551,"LUCY: Oh, it was work. Why would it be "
552,good? 
553,"GRANT: Well, I don't know, you seem a little buzzed. I thought maybe you'd"
554, met someone.
555,"LUCY: Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. Grant (spots the Doctor and Nardole.) What are you doing "
556,here? 
557,"NARDOLE: We could ask you the same question. But it's your apartment, so we "
558,probably won't. 
559,"DOCTOR: Well, we, we, we, we were worried about you. We wanted to "
560,"make sure that you were all right, so, er, we followed you. "
561,LUCY: You followed me 
562,and got here first? 
563,"DOCTOR: Well, that's just a measure of our concern. "
564,NARDOLE: Very 
565,concerned. 
566,GRANT: They said they knew you. I let them in. 
567,LUCY: We met tonight. We 
568,"need to talk, you and me. "
569,GRANT: Oh! Did something happen? 
570,LUCY: Nothing 
571,for you to worry your pretty little head about. I'll put her to bed.
572,GRANT: I can
573, do that. 
574,"LUCY: No, it's okay, I want to. "

585,DOCTOR: I'm your relief algebra teacher. Thought I'd check
586, in on you and see how you're coping. 
587,"TEEN GRANT: Well, it hasn't passed, if that's what "
588,you want to know. 
589,DOCTOR: I think that it's a part of your DNA now. It's bonded 
590,with you. I'm sorry. Why aren't you looking at me?
591,TEEN GRANT: I don't want to. 
592,    
593,DOCTOR: You're not looking at anyone. Are you shy now? Is that floor really 
594,interesting? 
595,TEEN GRANT: I'm not shy. I just can't stop it.
596,DOCTOR: Can't stop what? 
597,TEEN GRANT: The 
598,X-ray vision. 
599,DOCTOR: Oh. 
600,TEEN GRANT: I'm in hell. Naked hell. I just can't look at people.

608,everyone. 
609,DOCTOR: But Lucy is your favourite.

617,
618,GRANT: She even remembered me.
619,"DOCTOR: Oh, that"
620, was lucky. 
621,"GRANT: And I was with my best friend at the time, and she "
622,couldn't take her eyes off him. 
623,DOCTOR: Okay. 
624,GRANT: Love at first sight. 
625,DOCTOR: Right. 
626,GRANT: Then 
627,"marriage, then a baby, and then he ran off with someone else. "
628,"DOCTOR: Leaving, I"
629," suppose, the field open for you to move in. "
630,GRANT: Yeah. 
631,DOCTOR: And care for the 
632,child she'd had by another man. 
633,GRANT: Yeah. 
634,DOCTOR: So she could keep working and 
635,possibly date other friends of yours. 
636,GRANT: Pretty much. 
637,DOCTOR: You tiger. Thank 
638,you! 
639,GRANT: Who are you thanking? 
640,DOCTOR: The universe. There's somebody worse at this 
641,than me.

653, is at the table typing on her laptop as the television on the kitchenette wall reports a major fire in

656,"(On the television, the Ghost flies into the burning building.)"
657,"LUCY: So, you're from Scotland Yard? "
658,DOCTOR: Yes. 
659,    
660,"(Lucy grabs Mister Huffle, hard.)"
661,LUCY: It's fine if you don't tell me your secrets. I intend to
662, keep mine. But don't lie to me. 
663,DOCTOR: Or what?
664,LUCY: I hurt Mister Huffle. 
665,(Huffle re-inflates with a long squeak.) 
666,"LUCY: I assume you belong to some kind of, I don't know, agency, I "
667,"don't care which one, and that your current assignment is to investigate"

670,(Lucy grabs Huffle with both hands.)
671,"DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Yes, fine, okay, yes, broadly speaking, yes. "
672,LUCY: What are those brain 
673,things? 
674,DOCTOR: I don't know. It's nothing that need concern you. 
675,LUCY: I'm a reporter.
676, That category does not exist. What are they? 
677,DOCTOR: You wouldn't believe me if I
678, told you. 
679,"LUCY: No reason not to tell me, then. "
680,(Huffle is struggling to re-inflate.)
681,"DOCTOR: Those brains,"
682, they aren't just brains. They're independent alien life forms. 
683,LUCY: And? 
684,

686,replacing the central nervous systems of compatible hosts. 
687,LUCY: And? 
688,    
689,DOCTOR: Harmony Shoal is a multinational corporation whose true purpose is to 
690,"extract and replace the brains of key authority figures from around the world, "
691,and prepare Earth for full colonisation. 
692,(Huffle re-inflates with a quick squeak!) 
693,LUCY: Ha. 
694,DOCTOR: You believe me?
695, 
696,LUCY: I don't think you're lying. Slightly different. What has Harmony 
697,Shoal got to do with the Ghost? 
698,DOCTOR: Nothing. 
699,"LUCY: Ah, so you know who the Ghost "
700,"really is, then? "
701,"DOCTOR: No, I have no idea. "
702,"LUCY: Oh, stop it. We just went to a"
703, top-secret science research facility apparently run by brains from 
704,"space, and a flying man with superpowers turns up. Anybody would assume "
705,"the two were connected, except for somebody who already knew they weren't. "
706,"So, clearly, you know the Ghost and trust him. Nobody trusts "
707,"anybody without knowing who they are, so you know who he really is. So now"
708," you can tell me. Who is he? Oh, that's interesting. You don't work for "
709,"an agency, do you? "
710,DOCTOR: Don't I? 
711,"LUCY: You're not used to being spoken to like this, "
712,which means you don't have a boss or an employer. So why are you 
713,investigating Harmony Shoal? What's in it for you? 
714,DOCTOR: I like to keep busy. 
715,    
716,LUCY: Why? What happened to you? 
717,"DOCTOR: Nothing. Oh, look!"
718,(He grabs Huffle and goes to the television. The Ghost is being interviewed.)
719,LUCY: Oh!

721,"prevention is the responsibility of every citizen, so get a smoke "

723,(Jennifer cries. Lucy turns away and doesn't see the Ghost check his baby monitor.) 
724,"GHOST [on TV]: Sorry, duty calls. "
725,"LUCY: Oh, look at him go. I need to"
726, know who he is. 
727,GRANT: You're all right. She just needs a change. 
728,"LUCY: Oh, it's okay, "
729,"I'll do it. You're so quick, Grant. "

743, the mask? 
744,DOCTOR: You're smart. You're so clever I actually noticed. I hardly 
745,ever listen when other people are talking. 
746,LUCY: So what? 
747,DOCTOR: So why can't you find
748, him yourself? 
749,LUCY: I got a lead. 
750,DOCTOR: What lead? 
751,LUCY: You. You know him. Don't even 
752,try telling me you don't. 
753,DOCTOR: Maybe you know him too. 
754,"LUCY: Hey, where'd Grant "
755,go? 
756,"GRANT: Right here, Mrs Lombard. "
757,LUCY: Oh. 
758,GRANT: Would you like your coffee?
759,"LUCY: Oh, no, I'm okay, thanks. Are you all right? "
760,GRANT: Sure. Why? 
761,LUCY: You're kind of wet.

763,mild-mannered.

765,LUCY: Can you put me in touch with him? 
766,DOCTOR: The Ghost? 
767,"LUCY: Yeah, the "
768,Ghost. 
769,(Grant shakes his head.)
770,"DOCTOR: Mrs Lombard, there are some situations which are just too stupid "
771,to be allowed to continue.

773,LUCY: Hang on. Hello. 
774,GHOST : Is 
775,this Lucy Fletcher? 
776,LUCY: Yes. Who is this? 
777,"GHOST : Sorry, I had to fly."

779,"GHOST : Hello, Lucy. "
780,"LUCY: So, I'm"
781, hoping this means I'm getting an interview. 
782,GHOST : An interview is entirely 
783,"possible, but I must make one thing clear. There must be no talk of who I"
784, really am. 
785,(Grant is in the kitchen area. We get split screen.)
786,"LUCY: Hey, you make the headlines, you make the rules. "
787,GRANT: Discussion 
788,of my true identity would put the people closest to me 
789,at risk. That is not acceptable.
790,"LUCY: Fair enough, get that. How about "
791,tomorrow night? 
792,GRANT: For what? 
793,LUCY: The interview? We could get dinner. 
794,GRANT: Dinner. 
795,LUCY: Do
796, you eat dinner? 
797,GRANT: Of course I eat dinner. 
798,"LUCY: Okay, then. Pick me up here "
799,"tomorrow night, er, eight o'clock? I'll wait for you on the roof? Wait a second. "

805,tomorrow night? 
806,GRANT: Er 
807,"LUCY: Please, it's important. "
808,BOTH: I've got a date. A date? 
809,"LUCY: Er, kind of a date."
810,GRANT: Okay. 
811,LUCY: An interview. Are you seeing
812, someone? 
813,GRANT: Er 
814,"LUCY: None of my business. I mean. But are you? I mean, you "
815,"never even go out, and suddenly you've got a date? "
816,"GRANT: Yeah, well, it kind of"
817, came as a surprise to me too. 
818,LUCY: I'm sorry? 
819,GRANT: It's complicated. 
820,DOCTOR: I can confirm
821, that it's definitely complicated.

823,look after Jennifer.

836,"DOCTOR: Grant, how long have "
837,you known this woman? 
838,GRANT: Since elementary school. Twenty four years. 
839,"DOCTOR: Twenty four years? Yeah, "
840,"of course it would be that, wouldn't it."
841,GRANT: Are you okay? 
842,DOCTOR: Time passes for everyone. Even 
843,"for me. So, please, as much as it is possible for a human male, try not "
844,to be an idiot.

892,"in every capital city in the world, so clearly the plan is to unzip the"

1071,LUCY: I get it. There's 
1072,some stuff you'd like to keep private.

1075,LUCY: How do you cope with your double life? 
1076,GHOST: I'm nothing 
1077,special. Everyone has a day job. 
1078,LUCY: Come on. You spend half your time as a

1080,GHOST: I spend all my time that way.

1161,NARDOLE: What do you 
1162,DOCTOR: You see? The reactor core. It's cycling at critical. Someone's been 
1163,rewiring. This isn't a ship any more. It's a giant bomb. 
1164,NARDOLE: Ooo! Just going

1172,"NARDOLE: Surely they want to conquer the Earth, not blow "
1173,it up. 
1174,"DOCTOR: Oh, you couldn't blow up the Earth with this. But you could wipe out"
1175," a city. Good point, well made. "
1176,NARDOLE: What point?
1177,DOCTOR: New York. It's not a capital 
1178,city. You're quite right. 
1179,NARDOLE: Oh. I don't understand. 
1180,DOCTOR: What if you dropped 
1181,this ship on New York? What would happen? 
1182,NARDOLE: The reactor core would split 
1183,and New York would vaporise. 
1184,"DOCTOR: Not all of it. Not all of it, Nardole. "
1185,"Remember what he said, the scary little German fella? "

1192, stage-managing an alien attack when the aliens have already landed. 
1193,NARDOLE; But 
1194,why?
1195,DOCTOR: Because of what happens next. When everyone thinks that the Earth is 
1196,"being attacked from space, what then? "
1197,NARDOLE: Mass panic.
1198,(Thumping on door.) 
1199,"NARDOLE: Ooo, "
1200,speaking of panic! 
1201,"DOCTOR: Don't worry, it's triple deadlock-sealed. It'll hold "
1202,"for at least ten minutes. The people will panic, yes. But what about the"
1203," world leaders? The presidents and kings, the prime "
1204,ministers and generals? What will they do? What do the rich old men 
1205,always do when the fighting starts? They'll find the safest place to hide 
1206,themselves away and send all their young people to die. And where's the 
1207,safest place in every capital city now? What's the only part of New 
1208,York still standing? 
1209,NARDOLE: Harmony Shoal. 
1210,DOCTOR: New York isn't a capital city. It's a
1211," shop window. When the world is in danger, come hide with us. Harmony "
1212,Shoal will open its doors to the terrified leaders of the world. 
1213,SIM : And they
1214, will come running. 
1215,"DOCTOR: A few hours later, every politician and "
1216,commander-in-chief will have a zip in their head. An alien sitting 
1217,"inside their skull. In one day of terror, the executive authority of "
1218,Planet Earth will pass to Harmony Shoal. It's a good plan. I like it. How
1219, come our side never gets plans like that? 
1220,SIM : The humans have no plan at 
1221,all.
