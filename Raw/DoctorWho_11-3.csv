20,One 
21," (On a blue lit planet, a man dressed in what"
22,appears to be a spacesuit is staggering through a difficult terrain. He
23,"pauses for breath and is shot in the side by an arrow, then collapses"
24,and tumbles down a slope into a small pool.)
25,
26, [Tardis]
27,
28," (The Doctor is twirling a large, colourful beach"
29,"umbrella, and singing.) "
30,"DOCTOR: Oh, I do like to be beside the seaside, I do like to be beside"
31,the sea. 
32,"(Sarah is in shorts and halter top, and assembling items for a day on"
33,the beach.) 
34,"SARAH: Sunglasses, sun lotion, water wings. "
35,"DOCTOR: Well, you won't need those for a start. "
36,"SARAH: Oh, we're going swimming, you said. "
37,DOCTOR: You can't sink on Florana. 
38,SARAH: I can sink anywhere. 
39,DOCTOR: The water's effervescent. The bubbles support you. 
40,SARAH: Like swimming in a glass of health salts. 
41,"DOCTOR: All right, but you wait until you've seen Florana. I always"
42,come back from Florana feeling a hundred years younger. 
43,(A red light is flashing on the console.) 
44,"DOCTOR: Ah, the air is like a magic potion. "
45,SARAH: Doctor? 
46,DOCTOR: And the beauty of it all is 
47,"SARAH: Doctor, should that red light be flashing? "
48,DOCTOR: We seem to have got a mains power 
49,(Flash bang! Sarah screams. The lights go out.) 
50,"SARAH: What is it, Doctor? What's happening? "
51,DOCTOR: I'm not sure. I'll cut in the emergency units. 
52,(Everything comes back on.) 
53,"DOCTOR: Well, that's a relief. If they hadn't worked, we'd have been in"
54,real trouble. 
55,(The lights fade out again.) 
56,"SARAH: Oh, it's starting again. "
57,(The Tardis crashes and throws the Doctor and Sarah to the floor before
58,landing unsteadily on that same planet. The lights continue to
59,fluctuate as they get to their feet.) 
60,"DOCTOR: Oh, there you are. Well, one thing's certain. We've landed. "
61,(The sound mutates into a sort of slow electronic wail.) 
62,SARAH: It's as if the Tardis was dying. 
63,"DOCTOR: Sarah, the scanner, quickly. There could be enough charge to"
64,operate it. 
65,(The scanner shows swirling mists before fading out.) 
66,"SARAH: Did you see anything, Doctor? "
67,"DOCTOR: Only fog. Fascinating, isn't it? "
68,SARAH: What's fascinating about fog? 
69,"DOCTOR: Well, perhaps that's what's put the Tardis out of action. "
70,(The lights go out and the Tardis goes quiet.) 
71,SARAH: Oh. Don't we have emergency storage cells or something? 
72,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. "
73,(But they only light things up for a couple of seconds.) 
74,SARAH: Dud battery? 
75,DOCTOR: Hardly. Listen. 
76,SARAH: I can't hear anything. 
77,"DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Not a click, not a tick. Nothing. The Tardis is a"
78,"living thing, thousands of instruments. Its energy sources never stop. "
79,SARAH: Well they have now. Everything's completely dead. 
80,"DOCTOR: Sarah, there's a torch in that cabinet. Get it for me, will"
81,you? 
82,(Sarah fishes around in a wooden box.) 
83,"SARAH: Oh, right. Ah, here we are. "
84,DOCTOR: Good. 
85,(The torch works.) 
86,SARAH: Ah. 
87,(And then fades out.) 
88,SARAH: Oh. Now what? 
89,"DOCTOR: Well, don't worry. I've got an oil lamp in here. That should be"
90,"all right. Yes, there it is. "
91,"SARAH: Ah, don't tell me. You're going to rub it and produce a genie. "
92,"DOCTOR: On the contrary, I'm going to light it and illumine us. "
93,SARAH: Ah! 
94,DOCTOR: There we are. 
95,"SARAH: Oh, hooray for old-fashioned oil. "
96,"DOCTOR: Well, we'll have to get it adjusted. That's better. Right now,"
97,let's see where we are. 
98,"SARAH: Florana, you said. "
99,"DOCTOR: Here, hold this for a minute, will you? Normally this door is"
100,power operated. We'll have to work it by hand. Where's that crank
101,handle? There it is. 
102,SARAH: Oh. 
103,"DOCTOR: Now bring the light over here, please. "
104,(The Doctor inserts the crank into a hole by the doors and turns it.
105,They open slowly.) 
106,DOCTOR: A bit more. Is that enough? 
107,SARAH: I think so. 
108,"DOCTOR: Good, right, that's enough. "
109,DOCTOR: Oh. Now follow me. Let's take a look. 
110,DOCTOR: All right? 
111,SARAH: Yes.
112,
113, [Exxilon]
114,
115,(They step out into an area with strange shaped
116,rocks.) 
117,SARAH: Oh! It's cold! 
118,"DOCTOR: Well, this is no ordinary fog. "
119,SARAH: You mean this isn't the air that's like a magic potion? 
120,"DOCTOR: It must be perfectly obvious to you, Sarah, that we've gone"
121,"ever so slightly astray, so sarcasm of that "
122,SARAH: Argh! 
123,"DOCTOR: Ah, it's all right. It's just rock. "
124,SARAH: A statue? 
125,"DOCTOR: No, some sort of life form that has become petrified, I should"
126,think. 
127,SARAH: I was close to becoming petrified myself. 
128,"DOCTOR: No, I doubt if anything has grown here for centuries. "
129,"SARAH: Well, unless you're planning on raising lettuce, it doesn't seem"
130,too important. 
131,"DOCTOR: Well, if the rest of the planet's like this, then life here"
132,certainly doesn't depend on photosynthesis. 
133,SARAH: What life? 
134,DOCTOR: Some power emanating from this planet has stopped the Tardis's
135,"energy banks. Now logically, that power can hardly be of geological"
136,origin. 
137,SARAH: You mean somebody or something has caused it? 
138,"DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. "
139,"SARAH: Right. Well, let's fix the Tardis and clear out. "
140,"DOCTOR: I'm sorry, I'm afraid we can't fix it. Not unless we discover"
141,the source of the power that's blocking us. 
142,"SARAH: Oh. Well, how are we going to do that? "
143,DOCTOR: I've no idea. 
144,(Something is moving by a rock nearby.) 
145,SARAH: You mean that we're? We're trapped? Stuck here for ever? 
146,"DOCTOR: Until we can discover the source of that energy loss, yes. "
147,"SARAH: Well, what do you want me to do? "
148,"DOCTOR: Well, I think to begin with, we must check the immediate area,"
149,don't you? 
150,"SARAH: Yes, right. Oh. Not really dressed for this climate, am I? "
151,"DOCTOR: Oh, for heaven's sake, girl, go and put something warm on. "
152,"SARAH: Yes, right. You won't go away, will you? "
153,(Sarah goes back into the darkened Tardis and puts on a long sleeved
154,Dress. The Doctor starts exploring the strange rock figures. He is
155,"followed by two life forms. Further along, he stops to examine the"
156,mineral content of the soil and gets jumped by a life form. Sarah pulls
157,on a pair of boots and leaves the Tardis.) 
158,SARAH: Doctor? Doctor? 
159,"(She moves off, searching, and is followed by a life form.) "
160,SARAH: Doctor? Doctor? Doctor? 
161,"(Sarah runs, and finds the oil lamp still flickering. She picks it up."
162,There is something wet and sticky on it.) 
163,SARAH: Blood. 
164,(Sarah throws away the lamp and runs back to the Tardis.)
165,
166, [Tardis]
167,
168, (One of the life forms is already inside when
169,Sarah enters.) 
170,SARAH: Doctor? 
171,(There are footsteps outside. Sarah looks out and sees two life forms
172,approaching. She goes inside and cranks the doors shut. When she has
173,"finished, the life form inside comes up behind her. It touches her, she"
174,turns and lashes out at it with the crank handle. It falls to the
175,"floor, she cranks the door open as it crawls towards her. It grabs her"
176,"leg, she hits it again and runs out into the night past two of its"
177,fellows.)
178,
179, [Exxilon]
180,
181, (The Doctor has had his hands tied and is being
182,led by a rope. He falls. The life form behind comes to help him up and
183,"he knocks it down, then attacks the leader, grabbing its axe and using"
184,its edge to cut his bonds. There is more fighting until the two life
185,"forms lie still, and he runs off. "
186,Sarah is evading her pursuers. She comes across a pulsing light and
187,walks towards it. It is a beacon on the top of a large white city. 
188,"Later, day is breaking, and the Doctor is still walking through rocks"
189,and gullies. Now we see clearly that the local life forms wear large
190,pieces of fabric that conceal their shape and are the same colour as
191,the rocks. One of them is following the Doctor when he spots something
192,partly concealed in the soil. It is a rope or wire pulled taut. The
193,"Doctor picks up a stone, backs away and throws it at the rope. A large"
194,rock balanced at the top of the crevasse tumbles down followed by a man
195,"in a space suit, wielding a knife. He attacks the Doctor. They"
196,"struggle, then a second man appears, and shouts as he runs down.) "
197,"RAILTON: Galloway! Galloway! You fool. He's not one of them. Sorry,"
198,"we've been a bit jumpy. We tend to attack first, ask questions after. "
199,GALLOWAY: (Scots) There's something moving. 
200,RAILTON: Let's get back to our base. We can talk there. 
201,(A life form watches them go.)
202,
203, [Outside MSC base]
204,
205, (A nervous guard with a bow and arrow is outside a
206,metallic triangle entrance. He hides when he hears someone
207,approaching.) 
208,"RAILTON: It's all right, Peter. He's quite friendly. "
209,GALLOWAY: We hope. 
210,"RAILTON: Keep a sharp watch, Peter. Dan heard some movement out there. "
211,"HAMILTON: Aye aye, sir. "
212, [MSC base]
213,
214, (An injured man lies on a bed with a woman looking
215,after him.) 
216,JILL: Did you find Jack? 
217,RAILTON: I'm afraid not. How is he? 
218,"JILL: He's not good, and we're down to our last pack of sulphagen"
219,"tablets, Richard. "
220,DOCTOR: What happened to him? 
221,"JILL: The Exxilons took us by surprise, right after we landed. "
222,GALLOWAY: These stone knives of theirs have got some sort of poison on
223,them. They're dirty wee fighters. 
224,"RAILTON: I'm sorry, perhaps we ought to introduce ourselves. I'm"
225,"Captain Railton, second in command of the expedition, and this is"
226,Commander Stewart. 
227,(The man on the bed.) 
228,"RAILTON: And that's Jill Tarrant, our civilian geologist. "
229,JILL: Are you from Earth? 
230,"DOCTOR: In a roundabout sort of way, yes. "
231,GALLOWAY: Dan Galloway. 
232,RAILTON: Lieutenant Galloway is our weapons officer. 
233,"DOCTOR: Well, it would have saved me a few bruises if we'd shaken hands"
234,"the first time we'd met. Hello, how do you do? "
235,RAILTON: The chap outside is Lieutenant Peter Hamilton. 
236,DOCTOR: Lieutenant? Are you a military expedition? 
237,RAILTON: MSC. 
238,DOCTOR: Master of Science? 
239,RAILTON: Marine Space Corps. 
240,GALLOWAY: Now maybe you'll tell us about yourself. Where were you
241,heading when I jumped you? 
242,DOCTOR: Back to the Tardis. That's my spaceship. I have a young
243,"companion with me, Sarah Jane Smith. I only hope she had the good sense"
244,to stay inside after I was captured. 
245,RAILTON: Where is the ship? 
246,DOCTOR: It's not far from here. 
247,"GALLOWAY: Oh, if the lassie stayed in your ship, she should be safe"
248,enough. 
249,"DOCTOR: Yes, if. Sarah's rather headstrong. By now, I expect she's out"
250,looking for me. 
251,"RAILTON: Well, even if she is, it needn't be too dangerous as long as"
252,she's careful. The Exxilons seem to be night creatures. 
253,JILL: We don't see much of them during the day. Just so long as she
254,didn't go near that forbidden city of theirs. 
255,DOCTOR: What forbidden city? 
256,RAILTON: Only their high priests can visit it. 
257,GALLOWAY: Anyone else they catch near it. 
258,(Galloway mimes throat-cutting.) 
259,GALLOWAY: That's their lot. 
260,JILL: They're sacrificed. 
261,"DOCTOR: Well, what is this place? Where is it? "
262,"RAILTON: Pass me the visual file, will you, Jill? We've got some"
263,pictures. Thank you. 
264,(The pictures are of the city that Sarah saw during the night.) 
265,RAILTON: It's a fantastic building. Must have been constructed
266,thousands of years ago. 
267,"JILL: And not by a stone age tribe like the Exxilons, either. "
268,"RAILTON: They treat it as a sort of shrine. If you're caught near it,"
269,it's certain death.
270,
271, [City wall]
272,
273," (The walls are of smooth, carved stone. There is a"
274,frieze of a C with a dot between its arms which rotates by 90 degrees
275,in batches of four. Sarah approaches and touches one long uncarved
276,"stone, which flashes briefly. She tries again with both hands then"
277,"moves on to the frieze, which also flashes upon her touch.) "
278,"SARAH: No doors, no windows. "
279,(An Exxilon comes up behind her and envelopes her in its 'cloak'.)
280,
281, [MSC base]
282,
283, (Mealtime.) 
284,"RAILTON: Then as soon as we got within range of Exxilon, we had total"
285,malfunction on all instruments. We managed to touch down without
286,"damaging the ship, but we can't take off again until we find some way"
287,of restoring power. 
288,"DOCTOR: Tell me, what's the purpose of your expedition? "
289,"JILL: Well, to collect parrinium. "
290,DOCTOR: Parrinium? 
291,"JILL: It's a chemical. It can be found in minute quantities on Earth,"
292,but it's so rare there that it's virtually priceless. A chemical
293,detecting satellite did a fly past on this planet and registered that
294,it was as common here as salt. 
295,"DOCTOR: Well, forgive me, but what do you want it for? "
296,"GALLOWAY: Och, man. Where have you been hiding? "
297,"DOCTOR: Well, here and there, one place and another. Well, I am a"
298,"little out of touch, I'll admit. "
299,"JILL: Well, the outer worlds are being ravaged by a disease. The"
300,"colonists are dying in their thousands. Another ten million men, women"
301,"and children will die unless we help them, and help them quickly. Every"
302,"hour we're stuck here on this planet, the death toll's mounting. "
303,DOCTOR: And parrinium will halt this disease? 
304,"RAILTON: Well, it can cure and give immunity, but they need it in"
305,quantity and they need it fast. 
306,"JILL: If it's not delivered within a month, it'll be too late. "
307,DOCTOR: I see. 
308,RAILTON: We managed to get a message off before we had total power
309,"failure, to Earth. We asked them for a relief ship. "
310,DOCTOR: Do you happen to know if that message was received? 
311,"GALLOWAY: Oh, if it had been I think we'd have had help by now. "
312,"DOCTOR: I think we can safely assume that no help is coming. So, might"
313,I make a suggestion 
314,(Hamilton bursts in.) 
315,"HAMILTON: The relief ship is here! Come on, quickly! "
316,(Hamilton runs out.) 
317,RAILTON: The relief ship? 
318,GALLOWAY: The relief ship's here.
319,
320,[Outside MSC base]
321,
322, RAILTON: Did you see it? 
323,"HAMILTON: No, I heard it, up in the haze. Over to the north a little"
324,bit. 
325,GALLOWAY: It's probably making a spiral descent. We should hear it
326,again in a moment. 
327,JILL: Here she comes! 
328,(A Mysteron style flying saucer whizzes across the sky.) 
329,RAILTON: They're landing in the next valley. Come on! 
330,(The Doctor and the four humans run off. Two Exxilons come out of
331,"hiding and enter the base, where the barely conscious Captain Stewart"
332,sees them.)
333,
334, [Cavern]
335,
336," (In a large stone cavern, a raised fire pit"
337,illumines a crowd of Exxilons and a wooden cage. The leader is in a
338,slightly different shade of brown to the others. Their faces can now be
339,seen. They look like bare skulls with massive blank eyes.) 
340,PRIEST: You have looked upon the sacred place. You have walked where
341,only the chosen may go. You have defiled the place of all power. 
342,"(Sarah is in the cage, tied up with her hands over her head. Two"
343,Exxilons enter the cage and unfasten Sarah then lead her out.) 
344,PRIEST: A judgment has been made. Prepare her for sacrifice! 
345,(Sarah starts to struggle.)
346,
347, [Landing site]
348,
349, JILL: It's over there! 
350,"HAMILTON: That doesn't look like an Earth ship, sir. "
351,"GALLOWAY: Well, maybe it's that new Z-47 they've been planning. "
352,RAILTON: She's not a Space Corps craft. 
353,"GALLOWAY: Well, I hope they haven't run into the same power block. "
354,DOCTOR: We'll know soon enough. 
355,(A hatch in the skirt of the saucer opens.) 
356,HAMILTON: Come on out! The welcome party's all here! 
357,(Out glide a party of oversized pepper pots.) 
358,DOCTOR: Daleks! 
359,DALEK: The Earth creatures are to be exterminated. Fire at my command. 
360,RAILTON: Wait a minute! Wait! You can't! 
361,"DALEK: Total extermination. Fire, fire, fire! "
362,(Everyone closes their eyes and waits to die.) 
363, Part Two
364,
365, [Landing site]
366,
367, (But the Dalek weapons do not put out any energy.)
368,
369,DALEK: Maximum power. Fire! Fire! Fire! 
370,(Still no deadly beams of energy.) 
371,DALEK: Weaponry malfunction. 
372,DALEK 2: Total power failure in armament circuits. 
373,"DOCTOR: Well, well, well. Daleks without the power to kill. How does it"
374,feel? 
375,DALEK: Keep away. Keep away! 
376,"DOCTOR: And if I don't, what will you do? Your weapons are totally"
377,"useless, affected by the same energy blackout that has stranded us. "
378,DALEK 2: The power failure is temporary. Superior Dalek technology will
379,"overcome interference shortly. Meanwhile, you will obey our orders. "
380,"DOCTOR: You're not in a position to give any orders. No, no, we're all"
381,"in this together. All equal, all powerless. "
382,DALEK: The Daleks are the supreme beings of the universe. Dalek
383,technology is the 
384,RAILTON: Spare us the propaganda. I think our best interest will be
385,served by joining forces. 
386,DALEK: Daleks do not require the co-operation of inferior creatures. 
387,"RAILTON: Think about it. There are four of you and five of us, and this"
388,planet is swarming with creatures that want to destroy us. That's a
389,fact that must penetrate even Dalek arrogance. 
390,DALEK: We will confer. 
391,"DOCTOR: Well, they may agree with your plan, Captain, but I advise you,"
392,don't trust them. 
393,RAILTON: We need all the help we can get. 
394,JILL: That's true. 
395,GALLOWAY: We don't need the Daleks. There's nothing they can do that we
396,"can't do on our own, sir. "
397,DOCTOR: They're brilliant technicians. It was their inventive genius
398,"that made them one of the greatest powers in the universe, remember"
399,that. 
400,RAILTON: Quite. They might find a way out of this spot. 
401,"HAMILTON: My father was killed in the last Dalek war, sir. I hate the"
402,thought of working with them. 
403,RAILTON: He was one man. Ten million will die if we don't get off the
404,planet with the medical supplies. 
405,"DOCTOR: Well, whatever they're going to do, I hope they decide quickly."
406,
407,"(Meanwhile, in the cavern Sarah is in front of the fire pit. The"
408,Exxilons are chanting.) 
409,"HAMILTON: What do you think, Dan? "
410,GALLOWAY: Mmm? 
411,HAMILTON: About this idea. Cooperating with Daleks. 
412,"GALLOWAY: Well, it might work for the while. "
413,HAMILTON: I think the Captain's gone soft. 
414,"GALLOWAY: Oh, he's scared of the wee salt-shakers. I saw his face when"
415,they came out of that ship. 
416,"HAMILTON: Ah, the spokesman's coming back. "
417,"RAILTON: Well, what did they say? "
418,"DOCTOR: I think they'll go for it. Mind you, they haven't much choice,"
419,but I must warn you again. Don't you trust them an inch. 
420,JILL: Did you manage to find out what they're doing here? 
421,DOCTOR: Yes. Several of the planets the Daleks have colonised are
422,suffering from the same disease. They're dying in millions. Now they
423,need that chemical just as badly as you do. That's why I think they'll
424,cooperate. 
425,"(A little way away, the Daleks are talking.) "
426,DALEK 2: It is agreed. 
427,DALEK 3: We will cooperate until they are no further use to us. 
428,DALEK: And the true reason that we need the chemical parrinium must
429,remain secret. 
430,DALEK 3: It is understood. 
431,DALEK: They must continue to believe there are only four of us. 
432,DALEK 2: It is understood. 
433,"DOCTOR: Well, have you decided? "
434,"DALEK: Yes, Doctor. The truce exists between our party and yours. "
435,DOCTOR: A very wise decision. 
436,DALEK: The truce ends when power is restored. 
437,RAILTON: We agree. And now I think we should all go over to the mining
438,dome. 
439,DALEK: Mining dome? 
440,"JILL: We've located a parrinium strata, and set up a dome nearby where"
441,we can refine the ore. 
442,RAILTON: But it's pretty slow work without power. Perhaps you can
443,suggest some quicker technique? 
444,DALEK: Very well. Lead the way. Lead! Lead! 
445, [Exxilon]
446,
447, (The MSC base is wrecked and empty. Captain
448,Stewart is missing. Railton leads the five people and three Daleks. In
449,"a dried river bed, the Doctor spots soil tumbling down the steep sides."
450,Everyone stops and looks around. Railton gets shot in the back by an
451,arrow.) 
452,DOCTOR: Take cover! 
453,DALEK: Locate the enemy! Locate the enemy! Locate! Locate! Locate!
454,Locate! Locate! 
455,"(Jill runs to Railton, but he is dead. Exxilons appear on the skyline"
456,above them.) 
457,DALEK: Locate! Locate! 
458,(The men run to a dug out depression to hide.) 
459,DALEK: Locate! Locate! 
460,JILL: Help me with him! Help me! 
461,DOCTOR: It's no good. We can't help him. 
462,"JILL: But please, we can't leave him here. "
463,(More arrows thud into the ground nearby.) 
464,"DOCTOR: Quick, come on. Out, come on. "
465,(He drags her to where the others are sheltering.) 
466,"DOCTOR: Come on, down here. Which way did they come from? "
467,GALLOWAY: I don't know. 
468,DOCTOR: Down! 
469,(They hide behind the thick sand dune.) 
470,"DOCTOR: Our only chance is that it's a small group, then we might make"
471,a break for it. 
472,"GALLOWAY: Well, I'm next in seniority to the Captain. That puts me in"
473,command. 
474,"DOCTOR: Just a suggestion, that's all. "
475,"JILL: All right, Commander, give an order to get us out of this. "
476,(Another group of Exxilons have appeared.) 
477,HAMILTON: Over there! 
478,(But an arrow thuds into the dune by the Doctor's head. There are more
479,"behind them, too.) "
480,DOCTOR: So it was a large group. 
481,(Galloway shoots an Exxilon. The group flatten themselves at the bottom
482,of the dug out as arrows and spears come at them from all angles.) 
483,DALEK: Exterminate! Exterminate! 
484,(The Exxilons rush them.) 
485,DALEK: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! 
486,(The Exxilons batter the annoying Dalek.) 
487,"DALEK: Am losing control! Am losing control! Am loosing, am loosing, am"
488,losing control! Am losing control! 
489,(Smoke pours out of the Dalek case. Everyone backs away and it goes
490,Bang! then catches fire. The humans risk taking a look as the Exxilons
491,dance around the bonfire. A procession approaches and the Exxilons run
492,over to meet it.) 
493,DOCTOR: What's going on over there? 
494,JILL: They've got Commander Stewart. 
495,STEWART: Give yourselves up. 
496,HAMILTON: That settles it for me. Jill? 
497,JILL: Yes. 
498,"HAMILTON: What about you, Doctor? "
499,"DOCTOR: Certainly, when the only alternative to living is dying. All"
500,"right. Come on, let's get it over with. "
501,"(The Doctor leads Jill and Hamilton out of the hole. After a moment,"
502,Galloway puts down his bow and follows.)
503,
504, [Landing site]
505,
506,(A Dalek reports back to two others.) 
507,DALEK: Patrol captured by alien beings. One Dalek destroyed. 
508,DALEK 2: We will report.
509,
510, [Cavern]
511,
512, (The chanting continues as the High Priest waves a
513,"smoking bowl under Sarah's nose, making her inhale the fumes."
514,Eventually she passes out. The new prisoners are escorted in.) 
515,DOCTOR: Sarah! What are you doing with her? 
516,PRIEST: She has defiled the place of our gods. She is to be sacrificed.
517,
518,(The Doctor breaks free of his escort with a Hai! and rushes towards
519,"the Priest. There is a brief m�l�e, but the Doctor is overcome by"
520,superior numbers.)
521,
522, [Cavern - cage] 
523, (Sarah comes to. Also in the cage are the other
524,humans and the Daleks. Jill is tending the Doctor who is lying on a
525,stone slab.) 
526,SARAH: Is the Doctor all right? 
527,JILL: I think so. He's coming round. But are you okay? 
528,"SARAH: Mmm. Er, they made me inhale some sort of incense. Well, what"
529,happened? 
530,"JILL: Well, I'm not too sure myself, but neither of you is very"
531,popular. The Doctor attacked their High Priest. From what we can
532,"gather, that's about the worst crime you can commit on this planet. "
533,(Commander Stewart is on another slab with Hamilton tending to him.) 
534,GALLOWAY: (sotto) Crazy. He must be crazy. He's blown any chance we
535,ever had a making a deal with these savages. 
536,"HAMILTON: (sotto) We hadn't much choice, Dan. A couple of minutes more"
537,that girl would've been dead. 
538,GALLOWAY: (sotto) So? 
539,"HAMILTON: (sotto) Look, we're all in this together. It could have been"
540,me or you. Do you expect everybody else to stand by and let it happen? 
541,GALLOWAY: (sotto) The point is it wasn't us. We have no loyalties to
542,them. They're not part of our mission. 
543,"HAMILTON: (sotto) So you'll let them die, just like that? "
544,GALLOWAY: (sotto) I would so. Our job is to get medical relief that'll
545,save the lives of millions. If some people we don't even know have to
546,"die in the process, well, that's just too bad. "
547,DALEK: We have decided the action we will take. We will offer the
548,Exxilons our knowledge and technology in return for their assistance. 
549,"GALLOWAY: Well, anything's worth a try. "
550,HAMILTON: (sotto) What about those two? Do you think they'll agree to
551,let them go? 
552,DALEK: The Doctor is an old enemy of the Daleks. The girl is
553,unimportant. Guard! I will speak with the High Priest. 
554,(The Doctor is awake and sitting up.) 
555,"JILL: I don't know what they're up to, but I don't like it. "
556,DOCTOR: I have a feeling it might be better if you did not associate
557,yourself too closely with us. I think we're the flies in a jar of very
558,nasty ointment. 
559,SARAH: What do you think will happen? 
560,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm afraid that what they had planned for you has merely"
561,been postponed. I think they'll be two of us in the next performance. 
562,EXXILON: The High Priest will speak with you. 
563,(The Dalek is let out of the cage.) 
564,JILL: They may be trying to negotiate a way for all of us to get out of
565,this. 
566,"DOCTOR: No, that's pure wishful thinking, Jill. The Daleks won't give"
567,us any loyalty and I don't expect too much help from your space chums
568,either.
569,
570, [Dalek spaceship]
571,
572, (The Daleks are using a model Tardis for target
573,"practice with their modified weaponry, which fires bullets instead of"
574,energy.) 
575,DALEK: Target model destroyed. 
576,DALEK 2: Substitute weaponry functioning satisfactorily. 
577,DALEK: We will proceed immediately.
578,
579, [Landing site]
580,
581, (Two Exxilons are on a ridge overlooking the
582,spaceship hatch. Two Daleks come out and a third stays inside. The
583,Daleks spot them and shoot them.) 
584,DALEK 2: Primitive weapons moderately efficient.
585,
586, [Cavern - cage]
587,
588, (The chanting has started up again. Two Exxilons
589,enter the cage and indicate that the Doctor and Sarah are to follow
590,them.) 
591,HAMILTON: We've got to do something! 
592,GALLOWAY: Don't interfere. We've got think of ourselves now and what we
593,came here to do. 
594,DALEK: It is agreed. The Exxilons will discuss terms when the
595,sacrifices are completed. You will follow and observe. 
596,(The humans and Daleks leave the cage.) 
597,"STEWART: Galloway. Galloway, you're not fit to command. "
598,"GALLOWAY: I'm doing what's necessary, sir. I'll get that chemical to"
599,the peoples of the outer worlds whatever it costs. 
600,"STEWART: Not for them, Galloway, for yourself. You're a glory seeker."
601,This may be the last order that I can give but I'm appointing Hamilton
602,as leader. 
603,GALLOWAY: You can't do that. 
604,STEWART: It's already done. It's an order. Peter'll take command. 
605,(Stewart dies.) 
606,"GALLOWAY: I'm sorry, Commander. Couldn't quite hear what you said."
607,
608, [Cavern]
609,
610,(The Doctor and Sarah are being held in front of
611,"the fire pit, and the High Priest brings the bowl of incense for them"
612,to inhale. Other Exxilons hold their heads so they cannot turn away
613,"from the smoke. Then the 'primitively armed' Daleks enter, firing. In"
614,"the confusion, the Doctor grabs Sarah and they make a run for it.) "
615,GALLOWAY: Come on! 
616,"(The Doctor and Sarah climb onto the altar, which has a tunnel behind"
617,it.) 
618,"DOCTOR: Right, come on, jump! Jump!"
619,
620, [Tunnel]
621,
622," DOCTOR: Right, come on. (a few steps along) Stay"
623,there. 
624,(He peers back into the cavern.) 
625,DOCTOR: The Daleks don't seem to be following us. 
626,"SARAH: Oh, those robot things, are they locals? "
627,DOCTOR: Hardly. They're probably the most technically advanced and
628,ruthless life form in the galaxy. 
629,"SARAH: But if they're robots, how is it their power's not affected?"
630,They can't half move. 
631,"DOCTOR: Because they're only half robot, Sarah. Inside each of those"
632,"shells is a living, bubbling lump of hate. "
633,SARAH: You mean they've got legs? 
634,"DOCTOR: No, they move by psychokinetic power. "
635,SARAH: I see. 
636,DOCTOR: Do you? 
637,SARAH: No.
638,
639, [Cavern]
640,
641,(The Daleks are rounding up the surviving Exxilons
642,"and herding them into the cage, where Jill and Hamilton had taken"
643,cover.) 
644,DALEK 2: All resistance has ceased. 
645,DALEK: I will speak with the High Priest. Bring him to me. 
646,DALEK 3: I obey. 
647,"GALLOWAY: Oh, what do you want to speak to him about? "
648,"DALEK: We require the cooperation of the Exxilons, but now they will do"
649,so on our terms. 
650,GALLOWAY: And if they don't agree? 
651,DALEK: We will select groups of hostages for extermination until they
652,do. 
653,"GALLOWAY: Aye, that should bring them around to our way of thinking."
654,One of the first things we should do is to make them supply working
655,parties to mine the parrinium. 
656,DALEK: Your advice is not required. 
657,"GALLOWAY: Now, wait a minute. We agreed. We're working together. "
658,DALEK: We are in command! You will obey our orders!
659,
660, [Tunnel]
661,
662, SARAH: Doctor! We were just playing the main part
663,"in a sacrificial ceremony, weren't we? "
664,"DOCTOR: Well, that seemed to be the general idea, yes. "
665,SARAH: Well how are they going to sacrifice us just by dumping us down
666,here? 
667,"DOCTOR: Yes, I knew that thought would occur to you sooner or later. "
668,"SARAH: You've got an idea, haven't you? "
669,DOCTOR: Yes. And it's not one of my favourites. In fact I don't care
670,for it at all. 
671,"SARAH: Well, you might as well share it. "
672,"DOCTOR: Oh, very well. I think they expect that sacrifice to be"
673,completed by something else. Something that lives down this tunnel. 
674,(And right on cue comes a warbling sort of roar.) 
675,"SARAH: Next time you get an idea, keep it to yourself, will you. "
676, [Cavern]
677,
678, DALEK: It is agreed. You will accompany us. 
679,(The Daleks lead the High Priest away. Jill and Hamilton are out of the
680,cage.) 
681,JILL: What's happening? 
682,"GALLOWAY: Well, it's practically all agreed. We've done a deal with the"
683,Exxilons. 
684,HAMILTON: We? 
685,"GALLOWAY: Well, they'll provide a working force to help us mine the"
686,parrinium. We'll be in charge of that with two of the Daleks. 
687,JILL: And the other Daleks? 
688,"GALLOWAY: Well, they'll investigate the cause of the electrical"
689,interference. 
690,HAMILTON: And what are the Exxilons getting in return? 
691,"GALLOWAY: Oh, not much. "
692,"JILL: Well, tell us. "
693,"GALLOWAY: Well, apparently the Exxilons have only one enemy, a sort of"
694,"breakaway group. Well, we've agreed to help wipe them out. "
695,HAMILTON: You've what? 
696,GALLOWAY: In return we get the parrinium we need. We'll save millions
697,of lives. 
698,JILL: And murder others? You can't accept those terms. 
699,GALLOWAY: The creatures on this planet are primitives. They don't
700,count. 
701,HAMILTON: What else have you agreed? 
702,"GALLOWAY: Aye, well, this is the bit you're not going to like. "
703,JILL: I haven't liked any of it so far. 
704,"GALLOWAY: That fellow they call the Doctor and the girl, they have to"
705,"be brought back, dead or alive. "
706,"HAMILTON: You're totally ruthless, aren't you, Galloway. "
707,"GALLOWAY: The Daleks have gone down the tunnel after them, just in case"
708,the creatures that live down there don't get them first.
709,
710, [Tunnel]
711,
712, (Another wibbly roar.) 
713,SARAH: That sounded awfully close. 
714,"DOCTOR: Yes. Some sort of subterranean wind effect, I should think. "
715,(And another.) 
716,SARAH: Who are you kidding? 
717,"DOCTOR: Myself, chiefly. "
718,"(Two Daleks enter the tunnel. As the Doctor and Sarah walk on,"
719,something very similar to an Exxilon starts to follow them. They come
720,to a junction lit by candles on ledges. The roar again.) 
721,"SARAH: I just heard your wind effect gnashing its teeth. Well, which"
722,way now? 
723,DOCTOR: I think I'll make a short reconnaissance down this tunnel here.
724,Alone. 
725,SARAH: Alone? 
726,"DOCTOR: Look, Sarah, I don't want anything creeping down behind me and"
727,"blocking off my retreat, now do I? With you here on watch you can give"
728,me a warning. 
729,"SARAH: Well, who's going to warn me? "
730,DOCTOR: You're in a perfectly safe place here. You've got three
731,different ways to run. 
732,SARAH: Oh! 
733,DOCTOR: I think I'll just go down it for about half a mile. If it holds
734,"any promise, I'll be right back. All right? "
735,"SARAH: I suppose so. Good luck, Doctor. "
736,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
737,"(The Doctor leaves. Sarah looks around, but doesn't notice that she is"
738,being watched. After a little while -) 
739,SARAH: Somebody there? 
740,"(Sarah paces a little more, then she turns and sees her follower."
741,"Meanwhile, the Doctor has come across a one-eyed metallic snake-like"
742,creature which appears to be first cousin of the things in the learning
743,hall in The
744,Krotons.) 
745, Part Three
746,
747,[Tunnel]
748,
749, (The metal snake rears up and strikes at the
750,Doctor. He falls backwards and it hits the rock wall with a flash of
751,energy. It gathers itself for another strike and he rolls away just in
752,"time. Back at the junction, Sarah's follower is emerging from a crevice"
753,in the wall.) 
754,"SARAH: Oh, keep away from me! Keep back! "
755,(The creature holds out a hand. He has florescent stripes on his skin.)
756,
757,BELLAL: Please. 
758,SARAH: Who are you? 
759,BELLAL: I am called Bellal. I mean you no harm. I will help you if I
760,can. I do not share the beliefs of those who would have killed you.
761,They consider that I and others like me are their enemies. 
762,SARAH: And are you? 
763,"BELLAL: Oh, no. We seek merely to save the Exxilon race from"
764,extinction. We do not share their beliefs and for that reason we are
765,persecuted and driven to live in the secret places beneath the surface.
766,
767,SARAH: How many of you are there? 
768,"(Sarah is dodging around, trying to avoid being touched.) "
769,"BELLAL: Very few against so many. I will answer all your questions, but"
770,first we must go from here. We have a place that is safe. Follow me and
771,I will take you to it. 
772,SARAH: I can't. I'm waiting for the Doctor. 
773,BELLAL: Which path did he take? 
774,SARAH: That one. 
775,BELLAL: Ah! 
776,"SARAH: Well, what is it? "
777,BELLAL: That way leads to death. 
778,SARAH: Well you've got to help him! 
779,BELLAL: No. 
780,"SARAH: Oh, please! "
781,(The metallic roar is heard.) 
782,"BELLAL: It may already be too late, but we will do what can be done. "
783,(Another of Bellal's tribe of Exxilons enters.) 
784,"GOTAL: The creatures from the spacecraft, two of them, coming this way."
785,
786,BELLAL: Machine creatures? 
787,SARAH: Daleks! 
788,BELLAL: Here. 
789,(They all hide behind a rock.) 
790,DALEK: We will search independently. Fugitives are to be exterminated
791,on sight. 
792,DALEK 2: I obey. 
793,(The first Dalek goes down the tunnel the Doctor took.) 
794,SARAH: He'll be coming up behind the Doctor. I must warn him! 
795,"BELLAL: No, no, it will be no use. You must stay silent or you will"
796,destroy us all. You must understand! It is beyond our power to help him
797,now. 
798,SARAH: Doctor. 
799,"(The Doctor is edging along a side tunnel, and the metal snake is"
800,hunting him. The Dalek arrives on the scene and shoots at the snake
801,"without hesitation. The snake strikes at the Dalek, making it go bang.)"
802,
803,"DOCTOR: Oh, good shot, sir. "
804,(The Dalek catches fire but keeps shooting.) 
805,"DOCTOR: A hit! Yes, a palpable hit! "
806,"(Finally the snake kills the Dalek. Back at the junction, the fight has"
807,been heard. Sarah heads for the tunnel.) 
808,BELLAL: No! 
809,SARAH: I must. 
810,BELLAL: The other Dalek will have heard. He'll be coming back. 
811,SARAH: The Doctor may be hurt. 
812,GOTAL: We must hurry! 
813,"BELLAL: As soon as it's safe, I'll have some of my people look for your"
814,friend but now we. Something coming! 
815,GOTAL: Quick! 
816,BELLAL: Quick! 
817,SARAH: Quick! 
818,(The Exxilons run off and Sarah hides behind the rock again. A Dalek
819,weapon stick emerges slowly from the tunnel - held by the Doctor.) 
820,"SARAH: Doctor! Oh, you're safe! Oh, what happened? Oh, how did you get"
821,away from the Dalek? What did you see down there? 
822,"DOCTOR: All right. All right, all right, all right, all right. Just a"
823,"moment, just a moment! I've just had a face to face confrontation with"
824,a rather nasty root. It obviously wasn't very fond of me but it
825,positively hated the Dalek. 
826,SARAH: Did you say root? 
827,"DOCTOR: Yes, it must have been one of those sort of underground support"
828,"systems for the city, I should imagine. "
829,"SARAH: Well, what happened to the Dalek? "
830,"DOCTOR: The root, one. "
831,SARAH: Mmm? 
832,"DOCTOR: Dalek, nil. In fact, this was about the only part of it that"
833,was left undamaged. 
834,(Bellal and Gotal reappear.) 
835,"SARAH: No! Doctor, they're friends. "
836,BELLAL: The other Dalek is coming this way. 
837,SARAH: Oh! 
838,DOCTOR: Sarah? Who are your shining friends? 
839,"SARAH: Oh, time for that later, Doctor. Come on!"
840,(They run off after the Exxilons just before the second Dalek appears
841,and looks around. It follows them.) 
842,BELLAL: You must move more quickly! The Dalek is coming this way. 
843,SARAH: It's a dead end! 
844,"GOTAL: No, we go through there. It widens out after a little. "
845,"DOCTOR: You first. Go on, Sarah. "
846,(Sarah squeezes into the crevice in the rock wall.) 
847,GOTAL: Now you. Give me that. 
848,DOCTOR: I really must go on a diet one of these days. Give me your
849,hand! 
850,SARAH: Oh! 
851,(Sarah pulls the Doctor through the crack.) 
852,DOCTOR: Come on. 
853,(The Dalek spots the Exxilons vanishing into the rock.) 
854,DALEK: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!
855,
856,(It fires its gun through the crack. The bullets ricochet around the
857,chamber then the Dalek leaves.)
858,
859, [Tunnel chamber]
860,
861, DOCTOR: It's all right. He seems to have gone. Is
862,anyone hurt? 
863,"SARAH: Ah, I don't think so. "
864,BELLAL: We're safe now. 
865,DOCTOR: We can't sit around underground forever. There are things we
866,must do. 
867,SARAH: Such as? 
868,"DOCTOR: Well, get the power back into our spaceships, for one thing."
869,"And for another, do everything we can to help that Earth mission ship. "
870,"SARAH: Well, they'll be all right. They seemed pretty pally with the"
871,Daleks. 
872,"DOCTOR: You take it from me, Sarah. The moment they cease to be of use"
873,"to the Daleks, they'll wipe them out without a qualm. "
874,BELLAL: My people are watching them. They will report immediately what
875,happens. 
876, [Parrinium mine]
877,
878, (One of Bellal's people is watching the cloaked
879,Exxilons sieve for the ore by a pool.) 
880,DALEK: The Exxilons are working too slowly. 
881,"GALLOWAY: Well, with the primitive equipment they're using, I'm not"
882,surprised. 
883,DALEK: Then the workforce must be increased. You will arrange it. 
884,"GALLOWAY: Look, the High Priest wasn't all that cooperative. We were"
885,lucky to get this many workers. 
886,DALEK: More workers! More workers! More! Exxilons will obey our
887,commands! 
888,GALLOWAY: And if they don't? 
889,DALEK: Their leaders will be exterminated. 
890,GALLOWAY: But we made an agreement. 
891,DALEK: It was expedient. You will advise the High Priest that his
892,people will comply with Dalek law or suffer the consequences. 
893,GALLOWAY: I can't tell him that! 
894,DALEK: You will obey! You will obey! You will obey! You will obey! You
895,will obey! 
896,(The Dalek glides off.) 
897,"GALLOWAY: All right, you lot. Put your backs into it. Get going. Come"
898,"on! You're idle, idle, idle!"
899,
900, [Dalek spaceship]
901,
902,(The Daleks report to another that appears to be
903,gold coloured.) 
904,GOLD: This planet is now under Dalek control. Our commands will be
905,obeyed. Those who resist will be exterminated.
906,
907, [Tunnel]
908,
909,(The party are in another candle lit tunnel.) 
910,BELLAL: Exxilon had grown old before life had even begun on other
911,"planets. Our ancestors solved the mysteries of science, built craft"
912,that travelled through space. They were the supreme beings of the
913,universe. 
914,"DOCTOR: What destroyed their power, war? "
915,BELLAL: No. They created their own destruction. Using all their
916,"knowledge, they built a city that would last through all of time. "
917,SARAH: And they succeeded. It looked as though it was built only
918,yesterday. 
919,BELLAL: They used their sciences to make the city into a living thing.
920,"It could protect itself, repair itself, maintain itself. They even gave"
921,it a brain. 
922,"DOCTOR: I see. So the city became an entity, though greater and more"
923,powerful than the many small parts that had created it. 
924,"BELLAL: Yes, it then had no need of those who had made it. Our people"
925,had created a monster. They tried to destroy it. Instead it destroyed
926,"them and drove out the survivors. Now we, and the other Exxilons you"
927,"met, are all that remain. "
928,SARAH: What separates you from the others? 
929,BELLAL: They have made the city their god. They worship and fear it.
930,They even make sacrifices to it. 
931,"SARAH: Yes, we almost qualified for that ourselves. "
932,"DOCTOR: Yet you don't fear the city, Bellal. Why? "
933,"BELLAL: Yes, we do fear it, but we don't worship it. Our aim is to"
934,"destroy it. Unless we succeed, our race will vanish from this planet. "
935,"DOCTOR: Yes. Well, I think the time has come to do something about this"
936,city.
937,
938, [Parrinium mine]
939,
940, DALEK: The explosive charges will be completed
941,shortly. 
942,DALEK 2: The charges must be placed on the beacon on the summit of the
943,city and detonated. 
944,DALEK: Agreed. A Dalek patrol will enter the city to investigate
945,scientific installations while the explosives are being positioned. 
946,DALEK 3: Will destruction of the beacon restore electrical energy? 
947,DALEK: All logical evidence suggests it is the source of interference. 
948,(A metal snake-root emerges from the pool. The three Exxilons in the
949,water panic.) 
950,HAMILTON: Come on! Get out of it! 
951,"(Two get to shore, the third is close to the snake-root.) "
952,JILL: Peter? 
953,(It rears up and strikes. The Exxilon's cloak bursts into flames. He
954,writhes then finally falls back under the water. Hamilton leads Jill
955,"away. A Dalek above the pool starts shooting, so the root strikes at it"
956,and it bursts into flames.) 
957,DALEK: Exterminate! Am losing control! Am losing control! Am 
958,"(The Dalek tumbles into the pool. The humans, Exxilons and the two"
959,remaining Daleks watch the root slither back underwater.)
960,
961, [Tunnel]
962,
963,(Bellal is writing on the tunnel wall.) 
964,DOCTOR: You say that markings like these are cut into the walls of the
965,city? 
966,"BELLAL: Yes, these are as I remember them. "
967,"SARAH: I saw them too, Doctor. Do they mean anything to you? "
968,"DOCTOR: No, not fully. But I do have a rough idea of what they're"
969,"intended to convey. You see, I've seen them before. "
970,SARAH: Seen them before? Where? 
971,DOCTOR: On the walls of a temple in Peru. 
972,"SARAH: Oh, that's impossible! "
973,"DOCTOR: Yeah, that's what they said about the Peruvian temple as well."
974,"Yes, it's one of Earth's great mysteries, that no primitive man could"
975,"possibly have built such a structure. Well, now we've solved it. "
976,SARAH: Solved how a temple was built in Peru? 
977,DOCTOR: You say that your ancestors were travelling in space when other
978,worlds were still primitive? 
979,"BELLAL: Why, that is true. "
980,DOCTOR: Then they almost certainly visited Earth and taught the people
981,there how to build. 
982,BELLAL: Our city supports itself in two ways. Through roots in the
983,ground and through the air. 
984,SARAH: The air? 
985,"DOCTOR: Yes, they must drain their electrical energy from the"
986,"atmosphere, probably via that beacon. "
987,SARAH: So that's what put the mockers on the Tardis? 
988,"DOCTOR: Well, you seem to have a crude grasp of the general idea, yes. "
989,(A third Exxilon whispers to Gotal.) 
990,BELLAL: What is it? 
991,GOTAL: One of the machine creatures has been destroyed by a probe at
992,the diggings. 
993,SARAH: A what? Where? 
994,DOCTOR: Another of our Dalek friends has had root trouble.
995,
996, [Parrinium mine]
997,
998,(A third Dalek arrives.) 
999,DALEK: Mining will recommence in new area immediately. Move! Move!
1000,Move! Move! 
1001,(The Exxilons are taken away.) 
1002,DALEK 2: (to Jill) You will go with them. 
1003,HAMILTON: We stay together. 
1004,DALEK 2: You will obey! You will obey! 
1005,"JILL: It's all right, Peter. One of us has to select the parrinium from"
1006,the digging. 
1007,HAMILTON: But 
1008,JILL: Don't worry. I can take care of myself. 
1009,(Jill follows the Exxilons.) 
1010,DALEK 2: Patrol will leave immediately to enter city and make
1011,scientific survey. 
1012,DALEKS: We obey. 
1013,(Two Daleks leave.) 
1014,DALEK 2: You will accompany me to position explosive. 
1015,HAMILTON: You're in command. What do we do? 
1016,GALLOWAY: Exactly as it says. 
1017,DALEK 2: We leave immediately. Move! Move!
1018,
1019, [Near the City]
1020,
1021,(Bellal is carrying the Dalek gun. The Doctor
1022,whistles at the sight of the gleaming structure.) 
1023,DOCTOR: Well. Now that must be one of the seven hundred wonders of the
1024,universe. 
1025,SARAH: It's even more impressive when we get close. 
1026,DOCTOR: I'm afraid you're not going any closer. 
1027,"SARAH: What? Oh now, look, Doctor. "
1028,DOCTOR: I've got something far more important for you to do. 
1029,SARAH: You just don't want to be lumbered with me. 
1030,"DOCTOR: Sarah, if that Earth rocket doesn't get away from here,"
1031,millions of people are going to die. 
1032,"SARAH: All right, Doctor, what do you want me to do? "
1033,DOCTOR: I want you to make Galloway and his friends understand they've
1034,got to get the parrinium aboard that ship and be ready for blast off
1035,the moment the power is restored. Now remember the Daleks will be fully
1036,powered too and they'll do everything they can to destroy the Earth
1037,ship. 
1038,SARAH: You think that's what they're intending? 
1039,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm certain of it. I know the Daleks and they're not"
1040,medical missionaries. 
1041,"SARAH: I'll tell them, Doctor. Well, Bellal is getting impatient. You'd"
1042,better go. 
1043,"DOCTOR: Good girl. You'll take care of yourself, won't you? "
1044,SARAH: And you. 
1045,DOCTOR: There's just one more thing. If I don't come back. 
1046,SARAH: Hmm? 
1047,DOCTOR: You must go with them. 
1048, [Outside the City]
1049,
1050, DOCTOR: It's beautiful. Beautiful. 
1051,"BELLAL: To you perhaps. To us, it is evil. "
1052,"(Bellal touches the blank stone, and it glows.) "
1053,DOCTOR: Touch sensitised. That's brilliant. 
1054,BELLAL: You wanted to see the symbols? 
1055,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1056,BELLAL: They are here. I have tried to interpret them many times. 
1057,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's difficult, very difficult. "
1058,BELLAL: Do they have any meaning for you? 
1059,"DOCTOR: Vaguely, but I "
1060,BELLAL: They continue round here. 
1061,(They go into an alcove which has three rows of different symbols.
1062,Bellal touches them to light them up. The two Daleks arrive at the
1063,City.) 
1064,DOCTOR: I think I have something here. These symbols don't conform. 
1065,BELLAL: Daleks! 
1066,DOCTOR: Where? 
1067,BELLAL: There. 
1068,(The Daleks start shooting.) 
1069,BELLAL: Get back! 
1070,(The Doctor turns to the symbols again as the Daleks approach. We hear
1071,the noise of a mechanism. The Daleks arrive at the alcove and stop
1072,shooting. There is no one there.) 
1073,DALEK: Continue search.
1074,
1075, [City entrance hall]
1076,
1077, (The Doctor and Bellal are by a blank square in a
1078,white wall. Nearby are the desiccated remains of Exxilons.) 
1079,BELLAL: What did you do? 
1080,"DOCTOR: Well, I simply picked out the symbol that appeared to be"
1081,different and traced its outline on the wall. 
1082,BELLAL: And that made it slide open? 
1083,"DOCTOR: Well, I can't think what else. "
1084,BELLAL: Can we get out again? 
1085,DOCTOR: I should think that is extremely unlikely. He didn't get out
1086,"again, did he. "
1087,BELLAL: We've walked into a trap. 
1088,"DOCTOR: No, no. No, that doesn't just make sense. "
1089,BELLAL: But these. Some of them must have been here for centuries. 
1090,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. They got this far then they couldn't pass"
1091,the next intelligence test. 
1092,BELLAL: What test? 
1093,"DOCTOR: I'm not sure yet. Logically, there must be one. "
1094,(The Doctor spots a wall panel with markings on it. He touches it and a
1095,pattern lights up.) 
1096,"DOCTOR: Ah, yes. Yes, just as I thought. Good. Good. Splendid. In fact,"
1097,capital! 
1098,BELLAL: But I don't understand. This is simply a pattern on the wall. 
1099,"DOCTOR: Oh, no, no. It's much more than that. It's a maze. A test of"
1100,skill and logic that we have to pass before we can move deeper into the
1101,city. 
1102,BELLAL: And if we fail? 
1103,"DOCTOR: Well then, we shall simply add to these decorations. "
1104,(Bellal puts his hand on the wall so the Doctor can examine the maze
1105,more closely.) 
1106,"DOCTOR: Right, let's see what we've got here. Well, there's a point of"
1107,"entry here. The exit down there. Now as this wall is touch sensitised,"
1108,"simply by moving my finger along the correct route, should register"
1109,"success or failure. All right, well, here goes."
1110,
1111,[Outside the City]
1112,
1113, DALEK: Computer eye indicates the symbols provide
1114,a simple logic test. We must deduce which symbol does not conform to
1115,all others. 
1116,DALEK 2: I will run computer scan. 
1117,DALEK: Key symbol.
1118,
1119, [City entrance hall]
1120,
1121, (The Doctor is moving his finger through the
1122,maze.) 
1123,"DOCTOR: Yes I think we've got it. I think this is it, Bellal. Yes,"
1124,that's it! 
1125,(The wall slides up to reveal a corridor. The pair go through and turn
1126,left past a metal grille wall. The wall closes again then the Daleks
1127,enter the city.) 
1128,DALEK: Locate next access point.
1129,
1130, [City corridor]
1131,
1132, (The Doctor and Bellal walk along to an apparent
1133,"dead end, then a panel slides up beside them revealing a new corridor"
1134,with a patterned floor half way along it. They enter and the panel
1135,closes again as they make their way to the patterned area.) 
1136,DOCTOR: Stop. Don't move! 
1137, Part Four
1138,
1139, [City corridor]
1140,
1141, BELLAL: What is it? 
1142,"DOCTOR: It's another test, I think. "
1143,"(Three concentric squares are divided into quarters and diagonally, and"
1144,the resulting sections alternately coloured red and white.) 
1145,"DOCTOR: The people who built this city, they didn't go in for"
1146,"ornamental floors, did they? "
1147,BELLAL: I don't understand. 
1148,"DOCTOR: No, neither do I. "
1149,(The Doctor takes out his sonic screwdriver and adjusts it to emit a
1150,"pulse, then passes it over the first row of the pattern. It beeps then"
1151,screeches then beeps again.) 
1152,"DOCTOR: Tell me, have you ever tried Venusian hopscotch? No, it's a"
1153,"silly question. You wouldn't have done. Anyway, now's your chance to"
1154,"learn. I want you to do exactly what I do, all right? "
1155,(The Doctor waves the screwdriver over the first line of pattern and
1156,"steps onto the first white. Then the smaller white diagonal to it, then"
1157,jumps with both feet into the small white triangles at the centre.
1158,"Meanwhile, the Daleks have completed the maze and enter the corridors."
1159,The Doctor is safely across the pattern and is directing Bellal.) 
1160,"DOCTOR: Now jump. Good. Now the next two white triangles. No, no, no."
1161,"Not the red, the white. To the right. That's it. And the other foot in"
1162,"the other white triangle Good, don't touch the red. Now, stay exactly"
1163,"where you are and give me your hand. Now, when I count three, you jump,"
1164,"and don't touch any of those squares. One, two, three, right, jump! "
1165,(The Doctor pulls Bellal safely over the rest of the pattern.) 
1166,"DOCTOR: Well done. That's rather a jolly game, don't you think? "
1167,"BELLAL: Well, was that really necessary, Doctor? "
1168,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, I think so. Let me show you something. "
1169,(The Doctor takes a coin out of a waistcoat pocket.) 
1170,"DOCTOR: Five piastas. Do I need five piastas? No, I don't think so."
1171,"Right then, just you watch this. "
1172,"(The Doctor tosses the coin onto a red section, and it gets zapped by"
1173,electricity until it goes BANG.) 
1174,"DOCTOR: Tilt. Right, let's go and see what other pleasures they have in"
1175,store for us. 
1176,"(A few moments or minutes later, the Daleks arrive.) "
1177,DALEK: Proceed with all caution. This territory will be classified as
1178,hostile. 
1179,DALEK 2: It is understood. 
1180,(The lead Dalek glides onto the pattern and gets zapped by multiple
1181,electric charges.) 
1182,DALEK: Alert! Alert! Excessive electrical charge received! 
1183,(The Dalek makes it to the other side. The second Dalek shoots at the
1184,"pattern, blasting holes in the floor. The electricity zaps the bullets"
1185,and it crosses unharmed.) 
1186,DALEK 2: Damage report? 
1187,DALEK: Non-conductive shielding burnt out. Sensors register receiving
1188,seven thousand volt electrical charge. 
1189,DALEK 2: Weapon evidently designed to destroy humanoid tissue. We will
1190,continue. Wait. Observe. 
1191,(The floor mends itself.) 
1192,DALEK 2: This evidence suggests that city is indestructible. Proceed.
1193,
1194, [City room]
1195,
1196, (The Doctor and Bellal enter an empty room.) 
1197,BELLAL: An empty room. 
1198,DOCTOR: Don't be too sure. 
1199,BELLAL: Moving inside this city is like being inside a living thing. 
1200,"DOCTOR: Yes, its bloodstream rather than its stomach. We're being moved"
1201,around like 
1202, [City Control room]
1203,
1204,(An Exxilon sits watching the wide screen.) 
1205,"DOCTOR : microbes, Bellal. And all the time getting closer"
1206,to the heart. 
1207, [Second Parrinium mine] 
1208, (Night time. Sarah makes her way to a rock where
1209,"Jill is sleeping in the open, avoiding the Dalek guard.) "
1210,SARAH: Psst. Jill. (nothing) Psst! Jill! 
1211,JILL: Sarah! 
1212,SARAH: Shush! Keep your voice down. 
1213,"(Jill sits up on the other side of the rock, and they whisper to each"
1214,other.) 
1215,JILL: What happened to you? Where's the Doctor? 
1216,SARAH: He's gone into the city. He's going to try and black out the
1217,beacon. 
1218,JILL: What's he want us to do? 
1219,SARAH: You must be ready for take off the moment the power comes back
1220,"on. Remember, it comes back on for the Daleks too. "
1221,"JILL: Yes, I know. "
1222,"SARAH: Right. Now, how much parrinium have you found? "
1223,"JILL: Well, there's more than "
1224,(Jill pretends to sleep as a Dalek passes by.) 
1225,JILL: More than enough. All those bags are full. 
1226,"SARAH: Good. Now, we have to find some way of getting it aboard your"
1227,ship. 
1228,JILL: With the Daleks standing guard over us? 
1229,SARAH: We've got to try somehow.
1230,
1231, [City Control room] 
1232, (The Doctor and Bellal examine the room they are
1233,in.) 
1234,DOCTOR : Nothing. Absolutely nothing. A room without a
1235,"clue, yet everything within this city has got a function. This room"
1236,must be here for a purpose. 
1237,BELLAL : Perhaps 
1238, [City room] 
1239, BELLAL: We have come as far as we are permitted. 
1240,"DOCTOR: No. No, we'll have to start all over again. Try in that corner,"
1241,will you? There's a good chap. 
1242,"(Bellal reaches as high as he can in the far corner, and a pulsing"
1243,"starts up, which reflects off his phosphorescent stripes.) "
1244,"DOCTOR: You know, I have a feeling "
1245,(Bellal is pointing the Dalek gun at the Doctor. The Doctor points his
1246,sonic screwdriver at him.) 
1247,"DOCTOR: Bellal, don't! Bellal? Bellal, don't. Now listen to me. Don't"
1248,fire that gun. Now remember why we're here. Remember why we came to
1249,this city. 
1250,"(The pulsing stops, and the Doctor switches off his screwdriver.) "
1251,"DOCTOR: Bellal, I'm your friend. Your friend. You know that. Don't fire"
1252,that gun. 
1253,(The Doctor pulls the gun from Bellal's hand and grabs him.) 
1254,"DOCTOR: Don't fire that gun! Now, what's happened? What is it? "
1255,BELLAL: There was a light that shone in my eyes. A blinding light. 
1256,(A section of wall slides up.) 
1257,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, whatever it is, we seem to have qualified for the"
1258,next test. Do you feel ready to go on? 
1259,"BELLAL: No, but we must. "
1260,"DOCTOR: Yes. Come on, old chap. "
1261,"(The Doctor and Bellal pass through the opening. It closes, then the"
1262,Daleks enter the room.)

1265,
1266," (A Dalek escorts Galloway and Hamilton, who are"
1267,carrying a bomb each.) 
1268,DALEK: You will climb to the summit and place the explosives on the
1269,beacon. 
1270,HAMILTON: And if we refuse? 
1271,DALEK: The girl we are holding as hostage will be exterminated. You
1272,will obey! You will be in range of my fire at all times. 
1273,"GALLOWAY: Well, let's get on with it. "
1274,"(Galloway helps Hamilton up to the first ledge, which is at head"
1275,height.)

1277, [Second Parrinium mine] 
1278,(The Dalek patrol passes again.) 
1279,JILL: Okay. 
1280,"SARAH: Jill, are there any empty parrinium bags? "
1281,"JILL: Yes, there are some right over by the workings. Why? "
1282,SARAH: I've got an idea. Sneak over and get them while I keep watch.
1283,Hurry! 
1284,(Jill goes to where the Exxilons are sitting around a camp fire. She
1285,"grabs some sacks, returns and throws them to Sarah before lying down"
1286,again as the Dalek passes.) 
1287,"SARAH: Now, the first thing we've got to do is get these filled."
1288,"Anything will do. If the Doctor does manage to restore power, we have"
1289,to be ready.
1290,
1291, [City corridor] 
1292, DOCTOR: We must be getting very close to the
1293,centre of the city by now. 
1294,BELLAL: We've come quite a way without any tests. Perhaps we're safe
1295,now? 
1296,DOCTOR: I shouldn't be too sure. Have you any idea why the city should
1297,be testing us in this way?
1298,
1299, [City Control room] 
1300, BELLAL : What do you mean? 
1301,"DOCTOR : Well, they could have destroyed us dozens of"
1302,times. Instead they gave us a chance to survive by using our
1303,intelligence. 
1304,BELLAL : And it has a purpose for this? 
1305,"DOCTOR : Oh, yes. By passing these tests we've proved that"
1306,we have an intelligence level that could be useful. We might have some
1307,knowledge or science that they could add to their databanks.
1308,
1309, [City test room] 
1310, (They walk into a darkened room without a door.
1311,There is a skeleton slumped in a corner.) 
1312,BELLAL: Now what? 
1313,"DOCTOR: Well, if I'm right, the ultimate test will be an assault on our"
1314,"sanity, so be ready for it. "
1315,(Coloured lights pulse through the room. Bellal is the first to clutch
1316,his head in pain.) 
1317,"DOCTOR: Bellal, fight it! Fight it, Bellal! "
1318,BELLAL: No! 
1319,DOCTOR: Fight it! It's an illusion! It's an illusion! You have no
1320,substance! No truth! You do not exist! You do not exist! 
1321,(The Doctor's works echo as the lights die down and the room returns to
1322,"normal. He is tired, and Bellal is whimpering in a corner.) "
1323,"DOCTOR: All right, old chap. It's all over now. It's all right. It's"
1324,"all over. There, that's it. What is it? "
1325,BELLAL: Look. 
1326,(A section of the opposite wall fades to reveal a way into the control
1327,room. The Exxilon in the chair can just be seen.)
1328,
1329, [City Control room] 
1330, (They stop as the Exxilon subsides gently into its
1331,cloak which in its turn becomes a pile of dust.) 
1332,DOCTOR: Our entrance must have created a current of air which broke the
1333,surface tension. 
1334,BELLAL: This is the brain of the city? 
1335,DOCTOR: The brain and the nervous system that we've go to destroy. 
1336,(The Doctor looks over panels on the other walls.) 
1337,"BELLAL: Doctor, the city defies all attempts to destroy it. We can't"
1338,end its power. 
1339,DOCTOR: I think I know a way. 
1340,(The Doctor pulls out a pair of circuit boards and starts work on them.
1341,Bellal wanders off. Two shallow alcoves light up red.) 
1342,BELLAL: Doctor! 
1343,DOCTOR: What is it? 
1344,"BELLAL: Doctor, come here! "
1345,DOCTOR: What is it? 
1346,BELLAL: Look! 
1347,(Two bipeds are starting to form in the red light.) 
1348,DOCTOR: We haven't got much time. 
1349,BELLAL: What is it? What's happening? 
1350,DOCTOR: The city is creating antibodies. They're trying to neutralise
1351,us. Now keep a very close eye on them. Let me know the moment they're
1352,complete.
1353,
1354, [Beacon base] 
1355, (Galloway and Hamilton have climbed the outside of
1356,the city. It is very windy up here.) 
1357,"HAMILTON: If we set the charges on this main support, that should be"
1358,close enough. 
1359,(He sets a timer and sticks the bomb onto the shaft.) 
1360,"HAMILTON: Right, set the detonator! "
1361,(Galloway hesitates.) 
1362,"HAMILTON: Oh, let me do it. "
1363,GALLOWAY: No. 
1364,"HAMILTON: Look, that Dalek down there can see every move we make. Now"
1365,give me the charge. 
1366,GALLOWAY: One charge is enough to damage the beacon. This one we keep.
1367,
1368, [Second Parrinium mine] 
1369, DALEK: Work to commence at dawn. Move! Move! 
1370,(The Exxilons grunt and obey. The Dalek goes over to where Jill is
1371,sleeping and prods the sacks she is using as a blanket.) 
1372,DALEK: Move! Move! 
1373,(It pushes the sacks aside.) 
1374,DALEK: Human female has escaped. I have failed! Female prisoner has
1375,escaped! I have failed! I have failed! Self destruct! I have failed!
1376,"Destruct! I have failed! Destruct! Failed! Failed! Failed! I, I, I, I,"
1377,I. 
1378,(The Dalek dies.)
1379,
1380, [City Control room]
1381,
1382, (The Doctor is still modifying the circuit boards
1383,as the figures in the red light drop their arms.) 
1384,BELLAL: Doctor! I think you should come now! 
1385,"DOCTOR: Yes, all right, I've nearly finished. "
1386,BELLAL: What are you doing? 
1387,DOCTOR: Psychological warfare. I'm trying to destroy the city's brain.
1388,Engineer what in human terms is called a nervous breakdown. 
1389,(The Doctor puts one circuit board back in its slot then starts work on
1390,the second. The two 'antibodies' come up behind them.) 
1391,BELLAL: Can it be done? 
1392,"DOCTOR: The computer is a machine of logic, Bellal, it cannot stand"
1393,paradoxes. 
1394,"(The antibodies grab them and take them across the room, past the large"
1395,monitor. The Daleks enter.) 
1396,DALEK 2: Halt. Stay where you are. Do not move. 
1397,"(Like space age versions of the Mummy, the two antibodies lurch towards"
1398,the Daleks.) 
1399,DALEK 2: Halt! Halt! 
1400,(The Doctor and Bellal make their escape from the control room as the
1401,Daleks open fire.) 
1402,DALEK 2: Halt or you will be exterminated! 
1403,DALEK 3: Assist! Assist! 
1404,"(The undead are not stopped by bullets, and they pound on the Daleks.) "
1405,DALEK 2: Exxilon mutants must be exterminated! Alert! Evacuate!
1406,Evacuate! Evacuate!
1407,
1408, [City corridor]
1409,
1410,(The city lights are flickering. Bellal and the
1411,Doctor come to the patterned floor.) 
1412,BELLAL: The floor! 
1413,DOCTOR: It should be safe now. Come on! 
1414,"(They run across, unaffected.)"
1415,
1416, [City Control room]
1417,
1418,(One Dalek has had its gun ripped from its body.) 
1419,DALEK 2: Alert! Alert! Evacuate! Evacuate! Evacuate! Retire to city
1420,entrance! Faster! Faster! I will cover you! I will cover you! Faster!
1421,Faster! Faster! Faster!
1422,
1423, [City corridor]
1424,
1425, (A panel is sliding up and down.) 
1426,BELLAL: Look! 
1427,DOCTOR: The controls are beginning to break down. it's working. Come
1428,on. 
1429,"(The Doctor and Bellal duck under, run to the entrance hall and"
1430,outside. The Daleks reach the first panel.)
1431,
1432, [Outside the City]
1433,
1434, BELLAL: I never thought we would escape. 
1435,"DOCTOR: The battle's not over yet. If I know the Daleks, they'll do"
1436,everything they can to stop that Earth mission ship from getting away.
1437,Come on!
1438,
1439, [Landing site]
1440,
1441,(Galloway has the second bomb hidden inside his
1442,jacket.) 
1443,DALEK: Report. 
1444,DALEK 2: Explosive device in position. Detonation will occur shortly
1445,and power circuits will be restored. 
1446,DALEK: Prepare for immediate take off. The prisoners will load the
1447,parrinium aboard our ship. 
1448,HAMILTON: Where is the girl you were holding? Where's Jill? 
1449,"DALEK: She escaped during darkness. Now our work is complete, she is of"
1450,no consequence. 
1451,DALEK 2: You will load the parrinium. Move! 
1452,(Galloway and Hamilton pick up a sack each and enter the Dalek ship.
1453,The Doctor and Bellal peer round a rock.) 
1454,DOCTOR: They're getting ready to leave. 
1455,BELLAL: And we are powerless to stop them. 
1456,"DOCTOR: Yes. I know the Daleks, and they'll cause the maximum havoc and"
1457,destruction before they go. 
1458,BELLAL: Why? 
1459,DOCTOR: It's their scorched planet policy. 
1460,(From behind another rock -) 
1461,SARAH: Doctor! 
1462,DOCTOR: Shush! How did it go? 
1463,"SARAH: Oh, we've just come from the Earth mission ship. It's all set"
1464,for take off the moment we get full power. 
1465,DOCTOR: Good. 
1466,JILL: But I can't handle the ship. We must free Peter and Lieutenant
1467,Galloway. 
1468,"DOCTOR: Well, that's not going to be so easy. Come over here and see"
1469,for yourself. Come on. Look.
1470,
1471, [Dalek spaceship]
1472,
1473, (The men put down their sacks and Hamilton checks
1474,his wrist watch.)
1475,"HAMILTON: This is it. Five seconds, four, three, two, one. "
1476,(The bomb at the base of the beacon goes KaBOOM! The beacon collapses
1477,and the lights come on in the space ship.) 
1478,DALEK: All power restored.
1479,
1480, [Landing site]
1481,
1482, JILL: The beacon! They've destroyed the beacon! 
1483,DALEK: Move! Move! 
1484,(They go over to where Hamilton is now standing outside the ship as
1485,other Daleks go back inside.) 
1486,"DOCTOR: Well, don't prolong the agony. It's obvious you mean to kill"
1487,us. Why don't you get on with it? 
1488,DALEK: It is not necessary. You will perish with the rest of the
1489,creatures. 
1490,"DOCTOR: Well, what had you in mind? "
1491,"DALEK: We have all the parrinium we need. With it, we can force the"
1492,"space powers to accede to our demands. If they do not, millions of"
1493,people on the outer planets will perish. 
1494,HAMILTON: Don't you think Earth will send another mission? Now that the
1495,"power barrier has been broken, we could have another ship here in less"
1496,than a month. 
1497,"DOCTOR: I imagine the Daleks have already taken that into account,"
1498,Peter. 
1499,"DALEK: Correct. When our ship is in space, we will fire a plague"
1500,missile on to the surface of this planet. The plague will destroy 
1501, [Dalek spaceship]
1502,
1503,(The Daleks backs in through the main hatch.) 
1504,DALEK: All life and make further landings here impossible! 
1505,(The hatch closes.)
1506,
1507, [Landing site]
1508,
1509," HAMILTON: Galloway, for God's sake, use the bomb! "
1510,"DOCTOR: Come on, get out of here quick or we'll be caught in the"
1511,"exhaust blast! Come on, out! Come on, quick. Move! "
1512,"(The party takes cover, and come out again when the ship has taken"
1513,off.) 
1514,"SARAH: Well, it's not much consolation, but at least they don't have"
1515,the parrinium. 
1516,DOCTOR: What do you mean? 
1517,"SARAH: Of course. Well, the Daleks have only got bags of sand. Jill and"
1518,I loaded to real parrinium aboard the Earth ship. 
1519,HAMILTON: I should never have trusted Galloway. He had one of the Dalek
1520,"bombs. Could have stopped them with it, damaged their ship. If I knew"
1521,where he was 
1522, [Dalek spaceship]
1523,
1524, DALEK 2: We are free of planet's atmosphere. 
1525,DALEK: Prepare to launch plague missile. 
1526,DALEK 2: I obey. 
1527,(Galloway is hiding behind the sacks of sand. He sets the bomb ticking
1528,then presses the red button. The spaceship goes KaBOOM!) 
1529, [Landing site] 
1530, HAMILTON: Galloway. 
1531,JILL: He must have hidden away when we put the bags on board. 
1532,"DOCTOR: Well, he did his duty, now you must do yours. Get that"
1533,parrinium to where it's needed. 
1534,"SARAH: Doctor, look! Look at the city! "
1535,(The now powerless City is giving in to the ravages of time and rapidly
1536,decaying into a pile of rubble.) 
1537,"DOCTOR: It's rather a pity, in a way. Now the universe is down to six"
1538,hundred and ninety nine wonders.
