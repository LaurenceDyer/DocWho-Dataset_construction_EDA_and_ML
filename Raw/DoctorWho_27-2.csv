20, (Carrying straight on from the last episode. The
21,Doctor and Rose are lit in green light from the time rotor.) 
22,"DOCTOR: Right then, Rose Tyler, you tell me. Where do you want to go?"
23,Backwards or forwards in time. It's your choice. What's it going to be?
24,
25,ROSE: Forwards. 
26,DOCTOR: How far? 
27,ROSE: One hundred years. 
28,(A few seconds of travel.) 
29,"DOCTOR: There you go. Step outside those doors, it's the twenty second"
30,century. 
31,ROSE: You're kidding. 
32,"DOCTOR: That's a bit boring, though. Do you want to go further? "
33,ROSE: Fine by me. 
34,"DOCTOR: Ten thousand years in the future. Step outside, it's the year"
35,"12005, the new Roman Empire. "
36,ROSE: You think you're so impressive. 
37,DOCTOR: I am so impressive. 
38,ROSE: You wish. 
39,"DOCTOR: Right then, you asked for it. I know exactly where to go. Hold"
40,on! 
41,(The Tardis zooms down a time vortex.) 
42,ROSE: Where are we? What's out there? 
43,[Gallery 15]
44,
45,(Rose goes down a flight of steps and a large
46,shutter in the wall descends to reveal an orbital view of the Earth.) 
47,"DOCTOR: You lot, you spend all your time thinking about dying, like"
48,you're going to get killed by eggs or beef or global warming or
49,"asteroids. But you never take time to imagine the impossible, that"
50,maybe you survive. This is the year five point five slash apple slash
51,"twenty six. Five billion years in your future, and this is the day "
52,(He looks at his wrist watch.) 
53,DOCTOR: Hold on. 
54,(The sun flares and turns red.) 
55,DOCTOR: This is the day the Sun expands. Welcome to the end of the
56,world.
57,
58,[Space]
59,
60,(A pair of small spaceships approach a large
61,cruciform space station hanging in Earth orbit.) 
62,COMPUTER: Shuttles five and six now docking. Guests are reminded that
63,"Platform One forbids the use of weapons, teleportation and religion."
64,Earth Death is scheduled for fifteen thirty nine 
65,[Platform One]
66,
67,COMPUTER: Followed by drinks in the Manchester
68,Suite. 
69,(The Doctor and Rose walk along a corridor.) 
70,"ROSE: So, when it says guests, does that mean people? "
71,DOCTOR: Depends what you mean by people. 
72,ROSE: I mean people. What do you mean? 
73,DOCTOR: Aliens. 
74,ROSE: What are they doing on board this spaceship? What's it all for? 
75,"DOCTOR: It's not really a spaceship, more like an observation deck. The"
76,great and the good are gathering to watch the planet burn. 
77,(The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver on a wall panel.) 
78,ROSE: What for? 
79,DOCTOR: Fun.
80,
81, [Observation gallery] 
82,(A large area with a few display cases and a view
83,of space to the front and above.) 
84,"DOCTOR: Mind you, when I said the great and the good, what I mean is,"
85,the rich. 
86,"ROSE: But, hold on. They did this once on Newsround Extra. The sun"
87,"expanding, that takes hundreds of years. "
88,"DOCTOR: Millions, but the planet's now property of the National Trust."
89,They've been keeping it preserved. See down there? Gravity satellites
90,holding back the sun. 
91,ROSE: The planet looks the same as ever. I thought the continents
92,shifted and things. 
93,"DOCTOR: They did, and the Trust shifted them back. That's a classic"
94,"Earth. But now the money's run out, nature takes over. "
95,ROSE: How long's it got? 
96,DOCTOR: About half an hour and then the planet gets roasted. 
97,"ROSE: Is that why we're here? I mean, is that what you do? Jump in at"
98,the last minute and save the Earth? 
99,DOCTOR: I'm not saving it. Time's up. 
100,ROSE: But what about the people? 
101,DOCTOR: It's empty. They're all gone. No one left. 
102,"ROSE: Just me, then. "
103,(A blue-skinned person with golden slit eyes strides towards them.) 
104,STEWARD: Who the hell are you? 
105,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's nice, thanks. "
106,STEWARD: But how did you get in? This is a maximum hospitality zone.
107,The guests have disembarked. They're on their way any second now. 
108,"DOCTOR: That's me. I'm a guest. Look, I've got an invitation. Look."
109,"There, you see? It's fine, you see? The Doctor plus one. I'm the"
110,"Doctor, this is Rose Tyler. She's my plus one. Is that all right? "
111,(The Doctor puts away the piece of apparently blank paper he was
112,showing to the steward.) 
113,"STEWARD: Well, obviously. Apologies, et cetera. If you're on board,"
114,we'd better start. Enjoy. 
115,(The Steward goes over to a lecturn.) 
116,DOCTOR: The paper's slightly psychic. It shows them whatever I want
117,them to see. Saves a lot of time. 
118,ROSE: He's blue. 
119,DOCTOR: Yeah. 
120,ROSE: Okay. 
121,STEWARD: We have in attendance the Doctor and Rose Tyler. Thank you.
122,All staff to their positions. 
123,(A lot of small people appear.) 
124,"STEWARD: Hurry, now, thank you. Quick as we can. Come along, come"
125,"along. And now, might I introduce the next honoured guest? Representing"
126,"the Forest of Cheam, we have trees, namely, Jabe, Lute and Coffa. "
127,(A bark-skinned woman enters with two larger male escorts.) 
128,STEWARD: There will be an exchange of gifts representing peace. If you
129,"could keep the room circulating, thank you. Next, from the solicitors"
130,"Jolco and Jolco, we have the Moxx of Balhoon. "
131,"(Another blue alien, this time mostly head and body, sitting on a"
132,transport pod.) 
133,"STEWARD: And next, from Financial Family Seven, we have the Adherents"
134,of the Repeated Meme. 
135,(A group of black-robed bipeds.) 
136,"STEWARD: The inventors of Hypo-slip Travel Systems, the brothers Hop"
137,Pyleen. Thank you. 
138,(Fur clad reptilians. The announcements of variations on the biped
139,theme continue.) 
140,STEWARD: Cal Spark Plug. Mister and Mrs Pacoo. The Ambassadors from the
141,City State of Binding Light. 
142,(The trees go up to the Doctor.) 
143,JABE: The Gift of Peace. I bring you a cutting of my Grandfather. 
144,(She gives the Doctor a rooted twig in a small pot.) 
145,"DOCTOR Thank you. Yes, gifts. Er, I give you in return air from my"
146,lungs. 
147,(He breathes gently on Jabe.) 
148,JABE: How intimate. 
149,DOCTOR: There's more where that came from. 
150,JABE: I bet there is. 
151,"STEWARD: From the Silver Devastation, the sponsor of the main event,"
152,please welcome the Face of Boe. 
153,(A large glass case barely makes it through the doorway. It contains a
154,giant humanoid head with straggly hair and squinting eyes.) 
155,DOCTOR: The Moxx of Balhoon. 
156,MOXX: My felicitations on this historical happenstance. I give you the
157,gift of bodily salivas. 
158,(Moxx's spit hits Rose in the face.) 
159,DOCTOR: Thank you very much. 
160,(The black-robed group glide up.) 
161,DOCTOR: Ah! The Adherents of the Repeated Meme. I bring you air from my
162,lungs. 
163,(A large metal hand holds out a ball.) 
164,ADHERENT: A gift of peace in all good faith. 
165,"STEWARD: And last but not least, our very special guest. Ladies and"
166,"gentlemen, and trees and multiforms, consider the Earth below. In"
167,"memory of this dying world, we call forth the last Human. The Lady"
168,Cassandra O'Brien Dot Delta Seventeen. 
169,(A face in a piece of thin skin stretched in a rectangular frame is
170,wheeled in by two men hidden in top-to-toe hospital whites. She is
171,"modelled on, and voiced by,  Zoe"
172,Wanamaker.) 
173,"CASSANDRA: Oh, now, don't stare. I know, I know it's shocking, isn't"
174,it? I've had my chin completely taken away and look at the difference.
175,Look how thin I am. Thin and dainty. I don't look a day over two
176,thousand. Moisturise me. Moisturise me. 
177,(One of her attendants uses a pump spray on the skin.) 
178,"CASSANDRA: Truly, I am the last Human. My father was a Texan, my mother"
179,was from the Arctic Desert. They were born on the Earth and were the
180,last to be buried in its soil. I have come to honour them and say
181,"goodbye. Oh, no tears, no tears. I'm sorry. But behold, I bring gifts."
182,"From Earth itself, the last remaining ostrich egg. Legend says it had a"
183,wingspan of fifty feet and blew fire from its nostrils. Or was that my
184,"third husband? Oh, no. Oh, don't laugh. I'll get laughter lines. And"
185,"here, another rarity. "
186,(Rose has walked round the back of Cassandra to see just how thin she
187,"is, and a 50's juke box is wheeled in.) "
188,"CASSANDRA: According to the archives, this was called an iPod. It"
189,stores classical music from humanity's greatest composers. Play on! 
190,"(One of the little attendants presses a button, a 45 is selected and"
191,the strains of Tainted Love by Soft Cell ring out.) 
192,STEWARD: Refreshments will now be served. Earth Death in thirty
193,minutes. 
194,"(Rose finally can't take all the aliens, and runs out. The Doctor goes"
195,"to follow her, but gets intercepted.) "
196,JABE: Doctor? 
197,"(Flash! from a device she is holding. A type of camera, presumably.) "
198,JABE: Thank you. 
199,ADHERENT: A gift of peace in all good faith. 
200,"STEWARD: No, you're very kind, but I'm just the Steward. "
201,ADHERENT: A gift of peace in all good faith. 
202,"STEWARD: Well, yes, thank you. Of course. "
203,"(The steward takes the proffered ball. Jabe consults her camera, which"
204,twitters like a bird.) 
205,JABE: Identify species. Please identify species. Now stop it. Identify
206,his race. Where's he from? It's impossible. 
207,(She hurries away. One of the Adherant's gifts has been placed on a
208,"shelf in a display stand. It opens, and a four-legged metal spider"
209,scurries away.)
210,
211,[Corridor]
212,
213,"(Rose has wandered off, and is looking at the"
214,growing Sun through a window when a young woman of the same race as the
215,Steward comes round the corner. She is wearing overalls and a baseball
216,cap.) 
217,ROSE: Sorry. Am I allowed to be in here? 
218,RAFFALO: You have to give us permission to talk. 
219,"ROSE: Er, you have permission. "
220,"RAFFALO: Thank you. And, no, you're not in the way. Guests are allowed"
221,anywhere. 
222,ROSE: Okay. 
223,(Raffalo goes to a wall panel and unlocks it.) 
224,ROSE: What's your name? 
225,RAFFALO: Raffalo. 
226,ROSE: Raffalo? 
227,"RAFFALO: Yes, miss. I won't be long, I've just got to carry out some"
228,maintenance. There's a tiny little glitch in the Face of Boe's suite.
229,There must be something blocking the system. He's not getting any hot
230,water. 
231,"ROSE: So, you're a plumber? "
232,"RAFFALO: That's right, miss. "
233,ROSE: They still have plumbers? 
234,"RAFFALO: I hope so, else I'm out of a job. "
235,ROSE: Where are you from? 
236,RAFFALO: Crespallion. 
237,"ROSE: That's a planet, is it? "
238,"RAFFALO: No. Crespallion's part of the Jaggit Brocade, affiliated to"
239,"the Scarlet Junction, Convex fifty six. And where are you from, miss?"
240,If you don't mind me asking. 
241,"ROSE: No, not at all. Er, I don't know. A long way away. I just sort of"
242,hitched a lift with this man. I didn't even think about it. I don't
243,"even know who he is. He's a complete stranger. Anyway, don't let me"
244,keep you. Good luck with it. 
245,"RAFFALO: Thank you, miss. And er, thank you for the permission. Not"
246,many people are that considerate. 
247,ROSE: Okay. See you later. 
248,(Rose leaves. Raffalo removes the wall panel and has a look inside.) 
249,"RAFFALO: Now then. Control, I'm at junction nineteen and I think the"
250,problem's coming from in here. I'll go inside and have a look. 
251,"(Before she can crawil into the conduit, there is a tapping sound of"
252,metal on metal.) 
253,RAFFALO: What's that? Is something in there? 
254,(A metal spider comes towards her.) 
255,"RAFFALO: Oh! Who are you, then? "
256,(It scuttles away.) 
257,"RAFFALO: Hold on! I if you're an upgrade I just need to register you,"
258,"that's all. Oh, come back. "
259,(She gets inside the conduit.) 
260,"RAFFALO: Ah, there you are. Now, I just need to register your ident."
261,"Oh, there's two of you. Got yourself a little mate. I think I'd better"
262,"report this to Control. How many of you are there? What are you? Oh,"
263,"no, no, no! "
264,(Raffalo gets dragged along the conduit.)
265,
266,[Steward's office]
267,
268,(The Steward puts his gift on a side table and sits
269,at his desk. The computer beeps and burbles at him.) 
270,"STEWARD: What's that? Well, how should I know? "
271,(He makes a broadcast.) 
272,STEWARD: Would the owner of the blue box in private gallery fifteen
273,please report to the Steward�s office immediately. Guests are reminded
274,that use of teleportation devices is strictly forbidden under Peace
275,Treaty five point four slash cup slash sixteen. Thank you. 
276,(The ball hatches another metal spider.)
277,
278,[Space]
279,
280,COMPUTER: Earth Death in twenty five minutes. 
281,[Gallery 15]
282,
283,(Rose is playing with the ball.) 
284,COMPUTER: Earth Death in twenty five minutes. 
285,"ROSE: Oh, thanks. "
286,(She puts the ball down and picks up the plant pot.) 
287,ROSE: Hello. My name's Rose. That's a sort of plant. We might be
288,related. I'm talking to a twig. 
289,(The ball hatches.)
290,
291,[Outside Gallery 15]
292,
293,(The little assistants are wheeling the Tardis
294,away.) 
295,"DOCTOR: Oi, now, careful with that. Park it properly. No scratches. "
296,(One of them hands the Doctor a ticket. It says on one side - Have A
297,Nice Day. A pair of spiders scuttle along the ceiling.)
298,
299,[Gallery 15]
300,
301,(The spider scans Rose's hand then scuttles away
302,when the Doctor calls out.) 
303,DOCTOR : Rose? Are you in there? 
304,(The Doctor enters.) 
305,"DOCTOR: Aye, aye. What do you think, then? "
306,"ROSE: Great. Yeah, fine. Once you get past the slightly psychic paper."
307,They're just so alien. The aliens are so alien. You look at 'em and
308,they're alien. 
309,DOCTOR: Good thing I didn't take you to the Deep South. 
310,ROSE: Where are you from? 
311,DOCTOR: All over the place. 
312,ROSE: They all speak English. 
313,"DOCTOR: No, you just hear English. It's a gift of the Tardis. The"
314,"telepathic field, gets inside your brain and translates. "
315,ROSE: It's inside my brain? 
316,"DOCTOR: Well, in a good way. "
317,ROSE: Your machine gets inside my head. It gets inside and it changes
318,"my mind, and you didn't even ask? "
319,DOCTOR: I didn't think about it like that. 
320,"ROSE: No, you were too busy thinking up cheap shots about the Deep"
321,"South. Who are you, then, Doctor? What are you called? What sort of"
322,alien are you? 
323,DOCTOR: I'm just the Doctor. 
324,ROSE: From what planet? 
325,"DOCTOR: Well, it's not as if you'll know where it is! "
326,ROSE: Where are you from? 
327,DOCTOR: What does it matter? 
328,ROSE: Tell me who you are! 
329,"DOCTOR: This is who I am, right here, right now, all right? All that"
330,"counts is here and now, and this is me. "
331,"ROSE: Yeah, and I'm here too because you brought me here, so just tell"
332,me. 
333,COMPUTER: Earth Death in twenty minutes. Earth Death in twenty minutes.
334,
335,"ROSE: All right. As my mate Shareen says, don't argue with the"
336,designated driver. 
337,(Rose takes out her mobile phone.) 
338,ROSE: Can't exactly call for a taxi. There's no signal. We're out of
339,range. Just a bit. 
340,DOCTOR: Tell you what. 
341,(He takes her phone apart.) 
342,DOCTOR: With a little bit of jiggery pokery. 
343,"ROSE: Is that a technical term, jiggery pokery? "
344,"DOCTOR: Yeah, I came first in jiggery pokery. What about you? "
345,"ROSE: No, I failed hullabaloo. "
346,DOCTOR: Oh. There you go. 
347,(Rose phones home.) 
348,JACKIE : Hello? 
349,ROSE: Mum? 
350,"JACKIE : Oh, what is it? "
351,[The Tyler flat]
352,
353,(Jackie is emptying the washing machine.) 
354,"JACKIE: What's wrong? What have I done now? Oh, this red top's falling"
355,to bits. 
356,[Gallery 15]
357,
358,JACKIE : You should get your money back. Go on.
359,
360,[The Tyler flat]
361,
362,"JACKIE: There must be something, you never phone in"
363,the middle of the day. 
364,[Gallery 15]
365,
366,JACKIE : What's so funny? 
367,"ROSE:: Nothing. You all right, though? "
368,[The Tyler flat]
369,
370,JACKIE: Yeah. Why wouldn't I be? 
371,[Gallery 15]
372,
373,ROSE: What day is it? 
374,[The Tyler flat]
375,
376,"JACKIE: Wednesday, all day. You got a hangover? "
377,[Gallery 15]
378,
379,"JACKIE: Oh, I tell you what. Put a quid in that"
380,Lottery syndicate. I'll pay you back later. 
381,"ROSE: Yeah, er, I was just calling 'cos "
382,[The Tyler flat]
383,
384,ROSE : I might be late home. 
385,JACKIE: Is there something wrong? 
386,[Gallery 15]
387,
388,ROSE: No. I'm fine. Top of the world. 
389,(Jackie rings off.) 
390,"DOCTOR: Think that's amazing, you want to see the bill. "
391,"ROSE: That was five billion years ago. So, she's dead now. Five billion"
392,"years later, my mum's dead. "
393,"DOCTOR: Bundle of laughs, you are. "
394,(The space station shakes.) 
395,DOCTOR: That's not supposed to happen.
396,
397,[Steward's office]
398,
399,"STEWARD: Well, what was it? I'm just getting green"
400,lights at this end. 
401,(He makes a calm broadcast.) 
402,STEWARD: Honoured guests may be reassured that gravity pockets may
403,"cause slight turbulence, thanking you. "
404,(He berates Control.) 
405,STEWARD: The whole place shook! I felt it. I've hosted all sorts of
406,"events on Platforms One, Three, Six and Fifteen and I've never felt the"
407,"slightest tremor. I warn you, if this lot decide to sue. I'm going to"
408,scan the infrastructure. 
409,"(He does so, then hears a scuttling sound.) "
410,"STEWARD: What's that? Control, I don't want to worry you, but I'm"
411,"picking up readings. I have no idea. Well, they're small. The scan says"
412,they're metal. I don't know what they look like! 
413,(Then he sees one on the desk.) 
414,STEWARD: Although I imagine they might look rather like that. You're
415,not on the guest list. How did you get on board? 
416,(The spider pushes a button on his desk keyboard.) 
417,STEWARD: No. 
418,COMPUTER: Sun filter deactivated. 
419,STEWARD: No! 
420,COMPUTER: Sun filter descending. 
421,(The room starts to fill with white light from the ceiling downwards as
422,the filter on the window lowers.) 
423,"STEWARD: No! Sun filter, up! No, no, no! "
424,COMPUTER: External temperature four thousand degrees. 
425,"STEWARD: Control, respond! Sun filter up! Argh! "
426,(The spider escapes through a small vent into the corridor.)
427,
428,[Observation gallery]
429,
430,"MOXX: Indubitably, this is the Bad Wolf scenario. I"
431,find the inherent laxity of the on-going multiverse 
432,(The Doctor and Rose enter.) 
433,DOCTOR: That wasn't a gravity pocket. I know gravity pockets and they
434,"don't feel like that. What do you think, Jabe? Listened to the engines."
435,They've pitched up about thirty Hertz. That dodgy or what? 
436,JABE: It's the sound of metal. It doesn't make any sense to me. 
437,DOCTOR: Where's the engine room? 
438,"JABE: I don't know, but the maintenance duct is just behind our guest"
439,"suite, I could show you and your wife. "
440,DOCTOR: She's not my wife. 
441,JABE: Partner? 
442,DOCTOR: No. 
443,JABE: Concubine? 
444,DOCTOR: Nope. 
445,JABE: Prostitute? 
446,"ROSE: Whatever I am, it must be invisible. Do you mind? Tell you what,"
447,you two go and pollinate. I'm going to catch up with family. Quick word
448,with Michael Jackson. 
449,(Rose goes to talk to Cassandra.) 
450,DOCTOR: Don't start a fight. 
451,(He offers Jabe his arm.) 
452,DOCTOR: I'm all yours. 
453,ROSE: And I want you home by midnight. 
454,COMPUTER: Earth Death in fifteen minutes. Earth Death in fifteen
455,minutes.
456,
457,[Maintenance duct]
458,
459,(A multitude of spiders scuttle out of sight behind
460,the swags of wiring and piping.) 
461,DOCTOR: Who's in charge of Platform One? Is there a Captain or what? 
462,JABE: There's just the Steward and the staff. All the rest is
463,controlled by the metal mind. 
464,DOCTOR: You mean the computer? But who controls that? 
465,JABE: The Corporation. They move Platform One from one artistic event
466,to another. 
467,DOCTOR: But there's no one from the Corporation on board. 
468,JABE: They're not needed. This facility is purely automatic. It's the
469,height of the Alpha class. Nothing can go wrong. 
470,DOCTOR: Unsinkable? 
471,JABE: If you like. The nautical metaphor is appropriate. 
472,DOCTOR: You're telling me. I was on board another ship once. They said
473,that was unsinkable. I ended up clinging to an iceberg. It wasn't half
474,cold.
475,"So, what you're saying is, if we get in trouble there's no one to help"
476,us out? 
477,JABE: I'm afraid not. 
478,DOCTOR: Fantastic. 
479,JABE: I don't understand. In what way is that fantastic?

483,"CASSANDRA: Soon, the sun will blossom into a red"
484,"giant, and my home will die. That's where I used to live, when I was a"
485,"little boy, down there. Mummy and Daddy had a little house built into"
486,the side of the Los Angeles Crevice. I'd have such fun. 
487,"ROSE: What happened to everyone else? The human race, where did it go? "
488,CASSANDRA: They say mankind has touched every star in the sky. 
489,"ROSE: So, you're not the last human. "
490,CASSANDRA: I am the last pure human. The others mingled. 
491,"CASSANDRA: Oh, they call themselves New humans and Proto-humans and"
492,"Digi-humans, even 'Humanish, but you know what I call them? Mongrels. "
493,ROSE: Right. And you stayed behind. 
494,CASSANDRA: I kept myself pure. 
495,ROSE: How many operations have you had? 
496,"CASSANDRA: Seven hundred and eight. Next week, it's seven hundred and"
497,nine. I'm having my blood bleached. Is that why you wanted a word? You
498,"could be flatter, Rose. You've got a little bit of a chin poking out. "
499,ROSE: I'd rather die. 
500,"CASSANDRA: Honestly, it doesn't hurt. "
501,"ROSE: No, I mean it. I would rather die. It's better to die than live"
502,"like you, a bitchy trampoline. "
503,"CASSANDRA: Oh, well. What do you know. "
504,"ROSE: I was born on that planet, and so was my mum, and so was my dad,"
505,"and that makes me officially the last human being in this room, 'cos"
506,you're not human. You've had it all nipped and tucked and flattened
507,till there's nothing left. Anything human got chucked in the bin.

514,doing in a place like this? 
515,JABE: Respect for the Earth. 
516,"DOCTOR: Oh, come on. Everyone on this platform's worth zillions. "
517,"JABE: Well, perhaps it's a case of having to be seen at the right"
518,occasions. 
519,DOCTOR: In case your share prices drop? I know you lot. You've got
520,"massive forests everywhere, roots everywhere, and there's always money"
521,in land. 
522,"JABE: All the same, we respect the Earth as family. So many species"
523,evolved from that planet. Mankind is only one. I'm another. My
524,"ancestors were transplanted from the planet down below, and I'm a"
525,direct descendant of the tropical rainforest.

527,(He scans a door panel marked Welcome to Platform One. Guide of
528,Platform One Do You Need Assistance. A keypad labelled

530,"JABE: And what about your ancestry, Doctor? Perhaps you could tell a"
531,story or two. Perhaps a man only enjoys trouble when there's nothing
532,else left. I scanned you earlier. The metal machine had trouble
533,identifying your species. It refused to admit your existence. And even
534,"when it named you, I wouldn't believe it. But it was right. I know"
535,"where you're from. Forgive me for intruding, but it's remarkable that"
536,you even exist. I just wanted to say how sorry I am.

548,of nice and old fashioned. Bet they call it retro.

696,that? 
697,CASSANDRA: I'd hoped to manufacture a hostage situation with myself as
