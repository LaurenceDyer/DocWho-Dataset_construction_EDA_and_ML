24,GIRL: Hello. 
25,DOCTOR: Hello. 
26,GIRL: Why are you sitting on a swing? 
27,DOCTOR: Why shouldn't I? 
28,GIRL: Because you're old. 
29,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's true. That is very true. "
30,GIRL: My mum says I shouldn't talk to strange men. 
31,"DOCTOR: Ah, you mum's right. "
32,GIRL: Are you strange? 
33,"DOCTOR: Oh, dear. I'm way past strange. I think I'm probably"
34,incredible. 
35,GIRL: Are you lonely? 
36,DOCTOR: Why would I be lonely? 
37,GIRL: Because you're sad. Have you lost something? 
38,DOCTOR: No. 
39,"GIRL: When I lose something, I go to a quiet place and I close my eyes,"
40,and then I can remember where I put it. 
41,DOCTOR: Good plan. 
42,"GIRL: I'm always losing things. I lost my best pencil, my schoolbag,"
43,"and my gran, and my mojo. "
44,DOCTOR: Your mojo? 
45,"GIRL: I got it back, though. "
46,"DOCTOR: Hey, that's good. "
47,GIRL: What did you lose? 
48,"DOCTOR: My friend. I met her twice before and I lost her both times,"
49,and now I don't think I'll ever find her again. 
50,GIRL: Have you been looking? 
51,"DOCTOR: Yeah, everywhere. "
52,GIRL: That's sad. 
53,"DOCTOR: It is a bit. Hey, is that your mum? "
54,"GIRL: Yeah, I'd better go and see if she's all right. "
55,"DOCTOR: Yeah, I think you better had. "
56,GIRL: How are you going to find her? 
57,"DOCTOR: Well, the first two times I met her, I just sort of bumped into"
58,"her, so I thought maybe if I just wandered about a bit, I might bump"
59,"into her again. You know, like destiny, sort of. "
60,GIRL: That's rubbish. 
61,"DOCTOR: Yeah, I think it probably is. Hey, maybe I could find a quiet"
62,room and have a good think about it instead. 
63,GIRL: That would be better. Goodbye. 
64,DOCTOR: Goodbye. 
65,"GIRL: Mister, I hope you find her again. "
66,DOCTOR: So do I. 
67,MUM: Who was that? 
68,GIRL: I was talking to a sad man. 
69,"MUM: Look, Clara Oswald, what have I told you about talking to strange"
70,men?
71,
72,(Over images of people connecting to a red wifi
73,"linking the whole planet, via desktops, laptops, phones,"
74,etc. is a man on a staticky screen.) 
75,NABILE: Danger. This is a warning. A warning to the whole world. You're
76,looking for wifi. Sometimes you see something. 
77,(He holds up a card with seven strange symbols.) 
78,NABILE: A bit like this. Don't click it. Do not click it. Once you've
79,"clicked it, they're in your computer. "
80,(A whole slew of weird symbols in the available connections list.) 
81,"NABILE: They can see you. And they can see you, they might choose you."
82,"And if they do, you die. For twenty four hours, you're dead. For a"
83,while. People's souls are being uploaded to the internet. And some
84,"people get stuck. Their minds, their souls, in the wifi. Like echoes,"
85,"like ghosts. Sometimes you can hear their screams on the radio, on the"
86,"telly, on the net. This is real. This is not a hoax. "
87,MAN 2 [on screen]: I don't know where I am. 
88,NABILE: Or a joke. 
89,(A Japanese woman on a laptop screen.) 
90,NABILE: Or a story. 
91,MAN 3 [on screen]: I don't know where I am. 
92,"NABILE: This is real, and I know that, because I don't know where I am."
93,"Please, please, if you can hear me, if you can hear me, I don't know"
94,where I am. 
95,(We pull out to a display of lots of screens of people saying they
96,don't know where they are.)

100,(A monk hammers on the doors of a monastery.) 
101,MONK: Wake the Abbott. The bells of Saint John are ringing.
102,
103,[Courtyard]
104,
105,ABBOTT: We must go to him.
106,
107,[Tunnel]
108,
109,"MONK: They call him the mad monk, don't they. "
110,ABBOTT: They shouldn't. He's definitely not a monk.
111,
112,[Room]
113,
114,"ABBOTT: Ahem. I'm sorry to intrude, but the bells"
115,of Saint John are ringing. 
116,DOCTOR: I'm going to need a horse. 
117,(There is a portrait on an easel.) 
118,MONK: Is that her? 
119,"ABBOTT: The woman twice dead, and her final message. He was drawn to"
120,this place of peace and solitude that he might divine her meaning. If
121,"he truly is mad, then this is his madness. "
122,"(The message on the portrait is, of course, Run you clever boy and"
123,remember.)
124,
125,[Maitland home]
126,
127,(The present day version of the portrait is on her
128,phone.) 
129,"CLARA: Angie? Is the internet working? Trying to phone the helpline,"
130,they won't answer. 
131,ANGIE: It's working for me. 
132,CLARA: Can I use it when you're finished? 
133,"ANGIE: More than one person can use the internet at a time, Clara. "
134,CLARA: You done your homework? 
135,"ANGIE: Shut up, you're not my mum. "
136,"CLARA: And I'm not trying to be, okay? "
137,"(The father enters with his son, who hands him the car keys.) "
138,GEORGE: Right. Yes. Angie's probably fine on her own. You can probably
139,have the night off. 
140,CLARA: I'm okay. I'll be upstairs when I figure out my computer. 
141,"GEORGE: Anyway, the adverts are in, so hopefully we'll find someone. "
142,CLARA: I'm here as long as you need me. 
143,"GEORGE: Good. Right, come along, Artie. Time to go. "
144,(Clara takes the book Artie is holding. Summer Falls by Amelia
145,Williams. The
146,"late Mrs Amy Williams of New York, perchance?) "
147,CLARA: What chapter are you on? 
148,ARTIE: Ten. 
149,CLARA: Eleven is the best. You'll cry your eyes out. 
150,FATHER : Artie! 
151,(Artie leaves. Clara returns to her phone.) 
152,"CLARA: Oh, come on! Just answer. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. "
153,"(She goes upstairs to her room, which is converted attic space. Clara"
154,stabs at her laptop to get the available wifi list up. Just two -
155,Maitland_Family and the weird symbols.) 
156,[Cavern]
157,
158,(A telephone is ringing in the woods. The Doctor's
159,escorts have brought him to a stone built entrance to an underground
160,cavern. The Tardis is here.) 
161,DOCTOR: That is not supposed to happen. 
162,(He opens the little door next to the St John Ambulance symbol and
163,answers the phone.) 
164,DOCTOR: Hello?
165,
166,[Clara's room]
167,
168,"CLARA: Ah, hello. I can't find the internet."
169,
170,[Cavern]
171,
172,DOCTOR: Sorry? 
173,"CLARA : It's gone, the internet."
174,
175,[Clara's room]
176,
177,CLARA: Can't find it anywhere. Where is it?
178,
179,[Cavern]
180,
181,DOCTOR: The internet? 
182,"CLARA : Yes, the internet."
183,
184,[Clara's room]
185,
186,CLARA: Why don't I have the internet?
187,
188,[Cavern]
189,
190,DOCTOR: It's twelve oh seven.
191,
192,[Clara's room]
193,
194,CLARA: I've got half past three. Am I phoning a
195,different time zone?
196,
197,[Cavern]
198,
199,"DOCTOR: Yeah, you really sort of are. "
200,CLARA : Will it show up on the bill? 
201,"DOCTOR: Oh, I dread to think. Listen, where did you get this number? "
202,CLARA : The woman in the shop wrote it down.
203,
204,[Clara's room]
205,
206,"CLARA: It's a help line, isn't it? She said it's"
207,the best help line out there. 
208,[Cavern]
209,
210,"CLARA : In the universe, she said. "
211,DOCTOR: What woman? Who was she? 
212,CLARA : I don't know. The woman in the shop. So
213,
214,[Clara's room]
215,
216,CLARA: Why isn't there internet? Shouldn't it sort
217,of 
218,[Cavern]
219,
220,CLARA : Be there? 
221,"DOCTOR: Look, listen, I'm not actually, it isn't. You have clicked on"
222,"the wifi button, yeah?"
223,
224,[Clara's room]
225,
226,CLARA: Hang on. Wifi. 
227,"DOCTOR : Click on the wifi, you'll see a list of names. You see one"
228,you recognise. 
229,CLARA: It's asking me for a password. 
230,ANGIE: Is it okay if I go and see Nina? You can call her mum. 
231,CLARA: Sure. What's the password for the internet? 
232,ANGIE: R Y C B A R 1 2 3. 
233,CLARA: How am I supposed to remember that?
234,
235,[Cavern]
236,
237,MONK: Is it an evil spirit? 
238,DOCTOR: A woman. 
239,(The monk crosses himself.) 
240,CLARA : Hang on.
241,
242,[Clara's room]
243,
244,CLARA: A mo. Run you clever boy and remember one
245,two three
246,
247,[Cavern]
248,
249,(The Doctor does remember.) 
250,DOCTOR: What did you say?
251,
252,[Clara's room]
253,
254,CLARA: Don't shout. Now you've made me type it
255,wrong. It's thrown me out again. What do I do? How do I get back in? 
256,"(Clara clicks on the symbols wifi, and lots more pop up. The local red"
257,line whizzes up the road.) 
258,[Somewhere]
259,
260,CLARA [on screen]: It's just a thing to remember
261,"the password, run you clever boy and remember. Hang on. "
262,(Clara leaves her screen amongst the masses of frantic people.)
263,
264,[Maitland home]
265,
266,"CLARA: Hello? Yes, I hear you. "
267,(Someone is frantically hammering on the door and ringing the bell.) 
268,CLARA: Yep. Ah ha. 
269,(She opens the door to the Doctor.) 
270,CLARA: Hello. 
271,DOCTOR: Clara. Clara Oswald. 
272,CLARA: Hello. 
273,DOCTOR: Clara Oswin Oswald. 
274,CLARA: Just Clara Oswald. What was that middle one? 
275,DOCTOR: Do you remember me? 
276,CLARA: No. Should I? Who are you? 
277,DOCTOR: The Doctor. No? The Doctor? 
278,CLARA: Doctor who? 
279,"DOCTOR: No, just the Doctor. Actually, sorry, could you start all that"
280,again? 
281,CLARA: Could I what? 
282,DOCTOR: Could you just ask me that question again? 
283,CLARA: Doctor who? 
284,"DOCTOR: Okay, just once more. "
285,CLARA: Doctor who? 
286,"DOCTOR: Ooo, yeah. Ooo. Do you know, I never realised how much I enjoy"
287,hearing that said out loud. Thank you. 
288,CLARA: Okay. 
289,(And shuts the door on him.) 
290,"DOCTOR: Hey, no, Clara, please. Clara, I need to talk to you. Listen."
291,Please.
292,
293,[Office]
294,
295,ALEXEI: Clara Oswald. We've got a positive lock on
296,"her, but I think she's borderline. Very clever but no computer skills. "
297,(The lady in charge gives her decision.) 
298,KIZLET: Upload her anyway. Splice her a computer skills package. 
299,ALEXEI: I'll activate a spoonhead. 
300,(A Cardassian?) 
301,"KIZLET: Alexei, we call them servers, not spoonheads. "
302,ALEXEI: Sorry. Excuse me. 
303,"KIZLET: I'm ever so fond of Alexei, but my conscience says we should"
304,probably kill him. 
305,MAHLER: I'll inform HR. 
306,"KIZLET: Actually, he's about to go on holiday. Kill him when he gets"
307,back. Let's not be unreasonable. 
308,(They enter her office via a short staircase.)
309,
310,[Miss Kizlet's office]
311,
312,"(They are very high up, looking straight out"
313,towards the Gherkin in the City of London.) 
314,KIZLET: Didn't you want to speak to me? 
315,MAHLER: We're uploading too many people too quickly. We're going to get
316,noticed. 
317,"KIZLET: If your conscience is bothering you, think of it like this."
318,We're preserving living minds in
319,"permanent form in the data cloud. It's like immortality, only fatal. "
320,(She scrolls through photographs on her iPad until she gets to his.
321,"There are four sliders under it, conscience, paranoia, obedience and"
322,IQ.) 
323,MAHLER: My conscience is fine. 
324,KIZLET: Good. Because our client has his needs. 
325,(She lowers his conscience slider to zero and ups the paranoia.) 
326,MAHLER: Did you just hack me? 
327,KIZLET: Because you changed your mind? 
328,MAHLER: I hope I did. 
329,"(She drops his paranoia back down again as he leaves, then back up.)"
330,
331,[Maitland home]
332,
333,"DOCTOR: Please, I just need to speak to you. "
334,(Clara turns on the door intercom.) 
335,CLARA: Why are you still here? Why are you here at all? 
336,"DOCTOR [on screen]: Oi, you phoned me. You were looking for the"
337,internet. 
338,CLARA: That was you? 
339,[Outside the Maitland home]
340,
341,DOCTOR: Of course it was me. 
342,CLARA : How did you get here so fast?
343,
344,[Maitland home]
345,
346,DOCTOR [on screen]: I just happened to be in the
347,"neighbourhood, on my mobile phone. "
348,"CLARA: When you say mobile phone, why do you point at that blue box? "
349,DOCTOR [on screen]: Because it's a surprisingly accurate description. 
350,"CLARA: Okay, we're finished now. "
351,"DOCTOR : Oi, no, don't. "
352,(There is the creak of a floorboard then a door closing upstairs.) 
353,"CLARA: Angie? Angie, you upstairs? Angie, you still here? "
354,(A young girl walks down the stairs. The young girl from the cover of
355,the book.) 
356,CLARA: Hello. 
357,GIRL: Hello. 
358,CLARA: Are you a friend of Angie's? 
359,GIRL: I'm a friend of Angie's. 
360,CLARA: What were you doing upstairs? 
361,GIRL: I was upstairs. 
362,"CLARA: I know you, don't I? "
363,"GIRL: You know me, don't you. "
364,"(Clara remembers, then the girl starts to turn her head. It goes around"
365,180 degrees to reveal a concave metallic back to her skull. A
366,spoonhead?)
367,
368,[Tardis]
369,
370,DOCTOR: Right. Don't be a monk. Monks are not cool.
371,
372,(He goes to the cabinets below the time rotor and starts throwing
373,"garments around. He finds his fez, then changes into a white shirt and"
374,knee length coat. The bow tie is in a wooden box.)
375,
376,[Outside the Maitland home]
377,
378,DOCTOR: Ah ha! Clara! Clara? 
379,CLARA : Hello? 
380,"DOCTOR: Ah, see? Look, it's me. De-monked. Sensible clothes. Can I come"
381,in now? 
382,CLARA : I don't understand. 
383,DOCTOR: You just open the door. 
384,CLARA : I don't know.
385,
386,[Maitland home]
387,
388,DOCTOR: Of course you can.
389,
390,[Outside the Maitland home]
391,
392,CLARA : Where I am. I don't know where I am.
393,Where am I? Please tell me where I am. I don't know where I am. 
394,(The Doctor sonicks his way in.)
395,
396,[Maitland home]
397,
398,CLARA : I don't know where I am. I don't know
399,where I am! 
400,(Clara is lying unconscious on the floor.) 
401,DOCTOR: Clara? Clara? 
402,CLARA : I don't know where I am. I don't know where I am. I don't
403,understand. I don't know where I am! I don't understand. I don't know
404,where I am. 
405,(Clara is visible in the spoonhead's dish.) 
406,CLARA : Where am I? I don't know where I am.

415,"(Under the sonic onslaught, the girl turns into a"
416,metal robot.) 
417,DOCTOR: Walking base station. Walking wifi base station. Hoovering up
418,data. Hoovering up people.

420,[Clara's room]

432,ALEXEI: Looks like someone is trying to reverse an
433,upload. 
434,KIZLET: Is that possible? 
435,"MAHLER: The upload isn't fully integrated yet. In theory, yes. "
436,(The upload indicator reverses.) 
437,"ALEXEI: Oh, my god. "
438,(He starts typing.) 
439,[Maitland home]

451,[Maitland home]
452,
453,(A stream of energy from the mobile base station
454,goes into Clara's head and she wakes up.)

463,(He brings it up on the big wall screen. UNDER MY PROTECTION - The
464,Doctor.) 
465,MAHLER: I assume he's talking about the girl. 
466,KIZLET: Get out. I have to speak to the client.

471,
472,"(While Clara sleeps, the Doctor puts a glass and"
473,"jug of water on her bedside table, then some flowers in a"
474,"mug. No water for them. And finally, an entire packet of jammy dodgers."
475,"He takes a bite out of one of them, and savours it. Then he spots an"
476,old book - 101 Places To See - which she has had since she was 9 years
477,old. She is now at least 24. Inside the first page is a pressed maple
478,"leaf. He tastes the leaf, then puts it and the book back and leave the"
479,"room. Clara wakes, sees the half eaten biscuit and sits up. She looks"
480,"out of the little attic window, down to where the Doctor has set up a"
481,"chair and table outside the Tardis, and is using her laptop. He has"
482,what is either a gizmo or partly disassembled spoonhead in front of
483,him.) 
484,CLARA: Hello? 
485,DOCTOR: Hello! Are you all right? 
486,CLARA: I'm in bed. 
487,DOCTOR: Yes. 
488,CLARA: Don't remember going. 
489,DOCTOR: No. 
490,CLARA: What did I miss? 
491,"DOCTOR: Oh, quite a lot, actually. Angie called. She's going to stay"
492,over at Nina's. Apparently that's all completely fine and you shouldn't
493,"worry like you always do. For god's sake get off her back. Also, your"
494,"dad phoned, mainly about the government. He seems very cross with them,"
495,I've got several pages on that. I said I'd look into it. I fixed that
496,"rattling noise in the washing machine, indexed the kitchen cupboards,"
497,optimised photosynthesis in the main flower bed and assembled a
498,quadricycle. 
499,CLARA: Assembled a what? 
500,DOCTOR: I found a disassembled quadricycle in the garage. 
501,CLARA: I don't think you did. 
502,DOCTOR: I invented the quadricycle. Ha! 
503,CLARA: What happened to me? 
504,DOCTOR: Don't you remember? 
505,"CLARA: I was scared, really scared. Didn't know where I was. "
506,DOCTOR: Do you know now? 
507,CLARA: Yes. 
508,"DOCTOR: Well then, you should go to sleep. Because you're safe now, I"
509,"promise. Goodnight, Clara. "
510,CLARA: Are you guarding me? 
511,"DOCTOR: Well, yes. Yes, I am. "
512,CLARA: Are you seriously going to sit down there all night? 
513,DOCTOR: I promise I won't budge from this spot.

535,CLARA: Are you going to explain what happened to me? 
536,DOCTOR: There's something in the wifi. 
537,CLARA: Okay. 
538,DOCTOR: This whole world is swimming in wifi. We're living in a wifi
539,soup. Suppose something got inside it. Suppose there was something
540,"living in the wifi, harvesting human minds. Extracting them. Imagine"
541,that. Human souls trapped like flies in the world-wide web. Stuck
542,"forever, crying out for help. "
543,CLARA: Isn't that basically Twitter? 
544,(The Doctor clicks on her wifi list. All the sets of symbols pop up.) 
545,CLARA: What's that face for? 
546,"DOCTOR: A computer can hack another computer. A living, sentient"
547,"computer, maybe that could hack people. Edit them. Re-write them. "
548,CLARA: Why would you say that? 
549,"DOCTOR: Because a few hours ago you knew nothing about the internet,"
550,and you just made a joke about Twitter. 
551,"CLARA: Oh. Oh, that's weird. I know all about computers now in my head."
552,Where did all that come from? 
553,"DOCTOR: You were uploaded for a while. Wherever you were, you brought"
554,"something extra back, which I very much doubt you'll be allowed to"

562,"CLARA: I bet I will. What is that box, anyway? Why have you got a box?"
563,Is it like a snogging booth?

571,"DOCTOR: No, people are switching on the lights. The wifi is switching"
572,on the people.

1099,CLARA: I keep the book because I'm still going. 
1100,DOCTOR: But you don't run out on the people you care about. Wish I was

1103,"say? Anywhere. All of time and space, right outside those doors. "
1104,CLARA: Does this work? 
1105,DOCTOR: Eh? 
1106,CLARA: Is this actually what you do? Do you just crook your finger and
1107,people just jump in your snog box and fly away? 
1108,DOCTOR: It is not a snog box. 
1109,CLARA: I'll be the judge of that. 
1110,DOCTOR: Starting when?
