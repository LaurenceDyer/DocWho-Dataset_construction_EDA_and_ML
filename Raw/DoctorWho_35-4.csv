23,"(The Doctor is giving us, the viewers, a lecture.) "
24,"DOCTOR: So there's this man. He has a time machine. Up and down history he goes, zip zip zip zip zip, getting into scrapes. "
25,(He goes up to the gallery.)
26,DOCTOR: Another thing he has is a passion for the works of Ludwig van Beethoven. 
27,(Holds up a vinyl LP of Beethoven's 5th.)
28,"DOCTOR: And one day he thinks, what's the point of having a time machine "
29,if you don't get to meet your heroes? So off he goes to eighteenth century Germany. But he can't find Beethoven anywhere.
30," No one's heard of him, not even his family have any idea who the time traveller is talking about. "
31,(He swaps the LP for a plaster bust of Ludwig and walks down the stairs.)
32,"DOCTOR: Beethoven literally doesn't exist. This didn't happen, by the way. I've met Beethoven. Nice chap. Very intense. "
33,"Loved an arm-wrestle. No, this is called the Bootstrap Paradox. Google it. The time traveller panics. "
34,(The bust is put down on a pile of sheet music.)
35,DOCTOR: He can't bear the thought of a world 
36,without the music of Beethoven. Luckily he'd brought all of his Beethoven sheet music for Ludwig to sign. 
37,"So he copies out all the concertos, and the symphonies and he gets them published. He becomes Beethoven. And history continues with barely a feather ruffled. "
38,But my question is this. Who put those notes and phrases together? Who really composed Beethoven's Fifth?
39,(The
40,Doctor has finished plugging in his electric guitar and plays - da da
41,"da dah! da da da dah! And now, back to our drama.) "
42,
43,[Railway station]
44,
45,(This is a 
46,"completely fake town, with Russian signs and cardboard"
47,cut-out people for target practice. There is no evidence of recent MOD 
48,"usage. The Tardis has landed on the fake railway platform, I think.)"
49,DOCTOR: Where's Bennett? We need to get going. 
50,"O'DONNELL: Oh, he's still throwing up. One small step for man, one"
51,giant bleaurgh. 
52,"DOCTOR: Oh, time travel does that sometimes. "
53,O'DONNELL: Somehow I doubt that Rose or Martha or Amy lost their
54,breakfast on their first trip. 
55,DOCTOR: You seem to know an awful lot about me. 
56,O'DONNELL: I used to be in military intelligence. I was demoted for
57,dangling a colleague out of a window. 
58,DOCTOR: In anger? 
59,O'DONNELL: Is there another way to dangle someone out a window? What
60,year are we in? 
61,(The Doctor wets a finger and holds it up.)
62,DOCTOR: 1980. 
63,"O'DONNELL: So, pre-Harold Saxon. Pre-the Minister of War. Pre-the moon"
64,exploding and a big bat coming out. 
65,DOCTOR: The Minister of War? 
66,O'DONNELL: Yeah. 
67,"DOCTOR: No, never mind. I expect I'll find out soon enough. "
68,(Bennett comes out of the Tardis and closes the door.)
69,BENNETT: Sorry about that. Had a prawn sandwich. Might have been off. 
70,DOCTOR: Ah ha. Don't worry. Shall we go? 
71,"O'DONNELL: Just one sec, I've just"
72,got something in my boot. 
73,(The Doctor walks away. O'Donnell jumps up and down in excitement.)
74,"O'DONNELL: It's bigger on the inside, it's bigger on the"
75,"inside, it's bigger on the inside. How can it be bigger on the inside,"
76,"Bennett? (sobers up) Okay, let's roll."
77,[High Street]
78,
79,"(They catch up with the Doctor, walking past fake shop fronts, a telephone box and a poster of Stalin.)"
80,BENNETT: Why have we gone to Russia? 
81,"DOCTOR: Er, we haven't. We're still in Scotland. This is the town"
82,before it flooded. The Tardis has brought us to when
83,"the spaceship first touched down. But here and now, it's the height of"
84,the Cold War.
85,The military were being trained for offensives on Soviet soil. 
86,"(They find the spaceship with its rear ramp down, parked in front of"
87,the Orthodox Church.)
88,[Spaceship]
89,
90,(They go inside. The missing stasis chamber is in
91,"place, and a wrapped mummy is lying on the other one.)"
92,"O'DONNELL: Oh, is that the pilot? My God, look at size of it. "
93,"DOCTOR: No, that's the body. "
94,(Bennett opens the floor hatch where the two power cells are.)
95,"O'DONNELL: What do you mean, the body? "
96,DOCTOR: This isn't just any spaceship. It's a hearse. 
97,"BENNETT: The suspended animation chamber's still here, and the power"
98,cells for the engine. 
99,O'DONNELL: And there are no markings on the
100,wall. 
101,DOCTOR: Yet.
102,
103,[Outside the Church] 
104,
105,"(The undertaker runs to meet them as they walk down the ramp, carrying a"
106,briefcase and waving a large white handkerchief.)
107,PRENTIS: Greetings! 
108,O'DONNELL: It's him. That's the ghost from the Drum. 
109,"(The alien gets within an inch of the Doctor's nose, as if he is very short-sighted.)"
110," PRENTIS: Remarkable. Oh, and humans, too.  Albar Prentis, Funeral"
111,Director. 
112,(He hands out business cards. Albar Prentis Universal Funeral Director. 
113,May the remorse be with you. The Doctor throws his away.)
114,"BENNETT: You're from Tivoli, aren't you? "
115,PRENTIS: The most invaded
116,planet in the galaxy!
117,"Our capital city has a sign saying, if you occupied us, you'd be home"
118,by now. 
119,"DOCTOR: Yes, I've had dealings with"
120,your lot before.
121,I can't say I'm a fan. 
122,"PRENTIS: No, we do tend to antagonise. (laughs)"
123,(O'Donnell hears a noise and looks away briefly.)
124,DOCTOR: What are you doing here?
125,
126,"PRENTIS: Ah, yes. Of course."
127,(runs up the ramp) This
128,is the Fisher King.
129,He and his armies invaded Tivoli and
130,enslaved us for ten glorious years!
131,Until we were
132,liberated by the Arcateenians.
133,"But, thank the Gods,"
134,soon we'd irritated them
135,"so much, they enslaved us, too! (laughs)"
136,"BENNETT: My first proper alien, and he's an idiot. "
137,"PRENTIS: And now, in accordance with"
138,"Arcateenian custom,"
139,I've come to bury him
140,"on a barren, savage outpost. "
141,O'DONNELL: You mean the town? 
142,DOCTOR: He means the planet. 
143,(Prentis runs back down the ramp to the Doctor.)
144,"PRENTIS: Although, at the risk of starting"
145,"a bidding war, you could enslave me."
146,In the ship I have
147,directions to my planet
148,and a selection of items that you can
149,oppress me with. 
150,"DOCTOR: Listen, we've come from the future."
151,You're about to send some sort of
152,signal.
153,How do you do it? Is it
154,a special pen? 
155,PRENTIS: What are you talking about? 
156,DOCTOR: The technology you use. The thing that wrenches the soul
157,out of the body and makes it repeat
158,your coordinates for eternity.
159,"Give it to me now, I'm going"
160,to take the batteries out. 
161,PRENTIS: We don't have anything like that. (laughs)
162,Even this belongs to the
163,glorious Arcateenians. 
164,DOCTOR: So who sends the message? 
165,(Prentis sniffs at the Doctor. They look up at the mummy on the slab.)
166,DOCTOR: Back to the Tardis.
167,I need to talk to Clara. 
168,
169,[Mess hall]
170,
171,"(In the future, Cass is sitting observing the ghost Doctor floating just"
172,outside. Lunn approaches Clara who is sitting apart.)
173,"LUNN: You've bee here before,"
174,in situations like this before. 
175,"CLARA: Yeah, not exactly like, but, yeah, once or twice. "
176,LUNN: So you've had to deal with
177,people who are scared.
178,What do you say to them?
179,I'm asking what I should say to you. 
180,CLARA: That it will be all right. That the
181,Doctor will save us. 
182,"LUNN: And when you say it,"
183,do you believe it? 
184,"CLARA: Yeah. Yeah, I do. "
185,LUNN: And now? 
186,(Cass attracts their attention by slapping her chair back.)
187,LUNN: Cass thinks the Doctor's saying
188,something different to the others.
189,He's saying Moran Pritchard Apprentice.
190,"No, Prentis O'Donnell Clara Doctor Bennett Cass  "
191,It's a list of all our names
192,"and when he finishes, he just"
193,"goes back to the beginning again,"
194,over and over. That's it. 
195,CLARA: Who's Prentis? 
196,(Her mobile phone rings.)
197,CLARA: It's the Doctor. 
198,LUNN: He's alive? 
199,CLARA: For the moment. 
200,(Lunn signs the good news to Cass.)
201,"CLARA: Doctor? Doctor, are you all right? "
202,"DOCTOR : Yeah, fine. So listen,"
203,"the spaceship, it's a hearse."
204,
205,
206,[Tardis / Mess hall]
207,
208,(The Doctor on the phone propped up against a mug
209,"on a table, Clara on the scanner.)"
210,"DOCTOR: Clara, what's wrong? "
211,CLARA: Another ghost has appeared. 
212,DOCTOR: What? Who? Has someone died? 
213,"CLARA: Doctor,"
214,it's you. Are you okay? 
215,"DOCTOR: Yeah. Well, currently. "
216,CLARA: What does it mean? 
217,DOCTOR: It means I die. 
218,"CLARA: No, not necessarily. We can change"
219,the sequence of events so 
220,DOCTOR: This isn't a potential future. This is the future
221,now.  It's already happened.
222,The proof is right
223,there in front of you.
224,I have to die. 
225,CLARA: No.
226,You can change things. 
227,DOCTOR: I can't.
228,"Even the tiniest change, the"
229,ramifications could be catastrophic.
230,It could spread carnage
231,and chaos across the universe
232,"like ripples on a pond. Oh, well, I've had a good innings."
233,"(to O'Donnell) This regeneration, it's"
234,a bit of a clerical error anyway. (to Clara)
235,I've got to go sometime. 
236,CLARA: Not with me!
237,Die with whoever comes after me.
238,You do not leave me. 
239,"DOCTOR: Clara, I need to talk to you"
240,just on your own. 
241,(They pick up their respective handsets.)
242,DOCTOR: Listen to me.
243,We all have to face death
244,"eventually, be it ours or someone else's. "
245,CLARA: I'm not ready yet.
246,I don't want to
247,"think about that, not yet. "
248,DOCTOR: I can't change what's already
249,happened. There are rules. 
250,CLARA: So break them.
251,"And anyway, you owe me."
252,You've made yourself essential to me.
253,"You've given me something else to,"
254,to be. And you can't do that
255,and then die. It's not fair. 
256,DOCTOR: Clara. 
257,CLARA: No.
258,"Doctor, I don't care about your"
259,rules or your bloody survivor's
260,guilt.
261,"If you love me in any way,"
262,you'll come back.
263,"Doctor, are you? "
264,DOCTOR: I can't save Moran or Pritchard. 
265,"CLARA: No, but like you said, if you can, if you can"
266,"find out why this is happening,"
267,maybe you can stop them killing
268,"anybody else, you can save us."
269,And you can stop it
270,happening to you. 
271,"DOCTOR: I'll do what I can,"
272,but the future has already happened.
273,We've just met the Undertaker
274,and he's still alive. 
275,(Prentis is making notes in a book as he walks
276,into the spaceship and discovers that the mummy wrappings are empty. He
277,"gasps, sniff, then turns and sees the symbols scratched into the bulkhead. A"
278,very large shadow looms in the opening to the spaceship. We are treated to an external view of the spaceship and hear a loud
279,roar. 
280,"In the Tardis, the private conversation is over and the Doctor"
281,goes back to speaker mode.)
282,DOCTOR: So. Ghost me. You've got a better view than me.
283,How do I look?
284,"Any signs of trauma, any scars?"
285,Any clues as to how I die? 
286,"CLARA: No, nothing."
287,You're the same as all the other
288,ghosts with the weird black
289,eyes and.
290,"No. No, wait. Your coat."
291,It's torn. The right shoulder. 
292,(She holds up the phone to broadcast the image.)
293,DOCTOR: I assume I'm just saying
294,the same thing as the others. 
295,CLARA: No. You're saying a list of names.
296,"Our names, mainly. Moran, Pritchard, Prentis,"
297,"O'Donnell, Clara, Doctor, Bennett, Cass."
298,Who's Prentis? 
299,DOCTOR: The mole-faced chap.
300,
301,(Ghost Doctor comes through the window. Clara drops the phone on a
302,table for a moment.)
303,"DOCTOR: What's the matter, Clara,"
304,what's happening? 
305,CLARA: You've moved inside.
306,You're inside here now. 
307,DOCTOR: What am I doing? 
308,"CLARA: Er, nothing. You're,"
309,you're just standing there. 
310,DOCTOR: I'm not trying to kill you?
311,Why am I not trying to kill you? 
312,"CLARA: No, wait, you're moving,"
313,going toward the control panel. 
314,(The ghost calls up the Faraday cage in sector 4. Status: closed
315,changes to open.)
316,"CLARA: Oh, no."
317,He's opened the Faraday cage.
318,He's let the other ghosts out. 
319,DOCTOR: I need to talk to me now. 
320,CLARA: Didn't you hear me?
321,You opened the Faraday cage.
322,The other ghosts are outside.
323,Shouldn't we be hiding? 
324,DOCTOR: In a minute.
325,I need to talk to the ghost me. 
326,"(Clara puts the phone on its long edge, on a cabinet.)"
327,"CLARA: Okay, Doctor, you're on. "
328,DOCTOR: Doctor. Such an honour.
329,I've always been a huge admirer.
330,This is really a delight.
331,Finally someone worth talking to.
332,"So firstly, why are you here? "
333,(Ghost Doctor turns away.)
334,"DOCTOR: Clara? Clara, what's happening? "
335,(She retrieves her phone.)
336,CLARA: Er.
337,"Er, you, you've just stopped."
338,"Oh, no, wait, you've started again."
339,
340,CASS via LUNN: His message has changed. He's saying something
341,different.
342,He's saying 
343,CLARA: What?
344,DOCTOR: What? 
345,LUNN: What?
346,
347,"CASS via LUNN: He's saying, the chamber will open tonight. "
348,"DOCTOR: Clara, now the ghosts are out,"
349,go to the Faraday cage.
350,They won't be able to get
351,"you in there. Oh, there's a problem. "
352,"CLARA: Problem? What problem? Oh, really? Because"
353,everything else is going so
354,smoothly 
355,DOCTOR: The phone signal won't be able to get through.
356,"What you'll have to do,"
357,"Clara, put the phone outside,"
358,and you can watch it through
359,"the little round porthole. And when you see it ringing, if it's"
360,"safe to do so, go out and answer it. "
361,"CLARA: Okay, how long are you going to "
362,"DOCTOR: Clara, listen to me."
363,Don't let that phone
364,out of your sight.
365,"I need to be able to reach you, I"
366,need to know everything my ghost
367,does.
368,Do you understand?
369,I'll come back for you. I swear. 
370,"(Clara, Cass and Lunn run out.)"
371,
372,[Tardis]
373,
374,(Signal lost.)
375,"DOCTOR: Come on. Oh, wait a minute."
376,"Not you, O'Donnell. "
377,O'DONNELL: Why not? 
378,DOCTOR: Someone needs to stay here
379,and mind the shop.
380,What if Clara calls? 
381,O'DONNELL: The last bloke that said
382,something like that to me
383,got dangled out of a window. 
384,BENNETT: Maybe the Doctor's right. Maybe it's best if you stay here. 
385,"O'DONNELL: Never going to happen. Seriously,"
386,have you two met me?
387,(O'Donnell walks between the men and leaves the Tardis. Bennett and the Doctor exchange a Look.) 
388,
389,[Spaceship]
390,
391,(They see the undertaker lying on the bandages and
392,run in.)
393,DOCTOR: Prentis.
394,Prentis! 
395,(The Doctor checks for a pulse.)
396,O'DONNELL: Guess that dead body wasn't so dead
397,after all. 
398,BENNETT: And now we've got the writing. 
399,DOCTOR: The Fisher King did it himself.
400,The future is still coming.
401,
402,
403,[Outside the Church]
404,
405,(There are drag marks in the soil outside.)
406,DOCTOR: He's taken the suspended animation
407,chamber to the church.
408,
409,(There is a big roar.)
410,O'DONNELL: What was that?
411,
412,DOCTOR: We need to get back to the Tardis.
413,Now!
414,
415,"(They run, but a louder roar makes them stop and duck into a narrow"
416,passageway.)
417,
418,[Building]
419,DOCTOR: It's cut us off.
420,
421,O'DONNELL: Let's split up.
422,"Go on, Bennett."
423,
424,(She has to dodge around a corner near a tableau of a living room
425,while the Doctor and Bennett make it into a fake bathroom at the end. Bennett
426,jams a chair under the door handle.
427,Something big is stomping and
428,roaring as it approaches. It passes a broken window in the room where
429,the Doctor and Bennett are hiding. The sounds fade. O'Donnell steps out
430,"of her hiding place, and a large shadow is cast over her. She turns."
431,Big
432,roar. Bennett pulls the chair from the door.)
433,"DOCTOR: No, Bennett! Wait!"
434,
435,"(Bennett runs to where O'Donnell is lying on the floor, moaning, He"
436,"kneels and takes her hand, then takes her in his arms.)"
437,BENNETT: Why did you come? You shouldn't have
438,"come. I mean, you never listen to anyone. It drives me"
439,mad.
440,
441,"O'DONNELL: To keep an eye on you, idiot."
442,"So, don't die."
443,
444,BENNETT: No.
445,(O'Donnell dies. The Doctor walks up slowly.)
446,BENNETT: Who's next on the list?
447,
448,"(Bennett lays O'Donnell down, takes off his glasses and stand to face"
449,the Doctor.)
450,"BENNETT: That list your ghost was saying,"
451,that's the order in which people are
452,"going to die, isn't it?"
453,"I mean,"
454,I've only just figured that out.
455,"But you knew that all along, didn't you?"
456,
457,"Moran, Pritchard, Prentis,"
458,O'Donnell.
459,
460,"DOCTOR: I thought perhaps, because her ghost"
461,"wasn't there in the future,"
462,"like Prentis's was,"
463,"I thought maybe,"
464,maybe it wouldn't happen. Maybe she stood a chance.
465,
466,"BENNETT: Yeah, but you didn't try very hard"
467,"to stop her, though, did you?"
468,It was almost like you wanted to
469,test your theory.
470,So who's next?
471,
472,DOCTOR: Clara.
473,
474,BENNETT: Yeah.
475,Yeah. Except now you're going to do
476,"something about it, aren't you? Yeah, because it's getting closer to"
477,you.
478,You change
479,history to save
480,yourself but not to save O'Donnell.
481,You wouldn't save her.
482,
483,DOCTOR: This isn't about saving me.
484,I'm a dead man walking.
485,I'm changing history to save Clara.
486,
487,(Bennett walks away.)
488,
489,[Faraday cage]
490,
491,"(Clara is at the door, staring at the phone stood"
492,"on a ledge opposite. Suddenly a figure appears before her, and she"
493,jumps back.)
494,CLARA: O'Donnell's dead.
495,
496,"(Clara, Cass and Lunn watch ghost O'Donnell turn away.)"
497,"CLARA: Oh, no. No, no, no, no,"
498,don't you dare. Don't you dare.
499,(The ghost takes the phone and walks down the corridor.)
500,[Tardis]
501,
502,DOCTOR: Big day for you.
503,"Time travel, twice!"
504,
505,"BENNETT: Whoa, really? When are we going to?"
506,
507,DOCTOR: Off the map.
508,Out of the rule book. What
509,if I don't die? What if I refuse?
510,I'm going to go back to the base
511,"and I'm going to save Clara, because"
512,that's what I do. And I don't see
513,anyone here who's going to stop me.
514,
515,(The Cloister Bell tolls and the Tardis materialises.)
516,
517,[Location 512]
518,
519,(512 is in big numbers on the wall above a paper target of a soldier.)
520,DOCTOR: Why are we still here?
521,
522,"(Then he sees another Tardis round the corner, with himself walking out"
523,of it.)
524,"DOCTOR: No. No, no, no, no, no."
525,
526,BENNETT: What?
527,
528,DOCTOR: We've moved half an hour backwards.
529,I'm locked in my own time stream.
530,The Tardis won't let me leave.
531,
532,"BENNETT: Well, what do we do?"
533,
534,"DOCTOR: Now we have to keep out of sight,"
535,until time catches up.
536,
537,(They walk away.)
538,LATER DOCTOR: Where's Bennett? We need to get
539,going. 
540,"LATER O'DONNELL: Oh, he's still throwing up."
541,(They see the undertaker taking sextant sightings.)
542,BENNETT: Prentis. He's alive.
543,
544,"DOCTOR: No, he's just not dead yet."
545,And we don't tell him.
546,
547,"BENNETT: Yeah, but he's right there. I mean,"
548,we can just
549,
550,DOCTOR: No! 
551,(The Doctor pushes Bennett against the wall.)
552,"DOCTOR: However that sentence ends,"
553,"no, we can't."
554,"Save him,"
555,and you'll want to save O'Donnell.
556,You can't cheat time.
557,I just tried.
558,You can't just go back
559,and cut off tragedy at the root.
560,Because you find yourself talking to
561,someone you just saw dead on a slab.
562,Because then you really do
563,see ghosts.
564,We don't tell him.
565,Understand? Not a word.
566,We don't have that right. 
567,[Outside the Church]
568,
569,"(Instead, they hide behind some metal barrels labelled toxic waste and"
570,watch the conversation they had in half an hours time.)
571,"LATER PRENTIS: Albar Prentis, Funeral Director."
572,
573,"LATER BENNETT: You're from Tivoli, aren't you?"
574,
575,LATER PRENTIS: The most invaded
576,planet in the galaxy!
577,"Our capital city has a sign saying, if you occupied us, you'd be home"
578,by now. 
579,"LATER DOCTOR: Yes, I've"
580,had dealings with your lot before.
581,I can't say I'm a fan.
582,
583,"LATER PRENTIS: No, we do tend to antagonise!"
584,
585,(Later O'Donnell smiles at the Star Wars joke on Prentis's business 
586,card. Bennett gets up and the Doctor wrestles him to the ground. 
587,O'Donnell
588,hears the thud but sees nothing.)
589,LATER DOCTOR: What are you doing here? 
590,"LATER PRENTIS: Ah, yes. Of"
591,course.
592,
593,
594,[Faraday cage]
595,
596,CLARA: The dark. The sword.
597,The forsaken. The temple.
598,When we found out what the
599,"ghosts were saying,"
600,we weren't surprised because the
601,"words, they were already inside us."
602,
603,"(Lunn is signing all this for Cass, of course.)"
604,"CLARA: But you, you were, weren't you?"
605,You didn't know what the
606,words were going to be.
607,
608,"LUNN: Er, no, I didn't. How did you know?"
609,
610,CLARA: Who was the one person who didn't
611,see the writing in the spaceship?
612,
613,LUNN: Me. Cass wouldn't let me go inside.
614,
615,CLARA: That's why the ghosts didn't hurt
616,you when they had the chance.
617,The message isn't inside you.
618,
619,"LUNN: Yes, I suppose that makes sense."
620,
621,CLARA: So you can get the phone back.
622,
623,LUNN: What? 
624,(Cass queries Lunn.)
625,LUNN: She's saying I should go
626,and get the phone back.
627,
628,CASS: No.
629,
630,"CLARA: Listen, listen. I need."
631,"We, we need to be able to"
632,contact the Doctor
633,and you are the only one who can do
634,this.
635,
636,LUNN: Okay
637,
638,(Cass grabs Lunn by the lapels and signs at him very fiercely while Clara checks if the coast is clear.)
639,"LUNN: No, she's right."
640,Neither of you can get it back.
641,
642,(Cass signs again.)
643,CLARA: What? What is it? What did she say?
644,
645,LUNN: It doesn't matter.
646,
647,CLARA: Please.
648,
649,LUNN: She said to ask you whether
650,travelling with the Doctor
651,"changed you,"
652,or were you always happy to put
653,other people's lives at risk.
654,
655,CLARA: He taught me
656,to do what has to be done.
657,You should get going.
658,
659,(Clara opens the Faraday cage door.)
660,
661,[Outside the Church]
662,
663,(The Doctor and
664,"Bennett watch their other selves walk away, and Prentis go into the"
665,"spaceship. They stand, and the Doctor sees that he has torn his coat in"
666,their brief struggle.) 
667,DOCTOR: Oh. I need more time. It's too soon.
668,I haven't saved her yet.
669,"Tick tock, tick tock,"
670,"tick tock, tick tock, tick tock."
671,"I've got no choice now,"
672,I have to face the Fisher King.
673,"You, back to the Tardis."
674,
675,
676,[Outside the Faraday
677,cage]
678,
679,(Lunn sets off down the corridor.)
680,"CLARA: Look, he'll be fine, I promise."
681,
682,"(Cass signs at her, short and angry.)"
683,CLARA: Okay. Didn't need anyone to
684,translate that. 
685,(She rejoins Cass in the cage and closes the door.) 
686,
687,[Outside the Church]
688,
689,(The Doctor stops outside the Church.)
690,DOCTOR: Now I'm ready.

694,
695,"(It's not a real church, but an old warehouse or similar with Orthodox Christian crosses on the roof. He goes down"
696,a
697,metal staircase to a storage area with metal support posts. The open
698,suspended animation chamber is here.)
699,DOCTOR: I've come from the future.
700,I've seen the chaos you cause. The bloodshed.
701,
702,FISHER KING : Tell me what you have seen.
703,
704,DOCTOR: Ghosts. 
705,FISHER KING : Ghosts?
706,
707,DOCTOR: Souls wrenched from the dead.
708,"Repeating directions to here,"
709,"to this spot, over and over."
710,
711,FISHER KING : How many ghosts do I create?
712,How many!
713,DOCTOR: Four that I know of. Maybe five by
714,now.
715,Probably more since I left.
716,
717,FISHER KING : My ghosts will make more ghosts.
718,Enough to bring an armada.
719,Enough to wake me from my sleep.
720,
721,"(Back in the future, the suspended animation chamber in the main"
722,hangar suddenly activates. Lunn finds
723,the
724,four ghosts having a conference. They notice him and surround him. Lunn
725,closes his eyes and stands very still as they study him closely. When
726,"they stand back, he opens his eyes and walks slowly on.)"
727,(Stomping.)
728,DOCTOR: What will happen
729,when your people arrive?
730,
731,FISHER KING : We will drain the oceans
732,and put the humans in chains.
733,
734,"DOCTOR: This world is protected, by me."
735,
736,FISHER KING : Yes.
737,"One man,"
738,lost in time.

744,it and turns to run out.)
745,COMPUTER: Door emergency security lock.
746,(The door slams in his face. The ghosts walk past.)
747,
748,[Basement]
749,
750,FISHER KING: The seed of their destruction is
751,already sown. They will die.
752,The message will be sent.
753,"My people will come, and you will do"
754,"nothing to stop it,"
755,Time Lord.
756,
757,"(We finally see him. About three metres tall, with mandibles and spiky"
758,"plate armour, and holding a large hand weapon. This giant insectoid is not the Wounded King who guarded"
759,the Grail in the legends any more than the Bors we met earlier was the gallant survivor of
760,the Quest.)

764,(Cass goes to open the door. Clara stops her.)
765,"CLARA: Hey! No, no, no, no. Cass!"
766,"Wait, what are you doing?"
767,"Look, Lunn, he is going to be fine,"
768,I promise.
769,We have to stay here.
770,I know that look. I do that look.
771,"Okay, fine. But we stick together."
772,
773,"(Cass nods, and they leave, Clara closing the door behind them.)"
774,
775,[Basement]
776,
777,"FISHER KING: Time Lords. Cowardly,"
778,vain curators
779,who suddenly remembered
780,they had teeth
781,and became the most warlike
782,race in the galaxy.
783,"But you, you!"
784,
785,"(The Doctor staggers, bent backwards over the open suspended animation"
786,chamber.)
787,FISHER KING: You are curious.
788,"You have seen the words, too."
789,I can hear them tick inside you.
790,But you are still
791,locked in your history.
792,Still slavishly protecting Time.
793,Willing to die rather than change
794,a word of the future.
795,
796,
797,[Intersection]
798,
799,CLARA: (sotto) Lunn.
800,
801,(Clara turns right and doesn't notice that Cass has turned left.)
802,CLARA: (sotto) Lunn.
803,Lunn.
804,"(turns round) Oh, Cass."
805,Cass.
806,Cass.
807,Idiot. I'm an idiot.

810,"She cannot hear him, of course. but she is wary.)"
811,
812,[Basement]
813,
814,FISHER KING: You will be a strong beacon.
815,How many ghosts can I make of you?
816,
817,"DOCTOR: You know, you've got"
818,a lot in common with the Tivoleans. You'll both do anything to survive.
819,They'll surrender to anyone.
820,You will hijack other people's souls
821,and turn them into electromagnetic
822,projections.
823,That will to endure. That refusal to ever cease.
824,It's extraordinary.
825,And it makes a fella think. Because you know what? If all I have
826,to do to survive is tweak the future
827,"a bit, what's stopping me?"
828,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,"
829,yeah. The ripple effect.
830,Maybe it will mean that the universe
831,"will be ruled by cats or something,"
832,in the future.
833,"But the way I see it,"
834,even a ghastly future is better than
835,no future at all.
836,You robbed those
837,"people of their deaths, made them nothing more than"
838,a message in a bottle.
839,You violated something more
840,important than Time.
841,You bent the rules of life
842,and death.
843,So I am putting things straight.
844,"Here, now,"
845,this is where your story ends.
846,
847,(The Fisher King growls.)

849,[Corridor]
850,
851,(Back in the main
852,"hangar, the suspended animation chamber is counting down to opening."
853,Moran is catching up with Cass. A sixth sense makes her squat and place
854,her hand flat on the floor. She feels the vibrations of the scraping
855,"axe, stands, turns and runs through Moran as he swings the axe. He"
856,vanishes and the axe falls. Cass runs into Clara.)
857,"CLARA: Oh, there you"
858,are.
859,(Cass grabs her hand and they run.)
860,
861,[Basement]
862,FISHER KING: There is nothing you can do.
863,
864,(The Fisher King aims his big energy weapon at the Doctor.)
865,DOCTOR: I've already done it.
866,The words have gone.
867,I got rid of them.
868,"The future I saw,"
869,none of that will happen now.
870,The message will never contaminate
871,my friends. No one will die. No one is coming to save you.
872,That's the thing
873,about knowing you're going to die.
874,You've got nothing left to lose.

880,(Cass and Clara enter.)
881,"LUNN: No, no, you've got to get out of"

883,The ghosts locked me in.
884,It's a trap.

888,[Spaceship]
889,
890,(The Fisher King leaves the Church and stomps into
891,the spaceship. The symbols are still on the bulkhead.)
892,FISHER KING: The Time Lord lied.
893,
894,(One of the power cells is missing. It is over by the dam at the back
895,of
896,"the town, beeping away its count-down. The Fisher King leaves the"

911,"CLARA: Back, get back."
912,
913,"(They bump up against the suspended animation chamber, which starts"
914,clunking as the four human ghosts enter. 
915,Back in 1980. the dam starts to crumble. The Fisher King
916,continues to just stand there until he realises what is going on and
917,roars. He opens his arms wide and the rush of water carries him off at
918,speed.  
919,"In the now, the suspended animation chamber opens and"
920,the
921,"Doctor sits up, wearing his sonic sunglasses. He takes them off.)"
922,DOCTOR: Don't kiss me. Morning breath.
923,
924,CLARA: Doctor?
925,
926,(He leaps out of the chamber.)
927,DOCTOR: Follow me.
928,
929,
930,[Bridge]
931,
932,(The Doctor puts his shades earpiece into a handy
933,socket on a console. The Fisher King's roar is heard.)
934,CLARA: What's that noise?
935,
936,DOCTOR: It's the call of the Fisher King.
937,The call of their master.
938,
939,(The four human ghosts turn around at the sound and walk through a wall.)
940,CLARA: Where are they going? 
941,"(They watch on CCTV as all the ghosts walk into the Faraday cage, where"
942,the Doctor ghost is creating the Fisher King roar. The Doctor remotely
943,closes the door and the Doctor ghost flickers out of existence. 
944,Later -)
945,CLARA: (wearing the sunglasses) So what was it? Your ghost.
946,
947,DOCTOR: A hologram.
948,Like the one we made of you to lure
949,the ghosts into the Faraday cage.
950,With a soupçon
951,"of artificial intelligence,"
952,and a few pre-recorded
953,phrases thrown in.
954,
955,"(Clara is about to take the glasses off, but he slaps her hands.)"
956,DOCTOR: Ah!
957,
958,(Then he removes them.)
959,DOCTOR: All beamed from the sonic glasses.
960,
961,(Clara gets up and Cass takes her place. The Doctor puts the glasses on
962,her.)
963,DOCTOR: As soon as you brought me and the
964,"chamber on board, it connected"
965,with the base's wi-fi and Bob's your
966,"uncle, you've got a ghost Doctor."
967,
968,CLARA: Why did they only come out at night?
969,
970,DOCTOR: Because they're electromagnetic
971,projections that were
972,out of phase with
973,the base's day mode. Right.
974,(He takes his shades off Cass.)
975,DOCTOR: That's it. I've erased
976,the memory of the writing.
977,Though you might find you've lost
978,"a couple of other memories too. You know, like people you went to"
979,"school with, or"
980,previous addresses or how to drink
981,liquids.
982,That's you two done.
983,Where's Bennett?
984,
985,
986,[Outside the Faraday cage]
987,
988,"(The ghosts are walking about inside, occasionally"
989,looking at Bennett.)
990,BENNETT: What will happen to them?
991,
992,DOCTOR: UNIT will cut out
993,the Faraday cage
994,with them inside and take it away.
995,Then the space-hearse will be
996,"destroyed,"
997,so the writing doesn't
998,infect anyone else.
999,
1000,BENNETT: What do I do now?
1001,
1002,DOCTOR: I don't understand.
1003,
1004,CLARA: I do.
1005,You keep going. You have to.
1006,"Take it from me, there is"
1007,"a whole world out there. A galaxy, a life."
1008,What would O'Donnell have wanted?
1009,
1010,DOCTOR: I need to erase
1011,"that message from your mind,"
1012,"but it's fine, I'll do it later."
1013,
1014,(The Doctor walks a little way back down the corridor.)
1015,BENNETT: Lunn. Will you translate
1016,something to Cass for me?
1017,
1018,LUNN: Of course.
1019,
1020,BENNETT: Tell her that you're in love with her and
1021,that you always have been. 
1022,LUNN: What?
1023,
1024,BENNETT: Tell her there is no point
1025,wasting time because things happen
1026,and then it's too late.
1027,Tell her I wish someone had given me
1028,that advice.
1029,
1030,(Cass queries Lunn and he passes on the message. Cass looks quizzically at Bennett.)
1031,"LUNN: Oh, God, no."
1032,"I was just passing on what he said. Please, don't feel"
1033,
1034,(Cass grabs Lunn and kisses him.)
1035,
1036,[Tardis]
1037,
1038,CLARA: What will UNIT do with the ghosts?
1039,
1040,"DOCTOR: Drag the cage into space, away from"
1041,the Earth's magnetic field.
1042,"With nothing to sustain them,"
1043,the ghosts will eventually fade away.
1044,
1045,CLARA: Here's what I don't understand.
1046,You did change the future.
1047,You stopped the Fisher King
1048,from returning.
1049,
1050,DOCTOR: The Fisher King had been
1051,dead for a hundred and fifty years
1052,before we even got here.
1053,"But once I went back,"
1054,I became part of events.
1055,But here's the thing.
1056,"The messages my ghost gave, they"
1057,"weren't for you, they were for me."
1058,That list. Everyone after you
1059,"was random, but you"
1060,"being the next name, that's what"
1061,made me confront the Fisher King.
1062,
1063,CLARA: And saying the chamber will open?
1064,
1065,DOCTOR: That was me telling me to get inside
1066,and when to set it for.
1067,
1068,CLARA: Smart.
1069,
1070,DOCTOR: Except that's not why I said them.
1071,
1072,CLARA: How do you mean?
1073,
1074,DOCTOR: I programmed my ghost to say them
1075,because that's
1076,what my ghost had said.
1077,And the only reason I created
1078,my ghost hologram in the first place
1079,was because I saw it here.
1080,I was reverse engineering
1081,the narrative.
1082,
1083,"CLARA: Okay, that's still pretty smart."
1084,
1085,DOCTOR: You do not understand.
1086,When did
1087,"I first have those ideas, Clara?"
1088,
1089,"CLARA: Well, it must have been (penny drops)"
1090,Wow. 
1091,DOCTOR: Exactly.
1092,Who composed Beethoven's Fifth?
