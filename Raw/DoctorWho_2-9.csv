17,One - The Watcher 
18, [Tardis]
19,
20,(The hum of the Tardis is broken only by the
21,ticking of a very ornate clock.) 
22,"VICKI: I shall miss them, Doctor. "
23,DOCTOR: Who? 
24,VICKI: Ian and Barbara. 
25,"DOCTOR: Yes, I shall miss them too. First Susan and now them. Come over"
26,"here, my dear, I'd like to talk to you. "
27,VICKI: What about the control panel? 
28,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's all right, my dear. It's already set. Their decision"
29,"certainly surprised me, although it shouldn't, I know. But it was quite"
30,obvious they intended to take the first opportunity of going back home.
31,
32,"VICKI: Well, they weren't getting any younger, were they? "
33,"DOCTOR: It's lucky for you child, they're not here to hear you say"
34,that. Good gracious me. You think they're old? What do you think of me?
35,
36,"VICKI: You're different, Doctor. Anyway, we may land in their time one"
37,day and be able to talk over old times. 
38,"DOCTOR: Well, perhaps Vicki, perhaps. "
39,"VICKI: Anyway, it's done now. I wonder where the Tardis'll take us"
40,next? 
41,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's done now, although I must admit I'm left with a small"
42,worry. 
43,"VICKI: You know, I wouldn't mind New York. I didn't get to see a lot of"
44,"it, what with the Daleks and everything. But what I saw from the top of"
45,"the Empire State Building, I wouldn't mind going back there. "
46,"DOCTOR: My dear Vicki, I'm trying to talk to you. "
47,"VICKI: Oh, sorry. "
48,"DOCTOR: I just wanted to ask you, are you sure you didn't want to go"
49,"home too? I didn't give you very much time to consider now, did I? I"
50,should hate to think that you're just staying for the sake of an old
51,man. 
52,"VICKI: Oh, Doctor! I made my decision. I wanted to stay. Anyway, I"
53,wouldn't have anything to go back to. 
54,"DOCTOR: Yes, your father "
55,(Rattle) 
56,VICKI: Did you hear that? 
57,"DOCTOR: Yes, perhaps it's something fallen down, or maybe we've changed"
58,course. 
59,(Thump) 
60,"VICKI: (sotto) There's someone in the living quarters. Doctor, be"
61,careful. It's obviously a Dalek. 
62,(The Doctor takes off his jacket to throw over the eye-piece. The doors
63,"open, and a"
64,ragged man carrying a stuffed toy staggers out and falls on the floor.)
65,
66,VICKI: Steven!
67,
68, [Clifftop]
69,
70,(The Tardis materialise on a beach. A monk on the
71,cliff top observes it.) 
72,"MONK: I wonder. Oh, I wonder."
73,
74, [Tardis]
75,
76," STEVEN: Thanks. Sorry about that, Doc. "
77,VICKI: We thought you were dead. 
78,"STEVEN: Well, I nearly was. I just managed to climb down that cable"
79,before it burned out. Then I came after you. 
80,VICKI: You should have shouted. 
81,"STEVEN: Should have? I never stopped! Say, this is quite a ship you've"
82,"got here, Doc. Never seen anything like it. "
83,"DOCTOR: Now listen to me, young man. Sit down. Now, there are two"
84,"things you can do. One, sit there until you get your breath back, and"
85,"two, don't call me Doc! Now do I make myself clear? "
86,"STEVEN: Yes, yes, whatever you say, Doc-tor! "
87,"DOCTOR: Apart from that young man, I'm quite willing to accept you at"
88,your face value. 
89,VICKI: You were lucky to find the Tardis in all that jungle. 
90,"STEVEN: Yeah, we were lucky. You know, I don't seem to remember much"
91,about it. There was a door. I went through it. I must have flaked out.
92,"I remember registering that, well, it didn't look like a ship. It was"
93,very small. I must have been delirious. 
94,VICKI: I don't suppose you were. It is very small outside. It's just in
95,here it's big. 
96,"STEVEN: Oh, come off it! "
97,"VICKI: You don't believe me, do you? "
98,"STEVEN: Oh, of course I do, Vicki. Every word. "
99,"VICKI: This isn't an ordinary ship, you know. This is a time machine. "
100,"STEVEN: Time? Look, this ship may have a way-out design, but time"
101,machines? That's ridiculous. 
102,VICKI: Doctor? He says the Tardis isn't a time machine. 
103,"DOCTOR: Oh, does he now? "
104,VICKI: Tell him. 
105,"DOCTOR: I don't see why I should, my child. He'll learn soon enough. "
106,"STEVEN: Look, Doctor, I've seen some spaceships in my time, admittedly"
107,"nothing like this. Well, what does this do? "
108,"DOCTOR: That is the dematerialising control and that, over yonder, is"
109,"the horizontal hold. Up there is the scanner, those are the doors, that"
110,"is a chair with a panda on it. Sheer poetry, dear boy. Now please stop"
111,bothering me. 
112,"STEVEN: Look, you gave this ship a name just now, what was it? "
113,"VICKI: Tardis, T A R D I S. It stands for Time And Relative Dimensions"
114,In Space. 
115,STEVEN: IDBI. 
116,VICKI: What? IDBI? 
117,STEVEN: I D B I. 
118,VICKI: Yes? 
119,STEVEN: It means I Don't Believe It. 
120,"VICKI: You'll see, you'll see. "
121,DOCTOR: Vicki? 
122,VICKI: Yes? 
123,DOCTOR: I've checked up on all the readings. Now I think our guest will
124,need a wash and brush up. So I think the best thing for you to do is go
125,and find him some clothes and a cloak. Bring mine as well. We'll show
126,him whether this is a time machine or not. 
127,VICKI: Where are we? 
128,"DOCTOR: Well, judging by the readings, my child, I think we've landed"
129,on the planet Earth.
130,
131,[Village]
132,
133,"(A woman puts a cauldron on a fire, It's Hur from the Stone"
134,"Age, or rather, a descendant.) "
135,ELDRED: Wulnoth with you? 
136,EDITH: Inside. 
137,ELDRED: Something's landed on the beach. I saw it from the cliff. 
138,WULNOTH: What is it? 
139,"ELDRED: A large box washed ashore by the tide, probably from a ship. I"
140,"didn't go down, I came for you. "
141,WULNOTH: What sort of box? 
142,ELDRED: I don't know. It's just very big. I've never seen anything like
143,it before. 
144,WULNOTH: The tide'll be turning. We must hurry. You lead the way. 
145,EDITH: It's a long way to the beach and back. What about your meal?
146,
147, [Beach]
148,
149,(The Doctor is examining a metal helm with horns
150,on) 
151,"DOCTOR: Where did you say you found this, Vicki? "
152,VICKI: Just down there. I saw it as soon as I came out of the ship. 
153,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's a bit rusted but, er, it's not as old as that. Tenth,"
154,"eleventh century? England. Well, there you are, young man. What do you"
155,"think of that now, eh? A Viking helmet. "
156,"STEVEN: Oh, maybe. "
157,"DOCTOR: What do you mean, maybe? What do you think it is, a space"
158,helmet for a cow? 
159,"STEVEN: Look, it could just as easily be part of a costume. You know, a"
160,toy left here by a child. 
161,"DOCTOR: Oh, rubbish, rubbish. "
162,"STEVEN: No more so than your theory. Though your ship is, to say the"
163,"least, a little unusual. "
164,"DOCTOR: Oh, I see, so you've changed your idea's now. "
165,"STEVEN: If it is a time machine, I'm not saying it is, mind you, but if"
166,"it is, shouldn't you know where we are? You know, your control panel? "
167,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, but unfortunately, we have a slight technical"
168,hitch at the moment. Excuse me. 
169,"VICKI: As a matter of fact, we never know where we're going to land"
170,next. 
171,"STEVEN: Oh, so assuming I believe what you tell me, you can't take me"
172,home. 
173,VICKI: Not by any direct route. Let's go exploring now? 
174,"DOCTOR: Yes, perhaps we should find a village whereby we can convince"
175,this young upstart of the true facts. 
176,"STEVEN: Oh, great, Doctor. I'm all for that. But there is one thing"
177,that bothers me. 
178,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes? What is it now? "
179,"STEVEN: Well, how come you chose such an unusual design for your ship?"
180,A Police telephone box? Is that right? 
181,"(The Monk is hiding behind a rock, listening to them) "
182,"DOCTOR: The design is completely immaterial, young man. The Tardis is"
183,required to land and blend in with its surroundings. 
184,STEVEN: Blend in? 
185,"DOCTOR: Yes, quite so. For instance, If we were to land in the middle"
186,"of the Indian mutiny, well, I'm sure the ship could possibly take on"
187,the appearance of a howdah. 
188,STEVEN: How-what? 
189,DOCTOR: A Howdah! A carrier on the back of an elephant. 
190,"STEVEN: Oh, I see. Oh, and, and if it landed on the pebbles/ "
191,DOCTOR: On the what? 
192,"STEVEN: If it landed on the beach against the cliffs, it'd take on the"
193,appearance of a large rock? 
194,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, yes, but you do keep on, don't you. "
195,"STEVEN: Do you wonder why I don't believe you? You know, that large"
196,rock over there looks exactly like a Police telephone box. 
197,VICKI: That is merely another technical hitch and the Doctor will
198,"repair it one day. Anyway, if we're going to do any exploring we should"
199,"do it now, 'cos it's going to get dark in a minute. "
200,DOCTOR: Now I suggest we take a walk along the beach and try and find a
201,spot where the cliffs run down to sea level. 
202,"STEVEN: Yeah, but that could be miles. It'd be much quicker to go up"
203,here. 
204,"DOCTOR: Yes, so possibly it might, but I'm not a mountain goat and I"
205,"prefer walking to it any day, and I hate climbing! "
206,"VICKI: We'll go with you, Doctor. "
207,"DOCTOR: No, you won't, you'll stay with the ship and wait 'til I've got"
208,to the top then you can both climb up and join me. 
209,"VICKI: But, Doctor, you might get "
210,"DOCTOR: I'm not going to argue, my child. "
211,"STEVEN: Yes, but. "
212,(The Doctor leaves) 
213,"STEVEN: Oh, heck. "
214,VICKI: You might try being a bit more tactful in future 
215,"STEVEN: Don't you start as well, come on, let's go up. "
216,"VICKI: No, I think we should stay here and wait for him like the Doctor"
217,said. 
218,STEVEN: Why? We've got to go up there sooner or later. It might as well
219,"be sooner. We can walk along the top and meet. Hey, that bit there"
220,looks climbable. Come on. 
221,VICKI: I'm not 
222,VICKI + STEVEN: very good on heights! 
223,"STEVEN: Oh, come on, you'll be all right. "
224,"(Vicki and Steven leaves, and the Monk examines the Tardis, then"
225,smiles)
226,
227,[Hut]
228,
229," (As evening falls, the Doctor enters the village"
230,"and goes into Wolnoth's hut. He picks up a dead fox, then tests a"
231,longbow. A dog or wolf howls and he goes outside. Someone uses a forked
232,stick to pin him to the wall)
233,
234, [Monastery]
235,
236,(Owls are hooting as the Monk unlocks the main door
237,and bars it behind him. After a few moments a light shines out of an
238,"upper window then we hear monks chanting, presumably Vespers.)"
239,
240, [Clifftop]
241,
242,(The tide has come right in now) 
243,"ELDRED: Yes, it was on the beach, below us here. "
244,WULNOTH: Are you certain? 
245,"ELDRED: Yes, positive. I remember the way the rocks look. "
246,"WULNOTH: Pity, it might have been valuable. "
247,"ELDRED: It would have been crushed against the rocks by now, whatever"
248,it was.
249,
250,[Village]
251,
252,(A horn of drink is poured and taken outside. The
253,monks can be heard here too) 
254,"DOCTOR: Oh, what's this? "
255,EDITH: Mead. 
256,"DOCTOR: Mead? Oh, mead. Yes, of course, yes. Yes, how nice of you, yes."
257,"Delightful, thank you, thank you. Well, here's to your very good"
258,health. 
259,(The Doctor drinks.) 
260,"DOCTOR: Oh, delightful. Oh, yes, delightful. Tell me, is the monastery"
261,near here? 
262,"EDITH: No, it's not far from here. It's just at the top of the hill."
263,"And when the winds in the right direction, you can hear the monks much"
264,"clearer, as though they're down in the village. "
265,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, quite understandable, you know."
266,Sounds do play funny tricks at times. 
267,"EDITH: I, er, I hope you will forgive a woman's harsh welcome. We do"
268,fear strangers but we're very happy to welcome a traveller. Not that we
269,"see many in this wild place. I'm sure that when my husband returns,"
270,he'll insist that you stay the night. And then you can rejoin your
271,friends in the morning. 
272,"DOCTOR: Well, that's very kind, very kind indeed. And I do hope they"
273,"won't worry about me too much. You know, I hadn't intended to walk"
274,quite so far. You are near the coast? 
275,"EDITH: Yes. While there are fish in the sea, one need never starve. "
276,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes. "
277,"EDITH: Course, there are bad things, too. "
278,"DOCTOR: Oh, of course, of course, my dear. The Vikings, for example? "
279,"EDITH: Not that we've seen much of them, this year. Except for that one"
280,raid that was beaten off just north of here. 
281,"DOCTOR: Yes, I had heard about that battle, yes, yes. The King, er,"
282,greatly improved the position no end. 
283,EDITH: The King? Harold Godwinson? We received no help from him. 
284,"DOCTOR: You know, it seems like yesterday that the good King Edward was"
285,laid to rest. When was it? 
286,EDITH: It was the beginning of the year. 
287,"DOCTOR: Oh, of course. Yes, yes, yes, the beginning of the year, yes,"
288,"yes, yes. How silly. Yes, it's most refreshing. "
289,"EDITH: Oh, I'll get you more. "
290,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. Yes, thank you, my dear. "
291,(Edith goes into the hut) 
292,"DOCTOR: Now, if Harold is king, and Edward was laid to rest at the"
293,"beginning of the year, then it must be 1066! Yes. Judging by the"
294,"appearance of these leaves, late summer. And a balmy night, a balmy"
295,night. 
296,(Edith returns) 
297,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you, my dear. Thank you, thank you. Er, you know,"
298,"it's a bit stupid of me but, we are in Northumbria? "
299,"EDITH: Yes, of course, we are. Why do you ask? "
300,"DOCTOR: Oh, nothing, nothing, I just that I wasn't sure whether I'd"
301,"crossed the border or not. Yes, it's a bit tedious of me, isn't it? But"
302,you must have patience with an old man. 
303,"EDITH: Oh, please, sit down and rest before the fire. You must be tired"
304,"after your journey. Forgive me, I have things to do before Wulnoth"
305,returns. 
306,"DOCTOR: I will, I will, and thank you indeed. Thank you. Yes, it's a"
307,"great pity that Barbara isn't here. Now, if my memory of English"
308,"history serves me right, we're about to have a Viking invasion and very"
309,"soon. Now, let me think. Harold came north to defeat Hardrada, the"
310,"Norwegian King. Yes, now that was before he faced William the Conqueror"
311,"at Hastings. It's all very interesting. Yes, that's very, very, very,"
312,very interesting. It's going to put that young man in his place. 
313,(The chanting slows down then suddenly gets back up to speed again) 
314,DOCTOR: Woman! Woman! Where are you? 
315,EDITH: What? What is it? 
316,"DOCTOR: The monastery. Where is it, did you say? "
317,"EDITH: Well, at the top of the hill. Why? What's the matter? "
318,"DOCTOR: The monks, have they been here long? "
319,"EDITH: No, the monastery itself's been deserted for years and years and"
320,"then, several weeks ago, a few monks must have moved back in. "
321,DOCTOR: And you haven't seen them? No one in the village has? 
322,"EDITH: One's been seen, but never spoken to. How does he know that? "
323,"DOCTOR: Oh, you've been very kind, and a great help, yes. I'm sorry,"
324,but I must take my leave of you. 
325,EDITH: Are you going to the monastery? 
326,DOCTOR: I most certainly am. 
327, [Forest]
328,
329," STEVEN: Look, are you coming? "
330,VICKI: Can't we rest a minute? 
331,STEVEN: We just did. 
332,"VICKI: Well, I'm tired. "
333,"STEVEN: Oh, well, we'll wait a little while. But we're lost. We can't"
334,stay here all night. 
335,(a twig snaps) 
336,VICKI: Shh! 
337,STEVEN: What's the matter? 
338,VICKI: I think somebody's coming. 
339,STEVEN: Why are we hiding? We can ask him the way. 
340,VICKI: No. Because I think we should follow him until we find out
341,whether it's safe or not. 
342,STEVEN: Oh. 
343,VICKI: Supposing you do what I say for once? 
344,(It's a villager with a rabbit for the pot. He stops and picks
345,something up from the ground) 
346,VICKI: He's found something. 
347,STEVEN: What is it? 
348,VICKI: I can't see. 
349,STEVEN: Did you drop something? Hey! You! 
350,(The villager runs off) 
351,STEVEN: Hey! Come back! 
352,VICKI: Steven! 
353,"(Steven catches the villager)  VICKI: Steven, I. Leave him"
354,"alone! Stop it! Stop it, Steven! "
355,(Steven lets go and the villager runs off) 
356,VICKI: You all right? 
357,"STEVEN: Yes, I think so. I got it. "
358,VICKI: What was it? 
359,"(A wrist watch with an expanding bracelet, and the time is 11.50) "
360,STEVEN: You still say this is tenth century England?
361,
362,[Monastery door]
363,
364,(The Doctor arrives at the monastery and tries the
365,"door, but it is still bolted. He steps back, and the door is unbolted"
366,from the inside. It swings open.)
367,
368,[Monastery entrance]
369,
370,(The Doctor enters. He explores the complex and
371,discovers an old fashioned horned gramophone playing in an alcove. He
372,"stops the chanting. Then a wooden grill comes down, trapping him there."
373,The Monk comes up and laughs in his face.)
374,
375, Episode Two - The
376,Meddling Monk 
377,[Monastery Kitchen]
378,
379," (Next morning, the Monk is making breakfast with"
380,an electronic toaster and a camping stove. He puts fried eggs and toast
381,onto a plate on a tray along with a china tea cup and heads off through
382,the monastery.)
383,
384,[Cell]
385,
386,(The Monk quietly opens the door and slides the
387,tray inside before locking up again then MONK: Breakfast! Breakfast!
388,"Come along. Early to bed, early to rise! Come on. Do you want the eggs"
389,to get cold? 
390,(The cup of tea is thrown in his face.) 
391,DOCTOR : Go away! I'll come out when I'm ready.
392,
393,[Forest]
394,
395,(The villagers spot the sleeping travellers.) 
396,"VICKI: Steven? Steven? Oh, Steven! "
397,STEVEN: Morning. What are you looking so jittery about? 
398,VICKI: I thought I heard somebody moving about in the bushes. 
399,STEVEN: That was me. I was looking for some food. 
400,VICKI: Did you find anything? 
401,STEVEN: That's a matter of opinion. Want some breakfast? 
402,"VICKI: Yes, please. "
403,"STEVEN: Well, you can either have some blackberries or some"
404,blackberries. 
405,"VICKI: I don't think it matters, thanks. Oh, I�m freezing. "
406,STEVEN: Mmm. We'd better get moving then. 
407,"VICKI: What, back to the Tardis? "
408,"STEVEN: Yes. If the Doctor's not there, we'll have to think again. "
409,VICKI: I wonder what time it is. 
410,(Steven shows her the watch on his wrist) 
411,STEVEN: Twenty past five. 
412,VICKI: I wonder if the Doctor did drop that. 
413,STEVEN: You said before he didn't have a watch. 
414,VICKI: I said I didn't think he had. 
415,"STEVEN: Oh, why don't you admit all this tenth century stuff's just "
416,(A twig snaps and Steven goes to investigate.) 
417,VICKI: There's somebody there. Steven? Steven? 
418,(Eldred grabs Vicki and puts a knife to her throat while two others
419,jump Steven.) 
420,ELDRED: What shall we do with them? 
421,WULNOTH: Take them to the village.
422,
423, [Outside the Monastery]
424,
425,"(The Monk comes out, and looks at his wrist. Is he"
426,"missing a watch? He goes up to the ridge, but hurries down and sits"
427,reading a scroll when ) 
428,"EDITH: Good morning, Father. "
429,"MONK: Ah, good morning, my children. Good morning. Oh, so deep was I in"
430,"my meditations, I failed to see you arrive. You must forgive me. "
431,"EDITH: Oh, no, it is we who should ask forgiveness of you, disturbing"
432,you like this. 
433,"MONK: No please, please. You're always welcome here. "
434,"EDITH: We, er, we thought you might need some food. "
435,"MONK: Ah, how very charitable of you, my dear. "
436,"EDITH: Oh, I'm sorry Father, it's poor fare for the likes of you. "
437,"MONK: Yes, but don't distress yourself, my child. We must all be"

606,have. 
607,"STEVEN: Oh, now, what does that mean? "
608,"VICKI: Well look, say he's the one who's tricked us. Say he gave"

771,EDITH: Plans of a Viking invasion? 
772,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I'm afraid so. "

887,"convert this ridiculous thing into miles. Absurd measurement, miles,"

889,(He marks a map and makes notes when there's a banging on the door)

899,"one there. But as soon as he goes back in and bars the door, someone"
900,"knocks again. The Monk looks around, and the Doctor comes up behind him"
901,and jabs a branch into his back. They go inside the monastery)

909,DOCTOR: Proceed. 
910,(They walk on a little way) 
911,DOCTOR: Wait. 
912,"MONK: I thought I'd seen the last of you, Doctor. "
913,"DOCTOR: Oh, did you now? Well, as it happens, I happen to be a very"
914,"curious fellow. Yes, very curious. Now then, I have some questions for"
915,you and I want them answered. Continue.

917,[Clifftop]
918,
919, VICKI: It was somewhere about here. 
920,STEVEN: I can't tell for certain but I think this is an easy way down. 
921,"VICKI: The tide. Steven, the tide's come in. "
922,"STEVEN: Yes, well, it usually does. "
923,"VICKI: Yes, but the Tardis was down there. Oh, no. The tide. Nobody"
924,thought of that. 
925,"STEVEN: Well, it's a bit late to think of it now. "
926,"VICKI: Yes, but what shall we do? "
927,"STEVEN: Look, if the Doctor came back here, he'd have moved it. He"
928,wouldn't have left it on the beach. 
929,VICKI: The only way the Doctor could move the Tardis would be to
930,dematerialise. 
931,STEVEN: So? 
932,"VICKI: If the Doctor left here in the Tardis, he couldn't get back. Oh,"
933,"it can't be that, it can't be! "
934,"STEVEN: Look, there's no point in us sitting here. I think we should go"
935,back to the monastery. 
936,VICKI: The monastery. What's the point of that now? 
937,STEVEN: At least we'd be doing something practical. Whatever's happened
938,"down there, it has happened. There's no point in moping about it. "
939,VICKI: I'm not moping. You don't know what the Tardis meant. 
940,STEVEN: Come on. 
941,(Steven spots a device hidden in the shrubs) 
942,"STEVEN: What's this? Vicki, come and take a look at this. "
943,VICKI: What? 
944,STEVEN: Just come and look! What do you make of that? 
945,VICKI: It's a gun of sorts. 
946,"STEVEN: Trained out to sea, hidden by the bushes. Look, in Saxon times,"
947,"they used swords and bows and arrows, not things like this, didn't"
948,they? 
949,"VICKI: Yes, you're right. "
950,"STEVEN: The Monk, it must be. You still say there's no point in going"
951,back to the monastery? Come on.
952,
953,[Corridor]
954,
955," DOCTOR: All right, that will do. You know, I"
956,believe we've come through this corridor twice already. It's no use you
957,"playing for time, you know. I want some answers! "
958,(The Monk tries to make a grab for the 'gun') 
959,"DOCTOR: Ah ha! Now, I wouldn't do that if I were you. This may not be a"
960,gun but I can still do you a considerable amount of harm. 
961,"MONK: Oh, a man of violence. I'm surprised at you. "
962,DOCTOR: Never mind about all that. What is it you're doing here? What
963,are you up to? 
964,(Banging at the door.) 
965,MONK: The door. I must go. 
966,"DOCTOR: Just leave that, shall we? "
967,"MONK: But if I don't go, they'll get suspicious. "
968,"DOCTOR: Then we'll both go. I'll open the door, then I can keep an eye"
969,on you. 
970,"MONK: You open the door? No, Doctor, that's not a very good idea. "
971,"DOCTOR: Oh, isn't it? Why not? "
972,MONK: Because you're not wearing the right sort of clothes. 
973,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, I see, I see. First, you want to open the door, then"
974,you want the chance to reverse the position with the help of whoever it
975,"is outside? Secondly, you want to get me into a monk's habit so that"
976,"whoever that is, would recognise me as an imposter. "
977,"MONK: Dear me, dear me, what an untrusting nature you have, my son. "
978,"DOCTOR: Yes, and you can drop the monk's act. "
979,"MONK: I'm only trying to help. Whoever it is, it's probably as"
980,"traveller knocking for shelter. Who else could it be? Doctor, I must"
981,"remind you this is a monastery, a place of refuge, sanctuary. "
982,"DOCTOR: Yes, very well, if you have another cloak with the same type of"
983,cowl? Proceed. 
984,MONK: Of course.

1042,husband. 
1043,EDITH: Yes. 
1044,WULNOTH: Is anything wrong with Eldred? 
1045,"MONK: No, no, no. Eldred is splendid. No, Wulnoth, I've come here to"
1046,ask for your help and that of the men of the village. 
1047,"WULNOTH: Oh, we'll help if we can, Father. "
1048,"MONK: Oh, you can, Wulnoth, you most certainly can. I'd have come here"
1049,a bit later but it seems I'm going to be rather busy up at the
1050,monastery. 
1051,WULNOTH: What is it that you want us to do? 
1052,MONK: Prepare beacon fires on the cliff tops. 
1053,WULNOTH: Beacon fires? 
1054,"MONK: Oh, don't worry, don't worry, Wulnoth. I'm expecting some"
1055,building materials for reconstructing the monastery. They're coming by
1056,sea and I promised I'd give the ship our exact location. 
1057,"WULNOTH: Well, when are you expecting the ship? It'll take a little"
1058,while to prepare a beacon. 
1059,"MONK: In a day or two, maybe three. Now, Wulnoth, you will light the"
1060,"fires when I ask, won't you, and keep them burning? "
1061,"WULNOTH: If you say so, Father. "
1062,MONK: Splendid. Splendid. Now I must go back to the monastery. Eldred
1063,"needs rather special care. Good day, my children. "

1108,
1109, DOCTOR: I repeat my question. Which fires and what
1110,are they for? 
1111,"MONK: All right, then. They're a signal for King Hardrada and the"
1112,Viking fleet. 
1113,DOCTOR: I see. 
1114,"MONK: They'll think it's a landing place. They'll come in unsuspecting,"
1115,and then 
1116,DOCTOR: Well? Out with it! 
1117,MONK: I'm going to destroy them!

1120,
1121," STEVEN: Hey, Vicki. Come take a look at this. He's"
1122,got a sort of fantastic private collection. 
1123,"(Furniture, statues, artwork, objet d'art) "
1124,VICKI: He's got something from every period and every place. 
1125,"STEVEN: Hey, come and take a look at this. "
1126,(A mortar bomb type weapon. Vicki has found a journal.) 
1127,"STEVEN: It looks like some kind of neutron bomb, I think. "
1128,"VICKI: Pretty unpleasant looking things, whatever they are. "
1129,"STEVEN: Hey, you know these could be fired by that weapon we saw on the"
1130,clifftop. I wonder what he wants to do? Sink a ship? 
1131,"VICKI: He could sink a whole navy with that lot, I should think. "
1132,"STEVEN: Yes, but the point is, why would he want to? "
1133,VICKI: Why has he done a lot of things? Listen to this. 
1134,STEVEN: Why? What have you got there? 
1135,VICKI: A logbook. A sort of diary. Listen. Met Leonardo Da Vinci. 
1136,STEVEN: Who? 
1137,VICKI: Da Vinci. Listen! Met Leonardo Da Vinci and discussed with him
1138,the principles of powered flight. 
1139,STEVEN: What? Da Vinci lived in the middle ages. I know he tried to
1140,"build a flying machine, a sort of aeroplane. "
1141,VICKI: I know and according to this it was the Monk who put him up to
1142,it. And listen to this; Put two hundred pounds in a London bank in
1143,1968. Nipped forward two hundred years and collected a fortune in
1144,"compound interest. (This is, of course, impossible)"
1145,
1146, [Corridor]
1147,
1148, DOCTOR: So that's it! You're a time meddler! No
1149,wonder you wanted to get rid of me. And what are you trying to get up
1150,to this time? 
1151,"MONK: I'm sure you'll approve, Doctor. "
1152,DOCTOR: Are you quite mad? You know as well as I do the golden rule
1153,"about space and time travelling. Never, never interfere with the course"
1154,of history. 
1155,"MONK: And who says so? Doctor, it's more fun my way. I can make things"
1156,happen ahead of their time. 
1157,DOCTOR: Is that so? 
1158,"MONK: Yes, indeed. For instance, do you really believe the ancient"
1159,Britons could have built Stonehenge without the aid of my
1160,anti-gravitational lift? 
1161,DOCTOR: And what mischief are you up to now? 
1162,"MONK: Mischief? No, no. A master plan. A master plan to end all master"
1163,plans. 
1164,"DOCTOR: Oh, is that so? "
1165,MONK: The whole course of history changed in one single swoop. 
1166,DOCTOR: By wiping out the Viking fleet? 
1167,"MONK: Exactly, Doctor, exactly. Of course, obviously, I don't have to"
1168,remind you that the main reason William the Conqueror won the Battle of
1169,"Hastings, was because King Harold had to march to Stamford Bridge and"
1170,defeat the Vikings first. 
1171,DOCTOR: So you plan to save him the journey? 
1172,"MONK: That's right. Precisely. A fresh army, no desertions. Why King"
1173,Harold will kick William back to Normandy before knows what happened.
1174,"It's quite a plan, eh? "
1175,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, it's quite a plan. It's quite a plan, yes. I count"
1176,"myself a very fortunate person indeed, to be here, in time to prevent"
1177,this disgusting exhibition! 
1178,"MONK: You haven't prevented it yet, Doctor. "
1179,DOCTOR: Haven't I? Where is this machine? 
1180,MONK: I don't allow anybody in there. 
1181,DOCTOR: Where is it? 
1182,"MONK: This way, Doctor. "

1186,ELDRED: Vikings!
1187,(Sven finds Ulf and unties him) 
1188,ULF: Where've you been? 
1189,"SVEN: The Monk tricked me into a cell, then knocked me out. "
1190,ULF: Can't you even guard one old man? 
1191,SVEN: You haven't done better yourself. Come on. We should get back to
1192,the forest. 
1193,"ULF: No, we'll stay here. "
1194,SVEN: Here? 
1195,ULF: Safer than being outside. Unless you prefer to meet the Saxons
1196,again. 
1197,SVEN: They wouldn't take us so easily this time. Nor would we be
1198,hampered by the mead. 
1199,ULF: Maybe not. But I'll choose the monks and whatever treasure may be
1200,stored inside these walls. 
1201,SVEN: Treasure.

1203,[Chapel]
1204,
1205," MONK: Oh. Well, here we are. That's my time ship. "
1206,"DOCTOR: Oh, so that's it, eh? This horrible block of stone. "
1207,"MONK: This horrible block of stone, as you call it, is a perfect Saxon"
1208,sarcophagus. 
1209,DOCTOR: A Saxon what? 
1210,MONK: Sarcophagus. 
1211,"DOCTOR: Yes, quite so. "
1212,"MONK: And more in keeping with the period, I would say, than a modern"
1213,"police box? What's the matter, Doctor? Can't you repair your camouflage"
1214,unit? 
1215,"DOCTOR: Now, now, now, don't try and bamboozle me. It so happens that"
1216,"your machine fits into this monastery, but it's sheer luck. "
1217,"MONK: Luck? Luck? Oh, no, there's no luck about it. I couldn't have"
1218,picked a better place for my headquarters than this. A deserted
1219,"monastery right on the coast, gullible peasants who believe everything"
1220,"I say to them. No, Doctor. No, I planned to materialise my ship right"
1221,"on this very spot disguised as a sarcophagus, and here it is. "
1222,DOCTOR: I see. And all this is part of your master plan? 
1223,MONK: Precisely! There's nothing hit or miss about my machine. 
1224,"DOCTOR: Oh, isn't there now? Well, let's have a look at this great"
1225,"wonder. Yes, well, tell me, how does one exactly get into this"
1226,sarcophagus? Hammer and chisel?

1235,"VICKI: Why, Steven? Why is he planning to do it? What's his reason? "
1236,"DOCTOR: That's a very good point, my child, indeed, a very good point."
1237,I must ask him that myself. 
1238,VICKI: Doctor! You're safe! 
1239,DOCTOR: Safe? 
1240,"STEVEN: Oh, are we glad to see you, Doctor. "
1241,"DOCTOR: Safe? Oh, my dear, of course I'm safe. Good gracious me. I see"
1242,"you found the machine. Keep your eye on that, young man. I thought I'd"
1243,told you to wait outside the Tardis. 
1244,"VICKI: Oh, er, we "
1245,"STEVEN: Yes, well, we, er "
1246,"DOCTOR: You know, all this is very surprising. That's a Mark 4! "
1247,"MONK: Yes, yes, indeed. "
1248,"VICKI: Is that later than yours, Doctor? "
1249,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
1250,VICKI: Oh! I forgot all about it. 
1251,"DOCTOR: Oh? Forgot? Forgot what, child? "
1252,VICKI: Doctor. Doctor. 
1253,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
1254,VICKI: We haven't got a time machine any more. 
1255,"DOCTOR: Haven't we now? Oh, I say. Well, I wonder what that's supposed"
1256,to mean? 
1257,"VICKI: Well, you know, you know we left it on the beach. "
1258,"DOCTOR: Yes, I remember very well, yes. It so happens that I was there"
1259,"at the time. My dear, I may appear a little half witted at times, but I"
1260,
1261,VICKI: Doctor! 
1262,DOCTOR: Oh! 
1263,VICKI: The tide came in. 
1264,"DOCTOR: Oh, is that all, my child. "
1265,"STEVEN: Well, isn't that enough? "
1266,DOCTOR: The water cannot affect the Tardis. It won't wash away. It'll
1267,"still be there when the tide goes down. Now stop fretting, my dear."
1268,"Well, I must confess, er, I do congratulate you. It's a splendid"
1269,machine. Although I do note there's been quite a few changes? 
1270,"MONK: Oh, yes, indeed, Doctor. In fact this one is fitted with the"
1271,automatic drift control. 
1272,"DOCTOR: Oh, I see, yes, of course. And, er, thereby you can suspend"
1273,yourself in space with absolute safety. 
1274,"MONK: Precisely, Doctor. By the way, I tried to get into your police"
1275,"box but the door was locked. What type's yours, Doctor? "
1276,DOCTOR: Mind your own business. 
1277,"STEVEN: Look, I take it you both come from the same place, Doctor? "
1278,"DOCTOR: Yes, I regret that we do, but I would say that I am fifty years"
1279,earlier. Now when are you going to answer my questions? 
1280,MONK: Which questions? 
1281,DOCTOR: The reason for this deliberate destruction. 
1282,"MONK: I, I want to improve things. "
1283,"DOCTOR: Improve things? Improve things, yes, that's good. Very good."
1284,"Improve what, for instance? "
1285,"MONK: Well, for instance, Harold, King Harold, I know he'd be a good"
1286,"king. There wouldn't be all those wars in Europe, those claims over"
1287,France went on for years and years. With peace the people'd be able to
1288,better themselves. With a few hints and tips from me they'd be able to
1289,have jet airliners by 1320! Shakespeare'd be able to put Hamlet on
1290,television. 
1291,DOCTOR: He'd do what? 
1292,MONK: The play Hamlet on television. 
1293,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, quite so, yes, of course, I do know the medium. "
1294,STEVEN: Were you going to kill the Vikings? 
1295,"MONK: Yes, yes, I was. You see, if I didn't, then King "
1296,DOCTOR: What are we going to do with this fellow? What can we do with

1309,
1310, WULNOTH: The old man who journeyed here spoke of a
1311,Viking invasion descending on us. And the Monk asked us to light beacon
1312,fires on the clifftops. 
1313,EDITH: The old man spoke the truth. He had no reason to lie. 
1314,WULNOTH: Fires on the clifftops would guide the ships in to land.
1315,Viking ships! 
1316,EDITH: We know and respect the monastery as a place of worship. But
1317,what of a Viking spy who passes himself off as a monk? Look! Eldred! 
1318,ELDRED: The monastery 
1319,WULNOTH: What of it? What have you seen? 
1320,ELDRED: Vikings. There are Vikings hiding there. 
1321,EDITH: Is that enough? Do you need more proof? 
1322,"MEN: No, no. "
1323,WULNOTH: Arm yourselves! We know how to treat the raiders!
1324,
1325,[Corridor]
1326,
1327,(The Monk has Ulf and Sven carrying the ammunition
1328,box) 
1329,"MONK: Come along, come along, if we want to send signals to your ships,"
1330,"we mustn't delay like this, you know. "
1331,ULF: What are these things? 
1332,"MONK: They are, er, they're charms, my son, to guide your ships to"
1333,"sheltered waters. Come along. I know you don't understand, but believe"
1334,"me, your ships will know they're there! "
1335, [Chapel]
1336,
1337,(Our heroes have been bound hand and foot) 
1338,STEVEN: I can't find a sharp enough stone anywhere. Those Vikings sure
1339,know how to tie knots. 
1340,VICKI: It looks as though that Monk's going to get away with it after
1341,all. 
1342,"STEVEN: Yes, but he can't, can he? I don't know much about history but"
1343,I do know that William the Conqueror did win the Battle of Hastings. 
1344,"VICKI: Up till now he did. If the Monk changes it, I suppose our"
1345,memories will change as well. 
1346,STEVEN: What about the history books? 
1347,VICKI: That's all right. They're not written yet. They'll just write
1348,and print the new version. 
1349,"STEVEN: But that means that the exact minute, the exact second that he"
1350,"does it, every history book, every, well, the whole future of every"
1351,"year and time on Earth will change, just like that and nobody'll know"
1352,that it has? 
1353,VICKI: I suppose that's what I'm trying to say. 
1354,"STEVEN: Well, there's more to this time travelling than meets the eye."
1355,"What's the matter with the Doctor? He's not gone to sleep, has he? "
1356,"VICKI: Doctor, are you awake? "
1357,"DOCTOR: Wide awake, my dear. As a matter of fact, I was just turning"
1358,over in my mind what we're going to do with this Monk fellow. He won't
1359,listen. He's determined to have his own way. He's got to be stopped. He
1360,must be stopped!
1361,
1362,[Monastery Entrance]
1363,
1364," MONK: Come along, come along, come on. Yes, yes,"
1365,"they are rather heavy, aren't they, but they're a sort of special"
1366,"charm, you understand? "
1367,ULF: And where are we taking them? 
1368,"MONK: To the clifftop. Now come along. I won't be stopped. Hurry, I'll"
1369,open the door for you. There. Come.
1370,
1371,[Outside the Monastery]
1372,
1373,(Where they are confronted by the armed villagers
1374,and chased back inside. The Monk hides behind the doors then runs
1375,"outside, and everyone follows him)"
1376,
1377,[Chapel]
1378,
1379,(Edith unties the Doctor) 
1380,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, thank you. Thank you indeed. Oh, it's a good thing for"
1381,us that you decided to make a search. 
1382,"EDITH: Oh, without your help, we'd never have known the Monk was a"
1383,"Viking spy, would we? "
1384,"DOCTOR: Ah, yes, the Monk, now was he caught? "
1385,"EDITH: Now Wulnoth and the others will not let him escape, nor the two"
1386,Vikings that are with him. 
1387,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, no doubt they'll catch up with him and the rest of"
1388,"them. But, that Monk you know, still worries me. I think he's got some"
1389,tricks left up his sleeve. 
1390,EDITH: Where are you going to now? 
1391,"DOCTOR: Oh, we shall continue with our travels. "
1392,"EDITH: Oh, you must come back to the village with us before you go so"
1393,we can bid you farewell. 
1394,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, certainly, certainly, but we have one or two things to"
1395,"do here at the monastery first. But, we don't want to delay you. We'll"
1396,follow on. 
1397,(Edith leaves) 
1398,"DOCTOR: What a charming woman. Charming. Well now, you two, come along."
1399,We've got a lot to do. 
1400,"STEVEN: Well, such as what? "
1401,VICKI: Shall we go back to the Tardis? 
1402,"DOCTOR: You know we can't do that, my child, not until we stop this"
1403,time meddler. Have either of you got a pencil and paper on you? 
1404,VICKI: No. 
1405,"STEVEN: No, afraid not. "
1406,"DOCTOR: Well now, be a good fellow and go into the machine and try and"
1407,find one. 
1408,"STEVEN: Yes, okay, Doc. "
1409,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
1410,STEVEN: Tor. 
1411,VICKI: Who are you going to write to? 
1412,"DOCTOR: To the Monk, of course. Who else?"
1413,
1414,[Forest]
1415,
1416," MONK: Here. this way. Behind that tree there,"
1417,"there's an old well. We can hide there, quick! "
1418,"(He sends Ulf and Sven off one way, and goes the other) "
1419,SVEN: There's no well there! 
1420,ULF: Where's he gone? 
1421,(And they're surrounded)
1422,
1423,[The Monk's Tardis]
1424,
1425,(The Doctor finds a particular component in the
1426,"underside of the console, and gets a shock from it) "
1427,"DOCTOR: Oh! Mr. Taylor! Where are you with that string, dear boy? "
1428,STEVEN: Here you are Doctor. I found some. 
1429,"DOCTOR: Good gracious me, come along. "
1430,"VICKI: What's that thing under there, Doctor? "
1431,"DOCTOR: Now keep your nose out, my child, never mind. Did you hear what"
1432,I said? Keep your nose away. Do you want to get a shock? This is a very
1433,"dangerous business. Now keep still, all of you. Tie this in a knot. "
1434,(He ties the string onto the component) 
1435,"DOCTOR: Now, the vibrations. Ticklish. Get back, get back! Now, you"
1436,"two, go outside. I'll follow in a minute. "
1437,"VICKI: But Doctor, what exactly are you doing? "
1438,"DOCTOR: Don't, please, ask me questions. Go child! Outside! "
1439,"STEVEN: Well, what are you trying to do? "
1440,"(Steven gets a Look, and leaves, as the Doctor carefully plays out the"
1441,string.)
1442,
1443,[Chapel]
1444,
1445, VICKI: Is he coming out yet? 
1446,"STEVEN: Yes, yes, here he is. "
1447,"DOCTOR: Now, back. Elbow room, please. Now keep still. We're not out of"
1448,the wood yet. 
1449,(He carefully pulls on the string and out comes the chosen component) 
1450,"DOCTOR: Ah, there it is! I've done it, I've done it, I've done it. "
1451,"STEVEN: Well, nothing's happened, Doctor. "
1452,"DOCTOR: Hasn't it? Hasn't it, my dear boy? "
1453,"VICKI: Come on, aren't you going to tell us? "
1454,"DOCTOR: Yes, sometime, my dear, sometime. Here, put that in your"
1455,pocket. Quite safe. 
1456,(The Doctor puts a paper on top of the altar.)
1457,"VICKI: Oh, is that the letter you wrote. "
1458,"DOCTOR: Yes, and "
1459,VICKI: To the Monk. 
1460,"DOCTOR: Keep your hands off it, young lady. I don't want you nosing"
1461,"into peoples personal and private correspondence. Gracious me. Well, I"
1462,"think we've finished here. Now, lets go. "
1463,STEVEN: Back to the Tardis? 
1464,"DOCTOR: Yes, certainly, back to the Tardis. Yes, come along. "
1465,[Clifftop]
1466,
1467," DOCTOR: There it is, my dear. There's the Tardis."
1468,Safe and sound. Didn't I tell you so? 
1469,"VICKI: Oh, am I glad to see that old police box again. "
1470,"DOCTOR: Oh, glad indeed. Well, we must start climbing down the cliff"
1471,and get aboard as soon as we can. There's going to be an invasion
1472,shortly. 
1473,STEVEN: What? You mean any minute now the Viking fleet's going to sail
1474,past here? 
1475,"DOCTOR: Yes, my boy, yes. And history will be "
1476,DOCTOR + VICKI: Allowed to take its natural course. 
1477,"STEVEN: You know, I'm beginning to like the idea of being a crew member"
1478,on a time machine. 
1479,VICKI: A crew member? You'll be lucky. He's the crew. We're just the
1480,passengers. 
1481,"DOCTOR: Yes, and both very welcome ones, my dear. Come along, come"
1482,"along. Come on, come on. "
1483,STEVEN: It's a heck of a way down. Wish we had a pair of wings.
1484,
1485,[Monastery Entrance]
1486,
1487,"(The Monk runs in, breathless, and bars the door) "
1488,"MONK: Oh. Oh, I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. It's"
1489,ridiculous. 
1490,[Chapel]
1491,
1492,"MONK: Yes, I was right. They're gone. Well, I"
1493,suppose I'd better be on my way again too. 
1494,(He sees the letter on the altar) 
1495,"MONK: The Doctor. (reads) My dear fellow, I'm sure will you excuse me"
1496,"but I didn't want to say goodbye, as you are obviously going to be very"
1497,busy for some time. He's right there. Just in case you still idea's
1498,"about your master plan, I've taken precautions to stop your time"
1499,"meddling. How could he stop a Mark 4? Possibly one day in the future,"
1500,"when you've learnt your lesson, I shall return and release you. Release"
1501,"me? Ha! Me? Oh, the old fool. I wonder what he meant by release me?"
1502,"Well, I'll be going. "
1503,(But he can't get in. His Tardis is now the size of the altar. It's no
1504,longer bigger inside than outside.) 
1505,MONK: Ah! Ah! What's he done? He's taken my dimensional control! He's
1506,"ruined my time machine! I'm, I'm marooned. Marooned! In 1066. Oh,"
1507,Doctor. Doctor! Doctor! 
1508,"(Down on the beach, the Tardis dematerialises."
