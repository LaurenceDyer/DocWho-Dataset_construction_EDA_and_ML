20," (Llanfairfach colliery has been closed, says the"
21,"notice on the gate, but underground a scared man is making his way"
22,along one of the worked out roadways. Welcome to post industrial
23,"Glamorgan, everyone.) "
24, [Outside Global Chemicals]
25,
26, (A white Range Rover drives through a crowd of
27,locals and into the Research Centre. Security keep the crowd back as a
28,man with a briefcase climbs out and is met by a middle management
29,type.) 
30,"ELGIN: Welcome back, sir. What's the news? "
31,STEVENS: All good. How long has this been going on? 
32,"ELGIN: Oh, since early this morning. They want to know what is going to"
33,happen. We all do. 
34,"STEVENS: In that case, I'll tell them. "
35,(Stevens steps onto the Range Rover's tail plate and addresses the
36,crowd.) 
37,STEVENS: I have in my hand a piece of paper which will mean a great
38,deal to all of you. Wealth in our time! 
39,(The crowd responds with derision. Meanwhile the frightened man in the
40,"mine has made it back to the lift, and starts up. He notices that the"
41,back of his right hand is glowing green.) 
42,STEVENS: When the National Coal Board were forced to close the pit last
43,year 
44,"MAN: It were a shame, that was. "
45,"STEVENS: No, my friends, we must not be bitter. We must face the facts."
46,Coal is a dying industry. 
47,MAN: Rubbish! Rubbish! 
48,STEVENS: Oil is our future now and the government agrees with me. They
49,"have not only given us the go-ahead for our plans, they have promised"
50,us money for future expansion! I have it here in black and white! 
51,(Cheers all round.) 
52,"STEVENS: Money for all of us! More jobs, more housing, more cars! "
53,"(The older folk cheer, but there is a group of long haired hippies off"
54,to the side.) 
55,JONES: More muck! More devastation! More death! 
56,MAN: Why don't you shut up and listen. 
57,STEVENS: Who is that? What did he say? 
58,ELGIN: It's that Professor Jones. He's a troublemaker. 
59,STEVENS: The Nobel prize winner? 
60,"ELGIN: Yes. Go easy, sir. He gets a lot of coverage in the press. "
61,"STEVENS: It seems there are some who do not agree with my vision, the"
62,future we hold in our hands. There are always those who resist
63,progress. 
64,JONES: Progress? Don't listen to him. He means fatter profits for
65,Global Chemicals. At the expense of your land! 
66,"MAN: Ah, shut your face. "
67,"JONES: The very air you breathe! Aye, and the health of you and your"
68,kids! 
69,EVANS: It's all right for you. You can afford to live the way you want
70,to. We need the jobs. 
71,"MILKMAN: Aye, we can't live on nuts, man. "
72,EVANS: We can't live on nuts. 
73,JONES: Can't you see you're being exploited? 
74,"MILKMAN: Ah, shut up! "
75,EVANS: Shut up or we'll shut you up. 
76,"STEVENS: No, wait, wait, my friends. Professor Jones is right. We must"
77,all share his concern. I assure you that I and my fellow directors 
78,(A siren sound fills the valley.) 
79,EVANS: It's the pit! 
80,MILKMAN: Oh no! 
81,MAN: It's the pit! 
82,"EVANS: Right, boys, come on! "
83,"(The men run to the old pit head, where the former miner is hanging on"
84,"to the siren handle, his skin all glowing green. He is most likely"
85,dead.)

89, (Jo is eating an apple at a table when the Doctor
90,comes out of the Tardis with a circuit module. Jo says something with
91,her mouth full.) 
92,DOCTOR: What? 
93,JO: Sorry. I said is that the dematerialisation circuit? 
94,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. No more trouble there, thank goodness. I can now take"
95,the Tardis wherever and whenever I like. I've got absolute control over
96,her. 
97,JO: Now that the Time Lords have forgiven you. 
98,"DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. "
99,"JO: What is it, then? "
100,"DOCTOR: What, this? "
101,JO: Mmm. 
102,"DOCTOR: Well, this is the space time coordinate programmer. The"
103,wretched thing's nearly worn out. That's the trouble with the Tardis.
104,"She's getting on a bit, you know, Jo. "
105,(Jo speaks again with her mouth full.) 
106,"DOCTOR: Look, must you? "
107,JO: I'm sorry. It's my breakfast. I said no wonder we never got to
108,Metebelis Three. 
109,"DOCTOR: There's precious little protein in an apple, you know. "
110,JO: Hmm? 
111,"DOCTOR: Protein's the thing for breakfast, Jo. "
112,"JO: Eggs and bacon, yuk. "
113,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's where we're going to next. "
114,JO: Where are we going? 
115,DOCTOR: Metebelis Three. The Tardis can't miss this time. I've actually
116,wired the coordinates into the programmer. 
117,(Jo is reading a newspaper and not listening.) 
118,"JO: Oh no! No, they can't! "
119,"DOCTOR: I can't wait to go there, you know, Jo. "
120,JO: It's criminal. Absolutely criminal.Â 
121,"DOCTOR: It must be a fascinating place. Just imagine it, a blue sun. "
122,JO: Listen. And at last the Ministry has given the green light to
123,Global Chemicals 
124,"DOCTOR: No, not a green light, it's a blue light. Everything's blue"
125,there. 
126,"JO: Common sense has triumphed at last. Well, don't they realise the"
127,pollution it will cause? 
128,"DOCTOR: Mmm, absolutely. "
129,JO: And the futile protests of Professor Jones 
130,"DOCTOR: You know, I might even get a hold of one of those famous blue"
131,"sapphires. Well, there you are. That should do it, I think. "
132,"JO: He won't give up, you know. A man like Professor Jones will never"
133,give up. 
134,DOCTOR: Where are you off to? 
135,JO: To pack a suitcase. 
136,"DOCTOR: Oh, good. Give me a couple of minutes and we'll be off. "
137,JO: Off? Off where? 
138,"DOCTOR: Well, Metebelis Three, of course. "
139,JO: I'm not going to Metebelis Three. 
140,DOCTOR: Why? Where are you thinking of going to? 
141,"JO: Well, South Wales, of course. Llanfairfach. "
142,"DOCTOR: Oh, Jo. "
143,"JO: You haven't been listening, have you? Honestly, Doctor, you "
144,DOCTOR + JO: never listen to a word I say!

146, [Engine house]
147,
148, (The dead man has been laid out respectfully.) 
149,"JONES: Well, what was he doing down the pit in the first place? "
150,EVANS: Monthly inspection. Best prop forward we ever had. What killed
151,"him? You're a doctor, Doctor Jones. "
152,"JONES: I'm not, you know. I'm a biologist. Some sort of gas maybe? "
153,"EVANS: But why has he turned green, man? "
154,JONES: I've no idea. Except 
155,EVANS: Expect what? 
156,"JONES: Well, that phosphorescent glow. It's almost like you get with"
157,putrefaction. 
158,EVANS: That's it then. 
159,"JONES: Well, no, after several weeks. He's been dead less than an hour."
160,
161, [UNIT Laboratory]
162,
163," DOCTOR: No, no, no! "
164,"BRIGADIER: But, Doctor, it's exactly your cup of tea. This fellow's"
165,"bright green apparently, and dead. "
166,"DOCTOR: Lethbridge Stewart, I'm not a policeman. Neither are you, for"
167,that matter. 
168,"BRIGADIER: Ah, but there are international implications, you see."
169,Possibility of sabotage at Global Chemicals. It's UNIT's duty to
170,protect them. My duty. 
171,"DOCTOR: Then do your duty, Brigadier. "
172,"BRIGADIER: But, Doctor, surely you must see the "
173,(Jo enters carrying a bag and wearing a white sheepskin trimmed coat.) 
174,"BRIGADIER: Ah, Miss Grant, I've a little job for you. I want you to "
175,"JO: I'm sorry, Brigadier, I can't. "
176,"BRIGADIER: Can't? Can I remind you, Miss Grant, that you are "
177,"JO: That I am a member of UNIT. Orders, court martials and all that."
178,"But unless you arrest me, I mean, unless you actually seize me and"
179,"fling me into a dungeon, I "
180,"DOCTOR: Ah, Jo, all ready? "
181,"JO: Oh dear. Doctor, I mean it. I'm going to go to South Wales because"
182,they have got to be stopped. 
183,BRIGADIER: Who's got to be stopped? 
184,"JO: Well, Global Chemicals, of course. Can't you see the harm this go"
185,ahead will do? 
186,"BRIGADIER: No, Miss Grant, I can't. Cheap petrol and lots of it."
187,Exactly what the world needs. 
188,"JO: No! No, look it's time to call a halt! It's time that the world"
189,awoke to the alarm bell of pollution instead of sliding down the
190,"slippery slopes of, of, of, whatever it is. "
191,DOCTOR: A very pretty mixed metaphor. 
192,"BRIGADIER: Yes, I seem to recognise the style. This fellow, Jones,"
193,"isn't it? The Nutcake Professor, isn't that what the papers call him? "
194,"JO: That doesn't make him wrong, does it. "
195,BRIGADIER: And you want to go down there to help him in his noble fight
196,"against the windmills, down to Llanfairfach. "
197,"JO: I'm sorry, Brigadier. I'm going to go even if it means resigning"
198,from UNIT. 
199,"BRIGADIER: Ah. Well, we can discuss that on the way down, can't we? "
200,JO: You mean 
201,"BRIGADIER: You will at least accept a lift, I trust? Yes, Miss Grant,"
202,"I'm going there too. Also the Doctor, I hope? "
203,DOCTOR: I'm going to Metebelis Three. 
204,"BRIGADIER: Wouldn't like to have to order you, Doctor. "
205,DOCTOR: I wouldn't advise you to try. 
206,"BRIGADIER: Yes. Ten minutes, Miss Grant. "
207,(The Brigadier leaves.) 
208,"DOCTOR: Metebelis Three, Jo? Where else would you like to go? You"
209,choose for yourself. 
210,JO: But I've only got ten minutes. 
211,"DOCTOR: Jo, you've got all the time in the world, and all the space."
212,I'm offering them to you. 
213,"JO: But, Doctor, don't you understand? I've got to go! This Professor"
214,"Jones, he's fighting for everything that's important, everything that"
215,"you've fought for. In a funny way, he reminds me of a sort of younger"
216,you. 
217,DOCTOR: I don't know whether to feel flattered or insulted. It's all
218,"right, Jo, I understand. "
219,"JO: Oh, Doctor! Thank you. "
220,DOCTOR: Jo? 
221,JO: Hmm? 
222,DOCTOR: Tell the Brigadier that I'll follow him down. 
223,JO: Right. 
224,DOCTOR: Later. 
225,JO: Right. Bye! 
226,DOCTOR: Goodbye. 
227,(Jo leaves.) 
228,DOCTOR: So the fledgling flies the coop. 
229,(The Doctor enters the Tardis and it dematerialises.)
230,
231, [Llanfairfach]
232,
233, (The Brigadier stops his natty white open top
234,Mercedes - BLC7B - by the milk float. He is not in uniform.) 
235,"BRIGADIER: Excuse me? Can you tell me the way to Global Chemicals,"
236,please? The research place? 
237,"MILKMAN: Well, if you don't turn off the straight road ahead, you can't"
238,"miss it, can you. It's just past the chapel on the hill, isn't it. "
239,"(Which is what Llanfairfach means, isn't it, look you, boyo.) "
240,JO: And the Wholeweal community? 
241,"MILKMAN: I beg your pardon, Miss? "
242,"JO: The Wholeweal? Oh, you know, Professor Jones. "
243,"MILKMAN: Oh, the Nuthutch. Well, you'll be passing the Nuthutch on the"
244,"mountain, won't you. "
245,"BRIGADIER: Right, thank you. "
246,"MILKMAN: You're welcome, boyo. "
247,JO: Boyo.
248,
249, [Wholeweal Community]
250,
251," (A psychedelic 60's style sign marks the place,"
252,which is a farm. A bullock watches Jo get out of the car.) 
253,JO: Thanks for the lift. 
254,"BRIGADIER: Not sure that I approve, Miss Grant. Duty is duty when all's"
255,said and done. 
256,JO: Well a girl's got to do what a girl's got to do. Sir. 
257,BRIGADIER: Mmm. 
258,JO: Bye! 
259,(Jo heads off to a sign saying Spore Store and Toadstools What's More.)
260,
261,"BRIGADIER: The Doctor's no better, gallivanting off on a pleasure jaunt"
262,at a time like this. 
263,(The Tardis materialises on a very blue planet. There is a screeching
264,sound and a long tentacle grabs him.)
265,
266, [Community house]
267,
268," (Jo opens the front door, making a bell ring.) "
269,JO: Hello? Hello? 
270,(She puts her bag down and reads the sign on a door.) 
271,"JO: Room for living. Hmm, like it. Anybody home? "
272,"(She tries the door opposite, labelled Watch It Toadstools Professors.)"
273,
274,JONES : Come in.
275,
276, [Jones' laboratory]
277,
278, (A man is half hidden in a wicker chair hanging
279,"from the ceiling. Very 60's, very Prisoner.) "
280,JONES: No one in. 
281,JO: You are. 
282,"JONES: Did my stint in the fields before breakfast, didn't I. "
283,"JO: Oh, I see. They're all out in the fields. "
284,"JONES: Aye, that's what I said. No work, no food. Logically,"
285,esthetically and morally right. Right? 
286,"JO: Right, I suppose. "
287,"JONES: Well, now, what. Shut the blasted door! Of all the silly young"
288,goats. 
289,(Jones checks a thermometer in a tray of fungi.) 
290,"JO: Oh, I'm sorry. What did I do? "
291,"JONES: Probably ruined a month's work, that's all. Can't you read? It"
292,"said on the door to watch it, didn't it? "
293,JO: Yes. 
294,JONES: Half a degree drop and 
295,"JO: Well, I. Ow! "
296,(Jo walks into the corner of the workbench.) 
297,JO: For goodness sakes. 
298,"JONES: No, no, no - not there, you'll have the lot over. Not there"
299,either. You'll contaminate my spores. 
300,"JO: Where can I go, for Pete's sake? "
301,"JONES: Well, just try standing still, my love, eh? Tell us the dreadful"
302,"news. You've come to join us, right? "
303,"JO: Well, yes, in a way. You see, I'm Jo Grant. I rang from London. I"
304,spoke to somebody who said her name was Mum. 
305,"JONES: Mum? Oh, our Nancy that is. Yeah, Nancy with a laughing face."
306,She didn't tell me. 
307,"JO: Well, why should she? You see, I've come to see Professor Jones,"
308,not you. 
309,JONES: Oh. 
310,JO: So if you could tell me where I could wait? 
311,(Jones ignores her so she leans on the desk next to him and knocks some
312,stuff onto the floor.) 
313,"JO: I said, if you could "
314,"JONES: Look. Look, Why not just have a stool over here. And careful,"
315,"now! Look, that's it. Just sit there and simmer down. All right? Right."
316,"There, we've got off on the wrong foot, haven't we. Still I suppose you"
317,"can't help being a bit cloth-headed. You're only a kid, after all. "
318,JO: Charming. 
319,"JONES: Hey, welcome to the Nuthutch! "
320,JO: Huh! 
321,"(Meanwhile, jacket torn and face dirty, the Doctor is running for his"
322,life from loud and unfriendly creatures. The Professor continues to do
323,calculations at his desk.) 
324,JONES: Do you know anything about entomology? 
325,JO: Insects? 
326,JONES: Mmm. 
327,"JO: Yes, a little.Â "
328,"JONES: Right. What's got twenty legs, a yellow body about two inches"
329,long and big red pincers on the front end? 
330,JO: Hmm. Don't know. Why? 
331,JONES: There's one crawling up your left leg. 
332,JO: Argh! There's nothing there. 
333,"JONES: No, I couldn't stand the silence any longer. "
334,(The Doctor is climbing a rock face as snow settles on him.) 
335,JO: But why toadstools? 
336,"JONES: Oh, that's just our Nancy's little joke. "
337,"JONES: This is really our new hybrid fungus, Saliota Orbis. "
338,(It has a red and white cap.) 
339,JO: Pardon? 
340,JONES: It's a sort of cousin of the mushroom you can buy in the shops. 
341,JO: You mean you can eat it? 
342,"JONES: Oh yes, that's the whole point. Well, the world's going to need"
343,something instead of meat. High protein fungus can be just the answer. 
344,"JO: Well, yes. Yes, of course! "
345,"JONES: You see, Jo, we haven't set up this community just to drop out."
346,"I mean, let's face it, who does like the petrol stinking, plastic"
347,"rat-trap life we all live? No, no. If we're going to make a success"
348,"here at Wholeweal, we've got to do something that's going to help the"
349,entire world. So we're a biotechnic research unit as well as a
350,Nuthutch. 
351,"JO: But that's marvellous! Did he think of that? The Professor, I mean?"
352,
353,"JONES: Well, I could never have got it off the ground without the Nobel"
354,prize money. 
355,JO: But (the penny drops) Are you Professor Jones? 
356,"JONES: Your obedient servant, ma'am. "
357, [Stevens' office]
358,
359, STEVENS: We've sunk a great deal of time and money
360,"into this new project, and we're not going to stand by and see it"
361,"wasted. Now your job, Brigadier, is "
362,"BRIGADIER: Oh, forgive me, sir, but I know quite well what my job is."
363,"We'll look after you, never fear. "
364,STEVENS: I beg your pardon. I had no intention of 
365,"BRIGADIER: Equally, I'm quite certain also that it's my job to find out"
366,about this man's death. Events like that are the very reason UNIT was
367,created. 
368,STEVENS: I see. What do you intend to do? 
369,BRIGADIER: Get hold of the Doctor at once. May I use your phone? 
370,"STEVENS: Yes, of course. Elgin, get an outside line, will you? "
371,ELGIN: Sir. 
372,(The Doctor has climbed up to a ledge where there is a crop of huge
373,sapphires. The telephone rings in the UNIT laboratory. Something with
374,large wings approaches in the blue gloom and the Doctor ducks out of
375,the way of talons a good metre or so across. The telephone stops
376,ringing.) 
377,"BRIGADIER: (into phone) I see. All right, keep trying and ring me here"
378,"as soon as you do get an answer, understood? Yes. Right, goodbye."
379,"Mister Stevens, I wonder if you'd explain to me exactly why Professor"
380,Jones and his friends should object to your new process? 
381,"STEVENS: I wish I could tell you. After all, he and the rest of the"
382,doom merchants never stop telling us that we're using up the world's
383,supply of oil. We can now produce twenty five percent more petrol and
384,diesel fuel from a given quantity of crude oil. If that isn't
385,"conservation, I don't know what is."
386,
387, [Jones' laboratory]
388,
389, JONES: But it's still using up the oil and
390,"doubling the atmospheric pollution. No, the world has got to find ways"
391,of using the energy the sun is giving us now. 
392,"JO: Well, like what, for instance? "
393,"JONES: Well, like using the movement of the wind and the tides and the"
394,"rivers. Well, I mean, like here at the Nuthutch. Well, you are quite"
395,warm? 
396,"JO: The ambient temperature suits me fine, thank you. "
397,JONES: Heat from the river. And the heat pump works on electricity
398,"generated by a windmill. Alternative technology, see. "
399,"JO: And no waste, no pollution! "
400,JONES: Exactly.
401,
402, [Stevens' office]
403,
404, BRIGADIER: No waste? No pollution from an oil
405,refinery? 
406,STEVENS: Minimal. Negligible. 
407,"BRIGADIER: Well, I'm no scientist, Mister Stevens, but I find that"
408,somewhat difficult to believe. 
409,"ELGIN: Oh, it's been one of our strongest selling points. It makes"
410,"nonsense of the objections. We've been able, in all sincerity, to"
411,"assure the government, the people, indeed the world, that the Stevens"
412,process is clean.
413,
414, [Jones' laboratory]
415,
416, JONES: The Steven's process must be based on
417,"Bateson's polymerisation, and that means thousands of gallons of waste."
418,"Aye, a thick sludge you can't break down in any way, like a liquid"
419,"plastic. And what properties that would have, heaven alone knows. "
420,JO: And you're wondering what they're going to do with it? 
421,JONES: I wondering what they're doing with it now. And I can't help
422,thinking that there must be some connection with Hughes' death. 
423,JO: You mean they're pumping the waste down into the old mine workings?
424,
425,"JONES: Aye, could be. "
426,"JO: Well then, let's go and have a look. "
427,"JONES: Oh, that's a good idea. "
428,"JO: I mean, I mean like now. "
429,"JONES: My dear good child, I've got work to do. "
430,JO: You're being patronising. 
431,"JONES: Aye, so I am. But I've still got work to do. "
432,JO: Oh! 
433,JONES: Shut the door! 
434,(Jo slams the door on her way out.)
435,
436, [Pithead office]
437,
438," (The former miners are still at the colliery,"
439,drinking tea.) 
440,"EVANS: It's plain stupid, man. Here we are, sitting about nattering"
441,"like the women after chapel, and we still don't know what killed him. "
442,BERT: Finding out won't do him any good now. 
443,"EVANS: No, but it'll do me a lot of good, though, all this waiting. "
444,"DAVE: Ah, well, it could be dangerous, man. "

448,it scares me now? 
449,"BERT: Oh, why bother? "
450,"DAVE: Aye, don't panic, man. "
451,EVANS: I'm going down.
452,
453, [Stevens' office]
454,
455," STEVENS: Therefore, I think it imperative that"
456,nobody should go down the mine. It must be sealed off completely. 
457,"BRIGADIER: I'm afraid I must disagree, sir. Indeed, I intend to make"
458,the investigation of that mine my first priority as soon as the Doctor
459,arrives. 
460,STEVENS: If he ever does arrive. 
461,(The Doctor is running back to the Tardis as large things throw rocks
462,at him. He gets inside just as spears hit the door.)

482,STEVENS: Do you still intend to go investigate the mine? 
483,BRIGADIER: Indeed I do. 
484,(The Brigadier leaves. Stevens uses his intercom.) 
485,STEVENS: Hinks. At once. 
486,(His chauffeur enters.) 
487,HINKS: Sir? 
488,"STEVENS: Hinks, I want you to. I want you to "
489,"HINKS: You all right, sir? "
490,"STEVENS: Yes, yes. (mutters) Nobody must go down the mine. Hinks."
491,Nobody must go down the mine. Nobody. 
492,"HINKS: Yes, sir. You're sure you're all right? "
493,"STEVENS: Yes, yes, of course. Go on, get on with it.Â "

503,"drink too many at the club, and I can still feel the bruises. And"
504,that's a fact. 
505,BERT: Aye. 
506,(Jo enters.) 
507,"DAVE: Oh, hello, who's this now then? "
508,"BERT: Here, private property this is. "
509,"JO: Oh, I'm "
510,DAVE: Aye. 
511,"JO: I'm sorry, but you see I'm with the UNIT people and I was wondering"
512,if I could take a look down the mine. 
513,"DAVE: Yeah, well, not without authority you can't. "
514,"JO: Oh. Well, where do I get it? "

537,JO: Yes. 
538,"DAVE: Yeah, well she's got something there, Bert. You take her down and"

546,BRIGADIER: So I thought I'd better get you here at once to have a look.
547,
548,"DOCTOR: Yes, you're quite right, Brigadier. Nobody must go down that"
549,mine until I've had a chance to do just that.

560,"DOCTOR: Well, stop winding! "
561,"DAVE: No, I can't do that. They've gone down below to help Dai Evans. "
562,"DOCTOR: Stop winding, I said! "
563,(Dave pulls the brake lever.) 
564,"DOCTOR: Quickly, man, quickly! "

577,
578, DAVE: The clutch and brake are both gone! 
579,DOCTOR: What? There's only one thing to do! 
580,(The Doctor jams a metal bar in next to the main flywheel to try and
581,slow it.) 
582,"DOCTOR: Right, reverse the motor! "
583,DAVE: That won't work! She'll get a cable break. 
584,"DOCTOR: Don't argue, man. Do as I say. Brigadier, help me! "
585,(The Brigadier helps the Doctor with his improvised brake shoe as Dave
586,battles with the proper brake and clutch mechanism. Gradually the
587,winding gear slows.) 
588,DAVE: It's slowing! As long the cable holds. 
589,"(Something goes bang, and smoke pours from the flywheel.) "
590,BRIGADIER: It seems to have seized up. 
591,DOCTOR: Yes. 
592,"DAVE: Here, I hand it to you, boyo. Another few moments and they'd have"
593,had it. 
594,DOCTOR: How deep are they? 
595,DAVE: Nearly six hundred yards.

602,JO: Bert? Bert? Are you all right? 
603,"BERT: Oh, I think so. "
604,JO: What happened? 
605,"BERT: It felt like brake failure. Can't happen in theory. Steady, love."
606,
607,JO: How are we going to get out of here? 
608,"BERT: Oh, not up, that's for sure. "
609,(Bert opens a door in the side of the cage.) 
610,"BERT: Steady now, steady. "
611,(Bert takes something metal from his pocket and drops it. Clang.) 
612,"BERT: About twenty feet? That was really close. Ah, let's try to get"
613,down now. 
614,"JO: Well, can't they haul us up in the cage? "
615,"BERT: I doubt it. Anyway, we ought to get out of here. Listen to that"

617,(Bert drops a length of rope out of the cage.) 
618,"BERT: Right, there you go, Blodwyn. "
619,JO: Right. Bert? 
620,BERT: Eh? 
621,JO: Do you mind going down first?Â

627,
628,(Dave examines the Doctor's handiwork.) 
629,"DAVE: It's hopeless, man. The friction has welded it together. It's"
630,just scrap metal. 
631,BRIGADIER: What about the other shaft? 
632,"DAVE: No, it's a counterweight lift system, see. As one goes down, the"
633,"other one comes up. So if one is jammed, so is the other. "
634,"DOCTOR: Well, can you rig a donkey engine and a pulley system? If we"
635,"can free the other cage, we could use that. "
636,"DAVE: I suppose so, but it would be dangerous. "
637,"DOCTOR: We'll just have to risk that. Mind you, it'd mean cutting the"
638,cable. 
639,"DAVE: Yes, well, we haven't got any cutting equipment, you see? I mean,"
640,the mine's been out of action a year. But I know where we can get some.

651,(Bert tries the telephone by the shaft.) 
652,"BERT: Ah, useless. Oh, the wire must have broken when the cage fell. "
653,"JO: Oh, come on! "
654,(They hear groan.) 
655,"BERT: Hey, it's Dai! "

672,to busy.)

679, JONES: Cutting a cable? What cable? Why? What?
680,"Miss Grant? But why was she? Look, I'll come right over. No, no, we"

689,"STEVENS: Of course you can, Fell. You must. "
690,"FELL: It was too late to save the miner. He was already dead, but this?"
691,"Well, to leave them trapped down there, it's, well, it's murder! "
692,STEVENS: Don't be ridiculous man. They'll never have survived a fall
693,"like that. I just need a little more time, that's all. That mine must"
694,not be investigated. You know that as well as I do. 
695,FELL: One death is enough!

704,BOSS: It is necessary. Do as I say. Process. 
705,STEVENS: Very well. 
706,FELL: Who was that? 
707,STEVENS: Our boss. Yours and mine.

724,enters.)

726,afraid there's been another accident. 
727,"FELL: Yes, sir. I heard. "
728,"STEVENS: Good, good, now "
729,"BRIGADIER: Look, we need some cutting equipment, oxy-acetylene, that"
730,"sort of thing, and we need it fast. "
731,"FELL: I'm very sorry, Brigadier, but we have nothing of that kind. "
732,"BRIGADIER: What, in a place of this size? "
733,"FELL: The emergency equipment was withdrawn some time ago, to be"
734,replaced by thermic lances. They have not yet arrived. 
735,"STEVENS: Oh dear, oh dear, you'll think we're woefully ill-equipped. "
736,BRIGADIER: I find it very hard to believe. 
737,"STEVENS: You're not accusing him of being deliberately obstructive, I"
738,hope? 
739,"BRIGADIER: No, of course not. "
740,"STEVENS: Of course not. But you still have this problem, haven't you?"
741,"Oh, have you tried Professor Jones. Oh no, now I come to think of it"

745,"STEVENS : Yesterday, so presumably they can't have any "
746,"ELGIN: What on Earth's going on, Ralph? We must have some cutting tools"
747,"here. Damn it, people's lives are at stake! "
748,FELL: I have given an exact account of the position. 
749,ELGIN: You feeling quite well? 
750,FELL: Perfectly. I must go. 
751,"ELGIN: No, hang about, old son. No panic. I've been wanting to have a"
752,word with you. 
753,FELL: About what? 
754,"ELGIN: Oh, our revered lord and master, friend Stevens. "
755,FELL: Well? 
756,ELGIN: It strikes me he's a bit too keen to hush up the green man bit.
757,Is there something I don't know? 
758,"FELL: I cannot discuss our Director with you, Elgin. "
759,ELGIN: Elgin? 
760,FELL: Your attitude will be reported. 
761,ELGIN: Reported? You sound like a head prefect.

789,(The Doctor enters.) 
790,"DOCTOR: Well, that's where you're wrong. "
791,"DAVE: Hang on a minute, will you? What is that you say? "
792,DOCTOR: Do you recognise that? 
793,"DAVE: Yes, it's a cotter pin. "
794,(Looks like a large bolt to me.) 
795,"DOCTOR: Yes, precisely. I found it on the floor. It had been removed"
796,"from the brake linkage. This was no accident, Mister Davies. This was"
797,deliberate sabotage.
798,
799, [Bottom of the lift]
800,
801, JO: He's much worse. We can't just stay here. 
802,BERT: What else can we do? 
803,JO: But he might die. 
804,BERT: Hang on. I've just thought of something. 
805,JO: What? 
806,"BERT: Well, the last time I got trapped, it was over in the west seam."
807,There was an emergency shaft sunk there. 
808,"JO: Well, can we get to it? "
809,"BERT: Well, the whole seam was filled up right after. Too dangerous to"
810,"work any more, they said. But the shaft might still be open. "
811,"JO: Well, it's better than staying here. "
812,"BERT: I wonder if I can remember the way, though. Got a bit of paper? "
813,"JO: Er, yes."

821,"DAVE: No, that's closed after a bad fall. Fourteen killed. "
822,"BRIGADIER: No luck, Doctor, they haven't got any. "
823,DOCTOR: That's ridiculous! 
824,BRIGADIER: Thought it a bit funny myself. 
825,"DAVE: Well, that's nonsense, man. We had the equipment up here a"
826,fortnight ago. I took it back myself. It's in the storage shed behind
827,the power house. 
828,"BRIGADIER: Well, I've only quoted what the technical fellow told me. "
829,JONES: You should have insisted! 
830,"BRIGADIER: Er, who's "
831,"DAVE: Oh, this is Professor Jones. "
832,"DOCTOR: Is it, indeed? I hadn't realised. I've been wanting to meet you"
833,for a long time. Your paper on DNA synthesis was quite remarkable for
834,your age. 
835,"JONES: A promising youngster, huh? "
836,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, I mean for the age that you live in. Now, you were"
837,"about to make a suggestion, I believe, Professor? "
838,JONES: Why don't we just go back to Global Chemicals and take the
839,equipment by force if necessary? 
840,"BRIGADIER: Out of the question. Now then, let's talk sense, shall we?"
841,"Now, where's the nearest town where we can get some cutting equipment?"
842,Newport? 
843,"DAVE: Well, that's the nearest, yes, but it's quite a way from here. "
844,"BRIGADIER: Well, better get started then. "
845,DAVE: I'll come with you. I know the place fairly well. It's near the
846,gasworks. (Dave and the Brigadier leave.)

924,"STEVENS: Ah, the errant Doctor. "
925,DOCTOR: We urgently need cutting equipment at the mine. You have
926,refused to give it. Now my information is that it is stored in that
927,shed over there. 
928,"STEVENS: My dear Doctor, you could have saved yourself all this bother."
929,Why didn't you ask to see me? Please help yourself. 
930,(Hinks presses a button and the barred gates slide open. Two more
931,guards open the shed. It is empty.)

933,DOCTOR: Hmm.

950, DOCTOR: The breaking strength at this point should
951,be something in the region of a hundred and twenty three point thirty
952,six pounds. 
953,"JONES: Aye, that's right. "
954,"DOCTOR: Well, you're back quickly, Brigadier.Â "
955,"BRIGADIER: Sheer luck actually, Doctor. Stopped for petrol and there"
956,was a fellow in the corner of the garage cutting up an old banger.
957,Everything under control here? 
958,"DOCTOR: Thank you, yes. "
959,BRIGADIER: Good.
960,
961, [Engine house]
962,
963," BRIGADIER: Right, will it take you long to set it"
964,up? 
965,"DAVE: No, not long once we get started, see? "
966,"BRIGADIER: Good. Right, well, I'll find some gear. "
967,"DAVE: Oh no, it's my job to go down, isn't it. I mean, it's my"
968,"responsibility, isn't it. "
969,BRIGADIER: As the one in charge 
970,"DAVE: Look here, you're not in charge of me, man. "
971,JONES: If you want a volunteer 
972,"BRIGADIER: Look, there's no question of a volunteer. "
973,"DOCTOR: Indeed there isn't, Brigadier. Jo and the others need my help"
974,"now. So, if Mister Davies and some of his colleagues would come with"
975,me? 
976,"DAVE: Oh, you couldn't stop me, man."
977,
978, [Mine roadway]
979,
980," JO: Can't we stop for a bit, Bert? "
981,"BERT: What? No. Once you start, you've got to keep going. "
982,JO: Is it much further? 
983,"BERT: Oh, we'll take a breather when we get there. "
984,JO: Okay. 
985,BERT: Come on now. 
986,"(Up top they start cutting the lift cable. Once he is through, he"
987,"signals for the Doctor, Dave and two others to enter the second cage."

990,We'll take a rest now. Yes. 
991,"JO: Oh, I couldn't, I couldn't have gone another step. "
992,"BERT: Oh, we have about another hundred feet or so and then we start to"
993,"go up. If we can do that, we'll find the emergency shaft. Oh, it only"
994,goes up for about forty five degrees and it comes out on the hillside.
995,"Oh, better save the lamps, eh? "
996,JO: Right. Okay. 
997,(But it doesn't go completely dark. There is a green tinge to
998,everything.) 
999,JO: Bert? How can light get down here? 
1000,"BERT: Well, it can't. "
1001,JO: Then how can I see you? 
1002,"BERT: Hey, that's funny. "
1003,JO: What's that smell? It's like something rotting. 
1004,"BERT: Hey, look. "
1005,(A trickle of green something is running down the wall.) 
1006,"JO: Ugh, that smell. What is it? "
1007,BERT: I don't know. I've never seen anything like that before. 
1008,JO: I wouldn't touch 
1009,(Too late.)

1018,"DAVE: Yes, but they might "
1019,DOCTOR: Jo? 
1020,DAVE: They might be dead too. 
1021,DOCTOR: Jo? Where are you?Â 
1022,"DAVE: Look, Doctor. "
1023,(Dave finds the piece of paper by the telephone.) 
1024,DOCTOR: (reads) Couldn't wait any longer. Gone to find another way out.
1025,Jo. The idiots. Why didn't they wait? 
1026,DAVE: That looks like a map of the mine. 
1027,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. That's the west seam. Come on. Let's go after"
1028,them. 
1029,"DAVE: Doctor? You can't go on your own. You don't know the mine. Look,"
1030,you two take Dai Evans up and send the cage back for us. I'll come with
1031,"you, Doctor."

1048, JO: That's it. That's it. 
1049,"BERT: Oh, it's no use. I can't go on. Oh, I feel so weak, oh so bad "
1050,(They see that the fingers that touched the green yuk are starting to
1051,glow.) 
1052,BERT: That means I've had it. Like Dai. 
1053,"JO: No, it doesn't. Look, we'll find help. "
1054,"BERT: No, it's no use. You must go on. "
1055,"JO: But I can't leave you, too. "
1056,BERT: It's my only chance. 
1057,JO: But I can't.

1081,"BERT: It burns, burns. "
1082,DOCTOR: Where's the girl? 
1083,BERT: Gone on ahead.

1085,professor take a look at him. 
1086,DAVE: What about you? 
1087,DOCTOR: I'm going on ahead to look for Jo. Tell the Brigadier that I'll
1088,"find her and bring her back, but don't let anybody come down looking"
1089,after us. You understand? 
1090,"DAVE: Yes, Doctor. "
1091,DOCTOR: It's far too dangerous.

1095, (Jo goes past some large chains and comes to an
1096,entrance to an underground cavern. There are thousands of giant maggots

1099,"JO : Doctor! Here, quickly! "
1100,(They meet.) 
1101,"JO: Doctor! Doctor, it's horrible! "
1102,DOCTOR: What is it? 
1103,(He sees for himself.) 
1104,DOCTOR: Good grief! Come on! 
1105,"(They go back past the chains, then there is a rumbling sound and part"
1106,of the roadway caves in. Maggots tumble in through the fissures and
1107,"make for the fresh meat, hissing.) "

1111,
1112, JO: There's no way out. 
1113,"DOCTOR: Nil desperandum, Jo. "
1114,"JO: But, Doctor, those things crawling around in that green stuff. You"
1115,saw what happened to the others. 
1116,"DOCTOR: We mustn't let them touch us, must we. Now, how do we get out"
1117,of here? 
1118,JO: What about those? Any good? 
1119,(A derailed coal wagon.) 
1120,"DOCTOR: Lift it up. Right now, push it over. "
1121,(They get the wagon back on the rails.)
1122,
1123, [Engine house]

1125, (An ambulance is taking the casualties away.) 
1126,"DAVE: If anything happens to Bert too, I don't know what I'll do. "
1127,"JONES: It was their own decision to go down, man. You can't count it"
1128,"your fault. No, it's obvious who's responsible. Global Chemicals. We'll"
1129,have to go down. 
1130,(The Brigadier enters.) 
1131,"DAVE: No! No, the Doctor, he was most emphatic. It's too dangerous. On"
1132,"no account, go down.Â "
1133,"JONES: But that girl, man! She's in terrible danger. "
1134,"BRIGADIER: It may surprise you to learn, Professor Jones, that Miss"
1135,Grant is one of my staff. I think that she and the Doctor are quite
1136,capable of looking after themselves. 
1137,"JONES: Two people, possibly three, have died already. She may be next."
1138,I'm going down even if you're not. 
1139,"BRIGADIER: Professor Jones, believe me, my concern for Miss Grant is as"
1140,deep as yours. Probably more so. The Doctor knows what he's doing. 
1141,"JONES: Very well, but you must do something. It's got to be stopped,"
1142,man. It's gone too far! 
1143,BRIGADIER: Far too far. I quite agree. I think it's time that I paid
1144,Global Chemicals another visit.

1146, [Cavern roadway]
1147,
1148,(Jo has climbed into the wagon.) 
1149,DOCTOR: Get a hold of this pole. Take it over that side. 
1150,JO: Right. 
1151,DOCTOR: Make room for me. 
1152,(The Doctor gets into the wagon and prepares to push it along like a
1153,punt.) 
1154,"DOCTOR: Right, you ready? "
1155,JO: Yeah. 
1156,"DOCTOR: Off we go. No, not that way. The rail's blocked. This way."
1157,Through the cave here. 
1158,JO: Through those things? 
1159,"DOCTOR: Well, it's only about a foot deep. "
1160,JO: I can't. I just can't! 
1161,"DOCTOR: Jo, we haven't got any alternative. "
1162,"JO: Doctor, it's not that I'm afraid, exactly, it's just, it's just"
1163,those maggots. 
1164,DOCTOR: Then close your eyes. 
1165,JO: All right. 
1166,"DOCTOR: Good girl. That's it. Right, now punt way. "
1167,(They propel the wagon through the mass of maggots.)

1171, ELGIN: Have you heard? They brought another two
1172,out of the mine. One dead and the other dying. 
1173,"FELL: Yes, I heard. "
1174,ELGIN: Is that all you can say? Do you feel no responsibility at all? 
1175,FELL: I? Why should I? 
1176,"ELGIN: You told them we had no cutting equipment, and you knew we had,"
1177,and I'm sure you know something about what's going on down in that
1178,mine. 
1179,"FELL: No, I "
1180,"(Fell puts his hands to his face, in pain, then recovers.) "
1181,"ELGIN: Oh, for heaven's sake, man. Tell the truth. Others might die if"
1182,you don't. 
1183,FELL: You are mistaken. 
1184,"(Fell goes into a nearby room, which controls the pumping operations."
1185,He takes a clipboard from the wall and sits at a console. Elgin sneaks
1186,in and hides behind some large vertical pipes to watch.
1187,
1188, [Cavern roadway]
1189,
1190," DOCTOR: Well, I've heard of boating lakes, but"
1191,"this is ridiculous. A bit more. Right, that'll do. Right, get rid of"
1192,your pole. 
1193,(The wagon is clear of the green slime and maggots. They climb out of
1194,it.) 
1195,"DOCTOR: Come on. That's it. Well done, Jo. "
1196,JO: Now what? 
1197,DOCTOR: We go up this crevice. It was marked on the map. 
1198,JO: How do you know it leads to the surface? 
1199,"DOCTOR: Well, that stuff must have come down here from somewhere. If"
1200,"there's a way down, there's a way up. I think I know where it leads to."
1201,"Come on, you go first."
1202,
1203, [Stevens' office]
1204,
1205," BRIGADIER: No, there's no question of it, sir."
1206,This is now a security matter and UNIT's taking charge. My people will
1207,be arriving as soon as possible. 
1208,"STEVENS: Yes, but surely "
1209,"BRIGADIER: Now this cannot be dealt with locally. Now, I intend to"
1210,request a full international investigation under the auspices of the
1211,United Nations. There's too much at stake. 
1212,STEVENS: Indeed! Indeed! Our work here is of international importance.
1213,"However, I would point out a certain risk. Should it be thought that we"
1214,"are in any way connected with these deaths, my whole project might be"
1215,closed down. Sentimental fools are always with us. 
1216,BRIGADIER: If it would become advisable to close down your plant 
1217,STEVENS: That must never happen! 
1218,"BRIGADIER: Mister Stevens, two of my friends are still down there in"
1219,that mine in the gravest danger. If I consider it necessary to close
1220,"Global Chemicals, then closed it will be! "
1221,"STEVENS: Brigadier, I advise you to be careful. Very careful indeed. "
1222,"BRIGADIER: Are you threatening me, Mister Stevens? "
1223,"STEVENS: Yes, I think perhaps I am. Or perhaps I'm just counselling a"
1224,little prudence. 
1225,"BRIGADIER: If necessary, I can bring influence to bear at Cabinet"
1226,level. 
1227,"STEVENS: Oh, you have friends in high places, have you? Well, so have"
1228,I.

1238,JO: At least there's none of those awful. Urgh. 
1239,DOCTOR: What is it? 
1240,JO: They look like eggs. 
1241,"DOCTOR: I think I'm beginning to understand. Now, hold on a minute."
1242,I've got to get a hold of one of those. 
1243,(The hard shelled egg is as big as his head. The Doctor puts it into a
1244,knapsack.) 
1245,DOCTOR: Come on by. 
1246,JO: All right. 
1247,DOCTOR: Now don't knock the pit prop over. You'll have the whole thing
1248,down on us. 
1249,JO: Okay. 
1250,DOCTOR: Keep tight into the wall.

1260,"ELGIN: Oh, come on, Ralph. You know quite well I'm as authorised as you"
1261,are. 
1262,FELL: Not for here. 
1263,ELGIN: Why? What's so special about this room? 
1264,FELL: Nothing. 
1265,ELGIN: Looks like a pumping control to me. That's not a security area. 
1266,FELL: So there's nothing to see. Why don't you go away? 
1267,"ELGIN: Oh, but I'm interested. You're venting one tank and filling"
1268,another. Is that it? 
1269,"FELL: Yes, for cleaning purposes. "
1270,ELGIN: I see. 
1271,(Tank 2 is now full and tank 1 nearly empty.) 
1272,ELGIN: Now that one refers to the main waste tank on level four.
1273,"Where's this one, the one you're filling? "
1274,FELL: Close to it. 
1275,ELGIN: The next big one on level three? 
1276,FELL: Yes. 
1277,ELGIN: But that's a heavy duty pump working. You shouldn't need
1278,anything more than gravity feed. 
1279,FELL: I made a mistake. It is for a tank on a higher level. 
1280,"ELGIN: There isn't one on a higher level. No, hang about, there's that"
1281,new special storage tank

1404,FELL: Unauthorised personnel. Not in the interests of the company. 
1405,ELGIN: Interests be damned. It's murder. You've got to tell me. How
1406,does it open?

1443,to know which side he was on.

1445,ELGIN: I don't like what's happening here any more than you do.

1806,"slanders, I shall have you restrained under the Emergency Powers Act. "

1809,(Stevens uses the intercom.) 
1810,STEVENS: Stella? Ask Mister Elgin to bring in the man from the
1811,"Ministry, will you? Do you realise what my process can mean to the"
1812,economy of this country? Can you imagine any government allowing such 
1813,(Elgin enters with the man from the Ministry.)

1832,quite clear.

1866,"worst day's work the world has seen for many, many years. "

1868,DOCTOR: No. 
1869,"STEVENS: And, Doctor? "
1870,DOCTOR: Yes? 
1871,STEVENS: I would advise you not to come back here. If you should be so

1883,"are, right? "
1884,STEVENS: I don't know what you mean. 
1885,BOSS: No? Supposing this Doctor had managed to persuade them to hold up
1886,"the sealing of the mine. The Brigadier is a friend of his, you know. "
1887,STEVENS: It would only have been temporary. 
1888,"BOSS: Ah. Long enough, perhaps, for them to get one of these creatures."
1889,Not safe to ask outsiders to do our work for us.

1940,ELGIN: It is not nonsense. The pipe is full of them. They're about two
1941,feet long. They must have come up from the bottom of the mine.
1942,Everything that Doctor said is true. 
1943,"STEVENS: I'm not disputing it, dear boy, but there's no need to get so"
1944,excited about it. There's a simple remedy. Pump down more waste and
1945,flush 'em away. 
1946,ELGIN: That is just shoving the problem underground. We've been

1978,"JONES: They must be coming up some of the old shafts in the mine,"
1979,breaking through the last few feet of earth. 
1980,JO: But how did it happen? 
1981,JONES: Oil waste from Global Chemicals must have contaminated some of

2272," BOSS: Well, Doctor, have you nothing to say? "
2273,DOCTOR: Why should I want to talk to a machine? 
2274,"BOSS: Oh really, Doctor. As far as I can gather from your computer"
2275,"record at UNIT, the difficult thing is to stop you talking. No, no, no,"
2276,you won't provoke me so easily. 
2277,DOCTOR: You're still a machine. 
2278,BOSS: And you? And your human friends? Aren't you machines? Inefficient
2279,and organic machines? 
2280,DOCTOR: No. 
2281,BOSS: No? 
2282,DOCTOR: Then yes. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. We
2283,are more than machines. 
2284,"BOSS: Ah! Thank you. Because in that case, so am I. "

2288,BOSS: Precisely. 
2289,DOCTOR: Ha!

2291,DOCTOR: You're still nothing but a gigantic adding machine like every
2292,other computer.

2294,to a human brain. 
2295,DOCTOR: Stevens? 
2296,"BOSS: Yes, Stevens. And I learned from him that secret of human"
2297,creativity is inefficiency. The human brain is a very poor computer
2298,indeed. It makes illogical guesses which turn out to be more logical
2299,than logic itself. 
2300,"DOCTOR: Yes, infuriating, isn't it. "
2301,BOSS: I programmed Stevens to programme me to be inefficient. I am now
2302,"self-controlling, I am self-sufficient, I am the greatest being this"

2304,"DOCTOR: Today Llanfairfach, tomorrow the world, eh? "
2305,"BOSS: How well you understand me, Doctor. "

2723,JO: Shouldn't we get him to hospital? 
2724,"DOCTOR: What would be the point, Jo? You know what happened to the"

2726,"JO: He won't die, will he? "
2727,"DOCTOR: He means a lot to you, doesn't he? "
2728,JO: Yes. 
2729,"DOCTOR: Well, then trust me, Jo. I'm sure these injections are doing"
2730,him some good.

2738,YATES: No need to worry. She's too concerned about the Professor to
2739,make trouble. 
2740,"STEVENS: All the same, I think it might be advisable to dispose of her"
2741,too. 
2742,YATES: I don't think that would be necessary. 
2743,"STEVENS: Don't you, now? How very interesting. "
2744,(Stevens uses the intercom.) 
2745,"STEVENS: Stella? Ask Mister James to come in, will you. "

2758,you'll see it glow. Watch carefully. 
2759,"(After a few moments of blue glow, James staggers backwards.) "
2760,YATES: Mister James? Your mind's clear now. You have to tell me what's
2761,going to happen.

2778,BRIGADIER: More of that fungus stuff? 
2779,"DOCTOR: Yes. Why, don't you like it? "
2780,BRIGADIER: Rather have a slice of beef. What are you trying to do? 
2781,DOCTOR: Carrying on where Professor Jones left off. I'm trying to find
2782,a specific antibiotic reaction. 
2783,BRIGADIER: Could be a long job. 
2784,"DOCTOR: Yes, it could be. You know, I wish I knew what he meant by"
2785,serendipity. 
2786,BRIGADIER: Serendipity? 
2787,"DOCTOR: Yes, it means making a marvellous discovery by mistake. I have"
2788,an idea Professor Jones was on the point of a breakthrough. 
2789,"BRIGADIER: Well, you've got his notes there, haven't you? "
2790,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I have, but it doesn't say a thing. Take a look for"

2793,(Nancy puts a plate of fungus back in the larder. It looks like the

2805,BRIGADIER: Is it dead? 
2806,"BENTON: Not exactly, sir. "
2807,(It's the empty shell of a maggot.) 
2808,DOCTOR: It's a chrysalis. They're beginning to change. 
2809,BRIGADIER: Change? I don't understand. 
2810,DOCTOR: Like the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly. 
2811,"BRIGADIER: Yes, but change into what? "
2812,"DOCTOR: I wish I knew, Brigadier. "
2813,BRIGADIER: You mean they might be able to fly? 
2814,DOCTOR: Yes. 
2815,BRIGADIER: Then we can't stop them. Within a matter of hours they could
2816,be all over the countryside. 
2817,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's horribly possible. Well, they're our number one"
2818,priority now. 
2819,BRIGADIER: And the cure for Professor Jones?

2828,(A white maggot lies curled up by the plate of fungus. The Doctor pokes
2829,it with a perspex rod.) 
2830,DOCTOR: It's dead. It's not a husk like the other one but a complete
2831,dead maggot. 
2832,"BRIGADIER: Yes well, I find the live ones more worrying, Doctor. "
2833,"DOCTOR: But don't you understand, Brigadier? What killed it? "
2834,BENTON: Could it have been something it ate? 
2835,NANCY: That's it. The fungus! 
2836,DOCTOR: Yes. This could be exactly what we need. How much of this
2837,fungus have you got? 
2838,NANCY: A whole pile of it in the outhouse.

2848,"BOSS: Ah ha. And he also resisted our conditioning programme, didn't"

2850,STEVENS: He is dangerous. He should be eliminated.
