23, (The volcanic eruption from Inferno jolts the
24,Doctor upright from his chaise longue on a mosaic floor. Either side of
25,"an altar stand a pair of large Minoan quadruple-headed axes, and behind"
26,them a giant complex crystal pulses.) 
27,MASTER: Welcome! Welcome to your new Master! 
28,"(The Master breaks into maniacal laughter, a lightning bolt comes down"
29,"and he vanishes. Volcanic smoke fills the room, there are images of"
30,ceremonial masks and Minoan gods and goddesses.) 
31,DOCTOR: Jo! Jo! Jo!
32,
33, [UNIT Laboratory]
34,
35, DOCTOR: Jo. 
36,JO: Doctor. Doctor. Are you all right? 
37,"DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, I must have been dreaming. "
38,JO: I'll say you were. A real pippin of a dream. I've brought you a cup
39,of tea. Do you want it? 
40,DOCTOR: Yes. Volcanoes and earthquakes. 
41,"(The Doctor gets up, walks a few steps and hands the cup of tea back to"
42,Jo.) 
43,DOCTOR: Thank you. I enjoyed that. 
44,"JO: Doctor, have you been working all night again? On that? I don't"
45,"know. What is anyway, a super dematerialisation circuit? "
46,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. No, that'll have to wait. No, this is far more"
47,important. It might make all the difference the next time he turns up. 
48,JO: The next time who turns up? 
49,"DOCTOR: The Master, of course. Jo, now listen to me. I want you to find"
50,out as quickly as possible if there have been any volcanic eruptions or
51,severe earthquakes recently. It doesn't matter where. Anywhere in the
52,world. 
53,"JO: You're joking, of course. "
54,"DOCTOR: Believe me, this is no matter for jokes. "
55,"JO: But I read it all out to last night, I. Don't go away. "
56,(Jo fetches a newspaper from a table by the chaise longue.) 
57,"JO: It just shows you don't listen to a word I say, doesn't it. Now,"
58,"yes, here we are. New eruptions in the Thera group of islands."
59,Somewhere off Greece. 
60,DOCTOR: Does it say anything about a crystal? 
61,JO: Crystal? 
62,DOCTOR: Mmm. 
63,"JO: No, what crystal? Look, I know I'm exceedingly dim, but would you"
64,mind explaining? 
65,"DOCTOR: It was in my dream, Jo. There was a large crystal, shaped like"
66,a trident.

69,
70, (That would be a large version of the one being
71,held up by a man in a white coat and shown to his blonde lady
72,assistant.) 
73,"MASTER: (with a very slight Greek accent) A simple piece of quartz,"
74,nothing more. 
75,"RUTH: But Professor Thascales, that is ridiculous. "
76,"MASTER: Of course it is, Doctor Ingram. Of course it is. "
77,(The Master puts the crystal into a box-like device.) 
78,"MASTER: You know, there is no means whereby I could prove to you that"
79,"that crystal is any different from any other piece of quartz, and yet"
80,"it is unique. As you say, ridiculous!"
81,
82, [Newton Institute laboratory]
83,
84, (The Master takes off his lab coat as they go into
85,the main area of the lab.) 
86,"RUTH: So, this is the missing piece of equipment we've been waiting"
87,for? 
88,MASTER: Exactly. 
89,(A young man with long hair and moustache enters.) 
90,"HYDE: I'll swear I switched that alarm off in my sleep. Oh, sorry,"
91,Prof. 
92,"RUTH: Simmer down, Stu, for Pete's sake. "
93,MASTER: Please do not call me Prof. 
94,HYDE: In the doghouse again. 
95,"MASTER: Now quiet, both of you. Now listen. I have a meeting with the"
96,"new director in two and a half minutes, so I'm afraid I shall have to"
97,leave the final tests for the demonstration to the two of you. 
98,"RUTH: But aren't we going to have a trial run, Professor? "
99,"MASTER: No, it's not necessary. "
100,"HYDE: Well, that's marvellous. We're going to look a right bunch of"
101,Charlies if this fellow from the Grants Committee turns up and we're
102,left with egg on our faces. 
103,"RUTH: Yes, surely, Professor, it would be very unwise "
104,"MASTER: Now look, my dear, there is no need for you to worry your"
105,pretty little head. 
106,"RUTH: And there's no need for you to be so patronising, Professor."
107,"Look, just because I'm a woman, there's no need to treat me like "
108,HYDE: Here we go. 
109,"MASTER: No, no, no, I'm sorry, you're quite right, Doctor. Please"
110,"forgive me. And now, er, would you please run those tests? "
111,(The Master leaves.) 
112,"RUTH: That man. You know, I don't what infuriates me more. His"
113,"dictatorial manner or that infernal courtesy of his. It's all the same,"
114,really. A bland assumption of male superiority. 
115,HYDE: May God bless the good ship women's lib and all who sail in her.

119, (Yates unrolls a map and points to an island
120,labelled Niohpa.) 
121,"YATES: There you are, Jo, the Thera group. Those little islands there. "
122,JO: Doctor? 
123,DOCTOR: Mmm? 
124,JO: Come and take a look. 
125,"DOCTOR: No, not now, Jo. I'm busy. "
126,JO: But it's the map you asked for. 
127,DOCTOR: Oh? 
128,"YATES: There, you see? "
129,DOCTOR: Thera. It doesn't mean a thing to me. 
130,"JO: Well, it says Santorini in brackets. Well, that must be another"
131,name for it. How about that? 
132,"DOCTOR: Oh, let's forget all about it, Jo, shall we? I just had a"
133,"nightmare, that's all. "
134,"JO: Sorry, Mike. "
135,YATES: Better than hanging round the duty room. If nothing turns up
136,"soon, I'll go round the twist. "
137,"JO: That makes two of us. Here was I, all ready for a nice little trip"
138,to Atlantis. 
139,DOCTOR: What? 
140,"JO: Well, nothing. I was just saying to Mike "
141,"DOCTOR: Yes, I heard what you said, but you said Atlantis. Why"
142,Atlantis? 
143,"JO: Well, that's what it says in the paper. "
144,"DOCTOR: Give me that map, Captain Yates. "
145,"JO: Yes, here we are. Believed by many modern historians to be all that"
146,remains of Plato's metropolis of Atlantis. 
147,DOCTOR: Of course. Of course. 
148,YATES: Atlantis? I thought that was supposed to be in the middle of the
149,Atlantic Ocean? 
150,JO: You're a bit out of date. Apparently it was part of the Minoan
151,"civilisation. Oh, you know, the Minotaur and all the Cretan jazz. "
152,"YATES: It's only a legend though, isn't it? "
153,"DOCTOR: Jo, get me the Brigadier, will you? "
154,"JO: What, now? "
155,"DOCTOR: Yes, now. "
156,"JO: Oh, all right. "
157,"YATES: The Brig? Why the Brig, for heaven's sake? "
158,JO: Search me. 
159,(Jo picks up the telephone.) 
160,JO: Doctor? It's the Brigadier. 
161,"DOCTOR: Hello, Brigadier? It's the Doctor here. Now listen to me. I"
162,want you to put out a world wide warning. Alert all your precious UNIT
163,"HQ's, not that it'll do any good. "
164, [Brigadier's office]
165,
166, BRIGADIER: Thank you very much. And against what
167,precisely am I supposed to be warning the world? 
168,DOCTOR : The Master. I've just seen him. 
169,BRIGADIER: (Into phone.) Seen him? Where? When?
170,
171, [UNIT Laboratory]
172,
173, DOCTOR: In a dream. Not half an hour ago. 
174,(The Brigadier has come to the lab as the Master has left the Newton
175,"Institute - actually Swallowfield Park, Berkshire.) "
176,"BRIGADIER: In any case, Doctor, every section of UNIT now has the"
177,search for the Master written into standing orders. 
178,"DOCTOR: Priority Z one hundred and forty four, I suppose? "
179,"BRIGADIER: Priority A one, actually. "
180,"DOCTOR: Look, I tell you, Brigadier, there is grave danger. "
181,"BRIGADIER: Danger of what, for heavens sake? "
182,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm not sure, but in my dream I quite clearly saw "
183,"BRIGADIER: You know, if this got out, you'd be the laughing stock of"
184,"UNIT. A dream. Really, Doctor, you'll be consulting the entrails of a"
185,sheep next. 
186,(Jo laughs.) 
187,"BRIGADIER: Right, we'd better be on our way to the Newton Institute."
188,"Ready, Doctor? "
189,"DOCTOR: No, I can't go anywhere at the moment. I'm far too busy. "
190,"BRIGADIER: But I told them you'd be coming. Two observers from UNIT,"
191,they said. 
192,"JO: Oh, shall I go? "
193,"DOCTOR: No, certainly not, Jo. I shall need you here with me. "
194,"JO: Well, what's it all about anyway? "
195,"BRIGADIER: TOM-TIT, that's what it's all about. A demonstration of"
196,TOM-TIT. 
197,YATES: TOM-TIT? What on earth does that stand for? 
198,"BRIGADIER: Well, it's the, er, the trans "
199,DOCTOR: Transmission Of Matter Through Interstitial Time. 
200,"BRIGADIER: Yes, exactly what I was going to say. TOM-TIT. "
201,"JO: Well, what does it do? "
202,"BRIGADIER: Oh, it's a brilliant idea. Apparently it can break down"
203,"solid objects into light-waves or whatever, and transmit them from one"
204,place to another. 
205,YATES: And it works? 
206,"BRIGADIER: Apparently. Well, Yates, I suppose you'd better come with"
207,me. 
208,"YATES: Sorry, sir. I'm Duty Officer. "
209,"BRIGADIER: Well, someone's got to come. "
210,"(Benton enters, in ordinary clothes and carrying a bag.) "
211,"BENTON: I'm just leaving, sir. "
212,"BRIGADIER: Ah, Sergeant Benton. The very man. "
213,"BENTON: But I'm just off on a forty eight hour pass, sir. "
214,"BRIGADIER: Oh no, you're not, Sergeant. You're coming for a little trip"
215,to the Newton Institute. 
216,"BENTON: Yes, sir. The where, sir? The Newton Institute? "
217,"BRIGADIER: That's right. It's a research establishment at Wootton, just"
218,outside Cambridge.
219,
220, [Director's office]
221,
222, (At the Institute.) 
223,MASTER: A charlatan? How dare you. 
224,"PERCIVAL: Doctor Cook is not only chairman of the Grants Committee, but"
225,a colleague and a personal friend. Am I to tell him this afternoon that
226,I am as gullible as that drunkard I have replaced? How is it that I can
227,find no trace of your academic career before you visited Athens
228,"University, Professor? How is it that you publish nothing? That you"
229,refuse to reveal the hypothesis behind your so-called experiment? That
230,"the very name of your project is arrant nonsense! TOM-TIT! What,"
231,"pray, is interstitial time? "
232,"MASTER: You're a very clever man, Director. I can see that I shall have"
233,"to tell you everything. Oh, yes, you're perfectly right. I am no"
234,professor. 
235,"PERCIVAL: Ah, say no more. "
236,MASTER: But do please hear me out. I can see that you're very upset. 
237,PERCIVAL: Upset. 
238,MASTER: But there is nothing to worry about. You must believe me. You
239,must believe me. You must believe me. 
240,"(Percival looks the Master in the eye, and gets the Look in return.) "
241,PERCIVAL: Must believe you. 
242,"MASTER: I am the Master. You will listen to me, and you will obey me."
243,You will obey me! 
244,PERCIVAL: Obey. Obey. I will obey. 
245,MASTER: That's better. Now you just sit there quietly and await the
246,arrival of this wretched man from London. And remember you are
247,"perfectly satisfied as to the authenticity of my credentials, and the"
248,integrity of my work here. You understand? 
249,PERCIVAL: Yes I understand.

253, (Ruth is at the control desk in the main lab while
254,Stuart Hyde is in the radiation lab next door.) 
255,RUTH: One point three five nine. 
256,"HYDE : One point three five nine, check. "
257,RUTH: Two point oh four five. 
258,"HYDE : Two point oh four five, check. "
259,RUTH: Three point oh six two. 
260,"HYDE : Three point oh six two, check."
261,
262, [Newton Institute radiation laboratory]
263,
264, RUTH : Five nine and steady. 
265,HYDE: Five nine and steady. 
266,RUTH : And that's the lot. 
267,"HYDE: And that's the lot. Check, check, check."
268,
269, [Newton Institute laboratory]
270,
271, RUTH: Now we just stand around and wait. 
272,(Hyde enters.) 
273,"RUTH: You know, I still think it's just plain stupid not to do a trial"
274,run. It's ludicrous. 
275,"HYDE: Ludicrous, check. "
276,"RUTH: Oh, grow up, Stu. "
277,"HYDE: No, but I mean it, love. It is ludicrous. I mean, just suppose"
278,this thing won't wag its tail when we tell it to? 
279,"RUTH: Well, they withdraw the grant. "
280,"HYDE: As sure as God made little green apples, and bang goes my"
281,fellowship. 
282,"RUTH: Bang goes my job. And my reputation, too, for that matter. Men."
283,It's their conceit that bugs me. 
284,"HYDE: Hey, hey, I'm on your side, remember? "
285,"RUTH: Oh, you don't count. "
286,"HYDE: Oh, don't I? And why not, may I ask? "
287,"RUTH: Look, don't bully me, Stu, or I think I'll burst into tears. "
288,HYDE: Let's do it! 
289,RUTH: What? 
290,HYDE: Have a run through. 
291,RUTH: Without him? 
292,"HYDE: Well, why not? "
293,"RUTH: Well, it is his project. I mean, he's the boss. "
294,HYDE: Nominally. But you think how much you've put into it. It's a
295,joint affair. I reckon you've as much right to take a decision as he
296,has. 
297,RUTH: Well. 
298,"HYDE: Course, if you need a man in charge. "
299,RUTH: That does it. We go ahead. 
300,HYDE: That's my girl.

303,
304," (The Doctor is finishing his latest device, hand"
305,sized with two dials on the face.) 
306,"JO: You know, Doctor, you're quite the most infuriating man I've ever"
307,"met. I've asked you at least a million times, what is it? "
308,DOCTOR: Extraordinary. I could have sworn I'd told you. It's a time
309,sensor. 
310,"JO: Oh, I see. "
311,"DOCTOR: Do you? Well, what's it do then? "
312,"JO: Well, it, er. "
313,DOCTOR: Mmm hmm? 
314,"JO: It, er, detects disturbances in a time field. "
315,"DOCTOR: Well done, Jo. You're learning. Exactly what you need if you"
316,happen to be looking for a Tardis. 
317,JO: It's a Tardis sniffer-outer. 
318,"DOCTOR: Or any other time machine, for that matter. So, if the Master"
319,turns up again 
320,JO: Bingo. 
321,"DOCTOR: As you so rightly say, Bingo."
322,
323, [Newton Institute laboratory]
324,
325, (Hyde is putting on a radiation suit.) 
326,HYDE: I feel like the back end of a pantomime horse. 
327,RUTH: Very suitable for a keen young man like you. 
328,"HYDE: Eh, come again? "
329,RUTH: Starting at the bottom. 
330,"HYDE: Oh! Anyway, it's just a waste of time. Why should there be any"
331,radiation in the receiver room? We're only going to use about ten
332,degrees. 
333,RUTH: Are you willing to take the risk? 
334,HYDE: No. 
335,"RUTH: Well, stop beefing then and get on with it."

351,
352, (The Doctor has gone inside the Tardis.) 
353,"JO: I say, Doctor, you're not going to disappear to Venus or anywhere"
354,"like that, are you? "
355,"DOCTOR : No, no. You just keep your eye on those dials. "
356,(A little round aerial on the time detector starts spinning.) 
357,JO: It's working! 
358,DOCTOR : Well of course it's working. Now make a note of the
359,"readings, will you? "
360,JO: All right.
361,
362, [Newton Institute laboratory]

370,The Doctor comes out of the Tardis.) 
371,JO: Well done. 
372,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
373,JO: It's a bit out on distance though. It says the Tardis is only a
374,foot away. 
375,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's Venusian feet. "
376,"JO: Oh, they're larger than ours. "
377,"DOCTOR: Oh yeah, much larger. Always tripping over themselves, the"
378,"Venusians. Good, that's good. "
379,(The time detector springs into life.) 
380,JO: Doctor? 
381,DOCTOR: Mmm? 
382,JO: I think you must have left something on in the Tardis. 
383,DOCTOR: I certainly didn't. why? 
384,"JO: Well, it's started again. "
385,DOCTOR: That's impossible unless 
386,JO: Unless what? 
387,DOCTOR: Another Tardis!

391, RUTH : Isolate matrix scanner. 
392,HYDE: Check. 
393,"RUTH : Five oh, five five, six oh. "
394,(The outline of the jar flickers on the receiving plate.) 
395,HYDE: It's going to work! 
396,RUTH : Pipe down and concentrate. Stand by. Initiating transfer
397,now.

401, (The Master has taken over the office and is
402,working at the desk. Outside the clock over the old stable block starts
403,"to chime eleven, but the chimes become longer and longer.) "

405,
406, [Newton Institute laboratory]
407,
408,(The jar is glowing.)

415,ground.)

419,"RUTH : Come here, Stuart!"
420,
421, [Newton Institute laboratory]
422,
423, RUTH: It's a positive feedback. She's overloading!
424,"Look, you'll have to bring the surge down as I reduce the power or"
425,she'll blow. 
426,HYDE: Right! 
427,"(Next door, the window cleaner watches the crystal in the device glow,"
428,"then he falls backwards off his ladder, slowly. The Master comes out of"
429,the admin block and sees the ladder up against the wall.) 
430,HYDE: We've done it! We've done it! We've done it! We've done it! We've
431,done it! We've done it! We've done it! We've done it! We've done it!

435,
436, (The Doctor is looking at a map of England.) 
437,"DOCTOR: Now, I put it somewhere in that sector there. Anything between"
438,fifty and a hundred miles from here. 
439,"JO: Well, that's not much to go on. "
440,"DOCTOR: No, not unless he switches his Tardis on again. "
441,"JO: Well, you never know, he might. "
442,DOCTOR: If we were a bit nearer and in Bessie. 
443,JO: Right. Let's go. You take the map.

446,
447," MASTER: You are a fool, Doctor Ingram. "
448,RUTH: You have no right to call me a fool 
449,MASTER: Be silent! You may have caused irreparable damage. 
450,"RUTH: Look, I was in full control the whole time. "
451,"MASTER: That is irrelevant. Mister Hyde, why did you permit this"
452,stupidity? 
453,"HYDE: Here, hang about, mate. I'm not my sister's keeper. She's the"
454,"boss. Anyway, I suggested it. "
455,"MASTER: Yes, I might have guessed it. You're behaving like a an"
456,irresponsible schoolboy. You'll pay for this. 
457,"RUTH: The decision, professor, was entirely mine. "
458,"MASTER: Ah, I see. Therefore "
459,"RUTH: I take I take full responsibility for testing the apparatus, and"
460,I'm prepared to justify my actions at the highest level. Perhaps we'd
461,better go and see the Director right away and sort this out. 
462,"MASTER: No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry, Doctor. Please excuse me."
463,That won't be necessary. We need take this matter no further. 
464,"RUTH: Well, that's all very well, Professor, but after what you "
465,"MASTER: Please, Doctor, accept my apologies. "
466,"RUTH: Oh well, perhaps it was a bit unethical of me not to have told"
467,you. 
468,"HYDE: Oh, come off it, Ruth. He's only climbing down because he doesn't"
469,want us to walk out. He needs us for the demo. 
470,"MASTER: How very clever of you, Mister Hyde. Of course I need you. Both"
471,of you. 
472,"HYDE: After all, Prof, we couldn't risk a foul-up this afternoon when"
473,the 
474,MASTER: Now say no more. The whole matter is closed. 
475,"RUTH: Well, not quite, professor. You see, it wasn't exactly plain"
476,sailing. We had some sort of a positive feedback. An overload. 
477,"MASTER: But, but that is impossible. "
478,RUTH: See for yourself. 
479,(Ruth tears off the computer printout for the Master.) 
480,RUTH: See? 
481,"MASTER: I see. Yes. Of course, how foolish of me. "
482,"HYDE: Hey, Ruth, Professor, come here. "
483,"RUTH: What is it, Stu? "
484,HYDE: The crystal. It's still glowing. 
485,"MASTER: Well, of course it is! "
486,"RUTH: Well, you know what caused the overload then? "
487,MASTER: Yes. Don't you see? You were drawing power from somewhere
488,"outside of time itself. Now, what we have to do is to build a time"
489,"vector filter into the transmitter here. Look, let me show you."
490,something like this. 
491,(The Master sketches a diagram on the back of the printout.) 
492,"MASTER: It's a paracybernetic control circuit, in fact. "
493,"RUTH: Yes, but won't that take some time to set up? The demonstration's"
494,at two. 
495,"MASTER: Yes, I'm afraid it will take some time, and I'm afraid I will"
496,"have to leave it to you, because I am expected to eat a pretentious"
497,meal and exchange pleasantries with our distinguished guests. 
498,"HYDE: That's all right, Prof. You go and enjoy your nosh. Leave it to"
499,the toiling masses. 
500,"MASTER: Mister Hyde, I have every faith in you. And in you, Doctor."
501,There. 
502,"HYDE: Hey, you'd better get your skates on. The VIP's are arriving."
503,"Escorted by a UNIT jeep, no less. "
504,MASTER: What? 
505,(The Master and Hyde look out of the window as the car and Land Rover
506,draw up near the fallen window cleaner and the Brigadier gets out.) 
507,MASTER: What are they doing here? 
508,HYDE: Military observers. Happens all the time. They're the only ones
509,with enough money for our sort of nonsense. 
510,"MASTER: I see. Doctor Ingram, I've changed my mind. I will set up this"
511,filter myself. 
512,"RUTH: Well, I'm perfectly capable of constructing a simple circuit,"
513,Professor. 
514,MASTER: I am sure that you are equally capable of devouring a tough
515,pheasant on my behalf. 
516,"RUTH: Well, why can't you go and devour it? "
517,"MASTER: Look, Doctor, please. I am lifelong pacifist. Now the"
518,"association of the military with killing, with violence. Please bear"
519,with me. 
520,RUTH: Very well. I'll get them to send some sandwiches across to you. 
521,"HYDE: Good thinking, Batman. We've got a nutcase on our hands."

526,man in a bowler hat and his aide come up.) 
527,COOK: He's not dead? 
528,"BRIGADIER: No, he's still breathing. "
529,COOK: Who is he? 
530,"BRIGADIER: Well, the window cleaner, I presume. He must have fallen off"
531,that ladder. It's a miracle he's still alive. 
532,"COOK: Oh, poor fellow. Well, come along, Proctor. I trust you'll make"
533,the necessary arrangements to get him into hospital. 
534,"(Cook and Proctor leave, Benton comes up. He's back in uniform.) "

545,"pleasure jaunt, you know? "
546,"JO: Sorry, Doctor. "
547,"DOCTOR: Only, if it is the Master, we can't run the risk of losing him."
548,You just keep your eye on the time sensor. 
549,JO: Right. 
550,(It promptly starts working.) 
551,JO: Doctor? 
552,DOCTOR: Yeah? 
553,JO: It's working again. 
554,(The Doctor stops Bessie.) 
555,DOCTOR: What's the bearing? 
556,"JO: Er, oh seven four, and, er, sixteen point three nine miles away. "
557,"DOCTOR: Well, that's Venusian miles. In Earth miles, that's be about"
558,"seventy two point seven nine. Let's take a look at the map. Well, we're"
559,about here. That should put us somewhere around there. A village called
560,Wootton. 
561,"JO: Wootton? Well, that's where the Brigadier and Sergeant Benton are. "
562,"DOCTOR: TOM-TIT? Well, if the Master's behind that. What time's the"
563,demonstration? 
564,JO: Two o'clock. 
565,"DOCTOR: We've got to stop it. Hang on tight, Jo. "

570, (One forty five according to the stable clock and
571,lunch is over.) 
572,"COOK: There you are, Charles. It may seem churlish of me after eating"
573,"your excellent lunch, but how the institute can afford pheasant, I"
574,really don't know.

576, [Newton Institute laboratory]
577,
578," PERCIVAL: We are in the depths of the country, you"
579,know. 
580,"COOK: Be that as it may. We are responsible for international funds,"
581,public money. I doubt very much whether we should allow ourselves the
582,luxury of either pheasants or TOM-TITS. 
583,"RUTH: Well, the Professor doesn't seem to be here, gentlemen. "
584,PERCIVAL: Obviously. 
585,(Hyde comes out of the radiation lab.) 
586,"RUTH: Ah, Stuart. Where's the professor? "
587,HYDE: Search me. He was here a couple of minutes ago. 
588,"COOK: Who is this fellow Thascales, anyway? I've never heard of him. "
589,"PERCIVAL: Oh, an excellent background. Surely you've read his paper on"
590,the granule structure of time? 
591,COOK: All I can do to keep up with the departmental minutes. I leave
592,all the rest to Proctor. 
593,BRIGADIER: That's a fearsome looking load of electronic nonsense you've
594,"got together, Doctor Ingram? How does it all work? In words of one"
595,syllable. 
596,"RUTH: I'll do my best. Well, gentleman, to begin with, time isn't"
597,smooth. It's made up of little bits. 
598,HYDE: A series of minute present moments. 
599,"RUTH: That's it. Temporal atoms, so to speak. So, if one could push"
600,"something through the interstices between them, it would be outside our"
601,space-time continuum altogether. 
602,BRIGADIER: Where would it be then? 
603,"RUTH: Well, nowhere at all in ordinary terms. "
604,"BRIGADIER: You've lost me, Doctor Ingram. "
605,COOK: And me. I've never heard such a farrago of unscientific rubbish
606,in all my life. It's a impossible situation. 
607,HYDE: But we've done it. We shoved that vase through and brought it
608,"back, in there. "
609,"BRIGADIER: But shoved it through where, for goodness sake? "
610,"BENTON: Sort of through the crack between now and now, sir. "
611,"HYDE: Right, you've got it. "
612,BRIGADIER: Well I give up. It's beyond me. 
613,(A figure in a radiation suit and helmet enters.)

622,"faster than yours. Bessie's no ordinary car, remember? "
623,(Bessie comes to a sudden halt at a crossroads.) 
624,DOCTOR: See what I mean? 
625,JO: But why didn't I go through the windscreen? 
626,"DOCTOR: Well, the brakes work by the absorption of inertia, including"
627,yours. 
628,(The time sensor starts up.)

720,DOCTOR: Who is this? 
721,RUTH: My assistant. But Stuart's only twenty five. 
722,DOCTOR: Twenty five? This man's eighty or more. 
723,(Jo enters.)

728,
729,(In another part of the Institute. Ruth removes a
730,thermometer from Hyde's mouth and looks at it. The Brigadier enters.) 
731,BRIGADIER: How is he? 
732,"DOCTOR: Well, what he needs at the moment is rest. We'll get him to the"
733,hospital later. He must have been a pretty tough youngster. 
734,RUTH: He was. 
735,"DOCTOR: Well, lucky for him. Otherwise the shock of the change would"
736,have finished him off. 
737,JO: But will he be all right? 
738,"DOCTOR: Yes, he'll survive. "
739,"RUTH: Yes, but how long for, Doctor? He's an old man. "
740,"BRIGADIER: What caused it, Doctor, some sort of radioactivity? "
741,"DOCTOR: No, it was more than that. "
742,JO: A change in metabolism? 
743,"DOCTOR: Well, that's more like it, Jo, but it still isn't the answer,"
744,even if the metabolic rate had increased a hundredfold. 
745,RUTH: That's impossible. 
746,"DOCTOR: Well, of course it is. Even if it wasn't, the change in him"
747,"would have taken seven or eight months, not eight seconds. "
748,"BRIGADIER: Well, there's only one thing I know which makes people old. "
749,DOCTOR: And that is? 
750,"BRIGADIER: Anno Domini, Doctor. Age, the passing of time. "
751,RUTH: We all know that. 
752,"DOCTOR: Congratulations, Brigadier. I think you've provided the"
753,explanation. 
754,"BRIGADIER: Well, glad to be of service. What did I say? "
755,DOCTOR: The passing of time. That's the only possible answer. Stuart's
756,own personal time speeded up so enormously that his whole physiological
757,life passed by in a moment. But why? How did it happen? 
758,"RUTH: Well, the Professor might know but he seems to have disappeared. "
759,JO: What professor? 
760,RUTH: Professor Thascales. TOM-TIT's his baby. 
761,"DOCTOR: Thascales. Really, the arrogance of that man is beyond belief. "
762,"BRIGADIER: Well, whose arrogance? Doctor, I wish you wouldn't talk in"
763,riddles. 
764,"DOCTOR: Perhaps a classical education would have helped you, Brigadier."
765,Thascales is a Greek word. 
766,JO: Thascales? I get it. Thascales is Greek for Master. 
767,"DOCTOR: Right, Jo. "

890,this about? 
891,"DOCTOR: Well, it'll be difficult to accept, I warn you. "
892,"RUTH: Well, try me. "
893,"DOCTOR: Well, luckily you are already familiar with the idea of"

916,
917, RUTH: But Kronos was a Greek legend. He was the
918,"Titan who ate his children, wasn't he? "
919,"DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. And what's more, one of those children in the"
920,"legend was Poseidon, the god of Atlantis. "
921,RUTH: Are you trying to tell us that the classical gods are real? 
922,"DOCTOR: Well, yes and no. Extraordinary people, the Atlanteans, you"
923,know. Even more extraordinary than their cousins in Athens. Once
924,"reality became unbearable for them, they would invent a legend to tame"
925,it.

927,"DOCTOR: Quite so. Kronos, a living creature, was drawn at a time by the"
928,"priests of Atlantis, using that crystal as its centre. "
929,"RUTH: You mean, that that crystal is the original? The actual crystal"
930,from Atlantis? 
931,"DOCTOR: It is, and your friend the professor, is trying to use that"
932,"crystal, as it was used four thousand years ago, to capture the"
933,Kronavore. 
934,RUTH: So that's what you meant when you talked of terrible danger. 
935,"BENTON: Danger to us, you mean, Doctor, or to the whole world? "
936,"DOCTOR: Not just danger to our world, Sergeant, or even our galaxy, but"
937,to the entire created universe.

939, [Director's office]
940,
941, PERCIVAL: But suppose somebody should walk in here
942,now and find me talking to you. 
943,"MASTER: Oh dear, you are a worrier, aren't you. Come here. Closer. Now"
944,look into my eyes. There is nothing to worry about. Everything will be
945,all right if you just obey me. Just obey me. 
946,PERCIVAL: Obey. I must obey. Everything will be all right. 
947,MASTER: That's better. Now you go along there and carry along with your
948,"telephoning, and let me get on with my sums. You know, it's a long time"
949,since I came across a hypnotic subject who turned out to be as good as
950,you are. It's just like old times.
951,
952, [Newton Institute laboratory]
953,
954, DOCTOR: There are two things I don't quite
955,"understand, though. One is the massive power build up that you had, and"
956,the second is the strength of the signal that I received on the time
957,sensor. 
958,"RUTH: Yes, but you said yourself it picks up all time field"
959,disturbances. 
960,"DOCTOR: Yes, indeed it does. The strength of the signal was far too"
961,strong for an apparatus as crude as this. However. Ah. 
962,"BENTON: Well, what is it, Doctor? "
963,"DOCTOR: Yes. Well, I thought it would be around here somewhere. "
964,(The Doctor points to a large mainframe computer unit that fills a
965,whole wall.) 
966,"DOCTOR: This, Sergeant, is the Master's Tardis."
967,
968, [Director's office]
969,
970, MASTER: E to the power of seven C. E equals MC
971,cubed. 
972,"PERCIVAL: Squared. (into phone) Er, yes, thank you. At once. "
973,MASTER: What? 
974,"PERCIVAL: E equals MC squared, not cubed. "
975,"MASTER: Not in the extra-temporal physics of the time vortex. Oh dear,"
976,"now you've made me lose my place. You're an interfering dolt, Percival."
977,
978,PERCIVAL: I am sorry. What are you doing? 
979,"MASTER: Oh dear, I am trying to find out why we had that massive power"
980,"build-up. It makes the whole experiment uncontrollable, even the filter"
981,"didn't prevent it and logically, it just shouldn't happen."
982,
983, [Newton Institute laboratory]
984,
985," DOCTOR: Logically, it just shouldn't happen. "
986,RUTH: But it did. 
987,"DOCTOR: Yes, indeed it did. So, there's only one thing left for us to"
988,"do. Wouldn't you agree, Sergeant? "
989,"BENTON: Oh, yes, sure. What, for instance? "
990,"DOCTOR: Switch on, and take a look for ourselves. "
991,RUTH: Right. 
992,DOCTOR: It's reading ten already. 
993,RUTH: But that's impossible! 
994,"BENTON: Doctor? Doctor, the crystal's glowing."
995,

997,
998," DOCTOR: Sergeant, now you're a strong young man."
999,"Go in there and pick up that crystal, will you? "
1000,"BENTON: Doctor, Stuart was "
1001,DOCTOR: It's perfectly safe at this low level. Believe me. 
1002,"BENTON: If you say so, Doctor. "
1003,DOCTOR: I do. 
1004,(Benton goes over to the machine and takes hold of the crystal.) 
1005,BENTON: It's fixed down. 
1006,"DOCTOR: No, it isn't, you know. You can see it isn't. "
1007,"BENTON: Well, I can't shift it. "
1008,"DOCTOR: No. No, of course you can't. And do you know why you can't"
1009,shift it? Because that crystal isn't really here at all. It's made the
1010,jump through interstitial time. It must to be linked to that other
1011,crystal all those thousands of years ago. Or rather it is the other
1012,crystal. 
1013,RUTH: But then where is the original one? 
1014,"DOCTOR: Where do you think? In Atlantis, of course."

1032,"BENTON: Sergeant Benton? Ah, hello, Miss Grant. Yeah. Yeah, he's here."
1033,"Oh, I see. Look, hang on a sec. Doctor? "
1034,(The Doctor enters.) 
1035,"BENTON: Doctor, it's Jo. She says Stuart Hyde's coming to. He's in a"
1036,"bit of a state, it seems. "
1037,"DOCTOR: All right. Tell her that I'm on my way. You'd better stay here,"
1038,Sergeant. 
1039,BENTON: Right. 
1040,"DOCTOR: Coming, Ruth? Er, Doctor Ingram? "

1050,"JO: Oh lor, I'm forgetting my patient. See you, Sergeant. "
1051,HYDE: Kronos. 
1052,JO: Are you all right? 
1053,HYDE: I felt him coming back. 
1054,JO: Who? 
1055,"HYDE: Kronos. Oh, don't let him touch me. "
1056,JO: It's all right. You're all right. 
1057,"HYDE: Oh, I'm burning. I'm burning. "
1058,"JO: You're quite safe, honestly. Shush, shush. You're safe. "
1059,HYDE: Who are you? 
1060,JO: I'm Jo. 
1061,"HYDE: Oh, where am I? "
1062,JO: You're in your own room. 
1063,"HYDE: Oh, I've got the granddaddy of all hangovers. My hands. What's"
1064,happened to my hands? 
1065,"JO: It's all right. It's all right, honestly. It's a difficult thing to"
1066,
1067,HYDE: A mirror. 
1068,JO: There isn't one. 
1069,HYDE: Give me a mirror. 
1070,"JO: Please, I'll get you one later. Come on, now just lie down and "

1080,"MASTER: Yes, at last. Now, back to the laboratory. "
1081,"PERCIVAL: Yes, well, they'll have somebody on guard. "
1082,"MASTER: Oh, yes. You don't happen to know who it is, do you? "
1083,"PERCIVAL: Yes, a Sergeant Benton, I think. "
1084,"MASTER: Really? Well, I think I know how to deal with him."

1086, [Hyde's apartment]
1087,
1088, HYDE: It was just after the cup and saucer
1089,appeared. I was about to switch off when it happened. 
1090,"DOCTOR: Go on, old chap. Go on, you're doing fine. "
1091,"HYDE: Like a tongue of flame. All my body was on fire. All my life, all"
1092,"my energy, was being sucked out of me. "
1093,DOCTOR: Why did you say Kronos? 
1094,HYDE: Because that's who it was. 
1095,DOCTOR: How did you know? 
1096,HYDE: I just knew. 
1097,RUTH: You mean you heard a voice or something? 
1098,"HYDE: No, I just knew. "
1099,DOCTOR: It's a race memory. We all have them. 
1100,JO: But what is Kronos? Or should I say who? 
1101,"DOCTOR: Later, Jo, later. Go on, Stuart, what else? "
1102,"HYDE: Nothing else until I woke up here. Doc, am I really an old man?"
1103,"Is there nothing you can do, or am I stuck like this? "

1110,BENTON: Hello? 
1111,PERCIVAL : Hello. Is that Sergeant Benton? 
1112,BENTON: Yes. 
1113,PERCIVAL : This is the director. The Brigadier wishes to see you
1114,back at the house. 
1115,BENTON: But I don't get it. The Brigadier wants me back at the house? 
1116,"PERCIVAL : Yes, that's right. At once. "
1117,"BENTON: Yes, but that means leaving the lab unwatched."
1118,
1119, [Director's office]
1120,
1121," PERCIVAL: Oh, but he said to be sure to lock up."
1122,Those were his very words.
1123,
1124,  [Newton Institute laboratory]
1125,
1126," BENTON: I don't know, Doctor Percival. I mean,"
1127,you've put me in a bit of a spot. The Brigadier told me to stay here no
1128,matter what happened. He'll have my stripes if I don't.
1129,
1130, [Director's office]
1131,
1132, PERCIVAL: One minute. 
1133,MASTER: What's the matter? 
1134,PERCIVAL: I don't think he believes me. 
1135,MASTER: I'm not surprised. I've never seen a more inept performance.
1136,"Look, tell him to ring the Brigadier for confirmation. "
1137,PERCIVAL: But you can't 
1138,MASTER: Do as I tell you! 
1139,PERCIVAL: Sergeant Benton? I suggest you check with Brigadier Stewart
1140,"yourself. Er, oh, you want his number? Er. "
1141,(The Master picks up the second extension telephone for Percival to
1142,read the number.) 
1143,"PERCIVAL: Oh yes, I think you can contact him on five three four. Yeah."
1144,"Yes, that's right."
1145,
1146, [Newton Institute laboratory]
1147,
1148, PERCIVAL : Goodbye. 
1149,BENTON: Goodbye.

1151, [Director's office]

1153, (The Master answers the second telephone with a
1154,perfect imitation of the Brigadier.) 
1155,MASTER: Lethbridge Stewart? 
1156,"BENTON : Hello, Sergeant Benton here, sir. "
1157,"MASTER: Ah, Benton. "
1158,"BENTON: Sir, I've just had the most peculiar phone call. "
1159,"MASTER: Nothing peculiar about it, my dear fellow. Perfectly simple. I"
1160,"need you over here, on the double. "
1161,"BENTON : Right, sir. "
1162,(Benton opens a sash window in the laboratory then goes out of the main
1163,door.) 
1164,MASTER: Well? 
1165,"PERCIVAL: No sign of him. Do you think he really will. Ah, there he is."
1166,
1167,"(Benton walks through the archway and past Bessie, away from the main"
1168,block.) 
1169,PERCIVAL: It worked! It really worked! 
1170,MASTER: Of course it worked. Now see if the corridor's clear. 
1171,"PERCIVAL: Not a soul, Professor."
1172,
1173, [Newton Institute laboratory]
1174,
1175, (Benton walks round the stable block then gets up
1176,onto the flat roof near the laboratory window. From there he climbs
1177,across to the open window and goes into the lab. He crosses the room
1178,and looks out at the main block in time to see Percival and the Master
1179,come out. Benton draws his pistol and hides behind TOM-TIT as he hears
1180,voices in the corridor. Percival and the Master enter.) 
1181,PERCIVAL: These are trying times. 
1182,"MASTER: Time? Soon I shall have the time in the world, literally. "
1183,"PERCIVAL: In an hour or so, the place will be swarming with soldiers. "
1184,"MASTER: Doctor Percival, you're beginning to irritate me. Now do be"
1185,quiet. I tell you that nobody and nothing can stop me now. 
1186,(Benton sneaks round the machinery and then comes out in front of the
1187,door.) 
1188,"BENTON: Put your hands in the air, both of you. Get them up. Now turn"
1189,around slowly. Slowly. 
1190,"MASTER: Well, well, well. The resourceful Sergeant Benton. "
1191,BENTON: You didn't really think you could fool me with a fake telephone
1192,"call, did you? It's the oldest trick in the book. "
1193,"MASTER: I underestimated you, Sergeant. How did you know? "
1194,BENTON: Simple. The Brigadier's not in the habit of calling Sergeants
1195,my dear fellow. 
1196,MASTER: Ah. The tribal taboos of army etiquette. I find it difficult to
1197,identify with such primitive absurdities. 
1198,"BENTON: Yes, well, primitive or not, mate, you're still in the soup"
1199,"without a ladle, aren't you. "
1200,"MASTER: Now, Sergeant, you must let me explain. "
1201,BENTON: Keep back! Keep back. 
1202,"MASTER: Yes, of course. "
1203,BENTON: Keep back. 
1204,"MASTER: Of course, Sergeant. You see, Sergeant Benton, the whole point"
1205,is that. Doctor! What a very timely 
1206,"(Benton looks behind him and the Master grabs his gun arm, making him"
1207,drop the pistol and throwing him to the floor. Benton hits his head
1208,against a filing cabinet and is out for the count.) 
1209,"MASTER: You're wrong, Sergeant Benton. That is the oldest trick in the"
1210,book. 
1211,PERCIVAL: What are you going to do? 
1212,MASTER: I am going to bring somebody here who can help me find the
1213,"power that I need. Without it, I am helpless. "
1214,(The Master starts to operate TOM-TIT.) 
1215,PERCIVAL: I don't understand. 
1216,MASTER: Of course you don't understand! How could you possibly
1217,understand? Only one thing stands between me and complete power over
1218,"the Earth, over the universe itself. Now the one I bring here will show"
1219,"me how to harness that power. Now, you watch that crystal! "

1244,MASTER: Poseidon? But surely Kronos is your lord? 
1245,"KRASIS: You would dare profane, with your irreverent tongue, the great"
1246,"secret, the mystery which no man dare speak? Who are you? "
1247,MASTER: I am the Master. Lord of time and ruler of Kronos. 
1248,KRASIS: You are lying! No one rules Kronos!

1258,KRASIS: Is this the abode of lord Kronos? 
1259,"MASTER: No, but with you to assist me, I shall bring him here. "
1260,KRASIS: I exist only to do his will. He is not to be commanded. 
1261,"MASTER: Oh, but surely Kronos obeyed the priests of Kronos as a pet dog"
1262,obeys his master? 
1263,KRASIS: You 
1264,"MASTER: The truth, Krasis? "
1265,KRASIS: It is so written. 
1266,"MASTER: Ah. Well, therefore you have the secret. You have the formula. "
1267,"KRASIS: No, it is lost. For five centuries it has been lost to"
1268,Atlantis. 
1269,MASTER: Was nothing handed down? 
1270,KRASIS: Nothing. 
1271,MASTER: Nothing at all? 
1272,"KRASIS: Nothing, save the crystal and the seal of the high priest. "
1273,"MASTER: But that's it! From this seal, I can learn the true constants!"

1295,a vertical dividing line down the middle of the seal.) 
1296,PERCIVAL: But how can Atlantean measurements mean anything to you? 
1297,MASTER: Comparative ratios remain constant throughout time. If you have
1298,"nothing intelligent to say, do please keep quiet. Right. Now we switch"

1332,(The Master holds up the seal and Kronos backs away.)

1380, MASTER: Thank you for your help. 
1381,KRASIS: I am no slave that I should serve you. I serve only the gods. 
1382,"MASTER: You'll serve me, Krasis, and you'll like it. "
1383,KRASIS: You dare mock the high priest? 
1384,"MASTER: Take care. I can always bring Kronos back, you know. "
1385,"KRASIS: No! No, I beseech you. What is your will? "
1386,MASTER: Knowledge. Your knowledge of the ancient mysteries. Why could I
1387,not control him? 
1388,"KRASIS: For all your sorcery, you are as a child trying to control a"
1389,rogue elephant. A puny child. 
1390,MASTER: But I have the crystal. 
1391,KRASIS: That crystal is but a part of the true crystal of Kronos. A
1392,small fraction. 
1393,MASTER: Fraction? And the rest is in Atlantis? 
1394,"KRASIS: Deep in the vaults of the temple of Poseidon, guarded by night"
1395,and by day from such thieves as you. You may command the slave but
1396,never shall you command the Mighty One himself. 
1397,MASTER: You think not? We shall see.

1401, (The young man returns to the altar with a white
1402,haired old man.) 
1403,"HIPPIAS: Do you see, most venerable king? The crystal has gone. "
1404,DALIOS: And Krasis? 
1405,HIPPIAS: I was here. The sky opened and a sphere of fire hurled by the
1406,hand of Zeus 
1407,"DALIOS: Yes, yes, yes, I saw the thunderstorm myself. What next? "
1408,"HIPPIAS: They disappeared, Krasis and the crystal together like smoke."
1409,"What does it mean, Lord Dalios? Has the time come at last? "
1410,"DALIOS: You are young, Hippias. As young in years as in the sacred"
1411,mysteries. What do you know of Kronos? 
1412,HIPPIAS: The years of Kronos were the golden years of Atlantis. Perhaps
1413,he will return to us. 
1414,DALIOS: That is my fear. Our world is in great danger. Come!
1415,
1416, [Temple Undercroft]
1417,
1418," DALIOS: How old would you think me, boy? "
1419,"HIPPIAS: A great age, Dalios. "
1420,DALIOS: How great? 
1421,"HIPPIAS: Four score years or more, perhaps. "
1422,"DALIOS: A stripling of eighty summers? No, Hippias, when these eyes"
1423,"were clear like yours, I saw the building of the temple. I was a"
1424,witness at the enthronement of the image of the great god Poseidon
1425,himself. 
1426,"HIPPIAS: But, that was, well, it must have been five hundred years ago."
1427,
1428,DALIOS: Five hundred and thirty seven. 
1429,"HIPPIAS: Dalios, will you have me believe you are "
1430,DALIOS: I am. 
1431,(Dalios unbolts a large wooden door and opens it. A bright light shine
1432,inside.) 
1433,"HIPPIAS: What is it, that light? "
1434,DALIOS: It is the light of true crystal of Kronos. This is the great
1435,"secret, the veritable mystery. But now that Krasis has gone, you alone"
1436,know the secret. You must guard it with your life. 
1437,"HIPPIAS: I shall, my lord. "
1438,(The sound of a bull bellowing comes from the room.) 
1439,"DALIOS: There is nothing to fear, it is the guardian. Return to your"
1440,"rest! It is I, Dalios! "
1441,(Dalios closes the door and bolts it again.) 
1442,"HIPPIAS: What, who was it? You said no other person shares the great"
1443,mystery. 
1444,"DALIOS: The guardian is a person no longer. A thing, a creature, too"
1445,"horrible to imagine. Half man, half beast. Come."

1448,
1449," HYDE: Make yourselves comfortable, if you can. "
1450,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
1451,"BRIGADIER: All right, Doctor, go on. What next. Having picked us all up"
1452,"by the scruff of the neck and bundled us all in here, what do you"
1453,propose to do with us? 
1454,DOCTOR: Nothing at all. There's nothing to be done except wait. 
1455,JO: I seem to have heard that before. 
1456,"DOCTOR: Speaking personally, I'd love a cup of tea. How about it,"
1457,Stuart? 
1458,"HYDE: I'll put the kettle on. Hey, Ruth, get the mugs out. "
1459,RUTH: Right. 
1460,"HYDE: How about a sandwich? Only marmalade, I'm afraid. "
1461,"BENTON: I'd love one, please. "
1462,BRIGADIER: This isn't a picnic. One moment you're talking about the
1463,"entire universe blowing up, and the next you're going on about tea."
1464,Doctor! What's happening? 
1465,"DOCTOR: A great deal. For instance, you, Brigadier, you were caught in"
1466,a hiatus in time. Being without becoming. An ontological absurdity. 
1467,BRIGADIER: I don't understand a word you're saying. 
1468,"JO: Well, it's true. You and Benton and Doctor Ingram, well, you were,"
1469,you were stuck. 
1470,"BRIGADIER: Nothing of the sort, Miss Grant. "
1471,"DOCTOR: Well, you wouldn't be aware of it, of course, because your time"
1472,had slowed down too. 
1473,BENTON: And all because of this TOM-TIT gadget? 
1474,"DOCTOR: Yes, so it would seem. After all, it did make a crack in time,"
1475,didn't it? 
1476,JO: A what? 
1477,"BRIGADIER: Oh, a gap between the now and the now, as Sergeant Benton"
1478,put it. 
1479,"DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. We're bound to experience all kinds of freak side"
1480,effects. 
1481,"RUTH: You mean, even leaving Kronos and the crystal right out of it? "
1482,DOCTOR: Correct. 
1483,RUTH: Marmalade sandwich? 
1484,"DOCTOR: No, thank you. Jo? "
1485,"RUTH: Well, why weren't we affected when we were actually working the"
1486,"machine? I mean, we weren't slowed down. "
1487,"DOCTOR: Well, you stand right under a fountain, you don't necessarily"
1488,"get wet, do you? "
1489,"RUTH: Oh, I see. "
1490,"BRIGADIER: Well, I'm dashed if I do. Doctor, what are you doing? "
1491,DOCTOR: Me? Collecting.

1497,into his usual black suit and gloves.) 
1498,MASTER: Right! Now we shall soon be ready to move. 
1499,"KRASIS: Master, he may return. The Mighty One may return. "
1500,"MASTER: Oh, fortunate Atlantis, to be blessed with such a courageous"
1501,high priest. Never fear. Kronos will only return if I desire it. 
1502,KRASIS: But the crystal. 
1503,"MASTER: I am reversing the interstitial flow, thus draining the time"
1504,"energy from the crystal. Otherwise, we couldn't take it with us. "
1505,KRASIS: We? Where are we going? 
1506,"MASTER: Where do you think? Atlantis, of course."

1511,keys and a couple of other things onto the bed.) 
1512,"DOCTOR: Well, he must be stopped. "
1513,BRIGADIER: Fair enough. Why don't we get on with it? 
1514,DOCTOR: Because we can't even find out what he's up to without the
1515,Tardis. A bottle. I need a bottle. 
1516,HYDE: How about this? 
1517,(A milk bottle) 
1518,"DOCTOR: No, no, that won't do. One with a narrow neck. A wine bottle. "
1519,"HYDE: Moroccan burgundy, for instance? "
1520,"DOCTOR: Yes, that'll do nicely. "
1521,HYDE: There we are. 
1522,DOCTOR: Fine. And the cork? 
1523,"HYDE: Oh, you've got me there, I'm afraid. "
1524,"RUTH: How about this, Stu? "
1525,"HYDE: Oh, remarkable efficiency. Still on the corkscrew. "
1526,DOCTOR: Well done. 
1527,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, I must insist. What are you up to? "
1528,"DOCTOR: Delaying tactics, Brigadier. A small fly in the Master's"
1529,metaphorical ointment.
1530,
1531, [Newton Institute laboratory]
1532,

1538, (The wine bottle has a cork back in it with a
1539,bodkin needle sticking up out of it. The Doctor is putting two forks
1540,into another cork.) 
1541,"DOCTOR: Do give me a fork, Jo, will you? "
1542,(The Doctor puts the second cork on the needle.) 
1543,"DOCTOR: Right. So far, so good. "
1544,RUTH: Another nutcase. 
1545,HYDE: Fruit cake standard.

1553,"KRASIS: No! No, I dare not. "
1554,"MASTER: But there's nothing to be afraid of, I promise you. Do as I"
1555,tell you.

1561,with the napkin ring holding its arms up and an upturned ashtray at the
1562,top with key fobs below. The Doctor hangs sets of rings off the forks.)
1563,
1564,BRIGADIER: And what's that meant to be? 
1565,"DOCTOR: You're a philistine, Brigadier. It's not meant to be anything."
1566,It just is. I hope. 
1567,RUTH: You mean it's just a ridiculous piece of modern art? 
1568,"DOCTOR: No, certainly not. It's a time flow analogue. "
1569,"HYDE: Of course it is, Ruth. You should have seen that at a glance. "
1570,DOCTOR: The relationships between the different molecular bonds and the
1571,actual shapes form a crystalline structure of ratios. 
1572,"BRIGADIER: Does this make any sort of sense, Doctor Ingram? "
1573,RUTH: None whatsoever. 
1574,"BRIGADIER: Just as I thought. Doctor, please stop this silly game at"
1575,once. 
1576,"DOCTOR: Patience, Brigadier, patience. Now then, here goes. "

1580,"DOCTOR: Well, it doesn't work. "
1581,BRIGADIER: You astound me. 
1582,"HYDE: Bad luck, Doc. Have a cup of tea and drown your sorrows. "
1583,"DOCTOR: Thank you. Tea! Yes, of course. Tea leaves. "
1584,(The Doctor empties the mug and places it on top of the ashtray.)

1609," JO: But what does it do? I mean, how does it"
1610,actually affect the Master's plans. 
1611,"DOCTOR: Well, it's just like jamming a radio signal, Jo. We used to"
1612,make them at school to spoil each other's time experiments. 
1613,RUTH: I don't believe it. I just don't believe it.

1629,Doctor's Tardis here double quick. Out.

1633,MASTER: I will show you greater wonders than either. 
1634,"KRASIS: Master Lord, you will not bring the Mighty One here once more. "

1644,(The convoy scatters onto the fields either side of the road as the
1645,knight gallops off down the road.)

1824,the Tardis upright. The Doctor takes Jo to Bessie and hands her the
1825,time detector.) 
1826,"DOCTOR: Right, Jo, I want you to keep a close eye on this. As soon as"
1827,"you see the slightest reaction, you let me know. "
1828,JO: Right. 
1829,"FARMER: One, two, six, heave! One, two, six, heave! Pull!"
1830,
1831, [Hyde's apartment]
1832,
1833," BENTON: Sir, I'll stand by. And I'm glad you're"
1834,"all okay, sir. We'd really thought you'd copped it. Greyhound "
1835,HYDE: It's a daft idea anyway. I've had one basinful and I don't feel
1836,much like walking into another. You heard what the Doctor said. 
1837,"RUTH: You know, Stuart, for a so-called member of the dominant sex, you"
1838,are being remarkable feeble. 
1839,"BENTON: Hey, hey! Is this a private fight or can anyone join in? "
1840,RUTH: Boadicea here only wants to creep over to the lab and knobble the
1841,Master. 
1842,"BENTON: Well, supposing the time field's still working? "
1843,HYDE: Exactly. 
1844,"RUTH: Well we shan't know that till we try it, now shall we. "
1845,BENTON: Right then. What are we waiting for? 
1846,RUTH: Right! 
1847,"HYDE: Oy, you're worse than she is. "
1848,"BENTON: Oh, you're suggesting we just sit here and let the Master treat"
1849,"us as a load of twits, I suppose? "
1850,"HYDE: Look, mate, you're paid to play the James Bond games. I'm a"
1851,scientist. 
1852,"RUTH: Stuart, really. "
1853,HYDE: Don't you start. You'd be the first to clobber me if I muck
1854,things up. 
1855,"RUTH: Well, you might at least have a go. Oh, why are you men so"
1856,spineless? 
1857,"HYDE: Lovey, I'm not men. I'm Stuart Hyde, registered, card carrying,"
1858,"paid up coward. For Pete's sake, what are you looking at me like that"
1859,"for? All right, I'll come. "
1860,"BENTON: Thanks, Stuart. "
1861,"RUTH: Jolly good, Stu. I knew you wouldn't let us down. "
1862,"HYDE: Just give me time, that's all. Well, come on then. What are we"
1863,waiting for? 
1864,(Hyde picks up a large spanner.) 
1865,BENTON: Let's go.
1866,
1867, [Newton Institute laboratory]
1868,
1869," MASTER: Come, Krasis. We have work to do. "
1870,(The Master takes the module containing the crystal into his Tardis.)
1871,
1872, [The Master's Tardis]
1873,
1874, (And places it on a smoked glass table.) 
1875,"KRASIS: Master, what is this place? Is it a temple? "
1876,"MASTER: Do not let it concern you, Krasis. "
1877,KRASIS: So vast a space inside so small a box. 
1878,MASTER: My power is greater than your imagination can encompass. You
1879,just remember that. Your only interest at the moment is to realise that
1880,"Atlantis awaits us. Now, test the power levels. Good. Just a few"
1881,minutes re-cycling and we shall be ready to leave. 
1882,(The Master leaves his time rotor blinking.)
1883,
1884, [Copse]
1885,
1886, JO: I'm getting a reading. 
1887,DOCTOR: It's very low. 
1888,"JO: Mmm, it's fading again. "
1889,DOCTOR: He must be testing before take off. The power drain would have
1890,been enormous. Brigadier? 
1891,"BRIGADIER: Yes, Doctor? "
1892,DOCTOR: The Master seems to be on the move again. 
1893,"BRIGADIER: Right, Sergeant, get the Doctor's machine loaded up. "
1894,"DOCTOR: No, no, there's no time for that now. I'll have to take the"
1895,Tardis off from down there. I'll use the time sensor as a homing device
1896,"and put my Tardis inside his. Then wherever he goes, I'll go with him. "
1897,"(The Doctor and Jo go down into the crater, which has vehicle wheels"
1898,scattered around.) 
1899,"DOCTOR: Well, goodbye, Lethbridge Stewart. "
1900,BRIGADIER: Bye. 
1901,DOCTOR: I'll make contact as soon as possible. 
1902,JO: We'll make contact as soon as possible. 
1903,DOCTOR: We? 
1904,JO: We. 
1905,DOCTOR: Nothing I can say to dissuade you? 
1906,JO: No. 
1907,DOCTOR: Oh.
1908,
1909, [Tardis]
1910,
1911, JO: Doctor? 
1912,DOCTOR: Yeah? 
1913,JO: The Tardis looks different. 
1914,(The old roundels have been replaced by large plastic dishes.) 
1915,"DOCTOR: Oh, just a spot of redecoration, that's all. Now, Jo, you"
1916,realise that what I'm about to do is going to be appallingly dangerous.
1917,
1918,JO: I've been in the Tardis with you before. 
1919,"DOCTOR: All right, but you've been warned. "
1920,JO: Shall I take your coat? 
1921,"DOCTOR: Thank you. Right. Now then, come over here and look at this. "
1922,"JO: Yeah, I'm coming. "
1923,"DOCTOR: Now, the two Tardis's are operating on the same frequency, you"
1924,see? Now here comes the tricky part. You see this? 
1925,JO: Yeah. 
1926,DOCTOR: This is the time setting. Now it's critical to a billionth part
1927,"of a nanosecond, do you see? "
1928,JO: Yeah. 
1929,"DOCTOR: Now hold this. (the time detector) If it's infinitesimally low,"
1930,we'll miss it entirely and goes whistling off to heaven knows where.
1931,"But if it's too high, even by a fraction of a moment, whumph! Time ram."
1932,
1933,JO: Time ram? 
1934,"DOCTOR: Yes. You see, the atoms making up this Tardis would occupy"
1935,precisely the same space and time as the atoms making up the Master's
1936,Tardis. 
1937,JO: But that's impossible! 
1938,"DOCTOR: Yes, well of course it is. So what do you think would happen? "
1939,JO: Whumph! 
1940,"DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Extinction. Utter annihilation. Now do you still"
1941,want to come? 
1942,"JO: It is my job, remember? "
1943,"DOCTOR: Glad to have you aboard, Miss Grant. "
1944,"JO: Glad to be aboard, Doctor!"
1945,
1946, [Copse]
1947,
1948, (The Tardis dematerialises. The soldiers don't bat
1949,an eyelid.) 
1950,FARMER: Londoners! 
1951,"(Meanwhile, back at the Institute, Benton, Ruth and Stuart run through"
1952,the shrubbery and into a rhododendron bush near the laboratory block.) 
1953, [Tardis]
1954,
1955, (The Doctor checks the console readings.) 
1956,"DOCTOR: Ah ha. Yes. Yes, so far, so good. "
1957,JO: How long's it going to take us to get there? 
1958,"DOCTOR: Well, that's the curious thing. No time at all. We're outside"
1959,"time. Of course, it always seems to take a long time but that depends"
1960,"upon the mood, I suppose. "
1961,"JO: What, your mood? "
1962,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, hers. No, the Tardis's. "
1963,JO: You talk as if she was alive. 
1964,"DOCTOR: It depends what you mean by alive, doesn't it. You take old"
1965,"Bessie, for instance. Right, coming in to land now, Jo. "
1966,(The Tardis materialises with a jerk.) 
1967,DOCTOR: Steady. 
1968,(A large mainframe computer is inside the console room.) 
1969,JO: Look! 
1970,"DOCTOR: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Still, that was always on the cards."
1971,I suppose. 
1972,"JO: His Tardis is inside ours instead of, well, the other way round. "
1973,"DOCTOR: Yes, quite. Very curious effect that. I wonder how it happened?"
1974,"Jo, switch on the monitor, will you? Let's see where we are. "
1975,(One of the new roundels lights up red.) 
1976,"DOCTOR: Well, that's strange. No, of course. We're seeing through the"
1977,"TOM-TIT gap into the time vortex. Jo, you wait right here."
1978,
1979, [The Master's Tardis]
1980,
1981, (The Doctor walks out of the police box.) 
1982,"DOCTOR: Good grief. Jo, come out here a moment, will you? "
1983,JO: I don't get it. 
1984,DOCTOR: No? Follow me. 
1985,(The Doctor opens the doors and walks into)
1986,
1987, [Tardis]
1988,
1989, JO: I still don't get it. 
1990,"DOCTOR: Well, it's perfectly simple, Jo. My Tardis is inside the"
1991,Master's. 
1992,"JO: Yes, but his is inside yours. "
1993,"DOCTOR: Exactly. They're both inside each other. Yeah, I should have"
1994,suspected that. 
1995,"JO: Well, what are we going to do now? "
1996,DOCTOR: Three guesses? 
1997,"JO: Er, I wonder. Wait? "
1998,DOCTOR: Right first time!
1999,
2000, [Newton Institute laboratory]
2001,
2002, (The Master is noting down readings on a clipboard
2003,"while Krasis paces, then looks out the window.) "
2004,KRASIS: Master! 
2005,(Two UNIT vehicles arrive.) 
2006,KRASIS: Alien wagons! 
2007,MASTER: I'll soon fix them. 
2008,(The Master starts up TOM-TIT.)

2010, [Outside the Institute]
2011,
2012, BRIGADIER: Right. B squad round the block. Keep
2013,your eyes open

2015,stop.)
2016,
2017, [Newton Institute laboratory]
2018,
2019, MASTER: There. That'll keep them nicely unoccupied
2020,"for the time being. Right, Krasis, in you go. "
2021,KRASIS: Where? 
2022,"MASTER: Into the Tardis, man, and hurry up. "
2023,(Ruth and Stuart enter.) 
2024,"MASTER: Right, they won't stop me now. "
2025,"RUTH: I'm sorry, Professor, but that's where you're wrong. "
2026,"(Benton has presumably come in through the back window, and has his"
2027,pistol pointed at the Master.) 
2028,"MASTER: Well, well, my devoted assistants. And are you going to stop"
2029,me? 
2030,"RUTH: Not by ourselves, no. Take a look behind you. "
2031,"MASTER: Oh, come on, really. "
2032,"BENTON: You suit yourself, mate, but let's just have those hands up in"
2033,"the air, shall we? "
2034,MASTER: I should have disposed of you while I had the chance. 
2035,"BENTON: Yes, well, you'll never have a better one. Stu, see if he's got"
2036,a gun. 
2037,(Stuart puts his spanner down on TOM-TIT and gets between Benton and
2038,the Master. The Master pushes him at Benton.) 
2039,"BENTON: Stuart, look out! "
2040,HYDE: Oh no! (The Master dashes into his Tardis.)
2041,
2042, [The Master's Tardis]
2043,
2044, (The Tardis doors close.) 
2045,KRASIS: Master! The other one is here. Your enemy is here. 
2046,MASTER: Good! Ha ha! Now I've got him really trapped.
2047,
2048,[Newton Institute laboratory]
2049,
2050, (The Master's Tardis dematerialises.) 
2051,HYDE: What the?
2052,
2053,[Tardis]
2054,
2055, (The Tardis is tilted and shaking.) 
2056,"JO: What's happening, Doctor? "
2057,"DOCTOR: We're on our way, Jo. The Master's taken off for Atlantis. "
2058,JO: She's never behaved like this before. 
2059,"DOCTOR: It's because the Tardis is operating out of phase, that's why. "
2060,(The Doctor adjusts a few controls and the flight smoothes out.) 
2061,DOCTOR: That's calmed her down a bit. She's very temperamental when
2062,"she's roused, isn't she. "
2063,"JO: You know, I never know whether you're joking or not, I, Ow. Oh, I"
2064,think I've bruised my tailbone. 
2065,"DOCTOR: Sorry about your coccyx, Jo, but these little things are sent"
2066,to try us. 
2067,JO: My what? 
2068,DOCTOR: Coccyx. Your tailbone. 
2069,"MASTER [on scanner]: I'm sorry about your coccyx too, Miss Grant. How"
2070,very sociable of you both to drop in.
2071,
2072, [Newton Institute laboratory]
2073,
2074," BENTON: Well, I don't think we should touch it. "
2075,RUTH: Why ever not? 
2076,"BENTON: Well, the Doctor was going after his Tardis, right? "
2077,RUTH: Right. 
2078,"BENTON: Well, that thing there is a sort of time machine, isn't it? "
2079,RUTH: So what? 
2080,BENTON: So we'd better leave well alone. 
2081,"RUTH: You're in command, Sergeant Benton. "
2082,BENTON: Yes. 
2083,"HYDE: And a right foul up you made of it, too. "
2084,"RUTH: Well, not exactly his fault. "
2085,"HYDE: Well, don't look at me. You can't say I didn't warn you, now can"
2086,you? 
2087,"BENTON: Oh well, I'll listen to you next time. That was the closest"
2088,"I'll ever come to catching the Master, that was. "
2089,"HYDE: Oh, come on now. It's not the end of the world, now is it? "
2090,"BENTON: Isn't it? Well, the Doctor seems to think it might be. And the"
2091,"Master. Well, there's no telling where he is by now, is there? Or when"
2092,"he is, for that matter. "
2093,"RUTH: Oh, for pity's sake. Look, you two make me sick. Standing about"
2094,moaning like a couple of old women. 
2095,HYDE: Old women? 
2096,"RUTH: Look, I mean it, Stu. Well, okay, he's gone off somewhere. So"
2097,he's gone off. Whether he's gone into the past or the future 
2098,BENTON: All I know is we 
2099,"RUTH: I don't know and, frankly, I don't care. The point is that we are"
2100,"here and now. Now, what we've got to do is to define the problem "
2101,"BENTON: That's all very well, Miss Ingram, but I "
2102,"HYDE: Stop right there, Professor. The problem's defined. Come and have"
2103,a look. 
2104,(Hyde has spotted the near stationary UNIT troops.) 
2105,BENTON: It's the Brigadier. 
2106,RUTH: Exactly the same as before. 
2107,HYDE: How can it be the same as before now that the crystal's gone? 
2108,"RUTH: I think I remember the Doctor said it works independently, even"
2109,without the crystal. 
2110,"BENTON: Yes, but do you realise we're still trapped, inside. "
2111,RUTH: Now will you let me turn off the transmitter? 
2112,"BENTON: Well, I don't think we ought to. "
2113,"HYDE: Well, perhaps we could get out through the back. It may not work"
2114,all the way round. 
2115,"RUTH: I'll bet it does. How do you propose finding out? I mean, once"
2116,"you're stuck, you're stuck. "
2117,"BENTON: Yes, and only the Doctor can get you out. "
2118,RUTH: Well? 
2119,"BENTON: All right, Doctor Ingram. Switch it off. "
2120,RUTH: Ah ha! A man of decision. (Ruth switches off TOM-TIT.) 
2121,"BENTON: Go on then, switch it off. "
2122,RUTH: But I have. 
2123,HYDE: They're still stuck. 
2124,RUTH: But that's impossible! 
2125,"HYDE: Well, you'd better explain to them, lovey. They still think"
2126,"they're stuck, apparently. "
2127,"BENTON: Yes, and we're still trapped in here."
2128,
2129, [Tardis]
2130,
2131," MASTER [on scanner]: What can I do for you,"
2132,"Doctor? Or, er, is your visit purely social? "
2133,"DOCTOR: Well, I thought we might have a little chat. "
2134,MASTER [on scanner]: What an excellent idea. Why not join me out here?
2135,
2136, [The Master's Tardis]
2137,
2138, DOCTOR [on scanner]: One step outside my Tardis
2139,"and that would be the end of me, wouldn't it? "
2140,"MASTER: You have a very poor opinion of me, don't you, Doctor. "
2141,"DOCTOR [on scanner]: You've noticed. Well, well, well. "
2142,"MASTER: It might be of interest for you to know that, er, I've put a"
2143,"time lock on your Tardis. You cannot leave. Unless I lift it, of"
2144,course. 
2145,DOCTOR [on scanner]: Do you think that I haven't thought of that too?
2146,You're as trapped as I am. You couldn't even open that door of yours
2147,unless I wish it. 
2148,"MASTER: Alternatively, I could fling you out into the time vortex now."
2149,"I doubt whether you could do that to me, so be very, very careful,"
2150,Doctor. 
2151,DOCTOR [on scanner]: Do you really think I care what happens to me at
2152,the moment? Don't you realise that your plans could ru 
2153,(The Master turns the sound off.) 
2154,"MASTER: You know, he has an excellent brain, that man, though a little"
2155,"pedestrian. But, oh dear, what a bore the fellow is. "
2156,KRASIS: But is he dangerous? 
2157,MASTER: He's dangerous enough. But don't worry. I can handle him. 
2158,KRASIS: But you said he was in there! You told me he was safe in there!
2159,
2160,"MASTER: Once he realises that he's talking to himself, he'll be out"
2161,"here like a shot. Ah! He's realised it at last. That took a long time,"
2162,the slow witted fool. Now you watch. He cannot bear not to have the
2163,last word.
2164,
2165, [Tardis]
2166,
2167, DOCTOR: He's not even listening. He's turned the
2168,sound off. 
2169,"JO: Well, that's not very nice, is it? "
2170,DOCTOR: We've got to make him listen. It's our only chance of stopping
2171,him. 
2172,"JO: You're not thinking of going out there, are you? "
2173,"DOCTOR: No, not if I can help it. "
2174,"JO: Well, what are you going to do then? "
2175,(The Doctor pulls a module from underneath the console.) 
2176,"DOCTOR: If he's turned his sound receiver off, I must make myself heard"
2177,without it. 
2178,(The Doctor swaps components around in the module.) 
2179,"DOCTOR: If the thraskin puts his fingers in his ears, it is polite to"
2180,shout. That's an old Venusian proverb. 
2181,JO: What's a thraskin? 
2182,"DOCTOR: Thraskin? Oh, it's an archaic word, seldom used since the"
2183,"twenty fifth dynasty, the modern equivalent is plinge. "
2184,JO: What does plinge mean? 
2185,"DOCTOR: Oh, for heaven's sake, Jo, I've just told you. It means"
2186,thraskin. 
2187,"JO: Oh, of course."

2189, [Newton Institute laboratory]
2190,
2191, (Ruth is changing around circuit boards from
2192,TOM-TIT.) 
2193,"BENTON: But why? I mean, if you turned it on, the Brig and company"
2194,should have speeded up again. Why didn't they? 
2195,"RUTH: Well, I don't know but it looks as if TOM-TIT has made a"
2196,permanent gap in the structure of time. Our only hope is to close the
2197,gap up. 
2198,HYDE: So what are you doing? 
2199,"RUTH: Well, I'm turning the circuits upside down, so to speak. Well,"
2200,"it's empirical, but you never know. "
2201,BENTON: Empirical? 
2202,"RUTH: That, Sergeant Benton, means that I haven't got a clue what I'm"
2203,doing. 
2204,HYDE: Join the club. 
2205,"BENTON: So, it's just trial and error? Have a go and see what happens? "
2206,"RUTH: Yeah, more or less. Right, Stu, you monitor the interstitial"
2207,activity. 
2208,HYDE: Okay. 
2209,RUTH: If you get a reading over six oh give us a shout. 
2210,HYDE: And what's the upper limit? 
2211,"RUTH: If it gets to seven oh, say a quick prayer and duck. "
2212,"BENTON: Well, what about me? "
2213,"RUTH: You just stand there and look pretty. Right, Stu, are you happy? "
2214,BENTON: Ecstatic. 
2215,"RUTH: Okay then, let's have a stab at it. "
2216,"HYDE: Interstitial activity, nil. "
2217,RUTH: Molecular structure stable. Increasing power.

2220,"HYDE: Er, steady on zero zero four. "
2221,RUTH: Right. Isolate matrix scanner. 
2222,"HYDE: Check. Four five, five oh. "

2224,"HYDE: Shooting up! Five five, six oh, six five, seven oh. "
2225,"(Something happens to Benton. He seems to go dark, then collapses.) "

2227,"HYDE: Seven five, seven oh, six five, six oh, five five, five oh, four"
2228,"five, four oh, three five, three oh. "
2229,"RUTH: Right, that should be enough. I think the level should be okay"
2230,now. 
2231,"HYDE: Quite okay, I'd say. "
2232,"RUTH: Right, now let's have a look at it. "
2233,(The soldiers are still stationary.)

2248,"MASTER: Wait and see, Krasis. Wait and see. "
2249,"KRASIS: And what are you going to do, Master? "
2250,"DOCTOR [on scanner]: Testing, testing, testing. One, two, three, four,"
2251,"five, testing. "
2252,JO [on scanner]: He can hear you. 
2253,MASTER: I thought as much. 
2254,"DOCTOR [on scanner]: Yes, and he can't turn me off, can you? You've got"
2255,to listen to me now. 
2256,MASTER: Have I? 
2257,"DOCTOR [on scanner]: Obviously, you've not as yet been able to bring"
2258,"Kronos through, otherwise you wouldn't be going to Atlantis, so perhaps"
2259,there's still time to make you realise the folly of your 
2260, [Tardis]
2261,
2262, DOCTOR: Inyups senupwat. Neas nees nig datdat sig.
2263,Ilshnimuwat ijnilguin nyup nyp 
2264,"MASTER [on scanner]: I'm sorry, Doctor. What was that again? "
2265,"DOCTOR: Il shneel nukcusnok drashtarnik dag. Of all the low,"
2266,underhanded tricks! 
2267,JO: What language was that? 
2268,DOCTOR: English. 
2269,JO: English? 
2270,"DOCTOR: Yes, but backwards. "
2271,JO: I just don't get it. 
2272,"DOCTOR: Well, he's picking up my words even before I've spoken them and"
2273,"feeding them back to me through the Tardis's telepathic circuits,"
2274,making them come out backwards. 
2275,JO: The Tardis's are telepathic? 
2276,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. How else do you think they communicate? Well,"
2277,"that decides it. I've got no option. Now listen to me, Jo. When I go"
2278,"out there, I want you to "
2279,JO: You're not going out there. 
2280,DOCTOR: What else can I do? 
2281,"JO: Doctor, you said yourself it would be suicide to go out there"
2282,without the protection of the Tardis! 
2283,"DOCTOR: Well, I've got to risk it. He's got to be stopped, but that's"
2284,"no reason to put you into any danger. Now once I go out of that door, I"
2285,"want you to close it, all right? "
2286,JO: But that means you'll be locked out! 
2287,"DOCTOR: Yes, and you'll be safely locked in. Now, you're not to open"
2288,that door for anybody or anything until I say so. 
2289,JO: I won't do it. I will not do it! 
2290,"DOCTOR: Jo, you'll do as you're told! It's your job, remember? "
2291,"JO: Doctor, if anything happens to you, I "
2292,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know, Jo, I know. Now go and open that door."

2294, [The Master's Tardis]
2295,
2296,(The Doctor enters.) 
2297,"MASTER: There you are, Krasis. What did I tell you? "
2298,DOCTOR: Won't you introduce me? 
2299,"KRASIS: I am Krasis, High Priest of the temple of Poseidon. "
2300,"DOCTOR: Greetings to you, Krasis. Any friend of the Master's is an"
2301,enemy of mine. 
2302,"MASTER: Oh come, Doctor, must we play games? I take it you have"
2303,something to say to me before I destroy you? 
2304,"DOCTOR: Yes, I most certainly have."
2305,
2306, [Tardis]
2307,
2308, MASTER [on scanner]: Your usual song of death and
2309,disaster? I do wish you'd learn a new tune.
2310,
2311, [The Master's Tardis]
2312,
2313, DOCTOR: You're risking the total destruction of
2314,the entire cosmos. 
2315,"MASTER: Of course I am. All or nothing, literally! What a glorious"
2316,alternative! 
2317,DOCTOR: You're mad! Paranoid! 
2318,MASTER: Who isn't? The only difference is that I'm a little more honest
2319,"than the rest. Goodbye, Doctor! "
2320,(The Master switches on the crystal.) 
2321,"KRASIS: No, Master, no! "
2322,(The white figure starts to appear.) 
2323,"MASTER: Behold, Kronos, a rare and delicate feast for you. A Time Lord!"
2324,Devour him! 
2325,(Kronos envelops the Doctor.)
2326,
2327, [Tardis]
2328,
2329, JO: Doctor! 
2330,(Jo faints.)
2331,
2332, [The Master's Tardis]
2333,
2334, (The Master holds the seal.) 
2335,"MASTER: Kronos, be at peace! I command you, be at peace! "
2336,(Kronos goes back into the crystal.) 
2337,"MASTER: Your work is nearly done, for now. You see, Krasis? Kronos is"
2338,my slave. 
2339,(The Master notices Jo getting up on the scanner.) 
2340,MASTER: Miss Grant? 
2341,JO [on scanner]: What's happened to the Doctor? You must help him! 
2342,"MASTER: Ah, he's beyond my help, my dear. He's beyond anybody's help. "
2343,"JO [on scanner]: You mean that thing, that, that creature really"
2344,swallowed him up? 
2345,"MASTER: Ah, that's a nice point. Yes and no. Yes, it engulfed him. No,"
2346,it didn't actually eat him up. He's out there in the time vortex and
2347,there he's going to stay. 
2348,JO [on scanner]: Then he is alive? 
2349,"MASTER: Well, if you can call it that. Alive for ever in an eternity of"
2350,"nothingness. To coin a phrase, a living death. "
2351,"JO [on scanner]: That that's the most cruel, the most wicked thing I"
2352,ever heard. 
2353,"MASTER: Thank you, my dear. Now, what are we going to do about you,"
2354,though? You're an embarrassment to me. As indeed is that antiquated
2355,piece of junk of the Doctor's. Now let me see 
2356,"JO [on scanner]: I don't really care anymore. Do what you like, but"
2357,just get it over with. 
2358,"MASTER: Your word is my command. Goodbye, Miss Grant! "
2359,(The two Tardises move in and out of each other in the vortex. On the
2360,"scanner, Jo's image sways then blurs as the two time machines finally"
2361,separate.) 
2362, Episode Five
2363,
2364, [Tardis]
2365,
2366, (Jo wakes to the sound of whispers.) 
2367,JO: Doctor. 
2368,"DOCTOR : Jo. Jo, are you in there? "
2369,"JO: Doctor? Oh, it is you. "
2370,DOCTOR : Thank heavens you're alive. 
2371,"JO: Oh, I'm so happy. Where are you? "
2372,"DOCTOR : I'm nowhere, Jo. I'm still in the time vortex. The Tardis"
2373,is relaying my thoughts to you. 
2374,JO: What are all those other voices I can hear? 
2375,"DOCTOR : What other voices? Oh. Oh, those are my subconscious"
2376,thoughts. But I shouldn't listen to them too hard if I were you. I'm
2377,not all that proud of some of them. 
2378,JO: But I still don't understand? But you must be somewhere. Tell me
2379,how I can get you back? 
2380,"DOCTOR : Oh, you can't, Jo, but luckily the Tardis can. That's why"
2381,she's put us in touch. 
2382,"JO: But what do you? I mean, what does she want me to do? "
2383,"DOCTOR : Well, go to control panel number three. "
2384,JO: Okay. 
2385,"DOCTOR : Now, lift the little lid marked Extreme Emergency. "
2386,JO: Right. 
2387,DOCTOR : The one with the red handle inside? 
2388,JO: Mmm hm. 
2389,"DOCTOR : All right, Jo. Pull it. "
2390,(Jo pulls the handle straight up. There is a brief materialisation
2391,sound then the whispers stop and the Doctor is sitting on the floor.) 
2392,"DOCTOR: Hello, Jo. "
2393,JO: Doctor!
2394,
2395, [Atlantis plaza]
2396,
2397, (Three important buildings open onto a raised dais
2398,at one end of the open space. Two trumpeters blow large curved brass
2399,horns. The great and the good have been gathered here for something
2400,special.) 
2401,ATLANTEAN 1: Open the doors! 
2402,ATLANTEAN 2: Open the doors! 
2403,(Dalios leaves his palace and goes to sit on a throne on a raised dais.
2404,A woman is carried in on a litter borne by Nubian slaves. A priest
2405,thumps his staff on the ground three times.) 
2406,"CRITO: Peace, my brothers. His holiness, the most venerable priest of"
2407,"Poseidon, King of the Ten Kings, will hear his council. "
2408,"HIPPIAS: My lord, your holiness, most venerable priest of "
2409,"DALIOS: Yes, yes, yes, I hear you, friend. "
2410,"HIPPIAS: Lord, may I speak plainly? "
2411,DALIOS: It would grieve me to think you would ever speak otherwise.
2412,Speak as a friend should speak. 
2413,"HIPPIAS: You are popular, Dalios. The people love you. Will their love"
2414,fill their bellies in the winter when the granaries are empty? 
2415,"DALIOS: Your words are plain indeed, Hippias. What would you have me"
2416,do? Order the rain to fall? 
2417,"HIPPIAS: Aye, Dalios, I would! "
2418,MISEUS: Hippias! 
2419,DALIOS: Have a care! 
2420,"HIPPIAS: Indeed, I shall have a care! A care for the people of"
2421,"Atlantis. A care that foolish superstition, old wives tales, the fear"
2422,of old men should not prevent our caring for them as our rank demands. 
2423,"MISEUS: He speaks the truth, o King. "
2424,DALIOS: You know not what you ask. 
2425,HIPPIAS: Must I be plainer still? I know quite well! I ask for the
2426,blessings our forefathers once enjoyed. I ask for the divine power to
2427,"be given back to the land, from which it was so cruelly stolen!"
2428,
2429, [The Master's Tardis]
2430,
2431,"(The machine is still in flight, and the Master is"
2432,poring over a map.) 
2433,"KRASIS: But, Master, why are we not in Atlantis? "
2434,"MASTER: My dear Krasis, I must work out our landing coordinates as"
2435,"accurately as possible. You see, your people must realise immediately"
2436,"that I am the Master, that I come from the gods and that I am bringing"
2437,Kronos back to them. 
2438,KRASIS: Where then will you arrive? 
2439,"MASTER: Why smack in the middle of the temple, of course."
2440,
2441, [Atlantis plaza]
2442,
2443, (The council are all talking at once.) 
2444,"DALIOS: Brothers, silence! Peace! Peace, I say. I shall speak plainly"
2445,too. You ask for the blessings of the golden years. Yet there came a
2446,"time when Atlantis grew to hate them. What would you have, Hippias? If"
2447,"you were master of Kronos, lord of time. Ten crops in one season? A"
2448,"surfeit of fishes? An ocean of wine? Then take the barren soil as well,"
2449,"the stinking piles of rotting meat, an idle drunken people. I tell you"
2450,Kronos was a curse! 
2451,"HIPPIAS: But Dalios, I "
2452,CRITO: Be silent! The King speaks! 
2453,DALIOS: I have seen a temple twice the size of this fall through a
2454,"crack in the very bedrock of the earth. I have seen a city drowned, a"
2455,"land laid waste by fire, so listen to the fears of an old man. For I"
2456,"tell you, if Kronos came again, Atlantis would be doomed, destroyed,"
2457,never to rise again! 
2458,"(The woman, Queen Galleia, rises from her chair.) "
2459,"GALLEIA: Dalios, listen. I hear strange music. "
2460,(A Tardis is materialising somewhere.) 
2461,GALLEIA: There it is again. 
2462,"(In the lower right corner of the plaza, a mainframe computer appears.)"
2463,
2464,GALLEIA: Look! 
2465,DALIOS: Guards! 
2466,(The Master steps out of his Tardis and pushes a trident aside.) 
2467,DALIOS: Who are you? 
2468,MASTER: I am the Master. I come as an emissary from the gods. 
2469,DALIOS: Indeed? Any god in particular? 
2470,"MASTER: Of course, why should you trust me. "
2471,(The Master snaps his fingers and Krasis comes out of the Tardis.) 
2472,CRITO: Krasis! 
2473,DALIOS: Krasis! 
2474,MASTER: Now do you believe me? 
2475,DALIOS: What do you want? 
2476,MASTER: To speak of the ancient mysteries. The secrets of the mighty
2477,Kronos. 
2478,"DALIOS: You are brave indeed, o Master. An emissary from the gods?"
2479,"Brothers, should I listen to this man? "
2480,GALLEIA: He has the very bearing of a god himself. 
2481,MISEUS: He appeared from the heavens like Zeus. 
2482,DALIOS: I have seen many such tricks. Krasis? 
2483,"KRASIS: Most venerable, I have seen him! I have seen the Mighty One! "
2484,DALIOS: You have seen Kronos? We must speak together privately. The
2485,"council is at an end. Come, lady. "
2486,(Dalios leads Krasis and the Master to his palace. The Master pauses
2487,"alongside Galleia, and bows.) "
2488,CRITO: The council is at an end. The king departs. Sound trumpets! 
2489,GALLEIA: He had the bearing of the gods.
2490,
2491, [Tardis]
2492,
2493, (The time detector is active.) 
2494,"DOCTOR: There we are, Jo. On our way to Atlantis. "
2495,"JO: But you can't just take the Tardis wherever you want, can you? I"
2496,"mean, you haven't even managed to fix it yet? Or have you? "
2497,"DOCTOR: No, not entirely, but the time sensor will lead us to where the"
2498,Master's Tardis is. 
2499,JO: But not inside it? 
2500,"DOCTOR: No, I hope not. Not this time. But we'll soon find out."
2501,
2502, [Atlantis plaza]
2503,
2504," HIPPIAS: But, Krasis, I beseech you. Please give"
2505,me the chance 
2506,(Another materialisation sound echoes around the plaza. The police box
2507,parks herself next to the computer and the Doctor and Jo come out.) 
2508,"DOCTOR: Well, well, well. Isn't it a small world. "
2509,KRASIS: You are still alive? 
2510,"DOCTOR: Yes, so it would seem. "
2511,KRASIS: But not for long. Guards! 
2512,HIPPIAS: No! I forbid it! Are you mad? Who are these strangers? 
2513,"KRASIS: They are the enemies of the Master, and therefore the enemies"
2514,of our people and our land. 
2515,DOCTOR: We've come here to warn you that 
2516,"KRASIS: Silence! You will regret this interference, Lord. Take them to"
2517,the King! 
2518,"GUARD: Come, this way."
2519,
2520, [Dalios' terrace] 
2521, (The Master stands respectfully before the King.) 
2522,"DALIOS: But if the high priest saw fit to break a scared trust, you"
2523,think that good reason for the king to follow? 
2524,MASTER: Your high priest saw the crystal in my hands. He saw Kronos
2525,"himself, saw him dominated by me. Krasis knows that I am the Master of"
2526,Kronos. 
2527,"(Galleia is hiding behind a column, listening.) "
2528,DALIOS: Krasis is but a slave at heart. 
2529,"MASTER: Maybe, but he has come to learn that it is well to obey me. "
2530,DALIOS: You seek to make me fear you? 
2531,"MASTER: Oh, not at all. But if you will but see, like Krasis, that I am"
2532,"indeed the Master of Kronos, then naturally you will obey me. "
2533,(The Master sits and looks into Dalios' eyes.) 
2534,MASTER: You will obey me. You will obey me! 
2535,"DALIOS: A very elementary technique of fascination. I'm too old a fish,"
2536,too old in years and in the hidden ways to be caught in such a net. You
2537,are no emissary from the gods. 
2538,MASTER: But you saw 
2539,"DALIOS: Tell me, then. What of great Poseidon? What did he have for"
2540,"breakfast? Fish, I suppose? And what of Zeus and Hera? What is the"
2541,latest gossip from Olympus? Do tell me. 
2542,"MASTER: I underestimated you, Dalios. "
2543,"DALIOS: I'm no child to play with such painted dolls. Kronos is no god,"
2544,no titan. I know that and so do you. 
2545,MASTER: The king is old in wisdom. 
2546,DALIOS: Now you try to flatter me. You'll pull a string and want to see
2547,me dance. You shall not have the crystal. 
2548,MASTER: I shall go now. I have nothing more to say to you. 
2549,DALIOS: You have said nothing to me yet. When you find the true words
2550,"to speak, I will listen."
2551,
2552, [Palace] 
2553, (The Master goes into the building from the King's
2554,balcony.) 
2555,DOCTOR: Good afternoon. Now where have I seen that face before? Can't
2556,think of anything to say? 
2557,"JO: How about curses, foiled again. "
2558,(The Master leaves with an escort.) 
2559,HIPPIAS: Come this way.
2560,
2561, [Dalios' terrace] 
2562, (Galleia has returned to her own rooms to think.) 
2563,DALIOS: Strangers are uncommon in our land. Who are you? 
2564,"DOCTOR: This is Jo, Jo Grant, your Majesty. "
2565,"DALIOS: You are welcome, Jojo Grant. Surely as in ancient times, a"
2566,goddess has descend from Olympus. 
2567,"JO: But I'm not a goddess, Honestly, I'm not. "
2568,"DALIOS: No, no, of course you're not, my child. Forgive the clumsy"
2569,gallantry of an old man. I'm afraid I'm sadly out of practice. Hippias?
2570,
2571,HIPPIAS: Lord? 
2572,"DALIOS: Take the lady Jojo Grant to the Queen while I talk with this,"
2573,er 
2574,"JO: Oh, this is the Doctor. "
2575,DALIOS: This learned man. 
2576,"HIPPIAS: This way, Lady. "
2577,DOCTOR: You'll be all right. 
2578,(Jo and Hippias leave.) 
2579,DALIOS: Forgive the roughness of your welcome. Hippias has all the
2580,delicacy of a red necked fisherman. 
2581,"DOCTOR: Nevertheless, he did save our lives, your Majesty. "
2582,DALIOS: Indeed? He kept that to himself.
2583,
2584, [Galleia's chambers]
2585,
2586, (Galleia is having her hair arranged by a
2587,handmaiden.) 
2588,"GALLEIA: But what did you think of him, Lakis? "
2589,"LAKIS: He had the bearing of a god, Lady. "
2590,"GALLEIA: My very thoughts. In fact, my very words. Are you teasing me,"
2591,girl? Would you dare? 
2592,"LAKIS: No, Lady, no. "
2593,"GALLEIA: No, I hardly think you would. Are you frightened? I shan't be"
2594,angered by your reply if it is an honest one. 
2595,LAKIS: I like the Lord Hippias better. 
2596,GALLEIA: A sweetmeat. A confection for a child's taste. I prefer this
2597,Master. He would not cloy upon the tongue as Hippias does. 
2598,"LAKIS: He is a very handsome man, Lady. "
2599,"GALLEIA: Handsome? Aye, he looked well enough. But his face, Lakis, it"
2600,was a face of power. A man with such a face would dare risk the world
2601,to win his own desire. Hippias is but a boy. A petulant boy. 
2602,(Hippias enters.) 
2603,"HIPPIAS: And a foolish one, no doubt, to trust a queen. "
2604,"GALLEIA: Foolish, certainly, to think himself man enough to love a"
2605,"queen. No, Lakis, come back. The Lord Hippias is not staying. "
2606,"HIPPIAS: The Lord Hippias would not be here at all, but he has been"
2607,sent on an errand by the King. 
2608,GALLEIA: Then give me your message and go. 
2609,HIPPIAS: Lady? I did my best. 
2610,GALLEIA: He made you look a fool. 
2611,(Jo enters.) 
2612,"HIPPIAS: Lady Galleia, may I present to you the lady Jojo Grant. The"
2613,King bids you treat her as an honoured guest. 
2614,JO: How do you? Greetings. 
2615,"GALLEIA: Greetings, Lady. You come from a far land? "
2616,JO: It couldn't be much further. 
2617,"HIPPIAS: She and her companion fell from the skies, as did the Master. "
2618,GALLEIA: A day of wonders. 
2619,JO: You can say that again. 
2620,GALLEIA: Why should I say it again? Lakis? Show the Lady Jojo Grant 
2621,"JO: Oh, it's just Jo, actually. "
2622,"GALLEIA: Your pardon. Show the Lady Jo to a guest room, and give her"
2623,attire more fitting to a lady of the court. 
2624,"LAKIS: Yes, Lady. "
2625,JO: Thank you. 
2626,LAKIS: This way. 
2627,GALLEIA: And Lakis? Return quickly. I have an errand for you. 
2628,"LAKIS: Yes, Lady. "
2629,(Lakis and Jo leave by an inner door.) 
2630,HIPPIAS: And none for me to run? A flower perhaps? A token of undying
2631,"love to some lordling of the court? But no, it would be dead before it"
2632,were delivered. 
2633,"GALLEIA: You are impertinent! Remember, I am Galleia, Queen of"
2634,"Atlantis, daughter of kings and wife of Dalios. So, have a care. "
2635,"HIPPIAS: Your pardon. I took you for another. I knew Galleia once, you"
2636,"see. The woman, not the queen. A sweet and loving lady. I took you for"
2637,her. Please do forgive me. 
2638,GALLEIA: You may go. 
2639,"HIPPIAS: I thank you, Lady. "
2640,(Hippias leaves.) 
2641,"GALLEIA: Lakis? Lakis, come to me at once. "
2642,(Lakis enters.) 
2643,"GALLEIA: Come closer. Go to the Lord Master, and when no one is near,"
2644,say quietly to him only one word. 
2645,"LAKIS: What word, Lady? "
2646,GALLEIA: Kronos.
2647,
2648, [Dalios' terrace] 
2649, (Twilight.) 
2650,"DALIOS: Kronos. Kronos. Kronos. I am the last alive who has known, who"
2651,"has seen, who remembers with a terror of twisted guts. And these fools"
2652,would have me bring him back. 
2653,"DOCTOR: Well, why didn't you destroy the crystal? "
2654,DALIOS: We tried and merely split the smaller crystal from it. It
2655,cannot be destroyed. 
2656,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. It's just like the Tardis. It has its being"
2657,outside time and its appearance is here. 
2658,"DALIOS: You are a philosopher, friend. "
2659,"DOCTOR: Well, if wisdom is to seek the truth, I am, yes. "
2660,"DALIOS: Then help me, Doctor. Help me to find a way to stop these evil"
2661,men. Help me to save Atlantis from destruction.
2662,
2663, [Galleia's chambers] 
2664, MASTER: Where is she? 
2665,"LAKIS: If you will please wait, Lord. "
2666,MASTER: The Master waits for no one. I shall return when the Queen is
2667,ready to speak with me. 
2668,"(Galleia enters, carrying a black cat.) "
2669,"GALLEIA: Please stay. Lord, great Lord, be seated. The wine, Lakis. "
2670,(The Master remains standing. Lakis brings two goblets.) 
2671,GALLEIA: You may go. Minister to the needs of our guest. 
2672,"(Lakis leaves. Galleia and the Master sit, and he looks into her eyes.)"
2673,
2674,"MASTER: Lady Queen, you are beautiful."
2675,
2676, [Palace guest room] 
2677, (Jo is now in Minoan dress and wig and admiring
2678,herself in a cheval mirror.) 
2679,"JO: Wow, what a groovy dress. Do you reckon it'll get mum's approval? "
2680,"LAKIS: Mum? Oh, you mean Queen Galleia? "
2681,"JO: Yeah, guess so. "
2682,LAKIS: Mum. 
2683,"JO: Anyway, let's go and give her a preview. "
2684,"LAKIS: No, I'm sorry. She does not wish to be disturbed. The Lord"
2685,Master is with her. 
2686,JO: Is he now? 
2687,LAKIS: They speak of the sacred mysteries. 
2688,JO: Kronos and all that bit? 
2689,LAKIS: It is forbidden. 
2690,JO: But that is what they're on about? 
2691,LAKIS: Yes. 
2692,JO: Right. 
2693,"LAKIS: No, you mustn't go in. You mustn't! "
2694,"JO: Look, I'll be quiet as a. Do they have mice in Atlantis? "
2695,LAKIS: Yes. 
2696,"JO: Well, that's what I'll be as quiet as. An Atlantean mouse, okay? "
2697,(Jo opens the connecting door a little.)
2698,
2699, [Galleia's chambers]
2700,
2701," GALLEIA: You're a man who knows what he wants,"
2702,Lord Master. 
2703,MASTER: And takes it. 
2704,GALLEIA: You want the crystal? 
2705,MASTER: I am going to possess it. 
2706,GALLEIA: Not without my consent. 
2707,MASTER: Of course not. But I am confident that you will give it. 
2708,GALLEIA: Why should I help you? 
2709,"MASTER: For the sake of Atlantis, Lady. Would you not see her restored"
2710,"to her former glory? Rich, powerful, magnificent among the nations of"
2711,the world? Who would not be ruler of such a country? 
2712,GALLEIA: Nothing must happen to Dalios. 
2713,"MASTER: Why should it? He will rule for many years, the beloved"
2714,sovereign of a beloved prosperous people. 
2715,GALLEIA: But surely you would want to 
2716,"MASTER: Well, purely because of Lord Dalios' great age, it might be"
2717,well if he were relieved of some of the more onerous duties of
2718,"kingship. But the reins of power, Lady Queen, should be in stronger"
2719,hands. Hands such as yours. 
2720,GALLEIA: And yours? 
2721,"MASTER: It would be a pleasure to serve you. And then, when the end"
2722,"comes for Dalios, as it must come for all men, then perhaps? "
2723,GALLEIA: The crystal shall be yours.
2724,
2725, [Palace guest room] 
2726, MASTER : Tell me. Where is it kept?
2727,
2728, [Galleia's chambers]
2729,
2730, GALLEIA: Deep in the earth. Beneath the temple.
2731,"Dalios has the key. Oh, and Krasis has the key. "
2732,"MASTER: Well then, Krasis will take me there. I'll speak with him"
2733,immediately. 
2734,"GALLEIA: I wish it were as simple as that. No one can get near, save"
2735,Dalios himself. It's certain death to try. 
2736,MASTER: What is the danger? 
2737,GALLEIA: The guardian.
2738,
2739, [Dalios' terrace] 
2740, (Night has fallen.) 
2741,"DOCTOR: Yes, but who is the guardian? "
2742,DALIOS: A beast. A man. You can take your choice. Once he was my
2743,"friend, a fellow councillor, a great athlete, and just as I longed for"
2744,"the wisdom the years alone could bring, so he craved great strength."
2745,The strength of the bull and a long life in which to use it. 
2746,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a harmless enough ambition, I should have thought? "
2747,DALIOS: So should I. But Kronos in his blind sport gave him his desire.
2748,"But not only the strength, the head of a bull. And so he has remained"
2749,for the past five hundred years or more. 
2750,DOCTOR: He's the minotaur. 
2751,DALIOS: Please? 
2752,DOCTOR: It doesn't matter. Please go on. 
2753,"DALIOS: Well, there's little more to tell. No one else shall suffer as"
2754,"he has suffered. Till the last day of his life, for which he longs so"
2755,"ardently, he will guard the crystal. No one can approach it. To try is"
2756,certain death.
2757,
2758, [Galleia's chambers]
2759,
2760," MASTER: Would you like to volunteer, Krasis? "
2761,"KRASIS: No, Lord, no! "
2762,GALLEIA: Very well then. We shall send one down who is mighty with the
2763,"sword, and who longs with all his heart to seize the crystal. One whose"
2764,death would be of little account. 
2765,"KRASIS: But who, Lady? "
2766,"GALLEIA: Hippias, of course."
2767,
2768, [Palace guest room] 
2769, LAKIS: What can we do? What can we do? 
2770,"JO: We'll tell the Doctor, that's what we can do. Now, take me to the"
2771,King. 
2772,"LAKIS: Oh, I dare not, Lady Jo. "
2773,JO: Would you rather let your precious Hippias face that creature? 
2774,"LAKIS: Oh well, come quickly, then."
2775,
2776, [Atlantis plaza] 
2777, (Lakis leads Jo across the plaza to the main
2778,door.) 
2779,LAKIS: This way. 
2780,GUARD: Halt! 
2781,JO: Take me to the King. 
2782,(Crito comes out of the palace.) 
2783,CRITO: The King is not to be disturbed. 
2784,JO: But I've got to see the Doctor! It's a matter of life and death! 
2785,CRITO: Indeed it is. Yours. 
2786,JO: Will you hear what I've got to say? 
2787,LAKIS: Come away. 
2788,(Lakis takes Jo away from the steps.) 
2789,JO: (sotto) What's the matter? 
2790,LAKIS: (sotto) Have a care. The Lord Crito is no friend to Hippias. 
2791,JO: (sotto) But 
2792,(Krasis and Hippias come out of another door.) 
2793,"JO: Right, they're going now. I'll follow them. You try to get in and"
2794,"tell the Doctor, and the King for that matter. All right? Now take"
2795,care. 
2796, [Temple of Poseidon] 
2797, (Krasis leads Hippias through to the altar and
2798,points the way to the undercroft. Hippias draws his sword and goes down
2799,the steps.) 
2800,JO: No! 
2801, [Temple undercroft] 
2802, (Jo sees Hippias go to the wooden door.) 
2803,"JO: No, Hippias! Don't go in there! "
2804,(Krasis grabs Jo from behind and she is pushed through the door.)
2805,
2806, [Temple Catacombs]
2807,
2808,(Jo is shut in.) 
2809,JO: Open the door and let me out! 
2810,(Something roars.) 
2811, Episode Six
2812,
2813, [Temple Catacombs] 
2814, (It is  Dave
2815,Prowse wearing a bull's head.)
2816,
2817, [Dalios' terrace] 
2818, (Lakis runs in.) 
2819,DALIOS: What is it? 
2820,CRITO : Come back! 
2821,"LAKIS: Forgive me, Lord King, forgive me! "
2822,"DALIOS: Tell us, child. "
2823,"CRITO: Your pardon, Lord. "
2824,(Crito grabs Lakis and starts to drag her away.) 
2825,LAKIS: Lord Hippias and the High Priest have gone into the lair of the
2826,Guardian followed by the Lady Jo! DOCTOR: What? 
2827,(Jo and the Minotaur are playing hide and seek amongst the columns of
2828,the catacombs.)
2829,
2830, [Temple undercroft] 
2831, (A guard has been placed on the door to the lair.
2832,The Doctor comes down the steps.) 
2833,KRASIS: Seize this intruder! 
2834,(The Doctor grabs the guard's trident and pins both him and Krasis
2835,against the wall.) 
2836,"DOCTOR: Sorry to hold you up like this, Krasis, but I need that key. "
2837,"(The Doctor snatches the key, breaks the trident over his knee and"
2838,enters the catacombs. Krasis follows him.)
2839,
2840, [Temple Catacombs] 
2841,(Jo runs up against a mirrored wall. The Minotaur
2842,is close behind her.) 
2843,"DOCTOR: Jo? Jo? Jo? Jo, where are you? "
2844,"(The Minotaur finds Jo, then Hippias intervenes waving a flaming"
2845,torch.) 
2846,HIPPIAS: Stay back! 
2847,"(The Minotaur walks towards Hippias, who throws the torch at it. The"
2848,Minotaur easily picks up Hippias and throws him to the floor. Hippias
2849,"jumps up and lies across the Minotaur's shoulders, from where he is"
2850,lifted high and thrown through a mirror. The Doctor shouts something
2851,"which is obscured by the sound of breaking glass, then holds his cape"
2852,out.) 
2853,DOCTOR: Toro! 
2854,(The Minotaur charges the cape and the Doctor executes a neat veronica
2855,"with his plaid capote. They repeat the move and as the Minotaur passes,"
2856,"the Doctor clubs it on the back of the neck. It falls, dazed, and the"
2857,Doctor goes over to Jo.) 
2858,"JO: Doctor, are you all right? "
2859,(The Minotaur charges again.) 
2860,"DOCTOR: Look out, Jo! "
2861,"(They stand aside and the Minotaur charges the mirrored wall, crashing"
2862,"through the blocks of masonry to reveal a hidden room, then dies.)"
2863,
2864, [Secret vault]
2865,
2866, JO: Hippias! He saved my life. 
2867,"DOCTOR: I'm afraid he's dead, Jo. The crystal! It's the crystal of"
2868,Kronos! 
2869,(The three pronged crystal illuminates the decorated vault from its
2870,cauldron.) 
2871,"DOCTOR: There you, Jo. That's what all the fuss has been about. "
2872,"JO: It's beautiful, but at the same time, horrible. It gives me a funny"
2873,feeling. 
2874,"DOCTOR: Well, cheer up, Jo. Now that we've found the crystal, the"
2875,Master's little game is at an end. 
2876,KRASIS: Not quite! The game is just beginning. A pity you will not live
2877,to see the end. 
2878,"DOCTOR: That's where you're mistaken, Krasis. And if you value your own"
2879,"life, you will take me to see the King. Now!"
2880,
2881, [Dalios' terrace] 
2882," MASTER: But I am the King. Oh, didn't he tell you?"
2883,"Oh, he's a jolly fellow, our friend, Krasis. He loves a joke. "
2884,DOCTOR: Does he really? 
2885,"MASTER: A complete success, our little palace revolution. "
2886,DOCTOR: What happened to King Dalios? 
2887,"MASTER: Why, nothing. "
2888,DOCTOR: Then he's still alive? 
2889,(Galleia enters.) 
2890,"MASTER: Why, certainly. And treated honourably. "
2891,"GALLEIA: Even though Dalios is an old man, the King is still the King. "
2892,MASTER: And now it appears that I have to thank you both. 
2893,JO: What for? 
2894,MASTER: For giving me the crystal. 
2895,DOCTOR: You don't mean to say that you still intend going ahead with
2896,this 
2897,MASTER: Tomorrow you will both receive a suitable reward. An
2898,"introduction to the mighty Kronos. And this time, Doctor, there will be"
2899,no mistake. 
2900,DOCTOR: I wouldn't count on that. 
2901,"(Guards take the Doctor and Jo away, followed by Krasis.) "
2902,"MASTER: Right, Lady, I have a lot to do so you must leave me too. "
2903,GALLEIA: Must I indeed. 
2904,MASTER: You would question my decision? 
2905,GALLEIA: Perhaps. It depends what you mean to do. 
2906,"MASTER: You must learn to obey, my love. To do my will. To carry out my"
2907,"commands without question, like a soldier. "
2908,"GALLEIA: You mean like a servant girl? And you must learn, my love,"
2909,that Galleia is a Queen.
2910,
2911, [Palace dungeon] 
2912," (The Doctor and Jo sit on the floor, manacled to"
2913,the wall.) 
2914,DOCTOR: Any luck? 
2915,"JO: Funnily enough, they didn't include Atlantean chains in my"
2916,"escapology course. No, it's no good. Doctor, what are we going to do? "
2917,"DOCTOR: Well, we'll just have to play it by ear, won't we. "
2918,JO: What happens if the Master wins? 
2919,"DOCTOR: Well, the whole of creation is very delicately balanced in"
2920,"cosmic terms, Jo. If the Master opens the floodgates of Kronos' power,"
2921,"all order and all structure will be swept away, and nothing will be"
2922,left but chaos. 
2923,"JO: Makes it seem so pointless really, doesn't it. "
2924,DOCTOR: I felt like that once when I was young. It was the blackest day
2925,of my life. 
2926,JO: Why? 
2927,"DOCTOR: Ah, well, that's another story. I'll tell you about it one day."
2928,"The point is, that day was not only my blackest, it was also my best. "
2929,"JO: Well, what do you mean? "
2930,"DOCTOR: Well, when I was a little boy, we used to live in a house that"
2931,"was perched halfway up the top of a mountain. And behind our house,"
2932,"there sat under a tree an old man, a hermit, a monk. He'd lived under"
2933,"this tree for half his lifetime, so they said, and he'd learned the"
2934,"secret of life. So, when my black day came, I went and asked him to"
2935,help me. 
2936,"JO: And he told you the secret? Well, what was it? "
2937,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm coming to that, Jo, in my own time. Ah, I'll never"
2938,"forget what it was like up there. All bleak and cold, it was. A few"
2939,bare rocks with some weeds sprouting from them and some pathetic little
2940,"patches of sludgy snow. It was just grey. Grey, grey, grey. Well, the"
2941,"tree the old man sat under, that was ancient and twisted and the old"
2942,"man himself was, he was as brittle and as dry as a leaf in the autumn. "
2943,JO: But what did he say? 
2944,"DOCTOR: Nothing, not a word. He just sat there, silently,"
2945,"expressionless, and he listened whilst I poured out my troubles to him."
2946,"I was too unhappy even for tears, I remember. And when I'd finished, he"
2947,lifted a skeletal hand and he pointed. Do you know what he pointed at? 
2948,JO: No. 
2949,"DOCTOR: A flower. One of those little weeds. Just like a daisy, it was."
2950,"Well, I looked at it for a moment and suddenly I saw it through his"
2951,"eyes. It was simply glowing with life, like a perfectly cut jewel. And"
2952,"the colours? Well, the colours were deeper and richer than you could"
2953,"possibly imagine. Yes, that was the daisiest daisy I'd ever seen. "
2954,"JO: And that was the secret of life? A daisy? Honestly, Doctor. "
2955,"DOCTOR: Yes, I laughed too when I first heard it. So, later, I got up"
2956,and I ran down that mountain and I found that the rocks weren't grey at
2957,"all, but they were red, brown and purple and gold. And those pathetic"
2958,"little patches of sludgy snow, they were shining white. Shining white"
2959,"in the sunlight. You still frightened, Jo? "
2960,"JO: No, not as much as I was. "
2961,DOCTOR: That's good. I'm sorry I brought you to Atlantis. 
2962,JO: I'm not. 
2963,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
2964,(The door opens.) 
2965,"GUARD: Inside, old man! "
2966,DALIOS: I demand to be taken to the Lady Galleia! 
2967,GUARD: You'll do as you're told. 
2968,DALIOS: How dare you lay your hands on me! I shall see the Queen! Out
2969,"of my way, slave! "
2970,(Dalios raises his hand and the guard hits him with his trident. Dalios
2971,falls and the guard locks the door again.) 
2972,DOCTOR: Dalios! Dalios! 
2973,DALIOS: Who would have thought it. My sweet Queen. 
2974,DOCTOR: Is the Master responsible for this? 
2975,"DALIOS: Aye, but tis no matter. Come closer. "
2976,DOCTOR: What is it? 
2977,DALIOS: There's so little time. So little. I tell you the vision of a
2978,dying man. Atlantis was doomed. You are a true philosopher. The world
2979,"must be, must be saved. And you are the one to do it. The only one."
2980,Who'd have thought it? My lovely Galleia. 
2981,(Dalios dies in Jo's lap.) 
2982,"DOCTOR: Dalios! We won't fail you, Dalios."
2983,
2984, [Atlantis plaza]
2985,
2986," (Morning, and the council has been summoned. The"
2987,surviving prisoners are fastened either side of the dais.) 
2988,"CRITO: Silence! The Lady Galleia, Queen of Atlantis, now speaks. "
2989,"GALLEIA: Brethren of the council, my faithful few. Our troubles are now"
2990,"at an end. No longer shall we fret beneath the hand of an old, defeated"
2991,"king. I shall present to you his holiness, the most venerable, Lord"
2992,Master. 
2993,"DOCTOR: Quite above himself, isn't he. "
2994,CRITO: Silence! 
2995,"MASTER: Greetings to you, my brothers. I grieve to see the council is"
2996,"so small. And yet I rejoice that you, the few who have put me here,"
2997,"have come to claim your just reward. Today, you shall see the Mighty"
2998,"One himself. Kronos, the most terrible. Krasis, the high priest will"
2999,"assist me. Prepare, Krasis. "
3000,"(The part of TOM-TIT that the Master brought from the lab, containing"
3001,"the fragment of crystal, is in the plaza. The larger crystal is with"
3002,it. Krasis operates the device.) 
3003,DOCTOR: What happened to the rest of the council? 
3004,"JO: Yes, where are they? "
3005,DOCTOR: Are they alive? 
3006,"MASTER: The point is academic, Doctor. In a few moments, it'll be of no"
3007,further interest to you. 
3008,"DOCTOR: Then satisfy my curiosity now. Are they indeed alive, or are"
3009,they dead like King Dalios? 
3010,GALLEIA: The King is unharmed. 
3011,"DOCTOR: The King is dead, Madame. "
3012,JO: It's true. We were there when he died this morning. 
3013,GALLEIA: You were there? You saw him? Is this true? Is this true? Is
3014,"the lord Dalios, your King, no longer alive? Answer me. "
3015,MASTER: He died this morning. He was an old man. 
3016,DOCTOR: And you were responsible for his death! 
3017,GUARD: Quiet! 
3018,GALLEIA: You promised. 
3019,"MASTER: I promised you power, and you shall have it. Power to realise"
3020,your most ambitious dreams! 
3021,GALLEIA: You promised he should not be harmed! 
3022,MASTER: He was an old man. And he was stubborn! 
3023,(Galleia slaps the Master.) 
3024,"GALLEIA: Oh, you! Seize him! Seize him! "
3025,"MASTER: Krasis, the switch! "
3026,"DOCTOR: No, stop him! Stop him! "
3027,(Too late. The white creature appears in the plaza) 
3028,"MASTER: Kronos! I, the Master, welcome you! I, the Master, bid you do"
3029,my will! I command you to destroy these men! Obey me! I command you! I
3030,order you to obey! 
3031,(Kronos hovers over the plaza.) 
3032,DOCTOR: He'll never obey you. Don't you understand yet what you've
3033,done? He's uncontrollable! 
3034,MASTER: Obey! 
3035,(Lightning flashes and the buildings start to fall. People scream and
3036,the Master breaks free of the guards and runs over to grab the large
3037,crystal.) 
3038,"DOCTOR: Jo! Jo, come back! Jo! Jo! "
3039,(The Master gets the large crystal just as Jo leaps onto his back. He
3040,carries her and the crystal into his Tardis.) 
3041,"DOCTOR: Come back, Jo! Come back! Jo! Come back. "
3042,"(The Master's Tardis dematerialises. Galleia frees the Doctor, who runs"
3043,into his own Tardis to follow. Kronos continues to shriek in the air
3044,above Atlantis.)
3045,
3046, [The Master's Tardis]
3047,
3048, (The Master handcuffs Jo to the console.) 
3049,"MASTER: There, Miss Grant. I think we've seen the last of the Doctor."
3050,"Buried for all time under the ruins of Atlantis. You know, I'm going to"
3051,miss him. 
3052,JO: He's not finished. I just know it. 
3053,MASTER: Of course he is. 
3054,"JO: No, you're the one who's finished! Do you think that, that creature"
3055,out there will ever let you control it? 
3056,MASTER: I do so already. He came when I called. You saw that yourself. 
3057,JO: Like a tiger comes when he hears a lamb bleating. 
3058,"MASTER: Nicely put, my dear. You know, that was worthy of the late"
3059,"lamented Doctor himself. You know, I could kick myself for not having"
3060,polished him off long ago. Just think of the future. Dominion over all
3061,time and all space. Absolute power forever. And no Doctor to ruin
3062,things for me. 
3063,"DOCTOR [on scanner]: Don't worry, Jo. "
3064,JO: Doctor! 
3065,DOCTOR [on scanner]: I'll soon sort him out for you. 
3066,"MASTER: Doctor! Why, you must be as indestructible as that wretched"
3067,Tardis of yours! And how exactly do you propose to sort me out? 
3068,"DOCTOR [on scanner]: By making you see reason, and making you destroy"
3069,that crystal. 
3070,"MASTER: Oh? Why should I? I have my Tardis, I have Kronos and I have"
3071,"Miss Grant. Now, my reason tells me that I hold all the cards. "
3072,"DOCTOR [on scanner]: Ah, but there's one card that you've forgotten. "
3073,MASTER: Oh? 
3074,DOCTOR [on scanner]: The trump card. I can stop you whenever I please. 
3075,"MASTER: You are bluffing, Doctor. "
3076,DOCTOR [on scanner]: Am I? How about time ram? 
3077,MASTER: Time ram? You couldn't do it in that old crock. 
3078,DOCTOR [on scanner]: The two Tardis's are operating on the same
3079,"frequency, and our controls are locked together. See for yourself. "
3080,(A dial moves up from 70 towards the warning and danger zones.) 
3081,MASTER: Stop! 
3082,DOCTOR [on scanner]: You know what'll happen if that control goes over
3083,"the safety limit, don't you. Tell him, Jo. "
3084,"JO: The two Tardis's occupy exactly the same space and time, and that"
3085,means that you go 
3086,MASTER: I know very well what it means. 
3087,DOCTOR [on scanner]: Do you? 
3088,MASTER: Yes! Oblivion. 
3089,"DOCTOR [on scanner]: Top of the class. Extinction, total annihilation,"
3090,"for you, the Tardis and the crystal. "
3091,MASTER: And for you and Miss Grant. 
3092,"DOCTOR [on scanner]: Oh yes, of course. But by then, Kronos will be"
3093,"free, and the universe will be saved. "
3094,MASTER: Very well. Go ahead. 
3095,DOCTOR [on scanner]: What? 
3096,MASTER: Go ahead. Time ram! 
3097,JO: You can't be serious? 
3098,MASTER: Do you think I'm going to dance to the Doctor's tune like some
3099,"performing poodle? Look, Doctor, you want to stop me? Try! "
3100,"DOCTOR [on scanner]: Very well. Goodbye, Jo. "
3101,"(The dial climbs to 94, just below the red.) "
3102,MASTER: Well? Why have you stopped? 
3103,DOCTOR [on scanner]: To give you one last chance. 
3104,MASTER: Nonsense! You can't bring yourself to destroy her. Now admit
3105,"it! It's that fatal weakness of yours, Doctor. Pity, compassion. You"
3106,"know, for a moment there, you almost had me believing you. "
3107,"JO: Don't listen to him, Doctor! Think of all those millions of people"
3108,who'll die. Think of all those millions of people who'll never be born.
3109,"Do it, Doctor, quickly! "
3110,"DOCTOR [on scanner]: But Jo, there may be another way. "
3111,"MASTER: Of course there is. The way to immeasurable glory! JO: Goodbye,"
3112,Doctor! 
3113,(Jo reaches for the dial.) 
3114,MASTER: No! 
3115,DOCTOR [on scanner]: Don't do it! 
3116,JO: Too late! 
3117,MASTER: No! 
3118,(The time rotor turns into a bright light. The two Tardis's go quiet
3119,and hang in nothingness. Jo and the Master are out cold on the floor.
3120,She is no longer handcuffed to the console. Jo wakes first.) 
3121,JO: Doctor. 
3122,(Jo leaves the Master's Tardis and crosses the rainbow nothingness to
3123,the police box.)

3125, [Tardis]
3126,
3127, (The Doctor is lying on the floor.) 
3128,JO: Doctor? Doctor? 
3129,DOCTOR: Jo. Are you all right? 
3130,"JO: I'm fine. Dead, of course, but I'm fine. "
3131,DOCTOR: Dead? What are you talking about? You're no more dead than I
3132,am. 
3133,"JO: Well, that's just it. Well, I mean, that's what I mean. I mean,"
3134,"you're dead too, and so's the Master. "
3135,DOCTOR: And I suppose we're all in heaven? 
3136,"JO: Yeah, or somewhere. Hey, come take a look. Come on."
3137,
3138, [Nothingness]
3139,
3140," JO: Groovy, isn't it? "
3141,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, it's fascinating, but somehow I don't think we're in"
3142,heaven. 
3143,"JO: Well, where are we then? "
3144,"DOCTOR: Well, that's just it. I don't know myself. You shouldn't have"
3145,"put us into time ram, Jo. In any case, I was just about to do it"
3146,myself. 
3147,"JO: Oh, really? "
3148,"DOCTOR: Now look, Jo, I. No, not really. "
3149,(Someone coughs. They turn to see a giant female face filling the
3150,space.) 
3151,DOCTOR: Greetings. 
3152,"KRONOS: Your courtesy is always so punctilious, Doctor. "
3153,DOCTOR: You know me? 
3154,KRONOS: Of old. 
3155,"DOCTOR: Well, you must forgive me, but I can't quite place you. "
3156,KRONOS: I am Kronos. 
3157,JO: You? But you're a girl. 
3158,KRONOS: Shapes mean nothing. 
3159,JO: But a little while ago you were a raging monster and an evil
3160,destroyer. 
3161,"KRONOS: I can be all things. A destroyer, a healer, a creator. I'm"
3162,beyond good and evil as you know it. 
3163,DOCTOR: Where exactly are we? 
3164,KRONOS: On the boundary of your reality and mine. You brought
3165,yourselves here. 
3166,"DOCTOR: Yes, the time ram. "
3167,"KRONOS: At the moment of impact, I was released. That saved you and"
3168,took you to the threshold of being. 
3169,"DOCTOR: Well, what now? "
3170,KRONOS: I owe you a debt of gratitude nothing could repay. What would
3171,you wish? 
3172,JO: To go home. 
3173,DOCTOR: In the Tardis. 
3174,KRONOS: You shall. 
3175,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
3176,JO: But what about the Master? 
3177,KRONOS: He stays. 
3178,JO: And what will happen to him? 
3179,"KRONOS: Torment, of course. The pain he has given so freely will be"
3180,"returned to him, in full. "
3181,(The Master comes out of his computer.) 
3182,MASTER: No! 
3183,(The Master falls to his knees.) 
3184,"MASTER: Doctor, please. Please help me. I can't bear it. Please,"
3185,"Doctor, please. "
3186,"DOCTOR: Mighty Kronos, may I ask one last favour of you? "
3187,KRONOS: Name it. 
3188,DOCTOR: His life. His freedom. 
3189,KRONOS: He made a prisoner of me. 
3190,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know. But would you allow us to deal with him in our"
3191,way? 
3192,"KRONOS: I do not understand you, but if that is your desire, so let it"
3193,be. 
3194,"MASTER: Thank you, Doctor. "
3195,DOCTOR: Don't thank me. You're coming back to Earth with us. 
3196,"MASTER: Yes, of course. "
3197,(The Doctor turns and goes into the Tardis. The Master pushes Jo and
3198,runs back to his own.) 
3199,"DOCTOR: No! No! Kronos, stop him! Stop him, Kronos! "
3200,(The Master's Tardis dematerialises.) 
3201,KRONOS: You asked for him to be given his freedom. He has it. 
3202,JO: Here we go again.

3206," (Clad only in a nappy, the little boy refuses the"
3207,food Hyde is trying to feed him with a spoon.) 
3208,"HYDE: Come on, baby Benton. Come on, get it down you. "
3209,RUTH: What are you feeding him on now? 
3210,HYDE: The remains of my lunchtime sandwiches mashed up with some cold
3211,tea. 
3212,RUTH: Stop playing mothers and fathers and come and give me a hand. I
3213,think I'm nearly there. 
3214,HYDE: What are you trying to do? 
3215,"RUTH: Well, if I'm on the beam, we should be able to close the gap in"
3216,"time for good. Right, switch on, Stu. "
3217,HYDE: Okay.
3218,
3219, [Tardis]
3220,
3221," JO: But, why? I mean, why did you even ask? "
3222,"DOCTOR: Jo, would you condemn anybody to an eternity of torment? Even"
3223,the Master? 
3224,"JO: No. No, I guess I wouldn't. "
3225,"DOCTOR: No. Well, neither would I. Even though he was responsible for"
3226,the destruction of Atlantis. 
3227,"JO: It's so terrible though, when you think about it. All those people."
3228,
3229,"DOCTOR: Yes. Right, Jo, we're about to land back in Cambridge. Just"
3230,"think. It all happened three thousand, five hundred years ago."

3235,"HYDE: Three oh, three five, four oh. "

3237,HYDE: Suffering catfish! 
3238,RUTH: Increasing power. 
3239,"HYDE: But Ruth, look! "
3240,"RUTH: Yes, it must be the Doctor. Now concentrate, Stu. Increasing"
3241,power.

3244,RUTH: Isolate matrix scanner. 
3245,HYDE: Five five. Check. 
3246,DOCTOR: What's going on here? 
3247,"HYDE: Six oh, six five, seven oh. "
3248,"RUTH: See if it's working, Stu. "
3249,"(Outside, the soldiers begin to move.) "
3250,"HYDE: Hey. Yes, it is. "
3251,RUTH: Good. 
3252,(TOM-TIT starts to smoke.) 
3253,DOCTOR: It seems to be working a bit too well. 
3254,RUTH: It's running away again. 
3255,"HYDE: Ruth, everybody, get down. It's going to go up! "
3256,(Bang! and time outside returns to normal.)

3258,"RUTH: No, I couldn't. Not without the Professor. Just as well, I guess."

3260,DOCTOR: It's done its job. Everything's now back to normal. 
3261,(The Brigadier bursts in.) 
3262,"BRIGADIER: Right, stand quite still, everyone. Er, where's the Master? "
3263,"DOCTOR: A very good question, Brigadier. "
3264,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, glad to see you're back. Miss Grant, what on Earth"
3265,"are you doing in that extraordinary get-up? And where, for heaven's"
