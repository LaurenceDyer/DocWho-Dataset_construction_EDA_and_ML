22,
23,STEVEN: We're landing now Doctor. 
24,DOCTOR: Good. That means the gravitational bearing must have rectified
25,itself. 
26,(DODO enters.) 
27,"DODO: Hey, look at this! "
28,(Dodo has raided the ship's wardrobe for a trendy new dress. 
29,DODO: Ain't it fab? 
30,"STEVEN: Yes, very nice. "
31,(The Doctor sneezes.) 
32,STEVEN: Bless you. 
33,"DODO: Oh Doctor, don't say you're catching a cold now. "
34,"(But as the young friends turn towards the Doctor, he's nowhere to be"
35,seen.) 
36,"STEVEN: Doctor? Well, where are you? "
37,"DOCTOR: What do you mean, dear boy? I'm still here. "
38,STEVEN: What? 
39,"DODO: Doctor, you've vanished! "
40,"DOCTOR: What? Oh, nonsense, child. Nonsense. "
41,DODO: You have. Do you think this is something to do with the
42,Refusians? 
43,"STEVEN: Well, it must be. "
44,DOCTOR: You're wrong. This is something far more serious. We're in
45,grave danger. This is some form of attack! 
46,STEVEN: But we're still in the Tardis! 
47,"DOCTOR: That may be, my boy, but wherever it is, it has great power and"
48,can penetrate our safety barrier. 
49,(The Tardis has materialised in the centre of an empty octagonal room.)
50,
51,"DOCTOR : Don't just stand there, dear boy, turn on the scanner. "
52,DODO: But Doctor. 
53,"DOCTOR : Don't ask questions, child. There isn't time. Turn on the"
54,scanner. 
55,STEVEN: It isn't working. 
56,"DOCTOR : Yes, it is. When it isn't working, the screen is not as"
57,clear as that. This is part of the same trick. 
58,DODO: But what are we to do? Let's take off at once. 
59,"DOCTOR : That might be worse, my dear. Besides, I'm not only"
60,"invisible, I'm intangible, which means that I can't pull the switches. "
61,"STEVEN: Well, I'll do it if you tell me what to do. "
62,"DOCTOR : No! Whatever it is, we shall have to face up to it. Open"
63,the doors. 
64,"STEVEN: But, Doctor! "
65,DOCTOR : Open the doors! 
66,"(Reluctantly, Steven obeys.) "
67,DODO: We should go. 
68,STEVEN: We can't. 
69,"DODO: Hey, if the Doctor's intangible, why did he need to open the"
70,doors? He could have just walked through them. 
71,"STEVEN: Habit, I suppose. Come on, we should follow. "
72,DODO: You won't get me out there. 
73,(Steven steps outside.)
74,
75,[Toymaker's office]
76,
77,(In a striking office a man is dressed in the
78,"bejewelled robes of a Chinese Mandarin. His surroundings, a strange"
79,"mixture of ultramodern and ornate, include a large desk incorporating a"
80,control panel and an elegant triangular gaming table. Everyone say Hi!
81,to the wonderful  Michael
82,Gough.)
83,TOYMAKER: You'll serve my purpose admirably. You're very good at games.
84,Clowns always are. You can show Steven and Dodo some of your tricks
85,into the bargain. 
86,"(The man has selected a pair of toy clowns, one happy and one sad, from"
87,the nursery of a large Victorian dolls house. The happy one is a girl
88,dressed in a harlequin costume. The sad one is a boy in a white baggy
89,"suit with ruffles and a cone-shaped clown hat. Now, before his eyes,"
90,the dolls begin to grow.)

92,[Toyroom]
93,
94,"DODO: If you want to go, then you go, but I'm sure"
95,that the Doctor would. Doctor! 
96,DOCTOR: Hmm? What is it? 
97,DODO: There you are! 
98,STEVEN: We can see you! Everything's all right. 
99,"DOCTOR: Oh, you can see me? "
100,STEVEN + DODO: Yes! 
101,"DOCTOR: Well, splendid. Splendid. "
102,"DODO: Oh, let's go now. It must have just been the Refusian influence"
103,after all. 
104,STEVEN: What's this extraordinary place? 
105,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm not quite sure, dear boy, but it's, it's somewhat"
106,familiar. 
107,DODO: It looks dead boring to me. Come on. 
108,"DOCTOR: No, wait, child, wait. "
109,DODO: Why? 
110,"DOCTOR: Well, I don't think it was the Refusian's influence that made"
111,"me become intangible. No, I think it was something here, and I don't"
112,like the feel of the place anymore than you do but we have to face up
113,"to it. You know, I think I was meant to come here. "
114,STEVEN: Hey! Look! That's me! 
115,DODO: What is? 
116,"STEVEN: Here, on this screen! "
117,DODO: What screen? 
118,STEVEN: Here! That's me on the planet Kemble. 
119,(To Dodo the screen is blank.) 
120,DODO: There's nothing there. 
121,DOCTOR: But I believe I now know where we are. 
122,STEVEN: It's changed again. There I am in Paris. 
123,"DOCTOR: Now turn around this instant! Turn away from it, dear boy!"
124,"We're now in the world of The Celestial Toymaker, and that screen is"
125,hypnotic. He's trying to dominate your mind. 
126,"STEVEN: But, Doctor. "
127,DOCTOR: There is nothing there. Do you understand me? There is nothing
128,there at all. You must believe me. 
129,STEVEN: What was it? What happened? 
130,"DODO: What's the matter, Doctor? I couldn't see anything on the screen."
131,
132,"DOCTOR: Come here, child. Now whatever you do, you must not allow"
133,yourself to be trapped into looking at it. 
134,DODO: Who's the Celestial Toymaker? 
135,DOCTOR: He's a power for evil. He manipulates people and makes them
136,"into his playthings. Whatever you do, neither of you must look at that"
137,screen. It's a trap. 
138,(In place of the Tardis now stands the Mandarin.) 
139,"TOYMAKER: What a spoil-sport you are, Doctor. They like my memory"
140,window. 
141,DOCTOR: You! I might have guessed. 
142,TOYMAKER: Of course. I've been waiting for you a long time. 
143,DODO: Where's the Tardis? 
144,"TOYMAKER: Don't worry, my dear. Just watch over there. "
145,"(As Dodo looks at the screen, an image appears of a young girl wearing"
146,a school beret.) 
147,DODO: It's me the day my mother died! 
148,DOCTOR: Turn away from it this instant! 
149,STEVEN: Look away. 
150,(Steven pulls Dodo to himself.) 
151,TOYMAKER: What a shame. I thought my little invention would amuse you. 
152,"DOCTOR: You and your inventions, ha! Now, both of you, be very careful."
153,This place is a hidden menace. Nothing is just for fun. 
154,STEVEN: What's the idea of it? 
155,DOCTOR: He's trying to get us into his power. That's why we've got to
156,fight him. 
157,DODO: Well can't we just go? I hate this place. 
158,"DOCTOR: My dear, but how? That is the question. "
159,"DODO: In the Tardis, of course, as always. "
160,TOYMAKER: There are many of them. Take your choice. 
161,"(On screen, rows of Tardises are filing past as if on a conveyor belt.)"
162,
163,STEVEN: There are hundreds of them! 
164,"TOYMAKER: Yes, hundreds. Come, Doctor. "
165,DOCTOR: No! 
166,(Steven and Dodo turn round. The room is completely empty.) 
167,STEVEN: Doctor! 
168,DODO: Have you gone invisible again? 
169,"STEVEN: No, he's gone. That man has taken him away. "
170,DODO: I don't like it. We should never have stayed. 
171,STEVEN: It's too late now. 
172,DODO: Who was that man? 
173,STEVEN: I don't know. But we've got to find the Doctor. 
174,(The only door in the room suddenly opens and two clowns enter the room
175,on tiptoe.) 
176,STEVEN: What on Earth? 
177,DODO: Shhh! Shhh! Steven. 
178,STEVEN: But why have I got to be quiet? 
179,"(Joey, the sad clown offers Steven his hand which comes away in"
180,"Steven's own, as Clara, the happy clown pops a balloon with a hat pin."
181,The newcomers mime convulsive laughter. Dodo giggles.) 
182,STEVEN: Very funny. Don't see what you've got to laugh about. 
183,DODO: If you could only see your face with that hand. 
184,(Joey presents Dodo with a bouquet.) 
185,DODO: For me? (honk) Oh thanks. No one's ever given me flowers before. 
186,"(As she leans in to smell them, a jet of water squirts in her face."
187,It's Steven's turn to be amused.) 
188,STEVEN: If you could just see your face. 
189,DODO: I'm not sure that I like these clowns. 
190,"STEVEN: Look, can either of you talk? (honk) Well, how about you? "
191,"CLARA: (very high pitched) Yes, I can talk. How are you? "
192,(Carmen Silvera long
193,before
194,"'Allo,"
195,Allo.)
196,
197,STEVEN: I'm fine. But what do you want with us? 
198,TOYMAKER: They're here to entertain you. Play a game with you. 
199,"STEVEN: Well, thank you very much. We've been entertained. We don't"
200,want to play your games. Now where have you taken the Doctor? 
201,"TOYMAKER: Taken the Doctor? Nowhere, my dear chap. The Doctor and I are"
202,going to play a little game together. You can watch the results on that
203,board. 
204,(He points to the screen.) 
205,TOYMAKER: But you must win all your games before he does. 
206,"STEVEN: Look, we're not interested in your games. We want to go back to"
207,the Tardis. 
208,TOYMAKER: That's impossible. 
209,STEVEN: Impossible? 
210,"TOYMAKER: Well, not quite impossible, but you'll have to win a few"
211,"games first. After each game, if you win, you will find a Tardis, which"
212,may or may not be the real one. 
213,"STEVEN: What do you mean, the real one? "
214,"TOYMAKER: As you have seen, I have many copies. "
215,DODO: So we have to win a game before we can get to the Tardis. 
216,"TOYMAKER: Right. Several games, in fact. "
217,STEVEN: And if we lose? 
218,TOYMAKER: Then you both stay here as my guests. 
219,"DODO: We'd better play his silly games, Steven. "
220,STEVEN: I don't see why we should humour him. He's obviously around the
221,bend. 
222,"DODO: That's just it. If we don't do as he says, we may never get out"
223,of here. 
224,TOYMAKER: Well? 
225,"STEVEN: All right, we'll play your little games. But if we win, we get"
226,"the Tardis back, okay? "
227,TOYMAKER: Agreed. 
228,STEVEN: And if we lose? 
229,TOYMAKER: You'll never see the Tardis again. 
230,(The Toymaker vanishes.) 
231,STEVEN: Wait! 
232,DODO: You never asked him about the Doctor. 
233,"STEVEN: Oh, he's probably got his game to play. I'm glad we're not"
234,playing that one. 
235,DODO: What are we playing? 
236,CLARA: Blind Man's Buff!
237,
238,[Toymaker's office]
239,
240,(The Toymaker and the Doctor face each other across
241,the triangular table.) 
242,"DOCTOR: You will kindly cease this practical joking, and let us go at"
243,once. 
244,"TOYMAKER: Patience, Doctor, patience. You've only just got here. Relax."
245,It's so nice to see you again. 
246,"DOCTOR: And now you have, so let us go. "
247,"TOYMAKER: You're so innocent, Doctor. The last time you were here, I"
248,"hoped you'd stay long enough for a game, but you had hardly time to"
249,turn around. 
250,"DOCTOR: And very wise I was, too. You and your games are quite"
251,notorious. You draw people here like a spider does to flies. 
252,TOYMAKER: How absurd. It amuses me to give amusement. 
253,"DOCTOR: And should they lose the game they play, you condemn them to"
254,become your toy forever. 
255,"TOYMAKER: That is one of my rules, certainly. But if they win, they're"
256,perfectly free to go. 
257,DOCTOR: And if I refuse? 
258,TOYMAKER: Then you lose by default. Is that what you choose? 
259,"DOCTOR: No, I do not. I should never have left the Tardis. "
260,TOYMAKER: You're so insatiably curious. That's why I ensured that the
261,scanner would be blank. I knew that would bring you out. 
262,DOCTOR: Another one of your conjuring tricks. What game is it you want
263,me to play? 
264,(The Toymaker indicates the table.) 
265,TOYMAKER: This. 
266,"(Each of the three corners is inlaid with a letter, A B and C.) "
267,DOCTOR: The trilogic game? 
268,"TOYMAKER: The trilogic game. A game for the mind, Doctor, the developed"
269,mind. Difficult for the practiced mind. Dangerous for the mind that has
270,"become old, lazy or weak. "
271,DOCTOR: You infer that my mind is getting weak and old? 
272,"TOYMAKER: Well now, we shall see. Perhaps it is merely lazy. "
273,DOCTOR: How dare you. 
274,TOYMAKER: So you still think that you can pit your mind against mine? 
275,DOCTOR: Of course I can. 
276,TOYMAKER: Good. I hope that the time you have spent dabbling in your
277,researches round the universe hasn't dulled you. I need you. 
278,DOCTOR: You need me? 
279,"TOYMAKER: Yes. I'm bored. I love to play games, but there's no one to"
280,play against. The beings who call here have no minds and so they become
281,my toys. But you will become my perpetual opponent. We shall play
282,"endless games together, your brain against mine. "
283,"DOCTOR: As you said, if I win the game, I can go. "
284,"TOYMAKER: So you can, Doctor, so you can. But I think you will lose."
285,Can you remember how to play? 
286,(Ten triangular playing counters stacked in a pyramid now appear on
287,"corner A, with number 1, the smallest, at the top.) "
288,DOCTOR: I am only allowed to move one piece at a time. 
289,TOYMAKER: That is right. And you must rearrange them in the same order
290,that they are now on point C. 
291,DOCTOR: And I am not permitted to put a larger piece on a small piece. 
292,"TOYMAKER: Correct. And you have 1,023 moves to do it in. That is the"
293,"exact amount. If you make one mistake, you lose. And to help you count,"
294,there. 
295,(He indicates a tally recorder.) 
296,"TOYMAKER: When the two rows of numbers match, the game is over. "
297,"(The top row reads 1023, the bottom 0.) "
298,DOCTOR: I see. Can I begin? 
299,"TOYMAKER: Don't be so impatient, Doctor. "
300,(He points to a monitor on the wall.) 
301,TOYMAKER> There. We mustn't forget them. 
302,DOCTOR: You are not asking them to play this game. 
303,"TOYMAKER: Good heavens, no. They are on the competitive quest. "
304,DOCTOR: Competitive? And who are the others? 
305,TOYMAKER: Two clown friends of mine. They are the home team. They will
306,play against your friends and win the quest. 
307,DOCTOR: Quest? What quest? 
308,"TOYMAKER: The hunt for the Tardis. Win the games, and you get it back."
309,
310,[Toyroom]
311,
312,"(Thanks to the efforts of the two clowns, the floor"
313,of the toyroom now resembles a huge board game with a series of
314,obstacles laid out between Start and Home.) 
315,DODO: It's rather like a Snakes and Ladders set I used to have. 
316,STEVEN: Looks crazy to me. 
317,"DODO: Oh, go on, have a go. It looks fun. "
318,"STEVEN: What, me on that? Not on your life. "
319,"DODO: But this is the game we have to play, right? "
320,CLARA: This is your game. 
321,"STEVEN: Right, then you play it. "
322,"CLARA: Oh no! You must play it. It's all quite simple. You start here,"
323,blindfold. 
324,STEVEN: You must be joking. Kids game. 
325,DODO: Steven! Go on. 
326,CLARA: You have to cross these obstacles without falling down. And if
327,"you get home without falling down, you win the game. "
328,STEVEN: And what's old What's-His-Name there going to be doing all this
329,time? 
330,"CLARA: His name is Joey. I'm Clara. He will play it too, of course. "
331,STEVEN: And if he loses? No answer that time. And what happens if we
332,both manage it? 
333,CLARA: Then we play it again until someone loses. 
334,"STEVEN: Oh, it's a great future the Toymaker's got mapped out for us."
335,"All right, chum, you want to show me how it's done? (honk, bell, honk,"
336,"bell) That means yes, I suppose. (honk) "
337,(Clara ties a blindfold over Joey's eyes and guides him onto the start
338,position. The first obstacle is a set of pinnacles over which Joey must
339,swing on a rope.) 
340,CLARA: You must come with me. 
341,(She leads Steven and Dodo into a glass-fronted booth. Inside is a
342,control panel.) 
343,"CLARA: This is where we control them. One buzz for right turn, two for"
344,"left, three to stop, four to start. "
345,"(Buzz buzz buzz buzz. Joey feels for the rope, unties it and swings"
346,"across the pinnacles, landing"
347,"sure-footedly on the first of a series of stepping stones, the second"
348,obstacle. He steps confidently from one stone to the next.)
349,
350, [Toymaker's office]
351,
352,"(Watching the monitor alone, the Doctor finds a"
353,communication switch.) 
354,DOCTOR: Dodo? Steven? This is the Doctor. The game you're going to play
355,is not so innocent as it looks. Be on your guard. 
356,[Toyroom]
357,
358,"DOCTOR : If you lose this game, we shall be"
359,here forever. So watch out for 
360,[Toymaker's office]
361,
362,"TOYMAKER: That was unwise of you, Doctor. "
363,(The Toymaker's flicked the switch.) 
364,DOCTOR: I must warn them. 
365,TOYMAKER: Attend to your own game. Go from move 152. 
366,"(Seemingly of their own volition, the counters and tally move as the"
367,Toymaker has commanded.) 
368,"TOYMAKER: Keep playing, Doctor. And to stop you interfering, I shall"
369,have to dematerialise you again. There. 
370,"(Once again, the Doctor is intangible.) "
371,"DOCTOR : You are overreaching yourself, Toymaker. How can I play"
372,this game? 
373,"TOYMAKER: Let's see. Suppose we leave you one hand, there. I suggest"
374,you resume the game. 
375,(The Doctor's disembodied hand hovers over the table. With great
376,"dignity he takes counter 1 from B and places it on C, then moves"
377,counter 2 from B to A.)
378,"TOYMAKER: I thought you'd see it my way, Doctor."
379,
380,[Toyroom]
381,
382,"(Joey has completed the third and fourth obstacles,"
383,and reaches Home.) 
384,CLARA: We won! We won! 
385,STEVEN: Just a minute. I haven't had a go yet. 
386,DODO: But the Doctor warned us. 
387,"STEVEN: It's all right, I can manage it. Rope, five stones, steps,"
388,"plank, tube. Now I can do it if you can guide me. After all, he can do"
389,it. And you remember the directions? 
390,"DODO: Right, one buzz. Left, two buzzes. Four to start and three to"
391,stop. 
392,"(Leaving Dodo in the booth, Steven positions himself at the start of"
393,the course. Clara ties on his blindfold.) 
394,CLARA: Can you see? 
395,"STEVEN: Not a thing. Right, I'm ready. "
396,(Clara joins Dodo whilst Joey hovers nonchalantly around the course.) 
397,CLARA: Ready now. 
398,(Buzz buzz buzz buzz. As Steven prepares to rope swing across to the
399,"stepping stones, Joey nudges the first stone out of position.) "
400,"DODO: Look what he's doing! Cheat! You cheat! Steven, look out! "
401,CLARA: He can't hear you! The door's self-locking! 
402,(Buzz buzz buzz.) 
403,"STEVEN: Dodo, be careful. You nearly made me fall that time. "
404,(Steven swings across but his feet find nothing on the other side.) 
405,"STEVEN: What have you done now, you clown, you? "
406,"(Honk, buzz) "
407,STEVEN: One right. One right? 
408,"(He swings again, this time landing safely.) "
409,"STEVEN: Phew, that was close. (honk) Yes, you'll honk when I get this"
410,"blindfold off. Now he's moved another. He moved the first to the right,"
411,he's moved the second to the left. 
412,(Buzz buzz buzz.) 
413,"STEVEN: No, what now? (buzz) To the right? (honk) You wait! "
414,"(With Joey continuing to disrupt the course, Steven is forced to listen"
415,carefully to Dodo's signals as he gingerly
416,negotiates the other stones. Buzz buzz. Buzz. Buzz. Eventually Steven
417,steps off the final stone onto a stepladder and sits down to mop his
418,brow.) 
419,DODO: I don't see how he has a chance of winning if you cheat all the
420,time. 
421,CLARA: Cheat? Oh no. It's just a few variations. It makes it more fun. 
422,"(For the next stage, Steven must cross a plank mounted between two sets"
423,"of steps. As he's edging along, Joey tries to distract him.) "
424,STEVEN: What was that? (honk) You again. I warn you! (honk) Games with
425,clowns. 
426,(He reaches the end and begins to climb down. The final obstacle is a
427,large flexible tube which he must pass through in order to reach home.
428,Buzz buzz buzz. Buzz buzz.)
429,DODO: He's far too big to squeeze through that tube. 
430,CLARA: Joey did. 
431,"DODO: But suppose he gets stuck half way, what then? "
432,"(Once Steven has entered the tube, Joey drags the other end round to"
433,form a U shape.) 
434,DODO: Look what he's done! It's not fair! 
435,CLARA: He goes back to the start! 
436,DODO: And you think that's fair? Let me out of here! Open the door! 
437,CLARA: I can't! 
438,"DODO: Oh, you're just like a doll! A rag doll! I don't think this funny"
439,at all. 
440,"(Emerging from the end of the tube, Steven feels for the table marking"
441,"Home. Instead, he finds the steps again.) "
442,"STEVEN: Oh, no! "
443,(He tears off the blindfold.) 
444,"STEVEN: Look, I warned you! "
445,CLARA: We won! We won! 
446,DODO: You cheated. Steven completed the course. 
447,CLARA: We won! Now you'll never find the Tardis! 
448,"STEVEN: Look, it's a draw. Now let's do it again, this time with him in"
449,the booth! 
450,CLARA: The winner! 
451,"DODO: Steven, look at this! You can see right through it. It's not a"
452,real blindfold at all! 
453,(The two clowns look crestfallen.) 
454,STEVEN: No wonder you were able to run round the course so easily. And
455,"now we'll try it again, only this time with a real blindfold. Not so"
456,"fast! Here, put that on him. You'd better go in the booth to guide him."
457,
458,(Clara obeys whilst Dodo ties the genuine blindfold round Joey's head.
459,The room has grown darker and the clowns are suddenly sombre.) 
460,"STEVEN: Right. Now we'll play The Toymaker's little game fairly. Go on,"
461,"Dodo, start him off. "
462,"(Buzz buzz buzz buzz. Joey begins the course once again, guided by"
463,Clara's signals.) 
464,"DODO: Steven, I'm frightened. Have you noticed he's not funny anymore? "
465,(Buzz buzz. Buzz. Buzz. The clown teeters precariously on the plank.) 
466,"DODO: Steven, you'd better stop him. He'll fall. "
467,STEVEN: We can't stop him. It's him or us. Go on. You can't stop now! 
468,"(As Joey continues, his movements grow still and slow, until finally he"
469,"topples over. In the booth, Clara is slumped lifeless over the"
470,"controls. Suddenly all the lights go off, there's a loud thunderclap,"
471,and there illuminated at the far end of the room is the Tardis.) 
472,STEVEN: Come on. 
473,DODO: It can't be empty! 
474,STEVEN: It is. 
475,(There's only a blank cupboard behind the doors.) 
476,STEVEN: Look. 
477,DODO: What's that? 
478,(It's a piece of paper. Dodo reads.) 
479,"DODO: Four legs, no feet, of arms no lack, it carries no burden on its"
480,"back. Six deadly sisters, seven for choice, call the servants without"
481,voice. What does it mean? 
482,"STEVEN: A riddle. Look, here's a way out. "
483,DODO: Perhaps this is to tell us where the Tardis is. 
484,"STEVEN: Or perhaps it's just another game. Anyway, we've got to find"
485,out. 
486,(An exit has opened up at the back of the cupboard. Before following
487,"Steven through, Dodo glances back at the clowns. Twisted wooden dolls"
488,"return to their proper size. With a shudder, she runs from the room.)"

491,of Dolls 
492,[Cupboard]
493,
494,"(Steven and Dodo face yet another panelled door,"
495,this one heavily bolted and with a sign saying 'Pull to open.' One
496,panel shows a numeric display.) 
497,DODO: This is the next game? 
498,STEVEN: No. We'll find the next game behind this door. 
499,DODO: How can you be sure? 
500,STEVEN: Look. 
501,DODO: The Doctor's move recorder for his game. 
502,"STEVEN: Yes, I know. This door's here to delay us. I think we're meant"
503,to try to get it open. The Toymaker's hoping that we'll waste time. 
504,(They undo all of the locks.) 
505,STEVEN: That should do it. It won't open. 
506,"DODO: But it must. What's wrong with it? I know, let's pull instead. "
507,"(They do so, and the door flies open, offering them a view of the first"
508,Chair Room.)

510,[Toymaker's study]
511,
512,(The Doctor's hand makes his 417th move.) 
513,DOCTOR: I haven't made a mistake yet. 
514,"TOYMAKER: Let's hope not, Doctor. I would hate you to end up in my"
515,dolls' house. I reserve that fate for your two friends. 
516,"DOCTOR: They'll win, too. "
517,"TOYMAKER: No, they will lose one game, and then, like the clowns,"
518,"they'll become my toys, and we shall be able to amuse ourselves through"
519,all eternity. 
520,DOCTOR: What do you mean? 
521,TOYMAKER: You remember the agreement? They must find your Tardis before
522,"you finish your game. If they don't, then you will have to stay here"
523,"and you'll be in my power forever. Look, they've already reached their"
524,next test. 
525,DOCTOR: That game? I might have known. 
526,(The hand presses a communicator.) 
527,DOCTOR: Steven! Dodo! Take care. It's chair number 
528,TOYMAKER: You fool! Now I have been forced to make you dumb as well as
529,intangible. You cannot speak until you have reached the second to last
530,"move of the trilogic game. Now then, let them play their games whilst"
531,"you play yours. Go from move 444. And no more clever tricks, if you"
532,please. 
533,"(As the counters move themselves into new positions, the Toymaker"
534,spreads a pack of playing cards on his desk.) 
535,TOYMAKER: Your friends managed to outwit my clowns. I shall have to
536,find more worthy opponents for them. There. I think perhaps the Heart
537,family. They have great experience in a great variety of games. 
538,[First Chair room]
539,
540,STEVEN: The Doctor was trying to warn us. 
541,"TOYMAKER: I'm seriously annoyed with your friend. Once again, he tried"
542,"to talk to you, so I've had to deprive him of his voice. Let it be a"
543,"warning to you. Play the games according to the rules I set, or give up"
544,now. 
545,STEVEN: The rules you set? Your own players break them. They cheat! 
546,DODO: How can we believe anything you say? Everything here is so
547,strange. 
548,STEVEN: We can't even be certain that that was the Doctor's voice we
549,heard at all. It could have been you leading us toward another trap. 
550,TOYMAKER: I'm glad to see you're at last treating me with respect. 
551,"DODO: Only as long as you have the Doctor. After that, we'll see "
552,"STEVEN: Forget it, Dodo, he's gone. "
553,(The room contains three elaborate numbered thrones.) 
554,STEVEN: What odd looking chairs. Perhaps these are what the Doctor was
555,trying to warn us about. 
556,"QUEEN: Is this the room? Is this the room, I said. "
557,(Carmen Silvera in another role.) 
558,"KING: Oh, er I think so, my dear. "
559,(Joey the clown reborn) 
560,QUEEN: And I suppose these are the people we have to play against. 
561,"KING: Hmm? Oh! Oh! Peasants, my dear. "
562,QUEEN: Peasants! 
563,STEVEN: Just a minute. Who do you think you're calling a
564,peasant? 
565,"DODO: Steven, don't you see who they are? "
566,"STEVEN: Well, yes, they do look familiar. "
567,DODO: They're playing cards. We shall play our next game with a couple
568,of playing cards. 
569,"STEVEN: The Toymaker's warped sense of humour, I suppose. "
570,QUEEN: None of these look in the least like your throne. 
571,"KING: Hmmm? No, no, no, they don't, do we my dear. Although the"
572,"Toymaker did say we'd find them in here, didn't he? "
573,STEVEN: What was that riddle again? 
574,"DODO: Er, four legs, no feet, of arms no lack, it carries no burden on"
575,its back. 
576,STEVEN: That must be these chairs. 
577,"DODO: But what about the rest of it? Six deadly sisters, seven for"
578,"choice, call the servants without voice. "
579,STEVEN: Hmmm. Well that can't be the chairs. There are only three of
580,them. 
581,"QUEEN: You're not paying the least attention again. I warned you, if we"
582,"don't find that throne, he'll keep us here. We shall remain playing"
583,cards for the rest of eternity. 
584,"KING: Ah! Very good point, my dear. Yes, yes, we must find the throne. "
585,DODO: What do you make of them? They seem almost like real people. 
586,"STEVEN: Oh, ignore them. They're sent here to distract us. Let's take a"
587,look through here. 
588,QUEEN: Where's that Knave? Cyril! Cyril! Tormenting the Joker again
589,I'll be bound. 
590,"(The Knave of Hearts, Cyril, enters with the Joker. "
591,JOKER: Did you have to give him that sword? 
592,"QUEEN: Quiet, Fool. Cyril, what are you doing? "
593,CYRIL: Nothing. Just playing with the Fool. I'm hungry. 
594,"(This ought to be Gerald Campion aka Billy Bunter, but it's not. Looks"
595,"and sounds very similar though. Younger readers, think Christopher"
596,Biggins. If you must.) 
597,"KING: Ho, ho! The boy's always hungry. "
598,JOKER: He's a pig. 
599,QUEEN: What did you say? 
600,"JOKER: I said, give him a fig. I thought there was a throne to find. "
601,QUEEN: So there is. Where have those peasants gone? 
602,"KING: Hmm? Oh, through that door, my dear. "
603,QUEEN: Why didn't you tell me? 
604,"KING: Well, you never asked, me dear. "
605,QUEEN: We must follow them at once. 
606,KING: Oh. 
607,"QUEEN: Fool, you stay here and look after these chairs. "
608,"KING: Oh, but, now that the Fool is here, don't you think we could have"
609,a joke or two? 
610,QUEEN: No! Come on. 
611,"KING: Oh, well, then, a riddle then? Or a merry quip? "
612,QUEEN: Are you coming? 
613,"KING: Oh, yes, my dear."
614,
615,[Second Chair room]
616,
617,(Steven and Dodo have slipped away down a side
618,passage. They find themselves in a second chair room containing four
619,more chairs numbered from four to seven. Set into the walls are four
620,familiar looking cupboards.) 
621,"STEVEN: Dodo! Four in here, three in there. It must be the chairs. What"
622,"is it? Six deadly sisters, seven for choice. I suppose that means six"
623,of them are dangerous. 
624,DODO: And only one is the right one. 
625,STEVEN: We'll have to find out which one by elimination. But how? And
626,how dangerous are they? 
627,"DODO: No, Steven, don't. "
628,STEVEN: Why? What's wrong? 
629,DODO: Don't risk it. None of the Toymakers' toys are just jokes. Six of
630,these chairs will destroy us. 
631,"STEVEN: It's a charming thought, but you're probably right. But Dodo,"
632,have you noticed all these cupboards? They're all exactly the same
633,shape as the Tardis. 
634,"DODO: Yes, but they could be as dangerous as the chairs. "
635,"STEVEN: No, I don't think so. There are only four, and there weren't"
636,any in the other room. 
637,(He opens the first cupboard. Dodo screams.) 
638,"STEVEN: It's all right, they're only dolls. "
639,DODO: I've got it. We'll use the dolls to sit in the chairs. If we've
640,"got enough that is. That's four here, and these three make up the"
641,seven. 
642,STEVEN: Don't touch them! 
643,DODO: Why? What's wrong? 
644,"STEVEN: Well, they may be dangerous, too. "
645,"DODO: But the riddle said six deadly sisters, and some of these are men"
646,dolls. 
647,STEVEN: What was the last line again? 
648,"DODO: Erm, call the servants without voice. But you can't call someone"
649,without speaking. 
650,"STEVEN: But they haven't got voices. We have. Dolls, come out! Look,"
651,"they must be the servants. Maybe it's some poetic term, the call bit. "
652,"(When none of the mannequins stir, Steven pulls four of them out onto"
653,the floor.) 
654,"STEVEN: Nothing's happened yet. Well, if we can get them all out before"
655,"the king and queen get here, we can test the chairs. "
656,"DODO: Wait. With seven dolls in three cupboards, what's the other one"
657,for? 
658,STEVEN: Perhaps that might be the real Tardis. 
659,"(Whilst they're examining the cupboard the other door slides shut,"
660,leaving three dolls still inside.) 
661,DODO: It won't open. 
662,"STEVEN: Of course, the Doctor's got the key. Come on, look! "
663,(He points to a game tally.) 
664,STEVEN: The Doctor's more than half way through his game already. We've
665,"got to find out what we've got to do here first, quick, before the"
666,others arrive. 
667,"QUEEN: Ah, the peasants again. Caught you in the act. What are you up"
668,to? 
669,"KING: Oh, they seem to be playing with dolls, my dear. "
670,"QUEEN: I can see that. The point is, what are they doing with them? "
671,DODO: They seem very real. We're going to use the dolls to test the
672,chairs. 
673,QUEEN: To test them? 
674,"DODO: Yes. Six of them are dangerous and only one is safe. You know, I"
675,feel very foolish talking to a playing card. 
676,QUEEN: A playing card? 
677,"DODO: Well, aren't you? "
678,"STEVEN: Dodo, it's useless talking to them. They're just products of"
679,the Toymaker's imagination. 
680,QUEEN: We're as real as you are. Henry. 
681,"KING: Oh, er, yes, my dear? "
682,QUEEN: Come here. 
683,"KING: Yes, my dear. "
684,QUEEN: Let this wretched child feel your arm. 
685,KING: Feel my arm? 
686,"QUEEN: There, child. Isn't that an arm? Not much of one, I grant you,"
687,"but nevertheless, a real arm. "
688,"DODO: It is, Steven, these are real people. Feel his arm. "
689,"STEVEN: No, I'll take your word for it. Look, if you're real people,"
690,what are you doing here? And why are you wearing those ridiculous
691,clothes? 
692,"KING: Ah yes, well, it would take a little too long to explain, my boy."
693,"The fact is that we are victims of the Toymaker, the same as you are."
694,"For instance, if I were to sit in this chair. "
695,"QUEEN: Henry, no! We don't know. "
696,"KING: Oh! Oh, no, no, no, we don't, do we? "
697,"QUEEN: We must use the dolls. We'll each choose a doll in turn, and"
698,"then we'll take it in turn to test the chairs, that way we'll find the"
699,answer even quicker. 
700,DODO: We found the dolls. They're ours. And we're supposed to be
701,playing against you. 
702,QUEEN: But that doesn't seem right. There are four dolls and four of
703,us. We must be meant to have one each. That's only fair. 
704,KING: And then we can test the dolls sitting in the chair before doing
705,so ourselves? 
706,"DODO: What do you mean, one each? What about "
707,"STEVEN: It's all right, Dodo. "
708,"DODO: Yes, but what about "
709,"STEVEN: It'll be all right. Now never mind and keep quiet. All right,"
710,go ahead. Choose your dolls. 
711,DODO: But I don't understand. What about the others? 
712,"KING: Oh, no no no, don't fuss yourself, m'dear. The point of the game"
713,"is to see who picks the chair which isn't dangerous, and whoever does"
714,"that is the winner. If it's you, you'll get your Tardis back, and if it"
715,"is us, we get our liberty. "
716,"STEVEN: Now, he's right Dodo. Now go on, choose your doll, and keep"
717,quiet. We'll try our luck in the other room. 
718,"DODO: Oh, very well. "
719,"KING: Oh, are you going, m'dear? "
720,STEVEN: We'll see you later. 
721,QUEEN: I thought we were all supposed to play this game together? 
722,"STEVEN: Well as there are seven chairs, I thought that Dodo and I might"
723,try our luck in the other room. That way we'll all have an equal
724,chance. 
725,"KING: Ah, yes, yes, yes, certainly my boy, yes, anything you like. Yes,"
726,"well, good luck. "
727,"STEVEN: Come on, Dodo. "
728,"DODO: All right, I'm just coming. They're so big. "
729,"(Armed with a doll each, Steven and Dodo take their leave.) "
730,"KING: Charming couple, aren't they? "
731,QUEEN: It isn't very charming to be told you're not real. We were not
732,"amused. Well, which chair do you suggest? "
733,"KING: Yes, well, none of them look like the throne, do they m'dear? "
734,"QUEEN: Well, then you must pick one at random. "
735,"KING: Ah, yes of course, random, yes, yes. Ah, now. "
736,(The King closes his eyes and is about to sit in chair seven.) 
737,"KING; Eenie meenie minie moe, catch a nigger by the toe. Ah! "
738,"QUEEN: No, Henry! Put the doll in it. "
739,"KING: Oh, the doll, yes, quite right, yes, my dear, of course, the"
740,"doll. Ah, here we are then. Now then, we'll take the doll and then."
741,"Oof. I say, it's rather heavy, my dear. Nearly as heavy as I am, I've"
742,no doubt that this will be perfectly good test for the 
743,(A metal clamp secures the doll and it begins to vibrate furiously.) 
744,QUEEN: Henry!

746,[First Chair room]
747,
748,(The Joker and Cyril are asleep in the first room.)
749,
750,"STEVEN: Oh, no. Not more playing cards. "
751,"DODO: They look rather sweet, don't they? A Jack and a Joker. "
752,STEVEN: Leave them alone and concentrate. You nearly gave the game away
753,in the other room. They think that there are only four dolls. Now if
754,"everyone chooses the wrong chair with those dolls, we're going to need"
755,the extra ones to find the right chair. 
756,DODO: Is that fair? They seem quite nice and friendly. 
757,"STEVEN: Can't you understand? We've got to win every game, otherwise"
758,we'll never see the Tardis again. This isn't a children's party. 
759,"DODO: Well, I'm sure if you explained that then the King and Queen"
760,would help us. 
761,"STEVEN: Oh, Dodo, they belong to the Toymaker, remember that. He wants"
762,"to keep us here. At any rate, the Doctor. "
763,DODO: Why? 
764,"STEVEN: I don't know, and it doesn't matter. But we've got to find the"
765,Tardis before the Doctor finishes the game he's playing. Right. Throw
766,your doll into a chair. 
767,DODO: Throw it? 
768,"STEVEN: Yes. Six of these chairs are deadly, remember that. I don't"
769,want to see either of us caught out by one of those. Now throw it. 
770,DODO: Very well. 
771,"(As the doll makes contact with chair number three, there's a blinding"
772,flash.) 
773,DODO: What happened? 
774,STEVEN: It was some sort of electrocution! That could've been us. 
775,DODO: Yes. I see what you mean about this not being a children's party.
776,
777,"CYRIL: A party? Is it tea time, already? Mmmm, I smell crumpets"
778,toasting. What's that? 
779,"DODO: Oh, don't be scared of us. "
780,"(Seeing the burnt doll, the awakened Cyril takes flight down the"
781,passageway.) 
782,"STEVEN: All right, stand by. I'm going to try chair number one. "
783,"(STEVEN throws his doll onto the chair. As it hits, a fearsome blade"
784,"shoots across the back of the chair, cutting the toy in two. Part of it"
785,topples to one side and falls to the floor.) 
786,DODO: It's horrible! The Toymaker must be mad! Do you really think he
787,means to kill us? 
788,STEVEN: What do you think? 
789,"DODO: Well, what do we do now? "
790,"STEVEN: Well, we've got to get the other dolls. We've got to get out of"
791,this place. 
792,DODO: We can't go in there! 
793,STEVEN: Why? 
794,DODO: Or they'll know about the three extra dolls then.

797,
798,(The King's doll is being shaken to pieces.) 
799,"QUEEN: Henry, turn the thing off. "
800,"KING: I don't think I can get near enough, my dear. "
801,CYRIL: I wish you'd stop this silly game! 
802,"KING: Father's a very nice chair here for you, my boy. "
803,CYRIL: Mother! Did you hear what he said? 
804,QUEEN: Henry! 
805,"KING: Well, just a harmless little joke, my dear. Yes, well, I suppose"
806,"we'd better try the doll in it, don't you think? Now then, upsa dazy."
807,We shall try the doll in this chair now. 
808,(He throws the remaining doll onto the chair number four. Both it and
809,the chair slowly fade away.) 
810,"KING: Oh dear! It's, it's disappeared! "
811,"QUEEN: I can see that! Well, that leaves us with chairs number five and"
812,six. What do you propose we do now? 
813,"KING: Well, I suppose we'd better see how that young couple are getting"
814,on in their room. 
815,"QUEEN: Well, they can't have succeeded. We'd have had a visit from the"
816,Toymaker if they had. 
817,"KING: Ah, yes, yes. Oh, we need two more dolls. Ah, yes, a pity. I"
818,"know, the Fool! "
819,"QUEEN: Oh really, Henry. How you can think of entertainment at a time"
820,"like this? Oh yes, of course. I see. The Fool! "
821,"KING: Precisely, my dear. "
822,"(The King offers his arm to the Queen, and they leave the room. Left"

830,"STEVEN: No, it's no use. I can't tell a thing just by looking at it."
831,We'll have to get those other dolls. 
832,DODO: The King and Queen are coming. 
833,"STEVEN: Good, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll try to distract them."
834,You step into the other room and test the chairs. If they're both
835,"deadly, then this must be the right one. "
836,"KING: Ahh! Still one chair left to try, I see. "
837,"QUEEN: Why don't you try it, girl? "
838,DODO: Why don't you? 
839,STEVEN: Haven't you had any luck either? And no more dolls. Well it
840,"looks like stalemate, doesn't it? "

842,you'll excuse the expression.

848,QUEEN: Advice? From a Fool? 
849,"KING: We still have to pick a throne, my dear. Ah, now then, my dear"
850,"fellow, for instance, what do you think of this chair? "
851,"STEVEN: No, you don't. Not this one. "
852,"DODO: Steven, the cupboard with the other three dolls. It's locked. I"
853,can't open it. 
854,STEVEN: But you must. It was open before. 
855,QUEEN: Three more dolls? 
856,KING: And you kept them from us? 
857,QUEEN: Cheats! 
858,"KING: Oh, dear, dear. "
859,"STEVEN: Oh, you can talk after what you were about to do to this poor"
860,fellow. 
861,JOKER: Poor fellow? What's that? 
862,"KING: Oh, nothing, my dear chap. Now, er, come with us. We can't leave"
863,you in such company. 
864,QUEEN: Certainly not. 
865,"KING: Come on, my dear fellow. "
866,"QUEEN: Come, Cyril! "
867,(The four playing cards proceed to the second chair room.) 
868,STEVEN: Now you've done it. You've handed them the game right on a
869,"platter. If this isn't the real chair, we've lost the game. "
870,DODO: I don't see that. 
871,"STEVEN: Look, they've got two more chairs to test. They get the Joker"
872,"to sit on one. If this isn't the right chair, then the other one must"
873,be. 
874,"(Steven turns away in disgust. Dodo looks at him sadly, then moves over"
875,to chair number two and starts to sit down.) 
876,[Toymaker's office]
877,
878,TOYMAKER: You've been moving along very
879,satisfactorily. It's especially commendable considering that young Dodo
880,has chosen to sit in the wrong chair. The freezing chair.
881,
882,[First Chair room]
883,
884,"STEVEN: Dodo, you fool! "
885,"DODO: Steven, I feel cold all the way through. "
886,STEVEN: Stand up. 
887,DODO: Help me. I'm freezing. I can't move. 
888,STEVEN: Stand up. 
889,DODO: I can't! 
890,"STEVEN: Look, try. You must. You must try. "
891,"DODO: I think I'm turning to ice, Steven. "
892,"STEVEN: Fight the cold. Fight it, Dodo. You've got to get out of that"
893,chair. Now fight it! 
894,DODO: It's no use. 
895,"STEVEN: Look, you must try. We've got to concentrate together. "
896,DODO: We can't. 
897,STEVEN: We must. Now! 
898,"(She grasps his outstretched hand, and he too begins to freeze. Yet"
899,with great effort he manages to pull Dodo away.) 
900,"DODO: Oh, thank you. You did it. "
901,"STEVEN: Oh, we did it together. "
902,"DODO: Oh no, I couldn't do a thing. I couldn't move. "
903,STEVEN: Thank goodness you're safe. The Doctor would never have
904,forgiven me if anything had happened to you. 
905,"DODO: But, Steven, we've lost. "
906,[Second Chair room]
907,
908,"KING: Well, there's a much better choice in here."
909,Now give us your honest opinion. Which is the better chair? 
910,"JOKER: Well, sire, I think, er, perhaps that one. "
911,"KING: Number six? Good, good. Well, it is not possible really to test a"
912,chair by just looking at it.
913,"QUEEN: Well, come on, Fool. We haven't got all day. "
914,"JOKER: Oh, poor fellow. Poor fellow. "
915,(The Joker stops and turns to look at the giggling Knave.) 
916,JOKER: What's he laughing at? 
917,"QUEEN: He wasn't laughing, were you? "
918,JOKER: And they call me a fool. 
919,"KING: Well, look, sit down, my dear fellow. "
920,"JOKER: Oh, not on your life, sire. A joke's a joke. I'm giving notice."
921,You can try out your chairs for yourself. 
922,(The Joker leaves hurriedly. The King moves threateningly towards
923,"Cyril, who takes flight after the Joker.) "
924,"KING: Huh, Your son, I think, my dear. "
925,"QUEEN: Well, what do you propose we do now? "
926,"KING: Well, there's nothing else for it. You'll have to try out the"
927,chair. 
928,QUEEN: I? 
929,"KING: Well, one of us will have to. I know, we'll draw matches. "
930,"QUEEN: No, I don't trust your matches. We will toss for it. Heads! Ah! "
931,"KING: You forget, my dear. I know that coin. It's got two heads. "
932,QUEEN: Then. 
933,KING: We will both sit in it. 
934,"QUEEN: And if we go, we go together. "
935,KING: My love. 
936,"(Hand in hand, they walk across to chair number six and sit down.) "
937,KING: Nothing happened. 
938,QUEEN: It's all right. 
939,KING: We worried for nothing. 
940,(Suddenly the chair collapses inwards. Steven and Dodo return to find
941,the Hearts imprisoned.) 
942,"DODO: Oh, the poor things. We must help them. "
943,"STEVEN: No, not now. "
944,DODO: You mean? 
945,STEVEN: That must be the one. 
946,(He sits on chair number five. There's a thunderclap.) 
947,DODO: We've won! There's the Tardis! As soon as the Doctor wins his
948,"game, we can go! We're safe! Oh, no, it can't be. It's got to be the"
949,real one. Look! It's happened again. 
950,STEVEN: It's another of those that the Toymaker's made. Nothing.
951,"Absolutely nothing. Well, what now? "
952,"DODO: You know, we never really solved that last riddle. Call the"
953,servants without voice. 
954,"STEVEN: No. Let's try again. You never know. Dolls, dolls, wherever you"
955,"are, come out! "
956,(The telephone in the police box rings. Steven answers it.) 
957,"TOYMAKER : You're doing better than I thought, but don't rest on"
958,your laurels. The Doctor is succeeding even faster than you. Time and
959,luck are running out. Here is the next clue. Hunt the key to fit the
960,"door that leads out on the dancing floor, then escape the rhythmic"
961,"beat, or you'll forever tap your feet. "
962,STEVEN: But. 
963,DODO: He's gone. 
964,(Dodo looks around. All that remains of their opponents is two playing
965,cards.) 
966,"DODO: Steven, look. "
967,STEVEN: I said that's all they were. Never mind that now. The next
968,game. Come. 
969,(They dive into the darkened passage which has appeared beyond the fake
970,"Tardis. As they go, Dodo calls out.) "
971,"DODO: Dolls, dolls, wherever you are, come out! "

973,dolls follow jerkily through the waiting police box door.)

980,"TOYMAKER: I congratulate you, Doctor, on your"
981,choice of friends. A very astute couple. Neither of my teams have been
982,able to beat them yet. I think they have earned a little amusement.
983,"Now, what have we here to amuse them? "
984,(The Toymaker selects two figures from the dolls house kitchen.) 
985,TOYMAKER: Ah. Sergeant Rugg and Mrs Wiggs. These then are who Steven
986,will find behind the door.

989,
990,(Steven and Dodo are indeed up against a solid
991,door.) 
992,"STEVEN: Useless. No sign of a door handle, latch, or lock. We're stuck"
993,here. 
994,"DODO: Steven, the servants, they're following us! "
995,STEVEN: Huh? 
996,"DODO: The servants without voice, they've come! They scare me. "
997,STEVEN: They're only dolls. 
998,DODO: We called them. Perhaps we can make them go back to their
999,"cupboard. Dolls, go back. Go back to your cupboard! "
1000,STEVEN: I'll stop them. 
1001,"DODO: Steven, be careful. You don't know what they might do. After all,"
1002,we helped destroy the other four dolls. 
1003,STEVEN: Perhaps we can edge past them. 
1004,(The three dolls spread out across the tunnel.) 
1005,DODO: We can't get past them now. 
1006,STEVEN: At least they've stopped. I'm going to try. You follow me. 
1007,DODO: Look! 
1008,"(The heavy door has swung open. With the dolls now stock still, Dodo"

1014,kitchen occupied by a ruddy-faced policeman and a
1015,familiar looking household cook.) 
1016,"STEVEN: Be careful, Dodo, it might be a trap. "
1017,"RUGG: A trap? In here? In Mrs Wiggs' kitchen? Hey, you want to watch"
1018,"your language young fellow, me lad. "
1019,"WIGGS: Here, what do you want in my kitchen? "
1020,"(Guess who, again.) "
1021,DODO: We're looking for the next game. Perhaps you could help us. The
1022,"clue goes, Hunt the key to fit the door that leads out on the dancing"
1023,"floor. Then escape the rhythmic beat, or you'll forever tap your feet. "
1024,WIGGS: The only dancing floor what I know of is through there. 
1025,DODO: Thank you. 
1026,(She's pointing to an old oak door with a large lock and keyhole.) 
1027,"RUGG: All right, young fellow me lad, no loitering! Pick your feet up"
1028,"then! Hup two three four, hup two three four. "
1029,STEVEN: Why don't you go back in your box? 
1030,"RUGG: What's that? Why, you young whipper snapper, I'll er "
1031,STEVEN: You'll what? 
1032,"RUGG: Well, I'll er, well you need a good hiding, me lad. "
1033,STEVEN: And who's going to give it to me? 
1034,"WIGGS: And no fisticuffs in my nice clean kitchen, Sergeant, if you"
1035,please. 
1036,"RUGG: Oh ho, it's a good thing you spoke just then, Cook. No tellin'"
1037,what I mighten' a done to him if you hadn't stopped me. 
1038,"WIGGS: Oh, you're a terrible man when you're riled, Sergeant. "
1039,"RUGG: Well, army trainin', Cook. Six years with the Iron Duke. "
1040,DODO: We've got to get in there. That's what the clue says. The Tardis
1041,must be on the dance floor. 
1042,STEVEN: How the Toymaker expects us to play his crazy games when he
1043,"locks all the doors, I don't know. "
1044,RUGG: I'd like to have 'im in my mob. Just give me a month. I'll make a
1045,man of him. 
1046,STEVEN: What was that? 
1047,"RUGG: Er, well, er, not that he needs makin' a man of, but, er, sharpen"
1048,him up a bit like.

1050,"DODO: Honestly, Steven. If they're not real, how can you lose your"
1051,"temper with them? You can't have it both ways, you know. "
1052,"STEVEN: Oh, all right. I'll ignore them. They're just sent here to get"
1053,my goat. But where do we go from here? We're stuck. 
1054,"RUGG: Ha, ha, the Iron Duke wouldn't have been stuck over a little"
1055,thing like that. 
1056,"STEVEN: All right, I'm ignoring him. "
1057,DODO: What would the Iron Duke have done? 
1058,"RUGG: Well, 'e'd have had another look at the riddle, I expect. "
1059,"DODO: The riddle? Then escape the rhythmic beat, or you'll forever tap"
1060,your feet. 
1061,"WIGGS: No, not that bit, duck. The first bit. "
1062,"DODO: Hunt the key to fit the door, that. Steven, that's it. "
1063,STEVEN: Then the game is - 
1064,RUGG: Hunt The Thimble! 
1065,DODO: Only it's a key. And a rather large one at that.

1084,DODO: Wasn't he the Jack of Hearts? 
1085,"STEVEN: Possibly, but does it matter? I mean all the Toymaker's"
1086,creations look alike to me. We have to find the Tardis before the
1087,"Doctor reaches move 1,023, so we haven't got long to find that key."
1088,It's hot! 
1089,WIGGS: So what'd you expect? You come away from me pots and pans. 
1090,"DODO: Look, we've got to find the key to that door. "
1091,"WIGGS: Well, he won't find it there. "
1092,DODO: How do you know? 
1093,"RUGG: Because Mrs. Wiggs always knows what's best, that's why. "
1094,(Steven picks Cyril up off the chair - this is no mean feat - and
1095,checks underneath him for the key. Dodo meanwhile sidles over to
1096,Sergeant Rugg.)

1114,"RUGG: Dodo. Oh, what a lovely name, Dodo. Oh, I like that. "
1115,"WIGGS: Well, you go and like it somewhere else, and take your friend"
1116,with you. 
1117,"RUGG: Oh, come, Mrs Wiggs. The girl's been and gorn and lost her key. "
1118,"WIGGS: Well, she won't find it here. "
1119,"STEVEN: Take no notice of them, Dodo. They've been sent here by the"
1120,Toymaker to put us off. This time we're getting warm. 
1121,(Mrs Wiggs returns to her pastry board unaware that Steven is searching
1122,under the table.)

1124,STEVEN: It isn't under the table. 
1125,WIGGS: When you've quite finished. 
1126,"STEVEN: Dodo, take a look behind that thing. I'll take a look over"
1127,here. 
1128,(Dodo climbs onto a chair in order to search behind the top of the
1129,dresser.) 
1130,"RUGG: 'Ere, now, wait a minute, girl. You don't want to get up there."
1131,"You'll fall and break your leg. Eh, let me look for you. "
1132,DODO: That's very kind of you. 
1133,"RUGG: Oh, not at all, ma'am. Happy to be of - oop - service. "
1134,WIGGS: Sergeant Rugg! What do you think you're doing of up there? 
1135,"RUGG: Now don't you worry, Mrs Wiggs. I'll be all right. "
1136,WIGGS: I'm not worried about. It's my best china! (smash) Oooh! Oh! Me
1137,best plate! 
1138,"RUGG: A little accident, Mrs Wiggs. "
1139,WIGGS: Accident? That was no accident! You dropped that plate
1140,deliberate like! 
1141,"RUGG: I hope you're not calling me a liar, Mrs Wiggs - oop! "
1142,"WIGGS: Oh! Another accident, I suppose! "
1143,"DODO: Oh! Oh, perhaps you'd better come down, Sergeant. "
1144,"RUGG: Oh don't you worry, miss. It's perfectly all right. "
1145,(More crashing sounds.) 
1146,WIGGS: Oh! Sergeant Rugg! You come down here this instant! 
1147,"RUGG: Soldiers don't take orders from civilians, Cook. Now you just"
1148,pipe down! 
1149,WIGGS: Pipe down? You great oaf. You couldn't fight a pussycat! 
1150,"RUGG: You didn't ought to have of said that, Cook. "
1151,"(More smashing sounds. The ensuing orgy of destruction wakes Cyril, who"
1152,takes refuge under the table.) 
1153,WIGGS: Oh! Oh! Oh Sergeant Rugg! Just you wait till I make you sorry
1154,for that. If you think I'm going to stand for you throwing my best
1155,china about you're very much mistaken! Take that! 
1156,"DODO: Oh, please, please stop. This is all my fault. "
1157,(The argument carries on in the background.) 
1158,"STEVEN: Dodo, ignore them! This is all being done to prevent us from"
1159,"finding the key. They don't really exist, remember? It's not real. "
1160,WIGGS: What did he say? 
1161,DODO: Are you sure about that? 
1162,"STEVEN: Oh, come on. We've got to find that key. That is supposing"
1163,"there is one. We've looked everywhere, haven't we? "
1164,DODO: But I'm afraid it's all my fault/ 
1165,STEVEN: Nonsense! This is another distraction laid on by the Toymaker
1166,to stop us finding the key. 
1167,"DODO: Oh, where? You said it was just a distraction, and "
1168,"STEVEN: They seem to get rougher as they go along, but we've looked"
1169,everywhere. Do you suppose there really is a key? 
1170,"(At opposite ends of the kitchen table, the Sergeant and Mrs Wiggs are"
1171,using food as missiles.) 
1172,"WIGGS: Take that, and that, and that, and that, and that! "
1173,"DODO: Oh, look! You've thrown just about all the buns there are to"
1174,throw. Couldn't you both call a truce? 
1175,WIGGS: A truce? After he broken me best china? 
1176,"DODO: Well, I'm sure he'll apologise. "
1177,RUGG: Apologise? 
1178,MRS. WIGGS: Oh! 
1179,"DODO: Oh, well, you did break her plates, you know. "
1180,RUGG: Soldiers never apologise. It's a rule. 
1181,DODO: But a gentleman would always apologise to a lady. 
1182,WIGGS: Huh! Soldiers! A gentleman! 
1183,"DODO: Sergeant Rugg is, I'm sure of that. "
1184,RUGG: I apologise. 
1185,DODO: There. Now will you accept his apology? 
1186,"WIGGS: Oh, all right then. But he has to pay for my china! "
1187,"RUGG: Pay for the ch? Now then, you see why soldiers never apologise?"
1188,Give the old trout an inch.
1189,"WIGGS: Old trout, is it??!! Just you wait for that, Sergeant Rugg! Old"
1190,trout! 
1191,"RUGG: Now then, careful with that broom, Mrs. Wiggs Careful. "
1192,"(As hostilities resume, Steven catches Cyril trying to sneak off.) "

1197,"Oh, so we're getting somewhere at last, are we? "
1198,(Cyril locks himself inside the pantry.) 
1199,"STEVEN: Hey, you, come back here! "
1200,DODO: I'm sure you'll hurt him with that broom! 
1201,"RUGG: Well, if she does, then this pie'll get hurt as well. "
1202,WIGGS: What? Not that pie. Not that pie! Put it down! 
1203,"RUGG: Oh? Well then, you put that broom down, Missus. "
1204,STEVEN: What's she so worried about this pie for? Look at the rest of
1205,the mess. 
1206,"DODO: Steven, that's one place we haven't looked. "
1207,STEVEN: Where? 
1208,DODO: In the pie! 
1209,STEVEN: I see what you mean. 
1210,(In the excitement the pie is smashed at Dodo's feet.) 
1211,"DODO: Steven, the key! I've got it! "
1212,"STEVEN: Come on, Dodo, be quick! "
1213,DODO: Goodbye! Sorry about your kitchen.

1216,"TOYMAKER: Wretched pair! I give you a chance of life, and this is what"
1217,you do with it. Look at the kitchen! 
1218,"RUGG: My fault, sir, not her's. "
1219,"TOYMAKER: Such gallantry from a mere doll. Now listen to me, the pair"
1220,"of you. Clean yourselves up, and get out onto that dance floor. At the"
1221,far end you will find a Tardis. Steven and Dodo must be prevented from
1222,"getting to it at all costs. Do you understand? If you fail me, I will"
1223,break you in pieces like this.

1231,familiar police box form is revealed.)

1233,(Steven is about to step onto the floor.) 
1234,"DODO: Steven, be careful. This could be as dangerous as those chairs. "
1235,STEVEN: But there's no other way of getting to it. 
1236,"DODO: It can't be as simple as that, can it. There must be a catch"
1237,"somewhere. Then escape the rhythmic beat, or you'll forever tap your"
1238,feet. What does it mean? 
1239,(Steven holds out his hand cautiously over the dance floor and music is

1247,"going, miss. "
1248,"WIGGS: Oh, Sergeant's going to take me to the ball. "
1249,DODO: The ball? 
1250,"RUGG: Yeah, right here, girl. No lack of partners, as you can see. Oh"
1251,"they never get tired of dancing, them dolls. "
1252,"STEVEN: Well, it seems all right. I'm going to make a dash for it. "
1253,(He steps on the rostrum and immediately the music begins.) 
1254,"DODO: Steven, this is no time for a dance. "
1255,STEVEN: I can't help myself!

1263,"mistake. Still, we'll find that out when you reach your 1,023 move.) "
1264,(The Doctor's hand moves counter 2 onto counter 5 and then 1 onto 2.) 
1265,TOYMAKER: I see that Steven has taken time off from the quest to go

1272,dolls.) 
1273,DODO: Get away from it. You must! The riddle warned us it would be
1274,forever. 
1275,STEVEN: I can't! It's holding me in a grip like steel! Get away from
1276,"the floor, Dodo. Go back! "
1277,DODO: But then we can't reach the Tardis! 
1278,STEVEN: I'll try to dance nearer to it! 
1279,RUGG: Not a bad dancer for a civilian. 
1280,"WIGGS: Make a lovely partner for you, ducks. "
1281,"DODO: Can't you dance down to it, Steven? "
1282,STEVEN: I can't lead! I'm just being carried round and round. 
1283,DODO: Then I'm going to try and reach it. 
1284,STEVEN: What are you doing? Go back. 
1285,DODO: I can't! 
1286,(Dodo is also caught up in the dance.) 
1287,"RUGG: Now that we're dancing, what was it the Toymaker wanted us to do?"
1288,
1289,WIGGS: Reach that big cupboard up there before them. 
1290,"RUGG: Ah, well, what about that doll there, then. "
1291,"WIGGS: Ah, that's the game, duck. You dance with her, while I run for"
1292,the cupboard up there. 
1293,"RUGG: Oh, beggin' your pardon, Mrs W, this is man's work. You dance,"
1294,"and I'll run. Well, to be quite frank with you, Mrs W, soldiers don't"
1295,"dance. Well, officers, perhaps. But sergeants, no. Here, why don't you"
1296,try the floor? 
1297,(She does. The dolls change partners.) 
1298,"STEVEN: Dodo, keep close to me. "
1299,DODO: Why? 
1300,STEVEN: Don't ask questions. 
1301,"WIGGS: Oh, hurry up, Sergeant, I can't keep it up for long. "

1307,to the cupboard! 
1308,RUGG: I can't! 
1309,"STEVEN: He's going, Dodo. We must get nearer the Tardis. "
1310,DODO: He's bound to try and stop us somehow. 
1311,"STEVEN: Well, we'll be ready for them. We're almost there. Concentrate"
1312,now. Here we are! 
1313,"(Dancing in each other's arms, Steven and Dodo reach the police box"

1319,"STEVEN: Huh, it's another fake. I wonder how many"
1320,of these things he made? 
1321,DODO: Far too many. I'm beginning to wonder if we'll ever see the real
1322,one again. We might be shut in here forever. 
1323,"STEVEN: No, of course we'll find it. Come on, don't lose heart now."
1324,We've been through too much. How on earth do we get out of this thing? 
1325,DODO: I wonder if we'll ever see the sergeant and the cook again? They
1326,"were rather funny, you know. "
1327,"STEVEN: Look, you still believe in these creations of the Toymaker,"
1328,"don't you? You can't see that they're just phantoms, things created in"
1329,his mind. 
1330,"DODO: If that's so, why do they lose to us? And always through doing"
1331,something silly and human? 
1332,"STEVEN: Oh, I don't know. Maybe they get out of his control. "
1333,"DODO: There, that's just what I meant. "
1334,STEVEN: What are you talking about? 
1335,"DODO: Look, he can bring them to life, but they have wills and minds of"
1336,their own. I'll never be able to look at a doll or a playing card again
1337,with an easy mind. They really do have a secret life of their own. 
1338,STEVEN: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! We've got to get you out of here and quick! 
1339,DODO: Why? What do you mean? 
1340,STEVEN: This place is beginning to get you. 
1341,"DODO: Oh, rubbish! Just because you can't see it. "
1342,STEVEN: We've got to find the next clue. Now there isn't even a
1343,telephone here. It must be in here somewhere. 
1344,"DODO: Still, can't help wondering what happened to them. "

1353,they must not win the next game. 
1354,"(The Toymaker throws his dolls into the chest, one by one.) "
1355,TOYMAKER: Clowns! Nursery characters! Playing cards! I was foolish to
1356,"trust you to play my games for me. You're all too human, too kind. I"
1357,must find a more deadly character. 
1358,(He takes out the Cyril doll.) 
1359,TOYMAKER: Ah! The most deadly character of them all because he looks so

1392,(There's an electrode attached to his wrist.) 
1393,STEVEN: Take the thing off. 
1394,"CYRIL: Oh, all right. There. "
1395,STEVEN: Any more of these schoolboy jokes on you? 
1396,CYRIL: I don't know why you're carrying on like this. I'm just trying
1397,to be friendly.

1430,"CYRIL: Well, here we are. Here's the next game. Tardis Hopscotch. "
1431,STEVEN: What are we supposed to do with it? 
1432,"CYRIL: Well, it's very simple, really. You see, each player takes one"
1433,"of these dice, and throws them onto the triangles, and the number that"
1434,"you've thrown will appear up at the end there, on the dice indicator."
1435,(a rotating barber's pole) That's to make absolutely certain that no
1436,one can cheat. And you move forward the number that you've thrown. The
1437,"first one to reach triangle fourteen's the winner. Easy, isn't it? "
1438,STEVEN: It's too easy. What's the catch? 
1439,CYRIL: No catch. First one home's the winner. 
1440,STEVEN: That gives us a two to one chance over you. 
1441,"CYRIL: Why, so it does. Well, there you are. You just jump from"
1442,triangle to triangle and the first one home wins. 
1443,STEVEN: Why do we have to jump? 
1444,"CYRIL: Well, you can walk if you like, but I shouldn't if I were you. "
1445,STEVEN: Why not?

1479,"CYRIL: Yes, go on."
1480,"STEVEN: One, two. "
1481,"CYRIL: Oh, by the way, I should have told you. If you land on a"
1482,"triangle that's already occupied, the first player has to go back to"
1483,the starting post. 
1484,"STEVEN: Now I see why you let us go first. All right, go on, don't keep"

1486,"CYRIL: It's all part of the game, old chap. Two. One, two. "

1492,"CYRIL: If you don't abide by the rules, you can't possibly win the"
1493,game.

1500,"(When Steven gets to number 1, the buzzer sounds and it's miss a turn.)"
1501,
1502,STEVEN: What's that mean? 
1503,CYRIL: He's pretending he doesn't understand the rules. Wizard sense of
1504,"humour. You go back a turn. My turn now, I think. Ah! A three. One,"
1505,"two, three. I'm still right behind you."

1516,speak?

1528,nearly fell off. 
1529,"CYRIL: It's all part of the game, old chap. Now you can go back to the"
1530,start for cheating. 
1531,"DODO: That's not fair, is it? "
1532,CYRIL: Certainly! He moved out of his triangle and it wasn't his turn.
1533,"And I've landed on your triangle, so you can both go back to the start."
1534,
1535,STEVEN: I've had enough of this. He makes up the rules as he goes
1536,"along. Come on, Dodo. I'm going to the finish line. I want to see if"
1537,that's the real Tardis or not.

1543,DODO: We're not giving up.

1546,"(He tries to leap to the next triangle, but encounters an invisible"
1547,wall.) 
1548,STEVEN: It's no good. It's some sort of invisible barrier. 
1549,TOYMAKER: Precisely. A barrier that yields only to those who play the
1550,game according to the rules. So perhaps you'll go back to the platform
1551,where you started?

1557,backside. 
1558,DODO: Better not. Who's turn is it? 
1559,"STEVEN: Mine. Ah, that's better. Six. One, two (and wobbles on landing)"

1587,(Cyril puts a slippery powder around the edge of his number 11.)

1590,"DODO: Two, three, four, five, six. (She's on 10) Now I only need four"
1591,to get home.

1593,"Oh, two. One, two. "

1598,"three, four. "
1599,"STEVEN: That's better. Now come on, Dodo, you must throw a four. "
1600,(Cyril wails.) 
1601,"DODO: Steven, do you think he's really hurt? "
1602,STEVEN: It's another trick. Roll the dice. 
1603,"DODO: Look, he's bleeding. He's hurt his foot. We can't just leave him."

1609,"CYRIL: Of course it is. You're so easy to fool, you are. Now you can go"
1610,"back to the start for getting out of your triangle, and miss a turn."
1611,That means it's my turn now! 
1612,"DODO: Well, of all the spiteful things! "

1614,I've won! Yaroo! Hoorah for me! 
1615,"(In his eagerness, he goes too fast and slips on the powder he put on"

1619,DODO: What happened? 
1620,"STEVEN: I don't know. Poor old Cyril. Hey, this triangle's covered in"

1641,"DOCTOR: No. Not yet. Excuse me. (switches on the monitor) Yes, I see"
1642,"Steven and Dodo have found the Tardis. One little trick, and your"
1643,little trick is broken. I am now visible. 
1644,"TOYMAKER: You are indeed, Doctor. Well done. The three of you have won"
1645,your little games. 
1646,"DOCTOR: I am glad you take it so calmly. Well now, if you will excuse"
1647,"me, I will go and see if the Tardis is all right."
1648,
1649, [Game room]
1650,
1651,DODO: Just suppose this isn't the real one. 
1652,"STEVEN: Look, it must be! If it wasn't, something would have happened"
1653,by now. And listen. 
1654,DODO: What? 
1655,STEVEN: It's humming. Only the real Tardis does that. 
1656,DODO: Are you sure the Toymaker couldn't have made one of his a humming
1657,one? 
1658,STEVEN: Why didn't he make the others do it? 
1659,"DOCTOR: Well done, my boy. "
1660,STEVEN: Doctor! 
1661,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm back with you. Well done. I'm very glad to hear that"
1662,you're bringing logic into your guesses. 
1663,"DODO: Oh, you're safe. You've won your game. "
1664,"DOCTOR: Yes, my dear, and I think it was high time that we were off. "
1665,STEVEN: I can't wait to leave this place. I don't want to play another
1666,game ever. 
1667,"DOCTOR: Well, I don't think that's going to be likely, dear boy. "
1668,TOYMAKER : I hope I do not interrupt the council of war. 
1669,"DOCTOR: Oh, my dear friend, don't waste our time on trivial"
1670,"formalities. You have been defeated, so now leave us alone. "
1671,DODO: You know you must lose in the end. 
1672,"TOYMAKER : Only I can win. If I lose, the Doctor and I go"
1673,down together. 
1674,"DOCTOR: Now don't start red herrings, you charlatan. "
1675,"TOYMAKER : Go on, young people, go on. Ask your elderly"
1676,friend if he can win completely. 
1677,"STEVEN: Is it true, Doctor? Are we bound to fail? "
1678,"DOCTOR: No, my dear boy. He's just tricking us into despair. Take no"
1679,notice of him. 
1680,"TOYMAKER : Tell them the truth, Doctor. Hide nothing. "
1681,DODO: You must tell us. We ought to know. 
1682,"DOCTOR: Well, I am compelled to tell the truth. It is possible that the"
1683,"Toymaker can drag us down in defeat with him, unless "
1684,STEVEN: Unless what? 
1685,"DOCTOR: Well, it's all very simple. It's a matter of the battle of our"
1686,brains. 
1687,"DODO: Well, do we have a chance to escape? "
1688,"DOCTOR: Yes, we still have a chance, but we must proceed with cunning. "
1689,TOYMAKER : An impossible task. 
1690,"STEVEN: As long as we defeat you, that's all I care. You can't beat us"
1691,now. 
1692,TOYMAKER : We shall see. 
1693,"DOCTOR: Well said, my boy, well said. "
1694,TOYMAKER : Well said? He doesn't even know what he is
1695,saying. These adolescent expressions of loyalty. Before you make
1696,"puerile promises, remember the past, your little adventures. Remember"
1697,my power. 
1698,"STEVEN: Your power? We won through, didn't we? "
1699,(The Toymaker is there in person.) 
1700,"TOYMAKER: Perhaps, but would you dare to play those little games again?"
1701,
1702,STEVEN: Not until I've laid hands on you. 
1703,"DOCTOR: Oh, it's no use, Steven. Leave him. "
1704,DODO: Are you all right? 
1705,STEVEN: I couldn't touch him. 
1706,DOCTOR: He's using his mind to turn your strength against yourself.
1707,"Now, go back into the Tardis. I will deal with him. "
1708,(Dodo and Steven leave.) 
1709,"TOYMAKER: Doctor, I offer you power. Power to corrupt, to destroy."
1710,Think of the exhilaration of that power. Serve me and live. 
1711,"DOCTOR: Never! Never, my friend. You have been defeated. "
1712,(The Doctor goes into the Tardis.) 
1713,"TOYMAKER: We will see, old man. The game is not yet over. We shall see."
1714,
1715,"(The Toymaker sits down next to the trilogic board, and the Doctor"
1716,comes out of the Tardis.) 
1717,DOCTOR: What have you done? Stop meddling with my ship! 
1718,"TOYMAKER: It isn't what I have done, but what you have not done. You"
1719,must finish the game. You cannot leave here until you have. 
1720,"DOCTOR: Your infantile behaviour is beyond a joke. No. Of course, I"
1721,mustn't. You very nearly caught me then. 
1722,"TOYMAKER: Make your last move, Doctor. Make your move. "
1723,"DOCTOR: But if I do, this place vanishes. "
1724,TOYMAKER: And then you have won completely. 
1725,"DOCTOR: And if this place vanishes, then the Tardis and the rest of us,"
1726,will vanish also. 
1727,"TOYMAKER: Correct. That is the price of success. Make your last move,"
1728,Doctor. Make your last move.
1729,
1730,[Tardis]
1731,
1732,STEVEN: What can be keeping him? 
1733,DODO: Something the Toymaker has done to the Tardis. The Doctor has to
1734,persuade the Toymaker to let us go. 
1735,"STEVEN: We won his games, we have the right to go. The Toymaker said"
1736,that. 
1737,"DODO: Now I'm here, I don't mind. I know I'm safe. "
1738,"STEVEN: I think I'm going to take. Oh, here he is. "
1739,(The Doctor enters.) 
1740,"DOCTOR: Close the doors, my boy. "
1741,STEVEN: So what's happened? 
1742,DOCTOR: It's no use. 
1743,STEVEN: What's he done? 
1744,"DOCTOR: If we destroy the Toymaker, we destroy this world. "
1745,"STEVEN: Well, is that bad? "
1746,"DODO: Surely, that's a good thing. This is really a very sad place. "
1747,"DOCTOR: I don't think neither of you understand. As the games are over,"
1748,"and won by us, everything outside the Tardis disappears. And if we are"
1749,"there, we disappear also. "
1750,DODO: But we have won and it hasn't happened yet. 
1751,"DOCTOR: But it will, my dear, the moment I go out there and make the"
1752,final move of the trilogic game. 
1753,STEVEN: Why doesn't he just let us go? He can't want to be destroyed. 
1754,"DOCTOR: Oh, he won't be. "
1755,"DODO: But if everything disappears, why not him? "
1756,"DOCTOR: If the Toymaker loses the game, his world will vanish, but he"
1757,has the power to build a new one. 
1758,DODO: How? 
1759,DOCTOR: The Toymaker is immortal. He's lasted for thousands of years.
1760,"Very occasionally, of course, he loses a game, and then he has to pay"
1761,the price. 
1762,STEVEN: And that price is the loss of his world? 
1763,"DOCTOR: Yes, but he himself is not destroyed. He goes on forever. "
1764,STEVEN: So we can't leave. 
1765,DOCTOR: There must be a way. 
1766,(The Doctor turns on the scanner.) 
1767,[Game room]
1768,
1769,DOCTOR : Will you leave my ship alone? Do you
1770,hear me? Will you leave my ship alone? 
1771,"TOYMAKER: Let me have it, Doctor. It will be such an amusing toy. "
1772,DOCTOR : Let me have the trilogic game in here. 
1773,"TOYMAKER: Of course not. Be reasonable, Doctor. If I allow you to make"
1774,"the last move in there, then you can preset your controls and"
1775,dematerialise at the same moment that my world vanishes. Then you will
1776,escape. 
1777,DOCTOR : It will make no difference to you. You can build a new
1778,world. 
1779,TOYMAKER: Of course. And I look forward to that. I'm bored with this
1780,"one. But I'm a bad loser, Doctor. I always destroy the destroyer. "
1781,[Tardis]
1782,
1783,DOCTOR: I will not come out and make that final
1784,move. 
1785,TOYMAKER [on scanner]: Then you must stay there forever. 
1786,"STEVEN: Doctor, let me go out and make that move for you. "
1787,"DOCTOR: Oh, nonsense, dear boy. You don't want to disappear. "
1788,STEVEN: At least you and Dodo would get away. 
1789,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, that's very noble and kind of you, but I absolutely"
1790,forbid it. You've done quite enough in getting the Tardis back. 
1791,"STEVEN: All right, but something's got to be done. We can't just stand"
1792,here and talk our way out of this. 
1793,DOCTOR: We can! That's just it. That's just what we can do. Listen to
1794,me. I will make that final move.
1795,
1796,[Game room]
1797,
1798,"TOYMAKER: How sensible of you, Doctor. "
1799,DOCTOR : Go back to the trilogic game. Are you ready? 
1800,"TOYMAKER: Whenever you are, Doctor. "
1801,[Tardis]
1802,
1803,DOCTOR: Very well. (whispers) Preset for
1804,"dematerialisation. (loud) Go to move 1,023! (nothing, so he imitates"
1805,"the Toymaker's voice) Go from move 1,023! Master switch! "
1806,(The Tardis dematerialises as piece number 1 moves from B to the top of
1807,the pyramid on C and the planet explodes.) 
1808,DODO: You did it! You did it! We won! 
1809,"STEVEN: Doctor, but how was it done? "
1810,"DOCTOR: My dear boy, it was your very idea. Your very idea. Don't you"
1811,"see? When the Toymaker wanted to move the pieces, he had to command"
1812,them in a certain tone of voice to make them move at all. 
1813,DODO: But you had to do it twice. 
1814,"DOCTOR: Yes, but in the first place, you see, I couldn't, because I"
1815,used my own voice. 
1816,DODO: I don't see. 
1817,STEVEN: I do. The Toymaker wasn't playing. 
1818,"DOCTOR: Exactly, dear boy, exactly. Therefore, I had to imitate the"
1819,"Toymaker's voice to make them obey me, and they did. "
1820,"DODO: We'll never see him again, will we, Doctor? "
1821,"DOCTOR: Oh, my dear, don't talk too soon. The mind is indestructible."
1822,So is the Toymaker. 
1823,"STEVEN: What, you mean he can never be destroyed? "
1824,DODO: But you defeated him. 
1825,"DOCTOR: Yes, just at this moment, but there will be other meetings in"
1826,an other time. 
1827,DODO: Then your battle with him will never end. 
1828,"DOCTOR: Yes, you're quite right, my dear, but anyway, let us cheer up."
1829,After all we did win the games. 
1830,"DODO: Hey, let's celebrate with these. "
1831,DOCTOR: With what? 
1832,"DODO: Here, these. "
1833,DOCTOR: What are those? 
1834,DODO: They're Cyril's sweets. He gave them to me just before the race
1835,game. 
1836,"STEVEN: Oh, throw them away, Dodo. I only told you to take them so that"
1837,we wouldn't waste anymore time. 
1838,"DODO: Oh, all right. "
1839,DOCTOR: This is really interesting. The last present from the Toymaker.
1840,I wonder. 
1841,"(The Doctor bites into the hard sweet, and cries out in pain.) "
1842,"DODO: Doctor, what's wrong?"
