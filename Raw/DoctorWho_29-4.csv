20,
21,(The Laurenzi presents - New York Revue. The music
22,tells me we're in the 1920's. A showgirl in skimpy red costume with
23,wings and feathers is hurrying along.) 
24,MYRNA: Two minutes to curtain up! Come on! 
25,STAGE MANAGER : Two minutes to curtain up! 
26,MYRNA: Where's Tallulah? 
27,LOIS: Where do you think? 
28,(She knocks on the star's dressing room door.) 
29,"LOIS: Hey, Tallulah, leave him alone! "
30,(The chorus head for the stage and a clown down looks sadly at his
31,three juggling balls.)
32,
33,[Tallulah's dressing room]
34,
35,(Tallulah's costume is white with wings and a halo.
36,She is kissing her boyfriend.) 
37,"TALLULAH: It's nearly showtime, Laszlo. I got to go. "
38,"LASZLO: Just promise me you'll come on Sunday, okay? My mother will"
39,kill me if she doesn't get to meet you. 
40,TALLULAH: What if she doesn't like me? 
41,"LASZLO: Tallulah, she'll love you just as much as I do. "
42,"TALLULAH: Oh, you say the sweetest things. "
43,"LASZLO: It's true. Now, promise me, Sunday you'll come. "
44,TALLULAH: I promise. Cross my heart. 
45,"LASZLO: Oh, here. Take this, sweetheart. "
46,(He gives her a white rose.) 
47,LASZLO: Wear it on stage and think of me. 
48,LOIS : Tallulah! 
49,TALLULAH: I'm coming! Quit yelling! How do I look? 
50,LASZLO: Like an angel. 
51,(Tallulah blows one last kiss before heading up the stairs to the
52,"stage, where the audience are already whistling and cheering.) "
53,"TALLULAH: Wish me luck, Lazlo! "
54,"LASZLO: Break a leg, sweetheart. "
55,(Something runs past the open doorway.) 
56,LASZLO: Tallulah? 
57,[Backstage]
58,
59,(There is a strange grunting sound. Laszlo sees
60,"something run across a corridor out of the corner of his eye, and"
61,follows it.) 
62,LASZLO: Who's there? 
63,[Props room]
64,
65,LASZLO: Hello? Hello? Who's there? Who are you? 
66,(He strikes a match from a book and comes face to face with a wooden
67,pirate. Then a pig in a boiler suit runs at him on its hind legs.)
68,
69,[Bedloe's Island]
70,
71,(The Tardis materialises in one of the corners of
72,an eleven pointed Army base exterior wall.) 
73,MARTHA: Where are we? 
74,"DOCTOR: Ah, smell that Atlantic breeze. Nice and cold. Lovely. Martha,"
75,have you met my friend? 
76,(She turns around and looks up. Background music is Rhapsody in Blue.) 
77,"MARTHA: Is that? Oh, my God. That's the Statue of Liberty. "
78,"DOCTOR: Gateway to the New World. Give me you tired, your poor, your"
79,huddled masses yearning to breath free. 
80,MARTHA: That's so brilliant. I've always wanted to go to New York. I
81,"mean the real New York, not the new, new, new, new, new one. "
82,"DOCTOR: Well, there's the genuine article. So good, they named it"
83,"twice. Mind you, it was New Amsterdam originally. Harder to say twice."
84,"Now wonder it didn't catch on. New Amsterdam, New Amsterdam. "
85,"MARTHA: I wonder what year it is, because look, the Empire State"
86,Building's not even finished yet. 
87,"DOCTOR: Work in progress. Still got a couple floors to go, and if I"
88,"know my history, that makes the date somewhere around "
89,(Martha picks up a copy of the New York Record which is lying on a
90,bench.) 
91,MARTHA: November first 1930. 
92,DOCTOR: You're getting good at this. 
93,"MARTHA: Eighty years ago. It's funny, because you see all those old"
94,"newsreels all in black and white like it's so far away, but here we"
95,"are. It's real. It's now. Come on then, you. Where do you want to go"
96,first? 
97,DOCTOR: I think our detour just got longer. 
98,MARTHA: (reads) Hooverville Mystery Deepens. What's Hooverville?
99,
100,[Central Park]
101,
102,(Music changes to Putting on the Ritz.) 
103,"DOCTOR: Herbert Hoover, thirty first President of the USA, came to"
104,"power a year ago. Up till then New York was a boom town, the Roaring"
105,"Twenties, and then. "
106,"MARTHA: The Wall Street Crash, yeah? When was that, 1929? "
107,DOCTOR: Yeah. Whole economy wiped out overnight. Thousands of people
108,"unemployed. All of a sudden, the huddled masses doubled in number with"
109,"nowhere to go. So, they ended up here in Central Park. "
110,"MARTHA: What, they actually live in the park? In the middle of the"
111,city?
112,
113,[Hooverville]
114,
115,(A shanty town overlooked by Manhattan
116,skyscrapers.) 
117,DOCTOR: Ordinary people lost their jobs. Couldn't pay the rent and they
118,lost everything. There are places like this all over America. No one's
119,helping them. You only come to Hooverville when there's nowhere else to
120,go. 
121,BLACK MAN: You thieving lowlife! 
122,(A fight breaks out.) 
123,BLACK MAN: (unintelligible) for a single loaf! 
124,WHITE MAN: I didn't touch it! 
125,BLACK MAN: Somebody stole it.! 
126,(A black man comes out of a tent.) 
127,SOLOMON: Cut that out! Cut that out right now! 
128,(He breaks up the fight.) 
129,BLACK MAN: He stole my bread! 
130,SOLOMON: That's enough! Did you take it? 
131,WHITE MAN: I don't know what happened. He just went crazy. 
132,"SOLOMON: That's enough! Now, think real careful before you lie to me. "
133,"WHITE MAN: I'm starving, Solomon. "
134,"(Soloman holds out his hand, and the white man takes the bread out from"
135,inside his coat.) 
136,SOLOMON: We all starving. We all got families somewhere. 
137,(He does the judgment of Soloman and gives each man half of the loaf.) 
138,SOLOMAN: No stealing and no fighting. You know the rules. Thirteen
139,years ago I fought in the Great War. A lot of us did. And the only
140,reason we got through was because we stuck together. No matter how bad
141,"things get, we still act like human beings. It's all we got. "
142,(The two fighters walk away.) 
143,DOCTOR: Come on. (to Solomon) I suppose that makes you the boss around
144,here. 
145,"SOLOMON: And, er, who might you be? "
146,MARTHA: He's the Doctor. I'm Martha. 
147,"SOLOMON: A doctor. Huh. Well, we got stockbrokers, we got a lawyer, but"
148,you're the first doctor. Neighbourhood gets classier by the day. 
149,MARTHA: How many people live here? 
150,"SOLOMON: At any one time, hundreds. No place else to go. But I will say"
151,"this about Hooverville. We are a truly equal society. Black, white, all"
152,"the same. All starving. So you're welcome, both of you. But tell me."
153,"Doctor, you're a man of learning, right? Explain this to me. That"
154,there's going to be the tallest building in the world. How come they
155,"can do that, when we got people starving in the heart of Manhattan?"
156,
157,[Empire State Building]
158,
159,"(Up at the top, where building work is still going"
160,"on, men are standing on the scaffolding and pulling up buckets.) "
161,"WORKMAN: Right, no more! "
162,WORKMAN 2: Hoist! 
163,[Works office]
164,
165,"(Inside the structure, a man is sitting at a desk"
166,looking at blueprints while the foreman paces.) 
167,"FOREMAN: I'm telling you, the men won't stand for it. I mean, are you"
168,out of your mind? I got five hundred men working seven days a week.
169,"They're flat out, and you want us to go faster? "
170,"DIAGORAS: The new masters demand it, "
171,FOREMAN: But we're on schedule. What's the problem? Another month and
172,we'll be done. 
173,DIAGORAS: The mast on this building needs extra work completed by
174,tonight. 
175,FOREMAN: Tonight? No way. It's impossible. 
176,DIAGORAS: That's an order. 
177,"FOREMAN: Yeah? Well, one word from me and every man on this site stops"
178,working. So go on. Tell your masters that. 
179,"DIAGORAS: If that's your attitude, I think that you should tell them"
180,yourself. 
181,"FOREMAN: Yeah? Well, I ain't afraid of no man in a suit. "
182,(Diagoras summons the lift.) 
183,"FOREMAN: These er, these new bosses? What's their names? "
184,DIAGORAS: I think you could say they're from out of town. 
185,FOREMAN: Italians? 
186,DIAGORAS: A bit further than that. 
187,FOREMAN: How much further? 
188,DIAGORAS: Beyond your imagination. 
189,"FOREMAN: What's that supposed to mean? Who are they? Mister Diagoras,"
190,who're we working for? 
191,(The lift comes up from the bottom to floor 100.) 
192,DIAGORAS: Behold your masters. 
193,(The lift doors open to reveal one of the Cult of Skaro Dalek number 3
194,with by two pigmen.) 
195,FOREMAN: What the hell? 
196,DALEK 3: I have been summoned. Explain. Explain. 
197,FOREMAN: It can talk. How does it talk? And what the hell are they? You
198,got to be kidding me. 
199,"DIAGORAS: I'm sorry, my lord, but this man is refusing to complete the"
200,work. 
201,DALEK 3: Then we must replace him. 
202,FOREMAN: Is anybody going to tell me what the hell is happening here? 
203,DALEK 3: Use him. Take him for the Final Experiment. 
204,(The pigmen take hold of the foreman and bundle him into the lift.) 
205,"FOREMAN: Hey, what's going on? Let go! Let go of me! Get off me, you"
206,"freaks! Mister Diagoras, will you tell"
207,them? 
208,(The lift goes back down.) 
209,DALEK 3: The Empire State Building must be completed in time. 
210,DIAGORAS: It will be. Trust me. Labour is cheap and that man can be
211,replaced. 
212,DALEK 3: The plan must not fail. We calculate the gamma strike has
213,accelerated. We need more bodies immediately. 
214,"DIAGORAS: Yes, Master."
215,
216,[Hooverville]
217,
218,"DOCTOR: So, men are going missing. Is this true? "
219,SOLOMON: It's true all right. 
220,[Solomon's tent]
221,
222,DOCTOR: But what does missing mean? Men must come
223,and go here all the time. It's not like anyone's keeping a register. 
224,SOLOMON: Come on in. This is different. 
225,MARTHA: In what way? 
226,"SOLOMON: Someone takes them, at night. We hear something, someone calls"
227,"out for help. By the time we get there, they're gone like they vanished"
228,into thin air. 
229,DOCTOR: And you're sure someone's taking them? 
230,"SOLOMON: Doctor, when you got next to nothing, you hold on to the"
231,"little you got. Your knife, blanket, you take it with you. You don't"
232,"leave bread uneaten, fire still burning. "
233,MARTHA: Have you been to the police? 
234,"SOLOMON: Yeah, we tried that. Another deadbeat goes missing, big deal. "
235,"DOCTOR: So the question is, who's taking them and what for? "
236,FRANK : Solomon! 
237,"FRANK: Solomon, Mister Diagoras is here. "
238,[Hooverville] 
239,DIAGORAS: I need men. Volunteers. I've got a little
240,work for you and you sure look like you can use the money. 
241,FRANK: Yeah. What is the money? 
242,DIAGORAS: A dollar a day. 
243,SOLOMON: What's the work? 
244,DIAGORAS: A little trip down the sewers. Got a tunnel collapsed needs
245,clearing and fixing. Any takers? 
246,SOLOMON: A dollar a day? That's slave wage. And men don't always come
247,"back up, do they. "
248,DIAGORAS: Accidents happen. 
249,DOCTOR: What do you mean? What sort of accidents? 
250,DIAGORAS: You don't need the work? That's fine. Anybody else? 
251,(The Doctor raises his hand.) 
252,DIAGORAS: Enough with the questions. 
253,"DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no. I'm volunteering. I'll go. "
254,(Martha raises her hand.) 
255,MARTHA: I'll kill you for this. 
256,DIAGORAS: Anybody else? 
257,(Frank and Solomon.)
258,
259,[Sewers]
260,
261,DIAGORAS: Turn left. Go about a half a mile. Follow
262,"tunnel two seven three. Fall's right ahead of you, you can't miss it. "
263,FRANK: And when do we get our dollar? 
264,DIAGORAS: When you come back up. 
265,DOCTOR: And if we don't come back up? 
266,DIAGORAS: Then I got no one to pay. 
267,"SOLOMON: Don't worry, we'll be back. "
268,MARTHA: Let's hope so. 
269,"(The Doctor stares into Diagoras' eyes for a few moments, then follows"
270,the others.) 
271,FRANK: We just got to stick together. It's easy to get lost. It's like
272,a huge rabbit warren. You could hide an army down here. 
273,"MARTHA: So what about you, Frank? You're not from around these parts,"
274,are you? 
275,"FRANK: Oh, you could talk. No, I'm Tennessee born and bred. "
276,MARTHA: So how come you're here? 
277,"FRANK: Oh, my daddy died. Mama couldn't afford to feed us all. So, I'm"
278,"the oldest, up to me to feed myself. So I put on my coat, hitched up"
279,"here on the railroads. There's a whole lot of runaways in the camp,"
280,"younger than me, from all over. Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas. Solomon"
281,"keeps a lookout for us. So, what about you? You're a long way from"
282,home. 
283,"MARTHA: Yeah, I'm just a hitcher too. "
284,"FRANK: You stick with me, you'll be all right. "
285,"DOCTOR: So this Diagoras bloke, who is he then? "
286,"SOLOMON: A couple of months ago, he was just another foreman. Now, it"
287,seems like he's running most of Manhattan. 
288,DOCTOR: How'd he manage that then? 
289,SOLOMON: These are strange times. A man can go from being King of the
290,Hill to the lowest of the low overnight. It's just for some folks it
291,works the other way round. 
292,DOCTOR: Whoa! 
293,(A luminous green jellyfish is lying on the ground in front of them.) 
294,"MARTHA: Is it radioactive or something? It's gone off, whatever it is."
295,And you've got to pick it up. 
296,DOCTOR: Shine your torch through it. Composite organic matter. Martha?
297,Medical opinion? 
298,MARTHA: It's not human. I know that. 
299,"DOCTOR: No, it's not. And I'll tell you something else. We must be at"
300,"least half a mile in. I don't see any sign of a collapse, do you? So"
301,why did Mister Diagoras send up down here? 
302,MARTHA: Where are we now? What's above us? 
303,"DOCTOR: Well, we're right underneath Manhattan."
304,
305,[Works office]
306,
307,"DIAGORAS: And here, the crowning glory of the"
308,"Empire State Building, the mast itself. One thousand four hundred and"
309,seventy two feet above New York. 
310,"FOREMAN 2: It's a beautiful thing, sir, and every single one of us is"
311,"proud of it. My wife says it's like a, like a spire reaching into"
312,Heaven. 
313,DIAGORAS: Except the Gates of Heaven need a little decoration. These
314,"plates have got to be fixed to the mast, right to the base itself. "
315,(Three plates with a familiar row of four domes on them.) 
316,FOREMAN 2: That's okay. It's not too bad. Shouldn't take too long. 
317,DIAGORAS: But the work has got to be finished tonight. 
318,(The five men protest.) 
319,"FOREMAN 2: What, are you trying to kill us? We're flat out up here!"
320,Come on. 
321,DIAGORAS: Don't argue with me! 
322,"FOREMAN 2: But sir, men can't work up there at night. It's freezing."
323,"Your hands go numb. You lose your grip, you fall. "
324,DIAGORAS: You don't get it. If you won't work I can replace you like
325,that! Now take those panels and get going. 
326,(A man picks up a panel. It is very heavy.) 
327,MAN: What sort of metal is this anyway? 
328,"DIAGORAS: Don't ask questions, just go. "
329,(They take the panels leave.) 
330,"DIAGORAS: And I don't care how cold it is, how tired you are. Just get"
331,out there and finish the job! 
332,"(A few moments later, a Dalek enters from the lift.) "
333,DALEK 3: The conductor must be complete for our plan to succeed. 
334,"DIAGORAS: Unemployment is such an incentive. It'll get done, don't"
335,worry. 
336,DALEK 3: Daleks have no concept of worry. 
337,"DIAGORAS: Yeah? Well, lucky you. "
338,DALEK 3: This day is ending. Humankind is weak. You shelter from the
339,"dark. And yet, you have built all this. "
340,DIAGORAS: That's progress. You got to move with the times or you get
341,left behind. 
342,"DALEK 3: My planet is gone, destroyed in a great war, yet versions of"
343,this city stand throughout history. The human race always continues. 
344,"DIAGORAS: We've had wars. I've been a soldier myself, and I swore then"
345,"I'd survive, no matter what. "
346,DALEK 3: You have rare ambition. 
347,"DIAGORAS: I want to run this city, whatever it takes, by any means"
348,necessary. 
349,DALEK 3: You think like a Dalek. 
350,DIAGORAS: I'll take that as a compliment.
351,
352,[Dalek laboratory]
353,
354,(The other two gold Daleks join the Black Dalek to
355,see what number 3 is looking at.) 
356,DALEK SEC: This human is our best option. Bring him to me.
357,
358,[Works office]
359,
360,DALEK 3: Your loyalty will be rewarded. Come with
361,me.
362,
363,[Dalek laboratory]
364,
365,DALEK SEC: Prepare the laboratory. The Final
366,Experiment will begin. 
367,DALEKS: We obey.
368,
369,[Lift]
370,
371,(The doors close without anyone touching the
372,controls.) 
373,DIAGORAS: Where are we going? 
374,DALEK: You have been summoned by our leader. 
375,"DIAGORAS: Oh, and about time too. "
376,[Dalek laboratory]
377,
378,(Diagoras leaves the lift and puts on a pair of
379,gloves he has in his pocket. He walks forward slowly and a crowd of
380,pigmen gather.) 
381,DALEK 1: I bring you the human. 
382,DIAGORAS: I take it you're in charge? 
383,"DALEK SEC: Correct. I am Dalek Sec, leader of the Cult of Skaro. "
384,"DIAGORAS: Then, my Lord Sec, I am honoured to meet you. Ever since you"
385,"first made contact with me, transmitting your thoughts into the corners"
386,"of my mind, tempting me with such images, such ideas. Oh, sir, I'd"
387,always dreamt that the 
388,DALEK SEC: Cease talking. 
389,DIAGORAS: I just want to let you know how grateful I am 
390,"DALEK SEC: I said cease. Slaves, secure the human. "
391,DIAGORAS: But you don't need to do that. I'm on your side. I'm working
392,with you. I'm your partner. I'm your friend. 
393,(Diagoras struggles against the pigmen's grasp.)
394,
395,[Sewers]
396,
397,(By a handy manhole cover that is shedding some
398,light.) 
399,"SOLOMON: We're way beyond half a mile. There's no collapse, nothing. "
400,"MARTHA: That Diagoras bloke, was he lying? "
401,DOCTOR: Looks like it. 
402,FRANK: So why'd he want people to come down here? 
403,"DOCTOR: Solomon, I think it's time you took these two back. I'll be"
404,much quicker on my own. 
405,(Pig squeals echo around them.) 
406,SOLOMON: What the hell was that? 
407,FRANK: Hello? 
408,MARTHA: Shush. 
409,SOLOMON: Frank. 
410,FRANK: What if it's one of the folk gone missing? You'd be scared and
411,half mad down here on your own. 
412,DOCTOR: Do you think they're still alive? 
413,"FRANK: Heck, we ain't seen no bodies down here. Maybe they just got"
414,lost. 
415,(More squeals.) 
416,SOLOMON: I know I never heard nobody make a sound like that. 
417,FRANK: Where's it coming from? Sounds like there's more than one of
418,them. 
419,DOCTOR: This way. 
420,"SOLOMON: No, that way. "
421,(Solomon's torch lights up a figure crouched in a corner.) 
422,MARTHA: Doctor? 
423,SOLOMON: Who are you? 
424,FRANK: Are you lost? Can you understand me? I've been thinking about
425,folk lost down 
426,"DOCTOR: It's all right, Frank. Just stay back. Let me have a look. He's"
427,"got a point, though, my mate Frank. I'd hate to be stuck down here on"
428,my own. We know the way out. Daylight. If you come with us 
429,(Then he sees that the man is a pig.) 
430,"DOCTOR: Oh, but what are you? "
431,"SOLOMON: Is that, er, some kind of carnival mask? "
432,"DOCTOR: No, it's real. I'm sorry. Now listen to me. I promise I can"
433,help. Who did this to you? 
434,MARTHA: Doctor? I think you'd better get back here. 
435,(More pigmen have entered the tunnel.) 
436,MARTHA: Doctor! 
437,"DOCTOR: Actually, good point. "
438,(He returns to the group.) 
439,MARTHA: They're following you. 
440,"DOCTOR: Yeah, I noticed that, thanks. Well then, Martha, Frank,"
441,Solomon. 
442,MARTHA: What? 
443,"DOCTOR: Eh? Er, basically, run! "
444,(The pigmen chase them back to a junction.) 
445,MARTHA: Where are we going?! 
446,DOCTOR: This way! 
447,(He spots something down a side passage.) 
448,DOCTOR: It's a ladder! Come on! 
449,(The Doctor uses the sonic screwdriver to open the cover at the top.
450,Frank grabs an iron T bar to ward off the pigmen as Martha climbs up.) 
451,SOLOMON: Frank! Frank! 
452,"(Solomon climbs to safety, then Frank runs to the ladder.) "
453,"SOLOMON: C'mon, Frank! C'mon! "
454,(The pigmen grab Frank's legs. Solomon and the Doctor try to grab his

463,"to climb the ladder, and slams the lid shut.) "
464,SOLOMON: We can't go after him. 
465,DOCTOR: We've got to go back down. We can't just leave him. 
466,"SOLOMON: No, I'm not losing anybody else. Those creatures were from"
467,"Hell. From Hell itself! If we go after them, they'll take us all!"
468,There's nothing we can do. I'm sorry. 
469,(Tallulah steps out from behind a rack and points a revolver at them.)

473,
474,[Tallulah's dressing room]
475,
476,(Tallulah still has the revolver.) 
477,TALLULAH: Laszlo's my boyfriend. Or was my boyfriend until he
478,"disappeared two weeks ago. No letter, no goodbye, no nothing. And I'm"
479,"not stupid. I know some guys are just pigs but not my Laszlo. I mean,"
480,what kind of guy asks you to meet his mother before he vamooses? 
481,"DOCTOR: Yeah. It might, might just help if you put that down. "
482,"TALLULAH: Huh? Oh, sure. Oh, come on. It's not real. It's just a prop."
483,It was either that or a spear. 
484,MARTHA: What do you think happened to Lazlo? 
485,"TALLULAH: I wish I knew. One minute he's there, the next, zip."
486,Vanished. 
487,"DOCTOR: Listen, ah�what's your name? "
488,TALLULAH: Tallulah. 
489,DOCTOR: Tallulah. 
490,TALLULAH: Three Ls and an H. 
491,"DOCTOR: Right. We can try to find Laszlo, but he's not the only one."
492,There are people disappearing every night. 
493,SOLOMON: And there are creatures. Such creatures. 
494,"TALLULAH: What do you mean, creatures? "
495,"DOCTOR: Look, listen, just trust me. Everyone is in danger. I need to"
496,find out exactly what this is. 
497,(The jellyfish thing.) 
498,DOCTOR: Because then I'll know exactly what we're fighting.

504,gizmo. Solomon brings a small Art Nouveau radio.) 
505,SOLOMON: How about this? I found it backstage. 
506,DOCTOR: Perfect. It's the capacitors I need. I'm just rigging up a
507,crude little DNA scan for this beastie. If I can get a chromosomal
508,"reading, I can find out where it's from. "
509,"SOLOMON: How about you, Doctor? Where are you from? I've been all over."
510,I never heard anybody talk like you. Just exactly who are you? 
511,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm just sort of passing by. "
512,"SOLOMON: I'm not a fool, Doctor. "
513,DOCTOR: No. Sorry. 
514,(Solomon goes to the NYC sewer entrance.) 
515,"SOLOMON: I was so scared, Doctor. I let them take Frank because I was"
516,just so scared. I got to get back to Hooverville. With these creatures
517,"on the loose, we got to protect ourselves. Ain't no one else"
518,going to help us.

524,(Tallulah is getting ready for her next show.) 
525,TALLULAH: Laszlo. He'd wait for me after the show. Walk me home like I
526,"was a lady. He'd leave a flower for me on my dressing table. Every day,"
527,just a single rose bud. 
528,MARTHA: Haven't you reported him missing? 
529,TALLULAH: Sure. He's just a stagehand. Who cares? The management
530,certainly don't. 
531,MARTHA: Can't you kick up a fuss or something? 
532,"TALLULAH: Okay, so then they fire me. "
533,MARTHA: But they'd listen to you. You're one of the stars. 
534,"TALLULAH: Oh, honey, I got one song in a back street revue and that's"
535,only because Heidi Chicane broke her ankle. Which had nothing to do
536,with me whatever anybody says. I can't afford to make a fuss. If I
537,"don't make this month's rent, then before you know it, I'm in"

539,"MARTHA: Okay, I get it. "
540,"TALLULAH: It's the Depression, sweetie. Your heart might break, but the"
541,"show goes on. Because if it stops, you starve. Every night I have to go"
542,"out there, sing, dance, keep going, hoping he's going to"
543,come back.

545,"TALLULAH: Hey, you're lucky, though. You got yourself a forward"

547,"MARTHA: Er, he's not. We're not together. "
548,"TALLULAH: Oh, sure you are. I've seen the way you look at him. It's"
549,obvious. 
550,MARTHA: Not to him. 
551,"TALLULAH: Oh, I should have realised. He's into musical theatre, huh?"
552,"What a waste. Still, you"
553,"got to live in hope. It's the only thing that's kept me going because,"
554,"well, look. On my dressing table every day still. "

590,You're not going to

599,"are supreme, why are we not victorious? The Cult of Skaro was created"
600,by the Emperor for this very purpose. To imagine new ways of survival. 
601,DALEK THAY: But we must remain pure.
