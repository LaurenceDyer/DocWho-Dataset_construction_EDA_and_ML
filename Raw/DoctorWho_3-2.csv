17,One - Temple of Secrets 
18, [Plain outside Troy]
19,
20,"(On the plain outside the ancient city of Troy, two"
21,men are fighting.) 
22,HECTOR: Achilles! 
23,"ACHILLES: Over here, stable keeper. Barbarian horse worshipper! "
24,"HECTOR: Out of breath so soon, my light-foot princeling? Your friend"
25,"Petrocolus fled me further, and made better sport! "
26,ACHILLES: Murderer! Petrocolus was a boy. 
27,"HECTOR: A boy? Well he died like a dog, whimpering after his master"
28,Achilles! How! Let me send you to him where he waits in Hades. Let me
29,throw the dog a bone or two! 
30,"(Achilles lunges at Hector, who easily parries the thrust. They circle"
31,round each other warily.) 
32,"HECTOR: What? So anxious to be gone? Well, I would not keep you for the"
33,world. 
34,"ACHILLES: Your bones would be the meatier, Trojan. Though meat a trifle"
35,"rough at that. Well, all's one. They will whiten well enough in the"
36,sun! 
37,"(Enraged, Achilles attacks again, and Hector counters every blow."
38,Hector seems to be gaining the upper hand when Achilles turns and
39,"dodges out of reach, running past and ignoring the blue police box"
40,"which has no place in the middle of a Trojan plain. Hector follows,"
41,calling after him.) 
42,"HECTOR: Run, Achilles! Run! Run a little more, before you die!"
43,
44,[Tardis]
45,
46,"VICKI: What sort of people are they, Doctor? "
47,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm not sure, my child. You'll notice they're wearing"
48,Grecian costumes. 
49,VICKI: They don't seem to have noticed us. 
50,STEVEN: That's hardly surprising in the circumstances. Why do you
51,suppose they're fighting? 
52,"DOCTOR: I haven't the remotest idea, my boy. No doubt their reasons"
53,"will be entirely adequate. Yes, I think I perhaps I'd better go and ask"
54,them where we are. 
55,"VICKI: Doctor, be careful! They look terribly fierce. "
56,"DOCTOR: Oh, what nonsense. If you take notice of them, I think they're"
57,doing more talking than they are fighting. I think I'd better go and
58,ask them where we are. 
59,"VICKI: Doctor, you can't! You know if you go out there by yourself"
60,you'll g 
61,"DOCTOR: Now you stay here, my dear, and look after that ankle. "
62,STEVEN: Wouldn't it be better if I went? 
63,"DOCTOR: Not at all, young man. You stay here and keep an eye on Vicki."
64,"Besides, I don't think your present humour is fitting for the occasion."
65,"You know, I don't think they'd appreciate your kind of sarcasm. "
66,[Plain outside Troy]
67,
68,"ACHILLES: The gods of my people, Hector, are not"
69,lightly mocked. They are terrible! And Troy itself is doomed to fall at
70,"their bidding, even as you are. You cannot stand against them. "
71,HECTOR: You pretend that old Father Zeus will descend to Earth and take
72,Troy for you. I guarantee to trim his beard for him if he dare attempt
73,it! 
74,(thunder) 
75,"ACHILLES: Beware the voice of Zeus, Hector. Beware the anger of"
76,Olympus. 
77,"HECTOR: Oh, I do not fear the thunder, you superstitious, dark-dodging"
78,"decadent! Hear me, Zeus! Accept from me the promised life of your"
79,"cringing servant Achilles! Or else, I challenge you. Descend to Earth"
80,and save him! 
81,"(Hector lunges at Achilles as the Doctor emerges from the Tardis, and"
82,"Hector falls to his knees, amazed.) "
83,HECTOR: Zeus! Forgive me. 
84,"(With Hector distracted, Achilles runs him through with his sword.) "
85,DOCTOR: Stop! You must not kick a man when he is down. You have killed
86,this poor fellow! 
87,"ACHILLES: Oh, but in your name. "
88,"DOCTOR: In my name, indeed! Get up! Get up, I tell you! This is"
89,terrible. 
90,ACHILLES: If Zeus bids me to rise. 
91,DOCTOR: What is this? What is it you take me for? 
92,ACHILLES: The Father of the Gods and ruler of the world. 
93,"DOCTOR: What! Do you really? And who might you be, may I ask? "
94,"ACHILLES: Achilles. Mightiest of warriors, greatest in battle, humblest"
95,of your servants. 
96,"DOCTOR: Well, if I may say so, you're not very humble, are you? Yes, I"
97,think I know you. Yes. And this friend of yours must be 
98,"ACHILLES: Hector, Prince of Troy. Sent to Hades for blasphemy against"
99,the gods of Greece. 
100,DOCTOR: Blasphemy? I'm sure he didn't mean it. 
101,ACHILLES: He threatened to trim your beard should you descend to Earth.
102,
103,"DOCTOR: Oh, did he now? Well, if you notice, I have no beard. "
104,"ACHILLES: If you had appeared to me in your true form, I would have"
105,been truly blinded by your radiance. It is well known that when you
106,come amongst us you adopt many different forms. 
107,"DOCTOR: Oh, do I? "
108,"ACHILLES: To Europa, you appeared as a bull. To Leda, as a swan. To me,"
109,in the guise of an old beggar. 
110,DOCTOR: I beg your pardon. I do nothing of the kind! 
111,"ACHILLES: Oh, but still your glory shines through! "
112,"DOCTOR: Oh, indeed. Indeed so. Yes, so I should hope. Yes, well, thank"
113,"you. I'm glad to meet you. Now, if you will excuse me, I must get back"
114,to my temple. Attend to his funeral. 
115,"ACHILLES: Oh, stop! You must not go. "
116,DOCTOR: Do you realise whom you are addressing? 
117,"ACHILLES: Forgive me, father Zeus, I spoke hastily. "
118,"DOCTOR: Then do not hinder me, or I will strike you with a thunderbolt!"
119,
120,"ACHILLES: I must brave even the wrath of Zeus, and implore you to"
121,remain. 
122,"DOCTOR: Well, I don't see why I should. I have many other commitments,"
123,you must understand. 
124,"ACHILLES: And one of them lies here, in the camp of Agamemnon, our"
125,"general. Oh, hear me out, I pray. For ten long years now we have laid"
126,siege to Troy and still they defy us. Come.
127,
128,[Tardis]
129,
130,"(In the Tardis, Vicki and Steven watch on the"
131,scanner as Achilles leads the Doctor to the top of a ridge.) 
132,STEVEN: Where's he off to now? It's a fine time to go looking at the
133,view. 
134,"VICKI: After all, that's why he went out there, to find out where we"
135,"are. Anyway, that man looks quite friendly now. He's probably showing"
136,him the way to the nearest town. 
137,"STEVEN: Hmm, I wonder. I think I'd better try and find some more"
138,suitable clothes.
139,
140,[Plain outside Troy]
141,
142,"ACHILLES: There they sit, secure behind their"
143,"walls, whilst we rot in their summers and starve in their crack-bone"
144,winters. 
145,(The Doctor and Achilles gaze upon the distant walled city is disturbed
146,"by the arrival of Odysseus, King of Ithaca, accompanied by a group of"
147,soldiers.) 
148,"ODYSSEUS: What's this, Achilles? So far from camp, all unprotected from"
149,a prisoner? 
150,"ACHILLES: Odysseus, this is no prisoner. "
151,DOCTOR: Certainly not. 
152,"ODYSSEUS: Not yet a prisoner? You should have called for assistance,"
153,"lad. We would not like to lose you. Come, let us escort you homewards."
154,Night might fall and find thee from thy tent. 
155,DOCTOR: I wouldn't stand for that if I were you! 
156,"ODYSSEUS: Are, but then, old fellow, you are not the Lord Achilles. He"
157,"is not the one to look for trouble, are you, boy? "
158,"ACHILLES: Have a care, pirate. Are there no Trojan throats to slit,"
159,that you dare tempt my sword? 
160,"ODYSSEUS: Throats enough, I grant you. Some half score Trojans will not"
161,whistle easy tonight. But what of you? 
162,"ACHILLES: Oh, but a trifle. I met Prince Hector. Here he lies. "
163,ODYSSEUS: Zeus! 
164,ACHILLES: Was instrumental. 
165,"ODYSSEUS: No doubt, no doubt. But what a year is this for plague. Even"
166,"the strongest might fall. Prince Hector, ha, that he should come to"
167,"this. You met him here, you say, as he lay dying? "
168,"ACHILLES: I met him, Odysseus, in single combat. "
169,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, it's true. "
170,ODYSSEUS: And raced him round the walls till down he fell exhausted. A
171,famous victory. 
172,"ACHILLES: I met him face to face, I say. Battled with him for an hour"
173,"or more, until my greater strength overcame him. "
174,"ODYSSEUS: Bravo. But tell me, Lightfoot, what of Zeus? You say he"
175,"intervened, and then? "
176,"ACHILLES: Why, there he stands, and listens to your mockery. "
177,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, I find it most interesting. "
178,"ODYSSEUS: What? This old man? This threadbare grey pate? Oh come,"
179,Achilles. 
180,"ACHILLES: Oh, forgive him, father Zeus! He is but a rough and simple"
181,sailor. 
182,"ODYSSEUS: Aye, very rough, but scarce as simple as you seem to think."
183,What have we here? 
184,(Odysseus approaches the Tardis to examine it.)
185,
186,[Tardis]
187,
188,"VICKI: Steven, he's coming in. "
189,(Steven has changed into Greek robes) 
190,"STEVEN: No, the Doctor'll stop him. I must go out and help. "
191,"VICKI: No. Don't. Just a minute. Here. Take this, and wait behind the"
192,"door, hmm?"
193,
194,[Plain outside Troy]
195,
196,"ODYSSEUS: The temple of Zeus, you say? A trifle"
197,"modest, is it not, for so powerful a god. "
198,"DOCTOR: This is my travelling temple. Being small, it's convenient. "
199,ACHILLES: You shall not enter. 
200,"DOCTOR: Certainly not! In any case, I must be off. "
201,"ACHILLES: Oh, then will you not stay with us? "
202,"DOCTOR: No. I, er "
203,"ODYSSEUS: What? You will to the Grecian camp. If indeed you be Zeus, we"
204,"have need of your assistance. Now, do not cower there, lads. Zeus is on"
205,"our side, so Agamemnon keeps insisting. Bear him up, and let us carry"
206,him in triumph to the camp. 
207,DOCTOR: I am quite capable of walking. 
208,"ACHILLES: Odysseus, I claim the honour to escort him. Let him walk to"
209,camp with me. 
210,"ODYSSEUS: You shall have honour enough, and maybe we shall have a"
211,"little of the truth. Father Zeus, we await you. We crave the pleasure"
212,"of your company at supper, and perhaps a tale or two of Aphrodite? "
213,DOCTOR: I refuse to enter into any kind of vulgar bawdry. 
214,ODYSSEUS: Then you shall tell why we find you lurking near our lines.
215,"That should prove equally entertaining. Take him, lads! And two of you"
216,"there, take up this carrion! "
217,DOCTOR: Have a care! Do not touch me! 
218,"ACHILLES: You will pay for this, Odysseus. "
219,"ODYSSEUS: Ha, will I? We shall see. This much must we do for the Lord"
220,"Achilles, lest none believe his story. "
221,"ACHILLES: You will not laugh so loud, I think, when Agamemnon hears of"
222,this.
223,
224,[Tardis]
225,
226,"(From the Tardis, Steven and Vicki watch as the"
227,"soldiers march out of sight, carrying the Doctor.) "
228,STEVEN: I am going after him. I'm sure he's been taken prisoner. 
229,"VICKI: Oh, come on. The big man was laughing. "
230,STEVEN: It didn't look as though the Doctor made a joke. 
231,"VICKI: Anyway, we don't even know where we are. "
232,"STEVEN: Well, the Doctor said they were Greeks. We're probably in"
233,Greece. 
234,"VICKI: Oh, but that would be wonderful, wouldn't it? We might meet the"
235,Heroes. We might 
236,"STEVEN: Those men who carried off the Doctor wouldn't be heroes, or"
237,anything like them. That's why I've got to go and get him. 
238,"VICKI: Well, I'm coming with you. "
239,STEVEN: And how far do you think you can get on that ankle? 
240,VICKI: It's not so bad now. I'll manage. 
241,"STEVEN: No. You stay here. Rest your ankle, watch the scanners. You'll"
242,"be perfectly safe. When you see the Doctor and me coming, open the"
243,doors. But not otherwise. 
244,"VICKI: But Steven, we mustn't "
245,STEVEN: No! I haven't got time to argue. I want to get to the Doctor
246,before they cut his head off. Now stay here. 
247,"VICKI: Goodbye. I hope you find the Doctor, that's all."
248,
249,[Agamemnon's tent]
250,
251,(The Greek encampment is a short distance from the
252,"walls of Troy. Inside the largest tent in the camp, the army's general,"
253,"Agamemnon, is feasting with his brother, Menelaus.) "
254,"AGAMEMNON: Now you drink too much, Menelaus. I've told you about it"
255,before. Why can't you learn to behave like a king instead of a
256,dropsical old camp follower? Have a little dignity. Try to remember
257,"that you're my brother, can't you? "
258,"MENELAUS: One of the reasons I drink, Agamemnon, is to forget that I am"
259,your brother. Another is this ridiculous Trojan expedition. We've been
260,"here for ten years! I want to go home. Besides, I'm not getting any"
261,younger. 
262,"AGAMEMNON: You won't get any older if you talk to me like that, brother"
263,"or no brother. What's the matter with you, man? Don't you want to get"
264,Helen back? Don't you don't you want to see your wife again? 
265,"MENELAUS: Quite frankly, no. If you must know, I was heartily glad to"
266,see the back of her. 
267,AGAMEMNON: You mustn't talk like that in front of these. 
268,MENELAUS: It wasn't the first time she'd allowed herself to be
269,abducted. I can't keep on going off to the ends of the Earth to get her
270,back. It makes me a laughing stock. 
271,AGAMEMNON: Now you knew perfectly well what she was like before you
272,"married her. Besides, this is a question of honour, to get her back."
273,"Family honour, don't you understand? "
274,"MENELAUS: Not to mention the trade routes through the Bosphorus, of"
275,course. 
276,AGAMEMNON: What have they got to do with it? 
277,"MENELAUS: It isn't enough for you that you control the Achaean League,"
278,"is it? Now you want to take over Asia Minor as well, only King Priam of"
279,Troy stands in your way. 
280,AGAMEMNON: May I remind you that these ambitions would have been served
281,"just as well if you had killed Paris in single combat, as you were"
282,expected to? 
283,"MENELAUS: Yes. But, I "
284,AGAMEMNON: And don't interrupt. 
285,MENELAUS: Oh. 
286,AGAMEMNON: Priam would have been quite prepared to let this contest
287,settle the issue between us. 
288,MENELAUS: Yes. But 
289,AGAMEMNON: Don't blame me because you've landed us into a full scale
290,war. 
291,"MENELAUS: Yes, but I did challenge Paris, if you remember, ten years"
292,ago. Fellow wouldn't accept. 
293,AGAMEMNON: He's just about as cowardly as you are. 
294,"MENELAUS: For the last time, I am not a coward. "
295,"AGAMEMNON: Well in that case, why don't you challenge someone else? "
296,MENELAUS: Anyone. 
297,AGAMEMNON: Challenge Hector. 
298,"MENELAUS: Hector? Hector? Are you mad? Why, that'd be suicide. "
299,"AGAMEMNON: Well, you don't know until you've tried it, do you? You"
300,"know, I think that's a very good idea of yours. "
301,"MENELAUS: Oh. So you want to see me killed, is that it? Is nothing"
302,sacred to you? 
303,AGAMEMNON: A brother's honour. I hold that more sacred than anything
304,"else. That's why I shall issue the challenge in the morning, on your"
305,behalf. 
306,MENELAUS: On my behalf? 
307,ACHILLES: My king. Hector is dead. 
308,AGAMEMNON: What? How did this happen? 
309,ACHILLES: This very day. I slew him after an hour or more of single
310,combat. 
311,"AGAMEMNON: Oh, you did. Oh dear. There's another good idea wasted. "
312,"ACHILLES: And what do you mean, wasted? Here have I been, fight "
313,"AGAMEMNON: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,"
314,"yes, yes. It's only that Menelaus was just about to challenge him. "
315,MENELAUS: Now don't think I'm not pleased with what you've done. I am. 
316,AGAMEMNON: Sit down. Tell us all about it. 
317,"ACHILLES: But, I have other more important news, and there isn't much"
318,time. 
319,"MENELAUS: What, more important than the death of Hector? "
320,"ACHILLES: At the height of my battle with Hector, there came a sudden"
321,"lightning flash, and Zeus appeared before me. "
322,MENELAUS: Zeus! Oh. Eh? 
323,"AGAMEMNON: It's all right, he's been listening to too much propaganda,"
324,"haven't you, Achilles? You mustn't take so much notice of that. "
325,"ACHILLES: Look, I tell you it's true. He appeared to me from nowhere in"
326,the shape of a little old man. 
327,"AGAMEMNON: Oh! Where is he now, this little old Zeus? "
328,ACHILLES: He was about to accompany me here when Odysseus and his men
329,arrived. They took him prisoner. 
330,AGAMEMNON: They what? 
331,ACHILLES: Odysseus mocked him then they seized him and are bringing him
332,to camp. I ran ahead to warn you. 
333,AGAMEMNON: You did well. Perdition take Odysseus. You can't be too
334,careful in matters like this. He may in fact be Zeus. Guard! Go find
335,the Lord Odysseus. Command his presence here.
336,"(A while later, Odysseus, having received the command, storms into"
337,Agamemnon's tent.) 
338,"ODYSSEUS: Who dares command Odysseus? Well, Agamemnon, is it you? Well,"
339,we will not quarrel when we have a guest of such importance. Here's
340,"this old man, claims to be our father Zeus. "
341,(The Doctor is shoved into the tent.) 
342,DOCTOR: You may rise. I am most displeased. Who is in command here? 
343,AGAMEMNON: I have that honour. 
344,DOCTOR: As I have always understood. Yet this mountebank Odysseus
345,"appears to be a law unto himself. He makes fun of his guests, and"
346,laughs at Zeus. 
347,"AGAMEMNON: He will be reprimanded, if you are indeed who you say you"
348,are. 
349,"DOCTOR: If I am not a god, how do you account for my supernatural"
350,knowledge? 
351,AGAMEMNON: Knowledge of what? 
352,DOCTOR: I could tell you one or two things that might surprise you. 
353,AGAMEMNON: Oh? Name one. 
354,"DOCTOR: Your wife, for instance, is unfaithful to you. "
355,AGAMEMNON: What! 
356,ODYSSEUS: Everyone knows that. 
357,MENELAUS: I've never heard it. 
358,"ODYSSEUS: Everyone, that is, except you and him, of course. "
359,AGAMEMNON: Silence! I will not have my wife's name banded about like
360,"that. Besides, we have no way of checking on your slanderous"
361,"assertions, divinely inspired or no. What do you advise? "
362,"DOCTOR: Then treat me with honour and return me to my temple, before I"
363,really become angry. 
364,"ACHILLES: I tell you, Agamemnon, he has come to help us. "
365,"DOCTOR: If I were an enemy, what could one man do alone and unarmed"
366,"against the glory that is Greece, hmm? "
367,"AGAMEMNON: Glory that is Greece, hmm? A neat phrase. "
368,"ODYSSEUS: The man is a spy. Deal with him and be brief, or I shall"
369,undertake it for you. 
370,"ACHILLES: After I am dead, Odysseus, and only then. "
371,"ODYSSEUS: If you so insist, I shall be most happy to oblige, Lightfoot."
372,
373,"AGAMEMNON: Silence! This is time for thought, not swordplay. "
374,"ODYSSEUS: Well, since my thoughts are of such little account, allow me"
375,to withdraw. 
376,"ACHILLES: Forgive him, father Zeus. The man is a boor. If you command"
377,"me, I will deal with him. "
378,"DOCTOR: No, no, Achilles, leave him. Why try to kill him now when you"
379,are in sight of victory. 
380,AGAMEMNON: Do you prophesy as much as that? 
381,DOCTOR: I could almost guarantee it. 
382,"MENELAUS: Almost? Oh, not another ten years. "
383,"DOCTOR: But first I would like to know am I to be treated as a god, or"
384,"as an enemy? If you kill me now, it will probably cost you the war. "
385,"AGAMEMNON: Yes, that is so. On the other hand, if we don't kill you and"
386,"you are a spy, the same thing might happen. I propose to place you"
387,under arrest. 
388,"DOCTOR: Arrest? But I must return to my TAR, er, my temple. "
389,AGAMEMNON: A reverent arrest. You must not be offended. We shall enjoy
390,"the benefit of your experience and your advice, and in return you will"
391,enjoy our hospitality. 
392,DOCTOR: Very well. 
393,AGAMEMNON: Excellent. Do sit down and have a ham bone. 
394,"(Resigned to his fate, the Doctor joins Agamemnon and his brother at"
395,their table.)
396,
397,[Greek camp]
398,
399,Steven has waited until nightfall to approach the
400,"Greek encampment. Now, under cover of darkness, he picks his way"
401,"towards the lights of the camp, dodging past the dozen sentries. But"
402,Steven's progress is observed from the shadows by a man with a patch
403,"over one eye. The Greek spy, Cyclops. Odysseus meanwhile dismisses the"
404,guard outside Agamemnon's tent in the hope of overhearing something of
405,use from within.) 
406,ODYSSEUS: Get thee to thy rest. 
407,"(Once the guard has gone, Cyclops emerges from the shadows.) "
408,"ODYSSEUS: Ah, my little Cyclops. What news, hmm? "
409,(Cyclops gestures.) 
410,"ODYSSEUS: The stranger? Ah, the other stranger. Another stranger. From"
411,the temple. Temple. In the camp! You think he is my enemy. You have
412,"done well. Now, my little chatterbox, go back to the temple, see what"
413,"happens, hmm? "
414,(Odysseus spots Steven approaching.) 
415,ODYSSEUS: Get you gone. 
416,(Cyclops leaves and Odysseus ducks out of sight. As Steven peers into
417,"the tent, the Greek appears out of the shadows behind him.) "
418,"ODYSSEUS: What have we here? Another god, perhaps? "
419,"STEVEN: No, I'm just a traveller. I lost my way and saw the light. "
420,"ODYSSEUS: At least the god Apollo, to walk invisible past sentries. "
421,STEVEN: Sentries? I saw no sentries. 
422,ODYSSEUS: Oh? Then perhaps they are sleeping with a knife between their

424,STEVEN: Put away your sword. I'm a friend. 
425,ODYSSEUS: But a friend of whom? 
426,STEVEN: What do you mean? 
427,"ODYSSEUS: That, that god who feasts yonder, that Trojan spy. "
428,STEVEN: I don't know him. 
429,ODYSSEUS: Do you not? We shall see! Move!

432,
433,(Odysseus pushes Steven into Agamemnon's tent.) 
434,AGAMEMNON: Who is this? 
435,"ODYSSEUS: My prisoner, the god Apollo. Achilles, will you not worship"
436,"him? He is a Trojan spy, but of such undoubted divinity he must be"
437,spared. 
438,"AGAMEMNON: Are you a Trojan, fellow? "
439,"STEVEN: No, of course not. I'm just a traveller, of a sort. "
440,AGAMEMNON: Do you know this man? 
441,DOCTOR: Only for what he seems to be. 
442,"ODYSSEUS: An acquaintance from Olympus, come to meet his father. "
443,STEVEN: My father? I've never seen him before in my life. 
444,"AGAMEMNON: That's enough! Take him away, Odysseus. Why should I be"
445,"troubled with such petty prisoners? Cut out his tongue for insolence,"
446,and make an end. 
447,"ODYSSEUS: Softly now! All-seeing Zeus, you see into our very hearts and"
448,know their secrets? 
449,DOCTOR: Quite so. 
450,ODYSSEUS: Then is this man a spy? 
451,"DOCTOR: I do not know, and I do not care. "
452,ODYSSEUS: Shall he then be put to death? 
453,DOCTOR: I think it would be much safer on the whole. Stop! Have you
454,lost your senses? 
455,"ODYSSEUS: Now we have it! On second thoughts, you think we should"
456,release him to return to Troy. 
457,"DOCTOR: Do not mock me, my Lord Odysseus. Would you stain the tent of"
458,Agamemnon's with a Trojan's blood? I claim this man as a sacrifice to
459,"Olympus! Bring him to my temple in the plain, at sunrise in the"
460,"morning, and I will show you a miracle. "
461,"ODYSSEUS: A miracle. Oh, that would be most satisfactory. "
462,"MENELAUS: Convincing proof, I would say. "
463,AGAMEMNON: What sort of miracle would 
464,DOCTOR: I will strike him with a bolt from heaven! 
465,ODYSSEUS: Very spectacular! 
466,(Two guards drag the struggling Cyclops into the tent.
467,"AGAMEMNON: Ah, what's this? Who's this? "
468,ODYSSEUS: Release him. 
469,"AGAMEMNON: All right, Odysseus. Who is this man? "
470,ODYSSEUS: My Cyclops. My little servant. So. 
471,"AGAMEMNON: Well, can't he speak? "
472,"ODYSSEUS: Alas no more. For once he spoke too loud for comfort, and"
473,stammered on a knife. But he speaks to me. Get you gone and wait for
474,"me. Thunder at the temple tomorrow, did you say? "
475,"DOCTOR: Yes, I did. "
476,ODYSSEUS: Our weather is so unpredictable. If there is no thunder on
477,"the plain, I have a sword will serve for two as well as one. Your"
478,"temple, as you call it, has disappeared. "
479,DOCTOR: Disappeared? 
480,ODYSSEUS: Vanished into thin air.

486,"(The following morning, the Doctor, Steven,"
487,"Agamemnon, Odysseus and a company of soldiers travel to the place where"
488,the Tardis landed. There is no sign of the ship.) 
489,"AGAMEMNON: Well, father Zeus, where is this temple of yours? "
490,"DOCTOR: Well, it should be about here somewhere. Rather hard to"
491,"understand, these sandy plains are so much alike. "
492,"AGAMEMNON: Well, something has been here. Look. "
493,"ODYSSEUS: And someone, too. For see, some several tracks lead off to"
494,"Troy. Lord Agamemnon, admit your fault. These men are spies! "
495,"AGAMEMNON: So it would begin to seem. Bring on the prisoner. Well,"
496,"father Zeus, you have but one chance left to prove yourself. Kill this"
497,Trojan spy. 
498,"ODYSSEUS: Yes, fling a thunderbolt or some such to rise to the"
499,occasion. 
500,DOCTOR: This sacrifice can only be performed within the temple. 
501,"ODYSSEUS: Which temple is in Troy, therefore would we release you? Just"
502,so. I for one have had enough. 
503,"DOCTOR: Do not labour this point. I am not Zeus, and this young man is"
504,"a friend of mine. Neither of us are Trojans, sir. "
505,AGAMEMNON: I care not who you are. Seize him! It is enough that you
506,have trifled with my credulity and made me look a fool in front of all
507,"my captains. Now, finish the business and be brief. And do not bring"
508,"their bodies back. Let them rot here, so that they can be an example to"
509,their fellows. 
510,STEVEN: Are you quite sure Vicki couldn't have dematerialised the
511,Tardis? 
512,DOCTOR: Of course she couldn't. I told you last night. 
513,"ODYSSEUS: First of all, myrmidons. Who are you? "
514,DOCTOR: I think you had better tell him. 
515,"STEVEN: Yes, well, this may take some time. "
516,"ODYSSEUS: I will be patient. But this time, if you value your lives, do"
517,not lie to me.

524,"PRIAM: Silence! Great Horse of Asia, is none of us to rest? Who's"
525,there? 
526,"PARIS: Paris, father, returned from patrol. "
527,"PRIAM: Well, what news? Have you avenged your brother Hector? Have you?"
528,Have you killed Achilles? 
529,"PARIS: I sought Achilles, father, even to the Grecian lines, but he"
530,skulked within his tent. He feared to face me. 
531,PRIAM: Well go back and wait until he gets his courage up. Upon my
532,"soul, what sort of brother are you? Furthermore, what sort of son?"
533,"What, what is that you have got there? "
534,"PARIS: Ah. A prize, father, captured from the Greeks. "
535,"PRIAM: Hmm, captured, you say? I wager they were glad to see the back"
536,of it. What is it? 
537,"PARIS: What is it? Well, it's, ah it's, ah sort of, er, a shrine, or so"
538,it seems. 
539,"(King Priam strides up to the Tardis door and tries to open it. Inside,"
540,Vicki watches with increasing horror as Priam's face looms on the
541,scanner.) 
542,"PRIAM: And what, may I ask, do you propose to do with this seeming"
543,shrine? 
544,"PARIS: Well, I had rather thought of putting it in the temple. "
545,CASSANDRA: Ha! You're not putting that in my temple. 
546,"PRIAM: I should think not indeed, bringing back blessed shrines. Go"
547,"back and bring Achilles' body, if you want to do something useful. Get"
548,back to the war. 
549,CASSANDRA: And take that thing with you. 
550,"PARIS: Oh, really! If you if you knew the weight of this, this, this"
551,"thing. Father, if Cassandra doesn't want it, can't we just leave it"
552,where it is for the moment? 
553,PRIAM: In the middle of the square? 
554,"PARIS: Yes. I mean, it could be a sort of, er, sort of a monument. "
555,CASSANDRA: A monument to what? 
556,"PARIS: Well, to my initiative, for instance. After all, it is the first"
557,sizeable trophy we've captured since the war started. Probably turn out
558,to be very useful. 
559,CASSANDRA: What sort of use would you suggest? 
560,"PARIS: What sort of use. Well, I don't quite know, actually. But, I"
561,"mean, once we've examined it thoroughly, it'll probably prove to have"
562,all sorts of uses. 
563,CASSANDRA: I'm quite sure. Uses to the Greeks. 
564,PARIS: What do you mean? 
565,CASSANDRA: Why do you imagine that they allowed you to capture it? 
566,"PARIS: Allowed me? Allowed me? Now you look here, Cassandra. "
567,CASSANDRA: Where did you find it? 
568,PARIS: Where'd I find it? Where d'you think? Out there in the middle of
569,the plain. 
570,"CASSANDRA: Unguarded, I suppose. "
571,"PARIS: Yes, of course. I, I mean, yes, it was. "
572,CASSANDRA: Just as I thought. Can't you see that you were meant to
573,bring it into Troy? 
574,"PARIS: No, I can't see, quite frankly. "
575,PRIAM: I think I'm beginning to see. 
576,PARIS: What are you two getting at? 
577,CASSANDRA: You've broken my dreams. The auguries were bad this morning.
578,I woke full of foreboding. 
579,PARIS: Never knew her when she didn't. 
580,"PRIAM: Paris, your sister is High Priestess. Let her speak. "
581,"PARIS: All right, Cassandra. Now, what was this dream about? "
582,CASSANDRA: Thank you. I dreamed that out on the plain the Greeks had
583,"left a gift, and although what it was remained unclear, we brought it"
584,"into Troy. Then at night, from out its belly, soldiers came and fell"
585,upon us as we slept. 
586,"PARIS: Yes, well I hardly think we need trouble to interpret that one."
587,"Oh really, Cassandra, have you looked at this thing, as you call it? I"
588,"mean, just how many soldiers do you think you can get inside that? A"
589,"whole regiment, perhaps? I mean, you'd be very lucky to get even two"
590,medium-sized soldiers out of that thing. 
591,CASSANDRA: Fool! One soldier could unbar the gate and so admit an army.
592,It's exactly the sort of scheme Odysseus would think of. 
593,PRIAM: Why don't we open the thing and see? 
594,"PARIS: Yes, well, that is rather the point. You see, there is a door,"
595,but it doesn't seem to open. 
596,"CASSANDRA: Just as I said, it's locked from the inside. "
597,"PRIAM: Oh, it is, is it? Stand aside. "
598,"(Priam attacks the Tardis door with Paris' sword, but to no effect.) "
599,"PARIS: Well, there you are, father. Perhaps you'll believe me next"
600,"time, I suppose. Oh, Cassandra, perhaps you would like to care to have"
601,a try. 
602,"CASSANDRA: The thing need not be opened. Bring branches, fire and"
603,sacrificial oil. We'll make of it an offering to the gods of Troy. And
604,"if there be someone within, so much the greater gift."

614,(Steven meanwhile is trying to explain their
615,presence to Odysseus.) 
616,"STEVEN: So really, you see, we arrived in your time entirely by"
617,accident. It's just another miscalculation by the Doctor. 
618,"DOCTOR: Well, I would hardly call it a miscalculation, my boy. "
619,"STEVEN: Well, then, what would you call it? "
620,"DOCTOR: Well, I think with all eternity to choose from, I did rather"
621,well to get us back to Earth. 
622,STEVEN: I'm very glad you're pleased with yourself. I suppose I should
623,"be grateful for standing here, trussed like a chicken, ready to have me"
624,throat cut. 
625,ODYSSEUS: No one mentioned cutting throats. 
626,"DOCTOR: No, they didn't. "
627,ODYSSEUS: I had I had something more lingering in mind. 
628,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I dare say. I suppose some kind of ritual death, I"
629,presume? 
630,"ODYSSEUS: Sit down. Sit down! In my life I have travelled far, and met"
631,"many deplorable people, but not one of them has had the credulity"
632,"strained as I have strained today by your effrontery, Doctor. Your"
633,"story is probably true, otherwise you would never have dared to tell"
634,it. Stand up! I propose to release you. 
635,STEVEN: We might have expected That's very nice of you. 
636,"ODYSSEUS: No, no, it isn't. Release, but on certain conditions. "
637,"DOCTOR: And what are those conditions, may I ask? "
638,ODYSSEUS: That you use your supernatural knowledge to devise a scheme
639,whereby we capture Troy. I will give you two days. Two days to think of
640,something really ingenious. 
641,"DOCTOR: Two days! That isn't very long, is it. "
642,ODYSSEUS: It should be ample if you are as clever as you say you are. 
643,STEVEN: What happens if we fail? 
644,"ODYSSEUS: If I fail, then I shall have been foolish. And I would hate"
645,"to seem foolish having believed your story. Indeed, I should be very,"
646,very angry!

655,PRIAM: That should make quite a blaze. 
656,"PARIS: Yes. Just one moment. Before we actually light the fire,"
657,shouldn't we see if such a gift would be acceptable to the gods? I
658,"mean, if it does contain treachery, might it not seem the most awful"
659,insult? 
660,"PRIAM: Oh, good point, I suppose. Have a word with them, Cassandra. "
661,CASSANDRA: I assure you it's quite unnecessary. 
662,"PARIS: Yes, but better to be on the safe side. Don't you think? "
663,"CASSANDRA: Oh, hear me, you horses of the heavens, who gallop with our"
664,"destiny. If you would accept this gift, let us see a sign. Show us your"
665,"will, I pray you, for we are merely mortal and need your guidance. "
666,"(At that moment, Vicki steps down from the Tardis, dressed in an"
667,elegant gown.)

671,PRIAM: And this is no soldier either. 
672,CASSANDRA: Who are you? 
673,VICKI: I'm nobody of any importance. I'm just someone from the future. 
674,PARIS: The future? 
675,CASSANDRA: How do you so? You're no Trojan goddess. Are you some puny
676,pagan goddess of the Greeks? 
677,VICKI: Of course not. I'm as human as you are. 
678,CASSANDRA: Then how comes it that you claim to know the future?

684,I shouldn't imagine you have a monopoly. 
685,CASSANDRA: Are you a priestess? 
686,"VICKI: Not that I know of. I mean, I never took any exams or anything. "
687,CASSANDRA: Then how dare you practice prophecy! 
688,"VICKI: Well, I haven't done yet, have I? "
689,"CASSANDRA: She's some drab of Agamemnon's, sent to spread dissention. "
690,VICKI: I'm nothing of the sort. 
691,PARIS: Of course you're not. I can tell. 
692,VICKI: I've never even met Agamemnon. 
693,"PRIAM: I wish to question her. Come here, child. That's better. Now,"
694,are you a Greek? 
695,"VICKI: No, I am from the future. So you see, I don't have to prophesy,"
696,"because as far as I'm concerned, the future has already happened! "
697,PRIAM: I don't quite follow. 
698,CASSANDRA: Of course you don't. She's trying to confuse you. Kill the
699,girl before she addles all our wits. She's a sorceress. She must die. 
700,"PARIS: Oh, don't be absurd. You're not to touch her. "
701,PRIAM: I wish you'd both keep quiet just for a moment. Now don't be
702,"frightened, child. You shall die when I say so, and not a moment"
703,before. 
704,VICKI: That's very comforting. 
705,"PRIAM: Now, you see? Neither of you has the least idea how to handle"
706,"children. All you need is a little kindness and understanding. Now,"
707,"first of all, what is your name? "
708,VICKI: Vicki. 
709,PRIAM: Vicki? That's a very outlandish name. 
710,"CASSANDRA: A heathen sort of name, if you ask me. "
711,"PRIAM: Nobody did ask you, Cassandra. Well, I really don't think we can"
712,"call you Vicki. We shall have to think another one for you, shan't we?"
713,"Let me see, how about, Cressida. Would you think that would be all"
714,right? 
715,VICKI: It's a very pretty name. 
716,"PRIAM: Very well, then. Cressida it shall be. Now you claim, Cressida,"
717,to come from the future?

719,PRIAM: So you know everything that's going to happen. 
720,"VICKI: Well, I "
721,"PRIAM: Look, Cressida, come into the palace. I expect you could do with"
722,something to eat. 
723,"VICKI: Oh, thank you, that would be very nice. "
724,"PARIS: Ah, that's a very good idea, I've not eaten since the "
725,PRIAM: You get back to the war! If you've not killed Achilles by
726,"nightfall, I shall be seriously displeased. "
727,"PARIS: But look, father, why couldn't Troilus go? I mean, it's much"
728,more his sort of thing. 
729,"PRIAM: Hector. Don't argue, Paris! Get back to the war! "
730,"PARIS: Right. Well, bye, Cressida. We shall meet again this evening,"
731,all being well. 
732,"VICKI: Goodbye, Paris. Thank you very much for trying to help me. "
733,"PARIS: Oh, not at all. It was a great pleasure. "
734,"PRIAM: Come, Cressida. You and I have a great deal to say to each"
735,other. I have a feeling you are going to bring us luck. 
736,"CASSANDRA: She will bring nothing but doom, death and disaster. "
737,PRIAM: Don't pay any attention to Cassandra. She takes the gloomiest
738,"view. I suspect it's a kind of insurance, so that if things do go wrong"
739,she can always say 'I told you so.' Come along. 
740,"CASSANDRA: Hear me, gods of Troy. Strike with your lightnings this"
741,"usurper. Or show me a sign that she is false, and then I'll strike her"

748,STEVEN: Why not the wooden horse? 
749,"DOCTOR: Oh, my dear boy, I couldn't possibly suggest that. The whole"
750,story is obviously absurd. Probably invented by Homer as some good
751,"dramatic device. No, I think it would be completely impractical. "
752,"STEVEN: Yes, well, if you say so, Doctor. But in that case, hurry up"
753,and think of something else. The only way we can rescue Vicki is to get
754,into Troy. We've only got two days left. 
755,"DOCTOR: Oh, patience, my "
756,ODYSSEUS: Rather less now. Haven't you thought of anything yet? 
757,"DOCTOR: Yes. Well, I have thought up of some conditions of my own. "
758,"ODYSSEUS: Oh, really? I don't see how you're going to enforce them, but"
759,what are they? 
760,"DOCTOR: Well, it's all very simple. That is, if you want me to help you"
761,"sack the city, you must promise me that Vicki will be spared. "
762,ODYSSEUS: Vicki? Who's she? 
763,"STEVEN: Oh, you know, I told you about her. Look, if they have taken"
764,"the time machine into Troy, then she'll still be inside it. "
765,"ODYSSEUS: I hope she is, for her sake. Because if she left it, she's"
766,past worrying about now. 
767,"DOCTOR: Well, we're not quite sure of that, are we? "
768,"ODYSSEUS: Perhaps not, but I don't know what you expect me to do about"
769,"it. When we enter Troy, I can't stop every woman and ask her if she's a"
770,friend of yours. It wouldn't be practical.

793,"ODYSSEUS: Well, I don't know what they're doing with their prisoners of"

795,"time, I imagine. They're a very unpredictable lot, these Trojans. "

801,particular use here. 
802,STEVEN: What about the uniform?

825,"PARIS: Ah. No, you're not Achilles. Are you? "
826,"STEVEN: I am Diomede, friend of Odysseus. "
827,"PARIS: Oh, Diomede, I do not want your blood. It's Achilles I seek. "
828,"STEVEN: And must my Lord Achilles be roused to undertake your death,"
829,adulterer? 
830,"PARIS: Yes, well, I'm prepared to overlook that for the moment. I"
831,assure you I have no quarrel with you. 
832,"STEVEN: I'm Greek, you're Trojan. Is not that quarrel enough? "
833,"PARIS: Yes, well personally, I think this whole business has been"
834,"carried just a little bit too far. I mean, that Helen thing was just a"
835,misunderstanding. 
836,STEVEN: Which I now propose to resolve. Draw your sword. 
837,"PARIS: Oh, right. Well, you'll be sorry for this, I promise you. "
838,"(Steven and Paris fight with surprising skill, circling round each"
839,"other and trading blows. Steven keeps his guard up, then pretends to"
840,trip and falls to one knee.) 
841,"PARIS: Now, die, Greek, and tell them in Hades that Paris sent you"
842,thither! 
843,STEVEN: I yield. 
844,PARIS: I beg your pardon? 
845,STEVEN: I yield. I'm your prisoner. 
846,"PARIS: Well, I say, this sort of thing is just not done. I mean, surely"
847,you'd rather die than be taken prisoner? 
848,"STEVEN: Well, yes, but, only in a general sort of way, you see. You"
849,"see, when I first challenged you, little did I know that you were"
850,indeed the Lion of Troy. 
851,"PARIS: Yes, I "
852,STEVEN: I should have listened to my friends. 
853,PARIS: Why? What do they say? 
854,"STEVEN: Why, that they would rather face Prince Hector and Troilus"
855,together than the mighty Paris. That you are unconquerable. 
856,PARIS: Really? They don't say that in Troy. 
857,"STEVEN: Oh, I could tell them a tale or two of your valour that that"
858,would make even King Priam blanch to hear. 
859,"PARIS: I say, could you really? "
860,"STEVEN: Yes, and will. Why, I hope my Lord Achilles does not meet you."
861,"Even now he searches the plain for you, and what indeed would happen to"
862,our cause if he were vanquished? 
863,"PARIS: Well, I don't really see how I can oblige him if I have a"
864,"prisoner. I mean, there will come a day of reckoning, of course, but,"
865,"well, for the moment, pick up your sword! Now, I suppose I shall have"
866,"to drive you like a Grecian cur into the city, won't I? Excuse me a"
867,"moment. Farewell, Achilles! For today, Paris of Troy has other"
868,"business! Come, dog! (Paris retrieves his sword and they depart for"
869,"Troy) Oh, yes."

873,"(Vicki, meanwhile, is dining with King Priam.) "
874,"VICKI: Oh, thank you, that was delicious. "
875,PRIAM: You're sure you wouldn't like a little more breast of peacock? 
876,"VICKI: No, thank you. I couldn't eat another mouthful. How on earth do"
877,you manage to live like this when you're under siege? 
878,PRIAM: My nephew Aeneas brings us a little something from time to time.
879,He's in command of our mobile force. Spends most of his time harrying
880,the Greek supply routes with his cavalry. 
881,VICKI: I didn't know cavalry was invented yet? 
882,"PRIAM: Oh, bless my soul, yes. We are basically horsemen. Our ancestors"
883,"came from central Asia, found this strategic position and chose to"
884,fortify it. We only need now to beat the Greeks a few score more
885,horses. 
886,VICKI: You seem very fond of horses. 
887,PRIAM: Fond of them? I should think we are. We worship them. A Trojan
888,would do anything for a horse. 
889,VICKI: Funny you should say that. 
890,"PRIAM: Funny, why? What do you mean? "
891,"VICKI: Well, it's nothing. It's just a story I heard a long time ago. "
892,PRIAM: A story about this war? 
893,"VICKI: Well, yes. But it's nothing. I'm sure it's just a legend. "
894,"PRIAM: What sort of a legend? Cressida, I'm relying on you to tell us"
895,everything you remember. The smallest thing may be of importance. 
896,"VICKI: Yes. Prince Troilus, who was here just now. Is he your youngest"
897,son? 
898,"PRIAM: Troilus? Oh yes. He's about the same age as you, I suppose. But"
899,why do you ask? I though we were supposed to be talking about 
900,"VICKI: He's very good-looking, isn't he? "
901,"PRIAM: Is he? Oh, I never noticed myself. I don't particularly notice"
902,good looks. Only gets you into trouble. Look at Paris. Handsome as the
903,"devil, but a complete coward. "
904,VICKI: I thought he was rather nice. 
905,"PRIAM: Yes, women generally do. That's what got us into all this"
906,"trouble. Oh, of course, you've not met Helen yet, have you? "
907,"VICKI: No, I'm looking forward to that. "
908,"PRIAM: Yes, well, she's. Oh, never mind. If only he'd met a nice,"
909,"sensible girl like you. I always say it's character that counts, not"
910,good looks. 
911,"VICKI: Thank you, kindly. "
912,"PRIAM: Oh, no. I didn't mean. Good heavens, no. I wish you wouldn't"
913,"keep changing the subject, Cressida. Funny you should say that about"
914,Troilus. I thought he was rather taken with you. 
915,VICKI: Did you really think so? 
916,PRIAM: Of course I did. I thought we were supposed to be talking about
917,the war. Now don't keep changing the subject. You were saying something
918,about a legend. 
919,"VICKI: Was I? Yes. Well, you see "
920,PARIS: Father! I've captured a Greek! 
921,"PRIAM: Paris, when will you learn to stop bursting in here when I'm"
922,busy? 
923,"PARIS: Oh. Well, I just thought you might want to question him, that's"
924,all. 
925,"PRIAM: Well I may do so in due course, but "
926,"PARIS: Oh good, he's just outside. "
927,"PRIAM: Oh, you've not brought him here, into the palace? "
928,"PARIS: Oh, don't worry. He's thoroughly calm. "
929,PRIAM: That's not the point. 
930,"PARIS: Yes, well, now he is here, couldn't I just bring him in? "
931,"PRIAM: Oh, I suppose so. "
932,PARIS: Good. 
933,"PRIAM: I'm sorry, Cressida. This is utterly unforgiveable. "
934,"PARIS: Here, Diomede! Come on, step lively now! "
935,VICKI: Steven! What on earth are you? 
936,"STEVEN: Shh, Vicki. "
937,PRIAM: What was that he called her? 
938,"CASSANDRA: You heard, didn't you? That was the name she called herself"
939,"when we found her. And she recognised him too. Since he's a Greek, what"
940,more proof do you need that she's a spy? Guards! Kill her. Kill both of
941,them! 
942,(Vicki runs to Steven's arms as the guards draw their swords and
943,advance.)

945, Episode Three - Death
946,of a Spy 
947, [Priam's palace]
948,
949,VICKI: No! No! 
950,"PARIS: Guards, sheath arms! And since when have you given orders to the"
951,military? I'm in command here! 
952,CASSANDRA: Of everything except your senses. 
953,PARIS: I am at present officer commanding all Trojan forces/ 
954,CASSANDRA: Ha! 
955,PARIS: And I will not tolerate interference from a fortune-teller of
956,notorious unreliability. 
957,CASSANDRA: How dare you! I am High Priestess of Troy! 
958,"PARIS: All right then, get back to your temple before you give us all"
959,"galloping religious mania. Oh, really, father. I can't tolerate another"
960,of her tedious tirades at the moment. 
961,"CASSANDRA: Father, do you hear him? "
962,"PRIAM: Yes, it's quite refreshing. It seems there's a man lurking"
963,behind that flaccid facade after all. 
964,"PARIS: Really, father, I do wish you'd refrain from patronising me in"
965,front of the prisoner. 
966,"PRIAM: The prisoner. Oh, that's it. One pathetic prisoner and he thinks"
967,he's Hercules. Your success has gone to your head. 
968,"PARIS: Just before you start sneering at this prisoner, perhaps you"
969,should know that his name is Diomede. And if you look in the Greek army
970,"lists, you'll see he's quite a catch. "
971,"STEVEN: Which none but you could have caught, oh Lion of Troy. "
972,CASSANDRA: What was that? 
973,"PARIS: Well, there you are, you see. Right. Go on, go on. Tell them,"
974,Diomede. 
975,STEVEN: We fought. I lost. I am not ashamed. There is none in all our
976,ranks who could stand against the wrath of Paris when he seeks revenge.
977,
978,"PARIS: Yes, very good. Very good, yes. There you are, you see? I'm"
979,treated with more respect by the enemy than I am by my own family. 
980,CASSANDRA: They don't know you as well as we do. 
981,PARIS: Perhaps better! And perhaps the time has come for you to start
982,"revising your opinions, sister. "
983,CASSANDRA: You forget one thing. Your prisoner and that girl have
984,clearly met before. 
985,VICKI: Why won't you let me explain that. It's really all quite simple.
986,
987,"PRIAM: Yes, I'm sure it is. But Paris claimed Diomede here as a Greek"
988,prisoner. And Cassandra claims that you are a Greek spy. 
989,CASSANDRA: And a sorceress. 
990,"PRIAM: Yes, quite. After all, you do claim to know the future. "
991,"VICKI: Yes, but don't you see, that's "
992,"PRIAM: Hush, my child. This war with the Greeks has been going on for"
993,"ten long years, and frankly we're very bored with being penned up here."
994,"Now if you are what you really say you are, as a pledge of good faith"
995,"to us, you must either give me information that will lead to our speedy"
996,"victory, or use your supernatural powers to turn the tide of battle in"
997,our favour. 
998,VICKI: But suppose I don't? Suppose the Greeks win? 
999,"CASSANDRA: You will be burnt as a sorceress, a false prophet, and a"
1000,spy. 
1001,"PRIAM: Well, as one of them, anyway. But I have every confidence in"
1002,"you, Cressida. And I will give you one whole day to decide which to do."
1003,
1004,STEVEN: One day? 
1005,PRIAM: Yes. 
1006,STEVEN: But 
1007,"PRIAM: Till tomorrow evening, to be precise. Now if you have no"
1008,"objection, I think they ought to be taken away. "
1009,"PARIS: Oh, yes, yes, I think that's all very fair. "
1010,VICKI: Where are they taking us? 
1011,"PRIAM: To the dungeons. Oh, don't worry, you'll find them quite"
1012,comfortable. I often spend an hour or two down there myself when I've
1013,got tired of things up here. 
1014,STEVEN: How long do you intend to keep us there? 
1015,CASSANDRA: Till you rot. 
1016,"PRIAM: Oh, well really, Cassandra. Though that may be true in your"
1017,"case, Diomede, but I trust Cressida will join us before tomorrow"
1018,evening. 
1019,"PARIS: Oh, yes, yes, right. Guards, take them away."

1022,
1023,(The Doctor is hard at work at a make-shift desk in
1024,the Greek camp when Odysseus comes looking for him.) 
1025,"ODYSSEUS: Well, Doctor, you have one day left. What progress are you"
1026,making? 
1027,"DOCTOR: Considerable. Here. Now, you just take that for a moment. Now,"
1028,pay attention please. 
1029,"(With the air of a magician, the Doctor folds a piece of parchment into"
1030,a paper aeroplane) 
1031,ODYSSEUS: What is it? 
1032,"DOCTOR: Well, what does it look like? A flying machine. "
1033,ODYSSEUS: Looks like a parchment dart to me. My boy makes these to
1034,annoy his tutors. 
1035,"DOCTOR: Excellent! Since you're so familiar with this project, then"
1036,it's so much easier for me to talk to you. Come along. Come along. 
1037,ODYSSEUS: Huh! 
1038,"DOCTOR: Now, of course you realise that we can build a much larger one,"
1039,capable of carrying a man. 
1040,ODYSSEUS: I suppose so. What good would that be? 
1041,"DOCTOR: Oh, think, my dear Odysseus. A whole fleet of them carrying a"
1042,company of soldiers over the walls and into Troy. 
1043,ODYSSEUS: How would we get them into the air? 
1044,DOCTOR: Catapults! 
1045,ODYSSEUS: Catapults? That sounds like a vulgar oath to me! I must try
1046,it on Agamemnon. Catapults! 
1047,"DOCTOR: Nonsense! The catapult is, well, you could make one for"
1048,"yourself out of strips of ox hide, and secure both ends, and then"
1049,stretch it out like a bow-string. 
1050,ODYSSEUS: I see. 
1051,"DOCTOR: Then you pour water over it, let it dry in the sun, and what"
1052,happens then? 
1053,ODYSSEUS: It begins to smell. 
1054,"DOCTOR: Never mind that. It shrinks. Now, allow me to demonstrate. You"
1055,"place the flying machine thus, as you would an arrow in a bow, and let"
1056,it go. 
1057,ODYSSEUS: What happens? 
1058,DOCTOR: The machine flies in the air with a soldier clinging to its
1059,back. 
1060,"ODYSSEUS: Yes, well, here's one soldier who's doing nothing of the"
1061,sort. 
1062,"DOCTOR: Agamemnon, then. "
1063,ODYSSEUS: That might be quite an idea. 
1064,DOCTOR: Thank you. I thought you'd like it. 
1065,"ODYSSEUS: Agamemnon wouldn't do it, though. "
1066,DOCTOR: Oh? Why not? 
1067,ODYSSEUS: He'd object most strongly. We'll have to think of someone
1068,else. 
1069,"DOCTOR: Well, anyone could do it, for that matter. I mean, even a child"
1070,could operate it. 
1071,"ODYSSEUS: I'm very glad to hear you say that, Doctor, because I intend"
1072,to build this flying machine. 
1073,"DOCTOR: Excellent, excellent! "
1074,ODYSSEUS: And you shall have the honour of being the first man to fly!
1075,
1076,[Trojan dungeon]
1077,
1078,"VICKI: If you hadn't called me Vicki, we wouldn't"
1079,be here now. 
1080,"STEVEN: Look, you called me by my name first. "
1081,VICKI: Only because I was surprised to see you. I can't think why you
1082,"disguised yourself as a Greek, anyway. "
1083,STEVEN: I disguised myself so that I could rescue you. 
1084,"VICKI: You succeeded beautifully. Thanks, Diomede. "
1085,"STEVEN: Oh, look, be fair. How was I to know that you'd manage to get"
1086,round King Priam? 
1087,VICKI: You might have guessed. I know how to take care of myself. Why
1088,couldn't you have disguised yourself as a Trojan? It would have been
1089,far more sensible. 
1090,STEVEN: Because I haven't got a Trojan uniform. If you're so clever at
1091,"looking after yourself, you'd better start thinking of a way to get out"
1092,"of here, and fast. "
1093,"VICK: What do you mean, fast? "
1094,"STEVEN: Yesterday, the Doctor was given two days to capture Troy, and"
1095,"if I know him, he'll probably succeed. "
1096,"VICKI: Well, that's all right then. We shall be rescued. "
1097,"STEVEN: Rescued? You'll be lucky! Look, may I point out that in the one"
1098,"day that the Doctor now has left, you have to think of a way of saving"
1099,the city and defeating the Greeks. 
1100,VICKI: Oh. I hadn't thought of it like that. 
1101,"STEVEN: Well, you'd better start, because I don't think Cassandra's"
1102,going to wait until the city falls before she gets rid of you. 
1103,"VICKI: Paris wouldn't let her do that, neither would Troilus. "
1104,STEVEN: Troilus? 
1105,VICKI: Paris's younger brother. He likes me. I like him. 
1106,STEVEN: I don't think that's going to matter much when the city starts
1107,"to burn. Now, come on, start thinking. It's you against the Doctor now."
1108,
1109,"VICKI: Oh Steven, what can we do to stop him? Do you know what he was"
1110,planning? 
1111,"STEVEN: Oh, I've no idea. I suggested the wooden horse. He said that"
1112,was something Homer made up. 
1113,VICKI: What was that? 
1114,STEVEN: Some fool throwing stones at us. Probably stirred up by
1115,Cassandra. 
1116,"VICKI: Except for her, they were all quite friendly to me. "
1117,STEVEN: Vicki! It's the Cyclops! 
1118,VICKI: What? 
1119,"STEVEN: The servant of Odysseus. Look, Cyclops, can you understand me?"
1120,Tell them. Tell them that I've found our other friend. Yes? That they
1121,"mustn't attack Troy. That's it, the city. They mustn't attack Troy"
1122,"until the day after tomorrow. Otherwise, we'll both be killed, this"
1123,girl and I. You understand? 
1124,VICKI: Glad he thinks that's funny. 
1125,"STEVEN: Look. Tell, tell the old man. "
1126,"TROILUS : Cressida, what's going on? "
1127,"VICKI: Oh, Troilus! "
1128,TROILUS: What were you doing? 
1129,"VICKI: Ah, nothing. Just watching Diomede examining those things in"
1130,there. 
1131,TROILUS: What are you doing up there? 
1132,STEVEN: Just admiring the view. It's a very handsome square out here. 
1133,"TROILUS: Perhaps, but you're supposed to sit in your cell and be quiet."
1134,"You weren't talking to him, were you? You're not supposed to. "
1135,"VICKI: Oh, no. I was just watching. "
1136,TROILUS: I brought you some food. 
1137,"VICKI: Oh, thank you. I though I'd been forgotten. You can tell me"
1138,what's going on while I eat. 
1139,TROILUS: I'm not allowed to talk to you. 
1140,VICKI: Why not? 
1141,TROILUS: I'm on duty. 
1142,"VICKI: Well, can't you even "
1143,"TROILUS: I'm sorry, Cressida, but I must obey orders. "
1144,(Vicki sits down sullenly and begins eating.) 
1145,VICKI: Mmm. This is very good. Would you like some? Go on. Try some. 
1146,"TROILUS: Well, actually, I have already eaten."

1149,
1150,"(Back in his tent, Odysseus watches as the Doctor"
1151,paces back and forth.) 
1152,ODYSSEUS: Will you keep still? 
1153,DOCTOR: I'm thinking. 
1154,"ODYSSEUS: Well, think sitting down. Now you said your plans were ready."
1155,I've got half a company of men standing by to make this machine of
1156,yours. 
1157,DOCTOR: Dismiss them then. 
1158,"ODYSSEUS: What? You have very little time left, Doctor. "
1159,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm quite well aware of that, but I'm afraid this machine"
1160,isn't going to work. 
1161,ODYSSEUS: You mean you're too frightened to fly it yourself. 
1162,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. It isn't that. Not at all. I've made a mistake in"
1163,my calculations. 
1164,ODYSSEUS: A mistake? 
1165,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes. I'm afraid we must face up to it, Odysseus, man was"
1166,never meant to fly. 
1167,"ODYSSEUS: Wasn't he now? Well, that seems to me a great shame. Now if"
1168,"your machine won't work, Doctor, I propose to fly you without it. "
1169,DOCTOR: Oh? What do you mean? 
1170,ODYSSEUS: Simply this. That my catapult is ready and it seems a great
1171,"pity to waste it. Now you have failed me, therefore you are expendable."
1172,I propose to fire you over the walls of Troy. 
1173,"DOCTOR: Ah, but I have another idea. And a much better one. "
1174,ODYSSEUS: It had better be. Well? 
1175,DOCTOR: Have you ever thought of a horse? 
1176,ODYSSEUS: Is that supposed to be funny? 
1177,"DOCTOR: It should be a huge horse, about forty feet high. "
1178,ODYSSEUS: What good would that be? 
1179,"DOCTOR: We build it hollow, and we fill it with soldiers and leave it"
1180,on the sandy plain for the Trojans to capture it. 
1181,ODYSSEUS: And it's just possible that the Trojans will come out and
1182,take the horse back into the city. 
1183,DOCTOR: And the Greeks pretend to sail away. 
1184,"ODYSSEUS: Yes. Yes, that's quite an idea, Doctor."
1185,
1186,[Trojan dungeon]
1187,
1188,"TROILUS: No, of course not. I It was just that"
1189,Cassandra went on so about your being a witch! 
1190,VICKI: And you thought I might put a spell on you? 
1191,"TROILUS: Well, no. Of course not. I'd like to see you try it. You're"
1192,"not a witch, are you? "
1193,VICKI: Of course not. Do I look like one? 
1194,"TROILUS: Well, no, but then, I've never met one. Look here, I shouldn't"
1195,be talking to you like this. And what are you laughing at? 
1196,"VICKI: Well, you're not in the war, are you? You're far too young. "
1197,TROILUS: I'm seventeen next birthday! 
1198,VICKI: That's hardly any older than me. You shouldn't be killing people
1199,at your age. 
1200,"TROILUS: Well, between you and me, I don't honestly enjoy killing at"
1201,all. But I love adventure. 
1202,VICKI: Yes. I know what you mean.

1207,plan to seize Troy.) 
1208,AGAMEMNON: Well? What is this idea of yours? 
1209,"DOCTOR: Well, it's all perfectly simple. "
1210,"ODYSSEUS: Nonsense! Show them the plans, Doctor. It's quite"
1211,"revolutionary. There, what do you make of that? "
1212,"MENELAUS: Eh. Well, it's a horse. Isn't it? "
1213,"ODYSSEUS: Well done, Menelaus. But what sort of horse, that's the"
1214,point. 
1215,"MENELAUS: Ah. Er. Well, a big horse. "
1216,ODYSSEUS: Exactly. A very big horse. 
1217,AGAMEMNON: Is this some sort of joke? 
1218,ODYSSEUS: A horse at least forty feet high. 
1219,"MENELAUS: Oh, but horses don't grow as big as that. Do they? I mean,"
1220,even the Great Horse of Asia that the Trojans worship. 
1221,ODYSSEUS: Now you're beginning to get to the point. Horses don't grow
1222,that high. 
1223,MENELAUS: No. 
1224,"ODYSSEUS: The Great Horse of Asia does not exist, therefore we are"
1225,going to build one for the Trojans as a sort of present. 
1226,AGAMEMNON: Go on. 
1227,"DOCTOR: We build it of wood, and we build it hollow. Then we fill it"
1228,with a picked team of soldiers. 
1229,"MENELAUS: Well, then what do we do? "
1230,"DOCTOR: You take to the ships and sail away, to make the Trojans think"
1231,you've all gone. 
1232,MENELAUS: Excellent. Now that is a good idea. 
1233,"DOCTOR: You all come back again, of course. "
1234,MENELAUS: Why is there always a catch in it? 
1235,DOCTOR: None of this must happen before nightfall. 
1236,ODYSSEUS: Now Achilles will take his Myrmidons and hide out upon the
1237,plain. 
1238,AGAMEMNON: I thought you said the best warriors'd be in the horse? 
1239,ODYSSEUS: So they will be. I shall be there with my Ithacans. 
1240,AGAMEMNON: Eh? 
1241,"ODYSSEUS: My Ithacans, and the Doctor, of course. "
1242,DOCTOR: That wasn't part of the plan. 
1243,ODYSSEUS: It is now. I've just thought of it. I'm standing no more
1244,"nonsense from you, Doctor. "
1245,DOCTOR: That will not be necessary. I shall only get in the way. 
1246,ODYSSEUS: You'd better not do that. Now the rest is up to those
1247,"Trojans. They see that we have gone, they see their Great Horse upon"
1248,"the plain, which has descended from heaven to drive us away. "
1249,DOCTOR: Then they drag the horse into the city. 
1250,AGAMEMNON: Are you sure? Suppose they set fire to it? 
1251,"DOCTOR: Oh, well, that is a calculated risk. But somehow I don't"
1252,believe they'll want to destroy one of their own gods. 
1253,"MENELAUS: Yes, but once they have the horse inside, won't they close"
1254,the gates? 
1255,"ODYSSEUS: Of course they will. But during the night, we shall leave the"
1256,"horse, open up the gates to let you all in again. What more do you"
1257,want? 
1258,MENELAUS: A drink.

1260,[Trojan dungeon]
1261,
1262,"VICKI: There, I've finished. That was lovely. "
1263,TROILUS: Then I'd better go. I've stayed here far too long as it is
1264,already. 
1265,VICKI: Oh. But aren't you going to take some food to Diomede? 
1266,TROILUS: Why? 
1267,"VICKI: Well, perhaps he's hungry too. "
1268,TROILUS: But he's a Greek. He deserves to be hungry. 
1269,"VICKI: Well, perhaps so, but you can't let him starve. "
1270,TROILUS: He won't starve. The guards will throw him a scrap or two
1271,later on. 
1272,"VICKI: Well, that's a very nice attitude, I must say. "
1273,"TROILUS: Look here, is this Diomede a particular friend of yours or"
1274,something? 
1275,"VICKI: A very good friend, yes. "
1276,TROILUS: Well I don't see how you can be friends with a Greek. 
1277,"VICKI: Oh, look, Troilus. When you come from the future you make"
1278,"friends with a lot of people, and he's one of them. "
1279,TROILUS: I see. But he's not in any way special? 
1280,VICKI: No. Why do you keep on? 
1281,"TROILUS: Well, because that's what I was. I mean, that's what the"
1282,others were worried about. 
1283,"VICKI: Oh, yes, well, all right, you can tell them to stop worrying and"
1284,let us out. 
1285,"TROILUS: Yes, yes I will. But I don't suppose anyone will take any"
1286,notice. 
1287,"VICKI: Well, do your best anyway. "
1288,TROILUS: Naturally. I'll let you know what happens. Perhaps I can come
1289,"back later on. If there's any news, that is. "
1290,"VICKI: Well, you know where to find me, don't you? I mean I don't"
1291,expect I shall be going out or anything. 
1292,"TROILUS: I suppose not. Well, goodbye for the present then, Cressida. "
1293,"VICKI: Goodbye, Troilus. "
1294,STEVEN: You ought to be ashamed of yourself. 
1295,VICKI: I don't see why. At least I've done something towards getting us
1296,"out of here, which is more than you have. "
1297,STEVEN: And what chance have I had? 
1298,"VICKI: Anyway, I though he was rather nice. "
1299,"STEVEN: Oh, you made that painfully obvious. And I think you might at"
1300,least have had the decency to have saved me some food. 
1301,(Vicki takes some food from her pocket and hands it over.) 
1302,"STEVEN: Oh, thanks. "
1303,VICKI: The guards are sending you some scraps later. Troilus said so. 
1304,STEVEN: Hmm. Troilus. 
1305,"VICKI: You know, Steven, I think I could get to be quite happy here in"
1306,time. 
1307,"STEVEN: I hate to remind you, but time is the one thing we just haven't"
1308,got. 
1309,VICKI: But you said you'd sent a message to the Doctor. 
1310,"STEVEN: Yeah, well, I think I have. It's hard to tell with the Cyclops."
1311,"In any case, your new boyfriend came in before I'd finished telling him"
1312,everything. 
1313,"VICKI: Well, let's hope he did understand. "
1314,"STEVEN: Yeah, and let's hope he got out of Troy safely. Otherwise we're"
1315,in trouble.

1337,"ODYSSEUS: Oh, what's the matter with you? Have you no faith in your own"
1338,invention? 
1339,"DOCTOR: No, no, Odysseus. It isn't that. But, I just didn't like the"
1340,look of those fetlocks. They've no safety margin at all. 
1341,"ODYSSEUS: Well, they haven't got to last forever. After all, we're not"
1342,"building one of the wonders of the world, are we? As long as that horse"
1343,gets us into Troy it can collapse into a mare's nest for all I care. 
1344,"DOCTOR: Ah, suppose it collapses whilst we're all in it? "
1345,ODYSSEUS: Then we shall all look very foolish indeed. 
1346,"DOCTOR: Yes, and I've no wish to be made a laughing stock. "

1366,"ODYSSEUS: What is it now, Doctor? Upon my soul, you're making me as"
1367,nervous as a Bacchante at her first orgy. Why don't you try and get
1368,some sleep? 
1369,DOCTOR: I've never felt less like sleep in my life. I thought I saw
1370,some movement down there. 
1371,"ODYSSEUS: I hope you did. That's the whole point of the operation, is"
1372,it not? Pretty lot of fools we'd look if we come here and nobody takes
1373,a damned bit of notice of us.

1400,"VICKI: Oh, it was nothing to do with me. "
1401,"TROILUS: Well, he thinks it was, and that's the main thing. He said"

1435,VICKI: I 
1436,"PRIAM: Oh, yes you did. I don't know how, but that's your own business,"
1437,"I suppose. Now, why on earth couldn't you tell us this was going to"
1438,"happen? You would have saved yourself all those hours in the cells, and"
1439,us a great deal of worry. 
1440,CASSANDRA: She didn't tell you because it's some form of treachery.
1441,"Don't trust her, father. "
1442,"PRIAM: Oh, stuff and nonsense. Oh, go and feed the sacred serpents or"

1451,"PARIS: Something uncommonly like it, anyway. "
1452,PRIAM: What on earth are you talking about?

1456,PARIS: Near the Grecian line. Look. You can just see it from here.

1458,of Asia. 
1459,CASSANDRA: It's an omen. An omen of disaster.

1462,"CASSANDRA: Yes, ask her! Go on, ask her! She knows what it is. It's our"
1463,"doom! It's the death of Troy, brought upon us by that cursed witch! "
1464,"PARIS: Now understand me, Cassandra. I will not have one word said"
1465,against that horse. 
1466,TROILUS: And neither will I against Cressida.

1478,PARIS: Why? That horse is in the image of one of our gods. 
1479,CASSANDRA: It's a trick. My dreams have always been right and they
1480,foretell disaster. 
1481,PARIS: Now were they right about that little temple? That has brought
1482,us nothing but good luck. 
1483,CASSANDRA: Good luck you call it. The whole family besotted by that
1484,sorceress. 
1485,"PRIAM: Oh, I do wish you'd stop calling Cressida that. And I would call"
1486,it luck to have the entire Greek army removed from our shores. Peace at
1487,last. Though the arrival of the horse is a little puzzling. 
1488,"PARIS: Well, Cressida probably arranged it, and the very sight of it"
1489,"just, just frightened the Greeks away. "

1491,"PARIS: Oh, she's probably down in the square watching them bring in the"

1553,he didn't delay like we asked? 
1554,VICKI: He must have a plan of escape to rescue us. Cyclops must have

1564,somewhere to hide around here.

1621,"ODYSSEUS: I was thinking, Doctor, that with any luck either Agamemnon"
1622,or Achilles will not come through. 
1623,DOCTOR: You mean they'll desert us? 
1624,"ODYSSEUS: No, die. Just a hope. One less finger in the pie. A greater"
1625,share of the booty for me. 
1626,DOCTOR: That is a most immoral way of looking at life. 
1627,ODYSSEUS: Nonsense. It's the reason that I've been here for ten long
1628,years fighting all the time. 
1629,"DOCTOR: Yes, well I must get out of here at once. "
1630,ODYSSEUS: You can't. 
1631,DOCTOR: I've only got to pull that lever and I can get back down into
1632,the square. 
1633,"ODYSSEUS: Yes, yes, but as I happen to be sitting on the rope you'll"
1634,fall forty feet and break your neck. 
1635,DOCTOR: I will not be party to your schemes. You forced me to invent
1636,this contraption. 
1637,"ODYSSEUS: I'm very glad I did, Doctor. Up to now it's been very"
1638,satisfactory. 
1639,DOCTOR: You had no right to bring me here at all. I'm utterly useless
1640,"to you. You must let me out of here. You're selfish, greedy, corrupt,"
1641,"cheap, horrible. Your one thought is for yourself and what you can get"
1642,out of it. 
1643,"ODYSSEUS: Be quiet, old man. "
1644,DOCTOR: I will not be quiet. You may stay here if you wish to have your
1645,"insignificant win, your victory or whatever you call it, but you must"
1646,let me out of here. 
1647,ODYSSEUS: One more word out of you and I shall kill you! You would be
1648,my first victim in Troy. 
1649,(The Doctor moves away from the hatch) 
1650,"ODYSSEUS: That's better. About now our ships should be returning, as"
1651,you planned.
1652,
1653,[Priam's palace]
1654,
1655,"(Inside the palace, Troilus visits Vicki.) "
1656,TROILUS: Cressida. 
1657,"VICKI: Oh, I'm so glad you've come. "
1658,TROILUS: I had to see you. 
1659,"VICKI: Troilus, dear Troilus, will you do something for me? "
1660,TROILUS: Anything. 
1661,VICKI: Leave the city. 
1662,TROILUS: Why? 
1663,VICKI: It's Diomede. 
1664,TROILUS: Diomede? 
1665,VICKI: I'm sure he's out on the plain. You've got to go and look for
1666,him and find him. If you bring him back you'll prove yourself the
1667,warrior you really are. He'll be your prisoner then as well as Paris'. 
1668,TROILUS: But he may have been rescued by the Greeks by now. 
1669,"VICKI: No, no, no. Paris said they'd all gone away and that was before"
1670,he even escaped. 
1671,"TROILUS: Why this concern for Diomede? Is he? Do you? I mean, are you"
1672,in love with him? 
1673,"VICKI: No, he's just a friend. "
1674,"TROILUS: Then if he's your friend, why do you want him captured? To be"
1675,a prisoner of war's considered very bad form. 
1676,"VICKI: But. Oh, why won't you see? Go out and search for him on the"
1677,plain. 
1678,"TROILUS: Cressida, I said I'd do anything for you, and a Trojan stands"
1679,"by his word, but please, why do you want me to leave the city and go"
1680,and search for a highly skilled Greek warrior. 
1681,VICKI: He isn't armed. I wouldn't send you out there if I thought
1682,anything could happen to you. I just want you to. I just want you to
1683,catch your own prisoner. 
1684,TROILUS: Did you mean that? About not wanting me hurt? 
1685,VICKI: Of course I did. I wouldn't ask you to do it otherwise. 
1686,"TROILUS: Oh, Cressida. "
1687,VICKI: You haven't got time. You've got to go now. 
1688,TROILUS: Don't worry. Everything's going to be all right.
1689,
1690,[Troy city square]
1691,
1692,(Night has fallen and the city of Troy is quiet. In
1693,"the main square, a rope descends from the belly of the immense wooden"
1694,"horse. One by one, the Greek soldiers drop to the ground. Eventually"
1695,"the Doctor climbs awkwardly down the rope, followed by Odysseus.) "
1696,"ODYSSEUS: This plan of yours, Doctor, is going to be a great success."
1697,Stay close to me.
1698,
1699,[Outside Troy]
1700,
1701,"(Outside the city walls, Troilus is searching for"
1702,Steven.) 
1703,TROILUS: Diomede! 
1704,(A figure emerges from behind some nearby rocks) 
1705,"TROILUS: Diomede, where are you! "
1706,"ACHILLES: What ails you, petty princeling? Lost some plaything? The one"
1707,you call for is long dead. 
1708,TROILUS: You're a Greek. I thought you'd sailed away. Who are you? 
1709,ACHILLES: You should not ask. My name is Achilles. 
1710,TROILUS: My brother's murderer. 
1711,"ACHILLES: So, Prince Troilus, is it? Well, I killed your brother"
1712,"fairly. Fought him man to man. Alas, I cannot do the same for you. This"
1713,will be the murder of a boy. 
1714,TROILUS: Has Cressida played me false? Very well. I'll fight my
1715,brother's murderer for I only live to kill Diomede. 
1716,"ACHILLES: Who is already dead. So follow him, Trojan! "
1717,"(Troilus and Achilles circle each other, battling furiously. The Greek"
1718,is surprised by Troilus' skill with a sword. He's beginning to tire
1719,when he slips on the rocky ground and falls. Troilus is quick to move
1720,in for the kill.) 
1721,TROILUS: So died my brother. The wheel has spun full circle. 
1722,"(But as Troilus strikes the death blow, Achilles brings up his own"
1723,sword and stabs at Troilus. Troilus collapses from his wound.) 
1724,"TROILUS: Diomede, I lived to call down wrath for love of Cressida."
1725,
1726,[Troy city square]
1727,
1728,(Two Greek soldiers struggle to unbolt the main
1729,"gates that seal the city of Troy. As the gates open, hoards of Greek"
1730,troops surge through the ever-widening gap.)
1731,
1732,[Priam's palace]
1733,
1734,"(In the palace, Priam listens to the carnage"
1735,outside with growing alarm.) 
1736,PRIAM: What noise was that? What are you doing? 
1737,PARIS: It's the Greeks! They were inside the horse and our gates are
1738,open to the enemy. 
1739,CASSANDRA: And none of you would listen to me! 
1740,(Odysseus bursts into the room.) 
1741,ODYSSEUS: Three hornets in their nest. Kill them! 
1742,(The soldiers run after Priam and his children.
1743,
1744,[Outside the Tardis]
1745,
1746,(The Doctor has made his way to the Tardis) 
1747,"VICKI: Doctor! Oh, Doctor! "
1748,"DOCTOR: Oh, my dear child! Oh, how lovely to see you. Where have you"
1749,been all this time? And where's Steven? 
1750,"VICKI: Doctor, he's over there, but I've got to talk to you. "
1751,"DOCTOR: Oh, now one thing at a time, child. Where's the young man? "
1752,"VICKI: Katarina. Katarina, this is the Doctor. Now, go and find the man"
1753,you call Diomede. He's hiding amongst those pillars over there. 
1754,KATARINA: You're from the other place? 
1755,DOCTOR: But who is this child. Now pull yourself together. We've got to
1756,go. 
1757,"VICKI: Katarina, go and find Diomede. He will be there. Bring him to my"
1758,"temple, quickly. "
1759,DOCTOR: We must all go and find him. Come along. 
1760,"VICKI: No, Doctor. Into the Tardis, quickly. "
1761,"DOCTOR: Listen, my dear child, the boy, the boy. "
1762,"VICKI: Open the door and listen to me, please. "
1763,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, but just be patient will you. "
1764,"VICKI: Steven is safe. Katarina will bring him. Come on, I've got to"
1765,talk to you. 
1766,[Troy city square]
1767,
1768,"KATARINA: Diomede, Cressida has sent me. "
1769,STEVEN: Who are you? 
1770,"KATARINA: I've come to take you to your temple. Oh, come, quickly. "
1771,STEVEN: I can't. 
1772,KATARINA: Lean on me. 
1773,(Katarina helps the weakened Steven back towards the Tardis.)
1774,
1775,[Priam's palace]
1776,
1777,"(Inside the palace, Priam and Paris lie dead."
1778,Odysseus has Cassandra by the shoulders and shakes her violently.) 
1779,"ODYSSEUS: Stop struggling, woman. You are reserved for Agamemnon and"
1780,he's welcome to you. 
1781,CASSANDRA: Tricksters! You Greeks will never learn to fight honestly! 
1782,ODYSSEUS: But we win! 
1783,CASSANDRA: Not for long. The day will come when you will perish as you
1784,made us do. 
1785,ODYSSEUS: Take her away. The high-born are reserved for Agamemnon. I
1786,can't wait to see him enjoy a talk with this one. 
1787,"CASSANDRA: Ten long years we fought you, Odysseus, and ten long years"
1788,it'll be before you see your home again. 
1789,ODYSSEUS: To Agamemnon with her. To his ship. A personal present from
1790,me. 
1791,CASSANDRA: Take your hands off me! Take your hands off me! 
1792,[Outside the Tardis]
1793,
1794,(The Doctor helps Katarina get Steven to the
1795,Tardis.) 
1796,"DOCTOR: You're sure it's just the shoulder? Right. Well, steady,"
1797,"steady. Hold tight. Hold on. Yes, careful. Just a minute. Careful,"
1798,"careful, Vicki. Oh, dear, dear. This business. There we are. Now, come"
1799,on bring him in. Bring him in there. Gently and carefully. That's it.
1800,That's it. Put him on the couch. 
1801,"ODYSSEUS: Stand still, old man, or you die. I claim your machine as"
1802,part of my share. 
1803,DOCTOR: Share of what? 
1804,ODYSSEUS: The spoils of war! 
1805,"DOCTOR: Now you stand back. I've gone far enough with you, my Lord"
1806,Odysseus. You go adventuring on your own. Be off with you. 
1807,"ODYSSEUS: Seize it! Come on, move! Quickly! A cart! "
1808,(The Tardis dematerialises) 
1809,ODYSSEUS: Doctor! 
1810,(Odysseus and his soldiers watch in awe as the Tardis dematerialises.) 
1811,"ODYSSEUS: Zeus! I wonder, were you really Zeus after all?"
1812,
1813,[Outside Troy]
1814,
1815,"TROILUS: Cressida, Cressida, could you have"
1816,betrayed us? Cressida! 
1817,(The distraught Troilus watches from the plain as the city burns.) 
1818,VICKI: I came to find you. 
1819,"TROILUS: Cressida, what are you doing here? Where's Diomede? "
1820,VICKI: He's gone with another friend that you never met. 
1821,TROILUS: Back to Greece. 
1822,"VICKI: No, to where I came from. You see, he wasn't really a Greek. He."
1823,"Oh, Troilus you're hurt! "
1824,TROILUS: Just a bit. 
1825,"VICKI: Oh, let me look. "
1826,"TROILUS: No, I'll be all right. Look, Cressida, I don't understand. "
1827,"VICKI: I, I don't suppose you ever will. That doesn't matter so long as"
1828,you trust me. 
1829,TROILUS: Trust you? After all 
1830,VICKI: I didn't betray you. That's why I stayed behind. I wanted you to
1831,know that I didn't. The main thing is I belong here now with you. If
1832,you'll have me. 
1833,"TROILUS: Cressida, look what's happened. "
1834,VICKI: There's only us now. 
1835,TROILUS: What do you mean? 
1836,VICKI: I'll explain someday. I'm sorry. 
1837,"TROILUS: But, but there's nowhere to go. "
1838,VICKI: We'll find somewhere. 
1839,"TROILUS: Oh, Cressida. Cressida, look! "
1840,VICKI: Be careful. They may be Greeks. 
1841,TROILUS: It's my cousin! 
1842,VICKI: Cousin? 
1843,"TROILUS: Yes, Aeneas. Oh, if only he'd come sooner. "
1844,VICKI: That's it. 
1845,TROILUS: What? 
1846,VICKI: He'll help us. 
1847,"TROILUS: But, there's, there's nothing left. "
1848,"VICKI: Yes, there is. There's us. We can start again. With your"
1849,"cousin's help we can, we can build another Troy."
1850,
1851,[Tardis]
1852,
1853,"(Inside the Tardis, Steven's condition worsening."
1854,"The Doctor mops his brow as Katarina stands by, watching helplessly.) "
1855,DOCTOR: That's not good. That's not good at all. We must get help. 
1856,KATARINA: What help is there in limbo? 
1857,"DOCTOR: What's that, my dear? "
1858,STEVEN: Vicki 
1859,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. Keep calm, keep calm. "
1860,STEVEN: Is she all right? 
1861,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes. She's all right. Yes, yes. "
1862,STEVEN: What's she doing over there? 
1863,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. That's not Vicki. That's not Vicki. Now keep calm. "
1864,STEVEN: Not Vicki? 
1865,DOCTOR: Be quiet! 
1866,STEVEN: Where is she? The Trojans will kill her. You came too soon. 
1867,DOCTOR: She's all right. She's all right. She wanted to stay. 
1868,"STEVEN: The Greeks. The Greeks, the Trojans. "
1869,DOCTOR: Keep still. 
1870,STEVEN: Vicki. 
1871,DOCTOR: She's all right. I know she is. She's gone to find Troilus and
1872,she'll be quite all right. This is just what she wanted. Now calm down.
1873,"Yes, quiet, quiet. "
1874,"STEVEN: Oh, Vicki. Vicki. "
1875,"DOCTOR: Oh, you'll have to look after that young man. I think he has"
1876,calmed down. 
1877,"KATARINA: Strange god, you bring me peace. "
1878,"DOCTOR: No, I don't know what Vicki has advised you, but "
1879,"KATARINA: Oh, the Priestess Cressida told me all would be well and I"
1880,knew it was to come. 
1881,DOCTOR: What was to come my dear? 
1882,KATARINA: That I was to die. 
1883,"DOCTOR: My dear child, you're not dead. That's nonsense. "
1884,KATARINA: This is not Troy. This is not even the world. This is the
1885,journey through the beyond. 
1886,"DOCTOR: Well, as you wish. "
1887,KATARINA: Thank you. 
1888,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, as you wish, my child. Now, I want you to keep"
1889,an eye on that young
1890,man. Will you? 
1891,"KATARINA: Yes, great god. "
1892,"DOCTOR: His name is Steven. And remember Katarina, you must call me"
1893,Doctor. 
1894,"KATARINA: Oh, as you wish Doc. "
1895,"DOCTOR: I'm not a Doc. I am not a god. Oh, my dear Vicki, I hope you'll"
1896,"be all right. I shall miss you child. Oh, yes, now. Those drugs, those"
1897,"drugs. What am I going to do? I must stop somewhere. But, how? I've got"
1898,to! Yes! I must! I must!
