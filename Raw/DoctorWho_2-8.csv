18,[Control room] 
19, DALEK 1: Our greatest enemies have left the planet
20,Xeros. They are once again in time and space. 
21,DALEK 2 : They cannot escape! Our time machine will soon follow
22,them. They will be exterminated! Exterminated! Exterminated!

26,(The Doctor is working on a large circular device
27,with a television screen in the middle) 
28,"DOCTOR: Don't whistle, dear, please. "
29,"VICKI: Well, have you nearly finished, Doctor? "
30,(The Doctor's reply is rendered unintelligible by the screwdriver in
31,his mouth. Vicki whistles again.) 
32,DOCTOR: Stop whistling! 
33,"VICKI: Well, can I do anything to help? "
34,"DOCTOR: (mumble) Buzz off, now."
35,
36, [Tardis living area]
37,
38, (Ian is reading Monsters from Outer Space) 
39,VICKI: What are you reading? 
40,(He shows her the title) 
41,VICKI: Is it good? 
42,IAN: Yes. A bit far-fetched. 
43,"(Vicki starts reading it over his shoulder, then leans on him to see"
44,better. He moves) 
45,"VICKI: Oh, all right."
46,
47, [Women's bedroom]
48,
49, VICKI: I am redundant around here. 
50,"BARBARA: Oh, nonsense. Come and sit down and talk to me. "
51,VICKI: I am a useless person. 
52,(Vicki sits on the edge of a 'bed' which then tips her forward making
53,her knock over whatever Barbara was using)
54,"BARBARA: Oh, Vicki! "
55,"VICKI: Oh, what was it? "
56,"BARBARA: Oh, it was a dress for you."
57,
58,[Tardis]
59,
60,"(There's a very loud, skull-penetrating noise"
61,coming from the device) 
62,IAN: What's the matter? What's the trouble? 
63,DOCTOR: Out of the way! Out of the way! 
64,IAN: What's the matter? 
65,BARBARA: Doctor! Turn it off! 
66,(The Doctor finds the volume control) 
67,"BARBARA: Oh, that's better. "
68,IAN: Are you trying to deafen us all or something? 
69,"DOCTOR: Deafen you? No, no, dear boy. It was an unfortunate"
70,juxtaposition of the sonic rectifier with the lineal amplifier. 
71,"IAN: Oh, of course. I should have know. "
72,"BARBARA: Doctor, what is this machine? "
73,"DOCTOR: I've already told you, my dear. It's a Time and Space"
74,Visualiser. 
75,"BARBARA: Yes, but apart from making that dreadful noise, what does it"
76,do? 
77,DOCTOR: It converts neutrons of light energy into electrical impulses. 
78,"IAN: Oh, wonderful. I've always wanted one. "
79,"DOCTOR: Do I detect a hint of sarcasm, dear boy? "
80,"IAN: I'm sorry, Doctor, but you rattle off explanations that would have"
81,baffled Einstein and you expect Barbara and I to know what you're
82,talking about. 
83,"DOCTOR: Very well then, I shall quote you Ven Der Haff's law. Mass is"
84,"absorbed by light, therefore light has mass and energy. "
85,VICKI: The energy radiated by a light neutron is equal to the energy of
86,the mass it absorbed. 
87,"DOCTOR: Splendid child, splendid. "
88,VICKI: It's quite simple. It just means that anything that ever
89,"happens, anywhere in the universe, is recorded in light neutrons. "
90,"DOCTOR: I couldn't have put it better myself, child. "
91,"VICKI: Doctor, you know when I left Earth? Scientists were trying to"
92,invent a machine that would convert the energy from light neutrons into
93,electrical impulses. That meant that you could just tune in and see any
94,event in history. 
95,BARBARA: Do you mean a sort of Time television? 
96,"VICKI: Yes, like that. "
97,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what this is. "
98,BARBARA + VICKI: No! 
99,"VICKI: Doctor, you're kidding! Why didn't you tell me? I could have"
100,fixed it for you instead of you fiddling about like that. 
101,"DOCTOR: I have already fixed it, my dear. My dear Chesterton, do you"
102,mind if I distract you from your cowboys and indians? 
103,"IAN: Oh, all right. "
104,DOCTOR: I want to give a little demonstration. Will you think of an
105,event in history? 
106,"IAN: All right, I've thought of one. "
107,"DOCTOR: Well, first the place. "
108,"IAN: Oh, Earth, that's easy. "
109,"DOCTOR: Now the geographical location, date and time. "
110,"IAN: Nineteenth of November, 1863. The place, Pennsylvania, USA. "
111,DOCTOR: Good! Don't go away. 
112,(The noise starts up again and has to be turned down) 
113,DOCTOR: Watch. 
114,(An image appears on the small screen of a bearded man speaking quite
115,clearly and carefully in an American accent) 
116,"LINCOLN : conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the"
117,proposition that all men are created equal. 
118,BARBARA: Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln! 
119,"IAN: Yes, that's what I asked for. The Gettysburg address! "
120,"LINCOLN : Civil war, testing whether that nation, or any"
121,"nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a"
122,great battlefield of that war. We've come to dedicate a portion of it
123,as a final resting place for those who gave their lives that that
124,nation might live. That is altogether fitting and proper that we should
125,"do so. But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate,"
126,we cannot hallow this ground. 
127,"BARBARA: Doctor, can I have a go? "
128,VICKI: Can I? Can I? Please? 
129,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, yes, now, all in good time, my dear, all in good"
130,"time. Now, Barbara. "
131,BARBARA: Yes? Now 
132,IAN: Did you ever see anything like it in your life? 
133,VICKI: No. 
134,"IAN: Well, that was Abraham Lincoln. "
135,"BARBARA: Quiet, you lot! "
136,VICKI: I know it was! 
137,"IAN: Well, where are we? "
138,VICKI: What is it! 
139,DOCTOR: Put it in there. In the slot. Now. 
140,(A regal lady in a Tudor ruff is speaking) 
141,QUEEN : We are well aware of what 
142,IAN: It's Queen Elizabeth the first. 
143,DOCTOR: Shh! 
144,VICKI: Who's that man? 
145,"BARBARA: Oh, wait and see. "
146, [Palace] 
147, (A man is hiding behind a tapestry) 
148,"SHAKESPEARE: Is the Queen angry, sire? It was only a jest. "
149,BACON: She has graciously granted you an audience. 
150,"SHAKESPEARE: Oh. (goes forward and kneels) Oh, your Majesty! "
151,"QUEEN: Master Shakespeare, you aware of the concern your character of"
152,Falstaff has caused to Sir John Oldcastle? 
153,BACON: It was so obviously he. 
154,"SHAKESPEARE: Yes, well. I can explain, your Majesty. "
155,QUEEN: You admit it then. 
156,"SHAKESPEARE: Yes, your Majesty. "
157,QUEEN: Good. Give it no more thought. We found it very amusing. Tell
158,"me, have any plans to write a further play on him? "
159,SHAKESPEARE: No. 
160,QUEEN: Oh. 
161,"SHAKESPEARE: No, I haven't, your Majesty. "
162, [Tardis] 
163, QUEEN : That's a pity. But it does not
164,matter. We have idea which may be of service. You shall write a play of
165,Falstaff in love. 
166, [Palace] 
167, QUEEN: Does that not fire your imagination? 
168,"SHAKESPEARE: Oh, a happy idea, your Majesty. Yes. "
169,"QUEEN: Away with you, Will. To your pen. "
170,(back behind the tapestry) 
171,BACON: I also have an idea that you may wish to use. The history of
172,"Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. "
173,"SHAKESPEARE: I'm afraid not, sire. "
174,"BACON: Oh, do you know the story then? "
175,"SHAKESPEARE: I assure you, my lord, it would not be quite in my style. "
176,"BACON: Very well then, scribbler. "
177,"SHAKESPEARE: Hamlet, Prince of Denmark? "
178, [Tardis] 
179," IAN: Well, Barbara, did you find out what you"
180,wanted to know? 
181,BARBARA: I didn't really want to know anything. I just wanted to see
182,Elizabeth's court. Did you see the way Shakespeare looked when he
183,thought of Hamlet? 
184,"IAN: Yes, I did. I "
185,(Vicki puts in her selection) 
186,"IAN: Well, where are we now? "
187,VICKI: Shh. 
188,ANNOUNCER : This is BBC One. The next programme is due to start in
189,just under one minute. 
190,"BARBARA: Vicki, what year have you got on there? "
191,VICKI: 1965. 
192,"DOCTOR: Come along, come. "
193,IAN: You've got a television. 
194,VICKI: Shh! 
195,IAN: showing 
196,VICKI: I want to watch it. 
197,HOST : Here singing their latest number one hit it's the
198,fabulous wait for it. It's the fabulous Beatles! 
199,VICKI: Yes! Fabulous! 
200,"BEATLES: I think I'm gonna be sad, I think it's today, yeah! The girl"
201,"that's driving me mad, Is going away. "
202,"She's gotta ticket to ride, She's gotta ticket to ride. She's gotta"
203,"ticket to ride, and she don't care. My baby don't care. "
204,(Everyone is bopping and singing along until Barbara leans on the
205,volume and they loose the picture) 
206,"IAN: Oh, Barbara. "
207,DOCTOR: Now you've squashed my favourite Beatles! 
208,"IAN: Vicki, I had no idea you knew about the Beatles. "
209,VICKI: Of course I know about them. I've been to their Memorial Theatre
210,in Liverpool. 
211,"BARBARA: Well, what do you think of them, Vicki? "
212,"VICKI: Well, they're marvellous, but I didn't know they played"
213,classical music! 
214,BARBARA: Classical music? 
215,"IAN: Get with it, Barbara. Get with it. Styles change, styles change. "
216,"DOCTOR: I think you'd better turn it off, my dear. Yes, we're about to"
217,materialise. 
218,(The Tardis materialises in an apparently empty expanse) 
219,"DOCTOR: Well, everything appears to be all right. Yes. The oxygen's"
220,high and the gravity is a little greater than Earth.
221,
222, [Outside the Tardis]
223,
224," BARBARA: Oh, it's hot. "
225,"DOCTOR: Well, it's no small wonder. Look up there, my dear. Look. Two"
226,suns moving very quickly. I expect the days and nights are very short
227,here. 
228,VICKI: Are we going to explore now then? 
229,BARBARA: I shouldn't think there is anything to explore. Just miles and
230,miles of sand. And those strange things. 
231,(sculptures against the horizon) 
232,VICKI: You never know. Over that sand-dune there might be a city or a
233,space-station or anything. 
234,"DOCTOR: The child's just like me, you know. Always wants to know what's"
235,on t'other side of the hill. 
236,VICKI: I'm gonna find out too! 
237,"BARBARA: Vicki, come back. "
238,IAN: I'd better follow her. 
239,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, Chesterton, here, here. "
240,IAN: What? 
241,"DOCTOR: Look here, you'd better take this Tardis magnet with you. Watch"
242,"that little green light in there. Don't drop it, otherwise you'll get"
243,lost. 
244,BARBARA: Ian! 
245,"IAN: All right, I'm coming. We won't go any further than the ridge. "
246,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes. "
247,BARBARA: Look at her. 
248,IAN: Don't worry. I'll look after her. 
249,VICKI: Come on! 
250,"IAN: All right, Christopher Columbus! Hang on. "
251, (Dune] 
252, VICKI: Come on. 
253,"IAN: Yes, over there. "
254,VICKI: Look at this thing. 
255,"IAN: What is it? It looks like a man, doesn't it? "
256,VICKI: Yes. but of frozen seaweed. Funny shape. 
257,IAN: Funny smell. 
258,"(At the top of the ridge, Vicki's foot slips on something.) "
259,VICKI: Oh! Ian. Ian! Come and look at this. 
260,IAN: Hey. You know this gadget of the Doctor's? It really works. 
261,VICKI: Never mind that. Look at this. 
262,IAN: What? What is it? 
263,VICKI: I don't know. 
264,"IAN: Pooh! What an awful smell. Well, at least it's not a pool of acid."
265,
266,"VICKI: That makes a change. Look, there's more of it. "
267,IAN: Yeah. 
268,VICKI: It's a trail. 
269,IAN: Probably blood. 
270,"VICKI: Oh yes, it's bound to be. Come on, let's see where it leads. "
271,"IAN: All right. It is ingenious, this. "
272,"(After they leave, a long tentacle lifts itself out of the sand) "
273, [Outside the Tardis] 
274, (The Doctor and Barbara are sunbathing fully
275,clothed on blankets. The Doctor starts singing) 
276,BARBARA: What's that awful noise? 
277,DOCTOR: I beg your pardon? awful noise? That's no way to talk about my
278,singing! 
279,"BARBARA: No, Doctor, not that awful noise, the other one. Listen to it!"
280,
281,(It's a high pitched whine) 
282,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, it sounds like the Visualiser. I think it's still"
283,"on. Yes, would you mind going in and switching it off for me, dear? "
284,BARBARA: Okay. I've had enough sun anyway. 
285,"DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. "
286,(Barbara leaves) 
287,"DOCTOR: Oh, awful noise, indeed. Ha! I can charm the nightingales out"
288,of the trees.
289,
290, [Tardis]
291,
292,"(Barbara tries to turn off the visualiser, but gets"
293,a signal instead) 
294,DALEK : The Supreme Dalek is ready to receive your report! 
295,DALEK : The report is ready. 
296,"BARBARA: Doctor! Doctor, come quickly! "
297,"DOCTOR : Yes, all right, my dear, all right, all right. What is it"
298,"now? Gracious me, can't I even relax for five "
299,(The Doctor enters) 
300,DOCTOR: The Daleks! 
301, [Control room] 
302, BLACK: Give your report. 
303,DALEK: Our time machine has been completed. 
304,BLACK: The operation will proceed at once. The movement scanners have
305,"located the enemy time machine, Tardis. "
306,DALEKS: Tardis! Tardis! Tardis! Tardis! Tardis! 
307, [Tardis] 
308," BARBARA: Doctor, he said the Tardis. And look, on"
309,"their screen, that's us. "
310,"DOCTOR: What is more important, he referred to the Tardis as the enemy"
311,time machine. 
312, [Control room] 
313, BLACK: At present it lies in the Segaro desert of
314,the planet Aridius. 
315,DALEK: We await command. 
316,BLACK: The Doctor and the three humans delayed our conquest of Earth. 
317,DALEK 2: Daleks cannot be defeated! 
318,DALEK: To defy Daleks is death! 
319,DALEK 1: They will pay for their crime! 
320,BLACK: Annihilate! 
321,DALEKS: Annihilate! Annihilate! Annihilate! Annihilate! Annihilate! 
322,BLACK: The assassination group will embark at once in our time machine.
323,They pursue the humans through all eternity. They must be destroyed!
324,Exterminate them! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! 
325,(Six Daleks trundle into their time machine like cars going into a
326,"fairground ghost ride, then it dematerialises) "
327, [Tardis] 
328, (The Doctor turns off the Visualiser) 
329,DOCTOR: My machine can only pick up the things that happened in the
330,past. 
331,BARBARA: Then they're on their way here. 
332,"DOCTOR: Or worse, already here. You heard their orders. We are to be"
333,exterminated! 
334,"BARBARA: But Doctor, can't we get away from them? "
335,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, yes, but Ian and the child. Come on, we have"
336,such little time.
337,
338,[Dunes] 
339,(they crest the dune) 
340,"VICKI: Oh, come on, keep going. "
341,"IAN: What do you think I am? One of these funny things? Yes, well, no"
342,"space city, Vicki. "
343,VICKI: (unintelligible on the location film) 
344,"(further on, back in the studio, they stop and sit) "
345,VICKI: The trail just ends. 
346,"IAN: Well, we're a long way from the Tardis now, Vicki. "
347,VICKI: Yeah. 
348,"IAN: We ought to get back really, you know. "
349,VICKI: Yeah. 
350,IAN: They'll be missing us. 
351,"VICKI: If you look at the sun through your fingers, you have twenty"
352,instead of ten. 
353,"IAN: Yes. Oh, I could do with a drink. "
354,"VICKI: Oh yes. We should get back, you know. "
355,"IAN: Yeah. Soon be dark, you know. Look at those suns. Just like the"
356,"Doctor said. They move fast. Hard, this ground, isn't it? Like glass. "
357,"VICKI: Come on, Ian. Let's go. "
358,"IAN: Yeah, all right. Hello, what's this? "
359,(He brushes the sand away) 
360,IAN: A ring. A ring in the sand. 
361,VICKI: No! No! The ring in the field! 
362,IAN: What? What are you talking about? What's the matter? 
363,(Vicki's started laughing) 
364,"VICKI: Well, you see, when I was very young. "
365,IAN: Yes? 
366,"VICKI: Near where I lived there was a field, and in this field there"
367,"was a ring, just like that, sticking out of the ground. You see, the"
368,"point was, on the other side of the hedge, there was a castle, an"
369,"enormous thing, with a drawbridge. "
370,(It has gone dark now) 
371,VICKI: And 
372,"IAN: Well, go on. "
373,"VICKI: We had this thing, that if we pulled that ring "
374,IAN: Yes? 
375,VICKI: The drawbridge would come down and something awful would come
376,out. 
377,"IAN: Oh, Vicki, look around you. Can you see a castle anywhere? "
378,"VICKI: No, but for heavens sake, something's going to happen if we pull"
379,that thing. 
380,"IAN: Well, shall I pull it or shan't I? "
381,"VICKI: Yes, all right, go on. "
382,IAN: I think I'll move it now. 
383,VICKI: Try turning it. 
384,"IAN: No, won't turn. Hold on. "
385,(It suddenly comes away and he tumbles backwards) 
386,"IAN: Ah, Excalibur! (throws it away) Come on. No castles, no"
387,drawbridges. Back we go. 
388,(There's a creaking sound and they run back to see a trapdoor has
389,opened. Vicki starts to go down the steps.) 
390,"IAN: Vicki, just check it, eh? "
391,VICKI: Yes. Steps. 
392,(Meanwhile) 
393,BARBARA: Vicki! Ian! Nothing. 
394,DOCTOR: The wretched wind has wiped out all their tracks. It's so cold
395,here. 
396,"BARBARA: Yeah, come on Doctor, let's go back to the Tardis. "
397,"DOCTOR: Ah, this way, dear. "
398,"BARBARA: No, no, no, it's that way. I remember. "
399,"DOCTOR: I have the directional instincts of a homing pigeon. Now, come"
400,along. Follow me.
401,
402, [Underground]
403,
404, IAN: Hello! 
405,(There's a late echo. It's dark and Ian almost misses his footing) 
406,"VICKI: Oh! Oh, Ian, stay over here by this wall. "
407,(A tentacle closes the trapdoor. They can just make out the blobby
408,shape in the dark)
409,
410,[Planet surface]
411,
412,(A sandstorm is raging) 
413,"(The Doctor points one way, but Barbara spots it in another direction."
414,They collapse under the onslaught of the wind) 
415,"(Next morning, they lift their heads to see) "
416,BARBARA: It's changed. The whole landscape's changed! The Tardis has
417,gone. There's no sign of it! 
418,DOCTOR: It's probably got buried in that sandstorm. 
419,BARBARA: But where? All these stretches of sand look exactly alike. 
420,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, wait a minute, wait a minute. I've got an idea."
421,"Let's have a look at the Tardis magnet. Oh, I'm sorry, I just"
422,"remembered I gave it to Ian. Well, come on, come on. We can't waste"
423,time. Let's get going. That sun'll be up in a minute and we've no food
424,"and there's no water, no shade. Get down! Get down! "
425,BARBARA: Oh! What's the matter? 
426,"(A Dalek rises from the sand, grumbling to itself)"

428, Episode Two - The
429,Death of Time
430,
431,[Planet surface]
432,
433, DOCTOR: Keep your head down. They haven't seen us
434,yet. 
435,"BARBARA: Doctor, look! There's more of them. "
436,DALEK 2: The enemy time machine is in this area. 
437,DALEK 1: We can locate the position with our seismic detectors. 
438,DALEK 2: Find and destroy it. The remainder will search for the humans.
439,
440,DALEK 1: Are they to be taken alive? 
441,DALEK 2: No. They are to be exterminated. 
442,DALEK 1: Good. 
443,DALEK 2: Destroyed. 
444,DALEK 1: Exterminated. 
445,"DALEK 2: Now, let the search begin. "
446,DOCTOR: Stay down. One of them's coming this way. (they duck down) We
447,must find the Tardis before they do. 
448,"BARBARA: Yes, and we must warn Ian and Vicki. They don't even know the"
449,Daleks are here. 
450,DOCTOR: Yes. Warn them? But how? We haven't seen them for hours.
451,"Anyway, it's no good hanging about here. Come on, let's get moving,"
452,come on.
453,(The Doctor and Barbara are confronted by reptile-like bipeds)
454,
455,[Chamber]
456,
457,(Vicki screams) 
458,"IAN: Don't just stand there and scream, you little fool. Run!"
459,
460,[Tunnel]
461,
462,(But there's another one in their path) 
463,"VICKI: Oh, don't just standing there gaping, you nit! Come on, back! "
464,(Ian throws a rock at it)

475,"MALSAN: (to Barbara) This desert was once a vast ocean. We, the"
476,"Aridians, lived in a city beneath the sea, but for a thousand years"
477,"those twin suns that burn, have moved closer and closer. "
478,"RYNIAN: (to the Doctor) Then, then the seas dried up and all the"
479,creatures that lived within their waters perished. 
480,"(Everyone, say Hi! to Hywel Bennett) "
481,MALSAN: All but the Mire Beasts. 
482,BARBARA: Mire Beasts? What are they? 
483,"MALSAN: They lived in the slime, at the bottom of the ocean. When the"
484,waters were gone they invaded our cities. 
485,RYNIAN: There were too many of them. We tried to destroy them. They
486,multiplied too quickly for us. We were driven back as the Mire Beasts
487,took over more and more of our beautiful city. 
488,"DOCTOR: These Mire Beasts, what do they feed on? "
489,MALSAN: They are flesh eaters. 
490,DOCTOR: You mean they attack humans? 
491,MALSAN: Of course. 
492,"DOCTOR: Oh, good gracious. "

499,"DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think they can travel far in this sand. "
500,"MALSAN: Then they might have gone through the Taltarian air-lock, into"
501,the tunnels. 
502,RYNIAN: Then it is too late. 
503,"BARBARA: What do you mean, it's too late? "
504,RYNIAN: It is to be exploded. 
505,DOCTOR: Exploded? 
506,"RYNIAN: Yes, the air-lock. You see, we Aridians have learned the only"
507,way to destroy the Mire Beast is to entomb them in the sections of the
508,city they have occupied. 
509,MALSAN: The Taltarian air-lock will be detonated at high suns. 
510,"BARBARA: Well then, we must stop it! "

589,their advance. Do please sit down. I have some news for you. 
590,"DOCTOR: Now, what is it? "
591,MALSAN: The leader of the Daleks has communicated with us. They have
592,issued an ultimatum.

928,"MORTON: 1966 Ma'am. Say, you wouldn't be trying to have a bit of fun"
929,"with me now, would you? "
930,"BARBARA: No, no. "
931,VICKI: Afternoon. 
932,MORTON: Mornin'. 1966. 
933,"VICKI: Oh, er, thank you. "
934,"MORTON: Pleased to oblige you, Miss! "
935,VICKI: I recognise this place. It's Ancient New York. 
936,MORTON: Ancient? 
937,VICKI: There were pictures of it in our history books. It was destroyed
938,in the Dalek invasion. 
939,"MORTON: Wait, how many more of you are there in that thing? "
940,"DOCTOR: Oh, just the four of us, young man. "
941,MORTON: Must be a kind of tight squeeze. They can't all have come out
942,of there. 
943,IAN: Doctor? This is no place to meet the Daleks. A lot of innocent
944,people could get hurt. 
945,"DOCTOR: Yes, quite so, quite so, dear boy. Well, the computers will be"
946,ready in a few moments. I suggest that we re-embark. 
947,IAN: Yes. 
948,"DOCTOR: Vicki, Barbara, come along. "
949,"MORTON: Hey, you goin' back in? "
950,"BARBARA: Yes, that's right. "
951,"MORTON: Oh now, come on, wait a minute. I just bet you folks are from"
952,"Hollywood. You're making some kind of motion picture. Now that's it,"
953,ain't it? 
954,"DOCTOR: No, it ain't! I mean, it isn't. "
955,"MORTON: Come on, you can tell me. Your secret will be safe. Yes, sir,"
956,real safe. 
957,DOCTOR: Secret? 
958,"MORTON: Sure, I've seen this trick before. Great long police cars"
959,comin' outa tiny little wooden sheds. I saw you come outa there with ma
960,own eyes! You just ain't gonna make it back it again. 
961,VICKI: Goodbye. 
962,BARBARA: Goodbye! 
963,IAN: Goodbye! 
964,(Morton slaps the Doctor on the back) 
965,MORTON: Hot diggety! I knew I was right. You should be wearing Police
966,"uniforms, you all is, you all is in a chase. "
967,"DOCTOR: Chase? Yes, as a matter of fact, young man, that's exactly what"
968,"this is. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must be getting along. It's the"
969,"chase, you know? "
970,"MORTON: Sure thing, Mister! I understand. Just wait til I tell the"
971,folks back home I met some real live movie pe (knocks on Tardis door)
972,"Do you know Cheyenne Bodie? Look, just wait a minute, I want to get"
973,this thing on celluloid. 
974,(The Tardis dematerialises) 
975,"MORTON: That's real clever, how they done that. Sure if it don't beat"
976,all. 
977,(The Dalek's ship materialise) 
978,MORTON: Sure is clever. Gol darn it if they ain't gone and done it
979,again. 
980,(A Dalek comes out) 
981,"MORTON: Howdy, Mister! Say, you sure are an ugly looking friend. Wait,"
982,"what's the name of this film, Mister? My, my, boy, you've come all over"
983,in blue spots. What's this thing here? 
984,(He grabs the Dalek's ray gun and gets pushed against the wire mesh for
985,his troubles) 
986,"MORTON: Now, just, now now! There ain't no need to get sore. The other"
987,movie people was right friendly. 
988,DALEK: Movie pe? Where are they? 
989,MORTON: They just left. They was in some kind of beat-up old blue
990,"wooden box. It just kinda like vanished. Say, I thought they'd have"
991,"been chasing you. Just hold it there, Mister. I want to get a picture"
992,of this. 
993,(The Dalek ship dematerialises) 
994,MORTON: Sure is the greatest 
995,(But he's missed the shot again) 
996,"MORTON: Well, dang me if they ain't gone and done it again. This is the"
997,greatest thing. It's gotta be around here somewhere. Just can't vanish
998,"into thin air. I know you're there somewhere, boy. "
999,(Morton starts feeling the air and stamping on the floor as the group
1000,returns)

1002,get around 
1003,"MORTON: There's gotta be a trick to it somehow! Yes, sir, I bet this"
1004,here's hollow. That's what it is. 
1005,GUIDE: He's a nutter. Keep an eye on him. See that he don't jump off
1006,the building. I'll get a cop. Watch him. 
1007,MORTON: Coming back. They should

1012,VICKI: They're still on our track. 
1013,"DOCTOR: Catching us up, are they? Will you get my screwdriver, child?"
1014,The large one. The one that I was fiddling with on the Visualiser. 
1015,VICKI: Okay. 
1016,(Ian and Barbara carry a piece of equipment in) 
1017,"BARBARA: Oh, this thing's heavy. "
1018,"DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, thank you. "
1019,"IAN: Is this going to work, Doctor? "
1020,"DOCTOR: Maybe, I'm not sure. But if they're going to catch us up, we've"
1021,got to find something to fight back with. 
1022,"BARBARA: Oh, Doctor, why don't we just stay where we are? "
1023,"DOCTOR: That's out of the question, my dear. The vacuum in space, we"
1024,should all be dead in no time. 
1025,VICKI: Here you are. 
1026,"DOCTOR: Ah, thank you, thank you. "
1027,VICKI: What's this all about? 
1028,"DOCTOR: Well, the idea is, my dear, is to find something that we can"
1029,fight back with. 
1030,"BARBARA: Doctor, we're landing! "
1031,"DOCTOR: But I'm not ready! I'm not ready! We can't meet them now! Oh,"
1032,"good gracious! No, wait a minute. We shall have to land and then take"
1033,off as quickly as we can again.

1059,dealing with stowaways. 
1060,BARBARA: I am not a stowaway and you're hurting my hands! 
1061,RICHARDSON: Just you keep still. Where've you been hiding since we set

1177,"BARBARA: Well, you must admit it was funny. "
1178,"IAN: Really? I haven't seen the joke yet, I must say. One thing I did"
1179,"see, by the way. The name of that ship we were on. "
1180,BARBARA: Was what that? 
1181,IAN: The Mary Celeste. 
1182,BARBARA: Mary Celeste? 
1183,"IAN: Vicki? Any change, Doctor? "
1184,"DOCTOR: I altered the curve we were travelling on. For one moment, I"
1185,dared hoped we'd lost them. They must have detected the change and
1186,followed. They're close on our track. 
1187,IAN: But surely we've got our twelve minute lead still? 
1188,DOCTOR: I'm afraid not. It's down to eight. It will be reduced even
1189,further after our next landing. We must face the facts. The Daleks are

1200,"IAN: I don't know. Ideal place to fight Daleks, you know. Good stout"
1201,"walls, an upper storey, stairs. Daleks don't like stairs. "
1202,(Ian steps on a stair and it creaks. A bat flies at Barbara.) 
1203,BARBARA: Argh! Look out! 
1204,"VICKI: Probably vampires, if you ask me. "
1205,"IAN: Oh, charming. "
1206,"DOCTOR: Oh, rubbish my child. Vampire bats are only to be found in"
1207,South America. 
1208,VICKI: Maybe that's where we are. 
1209,"DOCTOR: No, I don't think so. Judging by the architecture, I should say"
1210,Central Europe. 
1211,"VICKI: Well, I'm with Barbara. I don't like it here. I think we should"
1212,go. 
1213,"DOCTOR: Yes, in the normal progress of time, my dear, I would say, I"
1214,"would agree with you, but unfortunately we've got to face the Daleks"
1215,and I think it's essential we take a look around. Let's try upstairs. 
1216,(A creak of a stair and a loud sound of bat wings) 
1217,"BARBARA: Well, you got if you want to, but I'm staying near the Tardis."
1218,
1219,VICKI: Me too. 
1220,"DOCTOR: Oh, very well, stay where you are. We shan't be long. "
1221,IAN: Shan't be long. 
1222,"BARBARA: Well, Vicki, there's really nothing to be scared of. This is"
1223,just an old house. We mustn't let our imaginations run away with us. 
1224,(Thunder) 
1225,"VICKI: No, you're quite right. We mustn't behave like children. "
1226,"BARBARA: No, we mustn't. Now come on, let's help the Doctor and look"
1227,around down here. How about the fireplace? 
1228,(The mantle is carved to make it look like an open mouth. When they get
1229,close two stones revolve to look like eyes. They sidle away and find a
1230,wooden case.) 
1231,VICKI: Look at that. What do you suppose is inside it? 
1232,(Barbara goes to open it and there is maniacal laughter. She gets the
1233,lid open and it is empty. They laugh with relief. Barbara closes the
1234,lid and a skeleton drops down in front of them. Screams!)

1246,"IAN: Doctor, I think we'd better check on Barbara and Vicki. "
1247,"DOCTOR: Oh, nonsense. We've only just left them, dear boy. Now, I must"
1248,see what's on that table. 
1249,IAN: Must you? I'd really rather not know. 
1250,"DOCTOR: You don't mean that, do you? Where's your spirit of adventure? "
1251,IAN: It died a slow and painful death when those bats came out of the
1252,rafters.

1298,"and weird, but it is familiar. "
1299,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's the word, dear boy, familiar. You know, when I was"
1300,"coming down those stairs, I knew that thing was going to move. I knew"
1301,it.

1311,DOCTOR: This house is exactly what you would expect in a nightmare.
1312,"Yes, we're in a world of dreams. Creaking doors, thunder and lightning,"
1313,monsters and all the things that go bumpety bumpety in the night. 
1314,"IAN: With one vital difference, Doctor. This house is real. It exists. "
1315,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes it exists in the dark recesses of the human minds."

1319,IAN: Then we're safe. 
1320,"DOCTOR: Safe? What on earth do you mean, dear boy? "

1349," IAN: Where are those girls, Doctor? Well, we would"
1350,have seen them if they were upstairs. Hadn't we better take another
1351,look down there? 
1352,DOCTOR: Had we? 
1353,IAN: Afraid so. 
1354,"DOCTOR: Well, after you, dear boy. "

1376,DOCTOR: Where have you both been? 
1377,VICKI: We climbed through a secret tunnel straight down 
1378,IAN: There's no time to tell us now. The Daleks are here. 
1379,BARBARA: Daleks? 
1380,IAN: Yes. 
1381,VICKI: Look out!

1404,
1405, IAN: This game of hide and seek through time is
1406,wearing a little thin now. 
1407,DOCTOR: Game? 
1408,IAN: What an extraordinary place? More spooks to the square mile than
1409,the Tower of London. You know that theory of yours 
1410,"DOCTOR: Theory, my dear boy? Fact. I am convinced that that house was"
1411,neither time nor space. We were lodged for a period in an area of human
1412,thought. 
1413,IAN: And were the Daleks lodging too? 
1414,"DOCTOR: Oh, I don't want to enter into it. A discussion with him! Oh! "
1415,IAN: Have it your own way. I think there's a much simpler explanation.

1420,"DOCTOR: Oh, necessarily crude, dear boy. I haven't time to perfect"
1421,anything. 
1422,"IAN: When's it going to be operational, eh? "
1423,DOCTOR: You know just as much about that as I do. 
1424,"IAN: Oh Doctor, we can't go on like this, can we? We've given them the"
1425,slip once or twice but sooner or later we're going to have to settle
1426,with them. 
1427,"DOCTOR: Oh, I quite agree with you. Running away won't solve our"
1428,problem. But as soon as we've reached the final decision to stand and
1429,"fight, there'll be no turning back. It'll either be them or us. Hmm? "
1430,BARBARA: Here we are.

1454,"DALEK 4: Their leader, the one they call Doctor. Is the reproducer"
1455,programmed? 
1456,DALEK 3: All is in readiness. Photo images and relevant data are in the

1471,
1472, DOCTOR: It's my fault. All my own stupid fault. I
1473,shouldn't have moved the Tardis. I have should have checked up first to
1474,make sure that everybody was inside. I shall never forgive myself. 
1475,"IAN: Oh, no Doctor, don't blame yourself. We're all equally to blame. I"
1476,was convinced she was on board. 
1477,BARBARA: Isn't there anything we can do? Is there no way of going back
1478,for Vicki? 
1479,"DOCTOR: You don't think I'd be standing here doing nothing do you, if"
1480,"there were? We're helpless, and you of all people should know that the"
1481,Tardis can't land in the same time and place twice! 
1482,IAN: We've never stayed long enough in any one place to repair the time
1483,"mechanism of the Tardis. If we did, is there a chance of going back for"
1484,Vicki? 
1485,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course, it's possible, but it might take months, even"
1486,years. 
1487,"BARBARA: But Doctor, if we all worked together, if Ian and I helped"
1488,"you, surely it's worth a try? "
1489,"DOCTOR: Yes, my dear, I know it's worth a try but you don't think the"
1490,Daleks are going to sit back and allow us to tinker do you? They're
1491,right on our tracks. Their one aim is to destroy. 
1492,"IAN: The Dalek time machine. Of course. Doctor, I've got it. We can't"
1493,"go back for Vicki in the Tardis, but we can in the Daleks own time"

1495,DOCTOR: Do you mean capture their machine? 
1496,IAN: Why not? 
1497,"BARBARA: Well, that would take some doing. "
1498,"IAN: It's the only chance we've got, otherwise we'll never see Vicki"
1499,again. 
1500,DOCTOR: If we can only pull it off. 
1501,"BARBARA: Doctor, we have nothing to lose and now we have even more"
1502,reason to stop and fight. 
1503,"IAN: What do you say, Doctor? "
1504,"DOCTOR: I say yes. Yes, yes! Our next landing will be our battle ground"

1537,"IAN: Yes. Well, we won't have long to explore, Doctor, before the"
1538,Daleks arrive so lets get moving. 
1539,"DOCTOR: Yes, you are perfectly correct, perfectly correct. However, it"

1582,BARBARA: What does it matter so long as they stay on?

2229,DALEK 2: We await commands! 
2230,DALEK 3: The operation will proceed at once.

2236,DALEK 1: Annihilate! 
2237,MECHONOID: Fire. 
2238,"(The Mechonoid's flame thrower is no match for the Daleks, and it goes"
2239,BOOM. More Mechonoids arrive to grab Daleks and pin them in whilst the
2240,smoke gets thicker. Machine versus machine and the Mechanoids are
2241,winning.)

2245," BARBARA: Vicki. Vicki, are you all right? "
2246,"VICKI: Yes. Yes, thanks. How about the others? "
2247,"BARBARA: They're fine. Now, Vicki, remember the Doctor's device? Well"
2248,"it worked! The city's on fire. Look, you can see! "
2249,"DOCTOR: Vicki, my child, are you all right? "
2250,"VICKI: Yes, I'm fine. "
2251,"DOCTOR: Come along, let's get back to the Tardis. "
2252,VICKI: What about Steven? Where is he? 
2253,BARBARA: Steven went back to the city. 
2254,VICKI: What for? 
2255,"DOCTOR: We don't know, my child, and his chances of survival in this"
2256,furnace are utterly 
2257,IAN: Quick! That cable's on fire and the whole buildings collapsing! 
2258,"VICKI: No, we can't!"

2263, IAN : Halt! You will be exterminated! 
2264,"(Ian comes out, holding his nose.) "
2265,IAN: Exterminated! 
2266,"BARBARA: Oh, Ian! "
2267,"IAN: Doctor, it's empty. You've done it again! You've beaten them! "
2268,"DOCTOR: My dear boy, I could kiss you! "
2269,"BARBARA: Don't waste it on him, kiss me instead! "
2270,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'd be delighted! You know, this must be an extremely"
2271,"advanced machine. Wherever we went, it followed us with such great"
2272,precision and accuracy. You could travel anywhere in it. 
2273,"VICKI: It's huge inside, you know, just like the Tardis. "
2274,"DOCTOR: Of course, my dear, I'd forgotten. You've taken a trip in it. "
2275,VICKI: Shall I show you round? 
2276,"DOCTOR: My dear, I shall be delighted. "
2277,IAN: After you! 
2278,(The Doctor and Vicki go inside.) 
2279,"BARBARA: Ian, do you realise we could get home? "
2280,IAN: Home? Yes. Do you want to? 
2281,BARBARA: Yes. I never realised it before. 
2282,IAN: Neither did I. We may never get another chance. 
2283,BARBARA: Do you think we could work it? 
2284,"IAN: Well, would the Doctor take us? "
2285,BARBARA: Let's ask him.
2286,
2287,[Jungle] 
2288,STEVEN: Doctor! 
2289,"(Clutching Hi-Fi, Steven nearly gets caught by a fungoid.) "
2290,[Jungle]
2291,
2292, DOCTOR : I don't want to know! I want none of
2293,this! I've never heard such nonsense in my life! You'll end up as a
2294,"couple of burnt cinders, flying around in space. You idiots! You are"
2295,absolute idiots! 
2296,BARBARA: We are not idiots! We want to go home! 
2297,"IAN: Yes, home! I want to sit in a pub and drink a pint of beer again."
2298,"I want to walk in a park and watch a cricket match. Above all, I want"
2299,"to belong somewhere, do something, instead of this aimless drifting"
2300,around in space. 
2301,DOCTOR: Aimless? I've tried for two years to get you both home! 
2302,"IAN: Well, you haven't been very successful, have you? "
2303,"DOCTOR: How dare you, young man. How dare you, sir! I didn't even"
2304,invite you into the ship in the first place. You both thrust yourselves
2305,upon me! 
2306,"BARBARA: Oh, Doctor, stop it! "
2307,"DOCTOR: Oh, for heavens sake, I've never heard such nonsense. "
2308,"BARBARA: Look, I know we thrust ourselves upon you, but we've through a"
2309,great deal together since then. And all we've been through will remain
2310,with us always. It'll probably be the most exciting part of my life.
2311,"Look, Doctor, we're different people, and now we have a chance to go"
2312,home. We want to take that chance. Will you help us work that machine? 
2313,DOCTOR: No! No! I will not aid and abet suicide. 
2314,"IAN: Oh, he's as stubborn as a mule. "
2315,"VICKI: Doctor? Doctor, you've got to let them go if they want to. They"
2316,want to be back in their own time. 
2317,"DOCTOR: Don't you want to go with them, child? "
2318,VICKI: What for? What would I want to be back in their time for? I want
2319,"to be with you. Doctor, you've got to help them. "
2320,"DOCTOR: Don't you realise, child, the enormous risks? "
2321,VICKI: But it's up to them. 
2322,DOCTOR: Do you both realise the enormous risks? 
2323,IAN: We do. We still want to go. 
2324,"BARBARA: Please, Doctor. "
2325,"DOCTOR: Very well, follow me. But you must follow my instructions"
2326,"implicitly, understood? Implicitly! You will both have about a"
2327,"fifty-fifty chance. Follow me, come along. "

2341,(He goes inside and something starts beeping) 
2342,IAN: Run! 
2343,(KaBOOM) 
2344,"IAN: Well, that's put paid to the Dalek's time travelling for a while. "
2345,BARBARA: It'll give the Doctor a breather anyway. 
2346,IAN: Yes. I wonder where he is right now? 
2347,"BARBARA: Hey, Doctor, wherever you are. "
2348,IAN: Shh! There's someone coming.
