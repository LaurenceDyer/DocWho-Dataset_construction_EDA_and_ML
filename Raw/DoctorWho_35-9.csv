19, (Transcriber's
20,"note: Watching this one gave me a headache, literally, what with the static flashes and"
21,"frequent point of view changes - colour for a person, black and white"
22,"for external. Yes, Mister Gatiss, very clever I'm sure. So I haven't"
23,documented them all. I just cannot be bothered. Just the important (I
24,think) ones.)
25,
26,(A screen full of static.)
27,RASSMUSSEN : You
28,must not watch this. 
29,"(The image clears to reveal a man's face. He wears large spectacles,"
30,and speaks directly to the viewer.)
31,RASSMUSSEN: I'm warning you. You can never unsee it. (static
32,flicker)  But if you do watch. Gagan Rassmussen.
33,I'm Gagan Rassmussen.
34,This is Le Verrier lab in orbit around Neptune.
35,
36,(He turns as something large groans unseen in the background.)
37,RASSMUSSEN: I've put things together into some kind of order
38,"so that you can,er, understand, so that you can have some idea. There"
39,are bits missing. Sorry about that.
40,"I don't fully understand what's been going on here,  but,"
41,"er, this is what happened."
42,"(The screen is filled with apparently random letters and numbers, but"
43,which actually spell out the names of the characters and location
44,"across, and Doctor Who illuminated vertically."
45,
46,[Rescue ship]
47,
48,"(A soldier is kneeling, checking a rifle.)"
49,CHOPRA: Stop staring!
54,RASSMUSSEN : They came from Triton. This is
55,"Chopra. Bit of an attitude, in my opinion."
56,(A stocky soldier with a white face that has black lines up and down
57,and across it turns away.)
58,"NAGATA: (woman with a Geordie accent) Calm down, pet."
59,"CHOPRA: Well, it's ridiculous. That thing's meant to be a lethal"
60,fighting machine
61,and it just moons around like a love-sick puppy.
62,(A soldier sits up from from an opening pod and puts on his helmet.
63,Neon blue tubes are still attached to him.)
64,"DEEP-ANDO: I could hear you ranting from inside the pod, Chopra,"
65,for the Gods' sake. 
66,NAGATA: Feel better?
67,
68,"RASSMUSSEN: Commander Nagata. Young, for the"
69,"responsibility. Quite a baptism of fire, I'm afraid."
70,
71,
72,"DEEP-ANDO: Marvellous, ma'am."
73,"All hail, Morpheus, eh?"
74,
75,RASSMUSSEN : Deep-Ando. Conscript. Likes to think of himself as
76,"the joker of this little group. Well, he did."
79,"CHOPRA: Morpheus, Morpheus, Morpheus. Sleep's the one thing left to us."
80,The one thing they couldn't get their filthy mitts on.
81,"Now, they're even grabbing that. Colonising it."
82,
83,NAGATA: Spoken like a true Rip.
84,
85,"CHOPRA: Oh, don't call me that."
86,
87,"NAGATA: Don't call me that, ma'am. Give it a rest, pet. "
88,CHOPRA: Give what a rest?
89,
90,"NAGATA: This is a mission, Chopra. We find out what's happened on Le"
91,Verrier
92,"and then we all go home. Keep your politics to yourself, okay?"
93,
94,DEEP-ANDO: I know someone who'd love to get Chopra
95,"back home to Triton, eh? Ho-ho!"
96,(He goes to the person with the strange face.)
97,"RASSMUSSEN : This one's obvious from the markings, isn't"
98,it. We all know a Grunt when we see one.
99,(474. Age 5. Rank: Grunt. Survival rating 9/10.)
100,"(474 takes a step forward and Deep-Ando backs away, hands raised.)"
101,"DEEP-ANDO: Whoa, whoa."
102,NAGATA: Come on. Behave.
103,(We see they are flying through space to a satellite station above a
104,very blue gas giant.)
105,"NAGATA: Nearly there, kiddies."
106,RASSMUSSEN : These are the rescue crew. Don't get too
107,attached. Everything you're about to see is from their
108,individual viewpoints or
109,taken from the station itself. 
110,(A monitor says 2 minutes to docking.)
111,RASSMUSSEN : The only footage available.
112,
113,RASSMUSSEN: They came to find me. This is my station. My lab. 
114,
115,[Corridor]
116,
117,RASSMUSSEN : I've pieced together the rescue as best I
118,"could. If you're going to watch, then pay close"
119,attention. Your lives may depend on it.
120,(The team go down the docking tunnel to the station itself. Static
121,flash on screen.)
122,NAGATA: Emergency lighting only.
123,CHOPRA: Grav and orbit's stable. There must be power.
124,
125,"(The doors to the docking tunnel close and they move on, lighting the"
126,way with flashlights on their rifles.)
127,NAGATA: Nothing?
128,(474 shakes her head.)
129,NAGATA: No sign of anyone.
130,
131,"RASSMUSSEN: There was no crew. No crew left. They did find others,"
132,though. Strangers.
133,
134,[Corridor]
135,
136,NAGATA: What the hell happened here?
137,474: Hide seek. Maybe they play hide seek.
138,
139,CHOPRA: Hide and seek! Why do they miss out words?
140,It's infuriating.
141,"474: Chopra, don't be anger."
142,CHOPRA: Don't be an-gry! Is it so hard to
143,breed them to speak properly?
144,
145,"DEEP-ANDO: Oh, lighten up."
146,(474 holds up a clenched fist and they all stop.)
147,CHOPRA: What now? 
148,474: Talk.
149,CHOPRA: What? 
150,474: People talk.
151,CLARA : Do you ever get the feeling like you're being watched?
152,
153,(The soldiers move quietly but quickly to a junction with another
154,corridor.)
155,DOCTOR : Paranoia.
156,CLARA : Why is it so dark?
157,
158,DOCTOR : Night-time setting.
159,Faulty filament. Three-day week.
160,"CLARA : So, orbit around Neptune?"
161,
162,"DOCTOR : Yeah. This close into the planet,"
163,they must have some pretty powerful
164,anti-grav shielding on board.
165,
166,(Clara's flash light reveals an oriental mask on a red wall.)
167,CLARA: Looks like a Japanese restaurant. Oh! Have you brought me
168,to a space restaurant?
169,"DOCTOR : People never do that, you know?"
170,
171,CLARA: Do what?
172,
173,DOCTOR: They never put the word space in front of something
174,just because everything's all
175,sort of hi-tech and future-y.
176,It's never space restaurant
177,"or space champagne or space, you know, hat. It's"
178,"just restaurant, champagne or hat."
179,(The soldiers follow them as they walk.) 
180,DOCTOR: Even if this was a restaurant
181,CLARA: What about spacesuit? 
182,DOCTOR: Pedant.
183,"(The Doctor and Clara turn as they hear the energy rifles powering up,"
184,eyes wide like rabbits in caught in car headlights.)
185,DOCTOR: Hello. 
186,CLARA: Are you crew? Are you crew?
187,(The Doctor carefully reaches into his inside jacket pocket and gets
188,out his psychic paper. He holds up up to each soldier until -)
189,NAGATA: Engineering stress assessors?
190,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, we are."
191,(He puts the psychic paper away again.)
192,"DOCTOR: We're here to, er."
193,
194,CLARA: We're here to assess stress.
195,
196,DOCTOR: Stress. 
197,"NAGATA: So, what happened?"
198,
199,DOCTOR: From the beginning of time? That's a very long story.
200,
201,CLARA: (sotto) Doctor.
202,"DOCTOR: Well. Well, we just arrived, you know, and there was nobody"
203,about. What are you doing here?
204,(Nagata lowers her rifle.)
205,"NAGATA: Twenty four hours ago, this station fell silent. No comm"
206,signal. Nothing. Dead. We've come to find out why.
207,DOCTOR: Theories?
208,NAGATA: Could be anything. Meteorite strike. Space pirates.
209,"CLARA: Ah, see? Not just pirates, space"
210,pirates.
211,
212,"DOCTOR: So, what, you are"
213,a rescue mission? 
214,NAGATA: Yes.
215,
216,DOCTOR: Of four? 
217,"NAGATA: Cuts, pet. Right, you're to consider yourself"
218,DOCTOR: (sings) ♪ Part of the furniture! ♪
219,NAGATA: Under my command.
220,DOCTOR: Okay. Really? 
221,"NAGATA: Yes, really. Come on."
222,DOCTOR: (sotto) Okay.
223,(The Doctor and Clara follow at a short distance.)
224,CLARA: We still don't know where we are.
225,DOCTOR: Indo-Japanese.
226,(He wets his finger and holds it behind his right ear. We are
227,apparently watching from a wall screen.)
228,DOCTOR: Thirty eighth century. (tastes his finger again.) Tuesday. 
229,CLARA: Thirty eighth century?
230,"DOCTOR: Hmm. After the Great Catastrophe, there was a tectonic"
231,realignment. India
232,"and Japan, they were sort of merged."
233,"CLARA: We still don't know where the rest of the crew are, though."
234,"I mean, a place this size? Hey, what? Great Catastrophe? What"
235,Great Catastrophe?
236,"DOCTOR: Well, you've got all that to look forward to, haven't you?"
237,"Mind you, this place looks as if it's been dead for a long while now."
238,
239,"(He runs his finger along an edge then blows a lot of dust off it, and"
240,looks straight at us. Static flicker to change of scene / viewpoint.
241,They have caught up with the soldiers again.)
242,DOCTOR: What is it?
243,CLARA: I still can't shake the feeling.
244,474: Eyes. Watch. Eyes in sky.
245,CHOPRA: What the hell is that supposed to mean?
246,
247,474: Chopra not worry. 474 protect Chopra. Chopra pretty.
248,(474 reaches to stroke Chopra's cheek and he slaps the hand away.)
249,"CHOPRA: Oh, for the Gods'. Just back off!"
250,(Chopra pushes 474 who reacts by getting behind him and putting on a
251,choke hold.)
252,"DEEP-ANDO Oh, come on now."
253,"NAGATA: Let him go, pet! "
254,474: 474 sorry.
255,"NAGATA: Let him go, now! "
256,474: Not help it!
257,(The software display tells us that 474 is programmed to respond to
258,physical threat. She releases Chopra from the choke hold and crouches
259,"by the wall, whimpering.)"
260,CHOPRA: It could have killed me!
261,NAGATA: That's how they're grown. You know that. They react to any
262,attack.
263,
264,CLARA: Grown? 
265,"NAGATA: They might not give them much upstairs, but our friend here"
266,certainly knows how to fight.
267,
268,(The Doctor kneels in front of 474.)
269,"NAGATA: You'd be glad of her in a tight corner, I'll bet."
270,
271,"CLARA: What does she mean, grown?"
272,"DOCTOR: She's a Grunt, Clara. They're bred in hatcheries. Cloned"
273,muscles. Low intelligence. Brute force. Instant army.
274,CLARA: That's disgusting.
275,"DOCTOR: Well, that's how they roll in the thirty eighth century."
276,(Something large growls and moans.)
277,DOCTOR: (sotto) Hold my hand.
278,CLARA: I'm okay.
279,DOCTOR: I'm not.
280,(Clara takes the Doctor's hand.)
281,"(Another growl nearby, and they panic as the lights on the rifles"
282,briefly illuminate two humanoid creatures ahead of them.. Some shots
283,"are fired, then they turn and -)"
284,"DOCTOR: Oh, run, run, run! Run! Run!"
285,
286,(At a junction.)
287,DEEP-ANDO: Follow me! Straight ahead.
288,NAGATA: No! This way! Deep-Ando!
289,DEEP-ANDO : Come on!
290,
291,[Laboratory]
292,
293,DOCTOR: Quick! Push anything in front of it!
294,We've got to keep them out!
295,
296,(The Doctor moves a cabinet as Chopra tries to push the door shut.)
297,NAGATA: Deep-Ando! We've lost him! What the hell are they?
298,DOCTOR: Not pirates.
299,
300,NAGATA: We've got to get Deep-Ando!
301,
302,DOCTOR: Where's your friend?
303,CHOPRA: Deep-Ando? I dunno. He's
304,
305,NAGATA: He's still out there!
306,
307,(The creatures are pushing at the door. One thrusts an arm through the
308,gap.)
309,NAGATA: 474!
310,"(474 charges the door, shutting it and cutting off the arm, which turns"
311,to sand and falls to the floor.)
312,NAGATA: What the hell are they? Where did they go?
313,
314,[Corridor]
315,
316,"DEEP-ANDO: Chief Nagata, this is Deep-Ando. Where did you"
317,"go? Nagata, this is Deep-Ando. May the Gods look favourably"
318,upon you. (static) May the Gods. Are you there?
319,"(He walks on, sweeping his flash light around as he goes.)"
320,
321,[Laboratory]
322,
323,"NAGATA: Deep-Ando, this is Nagata. May the Gods look favourably upon"
324,you.
325,"Deep-Ando, are you there?"
326,(The Doctor takes a sample of the sand from the floor and puts it under
327,a microscope.)
328,NAGATA: What are you doing?
329,DOCTOR: Finding out what they're made of.
330,"NAGATA: Deep-Ando, are you there?"
331,CHOPRA: Send the Grunt.
332,NAGATA: No.
333,"CHOPRA: Why not? That's what it's for. Look, he's still out there! You"
334,can't just abandon him.
335,
336,NAGATA: I need proper intel before
337,"I risk anyone else, including 474."
338,Keep trying the comms.
339,"CHOPRA: Deep-Ando, may the Gods look favourably upon you."
340,
341,NAGATA: Well? 
342,DOCTOR: Organic. Definitely organic. Blood cells. Skin cells. Mucus.
343,"474: Deep-Ando, may the Gods look favourably upon you. Deep-Ando."
344,(Clara is standing between two large white cabinets.)
345,CLARA: What are these? 
346,CHOPRA: Morpheus?
347,
348,CLARA: Morpheus?
349,"Named after the God of Dreams? Oh, yeah."
350,"Ooh, yeah. Not just this."
351,
352,(She indicates her pretty face.)
353,"CLARA: So, what are they, then? Sleep pods?"
354,
355,CHOPRA: More than that.
356,"(static) Deep-Ando? Deep-Ando, can you hear me? "
357,NAGATA: Keep trying.
358,
359,"DOCTOR: I could take a look at that. You know, triangulate the signal,"
360,help you find your friend.
361,"NAGATA: First, tell me what those things are."
362,
363,"CHOPRA: Deep, Deep-Ando."
364,
365,DEEP-ANDO : (sotto) This is Deep
366,
367,"CHOPRA: Deep-Ando, this is Chopra. I'm getting a signal. Deep-Ando, can"
368,"you hear me? Deep-Ando? Deep-Ando, this is Chopra. Can you hear me?"
369,
370,CLARA: Doctor! 
371,(Thud. Clara has disappeared inside a Morpheus cabinet.)
372,DOCTOR: Clara!
373,"(An alarm sounds, then four small holographic ladies in Dior New Style"
374,dresses with full skirts appear on the cabinet and start singing Pat
375,"Ballard's 1954 hit, just like the Chordettes did.)"
376,"SINGERS: ♪ Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom. Mister Sandman, bring me your"
377,dreams. ♪
378,DOCTOR: Clara!
379,
380,"NAGATA: It's fine, it's just Morpheus."
381,
382,SINGERS: ♪ Make him the cutest that I've ever seen. ♪
383,(The singers vanish as the Doctor opens the cabinet. Clara is lying
384,"there, eyes closed and with neon blue tubes attached to her head and"
385,hands.)
386,DOCTOR: What did you think you were doing?
387,(She opens her eyes and he removes the tubing.)
388,"CLARA: Huh? (she sits up) It dragged me in. The wires, they were like"
389,"snakes, like it was alive. "
390,DOCTOR: Are you okay?
391,
392,CLARA: Yeah. It just kind of flicked over my eyes. Did I sleep?
393,
394,"CHOPRA: Yeah, you did. "
395,"CLARA: Why, why did it just grab at me?"
396,
397,DOCTOR: Semi-sentient. It thinks it knows what's good for you.
398,You obviously needed forty winks. Clever little sleep pod. You said it
399,"was something more than that, though."
400,
401,(Static flicker on picture.)
402,"NAGATA: Come on, everyone knows. "
403,"DOCTOR: (to camera) Well, let's just say, for the sake of argument,"
404,that we don't. What is
405,Morpheus?
406,
407,474: Last pod. This pod. Not empty.
408,(The Doctor puts on his sonic sunglasses. The singers return on the
409,last pod.)
410,"SINGERS: ♪ Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom. ♪"
411,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. No, no. enough of that. "
412,(He pulls out a 38th century square DVD and they vanish. He takes off his
413,glasses then tries to force down the shutter over the observation hatch
414,where the sleeper's head should be.)
415,DOCTOR: It's almost like someone's
416,(He nearly gets it open and it slams shut again.)
417,CLARA: Careful! 
418,(Weapons are powered up.)
419,CLARA: Here. Let me try.
420,(She listens to the regular buzz from the pod then taps on the metal
421,cover.)
422,CLARA: Hellooo? It's okay.
423,We're not going to hurt you.
424,"Will you open up now? Come on. Let's er, let's start with names, shall"
425,we?
426, Er I'm Clara. This is the Doctor.
427,(The hatch opens.) 
428,CLARA: It's okay.
429,(Rassmussen pokes his head out of the pod. Freeze image.) 
430,"RASSMUSSEN : Ah, this is where I come in."
431,
432,RASSMUSSEN: Hello. I wanted to get out of there. Immediately. Of course
433,"I did. But er, this man, the Doctor, he wanted explanations first. So"
434,
435,[Laboratory]
436,
437,(A large holographic disembodied lady's head appears above the pods.)
438,PRESENTER: May the Gods look favourably upon us all.
439,Friends. We live in a time of unparalleled prosperity. A golden age of
440,"peace, harmony and industry."
441,But every shift must come to an end. Every working day must stop. 
442,(A holographic yawning woman appears on her outsized hand.) 
443,PRESENTER: Of
444,"course, we can take stimulants"
445,"to make that deadline, to keep us propped up through that important"
446,"meeting. But always, always, sleep claims us in the end. "
447,(The woman lies down to sleep.)
448,PRESENTER: Until now. 
449,DOCTOR: Sleep-deprivation pods?
450,CHOPRA: Not exactly. 
451,"PRESENTER: Welcome, Morpheus."
452,"SINGERS : ♪ Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom. (song continues"

454,PRESENTER: The Morpheus machine concentrates the whole nocturnal
455,experience into
456,one five minute burst.
457,"Now, you can go a whole month without sleep. "
458,CLARA: A month? 
459,"PRESENTER: All the chemical benefits of rest, but freeing up the nights"
460,to
461,"continue working, working, working."
462,To get the edge on your competitor. To turn that extra profit.
463,CLARA: That's insane. That's horrible!
464,"CHOPRA: Finally, someone who sees it for what it is."
465,PRESENTER: Leave the Rip Van Winkles behind and become one of a new
466,generation
467,of Wide-Awakes! The future is here. The future is now. Let yourself
468,slip into the arms of Morpheus! 
469,"SINGERS : ♪ Mister Sandman, bring me a dream. ♪"
470,(The Presenter's head vanishes.)
471,DOCTOR: But sleep is 
472,(And reappears.)
473,PRESENTER: Terms and conditions apply. 
474,(And gone again.)
475,DOCTOR: Sleep is vital. Sleep is wonderful. Even I
476,sleep. 
477,CLARA: When?
478,"DOCTOR: Well, when you're not looking. "
479,(The Doctor leans forward and stares at us. The viewpoint turns look at
480,"the next speaker, and keeps swinging around as others join in the"
481,conversation.)
482,RASSMUSSEN: Morpheus is mine. My invention. It's changed Triton society
483,forever.
484,"DOCTOR: So, how does it work?"
485,"RASSMUSSEN: Er, the pod sends out a coded electronic signal that acts"
486,on certain
487,parts of the brain. Changes the fundamental chemistry.
488,CHOPRA: It's disgusting. Making people into bloody drones. I've said it
489,before
490,
491,"NAGATA: Aye, you have."
492,
493,CHOPRA: Colonising our sleep. Is nothing sacred?
494,
495,RASSMUSSEN: We spend a third of our lives asleep. And time is money.
496,
497,"NAGATA: He's right, man. It's amazing. Everyone on Triton's using it."
498,"DOCTOR: Are they now? Sleep, that knits up the ravelled sleeve"
499,of care. The death of each
500,"day's life, sore labour's bath. Balm of hurt minds, chief nourisher in"
501,"life's great feast. Congratulations, Professor. You've revolutionised the labour market."
502,You've conquered nature.
503,RASSMUSSEN: Thank you.
504,DOCTOR: You've also created an abomination.
505,
506,RASSMUSSEN: The Doctor said that we had to find the other soldier.
507,"And to find answers. So, we left the lab. He thought that there was"
508,some connection between my Morpheus process
509,and those creatures that attacked us.
510," Anyway, you'll see, he had a theory."
511,
512,[Corridor]
513,
514,(We are watching from Clara's viewpoint.)
515,CHOPRA: Sleep dust? 
516,DOCTOR: Sleep dust. 
517,NAGATA: You're kidding.
518,
519,DOCTOR: Well do I look like I'm kidding? Is this a kidding face? Ask
520,the crew of this station if they're
521,kidding. Or what's left of them.

990,NAGATA: Any ideas? 
991,DOCTOR: The doors are not a problem.
992,(He puts on his sonic sunglasses.)
993,NAGATA: But that is.
994,(Rassmussen is operating controls.)
995,DOCTOR: We need a distraction.
996,(He takes the song holo-disc from his pocket.)
997,"DOCTOR: When I say run, run."
998,(He puts the holo-DVD on a storage container and activates it.)
999,DOCTOR: Hey! Sandy!
1000,"SINGERS: ♪ Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom ♪"
1001,
1002,DOCTOR: Run! 
1003,(The Sandman is distracted by the holograms.)
1004,"SINGERS: ♪ Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom ♪"
1005,DOCTOR: Doors! 
1006,"SINGERS: ♪ Mister Sandman, bring me your"
1007,dreams. ♪ 
1008,(The doors open and they run into the compartment where Rassmussen is
1009,working the controls. Doors close again.)
1010,DOCTOR: Rassmussen! Turn off the engines. Shut this ship down! 
1011,"RASSMUSSEN: I can't do that, I'm afraid, Doctor. We can't fight the"
1012,inevitable. Humanity's day is done. 
1013,"NAGATA: Yeah? Well, Humanity might have something to say about that,"
1014,pet. 
1015,"(Nagata shoots Rassmussen, who falls back into a chair.)"
1016,RASSMUSSEN: Argh! 
1017,DOCTOR: No! 
1018,CLARA: Is that your answer for everything?
1019,NAGATA: Did you have a better one? 
1020,"DOCTOR: He's not the only one dead. According to this data, we're the"
1021,only ones left alive on this station.
1022,
1023,(The Sandman bangs on the door. We can still hear the Singers too.)
1024,CLARA: Doctor.
1025,"NAGATA: Come on, man. We've got to go!"
1026,(The Doctor has his glasses on again.)
1027,DOCTOR: This doesn't make any sense. 
1028,CLARA: What?
1029,DOCTOR: A man who hasn't slept for five years?
1030,"CLARA: Well, you heard what he said. That's the first Morpheus patient."
1031,DOCTOR: But the dust consumes the host.
1032,CLARA: And then they make Sandmen. They conglomerate. 
1033,DOCTOR: We escaped from that cold storage room because they were blind.
1034, And why power down the grav-shields when he did?
1035, It's like this is all for effect.
1036,"CLARA: Look, can we maybe have this conversation when we get off this"
1037,thing?
1038,(The Doctor removes his glasses.)
1039,DOCTOR: Like a story.
1040,NAGATA: Come on!
1041,
1042,[Docking tube]
1043,
1044,NAGATA: How do we get off this crate?
1045,
1046,DOCTOR: Alternative transport. 
1047,(The Sandman forces the tube doors open and follows them.)
1048,
1049,[Storage area]
1050,
1051,"DOCTOR: We have to get to Triton, destroy all the Morpheus machines."
1052,End this.
1053,This is how we get home? 
1054,CLARA: I've never been so pleased to see
1055,(Sandmen move between them and the Tardis. More approach from behind.)
1056,DOCTOR: Nagata!
1057,(He turns Nagata round and uses her helmet schematic projector on a
1058,copper sheet.)
1059,"CLARA: Doctor, quickly!"
1060,(The Doctor taps the projection of the anti-grav shield generators.)
1061,NAGATA: What did you just do? 
1062,DOCTOR: Self-destructed the grav-shields. 
1063,NAGATA: What? 
1064,(The spacestation tilts. The women cry out.)
1065,DOCTOR: It's working!
1066,(Clara uses her key to open the Tardis door. The Sandmen are
1067,"stationary, falling to pieces.)"
1068,"DOCTOR: Neptune's gravity is pulling them apart, bit by bit! It doesn't"
1069,make sense. None of this makes any sense.
1070,(They run inside the Tardis and it dematerialises.)
1071,
1072,(The station is shaking as Rassmussen pops up on our screen. We now
1073,know these messages have been compiled in the rescue ship.)
1074,"RASSMUSSEN: Hello again! Thing is, you see, this message, this"
1075,"testament, it wasn't just my"
1076,alibi. It was my plan.
1077,"There are no spores, no infection. The Morpheus process remains the"
1078,same. An electronic signal that affects the sleep centres of the brain.
1079,Changes them. An electronic signal that's contained in this recording.
1080,"(static flicker.) There it is. Tickles, doesn't it? I've just got time"
1081,to fit this bit in
1082,"and then I can finish the story, and then I'm going to transmit this"
1083,footage to the whole Solar System. I do
1084,hope you've enjoyed the show. I did try to make it exciting. All those
1085,"scary bits. All those death-defying scrapes, monsters, and a proper"
1086,climax with a really big one at the end! Compulsive viewing. I did tell
1087,you not to watch.
1088,"(Rassmussen rubs his eye. Dust falls out, leaving a hole in his head.)"
1089,RASSMUSSEN: (deeper slower voice) There's nothing left of Rassmussen
1090,any more. Only us.
1091,"Only us. You will show this film to your family, won't you?"
1092,"And your friends. And everyone, really. Then we can all be together,"
1093,"dust to dust. Excuse me, you've got something there, just in the corner"
1094,of your eye.
1095,(Rassmussen's head falls to dust as he points to the top left corner of
1096,"the screen. He laughs as he crumbles to pieces, then the cathode ray"
1097,"screen goes black, with just a small fading dot of"
1098,light in the centre.)
