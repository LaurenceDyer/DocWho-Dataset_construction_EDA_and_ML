20,
21,(Everyone is hanging on to the console.) 
22,DONNA: What the hell's it doing? 
23,DOCTOR: The control's not working. 
24,(He gets thrown about and gets a look at the jar at the base of the
25,time rotor.) 
26,"DOCTOR: I don't know where we're going, but my old hand's very excited"
27,about it. 
28,DONNA: I thought that was just some freaky alien thing. You telling me
29,it's yours? 
30,DOCTOR: Well. 
31,MARTHA: It got cut off. He grew a new one. 
32,DONNA: You are completely impossible. 
33,DOCTOR: Not impossible. Just a bit unlikely. 
34,"(There's a bang, and sparks, then stillness and peace. The Doctor runs"
35,outside.) 
36,[Tunnel entrance]
37,
38,(It looks like a junk yard in a railway arch at
39,night.) 
40,"DOCTOR: Why would the Tardis bring us here, then? "
41,"MARTHA: Oh, I love this bit. "
42,DONNA: I thought you wanted to go home. 
43,"MARTHA: I know, but all the same, it's that feeling you get. "
44,DONNA: Like you swallowed a hamster? 
45,CLINE: Don't move! Stay where you are! Drop your weapons. 
46,"(Three men are pointing rifles at them, so they raise their hands.) "
47,"DOCTOR: We're unarmed. Look, no weapons. Never any weapons. We're safe."
48,
49,SOLDIER: Look at their hands. They're clean. 
50,"CLINE: All right, process them. Him first. "
51,(Two soldiers take the Doctor.) 
52,"DOCTOR: Oi, oi. What's wrong with clean hands? "
53,MARTHA: What's going on? 
54,(The Doctor is taken to a machine and his right arm is pushed inside
55,it.) 
56,DONNA: Leave him alone. 
57,(Something inside grabs his arm.) 
58,DOCTOR: Something tells me this isn't about to check my blood pressure.
59,Argh! 
60,(It clearly hurts.) 
61,DONNA: What are you doing to him? 
62,CLINE: Everyone gets processed. 
63,"DOCTOR: It's taken a tissue sample. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. And"
64,extrapolated it. Some kind of accelerator? 
65,(The Doctor is released.) 
66,MARTHA: Are you all right? 
67,(There is a graze on the back of his hand.) 
68,DOCTOR: What on earth? That's just 
69,(A pair of glass and metal doors open and a figure steps out from the
70,steam of the brightly lit interior. She is a skinny blonde woman in
71,"combat boots and trousers, and a khaki t-shirt.) "
72,CLINE: Arm yourself. 
73,(He hands the newcomer a rifle.) 
74,MARTHA: Where did she come from? 
75,DOCTOR: From me. 
76,DONNA: From you?. How? Who is she? 
77,(The woman checks the rifle is ready for use.) 
78,"DOCTOR: Well, she's, well, she's my daughter. "
79,(The real-life daughter of 5th Doctor Peter Davison smiles and speaks.)
80,
81,"JENNY: Hello, Dad. "
82,CLINE: You primed to take orders? Ready to fight? 
83,"JENNY: Instant mental download of all strategic and military protocols,"
84,sir. Generation five thousand soldier primed and in peak physical
85,"health. Oh, I'm ready. "
86,(She takes her place with Cline and the other soldiers at a barricade.)
87,
88,DONNA: Did you say daughter? 
89,DOCTOR: Mmm. Technically. 
90,MARTHA: Technically how? 
91,DOCTOR: Progenation. Reproduction from a single organism. Means one
92,parent is biological mother and father. You take a sample of diploid
93,"cells, split them into haploids, then recombine them in a different"
94,"arrangement and grow. Very quickly, apparently. "
95,JENNY: Something's coming. 
96,"(There are shadows on the tunnel wall. As they come into view, the"
97,figures start firing.) 
98,CLINE: It's the Hath! 
99,(They return fire.) 
100,JENNY: Get down! 
101,"(The Doctor, Martha and Donna take cover. The Hath are wearing"
102,"breathing masks, but we can see they have big fish eyes and very"
103,wrinkled necks.) 
104,CLINE: We have to blow the tunnel. Get the detonator. 
105,DOCTOR: I'm not detonating anything. 
106,(The Doctor goes to help a wounded soldier. The Hath breach the
107,"barricade and one grabs Martha. Jenny takes on another hand to hand,"
108,then gets the detonator.) 
109,CLINE: Blow the thing! Blow the thing! 
110,DOCTOR: Martha! No. Don't. 
111,(Jenny hits the button. A klaxon sounds and everyone runs before the
112,big KaBOOM
113,brings down the roof.) 
114,DOCTOR: You've sealed off the tunnel. Why did you do that? 
115,JENNY: They were trying to kill us. 
116,DOCTOR: But they've got my friend. 
117,JENNY: Collateral damage. At least you've still got her. He lost both
118,his men. I'd say you came out ahead. 
119,"DONNA: Her name's Martha. And she's not collateral damage, not for"
120,"anyone. Have you got that, GI Jane? "
121,DOCTOR: I'm going to find her. 
122,"CLINE: You're going nowhere. You don't make sense, you two. No guns, no"
123,"marks, no fight in you. I'm taking you to General Cobb. Now, move. "
124,"(On the other side of the tunnel blockage, Martha wakes up and hears a"
125,bubbling sound. It is an injured Hath.) 
126,"MARTHA: Hold on, I've got you. Is it your arm, yeah? "
127,(The Hath bubbles its green breathing liquid.) 
128,"MARTHA: Is that a yes? Let me examine it. Keep still. Still, yeah? No"
129,move. 
130,(The Hath nods.) 
131,"MARTHA: Half fish, half human? How am I supposed to know? Is that a"
132,shoulder? Feels like a shoulder. I think it's dislocated. 
133,(More armed Hath arrive.) 
134,"MARTHA: I'm trying to help him. I am a doctor and he is my patient, and"
135,"I'm not leaving him. Now, this is going to hurt. One, two, three. "
136,(Martha puts the shoulder back into its place. The Hath cock their
137,"weapons, then the injured one intervenes, bubbling the explanation."
138,Everyone relaxes again.) 
139,"MARTHA: Now, then. I'm Doctor Martha Jones. Who the hell are you? "
140,[Tunnel]
141,
142,(Deeper underground.) 
143,DONNA: I'm Donna. What's you name? 
144,JENNY: Don't know. It's not been assigned. 
145,"DONNA: Well, if you don't know that, what do you know? "
146,JENNY: How to fight. 
147,DONNA: Nothing else? 
148,"DOCTOR: The machine must embed military history and tactics, but no"
149,name. She's a generated anomaly. 
150,"DONNA: Generated anomaly. Generated. Well, what about that? Jenny. "
151,"JENNY: Jenny. Yeah, I like that. Jenny. "
152,"DONNA: What do you think, Dad? "
153,"DOCTOR: Good as anything, I suppose. "
154,"DONNA: Not what you'd call a natural parent, are you? "
155,DOCTOR: They stole a tissue sample at gunpoint and processed it. It's
156,not what I call natural parenting. 
157,DONNA: Rubbish. My friend Nerys fathered twins with a turkey baster.
158,Don't bother her. 
159,DOCTOR: You can't extrapolate a relationship from a biological
160,accident. 
161,"DONNA: Er, Child Support Agency can. "
162,"DOCTOR: Look, just because I share certain physiological traits with"
163,"simian primates doesn't make me a monkey's uncle, does it? "
164,JENNY: I'm not a monkey. Or a child.
165,
166,[Camp]
167,
168,(A large room with a slightly domed roof and a
169,gallery. There are more clone chambers here. The ambient lighting is
170,red.) 
171,"DOCTOR: So, where are we? What planet's this? "
172,"CLINE: Messaline. Well, what's left of it. "
173,TANNOY: Six six three seventy five deceased. Generation six six seven
174,"one, extinct. Generation six six seven two, forty six deceased."
175,"Generation six six eight zero, fourteen deceased. Generation six "
176,DONNA: But this is a theatre. 
177,DOCTOR: Maybe they're doing Miss Saigon. 
178,DONNA: It's like a town or a city underground. But why? 
179,(A man with a neatly trimmed white beard approaches.) 
180,"DOCTOR: General Cobb, I presume. "
181,"COBB: Found in the western tunnels, I'm told, with no marks. There was"
182,"an outbreak of pacifism in the eastern zone three generations back,"
183,before we lost contact. Is that where you came from? 
184,"DOCTOR: Eastern zone, that's us, yeah. Yeah. I'm The Doctor, this is"
185,Donna. 
186,JENNY: And I'm Jenny. 
187,COBB: Don't think you can infect us with your peacemaking. We're
188,"committed to the fight, to the very end. "
189,"DOCTOR: Well, that's all right. I can't stay, anyway. I've got to go"
190,and find my friend. 
191,COBB: That's not possible. All movement is regulated. We're at war. 
192,"DOCTOR: Yes, I noticed. With the Hath. But tell me, because we got a"
193,"bit out of circulation, eastern zone and all that. So who exactly are"
194,the Hath?Â 
195,"(The Hath take Martha to a very similar room, complete with clone"
196,"chambers, but the ambient lighting is blue.) "
197,"COBB: Back at the dawn of this planet, these ancient halls were carved"
198,from the earth. Our ancestors dreamt of a new beginning. A colony where
199,human and Hath would work and live together. 
200,DOCTOR: So what happened? 
201,"COBB: The dream died. Broken, along with Hath promises. They wanted it"
202,"all for themselves. But those early pioneers, they fought back. They"
203,"used the machines to produce soldiers instead of colonists, and began"
204,this battle for survival. 
205,"DONNA: There's nothing but earth outside, why's that? Why build"
206,everything underground? 
207,CLINE: The surface is too dangerous. 
208,"DONNA: Well, then why build windows in the first place? And what does"
209,this mean? 
210,(601707 something on a plaque.) 
211,COBB: The rites and symbols of our ancestors. The meaning's lost in
212,time. 
213,DOCTOR: How long's this war gone on for? 
214,COBB: Longer than anyone can remember. Countless generations marked
215,only by the dead. 
216,"DONNA: What, fighting all this time? "
217,JENNY: Because we must. Every child of the machine is born with this
218,"knowledge. It's our inheritance. It's all we know. How to fight, and"
219,how to die. 
220,[Hath camp]
221,
222,(The Hath show Martha a holographic map of the
223,tunnels and chambers.) 
224,MARTHA: Right. So we're here? 
225,[Camp]
226,
227,(The same thing is going on.) 
228,"DOCTOR: Does this show the entire city, including the Hath zones? "
229,COBB: Yes. Why? 
230,"DOCTOR: Well, it'll help us find Martha. "
231,CLINE: We've more important things to do. The progenation machines are
232,"powered down for the night shift, but soon as they're active, we could"
233,breed a whole platoon from you two. 
234,DONNA: I'm not having sons and daughters by some great big flipping
235,"machine. Sorry, no offence, but you're not. Well, I mean, you're not"
236,real. 
237,"JENNY: You're no better than him. I have a body, I have a mind, I have"
238,independent thought. How am I not real? What makes you better than me? 
239,"COBB: Well said, soldier. We need more like you, if ever we're to find"
240,the Source. 
241,"DOCTOR: Ooo, the Source. What's that, then? What's a Source? I like a"
242,Source. What is it? 
243,COBB: The Breath of Life. 
244,DOCTOR: And that would be? 
245,"CLINE: In the beginning, the great one breathed life into the universe."
246,"And then she looked at what she'd done, and she sighed. "
247,JENNY: She. I like that. 
248,DOCTOR: Right. So it's a creation myth. 
249,COBB: It's not myth. It's real. That sigh. From the beginning of time
250,it was caught and kept as the Source. It was lost when the war started.
251,"But it's here, somewhere. Whoever holds the Source controls the destiny"
252,of the planet. 
253,(The Doctor makes the map buzz.) 
254,DOCTOR: Ah! I thought so. There's a suppressed layer of information in
255,this map. If I can just 
256,"(He uses his sonic screwdriver on it, and up come more tunnels and"
257,chambers.) 
258,"DONNA: What is it, what's it mean? "
259,DOCTOR: See? A whole complex of tunnels hidden from sight. 
260,[Hath camp]
261,
262,"(They appear on the Hath's map, too.) "
263,MARTHA: Hold on. Look. 
264,
265,[Camp]
266,
267,COBB: That must be the lost temple. The Source will
268,"be inside. You've shown us the way. And look, we're closer than the"
269,Hath. It's ours. 
270,[Hath camp]
271,
272,MARTHA: That's a new map. There's a different set
273,of tunnels. 
274,[Camp]
275,
276,COBB: Tell them to prepare to move out. We'll
277,"progenate new soldiers on the morning shift, then we march. Once we"
278,"reach the Temple, peace will be restored at long last. "
279,"DOCTOR: Er, call me old-fashioned, but if you really wanted peace,"
280,couldn't you just stop fighting? 
281,COBB: Only when we have the Source. It'll give us the power to erase
282,every stinking Hath from the face of this planet. 
283,"DOCTOR: Hang on, hang on. A second ago it was peace in our time. Now"
284,you're talking about genocide. 
285,"COBB: For us, that means the same thing. "
286,"DOCTOR: Then you need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do,"
287,"look up genocide. You'll see a little picture of me there, and the"
288,"caption will read, over my dead body. "
289,COBB: And you're the one who showed us the path to victory. But you can
290,"consider the irony from your prison cell. Cline, at arms. "
291,"DONNA: Oi, oi, oi. All right. Cool the beans, Rambo. "
292,COBB: Take them. I won't have them spreading treason. And if you try
293,"anything, Doctor, I'll see that your woman dies first. "
294,"DOCTOR: No, we're, we're not a couple. "
295,DONNA: I am not his woman. 
296,CLINE: Come on. This way. 
297,"DOCTOR: I'm going to stop you, Cobb. You need to know that. "
298,"COBB: I have an army and the Breath of God on my side, Doctor. What'll"
299,you have? 
300,DOCTOR: This. 
301,(His brain.) 
302,COBB: Lock them up and guard them. 
303,CLINE: What about the new soldier? 
304,COBB: Can't trust her. She's from pacifist stock. Take them all. 
305,
306,[Hath camp]
307,
308,(The Hath are celebrating something.) 
309,MARTHA: But I didn't do anything. 
310,(The Hath congratulate her nicely.) 
311,MARTHA: I think I just started a war. 
312,[Cell]
313,
314,"(A large cage, numbered 60120716.) "
315,DONNA: More numbers. They've got to mean something. 
316,DOCTOR: Makes as much sense as the Breath of Life story. 
317,JENNY: You mean that's not true? 
318,"DONNA: No, it's a myth. Isn't it, Doctor? "
319,"DOCTOR: Yes, but there could still be something real in that temple."
320,"Something that's become a myth. A piece of technology, a weapon. "
321,DONNA: So the Source could be a weapon and we've just given directions
322,to Captain Nutjob? 
323,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. "
324,"DONNA: Not good, is it? "
325,"DOCTOR: That's why we need to get out of here, find Martha and stop"
326,"Cobb from slaughtering the Hath. What, what are you, what are you, what"
327,are you staring at? 
328,"JENNY: You keep insisting you're not a soldier, but look at you,"
329,drawing up strategies like a proper general. 
330,"DOCTOR: No, no. I'm trying to stop the fighting. "
331,JENNY: Isn't every soldier? 
332,"DOCTOR: Well, I suppose, but that's, that's. Technically, I haven't got"
333,"time for this. Donna, give me your phone. Time for an upgrade. "
334,JENNY: And now you've got a weapon. 
335,DOCTOR: It's not a weapon. 
336,JENNY: But you're using it to fight back. I'm going to learn so much
337,from you. You are such a soldier. 
338,"DOCTOR: Donna, will you tell her? "
339,"DONNA: Oh, you are speechless. I'm loving this. You keep on, Jenny. "
340,(The Doctor sonics Donna's phone and calls Martha.) 
341,[Hath camp]
342,
343,MARTHA: Doctor? 
344,[Cell]
345,
346,"DOCTOR: Martha, you're alive! "
347,[Hath camp]
348,
349,"MARTHA: Doctor! Oh, am I glad to hear your voice."
350,Are you all right? 
351,[Cell]
352,
353,DOCTOR: I'm with Donna. We're fine. What about you?
354,
355,"DONNA: And, and Jenny. She's fine too. "
356,"DOCTOR: Yes, all right. And, and Jenny. That's the woman from the"
357,"machine. The soldier. My daughter, except she isn't, she's, she's."
358,Anyway. where are you? 
359,[Hath camp]
360,
361,"MARTHA: I'm in the Hath camp. I'm okay, but"
362,something's going on. The Hath are all marching off to some place
363,that's appeared 
364,[Cell]
365,
366,MARTHA : On this map thing. 
367,"DOCTOR: Oh, that was me. If both armies are heading that way, there's"
368,going to be a bloodbath. 
369,[Hath camp]
370,
371,MARTHA: What do you want me to do? 
372,DOCTOR : Just stay where you are. 
373,[Cell]
374,
375,"DOCTOR: If you're safe there, don't move, do you"
376,hear? 
377,MARTHA : But 
378,[Hath camp]
379,
380,MARTHA: I can help. 
381,(Martha's battery goes flat.) 
382,MARTHA: Doctor? Doctor. 
383,[Camp]
384,
385,COBB: The doors that have been closed will be open
386,"to us now. The door to the Temple, to the Source, and to victory. "
387,(Cheers.) 
388,"COBB: Come the dawn cycle, we march. "
389,[Cell]
390,
391,SOLDIERS : To war! 
392,DOCTOR: They're getting ready to move out. We have to get past that
393,guard. 
394,JENNY: I can deal with him. 
395,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. You're not going anywhere. "
396,JENNY: What? 
397,DOCTOR: You belong here with them. 
398,DONNA: She belongs with us. With you. She's your daughter. 
399,DOCTOR: She's a soldier. She came out of that machine. 
400,"DONNA: Oh yes, I know that bit. Listen, have you got that stethoscope?"
401,Give it to me. Come on. 
402,JENNY: What are you doing? 
403,DONNA: It's all right. Just hold still. 
404,(Donna listens to Jenny's chest.) 
405,"DONNA: Come here. Listen, and then tell me where she belongs. "
406,DOCTOR: Two hearts. 
407,DONNA: Exactly. 
408,JENNY: What's going on? 
409,"DONNA: Does that mean she's a, what do you call a female Time Lord? "
410,JENNY: What's a Time Lord? 
411,DOCTOR: It's who I am. It's where I'm from. 
412,JENNY: And I'm from you. 
413,"DOCTOR: You're an echo, that's all. A Time Lord is so much more. A sum"
414,"of knowledge, a code, a shared history, a shared suffering. Only it's"
415,"gone now, all of it. Gone forever. "
416,JENNY: What happened? 
417,DOCTOR: There was a war. 
418,JENNY: Like this one? 
419,DOCTOR: Bigger. Much bigger. 
420,"JENNY: And you fought, and killed? "
421,DOCTOR: Yes. 
422,JENNY: Then how are we different? 
423,[Hath camp]
424,
425,(One Hath has stayed behind with Martha.) 
426,MARTHA: I need to charge it up. I need power. Do you understand? 
427,(The Hath rotates the map into 3 dimensions. The circular Temple now
428,has a pointed roof and goes down a very long way.) 
429,"MARTHA: There's even more? In 3D. Oh, you're a clever Hath. So this is"
430,"where everybody's headed? But look, those tunnels sort of zig-zag. If I"
431,"went up and over the surface in a straight line, I'd get there first. "
432,"(Bubble, bubble.) "
433,MARTHA: Why not? 
434,(He brings up a graph.) 
435,"MARTHA: Are these readings for the surface? Well, it doesn't look too"
436,bad. Nitrogen and oxygen about eighty twenty. That's fine. Ozone levels
437,"are high, and some big radiation spikes. But as long as I'm not out"
438,there too long. 
439,(Bubble.) 
440,MARTHA: I have to find my friends. 
441,(Bubble.) 
442,"MARTHA: Come on, then."
443,
444,[Cell]
445,
446,JENNY: Hey. 
447,CLINE: I'm not supposed to talk to you. I'm on duty. 
448,"JENNY: I know. Guarding me. So, does that mean I'm dangerous, or that I"
449,need protecting? 
450,CLINE: Protecting from what? 
451,"JENNY: Oh, I don't know. Men like you? "
452,(Jenny kisses Cline through the bars whilst taking his pistol.) 
453,JENNY: Keep quiet and open the door. 
454,DONNA: I'd like to see you try that.
455,
456,[Stairs]
457,
458,(There is a guard on the lower flight of metal
459,stairs.) 
460,DOCTOR: That's the way out. 
461,(Jenny raises the pistol.) 
462,DOCTOR: Don't you dare. 
463,DONNA: Let me distract this one. I have picked up a few womanly wiles
464,over the years. 
465,DOCTOR: Let's save your wiles for later. In case of emergency. 
466,"(The Doctor rummages in his coat pockets, and a few moments later a"
467,clockwork mouse grinds to a halt behind the guard. He picks it up and
468,Jenny karate chops him from behind.) 
469,"DOCTOR: I was going to distract him, not clobber him. "
470,"JENNY: Well, it worked, didn't it? "
471,DOCTOR: They must all have a copy of that new map. Just stay there.
472,Don't hurt anyone. 
473,[Staircase]
474,
475,(The Hath start to batter down a doorway as Martha
476,and her friend arrive at a brick-build set of stairs up to a hatch in
477,the roof.) 
478,"MARTHA: You can stay down here and live your whole life in the shadows,"
479,or come with me and stand in the open air. Feel the wind on your face.
480,What's it going to be? It's up to you. But nothing's going to stop me. 
481,[Planet surface]
482,
483,(Martha pushes open the heavy hatch and climbs out
484,"onto a cold, dark, windswept planet lit by the reflected light of three"
485,moons. The Hath follows her.) 
486,MARTHA: I knew you couldn't resist it. 
487,(Bubble.) 
488,"MARTHA: Er, language. Come on. "
489,[Cell]
490,
491,"(Cobb has been tied up with rope, and gagged. A"
492,soldier removes it.) 
493,"CLINE: It was the girl. She tricked me. They, they got away. I'm sorry."
494,
495,COBB: I've waited all my life for this moment. No one's going to get in
496,my way. Certainly not this Doctor. At arms! We march to war. 
497,[Tunnel]
498,
499,(The Doctor checks the map he took from the guard.)
500,
501,DOCTOR: Wait. This is it. The hidden tunnel. There must be a control
502,panel. 
503,DONNA: It's another one of those numbers. They're everywhere. 
504,(60120714.) 
505,DOCTOR: The original builders must have left them. Some old cataloguing
506,system. 
507,"DONNA: You got a pen? Bit of paper? Because, do you see, the numbers"
508,are counting down. This one ends in one four. The prison cell said one
509,six. 
510,"JENNY: Always thinking, both of you. Who are you people? "
511,DOCTOR: I told you. I'm the Doctor. 
512,JENNY: The Doctor. That's it? 
513,DONNA: That's all he ever says. 
514,"JENNY: So, you don't have a name either? Are you an anomaly, too? "
515,DOCTOR: No. 
516,"DONNA: Oh, come off it. You're the most anomalous bloke I've ever met. "
517,(The Doctor gets into the control panel.) 
518,DOCTOR: Here it is. 
519,"JENNY: And Time Lords. What are they for, exactly? "
520,"DOCTOR: For? They're not, they're not for anything. "
521,JENNY: So what do you do? 
522,DOCTOR: I travel through time and space. 
523,"DONNA: He saves planets, rescues civilisations, defeats terrible"
524,"creatures. And runs a lot. Seriously, there's an outrageous amount of"
525,running involved. 
526,(The door opens.) 
527,DOCTOR: Got it! 
528,"COBB : Squad five, with me. "
529,"DOCTOR: Now, what were you saying about running? "
530,[Passageway]
531,
532,(The Doctor stops running just before the array of
533,laser beams criss-crossing the passage.) 
534,"DONNA: That's not mood lighting, is it? "
535,(The Doctor tosses the clockwork mouse into the lasers. It gets
536,disintegrated.) 
537,"DONNA: No, I didn't think so. "
538,DOCTOR: Arming device. 
539,(He works on a blue box nearby.) 
540,"DONNA: There's more of these. Always eight numbers, counting down the"
541,closer we get. 
542,(60120713.) 
543,"DOCTOR: Right, here we go. "
544,DONNA: You'd better be quick. 
545,COBB : Corridor. 
546,JENNY: The General. 
547,DOCTOR: Where are you going? 
548,JENNY: I can hold them up. 
549,"DOCTOR: No, we don't need any more dead. "
550,JENNY: But it's them or us. 
551,DOCTOR: It doesn't mean you have to kill them. 
552,JENNY: I'm trying to save your life. 
553,"DOCTOR: Listen to me. The killing. After a while, it infects you. And"
554,"once it does, you're never rid of it. "
555,JENNY: We don't have a choice. 
556,DOCTOR: We always have a choice. 
557,JENNY: I'm sorry. 
558,DOCTOR: Jenny. 
559,"SOLDIER : This door, now. "
560,(Jenny runs around the corner and readies a machine gun at the
561,approaching voices.) 
562,SOLDIER : There she is. At arms. Fire! 
563,(Jenny exchanges gunfire with Cobb and his soldiers.) 
564,DOCTOR: I told you. Nothing but a soldier. 
565,DONNA: She's trying to help. 
566,(Jenny ducks out of sight to think.) 
567,"DOCTOR : Jenny, come on. "
568,JENNY: I'm coming. 
569,COBB: Cease fire. Cease fire. 
570,(The lasers go out.) 
571,DONNA: That's it. 
572,"DOCTOR: Jenny, leave it! Let's go. "
573,(The Doctor and Donna run down the corridor.) 
574,COBB: You're a child of the machine. You're on my side. Join us. Join
575,"us in the war against the Hath. It's in your blood, girl. Don't deny"
576,it. 
577,"(Jenny stands and takes aim, then shoots a hole in a steam pipe above"
578,Cobb before running back.) 
579,"DOCTOR: Jenny, come on. That's it. "
580,DONNA: Hurry up. 
581,(The lasers reappear.) 
582,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no, no. The circuit's looped back. "
583,DONNA: Zap it back again. 
584,DOCTOR: The controls are back there. 
585,JENNY: They're coming. 
586,"DOCTOR: Wait. Just. There isn't. Jenny, I can't "
587,"JENNY: I'll have to manage on my own. Watch and learn, Father. "
588,(Jenny throws away the weapon and somersaults her way through the laser
589,beams.) 
590,DONNA: No way. But that was impossible. 
591,DOCTOR: Not impossible. Just a bit unlikely. Brilliant! You were
592,brilliant. Brilliant. 
593,"JENNY: I didn't kill him. General Cobb, I could have kill him but I"
594,didn't. You were right. I had a choice. 
595,(Cobb and the soldiers appear at the other side of the lasers. Donna
596,and Jenny run.) 
597,COBB: At arms. 
598,"DOCTOR: I warned you, Cobb. If the Source is a weapon, I'm going to"
599,make sure you never use it. 
600,COBB: One of us is going to die today and it won't be me. 
601,(The Doctor runs away from the hail of bullets.)
602,
603,[Planet surface]
604,
605,(The ground is rough and hard going.) 
606,MARTHA: It can't be much further. 
607,(She falls down a slope and lands with a splash in a bog. The Hoth goes
608,to help her.) 
609,"MARTHA: Help me! I'm sinking. I'm sinking. Help me, Peck. Help me. Help"
610,"me, Peck. I'm sinking. I'm sinking. "
611,"(Hath Peck cannot reach her hand, so he jumps in beside her and pushes"
612,her to solid ground before sinking below the
613,porridge-like surface himself.) 
614,MARTHA: Oh no! No!
615,
616,[Corridor]
617,
618,"JENNY: So, you travel together, but you're not"
619,together? 
620,"DONNA: What? No. No. No way. No, no, we're friends, that's all. I mean,"
621,we're not even the same species. There's probably laws against it. 
622,"JENNY: And what's it like, the travelling? "
623,"DONNA: Oh, never a dull moment. It can be terrifying, brilliant and"
624,"funny, sometimes all at the same time. I've seen some amazing things"
625,though. Whole new worlds. 
626,"JENNY: Oh, I'd love to see new worlds. "
627,"DONNA: You will. Won't she, Doctor? "
628,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
629,DONNA: Do you think Jenny will see any new worlds? 
630,DOCTOR: I suppose so. 
631,JENNY: You mean. You mean you'll take me with you? 
632,"DOCTOR: Well, we can't leave you here, can we? "
633,"JENNY: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. Come on, let's get a move"
634,on. 
635,"DOCTOR: Careful, there might be traps. "
636,"DONNA: Kids. They never listen. Oh, I know that look. I see it a lot"
637,round our way. Blokes with pushchairs and frowns. You've got dad-shock.
638,
639,DOCTOR: Dad-shock? 
640,DONNA: Sudden unexpected fatherhood. Take a bit of getting used to. 
641,"DOCTOR: No, it's not that. "
642,"DONNA: Well, what is it then? Having Jenny in the Tardis, is that it?"
643,What's she
644,"going to do, cramp your style? Like you've got a sports car and she's"
645,going to turn it into a people-carrier? 
646,"DOCTOR: Donna, I've been a father before. "
647,DONNA: What? 
648,"DOCTOR: I lost all that a long time ago, along with everything else. "
649,DONNA: I'm sorry. I didn't know. Why didn't you tell me? You talk all
650,"the time, but you don't say anything. "
651,"DOCTOR: I know. I'm just. When I look at her now, I can see them. The"
652,"hole they left, all the pain that filled it. I just don't know if I can"
653,face that every day. 
654,DONNA: It won't stay like that. She'll help you. We both will. 
655,"DOCTOR: But when they died, that part of me died with them. It'll never"
656,come back. Not now. 
657,"DONNA: I tell you something, Doctor. Something I've never told you"
658,before. I think you're wrong. 
659,(Gunfire. Jenny runs back.) 
660,JENNY: They've blasted through the beams. Time to run again. Love the
661,running. Yeah? 
662,DOCTOR: Love the running. 
663,"(Up on the surface, Martha can see the protruding construction of the"
664,Temple.) 
665,DONNA: We're trapped. 
666,DOCTOR: Can't be. This must be the Temple. This is a door. 
667,(60120712.) 
668,DONNA: And again. We're down to one two now 
669,DOCTOR: I've got it! 
670,JENNY: I can hear them. 
671,DOCTOR: Nearly done. 
672,DONNA: These can't be a cataloguing system. 
673,JENNY: They're getting closer. 
674,DOCTOR: Then get back here. 
675,DONNA: They're too similar. Too familiar. 
676,JENNY: Not yet. 
677,DOCTOR: Now! Got it. 
678,(The Doctor gets the plain door open and they go through. A similar
679,door opens for Martha on the surface.) 
680,JENNY: They're coming. Close the door. 
681,[Spaceship]
682,
683,(The Doctor locks the door.) 
684,"JENNY: Oh, that was close. "
685,DOCTOR: No fun otherwise. 
686,DONNA: It's not what I'd call a temple. 
687,JENNY: It looks more like 
688,DOCTOR: Fusion drive transport. It's a spaceship. 
689,"DONNA: What, the original one? The one the first colonists arrived in? "
690,"DOCTOR: Well, it could be, but the power cells would have run down"
691,after all that time. This one's still powered-up and functioning. Come
692,on. 
693,(They head up a flight of stairs to see someone is cutting their way
694,through another door.) 
695,JENNY: It's the Hath. That door's not going to last much longer. And if
696,"General Cobb gets through down there, war's"
697,going to break out. 
698,"DOCTOR: Look, look, look, look, look. Ship's log. "
699,(The screen says Messaline Leader One mission log designation
700,XG2482942-372.) 
701,DOCTOR: (reads) First wave of Human/Hath co-colonisation of planet
702,Messaline. 
703,(Core subterranean deployment successful. Online and active. Phase one
704,"initiated. Construction drones deployed. Construction of sections 1A,"
705,"1B, 2A, 2B, 3C & 3D complete. Phase one in progress."
706,"Construction drones active. Construction of sections 1C, 1D, 2C, 2D, 3A"
707,& 3C complete.) 
708,JENNY: So it is the original ship. 
709,DONNA: What happened? 
710,"DOCTOR: Phase one, construction. They used robot drones to build the"
711,city. 
712,DONNA: But does it mention the war? 
713,(The Doctor scrolls down through Phase One in progress. Construction of
714,western quadrant complete. Phase two initiated. Commencing colonisation
715,protocol 0.7. Designated pioneer progenation in progress. Mission
716,commander quarantined due to eruption of byzantine fever. Prognosis
717,negative.
718,DOCTOR: Final entry. (reads) Mission commander dead. Still no agreement
719,on who should assume leadership. Hath and humans have divided into
720,factions. That must be it. A power vacuum. The crew divided into two
721,factions and turned on each other. Start using the progenation
722,"machines, suddenly you've got two armies fighting a never-ending war. "
723,JENNY: Two armies who are now both outside. 
724,DONNA: Look at that. 
725,(60120724 on a display above a screen showing the whole planet.) 
726,DOCTOR: It's like the numbers in the tunnels. 
727,"DONNA: No, no, no, no. But listen, I spent six months working as a temp"
728,"in Hounslow Library, and I mastered the Dewey Decimal System in two"
729,days flat. I'm good with numbers. It's staring us in the face. 
730,JENNY: What is? 
731,DONNA: It's the date. Assuming the first two numbers are some big old
732,"space date, then you've got year, month, day. It's the other way round,"
733,like it is in America 
734,DOCTOR: Oh! It's the New Byzantine Calendar. 
735,"DONNA: The codes are completion dates for each section. They finish it,"
736,"they stamp the date on. So the numbers aren't counting down, they're"
737,"going out from here, day by day, as the city got built. "
738,"DOCTOR: Yes. Oh, good work, Donna. "
739,DONNA: Yeah. But you're still not getting it. The first number I saw
740,"back there, was sixty twelve oh seven seventeen. Well, look at the date"
741,today. 
742,DOCTOR: Oh seven twenty four. No. 
743,JENNY: What does it mean? 
744,DOCTOR: Seven days. 
745,DONNA: That's it. Seven days. 
746,DOCTOR: Just seven days. 
747,"JENNY: What do you mean, seven days? "
748,DOCTOR: Seven days since war broke out. 
749,DONNA: This war started seven days ago. Just a week. A week! 
750,JENNY: They said years. 
751,"DONNA: No, they said generations. And if they're all like you, and"
752,they're products of those machines 
753,DOCTOR: They could have twenty generations in a day. Each generation
754,"gets killed in the war, passes on the legend. Oh, Donna, you're a"
755,genius. 
756,"JENNY: But all the buildings, the encampments. They're in ruins. "
757,"DOCTOR: No, they're not ruined. They're just empty. Waiting to be"
758,"populated. Oh, they've mythologised their entire history. The Source"
759,must be part of that too. Come on. 
760,"(Further along, they meet up with Martha for a joyous reunion.) "
761,MARTHA: Doctor! 
762,"DOCTOR: Martha! Oh, I should have known you wouldn't stay away from the"
763,excitement. 
764,MARTHA: Donna. 
765,"DONNA: Oh, you're filthy. What happened?. "
766,"MARTHA: I, er, took the surface route. "
767,COBB : Positions. 
768,DOCTOR: That's the General. We haven't got much time. 
769,DONNA: We don't even know what we're looking for. 
770,"MARTHA: Is it me, or can you smell flowers? "
771,COBB : Maintain defensive positions. 
772,DOCTOR: Yes. Bougainvillea. I say we follow our nose. 
773,"COBB : Squads seven to ten, advance. With me. "
774,[Hydroponics]
775,
776,(It's on a spaceship and it is filled with plants.
777,What else should I call it?) 
778,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Yes. Isn't this brilliant? "
779,(They walk up to a glowing globe on a pedestal with wires running to
780,it. There is a control panel and screen nearby.) 
781,DONNA: Is that the Source? 
782,JENNY: It's beautiful. 
783,MARTHA: What is it? 
784,DOCTOR: Terraforming. It's a third generation terraforming device. 
785,DONNA: So why are we suddenly in Kew Gardens? 
786,"DOCTOR: Because that's what it does. All this, only bigger. Much"
787,bigger. It's in a transit state. Producing all this must help keep it
788,stable before they finally 
789,(The Hath and the soldiers run in from opposite sides.) 
790,DOCTOR: Stop! Hold your fire! 
791,"COBB: What is this, some kind of trap? "
792,DOCTOR: You said you wanted this war over. 
793,COBB: I want this war won. 
794,DOCTOR: You can't win. No one can. You don't even know why you're here.
795,"Your whole history, it's just Chinese whispers, getting more distorted"
796,the more it's passed on. This is the Source. This is what you're
797,fighting over. A device to rejuvenate a planet's ecosystem. It's
798,"nothing mystical. It's from a laboratory, not some creator. It's a"
799,bubble of gases. A cocktail of stuff for accelerated evolution.
800,"Methane, hydrogen, ammonia, amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids. It's"
801,used to make barren planets habitable. Look around you. It's not for
802,"killing, it's bringing life. If you allow it, it can lift you out of"
803,"these dark tunnels and into the bright, bright sunlight. No more"
804,"fighting, no more killing. "
805,(The Doctor takes the globe.) 
806,"DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor, and I declare this war is over. "
807,"(He throws the globe onto the floor, where it smashes and releases gas"
808,"and energy. Everyone watches it slowly rise up, then they start to put"
809,down their weapons. All except Cobb.) 
810,JENNY: What's happening? 
811,DOCTOR: The gases will escape and trigger the terraforming process. 
812,JENNY: What does that mean? 
813,DOCTOR: It means a new world. 
814,JENNY: No! 
815,(Jenny takes the bullet Cobb intends for the Doctor. He lays her on the
816,ground.) 
817,"DOCTOR: Jenny? Jenny. Talk to me, Jenny. "
818,DONNA: Is she going to be all right? 
819,(Martha shakes her head.) 
820,JENNY: A new world. It's beautiful. 
821,"DOCTOR: Jenny, be strong now. You need to hold on, do you hear me?"
822,"We've got things to do, you and me, hey? Hey? We can go anywhere."
823,Everywhere. You choose. 
824,JENNY: That sounds good. 
825,"DOCTOR: You're my daughter, and we've only just got started. You're"
826,going to be great. You're
827,going to be more than great. You're going to be amazing. You hear me?
828,Jenny? 
829,(Jenny dies in the Doctor's arms.) 
830,DOCTOR: Two hearts. Two hearts. She's like me. If we wait. If we just
831,wait. 
832,"MARTHA: There's no sign, Doctor. There is no regeneration. She's like"
833,"you, but maybe not enough. "
834,DOCTOR: No. Too much. That's the truth of it. She was too much like me.
835,
836,"(The Doctor lays Jenny down and kisses her forehead, then goes over to"
837,Cobb. Cline and another soldier are holding his arms and making him
838,kneel. The Doctor picks up the pistol and points it at Cobb's head for
839,a very long time before putting the safety back on.) 
840,DOCTOR: I never would. Have you got that? I never would. When you start
841,"this new world, this world of Human and Hath, remember that. Make the"
842,foundation of this society a man who never would. 
843,[Camp]
844,
845,(Jenny is lying in state when sunlight beings to
846,stream through the stained glass windows.) 
847,MARTHA: It's happening. The terraforming. 
848,"DONNA: Build a city, nice and safe underground, strip away the top soil"
849,and there it is. And what about Jenny? 
850,CLINE: Let us give her a proper ceremony. I think it'd help us. Please.
851,
852,[Tardis]
853,
854,DOCTOR: Jenny was the reason for the Tardis
855,"bringing us here. It just got here too soon, which then created Jenny"
856,in the first place. Paradox. An endless paradox. Time to go home? 
857,MARTHA: Yeah. Home. 
858,[Street]
859,
860,DONNA: Are you sure about this? 
861,"MARTHA: Yeah, positive. I can't do this any more. You'll be the same"
862,one day. 
863,DONNA: Not me. Never. How could I ever go back to normal life after
864,seeing all this? I'm
865,going to travel with that man for ever. 
866,MARTHA: Good luck. 
867,DONNA: And you. 
868,(The Doctor walks on with Martha.) 
869,DOCTOR: We're making a habit of this. 
870,MARTHA: Yeah. And you'd think it'd get easier. All those things you've
871,been ready to die for. I thought for a moment there you'd finally found
872,something worth living for. 
873,"DOCTOR: Oh there's always something worth living for, Martha. "
874,(They hug.) 
875,"MARTHA: Bye, Doctor. "
876,DOCTOR: Goodbye. Doctor Jones. 
877,(Donna and the Doctor walk back to the Tardis. Martha looks at her
878,engagement ring then goes into her home.)

880,[Camp]
881,
882,(Cline and a Hath are putting a pillow under
883,Jenny's head and a sheet over her body when her mouth opens and golden
884,energy comes out. She gasps and her eyes open.) 
885,"JENNY: Hello, boys."
886,
887,[Corridor]
888,
889,CLINE: The shuttle. Jenny? 
890,[Shuttle]
891,
892,CLINE : What're you doing? Come back. 
893,JENNY: Sorry. Can't stop. What you going to do
894,
895,[Corridor]
896,
897,JENNY  Tell my dad? 
898,CLINE: But where are you going? 
899,[Shuttle]
900,
901,"JENNY: Oh, I've got the whole universe. "
902,(The shuttle takes off into the sky.) 
903,"JENNY: Planets to save, civilisations to rescue, creatures to defeat,"
904,and an awful lot of running to do.
