19, [Archeological dig] 
20, (The pyramids of Saqqara are tumbledown piles of
21,"mud bricks compared to those on the Giza plateau. Inside a tomb, a"
22,large stone door is being removed.) 
23,SCARMAN : Gently. Be careful. That's it. 
24,"(A tall, patrician-like man with a wonderful Roman nose enters the"
25,unsealed room with an oil lamp and views its wall paintings.) 
26,SCARMAN: It's perfect. It's absolutely untouched. The reliquaries are
27,"still sealed. Look at this. Great heaven, this tomb must date back to"
28,the First Dynasty of the Pharaohs. How many thousands of years since
29,the priests sealed the inner chamber and draped this tapestry across
30,the entrance? 
31,(He pulls the tapestry aside to reveal a large Eye carved into the
32,stones above a set of cartouches.) 
33,"SCARMAN: Achmed, your lantern, man. Quickly, quickly. It's the Eye of"
34,Horus. 
35,"ACHMED: No, Professor Scarman! "
36,(Achmed calls out in his native tongue as the local workers flee the
37,tomb.) 
38,SCARMAN: Come back! Come back! I need your help! Superstitious savage.
39,I've come too far to turn back now. 
40,(Professor Scarman starts to pry at the stones with a mattock when they
41,"quietly slide open. He enters the inner chamber, a green light hits"
42,"him, then he screams and falls.) "
43, [Tardis] 
44," (The Tardis is in flight, and the Doctor is just"
45,standing still when Sarah enters in an Edwardian dress.) 
46,"SARAH: Hey, Doctor. Doctor, look what I've found. "
47,"DOCTOR: Hello, Vicky. "
48,SARAH: What? 
49,DOCTOR: Hmm? Where did you get that dress? 
50,"SARAH: I just told you. I found it back there in the wardrobe. Why,"
51,don't you like it? 
52,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I always did. Victoria wore it. She travelled with me"
53,for a time. 
54,"SARAH: Well, as long as Albert didn't wear it. Oh, come on, Doctor."
55,"That's worth a smile, surely? What's the matter? You should be glad to"
56,be going home. 
57,"DOCTOR: The Earth isn't my home, Sarah. I'm a Time Lord. "
58,SARAH: I know you're a Time Lord. 
59,DOCTOR: You don't understand the implications. I'm not a human being. I
60,walk in eternity. 
61,SARAH: What's that supposed to mean? 
62,DOCTOR: It means I've lived for something like seven hundred and fifty
63,years. 
64,"SARAH: Oh, you'll soon be middle aged. "
65,DOCTOR: Yes! About time I found something better to do than run around
66,after the Brigadier. 
67,"SARAH: Oh, come on. If you're tired of being UNIT's scientific advisor,"
68,you can always resign. 
69,(Just then the Tardis goes dark and tilts. A console panel explodes
70,then the lights come back on and Sarah sees the image of a strange
71,animal-like skull hanging in the air. It disappears.) 
72,SARAH: What was it? 
73,DOCTOR: The relative continuum stabiliser failed. 
74,"SARAH: No, not that. I mean the thing. "
75,DOCTOR: What thing? 
76,"SARAH: There was a terrible face just for a second, then it was gone."
77,"You don't believe me, do you. "
78,DOCTOR: Nothing can enter the Tardis. Unless 
79,SARAH: Unless what? 
80,"DOCTOR: Mental projection of that force is beyond imagination, yet it"
81,might explain the stabiliser failure. Let's see. Was it at this end of
82,the spectrum? 
83,"SARAH: No, Doctor, don't! Whatever it was, I know it was totally"
84,malevolent. 
85,(Bump.) 
86,DOCTOR: We've landed. 
87,SARAH: Where? Where have we landed? 
88, [Storage room] 
89, (They step out into a room cluttered with painted
90,and gilded sarcophagi and boxes.) 
91,"DOCTOR: We've materialised at the correct point in space, but obviously"
92,not in time. A temporal reverse? Some vast impulse of energy has drawn
93,the Tardis off course. 
94,"SARAH: You're saying this is UNIT HQ, but years before I knew it? "
95,DOCTOR: Yes. 
96,SARAH: But it's so different. It can't be the same house. 
97,DOCTOR: It must be the old priory. The UNIT house was built on the
98,site. 
99,"SARAH: The old priory was burnt down, wasn't it? "
100,DOCTOR: Something's very wrong. 
101,"SARAH: Doctor, I don't like it here. "
102,DOCTOR: Something's going on contrary to the laws of the universe. I
103,must find out what. 
104, [Study] 
105," (Somewhere in the house, someone is playing a"
106,cabinet organ with all the stops out. The butler knocks but is not
107,"heard, so he enters. The Egyptian theme is continued in the gilded and"
108,"coloured decor, a the mummy case on a raised dais. There is also a"
109,desk.) 
110,"COLLINS: Excuse me, sir. "
111,(The man at the organ is wearing a red fez.) 
112,NAMIN: Get out. Get out of here! (he stops playing) How dare you
113,disturb me? Get out. Get out at once! 
114,"COLLINS: I'm sorry, sir, but the gentleman insisted. "
115,NAMIN: Gentleman? What gentleman? 
116,"COLLINS: He's an old friend of Professor Scarman, sir. "
117,"NAMIN: I ordered that no one was to be admitted, Collins. I told you no"
118,callers! 
119,(The gentleman enters.) 
120,"WARLOCK: Don't blame Collins. Forced entry, sir. "
121,NAMIN: This is outrageous. 
122,WARLOCK: Call it what you like. I've a few questions to put to you. 
123,"NAMIN: All right, Collins. "
124,(Collins leaves.) 
125,NAMIN: So you have some questions? 
126,"WARLOCK: My name is Warlock. Doctor Warlock. I live in the village, and"
127,Professor Scarman is my oldest friend. 
128,NAMIN: I am Ibrahim Namin. 
129,WARLOCK: I know your name. It's your business that I am concerned with.
130,"Called at the lodge on my way up. Had a word with Scarman's brother,"
131,Laurence. He tells me you've had the infernal impudence to bar him from
132,this house. 
133,NAMIN: I am acting under instructions from Professor Scarman. 
134,WARLOCK: I don't believe it. 
135,NAMIN: I have his letter of authority. I have brought back from Egypt
136,all the relics discovered by the Professor on his recent expedition. My
137,orders are to store them safely and allow no one admittance to the
138,"Professor himself returns. That is an end to it, Doctor Warlock. "
139,(Namin snatches the letter back from Warlock's hands.) 
140,"WARLOCK: Oh, no, sir. Not by a long chalk! "
141, [Outside the study] 
142, (Collins is eavesdropping.) 
143,"WARLOCK : I came here to find out what's going on, and I'm not"
144,leaving until I do. 
145,(The knob on a door across the hall is rattling.) 
146, (Storage room] 
147, DOCTOR: Why bother to lock an internal door? 
148,SARAH: Maybe this wing of the house isn't in use. It smells musty
149,enough. 
150,"DOCTOR: That isn't all must, Sarah. Some of it's mummy. French"
151,picklock. Never fails. Belonged to Marie Antoinette. Charming lady.
152,"Lost her head, poor thing. "
153,"(Collins starts to unlock the door from the other side, and the Doctor"
154,and Sarah hide until they see who has entered.) 
155,"DOCTOR: Of course, it would make an ideal headquarters for some"
156,paramilitary organisation. This room could easily be turned into a
157,"laboratory. Oh, hello. "
158,COLLINS: Who are you? How did you get in here? 
159,DOCTOR: Through the window. I understood the property was for sale. No?
160,
161,"COLLINS: Ah, you're not fooling me, sir. You came with Doctor Warlock,"
162,didn't you. 
163,DOCTOR: Did we? 
164,COLLINS: He asked you to scout round whilst he kept his nibs busy.
165,"Listen, if you're a friend of Doctor Warlock, sir, tell him to watch"
166,out. 
167,SARAH: Watch out for what? 
168,COLLINS: The Egyptian. There's no knowing what he might do. He's got
169,the temper of the devil himself. 
170,"DOCTOR: Egyptian, eh? Is this where he keeps his relatives? "
171,"COLLINS: It's no joke, sir. He's only been here a few days. I wouldn't"
172,"be staying, but, well, situations aren't easy to find at my age. "
173,DOCTOR: What are you afraid of? 
174,COLLINS: He locked this wing. He didn't know there was a second key. If
175,"he were to find me along here, let alone you two, he'd go stark raving"
176,"mad, sir. "
177,"DOCTOR: I see. In that case, we'd better leave. "
178,"COLLINS: Oh, not this way, sir. Better go the way you came. He might"
179,see you. 
180,DOCTOR: As you wish. 
181,"COLLINS: And remember to tell Doctor Warlock what I said, sir. "
182,DOCTOR: Don't worry. I'll remember. 
183,(The Doctor helps Sarah out of the window and they walk around the
184,"outside of the magnificent Stargrove Manor, Hampshire, ducking down"
185,"under the other windows on their way. Collins watches them go, unaware"
186,of movement in a mummy case behind him.) 
187, [Outside the study window] 
188, WARLOCK : Utter humbug. That letter's a bogus
189,fabrication if ever I saw one. 
190,NAMIN : Are you alleging that it is forged? 
191,"WARLOCK : I am, sir, and I intend to prove it. "
192,"NAMIN : I warn you, Doctor Warlock, do not interfere. "
193,WARLOCK : Are you threatening me? 
194, [Study] 
195, NAMIN: It is not I who threaten. There are ancient
196,powers gathering in this place. Powers beyond the comprehension of
197,unbelievers. 
198,(Namin gazes at a black-faced mummy case.) 
199,"WARLOCK: Ancient balderdash. Now let me warn you, Namin. Unless you"
200,"give me some straight answers, I'm going to the police. "
201,NAMIN: To say what? That a foreigner is living in Professor Scarman's
202,house? 
203,WARLOCK: To say that he's not been seen for weeks. That his baggage is
204,"lying unclaimed in his hotel. Oh, yes, I've had some enquiries made in"
205,Cairo. 
206,(A man screams.) 
207,WARLOCK: What the devil? 
208,(Namin and Warlock run out of the room. The Doctor and Sarah climb in
209,through the window.) 
210, [Storage room] 
211," NAMIN: Open, the fool. "
212,(The mummy case closes just before they enter. Collins is lying by the
213,"window, his face a picture of horror. Warlock examines him.) "
214,WARLOCK: Poor fellow. He's been strangled. 
215,"NAMIN: The gods have returned. I, Ibrahim Namin, servant of the true"
216,"faith, rejoice in their power. "
217,WARLOCK: Get the police. His assailant can't have got far. 
218,"NAMIN: You blind, pathetic fool. The servants of the All Powerful have"
219,"arisen. When the temple is cleansed of all unbelievers, the High One"
220,himself will come among us. This is how it was written. 
221,"WARLOCK: Yes, I see. Well, I still think the police "
222,(Namin has a revolver pointed at Warlock.) 
223,"NAMIN: You should have listened when I told you to leave, Warlock. Now"
224,you have seen too much. You must be the second unbeliever to die. 
225,"(The Doctor lassoes Namin with his scarf just as he fires, and pulls"
226,him to the floor. 
227,"SARAH : Come on, quick. "
228,"(Warlock leaves as the Doctor holds Namin down, then leaves too. Namin"
229,"gets up, straightens his jacket, then opens the mummy case to reveal a"
230,bandaged figure that is not quite human. There is a definite ridge
231,"running down the middle of its face with hollows either side, and the"
232,rib cage is very high and prominent. Namin points a scarab ring at it.)
233,
234,"NAMIN: Abisme, Sutekh. Molachah. T'nab. "
235,(The mummy steps down out of its case.) 
236, [Priory gardens] 
237," (The Doctor is half-carrying Warlock, who was shot"
238,high in the right chest.) 
239,"WARLOCK: It's no good, I can't go much further. "
240,DOCTOR: You must. We're sitting ducks if we stay here. 
241,WARLOCK: Get to the lodge. Tell Laurence 
242,DOCTOR: Laurence? 
243,WARLOCK: Marcus Scarman's brother. He live there. Knows me. 
244,(Warlock collapses.) 
245,"DOCTOR: He needs help, Sarah. You go on ahead, find the lodge. "
246,SARAH: What about you? 
247,DOCTOR: I'll be all right. 
248,SARAH: Okay. 
249,(Sarah runs off up the steps and through the gate while the Doctor
250,"picks up Warlock and carries him, leaving his bowler hat behind.) "
251, [Woods] 
252," (Further on, in a wooded area, Sarah hides in a"
253,hollow as the mummy comes near. Namin finds the bowler hat and follows
254,"the Doctor, revolver at the ready. The mummy leaves and Sarah runs off"
255,and arrives outside the lodge. Now it is the Doctor who is hiding from
256,"the mummy in the hollow. Namin arrives, hears something and turns.) "
257,"NAMIN: The All Powerful descends. O noble god, your servant hears you."
258,"Namin leaves, followed by the mummy. Sarah arrives with Laurence"
259,Scarman.) 
260,"LAURENCE: Oh, my dear chap. Is he badly hurt? "
261,DOCTOR: He'll be all right if we can staunch the bleeding. 
262,LAURENCE: We'd better get him back to the lodge. 
263,"SARAH: Doctor, listen. I saw a mummy. A walking mummy! "
264,"DOCTOR: Mummies are embalmed, eviscerated corpses. They don't walk. "
265,SARAH: But this one did. 
266,DOCTOR: Never mind about that now. 
267,"(Back in the study, Namin prostrates himself before the mummy case then"
268,prays in his own language.) 
269, [Lodge] 
270, (Sarah makes Warlock comfortable on a couch in
271,Scarman's study and covers him with a blanket. His right arm is in a
272,sling.) 
273,WARLOCK: Thank you. 
274,"SARAH: Now, is there anything I can get you? "
275,"WARLOCK: No, no, I'm all right now. "
276,"SARAH: Just try and rest, then. "
277,"LAURENCE: Well, in view of what you've told me, I'm going to fetch the"
278,police. 
279,"DOCTOR: No! This is much too grave a matter for the police, Mister"
280,Scarman. 
281,LAURENCE: Too grave? 
282,DOCTOR: Yes. They'd only hamper my investigation. 
283,LAURENCE: Your investigations? 
284,DOCTOR: Yes. Why do you think I'm here? Something's interfering with
285,"time, Mister Scarman, and time is my business. "
286,LAURENCE: Who are you? 
287,"SARAH: Well, I'm Sarah Jane Smith. I'm a journalist. "
288,LAURENCE: Journalist? Who is your companion? 
289,"SARAH: My companion? Oh, that's just the Doctor. We travel in time,"
290,Mister Scarman. I'm really from 1980. 
291,"LAURENCE: That is utterly preposterous, Miss Smith. "
292,SARAH: Yes. Sorry. 
293,DOCTOR: Interesting contraption. 
294,"LAURENCE: Kindly leave that alone, sir. That apparatus is delicately"
295,"adjusted, and furthermore is a receiver containing highly dangerous"
296,electrical current. 
297,"(It looks like a sort of seismograph to me, complete with wiggly lines"
298,"on paper cylinder, yet with a perforated wheel added.) "
299,"DOCTOR: Yes, so I see. What year is this? "
300,LAURENCE: What year? 
301,"DOCTOR: It's a simple enough question, surely. "
302,LAURENCE: Are you telling me you don't know what 
303,"DOCTOR: If I knew I wouldn't ask. Don't be obtuse, man. "
304,LAURENCE: Nineteen hundred and eleven. 
305,DOCTOR: Ah. Splendid. An excellent year. One of my favourites. Yes. I
306,"really must congratulate you, Mister Scarman. "
307,LAURENCE: On what? 
308,DOCTOR: Inventing the radio telescope forty years early. 
309,"LAURENCE: That, sir, is a Marconiscope. It's purpose "
310,DOCTOR: Is to receive radio emissions from the stars. 
311,LAURENCE: How could you possibly know that? 
312,"DOCTOR: Well, you see, Mister Scarman, I have the advantage of being"
313,"slightly ahead of you. Sometimes behind you, but normally ahead of you."
314,
315,LAURENCE: I see. 
316,"DOCTOR: I'm sure you don't, but it's very nice of you to try. Now, why"
317,don't you show me how this gadget works? 
318,LAURENCE: Do you mean you want me to 
319,DOCTOR: Please. Just a little demonstration. 
320,"(Scarman flicks three switches then pulls down a lever, which connects"
321,the electrical circuit with a spark and cloud of smoke. The wheel
322,begins to spin.) 
323,DOCTOR: Amazing. That's really amazing. 
324,(Scarman disconnects the power but the wheel continues to spin faster
325,and faster.) 
326,LAURENCE: I can't switch it off! 
327,(A large diode explodes and the machine finally dies.) 
328,"SARAH: Oh, very impressive. "
329,LAURENCE: It's never done that before. 
330,DOCTOR: Fascinating. A regular pattern repeated over and over again. 
331,SARAH: Like an SOS? 
332,DOCTOR: I wonder. Where was your aerial tuned? 
333,LAURENCE: Mars. Why? 
334,DOCTOR: I just thought I'd verify the signal. 
335,(The Doctor takes a small radio from his pocket and extends the
336,aerial.) 
337,"LAURENCE: What's that you have, Doctor. "
338,"DOCTOR: Well, in principle it's exactly the same as the gadget you've"
339,"invented, only less cumbersome. Yes, it is the same signal. Obviously"
340,"automatic. Well, if it's a message, it shouldn't be difficult to"
341,decipher. They'd want to make it easy. 
342,(The Doctor starts to make notes in his notebook.) 
343,LAURENCE: Who would? 
344,SARAH: Whoever transmitted it. 
345,"DOCTOR: Now, let's see. This pattern recurs three times in one line."
346,"Let's call that E, the commonest letter in the language. "
347,"(Up at the Priory, Namin is back to belting out dramatic cords on the"
348,cabinet organ as three mummies line up in front of the mummy case. They
349,raise their arms.) 
350,DOCTOR: Beware Sutekh. 
351,SARAH: Sutekh? 
352,DOCTOR: Better known to you as Set? 
353,"SARAH: Of course, Egyptian mythology. Set or Sutekh was one of their"
354,"gods. He was killed by Horus, god of light. "
355,"LAURENCE: Yes, but Egyptology and Mars? "
356,"DOCTOR: If I'm right, the world is facing the greatest peril in its"
357,history. 
358,"SARAH: Hey, wait for me. "
359,DOCTOR: No. The forces that are being summoned into corporeal existence
360,in that house are more powerful and more dangerous than anything even I
361,have ever encountered. Stay here. 
362,LAURENCE: I've an old hunting rifle that might come in useful. 
363,DOCTOR: I never carry firearms. 
364,(The Doctor leaves.) 
365,LAURENCE: What I meant was that I should feel better if I could bring
366,it. 
367,(Sarah is almost out of the door.) 
368,SARAH: Bring it. 
369, [Study] 
370, (The Doctor sneaks into the priory and opens the
371,door to the study a little. The mummy case starts to shimmer with many
372,"colours, and the mummies back away. Namin leaves the organ to play"
373,itself and kneels in front of the case.) 
374,"NAMIN: All high, all powerful, most noble Lord, thy humble servant"
375,welcomes thee. 
376,"(From somewhere beyond, a figure in what might be a black spacesuit"
377,"appears where the case was. Out in the corridor, Sarah enters. The"
378,Doctor gestures her to go away.) 
379,"NAMIN: Master, at last you are here. I, Ibrahim Namin, and all my"
380,forebears have served you faithfully through the thousands of years
381,that you have slept. We have guarded the secret of your tomb.) 
382,"(The figure walks up to Namin, smoke coming from its footsteps. It"
383,speaks very calmly.) 
384,ALIEN: Stand. Look upon my face. 
385,"NAMIN: Great One, Lord Sutekh, I dare not. "
386,ALIEN: Look. 
387,"(The helmet is like the faces of the mummies, only in shining black.) "
388,ALIEN: Is this the face of Sutekh? 
389,"NAMIN: Master, spare me. Spare me. I am a true servant of the great"
390,Sutekh. 
391,ALIEN: I am the servant of Sutekh. He needs no other. 
392,"(Sarah, Scarman and the Doctor watch from the doorway as the alien"
393,places its hands on Namin's shoulders. Namin starts screaming as smoke
394,comes from his skin.) 
395,ALIEN: Die. I bring Sutekh's gift of death to all humanity. 
396, Part Two
397,
398, [Outside the study] 
399," (Namin falls dead onto the floor, and the"
400,black-clad alien transforms into a human male with pale skin and
401,red-ringed eyes.) 
402,LAURENCE: Marcus! 
403,DOCTOR: Shush. 
404, [Study] 
405, SCARMAN: Take up the generator loops. 
406,(The mummies move forward and pick up a set of canopic jars by the
407,mummy case.) 
408,SCARMAN: Place them in position at the compass points. Activate at
409,ground strength. 
410, [Outside the study] 
411," DOCTOR: Quick, hide. "
412,"(The three scatter as the Professor leads the mummies out of the study,"
413,"down the hallway and out of the main door. After a few moments, the"
414,Doctor comes out from behind the potted plants and signals Scarman and
415,Sarah to get out of the travelling trunk.) 
416,SARAH: Where have they gone? 
417,DOCTOR: To set up a deflection field around the house. He's obviously
418,planned every step. 
419,"LAURENCE: Who, Marcus? "
420,"DOCTOR: No, Sutekh. "
421, [Study] 
422, DOCTOR: Sutekh is breaking free from his ancient
423,"bonds. If he succeeds, he'll destroy the whole world. "
424,SARAH: You mean Sutekh is still alive? 
425,"DOCTOR: He destroyed his own planet, Phaester Osiris, and left a trail"
426,of havoc across half the galaxy. Horus and the rest of the Osirans must
427,have finally cornered him on Earth. 
428,SARAH: In Egypt? 
429,DOCTOR: The wars of the gods entered into mythology. The whole of
430,Egyptian culture is founded upon the Osiran pattern. 
431,LAURENCE: I'm afraid this is beyond me. 
432,"SARAH: It's beyond me, too. "
433,DOCTOR: Ah! Found it. 
434,SARAH: What? 
435,DOCTOR: The lodestone that drew the Tardis off course. 
436,"LAURENCE: That's not a lodestone, that's just a sarcophagus. "
437,"DOCTOR: No, it isn't. It's the entrance to a time-space tunnel. "
438,SARAH: Leading where? 
439,DOCTOR: To Sutekh. 
440,(The Doctor activates a cartouche on the case and it starts to do its
441,multicoloured effect. 
442,SARAH: Doctor! 
443,DOCTOR: Keep back! 
444,"(Struggling to avoid being sucked in, the Doctor manages to get a"
445,handkerchief or something out of his waistcoat pocket and throw it into
446,the vortex. There is a bang and he collapses.) 
447, [Woods] 
448, (Night is falling as the local poacher checks his
449,"traps. One snaps shut nearby. He moves forward, shotgun at the ready,"
450,to see a mummy staggering around with the trap firmly attached to its
451,ankle. Finally it kneels down and pries the trap open then casts it
452,"aside. The poacher turns and runs, pausing only to pick up his bag and"
453,a freshly caught rabbit.) 
454, [Study] 
455," SARAH: Doctor! Doctor, come on. Wake up, please. "
456,LAURENCE: It's no good. He took the full force of the blast. 
457,SARAH: They're bound to come back soon. We're trapped! Where are you
458,going? 
459,LAURENCE: There's a priest hole here somewhere. Marcus and I discovered
460,it when we were boys. 
461,(A piece of ornate wood panelling springs open.) 
462,"LAURENCE: There. It isn't very large, I'm afraid. "
463,"SARAH: No, well, he is though, so come and give me a hand. "
464, [Woods] 
465," (Out in the woods, the fleeing poacher runs"
466,straight into an invisible wall and falls flat on his back. He gets up
467,"and tests it again, then tries throwing a branch at it. It bounces"
468,off.) 
469,CLEMENTS: Holy Moses. 
470,"(He gathers up his bag of game and his shotgun, and makes off back the"
471,way he came.) 
472, [Lodge] 
473," WARLOCK: Is that you, Laurence? "
474,(A pale figure enters.) 
475,"WARLOCK: Marcus! Marcus, my dear fellow, you're back. "
476,SCARMAN: Why are you here? 
477,"WARLOCK: Huh? What's the matter? For goodness sakes, old chap, don't"
478,you recognise me? 
479,SCARMAN: Warlock. 
480,WARLOCK: That's right. We've all been dreadfully worried about you. 
481,SCARMAN: I came to find the other Scarman. 
482,"WARLOCK: The other? You mean your brother, Laurence? "
483,SCARMAN: The human. 
484,"WARLOCK: Look here, old chap. If this is some kind of macabre joke? "
485,"SCARMAN: Where is the other Scarman, Warlock? "
486,WARLOCK: Laurence went up to the house. That Egyptian servant of yours
487,took a potshot at me! Laurence and the Doctor and some very plucky
488,young girl went off to deal with the brute. They've been gone a devil
489,"of a time, mind you. I hope nothing's amiss. "
490,SCARMAN: Who is the Doctor? 
491,"WARLOCK: One of Laurence's friends, I imagine. Some sort of scientist. "
492,SCARMAN: Why does he interfere? 
493,"WARLOCK: Interfere? Now look here, Marcus "
494,SCARMAN: All humans inside the deflection barrier will be destroyed. 
495,"WARLOCK: For heaven's sake, Marcus, what's wrong with you? "
496,(A mummy enters.) 
497,SCARMAN: Destroy this human. 
498,"WARLOCK: No, no, no! Laurence! Laurence! No! "
499, [Outside the lodge] 
500, (Warlock's screams are clearly heard.) 
501,CLEMENTS: Murdering swine. 
502,(He runs into the trees. Marcus and the mummy leave. Clements loads his
503,shotgun and carefully stalks them along the carriageway.) 
504, [Priest's hole] 
505, SARAH: He's coming round. 
506,DOCTOR: A parallax coil. 
507,LAURENCE: What? 
508,DOCTOR: I never expected that. A simple trap. Blew up in my face.
509,Clever. 
510,LAURENCE: He's delirious. 
511,"SARAH: No, shush. "
512,DOCTOR: Never underestimate Sutekh. Thinks of everything. 
513,(The Doctor finally opens his eyes.) 
514,DOCTOR: Where are we? 
515,SARAH: Hiding. 
516,DOCTOR: Where? 
517,LAURENCE: A priest hole. 
518,DOCTOR: In a Victorian gothic folly? Nonsense. 
519,SARAH: You're so pedantic at a time like this. Does it matter? 
520,DOCTOR: If only I knew the exact physical location of Sutekh. Where was
521,your brother's expedition bound? 
522,"LAURENCE: Saqqara, I think. He wrote to say he'd discovered a blind"
523,pyramid in that region and believed it contained a mastaba. 
524,SARAH: What? 
525,LAURENCE: An underground burial chamber. 
526,"DOCTOR: Saqqara. Too vague, yet it might be our only chance. "
527,SARAH: To do what? 
528,DOCTOR: Sutekh is controlling operations here by mental force. With the
529,"equipment at the lodge, I could transmit a jamming signal. "
530,SARAH: And block his power? 
531,DOCTOR: With an etheric impulse projected along precisely the right
532,"axis, yes. Otherwise "
533,SARAH: No good. 
534,DOCTOR: The Egyptian's ring! 
535,LAURENCE: What? 
536,DOCTOR: It's a slave relay. Calculating the reverse polarisation should
537,be child's play. Why didn't I think of it? 
538,SARAH: Shush. Listen. 
539, [Study] 
540, SCARMAN: Remove this carcass. (sniffs) There are
541,other humans within these walls. Seek and kill them. 
542,(The mummies drag Namin away.) 
543, [Priest's hole] 
544, SARAH: He's coming over. 
545,"(Through the window, Clements sees Marcus moving his hands over the"
546,"panelling, and lets him have both barrels in the back.) "
547,LAURENCE: Marcus! 
548, [Study] 
549, (Marcus reabsorbs the gunshot smoke and walks over
550,to the broken window.) 
551,CLEMENTS: Professor Scarman! 
552,(Clements drops his shotgun and runs.) 
553,SCARMAN: Seek and kill. 
554,(Two mummies set off across the lawn after Clements. Scarman leaves the
555,study. Our three come out of hiding.) 
556,"DOCTOR: All right, all clear. "
557,LAURENCE: Where are we going? 
558,DOCTOR: Shush. To find that Egyptian. 
559, [Outside the study] 
560, SARAH: We can't search the whole priory. There's
561,no need to. Look. 
562,(Footsteps and drag marks in the dust on the floor into the locked
563,wing.) 
564, [Storeroom] 
565, (Some definitely non-Egyptian items are taken from
566,packing cases.) 
567,SCARMAN: Follow me. 
568,"(He leads the mummies out and past the hidden trio, who then enter the"
569,room. Namin is lying on the floor. The Doctor removes the scarab ring.)
570,
571,SARAH: What do you think they're doing? 
572,DOCTOR: I'm not sure yet. 
573,"LAURENCE: This is exceedingly interesting, Doctor. It appears to be"
574,some kind of machinery. 
575,"DOCTOR: You're right. Yes, that's resonating tuner. Part of an"
576,anti-gravity drive. Oh! They must be building a rocket. 
577,SARAH: Egyptian mummies building rockets? That's crazy. 
578,"DOCTOR: They're not mummies, they're service robots. "
579,SARAH: Huh? 
580,DOCTOR: Machines. 
581,"SARAH: Machines? All right then, why are machines building rockets? "
582,DOCTOR: So that Sutekh can escape from the power of Horus. 
583,SARAH: Where's Sutekh now? 
584,DOCTOR: Exactly where Horus left him seven thousand years ago. Trapped
585,beneath a pyramid and powerless to move. 
586,(A door slams and they run out to hide. Laurence cocks his hunting
587,"rifle, then the Doctor pulls him back behind a tapestry.) "
588,(Marcus Scarman enters with the mummies to collect more pieces of
589,machinery.) 
590, [Tardis] 
591, LAURENCE: Great heavens! This is unbelievable.
592,Totally unbelievable! 
593,DOCTOR: You're going to say it transcends all the normal laws of
594,physics. 
595,"LAURENCE: I am, yes. I mean, it does. It's preposterous! "
596,DOCTOR: Isn't it. I often think dimensional transcendentalism is
597,"preposterous, but it works. Would you like to look around? "
598,LAURENCE: May I? 
599,DOCTOR: Please. 
600,"SARAH: Well now we are here, why don't you tune up 1980 and we can,"
601,"well, leave. "
602,DOCTOR: I can't. 
603,SARAH: Ah. Why can't you? 
604,"DOCTOR: Because if Sutekh isn't stopped, he'll destroy the world. "
605,"SARAH: But he didn't, did he. I mean, we know the world didn't end in"
606,1911. 
607,DOCTOR: Do we? 
608,"SARAH: Yes, of course we do! "
609,"DOCTOR: All right. If we leave now, let's see what the world will look"
610,like in 1980. 
611,(The Doctor works the console.) 
612,"LAURENCE: I say, this is like something by that novelist chap, Mister"
613,Wells. 
614,"(The Tardis lands, and the doors open to show a bleak, rocky landscape"
615,with howling winds and an electrical storm.) 
616,"DOCTOR: 1980, Sarah, if you want to get off. "
617,"(Sarah doesn't, and the doors close.) "
618,SARAH: It's a trick! 
619,DOCTOR: No. That's the world as Sutekh would leave it. A desolate
620,planet circling a dead sun. 
621,SARAH: It can't be! I'm from 1980. 
622,"DOCTOR: Every point in time has its alternative, Sarah. You've looked"
623,into alternative time. 
624,"LAURENCE: Fascinating. Do you mean the future can be chosen, Doctor? "
625,"DOCTOR: Not chosen, shaped. The actions of the present fashion the"
626,future. 
627,LAURENCE: So a man can change the course of history? 
628,DOCTOR: To a small extent. It takes a being of Sutekh's almost
629,limitless power to destroy the future. Well? 
630,SARAH: We've got to go back. 
631,DOCTOR: Yes. 
632,"(Out in the woods, an exhausted Clements is hiding behind a tree"
633,"catching his breath, while two mummies stand looking around. He makes a"
634,"break for it, and they lumber after him. Further on, he falls, and they"
635,"catch up to him. Meanwhile, Laurence and Sarah have climbed out of the"
636,storeroom window.) 
637,DOCTOR: Keep below the level of the window. 
638,"(They leave, then the Doctor climbs out.) "
639, [Study] 
640, (Marcus is reporting in via the mummy case.) 
641,SCARMAN: Three humans within the deflection barrier have been
642,destroyed. There are others. 
643,SUTEKH : Eliminate them. 
644,"SCARMAN: The servicers are searching for them, but assembly of the"
645,rocket is being delayed. 
646,SUTEKH : Destruction of the humans must not be allowed to delay the
647,completion of the missile. That is of paramount importance. 
648,"SCARMAN: Your orders will be executed, Sutekh. I will recall two of the"
649,servicers to the rocket assembly. 
650, [Lodge] 
651, (Sarah covers Warlock's face with the blanket.) 
652,LAURENCE: I can't believe that my brother. He and Doctor Warlock were
653,the closest of friends. 
654,"DOCTOR: Well, if you can stop thinking of him as your brother it'll"
655,make it a great deal easier for you. 
656,LAURENCE: But he is my brother! 
657,DOCTOR: From the moment he entered Sutekh's tomb he became subject to
658,Sutekh's will. 
659,LAURENCE: What does that mean? 
660,"DOCTOR: As a human being, Marcus Scarman no longer exists. He is simply"
661,the embodiment of Sutekh's power. He's given the paralysed Sutekh arms
662,"and legs, a means to escape. "
663,"SARAH: If Sutekh is so totally evil, why didn't Horus and the other"
664,Osirans destroy him? 
665,DOCTOR: It's against their code. To have killed him would have meant
666,"that they were no better than he, so they simply imprisoned him. "
667,(The Doctor sets about mending the Marconiscope.) 
668,SARAH: How? 
669,"DOCTOR: A forcefield, controlled from a power source on Mars. "
670,LAURENCE: Mars? 
671,"DOCTOR: Yes. That's where the signal was beamed from, remember? "
672,LAURENCE: But how? 
673,"DOCTOR: When your brother stumbled into Sutekh's tomb, the monitoring"
674,system on Mars detected the fact and triggered off an alarm signal. 
675,SARAH: The rocket those robots are building! 
676,DOCTOR: Yes. Will be aimed at the power source on Mars. If those
677,"warheads reach their target, Sutekh will have released himself. "
678,LAURENCE: To destroy the world. 
679,DOCTOR: Not only this world. Anywhere that life is found. Right. All I
680,need now is a magneto. 
681,LAURENCE: A magneto. Of course. 
682,(Scarman goes to a cupboard.) 
683,SARAH: What are you going to do? 
684,"DOCTOR: If I can block the mental beam, Scarman will collapse. "
685,SARAH: You mean die? 
686,"DOCTOR: Well, he's not alive now in any real sense. Only Sutekh"
687,"animates him. Deprived of his outside contact, Sutekh'll be as"
688,powerless as the day Horus left him. 
689,"LAURENCE: Here you are, Doctor. "
690,DOCTOR: Splendid. 
691,(A man screams outside.) 
692,LAURENCE: What was that? 
693,(The two mummies have caught up with Clements outside the lodge and are
694,now crushing him between their torsos. Scarman takes his rifle and
695,shoots at them. The Doctor goes out and drags Laurence back
696,indoors.) 
697,"DOCTOR: Quick, Sarah, switch on the power. "
698,"LAURENCE: No, no, you'll destroy my brother! "
699,"(Laurence grabs Sarah, but she elbows him in the kidneys and gets"
700,away.) 
701,DOCTOR: Switch on! 
702,(Sarah throws down the switch and the wheel spins.) 
703, [Sutekh's tomb] 
704," (On the monitor, Marcus doubles up in pain.) "
705,SUTEKH: Stop them! 
706, [Lodge] 
707, (The mummies burst through the front door. They
708,"knock the Doctor down and push Scarman aside onto Warlock's corpse,"
709,then advance on Sarah.) 
710,SARAH: Doctor! Doctor! 
711,(One of them grabs her by the throat.) 
712,SARAH: Doctor! Doctor! 
713, Part Three
714,
715, [Lodge] 
716, (The mummy holding Sarah's throat brings its other
717,arm down and hits the Marconiscope. There's a big bang and it starts
718,"flailing around, letting her go, before stopping working.) "
719,"DOCTOR: The ring, Sarah. Use the ring! "
720,(Sarah grabs the ring from the table.) 
721,SARAH: Stop! 
722,(The second mummy stops.) 
723,DOCTOR: Return to control. 
724,SARAH: Return to control! Return to control! 
725,(The mummy leaves.) 
726,DOCTOR: Are you all right? 
727,"LAURENCE: Yes, I think so. "
728,DOCTOR: You don't deserve to be. You nearly got us all killed. 
729,LAURENCE: I'm sorry. 
730,"DOCTOR: What's worse, you've probably wrecked what was my only chance"
731,of stopping Sutekh. 
732,"LAURENCE: Look, forgive me, Doctor. I was thinking of my brother. "
733,DOCTOR: Listen! What's walking about out there is no longer your
734,brother. It is simply an animated human cadaver. Animated by Sutekh. Do
735,you understand? (Laurence nods.) And if Sutekh succeeds in freeing
736,"himself, the consequences will be incalculable. Stay here! "
737,(The Doctor leaves. Sarah runs to follow but Laurence grabs her arm.) 
738,LAURENCE: Where's he going? 
739,SARAH: To find out what Scarman's doing. 
740,(Sarah runs after the Doctor.) 
741, [Study] 
742, SUTEKH : It was a deliberate attempt to block
743,my cytronic control. 
744,"SCARMAN: I know nothing, Master. "
745, [Sutekh's tomb] 
746," (We get our first proper look at this being,"
747,"seated on a stone throne Egyptian style, and wearing a mask.) "
748,SUTEKH: I detected electromagnetic radiation. The source was within the
749,deflection barrier. 
750,SCARMAN : There are some humans here who have eluded the
751,"servicers. If work on the missile is delayed, they can be found and"
752,destroyed. 
753,SUTEKH: No! The missile must be projected at the hour appointed. My
754,"freedom comes before all. Immediately thereafter, you will find and"
755,kill the humans. 
756,"SCARMAN : As you direct, Master, so it shall be. "
757, [Stable courtyard] 
758, (The Doctor goes through the old carriage gateway
759,"into a courtyard, and sees the three mummies by a white shiny pyramid"
760,on a black base. It is about fifteen feet high. Sarah sneaks up behind
761,him.) 
762,SARAH: What is it? 
763,"DOCTOR: It's an Osiran war missile, and almost complete by the look of"
764,it. 
765,SARAH: You mean that thing can fly? 
766,DOCTOR: It transposes with its projection. Pyramid power. 
767,(Marcus enters the courtyard.) 
768,DOCTOR: Back. 
769, [Lodge] 
770, (Laurence is looking at an old photograph of
771,himself and Marcus as schoolboys at Eton. The Doctor enters) 
772,LAURENCE: Did you find out anything? 
773,(The Doctor goes to the inactive mummy.) 
774,SARAH: Only that time is short. 
775,DOCTOR: Cytronic induction. 
776,SARAH: Huh? 
777,DOCTOR: The robots are drawing their energy from a cytronic particle
778,accelerator which must be in Sutekh's tomb. 
779,SARAH: So? 
780,"DOCTOR: So, put that out of action and he'd have no workforce. "
781,SARAH: And no missile. 
782,LAURENCE: But Sutekh's tomb is in Egypt. 
783,DOCTOR: Scarman came here through the time-space tunnel. It's a two-way
784,mechanism. 
785,"SARAH: But if you go through it, Sutekh'll kill you! "
786,LAURENCE: Wouldn't it be better 
787,"DOCTOR: No, it wouldn't. If I go after Sutekh, Sutekh will kill me. The"
788,missiles are aimed. Wouldn't what be better? 
789,LAURENCE: Wouldn't it be less risky simply to blow up the projectile? 
790,DOCTOR: With what? 
791,LAURENCE: Blasting gelignite. 
792,DOCTOR: Do you have some? 
793,"LAURENCE: No, but I believe Clements had a store. "
794,DOCTOR: Clements? 
795,LAURENCE: The poacher. I heard him fishing only a few nights ago. 
796,DOCTOR: Where did he keep it? 
797,LAURENCE: I'm told he had a hut on the other side of the wood. 
798,"DOCTOR: Let's go, Sarah. "
799,SARAH: Right. 
800,LAURENCE: Shall I show you the way? 
801,"DOCTOR: No, we'll find it. "
802,"LAURENCE: You think I'll let you down again, don't you. "
803,"DOCTOR: Mister Scarman, if you want to help, start getting the bindings"
804,off that robot. 
805, [Woods] 
806, DOCTOR: Careful. Walking into a deflection barrier
807,is like walking into a brick wall. 
808,(The Doctor holds a long stick out in front of them.) 
809,SARAH: Painful. 
810,(Boing.) 
811,DOCTOR: Ah. There we are. Now all we've got to do is find the door. 
812,(He turns left and walks along with the stick against the barrier. The
813,beeps get faster then stop.) 
814,DOCTOR: Door. 
815,"(A jackal headed canopic jar is in the leaf litter, humming to itself."
816,The Doctor gets out his sonic screwdriver.) 
817,DOCTOR: Key. 
818,SARAH: As simple as that? 
819,"DOCTOR: No, not really. "
820,"SARAH: No, I didn't think it could be. "
821,DOCTOR: No obvious booby traps. Are you going to help or are you just
822,going to stand there and admire the scenery? 
823,SARAH: Your shoes need repairing. I actually wasn't admiring the
824,scenery. I was waiting for you to tell me what to do. 
825,DOCTOR: Just hold the base. I don't want it to fall. 
826,SARAH: Dangerous? 
827,DOCTOR: Very dangerous. 
828,(Sarah supports the base of the jar as the Doctor cranks up the
829,screwdriver. There is a loud noise and he backs off.) 
830,DOCTOR: Deactivating a generator loop without the correct key is like
831,repairing a watch with a hammer and chisel. One false move and you'll
832,never know the time again. 
833,SARAH: Any more comforting thoughts? 
834,DOCTOR: Yes. Just let me know if it starts to get warm. 
835,SARAH: Don't worry. You'll hear me breaking the sound barrier. 
836, [Sutekh's tomb] 
837, (A simple display on the monitor shows the
838,position of one of the jars flickering.) 
839,SUTEKH: Interference. Interference! 
840, [Woods] 
841, (The Doctor puts away the screwdriver and gently
842,turns the lid of the jar before lifting it off. He removes a slim
843,"silver canister from inside and unscrews the bottom, which has"
844,"electronics inside, then puts it in his pocket.) "
845,DOCTOR: Just to make sure. Come on. 
846, [Study] 
847," SCARMAN: Master, I do not understand how this can"
848,be. 
849,SUTEKH : The barrier to the east has been deactivated. 
850, [Sutekh's tomb] 
851, SCARMAN : But that is not possible. 
852,SUTEKH: It has been deactivated. The power line has gone from my
853,monitor. 
854,SCARMAN : The humans do not have the knowledge to shut down
855,the deflection barrier. 
856, [Study] 
857, SUTEKH : It is clear that an extraterrestrial
858,intelligence is operating. 
859,SCARMAN: An alien? 
860,"SUTEKH : Oh, I have endured an eternity of darkness and impotence."
861,I shall not be denied now. Listen to my orders. 
862,"SCARMAN: I hear you, Master. "
863,SUTEKH : The missile must be guarded. Two servicers must maintain
864,constant vigilance. 
865,SCARMAN: It shall be as you say. 
866, [Sutekh's tomb] 
867," SUTEKH: Once the missile is projected, you will"
868,"seek out and destroy my enemies. The alien who dares to intrude, the"
869,"humans, animals, birds, fish, reptiles. All life is my enemy! All life"
870,shall perish under the reign of Sutekh the Destroyer! 
871,SCARMAN : Only Sutekh shall live! 
872, [Outside the poacher's hut] 
873," SARAH: Just how powerful is Sutekh, Doctor? "
874,"DOCTOR: He's all-powerful. If he ever gets free, there isn't a lifeform"
875,in the galaxy that could stand against him. 
876,"SARAH: What, not even your lot, the Time Lords? "
877,DOCTOR: Not even our lot. 
878, [Poacher's hut] 
879," (The Doctor undoes the chain and padlock, and"
880,enters.) 
881,DOCTOR: Sutekh was only defeated in the end by the combined might of
882,seven hundred and forty of his fellow Osirans led by Horus. 
883,SARAH: The seven hundred and forty gods whose names were recorded in
884,the tomb of Tutmoses the Third. 
885,DOCTOR: Could be. 
886,(Sarah opens a hutch to search it.) 
887,"DOCTOR: I wouldn't do that, if I were you. Could be a ferret. "
888,SARAH: Argh! 
889,"(She snatches her hand out again. Meanwhile, back at the Lodge,"
890,Laurence Scarman has unwrapped the mummy and revealed its wire
891,framework over a basic skeleton. Sarah finds a box on an upper shelf.) 
892,SARAH: This looks like it. 
893,(She throws it down to the Doctor.) 
894,DOCTOR: Ah! 
895,SARAH: What's the matter? Not enough? 
896,DOCTOR: Sweaty gelignite is highly unstable. One good sneeze could set
897,it off. 
898,(He carefully puts the box on the floor.) 
899,SARAH: Sorry. 
900,DOCTOR: No sign of any detonators or fuses? 
901,"SARAH: No, no, nothing else. Perhaps he sneezed? "
902, [Lodge] 
903, (Marcus Scarman has found the deactivated jar in
904,the woods and continued his search for the vandal. He sees the
905,unwrapped robot lying on the carpet. Laurence enters from washing his
906,hands.) 
907,LAURENCE: Marcus! Marcus? Don't you know me? I'm your brother. 
908,SCARMAN: Brother? 
909,"LAURENCE: Your brother, Laurence. "
910,SCARMAN: As Horus was brother to Sutekh. 
911,"LAURENCE: Marcus, you're ill. Let me help you. Trust me. "
912,SCARMAN: Trust you? 
913,LAURENCE: Look. You and I when we were boys. 
914,(Scarman shows Marcus the photograph.) 
915,SCARMAN: Laurence and Marcus. 
916,LAURENCE: That's right. You do remember! 
917,SCARMAN: I was Marcus. 
918,"LAURENCE: You still are. Now, let me help you. "
919,SCARMAN: No! I am Sutekh! 
920,"LAURENCE: No, no. You went to Egypt and fell under some sort of"
921,"mesmeric influence, that's all. "
922,"SCARMAN: Sutekh the great Destroyer. Sutekh, the Lord of Death. I am"
923,his instrument. 
924,"LAURENCE: Now that's all nonsense. You are Marcus Scarman, Professor of"
925,"Archaeology, Fellow of All Souls, Member of the Royal Society. "
926,(Marcus knocks the photograph out of Laurence's hands.) 
927,SCARMAN: What do you know of Sutekh? Where are the others? 
928,LAURENCE: Others? 
929,SCARMAN: You are being helped. Sutekh has detected an alien
930,intelligence amongst the humans here. 
931,LAURENCE: Do you mean the Doctor? 
932,SCARMAN: Doctor? 
933,(Marcus grabs Laurence's arms with superhuman strength.) 
934,"LAURENCE: Marcus, your hands. "
935,SCARMAN: What is he? What is he? 
936,"LAURENCE: Marcus, please. "
937, [Carriage gateway] 
938, (The Doctor carefully hides the gelignite behind
939,an old wooden door while Sarah peers into the courtyard proper. Three
940,mummies guard the pyramid.) 
941,DOCTOR: (sotto) It should be safe there for the moment. 
942,"SARAH (sotto): Look, this isn't going to work. You've got no"
943,"detonators, no fuses, so even if you manage to place the charge without"
944,"being spotted, how do we explode it? "
945,DOCTOR: I don't know yet. 
946, [Lodge] 
947, (Scarman is apparently resting in a rocking chair
948,when the Doctor and Sarah enter.) 
949,"DOCTOR: Oh, well done, Mister Scarman. "
950,SARAH: Mister Scarman? Hey. 
951,"(Sarah shakes Laurence Scarman's shoulder, and he falls to the floor.) "
952,SARAH: Oh! Doctor. 
953,DOCTOR: Strangled. 
954,SARAH: The mummies. 
955,DOCTOR: Not this time. There are marks. His late brother must have
956,called. 
957,SARAH: That's horrible! He was so concerned about his brother. 
958,DOCTOR: I told him not to be. I told him it was too late. 
959,SARAH: Oh! Sometimes you don't seem 
960,DOCTOR: Human? Typical Osiran simplicity. 
961,SARAH: A man has just been murdered! 
962,"DOCTOR: Four men, Sarah. Five, if you include Professor Scarman"
963,"himself, and they're merely the first of millions unless Sutekh is"
964,stopped. Know thine enemy. Admirable advice. 
965,SARAH: Yes. 
966,"DOCTOR: If we're going to do anything about that missile, we're going"
967,to have to move quickly. I'll need your help. 
968,(The Doctor gathers up the mummy's wrappings.) 
969,SARAH: What do you want me to do? 
970,DOCTOR: These bindings are chemically impregnated to protect the robots
971,"against damage and corrosion. An impenetrable disguise, wouldn't you"
972,say? 
973, [Storeroom] 
974, (Two mummies take a piece of equipment from a
975,packing case.) 
976,"SCARMAN: Stop. Warhead trigger charge, phase one. This must be placed"
977,directly under the detonation head. Signify your understanding. 
978,(The mummies bow.) 
979,SCARMAN: Continue. 
980, [Lodge] 
981, (Sarah is finishing wrapping the Doctor's thigh.) 
982,DOCTOR: Hurry up. 
983,SARAH: I am hurrying. 
984,DOCTOR: It doesn't have to be perfect. I shall mingle with the mummies
985,but I shan't linger. 
986,"SARAH: Okay, that'll have to do. "
987,DOCTOR: How do I look? 
988,SARAH: It must have been a nasty accident. 
989,DOCTOR: Don't provoke me. Come on. And don't forget the rifle. 
990, [Study] 
991," (Marcus enters, stands in front of the mummy case"
992,and raises his arms. The stripes of the headdress begin to flicker.) 
993,"SCARMAN: The task is almost completed, Master. We need now only the"
994,target coordinates. 
995, [Sutekh's tomb] 
996, SUTEKH: At last. The coordinates for the pyramid
997,of Mars. I release them. 
998,(A two foot long metal cylinder travels along the time-space tunnel and
999,ends up steaming on the carpet. Marcus picks it up.) 
1000,SUTEKH: Engage the coordinates in the projection dome monitor. 
1001,"SCARMAN : Immediately, Master. "
1002, [Carriage gateway] 
1003, (The mummy that is the Doctor gestures for Sarah
1004,to take the gelignite from its hiding place. She hands the box to him.)
1005,
1006,DOCTOR: You know what to do? 
1007,"SARAH: Yeah. Give you time to get clear, then pow. "
1008,(Sarah starts to load the rifle.) 
1009,DOCTOR: Make sure you shoot straight. You won't get a second shot. 
1010,SARAH: Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. 
1011, [Stable courtyard] 
1012, (The Doctor takes the long way round to the stable
1013,courtyard while Sarah watches from the doorway. He walks straight up
1014,the ramp to the pyramid and puts the box down. Sarah takes aim then
1015,puts the rifle down as Marcus enters.) 
1016,SCARMAN: Stop. 
1017,"(The Doctor hesitates, then takes another step.) "
1018,SCARMAN: Stop! Turn about. Is your relay damaged? This is the
1019,coordinate selector. It is to be placed in the projection dome monitor.
1020,Indicate your understanding. 
1021,(The Doctor bows slightly.) 
1022,SCARMAN: Then obey your order. 
1023,(The Doctor takes the cylinder and walks up the pyramid ramp. Marcus
1024,leaves and a mummy follows him as the Doctor puts the cylinder inside
1025,the pyramid and comes straight out again to walk away in the direction
1026,"he originally entered. Sarah takes up position, aims and fires. The"
1027,"gelignite starts to explode, stops, and reverses.) "
1028,SARAH: I hit it. I know I hit it. 
1029,DOCTOR: You did. Sutekh is containing the explosion. 
1030,SARAH: How? 
1031,DOCTOR: Mental power. There's only one hope left. I've got to get to
1032,"him, break his concentration. "
1033, [Study] 
1034," SCARMAN: I hear you, Master. "
1035,"(The Doctor, back in his normal clothes, appears in the doorway.) "
1036,SUTEKH : (straining) On the missile loading ramp. A crude
1037,detonation device. It must be removed immediately. 
1038,SCARMAN: Another human attempt to prevent your return? They will be
1039,caught and punished. 
1040,"(The Doctor enters and walks to the windows, then hides behind the"
1041,curtains.) 
1042,SUTEKH : The device! I cannot hold back the exothermic reaction for
1043,many minutes. It is taking an intense toll of available energy. Attend
1044,to the device first! 
1045,"SCARMAN: It will be done immediately, Master. "
1046,(Marcus leaves and the Doctor comes out of hiding. He goes up the steps
1047,"to the mummy case, kneels down and reaches over to it. The time space"
1048,tunnel appears. The Doctor stands up and travels along it.) 
1049, [Stable courtyard] 
1050, SCARMAN: That device on the ramp. Remove it. 
1051,(Marcus leaves. A mummy goes to the ramp. 
1052, [Sutekh's tomb] 
1053, (The Doctor appears in the antechamber. He starts
1054,"to move the tapestry aside, then wipes green slime off his fingers,"
1055,before finally entering the main chamber.) 
1056,"DOCTOR: (sotto) Sutekh, last of the Osirans. "
1057,"(Sutekh turns, and, with his concentration broken, the pyramid in the"
1058,courtyard blows up like a sequence from Thunderbirds. It is shown on
1059,Sutekh's monitor. The eyes in Sutekh's mask glow green and the Doctor
1060,is pinned against the wall of the tomb.) 
1061,DOCTOR: Argh! 
1062, Part Four
1063,
1064, [Sutekh's tomb] 
1065, (Sutekh releases the Doctor.) 
1066,"SUTEKH: No, you will not die yet. Identify yourself. "
1067,"DOCTOR: Just destroy me, Sutekh. Nothing else now is left within your"
1068,power. 
1069,SUTEKH: Identify yourself. It is within my power to choose the manner
1070,of your death. 
1071,"(The eyes glow green again, and the Doctor clutches his head in pain.) "
1072,"SUTEKH: I can, if I choose, keep you alive for centuries, racked by the"
1073,most excruciating pain. Since your interference has condemned me for
1074,"ever to remain a prisoner in the Eye of Horus, it would be a fitting"
1075,end. You would make an amusing diversion. 
1076,(The Doctor is released again.) 
1077,"SUTEKH: Identify yourself, plaything of Sutekh. "
1078,DOCTOR: I'm a traveller. 
1079,SUTEKH: From where? 
1080,"DOCTOR: Gallifrey, in the constellation of Kasterborus. "
1081,SUTEKH: Names mean nothing. What is the binary location from galactic
1082,zero centre? 
1083,"DOCTOR: Ten zero eleven, zero zero by zero two. "
1084,SUTEKH: I know the planet. Data retrieval. 
1085,(A four small panels light up.) 
1086,"SUTEKH: So, you are a Time Lord. "
1087,DOCTOR: I renounced the society of the Time Lords. Now I'm simply a
1088,traveller. 
1089,SUTEKH: In time and space. In time and space? 
1090,(He does the green eyes thing.) 
1091,DOCTOR: (screaming) Yes! Yes! 
1092,"SUTEKH: Ah. Approach closer. What are you called, Time Lord? "
1093,DOCTOR: Doctor. 
1094,"SUTEKH: I offer you an alliance, Doctor. Serve me truly, and an empire"
1095,can be yours. 
1096,"DOCTOR: Serve you, Sutekh? Your name is abominated in every civilised"
1097,"world, whether that name be Set, Satan, Sodos "
1098,"SUTEKH: Serve me, Doctor. "
1099,DOCTOR: Never! Argh! 
1100,SUTEKH: You pit your puny will against mine? Kneel! 
1101,DOCTOR: No! 
1102,SUTEKH: Kneel before the might of Sutekh. 
1103,(The Doctor is forced to his knees.) 
1104,"SUTEKH: In my presence, you are an ant, a termite. Abase yourself, you"
1105,grovelling insect. 
1106,(The monitor lights up.) 
1107,"SUTEKH: Well, speak. "
1108,"SCARMAN : Sutekh, great Master, the servicers have found"
1109,one of the humans responsible for the destruction of the missile. 
1110,"SUTEKH: Their leader is my prisoner, Scarman. I have no interest in the"
1111,humans. 
1112,SCARMAN : Then this one can be destroyed. 
1113,(Marcus moves aside to reveal a mummy carrying an unconscious Sarah
1114,under one arm.) 
1115,DOCTOR: Sarah! 
1116,SUTEKH: Kill it immediately. 
1117, [Study] 
1118, DOCTOR : No! No! 
1119,SUTEKH : Wait. 
1120,(A second mummy stops before it brings its hand down on Sarah's exposed
1121,neck.) 
1122,"SUTEKH : Keep the human alive, Scarman. It may have some use. "
1123,"SCARMAN: As you command, Great One, so it shall be. "
1124,(Sarah is dropped to the carpet.) 
1125, [Sutekh's tomb] 
1126, SUTEKH: You are a Time Lord. What interest have
1127,you in humans? 
1128,"DOCTOR: All sapient lifeforms are our kith, Sutekh. "
1129,SUTEKH: Horus held that view. I refute it. 
1130,DOCTOR: Because you fear that other intelligent lifeforms may grow to
1131,"rival you in power, so you kill all life wherever you find it. "
1132,"SUTEKH: Your argument is a cloud, but I see through it into your mind."
1133,"The human girl. Ah, she travels with you. "
1134,(The Tardis is on the monitor.) 
1135,"DOCTOR: If you can do that by mental force, Sutekh, then nothing can be"
1136,beyond you. 
1137,"SUTEKH: Nothing, except to free myself from the Eye of Horus. "
1138,DOCTOR: You use your powers for evil. 
1139,SUTEKH: Evil? Your evil is my good. I am Sutekh the Destroyer. Where I
1140,tread I leave nothing but dust and darkness. I find that good. 
1141,"DOCTOR: Then I curse you, Sutekh, in the name of all nature. You are a"
1142,twisted abhorrence. Argh! 
1143,"SUTEKH: Any further insolence, Doctor, and I shall shred your nervous"
1144,system into a million fibres. Is that understood? 
1145,(The Tardis key and chain are lifted from the Doctor's waistcoat and
1146,hang in the air before Sutekh.) 
1147,SUTEKH: Scarman. 
1148, [Study] 
1149, (Sarah is awake now.) 
1150,"SCARMAN: I hear you, Master. "
1151,SUTEKH : My enemies have brought the means of my deliverance. 
1152,(The time space passage opens.) 
1153,SARAH: The Tardis key! 
1154,SUTEKH : This allows you entry into the Time Lord's space machine.
1155,Take one servicer and travel to the pyramid of Mars. 
1156, [Sutekh's tomb] 
1157," DOCTOR: He won't find that possible, Sutekh. "
1158,SUTEKH: Scarman is my puppet. My mind is in his. 
1159,DOCTOR: The controls of the Tardis are isomorphic. 
1160,SUTEKH: One to one. They answer to you alone. 
1161,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1162,SUTEKH: Then I was wise to spare you. My mind is in yours! 
1163,"(The Doctor's face goes blank, and he stands up then crosses his arms"
1164,over his chest.) 
1165,DOCTOR: Master. 
1166,SUTEKH: Scarman? 
1167, [Study] 
1168, SCARMAN: Master. 
1169,SUTEKH : I send you the Time Lord. He will control the machine. The
1170,human girl will accompany you. If the Time Lord shows the slightest
1171,"sign of self-will, kill her immediately. "
1172,"SCARMAN: It is understood, Great One. "
1173,(The Doctor enters through the passage.) 
1174,"SARAH: Doctor, what's happened? "
1175,SCARMAN: Stand back. 
1176,(A mummy puts its hand on Sarah's shoulder and she winces.) 
1177,"SCARMAN: He is possessed by the Great One. Whom do you serve, Time"
1178,Lord? 
1179,DOCTOR: Sutekh. 
1180,SCARMAN: Who holds all life in his hands? 
1181,DOCTOR: Sutekh. 
1182,SCARMAN: Who is the bringer of death? 
1183,DOCTOR: Sutekh! 
1184,SCARMAN: Venerate his name and obey him in all things. 
1185,DOCTOR: Sutekh is supreme. 
1186,SARAH: No. 
1187,"SCARMAN: Control is established, Great One. "
1188,SUTEKH : It is well. But the Time Lords are a perfidious species.
1189,Dispose of him when you reach the pyramid of Mars. 
1190,SCARMAN: It shall be done. Come. 
1191, [Tardis] 
1192, (Marcus hands the key to the Doctor and he enters.
1193,"Sarah is pushed in after him, then Marcus and the two mummies. With his"
1194,"eyes rolled upwards all the time, the Doctor closes the doors. The"
1195,Tardis dematerialises. 
1196, [Pyramid of Mars] 
1197," (The Tardis materialises in a chamber, and Marcus"
1198,comes out.) 
1199,SUTEKH : My reading indicates an antechamber under the main
1200,pyramid. Seek the control centre. 
1201,(Marcus finds the hidden doorway in the wall.) 
1202,SCARMAN: Sutekh has no further need for the Time Lord. Destroy him. 
1203,SARAH: No! 
1204,(A mummy puts its hands around the Doctor's throat and strangles him.) 
1205,SCARMAN: Come. 
1206,(Marcus and the mummy enter the control centre.) 
1207,SARAH: Doctor. 
1208,"(She listens for his hearts, then starts to cry on his chest. The"
1209,Doctor taps her head.) 
1210,SARAH: Ah! 
1211,DOCTOR: You're soaking my shirt. 
1212,"SARAH: Oh, you're alive! "
1213,DOCTOR: Respiratory bypass system. Useful in a tight squeeze. Where are
1214,we? 
1215,"SARAH: Er, pyramid of Mars. "
1216,DOCTOR: Of course. Sutekh sent Scarman here to deactivate the pyramid.
1217,Where is he? 
1218,SARAH: I thought you'd become a zombie like Scarman. 
1219,"DOCTOR: Sutekh didn't need me any more, so he relaxed his grip. Now,"
1220,did you see where Scarman went? 
1221,SARAH: Through that door. It's vanished! 
1222,DOCTOR: It can't have vanished. It's just not visible. 
1223,SARAH: Same difference. 
1224,DOCTOR: Scarman must be stopped. Somehow he must be stopped. 
1225, [Antechamber] 
1226, (Swirling red energy is visible on columns to the
1227,right. Marcus reaches for a control panel on the wall by another
1228,doorway.) 
1229,SUTEKH [OC: Stay! I sense danger. That relay switch is a power
1230,conductor terminal. Scan. 
1231,(Marcus moves sideways along the wall.) 
1232,SUTEKH : The bulkhead release will be concealed. 
1233,(Marcus waves his hands over the wall next to the doorway.) 
1234,SUTEKH [OC}: There. 
1235,(A small panel turns round in the wall.) 
1236,SUTEKH : Now. 
1237,"(The door opens, and Marcus and the mummy go through.) "
1238, [Pyramid of Mars] 
1239, (The Doctor opens the door.) 
1240,SARAH: Tribophysics. 
1241,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1242, [Antechamber] 
1243, (The Doctor nearly touches the obvious control
1244,panel.) 
1245,DOCTOR: Oh. 
1246,SARAH: What are you waiting for? 
1247,DOCTOR: That's too obvious. 
1248,SARAH: What is? 
1249,DOCTOR: That is. 
1250,"SARAH: Well, a door handle usually is. "
1251,DOCTOR: Not in a jail. Horus would have laid traps for the unwary. 
1252,SARAH: I thought Horus was one of the good guys. 
1253,"DOCTOR: He was an Osiran, with all their guile and ingenuity. Ah. "
1254,(The Doctor finds the hidden door release.) 
1255,DOCTOR: They had dome-shaped heads and cerebrums like spiral
1256,staircases. Come on. 
1257,"(In a second chamber, the Doctor uses a radio aerial to test one 'door"
1258,"handle', which turns out to be electrified. The second one is still"
1259,revealed from where Marcus found it.) 
1260, [Another chamber] 
1261, (Marcus is in front of a panel covered in eight
1262,"rows of five squares, each with a black quadrilateral in it.) "
1263,SUTEKH : Stand back and scan. 
1264,(Marcus moves left to a similar panel with coloured parallel lines in
1265,place of the blocks. The doorway is in between.) 
1266, [Sutekh's tomb] 
1267, SUTEKH: Horus. Think you can confound Sutekh with
1268,these childish stratagems? 
1269,(He overlays the two panels on his monitor.) 
1270, [Another chamber] 
1271, SUTEKH : The floor is charged with explosives.
1272,Count to the fifth row up. Extreme right solenoid. 
1273,(The vertical black oblong.) 
1274,SUTEKH : Press. 
1275,"(Sarah and the Doctor nearly enter, but the mummy starts to turn round"
1276,and they walk out of sight again.) 
1277,SCARMAN: Come. 
1278,"(Marcus and the mummy leave, the Doctor and Sarah enter.) "
1279,SARAH: It's like a Chinese puzzle. 
1280,DOCTOR: Yes. And there's a key. 
1281,"SARAH: Oh, some key. Do you know what it means? "
1282,DOCTOR: Yes. Obviously the length of the lines provide a scale of
1283,measurement. 
1284,SARAH: It reminds me of  City of
1285,the Exxilons. 
1286,DOCTOR: Don't touch anything. 
1287,SARAH: I wasn't going to. 
1288,"DOCTOR: Well, don't. One false move and we could be blown to perdition."
1289,"Feet and inches one side, metres and centimetres the other. Let's see. "
1290,(The Doctor uses his scarf as a measuring tape on the lines.) 
1291,"DOCTOR: A hundred and twenty point three centimetres, multiplied by the"
1292,binary figure ten zero zero. That's a hundred and sixty two point four
1293,"centimetres, correct? "
1294,SARAH: Show-off. 
1295,DOCTOR: Hundred and sixty two point four. That's about seven stitches. 
1296,(He measures up the blocks and moves Sarah behind him.) 
1297,DOCTOR: In case I'm wrong. 
1298,(He pushes the oblong.) 
1299,DOCTOR: I'm right. 
1300, [Junction] 
1301, SARAH: Which way now? 
1302,"(The Doctor explores briefly, and returns to find Sarah trapped in a"
1303,large perspex cylinder.) 
1304,DOCTOR: A dexadron crucible! 
1305,(Sarah is shouting but no sound is coming out.) 
1306,DOCTOR: Keep calm! Keep calm. (sotto) Poor Sarah. I should never have
1307,brought you hear. 
1308, [Sutekh's tomb] 
1309," (On the monitor, Marcus stands in front of a"
1310,doorway.) 
1311,SUTEKH: The inner chamber. The control centre of the pyramid. Make the
1312,"sign of the Eye, Scarman. The sign of the Eye. "
1313,"(Marcus crosses his arms, palms outwards, uncrosses them and turns his"
1314,palms down then reaches down and forward. The door opens. 
1315, [Junction] 
1316, (Sarah's prison is steaming up on the outside. The
1317,Doctor writes RELAX in it.) 
1318,DOCTOR: I can't do it. I can't do it. 
1319,"HORUS : Intruders, you face the twin guardians of Horus. One is"
1320,"programmed to deceive, the other points truly. "
1321,"(Two mummies with gold detailing have appeared, along with two red"
1322,buttons on the bottom of the tube.) 
1323,HORUS : The two switches control your fate. Instant freedom or
1324,"instant death. Before you choose, you can ask one guardian one"
1325,question. This is the riddle of the Osirans. Which is the guardian of
1326,life? 
1327,DOCTOR: Which indeed. They're both contra-programmed so that one will
1328,always give a false indication. One question. If I were to ask your
1329,"fellow guardian the question, which switch would he indicate? "
1330,(The mummy raises an arm towards the nearest button.) 
1331,"DOCTOR: I see. So if you're the true guardian, that must be the death"
1332,"switch. And if you're the automatic liar, you'd be trying to mislead"
1333,"me, so that still must be the death switch. Therefore, this has to be"
1334,the one we want. 
1335,"(The Doctor touches the second button, and the tube and mummies"
1336,vanish.) 
1337,DOCTOR: Come on! Come on! 
1338, [Control centre] 
1339, (A giant red egg sits pulsing in a lotus flower
1340,stand.) 
1341,"SUTEKH : At last, the Eye of Horus! Destroy! Destroy! "
1342,(A Horus guardian steps forward.) 
1343,SCARMAN: Stand back. Deactivate. 
1344,HORUS : My servitors obey only the voice of Horus. Drive out the
1345,intruders. 
1346,(The two mummies battle. Marcus turns into a green-eyed jackal headed
1347,entity.) 
1348,SUTEKH: Destroy! Destroy! 
1349,(The egg explodes as the Doctor and Sarah enter.) 
1350,SUTEKH: Free! 
1351,(Marcus's own head returns.) 
1352,SCARMAN: I'm free! Free at last! 
1353,(Marcus collapses and turns quickly into pile of dust.) 
1354,SARAH: He's won. Sutekh's won! 
1355,"(Behind them, all the doors slide open to reveal the Tardis.) "
1356,DOCTOR: No! The time factor! 
1357,SARAH: What? 
1358,"DOCTOR: Come on, run! "
1359,SARAH: Doctor! 
1360, [Sutekh's tomb] 
1361," SUTEKH: I have won my freedom, Horus. Your curse"
1362,is lifted. Now begins the reign of Sutekh the Destroyer. I shall crush
1363,"this miserable world, and hurl it into the outermost depths of space."
1364,My vengeance starts here! 
1365,(The Tardis leaves Mars and materialises back in the store room. The
1366,"Doctor runs out, carrying a piece of equipment, and Sarah follows him.)"
1367,
1368,"SUTEKH: My paralysis has left me. I can move again. I can move! Now,"
1369,"Horus, we shall see who rules the cosmos! "
1370,(Sutekh's mask disappears.) 
1371, [Study] 
1372, (The Doctor fastens two wires to the mummy case
1373,and puts his device on the floor in front of it. The tunnel activates.)
1374,
1375,DOCTOR: We've got about twenty seconds. Here he comes. 
1376,"(Sutekh travels along the tunnel, but does not come out of the end.) "
1377,SUTEKH: Who dares to interfere? 
1378,"DOCTOR: You're caught in a temporal trap, Sutekh. "
1379,SUTEKH: Time Lord! I shall destroy you. I shall destroy you! 
1380,"DOCTOR: How long do Osirans live, Sutekh? "
1381,SUTEKH: Release me! 
1382,DOCTOR: Never. You're caught in the corridor of eternity. 
1383,"SUTEKH: Release me, insect, or I shall destroy the cosmos! "
1384,"DOCTOR: You're a thousand years beyond the twentieth century now,"
1385,Sutekh. Go on for another ten thousand. 
1386,SUTEKH: I'll spare the planet Earth. I'll give it to you as a
1387,plaything. Release me! 
1388,(Sutekh starts to disappear along the passage.) 
1389,"DOCTOR: No, Sutekh. The time of the Osirans is long past. "
1390,SUTEKH: No! 
1391,DOCTOR: Go. He lived about seven thousand years. 
1392,SARAH: He's dead. Sutekh is dead. 
1393,DOCTOR: At last. 
1394,"SARAH: Look, I know that's the time control from the Tardis, but what"
1395,did you do? 
1396,DOCTOR: I moved the threshold of the time space tunnel into the far
1397,"future. He could never have reached the end. After the Eye was broken,"
1398,I realised that we had little more than two minutes to get back here. 
1399,SARAH: But how? 
1400,DOCTOR: The time radio waves take to pass from Mars to Earth. 
1401,SARAH: Ah. So the Eye of Horus was still holding Sutekh for two minutes
1402,after it was broken. 
1403,"DOCTOR: Yes. You know, the Egyptians called him the Typhonian beast. "
1404,(Boom!) 
1405,SARAH: Doctor! 
1406,(Flames and smoke come from the mummy case.) 
1407,DOCTOR: That was careless of me. I forgot the thermal balance would
1408,equalise. 
1409,"SARAH: Listen, this priory was burnt to the ground, remember? "
1410,DOCTOR: Yes. Perhaps it is time we were leaving. We don't want to be
1411,"blamed for starting a fire, do we? "
1412,SARAH: No. 
1413,DOCTOR: I had enough of that in 1666. 
1414,SARAH: What? 
1415, [Storeroom] 
1416, (Flames blow out the study bay windows as the
1417,Doctor and Sarah get back to the Tardis.) 
1418,"DOCTOR: Come on, come on. "
1419,(They go inside and dematerialise as flames engulf the whole building.)
