17,  (The
18,Tardis materialises over the edge of a small cliff and begins to
19,wobble)
20,
21,[Tardis]
22,
23," DOCTOR: There we are, safely down. "
24,"IAN: What's that movement, Doctor? "
25,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
26,"IAN: Well, surely you can feel it? "
27,DOCTOR: What movement? 
28,BARBARA: Doctor! What's happening? 
29,(they all sway from side to side) 
30,"IAN: Take off again, Doctor! "
31,"DOCTOR: Hold on, hold on, hold on! "
32,(Everyone gets thrown to the floor as the Tardis finally loses it's
33,balance and tumbles over) 
34, Episode One - The
35,Slave Traders 
36, (Time has passed and the Tardis is overgrown.)
37,
38,[Villa]
39,
40,"(Ian is in a toga, reclining, and eating a bunch of"
41,"grapes. The Doctor is also in local garb, watering a pot plant) "
42,"DOCTOR: So you're awake at last, young man. "
43,"IAN: No need to say it like that, Doctor. I thought the whole idea of"
44,us coming here was that we should all have a nice rest. 
45,"DOCTOR: My dear boy, there's a great deal of difference between resting"
46,"and being sort of, bone idle! "
47,"IAN: Well, have a grape. "
48,"DOCTOR: No, thank you, I've had my breakfast. "
49,IAN: Where are Barbara and Vicki? They gone down to the village? Don't
50,"you think that plant's had enough water, Doctor? "
51,"DOCTOR: The answer, dear boy, is pipes. "
52,IAN: Pipes? 
53,"DOCTOR: Pipes, Chesterton, pipes! "
54,IAN: Oh. 
55,"DOCTOR: You see, the Romans, unfortunately, didn't know how to"
56,transport water satisfactorily. That's why they built their aqueducts.
57,"Now, if they'd experimented with pipes. "
58,"IAN: Oh, I see what you're getting at, yes. "
59,"DOCTOR: Good, good, yes, yes, they have. "
60,IAN: I beg your pardon? 
61,"DOCTOR: Oh, my dear young man, why do you let your mind wander so? You"
62,asked me just now if Barbara and Vicki had gone down to the village. I
63,"gave you a plain and simple answer. Yes, they have."
64,
65,[Road]
66,
67,(Vicki is full of energy and picking plants. The
68,road is very smooth and well paved) 
69,"VICKI: Come on, Barbara. "
70,"BARBARA: Oh, Vicki, there's no need to be in such a hurry. The village"
71,"isn't going to run away. Phew, its so hot. "
72,VICKI: It's just that I want to get there before the market closes. 
73,"BARBARA: All right, we'll get there, but not so fast. "
74,(Barbara sits on a convenient bench) 
75,"VICKI: Oh, come on. Honestly, you're getting as bad as Ian. "
76,"BARBARA: Oh, what's that supposed to mean? "
77,"VICKI: Well, the way you spoke I thought we were going to have"
78,adventures and see things. We've been here nearly a month and all
79,everyone wants to do is sit around and rest. 
80,"BARBARA: Oh, Vicki. Look, the adventures come without us looking for"
81,them. And you're finding out what it was like to live in Roman times. 
82,"VICKI: Oh, yes, in one little village miles away from Rome. "
83,"(in the bushes, a man unsheathes his dagger) "
84,"VICKI : How much longer do you think the Doctor will stay here,"
85,Barbara? 
86,"BARBARA : Oh, I've no idea. You can never tell with the Doctor. You"
87,just have to wait and see. 
88,VICKI : What are you going to buy at the market?
89,
90,[Village market]
91,
92, (A white-haired man is playing a lyre as two men
93,with heavy cloaks look around the bustling market) 
94,"DIDIUS: (a small man with a beard) This is too small a place,"
95,Sevcheria. I can't see us finding what we want here. 
96,"SEVCHERIA: (bigger, with a deep voice) It's our last chance before"
97,Rome. 
98,DIDIUS: Why? We pass through much bigger towns. 
99,"SEVCHERIA: Yes, and with legal representation. If we raid them, the"
100,repercussions will put us out of business. 
101,DIDIUS: Then let's go back. 
102,"SEVCHERIA: Didius, the slaves we've already brought from Gaul are in no"
103,"condition for further travel, and the quality is such we shall have to"
104,take far below the market price as it is. 
105,"(Barbara and Vicki arrive, and get noticed) "
106,"DIDIUS: The two women. Yes, very suitable, I agree. I doubt even the"
107,possibility. 
108,"SEVCHERIA: It will do no harm to make enquiries, Didius. "
109,"VICKI: This would make a nice dress. Don't you think so, Barbara? "
110,BARBARA: Are you any good at dressmaking? 
111,"VICKI: No, but I thought you might be. "
112,"BARBARA: Oh, I see. Well, what sort of style would you like? "
113,VICKI: I don't know. What were the fashions like when you left London? 
114,BARBARA: London? Never heard of it. 
115,VICKI: But you told me that that's where you came from. 
116,"BARBARA: Ah, you mean Londinium. When in Rome? "
117,SELLER: (a woman) Can I help you? 
118,"VICKI: Yes, how much is this, please? "
119,"SELLER: Well, now, what would you consider to be a fair price? Bearing"
120,in mind it's the only length of its kind and the finest quality
121,available. 
122,"VICKI: Yes, I know but how much are you asking? "
123,"SELLER: Well, its very difficult to put a price on something like this."
124,It's very hard to come by. 
125,"BARBARA: Yes, I'm sure it is. We'll think about it and come back later."
126,
127,"SELLER: Hey, one moment, please! "
128,"VICKI: Barbara, please, can't we buy it? "
129,BARBARA: You should have learned by now that the price is much fairer
130,when you're not so eager to buy. 
131,VICKI: What? Can we go back and buy it now? 
132,"BARBARA: No, not just yet. "
133,SEVCHERIA: Good day to you. A fine selection. 
134,SELLER: None finer this side of Rome. 
135,"SEVCHERIA: No, thank you. My friend and I are not interested in buying"
136,cloth today. We are buying information. 
137,DIDIUS: The two who were just here. Do you know them? 
138,"SELLER: By sight, not name. "
139,DIDIUS: But they do live here? 
140,SELLER: Yes. They moved into a villa just north of the town about a
141,"month ago. The owner, Flavius Guiscard is away campaigning in Gaul. We"
142,reckon they're friends of his looking after the house. 
143,SEVCHERIA: How many of them are there? 
144,(coins change hands) 
145,SELLER: Four. There are two men with them. 
146,DIDIUS: Young? 
147,(more coins) 
148,SELLER: One of them is. They sell the produce of the gardens to the
149,townsfolk here. Very cheaply too. They must be fools. 
150,SEVCHERIA: But you've no idea where they come from? 
151,"SELLER: None. At least, not until today. (coin) One of the women"
152,"mentioned a town. Londinium, I think she said. Do you know it? "
153,SEVCHERIA: Thank you. You have been most helpful. 
154,DIDIUS: The town they spoke of is in a place they call Britannia. 
155,SEVCHERIA: They are Britons. Perfect.

160,"ruffian who was hiding in the bushes, and killed)"

163,
164," DOCTOR: Wonderful feast, my dear. I don't know"
165,when I've enjoyed a meal more. What was it? 
166,"BARBARA: Well, the main course was breast of peacock. "
167,IAN: Delicious. 
168,BARBARA: With an orange and juniper sauce. 
169,"DOCTOR: Oh, exquisite. "
170,BARBARA: Garnished with larks tongues and baked pomegranates 
171,"DOCTOR: Oh, fabulous, my dear, absolutely fabulous. What was it we had"
172,"before, the sort of hors d'oeuvres, so to speak? "
173,VICKI: That isn't its name. French isn't invented yet. 
174,"DOCTOR: Tut, tut, tut, tut child. Barbara, what was it? Hmm? "
175,BARBARA: Ant's eggs in hibiscus honey. 
176,"DOCTOR: Oh, absolutely. What did you say? "
177,"IAN: Ant's eggs, Doctor. "
178,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's what I thought she said. Ant's eggs. What do you"
179,"think I am, a goldfish, hmm? "
180,"IAN: Doctor, there's one thing I wanted to ask you. "
181,"DOCTOR: Well, go ahead my boy. "
182,"IAN: Now, er, what about the Tardis? "
183,"DOCTOR: Well, what about it, hmm? "
184,"IAN: Well, don't you think we ought to go and have a look at it? "
185,"DOCTOR: Oh, so you want to move on, do you? "
186,IAN: Move on? Certainly not. I'd like to stay here as long as possible.
187,
188,"DOCTOR: Good, that's settled. Settled. Fine. "
189,"BARBARA: All the same, Doctor, I know what Ian means. It's been three"
190,or four weeks since we left the Tardis. 
191,"IAN: Yes, it's not even the right way up. "
192,DOCTOR: How many times do I have to tell you that the Tardis is quite
193,safe where it is. It can take off from any angle. I've never known such
194,"a pair of worriers. Really. Good heavens, I can't wait to get away for"
195,a couple of days from you. You keep on and on and on and on and on.
196,"Gracious me, really. "
197,(the Doctor leaves) 
198,IAN: Going away? Do you know anything about this? 
199,BARBARA: No. Not a thing. 
200,IAN: Vicki? 
201,"VICKI: No, he hasn't said anything to me. Can't say I blame him though."
202,
203,BARBARA: Blame him for what? 
204,"VICKI: Well, its all right living here, but its boring! No wonder he"
205,gets irritable. 
206,"IAN: Ha. That's got nothing to do with living here, believe me. Doctor?"
207,You there? 
208,(The Doctor re-enters and fills a bag with food from the table) 
209,"DOCTOR: Well, I think these should last me two or three days, hmm? "
210,IAN: You never told us you were going away. 
211,"DOCTOR: Oh? Well, I don't know that I was under any obligation to"
212,"report my movements to you, Chesterfield. "
213,BARBARA: Chesterton. 
214,"DOCTOR: Oh, Barbara's calling you. "
215,"VICKI: Where are you going, Doctor? "
216,"DOCTOR: To Rome, my child. "
217,"VICKI: Oh, can I come with you? I won't be any trouble, I promise. Can"
218,I? 
219,"DOCTOR: Well, I. "
220,VICKI: Please? 
221,"DOCTOR: Hmm. Very well, then, very well, "
222,"IAN: Well, perhaps we'd all better come with you to Rome. "
223,"DOCTOR: But my dear chap, you just turned down my invitation. "
224,IAN: I did? 
225,"DOCTOR: Yes, you said how glad you would be to stay here as long as"
226,possible. 
227,"BARBARA: Oh no, Doctor, that was before we knew your plans. Don't you"
228,think it would be safer if Ian and I 
229,"DOCTOR: What is this, what is this now? I know what you're insinuating."
230,"Yes, that I'm not capable of taking care of myself, ay? Huh! Safer"
231,"indeed. Afraid to let me out of your sight, are you? Want to be my"
232,"nursemaids? Well now, let me tell me something. I won't stand for it."
233,"Indeed, I will not stand for it. You want to go to Rome? Go. Go"
234,yourselves. 
235,"VICKI: Doctor, if you feel that "
236,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course, my dear, come along. Let's set about our"
237,"packing, shall we? Come on, then. Yes, you know, this is going to be"
238,"your first exploration. You know, I think you'll like Rome. Rome is"
239,"fascinating, most interesting. I remember once when I was there and I"
240,spoke to 
241,(Doctor and Vicki leave) 
242,"BARBARA: Well, I certainly said the wrong thing. "
243,"IAN: Oh, don't worry, Barbara. Anything you'd said would have been"
244,wrong. 
245,BARBARA: I suppose we're lucky really to have kept him inactive as long
246,as we have. 
247,"IAN: True, true. Still, he can say what he likes. He's enjoyed this"
248,rest as much as any of us. 
249,(Barbara is gazing at him) 
250,IAN: What's the matter? My slip showing? 
251,"BARBARA: No, I was just thinking what a splendid looking Roman you"
252,make. 
253,"IAN: Oh. Well, yes, if I wasn't so modest, I'd agree with you. "
254,BARBARA: It's a pity there's just one thing out of place. 
255,"IAN: Oh, where? "
256,BARBARA: That hair. 
257,IAN: Hmm? 
258,BARBARA: It just doesn't go with those clothes. 
259,"IAN: Oh, yes, I know that but I "
260,BARBARA: Come and sit down. 
261,IAN: Ay? 
262,BARBARA: Come and sit down. 
263,(She gets a comb with very long teeth out of a bag) 
264,"IAN: Now just a minute, Barbara. "
265,"BARBARA: It won't hurt, I got it in the market specially. "
266,"IAN: Yes, but which market? (he falls off the seat) Ow! "
267,"BARBARA: Oh, don't be such a baby. Come here. "
268,"(she combs his hair forward, Roman-style) "
269,IAN: How long do you think the Doctor will be away? 
270,BARBARA: No idea. Why? 
271,"IAN: Well, the owner of this house could come back before he does. I"
272,"ouch. That hurts, you know! "
273,"BARBARA: Sorry. Well, if he does come back, we can always go back to"
274,the Tardis. There. How's that? 
275,IAN: Feels awful. 
276,"BARBARA: Well, why don't you go and look in the spring? "
277,(he checks his reflection in the fountain) 
278,"IAN: Hey. Hey, that's not too bad. "
279,"BARBARA: Well, it's all part of the service. I take in washing too. "
280,IAN: Not bad at all. (declaims Antony's speech from Act
281,"3, Scene 2 of Julius Caesar) Friends, Romans, countrymen!"
282,"Lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. "
283,"BARBARA: Oh boy, that was a mistake."
284,
285,[Roadside]
286,
287,(at night) 
288,"DIDIUS: I've finished feeding them, Sevcheria. "
289,SEVCHERIA: Good. They need all the fattening they can get. 
290,(they are talking about their slaves) 
291,SEVCHERIA: Not many in the consignment is there? 
292,DIDIUS: They're a poor looking bunch. 
293,"SEVCHERIA: Ah well, if we're to get the four from the villa, we'd"
294,"better get moving, Didius."
295,
296,[Tent]
297,
298,(They pick up their weapons) 
299,"SEVCHERIA: As soon as we get back, we'll break camp. We shall be away"
300,from here tonight. 
301,"DIDIUS: Before any local enquiries arise, is that the idea? "
302,"SEVCHERIA: We'll make a slave trader of you yet, Didius. Come on, lets"
303,get them.
304,
305,[Villa]
306,
307," BARBARA: You know Ian, I could get used to this"
308,sort of life. 
309,IAN: Mmm. I already have. What about another drink? 
310,"BARBARA: Oh, yes, I'd love one. Thank you. "
311,"IAN: No ice, I'm afraid. "
312,BARBARA: There's some in the fridge. 
313,IAN: Ah. 
314,(Ian starts to leave the room before the penny drops) 
315,"IAN: Very funny, very funny. "
316,BARBARA: You went! 
317,"IAN: Well, here's to the first fridge. "
318,BARBARA: Cheers. 
319,"IAN: O tempora, o mores. "
320,(there's a thud) 
321,"IAN: Did you hear something, Barbara? "
322,BARBARA: No. Like what? 
323,IAN: There's someone out there. 
324,"BARBARA: No, you must be imagining things. "
325,"IAN: No, no, I'm not. Who's there? What do you want? "
326,(Didius comes in with his sword drawn) 
327,IAN: Who are you? 
328,BARBARA: Ian!? 
329,SEVCHERIA: Where are the others? 
330,"BARBARA: They're not here, they've gone away. "
331,"IAN: We can explain, if you put up your swords. "
332,"SEVCHERIA: Did you hear that, Didius? They can explain. "
333,(Ian throws Didius in the fountain) 
334,IAN: Run Barbara! 
335,"(Sevcheria and Ian fight. Barbara picks up a vase, and hits Ian with it"
336,by mistake) 
337,"BARBARA: Oh, Ian! Ian! "
338,(Sevcheria puts Barbara over his shoulder) 
339,SEVCHERIA: Lets get them back to the camp. 
340,"BARBARA: Ian, wake up!"
341,
342, [Road] 
343," DOCTOR: Well, what have we here? "
344,VICKI: Just another dreary old statue. 
345,"DOCTOR: No, it might be somebody famous, my child. "
346,"DOCTOR: What's this? Wait there, dear. "
347,(The Doctor goes into the bushes and Vicki follows. They find the dead
348,lyre player) 
349,"VICKI: Oh, the poor man. "
350,"DOCTOR: Yes, he's dead, and it doesn't look a natural death to me. "
351,VICKI: It's a lonely stretch of road. Maybe he was set upon by robbers?
352,"They did happen in this time, didn't they? "
353,"DOCTOR: They did, my dear, yes, but that isn't the answer here. (picks"
354,up the lyre.) They've left his belongings too. 
355,VICKI: Maybe they didn't have time. 
356,"DOCTOR: Oh, they had plenty of time to drag him off the road. "
357,"VICKI: Doctor, I've seen him before. He was playing in the square when"
358,Barbara and I went to the market. 
359,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, there's nothing we can do for him now, my dear. No,"
360,nothing at all. 
361,(a figure approaches) 
362,DOCTOR: Stay here! 
363,VICKI: Be careful. 
364,DOCTOR: Good evening. Are you looking for somebody? Something? 
365,"CENTURION: Why, yes, I am. "
366,"DOCTOR: Tell me, do you always wave that sword about like that? "
367,CENTURION: What do you mean? 
368,"DOCTOR: Well, you can easily kill someone. Swords are dangerous, you"
369,know. 
370,(The Centurion sheaths his sword) 
371,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, thank you, that's better. Now tell me, whom or what,"
372,"er, you, er, were you looking for? "
373,CENTURION: Is that your lyre? 
374,"DOCTOR: Why? Why, have you lost one? "
375,"CENTURION: No, no, only if it is yours? "
376,"DOCTOR: And what if it is, hmm? "
377,"CENTURION: Why, it's you I'm looking for. "
378,"DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, I see. Yes. "
379,"CENTURION: You must be Maximus Pettulian from Corinth, whose skill as a"
380,musician is talked of even in Rome. 
381,DOCTOR: Really? Most interesting. 
382,CENTURION: We expected you in Assessium yesterday. When you failed to
383,"arrive, I sent my men out to search for you. I count it my good fortune"
384,that I've personally found you unharmed. 
385,"DOCTOR: If I am the man you're looking for, tell me why should I be"
386,"harmed, hmm? "
387,CENTURION: All roads to Rome are dangerous for travellers. When you
388,"sent word that you intended to make your way on foot, playing your lyre"
389,"for the people, it caused great concern at court. "
390,DOCTOR: At court? 
391,CENTURION: Caesar Nero's court. The Emperor of all Rome is very
392,concerned for your safe arrival. He looks forward to discussing your
393,music with you. 
394,"DOCTOR: The Emperor. Nero, eh? Ha, ha, yes, of course, I have heard"
395,"that he that he plucks a string or two. Yes, yes. Oh, the child, she"
396,travels with me. She keeps her eye on all the lyres. 
397,"CENTURION: Then if you're ready, we'll travel to Assessium and then my"
398,men will escort you the rest of the way. 
399,"DOCTOR: Very well, we'll just attend to our imprimatur. "
400,"VICKI: Doctor, I know this "
401,"DOCTOR: At court, I must be very important. "
402,"VICKI: Listen, I know he's mistaken you for that man, but we can't go"
403,with him. 
404,"DOCTOR: But why not, my child? I'm sure he knows more about this"
405,business than he admits. And we shall never get a better chance of
406,meeting Nero. 
407,"VICKI: But Doctor, you don't even know your own name. "
408,"DOCTOR: Oh, of course I do, my dear. It, it, it, it's "
409,CENTURION: Maximus Pettulian? If you're ready? 
410,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, quite, quite, my child. Yes."
411,
412,[Tent]
413,
414, BUYER: Quite a stroke of luck meeting your train
415,"here, it'll save me a trip into Rome. "
416,SEVCHERIA: Always assuming we can reach a satisfactory agreement. 
417,BUYER: I'll give you a fair price. We need the replacements urgently. 
418,"SEVCHERIA: Three, you say? "
419,BUYER: Yes. How much for the British woman? 
420,"DIDIUS: More than you can afford, friend. "
421,SEVCHERIA: The woman goes with us to Rome. You can follow and bid if
422,you like. 
423,"BUYER: No harm in asking, I say. All right, three men. Seven hundred. "
424,DIDIUS: Each? 
425,[Roadside]
426,
427,(Ian tests their shackles as the haggling goes on
428,in the background) 
429,IAN: No good. We'll have to try something else. 
430,BARBARA: Yes. 
431,"IAN: They say we're going to move tonight, Barbara. We'll escape then. "
432,BARBARA: Will we? 
433,"IAN: Barbara, I know it looks bad, but "
434,BARBARA: Bad? Have you any idea how the Roman's treated their slaves?
435,"Or how many of them escaped? Besides, time is against us. "
436,IAN: The Doctor. 
437,BARBARA: I haven't been able to think about anything else. When he and
438,Vicki get back from Rome and 
439,IAN: They'll wait for us. They must wait for us. 
440,"BARBARA: Oh, yes, they'll wait for us. But for how long? "
441,(Didius checks Ian's shackle and slaps him) 
442,[Tent]
443,

928,feelings of my fellow artists. When Maximus Pettulion plays for the
929,"court of Rome, he must have the centre of the stage. He will receive"
930,the same rapt and hushed attention that I do when I put on a recital.

1734,IAN: No. Said we were dreaming. 
1735,"BARBARA: Oh, it isn't fair, Ian, is it? "

1747,BARBARA: But no one would admit that they couldn't hear him. 
1748,VICKI: Exactly! He fooled everybody. 
1749,"IAN: He usually does, Vicki. You'll see. "
