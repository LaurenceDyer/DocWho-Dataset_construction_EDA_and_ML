20,One 
21, [Prison]
22,
23, (The Doctor and Jo drive up to the Constable's
24,"Gateway entrance to Dover Castle, currently masquerading as HM Prison"
25,"Stangmoor, and parks on the drawbridge.) "
26,JO: It looks like Dracula's castle. 
27,"DOCTOR: Well, you're right about the castle bit. It used to be a"
28,fortress in the Middle Ages. 
29,JO: Doctor? You'll need this. 
30,(Jo gives him an ID pass.) 
31,"DOCTOR: Thanks, Jo. "
32,(The Doctor rings the entrance bell.) 
33,"DOCTOR: Smile, Jo. "
34,JO: What? 
35,DOCTOR: You're on camera. 
36,"(The Doctor waves at the CCTV, and the personnel in the security room"
37,stare at the crazy man on the monitor. A prison officer comes out.) 
38,"DOCTOR: Oh, good morning. Er, observers from UNIT. My admission pass. "
39,"OFFICER: (into R/T) Right. Passes checked and satisfactory. Right, open"
40,the gates. 
41,(The Doctor gets back into Bessie.) 
42,DOCTOR: Abandon hope all ye who enter here. 
43,(They drive through the gates into a courtyard.)
44,
45, [Prison cell block]
46,
47," (The prisoners are restless, and making lots of"
48,noise in their cells which masks some dialogue. A central staircase
49,leads up to a catwalk. By a glass brick wall is a door labelled Process
50,Theatre.) 
51,POWERS: Green! Calm the men down. The Governor's on his way. 
52,(Green goes up the stairs.) 
53,"GOVERNOR: Morning, Chief. Everything all right? "
54,"POWERS: Will be, sir. "
55,"GOVERNOR: Good, good. Well, let's see to it. "
56,OFFICER : Keep that noise down! 
57,[Cell block landing]
58,
59,"(The Governor, Powers, Kettering and Summers, in a"
60,"white lab coat, go up the stairs and are let through a gate to another"
61,corridor leading to steps downwards.) KETTERING: Why do they always
62,have to make that stupid row? 
63,SUMMERS: It always happens when sentences are being carried out.
64,
65, [Prison cell]
66,
67," (Two guards are with the prisoner, who leaps up"
68,when the party enters.) 
69,GOVERNOR: George Patrick Barnham. 
70,"BARNHAM: No, you're not going to take me anywhere! "
71,GOVERNOR: You have been sentenced by a court of law. 
72,BARNHAM: Get away from me! 
73,GOVERNOR: The time has come for that sentence to be carried out. 
74,BARNHAM: Go on! Get out! All of you! 
75,SUMMERS: I'll give him something to calm him. 
76,"BARNHAM: You won't give me nothing, mate. Get out, all of you! "
77,"POWERS: Pack it in, Barnham. You're just being stupid. "
78,BARNHAM: You're not going to get me out there! 
79,POWERS: Get him! 
80,(The two guards grab Barnham.) 
81,GOVERNOR: All right. 
82,GUARD: You come easy. 
83,"BARNHAM: Take it easy, you'll break me arm. "
84,"(Protesting loudly, Barnham is manhandled up the short staircase.)"
85,
86, [Process Theatre]
87,
88, (It is not just Jo and the Doctor who are gathered
89,to observe something. There is a whole gaggle of men with clipboards
90,sitting around.) 
91,"GREEN: Sorry about the noise, ladies and gentlemen. Just a temporary"
92,disturbance. 
93,JO: Temporary disturbance? It sounds like a full-scale riot. 
94,DOCTOR: Morbid lot of sensation seekers. 
95,JO: Then why did you insist on coming here? 
96,"DOCTOR: Scientific curiosity, my dear. "
97,"JO: Oh, yes. "
98,(Everyone sits down.) 
99,DOCTOR: Something's been worrying me about this Keller process ever
100,"since I first heard of it. Ah, the curtain is about to go up. "
101,"(The Governor, Kettering and Powers enter.) "
102,POWERS: Keep them quiet. 
103,"GREEN: All right, chief. "
104,(Green leaves.) 
105,"GOVERNOR: Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. "
106,DOCTOR: Good morning. 
107,"GOVERNOR: May I introduce Professor Kettering, who will explain the"
108,process you're about to see demonstrated. 
109,"KETTERING: Well, as you're no doubt aware, we no longer execute our"
110,hardened criminals and killers. Modern society has progressed far
111,"beyond that primitive form of retribution. Today, science "
112,"DOCTOR: (sotto) It all depends what you mean by progress, doesn't it. "
113,KETTERING: Science has abolished the hangman's noose and substituted
114,this infallible method. Professor Emil Keller 
115,DOCTOR: (sotto) People who talk about infallibility are usually on very
116,"shaky ground, I think. "
117,KETTERING: For the benefit of the less sophisticated members of my
118,"audience, I will explain in very simple terms. Professor Emil Keller,"
119,"the inventor of this process, discovered that anti-social behaviour was"
120,"governed by certain negative or evil impulses. Now this machine, the"
121,"Keller machine, extracts these impulses and leaves a rational,"
122,well-balanced individual. 
123,DOCTOR: It doesn't. 
124,JO: What? 
125,KETTERING: May I be permitted to continue? 
126,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Yes, please do. "
127,KETTERING: Thank you. The condemned man is placed here (in a chair)
128,"after being tranquillised, with his head under this dome. A series of"
129,probes are attached to his skull so as to connect with the neural
130,circuits. The extraction process is controlled here. The negative
131,impulses are stored in that reservoir box there. 
132,DOCTOR: Where do they go after that? 
133,"KETTERING: Nowhere, sir. I repeat, they are stored in the box. "
134,DOCTOR: Which is now full of these negative or evil impulses. 
135,KETTERING: Not full. The indicator registers only sixty five percent at
136,this time. The machine has been used very successfully in Switzerland.
137,A hundred and twelve cases have been processed to date and today we
138,"shall witness the one hundred and thirteenth. Thank you, Doctor"
139,Summers. 
140,"(Barnham is wheeled in on a gurney, drugged and in an operating gown.) "
141,"SUMMERS: Come on, old chap. Up you get. "
142,(Barnham is helped into the chair and a metal cap fastened to his
143,head.) 
144,"KETTERING: When the process is completed, the negative impulses that"
145,made this man a criminal will have been removed. He will take his place
146,"as a useful, if lowly, member of society. Are you ready, Doctor"
147,Summers? 
148,SUMMERS: Yes. 
149,(Kettering adjusts the machine that holds the reservoir box then goes
150,to the main control panel and flicks switches. He nods to the
151,Governor.) 
152,GOVERNOR: Let the sentence of the Court been carried out. 
153,"(The lights go down, leaving Barnham in a spotlight. The machine starts"
154,pulsing. Barnham screams.) 
155,DOCTOR: I knew there was something evil about that machine. 
156,SUMMERS: Kettering! Look at the dial. 
157,KETTERING: What of it? 
158,SUMMERS: It's never registered so high before. 
159,(Summers checks Barnham for a heart beat.) 
160,"GOVERNOR: Mister Kettering, what's happening? "
161,(Kettering turns off the machine and the lights come back up.) 
162,GOVERNOR: Well? 
163,KETTERING: A minor malfunction. The machine compensated. The process is
164,completed satisfactorily. 
165,DOCTOR: (sotto) Satisfactorily be blowed. 
166,KETTERING: The subject will be taken away to recuperate and within an
167,hour or two he will be perfectly normal. 
168,"DOCTOR: I admire your confidence, sir. "
169,"KETTERING: Thank you. That is all, gentlemen. "
170,"(As the observers leave, the Doctor goes over to the Governor and"
171,Kettering.) 
172,"GOVERNOR: I take it everything was all right, Mister Kettering? "
173,"KETTERING: Yes, of course, Governor. "
174,"DOCTOR: Then would you kindly explain, sir, that unfortunate man's"
175,reaction? 
176,KETTERING: An excess of negative particles. The machine overreacted. 
177,"DOCTOR: In other words, you don't know. "
178,"KETTERING: May I ask who you are, sir? "
179,"GOVERNOR: The Doctor is Scientific Advisor to UNIT, Mister Kettering. "
180,KETTERING: UNIT? 
181,GOVERNOR: United Nations Intelligence Taskforce. 
182,"KETTERING: How interesting, though I fail to see what concern it is "
183,"DOCTOR: UNIT, sir, was set up to deal with new and unusual menaces to"
184,"mankind. And in my view, this machine of yours is just that. Jo."
185,
186, [Prison Medical ward]
187,
188, (Barnham is alive but unconscious.) 
189,SUMMERS: Right. 
190,(Kettering enters.) 
191,KETTERING: Well? 
192,"SUMMERS: Nothing much wrong physically. Respiration normal, pulse"
193,rate's a little high but that's usual after the process. 
194,"KETTERING: Ah, exactly. A completely successful treatment. "
195,SUMMERS: The reaction was unusually violent. 
196,"KETTERING: Really, my dear Summers, you're as bad as that interfering"
197,fool from UNIT. 
198,(A telephone rings.) 
199,SUMMERS: Excuse me. 
200,[Medical office]
201,
202, SUMMERS: Medical wing. Yes? What? Have you told
203,the Governor? I'll be right over.
204,
205, [Prison Medical ward]
206,
207, SUMMERS: (to orderly) Come with me. (to another)
208,You stay with the patient. 
209,KETTERING: Anything the matter? 
210,SUMMERS: There's been some kind of an accident in the process room.
211,They think the man's dead.
212,
213, [Process Theatre]
214,
215, (A young man is lying on the floor. Green checks
216,his wallet as Summers and the orderlies enter.) 
217,SUMMERS: What happened? 
218,"GREEN: I don't know, sir. "
219,GOVERNOR: What happened? 
220,"GREEN: I don't know, sir. I was coming along the corridor and I heard"
221,him screaming. 
222,DOCTOR: Is he dead? 
223,"SUMMERS: Yes, he's dead. "
224,KETTERING: Probably a heart attack. Delayed shock from seeing the
225,process. 
226,"DOCTOR: Perhaps, but I doubt it. Might I suggest an immediate"
227,investigation into his past medical history and a post mortem. 
228,"SUMMERS: Yes. Yes, a good idea. I'll see to it right away. Get a"
229,"stretcher, will you? "
230,(Summers leaves.) 
231,"JO: Doctor? Did you see his face? He looks terrified. And those marks,"
232,like 
233,"DOCTOR: Bites and scratches? Yes, I know. "
234,"JO: Look, I think we'd better get on to the Brigadier. "
235,"DOCTOR: Yes, I agree, Jo, but not just yet. Now, let me get that post"
236,mortem first. It'll give me more to go on. 
237,"JO: All right. Anyway, I don't think he'd thank us for disturbing him"
238,right now. 
239,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
240,"JO: He did tell you all about it, Doctor. "
241,DOCTOR: All about what? 
242,JO: Today's the first ever World Peace Conference. UNIT's handling all
243,the security arrangements.
244,
245, [Brigadier's office]
246,
247,(This time he has managed to requisition a very
248,"posh room with big double doors, fancy fireplace and large potted"
249,ficus.) 
250,"BRIGADIER: (on phone) Yes, that's all very well, sir, but in my"
251,opinion. 
252,(Yates enters.) 
253,"BRIGADIER: Yes, I see, sir. Of course, sir. I take it that is your"
254,"final decision? Very well, sir, goodbye. "
255,"YATES: Trouble, sir? "
256,BRIGADIER: That was the Ministry. UNIT'll be responsible for the safe
257,transport of the missile. It's been cleared with Geneva. 
258,"YATES: Well, that's all we needed. What with the peace conference on"
259,our hands as well. 
260,"BRIGADIER: Yes. I want you to take charge of this escort detail,"
261,Captain Yates. I've got quite enough on my plate as it is. 
262,YATES: I'll get onto it right away. 
263,"BRIGADIER: Oh, is the Doctor back from Stangmoor yet? "
264,"YATES: No sir. Er, what exactly is he doing down there? "
265,"BRIGADIER: Observing new development in the treatment of criminals, I"
266,"believe. Oh well, I suppose it'll keep him out of mischief. By the way,"
267,how are things at the conference? 
268,"YATES: Oh, all running smoothly, sir. "
269,BRIGADIER: I only hope it lasts. 
270,"(A Chinese woman officer bursts in, followed by a female UNIT officer -"
271,Bell.) 
272,"BRIGADIER: All right, Corporal Bell. Yes, Captain Chin Lee, what can I"
273,do for you? 
274,"CHIN LEE: Brigadier, an outrage has been committed against the Chinese"
275,"people's delegation. As you are in charge of security arrangements, we"
276,hold you directly responsible. 
277,"BRIGADIER: What is it now, Captain? "
278,CHIN LEE: Important state documents have been stolen from General Cheng
279,Teik's suite. 
280,YATES: That's impossible. There's a twenty four hour guard on all the
281,delegate's suites. 
282,"CHIN LEE: Nevertheless, the theft has occurred. Your guards are"
283,inefficient. Perhaps they take bribes? 
284,"BRIGADIER: That is an insulting suggestion, Captain. I will not"
285,"tolerate any! Very well, Captain, I'll investigate the matter"
286,immediately. 
287,CHIN LEE: I must warn you that this puts the success of the peace
288,conference in grave jeopardy. We suspect the imperialist Americans of
289,this crime. 
290,BRIGADIER: Naturally. I assure you that every effort will be made to
291,locate the missing papers and to punish whoever is responsible. 
292,CHIN LEE: Any further trouble and our delegation will withdraw from
293,this conference. 
294,(Chin Lee leaves.) 
295,BRIGADIER: More trouble. 
296,"YATES: Mmm, pity. She's quite a dolly. "
297,(Chin Lee leaves 24 Cornwall Gardens and walks straight past the
298,limousine waiting for her. She goes to the Green in middle of the area
299,and takes a document from her jacket. She removes it's ribbon and sets
300,fire to it then drops it into a waste paper basket at the last moment.
301,Then she flinches and touches a round metal device just behind her
302,right ear before leaving the scene.)
303,
304, [Process Theatre]
305,
306, DOCTOR: And you are still convinced this Keller
307,process is working normally? 
308,"KETTERING: Yes, of course it is. I mean, you've just seen Barnham. "
309,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I've seen him. "
310,"KETTERING: Look, Emil Keller himself installed it here. I worked"
311,closely with him. I know every facet of the process. 
312,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know. But I still don't like it. "
313,GOVERNOR: What? 
314,"DOCTOR: Interfering with the mind, Governor. It's a dangerous business."
315,
316,"KETTERING: Well, it's hardly your concern, is it? "
317,"DOCTOR: Professor Kettering, it is everyone's concern! "
318,SUMMERS : After you. 
319,(Jo and Summers enter.) 
320,"GOVERNOR: Ah, Doctor Summers. Any news for us? "
321,SUMMERS: I've got the post mortem report. 
322,KETTERING:: Well? 
323,"SUMMERS: The deceased's name was Arthur Linwood, a medical student in"
324,his final year. 
325,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, but what did he die of? "
326,SUMMERS: Heart failure. 
327,KETTERING: Watching the process was too much for him. 
328,"SUMMERS: But he didn't have a weak heart, Mister Kettering. "
329,DOCTOR: Anything in his medical history? 
330,"SUMMERS: Yes, I called his hospital. He suffered from a fear of certain"
331,animals. 
332,"DOCTOR: Oh, which ones? "
333,"SUMMERS: Well, apparently, in the laboratory he was absolutely"
334,terrified of 
335,DOCTOR: Rats? 
336,SUMMERS: Yes. 
337,"DOCTOR: Tell me, these marks on his face on his face and neck, these"
338,"bites and scratches, could they have been caused by rats? "
339,"SUMMERS: Certainly they could, yes. "
340,GOVERNOR: But there are no rats in this room. There's none in the
341,entire prison. 
342,SUMMERS: Yet all the indications are that he was attacked by a hoard of
343,"them, and the shock killed him. "
344,KETTERING: You must be mistaken. 
345,DOCTOR: But Linwood is dead. 
346,KETTERING: Because of heart failure! 
347,"DOCTOR: No, Professor Kettering, because of this machine. "
348,KETTERING: I tell you that man's death had nothing to do with this
349,"machine, and if you were a scientist you'd understand. "
350,"DOCTOR: If I were a scientist? Let me tell you, sir, that I am a"
351,"scientist, and I have been for several thousand. Jo. "
352,(The Doctor leaves.) 
353,KETTERING: The man's mad. 
354,"JO: On the contrary, sir, he happens to be a genius. I do wish you'd"
355,listen to him. 
356,(Jo leaves.) 
357,SUMMERS: Victor? 
358,"GOVERNOR: I think you'd better give this machine a thorough check,"
359,Professor Kettering. 
360,"KETTERING: Yes, of course, Governor. But I assure you there's no reason"
361,for anxiety. 
362,"GOVERNOR: All the same, better safe than sorry?"
363,
364, [UNIT office]
365,
366, (Yates and Bell are both on telephone when the
367,Brigadier enters.) 
368,YATES: I'll give you the final security schedules just as soon as I've
369,had a chance to clear them with the Brigadier. 
370,"BELL: A call for you on line one, sir. "
371,"BRIGADIER: Oh, put it through, will you? "
372,"YATES: Right, right, I'll ring you back within twenty minutes. "
373,(Another telephone rings.) 
374,"BELL: UNIT HQ? Oh, good morning, sir."
375,
376, [Brigadier's office]
377,
378," BELL : Yes, certainly Captain, I'm just "
379,"BRIGADIER: Lethbridge Stewart? I see. You're sure? Very well, continue"
380,"the search. (into intercom) Captain Yates, will you come in for a"
381,moment please? 
382,(Yates enters.) 
383,"BRIGADIER: Oh, sit down. Well, there's no trace of Chin Lee's missing"
384,papers. Our people have turned the place inside out. It wouldn't
385,surprise me if she lost them herself. 
386,"BELL: Excuse me, sir. Captain Chin Lee on the phone. Do you want to"
387,speak to her? 
388,"BRIGADIER: Yes, I'll speak to her. "
389,"BELL: Hotline, sir. "
390,"BRIGADIER: I wonder what she's complaining of this time? Yes, good"
391,"afternoon, Captain Chin Lee. What can I do for you? Yes, I see. No,"
392,don't touch anything. I'll be over at once. 
393,"YATES: More stolen papers, sir? "
394,BRIGADIER: (into intercom.) Get my car ready at once. 
395,"BELL : Right, sir. "
396,BRIGADIER: We've got real trouble this time. The Chinese delegate's
397,dead. 
398,"(In the Process Theatre, the reservoir dial flickers as Kettering takes"
399,a panel off the control console. Then he puts his hands to his head as
400,the machine starts to hum.)
401,
402, [Prison cell block]
403,
404," OFFICER: All right men, keep that noise down. "
405,"POWERS: Starting up again, are they? "
406,GREEN: Just like before. I don't what it is. 
407, [Process Theatre] 
408, (The machine is humming loudly as Kettering 'sees'
409,a vast expanse of open water. He moves his arms as if swimming.) 
410,"KETTERING: No, no. "
411,(Then he raises his arms above his head as he sinks to the floor. The
412,"machine shuts itself off. Later, he is lying on a stretcher. Summers"
413,puts the blanket over Kettering's face and orderlies carry him away.) 
414,"GOVERNOR: Dead. Do you know how it happened, Roland? "
415,"SUMMERS: I'm not sure. It's incredible, really. "
416,"DOCTOR: Oh, come on, man, come on. "
417,"SUMMERS: From the position of the body, tinge of the skin "
418,DOCTOR: Well? 
419,SUMMERS: All the symptoms are consistent with death by drowning. 
420,GOVERNOR: But that's ridiculous! 
421,DOCTOR: Like the rats? 
422,SUMMERS: Shall I go and check on his medical record? 
423,"DOCTOR: Yes, a good idea. How long would you say he'd been dead? "
424,"SUMMERS: Oh, a matter of minutes, five at the outside. "
425,(Summers leaves.) 
426,JO: That must have been about the time the riot started. 
427,"DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. "
428,GOVERNOR: Are you suggesting there's some connection? 
429,"DOCTOR: This machine has the power to affect men's minds, Governor, and"
430,it's growing stronger. 
431,"GOVERNOR: Oh, come now, Doctor. It's only a machine. "
432,"DOCTOR: Yes, maybe, but nevertheless it's dangerous and it should be"
433,destroyed now! 
434,"GOVERNOR: Well, I've no authority to do that. I'll report your"
435,recommendations to the Home Office but they'll have to decide. 
436,DOCTOR: I wonder how many deaths it'll take to convince them?
437,
438, [Chinese Delegation suite]
439,
440, (Another body is covered over. Photographs are
441,being taken of the mess caused by an apparent struggle.) 
442,"CHIN LEE: First theft, Brigadier, now murder. What are you going to do"
443,about it? 
444,BRIGADIER: Who else knows about this? 
445,CHIN LEE: No one. I called you at once. 
446,YATES: Shall I call the police. sir? 
447,"BRIGADIER: Yes, just a courtesy call, but tell them we'll handle this"
448,ourselves. And I want a full check on all movements in and out of this
449,suite before Cheng Teik's death. And no press. 'D' notice. 
450,"YATES: Right, sir. "
451,"BRIGADIER: And get the Doctor back from Stangmoor, will you? I want him"
452,here. 
453,"YATES: Yes, sir. "
454,(Yates leaves.) 
455,"BRIGADIER: Now then, Captain. I'd like you to tell me exactly what"
456,"happened, please? In detail. "
457,CHIN LEE: My appointment with the General was for twelve pm. There were
458,some details to discuss about the conference. 
459,BRIGADIER: And you were punctual? 
460,CHIN LEE: I am always punctual. I showed my pass to your UNIT sentry
461,and entered as the clock was striking twelve. 
462,BRIGADIER: Go on. 
463,CHIN LEE: There is nothing more to tell. I saw the General's body and
464,phoned you. 
465,BRIGADIER: Immediately? 
466,CHIN LEE: Of course. 
467,"BRIGADIER: Excuse me a moment, will you? Oh, Corporal Bell? I'd like"
468,you to.

564,JO: But why should you? 
565,"DOCTOR: Well, some time ago, Jo, I witnessed a terrible catastrophe. A"
566,"whole world just, just disappeared in flames. Well, this machine picked"
567,that memory out of my mind and used it to attack me. 
568,"JO: This fire you saw, it wasn't real. "
569,"DOCTOR: Neither was the water, nor the rats, yet Linwood is dead and so"

571,"JO: If this machine's so dangerous, why not just blow it up? Destroy"

934,over. 
935,(Mailer and Vosper move aside.) 
936,"VOSPER: We can't stay here, Harry. They'll starve us out. "
937,MAILER: What we want is hostages. 
938,VOSPER: We've got 'em! 
939,"MAILER: We need more. Now, if we cut around the kitchen, get to the"
940,"prison hospital, maybe we can grab a doctor. All right? Now you lot"

960,"BRIGADIER: All right, keep looking. Yes, let me know as soon as you"
961,hear anything. 
962,"DOCTOR: Yes, all right, yes. I'll hang on. There's some trouble there"
963,with the lines. 
964,"BRIGADIER: Lethbridge Stewart? What? No, don't arrest her. I'll deal"
965,with this myself. Message from one of my agents. Chin Lee's turned up
966,again.

1023,ALCOTT: What are you doing? 
1024,(Alcott clutches at his head as the Keller machine starts up.) 
1025,ALCOTT: What's this noise? This noise in my head. This terrible sound!
1026,This sound. What's happening? 
1027,"(As far as Alcott is concerned, Chin Lee has just become a fearsome"

1038,"it turns back into Chin Lee, who gently collapses.) "
1039,FU PENG: That was one of the legendary monsters of my people. 
1040,"DOCTOR: A collective hallucination, gentlemen, nothing more. Who's"
1041,that? 
1042,BRIGADIER: Senator Alcott. Is he dead? 
1043,"DOCTOR: No, but he's suffering from acute shock. "
1044,FU PENG: Sing-sen! 
1045,DOCTOR: Yes? 
1046,FU PENG: What is this? 
1047,(Fu Peng removes the metal disc from behind Chin Lee's ear.) 
1048,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a telepathic amplifier. "
1049,BRIGADIER: Is that what caused the hallucinations? 
1050,"DOCTOR: No, not caused them. No, it merely picks up the impulses and"
1051,projects them through Chin Lee's mind. 
1052,BRIGADIER: Impulses? From where? 
1053,"DOCTOR: Well, unless I'm very much mistaken, from the Keller machine at"

1078,"DOCTOR: Wa ai, Peng-san. Wa ai. Chin Lee was being used by someone who"
1079,was trying to drive this world into war.

1167,"YATES : I don't quite follow, sir. "
1168,"BRIGADIER : Quite frankly, Yates, neither do I. It's something to"

1180,prison with him. 
1181,BRIGADIER: And you agreed to go? 
1182,CHIN LEE: Prison reform is high on our list of priorities in Peking! 
1183,BRIGADIER: Ah. And can you tell us what happened at Stangmoor? 
1184,CHIN LEE: I know that we went to the process room. I cannot remember. 
1185,"BRIGADIER: Well, did you see him again? "
1186,"CHIN LEE: Yes, many times, but whenever I think about it, my mind"

1189,BRIGADIER: Whose usual technique?

1211,his with him? They'd kill anyone who came in their way. How many
1212,innocent lives do you think I'd be risking then? 
1213,"POWERS: I've done everything I can, Doctor. B wing's sealed off. If"

1373,(The Master and Mailer put on the gas masks. They throw the small
1374,"grenades, knocking out both officers. The Governor is at the top of the"
1375,short staircase and turns to set off the alarm. Mailer shoots him in

1442,(The criminals leave.) 
1443,MASTER: You don't seem at all surprised. 
1444,DOCTOR: Hardly. How's the riot going? 
1445,"MASTER: Oh, long since over. I control the prison now. "
1446,"DOCTOR: Do you? And, er, where is Miss Grant to be found? "
1447,MASTER: Reclining in one of our best cells. 
1448,"DOCTOR: Is she indeed. Well, let me tell you this, that if you harm so"
1449,"much as one hair of her head, I'll "
1450,"MASTER: You'll do nothing, or I'll put a bullet through both your"
1451,hearts. 
1452,DOCTOR: Why the delay? I take it that I'm to be killed eventually? 
1453,"MASTER: Oh, eventually, yes. But unfortunately, I find I need your"
1454,help. 
1455,DOCTOR: You want me to help you with that machine of yours. Professor
1456,"Keller. You want to be careful of that thing, you know. One day it's"
1457,going to end up killing you. 
1458,"MASTER: Oh, it won't harm me. I created it. "
1459,DOCTOR: Huh! 
1460,MASTER: But recently I must admit that it has developed a mind of its
1461,own. Hence my need for your assistance while I'm engaged on other
1462,business. 
1463,DOCTOR: Oh? What other business? 
1464,MASTER: Your UNIT friends are transporting their nuclear missile. I
1465,intend to take it away from them.

1484,"and wipe out the peace conference, the world is at war. "
1485,DOCTOR: I see. 
1486,"(The Doctor goes to put his glass on the table, and knocks over the jug"
1487,of water. Then he overturns the whole desk. The Master tries to get his
1488,gun from the floor but slips on the spilt liquid while the Doctor takes
1489,cover behind a suit of armour. The Master fires but it is only a
1490,reflection. The Doctor makes it across the courtyard to Bessie and
1491,further as a prisoner tries to shoot at him from the ramparts. The
1492,Master leaves.)

1512, MASTER: I thought you'd make for here. 
1513,(Mailer enters.) 
1514,"MASTER: Hold it, Mailer! Let me have that gun. I think you'd better"
1515,"show our patient into the chair, Mailer, and handcuff him into it. "
1516,(The Doctor has no choice but to sit in the treatment chair as Mailer
1517,handcuffs his hands behind his back.) 
1518,DOCTOR: May I ask the purpose of this charade? 
1519,"MASTER: Certainly. You'd better wait outside, Mailer. "
1520,(The Master gives Mailer the gun. Mailer leaves.) 
1521,"MASTER: As you see, I have affected the necessary repairs. But before I"
1522,"let you control this machine for me, which I fully intend that you"
1523,"shall, it'll be very interesting to see exactly how long you can hold"
1524,"out against it. Now somewhere, you have, er. Ah-ha. "
1525,(The Master finds the telepathy device in the Doctor's pocket.) 
1526,"MASTER: Now this little device, as you know, transmits and amplifies"
1527,the power of the machine. What you may not know is that it can be
1528,"adjusted to turn that power against the wearer, like this. "
1529,(The Master puts the device behind the Doctor's left ear and switches
1530,on the machine.) 
1531,"DOCTOR: You know, this is all very tiresome. "
1532,"MASTER: Is it? Oh, I really would like to stop and watch your"
1533,nightmares. 
1534,DOCTOR: Then why don't you? 
1535,MASTER: I have other business as you know. Will you excuse me? 
1536,(The Master leaves the room in semi-darkness and bars the doors on the
1537,outside. The machine cranks itself up to full power and puts images in
1538,"the Doctor's mind. First the flames as before, then a familiar voice.) "

1546, (All the prisoners are suffering at the 'hands' of
1547,the Keller machine. Even the Master has to fight against its influence
1548,as he struggles over to Processing theatre and unbar the door. The
1549,Doctor is slumped in the chair as the Master manages to get to the
1550,control panel and eventually turn it off. Then the Master goes to the
1551,"Doctor and removes the amplifying device from behind his ear, then"
1552,grabs a handy stethoscope to check for signs of life. There is just one
1553,heartbeat. Mailer crawls in.)

1574,we could do some good there!

1581,it surprise you to know that one of your hearts stopped completely? You
1582,were within an inch of dying. 
1583,DOCTOR: You wanted. You wanted to know how long I could hold out
1584,"against that machine. Well, the answer is I can't. Nobody can. "
1585,"MASTER: Of course you can! If I can control it from that console, then"
1586,so can you. And you must while I'm not here. 
1587,"DOCTOR: No, no. "
1588,"MASTER: Oh, come on, Doctor. We are both Time Lords. "
1589,"DOCTOR: Be that as it may, I know the secret of that machine. Inside is"
1590,"a creature that feeds on the evil of the mind, and very soon it'll feed"
1591,on yours. 
1592,MASTER: Nonsense! Mailer! 
1593,(Mailer enters.) 
1594,MASTER: Release him. And then put him in the cell with Miss Grant. Now

1733,armed convicts roaming round the countryside? 
1734,"MAILER: If we can get our civvies back, there's cars outside. "

1740,captured or killed. 
1741,"MAILER: Yeah, all right. So, you've got a better idea? "
1742,"MASTER: I think so, yes. How would you like a free pardon, unlimited"
1743,money and a ticket to anywhere in the world? 
1744,MAILER: How would I like it? Do me a favour. 
1745,"MASTER: Right, pay attention. I'll show you how to get it. Now, that is"
1746,"Thunderbolt. It's a gas missile, nuclear powered and British, of"
1747,course. 
1748,MAILER: Of course. 
1749,"MASTER: The most important thing is that it's illegal, because gas"
1750,warfare's been outlawed for many years. Therefore the British
1751,"government are going to dump that in the sea. Now, tomorrow morning,"
1752,"that missile, with a very small escort, will pass within a few miles of"

1822,"DOCTOR: No, not while they're all chasing around. Let them cool off for"
1823,a bit. We'll try again later. 
1824,JO: Telephone. There must be a telephone here somewhere. 
1825,"DOCTOR: There is, but it's locked. "
1826,(The telephone is in a wooden box.) 
1827,"DOCTOR: In any case, it'll be manned by convicts. "
1828,(Jo turns on the slide projector.) 
1829,JO: What's that? 
1830,"DOCTOR: That, my dear Jo, is the Thunderbolt. Captain Yates is"
1831,escorting it. I hope.

1877,chopper standing by to take me down there as soon as possible. 
1878,"BELL: I'll get on to it right away, sir. "
1879,BRIGADIER: And I'll need a mobile HQ and a full forensic team in the
1880,area. 
1881,BELL: Extension three four. Shall I ask for police and army

1883,"BRIGADIER: No, UNIT personnel only. This missile isn't supposed to"

1907,BRIGADIER: Did you see what happened to Captain Yates? 
1908,BENTON: I thought they'd got him. 
1909,BRIGADIER: Not unless they took the body with them. One of the bikes is
1910,missing.

1929,JO: Do you really believe there's something alive in there? 
1930,DOCTOR: I do. 
1931,"JO: Well, what is it? "

2139,BRIGADIER: It all adds up. Benton saw a Black Maria when the missile
2140,was ambushed and I saw the Doctor and Miss Grant. I'm convinced the
2141,Master has taken over the prison to be used as a hideout for that
2142,missile.

2160,"COSWORTH: Yes, sir. "
2161,"BRIGADIER: Yes, you're right. It hasn't been blocked off either. It"

2220,will shoot you here and now. 
2221,"DOCTOR: Well, it's only a theory, but I think there may be one way to"
2222,inhibit that machine's power of movement. 
2223,MASTER: And now is your chance to put that theory to the test.

2269,BRIGADIER: Yes? 
2270,"BENTON: Well, I wondered if you'd had any news about Captain Yates,"
2271,sir. 
2272,"BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, Benton, there's nothing. Nothing at all. "
2273,"(Yates manages to break the ropes holding him, but then pretends to be"
2274,out cold again when a prisoner comes to check on him. The prisoner
2275,"leans over and Yates grabs his head, throwing him to the floor. Then he"
2276,takes the pistol and leaves.)
2277,
2278, [Prison workshop] 
2279, (As the machine sits in the process theatre across
2280,"the hallway, its reservoir full of black thoughts, the Doctor is fixing"
2281,up a large coil of cable.) 
2282,"MASTER: Look, Doctor, you must hurry! If that thing in there starts"
2283,moving again 
2284,"DOCTOR: I'm well aware of the urgency of the situation, thank you."
2285,"Right. Excuse me, will you? "
2286,MASTER: Oh. 
2287,"DOCTOR: Would you mind bringing that plug with you, please? "
2288,"MASTER: Oh, right. "
2289,DOCTOR: And the coil. 
2290,MASTER: Yeah. 
2291,DOCTOR: Thank you.
2292,
2293, [Prison cell block]
2294,
2295, (They go to a trolley with a large battery-like
2296,box on it. There is a slider and several switches on it.) 
2297,"MASTER: Look, tell me, what precisely do you intend to do? "
2298,DOCTOR: I'm going to try throwing this coil over that machine in there.
2299,"If I can get close enough to it without being killed, that is. "
2300,"MASTER: I see. Well, what can I do to help. "
2301,"DOCTOR: Well, I want you to operate these controls here and switch on"
2302,to full power when I call out. 
2303,MASTER: This is very ingenious. 
2304,"DOCTOR: If all goes well, it should set up an electric current in the"
2305,coil alternating on much the same frequency as the beta rhythms of the
2306,human brain. 
2307,MASTER: And you think that'll deal with it? 
2308,"DOCTOR: I don't know, but I think it'll confuse the creature enough to"
2309,take away its power of movement anyway. 
2310,"MASTER: Well, I hope you are right. "
2311,DOCTOR: So do I. 
2312,"(The Master plugs the cable into the box, while the Doctor puts on"
2313,protective clothing.) 
2314,"DOCTOR: Now switch it on now, will you? Bottom one. "
2315,"MASTER: Right. Well, good luck to you, Doctor. "
2316,"DOCTOR: Thank you. Right, you know what to do. "
2317,MASTER: Yes.
2318,
2319, [Process Theatre]
2320,
2321, (The Doctor kicks open the doors and sidles in
2322,"carefully. As he gets close, the machine starts up and the coil that"
2323,the Doctor is holding begins to spit sparks. The nightmare images
2324,return as the Doctor struggles to get the coil close to the machine.) 
2325,DALEK : Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy! Exterminate! Annihilate!
2326,Destroy! Exterminate! 
2327,(He slams it down over the body of the machine.) 
2328,DOCTOR: Now! 
2329,DALEK: Annihilate! 
2330,DOCTOR: Now! 
2331,"(Outside, the Master pushes the slider across the front of the box."
2332,Finally the machine switches off and the Doctor removes his protective
2333,helmet and gloves.)

2338,Congratulations. 
2339,"DOCTOR: It won't hold it for long, you know. That thing's intelligent."
2340,Soon it'll work out what happened and find a way to deal with it. 
2341,"MASTER: Then you'll have to think up something better, won't you. Now"
2342,"take the Doctor back to his cell, Mailer. "

2350,"DOCTOR: Yes, temporarily. "
2351,JO: You look tired. 
2352,DOCTOR: I am. Physically and mentally. 
2353,"JO: Hey, how about some food? Do you think they'd let us have any? "
2354,DOCTOR: I doubt it. Not after what happened last time. 
2355,JO: I've had nothing to eat all day. I'm starving. 
2356,"DOCTOR: Well, we shouldn't have thrown our breakfast at them, should"
2357,we? 
2358,"JO: Breakfast! Hey, wait a minute. I knew they wouldn't bother to clear"
2359,up. Here you are. 
2360,"DOCTOR: Oh, no thanks, Jo, you have it. I'll do without food for a"
2361,while. 
2362,"JO: No, we'll share it. And there's some water in the jug over here. "
2363,"DOCTOR: Oh, all right. Cheers. "
2364,JO: Cheers. 
2365,DOCTOR: Huh. Did I ever tell you about the time I was in the Tower of
2366,London? 
2367,JO: No? 
2368,DOCTOR: No? 
2369,JO: No. 
2370,"DOCTOR: Well, I shared a cell with a very strange chap called Raleigh. "
2371,JO: Raleigh? 
2372,"DOCTOR: Yeah, Sir Walter Raleigh. "
2373,JO: Oh. 
2374,DOCTOR: He got into some trouble with Queen Elizabeth. Elizabeth the
2375,"first, that is. He kept going on about this new vegetable of his he'd"
2376,"discovered, you see, called the potato. One day, he sat down, pointed a"

2393,"there, and booze for the Governor. Am I supposed to go back and tell"
2394,them you don't want it? They'll think you're barmy. 
2395,PRISONER: Hang about. (into R/T) Main gate here. I've got a big
2396,provisions lorry. Do I let it in? 
2397,"MAILER : Yeah, okay. But I want him out of here fast. "
2398,PRISONER: Drive up the main courtyard. Unload there. We'll give you a

2400,"BRIGADIER: Don't worry. Less time I spend in there, the better. "
2401,"PRISONER: Okay, open up. "
2402,"(The Brigadier goes back to the van and drives it through the gateway,"
2403,with the three soldiers following close behind. They take out the gate

2418,fired. The Brigadier gets a megaphone.) 
2419,BRIGADIER: This is Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart of UNIT. This prison is
2420,now in military hands.

2449,exactly as I say. 
2450,DOCTOR: Well? 
2451,MAILER: You're going to help me get out of here. You're going to walk
2452,out of here and tell those friends of yours that either I get out or
2453,I'm going to chop you down. All right? 
2454,JO: They won't listen. 
2455,"MAILER: Too bad for you if they don't. Come on, move!"

2478,"BRIGADIER: I'm glad to see you too, Doctor. All right, Miss Grant? "
2479,"JO: Yes, thanks. "
2480,DOCTOR: I see you've changed your job. 
2481,"BRIGADIER: Yes. Rather an effective disguise, don't you think? "
2482,"BENTON: Right, down there. "
2483,"BRIGADIER: Well, did you get the Master? "
2484,"BENTON: Sorry, sir. He seems to have got away. "

2497,"and nods, and the missile is aimed upwards. Back at Stangmoor, the"
2498,"Brigadier is setting up a mobile HQ in the Governor's office, complete"
2499,with maps on walls and radio.) 
2500,"DOCTOR: Look, the Master has got to be found, Brigadier. "
2501,BRIGADIER: I'm rather more concerned with finding that missile.

2523,(Jo and Benton leave.) 
2524,BRIGADIER: Who is this man? 
2525,DOCTOR: His name is Barnham. He's the last man to undergo the Keller
2526,process and you can see what it's done to him. He's got the mind of a
2527,child. Don't worry about him. You leave him to Jo. He trusts her.

2529,YATES : Trap One to Greyhound. Trap One to Greyhound.

2562,"BRIGADIER: I said, that about wraps it up. "
2563,DOCTOR: Does it? 
2564,BRIGADIER: Major Cosworth's throwing a cordon around that hangar now.
2565,I'll join him at mobile HQ and then we'll move in and mop things up. 
2566,"DOCTOR: You may not find the Master all that easy to mop up, Brigadier."
2567,
2568,BRIGADIER: I don't anticipate much trouble. 
2569,"DOCTOR: Well, don't forget he's got that rocket full of nerve gas. He"
2570,can point it at any city in Europe. 
2571,"BRIGADIER: Don't worry, Doctor. He won't get the chance. You coming"
2572,with me? 
2573,"DOCTOR: No, not for the moment. I've got to work out a way of"
2574,destroying that machine of his. If I can step up the voltage in that
2575,coil 
2576,"BRIGADIER: Yes, well, er, I'll leave the machine to you, and you can"
2577,leave Master to me.

2640,killed.

2659,"Stay there. Sit yourself down, that's it. "
2660,JO: But I don't understand. 
2661,"DOCTOR: The mind of evil, Jo. I should have realised. That creature"
2662,feeds on the evil impulses of the brain. 
2663,JO: And Barnham hasn't got any. 
2664,"DOCTOR: No, the machine extracted them all. Something in his mind acts"
2665,"as a screen and neutralises it. So long as he's here, we're perfectly"

2677,"COSWORTH: Fine, sir. I've just been on to the Ministry of Defence. "

2679,COSWORTH: Thunderbolt is equipped with an abort mechanism. Once in go
2680,"condition, it can be blown up at any time. "

2682,blow it up on the ground from here.

2707,"DOCTOR: Yes, please do. It's all extremely urgent. "
2708,BENTON: It's going to take quite a bit of organising. 
2709,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm quite sure it is, but neverthe "
2710,(The phone rings.) 
2711,BENTON: Acting Governor Benton here.
2712,
2713, [Hangar office]
2714,
2715, MASTER: Who? 
2716,BENTON : Stangmoor Prison - Acting Governor Sergeant Benton here. 
2717,"MASTER: I see. Er, would the Doctor be there by any chance? "
2718,"BENTON : I'll see, sir. Who's calling, please? "
2719,"MASTER: Er, just say it's an old friend."
2720,
2721, [Prison Governor's office]
2722,
2723," BENTON: It's for you, Doctor. Say's he's an old"
2724,friend of yours. 
2725,DOCTOR: Hello? Yes?
2726,
2727, [Hangar office]
2728,
2729," MASTER: Oh, Doctor, do I gather that the tables"
2730,have turned somewhat at Stangmoor?
2731,
2732, [Prison Governor's office]
2733,
2734, DOCTOR: You have gathered correctly.
2735,
2736, [Process Theatre]
2737,
2738, SUMMERS : Barnham? 
2739,(Summers enters.) 
2740,"SUMMERS: Jo, what on earth do you think you're doing? I told Barnham to"
2741,stay in the medical wing. 
2742,JO: He can't leave. We've got to stay here with that thing. 
2743,SUMMERS: But you'll get yourselves killed. 
2744,"JO: Doctor Summers, we have got to "
2745,"SUMMERS: Look, Jo! Jo, you know he's not well and that thing's"
2746,"dangerous. I've got to get him back to the medical wing. Now, come on! "
2747,(Summers drags Barnham towards the door and the machine starts up.) 
2748,"JO: No! No, you can't! "
2749,SUMMERS: Argh! My head! 
2750,(Jo leads Barnham back to the machine.) 
2751,"JO: Try, Barnham. "
2752,(When Barnham sits down again the machine stops.) 
2753,"SUMMERS: That thing, it's alive! "
2754,"JO: Yes, and if Barnham leaves here, that thing will kill all of us."
2755,
2756, [Prison Governor's office]
2757,
2758," DOCTOR: In spite of what I've said, do you still"
2759,intend to fire that rocket on London?
2760,
2761, [Hangar office]
2762,
2763, MASTER: I most certainly do! 
2764,"DOCTOR : Well, that would start a world war. "
2765,"MASTER: Exactly! And then later when this planet is in ruins, I shall"
2766,take over.
2767,
2768, [Prison Governor's office]
2769,
2770, DOCTOR: I see. Aren't you forgetting something? 
2771,"MASTER : Am I, Doctor? What? "
2772,DOCTOR: The dematerialisation circuit from your own Tardis.
2773,
2774, [Hangar office]
2775,
2776," DOCTOR: You can't leave Earth without that, can"
2777,you. 
2778,MASTER: Are you offering me a deal?
2779,
2780, [Prison Governor's office]
2781,
2782, DOCTOR: I am. Hand me back that rocket and I'll
2783,return your circuit. 
2784,MASTER : That's very generous of you. 
2785,DOCTOR: Leave Earth. Stop bothering us. Go somewhere else and be a
2786,"nuisance elsewhere. Well, what do you say? "
2787,(The Master thinks it over.) 
2788,DOCTOR: Well? 
2789,MASTER : Right!
2790,
2791, [Hangar office]
2792,
2793, MASTER: But you will bring that circuit to me here
2794,"at the hanger. You and you alone. At the first sign of treachery, the"
2795,first sign of interference from your UNIT friends and I launch the
2796,missile immediately.
2797,
2798, [Prison Governor's office]
2799,
2800," DOCTOR: Sergeant, can you contact the Brigadier"
2801,for me? 
2802,"BENTON: Well, I think so, Doctor. He should be back at mobile HQ by"
2803,now. 
2804,DOCTOR: Get onto him at once. Tell him he's got to cancel that attack.
2805,
2806, [Process Theatre]
2807,
2808, SUMMERS: You're quite sure there's nothing I can
2809,do? 
2810,"JO: No, honestly. "
2811,"SUMMERS: All right. Well, I've got a mass of wounded to attend to. I'll"
2812,"be in the medical wing if you need me. Look after him, Jo. And"
2813,yourself. 
2814,JO: Thank you. 
2815,"SUMMERS: Now, you do exactly what Miss Grant tells you, all right? Good"
2816,lad.
2817,
2818, [Prison Governor's office]
2819,
2820, (The Doctor is using the R/T.) 
2821,DOCTOR: But understand that you mustn't go anywhere near him. If he
2822,"catches sight of a uniform, he'll fire that rocket."
2823,
2824, [UNIT mobile HQ]
2825,
2826," BRIGADIER: Don't you worry, Doctor. Leave"
2827,everything to us. I've cancelled the attack and we'll send a dispatch
2828,"rider to HQ to get your circuit, just in case."
2829,
2830, [Prison Governor's office]
2831,
2832," DOCTOR: What do you mean, just in case? It's our"
2833,only chance. 
2834,"BRIGADIER : Oh, I don't know, Doctor. There are other ways of"
2835,dealing with him. 
2836,"DOCTOR: Now look, don't do anything stupid, Brigadier. He means what he"
2837,"says, you know."
2838,
2839, [UNIT mobile HQ]
2840,
2841," BRIGADIER: Don't you worry, Doctor. Over and out."
2842,
2843, [Prison Governor's office]
2844,
2845, DOCTOR: Lethbridge Stewart! 
2846,"BENTON: The Brigadier knows what he's doing, Doctor. "
2847,DOCTOR: I sincerely hope so. I'm going back to Miss Grant.
2848,
2849, [UNIT mobile HQ]
2850,
2851," BRIGADIER: Right, Major Cosworth. I want you to"
2852,get on to the missile control people. They're to maintain radio link
2853,with us and explode the missile when I give the word. 
2854,"COSWORTH: Right away, sir. "
2855,"BRIGADIER: Captain Yates, you'll be in charge of the evacuation. I want"
2856,the area around that hangar completely clear within a ten mile radius. 
2857,"YATES: Right, sir. "
2858,COSWORTH: Trap One to missile control. Report my signal. Over.
2859,
2860, [Process Theatre]
2861,
2862, JO: But I don't see why you're so upset. If you
2863,give him back the circuit and he hands over the missile 
2864,"DOCTOR: You just don't understand, do you, Jo? Once he gets that"
2865,circuit back he's free to roam through time and space. We'd never catch
2866,him. 
2867,JO: Then you'll just have to give in. The Master's got the missile and
2868,all we've got is this wretched machine. 
2869,"DOCTOR: Jo, will you stop stating the obvious. What did you say? "
2870,JO: I said all we've got is this machine. 
2871,"DOCTOR: Well, that's it. That's the answer. We've got the machine and"
2872,"we've got our friend, Barnham. "
2873,JO: I don't understand. 
2874,"DOCTOR: With a little help from you, old chap, we can destroy this"
2875,machine and the Master at the same time.
2876,
2877, [Hangar office]
2878,
2879, (The Master takes a unit out of the control panel
2880,then flicks the switches labelled Abort which are hidden under a
2881,cover.) 
2882,MASTER: Just in case somebody tries to be clever.
2883,
2884, [Process Theatre]
2885,
2886, (The brain has got its cover back on. Barnham goes
2887,"to pick it up, then recoils.) "
2888,JO: Don't worry. It can't hurt you. 
2889,"DOCTOR: Come on, old chap, come on. "
2890,JO: It's all right. 
2891,"DOCTOR: That's it. All right? Now don't forget. Whatever you do, don't"
2892,drop it. Now hang on to it tight. Pick it up. 
2893,(Barnham picks up the machine.) 
2894,"DOCTOR: Come on. That's it. Now, mind how you go. Mind how you go. All"
2895,"right? Not too heavy for you? Good, that's it. Now close the doors"
2896,"after us, will you, Sergeant? "
2897,"BENTON: Right, sir. "
2898,DOCTOR: Now mind his feet.
2899,
2900, [Brigadier's mobile office]
2901,
2902, BRIGADIER: We tried to explode Thunderbolt on the
2903,"ground, Doctor, but nothing happened. "
2904,DOCTOR: What did you expect? The Master may be a scoundrel but he is a
2905,scientist. He'll have disconnected the abort mechanism. 
2906,"BRIGADIER: There's only one thing for it, Doctor. We'll have to give"
2907,him back that wretched circuit. 
2908,"DOCTOR: Oh, has it arrived? "
2909,"COSWORTH: Just arrived, sir. "
2910,(The Doctor takes the caltrop shaped gizmo from the envelope.) 
2911,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's it. "
2912,"BRIGADIER: Believe me, Doctor, I hate to see the Master escape"
2913,unpunished as much as you do. 
2914,DOCTOR: It's where he'll escape to that worries me. What right have we
2915,got to let his loose on some other planet? 
2916,"BRIGADIER: Unless you've got some better plan, I can see no"
2917,alternative. 
2918,"DOCTOR: My dear Brigadier, of course I have a better plan."
2919,
2920, [Hangar]
2921,
2922," (A Black Maria arrives, with Jo, Barnham and the"
2923,machine in the back. The Master greets the Doctor carrying a gun.) 
2924,"MASTER: Very strange form of transport, Doctor. I hope you're not going"
2925,to try anything silly. 
2926,"DOCTOR: No, of course not. No, it's just that Bessie had broken down. "
2927,MASTER: Bessie? 
2928,"DOCTOR: You know, Bessie? "
2929,(The Doctor mimes steering.) 
2930,"MASTER: Oh, yes! "
2931,(The back of the van opens.) 
2932,MASTER: I think I should warn you that my (mime) is aimed and ready to
2933,fire. I just have to press the requisite button. 
2934,DOCTOR: That's very clever. 
2935,"(The Doctor walks over to the missile, turning the Master's back to the"
2936,van.) 
2937,"DOCTOR: My word, you have done well. "
2938,MASTER: Shall we get on with it? Did you bring the circuit with you? 
2939,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Here. "
2940,"MASTER: May I examine it, please? "
2941,DOCTOR: How do I know that you won't take the circuit and fire the
2942,missile anyway? 
2943,MASTER: I'm afraid you don't. You'll just have to trust me this once. 
2944,"DOCTOR: No, I don't think so. "
2945,(The machine on the ground by the van.) 
2946,"JO: Now, Doctor! "
2947,DOCTOR: Hai! 
2948,"(The Doctor kicks the gun out of the Master's hand, then he, Jo and"
2949,Barnham run into the hangar doorway as the Master flails on the ground
2950,next to the throbbing machine.) 
2951,"JO: (into R/T) Hello, Brigadier? Jo Grant here. Over. "
2952,"BRIGADIER : Hello, Miss Grant. We read you. Over."
2953,
2954, [Hangar office]
2955,
2956, JO : Doctor working on missile circuit. Stand
2957,by for abort instructions. Over. 
2958,"BRIGADIER : Well done, Miss Grant. Greyhound to Windmill three four"
2959,"two. Come in to land. I say again, come in to land. "
2960,PILOT : Wilco. 
2961,"(The Doctor finds where the component has been taken out of the panel,"
2962,and searches for it. The Brigadier and Cosworth wait for news. The
2963,Doctor finds the unit and plugs it back in as the helicopter comes in
2964,to land. The Doctor resets the controls and runs out.)
2965,
2966, [Hangar]
2967,
2968," DOCTOR: Right, Jo! "
2969,JO: We're on our way. Over and out. 
2970,DOCTOR: Come on! 
2971,(They run to the helicopter past the Master still writhing on the
2972,ground by the machine. Barnham stops and disrupts the effects so that
2973,the Master can get up and into the driving seat of the van. He runs
2974,over Barnham and makes his escape. The Doctor and Jo run back to their
2975,fallen friend.) 
2976,"DOCTOR: He's dead. Come on, Jo. Jo, come on. "
2977,(Jo and the Doctor get in the helicopter and it takes off.)
2978,
2979, [UNIT mobile HQ]
2980,
2981," COSWORTH: Twenty seconds, missile control. "
2982,"BRIGADIER: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one,"
2983,abort! 
2984,"(KaBOOM! goes the missile, the hangar, and presumably the Keller"
2985,machine and Barnham.)
2986,
2987, [Prison Governor's office]
2988,
2989, (A soldier puts a tray of cups on the desk.) 
2990,BRIGADIER: Thank you. 
2991,JO: We took Barnham there to help us. 
2992,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know, Jo. I know. "
2993,JO: We should never have left him there. 
2994,"DOCTOR: Well, how do you think I feel? "
2995,JO: Sorry. 
2996,"DOCTOR: Yes. Here, have some coffee. "
2997,"BRIGADIER: Well, at least we're rid of the Keller machine, and the"
2998,Master. 
2999,"DOCTOR: Yes, we've probably killed off that machine all right, but I'm"
3000,not so sure about the Master. 
3001,"BRIGADIER: Well, even if he wasn't killed, Doctor, he won't get far if"
3002,you've still got his circuit. 
3003,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's true. "
3004,(The Doctor checks his pockets.) 
3005,DOCTOR: The circuit. I must have lost it in my struggle with him. 
3006,BRIGADIER: Probably destroyed in the explosion. 
3007,"DOCTOR: Yes, but what if it wasn't? Supposing the Master found it? "
3008,(The telephone rings.) 
3009,"BENTON: Hello, Governor's office? "
3010,"MASTER : Put me on to the Doctor, will you? "
3011,"BENTON: Yes. It's for you, Doctor. "
3012,DOCTOR: The Master? Yes?
3013,
3014, [The Master's Tardis]
3015,
3016," MASTER: Ah, Doctor. I was afraid you'd be worried"
3017,"about me, so I thought I'd let you know that I'm alive and well."
3018,
3019, [Prison Governor's office]
3020,
3021, DOCTOR: I'm extremely sorry to hear that.
3022,
3023, [The Master's Tardis]
3024,
3025," MASTER: I made the safety of my Tardis which,"
3026,"thanks to your generosity, is in perfect working order."

3043,DOCTOR: His usual threats. 
3044,"JO: Never mind, Doctor. You've beaten him. "
3045,"DOCTOR: Have I, Jo? He's got his Tardis back. He's free to come and go"
