20, TASHA
21,": Once, there was a planet, much like any other, and unimportant."
22,This planet sent the universe a message. A bell tolling among the
23,"stars, ringing out to all the dark corners of creation. And everybody"
24,came to see. 
25,"(A huge space fleet of Judoon, Terileptils, Silurians et al is orbiting"
26,an icy ringed
27,planet. Three tones are being repeated over and over again.) 
28,"TASHA : Although no one understood the message, everyone who heard"
29,it found themselves afraid. Except one man. The man who stayed for
30,Christmas.
31,
32,[Spaceship]
33,
34,"(The Doctor beams in to a large dark space,"
35,carrying a Dalek eye-stalk.) 
36,DOCTOR: I bring proof of courage and comradeship. What is this ship and
37,why are you here? Identify yourselves by species and planet of origin. 
38,DALEK: Exterminate! 
39,(The Doctor communicates with an unseen accomplice.) 
40,DOCTOR: Handles? 
41,DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! 
42,(The angry pepperpots start firing. Their aim is awful at such short range.) 
43,DOCTOR: Handles? Argh. Handles? 
44,(The Doctor is beamed away.) 
45,DALEKS: Exterminate!
46,
47,[Tardis]
48,
49,"DOCTOR: Every ship I go on, they just shoot at me."
50,"Handles, I said, put me on a ship. I didn't say, put me on a Dalek"
51,ship. 
52,(The Doctor is talking to a damaged Cyberman's head attached to a stand
53,on the console.) 
54,DOCTOR: Don't put me on a Dalek ship when I'm holding a broken bit of
55,Dalek! 
56,(The Doctor hits the head with the eye-stalk.) 
57,DOCTOR: Ow! 
58,HANDLES: You did not indicate a preference. 
59,DOCTOR: Use your head. 
60,(He takes it off the stand and paces with it.) 
61,DOCTOR: It's not like you've got a lot of alternatives. They're all
62,"here. Daleks, Sontarans, Terileptils, Slitheen. And they're not even"
63,"fighting, they're just parked. Why? "
64,HANDLES: The message was received throughout the universe. 
65,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, the message, the message. Even I can't translate it."
66,"I mean, why is everyone here if they don't understand it? "
67,HANDLES: You're here. 
68,"DOCTOR: Well, you know, I'm OCD. What's their excuse? What does this"
69,message mean? 
70,(The emergency phone outside rings. He puts the head back on its
71,stand.) 
72,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. And remind me I've got to patch the telephone back"
73,through the console unit. This is getting ridiculous. 
74,HANDLES: Attention. Information available. 
75,DOCTOR: Okay? 
76,HANDLES: You must patch the telephone device back through the console
77,unit. 
78,"DOCTOR: No, no. No, no, no, no. No, not now. Remind me later. "
79,HANDLES: When? 
80,DOCTOR: I don't know. Just later. Just pick a time. 
81,HANDLES: When? 
82,DOCTOR: I don't know. Just any old time. When you think I've forgotten.
83,
84,HANDLES: When? 
85,"DOCTOR: Just pick a random number, express that number as a quantity of"
86,"minutes, and when that time has elapsed, remind me to patch the"
87,telephone back through the console unit. 
88,HANDLES: Affirmative. 
89,DOCTOR: How those Cyber-evenings must fly. 
90,"(He opens the door, gets the telephone and brings the handset inside.) "
91,"DOCTOR: Hello, the Tardis."
92,
93,[Clara's flat / Tardis]
94,
95,(Clara dashing between cooking and laying a table
96,for dinner whilst wearing the paper crown from a Christmas cracker.) 
97,CLARA: Emergency. You're my boyfriend. 
98,"DOCTOR: Ding dong. Okay, brilliant. I may be a bit rusty in some areas,"
99,but I will glance at a manual. 
100,"CLARA: No, no, you're not actually my boyfriend. "
101,"(The turkey is nowhere near ready, although the roast potatoes look"
102,done.) 
103,"DOCTOR: Oh, that was quick. It's a roller coaster this phone call. "
104,CLARA: But I need a boyfriend really quickly. 
105,"DOCTOR: Well, I hope you're nicer to the next one. "
106,"CLARA: No, shut up. Christmas dinner. Me cooking. "
107,DOCTOR: So? 
108,"CLARA: So, I may have accidentally invented a boyfriend. "
109,"DOCTOR: Yeah, I did that once and there's no easy way to get rid of an"
110,android. 
111,"CLARA: No, not an android. A pretend one, an imaginary one. And I said"
112,he'd be coming to Christmas dinner. 
113,DOCTOR: Yeah. 
114,(The scanner has picked up an unidentified new vessel in orbit. The
115,Doctor drops
116,the telephone receiver.) 
117,"DOCTOR: Handles, that's a new ship. Okay, we'll take the Tardis this"
118,time. 
119,CLARA: I just need you to come for Christmas dinner. Just do that for
120,me. Come to Christmas dinner and be my Christmas date. 
121,"DOCTOR: Sorry, missed that last bit. Got to dash."
122,
123,[New spaceship]
124,
125,"(The Tardis materialises, and the Doctor walks down"
126,a corridor carrying Handles.) 
127,"DOCTOR: Okay, don't be alarmed, I come in "
128,(And sees Cybermen.) 
129,CYBERMAN: Alert. Alert. 
130,DOCTOR: Peace. No. 
131,CYBERMAN: Intruder detected. The intruder will be upgraded. 
132,(Lots of Cybermen leave their cubicles and start shooting. Really bad
133,shots again.) 
134,DOCTOR: Argh! Sorry. 
135,(The Doctor makes it back to the Tardis. He gets inside and the phone
136,"rings, so he pops out to get it again.)"
137,
138,[Clara's flat / Tardis]
139,
140,CLARA: I need you. I'm cooking Christmas dinner! 
141,DOCTOR: I'm being shot at by Cybermen! 
142,"CLARA: Well, can't we do both? "
143,"DOCTOR: Argh! Yeah, why not?"
144,
145,[Clara's flat]
146,
147,(Clara's little family is tucking in to starters
148,and alcohol whilst the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special is on
149,the television. That makes it 5pm. Who on Earth has the television on
150,"during a big family meal, for Zarquon's sake?) "
151,TV: Happy Christmas! 
152,LINDA: How's the turkey doing? 
153,"CLARA: Great. Yeah, yeah, it's doing great. Well, dead and decapitated,"
154,but that's Christmas when you're a turkey. 
155,"GRAN: Actually, maybe I will have a little more. "
156,(Clara refills her glass.) 
157,"CLARA: There you go, Gran. "
158,DAD: Did you put it in early enough? 
159,"CLARA: Dad, I put it in when you phoned me. "
160,DAD: I emailed you some instructions. 
161,"CLARA: Oh, you certainly did. "
162,[Outside the block of flats]
163,
164,(The Tardis materialises noisily outside Clara's
165,"block of flats. She runs down the stairs and outside, losing her paper"
166,crown in the wind.) 
167,CLARA: Whoops!
168,
169,[Tardis]
170,
171,"CLARA: Doctor, I so need you. "
172,(The Doctor is without any clothing. Clara has to turn her back.) 
173,DOCTOR: Clara! 
174,"CLARA: No, stop, stop, don't move. Don't do anything. "
175,DOCTOR: Why? What is it? What's wrong? 
176,CLARA: You're naked. 
177,"DOCTOR: Yes, I am naked. I wondered if you'd notice. "
178,"CLARA: Doctor, why are you naked? "
179,DOCTOR: Because I'm going to church. 
180,(Zap! and he is fully clothed again.) 
181,DOCTOR: Better? 
182,"CLARA: Oh, that was quick. "
183,"DOCTOR: Hologram clothes, projected directly onto your visual cortex. "
184,CLARA: So you're still naked underneath? 
185,DOCTOR: Everybody's naked underneath. 
186,"CLARA: Urgh, don't say things like that. It's Christmas. Come and meet"
187,my family.
188,
189,[Clara's flat]
190,
191,"CLARA: Hello, so, er, here he is. "
192,"DOCTOR: Hello, the Oswalds. Hello! Merry Christmas. Hello, hello. "
193,"(Handshakes for Linda and Dad, air kisses for Gran, who is the only one"
194,to look
195,directly at him.) 
196,"DOCTOR: Hello, handsome. Anyone for Twister? "
197,"CLARA: So, this is the Doctor. My boyfriend. Isn't anyone going to say"
198,hello? 
199,GRAN: Hello. 
200,(Her glass is empty again.) 
201,"DOCTOR: Excuse me a moment. Listen, I've got an idea to break the ice."
202,Why don't I project my clothes hologram onto their visual cortexes too?
203,
204,"CLARA: So, to be clear, no one except me can see your clothes? "
205,"DOCTOR: Yes, and I'm starting to think it may be causing tension. "
206,GRAN: Are we playing Twister now? 
207,CLARA: Get in the kitchen. 
208,DOCTOR: Eh? Sorry. 
209,CLARA: Sorry. He's Swedish.
210,
211,[Kitchen]
212,
213,"CLARA: Doctor, please."
214,(He looks at the anaemic fowl in the over.) 
215,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's never going to work, is it? "
216,CLARA: What's wrong? Do you think it's not done yet? 
217,DOCTOR: I think a decent vet would give it an even chance. 
218,"CLARA: Okay. Well, use an app. "
219,DOCTOR: An app? 
220,CLARA: On your screwdriver. App it. 
221,DOCTOR: Most certainly not. It doesn't do turkey. Nothing does turkey.
222,You'd need a time machine. What?
223,
224,[Tardis]
225,
226,DOCTOR: You can't keep using the Tardis like this. 
227,CLARA: Like what? 
228,(She is carrying the poor uncooked bird.) 
229,"DOCTOR: Missed birthdays, restaurant bookings. And please, just learn"
230,how to use iPlayer. 
231,"CLARA: Ooo, vortex cooking? "
232,(She lays the carcass in the workings below the console.) 
233,"DOCTOR: Yep, exposure to the time winds. It'll either come up a treat,"
234,or just possibly lay some eggs. 
235,HANDLES: Information available. 
236,CLARA: What's that? 
237,"DOCTOR: Oh, just a bit of a Cyberman. He'll get us to the church on"
238,time. 
239,HANDLES: I have developed a fault. 
240,"DOCTOR: The organics are all gone, but there's still a full set of data"
241,banks. Found it at the Maldovar market. 
242,(They zoom back to the snow planet.) 
243,HANDLES: Planet identified from analysis of message. 
244,"DOCTOR: Right, cool. Go on then. Okay, tell us, what is the planet? Go"
245,on. 
246,HANDLES: Processing official designation. Processing. 
247,"DOCTOR: Okay, in your own time, dear. Don't rush. "
248,CLARA: So why haven't you just gone down there and had a look? 
249,DOCTOR: It's shielded. Even the Tardis can't break through it. 
250,HANDLES: Gallifrey. 
251,DOCTOR: What did you say? 
252,HANDLES: Gallifrey. 
253,DOCTOR: What are you talking about? Gallifrey? What do you mean? 
254,"HANDLES: Confirmed. Planet designation, Gallifrey. "
255,(The Doctor grabs Handles and takes it to the scanner.) 
256,DOCTOR: You see that? Gallifrey is my home. I know it when I see it.
257,That is not Gallifrey. 
258,"CLARA: Doctor, are you okay. "
259,DOCTOR: It's not Gallifrey. Gallifrey is gone. 
260,"CLARA: Unless, unless you saved it. You thought you might have. "
261,(They look out of the Tardis doors down at the white planet.) 
262,"DOCTOR: Even if it survived, it's gone from this universe. That is not"
263,my home. 
264,(They go back inside.) 
265,DOCTOR: It can't be. 
266,(There is a big fog horn blast outside.) 
267,CLARA: What's that? 
268,"(They look out of the door again, at a big square Borg-style"
269,spaceship.) 
270,DOCTOR: Papal Mainframe. It's like a great big flying church. The first
271,ship to arrive. They are the ones who shielded the planet. They can get
272,us down there. 
273,(The Doctor bows to a large holographic face.) 
274,CLARA: A friend of yours? 
275,"DOCTOR: Tasha Lem, the Mother Superious. "
276,(The hologram beckons to them.) 
277,"DOCTOR: Oh, she's inviting us aboard. "
278,CLARA: Why? 
279,DOCTOR: Because I asked her. Swallow this. 
280,CLARA: What is it? 
281,DOCTOR: Your hologram projector. You can't go to church with your
282,clothes on. 
283,(The Tardis flies inside the mainframe.)
284,
285,[Papal Mainframe]
286,
287,CLARA: I don't feel like I'm wearing anything. 
288,"DOCTOR: I know. Relaxing, isn't it? "
289,CLARA: What is this place? 
290,(They walk between two rows of military personnel.) 
291,"DOCTOR: The Church of the Papal Mainframe, security hub of the known"
292,universe. 
293,CLARA: A security church? 
294,DOCTOR: Yep. Keeping you safe in this world and the next. I venerate
295,the exaltation of the Mother Superious. 
296,(The Doctor bows low. Clara curtseys. A male Colonel standing near the
297,Mother
298,Superious greets them.) 
299,ALBERO: Welcome to the Church of the Papal Mainframe. Your nudity is
300,appreciated. 
301,"TASHA: Hey, babes. "
302,DOCTOR: Loving the frock. 
303,TASHA: Is that a new body? Give us a twirl. 
304,"DOCTOR: Tash, this old thing? Please, I've been rocking it for"
305,centuries. 
306,TASHA: Nice though. Tight. 
307,"CLARA: So, er, hello. Also here. "
308,"DOCTOR: Clara, this is Tasha Lem, the Head of the Church of the Papal"
309,"Mainframe. Tash, ho, ho, ho, ho. This is my, my associate, Clara"
310,Oswald. Miss Clara Oswald. 
311,"TASHA: We'll go to my chapel. All honours in place, no sacrifices"
312,required.
313,
314,[Corridor]
315,
316,DOCTOR: It was Tasha who shielded the planet. But
317,"you could sneak me down there, couldn't you, Tash? "
318,TASHA: I would have conditions. (to Clara) I have confidential matters
319,to discuss with the Doctor. Would you excuse us? 
320,"DOCTOR: Anything you have to say to me, you can say in front of Clara."
321,"Well, quite a lot of it. Probably about half. Maybe a smidge under."
322,"Actually, Clara, would you mind waiting out here, please? "
323,CLARA: No worries. You two get yourselves a room. 
324,"DOCTOR: Yes, quite. No, stop it. "
325,CLARA: Boss of the psycho space nuns. So you. 
326,(Tasha and the Doctor go into the private chapel.) 
327,DOCTOR: Well. 
328,"(Then she sees a mouthless creature in a suit, with three long fingers,"
329,approaching her.) 
330,CLARA: Doctor?
331,
332,[Chapel]
333,
334,DOCTOR: That altar looks like a bed. 
335,TASHA: That bed looks like an altar. 
336,DOCTOR: Yep. 
337,(He sits on it. Tasha offers him a goblet of blue liquid. He doesn't
338,"like it. She reaches across and touches a panel on the headrest, or is"
339,"it footrest, and the three tone message plays. They get inside each"
340,others personal space.) 
341,TASHA: That message is transmitting through all of space and time. What
342,did it make you feel? 
343,DOCTOR: Feel? 
344,TASHA: Every sentient being in the universe who detected that signal
345,felt something. Something overpowering. 
346,DOCTOR: What? 
347,"TASHA: Fear. Pure, unadulterated dread."
348,
349,[Corridor]
350,
351,(The Silent passes behind a screen then reappears
352,again.) 
353,CLARA: I saw you and then I forgot you. How does that work? 
354,(He goes behind another screen and she forgets it.)
355,
356,[Chapel]
357,
358,DOCTOR: Right. What's the signal? Where's it coming
359,from? 
360,"TASHA: It's a settlement. Human colony, level two. A farm, basically. "
361,DOCTOR: Right. Anyone been for a look? 
362,"TASHA: Any one ship lands, the rest will follow. There will be"
363,"bloodshed. Fortunately we got here first, shielded the planet. We"
364,maintain the truce by blocking all of them. 
365,"DOCTOR: Daleks, Cybermen, one of that lot, could break through your"
366,defences. 
367,"TASHA: Perhaps. But they're afraid, remember? Nobody wants to go first."
368,
369,DOCTOR: I do. 
370,TASHA: I was counting on it.
371,
372,[Corridor]
373,
374,SILENT: Confess. 
375,"(It comes up behind Clara, startling her.) "
376,SILENT: Confess. 
377,CLARA: What are you? Why do I keep forgetting you? 
378,(There are now more of them. She backs up to the chapel door.) 
379,SILENT: Confess. Confess. 
380,CLARA: What? 
381,(And runs into -)
382,
383,[Chapel]
384,
385,DOCTOR: Are you okay? 
386,"CLARA: Fine. Yeah, fine. Sorry. "
387,TASHA: Right. This is my personal teleport. I can put you down just
388,outside the town. Find the source of the message and report back to me
389,"in one hour. And on your life, Doctor, you will cause no trouble down"
390,there. 
391,(The Doctor enters the 'confessional' style teleport box.) 
392,DOCTOR: When do I? Don't answer that. 
393,(He draws the curtain. Tasha pulls it back and holds out her hand.) 
394,DOCTOR: What? 
395,TASHA: I'm not an idiot. Everyone in this church is trained to see
396,straight through holograms. 
397,CLARA: Ah. Great. 
398,TASHA: Give now. You are taking no technology of any kind down there. 
399,"DOCTOR: What can I do with a key? You, in, now. "
400,TASHA: You could summon your Tardis. 
401,DOCTOR: The Tardis doesn't work by remote. Fine. If it makes you feel
402,"any better, there we are. "
403,(The Doctor gives the Tardis key to Tasha as Clara goes into the other
404,cubicle. Tasha works the teleport controls.) 
405,TASHA: Remember. I want you back in one hour.
406,
407,[Forest]
408,
409,(Snow is falling all around as the Doctor and Clara
410,beam in.) 
411,"CLARA: Oh, cold. Very cold. "
412,"DOCTOR: Okay, don't worry. There's a heat loss filter in your hologram"
413,"shell. It'll kick in, just give it a moment. So, sweet little town"
414,"covered in snow, half the universe in terror. Why? Why? "
415,"CLARA: Oh, my God! "
416,DOCTOR: What? 
417,(Clara has spotted an arm sticking out of the snow.) 
418,CLARA: There's something under the snow. It's 
419,DOCTOR: What is it? 
420,CLARA: It's cold. 
421,"DOCTOR: Okay, just stand back please, Clara. "
422,CLARA: It's stone. It's just stone. It's only a statue. 
423,"DOCTOR: Clara, step away from it! "
424,(The hand grabs her ankle.) 
425,"DOCTOR: Clara, keep looking at it. Don't look away. Don't even blink! "
426,CLARA: What is it? 
427,DOCTOR: There is a Weeping Angel under the snow. It looks like a
428,"statue, isn't a statue. Can you get your foot out? "
429,CLARA: Only if I get it out of my shoe. 
430,DOCTOR: You're not wearing a shoe. 
431,CLARA: Good point. 
432,"DOCTOR: Okay, pull hard. One, two, three! "
433,(She comes free and they tumble backwards. Lots of Angels are starting
434,to emerge from the snowdrifts.) 
435,"CLARA: They're climbing out of the snow. Oh, God! "
436,DOCTOR: Keep looking at the. At all of them. 
437,CLARA: Why? 
438,DOCTOR: Quantum locked lifeform. It can only move if it's unobserved. 
439,CLARA: What is it doing here? 
440,DOCTOR: Same as everybody else. Must've got past Tasha's shield. 
441,"(They are surrounded, and cannot look at every Angel all of the time.) "
442,DOCTOR: Keep looking! 
443,(The Angels advance.) 
444,CLARA: I can't. I can't see. The snow's in my eyes. 
445,DOCTOR: I just need to bring the Tardis down. 
446,CLARA: You can't fly it remotely. 
447,"DOCTOR: No, but it can home in on the key. "
448,CLARA: But she took your key! 
449,DOCTOR: She took one of them. 
450,(The Doctor pulls off his wig to reveal a spare glowing Tardis key.) 
451,[Tardis]
452,
453,HANDLES: Engines activating. 
454,(The Tardis materialises around them.) 
455,DOCTOR: The old key in the quiff routine. Classic. 
456,(He puts his wig on Handles.) 
457,"DOCTOR: Okay, homing in on the mysterious message. Ooo yes, I like"
458,that. The mysterious message. 
459,CLARA: You've shaved your head? 
460,DOCTOR: Yep. Clever plan to get us past the shield. 
461,"CLARA: You got bored one night, didn't you? "
462,"DOCTOR: Yeah, tiny bit bored. "
463,CLARA: Is that what happened to your eyebrows? 
464,"DOCTOR: No, they're just delicate. Right, setting us down near the"
465,signal source. I'm going to turn the engines on silent. Don't want to
466,make a fuss. 
467,CLARA: Put it back on. 
468,DOCTOR: Why? 
469,CLARA: Your ears are like rocket fins. 
470,DOCTOR: I know.
471,
472,[Town]
473,
474,"CLARA: Oh, it's good to be wearing clothes again."
475,"That's so much better, don't you think? "
476,(They are dressed for the weather. The Doctor scans everything with his
477,screwdriver. The trees are decorated with
478,lights so the village has electricity at least.) 
479,"DOCTOR: Now, what do we make of this place? It's two o'clock in the"
480,afternoon. Must be very short days here. The message is coming from
481,that tower. 
482,(Two residents walk towards them.) 
483,"DOCTOR: Hello! Hello, there. Right, we're a couple from the next town."
484,"My name's probably Hank or Rock, something like that. "
485,CLARA: Or Daisy? 
486,"DOCTOR: Shut up. Hello, good to meet you. Nice snow. "
487,ABRAMAL: Most pleasant to meet you too. 
488,MARTA: Most pleasant. Most pleasant. 
489,DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. I'm a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey. I
490,stole a time machine and ran away and I've been flouting the principal
491,law of my own people every since. That wasn't quite what I was meant to
492,say! 
493,(Everyone laughs.) 
494,"CLARA: I'm an English teacher from planet Earth, and I've run off with"
495,a man from space because I really fancy 
496,"MARTA: I think, perhaps, you should stop talking till you get used to"
497,it. 
498,DOCTOR: Used to what? 
499,MARTA: What did you say your name was? 
500,CLARA: Bubbly personality masking bossy control freak. 
501,"DOCTOR: I'm wearing a wig! No, ah, I see. Yes, of course. It's a truth"
502,"field. Oh, that is so quaint. I haven't seen a truth field in years."
503,I'm wearing a wig. 
504,ABRAMAL: No one can lie in this town. Especially this close to the
505,tower. 
506,(The couple walk on.) 
507,DOCTOR: Doesn't that make life a bit difficult? 
508,MARTA: Not at all. 
509,ABRAMAL: Yes. 
510,"DOCTOR: This town, what's it called? "
511,MARTA: It's Christmas. 
512,DOCTOR: It's July. 
513,"MARTA: No, the town. The town is Christmas. That's what it's called. "
514,ABRAMAL: Be happy here. Be well. 
515,CLARA: How can a town be called Christmas? 
516,DOCTOR: I don't know. How can an island be called Easter? Maybe it's
517,just nice here. I almost hate to find out what's wrong. 
518,(The three tones sing out across the roof tops.)
519,
520,[Tower]
521,
522,DOCTOR: There you are. What took you so long? 
523,CLARA: What's wrong? It's only a crack in the wall. 
524,"(It is The Crack, the time field caused by the exploding Tardis in the"
525,Pandorica Opens / Big Bang
526,"stories, that haunted the first season with Amy Pond.) "
527,DOCTOR: I knew. I always knew it wasn't over. 
528,CLARA: What is it? 
529,DOCTOR: A split in the skin of reality. 
530,"(As he touches it, he is remembers other times the crack was there.) "
531,"DOCTOR: A tiny sliver of the 26th of June, 2010. The day the universe"
532,blew up. 
533,CLARA: Missed that. 
534,"DOCTOR: I rebooted it, put it all back together. "
535,CLARA: That's good. 
536,"DOCTOR: Well, it was my Tardis that blew it up in the first place. I"
537,felt a degree of responsibility. But the scar tissue remains. A
538,structural weakness in the whole universe. Whoa! And someone's trying
539,"to get through it from outside our universe, from somewhere else. Of"
540,course. Of course. It makes sense. 
541,CLARA: It does? 
542,"DOCTOR: Yes. If you were trying to break through a wall, you'd choose"
543,"the weakest spot. If you were trying to break into this universe, you'd"
544,"choose this crack, because. No. If you were trying to break back into"
545,this universe. (to Handles) You said Gallifrey. Why did you say
546,Gallifrey? 
547,"HANDLES: Analysis of message composition indicates Gallifreyan origin,"
548,according to Tardis databanks. 
549,CLARA: You said Gallifrey was gone. 
550,DOCTOR: No. I said it was in another universe. The message is coming
551,"through here. The truth field is too, at a guess. If it's the Time"
552,Lords.
553,If it's the Time Lords. 
554,(He takes a large round item from his trouser pocket.)
555,DOCTOR: Seal of the High Council of Gallifrey. Nicked it off the Master
556,in the Death Zone. (Five Doctors) There is an algorithm imprinted in
557,the atomic structure. Use it to decode the message. 
558,(He puts the Seal on Handle's forehead.) 
559,HANDLES: Message decoding. Message analysis proceeding. Information
560,available. The message is a request for information. 
561,DOCTOR: It's a question. Why can't you just say it's a question? 
562,HANDLES: It is being projected through all of time and space on a
563,repeating cycle. 
564,"DOCTOR: The oldest question in the universe, hidden in plain sight. "
565,HANDLES: Warning. Translation will be available to all lifeforms in
566,range. Translation follows. Doctor who? (slightly different voice each
567,time.) Doctor who? Doctor who? Doctor who? Doctor who? Doctor who?

574,TASHA: Patch me through to the Doctor. Now!
575,
576,[Tower]
577,
578,DOCTOR: A question only I could answer. A truth
579,"field to make sure I'm not lying. If I give my name, they'll know"
580,they've found the right place and that it's safe to come through. 
581,"CLARA: The Time Lords? Okay, so what then? If you answer the question"
582,"and they come back, what happens? "
583,(The Doctor gives Clara a short round device.) 
584,"DOCTOR: Er, you need to take this to the Tardis and put it in the"
585,charger slot for the sonic. 
586,CLARA: Why? 
587,"DOCTOR: Hell. All hell, that's what happens if the Time Lords come"
588,"back. There's half a universe up there already, waiting to open fire."
589,"Now please, go to the Tardis and just do as I say. "
590,(Clara runs.) 
591,TASHA : Doctor.
592,

594,
595,TASHA: Speak with me. 
596,(Tasha's holographic face hangs large in the sky.)

600,
601,TASHA : Doctor! 
602,"(The Doctor goes up to the bell chamber above the clock face, which is"
603,very open
604,to the elements and appears to house just the one bell.) 
605,"DOCTOR: Mother Superious, there is only one thing I need from you. This"
606,"planet, what's it called? "
607,TASHA: Trenzalore.

611,"CLARA: Okay, is that it? Are you doing a clever"
612,thing?
613,(The Tardis engines are running.)

616,
617,"TASHA: If you speak your name, the Time Lords will"
618,return. 
619,"DOCTOR: If they return, they will come in peace. "
620,TASHA: It doesn't matter. They will be met with a war that will never
621,"end. The Time War will begin anew. You know that, Doctor."
622,
623,[Tardis]
624,
625,(The engines stop.) 
626,CLARA: Done. 
627,(And runs outside to -)

631,"CLARA: No. Don't you dare. No, no! "
632,(The Tardis is starting to dematerialise as she puts her key into the

635,[Bell chamber]
636,
637,DOCTOR: They're asking for my help! 
638,"TASHA: And if you give it, war will be the consequence. I will not let"
639,"that happen, at any cost. Speak your name and this world will burn. "
640,"DOCTOR: No, this planet is protected. "
641,(He rings the bell.)
642,
643,[Town]
644,
645,(The residents gather. The Doctor comes out of the
646,Tower.) 
647,"DOCTOR: So, you lot, a quick word, thank you. Spot of news. Christmas"
648,"has a new sheriff. Hello, everyone. I'm the Doctor."
649,
650,[Papal Mainframe]
651,
652,TASHA: Attention. Attention all Chapels and Choirs
653,of the Papal Mainframe. The siege of Trenzalore is now begun. There
654,"will now be an unscheduled faith change. From this moment on, I"
655,dedicate this church to one cause. Silence. The Doctor will not speak
656,"his name, and war will not begin. Silence will fall! "
657,ALL: Silence will fall! Silence will fall. 
658,"TASHA : In the time that followed, the Papal"
659,Mainframe strove to maintain the peace between the Doctor and his
660,enemies.

664,(A set of vehicle tracks is appearing in the snow
665,on the road into town.)
666,SKARR: We remain undetectable to the Papal Mainframe. 
667,(The Doctor uses his screwdriver and we see the upper halves of two
668,"Sontarans. Clearly, they are clones of the same cell line as Strax.) "
669,SONTARAN: Commander Skarr. That's the detection warning. Our
670,invisibility cloak is compromised. 
671,SKARR: What's wrong with it? 
672,SONTARAN: I don't know. I can't see it. 
673,"SKARR: Well, it looks invisible to me. "
674,"(He hits the side of the semi-visible vehicle. Whoosh, kaBOOM!) "
675,ALBERO : The Church of the Papal Mainframe apologises for your
676,death. The relevant afterlives have been notified. 
677,"TASHA : As the days passed, and the years, the"
678,"Doctor stayed true to his word. On the fields of Trenzalore, he stood"
679,as protector both of his own people and his new home. 
680,"(The Weeping Angels have mirrors placed in front of them, with With"
681,Love from the Doctor written on them.) 
682,[Town]
683,
684,"TASHA : Over the years, his foes would find"
685,"new, stranger ways to enter the town called Christmas. "
686,(The children are playing a game of blind man's bluff. The blindfolded
687,"boy wanders around a little, then hears timbers creaking.) "
688,BARNABLE: Are you there? Hello? Am I getting warm? 
689,(The lad removes his blindfold to look up at a dull brown creaking
690,Cyberman. He runs away.) 
691,BARNABLE: There's another one! 
692,(The Cyberman's flame thrower misses him.) 
693,BARNABLE: There's another one! There's another one! 
694,(He rings alarm bells and the townspeople come out.) 
695,"BARNABLE: There's another one! Doctor, Doctor! There's another one! "
696,CYBERMAN: Incinerate. Incinerate. 
697,"(An older Doctor, leaning on a cane, comes out of his Tower home.) "
698,CYBERMAN: The Doctor is required. 
699,(The Doctor throws a wooden rifle to Barbable.) 
700,"DOCTOR: There you go, Barnable. "
701,BARNABLE: Thanks. 
702,DOCTOR: Working fine. Nice action. Don't leave it out in the rain again.
703,(A wheeled toy is tossed to another child.) 
704,DOCTOR: Fixed the wheels and the antigrav. 
705,GIRL: The anti what? 
706,"DOCTOR: Yeah, may have gone a bit far. Now then, what do we have today?"
707,Don't you move one step further. Wooden Cyberman. Nice. Like it. 
708,(He limps over to his foe.) 
709,"DOCTOR: Low tech, doesn't set off the alarms upstairs. "
710,(There is a brief High Noon moment between the town sheriff and the
711,"newcomer, then the Doctor zaps it with his screwdriver before it"
712,manages to raise its creaky arm.) 
713,"DOCTOR: Only bit of tech allowed in. Got in before the truce. Now, I"
714,just sent an instruction to your firearm to reverse the polarity and
715,"fire out the back end. Now, as we're standing in a truth field, you"
716,"will understand I cannot be lying. If you like, you can scan my"
717,"screwdriver, verify that's the signal I sent. "
718,CYBERMAN: Signal verified. 
719,(The Cyberman's arm weapon turns around and fires its flamethrower
720,through its chest.) 
721,DOCTOR: Yes. I probably should have mentioned this doesn't work on
722,wood. You send your friends up there a message from the Doctor. You
723,tell them the Doctor stays. 
724,(He prods the Cyberman with his cane and it falls backwards.) 
725,DOCTOR: Next. 
726,(The village has a party to celebrate this triumph.) 
727,"TASHA : With every victory, the town celebrated. "
728,DOCTOR: And there's me arm-wrestling a Draconian. I remember that. 
729,"TASHA : In time, the Doctor seemed to forget he'd lived any other"
730,life. 
731,DOCTOR: Christmas is defended. 
732,(He pins up children's drawings of their defeated enemies in the
733,Tower.) 
734,TASHA : And the people of the town came to love the man who stayed
735,for Christmas. 
736,DOCTOR: You've got to be the drunk giraffe. You've got to commit! Don't
737,"be cool, guys. Cool is not cool. "
738,CHILDREN: Cool is not cool! 
739,DOCTOR: And what's the dance we're doing? 
740,CHILDREN: The drunk giraffe! 
741,"DOCTOR: The drunk giraffe. Yeah, it is. Merry Christmas. Give me a hug."
742,Bring it in. 
743,CHILDREN: Yeah! 
744,(The Doctor mingles.) 
745,DOCTOR: How's your father's barn? 
746,"BARNABLE: You've fixed the leak all right, but he says it's bigger on"
747,the inside now. 
748,"DOCTOR: Shush, they'll all want one. "
749,(There is the sound of a wheezing time rotor.) 
750,BARNABLE: What is it? What's that noise. 
751,(The Tardis is trying to materialise.) 
752,DOCTOR: Well. Where have you been for three hundred years? Ha! 
753,BARNABLE: What's that? 
754,DOCTOR: It's my ship. 
755,BARNABLE: Your what? 
756,DOCTOR: It's my Tardis. That's how I got here in the first place. 
757,BARNABLE: Does this mean you're leaving? 
758,"(The Tardis fully materialises, with Clara still on the outside holding"
759,her key in the lock. He taps her on the back with his cane.) 
760,DOCTOR: What are you doing here? 
761,CLARA: I was in space. 
762,"DOCTOR: Well, you were in the time vortex. She must have extended the"
763,"force field. No wonder. No wonder she's late, dragging you around. "
764,(They walk away from the Tardis.) 
765,CLARA: You tricked me. 
766,DOCTOR: I saved you. 
767,CLARA: You didn't even say goodbye! 
768,DOCTOR: I'm furious with you! 
769,"CLARA: Well, I am not even talking to you! "
770,(They laugh and hug.)
771,
772,[Tower]
773,
774,CLARA: Ha. 
775,(She looks at the drawings and his workbench.) 
776,"CLARA: Oh, Doctor. Fixing toys and fighting monsters. "
777,DOCTOR: The turkey isn't done yet. 
778,CLARA: Is it still asking the question? 
779,"DOCTOR: Oh, never stops. Come upstairs. It's almost time. "
780,CLARA: What for? 
781,DOCTOR: Dawn. The light here lasts only a few minutes. You don't want
782,to miss it.
783,
784,[Bell chamber]
785,
786,(He carries Handles up the stairs. A small fire is
787,burning in the chamber.) 
788,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a standoff. They can't attack in case I unleash the"
789,"Time Lords, and I can't run away, because they'll burn this planet to"
790,"stop the Time Lords. Hey, after all these years, I've finally found"
791,somewhere that needs me to stick around. A town called Christmas.
792,"Could've been worse. Right, there you go, buddy. Comfy? "
793,HANDLES: Comfort is irrelevant. 
794,"DOCTOR: How's that, is that better? "
795,HANDLES: Affirmative. 
796,"DOCTOR: You just take it easy, buddy. He's getting old. I do my best"
797,"for him, but I just can't get the parts, you know. Hey, I know the"
798,feeling. 
799,(He is roasting marshmallows on the open fire.) 
800,CLARA: Where did you get those? 
801,DOCTOR: I have a supplier. The pink ones are best. 
802,HANDLES: I have developed a fault. 
803,"DOCTOR: Hey, don't you worry, Handles. you're just dreaming. The sun's"
804,coming up very soon. You just hang on in there. 
805,"HANDLES: I have developed a fault. I, I have developed a fault. "
806,"DOCTOR: Hey, Handles. Come on. Come on. One more dawn, you can do it."
807,"You've got it in you. Come on, just hang on in there. "
808,HANDLES: Attention. Emergency. Attention. 
809,"DOCTOR: Handles, what is it? What's wrong? "
810,HANDLES: Urgent action required. You must patch the telephone device
811,back through the console unit. 
812,(Handles' lights go out.) 
813,"DOCTOR: Come back. Handles? Handles. Oh. Thank you, Handles, and well"
814,"done. Well done, mate. "
815,"(The sun rises between the mountains, and birds sing to greet it.) "
816,DOCTOR: What do you think of my new place? I come up here once a day
817,"for a few minutes, to remind myself of what it is I'm protecting. "
818,CLARA: It's beautiful. Why did you send me away? 
819,"DOCTOR: Because if I hadn't, I'd have buried you a long time ago. "
820,"CLARA: No, you wouldn't. I would never have let you get stuck here. "
821,"DOCTOR: Ha! Everyone gets stuck somewhere eventually, Clara. Everything"
822,ends. 
823,CLARA: Except you. 
824,DOCTOR: Have you been paying attention? I'm an old man now. 
825,CLARA: But you don't die. You change. You pop right back up with a new
826,face. 
827,"DOCTOR: No, not for ever. I can change twelve times. Thirteen versions"
828,of me. Thirteen silly Doctors. 
829,"CLARA: Okay, so you're number eleven, so "
830,"DOCTOR: Ha. Are we forgetting Captain Grumpy, eh? I didn't call myself"
831,"the Doctor during the Time War, but it was still a regeneration. "
832,"CLARA: Okay, so you're number twelve. "
833,"DOCTOR: Well, number ten once regenerated and kept the same face. I had"
834,"vanity issues at the time. Twelve regenerations, Clara. I can't ever do"
835,"it again. This is where I end up. This face, this version of me. We saw"
836,"this planet in the future, remember? All those graves, one of them"
837,mine. 
838,(The sun is setting.) 
839,CLARA: Change the future. 
840,DOCTOR: I can't. 
841,CLARA: You've got your Tardis back. 
842,"DOCTOR: Ha! You think I'm just going to fly away, abandon everyone? "
843,CLARA: Of course not. But you've been protecting this town for over
844,three hundred years. Do you not think it's anybody else's go yet? 
845,DOCTOR: There is no one else to protect it. 
846,"CLARA: It's not going to be you for ever. It'll end the same way,"
847,whatever you do. 
848,DOCTOR: Every life I save is a victory. Every single one. 
849,"CLARA: What about your life? Just for once, after all this time, have"
850,you not earned the right to think about that? Sorry. Wrong thing to
851,say. We shouldn't be having an argument. 
852,"DOCTOR: Clara, I've been having that argument for the last three"
853,"hundred years, all by myself. "
854,CLARA: But you didn't have your Tardis. 
855,"DOCTOR: Ah. Yes, well, that made it easier to stay. True. "
856,(Thunder in the darkening sky.) 
857,TASHA : Doctor! 
858,DOCTOR: Ah. Look who's woken up. 
859,(The holographic face is in the sky.) 
860,TASHA: The Church of the Silence requests parlay. Your rights and
861,safety are sanctified. 
862,DOCTOR: I'll be right up. 
863,TASHA: I'm sending a transporter. 
864,"DOCTOR: Nah, don't bother. I've got me motor back. "
865,CLARA: It's gone dark. 
866,"DOCTOR: Yeah, well, the sun's gone down. "
867,CLARA: Already?

884,CLARA: What are those things? 
885,SILENT: Confess.

887,you forget everything you told them.

893,places a big box in front of the Doctor. He looks inside.)

896,TASHA: E numbers. You're hyper enough as it is. 
897,"CLARA: So, this is sweet. Middle of a siege and you two have little"
898,chats?

911,[Chapel]
912,
913,TASHA: Why did you ever come to Trenzalore? 
914,"DOCTOR: Well, I did come to Trenzalore, and nothing can change that"
915,"now. Didn't stop you trying though, did it? "
916,TASHA: Not me. The Kovarian Chapter broke away. They travelled back
917,along your timeline and tried to prevent you ever reaching Trenzalore. 
918,DOCTOR: So that's who blew up my Tardis. I thought I'd left the bath
919,running. 
920,"TASHA: They blew up your time capsule, created the very cracks in the"
921,universe through which the Time Lords are now calling. 
922,DOCTOR: The destiny trap. You can't change history if you're part of
923,it. 
924,TASHA: They engineered a psychopath to kill you. 
925,DOCTOR: Totally married her. I'd never have made it here alive without
926,River Song. 
927,"TASHA: I'm not interested in changing history, Doctor. I want to change"
928,the future. The Daleks send for reinforcements daily. They are massing
929,"for war. Three days ago, they attacked the Mainframe itself. "
930,DOCTOR: They attacked here? 
931,CLARA: How did you stop them? 
932,TASHA: Stop them? It was slaughter. 
933,DOCTOR: Why didn't you call me? I could have helped. 
934,"TASHA: I tried. I died in this room, screaming your name. "
935,DOCTOR: No. 
936,TASHA: Oh. I died. It's funny the things that slip your mind. Ah!

942,DALEK: Information concerning the Doctor was harvested from the cadaver
943,of Tasha Lem. 
944,DOCTOR: Bet she never told you how to break through the Trenzalore
945,"forcefield, though. She'd have died first. "
946,DALEK 2: Several times. 
947,"DOCTOR: Well, you'd better kill me, then. Go on. But before you do "
948,(He sonicks the message into the room.) 
949,VOICE : Doctor who? Doctor who? Doctor who? 
950,DOCTOR: I'm a tough old bird. I'll be ages dying. Way enough time to
951,"answer a question. And, oh dear, what happens then, boys? "
952,"(Tasha grabs Clara's neck from behind, and energy plays over her"
953,hands.) 
954,"DALEK: You will die in silence, Doctor, or your associate will die. "
955,"DOCTOR: Fine, go on, kill her. Kill her! See if I care. But tell me,"
956,what you are going to do next? 
957,DALEK: See how the Time Lord betrays. 
958,CLARA: You'll kill me anyway. What difference does it make? I'm not
959,afraid. I'll leave that to you. 
960,"DOCTOR: You see, Tasha, that's what I'm talking about. That is a woman!"
961,"I always knew you were a bit spineless, you and your pointless church."
962,Why did I ever rely on you? Never trust a nun to do a Doctor's work. 
963,"(Tasha turns on the Doctor, releasing Clara, and slaps him. Then she"
964,blasts the Daleks into flames.) 
965,DOCTOR: And she's back! 
966,(The Doctor kisses Tasha. The eyestalk goes back into her forehead
967,leaving a scar.) 
968,DOCTOR: You never could resist a row. 
969,TASHA: Kiss me when I ask. 
970,"DOCTOR: Well, you'd better ask nicely. "
971,TASHA: In your dreams. 
972,"DOCTOR: Right, get us back to the Tardis. Can you do that? "
973,"TASHA: Yeah, but quickly, the Dalek inside me is waking. "
974,DOCTOR: Fight it. 
975,TASHA: I can't. 
976,DOCTOR: Listen to me. You have been fighting the psychopath inside you
977,"all your life. Shut up and win. That is an order, Tasha Lem. "
978,(The Doctor and Clara get into the confessional teleport booths.) 
979,"TASHA: The forcefield will hold for a while, but it will decay, and"
980,there are breaches already. 
981,"DOCTOR: Then this isn't a siege any more, it's a war. It's all up to"
982,"you now. Fight the Daleks, inside and out. You can do it, I know you"
983,can. 
984,"TASHA: Oh, I see. You've got your Tardis back, haven't you? Time to fly"
985,away. 
986,"DOCTOR: Tasha, please. Please. Thank you. "
987,"TASHA: None of this was for you, you fatuous egotist. It was for the"
988,"peace. Fly away, Doctor!"
989,
990,[Tardis]
991,
992,(The Tardis lands. A bell goes ting!) 
993,DOCTOR: It's done. 
994,CLARA: What is? 
995,DOCTOR: Your turkey. Either that or its woken up. 
996,CLARA: Do you want some? 
997,"DOCTOR: Go on, then. "
998,CLARA: Got any plates? 
999,"DOCTOR: Do you know, I've even got Christmas crackers. "
1000,"CLARA: One thing. Give me those big sad eyes, look at me so I know"
1001,"you're not lying, and tell me you will never send me away ever again. "
1002,"DOCTOR: Clara Oswald, I will never send you away again. "
1003,(Clara kisses his cheek and goes down to get the turkey.) 
1004,CLARA: Turkey smells good! 
1005,"DOCTOR: Yeah, smells great. "
1006,(The Doctor looks at young Barnable on the scanner.) 
1007,CLARA: Perfect. 
1008,(He puts the device into the charger as Clara removes the well done
1009,turkey from the vortex cooker.) 
1010,CLARA: Merry Christmas.
1011,(When she comes back up the stairs -) 
1012,CLARA: Doctor? 
1013,(And goes outside to her block of flats. The Tardis dematerialises
1014,behind her.)
1015,
1016,[Town]
1017,
1018,"BARNABLE: If you're not leaving, why did you bring"
1019,it back? 
1020,"DOCTOR: It's a reminder. Besides, I might leave tomorrow. Or the next"
1021,day. Or the day after that. 
1022,(Time passes. Metal Cybermen beam in and start shooting. The villagers
1023,scream and run as the Papal troops and Silents fight back.) 
1024,"TASHA : And so, to the fields of Trenzalore came all the Time"
1025,"Lord's enemies. For this was the winter of the Doctor. In time, when"
1026,"all other races had retreated or burned, only the Church of the"
1027,Mainframe remained in the path of the Daleks. And so those ancient
1028,"enemies, the Doctor and the Silence, stood back to back on the fields"
1029,of Trenzalore.
1030,
1031,[Clara's flat]
1032,
1033,(It was not a happy meal.)
1034,"TOY PENGUIN: Merry Christmas, everyone. Merry Christmas, everyone. "
1035,"LINDA: Other fish in the sea, that's what I'm saying. "
1036,"DAD: Linda, I don't think Clara wants to talk about it. "
1037,"LINDA: I've got a suggestion, that's all. I've got a list of"
1038,suggestions. 
1039,DAD: Linda. 
1040,LINDA: You could make a boy band out of my list. 
1041,CLARA: I hate boy bands. 
1042,"LINDA: Of course you don't, not at your age. "
1043,GRAN: These crackers are rubbish. 
1044,LINDA: I bought them. 
1045,GRAN: I know. 
1046,LINDA: They're classy. 
1047,GRAN: They don't have jokes. 
1048,LINDA: Exactly. 
1049,GRAN: They've got poems. 
1050,LINDA: They're more dramatic crackers. 
1051,GRAN: I like the jokes. 
1052,"CLARA: Tell us a joke, Gran. You know loads of jokes. "
1053,LINDA: I think we're probably talking about my list now. 
1054,CLARA: Probably not. 
1055,DAD: Tell us how you met Dad. The thing about the pigeon. 
1056,GRAN: I saw him on a pier on a rainy day. 
1057,"DAD: No, no, not that one. The one about the pigeon. "
1058,"GRAN: I'd seen him before, lots of times, but he just looked so"
1059,beautiful standing there. 
1060,DAD: The pigeon in the restaurant. You remember? 
1061,GRAN: I wanted everything to stop. I wanted nothing to change ever
1062,again. 
1063,(Clara starts crying.) 
1064,"GRAN: If he could just keep standing there, so beautiful. A long time"
1065,"ago. Don't hug me so tight, dear. You'll break something. "
1066,"LINDA: Oh, that's nice. Crying at Christmas. "
1067,CLARA: Sorry. 
1068,GRAN: I hope you made a wish. 
1069,(The sound of a time rotor is heard. Clara gets up and runs out to the
1070,kitchen window to see the Tardis appearing.) 
1071,"DAD: Clara? What's wrong, Clara. "
1072,CLARA: Everybody just stay put. 
1073,(She grabs a cracker from the table and leaves.)
1074,
1075,[Tardis]
1076,
1077,(The Doctor is not inside. A woman is.) 
1078,CLARA: You can fly the Tardis? 
1079,TASHA: Flying the Tardis was always easy. It was flying the Doctor I
1080,never quite mastered. 
1081,CLARA: What's happened to him?
1082,
1083,[Town]
1084,
1085,(Everything is in flames as people run to and fro.)
1086,
1087,CLARA: What am I supposed to do? 
1088,TASHA: He shouldn't die alone. Go to him.
1089,
1090,[Tower]
1091,
1092,(The Doctor is working on a wooden dog.) 
1093,DOCTOR: Barnable? 
1094,CLARA: Clara. 
1095,(A venerable Doctor with thin grey hair drops the toy and looks around
1096,in his chair.) 
1097,"CLARA: Hello, Doctor. "
1098,DOCTOR: Were you always so young? 
1099,"CLARA: Nah, that was you. "
1100,DOCTOR: Ah. 
1101,(He kisses her hand.) 
1102,[Town]
1103,
1104,DALEK: Seek the Doctor.
1105,
1106,[Tower]
1107,
1108,CLARA: Merry Christmas. 
1109,DOCTOR: Merry Christmas. 
1110,"(They try to pull the cracker, but his hand isn't strong enough.) "
1111,"CLARA: Hey, it's okay. It's all right, don't worry. "
1112,(She helps him make the cracker go bang.) 
1113,DOCTOR: Ah! Is there a joke? Ha? 
1114,(Clara reads the slip of paper.) 
1115,CLARA: Extract from Thoughts on a Clock by Eric Ritchie junior. 
1116,DOCTOR: Is it a knock knock one? Those are best. 
1117,CLARA: I don't think so. 
1118,"DOCTOR: Well, read it. Go on. "
1119,"CLARA: And now it's time for one last bow, like all your other selves."
1120,Eleven's hour is over now. The clock is striking twelve's. 
1121,DOCTOR: I don't get it. 
1122,DALEK : Doctor! The Doctor will be brought! 
1123,(A huge Dalek Mothership hovers over the village.) 
1124,DALEK : The Daleks demand the Doctor. 
1125,(A young man runs in.) 
1126,"YOUNG MAN: They're here. The Daleks, we can't stop them. They want you."
1127,
1128,"DOCTOR: Oh, all right, Barnable. Are you Barnable? "
1129,"YOUNG MAN: No, Doctor. "
1130,"DOCTOR: It's okay, Barnable, don't worry. I have got a plan. Off you"
1131,pop. 
1132,(The young man leaves to the sounds of explosions outside.) 
1133,"DOCTOR: I haven't got a plan, but people love it when I say that. "
1134,"CLARA: Doctor, what are you going to do? "
1135,"DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know. Talk very fast, hope something good happens,"
1136,take the credit. That's generally how it works. 
1137,CLARA: Doctor 
1138,"DOCTOR: Not this time, though. This is it. "
1139,CLARA: No! 
1140,"DOCTOR: Yes. We saw the future, Clara. This is how it ends. "
1141,CLARA: Change it. 
1142,DOCTOR: Ha. 
1143,"CLARA: Like Tasha said, change the future. "
1144,"DOCTOR: I could have once, when there were Time Lords. Not any more."
1145,
1146,[Town]
1147,
1148,(The Daleks are by the Tardis.) 
1149,DALEK: Locate the Doctor.
1150,
1151,[Tower]
1152,
1153,DOCTOR: No. You're going to stay here. Promise me
1154,you will. 
1155,CLARA: Why? 
1156,DOCTOR: I'll be keeping you safe. One last victory. Allow me that. Give
1157,"me that, my impossible girl. Thank you. And goodbye. "
1158,(He wipes away her tears and totters off up the stairs.) 
1159,"DOCTOR: The trouble with Daleks is, they take so long to say anything."
1160,Probably die of boredom before they shoot me. 
1161,DALEK : The Doctor is required! 
1162,(Clara goes to the crack in the wall.) 
1163,"CLARA: Listen to me, you lot. Listen! Help him. Help him change the"
1164,future. Do it. Do something. 
1165,DALEK : Doctor! 
1166,"CLARA: You've been asking a question, and it's time someone told you"
1167,"you've been getting it wrong. His name, his name is the Doctor. All the"
1168,name he needs. Everything you need to know about him. And if you love
1169,"him, and you should, help him. Help him. "
1170,"(Clara finally turns away, then the crack snaps shut. She runs outside"
1171,"to join the villagers and the Daleks, who are looking up at the Doctor"
1172,in the bell chamber.)
1173,
1174,[Bell chamber]
1175,
1176,DOCTOR: Sorry I'm a bit slow. I may not be at my
1177,best right now. 
1178,"DALEK : You are dying, Doctor. "
1179,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm dying. You've been trying to kill me for centuries,"
1180,"and here I am, dying of old age. If you want something done, do it"
1181,yourself. 
1182,"DALEK : You will die, and the Time Lords will never return. "
1183,"DOCTOR: You still can't work up the courage to shoot me, can you?"
1184,"You're still worried I've got something up my sleeve. Well, you knock"
1185,"yourselves out, boys. I've got nothing this time. "
1186,"(Flying Daleks fire at the troops on the ground, making the townsfolk"
1187,scream. Then the crack opens in the sky and
1188,golden regeneration energy enters the Doctor's mouth. His eyes widen in
1189,surprise and his hands begin to glow.) 
1190,"DALEK : You will die now, Doctor. This is the end of you. "
1191,(The crack disappears.) 
1192,DALEK : The rules of regeneration are known. You have expended all
1193,your lives. 
1194,"DOCTOR: Sorry, what did you say? Did you mention the rules? Now,"
1195,listen. Bit of advice. Tell me the truth if you think you know it. Lay
1196,"down the law if you're feeling brave. But, Daleks, never, ever tell me"
1197,the rules! 
1198,DALEK : Emergency! Emergency! The Doctor is regenerating! 
1199,(The Tower clock strikes twelve. The Doctor is feeling more youthful
1200,"already,"
1201,although he doesn't look it.) 
1202,DALEK : The Doctor is regenerating! 
1203,"DOCTOR: Oh, look at this. Regeneration number thirteen. We're breaking"
1204,"some serious science here, boys. I tell you what, it's going to be a"
1205,whopper! 
1206,DALEK : Exterminate! Exterminate the Doctor. 
1207,"DOCTOR: You think you can stop me now, Daleks? If you want my life, ha,"
1208,"ha, come and get it! "
1209,(The Doctor winds up his arm and fires a big stream of energy out from
1210,his hand.)
1211,
1212,[Town]
1213,
1214,"CLARA: Get inside! Come on, quickly. Get inside,"
1215,quick. 
1216,(The Doctor fires of more energy from the other hand as Clara gets the
1217,survivors into the Tower. The burning remains of flying Daleks tumble
1218,to the ground.)
1219,
1220,[Bell chamber]
1221,
1222,"DOCTOR: Love from Gallifrey, boys! "
1223,(Then a final blast from his head up to the Dalek Mothership. Mega
1224,KaBOOM! and the shockwave rips open the remaining Daleks on the ground.
1225,It even rocks the
1226,Tardis as it travels out of the town and through the countryside. Then
1227,silence falls.)
1228,
1229,[Town]
1230,
1231,"(Later, Clara leads the people out to survey the"
1232,wreckage.) 
1233,CLARA: Doctor? 
1234,(She sees the Tardis' external emergency telephone hanging off its hook
1235,"and replaces it, then goes inside.)"
1236,
1237,[Tardis]
1238,
1239,(The Doctor's village clothes are scattered on the
1240,"floor, and a nearly empty bowl of fish fingers and custard is on the"
1241,console. There are footsteps on the stairs. Her bow-tied young Doctor
1242,smiles at her.) 
1243,CLARA: Doctor! 
1244,DOCTOR: Hello. 
1245,CLARA: You're young again. You're okay. You didn't even change your
1246,face. 
1247,DOCTOR: Ha! It's started. I can't stop it now. This is just the reset.
1248,A whole new regeneration cycle. Ooo. 
1249,(He finishes his custard.) 
1250,DOCTOR: Taking a bit longer. Just breaking it in. Oh. Oh. Gah. 
1251,(He starts the Tardis' engines.) 
1252,"DOCTOR: It all just disappears, doesn't it? Everything you are, gone in"
1253,"a moment, like breath on a mirror. Any moment now, he's a-coming. "
1254,CLARA: Who's coming? 
1255,DOCTOR: The Doctor. 
1256,"CLARA: But you, you are the Doctor. "
1257,"DOCTOR: Yep, and I always will be. "
1258,(His hands are glowing.) 
1259,"DOCTOR: But times change, and so must I. "
1260,"(The Doctor sees a young Amy Pond run up the stairs, laughing.) "
1261,DOCTOR: Amelia? 
1262,CLARA: Who's Amelia? 
1263,"DOCTOR: The first face this face saw. We all change, when you think"
1264,about it. We're all different people all through our lives. And that's
1265,"okay, that's good, you've got to keep moving, so long as you remember"
1266,all the people that you used to be. I will not forget one line of this.
1267,Not one day. I swear. I will always remember when the Doctor was me. 
1268,(Then he sees a vision of a red-haired woman with black painted
1269,fingernails walk down the stairs to him.) 
1270,AMY: Raggedy man. Good night. 
1271,"(They touch each others cheeks, and she disappears. The Doctor removes"
1272,his bow tie and drops it on the floor. His face is in pain.) 
1273,"CLARA: No, no. "
1274,DOCTOR: Hey 
1275,CLARA: Please don't change. 
1276,(The Doctor jerks backwards as Matt Smith and then forwards as Peter
1277,"Capaldi. Tall, grey haired, piercing blue eyes and a Scottish burr. My"
1278,"kind of man. The new Doctor and Clara stare into each others eyes, then"
1279,he jerks back and forward again.) 
1280,DOCTOR: Kidneys! I've got new kidneys. I don't like the colour. 
1281,CLARA: Of your kidneys? 
1282,(The Tardis starts lurching from side to side.) 
1283,CLARA: What's happening? 
1284,DOCTOR: We're probably crashing. Oh! 
1285,CLARA: Into what? 
1286,DOCTOR: Stay calm. Just one question. Do you happen to know how to fly
1287,this thing?
