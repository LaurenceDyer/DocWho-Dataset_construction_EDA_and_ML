22,(The Tardis materialises in a very tight space.) 
23,DOCTOR: I don't know what's wrong though. She's sort of queasy.
24,"Indigestion, like she didn't"
25,want to land. 
26,"ROSE: Oh, if you think there's going to be trouble, we could always get"
27,back inside and go somewhere else. 
28,(They both laugh.) 
29,DOCTOR: I think we've landed inside a cupboard. Here we go. 
30,[Junction]
31,
32,COMPUTER: Open door 15. 
33,"DOCTOR: Some sort of base. Moon base, sea base, space base. They build"
34,these things out of kits. 
35,COMPUTER: Close door 15. 
36,ROSE: Glad we're indoors. sounds like a storm out there. 
37,COMPUTER: Open door 16. 
38,[Corridor]
39,
40,DOCTOR: Human design. You've got a thing about
41,"kits. This place was put together like a flat pack wardrobe, only"
42,bigger. And easier. 
43,[Habitation 3]
44,
45,(Three steps down into an area with tables and
46,chairs. There is a big 3 on the wall.) 
47,COMPUTER: Open door 17. 
48,"DOCTOR: Oh, it's a sanctuary base. "
49,COMPUTER: Close door 17. 
50,"DOCTOR: Deep Space exploration. We've gone way out. And listen to that,"
51,underneath. Someone's drilling. 
52,ROSE: Welcome to hell. 
53,"DOCTOR: Oh, it's not that bad. "
54,"ROSE: No, over there. "
55,"(The words are painted on the wall in big block letters, and a vertical"
56,alien script underneath.) 
57,"DOCTOR: Hold on, what does that say? That's weird, it won't translate. "
58,"ROSE: But I thought the Tardis translated everything, writing as well."
59,We should see English. 
60,"DOCTOR: Exactly. If that's not working, then it means this writing is"
61,old. Very old. Impossibly old. We should find out who's in charge. 
62,(He starts to spin the wheel on another bulkhead door.) 
63,DOCTOR: We've gone beyond the reach of the Tardis' knowledge. Not a
64,good move. And if someone's lucky enough 
65,COMPUTER: Open door 19. 
66,"(Aliens with tentacles where our noses and mouths are, are standing"
67,"outside the door. They all have a tube going in behind the tentacles,"
68,and carry a white globe in their right hands which they use for
69,"communication, just like the Gaim"
70,in Babylon 5.) 
71,"DOCTOR: Oh! Right. Hello. Sorry. I was just saying, er, nice base. "
72,ALL OOD: We must feed. 
73,DOCTOR: You've got to what? 
74,ALL OOD: We must feed. 
75,ROSE: Yeah. I think they mean us. 
76,(The Ood enter and Rose and the Doctor back away.) 
77,ALL OOD: We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. 
78,(More Ood enter from other doors. The Doctor gets out his sonic
79,screwdriver while Rose picks up a chair.) 
80,ALL OOD: We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We
81,must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We
82,must feed. 
83,OOD: We must feed. 
84,(It taps the globe.) 
85,"OOD: You, if you are hungry. "
86,DOCTOR: Sorry? 
87,OOD: We apologise. Electromagnetics have interfered with speech
88,systems. Would you like some refreshment? 
89,DOCTOR: Er 
90,COMPUTER: Open door 18. 
91,(Humans enter.) 
92,JEFFERSON: What the hell? How did? 
93,(The Ood make way for the newcomers. The lead man uses a wrist-comm.) 
94,"JEFFERSON: Captain, you're not going to believe this. We've got people."
95,"Out of nowhere. I mean, real people. I mean two living people, just"
96,standing here right in front of me. 
97,"ZACH : Don't be stupid, that's impossible. "
98,JEFFERSON: I suggest telling them that. 
99,ROSE: But you're a sort of space base. You must have visitors now and
100,then. It can't be that impossible. 
101,JEFFERSON: You're telling me you don't know where you are? 
102,DOCTOR: No idea. More fun that way. 
103,(A woman's voice makes a broadcast.) 
104,"SCOOTI [on tannoy]: Stand by, everyone. Buckle down. We have incoming."
105,And it's a big one. Quake point five on its way. 
106,(Jefferson opens a door.) 
107,"JEFFERSON: Through here, now. Quickly, come on! Move! "
108,[Corridor]
109,
110,(Conduits go bang overhead.) 
111,JEFFERSON: Move it! Come on! Keep moving. Come on! Quickly! Move it! 
112,[Control room]
113,
114,(Steps down into another room full of people
115,working at control panels.) 
116,"ZACH: Oh, my God. You meant it. "
117,"SCOOTI: People! Look at that, real people! "
118,DOCTOR: That's us. Hooray! 
119,"ROSE: Yeah, definitely real. My name's Rose. Rose Tyler. And, and this"
120,is the Doctor. 
121,DANNY: Come on the oxygen must be offline. We're hallucinating. They
122,"can't be. No, they're real. "
123,"ZACH: Come on, we're in the middle of an alert! Danny, strap up. The"
124,"quake's coming in! Impact in thirty seconds! Sorry you two, whoever you"
125,"are. Just hold on, tight. "
126,ROSE: Hold on to what? 
127,"ZACH: Anything. I don't care. Just hold on. Ood, are we fixed? "
128,OOD: Your kindness in this emergency is much appreciated. 
129,"DOCTOR: What's this planet called, anyway? "
130,"IDA: Now, don't be stupid. It hasn't got a name. How could it have a"
131,"name? You really don't know, do you? "
132,ZACH: And impact! 
133,(The whole place shakes for a few seconds.) 
134,"DOCTOR: Oh, well, that wasn't so bad. "
135,"(And again, much worse. Consoles burst into flames.) "
136,"ZACH: Okay, that's it. Everyone all right? Speak to me, Ida. "
137,"IDA: Yeah, yeah! "
138,ZACH: Danny? 
139,DANNY: Fine. 
140,ZACH: Toby? 
141,"TOBY: Yeah, fine. "
142,ZACH: Scooti? 
143,SCOOTI: No damage. 
144,ZACH: Jefferson? 
145,JEFFERSON: Check! 
146,"DOCTOR: We're fine, thanks, fine. Yeah, don't worry about us. "
147,ZACH: The surface caved in. 
148,(He looks up at a schematic of the base.) 
149,ZACH: I deflected it onto storage five through eight. We've lost them
150,"completely. Toby, go and check the rocket link. "
151,TOBY: That's not my department. 
152,"ZACH: Just do as I say, yeah? "
153,(Toby leaves.) 
154,IDA: Oxygen holding. Internal gravity fifty six point six. We should be
155,okay. 
156,"ROSE: Never mind the earthquake, that's, that's one hell of a storm."
157,"What is that, a hurricane? "
158,SCOOTI: You'd need an atmosphere for a hurricane. There's no air out
159,there. It's a complete vacuum. 
160,ROSE: Then what's shaking the roof? 
161,IDA: You're not joking. You really don't know. Well introductions. F Y
162,"I, as they said in the olden days. I'm Ida Scott, science officer."
163,"Zachary Cross Flane, acting Captain, sir. You've met Mister Jefferson,"
164,"he's Head of Security. Danny Bartock, Ethics committee. "
165,DANNY: Not as boring as it sounds. 
166,"IDA: And that man who just left, that was Toby Zed, Archaeology, and"
167,"this is Scooti Manista, Trainee maintenance. And this? This is home. "
168,(Ida pulls down a lever.) 
169,ZACH: Brace yourselves. The sight of it sends some people mad. 
170,"(The shutters overhead pull back to reveal a white hot, angry, disc"
171,with a black centre and black dots falling into it.) 
172,ROSE: That's a black hole. 
173,DOCTOR: But that's impossible. 
174,ZACH: I did warn you. 
175,DOCTOR: We're standing under a black hole. 
176,IDA: In orbit. 
177,DOCTOR: But we can't be 
178,IDA: You can see for yourself. We're in orbit. 
179,DOCTOR: But we can't be. 
180,IDA: This lump of rock is suspended in perpetual geostationary orbit
181,around that black hole without falling in. Discuss. 
182,"ROSE: And that's bad, yeah? "
183,DOCTOR: Bad doesn't cover it. A black hole's a dead star. It collapses
184,"in on itself, in and in and in until the matter's so dense and tight it"
185,starts to pull everything else in too. Nothing in the universe can
186,"escape it. Light, gravity, time. Everything just gets pulled inside and"
187,crushed. 
188,"ROSE: So, they can't be in orbit. We should be pulled right in. "
189,DOCTOR: We should be dead. 
190,"IDA: And yet here we are, beyond the laws of physics. Welcome on board."
191,
192,"ROSE: But if there's no atmosphere out there, what's that? "
193,IDA: Stars breaking up. Gas clouds. We have whole solar systems being
194,"ripped apart above our heads, before falling into that thing. "
195,"ROSE: So, a bit worse than a storm, then. "
196,IDA: Just a bit. 
197,"ROSE: Just a bit, yeah. "
198,(Another shake.)
199,
200,[Corridor]
201,
202,"(Toby enters a corridor with door 28 at the end,"
203,with scrolls tucked under his arm.) 
204,VOICE : Toby. 
205,(The lights flicker.) 
206,TOBY: Who's that? Danny? 
207,[Control room]
208,
209,COMPUTER: Close door 1. 
210,TOBY: The rocket link's fine. 
211,(Zach calls up a hologram over the central console.) 
212,"ZACH: That's the black hole, officially designated K three seven Gen"
213,five. 
214,"IDA: In the scriptures of the Falltino, this planet is called Kroptor,"
215,the bitter pill. And the black hole is supposed to be a mighty demon.
216,"It was tricked into devouring the planet, only to spit it out, because"
217,it was poison. 
218,ROSE: The bitter pill. I like that. 
219,DOCTOR: We are so far out. Lost in the drifts of the universe. How did
220,you even get here?! 
221,"ZACH: We flew in. You see, this planet's generating a gravity field. We"
222,don't know how. We've no idea. But it's kept in constant balance
223,against the black hole. And the field extends out there as a funnel. A
224,"distinct gravity funnel, reaching out into clear space. That was our"
225,way in. 
226,ROSE: You flew down that thing? Like a rollercoaster. 
227,"ZACH: By rights, the ship should have been torn apart. We lost the"
228,"Captain, which is what put me in charge. "
229,IDA: You're doing a good job. 
230,"ZACH: Yeah, well, needs must. "
231,"DANNY: But if that gravity funnel closes, there's no way out. "
232,SCOOTI: We had fun speculating about that. 
233,"DANNY: Oh, yeah. That's the word. Fun. "
234,DOCTOR: But that field would take phenomenal amounts of power. I mean
235,"not just big, but off the scale! Can I? "
236,IDA: Sure. Help yourself. 
237,(An Ood gives Rose a plastic cup of drink.) 
238,OOD: Your refreshment. 
239,"ROSE: Oh, yeah. Thanks. Thank you. I'm sorry, what was your name? "
240,OOD: We have no titles. We are as one. 
241,"ROSE: Er, what are they called? "
242,"DANNY: Oh, come on. Where have you been living? Everyone's got one. "
243,"ROSE: Well, not me, so, what are they? "
244,DANNY: They're the Ood. 
245,ROSE: The Ood? 
246,DANNY: The Ood. 
247,ROSE: Well that's ood. 
248,"DANNY: Very ood, but handy. They work the mine shafts. All the drilling"
249,and stuff. Supervision and maintenance. They're born for it. Basic
250,slave race. 
251,ROSE: You've got slaves? 
252,SCOOTI: Don't start. She's like one of that lot. Friends of the Ood. 
253,"ROSE: Well maybe I am, yeah. Since when do humans need slaves? "
254,"DANNY: But the Ood offer themselves. If you don't give them orders,"
255,they just pine away and die. 
256,"ROSE: Seriously, you like being ordered about? "
257,OOD: It is all we crave. 
258,"ROSE: Why's that, then? "
259,OOD: We have nothing else in life. 
260,"ROSE: Yeah, well, I used to think like that, a long time ago. "
261,"DOCTOR: There we go. Do you see? To generate that gravity field, and"
262,"the funnel, you'd need a power source with an inverted self"
263,extrapolating reflex of six to the power of six every six seconds. 
264,ROSE: That's a lot of sixes. 
265,DOCTOR: And it's impossible. 
266,ZACH: It took us two years to work that out 
267,DOCTOR: I'm very good. 
268,IDA: But that's why we're here. This power source is ten miles below
269,through solid rock. Point Zero. We're drilling down to try and find it.
270,
271,ZACH: It's giving off readings of over ninety stats on the Blazon
272,scale. 
273,IDA: It could revolutionise modern science. 
274,JEFFERSON: We could use it to fuel the Empire. 
275,DOCTOR: Or start a war. 
276,"TOBY: It's buried beneath us, in the darkness, waiting. "
277,"ROSE: What's your job, chief dramatist? "
278,"TOBY: Well, whatever it is down there is not a natural phenomena. And"
279,"this, er, planet once supported life eons ago, before the human race"
280,had even learned to walk. 
281,DOCTOR: I saw that lettering written on the wall. Did you do that? 
282,"TOBY: I copied it from fragments we found unearthed by the drilling,"
283,but I can't translate it. 
284,"DOCTOR: No, neither can I. And that's saying something. "
285,TOBY: There was some form of civilisation. They buried something. Now
286,"it's reaching out, calling us in. "
287,DOCTOR: And you came. 
288,"IDA: Well, how could we not? "
289,"DOCTOR: So, when it comes right down to it, why did you come here? Why"
290,did you do that? Why? I'll tell you why. Because it was there.
291,"Brilliant. Excuse me, er, Zach, wasn't it? "
292,ZACH: That's me. 
293,"DOCTOR: Just stand there, because I'm going to hug you. Is that all"
294,right? 
295,ZACH: I suppose so. 
296,"DOCTOR: Here we go. Come on, then. "
297,(The Doctor hugs Zach.) 
298,"DOCTOR: Oh, human beings. You are amazing! Ha! Thank you. "
299,ZACH: Not at all. 
300,"DOCTOR: But apart from that, you're completely mad. You should pack"
301,"your bags, get back in that ship and fly for your lives. "
302,IDA: You can talk. And how the hell did you get here? 
303,"DOCTOR: Oh, I've got this er, this ship. It's hard to explain. It just"
304,sort of appears. 
305,"ROSE: We can show you, we parked down the corridor from er. Oh, what's"
306,it called? Habitation area 
307,DOCTOR: Three. 
308,ROSE: Three. Three. 
309,ZACH: Do you mean storage six? 
310,"DOCTOR: It was a bit of a cupboard, yeah. Storage six. But you said."
311,You said. You said storage five to eight. 
312,(The Doctor runs out.) 
313,[Corridor]
314,
315,ROSE: What is it? What's wrong? 
316,[Habitation 3] 
317,COMPUTER: Open door 19. Close door 19. 
318,DOCTOR: Open the door! Come on! 
319,COMPUTER: Open door 17. 
320,[Corridor]
321,
322,COMPUTER: Open door 15. Door 16 out of commission. 
323,DOCTOR: It can't be. It can't be! 
324,"ROSE: What's wrong? What is it? Doctor, the Tardis is in there. What's"
325,happened? 
326,DOCTOR: The Tardis is gone. 
327,COMPUTER: Door 16 out of commission. 
328,DOCTOR: The earthquake. This section collapsed. 
329,ROSE: But it's got to be out there somewhere. 
330,(Rose looks through the porthole in the bulkhead door.) 
331,DOCTOR: Look down. 
332,[Control room]
333,
334,DOCTOR: The ground gave way. My Tardis must've
335,fallen down right into the heart of the planet. But you've got robot
336,drills heading the same way. 
337,ZACH: We can't divert the drilling. 
338,DOCTOR: But I need my ship. It's all I've got. Literally the only
339,thing. 
340,"ZACH: Doctor, we've only got the resources to drill one central shaft"
341,"down to the power source, and that's it. No diversions, no"
342,"distractions, no exceptions. Your machine is lost. All I can do is"
343,"offer you a lift if we ever get to leave this place, and that is the"
344,end of it. 
345,"IDA: I'll er, put you on the duty roster. We need someone in the"
346,laundry. 
347,"(The Doctor and Rose are left alone, except for an Ood.) "
348,COMPUTER: Open door 1. Close door 1. 
349,DOCTOR: I've trapped you here. 
350,"ROSE: No, don't worry about me. "
351,(Shaking.) 
352,"ROSE: Okay, we're on a planet that shouldn't exist, under a black hole"
353,"and no way out. Yeah, I've changed my mind. Start worrying about me."
354,
355,[Outside the base]
356,
357,COMPUTER: Entering night shift. Your chosen track
358,for transition is Ravel's Bolero. 
359,(Jefferson wanders among the Ood as they work. Scooti is at work on the
360,planet's surface.) 
361,SCOOTI: All finished. Coming back inside. 
362,[Corridor]
363,
364,(Danny checks off the Ood as they walk past him.) 
365,DANNY: Ood 7 Gamma 10. Ood 7 Gamma 11. Ood 7 Gamma 12.
366,
367,[Toby's quarters]
368,
369,(Toby is examining a fragment of a scrolls beneath
370,a magnifying glass. The music stops unexpectedly.) 
371,VOICE : Toby. I can see you 
372,"TOBY: Danny, is that you? It's, it's not funny, all right? Dan? "
373,[Corridor]
374,
375,(Toby steps out of his quarters into the corridor
376,which ends with doors 38 and 40. It is empty.) 
377,"TOBY: I'm. I'm trying to work, Daniel. Look, if, if that's you, then"
378,can you just stop it ? 
379,(The lights flicker. Toby takes another look around then goes back
380,inside.)
381,
382,[Habitation 3]
383,
384,(The Doctor is examining the alien script.) 
385,"ZACH : Danny, check the temperature in Ood Habitation. It seems to"
386,be rising. 
387,(Rose goes to get something to eat.) 
388,SCOOTI: Help yourself. Just don't have the green. Or the blue. 
389,(Rose takes her tray to the serving window.) 
390,"ROSE: Er, bit of that, thanks. "
391,(It's the blue.) 
392,OOD: Would you like sauce with that? 
393,"ROSE: I'll have a go, yeah. I did that job once. I was a, a dinner"
394,"lady. Not that I'm calling you a lady. Although, I"
395,"don't know, you might be. Do you actually get paid, though? Do they"
396,give you money? 
397,OOD: The Beast and his Armies shall rise from the Pit to make war
398,against God. 
399,ROSE: I'm sorry? 
400,"OOD: Apologies. I said, I hope you enjoy your meal. "
401,ROSE: Yeah.

406,head speed increasing. 
407,ZACH: Keep pressure at sixty. 
408,"(He turns away from the console, and the hologram in the middle briefly"
409,"turns into an image of a roaring horned beast. When he looks back, it"
410,disappears.)

413,
414,COMPUTER: Close door 3. 
415,DANNY: I've closed door 3. 
416,COMPUTER: He is awake. 
417,DANNY: What did you say? 
418,COMPUTER: Close door 3.
419,
420,[Toby's quarters]
421,
422,VOICE : Toby. Don't turn around. 
423,TOBY: Dan? That's not Dan. 
424,VOICE : Don't look at me. 
425,TOBY: Who are you? 
426,VOICE : I have so many names. 
427,TOBY: If if I could 
428,"VOICE : If you look at me, you will die. "
429,TOBY: But who are you? 
430,"VOICE : I'm behind you, Toby. I'm right behind you. Don't look."
431,"Don't look at me. One look and you will die. I'm reaching out, Toby."
432,"I'm so close. Don't turn around. Oh, I can touch you. "
433,(Toby turns. There is no one there. He puts down the pieces of pot he
434,was looking at and rips of his latex gloves. The alien symbols are on
435,"the palms of his hands. He picks up a mirror and they are on his face,"
436,too. He falls to the floor.)
437,
438,[Habitation 3]
439,
440,(The lights flicker.)
441,IDA: Zach? Have we got a problem? 
442,ZACH : No more than usual. Got the Scarlet System burning up. Might
443,be worth a look. 
444,IDA: You might want to see this. Moment in history. 
445,(She opens the shutters.) 
446,IDA: There. On the edge. That red cloud. That used to be the Scarlet
447,"System. Home to the Peluchi, a mighty civilisation spanning a billion"
448,"years, disappearing forever. Their planets and suns consumed. Ladies"
449,"and gentlemen, we have witnessed its passing. "
450,"DOCTOR: Er, no, could you leave it open? Just for a bit. I won't go"
451,"mad, I promise. "
452,"IDA: How would you know? Scooti, check the lockdown. Jefferson, sign"
453,off the airlock seals for me. 
454,(Jefferson and Scooti leave by door 17 or 19. Ida uses door 18.) 
455,COMPUTER: Open door 18. 
456,"ROSE: I've seen films and things, yeah. They say black holes are like"
457,gateways to another universe. 
458,COMPUTER: Close door 18. 
459,DOCTOR: Not that one. It just eats. 
460,ROSE: Long way from home. 
461,"DOCTOR: Go that way, turn right, keep going for er, about, er, five"
462,"hundred years, and you'll reach the Earth. "
463,(Rose turns her phone on.)
