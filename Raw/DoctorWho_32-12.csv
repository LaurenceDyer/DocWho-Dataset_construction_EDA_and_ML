21, (Evening. The Sanderson & Grainger
22,department store sign and the street lights are flickering in the
23,pedestrian area outside. The last customers are leaving.) 
24,WOMAN: Thank you. 
25,KELLY: Better cash up then. Suppose John Joe can just wait for me. 
26,"SHONA: No, I'll do it. You head off. "
27,(The lights flicker again.) 
28,KELLY: When's the council going to fix this? Last night my telly went
29,off in the middle of Top Model. 
30,"SHONA: John Joe's waiting. I'll do the changing rooms, too. "
31,"KELLY: Oh, thanks, Shona."
32,
33,[Craig's home]
34,
35,SOPHIE: There's a list on the fridge. 
36,CRAIG: I saw it. 
37,SOPHIE: And I've labelled the food and sort of numbered it. 
38,"CRAIG: Sophie, you don't need to number food. "
39,"SOPHIE: It's just a suggestion. Also, my mum might phone. "
40,CRAIG: Might? 
41,"SOPHIE: And your Mum, and my Dad, and you know, just some people. "
42,"CRAIG: I can cope on my own. Now, please go and have a rest. You need"
43,it. I love you. 
44,"SOPHIE: I love you, too. And thank you for this. And I do know you can"
45,cope on your own. And I may have drawn some arrows in the fridge. 
46,CRAIG: You really have to go now.
47,
48,[Changing rooms]
49,
50,(There are garments and accessories scattered
51,everywhere.) 
52,"SHONA: Oh, Kelly. "
53,(One of the cubicle curtains moves in the flickering light.) 
54,"SHONA: Hello? Sorry, we need to close up. Two minutes, okay?"
55,
56,[Living room]
57,
58,"CRAIG: Mum, it's not just you. I'm phoning"
59,everybody. I'm texting the world. Craig Owens can do it on his own. No
60,one is coming to help me. 
61,(A knock at the door.) 
62,"CRAIG: Mum, I'm going to have to call you back. I'm coping. I'm coping"
63,on my own. I'm coping on my own!
64,
65,[Front door]
66,
67,CRAIG: I'm coping on my own! 
68,"DOCTOR: Hello, Craig. I'm back. "
69,CRAIG: She didn't. How could she phone you? 
70,"DOCTOR: How could who phone me? Nobody phoned me, I'm just here. Oh,"
71,you've redecorated. I don't like it. 
72,CRAIG: It's a different house. We moved. 
73,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's it. "
74,"CRAIG: Doctor, what are you doing here? "
75,DOCTOR: Social call. Thought it was about time I tried one out. How are
76,you? 
77,CRAIG: I'm fine. 
78,"DOCTOR: This is the bit where I say I'm fine too, isn't it? I'm fine,"
79,too. Good. Love to Sophie. Bye. 
80,"(The Doctor turns to leave, then the lights flicker.) "
81,DOCTOR: Something's wrong. 
82,(He runs inside and heads upstairs with the sonic screwdriver.)
83,
84,[Staircase]
85,
86,"DOCTOR: On your own, you said. But you're not."
87,You're not on your own. 
88,CRAIG: Just shush. 
89,DOCTOR: Increased sulphur emissions. And look at the state of this
90,place. What are you not telling me? 
91,"CRAIG: Doctor, please. "
92,DOCTOR: Shush. 
93,"CRAIG: No, you shush. "
94,DOCTOR: Shush! 
95,CRAIG: Shush! 
96,"DOCTOR: No, you shush! "
97,CRAIG: Doctor!

99,[Changing rooms]
100,
101,"SHONA: Hello, who's in there? "
102,[Alfie's bedroom]
103,
104,(The Doctor bursts in.) 
105,"DOCTOR: Whatever you are, get off this planet. "
106,ALFIE: Whaaaa!! 
107,CRAIG: You've woken him!
108,
109,[Changing rooms]
110,
111,SHONA: Hello? Are you all right? 
112,(She pulls back the curtain to reveal - a Cyberman!)
113,
114,[Kitchen]
115,
116,DOCTOR: So when you say on your own 
117,"CRAIG: Yes, I meant on my own with the baby. Yes. Because no one thinks"
118,"I can cope on my own. Which is so unfair, because I can't cope on my"
119,"own with him. I can't. He just cries all the time. I mean, do they have"
120,off switches? 
121,"DOCTOR: Human beings. No. Believe me, I've checked. "
122,"CRAIG: No, babies. "
123,DOCTOR: Same difference. Sometimes this works though. Shush. 
124,(Alfie goes quiet.) 
125,CRAIG: Can you teach me to do that? 
126,DOCTOR: Probably not. 
127,"CRAIG: Oh, please. Come on, I need something. I'm rubbish at this. "
128,DOCTOR: At what? 
129,"CRAIG: Being a dad. You read all the books, and they tell you you'll"
130,know what to do if you follow your instincts. I have no instinct.
131,"That's what this weekend's about, trying to prove to people I can do"
132,this one thing well. 
133,(The Doctor is flicking through the books on the table. He laughs at
134,Daisy's Wild Ride.) 
135,"DOCTOR: So, what did you call him? Will I blush? "
136,"CRAIG: No, we didn't call him the Doctor. "
137,"DOCTOR: No, I didn't think you would. "
138,CRAIG: He's called Alfie. What are you doing here anyway? 
139,"DOCTOR: Yes, he likes that, Alfie, though personally he prefers to be"
140,"called Stormageddon, Dark Lord Of All. "
141,"CRAIG: Sorry, what? "
142,DOCTOR: That's what he calls himself. 
143,CRAIG: And how do you know that? 
144,DOCTOR: I speak baby. 
145,CRAIG: Of course you do. I don't even know when his nappy needs
146,"changing, and I'm the one supposed to be his dad. Oh. "
147,DOCTOR: Yeah. He's wondering where his mum is? Where is Sophie? 
148,CRAIG: She's gone away with Melina for the weekend. She needs a rest. 
149,"DOCTOR: No, he's your dad. You can't just call him Not Mum. "
150,CRAIG: Not Mum? 
151,"DOCTOR: That's you. Also Not Mum, that's me. And everybody else is"
152,peasants. That's a bit unfortunate. 
153,CRAIG: What are you here for? What's happening? 
154,DOCTOR: I just popped in to say hello. 
155,"CRAIG: You don't do that. I checked upstairs when we moved, it's real."
156,"And next door, both sides, they're humans. Is it the fridge? Are there"
157,aliens in my fridge? 
158,"DOCTOR: I just want to see you, Craig! Cross my hearts. I've been"
159,knocking about on my own for a bit. Bit of a farewell tour. One last
160,"thing, popping in to see you, then I'm off to the Alignment of Exedor. "
161,CRAIG: The Alignment of Exedor? 
162,DOCTOR: Seventeen galaxies in perfect unison. Meant to be spectacular.
163,I can't miss it. Literally can't. It's locked in a time stasis field. I
164,"get one crack at flying my Tardis straight into it, if I get my dates"
165,right. Which I have. 
166,CRAIG: Sounds nice. 
167,(The Doctor looks through the local paper.) 
168,"DOCTOR: So this is me, popping in and popping out again. Just being"
169,social. Just having a laugh. Never mind that. 
170,CRAIG: Never mind what? 
171,DOCTOR: Nothing. 
172,"CRAIG: No, you've noticed something. You've got your noticing face on."
173,I have nightmares about that face. 
174,"DOCTOR: Ooo, nope, given up all that. Done noticing things. I didn't"
175,"even notice that, for example. Well, got to go. Good seeing you, Craig."
176,"Goodbye, Stormageddon. "
177,"CRAIG: No, no, wait, wait. Can you do the shushing thing? "
178,"DOCTOR: No, it only works once, and only on life forms with"
179,underdeveloped brains. 
180,"CRAIG: Hang on. You said farewell tour. What do you mean, farewell? "
181,DOCTOR: Shush.
182,
183,[Outside Craig's home]
184,
185,DOCTOR; Just go. Stop noticing. Just go. Stop
186,"noticing, just go. Stop noticing, just go. Stop it. Am I noticing? No."
187,"No, I am not. And what I am not doing is scanning for electrical"
188,"fluctuations. Oh, shut up, you. I'm just dropping in on a friend. The"
189,last thing I need right now is a patina of teleport energy. I'm going.
190,"Do you hear me? Going. Not staying, going. I am through saving them. I"
191,am going away now.
192,
193,[Toy department]
194,
195,(The Doctor is demonstrating a remote control
196,helicopter to a group of children.) 
197,"DOCTOR: It goes up tiddly up, it goes down tiddly down for only forty"
198,"nine ninety nine, which I personally think is a bit steep, but then"
199,again it's your parents' cash and they'll only waste it on boring stuff
200,like lamps and vegetables. Yawn! 
201,"CRAIG: Yeah, Soph. Just enjoy your holiday. Yeah, coping. "
202,"DOCTOR: Nobody panic, but I appear to be losing control. "
203,(The helicopter crashes near Craig.) 
204,"CRAIG: Yeah, love you. "
205,"DOCTOR: Oops. Guys, guys, ladies and gentlemen. While I deal with this"
206,"awkward moment, you go and find your parents slash guardians. Try in"
207,lamps. Craig! 
208,CRAIG: What the hell are you doing here? 
209,"DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. I work in a shop now. Here to help. Look, they"
210,gave me a badge with my name on in case I forget who I am. Very
211,"thoughtful, as that does happen. "
212,"CRAIG: You were leaving. The Alignment of Exeter, what about that? One"
213,"chance to see it, you said. "
214,"DOCTOR: Well, I was on my way, you know. Saw a shop, got a job. You got"
215,"to live in the moment. Craig, mind Yappy. "
216,CRAIG: What? 
217,DOCTOR: Yappy. The robot dog. Not so much fun as I remember. You look
218,awful. 
219,"CRAIG: I haven't slept, have I? I still can't stop him crying. I even"
220,tried singing to him last night. 
221,"DOCTOR: Yeah, he did mention that he thought you were crying, too. He"
222,"didn't get a wink. Yappy, say goodbye to Craig and Stormageddon."
223,"Goodbye, Craig. Goodbye, Stormageddon. "
224,"(As the Doctor puts down the little robot dog, something whizzes past"
225,the end of the aisle.) 
226,DOCTOR: What was that? 
227,"CRAIG: You're here for a reason, aren't you? You noticed something, and"
228,"you're investigating it. And because it's you, it's going to be"
229,dangerous and alien. 
230,DOCTOR: Might not be. 
231,"CRAIG: Doctor, I live here. I need to know. "
232,"DOCTOR: No, you don't. "
233,CRAIG: My baby lives here. My son. 
234,DOCTOR: Sheila Clark went missing Tuesday. Atif Ghosh last seen Friday.
235,Tom Luker last seen Sunday. 
236,CRAIG: Why's none of this on the front page? 
237,"DOCTOR: Oh, page one has an exclusive on Nina, a local girl who got"
238,"kicked off Britain's Got Talent. These people are on pages seven,"
239,"nineteen, twenty two. Because no one's noticed yet. They're far too"
240,"excited about Nina's emotional journey, which in fairness, is quite"
241,inspiring. 
242,CRAIG: And what else? 
243,(The Doctor wheels Alfie's buggy out into -)
244,
245,[Children's clothing]
246,
247,DOCTOR: These funny old power fluctuations which
248,just happen to coincide with the disappearances. 
249,"CRAIG: That's just the council putting in new cables, isn't it? "
250,(He stops at an Out Of Order lift.) 
251,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, that's it. Mystery solved. Wasting my time. Now, you"
252,can go home and I can go to Exedor. Goodbye. 
253,(He uses his sonic screwdriver.) 
254,DOCTOR: And here's the lift. 
255,CRAIG: It says it's out of order. 
256,DOCTOR: Not any more. See? Here to help. 
257,CRAIG: It says danger. 
258,"DOCTOR: Oh, rubbish. Lifts aren't dangerous. "
259,CRAIG: Do I look like I'm stupid? 
260,(Alfie makes a comment in Baby. The Doctor laughs.) 
261,"DOCTOR: Quiet, Stormy. Oh, all right. There's more. "
262,[Lift]
263,
264,"DOCTOR: Just between you, me and Stormy, don't want"
265,to frighten me punters. Someone's been using a teleport relay right
266,here in this shop. Missing people last seen in this area. Before you
267,"ask, CCTV's been wiped. "
268,"CRAIG: A teleport? A teleport? A teleport like, a beam me up teleport,"
269,like you see in Star Trek? 
270,DOCTOR: Exactly. Someone's been using a beam me up Star Trek teleport.
271,Could be disguised as anything. 
272,(There are six circles in a circle on the ceiling.) 
273,CRAIG: But a teleport in a shop? That's ridiculous. 
274,[Cybership]
275,
276,CRAIG: What was that? Was that the lights again? 
277,"DOCTOR: (strangled) Yes, that's it. That's all. It's the lights. "
278,CRAIG: Why did you say that like that? 
279,DOCTOR: Like what? 
280,"CRAIG: Like that, in that high pitched voice. "
281,"DOCTOR: Just keep looking at me, Craig. Right at me. Just keep looking."
282,
283,CRAIG: Why? 
284,"DOCTOR: Well, because, because, because I love you. "
285,CRAIG: You love me? 
286,"DOCTOR: Yes, Craig. It's you. It's always been you. "
287,CRAIG: Me? 
288,DOCTOR: Is that so surprising? 
289,(The Doctor puts his arms around Craig's neck and uses the sonic
290,screwdriver on whatever it is behind the definitely-not-a-lift-anymore
291,scene behind him.) 
292,"CRAIG: Doctor, are you going to kiss me? "
293,"DOCTOR: Yes, Craig. Yes, I am. Would you like that? Bit out of"
294,"practice, but I've had some wonderful feedback. "
295,"CRAIG: Doctor, no. I can't. I'm taken. "
296,(Craig looks behind him.) 
297,"CRAIG: Oh, my God! "
298,DOCTOR: Or we could just hold hands if it make you'd feel more
299,comfortable. 
300,(A Cyberman notices them.) 
301,CRAIG: What is happening? 
302,"DOCTOR: Well, first of all, I don't really love you, except as a"
303,friend. 
304,CRAIG: What is that?
305,
306,[Lift]
307,
308,DOCTOR: Quick reverse. 
309,CRAIG: What the hell just happened?
310,
311,[Children's clothing]
312,
313,DOCTOR: They must have linked the teleport relay to
314,"the lift, but I've fused it. They can't use that again. Stuck up there"
315,on their spaceship.
316,
317,[Soft furnishings]
318,
319,CRAIG: What were those things? 
320,DOCTOR: Cybermen. 
321,CRAIG: Ship. A spaceship. We were in space?
322,
323,[Pedestrian precinct]
324,
325,(After sunset.) 
326,DOCTOR: It's got to be up there somewhere. Can't get a fix. It must be
327,shielded. 
328,CRAIG: But you fused the teleport. You sorted it. They can't come back.
329,
330,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, I've just bought myself a little time. Still got to"
331,work out what they're doing before I can stop it. 
332,"CRAIG: But if they've got the teleport and they're that evil, why"
333,haven't they invaded already? 
334,"DOCTOR: Craig, take Alfie and go. "
335,CRAIG: No. 
336,DOCTOR: No? 
337,"CRAIG: No. I remember from last time, people got killed. People that"
338,"didn't know you. I know where it's safest for me and Alfie, and that's"
339,right next to you. 
340,DOCTOR: Is that so? 
341,CRAIG: Yeah. You always win. You always survive. 
342,DOCTOR: Those were the days. 
343,CRAIG: I can help you. I'm staying. 
344,"DOCTOR: Craig. Craig. All right. All right, maybe those days aren't"
345,"quite over yet. Let's go and investigate. I mean, there's no immediate"
346,danger now. 
347,[Jewellry section]
348,
349,"DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Val. "
350,VAL: Hello. 
351,CRAIG: Where am I investigating? 
352,"DOCTOR: Well, look round. Ask questions. People like it when you're"
353,with a baby. Babies are sweet. People talk to you. That's why I usually
354,take a human with me. 
355,"CRAIG: So, I'm your baby? "
356,DOCTOR: You're my baby. 
357,(The Doctor hugs Craig. Val smiles indulgently.) 
358,"VAL: Hope you don't mind me saying, Doctor, but I think you look ever"
359,"so sweet, you and your partner and the baby. "
360,"DOCTOR: Partner. Yes, I like it. Is it better than companion? "
361,VAL: Companion sounds old-fashioned. There's no need to be coy these
362,days. 
363,"DOCTOR: You've not noticed anything unusual around here lately, Val? "
364,VAL: Well 
365,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes? "
366,VAL: Mary Warnock saw Don Petheridge snogging Andrea Groom outside the
367,Conservative Club on his so-called day off golfing. 
368,DOCTOR: Yeah. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all. 
369,(The Doctor air-kisses Val and moves away.) 
370,VAL: And then there's that silver rat thing. 
371,DOCTOR: What?
372,
373,[Ladies underwear]
374,
375,(The thing that has just scuttled past.) 
376,"CRAIG: All right, Alfie, you watch Daddy investigate. You look cute,"
377,I'll do the talking. 
378,(He finds Kelly by a rack of bras.) 
379,"KELLY: Good afternoon, sir. Can I help you? "
380,CRAIG: Hiya. I'm Craig. 
381,KELLY: Yeah? 
382,CRAIG: Do you mind if I just ask you some questions. 
383,KELLY: You what? 
384,"CRAIG: Just between me and you, in confidence, have you noticed"
385,anything unusual? Interesting? 
386,KELLY: You what? 
387,CRAIG: Talk to me about ladies wear. 
388,KELLY: George! 
389,(Enter the well built security guard.) 
390,"CRAIG: Hi, George. Nice uniform."
391,
392,[Toy department]
393,
394,"(The Doctor is underneath a table, scanning.) "
395,"DOCTOR: A silver rat, glowing red eyes. "
396,"VAL: Yes. Then it zizzed off. I wanted to get one for my nephew, but"
397,stockroom say there's no such item. 
398,DOCTOR: I bet they do. 
399,"VAL: Well, what was it then? Answer me that."
400,
401,[Ladies underwear]
402,
403,"GEORGE: Can I help you, sir? "
404,CRAIG: Have you seen how cute my baby is? Look at his face. I'm going
405,"to head off, actually. All right, whoa. "
406,[Toy department]
407,
408,CRAIG : Whoa! 
409,VAL: What's all that hullabaloo? 
410,"DOCTOR: Er, that'll be my partner with the er "
411,VAL: Ah.
412,
413,[Ladies underwear]
414,
415,(Craig has knocked over a rack of frillies.) 
416,"GEORGE: Make a habit of hanging round in women's wear, sir? "
417,"CRAIG: I'm sorry. Oh, shush. Alfie, come on. "
418,KELLY: He's a pervert. Look at him. 
419,"DOCTOR: Hello, everyone. Here to help. "
420,"KELLY: Hello, Doctor. "
421,"GEORGE: Hello, Doctor. "
422,DOCTOR: Hello. Has anyone seen a silver rat? No. Okay. Long shot. I see
423,"you've met my friend, Craig. Nice uniform, George. "
424,"GEORGE: Thank you, Doctor. If he's with you, that's all right, then. "
425,"KELLY: Sorry. I thought he was hassling me, because that's the last"
426,"thing I need today, because Shona's not turned up, right, so I'm doing"
427,"twice the work for the same money, if you don't mind. "
428,DOCTOR: Shush. 
429,CRAIG: Please teach me how to do that. 
430,DOCTOR: No. Hold on. Un-shush. Shona? 
431,KELLY: My supervisor. She's meant to be in today but never showed up. 
432,"DOCTOR: Well, where did you last see her?"
433,
434,[Changing rooms]
435,
436,"CRAIG: How do you do that? It's a power, isn't it."
437,Some sort of weird alien hypnotic power. I bet you excrete some sort of
438,gas that makes people love you. 
439,"DOCTOR: Would that I could, Craig. "
440,(The Doctor looks through a curtain and a woman screams.) 
441,"DOCTOR: Er, sorry, Madam. I'd try that in red if I were you. "
442,"CRAIG: I'm right though, aren't I? "
443,"DOCTOR: Well, you love me, I've never excreted any weird alien gases at"
444,you. 
445,CRAIG: I don't love you. Don't start that again. 
446,(Alfie gurgles.) 
447,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know. Course he does. Of course you do. We're partners. "
448,"CRAIG: Yeah, but I did exactly what you would have done, and I nearly"
449,got arrested. 
450,DOCTOR: Stormy thinks you should believe in yourself more. 
451,CRAIG: Great. So now my baby's reviewing me. 
452,DOCTOR: Here. Right here. Last night. A Cyberman took Shona. 
453,CRAIG: A Cyberman? I thought it was a little silver rat. 
454,DOCTOR: It's not a rat. It's a Cybermat. 
455,CRAIG: All right. Don't have a go at me just because I don't know the
456,names.
457,
458,[Ladies clothing]
459,
460,"DOCTOR: Cybermats are infiltrators. Very small,"
461,very deadly. They collect power like bees collect pollen. One of them's
462,been sucking the electrical energy from this area. But why a shop? You
463,"know, why not a nuclear power station? "
464,"CRAIG: Okay, why? "
465,DOCTOR: Let's ask it. We wait for the shop to shut. We stake the place
466,out and grab ourselves a Cybermat. 
467,"CRAIG: And this is just a coincidence, is it? "
468,DOCTOR: What is? 
469,"CRAIG: Aliens in Colchester. Aliens twice in my life, happening to me,"
470,just when you turn up. 
471,"DOCTOR: Whoa, whoa, whoa. This is not my fault, Craig. "
472,"CRAIG: Oh, shush. Look what you've done now. "
473,DOCTOR: It's his nappy. He's mentioned it twice. 
474,"CRAIG: Well sorry, I don't speak baby, do I. "
475,DOCTOR: There's a changing station over by Electrical Goods. 
476,"CRAIG: And of course, you'd know that. Come on, Alfie. "
477,DOCTOR: Craig! It's a coincidence. It happens. It's what the universe
478,does for 
479,(The Doctor sees Amy and Rory walking towards him when a little girl
480,stops them.) 
481,"ELLY: Can I have your autograph, please? "
482,"AMY: Er, yeah. Sure. "
483,DOCTOR: Fun. 
484,AMY: What's your name? 
485,ELLY: Elly. 
486,AMY: To Elly. I like your hairband. 
487,ELLY: Thank you.

489,RORY: All right? 
490,AMY: There you go. 
491,ELLY: Thank you.

502,"DOCTOR: Right, let's be having you then, Cybermat. "
503,(Alfie cries.) 
504,DOCTOR: Shush. 
505,CRAIG: Can't you put that on quiet? 
506,DOCTOR: No. It's a sonic screwdriver. Sonic equals sound. Take this. I
507,"got it on my discount, ten percent off. It's a papoose. "
508,CRAIG: Why do I need a papoose? 
509,DOCTOR: Alfie wants you attached to him. You are far too slow when he
510,summons you. 
511,CRAIG: When's he going to stop giving me marks? 
512,DOCTOR: Never. That's parenthood. Couldn't you have just got a
513,"babysitter? No, any babysitter. Doesn't have to be a hot one. "
514,CRAIG: I told everyone I know I didn't need their help this weekend. 
515,DOCTOR: Well. 
516,CRAIG: They won't even answer my calls. I didn't know there was going
517,to be an invasion of Cyberman. 
518,DOCTOR: Shush. 
519,"(Down in the basement, the lights are playing up.) "
520,DOCTOR: It's okay. 
521,(They get Alfie out of the buggy to go into the papoose when the
522,Cybermat shows itself. The Doctor snares it in a butterfly net.) 
523,DOCTOR: Ah ha! That's very odd. It must be on low power. Or I'm better
524,at that than I remember. 
525,"CRAIG: Oh, is that it? "
526,DOCTOR: Yeah. 
527,"CRAIG: Oh, that's quite cute. Look at that. Look, Alfie, look. "

547,"DOCTOR: Oh, I've been, I've been chipped, chapped, chopped. The"
548,"Cyberman. It killed George, took him back to the ship. "
549,CRAIG: The Cybermen are here? But you said 
550,"DOCTOR: Yeah, I know what I said. I say a lot of things. But I fused"
551,the teleport. It should have taken them days to repair. 
552,CRAIG: Are you okay? 
553,"DOCTOR: Oh, I should be dead, but the arm it chopped me with, it was"
554,damaged. Old spare parts. Must have changed those missing people. 
555,CRAIG: They've changed the missing into Cybermen? Why didn't they
556,change you? 
557,DOCTOR: A long story. I'm not exactly compatible. But why are they
558,using spare parts? Why? Everything I find out makes less sense. 
559,"CRAIG: Doctor, listen to me. If the Cybermen are here, then we're not"
560,safe. We've got to go. We've got to go back to base.

584,"right now, everything's ahead of you. You could be anything. Yes, I"
585,know. You could walk among the stars. They don't actually look like
586,"that, you know. They are rather more impressive. "
587,(The Doctor sonicks up a holographic starscape.) 
588,"DOCTOR: Yeah. You know, when I was little like you, I dreamt of the"
589,"stars. I think it's fair to say in the language of your age, that I"
590,"lived my dream, I owned the stage, gave it a hundred and ten percent. I"
591,"hope you have as much fun as I did, Alfie. "

668,"need power? Why are those conversions not complete yet, and what are"
669,they doing up there? 
670,CRAIG: You said you were going to look at its brain.

673,CRAIG: The Cybermat came after us?
