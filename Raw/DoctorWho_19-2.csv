20, [Tardis] 
21, (A massive modular spaceship is travelling between
22,the stars when the Tardis materialises inside it.) 
23,"ADRIC: Oh, we've stopped. We're there, Nyssa. Get the Doctor, will you?"
24,
25,NYSSA: Yes. 
26,(The Doctor enters with Tegan.) 
27,ADRIC: We've arrived. 
28,DOCTOR: Oh. A bit ahead of schedule. When was your flight again? 
29,"TEGAN: A778, seventeen thirty hours. "
30,"DOCTOR: February the twenty eighth, 1981. Oh, you'll have time for a"
31,cup of tea. It's only sixteen fifteen hours. 
32,(But the scanner shows a spaceship compartment with strange technical
33,equipment in it.) 
34,TEGAN: Doesn't look much like Heathrow to me. 
35,"DOCTOR: Last time I was there, they were doing strange things to"
36,"Terminal three. Oh. No, you're right. It doesn't. "
37,"ADRIC: Well, don't look at me. I set the coordinates as you instructed."
38,Six three zero niner in the inner spiral arm of Galaxia Kiklos. 
39,"TEGAN: But Heathrow is on the M4, not Corfu. "
40,"DOCTOR: Oh, Adric's just showing off. He means the Milky Way, your"
41,galaxy. Ha! Massive magnetic field shift. 
42,ADRIC: Looks like some kind of a control room. 
43,DOCTOR: I suppose it could be part of the Piccadilly Line. 
44,TEGAN: Good. Then I can catch a train. 
45,"DOCTOR: No. No, no, wait, wait, wait. The atmosphere's wrong. "
46,TEGAN: What? 
47,"DOCTOR: Diminution of oxygen, nitrogen, traces of mercurial compound,"
48,intense proton activity. 
49,(The Doctor goes through the inner door.) 
50,NYSSA: I thought Earth was meant to be primitive. 
51,"TEGAN: Oh, did you. "
52,NYSSA: Their instrumentation is very advanced. That looks like a
53,resonant stroboscope. 
54,TEGAN: What's that when it's at home? 
55,NYSSA: But it is home. 
56,(The Doctor returns with a helmet that has a pair of oxygen cylinders
57,attached to the back.) 
58,"DOCTOR: Er, I'm going to take a look around. Now, none of you is to"
59,leave here. Is that clearly understood? Good. 
60,"(He puts on the helmet, opens the door and leaves.) "
61, [Spaceship] 
62, (The Doctor makes gestures of admiration and
63,delight at the equipment he finds. He flicks a switch on a panel then
64,"quickly flicks it back again. As he continues to explore, a black ball"
65,"floats in the air behind him, watching. The Doctor goes to the"
66,"bulkhead, flicks another switch and a shutter on a porthole opens to"
67,reveal the stars.) 
68,DOCTOR: Spaceship or laboratory? 
69, [Throne room] 
70, (The Doctor's exploration is being relayed by the
71,monopticons to a monitor.  Stratford Johns
72,"speaks, although we don't see anyone yet.) "
73,MONARCH : I would look at the intrusion again. 
74,(The ball backs up to show the Tardis.) 
75,MONARCH : Well? 
76,(A woman replies.) 
77,ENLIGHTENMENT : It is not in my memory. 
78,(A second man speaks.) 
79,PERSUASION : Nor in mine. 
80,MONARCH : I would look again at the humanoid. 
81,(The ball obeys.) 
82, [Tardis] 
83, (The Doctor is also on the scanner.) 
84,TEGAN: He's taking his time. 
85,ADRIC: Yes. I've never known him hurry anything. 
86,(Nyssa is reading Principia Mathematica by Alfred North Whitehead
87,instead of watching the scanner.) 
88,TEGAN: Is there another space pack? 
89,ADRIC: Yes. 
90,NYSSA: He told us to stay here. 
91,"TEGAN: Well, perhaps he's in trouble. "
92,"ADRIC: Oh, he's always in trouble, Tegan, or haven't you noticed? It"
93,amuses him. 
94,"TEGAN: Well, it doesn't amuse me. He promised to get me back to"
95,Heathrow. He'll lose me my job. 
96,"ADRIC: No, he won't. Be patient. "
97,TEGAN: Patient? After all I've been through since I came through that
98,door? My aunt reduced to so long. You must be joking. 
99,"ADRIC: Look, we're fifth dimensional in this thing. He'll get you on"
100,your flight if he's out there a week. 
101,TEGAN: And what do we do in the meantime? 
102,ADRIC: You could always read. 
103,TEGAN: Read? 
104,ADRIC: Yes. There's a fascinating book on maths through there by a chap
105,called Burt Russell. 
106,TEGAN: Maths? 
107,"ADRIC: That's the trouble with women. Mindless, impatient and bossy. "
108,TEGAN: You chauvinist. I heard that. 
109,ADRIC: You were meant to. 
110,NYSSA: I heard it too. You mean this? Mindless. 
111,"ADRIC: Well, yes, but you're not a woman. "
112,NYSSA: I'm not? 
113,ADRIC: No. You're only a girl. 
114, [Throne room] 
115, (The Doctor looks up at the ball watching him.) 
116,MONARCH : He now knows he's observed. 
117,ENLIGHTENMENT : What an enchanting smile. 
118, [Tardis] 
119, (The Doctor is nowhere to be seen on the scanner.)
120,
121,NYSSA: Still no sign of him. 
122,ADRIC: Can't be far. 
123,NYSSA: How do you know? 
124,"ADRIC: By the look of things, there's not really very far he can go. "
125,NYSSA: You don't know that either. Just look at that. 
126,ADRIC: What does that thing do? 
127,NYSSA: I thought you knew all about it. It increases density. 
128,ADRIC: What for? 
129,"NYSSA: To reduce matter, of course. "
130,ADRIC: What matter? 
131,"NYSSA: The Doctor's, perhaps? "
132,ADRIC: That's ridiculous. 
133,NYSSA: Is it? 
134, [Throne room] 
135, (The Doctor goes back inside the Tardis. The voice
136,in charge speaks to its computer.) 
137,"MONARCH : Control, report on the molecular structure of that"
138,artefact. 
139, [Tardis] 
140," DOCTOR: Well, we're in motion, so we can be pretty"
141,sure it's a spaceship. 
142,TEGAN: So much for promises. You've lost me my job. 
143,DOCTOR: Patience. 
144,TEGAN: Men. 
145,"DOCTOR: And it appears to be unmanned. Adric, through there, space"
146,packs. No need to bother with the visors. 
147,"ADRIC: Yes, Doctor. "
148,(Adric leaves.) 
149,"DOCTOR: There's a lot to interest you out there, young lady. Highly"
150,"advanced, innovative stuff. "
151,"NYSSA: That's a resonant stroboscope, isn't it. "
152,"DOCTOR: Yes. There appears to be nothing but machinery out there, but"
153,we are under scrutiny. There's a monopticon out there. 
154,NYSSA: What's that? 
155,"DOCTOR: Well, I suppose it would be best described as a sort of mobile"
156,black eye with a hypnotic stare. 
157,(Adric returns with the helmets.) 
158,"DOCTOR: Whoever or whatever is running this ship knows we're here, so"
159,"we'll have a little scrutiny for ourselves. Should we meet anyone, you"
160,"take your cue from me. (to Tegan) Spare key. Should we be separated, we"
161,come back here. 
162,TEGAN: But can't I stay here? 
163,"DOCTOR: Yes, if you like, stay here. Adric? "
164,(Tegan snatches the key.) 
165,"TEGAN: No, I'll come. "
166, [Spaceship] 
167, (The Doctor points out the monopticon to Tegan.) 
168,"DOCTOR: Hello, again. You must be having a ball. "
169, [Throne room] 
170, DOCTOR : Friends of mine. 
171,(The Doctor leads the group out of view.) 
172,CONTROL: Molecular structure of intruding artefact consistent with
173,destination Earth and its solar system. 
174, [Spaceship] 
175, DOCTOR: Amazing work. Worthy of Gallifrey.
176,"Non-corrosive alloys, saturated polymers. Highly advanced. "
177,NYSSA: Look at that! 
178,DOCTOR: Yes! An interferometer. 
179,ADRIC: What's that? 
180,NYSSA: This one's for measuring gravitation waves. 
181,DOCTOR: But we could use it on the time curve circuits. 
182,"NYSSA: Look, a graviton crystal detector. "
183,ADRIC: What's that for? 
184,NYSSA: Same thing. 
185,DOCTOR: Belts and braces. 
186,"NYSSA: Except on Traken, the interferometer superceded the crystal. "
187,DOCTOR: Yes. That's what's interesting. See if you can get it going. 
188, [Throne room] 
189, MONARCH : I would again look closer at the
190,tallest. He would appear to be the senior. 
191,"(The monopticon zooms in, and the Doctor smiles up at it.) "
192, [Spaceship] 
193, (The Doctor reaches out for the monopticon.) 
194,"DOCTOR: Ah, magnetic shield. Ahem. I mean you no harm. I wonder, could"
195,you tell me who or what you are? And where we are? 
196, [Throne room] 
197," MONARCH : They appear to be Earthlings, and"
198,this one not without intelligence or technological education. 
199, [Spaceship] 
200, (Adric has found a door.) 
201,"DOCTOR: I, er, I know we're trespassing, but I would like an"
202,"opportunity to explain the circumstances, if you'd be so kind. "
203,"ADRIC: Doctor, don't we have some kind of a sonic "
204,(The Doctor gestures Adric to be quiet.) 
205,"DOCTOR: So, your lips are sealed. Well, would it be in order for you to"
206,"take me to your leader? If you have a leader, that is. "
207,TEGAN: Look! A door! 
208,(A second door slides open at the top of a stairway.) 
209,"DOCTOR: Oh. Well, that's a friendly gesture. Thank you. Er, perhaps one"
210,"of us should stay with Nyssa, Adric. "
211,ADRIC: No! 
212,DOCTOR: Good man. Come on. We'll see you both later. 
213, [Linkway] 
214, (Another monopticon hangs in midair.) 
215,"DOCTOR: Ah, a twib. "
216,(The next door opens for them.) 
217,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
218, [Spaceship] 
219, (The monopticon is keeping a close eye on Adric.) 
220,"ADRIC: Look, just go away, will you? "
221,(It backs off.) 
222,NYSSA: Calm down. It won't bite. 
223,ADRIC: How do you know? 
224,NYSSA: Because. 
225,ADRIC: I don't know why the Doctor made me stay here anyway. 
226,NYSSA: Come over here. 
227,(She hands him some small items from a drawer in the bottom of the
228,detector.) 
229,ADRIC: He knows I'm no good with my hands. 
230, [Throne room] 
231, ENLIGHTENMENT : Her attire is interesting. It
232,obviously reflects a different culture. 
233,PERSUASION : How can Earthlings have penetrated us? 
234,ENLIGHTENMENT : Can they have learned the error of their ways? Are
235,they now pacified and cooperative? Is our arrival to be simpler than
236,expected? 
237,MONARCH : More. Can their technology now be advanced as mine? 
238, [Linkway] 
239, (The Doctor and Tegan come down a steep ladder and
240,carry on.) 
241,TEGAN: How much further? 
242,(Another door opens for them.) 
243, [Spaceship] 
244, (Adric and Nyssa try to move the piece of
245,"equipment, but it is too heavy for them.) "
246,"NYSSA: It's no good, we'll have to take the readings out here. You know"
247,"where the time curve circuits are, don't you? "
248,ADRIC: Of course. 
249,"NYSSA: Well, fetch them. I'll set up. "
250,(Adric goes into the Tardis.) 
251, [Throne room] 
252, (We get our first view of the three speakers as
253,the Doctor and Tegan enter. They are seated high up above their
254,"subjects, with Monarch highest of all, and wearing voluminous green"
255,gowns that hide their shapes. This is effectively the bridge of the
256,"spaceship, where they watch everything on a bank of monitors in front"
257,of them.) 
258,DOCTOR: Here we are. 
259,TEGAN: At last. 
260,MONARCH: Welcome. I am Monarch. 
261,(Tegan gasps at the greenish rough skin of the alien in charge.) 
262,DOCTOR: You look as if you might be. 
263,(Monarch gestures to his lower right.) 
264,MONARCH: And this is Enlightenment. 
265,"DOCTOR: Enlightenment, how do you do. "
266,ENLIGHTENMENT: How do you do. 
267,MONARCH: And this is Persuasion. 
268,"DOCTOR: Friendly, I hope. "
269,MONARCH: And you are? 
270,DOCTOR: I am the Doctor. 
271,ENLIGHTENMENT: A doctor? Of what? 
272,DOCTOR: Of everything. 
273,PERSUASION: How modest. 
274,MONARCH: An Earthling. 
275,"DOCTOR: A Gallifreyan. Tegan is an Earthling, Adric is an Alzarian, and"
276,Nyssa there is from Traken.) 
277,(Nyssa is on the monitor.) 
278,PERSUASION: You come in peace? 
279,"DOCTOR: Of course. And inadvertently, as a matter of fact. "
280,"MONARCH: Control, release full life support atmosphere, please. Remove"
281,your encumbrances. 
282,(The Doctor and Tegan take off their helmets.) 
283,DOCTOR: Thank you. May I ask who you are? 
284,"MONARCH: I am the supreme leader of the people of Urbanka, in the solar"
285,system of Inokshi in the galaxy RA one four eight nine. 
286,"DOCTOR: Goodness me, you are a long way from home. "
287,"MONARCH: As indeed are you. You must be tired. Control, refreshments"
288,for our guests. 
289,DOCTOR: You're very kind. 
290,MONARCH: I am merely civilised. 
291,ENLIGHTENMENT: Is that what the best-dressed Earthling women are
292,wearing these days? 
293,TEGAN: These days? 
294,ENLIGHTENMENT: It's two and a half thousand years since we were last
295,there. 
296,TEGAN: Two thousand five hundred years? 
297,"MONARCH: Yes, our planets are rather far apart. We come as often as we"
298,"can. Control, isolate the girl. "
299,(Monarch is keeping a close eye on what Nyssa is doing.) 
300,"DOCTOR: You know, I drop in from time to time myself, and nothing on"
301,Earth changes quite so often as the fashion. You wouldn't believe the
302,way some people look. Some of them even wear safety pins. 
303,ENLIGHTENMENT: Safety pins? 
304,PERSUASION: A defence mechanism? 
305,DOCTOR: Earrings. 
306,ENLIGHTENMENT: How barbaric. 
307,DOCTOR: Yes. A lot of it about. 
308,"ENLIGHTENMENT: Are you fashionable, Tegan? "
309,TEGAN: This is my uniform. 
310,ENLIGHTENMENT: What is your manner of dress when not in uniform? 
311,TEGAN: It's difficult to explain. Have you got a piece of paper? 
312,(The Doctor hands over a notebook.) 
313,TEGAN: Thanks. Pen? Pencil? 
314,(A propelling pencil.) 
315,TEGAN: That'll do. 
316,(Tegan settles down to do a sketch.) 
317, [Tardis] 
318, (Adric calls up a schematic to try and find the
319,"circuit. Outside, a door opens behind Nyssa and a man with a beard,"
320,"wearing a white toga, enters. She gasps.) "
321,ADRIC: Nyssa? Nyssa! Nyssa? 
322, [Spaceship] 
323, (Adric looks out of the Tardis.) 
324,"ADRIC: Nyssa? Nyssa? Where is she? I said, where is she? "
325,(A door opens at the far end of the compartment. Adric goes back to
326,"shut the Tardis door and then walks out, followed by the monopticon.) "
327, [Throne room] 
328," MONARCH: Is this one of your drop in times,"
329,Doctor? 
330,DOCTOR: Drop in times? 
331,MONARCH: Your visits to planet Earth. 
332,"DOCTOR: Yes, I promised to put Tegan on her plane. "
333,MONARCH: Her astral plane? 
334,"DOCTOR: Yes, in a sense. They go from Heathrow Airport. "
335,MONARCH: This is not Heathrow Airport. 
336,"DOCTOR: No, not even the quarantine area. "
337,MONARCH: Forgive my curiosity as to how your craft came aboard. 
338,DOCTOR: An error. My assistant miscalculated the coordinates. 
339,TEGAN: Too right he did. 
340,DOCTOR: Or it could have been your dense magnetic field causing a
341,fluctuation of my artron energy. 
342,MONARCH: What energy is that? 
343,(Adric is on his way to the bridge.) 
344,MONARCH: You possess an energy you do not understand? 
345,"DOCTOR: Yes. Silly, isn't it. Only my professor at the Academy seemed"
346,to understand it. Just goes to show how academic everything is. 
347,"MONARCH: Hmm. Ah, the boy who got his sums wrong. "
348,"ADRIC: No, I didn't. I'm a mathematician. "
349,"MONARCH: Mathematician, eh? Well, what do you understand by e=mc2 "
350,ADRIC: Doctor. 
351,"DOCTOR: Come on, Adric, explain the formula. "
352,"ADRIC: Doctor, where's Nyssa? Energy equals mass time the speed of"
353,light squared. 
354,MONARCH: You grasp the theory of relativity? 
355,ADRIC: Doesn't everyone? 
356,"TEGAN: No, I don't. And if we don't get back to Heathrow, I'm going to"
357,lose my job. 
358,ADRIC: Study maths and you might get a better one. 
359,TEGAN: I don't want a better one. 
360,"DOCTOR: Come along, children. Not in front of our hosts. "
361,"(Tegan hands her sketch over to Enlightenment, who peers at it"
362,short-sightedly.) 
363,MONARCH: You will be escorted to your refreshments. 
364,"DOCTOR: Thank you, Monarch. "
365,PERSUASION: Majesty. 
366,DOCTOR: Majesty. 
367,"(The Doctor, Tegan and Adric leave. Enlightenment looks at the sketch"
368,"of a man in a double-breasted suit, and a woman in shift dress with"
369,leggings.) 
370,"MONARCH: Well done, Enlightenment. These will eliminate the need for"
371,"telemicrographics, and may prove to be more reliable. I would inspect"
372,their craft. 
373, [Linkway] 
374, (The monopticon leads them down a staircase.) 
375,"ADRIC: But, look, Doctor "
376,DOCTOR: I'm sure she's all right. 
377, [Refreshment room] 
378, (They enter a room with a table and seven metal
379,"chairs, and Nyssa. She removes her helmet when she sees they are not"
380,wearing theirs.) 
381,DOCTOR: What did I tell you? 
382,ADRIC: Are you all right? 
383,NYSSA: Just about. 
384,"DOCTOR: Ah, there you are. That's reassuring. "
385,(The monopticon hovers above their heads.) 
386, [Spaceship] 
387, (Monarch goes over to the Tardis.) 
388,MONARCH: Laser key. 
389,(A laser rises from a unit and aims its red light at the Tardis lock.
390,It does not open.) 
391,MONARCH: Directional cobalt flux. 
392,"(Blue fuzzy energy fails, too.) "
393,MONARCH: This artefact is too primitive to defy my technology. 
394, [Refreshment room] 
395," NYSSA: Doctor, I tell you it was a humanoid. "
396,(Who enters carrying a heavily laded tray.) 
397,BIGON: Welcome. My name is Bigon. 
398,(Pronounced By-gone.) 
399,"DOCTOR: Hello. I'm the Doctor. This is Tegan, Adric and Nyssa. "
400,BIGON: We've met. 
401,DOCTOR: Are you an Earthling? 
402,BIGON: Yes. 
403,DOCTOR: Greek? 
404,BIGON: Athenian. 
405,DOCTOR: What are you doing here? 
406,BIGON: Will it please you to eat and drink? A simple meal. Vegetarian.
407,"Citrus fruits, apples, nut, avocado pears and grape juice. "
408,(All in little compartments in the trays.) 
409,"ADRIC: Oh, a small river fruit. "
410,BIGON: Avocado pear. 
411,"ADRIC: Er, could anyone pass the sodium chloride, please? "
412,TEGAN: Sodium chloride? 
413,"DOCTOR: Salt. If you're an Earthling, how do you come to be on this"
414,ship? 
415,"(A door opens and an Australian aborigine enters, complete with"
416,"loincloth, decorative scars and white paint on the forehead.) "
417,KURKUTJI: Oolalaga itanga Kurkutji. Iyinta oogana intanda. 
418,TEGAN: Angalawe itanga Tegan. 
419,KURKUTJI: Tegan. No ango p'unkupo. 
420,TEGAN: U'unkupo. Maka nempita? 
421,DOCTOR: You speak the dialect? 
422,"TEGAN: Well, he's an Australian aborigine. "
423,"(Who currently have about three thousand different dialects, and this"
424,guy isn't from now....) 
425,"DOCTOR: Well, I know that. What's he saying? "
426,"TEGAN: Well, he's welcoming us in the name of peace. "
427,DOCTOR: What's he doing here? 
428,TEGAN: I was asking. 
429,DOCTOR: Sorry to interrupt. 
430,TEGAN: Make nempita kukuch? 
431,KURKUTJI: Koolalaka kap ti pampoon. 
432,TEGAN: He says he's going walkabout to the time of the dreaming. 
433,DOCTOR: The dreaming? 
434,TEGAN: Heaven. He says he's going to heaven. We're all going to heaven.
435,
436, [Throne room] 
437," (Monarch sits alone, watching.) "
438,"MONARCH: As I've always said, out of the mouths of primates and"
439,primitives. 
440, [Refreshment room] 
441, DOCTOR: When does he expect to get there? 
442,TEGAN: I'm frightened. 
443,NYSSA: So am I. 
444,DOCTOR: Is that where you're going? 
445,BIGON: I'm not a believer. 
446,"DOCTOR: No, of course you're not. "
447,(An elegant South American woman in yellow enters.) 
448,BIGON: Allow me to present Princess Villagra. 
449,"DOCTOR: How do you do, your Highness. "
450,BIGON: The princess has vowed not to talk again until she is reunited
451,with her people. 
452,DOCTOR: Who are her people? 
453,BIGON: The Mayan people of the Americas. 
454,"DOCTOR: Goodness, that's going back a bit. "
455,"(Finally,  Burt"
456,Kwouk enters in quilted Mandarin jacket to complete the
457,cast.) 
458,LIN FUTU: Greetings. 
459,DOCTOR: Greetings. 
460,LIN FUTU: I am Lin Futu. 
461,"DOCTOR: Well, I'd never have guessed it. You look in the best of health"
462,to me. 
463,LIN FUTU: Thank you. 
464,DOCTOR: You're all Earthlings. What are you doing on this ship? Are you
465,"hostages, is that it? "
466, [Throne room] 
467," DOCTOR : Well, Bigon? "
468,MONARCH: Tell them nothing. 
469, [Refreshment room] 
470, (The monopticon beeps.) 
471,BIGON: You have not been told by Monarch? 
472,DOCTOR: No. 
473,BIGON: Then we must be silent on this. 
474,"(Two people come down the stairs, looking exactly like Tegan's fashion"
475,sketch. The clothes are green.) 
476,ENLIGHTENMENT: His Majesty commands me to tell you that we arrive on
477,planet Earth in four days. He invites you to complete your journey as
478,his guests. 
479,"DOCTOR: Well, that's very civil of His Majesty. Who are you? "
480,"PERSUASION: We've already met. This is Enlightenment, and I am"
481,Persuasion. 
482, Part Two
483,
484, [Refreshment room] 
485," DOCTOR: Goodness, how you've changed. "
486,TEGAN: You're what I sketched. 
487,"ENLIGHTENMENT: Yes. You're a very good draughtswoman, my dear. "
488,TEGAN: I want to go. 
489,ENLIGHTENMENT: There's no need to be frightened. Please. 
490,TEGAN: I'm not frightened. 
491,ADRIC: How did you do it? Change like that. 
492,ENLIGHTENMENT: We enjoy the most advanced technology in the universe. 
493,"(Persuasion pours Tegan a drink, and carries on round the table.) "
494,DOCTOR: Magical. 
495,"ENLIGHTENMENT: No, not magic, Doctor. A skill like any other. "
496,ADRIC: You mean anyone can do it? 
497,ENLIGHTENMENT: Yes. 
498,ADRIC: Me? 
499,"ENLIGHTENMENT: If you wished. But you have no need, yet. "
500,DOCTOR: But you have. 
501,ENLIGHTENMENT: As you have seen. 
502,PERSUASION: The dominant emotion on planet Earth is fear. When last we
503,"were there, our reception was hostile. "
504,"TEGAN: Yeah, that doesn't surprise me. "
505,"DOCTOR: Well, we must read your history books. "
506,ENLIGHTENMENT: You will be welcome to do so. It will be necessary for
507,me to instruct you in our computer languages. 
508,DOCTOR: One couldn't wish for a more enchanting teacher. 
509,PERSUASION: A very elevated one. 
510,DOCTOR: Enlightenment. 
511,PERSUASION: Minister of Enlightenment. 
512,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. And you must be Minister of Persuasion. "
513, [Throne room] 
514," MONARCH: Close watch, this Doctor. Control, report"
515,"what is known of this being, also Gallifrey and artron energy. "
516, [Refreshment room] 
517, DOCTOR: May one ask the purpose of your journey to
518,planet Earth? 
519,PERSUASION: Resettlement. 
520,"ENLIGHTENMENT: Our planet, Urbanka, no longer exists. Inokshi, our sun,"
521,was an irregular variable. It collapsed a thousand years ago. 
522,PERSUASION: We left before the end. 
523,ENLIGHTENMENT: In time to escape the black hole. 
524,DOCTOR: Many of you? 
525,ENLIGHTENMENT: Three billion. 
526,ADRIC: Three billion? How many ships? 
527,ENLIGHTENMENT: One. 
528,ADRIC: One! 
529,ENLIGHTENMENT: This one. 
530, [Throne room] 
531, MONARCH: They have been told enough. 
532, [Refreshment room] 
533, (The monopticon beeps. Persuasion turns slightly
534,to acknowledge the instruction.) 
535,"DOCTOR: Yes, well. "
536, [Throne room] 
537," CONTROL: Data on Doctor, Gallifrey, artron energy"
538,"not memory banked. Inference, fifth dimension. "
539,MONARCH: This Doctor cannot have brought mathematics further than I.
540,Infer again. 
541,CONTROL: The occult. 
542,MONARCH: Superstition? No. Isolate them. I must know more about them. 
543, [Refreshment room] 
544," ENLIGHTENMENT: Now that you are refreshed, you"
545,must see your quarters. Bigon will show you. He was the last to use
546,them. 
547,DOCTOR: I see. So we've accepted your invitation? 
548,"PERSUASION: Graciously, of course. "
549,BIGON: This way please. 
550,"(Bigon leads Tegan, Adric and Nyssa out.) "
551,DOCTOR: Au revoir. 
552,ENLIGHTENMENT: I hope so. 
553,(The Doctor leaves.) 
554, [Linkway] 
555, (A door slides open.) 
556,BIGON: Here you will be comfortable. I was. 
557, [Guest quarters] 
558, TEGAN: Yikes. 
559,"(It is a big room, with lots of angular metal sheet construction.) "
560,ADRIC: Where are the others? 
561,BIGON: My boy? 
562,ADRIC: The rest of the three billion. 
563,BIGON: I'm sure that Monarch or one of his ministers will wish to
564,satisfy your curiosity. 
565,DOCTOR: I hope we're not putting you out. 
566,"BIGON: No, I have no need of this accommodation now. "
567,DOCTOR: You're with your family? 
568,BIGON: I have no family. Not since I was rescued from Earth a hundred
569,generations ago. 
570, [Throne room] 
571, MONARCH: Why does the old fool have to chatter? 
572, [Guest quarters] 
573, BIGON: I must leave you now. 
574,"(The door closes behind Bigon. Tegan tries to open it, and fails.) "
575,TEGAN: We're shut in. 
576,ADRIC: A hundred generations. 
577,"DOCTOR: Seems young for his age, don't you think? "
578,ADRIC: But three billion people? How big can this ship be? 
579,NYSSA: It's impossible. 
580,DOCTOR: On the face of it. 
581,TEGAN: I want to get out of here. I want to get off this ship. I don't
582,want to be rescued. 
583,ADRIC: Make up your mind. 
584,"TEGAN: Well, can you get us out of here? Can you get us back to the"
585,Tardis? 
586,"DOCTOR: Oh, I don't anticipate a great deal of difficulty. "
587,TEGAN: Good. Then I want to go now! 
588,"DOCTOR: I knew a sailor once, friend of mine, chap named Drake. "
589,TEGAN: What's that got to do with it? 
590,"DOCTOR: He said something like, there's time enough to get to Terminal"
591,three and beat the Armada too. 
592,ADRIC: Armada? 
593,DOCTOR: Could there really be more than one of these? 
594,(The Doctor backs away towards a watching monopticon holding his hat
595,and sonic screwdriver.) 
596, [Throne room] 
597," (On the monitor, they only see the Doctor's back.)"
598,
599,MONARCH: This Doctor interests me more and more. On no account is he to
600,leave. 
601,(The Doctor puts his hat over the monopticon's eye. Then he puts away
602,the screwdriver and takes out another pen-like device.) 
603,MONARCH: And now he's blocked out the sound. Here we have a lively
604,intelligence. He could make a valuable ally. 
605,"PERSUASION: Or a dangerous enemy, your Majesty. "
606,"ENLIGHTENMENT: He is too jocular, irresponsible. Such a being prefers"
607,mental anarchy. They call it freedom. 
608,"MONARCH: What nonsense, the pair of you. I have eliminated the concept"
609,of opposition. 
610,"PERSUASION: I was thinking of Bigon, your Majesty. "
611,MONARCH: Bigon cannot oppose. 
612,PERSUASION: But he does not conform. 
613,"MONARCH: Well, of course. He's a philosopher, a doubter. We need doubt."
614,It's the greatest intellectual galvaniser. 
615,"ENLIGHTENMENT: With respect, your Majesty, there is a sensitivity in"
616,his persona which suggests what in the flesh time was called soul. 
617,"MONARCH: It's the first time, Enlightenment, I've heard you blaspheme. "
618,ENLIGHTENMENT: I beg your Majesty's pardon. 
619,MONARCH: I should think so. Flesh time indeed. You approach lese
620,majeste when you put the soul into the past tense. 
621, [Guest quarters] 
622, TEGAN: Must you make that awful noise? 
623,"DOCTOR: If our conversation is to remain private, yes. "
624,ADRIC: They must be lying or mad. Three billion people on one ship?
625,It'll never get off the ground. 
626,"TEGAN: Of course they're mad. A hundred generations on this thing,"
627,they've got to be mad. 
628,"DOCTOR: She didn't talk of people, she talked of population. "
629,ADRIC: Comes to the same thing. 
630,"DOCTOR: Sloppy thinking, Adric. Do you know there are at least three"
631,billion bacteria in this chamber alone? And if a frog with a funny head
632,can turn itself into a semblance of a human being in a matter of
633,"minutes, there isn't much of a limit to what it can't do. To say"
634,nothing of the dress-making. 
635,NYSSA: All that's not so difficult. 
636,ADRIC: Not difficult? 
637,NYSSA: These Urbankans are terribly advanced. 
638,TEGAN: Terribly is too right. 
639,"NYSSA: I understand bioengineering, but I'm also an expert in"
640,cybernetics. 
641,TEGAN: What's cybernetics? 
642,NYSSA: A science concerned with the control mechanisms of machines. 
643,TEGAN: What machines? I've seen three large frogs and four very
644,peculiar human beings. 
645,"NYSSA: No, you've seen more than that. You saw two sketches you made"
646,come to life. 
647,TEGAN: Don't remind me. 
648,NYSSA: I'm sure machines did that. 
649,TEGAN: But we're talking of flesh and blood. 
650,"DOCTOR: I am beginning to wonder. I mean, here we are, four days from"
651,Earth on a spaceship with three billion and three frogs. And four
652,"Earthlings. Why? Wait a minute, wait a minute. How long is one hundred"
653,generations? 
654,ADRIC: What's generation in years? 
655,DOCTOR: Call it twenty five. 
656,ADRIC: Two thousand five hundred years. 
657,DOCTOR: Right. Right. So it's at least two thousand five hundred years
658,"since our hosts last visited Earth when they rescued Bigon. Now, if the"
659,return journey to Urbanka takes the same time as the journey to Earth.
660,"How's your ancient history, Tegan? "
661,"TEGAN: Like I feel, awful. "
662,"DOCTOR: Well, not to worry, mine's pretty good. Now, the Futu dynasty"
663,"in China I would put at four thousand years ago, the Mayans in South"
664,"American flourished eight thousand years ago, and Kurkutji the"
665,aborigine says it's so long since he was taken he can't remember. How
666,about twelve thousand years? 
667,TEGAN: But that's mad. 
668,"DOCTOR: Yes, so you keep saying, Tegan. Is anyone saying you're wrong? "
669,ADRIC: I am. I think it's brilliant. 
670,NYSSA: So do I. Pure logic. 
671,DOCTOR: Or maybe Tegan's right. Why do it? 
672,TEGAN: Are you saying that this aborigine was taken twelve thousand
673,years ago? 
674,"DOCTOR: No, but his ancestor was. Wouldn't be the first time that whole"
675,generations have known of no other life than a spaceship. 
676,TEGAN: Then what are you saying? 
677,DOCTOR: I'm saying that the Urbankans have visited Earth four times and
678,"taken at least one cultural representative, and this time they're"
679,"coming for good. Well, I say good. Three billion Earthlings plus three"
680,"billion Urbankans, I really don't think so. I really don't think so at"
681,all. 
682,ADRIC: Then what are we going to do? 
683,DOCTOR: Explore. 
684, [Throne room] 
685," PERSUASION: What action shall I take, your"
686,Majesty? 
687,"MONARCH: None. He will take the action. He has a sonic device,"
688,primitive but effective. He'll want to explore. Arrange a recreational
689,"to divert him, but keep him separated from the boy or girl. They will"
690,tell me more about this Doctor than he will himself. 
691, [Guest quarters] 
692, (The Doctor picks up his helmet.) 
693,DOCTOR: Bring these. 
694,(The sonic screwdriver opens the door with ease.) 
695, [Linkway] 
696, (A monopticon backs away and a door opens for
697,"them. It shuts again before Adric and Nyssa can go through, but another"
698,door opens further down.) NYSSA: What should we do? 
699,ADRIC: Come on. 
700,"(Nyssa and Adric go through the other door. Going down a set of stairs,"
701,Tegan realises.) 
702,"TEGAN: Doctor, we've lost the others. "
703,(The Doctor goes back to the door. It won't open for the screwdriver.) 
704,DOCTOR: Hmm. I get the feeling we were meant to lose them. 
705,TEGAN: But we can't just leave them. 
706,"DOCTOR: Oh? What do you suggest? Come on, and try to keep calm. We'll"
707,get nowhere if you lose your head. 
708,(A door opens.) 
709, [Throne room] 
710," (On the monitor, Nyssa and Adric go down some"
711,stairs.) 
712,"MONARCH: Let them move freely. In the meantime, Enlightenment, I will"
713,examine Bigon. 
714,ENLIGHTENMENT: Your Majesty. 
715,(Enlightenment leaves.) 
716, [Recreation space] 
717, (Four Mayan woman are performing a dance around
718,Villagra to the sound of reed flutes. Lin Futu and Kurkutji watch on
719,"the ground floor, whilst more aborigines and other races watch from the"
720,upper level. The Doctor and Tegan enter on the upper level. One of the
721,"hoplites is wearing trainers. Tut, tut.) "
722,DOCTOR: More Earthlings. Hello? Some sort of entertainment. 
723,(Persuasion joins them.) 
724,PERSUASION: Welcome to our recreational. 
725,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
726,PERSUASION: Where are your junior companions? 
727,DOCTOR: I'm afraid they've got lost. You know what children are. 
728,"PERSUASION: No, I don't, as it happens, but they won't get far. Please."
729,
730,(He leads them to some empty seats.) 
731,PERSUASION: We have these little soirees from time to time. It is a
732,"recreation from work and study, and representative of the different"
733,cultures. 
734,DOCTOR: How is Urbanka represented? 
735,PERSUASION: We have no comparable culture. Such concepts are for the
736,primitive. 
737,(He leaves them.) 
738, [Throne room] 
739," (Enlightenment has brought Bigon, as ordered.) "
740,MONARCH: You must resist the temptation to tell this Doctor about my
741,mission. 
742,BIGON: I have been telling the truth for over two and a half thousand
743,years. 
744,MONARCH: Then keep silent. You weren't made immortal to engage in
745,endless gossip. I want to know more about this Doctor before I tell him
746,of the ultimate. 
747,"BIGON: When you do this, his hand will be against you. "
748,MONARCH: Then I will cut it off. 
749,BIGON: We cannot find the ultimate. There is no ultimate to find. 
750,MONARCH: I have heard enough blasphemy for one day. If it weren't for
751,"me, you'd still believe your Earth is flat. Now hold your tongue! This"
752,Doctor will know about us when I know more about him. Now leave us! 
753, [Flora chamber] 
754, (Aborigines are tending the plants and using the
755,computer controlled equipment.) 
756,ADRIC: Very bright light. 
757,NYSSA: For photosynthesis. 
758,ADRIC: What's that? 
759,NYSSA: The light on the plants converts carbon dioxide into
760,carbohydrate. The plants give off oxygen. 
761,ADRIC: Hello. 
762,(The men ignore them so they leave.) 
763, [Recreation room] 
764, (The Mayan dance finishes. They turn and make
765,"obeisance to Persuasion. Next, Lin Futu summons two sets of dragon"
766,dancers.) 
767,TEGAN: Shouldn't we look for the others? 
768,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. As Percy over there said, they can't be far. "
769,TEGAN: What if they harm them? 
770,DOCTOR: Why should they? 
771,"TEGAN: I don't know why, but I think they will. "
772,DOCTOR: Nonsense. Wouldn't make any sense. 
773,"TEGAN: It doesn't have to. I think they're mad. I think you are, too. "
774,"DOCTOR: Well, take the advice of a mad man and look happy. "
775,TEGAN: Why? 
776,DOCTOR: Try to look as if you're enjoying yourself. In these situations
777,it's the best form of defence. And it gives me time to think. 
778, [Throne room] 
779, (Nyssa and Adric are lured through a door into a
780,area with low oxygen. They begin to gasp for air.) 
781,ENLIGHTENMENT: They have lungs. 
782,MONARCH: Let them remember that. 
783, [Library]

785,ADRIC: Not enough oxygen.

789,"(Adric touches one man's arm, but he takes no notice.) "
790,ADRIC: He's ice cold. 
791,(Nyssa takes the man's arm.) 
792,NYSSA: They've all got one of these. 
793,"(A shiny disc on the back of their left hand, about two centimetres"
794,across. Nyssa tries to remove it.)

802,ADRIC: Come on. 
803, [Recreation room] 
804, (The dragon dance finishes. Bigon enters and
805,summons two hoplites in leather armour with circular shields and short
806,"swords, then joins the Doctor and Tegan on the balcony to watch.) "
807,BIGON: I want to look as if I'm explaining the contest. I must see you
808,in private as soon as possible. 
809,DOCTOR: I fancy I've made our quarters private enough. 
810,BIGON: Good. Could you divert the attention of a monopticon? 
811,DOCTOR: I'll do my best. 
812,"BIGON: In ten seconds, please. "
813,(Bigon moves away and sits at near the door.) 
814,DOCTOR: Act up to me. 
815,(The Doctor stands then collapses.) 
816,TEGAN: Doctor! 
817,(Persuasion and a monopticon are attracted to the incident. Bigon
818,leaves unnoticed.) 
819,"PERSUASION: Are you not well, Doctor? "
820,"DOCTOR: Quite all right, thank you. Just a dizzy spell. Must be the"
821,altitude. 
822, [Throne room] 
823, ENLIGHTENMENT: What a fatuous remark. 
824,"MONARCH: Ah, the flesh time. "
825, [Recreation room] 
826," (A little later, the hoplites are still twirling"
827,and hitting each other's shields with their short swords.) 
828,TEGAN: What was all that about? 
829,DOCTOR: A little diversion. I think we're on to something. Bigon wants
830,to talk to me. 
831, [Mobiliary] 
832, (Adric and Nyssa enter the area where the Chinese
833,contingent are working at computers too.) 
834,"ADRIC: I don't suppose it's worth speaking to any of this lot, either. "
835,NYSSA: Look. An electron microscope. 
836,ADRIC: What's this? 
837,(An observation port into somewhere glowing red.) 
838,NYSSA: Looks like an induction furnace. 
839, [Throne room] 
840," ENLIGHTENMENT: Is it wise, your Majesty, to let"
841,the children see the Mobiliary chamber? 
842,MONARCH: Enlightenment questions my wisdom? 
843,ENLIGHTENMENT: They will communicate with the others. 
844,MONARCH: Certainly. But I intend to control and qualify that
845,communication. 
846, [Mobiliary] 
847, (They watch as one Chinese man works on the disc
848,of another.) 
849,ADRIC: What do they do in here? 
850,(Nyssa looks up at the monopticon.) 
851, [Recreation room] 
852," (Finally, the hoplites have their shields knocked"
853,"out of their hands, then one stabs the other through the heart. The"
854,corpse is dragged away to applause. Tegan grabs her helmet and runs
855,out. The Doctor follows her and misses the aboriginal dance to the
856,music of didgeridoos.) 
857, [Guest quarters] 
858," (Tegan runs in and sits down, in tears. Bigon is"
859,there. The Doctor enters and turns on the sound interference. His hat
860,is still over the monopticon's eye.) 
861,DOCTOR: I can't say I share your taste in entertainment. 
862,(Bigon tries to comfort Tegan.) 
863,BIGON: It is not as it seems. 
864, [Mobiliary] 
865, (The two hoplites enter. The one with the sword
866,wound in his chest goes and lies down on the couch where the Chinese
867,man had been earlier. Chinese technicians lower a transparent cover
868,over the couch. It fills with bright light for a few moments then is
869,raised again. The chest wound has vanished. The hoplite gets up and
870,takes his sword and shield from his opponent.) 
871,NYSSA: So that's what they do in here. 
872, [Throne room] 
873, MONARCH: Bring the children to me. 
874,(The monopticon beeps and the hoplites advance on Nyssa and Adric.) 
875, [Guest quarters] 
876, TEGAN: So you were right. 
877,"DOCTOR: Four visits, every four thousand years or so. "
878,"BIGON: No, the first visit was over thirty five thousand years ago,"
879,when Kurkutji was taken. It took twenty thousand years for the
880,Urbankans to reach Earth. Monarch has doubled the speed of the ship on
881,every subsequent visit. 
882,TEGAN: So you last left Urbanka twelve hundred and fifty years ago? 
883,DOCTOR: How can organic life endure that long? 
884,BIGON: The only organic life aboard is in the Flora chamber. This
885,compound is not me. 
886,"(Bigon stands, and opens the front of his toga. He peels back his chest"
887,"to reveal mechanisms inside, then he lifts up his face to show more"
888,"workings, and puts it down again. Finally, he takes out a small"
889,component on the end of a computer cable.) 
890,BIGON: This is me. 
891, Part Three
892,
893, [Guest quarters] 
894, BIGON: This is my memory of two thousand five
895,"hundred and fifty five years, linked to that, which is my reason, my"
896,"intelligence, linked to that, which is my motor power. "
897,DOCTOR: Incredible engineering. 
898,BIGON: This compound is a polymer stretched over a non-corrosive steel
899,frame. 
900,TEGAN: It's wicked. Evil. 
901,"BIGON: Not in itself. As with all technology, it is the use to which it"
902,is put. 
903,DOCTOR: Exactly. Just three silicon chips. 
904,BIGON: My reasoning chip contains more circuits than there are synapses
905,"in your brain, Doctor, each linked by lines one hundred nanometres"
906,thick. 
907,TEGAN: What's a nanometre? 
908,"DOCTOR: Oh, a thousand millionth of a metre. "
909,"TEGAN: No. I'm sorry, I can't believe that. "
910,"DOCTOR: Well, like it or not, Tegan, you're looking at a fact, if not a"
911,fact of life. This ship contains the entire population of Urbanka. Nine
912,billion silicon chips. 
913,"BIGON: Not so many. Some are slaves, robots. They have but one chip,"
914,the motor circuit. Those are they that wear the discs. 
915,"DOCTOR: So, the Aborigine, the Chinaman and the Mayan are "
916,"BIGON: All as I, yes. The leaders of four ethnic groups. "
917, [Throne room] 
918, (The hoplites have brought Adric and Nyssa to the
919,Urbankans.) 
920,"MONARCH: So you see, I mean you no harm. "
921,NYSSA: You're androids. 
922,"MONARCH: Oh no, girl, don't irritate me. And above all, don't"
923,disappoint me. I hold you to be intelligent. I've already explained
924,simply and succinctly that we're fully integrated personalities with a
925,racial memory. 
926,"ADRIC: Then what are these, your Majesty? "
927,(Adric points over his shoulder at a hoplite.) 
928,"MONARCH: No, no, no. There must be a class system. It is absolutely"
929,essential for good government. Now these are second-class citizens. You
930,could call them assisters. 
931,NYSSA: Or slaves. 
932,"MONARCH: If you will, girl. It is, however, a very emotive word. "
933,ENLIGHTENMENT: Very flesh time. 
934,ADRIC: Flesh time? 
935,ENLIGHTENMENT: It is the name Monarch to the primitive time. In your
936,"terms, the time of the chickenpox, of hunger and heart disease,"
937,"arthritis, bronchitis and the common cold. "
938,MONARCH: I have over thrown the greatest tyranny in the universe.
939,External and internal organs. 
940,NYSSA: What about love? 
941,MONARCH: Love? 
942,"ENLIGHTENMENT: The exchange of two fantasies, your Majesty. "
943,"(She's quoting Renoir, La Regle du Jeu.) "
944,"MONARCH: Ah. Thank you, Enlightenment. Oh, my children, I would like to"
945,"have held you captive by my words, not by assisters. "
946,"ADRIC: But you have, your Majesty. "
947,MONARCH: My boy? 
948,ADRIC: What you've done is almost beyond belief. You've performed a
949,miracle. 
950,"MONARCH: Did you hear that, Enlightenment? We have been receiving"
951,messages from Earth for fifty years. Have you ever heard a more
952,intelligent statement? Release them. Release them at once. 
953,(The hoplites back away.) 
954,MONARCH: You will be invaluable to me in my crusade. 
955,ADRIC: Crusade? 
956,MONARCH: To come to the aid of the Earthlings. To save them from
957,themselves. They're not as intelligent as you. They war amongst
958,themselves. They make more weapons than food and two thirds of them are
959,starving. It is all a problem of the flesh time. We come to rid them of
960,it. 
961,NYSSA: Perhaps they don't want to be rid of it. 
962,"ADRIC: Well, that's silly, Nyssa. How can anyone want to live like"
963,that? 
964,MONARCH: He's right. 
965,"ENLIGHTENMENT: Think, girl. Think. "
966,NYSSA: I am thinking. 
967, [Guest quarters] 
968, BIGON: We have been made immortal. 
969,DOCTOR: So it would seem. As long as you have spare parts you could go
970,on forever. 
971,(The Doctor is tossing a cricket ball in his left hand.) 
972,DOCTOR: All you need is the raw materials. 
973,BIGON: The reason for Monarch's invasion of Earth. The visits
974,established its suitability. 
975,"DOCTOR: Of course! That's it, he's after the silicon. "
976,TEGAN: What? 
977,DOCTOR: One of the biggest components of the Earth's crust is silicon.
978,All the chips he wants. 
979,BIGON: And the fossilisation. 
980,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, carbon too. "
981,BIGON: First he intends to replace the population of Earth with his
982,own. 
983,"TEGAN: What, three billion people? "
984,BIGON: He can do it. The landing will be peaceful. He has prepared a
985,message of peace and will offer them the help of his advanced alien
986,intelligence. That is why he will want your help. To convince the
987,people of Earth that he means them no harm. 
988,TEGAN: He'll get no help from me. 
989,BIGON: Don't be too sure. In the Mobiliary there is a deadly poison.
990,The deadliest in the known universe. The Urbankans secreted it in a
991,gland. It causes organic matter to shrink in on itself. One trillionth
992,of a gram would reduce you to the size of a grain of salt. With this he
993,will conquer Earth. 
994, [Throne room] 
995, ENLIGHTENMENT: We bring enlightenment. 
996,NYSSA: And persuasion. 
997,"PERSUASION: That, too. "
998,"ADRIC: Just think of it, Nyssa. A whole new technology. No more hunger,"
999,"no more wars. Fine schools, fine hospitals "
1000,NYSSA: Fine tyranny. 
1001,"ENLIGHTENMENT: You should guard against the arrogance of the scientist,"
1002,"Nyssa. As a bioengineer, you, more than most, should marvel at the"
1003,might of our Monarch. He led us from the Urbankan slime first to
1004,"conquer the land, then the elements, to develop the greatest technology"
1005,in the universe. 
1006,"MONARCH: You mustn't be too hard on the child, Enlightenment. She has"
1007,spirit and courage and a fine independence. Such qualities will be
1008,useful. She'll come round in the end. 
1009,NYSSA: Never to tyranny. I can never forget that my father was killed
1010,by a tyrant. 
1011,"ADRIC: Well, now you're being unreasonable, Nyssa. One simply can't"
1012,compare his Majesty to the Master. 
1013,MONARCH: Who is this Master? 
1014,"ADRIC: A Time Lord, your Majesty, and the Doctor's greatest enemy. "
1015, [Guest quarters] 
1016," BIGON: Unless he is stopped, he will eventually"
1017,destroy Earth just as he destroyed Urbanka. 
1018,DOCTOR: I thought he said Urbanka's son was a supernova? 
1019,BIGON: A lie. He exhausted the planet of its minerals and then polluted
1020,it with his technology. The pollution destroyed the ozone layer and
1021,left ultraviolet light to scorch Urbanka. 
1022,DOCTOR: And all this for what? 
1023,BIGON: His great plan. For him to travel faster than light. 
1024,DOCTOR: What? 
1025,BIGON: Monarch is obsessed with solving the riddle of the universe. 
1026,DOCTOR: Absurd. So he believes that to travel faster than light would
1027,"mean going backwards in time, back to the Big Bang? "
1028,BIGON: And beyond. Monarch believes he will meet himself there. He
1029,believes he is God. 
1030, [Throne room] 
1031," MONARCH: I grieve you, my child, that your father"
1032,"should have met such a fate. So, this Doctor of yours is also a Time"
1033,"Lord, eh? "
1034,"ADRIC: Yes, your Majesty. "
1035,MONARCH: Whence comes his power? 
1036,ADRIC: From other Time Lords. He speaks of the one called Rassilon. 
1037,ENLIGHTENMENT: There is a galactic legend about a Rassilon. He who
1038,found the Eye of Harmony. 
1039,"MONARCH: You know very well, Enlightenment, I regard such tales as"
1040,superstition. 
1041,"ENLIGHTENMENT: Yes, your Majesty. "
1042,"MONARCH: Yes, now tell me more about this Time Lord Doctor. He seems to"
1043,be a very agreeable person. 
1044,ADRIC: Yes. 
1045,MONARCH: He has a powerful mind. 
1046,"ADRIC: Yes, yes. "
1047,"MONARCH: Yes, I like that. Has he any power outside his machine? "
1048,"ADRIC: Well, he has two hearts. "
1049,"MONARCH: Oh, poor fellow. That must make him very vulnerable. "
1050,ADRIC: And he has the ability to go into a trance that suspends life
1051,functions. 
1052,"MONARCH: Oh, that must be useful. But I'm interested in this er,"
1053,machine of his. 
1054,ADRIC: The Tardis. 
1055,MONARCH: Hmm? 
1056,ADRIC: Short for Time And Relative Dimensions In Space. 
1057,"MONARCH: Fascinating. It's very small. I mean, is it not uncomfortable."
1058,
1059,"ADRIC: No, the interior's in a different dimension. "
1060,MONARCH: Really? 
1061,"ADRIC: Yes, it's quite large. "
1062,NYSSA: Why don't you shut up! 
1063,"MONARCH: Oh, mind your manners, my dear. Go on, boy. "
1064,"ADRIC: Oh. Well, it's got a power room, it's got a bathroom. It's even"
1065,got cloisters. 
1066,MONARCH: Cloisters? 
1067,"ENLIGHTENMENT: A covered walkway, your Majesty. An architectural"
1068,feature of ecclesiastical and educational establishments on Earth. 
1069,MONARCH: All that inside this Tardis? 
1070,"ADRIC: Yes, your Majesty. "
1071,MONARCH: Fascinating. I should love to see all this. 
1072,"ADRIC: Well, I'm quite sure the Doctor would be only too pleased to"
1073,show you around. He's the only one of us who really understands it and
1074,how it operates. 
1075,"MONARCH: Oh, I like that. Could you ask this Doctor now if I could look"
1076,inside his Tardis? 
1077,"ADRIC: Of course, your Majesty. "
1078,(Adric leaves and Nyssa follows.) 
1079,"MONARCH: Not you. Stop her. I have other plans for you, child. "
1080,NYSSA: What are you going to do? 
1081,MONARCH: Don't be afraid. One only harms that which one fears. 
1082, [Guest quarters] 
1083," BIGON: He must be stopped at all costs, Doctor. "
1084,"DOCTOR: If you feel this way, why have you not acted before? "
1085,"BIGON: I am powerless alone. I have free will, but built into my"
1086,circuits is a fail-safe mechanism. Any aggressive intent is immediately
1087,signalled and baulked. 
1088,"DOCTOR: Well, the only course of action I can think of is to go along"
1089,with him. Appear to cooperate. 
1090,BIGON: There may not be time. Sooner or later he is bound to make you
1091,as I am. All of you. 
1092,TEGAN: No! Kill us? 
1093,BIGON: It is not death. First you are hypnotised. Under hypnosis you
1094,are made to recall your whole life. This is recorded and micro-chipped.
1095,Your body is then disposed of and you are remade as I. 
1096,"TEGAN: No, no, no, no, no! "
1097,"DOCTOR: It's all right, it's all right. Just leave everything to me. "
1098,TEGAN: I'm sick of leaving everything to you! 
1099,DOCTOR: Could you perhaps show me the part of the ship that controls
1100,the population? All the information you can. 
1101,"BIGON: Yes, but we must hurry. "
1102,TEGAN: You must be mad. 
1103,DOCTOR: Just keep calm. 
1104,TEGAN: How? We've got to get out of here. We've got to get to the
1105,Tardis and get out of here! 
1106,"DOCTOR: Not yet. Please, will you stop thinking of yourself for once! "
1107,TEGAN: I'm not thinking of myself. We've got to get to Earth and warn
1108,them! 
1109,DOCTOR: Of what? Who'll believe us? We'll be laughed at. 
1110,TEGAN: We can try. 
1111,"DOCTOR: Yes, another way. "
1112,BIGON: Doctor? 
1113,"DOCTOR: Yes, just coming. Now stay here. You'll be perfectly safe. I"
1114,won't be very long. 
1115,TEGAN: I won't stay here! 
1116,"DOCTOR: Yes, you will! In here you can't be seen, out there you can."
1117,You stay here! (to Bigon) Go a little in front of me. That will tell
1118,them not to confront me and I can surprise it. 
1119,"TEGAN: Don't leave me, please. "
1120,DOCTOR: Shush. 
1121,(He turns off the audio interference and takes out the sonic
1122,screwdriver.) 
1123, [Linkway] 
1124," (The Doctor uses the screwdriver on a monopticon,"
1125,which starts spinning in mid-air.) 
1126,BIGON: You reversed the magnetic field? 
1127,"DOCTOR: Yes, and that's the way we'll deal with them all. Come on. "
1128,BIGON: (re helmet) You'd better put that on. 
1129, [Throne room] 
1130, (Enlightenment and Nyssa are staring at each
1131,other.) 
1132,"ENLIGHTENMENT: Your eyes are getting heavy. They are getting heavier,"
1133,"and heavier, and heavier. "
1134,(Nyssa closes her eyes.) 
1135,ENLIGHTENMENT: Now you are asleep. Soon you will recall all past life
1136,and then you will be relieved of the flesh time. Take her to the
1137,Mobiliary. 
1138,(The hoplites lead Nyssa away.) 
1139,PERSUASION: The monopticon in linkway seven has a fault. 
1140,ENLIGHTENMENT: The magnetic field has reversed. 
1141,MONARCH: Then it's the Doctor who's reversed it. He'll be dealt with.
1142,They will all be dealt with. My patience is not inexhaustible. 
1143,"(While Tegan searches the guest quarters for another way out, and Nyssa"
1144,"is escorted down a Linkway, the Doctor opens the door to where the"
1145,Greeks are working and rolls in his cricket ball. While the monopticon
1146,"is distracted by it, he runs in and reverses its magnetic field with"
1147,"the screwdriver, then retrieves the ball.) "
1148,MONARCH: Now he's in the library. 
1149,"ENLIGHTENMENT: Much good may it do him, unless Bigon is there. "
1150,"PERSUASION: I've not seen Bigon for some time, your Majesty. "
1151,"MONARCH: It need not concern you, Persuasion. "
1152,ENLIGHTENMENT: The boy appears lost. 
1153,MONARCH: He'll find his way. 
1154, [Library] 
1155, BIGON: You can take that off to conserve it. The
1156,life support system is on. That red light indicates it. 
1157,(The Doctor removes his helmet.) 
1158,DOCTOR: Is the course controlled from here? 
1159,"BIGON: Yes, but it is an automatic control. "
1160,DOCTOR: What are these doing? 
1161,BIGON: What they have been doing for centuries. Attempting to find
1162,power formulae to move faster than the speed of light. And having some
1163,success. Perhaps a thousand years hence Monarch will indeed be going
1164,"backward in time to a rendezvous with himself, the Creator. "
1165, [Mobiliary] 
1166, (Lin Futu is waiting when the hoplites enter with
1167,Nyssa.) 
1168,LIN FUTU: Leave her. 
1169,(The hoplites leave and two Chinamen take Nyssa's arms. They lead her
1170,to a cubicle where they stand her and put a metal helmet over her head.
1171,Then they shut the transparent door and a light comes on.) 
1172,LIN FUTU: Five minutes. 
1173, [Guest quarters] 
1174," (Adric enters, and Tegan pops up from her hiding"
1175,place.) 
1176,"ADRIC: Tegan, where's the Doctor? "
1177,TEGAN: I don't know. 
1178,ADRIC: What's the matter? 
1179,TEGAN: We've got to get off this ship. We must or we'll all die. 
1180,ADRIC: What utter rubbish! Monarch has no reason for harming us. He
1181,"wants our help. Tegan, the Doctor was right about these Urbankans."
1182,They're light years ahead in their technology. 
1183,"TEGAN: Oh, silicon chips! "
1184,ADRIC: You know? 
1185,"TEGAN: Yeah, and a lot more than you. Now out of my way. "
1186,ADRIC: Where do you think you're going? 
1187,TEGAN: To the Tardis. 
1188,ADRIC: Why? 
1189,TEGAN: To try to get out of here. Somebody's got to. 
1190,"ADRIC: You're being very silly, and anyway, you can't even work it. "
1191,"TEGAN: Well, I'm going to try. "
1192,"ADRIC: But I don't see what you're in such a state about. Look, can't"
1193,you understand? These Urbankans are benefactors. 
1194,TEGAN: Ha! 
1195,ADRIC: And Monarch is charming. He's just asked me very politely if he
1196,could have a look round the Tardis. 
1197,"TEGAN: Adric, you can come with me or get out of my way. What's it"
1198,going to be? 
1199,"ADRIC: But everything is all right, I tell you! And anyway, you can't"
1200,get into the Tardis. 
1201,"TEGAN: Oh, can't I? "
1202,(She pulls the spare key from her jacket pocket.) 
1203,"TEGAN: You forget, I was given this when we left it. "
1204,"ADRIC: Well, I'll take that. "
1205,"TEGAN: You will not! Adric, I'm warning you. Get out of my way! "
1206,"ADRIC: No! Now look, I'm not going to let you do anything silly. "
1207,"(Adric makes a grab for Tegan. She twists out of his grasp and leaves,"
1208,not realising that he has fallen and hit his head against one of the
1209,beds.) 
1210, [Mobiliary] 
1211, (Lin Futu checks on Nyssa's progress.) 
1212,LIN FUTU: Two minutes. 
1213,(Bigon enters the Flora chamber at the top of the stairs. The Doctor
1214,comes in behind and sets the monopticon spinning.) 
1215, [Throne room] 
1216, (Another monitor goes crazy.) 
1217,"PERSUASION: He's now in the Flora chamber, and I saw Bigon with him. "
1218,"MONARCH: As he was in the library. Your eyes have been elsewhere,"
1219,Persuasion. Our friend Bigon is giving the Doctor a guided tour. 
1220,"PERSUASION: Is that wise, your Majesty? "
1221,"MONARCH: Oh, my other minister questions my wisdom. "
1222,PERSUASION: I beg your Majesty's pardon. 
1223,"MONARCH: I should think so, indeed. "
1224, [Flora chamber] 
1225, DOCTOR: Intensified ultraviolet for
1226,photosynthesis. 
1227,"BIGON: Yes, this is all that was saved from Urbanka. "
1228,DOCTOR: And now it's a source of oxygen. 
1229,BIGON: For those who need it. 
1230,DOCTOR: Point taken. 
1231,BIGON: And this is the graveyard of all those taken from Earth. 
1232,DOCTOR: There were others? 
1233,"BIGON: Many. After the experiments, only the highest intelligence was"
1234,"allowed to live on, as I. "
1235,DOCTOR: And the frogs? 
1236,BIGON: To ensure a supply of the poison with which Monarch will conquer
1237,Earth. 
1238,(The Doctor gazes at a tiny tree-frog clinging to the side of a
1239,vivarium.) 
1240, [Throne room] 
1241," (On a monitor, Tegan runs in and unlocks the"
1242,Tardis.) 
1243,MONARCH: The girl Tegan. 
1244,(Tegan goes inside the Tardis.) 
1245,"PERSUASION: Action, your Majesty? "
1246,MONARCH: None. She can do nothing. No Earthling could possibly have the
1247,"capacity. (Tegan locks the doors, hangs up her helmet then starts"
1248,operating controls.) 
1249,MONARCH: The guided tour continues. 
1250,ENLIGHTENMENT: They are now in the Mobiliary. 
1251,"PERSUASION: The girl Nyssa is there in the first stage, your Majesty. "
1252, [Mobiliary] 
1253, LIN FUTU: What did you do to the monopticon? 
1254,BIGON: The Doctor was trying a small experiment. No harm has been done.
1255,Monarch commanded me to show the Doctor the ship. I hope we do not
1256,intrude. 
1257,LIN FUTU: No. If you will allow me to continue with my work? 
1258,BIGON: Of course. 
1259,(Lin Futu moves away. Bigon takes the Doctor to the couch.) 
1260,BIGON: This is where the metamorphoses are performed with him in
1261,"charge. Here in these drawers lie the Urbankans, the future inhabitants"
1262,of Earth. 
1263,DOCTOR: An appalling thought. 
1264,(Lin Futu is listening to them.) 
1265,BIGON: All must be destroyed. 
1266,DOCTOR: It's a tall order. 
1267,(Bigon looks in a drawer.) 
1268,BIGON: This was once my prison for over a hundred years. The penalty
1269,for my one and only attempt at revolt. 
1270,(Bigon leads the Doctor over to an octagonal unit in the middle of the
1271,room.) 
1272,BIGON: Here is the poison. 
1273,"(In the Tardis, Tegan is failing to make the Tardis do anything except"
1274,make noises.) 
1275,BIGON: This is how the process works. The subject is hypnotised and
1276,their memory recorded. The subject is then terminated and their body
1277,used to fertilise the Flora chamber. By Zeus! One of you is already in
1278,there! 
1279,(Bigon and the Doctor dash over to the cabinet and open the door. The
1280,light goes off and Bigon removes the helmet from Nyssa before they drag
1281,her out.) 
1282,"DOCTOR: Nyssa, wake up. "
1283,(Nyssa's eyes open and she falls into the Doctor's arms. He carries her
1284,over to the couch and sits her down.) 
1285,"NYSSA: Oh, Doctor, thank you. "
1286,DOCTOR: Are you all right? 
1287,NYSSA: I'll be all right in a minute. They were going to kill me. 
1288,"DOCTOR: Yes, the devils. Where's Adric? "
1289,NYSSA: I think he's all right. They sent him to look for you. They want
1290,the key to the Tardis. 
1291,"DOCTOR: Oh, do they. "
1292,(Adric wakes with a sore head and stumbles out of the guest quarters
1293,without his helmet. 
1294,(Tegan tries everything except sweet talk and a box of chocolates to
1295,get the Tardis to work.) 
1296, [Throne room] 
1297," LIN FUTU: Your Majesty, they were plotting the"
1298,deliberate destruction of the Urbankan people. 
1299,MONARCH: You've done well. Bigon will be de-circuited and the Doctor
1300,"destroyed. Persuasion, see to it. "
1301,PERSUASION: Your Majesty. 
1302,(Persuasion and Lin Futu leave.) 
1303,MONARCH: So perish all who threaten my mission. 
1304, [Tardis] 
1305, (Tegan is close to tears of frustration.) 
1306,TEGAN: Come on. 
1307, [Mobiliary] 
1308," DOCTOR: Could we expect support from the others,"
1309,Kurkutji and Futu? 
1310,"BIGON: No, they have been corrupted by power. They have been promised,"
1311,"as I was, dominion over their ethnic groups on Earth. "
1312,"DOCTOR: Yes, difficult to resist. "
1313,"BIGON: Not for me. In a civilised world, there is no substitute for"
1314,democracy. 
1315,DOCTOR: Is there nowhere we could hide ourselves to get a plan
1316,together? 
1317,BIGON: Nowhere. 
1318,DOCTOR: No weapons? 
1319,BIGON: The armoury is in the throne room. 
1320,DOCTOR: Then our only hope is to get to the Tardis and warn Earth.
1321,Might these be of any use to us? 
1322,(The Chinamen.) 
1323,BIGON: Not as they are. Perhaps I could alter their circuits. 
1324,"NYSSA: Doctor, may I have your sonic screwdriver? "
1325,DOCTOR: What for? 
1326,"NYSSA: I'd like to try something. This has an electric charge, hasn't"
1327,it? 
1328,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1329,"NYSSA: Now, may I borrow your pencil? "
1330,(The Doctor hands over the pencil as Adric bursts in.) 
1331,"ADRIC: Doctor! Doctor, it's Tegan. She's trying to move the Tardis. "
1332,"DOCTOR: Oh, good grief. "
1333,(Persuasion enters with a two hoplites and Lin Futu.) 
1334,PERSUASION: Take them! 
1335,(Two Chinamen seize Bigon.) 
1336,"DOCTOR: Ah, yes, I "
1337,(Two more Chinamen twist the Doctor's arms behind his back. 
1338,Tegan finally gets the time rotor going up and down.) 
1339, [Throne room] 
1340, (Enlightenment and Monarch watch the Tardis
1341,dematerialise on the monitor.) 
1342,MONARCH: So it goes. So any fool can operate it. So much for the
1343,Doctor's technology. So be it. 
1344, [Mobiliary] 
1345, (Persuasion restores the monopticon's magnetic
1346,field.) 
1347,PERSUASION: De-circuit that. 
1348,(Bigon is led away.) 
1349,PERSUASION: And kill him. 
1350,"(A Chinaman kicks the back of the Doctor's leg, forcing him to kneel.) "
1351,ADRIC: No! No! No! No! 
1352,(A hoplite prepares to behead the Doctor.) 
1353, Part Four
1354,
1355, [Mobiliary] 
1356, (Nyssa quickly reaches up to the executioner's
1357,disc and touches it with both the screwdriver and pencil. There is a
1358,quick crackle of electricity and he freezes. She does the same to the
1359,one holding Adric. Persuasion takes out a small hand weapon and points
1360,it at the Doctor. Adric runs forward between them.) 
1361,ADRIC: No! 
1362, [Throne room] 
1363, MONARCH: Do not harm the boy. 
1364,(The monopticon relays the instruction.) 
1365,MONARCH: The boy has great courage. 
1366,"ENLIGHTENMENT: And the girl, your Majesty, has Urbankan intelligence. "
1367,"MONARCH: Yes, the graphite of the pencil conducted the power of the"
1368,sonic device causing a short circuit. 
1369,ENLIGHTENMENT: Precisely. 
1370, [Mobiliary] 
1371," ADRIC: If you can hear me, your Majesty? "
1372, [Throne room] 
1373," MONARCH: I hear you, my boy. "
1374,"ADRIC : With respect, I cannot join you if any harm is done"
1375,to the Doctor. 
1376,"MONARCH: Persuasion, stay the execution. Bring them all to me. But"
1377,"first, confiscate the Doctor's sonic device. "
1378, [Mobiliary] 
1379," PERSUASION: That instrumentation, please. "
1380,(Nyssa hands them over.) 
1381,PERSUASION: You may keep the pencil. Release him. You will turn out
1382,"your pockets, Doctor. "
1383,"DOCTOR: I think I will, yes. "
1384,(A Chinaman holds out his arms for the contents of the coat of many
1385,"pockets. A notebook, some string, a magnifying glass and the cricket"
1386,ball. The other Chinaman frisks him to make sure nothing has been
1387,"missed, then Nyssa returns the pencil.) "
1388,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you, Nyssa. It was brilliant, by the way. Quite"
1389,brilliant. 
1390,(Persuasion holds up the magnifying glass.) 
1391,PERSUASION: What is this? 
1392,DOCTOR: Eye glass. I'm a bit short-sighted in this one. 
1393,(He indicates his right eye.) 
1394,PERSUASION: This? 
1395,DOCTOR: It's a piece of string. 
1396,PERSUASION: And this? 
1397,DOCTOR: It's a cricket ball. A memento. I used to bowl a very good
1398,chinaman. 
1399,"(He looks one of the Chinamen in the eye, guiltily. A chinaman in"
1400,cricket is a left-handed googly. A googly is a right-handed delivery
1401,"that breaks opposite to normal, from off to leg.... oh, go and look the"
1402,terms up on a search engine if you want.) 
1403,DOCTOR: I took five wickets once for New South Wales. 
1404,PERSUASION: His Majesty wishes to see you. All of you. 
1405,(The Doctor's possessions are returned to him. Lin Futu enters.) 
1406,"PERSUASION: Replace their motor circuits. Precede me, please. "
1407,"(The Doctor, Nyssa and Adric leave with Persuasion's weapon at their"
1408,backs. Bigon is helped up from the couch and let away. He is staring at
1409,nothing.) 
1410, [Tardis] 
1411, (Tegan activates the scanner to see where she has
1412,taken the Tardis. The Urbankan spaceship is nearby.) 
1413,TEGAN: Oh cripes. 
1414,(The time rotor is still going slowly up and down.) 
1415,"TEGAN: No. No, leave well alone. "
1416, [Linkway] 
1417, (The Doctor looks out of a porthole at the
1418,Tardis.) 
1419,"PERSUASION: Yes, Doctor, the poor are always with us, but I would"
1420,prefer not to keep his Majesty waiting. 
1421,"(Paraphrasing Matthew 26:11, Christian Bible New Testament.) "
1422, [Throne room] 
1423," MONARCH: Ah, Doctor. Your machine is reluctant to"
1424,break free from mine. 
1425,DOCTOR: I can't think why. 
1426,"MONARCH: A more considerate guest than you, perhaps. "
1427,"DOCTOR: Oh, is it usual for a host to kill a guest? "
1428,"MONARCH: Oh, in certain rarified circles, but your life is forfeit"
1429,because you were plotting against me. 
1430,ADRIC: Doctor? 
1431,DOCTOR: My actions were motivated by scientific curiosity. 
1432,MONARCH: Not as they were reported to me. 
1433,"DOCTOR: Reports can be garbled, your Majesty. "
1434,MONARCH: Not this time. Was it scientific curiosity which caused you to
1435,interfere with my monopticons? 
1436,DOCTOR: I wouldn't dream of interfering with your monopticons. 
1437,MONARCH: Enough of these recriminations. I propose to show my moral
1438,"superiority by sparing your life. I'm not, as you would have others"
1439,"believe, a wanton destroyer, but I must protect myself and my mission."
1440,"Now the girl Nyssa will be held hostage. If you're restrained, you'll"
1441,come to no harm. Beware you're not the cause of her destruction. Take
1442,her to Lin Futu. Let him sedate her and await my orders. 
1443,(Nyssa and Persuasion leave.) 
1444,"MONARCH: Control, let there be a recreational. For while my eyes are"
1445,"restored from the results of the Doctor's scientific curiosity, I would"
1446,have my family under my benevolent gaze. You have my permission to
1447,withdraw. 
1448,"DOCTOR: Thank you, your Majesty. "
1449,(The Doctor and Adric leave.) 
1450,MONARCH: The boy Adric cannot fail to be with me now. 
1451, [Tardis] 
1452, [Tegan has got out the Tardis Type 40 Handbook.) 
1453,TEGAN: Pommie mumbo jumbo. 
1454, [Throne room] 
1455, (In the recreation room we are treated to the
1456,"aboriginal dance. Bigon sits on the ground floor, blank. Persuasion"
1457,returns to the throne room where we can hear the didgeridoo.) 
1458,"PERSUASION: The girl Nyssa is secured and sedated, your Majesty. "
1459,MONARCH: Good. Where are the Doctor and the boy? 
1460,(The monitor scans the recreation room.) 
1461,"MONARCH: Ah, Bigon is there. "
1462,PERSUASION: He should have been de-circuited centuries ago. I will go
1463,"seek the Doctor and the boy, your Majesty. "
1464, [Guest quarters] 
1465," DOCTOR: Adric, I'm sorry. I really am. "
1466,"ADRIC: Well, that's all right. And nothing will happen to Nyssa as long"
1467,as you 
1468,"DOCTOR: I know, I know, and that's what I'm sorry about. You know, I"
1469,think I may have been entirely mistaken about Monarch. 
1470,ADRIC: What? 
1471, [Throne room] 
1472, (The monopticon's view is still blocked by the
1473,"Doctor's hat, but the sound comes through loud and clear.) "
1474,ADRIC : I'm so glad to hear you say that. 
1475,"DOCTOR : Oh, he's an autocrat, of course, but I now believe a"
1476,benevolent one. 
1477,"ADRIC : He is, yes. "
1478,DOCTOR : And he's ruthless. Anyone can see that. 
1479, [Guest quarters] 
1480, DOCTOR: All great leaders have to be ruthless.
1481,"It's the intention, the mission "
1482, [Throne room] 
1483, DOCTOR : The sheer 
1484,(The Doctor takes his hat off the monopticon.) 
1485,"DOCTOR : Breadth of vision, that's the important thing. "
1486,"ADRIC : Well, yes, isn't it. "
1487,"DOCTOR : I mean, he could quite easily have had me killed."
1488,Now why didn't he? 
1489,ADRIC : Exactly what I've been trying to tell you. 
1490,"DOCTOR : I know, and that's what I'm sorry about. That's"
1491,"why at the earliest opportunity I shall request permission to see him,"
1492,seek an audience and make my peace with him. 
1493, [Guest quarters] 
1494," DOCTOR: Come on, let's go and see a bit of the"
1495,recreational. 
1496,ADRIC: All right. 
1497, [Recreation space] 
1498, (The Doctor and Adric enter behind the mock hunt.
1499,Persuasion takes up his place of honour at the other end of the area
1500,and keeps his eyes locked on the Doctor and Adric as they go up the
1501,steps to the balcony.) 
1502,"DOCTOR: Now listen to me, you young idiot. You're not so much gullible"
1503,as idealistic. I suppose it comes from your deprived delinquent
1504,background. Monarch is the greatest being in the known universe for
1505,evil. He will destroy Earth and much more if he's not stopped. 
1506,ADRIC: Back there you said 
1507,"DOCTOR: Yes, back there he could hear us. Here he can't. I'm playing"
1508,for time. 
1509,"ADRIC: But you're wrong, Doctor. He's civilised "
1510,DOCTOR: Do you want to save Nyssa? 
1511,ADRIC: Of course I do. 
1512,DOCTOR: Then shut up and listen. He is not concerned with bringing
1513,civilisation. He has the greatest contempt for anyone but himself. He
1514,wants to rob Earth of its minerals in order to travel faster than the
1515,speed of light. 
1516,(The music stops and applause breaks out. Villagra summons her Mayan
1517,dancing women.) 
1518,"DOCTOR: All right, all right, if that doesn't convince you, why does he"
1519,carry poison on his ship? 
1520,ADRIC: Poison? 
1521,"DOCTOR: It's stored in the Mobiliary. If his mission is peaceful, why"
1522,does he want the poison? 
1523,"ADRIC: Well, history, research. "
1524,DOCTOR: Do you really think that? 
1525,ADRIC: He could have had you killed and yet he spared your life. Why? 
1526,DOCTOR: Because he doesn't want to upset you yet. 
1527,ADRIC: I don't believe you. 
1528,"DOCTOR: Look, he wants to use you. His subjects are all synthetic. You"
1529,"are flesh and blood. If you speak up for him on Earth, you can delay"
1530,their opposition. 
1531,ADRIC: I still don't understand. 
1532,"DOCTOR: No, you don't, do you. Look, the Urbankans are synthetic. They"
1533,"are not like you and me. However sophisticated their circuitry, they"
1534,are still machines. With me? 
1535,ADRIC: I think so. 
1536,"DOCTOR: Well, make up your mind. We haven't much time. "
1537,"ADRIC: Why, what are you going to do? "
1538,DOCTOR: I haven't the slightest intention of telling you until I know
1539,if you're with me. 
1540,"ADRIC: Yes. All right then, yes. "
1541,DOCTOR: I don't believe it. 
1542,(The Doctor stands and yawns. He gestures to Adric to get up too.) 
1543, [Throne room] 
1544, MONARCH: The Doctor is tired. A prime disadvantage
1545,of the flesh time. 
1546,"(In the Tardis, Tegan turns on the scanner again to see she hasn't"
1547,"moved, then throws the Handbook on the floor and stamps on it.) "
1548, [Linkway] 
1549, (The monopticon here is still spinning.) 
1550,"DOCTOR: That's good. With any luck, they haven't put this one right"
1551,yet. 
1552,ADRIC: What are you going to do? 
1553,DOCTOR: Get some allies. This door leads to the Mobiliary. Nyssa's in
1554,"here. Now, with this (magnifying glass) I can distract the monopticon"
1555,without disabling it. It won't scan us but neither will it draw
1556,attention to us. Be ready to take over from me when we get inside. 
1557, [Mobiliary] 
1558, (The Doctor holds the glass up in front of the
1559,monopticon's 'eye'.) 
1560,"DOCTOR: Now, it's important to hold it steady. It has a cobalt ring"
1561,with a high flux density. 
1562,ADRIC: Right. 
1563,(Adric takes the magnifying glass while the Doctor goes to the drawers
1564,of personalities. He takes out a small box.) 
1565,LIN FUTU: What are you doing here? 
1566,"DOCTOR: Saving your life, I hope. "
1567,LIN FUTU: Seize him! 
1568,"DOCTOR: No! No, hear me out. You are in great danger. "
1569, [Throne room] 
1570, (Persuasion enters.) 
1571,"PERSUASION: Everything is in order, your Majesty. "
1572,"MONARCH: Yes, I saw our friend retire. Mobiliary, why have you changed"
1573,your scan? 
1574,(The monitor has concentric circles radiating across it.) 
1575,"MONARCH: Control, report on that monopticon. "
1576,CONTROL: Cobalt high flux density present. 
1577,MONARCH: Don't say that Doctor's on the prowl again. What a pest!
1578,Persuasion! 
1579, [Mobiliary] 
1580, DOCTOR: You must know all I say is true. Put them
1581,back. Bigon must have them back. 
1582,LIN FUTU: You know I cannot do this. 
1583,"DOCTOR: You must. Lin Futu, you are a very old and wise man. You have"
1584,been promised leadership of your people on Earth. 
1585,LIN FUTU: Yes. 
1586,DOCTOR: Do you think for one moment that Monarch will honour that? The
1587,Chinese are the most populous and powerful race on Earth. Once Monarch
1588,"grasps that, what hope is there for you? "
1589,(Monarch is happily watching the Mayan dance on the Recreational
1590,monitor.) 
1591,LIN FUTU: How can I re-circuit Bigon without Monarch knowing? 
1592,DOCTOR: Leave that to me. Will your dragon dance be included in the
1593,recreational? 
1594,LIN FUTU: It can be. 
1595,DOCTOR: Then let it be next. 
1596,(Lin Futu smiles and takes Bigon's personality box. The Doctor takes
1597,"over the magnifying glass from Adric, who runs out of the room. The"
1598,"Doctor follows. In the recreational, the Mayan dance finishes and the"
1599,"Chinese dragons enter. So do the Doctor and Adric, and Persuasion, who"
1600,leaves again almost immediately. The Doctor and Adric sit near Bigon.
1601,The Doctor waves at the monopticon.) 
1602, [Throne room] 
1603," MONARCH: Ah, conformity. There is no other"
1604,freedom. 
1605, [Tardis] 
1606, TEGAN: What have I got to lose? 
1607,(She presses buttons.) 
1608, [Mobiliary] 
1609, (The dragon dancers leave the recreational. The
1610,"second one has gained six extra legs. In the Throne room, we see that"
1611,the recreational has moved on to Greek wrestling. The dragons return to
1612,"the Mobiliary and the Doctor, and Adric and Bigon get out from under"
1613,the dragon's body. The Doctor and Lin Futu lie Bigon down on the couch
1614,while Adric holds the magnifying glass up to the monopticon. The Doctor
1615,"goes to Nyssa, who is lying on a second couch.) "
1616,"DOCTOR: Wake up, Nyssa. Nyssa! Nyssa! "
1617,"(He shakes her awake. A few minutes later, Bigon's personality is back"
1618,in his body. A Chinaman has taken over monopticon duty.) 
1619,BIGON: Thank you. I am very glad that you are with us. 
1620,DOCTOR: What about the Princess and Kurkutji? 
1621,BIGON: They too will be with us when they hear the truth. I will summon
1622,them. 
1623,ADRIC: What are we going to do? 
1624,"DOCTOR: Well, somehow I must get to the Tardis. There are hatches. I"
1625,must try to get to it on a lifeline. 
1626,BIGON: Hatch nine is nearest. 
1627,LIN FUTU: You will need life support and protective covering. 
1628,ADRIC: We have this. 
1629,(A helmet.) 
1630,"DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, that won't do for the temperature out there."
1631,"And anyway, I'll need your help. "
1632,(Lin Futu brings a silver spacesuit.) 
1633,LIN FUTU: Here. Used for repairs and maintenance topsides. Our
1634,lubrication freezes and our joints seize up. 
1635,"DOCTOR: Splendid. Adric. I can use this, (the helmet) but we have only"
1636,six minutes. That's as long as I can stand sub-zero temperatures. 
1637, [Throne room] 
1638, MONARCH: The Doctor and the boy Adric are
1639,conspicuous by their absence. To say nothing of Bigon! 
1640, [Mobiliary] 
1641, (Adric is suited up. He looks like a slim
1642,Sontaran.) 
1643,DOCTOR: What about the androids? Have you control of them all? 
1644,"BIGON: Yes, but Monarch or one of his ministers can countermand any"
1645,order. 
1646,"DOCTOR: Well, is there no way to break the contact? "
1647,BIGON: Only by de-circuiting them. 
1648,(Villagra and Kurkutji enter. Lin Futu goes to greet them.) 
1649,"DOCTOR: No, there's no time. Anyway, you'd be seen. "
1650,BIGON: Wait. There is a way. There is a fail-safe mechanism. A faulty
1651,"circuit once gave rise to development of reason, a potential for"
1652,revolt. Any collective activity automatically jams the androids'
1653,"circuits. Nyssa, relieve him. "
1654,(Nyssa takes over magnifying glass duty.) 
1655,DOCTOR: Can you arrange a collective activity? 
1656,BIGON: I do not see why one thing should not lead to another. 
1657, [Throne room] 
1658," (In the recreational, the Greek wrestlers give way"
1659,"to the hoplites, while the Mayans, the Chinese and aboriginals also to"
1660,take the floor at the same time.) 
1661,"MONARCH: What is going on? Control, let it cease. "
1662,CONTROL: Cessation not possible. Motor circuits jammed on common
1663,activity. 
1664,MONARCH: What was designed as a fail-safe has been turned against me.
1665,The Doctor is behind this. Kill the girl Nyssa. Find the Doctor.
1666,Destroy him! Persuasion! 
1667, [Hatch nine] 
1668, (Adric holds up the magnifying glass to the
1669,monopticon on duty as the outer hatch opens. The Doctor lashes himself
1670,to a stanchion with a bright orange rope and jumps out into space.
1671,Adric makes sure the rope plays out properly as the Doctor tries to
1672,'swim' to the Tardis. The rope is too short and he has to turn back.
1673,"Persuasion enters and fires his weapon, narrowly missing Adric, who"
1674,"falls. For some reason, Persuasion trips and falls. Adric gets his"
1675,"weapon and uses it, but it has no effect on the android. Adric and"
1676,Persuasion grapple with each other as the Doctor pulls himself back to
1677,the spaceship.) 
1678, [Throne room] 
1679, MONARCH: The boy has betrayed me. 
1680,(The Doctor returns to the ship and grabs Persuasion by the neck.) 
1681,MONARCH: Help him! 
1682,(Enlightenment leaves. The Doctor pulls out Persuasion's personality
1683,chip and throws it into space.) 
1684,MONARCH: No! 
1685, [Hatch nine] 
1686, (The Doctor retrieves his sonic screwdriver from
1687,"Persuasion's pocket, give Adric the thumbs up and launches himself into"
1688,"space again. Once again Adric blinds the monopticon. Also again, the"
1689,Doctor can't quite reach the Tardis and turns back. Enlightenment
1690,"enters and shoots Adric in the back. He falls over. In mid-space, the"
1691,Doctor watches Enlightenment untie his lifeline and throw it out to
1692,him.)

1695,nowhere.

1697,is about to fire he kicks at her legs. The blast knocks out the
1698,monopticon instead.) 
1699,"MONARCH: Report, Enlightenment. "
1700,(Adric removes Enlightenment's circuit and throws it out of the ship.) 
1701,"MONARCH: Report, Enlightenment! Report! "

1704,porthole.) 
1705,LIN FUTU: We must get a line to him. 
1706,BIGON: Too late. His six minutes are almost up. 
1707,(The Doctor unties himself and gets out his cricket ball. He throws it
1708,"straight at the spaceship and catches the rebound, whose momentum"
1709,pushes him back towards the Tardis door. Adric does a happy jig and the
1710,androids cheer as the Doctor unlocks the Tardis and goes inside.)

1717,(The Doctor works the Tardis controls.) 
1718,"DOCTOR: You're spoiling my concentration. Come on, old girl. Just don't"
1719,let me down now. Don't let me down now.

1721,dancers as the Tardis materialises.)

1724,"DOCTOR: Rescuing Nyssa and Adric. Look, just do what I say and do it"

1744,NYSSA: Adric. 
1745,ADRIC: What? 
1746,NYSSA: My oxygen's running out. 
1747,ADRIC: Then don't talk and keep still. 
1748, [Throne room] 
1749, MONARCH: Now all I have to do is wait. And that is
1750,"something I do very, very well indeed. "
1751, [Mobiliary] 
1752, (Lin Futu gets the visor refitted and they put the
1753,collar and helmet onto the gasping Doctor.) 
1754,DOCTOR: Thank you. Bigon? 
1755,BIGON: What? 
1756,DOCTOR: Can you change the course of this ship? 
1757,BIGON: To where? 
1758,DOCTOR: Urbanka. 
1759,(The Doctor removes the phial from the venom store.) 
1760,"DOCTOR: Monarch's poison, the last dangerous thing on this ship. Be"
1761,very careful with it. I want to analyse it. 
1762,(He hands it to Adric.) 
1763,ADRIC: Right. 
1764,(The Doctor turns to the monopticon and waves.) 
1765,DOCTOR: I'd go home if I were you. 
1766, [Throne room] 
1767, DOCTOR : You don't stand an earthly
1768,where we're going. 
1769,(The Doctor puts his thumbs to his ears and waggles his fingers. He
1770,"probably stuck his tongue out, too.) "
1771,"MONARCH: Confound you! Control, release full life support systems. "
1772, [Mobiliary] 
1773," DOCTOR: Well, come on, come on. I'm taking you"
1774,back to Earth. 
1775, [Recreation space] 
1776, (Monarch stands in front of the Tardis brandishing
1777,a weapon.) 
1778,"MONARCH: No, Doctor. "
1779,"(The Doctor throws the phial of poison at Monarch, who screams and"
1780,shrinks rapidly. The Doctor removes his helmet.) 
1781,BIGON: Doctor. 
1782,"DOCTOR: Oh, it's quite all right. He needs the atmosphere as much as we"
1783,do. 
1784,(The Doctor puts his helmet over the tiny Monarch.) 
1785,DOCTOR: Hence the Flora chamber. 
1786,NYSSA: You mean he's still in flesh time? 
1787,"DOCTOR: Partly, anyway. The poison only works on organic matter. "
1788,NYSSA: Of course. 
1789,"DOCTOR: You know, I had my doubts about anyone who wants to go"
1790,backwards in time by travelling faster than the speed of light. It's
1791,impossible. Fallacy of flesh time. 
1792,"TEGAN: Can we go now, Doctor? "
1793,"DOCTOR: Yes, all right. (to Bigon) Are you coming? "
1794,BIGON: No. I think we'll go on to another planet and try and start
1795,again. 
1796,DOCTOR: Good luck. 
1797,(The four flesh beings enter the Tardis. It dematerialises.) 
1798, [Tardis] 
1799, DOCTOR: I suppose it would have been a bit
1800,difficult placing Bigon and the others. 
1801,"TEGAN: Oh, I don't know. They wouldn't have looked a bit out of place"
1802,in Terminal three. 
1803,"DOCTOR: Heathrow, here we come. "
1804,TEGAN: I've heard that before. 
1805,ADRIC: Except Nyssa never repaired the time curve indicator. 
1806,"NYSSA: Doctor, I "
1807,(Nyssa collapses.) 
1808,DOCTOR: Nyssa?
