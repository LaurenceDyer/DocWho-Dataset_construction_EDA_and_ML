22,"(Clara runs through the door, followed by the Doctor, who closes it on the bright yellow light outside.)"
23,CLARA: I told you it'd work! 
24,"DOCTOR: It very nearly ate you for dinner. CLARA: Oh, admit it. I totally saved your life. DOCTOR: It wasn't going to eat me. CLARA:"
25, (laughs) I totally saved you from having to marry that giant sentient 
26,plant thing. That bit when I jumped over the side? That was amazing. 
27,(The Doctor snorts and grins.)CLARA: Ha! I knew you were impressed.DOCTOR:
28," The second most beautiful garden in all of time and space, and we can "
29,"never come back here because you, Miss Oswald, decided (The Tardis console phone rings. They stare at it, then the Doctor gestures for Clara to answer it.)CLARA: Hello? RIGSY : Clara? Finally. It's Rigsy.CLARA: Oh. Rigsy. Hey. What's wrong? "
30,
31,[Rigsy's home]
32,"(The lad from Flatline is in front of his bathroom mirror, and worried.)"
33,"RIGSY: So I have this, er, it kind of looks like a tattoo. CLARA : Seriously? I gave you this number for emergencies.RIGSY: It's an emergency, trust me. Just "
34,
35,[Tardis]
36,
37,RIGSY : Come and take a look at it. Please.DOCTOR: Who said you could give out my number? 
38,"CLARA: Look, look, no matter how bad it is, we cannot take you back down your timeline "
39,
40,[Rigsy's home]
41,
42,"CLARA : Just to fix a tattoo. RIGSY: That's just it. I didn't get a tattoo. And it's, it's counting down. "
43,[Tardis]
44,"CLARA: Sorry, what? "
45,[Rigsy's home]
46,
47,"(Rigsy holds a mirror up to the back of his neck to show his tattoo, the numbers 538.)"
48,RIGSY: The tattoo - it's a number and it's counting down to zero. 
49,
50,[Tardis]
51,CLARA: Hang tight. We'll be right there. 
52,[Rigsy's home]
53,
54,RIGSY: Hurry. Please. 
55,(The number changes to 537. 
56,After the title sequence we see a bright light flashing in the window of
57," a seventh floor flat, accompanied by the Tardis materialisation sound. She has parked herself in the baby's bedroom. The"
58," baby herself is lying in a pink cot, and the Doctor is now wearing a burgundy Crombie jacket and"
59," white shirt of the style preferred in the last season, before he went "
60,all rock and roll on us. Everyone is whispering despite the child being wide awake.)DOCTOR: Did you make this human? 
61,"RIGSY: Lucy? Yeah, she's mine. CLARA: Oh. Hello. Oh, Rigsy, she's gorgeous. DOCTOR: She's better than that. She's brilliant. What are you doing running round getting tattoos when there's CLARA: Shh! "
62,"RIGSY: Look, I didn't get anything. I woke up this morning and it was just there. Jen noticed it. DOCTOR: Okay, show me this tattoo that you didn't get, then. "
63,"(Rigsy turns and pulls down the back of his jumper collar.)DOCTOR: It's a tattoo. It's very boring. RIGSY: No, wait. Just, just keep watching. CLARA: What were you doing last night? RIGSY: That's just it. Yesterday was a total blank. Jen said that I left the house "
64,"before dawn, I missed work, and I didn't get back till after midnight. "
65,No one saw me all day. 
66,
67,
68,"(The Doctor has finished flicking through a baby's picture book when the tattoo changes from 533 to 532.)DOCTOR: Oh, that's not boring. That is very not boring. (He puts on his sonic sunglasses.)CLARA: What? What is it? (The Doctor removes his glasses.)"
69,"DOCTOR: Okay, Local Knowledge, you're coming with us. Bring the new "
70,"human. No, don't bring the new human. I'll just get distracted. "
71,
72,[Tardis]
73,"(A golden line is moving down Rigsy, doing a full body scan where he stands.)"
74,"DOCTOR: If you want your extremities to stay attached, stand absolutely still. "
75,"If not, we can provide a small bag, you can take them home at the end."
76,
77,(Clara has Rigsy's smart phone plugged into the console.)
78,"CLARA: Rigsy, your phone. It's like they've wiped it, but only the last "
79,"day. No location data, no texts, nothing. You're sure the screen wasn't "
80,"cracked before yesterday? RIGSY: Mmm hmm. DOCTOR: Oh. Right, okay, here we go. Ah Good. Weird. Good and weird. "
81,(The scanner says the count is 526.)RIGSY: (without moving anything) Can I? DOCTOR:
82," Er, oh, yes, yes. Of course. First off. In the last twenty four hours, "
83,"you have had significant contact with alien lifeforms, right here in the"
84," centre of London. RIGSY: Okay, so why don't I remember anything? DOCTOR: You've been retconned. RIGSY: Huh? "
85,CLARA: What conned? 
86,DOCTOR: Amnesia drug. 
87,(Captain Jack Harkness's favourite drug.)
88,"DOCTOR: Your pre-frontal cortex is marinating in it. Ooo, there's something else. Something. Er, not good. Weird. "
89,(The Doctor walks around the console and picks up his cue cards. The top
90, one reads I Could Be Wrong. Lets Try It Your Way. He goes to the next 
91,card. Clara stares at him.)RIGSY: What's he doing? CLARA: He's making an effort to be nice. DOCTOR: There is no nice way to say you're about to die. RIGSY: What? 
92,"(The Doctor puts down his cards and walks the rest of the way round.)DOCTOR: Rigsy RIGSY: No, no, no, no, no. Don't start using my actual name now. Call me Pudding Brain, call me Local Knowledge. Whatever. "
93,Just don't call me Rigsy. You're going to save me. You're a doctor. That's what you do. 
94,"(The Doctor turns away and thinks about it, then turns back.)DOCTOR:"
95," Okay. Okay. Yes, okay, let's do this thing. First up, stop the "
96,"countdown. Five hundred and twenty six minutes. Right. Okay. Yes, you "
97,"know what, Local Knowledge, I don't know who did this to you or why. But"
98, I do almost certainly know 
99, how to find them.

101,
102,[Outside the British Library]
103,
104,"(The Tardis materialises down a side street. The Doctor, Clara and Rigsy get out.)"
105,"DOCTOR: There have always been rumours, stories passed from traveller to traveller. Mutterings about hidden streets."
106,
107,
108,[British Library]
109,
110,DOCTOR: Secret pockets of alien life right here on Earth. Like a 
111,"smuggler's cove, only not a cove, because it's right here, right in the "
112,middle of the capital. 
113,RIGSY: The hidden places are in the Great British Library?DOCTOR: No. The maps are. 
114,
115,[BN31 Map Room]
116,
117,(No documents to be taken from this room. The Doctor and Rigsy are 
118,unrolling lots of old maps of central London. One is projected onto a 
119,screen on the wall behind them.)
120,DOCTOR: I never put stock in it. London streets that suddenly 
121,"disappeared from human view? No. You lot are always overlooking things, "
122,"but whole streets? That would be excessive, even for you."
123,"If the stories are true, though, there should be a street on one of "
124,"these old maps that no longer exists in the real world. CLARA: Like a trap street, only not. DOCTOR: What did you say? CLARA: A trap street. You know, when someone's making a map, a, er cartographer, uses a fake street, throws it into the mix,"
125,"names it after one of his kids or whatever. Then if the fake street, the trap street, ever shows up on someone else's map,"
126,"they know their work's been stolen. Clever, right? DOCTOR: My God. A whole London street just up and disappeared and you lot assume it's a copyright infringement. RIGSY: So we're looking for a trap street? DOCTOR: We're looking for a trap street and we're not going to find it here. "
127,
128,[Tardis]
129,DOCTOR: The glasses are tracking your eye movements. Just keep looking straight down and 
130,"(Clara is lying down looking out of the open Tardis doorway, wearing the sonic sunglasses.)CLARA: I know! Focus on the buildings directly below me. "
131,"(They are flying along the Thames, from the City to Westminster.)DOCTOR: Whatever they're using, it only hides the street itself. It prevents you from noticing there's even something missing."
132,They're somehow making our eyes skate right over it. Let's call it a misdirection circuit. (The
133," Tardis jolts, and Clara slides half way out of the door, with her knee "
134,and foot latching onto the other door and the door frame to stop her 
135,"from falling all the way out.)RIGSY: Clara! CLARA: (whoops and laughs) Hello, London! (Another jolt slides her back in.)CLARA: (laughing) I'm good. I'm good. RIGSY: She enjoyed that way too much. DOCTOR: Tell me about it. It's an ongoing problem. Here. "
136,(He puts Rigsy's hands on the controls.)
137,DOCTOR: Keep it steady. Just 
138,"move it slowly over the grid. When we're done, we'll have a map"
139,of the areas of the grid that Clara couldn't focus on. 
140,
141,[Pedestrian area]
142,
143,"(Played by Hayes Island, Cardiff. The statue of anti-slavery "
144,campaigner John Batchelor is a bit of a giveaway. Our heroes are looking
145, at a map of London with three areas marked in red.)
146,"CLARA: So, these are the bits my eyes skated over. DOCTOR: Okay, we "
147,"split up. Clara, that way. (she walks off) Local Knowledge. (another "
148,direction)Â  Forget the way you usually look at the world. This 
149,street's going to
150,be hiding in plain sight. 
151,
152,[Various streets]
153,
154,"(As Clara, Rigsy and the Doctor are walking past shops and offices in different locations, but mostly Wharton Street, Cardiff.)"
155,"DOCTOR : If you see something unusual or notable, dismiss it. Just keep walking."
156,But if there's a bit of London so unremarkable that you don't even think about it stop. You could very well be standing
157,right outside a trap street. Count everything that you see. 
158,"CLARA: Four, five, six DOCTOR : Because when you hit the area around a trap street, it's very likely you'll lose count. DOCTOR: Seventy nine, eighty, eighty one, eighty two. "
159,"(The Doctor stops a boy and his mother who are walking along the street, then kneels down to tie the lad's shoelaces up.)BOY: Huh? "
160,DOCTOR: Remember. Eighty two. MOTHER: Come along! 
161,BOY: Eighty two. DOCTOR : You'll lose count because the misdirection circuit is creating confusion in your mind. Details won't add up.
162,Reality will have glitches in it. 
163,"(Clara stops, shakes her head, and walks backwards in front of the Brew Dog Bar in Westgate Street, Cardiff.)"
164,"DOCTOR : Like when you try to read the same simple sentence three times over CLARA: One, two, three. "
165,DOCTOR : And the meaning just won't sink in. CLARA: Gotcha. 
166,[Park Street corner]
167,
168,(Clara is already waiting here as the Doctor approaches. According to a 
169,"road sign seen later, they are probably supposed to be on the eastern "
170,"section of the London Inner Ringroad, with its directions for the A1, "
171,"A40, A41, City, West End, Holborn, Marble Arch, and straight on for "
172,Aldgate and Shoreditch High Street. Congestion Zone charge area.)
173,DOCTOR: Clara! Clara! Clara! 
174,"(Rigsy arrives from the other direction.)CLARA: It's off this street, I am certain. "
175,"DOCTOR: We're very close. We need to distract our other senses. Clara, "
176,go back to the Tardis. Pick up all my most annoying stuff. (As she 
177,comes up the steps of the Tardis with a large clear plastic box 
178,containing various
179," brass musical instruments, Rigsy's phone - which is still plugged into "
180,the console - beeps. Data Recovered. She puts down the box and takes the
181, phone instead back to Westgate Street.)DOCTOR: What happened to the stuff I asked you to bring? 
182,"CLARA: Someone called you. Yesterday, 6am. Blocked number. "
183,"(As soon as Rigsy touches the phone, he drops it. He gets a vision of a girl lying on the pavement, and his"
184, phone falling. Then a big alien man in a fur coat runs up and sniffs her 
185,while an alien with a tall bone crest on his head crouches nearby.)RUMP [memory]: She's dead. DOCTOR: What is it? What are you remembering? 
186,(Rigsy stumbles.)
187,"CLARA: Rigsy, what is it? RIGSY: You can't see it? There! "
188,(What was previously the join between two buildings is now a tiny alley into a cobbled courtyard.)
189,"CLARA: I see it. You? DOCTOR: Fifty minutes left. Hoodie up, Local Knowledge. They know what you look like in there. "
190,
191,[Trap Street entrance]
192,"(The Doctor leads the way into the hidden street, which starts with a "
193,"courtyard area, then meanders in loops around and around. The "
194,"architecture is Elizabethan, Georgian, Victorian, with occasional "
195,"traders stalls against walls, and small alleyways or recesses between "
196,buildings. The whole place is permanently illuminated by street lamps.)
197,"RIGSY: How come I saw it when you guys couldn't? DOCTOR: You were upset, weren't you? Something slipped through the retconned "
198,memory. Something that took over your whole mind. Something juicy.
199,So the misdirection circuit lost its power over you. 
200,"CLARA: Surely people wander in here all the time, then, distracted, on their phones or whatever? DOCTOR: Well, perhaps they do (Light"
201,
202, zigzags through the cobbles and sticks their feet to the ground. An 
203,"alarm rings two men come out of hiding. As Rigsy looks at the tall man, "
204,he flickers to reveal he is the humanoid alien Rigsy saw yesterday. The 
205,"crested alien, Kabel, "
206,"flickers in and out of human form too, which is that of a shorter, dark,"
207," bespectacled man. His species is Lugal-Irra-Kush, as seen in Rings of Akhaten.)RUMP: Three at once. "
208,"KABEL: That's new. RUMP: Hang about. (sniffs the Doctor.) This one don't smell human. KABEL: Name, species and case for asylum. Quick as you like. DOCTOR: Asylum? KABEL: The reason you're here. The reason you need sanctuary. "
209,"(He grabs Rump's arm.)KABEL: Why didn't they use the protocol? RIGSY: (to the Doctor) I saw through the circuit again. I saw them. They're definitely not human. RUMP: You do know this is a refugee camp? DOCTOR: Yeah, of course. "
210,"(A familiar woman enters, hair up in large curls 1940s style, and escorted by two police officers.)ASHILDR: Of course he does, now that you've told him. "
211,(Rump and Kabel bow.)RUMP: Mayor Me. 
212,CLARA: Ashildr. ASHILDR: Ashildr? DOCTOR: That's your name. I keep telling you that. ASHILDR:
213," Do you? Infinite lifespan, finite memory. It makes for an awkward "
214,social life. You must be Clara Oswald. You're as beautiful as your 
215,"photos. CLARA: We met. ASHILDR: Yes, I know. It's in my diaries. Oh, don't look like that. I enjoyed our conversations. I've read them many times. CLARA: Okay, that's slightly odd, but nice. Er, hang on, so this is where you've been. That's why he lost track of you. "
216,"(The Doctor gives Clara a Look.)CLARA: Oh, come on, please. It's really cute he thinks I don't know. He's got "
217,this whole secret room in the Tardis where he collects mentions of you. ASHILDR: It's not cute. It's surveillance. DOCTOR: It's professional interest. 
218,"ASHILDR: Precautionary measure. DOCTOR: Still saving the world from me, then? ASHILDR: It's still here, isn't it? CLARA: He lost track of you in the early 1800s. I wondered if you were ASHILDR: Oh, no. I let him know I was okay."
219,"(Remember the photo of Clara and Evie Hubbard in The Woman Who Lived?) DOCTOR: I saw you. ASHLIDR: No, I got your attention. DOCTOR: Yes, you did, and you have. Now we need your help. Someone in this place is in control of a Quantum Shade. (The Doctor gestures to Rigsy, who lowers his hood and takes off his baseball cap. Rump snarls.)RUMP: I knew I recognised that smell. "
220,ASHILDR: Oh. 
221,(Ashildr turns her back on them.)
222,CLARA: Ashildr? What's going on? 
223,(Ashildr removes her scarf and turns around. She is wearing a large interesting pendant and has curly tattoos on her neck.)DOCTOR: You. ASHILDR: How do you know this man? CLARA: Hang on. You did this to Rigsy? 
224,"DOCTOR: What have you done? ASHILDR: This man committed a crime. I sentenced him. CLARA: Sentenced him? ASHILDR: I also gave him enough time to return home and say goodbye to his family. DOCTOR: You flooded his brain with retcon! Till we showed up, he didn't even know that he had to say goodbye. ASHILDR: I'm afraid no intruder leaves this place without a memory wipe. With respect, that will include you. CLARA: Oh, the hell it will. "
225,"DOCTOR: Ashildr, given we're all going to forget this conversation anyway, perhaps you could tell us"
226,"what happened here yesterday to necessitate a death sentence? ASHILDR: Fine, I'll show you. Mister Kabel, Mister Rump. Permit them entry. DOCTOR: No. You've already endangered one of my friends. I want your personal guarantee that you will not endanger another. CLARA: Shut up, I can handle myself. ASHILDR: I guarantee the safety of Clara Oswald. She will be under my personal protection. That is absolute. KABEL: If that's your wish, Mayor Me. "
227,(Kabel steps on a cobble and the light flashes to release their feet.)
228,ASHILDR: This way. 
229,RUMP: Murderer. CLARA: What did you say? 
230,(A flicker shows Rigsy and us that the policemen are Judoon.)
231,
232,[Trap Street]
233,RIGSY: Murderer. He called me a murderer. 
234,"(Further on, in an area of overhanging buildings, the whole idealised "
235,"Tudor shtick, people are shopping at small stalls by lamplight.)"
236,"DOCTOR: So you're still calling yourself Me, then? "
237,"ASHILDR: Me? DOCTOR: Mayor Me. ASHILDR: Mayor is a title. I give myself a title for the same reason you do, Doctor. Something to live up to. "
238,(A woman pulls her child aside as Rigsy passes them.)
239,"DOCTOR: Difficult, isn't it? "
240,WOMAN: You stay away from her.DOCTOR: How long have you been here? ASHILDR: Since Waterloo. DOCTOR: The battle? ASHILDR:
241," No, the station. Really, Doctor. Tread carefully while you're here. "
242,Some of your greatest enemies are within a few feet of you.
243,"As far as you're concerned, this is the most dangerous street in London."
244," CLARA: Fascinating. Now, can we skip to the part where you want Rigsy dead for some reason? "
245,WOMAN : It's him! He's back! 
246,(A bulky man stands up from a table in the street. Flicker - a Sontaran.)ASHILDR: It's best we get him inside first. SONTARAN: Murderer. You're not welcome here. RIGSY: They look at me as if they want to kill me themselves. MAN : Don't want your kind round here. SILURIAN: Murderer! 
247,WOMAN : Murderer.(Ashildr gestures to the people to calm down.)
248,"ASHILDR: Like I said, it's best we get inside. WOMAN : (alien words.) Keep away from us."
249,WOMAN 2 : Filthy murderer!
250,"(An oriental woman's face flickers to a blue alien. Round the corner, "
251,"Rigsy spots a young man with another face on the back of his head.)RIGSY: Wait, Clara. Look. "
252,(The young man turns and leaves. Clara pauses by a cage containing a raven. It'd better not turn out to be called Quoth.)
253,"DOCTOR: This misdirection circuit of yours is remarkable. The cloaking device that hides the street, "
254,"makes everyone look like humans. ASHILDR: It's no device. It's the Lurkworms. Quite something, aren't they? "
255,"(She nods towards the street lamps, which contain glowing worms instead of bulbs.)"
256,ASHILDR: The light is a telepathic field.
257,"It normalises everything you see, places it within the compass of your "
258,"expectations, your experiences. You can bypass them, of course. "
259,"(She nods towards a man having his head bandaged by a woman, then pinches his arm, hard.)DOCTOR: Aiee ah!"
260,"(Now the injured man is a Cyberman, being tended by an Ood.)"
261,"ASHILDR: Don't worry, we're perfectly safe. DOCTOR: Yes, a phrase I find is usually followed by a lot of screaming and running and bleeding. ASHILDR:"
262, I brokered a truce. We have strict rules against violence here. Rules 
263,every creature must abide by if they wish to remain
264,on the street. MAN [OC: Get away from us! 
265,"MAN 2 : Don't want your kind round here. ASHILDR: What's better, that they're in here with me, peaceful and cooperative, or out there on Earth like the Zygons?"
266,"We haven't had an act of violence on this street for a hundred years, until yesterday, when your friend here attacked"
267,"one of our most vulnerable residents. CLARA: How did Rigsy even get in? I mean, we barely managed it, "
268,
269,[Elizabethan House]
270,
271,"(Leaded windows to the street, wooden door fastened with a latch, "
272,high-tech container with green lasers holding the recently deceased 
273,upright. Lovely ornate staircase behind. Played by somewhere in the 
274,Cathays Park University Campus.)
275,CLARA: And we knew what we were looking for. 
276,
277,ASHILDR: She was found at the entrance of the street. 
278,(Rigsy remembers her.)
279,"ASHILDR: No weapon on the scene, but the cause of death is likely the head wound."
280,"Seems she was knocked to the cobblestones. CLARA: Seems? You've sentenced Rigsy to death yet you don't know exactly what's going on? ASHILDR: He was found over the body. My people were angry, frightened. I had to act. CLARA: This is ridiculous, this is RIGSY: What was her name? ASHILDR: Anah. We're keeping her here until someone can take her home for burial. DOCTOR: She's a Janus. ASHILDR: She escaped slavery. She fled here with her child. DOCTOR: The child. A daughter? ASHILDR: No, a boy. "
281,"CLARA: Is that bad? DOCTOR: No, it's not bad, it's just unhelpful. A daughter might've seen who killed her mother. "
282,(The Doctor nods to the back of Anah's head. Clara steps forward to see a second face there. )
283,DOCTOR: The female Janus is psychic.
284,"One face sees into the future, the other looks behind her, into the past. CLARA: I think we saw her son outside. RIGSY: Clara, what if I did do it? I mean, I wouldn't have meant to hurt her, "
285,"but, what if I wandered in and saw what she really looked like?"
286,What if I freaked? DOCTOR: You didn't just wander in here. You were called here at 6am by a number from a mystery phone. 
287,"CLARA: There is no way you did this. ASHILDR: So, what then? You think someone called him here? Set him up? CLARA: Yes! OLD MAN : Mayor! CLARA: Obviously. Which means one of your pet aliens out there is the real killer. (Banging on door.)OLD MAN : I just need to talk to her. ASHILDR: Excuse me. I'm sorry. DOCTOR: Yes. Please, go. It's not like we've got a ticking clock or anything. OLD MAN : Mayor, I beg of you, please "
288,(The Doctor checks the back of Rigsy's neck.)DOCTOR: Forty one minutes. 
289,
290,[Trap Street](A crowd stands at a discreet distance while an 
291,"old man and woman talk to Ashildr. In the credits, he is Chronolock Man,"
292, but that doesn't sound descriptive enough to me.)
293,"OLD MAN: Lock me up, throw us out, anything but this. Please. I only took it to save her. ASHILDR: How many minutes left? "
294,"(Rump checks the back of the man's neck.RUMP: Two, Madam Mayor. "
295,"(Ashildr addresses the crowd. The Doctor, Clara and Rigsy have come outside too.)"
296,ASHILDR: This man stole medical rations. He broke a rule of the street and he 
297,"stole from all of you. And yes, I can remove the chronolock."
298,"But I won't. Our rules keep us safe. OLD WOMAN: Give it to me. Please. Tell me I can have it. One word. Say it. Say yes. OLD MAN: I did this to save you, you silly old thing. You really think I could lose you now? "
299,(Ashildr breaths in and closes her eyes. The tattoo on her neck becomes smoke and leaves her.)
300,RIGSY: What's happening? 
301,DOCTOR: It's called a Quantum Shade. It's kind of a spirit. Once it's bound to a
302, victim 
303,(The Raven turns to smoke and leaves its cage.)
304,"DOCTOR: You could flee across all of time and all of the universe,"
305,"it would still find you. (The old man and woman embrace, then the Raven lands on an awning above a stall and caws. The old man is frightened.)KABEL: Don't run. Stay with her. (The old man runs into a house.) OLD WOMAN: Don't go! KABEL: Why do they always run? "
306,"(The Raven flies through the closed door. The old man runs out of another.)OLD MAN : Help me, somebody, please! DOCTOR: At least give him a merciful death. "
307,"OLD MAN : Oh, no! Oh, no! ASHILDR: Do you think a Cyberman fears a merciful death? OLD MAN : Help me! Help me, please! Please, please, anybody.ASHILDR: Peace on this street depends on one thing. To break it in any way is to face the Raven. OLD MAN : No! No! Please help me! (The"
308, old man runs through the street maze until the tattoo on his neck 
309,"changes to zero, then the Raven flies into his back. The old man "
310,"arches his back and screams, then falls to his knees as smoke billows out of his mouth. "
311,"Kabel goes to comfort the old woman as the man falls sideways, dead. The"
312," Raven flies away and the Quantum Shade tattoo returns to Ashildr's neck.)ASHILDR: I have no wish to harm your friend if he is innocent, Doctor. Question anyone. Examine the body. "
313,But it's not me you need to convince of Rigsy's innocence. It's them. (Ashildr
314, leaves with her police escort. The Doctor looks at a watch then rubs 
315,"the back of his neck. Rigsy makes a phone call in the background.)CLARA: Okay, we split up. Cover more ground. I'm good cop, you're bad cop. DOCTOR: No, no, no, we don't have. Can I not be the good cop? CLARA: Doctor, we've discussed this. Your face. DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Well, forget about cops, right? Forget about finding the real killer. You "
316,heard Ashildr. All we have to do is persuade these creatures
317,"that it isn't Rigsy. And fast. (A baby cries somewhere.)RIGSY: Shush. Shush, baby girl.JEN : She's been like this all day.RIGSY: Listen, you be good for your mum for me, okay? And I'm doing my best to get home to you guys. JEN : She won't stop crying. RIGSY: Yeah, I know. Yeah, she can probably tell you're upset. CLARA:"
318," Rump? It's er Rump, isn't it? That man's wife. She said something. Give"
319," it to me, tell me I can have it. What did she mean? RUMP: Two ways to survive a Quantum Shade. The Shade's master removes the chronolock, or you can give it to someone else. CLARA: Give it? You can just RUMP: No, you can't just push it on someone. It's not that simple. It has to be taken willingly. The death's already locked in."
320,"You can pass it on, but you can't cheat it. (Rump leaves. Clara turns and sees the Janus boy. She waves, and he leaves.)"
321,"(In a quiet corner, where there are various posters on the wall "
322,"including one of a flux capacitor, and what I am assured is the word "
323,Delorian in Star Wars script.)
324,"RIGSY: You're serious? You actually expect me to give you my death sentence? CLARA: Ssh! Go on. I've always wanted a tattoo. You know, something small, discreet. RIGSY: Clara. Cut it out. CLARA:"
325, Weren't you listening? I'm under the Mayor's personal protection. And 
326,"it's absolute, apparently. Look, she controls the Raven,"
327,so I will never have to face it. This is clever. RIGSY: But this is putting you in danger. CLARA:
328," No, this is us talking the opposition into their own trap. This is "
329,Doctor 101. We're buying time. We get all of the aliens on our side in the 
330,"next half an hour, and then we reveal I've got the chronolock, not you, "
331,and boom!
332,We buy ourselves more time to find the real killer. 
333,RIGSY: The Doctor would never let you do this. CLARA: Doctor 102. 
334,Never tell anyone your actual plan. He'll have a tantrum when he finds 
335,"out. And then, when we confront Ashildr,"
336,she'll want to take the chronolock off just to shut him up. What happens
337," if you don't go home tonight to Jen and Lucy, eh?"
338,If you never go home? You really want your little girl growing up 
339,without a father just because he wouldn't take a risk?
340,"You trusted us to save you, so trust us. Come on. RIGSY: Okay. All right. Right, how do we do this, then? CLARA:"
341," Well, I was kind of hoping that would be it. I say I want it, you say, "
342,"you can have it. You know, done deal. Hey, turn around, let me see. (Rigsy's"
343," tattoo says 033. Clara touches it and it turns to smoke, then moves to "
344,the back of her neck. The Raven caws in its cage. Rigsy looks at Clara's
345," new tattoo.)RIGSY: So this is your life, then? Just bouncing around time, saving people, right? CLARA:"
346," No, not every day. Sometimes Jane Austen and I prank each other. Oh, "
347,she is the worst. I love her. Take that how you like. 
348,(Clara walks off.)
349,"(Meanwhile, Rump is drinking from a pewter tankard outside what is presumably an ale house.)DOCTOR: Are you sure it wasn't someone from the street? RUMP: I've told you already there wasn't anyone up that end of the street except Anah and the human. DOCTOR: I've identified twenty seven different species on this street so far, fifteen of whom are known for aggression."
350,"Why is it so hard to believe that one of them is capable of murder? RUMP: Capable of murder, yeah. Capable of killing Anah? No. DOCTOR: Why not? What's so special about her? (Clara is interviewing women in the street.)HABRIAN WOMAN: It was the way she looked at you, like she understood. "
351,"GREY-HAIRED WOMAN: One glance into your past and she felt it all. Every battle, every loss. DOCTOR: So you just want the human dead, is that it? RUMP: You don't get it, do you? If the human didn't do it, that means one of us did it, which means folks start pointing"
352,"fingers, turning on each other. And once we turn on each other in here, that's it. I might as well be back in a war zone. DOCTOR: So you'll just let Rigsy die? "
353,"RUMP: To keep the peace? Yeah, I will. "
354,"(By a drinks stall.)KABEL: Your friend, acting like he was all scared of us, calling for a doctor. DOCTOR: A what? "
355,"KABEL: I know. The cheek of it. Humans can survive losing entire limbs and I'm supposed to believe he DOCTOR: Shut up! Shut up. The other thing you said, the second thing. What, what, what, you said he was scared and? "
356,"KABEL: And he asked the Mayor to call him a doctor. Poor Anah, dead at his feet, and DOCTOR: Shh. Did he say a doctor or the doctor? This is very, very important. KABEL: The doctor. There was nothing wrong with him, mind. It was all just your standard human lies."
357,(The Doctor runs off to a meeting with Clara and Rigsy by a vegetable stall.) DOCTOR: Clara gave you my number for emergencies. So when you wake up with a 
358,"weird tattoo on your neck and no memory of the last twenty four hours,"
359,the first thing you do is call the Doctor. RIGSY: Call the Doctor?
360,DOCTOR: But you find yourself accused of murder on a strange alien 
361,"street in the middle of London. Only they've taken your phone, so you beg the woman in charge to call me instead. She knew you and I were friends. So why'd she lie? Unless she had something to hide."
362,"WOMAN: Murderer! DOCTOR: There's something very wrong here and we're running out of time. CLARA: Ahem. There's twelve minutes left. I'm not giving up yet. RIGSY: Look, Clara, even if one of them knows something, they're not going to come forward. The way they look at me. CLARA: The way they look at you? RIGSY: What?"
363,
364,[Outside Anah's home]
365,(Clara knocks at the door of the Janus boy. He opens it then starts to closes it again.)CLARA:
366," Hey, wait. Everyone here is weird around us because of Rigsy. But not "
367,you. You look at me and the Doctor like you're confused.
368,"Like you're curious. ANAHSON: I don't know what you mean. CLARA: You do. You know Rigsy is innocent because you can look into his past and you can see it, can't you? "
369,  
370,
371,[Anah's home]
372,
373,(Clara and Anahson are sitting on the settee.)
374,"CLARA: She dressed you as a boy to protect you, but really you're a girl. You have the gift. ANAHSON: It is no gift. I'm safe as a boy. This is the first place I've ever been"
375," safe, and you want me to throw it away? To admit what I am? "
376,"DOCTOR: The Mayor. What is she up to? It's nothing good, is it? ANAHSON: I can't see everything, but she thinks she's doing the right thing. DOCTOR: They usually do. If what Ashildr is doing is harmless, then we'll just walk out of that "
377,"door. No one will know of your abilities. But if it's not ANAHSON: I don't know what she means to do. No, I'm trying, but I can't see it. I can't see it because it involves you."
378,"When I look at you, I can't tell your past from your future, and there's so very much of both. "
379,(The Doctor walks around to the back of the settee.)
380,"DOCTOR: This isn't about Rigsy. It's about me. (Anahson closes her eyes, and the face on the back of her head opens its eyes and speaks with a slightly distorted voice.)ANAHSON 2: She couldn't just ask you here. She needed a mystery. You can never resist a mystery. She's afraid. DOCTOR: Afraid of what? Of whom? ANAHSON 2: I can't see. "
381,"(The second face closes its eyes, and the first one opens heirs.)"
382,ANAHSON: I'm sorry. 
383,[Trap Street]
384,
385,"(They run past the Raven's cage, and it caws.)DOCTOR: You hold your tongue. We've got ten minutes left! "
386,[Elizabethan House]
387,
388,DOCTOR: Ashildr said Anah was being taken home for burial. But the Janus burn their dead. 
389,RIGSY: Is that true? 
390,"(Anahson nods.)CLARA: So, look, Ashildr got it wrong. What does it matter? Come on! "
391,"DOCTOR: There's something about this tech RIGSY: Look, Doctor, we don't have time,ANAHSON: What is it? "
392,"(The Doctor activates a screen on a slot machine style er, machine.)DOCTOR: It looks like medical data. ANAHSON: But it can't be. She's dead. She isn't breathing. DOCTOR: This thing's a stasis pod. If you're dead, it's a kind of fancy "
393,refrigerator. But if you're alive 
394,"(He turns on the speakers, and a heartbeat sounds.)"
395,DOCTOR: It simply keeps you that 
396,"way. ANAHSON: She's alive? DOCTOR: She's alive. ANAHSON: Well, get her out! Get her out of there! DOCTOR: There must be a way to unlock it. Something basic, something simple that I'm missing. "
397,"(Randomly pressing symbols on the screen, beep, beep.)"
398,"RIGSY: A keyhole! DOCTOR: A keyhole would be very handy, yes, but I haven't got one."
399,"RIGSY: No, no, no, a keyhole! Look! "
400,"(In the side of the base of the machine.)ANAHSON: I'll find her. I'll get the key. DOCTOR: No, Anahson, stay here. There's a reason that the Mayor has gone AWOL. She "
401,"means for us to release your mother, but she doesn't want us to use her "
402,key.
403,She wants to use mine. 
404,(The Doctor holds up a Yale key.)CLARA: The Tardis. That's what this is about.
405,"(He goes to unlock the stasis chamber base.)CLARA: Doctor, wait! DOCTOR: This girl needs her mother. Ah!"
406,(Clunk!)CLARA: Doctor! DOCTOR: I can't CLARA: What's it doing? (The
407," Doctor pulls his right arm out with his left, the panel slides shut, the green lasers "
408,"disappear, and Anah breaths. The Doctor has a steel bracelet firmly "
409,clamped on his right forearm. Rigsy and Anahson catch Anah before she 
410,"falls.)ANAHSON: Mum! Mum, are you okay? "
411,"ASHILDR: She'll be perfectly fine in a few moments. I assure you. DOCTOR: There are easier ways to steal a key, you know. ASHILDR: I don't want your Tardis. That's not what this is about. Rigsy, come here, I'll remove your chronolock. DOCTOR: What is this, Ashildr? You can't possibly think this is going to keep me here. ASHILDR: It's not a restraint. It's a teleport bracelet. "
412,"(Shouldn't that be transmat, given that this is Dr Who?)CLARA: What? ASHILDR: I'll give you time to say goodbye, don't worry. No one will be hurt. DOCTOR: Where are you sending me? ASHILDR: I made a deal to protect the street. They take you, I take the key so "
413,"you can't be traced. I do as they tell me, and the street is safe. DOCTOR: They? Who are they? ASHILDR:"
414, One more thing. Your confession dial. They have other means of 
415,"procuring it, but I understand it's likely to be on your person."
416,"Please, no resistance. You've already lost. "
417,"(The Doctor hands over the engraved disc.)ASHILDR: What is it? DOCTOR: In your terms, my last will and testament. ASHILDR: How does it work? DOCTOR: I've no idea. ASHILDR: Well, thank you anyway. "
418,"(Ashildr puts the confession dial on a mantelpiece.)ASHILDR: Rigsy, your neck. RIGSY: Clara, what are you playing at? The chronolock! "
419,CLARA: Take the teleport off him first. (Ashildr reaches for Rigsy's neck.)
420,"RIGSY: I don't have it, I'm telling you. Clara does."
421,"(Clara shows Ashildr the back of her neck.)ASHILDR: No. No, you didn't. "
422,"(008.)CLARA: Go on, then. Take it off. DOCTOR: Clara, you didn't! "
423,(The Doctor turns Clara around and stares at the numbers in horror.)
424,"ASHILDR: I had no idea she'd do something so stupid. I swear, I never "
425,"meant for anyone to get hurt. Look, what were you thinking? Sacrificing "
426,"yourself? CLARA: I wasn't sacrificing anything. It was strategy. Backup plan, to buy us more time. DOCTOR: Who told you to give it to her? CLARA: Nobody did. I did. Rump said DOCTOR: What exactly did Rump say? CLARA: He said the death is locked in. You can pass it on, but you"
427,(Clara realises her folly.)
428,DOCTOR: But what? CLARA: But 
429,"ASHILDR: But you can't cheat it altogether. (The Raven caws in its cage.)RIGSY: Clara, you didn't tell me that. Give it back to me, now. ASHILDR: She can't. Clara, I made a contract with the Shade when I put the "
430,chronolock on Rigsy. I promised it a soul and only I can break that 
431,contract.
432,"When you took it from him, you changed the terms. You cut me out of the "
433,"deal. (The Quantum Shade Raven leaves its cage.)CLARA: We can fix this, can't we? We always fix it. DOCTOR: No. (to Ashildr) But you can. Fix this. Fix it now. ASHILDR: It, it's not possible. I can't. DOCTOR: Yes, it is, you can, and you will, or this street will be over. I'll "
434,show you and all your funny little friends to the whole laughing world.
435,"I'll bring UNIT, I'll bring the Zygons. Give me a minute, I'll bring the"
436," Daleks and the Cybermen. You will save Clara, and you will do it now,"
437,"or I will rain hell on you for the rest of time. CLARA: Doctor, stop talking like that. "
438,ASHILDR: You can't. DOCTOR: I can do whatever the hell I like. You've read the stories. You know who
439," I am. And in all of that time, did you ever hear anything"
440,"about anyone who stopped me? ASHILDR: I know the Doctor. The Doctor would never DOCTOR: The Doctor is no longer here! You are stuck with me. And I will end you, and everything you love. CLARA: Doctor, for God's sake, will you stop? DOCTOR: Now! CLARA: I did this, do you hear me? I did this. This is my fault. DOCTOR: I don't care. CLARA:"
441, Liar. You always care. Always have. Your reign of terror will end with 
442,"the sight of the first crying child and you know it. DOCTOR: No, I don't. CLARA: I do. Listen, if this is the last I ever see of you, please, not like this. (The Raven caws in the distance.)CLARA: (to Ashildr) Is there anything you can do? ASHILDR: I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry, I CLARA: Time's short. Yes or no? ASHILDR: No. (The Doctor breathes heavily. Rigsy is trying not to cry.)CLARA: Well, if Danny Pink can do it, so can I. DOCTOR: Do what? CLARA: Die right. Die like I mean it. Face the Raven. DOCTOR: No. This, this isn't happening. This can't be happening. CLARA: Maybe this is what I wanted. Maybe this is it. Maybe this is why I kept "
443,running. Maybe this is why I kept taking all those stupid risks.
444,Kept pushing it. 
445,DOCTOR: This is my fault. 
446,CLARA: This is my choice. 
447,DOCTOR: I let you get 
448,reckless. CLARA: Why? Why shouldn't I be so reckless? You're reckless all the bloody time. Why can't I be like you? DOCTOR:
449," Clara, there's nothing special about me. I am nothing, but I'm less "
450,"breakable than you. I should have taken care of you. CLARA: I never asked you to. DOCTOR: You shouldn't have to ask. (The Raven caws as it flies along the winding street, and the people scatter, terrified.)RIGSY: Clara, if I'd known, I'd CLARA: Don't. Shut up. RIGSY: But ICLARA: Really, Rigsy, shut up. If you feel guilty about this, even for one minute, I (They hear the Raven.)"
451,"CLARA: You. Now, you listen to me. You're going to be alone now, and you're very bad"
452," at that. You're going to be furious and you're going to be sad,"
453,"but listen to me. Don't let this change you. No, listen. Whatever "
454,"happens next, wherever she is sending you, I know what you're capable of."
455, You don't be a Warrior. 
456,
457,Promise me. Be a Doctor. DOCTOR: What's the point of being a Doctor if I can't cure you? CLARA: Heal yourself. You have to. You can't let this turn you into a monster. 
458,"So, I'm not asking you for a promise, I'm giving you an order."
459,"You will not insult my memory. There will be no revenge. I will die, and"
460," no one else, here or anywhere, will suffer. DOCTOR: What about me? CLARA: If there was something I could do about that, I would. I guess we're both just going to have to be brave. DOCTOR: Clara."
461,"(They hug.)CLARA: Everything you are about to say, I already know. Don't do it now. We've already had enough bad timing. (The Raven caws close by.)DOCTOR: Don't run. Stay with me. CLARA: Nah. You stay here. In the end, everybody does this alone. DOCTOR: Clara CLARA: This is as brave as I know how to be. I know it's going to hurt you, but, please, be a little proud of me. "
462,(She touches his cheek. He takes her hand and kisses it.)
463,"CLARA: Goodbye, Doctor. (The Raven caws.) "

465,[Trap Street]
466,
467,(Clara steps out into the deserted street. The Raven lands on a nearby stall and 
468,caws. She walks towards it as other passers-by run away. The Doctor steps 
469,out of the doorway.)CLARA: (sotto) Let me be brave. Let me be brave.(The
470, Raven launches itself from its perch. Clara opens her arms wide and it 
471,flies into her stomach. She opens her mouth wide in a silent scream - or
472, at least one completely drowned out by the music - then relaxes and the Quantum Shade smoke 
473,comes out of her mouth as she falls to the ground.)

475,[Elizabethan House]

477,(Eventually the Doctor enters and shuts the door.)
478,"ASHILDR: I'm sorry, Doctor. I truly am. (Ashildr steps up to the stasis chamber control panel and makes it beep, then steps away again.)DOCTOR: What Clara said about not taking revenge. Do you know why she said that? ASHILDR: She was saving you. "
479,"DOCTOR: I was lost a long time ago. She was saving you. I'll do my best, but I strongly advise you to keep out of my way. You'll"
480, find that it's a very small universe when I'm angry with you. (Ashildr
481," nods. The teleport bracelet beeps, then the Doctor is gently beamed "
482,away in purple and white light while Ashildr turns her back. The bracelet drops to the floor with a 
483,clang.)
