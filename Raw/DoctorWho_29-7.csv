20,(The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver on Martha's
21,mobile phone.) 
22,"DOCTOR: Right, there we go. Universal roaming. Never have to worry"
23,about a signal again. 
24,"MARTHA: No way. This is too mad. You're telling me I can phone anyone,"
25,anywhere in space and time on my mobile? 
26,DOCTOR: As long as you know the area code. Frequent flier's privilege.
27,"Go on, try it. "
28,(The Tardis judders.) 
29,DOCTOR: Distress signal. Locking on. Might be a bit of 
30,(They get knocked to the floor.) 
31,"DOCTOR: Turbulence. Sorry. Come on, Martha. Let's take a look."
32,
33,[Area 30]
34,
35,(Lots of steam and the place is glowing red.) 
36,COMPUTER: Distress signal transmitted. 
37,"DOCTOR: Whoa, now that is hot. "
38,COMPUTER: Automated distress signal transmitted. 
39,"MARTHA: Whuff, it's like a sauna in here. "
40,"DOCTOR: Venting systems. Working at full pelt, trying to cool down."
41,"Wherever it is we are. Well, if you can't stand the heat"

45,(The Doctor opens a bulkhead door and goes through.
46,"On the other side, it is labelled Area 30. Two men and a woman come"
47,running towards them.) 
48,"RILEY: (a young man) Oi, you two! "
49,McDONNELL: (a woman) Get out of there! 
50,"RILEY: Seal that door, now! "
51,McDONNELL: Who are you? What are you doing on my ship? 
52,RILEY: Are you police? 
53,DOCTOR: Why would we be police? 
54,MARTHA: We got your distress signal. 
55,"DOCTOR: If this is a ship, why can't I hear any engines? "
56,McDONNELL: It went dead four minutes ago. 
57,SCANNELL: So maybe we should stop chatting and get to Engineering.
58,Captain. 
59,COMPUTER: Secure closure active. 
60,McDONNELL: What? 
61,SCANNELL: The ship's gone mad. 
62,"(Another woman comes running towards them, bulkheads slamming shut"
63,behind her.) 
64,ERINA: : Who activated secure closure? I nearly got locked in to area
65,twenty seven. 
66,(The last bulkhead slams shut.) 
67,ERINA: Who are you? 
68,MARTHA: He's the Doctor and I'm Martha. Hello. 
69,COMPUTER: Impact projection forty two minutes twenty seven seconds. 
70,McDONNELL: We'll get out of this. I promise. 
71,(Martha looks out of a porthole.) 
72,MARTHA: Doctor. 
73,DOCTOR: Forty two minutes until what? 
74,MARTHA: Doctor! Look. 
75,McDONNELL: Forty two minutes until we crash into the sun. 
76,"(The long, thin, but utilitarian spaceship is spinning towards a"
77,massive yellow fusion reactor.) 
78,DOCTOR: How many crew members on board? 
79,"McDONNELL: Seven, including us. "
80,SCANNELL: We transport cargo across the galaxy. Everything's automated.
81,We just keep the ship spaceworthy. 
82,"DOCTOR: Call the others, I'll get you out. "
83,(The Doctor runs to the door to area 30.) 
84,RILEY: What's he doing? 
85,"McDONNELL: No, don't! "
86,(The Doctor opens the door and is knocked down by the blast of heat.
87,Erina puts on a
88,welder's mask and shuts it again.) 
89,DOCTOR: But my ship's in there! 
90,RILEY: In the vent chamber? 
91,DOCTOR: It's our lifeboat. 
92,SCANNELL: It's lava. 
93,ERINA: The temperature's going mad in there. Up three thousand degrees
94,"in ten seconds, and still rising. "
95,"RILEY: Channelling the air. The closer we get to the sun, the hotter"
96,that room's
97,going to get. 
98,MARTHA: We're stuck here. 
99,"DOCTOR: So, we fix the engines, we steer the ship away from the sun."
100,"Simple. Engineering down here, is it? "
101,McDONNELL: Yes. 
102,COMPUTER: Impact in forty twenty six.
103,
104,[Engineering]
105,
106,"DOCTOR: Blimey, do you always leave things in such"
107,a mess? 
108,"McDONNELL: Oh, my God. "
109,SCANNELL: What the hell happened? 
110,(The engine is a collection of bits and pieces.) 
111,"RILEY: Oh, it's wrecked. "
112,DOCTOR: Pretty efficiently too. Someone knew what they were doing. 
113,McDONNELL: Where's Korwin? Has anyone heard from him or Ashton? 
114,SCANNELL: No. 
115,MARTHA: You mean someone did this on purpose? 
116,(Kath McDonnell goes to the intercom.) 
117,"McDONNELL: Korwin, Ashton? Where are you? Korwin, can you answer? Where"
118,the hell is he? He should be up here. 
119,"DOCTOR: Oh, we're in the Torajii system. Lovely. You're a long way from"
120,"home, Martha. Half a universe away. "
121,MARTHA: Yeah. Feels it. 
122,DOCTOR: And you're still using energy scoops for fusion? Hasn't that
123,been outlawed yet? 
124,"McDONNELL: We're due to upgrade next docking. Scannell, engine report. "
125,SCANNELL: No response. 
126,McDONNELL: What? 
127,SCANNELL: They're burnt out. The controls are wrecked. I can't get them
128,back online. 
129,"DOCTOR: Oh, come on. Auxiliary engines. Every craft's got auxiliaries. "
130,McDONNELL: We don't have access from here. The auxiliary controls are
131,in the front of the ship. 
132,"SCANNELL: Yeah, with twenty nine password sealed doors between us and"
133,them. You'll never get there in time. 
134,MARTHA: Can't you override the doors? 
135,SCANNELL: No. Sealed closure means what it says. They're all dead-lock
136,sealed. 
137,DOCTOR: So a sonic screwdriver's no use. 
138,"SCANNELL: Nothing's any use. We've got no engines, no time, and no"
139,chance. 
140,"DOCTOR: Oh, listen to you. Defeated before you've even started. Where's"
141,your Dunkirk spirit? Who's got the door passwords? 
142,RILEY: They're randomly generated. Reckon I know most of them. Sorry.
143,Riley Vashti. 
144,"DOCTOR: Then what're you waiting for, Riley Vashti? Get on it. "
145,"RILEY: Well, it's a two person job. One, a technish for the questions,"
146,and the other to carry this. The oldest and cheapest security system
147,"around, eh, Captain? "
148,"McDONNELL: Reliable and simple, just like you, eh, Riley? "
149,(Riley puts a massive backpack on. It contains a portable computer and
150,a keyboard.) 
151,"RILEY: Try and be helpful, get abuse. Nice. "
152,MARTHA: I'll help you. Make myself useful. 
153,RILEY: It's remotely controlled by the computer panel. That's why it
154,needs two. 
155,DOCTOR: Oi. Be careful. 
156,MARTHA: You too. 
157,ASHTON : McDonnell. It's Ashton. 
158,McDONNELL: Where are you? Is Korwin with you? 
159,ASHTON : Get up to the med-centre now! 
160,(The Doctor and McDonnell run out past Martha and Riley.) 
161,COMPUTER: Impact in thirty four thirty one.

164,
165,(A man and a woman are trying to hold a man down so
166,"they can put him in what looks like an MRI scanner, but turns out to be"
167,a stasis chamber.) 
168,KORWIN: Argh! Stop it! 
169,"ABI: Korwin, it's Abi. Open your eyes, I need to take a look at you. "
170,(McDonnell and the Doctor run in.) 
171,McDONNELL: Korwin! What's happened? Is he okay? 
172,KORWIN: Help me! It's burning me! 
173,DOCTOR: How long's he been like this? 
174,ABI: Ashton just brought him in. 
175,(The Doctor scans Korwin with his screwdriver.) 
176,McDONNELL: What are you doing? 
177,DOCTOR: Don't get too close. 
178,McDONNELL: Don't be so stupid. That's my husband. 
179,ASHTON: And he's just sabotaged our ship. 
180,McDONNELL: What? 
181,"ASHTON: He went mad. He put the ship onto secure closure, then he set"
182,the heat pulse to melt the controls. 
183,McDONNELL: No way. He wouldn't do that. 
184,"ASHTON: I saw it happen, Captain. "
185,"DOCTOR: Korwin? Korwin, open your eyes for me a second. "
186,KORWIN: I can't! 
187,"DOCTOR: Yeah, course you can. Go on. "
188,"KORWIN: Don't make me look at you, please. "
189,(The Doctor takes a hypo-gun from a medical tray.) 
190,"DOCTOR: All right, all right, all right. Just relax. Sedative? "
191,ABI: Yes. 
192,(The Doctor sedates Korwin.) 
193,McDONNELL: What's wrong with him? 
194,"DOCTOR: Rising body temperature, unusual energy readings. Stasis"
195,chamber. I do love a good stasis chamber. Keep him sedated in there.
196,"Regulate the body temperature. And, just for fun, run a bioscan and"
197,tissue profile on a metabolic detail. 
198,ABI: Just doing them now. 
199,"DOCTOR: Oh, you're good. Anyone else presenting these symptoms? "
200,ABI: Not so far. 
201,"DOCTOR: Well, that's something. "
202,McDONNELL: Will someone tell me what is the matter with him? 
203,DOCTOR: Some sort of infection. We'll know more after the test results.
204,"Now, allons-y, back downstairs. Hey. See about those engines. Go. Hey."
205,Go. 
206,(McDonnell follows Ashton out.) 
207,DOCTOR: Call us if there's news. Any questions? 
208,ABI: Yeah. Who are you? 
209,DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. 
210,(The Doctor leaves. Korwin's hands twitch.) 
211,COMPUTER: Heat shield failing. At twenty-five percent. Impact in thirty
212,two fifty.

214,[Area 29]
215,
216,(Riley is tapping away at the portable computer.) 
217,"MARTHA: Hurry up, will you? "
218,RILEY: All right. Fix the clamp on. 
219,MARTHA: What are you typing? 
220,RILEY: Each door's trip code is the answer to a random question set by
221,"the crew. Nine tours back, we got drunk, thought them up. Reckoning"
222,"was, if we're hijacked, we're the only ones who know all the answers. "
223,MARTHA: So you type in the right answer 
224,RILEY: This sends an unlock pulse to the clamp. But we only get one
225,"chance per door. Get it wrong, the whole system freezes. "
226,MARTHA: Better not get it wrong then. 
227,RILEY: Okay. Date of SS Pentallian's first flight. That's all right.
228,Go! 
229,(The lights on the clamp go green and the bulkhead door opens.) 
230,MARTHA: Yes! 
231,RILEY: Twenty eight more to go!
232,
233,[Med-centre]
234,
235,"DOCTOR : Abi, how's Korwin doing? Any results"
236,from the bio-scan? 
237,ABI: He's under heavy sedation. I'm just trying to make sense of this
238,data. Give me a couple of minutes and I'll let you know. 
239,(Korwin starts to wake up.)
240,
241,[Engineering]
242,
243,DOCTOR: Martha? Riley? How're you doing?
244,
245,[Area 28]
246,
247,MARTHA: Area twenty nine 
248,[Engineering]
249,
250,MARTHA : At the door to twenty eight. 
251,"DOCTOR: Yeah, you've "
252,[Area 28]
253,
254,DOCTOR : Got to move faster. 
255,MARTHA: We're doing our best. 
256,RILEY: Find the next number in the sequence three one three
257,
258,[Engineering]
259,
260,"RILEY : Three three one, three six seven. "
261,[Area 28]
262,
263,RILEY: What? 
264,MARTHA: You said the crew knew all the answers. 
265,RILEY: The crew's changed since we set the questions. 
266,MARTHA: You're joking.
267,
268,[Engineering]
269,
270,DOCTOR: Three seven nine. 
271,MARTHA : What? 
272,DOCTOR: It's a sequence of 
273,[Area 28]
274,
275,DOCTOR : Happy primes. Three seven nine. 
276,MARTHA: Happy what?
277,
278,[Engineering]
279,
280,DOCTOR: Just enter it.
281,
282,[Area 28]
283,
284,RILEY: Are you sure? We only get one chance.
285,
286,[Engineering]
287,
288,DOCTOR: Any number that reduces to one when you
289,take the sum of the square of its digits 
290,[Area 28]
291,
292,DOCTOR : And you continue iterating until it
293,yields one is a happy number. 
294,[Engineering]
295,
296,"DOCTOR: Any number that doesn't, isn't. A happy"
297,prime is a number that is both happy and prime. Now type it in! I don't
298,"know, talk about dumbing down! Don't they teach recreational"
299,mathematics any more?
300,
301,[Area 28]
302,
303,MARTHA: We're through! 
304,"DOCTOR : Keep moving, fast as you can. "
305,[Engineering]
306,
307,"DOCTOR: And, Martha, be careful. "
308,[Area 28]
309,
310,DOCTOR : There may be something else on board
311,this ship. 
312,"MARTHA: Any time you want to unnerve me, feel free."
313,
314,[Engineering]
315,
316,"DOCTOR: Will do, thanks. "
317,COMPUTER: Impact in thirty fifty.
318,
319,[Area 27]
320,
321,MARTHA: I can't believe our lives depend on some
322,stupid pub quiz. Is that the next one? 
323,"RILEY: Oh, this is a nightmare. Classical music. Who had the most"
324,"pre-download number ones, Elvis Presley or The Be-atles? How are we"
325,supposed to know that?
326,
327,[Engineering]
328,
329,DOCTOR: We need a backup in case they don't reach
330,"the auxiliary engines in time. Come on, think. Resources. What have we"
331,got? 
332,MARTHA : Doctor? 
333,DOCTOR: What is it now?
334,
335,[Area 27]
336,
337,"MARTHA: Who had the most number ones, Elvis "
338,[Engineering]
339,
340,MARTHA : Or the Beatles. That's pre-download. 
341,DOCTOR: Elvis. 
342,[Area 27]
343,
344,DOCTOR : No! The Beatles! 
345,[Engineering]
346,
347,"DOCTOR: No! Wait! Er, er. Oh, what was that remix?"
348,"Er, I don't know. I am a bit busy."
349,
350,[Area 27]
351,
352,MARTHA: Fine. I'll ask someone else.
353,
354,[Engineering]
355,
356,"DOCTOR: Now, where was I? Here comes the sun. No,"
357,"resources. So, the power's still working, the generator's going. If we"
358,can harness that. Ah! 
359,McDONNELL: Use the generator to jump-start the ship. 
360,"DOCTOR: Exactly. At the very least, it'll buy us some more time. "
361,McDONNELL: That is brilliant. 
362,DOCTOR: I know. See? Tiny glimmer of hope. 
363,SCANNELL: If it works. 
364,"McDONNELL: Oh, believe me. You're going to make it work. "
365,DOCTOR: That told him. 
366,COMPUTER: Impact in twenty nine forty six.

371,FRANCINE: Hello? 
372,MARTHA : Mum? It's me. 
373,[Area 27]
374,
375,MARTHA: It's Martha. Wow! 
376,FRANCINE : Where are you? 
377,[Francine's home]
378,
379,FRANCINE: Don't you check your messages? I've been
380,calling you.
381,

384,"MARTHA: Actually, a bit busy. Need you to do"
385,something 
386,[Francine's home]
387,
388,MARTHA : For me. 
389,"FRANCINE: No, listen to me. "
390,[Francine's home]
391,
392,FRANCINE: We have to talk 
393,[Area 27]
394,
395,FRANCINE : About this Doctor. 
396,"MARTHA: Mum, please, not now. I need you to look something up on the"
397,internet.
398,
399,[Francine's home]
400,
401,FRANCINE: Do it yourself. You've got a computer.
402,

404,
405,"MARTHA: Oh, just do it, will you? Please."
406,
407,[Francine's home]
408,
409,FRANCINE: When did you get so rude? I'll tell you
410,when. Ever since you met that man. 
411,MARTHA: I need to know who had more number ones. 
412,[Area 27]
413,
414,MARTHA: The Beatles or Elvis? 
415,[Francine's home]
416,
417,"FRANCINE: Hang on, the mouse is unplugged. Okay,"
418,I'm on. 
419,[Area 27]
420,
421,"FRANCINE : What is this, a pub quiz? "
422,"MARTHA: Yeah, a pub quiz."
423,
424,[Francine's home]
425,
426,FRANCINE: Using your mobile is cheating.
427,
428,[Area 27]
429,
430,MARTHA: Have you found it? 
431,FRANCINE : There's over four hundred thousand results. Give me a
432,minute. 
433,COMPUTER: Impact in twenty eight fifty.

437,"ABI: Doctor, these readings are starting to scare"
438,me.

441,
442,DOCTOR: What do you mean? 
443,"ABI : Well, Korwin's body's changing. His whole biological make-up."
444,
445,[Med-centre]
446,
447,ABI: It's impossible. 
448,"(Abi hears a noise behind her, and sees Korwin's reflection in a steel"
449,"bowl above the intercom. He is standing there, eyes shut.) "
450,ABI: This is Med-centre. Urgent assistance requested.

477,SCANNELL: Captain? 
478,DOCTOR: I told you to stay in Engineering. 
479,SCANNELL: I only take orders form one person round here. 
480,"DOCTOR: Oh, is he always this cheery?"
481,

505,"(Abi's scream comes over the intercom, and Martha's phone.) "
506,FRANCINE: What was that?
507,
508,[Area 26]
509,
510,MARTHA: I've got to go. 
511,(Martha finishes the call. Korwin puts on heavy-duty protective
512,"gauntlets and a helmet, and lowers the"
513,Polaroid filter.) 
514,"MARTHA: Doctor, what were those screams?"
515,
516,[Corridor]
517,
518,DOCTOR: Concentrate on those doors. You've got to
519,keep moving

529,"SCANNELL: Oh, my God. "
530,(The image of a figure is burnt onto the metal x-ray shield.) 
531,SCANNELL: Tell me that's not Lerner. 
532,DOCTOR: Endothermic vaporisation. I've never seen one this ferocious.
533,Burn with me. 
534,SCANNELL: That's what we heard Korwin say. 
535,"McDONNELL: What? Do you think? No way. Scannell, tell him. Korwin is"
536,not a killer. He can't vaporise people. He's human! 
537,"DOCTOR: His bioscan results. Internal temperature, one hundred degrees!"
538,"Body oxygen replaced by hydrogen. Your husband hasn't been infected,"
539,he's been overwhelmed. 
540,McDONNELL: The test results are wrong. 
541,"DOCTOR: But what is it, though? A parasite? A mutagenic virus?"
542,"Something that needs a host body, but how did it get inside him? "
543,McDONNELL: Stop talking like he's some kind of experiment. 
544,DOCTOR: Where's the ship been? Have you made planet-fall recently?
545,Docked with any other vessels? Any kind of external contact at all? 
546,"McDONNELL: What is this, an interrogation? "
547,DOCTOR: We've got to stop him before he kills again. 
548,McDONNELL: We're just a cargo ship.
