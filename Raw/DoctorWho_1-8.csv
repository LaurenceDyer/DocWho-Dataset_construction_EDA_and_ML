21,of Fear  
22, [Forest] 
23,"(24 July, 1794 Two men dressed in unseasonably"
24,heavy cloaks move cautiously through the trees)Â 
25,"(Moments later, the Tardis materialises in a clearing by a meadow)"
26,
27,[Tardis]
28,
29,DOCTOR: There we are. Home. 
30,"BARBARA: Doctor, we "
31,"DOCTOR: It's all right. Chesterton made the position quite clear. Now,"
32,I have some work to do. 
33,"SUSAN: Grandfather, please. "
34,"DOCTOR: Hush, child. Say your goodbyes and remember, we shall be"
35,leaving almost immediately. 
36,IAN: Do you have to be in such a hurry? 
37,"DOCTOR: Enough time has been wasted bringing you back, young man. I"
38,have the universe to explore. 
39,SUSAN: Must you go? 
40,"BARBARA: Susan, we've visited many places together, had lots of"
41,"adventures, but you always knew we intended to return home when we"
42,could. 
43,"SUSAN: Yes, I know, but "
44,"BARBARA: Look, I know it's hard to say goodbye, but one day you'll"
45,understand why we had to. 
46,SUSAN: But Grandfather can bring you back any time now. 
47,"IAN: Don't you see, Susan, the longer we leave it the harder it'll be. "
48,(Susan hugs them then leaves) 
49,DOCTOR: Hmm. Still here? 
50,"IAN: Yes, we're waiting for you to carry out the checks. "
51,DOCTOR: Quite unnecessary. 
52,IAN: Oh is it? Are you so certain you know where we are? 
53,"DOCTOR: Certain? Of course I'm certain. If you doubt me, take a look"
54,for yourselves. 
55,(switches on the scanner.) 
56,DOCTOR: Perhaps that will satisfy you. 
57,"BARBARA: Mmm. It could be, I suppose. "
58,DOCTOR: Thank you. Obviously you're still in doubt. Let us take a
59,"longer look, through the trees, hmm? "
60,"BARBARA: Ian, look. Fields, crops, it's fully cultivated! "
61,IAN: Yes. Pity it's so dark. I can't see a sign of any buildings. 
62,"BARBARA: You know, it reminds me of a holiday I once took in Somerset. "
63,"DOCTOR: Then I expect it is Somerset, my dear. Well, if you're going,"
64,be off with you. 
65,"IAN: Look Doctor, I think it'd be better if you came with us. At least"
66,to explore. 
67,DOCTOR: It's out of the question. I refuse to leave the ship. 
68,IAN: Maybe you have succeeded. Maybe we are where you say we are. But I
69,remember an occasion when you took us home once before. 
70,"BARBARA: Yes, and we met Marco Polo. "
71,DOCTOR: Entirely different circumstances! I'm rather tired of your
72,"insinuations that I am not master of this craft. Oh, I admit, it did"
73,"develop a fault, a minor fault on one occasion, perhaps twice, but"
74,nothing I couldn't control. 
75,IAN: I know that. Of course you're in control. You're always in
76,control. And I'm sure you could revisit us at any time. 
77,DOCTOR: Very simple. Quite simple. 
78,"IAN: Exactly, quite simple. But you have your important researches to"
79,complete. You may not find the time. There's a chance that we won't
80,meet again. Don't you think it would be better if we parted under more
81,"friendly circumstances, say over a drink? "
82,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, well perhaps, since you put it that way, an hour or"
83,"two won't come amiss. Susan, bring my stick will you? "
84,"SUSAN: Yes, Grandfather? "
85,DOCTOR: I'm going to see Ian and Barbara back home safely. 
86,(Susan and the Doctor leave) 
87,"BARBARA: Well done, Ian. I say, do you think we really are home? "
88,"IAN: I don't know. Won't take us long to find out, will it? Come on."
89,
90,[Forest]
91,
92,(The Doctor locks the Tardis as the others look
93,around) 
94,DOCTOR: Well? 
95,BARBARA: Well those crops suggest a manor or farmhouse. It should be
96,reasonably close. 
97,"SUSAN: It's very warm, isn't it? It must be summertime. Ian? "
98,IAN: Yes? 
99,SUSAN: Why aren't there any lights? 
100,"IAN: That's a point. It's dusk, and we've got a very good view from"
101,here. 
102,"BARBARA: Well, towns and villages can be well-spaced, even in England. "
103,"DOCTOR: Are we going to stand here talking all night, hmm? Hmm? "
104,(there's a movement in the bushes) 
105,"IAN: All right, Susan, I saw it. Keep talking. "
106,SUSAN: All right. Be careful though. 
107,(Ian circles through the trees) 
108,BARBARA: Did you see what it was? 
109,"SUSAN: No, I didn't. "
110,"DOCTOR: Perhaps it was a rabbit. Do you know, Chesterton's getting"
111,quite jumpy these days. Young man like him shouldn't suffer from
112,nerves. 
113,(Ian reappears with a boy) 
114,"BARBARA: Well, that rabbit of yours is putting up quite a fight. Ian,"
115,you're hurting him! 
116,"IAN: Oh, no, I'm not! "
117,"DOCTOR: Come here, my boy. Where are we? Where do you live, hmm? "
118,"SUSAN: Grandfather, you're frightening him. We're your friends. Don't"
119,be afraid. 
120,BARBARA: Look at him. He's absolutely terrified. 
121,"IAN: Yes. Of us, or of something else? "
122,"DOCTOR: Come along, answer my questions, boy. "
123,"JEAN PIERRE: Please, I've done nothing. "
124,IAN: We're not going to hurt you. 
125,"BARBARA: No of course, we're not. Look, we've lost our way and we need"
126,"you help. This is England, isn't it? "
127,"JEAN PIERRE: England? No, France. "
128,"IAN: France? Well, how far from Paris? "
129,JEAN PIERRE: Not far. Twelve kilometres. 
130,"IAN: Oh, that's something, I suppose. "
131,"DOCTOR: Paris, eh? A hundred miles or so either way is to be expected."
132,"After all, it's only a fraction of the distance we've covered. It's"
133,"quite accurate, in fact. "
134,"IAN: Yes. Assuming the distance is our only error. You know, Doctor, I"
135,have a feeling you've been building up our hopes again. 
136,"DOCTOR: Oh, nonsense. Let's have a word with the boy. Now look here, my"
137,boy. Hold still 
138,(Jean Pierre makes a break for it.) 
139,IAN: We lost him. 
140,DOCTOR: You don't say. 
141,IAN: Pity. Probably knows these woods like the back of his hand. 
142,SUSAN: I wonder why he was so afraid.
143,
144,[Farm]
145,
146,(a nearby farmhouse with derelict outbuildings and
147,a crumbling stone wall. Jean Pierre knocks at the door and goes inside)
148,
149,[Track]
150,
151,"DOCTOR: Chesterton, there's a house. Look, straight"
152,ahead of us. 
153,"IAN: Yes. What do you make of it, Barbara? "
154,"BARBARA: Well, it looks deserted. You know, I'm certain we're sometime"
155,in the past. 
156,"IAN: Yes. Well, we were a hundred miles out. Perhaps we're a hundred"
157,years out. 
158,"DOCTOR: Oh, rubbish, rubbish. "
159,"BARBARA: Well, it's possible. "
160,"IAN: You know, I think we ought to get back to the ship while we still"
161,can. 
162,"DOCTOR: Nonsense. It was your idea to explore, anyway. Besides, that"
163,might be very interesting. The walk will do us good. 
164,"SUSAN: Come on, you two. You don't want to be lost in the dark. "
165,"IAN: Don't worry, we're right behind you. "
166,"BARBARA: Well, we're still not home. "
167,"IAN: No, we're not, are we? Still, I do think he tried this time, even"
168,if it was out of bad temper. 
169,BARBARA: So we stay with the ship. 
170,"IAN: Yes. Cheered Susan up, hasn't it? "
171,"BARBARA: Well, are you disappointed? "
172,"IAN: Funny enough, no. I don't know. Depends where we are. I still"
173,could be. 
174,SUSAN: Ian! Barbara! 
175,"BARBARA: Well, we'd better join the others."
176,
177,[Farmyard]
178,
179,(The Doctor and Susan go into the courtyard) 
180,DOCTOR: It looks uninhabited. I wonder if we can get in? 
181,(Ian and Barbara enter.) 
182,BARBARA: Did you find anything? 
183,SUSAN: Not yet. Grandfather's seeing if he can get in. 
184,"IAN: Oh, is he now? "
185,(The Doctor is looking through a dirty window) 
186,IAN: Doctor? 
187,"DOCTOR: I say, take a look through there, will you? I think your eyes"
188,are sharper than mine. 
189,"IAN: Too dark to see anything, Doctor. No, I don't think anyone's lived"
190,here for years. Doctor? Doctor? 
191,DOCTOR: We're in luck. The door's unlocked. 
192,[Farmhouse]
193,
194,(There are two fancy candlesticks on the table. The
195,Doctor lights the candles) 
196,DOCTOR: I'll take upstairs and you search down. 
197,IAN: All right. 
198,(The Doctor goes through the door to the stairs.) 
199,BARBARA: Where's the Doctor? 
200,IAN: He's gone upstairs. Look at this. What do you think a candlestick
201,like that's doing in a place like this? 
202,BARBARA: I don't know. 
203,IAN: Here's a tinderbox. 
204,SUSAN: Look at this! 
205,(it's a chest full of clothes) 
206,"BARBARA: Hey, this is eighteenth century. "
207,SUSAN: Look at this one! 
208,"BARBARA: You know, there's a whole wardrobe here. Look, they're all"
209,different sizes too. 
210,IAN: Look at these bundles. Bottles of wine. Bread. A bit stale. 
211,"BARBARA: There's another bundle over here. Hey, look at all these maps."
212,There's a whole bunch of daggers down here. 
213,IAN: These documents. Official documents. Undated and the name is left
214,"blank. They're passes, Barbara. "
215,"BARBARA: Yes, but nobody lives here. I mean, look at the dust"
216,everywhere. 
217,"IAN: This is a stopping-off place. A link in some escape chain. Here,"
218,look at this. 
219,"BARBARA: Ian, this is signed by Robespierre! "
220,"IAN: Robespierre? Must be a. Oh, wait a minute. The Doctor's put us"
221,down right in the middle of the French Revolution. 
222,BARBARA: Yes. The Reign of Terror.
223,"(Upstairs, the Doctor has been hit from behind and knocked out) "
224,"(Downstairs, the group are getting dressed with clothes the chest) "
225,IAN: Doctor? Doctor? 
226,BARBARA: How do I look? 
227,"IAN: Very pretty, mademoiselle. Hairstyle's a bit modern, but it's all"
228,right. It was a good idea to change into these clothes. We won't look
229,so conspicuous when we go back to the ship. 
230,SUSAN: We might not get back to the ship if Grandfather hears we're in
231,the Reign of Terror. 
232,IAN: Why not? 
233,SUSAN: It's his favourite period in the history of Earth. 
234,"IAN: Not getting very far, are we? What on Earth's he doing up there?"
235,Come on. Let's go and find him. 
236,"(there are two men in the doorway, with pistols.) "
237,ROUVRAY: Don't move. Please put that on the table. 
238,(the candlestick is put down.) 
239,ROUVRAY: Thank you. What are you doing here? 
240,"D'ARGENSON: Don't waste time, Rouvray. Kill them. They're after us. "
241,"ROUVRAY: I think not, but I would advise you to answer the question. "
242,BARBARA: We're travellers. 
243,SUSAN: We only stopped here til we could find our way. 
244,ROUVRAY: At a deserted house? 
245,D'ARGENSON: You'll gain nothing by this questioning. We should be
246,moving on! 
247,"ROUVRAY: Patience, d'Argenson, even in these troubled times our"
248,"visitors have the right of an explanation, even if our enemies do not"
249,accord such
250,privileges. 
251,"IAN: We're not your enemies. We are what we say we are, travellers. "
252,"ROUVRAY: When you entered our hideout, you entered our lives. Do you"
253,travel alone? 
254,BARBARA: Yes. 
255,"D'ARGENSON: You see, they lie! "
256,ROUVRAY: We found the old man upstairs. Do not count on his assistance.
257,
258,SUSAN: What have you done with him? 
259,ROUVRAY: At the moment he's safe. It was in your power to see that he
260,came to no harm. But your answer proves that you do not speak
261,truthfully. There is something you are concealing. 
262,IAN: It doesn't concern you. 
263,D'ARGENSON: We must be leaving now. The soldiers will have followed! 
264,ROUVRAY: In France now there are only two sides. You're either with us
265,or against us. Our sympathies are obvious. We want to know yours. 
266,"BARBARA: We appreciate what you say, but we have no side. We're not"
267,even French. 
268,ROUVRAY: A word of warning. If you intend to stay in France you will
269,have to choose. 
270,D'ARGENSON: We cannot trust them now! 
271,"ROUVRAY: If we are to escape from France, we must have faith. If all"
272,"people are incapable of our trust, we shall take the Terror with us. "
273,SUSAN: Where is my Grandfather? 
274,"ROUVRAY: The old man? D'Argenson, go. "
275,IAN: Shh! Listen. 
276,(armed men emerge from the forest) 
277,D'ARGENSON: The soldiers! They've found us! 
278,ROUVRAY: Quiet. 
279,"D'ARGENSON: But they'll take us to Paris, to the guillotine. Rouvray, I"
280,"can't, I can't let that happen. My whole family were executed, even my"
281,younger sister. They came to the house while I was out and they dragged
282,"them away. Rouvray, we must go while we have the chance! "
283,ROUVRAY: They will see us. Our only hope is to stay here and hide. They
284,may pass. 
285,IAN: They're coming in. 
286,D'ARGENSON: It will be the guillotine for all of us! 
287,"ROUVRAY: D'Argenson. D'Argenson, quiet! "
288,(Rouvray gives Ian his spare pistol.)
289,
290,[Farmyard]
291,
292,SERGEANT: (to soldiers) Wait here! The pigs will
293,still be running. They won't have stopped yet. 
294,"LIEUTENANT: This is their route according to our information, sergeant."
295,They could be hiding in this house. 
296,SERGEANT: I'll have the men search the place. 
297,"LIEUTENANT: No. No, let's let them rest. They've had a long march."
298,We'll cover the back. 
299,SERGEANT: We'll block their escape. 
300,"LIEUTENANT: If they are in there, we can let them suffer the waiting. "
301,SERGEANT: You. Round the back. 
302,"SOLDIER: Go yourself, citizen! "
303,(The other soldiers laugh.) 
304,"SERGEANT: And if they run, you'll have the chance of stopping them. "
305,SOLDIER: Yes. It's a long time since I had a royalist to myself. 
306,SERGEANT: Keep your eyes open. 
307,SOLDIER: Don't worry. They won't get past me.
308,
309,[Farmhouse]
310,
311,IAN: They're not coming in. 
312,ROUVRAY: No. The intention is to break our nerve. 
313,(as they wait) 
314,ROUVRAY: and then we were warned to leave or face arrest and execution.
315,"Friends warn us, and friends denounce us. "
316,IAN: It seems the soldiers followed you. Who knew you were taking this
317,road? 
318,ROUVRAY: Who indeed. It's difficult to have secrets these days. 
319,SUSAN: Ian. Grandfather. 
320,ROUVRAY: The old man? He's upstairs somewhere. D'Argenson? You dealt
321,with him. 
322,IAN: Never mind. I'll find him. 
323,(Ian goes upstairs and D'Argenson runs for the door) 
324,ROUVRAY: D'Argenson! Come back! You fool! 
325,[Farmyard]
326,
327,(D'Argenson is surrounded. No one notices Rouvray
328,until) 
329,LIEUTENANT: Sergeant! Rouvray. 
330,ROUVRAY: Don't move! And get away from that man. 
331,LIEUTENANT: Take him! 
332,ROUVRAY: You'll listen to me! 
333,(he steps in front of D'Argenson) 
334,"LIEUTENANT: So Rouvray, your voice still carries authority, even to my"
335,soldiers. 
336,ROUVRAY: You. Come here. Give it to me. 
337,(he takes a musket from a soldier and throws it away) 
338,"ROUVRAY: You can give them uniforms, Lieutenant, but they remain"
339,peasants underneath. 
340,(another soldier shoots Rouvray) 
341,SOLDIER: Let's get the other one! Hold him! Hold him! 
342,(D'Argenson is grabbed. The Lieutenant checks Rouvray's body) 
343,"LIEUTENANT: A desperate attempt, and it very nearly worked. "
344,"(the soldiers shoot D'Argenson, and laugh)"
345,
346,"[Farmhouse, upstairs]"
347,
348,IAN: Doctor? Doctor? Where are you? 
349,(The Doctor is still out cold in a locked room. Susan screams and Ian
350,goes downstairs) 
351,[Farmhouse]
352,
353,(Ian is caught by the soldiers and disarmed) 
354,LIEUTENANT: My sergeant was right. It did pay us to look in the house. 
355,IAN: We are not 
356,"LIEUTENANT: Silence! If any of them speak again without permission,"
357,shoot them. 
358,"SERGEANT: The bodies have been removed, Lieutenant. What about these? "
359,LIEUTENANT: Outside. 
360,"SERGEANT: Go on, you heard the Lieutenant, move! "
361,SOLDIER: Outside into the courtyard. 
362,"(Upstairs, the Doctor is waking up)"
363,
364,[Farmyard]
365,
366,"(Ian, Susan and Barbara are lined up against a wall"
367,in front of a firing squad) 
368,SERGEANT: Load muskets! 
369,SOLDIER: We already have. Get out the way. 
370,LIEUTENANT: Stop. We take them to Paris. 
371,"SOLDIER: No, we'll shoot them here. "
372,LIEUTENANT: We've got the men we came for. 
373,"SOLDIER: Yes, and more. I say we kill them. "
374,LIEUTENANT: Now listen. Listen. We also want credit for our additional
375,prisoners. LeMaitre may not believe us if he doesn't see them for
376,himself. 
377,SOLDIER: That's true. 
378,SERGEANT: But there may be a reward. 
379,"SOLDIER: The sergeant's right, perhaps there is a reward. "
380,"LIEUTENANT: And besides, why should we do what Madame Guillotine can do"
381,so much better? 
382,SOLDIER: Let's take them to Paris. To the guillotine! 
383,(they untie the prisoner's feet) 
384,SOLDIER: Move! 
385,"(Ian, Susan and Barbara are lead away) "
386,SERGEANT: Wait. We'll burn the house down! 
387,"(He throws a burning torch into the hay loft, and others follow his"
388,example. Soon the house itself catches fire) 
389,"[Farmhouse, upstairs]"
390,
391,"(The Doctor is surrounded by smoke, and thumps on"
392,the door)
393,DOCTOR: Help! Can you hear me? 
394,[Forest]
395,
396,SUSAN: Is there really no sign of him? 
397,BARBARA: The house! Look at the house! 
398,SUSAN: What about Grandfather? 
399,"BARBARA: I'm sure he got out, Susan. "
400,"IAN: I hope so, for all our sakes. "
401,SOLDIER: Get moving! 
402,"(when they've gone, the boy Jean-Pierre comes out of the bushes)"
403,
404,"[Farmhouse, upstairs]"
405,
406,DOCTOR: Hello! Hello! Can you hear me? Get me out! 
407,"(the smoke gets to him, and the roof begins to fall in)"

412,[Office]
413,
414,"(Paris, 25 July 1794, morning, at Conciergerie"
415,Prison)
416,BARBARA: Are we to be allowed to tell our story? 
417,JUDGE: Prisoners are not required to speak. I have the charges here.
418,You were found in the house with Rouvray and D'Argenson and arrested by
419,a platoon of soldiers. I am satisfied as to your guilt as being in the
420,"company of wanted traitors. The sentence, immediate execution. "
421,BARBARA: We demand the right to speak. 
422,JUDGE: You have no rights! You will be guillotined as soon as it can be
423,arranged. Take them to the cells! 
424,[Jail corridor]
425,
426,(Ian is put into a cell with another man) 
427,"JAILER: Stay back, by the wall. "
428,BARBARA: Ian! 
429,SUSAN: Ian!
430,"JAILER: Go away. Keep hold of her, can't you? (to Ian) I told you to"
431,stay back by the wall. There's nothing to interest you. 
432,"(further along, down some steps) "
433,JAILER: Stay with her over there. Lady like you shouldn't be kept in
434,"this pig sty. Course, I have the keys. It wouldn't be very difficult to"
435,"leave a few doors open, now, would it? "
436,"BARBARA: No, of course not. But I couldn't pay you. I don't have any"
437,money. 
438,"JAILER: The soldiers in this place, they're nothing but peasants. Not"
439,fit company for an intelligent man like myself. Gets very lonely in
440,"here sometimes. Very lonely indeed. Now, if we were to be friends, eh? "
441,(Barbara slaps him across the face)
442,"JAILER: You'll regret that! I promise you. Here! Lock them away. No, in"
443,there. It's the cell I keep for my special guests.
444,
445,[Woman's cell]
446,
447,"(straw on the floor, one bunk and a high barred"
448,window) 
449,"SUSAN: The smell in here. Oh, it's terrible! "
450,"BARBARA: Yes, it reminds me of when we were prisoners before, in the"
451,prehistoric age. 
452,"SUSAN: Oh, yes. I remember that. But there was one very important"
453,difference. Grandfather and Ian were with us then. I wish I could see
454,"where we were. Oh. You'll have to lift me up, Barbara. Barbara? "

916,BARBARA: All right. I don't even know your name. 
917,JULES: And that is another of my rules. Christian names only. The less

949,BARBARA: Jules?

956,"BARBARA: Yes, let's see. Forest should be in this area, here. "
957,"SUSAN: Yes, And there was a group of houses, wasn't there? "
958,BARBARA: Yes. 
959,SUSAN: Yes. That would be the forest. 
960,"BARBARA: Yes, turn it round this way. "
961,SUSAN: Okay. 
962,"BARBARA: Jules, I think we can show you now. We arrived in this area"
963,here. 
964,"SUSAN: Yes, we walked through the forest, you see. Then we got lost. So"
965,we asked our way at a house and. Where was the house? 
966,BARBARA: Here it is. 
967,SUSAN: Ah. 
968,"BARBARA: That's where we saw the soldiers, remember? "

981,BARBARA: D'Argenson. 
982,JULES: And Rouvray. 
983,"JEAN: They must have discovered our escape route, Jules. "
984,JULES: They may have just been unlucky. We'll wait till we've heard
985,from Leon. The route is his responsibility. Were d'Argenson and Rouvray
986,brought back with you? 
987,BARBARA: No. There was a fight with the soldiers. They were shot. 
988,"JEAN: Soldiers? Jules, this isn't the first time. "
989,"JULES: Oh, later, later. "
990,JEAN: Someone's informing on us. 
991,"JULES: Later, Jean. "
992,"SUSAN: You knew those men, didn't you? "
993,"JULES: Hmm? Yes. Yes, we did. We rescued them as we did you. In their"
994,case our effort was wasted. 
995,BARBARA: So this isn't the first time you've risked your life? 
996,JEAN: Not all Frenchmen can allow innocent people to be led to the
997,"guillotine, Barbara. Jules has saved many lives. "
998,JULES: It would appear that my that luck is running out. 
999,JEAN: Luck? Not if what I say is true. 
1000,"JULES: I shall sort it out, Jean. Now, you say your Grandfather was"
1001,left here. 
1002,"SUSAN: Yes, in that house. "
1003,JULES: Then I shall send someone to search for him as soon as I can. 
1004,"BARBARA: There were four of us all together. Ian, as I've already told"
1005,"you, is still in the prison. "
1006,"JULES: I promise you, I give you my word, that I will not rest until"
1007,the four of you have been brought together again. 
1008,BARBARA: Headache again? 
1009,"SUSAN: Ah, yes. It keeps coming and going. "
1010,JULES: The young lady needs sleep. Danielle?

1012,JULES: Danielle will escort you.

1022,JULES: Leon! It's good to see you. 
1023,JEAN: D'Argenson and Rouvray were taken. 
1024,"JULES: Not now, Jean. Well Leon, what's wrong? "
1025,LEON: There is a man. A stranger. He's been asking for you. 
1026,JULES: Oh? 
1027,LEON: He's being watched. He's by the inn near the prison. We thought
1028,you should know. 
1029,"JULES: Yes, thank you. We'll take care of it. "
1030,"JULES: Oh Barbara, this is a good friend of mine, Leon. Barbara. She's"

1061,"JAILER: Robespierre? Why, I don't think you should worry the first"

1063,Anything you wish to know. 
1064,DOCTOR: Very well. Very well. Thank you. Yes. You seem a capable man
1065,and I'm sure this misunderstanding is none of your doing. 
1066,"JAILER: Oh, indeed citizen. I am most conscientious, but when you're"

1075,"JAILER: Ah, yes. Ah, yes. Er. "
1076,DOCTOR: Well? If they're still here. 
1077,"JAILER: The women were dispatched to the guillotine. Unfortunately,"
1078,there was a rescue. 
1079,DOCTOR: What? By whom? 
1080,JAILER: We don't know! Many times traitors have been snatched away on
1081,"the road to the guillotine. You understand, of course, that I cannot be"

1091,escape. But he fought with the strength of ten men. 
1092,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, I believe what you say. I'm sure you did the"
1093,best you could. It's a pity you're surrounded by such fools.

1156,DOCTOR: Just today. 
1157,ROBESPIERRE: Hardly long enough for you to have gauged the present mood
1158,of our capital. 
1159,"DOCTOR: Oh, I wouldn't say that. "
1160,ROBESPIERRE: I am only interested in your comments on your own
1161,territory. Recent memoranda from your province suggest that the purge
1162,of our enemies in your region is progressing very slowly. 
1163,"DOCTOR: Oh, you've reached that conclusion. Hmm. Well, perhaps we have"
1164,"fewer enemies in our region, and it maybe that Paris can take an"
1165,"example from us, hmm? "
1166,"ROBESPIERRE: We in Paris are aware of the danger, Citizen. We live in"
1167,"troubled times. There is much, much work to be done, work that is"

1169,harbour in our midst.

1171,can this reign of terror possibly gain? For every opponent you put to
1172,"the guillotine, two more will spring up! "
1173,"LEMAITRE: I think you have said enough, Citizen. "
1174,"DOCTOR: Oh, you do, do you? "
1175,"ROBESPIERRE: Let him speak, LeMaitre. What he said is true. My enemies"
1176,do multiply. He is only warning me of the dangers I face. 
1177,"LEMAITRE: As you wish, Citizen. "
1178,"ROBESPIERRE: I could, and I shall, do great things for France. For too"
1179,"long the Nobility have kept our people to heel. And now finally, my"
1180,"world is at power, what happens? My colleagues, my trusted friends,"
1181,plot for power. 
1182,"DOCTOR: Do they? Or is it just their wish to keep their heads, hmm? "
1183,"ROBESPIERRE: Danton planned to restore the monarchy. I had the proof, I"
1184,"knew! I had to dispose of him. And the Girondins. Even now, Convention"
1185,"members are at work, plotting my downfall. But I will triumph, even if"
1186,"I have to execute every last one of them! Death, always death. Do you"
1187,think I want this carnage? Three hundred and forty two executions in
1188,nine days in Paris alone. What a memory I shall leave behind if this

1322,"TAILOR: And the sash, Citizen. It was when he took the insignia of a"
1323,"Regional Officer of the Provinces that I became, well, suspicious. "
1324,"LEMAITRE: Yes, so you said. "
1325,"TAILOR: Of course I realise it may be nothing, but it was my duty to"
1326,report it. 
1327,"LEMAITRE: You did well, Citizen. "
1328,"TAILOR: Will you be keeping the ring and the clothes, Citizen? "
1329,LEMAITRE: They may be needed as evidence. 
1330,"TAILOR: Oh. Yes. Of course, you realise they were part of the exchange."
1331,"I'm a poor man, Citizen, and normally I'd have thrown him out of my"

1350,"BARBARA: Oh, she has a slight fever, but she's sleeping now. "

1352,"BARBARA: No, he had to leave. He's arranging for Susan to see a doctor"

1359,Doctor? 
1360,BARBARA: No. We don't even know if he got to Paris. 
1361,"JULES: Well, we did not know when we left here we were going to collect"

1363,"BARBARA: Ian, this is Jules. He saved our lives. "
1364,"IAN: Not Jules Renan, by any chance? "
1365,JULES: Yes? 
1366,IAN: What? I've been looking for you. 
1367,JULES: We heard that somebody was. We did not know it was you. 
1368,IAN: You can say that again. 
1369,"JULES: We're very sorry about that. Jean, this calls for a celebration."
1370,
1371,JEAN: I'll get a bottle from the cellar. 
1372,"JULES: Come and sit over here, you'll be more comfortable. "
1373,BARBARA: I think I'd better go and sit with Susan. 
1374,IAN: Oh? 
1375,BARBARA: She isn't feeling at all well. 
1376,IAN: What's wrong with her? 
1377,BARBARA: Don't know. We're hoping to see a doctor tomorrow. Although
1378,"when she hears you're back, that should be tonic enough. "
1379,"JULES: I know it is good news, but I think it's best not to wake her. "
1380,"BARBARA: Oh no, I won't. She doesn't sleep for very long anyway. Look,"
1381,you have a talk to Ian. 
1382,(Barbara leaves) 
1383,IAN: Sounded like an order. 
1384,"JULES: Well, there is one question I would like to ask you. How did you"
1385,know Barbara and Susan were here? 
1386,IAN: I didn't. 
1387,JULES: But I thought when you were asking for me. 
1388,IAN: That was for an entirely different reason. Do you know a man
1389,called Webster? 
1390,JULES: No. 
1391,IAN: I shared a cell with him in prison. Unfortunately he died. He
1392,asked me to contact a man called James Stirling. 
1393,"JULES: James Stirling. No, I'm afraid that name means nothing to me"
1394,either. 
1395,IAN: What? You mean to say you don't know him? 
1396,JULES: No. Should I? 
1397,"IAN: Well, I don't know. I somehow took it for granted that you would. "
1398,JULES: Perhaps you'd better tell me the complete story. 
1399,IAN: Yes. 
1400,JULES: Over a glass of wine. 
1401,"IAN: Well, as far as I know, Webster was an Englishman who'd come over"
1402,to France to persuade Stirling to return to England. Stirling must be a
1403,spy. 
1404,"JEAN: I'll share one drink, then I must start my journey. "
1405,"JULES: Thank you. Yes, you should leave before dawn. Your health, Ian. "
1406,"IAN: Well, as I told you, Webster was dying. But before he died, he"
1407,"begged me to get a message to James Stirling. I asked him, how would I"
1408,recognise him? And he told me to contact you at the sign of Le Chien
1409,Gris. 
1410,"JEAN: I see. Well, Webster is right there. It is an inn that we"
1411,"frequent. I'm sorry, please go on. "
1412,"IAN: No, that's all there is to say. Except that, as I found Le Chien"
1413,"Gris, you found me. "
1414,JULES: Did Webster know Stirling? 
1415,"IAN: Oh, I imagine so. "
1416,JEAN: Probably by sight. 
1417,"JULES: But if as you say Stirling is a spy, to do his job properly he"
1418,"must be able to move around freely. That would mean an alias, a"
1419,completely new identity. 
1420,"IAN: What, something that Webster didn't know? "
1421,"JULES: Yes, exactly. "
1422,IAN: So Webster was counting on recognising him? 
1423,"JULES: Well, that makes good sense. "
1424,"IAN: Yes, well why did he ask me to contact you? "
1425,JULES: Men like Webster have been in touch with me before. I imagine
1426,the English are giving me as a contact to people they send over in case
1427,they need help. 
1428,"IAN: That's not going to help me find Stirling, is it? "
1429,"JULES: What's the matter, eh? "
1430,JEAN: I'm not sure I like the idea of being used by the English. You
1431,"shouldn't either, Jules. We're at war! And they're our enemies, and"
1432,here we are helping their spies. 
1433,"JULES: England is at war with the people ruling France, Jean. So are"
1434,"we. When the tyranny ends, so will the war. "
1435,IAN: I suppose the chances of finding Stirling are pretty slim. 
1436,JULES: We can try. 
1437,IAN: Good. 
1438,"JEAN: Now, you have a few days to spare, if that's correct. "
1439,"IAN: Oh, do I? "
1440,"JULES: Oh, I'm sorry, I haven't told you. Jean is leaving soon to"
1441,"search for the fourth member of your party, Susan's grandfather. "
1442,IAN: You know where he is? 
1443,"JULES: No, but he will start at the house where you were arrested and"
1444,"follow the trail from there, won't you, Jean? "
1445,"JEAN: Yes, I will find him. "
1446,"JULES: And while we wait, we will also search, for Stirling. "
1447,"JEAN: Providing you have no objections, Jules, I'll start my journey"
1448,now. 
1449,JULES: No objections. 
1450,JEAN: You'll hear from me within three days. 
1451,"JULES: Take care, Jean. "
1452,JEAN: Ian. 
1453,"IAN: Good luck, and thanks. "
1454,"JULES: If anyone can find him, Jean can. Now to our problem. I wonder"
1455,who can help us? 
1456,"JEAN: Of course, there is one man. "
1457,JULES: Leon? 
1458,IAN: A friend of yours? 
1459,JULES: We've shared many escapades. He moves in a very wide circle and
1460,knows a great many people. Perhaps he is James Stirling? 
1461,(Jean leaves) 
1462,IAN: I'd like to meet him. Can you arrange it? 
1463,"JULES: Very easily, he's coming here tomorrow, bringing a physician for"
1464,Susan.

1730,DOCTOR: Perhaps what? 
1731,"JAILER: Well, if she were to escape, she could be followed. She'd meet"
1732,"these traitors, then we'd arrest them. LeMaitre once did this. "
1733,"DOCTOR: My dear, what an excellent idea! What an excellent idea! Yes,"
1734,"of course, now why didn't I think of that? Yes, that's what we'll do,"
1735,"and LeMaitre will be delighted! Now look here, Mister Jailer, I want"
1736,you to open those prison doors. Keep out of sight. 
1737,"JAILER: Oh, but, er "

1752,"leaves them alone, lets them think. Now me, I have other ways. "
1753,LEON: Stop that. I'm sorry. I'm afraid my men are very bad-tempered.
1754,"Ian, I don't want anything to happen to you really, but I think you"
1755,have the information that will help the cause I believe in. 
1756,IAN: You're wasting your time with me. I'm very small fry. 
1757,LEON: Surely you don't expect me to believe that? We learned of the
1758,existence of James Stirling two months ago. We've been searching for
1759,him ever since. 
1760,IAN: We? 
1761,LEON: Yes. I've been loyal to the Revolution from the beginning. If
1762,"you'd known what France was like six years ago, before the Bastille,"
1763,you'd understand. 
1764,"IAN: I do understand, but I can't help you. "
1765,LEON: Or you won't. France will never be anything until we're rid of
1766,these high-born leeches who've been sucking the life-blood of France
1767,for so long. 
1768,"IAN: You must believe me, I can help you in no way. "
1769,LEON: Ian. You can save yourself a lot of trouble and suffering by
1770,talking. This is your only chance! Do you realise that when I've
1771,"finished with you I'll transfer you to the prison, and then to the"
1772,"guillotine? Now, if you were to talk, I have the power to set you free."
1773,

1778,here.

1782,you?

1786,Save yourself from the guillotine. 
1787,IAN: You wouldn't believe my story anyway.

2130,STIRLING: She already has been out of that prison and she was
2131,rearrested. I will help you if you will help me. Don't you see? I can
2132,use my authority to get safe passage for all of you to wherever you
2133,want to go. 
2134,DOCTOR: But look here. 
2135,"IAN: He's right, Doctor. "
2136,"STIRLING: No harm will come to Susan, I promise. I gave orders that she"
2137,was to remain in the cell. Now you know that's true. The jailer would
2138,die rather than see that cell door opened again. 
2139,"DOCTOR: Very well. Very well. If you must, tell your story then get on"
2140,with it. 
2141,"STIRLING: First, the message. "
2142,"IAN: Oh, Webster said very little. He was badly wounded as you know. "
2143,STIRLING: Yes. I know that. I read reports of all arrests in case
2144,"something like this happens. It's why I came to your cell, I realised"
2145,that he could have been Webster. I've been expecting to be contacted
2146,for months. 
2147,"IAN: He didn't know where you were, or even where I could find you. "
2148,STIRLING: No. The plan was that he was to look for and recognise me. He
2149,"was a good friend. Ian, the message? "
2150,IAN: He said you were to return to England immediately. It seems that
2151,whatever information you have is wanted there urgently. 
2152,STIRLING: Nothing more? 
2153,IAN: That was all Webster said. 
2154,STIRLING: Are you sure? 
2155,"IAN: Well, he mumbled occasionally. Odd words. But what I've just told"
2156,you was all he asked me to tell you. 
2157,STIRLING: What were these mumblings about? 
2158,"IAN: Oh, well, they didn't really make sense. He was unconscious. He"
2159,said strange things. I can't really remember now. 
2160,STIRLING: He may have realised that he didn't have very much time. 
2161,IAN: Yes. I'm afraid I can't remember them. 
2162,"STIRLING: Well, I'm already planning my return to England, but before I"
2163,"go, and before I can give Susan and you safe passage, there is one more"
2164,piece of information I must have. 
2165,BARBARA: But you asked for our help. What can we do? You have all the
2166,power. 
2167,STIRLING: Robespierre sent for me today. There is another plot to
2168,depose him. 
2169,"JULES: Good. Will it succeed, do you think? "
2170,"STIRLING: Possibly. He gave orders that I should follow Paul Barrass, a"
2171,"deputy, and report back on a meeting. "
2172,IAN: Barrass. Meeting. Webster did speak of that. 
2173,STIRLING: What did he say? 
2174,"IAN: Well, nothing specific but he said Barrass, meeting, and something"
2175,"about a sinking ship. No. No, The Sinking Ship. That was it! "
2176,JULES: Just a moment. There's an inn called the Sinking Ship on the
2177,Calais Road. It would be ideal for a secret meeting. 
2178,"STIRLING: Right. Better than following him, we can plan a reception"
2179,"committee. If I can discover the results of this meeting, I'm ready to"
2180,return to England and I'm free to help you. 
2181,BARBARA: Have you any idea who Barrass is meeting? 
2182,"STIRLING: No, but whoever he is, he could be the next ruler of France. "
2183,IAN: I still don't understand why you need our help. 
2184,"STIRLING: Barrass knows me by sight, I'm sure of that. He could even"
2185,"know of you, Doctor. Now my plan, if you agree, is for Barbara and Ian"
2186,to attend the meeting. 
2187,DOCTOR: Nonsense! It's far too risky. 
2188,JULES: Why not use your own men? You would still learn the details. 
2189,STIRLING: True but then they would also know and they may talk. Then I
2190,have no advantage. 
2191,BARBARA: I think we should go. Ian? 
2192,"IAN: It's risky, but we're not going to get away without help. "
2193,"DOCTOR: Quite so, and there's Susan to think about. "
2194,STIRLING: Then you agree to go? 
2195,BARBARA: Yes. 
2196,IAN: We agree. 
2197,STIRLING: The Doctor and I will remain here. If we're seen it could
2198,"hinder you, or worse. "
2199,"JULES: I'll take them to the inn, Stirling, if you've no objection. "
2200,"STIRLING: Good. I was going to ask you to. Now, when you get there I"
2201,suggest that the innkeeper. 
2202,"JULES: You can leave it to us, Stirling. "
2203,STIRLING: Sorry. I know I can. You should have little difficulty
2204,getting there tonight. Stay the night and return here tomorrow morning.
2205,"That way you won't run into any patrols. Now, where exactly is this"
2206,"inn, Jules? "
2207,JULES: It's a good two hours ride. We'll take the Calais road and ride
2208,due north. When we reach this fork we'll see a forest. We'll circle it
2209,and ride west.

2283,NAPOLEON: The meeting place was well chosen. 
2284,"BARRASS: I, er, assume from your presence here that you're interested"
2285,in my proposition. 
2286,"NAPOLEON: Interested, obviously. But, no more. At least, not until you"
2287,disclose the full details. 
2288,BARRASS: Robespierre will be arrested after tomorrow's convention
2289,meeting. 
2290,NAPOLEON: Will be? It won't be the first attempt. 
2291,BARRASS: But it will be the successful one. He'll be tried and executed
2292,before his friends have time to reorganise. 
2293,"NAPOLEON: You make it sound simple, Barrass. I think you underestimate"
2294,Robespierre. He has a talent for commanding support. 
2295,BARRASS: Only if he is allowed to speak. And he won't be able to. 
2296,"NAPOLEON: As far as I'm concerned, your success or failure means very"
2297,little to me. 
2298,"BARRASS: Oh, possibly, but only for the immediate future. Success could"
2299,well mean that I would take control of the governing
2300,committee. 
2301,NAPOLEON: It would be within the constitutional rights? 
2302,"BARRASS: And then the constitution could be amended. Oh, I'm well aware"
2303,of your disgust for
2304,"politicians, tearing France to pieces while her enemies wait to pounce."
2305,
2306,NAPOLEON: Exactly what is your proposal? 
2307,"BARRASS: I believe that to rule a country successfully, one needs a"
2308,certain support from the people being governed. 
2309,NAPOLEON: Agreed. And how do you plan to raise that support? 
2310,"BARRASS: With you. Your victories, inspiring victories, in the Austrian"
2311,Wars have made you a public figure. You're a hero in the people's eyes.
2312,
2313,NAPOLEON: And in your eyes? A useful prop for your new government. 
2314,"BARRASS: Oh, come, general. You would be more than just a figurehead. "
2315,"NAPOLEON: Yes, I know I would. I'm glad you appreciate it. In which"
2316,capacity would you require me to serve? 
2317,(Ian and Barbara are listening through the spy hole Ian made earlier) 
2318,BARRAS: The constitution amendment would call for a government of three
2319,consuls. You would be one of them. 
2320,NAPOLEON: When would you require my decision? 
2321,BARRASS: Now. 
2322,NAPOLEON: If I refuse? 
2323,"BARRASS: You're in a strong position, Bonaparte, but hardly"
2324,indispensible. There are other young men equally ambitious. 
2325,"NAPOLEON: I accept, dependent on Robespierre's downfall. In the event"
2326,"of failure, I shall of course deny this meeting ever took place. "
2327,BARRASS: I will summon you to Paris as soon as a suitable time has
2328,elapsed.

2333,"(Next morning, Ian and Barbara report their"

2335,STIRLING: Napoleon? Napoleon as ruler of France? 
2336,BARBARA: Yes. As one of three consuls. 
2337,STIRLING: He won't be content with that. I've watched his promotions.
2338,"Bonaparte's clever and ambitious. If he gets a foothold to power, one"
2339,day he will rule France. 
2340,DOCTOR: Our only concern now is Susan. 
2341,"STIRLING: She's only part of it, Doctor. If they take Robespierre to"
2342,"the prison we might find it hard to get in there, let alone get out. "
2343,IAN: You made a bargain with us. 
2344,STIRLING: And I'll keep to it. 
2345,IAN: You knew this might happen. 
2346,STIRLING: Yes. But I had no idea Barrass was so strong. Jules. What
2347,time is this convention meeting? 
2348,JULES: It will be over by now. 
2349,STIRLING: Then Robespierre could already be under arrest. I must find
2350,out. There may still be time. 
2351,BARBARA: You'd keep Robespierre as ruler of France? 
2352,STIRLING: If I thought it was the only way to 
2353,"JULES: We need a strong government, but not a military dictatorship."
2354,And it could happen. 
2355,BARBARA: It will happen.

2357,off for Susan.

2360,STIRLING: Take Barbara with you. Let her hide outside the prison.
2361,Jules? 
2362,JULES: Yes?

2364,wait until they disperse. Barbara will watch out for you. 
2365,JULES: Right.

2367,the carriage. Ian and myself will join you as soon as we can. 
2368,IAN: Where shall we go? 
2369,STIRLING: To the palace. We'll get news of Robespierre. If you're not
2370,"outside the prison when we return, I'll come for you. "
2371,"DOCTOR: Go with him, my boy. You can't help me but at least you can"
2372,make sure that he helps us. 
2373,IAN: All right. I'll see you outside the prison. Good luck. 
2374,"BARBARA: Take care, Ian. "
2375,"DOCTOR: What is it? What do you find so amusing, hmm? "
2376,"BARBARA: Oh, I don't know. Yes, I do. It's this feverish activity to"
2377,try and stop something that we know is going to happen. Robespierre
2378,will be guillotined whatever we do. 
2379,DOCTOR: I've told you of our position so often. 
2380,"BARBARA: Yes, I know. You can't influence or change history. I learnt"
2381,that lesson with the Aztecs. 
2382,"DOCTOR: The events will happen, just as they are written. I'm afraid so"
2383,and we can't stem the tide. But at least we can stop being carried away

2537,"STIRLING: Well, if you're certain that's where you want to be left. "
2538,BARBARA: That's the place. We'll be safe there. 
2539,"STIRLING: Yes, but I don't "
2540,BARBARA: Please. No questions. Promise? 
2541,"STIRLING: Very well, if that's what you want. Now that I'm going home,"
2542,I just can't wait to see England again. 
2543,"BARBARA: Oh, England. I know how you feel only too well. "
2544,STIRLING: Why don't you all come with me? 
2545,"BARBARA: Er, no. We must travel our way. "
2546,"STIRLING: Barbara, who are you really? Where do you all come from? "
2547,JULES: Here they are! 
2548,IAN: He's got Susan! 
2549,SUSAN: Ian! 
2550,DOCTOR: Now come along. Don't stand around. It's too dangerous. 
2551,IAN: Come along. Hurry. 
2552,JULES: Come LeMaitre. We mustn't keep them waiting. I hope they have a
2553,pleasant journey. 
2554,"STIRLING: So do I. But to where, Jules? Funny, I get the impression"
2555,"they don't know where they're heading for. Come to that, do any of us?"

2559,"DOCTOR: Well, I can assure you, my dear Barbara,"
2560,Napoleon would never have believed you. 
2561,"IAN: Yes, Doctor, but supposing we had written Napoleon a letter,"
2562,"telling him, you know, some of the things that were going to happen to"
2563,him. 
2564,"SUSAN: It wouldn't have made any difference, Ian. He'd have forgotten"
2565,"it, or lost it, or thought it was written by a maniac. "
2566,"BARBARA: I suppose if we'd tried to kill him with a gun, the bullet"
2567,would have missed him. 
2568,"DOCTOR: Well, it's hardly fair to speculate, is it? No, I'm afraid you"
2569,"belittle things. Our lives are important, at least to us. But as we"
2570,"see, so we learn. "
2571,"IAN: And what are we going to see and learn next, Doctor? "
2572,"DOCTOR: Well, unlike the old adage, my boy, our destiny is in the"
2573,"stars, so let's go and search for it."
