22,
23,(A Corporal is walking through the undergrowth of
24,"Tubney Wood as if in a trance. He stares blankly ahead, and his right"
25,"arm twitches from time to time. After he has passed, the Tardis"
26,materialises in a small clearing by a clump of purple loose-strife and
27,some oak saplings. The Doctor steps out and takes a drink from a small
28,bottle.) 
29,"SARAH : Well, come on, make your mind up. Has the Tardis brought us"
30,home or not? 
31,DOCTOR: Possibly. 
32,(Sarah comes out of the Tardis and shuts the door.) 
33,"SARAH: What do you mean, possibly. "
34,"DOCTOR: Well, the coordinates were set for your time, but the linear"
35,"calculator, well. Ginger pop? "
36,"SARAH: Can't stand the stuff, thanks all the same. So we could be"
37,"anytime, anywhere? "
38,DOCTOR: I really must get the Tardis seen to. She's way overdue her
39,five hundred year service. 
40,"SARAH: Well, at least we're on Earth. I mean, just taste that air. I"
41,love that fresh smell just after a rain shower. 
42,"DOCTOR: Yes, it does have that peculiar earthy smell. Which is odd when"
43,you look at the ground. 
44,SARAH: Hmm? 
45,DOCTOR: It's bone dry. Can't have been any rain here for more than a
46,week. 
47,(The Doctor takes a small device out of his pocket. It beeps.) 
48,DOCTOR: Now I wonder what could be causing that. 
49,SARAH: What? 
50,DOCTOR: Some enormous release of energy. 
51,"SARAH: We are on Earth, aren't we? "
52,"DOCTOR: Well, unless someone's started exporting acorns. Oak trees"
53,don't grow anywhere else in the Galaxy. 
54,"SARAH: Bet we're miles away from UNIT HQ though. So, what are we going"
55,to do? 
56,(The Doctor calls off the points of the compass.) 
57,"DOCTOR: Eenie, meenie, minie, mo? "
58,(They head off in the same direction as the soldier.) 
59,DOCTOR: Watch the bramble. 
60,SARAH: Ow. 
61,DOCTOR: I told you to watch the bramble. 
62,"SARAH: Listen, what's so special about eenie meenie minie mo? "
63,DOCTOR: Nothing. It could just as easily have be fum fo fee fi. 
64,SARAH: Fee fi fo fum. 
65,"(The Doctor and Sarah walk out of sight, and the twitching soldier"
66,"reappears, walking off at ninety degrees to their direction. Later - ) "
67,SARAH: Hang on. I thought I saw someone. 
68,(Four figures in white protective suits and helmets come out of the
69,trees ahead.) 
70,DOCTOR: Let's hope they're not strangers here themselves. Hello there! 
71,"SARAH: No. Wait, Doctor. I don't like the look of them. "
72,DOCTOR: What? Please excuse me. Could you be very kind and tell me
73,where we are? 
74,(The figures raise their right arms and point at the Doctor. The
75,"fingers are guns, and they work. Sarah and the Doctor run for cover in"
76,the trees. The figures follow.) 
77,DOCTOR: I thought it was odd. Didn't you think it was odd? I remember
78,"once at the battle of Malplaquet, I said to the Duke of Marlborough "
79,"SARAH: Oh, come on, Doctor! Let's get out of here! Argh! "
80,(Sarah disappears into a growth of bracken and ends up rolling down a
81,slope towards a steep cliff. She manages to grab on to the edge.) 
82,DOCTOR: Sarah! Don't look down! 
83,(The Doctor gets to her and pulls her back to safety.) 
84,SARAH: Thanks. 
85,DOCTOR: My pleasure. Couldn't leave you hanging around in a place like
86,this. 
87,(They see the twitching soldier moving rapidly towards the cliff edge.)
88,
89,"DOCTOR: Stop, man. Stop! "
90,SARAH: No! No! 
91,(The soldier goes flying over the edge. The Doctor and Sarah find a
92,safe route down and go to check on him.) 
93, [Quarry] 
94, DOCTOR: He must have died instantly. 
95,(Sarah picks up his beret badge.) 
96,SARAH: Look. He's from UNIT. 
97,(The Doctor checks his wallet.) 
98,DOCTOR: Look at these. 
99,(The Doctor gives Sarah a handful of coins.) 
100,SARAH: They're all new.Â 
101,"DOCTOR: Freshly minted. No scratches, tarnish. "
102,SARAH: And all dated the same year. 
103,DOCTOR: What are the odds against finding a pocket full of coins all
104,dated the same? 
105,SARAH: I don't understand it. 
106,"DOCTOR: No. Nor do I, yet. "
107,"(The Doctor has spotted a strange object nearby. Longer than a man,"
108,"black, egg-shaped, marked into quarters.) "
109,"SARAH: Oh, come on, Doctor. It's just a load of old junk. "
110,"DOCTOR: No, no, shush, wait, wait. I've seen something like this"
111,"before. My memory's getting terrible. You know, three hundred years ago"
112,I'd have recognised this like a shot. 
113,(Weapons fire. The Doctor falls.) 
114,SARAH: Doctor! 
115,DOCTOR: Keep down! 
116,(They take cover behind the artefact. The Doctor looks round the end to
117,see two of the figures. Another shot.) 
118,DOCTOR: Something seems to have annoyed them again. Come on. 
119,"(They run off and up a slope to a cornfield, then along the margins as"
120,"the figures try to pursue, but stop at the field and turn back.)"
121,
122, [Village] 
123," (The Doctor and Sarah enter a rural village,"
124,played by East Hagbourne.) 
125,"DOCTOR: Well, well. Well, well. "
126,SARAH: Devesham. 
127,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
128,(The place is deserted.) 
129,"SARAH: Doctor, we're at Devesham. "
130,DOCTOR: Do you know it? 
131,SARAH: I came here on a story about two years ago. 
132,DOCTOR: It's a bit quiet. 
133,SARAH: Yes. 
134,(The Doctor goes up the steps of the stone cross in the middle of the
135,roads.) 
136,DOCTOR: Anyone about? Anyone? 
137,(The half-timbered houses are silent.) 
138,DOCTOR: No one about. Let's try the pub.
139,
140,[Fleur de Lys]
141,
142,"(It is open, but empty. There are two nearly full"
143,"pint jugs on the bar. Another jug and a glass of wine on a table, more"
144,on another.) 
145,DOCTOR: Hello? Innkeeper? 
146,SARAH: Hello? Anyone about? 
147,DOCTOR: What's this pub called? 
148,"SARAH: Er, Fleur de Lys, wasn't it? "
149,DOCTOR: What? 
150,SARAH: Fleur de Lys. 
151,"DOCTOR: Marie Celeste, more like it. "
152,SARAH: It's weird. A whole village full of people can't just disappear.
153,
154,(The Doctor opens the till.) 
155,DOCTOR: Here it is again. 
156,SARAH: What? 
157,"DOCTOR: Freshly minted money, all the same year. Sarah? "
158,SARAH: Hmm? 
159,DOCTOR: What was that story you came here on? 
160,SARAH: There was a bit of a brouhaha at the Space Defence Station. It's
161,about a mile from here. 
162,"DOCTOR: Is it. If we've landed in a prohibited area, then those people"
163,who shot at us were possibly guards. 
164,"SARAH: Trespassers are prosecuted in England, not killed. Anyway, they"
165,weren't dressed like guards. 
166,"DOCTOR: Protective clothing? Some kind of radioactivity? Remember, I"
167,detected an energy source. The soldier who went over the cliff was
168,possibly affected by it. 
169,SARAH: Radiation sickness? 
170,DOCTOR: Something like that. 
171,"SARAH: And this place, the village? "
172,DOCTOR: Evacuated. 
173,SARAH: Then it must've been done in a hurry. 
174,"DOCTOR: If some dangerous substance leaked, it would be an emergency. "
175,SARAH: That's great. And we've been walking around in the middle of it
176,like a couple of 'narnas. 
177,DOCTOR: It's only a speculation. 
178,SARAH: It's a nasty one. What about the money? 
179,DOCTOR: Contamination precaution. Money changes hands. In a place like
180,"this, it might be necessary to bring in clean currency every few"
181,months. 
182,(Sarah looks out of the window.) 
183,SARAH: Doctor. 
184,DOCTOR: Huh? 
185,SARAH: The village isn't deserted anymore. 
186,"(The four figures are walking down the road from the church, escorting"
187,a soldier.) 
188,"SARAH: No, it can't be. It can't be! "
189,DOCTOR: That's impossible. 
190,"(As they pass the pub, it is clearly the Lance Corporal, no longer"
191,twitching or dead.) 
192,SARAH: He was dead. We saw him. 
193,(Sarah steps back and knocks into a table. The empty glasses fall over
194,"and one smashes on the floor. Outside, the group stops, then approaches"
195,the front door.) 
196,SARAH: They heard me. 
197,DOCTOR: Wait. 
198,(A pick-up van drives up with a group of villagers sitting in the back.
199,"Young, old, the vicar in his panama hat. They stand when the engine is"
200,turned off. A white-suited figure gets out of the cab and unfastens the
201,"side. The people step down and go on their way, blank and staring.) "
202,"SARAH: (sotto) The man in the tweed jacket, that's Mister Morgan, the"
203,landlord. 
204,DOCTOR: (sotto) Come on. 
205,(They go through an internal door and shut it behind them. Morgan leads
206,the soldier and several people into the pub. The Doctor and Sarah open
207,the door slightly and watch as they resume their places and their
208,"drinks, still as statues. Then the clock chimes and they all come to"
209,life.) 
210, [Back room] 
211, DOCTOR: Extraordinary. 
212,SARAH: What's the matter with them? 
213,"DOCTOR: I haven't the faintest idea, but I intend to find out. "
214,SARAH: How? 
215,DOCTOR: Space Defence Station. I could contact UNIT from there. You
216,stay here and keep an eye on things. 
217,SARAH: Eh? 
218,DOCTOR: You'll be all right. 
219,SARAH: I've heard that before. 
220,DOCTOR: Can you find your way back to the Tardis? 
221,SARAH: Of course I can. 
222,(The Doctor gives her the Tardis key.) 
223,"DOCTOR: Right. If anything goes wrong, meet me there. "
224,SARAH: And what if 
225,(The Doctor has already left.) 
226, [Fleur de Lys] 
227, (The previously dead soldier notices the door knob
228,"turning, and pulls it open suddenly. Sarah nearly falls into the bar."
229,Everyone stares at her.) 
230,"SARAH: Afternoon. Well, just about, anyway. Hallo. Mister Morgan, isn't"
231,"it? You remember me, don't you? Sarah Jane Smith? I came here on a"
232,story. I stayed here about two years ago. 
233,(Silence and blank stares.) 
234,"SARAH: Well, somebody say something. "
235,ADAMS: Who sent you? 
236,"SARAH: What do you mean, who sent me? "
237,ADAMS: How did you get here? 
238,"SARAH: I walked. Look, perhaps you'd like "
239,ADAMS: What are you doing here? 
240,SARAH: Do you allow all your customers to be grilled like this? 
241,ADAMS: We don't have strangers here. 
242,"SARAH: Oh, come on, that's ridiculous. "
243,MORGAN: Wait. She may be part of the test. 
244,SARAH: Test? What test? 
245,ADAMS: She doesn't know. 
246,"SARAH: What don't I know? Look, what's going on here? "
247,"MORGAN: I think you'd better go, Miss. "
248,SARAH: Why? 
249,MORGAN: It might be best. 
250,"SARAH: Look, if there's some sort of trouble, perhaps I could help. I"
251,"see. Well, I intend to find out, anyway. "
252,(Sarah backs towards the door. The soldier steps towards her.) 
253,SARAH: And I'm sure you shouldn't be drinking so soon after breaking
254,your neck. 
255,(Sarah leaves very quickly. The pick up is still outside with the
256,figure facing forward. It's visor is open. She hides behind the vehicle
257,"and the figure turns round. Instead of a face, it has circuitry. Sarah"
258,runs back towards the woods and it watches her go.)
259,
260, [Space Defence Station reception]
261,
262,(A modern concrete building - Nuclear Research
263,Establishment I think - with a giant radio telescope added and no
264,perimeter security. The Doctor strolls through the paved courtyard and
265,through the main sliding doors. He finds a blank armed soldier in the
266,reception area.) 
267,DOCTOR: Can you tell me where I can find the CO? The Commanding
268,Officer? 
269,(No reply.) 
270,DOCTOR: I'll tell you what. I won't bother you. 
271,(The Doctor goes down a corridor and looks in the first room he comes
272,through. The soldier does not follow so he carries on out of our sight.
273,Then the soldier slowly turns to look.)
274,
275,[Woodland]
276,
277,(Sarah returns to the Tardis and is just putting
278,the key in the lock when she notices the artefact from the quarry
279,sitting nearby. She leaves the key in the lock and goes to investigate.
280,The Tardis starts up.) 
281,SARAH: Doctor! Don't go! I'm still here! 
282,(The Tardis dematerialises.) 
283,SARAH: Don't leave me. 
284,(The artefact begins to open.) 
285,SARAH: Can't have gone. 
286,(A hand from the artefact grabs her leg. Sarah squeals and runs away a
287,"few steps, then turns to a shiny-looking man is lying inside it. She"
288,goes back and kneels next to him.) 
289,SARAH: Can I help you? 
290,"(The man grabs her around the throat, but she gets free and runs back"
291,into the woods.)
292,
293, [Crayford's office]
294,
295,(A man with a patch over his left eye is startled
296,by the intercom. He runs into his office to answer the
297,permanently annoyed voice.) 
298,"STYGGRON : Crayford! Crayford! Crayford, I say. "
299,"CRAYFORD: Yes, Styggron. "
300,STYGGRON : I ordered all units to recharge stations. The order is
301,not being observed. 
302,"CRAYFORD: In what way, Styggron? "
303,STYGGRON : We have detected movement within the complex. A unit may
304,have gone random. Check and report! 
305,"CRAYFORD: Yes, Styggron. Immediately, Styggron. "
306,"(Crayford goes out of his office, pauses and goes into the next room."
307,The Doctor comes through a fire door and along the hall. He stops at
308,the room Crayford has gone into then notices the name plate on
309,Crayford's office. Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart. He knocks and enters) 
310, [Crayford's office] 
311, DOCTOR: Alistair? Alistair? 
312,"(The Doctor reads a note on the desk, then picks up an Ordnance Survey"
313,map and starts to unfold it. Crayford enters through an interconnecting
314,door with a gun in his hand.) 
315,CRAYFORD: Keep your hands where I can see them. 
316,DOCTOR: Those are the first friendly words I've heard since I got here.
317,
318,"CRAYFORD: Yes, I dare say. And just how did you get here, incidentally?"
319,
320,"DOCTOR: Oh, I dropped in. You know, I do from time to time. "
321,CRAYFORD: I can easily get the truth from you. 
322,DOCTOR: You're getting it. 
323,(Crayford snatches the map.) 
324,DOCTOR: Who are you? 
325,CRAYFORD: I'm asking the questions and I have the gun. 
326,DOCTOR: I just wondered. You're in someone else's office. It says
327,Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart on the door. 
328,CRAYFORD: You know the Brigadier? 
329,DOCTOR: Mmm. I'm his unpaid scientific advisor. 
330,"CRAYFORD: Oh yes. Yes, I see. I see, you're the Doctor. "
331,DOCTOR: Yes. 
332,"CRAYFORD: Yes, I've heard of you. "
333,DOCTOR: Good. Who are you? 
334,"CRAYFORD: I'm the Senior Defence astronaut, Guy Crayford. "
335,"DOCTOR: Well, how do you do. "
336,"CRAYFORD: Get your hands up, Doctor, thank you. You could be an"
337,"impostor, couldn't you. "
338,"DOCTOR: Look, I've got a suggestion. My arms are beginning to ache. Why"
339,not call Lethbridge Stewart and get him to identify me? 
340,CRAYFORD: Lethbridge Stewart is in Geneva. Colonel Faraday is in
341,command. 
342,(Crayford presses a button the intercom.) 
343,"DOCTOR: If you're calling the butler, I'm very partial to tea and"
344,muffins. 
345,CRAYFORD: You're going to have to stay in detention until your
346,identity's been verified. 
347,"DOCTOR: Oh, please, no detention. Not detention. You see, I suffer from"
348,
349,(The Doctor overturns the desk. Crayford shoots and misses as the
350,Doctor dashes into the hallway.)
351,
352,[Outside Crayford's office]
353,
354,(The soldier appears at the end of the hallway. The
355,Doctor runs through the fire door and climbs a ladder to a loft hatch.)
356,
357,"CRAYFORD: Get after him, man! "
358,(The solder arrives just in time to see the loft hatch close.) 
359, [SDC roof] 
360," (With alarms whooping, and soldiers firing rifles"
361,"from lower levels, the Doctor runs along the parapet and jumps down"
362,"onto a gravel area, where one then two white-suited figures are"
363,pointing their fingers at him. Sarah sees all this.) 
364,DOCTOR: Is that finger loaded? 
365,"(The Doctor is taken away. After a moment, Sarah comes out of hiding"
366,and follows.)
367,
368, [Outside SDC cell]
369,
370,(The Doctor is taken down a hallway with a
371,"telephone on the wall at the entrance end, and put into a room with a"
372,grille on the door. A figure bolts it from the outside then the pair
373,leave. Sarah sneaks up.) 
374,"SARAH: (sotto) Doctor? Doctor, can you hear me? "
375,"DOCTOR : Sarah, what are you doing here? "
376,"SARAH: Rescuing you, actually. For a change. "
377,DOCTOR : Thank you. 
378,(Sarah starts to unbolt the door. An intercom on the wall by the door
379,swings back to reveal that a small eye in a large brown face is
380,watching her.) 
381, Part Two
382,
383, [Outside SDC cell] 
384," (Nervous, Sarah looks up and the panel closes"
385,again.) 
386,DOCTOR : Get a move on. 
387,SARAH: It's stuck! 
388,(She frees the bottom bolt and the other two undo easily. The Doctor
389,comes out.) 
390,"SARAH: Doctor, what did you do? "
391,DOCTOR: Ask me later. Come on.
392,
393, [Kraal ship]
394,
395,(The theme here is brown and round. We only get
396,"glimpses of the constantly angry alien - a boot, a hand, a piece of"
397,tunic.) 
398,STYGGRON: Crayford? 
399,"CRAYFORD : Yes, Styggron? "
400,"STYGGRON: Crayford, a second random unit in the cell area. What has"
401,gone wrong? 
402,CRAYFORD : A second? 
403,STYGGRON: These patterns were not programmed. Explain. 
404,"CRAYFORD : Styggron, was this second unit a female? "
405,"STYGGRON: Yes, one of the village section. Check the directives. A"
406,fault must have developed. 
407,"CRAYFORD [on monitor: It's not a fault, Styggron, it's a remarkable"
408,success. 
409,STYGGRON: A success? 
410,"CRAYFORD : They are space travellers. The Doctor, as he is"
411,"called, is a humanoid, a scientist who advices on Earth Defence. His"
412,companion is human. 
413,STYGGRON: I see. Then they are externals. 
414,CRAYFORD : They've arrived by error. 
415,"STYGGRON: Perhaps by error, perhaps by design. "
416,CRAYFORD : Design? 
417,STYGGRON: If this Doctor advises on defence 
418,(An alarm sounds.) 
419,CRAYFORD : The cell block. 
420,"STYGGRON: They must not escape, Crayford. They must not escape!"
421,
422, [Outside SDC closet]
423,
424,"(A group of soldiers run along a hallway, past a"
425,small red access door.) 
426,"SARAH : Doctor, what on Earth did you do? "
427,DOCTOR : Do? 
428,"SARAH : For them to lock you up? I mean, they seem to be taking you"
429,very seriously.
430,
431,[SDC closet]
432,
433, DOCTOR: I didn't do anything. Just finding me on
434,the premises was enough to upset Crayford. 
435,SARAH: Crayford? 
436,"DOCTOR: Yes, Guy Crayford. He said he was the senior astronaut. "
437,SARAH: But that's impossible. Guy Crayford was killed. 
438,DOCTOR: How? 
439,SARAH: That was the first test of the XK-5 space freighter. Crayford
440,"was out in space, deep space, and then they lost him. The ship just"
441,vanished. They thought he'd hit an asteroid. 
442,(More footsteps running past.) 
443,"SARAH: Guy Crayford is dead, Doctor."
444,
445, [Crayford's office]
446,
447," CRAYFORD: There's no cause for alarm, Styggron."
448,The station is being thoroughly searched section by section. All exits
449,are covered and the guards have orders to shoot on sight. 
450,STYGGRON : Then countermand that order. They must be kept alive for
451,pattern analysis. 
452,"CRAYFORD: But Styggron, we already have a complete pattern for the"
453,village and Defence complex. 
454,STYGGRON : Do as I say. The Doctor may have learned of the Kraal
455,plan. He may be here to spy. It is essential for us to know. 
456,"CRAYFORD: No, Styggron, no. They must be eliminated! They must be"
457,destroyed!
458,
459, [Space Defence Centre reception]
460,
461,(The Doctor comes through a fire door and
462,recognises the figure with his back to them.) 
463,"DOCTOR: Well, well, well. It's a small world. "
464,"SARAH: Isn't it. Hello, Mister Benton! "
465,(Benton turns and points his pistol at the Doctor.) 
466,DOCTOR: Benton? 
467,"SARAH: Benton, it's us! "
468,
469,[Crayford's office]
470,
471, STYGGRON : You shall do as I say! 
472,(Crayford grabs his head in pain.) 
473,CRAYFORD: Ow! Ow! No! Stop! All right! 
474,(He uses the intercom.) 
475,CRAYFORD: All units. The order to kill is cancelled.
476,
477, [Space Defence Centre reception]
478,
479," (Benton suddenly sags then bends forward, hand to"
480,forehead.) 
481,DOCTOR: Come on. 
482,(The Doctor and Sarah leave the building. Benton recovers then runs
483,along the hall to an intercom outside Crayford's office.) 
484,"BENTON: This is B block, main entrance. They've just escaped, sir. "
485,(A soldier arrives.) 
486,"BENTON: Ah, Corporal Alert the security patrol immediately. The rest of"
487,"you, get after them! Spread out. "
488,"(The soldiers run out of the door, and we look at the reception desk"
489,while they whoosh shut again.) 
490,SARAH : Why did we come back? We should've hoofed it when we had
491,the chance. We're bound to be caught now. 
492,DOCTOR : On the contrary. 
493,(The Doctor stands up from behind the desk.) 
494,"DOCTOR: The further they spread out, the better our chance of escape. "
495,CRAYFORD : Sullivan! 
496,"(He ducks back down as Crayford enters, followed by a certain Naval"
497,Lieutenant.) 
498,CRAYFORD: Take a mobile troop and put a cordon on the perimeter road. 
499,"HARRY: Yes, sir. "
500,(Harry leaves the building.) 
501,SARAH: (sotto) Harry's not a soldier. 
502,DOCTOR: That improves our chances. 
503,SARAH: All our friends 
504,DOCTOR: Lead by a dead man. Fascinating. 
505,"SARAH: Look, what's going on? "
506,DOCTOR: How do you know Crayford's dead? 
507,SARAH: It was that story I came here on two years ago. Why? 
508,DOCTOR: I don't think Crayford died in space. When he finally got back
509,"here, something returned with him. "
510,SARAH: What? 
511,DOCTOR: Something that's controlling every human being for miles
512,around. 
513,SARAH: Including Harry and Mister Benton. 
514,DOCTOR: Yes. Come on. 
515,SARAH: Where are we going? 
516,DOCTOR: Back to the village. We've got to warn London.
517,
518, [Woodland outside SDC]
519,
520, DOCTOR: So far so good. 
521,SARAH: As the man said when he fell from the skyscraper. 
522,"(Woof, woof, woof.) "
523,SARAH: Dogs! 
524,DOCTOR: Tracker dogs? 
525,(They run deeper into the woodland.)
526,
527,[Woodland]
528,
529,(Sarah falls.) 
530,SARAH: Ah! 
531,DOCTOR: Are you all right? 
532,SARAH: Yes! 
533,"DOCTOR: Well, come on then. "
534,"(Sarah follows, limping slightly, but she can't really keep up with"
535,"him. Meanwhile, the"
536,Rottweiler's pick up their scent.) 
537,DOCTOR: Come on. 
538,SARAH: Can't. Hurt my ankle. 
539,DOCTOR: I'll carry you. 
540,"SARAH: No, you won't. I'll only slow you down. "
541,DOCTOR: Give me your scarf. 
542,SARAH: Hmm? 
543,"DOCTOR: Quickly, quickly, come on! I'll try to draw them off. You can"
544,hide in the tree. 
545,(Sarah gives him the white scarf from her pink sailor suit.) 
546,SARAH: But how 
547,(The Doctor puts her over his shoulder and takes her to the nearest
548,"tree, then boost her up to reach a low branch.) "
549,"DOCTOR: Come on, up. "
550,"(With Sarah safely up the tree, the Doctor removes his jacket and drags"
551,it and her scarf on the ground.) 
552,"DOCTOR: See you back at the pub. If I'm not there in an hour, try the"
553,Tardis. 
554,(He runs off.) 
555,"SARAH: Doctor, I forgot to tell you "
556,(The Doctor is out of sight.) 
557,SARAH: The Tardis is gone. 
558,"(The dogs lead the soldiers straight past her tree. A little way ahead,"
559,"by a river, the Doctor ditches his hat, jacket and scarf, and runs on."
560,The dogs come to a halt.) 
561,ADAMS: They must have swum across. 
562,(A dog is sniffing a shoe.) 
563,"ADAMS: Right, you two go that way. We'll try to head them off. "
564,"(The hunting party divides, and the Doctor comes up for air. Sarah"
565,comes down from her tree and tries to run. Adams spots her.)
566,
567, [Kraal ship]
568,
569, STYGGRON: Report! Report! 
570,CRAYFORD : The girl is captured. We shall soon have the
571,Doctor. 
572,"STYGGRON: No! Locate him, but do not seize him. I have other plans for"
573,the Doctor. 
574, [Styggron's lab] 
575, (Two soldiers carry a covered stretcher in and put
576,it on the floor. They remove the cover to reveal Sarah. 
577,"Meanwhile, Devesham is once more deserted as the Doctor crosses the"
578,road to the public telephone box. Unfortunately he cannot get a dialing
579,tone. 
580,The soldiers leave Sarah strapped onto a curved bench with holes around
581,"the side. She wakes, and struggles against her restraints.) "
582,"HARRY: It's no good, Miss Smith. "
583,SARAH: Harry? 
584,"(Harry operates a squidgy alien control on a console, and Sarah is"
585,bathed in pulsing blue light.) 
586,HARRY: She's ready. 
587,STYGGRON : Commence the analysis of the brain. 
588,"(The light changes to blue then yellow, and Sarah gasps in pain. She"
589,sees the distorted face of Styggron.)
590,
591, [Fleur de Lys]
592,
593,(The Doctor enters and tries the telephone on the
594,bar. No dialling tone. He goes to the internal door and opens it.) 
595,"MORGAN: Something you want, sir? "
596,DOCTOR: Yes. A telephone that works. Yours is out of order. 
597,(Morgan enters the bar.) 
598,MORGAN: Likely it is. 
599,DOCTOR: So is the village call box. 
600,"MORGAN: There was a gale last night, sir. Brought all the lines down. "
601,DOCTOR: Ah. I always told Alexander Bell that wires were unreliable. 
602,"MORGAN: Can I get you a drink, sir? "
603,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'll have a pint. "
604,MORGAN: A pint of what? 
605,DOCTOR: Ginger beer. 
606,(Morgan removes the cap from a bottle and pours it into a pint mug. The
607,Doctor picks the darts from a table near the board.) 
608,MORGAN: You must be one of them scientists from the Defence Station. 
609,"DOCTOR: Well, yes and no, or no and yes, so to speak. As it were. Do"
610,you get much custom from there? 
611,MORGAN: Don't come down here much. 
612,DOCTOR: Really? 
613,MORGAN: Nothing for them in Devesham. Nothing for strangers here. 
614,"DOCTOR: Yes. Too quiet, I suppose. "
615,"MORGAN: Except for darts club night, of course. "
616,DOCTOR: Ha. Of course. 
617,(The Doctor throws the three darts at the board in a slightly
618,"unorthodox style. Three bulls-eyes, of course. He goes to remove them.)"
619,"DOCTOR: Hey, this is a brand new darts board. Never been used before."
620,
621,[Kraal ship]
622,
623,(The monitor shows the view through the darts
624,"board, with the Doctor running his hand over it.) "
625,"STYGGRON: See? He is puzzled. Suspicious, but not certain. "
626,(He turns the monitor off. A second Kraal enters.) 
627,"CHEDAKI: There is no value in this experiment, Styggron. Our strategy"
628,is settled. 
629,"STYGGRON: Strategy is formulated upon knowledge, Chedaki. "
630,CHEDAKI: The time for experiment is past. 
631,"STYGGRON: In the case of the Earth, yes, but there are other worlds"
632,that our people can conquer. It is important to see that our techniques
633,"are flawless, and the Doctor is unprogrammed. A free agent. "
634,(Styggron turns on the intercom.) 
635,STYGGRON: Crayford! 
636, [Crayford's office] 
637," CRAYFORD: Yes, Styggron? "
638,STYGGRON : Commence the final test. 
639,CRAYFORD: Direct communication. 
640, [Kraal ship] 
641, STYGGRON: Yes. Are the preparations complete? 
642, [Crayford's office] 
643, CRAYFORD: There should have been sufficient time.
644,"I will check, Styggron."
645,
646,[Kraal ship]
647,
648, CHEDAKI: The data that was drained from the girl
649,shows the Doctor's long association with libertarian causes. His entire
650,"history is one of opposition to conquest. While he lives, he is a"
651,threat. 
652,"STYGGRON: His history will end soon, Chedaki, when I have nothing"
653,further to learn from studying him.
654,
655, [Styggron's lab]
656,
657,(The examination table is empty when Crayford
658,enters.) 
659,CRAYFORD: Where's the girl? 
660,HARRY: The analysis is completed. We have her memory print and body
661,parameters. They're being coded. 
662,"CRAYFORD: Right. Well, see she's properly guarded. Styggron wants to"
663,run a test on the Doctor. Is the programming complete? 
664,"HARRY: Yes, sir. We can begin at once. "
665,"CRAYFORD: Right. Good, good."
666,
667,[Fleur de Lys]
668,
669,(The Doctor is investigating a cigar in an ashtray
670,with his magnifying glass. Then he moves to the brasses hanging on the
671,wall by the fireplace.) 
672,DOCTOR: Yuk. Plastic horse brass? 
673,(Morgan is standing right behind him.) 
674,DOCTOR: I've arranged to wait for someone here. Don't let me detain
675,you. 
676,MORGAN: That's all right. 
677,"DOCTOR: Well, I can see you're a busy man. Barrels to tap, empties to"
678,"count, that sort of thing. "
679,MORGAN: No hurry for that. 
680,"DOCTOR: Right, then I'll have another pint. "
681,MORGAN: A pint of what? 
682,"DOCTOR: Well, ginger pop, please. "
683,(Morgan goes back to the bar. The Doctor puts some coins on the counter
684,and looks at the calendar. He tears off the current date - Friday July
685,"6th - to reveal another Friday July 6th underneath, and another, and"
686,another.) 
687,DOCTOR: Strange. A village without a future? (The telephone rings. The
688,Doctor hands the receiver to Morgan.) 
689,MORGAN: Fleur de Lys? It's for you. 
690,"DOCTOR: Is it? Hello? Sarah? What's happened, where are you?"
691,
692, [Village shop]
693,
694," SARAH: They caught me, but I managed to escape."
695,"Listen, Doctor, I've found out their whole plan. No. No, the inn is one"
696,of their centres. That's why I didn't come there.
697,
698,[Fleur de Lys]
699,
700," DOCTOR: where are you, Sarah?"
701,
702,[Village shop]
703,
704, SARAH: The village store. You can cut through to
705,"it behind the pub. Yes, I'll wait for you. But Doctor, be careful."
706,Those robot mechanics are planted everywhere.
707,
708,[Fleur de Lys]
709,
710," DOCTOR: Don't worry, Sarah. Who'd notice me? "
711,"(The Doctor puts the phone down, then picks it up again.) "
712,"DOCTOR: Well, would you believe it? It's out of order again. Thanks for"
713,the hospitality. (The Doctor leaves through the back door. Morgan does
714,not move.)
715,
716, [Kraal ship]
717,
718, CHEDAKI: If the androids were to fail in their
719,"task, the Kraal invasion of Earth could not even begin. Suppose the"
720,Doctor were to turn the androids against us? It would jeopardise the
721,whole operation! 
722,STYGGRON: Impossible! 
723,"CHEDAKI: Is it? He is a scientist too, Styggron. "
724,"STYGGRON: Well, the androids are centrally governed. Their programming"
725,is controlled from here. 
726,CHEDAKI: They could be reprogrammed> He has the knowledge. 
727,STYGGRON: An interesting possibility. 
728,"CHEDAKI: The androids are a double-edged weapon, Styggron. They are"
729,"unstoppable, indestructible. "
730,(Chedaki leaves and Crayford enters.) 
731,"CRAYFORD: Everything is ready, Styggron. "
732,"STYGGRON: Not quite. I need one more android, Crayford. I must call on"
733,your experience for its production. 
734,CRAYFORD: But you already have my data. The memory prints in the
735,disorientation centre. 
736,STYGGRON: This is new. You must be reprocessed. 
737,"CRAYFORD: Styggron, I can't go through that again. "
738,STYGGRON: I need one special unit. An android programmed to attack
739,Kraals. 
740,CRAYFORD: But I don't 
741,"STYGGRON: Do not argue, Crayford! Come!"
742,
743,[Village shop]
744,
745,(The Doctor runs along a lane between quaint
746,"cottages, then crosses over to AV & NG Kirby's shop, and"
747,enters. A bell rings as the door opens and closes.) 
748,"SARAH: Is that you, Doctor? "
749,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course it is. How did you get away? "
750,(Sarah stands up from behind the counter. Somehow she has got her scarf
751,back.) 
752,"SARAH: Oh, thank goodness. I've been terrified! "
753,DOCTOR: I left you up a tree. 
754,SARAH: I climbed out of the tree and those soldiers were waiting for
755,"me. I was knocked out. When I came round, I was in some kind of"
756,"operating theatre. Doctor, I was so frightened. "
757,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sure you were. Have some ginger pop. Here. "
758,"(He takes a bottle from his coat pocket, unscrews the top and hands it"
759,to her. She drinks.) 
760,"SARAH: It was delicious. Harry was there. Well, not the real Harry, of"
761,"course, but I thought it was. "
762,"DOCTOR: What do you mean, not the real Harry? "
763,"SARAH: Well, Doctor, that's what they're doing. They're copying people."
764,
765,DOCTOR: Who are? 
766,"SARAH: I don't know, but Crayford's behind it all. "
767,DOCTOR: Shush. 
768,(The Doctor looks through the glass in the front door to see two
769,white-suited figures emerge from an alley and stand next to number 36.)
770,
771,"DOCTOR: It can't be Crayford, but go on. "
772,SARAH: There's not much more to tell. They put me in some kind of
773,"machine, and I passed out again. "
774,DOCTOR: How did you get away? 
775,"SARAH: When I came round the second time, I heard Crayford talking to"
776,someone. That's when I discovered what they're planning. They're
777,"replacing people with these duplicates they make. Well, they thought I"
778,was still unconscious and left me without a guard. 
779,DOCTOR: And you were lucky enough to find this place? And the only
780,telephone in the place that worked. 
781,SARAH: I don't understand. 
782,DOCTOR: I think they let you make that telephone call. 
783,SARAH: What do you mean? 
784,DOCTOR: I mean we're being tested. They want to find out how smart we
785,are. 
786,(The white figures walk away.) 
787,"SARAH: No, it can't be that. "
788,"DOCTOR: Of course it's that. What I don't understand is, if they're so"
789,"advanced in technology, they've made facsimile human beings good enough"
790,"to stand face to face examination, and sent them through a space time"
791,"warp to Earth, what can they be afraid of? They must possess the"
792,weaponry to take the Earth by force. They've created a bridgehead by
793,stealth using androids. Fake humans. Come on. 
794,SARAH: Where are we going? 
795,"DOCTOR: Well, there's a radio in the Tardis. Are you coming? "
796,SARAH: Coming. 
797,DOCTOR: Let's go.
798,
799, [Styggron's lab] 
800, (Crayford is on the table.) 
801,"STYGGRON: This should answer your fears, Chedaki. From Crayford's"
802,memory cells we will now create a totally hostile android. 
803,"CRAYFORD: Don't, Styggron, I beg you. "
804,"(Styggron turns on the machine. The blue light pulses, and is joined by"
805,yellow. Crayford groans in pain then passes out.) 
806,"CHEDAKI : What is the purpose of this, Styggron? "
807,STYGGRON: Watch. 
808,(A skeletal android turns into a soldier.) 
809,STYGGRON: I will now activate the hostility circuits. 
810,(The soldier brings his rifle up to the ready and half crouches. He
811,"swings round to shoot Styggron, who instead shoots him with red energy"
812,bolts from a small hand-held device. The soldier is thrown back across
813,the area and writhes briefly on the floor before becoming still.) 
814,"STYGGRON: See? They are not indestructible, Chedaki. What I can create,"
815,I can also destroy! 
816,(The android returns to its skeletal state.) 
817,CHEDAKI : That weapon. It is new. 
818,"STYGGRON: So far effective only at short range, but my armoury section"
819,is developing a much more powerful version for our space cruisers.
820,"Science, Chedaki! Science will make the Kraals invincible!"
821,
822, [Woodland] 
823, (The Doctor and Sarah avoid a pair of white
824,mechanicals then continue to the small clearing.) 
825,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, this is the oak tree. This is where we landed. "
826,"SARAH: Well, it's not here now, is it. "
827,DOCTOR: It's not programmed to auto-operate. There's a fail safe.
828,Unless 
829,"SARAH: Unless what, Doctor? "
830,"DOCTOR: Of course, I know. You've still got a Tardis key, haven't you? "
831,SARAH: I must've lost it. 
832,"DOCTOR: You haven't lost it. You never had it. Sarah came here, turned"
833,"the key in the lock, and cancelled the pause control. The Tardis"
834,continued on its set coordinates back to Earth. 
835,SARAH: I don't understand. 
836,"DOCTOR: Yes, you do. This isn't Earth. This isn't real wood. It's some"
837,kind of artificial material like plastic. These are not real trees. And
838,you're not the real Sarah. 
839,(Sarah steps back and produces a pistol.) 
840,"SARAH: Get back, Doctor. "
841,"DOCTOR: I knew at once. You see, the real Sarah wasn't wearing her"
842,scarf. 
843,"(The Doctor takes the scarf from his pocket, then takes off his hat and"
844,knocks Sarah's arm down. She shoots the ground and drops the weapon. He
845,grabs her.) 
846,DOCTOR: What have you done with Sarah? Where is the real Sarah? 
847,(The facsimile pulls away from him then falls to the ground. The face
848,mask falls off to reveal the circuitry inside.) 
849, Part Three
850,
851,[Woodland]
852,
853,(The Doctor turns and runs. The android Sarah sits
854,"up and shoots at him several times, but misses.)"
855,
856,[Kraal ship]
857,
858,(The android's eye view of the woodland is on the
859,monitor.) 
860,"CHEDAKI: A foolish experiment, Styggron. The Doctor is at large. "
861,STYGGRON: There's no way of escape. 
862,(Styggron switches off the monitor. We see the real Sarah lying face
863,down on a bench.) 
864,STYGGRON: He can do no harm. 
865,CHEDAKI: He is a Time Lord. 
866,STYGGRON: At the end of his time. The androids are now fully trained.
867,Both the village and the Doctor will be destroyed in precisely nine
868,minutes. 
869,CHEDAKI: Nine minutes? 
870,STYGGRON: The invasion countdown has begun. There will be no variation
871,in the schedule. 
872,CHEDAKI: I understand. Is there a safe method of destroying the
873,training ground? 
874,"STYGGRON: A matter dissolving bomb, which I shall place in position. "
875,"(Another Kraal enters, carrying a device the size of a coffee table"
876,style book.) 
877,CHEDAKI: Good. The Earth female. She is still alive? 
878,"STYGGRON: Yes, Marshal Chedaki. She has been preserved. "
879,CHEDAKI: Why? 
880,STYGGRON: Another of my foolish experiments. The virus which our
881,androids will use to cleanse the Earth of its human population has only
882,been proved in laboratory conditions. I wish to test it on a living
883,human organism. 
884,"(Styggron takes the bomb and leaves. Chedaki follows, then the Kraal.) "
885,"CHEDAKI: Ah. Good, good. That's a good idea, Styggron. "
886,"STYGGRON : Praise indeed, from a soldier. "
887,(Sarah opens her eyes and starts to get up.) 
888,SARAH: Nine minutes. 
889,(She leaves. 
890,"Meanwhile, in the village, the vicar stands on a grass verge opposite"
891,"two white suits. The van drives up, and the Doctor watches from the"
892,other side of a hedge as the side is dropped and the villagers climb
893,into the back. The van drives away and the Doctor walks into the middle
894,of the deserted road.) 
895, [Kraal ship hatchway] 
896, CRAYFORD: Come on now. Hurry along. 
897,"(With the village visible through the hatch, soldiers, white suits and"
898,"a villager run into the ship, past Harry.) "
899,CRAYFORD: Quickly now. 
900,"(Sarah is hiding, kneeling behind Crayford. More villagers and soldiers"
901,enter. The last in is RSM Benton.) 
902,CRAYFORD: Any more? 
903,"BENTON: We're the last, sir. "
904,CRAYFORD: Right. 
905,(Benton closes the hatchway and follows the others deeper into the
906,ship.) 
907,CRAYFORD: See all the blast doors are closed. You have four minutes. 
908,"HARRY: Yes, sir. (Harry and Crayford leave in opposite directions."
909,Sarah reopens the hatchway and leaves.)

912,
913,(The Doctor is still pondering when he is grabbed
914,from behind.) 
915,"DOCTOR: Oh, hello. "
916,STYGGRON: Resistance is inadvisable. 
917,"DOCTOR: Look here, we haven't been introduced, have we? "
918,STYGGRON: This is no time for niceties. 
919,"(Styggron pushes the Doctor to the ground, and a white suit picks him"
920,"up, holding his arms tightly. A second white suit gets some plastic ivy"
921,from a hedge and they use it to tie his hands behind him around the
922,village cross. Styggron places his bomb on the stone steps and
923,activates it.) 
924,"DOCTOR: Well, well, well. An MD bomb. "
925,"STYGGRON: In exactly three minutes, our simulated Earth village will"
926,"evaporate, and you with it! "
927,"DOCTOR: You're really enjoying this, aren't you? "
928,(Styggron turns to follow the white suits out of the village. He walks
929,like an
930,orangutan.) 
931,DOCTOR: Don't go. Stay. Just for a few minutes. Then we can all go
932,together. 
933,(The bomb's whining goes up a pitch.) 
934,SARAH : Doctor? Doctor? 
935,DOCTOR: I'm over here! 
936,(Sarah runs towards him.) 
937,"SARAH: Listen, this place is going to be blown sky high. Well, don't"
938,"just sit there, come on! "
939,"DOCTOR: I'm not just sitting here, I'm tied up. "
940,SARAH: What? 
941,DOCTOR: Knife in my right hand pocket. 
942,SARAH: It won't cut. It's as strong as steel. 
943,DOCTOR: Of course. It's their artificial ivy. Try the sonic
944,screwdriver. Set it to theta omega. 
945,BOMB: Thirty seconds. Twenty five seconds. 
946,"(The plastic starts to melt, then breaks.) "
947,BOMB: Twenty seconds. 
948,(The Doctor runs up the road.) 
949,SARAH: Hang on! I know one of the ways out! 
950,"BOMB: Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight,"
951,"seven, six, five, four, three, two. "
952,(The Doctor and Sarah run through the door of an ivy covered cottage.) 
953, [Kraal ship hatchway] 
954," BOMB: One, zero! "
955,"(Sarah closes the hatch, but they still get the effect of the shockwave"
956,"before it shuts completely. Outside, the picturesque village fades away"
957,"to leave a bleak, barren waste.) "
958,DOCTOR: A bit close. 
959,SARAH: Wouldn't have cared to have been any closer. 
960,CRAYFORD: Escort them to the cell. I must report this to Styggron. 
961,DOCTOR: Styggron? Who's Styggron? 
962,CRAYFORD: Move! 
963,(Harry and some soldiers take the Doctor and Sarah away.) 
964,DOCTOR: I prefer our Harry.

966, [Kraal ship]
967,
968, KRAAL : Leader rocket in launch phase. Time to
969,"lift off, ninety minutes. "
970,STYGGRON: Have the pre-launch checks been completed? 
971,"KRAAL: Yes, the androids are being loaded now. "
972,CRAYFORD: Styggron! We have recaptured the girl. She was with the
973,Doctor. 
974,STYGGRON: The Doctor? 
975,CRAYFORD: It seems she helped him to escape. 
976,STYGGRON: He must be destroyed at once. Have him killed. 
977,"CRAYFORD: Why, Styggron? There's really no need. "
978,"STYGGRON: Oh, you're singing a different song now, Crayford. They must"
979,"be eliminated, isn't that what you said? "
980,"CRAYFORD: That was because they were a danger to the plan, Styggron. I"
981,"mean, what harm can they do now, locked away in a cell? "
982,STYGGRON: The Doctor is no longer of any use. 
983,CRAYFORD: But he would make a valuable subject for analysis. 
984,STYGGRON: Analysis? 
985,"CRAYFORD: Yes, the knowledge and experience of a Time Lord would make"
986,"a, well, a useful addition to the Kraal data banks. "
987,"STYGGRON: You were happy for him to die, provided I killed him. You are"
988,"squeamish, Crayford. A puny minded weakling, like all your race. Oh,"
989,"very well, very well. "
990,"CRAYFORD: Thank you, Styggron. "
991,(Crayford leaves.) 
992,"STYGGRON: We shall analyse his brain, and then he shall die. "
993,[Kraal brig]
994,
995, (Sarah puts her scarf back on.) 
996,SARAH: Not on Earth? What do you mean? Of course we're on Earth. 
997,(The Doctor by the door with his sonic screwdriver.) 
998,DOCTOR: Harry and Benton and the rest are not the real thing. 
999,SARAH: Not real? 
1000,"DOCTOR: Fakes, copies. Electronic androids with well programmed"
1001,computers instead of brains. 
1002,SARAH: It all makes sense now. 
1003,"DOCTOR: If I'd had my wits around me, I'd have known it from the start."
1004,Remember that high level of radiation I'd noticed when we left the
1005,Tardis? 
1006,"SARAH: Yes, you thought there'd been a leak from the Defence Station. "
1007,DOCTOR: That was natural radiation. The Kraal planet Oseidon is the
1008,only planet in the galaxy with a level that high. 
1009,(He tries the screwdriver on the door.) 
1010,DOCTOR: This is no good. 
1011,SARAH: Won't that radiation make us ill? 
1012,"DOCTOR: Well, It's not that bad, yet. "
1013,"SARAH: All the same, the sooner we get away from here, the better. "
1014,"DOCTOR: Quite right. Any level of radiation is too high, and it's"
1015,getting worse all the time. Won't be long before the place becomes
1016,uninhabitable. That's why the Kraals are planning to leave and take
1017,over Earth. 
1018,"SARAH: So, everything we've seen has been a fake. "
1019,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1020,SARAH: But the village. 
1021,"DOCTOR: Yes, and the woods, and the Defence Station. Every last detail"
1022,"copied down, including the inhabitants. "
1023,SARAH: Like a sort of training ground.
1024,
1025, [Outside the brig]
1026,
1027,(Crayford is listening.) 
1028,"DOCTOR : Exactly. And they've hardly made a slip. One or two,"
1029,"perhaps, like mint-fresh money all the same date. Otherwise, they've"
1030,got everything right.
1031,
1032, [Kraal ship brig] 
1033," CRAYFORD: I've, er, been listening to your"
1034,conversation. 
1035,"DOCTOR: Well, nobody's perfect. "
1036,CRAYFORD: I hear you're impressed by the thoroughness with which this
1037,operation has been planned. 
1038,"DOCTOR: Well, it is impressive, but doomed to fail in the end. "
1039,"CRAYFORD: Oh no, Doctor. No, shortly I shall leave for Earth. The"
1040,Kraals will project me through the space time warp and my ship will
1041,make a normal re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. 
1042,"DOCTOR: A normal re-entry? Crayford, you've been gone two years,"
1043,assumed dead. 
1044,"CRAYFORD: Ah, yes, Doctor, but I have recently re-established radio"
1045,contact with Earth. They know about the stabiliser failure that sent me
1046,"into orbit around Jupiter. They know how I've rationed my provisions,"
1047,"particularly drinking water. My recycling experiments. Already, every"
1048,telescope on Earth is trained on that little patch of sky where my XK-5
1049,will reappear. 
1050,DOCTOR: A gigantic hoax. 
1051,"CRAYFORD: Exactly, Doctor, yes! And all brilliantly planned by"
1052,"Styggron, the chief scientist of the "
1053,DOCTOR: But helped by you. He couldn't have done it without your
1054,knowledge and memory. 
1055,"CRAYFORD: Yes, the Kraals have a superb technology, Doctor. "
1056,SARAH: Why did you do it? What made you betray Earth? 
1057,"CRAYFORD: Well, didn't Earth betray me? I was written off, wasn't I?"
1058,"Left to die in space. It was the Kraals who saved me. I mean, I was"
1059,"dying, wasn't I? I was being torn apart by gyro failure. And they"
1060,"reconstructed me, Miss Smith, in every detail. Except the one eye that"
1061,"for some reason couldn't be found. Oh no, I owe them everything. "
1062,SARAH: And that's what they want. Everything. They want the world. 
1063,"CRAYFORD: Look, the increasing radiation here means that they're a"
1064,"doomed race. They just have to leave, don't they. I mean, why should a"
1065,people with such skills be allowed to die? 
1066,SARAH: The human race has a few skills of its own. 
1067,"CRAYFORD: Yes, I know, I know. But the Kraals have promised me that no"
1068,"humans will be harmed, as long as they obey the ultimatum that's been"
1069,"prepared. You see, the Kraals are going to take over the northern"
1070,hemisphere and live in peace! I have their word for it. 
1071,"DOCTOR: You've been brainwashed, Crayford. "
1072,"CRAYFORD: Before my spaceship lands, the space shells with the androids"
1073,"inside will be launched. Now, if anyone sees them, they'll just be"
1074,"taken for meteorites, you see? And then the androids will take over the"
1075,key positions in the Defence Complex and the way will be clear for
1076,Marshall Chedaki to bring in the main invasion fleet without a shot
1077,being fired! 
1078,"DOCTOR: I see, I see. Tell me, if your Kraal friends are so unviolent,"
1079,why did Styggron try to vaporise me? 
1080,"CRAYFORD: Oh, yes. Yes, well, they thought you were a danger. "
1081,DOCTOR: Oh. 
1082,"CRAYFORD: You see, Miss Smith's memory prints had showed your past"
1083,intense involvement in the defence of Earth. But I have persuaded them
1084,"to utilise that knowledge. It won't be wasted. See, Styggron's machine"
1085,extracts and feeds into a computer the memory and entire intelligence
1086,"of any living being. It's painful, I know, but it's better than dying. "
1087,STYGGRON : Service mechanics move to leader rocket loading bay now.
1088,
1089,"CRAYFORD: I'm sorry, I have to go now. Now, trust me. I know what I'm"
1090,doing. 
1091,(Crayford leaves.) 
1092,DOCTOR: We have to warn Earth. 
1093,SARAH: How? We don't even have the Tardis.

1097,"(Fake Harry opens a container holding another,"
1098,smaller one.) 
1099,STYGGRON: Only one drop. 
1100,(Chedaki enters.) 
1101,"CHEDAKI: Launch countdown commences in sixty minutes, Styggron. "
1102,STYGGRON: Careful how you handle it. 
1103,CHEDAKI: You are testing the culture. 
1104,"STYGGRON: Yes, Marshall. That small phial contains a death sentence for"
1105,the entire human race. Be careful! 
1106,CHEDAKI: Is it safe? 
1107,STYGGRON: As long as only the androids have contact with the virus. 
1108,"(Harry pours a drop of the culture into a water jug, puts the jug down"
1109,then steps towards Styggron.) 
1110,"STYGGRON: No, no, no, no, no! Place it in the steriliser. "
1111,(Harry puts the phial back in the container then hands the whole thing
1112,over to Styggron.) 
1113,STYGGRON: Good. Now take the tray to the detention cell. 
1114,(Harry picks up a tray containing some bread and the poisoned water jug
1115,and leaves.)

1117, [Kraal ship brig]
1118,
1119,(The Doctor is unscrewing a floor plate with the
1120,sonic screwdriver.) 
1121,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think this has possibilities. "
1122,SARAH: What are you going to do? 
1123,"DOCTOR: Well, if we can somehow lure that guard in, give him a good"
1124,stiff jolt. 
1125,SARAH: Electrocute him? 
1126,"DOCTOR: Well, randomise him, to be accurate. Remember, he's only a"
1127,machine. 
1128,(The door starts to open.) 
1129,SARAH: Someone's coming. 
1130,(They slide the plate over the exposed circuits and Sarah sits on it.
1131,Harry enters with the tray.) 
1132,HARRY: Food and drink. 
1133,(The Doctor takes the tray.) 
1134,DOCTOR: How thoughtful. Bread and water. 
1135,"SARAH: It's better than nothing, I suppose. I'm dying for a drink. "
1136,(Sarah pours a glass of the water. Harry takes hold of the Doctor.) 
1137,HARRY: You're to come with me. 
1138,DOCTOR: Careful! You androids don't know your own strength. 
1139,SARAH: Where are you taking him? Doctor!Â 
1140,"DOCTOR: Don't worry, Sarah. And don't waste the water. Remember, it's"
1141,an excellent conductor. 
1142,"(The door closes. Sarah pauses, then pours the water back into the"
1143,jug.)
1144,
1145, [Styggron's lab]
1146,
1147, DOCTOR: So this is where you put Crayford
1148,together. Careless of you to lose his eye. 
1149,"STYGGRON: Harry, I have little time. "
1150,"DOCTOR: Going somewhere, are you? "
1151,"STYGGRON: Yes, Doctor. "
1152,"DOCTOR: Yes, well. "
1153,"(The Doctor tries to make a break for it, but Harry and a group of"
1154,soldiers take an appendage each and dump him on the operating table.) 
1155,STYGGRON: Secure his limbs! 
1156,"(In the brig, Sarah lifts a power cable out of the hole under the floor"
1157,"panel. Happily, it has a coupling right where she needs it, so she"
1158,takes it apart and holds it at arms length. 
1159,"The Doctor is fastened down, so Harry and the soldiers leave.) "
1160,"STYGGRON: In a moment, Doctor, the knowledge and experience of your"
1161,entire life will be transposed into our data bank. 
1162,DOCTOR: That's stealing. 
1163,STYGGRON: While you are making your small contribution to Kraal
1164,"culture, I shall be on my way to destroy the humans that you have so"
1165,"often defended. This time, you will be powerless to help them. "
1166,DOCTOR: So you do intend genocide. 
1167,STYGGRON: Earth's resources are limited. They cannot be wasted
1168,supporting an inferior species. 
1169,"DOCTOR: How do you intend to destroy the humans, Styggron? If you use"
1170,"nuclear weapons, you'll raise Earth's radiation level beyond your own"
1171,point of tolerance. 
1172,STYGGRON: Nothing so crude as fission weapons. The androids will
1173,disseminate a virus. It will cause a contagion so lethal the Earth will
1174,be rid of its human population within three weeks. Then it will burn
1175,"itself out, and the world will be ours. "
1176,DOCTOR: Where will you be all this time? 
1177,STYGGRON: Crayford's rocket will prove an effective quarantine chamber.
1178,I shall remain inside until the virus has done its work. Then I shall
1179,signal Marshall Chedaki to bring in our invasion fleet. 
1180,DOCTOR: The best laid schemes of mice and Kraals gang aft agley. 
1181,STYGGRON: What? 
1182,"DOCTOR: Something will go wrong, Styggron. "
1183,STYGGRON: Nothing will go wrong! 
1184,"(Styggron activates the mind scanner, and the Doctor tenses. "
1185,"Sarah lays the end of the power cable by the door, and pours out the"
1186,water in front of it. Then she takes off her scarf and gets out a box
1187,of matches. Soon smoke comes out underneath the door into the corridor.
1188,"Adams opens it to investigate. He enters, stands on the damp patch, and"
1189,"Sarah jabs the power cable at him. He writhes then goes bang, staggers"
1190,forward and collapses. His head explodes. Sarah makes her escape.) 
1191,"STYGGRON: In eight minutes, Doctor, the Analyser will have completed"
1192,"its recording. Unfortunately, I shall not be here to turn it off. Your"
1193,"brain tissue will expand under the stimulation until eventually, your"
1194,skull bursts. I imagine it will be a most disagreeable death. 
1195,DOCTOR: We shall see. 
1196,"STYGGRON: Defiant to the end, Doctor. But you will soon be screaming"
1197,for mercy and there will be no one here. 
1198,"(Styggron leaves. Out in a corridor, Sarah hears the machine working."
1199,She hides as Styggron lumbers past then runs into the lab. Sarah takes
1200,one look then goes to the control panel and turns the Analyser down.
1201,"She pushes another control, but that just ramps it up again so she"
1202,quickly reverses it. Finally it stops and she goes to free him.) 
1203,"SARAH: Doctor. Doctor, come on! Come on, wake up, Doctor! Come on!"
1204,"Doctor, please, come on. Wake up. "
1205,"DOCTOR: I am awake, I think. "
1206,SARAH: Shush. 
1207,"DOCTOR: Shush, shush, shush. Once upon a time, there were three"
1208,"sisters, and they lived at the bottom of a treacle well. Their names"
1209,"were Olga, Masha, and Elena. Are you listening, Tilly? "
1210,SARAH: I'm Sarah. 
1211,DOCTOR: What? 
1212,SARAH: Sarah! 
1213,DOCTOR: I feel disorientated. 
1214,SARAH: This is the Disorientation Centre. 
1215,DOCTOR: That makes sense. 
1216,SARAH: Come on! 
1217,"CHEDAKI : Clear the launching area. Time to countdown, one minute. "
1218,DOCTOR: Hurry! 
1219,SARAH: Where are we going? 
1220,"DOCTOR: Crayford's ship. It'll be leaving in a moment. Right, right. "
1221,SARAH: Doctor! 
1222,(They run through the ship.)

1233,SARAH: What? 
1234,"DOCTOR: I said, you and I are going into that rocket! "

1241,on blast off. Come on.
1242,"(They open a pod, which contains a man.) "
1243,DOCTOR: It's all right. It's not activated.

1258,"SARAH: It's okay, I'm in. Hurry! "
1259,"CHEDAKI : One, zero. (The acceleration throws the Doctor onto his"
1260,back.)

1266,(The rocket hurtles up through the atmosphere
1267,towards space. The Doctor taps Sarah's nose to wake her.) 
1268,DOCTOR: We're on the way. 
1269,SARAH: I must have blacked out. 
1270,"DOCTOR: Yes, you did. The G-force cut the blood supply to what you"
1271,humans laughingly call your higher centres. 
1272,"(On the other side of the hold, a second Doctor lifts the lid of a pod,"
1273,"looks out, then closes it again.) "
1274,"SARAH: Ha ha. I hate sarcasm, especially when I'm dying. I feel as"
1275,though I've been through a mangle. 
1276,DOCTOR: It was a gentle massage compared to what's ahead. 
1277,"SARAH: Oh, no, don't tell me. I don't want to know. "
1278,"DOCTOR: Yes, you do. Just before Crayford puts the ship into re-entry"
1279,"orbit, these containers will be shot out like pips from a lemon. "
1280,SARAH: How? 
1281,DOCTOR: Through the cargo shuttle ejectors. And we'll be in them. 
1282,SARAH: Oh. 
1283,DOCTOR: Ask me why. 
1284,SARAH: Why? 
1285,DOCTOR: Because they'll reach Earth before the ship. There's no other
1286,way we can warn the Defence Station. 
1287,SARAH: And what are we going to use for air? 
1288,"DOCTOR: Oh, there'll be enough to last the few minutes in space. I'm"
1289,more concerned about the efficiency of these retro tubes. 
1290,"SARAH: Why, don't they work? "
1291,"DOCTOR: Oh, I imagine they'll work well enough for the androids to"
1292,"survive impact, but we could be in for a nasty jolt. "
1293,"SARAH: So, providing we don't burn up on re-entry, and aren't"
1294,"suffocated on the way down, we'll probably be smashed to a pulp when we"
1295,land. 
1296,"DOCTOR: Exactly. Sarah, you've put your finger on the one tiny flaw in"
1297,our plan. 
1298,SARAH: Our plan? It's your plan. 
1299,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm open to suggestions if you've got a better idea. "
1300,SARAH: How long before we start all this? 
1301,(The Doctor listens to the change in the rocket note.) 
1302,DOCTOR: Quite soon. They're beaming us through the space time warp now.

1365,FARADAY: What's that? Re-entry? 
1366,"GRIERSON: Not yet, sir. There's something else coming in on the same"
1367,path. 
1368,FARADAY: Something else? 
1369,"GRIERSON: There's a fireball or something. It's broken into meteorites,"

1371,(The screen shows a cluster of dots over the mouth of the Severn. In
1372,"the rocket's hold, the pods are lowered through the floor, presumably"
1373,to be launched.) 
1374,TESSA: They're down to seventeen thousand metres. 
1375,FARADAY: Never mind the meteorites. Have we still got contact with the
1376,ship? 
1377,"GRIERSON: He's just hit the upper atmosphere, sir. It looks like a"
1378,perfect re-entry path. 
1379,MATTHEWS: He'll be back in the mess in time for late breakfast. 
1380,"HARRY: No, he won't, Matthews. Not after two years in space. "
1381,MATTHEWS: That meteorite shower's really coming in. 
1382,"BENTON: Yes, but don't they usually burn up before they hit the Earth? "
1383,MATTHEWS: This lot's not going to. There's something funny about them. 
1384,(The map shows them heading inland towards Oxfordshire.) 
1385,FARADAY: Something funny? 
1386,MATTHEWS: I swear they're slowing down.

1427,taps her on the shoulder.) 
1428,"SARAH: Oh! Doctor, don't do things like that. "
1429,"DOCTOR: I'm sorry. I had to be sure. You see, there's a replica of you"
1430,around somewhere. 
1431,"SARAH: Well, my replica wouldn't be as glad to see you as I am. "
1432,(There's a rocket noise overhead.)

1434,DOCTOR: The rocket is coming in to land. 
1435,"SARAH: Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to warn them. "
1436,DOCTOR: It would suit our purposes better if no one was warned. 
1437,"(The pod behind them opens, and another Sarah sits up. The 'Doctor' has"

1486,"ADAMS: What? Yes, sir. "

1504,"GRIERSON: I can't do that, sir. "
1505,DOCTOR: Call him down.

1507,GRIERSON: Hello? 
1508,(The Doctor takes the microphone from Grierson.) 
1509,"DOCTOR: Give it to me. Harry? Harry, can you hear me? "
1510,"HARRY : Hello, Doctor. Is that you? "
1511,"DOCTOR: Yes, it is. Don't go into that rocket. "
1512,FARADAY : I don't understand. What the Dickens is going on? 
1513,"DOCTOR: Just trust me, Colonel. If you go into that rocket, your lives"
1514,will be in deadly danger. 
1515,FARADAY : Chap's insane. 
1516,"HARRY : I think we ought to do as he says, Colonel. "
1517,"DOCTOR: Harry, bring the lift down. I'll explain it all then. "
1518,"FARADAY : Very well, Doctor, but the explanation had better be"

1535,
1536, [SDC Scanner room]
1537,
1538,(The Doctor completes his circuit diagram.) 
1539,DOCTOR: Could you do that? 
1540,"GRIERSON: Well, it's possible. It would take a bit of time, though. I'd"
1541,have to re-jig about eleven circuits there. 
1542,"DOCTOR: All right. Well, you get about it. "
1543,GRIERSON: You can't 
1544,DOCTOR: Tell no one what you're doing. 
1545,"GRIERSON: You can't point the radar dishes down here, sir! They'd jam"
1546,every radio and electronic equipment for miles. There'd be chaos. 
1547,"DOCTOR: Nothing like the chaos there'll be if you don't do it,"
1548,Grierson. 
1549,(Faraday and Harry enter.) 
1550,FARADAY: Doctor! What the devil's going on? 
1551,"DOCTOR: An invasion of Earth is going on, Colonel. "
1552,FARADAY: What? 
1553,DOCTOR: Let's go to your office. You've got some important phone calls
1554,to make. Crayford's sold you out to the Kraals. 
1555,FARADAY: Kraals? Never heard of them. 
1556,[Faraday's office]

1558," HARRY: You've actually seen these androids, then,"

1562,"HARRY: Sir, they may already be among us. "
1563,"DOCTOR: They've made replicas of you and Harry, Colonel. "
1564,FARADAY: Of me? 
1565,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1566,FARADAY: Confounded cheek. How dare they! 
1567,"HARRY: Colonel, I think I should run a complete medical check on"
1568,everyone. 
1569,"FARADAY: Good idea, Sullivan. That'll nail 'em, eh, Doctor? "
1570,"DOCTOR: Yes, but it would take too long. We can use this. "
1571,(The Doctor takes a small thin box with a red light on it out of his
1572,pocket.) 
1573,HARRY: What's that? 
1574,DOCTOR: It's a robot detector. It lights up in the presence of
1575,androids. 
1576,(It lights up.) 
1577,FARADAY: Thing must be faulty. 
1578,DOCTOR: I don't think so. I see I was just too late. 
1579,DOCTOR 2: A pity you had to find out. 
1580,"(The fake Doctor is in the doorway, pointing a gun at him.) "
1581,DOCTOR 2: We didn't want any shooting until our takeover was complete. 
1582,"DOCTOR: Hello, Doctor. We've been waiting for you. "
1583,"DOCTOR 2: Stand back, Doctor. "
1584,"DOCTOR: You know, the resemblance is astonishing. For a moment, I"
1585,thought I was seeing double. 
1586,(The Doctor slams the door shut on the android then leaps head first
1587,out of Faraday's window.)

1595," FARADAY 2: Attention, attention. "
1596, [SDC reception] 
1597, FARADAY 2 : It has been confirmed the Doctor
1598,is attempting to sabotage our defence system. He is at large somewhere
1599,inside the complex.
1600,
1601,[SDC]
1602,
1603, FARADAY 2 : Saturation search will begin at
1604,"once. He is armed and dangerous, and all personnel have the authority"
1605,to shoot on sight. That is all. 
1606,SARAH: So the androids have taken over. 
1607,DOCTOR: Looks like. 
1608,SARAH: What about the real Harry and Colonel Faraday? 
1609,DOCTOR: They must be up there in the rocket with Styggron. 
1610,(They look round the corner of a building at the rocket sitting high
1611,above them.) 
1612,SARAH: We've got to help them somehow. 
1613,DOCTOR: Our only chance is to stop the androids before they take over
1614,the complex. 
1615,SARAH: Where are you going? 
1616,"DOCTOR: To the scanner room. You stay here, Sarah."
1617,
1618, [SDC reception]
1619,
1620," BENTON 2: Hold it, Doctor. "
1621,"DOCTOR: Don't be a fool, Benton, I'm one of you. Didn't you hear the"
1622,"Colonel just now? The Doctor's not here, he's at large somewhere in the"
1623,complex. 
1624,"BENTON 2: Oh yes, of course, sir. I'm sorry, sir. "
1625,"DOCTOR: That's all right, Benton, but keep your wits about you. Nobody"
1626,knows who's who around here.

1640,DOCTOR 2: Satisfied? 
1641,"BENTON 2: But I, but I thought you were. He passed me just a minute"
1642,ago. 
1643,DOCTOR 2: Which way did he go? 
1644,BENTON 2: To the scanner room.

1648, GRIERSON: There. I've done it. 
1649,(Grierson puts the circuit board in place and the radar dish moves
1650,down.)

1652,DOCTOR: Good. 
1653,"(But before he can press the button labelled Radar Power, he is shot.) "
1654,"DOCTOR 2: A clever way to jam android circuits, but not quick enough. "
1655,CRAYFORD: What's going on? 
1656,DOCTOR 2: The Doctor has interfered in our plans for the last time. 
1657,CRAYFORD: But Styggron promised me there would be no killing. 
1658,DOCTOR 2: Fool. Do you really think the Kraals will spare humanity?
1659,"Styggron has a virus in your ship that will destroy every man, woman"
1660,and child in the world. 
1661,"CRAYFORD: Styggron wouldn't do that. He's a surgeon, a genius. Look"
1662,what he did for me! 
1663,"DOCTOR: He did nothing for you, Crayford. Absolutely nothing at all."
1664,Except brainwash you. 
1665,CRAYFORD: That's not true. 
1666,"DOCTOR: You were hijacked by the Kraals, Crayford. Nothing went wrong"
1667,"with your rocket, Crayford. You weren't even injured. Take off the eye"
1668,patch and look for yourself. 
1669,(Crayford walks over to a mirror on the wall. He rips off the eye patch
1670,then storms back to the lift to the rocket. The Doctor kicks the gun

1715,STYGGRON: The enterprising Earth girl! No! Don't move. The sensors
1716,indicated an intruder. I hardly expected to find it was you.

1723,to be destroyed by this virus.

1727,CRAYFORD: Styggron! You have betrayed me. 
1728,"STYGGRON: Betrayed you? I used you, Crayford, as I use the androids,"
1729,but you are no longer of any value. 
1730,(Crayford attacks Styggron and the virus container falls to the floor.
