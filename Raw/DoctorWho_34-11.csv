21,(Danny Pink walks past the magnificent war memorial in
22,"Alexandra Gardens, Cathays Park, Cardiff whilst pretending to be in Shoreditch, London. His mobile phone rings.)"
23,DANNY: Clara! 
24,CLARA : Shut up.
25,DANNY: Is that how we communicate now?
26,
27,[Clara's flat]
28,
29,"CLARA: Shut up, shut up, shut up. I need to talk to you. "
30,
31,[Park]
32,
33,"DANNY: All right. Well, I'll be there in a couple of minutes, so "
34,
35,[Clara's flat]
36,
37,"No, no, Not while you're in the room. "
38,
39,[Park]
40,
41,"DANNY: Oh, stupid me. The very idea."
42,
43,[Clara's flat]
44,
45,CLARA: Shut up! 
46,DANNY : Okay.
47,CLARA: Stay shut up.
48,
49,
50,[Park]
51,
52,DANNY: Okay.
53,CLARA : Things to say. 
54,
55,[Clara's flat]
56,
57,CLARA: Not all of them good.
58,"DANNY : Oh, wouldn't it be better "
59,
60,[Park]
61,
62,DANNY: If I was actually there? 
63,"CLARA : Oh, Danny, everything is "
64,
65,[Clara's flat]
66,
67,"CLARA: Better when you're here, but maybe "
68,(She turns to look at the array of post-it notes on her bookshelves.
69,"Some say PSI, Impossible Girl, Saibra, Vastra, Blinovitch, Robin Hood,"
70,"Lying, Dinosaur in London.)"
71,"CLARA: Maybe not this. Okay  Er. Okay, before all of that."
72,Before all of the stuff
73,
74,
75,[Park]
76,
77,CLARA : That I did wrong 
78,
79,[Clara's flat]
80,
81,(She takes down the note that says Just Say
82,It.)
83,CLARA: I love you. 
84,
85,[Road]
86,
87,DANNY: I love you.
88,
89,(Danny is walking out towards the main road.)
90,"CLARA: No,"
91,not like that.
92,Not like it's automatic.
93,
94,[Clara's flat]
95,
96,CLARA: Not like it's how you end
97,"the phone call,"
98,"the sign off, the pat on the back."
99,
100,
101,[Park]
102,
103,DANNY: Clara 
104,
105,[Clara's flat]
106,
107,"CLARA: Danny, I'll never say those words"
108,"again. Not to anybody else, ever."
109,"Those words, from me, are yours now."
110,(Danny walks out onto the main road. Clara doesn't get a reply so after
111,a pause -)
112,"CLARA: So, er. That's a thing. "
113,(Just the sound of cars travelling on the road.)
114,"CLARA: Okay, Danny? Er, there's more but that's kind of the headline."
115,"Okay, Danny, please speak to me,"
116,"This is, this is killing me."
117,
118,(Still nothing.)
119,"CLARA: Danny, I love you. And you are the last person who's"
120,ever going to hear me say that.
121,
122,WOMAN : Hello?
123,"Hello, is someone there?"
124,"CLARA: Hello? Er, yeah. Who's this?"
125,WOMAN : I just
126,"picked up the phone,"
127,I'm sorry. I found it.
128,
129,"CLARA: Oh. Er, okay. Er, can you please just put me"
130,back on the phone to Danny?
131,I was talking to Danny.
132,WOMAN : I'm
133,sorry. I'm so sorry.
134,"CLARA: Okay, er, what are you sorry about? Could you please just pass"
135,the phone back to 
136,WOMAN : He
137,"was crossing the road. 'I found the phone,"
138,"it must have just got thrown. The car, it just came out"
139,of nowhere.
140,
141,[Road]
142,
143,WOMAN: I'm so sorry.
144,"(The traffic is at a standstill. People have stopped to look, and the"
145,"emergency services are on their way, sirens wailing. Clara drops the"
146,phone and runs along the street. She gets there just as the police are
147,taping the scene off.)
148,
149,"ARMITAGE : By now, I'm sure you've heard"
150,"the rumours, and it is with great sadness that"
151,I must confirm them to be true.
152,
153,"(A little shrine with photographs, notes and flowers is set up at the"
154,park entrance.)
155,ARMITAGE : I have gathered you all here
156,"today to say that Mister Pink, that Danny Pink has"
157,sadly passed away. I'm sure you'll all join me
158,in wishing his family and friends our sincerest condolences. Mister
159,Pink was an inspiration
160,"to all of those who knew him. A soldier, a teacher, a friend. It was no"
161,secret that he had a
162,"close relationship with Miss Oswald, and our thoughts and prayers are"
163,with her too.
164,(The Tardis is sitting on a ledge in a volcanic caldera.)
165,
166,[Clara's kitchen]
167,
168,(Full
169,"of Calla lilies and sympathy cards. Her phone is ringing, and continues"
170,to ring throughout the scene. Caller ID says it is The Doctor calling.
171,Clara's gran walks in.)
172,"GRAN: Hello, love. You all right? Oh, of course you're not. Sorry. Of"
173,course
174,you're not all right.
175,You know what you should do? You should cry. Let go.
176,CLARA: Of what?
177,GRAN: It's a terrible thing. Just a
178,"terrible, terrible thing."
179,
180,CLARA: It wasn't terrible.
181,GRAN: Clara?
182,CLARA: It was boring.
183,GRAN: Boring?
184,CLARA: It was ordinary. People just kept walking with
185,their iPods and their shopping bags.
186,"He was alive, and then he was dead"
187,and it was nothing.
188,Like stepping off a bus.
189,GRAN: He deserved better. And so did you.
190,CLARA: I don't deserve anything.
191,Nobody deserves anything.
192,But I am owed better. I am owed.
193,GRAN: Who owes you?
194,DOCTOR : Clara! Clara?
195,"(Clara picks up the phone and puts on a cheerful face. So, she was"
196,actually calling him?)
197,CLARA: Hey!
198,
199,[Tardis]
200,
201,(The Doctor enters.)
202,"DOCTOR: Sorry, I was busy. What's happening?"
203,
204,[Clara's kitchen]
205,
206,"CLARA: Oh, nothing. You know, same old,"
207,same old.
208,
209,
210,[Tardis]
211,
212,"DOCTOR: Well, you're only human."
213,
214,[Clara's kitchen]
215,
216,"DOCTOR : So what I can do for you, Clara?"
217,
218,[Cauldera]
219,
220,(The
221,Doctor is lying outside the Tardis as the volcano spits lava and lumps
222,of rock. He wakes with a start to see Clara standing in the smoke by
223,the edge of the ledge.)
224,DOCTOR: Clara?
225,
226,[Tardis]
227,
228,(Clara enters. The Doctor is working on a piece of machinery.)
229,CLARA: Start her up. 
230,DOCTOR: Where are we going?
231,
232,CLARA: Away.
233,
234,DOCTOR: From? 
235,CLARA: Just away.
236,
237,"DOCTOR: Well, normally you say work or"
238,kids or dishes or dullness.
239,So what's happened?
240,"(Clara goes downstairs to his workbench, takes a key from a round box"
241,and puts it in her coat pocket.)
242,CLARA: A volcano. 
243,DOCTOR: I'm sorry?
244,
245,CLARA: I've never seen an active
246,"volcano, do you know one?"
247,
248,DOCTOR: What's so great about
249,seeing a volcano?
250,It's just a sort of leaky mountain.
251,
252,CLARA: I've never seen lava.
253,
254,(She takes something out of his coat pocket and puts it into hers.)
255,DOCTOR: It's rubbish.
256,CLARA: Prove it.
257,
258,[Cauldera]
259,
260,CLARA: It's on your neck.
261,
262,[Tardis]
263,
264,(In flight. Clara finds another key hidden inside The
265,"Time Traveller's Wife. Good book, interesting concept.)"
266,CLARA: Do you still have those
267,sleep patch things?
268,
269,DOCTOR: You can't have one.
270,
271,CLARA: I'm having trouble sleeping.
272,
273,DOCTOR: You still can't have one.
274,
275,CLARA: Can I have one?
276,
277,"DOCTOR: No, you can't have one."
278,(So Clara takes the box of them from a small set of drawers.)
279,"DOCTOR: So, volcano. What's so good about lava?"
280,(Clara puts one of the patches on the back of the Doctor's neck.)
281,
282,[Cauldera]
283,
284,(Clara is holding out her hand.)
285,CLARA: You told me once what it would
286,take to destroy a Tardis key.
287,That's what's so good about lava. All seven. From all of
288,your hiding places.
289,
290,(She holds one up.)
291,"DOCTOR: Clara, what are you doing? Don't. Be very, very careful with"
292,"that. Those are very, very "
293,(She throws it backwards into the lava.)
294,CLARA: Do I have your attention?
295,DOCTOR: Yes. 
296,CLARA: Good.
297,
298,"DOCTOR: No. Not good, Clara."
299,CLARA: Danny Pink.
300,DOCTOR: Yeah?
301,CLARA: Is dead.
302,DOCTOR: And?
303,CLARA: Seriously? 
304,DOCTOR: And?
305,
306,CLARA: And fix it. Change it. Change what happened. Save him. Bring him
307,back.
308,(She holds up another key and we all remember what happened in Father's
309,Day.)
310,DOCTOR: No.
311,(She throws the key away.)
312,"CLARA: Five left. Every time you say no to me, I will"
313,throw another key down there.
314,Do we understand each other?
315,"DOCTOR: Well, I understand you. Let's not get carried away."
316,
317,CLARA: Time can be rewritten.
318,DOCTOR: With precision. With great care. And not today. But you know
319,"that of course, otherwise you wouldn't"
320,be threatening me.
321,
322,CLARA: Did you just say no?
323,DOCTOR: If I change the events
324,"that brought you here,"
325,you will never come here and
326,ask me to change those events.
327,Paradox loop. The timeline disintegrates.
328,Your timeline. And yes!
329,
330,CLARA: Yes? 
331,DOCTOR: Yes. I did just say no. Throw away the key.
332,"CLARA: I have seen you change time, I have"
333,seen you break any rule you want.
334,
335,"DOCTOR: I know when I can, I know"
336,when I can't. Throw the key.
337,
338,CLARA: I know what you're doing.
339,You're trying to take control.
340,
341,DOCTOR: I am in control. Throw away the key. Do as you are told. 
342,CLARA: No!
343,
344,"DOCTOR: Well, either you do as you're told"
345,or stop threatening me.
346,There really isn't
347,a third option here.
348,
349,"CLARA: Do you know what, Doctor? When it comes to taking control, you"
350,really are out of your depth.
351,(She throws all the remaining keys bar one into the lava.)
352,"CLARA: One last chance. And I don't care about the rules, I don't give"
353,a damn about paradoxes. Save Danny. Bring him back
354,or I swear you will never step inside
355,your Tardis again.
356,
357,DOCTOR: No. 
358,CLARA: Do as you are told.
359,
360,DOCTOR: No. 
361,CLARA: Say it again so I know
362,you mean it. 
363,DOCTOR: No!
364,
365,"CLARA: I'm not kidding, Doctor. "
366,DOCTOR: Neither am I. 
367,CLARA: I will do it!
368,
369,"DOCTOR: Clara, my Clara,"
370,I don't think you will!
371,
372,(The last key goes into the lava.)
373,"CLARA: Oh, I'd say I'm sorry"
374,but I'd do it again.
375,
376,(Clara falls to her knees and cries.)
377,"CLARA: I'd do it again. Well, what are you doing?"
378,Why are you just standing there?
379,Do you understand
380,what I have just done?
381,
382,DOCTOR: Look in your hand.
383,
384,CLARA: There's nothing in my hand.
385,
386,"DOCTOR: Clara, look in your hand. "
387,"CLARA: The keys,"
388,they're gone. They're down there.
389,They've gone.
390,"DOCTOR: Clara, look in your hand."
391,
392,CLARA: There's nothing in my hand.
393,
394,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, there is. Look."
395,(The sleep patch is in the middle of Clara's palm.)
396,DOCTOR: Did you seriously think that
397,that was going to work on me?
398,
399,"(And back into the Tardis, to when Clara put the patch on the"
400,Doctor's neck. He grabs her hand and neatly presses the patch into her
401,palm instead.)
402,DOCTOR: They're not sleep patches. They induce a dream state. 
403,(He removes the patch from her palm.)
404,
405,[Tardis]
406,
407,DOCTOR: Makes you very suggestible.
408,(He picks up the Tardis keys from the floor.)
409,DOCTOR: I allowed the whole scenario
410,to play out just as you planned.
411,I was curious about how far
412,you would go.
413,
414,"CLARA: Well, now you know."
415,
416,DOCTOR: Yeah. Now I know.
417,CLARA:I love him.
418,(The Doctor scans her with the sonic screwdriver.)
419,"DOCTOR: Yes, you're quite the mess"
420,"of chemicals, aren't you?"
421,
422,"CLARA: So, what now? What do we do now? You and me,"
423,what happens now?
424,Doctor?
425,DOCTOR: Go to hell.
426,(The Tardis lands.)
427,CLARA: Fair enough. Absolutely fair enough.
428,(She walks to the door.)
429,DOCTOR: Clara? You asked me what we're going to do.
430,I told you.
431,We're going to hell. Or wherever it is people go
432,when they die. If there is anywhere.
433,"Wherever it is, we're going to go"
434,there and we're going to find Danny.
435,"And if it is in any way possible,"
436,we're going to bring him home.
437,Almost every culture in the universe
438,has some concept of an afterlife.
439,I always meant to have a look
440,"around, see if I could find one."
441,
442,CLARA: You're going to help me?
443,
444,"DOCTOR: Well, why wouldn't I help you?"
445,
446,CLARA: Because of what I just did. I just 
447,DOCTOR: You betrayed me.
448,"Betrayed my trust,"
449,"you betrayed our friendship,"
450,you betrayed everything that I've
451,ever stood for. You let me down!
452,
453,CLARA: Then why are you helping me?
454,DOCTOR: Why? Do you think I care for you
455,so little that betraying me
456,would make a difference? Stop it with the eyes.
457,Don't do that with the eyes.
458,How do you do that anyway?
459,It's like they inflate.
460,Cut out the whining
461,while you're at it.
462,"We've got work to do. This is it,"
463,"Clara, one of those moments."
464,
465,CLARA: What moments? 
466,DOCTOR: The darkest day.
467,"The blackest hour. Chin up, shoulders back."
468,"Let's see what we're made of,"
469,"you and I. Switching off the safeguards,"
470,turning off the nav-com.
471,"Remember, we did this before. We plugged you into the"
472,Tardis telepathic interface.
473,
474,CLARA: We ended up all over
475,Danny's timestream.
476,
477,DOCTOR: Because you and he are linked. Strongly linked.
478,"Your timestreams are intertwined. So if he's anywhere at all, that"
479,link will hold. Give me your hands.
480,
481,CLARA: Doctor 
482,DOCTOR: We're in a hurry.
483,
484,CLARA: I don't deserve a friend like you.
485,"DOCTOR: Clara, I'm terribly sorry, but"
486,I'm exactly what you deserve.
487,
488,(He puts her hands into the orange gloop part of the console.)
489,DOCTOR: Think about Danny. Think about
490,the man you lost.
491,Let it hurt. Let it burn.
492,But don't bleat.
493,"Don't ask, why him? Why me? Forget"
494,all that. Ask one question.
495,"Just one. Ask, where is Danny Pink now?"
496,Where is he now?
497,
498,"(And after a few moments, the time rotor starts up.)"
499,"DOCTOR: Well, the Tardis thinks he's somewhere."
500,
501,[Seb's office]
502,
503,(Danny is sitting
504,at a desk with his head resting on his hand. It slips and he wakes.
505,"Somewhere a phone rings, and it sounds like a busy office outside. He"
506,"looks around at a set of in-trays, pens in holders, and a name plate on"
507,the desk which says - Nethersphere After Death Department
508, SEB.
509,The company logo is a very large circle with a small one attached at
510,seven o'clock. The door opens.)
511,SEB: Has anyone offered you a coffee?
512,"DANNY: Um.  Well, no."
513,SEB: Could we have some coffee
514,"along here, please?"
515,The good kind. We've got a new one. 
516,(Seb shuts the door and sits at his desk.)
517,"SEB: Five minutes, tops. Best to wait"
518,for the good coffee.
519,
520,DANNY: Where am I? 
521,SEB: Sometimes it's
522,just the instant. 
523,(Seb pulls a 'nasty taste' face.)
524,DANNY: Where am I?
525,"SEB: Well, big question. Try to take that one slowly. We have been"
526,trying
527,"to contact family members,"
528,but really there is so much admin 
529,"DANNY: I wasn't here, I was "
530,SEB: Yeah. That last thing
531,"that happened to you,"
532,"that really happened, I'm afraid. But that's life. Well, not life, I"
533,"suppose, but. There are some forms to fill in."
534,Might help you relax.
535,
536,"Well, they won't, but we do"
537,need them filled in.
538,"Right, important thing."
539,Need to know.
540,"Are you being cremated? Sorry, it's a fairly"
541,urgent question.
542,
543,DANNY: I don't know. I've never really
544,thought of that.
545,
546,SEB: I'm going to put you down
547,"as a yes,"
548,that's pretty much
549,the default these days.
550,If people only knew. 
551,DANNY: Only knew what? 
552,(Seb rolls his chair back to the door and shouts through the wall.)
553,"SEB: We've got a burner in number twelve. Tell them to prep, please."
554,
555,DANNY: Burner?
556,
557,(Seb rolls back to the deck.)
558,"SEB: Yeah, it's fine, we'll come to that."
559,DANNY: But I don't understand where I am.
560,(Seb
561,looks at the large pair of curtains covering one wall. Danny gets up
562,"and opens them, then gasps. He is looking out of a round window at a"
563,host of buildings which appear to be on the inside of a small Dyson
564,Sphere.)
565,"SEB: Oh, look at that."
566,You can see my house from here.
567,"Yeah, sorry, probably not helping."
568,DANNY: Where am I? Er.
569,"SEB:  You sort of know, don't you? Most people kind of know,"
570,it's just
571,hard to get traction on the concept.
572,
573,DANNY: Where am I?
574,"SEB: Okay. You're dead, and this is what's next."
575,DANNY: I'm not dead. How can I be dead?
576,
577,SEB: Our sincere condolences.
578,
579,DANNY: I'm standing right here.
580,
581,"SEB: Yes, you are."
582,"Welcome to the Underworld. Otherwise known as the Nethersphere,"
583,or the Promised Land.
584,It's where you go when you die.
585,(Danny starts to hyperventilate.)
586,SEB: Would you like to breathe
587,into a bag?
588,
589,
590,[Tardis]
591,
592,(The Tardis materialises.)
593,CLARA: Where are we?
594,DOCTOR: Nav-com's offline. We'll have
595,to do this old school.
596,
597,CLARA: But this is where Danny is?
598,DOCTOR: Almost certainly not. It's where
599,there's a connection with Danny.
600,"According to the Tardis, this is"
601,where it's most likely that
602,your timeline will re-intersect
603,with his. And that won't do.
604,

606,DOCTOR: You won't. Look at you.

608,I don't need mopey.
609,It put years on your face.
610,And what if people see us together?
611,It looks like you've been melted.
612,
613,CLARA: Are you forgetting why we're here?
614,
615,DOCTOR: We're here to get your boyfriend
616,"back from the dead,"
617,so buck up and
618,give me some attitude.

626,"eternal flame burning in it. The place is dark, and the Doctor shines a"
627,torch on an small obelisk with the Company logo on it in gold and the
628,"words Rest In Peace, We Promise carved into the granite. They look up"
629,at ranks and ranks of glass fronted cubicles on three sides of this marble edifice. There is the sound of
630,water nearby.)
631,CLARA: Fish tanks?
632,DOCTOR: In a mausoleum? 
633,(They go up the steps to the urn. Its plinth also has the logo and
634,motto on it.)
635,CLARA: What does that mean?

646,"CLARA: Okay, I'm assuming they didn't"
647,actually drown in there.
648,
649,"DOCTOR: No. They were placed, after death. These are tombs. Water"

660,that why the Tardis brought us here?
661,I don't want to see him like that.

667,so much trouble just to keep watch on the dead?
668,(As
669,"they walk on, a skeleton turns its head to watch them. The Doctor finds"
670,a small book on a lecturn. He opens his fingers across a blank page and
671,a cube rises up out of it. He pushes it into the corridor and opens it.
672,It displays that two ring logo with 3W inside it while Bach's Air on a
673,G String plays softly. A voice speaks the words that then scroll down.)
674,MISSY : 3W. Death is not an end. But we can we help with
675,that. Ever since 3W encountered the truth
676,"about the death experience,"
677,'we have been working hard to find
678,"a better life for the deceased. At 3W, afterlife means"
679,aftercare. 
680,CLARA: Okay. Bit strange?
681,DOCTOR: Very. Why have the scrolling and a voice? Is it difficult?
682,CLARA: Is what difficult?

684,back to front.
685,Come on. We've come a long way.
686,"(Missy walks through the logo, which disappears.) "

709,"at the Doctor, pushing him against the wall then kissing him very"

792,SEB: And the Wi-Fi
793,is better out here. Don't know why.
794,
795,DANNY: Wi-Fi? 
796,"SEB: Yeah, still a bit spotty,"
797,but basically 
798,DANNY: You have Wi-Fi here? 
799,(Seb is calling something up on his tablet computer.)
800,DANNY: You. You have iPads
801,in the afterlife?
802,
803,"SEB: IPads? We have Steve Jobs. Listen, another big question"
804,for you.
805,Have you ever killed anybody?
806,DANNY: This is surreal.
807,SEB: Imagine embryos had telephones.
808,DANNY: That's really not helping.
809,
810,SEB: Go with me. Go with me.
811,Imagine babies in wombs could talk
812,to other babies in other wombs.
813,What would they say? What would they think life was like
814,if they could talk among themselves?
815,
816,DANNY: I really have no idea.
817,SEB: They'd think that life was
818,nine months long.
819,"Then, boom, trap door opens,"
820,"out you fall, gone for ever."
821,Never hear from those guys again. Nothing at the end of the cord.
822,DANNY: Okay.
823,SEB: This isn't really an afterlife. It's just more life
824,than you were expecting.
825,
826,DANNY: Why did you ask me
827,if I'd killed anyone?
828,
829,"SEB: Before you were a teacher,"
830,you spent some time as a soldier.
831,
832,"DANNY: Yeah, so?"
833,SEB: Any regrets? Bad memories?
834,"DANNY: Is that, is that any of your business?"
835,SEB: Yes.

843,
844,SEB: Sorry if I triggered something then. Memory
845,flashes can be very impactful
846,in the early stages.
847,
848,DANNY: Why?
849,SEB: Why what?
850,(Danny recalls taking a grenade from his pouch and throwing it into the
851,remains of a building.)
852,DANNY: Why is it any of your business?
853,SEB: We've had a request to meet you. Any idea who that would be from? 
854,(Danny recalls bursting into a building and immediately opening fire.)
855,"SEB: It's been given a priority,"
856,which usually means 
857,DANNY: Means what? 
858,(Danny has shot someone.)
859,"SEB: Well, anyway, we've arranged"
860,a meet-up.
861,
862,DANNY: When?
863,SEB: Come in.
864,(Danny sees the person from his memories. A young boy in a football
865,shirt is peering around the door.)

877,a look around.)

897,so we can see the tank resident
898,unimpeded by the
899,support mechanisms.

929,they wouldn't have let you in.
930,Sorry. Should have checked.
931,Who are you?

946,DOCTOR: Never mind
947,"what we know and what we don't know,"
948,just answer our question.
949,"CHANG: Because people who don't know,"
950,"when they hear about this,"
951,they can freak out.
952,
953,DOCTOR: We're not going to freak out.
954,
955,"CHANG: If you've had a recent loss,"
956,"this might be, this will be disturbing."
957,DOCTOR: She'll be fine. 
958,"CLARA: Speak for me again,"
959,I'll detach something from you.
960,I'll be fine.
961,CHANG: You know how people are scared
962,"of dying? Like, everybody."
963,
964,DOCTOR: Of course. It's the most fundamental
965,fear in the universe.
966,
967,CHANG: They'd be a lot more scared if they
968,knew what it was really like.

986,why you're always feeling cold.
987,[Chang's office]
988,
989,CHANG: White noise off the telly.
990,We've all heard it.
991,"A few years ago, Doctor Skarosa,"
992,"our founder,"
993,did something unexpected. He played that noise through
994,a translation matrix
995,of his own devising. This is a recording of what he heard.
996,(A sound wave of multiple voices.)
997,"CLARA: Okay, people, voices. "
998,DOCTOR: So what?
999,
1000,"CHANG: Over time, Doctor Skarosa"
1001,became convinced
1002,these were the voices of
1003,the recently departed.
1004,He believed it was a telepathic
1005,communication from the dead.
1006,
1007,DOCTOR: Why? Was he an idiot?

1019,"all over the world,"
1020,to protect the dead. If you'd rather not hear these
