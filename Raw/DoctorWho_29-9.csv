22,"JENNY: Make your decision, Mister Smith. "
23,"BAINES: Perhaps if that human heart breaks, the Time Lord will emerge. "
24,"(Out of sight, Latimer takes the watch from his pocket, and opens it."
25,Golden energy shimmers and the Family turn their heads quickly.) 
26,VOICE: Time Lord. 
27,BAINES: It's him! 
28,(Latimer closes the watch. Martha gets the gun off Jenny and uses her
29,as a shield while she aims it at Baines.) 
30,MARTHA: All right! One more move and I shoot. 
31,"BAINES: Oh, the maid is full of fire. "
32,MARTHA: And you can shut up! 
33,(She fires the gun at the ceiling.) 
34,"CLARK: Careful, Son of Mine. This is all for you so that you can live"
35,forever. 
36,BAINES: Shoot you down. 
37,MARTHA: Try it. We'll die together. 
38,BAINES: Would you really pull the trigger? Looks too scared. 
39,MARTHA: Scared and holding a gun's a good combination. Do you want to
40,risk it? 
41,(The family lower their guns. Joan returns to the Doctor.) 
42,"MARTHA: Doctor, get everyone out. There's a door at the side. It's over"
43,"there. Go on. Do it, Mister Smith. I mean you. "
44,"JOAN: Do what she said. Everybody out, now. Don't argue, Mister"
45,"Jackson. They're mad. That's all we need to know. Susan, Miss Cooper,"
46,"outside, all of you. "
47,"(The villagers run out, screaming.)Â "
48,"DOCTOR: Move yourself, boy. Back to the school, quickly. "
49,MARTHA: And you. Go on. Just shift. 
50,DOCTOR: What about you? 
51,"MARTHA: Mister Smith, I think you should escort your lady friend to"
52,"safety, don't you?"
53,
54,[Outside the village hall]
55,
56,"DOCTOR: Mister Hicks, warn the village. Get"
57,"everyone out. Latimer, get back to the school. Tell the headmaster "
58,LATIMER: Don't touch me. You're as bad as them. 
59,(Latimer runs off.)
60,
61,[Village hall]
62,
63,(Jenny gets away from Martha and rejoins her
64,Family.) 
65,"MARTHA: Don't try anything. I'm warning you, or Sonny boy gets it. "
66,"BAINES: She's almost brave, this one. "
67,JENNY: I should have taken her form. Much more fun. So much spirit. 
68,(Martha backs away as the Family move forward.) 
69,MARTHA: What happened to Jenny? Is she gone? 
70,JENNY: She is consumed. Her body's mine. 
71,MARTHA: You mean she's dead. 
72,JENNY: Yes. And she went with precious little dignity. All that
73,screaming. 
74,(A scarecrow grabs Martha from behind.) 
75,BAINES: Get the gun! 
76,(The scarecrow takes the gun and Martha runs out of the hall.) 
77,"BAINES: Good work, soldier."
78,
79,[Outside the village hall]
80,
81,"MARTHA: Don't just stand there, move! God, you're"
82,rubbish as a human. Come on! 
83,"(Martha, the Doctor and Joan run.) "
84,"BAINES: Run! Ah, this is super. We've been in hiding for too long. This"
85,is sport. 
86,JENNY: I can smell the schoolteacher. He's gone back to his academy. 
87,BAINES: And what do we know about her? 
88,(Jenny's body glows green.) 
89,JENNY: This body has traces of memory. Was once her friend. Martha
90,"would go walking to the west. Husband of Mine, follow the maid's scent."
91,Go to the west. Find out what she was keeping secret. 
92,CLARK: Soldiers! 
93,(Clark leaves with scarecrows.) 
94,"BAINES: As for you, Mother of Mine, let's go to school."
95,
96,[Farringham School]
97,
98,"(The Doctor closes the main doors behind them,"
99,grabs the bell and starts ringing it.) 
100,MARTHA: What are you doing? 
101,"DOCTOR: Maybe one man can't fight them, but this school teaches us to"
102,stand together. Take arms! Take arms! 
103,MARTHA: You can't do that! 
104,"DOCTOR: You want me to fight, don't you? Take arms! Take arms! "
105,"HUTCHINSON: I say sir, what's the matter? "
106,"DOCTOR: Enemy at the door, Hutchinson. Enemy at the door. Take arms!"
107,
108,[Outside the school]
109,
110,BAINES: They're sounding the alarms. 
111,"JENNY: I wouldn't be so pleased, Son of Mine. These bodies are silly"
112,and hot. They can damage and die. That's why we need the Time Lord. 
113,BAINES: Indeed. They will have guns. Perhaps a little caution. Sister
114,"of Mine, you're such a small little thing. Find a way in and spy on"
115,them.
116,
117,[Farringham School]
118,
119,(The guns are being passed out.) 
120,"MARTHA: You can't do this, Doctor. Mister Smith! "
121,"DOCTOR: Redfern, maintain position over the stable yard. Faster now."
122,That's it. 
123,MARTHA: They're just boys. You can't ask them to fight. They don't
124,stand a chance. 
125,"DOCTOR: They're cadets, Miss Jones. They are trained to defend the King"
126,and all his citizens and properties. 
127,(The Headmaster enters.) 
128,ROCASTLE: What in thunder's name is this? Before I devise an excellent
129,"and endless series of punishments for each and every one of you, could"
130,someone explain very simply and immediately exactly what is going on? 
131,"DOCTOR: Headmaster, I have to report the school is under attack. "
132,ROCASTLE: Really? Is that so? Perhaps you and I should have a word in
133,private. 
134,"DOCTOR: No, I promise you, sir. I was in the village with Matron. It's"
135,"Baines, sir. Jeremy Baines and Mister Clark from Oakham Farm. They've"
136,"gone mad, sir. They've got guns. They've already murdered people in the"
137,village. I saw it happen. 
138,"ROCASTLE: Matron, is that so? "
139,"JOAN: I'm afraid it's true, sir. "
140,ROCASTLE: Murder on our own soil? 
141,JOAN: I saw it. Yes. 
142,"ROCASTLE: Perhaps you did well then, Mister Smith. What makes you thing"
143,the danger's coming here? 
144,"DOCTOR: Well, sir, they said "
145,"JOAN: Baines threatened Mister Smith, sir. Said he'd follow him. We"
146,don't know why. 
147,"ROCASTLE: Very well. You boys, remain on guard. Mister Snell, telephone"
148,"for the police. Mister Philips, with me. We shall investigate. "
149,MARTHA: No! But it's not safe out there. 
150,"ROCASTLE: Mister Smith, it seems your favourite servant is giving me"
151,"advice. You will control her, sir. "
152,(Rocastle and Philips leave.) 
153,MARTHA: I've got to find that watch.
154,
155,[Corridor]
156,
157,"(Joan follows Martha. They pass Latimer, who is"
158,hiding with the watch.) 
159,DOCTOR : Hold me. Keep me safe. Keep me dark. Keep me closed. The
160,time is not right. Not yet. Not while the Family is abroad. Danger! 
161,(Lucy sneaks into the school.)
162,
163,[Outside the school]
164,
165,ROCASTLE: So. Baines and one of the cleaning staff.
166,There's always a woman involved. Am I to gather that some practical
167,joke has got out of hand? 
168,"BAINES: Headmaster, sir. Good evening, sir. Come to give me a caning,"
169,"sir? Would you like that, sir? "
170,"ROCASTLE: Keep a civil tongue, boy. "
171,"PHILIPS: Now come on, everyone. I suspect alcohol has played its part"
172,in this. 
173,(The Doctor watches from a window.) 
174,"PHILIPS: Let's all just calm down. And who are these friends of yours,"
175,"Baines, in fancy dress? "
176,"BAINES: Do you like them, Mister Philips? I made them myself. I'm ever"
177,"so good at science, sir. Look. "
178,(He pulls the arm off a scarecrow.) 
179,BAINES: Molecular fringe animation fashioned in the shape of straw men.
180,"My own private army, sir. It's ever so good, sir. "
181,"ROCASTLE: Baines, step apart from this company and come inside with me."
182,
183,"BAINES: No, sir. You, sir, you will send us Mister John Smith. That's"
184,"all we want, sir, Mister John Smith and whatever he's done with his"
185,Time Lord consciousness. Then we'd be very happy to leave you alone. 
186,"ROCASTLE: You speak with someone else's voice, Baines. Who might that"
187,be? 
188,BAINES: We are the Family of Blood. 
189,ROCASTLE: Mister Smith said there had been deaths. 
190,"BAINES: Yes, sir. And they were good, sir. "
191,"ROCASTLE: Well, I warn you, the school is armed. "
192,"BAINES: All your little tin soldiers. But tell me, sir, will they thank"
193,you? 
194,ROCASTLE: I don't understand. 
195,"BAINES: What do you know of history, sir? What do you know of next"
196,year? 
197,"ROCASTLE: You're not making sense, Baines. "
198,"BAINES: 1914, sir. Because the Family has travelled far and wide"
199,"looking for Mister Smith and, oh, the things we have seen. War is"
200,"coming. In foreign fields, war of the whole wide world, with all your"
201,boys falling down in the mud. Do you think they will thank the man who
202,taught them it was glorious? 
203,"ROCASTLE: Don't you forget, boy, I've been a soldier. I was in South"
204,Africa. I used my dead mates for sandbags. I fought with the butt of my
205,"rifle when the bullets ran out, and I would go back there tomorrow for"
206,King and Country! 
207,"BAINES: Et cetera, et cetera. "
208,(Baines vapourises Philips.) 
209,"BAINES: Run along, Headmaster. Run back to school. And send us Mister"
210,Smith!
211,
212,[Farringham School]
213,
214,"ROCASTLE: Mister Philips has been murdered, Mister"
215,Smith. Can you tell me why? 
216,"DOCTOR: Honestly, sir, I have no idea. And the telephone line's been"
217,disconnected. We are on our own. 
218,"ROCASTLE: If we have to make a fight of it, then make a fight we shall."
219,"Hutchinson, we'll build a barricade within the courtyards. Fortify the"
220,"entrances, build our defences. Gentlemen, in the name of the King, we"
221,shall stand against them. 
222,"BOYS: Yes, sir! Right, come on. Let's get moving. "
223,(A wooden beam is put across the main doors.) 
224,"BOY: Hurry, get back. "
225,HUTCHINSON: Barricade the kitchens. Secure the passageway to the
226,stables. 
227,(He drags Latimer out of his hiding place.) 
228,"HUTCHINSON: You coward. You'll do your duty, Latimer, with the rest of"
229,us.
230,
231,[Courtyard]
232,
233,ROCASTLE: Sandbags to the north and west. 
234,DOCTOR: Stables in case of 
235,"ROCASTLE: Pemberton, load the spare magazines with bullets. "
236,"HUTCHINSON: Quickly, now. Take the magazine cut-off out. "
237,(Lucy watches from a window.) 
238,[Outside the school]
239,
240,BAINES: They've got an army. So do we. Soldiers.
241,Soldiers! 
242,(More scarecrows raise their heads and make for the school.)
243,
244,[Courtyard]
245,
246,"ROCASTLE: Ashington, we need water for the Vickers"
247,"gun. See to it. Faster. All of you, faster. "
248,"DOCTOR: Lockley, when firing commences, you're in charge of the"
249,gallery. 
250,"ROCASTLE: Peterson, that is not acceptable. Report to your senior"
251,officer.
252,
253,[Outside the school]
254,
255,(All the scarecrows assemble.) 
256,BAINES: War comes to England a year in advance.
257,
258,[Farringham school]
259,
260,(Lucy contacts the Family telepathically.) 
261,"LUCY : Family of Mine, wait. Hold the soldiers back. The Time Lord"
262,is playing some sort of trick.Â 
263,"BAINES : Discover him, Sister of Mine."
264,
265,[Doctor's study]
266,
267,(Martha is searching while Joan just stands there.)
268,
269,"MARTHA: I know it sounds mad, but when the Doctor became human, he took"
270,the alien part of himself and he stored it inside the watch. It's not
271,"really a watch, it just looks like a watch. "
272,"JOAN: And alien means not from abroad, I take it. "
273,"MARTHA: The man you call John Smith, he was born on another world. "
274,JOAN: A different species. 
275,MARTHA: Yeah. 
276,"JOAN: Then tell me. In this fairy tale, who are you? "
277,"MARTHA: Just a friend. I'm not. I mean, you haven't got a rival, as"
278,much as I might. Just his friend. 
279,"JOAN: And human, I take it? "
280,"MARTHA: Human. Don't worry. And more than that, I just don't follow him"
281,"around. I'm training to be a doctor. Not an alien doctor, a proper"
282,doctor. A doctor of medicine. 
283,"JOAN: Well that certainly is nonsense. Women might train to be doctors,"
284,but hardly a skivvy and hardly one of your colour. 
285,"MARTHA: Oh, do you think? Bones of the hand. Carpal bones, proximal"
286,"row. Scaphoid, lunate, triquetal, pisiform. Distal row. Trapezium,"
287,"trapezoid, capitate, hamate. Then the metacarpal bones extending in"
288,"three distinct phalanges. Proximal, middle, distal. "
289,JOAN: You read that in a book. 
290,"MARTHA: Yes, to pass my exams. Can't you see this is true? "
291,JOAN: I must go. 
292,"MARTHA: If we find that watch, then we can stop them. "
293,"JOAN: Those boys are going to fight. I might not be a doctor, but I'm"
294,still their nurse. They need me. 
295,[Barn]
296,
297,"CLARK: Son of Mine, Wife of Mine."
298,
299,[Outside the school]
300,
301,"BAINES : Father of Mine, what have you found?"
302,
303,[Barn]
304,
305,CLARK: His Tardis. The Doctor can't escape.
306,
307,[Farringham School]
308,
309,(Joan has changed into her uniform.) 
310,"DOCTOR: You're with Armitage and Thwaites. They know the drill. Joan,"
311,it's not safe. 
312,"JOAN: I'm doing my duty, just as much as you. Fine evening we've had"
313,together. 
314,DOCTOR: Not quite as planned. 
315,JOAN: Tell me about Nottingham. 
316,DOCTOR: Sorry? 
317,JOAN: That's where you were brought up. Tell me about it. 
318,"DOCTOR: Well, it lies on the River Leen, its southern boundary"
319,following the course of the River Trent which flows from Stoke to the
320,Humber. 
321,JOAN: That sounds like an encyclopaedia. Where did you live? 
322,DOCTOR: Broadmoor Street. Adjacent to Hotley Terrace in the district of
323,Radford Parade. 
324,"JOAN: But more that facts. When you were a child, where did you play?"
325,"All those secret little places, the dens and hideaways that only a"
326,"child knows? Tell me, John. Please tell me. "
327,"DOCTOR: How can you think that I'm not real? When I kissed you, was"
328,that a lie? 
329,"JOAN: No, it wasn't. No. "
330,"DOCTOR: But this Doctor sounds like some, some romantic lost prince."
331,Would you rather that? Am I not enough? 
332,"JOAN: No, that's not true. Never. "
333,DOCTOR: I've got to go. 
334,"JOAN: Martha was right about one thing, though. Those boys, they're"
335,"children. John Smith wouldn't want them to fight, never mind the"
336,"Doctor. The John Smith I was getting to know, he knows it's wrong,"
337,doesn't he? 
338,"ROCASTLE : Mister Smith, if you please! "
339,DOCTOR: What choice do I have? 
340,(He kisses her.)
341,
342,[Courtyard]
343,
344,"HUTCHINSON: Get those bags piled up, filth. Going"
345,to mean the difference between life and death for us. 
346,LATIMER: Not for you and me. 
347,HUTCHINSON: What are you babbling about?Â 
348,LATIMER: We're going to battle together. 
349,(Future memories of shells screaming overhead.) 
350,"LATIMER: We fight alongside. I've seen it. Not here, not now. "
351,HUTCHINSON: What's that supposed to mean? 
352,"LATIMER: It means you and I both survive this. And maybe, maybe I was"
353,given this watch so I could help. I'm sorry. 
354,(Latimer runs away.) 
355,"HUTCHINSON: Latimer, you filthy coward! "
356,"LATIMER: Oh yes, sir. Every time."
357,
358,[Farringham School]
359,
360,"(Martha gives a little scream, throws papers into"
361,"the air and leaves the Doctor's study. Latimer is hiding, talking to"
362,the watch.) 
363,LATIMER: What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? 
364,VOICES [watch]: Beware. 
365,LATIMER: Beware of what? 
366,VOICES [watch]: Her. 
367,"(Latimer looks up and sees Lucy standing in the corridor, holding her"
368,balloon. She sniffs.) 
369,LATIMER: Keep away. 
370,LUCY: Who are you? 
371,LATIMER: I saw you at the dance. You were with that family. You're one
372,of them. 
373,LUCY: What are you hiding? 
374,LATIMER: Nothing. 
375,LUCY: What have you got there? 
376,LATIMER: Nothing. 
377,"LUCY: Show me, little boy. "
378,"LATIMER: I reckon whatever you are, you're still in the shape of a"
379,"girl. How strong is she, do you think? Does she really want to see"
380,this? 
381,(Latimer aims the watch at Lucy and the golden energy shows her an
382,"explosion, and the Doctor. She runs away.) "
383,[Outside the school]
384,
385,BAINES: Time Lord. 
386,JENNY: Inside the device. 
387,BAINES: Everything he is concealed away in the hands of a schoolboy.
388,"But now we know, that's all we need to find. The boy and the watch."
389,What are we waiting for? Attack! 
390,(The army of scarecrows moves forward.)
391,
392,[Courtyard]
393,
394,ROCASTLE: Stand to! 
395,(The scarecrows hammer at the main gate.) 
396,ROCASTLE: At post! 
397,(Everyone takes aim.) 
398,"BOY: Enemy approaching, sir. "
399,ROCASTLE: Steady. Find the biting point. 
400,(The scarecrows break in.) 
401,ROCASTLE: Fire! 
402,(The boys open fire and take down scarecrows as they advance. The
403,Doctor does not squeeze his trigger. We are treated to another chorus
404,of To Be A Pilgrim as a contrast to the automatic gunfire. All the
405,scarecrows are down.) 
406,ROCASTLE: Cease fire! 
407,(He walks over to the scarecrows.) 
408,"ROCASTLE: They're straw. Like he said, straw. "
409,"HUTCHINSON: The no one's dead, sir? We killed no one? "
410,(Footsteps on the gravel.) 
411,ROCASTLE: Stand to! 
412,(It is Lucy and her balloon.) 
413,"ROCASTLE: You, child. Come out of the way. Come into the school. You"
414,"don't know who's out there. It's the Cartwright girl, isn't it? Come"
415,here. Come to me. 
416,(Martha runs out of the school.) 
417,"MARTHA: Mister Rocastle! Please, don't go near her. "
418,ROCASTLE: You were told to be quiet. 
419,"MARTHA: Just listen to me. She's part of it. Matron, tell him. "
420,"JOAN: I think that. I don't know. I think you should stay back,"
421,Headmaster. 
422,MARTHA: Mister Smith. 
423,"DOCTOR: She was, she was with, with Baines in the village. "
424,"ROCASTLE: Mister Smith, I've seen many strange sights this night, but"
425,there is no cause on God's Earth that would allow me to see this child
426,"in the field of battle, sir. Come with me. "
427,LUCY: You're funny. 
428,ROCASTLE: That's right. Now take my hand. 
429,LUCY: So funny. 
430,(Lucy produces a ray gun and vapourises the Headmaster.) 
431,"LUCY: Now who's going to shoot me. Any of you, really? "
432,DOCTOR: Put down your guns. 
433,"HUTCHINSON: But sir, the Headmaster. "
434,DOCTOR: I'll not see this happen. Not anymore. You will retreat in an
435,"orderly fashion back through the school. Hutchinson, lead the way. "
436,HUTCHINSON: But sir. 
437,"DOCTOR: I said, lead the way. "
438,"BAINES: Well, go on, then. Run! "
439,(Baines fires his gun into the air.) 
440,MARTHA: Come on! 
441,BAINES: Reanimate!
442,
443,[Stable block]
444,
445,"(The boys scatter through the buildings, followed"
446,by the reanimated scarecrows. Latimer runs upstairs.) 
447,DOCTOR: Let's go. Quick as you can. 
448,MARTHA: Don't go to the village. It's not safe. 
449,"DOCTOR: And you, ladies. "
450,JOAN: Not till we've got the boys out.
451,
452,[Farringham School]
453,
454,(The scarecrows have rounded up some boys.) 
455,JENNY: One of these boys has got the watch. This one? 
456,LUCY: No. 
457,BAINES: This one? 
458,LUCY: No. 
459,JENNY: This one? 
460,LUCY: No. 
461,HUTCHINSON: Get off me. I said get off me! 
462,"BAINES: Ah! This one, is that him? "
463,LUCY: (sniff) No. 
464,BAINES: Right. Then we can kill this lot. 
465,"(In the dormitory, Latimer opens the watch.) "
466,VOICE: Lord of Time. 
467,BAINES: That's it. 
468,JENNY: Upstairs! 
469,"HUTCHINSON: Don't just stand there. Outside. Come on, out!"
470,
471,[Stable block]
472,
473,"DOCTOR: Now, I insist. The pair of you, just go. If"
474,"there are any more boys inside, I'll find them. "
475,(He opens the door. There are scarecrows on the other side. He slams it
476,shut and locks it.) 
477,"DOCTOR: I think, retreat. "
478,[School grounds]

484,(He has the Tardis with him.) 
485,"CLARK: Come back, Doctor. Come home. Come and claim your prize. "
486,"BAINES: Out you come, Doctor. There's a good boy. Come to the Family. "
487,JENNY: Time to end it now. 
488,"MARTHA: You recognise it, don't you? "
489,"JENNY: Come out, Doctor. Come to us! "
490,DOCTOR: I've never seen it in my life. 
491,MARTHA: Do you remember its name? 
492,"JOAN: I'm sorry, John, but you wrote about it. The blue box. You dreamt"
493,of a blue box. 
494,"DOCTOR: I'm not. I'm John Smith. That's all I want to be. John Smith,"
495,"with his life, and his job, and his love. Why can't I be John Smith?"
496,Isn't he a good man? 
497,"JOAN: Yes. Yes, he is. "
498,DOCTOR: Why can't I stay? 
499,MARTHA: But we need the Doctor. 
500,"DOCTOR: What am I, then? Nothing. I'm just a story. "
501,(The Doctor runs away and the women follow.) 
502,"BAINES: One more phase and we won't have to hunt. The Doctor, Mister"

504,thing.

521,"JOAN: Oh, here we are. It should be empty. Oh, it's"
522,a long time since I've run that far.

527,
528,(It is dark inside. The table is laid for tea.) 
529,JOAN: Hello? No one home. We should be safe here. 
530,"MARTHA: Whose house is it, though? "
531,"JOAN: Er, the Cartwrights. That little girl at the school, she's Lucy"
532,"Cartwright, or she's taken Lucy Cartwright's form. If she came home"
533,"this afternoon and if the parents tried to stop their little girl, then"
534,they were vanished. 
535,(Joan touches the teapot.) 
536,JOAN: Stone cold. How easily I accept these ideas. 
537,"DOCTOR: I must go to them, before anyone else dies. "
538,"JOAN: You can't. Martha, there must be something we can do. "
539,MARTHA: Not without the watch. 
540,DOCTOR: You're this Doctor's companion. Can't you help? What exactly do
541,you do for him? Why does he need you? 
542,MARTHA: Because he's lonely. 
543,DOCTOR: And that's what you want me to become. 
544,(A knock at the door.) 
545,JOAN: What if it's them? 
546,"MARTHA: I'm not an expert, but I don't think scarecrows knock. "
547,(Martha opens the door.) 
548,LATIMER: I brought you this. 
549,(The watch.) 
550,MARTHA: Hold it. 
551,DOCTOR: I won't. 
552,"MARTHA: Please, just hold it. "
553,LATIMER: It told me to find you. It wants to be held. 
554,JOAN: You've had this watch all this time? Why didn't you return it? 
555,LATIMER: Because it was waiting. And because I was so scared of the
556,Doctor. 
557,JOAN: Why? 
558,LATIMER: Because I've seen him. He's like fire and ice and rage. He's
559,like the night and the storm in the heart of the sun. 
560,DOCTOR: Stop it. 
561,LATIMER: He's ancient and forever. He burns at the centre of time and
562,he can see the turn of the universe. 
563,DOCTOR: Stop it! I said stop it. 
564,LATIMER: And he's wonderful. 
565,JOAN: I've still got this. The journal. 
566,DOCTOR: Those are just stories. 
567,JOAN: Now we know that's not true. Perhaps there's something in here. 
568,(Big bang. The cottage shakes.)

580,DOCTOR: The watch. 
581,"JOAN: John, don't. "
582,VOICE: Closer. 
583,LATIMER: Can you hear it? 
584,VOICE: Closer. 
585,DOCTOR: I think he's asleep. Waiting to awaken. 
586,VOICE: Little man. 
587,LATIMER: Why did he speak to me? 
588,"DOCTOR: Oh, low level telepathic field. You were born with it. Just an"
589,extra synaptic engram causing. Is that how he talks? 
590,MARTHA: That's him. All you have to do is open it and he's back. 
591,DOCTOR: You knew this all along and yet you watched while Nurse Redfern
592,and I 
593,MARTHA: I didn't know how to stop you. He gave me a list of things to
594,"watch out, for but that wasn't included. "
595,(Joan looks in the journal by moonlight through the window.) 
596,DOCTOR: Falling in love? That didn't even occur to him? 
597,MARTHA: No. 
598,DOCTOR: Then what sort of man is that? And now you expect me to die? 
599,"MARTHA: It was always going to end, though! The Doctor said the"
600,"Family's got a limited lifespan, and that's why they need to consume a"
601,"Time Lord. Otherwise, three months and they die. Like mayflies, he"
602,said. 
603,DOCTOR: So your job was to execute me. 
604,MARTHA: People are dying out there. They need him and I need him.
605,Because you've got no idea of what he's like. I've only just met him.
606,It wasn't even that long ago. But he is everything. He's just
607,"everything to me and he doesn't even look at me, but I don't care,"
608,because I love him to bits. And I hope to God he won't remember me
609,saying this. 
610,(A explosion close by.) 
611,LATIMER: It's getting closer. 
612,DOCTOR: I should have thought of it before. I can give them this. Just
613,the watch. Then they can leave and I can stay as I am. 
614,MARTHA: You can't do that! 
615,"DOCTOR: If they want the Doctor, they can have him. "
616,MARTHA: He'll never let you do it. 
617,"DOCTOR: If they get what they want, then, then "
618,"JOAN: Then it all ends in destruction. I never read to the end, but"
619,"those creatures would live forever to breed and conquer, for war across"
620,"the stars for every child. Martha, Timothy, would you leave us alone,"
621,please? 
622,(Martha and Latimer leave. Joan hugs a sobbing Doctor. The bombardment
623,"on the village continues as Martha and Latimer sit outside, then she"
624,hugs him.) 
625,"JOAN: If I could do this instead of you, then I would. I'd hoped. But"
626,my hopes aren't important. 
627,DOCTOR: He won't love you. 
628,"JOAN: If he's not you, then I don't want him to. I had one husband, and"
629,"he died. I never thought, ever again. And then you were so "
630,DOCTOR: And it was real. I wasn't. I really thought. 
631,"JOAN: Let me see. Blasted thing. Blasted, blasted thing. Can't even"
632,hear it. It says nothing to me.

641,Everyone's safe?

661,"anything you want, just, just stop. "

663,DOCTOR: Please. 
664,(Jenny activates a control.) 
665,JENNY: Wait a minute. (sniff) Still human. 
666,"DOCTOR: Now I can't, I can't pretend to understand, not for a second,"
667,but I want you to know I'm innocent in all this. He made me John Smith.
668,It's not like I had any control over it. 
669,(He runs his hands over more switches.) 
670,JENNY: He didn't just make himself human. He made himself an idiot. 
671,"BAINES: Same thing, isn't it? "
672,DOCTOR: I don't care about this Doctor and your family. I just want you
673,"to go. So I've made my choice. You can have him. Just take it, please!"
674,Take him away. 
675,(The Doctor holds out the watch.) 
676,BAINES: At last. 
677,"(Baines takes the watch with one hand, and the Doctor's lapels by the"
678,other.) 
679,BAINES: Don't think that saved your life. 
680,(He pushes the Doctor away. More switches get activated as the Doctor
681,falls against the wall.) 
682,"BAINES: Family of Mine, now we shall have the lives of a Time Lord. "
683,(Baines opens the watch and they all sniff deeply.) 
684,BAINES: It's empty! 
685,DOCTOR: Where's it gone? 
686,BAINES: You tell me. 
687,"(Baines throws the watch to the Doctor, who catches it without"
688,looking.) 
689,"DOCTOR: Oh, I think the explanation might be you've been fooled by a"
690,simple olfactory misdirection. Little bit like ventriloquism of the
691,nose. It's an elementary trick in certain parts of the galaxy. But it
692,"has got to be said, I don't like the looks of that hydroconometer. It"
693,seems to be indicating you've got energy feedback all the way through
694,the retrostabilisers feeding back into the primary heat converters. Oh.
695,"Because if there's one thing you shouldn't have done, you shouldn't"
696,"have let me press all those buttons. But, in fairness, I will give you"
697,one word of advice. Run. 
698,(The Doctor runs out of the ship as alarms start to sound.)

701,[Coopers Field]
702,
703,"(The Family run, then their spaceship goes KaBOOM!)"
704,
705,BAINES : He never raised his voice. That was the worst thing. The
706,"fury of the Time Lord. And then we discovered why. Why this Doctor, who"
707,"had fought with gods and demons, why he'd run away from us and hidden."
708,He was being kind. 
709,"(Clark, wearing heavy chains, falls into a pit.) "
710,"BAINES : He wrapped my father in unbreakable chains, forged in the"
711,heart of a dwarf star. He tricked my mother into the event horizon of a
712,collapsing galaxy to be imprisoned there forever. 
713,(Jenny is sucked out of the Tardis in deep space.) 
714,BAINES : He still visits my little sister once a year every year. I
715,"wonder if one day he might forgive her, but there she is. Can you see?"
716,"He trapped her inside a mirror, every mirror. If ever you look at your"
717,"reflection and see something move behind you, just for a second, that's"
718,"her. That's always her. As for me, I was suspended in time. And the"
719,"Doctor put me to work standing over the fields of England, as their"
720,protector. 
721,(Baines has become a scarecrow.)

730,JOAN: The police and the army are at the school. The parents have come
731,to take the boys home. I should go. They'll have so many questions. I'm
732,"not sure what to say. Oh, you look the same. Goodness, you must forgive"
733,"my rudeness. I find it difficult to look at you. Doctor, I must call"
734,you Doctor. Where is he? John Smith? 
735,DOCTOR: He's in here somewhere. 
736,JOAN: Like a story. Could you change back? 
737,DOCTOR: Yes. 
738,JOAN: Will you? 
739,DOCTOR: No. 
740,"JOAN: I see. Well, then. He was braver than you in the end, that"
741,ordinary man. You chose to change. He chose to die. 
742,DOCTOR: Come with me. 
743,JOAN: I'm sorry? 
744,DOCTOR: Travel with me. 
745,JOAN: As what? 
746,DOCTOR: My companion. 
747,"JOAN: But that's not fair. What must I look like to you, Doctor? I must"
748,seem so very small. 
749,DOCTOR: No. We could start again. I'd like that. You and me. We could
750,"try, at least. Because everything that John Smith is and was, I'm"
751,"capable of that, too. "
752,JOAN: I can't. 
753,DOCTOR: Please come with me. 
754,JOAN: I can't. 
755,DOCTOR: Why not? 
756,"JOAN: John Smith is dead, and you look like him. "
757,"DOCTOR: But he's here, inside, if you look in my eyes. "
758,"JOAN: Answer me this. Just one question, that's all. If the Doctor had"
759,"never visited us, if he'd never chosen this place on a whim, would"
760,anybody here have died? (no answer) You can go.

785,DOCTOR: Tim Timothy Timber. 
786,LATIMER: I just wanted to say goodbye. And thank you. Because I've seen

788,biggest war ever. 
789,MARTHA: You don't have to fight. 
790,LATIMER: I think we do. 
791,MARTHA: But you could get hurt. 
792,"LATIMER: Well, so could you, travelling around with him, but it's not"
793,going to stop you. 
794,"DOCTOR: Tim, I'd be honoured if you'd take this. "
795,(The Doctor gives Latimer the fob watch.) 
796,LATIMER: I can't hear anything.
