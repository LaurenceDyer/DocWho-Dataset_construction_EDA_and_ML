23,"(In the Tyler's flat, Jackie is decorating the"
24,white plastic Christmas tree and putting presents under it. She looks
25,at the one for Rose and gazes wistfully into the distance. 
26,"Meanwhile, at Mickey's work, Noddy Holder is screaming 'Merry"
27,Christmas' on the radio when another sound can be faintly
28,heard above it and John's hammering.) 
29,"MICKEY: Hey, turn that down. Turn it off, Stevo. Turn that off! John,"
30,shut up! 
31,(It's a familiar whooshing sound. Mickey runs out.)
32,
33,[The Tyler's flat]
34,
35,(Jackie hears it too.) 
36,JACKIE: Rose! 
37,[Powell Estate]
38,
39,JACKIE: Mickey! 
40,"MICKEY: Jackie, it's the Tardis! "
41,"JACKIE: I know, I know, I heard it. She's alive, Mickey. I said so,"
42,didn't I? She's alive! 
43,MICKEY: Just shut up a minute. 
44,"JACKIE: Well, where is it then? "
45,(The Tardis comes out of the vortex in mid air and bounces off one
46,"block of flats, a second and a third before avoiding a post office van"
47,and finally crashing into a set of waste bins. The Doctor opens the
48,"door, still in t-shirt and leather jacket.) "
49,"DOCTOR: Here we are then, London. Earth. The Solar System. We did it."
50,"Jackie. Mickey. Blimey! No, no, no, no, hold on. Wait there. I've got"
51,"something to say. There was something I had to tell you, something"
52,"important. What was it? No, hold on, hold on. Hold on, shush, shush,"
53,"shush, shush. Oh, I know! Merry Christmas! "
54,(The Doctor collapses. Rose comes out of the Tardis.) 
55,ROSE: What happened? Is he all right? 
56,"MICKEY: I don't know, he just keeled over. But who is he? Where's the"
57,Doctor? 
58,"ROSE: That's him, right in front of you. That's the Doctor. "
59,"JACKIE: What do you mean, that's the Doctor? Doctor who? "
60,[The Tyler's flat - bedroom]
61,
62,(The Doctor has been dressed in pyjamas and put to
63,bed. Jackie comes in with a stethoscope.) 
64,"JACKIE: Here we go. Tina the cleaner's got this lodger, a medical"
65,"student, and she was fast asleep, so I just took it. Though I still say"
66,we should take him to hospital. 
67,ROSE: We can't. They'd lock him up. They'd dissect him. One bottle of
68,his blood could change the future of the human race. No! Shush! 
69,(Rose listens to both sides of the Doctor's chest.) 
70,ROSE: Both working. 
71,"JACKIE: What do you mean, both? "
72,"ROSE: Well, he's got two hearts. "
73,"JACKIE: Oh, don't be stupid. "
74,ROSE: He has. 
75,JACKIE: Anything else he's got two of? 
76,ROSE: Leave him alone. 
77,(Rose and Jackie leaves. The Doctor exhales some of the Tardis's golden
78,"energy, which flies off into space.)"
79,
80,[The Tyler's flat - kitchen]
81,
82,(Rose investigates the fridge.) 
83,JACKIE: How can he go changing his face? Is that a different face or is
84,he a different person? 
85,"ROSE: How should I know? Sorry. The thing is I thought I knew him, Mum."
86,I thought me and him were. And then he goes and does this. I keep
87,forgetting he's not human. The big question is where'd you get a pair
88,of men's pyjamas from? 
89,JACKIE: Howard's been staying over. 
90,"ROSE: What, Howard from the market? How long's that been going on? "
91,"JACKIE: A month or so. First of all, he starts delivering to the door"
92,"and I thought, that's a odd. Next thing you know, it's a bag of oranges"
93,
94,ROSE: Is that Harriet Jones? 
95,(Rose goes into the living room.) 
96,"JACKIE: Oh, never mind me. "
97,[The Tyler's flat]
98,
99,ROSE: Why's she on the telly? 
100,JACKIE: She's Prime Minister now. I'm eighteen quid a week better off.
101,They're calling it Britain's Golden Age. I keep on saying my Rose has
102,met her. 
103,ROSE: Did more than that. Stopped World War Three with her. Harriet
104,Jones. 
105,"MAN [on TV]: Prime Minister, what about those calling the Guinevere One"
106,Space Probe a waste of money? 
107,"HARRIET: [on TV]: Now, that's where you're wrong. I completely disagree"
108,if you don't mind. The Guinevere One Space Probe represents this
109,country's limitless ambition. British workmanship sailing up there
110,among the stars. 
111,"LLEWELLYN [on TV]: This is the spirit of Christmas, birth and"
112,"rejoicing, and the dawn of a new age, and that is what we're achieving"
113,fifteen million miles away. Our very own miracle. 
114,NARRATOR : The unmanned probe Guinevere One is about to make it's
115,final descent. Photographs of the Martian Landscape should be
116,received by midnight tonight. 
117,"(Out in space, the probe bumps into presumably either Phobos or Deimos."
118,A hatch opens in the Martian moon and the probe is sucked inside.)
119,
120,[Street]
121,
122,(A brass band dressed in Santa robes plays God Rest
123,"Ye Merry, Gentlemen.) "
124,MICKEY: So what do you need? Twenty quid? 
125,ROSE: Do you mind? I'll pay you back. 
126,MICKEY: Call it a Christmas present. 
127,"ROSE: God, I'm all out of synch. You just forget about Christmas and"
128,things in the Tardis. They don't exist. You get sort of timeless. 
129,"MICKEY: Oh, yeah, that's fascinating, because I love hearing stories"
130,"about the Tardis. Oh, go on Rose, tell us another one because I swear I"
131,"could listen to it all day. Tardis this, Tardis that. "
132,ROSE: Shut up. 
133,"MICKEY: Oh, and one time the Tardis landed in a big yellow garden full"
134,of balloons. 
135,ROSE: I'm not like that! 
136,"MICKEY: Oh, you so are. "
137,"ROSE: Mmm, must drive you mad. I'm surprised you don't give up on me. "
138,"MICKEY: Oh, that's the thing, isn't it? You can rely on me. I don't go"
139,changing my face. 
140,ROSE: Yeah. What if he's dying? 
141,MICKEY: Okay. 
142,ROSE: Sorry! 
143,MICKEY: Just let it be Christmas. Can you do that? Just for a bit. You
144,"and me and Christmas. No Doctor, no bog monsters, no life or death. "
145,ROSE: Okay. 
146,MICKEY: Promise? 
147,ROSE: Yes! 
148,MICKEY: Right! What're you going to get for your mum? 
149,(They walk around the market.) 
150,"MICKEY: I'm round there all the time now, you know. She does my dinner"
151,"on a Sunday, talks about you all afternoon, yap yap yap. "
152,"(The band, which is wearing plastic masks, starts to follow them. Rose"
153,"notices. They stop playing and one fires a flame out of his trombone,"
154,starting a panic. Mickey and Rose hide behind a stall. ) 
155,ROSE: It's us! They're after us! 
156,"(The tuba fires a blast which demolishes a large tree, sending it"
157,crashing onto him. Mickey and Rose flee.) 
158,MICKEY: What's going on? What've we done? Why are they after us? 
159,ROSE: Taxi! 
160,[Taxi]
161,
162,ROSE: They're after the Doctor. 
163,MICKEY: I can't even go shopping with you. We get attacked by a brass
164,band. Who're you phoning? 
165,ROSE: My mum.
166,
167,[The Tyler's flat]
168,
169,(But Jackie is already on the phone to a friend.) 
170,"JACKIE: She turns up, no warning. I've got nothing in. I said, Rose, if"
171,"you want a Christmas dinner of meat paste, then so be it."
172,
173,[Taxi]
174,
175,ROSE: Get off the phone! 
176,MICKEY: Who were those Santa things? 
177,ROSE: I don't know. But think about it. They were after us. What's
178,"important about us? Well, nothing, except the one thing we've got"
179,tucked up in bed. The Doctor. 
180,[The Tyler's flat - bedroom]
181,
182,"JACKIE: Oh, no. Don't come round, darling. No,"
183,"flat's all topsy turvy. Yeah, she just barges in and litters the place."
184,"Yeah. No, I'll come round and see you on Boxing day. "
185,(Jackie puts a mug of tea by the Doctor's bed and leaves. More golden
186,energy is exhaled.) 
187,[The Tyler's flat]
188,
189,(Rose and Mickey burst in.) 
190,"JACKIE: So, save us a chipolata. "
191,ROSE: Get off the phone. 
192,JACKIE: It's only Bev. She says hello. 
193,"ROSE: Bev? Yeah. Look, it'll have to wait. Right, it's not safe. We've"
194,got to get out. Where can we go? 
195,"MICKEY: My mate Stan, he'll put us up. "
196,ROSE: That's only two streets away. What about Mo? Where's she living
197,now? 
198,JACKIE: I don't know. Peak District. 
199,"ROSE: Well, we'll go to cousin Mo's then. "
200,"JACKIE: No, it's Christmas Eve! We're not going anywhere! What're you"
201,babbling about? 
202,ROSE: Mum. Where'd you get that tree? 
203,(The Christmas tree is now green.) 
204,ROSE: That's a new tree. Where'd you get it? 
205,JACKIE: I thought it was you. 
206,ROSE: How can it be me? 
207,"JACKIE: Well, you went shopping. There was a ring at the door, and"
208,there it was! 
209,"ROSE: No, that wasn't me. "
210,JACKIE: Then who was it ? 
211,(The tree lights up by itself and starts playing Jingle Bells.) 
212,"ROSE: Oh, you're kidding me. "
213,"(Sections of the tree start to rotate in different directions, creating"
214,"a strong wind. It starts to move, chopping through a coffee table.) "
215,"MICKEY: Get out! Go, go! Get out! "
216,(Mickey picks up a chair to fend it off as Jackie and Rose run for the
217,door.) 
218,ROSE: We've got to save the Doctor. 
219,JACKIE: What're you doing? 
220,ROSE: We can't just leave him. 
221,JACKIE: Mickey! 
222,(The spinning tree shreds the chair legs.) 
223,JACKIE: Leave it! Get out! Get out! 
224,ROSE: Mickey! 
225,JACKIE: Get out of there! 
226,[The Tyler's flat - bedroom]
227,
228,"JACKIE: No, leave him. Just leave him! "
229,MICKEY: Get in here! 
230,(Jackie does as the tree heads for them. She and Mickey pull a wardrobe
231,across the door.) 
232,"ROSE: Doctor, wake up! "
233,(Rose gets the sonic screwdriver from the jacket pocket and puts it in
234,the Doctor's hand. The tree smashes through the door.) 
235,JACKIE: I'm going to get killed by a Christmas tree! 
236,(Rose speaks into the Doctor's ear.) 
237,ROSE: Help me. 
238,"(He suddenly sits up, aims the screwdriver at the tree, and it"
239,explodes.) 
240,DOCTOR: Remote control. But who's controlling it? 
241,[Outside the flat]
242,
243,"(Dressing gown on, the Doctor leads the trio out."
244,"Down on the ground, three Santa's gaze up, one holding a radio"
245,controller.) 
246,MICKEY: That's them. What are they? 
247,ROSE: Shush! 
248,(The Doctor aims the screwdriver at them and the Santa's back away.
249,Then they are beamed away.) 
250,"MICKEY: They've just gone. What kind of rubbish were they? I mean, no"
251,"offence, but they're not much cop if a sonic screwdriver's"
252,going to scare them off. 
253,DOCTOR: Pilot fish. 
254,ROSE: What? 
255,DOCTOR: They were just pilot fish. 
256,(The Doctor is in pain.) 
257,ROSE: What's wrong? 
258,DOCTOR: You woke me up too soon. I'm still regenerating. I'm bursting
259,with energy. 
260,(He exhales the golden energy.)
261,DOCTOR: You see? The pilot fish could smell it a million miles away. So
262,"they eliminate the defence, that's you lot, and they carry me off. They"
263,could run their batteries on me for a couple of ow! 
264,JACKIE: Oh! Oh! Oh! 
265,DOCTOR: My head! I'm having a neuron implosion. I need 
266,JACKIE: What do you need? 
267,DOCTOR: I need 
268,"JACKIE: Say it. Tell me, tell me, tell me. "
269,DOCTOR: I need 
270,JACKIE: Painkillers? 
271,DOCTOR: I need 
272,JACKIE: Do you need aspirin? 
273,DOCTOR: I need 
274,"JACKIE: Codeine? Paracetamol? Oh, I don't know, Pepto-Bismol? "
275,DOCTOR: I need 
276,JACKIE: Liquid paraffin. Vitamin C? Vitamin D? Vitamin E? 
277,DOCTOR: I need 
278,JACKIE: Is it food? Something simple. Bowl of soup. A nice bowl of
279,soup? Soup and a sandwich? Soup and a little ham sandwich? 
280,DOCTOR: I need you to shut up. 
281,"JACKIE: Oh, he hasn't changed that much, has he? "
282,"DOCTOR: We haven't got much time. If there's pilot fish, then. Why's"
283,there an apple in my dressing gown? 
284,"JACKIE: Oh, that's Howard. Sorry. "
285,DOCTOR: He keeps apples in his dressing gown? 
286,JACKIE: He gets hungry. 
287,"DOCTOR: What, he gets hungry in his sleep? "
288,JACKIE: Sometimes. 
289,DOCTOR: Argh! Brain collapsing. The pilot fish. The pilot fish mean
290,"that something, something, something is coming."
291,(The Doctor passes out.)
292,
293,[The Tyler's flat]
294,
295,(Rose puts the suffering Doctor back to bed and
296,mops his brow. Mickey has fetched his laptop.) 
297,"MICKEY: Jackie, I'm using the phone line. Is that all right? "
298,JACKIE: Yeah. Keep a count of it. It's midnight. Christmas day. Any
299,change? 
300,ROSE: He's worse. Just one heart beating. 
301,REPORTER [on TV]: Scientists in charge of Britain's mission to Mars
302,have re-established contact with the Guinevere One space probe. They're
303,expecting the first transmission from the planet's surface in the next
304,few minutes. 
305,"LLEWELLYN [on TV]: Yes, we are. We're, we're back on schedule. We've"
306,received the signal from Guinevere One. The Mars landing would seem to
307,be an unqualified success. 
308,MAN : But is it true that you completely lost contact earlier
309,tonight? 
310,[Press conference]
311,
312,"LLEWELLYN: Yes, we had a bit of a scare. Guinevere"
313,"seemed to fall off the scope, but it, it was just a blip. Only"
314,disappeared for a few seconds. 
315,[The Tyler's flat]
316,
317,"LLEWELLYN [on TV]: She is fine now, absolutely"
318,fine. We're getting the first pictures transmitted live any minute now.
319,"I'd better get back to it, thanks. "
320,"MICKEY: Here we go, pilot fish. Scavengers, like the Doctor said."
321,"Harmless. They're tiny. But the point is, the little fish swim"
322,alongside the big fish. 
323,ROSE: Do you mean like sharks? 
324,"MICKEY: Great big sharks. So, what the Doctor means is, we had them,"
325,now we get that. 
326,ROSE: Something is coming. How close? 
327,"MICKEY: There's no way of telling, but the pilot fish don't swim far"
328,from their daddy. 
329,"ROSE: So, it's close? "
330,JACKIE: Funny sort of rocks. 
331,NEWSREADER [on TV]: The first photographs 
332,ROSE: That's not rocks 
333,NEWSREADER [on TV]: This image is being transmitted via mission
334,"control, coming live from the depths of space on Christmas morning. "
335,(It's an red-eyed ugly alien with a head like a goat's skull. It growls
336,and gurgles at the screen.) 
337,NEWSREADER: The face of an alien life form was transmitted live tonight
338,on BBC1. 
339,"NEWSREADER 2: (USA) On the 25th of December, the human race has been"
340,shown absolute proof that alien life exists. 
341,NEWSREADER 3: These remarkable images have been relayed right across
342,the world. 
343,[Tower of London]
344,
345,(A cortege of black cars drive past the White
346,Tower. Llewellyn is let out by a Secret Service officer and greeted by
347,a man in Army uniform with a troop of Red Berets.) 
348,"BLAKE: This way, sir. "
349,[UNIT HQ]
350,
351,(Basement level 11 is a hive of industry.)
352,BLAKE: Mister Llewellyn. 
353,(He is taken to a quieter room.)
354,"LLEWELLYN: Mister Llewellyn, ma'am. "
355,(Harriet flashes her ID.) 
356,HARRIET: Harriet Jones. Prime Minister. 
357,"LLEWELLYN: Oh. Well, yes, I know who you are. I suppose I've ruined"
358,your Christmas. 
359,"HARRIET: Never off duty. Now, we've put out a cover story. Alex has"
360,been handling it. 
361,ALEX: We've said it was a hoax. Some sort of mask or prosthetics.
362,"Students hi-jacking the signal, that sort of thing. "
363,HARRIET: Alex is my right hand man. I'm not used to having a right hand
364,"man. I quite like it, though. "
365,ALEX: I quite like it myself. 
366,LLEWELLYN: I don't suppose there's any chance it was a hoax? 
367,HARRIET: That would be nice. Then we could all go home. I don't suppose
368,anyone's offered you a coffee? 
369,LLEWELLYN: No. 
370,"HARRIET: But, no, the transmission was genuine. And this seems to be a"
371,"new species of alien. At least, not one we've encountered before. "
372,(Harriet gives him a cup of coffee.) 
373,LLEWELLYN: You seem to be talking about aliens as a matter of fact. 
374,HARRIET: There's an Act of Parliament banning my autobiography. 
375,BLAKE: Prime Minister? 
376,HARRIET: I'm with you. 
377,(They go out into the main area.) 
378,BLAKE: Miss Jacobs can explain. 
379,"HARRIET: I don't think we've been introduced. Harriet Jones, Prime"
380,Minister. 
381,"SALLY: Yes, I know who you are. The transmission didn't come from the"
382,surface of Mars. Guinevere One was broadcasting from a point five
383,thousand miles above the planet. 
384,"BLAKE: In other words, they've got a ship and the probe is on board. "
385,"LLEWELLYN: But if they're not from the surface, then they might not be"
386,from Mars itself. Maybe they're not actual Martians. 
387,BLAKE: Of course not. Martians look completely different. We think the
388,ship was in flight when they just came across the probe. 
389,SALLY: And they're moving. The ship's still in flight now. We've got it
390,on the Hubble array. 
391,HARRIET: Moving in which direction? 
392,SALLY: Towards us. 
393,HARRIET: How fast? 
394,SALLY: Very fast. 
395,"HARRIET: What was your name, again? "
396,SALLY: Sally. 
397,"HARRIET: Thank you, Sally. "
398,[The Tyler's flat]
399,
400,MICKEY: Rose. Take a look. I've got access to the
401,"military. They're tracking a spaceship. It's big, it's fast, and it's"
402,coming this way. 
403,"ROSE: Coming for what, though? The Doctor? "
404,MICKEY: I don't know. Maybe it's coming for all of us.
405,(Mickey gets a clear image of four of the aliens. UNIT has an even
406,bigger picture of more of them.) 
407,MICKEY: Have you seen them before? 
408,ROSE: No. 
409,[UNIT HQ]
410,
411,(The alien leader is speaking a softer version of
412,Klingon.) 
413,BLAKE: Translation software. 
414,"ALEX: Yes, sir. "
415,[The Tyler's flat]
416,
417,ROSE: I don't understand what they're saying. The
418,"Tardis translates alien languages inside my head, all the time,"
419,wherever I am. 
420,"MICKEY: So, why isn't it doing it now? "
421,"ROSE: I don't know. Must be the Doctor. Like he's part of the circuit,"
422,"and he's, he's broken. "
423,[UNIT HQ]
424,
425,"BLAKE: I'm getting demands from Washington, ma'am."
426,The President's insisting that he take control of the situation. 
427,"HARRIET: You can tell the President, and please use these exact words,"
428,"he's not my boss, and he's certainly not turning this into a war. "
429,(She goes to Alex.) 
430,HARRIET: What have we got? 
431,ALEX: Nothing yet. Translating an alien language is going to take time.
432,
433,BLAKE: How far off is the ship? 
434,ALEX: About five hours.
435,
436,[The Tyler's flat - bedroom]
437,
438,NEWS READER 2 [on TV]: Despite claims of an alien
439,"hoax, it's been reported that NATO forces are on red alert. "
440,"JACKIE: Oh, come on, sweetheart. What do you need? What is it you need?"
441,Tell me. 
442,"NEWSREADER [on TV]: Speaking strictly off the record, government"
443,sources are calling this our longest night. 
444,[UNIT HQ]
445,
446,HARRIET: I don't suppose we've had a Code Nine? No
447,sign of the Doctor? 
448,"BLAKE: Nothing yet. You've met him, haven't you? More like the stuff of"
449,legend. 
450,"HARRIET: He is that. Failing him, what about Torchwood? "
451,BLAKE: I 
452,"HARRIET: I know I'm not supposed to know about it, I realise that. Not"
453,even the United Nations knows. But if ever there was a need for
454,"Torchwood, it's now. "
455,BLAKE: I can't take responsibility. 
456,HARRIET: I can. See to it. Get them ready. 
457,ALEX: Prime Minister. 
458,HARRIET: Has it worked? 
459,ALEX: Just about. People. That could be cattle. You belong to us. To
460,"the Sycorax. They seem to be called Sycorax, not Martians. We own you."
461,"We now possess your land, your minerals, your precious stones. You will"
462,"surrender or they will die. Sycorax strong, Sycorax mighty, Sycorax"

842,all untested. Am I funny? Am I sarcastic? Sexy? Right old misery? Life
843,and soul? Right handed? Left handed? A gambler? A fighter? A coward? A
844,"traitor? A liar? A nervous wreck? I mean, judging by the evidence, I've"
845,"certainly got a gob. And how am I going to react when I see this, a"
846,great big threatening button. A great big threatening button which must
847,"not be pressed under any circumstances, am I right? Let me guess. It's"
848,"some sort of control matrix, hmm? Hold on, what's feeding it? "
849,(The Doctor opens the base of the pillar under the button.) 
850,"DOCTOR: And what've we got here? Blood? Yeah, definitely blood. Human"
851,"blood. A Positive, with just a dash of iron. Ah, but that means blood"
852,"control. Blood control! Oh, I haven't seen blood control for years."
853,You're controlling all the A Positives. Which leaves us with a great
854,big stinking problem. Because I really don't know who I am. I don't
855,know when to stop. So if I see a great big threatening button which
856,"should never, ever, ever be pressed, then I just want to do this. "

868,"DOCTOR: What do you think, big fellow? Are they dead? "
869,SYCORAX: We allow them to live. 
870,"DOCTOR: Allow? You've no choice. I mean, that's all blood control is. A"
871,"cheap bit of voodoo. Scares the pants off you, but that's as far as it"
872,goes. It's like hypnosis. You can hypnotise someone to walk like a
873,chicken or sing like Elvis. You can't hypnotise them to death. Survival
874,instinct's too strong. 
875,SYCORAX: Blood control was just one form of conquest. I can summon the
876,armada and take this world by force. 
877,"DOCTOR: Well, yeah, you could, yeah, you could do that, of course you"
878,could. But why? Look at these people. These human beings. Consider
879,their potential. From the day they arrive on the planet and blinking
880,"step into the sun, there is more to see than can ever be seen. More to"
881,"do than. No, hold on. Sorry, that's The Lion King. But the point still"

891,SYCORAX: You stand as this world's champion. 
892,"DOCTOR: Thank you. I've no idea who I am, but you just summed me up. "

915,DOCTOR: And now I know what sort of man I am. I'm lucky. Because quite
916,by chance I'm still within the first fifteen hours of my regeneration
917,"cycle, which means I've got just enough residual cellular energy to do"
918,this. 
919,(He grows a new hand.) 
920,SYCORAX: Witchcraft. 
921,DOCTOR: Time Lord. 
922,ROSE: Doctor! 
923,(Rose throws him another sword.) 
924,"DOCTOR: Oh, so I'm still the Doctor, then? "
925,ROSE: No arguments from me! 
926,DOCTOR: Want to know the best bit? This new hand? It's a fighting hand!
927,
928,(They fight again. The Doctor disarms the Sycorax and thumps both hilts
929,"into it's abdomen, twice. It falls, right on the edge, overlooking"
930,London.) 
931,DOCTOR: I win. 
932,SYCORAX: Then kill me. 
933,DOCTOR: I'll spare your life if you'll take this Champion's command.
934,"Leave this planet, and never return. What do you say? "
935,SYCORAX: Yes. 
936,DOCTOR: Swear on the blood of your species. 
937,SYCORAX: I swear. 
938,"DOCTOR: There we are, then. Thanks for that. Cheers, big fellow. "
939,HARRIET: Bravo! 
940,ROSE: That says it all. Bravo! 
941,"DOCTOR: Ah, not bad for a man in his jim-jams. "
942,(Rose helps him on with the dressing gown.) 
943,"DOCTOR: Very Arthur Dent. Now, there was a nice man. Hold on, what have"
944,"I got in here? A satsuma. Ah, that friend of your mothers. He does like"
945,his snacks doesn't he? But doesn't that just sum up Christmas? You go
946,"through all those presents and right at the end, tucked away at the"
947,"bottom, there's always one stupid old satsuma. Who wants a satsuma? "
948,"(The Sycorax leader gets up, grabs his sword and runs at the Doctor's"
949,back. The Doctor throws the satsuma at a control on the
950,"spaceship hull, a piece of the wing opens up and the leader falls to"
951,his death.) 
952,DOCTOR: No second chances. I'm that sort of a man.
953,
954,[Spaceship]
955,
956,"DOCTOR: By the ancient rites of combat, I forbid"
957,you to scavenge here for the rest of time. And when go you back to the
958,"stars and tell others of this planet, when you tell them of it's"
959,"riches, it's people, it's potential. When you talk of the Earth, then"
960,make sure that you tell them this. It is defended. 
961,"(The Tardis, Harriet, Alex, Rose, Mickey and the Doctor are beamed"
962,away.)
963,
964,[Road]
965,
966,ROSE: Where are we? 
967,"MICKEY: We're just off Bloxom Road. We're just round the corner, we did"
968,it! 
969,"DOCTOR: Wait a minute, wait a minute. "
970,(The spaceship flies away.) 
971,"MICKEY: Go on, my son! Oh, yeah! "
972,ROSE: Yeah! Don't come back! 
973,MICKEY: It is defended! 
974,"(Rose and Mickey hug, then Rose hugs Alex.) "
975,HARRIET: My Doctor. 
976,DOCTOR: Prime Minister. 
977,(They hug.) 
978,HARRIET: Absolutely the same man. Are there many more out there? 
979,"DOCTOR: Oh, not just Sycorax. Hundreds of species. Thousands of them."
980,And the human race is drawing attention to itself. Every day you're
981,sending out probes and messages and signals. This planet's so noisy.
982,You're getting noticed more and more. You'd better get used to it. 
983,JACKIE: Rose! 
984,ROSE: Mum! 
985,"DOCTOR: Oh, talking of trouble. "
986,"JACKIE: Oh, my God! You did it, Rose! Oh! "
987,(Alex answers a phone call.) 
988,ROSE: You did it too! It was the tea. Fixed his head. 
989,"DOCTOR: That was all I needed, cup of tea. "
990,JACKIE: I said so. 
991,ROSE: Look at him. 
992,"JACKIE: Is it him, though? Is it really the Doctor? Oh, my God, it's"
993,the bleeding Prime Minister! 
994,"DOCTOR: Come here, you. "
995,(Group hug.) 
996,JACKIE: Are you better? 
997,"DOCTOR: I am, yeah. "
998,ALEX: It's a message from Torchwood. They say they're ready. 
999,JACKIE: You left me. 
1000,ROSE: I'm sorry. 
1001,JACKIE: I had all the food. 
1002,HARRIET: Tell them to fire. 
1003,ALEX: Fire at will. 
1004,"(Five green beams streak up into the sky, meet and fire out into space."
1005,The Sycorax asteroid ship goes KaBOOM!) 
1006,ROSE: What is that? What's happening? 
1007,DOCTOR: That was murder. 
1008,HARRIET: That was defence. It's adapted from alien technology. A ship
1009,that fell to Earth ten years ago. 
1010,DOCTOR: But they were leaving. 
1011,"HARRIET: You said yourself, Doctor, they'd go back to the stars and"
1012,"tell others about the Earth. I'm sorry, Doctor, but you're not here all"
1013,the time. You come and go. It happened today. Mister Llewellyn and the
1014,"Major, they were murdered. They died right in front of me while you"
1015,were sleeping. In which case we have to defend ourselves. 
1016,DOCTOR: Britain's Golden Age. 
1017,HARRIET: It comes with a price. 
1018,DOCTOR: I gave them the wrong warning. I should've told them to run as
1019,"fast as they can, run and hide because the monsters are coming. The"
1020,human race. 
1021,HARRIET: Those are the people I represent. I did it on their behalf. 
1022,DOCTOR: Then I should have stopped you. 
1023,"HARRIET: What does that make you, Doctor? Another alien threat? "
1024,"DOCTOR: Don't challenge me, Harriet Jones, because I'm a completely new"
1025,man. I could bring down your Government with a single word. 
1026,"HARRIET: You're the most remarkable man I've ever met, but I don't"
1027,think you're quite capable of that. 
1028,"DOCTOR: No, you're right. Not a single word, just six. "
1029,HARRIET: I don't think so. 
1030,DOCTOR: Six words. 
1031,HARRIET: Stop it! 
1032,DOCTOR: Six. 
1033,(The Doctor goes over to Alex and whispers in his ear.) 
1034,DOCTOR: Don't you think she looks tired? 
1035,"(The Doctor, Rose, Mickey and Jackie leave.) "
1036,HARRIET: What did he say? 
1037,"ALEX: Oh, well, nothing, really. "
1038,HARRIET: What did he say? 
1039,ALEX: Nothing. I don't know. 
1040,"HARRIET: Doctor! Doctor, what did you? What was that? What did he say?"
1041,"What did you say, Doctor? Doctor! I'm sorry. "
1042,[The Tyler's flat]
1043,
1044,(The Doctor is picking himself a new outfit in the
1045,"Tardis wardrobe, and considers David's Casanova costume. We hear the"
1046,specially written Song For Ten by Murray Gold sung by Tim Phillips.) 
1047,"SINGER: When I woke up today and the world seemed a restless place, it"
1048,could have been that way for me. 
1049,"(Mickey, Rose and Jackie are back at the flat having Christmas dinner."
1050,Mickey carves the turkey.) 
1051,SINGER: Then I wandered around and I thought of your face that
1052,Christmas looking back at me. 
1053,(The Doctor finds a brown pinstripe suit and long brown coat. He leaves
1054,the wardrobe past the old
1055,hat stand with a long scarf on it.) 
1056,SINGER: I wish today was just like every other day. Cause today has
1057,been the best day. 
1058,(The Doctor is back to a nice suit and tie after his recent
1059,aberration.) 
1060,"SINGER: Everything I ever dreamed. Then I started to walk, pretty soon"
1061,I will run. And I'll be running back to you. Because I followed my
1062,"star, and that's what you are. I've had a merry time with you. "
1063,(The Doctor enters. The dinner progresses to the crackers.) 
1064,SINGER: I wish today was just like every other day. 
1065,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's yours. "
1066,"ROSE: It's pink! Mum, it should be yours. Look, it's Harriet Jones. "
1067,"(That television is never switched off BBC24, it seems.) "
1068,"MAN [on TV]: Prime Minister, is it true you are no longer fit to be in"
1069,position? 
1070,"HARRIET [on TV]: No. Now, can we talk about other things? "
1071,MAN [on TV]: Is it true you're unfit for office? 
1072,(The Doctor puts on a pair of spectacles to watch the interview.) 
1073,"HARRIET [on TV]: Look, there is nothing wrong with my health. I don't"
1074,know where these stories are coming from. And a vote of no confidence
1075,is completely unjustified. 
1076,MAN [on TV]: Are you going to resign? 
1077,(The telephone rings.) 
1078,"HARRIET [on TV]: On today of all days, I'm fine. Look at me, I'm fine."
1079,"I look fine, I feel fine. "
1080,JACKIE: It's Beth. She says go and look outside. 
1081,ROSE: Why? 
1082,"JACKIE: I don't know, just go outside and look. Come on, shift! "
1083,[Powell Estate]
1084,
1085,(The ground is covered with white flakes falling
1086,from the sky. Streaks of light
1087,cris-cross the sky.) 
1088,"ROSE: Oh, it's beautiful. What are they, meteors? "
1089,DOCTOR: It's the spaceship breaking up in the atmosphere. This isn't
1090,"snow, it's ash. "
1091,"ROSE: Okay, not so beautiful. "
1092,DOCTOR: This is a brand new planet Earth. No denying the existence of
1093,aliens now. Everyone saw it. Everything's new. 
1094,ROSE: And what about you? What are you going to do next? 
1095,"DOCTOR: Well, back to the Tardis. Same old life. "
1096,ROSE: On your own? 
1097,"DOCTOR: Why, don't you want to come? "
1098,"ROSE: Well, yeah. "
1099,"DOCTOR: Do you, though? "
1100,ROSE: Yeah! 
1101,"DOCTOR: I just thought, because I changed. "
1102,"ROSE: Yeah, I thought, because you changed you might not want me"
1103,anymore. 
1104,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'd love you to come, "
1105,ROSE: Okay. 
1106,"MICKEY: You're never going to stay, are you? "
1107,ROSE: There's just so much out there. So much to see. I've got to. 
1108,MICKEY: Yeah. 
1109,"JACKIE: Well, I reckon you're mad, the pair of you. It's like you go"
1110,looking for trouble. 
1111,"DOCTOR: Trouble's just the bits in-between. It's all waiting out there,"
1112,"Jackie, and it's brand new to me. All those planets, and creatures and"
1113,horizons. I haven't seem them yet! Not with these eyes. And it is going
1114,to be fantastic. 
1115,ROSE: That hand of yours still gives me the creeps. 
1116,(She takes hold of it anyway.)
1117,"ROSE: So, where're we going to go first? "
1118,"DOCTOR: Er, that way. No, hold on. That way. "
1119,(He points up.) 
1120,ROSE: That way? 
1121,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
1122,"ROSE: Yeah, that way."
