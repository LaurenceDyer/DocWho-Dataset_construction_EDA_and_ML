17, [Frost Fair]
18,
19,"  (Carrying straight on from last week. Strictly speaking the elephant should put us at Blackfriars, but the dome "
20,  of St Pauls' Cathedral is too close for that.) 
21,  MAN: Come on. Come on this way. Come and see the elephant. 
22,
23,BILL: Okay. I have questions. 
24,
25,[Tardis]
26,
27,
28,BILL: You never said we could travel
29,to parallel worlds! 
30,
31,DOCTOR: Not a parallel world. 
32,BILL: But that's London. 
33,
34,(The map is on the scanner.) 
35,DOCTOR: Our London.
36,
37,We're on the Thames. The last great
38,"Frost Fair. 1814, February the fourth. "
39,
40,"BILL: Hang on, why aren't we home?"
41,Can't you steer this thing? 
42,
43,DOCTOR: I told you. You don't steer
44,"the Tardis, you reason with it. "
45,
46,BILL: How?  
47,"DOCTOR: Unsuccessfully,"
48,most of the time. 
49,(He sets the Tardis in motion.) 
50,"DOCTOR: She's a bad girl, this one. "
51,
52,Always looking for trouble. 
53,
54,[Next to the river]
55,
56,"(The Tardis has materialised safely above the river, either on Southwark or Blackfriars Bridge, or a wharfside.)"
57,BILL: Whoa. 
58,
59,DOCTOR: Last day before the thaw.
60,
61,Thought I'd better find
62,a more reliable parking spot. 
63,
64,"BILL: Wait, you want to go out there? "
65,
66,DOCTOR: You don't? 
67,BILL: It's 1814. 
68,(Bill points to her face.) 
69,BILL: Melanin. 
70,DOCTOR: Yes? 
71,BILL: Slavery is still totally a thing. 
72,
73,"DOCTOR: Yes, so it is. "
74,
75,"BILL: It might be, like, dangerous"
76,out there. 
77,DOCTOR: Definitely dangerous.  
78,
79,"BILL: So, how do we stay out of trouble? "
80,
81,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm not the right person"
82,to ask. 
83,
84,"BILL: Okay, when you go somewhere"
85,"dangerous, what do you take? "
86,
87,"DOCTOR: First door on the left,"
88,"second right, under the stairs,"
89,
90,"past the bins, fifth door"
91,on the left.  
92,BILL: What's there? 
93,
94,DOCTOR: The wardrobe. Pick a dress. 
95,
96,BILL: So the Tardis has dresses
97,and likes a bit of trouble?
98,
99,"Yeah, I think I'm low-key"
100,in love with her.  
101,DOCTOR: Me too. 
102,(Bill goes inside the Tardis. A vendor with a basket of vegetables on his shoulder nearly collides with the Doctor.)
103,"GROCER: Watch out, sir! "
104,(He slips and turns on the icy stones and his basket falls onto the ice.) 
105,GROCER: Oh. 
106," (Below the ice, a boot is dislodged and falls down until it impact with something very big, "
107,"which opens an eye and sucks the boot in between its massive, sharp teeth.)"
108,(A short time later. We are lead to believe that the Tardis is by New 
109,Lime Wharf. The Doctor has chosen to wear a top hat and black frock 
110,"coat, while Bill is in a very suitable"
111,fur-trimmed ensemble and hat with a large feather.)
112,
113,BILL: Doesn't anyone notice the Tardis? 
114,
115,DOCTOR: Your species hardly
116,notices anything. 
117,
118,"(Inside the Tardis, the scanner lights up most of the Thames from beyond"
119," the Isle of Dogs to past the Houses of Parliament in red, and reports "
120,Warning: Life form detected.)
121,"BILL: So, what are the rules? "
122,
123,DOCTOR: Rules?  
124,BILL: Yeah.
125,
126,"Travelling to the past,"
127,There's got to be rules.
128,
129,"If I step on a butterfly,"
130,it could send ripples through time
131,
132,that mean I'm not even born
133,in the first place
134,
135,and I could just disappear. 
136,(Some wag has put a This Way to Freezeland Street sign on the corner.) 
137,"DOCTOR: Definitely. I mean, "
138,
139,that's what happened to Pete. 
140,BILL: Pete?  
141,"DOCTOR: Your friend, Pete."
142,
143,"He was standing there a moment ago,"
144,
145,but he stepped on a butterfly and
146,now you don't even remember him. 
147,
148,BILL: Shut up!
149,
150,I'm being serious! 
151,"DOCTOR: Yeah, so was Pete. "
152,
153,BILL: You know what I mean.
154,
155,"Every choice I make in this moment,"
156,
157,"here and now, could change"
158,the whole future. 
159,
160,DOCTOR: Exactly like every other day
161,of your life.
162,
163,The only thing to do
164,is to stop worrying about it. 
165,
166,BILL: Hmm. Okay. If you say so. 
167,
168,DOCTOR: Pete's stopped worrying. 
169,"NUT SELLER: Chestnuts, sir? "
170,
171,"DOTTIE:(a very little girl) Come to the Frost Fair, miss."
172,"Only a sixpence, miss. "
173,
174,"BILL: Oh, my God "
175,
176,"DOCTOR: You're not stepping on a butterfly,"
177,you're just taking a flyer. 
178,"(Bill takes the flyer, and the Doctor gives the urchin girl the hot chestnuts, then puts his top hat on her head.) "
179,DOCTOR: It's just time travel.
180,
181,Don't overthink it.  
182,BILL: Is that what
183,you said to Pete?  
184,DOCTOR: Who's Pete? 
185,(They head down the steps to the river.)
186,WATERMAN: Sixpence to the waterman!
187,
188,Sixpence for the Frost Fair! 
189,(Pete. Waterman. Groan. Historical note - the watermen kept law and 
190,"order on the river, this being before the creation of a police force. "
191,"The Doctor pays the sixpence, Bill hands him the flyer then picks up her"
192, skirt with both hands and steps gingerly onto the snow-covered ice.) 
193,WATERMAN: Sixpence to the waterman! 
194,Sixpence for the Frost Fair! 
195,"BILL: Yeah, no big deal."
196,
197,Just walking on the Thames!
198,
199,I hope you realise
200,I'm going to try everything.
201,
202,Everything. 
203,
204,"WOMAN: Tasty ox cheek, piping hot! "
205,
206,"MAN: Lapland mutton! Lapland mutton,"
207,cooked right on the ice! 
208,
209,WOMAN 2: Get your sheep hearts here!
210,"Juicy, juicy sheep hearts! "
211,
212,BILL: Yeah. Maybe not everything. 
213,
214,"DOCTOR: Oh, go on. Try this, at least. "
215,BILL: Urgh!  
216,DOCTOR: It's my favourite. 
217,"(A curled piece of animal anatomy on a skewer. Blackadder the Third Nob and Nobility, anyone?) "
218,BILL: Your favourite?
219,You've been here before? 
220,
221,"DOCTOR: Oh, yeah. A few times. "
222,(A crowd makes appreciative noises as they watch a sword-swallower do 
223,"his act, then wrestle with another man in 'Turkish' costume.) "
224,
225,BILL: Get in! 
226,
227,"DOCTOR: Of course, it's not really wrestling"
228,unless it's in zero gravity 
229,
230,BILL: Seriously?  
231,DOCTOR: With tentacles 
232,
233,BILL: Okay. 
234,DOCTOR: And magic spells. 
235,"(They move on. Bill realises just how ethnically diverse London has always been, given its status as a world trading port.)"
236,BILL: Interesting.  
237,DOCTOR: What is? 
238,
239,BILL: Regency England.
240,
241,Bit more black than they show
242,in the movies. 
243,
244,DOCTOR: So was Jesus.
245,
246,History's a whitewash. 
247,(The thing in the river has its eye on the two wrestlers making the 
248,thuds reverberate through the water. Two green fluorescent lights head 
249,up towards them.) 
250,
251,[Skittles tent]
252,
253,(The skittles fall from a single ball.) 
254,"BILL: Pub champion, two years running. "
255,DOCTOR: Ah.
256,(Bill notices the green lights. The Doctor has got another top hat from somewhere.)
257,
258,[Fish pie tent]
259,
260,PIE-MAN: Best fish pies on the ice. 
261,
262,"Try your luck, ladies and gentlemen!"
263,Toss for a pie! 
264,(The result of the toss is clearly not what Bill called.)
265,BILL: Argh! 
266,"PIE-MAN: Better luck next time, miss. "
267,
268,BILL: And you're sure this isn't
269,cow brains or sheep eyes or 
270,(He hands her the pie she has bought.)
271,
272,"PIE-MAN: I caught the fish myself, miss."
273,
274,Made it right here in the old...
275,(He spins round to catch the Doctor at something.)
276,PIE-MAN: Hey!
277,
278,What are you about? 
279,DOCTOR: Do that again. Toss the coin. 
280,
281,PIE-MAN: Pay me another and I will.  
282,(The Doctor hands over a coin. Bill is enjoying eating her pie.)
283,DOCTOR: Forget
284,"about the pie, I don't want a pie."
285,
286,I just want to see how you cheated. 
287,PIE-MAN: Cheated?! 
288,(The green lights are back.)
289,BILL: Doctor. 
290,
291,DOCTOR: Don't look at me like that. I'm
292,saying you're a very good con-man. 
293,
294,PIE-MAN: I'm a what? 
295,DOCTOR: A trickster. A swindler.
296,
297,"You see, I'm a bit of a thief"
298,myself.
299,
300,I bet you that I could steal
301,anything from your shop. 
302,(Bill follows the lights outside.)
303,
304,[Frost Fair]
305,
306,PIE-MAN : Get out! 
307,"(The Doctor is forcibly ejected, and slides into one of the lady acrobats.) "
308,DOCTOR: Oh! 
309,
310,In theory!
311,
312,I could steal anything in theory! 
313,
314,BILL: Doctor. 
315,"DOCTOR:  Honestly, some people. More pie? "
316,(He has stolen another one?) 
317,BILL: Are there side-effects to time
318,"travel? Like, physical symptoms? "
319,
320,"DOCTOR: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah."
321,
322,Sometimes you see lights
323,under the ice. 
324,(She disposes of the remains of her pie.) 
325,"BILL: Okay, so you've seen the lights. "
326,
327,DOCTOR: Of course. 
328,"BILL: Well, why didn't you say something? "
329,
330,"DOCTOR: Well, you're enjoying yourself."
331,
332,I assumed we'd get to work
333,eventually. 
334,"(We follow a couple skating away from the fair, then focus on a drunk as"
335, he stumbles past a sign saying Danger Thin Ice! He is following 
336,"a green light, with more coming up behind him. Then we hear a splosh, a "
337,"cry, and see green lights circling a bottle spinning on the ice.) "
338,
339,"DOCTOR: Now, are these lights"
340,electric or organic? 
341,
342,BILL: Organic lights? 
343,
344,DOCTOR: Bioluminescence.
345,
346,"Fireflies, glow-worms. "
347,"(A dark girl wrapped in a large shawl approaches them, holding up a dog collar and lead.) "
348,"KITTY: Please, sir. Have you seen my dog?"
349,
350,"He was right here,"
351,but then I looked away and he 
352,
353,"BILL: It's okay, we'll help."
354,
355,"Um, what does he look like? "
356,
357,KITTY: He's small and brown
358,and ever so soft. 
359,
360,DOCTOR: Are you sure of that?
361,
362,That collar's for a big dog.
363,With long white hair.
364,
365,"Nice con, though."
366,
367,Respect. 
368,(A little boy with a red hat has been sneaking up behind them. He grabs 
369,"the Doctor's sonic screwdriver, but the Doctor grabs his wrist and they "
370,struggle until 
371,Kitty kicks the Doctor in the shins.) 
372,KITTY: Run! 
373,DOCTOR: Ah! 
374,(The soldiers don't bother to help as the Doctor and Bill give chase. 
375,They are held up by the troupe of acrobats and the urchins reach the 
376,safety of their tent.)
377,
378,[Urchin's hideout]
379,
380,"SPIDER: (the boy in the red hat) What is it, do you think? "
381,KITTY: Something valuable.
382,
383,Don't break it. 
384,
385,[Frost Fair]
386,
387,DOCTOR: What happened to the girl? 
388,BILL: Does it matter?
389,
390,The boy's the one with your magic
391,wand.  
392,DOCTOR: Sonic screwdriver. 
393,
394,BILL: How is that a screwdriver? 
395,DOCTOR: In a very broad sense. 
396,
397,"BILL: All right, how's it sonic? "
398,DOCTOR: It makes a noise. 
399,(He sees Kitty and the boy come out of the tent.) 
400,DOCTOR: There they are! 
401,"(Another chase across the ice, with the green light angler fish following them. The boy stops to look at the lights.) "
402,"KITTY: Spider, come on! "
403,
404,"SPIDER: Kitty, come look! "
405,(The green lights are circling him.)
406,KITTY: They'll catch you
407,and have you transported!
408,
409,Is that what you want? 
410,Spider!
411,
412,"Spider, quick! "
413,(The Doctor and Bill can see them.) 
414,DOCTOR: The lights. He's seen the lights. 
415,"(As they run forward, the ice below Spider creaks.) "
416,SPIDER: Kitty? Ah! 
417,(Spider falls through the ice. Only his arm holding the sonic screwdriver aloft like the Lady of the Lake is visible.) 
418,DOCTOR: 
419,Stay back! 
420,(The green lights whirl around Spider and his arm slowly sinks. The 
421,"Doctor edges forward and makes a snatch for him, but just ends up with "
422,the screwdriver. 
423,The hole in the ice seals itself. The green lights have gone.) 
424,BILL: Save him. 
425,
426,DOCTOR: I can't. He's gone. 
427,
428,BILL: Do something
429,
430,and save him. 
431,
432,"DOCTOR: I'm sorry about your friend,"
433,
434,but the danger isn't over yet.
435,
436,There must be more of you living
437,rough here. Tell me where. 
438,
439,"KITTY: So, you can take us to"
440,the Magistrate?  
441,"DOCTOR: No, of course not."
442,
443,"We're not here to arrest you,"
444,we're here to help.
445,
446,"And if you show me where you live,"
447,we can do that. 
448,
449,KITTY: We? 
450,She's gone! 
451,"(The Doctor looks around for Bill, and Kitty runs off into the mist.)"
452,
453,[River's edge]
454,
455,(Bill is crying.) 
456,BILL: How did you find me? 
457,
458,DOCTOR: Get used to that question. 
459,
460,"BILL: Oh, clever."
461,"Yeah, very clever. "
462,
463,DOCTOR: What's wrong? 
464,
465,BILL: What's wrong?
466,
467,"Seriously, what's wrong?"
468,
469,I've never seen anyone die before. 
470,
471,"DOCTOR: A few hours ago, we were standing"
472,in a garden full of dead people. 
473,
474,BILL: That was different.  
475,DOCTOR: How? 
476,
477,BILL: They were dead already. 
478,
479,"DOCTOR: Morally and practically,"
480,
481,that is not a useful distinction. Unlearn it. 
482,
483,BILL: Don't tell me what to think. 
484,
485,DOCTOR: I'm your teacher. 
486,
487,Telling you things is what I do. 
488,
489,BILL: Yeah? Tell me this.
490,
491,"You've seen people die before, yeah? "
492,DOCTOR: Of course.  
493,BILL: You still care? 
494,
495,DOCTOR: Of course I care. 
496,
497,BILL: How many?  
498,DOCTOR: How many what? 
499,
500,"BILL: If you care so much,"
501,
502,tell me how many people
503,you've seen die? 
504,
505,DOCTOR: I don't know. 
506,
507,BILL: Okay.
508,
509,How many before you lost count? 
510,
511,"DOCTOR: I care, Bill, but I move on. "
512,
513,BILL: Yeah? How quickly? 
514,
515,DOCTOR: It's not me you're angry with. 
516,
517,BILL: Have you ever killed anyone?
518,
519,There's a look in your eyes
520,sometimes that makes me wonder.
521,
522,Have you? 
523,
524,DOCTOR: There are situations when
525,the options available are limited. 
526,
527,BILL: Not what I asked. 
528,
529,DOCTOR: Sometimes the choices are very 
530,BILL: That's not what I asked! 
531,
532,DOCTOR: Yes. 
533,
534,BILL: How many? 
535,(No reply.) 
536,BILL: Don't tell me.
537,
538,You've moved on. 
539,
540,DOCTOR: You know what happens if I don't
541,move on? More people die.
542,
543,There are kids
544,living rough near here. 
545,
546,They may well be next on the menu.
547,
548,Do you want to help me? Do you want
549,to stand here stamping your foot?
550,
551,Because let me tell you something. 
552,"I'm two thousand years old, "
553,
554,and I have never had the time
555,
556,for the luxury of outrage. 
557,(Bill looks at Kitty standing behind him. The Doctor turns around.) 
558,"KITTY: What do you mean, on the menu? "
559,
560,[Urchin's hideout]
561,
562,BILL: Is this where you live? 
563,KITTY: For now. 
564,
565,BILL: But there's no one here. 
566,KITTY: Good work! 
567,(The Urchins come out of their hiding places.)
568,"KITTY: Except you, Dot."
569,I can see your shoes. 
570,
571,"DOTTIE: They're too big, that's why! "
572,(She is wearing the Doctor's original top hat.) 
573,"DOCTOR: Oh, I see! I get it."
574,
575,You lure people to the fair
576,and then you rob them.
577,
578,Very good. Very enterprising. 
579,(Dot hides her face in Kitty's shawl.) 
580,"KITTY: They're all right, Dot."
581,
582,Strange. But all right.
583,
584,And that's not how it is. 
585,
586,"DOCTOR: Oh, what? You don't rob people? "
587,
588,KITTY: Course we do.
589,
590,"But bringing people to the fair, "
591,that's by-the-by.
592,
593,"On the side, like. "
594,
595,DOCTOR: Why?  
596,KITTY: Why?
597,
598,"For coin, of course. Why else? "
599,
600,DOCTOR: Someone pays you
601,"to promote the fair, get people onto the ice? "
602,(Kitty nods.) 
603,DOCTOR: Who? Who pays you? 
604,
605,"HARRIET: (in boy's clothing) Kitty, where's Spider? "
606,
607,KITTY: Spider is.
608,
609,He... 
610,
611,DOCTOR: Who's hungry? I'm hungry.
612,
613,"Food! Bill, food!"
614,
615,Food is always useful. 
616,(They hand out fish pies.)
617,
618,"DOCTOR: Now, I know what you're thinking,"
619,
620,but don't worry.
621,
622,These are stolen!
623,
624,"Well, eat up."
625,
626,"Ah, with your permission, of course. "
627,"(Kitty nods, and the urchins bite into the pastries.) "
628,"(Later, by a fire, reading the story of Little Suck-A-Thumb from Der "
629,"Struwwelpeter by Heinrich Hoffmann, which is anachronistic as it was "
630,written in German in 1845.) 
631,DOCTOR: Don't suck your thumbs
632,while I'm away.
633,
634,The great tall tailor
635,always comes
636,
637,To little boys

650,BILL: We're going to find out

652,
653,They're not going to hurt

656,I promise.

665,"What do you do,"
666,apart from shout at him? 
667,
668,BILL: We were fighting.
669,
670,It happens. 
671,
672,KITTY: Are you still fighting now? 
673,
674,BILL: No.
675,
676,I moved on. 
677,
678,"DOCTOR: Okay,"
679,
680,I'm wondering why the Frost Fair's
681,on this part of the river.
682,
683,I bet that at least one of you knows
684,
685,who paid Kitty
686,to take people out on the ice.

689,HARRIET: Dottie! 
690,
691,DOCTOR: A ship?

693,
694,PERRY: Not that kind of ship.  
695,HARRIET: Perry!  
696,PERRY: What? 
697,
698,KITTIE: It's all right. You can tell him. 
699,
700,DOTTIE: It's a drawing.
701,
702,Here. On his hand. 
703,
704,"BILL: So, this guy,"
705,where would we find him? 
706,
707,HARRIET: He finds us. 
708,
709,"BILL: But a tattoo on his hand,"
710,"I mean, we could ask around? "
711,
712,DOCTOR: Boring!
713,
714,I know something
715,that's much easier to find.

727,"BILL: Yeah, my hair was cringing. "
728,DOCTOR: Awesome.

737,frozen under the Thames
738,
739,and it's eating people. 
740,BILL: Okay. 
741,
742,DOCTOR: Proposal. We need to get
743,a closer look it.  
744,"BILL: Good, yeah. "
745,
746,DOCTOR: Plan. Let's get eaten. 
747,(The Doctor has acquired a cart and is unloading brass and canvas or leather clothing from it.) 
748,BILL: Is this stuff safe? 
749,
750,DOCTOR: Potentially.

752,What does potentially mean? 
753,
754,"DOCTOR: Safe, with a frisson of excitement. "
755,
756,"BILL: Right, but we're not going to be like completely"
757,"defenceless down there, though? "
758,
759,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no."
760,
761,Well yes. But don't worry about it. 
762,
763,BILL: Why not?
764,
765,What have you got up your sleeve?
766,
767,"Oh, my God!"

771,"magical, alien powers? "

777,[Frost Fair]
778,
779,(Night. They have lanterns.) 
780,BILL: Why do we need diving suits
781,on top of the ice? 
782,
783,"DOCTOR: If we're lucky, the lights"
784,will come and take us under.
785,
786,"Whatever they are, they're clever."
787,
788,"When they went after the boy,"
789,
790,they waited until he was away

792,(The Doctor has moved away with his back to Bill. Their boots appear to

795,diving helmet.) 
796,BILL: What?
797,
798,Did you say something? 
799,
800,"DOCTOR: The question is, how? "
801,(Bill spots the green lights starting to surround her.) 
802,BILL: Doctor? Oh. Ah. 
803,
804,Doctor?
805,
806,Doctor!
807,
808,Doctor! 
809,
810,(She throws her lantern at his back and he turns around just in time to 
811,see her fall through the ice. The air hose is uncoiling rapidly.)

834,(The Pie-Man flees. The Doctor takes his diver's helmet off.)

842,"but that noise, "
843,
844,it's like I felt it

847,"It sounded like, like "

863,
864,BILL: I ate that pie. I liked that pie. 
865,
866,DOCTOR: Definitely not carnivores.

868,Which means you're cooperating with
869,"the creature, providing for it."
870,
871,"What do you get in return, hmm?"
872,
873,What did it take for you
874,to evolve into that?

1027,
1028,"Yes, we need to use code "

1038,"OVERSEER: No more than I do, sir. "

1040,"DOCTOR: Yes, but you are someone"
1041,who knows more than he tells. 
1042,
1043,OVERSEER: I'm not one to speculate. 
1044,

1046,you're a man of intelligence. 
1047,
1048,"OVERSEER: They won't let us smoke in here,"
1049,so I assume it's fuel.

1117,
1118,DOCTOR: Possibly. 
1119,BILL: Because the creature is an alien. 
1120,
1121,DOCTOR: It certainly appears
1122,to be producing fuel

1286,A life without privilege.

1288,"The boy who died on the river,"
1289,that boy's value is your value.
1290,
1291,That's what defines an age.
1292,That's what defines a species. 
1293,
1294,SUTCLIFFE: What a beautiful speech.
1295,
1296,"The rhythm and, and vocabulary,"
1297,
1298,quite outstanding.
1299,
1300,It's enough to move anyone 
1301,
1302,with an ounce of compassion.
1303,
1304,"So, it's really not your day, is it? "
1305,
1306,"If they know about the beast,"
1307,"then others must, too."

1314,In daylight.

1317,
1318,(The henchmen takes the Doctor and Bill outside and put them in a carriage with the blinds pulled down.) 
1319,BILL: No time for outrage.
1320,
1321,You've never had time for anything
1322,"else, right?  "
1323,DOCTOR: Don't be smug.
1324,
1325,Smug belongs to me. 
1326,
1327,BILL: Are you really two thousand years old? 
1328,
1329,DOCTOR: Why? 
1330,
1331,BILL: I just wanted to know
1332,how long it takes 
1333,
1334,before you can make a speech
1335,like the one you just made.
1336,
1337,It was worth the wait.

1349,Sit down and shut up. 
1350,(There are wires leading from a long panel to many barrels.) 
1351,BILL: It could be rum.
1352,
1353,Rum came in barrels. 
1354,"(The Doctor and Bill are seated back to back either side of the main pole, where the wire panel also hangs, and tied together.) "
1355,"DOCTOR: Nah, smell that."

1357,"It's their home-made rocket fuel,"
1358,redeployed as explosive.

1372,a fireworks display

1383,out presently.
1384,
1385,We won't get bigger crowds
1386,"than that,"
1387,
1388,so make sure you're
1389,off the ice by noon. 
1390,
1391,BILL: Noon? There's no way you can
1392,keep us here that long.
1393,
1394,We'll just scream our heads off. 
1395,
1396,"DOCTOR: No. No, please, please, please "

1398,(But she is drowned out by the cries of the people watching the 
1399,"sword-swallower, and the acrobat, and the strongman bending iron rods "

1401,WATERMAN : Sixpence to the waterman. 
1402,(The henchman leaves.) 
1403,BILL: elp! (coughs) 
1404,"DOCTOR: If you're quite finished,"
1405,
1406,I could use some help. 
1407,BILL: Eh? 
1408,
1409,DOCTOR: Sonic screwdriver. Inside pocket. 
1410,"BILL: Oh, okay. "
1411,(She nudges his pocket with her elbow. The screwdriver flies out onto the ice. Bill edges back to reach it with her foot.) 
1412,"BILL: Yeah, bit more. "
1413,
1414,DOCTOR: Kick it!  
1415,"BILL: Ah, okay. "

1425,(A green light is moving towards them.) 
1426,DOCTOR: Huh?
1427,
1428,"Oh, hello! "

1430,BILL: How are you doing that? 
1431,
1432,DOCTOR: Er.
1433,
1434,Sonic screwdriver.
1435,
1436,It makes a noise. That's how
1437,the fish choose a victim. 
1438,
1439,That's how they know they've
1440,isolated someone on the ice. 
1441,
1442,BILL: Er better question. 
1443,Why are you doing that? 
1444,
1445,"DOCTOR: Just, just a little more. "
1446,"(Outside, a lot of green lights hurry past the Dowell's feet. He sees them and looks inside.) "

1448,
1449,Give me that!

1453,There's a button on the side. 
1454,
1455,(Dowell searches for it.) 
1456,
1457,DOCTOR: Here! Give it here!
1458,
1459,"(He throws the screwdriver to the Doctor, whose hands are free, then falls through the ice.) "
1460,
1461,DOCTOR: Afraid it has a knack to it. 
1462,(Bill watches the hole seal up again.) 
1463,DOCTOR: Bill. Miss Potts? 
1464,I need you with me. 
1465,
1466,"BILL: I, I "
1467,
1468,"DOCTOR: Things to do, Bill. Decisions to"

1470,
1471,BILL: Tiny?  
1472,DOCTOR: The creature.
1473,The loch-less monster.
1474,
1475,The not-so-little mermaid. Are we
1476,just going to leave her down there? 
1477,
1478,BILL: We can't set her free.
1479,
1480,She could burst up out of the water
1481,and eat a hundred people
1482,
1483,right off of Southbank!
1484,She could eat half of London! 
1485,
1486,DOCTOR: She might. It's a risk.
1487,
1488,"So, what do you want to do, Bill? "
1489,
1490,BILL: We already know the answers.
1491,
1492,Why are you even asking? 
1493,DOCTOR: I don't know the answers.
1494,
1495,Only idiots know the answers.
1496,
1497,But if your future is built
1498,"on the suffering of that creature,"
1499,
1500,what's your future worth? 
1501,
1502,BILL: Why is it up to me? 
1503,
1504,DOCTOR: Because it can't be up to me.

1514,I need an order.

1526,BILL: Not here. 
1527,
1528,KITTIE: What's he doing?

1573,Run!

1575,Now!

1577,"primes his generator and pushes the lever. His henchmen cringe, "
1578,"expecting a boom, but nothing happens. "
1579,"Inside the fireworks tent the sonic screwdriver is whirring away, but "
1580,"the barrels have gone. They are attached to the creature's chains, and "
1581,Sutcliffe doesn't know he's just set 
1582,"them off, freeing her.) "

1589,"(The Doctor, in a diving suit, climbs out of a well or similar structure"
1590, at the workhouse. The creature is loose. Sutcliffe enters the tent and 
1591,"sees the screwdriver, then hears ice "
1592,cracking and goes outside again. A scaly dorsal fin breaks the ice in 
1593,"front of him, then a crevasse runs between his legs. He falls into the "
