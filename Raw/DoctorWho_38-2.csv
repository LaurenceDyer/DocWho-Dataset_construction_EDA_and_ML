21,"DOCTOR: Hi, Doctor. Oh! Hi. How are you doing? Good. Just talking to myself to prove I'm still alive. I was wondering. What would you say to the others if they were here? "
22,Don't panic.
23,
24,[Aeroplane]
25,
26,GRAHAM: Yaz! Hold on! 
27,(But they can't hold on. Ryan falls and spots a small plaque with his name on it.) 
28,RYAN: What? 
29,"DOCTOR : Of course, I'm usually saying it as much to myself as I am to them."
30,
31,[Alien realm]
32,
33,"DOCTOR: Always a good reminder when you're alone, in the unknown, all hope lost."
34,
35,[Aeroplane]
36,
37,(There are other small plaques further along. Ryan Sinclair and a left arrow.) 
38,RYAN: No way.
39,
40,[Alien realm]
41,
42,(She tries the sonic screwdriver.) 
43,DOCTOR: Won't work in here. Why not? Could be a clue. A clue to what? 
44,(A bolt of energy zips past.) 
45,"DOCTOR: What was that? Interesting. Useful, maybe. Another! Even better. What are you? Pathways? Signals? Synapses? "
46,"I could be inside something. Oh, I hope it's not a liver. I hate being inside livers. People always get so offended. What are you doing in my liver again?  "
47,ADA : Hello? Hello? Hello?
48,
49,[Aeroplane]
50,
51,(And the next plaque.) 
52,RYAN: 4C seat pocket. 
53,(Which contains a handy piece of paper entitled - How To Land A Plane Without A Cockpit - with diagrams.) 
54,RYAN: No way. Hey! Hey! I've got a plan.
55,
56,[Alien realm]
57,
58,(Running.) 
59,"DOCTOR: Can you hear me? I'm trying to find you, somehow. Ah! "
60,(A young woman in early 19th clothes - just pre-Victorian.) 
61,ADA: Please be assured all this will pass. I shall be recovered momentarily.
62,
63,[Aeroplane]
64,
65,GRAHAM: Open panel in floor. 
66,RYAN: What does it say next? 
67,GRAHAM: Connect the cable to your phone. 
68,"(He does, and the Doctor appears on a screen nearby.) "
69,DOCTOR [on screen]: Welcome aboard. 
70,GRAHAM: You are kidding! How's she doing that? 
71,DOCTOR [on screen]: I realise you have questions.  
72,GRAHAM: Where are you? We're going to die! 
73,"DOCTOR [on screen]: First of all, you're not going to die. Second of all, don't talk back to the screens. Obviously, I'm a recording and I can't hear you. "
74,"Third, don't panic. Especially you, Graham. "
75,GRAHAM: I'm not panicking! 
76,"DOCTOR [on screen]: Yes, you were. And I did just say don't talk back to the screens.  "
77,GRAHAM: Eh? 
78,DOCTOR [on screen]: Haven't got long. The bomb in the cockpit knocked out the signals from the computer to the engines. But the computers in this 
79,"aircraft aren't in the cockpit, they're under the cabin floor. Ryan, the app should have opened. "
80,RYAN: What app? Eh? 
81,(Phone - Hiya Ryan! Opening - Piloting Made Easy.) 
82,RYAN: How was this installed on me phone? 
83,"DOCTOR : Use it to communicate with the engines via the aircraft wiring. By the way, you have shut the cockpit door, haven't you? That's vital. "
84,Cockpit doors are designed to be incredibly robust. 
85,GRAHAM: I'll do it! 
86,DOCTOR [on screen]: Now pay attention. Do this fast. I'm worried you might lose me if there's a power surge.  
87,RYAN: Lost her. 
88,YASMIN: Press the cursor up! We've got to stop this plane from going down! 
89,"RYAN: Up, up, up! "
90,"(Graham gets the cockpit door closed, then the plane tilts up.) "
91,GRAHAM: Too many ups! Level out! Level out! 
92,(He goes sliding on his back down the fuselage.)
93,
94,[Alien realm]
95,
96,"DOCTOR: When you say recovered, what do you mean? "
97,ADA: The paralysis will fade. 
98,DOCTOR: You don't look paralysed. 
99,"ADA: Not in this realm, but in my earthly aspect. "
100,DOCTOR: Right. What's your name? 
101,ADA: I am Ada.  
102,"DOCTOR: And what do you think this realm is, Ada? "
103,ADA: I believe it to be my mind. Though I have not met another here before. 
104,DOCTOR: Then what do you think I am? 
105,ADA: I presume you are a consequence of my thoughts. 
106,"DOCTOR: No. I'm the Doctor, and I'm very real. But you've been here before? "
107,"ADA: Many times. When the paralysis subsides, I find myself fully back in my body, restored in the physical realm. "
108,"If you are real, do you have your own solution for egress from here? "
109,DOCTOR: No exit strategy. 
110,(Some energy bolts crackle around.) 
111,"DOCTOR: Before I leave, I need to work out what this place is. Oh! Those fragments of light or energy, why are they surrounding you? "
112,ADA: They are always here with me. They place a word in my mind. Kasaavin? 
113,(One of the light creatures appears.) 
114,"DOCTOR: Ada, step away. "
115,ADA: Do not be afraid. This is my guardian.  
116,"DOCTOR: This is their realm. This is where they're from. But how did you bring us here? Unless... You can't be. But you must be. What, gateways? "
117,"We go through you and arrive in your realm? I say realm. It's not a planet, not really a void. A separate dimension? Are we beyond our... my universe? "
118,"ADA: Little of what you are saying makes sense to me, but I am concerned you'll be marooned here. When my guardian has returned... "
119,DOCTOR: They're not your guardians. 
120,ADA: I can offer you my hand. We may leave this place together. 
121,DOCTOR: I don't think that will work.  
122,"ADA: How will you know if you do not try? Decide, Doctor. "
123,"(Ada holds out her hand, the Doctor takes and they both vanish.)"
124,
125,[Aeroplane]
126,
127,"GRAHAM: You got us level, Ryan. Good lad. "
128,"RYAN: I can fly a plane! Can't ride a bike, but I can fly a plane. Hey, look. Barton must have programmed in a flight pattern before he left the cockpit. "
129,Looks like this app's keying into it. 
130,YASMIN: How did the Doctor do this? 
131,GRAHAM: No idea. But now we've got to stay on a plane without a cockpit till it decides where to land.
132,
133,[Master's Tardis]
134,
135,(The homestead is whirling through the Vortex - rather like Ashildr and Clara's Tardis is an American Diner...) 
136,MASTER: You should've seen me. I was great! She did not have a clue. 
137,BARTON: This better work. 
138,"MASTER: Final calibrations, and then we'll be ready. All our efforts will come together in a moment of beauty. "
139,(The silver figure in the case from Barton's office is there.) 
140,MASTER: We'll all have what we want. 
141,"BARTON: So you know, I don't appreciate last-minute changes of plan as I'm about to take off. "
142,MASTER: A little chaos is a wonderful thing. Allowed me to swat those flies. 
143,(Barton's phone beeps.) 
144,BARTON: I've just been notified. My plane's about to land at its programmed destination. 
145,MASTER: They can't have survived. 
146,BARTON: You told me everything was foolproof. What's gone wrong? 
147,"MASTER: Watch your tone, Mister Barton. I'm not your employee. "
148,(An alarm goes off. The Master bangs his head against the console.) 
149,MASTER: How has she got there? 
150,BARTON: What's happened? 
151,"MASTER: Nothing I can't deal with. I'll drop you at your plane. You sort out her friends, I'll deal with the Doctor."
152,
153,[The Royal Gallery of Practical Science]
154,
155,(A scientific exposition is in full sales mode.) 
156,"DOCTOR: Ah. I'm getting 19th century? Early, with a touch of mid. Top notes... London. Steam? Why am I getting steam?  "
157,MAN: Nations shall cower in fear as my steam gun fires one thousand bearings per minute. 
158,MAN 2: See the mouse survive inside our revolutionary diving bell! 
159,AMERICAN: Touch the magneto. Powerful shocks. 
160,"MAN 3: The perfect modern defence, a grenade for the home. Intruders repelled with force. "
161,ADA + DOCTOR: It worked! 
162,"BABBAGE: Miss Gordon, are you recovered? "
163,(He helps her up off the floor.) 
164,ADA: I am. Thank you. Me too. 
165,DOCTOR: Thanks for asking. 
166,"BABBAGE: Madam, this gallery is full of the extraordinary, but your apparition just now was... impossible. How did you do it? "
167,"DOCTOR: Er... I am bound never to reveal my secrets. Go about your day, knowing that you may tell people you were privileged to witness the Marvellous "
168,Apparating Man! Lady. Apparating Lady! Every time. 
169,(The people applaud.) 
170,"DOCTOR: The year, right now, would be what? "
171,"BABBAGE: The year, madam, remains 1834. "
172,"DOCTOR: Yes. (steps aside to soliliquise) Marooned in the 19th century. Hold on in there, fam."
173,
174,[Airfield]
175,
176,BARTON: And there was no one on board? 
177,"GROUND STAFF: No, sir. It appears the craft landed itself via automation. Sir, we have had this conversation before. If you're going to be testing "
178,"these sort of systems, we really need to be kept fully in the loop. I'm going to have to do some tricky smoothing-over with the Civil Aviation Authority. "
179,
180,[Hangar]
181,
182,"(Ryan, Yasmin and Graham are hiding, watching and whispering.) "
183,YASMIN: How'd he get here so quick? 
184,RYAN: I dunno.  
185,"GRAHAM: Where is here, anyway? "
186,(Ryan checks his phone.) 
187,RYAN: Britain. We're home. Almost. Essex?  
188,"GRAHAM: Essex. That is my manor. We are golden. What do we do, though? "
189,YASMIN: Figure out what Barton and O are planning. That's what the Doctor'd do. 
190,GRAHAM: Yeah.  
191,YASMIN: If she was here. 
192,"GRAHAM: No, she'll be all right, Yaz. Just got to believe. "
193,YASMIN: You didn't see that place. 
194,"RYAN: Hey, still got access to Barton's diary. He's giving a keynote speech in London tomorrow night.  "
195,GRAHAM: That is where we have got to get to. 
196,"RYAN: Yeah, without him knowing we're still alive. "
197,YASMIN: So let's get moving. 
198,
199,[Airfield]
200,
201,(Barton makes a call.) 
202,BARTON: I need tracking intel on three people. As soon as you can! These are their names.
203,
204,[The Royal Gallery of Practical Science]
205,
206,"ADA: Now we are safe, Doctor, will you reveal a little more concerning how you came to be "
207,(The Doctor touches the magneto and gets a shock.) 
208,DOCTOR: Ow!  
209,"ADA: ..in that place and, indeed, who you are?  "
210,DOCTOR: I'm a traveller in Space and Time. I was in the middle of dealing with a planet-threatening 
211,conspiracy two centuries from now when I was attacked by an old enemy and exiled to the place where I found you. Oh!  
212,"(The Doctor picks up the grenade, then hands it off to Ada.) "
213,"ADA: I am not a fool, Doctor. "
214,DOCTOR: And I'm not treating you as one. This conspiracy involves those creatures you think are your guardians. They're in alliance with a renegade 
215,"from my home planet and a 21st-century tech inventor. 186 years from now, they're assassinating spies, and I am stuck here without my Tardis, "
216,and I need to find my way back before... 
217,"(Enter the Master, looking more like a Mister Hyde than anything else.) "
218,"MASTER: Ladies and gentlemen! See the incredible shrinking device! Want to be smaller, ladies? You can! "
219,(He zaps a nearby woman into a tiny doll. Panic ensues.) 
220,"MASTER: Who's next? You, sir. "
221,"DOCTOR: Go, Ada. You too. Go! "
222,(The Master holds out the miniature people.) 
223,"MASTER: Ah, the happy couple. "
224,(And throws them away.) 
225,DOCTOR: I said go. 
226,MASTER: Do not move! Hands on heads. Hands on heads! 
227,"DOCTOR: Let them go, and you can have me. "
228,MASTER: I've got you anyway. Did you just move? Did you move?  
229,WOMAN: No! 
230,"MASTER: Oh, my mistake. Sorry. Sorry. (he shrinks the woman) When I kill them, Doctor, it gives me a little buzz. Right here, in the hearts. It's like... "
231,"How would I describe it? It's like... It's like knowing I'm in the right place, doing what I was made for. "
232,DOCTOR: What do you want? 
233,"MASTER: Kneel. Kneel, or they all die. (she kneels) Call me by my name.  "
234,DOCTOR: Master. 
235,MASTER: Beg your pardon? 
236,DOCTOR: Master. 
237,"MASTER: Can't hear you, love. "
238,DOCTOR: Master. 
239,"MASTER: When I arrange for your death, I expect you to stay dead. How did you escape? How did you end up here? "
240,"DOCTOR: Ah, you don't know. You're not in control of these creatures. I bet you don't even know what they are. "
241,"MASTER: They're called the Kasaavin, and we have interests in common. "
242,"DOCTOR: You, Barton, and a race you barely know? That's one uneasy alliance. Trust each other, do you? "
243,"(Ada is moving, slowly.) "
244,"MASTER: Oh, completely. By the way, I bring news from home. "
245,"ADA: Down, Doctor! "
246,(The steam machine gun rattles.) 
247,MAN: This is not designed for use by a young lady!  
248,ADA: Nothing is. And yet I find myself more than capable. 
249,(One of the bearings hits the Master in the right upper arm.) 
250,"ADA: All of you, out! "
251,"DOCTOR: Ada, I really do not approve. "
252,"MASTER: Run all you like, Doctor. You won't get far without a Tardis. "
253,(Ada pulls the pin on the grenade.) 
254,DOCTOR: Don't have a Tardis.  
255,(Ada bowls the grenade at the Master.)  
256,DOCTOR: Do have an Ada.
257,
258,[Street]
259,
260,RYAN: It's hard not to stand out in this gear. 
261,GRAHAM: Yeah. 
262,"YASMIN: We've been on a night out. We're just coming home, that's all. Nothing weird about that. "
263,(Their phones ring.) 
264,"BARTON: Hello, friends. Or should I say plane thieves? What, did you think I wouldn't be able to track you? We have your numbers, e-mails, GPS. "
265,"I even know how many more stamps you need for a free coffee. So close, Ryan. Or should I say Logan? Look up. "
266,(Their images appear on an advertising screen saying Wanted. Do Not Approach. Report any sighting to your local police or call Crime Prevention on 0800 999 999) 
267,"BARTON: Your passports have been revoked, your bank cards are frozen. We have a record of everyone you know - friends, family, colleagues, everyone you ever followed"
268,"on social media. Of course, we have cameras everywhere, and now you're wanted for hijacking. Go on, go off-grid. See how long you last. "
269,(Ryan drops his phone and jumps on it.) 
270,"RYAN: Hey, smash your phones now. "
271,BARTON: Aw! Yasmin Khan is phoning her mum. 
272,(Graham stomps on his phone.) 
273,GRAHAM: He don't half go on. 
274,NAJIA : Yaz? 
275,"YASMIN: Hello. It's me. Listen, don't listen to anything you hear. "
276,(Ryan grabs her phone and smashes it.) 
277,YASMIN: Ryan!  
278,RYAN: You're not hearing. We have to go dark. 
279,GRAHAM: Run.
280,
281,[Babbage's home]
282,
283,BABBAGE: Surely we must alert the authorities? 
284,DOCTOR: The authorities won't be any help. 
285,"ADA: Besides, what would we tell them, Mister Babbage? "
286,"BABBAGE: I have no concept, Ada. I cannot explain any of what I have seen today. "
287,DOCTOR: Babbage? Charles Babbage?  
288,BABBAGE: Yes.  
289,DOCTOR: So this must be... 
290,BABBAGE: My Difference Engine. 
291,DOCTOR: Your Difference Engine! 
292,BABBAGE: Oh. You...you know of it? 
293,"DOCTOR: Er, just in passing. "
294,(She sets the lovely brass cogwheels inscribed with numbers moving.) 
295,BABBAGE: As yet unfinished. It will count and perform quadratic equations. 
296,"DOCTOR: If you're Charles Babbage, then you're not just any old Ada. You're Ada Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron and Annabella Milbanke, one of the great minds. "
297,"ADA: I am Ada Gordon, madam.  "
298,"DOCTOR: 1834. Of course you are. Well, maybe one day, who knows, you might meet a nice Earl. This changes everything! This isn't an accident. "
299,Ada Lovelace in Babbage's house? You're clues. You're important.  
300,"BABBAGE: I'm delighted to hear it, madam. "
301,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's not good news. What's that? "
302,"BABBAGE: This is the Silver Lady. A revolutionary piece of engineering. But, like all great ladies, she is as much for decoration as for purpose. "
303,(The figurine that Barton and the Master have.) 
304,DOCTOR: How did you come by this? 
305,"BABBAGE: It was a gift, delivered by a young man who said it was a token of appreciation from his master. "
306,DOCTOR: Was it. What does it do? 
307,"BABBAGE: It... moves. And on occasion, projects. "
308,"(The Doctor looks at the notes and sketches in Babbages book, which includes a light creature.) "
309,DOCTOR: On occasion projects something like this? 
310,"ADA: M... Mister Babbage, you have seen the same form. "
311,"BABBAGE: Madam, those are my private notes. "
312,DOCTOR: The Master and the Kasaavin. What are they doing? 
313,"BABBAGE: Er, do you understand her, Miss Gordon? "
314,"ADA: Not in the least, Mister Babbage. "
315,"DOCTOR: Ada, when was your first paralysis?  "
316,"ADA: I was 13 years old. That is when I was first transported to the place where we met, and I first saw an apparition. "
317,"DOCTOR: And over the years, the paralysis recurs with the same effect? "
318,ADA: Yes. No doctor has ever been able to diagnose the cause.  
319,"DOCTOR: Well, this Doctor may be able to. An apparition, from this machine.  "
320,BABBAGE: Correct.  
321,"DOCTOR: So, they take you, Ada, multiple times from here and they study you in their dimension, which means they can't be in this dimension for long. "
322,"But maybe they gain an ally, a mastermind who builds them a machine which stabilises them in this world long enough for them to send "
323,spies and to spread their work and start a plan. 'Cause I've seen the map in his hut. Multiple Earths. Except not. Not multiple Earths. 
324,"Multiple time periods. These creatures aren't just alien spies on Earth, they're spies through Time, through history, starting with you. "
325,(The Doctor sonicks the figurine.) 
326,ADA: What are you doing? 
327,"DOCTOR: The man from the Adelaide Gallery will be coming for me. I need to get back to where I came from, find my friends and figure this out.  "
328,(A Kasaavin appears.) 
329,"DOCTOR: And I've only got one way out of here. The same way I came in. If I use my sonic on the Silver Lady, I might be able to force this creature to throw me "
330,back to the 21st century. I hope.  
331,"ADA: If this is your plan, it is fraught with risk. "
332,"DOCTOR: Where there's risk, there's hope. Deep breath. "
333,(Ada takes the Doctor's hand.) 
334,"DOCTOR: Ada, no! "
335,(And they both vanish. Babbage drinks a large brandy.)
336,
337,[Building site]
338,
339,(For a new housing estate.)  
340,"GRAHAM: No one living here yet. No CCTV, no neighbourhood watch. The one on the end. Go on. "
341,(Inside a breezeblock shell with plastic sheeting at the windows and some handy work benches to sit on.) 
342,YASMIN: What if the Doctor doesn't come back? What if we never see her again? 
343,"RYAN: We keep going. Stop Barton. Get rid of those creatures, whatever they are. "
344,GRAHAM: Ryan's right. We carry on doing what the Doc would want us to do. 
345,"RYAN: I'm sorry, did you just say, Ryan's right? "
346,"GRAHAM: Yes, I did. Enjoy the moment, son. You won't hear it often. "
347,"RYAN: And that O guy. If the Doctor knew him, how come she couldn't recognise him?  "
348,"GRAHAM: In the outback, he said that he knew the Doc when she was a man. And that first night we met, she told me and Grace that she'd been through er... "
349,something called... regeneration. Like her whole body had changed. 
350,YASMIN: We've spent all this time with her and we don't even know where she's from. 
351,"GRAHAM: Yeah, not for want of asking, though. Eh? I mean. And we will ask, when we see her again, which we will, cos she is safe somewhere, of course. Right? "
352,YASMIN: Right.  
353,RYAN: Right. 
354,YASMIN: You know what she'd ask now? What do we have at our disposal?  
355,"GRAHAM: Well, I've er... got to admit I did keep a couple of those spy gadgety things. "
356,"RYAN: Me too. Hey, are you wearing the laser shoes? "
357,GRAHAM: I might be. 
358,YASMIN: Why didn't you use them on the plane? 
359,"GRAHAM: What, in a confined space like that? You're having a laugh, in't ya? That wouldn't have been very smart, would it? And besides which, I forgot "
360,to read the instructions. 
361,YASMIN: Graham! 
362,"GRAHAM: Well, we was in a rush. What could I do? "
363,"RYAN: Rocket cufflinks. To be fair, I didn't read the instructions on those either. "
364,GRAHAM: You doughnut. 
365,RYAN + YASMIN: Doughnut? 
366,"GRAHAM: Yeah, the pair of you. Right couple of doughnuts. But there's no one I'd rather be on the run with. "
367,(Kasaavin come out of the ground outside.)
368,
369,[Bombsite]
370,
371,DOCTOR: What? No. 
372,(A small propeller aircraft flies overhead. The Doctor and Ada are lying on the ground.) 
373,DOCTOR: Ada. Are you okay? 
374,ADA: Are we safe? 
375,(Bombing in the background. A woman runs up.) 
376,NOOR: Don't move. I said don't move!  
377,DOCTOR: We're not hostile. We're here by accident. 
378,NOOR: What are you doing out here? What are you wearing? 
379,ADA: What are those noises? 
380,DOCTOR: Where are we? And when? 
381,NOOR: Don't you know? 
382,DOCTOR: Just landed. Concussion. Humour me. 
383,"NOOR: Paris, 1943. "
384,(German shouting.) 
385,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. "
386,"NOOR: It's a patrol. Inside, quick. We're not safe out here. "
387,(They run for cover. The German military car stops and a very Non-Aryan officer steps out.) 
388,MASTER: I know you're here! I will find you! 
389,(His gizmo beeps.) 
390,"MASTER: Especially you, Doctor. Coming, ready or not."
391,
392,[Building site]
393,
394,(A Kasaavin enters the house shell.) 
395,YASMIN: Did you just say something? 
396,(And another.) 
397,"GRAHAM: Ryan, come on! "
398,(One blocks the bottom of the stairs.)

419,"I text. I e-mail. I tried to friend you on Facebook, and you refused. And trust me, I never use Facebook unless forced. "
420,MOTHER: Why am I here? 
421,BARTON: I'm in the country. I thought it would be nice for us to see each other. Thanks for coming.
422,MOTHER: I didn't have a choice. 
423,"BARTON: I keep wondering, does she know? Does she realise that I'm one of the most successful men on the planet? I've changed the world. "
424,What do I have to do to get you to say well done? 
425,MOTHER: Well done. Are we finished?

437,"(The Doctor and Ada are hiding under the floorboards, with a radio transmitter. The Master stamps his foot and the troopers fire their machineguns at the "
438,"floor. Noor doesn't flinch. The Germans and the Master leave, a door closes. Noor gets up, moves a small rug and removes floorboards.) "
439,DOCTOR: You are a life-saver. Got some interesting stuff under the floorboards here. Wireless radio equipment. As issued by the British 
440,"Special Operations Executive. Very distinct, very large and very difficult to hide. You're not Parisian. You're a British spy. I know that face. "
441,Code name Madeleine. Real name Noor Inayat Khan. First female wireless operator to be dropped behind enemy lines. Very nice to meet you. 
442,"I'm not where I wanted to be, but I can work with this. Ada, wait till you hear about Noor. She's as impressive as you. You grabbing my hand must have "
443,"thrown us off course, spat us out here.  "
444,ADA: I should like to come out from the floor now. 
445,NOOR: Oh.  
446,(A little later.) 
447,NOOR: Who are you? How do you know so much about me? And why are you both wearing such strange clothes? 
448,ADA: That soldier's voice. He was in the Adelaide Gallery. How can he be here? 
449,"DOCTOR: He's in league with the Kasaavin, those creatures of light. I'd hoped to get back to their home dimension, where we met, "
450,"and then to the 21st century. But we ended up here instead, which is, you know, 19th century to 20th, it's progress. But the Master tracked me down, "
451,"and now he wants me dead, whereas I am a big fan of being alive. Ada? Are you all right? "
452,(Ada moves a shutter aside and looks out of the dirty windows towards the Tour Effiel.) 
453,ADA: I have always wanted to return to Paris. 
454,"NOOR: It's not at its best. Nightly bombing raids. Millions dead. They promised us war at this scale would never happen again, and yet here we are. "

456,NOOR: Who are you people? 
457,"DOCTOR: We're your allies, I promise.  "
458,ADA: This is the future. A world on fire. 
459,"DOCTOR: These are the dark times. But they don't sustain. Darkness never sustains, even though sometimes it feels like it might. I need to turn this "
460,"to our advantage and get the Master off my trail. He's masquerading as a German soldier. That's a low, even for him. Code name Madeleine, what "
461,equipment do you have here? 
462,NOOR: Only my radio equipment. No gun. No cyanide pill. I'm a pacifist. 
463,DOCTOR: Snap! Strong position to take during wartime. Two pacifists and a 19th-century descendant of Byron against the Nazis in Paris 
464,and an alien invasion across multiple dimensions. That's a big to-do list. (sigh) I have an idea. And you two brilliant people are a big part of it.

512,MASTER: Painful.  
513,DOCTOR: I don't like what you're wearing. Or the company you keep. How have you managed that? You're not exactly their Aryan archetype.

515,DOCTOR: I'm assuming it was you who hijacked the MI6 car. 
516,MASTER: That was fun. 
517,DOCTOR: And assassinated C. 
518,MASTER: Mandraffian laser rifle. One shot. I've still got an eye for it. 
519,DOCTOR: Why were the Kasaavin assassinating spies? 
520,MASTER: Earth's intelligence services started to realise their presence. 
521,"DOCTOR: So, what, you brought the Kasaavin to Earth? "
522,"MASTER: They were already here. I just persuaded them we had interests in common. The Kasaavin are embedded across the whole of this universe, "
523,"spies from another dimension. As I said to Mister Barton, think of them as Russia, but bigger. Sleeper agents everywhere, waiting to be activated, "
524,"amassing information in case they need to attack. And, I mean, you know me. I can't help myself. I have to stick my oar in. "

538,"GRAHAM: So what are you, part alien? "
539,BARTON: You really don't understand who I am. I build things. I test them. So I let them test a tiny part of me. And now it's time for the global roll-out.

569,MASTER: Why didn't you die when the Kasaavin attacked you? 
570,"DOCTOR: Me and Yaz, both time travellers, fizzing with artron energy, and my DNA not matching the rest of humanity, we confused them. And I don't think "
571,they're as stable in this dimension as they'd like to be. What deal have you made with them? 
572,"MASTER: I showed them and Barton what was possible. They helped me lay a trap for you, and I raised their ambitions. Of course, ultimately "
573,"the Kasaavin are just the mechanism. They... they don't have my vision, you know? "

580,"MASTER: Why would it stop? I mean, how else would I get your attention? When did you last go home? "
581,DOCTOR: What do you mean? 
582,"MASTER: I took a trip home, to Gallifrey, hiding in its little bubble universe. Not sure how to describe what I found. Pulverised? Burned? Nuked? "
583,"All of the above. Someone destroyed it. Our home, razed to the ground. Everyone killed. Everything burned. "
584,DOCTOR: You're lying. 
585,"MASTER: You should really take a look. Oh, wait, you won't be able to. I just thought I'd let you know before I... "
586,DOCTOR: Can you hear voices?  
587,MASTER: Why are there troops coming up the stairs? 
588,"DOCTOR: Oh. That's me, and one of Blighty's bravest radio operators. Very good at sending messages, particularly fake ones designed to be intercepted. "

612,"I know you think I'm mad, but give me five minutes and you'll think I'm the sanest person alive. Okay, that was an overstatement. "
613,"I said the Master's arrogant, but arrogance can trip you up.  "

772,(The Doctor gets a sudden headache and flashes of images.) 
773,VOICES: The Timeless Child. The Timeless Child.  
774,"MASTER [hologram]: Do you see it? It's buried deep in all our memories. In our identity. I'd tell you more, but... but why would I make it easy for you? "
775,It wasn't for me. 
776,"(Later, having picked up the rest of the 'fam'.) "
777,YASMIN: You okay? You're really quiet. 
778,RYAN: Yeah. You have been for days now. 
779,"GRAHAM: They're right. Five planets, you've barely said a word. "
780,DOCTOR: I'm fine. 
781,GRAHAM: Why don't you ever share anything with us? 
782,DOCTOR: I share stuff. 
783,"GRAHAM: Not about yourself, though.  "
784,"RYAN: Yeah, you know everything about us.  "
785,YASMIN: And we know nothing about you. 
786,GRAHAM: Mmm.  
787,DOCTOR: Fine. What do you want to know? 
788,"GRAHAM: Who are you, Doc? I mean, really. "
789,DOCTOR: I was born on a planet called Gallifrey in the constellation of Kasterborous. I'm a Time Lord. I can regenerate my body. I stole this Tardis and I ran away. 
790,I've been travelling ever since. The Master was one of my oldest friends. We went very different ways. Questions? 
791,GRAHAM: Loads. 
792,YASMIN: Can we visit your home? 
793,DOCTOR: Another time.
