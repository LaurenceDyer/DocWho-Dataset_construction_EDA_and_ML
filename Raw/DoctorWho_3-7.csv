20,Holiday for the Doctor 
21, [Corral] 
22," BALLAD: So fill up your glasses, "
23,And join in the song. 
24,"The law's right behind you, "
25,And it won't take long. 
26,"So come, you coyotes "
27,"And howl at the moon, "
28,"Till there's blood upon the sawdust, "
29,In The Last Chance Saloon. 
30,(Three cowboys ride into the small Arizona mining town of Tombstone.
31,"Just off Main Street lies the OK Corral, as proclaimed by a large"
32,bullet-ridden sign above the entrance. One of the cowboys shoots at
33,it.) 
34,IKE: Now why for did you do a fool thing like that? Save your bullets
35,"for Holliday, boy. "
36,BILLY: I ain't scared of Holliday! 
37,"PHINEAS: Hear that, Ike? Brother Billy ain't scared. "
38,"IKE: Nobody says you was scared, boy. Our brother Reuben, now he wasn't"
39,"scared of him, but that didn't stop Holliday fillin' him full of holes!"
40,
41,PHINEAS: Where do we all meet up with Seth? 
42,IKE: The Last Chance Saloon. 
43,BILLY: What for do we need Seth Harper? 
44,"PHINEAS: Pa's paying him, and Pa wants us to work along with him. "
45,IKE: Come on! 
46,"BALLAD: On your way then you cowboys, "
47,"The time will be soon, "
48,When there's blood upon the sawdust 
49,In the Last Chance Saloon. 
50, [Livery stable] 
51,(As the three Clanton brothers make their way back
52,"towards Main Street, the tall blue shape of a 1960s London police box,"
53,"80 years and 5000 miles out of place, materialises at the back of a"
54,cluttered livery stable to one side of the corral. The door opens and
55,"the Doctor comes out, holding a handkerchief to his mouth.) "
56,STEVEN: What's the matter Doctor? 
57,(Steven and Dodo follow him from the Tardis.) 
58,"DOCTOR: Oh, I've got the most ghastly toothache. It's paralysing pain. "
59,"STEVEN: it serves you right for eating that sweet. Well, aren't there"
60,any painkillers on the Tardis? 
61,DODO: If there's anything I can get you? 
62,"DOCTOR: No, my dear, thank you, no. I shall have to have it out. We've"
63,got to find a dentist. 
64,STEVEN: Where are we? 
65,(Dodo spots the sign over the gate outside.) 
66,STEVEN: It must be in the past sometime. 
67,"DOCTOR: Yes, you're very observant, dear boy, but where? "
68,STEVEN: How would I know? 
69,DODO: I know. 
70,STEVEN: Where? 
71,"DOCTOR: Well, use your eyes, dear boy. Good heavens. "
72,(Steven looks out of the stable door.) 
73,"STEVEN: Tombstone! The OK. Well, that sounds like "
74,DODO: The Wild West! 
75,"STEVEN: It can't be, can it? "
76,DOCTOR: Why not? Fat chance I've got of finding a dentist in the middle
77,West part of 
78,DODO: Yee-hoo! 
79,"DOCTOR: Oh please, must you? "
80,"STEVEN: Look, I've always wanted to be a cowboy, see what it was like"
81,in the Wild West. 
82,"DODO: Hey, they had cowgirls too, didn't they? "
83,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes. "
84,DODO: Ya-hoo! 
85,DOCTOR: What about my tooth!

87, [Last Chance Saloon]
88,
89, BALLAD: It's your last chance of cussing 
90,"At a gunfighter's doom, "
91,It's your last chance of nothin' 
92,At the Last Chance Saloon! 
93,"(Seth Harper is waiting at the bar. Played by  Shane Rimmer, soon"
94,to be the voice of Scott Tracy.) 
95,"HARPER: You took your sweet time gettin' here Clanton. Well, Doc"
96,Holliday arrived here before noon! 
97,"IKE: Rode out as soon as ever I got your wire. Anyways, Holliday'll"
98,"keep for a drink or three, I'd say. "
99,BILLY: Sure enough will. Barman! A bottle and three more glasses. Fast!
100,
101,IKE: You boys know this guy? 
102,"PHINEAS: Yeah, snake-eyes Harper. "
103,HARPER: I don't like being called snake-eyes. Last fellow called me
104,that got himself an extra hole in the head! 
105,"IKE: Sure, Seth, sure. We're friends, ain't we? Ain't we in this"
106,together? 
107,HARPER: Well I'm in it. You're all together on the outside just lookin'
108,in. 
109,PHINEAS: Now that ain't so. We're backing you. You make your play and
110,we gun 'im down. Easy as skinnin' summer fries. 
111,"BILLY: Yeah, that's it. "
112,(The barman looks around anxiously as the four men take their bottle to
113,a table.)
114,
115,[Livery stable]
116,
117," (Steven and Dodo reappear from the Tardis, this"
118,time dressed for the part. Steven with white stetson and fringed shirt
119,is tripping over his spurs and attempting to twirl a pair of
120,pearl-handled six-guns.) 
121,DODO: How do we look? 
122,(Dodo's Mexican ensemble is topped off with a black felt hat.) 
123,"DOCTOR: Oh, good gracious. Absolutely absurd. "
124,DODO: Oh. 
125,DOCTOR: Why you have to dress yourselves up like  Tom Mix I can't
126,imagine. You're asking for trouble. Why can't you wear inconspicuous
127,clothes like I do? 
128,"DODO: Oh, what about me? Don't you like it? "
129,"DOCTOR: Oh, that hat is certainly wrong with it. "
130,"DODO: Oh, it's not supposed to be. That's for you. "
131,"DOCTOR: For me, my dear child? Oh, that's very thoughtful of you, thank"
132,"you. Yes, at least it'll keep the rain off. Yes, it's most suitable."
133,Ow! 
134,STEVEN: Buffalo Bill to the lions. 
135,DOCTOR: What was that? 
136,STEVEN: Nothin' pardner! I was just a-practising mah quick-draw! 
137,"(Steven attempts a draw, but ends up dropping his gun.) "
138,"DOCTOR: Oh, do be careful, dear boy. And remember that belongs to my"
139,favourite collection! 
140,"STEVEN: Now see here, stranger. I reckon you don't know who I is!"
141,"Deadeye Steve. The fastest, meanest gun in the West. "
142,DODO: I think you're smashing. 
143,(Someone shoots the gun out of Steven's hand.) 
144,"DOCTOR: Oh, what on Earth? Are you? And who might you be, sir? "
145,"WYATT: You wanna find out, try movin' fast! Now get over! "
146,(The shooter is a tall mustachioed man with the silver star of a city
147,Marshal pinned to his breast.) 
148,DOCTOR: I don't know who you are or what right you have 
149,WYATT: Marshall of Tombstone's my right and Wyatt Earp's my name. 
150,DODO: Wyatt Earp! 
151,"WYATT: Oh, something wrong, ma'am? "
152,"DODO: Oh no, it's just that, well, I always wanted to meet you and here"
153,we are face to face. 
154,"WYATT: Well, the Lord sure do move in mysterious ways, ma'am. Now maybe"
155,you'll all come along to Sheriff's office? 
156,STEVEN: What on Earth for? 
157,WYATT: So as that you can identify yourself in decent law abiding
158,manner. 
159,"STEVEN: Ah. No, you see, I'm, er, I'm not really a gunman. I was just "
160,"WYATT: Huh. You did kinda make that look obvious didn't ya, boy? That's"
161,why I'm doin' you a favour taking you on in. 
162,STEVEN: Why? 
163,"WYATT: Cos of the Clantons are in town, and, boy, that's mighty"
164,unhealthy for a stranger that calls himself the fastest gun in town.
165,Now pick up yer pea shooter and let's get movin.
166,
167,[Last Chance Saloon]
168,
169,BALLAD: Till there's blood on the sawdust 
170,In the Last Chance Saloon. 
171,"(A buxom young woman enters, catching Billy's appreciative eye.) "
172,"IKE: It just ain't possible, against the four of us? He won't know what"
173,"hit 'im. Hey, Billy? Billy! "
174,(The youngest Clanton is leaning casually against the bar whilst the
175,others sit at the table drinking whiskey and playing cards.) 
176,"BILLY: Yeah. Yeah, it'd be a real shame, I'd like for him to know. I'd"
177,like him to know us for Reuben's brothers. 
178,"HARPER: Look, you don't know Holliday. You want him to come lookin' for"
179,"us, and you ain't even seen 'im? You're crazy. "
180,"PHINEAS: Well, where's he at now? "
181,HARPER: How should I know where he's at? I just know he pulled in here
182,this mornin'. 
183,"PHINEAS: Well, let's get this straight. You mean you don't know where"
184,Holliday? You never met Holliday either? 
185,"HARPER: Look, I don't have to meet 'im, I've seen pictures. I've had"
186,him described to me. Dapper little fellow with a black buck's back
187,"coat, gambler's fancy vest. "
188,"BILLY: So fine, so we'll know him when we find him. So, how do we find"
189,him? 
190,HARPER: We don't have to find him. Ain't you heard o' Holliday's
191,gamblin' n' drinkin'? Now where's the one place in town he's liable to
192,get both? 
193,IKE: Right here. 
194,"HARPER: Yeah. So we just sit here and wait for him, 'n that's all we"
195,gotta do. 
196,"(The woman, having helped herself to liquor, has been listening with"
197,interest. She turns to the barman.) 
198,"KATE: Hey, Charlie. "
199,(Charlie is played by  David
200,Graham - Dalek voice and soon to be Virgil Tracy. Right now
201,he's doing his Brains impersonation.) 
202,KATE: I'll be right back. 
203,CHARLIE: Why? You going'? 
204,KATE: I just thought me of an errand I forgot. 
205,"CHARLIE: Well you'd better be right back, if you aim to keep on workin'"
206,here. 
207,"KATE: Why, of course, Charlie. "
208,"(Picking up her skirt, she swings through the doors.)"
209,
210,[Main Street]
211,
212, BALLAD: With rings on their fingers 
213,And bells on their toes 
214,The girls come to Tombstone 
215,In their high silk hose. 
216,They'll dance on the tables 
217,"Or sing you a tune, "
218,For whatever's in your wallet 
219,At the Last Chance Saloon. 
220,"(At the top of the street, the town's new dentist is setting up shop.) "
221,"HOLLIDAY: Now you move that real easy, real easy. That's my operatin'"
222,"chair. You treat her like she was your Monday bride. Why, Miss Kate,"
223,how are you? 
224,"KATE: Doc Holliday, I gotta talk to you. "
225,HOLLIDAY: Hmm? 
226,KATE: I thought you'd told me you'd given up gunplay like you'd
227,promised. 
228,"HOLLIDAY: Why so I have Kate, and so I be going to. I got myself a"
229,"dentist's shop, regular and permanent, here on Main Street and I am"
230,movin' in.
231,
232,[Dentist's office]
233,
234," KATE: Well you better just move right out again,"
235,cos four men are waitin' for you at the Last Chance this very moment. 
236,HOLLIDAY: Yeah. 
237,"KATE: I'm plum worn out worryin' about you, Doc. All I want is to live"
238,peaceful. 
239,"HOLLIDAY: Hey, so do I, Kate. Who are these men anyway? "
240,"KATE: Well, there's a guy called Seth Harper. "
241,HOLLIDAY: Yeah. 
242,"KATE: Then there's three brothers by the name of, er, Clanton. "
243,"HOLLIDAY: Clanton! You kill a guy out of sheer professional ethics, and"
244,then you've got three of his brothers chasin' after you to leave at
245,once. That makes me real angry! 
246,"KATE: You're through with being angry, Doc. All you're gonna do is get"
247,outta town. 
248,"HOLLIDAY: Oh, that don't appeal, Kate. That don't come at all natural. "
249,"KATE: But Doc, it ain't safe for you here in Tombstone. "
250,HOLLIDAY: The day I can't walk down Main Street in any city in the West
251,"on account it ain't safe, then I'll be dead. "
252,KATE: Doc! 
253,HOLLIDAY: I'll be dead. 
254,KATE: Doc Holliday!
255,
256,[Main Street]
257,
258," HOLLIDAY: Kate Fisher, are you gonna be my lady"
259,wife? 
260,"KATE: Of course I am, Doc. "
261,MASTERSON: Holliday! 
262,(Holliday wanders down the road to meet the approaching figure.) 
263,"HOLLIDAY: Why, good afternoon, Mister Masterson. Good afternoon,"
264,Sheriff. I reckon you must be come to meet the stage crew. 
265,"MASTERSON: Never mind what I'm doing, Holliday. Just you stay out of"
266,"trouble, that's all. I won't be givin' you no second warnin. "
267,"HOLLIDAY: Why it's like I was sayin' to you, Sheriff. I aim to be a"
268,respectable citizen now and you know I always run a clean game. 
269,"MASTERSON: Here on in, you ain't runnin' no game at all. Stay out of"
270,"saloons, Holliday, and stay away from the poker table. "
271,"HOLLIDAY: Then I bid you good afternoon, Sheriff, and I hope I shall be"
272,having the pleasure of attending you shortly in my dental saloon. Are
273,you accompanying me Miss Kathleen? 
274,(The Sheriff is left standing and scratching his chin. He looks round
275,"as Wyatt Earp appears with the Doctor, Steven and Dodo.) "
276,"MASTERSON: So, you finally got back. "
277,"WYATT: Howdy, Bat. Everythin' quiet in town? "
278,MASTERSON: Everything excepting that rattlesnake friend of yours
279,"Holliday blew in this mornin'. Who're your friends, Wyatt? "
280,"WYATT: Well I, er "
281,"DOCTOR: Oh, quite, quite so. Allow me, sir, to introduce Miss Dodo"
282,"Dupont, wizard of the ivory keys, and er Steven Regret, tenor. And"
283,"lastly sir, your humble servant Doctor Caligari. "
284,MASTERSON: Doctor Who? 
285,"DOCTOR: Yes, quite right. I've just been satisfying the Sheriff here"
286,"that we are a humble troupe of travelling players. Unfortunately, sir,"
287,at the moment between engagements. 
288,MASTERSON: Well if I was you I'd
289,keep a-travellin'. There ain't no theatre in Tombstone. 
290,"DOCTOR: Oh, is that so? Oh, well, that's no matter, no. You see my"
291,"prime purpose for visiting your city, sir, was to avail myself the"
292,services of a dentist. 
293,WYATT: A dentist? 
294,DOCTOR: Yes. 
295,"WYATT: Well, then, Doc Holliday's your man. "
296,"WYATT: Where is the Doc,"
297,Bat? 
298,MASTERSON: Opened his-self a surgery right along the Street. Walk
299,"thatta way, friend. You can't miss it. "
300,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm vastly obliged to you, Sheriff. Come, fellow thespians!"
301,"No doubt I shall be very glad to see you, meet you later on, Mister,"
302,Mister Werp. 
303,"WYATT: Well, Bat, with the Clantons and Holliday in town you'n me's"
304,"headed for a load of trouble, boy. "
305,MASTERSON: I reckon so. 
306,"BALLAD: On your way then, you lawmen, "
307,"The time will be soon, "
308,When there's blood upon the sawdust 
309,In the Last Chance Saloon. 
310,"(The Doctor, Steven and Dodo reach Holliday's shop, where a large"
311,hardwood molar hangs ostentatiously over the door.) 
312,STEVEN: Look I don't know why you wanted to say it in the first place.
313,Steven Regret? What kind of a name's that for a singer anyway? 
314,"DOCTOR: Oh, my dear young man, can't you sing a little? "
315,"STEVEN: Well yes, a little, but why say it at all? "
316,"DOCTOR: Well, I had to find some sort of suitable cover. After all, you"
317,can't walk into the middle of a Western town and say that you've come
318,"from outer space. Good gracious me, we'd all be arrested on a vagrancy"
319,charge. 
320,"STEVEN: And what about our little wizard of the keys? Miss Dupont, can"
321,you play? 
322,DODO: I'll have a bash. 
323,"DOCTOR: There will be no necessity to have a bash, because tomorrow"
324,morning we're going to leave Tombstone and we should be back in the
325,"Tardis in for lunch. You know, I don't think that that is a very subtle"
326,"form of advertising, do you? Yes, come to think of it, my dear, you"
327,"know I think my toothache's better. Yes, I don't think it's going to be"
328,at all necessary 
329,"STEVEN: Come on, Doctor. Straight into the surgery. I'll go to the"
330,hotel and book the rooms. 
331,"DODO: Please, Doctor. You'll feel so much better afterwards. "
332,"DOCTOR: Oh, I only wish I shared your confidence, my dear. However, I"
333,suppose I'll meet you both back in the hotel lounge. Oh! There it goes
334,again. 
335,STEVEN: The hotel lounge? Where does he think we are? What's so funny? 
336,"DODO: I was just thinking, I hope he's not expecting an injection! "
337,
338,[Dentist's office]
339,
340," (Holliday's shop appears deserted, but is at least"
341,clean and tidy. Yet the Doctor wanders around the primitive operating
342,chair and eyes the basic equipment in dismay. He's about to leave but
343,winces as his troublesome tooth throbs once more. At the sound of
344,"voices from the back room, the time traveller opens the connecting door"
345,"to find a young woman sitting on the dentist's lap, the two engaged in"
346,a passionate embrace and obviously not expecting visitors.) 
347,KATE: I gotta get me that 
348,"DOCTOR: I, er, forgive me, sir. I, er, I should have knocked. "
349,HOLLIDAY: What's your business? 
350,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, er, the fact is I, er, I, have a toothache. "
351,"KATE: Ha ha! Well, glory be. "
352,HOLLIDAY: What d'ya know? 
353,KATE: D'you know you're our very first customer? 
354,HOLLIDAY: Yeah! 
355,"DOCTOR: Oh, I see. Well, under the circumstances I think perhaps, er,"
356,"yes, excuse me. "
357,"HOLLIDAY: Now, now, now, now, now, stranger. Just you sit right down in"
358,that chair. 
359,"KATE: Right along here, honey. "
360,"DOCTOR: Well, as a matter of fact, my dear sir "
361,"HOLLIDAY: Yeah, and as a matter of fact it don't do to delay dental"
362,"treatment. Down you go. That's the philosophy of toothache. Now, you go"
363,"in the back room, Kate. "
364,"KATE: Oh, can't I watch? "
365,HOLLIDAY: Now you know you can't stand the sight of blood. 
366,"KATE: Oh, okay. But I'll be thinkin' of ya. "
367,"HOLLIDAY: She's a kind of a sensitive girl. Well now, what seems to be"
368,"your trouble, sir? "
369,"DOCTOR: Well, I think it's at the back here somewhere. "
370,"HOLLIDAY: Let me look. Oh yeah, I see. Well now, if you'll just hold"
371,"real still, I'll er "
372,"DOCTOR: Oh, just a minute, please. Haven't you any anaesthetic? "
373,HOLLIDAY: What? 
374,"DOCTOR: Well er, something to sort of dull the pain, man. "
375,HOLLIDAY: Well I could give you a rap on the cranium with this six
376,shooter. 
377,"DOCTOR: Good gracious, certainly not! "
378,HOLLIDAY: You're welcome to a slug o' rattlesnake oil! 
379,"DOCTOR: Oh, my dear man, I never touch alcohol. "
380,"HOLLIDAY: Well, I do. "
381,"DOCTOR: Well, I must say, this is most unprofessional. I do hope you"
382,know what you're doing. 
383,"HOLLIDAY: I never tolerated any complaints yet, in my whole life. Now"
384,"then, you just open wide. "
385,(Holliday reaches in to the Doctor's mouth with a large pair of
386,forceps.) 
387,"BALLAD: It's your last chance of boozing, "
388,Where there's no-one to mind. 
389,It's your last chance of losing 
390,And the first place you'll find.
391,
392, [Last Chance Saloon]
393,
394," CHARLIE: Sorry it's kinda quiet in here tonight,"
395,"gentlemen. We, er, do reckon to have a singer only she's just stepped"
396,out a while down the 
397,"BILLY: Maybe it's too quiet for you, barman? Like us to liven it up a"
398,"little for ya? How about a little fancy shootin', huh? "
399,CHARLIE: I don't want any trouble. 
400,"BILLY: No trouble at all, friend. "
401,"(Billy takes aim at a row of bottles behind the counter, and fires.) "
402,"IKE: You gone clean out of your mind, boy? That ain't no way to behave."
403,Siddown. 
404,(Steven and Dodo enter.) 
405,"IKE: Oh, we got company. "
406,"PHINEAS: Well, lookie here, if it isn't Calamity Jane and Sam Bass. "
407,(They head for the bar. There's no sign of the barman. Steven rings a
408,small bell on the counter and Charlie's head pokes up from where he'd
409,been cowering under the counter.) 
410,"CHARLIE: What'll it be, stranger? "
411,"STEVEN: Oh, nothing to drink, thanks. We just want to book three rooms."
412,
413,CHARLIE: Three? For the two of you? 
414,"STEVEN: Oh, no, we got a friend joinin' us later. "
415,"CHARLIE: Oh, well, I'll have to ask you to sign the book here. "
416,STEVEN: Sure. 
417,CHARLIE: Just your names and occupations. 
418,(He looks on with interest as Steven writes.) 
419,"CHARLIE: Say, are you really a piano player lady? "
420,DODO: You're darn tootin' I am. 
421,"CHARLIE: And a singer too. Well, I'll be "
422,"STEVEN: Why, what's the matter? "
423,"CHARLIE: Well nothin' in the wide world, friend. I just might be able"
424,to offer you a job is all. I got no pianist on account he was shot last
425,"week, and I do have a singer, but she's always out someplace."
426,Understand? 
427,DODO: I think so. 
428,"STEVEN: Yeah, well, it's very kind of you, but we gotta leave town in"
429,the mornin'. 
430,"CHARLIE: Oh. Well, let me know if you change your mind. First floor,"
431,"three, six and seven. "
432,STEVEN: Why thanks. Come on Dodo. 
433,"DODO: Ah, but Steven "

435,anything happened to you. 
436,HARPER: You all hear what I heard? 
437,"DODO: Ah well. Hey, what about his key? "
438,"STEVEN: Oh, that's a point, yes. Leave it downstairs for him, okay? "
439,(The cowboys are suddenly taking an interest. Steven heads upstairs
440,while Dodo returns to the bar.) 
441,DODO: Give this to our friend the Doctor with my compliments.

448,BILLY: Steven Regret. Now any of you boys ever see a singer carry six

450,PHINEAS: So Holliday has got hisself a partner! 
451,"IKE: Harper, are you sure Holliday don't know we're lookin' for him? "
452,HARPER: How could he? I ain't spread it about. 
453,"IKE: I dunno, but when he comes to collect his key I'll sure have me an"

456,PHINEAS: What'll I say?

458,PHINEAS: You're the boss.

466,of my sight. 
467,HOLLIDAY: Yeah. 
468,DOCTOR: What do I owe you?

480,HARPER: Holliday! 
481,"DOCTOR: Holiday? Yes, I suppose so. Yes, you could call it that. "

483,"DOCTOR: Oh, well, I'm very glad to know you Mister Harper. Yes, I"
484,suppose you've brought a message from my friends. 
485,"HARPER: Well, a kind of a message, Doc. The boys are waitin' for you at"
486,the saloon. They'd sure like to buy you a drink. 
487,"DOCTOR: Oh, well, that's very sociable of them, but unfortunately I"
488,don't touch alcohol. 
489,"HARPER: That's not what I heard, Doc, but we'll play it your way. "
490,(Holliday and Kate are listening from the back room.)

493,(Seth leaves.) 
494,"KATE: Now, Doc. "
495,"HOLLIDAY: Nah, nah, nah, nah. "
496,"DOCTOR: That's a very charming man, that man Mister Harper. Did you"
497,hear what he said? 
498,"HOLLIDAY: Yeah, that's just Western hospitality, you know. But if"
499,"you'll forgive my saying so, you ain't dressed right for a party. "
500,"DOCTOR: Oh, my dear man, I fail to see that my clothes have "
501,"HOLLIDAY: Ah now, it ain't exactly your clothes. "
502,"DOCTOR: Well, what is it then? "
503,HOLLIDAY: You ain't wearin' a gun.

505,HOLLIDAY: Now you can borrow mine. 
506,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. "
507,"HOLLIDAY: Now, come along here. You just stand up here. Now you put the"

509,DOCTOR: I insist. 
510,"HOLLIDAY: Now my gun here has my name printed on it, from way down"
511,"Alabama, where my father was a Colonel in the army. So you can return"
512,"that to me when you leave Tombstone, which no doubt you will. Now,"
513,there you are sir.

522,"DOCTOR: Thank you, thank you. I don't know how I shall ever repay you. "
523,"HOLLIDAY: You'll find a way to repay me. Goodbye, and good luck. "
524,DOCTOR: What? 
525,HOLLIDAY: Goodbye and good luck. 
526,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, indeed, yes. thank you. And the same to you and many"

687,leave it in the hands of the right people. 
688,IKE: And the right people happen be your friend Wyatt Earp?

700,DOCTOR: But I am not the Doc. The man you're looking for is the local
701,"dentist. Yes! He has a little shop here, along the street. "
702,HARPER: It seems to me that's where I found you. 
703,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I can explain that. You see "
704,HARPER: And your gun's got his brand on it.

713,PHINEAS: One word out of your friend Regret here and he gets his. 
714,"KATE: Aw for Pete's sake, Doc, tell 'em you're Holliday! You can take"
715,on all four of 'em any time. 
716,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sorry, gentleman, but this is Holliday's young"
717,"girlfriend, and she's only lying to protect him. Now, as I've already"
718,told you about this gun. 
719,(Seth's revolver is shot from his hand and he clutches his wrist in
720,pain. Nobody is more surprised than the Doctor who was merely waving
721,the gun by way of explanation. But Kate is quick to take advantage of

723,"KATE: Okay, don't try it, fellas. Nice shooting, Doc, but ya should"
724,have got him between the eyes.

728,KATE: Kill the next one that moves.

730,"you heard. Steven, get their guns! "

744,"IKE: You won't get away with this, Holliday! "
745,"DOCTOR: I keep telling you I'm not Holliday. Well, what do we do now? "
746,"KATE: Well, Doc, I reckon that's up to you now. "
747,"HARPER: You should have killed me when you had the chance, Doc, because"
748,you're gonna pay for this.

762,MASTERSON: Wyatt and I handle that kind of explaining around here. Just
763,"easy down, everybody. You too, Kate. "
764,WYATT: Now who did what? 
765,GANG: Holliday did it! 
766,HARPER: We was just having ourselves a friendly discussion. 
767,IKE: Before we could say a word he had us lined up here like a row 
768,"PHINEAS: Yeah, he shot us all down in cold blood. "
769,"STEVEN: Don't you listen to 'em, Marshall. I saw the whole thing, and"
770,it was these guys.

774,Doc Holliday's. 
775,"WYATT: Oh, be quiet, Bat. I reckon I can figure clear enough what must"
776,"have happened. I'm sorry, friend, I'm gonna have to take you in. You're"
777,"under arrest, pop. "
778,DOCTOR: Under arrest? And don't you call me pop. You know very well who
779,"I am, sir! "

784,need.

786,"MASTERSON: All I hope is you know what you're doin', Wyatt. "
787,"WYATT: Oh, I reckon I do. Well, goodnight sinners. I'm sorry your stay"
788,"in our fair, law abidin' city has been so, er, rudely disturbed. "
789,"PHINEAS: Well, if that don't beat all. "
790,IKE: That figures. He couldn't take us in until he'd got the Doc out of
791,trouble like always.

806,KATE: What's she doin here? 
807,"HOLLIDAY: Ah, she saw me fire the gun. "
808,"KATE: Yeah, I guessed that was you. That's why I come a lookin'. You"
809,shoulda killed the little rat. 
810,"HOLLIDAY: That thought did occur to me, but I reckoned that in the"
811,ensuing fracas you might get hurt as well as the old guy. 
812,"KATE: Sure. Real soft-hearted, ain't ya? "
813,"DODO: Look, which old guy are you talking about? "
814,"KATE: Oh, a real nice old guy, lady. He came in to get a tooth fixed. "
815,DODO: That must have been the Doctor. What happened to him? 
816,HOLLIDAY: Wyatt Earp's arrested him. 
817,DODO: Arrested? 
818,HOLLIDAY: Now why would Wyatt do a thing like that? 
819,"KATE: Because Wyatt let them go on thinkin' the old guy was you, that's"
820,why. 
821,"HOLLIDAY: Oh, yeah. "
822,DODO: I must go to the Doctor. You've got to let me out of here. 
823,HOLLIDAY: If he's in the hands of Wyatt Earp he could not be safer. Now

831,"DOCTOR: I have already told you, my dear Sheriff. He lent it to me. "
832,MASTERSON: And why would Holliday do a fool thing like that? 
833,WYATT: Because he knew the Clantons was a-laying for him. 
834,"DOCTOR: Yes, a most unscrupulous man. "
835,"WYATT: Yeah, I think I'll go find him. "
836,"DOCTOR: Ah, but I insist on coming with you. "
837,"WYATT: Now you'll stay right where you are. Why, you've got four of the"
838,meanest characters in the territory believing you're Doc Holliday.

857,PHINEAS: All you gotta do is gun down Earp and Bat Masterson. You all
858,set to try that? 
859,"STEVEN: No, of course not, but. Well, I know if I can get him out of"
860,jail I can prove who he really is. 
861,"IKE: Now wouldn't that be somethin'. Boys, what d'ya say we give Mister"

878,"HOLLIDAY: I'm thirsty. Kate, take a look down in the bar. See if we've"
879,still got company. 
880,"KATE: Now, Doc. "
881,"HOLLIDAY: Take a look, I say! "
882,(Kate looks out.) 
883,"HOLLIDAY: I'm sorry to speak sharp, Missy, but I'm gettin' to feel"
884,almost as caged up here as you are. 
885,"KATE: They're still there, still drinkin'. "
886,"HOLLIDAY: Oh well, I think maybe I'll take a little walk. "
887,"KATE: Oh now Doc, you promised there'd be no more trouble. "
888,"HOLLIDAY: Now you wouldn't want me to die of thirst, would you? "
889,"KATE: Oh well now, if that's all that's troublin' you. You left a"
890,bottle back in your office. Why don't ya just crawl back there and get
891,it? 
892,"HOLLIDAY: Now that's all a man needs. A real gentle, understandin'"
893,woman. I'll be back just as soon as you've finished breaking up my
894,character. 
895,(Holliday leaves.)

904,"WYATT: Right behind you, Doc. "
905,(Holliday spins round.) 
906,"HOLLIDAY: Well that ain't friendly, Wyatt. That ain't friendly at all. "
907,WYATT: Maybe not. I can't say as how I feel particular well disposed
908,towards you right now. 
909,(Earp reaches into Holliday's breast pocket and fumbles for the
910,Derringer.) 
911,HOLLIDAY: You're gettin' clumsy. Do you mind if I turn this lamp up a
912,"little? Make sure you haven't got a whole posse with you? Well now,"
913,what do you want? 
914,WYATT: Only thing I want from you Doc is to get outta town. 
915,HOLLIDAY: Now where did I put that whiskey? Why the hell should I get
916,outta town? I ain't done nothing agin' the law. 
917,"WYATT: Not yet, you ain't. But when the Clantons finally wise up, why,"
918,"there's gonna be shootin', Doc. And, I can't keep that old guy locked"
919,"up in jail forever, you know. "
920,"HOLLIDAY: Er, that's my dentist's chair. That's dangerous, Wyatt. How"
921,long can you keep him then? 
922,"WYATT: Well, I'll release him as soon as I've told 'em the truth about"
923,"you. Tomorrow morning. Now, you can ride out tonight and get yerself a"
924,head-start. 
925,HOLLIDAY: But I only just hit town. I only just set up this business. 
926,"WYATT: Well, it'll be here when you get back. I mean, don't worry. This"
927,is just till this thing blows over. 
928,HOLLIDAY: Would you mind tellin' me what this is all about? 
929,WYATT: Yeah. Old Pa Clanton and his boys are running the biggest
930,rustling operation this territory's ever seen. Pretty soon they'll be
931,takin' over the whole of Tombstone unless something's done to stop 'em.
932,
933,"HOLLIDAY: Well, why don't you stop 'em then? "
934,WYATT: Well Bat 'n me can't handle it alone. We'll stop 'em soon as my
935,brothers get here. 
936,"HOLLIDAY: Oh, looks like you could use an extra hand. "
937,"WYATT: Well, later maybe. But in the meantime Doc, just ride out. "
938,HOLLIDAY: Wyatt. Have you been drinking my whiskey? 
939,(Doc holds up the half empty bottle and Wyatt swaps it for the
940,Derringer.)

945, [Last Chance Saloon]:
946,
947," IKE: So this is the way we'll play it, Regret. You"
948,take this gun over to the jailhouse and slip it through the cell window
949,to Holliday. 
950,"BILLY: And he says, 'open the door or I'll shoot.' "
951,STEVEN: Ah-ha. And where do you guys come in? 
952,"IKE: Well, we wait outside the jailhouse in case anything goes wrong. "
953,HARPER: Yeah. 
954,"PHINEAS: Yeah, so's we can prevent a mis C C Miscarriage of justice. "
955,BILLY: To welcome him back to society. 
956,STEVEN: Oh. Not to gun him down? 
957,IKE: Why would we do a thing like that? You say he ain't Holliday.
958,"Okay, he's got nothin' to fear. What do ya say? "
959,STEVEN: It sounds like a pretty foolproof idea. 
960,"HARPER: Well, it sure is because you know come mornin' they're gonna"
961,ship him outta there. 
962,"IKE: Yeah, up to the County jail. "
963,STEVEN: And what happens after I give him this? 
964,"PHINEAS: You come back here, and then we take over. "
965,HARPER: We take over. 
966,IKE: Yeah. 
967,"STEVEN: Yeah, I got the picture. Okay, I'll see ya in twenty minutes. "
968,"IKE: Okay, right. "
969,HARPER: There's one born every minute! 
970,"IKE: Hold it boys. I don't think he believed us. Phin', you follow him"
971,and make certain him and his friend Holiday don't run away. 
972,PHINEAS: Okay. 
973,"IKE: And Billy, you get the rope. "

986,DODO: But he's an outlaw.

989,"He's a real gentleman. Just been a mite unlucky, is all. "
990,DODO: In what way? 
991,"KATE: Oh, was on the run, leastways till he met up with Wyatt Earp."
992,Since then he's usually managed to keep right side of the law. That's
993,why for the first time I guess he's gonna settle down. 
994,"HOLLIDAY: Kate, seems you and I have to leave town before mornin', so"
995,go get packed. 
996,"KATE: Oh, but Doc, why? "
997,"HOLLIDAY: Wyatt Earp is gunnin' for me, and you know that in my whole"

1018,I've brought you this. 
1019,DOCTOR: What on Earth for? 
1020,STEVEN: Use it to bluff your way out. The Clanton gang still think that
1021,you're Doc Holliday. I'll be waiting for you outside. We must get back
1022,to the Tardis. 
1023,"DOCTOR: Yes, but my dear boy, I "
1024,"STEVEN: Look, there's not time to argue, Doctor. We've only got ten"

1030,"DOCTOR: Ten minutes. Mister Werp? Oh, er, Mister Werp. I say, can you"
1031,do that? 
1032,WYATT: Nope. And I wouldn't try it if I were you. 
1033,"DOCTOR: I have no intention of trying anything, only people keep giving"
1034,"me guns and do I wish they wouldn't. I wonder, would you mind looking"
1035,after it for me? 
1036,"WYATT: My pleasure. And, er, who gave it to you? "
1037,"DOCTOR: Oh er, that young friend of mine, you know, Steven. A rather"
1038,impetuous sort of lad. He said to meet him outside in ten minutes time.
1039,
1040,WYATT: Oh did he? Well I must go and have a word with him.

1064,"STEVEN: Come on, now, what's the idea? "
1065,"IKE: Our idea is, friend, that if Holliday don't bust out of jail we"

1983,about this man Mister Werp? Supposing he gets killed? Who is going to
1984,uphold law and order in this territory? Why they couldn't let Masterson

1986,end of it let the Clantons get a fair trial. 
1987,"MASTERSON: Proud to hear you say so, Doctor. If'n you feel that way"
1988,there's something you can do. I've tried all I know to talk Wyatt out
1989,of this and he won't listen. I'm asking you to go talk to the Clantons.
1990,Seems like that's our only chance. 
1991,"DOCTOR: Me? But my dear Sheriff, I should have thought you were the one"
1992,to convince

1994,"go to 'em wearing your badge, say you'll guarantee them a fair trial,"

1999,"DOCTOR: Yes, quite so, my dear. That thought had passed through my"

2079,"MASTERSON: Wyatt, are you sure I can't stop ya? "
2080,WYATT: Nope. 
2081,"MASTERSON: Okay. So, good luck. "
2082,"WYATT: Ready, Doc? "
2083,"HOLLIDAY: Oh, ready as I will be. Why these here get-togethers have to"
2084,be held at sun-up I never will know. It ain't civilised. 
2085,"WYATT: Now just where're you gonna make your play from, Doc? "
2086,"HOLLIDAY: Well, it's like I said, Wyatt. I'll be strollin' along real"
2087,easy behind you on the shady side of the street. Okay? 
2088,WYATT: Okay. 
2089,(Wyatt leads Virgil out. Holliday remains behind and lifts his hat to
2090,Masterson before he too leaves.)

2092, [OK Corral]
2093,
2094, BALLAD: It's the OK Corral 
2095,"Boys of gun fighting fame, "
2096,"Where the Earps and the Clantons, "
2097,They played out their game. 
2098,"IKE: Here they come, boys. "
2099,(The Earps appear at the corral entrance.) 
2100,IKE: Now! 
2101,(The Clantons open fire but the Earps stand their ground. 
2102,IKE: Scatter! 
2103,"(The brothers split up and dive for cover, shooting as they go. As the"
2104,Earps come into range they start to return fire.) 
2105,WYATT: Take the side. 
2106,(Doc Holliday is advancing slowly along the side of the street unaware
2107,that Ringo is just a few yards behind him.) 
2108,"DODO: Doc, look out! "
2109,"(Holliday spins round at Dodo's warning, but Ringo grabs the girl and"
2110,smiles broadly at his rival.) 
2111,"RINGO: Well, if it ain't Doc Holliday. Who invited you, Doc? "
2112,"HOLLIDAY: You did, Ringo. It seemed kinda seemly to show up. "
2113,"RINGO: Throw down your gun, or the girl gets it. "
2114,"(Doc throws his revolver aside and it skims across the sidewalk, coming"
2115,"to rest in the road. Ringo's eyes follow it, and continuing to hold"
2116,"Dodo tightly as a shield, he moves to pick it up. But as the gunman"
2117,"stoops, Dodo catches him off balance and shoves him hard. He slips,"
2118,landing on his back in the dirt. Dodo runs for shelter as Doc calmly
2119,takes out his Derringer and shoots.) 
2120,HOLLIDAY: I'm sorry Johnny. 
2121,(The Clantons and the Earps continue to trade bullets as Holliday
2122,stands over the dying Ringo.) 
2123,"HOLLIDAY: I thought you'd do better than that, Mister Ringo. "
2124,"RINGO: I will, next time. "
2125,"(Johnny lies still, and Doc retrieves his gun before turning to Dodo.) "
2126,"HOLLIDAY: Ah now Missy, you sure do perplex me. Go on now, you get the"
2127,hell outta here. 
2128,"DODO: I'm sorry, Doc. I was only trying to help. "
2129,"HOLLIDAY: You try to help me any more, you'll be the death of me. Go"
2130,on! 
2131,(Holliday finds Wyatt Earp shooting from behind a barrel.) 
2132,HOLLIDAY: Ringo was here. 
2133,WYATT: And? 
2134,HOLLIDAY: He ain't no more. 
2135,(Billy Clanton is firing from beneath a wagon.) 
2136,BILLY: Phin! I'm gonna get Doc Holliday! 
2137,"(Under cover of a volley of shots from Ike, Billy crawls forward to"
2138,"take new sanctuary under the porch of a building, from where he"
2139,"continues to fire on Holliday's position. But he's edgy, and his"
2140,"bullets go wide. Doc stands and takes careful aim. Blam, blam, blam."
2141,Billy looks up in surprise and pain before collapsing. He struggles to
2142,"sit up, unable to grip his gun properly. Doc steps forward and looks"
2143,Billy straight in the eye before firing a last shot. Billy's gun
2144,discharges harmlessly into the ground as he dies. Phineas looks on
2145,"appalled, then breaks cover and runs around the back of the wagon,"
2146,emerging at the other end in plain sight of Virgil Earp. His shirt
2147,"stained crimson, Phineas staggers against the wagon, clutching at a"
2148,wheel for support before finally sinking under a barrage of shots from
2149,"the Earps. The last Clanton standing, Ike runs up some stairs and takes"
2150,aim at Holliday as he peers around the corner. He pulls the trigger but
2151,"the chamber is empty and the hammer clicks harmlessly. Doc fires, then"
2152,Wyatt and Virgil. Ike tumbles over the handrail and bites the dust.) 
2153,BALLAD: They paid their sins 
2154,And they lost on the draw. 
2155,For the Earps they was faster 
2156,And they was the law. 
2157,So beware all you cowboys 
2158,Who's yearning to sin. 
2159,If the Earps is the lawmen 
2160,You ain't gonna win.
2161,
2162, [Livery stable]
2163,
2164,"(Sometime later, the Doctor leads Steven and Dodo,"
2165,"along with Doc Holliday and Kate, back to where they left the Tardis.) "
2166,"DOCTOR: Why on Earth you want to leave Tombstone, I can't imagine. All"
2167,the Clantons are dead. Ringo is dead. 
2168,HOLLIDAY: Masterson ain't. 
2169,"STEVEN: Yes, but surely Wyatt Earp "
2170,"HOLLIDAY: Wyatt Earp is no longer a lawman. Besides, he has killed two"
2171,Clantons. 
2172,"DODO: Even so, he'd never let a friend down. "
2173,HOLLIDAY: Neither would Masterson. 
2174,"KATE: Show 'em, Doc. "
2175,(Holliday unrolls a wanted poster showing his picture and the offer of
2176,"a 2,000 dollar reward.) "
2177,HOLLIDAY: Ain't nothin' Masterson wouldn't do to oblige a friend. 
2178,KATE: Ain't it always the same? 
2179,HOLLIDAY: Always the same. 
2180,DOCTOR: It's a very good likeness. 
2181,HOLLIDAY: It's yours. 
2182,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
2183,"HOLLIDAY: Goodbye to you all. Come along, Kate. "
2184,"(Arm in arm, Doc and Kate leave the stable.) "
2185,"DOCTOR: It's a terrible, terrible injustice. You know I'm very tempted"
2186,to 
2187,DODO: Listen! 
2188,BALLAD: So fill up your glasses 
2189,"And join in the song, "
2190,The law's right behind you 
2191,And it won't take long. 
2192,"DOCTOR: Oh, my dear Dodo, my dear Dodo. You know you're fast becoming a"
2193,prey to every
2194,clich�-ridden convention in the American West. And it's high time we
2195,"left. Now, come along. "
2196,STEVEN: Thank goodness for that. 
2197,DOCTOR: Come along now. 
2198,"DODO: Oh, but Doctor. "
2199,DOCTOR: I don't want to discuss it any further. In you go. Come along! 
2200,(The Doctor drops the wanted poster in the hay then goes into the
2201,Tardis after his companions.)
2202,
2203,[Tardis]
2204,
2205," (The time machine has landed once more, and the"
2206,scanner shows the image of a rocky ravine.) 
2207,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think I can say that I know just exactly where we are. "
2208,"DODO: Past, present or future? "
2209,DOCTOR: In the future. Very much in the future. We've now reached the
2210,"distant horizon of an age, an age of peace and prosperity. Now, I'm"
2211,going to be off. 
2212,(They all move away from the scanner just as a primitive looking figure
2213,wearing animal skins and carrying a club comes into view.)
