23,"(Both the Doctor and that annoying, loud woman,"
24,"Donna Noble, walk along different streets to the same glass fronted"
25,building. She goes into the main reception whilst he sonics his way in
26,through a rear fire escape.) 
27,"RECEPTIONIST : Good morning, Adipose Industries. "
28,(Donna shows an ID to the guard at the lifts.) 
29,"DONNA: Donna Noble, Health and Safety."

34,passes.)

38,
39,(A woman is giving a presentation to an audience of
40,several dozen.) 
41,"FOSTER: Adipose Industries, the twenty first century way to lose"
42,"weight. No exercise, no diet, no pain. Just lifelong freedom from fat."
43,The Holy Grail of the modern age. And here it is. You just take one
44,"capsule. One capsule, once a day for three weeks, and the fat, as they"
45,say. 
46,(The film takes over.) 
47,NARRATOR : The fat just walks away. 
48,(A woman in the audience speaks.) 
49,"PENNY: Excuse me, Miss Foster. If I could? I'm Penny Carter, science"
50,correspondent for The Observer. There are a thousand diet pills on the
51,"market, a thousand con men stealing people's money. How do we know the"
52,fat isn't going straight into your bank account? 
53,"FOSTER: Oh, Penny, if cynicism burnt up calories, we'd all be as thin"
54,"as rakes. But if you want the science, I can oblige. "
55,(Donna is also in the audience.) 
56,NARRATOR : Adipose Industries. The Adipose capsule is composed of a
57,"synthesised mobilising lipase, bound to a large protein molecule."
58,
59,[Projection room]
60,
61,(This is where the Doctor is watching the
62,presentation.) 
63,COMPUTER: The mobilising lipase breaks up the triglycerides stored in
64,"the adipose cells, which then enter "
65,DOCTOR: Health and Safety. Film department.
66,
67,[Lecture hall]
68,
69,"FOSTER: One hundred percent legal, one hundred"
70,percent effective. 
71,"PENNY: But, can I just ask, how many people have taken the pills to"
72,date? 
73,FOSTER: We've already got one million customers within the Greater
74,"London area alone, but from next week, we start rolling out nationwide."
75,The future starts here. And Britain will be thin.
76,
77,[Call centre]
78,
79,"(Mostly cold calling, by the sound of it.) "
80,PEOPLE: Good morning. I represent Adipose Industries. 
81,(Donna sits down next to a man in a cubicle.) 
82,CRAIG: That's a three week course of pills for a special price of forty
83,five pounds. 
84,"DONNA: (sotto) Donna Noble, Health and Safety. Don't mind me. "
85,(The Doctor finds a young woman.) 
86,CLARE: We deliver within three working days. 
87,"DOCTOR: (sotto) John Smith, Health and Safety. Don't mind me. "
88,"CRAIG: The box comes with 21 days worth of pills, a full information"
89,"pack, and our special free gift, an Adipose Industries pendant. "
90,(Donna looks at the pendant - a gold plated Adpiose pill. The Doctor
91,does the same.) 
92,"CLARE: It's made of eighteen carat gold, and it's yours for free. No,"
93,"we don't give away pens, sorry. No, I can't make an exception, no. "
94,DONNA: I'll just need to keep this for testing. And I just need a list
95,of your customers. Could you print it off? 
96,CRAIG: I suppose so. 
97,DONNA: Where's the printer? 
98,"CRAIG: Just over there, by the plant. "
99,(Donna looks of the cubicle wall.) 
100,"DONNA: Which plant, that plant? "
101,"CRAIG: Yeah, that's the one. "
102,DONNA: Lovely. 
103,"(She sits down, and up pops the Doctor.) "
104,DOCTOR: That's the printer there? 
105,"CLARE: By the plant, yeah. "
106,DOCTOR: Brilliant. 
107,(Down he goes and up comes Donna.) 
108,"DONNA: Does it need a code? Last place I worked, the printer needed a"
109,code. 
110,"CRAIG: No, I can do it from here. "
111,(They swap over.) 
112,DOCTOR: Has it got paper? 
113,"CLARE: Yeah, Jimbo keeps it stocked. "
114,(Miss Foster walks in with two guards.) 
115,"FOSTER: Excuse me, everyone, if I could have your attention. "
116,(The workers stand.) 
117,"FOSTER: On average, you're each selling forty Adipose packs per day."
118,It's not enough. I want one hundred sales per person per day. And if
119,"not, you'll be replaced. Because if anyone's good in trimming the fat,"
120,it's me. Now. Back to it. 
121,(Miss Foster leaves and the workers sit down again.) 
122,"DOCTOR: Anyway, if you could print that off. Thanks. "
123,"DONNA: So if you could just print off that list, I'll get out of your"
124,"way. Lovely. Thanks, then. See you. "
125,(Donna heads for the printer. The Doctor stands then sits again as
126,Clare gives him a piece of paper.) 
127,"DOCTOR: Thanks, then. Oh, what's that? "
128,CLARE: My telephone number. 
129,DOCTOR: What for? 
130,"CLARE: Health and Safety. You be health, I'll be safety. "
131,"DOCTOR: Ah. Ah. But that contravenes er, paragraph five, subsection C."
132,Sorry. 
133,(Donna collects the printouts and leaves. The Doctor walks behind her
134,"to the printer and looks for his copies, then returns to Clare.) "
135,DOCTOR: Me again.

137,[Stacy's home]
138,
139,DONNA: Stacy Campbell? 
140,STACY: Who wants to know? 
141,"DONNA: My name's Donna. I represent Adipose Industries, and you're on"
142,the list of our valued customers.
143,
144,[Roger's home]
145,
146,DOCTOR: Mister Roger Davey? I'm calling on behalf
147,of Adipose Industries. Just need to ask you a few questions.
148,
149,[Stacy's home]
150,
151,STACY: It's been fantastic. I've started the pills
152,"on Thursday. Five days later, I've lost eleven pounds. "
153,DONNA: And no side effects or anything? 
154,"STACY: No, I feel fantastic. It's a new lease of life. Now, what do you"
155,think about these earrings. Do they work? 
156,"DONNA: Yeah, lovely."
157,
158,[Roger's home]
159,
160,ROGER: I've been on the pills for two weeks now.
161,I've lost fourteen kilos. 
162,DOCTOR: That's the same amount every day? 
163,"ROGER: One kilo exactly. You wake up, and it's disappeared overnight."
164,"Well, technically speaking, it's gone by ten past one in the morning. "
165,DOCTOR: What makes you say that? 
166,ROGER: That's when I get woken up. Might as well weigh myself at the
167,same time.
168,
169,[Stacy's home]
170,
171,DONNA: You going on a date? 
172,STACY: I'm doing the opposite. I'm dumping him. I can do better than
173,"him now. Right, I won't be long. If the taxi beeps, give me a shout."
174,
175,[Roger's home]
176,
177,"ROGER: It is driving me mad. Ten minutes past one,"
178,"every night, bang on the dot without fail, the burglar alarm goes off."
179,"I've had experts in, I've had it replaced, I've even phoned Watchdog."
180,"But no, ten past one in the morning, off it goes. "
181,DOCTOR: But with no burglars? 
182,ROGER: Nothing. I've given up looking. 
183,"DOCTOR: Tell me, Roger. Have you got a cat flap? "
184,(That's a yes.) 
185,ROGER: It was here when I bought the house. I've never bothered with
186,"it, really. I'm not a cat person. "
187,"DOCTOR: No, I've met cat people. You're nothing like them. "
188,"ROGER: It's that what it is, though? Cats getting inside the house? "
189,"DOCTOR: Well, thing about cat flaps is, they don't just let things in,"
190,they let things out as well. 
191,ROGER: Like what? 
192,DOCTOR: The fat just walks away.
193,
194,[Stacy's home]
195,
196,(Stacy is in the bathroom.) 
197,STACY: Won't be long! 
198,"DONNA: Oh, that's all right. "
199,"(Donna takes the Adipose pendant out and examines it, then she twists"
200,it absentmindedly and Stacy's stomach growls. As Donna twiddles with
201,"the gold capsule, Stacey's abdomen moves around.)"
202,
203,[Miss Foster's office]
204,
205,"(An alarm goes off, and her computer screen shows"
206,the location. Miss Foster uses her wrist-watch
207,communicator.) 
208,FOSTER: We have unscheduled parthenogenesis.
209,
210,[Roger's home]
211,
212,"DOCTOR: Well, thanks for your help. Tell you what,"
213,maybe you could lay off the pills for a week or so. 
214,(The Doctor's three lobed gizmo beeps.) 
215,DOCTOR: Oh. Got to go. Sorry.
216,
217,[Miss Foster's office]
218,
219,FOSTER: Send out the collection squad. Bring them
220,home. 
221,(A black van with sirens and lights speeds out of the Adipose
222,Industries car park.)
223,
224,[Stacy's home]
225,
226,(A jelly-baby shaped creature breaks off from
227,Stacy's abdomen and jumps into the bathroom sink.) 
228,DONNA: You all right up there? 
229,STACY: Yeah. 
230,(The little creature looks up at her.)
231,
232,[Miss Foster's office]
233,
234,FOSTER: The Adipose has been witnessed. Activating
235,full parthenogenesis. 
236,(Miss Foster twiddles her own pendant.)
237,
238,[Stacy's bathroom]
239,
240,"(Another creature pops out of Stacy's body, then"
241,gurgles and waves at her.) 
242,STACY: What are you? What are you? 
243,[Stacy's home]
244,
245,(Donna is at the foot of the stairs.) 
246,DONNA: I like what you've done with the hall. Stacy? Are you all right?
247,I wouldn't mind a little visit myself. Everything all right in there? 
248,(She knocks on the bathroom door.) 
249,DONNA: It's only me. Do you mind if I pop to the loo? Stacy? 
250,(Lots of lumps are moving around below Stacy's clothes.) 
251,"STACY: Oh, help me. Oh my God, help me! "
252,"DONNA: What is it, what's wrong? "
253,(Stacy has bolted the door on the inside.) 
254,DONNA: Stacy! 
255,"(Stacy screams then her clothes fall to the floor, and lots of little"
256,"creatures run out. When Donna burst in, she sees the last one on the"
257,window sill. It waves at her and jumps.)
258,
259,[Street]
260,
261,(The Doctor is following the signal on his gizmo.
262,He has to hit it a few times. The van arrives outside Stacy's home as
263,Donna leaves by the back door and goes down the alleyway. The trail of
264,knocked over dustbins tells her which way the creatures have gone. The
265,"men from the van have used butterfly nets to collect the creatures, put"
266,them into containers and then the back of the van. They drive away past
267,"Donna, and nearly knock down the Doctor. He starts chasing it. A taxi"
268,pulls up by Donna.) 
269,DRIVER: Stacy Campbell? 
270,"DONNA: No, she's gone. "
271,DRIVER: Gone where? 
272,DONNA: She's just gone. 
273,"DRIVER: Oh, great. Thanks for nothing. "
274,"(He puts his For Hire sign back on and drives off. In the alleyway,"
275,"mere yards from Donna, the Doctor loses the signal on his gizmo."
276,
277,[Miss Foster's office]
278,
279,(Miss Foster is examining security footage on her
280,computer screen.) 
281,FOSTER: It seems we have a case of industrial espionage. One touch and
282,"the capsule bio-tunes itself to it's owner, but someone must have"
283,"introduced a second raw capsule. Therefore, one of these people is a"
284,"thief. There, oh yes, there she is. Now, what shall we do with her?"
285,
286,[Nobles' home]
287,
288,"(Donna goes inside, and her mother calls out.) "
289,SYLVIA : And what time's this? 
290,DONNA: How old am I? 
291,SYLVIA: Not old enough to use a phone. 
292,"(A little later, Donna is sitting at the kitchen table with a mug of"
293,drink.) 
294,SYLVIA: I thought you were only moving back for a couple of weeks. Look
295,"at you. I mean, you're never gonna find a flat, not while you're on the"
296,"dole. And its no good sitting there, dressed up, looking like you're"
297,job hunting. You've got to do something. It's not like the 1980s. No
298,one's unemployed these days except you. How long did that job with
299,"Health and Safety last? Two days, and then you walk out. I have other"
300,"plans. Well, I've not seen them. And it's no good sitting there"
301,dreaming. No one's
302,going to come along with a magic wand and make your life all better. 
303,DONNA: Where is Granddad? 
304,SYLVIA: Where do you think he is! Up the hill. He's always up the hill.
305,
306,[Allotment]
307,
308,(Granddad is the newspaper seller from Voyage of
309,"the Damned, and he has got a nice set-up in his allotment shed. There"
310,is also a small telescope and a camp stool nearby. Donna walks up with
311,a thermos.) 
312,"WILF: Aye, aye. Here comes trouble. "
313,"DONNA: Permission to board ship, sir? "
314,WILF: Permission granted. Was she nagging you? 
315,DONNA: Big time. Brought you a thermos. 
316,"WILF: Oh, ta. "
317,DONNA: You seen anything? 
318,"WILF: Yeah, I've got Venus, there with an apparent magnitude of minus"
319,"three point five. At least, that's what it says in my little book. "
320,(Donna puts a tarpaulin on the ground next to him.) 
321,"WILF: Here, come and see. Come on. Here you go. Right? "
322,(Donna looks at the bright evening star.) 
323,WILF: That's the only planet in the Solar System named after a woman. 
324,DONNA: Good for her. How far away is that? 
325,"WILF: Oh, its about twenty six million miles. But we'll get there, one"
326,day. In a hundred years time we'll be striding out amongst the stars.
327,Jiggling about with all them aliens. Just you wait. 
328,"DONNA: You really believe in all that stuff, don't you? "
329,WILF: It's all over the place these days. If I wait here long enough. 
330,DONNA: I don't suppose you've seen a little blue box? 
331,WILF: Is that slang for something? 
332,"DONNA: No, I mean it. If you ever see a little blue box flying up there"
333,"in the sky, you shout for me, Gramps. Oh, you just shout. "
334,"WILF: Do you know, I don't understand half the things you say these"
335,days. 
336,DONNA: Nor me. 
337,"WILF: No, fair dos. You've had a funny old time of it lately. There was"
338,"poor old what's his name, Lance, bless him, and that barmy old"
339,Christmas. I wish you'd tell us what really happened. 
340,"DONNA: I know. It's just, the things I've seen, sometimes I think I'm"
341,"going mad. I mean, even tonight I was in a. Doesn't matter. "
342,"WILF: Well, you're not yourself, I'll give you that. You just, you seem"
343,"to be drifting, sweetheart. "
344,DONNA: I'm not drifting. I'm waiting. 
345,WILF: What for? 
346,DONNA: The right man. 
347,WILF: Same old story. A man! 
348,"DONNA: No, I don't mean like that. But, he's real. I've seen him. I've"
349,"met him, just once, and then I let him fly away. "
350,"WILF: Well, there you are. Go and find him. "
351,DONNA: I've tried. He's nowhere. 
352,"WILF: Oi, not like you to give up. Do you know, I remember when you"
353,"were about six years old, your mother said no holiday this year. So off"
354,"you toddled, all on your own and you got on a bus to Strathclyde. Ha!"
355,"We had the police after you and everything. Ha, where's she gone, then."
356,"Where's that girl, hey? "
357,"DONNA: You're right. Because he's still out there, somewhere. And I'll"
358,"find him, Gramps. Even if I have to wait a hundred years, I'll find"
359,him.
360,
361,[Tardis]
362,
363,(The Doctor is examining his version of the pendant
364,through a magnifying glass.) 
365,"DOCTOR: Oh, fascinating. Seems to be a bio-flip digital stitch,"
366,specifically for 
367,(Then he realises he only talking to himself.)
368,
369,[Outside Donna's home]
370,
371,(Sylvia comes out of the house wearing a dressing
372,gown and hair curlers.) 
373,SYLVIA: It's my turn for the car. What you need it for? 
374,DONNA: A quick getaway. 
375,
376,[Call centre]
377,
378,(Donna parks in an alleyway near Adipose
379,"Industries, and leaves. Then the Tardis materialises nearby. They both"
380,enter the building as they did before.)
381,DONNA: Morning. 
382,(The Doctor goes into a storage room and sonics the door locked. Donna
383,settles herself in a cubicle in the ladies.) 
384,FOSTER: Keep an eye out. She'll come back and then she's mine. 
385,(The clock moves on from 9:30 to 6:10. The call staff are leaving and
386,the lights are being turned out.) 
387,CLARE: See you tomorrow. 
388,"(The Doctor comes out of his hiding place. Donna does the same, then"
389,goes back in to answer her phone.) 
390,DONNA: (sotto) Not now. 
391,[Nobles' home]
392,
393,SYLVIA: I need the car. Where are you?
394,
395,[Ladies toilets]
396,
397,DONNA: I can't. I'm busy.
398,
399,[Nobles' home]
400,
401,SYLVIA: Why are you whispering?
402,
403,[Ladies toilets]
404,
405,DONNA: I'm in church. 
406,SYLVIA: What are you doing in church? 
407,DONNA: Praying.
408,
409,[Nobles' home]
410,
411,"SYLVIA: Huh, bit late for that, madam. "
412,WILF: What's she in church for? 
413,"SYLVIA: Hush, you. Go up the hill. But I need the car. I'm going out"
414,with Suzette. She's asked all the Wednesday girls. Apparently she's
415,been on those Adipose pills. She says she looks marvellous.
416,
417,[Ladies toilets]
418,
419,(Miss Foster enters with armed guards.) 
420,"FOSTER: We know you're in here, so why don't you make this nice and"
421,"easy and show yourself? I'm waiting. I warn you, I'm not a patient"
422,"woman. Now, out you come. Right. We'll do it the hard way. Get her. "
423,(The guards kick open the cubicle doors. The fifth one contains Penny
424,the reporter.) 
425,FOSTER: There you are. 
426,"PENNY: I've been through the records, Foster, and all of your results"
427,have been faked. There's something about those pills you're not telling
428,us. 
429,"FOSTER: Oh, I think I'll be conducting this interview, Penny. "
430,"(They leave. Meanwhile, the Doctor comes out of the plant room onto the"
431,roof and gets into the window cleaner's cradle.)
432,
433,[Call centre]
434,
435,PENNY: You've got no right to do this. Let me go!
436,
437,[Miss Foster's office]
438,
439,(The Doctor lowers the cradle to Miss Foster's
440,window. He ducks out of sight when they enter.) 
441,PENNY: This is ridiculous. 
442,FOSTER: Sit there. 
443,PENNY: I'm phoning my editor. 
444,FOSTER: I said sit. 
445,[Outside the window]
446,
447,(The Doctor uses a stethoscope to listen to the
448,conversation.) 
449,PENNY : You can't tie me up. 
450,[Miss Foster's office]
451,
452,PENNY: What sort of a country do you think this is?
453,
454,"FOSTER: Oh, it's a beautifully fat country. And believe me, I've"
455,travelled a long way to find obesity on this scale. 
456,"PENNY: So, come on then, Miss Foster, those pills. What are they? "
457,(Donna has arrived at the secretary's station outside the office.) 
458,"FOSTER: Well, you might just as well have a scoop, since you'll never"
459,see it printed. This (a capsule) is the spark of life. 
460,PENNY: And what's that supposed to mean? 
461,"FOSTER: Officially, the capsule attracts all the fat cells and flushes"
462,"them away. Well, it certainly attracts them. That part's true. But it"
463,binds the fat together and galvanises it to form a body. 
464,"PENNY: What do you mean, a body? "
465,FOSTER: I am surprised you never asked about my name. I chose it well.
466,Foster. As in foster mother. And these are my children. 
467,(She takes a little creature out of a drawer and puts it on the desk.) 
468,PENNY: You're kidding me. What the hell is that? 
469,(Donna and the Doctor both look through the windows.) 
470,FOSTER: Adipose. It's called an Adipose. Made out of living fat. 
471,PENNY: But I don't understand. 
472,FOSTER: From ordinary human people. 
473,(The Doctor and Donna see each other. Their conversation is totally
474,silent.) 
475,DOCTOR: Donna? 
476,DONNA: Doctor? Doctor! 
477,DOCTOR: But what? What? What? 
478,DONNA: Oh my god! 
479,DOCTOR: But how? 
480,DONNA: It's me! 
481,"DOCTOR: Yes, I can see that. "
482,"DONNA: Oh, this is brilliant. "
483,DOCTOR: What the hell are you doing there? 
484,DONNA: I was looking for you. 
485,DOCTOR: What for? 
486,DONNA: I read it on the internet. Weird. Crept along. Heard them
487,talking. Hid. You. 
488,(Then she realises that Miss Foster is staring at her and the Doctor.) 
489,FOSTER: Are we interrupting you?
