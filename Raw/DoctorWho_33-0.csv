27,"DOCTOR: I've got my finger on a button, which is fine, but as soon as I"
28,take my finger off the button the spaceship is going to explode.
29,(Sparks.) 
30,"DOCTOR: Argh. Which is good in one way, because the spaceship in"
31,"question is about to attack the Earth, but bad in another way, because"
32,"I'm on the spaceship and I'm going to get all smithereened. Now, plan."
33,I'm going to send you the coordinates so you can fly the Tardis here
34,"and rescue me. Only three flaws in this plan as far as I can see. One,"
35,"I don't have the coordinates. Two, you can't fly the Tardis. Three, oh"
36,"dear, you're not even there. You left ages ago. Oh, well. I think I"
37,"just wanted a chat before all the smithereens. Merry Christmas, Amelia."

40,to go KaBOOM!)

52,"into the spacesuit storage area by an airlock, then an explosion blows"
53,half of it away. He is hanging on to the end of a frayed cable.) 
54,"DOCTOR: Ah! Come here, spacesuit. Come to Doctor. "
55,(Another explosion blows him and the suit into space.)

65,(It is the late 1930s. A woman is bicycling along
66,when she hears an Argh! and a Whumph! as something hits the ground at
67,"speed. She falls off her bicycle into a hedge, then goes to investigate"
68,the crater in the field nearby. It contains an occupied spacesuit.) 
69,"MADGE: Hello? Hello? Hello, are you all right? "
70,DOCTOR: Ow. 
71,MADGE: Are you hurt? Did you fall? Where did you fall from? 
72,DOCTOR: Helmet. 
73,"MADGE: All right, just just let me. I don't want to hurt you. "
74,"(She raises the solid protective visor, then the transparent one, to"
75,reveal a lot of hair.) 
76,MADGE: Oh. 
77,DOCTOR: I can't see. I'm blind! 
78,"MADGE: Oh no, love, no. I think you've just got your helmet on"
79,backwards. How did you manage that? 
80,DOCTOR: I got dressed in a hurry.

84,(A bespectacled young boy in pajamas is looking
85,through a telescope.) 
86,"MADGE: Cyril, what are you doing awake? "
87,(His older sister is also in her night clothes.) 
88,"LILY: It's the moon's fault, apparently. It's too interesting. "
89,CYRIL: It's astronomy. 
90,LILY: Don't make up words. He's always making up things and breathing. 
91,MADGE: Where's your father? 
92,CYRIL: In the garden. 
93,MADGE: What's he doing in the garden? 
94,CYRIL: Agriculture. 
95,LILY: You're not fooling anyone. 
96,"MADGE: Listen, Cyril. Tell him that I've borrowed Mister Goldsmith's"
97,"car. That I found a spaceman in a field, possibly an angel, but he's"
98,"injured and I can't get his helmet off, so I'm having to take him into"
99,"town to find a police telephone box, all right? "
100,CYRIL: All right. 
101,MADGE: Good boy. 
102,(Madge leaves.) 
103,REG: Was that your mother? Where's she going? 
104,CYRIL: Out.

106,[Town]
107,
108,(There is a police box by the green. Madge stops
109,the car by gently running into a wooden bollard.) 
110,DOCTOR: Ow! Did we just bump into something? 
111,"MADGE: No, no. "
112,DOCTOR: We seemed to bump into quite a lot of things. 
113,"MADGE: Well, a lot of things get in the way. It's hardly my fault. You"
114,need to take that silly thing off. 
115,DOCTOR: Can't. Impact suit. It's still repairing me. 
116,MADGE: Repairing you? 
117,(She helps him out of the car.) 
118,"DOCTOR: Yeah, well, you know, that's the idea. "
119,MADGE: Won't it repair you all back to front? 
120,DOCTOR: No. No. 
121,"MADGE: Well, that's good. Oh, that's a street lamp. "
122,"DOCTOR: Yes, I got that impression. "
123,MADGE: Round this way. Don't you want me to take you to hospital or
124,something? You're welcome to come to our house. 
125,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. I'm fine. I just need to find the, er, the key. "
126,MADGE: Do you want me to do it with a pin? I'm good with a pin. 
127,(She takes out a hair grip.) 
128,"DOCTOR: Multi-dimensional, triple encoded temporal interface. Not"
129,really susceptible to pointy things. 
130,MADGE: Got it. 
131,DOCTOR: Okay. Suddenly the last nine hundred years of time travel seem
132,that bit less secure. Thank you for taking care of me. You didn't have
133,"to, you know. You've been very kind. "
134,"MADGE: Oh, don't be silly. It's Christmas Eve. No one should be alone"
135,at Christmas. 
136,DOCTOR: What did you say your name was? 
137,MADGE: Madge. Madge Arwell. 
138,"DOCTOR: If there's anything that I can do for you, let me know. "
139,MADGE: How? 
140,DOCTOR: I don't know. Make a wish. That usually works. 
141,MADGE: Does it? 
142,"DOCTOR: It did for me. You're here, aren't you? Well, don't wait around"
143,"here. Just off you go home. I'll just go and, and wait inside here. "
144,(He goes inside the police telephone box.) 
145,DOCTOR: Ow! Wrong one. Do you think we could try again?

149,"(Reg is reading his newspaper, the News Chronicle."
150,The head line is War Looms. Madge enters.) 
151,REG: You were a long time. Been taking home strays as usual? 
152,MADGE: Just the one. What have you been reading? Not the war again.
153,"People keep reading about the war, then it will actually happen. And"
154,then where will you be?

161,REG: I don't know. Somewhere over the Channel. 
162,CO-PILOT: What do I tell Anderson? 
163,"REG: Tell him, tell him, tell him we're going home for Christmas. "
164,"CO-PILOT: Yes, sir. "
165,"REG: I'm sorry, my love. "

167,(Madge wakes up and sees the dreaded telegram on
168,her bedside table. Regret to inform you etc night of 20th Dec Deepest

170,pudding.) 
171,CYRIL: When's Father coming back? 
172,"LILY: For Christmas, like he always does. Now, hurry up and think of"
173,something. 
174,CYRIL: But we're going to Uncle Digby's house. Will he be there? 
175,"LILY: He will, won't he, mother? Daddy will be there. "
176,MADGE: Of course he will. 
177,"LILY: See? Now, have you thought of anything? "
178,"CYRIL: Er, yep. "
179,"LILY: Count of three, then. Make a wish. One, two, three! "
180,"(As her children pull the wishbone, Madge makes a wish.)"
181,
182,[Outside Uncle Digby's house]
183,
184,(Christmas Eve outside a massive old house.
185,Probably a Victorian rebuild of something much older.) 
186,CYRIL: Is it haunted? 
187,LILY: Is it draughty? 
188,"MADGE: Oh, this is no good. Where's Mister Cardew? He was supposed to"
189,be here. 
190,(Madge goes to knock on the door.) 
191,CYRIL: Maybe it's haunted by the ghost of Uncle Digby. 
192,LILY: Uncle Digby is still alive. He's in a home in Battersea. 
193,MADGE: Mister Cardew! 
194,CYRIL: But why do we have to come here? 
195,"LILY: Because of the bombing, stupid. "
196,CYRIL: I like the bombing. It's exciting. 
197,"LILY: Will Father be here? Well, he will, won't he? You said he'd meet"
198,us at the house. 
199,MADGE: He'll be here. Of course he will. You don't need to keep asking
200,about it. 
201,(Someone unbolts the door from the inside.) 
202,LILY + CYRIL: Father! 
203,"DOCTOR : Sorry, it's the door. It's developed a fault. "
204,"MADGE: Oh, hello? Mister Cardew? "
205,(One of the double doors is pulled off its hinges.) 
206,"DOCTOR: There we go. Well, come in. In you come. "
207,[Entrance hall]
208,
209,"(Marble floor, lovely staircase up, some"
210,dustsheets.) 
211,"DOCTOR: Mind your step. Now, don't worry. The back door is still,"
212,"broadly speaking, operational. "
213,(The Doctor puts the door back in its hole.) 
214,"DOCTOR: Right then, may I take your cases? "
215,MADGE: Thank you. 
216,LILY: Thank you. 
217,CYRIL: Thank you. 
218,DOCTOR: Lovely. Would you mind carrying them for me? I need to show you
219,round. 
220,"MADGE Oh no, wait! "
221,(The Doctor runs up the stairs.) 
222,MADGE: Who are you? 
223,DOCTOR: I'm the caretaker. 
224,MADGE: But you're not Mister Cardew. 
225,DOCTOR: I agree. 
226,MADGE: I don't understand. Are you the new caretaker? 
227,DOCTOR: Usually called the Doctor. Or the Caretaker or Get Off This
228,"Planet. Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name. Hello,"
229,Madge Arwell. 
230,MADGE: Hello. 
231,"DOCTOR: And Cyril Arwell. And Lily Arwell. Now, come on, come on. Lots"
232,"to see. Whistle stop tour. Take notes, there will be questions."
233,
234,[Small sitting room]
235,
236,DOCTOR: Smaller sitting room. Just chairs. Bit
237,"pointless without a television, so I made some repairs. "
238,(He presses a button by the door and the easy chairs move around on
239,their own.) 
240,DOCTOR: I know. 
241,[Kitchen]
242,
243,"DOCTOR: Kitchen! That's a cooker, probably. And"
244,"these are taps. Hot, cold, lemonade. "
245,CYRIL: Lemonade? 
246,DOCTOR: I know!
247,
248,[Staircase]
249,
250,DOCTOR: Staircase. It seems to have broken down.
251,We'll have to walk up.
252,
253,[Landing]
254,
255,DOCTOR: I sleep up there. Stay away. Beware of
256,panthers. 
257,LILY: Panthers? 
258,DOCTOR: They're terrifying. Have you never seen panthers? Cyril! 
259,[Madge's bedroom]

261,(With a huge canopy over the bed.) 
262,DOCTOR: Mum's bedroom. Grown up. Your basic boring.

264,[Children's room]
265,
266,(More toys than you can play with in a month.) 
267,"DOCTOR: Lily and Cyril's room. I'm going to be honest, masterpiece. The"
268,ultimate bedroom. A sciencey wiencey workbench. A jungle. A maze. A
269,window disguised as a mirror. A mirror disguised as a window. Selection
270,"of torches for midnight feasts and secret reading. Zen garden,"
271,"mysterious cupboard, zone of tranquillity, rubber wall, dream tank,"
272,"exact model of the rest of the house, not quite to scale. Apologies."
273,"Dolls with comical expressions, the Magna Carta, a foot spa, Cluedo, a"
274,yellow fort. 
275,CYRIL: Where are the beds? 
276,"DOCTOR: Well, I couldn't fit everything in. There had to be sacrifices."
277,"Anyway, who needs beds when you've got "
278,(He pulls a lever and down from the ceiling come - ) 
279,DOCTOR: Hammocks! I know. 
280,CYRIL: But how do you get on? 
281,"DOCTOR: Watch and learn, kid. "
282,"(The Doctor takes a run, jumps, and falls right between the two"
283,hammocks.) 
284,MADGE: For God's sake! 
285,DOCTOR: This hammock has developed a fault. 
286,MADGE: Can you please stop talking? Can you please just stop! 
287,DOCTOR: Sorry. 
288,"MADGE: Children, go downstairs. "
289,LILY: Why? 
290,CYRIL: Are we leaving? 
291,MADGE: Yes. No. I don't know. Just please go downstairs! 
292,LILY: You don't need to shout. 
293,(Lily and Cyril leave.) 
294,MADGE: Why are you doing all this? 
295,DOCTOR: I'm just trying to take care of things. I'm the caretaker. 
296,MADGE: That's not what caretakers do. 
297,DOCTOR: Then why are they called caretakers? 
298,MADGE: Their father's dead. 
299,DOCTOR: I'm sorry. 
300,"MADGE: Lily and Cyril's father, my husband, is dead and they don't know"
301,"yet, because if I tell them now, then Christmas will always be what"
302,"took their father away from them, and no one should have to live like"
303,"that. Of course, when the Christmas period is over, I shall. I don't"
304,know why I keep shouting at them. 
305,"DOCTOR: Because every time you see them happy, you remember how sad"
306,"they're going to be, and it breaks your heart. "
307,"LILY : Mother, come and see! "
308,CYRIL: Mother! You've got to see this! 
309,DOCTOR: Because what's the point in them being happy now if they're
310,going to be sad later. 
311,CYRIL : Mother. 
312,"LILY : Mother, are you coming? "
313,"DOCTOR: The answer is, of course, because they are going to be sad"
314,"later. Now, we'd better get downstairs. I think they may have found the"
315,main sitting room. 
316,CYRIL : Mother! 
317,DOCTOR: I repaired it.

319,
320,(A massive Christmas tree with rotating aeroplane
321,section and lots of other cool stuff.) 
322,DOCTOR: I know. 
323,(And a very large box.) 
324,CYRIL: Look at that present. It's for me. 
325,"LILY: No, it says it's for all of us. "
326,CYRIL: I'm the youngest. I get to open it first. 
327,"LILY: Doesn't say who it's from. Mother, who left this here? "
328,(The Doctor disappears.) 
329,MADGE: That man is quite ridiculous. You must stay away from him. 
330,LILY: I like him. 
331,"CYRIL: I like him, too. "
332,"LILY: And it's a nice tree, isn't it. "
333,CYRIL: It's the best tree in the world. 
334,"MADGE: Yes. Yes, I suppose it is. "
335,"CYRIL: Say it, Mother. Go on, please. Say the thing you always say. "
336,MADGE: This Christmas is going to be the best Christmas ever. 
337,(Cyril looks round his mother and sees the Present glowing. It seems to
338,"be whispering, too.)"

341,
342,(Night time. Lily and Cyril are in their hammocks.)
343,
344,"CYRIL: Lily? Lily, can you sleep? Lily! "
345,LILY: Shut up. 
346,CYRIL: What do you think that present is? We could just sneak down and
347,have a look. 
348,LILY: Go to sleep. 
349,(He does. Madge is lying awake clutching the telegram when Lily sneaks
350,out of the room. She hears noises and sees lights from the Doctor's
351,wing of the house and goes to investigate. Then Cyril comes out of the
352,room with a torch.)

356,(The Tardis fits neatly under the eaves. Moonlight
357,is coming in through a heart-shaped hole in the roof and the Doctor is
358,working on a gizmo.) 
359,LILY: You were lying about the panthers. 
360,DOCTOR: Famous last words. 
361,LILY: Why have you got a phone box in your room? 
362,"DOCTOR: It's not a phone box, it's my wardrobe. I've just painted it to"
363,look like a phone box. 
364,"LILY: Well, what are you doing? "
365,DOCTOR: Rewiring. 
366,LILY: Why would you rewire a wardrobe? 
367,DOCTOR: Have you seen the way I dress? 
368,"LILY: Who are you? Really, who are you? "
369,(A small alarm beeps.) 
370,"DOCTOR: Your brother, where is he? "
371,"(Cyril is downstairs, untying the big present. He opens the box and"
372,"light streams out, along with some snowflakes. He crawls inside and"
373,looks out on a snow covered forest. The box is suspended off the
374,ground. He backs out into the main sitting room as Lily looks into
375,their room.) 
376,"LILY: Still in bed, asleep. "
377,"DOCTOR: Okay. Faulty, then. "
378,(Cyril summons up his courage and goes into what is definitely Not
379,Narnia because he didn't get there through the back of a wardrobe. A
380,"nearby tree grows some big glass baubles. He picks one, and it gets"
381,"bigger in his hand. He drops it and it grows again, then begins to"
382,crack. Cyril runs back through the box. The Doctor's alarm beeps
383,again.) 
384,DOCTOR: You're sure he's still in bed? 
385,(Cyril returns to his winter wonderland. Whatever was in the bauble has
386,"hatched and gone, leaving tracks.)"

390,LILY: See? 
391,DOCTOR: Shush. 
392,(The Doctor whips the cover off Cyril's hammock.) 
393,"DOCTOR: Oh, he's good. The old bear and duvet, eh? Classic."
394,
395,[Main sitting room]
396,
397,(They arrive just in time to see Cyril's hand grab
398,his torch and disappear inside the box.) 
399,DOCTOR: Cyril! 
400,LILY: What's happening? I don't 
401,(The Doctor dives into the box.) 
402,LILY: What is that? 
403,"DOCTOR: With me. Quickly, come on."
404,
405,[Not Narnia]

407,(The Doctor helps Lily out the other side.) 
408,"DOCTOR: That's it. In you come. Brr, bit cold. Never mind. Cyril!"
409,Cyril! 
410,(He finds the hatched bauble.) 
411,LILY: Where are we? 
412,"DOCTOR: In a forest, in a box, in a sitting room. Pay attention. He's"
413,about twenty minutes ahead. 
414,LILY: But we just saw him. 
415,DOCTOR: Time moves differently across the dimensional planes. What do
416,they teach you in schools these days? 
417,LILY: But I don't understand where we are. 
418,DOCTOR: We've gone through a dimensional portal thingy. 
419,"LILY: Well, what's that supposed to be? Where did it come from? "
420,"DOCTOR: It was a present, and it wasn't supposed to be opened till"
421,"Christmas Day. Honestly, who opens their Christmas presents early?"
422,Okay. Shut up. Everyone. 
423,(The forest whispers. 
424,"Further ahead, the tracks Cyril is following are getting larger and"
425,larger.) 
426,"LILY: I don't understand. Is this place real, or is it fairyland? "
427,"DOCTOR: Fairyland? Oh, grow up, Lily. Fairyland looks completely"
428,"different. Now, these are Cyril's footprints, and these are the ones he"
429,was following. Notice anything? 
430,LILY: The other footprints are getting bigger. 
431,"DOCTOR: Yes. Whatever your brother's following, it's growing. "
432,"LILY: Well, we have to get after him. "
433,"(Lily runs forward, brushing against a tree and knocking some of its"
434,snow off. It grows baubles.) 
435,"DOCTOR: It's okay, you're fine. Don't worry. "
436,LILY: Is that tree alive? 
437,DOCTOR: Of course it's alive. It's a tree. 
438,LILY: But is it dangerous? 
439,DOCTOR: Every rose has its thorns. 
440,LILY: They're like Christmas tree decorations. 
441,DOCTOR: Yeah. Naturally occurring Christmas trees. How cool is that? 
442,LILY: I don't understand. 
443,DOCTOR: It's a big universe. Everything happens somewhere. Call it a
444,"coincidence. Call it an idea echoing among the stars. Personally, I"
445,call it a brilliant idea for a Christmas trip. Or it should've been. Do
446,you know the difference between wind and trees talking to each other? 
447,LILY: What? 
448,"DOCTOR: No wind. I've been here many times, but I've never heard the"
449,trees so active. Something's wrong. What are you doing? What are you up
450,to? 
451,(The Doctor looks at a bauble and his reflection turns into the image
452,of a wooden man.) 
453,"DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Lily, I really am, but there is something very wrong"
454,"in this forest, and your brother's right in the middle of it."
455,
456,[Main sitting room]
457,
458,"MADGE: Lily and Cyril Arwell, where are you? "
459,(Madge investigates the open box.)
460,
461,[Not Narnia]
462,
463,(Cyril has arrived at steps up to a door in a stone
464,tower with a glass dome roof. 
465,"Madge has put on a coat, got a torch and followed her children through"
466,the box. 
467,Cyril goes inside the tower and closes the door behind him. There are
468,"no floors, just a staircase around the walls, and he can see all the"
469,way to the top. There is also a wooden King sitting on a throne. Cyril
470,starts to walk up the stairs. The wooden
471,King blinks and turns his head.) 
472,LILY: Why would you bring us to this place? 
473,DOCTOR: It was supposed to be a treat. This is one of the safest
474,planets I know. There's never anything dangerous here. 
475,(The ground shakes.) 
476,DOCTOR: There are sentences I should just keep away from.

485,DROXIL: What the hell are you doing here? 
486,"VEN GARR: No, wait, armed! No, unarmed. Sorry, sir. She's wearing wool,"
487,"sir. The natural fabrics, they interfere with the "
488,DROXIL: Please say we can tell the difference between wool and side

492,"VEN GARR: Not always, sir, no. "

501,"In the tower, Cyril goes through an open door. It closes behind him."

503,on his trail -) 
504,LILY: It's just irresponsible. How can you do this to my brother? 
505,DOCTOR: It was meant to be a supervised trip. 
506,LILY: To the future? 
507,"DOCTOR: Future, yes. "
508,LILY: The future on a different planet. 
509,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, very different. "

518,"LILY: What, are we going in? "
519,DOCTOR: Cyril did.

522,
523,DOCTOR: Interesting. 
524,LILY: What's that? Is that a statue? What is it? It's like a King. 
525,"DOCTOR: A King, possibly, but not a statue. Look at the floor. This is"
526,what Cyril was following. The growing thing. Hatched from a bauble on a
527,"tree. Grew to this size in less than an hour, I'd say. Impressive. And"
528,"so is this building. Yes. It's grown, see. This building, it isn't a"
529,building. It's a group of trees grown in the shape of a building.
530,"Disguised as a building. Ooo, clever. I love. Clever, clever old"
531,"forest. So, a forest grows a building. Why would it do that, Lily? "
532,LILY: I don't know. 
533,DOCTOR: Why is there honey in a honey trap? 
534,LILY: Because it's a trap? 
535,"DOCTOR: Exactly. Thing about people, we can never resist a door. "
536,"LILY: So this is a trap. What, we've just walked straight into a trap? "
537,"DOCTOR: A people trap. Question is, why does a forest need people? "
538,LILY: We should go. We have to get out of here. 
539,DOCTOR: Except? 
540,LILY: Except Cyril was here.

557,DROXIL: Nobody's looking. 
558,BILLIS: Doesn't mean there's no visual.

569,We're stepping away from our guns. Now can we interrogate you? We're

596,LILY: How can trees grow into a building?

598,once. She fancied me.

600,LILY: Look at that.

602,LILY: But there are stars. There are stars coming out. 
603,"DOCTOR: Yes, that does happen, Lily. Cyril! "
604,"LILY: Yes, but out of the trees. What is that? "
605,"DOCTOR: Life force. Pure life force, just singing. "
606,LILY: Beautiful. Doesn't it make you want to cry? 
607,DOCTOR: Crying when you're happy. Good for you. That's so human.

835,DOCTOR: Fine? You've got a whole world inside your head.

841,CYRIL: No. 
842,"DOCTOR: Lily, you do, don't you? "
843,LILY: No. 
844,"DOCTOR: Course you do. Think about it. Weak and strong. It's a translation. Translated from the base code of nature itself. You and I,"
845,"Cyril, we're weak. But she's female. More than female, she's mum. How else does life ever travel? The Mother ship. "

853,"old home and you'll be safe out here. But these people helped you, and they're in my protection. Now help them. How do we get home? "
854,MADGE/QUEEN: Think. 
855,DOCTOR: Sorry? What? 
856,MADGE/QUEEN: She must only think. 
857,"DOCTOR: Madge, did you hear that? You said it, but did you hear it?"
858,You've got to think. 
859,MADGE: Think what? 
860,"DOCTOR: Think of home. Just picture it, feel it! You have to really"
861,feel it. Can you do that? Your mind is controlling this vessel. You can
862,fly us all back for Christmas. 
863,"MADGE: My head is full of trees, Caretaker. Can't you fly us home? "
864,"DOCTOR: I don't have a home to think of. And between you and me, I'm"
865,older than I look and I can't feel the way you do. Not any more. And
866,"you really need to feel it, Madge. Everything about home that you miss"
867,until you can't bear it. Until you almost burst.

876,"are you going home for? What's pulling you there? Please, try. Please,"

922,lying on the floor. The circlet has fallen off Madge's head.) 
923,"DOCTOR: Cyril, Lily, are you all right? "
924,MADGE: Are they dead? 
925,"DOCTOR: No, they're just wood now. They've been emptied. The forest has"
926,"gone from your head too, hasn't it. "
927,MADGE: But where is it now? 
928,DOCTOR: The life force of the whole forest has transmuted itself into a
929,"sub-etheric waveband of light, which can exist as a "
930,(He is stopped by a Look.) 
931,"DOCTOR: The souls of the trees are out among the stars, and they're"
932,"shining, very happy. And you got them there. Well done, Madge. "
933,MADGE: And where are we? 
934,DOCTOR: Home! Christmas morning. 
935,(They are outside Uncle Digby's house.) 
936,DOCTOR: We've taken a bit of a short cut. Haven't you always wanted to
937,do that? 
938,LILY: Mother? 
939,"MADGE: Oh, look at you. You've been so brave, you. Look, we're home"
940,"again, see? "
941,"LILY: What did you mean, watch him die? Where's Father? Where is he?"
942,"Where's Daddy? Why are you holding a telegram? Well, what does it say? "
943,"CYRIL: Please, just tell us. "
944,LILY: Tell us! 
945,DOCTOR: I imagine you'd prefer to be alone. 
946,"MADGE: I don't believe anyone would prefer that. Stay close, Caretaker."
947,
948,DOCTOR: I'll be right outside. 
949,(The Doctor leaves.) 
950,"MADGE: Lily, Cyril. "
951,[Outside Uncle Digby's house]
952,
953,"MADGE : A few nights ago, your father, who as"
954,"you know, was the best of men and the bravest of pilots "
955,[Dome]
956,
957,MADGE: Was flying home for Christmas. His plane was
958,"badly damaged, and his instruments failed him. Unfortunately, he was"
959,"flying on a night where there was no moon, and because it was very"
960,"cloudy, there were no stars to. There were no stars to light his way. "
961,CYRIL: Did he get lost? 
962,"MADGE: Yes, Cyril. He got so very lost. "
963,"DOCTOR: Er, sorry to interrupt. You might want to pop out here for a"
964,moment. 
965,"MADGE: Caretaker, I'm talking to my children. "
966,"DOCTOR: I know, and before you go any further, I think you'd better"
967,come and look. 
968,[Lawn]
969,
970,"(More like a field, a bit rough and overgrown.) "
971,"DOCTOR: No stars to light the way, Madge? There was one. "
972,[Bomber]
973,
974,DOCTOR : There was you. 
975,CO-PILOT: What is it? 
976,"REG: I don't know, but it's all we've got. We can follow it. "
977,"(And he does, through the Time Vortex.)"
978,
979,[Lawn]
980,
981,"DOCTOR: Madge Arwell, who flew a whole forest"
982,"though the Time Vortex, plus one husband. "
983,(The Bomber has landed safely.) 
984,"DOCTOR: He did it again, Madge. He followed you home. Look what you can"
985,"do, Mother Christmas. "
986,"REG: Madge, what am I doing here? "
987,"MADGE: It's Christmas Day, my love! Where else would you be? "
988,REG: Christmas Day? How? 
989,MADGE: We took a short cut. 
990,(Big family reunion.) 
991,LILY + CYRIL: Daddy! 
992,DOCTOR: Happy crying. Humany wumany.
993,
994,[Attic]
995,
996,"(Down in the main sitting room, the happy family"
997,"are doing a jigsaw in front of a roaring fire. Later, Madge comes into"
998,the attic and sees the Tardis. The Doctor comes out of it.) 
999,DOCTOR: Ah. 
1000,"MADGE: Of course. It's you, isn't it? My spaceman angel, with his head"
1001,on backwards. 
1002,DOCTOR: How do I look the right way round? 
1003,MADGE: Funnier. 
1004,DOCTOR: Okay. 
1005,MADGE: So you came back. 
1006,"DOCTOR: Well, you were there for me when I had a bad day. Always like"
1007,"to return a favour. Got a bit glitchy in the middle there, but it sort"
1008,of worked out in the end. Story of my life. 
1009,MADGE: Thank you. 
1010,"DOCTOR: Oh, you did it all yourself, Madge Arwell. But thanks for"
1011,thanking me. 
1012,"MADGE: Now, the last time I saw you, I went back the next day, but the"
1013,police box had gone. 
1014,DOCTOR: Yeah. You want to see how it's done? 
1015,"MADGE: No. I want you to stay for Christmas, please. "
1016,"DOCTOR: Ah, well, you see, things to do, people to see. "
1017,MADGE: Of course. Yes. Family of your own. 
1018,"DOCTOR: Well, no, actually. "
1019,"MADGE: Oh. Yes, yes, you said no family. But there must be people who"
1020,love you. Friends. 
1021,"DOCTOR: No. Well, yes, but. It's a long story. But they all think I'm"
1022,"dead. Never mind. Anyway, watch my box do its thing. It's really cool."
1023,You'll love it. 
1024,MADGE: No. No one should be alone at Christmas. 
1025,DOCTOR: I'm fine. I don't mind. I'm really very good at being 
1026,"MADGE: I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about your friends. You"
1027,can't let them think that you're dead. Not at Christmas. 
1028,DOCTOR: It's complicated. Very complicated. It's far too complicated to
1029,explain right now. 
1030,MADGE: You must tell them. At once. Off you go. 
1031,"DOCTOR: Yes, Mum. I'll think about it. "
1032,(He kisses her on the cheek.) 
1033,"DOCTOR: Now, eyes on the box. "
1034,"MADGE: Oh, Caretaker? What if I require you again? "
1035,DOCTOR: Make a wish. 
1036,(He goes into the Tardis and it dematerialises as Reg comes in.) 
1037,REG: What the hell was that? 
1038,MADGE: That was just the Caretaker returning to the Time Vortex. It's a
1039,lovely place. I've been there myself. Shall we go downstairs?
1040,
1041,[Front door]
1042,
1043,(The Doctor knocks on a blue suburban front door
1044,with a yale lock.) 
1045,"AMY : Argh! If that is more carol singers, I have a water pistol!"
1046,You don't want to be all wet on a night like this. 
1047,(She opens the door and squirts the Doctor.) 
1048,DOCTOR: Not absolutely sure how long 
1049,AMY: Two years? 
1050,"(Squirt, squirt, squirt.) "
1051,DOCTOR: Okay. Fair point. 
1052,"AMY: So, you're not dead. "
1053,DOCTOR: And a happy New Year! 
1054,AMY: River told us. 
1055,"DOCTOR: Well, of course she did. "
1056,AMY: She's a good girl. Well? I'm not going to hug first. 
1057,DOCTOR: Nor am I. 
1058,(They spend a few moments not looking at each other before laughing and
1059,hugging.) 
1060,AMY: Mister Pond! Guess who's coming for dinner? 
1061,"RORY: Whoa. Not dead, then. "
1062,AMY: We've done that. 
1063,RORY: Oh. 
1064,AMY: We're about to have Christmas dinner. Joining us? 
1065,DOCTOR: If it's no trouble. 
1066,RORY: There's a place set for you. 
1067,DOCTOR: But you didn't know I was coming. Why would you set me a place?
1068,
1069,"AMY: Oh, because we always do. It's Christmas, you moron. "
1070,RORY: Come on. 
1071,"(Amy and Rory go inside. The Doctor hesitates, then feels his face. It"
1072,is wet with happy tears.)
