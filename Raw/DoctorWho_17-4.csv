20, [Empress bridge] 
21, (A large space liner makes the jump to warp.) 
22,"RIGG: We seem to be ahead of schedule, Secker. "
23,(Secker has a silly grin on his face.) 
24,SECKER: Great. 
25,RIGG: What? 
26,SECKER: The sooner the better. 
27,RIGG: Oh. 
28,(He makes a broadcast.) 
29,RIGG: Captain here. We're coming out of warp in thirty seconds. 
30, [Empress Passenger deck] 
31," (On the passenger deck, everyone is dressed in"
32,"sunglasses, hooded silver jumpsuits and seated in rows of three seats,"
33,airplane style. A pleasant female voice makes an announcement.) 
34,COMPUTER: This is your flight computer speaking. We are about to go
35,into orbit around the planet Azure. Passengers may leave their seats
36,"when the blue light comes on, but are requested not to remove their"
37,protective coveralls until instructed. Will passengers please remember
38,"that the Empress will be at seven tenths G, so please be careful when"
39,you first start to move around. Thank you. 
40, [Empress bridge] 
41, (A red light suddenly lights up on the Captain's
42,console.) 
43,"RIGG: I've got a malfunction. Check it out, will you? "
44,(Secker just sits grinning to himself.) 
45,"RIGG: Secker, these coordinates are wrong. Did you set these? "
46,SECKER: What's a few degrees? 
47,"RIGG: What's a few degrees? What's the matter with you, man? We're"
48,"flying an interstellar cruise liner, not riding a bicycle! "
49,SECKER: So? 
50,RIGG: So we shall be going into the wrong orbit! 
51,SECKER: So? 
52,"RIGG: Well, it could mean delays. It could. Oh. "
53,"(Rigg tries to correct it himself, then suddenly a small red spaceship"
54,appears right in front of them as they come out of warp.) 
55,RIGG: Oh no! 
56,"(As the Empress solidifies, the red ship is stuck into her forward"
57,section.) 
58,"RIGG: Mayday, mayday, mayday. This is cruise liner Empress reporting"
59,collision. Space collision on approach to Azure. 
60, [Empress corridor] 
61, (Two crewmen run to where the two ships have
62,joined as alarm bells ring. The taller one uses a hand-held
63,communicator.) 
64,"RIGG : Damage control, report to the bridge. "
65,"CREWMAN: The two ships are sticking straight through each other, sir. "
66,RIGG : Any blowouts? How's the pressure? 
67,CREWMAN: Everything's okay except we can't get through to some of the
68,"passenger sections. They're blocked off. The hull of the other ship,"
69,"sir, is sticking right across the entrance to B deck. "
70, [Empress bridge] 
71," RIGG: A deck, report. A deck, are there any"
72,casualties? 
73,(Just static on the monitor.) 
74,RIGG: Have you got that damage report yet? Well? 
75,"(Rigg hauls the grinning, stoned Secker out of his chair and takes his"
76,place.) 
77,"RIGG: Oh, it's all your fault, Secker. I'll carry the can. I'll lose my"
78,"job but you, you'll never work in West Galaxy again. Go on, check the"
79,"power, man. Come on, move yourself! This is an emergency! "
80,(Secker saunters over to a grid on the wall and presses a button.) 
81, [B deck] 
82, (The Tardis materialises close to a hatchway where
83,the red ship is clearly visible. The Doctor and Romana come out.) 
84,DOCTOR: Hmm. 
85,ROMANA: Fascinating. 
86,DOCTOR: Bit of a mish-mash. 
87,ROMANA: Why wasn't there an explosion? 
88,"DOCTOR: Well, one of the ships must have been in dematerialised form"
89,when it happened. Nasty. Could cause terrible problems. 
90,"K9: Affirmative. The overlap areas are highly unstable, master. "
91,"DOCTOR: Yes. Interfaces, I should say. "
92,K9: Affirmative. 
93,ROMANA: I don't think we should interfere. 
94,DOCTOR: Interfere? Of course we should interfere. Always do what you're
95,"best at, that's what I say. Now, come on. "
96, [By the airlock] 
97," (On beige level,Â  blond man in a white"
98,pressure suit and carrying a helmet comes out of the airlock just
99,before Romana and the Doctor walk round the corner.) 
100,ROMANA: Who was that? 
101,DOCTOR: I don't know. 
102,ROMANA: Shall we follow? 
103,DOCTOR: At our own pace. 
104, [Empress bridge] 
105, (The man in the pressure suit is with the
106,Captain.) 
107,DYMOND: What are you going to do about the damage to my ship? 
108,"RIGG: Mister Dymond, I am concerned with my ship, my crew, and nine"
109,hundred passengers. We're fully covered comprehensive on all third
110,"party damage, so don't worry. "
111,"DYMOND: I was involved in the most important job, and you just come"
112,"crashing in on me, then you tell me not to worry? What am I going to do"
113,for a ship? 
114,RIGG: The Company will compensate you. Get in touch with your insurance
115,people! 
116,(The Doctor and Romana enter unnoticed.) 
117,DYMOND: Then I insist that you sign a document to the effect that this
118,collision was entirely your fault! 
119,"RIGG: I can't do that! What were you doing there, anyway? You were"
120,right in the middle of a launch and land window for commercial flights.
121,
122,DYMOND: I was given complete clearance from Azure Control. You were off
123,course! 
124,"DOCTOR: Gentlemen, gentlemen, please. I'd say it was knock for knock,"
125,wouldn't you? 
126,RIGG: What? Are you a passenger? 
127,"DOCTOR: No, no. We answered your mayday. I'm from Galactic Insurance"
128,"and Salvage. Been having a look around. This is my assistant, Romana."
129,I'm the Doctor. How do you do? 
130,RIGG: How'd you do. What's that? 
131,"DOCTOR: Oh, K9? Well, a computer of sorts. "
132,RIGG: It looks more like a dog. Does he bark? 
133,DOCTOR: No. But he has been know to bite. Aren't we going to introduce
134,ourselves? 
135,"RIGG: Oh, yes. My name's Rigg, Captain Rigg. "
136,DOCTOR: We just met. 
137,"RIGG: Yes. Er, this is Mister Dymond, the owner of the other vehicle"
138,"involved in the, er, incident. "
139,DOCTOR: How do you do. 
140,"RIGG: Salvage, you say? "
141,DOCTOR: Yes. 
142,"RIGG: Yes, well, I can't discuss anything until I've spoken to the"
143,Company. 
144,DOCTOR: What about a better idea? Why don't we try to separate the
145,ships? 
146,DYMOND: Impossible. 
147,DOCTOR: I like doing the impossible. 
148,"ROMANA: If it's possible to get into the situation, theoretically it"
149,should be possible to get out of it. 
150,"DOCTOR: Oh, you've spoilt it now. "
151,"ROMANA: But look, at the time of the collision this ship was partially"
152,dematerialised. 
153,DOCTOR: Therefore if we can recreate identical circumstances the ships
154,could be separated. 
155,ROMANA: It's just a question of exciting the molecules. Put your ship
156,on full thrust. 
157,DOCTOR: Then full reverse. 
158,"ROMANA: Well, it's worked before, you know. "
159,DOCTOR: I preferred it when it seemed impossible. 
160,"RIGG: Yes, well, it might work if I could get any power. "
161,DOCTOR: Are you pressing the right button? 
162,RIGG: Of course I am. 
163,DOCTOR: Can we switch on the wreck of the power unit? 
164,"RIGG: Well, we could do, but it's dangerous. "
165,DYMOND: Worth a try anything to get out of this mess. 
166,RIGG: It could damage your ship. 
167,DYMOND: That's nice coming from someone who's just crashed into it.
168,I'll risk it. 
169,"DOCTOR: All right, all right. Where's the power unit? "
170,"RIGG: Secker'll show you. Secker, take the Doctor to the power unit. "
171,"DOCTOR: Good. No, Romana, you stay here. I might need you. I'll take"
172,K9. K9? K9? 
173,"K9: Affirmative, master. Affirmative. "
174,"(Secker, the Doctor and K9 leave.) "
175,"RIGG: Well, Romana, why don't you and Mister Dymond wait in the lounge?"
176,
177,ROMANA: Right. 
178,RIGG: Just down the corridor on the right. 
179,(Romana and Dymond leave. Rigg goes to a monitor and calls up the
180,details of Galactic Salvage and Insurance. Formed London Earth 2068.
181,Liquidated 2096.) 
182, [First class corridor] 
183, (Secker stops grinning and leans against the
184,wall.) 
185,"SECKER: You go down here to section five, then left into the"
186,"shuttlebay, and down to level B. You can't miss it. "
187,"DOCTOR: Hold on, I thought the idea was you'd show me. "
188,"SECKER: I've told you, haven't I? What's the difference? I'm busy. "
189,(Secker walks off.) 
190,DOCTOR: How very odd. 
191,K9: Affirmative. 
192, [Luggage area] 
193, (They follow Secker as he staggers into a darkened
194,area and watch as he uses a keycard to open a filing cabinet. He takes
195,"out a small container and leaves. The Doctor enters, uses his sonic"
196,screwdriver to open the cabinet and gets another container out. He
197,opens it and offers some of the contents to K9 on his hand for
198,analysis.) 
199,"DOCTOR: Any idea what this is, K9? "
200,K9: A fungus. Source of the drug XYP. 
201,DOCTOR: Yes? 
202,"K9: Dangerous, addictive. Known as Vraxoin. "
203,"DOCTOR: Vraxoin? I've seen whole communities, whole planets destroyed"
204,by this. It induces a kind of warm complacency and a total apathy.
205,"Until it wears off, that is, and soon you're dead. Come on. "
206, [Lounge] 
207, (A bespectacled man with a vaguely teutonic cum
208,slavic accent is holding forth to Romana. His female assistant stands
209,nearby.) 
210,TRYST: It is my ambition to become the first zoologist to qualify and
211,quantify every species in our galaxy. One more trip and I may achieve
212,it. 
213,ROMANA: Are you planning another? 
214,"TRYST: Ah, well, the next is always on my mind, but is a question of"
215,"finance. I was hoping to meet a sponsor on Azure, but this accident may"
216,have ruined my chances. 
217,ROMANA: A sponsor? 
218,"TRYST: Yes, well, the government used to fund me, but the galactic"
219,recession put a stop to that. Now all they do is to assign me special
220,"travel facilities on government subsidised spacelines, but first class."
221,
222,ROMANA: What's that machine? 
223,(A free standing object about a metre tall with a diamond shaped box on
224,the top.) 
225,"TRYST: Ah, that is my CET machine. The Continuous Event Transmuter. It"
226,is an invention of mine. I will show you. 
227,"(He switches the machine on, and a whole wall sized screen set up a"
228,little way forward of the end of the lounge lights up. It shows a
229,"landscape with mountains in the distance, some trees and mist on the"
230,ground.) 
231,ROMANA: It looks as if you've invented the cinematograph. 
232,"TRYST: What you see may seem to be just a mere projection, but it is in"
233,fact a matter transmutation. 
234,"DELLA: You see, when we've collected the specimens for study, they're"
235,converted into electromagnetic signals and stored on an event crystal
236,in the machine. 
237,TRYST: And they go on living and evolving. 
238,DELLA: In the crystal. 
239,TRYST: This image projection allows us to see them whenever we wish.
240,The flora and the fauna are actually in a crystal. I hope you can
241,appreciate what a technical achievement that is. 
242,ROMANA: A crude form of matter transfer by dimensional control. 
243,TRYST: Crude? 
244,"ROMANA: Well, prototype. And you could have problems with it. "
245,TRYST: Problems? But it works perfectly. 
246,ROMANA: Nothing works perfectly. 
247,"TRYST: Oh, yes, but "
248,ROMANA: What about the materialisation collision? It's caused all sorts
249,of unstable matter interface. They'll probably affect the dimensional
250,matrix of your machine. 
251,TRYST: The what? 
252,ROMANA: Have you thought of that? 
253,TRYST: Are you claiming superior knowledge? 
254,"ROMANA: Equal, perhaps. "
255,DYMOND: I wish everyone would stop showing off and get something done
256,about my ship. 
257, [Empress bridge] 
258," RIGG: We seem to have to have a slight problem,"
259,Azure. We're doing out best to sort it out and meanwhile we'll continue
260,to orbit. Rigg out. 
261,(The Doctor harrumphs.) 
262,"RIGG: Ah, Doctor. The man from Galactic. "
263,DOCTOR: Yes. 
264,RIGG: Back so soon? 
265,DOCTOR: Yes. I'll tell you something about your man Secker. 
266,RIGG: What about him? 
267,DOCTOR: He ran away. 
268,"RIGG: Yes, well, he has been behaving rather strangely. Seems to be in"
269,a different world. 
270,DOCTOR: Yes. Perhaps he's unwell. Can I have a look at your log and
271,check to see if he's been to any planet where he might have picked up
272,Vraxoin? 
273,"RIGG: Doctor, this is the milk run. Station nine to Azure, Azure to"
274,Station nine. A straight charter for the whole season. 
275,DOCTOR: What about one of the passengers? One of them could have been
276,"the carrier, so to speak. "
277,"RIGG: No, Doctor. They've all had prevocation checks. The Azurian"
278,authorities insist on it. 
279,DOCTOR: Anyone else? 
280,RIGG: Tryst. 
281,DOCTOR: Tryst? 
282,RIGG: Yes. A zoologist. He arrived at Station nine after a long
283,expedition with his equipment and he's looking for a holiday. 
284,DOCTOR: Where had he been? 
285,"RIGG: Well, all over. Oh, but he's all right. We checked him over. "
286,"DOCTOR: Yes, but I'd still like to know where he's been. "
287,"RIGG: Yes, and I'd like to know just who you are. "
288,DOCTOR: Me? 
289,RIGG: Yes. 
290,"DOCTOR: Well, I told you. I'm from Galactic. "
291,RIGG: Galactic went out of business twenty years ago. 
292,DOCTOR: I wondered why I hadn't been paid. 
293,RIGG: Now that's not good enough. 
294,DOCTOR: That's what I thought. Where can I find Tryst? 
295,"RIGG: Well, he's in the first class lounge. "
296,"DOCTOR: Good, good. Look, you try and find Secker and meet me in the"
297,first class lounge and 
298,"RIGG: Yes, and "
299,"DOCTOR: No, no. Do you want this ship repaired or not? "
300,"RIGG: Well, yes, of course I do. "
301,"DOCTOR: Well then, just find Secker and meet me in the lounge in five"
302,minutes. 
303,RIGG: But I 
304,DOCTOR: Bye. 
305, [B deck] 
306," (Secker is blissed out again, and walking towards"
307,the intersection of the two ships.) 
308,"RIGG : Secker, report to the bridge. "
309,(He disappears into the void.) 
310, [Lounge] 
311, DOCTOR: Really? Then where did you go? 
312,TRYST: We went through the Cygnus gap. 
313,DOCTOR: What? 
314,"TRYST: And then we did a slingshot over to a small system, just three"
315,"planets, M37. You know? "
316,DOCTOR: I do. 
317,TRYST: The second planet supports life in a very early stage of
318,"evolution. The molluscs, the algae, the primitive insects. I can show"
319,you. 
320,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, that's perfectly all right. I'm just interested in"
321,the voyage. It's fascinating. 
322,"TRYST: Here you are, a copy of my log. I published it to go with my"
323,lectures. 
324,DOCTOR: The Volante. 
325,"TRYST: Yes, the name of my ship. "
326,DOCTOR: And you invented this marvellous machine to collect your
327,"specimens? You know, I knew a man once who toyed with an idea like"
328,this. What was his name? Professor Stein? 
329,TRYST: Professor Stein? 
330,DOCTOR: Yes. 
331,"TRYST: Oh, a dear friend. He was my mentor. We worked on this idea"
332,"together before he died, of course. Then we stopped. You knew him? "
333,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, by reputation. He once gave a seminar on the "
334,"DYMOND: Doctor, Doctor, Doctor. All very well reminiscing but don't we"
335,have an urgent problem to deal with? I'm anxious to be on my way. 
336,DOCTOR: Of course. You're extremely anxious to be on your way. 
337,"DYMOND: Yes. You see, I didn't actually expect a spaceliner to"
338,materialise halfway through my ship today. 
339,DOCTOR: No. 
340,"RIGG: Doctor, we can't locate Secker. My men are still looking. "
341,DOCTOR: Could you take me to the power unit yourself? 
342,"RIGG: Well, yes, all right. "
343,"DOCTOR: Good, good. Tryst, thank you very much for your story. Very"
344,interesting. We must have a chat about this machine of yours sometime. 
345,TRYST: Yes. 
346,DOCTOR: And about the notion of your capturing alien species for your
347,own private zoo. 
348,TRYST: Zoo? 
349,DOCTOR: Yes. 
350,"TRYST: No, Doctor, this is important scientific research. I am helping"
351,to conserve endangered species. 
352,DOCTOR: By putting them in this machine? 
353,"TRYST: Oh, yes. "
354,"DOCTOR: Ah, yes, of course. Just in the same way a jam maker conserves"
355,raspberries. 
356,(The Doctor and Rigg leave.) 
357,"ROMANA: Oh, don't mind him. He just likes to irritate people. "
358,(Romana picks up the copy of Tryst's log.) 
359,"TRYST: Yes, well, he has a right to criticise. I suppose. Still, I'm"
360,"very pleased to have someone of intellect to speak with again, after"
361,such a long voyage cooped up with all the same peoples. 
362,ROMANA: How many were on your ship? 
363,"TRYST: Ah, well, to begin with there was ten, but we lost one. "
364,ROMANA: How? 
365,TRYST: He died. 
366,ROMANA: How did he die? 
367,TRYST: He died. 
368, [Corridor] 
369, RIGG: Did you find out anything from Tryst? 
370,DOCTOR: No. K9 checked all the planets he'd been to. 
371,K9: Affirmative. 
372,DOCTOR: None of them could explain Secker's condition. 
373,RIGG: Are you certain? 
374,DOCTOR: Absolutely sure. 
375,(They round a corner to see the interface of the two ships.) 
376,RIGG: Oh dear. 
377,K9: Caution. Area of overlap is highly dangerous. Molecular structure
378,"of the two ships is incompatible, causing matter interface. "
379,RIGG: What? 
380,DOCTOR: Fascinating. The two ships are rejecting each other.
381,"Molecularly speaking, that is. "
382,"RIGG: Like a tissue transplant, you mean. "
383,DOCTOR: Exactly. Exactly. Is there another way to the power unit? 
384,"RIGG: Well, we can try from below the shuttlebay. We'll have to cut our"
385,"way through. I could put in a request for lasers, have them sent up"
386,from Azure. 
387,DOCTOR: That won't be necessary. I've got my own equipment. 
388, [Lounge] 
389, (Romana goes to the CET machine and turns the dial
390,"on the top from Bros to Ranx. Other choices available are Gidi, Eden,"
391,"Zil, Vij, Darp and Lvan. Another landscape appears, this time a plain"
392,whose trees have round balls on the top. Gidi has a duststorm blowing.
393,"Eden is a dark, dense, lush tropical forest with birdsong. Romana walks"
394,forward. There is a human male partially concealed in the foliage. He
395,moves out of sight. Della enters the lounge.) 
396,DELLA: What are you doing? 
397,"ROMANA: Oh, I was just having a look. I hope you don't mind. "
398,(Della switches the machine off.) 
399,"DELLA: I don't, no. "
400,ROMANA: Then why have you switched it off? 
401,DELLA: I don't mind. Tryst does. This machine's his baby. Nobody
402,touches it except for him. 
403,ROMANA: Has it ever gone wrong? 
404,DELLA: No. Why should it? 
405,ROMANA: Pff. Lots of reasons. Do you think I could just have a look at
406,"that last one? Eden, I think it's called. "
407,"DELLA: No, not that one. "
408,ROMANA: What's the matter? 
409,DELLA: It's just that Eden brings back such unpleasant memories for me.
410,That was where we lost the other crewmember. 
411,"ROMANA: Oh, I see. He was a friend of yours. "
412,"DELLA: More than that, but it doesn't matter now. Excuse me. "
413, [Interface below the shuttlebay]
414,
415," RIGG: We won't be able to make it, Doctor. The"
416,place to cut through is beyond that overlap. 
417,DOCTOR: Where's the power unit? 
418,RIGG: Up there. 
419,(A man's scream comes from inside the interface. Rigg and the Doctor
420,run in.) 
421,"K9: Caution, master. You're entering a matter interface. "
422,(They drag Secker out. He has three large scratch marks down the side
423,of his face.) 
424,RIGG: What the devil did that? 
425,DOCTOR: I don't know. 
426,(Rigg uses his communicator.) 
427,RIGG: Medics level four. Meet you at the elevator. Move! 
428,"DOCTOR: K9, see if you can find anything in there. "
429,"K9: The mist is a matter interface and therefore dangerous, master. "
430,DOCTOR: Just go near the edge. 
431,(They drag Secker away.) 
432,"K9: Affirmative, master. "
433,(K9 trundles in then backs straight out again.) 
434,"K9: Sensors will not function in the environment, master. "
435, [By the lift] 
436, (The Doctor accompanies Rigg on the elevator to
437,level 4 where the Captain puts Secker onto a gurney brought by two
438,medics.) 
439,"RIGG: Let's get him to the sickbay, quick! "
440, [Luggage area] 
441, (The Doctor returns to where the drugs were
442,stashed. Someone wearing a very large ring on their left little finger
443,has got the cabinet open. The Doctor looks around then notices a gun
444,pointed at him.) 
445,"DOCTOR: Hello. No wait, please. "
446,(The Doctor gets shot. The mystery figure takes the Vraxoin sample from
447,his coat pocket and leaves.) 
448, [Sickbay] 
449, (Medics work on Secker's injuries in an isolation
450,booth. Rigg and Della watch through an observation window.) 
451,"RIGG: It was an attack by somebody, or something. "
452,DELLA: Horrible. But why? 
453,RIGG: I don't know. Have you ever seen anything like that before? 
454,"DELLA: No. No, I haven't. "
455,(Tryst enters.) 
456,"TRYST: Ah, Captain, I get your message. What is the problem? "
457,RIGG: Look at this. 
458,TRYST: Where did this happen? 
459,RIGG: Down under the shuttlebay. Secker was in one of the matter
460,interfaces. 
461,"TRYST: Yes, that could be the answer. Who knows what forces exist in an"
462,unstable zone such as that? 
463,RIGG: You didn't hear the scream. Tryst. 
464,(They move away from Della.) 
465,"RIGG: You didn't bring any live specimens on board my ship, did you? "
466,"TRYST: Oh, no, Captain. I assure you. No, all my specimens are laser"
467,crystal recordings. 
468,"RIGG: Good, good. "
469,(He returns to the observation window. The chief medic shakes his
470,head.) 
471, [Corridor] 
472, (K9 leads the way down a dim corridor.) 
473,"K9: This way, mistress. "
474,ROMANA: How far? 
475,K9: Approximately seven metres and closing. 
476, [Luggage area] 
477, ROMANA: Doctor! What happened? 
478,DOCTOR: I. Bushwhacked! 
479,ROMANA: What? 
480,K9: Please clarify. Statement does not compute. 
481,DOCTOR: Bushwhacked! 
482,K9: Oh. Bushwhacked. Cowardly attack by a person or persons unknown. 
483,DOCTOR: Gone. 
484,ROMANA: Has something been stolen? 
485,DOCTOR: Yes. Someone aboard this ship is smuggling drugs. Vraxoin. 
486,ROMANA: Vraxoin! 
487,DOCTOR: Yes. 
488,ROMANA: I thought that was stamped out long ago. 
489,DOCTOR: Yes. 
490,"ROMANA: The only known source was destroyed, wasn't it? "
491,DOCTOR: That's right. They incinerated an entire planet. Someone's
492,found another source. 
493, [Empress bridge] 
494, DYMOND: What is the man doing? He comes up with a
495,marvellous idea then he fiddles about. 
496,"RIGG: I've got my own problems, Dymond, including a dead navigator. And"
497,now the Doctor says he's going to blast his way into the shuttlebay.
498,How do I explain a great gaping hole in the side of the ship? 
499,DYMOND: I just wish he'd get on with it. I've got a schedule to keep. 
500,RIGG: So have I. 
501, [By the lift] 
502," ROMANA: Doctor, this machine. "
503,"DOCTOR: What, the lift? "
504,"ROMANA: No, not the lift, the CET machine. "
505,DOCTOR: What about it? 
506,ROMANA: It doesn't just take recordings. 
507,"DOCTOR: Oh no, the animals themselves are converted into magnetic"
508,"signals, and their habitats. "
509,ROMANA: So he's left bald patches on the planets he's visited? 
510,"DOCTOR: Yes. The CET machine's just an electric zoo. For cages, read"
511,"laser crystals. Either way, the animals are trapped inside. "
512,ROMANA: I hope so. 
513,DOCTOR: What do you mean? 
514,"ROMANA: Well, you saw how primitive the device was. It's terribly"
515,unstable. This ship is full of unstable matter zones. It gives me the
516,creeps. It wasn't just a mirage that attacked Secker. 
517,RIGG: Killed him. 
518,DOCTOR: What? 
519,RIGG: Secker's dead. They couldn't save him. 
520,DOCTOR: That's a pity. He might have been able to say what attacked
521,him. 
522,(The lift finally arrives.) 
523,"RIGG: I asked Tryst, but he couldn't help either. "
524,"DOCTOR: Right, first things first. Romana, you take care of the CET"
525,machine. 
526,(The Doctor puts Romana into the lift. 
527,ROMANA: What are you going to do? 
528,"DOCTOR: Separate the ships. Come on, Rigg. "
529,(Romana runs into the empty lounge and switches on the CET machine. She
530,sets the dial to Eden and walks towards the projection.) 
531, [Corridor] 
532," DOCTOR: Well, Captain, you'll have to show us the"
533,best place. 
534,"RIGG: It's a pity we can't get further up there, and I don't want to"
535,damage an airseal or cut through a stress point. 
536,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sure K9 will be careful, won't you, K9? "
537,"K9: Affirmative, master. "
538,"DOCTOR: Go. Make it as big as you can, K9. "
539,(K9 starts cutting into the bulkhead at just below shoulder height.) 
540,"RIGG: Very handy, that machine of yours, Doctor. "
541,"DOCTOR: He's not just a mobile blowtorch, you know. He's saved my life"
542,"on lots of occasions. Beat me at chess, once. Shush. "
543,"(Up in the first class lounge, something like a speck of light comes"
544,out of the Eden projection and touches Romana's neck. She collapses. 
545,K9 finishes cutting.) 
546,"RIGG: Right, Doctor, give me a hand. "
547,"(They remove the cut section, and a Thing with claw-like hands reaches"
548,out towards them.) 
549, Part Two
550,
551, [Corridor] 
552, (K9 fires at the alien creature and it retreats.) 
553,RIGG: What the devil was that? 
554,DOCTOR: I don't know. 
555,RIGG: And what in the name of the suns is it doing on board the ship?
556,"First a collision, then a dead navigator, and now a monster roaming"
557,about my ship! It's totally inexplicable. 
558,DOCTOR: Nothing's inexplicable. 
559,RIGG: Then explain it! 
560,DOCTOR: It's inexplicable. We'd better put it back. 
561,(He puts the cut section of bulkhead back into its hole and K9 welds it
562,in place.) 
563,RIGG: It must have been that that got Secker. 
564,"DOCTOR: Maybe, but Secker was a dead man already. "
565,RIGG: What do you mean? 
566,DOCTOR: He was taking Vraxoin. 
567,"RIGG: Oh, no. "
568, [First class corridor] 
569, RIGG: None of my passengers could have brought it
570,on board the ship. 
571,DOCTOR: Dymond's ship? 
572,"RIGG: No, I've scanned it. Still, I'll scan the Empress again. "
573,"DOCTOR: Yes, the Vraxoin must be found. "
574,"RIGG: Yes, it's bad stuff. "
575,DOCTOR: Bad stuff? It's the worst. I've seen whole planets ravaged by
576,it while the merchants made fortunes. 
577,"RIGG: Your people knew it would be on board, did they? "
578,"DOCTOR: What, my people? "
579,"RIGG: Well, you're an agent, aren't you? "
580,DOCTOR: No! I'm the Doctor. I keep telling you that. 
581,"RIGG: Yes, but who do you work for? "
582,DOCTOR: Work for? I don't work for anybody. I'm just having fun. 
583,RIGG: Everybody works for somebody. 
584, [Empress bridge] 
585," RIGG: If there's any Vraxoin on board, it'll show"
586,up on the scan. 
587,"(Rigg presses buttons, and a schematic of the Empress comes up on the"
588,monitor. The scan is a pair of vertical lines slowly moving from bow to
589,stern.) 
590,DOCTOR: Can you check the whole ship with this? 
591,RIGG: Every nook and cranny. Nothing in the forward section. 
592,(The scan lines vanish briefly then restart.) 
593,DOCTOR: Secker kept his in the luggage area. I took what was left then
594,"someone took it from me. After stunning me, that is. "
595,RIGG: Who? 
596,"DOCTOR: Yes, who indeed. "
597,RIGG: Nothing. 
598,DOCTOR: Is there any possible shield against that scan? 
599,"RIGG: No, no, no. "
600,DOCTOR: Really? 
601,"RIGG: Well, any shield would be too small to hide any useful quantity"
602,of the stuff. 
603,"DOCTOR: Yes, a small thick tube. Very mysterious. "
604,RIGG: But this drug is hardly our most pressing problem. 
605,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know, I know. We've got to get the ships separated. "
606,"RIGG: Yes, but how to get through to the power unit? "
607,"DOCTOR: Yes. You know, there might be a way we can do it using my ship."
608,
609,RIGG: Your ship? 
610,DOCTOR: Yes. 
611,"RIGG: Yes, where is your ship, by the way? "
612,"DOCTOR: Oh, around. "
613,RIGG: Well there you go again. How do I know I can trust you? 
614,"DOCTOR: Yes. Or I you, Captain. "
615,"RIGG: Oh, that's hardly the point. "
616,"DOCTOR: Yes, but who's helping whom? "
617,"RIGG: All right, what do you want me to do? "
618,"DOCTOR: Right, when I give the word, I want Dymond to put his ship on"
619,"full power. Trust me, Captain. "
620, [Lounge] 
621, (Someone in heavy boots leaves Romana lying on the
622,floor just before Della comes in.) 
623,DELLA: Romana! Are you all right? 
624,ROMANA: I don't know. I think so. 
625,DELLA: What happened? 
626,ROMANA: Oh. I must have fainted. 
627,DELLA: Was it anything to do with the machine? 
628,"ROMANA: Yes. I was watching the projection, and then I. Oh. It isn't on"
629,anymore. I just felt hot. I must have fainted. 
630,DELLA: I asked you not to put that particular image on. 
631,"ROMANA: Yes, I know, but as I was on my own I thought I'd just have"
632,"another look. Besides, you assured me that it was perfectly safe,"
633,didn't you. 
634,DELLA: Of course. I'll tell you what. I'll get you something to drink.
635,You look quite pale. 
636, [Vending area] 
637, (Della goes through to the vending area just off
638,"the main lounge, opposite the projection, and punches buttons on the"
639,dispenser.) 
640,"RIGG: Ah, Della. "
641,"DELLA: Oh, hello, Captain. "
642,RIGG: That's just what I was after. 
643,(A mystery hand pours the contents of a small bottle into the dispensed
644,drink.) 
645,"DELLA: Oh, it's for Romana. She's fainted. I'll get one for you. "
646,(She takes out the glass and puts it on a table.) 
647,"RIGG: Fainted, you say? It wasn't something she saw, was it? "
648,"DELLA: No, I think she just felt hot. "
649,"RIGG: Oh, why don't I just take this one. "
650,DELLA: Help yourself. 
651,RIGG: Thanks. 
652,"(Rigg leaves with the dosed glass, and Della takes the fresh one back"
653,to the lounge proper.) 
654, [B deck] 
655, (The Doctor brings a piece of equipment out of the
656,"Tardis, with the power cord trailing inside.) "
657,DOCTOR: I want to get as close as possible. 
658,"K9: Predict only sixty percent chance of success, master. "
659,"DOCTOR: Tell me, K9, how is it that, how is it you always look on the"
660,black side of things? 
661,(The Doctor expands the equipment into a purple laser on an adjustable
662,stand.) 
663,"DOCTOR: Here am I, trying a little lateral thinking, and what do you"
664,do? You trample all over it with logic. 
665,"K9: It is a question of the localised power available, master. I"
666,predict 
667,"DOCTOR: Sixty percent. I heard you, I heard you. But it's worth a try."
668,"Now, come on. Let's go and find your mistress. Come on. Come on. "
669, [Empress bridge] 
670, DYMOND: I've got to be away soon or I'll lose my
671,contract. A year's work for nothing. Do you realise that? It's all your
672,"fault, Captain. You were off course. "
673,RIGG: And you shouldn't have been in that sector. 
674,"TRYST: Gentlemen, please. Blaming each other won't help anything. The"
675,only person who seems to be able to do anything constructive is the
676,"Doctor, and we must support him. "
677,"RIGG: Yes, yes. I just wish we knew more about him. You know he's got"
678,some bee in his bonnet about drug smuggling on the ship. 
679,TRYST: Drug smuggling? 
680,RIGG: Yes. There isn't any evidence to back up his suspicions. There
681,"isn't a trace of any drug anywhere on the ship at all. Still, I think"
682,that's the least of our worries. 
683,(And finished his dosed drink.) 
684, [Lounge] 
685, DOCTOR: Are you sure about that? That creature
686,came through the picture? 
687,ROMANA: Yes. 
688,"DOCTOR: You were right about this machine. It is unstable, and that"
689,creature's escaped from its electric zoo. I wonder where it came from? 
690,ROMANA: A planet called Eden. 
691,DOCTOR: Eden? 
692,ROMANA: Do you know it? 
693,"DOCTOR: Well, it rings a bell. "
694,(Tryst enters.) 
695,"TRYST: Ah, Doctor. I have a message for you. Oh, I'm so delighted that"
696,you are taking an interest in my CET machine. 
697,DOCTOR: I'm absolutely amazed. 
698,"TRYST: Yes. Well, it is rather impressive, isn't it. "
699,"DOCTOR: No, I mean I'm amazed at you, Tryst, using a machine like this"
700,when it's still so primitive. The whole thing's utterly unstable. 
701,"TRYST: Well, I value your opinion, Doctor. "
702,"DOCTOR: Good, good. I value my life and this machine makes me fear for"
703,it. 
704,TRYST: It does? 
705,DOCTOR: Yes. 
706,"TRYST: Well, what do you think is so wrong? "
707,"DOCTOR: Well, at a rough guess I'd say the spatial integrator,"
708,"transmutation oscillator, hologistic retention circuit. Shall I go on? "
709,TRYST: Yes. 
710,DOCTOR: Dimensional osmosis damper? 
711,"TRYST: Er, the what? "
712,DOCTOR: You mean you haven't even got a dimensional osmosis damper?
713,"Professor, you don't realise how unstable this machine is. "
714,"TRYST: Yes, yes, all right, Doctor. In spite of your interest, I have"
715,decided to shut it off until I've had a chance to make some
716,adjustments. 
717,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm delighted to hear it. "
718,"TRYST: Yes, no, no, and it doesn't matter what you are saying, I'm"
719,going to switch it off. 
720,DOCTOR: Good! 
721,"TRYST: Yes. Oh, I nearly forgot. "
722,DOCTOR: What? 
723,TRYST: The message. The separation of the ships. Dymond is waiting for
724,you. 
725,"DOCTOR: I'm on my way. Romana, off to the Tardis. I'll give you details"
726,later. Tryst! Don't you forget to switch that off. 
727, [Empress bridge] 
728, (Rigg is rather too happy with life.) 
729,"RIGG: You know what, Dymond? The Empress has eaten your ship. Ha ha!"
730,Eaten it. 
731,"DYMOND : I don't see why you find it so funny. After all,"
732,you stand to lose your Captaincy over this. 
733,"RIGG: Yeah, I know, I know, I know. I mean, that's funny in itself,"
734,isn't it. 
735,(The Doctor enters.) 
736,"DOCTOR: Stay there, K9. Stay there. Right then, Dymond. Ready for"
737,another try? I want you to put your ship on full power. Not now. When I
738,tell you. 
739,"DYMOND : Right, Doctor. "
740,"RIGG: Where are you going to be, Doctor? "
741,"DOCTOR: Here, if it's all right with you. Romana's in my ship. I can"
742,keep an eye on things from here. 
743,"RIGG: Oh, be my guest. "
744,DOCTOR: Thank you. Romana? 
745,"ROMANA : All ready, Doctor. "
746,"DOCTOR: Good, good. We're just waiting on Dymond. K9? "
747,"K9: Yes, master? "
748,"DOCTOR: Just in case your prediction is correct, go along to one of the"
749,blurred areas and take a reading for me. 
750,K9: Affirmative. 
751,DOCTOR: Good dog. 
752,K9: Success only sixty percent owing to factors of localised energy. 
753,"DYMOND : Ready when you are, Doctor. "
754,DOCTOR: Good. Start building up power. 
755,"RIGG: Well, I'll leave you to it, Doctor. I'm thirsty. "
756,(Rigg leaves.) 
757,"DOCTOR: Romana, get ready. What did you say? Romana, get ready. "
758,"(K9 arrives at an interface point, which clears. He trundles forward"
759,"towards a door labelled power unit, then it goes blurred again. He"
760,vanishes.) 
761,"DYMOND : I'll have to switch off, Doctor. My ship's"
762,breaking up. 
763,"DOCTOR: No, no. Come on, Dymond, now. Don't lose your nerve. We're"
764,almost there. Just a bit longer. 
765,"DYMOND : No, she won't take it! "
766,"DOCTOR: Romana, switch off. Something's wrong. I'll go and find K9."
767,He's taking a reading for me. 
768, [By the interface area] 
769, (K9 is at the power unit door when the Doctor
770,arrives at the blurred area.) 
771,"DOCTOR: K9? K9, where are you? K9? He must have slipped through. Good"
772,"boy, K9! "
773,A figure in passenger coveralls and dark glasses comes out of a door
774,behind the Doctor. He turns.) 
775,"DOCTOR: Ah, could I have a word with you, please? "
776,(The figure runs away. The Doctor follows. The figure runs into the
777,"lift, so the Doctor takes the stairs down. The figure gets out at a"
778,lower floor just before the Doctor gets there. The chase continues into
779,the passenger area.) 
780, [Passenger area] 
781," (The Doctor bursts into Passenger Pallets 67-90,"
782,to discover that the coveralls and glasses are what all the passengers
783,are wearing.) 
784,WOMAN: What's going on? 
785,DOCTOR: I'm looking for a man dressed just like you. 
786,MAN: When are we going to land? We've been stuck for ages. How much
787,longer? 
788,DOCTOR: Which way did he go? This way? 
789,MAN 2: Maybe that's the entertainment? 
790,(The Doctor's quarry goes out through the rear door. The Doctor follows
791,him through another compartment.) 
792,DOCTOR: Excuse me. 
793,(And another.) 
794,DOCTOR: Excuse me. 
795,(And another.) 
796,WOMAN 2: What's the meaning of this? Why aren't we going down to Azure?
797,
798,"DOCTOR: I promise you, everything possible is being done. "
799,WOMAN 2: But what are they doing about it? 
800,"DOCTOR: Here, have a jelly baby and don't forget to brush your teeth. "
801,(The running man gets back to the lift and heads back up. The Doctor
802,does not run up the stairs.) 
803, [By the interface area] 
804, (The man is waiting at the top of the stairs when
805,the Doctor arrives in the lift. He produces a gun then runs round the
806,corner to an interface area.) 
807,"DOCTOR: I only wanted a word with you, whoever you are. You took"
808,"something from me, old chap. I'd rather like to have it back. "
809,"(The man runs into the mist, and the Doctor follows.) "
810, [Lounge] 
811, (The drugged Captain Rigg is finding life highly
812,amusing at present.) 
813,"RIGG: Little ships in big ships. Ships in bottles. Russian dolls,"
814,that's what it's like. You remember those? 
815,(Tryst shakes his head.) 
816,"ROMANA: Yes, I do. I wonder if the people who made them realised they"
817,were making a model of the universe? 
818,RIGG: A what? Eh? 
819,"ROMANA: As a primitive concept, you know. "
820,TRYST: I don't think the Captain is in a mood to discuss philosophy.
821,"Can I get you anything, Rigg? A caffetine capsule, perhaps? RIGG: No,"
822,let's talk about life while I await my dismissal and eventual execution
823,for dereliction of duty and I really couldn't care less. 
824,"TRYST: Oh, come on, Captain. The Doctor may still come up with"
825,something. 
826,"RIGG: The Doctor. The enigmatic, almighty Mister Fix-it. He's failed"
827,again and I don't care about that either. 
828,ROMANA: Not yet. I'd better go and see what he's doing. 
829,"TRYST: Oh, please. "
830,(Romana leaves.) 
831,"RIGG: Hey. Hey, it's them. They're the ones who are doing the drug"
832,"smuggling, you know? So the Doctor isn't going to do anything at all,"
833,right? 
834, [In the interface] 
835, (They seem to be running forever.) 
836,"DOCTOR: I just want to talk to you. I promise you, you'll enjoy it."
837,Stop! 
838, [Lounge] 
839," RIGG: Okay, so the Doctor's an agent. Yes, that's"
840,it. He's a narcotics agent. 
841,"TRYST: And we must give him all the help that we can. Here, drink this."
842,"It'll make you feel better. There. And Romana, is she an agent too? "
843,"RIGG: What if she is? I mean, I don't care. What does it matter? I"
844,"mean, nothing matters at all. "
845, [By the lift] 
846, ROMANA: Doctor? 
847, [In the interface] 
848, (The mystery man jumps the Doctor from behind.) 
849,DOCTOR: What are you doing? 
850,"(He wrestles the Doctor to the ground, then the creature from the wall"
851,arrives.) 
852, [By the interface area] 
853, ROMANA: Doctor? Where are you? 
854,"(The growling can be heard, then the creature walks out of the mist."
855,"Someone shoots it several times before it backs away, then the Doctor"
856,crawls out.) 
857,ROMANA: Doctor! Are you all right? There's a creature in there. It's
858,horrible. We've got to get away. What were you doing in there? Come on!
859,
860,"DOCTOR: Romana, stop. Do you know I've just come through an interface?"
861,That's no mean feat. I'm not even sure I'm all here. 
862,ROMANA: You mean you've been right through to the other side? 
863,"DOCTOR: Yes, I have, I have. Did you see anyone while I was in there?"
864,"Coveralls, dark glasses. "
865,"ROMANA: Well, someone shot at that creature and drove it off. "
866,DOCTOR: It must have been the chap I was chasing. The fellow who jumped
867,"me in the luggage section. Still, I know something about him now. He"
868,dropped his radiation band in the struggle just now. Look. Volante. 
869,ROMANA: Tryst's ship? 
870,DOCTOR: Yes. 
871, [Lounge] 
872, (Tryst switches on the CET machine. It is set to
873,Eden. Della enters.) 
874,DELLA: What's the matter with Captain Rigg? 
875,"TRYST: Oh, I think he found the whole thing a little too much, but he'll be all right. "
876,DELLA: Good. I thought you told the Doctor you wouldn't use the CET
877,again? 
878,"TRYST: Ah, yes, but I'm using for his benefit, Della. "
879,DELLA: Oh? 
880,TRYST: Yes. The Doctor is looking for someone on this ship who is
881,carrying Vraxoin. 
882,DELLA: Vrax? 
883,"TRYST: Yes, Vrax. The Doctor is probably a narcotics agent, so we are"
884,all under suspicion. So I thought perhaps that we might put our own
885,"house in order, as it were. "
886,DELLA: How do you mean? 
887,"TRYST: Well, Della, I've been thinking about Stott, our sadly lamented"
888,"crewman and your close friend, and his strange behaviour on Eden. Might"
889,"it be him who discovered a new source of Vrax? But he died, of course,"
890,didn't he. 
891,DELLA: What are you suggesting? 
892,"TRYST: No, Della, I'm sorry to do this, but I must be certain about a"
893,"few things, not the least to eliminate the possibility that the Volante"
894,and my expedition was used to transport this detestable substance. Now
895,"let us assume, for a moment, that it was Stott. He must have had an"
896,accomplice. Someone who would take over from him when he died. 
897,DELLA: Are you accusing me? 
898,"TRYST: No, no, no, I'm not accusing you, Della. I'm just asking you."
899,Was it Stott? 
900,DELLA: Of course not. I knew him. He wouldn't do anything like that. 
901,"TRYST: Then why did he disappear for two hours on Eden, the day before"
902,he was killed? 
903,DELLA: I don't know. I don't know anything about that. 
904,TRYST: Of course. 
905, [First class corridor] 
906, DOCTOR: Rigg said Tryst and Della were the only
907,ones from the expedition to come aboard. 
908,ROMANA: A stowaway? 
909,"DOCTOR: Well, we have to ask Rigg. "
910,ROMANA: He's hit the bottle. 
911,DOCTOR: What? 
912,ROMANA: He doesn't care about anything anymore. He just laughs and
913,"giggles the whole time, sick grin on his face. "
914,"DOCTOR: Well, that doesn't sound like drunkenness to me. "
915,ROMANA: Vraxoin? Where from? 
916,"DOCTOR: Well, inside the projection set. It's the only place. Romana,"
917,we've got no choice. 
918,ROMANA: What do you want to do? 
919,DOCTOR: What we have to do. We've got to get inside that machine. Come
920,on. 
921,(Tryst comes round the corner behind them.) 
922,"TRYST: Ah, Doctor. Doctor, Rigg has told me about the drugs. "
923,"DOCTOR: Oh, really. "
924,"TRYST: Yes. Doctor, I believe I can help you over this problem. "
925,DOCTOR: You can? 
926,TRYST: Yes. Er. 
927,"DOCTOR: Romana, please. "
928,(Romana leaves.) 
929,"TRYST: Doctor, I'm very sad to say that I think the drugs were smuggled"
930,"on board my ship, and I'm pretty certain I know who it was. "
931,DOCTOR: You are? 
932,TRYST: Yes. One of my crew. But he was killed. But I think he passed
933,the drugs on before he died. 
934,DOCTOR: Yes. 
935,TRYST: Yes. To Della. 
936,DOCTOR: What! 
937,"TRYST: I question her, of course, but she wouldn't admit it. "
938,"DOCTOR: Well, maybe it's because she's innocent. How'd you know she did"
939,it? 
940,TRYST: Doctor 
941,(An alarm sounds.) 
942,DYMOND : Calling the Doctor. Would the Doctor please report to the
943,bridge immediately. 
944,"DOCTOR: Thank you, Tryst. "
945,(Tryst leaves the way he came. The Doctor walks round the corner to
946,Romana.) 
947,DOCTOR: Did you hear that? 
948,"ROMANA: Della, indeed. "
949, [Power unit] 
950, K9: Have located power unit. Awaiting
951,"instructions, master. "
952,(K9 sticks his laser out at the creatures surrounding him.) 
953, [Bridge] 
954, (The Doctor and Romana enter to find Dymond with
955,two black-leather clad men. The little peaked caps mark them out as
956,officious jobsworths even before they open their mouths.) 
957,"DYMOND: Ah, Doctor. This is Waterguard Fisk and Landing Officer Costa"
958,of the Azurian Excise. I've been telling them 
959,"DOCTOR: Good, good. Now listen. "
960,FISK: Can I see your ident plaque? 
961,"DOCTOR: Can I just tell you something, please? "
962,FISK: Let me see it. Now. 
963,DOCTOR: On this ship 
964,"FISK: The plaque, please, sir. "
965,"COSTA: (to Romana) And yours, please. "
966,ROMANA: I haven't got one. 
967,DOCTOR: Neither have I. 
968,FISK: That's extremely serious. 
969,DOCTOR: Drugs. Vraxoin. 
970,"FISK: Names and dates of birth. Come on, come on. "
971,ROMANA: Romana. 
972,FISK: Romana who? 
973,DOCTOR: Will you please listen? Someone aboard this ship is smuggling
974,drugs. 
975,COSTA: Name and date of birth. 
976,DOCTOR: Well how would I know? I don't even know who he is yet. 
977,COSTA: Your name and date of birth. 
978,"DOCTOR: Oh, well, I'm called the Doctor. Date of birth difficult to"
979,"remember. Sometime quite soon, I think. "
980,FISK: I would advise you not to play the fool with us. 
981,ROMANA: We wouldn't want to. 
982,DOCTOR: Would you please listen? Vraxoin is the biggest killer drug in
983,existence and it's on this ship! 
984,FISK: All in good time. 
985,DOCTOR: There's no good time. The criminals must be caught. 
986,FISK: Costa. 
987,COSTA: Right. I'll start with you. 
988,(Costa runs an electronic sniffer wand over Romana.) 
989,COSTA: She's clean. 
990,(It's the Doctor's turn.) 
991,DOCTOR: You're wasting your time. 
992,(Beep beep) 
993,FISK: What is it? 
994,COSTA: Vraxoin. Traces of it in his pocket. 
995,"FISK: So, the criminals must be caught, eh, Doctor? "
996,"DOCTOR: Oh, for heaven's sake, Fisk "
997,FISK: You're under arrest. 
998,DOCTOR: All right. Can I just say one thing at this moment? 
999,FISK: Well? 
1000,DOCTOR: It's simply that. Look! 
1001,"(The Doctor points to the monitor. Fisk and Costa turn, and the Doctor"
1002,and Romana run out.) 
1003,DOCTOR: We've only got a few seconds. 
1004,"(The Doctor hits the door close button, trapping Fisk, Costa and Dymond"
1005,inside briefly.) 
1006, [Lounge] 
1007, (The Doctor closes the door.) 
1008,"DOCTOR: Quick, Romana. CET machine, quickly. "
1009,ROMANA: It's running. 
1010,DOCTOR: Get me Eden. 
1011,(The Doctor blows the lock with his sonic screwdriver then takes a
1012,piece from the CET machine.) 
1013,ROMANA: Now what do we do? 
1014,DOCTOR: Test an old theory of mine. Come on. 
1015,ROMANA: But we can't. It's unstable! 
1016,"DOCTOR: Come on, Romana. We must, we must. "
1017,ROMANA: We'll get torn apart. 
1018,DOCTOR: We've got no alternative. Come on. Come on. 
1019,(He takes her hand and they run into the projection of the jungle of
1020,Eden.) 
1021, Part Three
1022,
1023, [Eden] 
1024," DOCTOR: Well, how do you like Eden? "
1025,ROMANA: I don't. 
1026,"DOCTOR: Might give us a few answer, though. "
1027,ROMANA: Which way? 
1028,DOCTOR: Let's go east. 
1029,ROMANA: How do you know which way is east? 
1030,"DOCTOR: Well, I don't. We'll go that way and we'll call it east. "
1031,ROMANA: Why not call it north? 
1032,"DOCTOR: All right, we'll call it north. "
1033,ROMANA: North-east? 
1034,(Something large roars nearby.) 
1035,"DOCTOR: (sotto) Can we go, please? "
1036,"(They tiptoe off into the dark jungle, followed by one of those"
1037,creatures.) 
1038, [Lounge] 
1039," (Fisk, Costa and Dymond get the doors open.) "
1040,FISK: Doctor! 
1041,(They stare briefly at the projection of Eden.) 
1042,"FISK: Come on, you may as well give yourself up. "
1043,COSTA: There must be another way out of here. 
1044,DYMOND: I don't know. 
1045,FISK: There's got to be. What's that? 
1046,DYMOND: It's a door. 
1047,FISK: It's locked. Get Tryst. 
1048,(Dymond leaves.) 
1049, [Eden] 
1050, ROMANA: How did you know we could get into the
1051,projection? 
1052,DOCTOR: The same way I knew we could get into the Tardis. Tryst doesn't
1053,"realise what he's stumbled on. At least, I don't think he has. "
1054,ROMANA: A relative dimensional field? 
1055,DOCTOR: Yes. All this is recorded on laser crystal. When it's played
1056,back 
1057,ROMANA: It's restructured on an intradimensional matrix. 
1058,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, roughly speaking. "
1059,"ROMANA: So without the dimensional osmosis damper, everything gets"
1060,mixed up together and we can just walk straight into the projection. 
1061,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1062,ROMANA: And anything else can just walk straight out. 
1063,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1064,ROMANA: I've never met such idiots as those customs men. 
1065,"DOCTOR: Idiots? They're worse than idiots, they're bureaucrats. They"
1066,"just exist to tangle people up, wrap them round and round in red tape"
1067,until they can't move. Romana? 
1068,ROMANA: Yes? 
1069,DOCTOR: I can't move. 
1070,(Roots are wrapping themselves around their legs. The Doctor has one
1071,round his throat. A giant Venus flytrap opens its mouth and starts to
1072,reel him in.) 
1073,"DOCTOR: Don't wriggle, don't wriggle. It'll realise it's got dinner. "
1074,ROMANA: Dinner? 
1075,DOCTOR: Yes. It eats people. 
1076,ROMANA: Doctor! 
1077,"DOCTOR: Quick, over there. The root. "
1078,ROMANA: Root? 
1079,"DOCTOR: Root, root! "
1080,"(Romana pulls a very big root over to the Doctor, who bites it. Green"
1081,"yuk spurts out and the plant relaxes its grip on them, then collapses.)"
1082,
1083,ROMANA: Are you all right? 
1084,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1085,ROMANA: Let's get out of here. 
1086,"DOCTOR: You know, that didn't taste at all bad. "
1087, [Lounge] 
1088, TRYST: I can't turn it off. The selector's gone.
1089,It's difficult to believe the Doctor would do this. Why? 
1090,"FISK: The man is a criminal, that's why. "
1091,TRYST: I don't see the logical connection. 
1092,"FISK: Well, criminals are like that. "
1093,TRYST: Oh. 
1094,"FISK: Now, this other exit, can you open it? "
1095,TRYST: It leads to the first class bathroom. The Doctor couldn't open
1096,"it, it opens by personal key. "
1097,FISK: It's the only way he can 
1098,(Tryst opens the door. Fisk and Costa go in to search for the Doctor.) 
1099,"TRYST: I think the Doctor is in serious trouble, Dymond. It's a pity."
1100,Such a brilliant mind. 
1101, [Eden] 
1102, (More nearby growls. The Doctor and Romana duck
1103,down by a large rock.) 
1104,ROMANA: Doctor? 
1105,DOCTOR: Shush. It's waiting for us to make any kind of sound. 
1106,(The creature lumbers slowly past.) 
1107,DOCTOR: (sotto) It's gone. Now take care. 
1108,(They take a few steps forward. The Doctor smiles then the creature
1109,leaps up in front of them. Romana squeals and they jump back. A man
1110,comes out from behind a plant and shoots at the creature.) 
1111,ROMANA: What was that? 
1112,"DOCTOR: I don't know. Hello there, thank you very much. We're terribly"
1113,grateful to you for saving our lives. 
1114,ROMANA: Who are you? 
1115,STOTT: The name's Stott. 
1116,DOCTOR: Stott! Stott of the Tryst expedition? 
1117,STOTT: Yes. 
1118,(The Doctor hands over the radiation band.) 
1119,"DOCTOR: Yours, I believe. I'm the Doctor, this is Romana. We're"
1120,travellers and 
1121,(Growls) 
1122,"DOCTOR: Come on, this way. "
1123,STOTT: I know a safe place. Follow me. 
1124, [Stott's module] 
1125, (Stott brings them into a prefabricated building
1126,"with diamond windows, shelves, table and chairs, bunk, and various bits"
1127,of equipment.) 
1128,"DOCTOR: Not bad, not bad at all. How long have you been here? "
1129,STOTT: A hundred and eighty three days. They left me for dead on Eden.
1130,"I tried to get back here to call the ship, and I got caught up in the"
1131,event transmuter. 
1132,ROMANA: How did you get those marks? 
1133,"(Three scars on his face, like Secker had.) "
1134,STOTT: A mandrel. The thing I saved you from. 
1135,"ROMANA: Mandrel. Doctor, they're called mandrels. "
1136,"DOCTOR: Well, Stott, you've got some explaining to do. A hundred and"
1137,eighty three days here? 
1138,STOTT: Yes. I thought I was going to be stuck here for the rest of my
1139,life. There were a few times when I felt like blowing my brains out.
1140,The hardest thing was being able to look out and see Della. 
1141,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, quite. Tell me, when did you first discover you could"
1142,get out of the projection? 
1143,STOTT: After the accident. Something must have gone wrong with the CET
1144,machine. The edge of the projection was shimmering. 
1145,DOCTOR: Really? 
1146,"STOTT: I decided I had nothing to lose, so I walked straight through it"
1147,and found myself on the Empress. Then I took one of the passenger
1148,coveralls so I could walk about unnoticed. 
1149,DOCTOR: Why didn't you tell Tryst and Della you'd got out? 
1150,STOTT: Because of what I am and what I'm doing. 
1151,DOCTOR: Really? 
1152,"STOTT: I'm a Major in the Intelligence section of Space Corps, on a"
1153,special assignment to find out who's drug running. 
1154,"DOCTOR: Ah ha. You thought it was me, didn't you. "
1155,STOTT: For a while. Then I overheard you and Romana talking in the
1156,lounge. 
1157,"ROMANA: Tryst thought it was you, and now he thinks it's Della. "
1158,STOTT: Tryst's a fool. He knows nothing. He didn't even realise his
1159,expedition was being used to transport a new sort of Vrax that someone
1160,had found. 
1161,"ROMANA: Yes, if you store in on crystal in the CET machine, it can't"
1162,possibly show up on a molecular scan. 
1163,STOTT: He must have arranged somewhere along the line for a pick-up.
1164,They'd have to get the stuff out of the projection and pass it on. 
1165,DOCTOR: Yeah. You've got the stuff I had? 
1166,STOTT: Just a tiny sample. Secker must have found it. He may even have
1167,been involved himself. 
1168,"DOCTOR: Yes, but more important is where the main supply is hidden and"
1169,where it comes from. 
1170,STOTT: All I know is that it's in Eden somewhere. I've been searching
1171,all this time. No result. 
1172,DOCTOR: Then we've got to get the dimension projection sealed off
1173,"again, which means doing what we first came to do. "
1174,STOTT: And what's that? 
1175,"DOCTOR: Separate the ships. Tell me, if we go out of the projection in"
1176,"that direction, do we come to the power unit? "
1177,"STOTT: Yes, you can get out of the projection any way you want. "
1178,"DOCTOR: Good, good. Then that's what we'll do. Come on. Well, come on. "
1179,(Stott turns the lights out and shuts the door after himself.) 
1180, [Outside the Power unit] 
1181, (K9 is there when Stott walks through the wall.) 
1182,K9: Identify. 
1183,(The Doctor and Romana come out.) 
1184,"STOTT: Look out, Doctor. "
1185,"DOCTOR: It's all right, he's mine. "
1186,STOTT: What is it? 
1187,DOCTOR: It's just a perfectly ordinary electric dog. 
1188,"K9: Master, I have located the power unit. "
1189,"DOCTOR: Good, good. Now listen, K9. This is Stott. He's a friend. All"
1190,right? 
1191,K9: Affirmative. 
1192,DOCTOR: Good. Let's get to work. (Stott and K9 stand guard.) 
1193, [Power unit] 
1194," DOCTOR: Liquid hydrogen, turbopump exhaust,"
1195,"reactor core, pressure shell. Right. "
1196,"ROMANA: Doctor, do you really know how to get this thing going? "
1197,DOCTOR: Of course I do. I can start anything from a steam engine to a
1198,Tardis. Have you got a match? 
1199,ROMANA: What for? 
1200,DOCTOR: I want to jam this switch down. 
1201,ROMANA: Would a toothpick do? 
1202,(The one in the Doctor's mouth.) 
1203,DOCTOR: Perfect. 
1204,"K9: Master, during your absence I encountered alien creatures in this"
1205,area. 
1206,"ROMANA: Mandrels, K9. "
1207,"K9: Name noted, mistress. "
1208,"DOCTOR: You'd better guard the door, K9. How many were there? "
1209,"K9: Five units, master. "
1210,DOCTOR: Five! I'd better get a move on or they'll be all over the ship.
1211,
1212,ROMANA: Hadn't we better deal with them first? 
1213,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. Until the ships are separated and the projection is"
1214,"stabilised, it'd be like trying to bail out a small boat with a "
1215,ROMANA: Sieve? 
1216,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1217," [Passenger corridor, by the lift]"
1218,
1219, ATTENDANT: We're doing everything we can. The
1220,skipper's got 
1221,WOMAN 2: We should have been on Azure hours ago. My passengers asked me
1222,"to represent them, to take our complaint to the Captain. "
1223,"ATTENDANT: You must understand, he's very busy in the emergency. He's"
1224,doing everything possible to get you to Azure. 
1225,(The flight attendant presses the lift button. The doors open and a
1226,mandrel pounces on the woman. A second one gets him as he sounds the
1227,alarm.) 
1228, [Empress bridge] 
1229, (Rigg laughs at the scenes of carnage on the
1230,"monitor, as mandrels attack the helpless passengers.) "
1231,"COSTA: What's going on, Captain? "
1232,"RIGG: Nothing much, nothing much. "
1233,COSTA: What's happening? What are those things? 
1234,RIGG: They're a sort of judgment on us all. 
1235,"COSTA: What? I'll have you shot for this, Captain. "
1236,(He uses the intercom.) 
1237,COSTA: Bridge here. Emergency. The passengers on pallet sixty seven are
1238,under attack. All armed crewmembers proceed to pallet sixty seven
1239,immediately! (to Rigg) I shall be charging you with gross neglect of
1240,"duty. The passengers should be your first concern, yet I find you"
1241,drunkenly looking on as they are attacked and killed! Well? 
1242,RIGG: They're only economy class. What's all the fuss about? 
1243, [Power unit] 
1244, (The Doctor is working inside a control unit.) 
1245,"DOCTOR: Is that the one, Romana? Romana, was that "
1246,ROMANA: Mandrel! 
1247,DOCTOR: K9! 
1248,(The mandrel grabs the Doctor in a bear hug.) 
1249,"DOCTOR: K9, quickly! "
1250,(K9 shoots the mandrel and it falls.) 
1251,"STOTT: Doctor, they're coming from both ways. "
1252,"DOCTOR: I've got to get this finished. Romana, did you check the cable"
1253,to the reactor? 
1254,"ROMANA: Yes, I'm pretty sure it was that one. "
1255,"DOCTOR: Well, check it. I need to be absolutely sure. "
1256,(She hesitates at the mandrel. The Doctor kicks it.) 
1257,DOCTOR: It's perfectly all right. It's quite dead. 
1258,ROMANA: If you say so. 
1259,(She jumps over the body.) 
1260,DOCTOR: Was it the one? 
1261,"ROMANA: No, sorry. It's the one below. "
1262,DOCTOR: It's a good thing you checked. I could have caused a
1263,spectacular explosion. 
1264,ROMANA: All ready to go now? 
1265,"DOCTOR: Nearly. Two things. One, I need to know whether the power on"
1266,"the bridge is on maximum. Two, the demat has to be switched on from the"
1267,Tardis at exactly the same time I switch on this old gas oven. All
1268,right? 
1269,ROMANA: All right. 
1270,DOCTOR: Good. 
1271, [Bridge] 
1272," FISK: Captain, this ship is a disaster area. I'm"
1273,placing you under arrest for gross neglect of duty. 
1274,(Costa twists Rigg's arm behind his back.) 
1275,"RIGG: Hey, it's really nice being arrested. "
1276,(Costa takes Rigg out.) 
1277,"FISK: Now, about the, er, mandrels? "
1278,TRYST: Yes. 
1279,FISK: Mandrels. We need to seal them off and then destroy them. I'll
1280,send for heavy weapons. 
1281,"TRYST: I'd rather if they're not killed, if that's possible. "
1282,"FISK: The things are killing our people, man. What do you suggest? "
1283,TRYST: Some sort of tranquillising drug? 
1284,FISK: We haven't got time for pussyfooting around! I can't think why
1285,"you care so much about such ugly, disgusting things. "
1286,"TRYST: It's all a matter of conservation. If they are killed, the whole"
1287,species will have gone. 
1288,"FISK: Look, I'm in charge here. I'll do what I think is best. "
1289,CREWMAN : Level B. Two mandrels have got into the fuel
1290,section. 
1291,FISK: Then kill them. 
1292,"CREWMAN : Well, we're worried about hitting the fuel tanks"
1293,if we fire. 
1294,"FISK: You see what I mean, Tryst? Keep them under surveillance, and if"
1295,"they move out of there, destroy them. "
1296,"CREWMAN : Aye, aye, sir. "
1297,FISK: Has the Doctor been seen in that sector? 
1298,"CREWMAN : No, sir. "
1299,"FISK: Yes, well, pass the word around that if he offers the slightest"

1301,"CREWMAN : Shoot him, sir? "
1302,"FISK: He's a criminal, isn't he? What else do you do with criminals? "
1303,CREWMAN : Sir. 
1304, [Power unit] 
1305," DOCTOR: Stott, I want you and Romana to go back"
1306,"through the jungle. K9, I want you to go back the way you came. "
1307,"K9: Negative, master. Blurred zone still operative. These zones are"
1308,matter interfaces. 
1309,"DOCTOR: Will you listen to me, please? Stott and I came through one."
1310,It's perfectly all right if it's on the edge of a hull. All you need is
1311,a little determination. 
1312,"K9: Affirmative. Determination, master. "
1313,"DOCTOR: Good. Now, when you get through, I want you to go back to the"
1314,"demat machine set up near the Tardis, and when I whistle, you switch it"
1315,on. Right? 
1316,K9: Affirmative. 
1317,DOCTOR: Good. 
1318,ROMANA: What about you? You're not going to be here when the power unit
1319,"comes on, are you? "
1320,"DOCTOR: No, no. I'm going to rig myself a little time device. Could I"
1321,"borrow your watch, please? "
1322,(The Doctor takes the timepiece from Stott's wrist.) 
1323,STOTT: Certainly. 
1324,"DOCTOR: Good. Is that on ship's time? Right. Now, I'll give you till"
1325,20-25 to reach the bridge and put the power on. I'll set my device so I
1326,can escape in good time. 
1327,ROMANA: What about the mandrels? You won't have K9 or a gun. 
1328,DOCTOR: I'll have to use my wits. Off you go. Take care. Look out for
1329,excisemen. I don't think they like us very much. Off you go then. 
1330,"(Stott, Romana and K9 leave.) "
1331,DOCTOR: Twenty oh one. 
1332, [By the lift] 
1333, (Fisk has assembled all four of the ship's crew to
1334,give them his orders.) 
1335,FISK: I want this ship searched from top to bottom. If you see the
1336,"Doctor or his lady companion, arrest them. If they resist, kill them."
1337,"Right, get on with it. "
1338,(Fisk gets into the lift.) 
1339, [By the airlock] 
1340, DYMOND: Shall I put it on destruct? 
1341,TRYST: I think not. We'll see how things develop. We'll keep in touch. 
1342, [Eden] 
1343, (Roar!) 
1344,ROMANA: Look out! 
1345,"(Stott shoots at the mandrel, making it stagger just enough for them to"
1346,run past and away. Then it collapses.)

1348, (The Doctor has taken Stott's watch apart and is
1349,"putting pieces into the control unit. Behind him, the 'dead' mandrel"
1350,stirs. The time is 20:16.) 
1351,DOCTOR: Plenty of time. 
1352,(The Doctor bends down for a piece of equipment just as the mandrel
1353,takes a swipe at him. 
1354,(K9 enters the interface.) 
1355, [Eden] 
1356, ROMANA: You go back and guide the Doctor through. 
1357,STOTT: What about the excisemen? 
1358,ROMANA: I'll manage. 
1359,STOTT: Right. 
1360,(Stott turns back. Romana runs out of the projection and through the
1361,lounge. 
1362, [Power unit] 
1363, (The Doctor slips through a gap between two
1364,control units which is too small for the mandrel to follow. He goes
1365,"back behind the units to where he was working, gives it a final blast"
1366,of sonic screwdriver then switches on the countdown. The ticking
1367,attracts the mandrel.) 
1368,DOCTOR: No! No! 
1369,(The mandrel smashes the annoying timer. The flash and bang finally
1370,kills it. The Doctor stares as the creature crumbles into a heap of
1371,steaming powder.) 
1372,DOCTOR: Vraxoin. Of course! So that's it. 
1373, [First class corridor] 
1374, (Romana ducks out of sight into a cloakroom when
1375,she hears voices approaching.) 
1376,COSTA: How much longer do we have to stay up here? 
1377,FISK: Until the job's finished. How many casualties so far? 
1378,"COSTA: Here's the list. Twelve dead, twenty nine injured. Enough for a"
1379,small war. 
1380,FISK: You know what this means? 
1381,(Costa uses a drinks dispenser in the wall opposite the cloakroom.) 
1382,COSTA: What? 
1383,FISK: Almost certain promotion. 
1384,COSTA: Promotion? 
1385,"FISK: It's bound to be, a situation as big as this. It'll sort itself"
1386,"out and in the end we'll have two tailor-made suspects, the Doctor and"
1387,the girl. We'll be the golden boys of the day. 
1388,COSTA: We don't actually know anything about those two. 
1389,FISK: You found the traces of Vrax in the Doctor's pocket. What more do
1390,you want? 
1391,(Fisk and Costa move off towards the lounge. Romana comes out of hiding
1392,and heads carefully for the bridge.)

1395,Tardis door wide open.)

1399,controls that the mandrel caused.)

1402," (Rigg is there, and coming down from his high with"
1403,a crash.) 
1404,ROMANA: The Doctor's got into the power unit. 
1405,"RIGG: Good, good. "
1406,ROMANA: We're going to separate the ships now. 
1407,RIGG: Have you got something for me? Something I need? 
1408,"ROMANA: I must put full power on. Please, let me pass, Captain. "
1409,"RIGG: I must have something for this terrible feeling, don't you"
1410,understand? 
1411,ROMANA: I haven't got anything. 
1412,"RIGG: You're lying. I know you've got the stuff, now tell me where it"
1413,is. 
1414,"ROMANA: Please, let me just set the controls and I'll help you. Now let"
1415,me go. 
1416,"RIGG: I don't care about the stupid ship, woman. I want something for"
1417,"this feeling! Now you can help me. Please, I'll give you money. I've"
1418,got money. How much? How much? 
1419,"ROMANA: Let me just get the ship operating, and then I'll see that you"
1420,get medical help. 
1421,RIGG: Just a little bit. I know you've got it. Now let me have some or
1422,I'll kill you! 
1423,ROMANA: I haven't got anything! 
1424,(Rigg tries to hit her. She ducks under his arm and runs for the
1425,control console. He grabs her wrist as she reaches for the button.
1426,20:23. The Doctor is sweating as he works.) 
1427,RIGG: Give it to me! 
1428,(Fisk shoots Rigg.) 
1429,"ROMANA: Oh, thank you. He was going to kill me. "
1430,"FISK: Well it wouldn't have mattered much, since you're going to die"
1431,anyway. Trafficking in drugs is punishable by death on Azure. 
1432,ROMANA: Whereas bureaucratic murder is rewarded with promotion. 
1433,"FISK: I didn't invent the rules, I just enforce them. Don't touch those"
1434,controls. 
1435,ROMANA: But you don't understand. The Doctor is in the power unit.
1436,We're going to separate the ships now. I must operate the drive. 
1437,"FISK: I don't know what you're up to, but I intend to stop you. Touch"
1438,those controls and I shoot! 
1439,ROMANA: I thought you were going to kill me anyway. 
1440,FISK: Don't touch them! 
1441,(20:24. The Doctor has finished and put the toothpick in place. He
1442,blows his dog whistle. K9 switches on the demat machine which sends a
1443,beam into the blurred area. 20:25. Romana hits the power control.
1444,Everything shimmers and the Doctor runs out of the Power unit into a
1445,"blurred area, and disappears.) "

1449, (The two ships are separated. Romana picks herself
1450,"up from the floor. Fisk is still down, so she kicks his gun out of his"
1451,hand and runs out. Fisk is about to follow when - ) 
1452,"DYMOND : He's done it! Empress, this is Hecate. Full"
1453,"separation has been achieved. No damage to report. Empress, this is"
1454,Hecate. Respond please. 
1455,"FISK: I read you, Dymond. What are you doing on your ship? "
1456,DYMOND : I came aboard to get a couple of GP guns to help
1457,against the mandrels. The ships separated whilst I was here. 
1458,"FISK: Yeah, right. I'll check the Empress for damage. "
1459,(He punches a row of buttons.) 
1460,FISK: Good as new. 
1461,"DYMOND : Waterguard Fisk, sir. I request your permission to"
1462,continue my journey. I will not be pressing any claim on the Empress. 
1463,"FISK: No, no, no, no. I might need you as a witness. There's bound to"
1464,be an enquiry. 
1465,DYMOND : But if I delay my departure for even an hour I'll
1466,lose my contract! 
1467,"FISK: Look, Dymond, I haven't raised this with you before, but now I'm"
1468,"telling you officially. When this accident occurred, you, as Rigg"
1469,"rightly pointed out, was in a prohibited area. Now that makes you"
1470,"liable to at least a considerable fine. Now, if you try to get away,"
1471,"I'll nail a writ to your bulkhead! Do you understand, Dymond? "
1472,DYMOND : Yes. 
1473,FISK: Right. Come back aboard as quick as you can. 
1474,"DYMOND : Yes, right away. "
1475, [By the Tardis] 
1476," K9: Operation one hundred percent successful,"
1477,mistress. 
1478,"ROMANA: Yes, I know, but I can't find the Doctor. Can you locate him,"
1479,K9? 
1480,K9: Affirmative. Sensors indicate that the master is not aboard the
1481,"ship, mistress. "
1482,ROMANA: What! 
1483,(The Doctor is lying unconscious in a dark room.) 
1484, [Sickbay] 
1485, (An injured passenger is wheeled into the room
1486,opposite the Tardis. Romana enters.) 
1487,"ROMANA: Della, have you seen the Doctor? "
1488,"DELLA: No, I've been too busy with the casualties. The Excisemen want"
1489,"him shot on sight, and you. "
1490,"ROMANA: Yes, I know. I wonder, could you bare to talk about Stott? "
1491,DELLA: Why? 
1492,"ROMANA: Well, Tryst told us that you and he might be implicated in the"
1493,"drug smuggling. Now, we know it's not you and Stott, but it would help"
1494,if you could tell me what happened. 
1495,DELLA: All right. Stott and I were together. He was acting very
1496,strangely. He kept telling me to go back to the shuttle. I could see he
1497,"was worried. There were mandrels prowling about, but I know it wasn't"
1498,that. He was looking for someone. 
1499,ROMANA: For whom? Did he say? 
1500,DELLA: No. Then it happened. A shot came from the forest. He was only
1501,"stunned, but a mandrel came out from behind. I ran. I ran. I couldn't"
1502,"help myself, I just ran. I was so afraid. "
1503,"ROMANA: It's all right, Della. Anyone would have done the same. "
1504,DELLA: The mandrel killed him. 
1505,ROMANA: How do you know? 
1506,DELLA: Tryst told me. He showed me a visprint. It was horrible. 
1507,ROMANA: Stott didn't die. He's here on this ship. 
1508,DELLA: What? He can't 
1509,ROMANA: He is. 
1510,DELLA: But where? I must see him. 
1511,"ROMANA: Not yet. Now, we must find out who is smuggling the Vraxoin. We"
1512,know it's something to do with the Eden projection. Stott may be able
1513,to help us. 
1514,"DELLA: I knew it was him looking at me. In the Eden picture, someone"
1515,"staring out, only I couldn't believe it. I thought I was seeing a"
1516,"ghost. Romana, what can I do to help? "
1517,"ROMANA: First of all, we'd better find the Doctor. "
1518, [Hecate] 
1519, (The Doctor wakes up. The first thing he inspects
1520,is a wicked looking free standing laser-like device.) 
1521,DOCTOR: How very odd. How very strange. 
1522,(He looks out of the porthole to see the Empress a short distance
1523,away.) 
1524,DOCTOR: How very clever. 
1525,"(He hides as Dymond enters. Dymond uses a small keyboard, smiles at the"
1526,"results on the screen, and leaves again. The Doctor crawls over and"
1527,calls up the results again. Eden Project: projected turnover Gal
1528,"Credits: z13,000,000. Overheads z3,900,000. Profit margin: 9,100,000.) "
1529,DOCTOR: The profits on human suffering. 
1530,"(The Doctor leaves that room, and ducks behind a bank of equipment as"
1531,Dymond goes past. He tiptoes through the airlock where Dymond is
1532,"suiting up again, and gets into the back of the shuttle. Dymond gets in"
1533,and plugs his helmet into the shuttle air supply. The Doctor puts
1534,himself into suspended animation. The shuttlebay doors open and Dymond
1535,"flies back to the Empress, as promised to Fisk.) "
1536, [Empress bridge] 
1537," FISK: Right. Dymond's on his way. Now, any sign of"
1538,the Doctor? 
1539,COSTA: No. They're searching A deck at the moment. 
1540,TRYST: I think I know where the Doctor went. 
1541,FISK: Where? Why didn't you say so before? 
1542,TRYST: You may find it hard to believe. 
1543,"FISK: Make me believe, professor. "
1544,TRYST: I think he went into the projection. 
1545,FISK: What projection? 
1546,TRYST: The CET machine. The image has become an unstable dimensional
1547,field. 
1548,"FISK: Oh. If he went into it, he's got to come out the same way. Costa,"
1549,check the guard on the lounge. 
1550,COSTA: Right. 
1551,FISK: I'll join you later. 
1552,(Costa leaves.) 
1553,"FISK: Tryst, what would the Doctor want inside the projection? "
1554,TRYST: I can only imagine that one of the crew of my expedition found a
1555,"new source of this er, what is this thing called? "
1556,FISK: Vrax. 
1557,"TRYST: Ja, Vrax. Yes, Vrax, and placed it in the transmute location."
1558,"Yes, then he informed the Doctor. So the Doctor comes on board and"
1559,"makes the pick-up, which fits in with your own wonderful theory, does"
1560,it not? 
1561,"FISK: Yes, yes. Only, why did he bother to separate the ships? "
1562,"TRYST: Perhaps it's because, as you say, he is a criminal. "
1563,FISK: That would be it. 
1564, [By the Tardis] 
1565, (Della comes running up.) 
1566,ROMANA: Did you find anything? 
1567,DELLA: Only a mandrel. 
1568,"ROMANA: Oh, he must be somewhere. "
1569,"K9: Negative, mistress. I have scanned the ship and I detect no "
1570,(K9's 'ears' whirr.) 
1571,"ROMANA: What is it, K9? "
1572,K9: This way. The Doctor has just come aboard. 
1573, [Outside the airlock] 
1574," (Dymond's shuttle has docked, and Dymond heads for"
1575,"the lift. Romana, K9 and Della hide round the corner.) "
1576,"DOCTOR: Hello, K9. "
1577,"ROMANA: Hello, Doctor. "
1578,"DOCTOR: Hello, Romana. Everything all right? "
1579,ROMANA: What happened to you? 
1580,DOCTOR: I got caught in the interface when the two ships separated.
1581,"Hello, Della. "
1582,(The lift arrives.) 
1583,DOCTOR: Look out! Quick! 
1584,(Two armed crewmen are there. One catches Della but the other is
1585,stunned by K9 as the Doctor and Romana duck into the stairwell. K9
1586,leaves. The crewman checks on his fallen colleague then returns to
1587,Della.) 
1588,CREWMAN: What were you doing with them? 
1589,DELLA: Finding out a few things. 
1590,"CREWMAN: Well, you'd better tell Fisk about it. Come on. "
1591,(The Doctor and Romana return.) 
1592,"DOCTOR: Bit uncivil of them, pointing their guns at us like that. "
1593,ROMANA: They've had orders to shoot. 
1594,"DOCTOR: Yes. Tell me, what would you use an inchuka laser for? "
1595,ROMANA: An inchuka laser can be used to carry thousands of telecom
1596,messages 
1597,DOCTOR: Shush. Could it carry a CET projection crystal? 
1598,"ROMANA: From what I've seen of Tryst's set up, I should think so. Why? "
1599,DOCTOR: Because Dymond's got a CET projection machine aboard the Hecate
1600,with an inchuka laser attached. 
1601,ROMANA: Then Tryst and Dymond are the smugglers? 
1602,DOCTOR: It looks like it. The only way of convincing Fisk is to catch
1603,them in the act of transferring the Vraxoin. 
1604,"K9: Master, detect units approaching. "
1605,"(It is Stott, backing away as he fires at a mandrel.) "
1606,"DOCTOR: Stott, leave it to K9! "
1607,(K9 zaps the creature to the floor.) 
1608,"STOTT: What happened to you, Doctor? "
1609,DOCTOR: Never mind about us. We know who the smugglers are. 
1610,STOTT: Who? 
1611,"DOCTOR: Dymond's the pick-up man, and the smuggler's Tryst himself. "
1612,STOTT: Tryst? 
1613,DOCTOR: Yes. The Vraxoin's kept on the Eden crystal. They're about to
1614,transfer that crystal to the Hecate. 
1615,STOTT: Do you know what the source is? 
1616,ROMANA: Yes. Those things. 
1617,STOTT: The mandrels? 
1618,DOCTOR: Yes. One of them attacked me in the Power unit. Poor thing was
1619,"electrocuted, burnt to a powder. "
1620,STOTT: A powder? You mean? 
1621,DOCTOR: Vraxoin. 
1622,STOTT: No wonder I couldn't find it. 
1623,DOCTOR: Yes. They can make the transference across space by means of
1624,the inchuka laser. 
1625,STOTT: Can you prove it? 
1626,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1627,STOTT: How? 
1628,DOCTOR: I let them do it. 
1629, [Empress bridge] 
1630, (Della's crewman escort is grabbed by a mandrel
1631,out in the corridor. She screams and runs into the bridge where Tryst
1632,is putting on a spacesuit like Dymond's.) 
1633,"DELLA: Tryst, there's a mandrel out there! "
1634,"TRYST: It's all right, Della. Dymond has a gun. "
1635,"DELLA: What are you doing, Tryst? You weren't thinking of leaving the"
1636,"ship, were you? You've got to help the Doctor. You knew the CET was"
1637,unstable so it's all your fault. You must help them get the mandrels
1638,back into the projection. 
1639,TRYST: Is that what he's doing? 
1640,DELLA: Yes! 
1641,"TRYST: Good. In that case, I'm right behind him. "
1642, [Lounge] 
1643, (The Doctor is examining the CET machine when
1644,"Costa and two crewmen burst through the main door, and Fisk in from the"
1645,washroom with anther two. The Eden projection is running.) 
1646,"FISK: Put your hands up, Doctor! "
1647,"DOCTOR: You're arresting the wrong man, you know, Fisk. "
1648,"FISK: That's enough, Doctor. "
1649,STOTT: Stop! 
1650,(Stott runs out of the projection. 
1651,FISK: Who are you? Keep your hands up! 
1652,(Fisk takes Stott's proffered ID.) 
1653,STOTT: It's Tryst and Dymond you want. 
1654, [Empress bridge] 
1655," DELLA: Tryst, did you know Stott was alive? "
1656,TRYST: Alive? He can't be! 
1657,"DELLA: You fired that shot, didn't you, that last day on Eden. "
1658,"TRYST: I didn't want to, Della. He forced the situation on himself. "
1659,DELLA: You! You're smuggling the Vrax. 
1660,"TRYST: Della, I, er "
1661,DELLA: Yes is the word you're looking for. 
1662,"TRYST: No, it started just as a little thing, just to help me over a"
1663,"slight financial difficulty. The cost of the expedition, that was"
1664,bankrupting me! 
1665,DELLA: But Vrax is destroying people by the millions! 
1666,"TRYST: I had to continue my research! Without me, many of those"
1667,creatures would have become extinct! 
1668,DELLA: I think a few million people becoming extinct is rather more
1669,serious. 
1670,"TRYST: Ah, but they had a choice. It was their own fault that they"
1671,became addicted. 
1672,"DELLA: Huh! Like Rigg, I suppose. Did he have a choice or was he"
1673,tricked? 
1674,TRYST: That was unfortunate. 
1675,DYMOND: But necessary. 
1676,(A mandrel enters. Della escapes.) 
1677,"TRYST: No, don't kill him! He's valuable! "
1678,"DYMOND: Tryst, I can't even stop it! "
1679,(Finally the mandrel collapses.) 
1680,TRYST: Della! Get after her. 
1681,(Dymond runs out. Tryst shoots the main ship's control console and
1682,follows.) 
1683, [First class corridor] 
1684, (Della arrives at the body of the crewman. The
1685,mandrel is still there in a doorway. Dymond comes up from behind and
1686,"shoots Della, then K9 and Romana come round the corner.) "
1687,"ROMANA: Stop him, K9, quickly! "
1688,(Romana goes to help Della and K9 goes round the next corner.) 
1689,"K9: Mission aborted, mistress. "
1690,(The mandrel comes out of the doorway and threatens Romana. K9 shoots
1691,it.) 
1692,"K9: More important to protect you as programmed, mistress. "
1693,"ROMANA: Thank you, K9. That was close. "
1694,"K9: Two metres, to be precise, mistress. "
1695,(The Doctor comes running up.) 
1696,"DOCTOR: Romana, what happened? "
1697,"ROMANA: Dymond shot Della. She's wounded, but she'll be all right. "
1698,DOCTOR: The callous wretches. They'll be making the transfer to the
1699,Hecate by now. 
1700, [Outside the shuttlebay] 
1701, FISK : All personnel locate and apprehend
1702,passenger Tryst and pilot Dymond. They may try to leave the ship. And
1703,"with reference to the previous order regarding the Doctor, cancel it. "
1704,TRYST: Is sooner than I thought. 
1705,DYMOND: Better move. They'll have an interceptor after us. 
1706,TRYST: I think not. I smashed the communications system. They're cut
1707,off from Azure. 
1708, [Empress bridge] 
1709," FISK: If we don't get them on the ship, we've lost"
1710,them. 
1711,"STOTT: The Empress is faster, isn't she? "
1712,"FISK: There's no pilot, no navigating officer. Could you fly her? "
1713,(Stott shakes his head. The Doctor enters.) 
1714,"DOCTOR: Gentlemen, once more into the "
1715,(Then he sees the destroyed communication unit.) 
1716,DOCTOR: What happened? 
1717,STOTT: Tryst and Dymond have got away. 
1718,DOCTOR: They won't go anywhere without the Eden crystal. That gives us
1719,a little time. 
1720,FISK: To do what? 
1721,"DOCTOR: Well, now that the ships are separated, we can at last"
1722,stabilise the CET properly. 
1723,FISK: Good. Isn't it? 
1724,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1725,"FISK: Yes, but what does it mean? "
1726,"DOCTOR: It means, Fisk, that we can finally clear this marauding"
1727,"menagerie back into the projection, which is exactly where Dymond will"
1728,want it. 
1729,FISK: Yes. But what are we going to do? 
1730,"DOCTOR: Give him what he wants. We have to bait the hook properly,"
1731,don't we? 
1732, [Corridor] 
1733, (Stott and a crewman use their weapons to herd a
1734,pair of mandrels along.) 
1735,STOTT: Keep them moving. We should meet up with Fisk soon. 
1736,"(Fisk, Costa and a crewman have got three more, but the crewman gets"
1737,knocked out before they can get them moving again. 
1738,"Meanwhile, Dymond's shuttle arrives back on the Hecate.) "
1739, [First class corridor] 
1740, (The two groups have met up and are nearly at the
1741,lounge.) 
1742,STOTT: The guns are fading! 
1743,(The mandrels turn and start to drive the men back. The Doctor appears
1744,and whistles to get the mandrel's attention. Then he uses the dog
1745,whistle to calm them and lure them into the lounge. Very Pied Piper of
1746,him.) 
1747, [Lounge] 
1748, (He gets them to the edge of the Eden projection.)
1749,
1750,DOCTOR: I'm going inside now and I may be rather a long time. 
1751,"(Blowing the whistle, he leads the mandrels back into Eden.) "
1752, [Eden] 
1753, (The Doctor tries to circle round and get out
1754,"again, but trips on a vine.) "
1755,"DOCTOR: Ah. Oh gosh, oh lord, oh Doctor. "
1756,(He leads them out of camera shot.) 
1757,"DOCTOR : Steady, steady. This way. Not that way! This. Oh! Oh! "
1758,(Bits of foliage come flying into shot.) 
1759,"DOCTOR : Oh, my fingers, my arms, my legs! Ah! My everything! Argh!"
1760,
1761, [Lounge] 
1762, (Fisk and Costa put away their guns.) 
1763,"FISK: It's all over, then. Switch off the machine. "
1764,ROMANA: No! 
1765,(The Doctor appears from the. His coat has been ripped to shreds with
1766,just the lining left and the arms hanging off his wrists. A mandrel
1767,appears behind him and he runs out.) 
1768,"DOCTOR: Quick, switch it off! "
1769,(Romana switches off the CET machine.) 
1770,"DOCTOR: Phew. Well done, Romana. "
1771,"FISK: Well, Doctor? "
1772,STOTT: What now? 
1773,(The Doctor takes his own pulse.) 
1774,"DOCTOR: Romana, you've got two minutes fifty eight seconds to rebuild"
1775,this machine. 
1776,"ROMANA: What, this? "
1777,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1778,ROMANA: CET? 
1779,DOCTOR: Yes! 
1780,ROMANA: Are you joking? 
1781,DOCTOR: Do I look as if I'm joking? Well? 
1782,"ROMANA: Well, I'll need a screwdriver. "
1783, [Hecate] 
1784, (Tryst is lining up the laser when Dymond enters.)
1785,
1786,DYMOND: How's the attitude setting? 
1787,TRYST: It couldn't be better. Are you ready to get us out of here as
1788,soon as I've made the transfer? 
1789,DYMOND: I can fire the engine from here. 
1790,TRYST: Good. I'm ready. 
1791,(Tryst switches on the laser.) 
1792, [Lounge] 
1793, DOCTOR: Increase the gain on the matrix modulator. Well? 
1794,ROMANA: Up five points. 
1795,DOCTOR: Five points. That's not enough. We're going to need some more
1796,power from somewhere. 
1797,ROMANA: We could put the jump leads on K9. 
1798,DOCTOR: Good. 
1799,(He just happens to have them around his neck. Romana clips them onto
1800,K9's 'ears'.) 
1801,"DOCTOR: Good dog, K9. Come on, put your leads on. Put your leads on."
1802,There. 
1803,"ROMANA: Are you connected, K9? "
1804,"K9: Affirmative, mistress. "
1805,STOTT: What are you hoping to achieve? 
1806,DOCTOR: I want to increase the range and power of this machine. How
1807,"many points now, Romana? "
1808,ROMANA: Ten and building. 
1809,DOCTOR: Ten and building. That's much better. We're going to be all
1810,right. 
1811,(Then the laser beam hits the top of the machine where the Doctor is
1812,resting his hands. He jumps.) 
1813,ROMANA: Are you all right? 
1814,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes. It was just a little shock, that's all. "
1815,ROMANA: They're making the transfer. 
1816,STOTT: That means they'll get away. 
1817,"DOCTOR: Shush! Quiet, quiet. Reverse the setting on the transmutation"
1818,"reflex. It's all right, it's all right, it's quite safe. "
1819,ROMANA: They've made the transfer. 
1820,DOCTOR: So? 
1821,ROMANA: They'll get away! 
1822,DOCTOR: Will you please reverse the setting on the transmutation
1823,reflex! 
1824,(Romana sticks the sonic screwdriver inside the CET.) 
1825,DOCTOR: K9? 
1826,"K9: Yes, master? "
1827,DOCTOR: I want you to find the Hecate. Give me her position. 
1828,K9: Affirmative. 
1829,DOCTOR: Good dog. 
1830, [Hecate] 
1831, TRYST: Good. We've done it. Let's get out of here.
1832,
1833,(Dymond fires up the Hecate's engines and she starts moving away.) 
1834, [Lounge] 
1835," K9: Forty seven point three, vector seven niner"
1836,niner in seven seconds. 
1837,DOCTOR: Forty seven point three vector seven niner niner. I hope you're
1838,"right, K9. "
1839,"(As the Doctor operates the CET machine, everything shimmers briefly.) "
1840,"DOCTOR: Well, good. "
1841,STOTT: What's happened? 
1842,"DOCTOR: Have you ever heard the expression, hoist by his own petard? "
1843,"STOTT: Yes, but you haven't done anything. "
1844,"DOCTOR: Good, well what "
1845,(The Excisemen enter.) 
1846,"FISK: So, Doctor, your plan has failed miserably. There's no way we can"
1847,catch them now. 
1848,"DOCTOR: On the contrary, Fisk. I've already caught them. There they"
1849,"are, all yours. "
1850,"(On the projection screen, Tryst and Dymond stare at them in horror.) "
1851,"FISK: But I, I "
1852,DOCTOR: All I did was increase the range of this machine and brought
1853,"them back. Matter transmutation, you see. And because the projection's"
1854,"still unstable, all you have to do is pluck them out. "
1855,FISK: You heard him. Pluck them out. 
1856,(Two crewmen fetch Tryst and Dymond out of the projection.) 
1857,"TRYST: Doctor! Doctor, I didn't want to be involved in all this. Tell"
1858,them. Tell them that I only did it for the sake of funding my research.
1859,You understand all this. You're a scientist. 
1860,DOCTOR: Go away. 
1861,TRYST: What? 
1862,DOCTOR: Go away. 
1863,TRYST: Oh! 
1864, [Outside the Tardis] 
1865," DOCTOR: Well, how are you now, Della? Good? Good? "
1866,"DELLA: I'm fine now, thank you, Doctor. I'm relieved the nightmare's"
1867,over. 
1868,"DOCTOR: The nightmare's here, on the Eden crystal. "
1869,ROMANA: And here's the rest of Tryst's electric zoo. 
1870,DELLA: It never was meant to be a zoo. It really was a conservation
1871,exercise for most of us. 
1872,DOCTOR: I think the best way of conserving the poor creatures trapped
1873,"in these crystals is to project them back to their own planets, don't"
1874,you? 
1875,DELLA: But you've dismantled the CET. 
1876,"ROMANA: Oh, we've got far more sophisticated stuff in the Tardis. Do it"
1877,in no time. 
1878,STOTT: What about the mandrels and the Vraxoin? 
1879,DOCTOR: The mandrels have a perfect right to exist. In one way Tryst
1880,was right. Humans do have some kind of choice. Let's just hope that no
1881,one else discovers the secret. 
1882,ROMANA: I can only think of one animal who'd be comfortably at home in
1883,an electric zoo. 
1884,DELLA: Really? What's that? 
1885,"ROMANA: I don't think we want to tell them, do we, K9? "
1886,"K9: Negative, mistress.  "
