21,"RYAN: So today I want to talk about the greatest woman I ever met. Smart, funny, caring, special. Proper special. "
22,"Er, where do I start? Okay, I've mentioned this on here before. I'm pretty much not an idiot. I'm actually a capable guy, considering. "
23,"But I'm 19, and cos of the thing I told you before, I can't yet ride a bike. "
24,
25,[Moors]
26,
27,"(Probably Froggatt Edge, overlooking Sheffield, home of the world's best cutlery.)"
28,GRACE: Who says you can't? 
29,"RYAN: Me, Nan. We keep trying this. "
30,GRACE: And we'll go on trying till it's done. Now keep your eye on Grandad. 
31,RYAN: You mean Graham. 
32,"GRACE: Keep your eye on Graham, then. Three, two, one, go! Go on! "
33,(She gives him a push and he peddles unsteadily along the grass towards Graham.)
34,"GRAHAM: Go on, Ryan! You're doing it, mate! "
35,(Then Ryan fall off.) 
36,GRACE: Nearly. 
37,"RYAN: No, not nearly. I'm sick of coming up here, I'm sick of falling, and I'm sick of this stupid bike. "
38,"GRACE: Ryan Sinclair, don't you dare! "
39,"(Ryan throws the bike over the cliff edge. Later, sitting on the same precipitous edge.) "
40,"GRAHAM: Mate, you rode it for a second. "
41,"RYAN: Can you stop calling me mate? Anyway, a second's not enough. "
42,"GRACE: You'll do it, if you keep on trying. "
43,RYAN: I just want to make you proud. 
44,GRACE: You make me proud every day. 
45,"GRAHAM: Anyway, you're on your own getting that bike, cos our train leaves in twenty minutes. Come on, love. "
46,"(So Ryan carefully picks his way down the slope and finds himself in what looks like Padley Gorge to me, all dank and mossy. The bike is hanging up in a tree. "
47,"There's a whoosh and lines that form a glowing diamond shape appears behind him, which multiply and rotate into smaller squares with a dot in the middle. He touches it and it "
48,"whizzes away. Then something appears in a bright light, which settles down to reveal it is blue with pock marks on it. Best way to imagine the shape is - a drop of very viscous "
49,"liquid has just touched a flat surface then hardened instantly. Once again, he touches it, then pulls his hand away in pain and gets out his phone.)"
50,"RYAN: Hi. Er, Police, maybe."
51,
52,[Street]
53,
54,(A young Police Constable approaches two squabbling women. Her attitude to policing seems to channel Sgt Cawood from Happy Valley.)
55,SONIA: She smashed it with a hammer! 
56,JANEY: Cos you keyed me nearside door! 
57,SONIA: Because you parked in my spot! 
58,JANEY: It's not your spot. There are no spots.
59,"YASMIN: Ladies, please! Thank you. Can I suggest a simple solution? You pay for her cracked window, you pay for her scratched door, "
60,and we all agree that parking round here is a nightmare but that grown-ups really shouldn't need to call the police to sort it out for them. 
61,"Now, if we're all agreed on that, there's no need for me to take any further police action and we can all get on with our lives. "
62,What do you reckon?
63,
64,[Police car / Police station]
65,
66,"YASMIN: I'm just saying, I am capable of more than parking disputes. "
67,"RAMESH: And I keep telling you don't run before you can walk. You're a probationer, Yaz. Learn the basics."
68,YASMIN: I want to do more. Can you not get them to give me something that'll test me? Something a bit different. 
69,"RAMESH: There is something that just came in, if you want different."
70,
71,[Woods]
72,
73,(Gazing at the blue thing.)
74,YASMIN: And you say you just found it here? 
75,"RYAN: No, I said it appeared, out of nowhere. "
76,YASMIN: Right. 
77,"RYAN: I swear, this isn't a prank. I came down here to get me bike. "
78,YASMIN: And where's your bike? 
79,RYAN: In that tree. 
80,"YASMIN: Name, sir? "
81,RYAN: Ryan Sinclair. 
82,YASMIN: Wait. Redlands Primary? 
83,RYAN: Yeah. 
84,YASMIN: Yasmin Khan. 
85,RYAN: Oh my God. Yaz. Wow. 
86,YASMIN: I know. 
87,RYAN: Look at you. You're a Fed. 
88,"YASMIN: Yeah. We don't call it that. I'm still training, second year probation. What about you, what are you up to?"
89,RYAN: Warehouse worker. 
90,YASMIN: Oh. Right. Like it? 
91,RYAN: Hate it. It's cash while I study for my NVQ. I'm trying to be a mechanic. 
92,"YASMIN: That's good. You have to take this away, though, seriously. It's going to be dark any minute. You can't dump this here."
93,RYAN: I didn't. I can't even lift it. 
94,"YASMIN: Oh, come on, Ryan. It's me."
95,RYAN: Touch it. 
96,YASMIN: What? 
97,(She does.) 
98,RYAN: See? It's freezing.
99,
100,[Train carriage]
101,
102,ANNOUNCEMENT: The next station is Grindleford. 
103,GRAHAM: Do you ever think he's going to call me Grandad? 
104,GRACE: Give him time. 
105,GRAHAM: Three years we've been married.
106,GRACE: And you've never been happier! 
107,"(She kisses Graham then speaks to the lad with the earbuds in across the aisle, the only other person in the carriage.)"
108,"GRACE: Can't keep his hands off me, love. "
109,GRAHAM: Behave yourself. 
110,GRACE: Never.
111,"(Up in the cab, the driver sees something sparking, then gets thrown off her 'dead man's handle'. The train comes to a sudden halt. Graham is thrown out of his seat. "
112,Then the lights go out.)
113,"GRAHAM: You all right, love? "
114,"GRACE: Think so, yeah. What just happened? "
115,GRAHAM: Where you going? 
116,GRACE: Just having a look.
117,(She puts her head out of a door to see people getting off the train.)
118,"GRACE: What're you doing? Don't go on t'track, it could be live. "
119,KARL: Get off of there! 
120,(Clang!)
121,"GRACE: Graham, the doors just locked. We're shut in. I can't get them open. Summat's wrong. "
122,KARL: I think something's coming down the train. 
123,(There's a flash of bright light from the next carriage.)
124,"GRAHAM: Right, get away from the door. Grace, get to the back of the carriage. Get to the back. "
125,(They close the interconnecting doors behind them.)
126,
127,[Woods]
128,
129,(Night has fallen. Ryan's phone rings.) 
130,"RYAN: Wait, one sec. Hiya, Nan. "
131,"GRACE : Ryan, love. Our train's stopped between Hathersage and Grindleford, and something really weird's going on. (static) "
132,YASMIN: Everything all right? 
133,RYAN: Nan? 
134,(A police car speeds down a country lane.)
135,
136,[Train carriage]
137,
138,"GRAHAM: Grace, get back. "
139,(An interconnecting door is blown apart. A multi-tentacled thing moves slowly towards them.) 
140,GRAHAM: What is it? 
141,GRACE: I've no idea. 
142,"(Electrical discharges from the thing trap them against the final and locked door. Suddenly, someone falls through the carriage roof with a cry.) "
143,DOCTOR: What? 
144,"(They point at the being behind her. She grabs a dangling electrical cable and thrusts it into the thing, which stop sparking. I think that's what she does, "
145,it's very dark then very bright and hard to tell.) 
146,"DOCTOR: Should buy us a few seconds. (looks at the hole in the roof) Oh yeah, Long story. Tell you later. Doors? "
147,GRACE: Locked shut. 
148,"DOCTOR: We'll see about that. No sonic. Empty pockets. Oh, I hate empty pockets. "
149,KARL: It's coming back! 
150,"DOCTOR: What are you? Okay, you don't like questions. More the private type, I get that. "
151,(It somehow gets Karl separated from the group.)
152,KARL: Get it away from me! 
153,"DOCTOR: All of you, stay very still. "
154,KARL: It's going to kill us. 
155,DOCTOR: It could've done that already. 
156,RYAN: Nan! 
157,"GRACE: Ryan, stay away! "
158,"YASMIN: Oh, my God. "
159,"(Electrical discharges, then it disappears through the hole in the roof.) "
160,"DOCTOR: You three, relax, but stay put. I'll check the rest of the train. Fat lot of use you two were. "
161,(Walking through the train.) 
162,"YASMIN: Hey! Hold on there please, madam. I need you to do as I say. This could be a potential crime scene. "
163,DOCTOR: Why are you calling me madam? 
164,YASMIN: Because you're a woman. 
165,DOCTOR: Am I? Does it suit me? 
166,YASMIN: What? 
167,"DOCTOR: Oh yeah, I remember. Sorry, half an hour ago I was a white-haired Scotsman. When's the next train due? "
168,RYAN: This is the last one back. 
169,DOCTOR: But the doors are locked. How did you both get in? 
170,YASMIN: Driver's window was smashed in. 
171,DOCTOR: What's your name? 
172,"YASMIN: PC Khan, Hallamshire Police."
173,"(Note to the curious, Hallamshire is the traditional name for South Yorkshire, which is now mostly Sheffield.) "
174,"DOCTOR: Name, not title. "
175,"YASMIN: Yasmin Khan. Yaz to my friends. Can I have your name, please? "
176,DOCTOR: When I can remember it. 
177,YASMIN: You don't know your own name? 
178,"DOCTOR: Course I know it. I just can't remember it. It's right there, on the tip of my... What's that? "
179,RYAN: Tongue? 
180,DOCTOR: Tongue! Smart boy. Biology. What did she call you? Ryan? 
181,RYAN: Yeah. Ryan Sinclair. 
182,"DOCTOR: Good name. Are you a doctor, Ryan? "
183,RYAN: No. 
184,DOCTOR: Shame. I'm looking for a doctor.
185,
186,[Driver's cab]
187,
188,"DOCTOR: Power, lights, doors. Poor woman. "
189,RYAN: That thing must've  killed her as it came through. 
190,DOCTOR: Must it? It didn't kill anyone else. Looks more like she died of shock when it smashed through the window. 
191,"YASMIN: Either way, a woman has died here. "
192,"DOCTOR: But no more creatures, and no other passengers left on board. Let's get back to the others. "
193,
194,[Train carriage]
195,
196,"YASMIN: Wait. Can you stop, please? This could be a major incident. I'm the one in charge here. "
197,DOCTOR: What are you going to do? 
198,YASMIN: Call it in to my station.
199,DOCTOR: What are you going to tell them? 
200,YASMIN: The facts. 
201,DOCTOR: Which are? 
202,YASMIN: The train was attacked. 
203,DOCTOR: By what? 
204,YASMIN: I need to take a look at CCTV footage. 
205,DOCTOR: And why do you need to check CCTV when we all saw it with our own eyes? 
206,RYAN: Was it an alien? Because it looked like an alien to me. 
207,"YASMIN: Oh, come on. "
208,"DOCTOR: What, you think he's wrong? "
209,"YASMIN: No, I dunno, but... "
210,DOCTOR: But you're worried about how you'll explain all this to a superior officer who won't believe you. 
211,YASMIN: I can't not report it. 
212,DOCTOR: You could hold off until we get the answers to the bigger questions. 
213,YASMIN: Which are? 
214,"DOCTOR: What was it? Why is it here? Where's it going next? And, most importantly, how do we stop it? 'Cos whatever it is, I don't think it's done. "
215,"Come on, Ryan. Come on, Yaz. I'm calling you Yaz, cos we're friends now. "
216,"(Later, Yasmin is taking witness details.) "
217,KARL: It's er Karl Wright. Middle name's Brian. 52 Northover Street. 
218,YASMIN: Telephone number? 
219,"DOCTOR: Right then, troops. No, not troops. Team, gang, fam? I'm distracting myself. "
220,GRACE: You came crashing through that roof. 
221,"DOCTOR: I was thrown out of my Tardis. Oh, I've lost my Tardis. It was exploding and then it dematerialised. Don't panic. Not the end of the world. "
222,"Well, it could be the end of the world, but one thing at a time. "
223,GRAHAM: Are we supposed to understand anything you're saying? 
224,RYAN: She thinks that thing is an alien. 
225,"GRAHAM: Don't be daft. There's no such thing as aliens. Anyway even if there was, they ain't going to be on a train in Sheffield. "
226,DOCTOR: Why not? I'm alien and I'm here. 
227,"GRAHAM: Grace, we're going. "
228,"GRACE: No, we're not. She just saved our lives. "
229,"DOCTOR: Don't be scared. All of this is new to you, and new can be scary. Now we all want answers. Stick with me, you might get some. "
230,"KARL: Actually, I don't want answers. I just want to get to work and forget all about this. If that's all right with everyone. Even if it isn't. Thank you. "
231,YASMIN: Would you like me to... 
232,"KARL: No! Thank you. I er, just want to be on my own. I'll walk. I need the air. And I'm with him. We don't get aliens in Sheffield. "
233,"GRACE: I think he's still in shock, bless him. "
234,"DOCTOR: Obvious question, but has anyone noticed anything else out of the ordinary tonight? "
235,(Ryan slowly raises his hand.)
236,
237,[Police car]
238,
239,YASMIN: I'm going to be in such trouble if they find out I were there. 
240,DOCTOR: Can we have the lights and siren on? 
241,YASMIN: No! I shouldn't be doing any of this. 
242,DOCTOR: So you three know each other?
243,GRACE: I'm his Nan. Graham's me husband. 
244,RYAN: Second husband. 
245,DOCTOR: And you two know each other? 
246,"RYAN: Yeah, Yaz and I were at school together.  "
247,DOCTOR: Oh. 
248,GRACE: Not Yasmin Khan? 
249,"YASMIN: Hello, Ryan's Nan."
250,"GRACE: Haven't you done well for yourself, love. "
251,"DOCTOR: And you say you just found it there, this thing? "
252,"RYAN: Yeah, pretty much. I took pictures. "
253,"DOCTOR: Oh, good lad. (looks at the pictures) That's exciting. No, not exciting. What do I mean? Worrying. Fast as you can, Yaz."
254,
255,[Woods]
256,
257,RYAN: There's my bike. 
258,DOCTOR: Why's it in a tree? 
259,RYAN: We were up top and I chucked it over. 
260,GRAHAM: He gets cross cos he can't ride it. 
261,GRACE: We're giving him lessons. He's got dyspraxia. It's a coordination disorder. 
262,"RYAN: Anyway, enough about me. The tree's to the left so it should be... "
263,YASMIN: It was definitely there. 
264,DOCTOR: So where's it gone? 
265,(White van man has it.)
266,
267,[Industrial unit]
268,
269,(Two men have unloaded the thing safely.) 
270,"ANDY: Rahul, if you're right about that, should we not tell someone? "
271,RAHUL: What good would that do? 
272,"ANDY: I'm worried for you, mate. "
273,"RAHUL: I've finally got it. Go on, mate, have a pint on me. I'll see you Monday. Pick you up at eight. "
274,"(Andy leaves. Rahul tapes video cameras to concrete posts around the thing, then sits down to watch it.)"
275,
276,[Sheffield]
277,
278,"DOCTOR: Two weird things, one city, same night, makes me nervous. "
279,YASMIN: I'll see if there have been any more reports on that object. 
280,"DOCTOR: Good, cos we need all the information we can get. Meet us back here. "
281,"GRAHAM: I could have a word with some of my old pals from work. If you want to know what's happening, ask a bus driver. "
282,RYAN: He always says that.  
283,"GRAHAM: Yeah, that's cos it is true. I'd still be doing it now if I could. "
284,RYAN: I can search for weird stuff on social media. 
285,GRACE: I'll check in with my nurses group on WhatsApp. 
286,GRAHAM: Seriously though. Aliens?  
287,DOCTOR: Yep. 
288,"GRAHAM: Yeah, maybe I won't mention that bit. "
289,DOCTOR: Suddenly I feel really tired. 
290,"GRACE: That was a big fall you had, love. We should get you checked out at A&E. "
291,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. I never go anywhere that's just initials. Although... (sticks a finger up her nostril) Ah. Can one of you catch me? "
292,RYAN: You're going to fall over? 
293,"DOCTOR: In 2 minutes, 19 seconds. Wait. Forget the 2 minutes 19. Oh, this new nose is so unreliable. "
294,(She falls into Ryan's arms.)
295,
296,[Police station]
297,
298,"RAMESH: Yaz, you've done your shift. Stop pestering me for more interesting shouts. "
299,YASMIN: It's not that. I'm just wondering whether there's been anything else out of the ordinary tonight. 
300,RAMESH: It's the night shift in Sheffield. Everything's out of the ordinary.
301,
302,[Bus station]
303,
304,"GRAHAM: I've got to ask you, any talk of weird stuff or strange creatures out tonight? "
305,"GABRIEL: My wife's out with her mates at karaoke, if that's what you mean. "
306,(The men laugh.) 
307,"GRAHAM: Yeah, yeah."
308,
309,[Ryan's home]
310,
311,"GRACE: Ryan, look. "
312,(The Doctor is spark out on the sofa. Amazing how the suit regenerated too to fit her so well. Regeneration energy is still coursing through her veins.) 
313,RYAN: Whoa. 
314,GRACE: She's got two separate pulses. 
315,(A piece of golden energy floats away from her.) 
316,"RYAN: Oh my God, what is that? "
317,GRACE: I have no idea. 
318,"(Over in Rahul's industrial unit, the lights flicker, then the flask thing cracks. Steam rises and yellow light streams out. "
319,"On a rooftop, the multi-tentacled thing scans the city. Rahul's video cameras burst in to flames and he leaps back, crowbar at the ready to defend himself. "
320,"The Doctor wakes up, gasping.) "
321,"DOCTOR: Ah! Ah! Oh! Who woke me up? I'm not ready, still healing, still... oh. Can you smell that? No, not smell, not hear, feel. Can you feel...? "
322,"Stay still, Ryan. "
323,RYAN: What is it? What's the matter? 
324,DOCTOR: Ah. Show me your collarbones. 
325,(Little red lights flickering by their clavicles.) 
326,"DOCTOR: Oh, you've all got them.  "
327,RYAN: So have you. 
328,"DOCTOR: Yeah, I have. Okay. Really sorry. Not good news. DNA bombs. Micro-implants which code to your DNA. On detonation, they disrupt the foundation of your genetic code, "
329,melting your DNA. Fast and nasty and outlawed in every civilised galaxy. 
330,RYAN: How did we get them? 
331,"GRAHAM: Never mind that, are they going to go off?  "
332,"DOCTOR: Quiet, I'm trying to think. It's difficult. I'm not yet who I am. Brain and body still rebooting, reformatting.  "
333,(Sees the picture of the thing on the train on Ryan's phone.) 
334,"DOCTOR: Oh, reformatting. Can I borrow that? "
335,"RYAN: Yeah, I guess so. But what for? "
336,"DOCTOR: That creature, on the train when you two came on board, it zapped us all with these. Simple plan to take out witnesses. Very clever. Merciless, but clever. "
337,I reformatted your phone. 
338,RYAN: No! All my stuff's on there! 
339,DOCTOR: Not any more. 
340,(The Doctor triggers her new app and is thrown backwards into the wall.) 
341,"DOCTOR: Oh! That nap did me the world of good. Very comfy sofa. (grabs her jacket) Come on, keep up."
342,
343,[Industrial unit]
344,
345,(A bipedal metal-clad creature stands up.) 
346,RAHUL: Where's my sister? 
347,TZIM-SHA: Ask me again. 
348,RAHUL: Where's my sister? 
349,TZIM-SHA: You will never know. 
350,(It puts its gauntlet on Rahul's head and he screams.)
351,
352,[Car]
353,
354,DOCTOR: Next left. 
355,YASMIN: Where are we driving to? 
356,RYAN: I reckon she's using my phone to track the origin signal for the DNA bombs. 
357,"GRAHAM: Again, how long till they go off?  "
358,DOCTOR: Don't know. 
359,"GRAHAM: Well, can't we just defuse them? "
360,DOCTOR: Not without the right equipment. Left again. 
361,(The elderly Volvo comes to a halt in the industrial unit area. They all get out.) 
362,
363,[Business park]
364,
365,DOCTOR: We're close. 
366,(Explosion a little way off.) 
367,DOCTOR: Bingo. Oi! 
368,(The metal man appears.) 
369,DOCTOR: I was expecting a tentacle-y thing. (shouts) Don't you move! 
370,"(It turns away, she chases after it.) "
371,"RYAN: Wait, is that another alien? "
372,GRACE: Looks like it! 
373,(They chase after the Doctor.) 
374,GRAHAM: Why is she running at another alien? 
375,"YASMIN: Don't just stand there, come on! "
376,GRAHAM: Now you're all running at it! 
377,(Further on.) 
378,"DOCTOR: Oh, lost it. It's fast. I'm slower cos of all this... fizzing inside. "
379,RYAN: In here!
380,
381,[Industrial unit]
382,
383,GRAHAM: Got a man down over here. 
384,GRACE: That thing must've killed him. I've never seen injuries like these. 
385,"DOCTOR: Not a weapon blast, more of an ice burn. "
386,GRACE: It broke his jaw open too. 
387,DOCTOR: Looks like it took one of his teeth. 
388,What sort of creature kills someone and then stops to pull out a tooth? I'm sorry you all had to see this. 
389,GRACE: I'll find something to cover the body. 
390,"DOCTOR: Thank you, Grace. I'm sorry any of this is happening. I'm sorry that thing on the train planted these bombs inside you, and I'm sorry I haven't figured out "
391,what's going on yet. 
392,RYAN: This is it. This is the thing.  
393,YASMIN: It was all sealed up earlier. Looks like it's been broken. 
394,"DOCTOR: Or it's done what it came here for. It's some sort of transport chamber, presumably for that thing we just saw in the alley. "
395,But why here? Why tonight? 
396,"RYAN: Actually, that might have been me. "
397,DOCTOR: Why? What did you do? 
398,"RYAN: When I went to get me bike, there were this line in the air. And then it moved, and there were shapes.  "
399,DOCTOR: And? 
400,RYAN: And I touched one.  
401,GRACE: Ryan. 
402,RYAN: You all would've done the same. 
403,GRAHAM: I wouldn't. 
404,DOCTOR: I would've. 
405,"RYAN: Right, the shapes disappeared. A few seconds later, that appeared. What've I done? "

411,"RYAN: All right, I made a mistake. But why did that guy move this thing from the Peaks to here? And how did he even know it were there? "
412,DOCTOR: Good questions. 
413,"YASMIN: Let's take a look round here, see what we can find. "
414,"DOCTOR: Can't follow it. The tracking's been blocked, like it figured out what I was doing. "
415,"GRACE: If we were tracking bomb signals from that creature from t'train, why did they lead us here? "
416,"DOCTOR: Another good question. I dunno. If I could analyse that. Course, what I really need is my... Oh! I could build one  I'm good at building things. Probably. "
417,(Runs off.) 
418,"YASMIN: It's not your fault, all this. "

421,RYAN: Maybe tell Graham that. 
422,"YASMIN: He knows, really. Do you believe she's an alien? "

528,TZIM-SHA: Well done. Your tiny mind must be burning with such effort. 
529,DOCTOR: Did he just say I had a small mind? 
530,"TZIM-SHA: The challenge is simple. Our leaders randomly designate a selected human. I'm sent here, alone, no weapons, no assistance. "
531,"I must locate and obtain the trophy and return home with it, victorious. By doing this, I ascend to leader. This is the ritual of the Stenza. "

534,TZIM-SHA: Access was granted.

536,"DOCTOR: Just to pick up on one thing. You don't mind, do you? You said the rules were no weapons, no assistance.  "
537,TZIM-SHA: Correct.

539,"TZIM-SHA: We Stenza live at temperatures far below this planet, one touch of my cold skin will kill a human. "
540,"DOCTOR: So, this super-powered Gathering Coil right here, you're not meant to have it, are you? "
541,TZIM-SHA: The creature is irrelevant. 
542,DOCTOR: I don't think it is. I think you smuggled it ahead of you. I think it located the randomly designated human for you. I think you broke the rules.

798,"GRAHAM: Lots of you knew Grace longer than me, so I can't stand here and pretend to know everything about her. I wasn't her first husband, "
799,"but she said I would do for a second attempt. I can only tell you about the Grace I met, when I thought I didn't have much time left. "
800,"The... the Grace that showed me life had more to offer, and... And I know if she was here now, she'd tell us not to be so sad. "
801,"You see, I can hear her saying to me, Graham, we had three glorious years, what're you complaining about? I'm complaining because I wanted more. "
802,"You see, Grace was a better person than I could ever be. And I should have gone and... Grace should still be here."
803,
804,[Outside Ryan's home]
805,
806,"DOCTOR: What did you mean in your speech, you thought you'd run out of time?  "
807,"GRAHAM: Oh, well, er, I had cancer and er... Well, strictly speaking, I'm still in remission, three years gone. And Grace was my chemo nurse. "
808,"That's where we met and fell in love. So by rights, I shouldn't even be here. "
809,YASMIN: Have you got family? 
810,DOCTOR: No. Lost them a long time ago. 
811,RYAN: How do you cope with that? 
812,"DOCTOR: I carry them with me. What they would've thought and said and done. I make them a part of who I am. So even though they're gone from the world, "
813,they're never gone from me. 
814,GRAHAM: That's the sort of thing Grace would have said. 
815,"YASMIN: So everything we saw, everything we've lied to people about, is this normal for you? "
816,"DOCTOR: I'm just a traveller. Sometimes I see things need fixing, I do what I can. Except right now, I'm a traveller without a ship. I've stayed too long. "
817,I should get back to finding my Tardis. 
818,"YASMIN: Doctor. Can I just say, you really need to get out of those clothes. "
819,"DOCTOR: Right, yeah. It's been a long time since I bought women's clothes."
820,
821,[Charity shop]
822,
823,(Lots of stuff being thrown out from behind the changing room curtain.) 
824,"DOCTOR : Not that. Not that, not that. Ah, not that. Oh! Yes! Now, that's what I want. "
825,"(She comes out wearing a really weird ensemble of a top with two horizontal stripes across her biggest part, a pair of half-mast flares held up by braces, "
826,"and a pale grey long coat with hood. Still in the Doc Martens, though.) "
827,YASMIN: That's what you're going with? 
828,"DOCTOR: Yep! Got any cash? Empty pockets. Also, I've been thinking about my Tardis. So you think you guys might be able to help me?"
829,
830,[Industrial unit]
831,
832,(The Doctor is putting the final touches to a very Heath-Robinson lash-up. Graham is clutching a car battery.) 
833,GRAHAM: How long have we got to stand here for? I'm getting cramp. 
834,"DOCTOR: Seriously, Graham, trying to concentrate here. "
835,RYAN: Do you understand what she's doing? 
836,DOCTOR: My ship uses a particular type of energy. I've tracked that energy trail from the moment I lost it to where it is now. 
837,"Now, given this is a transport pod, I'm configuring it to send me to the planet where my ship seems to have ended up. "
838,YASMIN: You're going to another planet? 
839,"DOCTOR: Well, trying to. Except Stenza technology's really annoying and super hard to decipher. 139 layers, seven of which don't make sense. "
840,Right. Graham. 
841,GRAHAM: Yeah? 
842,DOCTOR: Clamp those onto there. 
843,(Crocodile clips onto the battery terminals.) 
844,GRAHAM: All right.  
845,"DOCTOR: Yaz, thread the cable onto the top. Ryan, you turn on the switch. Okay, you three, I'm almost gonna miss ya. "
846,(A microwave beeps.) 
847,DOCTOR: That's it. It's connected up. It should work.  
848,(She sets the timer on the microwave.) 
849,"DOCTOR: Moment of truth, then. Wish me luck. And goodbye. Oh, deep breath. Not you lot. Me. "
850,"(She inhales, holds it and activates the Sheffield Sonic. The microwave timer reaches zero, power surges through cables... and they all disappear. "
851,The Doctor opens her eyes to find she is floating in the vacuum of space - with her three new companions close by.)
