18,One 
19, [Refrigeration room] 
20, (Dry ice floods into the large open space. By
21,upper railings stand people in white uniforms with Prussian style hats
22,- the ones with a nasty spike sticking out of the top. Another waits
23,"downstairs. A woman, also in white, leads in six people. Everyone say"
24,Hi! to 
25,Patricia Quinn aka Magenta from the Rocky Horror Picture
26,Show.) 
27,BELAZS: Halt! 
28,"KRACAUER: Oh, you lucky, lucky people. You are the chosen ones, the"
29,"elite, specially selected to join our force of mercenaries and create"
30,fear and terror wherever you go. 
31,(Everyone say Hi! to  Tony
32,"Osoba, back again after eight years.) "
33,ZED: We were tricked. 
34,"KRACAUER: Kane has paid seventeen crowns for each of you, and he"
35,insists on value for money. 
36,ZED: Seventeen crowns? You couldn't even buy a dog for seventeen
37,crowns. 
38,KRACAUER: Precisely. I wouldn't have paid seventeen crowns for the lot
39,"of you, let alone each. "
40,"(Kracauer pushes him back and he falls, touching one of the boxes"
41,giving out the dry ice. It burns.) 
42,KRACAUER: Only frostburn. 
43,ZED: Frostburn? 
44,KRACAUER: Liquid nitrogen. Minus two hundred Celsius. Just be thankful
45,"your arm didn't go inside the vat, otherwise it would never have come"
46,"out again. Right, freeze them. "
47,ZED: Wait! You mean we're going to be frozen? 
48,"KRACAUER: Until Kane needs your services, yes. What's the matter,"
49,getting cold feet? 
50,"(Belazs moves the other men out. Zed hits the remaining guard, takes"
51,his weapon and tries to run for it. Kracauer starts shooting.) 
52,KRACAUER: Kill him! 
53,(Zed runs through a door.) 
54,KRACAUER: Leave him. He's in the restricted zone. He's a dead man. 
55, [Restricted zone] 
56, (Zed has gone into a room where an old man is
57,chiseling at a huge slab of ice. He trips and drops his newly acquired
58,weapon into a vat. A white clad arm with gold braid reaches in and
59,"takes it out, handing it back. Zed drops it on the floor, where it"
60,"shatters, then the pale faced man puts his hands on ??'s face, and he"
61,dies.) 
62,KANE: Pay no attention to the intruder. You may continue with your
63,work. 
64, [Tardis] 
65, (The scanner shows small planetoid sunlit at the
66,bottom and with a massive city on the opposite side.) 
67,MEL: Where is it? 
68,DOCTOR: Iceworld. A space trading colony on the dark side of the planet
69,Svartos. Space travellers stop there for supplies. I've been picking up
70,a faint tracking signal for some time. I think there's something
71,"interesting going on there, Mel. "
72, [Shopping mall] 
73, (A woman looks in a chest freezer then drags her
74,daughter away. The tannoy makes an announcement.) 
75,ANNOUNCER : Don't miss our special offer in the nurturing spares
76,department. Photon refrigeration units for only twenty four ninety
77,five. Thank you. 
78,(The Tardis materialises. Only the little girl looks up as Mel and the
79,Doctor come out.) 
80,MEL: A freezer centre? How boring. 
81,"DOCTOR: Oh, trust not appearances, Mel. You never know what might be"
82,lurking in the freezer chests. Think gothic. 
83,"(The little girl runs up to Mel wearing a mask, making her gasp then"
84,smile.) 
85,DOCTOR: This way. 
86, [Restaurant] 
87, (Amongst the people at the tables of this down
88,"market Cantina is Sabalom Glitz, who is complaining about something to"
89,a well built teenaged waitress. Everyone say Hi! to  Sophie Aldred.) 
90,"DOCTOR: Ah, two of your best strawberry milkshakes, if you please. "
91,"ANDERSON: Certainly, sir. "
92,GLITZ: There must be some mistake in the reckoning. 
93,"(The Doctor and Mel sit at the next table, and he takes out a book to"
94,"read. The Doctor's Dilemma, by Bernard Shaw.) "
95,"ACE: The mistake's in your wallet, not my arithmetic. "
96,GLITZ: Do you take Asteroid Express? 
97,DOCTOR: Glitz! 
98,MEL: Glitz! 
99,(Ace takes the credit card and goes to the bar as the Doctor and Mel
100,join Glitz at his table.) 
101,"GLITZ: What? No, never heard of him. "
102,"MEL: It's us, Mel and the Doctor. You haven't forgotten us, have you,"
103,Glitz? 
104,"GLITZ: Shush. Keep your voice down. No, of course I haven't forgotten"
105,"you. Mel, and the Doc. Here, you're not the Doctor. "
106,DOCTOR: I've regenerated. The difference is purely perceptual. 
107,"GLITZ: Here, you couldn't do us a favour, could you? You see, I'm in a"
108,spot of bother. 
109,(Ace brings the Doctor and Mel's drinks.) 
110,"DOCTOR: What's this, Glitz? Not another one of your dodgy deals"
111,backfired? 
112,"GLITZ: No, no, nothing like that, straight up. Fact is, I'm on a"
113,mission of highly philanthropic nature. 
114,MEL: What's that? 
115,GLITZ: It means it's beneficial to mankind. 
116,MEL: We know what philanthropic means. What's the mission? 
117,GLITZ: I have been entrusted to deliver certain secret documents which
118,nefarious unnamed parties would stop at nothing to grasp within their
119,own grubby digits. 
120,DOCTOR: You mean 
121,MEL: They'd kill you. 
122,(Three of Kane's white clad mercenaries. Belazs touches Glitz'
123,shoulder.) 
124,"BELAZS: Sabalom Glitz, we've been looking for you. "
125,"MEL: Leave him alone. If you kill him, you kill us too. "
126,"DOCTOR: Er, steady on there, Mel. "
127,BELAZS: What are you talking about? 
128,"MEL: Oh, he's told us everything, about how you tried to stop him"
129,delivering secret documents 
130,GLITZ: Shush. 
131,"BELAZS: Becoming quite a story-teller, aren't we, Glitz? I'm afraid you"
132,also seem to be a victim of Mister Glitz's cavalier attitude toward
133,facts. 
134,DOCTOR: Glitz. 
135,BELAZS: I'm not interested in any secret documents which Mister Glitz
136,may or may not possess. I am more concerned with the hundred crowns he
137,"took from my employer, Mister Kane, under false pretences. "
138,GLITZ: That was highest quality merchandise. 
139,BELAZS: A space freighter full of deep frozen fruit which turned out to
140,be rotten. 
141,"GLITZ: Oh, a bit on the ripe side, maybe. "
142,"BELAZS: They were putrefying, Glitz. "
143,"GLITZ: A little past their prime, perhaps. "
144,BELAZS: And Mister Kane does not run Iceworld to subsidise crooks like
145,"yourself. The hundred crowns, please. "
146,"DOCTOR: I think you'd better pay back the money, Glitz. "
147,GLITZ: I can't. 
148,DOCTOR: Why not? 
149,"GLITZ: Well, you see, there was this game of cards. I got well damaged."
150,
151,BELAZS: What about the hundred and two crowns you sold your crew for? 
152,(The Doctor returns to his book.) 
153,MEL: Sold your crew? 
154,"GLITZ: Well, the mutinous rabble, they tried to take command of my"
155,spacecraft. I relieved myself of them for seventeen crowns a piece.
156,"Rather more than they were worth, I think. "
157,BELAZS: The money. 
158,"GLITZ: Gone the way of all organic matter, I'm afraid. Down the tube. "
159,"BELAZS: In that case, we're confiscating your spacecraft. "
160,GLITZ: The Nosferatu? You can't do that. 
161,BELAZS: You have seventy two hours to find one hundred crowns or you
162,lose your spacecraft. 
163,GLITZ: But it's my livelihood. 
164,(Belazs and the two mercenaries leave.) 
165,"GLITZ: Doctor, you've got to help me. "
166,DOCTOR: You've only got yourself to blame. 
167, [Refrigeration room] 
168, (The remaining members of Glitz's crew go into
169,freezer alcoves.) 
170,KRACAUER: We're going to have trouble with this lot when you defrost
171,"them, Mister Kane. "
172,KANE: Trouble? 
173,KRACAUER: They didn't volunteer willingly. 
174,KANE: None of my mercenary force will be willing when I bring them out
175,of cryosleep. The process causes complete loss of memory. With no
176,"memories they can have no past, no future, no will of their own, no"
177,purpose except to obey me. Through them I shall be invincible. My power
178,shall be absolute. 
179, [Restaurant] 
180, ANDERSON: You will do as you're told. Less of your
181,lip or you're out on your ear. 
182,(Ace delivers a drink to a customer then goes to Mel and the Doctor.
183,Glitz is listening in from his table.) 
184,ACE: Hope the dragon gets you in the night. 
185,MEL: Dragon? What dragon? 
186,ACE: It's just a legend. There's supposed to be a terrifying dragon
187,living in the ice passages underneath Iceworld. 
188,MEL: I knew there must be a reason why you brought us here. You want to
189,"see the dragon, don't you. "
190,"DOCTOR: Oh really, Mel, it's fascinating. Travellers claim to have seen"
191,it throughout the centuries but there's never been any proof. 
192,MEL: Like the Lock Ness monster. 
193,DOCTOR: Loch. 
194,MEL: Och! 
195,ACE: You're going to go looking for the dragon? 
196,DOCTOR: Absolutely. 
197,"ACE: Oh, cool. Can I come too? "
198,DOCTOR: Won't you get into trouble with your boss? 
199,"ACE: Oh, I'm fed up with being a waitress. Oh, go on, Professor, let me"
200,come too. 
201,"DOCTOR: Well, I don't see why not. "
202,"ACE: Ace! And can we search for the treasure, too? "
203,DOCTOR: Treasure? 
204,ACE: Yeah. The dragon's supposed to be guarding a fabulous treasure. 
205,GLITZ: (laughs) Treasure? What treasure? You don't want to go believing
206,"in myths and legends, Doctor. "
207,MEL: Who asked you? We're not talking to you. 
208,"GLITZ: No, if you want my opinion, all this talk of treasure and"
209,"dragons, it's all a load of old spacedust. "
210,"ACE: Well, if you're so convinced it's all rubbish, why have you been"
211,burning holes in this treasure map for the last two days? 
212, [Control room] 
213, BELAZS: He says he lost the money in a game of
214,cards. 
215,KANE: I know he lost the money in a game of cards. The game was fixed.
216,What about the map? 
217,BELAZS: He's convinced it's genuine. 
218,KANE: Excellent. He'll soon realise if he wants to see his spacecraft
219,again he has no alternative but to go after the treasure. And when he
220,"does, I shall be with him every step of the way. "
221,BELAZS: There's just one thing. 
222,KANE: Yes? 
223,BELAZS: He appears to have two colleagues. 
224,KANE: Colleagues? I thought he sold his entire crew. 
225,"BELAZS: They're not from his crew, sir. Space travellers. A man and a"
226,girl. Do you want them eliminated? 
227,"KANE: Not for the moment, I think. There's no reason for them to"
228,suspect that the seal on the treasure map contains a tracking device. 
229, [Restaurant] 
230, (The Doctor is studying the map.) 
231,DOCTOR: Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating. 
232,MEL: Looks like something from a jumble sale to me. 
233,"GLITZ: Oi, there's nothing snide about this document. "
234,"ACE: You don't want to believe nothing you get from him, Professor. He"
235,probably bought two hundred of them in a job lot. 
236,"GLITZ: Do you mind? This is the real McCoy, this is. It comes from an"
237,unimpeachable source. 
238,"ACE: What's that, then? "
239,GLITZ: That means it is beyond reproach or question. 
240,"ACE: I know what unimpeachable means, bird bath, but what makes you so"
241,certain this map's pedigree is twenty four carat? 
242,GLITZ: Because I acquired it from a man of character and distinction. 
243,MEL: How? 
244,"GLITZ: I won it in er, a chess match. "
245,"MEL: You won it playing cards. Doctor, it's a waste of time. He won it"
246,in a card game. 
247,GLITZ: An honest transaction. The man was desperate not to lose this
248,"map, so I know it's something very, very tasty. "
249,DOCTOR: It shows the lower levels of Iceworld. 
250,ACE: No one goes down there any more. Too dangerous. 
251,"DOCTOR: The Ice Garden, the Singing Trees. "
252,"GLITZ: But like the girl says, Doctor, it's too dangerous. "
253,"DOCTOR: Where's your sense of adventure, Glitz? "
254,"GLITZ: What, do you want to go here, the Lake of Oblivion? "
255,DOCTOR: Where? 
256,"GLITZ: Depth of Eternal Darkness? Dragonfire? I should stop at home, if"
257,I were you. 
258,"ACE: Cor, this sounds brill. "
259,"DOCTOR: My sentiments precisely. What's your name, incidentally? "
260,ACE: Everyone calls me Ace. 
261,"DOCTOR: Oh, how do you do. I'm the Doctor and this is my friend Mel. "
262,ACE: And we're really going to go looking for dragons? 
263,GLITZ: Too risky if you ask me. 
264,"DOCTOR: Nonsense, Glitz. Time for a quick adventure then back for tea. "
265,ACE: Ace! 
266,"MEL: That's the spirit, Doctor. "
267,(The Doctor folds up the map.) 
268,"GLITZ: Hang about! You can't go without me, that's my map. And I don't"
269,"want these girls coming along, either. "
270,ACE: What? 
271,GLITZ: It's too dangerous. 
272,ACE: Professor! 
273,GLITZ: And since it's my map 
274,"ACE: Right, you male chauvinist bilge bag, just you wait. "
275,(Ace leaves.) 
276,"GLITZ: Oh, nice. "
277,DOCTOR: And I was so looking forward to meeting a dragon. 
278,"MEL: Oh, it's all right, Doctor, you go on ahead. I'll wait here. And"
279,"if Glitz burns his fingers in the dragon's fire, then it serves him"
280,right. 
281,"GLITZ: It's just you and me, then, Doctor. "
282,(The Doctor stops to tickle a hairy child under the chin. It barks and
283,snarls at him.) 
284, [Control room] 
285, BELAZS: They have left the upper levels now. 
286,"KANE: Only two of them, you say? "
287,BELAZS: Glitz and the traveller called the Doctor. They're just setting
288,off for the lower levels. 
289,KANE: Excellent. Continue to monitor the tracking device. Well? 
290,BELAZS: It's Glitz's spacecraft. 
291,KANE: What of it? 
292,BELAZS: It's just that 
293,KANE: Yes? 
294,"BELAZS: Well, if Glitz and the Doctor are as good as dead, I'd like the"
295,spacecraft. 
296,"KANE: Oh, you'd like the spacecraft, would you? When you first came"
297,here you had nothing. You were willing enough to take my payment then.
298,But now you want to leave. Perhaps you have memories of a home you can
299,return to? Perhaps I should have put you into cryosleep along with all
300,the others and erased your memories. 
301,(Kane takes Belazs' face with one hand and holds up his ungloved hand
302,to it. She flinches and he takes her left hand instead.) 
303,"KANE: Perhaps you need reminding. As long as you bear my mark, I own"
304,you. 
305,(Her palm has the imprint of a coin burnt into it. Kane activates the
306,communicator.) 
307,"MAN : Yes, sir? "
308,KANE: Glitz's spacecraft. Have it destroyed. 
309,"MAN : Yes, sir. "
310, [Restaurant] 
311," (Ace takes drinks to the woman and her daughter,"
312,then unpins her bun to release a pony tail.) 
313,ANNOUNCER : Would the emergency services please report to the
314,docking bay to deal with an ice jam. Thank you. 
315,MEL: It's all your fault. 
316,ACE: How'd you work that out? 
317,"MEL: You were encouraging them both. Oh ace, oh brill. "
318,"WOMAN: You girl. Yes, you, girl. Come here. "
319,ACE: What do you want? 
320,WOMAN: This milkshake isn't adequately shaken. 
321,"ACE: That's how they come, missus. "
322,WOMAN: It's got lumps in it. 
323,MEL: It's supposed to have lumps in it. That's the ice cream. 
324,WOMAN: But we don't want lumps in it. Shake it some more. 
325,ACE: Shake it yourself. 
326,WOMAN: I beg your pardon? 
327,ACE: You heard. 
328,WOMAN: I've never been so insulted 
329,"ACE: Bet you've never had a milk shake tipped over your head, neither. "
330,(Ace is as good as her word. The woman squeals and the barman cum
331,manager rushes to her.) 
332,"ANDERSON: I'm awfully sorry, madam. That does it, you're fired. "
333,ACE: I'm sorry. It won't happen again. 
334,ANDERSON: Get out. I've had enough of you. 
335,ACE: I promise it'll never happen again. 
336,"ANDERSON: Get out! You too, out. "
337,MEL: Me? 
338,ANDERSON: Both of you. Out! 
339,"MEL: All right, I'm going. "
340,"ANDERSON: You're troublemakers, hooligans. I do apologise for my staff."
341,"I do assure you, those milk shakes don't stain. "
342,"(Ace's last act is to tip one over his head, too.) "
343, [Restricted zone] 
344, (The image of a woman is being cut from the ice
345,block. Kane admires it then goes to lie on a table.) 
346,COMPUTER: Current ambient temperature minus ten Celsius. Target
347,temperature minus a hundred and ninety three Celsius. 
348,(A clear lid closes over Kane.) 
349,COMPUTER: Cabinet temperature dropping. 
350, [Ace's room] 
351, (A typical teenage mess.) 
352,"ANNOUNCER : If there's anyone in the emergency control room, would"
353,you please answer the phone. Thank you. 
354,(Ace and Mel enter. Ace throws herself on the bed.) 
355,"ACE: Well, come on in, if you're going to. He really gets up my"
356,"nostrils, that Glitz. "
357,"MEL: Oh, he's all right underneath. "
358,"ACE: No. He's a grade A hundred percent div, that's what he is."
359,Underneath. 
360,(Mel starts picking up clothes in the hunt for a chair to sit on.) 
361,"ACE: Look, leave those alone, will you? "
362,MEL: I was only trying to make room to sit. 
363,"ACE: Well, just sit on top of them like everyone else does, can't you? "
364,"MEL: All right, all right. "
365,ACE: I've been meaning to do the washing for a couple of weeks. 
366,MEL: Looks more like a couple of months to me. 
367,ACE: You're just like the teachers used to be at school. How do you
368,expect to pass your chemistry A level if you can't even store the
369,equipment properly? 
370,MEL: A level? You're from Earth? 
371,ACE: Used to be. 
372,MEL: Whereabouts on Earth? 
373,ACE: Perivale. 
374,MEL: Sounds nice. 
375,ACE: You ever been there? 
376,MEL: No. 
377,ACE: I was doing this brill experiment to extract nitroglycerine from
378,"gelignite, but I think something must have gone wrong. This time storm"
379,blows up from nowhere and whisks me up here. 
380,MEL: When was this? 
381,ACE: Does it matter? 
382,"MEL: Well, don't you ever want to go back? "
383,ACE: Not particularly. 
384,(Ace changes out of her waitress apron and puts on a padded jacket
385,"decorated with NASA space mission badges. And a Fanderson one, and Ace"
386,Roofing Co.) 
387,MEL: What about your mum and dad? 
388,ACE: I haven't got no mum and dad. I've never had no mum and dad and I
389,"don't want no mum and dad. It's just me, all right? "
390,"MEL: Sorry. What about your chemistry A level, then? "
391,ACE: That's no good. I got suspended after I blew up the art room. 
392,MEL: You blew up the art room? 
393,ACE: It was only a small explosion. They couldn't understand how
394,blowing up the art room was a creative act. 
395,"ANNOUNCER : If anyone sees any member of the emergency services,"
396,will you please ask them to pop along to the upper docking bay when
397,they've a moment to spare. Thank you. 
398,(Ace takes some pressurised cans from a rucksack.) 
399,ACE: Isn't anyone going to do anything about that ice jam blocking the
400,"docking bay? Here, take these. "
401,MEL: Deodorant? 
402,ACE: They're just old cans. They've got home made Nitro Nine in them
403,now. 
404,MEL: Nitro Nine? 
405,"ACE: It's just like ordinary nitroglycerine, except it's got a bit more"
406,wallop. Careful you don't drop them. Come on. 
407,(Ace puts the rucksack over her shoulder and leaves.) 
408, [Control room] 
409, (Belazs watches Kane in the restricted zone
410,through a glass door.) 
411,COMPUTER: Cabinet at minus a hundred and ninety three Celsius. 
412,(She goes to the central console and activates the communicator.) 
413,"MAN : Yes, sir. "
414,"BELAZS: It's me, Belazs. (pronounced Belaj) Mister Kane has changed his"
415,"mind about Glitz's spacecraft. It's not to be destroyed, do you"
416,understand? 
417,MAN : Spacecraft is not to be destroyed. 
418,BELAZS: That is correct. 
419, [Lower levels] 
420, (The Doctor and Glitz are following the map along
421,catwalks between walls of ice. They stop at an intersection.) 
422,"DOCTOR: Have you seen any Singing Trees or Ice Gardens, Glitz? "
423,"GLITZ: We're still too close to the upper levels, Doctor. Let's cast me"
424,eyes over the map. 
425,"DOCTOR: Well, since we've come from that direction, I think we should"
426,go in that direction. Then again 
427,(Glitz drops the map and bends to retrieve it as the Doctor's umbrella
428,swings above his head.) 
429,DOCTOR: Perhaps that direction. Yes. And keep your eyes peeled for any
430,"Singing Trees or Ice Gardens, Glitz. "
431, [Docking bay] 
432," KRACAUER: Come on, both sides, push! Harder! Push."
433,
434,(Mel and Ace enter.) 
435,"ACE: Gordon Bennett, what a bunch of Spocks. They'll never get it open"
436,"at that rate. Here, let's have a couple of those. "
437,"MEL: You're not going to use those, are you? "
438,(Ace pulls the tops of the cans and walks up to the frozen hatchway.) 
439,"ACE: If I were you lot, I'd go for your tea break now. "
440,(She sticks the cans on the ice.) 
441,KRACAUER: Why? What's in those cans? 
442,ACE: Nitro Nine. We've got eight seconds. Last one back's a gooey mess.

451,"monitor, then back to the sculpture.) "
452,COMPUTER: Target blood temperature of minus one hundred and ninety
453,three Celsius achieved. 
454,(Kane gets out of his cabinet.) 
455,KANE: What are you doing in the restricted zone? 
456,BELAZS: I was looking for you. There's been an ice jam in the upper
457,docking bay and the emergency services haven't responded. 
458,KANE: Must I do everything myself? Go there immediately and take charge
459,of the situation. 
460,BELAZS: Of course. 
461, [Singing Trees] 
462," (An area of stalactites, crystalline stalagmites"
463,and a tinkling sound.) 
464,DOCTOR: Singing Trees. 
465,GLITZ: But these aren't trees. 
466,"DOCTOR: Use your imagination, Glitz. Willow trees, something like that."
467,
468,"GLITZ: Well, where's the singing coming from? "
469,DOCTOR: Air current causes the crystal membranes to vibrate. 
470,(Glitz picks up an icicle.) 
471,GLITZ: I bet this is worth a few grotzits. 
472,"DOCTOR: Yes, what's it do? "
473,GLITZ: Do? 
474,"DOCTOR: Yes. Some sort of opto-electronic circuit. But why? I mean,"
475,what's it doing here? 
476,GLITZ: You mean someone made all this? Dragons? 
477,"DOCTOR: Possibly. Come on, Glitz. Tempus fugit. I want to be back in"
478,time for tea. 
479, [Docking bay] 
480, (Belazs enters with an escort.) 
481,BELAZS: What is going on? You two are under arrest. Take them away. 
482,MEL: What? 
483,ACE: Hang about! Put me down. 
484,(Mel and Ace are hustled away.) 
485,ACE: Leave me alone! Get off! Stop it! Not fair! 
486, [Ice junction] 
487, (Glitz takes a right turn by a formation that
488,"looks like flowers, leaving the Doctor alone on the slippery"
489,passageway.) 
490,DOCTOR: Glitz? Glitz? Glitz? 
491, [Refrigeration room] 
492," KANE: Quite a little expert with explosives, I"
493,hear. 
494,ACE: Yeah? So what if I am. 
495,"KANE: Excellent. I like women with fire in their bellies, don't I,"
496,Belazs? I might yet have a use for you. 
497,ACE: Oh yeah? What makes you think I'd be interested? 
498,"KANE: Oh, I can be very persuasive. "
499,ACE: I'm not frightened of you. 
500,KANE: Good. Because I shall need people like you in my army of
501,mercenaries. 
502,ACE: You what? 
503,"KANE: Think about it. Travelling through the twelve galaxies, the"
504,"diamond sparkle of meteorite showers, the rainbow flashes of an ion"
505,storm. Think about it. 
506,"MEL: Don't listen to him, Ace! "
507,(Ace snaps out of her trance.) 
508,KANE: How old are you? 
509,ACE: Six... eighteen. 
510,"KANE: Eighteen, eh? No home to call your own. The twelve galaxies are"
511,your home. Come with me. I understand you. 
512,"MEL: It won't be like that, Ace! Don't believe him. "
513,KANE: Join me. Take my golden sovereign. 
514,(He puts it on the console for her. Its intense cold steams against
515,the metal.) 
516,KANE: Take the sovereign. 
517,"MEL: Don't do it, Ace! Please, don't do it! "
518,KANE: You've heard altogether too much. Freeze her! 
519,"MEL: No, Ace! "
520,KANE: Take my coin. Take the coin. 
521,(Ace knocks the coin to the floor and brandishes a can of Nitro Nine.) 
522,"ACE: Right, freeze! I mean, don't freeze. Stand still and let Mel go. "
523,(Kane nods.) 
524,KANE: You stupid girl. Think it's that easy to walk away from me? 
525,ACE: Do you feel like arguing with a can of deodorant that registers
526,nine on the Richter scale? Run! 
527, [Lower level] 
528, (Mel and Ace run out and meet up on the ice
529,"catwalk. They keep running. Meanwhile, the Doctor finds himself at the"
530,"top of an ice cliff. For some bizarre reason, he climbs over the"
531,railing. Ace and Mel stop running in a dark area.) 
532,"MEL: Hang on, are you sure this is the right way? "
533,ACE: Course I'm sure. Don't you trust me? 
534,MEL: I don't know. What with the dragon and all that. 
535,ACE: The dragon. It's just something to frighten little children with.
536,It's like witches and goblins. There ain't no such thing. 
537,(Then something black and rather dragonesque approaches them. Mel
538,screams. Meanwhile the Doctor is hanging off a railing running along
539,the edge of the ice cliff. He reaches for his umbrella which is also
540,"hooked onto the railing, but his hands slide down the fabric, leaving"
541,him dangling above an abyss.) 
542, Part Two
543,
544, [Lower level] 
545, ACE: Wicked! 
546,MEL: Get down! 
547,(Mel pulls Ace back before it fires something that sparks when it hits
548,the icewall.) 
549,ACE: That's not a real dragon. That was a laser beam. 
550,MEL: Look out! 
551, [Ice cliff] 
552, (Glitz is looking over the railing at the Doctor
553,dangling from his umbrella.) 
554,"GLITZ: It's no use, Doctor. I've located the Ice Garden but there's a"
555,distinct absence of dragon or treasure. 
556,"DOCTOR: Glitz, I sympathise with your disappointment, but I'm about to"
557,plummet to my death. 
558,"GLITZ: Oh, I suppose you want me to risk my neck and come and help you."
559,
560,DOCTOR: Glitz! 
561,"GLITZ: All right, all right. Don't get your delicates in a twist. "
562,DOCTOR: Glitz! 
563, [Refrigeration room] 
564," KANE: Belazs, you astound me. Those two girls"
565,should have been searched when they were arrested. You seem to be
566,"taking advantage of my former feelings for you. Be warned, the past is"
567,"an empty slate. I demand absolute loyalty now and forever, and I don't"
568,forgive those who betray me. The girls must be stopped before they
569,reach Glitz and the Doctor. They must be eradicated. 
570,(Kane activates the control to open up some freezer units.) 
571,KANE: What could be more appropriate than to despatch some of Glitz's
572,"former crew after the girls. He betrayed his crew, now they can have"
573,their revenge. Everyone should be allowed his moment of revenge. 
574, [Base of the Ice cliff] 
575, (The Doctor climbs down off Glitz's shoulders in
576,"the most convoluted fashion, ending upside down between his legs.) "
577,"DOCTOR: I say, thank you. "
578,"GLITZ: It's no use, Doctor. Even if we did find the treasure, it'd take"
579,"us longer than seventy two hours, and Belazs said if I didn't return"
580,Kane's money within seventy two hours they'd confiscate my spacecraft. 
581,DOCTOR: Why don't you explain the problem to him? 
582,"GLITZ: Oh, he'd slice his own mother up to make a point. If he was a"
583,"mortician, the corpses would keep their eyes open. "
584,DOCTOR: Ah. 
585,"GLITZ: In fact, if Kane knew we were after the "
586, [Refrigeration room] 
587, (Belazs is listening in via the tracker in the map
588,seal.) 
589,"GLITZ : Dragon's treasure, your life expectancy wouldn't be looking"
590,"too clever at the moment. He's a cold man, Doctor. Cut him open and you"
591,"won't find a heart, just a lump of ice. "
592, [Base of the Ice cliff] 
593, DOCTOR: These types never have any sense of fair
594,play. 
595,GLITZ: Exactly. Which is why I've come to the conclusion that play it
596,by the rules is a mug's game. I have decided to hijack the Nosferatu.
597,"Which is where you come in, Doctor. "
598,"DOCTOR: Ah, hang on there a minute, Glitz. I'm engaged in a project of"
599,"scientific curiosity. I mean, that dragon, or whatever it may turn out"
600,"to be, could be an undiscovered species. "
601,"GLITZ: Look, I'll do you a good deal. You help me get the Nosferatu"
602,"back, and I'll give you the treasure map so's you and Mel can go"
603,"looking for this dragon. I can't say fairer than that, can I? "
604,"DOCTOR: You have me there, Glitz. Without the map, I'll never find the"
605,creature. 
606,"GLITZ: You're a man of insight and logic, Doctor. "
607,(Glitz gives the Doctor the map.) 
608,"DOCTOR: All right, then. Where's the Nosferatu berthed? "
609, [Refrigeration room] 
610, GLITZ : In the lower docking bay. 
611,(The zombie crew march along the ice cat walks.) 
612, [Restricted zone] 
613, (The sculptor is at work.) 
614,"KANE: A work of artistry, my friend. Incandescent artistry. I could"
615,"almost believe Xana lives again. A unique beauty, yes, but more than"
616,"that, a criminal genius also. Oh, what a waste. It should have been I"
617,"who was killed escaping arrest, not you. "
618, [Top of the Ice cliff] 
619, ACE: You're joking. I'm not going down there. 
620,"MEL: Look, there's the Doctor's brolly. We must be on the right track. "
621,ACE: What did he have to come this way for? I could break my neck. 
622,MEL: How are we going to get down there? 
623,ACE: Hang on. 
624,(Ace rummages in her rucksack and produces a roll of slim metal
625,ladder.) 
626, [Lower docking bay] 
627, GLITZ: There's only one guard. Do you think you
628,can occupy him while I slip on board? 
629,DOCTOR: I'll do my best. 
630,"GLITZ: Go on, then. Away you go. "
631,(The Doctor walks up to the guard.) 
632,DOCTOR: Excuse me. What's your attitude towards the nature of
633,"existence? For example, do you hold any strong theological opinions? "
634,GUARD: I think you'll find most educated people regard mythical
635,convictions as fundamentally animistic. 
636,DOCTOR: I see. That's a very interesting concept. 
637,"GUARD: Personally, I find most experiences border on the existential. "
638,"DOCTOR: Well, how do you reconcile that with the empirical critical"
639,belief that experience is at the root of all phenomena? 
640,GUARD: I think you'll find that a concept can be philosophically valid
641,even if theologically meaningless. 
642,"DOCTOR: So, what you're saying is that before Plato existed, someone"
643,had to have the idea of Plato. 
644,(Glitz slips into the docking bay.) 
645,"GUARD: Oh, you've no idea what a relief it is for me to have such a"
646,stimulating philosophical discussion. There are so few intellectuals
647,"about these days. Tell me, what do you think of the assertion that the"
648,semiotic thickness of a performed text varies according to the
649,redundancy of auxiliary performance codes? 
650,DOCTOR: Yes. 
651,"(Mel starts down the ladder, collecting the Doctor's umbrella on the"
652,way. Ace follows.) 
653, [Nosferatu] 
654," (Small, messy with a pair of giant fluffy dice"
655,dangling from a chain.) 
656,"GLITZ: Ah, my ship. Soon be light years away from this place. "
657,(Glitz straps himself into the pilots seat then gets a gun placed to
658,his head.) 
659,BELAZS: I wouldn't touch those controls if I were you. 
660, [Base of the Ice cliff] 
661, ACE: Wicked. And the bilge bag said this was too
662,dangerous for girls. 
663, [Nosferatu] 
664, BELAZS: This spacecraft is mine. 
665,"GLITZ: Hang on, the seventy two hours aren't up yet. You said if I"
666,could get hold of the grotzits I could have the Nosferatu back. 
667,BELAZS: Then I shall just have to make sure you don't manage to find
668,the money in time. I shall have to make very sure. 
669,(The Doctor runs in.) 
670,"DOCTOR: Hello. Not interrupting anything, am I? "
671,BELAZS: What are you doing here? 
672,DOCTOR: That's a very difficult question. Why is everyone round here so
673,preoccupied with metaphysics? 
674,"GLITZ: I think she's going to kill us, Doctor. "
675,DOCTOR: Ah. An existentialist. 
676,"BELAZS: Quiet! Only one of us can leave Iceworld aboard the Nosferatu,"
677,and one way or the other it's going to be me. 
678,"GLITZ: What about the boss, Mister Kane? Does he know of your little"
679,enterprise? 
680,BELAZS: Kane doesn't own me. 
681,"DOCTOR: Oh, I think he does. I think he bought you like he buys"
682,everything in Iceworld. 
683,BELAZS: What would you know about it? 
684,DOCTOR: I think he bought you a long time ago. He paid seventeen crowns
685,for each of Glitz's crew. How much did he pay for you? Was it worth it?
686,Were you worth it? 
687,(Belazs holds up her burnt palm.) 
688,"BELAZS: That's what I sold myself for, Kane's mark. I ought to cut my"
689,hand off for doing it. 
690,"(While Belazs is distracted by the Doctor, Glitz unbuckles himself and"
691,takes her gun.) 
692,"BELAZS: Go on, then. Kill me! "
693,"GLITZ: Well, come on, Doctor. We've got the Nosferatu back. Let's get"
694,out of here. 
695,"DOCTOR: No, Glitz. You can't go on stealing everything you want, like"
696,"this Stradivarius and that Dutch master. Pay Kane back his debt, even"
697,"if it costs a thousand crowns, ten thousand crowns. Pay back the debt."
698,"And as for you, your debt to Kane, I don't think you'll be able to pay"
699,it off. Ever. 
700, [Restricted zone] 
701, (The statue is completed.) 
702,KANE: The whole of eternity has held its breath for this moment. But no
703,"one must ever see your work. It exists, that is enough. No one can ever"
704,look upon your work and live. Gaze on it and die fulfilled. 
705,(Kane places his bare hands on the sculptor's face and freezes him to
706,death.)

709,ACE: Shush. Did you hear that? 
710,MEL: Hear what? 
711,ACE: I thought I heard something. 
712,"MEL: Well, what kind of something? "
713,(The zombie crew are coming up behind them.) 
714,ACE: I don't know. Can you see anything? 
715,(More crew come round the corner.) 
716,MEL: Look out! 
717,ACE: Run! 
718,"(Elsewhere, a bulkhead door creaks open. It is the Doctor and Glitz.) "
719,"DOCTOR: I think we go straight on. (distant roar) Either that, or we"
720,don't. 
721,"(They start to creep along a catwalk, then the dragon fires its lasers"
722,at them. They retreat behind the bulkhead door again.) 
723,"GLITZ: Well, now that we've found the Dragonfire, what's next on your"
724,"list of tourist attractions, Doctor? "
725,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm not absolutely certain this one's over yet. "
726,(The bulkhead is getting hot from the dragon trying to cut through it.)
727,
728,DOCTOR: It must be generating a spot temperature in excess of fifteen
729,hundred Celsius. 
730,"(Back with the girls, Mel pulls the top off a can.) "
731,"MEL: Right, cover your ears. "
732,(Boom! The zombies don't like it.) 
733,"ACE: Ace! Yeah, good job. Throw the other one. "
734,(Boom!) 
735,"ACE: Yeah, go for it, tiger. That was well brill. "
736,MEL: We're not in the clear yet. 
737,(A zombie gets up.) 
738,ACE: I don't believe it. Not after two cans of Nitro. Nothing can
739,"survive that. Come on, Mel, shift! "
740,MEL: Okay! 
741,(Around the corner Mel slips and hits her head on some metal stairs.) 
742,"ACE: Come on! Come on, wake up. "
743,(Ace drags Mel under the stairs. The zombie clomps round the corner and
744,"goes up the stairs, standing directly above them. Then he goes back"
745,down and continues along the catwalk.) 
746,"MEL: Oh, what happened? "
747,"ACE: It's all right, doughnut. He's gone. "
748,(The dragon cuts through the bulkhead door.) 
749,"GLITZ: Get back, Doctor. "
750,(Glitz aims Belazs's gun at the dragon.) 
751,"DOCTOR: No, Glitz, don't. "
752,GLITZ: Why? 
753,DOCTOR: We've got no right to kill. 
754,(The Doctor throws the gun away and the dragon leaves.) 
755,GLITZ: Why didn't it kill us? 
756,DOCTOR: Perhaps we'd better ask it.

758," KRACAUER: Can't sleep, Belazs? "
759,"BELAZS: How old do you think I am, Kracauer? "
760,"KRACAUER: Thirty three, thirty four? "
761,BELAZS: And how old do you think I was when I first agreed to join
762,Kane? Sixteen. That was a long time ago. Do you see this? 
763,"KRACAUER: Yes, the mark of the sovereign. "
764,BELAZS: You'd have thought it would begin to disappear after twenty
765,years. 
766,KRACAUER: We sold ourselves. We knew what we were doing. We had a
767,choice. 
768,BELAZS: I was sixteen. 
769,KRACAUER: Even at sixteen we had a choice. 
770,BELAZS: He'll kill us. He'll find someone younger and he'll kill us
771,unless we kill him first. 
772,KRACAUER: How do you propose to do that? 
773,BELAZS: With heat. Even here in Iceworld it's too warm for him. I've
774,seen inside the restricted zone. That's where he keeps his
775,refrigeration unit. He has to return there whenever his body
776,temperature rises too high.

782,
783,MEL: No. 
784,"ACE: I worked as a waitress in a fast food cafe. Day in, day out, same"
785,boring routine. Some boring life. It was all wrong. It didn't feel like
786,me that was doing it at all. I felt like I'd fallen from another planet
787,"and landed in this strange girl's body, but it wasn't me at all. I was"
788,meant to be somewhere else. Each night I'd walk home and I'd look up at
789,"the stars through the gaps in the clouds, and I tried to imagine where"
790,I really came from. I dreamed that one day everything would come right.
791,"I'd be carried off back home, back to my real mum and dad. Then it"
792,actually happened and I ended up here. Ended up working as a waitress
793,"again, only this time I couldn't dream about going nowhere else. There"
794,wasn't nowhere else to go.

806,ACE: It's my name. It's not really Ace. My real name's Dorothy. That's

824,on a serious scientific undertaking. 
825,MEL: Do you mean the dragon? 
826,"DOCTOR: Well, it's not so much a dragon as more of a semi-organic"
827,vertebrate with a highly developed cerebral cortex. 
828,ACE: And it's got laser beams in its eyes. It tried to kill us. 
829,MEL: Yes. 
830,"DOCTOR: Really? Well, I wonder what you did to annoy it? "

839,GLITZ: Hang about. I'd recognise that mutinous expression anywhere. 
840,"ACE: Friend of yours, is he? "
841,"GLITZ: Pudovkin, old son, you've no idea how pleased I am to see you"
842,again. 
843,"DOCTOR: It's no good, Glitz. Ace says he's been cryogenically frozen. "
844,GLITZ: What about the time we captured that space freighter loaded up
845,"with all that natural fruit alcohol. We got well dehydrated that night,"
846,didn't we? 
847,DOCTOR: It's no use. Deep cryogenics freezes the neural pathways. 
848,"GLITZ: Oh, come on, old son. A joke's a joke. It's me, Sabalom Glitz. "
849,DOCTOR: It's completely impossible for him to recall any events prior
850,to cryogenesis. 
851,PUDOVKIN: I remember.

853,PUDOVKIN: I remember how you always had the best of our pickings. 
854,GLITZ: I don't recall. 
855,PUDOVKIN: I remember. I remember how you sold our entire crew to Kane

877,(Then Kane sees the statue.) 
878,"KANE: No, not my statue. No! Who has desecrated the monument? Who? "
879,(Kane takes Kracauer's face in his bare hands and kills him.) 
880,KANE: Belazs.

887,"ACE: Here, I can hear singing. Where's it coming from, Professor? "
888,DOCTOR: I think he wants us to watch. 
889,"ACE: What's he doing, Professor. "
890,(The dragon fires short burst of laser energy at a crystal.) 
891,"DOCTOR: Ah, so that's what this is all about, a polydimensional"
892,scanning imager. And our friend the creature's using itself as the energy
893,source.

898,mentality have been the leaders of the notorious Kane-Xana gang. Until
899,"its demise, this gang carried out systematic violence and extortion"
900,"unequalled in its brutality. In view of the sheer evil of his crimes,"
901,Kane is to be exiled from the planet Proamon and never allowed to
902,"return home. He will be banished to the barren planet of Svartos, which"
903,has a permanently frozen dark side on which he can survive.

905," (Kane enters, hands behind his back.) "
906,"KANE: Ah, my dear Belazs. You know, I've been thinking. I've been"
907,thinking of your request to leave. You've been with me a long time now.
908,"I've grown very fond of you, but I've been thinking it over carefully"
909,and I've decided. You may leave me. 
910,BELAZS: Leave? 
911,KANE: Whenever you wish. Go in fortune and happiness. 
912,(Kane grabs her face in his hands.)

914,years. How can you stand in my way now I am so close? 
915, [Singing Trees]

919,(The hologram fades away.) 
920,DOCTOR: Fascinating. 
921,"MEL: Well, that explains about Kane, but where does the creature come"
922,from? 
923,GLITZ: And what about the fabulous treasure? Is this it? 
924,"DOCTOR: Oh, no, no. We might be deep beneath Iceworld, but Kane could"
925,"find his way here easily enough. No, the treasure's got to be somewhere"
926,"else, somewhere beyond Kane's reach. What does he fear most? "
927,ACE: Heat. It'll kill him. 
928,DOCTOR: Precisely. And what better way of protecting the real treasure
929,than to leave a fire-breathing dragon to guard it? What better
930,protection than if the dragon is the treasure. 
931,"MEL: The creature, the treasure? "
932,"DOCTOR: Am I right? Are you the one that everyone's looking for,"
933,treasure? 
934,"(The top of the dragon's head opens, and crystal rises up, sparking"
935,electricity.) 
936,GLITZ: It must be worth a fortune. 
937,"DOCTOR: No, look past the gold and the gemstone, Glitz. Look at the"
938,fire inside. A source of intense optical energy.

964,"MEL: Well, the hologram said that Proamon was Kane's home planet. "
965,"DOCTOR: Yes, but where have I heard of it before? I mean, where was it?"
966,Was it in the past or is it in the future? 
967,"GLITZ: Is any of this important, Doctor? "

973,"GLITZ: No need to perambulate back to Iceworld, Doctor. These passages"
974,"have their own star charts. The Ice Garden. I found it, remember? "
975,"DOCTOR: A primitive star chart. Missing constellations, orbital"

977,ACE: Ice garden? 
978,"DOCTOR: Er, you stay here. I shan't be long. "

980,back. 
981,ACE: Bilge bag.

1274,implanting the power source inside the creature. They shall learn of
1275,their folly.

1307,DOCTOR: But where will you find another home planet? 
1308,"KANE: You're talking in riddles, Doctor. Proamon is my home planet. "
1309,DOCTOR: Was your home planet. Take a look at your navigational
1310,equipment. It's fully operative now. 
1311,KANE: There must be something wrong. 
1312,"DOCTOR: Sadly not. Your planet, your people, your entire race were"
1313,destroyed one thousand years after you were exiled. 
1314,"KANE: No. No, it's not possible. "
1315,"DOCTOR: Look at the sun of Proamon. When you left, it was a cold red"
1316,giant surrounded by freezing planets. 
1317,KANE: There's nothing there but a neutron star. 
1318,"DOCTOR: Your sun turned supernova two thousand years ago, and all its"
1319,"planets were engulfed in the explosion. Your people were annihilated,"
1320,"your planet obliterated. You're too late, Kane, for your revenge. You"
1321,have no home. Time has flowed by. 
1322,KANE: No. No! It shall not be! 
1323,(Kane opens a shutter to the outside.) 
1324,"COMPUTER: Danger, unfiltered sunlight. "
1325,GLITZ: What's he doing? It's scorching. 
1326,"(Kane walks up to the porthole and promptly melts, screaming.) "
1327, [Iceworld] 
1328," GLITZ : Good afternoon, shoppers. This is the"
1329,"new management speaking, Captain Glitz. It's time for a few changes. "
1330, [Tardis] 
1331," MEL: Well, I suppose it's time. "
1332,"DOCTOR: Time? Funny old business, time. It delights in frustrating your"
1333,plans. All Kane's bitterness and hatred thwarted by a quirk of time. 
1334,"MEL: No, I meant I suppose it's time I should be going. "
1335,DOCTOR: Oh. 
1336,MEL: Time that I left. 
1337,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, you could be right. Time for you to go. "
1338,(The Doctor becomes very interested in the console.) 
1339,"MEL: Before I go, I "
1340,"DOCTOR: Funny old business, time. "
1341,MEL: Doctor. 
1342,"DOCTOR: Well, if you must go. "
1343,MEL: Before I go I'd like to say 
1344,"DOCTOR: There's no point, Mel. No point hanging around wasting time. "
1345,"MEL: No, I'm not going until I've said my piece. I just want to say"
1346,that 
1347,"DOCTOR: There's no time, Mel. "
1348,"MEL: Oh, all right, you win. "
1349,DOCTOR: I do. I usually do. 
1350,MEL: I'm going now. 
1351,"DOCTOR: That's right, yes, you're going. Been gone for ages. Already"
1352,"gone, still here, just arrived, haven't even met you yet. It all"
1353,"depends on who you are and how you look at it. Strange business, time. "
1354,"MEL: Goodbye, Doctor. "
1355,"DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Mel. Think about me when you're living your life one"
1356,"day after another, all in a neat pattern. Think about the homeless"
1357,"traveller and his old police box, with his days like crazy paving. "
1358,MEL: Who said anything about home? I've got much more crazy things to
1359,do yet. 
1360,(They hug. Glitz enters with Ace.) 
1361,"GLITZ: Well, we've officially renamed my new spacecraft the Nosferatu"
1362,"Two, just cracked a bottle of ye old carbonated fruit alcohol over the"
1363,"bows and next stop sunny Perivale, eh, sprog? "
1364,ACE: Suppose so. 
1365,MEL: Have you got room for another one? 
1366,GLITZ: Are you Perivale bound as well? 
1367,"MEL: Well, I was thinking of going a bit further. "
1368,GLITZ: How much further? 
1369,MEL: How much further are you going? 
1370,GLITZ: Hang on half a millisecond. 
1371,"DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, Mel can keep you out of trouble, Glitz. "
1372,MEL: And that means no more dodgy deals. 
1373,"GLITZ: Thanks a billion, Doctor. "
1374,DOCTOR: Glitz. 
1375,MEL: Ace doesn't have anywhere to go. 
1376,"DOCTOR: Nonsense. An idyllic place, Perivale. It's got lush green"
1377,"fields and a village blacksmith, and "
1378,"MEL: Doctor, she comes from the twentieth century. "
1379,DOCTOR: Oh. 
1380,"GLITZ: Come on, Mel. Extract your digit. "
1381,MEL: I'll send you a postcard. 
1382,DOCTOR: But I don't have an address. 
1383,"MEL: Oh, I'll put it in a bottle and throw it into space. It'll reach"
1384,"you, in time. "
1385,(Glitz and Mel leave.) 
1386,"DOCTOR: Ace, where do you think you're going? "
1387,ACE: Perivale. 
1388,"DOCTOR: Ah yes, but by which route? The direct route with Glitz, or the"
1389,scenic route? Well? Do you fancy a quick trip round the twelve galaxies
1390,and then back to Perivale in time for tea? 
1391,ACE: Ace! 
1392,"DOCTOR: But there are three rules. One, I'm in charge. "
1393,"ACE: Whatever you say, Professor. "
1394,"DOCTOR: Two, I'm not the Professor, I'm the Doctor. "
1395,ACE: Whatever you want. 
1396,"DOCTOR: And the third. Well, I'll think up the third by the time we get"
1397,back to Perivale. 
1398, [Shopping mall] 
1399, (Little Stellar reaches for the Tardis door
1400,handle.) 
1401,WOMAN: There you are. I've been looking all over for you. Now come on.
