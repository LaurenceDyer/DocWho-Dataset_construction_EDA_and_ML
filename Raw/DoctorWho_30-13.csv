20,
21,(The Doctor has golden energy streaming from his
22,"hands and head, and he, Jack and Rose believe he is regenerating. With"
23,"an effort, the Doctor turns and points both hands towards his spare"
24,hand in the jar by the time console. It absorbs it and he is released.)
25,
26,DOCTOR: Now then. Where were we? 
27,"(Donna, Jack and Rose are stunned.)"
28,
29,[Sarah Jane's car]
30,
31,DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! 
32,"(Suddenly, two figures with honking big guns appear either side of the"
33,car and blast the Daleks.) 
34,SARAH: Mickey? 
35,MICKEY: Us Smiths got to stick together! 
36,"JACKIE: Jackie Tyler, Rose's mum. Now where the hell is my daughter?"
37,
38,[Torchwood]
39,
40,(Gwen and Ianto empty their machinegun clips at the
41,"Dalek, who isn't shooting back. When they stop, they see the bullets"
42,hanging in midair. Gwen touches the air and it ripples like water.) 
43,GWEN: What the hell?
44,
45,[Tardis]
46,
47,(The Doctor checks on his glowing spare hand.) 
48,DOCTOR: There now. 
49,(He blows on the jar and the glowing stops.) 
50,"DOCTOR: You see? Used the regeneration energy to heal myself, but soon"
51,"as I was done, I didn't need to change. I didn't want to. Why would I?"
52,"Look at me. So, to stop the energy going all the way, I siphoned off"
53,"the rest into a handy bio-matching receptacle, namely my hand. My hand"
54,"there. My handy spare hand. Remember? Christmas Day, Sycorax. Lost my"
55,hand in a sword fight? That's my hand. What do you think? 
56,ROSE: You're still you? 
57,DOCTOR: I'm still me. 
58,(The Doctor and Rose hug. Donna turns to Jack.) 
59,"DONNA: You can hug me, if you want. No, really. You can hug me."
60,
61,[Torchwood]
62,
63,(Ianto is checking the data banks.) 
64,IANTO: It's a Time Lock. The ultimate defence programme. Tosh was
65,"working on it. Never thought she finished it, but she did. The Hub's"
66,sealed in a time bubble. Nothing can get in. 
67,GWEN: But that means we can't get out. 
68,IANTO: Nope. Not without unlocking that Dalek. We're trapped inside.
69,It's all up to Jack now.
70,
71,[Street]
72,
73,(The Tardis is in the middle of a litter-strewn
74,"street, surrounded by four Daleks.) "
75,DALEK: Report. Tardis has been located. 
76,[Dalek spaceship]
77,
78,RED DALEK: Bring it here. Bring the Doctor to me!
79,Initiate temporal prison. 
80,[Street]
81,
82,(The four Daleks create a shining blue energy ring
83,around the Tardis.) 
84,DALEK: Temporal prison initiated.
85,
86,[Tardis]
87,
88,(The power goes out.) 
89,DOCTOR: They've got us. Power's gone. Some kind of chronon loop. 
90,(The Tardis tilts with a jerk.) 
91,[Street]
92,
93,"(Sarah, Jackie and Mickey hide behind an abandoned"
94,van.) 
95,DALEK: Transferring Tardis to the Crucible. 
96,(The Tardis is lifted away by an energy beam up into the space between
97,the planets.) 
98,SARAH: Those teleport things. Can we use them? If they've taken the
99,"Doctor to the Dalek spaceship, then that's where we need to be. "
100,"MICKEY: It's not just a teleport, it's a dimension jump. Man, this"
101,thing rips a hole in the fabric of space. 
102,SARAH: But can we use it? 
103,MICKEY: Not yet. It burns up energy. Needs half an hour between jumps. 
104,SARAH: Then put down your guns. 
105,MICKEY: Do what? 
106,"SARAH: If you're carrying a gun, they'll shoot you dead. "
107,(Sarah steps out into the street.) 
108,"SARAH: Daleks, I surrender. "
109,DALEK: All humans in this sector will be taken to the Crucible. 
110,MICKEY: She's bloody mad! 
111,"JACKIE: Yeah, but Mickey, if they've got the Doctor, then they've got"
112,Rose. 
113,(Jackie puts down her gun and walks out.) 
114,JACKIE: And us. We surrender. 
115,(Mickey kisses his gun then follows.)
116,
117,[Francine's home]
118,
119,(Martha puts the Project Indigo backpack on.) 
120,"MARTHA: Now Jack's explained the base code, I know how this teleport"
121,works. I think. But you just stay indoors. There's no Daleks on this
122,"street. You should be all right. Just er, keep quiet. "
123,FRANCINE: But where are you going? 
124,"MARTHA: I'm a member of UNIT, and they gave me the Osterhagen Key. I've"
125,got to do my job. I'm sorry. 
126,FRANCINE: Martha. What's an Osterhagen Key? Tell me. What does it do? 
127,MARTHA: Love you. 
128,(Martha pulls her ripcords and vanishes.)
129,
130,[Germany - 60 miles outside Nuremberg]
131,
132,(Martha lands in a wood. Daleks can be heard
133,shouting their favourite word in German.) 
134,DALEK : Exterminieren! Exterminieren! 
135,DALEK 2 : Halt! Sonst werden wir Sie exterminieren! Sie sind jetzt
136,ein Gefangener der Daleks! 
137,(Martha sees a Dalek patrol gliding above the forest floor.) 
138,DALEK: Exterminieren. Exterminieren.
139,
140,[Tardis]
141,
142,JACK: There's a massive Dalek ship at the centre of
143,the planets. They're calling it the Crucible. Guess that's our
144,destination. 
145,DONNA: You said these planets were like an engine. But what for? 
146,"DOCTOR: Rose, you've been in a parallel world. That world's running"
147,ahead of this universe. You've seen the future. What was it? 
148,ROSE: It's the darkness. 
149,DONNA: The stars were going out. 
150,ROSE: One by one. We looked up at the sky and they were just dying.
151,"Basically, we've been building this, er, this travel machine, this,"
152,"this er, dimension cannon, so I could. Well, so I could "
153,DOCTOR: What? 
154,"ROSE: So I could come back. Shut up. Anyway, suddenly, it started to"
155,"work and the dimensions started to collapse. Not just in our world, not"
156,"just in yours, but the whole of reality. Even the Void was dead."
157,Something is destroying everything. 
158,"DONNA: In that parallel world, you said something about me. "
159,"ROSE: The dimension cannon could measure timelines, and it's, it's"
160,"weird, Donna, but they all seemed to converge on you. "
161,"DONNA: But why me? I mean, what have I ever done? I'm a temp from"
162,Chiswick. 
163,(The scanner beeps.) 
164,DOCTOR: The Dalek Crucible. All aboard.
165,
166,[Crucible]
167,
168,DALEK: The Tardis is secured. 
169,"RED DALEK: Doctor, you will step forth or die. "
170,[Tardis]
171,
172,"DOCTOR: We'll have to go out. Because if we don't,"
173,they'll get in. 
174,ROSE: You told me nothing could get through those doors. 
175,JACK: You've got extrapolator shielding. 
176,"DOCTOR: Last time we fought the Daleks, they were scavengers and"
177,"hybrids, and mad. But this is a fully-fledged Dalek Empire, at the"
178,"height of its power. Experts at fighting Tardises, they can do"
179,"anything. Right now, that wooden door is just wood. "
180,(Donna can hear a heartbeat thumping in her ears.) 
181,JACK: What about your dimension jump? 
182,"ROSE: It needs another twenty minutes. And anyway, I'm not leaving. "
183,DOCTOR: What about your teleport? 
184,JACK: Went down with the power loss. 
185,DOCTOR: Right then. All of us together. Yeah. Donna? 
186,(Donna is staring at nothing. He snaps her out of it.) 
187,DOCTOR: Donna? 
188,DONNA: Yeah. 
189,DOCTOR: I'm sorry. There's nothing else we can do. 
190,"DONNA: No, I know. "
191,[Crucible]
192,
193,"RED DALEK: Surrender, Doctor, and face your Dalek"
194,masters. 
195,DALEK 3: Crucible on maximum alert. 
196,[Tardis]
197,
198,ROSE: Daleks. 
199,"JACK: Oh, God. "
200,"DOCTOR: It's been good, though, hasn't it? All of us. All of it."
201,Everything we did. (to Donna) You were brilliant. (to Jack) And you
202,were brilliant. (to Rose) And you were brilliant. Blimey. 
203,[Crucible]
204,
205,(The Doctor leads his companions out of the Tardis.
206,Donna is lagging behind.) 
207,RED DALEK: Daleks reign supreme. All hail the Daleks! 
208,DALEKS: Daleks reign supreme. All hail the Daleks! Daleks reign
209,supreme. All hail the Daleks! 
210,"(Donna stops inside the Tardis, the heartbeat thumping in her ears. The"
211,Doctor looks up at the phalanxes of Daleks flying around.) 
212,DALEKS: Daleks reign supreme. All hail the Daleks! Daleks reign
213,supreme. All hail the Daleks! 
214,"RED DALEK: Behold, Doctor. Behold the might of the true Dalek race. "
215,DOCTOR: Donna! You're no safer in there. 
216,"(The Tardis door slams shut, trapping Donna inside.) "
217,DOCTOR: What? 
218,[Tardis]
219,
220,DONNA: Doctor? What have you done? 
221,[Crucible]
222,
223,DOCTOR: It wasn't me. I didn't do anything. 
224,[Tardis]
225,
226,"DONNA: Oi! Oi, I'm not staying behind! "
227,[Crucible]
228,
229,DOCTOR: What did you do?! 
230,RED DALEK: This is not of Dalek origin. 
231,[Tardis]
232,
233,DONNA: Doctor! 
234,[Crucible]
235,
236,DOCTOR: Stop it! She's my friend. Now open the door
237,and let her out. 
238,RED DALEK: This is Time Lord treachery. 
239,DOCTOR: Me? The door just closed on its own. 
240,"RED DALEK: Nevertheless, the Tardis is a weapon and it will be"
241,destroyed. 
242,(A trapdoor opens under the Tardis and it drops.) 
243,DOCTOR: What are you doing? Bring it back!
244,
245,[Tardis]
246,
247,DONNA: Doctor!
248,
249,[Crucible]
250,
251,DOCTOR: What have you done? Where's it going? 
252,RED DALEK: The Crucible has a heart of Z-neutrino energy. The Tardis
253,will be deposited into the core. 
254,DOCTOR: You can't. You've taken the defences down. It'll be torn apart!
255,
256,(The Tardis drops into the molten core. Fires break out and roundels
257,explode.) 
258,ROSE: But Donna's still in there! 
259,JACK: Let her go! 
260,RED DALEK: The female and the Tardis will perish together. Observe. The
261,last child of Gallifrey is powerless. 
262,(An image of the Tardis bobbing in the molten core appears.) 
263,DOCTOR: Please. I'm begging you. I'll do anything! Put me in her place.
264,"You can do anything to me, I don't care, just get her out of there! "
265,(The noise of the exploding roundels is replaced by the heartbeat.
266,Donna puts her hand on the spare hand jar. Golden energy flows out and
267,around her until the jar breaks.) 
268,RED DALEK: You are connected to the Tardis. Now feel it die.
269,
270,[Tardis]
271,
272,"(The spare hand is lying on the floor, twitching."
273,"The golden energy surges out and builds a new body for it, which looks"
274,just like the old one.) 
275,DONNA: It's you! 
276,"NEW DOCTOR: Oh, yes! "
277,DONNA: You're naked. 
278,"NEW DOCTOR: Oh, yes."
279,
280,[Crucible]
281,
282,DALEK 3: Total Tardis destruction in ten rels.
283,"Nine, eight, seven, six "
284,(The new Doctor presses a button on the console.) 
285,"DALEK 3: Five, four, three, two, one. "
286,(The Tardis vanishes.) 
287,"RED DALEK: The Tardis has been destroyed. Now tell me, Doctor. What do"
288,you feel? Anger? Sorrow? Despair? 
289,DOCTOR: Yeah. 
290,"RED DALEK: Then if emotions are so important, surely we have enhanced"
291,you? 
292,JACK: Yeah? Feel this!
293,(Jack produces a small revolver and shoots at the Red Dalek.) 
294,RED DALEK: Exterminate! 
295,(The Red Dalek zaps Jack.) 
296,"ROSE: Jack. Oh, my God. Oh, no. "
297,"DOCTOR: Rose, come here. Leave him. "
298,ROSE: They killed him. 
299,DOCTOR: I know. I'm sorry. 
300,RED DALEK: Escort them to the Vault. 
301,DOCTOR: There's nothing we can do. 
302,RED DALEK: They are the playthings of Davros now. 
303,(Jack blinks. The Tardis appears in space.)
304,
305,[Tardis]
306,
307,NEW DOCTOR: All repaired. Lovely. Shush. No one
308,"knows we're here. Got to keep quiet. Silent running, like on submarines"
309,when you can't even drop a spanner. Don't drop a spanner! I like blue.
310,What do you think? 
311,DONNA: You are bonkers. 
312,NEW DOCTOR: Why? What's wrong with blue? 
313,"DONNA: Is that what Time Lords do? Lop a bit off, grow another one?"
314,You're like worms. 
315,"NEW DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. I'm unique. Never been another like me."
316,Because all that regeneration energy went into the hand. Look at my
317,hand. I love that hand. But then you touched it. Wham! Shush.
318,"Instantaneous biological metacrisis. I grew out of you. Still, could be"
319,worse. 
320,"DONNA: Oi, watch it, spaceman. "
321,"NEW DOCTOR: Oi, watch it, Earth girl. Ooo. I sound like you. I sound"
322,"all, all sort of rough. "
323,DONNA: Oi! 
324,NEW DOCTOR: Oi! 
325,DONNA: Oi! 
326,"NEW DOCTOR: Spanners. Shush. I must have picked up a bit of your voice,"
327,"that's all. Is it? Did I? No. Oh, you are kidding me. No way. One"
328,heart. I've only got one heart. This body has got only one heart. 
329,"DONNA: What, like you're human? "
330,"NEW DOCTOR: Oh, that's disgusting. "
331,DONNA: Oi! 
332,NEW DOCTOR: Oi! 
333,DONNA: Stop it. 
334,"NEW DOCTOR: No, wait. I'm part Time Lord, part human. Well, isn't that"
335,wizard? 
336,"DONNA: I kept hearing that noise, that heartbeat. "
337,"NEW DOCTOR: Oh, that was me. My single heart. Because I'm a complicated"
338,"event in time and space. Must have rippled back, converging on you. "
339,DONNA: But why me? 
340,NEW DOCTOR: Because you're special. 
341,"DONNA: Oh, I keep telling you, I'm not. "
342,"NEW DOCTOR: No, but you are. Oh. You really don't believe that, do you?"
343,"I can see, Donna, what you're thinking. All that attitude, all that"
344,"lip, because all this time you think you're not worth it. "
345,DONNA: Stop it. 
346,"NEW DOCTOR: Shouting at the world because no one's listening. Well, why"
347,should they? 
348,DONNA: Doctor? Stop it. 
349,"NEW DOCTOR: But look at what you did. No, it's more than that. It's"
350,like we were always heading for this. You came to the Tardis. And you
351,"found me again. Your granddad. Your car. Donna, your car. You parked"
352,your car right where the Tardis was going land. That's not coincidence
353,at all! We've been blind. Something's been drawing us together for such
354,a long time. 
355,DONNA: But you're talking like destiny. There's no such thing. Is
356,there? 
357,NEW DOCTOR: It's still not finished. It's like the pattern's not
358,complete. The strands are still drawing together. But heading for what?
359,
360,[Outside the Schloss]
361,
362,GERMAN WOMAN: Hier ist niemand. Was immer Sie
363,"wollen, gehen Sie fort. Lassen Sie mich in Ruhe! "
364,MARTHA: Ich heisse Martha Jones. Ich komme von UNIT. Agentin fuenf
365,"sechs sechs sieben eins, von der medizinishen Abteilung. "
366,"GERMAN WOMAN: Es hiess Sie kaemen vorbei. That accent. That is London,"
367,ja? I went to London. Long time ago. 
368,MARTHA: I thought this place was supposed to be guarded. 
369,GERMAN WOMAN: They were soldiers. Boys. I brought them food every day.
370,"But when der Albtraum came from the sky, they went home to die. But not"
371,you. 
372,MARTHA: I've got a job to do. 
373,[UNIT Germany]
374,
375,(The woman follows Martha through the dusty rooms
376,to see her pull down a hanging and enter a code into a large keypad.
377,Then it checks her handprint.) 
378,"GERMAN WOMAN: London. In those days, to see it. So much glamour. I was"
379,so young. I heard the soldiers talking many times. They would speak of
380,"the Osterhagen Key. I think London must be changed now, yes? But still,"
381,the glamour. 
382,(The woman points a gun at Martha as she opens the secure door.) 
383,GERMAN WOMAN: You will not go. 
384,MARTHA: I've got no choice. 
385,"GERMAN WOMAN: I know the Key. What it does. Sie sind der Albtraum,"
386,"nicht die anderen, Sie! Ich sollte Sie umbringen, am besten gleich"
387,jetzt! 
388,MARTHA: Then do it. 
389,(But she can't. Martha steps into a small lift.) 
390,"GERMAN WOMAN: Martha, Zur Hoelle mit Dir! "
391,MARTHA: I know.
392,
393,[Crucible]
394,
395,DALEK: Commence disposal. Incinerate! 
396,(Jack is in a large tub with the other rubbish. It is slid along the
397,floor and a steel door clangs down behind it.) 
398,DALEK: Disposal completed. 
399,"(The Daleks leave. The steel door rises and Jack climbs out, coughing.)"
400,
401,[Osterhagen One]
402,
403,(The lift brings Martha to a small high-tech room.
404,She presses a button.) 
405,MARTHA: This is Osterhagen Station One. My name is Martha Jones. Is
406,there anyone there? Over.
407,
408,[Crucible]
409,
410,DALEK 3: Prisoners now on board the Crucible. They
411,will be taken for testing. 
412,SARAH: One step closer to the Doctor. 
413,[Vault]
414,
415,DAVROS: Activate the holding cells. 
416,(Spotlights shine down on the Doctor and Rose.) 
417,"DAVROS: Excellent. Even when powerless, a Time Lord is best contained. "
418,"DOCTOR: Still scared of me, then? "
419,"DAVROS: It is time we talked, Doctor. After so very long. "
420,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. We're not doing the nostalgia tour. I want"
421,"to know what's happening right here, right now, because the Supreme"
422,"Dalek said Vault, yeah? As in dungeon, cellar, prison. You're not in"
423,"charge of the Daleks, are you? They've got you locked away down here in"
424,"the basement like, what, a servant? Slave? Court jester? "
425,DAVROS: We have an arrangement. 
426,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. No, I've got the word. You're the Dalek's"
427,pet! 
428,"DAVROS: So very full of fire, is he not. And to think you crossed"
429,"entire universes, striding parallel to parallel to find him again. "
430,DOCTOR: Leave her alone. 
431,DAVROS: She is mine to do as I please. 
432,ROSE: Then why am I still alive? 
433,DAVROS: You must be here. It was foretold. Even the Supreme Dalek would
434,not dare to contradict the prophecies of Dalek Caan. 
435,CAAN: So cold and dark. Fire is coming. The endless flames. 
436,ROSE: What is that thing? 
437,DOCTOR: You've met before. The last of the Cult of Skaro. But it flew
438,"into the Time War, unprotected. "
439,DAVROS: Caan did more than that. He saw time. Its infinite complexity
440,"and majesty, raging through his mind. And he saw you. Both of you. "
441,"CAAN: This I have foreseen, in the wild and the wind. The Doctor will"
442,"be here as witness, at the end of everything. The Doctor and his"
443,precious Children of Time. And one of them will die. 
444,"DOCTOR: Was it you, Caan? Did you kill Donna? Why did the Tardis door"
445,close? Tell me! 
446,"DAVROS: Oh, that's it. The anger, the fire, the rage of a Time Lord who"
447,butchered millions. There he is. Why so shy? Show your companion. Show
448,her your true self. Dalek Caan has promised me that too. 
449,"CAAN: I have seen. At the time of ending, the Doctor's soul will be"
450,revealed. 
451,DOCTOR: What does that mean? 
452,DAVROS: We will discover it together. Our final journey. Because the
453,ending approaches. The testing begins. 
454,DOCTOR: Testing of what? 
455,DAVROS: The Reality bomb.
456,
457,[Holding area]
458,
459,DALEK: Prisoners will stand in the designated area.
460,Move! Move! 
461,(One woman falls to her knees.) 
462,WOMAN: Oh! 
463,DALEK: You will stand! 
464,WOMAN: I can't. 
465,DALEK: You will stand! 
466,WOMAN: I can't. Please! 
467,(Sarah spots a nearby door and runs to it.) 
468,DALEK: On your feet. On your feet! 
469,(She opens it with her sonic lipstick.) 
470,SARAH: (sotto) Mickey! Mickey! 
471,MICKEY: (sotto) Jackie! 
472,"(Mickey follows Sarah, but Jackie is with the woman.) "
473,DALEK: Prisoners will stand in the designated area. 
474,[Corridor]
475,
476,MICKEY: We can't just leave her. 
477,"SARAH: No, Mickey. Wait! "
478,(A Dalek glides in front of the bulkhead door.) 
479,WOMAN: What does it mean? What are they testing? What are they going to
480,do? 
481,(There is a big green glowing thing above them.) 
482,JACKIE: I reckon it's that thing there. 
483,[Crucible]
484,
485,RED DALEK: Testing calibration of Reality bomb.
486,"Firing in ten rels. Nine, eight, seven"

490,DAVROS: Behold. The apotheosis of my genius. 
491,(Davros turns on a screen showing the holding area.) 
492,"RED DALEK : Four, three, two, one, zero. "
493,[Crucible]
494,
495,RED DALEK: Activate planetary alignment field.
496,
497,[Tardis]
498,
499,NEW DOCTOR: It's the planets. The twenty seven
500,planets.
501,
502,[Vault]
503,
504,(The planets start to glow.) 
505,"DOCTOR: That's Z-neutrino energy, flattened by the alignment of the"
506,"planets into a single string. No, Davros. Davros, you can't! You can't!"
507,No!
508,
509,[Tardis]
510,
511,NEW DOCTOR: Single string Z-neutrinos compressed.
512,No way.

515,
516,"(Beep, beep, beep!) "
517,MICKEY: Thirty minutes. It's recharged! 
518,[Holding area]
519,
520,(Mickey shouts to Jackie through the glass porthole
521,in the door.) 
522,MICKEY: (sotto) It's recharged! It's recharged! Use it! 
523,JACKIE: I'm so sorry. 
524,(Jackie vanishes and reappears with Mickey. They watch as the rest of
525,the prisoners gently atomise from the head downwards.)
526,
527,[Holding area]
528,
529,DALEK: Test completed.
530,
531,[Tardis]
532,
533,"DONNA: What was it? Doctor, what did it do?"
534,
535,[Vault]
536,
537,"ROSE: Doctor, what happened? "
538,"DAVROS: Electrical energy, Miss Tyler. Every atom in existence is bound"
539,by an electrical field. The Reality bomb cancels it out. Structure
540,falls apart. That test was focused on the prisoners alone. Full
541,transmission will dissolve every form of matter. 
542,ROSE: The stars are going out. 
543,"DOCTOR: The twenty seven planets. They become one vast transmitter,"
544,blasting that wavelength. 
545,"DAVROS: Across the entire universe. Never stopping, never faltering,"
546,"never fading. People and planets and stars will become dust, and the"
547,"dust will become atoms, and the atoms will become nothing. And the"
548,"wavelength will continue, breaking through the Rift at the heart of the"
549,"Medusa Cascade into every dimension, every parallel, every single"
550,"corner of creation. This is my ultimate victory, Doctor! The"
551,destruction of reality itself!
552,
553,[Crucible]
554,
555,RED DALEK: Prepare for universal detonation. The
556,fleet will gather at the Crucible. All Daleks will return to shelter
557,from the cataclysm. We will become the only life forms in existence.
558,
559,[Chiswick]

561,"SYLVIA: Look, they're leaving. Dad, they're going."
562,The Daleks are going! 
563,"WILF: Going where, though? And Donna's still out there. It's not over"
564,"yet, sweetheart."
565,
566,[Corridor]
567,
568,(Jack rolls through a panel in the wall behind
569,"Sarah, Jackie and Mickey.) "
570,"JACK: Just my luck. I climb through two miles of ventilation shafts,"
571,"chasing life signs on this thing, and who do I find? Mickey Mouse. "
572,"MICKEY: You can talk, Captain Cheesecake. "
573,(Mickey and Jack hug.) 
574,JACK: Good to see you. And that's Beefcake. 
575,MICKEY: And that's enough hugging. 
576,"JACK: We meet at last, Miss Smith. "
577,SARAH: There is something we can do. You've got to understand. I have a
578,son down there on Earth. He's only fourteen years old. I've brought
579,this. 
580,(Sarah holds up a sparkling gem on a chain.) 
581,"SARAH: It was given to me by a Verron Soothsayer. He said, this is for"
582,the End of Days. 
583,JACK: Is that a Warp Star? 
584,MICKEY: Going to tell me what a Warp Star is? 
585,JACK: A warpfold conjugation trapped in a carbonised shell. It's an
586,"explosion, Mickey. An explosion waiting to happen."
587,
588,[Osterhagen One]
589,
590,ANNA [on screen]: This is Osterhagen Station Five.
591,"Are you receiving, Station One? "
592,"MARTHA: I've got you. That makes three of us, and three is all we need."
593,
594,[Osterhagen Five]
595,
596,(In the People's Republic of China.) 
597,"ANNA: My name is Anna Zhou, what's yours? "
598,MARTHA : Martha Jones. 
599,[Osterhagen One]
600,
601,"MARTHA: What about you, Station Four? You never"
602,said. 
603,"LIBERIA [on screen]: I don't want my name on this, given what we're"
604,about to do. 
605,ANNA [on screen]: So what happens now? Do we do it? 
606,MARTHA: No. Not yet. 
607,"ANNA [on screen]: UNIT instructions say, once three Osterhagen Stations"
608,are online 
609,"MARTHA: Yeah, but I've got a higher authority, way above UNIT. And"
610,there's one more thing the Doctor would do.
611,
612,[Tardis]
613,
614,(He builds a gizmo.) 
615,DONNA: So what is this thing? 
616,NEW DOCTOR: It's our only hope. A Z-neutrino biological inversion
617,catalyser. 
618,"DONNA: Yeah. Earth girl, remember? "
619,NEW DOCTOR: Davros said he built those Daleks out of himself. His
620,genetic code runs through the entire race. If I can use this to lock
621,the Crucible's transmission onto Davros himself 
622,DONNA: It destroys the Daleks? 
623,NEW DOCTOR: Biggest backfire in history.
624,
625,[Crucible]
626,
627,DALEK: Incoming transmission. Origin Planet Earth. 
628,RED DALEK: Display! 
629,"MARTHA [on screen]: This is Martha Jones, representing the Unified"

631,RED DALEK: Send transmission to the Vault. Continue to monitor.
632,
633,[Vault]
634,
635,MARTHA [on screen]: This message is for the Dalek
636,Crucible. Repeat. Can you hear me? 
637,DOCTOR: Put me through. 
638,DAVROS: It begins As Dalek Caan foretold. 
639,"CAAN: The Children of Time will gather, and one of them will die. "
640,DOCTOR: Stop saying that. Put me through! 
641,"MARTHA [on screen]: Doctor! I'm sorry, I had to. "
642,"DAVROS: Oh, but the Doctor is powerless. My prisoner. State your"
643,intent. 
644,[Osterhagen One]
645,
646,MARTHA: I've got the Osterhagen Key. Leave this
647,planet and its people alone 
648,[Vault]
649,
650,MARTHA [on screen]: Or I'll use it. 
651,DOCTOR: Osterhagen what? What's an Osterhagen Key? 
652,MARTHA [on screen]: There's a chain of twenty five nuclear warheads
653,"placed in strategic points beneath the Earth's crust. If I use the key,"
654,they detonate and the Earth gets ripped apart. 
655,"DOCTOR: What? Who invented that? Well, someone called Osterhagen, I"
656,"suppose. Martha, are you insane?"
657,
658,[Osterhagen One]
659,
660,MARTHA: The Osterhagen Key is to be used if the
661,"suffering of the human race is so great, so without hope, that this"
662,becomes the final option.
663,
664,[Vault]
665,
666,DOCTOR: That's never an option.
667,
668,[Osterhagen One]
669,
670,"MARTHA: Don't argue with me, Doctor! "
671,[Vault]
672,
673,MARTHA [on screen]: Because it's more than that.
674,"Now, I reckon the Daleks need "
675,[Osterhagen One]
676,
677,MARTHA: These twenty seven planets for something.
678,But what if it becomes twenty six? 
679,[Vault]
680,
681,MARTHA [on screen]: What happens then? Daleks?
682,Would you risk it? 
683,ROSE: She's good. 
684,MARTHA [on screen]: Who's that? 
685,ROSE: My name's Rose. Rose Tyler.

720,SARAH: We had no choice. We saw what happened to
721,the prisoners.

725,DAVROS: Impossible. That face. 
726,[Corridor]

756,

758,DAVROS: And the prophecy unfolds. 
759,CAAN: The Doctor's soul is revealed. See him. See the heart of him. 
760,"DAVROS: The man who abhors violence, never carrying a gun. "
761,[Corridor]
762,
763,"DAVROS : But this is the truth, Doctor. You"
764,take ordinary people 
765,[Vault]

773,DAVROS: Transformed into murderers. I made the
774,"Daleks, Doctor. You made this. "
775,DOCTOR: They're trying to help. 
776,"DAVROS: Already I have seen them sacrifice today, for their beloved"
777,Doctor. The Earth woman who fell opening the Subwave Network. 
778,DOCTOR: Who was that? 
779,ROSE: Harriet Jones. She gave her life to get you here. 
780,DAVROS: How many more? Just think. How many have died in your name? 
781,"(A lot, and that's just in these few modern series, including River"
782,"Song and his daughter, although we know better.) "
783,"DAVROS: The Doctor. The man who keeps running, never looking back"
784,"because he dare not, out of shame. This is my final victory, Doctor. I"
785,have shown you yourself.

887,DAVROS: Exterminate her! 
888,DALEKS: Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate.

894,NEW DOCTOR: Time Lord. Part Time Lord.

899,"DONNA: Holding cells deactivated. And seal the Vault. Well, don't just"
900,"stand there, you skinny boys in suits. Get to work. "

903,(The Daleks spin around on the spot.) 
904,DALEK: Help me. Help me! 
905,DONNA: And the other way. 
906,NEW DOCTOR: What did you do? 
907,DONNA: Trip switch circuit-breaker in the psychokinetic threshold
908,manipulator. 
909,NEW DOCTOR: But that's brilliant! 
910,DOCTOR: Why did we never think of that? 
911,"DONNA: Because you two were just Time Lords, you dumbos, lacking that"
912,little bit of human. That gut instinct that comes hand in hand with
913,Planet Earth. I can think of ideas you two couldn't dream of in a
914,"million years. Ah, the universe has been waiting for me. Now, let's"
915,"send that trip switch all over the ship. Did I ever tell you, best temp"
916,in Chiswick? Hundred words per minute.

935,"MICKEY: Just stay where you are, mister. "
936,JACK: Out of the way.

940,"ROSE: Oh, you too. "
941,DONNA: Ready? And reverse. 
942,"(Donna and the Doctors pull out pairs of rods, and the planets"
943,disappear one by one.)

946,"DONNA: Shallacatop, Pyrovillia and the Lost Moon of Poosh. Sorted. Ha! "
947,NEW DOCTOR: Ha! 
948,DOCTOR: We need more power! 
949,ROSE: Is anyone going to tell us what's going on? 
950,DONNA: He poured all his regeneration energy into his spare hand. I
951,"touched the hand, and he grew out of that but that fed back into me."
952,"But, it just stayed dormant in my head till the synapses got that"
953,"little extra spark, kicking them into life. Thank you, Davros! Part"
954,"human, part Time Lord. And I got the best bit of the Doctor. I got his"
955,mind. 
956,SARAH: So there's three of you? 
957,ROSE: Three Doctors? 
958,JACK: I can't tell you what I'm thinking right now. 
959,DOCTOR: You're so unique the timelines were converging on you. Human
960,being with a Time Lord brain. 
961,"DAVROS: But you promised me, Dalek Caan. Why did you not foresee this? "
962,"DOCTOR: Oh, I think he did. Something's been manipulating the timelines"
963,"for ages, getting Donna Noble to the right place at the right time. "
964,"CAAN: This would always have happened. I only helped, Doctor. "
965,DAVROS: You betrayed the Daleks. 
966,"CAAN: I saw the Daleks. What we have done, throughout time and space, I"
967,"saw the truth of us, Creator, and I decreed, no more! "
968,[Crucible]

974,JACK: Heads up! 
975,"RED DALEK: Davros, you have betrayed us. "
976,DAVROS: It was Dalek Caan. 
977,RED DALEK: The Vault will be purged. You will all be exterminated. 
978,(The Red Dalek zaps the control panel.) 
979,"JACK: Like I was saying, feel this! "
980,(Jack fires an extended pulse from his big gun and the Red Dalek
981,explodes.) 
982,"DOCTOR: Oh, we've lost the magnetron. And there's only one planet left."
983,"Oh, guess which one. But we can use the Tardis. "
984,(The Doctor runs into the Tardis.) 
985,NEW DOCTOR: Holding Earth stability. Maintaining atmospheric shell. 
986,CAAN: The prophecy must complete. 
987,DAVROS: Don't listen to him. 
988,"CAAN: I have seen the end of everything Dalek, and you must make it"
989,"happen, Doctor. "
990,"NEW DOCTOR: He's right. Because with or without a Reality bomb, this"
991,Dalek Empire's big enough to slaughter the cosmos. They've got to be
992,stopped. 
993,"DONNA: Just, just wait for the Doctor. "
994,NEW DOCTOR: I am the Doctor. Maximising Dalekanium power feeds.
995,Blasting them back! 
996,(Daleks start exploding all over the Crucible and all over the Medusa
997,Cascade. The Doctor runs out of the Tardis.)

1000,[Torchwood]

1015,
1016,(Explosions are starting to wreck the Vault.) 
1017,DOCTOR: Davros? Come with me. I promise I can save you. 
1018,"DAVROS: Never forget, Doctor, you did this. I name you. Forever, you"

1020,(A wall of flames leaps up and Davros gurgles his last scream.) 
1021,CAAN: One will still die.
1022,
1023,[Tardis]
1024,
1025,DOCTOR: And off we go. 
1026,(The Tardis dematerialises. The Crucible goes KaBOOM!) 
1027,SARAH: But what about the Earth? It's stuck in the wrong part of space.
1028,
1029,"DOCTOR: I'm on it. Torchwood Hub, this is the Doctor. Are you receiving"
1030,me?
1031,
1032,[Torchwood]
1033,
1034,GWEN: Loud and clear. 
1035,[Tardis]
1036,
1037,GWEN [on scanner]: Is Jack there? 
1038,"DOCTOR: Can't get rid of him. Jack, what's her name? "
1039,JACK: Gwen Cooper. 
1040,"DOCTOR: Tell me, Gwen Cooper, "
1041,[Torchwood]
1042,
1043,DOCTOR [on screen]: Are you from an old Cardiff
1044,family? 
1045,"GWEN: Yes, all the way back to the eighteen hundreds."
1046,
1047,[Tardis]
1048,
1049,"DOCTOR: Ah, thought so. Spatial genetic"
1050,multiplicity. 
1051,"ROSE: Oh, yeah. "
1052,"DOCTOR: Yeah, it's a funny old world. Now, Torchwood, I want you to"
1053,open up that 
1054,[Torchwood]
1055,
1056,DOCTOR [on screen]: Rift Manipulator. Send all the
1057,power to me. 
1058,[Torchwood]
1059,
1060,"IANTO [on scanner]: Doing it now, sir. "
1061,GWEN: What's that for? 
1062,"DOCTOR: It's a tow rope. Now then. Sarah, what was your son's name? "
1063,SARAH: Luke. He's called Luke. And the computer's called Mister Smith. 
1064,DOCTOR: Calling Luke and Mister Smith. 
1065,[Sarah Jane's home]
1066,
1067,"DOCTOR : This is the Doctor. Come on, Luke."
1068,Shake a leg. 
1069,LUKE: Is Mum there?
1070,
1071,[Tardis]
1072,
1073,"DOCTOR: Oh, she's fine and dandy. "
1074,SARAH: Yes! Yes! 
1075,"DOCTOR: Now, Mister Smith, I want you to harness the Rift power and"
1076,loop it around the Tardis. You got that? 
1077,MR SMITH : I regret I will need remote access to Tardis base code
1078,numerals. 
1079,"DOCTOR: Oh, blimey, that's going to take a while. "
1080,"SARAH: No, no, no. Let me. K9, out you come! "
1081,[Sarah Jane's home]
1082,
1083,(K9 beams in beside Luke.) 
1084,"K9: Affirmative, Mistress. "
1085,"DOCTOR : Oh! Oh ho! Oh, good dog! "
1086,[Tardis]
1087,
1088,"DOCTOR: K9, give Mister Smith the base code."
1089,
1090,[Sarah Jane's home]
1091,
1092,K9: Master. Tardis base code now being transferred.
1093,
1094,[Tardis]
1095,
1096,K9 : The process is simple. 
1097,"DOCTOR: Now then, you lot. Sarah, hold that down. Mickey, you hold"
1098,that. Because you know why this Tardis always is always rattling about
1099,"the place? Rose? That, there. It's designed to have six pilots, and I"
1100,"have to do it single handed. Martha, keep that level. But not any more."
1101,"Jack, there you go. Steady that. Now we can fly this thing. No, Jackie."
1102,"No, no. Not you. Don't touch anything. Just stand back. Like it's meant"
1103,to be flown. We've got the Torchwood Rift looped around the Tardis by
1104,"Mister Smith, and we're"
1105,going to fly Planet Earth back home. Right then. Off we go. 
1106,"(The Tardis takes the strain on the tow rope, then pulls Earth out of"
1107,the Cascade. Everyone on Earth hangs on for the ride. Donna walks
1108,"around the console, supervising the flight.) "
1109,"DONNA: That's really good, Jack. I think you're the best. "
1110,"(The Tardis drops the Earth off by the Moon, and everyone celebrates.) "
1111,JACKIE: Good job! 
1112,"(Donna pulls Jack off Sarah and hugs him herself. On Earth, the news"
1113,"tickers report the obvious, and fireworks celebrations happen without"
1114,any set up or planning whatsoever.) 
1115,[Park]
1116,
1117,(Church bells are ringing a celebratory change.) 
1118,"SARAH: You know, you act like such a lonely man. But look at you."
1119,You've got the biggest family on Earth. 
1120,(Sarah and the Doctor hug.) 
1121,SARAH: Oh! Got to go. He's only fourteen. It's a long story. And thank
1122,you!
1123,
1124,[Tardis]
1125,
1126,(Donna is phoning home.) 
1127,"DONNA: Yeah, I'm fine. Are you all right? "
1128,MICKEY: I'm going to miss you more than anyone. 
1129,"JACKIE: What do you mean? The Doctor's going to take us home, isn't he?"
1130,
1131,"MICKEY: Well, that's the point."
1132,
1133,[Park]
1134,
1135,(The Doctor unmends Jack's teleport bracelet.) 
1136,"DOCTOR: I told you, no teleport. And, Martha, get rid of that"
1137,"Osterhagen thing, eh? Save the world one more time. "
1138,MARTHA: Consider it done. 
1139,"(They both salute the Doctor, and he returns it. Jack and Martha walk"
1140,away.) 
1141,"JACK: You know, I'm not sure about UNIT these days. Maybe there's"
1142,something else you could be doing? 
1143,(Mickey comes out of the Tardis.) 
1144,"DOCTOR: Oi, where are you going? "
1145,"MICKEY: Well, I'm not stupid. I can work out what happens next. And"
1146,"hey, I had a good time in that parallel world, but my gran passed away."
1147,Nice and peaceful. She spent her last years living in a mansion.
1148,"There's nothing there for me now, certainly not Rose. "
1149,DOCTOR: What will you do? 
1150,"MICKEY: Anything. Brand new life. Just you watch. See you, boss. Hey,"
1151,you two! 
1152,(Mickey catches up with Jack and Martha.) 
1153,JACK: Oh. Thought I'd got rid of you.
1154,
1155,[Tardis]
1156,
1157,DOCTOR: Just time for one last trip. D�rlig Ulv
1158,Stranden. Better known as
1159,
1160,[D�rlig Ulv Stranden]
1161,
1162,(The Tardis materialises on the beach of Bad Wolf
1163,Bay. The New Doctor and Jackie are first out.) 
1164,"JACKIE: Oh, fat lot of good this is. Back of beyond. Bloody Norway? I'm"
1165,going to
1166,"have to phone your father. He's on the nursery run. I was pregnant, do"
1167,you remember? Had a baby boy. 
1168,"NEW DOCTOR: Oh, brilliant. What did you call him? "
1169,JACKIE: Doctor. 
1170,NEW DOCTOR: Really? 
1171,"JACKIE: No, you plum. He's called Tony. "
1172,"ROSE: Hold on, this is the parallel universe, right? "
1173,DOCTOR: You're back home. 
1174,"DONNA: And the walls of the world are closing again, now that the"
1175,"Reality Bomb never happened. It's dimensional retroclosure. See, I"
1176,really get that stuff now. 
1177,"ROSE: No, but I spent all that time trying to find you. I'm not going"
1178,back now. 
1179,"DOCTOR: But you've got to. Because we saved the universe, but at a"
1180,cost. And the cost is him. He destroyed the Daleks. He committed
1181,genocide. He's too dangerous to be left on his own. 
1182,NEW DOCTOR: You made me. 
1183,"DOCTOR: Exactly. You were born in battle, full of blood and anger and"
1184,"revenge. Remind you of someone? That's me, when we first met. And you"
1185,made me better. Now you can do the same for him. 
1186,ROSE: But he's not you. 
1187,DOCTOR: He needs you. That's very me. 
1188,"DONNA: But it's better than that, though. Don't you see what he's"
1189,trying to give you? Tell her. Go on. 
1190,"NEW DOCTOR: I look like him and I think like him. Same memories, same"
1191,"thoughts, same everything. Except I've only got one heart. "
1192,ROSE: Which means? 
1193,"NEW DOCTOR: I'm part human. Specifically, the aging part. I'll grow old"
1194,"and never regenerate. I've only got one life, Rose Tyler. I could spend"
1195,"it with you, if you want. "
1196,ROSE: You'll grow old at the same time as me? 
1197,NEW DOCTOR: Together. 
1198,(The Tardis time motor revs.) 
1199,DOCTOR: We've got to go. This reality is sealing itself off for ever. 
1200,"ROSE: But, it's still not right, because the Doctor's still you. "
1201,DOCTOR: And I'm him. 
1202,"ROSE: All right. Both of you, answer me this. When I last stood on this"
1203,"beach, on the worst day of my life, what was the last thing you said to"
1204,"me? Go on, say it. "
1205,"DOCTOR: I said, Rose Tyler. "
1206,"ROSE: Yeah, and how was that sentence going to end? "
1207,DOCTOR: Does it need saying? 
1208,"ROSE: And you, Doctor? What was the end of that sentence? "
1209,"(The new Doctor whispers the three little words in Rose's ear, and she"
1210,kisses him. The Doctor and Donna take the opportunity to get into the
1211,Tardis. It dematerialises.)
1212,
1213,[Tardis]
1214,
1215,DONNA: I thought we could try the planet Felspoon.
1216,"Just because. What a good name, Felspoon. Apparently, it's got"
1217,mountains that sway in the breeze. Mountains that move. Can you
1218,imagine? 
1219,DOCTOR: And how do you know that? 
1220,"DONNA: Because it's in your head. And if it's in your head, it's in"
1221,mine. 
1222,DOCTOR: And how does that feel? 
1223,"DONNA: Brilliant! Fantastic! Molto bene! Great big universe, packed"
1224,into my brain. You know you could fix that chameleon circuit if you
1225,"just tried hotbinding the fragment links and superseding the binary,"
1226,"binary, binary, binary, binary, binary, binary, binary, binary, binary,"
1227,"binary, binary, binary, binary. (gasp) I'm fine. Nah, never mind"
1228,Felspoon. You know who I'd like to meet? Charlie Chaplin. I bet he's
1229,"great, Charlie Chaplin. Shall we do that? Shall we go and see Charlie"
1230,"Chaplin? Shall we? Charlie Chaplin? Charlie Chester. Charlie Brown. No,"
1231,"he's fiction. Friction, fiction, fixing, mixing, Rickston, Brixton. "
1232,(This time it hurts.) 
1233,"DONNA: Oh, my God. "
1234,DOCTOR: Do you know what's happening? 
1235,DONNA: Yeah. 
1236,DOCTOR: There's never been a human Time Lord metacrisis before now. And
1237,you know why. 
1238,DONNA: Because there can't be. I want to stay. 
1239,"DOCTOR: Look at me. Donna, look at me. "
1240,DONNA: I was going to be with you forever. 
1241,DOCTOR: I know. 
1242,"DONNA: The rest of my life, travelling in the Tardis. The Doctor Donna."
1243,"No. Oh my god. I can't go back. Don't make me go back. Doctor, please,"
1244,please don't make me go back. 
1245,"DOCTOR: Donna. Oh, Donna Noble. I am so sorry. But we had the best of"
1246,times. 
1247,DONNA: No. 
1248,DOCTOR: The best. Goodbye. 
1249,"DONNA: No, no, no. Please. Please. No. No. "
1250,(The Doctor mind melds with Donna and takes her memories away.) 
1251,DONNA: No! 
1252,(Donna passes out.) 
1253,[Nobles' home]
1254,
1255,(There is a knocking at the door.) 
1256,WILF: That must be her. Donna? 
1257,(The Tardis is parked across the road. The Doctor is kneeling by the
1258,"door, holding the"
1259,unconscious Donna.) 
1260,DOCTOR: Help me. 
1261,WILF: Donna? Donna? 
1262,"(They lay Donna on her bed, then go downstairs. A thunderstorm rolls"
1263,overhead.) 
1264,[Sitting room]
1265,
1266,DOCTOR: She took my mind into her own head. But
1267,"that's a Time Lord consciousness. All that knowledge, it was killing"
1268,her. 
1269,WILF: But she'll get better now? 
1270,"DOCTOR: I had to wipe her mind completely. Every trace of me, or the"
1271,"Tardis, anything we did together, anywhere we went, had to go. "
1272,WILF: All those wonderful things she did. 
1273,DOCTOR: I know. But that version of Donna is dead. Because if she
1274,"remembers, just for a second, she'll burn up. You can never tell her."
1275,You can't mention me or any of it for the rest of her life. 
1276,SYLVIA: But the whole world's talking about it. We travelled across
1277,space. 
1278,"DOCTOR: It'll just be a story. One of those Donna Noble stories, where"
1279,she missed it all again. 
1280,WILF: But she was better with you. 
1281,SYLVIA: Don't say that. 
1282,"WILF: No, she was. "
1283,"DOCTOR: I just want you to know there are worlds out there, safe in the"
1284,"sky because of her. That there are people living in the light, and"
1285,"singing songs of Donna Noble, a thousand million light years away. They"
1286,"will never forget her, while she can never remember. And for one"
1287,"moment, one shining moment, she was the most important woman in the"
1288,whole wide universe. 
1289,SYLVIA: She still is. She's my daughter. 
1290,DOCTOR: Then maybe you should tell her that once in a while. 
1291,"DONNA: I was asleep on my bed in my clothes, like a flipping kid! What"
1292,do you let me do that for? Don't mind me. Donna. 
1293,(Donna checks her mobile.) 
1294,DOCTOR: John Smith. 
1295,SYLVIA: Mister Smith was just leaving. 
1296,DONNA: My phone's gone mad. Thirty two texts. Veena's gone barmy. She's
1297,saying planets in the sky. What have I missed now? Nice to meet you. 
1298,(Donna leaves the room.) 
1299,"SYLVIA: As I said, I think you should go."
1300,
1301,[Kitchen]
1302,
1303,(Donna is on the phone.) 
1304,"DONNA: How thick do you think I am? Planets. Tell you what that was,"
1305,dumbo. That's those two for one lagers you gets down the offy because
1306,"you fancy that little man in there with the goatee. Ha ha! Yes, you do."
1307,I've seen you. 
1308,DOCTOR: Donna? I was just going. 
1309,"DONNA: Yeah, see you. I tell you what though, you're wasting your time"
1310,"with that one, because Susie Mair, she went on that dating site, and"
1311,"she saw him. No, no, no, no. Listen, listen, this is important. Susie"
1312,Mair wouldn't lie. Not unless it was about calories. Ha ha ha!
1313,
1314,[Outside the Nobles' home]
1315,
1316,(It is pouring with rain.) 
1317,DOCTOR: Ah. You'll have quite a bit of this. Atmospheric disturbance.
1318,"Still, it'll pass. Everything does. Bye then, Wilfred. "
1319,"WILF: Oh, Doctor? What about you now? Who've you got? I mean, all those"
1320,friends of yours. 
1321,"DOCTOR: They've all got someone else. Still, that's fine. I'm fine. "
1322,"WILF: I'll watch out for you, sir. "
1323,DOCTOR: You can't ever tell her. 
1324,"WILF: No, no, no. But every night, Doctor, when it gets dark, and the"
1325,"stars come out, I'll look up on her behalf. I'll look up at the sky,"
1326,and think of you. 
1327,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
1328,"(Soaked to the skin, the Doctor squelches to the Tardis. Wilf salutes"
1329,as it dematerialises.)
