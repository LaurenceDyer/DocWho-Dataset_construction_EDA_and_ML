18,One 
19, (A structure with a pair of steel doors sits
20,incongruously in the steaming alien jungle on the reddish brown planet.
21,A slim human with a white beard comes out and plants a sign at the head
22,of a mound off to the left of the structure. The sign reads - Egard
23,"Lumb died here 7y2 in the year 37,166. It is not the only grave marker"
24,we can see.) 
25, [Mine] 
26, (A young man collects crystals and puts them into
27,a machine which pulverises them. He passes the remains over to another
28,man then goes to answer the radio.) 
29,BALDWIN: Yep?
30, [Expedition base]
31,
32, BRAUN: Base checking. You all right out there? 
33,BALDWIN : All quiet. 
34, [Mine] 
35, BRAUN : Where are you? 
36,BALDWIN: Sector five. We've hit a rich load. 
37, [Expedition base]
38,
39," BRAUN: Sector five? Listen, I just took a sun"
40,shot. You have fifteen degrees to full night. You'd better get out of
41,there fast. 
42, [Mine] 
43," BALDWIN: Right. Professor, that was Braun. We've"
44,got to leave. 
45,SORENSON: What? 
46,BALDWIN: It's fifteen degrees to night. 
47,"SORENSON: Just look at this, Baldwin. It's showing more than seventy"
48,pure. 
49,"BALDWIN: We'll never make base from here, sir, if we don't leave now. "
50,"SORENSON: The last time we hit a vein as rich as this, you know what"
51,happened? 
52,BALDWIN: Yes. Lorenzo died. He was the first. That's when it all seemed
53,to start. 
54,SORENSON: We lost it. The vein vanished. This damned planet took it
55,"back. It's alive, you know, Baldwin. It watches every move we make. I"
56,won't be beaten again. Load the canisters. 
57,"BALDWIN: Professor, please. There isn't time now. We can return"
58,tomorrow. 
59,"SORENSON: It'll be gone by tomorrow. Don't you see, man? It knows. It"
60,senses what we're trying to do. 
61,BALDWIN: I'm not trekking back through that jungle in the dark. If you
62,"don't come now, I shall have to leave you. "
63,"SORENSON: Well, then, leave. Leave. "
64,"(Back at base, Braun checks his chronometer, takes a rifle from the"
65,wall and goes outside. Something crackles in the jungle nearby. Braun
66,"backs away, frightened, then falls. He appears to be trying to push"
67,"away something heavy but invisible, then he vanishes. The crackling"
68,fades away.) 
69, [Outside  Expedition
70,base] 
71, (Baldwin splashes his way through a swampy section
72,of jungle in the dark and makes it safely back to Base.) 
73,BALDWIN: Braun? Braun? 
74, [Expedition base]
75,
76, BALDWIN: Sorenson wouldn't come. He. Braun? Where
77,are you? 
78,(The crackling sound starts up. Baldwin manages to press a panic button
79,before it pushes him into a rear compartment and down onto the floor.
80,"Still struggling, Baldwin fades away.) "
81, [Tardis] 
82, (The Doctor is working the console while Sarah
83,checks her watch.) 
84,SARAH: How long have we been travelling? 
85,DOCTOR: Hmm? What did you say? 
86,SARAH: You promised me we'd be back in London five minutes before
87,leaving Loch Ness. 
88,DOCTOR: Did I? 
89,"SARAH: Oh, you're trying to wriggle out of it. "
90,DOCTOR: Wriggle out of what? 
91,SARAH: Your promise. 
92,"DOCTOR: Listen, we're on the edge of a time-space vortex and you're"
93,talking in minutes. 
94,"SARAH: Oh, I see. What's gone wrong this time? "
95,DOCTOR: Nothing. Nothing at all. What makes you think something's gone
96,wrong? 
97,SARAH: Because you always get rude when you're trying to cover up a
98,mistake. 
99,"DOCTOR: Nothing of consequence. Slight overshoot, easily rectified. "
100,"SARAH: Come on, where are we? "
101,"DOCTOR: We've come out of the time vortex at the wrong point, that's"
102,all. A few years too late. 
103,SARAH: How many? 
104,DOCTOR: Thirty thousand. 
105,(A beeping sound starts up.) 
106,SARAH: That's a distress call. 
107,DOCTOR: Someone's in trouble. 
108,SARAH: Where? 
109,DOCTOR: Who knows? Stand by for emergency materialisation. 
110, [Jungle] 
111," (The Tardis materialises and the Doctor looks out,"
112,then steps out holding his direction finder. Sarah follows.) 
113,SARAH: Which way? 
114,DOCTOR: This way. 
115,(A little further on.) 
116,SARAH: You don't know where we are. 
117,"DOCTOR: Oh, with any luck, we're near enough to reach wherever it is. "
118,SARAH: That is not what I meant. 
119,DOCTOR: Before whatever it was that made them transmit the call
120,"overwhelms them. That is, if we're not too late already. "
121,"SARAH: I mean, what planet? "
122,"DOCTOR: Oh, it's a weak signal. Allowing for the fact of interference"
123,"from the time warp, could you move any faster? "
124,SARAH: I'm doing the best I can. 
125,"(The crackling starts up and Sarah becomes rigid, her fingers stretched"
126,out.) 
127, [Space probe command area] 
128, (A craft approaches the planet.) 
129,"VISHINSKY: There it is, Zeta Minor. The last planet of the known"
130,universe. 
131,(He walks up steps at the back of the bridge to where Prentis Hancock
132,sits at a glass table.) 
133,"SALAMAR: Crew deck, orbital entry imminent. Ponti and de Haan to"
134,"command area. Ponti and de Haan to command area. Vishinsky, you'll lead"
135,the landing party. 
136,VISHINSKY: Without Ponti? 
137,SALAMAR: You are the most experienced officer. 
138,VISHINSKY: You are going to scan first? 
139,SALAMAR: No. 
140,VISHINSKY: It's advised procedure before physical landing on any
141,ex-planet. 
142,"SALAMAR: Technically, Zeta Minor is not an ex-planet. Professor"
143,Sorenson's party's been on the surface for months. 
144,VISHINSKY: They might have been dead for months. They've not reported. 
145,"SALAMAR: Vishinsky, you know our fuel position. We've enough for the"
146,return journey and an emergency reserve. I cannot waste that on a low
147,level scan. 
148,"VISHINSKY: It's your decision, Controller. I'll get equipped for"
149,descent. 
150, [Jungle] 
151, (The Doctor notices Sarah is not moving. The
152,crackling has stopped.) 
153,DOCTOR: Sarah? You all right? What's the matter? 
154,"SARAH: I don't know. Just suddenly felt so odd, as though my mind left"
155,my body. 
156,DOCTOR: Are you all right now? 
157,SARAH: Yes. 
158,DOCTOR: You look all right. 
159,SARAH: Yeah. What's that you've found? 
160,DOCTOR: Hand tool of some kind. 
161,"(Like a pick axe, but all metal.) "
162,"SARAH: So the people who sent that signal must be humanoid. Well, if"
163,they've got hands? 
164, [Space probe command area] 
165, (Two armed men enter the control area and the
166,Controller goes down to speak to them.) 
167,"SALAMAR: The descent chamber's ready, Ponti. "
168,"PONTI: (Jamaican) Yes, Controller. "
169,SALAMAR: The probe will remain in free orbit in case emergency escape
170,"procedures are needed. From the time you land, maintain permanent audio"
171,contact. 
172,"DE HAAN: Understood, Controller. "
173,"SALAMAR: The descent area is the one selected for Sorenson, so you"
174,should have no difficulty locating the base. 
175,VISHINSKY: Unless something gets in our way. 
176,SALAMAR: You're equipped and trained to deal with all normal
177,contingencies. The prime purpose of this mission is to locate Professor
178,Sorenson's expedition. If hostile forces are found to be operating on
179,"Zeta Minor, we've the capacity to eliminate them. "
180,(An alarm sounds.) 
181,"SALAMAR: Right, we're in orbit. Prepare for descent. "
182,"(Vishinsky, Ponti and de Haan enter Compression Area Z2.) "
183, [Outside the  Expedition
184,base] 
185, (The Doctor and Sarah arrive at the graveyard and
186,find a desiccated corpse on the ground.) 
187,SARAH: Looks like we're too late. 
188,"DOCTOR: Several months too late, by the look of him."
189, [Expedition base]
190,
191, (It is dark inside.) 
192,DOCTOR: Anyone about? No one about. 
193,SARAH: Can't we have some lights? 
194,DOCTOR: Probably the power's run down. 
195,SARAH: That would account for the weak signal. 
196,DOCTOR: Yes. Ah. 
197,SARAH: What? 
198,DOCTOR: Automatic distress button. It all adds up. May have been
199,running for months. High capacity power cell dependant for sunlight on
200,charging. 
201,SARAH: So we're still in the solar system. 
202,"DOCTOR: We're still in a solar system, but what particular star"
203,"provides the light and energy? Wherever we are, we're a long way out."
204,SARAH: I wonder what happened here? 
205,"DOCTOR: Hmm? Well, this is clearly the base for some kind of scientific"
206,"expedition, possibly geological. Something went wrong and they sent out"
207,a distress signal. 
208,SARAH: And died before help arrived. 
209,"DOCTOR: Yes, something like that. A lost expedition. "
210,"SARAH: So, what are we going to do? "
211,"DOCTOR: So, let's go back to the Tardis and fetch my spectromixer, and"
212,I'll fix our position by that star. Then I'll repair this power cell
213,and try and make contact. 
214,"SARAH: Well, you can get on with that now. I'll fetch the spectromixer."
215,
216,DOCTOR: Good idea. Would you do that? 
217,SARAH: Why not? I know the way. 
218,DOCTOR: Good thinking. What are you waiting for? 
219,SARAH: The key. 
220,DOCTOR: Oh. 
221,(The Doctor gives Sarah the Tardis key.) 
222,SARAH: Right. See you. 
223,(Sarah leaves. A mechanical whirring sound comes from the rear
224,compartment. The Doctor opens the door and enters. He finds Baldwin's
225,desiccated remains on the floor.) 
226,DOCTOR: Sarah. 
227, [Outside the Tardis] 
228, (Sarah has made it back to the Tardis. Something
229,parts a bush with invisible hands and watches her go inside. Then de
230,"Haan, Ponti, Vishinsky and two other men arrive.) "
231,VISHINSKY: Don't touch. Keep back. It may be a trap. Landing party to
232,probe. 
233,"(Inside the Tardis, Sarah is rummaging through a Gladstone bag.) "
234, [Space probe command area] 
235, SALAMAR: Understood. You've acted correctly. Do
236,not attempt entry. 
237,VISHINSKY : Shall we apply disintegrators? 
238,SALAMAR: On no account. It'll yield essential information on hostile
239,"forces. Your orders are, transpose object to probe. Out. Prepare the"
240,quarantine berth. 
241, [Outside the Tardis] 
242, (The landing party attach devices to the outside
243,"of the Tardis as someone watches from the bushes. Inside, Sarah finds"
244,"the device she needs and puts it in her jeans pocket, then goes to open"
245,the doors. They do not move. She tries again then goes over to pull at
246,them herself.) 
247,"VISHINSKY: All right, stand clear. "
248,(The Tardis vanishes.) 
249,VISHINSKY: Movement. Over there. Approach and identify yourself. 
250,(A man comes up to them.) 
251,VISHINSKY: Professor Sorenson! 
252,SORENSON: I've been observing you for some time. One has to be careful
253,on this planet. Appearances can be deceptive. 
254,"VISHINSKY: You all right, Professor? "
255,"SORENSON: Oh, yes. It's nearly dawn. The days are quite safe. "
256,VISHINSKY: But how are you? Galactic Mission Control received no word
257,from you. They sent us to investigate. 
258,SORENSON: I'm well. I'm more than well. My theory about Zeta Minor has
259,proved to be true. Only last night I made the vital discovery in Sector
260,five. 
261,VISHINSKY: Where are the others? 
262,SORENSON: Baldwin returned to the base last night. He was suffering
263,"from, from fatigue. He'll be fine now. Come, I'll show you the way. "
264,VISHINSKY: There were eight in your expedition. 
265,"SORENSON: Yes, we've had difficulties. Conditions are hard. We've lost"
266,"some, but the important thing is the mission has been a success. We"
267,found what we came to find. 
268,VISHINSKY: How many have you lost? 
269,SORENSON: He'll be fine now. It's just tiredness. He needs a good rest.
270,It's not far. 
271, [Base rear compartment] 
272, (The Doctor looks up to see a trio of weapons
273,pointed at him through the doorway. Sorenson pushes past and sees the
274,corpse on the floor.) 
275,SORENSON: Baldwin? 
276,DOCTOR: He's dead. 
277,SORENSON: Yes. Murdered. Just like the others. 
278,VISHINSKY: Stay where you are. 
279, [Quarantine berth] 
280, (Sarah tries the door controls again and this time
281,they open. She picks up the metal hand axe the Doctor had found and
282,goes outside. Salamar and a guard stand in an observation balcony
283,area.) 
284,SALAMAR: Stand just where you are. 
285,SARAH: Where am I? 
286,SALAMAR: You are in orbit around planet Zeta Minor. You're a Morestran
287,prisoner. 
288,SARAH: I can't breathe. 
289,SALAMAR: An oxygen type. Could be an Earthling. Transfer oxygen to
290,quarantine area. 
291,"MORELLI: Command deck calling you, Commander. "
292,"(Say hi to Michael Wisher, free from the Davros makeup.) "
293,SALAMAR: Right. Complete the quarantine procedures and bring the alien
294,to me. You see what she's holding? 
295, [Expedition base]
296,
297, (The hand axe is missing from a rack of tools on
298,the wall. Vishinsky is reporting in.) 
299,VISHINSKY: He calls himself the Doctor. He's not of our world. Claims
300,to have landed in response to a distress call. 
301, [Space probe command area] 
302, SALAMAR: Have you checked the transmitters down
303,there? 
304, [Expedition base]
305,
306," VISHINSKY: Yes, but any signal would have been"
307,monitored by our receivers. 
308,DOCTOR: Perhaps my receivers are better than yours. 
309,PONTI: Shut up! 
310,DOCTOR: My manners certainly are. 
311, [Space probe command area] 
312, SALAMAR: Can't Sorenson explain? 
313,VISHINSKY : He's too shocked. His mental state is strained. 
314,(Sarah is brought in.) 
315,SALAMAR: Understandable. We arrived just in time. And the prisoner? 
316,VISHINSKY : Just repeats the same story. 
317,SALAMAR: Keep a careful watch on him. I may have better fortune. 
318,"(Down on the planet, something roars and crackles through the jungle.) "
319,SALAMAR: You picked it up? 
320,SARAH: That's what I said. We picked up a distress call and landed
321,immediately. 
322,SALAMAR: Do you have any idea where Zeta Minor is situated? 
323,"SARAH: No, not exactly. "
324,SALAMAR: It's beyond Cygnus A. It's as distant again from Ortoro galaxy
325,as that galaxy is from the Anterades. It's on the very edge of the
326,known universe. You just happened to be passing when you received this
327,distress call? 
328,"SARAH: Well, no, no, no, we were on our way to London, to Earth. "
329,SALAMAR: To Earth? You said you came from Earth. 
330,"SARAH: Yes, we do. That is, I do. You see, the Doctor said we could, we"
331,could be back 
332,(The comm. beeps and Salamar answers it.) 
333,SALAMAR: Report. 
334,MORELLI : Landing site moving to obverse. Decision to land on
335,planet or continue in orbit imperative. 
336,"SALAMAR: We'll go in now, before night. I think you and your friend,"
337,"the Doctor, know much more about Zeta Minor than you want us to think."
338,Take her away. Commence landing procedure. 
339, [Expedition base]
340,
341," (Armed men leave the spacecraft, which has quietly"
342,"touched down next to the graveyard, and gather round the door to the"
343,Base. Salamar listens to Sorenson's story.) 
344,SORENSON: We'd only been working a few weeks when Lorenzo went. After
345,"that, Gura and then Summers. And then for a while, it stopped. We"
346,"thought that we were safe, that whatever it was had decided to leave us"
347,"in peace, but it wasn't to be. "
348,VISHINSKY: The killings always happened at night? 
349,"SORENSON: Oh, yes. The nights are the worst. "
350,SALAMAR: Naturally. Any force of alien infiltrators is going to operate
351,under cover of dark. A full and immediate confession would save you
352,great discomfort. 
353,DOCTOR: Discomfort? You mean you're going to torture me. 
354,"SALAMAR: Interrogate you. And nobody, Doctor, withstands Morestran"
355,interrogation for very long. Put him with the other prisoner. 
356,(The Doctor is taken away.) 
357,SALAMAR: We must try and contact the home planet again. 
358,"VISHINSKY: Not a chance, Controller. This far our, we're on our own. "
359,(Ponti and de Haan enter.) 
360,SALAMAR: Well? 
361,PONTI: We've searched a wide belt of the jungle in all directions. No
362,sign of any other life. 
363,SALAMAR: So that seems to narrow the killer down to our two aliens.
364,Prepare to execute them. 
365, [Base crew quarters] 
366," SARAH: Let's go, shall we? "
367,DOCTOR: How? 
368,SARAH: Through the window. 
369,DOCTOR: They're magnetically locked. 
370,SARAH: But the power is low. 
371,(The Doctor goes to the window and starts to push the pane downwards.) 
372, [Outside the  Expedition
373,base] 
374, (A sentry walks by as the crackling starts up. The
375,Doctor and Sarah appear from the side of the building to see a large
376,energy creature straight out of Forbidden Planet. They try to retreat
377,"but Sarah falls, and the entity looms over them.) "
378,
379, Part Two
380,
381, [Outside the  Expedition
382,base] 
383, (The sentry returns and fires at the energy
384,"creature, allowing the Doctor and Sarah to get away. The creature"
385,"smothers him, and he and his weapon fade away. Ponti and de Haan arrive"
386,as the creature leaves.) 
387,PONTI: Nothing. 
388,DE HAAN: I heard a scream. 
389,PONTI: Who's the guard on this sector? 
390,DE HAAN: O'Hara. There's no sign of him. 
391,PONTI: Let's get some lights round here. 
392,DE HAAN: Right. I'll go and look for him. 
393,"(Ponti and de Haan leave, then O'Hara's desiccated remains pop back"
394,into view.) 
395,"DOCTOR: All right, Sarah, I think it's gone. Are you all right? What's"
396,the matter? 
397,"SARAH: It's how I felt before, in the jungle. As though I was being"
398,drawn from my body. 
399,DOCTOR: You've had a very narrow escape. 
400,(They go over to O'Hara's body.) 
401,SARAH: What was it? 
402,"DOCTOR: I'm not sure yet, but I've got a very unpleasant theory."
403, [Expedition base]
404,
405, SALAMAR: Everything's normal now. 
406,VISHINSKY: Something caused that power drain. There was a temperature
407,drop of four degrees. 
408,PONTI: Controller! 
409,"VISHINSKY: Later, Ponti. We have a systems fault. "
410,"PONTI: I think the base is under attack, Controller. "
411,SALAMAR: Under attack? 
412,PONTI: We've heard something out there. And O'Hara seems to have
413,disappeared. We need lights. 
414,"SALAMAR: Better check the prisoners, Vishinsky. "
415, [Base crew quarters] 
416, SALAMAR: As I thought. 
417,VISHINSKY: I'll call the crew to alert. 
418, [Outside the  Expedition
419,base] 
420, SARAH: It's as if life was sucked out of him. 
421,(An alarm sounds.) 
422,DOCTOR: Come on. I think we've been missed. 
423, [Jungle] 
424, PONTI: Halt! 
425,"(The guards fire at the fleeing figures, and miss.) "
426, [Expedition base]
427,
428," VISHINSKY: With the power drain, the magnetic lock"
429,must have failed. 
430,SALAMAR: Obviously. But we still don't know what caused it. 
431,(Ponti enters.) 
432,SALAMAR: What is it? 
433,"PONTI: Something you should see for yourself, Controller. They've"
434,killed O'Hara. 
435, [Outside the  Expedition
436,base] 
437, SALAMAR: They must be recaptured and made to pay
438,for this. 
439,PONTI: We won't find them in this jungle. 
440,SALAMAR: They won't escape. We'll launch the oculoid tracker at first
441,light. 
442,"PONTI: Very good, Controller. "
443,SALAMAR: Get Sorenson. I want him to see this. 
444,VISHINSKY: He's under medicare in the probe. 
445,"SALAMAR: Bring him here immediately, Vishinsky. And I want a full"
446,bio-analysis on the cause of death. 
447,VISHINSKY: All right. 
448, [Jungle] 
449, SARAH: It's so dark. 
450,DOCTOR: Just hang on. 
451,SARAH: What's the matter? 
452,DOCTOR: Nothing. 
453,SARAH: Where are we going? 
454,DOCTOR: Shush. Listen. It's coming this way. 
455,(Lianas and seed pods sway as the crackling passes by.) 
456,SARAH: (sotto) That was lucky. 
457,"DOCTOR: Fortunately, time is on our side. "
458,SARAH: Time? 
459,DOCTOR: Yes. Night's candles are burned out and jocund day stands
460,tiptoe on the misty mountain top. Or something like that. 
461,(Close - it is burnt out. Romeo +
462,Juliet Act 3 Scene 5.) 
463,"SARAH: Ah, you mean it's getting light. "
464,DOCTOR: That's what Shakespeare meant. 
465,SARAH: Doesn't it like daylight? 
466,DOCTOR: That is the question. 
467,"SARAH: Oh, Doctor, where are you going? "
468, [Space probe command area] 
469," VISHINSKY: Projectile chamber three, ignition"
470,procedures activate. 
471,MORELLI : Projectile chamber three activated. Oculoid function
472,normal. 
473,(A flying disc containing a single eye with a vertical slit pupil
474,glides out of the spacecraft and looks around.) 
475,VISHINSKY: Launch attitude seven. 
476,MORELLI : Seven. 
477,VISHINSKY: Telesystems on transverse sweep. 
478,MORELLI : Transverse sweep established. 
479,(Salamar enters.) 
480,VISHINSKY: Maintain ocular frequency. 
481,MORELLI : Ocular frequency is transmitting now. 
482,VISHINSKY: Oculoid tracker launched. 
483,(A viewscreen shows an infrared image of the jungle.) 
484, [Jungle] 
485, (The Doctor and Sarah hear the tracker whirring as
486,"it bobs and weaves through the trees, and hide from it.) "
487,"SARAH: What was that, an elfin spirit of the forest? "
488,DOCTOR: Some sort of surveillance device. 
489,SARAH: Oh. At least we know we can't get lost. 
490,"DOCTOR: No. I met him once, you know. "
491,SARAH: Who? 
492,DOCTOR: Shakespeare. Charming fellow. Dreadful actor. 
493,SARAH: Perhaps that's why he took up writing. 
494,DOCTOR: Perhaps it was. 
495, [Space probe command area] 
496, SALAMAR: You've seen the body? 
497,SORENSON: All my party died the same way. A type of total dehydration. 
498,SALAMAR: I have the bio-analysis here. All the organs are undamaged. No
499,contusions or evidence of pressure. Complete extraction of bodily
500,fluids from tissue. 
501,VISHINSKY: We've no weapon in our technology that could produce such an
502,effect. 
503,"SALAMAR: No, a heat weapon would have produced external injuries. All"
504,the indications are that some very rapid form of freeze-drying
505,occurred. 
506,"SORENSON: Isn't this irrelevant, Controller? "
507,SALAMAR: Irrelevant? 
508,SORENSON: I came to Zeta Minor to prove a theory that could save our
509,civilisation. I've been successful. That's all that matters. 
510,SALAMAR: Seven men have died at the hands of these aliens. 
511,SORENSON: There is more at stake here than seven lives. Our solar
512,system is dependant upon a dying sun. I've discovered a new and
513,inexhaustible source of energy. Rock formations on the fringe of the
514,universe. 
515,"MORELLI: Controller, the oculoid tracker has located the prisoners. "
516,SALAMAR: Order out the pursuit party. 
517,"PONTI: Right, Controller. "
518,SORENSON: You're wasting time. My mineral samples must be loaded aboard
519,and we must prepare for immediate take off. 
520,SALAMAR: I am well aware of your high position in the science
521,"authorities, Professor, but this is a military expedition with military"
522,objectives. The manual says hostile alien forces must be searched out
523,and liquidated. That operation is now in hand. 
524, [Rock pool] 
525, (The Doctor and Sarah enter a rocky area with a
526,black pool in the middle. The Doctor throws a stone into it but there
527,"is no splash, no ripples.) "
528,"DOCTOR: Yes, this is it. "
529,SARAH: Is this where the thing lives? 
530,"DOCTOR: No, it doesn't live anywhere. It just is. "
531,SARAH: Uh oh. Doctor. 
532,(The oculoid tracker has found them.) 
533,DOCTOR: Never mind about that. Look down there. What do you see? 
534,SARAH: A pool. 
535,DOCTOR: Look into it. Wouldn't you expect to see a reflection? 
536,"SARAH: There's nothing. What do you mean, this is it? "
537,PONTI: Raise your hands over your heads. Search him. 
538,"DOCTOR: I can empty my own pockets, thank you. "
539,PONTI: Put your hands over your heads. 
540,"DOCTOR: I've nothing up my sleeve, if that's what you mean. "
541,PONTI: Search them both. 
542,(A guard grabs Sarah from behind. She struggles and Ponti goes to
543,search her. Suddenly he screams and falls backwards into the
544,nothingness hole.) 
545,DOCTOR: Get back! Didn't you learn anything? You're tampering with the
546,balance of nature on this planet in ways you don't understand. It may
547,already be too late. 
548, [Expedition base]
549,
550, SORENSON: I want these canisters loaded carefully.
551,
552,DE HAAN: What's in them? 
553,SORENSON: Refined ore. Energy. I calculate that six pounds of this
554,material in our own solar system would produce heat equivalent to the
555,"output of our own sun over a period of three centuries. Well, don't you"
556,"understand, man? Full scale exploitation of this planet would provide"
557,us with perpetual energy in any quantity whenever we needed it. I've
558,made the greatest discovery in scientific history. 
559,"DE HAAN: Do you need any of this other equipment, Professor? "
560,"SORENSON: You still don't understand the implications, do you. No, no,"
561,there's nothing here. The base can be abandoned. 
562, [Space probe command area] 
563, VISHINSKY: The prisoners have cleared quarantine. 
564,SALAMAR: Any weapons? 
565,"VISHINSKY: Our detectors revealed nothing. If they caused the deaths,"
566,they used some super-sensory process. 
567,SALAMAR: It's not unknown for aliens to utilise such techniques. Bring
568,them in. 
569,VISHINSKY: Have the aliens brought in. 
570,SALAMAR: Where's Sorenson? 
571,VISHINSKY: Getting his samples aboard preparatory to launching. 
572,SALAMAR: I've given no orders for a launching. There are seven deaths
573,to be accounted for. 
574,"VISHINSKY: Sorenson has a lot of authority in high circles, Salamar. It"
575,may be unwise to antagonise him. 
576,SALAMAR: He's still a civilian. Military priorities take precedence. 
577,VISHINSKY: Bring the prisoners forward. 
578,DOCTOR: Prisoners? We're here to help. We're not prisoners. 
579,"SALAMAR: You are prisoners, and you are charged with diverse acts of"
580,war against the subjects of Morestra. 
581,DOCTOR: Not guilty. 
582,SARAH: This is ridiculous. 
583,VISHINSKY: Silence. 
584,DOCTOR: Do you have any idea of what you're up against on this planet? 
585,SALAMAR: You will not respond to questions with counter-questions. 
586,DOCTOR: If you won't allow us 
587,"VISHINSKY: Silence! You will have a chance to speak, Doctor. "
588,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
589,SALAMAR: This interrogation will be conducted in an orderly manner.
590,Failure to comply will result in your immediate execution. 
591,(The Doctor opens his mouth but Sarah glares at him so he shuts it
592,again.) 
593, [Quarantine area] 
594, (de Haan places Sorenson's mineral containers next
595,to the Tardis.) 
596,MORELLI: Radioactive reading just within our tolerance. What do they
597,contain? 
598,SORENSON: Mineral elements from the planet. 
599, [Space probe command area] 
600," SALAMAR: Yesterday, you were found with the body"
601,of one of our scientists. Last night one of our guards died and you
602,were seen kneeling over him. Can you explain this? 
603,DOCTOR: We had nothing to do with those deaths. They were brought about
604,"by your intrusion. Listen, now listen to me, please. Here on Zeta Minor"
605,is the boundary between existence as you know it and the other
606,"universe, which you just don't understand. "
607,VISHINSKY: Other universe? 
608,"DOCTOR: Yes. From the beginning of time, it has existed side by side"
609,with the known universe. Each is the antithesis of the other. You call
610,"it nothing, a word to cover ignorance, then centuries ago scientists"
611,"invented another word for it. Antimatter, they called it. "
612,SALAMAR: Nonsense. Clever deception to cover their real motives. 
613,VISHINSKY: I don't think so. Let him finish. 
614,"DOCTOR: And you, by coming here, have crossed the boundary into that"
615,other universe to plunder it. Dangerous. 
616,SORENSON: Salamar. My mineral samples are aboard. It is getting dark.
617,Prepare for the return journey. 
618,"DOCTOR: Mineral samples? Sorenson, you can't take any part of this"
619,planet with you. 
620,SORENSON: That was the purpose of my expedition. 
621,DOCTOR: But you can't! 
622,SALAMAR: Get them out of here. I'll deal with them later. 
623,"DOCTOR: Sorenson, if you don't listen to me, you'll never leave this"
624,planet. 
625,(The Doctor and Sarah are dragged away.) 
626,"SALAMAR: Now look, Sorenson. I'm aware of your position, but I am in"
627,command of this probe and I decide when it takes off. Do you
628,understand? 
629,"SORENSON: What did he mean, we'll never leave this planet? "
630, [Quarantine area] 
631, SARAH: Do you ever get tired of being pushed
632,around? 
633,DOCTOR: Frequently. 
634,SARAH: We could get in the Tardis and disappear. 
635,(She pulls the key out of her pocket and the Doctor takes it.) 
636,"DOCTOR: No, no. It's tempting to let them go ahead and destroy"
637,"themselves. The trouble is, they wouldn't be the only ones. "
638,SARAH: How do you mean? 
639,DOCTOR: Cataclysm. 
640,SARAH: The Big Bang? 
641,DOCTOR: Yes. The end of the universe. 
642,(The Doctor opens one of Sorenson's canisters.) 
643,SARAH: What's that? 
644,DOCTOR: Do you remember the rocks around the pool? 
645,SARAH: Mmm. They were sort of a brownish colour. 
646,DOCTOR: This is a concentrated form. 
647,(The Doctor scoops some out with the lid of an empty tin of Farrah's
648,original Harrogate Toffees that he has in his pocket.) 
649,SARAH: It's changing colour! 
650,"(Gold, green, red, gold. The Doctor puts them in the tin and replaces"
651,the lid.) 
652,SARAH: What are you doing? What are you doing? 
653,DOCTOR: It's just an idea. 
654,(A noise starts up.) 
655,SARAH: It's the compression units. They're preparing to launch! 
656,DOCTOR: Fools. Do they really think they'll be allowed to leave with
657,this on board? 
658, [Space probe command area] 
659, (The last of the guards return to the ship and the
660,hatch closes.) 
661,VISHINSKY: Pressurisation complete. Cyclostimulators activate. 
662,MORELLI: Activated. 
663,VISHINSKY: Power jets to lock in positions. 
664,MORELLI: Locked. 
665,"VISHINSKY: Gyrostabilisers, activate. "
666,MORELLI: Activated. 
667,"VISHINSKY: Prepare for final ignition. Ten, nine, eight "
668,(The lights dim and an alarm sounds.) 
669,MORELLI: Pressurisation falling. Cyclostimulators not responding. 
670,SALAMAR: Activate secondary launch units. 
671,MORELLI: Cycle complete. 
672,VISHINSKY: Secondary launch units activated. 
673,SALAMAR: I don't understand. 
674,VISHINSKY: What's gone wrong? 
675,MORELLI: Emergency power units inoperative. Main and secondary circuits
676,failing. 
677,SALAMAR: Cancel ignition. 
678,VISHINSKY: It doesn't make sense. 
679,SORENSON: Look! 
680,(The energy creature is outside.) 
681,SALAMAR: What is it? 
682,VISHINSKY: It's going to attack the ship! 
683,SORENSON: Energy. Pure energy in physical form. It's incredible! 
684,VISHINSKY: Operate the forcefield barrier. 
685,SALAMAR: Get the alien prisoners up here. I think that thing's got
686,something to do with them. 
687,MORELLI: The barrier won't work. There's not enough power! 
688,SALAMAR: Get out there and stop it. 
689,(A squad of guards rush out as the Doctor and Sarah enter. The guard's
690,weapon's energy pulses go straight through the creature. It gets one of
691,them.) 
692,DOCTOR: You've sent those men to their deaths. Use the forcefield
693,barrier. 
694,VISHINSKY: It won't work. 
695,DOCTOR: Then link it to the atomic accelerator. 
696,MORELLI: It's too dangerous. 
697,(Another guard dies.) 
698,DOCTOR: Link the forcefield to the atomic accelerator! 
699,"VISHINSKY: We've got to try it, Salamar. Give the order! "
700,SALAMAR: Do it. 
701,MORELLI: Linked. 
702,VISHINSKY: Forcefield barrier. 
703,(The energy creature comes up against the forcefield and is pushed
704,back. It fades away.) 
705,"VISHINSKY: Thank you, Doctor. "
706,"SALAMAR: All right, tell us what you know about that. "
707,"DOCTOR: Sorenson, you're a scientist. Surely you appreciate the dangers"
708,of moving material from one dimension to another. 
709,SORENSON: That was the whole purpose of my expedition. 
710,DOCTOR: You're tampering with hideously dangerous forces. 
711,SALAMAR: But it's gone. 
712,"DOCTOR: Yes, for the moment. But while those mineral samples remain on"
713,"board, it'll always come back. "
714,VISHINSKY: Are you saying we can't take off? 
715,"DOCTOR: Unless you abandon those canisters, yes. "
716,SORENSON: But we need those mineral samples. 
717,DOCTOR: Why? 
718,"SORENSON: Our sun is dying. By taking material from this planet, we can"
719,refuel it and save our civilisation. 
720,DOCTOR: I'm afraid that isn't the solution. You must find an
721,alternative energy source. 
722,SALAMAR: So if we jettison those canisters we can take off? 
723,"DOCTOR: As long as your intention to leave as you came, empty-handed,"
724,is made clear. 
725,VISHINSKY: But how do we communicate that intention? 
726,"DOCTOR: Through me. I'm not entirely without influence, but it will"
727,take time. 
728,SALAMAR: Very well. But the girl will stay here. You may go. 
729,SORENSON: But 
730,DOCTOR: Alone. I must go alone. 
731,SARAH: Doctor. 
732,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know. I'll take care. "
733,(The Doctor leaves.) 
734,SALAMAR: Launch the oculoid tracker. I want his movements followed. 
735, [Rock pool] 
736, (The tracker watches as the Doctor stands at the
737,edge of the hole. Then the energy creature slowly rises from the
738,nothingness. The Doctor puts his hands to his head as the crackling
739,"starts, and he sways.) "
740,DOCTOR: No! 
741,(And everyone on the spacecraft watches in horror as he topples into
742,the hole.) 
743, Part Three
744,
745, [Space probe command area] 
746, SARAH: Doctor! Do something. 
747,SORENSON: There is nothing to be done. 
748,VISHINSKY: He has disappeared into the vortex between this universe and
749,the next. 
750,"SARAH: No, not the Doctor! He can't be dead. "
751,"SORENSON: He has ceased to exist. Controller, it is nearly night. We"
752,must prepare to launch. 
753,"SALAMAR: I agree. Vishinsky, see the Professor Sorenson's mineral"
754,samples are removed. 
755,"SORENSON: No. No, you can't leave those canisters behind. "
756,SALAMAR: Those minerals are endangering the safety of my command. They
757,must be jettisoned. 
758,SORENSON: You arrogant young fool. The whole purpose of your command
759,was to get me and that positron material back to our cosmos. 
760,"(Sarah sneaks out, unseen.) "
761,"SALAMAR: So that you can be hailed as the saviour of civilisation? No,"
762,Professor. My orders were simply to find your party and get back. 
763,"SORENSON: If you abandon that material, you destroy years of my life's"
764,work. 
765,SALAMAR: You are a civilian aboard a military vessel. There will be no
766,further argument. 
767,(Sarah makes her way through the jungle as the Doctor turns and falls
768,"through the nothingness of the void, until he comes face to face with"
769,the energy creature in its own reality. 
770, [Quarantine area] 
771," DE HAAN: Carry them in, carry them out. That ought"
772,to be the Space Service motto. 
773,"MORELLI: Yes, well, they've changed their minds. "
774,"DE HAAN: Yeah, well they could have changed their minds first, couldn't"
775,"they? I mean, just for a change. "
776,"MORELLI: Listen, de Haan. The Controller simply wants us to take these"
777,"canisters outside the take off forcefield area, right? "
778,DE HAAN: Right. 
779,MORELLI: Right. 
780,DE HAAN: It's only another fifty yards multiplied by ten. 
781, [Outside the quarantine area] 
782, (Sorenson hides under the stairs from the
783,quarantine area as Morelli and de Haan come out carrying canisters.) 
784,"DE HAAN: Half my service I spend flying one way, the other half I spend"
785,flying back again. They should pay me for staying in one place. 
786,(Morelli and de Haan come down the stairs and out.) 
787,MORELLI: Come on. 
788,(Sorenson goes up the stairs and into the quarantine area. He picks up
789,"one of the remaining canisters, gives the Tardis a funny look, and"
790,leaves.) 
791, [Rock pool] 
792, SARAH: Doctor! Doctor! Doctor. 
793,"(A hand appears over the edge of the 'pool', then a second. She grabs"
794,it and helps the Doctor pull himself out. He is clutching his toffee
795,tin.) 
796,"DOCTOR: Sarah, Vandervelt's equation of knowledge. Quite wrong. "
797,(The Doctor collapses.) 
798,"SARAH: Doctor, come on. Come on. The spaceship, it's leaving. Doctor!"
799,"Doctor! Doctor, wake up. Doctor! "
800, [Space probe command area] 
801," DE HAAN: All the canisters are off the ship,"
802,Controller. 
803,"SALAMAR: Good. We'll go for immediate take off, Vishinsky. "
804,VISHINSKY: Commence pressurisation and pre-ignition checks. 
805,REIG : Pre-ignition checks commenced. 
806,SALAMAR: Recall the oculoid. 
807,VISHINSKY: Cancel that! 
808,SALAMAR: What? 
809,VISHINSKY: The oculoid picture. Look! 
810,(The viewscreen shows Sarah struggling with the unconscious Doctor.) 
811,VISHINSKY: Cut the forcefield. 
812,"SALAMAR: Are you taking command, Vishinsky? "
813,"VISHINSKY: He's alive, Salamar. "
814,SALAMAR: There are higher priorities than recovering corpses. 
815,VISHINSKY: I'm going out for them. 
816,SALAMAR: We must leave this planet before night. Prepare the sick bay. 
817, [Sorenson's room] 
818, (Sorenson stares into the open canister as the
819,"crystals change colour - green, blue, green, blue, red, blue, red,"
820,white.) 
821,SORENSON: No. 
822,(He sits and picks up a dictaphone.) 
823,"SORENSON: While still on the surface of Zeta Minor, and within the"
824,"stable environment of the space probe, positron elements showed a"
825,"twenty, a twenty percent increase in flux activity. This would seem to"
826,"indicate a substantially greater, a greater, argh. "
827,(Sorenson puts his head in his hands in pain. The crystals glow red as
828,"he stands, goes over to a mirror and uncovers his eyes. They are"
829,"glowing red, like the crystals. He pours himself a glass of something"
830,"that steams in normal air, drinks it, then looks again. His eyes have"
831,returned to normal. 
832, [Sickbay] 
833," (The Doctor is carried in on a stretcher, which"
834,becomes part of the diagnostic bed. De Haan plugs it in and hands the
835,"cortical monitor to Vishinsky, who fits it to the Doctor's head.) "
836,VISHINSKY: Electro-function almost non-existent. 
837,SARAH: But he's still alive. 
838,VISHINSKY: Raise the stimulation intensity twelve degrees. 
839,DE HAAN: But that's way over safety margins. 
840,VISHINSKY: Do it! 
841,(The Doctor twitches.) 
842,SARAH: He moved! 
843,DE HAAN: Don't expect too much. 
844,SARAH: What? 
845,DE HAAN: They often move under stimulation. It's the nervous system. 
846,VISHINSKY: He's breathing. 
847,SARAH: He's coming round. Doctor. Doctor? 
848,SALAMAR : Stand by for take off. Vishinsky to command area. 
849,VISHINSKY: He'll be all right. Stay with him. 
850,SARAH: Vishinsky. Thanks for helping us. 
851,(Vishinsky and de Haan leave.) 
852, [Space probe command area] 
853," MORELLI: Pressurisation complete, Controller. "
854,SALAMAR: Activate cyclostimulators. 
855,(Vishinsky takes his seat.) 
856,MORELLI: Power jets locked in. 
857,"SALAMAR: Prepare for ignition. Take the countdown, Vishinsky. "
858,"VISHINSKY: If we don't make it this time, we never will. "
859, [Sickbay] 
860, (The Doctor wakes.) 
861,SARAH: Doctor. 
862,DOCTOR: What's the noise? 
863,SARAH: You're all right. We're taking off. 
864,DOCTOR: What? But the canisters. I promised. 
865,SARAH: It's all right. They've been dumped. Your promise as a Time
866,"Lord? Well, what happened? "
867,DOCTOR: It's difficult to explain. 
868,"SARAH: Well try. What did you do, enter another universe and have a"
869,chat with it? 
870,DOCTOR: I communicated. 
871,(The lights flicker and an alarm sounds.) 
872,SARAH: We seem to be having trouble again. 
873,(The Doctor takes his tin out of his pocket.) 
874,DOCTOR Oh! Come on. 
875, [Space probe command area] 
876, VISHINSKY: We're not going to make it. 
877,SALAMAR: Activate secondary boosters. 
878,REIG : Secondary boosters activated. 
879,VISHINSKY: The syncronisers are hitting red. 
880,MORELLI: Gravity drag increasing. 
881,SALAMAR: I want ten seconds of maximum fuel burn. 
882,VISHINSKY: That's crazy! You 
883,SALAMAR: You heard me. Ten seconds. 
884,(The Doctor and Sarah enter.) 
885,MORELLI: Gravity drag still increasing. Height only thirty miles. 
886,VISHINSKY: That's more than gravity. There's antimatter still aboard! 
887,SALAMAR: All the canisters were removed. 
888,DOCTOR: Except for this. 
889,SALAMAR: What's that? 
890,DOCTOR: Antimatter. How else do you think I survived that pool? 
891,SALAMAR: Is there enough there to hold us back? 
892,DOCTOR: Yes. 
893,"SALAMAR: You idiot. Morelli, get that to the jettison hatch fast. "
894,(Morelli grabs the tin and runs.) 
895, [Space probe corridor] 
896," (Morelli walks along, trance-like.) "
897,"DE HAAN: Hey, Morelli, when are we going to get some lights down here?"
898,Do you think the command area's the only place anyone's working? 
899,"(There is a crackling sound, then a strangled sound off screen.) "
900,DE HAAN: Morelli? Morelli! 
901,(De Haan runs down the corridor as Sorenson leaves Morelli's desiccated
902,body.) 
903,DE HAAN: Morelli. 
904, [Space probe command area] 
905," REIG: Height, two hundred miles. "
906,"VISHINSKY: We're in free space, but we're losing speed again. "
907,SALAMAR: Drag is still increasing. I don't understand it. 
908,DOCTOR: Then I suggest you search the ship. 
909,SALAMAR: Oh? Why? 
910,DOCTOR: Because there must still be antimatter aboard. It's the only
911,explanation. 
912,SALAMAR: Impossible. 
913,"VISHINSKY: Salamar, we're burning fuel at thirty units over norm. At"
914,this rate we'll never make the stellar systems. 
915,SARAH: But that means we'll be marooned in space! 
916,DOCTOR: If we're not vapourised first. 
917,SALAMAR: Vapourised? What do you mean? 
918,DOCTOR: Antimatter in collision with matter causes radiation
919,annihilation. A release of energy more powerful than nuclear fission. 
920,SALAMAR: There is no antimatter aboard this ship! 
921,DOCTOR: And I tell you there is. 
922,"DE HAAN: Controller! Controller, Morelli's dead. "
923,SALAMAR: Dead? 
924,DE HAAN: He's been killed by some sort of an animal. 
925,VISHINSKY: Animal? 
926,DE HAAN: I saw it in sector three. 
927,"VISHINSKY: Restore all walkway lights. All right, de Haan, come on."
928,Show us. 
929, [Sorenson's room] 
930, (Sorenson pours himself another 'cooling' drink.) 
931,SORENSON: It's all gone so wrong. 
932,(The intercom buzzes.) 
933,SORENSON: Yes? 
934,REIG : Report at once to sector three. Controller Salamar wants to
935,see you. 
936,SORENSON: What for? 
937, [Sickbay] 
938, (The desiccated corpse is being examined.) 
939,DOCTOR: Well? 
940,VISHINSKY: The pathology readout is identical to the others. Total
941,dehydration. Even the bone marrow. 
942,SARAH: But how could that thing get on board? 
943,VISHINSKY: I don't know. The forcefield was operating all the time the
944,hatch was open. It was phased to cut in automatically. 
945,(The corpse is slid into a mortuary cupboard.) 
946,DOCTOR: I wonder. 
947, [Space probe corridor] 
948, (The place where Morelli died is being scanned by
949,de Haan.) 
950,SALAMAR: You're a scientist. You must have formed some theory. 
951,SORENSON: All the deaths appear to have been caused by a technology
952,unknown to us. That would seem to implicate the Doctor and the girl. 
953,SALAMAR: Why? 
954,"SORENSON: Well, they're aliens. "
955,SALAMAR: But they were in the command area when Morelli was killed. 
956,SORENSON: That machine in the quarantine berth might contain the
957,answer. 
958, [Sickbay] 
959, (Vishinsky uses the intercom.) 
960,VISHINSKY: Crew records. What denomination was Morelli? 
961,DOCTOR: Can I see the printout? 
962,VISHINSKY: Of course. 
963,REIG : Morelli was Morestran Orthodox. 
964,"VISHINSKY: Oh, one of those. "
965,SARAH: What are you doing? 
966,VISHINSKY: Disposal procedure. We may have to play the last rites but
967,we don't have to listen. 
968,(He turns down the volume on the music. A hatch opens in the side of
969,the spacecraft and a casket floats out to rest amongst the stars.) 
970,VISHINSKY: Another good soldier gone to the greatest army of them all. 
971,SARAH: Out into space to drift forever. 
972,VISHINSKY: It's clean and tidy. 
973,SARAH: It's horrible. 
974,"DOCTOR: Vishinsky, I'd like a medical check on everybody aboard the"
975,ship. 
976,VISHINSKY: Why? 
977,DOCTOR: Because someone is contaminated. 
978,"SALAMAR: Yes, Doctor, and we want to examine that space machine of"
979,yours. 
980,DOCTOR: Why? 
981,SALAMAR: We believe you to be responsible for all the deaths. Unless
982,"you cooperate, I shall kill you and the girl without compunction. "
983,"SARAH: Oh, great. That's the thanks you get for helping people. "
984,DOCTOR: What is all this? 
985,VISHINSKY: The Doctor risked his life on our account. 
986,SALAMAR: That was a ruse to gain our confidence. His real intention is
987,to destroy us. 
988,DOCTOR: Why? For what reason? 
989,SORENSON: There are other civilisations as desperate as we are for new
990,energy sources. My discoveries on Zeta Minor would be of immense value
991,to them. 
992,"DOCTOR: Professor Sorenson, has it ever occurred to you that you might"
993,be mistaken? That there is no practical method of exploiting antiquark
994,energy? 
995,"SORENSON: Oh no, you're wrong. I've spent my life discovering"
996,alternative energy. 
997,REIG : Controller Salamar. Calling the Controller. 
998,"SALAMAR: What is it, Reig? "
999,"REIG : We're in trouble, sir. The ship's stopped moving. "
1000,SALAMAR: That's impossible. 
1001, [Space probe command area] 
1002," REIG: Sir, the progress register has stopped."
1003,We're making no headway. 
1004, [Sickbay] 
1005," SALAMAR: I'm coming up. Professor, watch the girl."
1006,"You, come with us. "
1007,(The space service men leave with the Doctor.) 
1008,"SARAH: There's no need to. I'm not going to jump out, am I. "
1009,SORENSON: What is your friend's field of science? 
1010,"SARAH: Oh, everything. He's brilliant. "
1011,SORENSON: And he's wrong. He has to be wrong. Antiquarks come in three
1012,"configurations, exactly as I predicted. All my theoretical calculations"
1013,have proved this! We shall find a way of discovering the energy! 
1014,SARAH: All right. I'm not arguing. 
1015, [Space probe command area] 
1016, VISHINSKY: We're stationary. Suspended in space. 
1017,SALAMAR: It's crazy. The thrusters are still at full power. 
1018,DOCTOR: The answer's really very simple. You've come to the end of your
1019,piece of elastic. 
1020,SALAMAR: What are you talking about? 
1021,"DOCTOR: It won't stretch any further. In fact, very soon it will start"
1022,to pull you back. 
1023,SALAMAR: Nothing can do that. 
1024,DOCTOR: Antimatter can. There's still some aboard and this proves it. 
1025,VISHINSKY: You mean the ship will be dragged back to Zeta Minor? 
1026,"DOCTOR: Yes, faster and faster. Until, of course, we reach the surface,"
1027,then we'll stop with a bang. The only way to prevent it is to find the
1028,antimatter. 
1029,SALAMAR: You're diverting attention from what's really causing the
1030,trouble. You! You and whatever's in that machine of yours. Something
1031,that's draining the power from this ship. 
1032,"DOCTOR: Salamar, you're wrong again. "
1033,"SALAMAR: We'll see. Vishinsky, take charge here. "
1034, [Sickbay] 
1035, SORENSON: Antimatter is simply matter composed
1036,"entirely of antiparticles. Therefore, the hypothetical energy"
1037,"available, available, is, is stupendous. "
1038,(Sorenson clutches his head.) 
1039,SARAH: What's wrong? Are you all right? 
1040,"SORENSON: Yes. Yes, I'm "
1041,(The crackling starts up and Sarah goes rigid. Sorenson staggers out of
1042,the room and she returns to normal.) 
1043, [Space probe corridor] 
1044, (De Haan is still scanning the floor plates when
1045,"Sorenson walks past him. He goes up the stairs, then turns and comes"
1046,back down again.) 
1047,"DE HAAN: Oh, Professor, I "
1048,(De Haan looks horrified. Sarah hears his scream in Sickbay and runs
1049,out.) 
1050,DE HAAN: Argh! 
1051, [Quarantine area] 
1052," (The Doctor enters with his hands raised, followed"
1053,by Salamar brandishing a hand weapon.) 
1054,DOCTOR: Usually I only entertain friends in the Tardis. 
1055,SALAMAR: Shut up. Open it. 
1056,"DOCTOR: Externally, as you can see, it resembles a London police box. "
1057,SALAMAR: Open it! 
1058,"(Sarah screams somewhere. Salamar turns, the Doctor grabs his gun arm"
1059,"and knocks him out with a punch, then leaves.) "
1060, [Space probe corridor] 
1061, (Sarah is watching the shadow of Sorenson's Hyde
1062,persona snarling over de Haan's body.) 
1063,DOCTOR : Sarah! 
1064,"(The shadow leaves, and Sarah goes forward to find the desiccated"
1065,remains on the floor.) 
1066,"DOCTOR: Sarah, what happened? "
1067,SARAH: I caught a glimpse of that thing. It was horrible. 
1068,DOCTOR: Antiman. 
1069,SARAH: Antiman? 
1070,DOCTOR: A hybrid creature running amok. 
1071,SALAMAR: Don't move! De Haan. You've killed de Haan! 
1072,"DOCTOR: Oh, now listen, Sa "
1073,(Salamar shoots the Doctor point blank.) 
1074,SARAH: Doctor! 
1075,(Vishinsky enters and tries to take Salamar's weapon.) 
1076,SALAMAR: No! They killed de Haan. 
1077,VISHINSKY: Some thing killed de Haan. 
1078,SALAMAR: Let's get rid of them before they kill us all. Take them to
1079,the ejector chamber. Hurry! 
1080,"(Guards drag the Doctor away, and Sarah follows at gunpoint. "
1081,"In his room, Sorenson takes another drink, but then knocks over the"
1082,flask. Viscous red liquid pours out onto the floor. To a faint
1083,"crackling sound, and with his eyes still glowing red, Sorenson crawls"
1084,onto his bed.) 
1085, [Sickbay] 
1086, (A hatch opens in the side of the ship. The Doctor
1087,and Sarah are strapped into two mortuary units.) 
1088,SALAMAR: Prepare to eject. 
1089,SARAH: You can't do this! It's murder! 
1090,VISHINSKY: She's right. You have no evidence. You cannot do it. 
1091,SALAMAR: How much evidence do you want? The whole crew dead? Eject!
1092,Eject. 
1093,"VISHINSKY: No, Salamar. "
1094,(The two men struggle. Salamar forces Vishinsky's arm down onto the
1095,"handle that sets the process in motion, and the Doctor and Sarah slide"
1096,out of sight.) 
1097, Part Four
1098,
1099, [Space probe command area] 
1100, REIG: Maintain boosters at full thrust. We're only
1101,just holding rev. We must avoid being pulled into reverse. 
1102,(There is a crackling noise behind him. Reig turns and then calls into
1103,the intercom.) 
1104,REIG: This is the command deck! Send help! Argh! 
1105, [Sickbay] 
1106, REIG : Help! Argh! 
1107,"(Salamar and Vishinsky stop fighting. Salamar leaves with the guards,"
1108,and Vishinsky reverses the eject controls before following them. The
1109,Doctor and Sarah slide back into view.) 
1110, [Space probe command area] 
1111, SALAMAR: Reig! 
1112,(A desiccated corpse lies over Reig's console.) 
1113,VISHINSKY: Reig. If we hadn't been wasting our time down there. 
1114,SALAMAR: They caused it all. 
1115,VISHINSKY: How could they have caused this? We were with them. (into
1116,intercom) Attention. All crewmen report to assembly point immediately.
1117,Red alert! Red alert! 
1118,SALAMAR: Countermanded. Only I can give a red alert. 
1119,"VISHINSKY: It's too late for any more mistakes, Salamar. I'm taking"
1120,command. 
1121,SALAMAR: You'll regret this. 
1122, [Sickbay] 
1123, (Sarah and the Doctor have freed themselves and
1124,are climbing out of the mortuary trays. The Doctor is still groggy.) 
1125,DOCTOR: Where've they gone? 
1126,SARAH: I think there's been another killing. 
1127,DOCTOR: What? 
1128,"SARAH: Doctor. Doctor, it is that thing from the planet. I felt it. "
1129,DOCTOR: You what? 
1130,"SARAH: Just before de Haan was killed, I felt the same sort of icy"
1131,suction. 
1132,DOCTOR: Who was with you? 
1133,SARAH: Professor Sorenson. 
1134,DOCTOR: Sorenson. Of course. The sole survivor of the expedition. 
1135,SARAH: So Sorenson is Antiman. 
1136,DOCTOR: Yes. He's been infected with antimatter. His brain cells are
1137,being destroyed. He'll descend to the level of a brute. Sarah? 
1138,SARAH: Yes? 
1139,DOCTOR: Get to command deck. Tell them to shut down all the hatches.
1140,Our only chance is to keep it isolated. 
1141,SARAH: Right. But what are you going to do? Doctor! 
1142,DOCTOR: Do as I say. 
1143, [Space probe command area] 
1144, VISHINSKY: Command area to solarium section. Who's
1145,in charge there? 
1146,"RANJIT : Senior crewleader Ranjit, sir. "
1147,VISHINSKY: Ranjit? Good. You know why we're on red alert? 
1148,RANJIT : They say we picked up some contagion back on the planet. 
1149,"VISHINSKY: We picked up something. Some animal. It's killed Morelli,"
1150,"Reig and de Haan, so take no chances. Keep your men on full alert and"
1151,await further orders. 
1152,"RANJIT : Right, sir. "
1153,"SALAMAR: What are you going to do now, Vishinsky? Look at the course"
1154,"monitor. We're heading back to Zeta Minor. Come on, you've taken"
1155,"charge. Give an order. Give an order that'll stop us crashing, or we're"
1156,all going to die. 
1157,"VISHINSKY: Keep your nerve, Salamar. "
1158,(Sarah enters.) 
1159,VISHINSKY: Where's the Doctor? 
1160,"SARAH: I don't know, but he said you've got to close all the hatchways"
1161,immediately. 
1162,VISHINSKY: As soon as Professor Sorenson reports in. 
1163,"SARAH: No, now! Don't wait for Sorenson. The Doctor says he's behind"
1164,all this. 
1165,SALAMAR: That's insane. How can he be? 
1166,"SARAH: Something on the planet affected him. Look, you've got to shut"
1167,the hatchways before it's too late. 
1168,SALAMAR: It's another trick. 
1169,VISHINSKY: The Doctor's been right so far. We should have listened to
1170,him before. Close all section hatchways! 
1171,"(Bulkheads come down in the corridors, sealing them into small"
1172,compartments.) 
1173, [Sorenson's room] 
1174, (The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver to unlock
1175,"the door, and enters carefully. He opens the container on the desk then"
1176,puts the lid on it again. He is about to leave when he notices the
1177,"flask by the mirror. After picking it up and sniffing it, the Doctor"
1178,"opens the container again and spoons out some pulverised crystal, then"
1179,pours a few drops of the red liquid onto it. The crystals glow brightly
1180,for a few moments then turn a dull brown. The Doctor reseals the
1181,container as Sorenson enters behind him.) 
1182,DOCTOR: Keep away! 
1183, [Space probe command area] 
1184, SARAH: And the antimatter has turned Sorenson into
1185,that monster. 
1186,VISHINSKY: It's incredible. Sorenson? 
1187,(Salamar runs up the steps and takes a unit from a conduit running up
1188,the wall.) 
1189,VISHINSKY: Salamar! 
1190,(Salamar pulls his weapon out.) 
1191,SALAMAR: Keep away! 
1192,VISHINSKY: Don't be a fool. 
1193, [Sorenson's room] 
1194, (The Doctor brandishes the container like a
1195,weapon.) 
1196,DOCTOR: Keep away. 
1197,SORENSON: I require an explanation. 
1198,"DOCTOR: Professor Sorenson, you're ill. "
1199,"SORENSON: What do you mean, ill? "
1200,DOCTOR: You think you've discovered an oral vaccine to protect you
1201,"against antiquark penetration, but you're wrong. "
1202,SORENSON: It worked. 
1203,"DOCTOR: For a time, but it set up a cycle of chemical change. There's"
1204,"no way back, Sorenson. You've reached the point where your tissues are"
1205,so monstrously hybridised that the next metabolic change could be the
1206,final one. 
1207,SORENSON: No. 
1208,DOCTOR: There isn't much time. 
1209,SORENSON: No! 
1210,"DOCTOR: You and I are scientists, Professor. We buy our privilege to"
1211,experiment at the cost of total responsibility. 
1212,(The Doctor hands Sorenson the container.) 
1213,SORENSON: The hypothesis was false. 
1214,(Sorenson leaves.) 
1215, [Space probe command area] 
1216, SALAMAR: Open the hatch! 
1217,"VISHINSKY: Take the shielding off that neutron accelerator, you'll be"
1218,dead in minutes. 
1219,"SALAMAR: But I'll take Sorenson with me. You'd like that, wouldn't you,"
1220,Vishinsky? That might save your life. You'd like to live? 
1221,VISHINSKY: You're out of your mind. 
1222,"SALAMAR: Oh, no. No, this is leadership. Strong action. That's why I'm"
1223,Controller. Open that hatch! 
1224,(A guard moves forward and Salamar shoots him.) 
1225,"SALAMAR: Now, open it! "
1226,"SARAH: Let him go, Vishinsky. Let him go! "
1227,(Vishinsky goes to Reig's console and presses a button.) 
1228,"SALAMAR: You, Controller? You haven't a hope. "
1229,(Salamar leaves.) 
1230,"VISHINSKY: If Sorenson doesn't get him, the radiation will. "
1231, [Sickbay] 
1232, (Sorenson staggers in and puts the container in a
1233,mortuary tray. Then he lies down in the other and reaches for the eject
1234,"handle. But the hand is no longer human, and it does not push it down."
1235,"Meanwhile, Salamar heads for the quarantine area. A little later, the"
1236,Doctor enters the sickbay and sees the container. The intercom beeps.) 
1237,VISHINSKY [OC}: Command area calling. 
1238, [Space probe command area] 
1239, DOCTOR : This is the Doctor. 
1240,"VISHINSKY: Doctor, we're accelerating back to Zeta Minor. Have you"
1241,located the antimatter? 
1242, [Sickbay] 
1243," DOCTOR: Listen, Vishinsky. Listen. There are now"
1244,"two forces of antimatter aboard. I've got one, and the other one is"
1245,Sorenson himself. 
1246, [Space probe command area] 
1247, SARAH: But Salamar's out hunting Sorenson now. 
1248,VISHINSKY: With a neutron accelerator. 
1249, [Sickbay] 
1250, DOCTOR: He's got to be stopped. How long to
1251,impact? 
1252,VISHINSKY : Less than thirty minutes. 
1253,DOCTOR: Keep the hatchways open. 
1254,(The Doctor leaves with the container.) 
1255, [Quarantine area] 
1256, (Something crackles and croaks in the room.) 
1257,SALAMAR: Come on! Come on out and face me! 
1258,DOCTOR : Salamar! 
1259, [Space probe corridor] 
1260," DOCTOR: Where are you, Salamar? Don't use the"
1261,accelerator. Salamar! 
1262, [Quarantine area] 
1263, DOCTOR : Where are you? Salamar! Whatever you
1264,"do, don't use the accelerator! "
1265,(But Salamar opens the shielding on the unit as the devolved Sorenson
1266,attacks him.) 
1267,DOCTOR : Salamar! 
1268,"(Sorenson knocks Salamar down, and gets the full glow of the neutron"
1269,"accelerator. By the time the Doctor enters, Salamar has been"
1270,"desiccated. The Doctor closes the shielding, takes Salamar's weapon,"
1271,"the accelerator and the canister, and goes to the intercom.) "
1272,VISHINSKY : Command area. 
1273,"DOCTOR: Vishinsky, it's too late. Salamar's dead. "
1274, [Space probe command area] 
1275, DOCTOR : He used the neutron accelerator. If
1276,"he hit Sorenson, it could be disastrous. "
1277,SARAH: You mean things can get worse? I don't believe it. 
1278,DOCTOR : Keep the hatches open. I'm coming up. 
1279,"(Out in the corridor, the Doctor is confronted by two energy creatures."
1280,"He waves the canister at them and they back away, then try to confront"
1281,him again further along.) 
1282,"SARAH: Oh, why is he taking so long? "
1283,"VISHINSKY: I'll try the quarantine area again. Doctor. Doctor, if you"
1284,"can hear me, indicate your position. "
1285,"SARAH: Something's happened to him. Doctor, are you all right? "
1286,(Someone or something bangs on the door on the upper level.) 
1287,"DOCTOR : Open up, Vishinsky. Open up! "
1288,(The Doctor enters.) 
1289,DOCTOR: Shut down all the hatchways. It may hold them. 
1290,SARAH: Them? 
1291,"DOCTOR: Yes, them. They've multiplied. "
1292,(Vishinsky puts the neutron accelerator back where it belongs.
1293,"Meanwhile, an Antiman walks through a bulkhead. They watch the progress"
1294,on a diagram of the probe on the monitor.) 
1295,"SARAH: Doctor, look. The hatchways are going. "
1296,VISHINSKY: What are they? 
1297,DOCTOR: Duplicates of Sorenson. Pure antimatter. The neutron
1298,"accelerator boosted its power, and the creatures split off and"
1299,multiplied. 
1300,"VISHINSKY: They're going towards the solarium chamber. Ranjit, what's"
1301,happening? Can you hear me? 
1302,RANJIT : They're attacking. We need help! They're coming through!
1303,Argh! 
1304,VISHINSKY: Seven men. Sixteen minutes to impact. 
1305,SARAH: How can we stop them? 
1306,VISHINSKY: Acceleration thirty STS. Fifteen minutes. 
1307,"SARAH: Doctor, what are we going to do? "
1308,"DOCTOR: Stay here with Vishinsky, Sarah. I'm going out now and I may be"
1309,some time. 
1310,VISHINSKY: Acceleration fifty STS. Fourteen minutes. 
1311, [Quarantine area] 
1312," (Using the antimatter container as a shield, the"
1313,Doctor returns.) 
1314,DOCTOR: Sorenson? Sorenson. 
1315,(He wards off three antimatter creatures then Sorenson himself comes
1316,"from behind the Tardis, looking very Mister Hyde. The Doctor uses"
1317,"Salamar's weapon to knock him down, unlock the Tardis and drag him"
1318,inside. The Tardis dematerialises. The Doctor secures Sorenson's hands
1319,and feet in a rigid shackle before he wakes.) 
1320, [Space probe command area] 
1321, VISHINSKY: Acceleration seventy three STS. Eight
1322,minutes. 
1323,(Four Antimen are still walking through bulkheads. Vishinsky returns
1324,from looking outside the area.) 
1325,"VISHINSKY: They're all around us. Come on, I'll need your help. "
1326,SARAH: We've only six minutes. Where are we going? 
1327,VISHINSKY: To get the forcefield equipment. If we can lay a band around
1328,the command area we may be able to keep them out. 
1329,"(In the Tardis, Sorenson starts to bend the shackles like plasticine.) "
1330, [Forcefield equipment cupboard]
1331,
1332, VISHINSKY: Take that. I'll bring the control box. 
1333,(Two Antimen appear.) 
1334,"VISHINSKY: Back, quickly! "
1335, [Space probe command area] 
1336, VISHINSKY: Direction them in a line straight
1337,across. We'll seal off the area. 
1338,(They lay out the projectors. Smoke starts to come from the upper level
1339,hatch.) 
1340,SARAH: Look! 
1341,"(An Antiman comes through. In the Tardis, Sorenson has freed himself"
1342,and comes after the Doctor. The Doctor has landed the Tardis by the
1343,"rock pool on Zeta Minor, and lures Sorenson out. They struggle by the"
1344,hole. Now two Antimen have entered the command area and are coming down
1345,"the steps towards the forcefield projectors. On the planet, Sorenson is"
1346,finally toppled into the hole. The Doctor throws the canister of
1347,antimatter in after him. The Antimen vanish.) 
1348,"VISHINSKY: Thirty seconds. Look, we're slowing down. Twenty five"
1349,seconds. We've stopped. We're still on full power. 
1350,SARAH: We're moving again. 
1351,VISHINSKY: We're gaining height! We're moving away from the surface!
1352,The Doctor has done it! 
1353,"SARAH: Yes, but where is he? "
1354, [Rock pool] 
1355, (A normal human being is lying beside the hole.) 
1356,DOCTOR: Sorenson. Professor Sorenson. 
1357,(He helps the dazed man into the Tardis and it dematerialises as the
1358,big energy creature emerges from the hole.) 
1359, [Tardis] 
1360, SORENSON: Where am I? What am I doing here? 
1361,"DOCTOR: You're a very lucky man, Professor. You've been released. "
1362,SORENSON: Released? 
1363,DOCTOR: Yes. Because I kept my promise and returned the antimatter. 
1364,SORENSON: This isn't the Morestran probe ship. 
1365,"DOCTOR: Don't you worry, Professor. Just rest a while. Everything's"
1366,going to be all right.) 
1367,(The Tardis materialises back in the quarantine area.)

1369, VISHINSKY: We're making good progress now. Once we

1371,SARAH: Doctor! 
1372,VISHINSKY: Professor Sorenson! Are you all right? 
1373,"SORENSON: Yes. Yes, I remember now. My researches. I've discovered a"
1374,new source of energy. 
1375,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, Professor. I think you'd abandoned that line. You'd"
1376,decided to concentrate on deriving energy from the kinetic force of
1377,planetary movement. 
1378,SORENSON: Had I? 
1379,DOCTOR: Yes. Large source of untapped energy there. 
1380,SORENSON: The kinetic force of planetary movement. What a brilliant
1381,idea! 
1382,"SARAH: Goodbye, Vishinsky. And thank you. "
1383,(Sarah hugs Vishinsky. 
1384,"VISHINSKY: Goodbye. Goodbye, Doctor. "
