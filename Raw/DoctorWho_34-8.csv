19, (Images
20,"of the number 66, an incandescent light bulb fickers, then a"
21,traditional horror film mummy is roaring and reaching for us -)
22,DOCTOR : Start the clock.
23,
24,
25,[Restaurant coach]
26,
27,(The numbers count down near the bottom of the screen. A young
28,woman in traditional black and white maids uniform walks down the
29,"central aisle of a steam train's restaurant coach. It is the 1920s, and"
30,the whistle
31,"blows. At 52 seconds, an old woman looks up, then lowers her lorgnette"
32,and
33,speaks to the fashionable young lady opposite.)
34,MRS PITT: Is there some sort of fancy dress thing on this evening?
35,
36,MAISIE: I don't think so. Why do you ask?
37,
38,"MRS PITT: Well, that fellow over there, dressed as a mummy monster"
39,thing.
40,
41,MAISIE: Who do you mean? I can't see him.
42,
43,(The mummy reaches for Mrs Pitt. She summons the head waiter.)
44,MRS PITT: You! You! Throw that man out of my dining car. It's
45,disgusting.
46,
47,"WAITER: I'm sorry, Madam. Which man?"
48,
49,"MRS PITT: Which man?! I'll have your job. That man, right there,"
50,dressed as a monster.
51,
52,(The head waiter walks away.)
53,"MAISIE: Mama, there isn't anyone there. Are you feeling okay?"
54,
55,"MRS PITT: Don't you dare lie to me, girl. I won't be made a fool of."
56,Stop it. Stop it. Stop him at once. Right now.
57,
58,"MAISIE: Mama, there's no one there. You're worrying me. Do you want one"
59,of your pills?
60,
61,"MRS PITT: Oh, no! Get it off! Get it off!"
62,
63,(Zero. The mummy puts its hands Mrs Pitt's head and she goes limp.
64,Maisie stands up.)
65,"MAISIE: Oh! Is there a doctor? Sorry, I need a doctor. Sorry, I don't"
66,"know. She just, she just stopped."
67,
68,(A man comes over to check on Mrs Pitt as the steam whistle blows. The
69,camera moves back through the window to show us the name of
70,the train - Orient Express - as it hurtles on through space.) 
71,
72,[Baggage car]
73,
74,(The
75,"Tardis materialises in a space at the back of the car, amidst racks of"
76,"suitcases, and the Doctor steps out"
77,wearing a black suit with a white handkerchief in the breast pocket and
78,"a loose bow tie with very long ends, sort of Western style. He"
79,"holds out his hand to his companion, a fashionable flapper with"
80,jaw-length bobbed hair.)
81,"DOCTOR: Your train awaits, my lady."
82,
83,CLARA: Wonderful.
84,
85,DOCTOR: The baggage car. But thanks for lying. The real wonderful is
86,through here.
87,
88,(The train's bell rings. Music is coming from nearby.)
89,"DOCTOR: There were many trains to take the name Orient Express, but"
90,only one in space.
91,
92,[Lounge]
93,
94,"(Comfortable chairs down the side of the carriage, a"
95,"bar at one end, and armed men standing guard. The band is playing a"
96,slow jazz version of Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. The singer is
97,"a young lady called Foxes, so that's what I'll call her instead of just"
98,Singer.)
99,CLARA: Of course it is. 
100,FOXES: (sings) So don't stop me now.
101,DOCTOR: Completely faithful recreation of the original Orient
102,"Express. Except slightly bigger. And in space. Oh, and the rails are"
103,"actually hyperspace ribbons. But in every other respect, identical."
104,Painstaking attention to detail.
105,
106,"(A man with a bald head, big red beard and steampunk eyepatch barges in"
107,between them.)
108,FOXES: (sings) I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars 
109,DOCTOR: Most of the time.
110,
111,(The Doctor rubs his bruised arm.)
112,"FOXES: (sings) On a collision course I am a satellite, I'm out of"
113,control. I'm a sex machine ready to reload. Like an atom bomb about
114,"to oh, oh, oh "
115,DOCTOR: You're doing it again.
116,
117,CLARA: Doing what?
118,
119,DOCTOR: The smile.
120,
121,"CLARA: Yeah, I'm smiling."
122,
123,DOCTOR: It's the sad smile. It's a smile but you're sad. It's
124,confusing. It's like two emotions at once. It's like you're
125,malfunctioning.
126,
127,CLARA: Sorry.
128,
129,FOXES: (sings) Travelling at the speed of light. Wanna make a
130,supersonic woman of you.
131,DOCTOR: I just thought this would be a good one to 
132,CLARA: To end it. Yeah. It is. It's a good choice. A good one to end
133,on.
134,
135,DOCTOR: Yeah?
136,
137,CLARA: Mmm hmm.
138,
139,DOCTOR: Shall we?
140,
141,(The maid approaches with a tray of champagne flutes. The Doctor offers
142,Clara his arm.)
143,"CLARA: Mmm hmm,."
144,
145,FOXES: (sings) Gimme a call. Don't stop me now Don't stop me. 
146,(An indicator changes from a monocle to a thumbs up with a ting! The
147,onboard computer speaks.) 
148,GUS: Ladies and gentlemen. If you would be good enough to look from
149,"the windows on the right of the train, you'll be able to see the"
150,soaring majesty of the Magellan black hole.
151,
152,"DOCTOR: Oh, I remember when this was all planets as far as the eye"
153,could see. All gone now. Gobbled up by that beast. And there's that
154,smile again. I don't even know how you do that.
155,"CLARA: I really thought I hated you, you know?"
156,
157,"DOCTOR: Well, thank God you kept that to yourself. There was this"
158,"planet, Obsidian. The planet of perpetual darkness."
159,
160,"CLARA: I did. I did hate you. In fact, I hated you for weeks."
161,
162,"DOCTOR: Good, fine. Well, I'm glad that we cleared that up. There was"
163,also a planet that was made completely of shrubs.
164,
165,CLARA: I went to a concert once. Can't remember who it was. But do you
166,know what the singer said?
167,
168,"DOCTOR: Frankly, that would be an absolutely astonishing guess if I did"
169,know.
170,
171,"CLARA: She said, ""hatred is too strong an emotion to waste on someone"
172,"that you don't like."" "
173,"(I thought that was a Sixto Rodriguez quote, but don't mind me.)"
174,DOCTOR: Were people really confused? Cos I'm confused. Did everybody
175,leave?
176,
177,"CLARA: Shush. Shut up. Look, what I'm trying to say is, I"
178,don't hate you. I could never hate you. But I can't do this any
179,more. Not the way you do it.
180,
181,DOCTOR: Can I talk about the planets now?
182,
183,CLARA: Yes. Go.
184,
185,DOCTOR: Thedion Four. Constant acid rain. Had a lovely picnic there
186,"once, wearing a gas mask."
187,
188,MAISIE: That's a lie.
189,
190,CLARA: I'm sorry?
191,
192,"MAISIE: That's a lie, what you said. Thedion Four was destroyed"
193,"thousands of years ago, so you couldn't have been there."
194,
195,"(The chief train guard comes over. He wears a uniform with two medals,"
196,lots of gold frogging and has a gun in a holster.)
197,"QUELL: Miss Pitt, are you sure you wouldn't rather rest in your room?"
198,
199,MAISIE: That man's a liar.
200,
201,QUELL: Perhaps you'd allow Mister Carlyle here to escort you back.
202,
203,(Another uniformed guard.)
204,"CARLYLE: It'll be all right, miss. Just come with me."
205,
206,QUELL: Sorry about that. I suppose it's understandable in the
207,circumstances. I don't believe we've been introduced. Captain Quell.
208,
209,CLARA: I'm Clara. This is the Doctor.
210,
211,"QUELL: Ah, another one."
212,
213,CLARA: Sorry? Another what?
214,
215,"QUELL: Well, we've got doctors and professors coming out of our ears on"
216,"this trip. So, what are you a doctor of?"
217,
218,"DOCTOR: Now, there's a question that's never asked often enough. Let's"
219,say intestinal parasites.
220,
221,QUELL: I'm beginning to think Miss Pitt was right about you.
222,
223,CLARA: What's wrong with her? Did something happen?
224,
225,QUELL: You mean you really don't know?
226,
227,
228,[Corridor]
229,
230,(They take their champagne out into the corridor to talk.)
231,"CLARA: There's a body and there's a mummy. I mean,"
232,can you not just
233,get on a train? Did a wizard put a curse on you about mini-breaks?
234,
235,DOCTOR: It might be nothing. Old ladies die all the time. It's
236,practically
237,their job description.
238,
239,CLARA: And the monster?
240,
241,"DOCTOR: Well, seen by no one except her, which suggests that it"
242,"wasn't there. A dying brain, lack of oxygen, hallucinations. Anyway,"
243,people do just die sometimes. She was over a hundred years old.
244,
245,CLARA: Says the two thousand year old man.
246,
247,"DOCTOR: Clara, you actually sound as if you want this to be a"
248,thing. Do you?
249,
250,"CLARA: No. No, look, fine. You know, if you think that there"
251,"is nothing to worry about, then that is fine by me."
252,
253,DOCTOR: Are you sure?
254,
255,"CLARA: Ah, yes, I'm sure."
256,
257,DOCTOR: To our last hurrah.
258,
259,"CLARA: Our last, yeah. I mean, it's not like I'm never going to see you"
260,again.
261,
262,DOCTOR: Isn't it?
263,
264,CLARA: Is it?
265,
266,DOCTOR: I thought that's what you wanted.
267,
268,"CLARA: No, what I mean, you're going to come round for dinner or"
269,"something, aren't you? Do you, do you do that? Do you come round to"
270,people's
271,houses for dinner?
272,DOCTOR: Of course. Why wouldn't I do that?
273,
274,CLARA: I don't know. I thought you might find it boring.
275,
276,DOCTOR: Is it boring?
277,
278,CLARA: No.
279,
280,(She raises her champagne flute.)
281,CLARA: To the last hurrah.
282,
283,DOCTOR: The last hurrah.
284,
285,(Clink.)
286,
287,[Doctor's sleeping compartment]
288,
289,(The Doctor is lying down on his bed. He flexes his
290,fingers and argues with himself.)
291,DOCTOR:
292,It's nothing. Nothing. Definitely. Sure. Ninety nine percent sure.
293,Really? Ninety nine percent? That's quite high. Is that the figure
294,"you're sticking with? Okay, okay. Seventy five. Well, that's jumped"
295,quite a bit. You've just lost twenty four percent.
296,
297,[Clara's sleeping compartment]
298,
299,"(Clara is in her room, in silk pajamas and making a"
300,phone call.)
301,
302,DANNY : A train in space? Sounds pretty cool.
303,
304,"CLARA: So, what are you saying? Just because he brought me somewhere"
305,"cool, I shouldn't dump him?"
306,
307,
308,[Danny's flat]
309,
310,"(He's ready for bed, too.)"
311,"DANNY: Well, one, you can't dump him because he's not your"
312,boyfriend. 
313,
314,[Clara's sleeping compartment]
315,
316,"DANNY : And two, dumping him sounds a little"
317,scorched
318,earth. 
319,
320,[Danny's flat]
321,
322,DANNY: You still basically get on. 
323,
324,[Clara's sleeping compartment]
325,
326,DANNY : I think
327,you should
328,just
329,enjoy your space 
330,
331,[Danny's flat]
332,
333,DANNY: Train. At least it's not dangerous.
334,
335,
336,[Clara's sleeping compartment]
337,
338,"CLARA: Yeah. It's pretty boring, really."
339,
340,
341,[Doctor's sleeping compartment]
342,
343,"DOCTOR: Because you know what this sounds like, don't"
344,"you? No, do"
345,tell me. A mummy that only the victim can see. I was being rhetorical.
346,I know exactly what this sounds like.
347,
348,(He puts on his jacket and goes out into the
349,corridor. )
350,
351,[Corridor]
352,
353,"(The Doctor hesitates outside Clara's door, nearly"
354,"knocks, then walks on. Clara comes out and knocks on the"
355,Doctor's door.)
356,"CLARA (whispering): Doctor, are you awake?"
357,
358,
359,[Engineer's carriage]
360,
361,"(Computer screens above a workbench, blueprints on a draughting table."
362,Racks of tools. The Doctor finds a piece of
363,"equipment bubbling to itself, and apparently powering up according to"
364,the display. He removes the plastic wrapping and scans
365,it with the screwdriver. The Chief Engineer startles him.)
366,"PERKINS: Beautiful bit of kit, isn't it, sir? The Excelsior Life"
367,Extender. It's like driving around in a portable hospital.
368,
369,(Perkins is holding a heavy piece of metal.)
370,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, it didn't do Mrs Pitt much good, did it?"
371,
372,"PERKINS: Got me there, sir. Certainly got me there. Maybe it"
373,malfunctioned.
374,
375,"DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think so. The records show that the machine did"
376,everything it could to keep her alive.
377,
378,PERKINS: Yeah. And almost drained the battery doing it.
379,
380,DOCTOR: What do you know?
381,
382,"PERKINS: Well, I know that when I find a man fiddling with a chair"
383,"that someone died in, it's best to play my cards close to my chest."
384,
385,"DOCTOR: Really? Well, I know that when I find a man loitering near a"
386,"chair that someone died in, I do just the same."
387,
388,PERKINS: Perkins. Chief Engineer.
389,
390,DOCTOR: The Doctor. Nosey Parker.
391,
392,"PERKINS: (chuckles) Pleased to meet you, Doctor. "
393,(They shake hands.) 
394,"PERKINS: Course, there's a rumour that someone or some thing"
395,else might be responsible.
396,
397,
398,[Corridor]
399,
400,(Clara has got dressed and come
401,out of her sleeping compartment again. She meets Maisie walking along
402,in her pajamas and
403,"holding her right shoe in her hand, and follows her.)"
404,CLARA: Hello? Are you okay? Hello? Excuse me? Excuse me? 
405,
406,[Baggage car]
407,
408,"CLARA: Miss Pitt, wasn't it? Are you all right? Do you"
409,need some help?
410,
411,MAISIE: My name's Maisie. I'm not mad.
412,
413,"CLARA: Oh, okay. Er, I didn't say you were, but you've had a bad"
414,day. I think anybody could do with a little bit of help after a day
415,like today.
416,(Maisie addresses the panel next to a heavy door at the end of the
417,baggage car. It is labelled Private Company Property)
418,
419,"MAISIE: Computer, open the door."
420,
421,GUS: Call me Gus. I'm afraid this door can only be opened by executive
422,order.
423,
424,(The thumbs down icon makes a sad noise.)
425,CLARA: Are you okay?
426,
427,(Maisie cries as she tries pressing buttons on the keypad.)
428,MAISIE: They won't let me see her body. They should let me see her
429,"body, shouldn't they?"
430,
431,"CLARA: Er, yeah, I should think so. It's in there, is it? Okay,"
432,I have a friend who's really good with locks. Do you want to come with
433,"me, see if we can find him?"
434,
435,MAISIE: Oh!
436,
437,(Maisie
438,slams the heel of her shoe into the door key pad and shorts it out. The
439,"icon changes to a telescope on a tripod, then the thumbs down, then"
440,cannot make up its mind. The door opens.)
441,CLARA:
442,"Or you could do that because that works, too."
443,
444,(Clara follows Maisie into the room and the door closes behind them.)
445,
446,[Lounge]
447,
448,(The Doctor walks up to a man with a thin
449,"moustache who is reading a book, and points at him.)"
450,DOCTOR: What's the most interesting thing about the Foretold?
451,
452,"MOORHOUSE: I'm terribly sorry, I don't believe we've met."
453,
454,DOCTOR: You know. The Foretold. Mythical mummy. Legend has it that if
455,"you see it, you're a dead man."
456,
457,"MOORHOUSE: Yes, I know what it is. You see, I happen to be "
458,"DOCTOR: Emil Moorhouse, professor of alien mythology. I'm the"
459,"Doctor. Pleased to meet you. So, the most interesting thing about the"
460,Foretold. Go.
461,
462,(The Doctor sits down on the other side of Moorhouse's small table.)
463,"MOORHOUSE: Er, well, it would have to be the time limit given"
464,before it kills you. I can't think of another myth where it's so
465,specific.
466,"How does it go? Er, The number of evil twice over. They that"
467,bear the Foretold's stare have sixty six seconds to live.
468,
469,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. Nice try. Very atmospheric. But that's not it. Try"
470,again.
471,
472,MOORHOUSE: A cynical man might say that you were trying to pump me for
473,information.
474,
475,DOCTOR: The myth of the Foretold first appeared over five thousand
476,years
477,"ago. In some stories, there is a riddle or secret word that is supposed"
478,"to make it stop. Some characters try to bargain with it, offer riches,"
479,confess sins. All to no avail.
480,
481,(The Doctor opens the silver cigarette case he has taken from his
482,jacket pocket and offers the Professor a
483,jelly baby.)
484,"MOORHOUSE: Well, you certainly know a little mythology."
485,
486,"DOCTOR: I know a lot. Because, from time to time, it turns out to be"
487,true.

492,"(The light flickers, the clock starts ticking, and the"
493,chef sees the mummy.)

496,CHEF: What is that?
497,
498,
499,[Lounge]
500,
501,"MOORHOUSE: But that's the great appeal, isn't it?"

508,

512,"MOORHOUSE: Earth legends are such dry, dusty affairs,"
513,"and always fiction. But up here, in the stars,"

518,(The unfortunate chef tries to use trolleys to stop the
519,mummy from getting to him.)

521,
522,CHEF: Get it away!
523,
524,[Saloon
525,car]
526,
527,MOORHOUSE: Anything's possible. That's why I chose this
528,"field, to be honest. Hoping one day I might meet a real monster."
529,
530,DOCTOR: Isn't that everyone's dream? But you still haven't answered
531,my riddle. What's the most interesting thing about the Foretold?
532,
533,"MOORHOUSE: Well, you can't run from it, that's for sure. There are"
534,"accounts of people trying, but it never works. No matter how far you"
535,"run, it's always right there behind you."
536,
537,
538,[Galley]
539,
540,CHEF 2: There's nothing there!

545,CHEF: Get it away! Get it away!

547,CHEF 2: What's wrong with him?
548,
549,CHEF: Get it away! Get it away!
550,
551,(At 18 seconds he retreats into the freezer.)
552,CHEF: Get it away! Get it away!

555,"CHEF 3: Stumpy, open the door."
556,
557,"CHEF 2: Yeah, open the door."

573,
574,"MOORHOUSE: All right, I give up, you tell me."
575,
576,"DOCTOR: Mrs Pitt, the old woman who died."
577,
578,MOORHOUSE: She died of old age. Nothing supernatural.
579,
580,DOCTOR: No. That's my answer.

582,MOORHOUSE: Her death?
583,
584,DOCTOR: No. The fact that you were here to witness it.

608,CLARA: Nope. But I do need to be slightly more skilled than a
609,high-heeled shoe.
610,
611,MAISIE: Do you ever wish bad things on people?
612,
613,"CLARA: Oh, yeah. All the time. Whoever designed this door, for a start."
614,
615,MAISIE: She wasn't really my mum. She just made me call her that. She
616,was my gran. Do you know why I wanted to see her body?
617,
618,CLARA: Because you loved her very much and were missing her?
619,
620,"MAISIE: (chuckles) No. You obviously never met her. No, I just"
621,felt really guilty. Like I'd been picturing her dying for years. Like a
622,"daydream. Not really meaning it. At least, I don't think I did. But"
623,"now, it just feels like I made this happen."
624,
625,(Clara abandons the lock.)
626,"CLARA: Hey, listen. You didn't do anything wrong. Difficult"
627,"people, they can make you feel all sorts of things. But you"
628,didn't do it. You didn't kill her. She just died.
629,

631,

646,
647,"DOCTOR: Really? That's your worst? Okay, I'm a mystery shopper. I"
648,could do with an extra pillow and I'm very disappointed with your
649,breakfast bar and all of the dying.

658,
659,"DOCTOR: Come on, Captain. Where would we all be if we all followed"
660,"our job descriptions, hmm? Good question. Glad you asked. In your case,"
661,you'd be doing something instead of climbing inside a bottle.
662,
663,QUELL: I have followed the procedure for accidental death to the
664,letter.
665,
666,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sure you have. And I'm sure you do just enough of your"
667,job to avoid complaints.

670,
671,"DOCTOR: Wounded in battle, honourable discharge. And this is just a"
672,"guess, but I think you've had the fight knocked out of you. You"
673,expected this to be a cushy desk job where you could put your head down
674,"until retirement. Well, I'm sorry. As of today, that dream is over."
675,
676,QUELL: There is no evidence of any attack or other parties 
677,"DOCTOR: Yes, let's just sit around and wait for the evidence while"
678,the bodies pile up. Or here's a crazy thought. We could do something
679,to stop it. Why am I even talking to you?

969,exactly sixty six seconds left
970,in which to live. But that isn't even the strangest thing. Do you know
971,"what is? You. The passengers. Experts in alien biology, mythology,"
972,"physics. If I was putting together a team to analyse this thing, I'd"
973,pick you. And I think somebody has. Someone of immense power and
974,influence has orchestrated this whole trip. Someone who I have no doubt

1000,after which we will reverse engineer its abilities. Isn't this
1001,exciting?
1002,
1003,"DOCTOR: You said capture, implying that you can't control this"

1005,
1006,"GUS: There is an artefact, an ancient scroll. I have"

1010,small spotlight turns to illuminate the scroll on the door at

1013,"interesting as that is really marks made in moist clay, not painted on"
1014,papyrus or fabric.)

1025,
1026,"GUS: That is your choice, of course. But it would"
1027,be very upsetting were you all to die at the hands of the Foretold.
1028,
1029,"PERKINS: So hurry up, before it kills you."
1030,
1031,"DOCTOR: But even if they agree to this, how are they supposed to"
1032,study a creature that they can't even see? We don't even know what the
1033,species is.

1053,to tell you.

1056,what you can see. Even the smallest detail might help save the next
1057,one.
1058,
1059,MOORHOUSE: The next one? You mean you can't save me?

1153,
1154,CLARA: The Gloriana spent three
1155,days getting picked off by the Foretold. All died. Performance marked
1156,as poor.
1157,
1158,
1159,[Galley]
1160,
1161,GUS: Warning. Decompression imminent. Please vacate the
1162,area.
1163,
1164,CHEF 2: No!
1165,
1166,[Secure room]
1167,
1168,"CLARA: The Valiant Heart. Forty two crew, four died."

1170,
1171,[Laboratory]
1172,
1173,"CLARA : Performance, promising."
1174,GUS: Please terminate the call and return to work.
1175,
1176,QUELL: I think you should do as it says.
1177,
1178,(Because the catering staff and equipment are floating past the window.)
1179,"DOCTOR: Clara, I have to go."
1180,
1181,GUS: I'm sorry. I know that must have been distressing for
1182,"you. But if you are disobedient again, I will decompress another area"
1183,containing less valuable passengers.
1184,DOCTOR: Less valuable passengers? How does it choose?
1185,
1186,"PERKINS: Well, I'm assuming qualifications "
1187,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. Not the computer, the Foretold. How does it"
1188,choose who to kill? We've assumed it's random. What if it's not? I want
1189,"full histories on all the victims. Medical, social, personal."
1190,
1191,GUS: Well done.
1192,
1193,DOCTOR: Don't mention it.
1194,
1195,"(Later, looking at a tablet computer.)"
1196,"PERKINS: Doesn't seem to be any pattern. Their travel history,"
1197,"interests, health. It's all over the shop. Health?"
1198,
1199,"DOCTOR: Health? Are you sure? Mrs Pitt, the first victim. She was over"
1200,a hundred years old. The frailest passenger on board.
1201,
1202,"PERKINS: Oh but the next to go, the chef, was young and fit. It's"
1203,random.
1204,
1205,QUELL: The chef was ill.
1206,
1207,DOCTOR: What?
1208,
1209,"QUELL: A rare blood disorder. Not contagious, but we kept it quiet."
1210,
1211,"DOCTOR: Because he worked with food. The next one, the guard?"
1212,
1213,"QUELL: He wasn't ill as such, but he did have synthetic lungs implanted"
1214,last year.
1215,
1216,PERKINS: Professor Moorhouse. It seems he was physically fine but
1217,"suffering from, here we are. Regular panic attacks after a car"
1218,crash last year.
1219,DOCTOR: It's picking off the weakest first. Sensing the illness
1220,"somehow. The fake organs, even psychological issues. But this is good"
1221,"news,"
1222,because it means we can work out who is next. I want the medical
1223,records of everybody alive who is still on board. If anyone's had as
1224,"much as a cold, I want to know about it."
1225,
1226,QUELL: You really think it can sense psychological issues?
1227,
1228,DOCTOR: It seems so. Why?
1229,
1230,"QUELL: When you said I'd lost the stomach for a fight, I wasn't"
1231,"wounded in battle as such, but. My unit was bombed. I was the"
1232,sole survivor. Not a scratch on me. But post-traumatic stress.
1233,Nightmares. Still can't sleep without pills.
1234,
1235,DOCTOR: Which means that you are probably next. Which is good to know.
1236,
1237,"QUELL: Well, not for me."
1238,
1239,"DOCTOR: Well, of course not for you, because you're going to die. But I"
1240,"mean for us, from a research point of view."
1241,
1242,"QUELL: You know, for a doctor, your bedside manner leaves"
1243,(Lights flicker.)
1244,"DOCTOR: Well, there's goes our head start. Perkins, start the clock."
1245,(The mummy appears at the far end of the carriage.)
1246,DOCTOR: What can you see?
1247,
1248,QUELL: Almost feels out of focus. Gives me a headache just looking at
1249,it.
1250,
1251,(Quell draws his service weapon.)
1252,"DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no, no. That didn't work before."
1253,
1254,"QUELL: What kind of soldier would I be, dying with bullets in my gun?"
1255,
1256,(Quell shoots a flask.)
1257,PERKINS: Fifty seconds.
1258,
1259,"QUELL: Someone shut that man up! For the record, it didn't even flinch."
1260,
1261,DOCTOR: Where is it now?
1262,
1263,QUELL: Approximately twenty feet in front of me and closing.
1264,
1265,PERKINS: Forty seconds.
1266,
1267,DOCTOR: Am I close?
1268,
1269,(We are treated to the view of the mummy's outstretched fingers coming
1270,out of the Doctor's eyes before the rest of its bandaged hand passes
1271,through his head.)
1272,"QUELL: It's passing right through you, like a ghost."
1273,
1274,(Perkins is holding out a scanner and reading his tablet.)
1275,PERKINS: It's not a hologram.
1276,
1277,"DOCTOR: If you move, will it follow?"
1278,
1279,QUELL: Do you want me to move? Because I can certainly do that.
1280,
1281,"DOCTOR: Keep looking at it, but back off quick as you like."
1282,
1283,QUELL: It's teleported away. It's behind me.
1284,
1285,PERKINS: Twenty seconds.
1286,
1287,"QUELL: I think this is it. Still, suppose it's not a bad way to go."
1288,"Blood pumping, enemy at the gates and all that. And thank you, Doctor,"
1289,for waking me up. It's reaching for me. Hands on my head.
1290,
1291,PERKINS: Zero.
1292,
1293,QUELL: Ah!
1294,
1295,DOCTOR: Teleporter. That means tech. Then sixty six seconds to do
1296,"what? Sixty six seconds. That seems very, very specific. Too specific"
1297,for organic.
1298,"So, what, more tech? What? More? A countdown clock? Something charging?"
1299,
1300,PERKINS: A man just died in front of us. Can we not just have a moment?
1301,
1302,"DOCTOR: No. No, no, no. We can't do that. We can't mourn. People"
1303,"with guns to their heads, they cannot mourn. We do not have time to"
1304,"mourn. Everybody, what takes sixty six seconds to charge up or to"
1305,change
1306,state? Anyone? Am I surrounded by idiots? If only I could see
1307,this thing.
1308,PERKINS: Don't even joke about that.
1309,
1310,"DOCTOR: I'm not joking about it. One minute with me and this thing, it"
1311,would be over!
1312,
1313,"PERKINS: You know, Doctor, I can't tell if you're a genius or just"
1314,incredibly arrogant.
1315,
1316,"DOCTOR: Well, ah, on a good day, I'm both. Ancient tech. This thing"
1317,has been around for centuries. How? Tech that keeps it alive. Tech that
1318,drains energy from the living. Scanner. 
1319,"(He takes Perkin's scanner and uses it on Quell's corpse, then throws"
1320,it back to Perkins.)
1321,DOCTOR: Deep tissue scan. He's
1322,been leached of almost all energy on a cellular level. The heart attack
1323,"is just a, is just a side effect."
1324,
1325,"PERKINS: Oh, it's not just a mummy, it's a vampire. Metaphorically"
1326,speaking.
1327,
1328,DOCTOR: But why take sixty six seconds to drain us? Why not just
1329,pounce?
1330,
1331,"PERKINS: Phase. Moving energy out of phase. That takes about a minute,"
1332,doesn't it?
1333,
1334,DOCTOR: That's why only the victims can see it. It takes them out
1335,"of phase so it can drain their energy. You, sir, are a genius! This"
1336,explains everything! Apart from what it is and how it's doing it.
1337,"Sorry, I jumped the gun there with the you're a genius, that"
1338,explains
1339,everything remark.
1340,
1341,"PERKINS: Doctor, I think we know the next victim."
1342,
1343,(Perkins hands the Doctor his tablet.)
1344,"DOCTOR: Ah, of course. That makes perfect sense."
1345,
1346,
1347,[Strong room]
1348,
1349,(He phones Clara.)
1350,"CLARA: (sotto) Look, she's had a bad day. That's all."
1351,
1352,"DOCTOR : Clara, it doesn't care. "
1353,
1354,[Laboratory]
1355,
1356,"DOCTOR: Her bad day, her"
1357,"bereavement, her little breakdown puts her squarely in its cross hairs."
1358,She's next. 
1359,
1360,[Strong room]
1361,
1362,DOCTOR : Every simulation we've run confirms it.
1363,
1364,"CLARA: Okay, but, but we're in here and, if we stay in here, that thing"
1365,can't 
1366,DOCTOR : This thing can teleport. 
1367,
1368,[Laboratory]
1369,
1370,DOCTOR: We need her here. Even the computer agrees.
1371,
1372,
1373,[Strong room]
1374,
1375,"CLARA: Okay, so you can save her? Right?"
1376,
1377,
1378,[Laboratory]
1379,
1380,DOCTOR: Of course not. Why would you think that? This is another chance
1381,
1382,
1383,[Strong room]
1384,
1385,DOCTOR : To observe it in action.
1386,
1387,CLARA: As it kills her.
1388,
1389,"DOCTOR : Of course, as it kills her. "
1390,
1391,[Laboratory]
1392,
1393,"DOCTOR: If it happens in there, it'll be a waste "
1394,
1395,[Strong room]
1396,
1397,DOCTOR : So bring her to us.
1398,
1399,CLARA: How? How exactly? She's never going to agree to this.
1400,
1401,
1402,[Laboratory]
1403,
1404,"DOCTOR: Well, I don't know. Lie to her. Tell her I can save her."
1405,Whatever it takes to get her here.
1406,
1407,(Perkins watches closely as the Doctor throws down the phone and walks
1408,away.)
1409,
1410,[Strong room]
1411,
1412,MAISIE: What's he saying?
1413,
1414,CLARA: He says. He says he can save you.
1415,
1416,
1417,[Baggage car]
1418,
1419,(The
1420,strong room door opens and they walk out.)
1421,MAISIE: I knew he could get us out of
1422,there. I told
1423,"you, he's a good man."
1424,
1425,"(Clara tries to walk past the door to the corridor, to the Tardis. The"
1426,air wibbles as it stops her. The strong room door closes with a ting!)
1427,"CLARA: Yes. Yes, he is."
1428,
1429,"MAISIE: And to be honest, I don't know how convinced I am by"
1430,"this trauma sense thing, but if the Doctor says he can help me"
1431,"anyway,"
1432,"I mean, that has to be a good thing, doesn't it, Clara?"
1433,
1434,
1435,[Laboratory]
1436,
1437,(Gus opens the door and lets the women in. The Doctor
1438,runs to shake Maisie's hand.)
1439,"MAISIE: Hello, again. I'm Maisie."
1440,
1441,DOCTOR: Good for you.
1442,
1443,CLARA: We passed the Tardis on the way here. Thought about getting
1444,"inside, hiding, pulling the levers and hoping for the best."
1445,But we
1446,couldn't even get in. There was a forcefield around it.
1447,(The Doctor uses Perkins' scanner on Maisie.)
1448,
1449,DOCTOR: It's probably Gus trying to block our escape route.
1450,
1451,CLARA: But how does he even know what it is? Cos if he knows what it
1452,"is, then he knows what you are."
1453,
1454,"DOCTOR: Well, he has tried to entice me here before. Free tickets,"
1455,"mysterious summons, he even phoned the Tardis number. Do you know how"
1456,difficult a number
1457,CLARA: You knew. You knew this was no relaxing break. You knew this was
1458,dangerous.
1459,
1460,DOCTOR: I didn't know. I certainly hoped.
1461,
1462,"CLARA: Okay, this. You see, this. This is why I'm leaving you. This."
1463,"Because you lied. You lied to me, again. And now you've made me lie."
1464,You've made me your accomplice.
1465,
1466,MAISIE: What? Sorry? When did you lie? Clara?
1467,
1468,"CLARA: Maisie, I am, I am so sorry."
1469,
1470,(Maisie points at the mummy as the lights flicker.)
1471,PERKINS: Do we start the clock?
1472,
1473,DOCTOR: Not yet.
1474,
1475,(The Doctor stands in front of Maisie and flashes the scanner in her
1476,face.)
1477,"DOCTOR: Focus. Focus. Focus! All of that is your grief, your trauma,"
1478,your resentment. And now 
1479,(He puts the scanner to his own head and zaps himself.)
1480,DOCTOR: It's mine.
1481,
1482,(The mummy growls and vanishes.)
1483,MAISIE: It's gone.
1484,
1485,"DOCTOR: No. No, it's not. Not for me. Cos now it thinks I'm you. "
1486,(He throws the scanner onto a table.)
1487,DOCTOR: Start the clock. (to the mummy) Hello.
1488,
1489,(It reaches for him.)
1490,DOCTOR: I'm so pleased to finally see you. I'm the Doctor and I
1491,will be your victim this evening. Are you
1492,my mummy? But you can't
1493,hurt
1494,me until my time is up. I think. So are there magic words? Is there a
1495,"way to stop you in your tracks? Oh, you really didn't like your gran,"
1496,"did you? There's something visible under the bandages. By the way, you"
1497,weren't being paranoid. She really did poison your pony.
1498,
1499,MAISIE: Oh!
1500,
1501,"DOCTOR: Markings like the ones the scroll. Oh, and your father. Sorry."
1502,
1503,MAISIE: What 
1504,DOCTOR: A tattered piece of cloth attached to a length of wood that you
1505,will kill for.
1506,
1507,PERKINS: Thirty seconds.
1508,
1509,DOCTOR: That doesn't sound like a scroll. That sounds like a
1510,"flag! And if that sounds like a flag, if this is a flag, that means"
1511,"that you are a soldier, wounded in a forgotten war thousands of"
1512,"years ago. But they've worked on you, haven't they, son? They've filled"
1513,"you full of kit. State of the art phase camouflage, personal"
1514,teleporter.
1515,
1516,PERKINS: Ten seconds.
1517,
1518,"DOCTOR: And all that tech inside you, it just won't let you die,"
1519,will it? It won't let the war end. It just won't let you stop until the
1520,war is over. We surrender.
1521,
1522,PERKINS: Zero.
1523,
1524,MAISIE: (gasps) I can see it again.
1525,
1526,(The mummy steps back from the Doctor and lowers its arms.)
1527,CLARA: It's okay. I think we all can.
1528,
1529,PERKINS: Do I start the clock?
1530,
1531,DOCTOR: No.
1532,
1533,(The mummy salutes the Doctor.)
1534,"DOCTOR: The clock has stopped. You're relieved, soldier."
1535,
1536,(The mummy disintegrates into a pile of dust and old bandages.)
1537,PERKINS: Phew. He's not the only one.
1538,
1539,(The Doctor picks up a piece of blue tech with
1540,wires from the remains.)
1541,CLARA:
1542,We were fighting that?
1543,
1544,DOCTOR: So was he.
1545,
1546,"CLARA: Listen, what I said "
1547,"DOCTOR: Save it. We're not out of the woods yet. Well, Gus, I think"
1548,we solved your little puzzle. Ancient soldier being driven by
1549,malfunctioning tech.
1550,
1551,GUS: Thank you so much for your efforts. They are greatly
1552,"appreciated. Unfortunately, survivors of this exercise are not"
1553,required.
1554,
1555,"(The Doctor has sonicked the tech, and now gets another tool from a"
1556,different table.)
1557,"DOCTOR: Ah, well, there's a shocker."
1558,
1559,"(People clutch their throats, gasping.)"
1560,GUS: Air will now be removed from the entire train. We hope you have
1561,enjoyed your journey on the Orient Express.
1562,
1563,CLARA: I take it you know a way out?
1564,
1565,DOCTOR: My enemy's enemy is my friend. Especially when he has a built
1566,in teleporter.
1567,
1568,(Perkins and Maisie pass out.)
1569,CLARA: Great! So use it!
1570,
1571,DOCTOR: A little more work.
1572,
1573,CLARA: Doctor!
1574,
1575,DOCTOR: Couple of minutes. Max. I'll give you a shout.
1576,
1577,(Clara hits the floor with an unlady-like thud. The Orient Express
1578,explodes.)

1580,[Pebble beach]
1581,
1582,(Clara
1583,wakes up wrapped in a blanket and lying on another plaid one. The
1584,Doctor is back in his dark blue suit sans tie and is scratching at the
1585,"little visible sand with a stick, doing his Gallefreyan maths."
1586,The sky is pink.)
1587,"DOCTOR: Oh hello, again. Sleep well?"
1588,
1589,CLARA: Weren't we just on a train?
1590,
1591,"DOCTOR: Oh, that was ages ago."
1592,
1593,CLARA: And?
1594,
1595,"DOCTOR: And what? Oh, and we got off the train. Oh, well, the"
1596,teleporter worked eventually. Beamed everyone into the Tardis. No
1597,"casualties, just a bevy of sleeping beauties. I tried hacking Gus from"
1598,"the Tardis, find out who set this all up. He really didn't like that."
1599,Set off some fail-safe thing. Blew up the train.
1600,
1601,CLARA: Blew up the train?
1602,
1603,DOCTOR: Blew up the train. But we got away. Then I dropped everyone
1604,"off at the nearest civilised planet, which happened to be here. "
1605,(View of a city with tall pointed buildings in the
1606,background.)
1607,DOCTOR: You
1608,seemed happy asleep so I just left you.
1609,
1610,CLARA: So you saved everyone.
1611,
1612,"DOCTOR: No, I just saved you and I let everyone else suffocate. Ha, ha,"
1613,ha. 
1614,CLARA: Hmm. 
1615,"DOCTOR: Yeah, this is just my cover story."
1616,
1617,"CLARA: So, when you lied to Maisie, when you made me lie to Maisie "
1618,DOCTOR: I couldn't risk Gus finding out my plan and stopping me.
1619,
1620,CLARA: So you were pretending to be heartless.
1621,
1622,DOCTOR: Would you like to think that about me? Would that make it
1623,"easier? I didn't know if I could save her. I couldn't save Quell, I"
1624,couldn't save Moorhouse. There was a good chance that she'd die too. At
1625,"which point, I would have just moved onto the next, and the"
1626,"next, until I beat it. Sometimes the only choices you have are"
1627,bad ones. But you still have to choose.
1628,
1629,
1630,[Tardis]
1631,
1632,(Perkins is looking at the workings under the time rotor.)
1633,"PERKINS: Er, it's er, quite a vehicle you have here, Doctor."
1634,"I won't pretend to understand half of it. Having said that, I did"
1635,notice you've got a couple of drive stacks need replacing. 
1636,"DOCTOR: Oh, you did, did you?"
1637,
1638,PERKINS: Yeah. You should get someone in. And a job like that takes
1639,forever.
1640,
1641,"DOCTOR: Really? Well, I suppose, whoever I did get in, it might"
1642,just be easier to have them stay on board for a while. I don't suppose
1643,you'd know of anyone?
1644,
1645,"PERKINS: No. Sorry, Doctor, but I don't think I do. That job could er,"
1646,change a man.
1647,
1648,"DOCTOR: Yes, it does. Frequently. "
1649,(They go back up to the main deck where Clara is walking around with
1650,"her mobile phone in hand, still in her 1920s costume.)"
1651,"DOCTOR: Well, I won't keep you. Goodbye,"
1652,Perkins. Good to meet you.
1653,
1654,"PERKINS: You too, Doctor. And er, good luck."
1655,
1656,(They shake. Perkins touches his cap to Clara on his way out.)
1657,CLARA: Do you love it?
1658,
1659,DOCTOR: Love what?
1660,
1661,"CLARA: I know it's scary and difficult, but do you love being the man"
1662,making the impossible choice?
1663,
1664,DOCTOR: Why would I?
1665,
1666,"CLARA: Because it's what you do, all day, every day."
1667,
1668,DOCTOR: It's my life.
1669,
1670,CLARA: Doesn't have to be. Is it like 
1671,DOCTOR: Like what?
1672,
1673,CLARA: An addiction?
1674,
1675,DOCTOR: You can't really tell if something's an addiction till you try
1676,and give it up.
1677,
1678,CLARA: And you never have.
1679,
1680,DOCTOR: Let me know how it goes.
