21,DALEK: You know the Doctor. You understand him. You
22,will predict his actions. 
23,"ROSE: I don't know! And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you. "
24,DALEK: Predict! Predict! Predict! 
25,DALEK 2: Tardis detected in flight. 
26,DALEK: Launch missiles. Exterminate. 
27,ROSE: You can't! The Tardis hasn't got any defences. You're going to
28,kill him. 
29,DALEK: You have predicted correctly. 
30,[Tardis]
31,
32,JACK: We've got incoming! 
33,"(The Dalek missiles strike the Tardis, and there is a big fireball in"
34,the vacuum of space. Neat trick.) 
35,JACK: The extrapolator's working. We've got a fully functional
36,forcefield. Try saying that when you're drunk. 
37,DOCTOR: And for my next trick. 
38,(The Tardis materialises around Rose and the nearest Dalek.) 
39,"DOCTOR: Rose, get down! Get down, Rose! "
40,DALEK: Exterminate! 
41,(The Dalek fires and misses. Jack takes out the Dalek with the modified
42,Defabricator.) 
43,ROSE: You did it. 
44,(The Doctor hugs Rose.) 
45,ROSE: Feels like I haven't seem you in years. 
46,DOCTOR: I told you I'd come and get you. 
47,ROSE: Never doubted it. 
48,DOCTOR: I did. You all right? 
49,ROSE: Yeah. You? 
50,"DOCTOR: Not bad, been better. "
51,"JACK: Hey, don't I get a hug? "
52,"ROSE: Oh, come here! "
53,JACK: I was talking to him. 
54,(Jack hugs Rose anyway.) 
55,JACK: Welcome home. 
56,"ROSE: Oh, I thought I'd never see you again. "
57,"JACK: Oh, you were lucky. That was just a one shot wonder. Drained the"
58,gun of all its power supply. Now it's just a piece of junk.
59,
60,[Spaceship]
61,
62,"EMPEROR : Patience, my brethren. "
63,[Tardis]
64,
65,ROSE: You said they were extinct. How comes they're
66,still alive? 
67,"JACK: One minute they're the greatest threat in the Universe, the next"
68,minute they vanished out of time and space. 
69,DOCTOR: They went off to fight a bigger war. The Time War 
70,JACK: I thought that was just a legend. 
71,"DOCTOR: I was there. The war between the Daleks and the Time Lords,"
72,"with the whole of creation at stake. My people were destroyed, but they"
73,took the Daleks with them. I almost thought it was worth it. Now it
74,turns out they died for nothing. 
75,ROSE: There's thousands of them now. We could hardly stop one. What're
76,we going to do? 
77,"DOCTOR: No good stood round here chin wagging. Human race, you'd gossip"
78,all day. The Daleks have got the answers. Let's go and meet the
79,neighbours. 
80,ROSE: You can't go out there!
81,
82,[Spaceship]
83,
84,DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! 
85,(The Dalek rays are stopped by a forcefield extending a good three
86,metres out from the Tardis.) 
87,"DOCTOR: Is that it? Useless! Nul points. It's all right, come on out."
88,That forcefield can hold back anything. 
89,JACK: Almost anything. 
90,"DOCTOR: Yes, but I wasn't going to tell them that. Thanks. "
91,JACK: Sorry. 
92,DOCTOR: Do you know what they call me in the ancient legends of the
93,Dalek Homeworld? The Oncoming Storm. You might've removed all your
94,"emotions but I reckon right down deep in your DNA, there's one little"
95,"spark left, and that's fear. Doesn't it just burn when you face me? So"
96,tell me. How did you survive the Time War? 
97,EMPEROR : They survived through me. 
98,"(The lights come up to reveal a large apparatus, which on closer"
99,inspection is an exploded giant
100,"Dalek casing, and a blue-skinned one-eyed mutant is happy for everyone"
101,to see it
102,sitting there as if on its throne..) 
103,"DOCTOR: Rose, Captain, this is the Emperor of the Daleks. "
104,"EMPEROR: You destroyed us, Doctor. The Dalek race died in your inferno,"
105,"but my ship survived, falling through time, crippled but alive. "
106,DOCTOR: I get it. 
107,DALEK: Do not interrupt. 
108,DALEK 2: Do not interrupt. 
109,DALEK 3: Do not interrupt. 
110,"DOCTOR: I think you're forgetting something. I'm the Doctor, and if"
111,"there's one thing I can do, it's talk. I've got five billion languages,"
112,and you haven't got one way of stopping me. So if anybody's going to
113,"shut up, it's you! Okey doke. So, where were we? "
114,"EMPEROR: We waited here in the dark space, damaged but rebuilding."
115,"Centuries passed, and we quietly infiltrated the systems of Earth,"
116,"harvesting the waste of humanity. The prisoners, the refugees, the"
117,"dispossessed. They all came to us. The bodies were filtered, pulped,"
118,sifted. The seed of the human race is perverted. Only one cell in a
119,billion was fit to be nurtured. 
120,DOCTOR: So you created an army of Daleks out of the dead. 
121,ROSE: That makes them half human. 
122,EMPEROR: Those words are blasphemy. 
123,DALEK: Do not blaspheme. 
124,DALEK 2: Do not blaspheme. 
125,DALEK 3: Do not blaspheme. 
126,EMPEROR: Everything human has been purged. I cultivated pure and
127,blessed Dalek. 
128,DOCTOR: Since when did the Daleks have a concept of blasphemy? 
129,EMPEROR: I reached into the dirt and made new life. I am the God of all
130,Daleks! 
131,DALEKS: Worship him. Worship him. Worship him. 
132,"DOCTOR: They're insane. Hiding in silence for hundreds of years, that's"
133,enough to drive anyone mad. But it's worse than that. Driven mad by
134,your own flesh. The stink of humanity. You hate your own existence. And
135,that makes them more deadly than ever. We're going. 
136,EMPEROR: You may not leave my presence. 
137,DALEK: Stay where you are. 
138,DALEKS: Exterminate! 
139,"(The Doctor, Rose and Jack go back inside the Tardis. The Daleks start"
140,shooting at the forcefield again.) 
141,DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate!
142,
143,[Tardis]
144,
145,DALEKS : Exterminate! Exterminate! Worship him!
146,You will be exterminated!
147,
148,[Floor 500]
149,
150,(The Tardis materialises.) 
151,"DOCTOR: Turn everything up. All transmitters full power, wide open."
152,Now! Do it! 
153,PAVALE: What does this do? 
154,DOCTOR: Stops the Daleks from transmatting on board. How did you get
155,on? Did you contact Earth? 
156,"PAVALE: Well, we tried to warn them, but all they did was suspend our"
157,license because we stopped the programmes. 
158,"DOCTOR: And the planet's just sitting there, defenceless. Lynda,"
159,what're you still doing on board? I told you to evacuate everyone. 
160,PAVALE: She wouldn't go. 
161,LYNDA: Didn't want to leave you. 
162,"WOMAN: There weren't enough shuttles anyway, or I wouldn't be here."
163,We've got about a hundred people stranded on Floor Zero. 
164,[Floor Zero] 
165,"RODRICK: Listen, listen. My name's Rodrick. I won"
166,the game! Where's my money? Is anyone listening? Where's my money?!
167,
168,[Floor 500]
169,
170,"PAVALE: Oh, my God. The Fleet is moving. They're on"
171,their way. 
172,[Spaceship]
173,
174,EMPEROR: Purify the Earth with fire. The planet
175,will become my temple and we shall rise. This will be our paradise. 
176,[Floor 500]
177,
178,(The Doctor is pulling bits out of the conduits.) 
179,"DOCTOR: Dalek plan. Big mistake, because what have they left me with?"
180,"Anyone? Anyone? Oh, come on, it's obvious. A great big transmitter."
181,"This station. If I can change the signal, fold it back, sequence it,"
182,anyone? 
183,JACK: You've got to be kidding. 
184,DOCTOR: Give the man a medal. 
185,JACK: A Delta Wave? 
186,DOCTOR: A Delta Wave! 
187,ROSE: What's a Delta Wave? 
188,JACK: A wave of Van Cassadyne energy. It fries your brain. Stand in the
189,way of a Delta Wave and your head gets barbequed. 
190,DOCTOR: And this place can transmit a massive wave. Wipe out the
191,Daleks! 
192,"LYNDA: Well, get started and do it then. "
193,"DOCTOR: Trouble is, wave this size, building this big, brain as clever"
194,"as mine, should take about, oh, three days? How long till the Fleet"
195,arrive? 
196,PAVALE: Twenty two minutes. 
197,"(Later, after some rerouting of bits and pieces.) "
198,"JACK: We've now got a forcefield so they can't blast us out of the sky,"
199,but that doesn't stop the Daleks from physically invading. 
200,PAVALE: Do they know about the Delta Wave? 
201,"JACK: They'll have worked it out at the same time. So, they want to"
202,"stop the Doctor. That means they've got to get to this level, five"
203,"hundred. Now, I can concentrate the extrapolator around the top six"
204,"levels, five hundred to four nine five. So they'll penetrate the"
205,station below that at level four nine four and fight their way up. 
206,PAVALE: Who are they fighting? 
207,JACK: Us. 
208,PAVALE: And what are we fighting with? 
209,JACK: The guards had guns with bastic bullets. That's enough to blow a
210,Dalek wide open. 
211,WOMAN: There's five of us. 
212,"DOCTOR: Rose, you can help me. I need all these wires stripping bare. "
213,"WOMAN: Right, now there's four of us. "
214,JACK: Then let's move it. Into the lift. Isolate the lift controls. 
215,(Pavale and his colleague run off.) 
216,"LYNDA: I just want to say, er, thanks, I suppose, and I'll do my best. "
217,DOCTOR: Me too. 
218,(They shake hands and Lynda moves away.) 
219,"JACK: It's been fun, but I guess this is goodbye. "
220,ROSE: Don't talk like that. The Doctor's going to do it. You just watch
221,him. 
222,"JACK: Rose, you are worth fighting for. (kisses her) Wish I'd never met"
223,"you, Doctor. I was much better off as a coward. "
224,(Jack kisses the Doctor.) 
225,JACK: See you in hell. 
226,(Jack leaves.) 
227,"ROSE: He's going to be all right, isn't he? "
228,[Floor Zero]
229,
230,(Jack stands on a pile of crates and fires a
231,machine gun into the air to get some attention.) 
232,JACK: One last time! Any more volunteers? There's an army about to
233,invade this station. I need every last citizen to mount a defence. 
234,RODRICK: Don't listen to him. There aren't any Daleks. They disappeared
235,thousands of years ago. 
236,(The Floor Manager volunteers.) 
237,"JACK: Thanks. As for the rest of you, the Daleks will enter the station"
238,"at floor four nine four and as far as I can tell, they'll head up, not"
239,down. But that's not a promise. So here's a few words of advice. Keep
240,"quiet. And if you hear fighting up above, if you hear us dying, then"
241,tell me that the Daleks aren't real. Don't make a sound. Let's go. 
242,"(Jack, Lynda and the few volunteers all get in the lift.)"
243,
244,[Floor 500]
245,
246,ROSE: Suppose. 
247,DOCTOR: What? 
248,ROSE: Nothing. 
249,DOCTOR: You said suppose. 
250,"ROSE: No, I was just thinking. I mean, obviously you can't, but, you've"
251,got a time machine. Why can't you just go back to last week and warn
252,them? 
253,"DOCTOR: As soon as the Tardis lands in that second, I become part of"
254,"events, stuck in the timeline. "
255,"ROSE: Yeah, thought it'd be something like that "
256,DOCTOR: There's another thing the Tardis could do. It could take us
257,away. We could leave. Let history take its course. We go to Marbella in
258,1989. 
259,"ROSE: Yeah, but you'd never do that. "
260,"DOCTOR: No, but you could ask. Never even occurred to you, did it? "
261,"ROSE: Well, I'm just too good. "
262,DOCTOR: The Delta Wave's started building. How long does it need? 
263,(They run over to a console.) 
264,"ROSE: Is that bad? Okay, it's bad. How bad is it? "
265,"DOCTOR: Rose Tyler, you're a genius! We can do it. If I use the Tardis"
266,to cross my old timeline. Yes! 
267,[Tardis]
268,
269,DOCTOR: Hold that down and keep position. 
270,ROSE: What's it do? 
271,DOCTOR: Cancels the buffers. If I'm very clever and I'm more than
272,"clever, I'm brilliant, I might just save the world. Or rip it apart "
273,ROSE: I'd go for the first one. 
274,"DOCTOR: Me too. Now, I've just got to go and power up the Game Station."
275,Hold on! 
276,(The Doctor runs out and stops in the midst of his mares-nest of
277,cables. He looks back at the Tardis then points the sonic screwdriver
278,at it. The engines start.) 
279,"ROSE: Doctor, what're you doing? Can I take my hand off? It's moving. "
280,(Rose runs to the door.)
281,"ROSE: Doctor, let me out! "
282,[Floor 500]
283,
284,"ROSE : Let me out! Doctor, what've you done? "
285,(The Tardis dematerialises.)
286,
287,[Tardis]
288,
289,(A hologram appears.) 
290,"HOLO-DOCTOR: This is Emergency Programme One. Rose, now listen, this is"
291,"important. If this message is activated, then it can only mean one"
292,thing. We must be in danger. And I mean fatal. I'm dead or about to die
293,any second with no chance of escape. 
294,ROSE: No! 
295,DOCTOR: And that's okay. Hope it's a good death. But I promised to look
296,"after you, and that's what I'm doing. The Tardis is taking you home. "
297,ROSE: I won't let you. 
298,HOLO-DOCTOR: And I bet you're fussing and moaning now. Typical. But
299,hold on and just listen a bit more. The Tardis can never return for me.
300,Emergency Programme One means I'm facing an enemy that should never get
301,their hands on this machine. So this is what you should do. Let the
302,Tardis die. Just let this old box gather dust. No one can open it. No
303,one'll even notice it. Let it become a strange little thing standing on
304,"a street corner. And over the years, the world'll move on and the box"
305,"will be buried. And if you want to remember me, then you can do one"
306,"thing. That's all, one thing. Have a good life. Do that for me, Rose."
307,Have a fantastic life. 
308,(The hologram flickers out.) 
309,ROSE: You can't do this to me. You can't. Take me back! Take me back!
310,No! 
311,"(Rose tries to use the controls, but the engine stops. She runs outside"
312,"into the Powell Estate, then back inside.) "
313,"ROSE: Come on, fly. How do you fly? Come on, help me! "
314,[Powell Estate]
315,
316,(Rose finally gives up and goes outside. Mickey
317,comes running down the road.) 
318,"MICKEY: I knew it! I was all the way down Clifton Parade, and I heard"
319,"the engines. I thought, there's only one thing that makes a noise like"
320,that. What is it? 
321,"(Rose hugs him, in tears.)"
322,
323,[Floor 494]
324,
325,"JACK: Rose, I've called up the internal laser"
326,codes. 
327,[Floor 500]
328,
329,JACK : There should be a different number on
330,every screen. Can you read them out to me? 
331,DOCTOR: She's not here. 
332,[Floor 494]
333,
334,JACK: Of all the times to take a leak.
335,
336,[Floor 500]
337,
338,"JACK [on viewscreen]: When she gets back, tell her"
339,to read me the codes. 
340,DOCTOR: She's not coming back. 
341,[Floor 494]
342,
343,JACK: What do you mean? Where'd she go? 
344,[Floor 500]
345,
346,DOCTOR: Just get on with your work. 
347,"JACK [on viewscreen]: You took her home, didn't you? "
348,DOCTOR: Yeah. 
349,[Floor 494]
350,
351,JACK: The Delta Wave. 
352,[Floor 500]
353,
354,JACK : Is it ever going to be ready? 
355,"EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: Tell him the truth, Doctor. There is every"
356,"possibility the Delta Wave could be complete, but no possibility of"
357,"refining it. The Delta Wave must kill every living thing in its path,"
358,with no distinction between human and Dalek. 
359,[Floor 494]
360,
361,EMPEROR : All things will die 
362,[Floor 500]
363,
364,EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: By your hand. 
365,"JACK [on viewscreen]: Doctor, the range of this transmitter covers the"
366,entire Earth. 
367,EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: You would destroy Daleks and Humans together.
368,"If I am God, the creator of all things, then what does that make you,"
369,Doctor? 
370,DOCTOR: There are colonies out there. The Human Race would survive in
371,"some shape or form, but you're the only Daleks in existence. The whole"
372,Universe is in danger 
373,[Floor 494]
374,
375,DOCTOR : If I let you live.
376,
377,[Floor 500]
378,
379,"DOCTOR: Do you see, Jack? That's the decision I've"
380,got to make for every living thing. Die as a human or live as a Dalek.
381,What would you do? 
382,JACK [on viewscreen]: You sent her home. She's safe. Keep working. 
383,[Spaceship]
384,
385,EMPEROR: But he will exterminate you! 
386,[Floor 494]
387,
388,JACK: Never doubted him. 
389,[Floor 500]
390,
391,JACK : Never will. 
392,"DOCTOR: Now, you tell me, God of all Daleks, because there's one thing"
393,"I never worked out. The words Bad Wolf, spread across time and space,"
394,"everywhere, drawing me in. How'd you manage that? "
395,EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: I did nothing. 
396,"DOCTOR: Oh, come on, there's no secrets now, your worship. "
397,[Spaceship]
398,
399,EMPEROR: They are not part of my design. This is
400,the Truth of God. (The Doctor looks up at the BadWolf Corporation sign
401,on the wall.)
402,
403,[Cafe]
404,
405,(Whole chickens turn in a rotisserie. Jackie and
406,Mickey are eating their meals out of polystyrene containers. Rose isn't
407,hungry.) 
408,"JACKIE: And it's gone up market, this place. They're doing little tubs"
409,"of coleslaw, now. It's not very nice. It tastes a bit sort of clinical."
410,
411,MICKEY: Have you tried that new pizza place down Minto Road? 
412,JACKIE: What's it selling? 
413,MICKEY: Pizza. 
414,JACKIE: That's nice. Do they deliver? 
415,MICKEY: Yeah. 
416,"JACKIE: Oh, Rose, have something to eat "
417,"ROSE: Two hundred thousand years in the future, he's dying, and there's"
418,nothing I can do. 
419,"JACKIE: Well, like you said two hundred thousand years. It's way off. "
420,"ROSE: But it's not. It's now. That fight is happening right now, and"
421,"he's fighting for us, for the whole planet, and I'm just sitting here"
422,eating chips. 
423,"JACKIE: Listen to me. God knows I have hated that man, but right now, I"
424,love him and do you know why? Because he did the right thing. He sent
425,you back to me. 
426,"ROSE: But what do I do every day, mum? What do I do? Get up, catch the"
427,"bus, go to work, come back home, eat chips and go to bed? Is that it? "
428,MICKEY: It's what the rest of us do. 
429,ROSE: But I can't! 
430,"MICKEY: Why, because you're better than us? "
431,"ROSE: No, I didn't mean that. But it was. It was a better life. And I"
432,don't mean all the travelling and seeing aliens and spaceships and
433,things. That don't matter. The Doctor showed me a better way of living
434,your life. You know he showed you too. That you don't just give up. You
435,don't just let things happen. You make a stand. You say no. You have
436,"the guts to do what's right when everyone else just runs away, and I"
437,just can't 
438,(Rose runs out of the cafe.)
439,
440,[Observation deck]
441,
442,"JACK: Right, Lynda, you are my eyes and ears. When"
443,"the Daleks get in, you can follow it on that screen and report it to"
444,me. 
445,LYNDA: Understood. 
446,JACK: They'll detect you but the door's made of Hydra Combination. It
447,should keep them out. 
448,LYNDA: Should? 
449,JACK: It's the best I can do. How long till the Fleet arrives? 
450,PAVALE: They've accelerated. 
451,"JACK: This is it, ladies and gentlemen. We are at war! "
452,(Daleks stream out of the flying saucers towards Game Station. Or
453,"Satellite Five, if you prefer.)"
454,
455,[Powell Estate]
456,
457,MICKEY: You can't spend the rest of your life
458,thinking about the Doctor. 
459,ROSE: But how do I forget him? 
460,"MICKEY: You've got to start living your own life. You know, a proper"
461,"life, like the kind he's never had. The sort of life that you could"
462,have with me. 
463,(Then Rose notices large letters painted on the tarmac of the play
464,area.) 
465,ROSE: Over here. It's over here as well! 
466,MICKEY: That's been there for years. It's just a phrase. It's just
467,words. 
468,ROSE: I thought it was a warning. Maybe it's the opposite. Maybe it's a
469,message. The same words written down now and two hundred thousand years
470,"in the future. It's a link between me and the Doctor. Bad Wolf here,"
471,Bad Wolf there. 
472,"MICKEY: But if it's a message, what's it saying? "
473,ROSE: It's telling me I can get back. The least I can do is help him
474,escape. 
475,[Floor 499]
476,
477,"JACK: Stand your ground, everyone. Follow my"
478,commands. And good luck.
479,
480,[Observation gallery]
481,
482,LYNDA: You were right. They're forcing the airlock
483,on four nine four. 
484,"(The whole satellite shakes, and the Daleks stream in.)"
485,
486,[Tardis]
487,
488,ROSE: All the Tardis needs to do is make a return
489,trip. Just reverse. 
490,"MICKEY: Yeah, but we still can't do it. "
491,ROSE: The Doctor always said the Tardis was telepathic. This thing is
492,alive. It can listen. 
493,"MICKEY: It's not listening now, is it? "
494,"ROSE: We need to get inside it. Last time I saw you, with the Slitheen,"
495,"this middle bit opened, and there was this light, and the Doctor said"
496,"it was the heart of the Tardis. If we can open it, I can make contact."
497,I can tell it what to do. 
498,MICKEY: Rose. 
499,ROSE: Mmm? 
500,"MICKEY: If you go back, you're going to die. "
501,"ROSE: That's a risk I've got to take, because there's nothing left for"
502,me here. 
503,MICKEY: Nothing? 
504,ROSE: No. 
505,"MICKEY: Okay, if that's what you think, let's get this thing open. "
506,[Observation deck]
507,
508,"JACK : Okay, activate internal lasers. Slice"
509,them up. 
510,(The Floor Manager does so.) 
511,LYNDA: Defences have gone offline. The Dalek's have overridden the lot.
512,
513,(The Floor Manager and other volunteers start shooting at the
514,approaching Daleks. The bullets are absorbed into a forcefield around
515,each Dalek.) 
516,FLOOR MANAGER: You lied to me! The bullets don't work!
517,(She gets exterminated.)
518,
519,[Tardis]
520,
521,(Mickey has fastened a heavy chain to the tow hitch
522,on his Mini. The other end is fastened to the Tardis console. He drives
523,"forward slowly, trying to pull it open.) "
524,ROSE: Faster! 
525,[Powell Estate]
526,
527,(Jackie watches as the Mini burns rubber
528,fruitlessly.) 
529,MICKEY: Come on! 
530,ROSE: It's not moving! 
531,(The chain breaks. Rose kicks the console in frustration.)
532,
533,[Observation gallery]
534,
535,LYNDA: Advance guard have made it 
536,[Floor 500]
537,
538,LYNDA : To four nine five. 
539,DOCTOR: Jack
540,
541,[Floor 499]
542,
543,DOCTOR : How're we doing? 
544,JACK: Four nine five should be good. I like four nine five. 
545,[Floor 495]
546,
547,DALEK: Identify yourself! 
548,ANNE DROID: You are the weakest link. Goodbye! 
549,(Anne vapourises three Daleks in quick succession.) 
550,[Floor 499]
551,
552,JACK: Yes!
553,
554,[Floor 495]
555,
556,ANNE DROID: You are the weakest link 
557,(The next Dalek to enter blows her head off.) 
558,ANNE DROID: Goodbye. 
559,DALEK: Proceed to next level. 
560,[Observation gallery]
561,
562,LYNDA: They're flying up the ventilation shafts.
563,"No, wait a minute. Oh, my God. Why're they doing that? They're going"
564,down. 
565,[Floor Zero]
566,
567,DALEKS : Exterminate! Exterminate! 
568,(The Daleks enter and cause panic.) 
569,DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate. 
570,RODRICK: You can't! You don't exist! It's not fair! I won the game! I
571,should be rich! I'm a winner! You can't do this to me! 
572,DALEK: Exterminate.
573,
574,[Observation gallery]
575,
576,(Lynda turns off the sound on the console.) 
577,LYNDA: Floor Zero. They killed them all. 
578,[Tardis]
579,
580,"JACKIE: It was never going to work, sweetheart. And"
581,the Doctor knew that. He just wanted you to be safe. 
582,ROSE: I can't give up. 
583,JACKIE: Lock the door. Walk away. 
584,ROSE: Dad wouldn't give up. 
585,"JACKIE: Well, he's not here, is he? And even if he was, he'd say the"
586,same. 
587,"ROSE: No, he wouldn't. He'd tell me to try anything. If I could save"
588,"the Doctor's life, try anything. "
589,"JACKIE: Well, we're never going to know. "
590,"ROSE: Well, I know because I met him. I met Dad. "
591,JACKIE: Don't be ridiculous. 
592,"ROSE: The Doctor took me back in time, and I met Dad. "
593,JACKIE: Don't say that. 
594,"ROSE: Remember when Dad died? There was someone with him. A girl, a"
595,"blonde girl. She held his hand. You saw her from a distance, Mum. You"
596,saw her! Think about it. That was me. You saw me. 
597,JACKIE: Stop it. 
598,ROSE: That's how good the Doctor is. 
599,JACKIE: Stop it! Just stop it! 
600,(Jackie runs out.)
601,
602,[Floor 500]
603,
604,DOCTOR: Lynda! What's happening on Earth? 
605,[Observation deck]
606,
607,LYNDA: The Fleet's descending. They're bombing
608,"whole continents. Europa, Pacifica, the New American Alliance."
609,Australasia's just gone. 
610,[Spaceship]
611,
612,EMPEROR: This is perfection. I have created Heaven
613,on Earth. 
614,[Floor 499]
615,
616,"JACK: Floor 499, we're the last defence. The"
617,bullets should work if you concentrate them on the Dalek's eyestalk.
618,I've got the forcefield at maximum so Dalek fire power should be at its
619,weakest. 
620,PAVALE: I'm only here because of you. I joined the Programme because
621,you were on it. 
622,"WOMAN: Am I supposed to say, when this is all over and if we're still"
623,"alive, maybe we could go for a drink? "
624,PAVALE: That'd be nice. 
625,"WOMAN: Yeah, well, tough. "
626,(But she gives him a wink and a smile.)
627,
628,[Powell Estate]
629,
630,MICKEY: There's got to be something else we can do.
631,
632,ROSE: Mum was right. Maybe we should just lock the door and walk away. 
633,"MICKEY: I'm not having that. I'm not having you just, just give up now."
634,No way. We just need something stronger than my car. Something bigger.
635,Something like that. 
636,(A big yellow recovery truck comes round the corner and stops by the
637,Tardis. Jackie was driving.) 
638,"JACKIE: Right, you've only got this until six o'clock, so get on with"
639,it. 
640,"ROSE: Mum, where the hell did you get that from? "
641,"JACKIE: Rodrigo. He owes me a favour. Never mind why, but you were"
642,"right about your dad, sweetheart. He was full of mad ideas, and it's"
643,"exactly what he would've done. Now, get on with it before I change my"
644,mind. 
645,(Jackie throws the keys to Mickey.)
646,
647,[Floor 500]
648,
649,JACK: Open fire!
650,(The Doctor hears the gunfire and rushes to plug in a massive power
651,cable. The defenders are firing through slits in pieces of bulkhead.) 
652,PAVALE: It's not working! 
653,"JACK: Concentrate your fire! Eyestalk, two o'clock! "
654,DALEK: My vision is impaired! I cannot see! 
655,WOMAN: We did it! 
656,(And promptly gets exterminated.) 
657,PAVALE: No! No! 
658,"(Pavale shows himself, firing over the top of the barricade. Guess what"
659,happens to him.)
660,
661,[Observation gallery]
662,
663,LYNDA: I've got a problem 
664,DALEK : Human female detected. 
665,LYNDA: They've found me. 
666,[Floor 500]
667,
668,"DOCTOR: You'll be all right, Lynda. That side of"
669,the station's reinforced against meteors. 
670,[Observation gallery]
671,
672,LYNDA: Hope so! You know what they say about Earth
673,workmanship. 
674,(A Dalek with an oxy-acetylene torch instead of sink plunger starts
675,cutting through the door. Then she turns to see four Daleks rising up
676,"outside the big window. One fires, breaking the glass. Lynda screams,"
677,just once.)
678,
679,[Floor 500]
680,
681,"(Jack backs in, firing at Daleks.) "
682,"JACK: Last man standing! For God's sake, Doctor, finish that thing and"
683,kill them! 
684,EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: Finish that thing and kill mankind. 
685,[Powell Estate]
686,
687,"(Once again, Jackie watches as Rose and Mickey use"
688,a chain to try and pull the Tardis console open.) 
689,ROSE: Keep going! 
690,JACKIE: Put your foot down! 
691,ROSE: Faster! 
692,"JACKIE: Give it some more, Mickey! "
693,ROSE: Keep going! 
694,"JACKIE: Come on, come on! "
695,ROSE: Keep going! 
696,JACKIE: Give it some more! 
697,(The console burst open. Rose looks inside and golden energy streams
698,into her eyes.) 
699,MICKEY: Rose! 
700,"(The Tardis doors slam shut on him, and the Tardis dematerialises.)"
701,
702,[Floor 500]
703,
704,"JACK: Doctor, you've got twenty seconds maximum! "
705,"(The Tardis hurtles through time, all the time sending energy into"
706,Rose. 
707,Jack runs out of bullets. He throws away the machine gun and takes out
708,a pistol. Then that too is empty.) 
709,DALEK: Exterminate. 
710,JACK: I kind of figured that. 
711,(The blast throws Jack back into the lift.) 
712,DOCTOR: It's ready! 
713,(The Daleks enter from all sides.) 
714,"DOCTOR: You really want to think about this, because if I activate the"
715,"signal, every living creature dies. "
716,EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: I am immortal. 
717,DOCTOR: Do you want to put that to the test? 
718,EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: I want to see you become like me. Hail the
719,"Doctor, the Great Exterminator. "
720,DOCTOR: I'll do it! 
721,"EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: Then prove yourself, Doctor. What are you,"
722,coward or killer? 
723,(But he cannot throw the final switch.) 
724,DOCTOR: Coward. Any day. 
725,EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: Mankind will be harvested because of your
726,weakness. 
727,DOCTOR: And what about me? Am I becoming one of your angels? 
728,EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: You are the heathen. You will be exterminated.
729,
730,DOCTOR: Maybe it's time. 
731,"(The Doctor closes his eyes, and the Tardis materialises behind him.) "
732,DALEK: Alert! Tardis materialising! 
733,EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: You will not escape! 
734,(The Tardis doors open. Rose is silhouetted in a blinding golden light.
735,Energy tendrils snake outwards.) 
736,DOCTOR: What've you done? 
737,"ROSE: I looked into the Tardis, and the Tardis looked into me. "
738,"DOCTOR: You looked into the Time Vortex. Rose, no one's meant to see"
739,that. 
740,EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: This is the Abomination! 
741,DALEK: Exterminate! 
742,(Rose stops the beam with her hand.) 
743,"ROSE: I am the Bad Wolf. I create myself. I take the words, I scatter"
744,them in time and space. A message to lead myself here. 
745,"DOCTOR: Rose, you've got to stop this. You've got to stop this now."
746,You've got the entire vortex running through your head. You're going to
747,burn. 
748,ROSE: I want you safe. My Doctor. Protected from the false god. 
749,EMPEROR [on viewscreen]: You cannot hurt me. I am immortal. 
750,ROSE: You are tiny. I can see the whole of time and space. Every single
751,"atom of your existence, and I divide them. "
752,(A Dalek disintegrates gently.) 
753,ROSE: Everything must come to dust. All things. Everything dies. The
754,Time War ends. 
755,(The Daleks crumble.) 
756,[Spaceship]
757,
758,EMPEROR: I will not die. I cannot die! 
759,(The spaceship disappears in a golden wave.) 
760,[Floor 500]
761,
762,"DOCTOR: Rose, you've done it. Now stop. Just let"
763,go. 
764,ROSE: How can I let go of this? I bring life. 
765,(Jack breaths again.) 
766,DOCTOR: But this is wrong! You can't control life and death. 
767,"ROSE: But I can. The sun and the moon, the day and night. But why do"
768,they hurt? 
769,DOCTOR: The power's going to kill you and it's my fault. 
770,"ROSE: I can see everything. All that is, all that was, all that ever"
771,could be. 
772,DOCTOR: That's what I see. All the time. And doesn't it drive you mad? 
773,ROSE: My head. 
774,DOCTOR: Come here. 
775,ROSE: It's killing me 
776,DOCTOR: I think you need a Doctor. 
777,(The Doctor kisses Rose. The golden energy transfers from her eyes to
778,"his, then she faints in his arms. The Doctor exhales the energy back"
779,into the Tardis and its doors close. 
780,"Jack picks up a handful of Dalek dust from the floor, then runs when he"
781,hears the Tardis engines. He's too late. It
782,"dematerialises, leaving him stranded.)"
783,
784,[Tardis]
785,
786,ROSE: What happened? 
787,DOCTOR: Don't you remember? 
788,ROSE: It's like there was this singing. 
789,DOCTOR: That's right. I sang a song and the Daleks ran away. 
790,"ROSE: I was at home. No, I wasn't, I was in the Tardis, and there was"
791,this light. I can't remember anything else 
792,(The Doctor's skin is darkening.) 
793,DOCTOR: Rose Tyler. I was going take you to so many places. Barcelona.
794,"Not the city Barcelona, the planet Barcelona. You'd love it. Fantastic"
795,place. They've got dogs with no noses. Imagine how many times a day you
796,"end up telling that joke, and it's still funny. "
797,"ROSE: Then, why can't we go? "
798,"DOCTOR: Maybe you will, and maybe I will. But not like this. "
799,ROSE: You're not making sense. 
800,"DOCTOR: I might never make sense again. I might have two heads, or no"
801,head. Imagine me with no head. And don't say that's an improvement. But
802,"it's a bit dodgy, this process. You never know what you're going to end"
803,up with 
804,(The Doctor double over in pain.) 
805,ROSE: Doctor! 
806,DOCTOR: Stay away! 
807,"ROSE: Doctor, tell me what's going on. "
808,"DOCTOR: I absorbed all the energy of the Time Vortex, and no one's"
809,meant to do that. Every cell in my body's dying. 
810,ROSE: Can't you do something? 
811,"DOCTOR: Yeah, I'm doing it now. Time Lords have this little trick, it's"
812,"sort of a way of cheating death. Except it means I'm going to change,"
813,and I'm not going to see you again. Not like this. Not with this daft
814,old face. And before I go 
815,ROSE: Don't say that. 
816,"DOCTOR: Rose, before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic."
817,Absolutely fantastic. And do you know what? So was I. 
818,(Golden light burst out of the Doctor's body. This is not a nice quiet
819,regeneration of the usual kind. Everything changes very suddenly and
820,the tenth Doctor is standing there. Everyone say Hi! to  David Tennant using
821,a
822,South London accent instead of his natural Scottish burr.) 
823,"DOCTOR: Hello. Okay. Ooo, new teeth. That's weird. So, where was I? Oh,"
824,that's right. Barcelona.
