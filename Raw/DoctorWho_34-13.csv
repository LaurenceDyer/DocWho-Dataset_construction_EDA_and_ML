18, [Clara's
19,bedroom]
20,
21,(It is the day before Christmas in Clara's new
22,"home, with staircase and front door. All the decorations are up and"
23,that very rare meteorological event for London - snow in December -
24,can be seen through
25,the windows. A crash and a sudden heavy fall of snow past the bedroom
26,window wakes Clara.) 
27,SANTA : Argh! (Bells jingle) Moron! Numbskull! Elf! 
28,IAN : That's racist! 
29,"SANTA : Of course it's not racist, you are an elf. "
30,"(Clara gets out of bed, puts on a dressing gown and opens the door onto"
31,"the flat roof between three sides of the roof, and which has a skylight"
32,in the middle. She has the only entrance to it from her attic bedroom.
33,There are wrapped presents and small orange fruit scattered all around.
34,Three figures are looking at a sleigh standing on its
35,end against the -) 
36,[Clara's roof]
37,
38,SANTA: Chimneys? 
39,IAN: I'm sorry! 
40,SANTA: I'm just checking that you can see these massive chimneys. 
41,"IAN: I, er, they, they're hard to miss. "
42,"SANTA: Well, as you've clearly demonstrated, Ian. "
43,"WOLF: Donner! Donner and Blitzen. Come on down. Down here, boys. "
44,"(There are three members of species Rangifer tarandus flying around,"
45,"bells jingling on their harness, and one has a glowing red nose. This is, of course, impossible.) "
46,"WOLF: Good boys, good boys. Good boy. Rudolph? "
47,"SANTA: Just, just clear all the tangerines up. Pick 'em up. All of"
48,"them, Ian. "
49,"IAN: You know no one really likes the tangerines, don't you? "
50,(We now see that this is Dan Starkey out from under the Strax makeup.) 
51,SANTA: How dare you! That's my signature gift. That and the walnut. 
52,"WOLF: Down here, boys, come on. Come. Rudolph? "
53,(Wolf the elf kindly has his name embroidered on the back of his
54,jacket. Ian looks up from gathering tangerines.) 
55,"IAN: Er, sir? We've been seen. "
56,SANTA: Hello. 
57,CLARA: Hello. 
58,"WOLF: Hello, ha ha! "
59,"IAN: Hello, human. "
60,WOLF: You can't call her human. 
61,IAN: It's not racist. They don't mind. 
62,"SANTA: Hush up, both of you. Oh, sorry about this, girl. We are just"
63,"three passing, perfectly ordinary roof people, doing some emergency"
64,"roof things. Carry on. Merry Christmas. If, if it is Christmas, I mean."
65,"Heh, heh. I don't much care for things like that, myself. Pfft. I mean,"
66,Christmas. (laughs)
67,
68,CLARA: Are you Santa Claus? 
69,"SANTA: Me? No. Oh, no. It's ridiculous. Heh, heh. No, no, no. "
70,(But then Clara sees the reindeer fly past behind him.) 
71,WOLF: Rudolph! Rudolph!
72,Down here now! 
73,"SANTA: All right, fine, yes. Yes, it's me. Ha! Guilty. How did you"
74,recognise me? 
75,WOLF: You know how you grew that beard as a bit of a disguise? People
76,have picked up on it. 
77,"CLARA: Okay. No. Hang on. Stop. Shut up. What? Seriously, you, you're"
78,Father Christmas. You're real. 
79,SANTA: Of course I'm real. 
80,WOLF: How could he not be real? 
81,SANTA: Huh? How do you think those presents got under the tree every
82,year? By magic? 
83,"CLARA: Well, I thought it was my mum and "
84,IAN + WOLF: Mum and Dad? 
85,"SANTA: Ho, ho! "
86,"IAN: Well, of course it was."
87,
88,"WOLF: I mean, it makes perfect sense. "
89,"IAN: Yeah, your mum and dad, one day a year, for no particular reason,"
90,"just out of the blue, suddenly decide to give you a great, big pile of"
91,presents. 
92,(So no one there knows about the tradition of gift giving on Dec
93,"25th, and that Santa Claus is really Sinterklass which is Dutch for"
94,"Saint Nicholas who had a reputation for secret gift giving, and whose day"
95,is 7th Dec. Tut. What is modern education coming to?)
96,"WOLF: No, no, no. Because they love you so much. It's a lovely story,"
97,dear. 
98,"IAN: Yeah, but it's time to start living in the real world, yeah? "
99,(Santa has got his notebook out.) 
100,"SANTA: Okay. Right. Clara Oswald. Mostly favours travel books, science"
101,"kits, strict ban on hair products. Marginal for the naughty list, '93."
102,"Tut, tut, tut. Believer until the age of nine. Why did you stop? "
103,CLARA: Because you're a fairy tale. I grew out of fairy tales. 
104,"SANTA: (sighs) Did you, Clara? Did you really? "
105,(The Tardis materialises next to Clara's roof door.) 
106,"DOCTOR: Clara, I want you to step inside the Tardis. I don't want you"
107,"to talk, I want you to do as I ask. Please. "
108,"IAN: That was good, with the box. "
109,WOLF: Hmph. Not often we get upstaged on a rooftop. Hmm. 
110,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm really here. I'm back. Now get inside the Tardis. "
111,(Clara obeys silently and shuts the door.) 
112,"DOCTOR: I know what this is. I know what's happening, and I know what's"
113,at stake. 
114,"SANTA: I don't think you do, Doctor. But I promise, before this"
115,"Christmas Day is done, you will be glad of my help. "
116,DOCTOR: Happy Easter. 
117,(He goes into the Tardis.) 
118,"WOLF: Ooh, brutal! "
119,"IAN: Cool exit line, though. "
120,"SANTA: Be sure to save some room for a tangerine, Doctor. "
121,DOCTOR: Nobody likes the tangerines.
122,
123,[Tardis]
124,
125,"CLARA: I'm really back here. This is, this is real,"
126,yeah? 
127,(The Doctor starts setting coordinates.)
128,
129,CLARA: Doctor? Talk to me. I never thought I was going to see you
130,again. What is going on out there? What's happening? 
131,(The time rotor starts spinning overhead.) 
132,"CLARA: Oh, that noise. Never knew how much I loved it. "
133,"DOCTOR: There's something you have to ask yourself, and it's important."
134,Your life may depend on it. Everybody's life. Do you really believe in
135,Santa Claus? 
136,"CLARA: Do you know what? Yeah. Right now, here, I think I do."
137,
138,[Corridor]
139,
140,(On a massive
141,"icesheet, with green aurora borealis"
142,"shimmering on the horizon, is a cluster of huts and vehicles with"
143,"caterpillar tracks, and a satellite dish. Inside, a young woman is"
144,wearing a headset with a mini-cam and looking very nervous. A woman
145,speaks to her through her earpiece.) 
146,"ASHLEY : You are now twenty feet from the infirmary. In a moment,"
147,as
148,soon as you're ready
149,
150,[Control room]
151,
152,"(They have her on a monitor, and are recording the"
153,"feed. The place is full of screens and illuminated keyboards, also dangling"
154,light bulbs and some easy chairs.) 
155,ASHLEY: We'll disable the security protocols. 
156,(An older Scots woman speaks.) 
157,BELLOWS: Your neural link is good and holding. We stand ready to abort
158,and extract at the first sign of an anomaly. 
159,"(The man in charge - Michael Troughton, son of the second Doctor,"
160,"Patrick, speaks.) "
161,ALBERT: We're going to be with you
162,
163,[Corridor]
164,
165,"ALBERT : Every step of the way, Shona. "
166,ASHLEY : We're all depending on you
167,
168,[Control room]
169,
170,"ASHLEY: And we know you won't let us down. Shona,"
171,I'm opening the door. 
172,(Auto door lock system 036-8514//412 DR07 PURGE.)
173,
174,[Corridor]
175,
176,SHONA: I need the toilet!
177,
178,[Control room]
179,
180,"BELLOWS: No, you don't. We're monitoring your"
181,bodily functions. 
182,SHONA : And how are you monitoring that? Cos
183,that's rude!
184,
185,[Corridor]
186,
187,SHONA: That is perverted.
188,
189,[Control room]
190,
191,"ALBERT: Do you remember my briefing, Shona?"
192,
193,[Corridor]
194,
195,"SHONA: Yeah. Well, no. I remember some of it."
196,
197,[Control room]
198,
199,ASHLEY: Some of it? 
200,BELLOWS: How much? 
201,[Corridor]
202,
203,SHONA: Till he put his hand on my knee.
204,
205,[Control room]
206,
207,SHONA : And then I was just grossing. 
208,ALBERT: It was intended as a comfort. 
209,BELLOWS: For whom? 
210,"SHONA : All I could see was his nose, with all the little hairs"
211,coming out of it.
212,
213,[Corridor]
214,
215,SHONA: Have you seen those? It's like he's got
216,"insects trapped up there, all trying to escape with their wee, wiggly"
217,legs.
218,
219,[Control room]
220,
221,ASHLEY: Okay. Let's just go through this again.
222,
223,[Corridor]
224,
225,ASHLEY : There are four sleepers inside the
226,"infirmary. You're fine, so long as they don't wake up. "
227,BELLOWS : She's in range. 
228,[Control room]
229,
230,"ASHLEY: Shona, I'm unsealing the infirmary."
231,
232,[Corridor]
233,
234,"ASHLEY : From now on, everything you think and"
235,"feel, everything you see, will be available to them."
236,
237,[Control room]
238,
239,"ASHLEY: Most of it's fine, like traffic noise when"
240,"you're sleeping, so long as you don't think about them."
241,
242,[Corridor]
243,
244,ASHLEY : So long as you don't look at them. So
245,don't think about them
246,
247,[Control room]
248,
249,ASHLEY: Don't look at them.
250,
251,[Infirmary]
252,
253,(Beep and the doors slide open. There are figures
254,on the beds covered in sheets.) 
255,SHONA: I thought there was going to be music. 
256,BELLOWS : We've got your playlist
257,
258,[Control room]
259,
260,BELLOWS: Ready to go. 
261,"ASHLEY: Focus on the words of the song, try to remember what comes"
262,next.
263,
264,[Infirmary]
265,
266,ASHLEY : That will work like interference. 
267,BELLOWS : Here comes your earworm. 
268,"(That perennial favourite earworm, Merry Christmas Everybody by Slade,"
269,starts playing.) 
270,[Control room]
271,
272,ASHLEY: Keep your eyes on the floor.
273,
274,[Infirmary]
275,
276,"ASHLEY : Shut them, where possible. "
277,SLADE: Are you hanging up your stockings on the wall?
278,
279,[Control room]
280,
281,ASHLEY: Focus on the music and move forward through
282,the infirmary. 
283,(Shona closes her eyes and moves to the beat.) 
284,SLADE: It's the time that every Santa has a ball. Does he ride a
285,red-nosed reindeer? 
286,(Shona hums and goes into a dance.) 
287,SLADE: Does a ton-up on his sleigh? 
288,SLADE + SHONA: Do the fairies keep him sober for the day? 
289,"BELLOWS: Oh, dear Lord, she's not actually "
290,"ASHLEY: If dancing works, it works. "
291,ALBERT: This is insane.
292,
293,[Infirmary]
294,
295,"SLADE + SHONA: So here it is, Merry Christmas,"
296,everybody's having fun.
297,
298,[Control room]
299,
300,ASHLEY: This is working.
301,
302,[Infirmary]
303,
304,"SLADE + SHONA: Look to the future now, It's only"
305,just begun. Are you waiting for the family to arrive? Are you sure
306,you've got the room to spare inside? 
307,(Warning Exterior door. Low temperature past this point. 01-180-2. The
308,"locking wheel starts to turn, then it opens. Shona, who is on her"
309,"knees playing air guitar, screams.) "
310,
311,[Control room]
312,
313,"ASHLEY: Shona? Shona, what's wrong?"
314,
315,[Infirmary]
316,
317,"SHONA: We've, we've got ghosts! "
318,ASHLEY : Ghosts? 
319,"SHONA: Yeah, yeah. It's a skeleton man and a girl in a nightie. "
320,(The Doctor and Clara enter. Clara has sensibly gained a parka and
321,sheepskin booties. The door closes behind them.) 
322,
323,[Control room]
324,
325,(They look at the figures on the beds.) 
326,CLARA : Doctor?
327,
328,"SHONA : No, no, no, you're making me think about them."
329,
330,[Infirmary]
331,
332,SHONA: Don't make me think about them! 
333,CLARA: What are they? 
334,(The figures start to sit up slowly.) 
335,"SHONA: Look. Just don't ask, yeah? And don't look. Don't make me think"
336,about them. 
337,(The sheets fall from their faces to reveal blank slimy carapaces. The
338,Doctor scans them with his screwdriver as they get out of bed.) 
339,DOCTOR: Deaf. Blind. How can they see us? How do they even know that
340,we're here? 
341,"SHONA: They can only see you, yeah, if you see them. So just, so just"
342,"don't look, don't even think about them. "
343,"DOCTOR: Oh, telepathic. They can home in on their own image in someone"
344,else's brain. Third-party perception. Mind piracy. We're being hacked. 
345,CLARA: What does that even mean? 
346,(The Sleepers are all standing.) 
347,DOCTOR: The visual input from your optic nerve is being streamed to
348,their brains. Stop broadcasting. Close your eyes. 
349,(Clara obeys. The images of the alien heads stretch and morph.) 
350,"CLARA: They're still coming, aren't they? "
351,DOCTOR: It's because you're still thinking about them. So long as you
352,"retain them as an active memory, they can still home in. Think about"
353,something else. 
354,CLARA: How? 
355,"SHONA: (sings) So here it is, Merry Christmas "
356,CLARA: Why is she singing? 
357,SHONA: Everybody's having fun 
358,DOCTOR: (sotto) She's running interference. She's trying to distract
359,herself. Three hundred and four minus seventeen. 
360,"CLARA: Sorry, what? "
361,DOCTOR: Plus twenty. Just do it! 
362,CLARA: Five hundred and seven. 
363,"(Ooo, 200 out! Should started with 504,"
364,then.) 
365,(A
366,crack like a mucus filled maw open in the carapaces.) 
367,"DOCTOR: Minus fourteen, times four. "
368,CLARA: One thousand nine hundred and seventy two. 
369,DOCTOR: Stop being so good at arithmetic. 
370,CLARA: I can't help it! 
371,DOCTOR: Danny Pink! What is Danny Pink up to right now? He's probably
372,flirting with your neighbour or texting women of low moral character. 
373,"(After seeing Danny in her mind, Clara opens her eyes and slaps the"
374,"Doctor's face, hard. The Sleepers,"
375,"who are now very close to them, close their maws.) "
376,CLARA: (sotto) Don't you dare. Don't you dare say that. 
377,DOCTOR: I was only 
378,CLARA: Danny Pink is dead. 
379,(The Sleepers growl.) 
380,"DOCTOR: No, he's not. "
381,CLARA: He's dead. 
382,"(The infirmary door opens and the rest of the crew run in with very,"
383,very big guns.) 
384,"ASHLEY: Go, run, now, now, now! "
385,(The Doctor turns to grab Shona.) 
386,"DOCTOR: Come on, quick, quick, quick, come on! "
387,(Something like a glutenous spider drops down on a thread of mucus from
388,the ceiling.) 
389,ALBERT: Here they come! 
390,(Then lots of them.) 
391,DOCTOR: No! 
392,"(One heads squarely for the Doctor's face. Cut to exterior, and a big"
393,"explosion which destroys the exterior door. A tangerine rolls in from the snow, followed by a troop of"
394,"varicoloured slinkies and toy robots. Rudolph rears up, with Santa on"
395,"his back, viewed through the hole where the exterior door used to be."
396,Santa dismounts.) 
397,"SANTA: Whoa, whoa! Ah! Good boy. "
398,"(He walks into the infirmary, followed by Ian with a balloon toy, and"
399,Wolf with an air gun.) 
400,"SANTA: Well, now. What seems to be the problem? This is the North Pole."
401,We don't want any trouble here. 
402,(Rudolph bellows.) 
403,"SANTA: Hey, Rudolph. "
404,(Santa uses his car key fob to 'lock' Rudolph. Beep!) 
405,"SANTA: Easy, son. Oi! Sleepy heads! It's Christmas Eve, early to bed. "
406,(Santa claps his hands and the Sleepers return to their beds.) 
407,ASHLEY: Who the hell are you? 
408,"DOCTOR: Oh, take a guess. Go on, push the boat out. Tooth Fairy, maybe?"
409,Easter Bunny? 
410,"IAN: Shut your mouth, wise guy, or you get yours. "
411,WOLF: It's a balloon animal. 
412,IAN: That's a toy gun. 
413,"WOLF: Yeah, well, at least it's unsuitable for children under four."
414,"Parts small enough to swallow, so watch out. "
415,(Santa sighs.) 
416,"SHONA: Now, this is ridiculous. Am I, am I dreaming? "
417,"DOCTOR: Oh, very good. "
418,"ASHLEY: I need to know exactly who you are, and what's happening here. "
419,(Santa gently points her gun away from his midriff.) 
420,"SANTA: Hello, Ashley. Lead scientist on a polar expedition. Oh, that"
421,"microscope really paid off, didn't it? Now, your mum and dad"
422,"wanted me to get you a toy one, but sometimes, I take a chance. "
423,ASHLEY: Who are you? Why are you dressed like that? 
424,SANTA: Why do you think? 
425,"SHONA: Come on, this is mental. This is totally not happening. "
426,"SANTA: I got three words, Shona. Don't make me use 'em. "
427,SHONA: What three words? 
428,SANTA: My. Little. Pony. 
429,"SHONA: Shut up, you. "
430,"SANTA: Yeah? I've got lots more, babe. "
431,"SHONA: I will mark you, Santa. "
432,(Shona makes claws of her hands.) 
433,"CLARA: Okay, Doctor, are you going to explain? What is going on? "
434,"SANTA: It's an invasion, Miss Oswald. "
435,"CLARA: An invasion of, of what, elves? "
436,WOLF: Whoa! That is racist. 
437,IAN: Elfist! 
438,"WOLF: Yeah. Which is a bit hypocritical, from someone of your height. "
439,(Wolf is ever so slightly taller than Clara. Santa fetches a large
440,transparent specimen container 16367//KB from his saddlebags.) 
441,"SANTA: Huh? You seen them before, Doctor? "
442,DOCTOR: I've heard of them. 
443,SANTA: The Kantrofarri. 
444,DOCTOR: Colloquially known as the Dream Crabs. 
445,"SANTA: Yeah. Depending on how many of those are already on Earth, the"
446,"human race may well have seen its last day. So, are we going to stand"
447,"about arguing about whether I'm real or not, or are we going to get"
448,busy saving Christmas? 
449,"IAN: Oh, ho, ho! Santa goes badass! "
450,WOLF: He's giving me the feels. 
451,"SANTA: Shut up. That's a, that's a verbal warning. Please, stop it."
452,
453,[Laboratory]
454,
455,CLARA: Is it dead? 
456,(The Doctor and Ashley are looking at the Dream Crab in the container.) 
457,DOCTOR: I don't know. Possibly. 
458,ASHLEY: I'm assuming extra-terrestrial. 
459,"DOCTOR: Oh, definitely. "
460,ASHLEY: Then how can you have heard of these things? 
461,DOCTOR: Guess. 
462,"ASHLEY: Because you're extra-terrestrial, too. "
463,DOCTOR: Do you believe that? 
464,[Control room]
465,
466,(Shona is interviewing the three newcomers in an
467,alcove. Santa has got a mug of drink. Ian is flicking through his smart
468,phone.) 
469,SHONA: If you are Santa 
470,SANTA: Mmm hmm. 
471,SHONA: What are you doing here? 
472,SANTA: It's the North Pole. And I own it. 
473,IAN: He means the actual pole. 
474,WOLF: It goes right through the middle of the workshop. 
475,IAN: I've got a selfie with it. 
476,WOLF: Show her. Look at Ian. 
477,(Ian holds out the phone with the photo on it.) 
478,SHONA: The North Pole isn't an actual pole. 
479,IAN: Course it is. Look. 
480,"SHONA: If it was an actual pole, it would not be stripy. "
481,WOLF: It's got to be stripy. 
482,"IAN: Otherwise, you couldn't see it moving round. "
483,WOLF: Mmm. It's actually basic physics. 
484,[Laboratory]
485,
486,"ASHLEY: Why's it called a Dream Crab, for a start? "
487,DOCTOR: Theorise. 
488,ASHLEY: Because it generates a telepathic field. 
489,DOCTOR: And? 
490,ASHLEY: Alters perception. 
491,DOCTOR: Meaning? 
492,ASHLEY: I seem to be doing all the work here. 
493,CLARA: Meaning we can't trust anything that we see or hear. 
494,DOCTOR: Go to the window. 
495,ASHLEY: Why? 
496,DOCTOR: Because it gets worse. 
497,(Ashley looks out at an incongruous blue Police [public call] Box.) 
498,ASHLEY: What is that? 
499,DOCTOR: That's how Clara and I got here. 
500,ASHLEY: In a box? 
501,"DOCTOR: Technically, in a telephone kiosk. "
502,ASHLEY: (laughs) How? 
503,DOCTOR: Because it's a spaceship in disguise. You know what the big
504,problem is in telling fantasy and reality apart? 
505,ASHLEY: What? 
506,DOCTOR: They're both ridiculous. [Control room]SHONA: It's Christmas Eve! 
507,SANTA: Yeah. You don't have to tell me that. 
508,"SHONA: Yeah, well, then why aren't you out delivering presents? "
509,"SANTA: Technically, I am. "
510,"SHONA: Well, you're not. You're stood right there. "
511,"SANTA: Oh, Shona, grow up, love. "
512,"IAN: Yeah, do the math, baby."
513,(Shona takes notes.)
514,SANTA: There's not just one Santa delivery team. How could there be?
515,There are five hundred and twenty six million four hundred and three
516,thousand and twelve children all expecting presents before tomorrow
517,"morning. So, hmm, that's twenty two million children per hour. It's"
518,impossible!
519,"Obviously, I've got a second sledge. [Laboratory]CLARA: So we don't know what is real and what isn't? "
520,DOCTOR: Exactly. 
521,CLARA: Are we in danger? 
522,"DOCTOR: Oh, we are well way past danger, Clara. If I'm right, and I"
523,"usually am, we're dying. "
524,ASHLEY: Then how do we stay alive? 
525,DOCTOR: I like you. Straight to the point. I want you to show me how
526,"you first encountered those creatures, and what happened to those"
527,"people in the infirmary. I notice you all wear mini-cams, so I assume"
528,that there is footage. 
529,ASHLEY: Is it possible I'm about to work with someone who might be a
530,dream? 
531,"DOCTOR: If it helps, so am I. "
532,ASHLEY: We have footage on the drives. I'll see what I can pull up. 
533,"DOCTOR: Ashley, what's this polar base for? Why are you all here? "
534,ASHLEY: It's a long story. 
535,(Ashley leaves.) 
536,CLARA: What you said about Danny. Unacceptable. 
537,DOCTOR: I know. I had to flood your mind with random emotion. 
538,CLARA: Random? 
539,DOCTOR: You never told me he was dead. You said he made it back. 
540,"CLARA: Well, I lied. I lied, so you'd go home to Gallifrey instead of"
541,fussing about me. 
542,"DOCTOR: I never found Gallifrey. I lied, so you'd stay with Danny. "
543,"CLARA: So we're dying, then? "
544,DOCTOR: Yes. 
545,CLARA: Why? 
546,"DOCTOR: Oh, complicated. "
547,CLARA: How long do we have? 
548,DOCTOR: No idea. 
549,"CLARA: Just. Doctor, give me something to do. "
550,"DOCTOR: Trust nothing. Accept nothing you see. Whatever happens,"
551,interrogate everything. 
552,CLARA: In case it's a lie. 
553,DOCTOR: In case it's a lie. 
554,[Control room]
555,
556,SHONA: Reindeer can't fly. They just can't. 
557,"SANTA: No. No, they can't. It's a scientific impossibility. That is why"
558,I feed mine magic carrots. 
559,DOCTOR: You all right? 
560,"SHONA: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm trying to talk sense into er,"
561,Beardy-Weirdy. 
562,DOCTOR: You don't seem much like a scientist. 
563,"SHONA: That's a bit rude, coming from a magician. "
564,DOCTOR: Why are you out here? What brought you to the North Pole? 
565,"SHONA: Long story, isn't it? "
566,DOCTOR: You missed the killer question. 
567,"SHONA: Sorry, what? "
568,DOCTOR: Beardy-Weirdy. 
569,SANTA: Yeah? 
570,DOCTOR: How do you get all the presents in the sleigh? 
571,SANTA: It's bigger on the inside. WOLF: Ooh! 
572,ASHLEY: Doctor? 
573,(Professor Albert is gnawing on a turkey drumstick.) 
574,ALBERT: Sorry. Starving. 
575,DOCTOR: What am I looking at? 
576,(The monitor says Headcam: Carter.) 
577,BELLOWS: Footage from a week ago. A side expedition from our main
578,mission. 
579,DOCTOR: What is your main mission? 
580,"BELLOWS: Long story. Ice cave directly beneath this base. Now, look at"
581,what we found. 
582,(A cluster of Dream crabs hanging amongst icicles.) 
583,BELLOWS: Dormant at first. 
584,DOCTOR: Until you looked at them too long. Till you thought about them.
585,
586,BELLOWS: Exactly. 
587,DOCTOR: Sleeping. Probably been down there for centuries. 
588,(Anyone else thinking The Thing meets Alien?) 
589,CLARA: And it wakes up when you think about it? 
590,(The Dream Crab twitches in its container.) 
591,DOCTOR: They can detect their own mental picture in any nearby mind. 
592,ASHLEY: That's Bellows' theory. 
593,BELLOWS: It's like it responds to the presence of any data concerning
594,itself. 
595,"DOCTOR: Oh. That was always the legend. You think about a Dream Crab, a"
596,Dream Crab is coming for you. 
597,"(The Dream Crab twitches the container off the table, and it breaks.) "
598,ALBERT: This is where it gets really nasty. 
599,CLARA: Only now? 
600,(A Dream Crab descends onto the headcam and it goes into static.) 
601,"DOCTOR: Okay, then what? "
602,"(Bellows switches the image to the infirmary, with them putting the"
603,Sleepers into bed. Albert's drumstick is a never-ending feast.) 
604,"ALBERT: They're a bit like Facehuggers, aren't they? "
605,DOCTOR: Face huggers? 
606,"ALBERT: You know, Alien. The horror movie, Alien. "
607,DOCTOR: There's a horror movie called Alien? That's really offensive.
608,No wonder everyone keeps invading you. 
609,"BELLOWS: First, they just slept. Couple of days, just lying there. "
610,DOCTOR: And then they became aggressive. 
611,"ASHLEY: If we got close enough, yeah. "
612,DOCTOR: It would take the Dream Crab a little while to take control.
613,Depends how much of the host brain was 
614,ASHLEY: Was what? 
615,DOCTOR: Digested. 
616,ASHLEY: Are they still alive under those things? 
617,DOCTOR: Depends what you call alive. 
618,ASHLEY: Are they suffering? 
619,"DOCTOR: No. No, no. no, no, no. The Dream Crab induces a dream state."
620,"Keeps you happy and relaxed, in a perfectly realised dream world, as"
621,"you dissolve. Merciful, I suppose. "
622,ALBERT: Compared to what? 
623,DOCTOR: Compared to that turkey leg you keep eating. Could you rewind
624,"for me? I'd like to see them dormant again. Clara, could you fetch me"
625,the dead one? 
626,CLARA: Maybe I could fetch you a cup of tea while I'm at it. 
627,"DOCTOR: Ooh. Yes, and a punch in the face, too. "
628,CLARA: My very next suggestion. 
629,DOCTOR: Fair enough.

633,CLARA: Doctor?

635,look at it closely. The Dream Crab descends from the ceiling. Clara gasps.)

638,ASHLEY: What's wrong? 
639,DOCTOR: We're thinking about it. Clara! 
640,[Laboratory]
641,
642,CLARA: One hundred minus forty two is three
643,hundred and fifty eight times three is one thousand seven hundred and
644,seventy four minus thirty two
645,"is one hundred and forty two divided by seven is twenty and, and, and"
646,a bit. Think about something
647,"else. Think about something else. Danny Pink, Danny, Danny. Danny Pink,"
648,I love you. 
649,(The Crab is visible through the slats of the table.) 
650,"CLARA: And I'll never see you again, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry I lied. I"
651,"am sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry "
652,"(Mucus falls in a long stream in front of her face, and she screams, then stupidly turns around to look upwards."

661,"DANNY: What do you mean, who am I? Who do you think I am? "

665,CLARA: Come on where? 
666,DANNY: Downstairs. 
667,CLARA: Why? 
668,"DANNY: Well, you know what day it is. "
669,CLARA: What day is it? 
670,"DANNY: Easter. It's Easter Day. That's why I'm dressed like this, I'm"
671,Father Easter. 
672,CLARA: Is that a thing? 
673,DANNY: No. Because it's Christmas! 
674,"CLARA: Oh. Well, you've made me want chocolate now. "
675,"DANNY: Good. Come on. You, out of bed. Downstairs. I have surprises. "
676,CLARA: Tickets for the Indian Orient Express. That painting we saw in
677,"Paris, and permission to own a cat. "
678,DANNY: How did you know? 
679,"CLARA: Because those are exactly the things I want, and you are too"
680,clever ever to be wrong. 
681,DANNY: How do you make you clever into me being clever? 
682,CLARA: I always protect your ego from the truth. 
683,"DANNY: Oh, er, thank you for that. "
684,CLARA: It's Christmas. 
685,"DANNY: Hurry up, then! [Top landing](She goes out onto the spacious top landing, turns and sees a"
686,blackboard with CLARA!! written on it. Danny is halfway down the stairs
687,already.) 
688,CLARA: Danny? Whose blackboard is that? 
689,DANNY: What blackboard? Are you coming? 
690,"CLARA: Yeah, just a moment! "
691,(She turns away for an instant and when she turns back the word has
692,changed to DREAMING!!) 
693,DANNY: Clara. 
694,CLARA: Coming! 
695,"(She picks up the blackboard eraser and wipes over the word, turning it"
696,to DYING!!) 
697,DANNY: Clara! 
698,CLARA: Yeah. Just a minute. 
699,(She tries rubbing it out again. The word transforms to YOU then ARE then DYING! )DOCTOR : You are dying. (Now the whole landing
700,is lined with blackboards with the word DYING! written on them. The
701,Doctor's voice echoes from a distance.)
702,DOCTOR : Dying! Dying! Clara! Clara! Clara! 
703,(She closes her eyes and the scene returns to bright and pleasant.) 
704,"DANNY: Well, come on then. You don't know what I'm wearing underneath"
705,this Santa outfit. 
706,CLARA: Your pyjamas. You're too shy to wear less than two layers. 
707,DANNY: You could have used your imagination. 
708,"CLARA: Yeah, I don't really have to. "
709,"(There is now a blackboard at the top of the stairs behind her, saying"
710,CLARA!!)

712,DOCTOR : Clara!

716,(The Doctor is holding Clara's hand. She is lying
717,on the floor with a Crab over her face.) 
718,"DOCTOR: Clara, you're dreaming. You're dying. Can you hear me? Clara? "
719,ASHLEY: We did try to waken the others. No stimulus worked. 
720,"DOCTOR: Okay, we kill it. We find a way to kill it and we get it off of"
721,her. How do we kill it? 
722,"ASHLEY: There's no way to kill it without killing your friend, too. And"
723,"as a scientist, may I just say, I don't like the way you're talking. "
724,"DOCTOR: Santa. In the infirmary, you told the Sleepers to go to bed,"
725,and they obeyed you. 
726,"SANTA: Sorry, doesn't mean I can get that creature off her. "
727,"DOCTOR: No, but you can get back in there unharmed. "
728,SHONA: What? You're asking Santa for help? He doesn't exist. 
729,DOCTOR: And how would you know that? How did you become an expert on
730,what does and doesn't exist? 
731,SANTA: I can commit several million housebreaks in one night dressed in
732,"a red suit with jingle bells, so of course I can get back into the"
733,infirmary. 
734,DOCTOR: Good. Because there is only one way that I can communicate with
735,Clara.

741,on the front door which interrupts a kiss.) 
742,DANNY: Your dad? 
743,"CLARA: Going by the timing, I'd say so. "
744,DANNY: Mmm. 
745,"CLARA: If you let him anywhere near the subject of golf, I will do a"
746,"thing, and it will not be a good thing. "
747,"DANNY: Um, aren't we giving him golf clubs? "
748,CLARA: And I'm prepared to use them. 
749,(They both chuckle as she gets up and goes to the door.) 
750,DOCTOR: Hi. 
751,CLARA: Hi. Doctor? 
752,"DOCTOR: It's not real, Clara. You know it's not real. It's a dream, and"
753,it's killing you.

765,"there is an alien organism wrapped around your face, keeping you warm"
766,and happy while it eats you.

784,please. 
785,(The Doctor touches her right temple.) 
786,"DOCTOR: You have a pain right here. It's like an ice cream pain, but"
787,"gentle. Do you know what that is? The skin and bone have been parted,"
788,"probably half an inch, and something has pushed right into the soft"
789,tissue of your brain and is very slowly dissolving it. I want you to
790,picture it this way. Somebody has put a straw right through your skull
791,"and is drinking you. You should be screaming with agony, but there's"
792,"anaesthetic. Everything around you right now, even Danny, especially"
793,"Danny, that's the anaesthetic. "

799,DOCTOR: Because it's true. How long do you think you've been here? 
800,CLARA: All day. 
801,"DOCTOR: No. No, no, no. Barely five minutes. Because dream time goes"
802,faster. Because this isn't real. Danny isn't real. Danny Pink died
803,saving the world. 
804,DANNY: I really didn't. 
805,"DOCTOR: I'm sorry. I thought there was a way back for him, but I was"
806,wrong. I can't change that. He's dead. 
807,"DANNY: I didn't die saving the world, Doctor, I died saving Clara. The"
808,rest of you just got lucky. How long has she got? 
809,"DOCTOR: Minutes, till it's irreversible. "
810,"DANNY: Well then, get out the way. "
811,(The Doctor moves aside and Danny walks up to Clara.) 
812,"DANNY: I'm a dream and you know I am, right? (Clara nods.) Right, one"
813,thing. But it's important. It's a very important thing. That is totally
814,how you guessed all of my presents. 
815,CLARA: I miss you. 
816,DANNY: Five minutes. 
817,CLARA: What? 
818,DANNY: You can miss me for five minutes a day. And you'd better do it
819,properly. You'd better be sad. I expect my five. But all the rest of
820,"the time, Clara, all the rest of the time, every single second, you"
821,just get the hell on with it. Clear? 
822,CLARA: Don't you soldier me. 
823,DANNY: Do as you're told. 
824,DOCTOR: Brave. 
825,DANNY: Dead already. How does she wake up? 
826,"DOCTOR: I don't know. Just try. Accept this isn't real, and try. "
827,DANNY: Do it. For me. 
828,"CLARA: (crying) When I wake up, you won't be there. "
829,DANNY: Do you know why people get together at Christmas? Because every
830,"time they do, it might be the last time. Every Christmas is last"

853,"BELLOWS: It's the cold, I think. Some sort of reaction. "

858,DOCTOR: Theorise. 
859,"CLARA: Don't treat me like a beginner. I was dreaming, then I woke up."
860,I know that. 
861,DOCTOR: Do you? And have you ever woken up from a dream and discovered
862,that you're still dreaming? Dreams within dreams. Dream states nested inside
863,"each other. All perfectly possible, especially when we are dealing with"

932,"SANTA: Shona, sweetheart, I'm Santa Claus. I think you just defined me."
933,
934,DOCTOR: This makes perfect sense. The Dream Crab tries to make the
935,dream as real as possible to trap you inside it. It creates dreams
936,within dreams so you can never be sure if you are really awake. But
937,your brain knows something is wrong. Your subconscious fights back.

949,"DOCTOR: Shut up, Santa. "
950,SANTA: I have watched over you all your lives. I've taken care of you
951,from Christmas to Christmas. 
952,BELLOWS: But you're not real. 
953,"SANTA: And yet that never stopped me. All of you, come near. Come"
954,"here, come on. Join hands. "
955,"DOCTOR: Look. No. Look, we don't need all this touchy-feely stuff. "
956,"SANTA: Shut up, Doctor. Join hands. Come on, concentrate. "
957,BELLOWS: Why? 
958,"SANTA: You are deep inside this dream, all right, and it is a shared"
959,"mental state, so it is drawing power from the multi-consciousness"

961,"DOCTOR: No. No, No, no, no. Line in the sand. Santa Claus does not do the"
962,scientific explanation. 
963,"SANTA: All right. As the Doctor might say, (Scottish accent) Oh, it's"
964,all a bit dreamy-weamy. 
965,"DOCTOR: Why don't you just go and, and make a naughty list? "
966,"SANTA: I have, mate, and you're on it. "
967,"DOCTOR: Don't give me that. Look, you're supposed to be warm and friendly and"
968,cheerful.

972,"CLARA: Doctor, behave. "
973,ASHLEY: This is very sweet. But right now I have an alien life form
974,"wrapped around my face, and apparently it's digesting my brain. When"
975,"you speak, how do I know it's not the Dream Crab? "
976,"SANTA: Ooo, good question. Spoken like a scientist. "
977,CLARA: Can I put it another way? Why would the part of our brain that
978,is trying to keep all of us alive choose you for a face? 
979,SANTA: Is anyone else asking that? 
980,"SHONA: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. All of us. All of us. Why you? "
981,"SANTA: Why me? It's the North Pole, it's Christmas Day. You're dying."
982,"Who you gonna call? Just one last time, huh? One last Christmas, as if"

988,"CLARA: Shona, take his hand. "

991,"(Santa, Ian and Wolf have vanished.) "
992,BELLOWS: Where did he go?

995,"ALBERT: Well, then. What do we do? "
996,DOCTOR: That pain in your head. Make it worse. Head towards it. 
997,"ASHLEY: So when we wake up, what do we expect? "
998,DOCTOR: Only a few moments will have passed at the most. The attack is
999,still in progress. 
1000,SHONA: I'm scared. 
1001,DOCTOR: Congratulations. That means you're not an idiot.

1072,BELLOWS: It's a long (pause) story. 
1073,"CLARA: Okay, why are they all giving the same answer, because that is a"
1074,tiny bit freaky.

1120,BELLOWS: What are they doing? (The Sleepers are walking towards the cameras.)
1121,DOCTOR: It's your subconscious again. The Sleepers represent the part
1122,of your mind that's already surrendered to the attack. These are dream
1123,images of what's coming to kill you. 
1124,ALBERT: That's me? That's actually me?

1168,"you're so clever, going on and on. So tell us what to do! "
