20,Academy]
21,
22,(Night. A group of track-suited students man-handle
23,a woman out of the main building. They are followed by a slim-built
24,teenager with the voice and demeanour of a young Bill Gates.) 
25,MAN: Come on. Stop struggling. 
26,JO: You're going to regret this. Completely ridiculous. Get your hands
27,off me! 
28,"(They throw her to the ground, then toss her papers on top of her.) "
29,"RATTIGAN: I think that makes my answer clear, don't you? Oh. And, er,"
30,if you're going to
31,"go to print, spell my name right. Rattigan, with two Ts. "
32,"JO: Oh, this goes way beyond the newspapers. This thing's worldwide."
33,"I'm telling you, ATMOS is dangerous. "
34,"RATTIGAN: But if you had proof, then you wouldn't be here. "
35,"JO: Fine. If you won't listen, I'll find someone else who will. "
36,(Jo gathers up her papers and gets into her car. There is an ATMOS
37,sticker on the windscreen.)
38,
39,[Jo's car]
40,
41,(A screen lights up - welcome to your atmospheric
42,omission system.) 
43,ATMOS: Welcome. What is your destination? 
44,"JO: Shut up, you're the last thing I need. "
45,ATMOS: ATMOS cannot be disabled. 
46,"JO: Right then. Take me to UNIT Headquarters. Tower Bridge, London. "
47,ATMOS: UNIT Headquarters. 
48,[Rattigan's apartment]
49,
50,(Luke is reporting to someone via a communications
51,link in his private rooms.) 
52,RATTIGAN: Her name's Jo Nakashima. A freelance journalist. Clever by
53,"the sound of it, but not as clever as me. But that goes without saying."
54,
55,"(His room has a lot of sports stuff in it, including a surf board and"
56,squash racket.) 
57,RATTIGAN: I'd recommend termination. 
58,[Spaceship]
59,
60,"STAAL: Remember your status, boy. We do not take"
61,orders from humans.
62,
63,[Rattigan's apartment]
64,
65,"RATTIGAN: I said, recommend. "
66,STAAL : Then your advice shows military wisdom. She will be
67,terminated. 
68,RATTIGAN: Cool.
69,
70,[Jo's car]
71,
72,(Jo makes a telephone call while she is driving.) 
73,MACHINE : This is UNIT extension two two one. Please leave a
74,message after the tone. 
75,"JO: Come on, don't go through to answerphone. (beep) Yes, this is a"
76,"message to Colonel Mace from Jo. Jo Nakashima. Look, you should have"
77,got my email. I've been investigating a number of deaths related to
78,ATMOS systems. 
79,ATMOS: Go straight on. 
80,"JO: Now, I can't prove anything, but there's got to be a link. I need"
81,"you to check out all the people who died in ATMOS cars yesterday, and"
82,then check out the time. 
83,ATMOS: Turn right. 
84,(Jo obeys the mechanical voice and finds herself on a piece of rough
85,ground by the river.) 
86,JO: I don't believe this. 
87,ATMOS: This is your final destination. 
88,"JO: I said, take me to UNIT. "
89,ATMOS: Go straight on. 
90,"JO: I don't think so. I'll find my own way, thanks. "
91,(The car puts itself in gear and the engine revs.) 
92,ATMOS: This is your final destination. 
93,(The central locking is activated.) 
94,ATMOS: This is your final destination. This is your final destination. 
95,JO: No. No. Help! No! 
96,ATMOS: This is your final destination. 
97,JO: No! No! 
98,(The car speeds off the concrete shoulder into the river.)
99,
100,[Tardis]
101,
102,DONNA: I can't believe I'm doing this! 
103,"DOCTOR: No, neither can I. Oh, careful. "
104,"(He hits the console with a hammer and pulls a lever, then lets Donna"
105,take control again.) 
106,DOCTOR: Left hand down. Left hand down! Getting a bit too close to the
107,1980s. 
108,"DONNA: What am I going to do, put a dent in them? "
109,"DOCTOR: Well, someone did. "
110,(A telephone rings.) 
111,DONNA: Hold on. That's a phone. 
112,(The Doctor takes a mobile phone from a socket in the console.) 
113,DONNA: You've got a mobile? Since when? 
114,DOCTOR: It's not mine. 
115,(He answers the it.) 
116,DOCTOR: Hello? 
117,[Industrial estate]
118,
119,"MARTHA: Doctor? It's Martha, and I'm bringing you"
120,back to Earth. 
121,"(The Tardis materialises in an alleyway behind Martha, and the Doctor"
122,steps out.) 
123,DOCTOR: Martha Jones. 
124,MARTHA: Doctor. 
125,(They hug.) 
126,DOCTOR: You haven't changed a bit. 
127,MARTHA: Neither have you. 
128,DOCTOR: How's the family? 
129,MARTHA: You know. Not so bad. Recovering. 
130,(Donna comes out of the Tardis.) 
131,DOCTOR: What about you? 
132,"MARTHA: Right. Should have known. Didn't take you long to replace me,"
133,then. 
134,"DOCTOR: Now, don't start fighting. Martha, Donna. Donna, Martha. Please"
135,don't fight. Can't bear fighting. 
136,DONNA: You wish. 
137,(The women shake hands.) 
138,DONNA: I've heard all about you. He talks about you all the time. 
139,MARTHA: I dread to think. 
140,"DONNA: No, no, no. No, ne says nice things. Good things. Nice things."
141,Really good things. 
142,MARTHA: Oh my God. He's told you everything. 
143,DONNA: Didn't take long to get over it though. Who's the lucky man? 
144,DOCTOR: What man? Lucky what? 
145,"DONNA: She's engaged, you prawn. "
146,DOCTOR: Really? Who to? 
147,MARTHA: Tom. That Tom Milligan. He's in pediatrics. Working out in
148,"Africa right now. And yes, I know, I've got a doctor who disappears off"
149,to distant places. Tell me about it. 
150,DONNA: Is he skinny? 
151,"MARTHA: No, he's sort of strong. "
152,"DONNA: He is too skinny for words. You give him a hug, you get a paper"
153,cut. 
154,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'd rather you were fighting. "
155,MARTHA: Speaking of which. 
156,"WOMAN : Doctor Jones, report to base, please. Over. "
157,(Martha answers her walkie-talkie.) 
158,"MARTHA: This is Doctor Jones. Operation Blue Sky is go, go, go. I"
159,"repeat, this is a go. "
160,"(A convoy of jeeps, trucks and a squad of the Parachute Regiment go"
161,past.) 
162,"SOLDIER: Unified Intelligence Taskforce. Raise that barrier, now! (A"
163,"car with Army top brass goes past, and they all go to the ATMOS"
164,factory.) 
165,"SOLDIER: Leave those safeties on, lads. They're non-hostiles. "
166,"TANNOY: All workers, lay down your tools and surrender. "
167,"MARTHA: Greyhound Six to Trap One. B Section, go, go, go. Search the"
168,ground floor. Grid pattern delta. 
169,DOCTOR: What are you searching for? 
170,MARTHA: Illegal aliens. 
171,TANNOY: This is a UNIT operation. All workers lay down your tools and
172,surrender immediately. 
173,"MARTHA: B section mobilised. E section, F section, on my command. "
174,(Martha runs off to join the troops under her command.) 
175,DONNA: Is that what you did to her? Turned her into a soldier? 
176,[Spaceship]
177,
178,(Everything is being watched on a screen.) 
179,"SKREE: As predicted, the UNIT forces have moved to the penultimate"
180,stage. 
181,"STAAL: Observe their troops. Thin fabrics, exposed skin, feeble"
182,weapons. These are toy soldiers. The playthings of children. 
183,[Industrial estate]
184,
185,DOCTOR: And you're qualified now. You're a proper
186,doctor. 
187,"MARTHA: UNIT rushed it through ,given my experience in the field. Here"
188,we go. We're establishing a field base on site. They're dying to meet
189,you. 
190,DOCTOR: Wish I could say the same. 
191,(They get into the back of a pantechnicon truck.)
192,
193,[Mobile HQ]
194,
195,"MARTHA: Operation Blue Sky complete, sir. Thanks"
196,"for letting me take the lead. And, this is the Doctor. Doctor, Colonel"
197,Mace. 
198,MACE: Sir. 
199,"DOCTOR: Oh, don't salute. "
200,"MACE: But it's an honour, sir. I've read all the files on you."
201,"Technically speaking, you're still on staff. You never resigned. "
202,"DONNA: What, you used to work for them? "
203,"DOCTOR: Yeah, long time ago. Back in the 70's. Or was it the 80's? But"
204,it was all a bit more homespun back then. 
205,"MACE: Times have changed, sir. "
206,"DOCTOR: Yeah, that's enough of the sir. "
207,"MARTHA: Come on, though, Doctor. You've seen it. You've been on board"
208,"the Valiant. We've got massive funding from the United Nations, all in"
209,the name of Home World Security. 
210,MACE: A modern UNIT for the modern world. 
211,"DONNA: What, and that means arresting ordinary factory workers, in the"
212,"streets, in broad daylight? It's more like Guantanamo Bay out there."
213,"Donna, by the way. Donna Noble, since you didn't ask. I'll have a"
214,salute. 
215,"(Mace looks at the Doctor, who gives a sort of nod, so the Colonel"
216,salutes Donna.) 
217,MACE: Ma'am. 
218,DONNA: Thank you. 
219,"DOCTOR: Tell me, what's going on in that factory? "
220,"MACE: Yesterday, fifty two people died in identical circumstances,"
221,"right across the world, in eleven different time zones. Five a.m. in"
222,"the UK, six a.m. in France, eight a.m. in Moscow, one p.m. in China. "
223,DOCTOR: You mean they died simultaneously. 
224,"MACE: Exactly. Fifty two deaths at the exact same moment, worldwide. "
225,DOCTOR: How did they die? 
226,MACE: They were all inside their cars. 
227,MARTHA: They were poisoned. I checked the biopsies. No toxins. Whatever
228,"it is, left the system immediately. "
229,DOCTOR: What have the cars got in common? 
230,"MARTHA: Completely different makes. They're all fitted with ATMOS, and"
231,that is the ATMOS factory. 
232,DOCTOR: What's ATMOS? 
233,"DONNA: Oh, come on. Even I know that. Everyone's got ATMOS. "
234,[ATMOS factory]
235,
236,MARTHA: Stands for Atmospheric Omission System. Fit
237,"ATMOS in your car, it reduces CO2 emissions to zero. "
238,"DOCTOR: Zero? No carbon, none at all? "
239,DONNA: And you get sat-nav and twenty quid in shopping vouchers if you
240,introduce a friend. Bargain. 
241,"MACE: And this is where they make it, Doctor. Shipping worldwide."
242,"Seventeen factories across the globe, but this is the central depot,"
243,sending ATMOS to every country on Earth. 
244,DOCTOR: And you think ATMOS is alien. 
245,MACE: It's our job to investigate that possibility. Doctor? 
246,(The paratroopers are still rounding up workers as Mace leads them
247,through a plastic strip curtain.) 
248,"SOLDIER: Come on, look lively. Up the pace, go on. We haven't got all"
249,day now.
250,
251,[Office]
252,
253,(An ATMOS device is on a table.) 
254,"MACE: And here it is, laid bare. ATMOS can be threaded through any and"
255,every make of car. 
256,"DOCTOR: You must've checked it, before it went on sale. "
257,MARTHA: We did. We found nothing. That's why I thought we needed an
258,expert. 
259,"DOCTOR: Really. who'd you get? Oh, right. Me, yes. Good. "
260,(Martha and Mace leave.) 
261,DONNA: Okay. So why would aliens be so keen on cleaning up our
262,atmosphere? 
263,DOCTOR: A very good question. 
264,DONNA: Maybe they want to help. Get rid of pollution and stuff. 
265,DOCTOR: Do you know how many cars there are on planet Earth? Eight
266,"hundred million. Imagine that. If you could control them, you'd have"
267,eight hundred million weapons. 
268,[Basement]
269,
270,(Two paratroopers are searching with the aid of
271,flashlights and a floor plan.) 
272,GRAY: We should head back. There's not much down here. Should be just
273,"boiler rooms, generators. "
274,(His companion walks into a corridor and the overhead lights come on.) 
275,"HARRIS: Aye, aye. What's this, then? "
276,(Two workers are standing guard by the door at the end.) 
277,HARRIS: You two. All personnel have been ordered to evacuate. The
278,building's under UNIT control. 
279,WORKER: This area is out of bounds. 
280,"HARRIS: Excuse me, sunshine? I think you'll find we're in charge. We"
281,"can do this the easy way, or the hard way. "
282,[Spaceship]
283,
284,SKREE: General Staal? They are close. 
285,"STAAL: Excellent. And like a good warrior, I shall enter the fray"
286,myself. Let them pass. 
287,[Basement]
288,
289,"(The two workers slowly look at each other, then"
290,one opens the door.) 
291,WORKER: It's open. 
292,HARRIS: Oh. Come on. 
293,[Clone laboratory]
294,
295,(The lights finally come on to reveal vats and
296,equipment.) 
297,HARRIS: What the hell? 
298,GRAY: Greyhound Sixteen to Trap One. We've found something. Basement
299,"corridor, north side, grid thirty six. Request backup, over. "
300,(They go over to a lidded bath with a long trolley next to it.) 
301,HARRIS: It's like something boiling inside. 
302,GRAY: Don't touch it. 
303,"HARRIS: Come on, Steve. We get first rights on this. That means"
304,promotion. 
305,GRAY: Just leave it alone. Wait for backup. 
306,(There is a bang from inside the bath.) 
307,GRAY: What was that? 
308,HARRIS: It came from inside. 
309,GRAY: Could just be the machinery. 
310,(Bang. Bang.) 
311,HARRIS: Is there someone in there? Hello? We've got to get this open. 
312,GRAY: We should wait for the others. 
313,HARRIS: You could suffocate in there. 
314,"GRAY: Greyhound Sixteen to Trap One, request immediate assistance."
315,"Repeat, immediate assistance, over. "
316,HARRIS: How do you work this thing? Come on. 
317,(An alarm sounds as the lid rises up on four pulleys. The bath contains
318,bubbling green liquid.) 
319,"GRAY: Oh God, it stinks. "
320,HARRIS: What the hell is that stuff? 
321,"(A bland, naked body rises out of the liquid and tries to touch Harris."
322,It has no eyes and an incomplete mouth.) 
323,GRAY: Identify yourself! Identify! Greyhound Sixteen declaring Absolute
324,"emergency, sir. Repeat, Absolute emergency. Over. "
325,HARRIS: Can you hear me? Can you understand me? Look at its neck. Looks
326,like an umbilical cord. 
327,"GRAY: Well, don't get too close. "
328,HARRIS: I think it's harmless. I don't even think it's properly alive. 
329,(The being goes back underneath the liquid.) 
330,GRAY: It's going to drown. 
331,"HARRIS: No. I think it breathes this stuff, like some kind of embryo. "
332,"GRAY: What do you mean, an embryo? "
333,HARRIS: Someone's growing a body. A human body. 
334,STAAL : Excellent skills of deduction. 
335,(They turn their weapons on a squat armoured figure with no neck and
336,"three fingers. Yes, it is a Sontaran.) "
337,"STAAL: I would rate you above average, soldier. Well done. Whereas you,"
338,you smell of sweat and fear. 
339,"HARRIS: Yeah? Well, we're not the ones who got out of school early,"
340,sonny. Now stop playing Humpty Dumpty and tell us who you are. 
341,STAAL: Is that a reference to my height? 
342,"HARRIS: Short answer, yes. "
343,STAAL: A pity. Words are the weapons of womenfolk. I must judge you
344,unfit. 
345,"HARRIS: Oh, what you going to do, bite our ankles? "
346,(Staal fires his stick weapon at Harris's ankle.) 
347,GRAY: I'm warning you! 
348,STAAL: A proper soldier gives no warning. Fire. I order you. Fire. 
349,(Gray's semi-automatic does not fire.) 
350,"STAAL: The room is contained within a cordolaine signal, exciting the"
351,"copper surface of the bullet and causing expansion within the barrel,"
352,rendering your guns useless. And your radio signals have been blocked. 
353,"(Gray tries to use his gun as a club, but Staal zaps him.) "
354,GRAY: My legs. I can't feel my legs. 
355,(The workers enter.) 
356,"STAAL: I apologise for disabling you. Death has more honour, but you"
357,are needed for the stratagem. Prepare them for processing. You spoke of
358,promotion. Now you will serve a greater cause. 
359,HARRIS: Who are you? 
360,"STAAL: Indeed, know your enemy. I am General Staal of the Tenth"
361,Sontaran Battle Fleet. Known as Staal the Undefeated. 
362,(Staal removes his helmet.) 
363,"GRAY: Oh, my God, help us! "
364,[Office]
365,
366,(The Doctor is looking at ATMOS's components.) 
367,DOCTOR: Ionising nano-membrane carbon dioxide converter. Which means
368,that ATMOS works. Filters the CO2 at a molecular level. 
369,"MACE: We know all that, but what's its origin? Is it alien? "
370,"DOCTOR: No. Decades ahead of its time. Look, do you mind? Could you"
371,stand back a bit? 
372,"MACE: Sorry, have I done something wrong? "
373,DOCTOR: You're carrying a gun. I don't like people with guns hanging
374,"around me, all right? "
375,MACE: If you insist. 
376,(Mace leaves.) 
377,MARTHA: Tetchy. 
378,"DOCTOR: Well, it's true. "
379,MARTHA: He's a good man. 
380,DOCTOR: People with guns are usually the enemy in my books. You seem
381,quite at home. 
382,"MARTHA: If anyone got me used to fighting, it's you. "
383,"DOCTOR: Oh right, so it's my fault. "
384,"MARTHA: Well, you got me the job. Besides, look at me. Am I carrying a"
385,gun? 
386,DOCTOR: Suppose not. 
387,"MARTHA: It's all right for you. You can just come and go, but some of"
388,"us have got to stay behind. So I've got to work from the inside, and by"
389,"staying inside, maybe I stand a chance of making them better. "
390,DOCTOR: Yeah? That's more like Martha Jones. 
391,MARTHA: I learned from the best. 
392,DOCTOR: Well. 
393,(Donna enters.) 
394,"DONNA: Oi, you lot. All your storm troopers and your sonics. You're"
395,rubbish. Should've come with me. 
396,"DOCTOR: Why, where have you been? "
397,"DONNA: Personnel. That's where the weird stuff's happening, in the"
398,"paperwork. Because I spent years working as a temp, I can find my way"
399,"round an office blindfold, and the first thing I noticed is an empty"
400,file. 
401,"DOCTOR: Why, what's inside it? Or what's not inside it? "
402,DONNA: Sick days. There aren't any. Hundreds of people working here and
403,"no one's sick. Not one hangover, man flu, sneaky little shopping trip,"
404,nothing. Not ever. They don't get ill. 
405,MACE: That can't be right. 
406,DONNA: You've been checking out the building. Should've been checking
407,out the workforce. 
408,MARTHA: I can see why he likes you. 
409,DONNA: Mmm hmm. 
410,MARTHA: You are good. 
411,DONNA: Super temp. 
412,"MACE: Doctor Jones, set up a medical post. Start examining the workers."
413,I'll get them sent through. 
414,"MARTHA: Come on, Donna. Give me a hand. "
415,[ATMOS factory]
416,
417,"DOCTOR: So this, this ATMOS thing. Where'd it come"
418,from? 
419,MACE: Luke Rattigan himself. 
420,DOCTOR: And himself would be? 
421,[Mobile HQ]
422,
423,(Rattigan's file is shown on a computer
424,screen.) 
425,MACE: Child genius. Invented the Fountain Six search engine when he was
426,twelve years old. Millionaire overnight. Now runs the Rattigan Academy.
427,"A private school, educating students handpicked from all over the"
428,world. 
429,DOCTOR: A hothouse for geniuses. Wouldn't mind going there. I get
430,lonely. 
431,[Personnel office]
432,
433,DONNA: Do you think I should warn my mum about the
434,ATMOS in her car? 
435,MARTHA: Better safe then sorry. 
436,DONNA: I'll give her a call. 
437,"MARTHA: Donna. Do they know where you are? Your family. I mean, that"
438,you're travelling with the Doctor? 
439,DONNA: Not really. Although my granddad sort of waved us off. I didn't
440,have time to explain. 
441,MARTHA: You just left him behind? 
442,DONNA: Yeah. 
443,"MARTHA: I didn't tell my family. I kept it all so secret, and it almost"
444,destroyed them. 
445,DONNA: In what way? 
446,"MARTHA: They ended up imprisoned. They were tortured. My Mum, my Dad,"
447,"my sister. It wasn't the Doctor's fault, but you need to be careful."
448,"Because you know the Doctor. He's wonderful, he's brilliant, but he's"
449,like fire. Stand too close and people get burnt. 
450,[Basement]
451,
452,(Grey and Harris come out of the laboratory
453,"followed by Staal, who has put his helmet back on.) "
454,STAAL: Conditioning is complete. Now do your duty and advance the
455,conquest. 
456,"GREY + HARRIS: Yes, sir. "
457,[Clone laboratory]
458,
459,STAAL: General Staal returning. The stratagem
460,advances. 
461,(Staal walks past the clone bath and into a circular device.) 
462,STAAL: The last days of planet Earth. 
463,(Staal activates the transmat.)
464,
465,[ATMOS factory]
466,
467,DOCTOR: You are not coming with me. I want to talk
468,"to this Luke Rattigan, not point a gun at him. "
469,MACE: It's ten miles outside London. How are you going to get there? 
470,"DOCTOR: Well then, get me a jeep. "
471,MACE: According to the records you travel by Tardis.

724,"DOCTOR: No, it's a good weakness. "
725,RATTIGAN: Aren't you meant to be clever? Only an idiot would provoke
726,him. 
727,"DOCTOR: No, but the Sontarans are fed by a probic vent in the back of"
728,"their neck. That's their weak spot. Which means, they always have to"
729,face their enemies in battle. Isn't that brilliant? They can never turn
