21,
22,(The bunting is out for the 2012 Olympics in the
23,"brand new Stratford housing estate, and potholes are being repaired"
24,with new tarmac. Life moves on normally.) 
25,"POSTMAN: Morning, love. "
26,WOMAN: Morning. 
27,(The young mother pushes her pram past Tom in goal and his friend Dale
28,kicking a football on the tiny front lawn while doting Dad washes the
29,car.) 
30,DALE: Yes! 
31,WOMAN: Hiya! 
32,TOM'S DAD: All right? 
33,(On the lamp post is a missing persons poster - Jane McKillen. The
34,scene is watched from an upstairs window by a young girl. An old woman
35,wheels her shopping bag along the pavement nervously. The young girl's
36,mother puts the rubbish out.) 
37,TRISH: Maeve? Are you okay? 
38,"MAEVE: No, love, I'm not. "
39,TRISH: Do you want me to call a doctor? 
40,"MAEVE: Doctor can't help. Can't you, can't you feel it, Trish? "
41,TRISH: I can't feel anything. 
42,"MAEVE: Boys, get indoors! Get inside! Get them inside! "
43,TOM'S DAD: What's up with you? They ain't done nothing wrong. 
44,MAEVE: It's happening again! 
45,(Trish looks up to her daughter's window then goes back inside number
46,53.)
47,
48,[Chloe's bedroom]
49,
50,CHLOE: (sings) Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree.
51,"Merry merry king of the bush is he. Laugh, Kookaburra, laugh,"
52,"Kookaburra, gay your life must be. "
53,(Chloe turns from the window and starts drawing on a piece of paper.)
54,
55,[Dame Kelly Holmes Close]
56,
57,MAEVE: They're not safe. 
58,TOM'S DAD: They're in the garden. 
59,MAEVE: That's what it likes. It likes it when they're playing. Get them
60,"in, I'm begging you. "
61,[Chloe's bedroom]
62,
63,"CHLOE: Merry merry king of the bush is he. Laugh,"
64,"Kookaburra, laugh, Kookaburra, gay your life must be. "
65,"(Chloe finishes her picture of Dale, with his Union Flag t-shirt.)"
66,
67,[Dame Kelly Holmes Close]
68,
69,TOM'S DAD: It's all right. I've got my beady eyes
70,on them. Come on. 
71,"MAEVE: But, I "
72,TOM'S DAD: Come on. 
73,"(Tom kicks the ball into the goal, but Dale isn't there any more.) "
74,MAEVE: No! 
75,TOM'S DAD: Tom? 
76,MAEVE: What are you? 
77,TOM'S DAD: Where's he gone? 
78,[House]
79,
80,MAEVE : What do you want with our children?? 
81,"(Chloe finishes the picture, and the boy on the paper runs forward,"
82,screaming silently.)
83,
84,[Open ground]
85,
86,(The Tardis materialises in the Tardis-sized gap
87,between a pair of cargo
88,"containers. For once, she gets the door on the wrong side. The Doctor"
89,can't get out.)
90,DOCTOR: Ah. 
91,(He turns her ninety degrees while a train whizzes along the track
92,between the open ground and the housing estate.) 
93,DOCTOR: Ah! 
94,(Rose checks out a Shane Ward Greatest Hits poster on one of the
95,containers.) 
96,"ROSE: So, near future, yeah? "
97,"DOCTOR: I had a passing fancy. Only it didn't pass, it stopped."
98,
99,[Dame Kelly Holmes Close] 
100,DOCTOR: Thirtieth Olympiad. 
101,ROSE: No way! Why didn't I think of this? That's great. 
102,DOCTOR: Only seems like yesterday a few naked Greek blokes were tossing
103,"a discus about, wrestling each other in the sand with crowds stood"
104,"around baying. No, wait a minute, that was Club Med. Just in time for"
105,"the opening doo dah, ceremony, tonight, I thought you'd like that. Last"
106,"one they had in London was dynamite. Wembley, 1948. I loved it so much,"
107,I went back and watched it all over again. Fella carrying the torch.
108,"Lovely chap, what was his? "
109,(Tom's dad is putting up Missing posters on the lampposts.) 
110,"DOCTOR: Mark? John? Mark? Legs like pipe cleaners, but strong as a"
111,whippet. 
112,"(John Mark, 1925-1991) "
113,ROSE: Doctor. 
114,"DOCTOR: And in those days, everybody had a tea party to go to. "
115,ROSE: Doctor! 
116,DOCTOR: Did you ever have one of those little cakes with the crunchy
117,ball bearings on top? 
118,ROSE: You should really look at this. 
119,DOCTOR: Do you know those things? Nobody else in this entire galaxy's
120,ever even bothered to make edible ball bearings. Genius. 
121,"(The Doctor goes to Rose, and reads the two posters. The boy's name is"
122,Dale Hicks.) 
123,"DOCTOR: What's taking them, do you think? Snatching children from a"
124,thoroughly ordinary street like this. Why's it so cold? Is someone
125,reducing the temperature? 
126,ROSE: It says they all went missing this week. Why would a person do
127,something like this? 
128,DOCTOR: What makes you think it's a person? 
129,(A woman puts out her rubbish and goes straight back inside. There is
130,no one else about apart from the council roadmenders and their white
131,van.) 
132,"ROSE: Whatever it is, it's got the whole street scared to death."
133,"Doctor, what "
134,(The Doctor has run up the street to investigate the front lawn and its
135,goal. He holds his hand out over the grass. A man in a Mini drives into
136,"the road, and the engine gives out. One of the road menders comes over"
137,to help.) 
138,"KEL: There you go. Fifth today. Not natural, is it? "
139,"DRIVER: I don't know what happened, I had it serviced less than a month"
140,ago. 
141,"KEL: Nah, don't even try and explain it, mate. All the cars are doing"
142,"it. And do you know what? It's bonkers. Bonkers. Come on then, pal."
143,"I'll help you shift it. Quicker you're on the way, happier you'll be. "
144,(The two men start pushing the car.) 
145,KEL: There we go. 
146,ROSE: Do you want a hand? 
147,"KEL: No, we're all right, love. "
148,"ROSE: You're not. I'm tougher than I look, honest. "
149,"(Rose joins Kel pushing at the back, and the engine suddenly bursts"
150,"into life. Kel falls over, the driver gets back in drives off.) "
151,ROSE: Does this happen a lot? 
152,"DRIVER: Cheers, mate! "
153,KEL: Been doing it all week. 
154,ROSE: Since those children started going missing? 
155,"KEL: Yeah, I suppose so. "
156,(Back at the goal.) 
157,"DOCTOR: Ooo, tickles! "
158,TOM'S DAD: What's your game? 
159,DOCTOR: My er. Snakes and Ladders? Quite good at squash. Reasonable.
160,"I'm being facetious, aren't I. There's no call for it. "
161,"KEL: Every car cuts out. The council are going nuts. I mean, they've"
162,given this street the works. Renamed it. I've been tarmacking every pot
163,"hole. Look at that. Beauty, init? Yeah! And all that is because that"
164,Olympic Torch comes right by the end of this Close. Just down there.
165,"Everything's got to be perfect, ain't it? Only it ain't. "
166,MAEVE: It takes them when they're playing. 
167,ROSE: What takes them? 
168,"MAEVE: Danny, Jane, Dale. Snatched in the blink of an eye. "
169,(Tom's dad has the Doctor backing away onto the road.) 
170,"DOCTOR: I'm, I'm a police officer! That's what I am. I've got a badge"
171,"and a police car. You don't have to get. I can, I can prove it. Just"
172,hold on. 
173,"TOM'S DAD: We've had plenty of coppers poking around here, and you"
174,don't look or sound like any of them. 
175,"DOCTOR: See, look. I've got a colleague. Lewis. "
176,"TOM'S DAD: Well, she looks less like a copper than you do. "
177,"DOCTOR: Training. New recruit. It was either that or hairdressing, so,"
178,voila! 
179,(The Doctor brandishes his psychic paper in front of Tom's dad.) 
180,TRISH: What are you going to do? 
181,"MAEVE: The police have knocked on every door. No clues, no leads,"
182,nothing. 
183,"TOM'S DAD: Look, kids run off sometimes, all right? That's what they"
184,do. 
185,"MAEVE: Saw it with me own eyes. Dale Hicks in your garden, playing with"
186,"your Tommy, and then pfft! Right in front of me, like he was never"
187,there. There's no need to look any further than this street. It's right
188,here amongst us. 
189,DOCTOR: Why don't we 
190,WOMAN: Why don't we start with him? There's been all sorts like him in
191,"this street, day and night. "
192,KEL: Fixing things up for the Olympics. 
193,"TOM'S DAD: Yeah, and taking an awful long time about it. "
194,DOCTOR: I'm of the opinion that all we've got to do is just 
195,"KEL: You don't. What you just said, that's slander! "
196,WOMAN: I don't care what it is. 
197,DOCTOR: I think we need to just 
198,KEL: I want an apology off her. 
199,MAEVE: Stop picking on him. 
200,"KEL: Yeah, stop picking on me. "
201,MAEVE: And stop pretending to be blind. It's evil! 
202,WOMAN: I don't believe in evil. 
203,"KEL: Oh no, you just believe in tarmackers with sack loads of kidnapped"
204,kiddies in their van. 
205,"TOM'S DAD: Here, here, here, that's not what she's saying. "
206,KEL: Would you stop ganging up on me. 
207,"WOMAN: Feeling guilty, are we? "
208,DOCTOR: Fingers on lips! 
209,(Everyone joins the Doctor in making the Shush gesture.) 
210,"DOCTOR: In the last six days, three of your children have been stolen."
211,"Snatched out of thin air, right? "
212,"MAEVE: Er, can I? Look around you. This was a safe street till it came."
213,It's not a person. I'll say it if no one else will. Maybe you're
214,"coppers, maybe you're not. I don't care who you are. Can you please"
215,help us? 
216,(Rose looks up at Chloe in the window. Trish notices and goes back
217,"inside. Later, the Doctor is back at Tom's house, sniffing.) "
218,ROSE: Want a hanky? 
219,DOCTOR: Can you smell it? What does it remind you of? 
220,ROSE: Sort of metal? 
221,DOCTOR: Mmm hmm. 
222,ROSE: Oh. 
223,[Back alley]
224,
225,(Going between two lots of back gardens. We call it
226,a jennel in my part of the world.) 
227,DOCTOR: Danny Edwards cycled in one end but never came out the other.
228,"Whoa, there it goes again! Look at the hairs on the back of my manly"
229,hairy hand. 
230,"ROSE: And there's that smell. It's like a er, a burnt fuse plug or"
231,something. 
232,DOCTOR: There's a residual energy in the spots where the kids vanished.
233,"Whatever it was, it used an awful lot of power to do this. "
234,[Chloe's bedroom] 
235,"(Chloe watches a ginger cat in her front garden,"
236,then settles down to draw again.) 
237,"TRISH: You have to come down some time, Chloe. "
238,"CHLOE: I'm busy, mum. "
239,TRISH: Look at it in here. You must've used up half a rainforest. 
240,(Chloe is drawing the cat on Dale's picture. He is now sitting in the
241,bottom left corner.) 
242,TRISH: That's Dale. Why did you draw him so sad? 
243,"CHLOE: I didn't draw him like that. Dale made himself sad, so I'm going"
244,to draw him a friend. That's what he needs. More friends. 
245,TRISH: Have you seen the TV? 
246,"(Trish clicks on Chloe's laptop, and News24 comes on with its live"
247,Countdown to the Games. Huw Edwards' soft Welsh lilt provides the
248,commentary.) 
249,"TRISH: Look, this'll cheer you up. The Torch is getting close. It'll"
250,pass right by our street. And tonight they'll light the Olympic Flame
251,"in the stadium, and the whole world will be looking at our city. I"
252,"mean, doesn't that make you feel part of something? Sweetheart? Chloe? "
253,"CHLOE: I'm busy, mum. "
254,HUW EDWARDS : Danny Fairweather carries the torch past them on this
255,wonderful summer's day. Very fitting. We've seen lots of our sporting
256,"royalty, too. "
257,"TRISH: Okay. You're tired, Chloe. I heard you calling out again, last"
258,night. 
259,CHLOE: It's fine. 
260,TRISH: Nightmares? 
261,CHLOE: I'm drawing! 
262,"TRISH: Whatever they are, they're just dreams, you do know that? They"
263,can't hurt you. 
264,"CHLOE: I'm busy. Unless you want me to draw you, mum. "
265,"TRISH: If you want to stay cooped up in here, fine. I'll leave you to"
266,it. 
267,(Trish leaves. The cat is finished.)
268,
269,[Dame Kelly Holmes Close]
270,
271,ROSE: Aren't you a beautiful boy?? 
272,DOCTOR: Thanks! I'm experimenting with back combing. Oh. 
273,(Rose is talking to the ginger cat.) 
274,ROSE: I used to have one like you. What? 
275,"DOCTOR: No, I'm not really a cat person. Once you've been threatened by"
276,"one in a nun's wimple, it kind of takes the joy out of it. "
277,(The cat goes inside cardboard box.) 
278,"ROSE: Come here, puss. What do you want to go in there for? "
279,(There is a distant meow. The box is empty.) 
280,ROSE: Doctor! Phew. 
281,(The smell is very strong.) 
282,"DOCTOR: Whoa! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. Ion residue. Blimey! That takes some"
283,doing. Just to snatch a living organism out of space-time. This baby is
284,"just like, I'm having some of that. I'm impressed. "
285,ROSE: So the cat's been transported? 
286,DOCTOR: It can harness huge reserves of ionic power. We need to find
287,the source of that power. Find the source and you will find whatever
288,has taken to stealing children and fluffy animals. See what you can
289,"see. Keep them peeled, Lewis. "
290,[Chloe's bedroom]
291,
292,CHLOE: I've given you friends and you still moan.
293,"Moan, moan, moan. You're lucky. You're all together. You don't know"
294,"what it is to be alone. If you did, you'd be thanking me. No! (Under"
295,"the gaze of Danny's picture, frustrated Chloe does a big scribble on a"
296,piece of paper.)
297,
298,[Garages]
299,
300,(At the top of the close are the narrow three story
301,houses with the integral garage next to the front door. Rose hears a
302,noise coming from one of them.) 
303,"ROSE: Is that you, puss cat? Are you trapped? "
304,(More noises and thumping.) 
305,"ROSE: Not going to open it, not going to open it, not going to open it "
306,(The door is unlocked. Rose gently opens it and a big ball of scribble
307,knocks her down. The Doctor comes running.) 
308,DOCTOR: Stay still! 
309,"(He points his sonic screwdriver, and the ball becomes hand-sized. Rose"
310,grabs it.) 
311,DOCTOR: Okey dokey? 
312,"ROSE: Yeah, cheers. "
313,DOCTOR: No probs. I'll give you a fiver if you can tell me what the
314,"hell it is, because I haven't got the foggiest. "
315,"ROSE: Well, I can tell you you've just killed it. "
316,DOCTOR: It was never living. It's animated by energy. Same energy
317,that's snatching people. That is so dinky! The go anywhere creature.
318,"Fits in your pocket, makes friends, impresses the boss, breaks the ice"
319,at parties.
320,
321,[Tardis]
322,
323,(The ball is under analysis.) 
324,"DOCTOR: Oh, hi ho, here we go. Let's have a look. Get out of here. "
325,ROSE: What's it say? 
326,"(The Doctor uses the eraser end of a pencil on the ball, and rubs some"
327,of it out.) 
328,DOCTOR: It is. It's graphite. Basically the same material as an HB
329,pencil. 
330,ROSE: I was attacked by a pencil scribble? 
331,"DOCTOR: Scribble creature, brought into being with ionic energy."
332,"Whatever we're dealing with, it can create things as well as take them."
333,But why make a scribble creature? 
334,"ROSE: Maybe it was a mistake I mean, you scribble over something when"
335,you want to
336,"get rid of it, like a, like a drawing. Like a, a child's drawing. You"
337,said it was in the street. 
338,DOCTOR: Probably. 
339,ROSE: The girl. 
340,DOCTOR: Of course! What girl? 
341,ROSE: Something about her gave me the creeps. Even her own mum looked
342,scared of her. 
343,DOCTOR: Are you deducting? 
344,ROSE: I think I am. 
345,DOCTOR: Copper's hunch? 
346,"ROSE: Permission to follow it up, Sarge?"
347,
348,[Front door]
349,
350,"(The Doctor rings the doorbell, then rattles the"
351,letter box. Trish eventually answers the door.) 
352,DOCTOR: Hello. I'm the Doctor and this is Rose. Can we see your
353,daughter? 
354,"TRISH: No, you can't. "
355,DOCTOR: Okay. Bye. 
356,TRISH: Why? Why do you want to see Chloe? 
357,"DOCTOR: Well, there's some interesting stuff going on in this street,"
358,"and I just thought. Well, we thought, that she might like to give us a"
359,hand. 
360,ROSE: Sorry to bother you. 
361,"DOCTOR: Yeah, sorry. We'll let you get on with things. On your own. Bye"
362,again. 
363,TRISH: Wait! Can you help her? 
364,"DOCTOR: Yes, I can. "
365,[Living room]
366,
367,"(The television is on, of course.) "
368,"HUW EDWARDS : The Torch Bearer is running up the Mall, which I can"
369,tell you is 
370,"TRISH: She stays in her room most of the time. I try talking to her,"
371,"but it's like trying to speak to a brick wall. She gives me nothing,"
372,just asks to be left alone. 
373,ROSE: What about Chloe's dad? 
374,TRISH: Chloe's dad died a year ago. 
375,ROSE: I'm sorry. 
376,TRISH: You wouldn't be if you'd known him. 
377,"DOCTOR: Well, let's go and say hi. "
378,TRISH: I should check on her first. She might be asleep. 
379,"DOCTOR: Why are you afraid of her, Trish? "
380,TRISH: I want you to know before you see her that's she's really a
381,great kid. 
382,DOCTOR: I'm sure she is. 
383,TRISH: She's never been in trouble at school you should see her report
384,from last year. A's and B's. 
385,ROSE: Can I use your loo? 
386,TRISH: She's in the choir. She's singing in an old folks home. Any mum
387,would be proud. You know I want you to know these things before you see
388,"her, Doctor, because right now, she's not herself. "
389,"(Rose goes upstairs, and hides in the airing closet as Chloe comes out"
390,of her room and goes downstairs. She goes into Chloe's room and sees
391,"the wall covered in drawings, including Dale and the cat. There is a"
392,"noise from the wardrobe, and she knocks over a jar of coloured pencils."
393,"When she's picked them up again, Dale is scowling.)"
394,
395,[Kitchen]
396,
397,(Chloe is getting herself a drink of milk from the
398,fridge.) 
399,"DOCTOR: All right, there? I'm the Doctor. "
400,CHLOE: I'm Chloe Webber. 
401,"DOCTOR: How're you doing, Chloe Webber? "
402,"CHLOE: I'm busy. I'm making something, aren't I, mum. "
403,"TRISH: And like I said, she's not been sleeping. "
404,"DOCTOR: But you've been drawing, though. I'm rubbish. Stick men about"
405,"my limit. Can do this, though. "
406,(He gives the Vulcan salute.) 
407,DOCTOR: Can you do that? 
408,CHLOE: They don't stop moaning. 
409,TRISH: Chloe. 
410,"CHLOE: I try to help them, but they don't stop moaning. "
411,DOCTOR: Who don't? 
412,CHLOE: We can be together. 
413,TRISH: Sweetheart. 
414,"CHLOE: Don't touch me, mum. "
415,[Chloe's bedroom]
416,
417,(The doors to the wardrobe rattle again. Rose opens
418,them. A wind blows in her face. She parts the clothes to see a drawing
419,"of a bearded, yellow-eyed man.) "
420,CHLOE'S DAD : I'm coming.
421,
422,[Kitchen]
423,
424,"CHLOE: I'm busy, Doctor. "
425,"DOCTOR: Come on, Chloe. Don't be a spoil sport. What's the big project?"
426,I'm dying to know. What're you making up there? 
427,ROSE : Doctor! 
428,[Chloe's bedroom]
429,
430,(The Doctor gets there first.) 
431,CHLOE'S DAD : I'm coming to hurt you. 
432,(The Doctor shuts the doors.) 
433,ROSE: Look at it. 
434,"DOCTOR: No, ta. "
435,(He goes to look at the other pictures.) 
436,TRISH: What the hell was that? 
437,ROSE: A drawing. The face of a man. 
438,TRISH: What face? 
439,ROSE: Best not. 
440,TRISH: What've you been drawing? 
441,CHLOE: I'm drew him yesterday. 
442,TRISH: Who? 
443,CHLOE: Dad. 
444,"TRISH: Your dad? But he's long gone. Chloe, with all the lovely things"
445,"in the world, why him? "
446,"CHLOE: I dream about him, staring at me. "
447,TRISH: I thought we were putting him behind us. What's the matter with
448,you? 
449,CHLOE: We need to stay together. 
450,"TRISH: Yes, we do. "
451,"CHLOE: No. Not you, us. We need to stay together, and then it'll be all"
452,right. 
453,"ROSE: Trish, the drawings. Have you seen what Chloe's drawings can do? "
454,TRISH: Who gave you permission to come into her room? Get out of my
455,house. 
456,"DOCTOR: Tell us about the drawings, Chloe. "
457,TRISH: I don't want to hear any more of this. 
458,ROSE: But that drawing of her dad. I heard a voice. He spoke. 
459,"TRISH: He's dead. And these, they're kid's pictures. Now get out! "
460,"ROSE: Chloe has a power. And I don't know how, but she used it to take"
461,"Danny Edwards, Dale Hicks. She's using it to snatch the kids. "
462,TRISH: Get out. 
463,ROSE: Have you seen those drawings move? 
464,TRISH: I haven't seen anything. 
465,"DOCTOR: Yes, you have, out of the corner of your eye. "
466,TRISH: No. 
467,"DOCTOR: And you dismissed it, because what choice do you have when you"
468,"see something you can't possibly explain? You dismiss it, right? And if"
469,"anyone mentions it, you get angry, so it's never spoken of, ever again."
470,
471,TRISH: She's a child. 
472,"DOCTOR: You're terrified of her. But there's nowhere to turn to,"
473,because who's going to
474,believe the things you see out of the corner of your eye? No one.
475,Except me. 
476,TRISH: Who are you? 
477,DOCTOR: I'm help.

479,
480,(The Doctor absentmindedly starts eating marmalade
481,from a jar with his fingers.) 
482,ROSE: Ahem. 
483,(He realises what he is doing and puts it back.) 
484,"ROSE: Those pictures, they're alive. She's drawing people and they end"
485,up in her pictures. 
486,DOCTOR: Ionic energy. Chloe's harnessing it to steal those kids and
487,place them in some kid of holding pen made up of ionic power. 
488,ROSE: And what about the dad from hell in her wardrobe? 
489,TRISH: How many times do I have to tell you he's dead. 
490,"ROSE: Well, he's got a very loud voice for a dead bloke. "
491,"DOCTOR: If living things can become drawings, then maybe drawings can"
492,"become living things. Chloe's real dad is dead, but not the one who"
493,visits her in her nightmares. That dad seems very real. That's the dad
494,she's drawn and he's a heartbeat away from crashing into this world. 
495,TRISH: She always got the worst of it when he was alive. 
496,"ROSE: Doctor, how can a twelve year old girl be doing any of this? "
497,DOCTOR: Let's find out. 
498,[Chloe's bedroom]
499,
500,(Chloe is sitting on her bed. She does the Vulcan
501,salute when the Doctor enters.) 
502,DOCTOR: Nice one. 
503,(He puts his fingers on her temple and she rolls her eyes up. A sort of
504,"mind meld, while we're on the Spock theme. He lays her back on the"
505,bed.) 
506,DOCTOR: There we go. 
507,TRISH: I can't let him do this 
508,"ROSE: Shush, it's okay. Trust him. "
509,DOCTOR: Now we can talk. 
510,CHLOE: I want Chloe. Wake her up. I want Chloe. 
511,DOCTOR: Who are you? 
512,CHLOE: I want Chloe Webber. 
513,TRISH: What've you done to my little girl? 
514,"ROSE: Doctor, what is it? "
515,"DOCTOR: I'm speaking to you, the entity that is using this human child."
516,I request
517,parley in compliance with the Shadow Proclamation. 
518,CHLOE: I don't care about shadows or parleys. 
519,DOCTOR: So what do you care about? 
520,CHLOE: I want my friends. 
521,"DOCTOR: You're lonely, I know. Identify yourself. "
522,CHLOE: I am one of many. I travel with my brothers and sisters. We take
523,an endless journey. A thousand of your lifetimes. But now I am alone. I
524,"hate it. It's not fair, and I hate it. "
525,DOCTOR: Name yourself! 
526,CHLOE: Isolus. 
527,DOCTOR: You're Isolus. Of course. 
528,CHLOE: Our journey began in the Deep Realms when we were a family. 
529,(The Isolus is drawing as she speaks.) 
530,TRISH: What's that? 
531,"DOCTOR: The Isolus Mother, drifting in deep space. See, she jettisons"
532,millions of fledgling spores. Her children. The Isolus are empathic
533,"beings of intense emotions, but when they're cast off from their"
534,"mother, their empathic link, their need for each other, is what"
535,sustains them. They need to be together. They cannot be alone. 
536,CHLOE: Our journey is long. 
537,"DOCTOR: The Isolus children travel, each inside a pod. They ride the"
538,heat and energy of solar tides. It takes thousands and thousands of
539,years for them to grow up. 
540,ROSE: Thousands of years just floating through space. Poor things.
541,Don't they go mad with boredom? 
542,CHLOE: We play. 
543,ROSE: You play? 
544,"DOCTOR: While they travel, they play games. They use their ionic power"
545,to literally create make believe worlds in which to play. 
546,ROSE: In flight entertainment. 
547,"DOCTOR: Helps keep them happy. While they're happy, they can feed off"
548,"each others love. Without it, they're lost. Why did you come to Earth? "
549,CHLOE: We were too close. 
550,DOCTOR: That's a solar flare from your sun. Would have made a tidal
551,wave of solar energy that scattered the Isolus pods. 
552,"CHLOE: Only I fell to Earth. My brothers and sisters are left up there,"
553,and I cannot reach them. So alone. 
554,DOCTOR: Your pod crashed. Where is it? 
555,(Memory of a tiny white flower-like being flying into Chloe's room and
556,then into her mouth.) 
557,"CHLOE: My pod was drawn to heat, and I was drawn to Chloe Webber. She"
558,"was like me, alone. She needed me, and I her. "
559,DOCTOR: You empathised with her. You wanted to be with her because she
560,was alone like you. 
561,CHLOE: I want my family. It's not fair. 
562,DOCTOR: I understand. You want to make a family. But you can't stay in
563,this child. It's wrong. You can't steal any more friends for yourself. 
564,CHLOE: I am alone. 
565,(A crash from the wardrobe. A red glow and the door shakes. Chloe is
566,shaking.) 
567,CHLOE'S DAD : I'm coming to hurt you. I'm coming. 
568,"DOCTOR: Trish, how do you calm her? "
569,TRISH: What? 
570,"DOCTOR: When she has nightmares, what do you do? "
571,"TRISH: I, I "
572,DOCTOR: What do you do? 
573,TRISH: I sing to her. 
574,DOCTOR: Then start singing. 
575,"CHLOE'S DAD : Chloe, I'm coming. "
576,"TRISH: Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree. Merry, merry king of the"
577,bush is he 
578,CHLOE'S DAD : Chloe. Chloe. Chloe. Chloe. 
579,"TRISH: Laugh, Kookaburra, laugh, Kookaburra, gay your life must be."
580,"Laugh, Kookaburra, laugh, Kookaburra, gay your life must be. "
581,"(Chloe falls asleep, and the wardrobe falls silent.) "
582,"TRISH: He came to her because she was lonely. Chloe, I'm sorry."

585,
586,(They are collecting all the pencils they can
587,find.) 
588,TRISH: Chloe usually got the brunt of his temper when he'd had a drink.
589,"The day he crashed the car, I thought we were free. I thought it was"
590,over. 
591,ROSE: Did you talk to her about it? 
592,TRISH: I didn't want to. 
593,ROSE: But maybe that's why Chloe feels so alone. Because she has all
594,"these terrible dreams about her dad, but she can't talk to you about"
595,them. 
596,DOCTOR: Her and the Isolus. Two lonely kids who need each other. 
597,"ROSE: And it won't stop, will it, Doctor? It'll just keep pulling kids"
598,in. 
599,DOCTOR: It's desperate to be loved. It's used to a pretty big family. 
600,ROSE: How big? 
601,DOCTOR: Say around four billion? 
602,[Chloe's bedroom]
603,
604,(Chloe is watching the television on her laptop.) 
605,HUW EDWARDS : The queues started a week ago for those desperate
606,"enough to be inside, and lots of them are expecting a capacity crowd of"
607,eighty thousand for this evening's opening ceremony. I have to say
608,there's been 
609,[Dame Kelly Holmes Close]
610,
611,DOCTOR: We need that pod. 
612,ROSE: It crashed. Won't it be destroyed? 
613,"DOCTOR: Well, it's been sucking in all the heat it can. Hopefully that"
614,should keep it in a fit state to launch. It must be close. It should
615,have a weak energy signature that the Tardis can trace. Once we find
616,"it, then we can stop the Isolus. "
617,(Chloe watches them from her window.)
618,
619,[Living room]
620,
621,(Trish is on the telephone.) 
622,"TRISH: She's running a temperature. I can't go into that now, Kirsty."
623,"Yes, we've got a doctor. "
624,(Chloe sneaks out the front door.) 
625,"TRISH: Yeah, he said he can help her. "
626,[Open ground]
627,
628,DOCTOR: We can scan for the same trace that I
629,picked up from the scribble creature. We'd need to widen the field a
630,bit. 
631,(Chloe watches the Doctor and Rose go inside the Tardis.)
632,
633,[Tardis]
634,
635,(The Doctor is building a gizmo.) 
636,ROSE: You knew the Isolus was lonely before it told you. How? 
637,DOCTOR: I know what it's like to travel a long way on your own. Give me
638,the styner-magnetic. The thing in your left hand. 
639,ROSE: Sounds like you're on its side. 
640,"DOCTOR: I sympathise, that's all. "
641,ROSE: The Isolus has caused a lot of pain for these people. 
642,DOCTOR: It's a child. That's why it went to Chloe. Two lonely mixed up
643,kids. 
644,ROSE: Feels to me like a temper tantrum because it can't get its own
645,way. 
646,"DOCTOR: It's scared. Come on, you were a kid once. Binary dot. "
647,"ROSE: Yes, and I know what kids can be like. Right little terrors. "
648,(Chloe returns to her room and pulls the head off a doll to reveal her
649,secret stash of pencils.) 
650,DOCTOR: Gum. 
651,(Rose spits her chewing gum.) 
652,ROSE: I've got cousins. Kids can't have it all their own way. That's
653,part of being a family. 
654,DOCTOR: What about trying to understand them? 
655,ROSE: Easy for you to say. You don't have kids. 
656,DOCTOR: I was a dad once. 
657,ROSE: What did you say? 
658,"(The Doctor uses Rose's chewing gum to fix a component in place, then"
659,closes the lid on the glass globe containing the gizmo.) 
660,"DOCTOR: I think we're there. Fear, loneliness. They're the big ones,"
661,Rose. Some of the most terrible acts ever committed have been inspired
662,by them. We're not dealing with something that wants to conquer or
663,destroy. There's a lot of things you need to get across this universe.
664,"Warp drive, wormhole refractors. You know the thing you need most of"
665,all? You need a hand to hold. 
666,"(Rose is holding her hand out, so he takes it.) "
667,"ROSE: No, Look, I'm pointing. "
668,(The scanner is registering an energy source.) 
669,DOCTOR: It's the pod! It is in the street. Everything's coming up
670,Doctor. 
671,(Chloe starts drawing the Tardis.)
672,
673,[Open ground]
674,
675,DOCTOR: Okay. It's about two inches across. Dull
676,"grey, like a gull's egg. Very light. "
677,(Chloe draws the Doctor.) 
678,"ROSE: So these pods they travel from sun to sun using heat, yeah? So"
679,it's not all about love and stuff. Doesn't the pod just need heat? 
680,(There's a crash as the gizmo falls to the ground and breaks.)

696,Webber. 
697,"ROSE: Bring him back, now. "
698,CHLOE: No. 
699,ROSE: Don't you realise what you've done? He was the only one who could
700,help you. Now bring him back! 
701,CHLOE: Leave me alone! I love Chloe Webber! 
702,"ROSE: I know. I know. Doctor, if you can hear me, I'm going to get you"

714,lump. 
715,"ROSE: Kel, was there anything in this street in the last few days"
716,giving off a lot of heat? 
717,"KEL: I mean, you can eat your dinner off this. Beautiful. So you tell"
718,me why the other one's got a lump in it when I gave it the same love
719,and craftsmanship as I did this one. 
720,"ROSE: Well, when you've worked it out, put it in a big book about"
721,"tarmacking, but before you do that, think back six days. "
722,KEL: Six days. When I was laying this the first time round. 
723,ROSE: What? 
724,"KEL: Well, that's when I filled in this pothole for the first time. "

731,(Rose grabs a pick axe from the back of the van.) 
732,"KEL: Whoa, wait, wait, wait. You just removed a council axe from a"
733,"council van. Put it back. No, don't, wait. Put the axe back in the van."
734,That's my van. Give me the axe. No! Wait! No! 
735,(Rose starts digging up the pothole.) 
736,"KEL: No! You, stop! You just took a council axe from a council van and"
737,now you're digging up a council road! I'm reporting you to the council!

757,"HUW EDWARDS : My God! Er, what's going on here? "

762,"HUW EDWARDS : The crowd has vanished! Er, they're gone. Everyone"
763,has gone. Thousands of people have just gone. Right in front of my

771,and thirteen thousand athletes.

797,"ROSE: Look, I've got your pod. "
798,CHLOE: The pod is dead. 
799,ROSE: It only needs heat. 
800,CHLOE: It needs more than heat. 
801,"ROSE: What, then? "
802,"KEL: I'm not being funny or nothing, but that picture just moved. And"
803,that one! 
804,(The Doctor is pointing to an Olympic torch.) 
805,"ROSE: She didn't draw that, he did. But it needs more than heat,"
806,Doctor. 
807,HUW EDWARDS : Is still on its way. I suppose it's much more than a
808,"torch now, it's a beacon. It's a beacon of hope and fortitude and"
