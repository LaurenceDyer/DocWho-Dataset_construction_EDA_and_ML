21,
22,[Tardis] 
23,"(Escaping the carnage of Troy, the Doctor, Steven"
24,"and Katarina are safe aboard the Tardis, Vicki having decided to stay"
25,"behind. But Steven's battle injury's more serious than first appeared,"
26,"and blood poisoning makes him feverish. Katarina, the serving maid from"
27,"the palace of King Priam, stands by helplessly as the Doctor tries to"
28,"make Steven more comfortable. Steven lies on a divan, semi-conscious."
29,The Doctor is at the Tardis controls trying to work out where they may
30,"be heading whilst Katarina hovers, concerned.) "
31,KATARINA: He has a strange sickness. Can you not help him? 
32,"DOCTOR: I'm doing the very best I can, my child. Oh dear, dear, dear."
33,It is such a worry. This poison seems to be spreading throughout the
34,"whole of his system. Yes, we need a special drug. I shall have to land"
35,somewhere. 
36,KATARINA: What is that? 
37,"DOCTOR: Oh, we're slowing down, my dear. We're going to land in a"
38,moment. 
39,KATARINA: Can we have reached the place of perfection so soon? 
40,"DOCTOR: Ah, well, I rather doubt it. At least, that is, we shall be"
41,"stopping at a lot of places before that. Now, I want you to look after"
42,"Steven, if you will, and see that you keep that wound clean. Please?"
43,That's a good girl.

47,(Bret Vyon is bent over a small transmitter as
48,large animals roar. Everyone say Hi! to Nicholas Courtney) 
49,"BRET: Five Zero Alpha to Charlo Charlo Egan, Five Zero Alpha to Charlo"
50,"Charlo Egan, come in! Charlo Charlo Egan, this is Five Zero Alpha, can"
51,you read me? Come in! 
52,"(Close by, Kurt Gantry lies on the ground, his leg in a crude splint."
53,He exchanges a look of despair with Vyon.) 
54,"BRET: Nothing! When we get back to Earth, I'll have every fool in CCE"
55,court-martialed! 
56,KURT: If we get back to earth. If Central Communications has gone dead
57,"on us, we haven't a hope! "
58,BRET: We're not dead yet. 
59,KURT: Don't fool yourself. They're out there looking for us right now.
60,"They'll find us, and then "
61,"BRET: All right, all right, they may well find us, but we've got to get"
62,through to Earth first or the whole solar system is finished. 
63,KURT: I know. I know. Try them again. 
64,"BRET: Five Zero Alpha to Charlo Charlo Egan, come in. Five Zero Alpha"
65,"to Charlo Charlo Egan, come in!"

67,[Earth - Central Communications]
68,
69,"(Millions of miles away, in the central"
70,"communications control room on Earth, Vyon's call is registering on the"
71,"operations board. Unfortunately, the small flashing light that signals"
72,the incoming communication remains overlooked. The large room is
73,dominated by a map of the galaxy on one wall. Shaven-headed technics go
74,"about their tasks while the two duty officers, Roald and Lizan, return"
75,to their posts after a break.) 
76,"ROALD: So it's checkmate, isn't it? I want to see the Venus-Mars games."
77,"You want to see your hero,"
78,Mavic Chen. 
79,"LIZAN: (a woman) I just happen to admire him, that's all. Well, I'm"
80,"going to do some work now, even if you aren't. "
81,(Lizan takes an observation chart and moves across to the console.) 
82,"ROALD: I tell you what. If we tune into Channel 403, we'll get the"
83,news. That should cover both our requirements. Agreed? 
84,"LIZAN: Ah, but we may only get a report of what Mavic Chen said, not"
85,actually see him. 
86,ROALD: That's hardly likely. The Guardian of the Solar System is going
87,"away on holiday. He will, no doubt, say a few well-chosen words. Every"
88,well-chosen word will no doubt be transmitted. 
89,LIZAN: And what about the routine calls? 
90,"ROALD: Oh, you worry too much. The next one's Five Zero Alpha. "
91,LIZAN: Five Zero Alpha? 
92,"ROALD: It's not for another twenty minutes. Well, what about 403? "
93,LIZAN: Bring up 403 please. Five Zero Alpha? Is that the patrol out
94,looking for Marc Cory? 
95,"ROALD: Yes, the agent who disappeared near the planet Kembel. Probably"
96,"crashed, so they think. Hey, bring up the sound! It's Mavic Chen on"
97,holiday. 
98,CHEN : Yes. The mineral agreement with the fourth galaxy proved a
99,little more complicated than was at first expected. 
100,"INTERVIEWER : And as that has been concluded so successfully, I'm"
101,sure that no one will begrudge you little time off. Where are you going
102,to on this trip? 
103,CHEN : That I am keeping a secret. I hope to be able to get away
104,from all interviewers. I'm just going to climb aboard my Spar and drift
105,about the solar system. 
106,LIZAN: Drifting round the solar system! That's the life if you can get
107,it. 
108,"ROALD: Well, become a galactic politician and who knows? Maybe one day"
109,"you will. As far as I'm concerned, give me terra firma any day. "
110,"LIZAN: You are in a rut, my friend. Now if I had the latest Flip T-4, I"
111,
112,"ROALD: It's a trifle brash, isn't it? There are other space vessels,"
113,you know. 
114,LIZAN: You mean the Spar 740? 
115,"ROALD: Yes. If I had to travel around ultra-space, I'd think the 740."
116,"Elegance, plus ultimate technology. "
117,LIZAN: It hasn't got the speed. 
118,ROALD: Speed isn't everything. 
119,INTERVIEWER : Is there anything you would like to say to the
120,citizens before you depart? 
121,CHEN : Yes. It is my earnest hope that the solar system may
122,"continue along this path of peace, this path that was laid by the"
123,"signing of the non-aggression pact of 3975. Now, in this year of 4000,"
124,we can feel justly proud of that pact. May the past twenty five years
125,prove that they are the dawn of an everlasting peace which will spread
126,"throughout the universe. Let us go forward together, secure in the"
127,knowledge that the life ahead is built on the cornerstone of richer
128,"understanding, not only of the past or of the present, but also of the"
129,"future. And may it be this cornerstone, so firmly laid, be built upon"
130,"in brotherhood and bring peace, progress and prosperity to each and"
131,every one of us. 
132,INTERVIEWER : Thank you sir. I'm sure that all throughout our
133,system echo your thoughts. 
134,LIZAN: Even you must agree he's an impressive man. 
135,"ROALD: Yes, it's nice to hear his speech again. "
136,LIZAN: Cynic. 
137,LIZAN: Was that a flash? 
138,ROALD: Where? There's nothing coming through. 
139,LIZAN: I thought I saw one. 
140,ROALD: You're imagining things. 
141,"LIZAN: Okay, so I'm imagining things."

143,[Kembel - Jungle clearing]
144,
145,(Vyon abandons the transmitter. Kurt is gazing
146,nervously into the jungle.) 
147,"KURT: They are out there, I know it. And they're getting closer. "
148,BRET: You're imagining things. Now shut up. 
149,KURT: Do you think I'm a fool? There's something out there and it's
150,close. 
151,"BRET: Look, I tell you "
152,KURT: Just listen. There. 
153,BRET: Shh! 
154,KURT: You heard it? 
155,"BRET: Yes. Come on, we've got to get out of here. "
156,KURT: I stay. 
157,BRET: What? But you know we can't fight them. Our weapons are useless
158,against those things. Now we must move out. 
159,KURT: How can I keep on the move with this? Have you got any more
160,bright ideas? All that will happen is I'll hit one of those spiked
161,plants. I nearly fell on one before. 
162,"BRET: We won't go fast, just keep moving. I'll make sure we avoid the"
163,Varga plants. 
164,"KURT: If I fall and hit one, you know what happens then. "
165,BRET: Don't be a fool! 
166,"KURT: That could be what happened to Cory. He tripped, pricked himself"
167,"on a thorn, and then he turned into one. "
168,"BRET: You're letting your imagination run riot again. Besides, we"
169,haven't seen any Varga that look like him. 
170,"KURT: Joke away, but you know I'm right. There's been no trace of Marc"
171,Cory anywhere. 
172,BRET: Perhaps they took him prisoner. 
173,KURT: You know they don't take prisoners. 
174,BRET: All the more reason for you to come with me. Now come on. 
175,"(Bret moves to help Kurt to his feet, but Kurt pushes him away"
176,angrily.) 
177,"KURT: This is no time for phony heroics. I'll just slow you down, and"
178,then we'll both get it. Now without me you've got a chance. It's not a
179,"good one, but it's a chance. Just stay alive and get that message"
180,through. 
181,"BRET: I'm not going without you, is that clear? "
182,KURT: Get out! Get out of here or I'll kill you now! 
183,"(Kurt presses his gun into Vyon's chest. Bret is shocked, but realises"
184,his friend is deadly serious and moves to pick up the transmitter
185,before walking to the edge of the clearing.) 
186,KURT: Bret. Good luck. 
187,"(Vyon nods briefly, then quickly turns and disappears into the jungle."
188,"Kurt moves awkwardly to a better defensive position, his gun levelled"
189,at the darkness of the forest.) 
190,"KURT: All right, I'm ready for you now. "
191,(There's no response from the depths of the jungle. Kurt stares around
192,"wildly, becoming more and more unsettled.) "
193,KURT: Where the devil are you? Come on! 
194,"(Behind him, there's a trembling of leaves, and a dark shape emerges"
195,"from the jungle. A Dalek. As Kurt falls lifeless to the ground, the"
196,second Dalek glides out of the forest and scans the area.) 
197,DALEK 2: One man remains. Find and destroy him! 
198,DALEK 1: I obey! 
199,"(The Daleks glide away. Dashing through the dark jungle, Bret Vyon"
200,dodges to avoid a couple of Varga plants but then trips and crashes to
201,"the ground, smashing his radio transmitter. Vyon picks up the useless"
202,piece of equipment and looks at it in despair. As he tries to work out
203,"what to do next, a strange noise disturbs him. At the edge of the"
204,"clearing, Bret watches in amazement as the Tardis materialises. He"
205,"approaches the blue box cautionsly, ducking back out of sight when the"
206,"door opens. The Doctor emerges, followed by Katarina.) "
207,KATARINA: Strange place. Can you find help here? 
208,"DOCTOR: I don't know my dear, but I must try. Now, I want you to stay"
209,here and look after Steven. I shall be as quick as I can. 
210,KATARINA: I'll do as you ask. 
211,"DOCTOR: Splendid. Now you know which switch to pull to close the doors,"
212,"don't you, so I want you to do that straight away. I have my key to let"
213,myself in. 
214,KATARINA: Key? 
215,"DOCTOR: Yes. This, child. Key. This opens the door from the outside."
216,"Now go in please, and shut the door. Charming."
217,
218,[Outside the Tardis]
219,
220,"(With Katarina safely back inside the Tardis, the"
221,"Doctor sets off into the jungle. Once he's gone, Bret comes out of"
222,hiding and examines the Tardis doors. After a moment he turns and
223,hurries after the Doctor. 
224,[Kembel - Jungle]
225,
226,"(Before long, the Doctor catches sight of lights up"
227,"ahead. Moving closer, he sees a cluster of buildings in a wide valley,"
228,surrounded by dense jungle. i
229,DOCTOR: Ah. A city or perhaps a town. I wonder where we are? All I have
230,to do is get through that jungle and perhaps then I can get some help.
231,I must say it's a strange place to put a city. 
232,"(Bret steps into the Doctor's path, gun in hand.) "
233,BRET: Keep absolutely still. 
234,DOCTOR: What is it you want? 
235,BRET: The key. 
236,DOCTOR: What key? 
237,BRET: Give me that key or I'll kill you.
238,
239,[Tardis]
240,
241,(Steven has regained consciousness.) 
242,KATARINA: The Doctor will return very soon. He will get help. 
243,STEVEN: Where are we? 
244,KATARINA: On our way through the underworld. 
245,"STEVEN: What? Look, I don't understand. Vicki. Troy. Oh. You helped me"
246,when that Trojan 
247,KATARINA: Deep calm. You must rest. 
248,STEVEN: Did the Doctor bring you on board? 
249,KATARINA: Yes. We all make the journey together. 
250,STEVEN: Who are you? 
251,KATARINA: Katarina. I served as handmaid to the High Priestess
252,Cassandra. But you must rest. The Doctor will bring help. Don't ask any
253,more questions. 
254,"STEVEN: I, I want. "
255,(Steven passes out again as the doors open. Katarina turns in surprise
256,to see Bret enter the Tardis.) 
257,KATARINA: Did the Doctor sent you? 
258,BRET: That's right. The old man sent me. 
259,KATARINA: Have you bought help? 
260,"BRET: This is fantastic. You, what's your name? "
261,KATARINA: Katarina. Did the Doctor send you to cure the sickness? 
262,"BRET: Yes, but we must shut the doors first. The old man said you knew"
263,the switch. 
264,"KATARINA: Yes, here. "
265,"(As Katarina closes the doors, Bret continues to gaze around the"
266,outsized Tardis interior in amazement.) 
267,"BRET: What sort of craft is this? I've seen most, but nothing like"
268,this. From the outside it looked so small. How do you work this thing? 
269,KATARINA: Only the Doctor works his temple. 
270,BRET: His what? 
271,(Bret tries a few switches.) 
272,KATARINA: You must help Steven. 
273,"BRET: Yes, yes, of course I'll help Steven, but we must get back to"
274,"Earth first. I explained this to the old man, the, er, Doctor. "
275,(But the agent only succeeds in unknowingly activating the exterior
276,scanner.) 
277,"KATARINA: We can't go back to Earth, we've left it. "
278,BRET: That means we can get back? 
279,"(Coming round once more, Steven struggles to understand what's"
280,"happening. On the scanner, he can see the Doctor approaching outside.) "
281,"BRET: Katarina, are you sure you don't know how to work this? "
282,KATARINA: How could I know? It belongs to the Doctor. 
283,"BRET: The old man said this was no ordinary ship, and he was right."
284,
285,[Outside the Tardis]
286,
287,"(Outraged but unharmed, the Doctor has returned to"
288,the Tardis.) 
289,"DOCTOR: So, you'd use physical violence, would you? You don't know what"
290,"you've let yourself in for. So you've left the key in the door! Well,"
291,"well, that's the first big mistake, isn't it? Yes, very foolish. Very"
292,"foolish indeed, young man. Well now, it's brain, or brawn rather,"
293,"versus brain? I've got you beaten from the start, young man! "
294,[Tardis]
295,
296,(Bret is still trying to make sense of the Tardis
297,controls when Steven attacks him with a spanner.) 
298,KATARINA: Steven?
299,
300,[Outside the Tardis]
301,
302,"(Outside, the Doctor is distracted by a roaring"
303,overhead.) 
304,DOCTOR: I wonder if that spaceship has anything to do with that violent
305,"young man, or any connection with that city below. Yes, there are one"
306,or two questions I must have answered. 
307,[Reception hall]
308,
309,"(In the reception hall of the city, a Dalek reports"
310,to the Dalek Supreme.) 
311,DALEK 2: Control reports space vessel 1-11 in landing circuit. 
312,BLACK: Is all prepared? 
313,DALEK 2: Everything is ready. 
314,(The Black Dalek waits to greet the new arrival.)
315,
316,[Tardis]
317,
318,"(When Bret comes round he has a splitting headache,"
319,and finds himself unable to move.) 
320,DOCTOR: (chuckles) I doubt that you'll be able to get out of there in a
321,"hurry, my friend. "
322,BRET: What is it? 
323,"DOCTOR: Oh, it's a little invention of mine, I call it the magnetic"
324,chair. It has a forcefield strong enough to restrain a herd of
325,"elephants, so I wouldn't waste your energy trying to escape. You will"
326,stay there until I direct otherwise. 
327,"(The Doctor crosses over to Katarina, who is tending to Steven.) "
328,"DOCTOR: How is he, my dear? "
329,KATARINA: He's asleep. 
330,"DOCTOR: Yes. Oh, by the way, I've found a city. And just as I was about"
331,"to ascertain it's locale, that young ruffian set about me. "
332,KATARINA: Can you get help for Steven? 
333,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, I hope so. Just a minute. That young man, did he say"
334,anything? 
335,KATARINA: No. 
336,"DOCTOR: That's strange. Yes, I shall have to cross-examine him when I"
337,"get back. But don't worry, he's quite safe. Our guest is quite unable"
338,to move until I press that little switch at the back. So you're quite
339,"safe. Yes, he's quite harmless. Oh, and quite comfortable, I hope? "
340,[Kembel - Jungle]
341,
342,"(Leaving the Tardis, the Doctor struggles through"
343,"the thick jungle towards the city, oblivious to the dangers around him."
344,"Narrowly avoiding a Varga plant, he approaches the city walls and"
345,stumbles across a humanoid skeleton still covered in scraps of
346,clothing. The Doctor examines the body quickly.) 
347,"DOCTOR: Well, I wonder. Is this the solar system? "
348,(A spool of tape is lying discarded a few feet away.) 
349,DOCTOR: It's very strange. 
350,"(Pocketing the tape, the Doctor continues on his way.) "
351,"DOCTOR: Yes, strange indeed. Well. "

353,
354, (The spacecraft that the Doctor observed lands at
355,the Dalek spaceport.) 
356,DALEK 2: Space vessel 1-11 touch down completed. 
357,BLACK: Excellent. I will await our guest here. 
358,"(Concealing in the shadows by the landing area, the Doctor is horrified"
359,by what he sees.) 
360,DOCTOR: Daleks!
361,
362,[Tardis]
363,
364,(Steven's fever is getting worse. Katarina sits at
365,his side pressing a cool cloth to his brow.) 
366,"BRET: What's the matter with him? I said, what's the matter with him? "
367,KATARINA: He's sick. The Doctor says he's poisoned in the blood. 
368,BRET: There are some tablets in the pouch of my belt. Give him two. 
369,KATARINA: But you're an enemy. The Doctor's gone to get help. 
370,"BRET: He won't find any on this planet, believe me, so why not try the"
371,tablets? I hate to see anyone die through stupidity. 
372,KATARINA: I do not understand you. 
373,"BRET: For heaven's sake, girl, take the tablets and give them to him! "
374,KATARINA: All right. 
375,BRET: Now you're showing some sense. 
376,KATARINA: Here? 
377,BRET: Yes. It's all right. I won't harm you. This chair of the Doctor's
378,seems to be everything he claimed. All right. The tablets are in that
379,tube. 
380,KATARINA: Are these tablets? 
381,BRET: What do they look like? Take two and put them in his mouth. They
382,dissolve quickly and take effect almost immediately. Praise be that
383,you're not nursing me! It's all right. He'll be all right now. You can
384,leave him alone. 
385,"KATARINA: If you're wrong, the Doctor will be angry. I've disobeyed"
386,him. 
387,"BRET: If Steven, or whatever his name is, recovers, you'll be forgiven."
388,and if the Doctor gets back here soon. 
389,"(Glancing up at the scanner, Bret sees a Dalek enter the clearing.) "
390,BRET: (sotto) No!
391,
392,[Reception hall]
393,
394,(The Doctor continues to watch the Daleks in the
395,reception area.) 
396,DALEK 2: Our new ally approaches! 
397,"(The Dalek's visitor comes into sight. Tall, distinguished, stern yet"
398,almost benign looking with grey flecked beard and slightly oriental
399,"appearance, and eyebrows permanently arched quizzically, it is Mavic"
400,"Chen, Guardian of the Solar System.) "
401,BLACK: We welcome you as we welcome all allies of the Daleks. 
402,"CHEN: I am honoured to be here, and to be part of your plan to conquer"
403,Earth and all the planets in the solar system. 
404,(The Daleks lead Chen from the reception hall and into the city. With
405,"great urgency the Doctor edges away from the city walls. Half running,"
406,"half stumbling, he retraces his steps through the jungle back to the"
407,Tardis.)
408,
409,[Outside the Tardis]
410,
411,"(Reaching the edge of the clearing, the Doctor"
412,stops in his tracks. Something is wrong. The door of the Tardis is
413,"ajar, and as he watches, a Dalek appears from behind the ship, followed"
414,by two more.)

438,"writing left to right then right to left, at the head of the huge"
439,"table. Having missed the preliminary sessions of the conference, he's"
440,"spent the last hour studying transcripts of the meeting. As Chen reads,"
441,a humanoid creature wearing a full length black cloak and hood with
442,slanting gashes for eye holes sweeps down the entrance ramp into the

444,concentration disturbed.) 
445,"ZEPHON: Mavic Chen, Guardian of the Solar System? "
446,CHEN: Yes? 
447,"ZEPHON: I am Zephon, Master of the Fifth Galaxy. "
448,"CHEN: Of course. I had hoped to meet you once before, at the"
449,Intergalactic Conference of Andromeda. 
450,"ZEPHON: I did not attend, and now you know the reason. The Daleks held"
451,a separate council at the same time. None of us of the outer galaxies
452,went to yours. 
453,CHEN: Except Trantis. 
454,ZEPHON: We agreed to send a delegate in order that the conference
455,should not become suspicious. 
456,CHEN: I've been reading the reports on the previous meetings here. The
457,Daleks have evolved a most interesting plan. 
458,ZEPHON: We of the outer galaxies have contributed to it also. 
459,CHEN: Of course. But you must admit the Daleks have a genius for war. 
460,"ZEPHON: That is so. However, one thing surprises me. That you, Guardian"
461,"of the Solar System, have agreed to become one of us. "
462,"CHEN: Why the surprise? As you say, I am Guardian of the Solar System."
463,"But that is nothing more than a part, however influential, of one"
464,galaxy. Would you be satisfied with just a part of a galaxy? 
465,ZEPHON: The solar system is exceptional. In its power lies influences
466,far outside its own sphere. Surely by joining with the forces
467,"determined to destroy that power, you mark yourself up as a supreme"
468,traitor? 
469,CHEN: Traitor? (laughs) An archaic word for so advanced a man as
470,yourself. Considering that the planet Fisar and the Embodiment Gris
471,"have both, at different times, tried to depose you, do you still"
472,maintain that you're the mouthpiece for your own galaxy? 
473,"ZEPHON: I do, now that I am all-powerful with my position. "
474,CHEN: True. But then you do not understand the conflicting powers
475,within our solar system. Now let us go and take some air. This is
476,hardly the time or the place for so serious a discussion. 
477,ZEPHON: But first we must 
478,CHEN: Some air. 
479,"(Unaware that their conversation has been monitored, Chen and Zephon"
480,leave.

493,in the jungle.) 
494,STEVEN: Where's the Doctor? 
495,KATARINA: He will be here soon. 
496,STEVEN: I don't understand. Where are we? I can't think straight. 
497,"KATARINA: You must rest. The tablets I gave you have made you better,"
498,but you must still rest. 
499,STEVEN: Tablets? What's going on here? What are we doing out here in
500,the jungle? 
501,KATARINA: We had to leave the temple. The Tardis. The evil ones came. 
502,STEVEN: Evil ones? 
503,KATARINA: He called them the Daleks? 
504,STEVEN: Daleks! 
505,"(Still weakened by his fevers, Steven drifts back into unconsciousness."
506,Katarina watches over him with some concern when a small sound behind
507,her makes her turn. The bushes part and the Doctor emerges.) 
508,DOCTOR: Katarina! 
509,KATARINA: My lord. 
510,DOCTOR: Doctor. Doctor. What are you both doing here? 
511,KATARINA: The evil ones searched for us but Bret helped us. He said
512,they were evil. 
513,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, whoever this Bret is, he's quite right. The Daleks"
514,are evil things. 
515,KATARINA: Bret is the man you put in your magic chair. 
516,DOCTOR: What? That young ruffian? 
517,KATARINA: But he helped us. 
518,DOCTOR: And you released him? 
519,KATARINA: Was I not right to do so? When the evil ones came he said we
520,had to flee from your temple. 
521,"DOCTOR: Girl, my Tardis, child, my Tardis. Yes, you were right. I mean,"
522,he wasn't to know that you were quite safe away from the Daleks in
523,there. How is this young man? 
524,"STEVEN: I'll be all right in a minute or two, thanks, Doc. "
525,"DOCTOR: Good, good, good. "
526,"KATARINA: Bret says the time is four thousand, and he came here and"
527,only just got away from the evil ones. He gave Steven some white
528,"tablets, and he's almost well again. "
529,"DOCTOR: I see, I see. Yes, and I clamped him in that chair, and he's"
530,"the very fellow with the antitoxin. Well, young man, you'd better pull"
531,yourself together. We've got some work to do. 
532,"(Hiding in the bushes, looking down into the clearing towards the"
533,"Tardis, Bret watches as two more Daleks, both carrying flame-throwing"

540,"into a curtain of flame. Horrified, Bret scrambles to his feet and"
541,hurries back to the place he left Katarina and Steven. A little way
542,"off, the Doctor and his companions are as yet unaware of the danger"
543,they're in. Steven is struggling to get to his feet as Bret
544,approaches.) 
545,DOCTOR: Aren't you feeling better? 
546,"STEVEN: Look, Doctor, I think I can manage on my own. "
547,"DOCTOR: Carefully, carefully. Now, just rest for a minute. Take a few"
548,"deep breaths. Don't you try to run before you can walk, although you"
549,"might have to. Oh, it's Bret, isn't it? Yes, thank you. Tell me what's"
550,happening? 
551,"BRET: It's the Daleks, they're using flame guns. I think they're going"
552,to burn down the jungle. 
553,DOCTOR: Good gracious me. We must try to get back to the Tardis. We're
554,in grave danger here. 
555,"STEVEN: Doctor, don't you see? It's a trap. That's exactly what they"
556,want us to do. 
557,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, possibly, possibly. "
558,STEVEN: We can't act without thinking. 
559,DOCTOR: I never do and never shall. 
560,STEVEN: You were all set to go straight back to the Tardis. 
561,KATARINA: He said we should never have left it. 
562,"DOCTOR: Yes, you're quite right, my dear. It's the safest place. "
563,"STEVEN: Oh, yes. If the Daleks are waiting outside for us, it will be"
564,suicide. 
565,"DOCTOR: Oh, not necessarily, not. "
566,STEVEN: Who's going to play the scapegoat? 
567,KATARINA: Supposing Steven were right? 
568,"DOCTOR: Well, in this instance, child, he might be, but I know the"
569,Daleks. 
570,"STEVEN: So do I, Doctor. Look, I say we should stay here until we know"
571,exactly what they're going to do. 
572,DOCTOR: They could track us down at any time. 
573,"STEVEN: We'd hear them. I mean, the Mechanoids "
574,"DOCTOR: Oh, they were robots. "
575,STEVEN: So what? 
576,"DOCTOR: These are Daleks. Now you listen to me, young man, I am in"
577,charge of this situation. 
578,BRET: Sir! Will you shut up! At least that's stopped you arguing. 
579,DOCTOR: Well upon my soul. 
580,"BRET: Now, look here, I don't care what happens to you, but I have got"
581,to warn Earth. 
582,"DOCTOR: Yes, and you will have to do far more than that. If the Daleks"
583,"are doing something drastic, then we have to stop the Daleks. Now will"
584,"you shut up, sir? "
585,"(The Daleks spread out, relentlessly blasting at the undergrowth."

590,next.) 
591,"BRET: One, learn the Dalek plans. "
592,"DOCTOR: We know, young man. "
593,"BRET: And two, get the information back to Earth. "
594,"DOCTOR: Now just listen, listen, listen. Think back for a moment. Just"
595,"think back. If the Daleks were going to attack Earth, as you seem to"
596,"fear, then you must tell Earth to look back in the history of the year"
597,"2157, and that the Daleks are going to attack again. History will show"
598,how to deal with them. 
599,BRET: Who cares about history? 
600,DOCTOR: Now listen 
601,"STEVEN: I can smell smoke. Yes, look! "
602,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, you're quite right, young man. They're going to trap"
603,us. 
604,"KATARINA: Doctor, it's like the wall of fire. "
605,"DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no. Not quite, not quite, my dear. We've got to get"
606,out of here. Come on. This way. 
607,BRET: What? That's the way to the Dalek city.

614,CHEN: The magnificent power of the flame. Primitive but efficient. 
615,"ZEPHON: You, too, would have used ultrasonics? "
616,CHEN: If I had nothing better. The meeting must start soon. 
617,ZEPHON: You appear so keen to be a model delegate one might think you
618,are afraid of the Daleks. 
619,CHEN: A dangerous statement. Remember where you are. 
620,ZEPHON: Ha! The solar system is so far behind that it believes the
621,Daleks need to eavesdrop? 
622,CHEN: Of course not. 
623,"ZEPHON: The Daleks needed me. Without my help, they would never have"
624,got the co-operation of the masters of Celation and Beaus. We are on
625,equal terms. 
626,CHEN: Really? Three galaxies for the price of one. 
627,ZEPHON: I do not understand you. 
628,CHEN: Perhaps I'm the one of those who knows my place. Are you coming
629,in to take your seat? 
630,ZEPHON: They will not start the meeting without me. I feel like waiting

647,BRET: That one in the middle. That's from Earth. That's Mavic Chen's. 
648,DOCTOR: You know that spaceship? 
649,"BRET: Yes, I do. It belongs to the Guardian of the Solar System. "
650,"DOCTOR: Oh, then you'll know how to fly it? "
651,"BRET: Yes, of course I do, but that's "
652,"DOCTOR: Well, that's the one to go for, isn't it? "
653,BRET: I can't believe it. It doesn't make sense. 
654,"STEVEN: If you know how to use it, what's the worry? "
655,BRET: He's the Guardian. Don't you understand? 
656,"STEVEN: So what? We don't want him, just his ship. "
657,BRET: He's the ultimate head of the solar system. Now what's he doing
658,here with the Daleks? 
659,"STEVEN: That's what we'll have to find out, isn't it? "
660,"DOCTOR: Will you both be quiet, please! We're going to take that"

667,"forward, coming nearer to the Doctor's hiding place. Bret edges towards"
668,"the Doctor, signing as he approaches. The Doctor presses back against"

688,STEVEN: It's a good job we managed to find these vines. 
689,BRET: Now we can get to the ship. 
690,"DOCTOR: No, no. Not yet, not yet. Not until we find out exactly what"
691,"the Daleks are planning, and this may be our only chance. "
692,BRET: I don't understand. 
693,DOCTOR: I'm going to that conference. 
694,"STEVEN: Doctor, that's crazy. You can't go to their conference. "
695,"DOCTOR: Why not? If I wear his cloak, why not? "
696,"STEVEN: Should they find you, they'll kill you. "
697,"DOCTOR: Oh, nonsense. You three can take over the spaceship, and I can"

700,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, now don't worry, my child, don't worry. "

705,BRET: Where did you find it? 
706,"DOCTOR: Oh, in the jungle. Now I want you, I want you to give me enough"
707,time to get to that meeting and find out exactly what's going on. Then
708,I will head back to Chen's spaceship. 
709,BRET: And how long will that take? 
710,"DOCTOR: Well, I must leave that to your own judgment. If, of course,"
711,"you hear any kind of uproar, well then you'll have to get into the"
712,spaceship and go off without me. 
713,"BRET: Doctor, we can't leave you. "
714,"DOCTOR: Oh, nonsense, nonsense. Earth must be warned about the Daleks"

764,meeting. 
765,"CHEN: As your most recent ally, and the newest member to stand in this"
766,"great universal council, I am delighted to be able to make so"
767,significant a contribution to our conquest of the universe. I now
768,present you with the core of the time destructor. A full emm of

770,years to acquire even this amount. 
771,"TRANTIS: If it has taken so long for the solar system to acquire it,"
772,why was not one of us of the outer galaxies asked to provide it? 
773,"CHEN: As the Daleks know, taranium can only be found on one of the dead"
774,"planets of the solar system. Without this, the time destructor is"
775,"useless. All the plans made here could not succeed. I, Mavic Chen, give"
776,you the core of the time destructor.

874,"DOCTOR: Oh, he's one of them, my friend. By sacrificing the Solar"
875,"System, he hopes to gain more power. "
876,BRET: That's impossible! 
877,"DOCTOR: Oh no it isn't, no it isn't! Therefore we must get to Earth"
878,before him. 
879,KATARINA: But how can we return to Earth? We've already left it. 
880,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know, my dear, but this is not Earth as we see it."
881,Effectively it's something very different. 
882,BRET: What's the matter with this girl? I mean where's she from? 
883,STEVEN: Oh it's all right. She helped us in Troy. She doesn't really
884,understand. 
885,BRET: Troy? 
886,"STEVEN: Yes. Well come on, Doctor, what's so special about that box? "
887,"DOCTOR: Well, as I said before my boy, the Daleks' plans are utterly"
888,useless without this. 
889,STEVEN: Then we've won! 
890,"DOCTOR: Tut, tut, tut. Don't open it, please. "
891,STEVEN: Why not? 
892,DOCTOR: It will burn your eyes. You'll go totally blind! That is a full
893,emm of taranium. 
894,BRET: What? 
895,DOCTOR: Taranium. 
896,BRET: That can only be found on the planet Uranus. A full measure would
897,take years to mine! 
898,"DOCTOR: Fifty years, to be precise, and Mavic Chen has given this to"
899,the Daleks to complete one of the most evil weapons ever devised. Their
900,Time Destructor. 
901,[Conference room]
902,
903, BLACK: Representative Zephon! You deny that your
904,negligence caused the loss of the taranium core? 
905,"ZEPHON: Had the Daleks made full security arrangements, the invaders"
906,would not have reached the city. 
907,"CHEN: Had the Master of the Fifth Galaxy been less arrogant, he would"
908,have gone with me to the meeting. Instead he preferred to keep us all
909,waiting. 
910,ZEPHON: I believe the intruders came from the Solar System. 
911,CHEN: Did you see them? 
912,ZEPHON: No. 
913,CHEN: Did they speak and tell you so? 
914,ZEPHON: No. 
915,CHEN: Then your accusation is preposterous. 
916,ZEPHON: How is it the intruders knew that the taranium was here and
917,"that it was to be handed over, if they did not come from the Solar"
918,System? None of the others knew what was that Representative Mavic Chen
919,was bringing here. 
920,BLACK: Have you nothing to say? 
921,CHEN: This is absurd. Why should I arrange that fifty years be spent
922,secretly mining to acquire this mineral only to have it stolen? 
923,ZEPHON: The quest for power. Perhaps you wanted to use the core for
924,yourself! 
925,CHEN: How? Only the Daleks know how to assemble the Time Destructor. I
926,only provided the vital ingredient of the core. 
927,ZEPHON: I didn't know about the core. How could I? 
928,BLACK: You knew about the intruders. 
929,"ZEPHON: We all did. You were going to deal with them, or so you said. "
930,BLACK: Silence! It is agreed that you are guilty of negligence. 
931,"(Slowly, the other delegates line up behind Mavic Chen and the Dalek"
932,"Supreme. Zephon knows he's beaten, but offers one final argument.) "
933,"ZEPHON: If I go, the Masters of Celation and Beaus go with me. "
934,BLACK: You threaten our unity. 
935,ZEPHON: I have nothing to say. I will leave now. 
936,"(Disgusted, defeated, Zephon turns to leave for the spaceport and the"
937,"safety of his ship, but a group of Daleks move to block his path. Their"
938,intention is clear. Zephon's arrogance turns to terror as the Supreme
939,Dalek gives the order.) 
940,BLACK: Execute! 
941,(Zephon topples to the floor in a smoking heap.) 
942,[Dalek control room]
943,
944, BLACK: Where is the ship? 
945,DALEK: Course 707. It is approaching the influence of the planet
946,Desperus. 
947,BLACK: Prepare pursuit ships. Stand by Randomiser.

951,"(The Doctor, Bret and Steven are taking a look at"
952,the stolen taranium. They all wear visors to protect their eyes from
953,the intense glare of the core.) 
954,STEVEN: That is taranium. 
955,"DOCTOR: Yes, the rarest mineral in the universe. "
956,STEVEN: Funny. It makes your eyes feel strange even with these on. It's
957,like looking into the sun for too long. 
958,"DOCTOR: Oh, don't complain, young man. You're a very privileged person."
959,Do you realise very few people have seen this in this universe. 
960,"STEVEN: All right, Doctor. But now that we've got it what are we going"
961,to do with it? 
962,"DOCTOR: Well, for the moment, nothing. "
963,"STEVEN: That doesn't make sense. I mean, you said yourself that the"
964,Daleks have the most dangerous weapon ever devised. 
965,"DOCTOR: We have the taranium, so for the moment we do nothing. And by"
966,"doing nothing, we do everything. Do I make myself clear? "
967,"STEVEN: Come off it, Doctor. What's all that supposed to mean? "
968,"DOCTOR: Oh my dear young man, you ask so many questions. Look at"
969,"Katarina over there. She doesn't ask questions, she just looks and"
970,"learns. Now, why don't you try the same thing? You know I find all this"
971,"extremely fascinating. It's a little primitive of course, but it's"
972,still very fascinating. 
973,"STEVEN: Look Doctor, I'm sorry, but can't we do anything? "
974,"DOCTOR: Yes. Bret, can you find me something to play magnetic tape? "
975,"BRET: Yes, Doctor. Here. "
976,"DOCTOR: Well my dear fellow, that's magnificent. It's all so"
977,"convenient, isn't it. I'll play that tape that I gave you before I went"
978,to the Daleks' conference? 
979,STEVEN: What tape's that? 
980,"DOCTOR: Oh, I found a small tape beside a skeleton and it might be able"
981,"to tell us something. Katarina! Come over here, my child. Now, have a"
982,look at another wonder. 
983,KATARINA: Everything is so strange. This isn't like your Tardis. 
984,"DOCTOR: No, my dear, no. "
985,"STEVEN: Yes, but Doctor, surely, I mean, the Daleks aren't going to"
986,leave a tape around with their plans on it? 
987,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. Bret here was searching for someone and the"
988,"skeleton I found was humanoid. Well, whoever it was may learned"
989,something that we haven't. 
990,"BRET: Marc Cory! You found him? Well, Kurt and I searched that jungle"
991,but we could find no trace. 
992,"DOCTOR: Well, did you search that pairing twice? "
993,BRET: How do you mean? 
994,"DOCTOR: Well, it so happens that kind of jungle is apt to lead you back"
995,to the same place more than once. 
996,BRET: Yes but we were methodical or as methodical as the Daleks. 
997,DOCTOR: Oh yes no doubt you were and I suppose I was lucky. Now play
998,"the tape. Come along, come along, stop all this talking. "
999,"CORY : This is Marc Cory, Special Security Agent, reporting from"
1000,the planet Kembel. 
1001,BRET: You were right. 
1002,CORY : The Daleks are planning the complete destruction of the
1003,"Galaxy. Together with the powers of the outer galaxies, a war force is"
1004,being assembled and 
1005,STEVEN: That's all? 
1006,BRET: Poor Marc. He never got through. 
1007,DOCTOR: But we must. The Daleks will stop at anything to prevent us.

1021,he's very close to Chen. 
1022,"STEVEN: Yes, this chap Karlton, he may be part of the plan with the"
1023,Daleks.

1026,"(As the Dalek's Randomiser takes effect, the Spar lurches.) "
1027,DOCTOR: We're changing course.

1029,BRET: The steering boosters won't fire. I can't get her round. 
1030,STEVEN: Switch to manual control! 
1031,BRET: I can't. We're picking up speed. 
1032,DOCTOR: You know I believe we're approaching the gravitation point of
1033,that planet. 
1034,BRET: Desperus! 
1035,(Bret fights with the controls. His expression suggests this is not a
1036,planet he would choose to visit.) 
1037,DOCTOR: Has it any kind of atmosphere? 
1038,"BRET: Yes. But we can't get off there, we'll never be able to get off"
1039,again. 
1040,STEVEN: Why not? What's wrong with it? 
1041,BRET: Desperus is the penal planet of the Solar System. 
1042,"DOCTOR: Well, if it's one of your prison planets, surely there are"
1043,guards and warders there to help us. 
1044,BRET: They're aren't any. The only craft which stop there are prison
1045,"ships bringing other criminals. If we crash there, we'll be left there"
1046,to rot for the rest of our lives away. 
1047,DOCTOR: You must try to land softly somewhere.

1057,DALEK: Now under Dalek control. 
1058,BLACK: Reduce descent velocity. Vessel must make soft landing. 
1059,DALEK: I obey. 
1060,BLACK: Pursuit ships to stand by. 
1061,CHEN: A highly effective operation. May I congratulate you? 
1062,BLACK: Dalek technology is the most advanced in the Universe. 
1063,CHEN: You still haven't recovered the taranium. 
1064,BLACK: We shall. It is strange that the intruders took your space
1065,vessel. Perhaps they were indeed creatures from Earth. 
1066,"CHEN: My Spar was the last to arrive here, so consequently was in the"
1067,"best position to leave quickly. But to set your mind at rest, I will"
1068,return to Earth now and if I find that the intruders do come from
1069,"there, they will be dealt with quickly and without arousing any"
1070,suspicion. 
1071,BLACK: Very well. A vessel similar to your own craft will be put at
1072,your disposal.

1082,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid I do, only too well. "
1083,"STEVEN: Daleks? Well, it's some sort of remote control, I suppose. We'd"

1090,(Life on Desperus is primitive for those
1091,unfortunate enough to be sent there. In a dank gloomy cave three men
1092,sit around a rough table engaged in a power struggle that focuses on a
1093,crude knife stuck into the centre. After a brief and violent tussle
1094,"Bors is victorious, and tucks the knife into his belt, nodding coarsely"
1095,at two women in the corner.) 
1096,"BORS: It's mine again, and they stay where you are. "
1097,"GARGE: With the soft life you lead, I'll be able to beat you one day. "
1098,BORS: Out on guard! 
1099,GARGE: Why is it always me? 
1100,BORS: I'm the leader. I have the knife. Do you want to argue about it? 
1101,"(Garge looks sourly at Bors then, grumbling to himself picks up a crude"
1102,"club and leaves the cave. His leadership confirmed for now, Bors"
1103,"settles down to sleep. Outside, winged creatures wheel and turn in the"
1104,darkening sky as Garge settles down to guard duty. Soon all is quiet.
1105,"Kirksen, who is still smarting from his earlier humiliation, cannot"
1106,"sleep, but when he's sure that Bors is asleep, Kirksen edges around the"
1107,cave stealthily crawling across the floor to where Bors is lying. He
1108,reaches for the knife in Bors' belt. Bors is instantly awake and grabs
1109,Kirksen roughly by the wrist.) 
1110,"BORS: And you can build up the fire. Kirksen, like the knife, would"
1111,"you? Then you'd be leader. You could tell Garge what to do, like I do."
1112,You can tell me what to do! 
1113,KIRKSEN: I'll get it next time! 
1114,"BORS: Who knows, perhaps you will. Now, get out and get the fuel. "
1115,(Kirksen points to the sleeping women.) 
1116,KIRKSEN: Why don't you send one of them? 
1117,BORS: Get it! 
1118,(Garge has spotted the spacecraft overhead) 
1119,"BORS: I can hear it, now get out before one of the new lot come here"
1120,and take over our place.

1122,it before. 
1123,BORS: Where's it landing? 
1124,GARGE: In the swamp by the look of things. 
1125,KIRKSEN: It's a strange ship. We can kill the crew and take over. 
1126,BORS: Possibly. 
1127,KIRKSEN: We can use it to get away. 
1128,BORS: It may be a crash landing. 
1129,KIRKSEN: But you can kill the crew with your knife.

1131,seen it too. Now on your way!

1290," DOCTOR: Remember, Chen will have allies on earth"
1291,and 
1292,KIRKSEN: Keep back! 
1293,(Kirksen holds Katarina in a vice-like grip.) 
1294,DOCTOR: Who are you? What do you want? Release that girl! 
1295,KIRKSEN: Never mind! Who's in charge of this thing? Answer me! 
1296,BRET: I am. 
1297,KIRKSEN: Where are you heading? 
1298,BRET: Earth. 
1299,KIRKSEN: Change course. Change it! 
1300,BRET: Where to? 
1301,KIRKSEN: Not Earth. Go to the planet Kembel. 
1302,DOCTOR: Kembel! 
1303,KIRKSEN: Shut up and do as I say! 
1304,"BRET: Kembel's deserted, man. It's as bad as Desperus. "
1305,KIRKSEN: Nowhere's as bad as Desperus! 
1306,STEVEN: The Daleks are on Kembel! 
1307,KIRKSEN: So? 
1308,"DOCTOR: The Daleks are no help, We're going back to Earth. "
1309,"KIRKSEN: Then I shall be sent back to the Devil's planet! No, whoever"
1310,"the Daleks are, they'll help me. "
1311,STEVEN: You don't know about them. 
1312,KIRKSEN: I said go to Kembel! Kembel! 
1313,[Dalek Control centre]
1314,
1315,(The Daleks receive news from Desperus.) 
1316,DALEK : Only slight damage was sustained. We are ready to continue
1317,pursuit of Earth vessel. 
1318,BLACK: What is course of Earth vessel? 
1319,DALEK: Back on course 707 heading for Earth. 
1320,BLACK: Contact Mavic Chen through secret communication red. He must
1321,recapture the taranium and exterminate creatures who took it. 
1322,DALEK: I obey. 
1323,"BLACK: Pursuit vessel, return to base. "
1324,DALEK : We obey. 
1325,(The Supreme severs the radio link.) 
1326,BLACK: Destroy pursuit ship. They have failed in their mission. We will
1327,not tolerate mistakes.

1330,
1331,(Bret and Steven work at the navigation controls.) 
1332,DOCTOR: We're changing course. Now release that girl. 
1333,KIRKSEN: Do you think I'm a fool? 
1334,STEVEN: Course is changed. We're heading for Kembel. 
1335,KIRKSEN: It doesn't feel as if we've changed. 
1336,"BRET: Well, look up at the screen and you'll see. "
1337,"(Steven launches himself at Kirksen, who shoves him away and drags"
1338,Katarina into the airlock.) 
1339,STEVEN: Well open the door from the control panel. I'll rush him! 
1340,DOCTOR: The girl will be dead before the door's half open! Can we talk
1341,to him in there? 
1342,"BRET: Yes, I've turned on the talkback. "
1343,"DOCTOR: Let's try a little bluff. Now, then! Listen to me, whoever you"
1344,"are. Bring that girl in here, or we will press a button and you will go"
1345,outside the door into space. 
1346,KIRKSEN: Then the girl dies too. If you open the outside door I'll
1347,press the inner release and then we'll all be dead! 
1348,BRET: We can't seem to get through to him. He's crazy. 
1349,DOCTOR: We've got to get Katarina out of there! 
1350,(Bret cuts off the audio link to the airlock.) 
1351,STEVEN: Stop that! Turn the talkback on again! 
1352,BRET: There's no point. 
1353,"STEVEN: Turn it on again, before he really hurts her. "
1354,"BRET: Look, he can't kill her or he hasn't a hostage. "
1355,(Steven turns the talkback back on and shouts) 
1356,STEVEN: You animal! 
1357,KIRKSEN: Now that's just for starters. Do as I say! 
1358,DOCTOR: Change course! 
1359,"KIRKSEN: Now, that's more like it! "
1360,DOCTOR: Take him back to Kembel. Take him back to Kembel! Let the
1361,Daleks deal with him. 
1362,"STEVEN: Yes, and us. "
1363,"DOCTOR: Don't worry, dear boy, We'll find a way out. "
1364,(Katarina has been screaming almost all the time.) 
1365,KIRKSEN: Stop that or you're dead! 
1366,BRET: I can't sacrifice everything for the sake of that one girl. 
1367,"STEVEN: Listen! Without us you wouldn't have got off Kembel at all, and"
1368,nothing would be worth bothering about! 
1369,"BRET: All right, so we all go back together. But without me, I doubt"
1370,that you would have got this far either. 
1371,"STEVEN: Yes, all right, but I won't let you hurt Katarina. We'll head"
1372,back for Kembel as the Doctor says. On the way we may find a way to get
1373,her out of there. 
1374,"(Katarina pulls free of Kirksen, clawing at his face with one hand and"
1375,reaching for the door controls with the other.) 
1376,KIRKSEN: You won't. 
1377,"STEVEN: No, not that one! Katarina! "
1378,"(The outer doors open, and Katarina and Kirksen are sucked out to die"
1379,in the
1380,vacuum of space.) 
1381,STEVEN: Katarina! Too late. 
1382,(There's a stunned silence aboard the Spar as the crew try to
1383,comprehend what has happened.) 
1384,"STEVEN: She pressed the wrong button, Doctor. "
1385,"DOCTOR: She may have wanted to, dear boy. She wanted to save our lives."
1386,
1387,BRET: It must have been quick. 
1388,DOCTOR: I hope she's reached her Place of Perfection. 
1389,"STEVEN: Yes, but not that way. "
1390,DOCTOR: She didn't understand. She couldn't understand. She wanted to
1391,save our lives and perhaps the lives of all the other beings of the
1392,"Solar System. I hope she's found her Perfection. Oh, how I shall always"
1393,"remember her as one of the Daughters of the Gods. Yes, as one of the"
1394,Daughters of the Gods.

1396,
1397," TRANTIS: Dalek Supreme, you have failed to get"
1398,back the core of the time destructor. 
1399,BLACK: We shall get it back. 
1400,TRANTIS: You show too much trust in Mavic Chen. 
1401,BLACK: Mavic Chen is hungry for power. We have offered him more power
1402,than he has ever thought of. He will return to us the taranium core. 
1403,TRANTIS: Supposing he fails? 
1404,BLACK: He will not. He had been given instructions. 
1405,TRANTIS: What instructions? 
1406,BLACK: It is not necessary for you to know. 
1407,"TRANTIS: As Representative of the largest of the outer galaxies, I have"
1408,the right to know! 
1409,BLACK: Representative Trantis. The Daleks will not fail and neither
1410,will any of its' allies. If anything tries to stop us we will destroy
1411,it. Nothing will be allowed to stand in the way of our plan to conquer
1412,the Universe! 
1413,[Spar ship]
1414,
1415,(The mood is sombre. Bret and Steven are at the
1416,controls as it approaches Earth.) 
1417,"DOCTOR: Judging by the position of those planets, we shall land quite"
1418,soon. 
1419,BRET: Yes and that's the problem. It won't be easy. 
1420,"DOCTOR: Oh, haven't we sufficient powerdrive to land safely? "
1421,"BRET: Yes but we can't land at the main landing area. Remember, this is"
1422,Chen's space vessel. 
1423,"DOCTOR: Yes, you've got a point there. Where can we land? "
1424,BRET: An experimental plant a little way off from Central City. I have
1425,a friend there I think will help us. 
1426,[Chen's office]
1427,
1428,"(On his return to Earth, Chen has a meeting in his"
1429,"office with Lizan, and Karlton the Head of the Special Security"
1430,Service.) 
1431,CHEN: So that's our traitor. 
1432,"LIZAN: Yes, Bret Vyon. Bred on Mars Colony 16. Joined Space Security"
1433,Service 3990. Gained First Rank 3995. Gained Second Rank 3998. 
1434,CHEN: You have a good memory. 
1435,"LIZAN: Thank you, Guardian. "
1436,CHEN: And he looks like that? 
1437,"LIZAN: Exactly like that. How can he look otherwise? Guardian, have you"
1438,no faith in computerised data? 
1439,CHEN: Every faith. But this information is vital. The man is dangerous
1440,and must be caught. I would hate there to be any mistake. 
1441,LIZAN: A mistake is impossible. Our computer network contains precise
1442,"chemical details of every man, woman, and child within our Solar"
1443,System. 
1444,CHEN: There are forty billion people in the Solar System. Doesn't that
1445,provide some scope for error? 
1446,LIZAN: There is no scope for error. 
1447,"CHEN: Very well, have it sent out to all stations. Now, what about"
1448,"Gantry, the other traitor? "
1449,LIZAN: We're working on his identity projection now. It should be ready
1450,shortly. 
1451,"KARLTON: Since Vyon is in command, I gave priority to his projection. "
1452,CHEN: Excellent. Excellent! Vyon and Gantry were the two who never
1453,"reported in from the planet, Kembel, am I right? "
1454,"LIZAN: Yes, Guardian. "
1455,CHEN: Then they are the two who took over my Spar. It's possible they
1456,may be in association with some other creatures. But we don't know
1457,where from. 
1458,"KARLTON: When you catch Vyon and Gantry, you catch them, too. "
1459,(Chen turns to gaze benevolently at Lizan.) 
1460,CHEN: You've done well. I want all Space Security agents called back to
1461,"Earth. If the traitors are not caught at the landing zone, then Central"
1462,City must be cordoned off until they are found. And Lizan! They will be
1463,killed on sight. Give out the instructions. 
1464,"LIZAN: Yes, Guardian. "
1465,"(Lizan leaves the office, delighted to have been of service to the"
1466,leader she so admires. Chen turns to Karlton.) 
1467,"CHEN: I think that takes care of that. You know, Karlton, some of your"
1468,agents are getting too good. We don't want to spoil things for
1469,ourselves at this stage. 
1470,KARLTON: They won't. I've already insisted that all future operations
1471,shall be cleared with me before they're begun. 
1472,"CHEN: If you'd done that in the first place, we wouldn't be in this"
1473,spot. 
1474,KARLTON: Cory's mission was one that he kept to himself. It was done
1475,without official sanction of any kind. 
1476,CHEN: And you could hardly have stopped the others after his distress
1477,signal. You must do better than that. I would hate to have to lose you.
1478,
1479,KARLTON: You know you can trust me. 
1480,[Spar ship]
1481,
1482,(Steven and the Doctor are strapped into their
1483,seats in preparation for landing.) 
1484,BRET: The drive force is very weak. 
1485,DOCTOR: But can we land? 
1486,"BRET: Yes, but I don't know what would happen. The pull is too hard. "
1487,STEVEN: We can't crash now! 
1488,BRET: I'm afraid I may not be able to help it. 
1489,"STEVEN: Yes, well remember, Bret, we got some valuable cargo on board. "
1490,"BRET: What, the taranium? "
1491,STEVEN: And the Doctor. 
1492,"DOCTOR: Yes, I heard that. Now, don't concern yourselves over me. I can"
1493,look after myself. The most important factor is this taranium. 
1494,"BRET: Right, stand by. "

1496,
1497,(Contemplating the huge map of the Universe that
1498,"dominates the wall of his office, Chen almost forgets that Karlton is"
1499,still in the room with him. His plans for universal domination are now
1500,at risk. Years of careful scheming sabotaged by the theft of the
1501,taranium.) 
1502,CHEN: Only because of the taranium am I on the council. 
1503,KARLTON: It will be returned. 
1504,"CHEN: It's got to be. I want that position, right beside the Daleks."
1505,I'll govern the Universe! 
1506,KARLTON: Surely Trantis will be first after the Daleks? 
1507,CHEN: Trantis? Trantis! They don't like him. Agreed that his is the
1508,"largest galaxy, but he's already demanding too much say in what goes"
1509,"on. They'll want him out of the way now, and I have a plan which may"
1510,"help them to achieve just that. Then it'll be me, Mavic Chen, who'll be"
1511,next in line. 
1512,KARLTON: And I will be there behind you. 
1513,CHEN: Of course. 
1514,KARLTON: Of course. 
1515,CHEN: Is your Special Force dealing with Bret Vyon? 
1516,KARLTON: Not completely. I thought it wiser to use some of the ordinary
1517,security men. 
1518,"CHEN: Hmm, very good. We'll need your men next time. Who's in command? "
1519,KARLTON: Kingdom. 
1520,"CHEN: Kingdom? Ruthless, hard, efficient. And does exactly as ordered. "
1521,KARLTON: Quite. 
1522,(Karlton picks up the communications receiver on the desk and listens
1523,for a moment.) 
1524,KARLTON: Ah ha! I see. Carry out emergency plan B. The traitors have
1525,arrived. 
1526,CHEN: Good. 
1527,KARLTON: But not at the landing area.

1544,"(Kingdom enters. Sara Kingdom. She is strikingly attractive, dressed in"
1545,"the black cat suit of all SSS operatives but she is unsmiling, her"
1546,blue-grey eyes lacking any warmth. Here is direct descendant of

1548,CHEN: You know what's happened? 
1549,SARA: Yes. 
1550,CHEN: Do you know how many there are? 
1551,SARA: Three. Bret Vyon and two strangers. They look as though they
1552,could come from Earth but are oddly dressed. None of them can leave the
1553,plant. 
1554,CHEN: Good. 
1555,SARA: They're in the main block. I'm going to capture them myself. 
1556,"CHEN: Before you do that, there is something you have to know. "

1558,
1559,(Steven is restlessly pacing around the room as
1560,they wait.) 
1561,"STEVEN: Look, where on earth is this Daxtar? "
1562,BRET: He shouldn't be long. 
1563,DOCTOR: And I think we're just wasting valuable time sitting about here
1564,"waiting for this man, Baxter or Daxtor or whatever he call himself. "
1565,"BRET: Doctor, Daxtar is in a position to help us. "
1566,DOCTOR: Surely everyone must know that Chen's space-ship has
1567,crash-landed only a short distance away from here. There must be
1568,hundreds of people looking for us! 
1569,"BRET: Doctor, there are very few people allowed near this place, it's a"
1570,"restricted area. Look, don't you understand that Chen will probably"
1571,have returned to Earth by this time. He'd have realised that I was the
1572,man on the planet Kembel. I expect we're wanted men by this time. 
1573,"DOCTOR: But this is an experimental plant, There's no scientists, no"
1574,"staff, nobody! We might just as well have landed ourselves on an empty"
1575,planet. What on Earth is happening? 
1576,"BRET: Doctor, I don't know anymore than you do. "
1577,"DOCTOR: Has it occurred to you, by any chance, that we might have"
1578,deliberately walked into an ambush? 
1579,STEVEN: What's the point in standing here just waiting to be caught? 
1580,BRET: Because Daxtar is the only man who will believe our story. 
1581,DAXTAR: What story? 
1582,(The three turn to see Daxtar in the doorway)
1583,
1584,[Chen's office]
1585,
1586, CHEN: So you will understand that it's absolutely
1587,essential that this emm of taranium is returned to me. 
1588,SARA: Of course. Every precaution for it's safety will be taken. 
1589,CHEN: Good. See to it. 
1590,"(Sara leaves the room, already focused singlemindedly on her mission."
1591,Karlton watches her go then turns to Chen.) 
1592,KARLTON: She actually believed you. 
1593,CHEN: Of course. 
1594,KARLTON: I thought for a moment you were really going to tell her about
1595,the Daleks. 
1596,"CHEN: Oh, come. We need that taranium back, but we can't allow any more"
1597,people to know the plan. 
1598,"KARLTON: I was watching her all the time. She never doubted anything,"
1599,even momentarily. 
1600,CHEN: A good security agent. A heroic war cry to apparently peaceful
1601,ends is one of the greatest weapons a politician has. 
1602,[Daxtar's office]
1603,
1604, DAXTAR: Mavic Chen? The Daleks? I can't believe
1605,it. 
1606,BRET: The Doctor saw it. 
1607,DOCTOR: Quite true. And then he gave a rather pompous speech of
1608,self-satisfaction and handed over the core of the Time Destructor to
1609,the Daleks. 
1610,STEVEN: They intend to capture or destroy the Solar System and Chen is
1611,helping them. 
1612,DAXTAR: But why? 
1613,DOCTOR: A lust for more power than he already has. Universal power. 
1614,DAXTAR: It's incredible. 
1615,STEVEN: Oh don't worry about it's incredibility. We got to do something
1616,to stop him. 
1617,"DOCTOR: Yes, quite so. So whatever plans you have, it's essential that"
1618,Steven and I return to the planet Kembel. I want to recover something
1619,of unique value. 
1620,DAXTAR: You didn't leave the taranium there? 
1621,"STEVEN: No, no, the Doctor has it. "
1622,DAXTAR: Good. That gives us a little time. 
1623,BRET: Very little. We've got to move fast. 
1624,DAXTAR: Of course. We must get down to the Security buildings at once.
1625,The planets must all be alerted. A combined Task Force must be sent off
1626,to Kembel immediately. 
1627,DOCTOR: No. 
1628,"BRET: What do you mean, Doctor? What are you playing at? "
1629,DOCTOR: I suggest you ask Daxtar what he is playing at. 
1630,"DAXTAR: I don't understand. Look, this situation must be dealt with at"
1631,once. 
1632,DOCTOR: What price is Mavic Chen paying you for your treachery? 
1633,BRET: Treachery? I've known this man all my life. He's no traitor. 
1634,DOCTOR: Long acquaintance is no guarantee for honesty. Ask him. Ask him
1635,how he came to know that the core of their Time Destructor was
1636,taranium! 
1637,DAXTAR: Don't be so ridiculous! One of you mentioned it when you were
1638,"telling me. Why you yourself, mentioned it when you said that Chen"
1639,handed the stuff over. 
1640,"DOCTOR: I did not, sir. How long have you been in this conspiracy? "
1641,DAXTAR: What conspiracy? You're making a stupid mistake! 
1642,"DOCTOR: There is you, and Chen, and how many of the others? Or what"
1643,others are involved? 
1644,"DAXTAR: Look Bret, you've known me for many years. You know I wouldn't"
1645,be mixed up in anything like this! 
1646,BRET: How did you know about the taranium? 
1647,"DAXTAR: He told me. For heaven's sake, you must have heard him. You"
1648,too! 
1649,BRET: Traitor! 
1650,"(Bret draws his gun and Daxtar backs away. Hesitating but a moment,"
1651,Bret pulls the trigger. Daxtar screams and falls dead. The Doctor looks
1652,"on, appalled.) "

1662,returning with it to land here in two Earth days. 
1663,BLACK: Have the fugitives been exterminated? 
1664,DALEK: The report did not say. But it is believed that they come from
1665,the tenth galaxy under the leadership of Trantis. 
1666,TRANTIS: That is not true. It is a plot by Mavic Chen to discredit me.
1667,He is jealous of my power in the outer galaxies. 
1668,BLACK: We shall see. Has the report been confirmed? 
1669,DALEK: No. It was a suspicion by the Earth people. 
1670,TRANTIS: It is Chen! He is trying to undermine the balance of the
1671,Galactic Council. 
1672,BLACK: When Mavic Chen returns we shall discover the truth. By then
1673,those who stole the taranium will have been identified and
1674,exterminated!

1678,(Bret is working hard to convince the others that

1680,BRET: I'm going to get into the Security building and send out the
1681,warning myself. 
1682,DOCTOR: And how do you propose to do that? 
1683,"STEVEN: Yes, we're probably being searched for now by other friends of"
1684,Chen. I mean Daxtar clearly knew about the disappearance of the
1685,taranium. 
1686,"DOCTOR: Yes, possibly. We filled in the story long before he gave"
1687,himself away. 
1688,"BRET: I could try to bluff my way out. Well, it's worth a try. Well you"
1689,haven't thought of a better idea. 
1690,"DOCTOR: Yes, possible. If you hadn't killed Daxtar of course there"

1904,CHEN: It's nearer Kembel then Earth is. But what help is that? 
1905,KARLTON: Tell the Daleks that you trapped the fugitives in the cellular
1906,projector and sent them to Mira on purpose. 
1907,CHEN: You're mad. 
1908,KARLTON: Am I? It was a safety measure. Unwelcome attention was being
1909,paid to the fugitives so you send them to Mira on purpose. 
1910,CHEN: Ah. We could attribute it to a too-efficient security system.
1911,It'll show conclusively that we're completely allied to the Daleks.
1912,They would trust us the more. 
1913,KARLTON: Exactly. 
1914,CHEN: Wait. How do we know that the taranium wasn't destroyed on the
1915,way. 
1916,KARLTON: We don't. 
1917,CHEN: But 
1918,KARLTON: No buts. The only reason that you as Guardian of the Solar
1919,System were admitted to the Universal Council was because of our
1920,superior knowledge of mineralogy. Without us they cannot get taranium.

2129,"DOCTOR: I'm afraid, my friends, the Daleks have won."

2135,
2136,(The Doctor leads the others out of the cave.) 
2137,DALEK: You will hand over the taranium core. 
2138,"DOCTOR: If I do, what guarantee is there that you won't fire your guns"
2139,afterwards? 
2140,DALEK: There is no guarantee. 
2141,DALEK 2: Seismic detector shows that the object that he is carrying is
2142,the taranium! 
2143,DALEK: You will surrender it! 
2144,SARA: He will not! 
2145,DALEK: Silence! You will not speak! 
2146,"DOCTOR: You dare not fire, because of this taranium! To end this"
2147,"stalemate, may I suggest "
2148,DALEK: There will no more discussion. The core is to be handed over.
2149,Re-form line. Prepare to exterminate them. What is that noise?? 
2150,DALEK 2: The invisible creatures are attacking in force! 
2151,DALEK: Patrol alert! Patrol Alert! Annihilate them! Annihilate them! 
2152,"(The Visians surge forward to attack from all sides, bellowing with"
2153,fury as they smash at the Daleks with rocks and sticks. The Daleks
2154,swing round to counterattack blasting indiscriminately at their
2155,invisible assailants. Those creatures caught in the cross-fire become
2156,"briefly visible before they die. Despite the Visians spirited attack,"
2157,"the Daleks sustain little damage. Whilst the battle rages on, the"
2158,Doctor and his companions
2159,seize the opportunity to make their escape.) 
2160,"DOCTOR: There's a good boy, keep going! "
2161,(A lone Dalek cut off from the rest of the patrol becomes the focus of
2162,the Visian fury. The Dalek is helpless as the unseen creatures shove it
2163,into a bubbling mud pool where it sinks slowly under the surface.
2164,"Ultimately however, the battle is short and the result predictable."
2165,Forming a tight protective circle the remaining Daleks continue to fire
2166,"in all directions until they have decimated their attackers. Very soon,"
2167,the few surviving Visians flee back into the forest.) 
2168,DALEK 2: The invisible creatures have been exterminated. 
2169,DALEK: Search for the fugitives. They must not escape. 
2170,DALEKS: We obey!
2171,
2172,[Dalek Control centre]
2173,
2174, DALEK: Communication received from the planet
2175,Mira. 
2176,BLACK: Are the fugitives still evading capture? 
2177,DALEK: Yes. There has been no further contact. Reinforcements can be
2178,dispatched. 
2179,BLACK: Our force already there is sufficient for the task. Contact them
2180,and order that the taranium is to be recovered. Failure will not be
2181,tolerated!
2182,
2183,[Outside the Dalek pursuit ship]
2184,
2185,"(The Doctor, Steven and Sara have discovered the"
2186,"Dalek pursuit ship in the swamp, and make plans to steal it and escape"
2187,"from Mira. They stand some distance from the ship, staring up at the"
2188,solitary Dalek stationed at the top of the loading ramp.) 
2189,DOCTOR: There's only one guard. Now you know what to do? 
2190,STEVEN: Yes. 
2191,(The Doctor moves away.) 
2192,SARA: It will never work. 
2193,STEVEN: It will. It's got to. 
2194,SARA: The other Daleks will be back here before he can get started. 
2195,"STEVEN: Why should they? They're out looking for us, they won't expect"
2196,us to come back here. 
2197,"SARA: Look, they're not complete fools. They know we got to get off"
2198,Mira and that their ship is our only chance. 
2199,"STEVEN: Don't worry. Like most of the Doctor's plans, this one's"
2200,simple. It won't take long. 
2201,"SARA: Well, why doesn't he get started then? "
2202,"STEVEN: Give him time. He's got to get round there. Look, you must"
2203,learn to trust him. He's had dealing with the Daleks before. 
2204,SARA: I have no choice. Let's hope you're right. 
2205,STEVEN: He should be in position by now. Come on. 
2206,"(As Steven and Sara edge closer to the ship, the Doctor walks from the"
2207,trees into full view of the Dalek guard.) 
2208,GUARD: Remain where you are. 
2209,DOCTOR: I certainly will. I've come to give myself up. 
2210,DALEK GUARD: Do you have the taranium? 
2211,"DOCTOR: I have. I realise of course that I am no match for the Daleks,"
2212,"so if I hand it over, will you help me and my friends to get away from"
2213,this planet? 
2214,DALEK GUARD: Where are the others? 
2215,"DOCTOR: Oh, they will come when I call them. The taranium. Shall I give"
2216,it to you or would you prefer me to hand it to you in your ship? 
2217,DALEK GUARD: You will wait there until the patrol returns. The others
2218,are to join you. If you try to escape you 
2219,"DOCTOR: Escape! Oh, my tin friend. Never. You mustn't forget that I"
2220,came here and surrendered of my own free will. 
2221,(Steven leaps forward and grinds a handful of mud into the Dalek's
2222,eye-stalk.) 
2223,"DALEK GUARD: Help, help, loss of vision, loss of vision, am under"
2224,attack! Am under attack! Patrol alert! Patrol alert! 
2225,(The Doctor and the others dash up the ramp into the Dalek ship. The
2226,"guard fires blindly, nearly wiping out the returning Dalek patrol.) "
2227,DALEK: Cease firing before we sustain damage. Report! 
2228,DALEK GUARD: The fugitives boarded the Pursuit ship!
2229,
2230,[Dalek Pursuit ship]
2231,
2232,DALEK : Alert all patrols. Alert all patrols. 
2233,"SARA: Can you work it, Doctor? "
2234,DOCTOR: Oh don't worry my dear. I'm quite accustomed to this Dalek
2235,technique. Close the hatches please. 
2236,DALEK : Surround pursuit ship. Surround pursuit ship. 
2237,DALEKS : We obey. 
2238,SARA: Doors are not closing! Vacuum-lock reading 2.24. 
2239,DOCTOR: The power build-up is far too slow. Feed in that extra energy. 
2240,SARA: 3.82 rising. 
2241,DALEK : Avoid firing in area of taranium. 
2242,"DOCTOR: It should activate at five, zero, zero. "
2243,DALEKS : We obey. 
2244,STEVEN: They're forming up to attack. 
2245,SARA: 4.32 still rising. 
2246,"DALEK : Form up, attack formation. "
2247,DOCTOR: Splendid! 
2248,DALEK 2 : Prepare to board the ship! 
2249,DALEK : Exterminate them! Exterminate them! 
2250,STEVEN: That was close. It was too close! 
2251,DOCTOR: Autogiro. Giro dynamo. 
2252,"SARA: Coding nine, two. Red, blue, blue. "
2253,DOCTOR: Discharge. 
2254,"SARA: Coding one, zero, zero. All blue reading. Take off now! "
2255,DOCTOR: Splendid! Hold tight!

2257,
2258,[Dalek Control centre]
2259,
2260," BLACK: Mavic Chen, you have failed in your task. "
2261,CHEN: Failed? Is this my greeting? I agree that my mission was to
2262,return to Earth and recover the taranium. This I have not done. 
2263,BLACK: Failure will not be tolerated! 
2264,CHEN: But I did notify you of the fugitives' whereabouts. The planet
2265,Mira. There the vital core can be taken from them without suspicion.
2266,Their presence on Earth was a constant danger! At anytime they could
2267,have contacted forces unsympathetic to our plans. 
2268,BLACK: You make your incompetence sound like an achievement. 
2269,"CHEN: Incompetence now, is it? You forget that the original blunder was"
2270,not of my doing. I journeyed to and from Earth to correct a failing
2271,your security force should have dealt with. The core was stolen from
2272,here. My actions have brought about a situation which will allow you to
2273,"recover the missing taranium easily and simply. If that is a failure,"
2274,then I have failed. 
2275,BLACK: Report. 
2276,DALEK: The fugitives have stolen our pursuit ship and left the planet
2277,Mira. 
2278,BLACK: Stolen! Left the planet Mira! Is their course being computed? 
2279,DALEK: It is. 
2280,BLACK: What news of our force? 
2281,DALEK: They are stranded on the planet and under constant attack from
2282,the invisible creatures that inhibit it. 
2283,BLACK: Dispatch a rescue ship to their aid. They will be dealt with on
2284,"their return. Meanwhile, I will personally supervise recovery of the"
2285,core. 
2286,DALEK: I obey. 
2287,"CHEN: And you had the audacity to accuse me, Mavic Chen, of"
2288,incompetence. 
2289,BLACK: It is 
2290,CHEN: A Dalek ship stolen? 
2291,BLACK: It is not 
2292,CHEN: Really? 
2293,BLACK: It is not an emergency! 
2294,CHEN: No. More like a catastrophe! 
2295,"BLACK: They may believe that they have successfully escaped from us,"
2296,"but we, the Daleks, are still in command!"
2297,
2298,[Dalek Pursuit ship]
2299,
2300,(The Doctor makes a full examination of the glowing
2301,"taranium core, taking measurements and writing notes.) "
2302,"STEVEN: Will it work, Doctor? "
2303,"DOCTOR: No, course it won't, my dear boy. That's the whole point. "
2304,STEVEN: I mean your plan. 
2305,"DOCTOR: No, we shall have to make a copy. A copy so exact that we can"
2306,"deceive the Daleks. They'll still want this taranium back, you know."
2307,They won't rest until they get it. 
2308,"STEVEN: Yes, but suppose "
2309,SARA: There isn't time to suppose. I'm sure the Doctor can copy it well
2310,enough. 
2311,"DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, thank you my dear, thank you. I'll have a good"
2312,try. And I think that will give us sufficient breathing space. What's
2313,that? 
2314,SARA: We're changing course. We're moving away on a selected route. 
2315,"DOCTOR: Good gracious, we're on the course for the planet Kembel. You"
2316,"know, I'm very much afraid that we're under the Dalek influence. "
2317,(Steven notices an auxiliary unit attached to the main controls.) 
2318,STEVEN: It's obviously this that's causing the damage. 
2319,"(Cheerfully, Steven smashes the automatic control unit.) "
2320,"STEVEN: Ah, that settles that. "
2321,SARA: Isn't that a rather a drastic way of dealing with things? 
2322,"STEVEN: Sara, the technology of my age may be hundreds of years behind"
2323,"yours and the Doctor's, but there are still some things I can handle. "
2324,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course there is, my dear boy. Of course there is. Come"
2325,"along, young lady, let's get on with our mineral while we still have"
2326,the time. 
2327,[Dalek Control centre]
2328,
2329, DALEK: Pursuit ship has broken free of our
2330,control. 
2331,BLACK: Activate magnetised beam. 
2332,DALEK: Magnetised beam activated. 
2333,CHEN: I sincerely hope there's not been any further bungling? 
2334,"BLACK: We have temporarily lost control, but once the magnetised beam"
2335,"reaches them it will pull them to Kembel, where they will be"
2336,exterminated! 
2337,"CHEN: After we have the core of the Time Destructor in our possession,"
2338,I trust. 
2339,BLACK: Of course! Of course!
2340,
2341,[Dalek Pursuit ship]
2342,
2343,"(Unaware of the new threat, The Doctor concentrates"
2344,"on replicating the taranium, and is pleased with his progress.) "
2345,"DOCTOR: Yes I think so, yes, yes, there. That's a good copy, although I"
2346,say it myself. 
2347,"SARA: Yes, but there's still the problem of charging it. The Daleks"
2348,will know immediately that it isn't the real taranium. 
2349,"DOCTOR: I appreciate that young lady, but this is the right balance and"
2350,the right weight. 
2351,STEVEN: We're still on our own course. The Daleks haven't attempted to
2352,divert us yet. 
2353,"DOCTOR: Oh good, good, good. Well you keep watching, there's a good"
2354,fellow. 
2355,STEVEN: Hey! 
2356,"DOCTOR: No, I should try that one. "
2357,(Steven examines the copy with admiration. The one thing that gives it
2358,away is that it's not glowing with energy like the real mineral.) 
2359,STEVEN: This is excellent. 
2360,DOCTOR: Isn't it. 
2361,STEVEN: How do you propose to activate it? 
2362,"DOCTOR: Oh, we're working on that. Yes, we're working on it. "
2363,STEVEN: We could use the gravity force from the ship's power centre. I
2364,"mean, there's an outlet here. "
2365,SARA: What? 
2366,STEVEN: What's wrong with that? 
2367,"DOCTOR: Too primitive, my boy. Too primitive and far too dangerous. "
2368,"SARA: Gravity force as a source of energy was abandoned, centuries ago."
2369,
2370,STEVEN: We were still using it. 
2371,"SARA: Oh yes, and the Romans used treadmills. "
2372,(Sara follows the Doctor to search for a suitable power source to
2373,safely activate the fake taranium. Steven continues to muse on his own
2374,theoretical solution.) 
2375,STEVEN: I still think G-force would do the trick. 
2376,SARA: We're changing course again. 
2377,"DOCTOR: Back to the planet Kembel but what? You know, it appears that"
2378,we're being affected by magnetization. We're been held in a very strong
2379,beam. 
2380,SARA: That will take us right back to the Daleks. 
2381,"DOCTOR: Let's try and break it, child. Come along. "
2382,"(While the Doctor and Sara do their best to escape from the beam,"
2383,Steven decides to take matters into his own hands and attempt to
2384,energise the fake taranium using G-force.) 
2385,STEVEN: Now we'll see about those treadmills. 
2386,"(Wiring the copy into the G-force outlet, Steven throws the switch."
2387,Argh! Steven collapses instantly.) 
2388,SARA: Steven! 
2389,DOCTOR: My dear boy! What happened? What's happened? He's still
2390,breathing. 
2391,SARA: The fool! He's tried his experiment with G-force and reliance
2392,power. 
2393,"DOCTOR: He's still alive, and lucky at that. "
2394,"SARA: But it worked! Look, Doctor. It's just like the real taranium. "
2395,"DOCTOR: Oh, isn't that wonderful. That's wonderful! Steven's theory has"
2396,proved successful. But what about the poor boy? 
2397,[Dalek Control centre]
2398,
2399, DALEK: Dalek pursuit ship has entered the
2400,atmosphere. 
2401,DALEK 2: Reducing speed. Ten degrees of light. Eight. Six. 
2402,CHEN: It appears that you have at last succeeded in getting the
2403,taranium back. 
2404,BLACK: Of course. And we shall deal with these fugitives as with all
2405,those who oppose us. 
2406,CHEN: No! 
2407,BLACK: Do you challenge us? 
2408,CHEN: Of course not. But might it not be advisable for me to return
2409,them to Earth for trial? 
2410,BLACK: Why? 
2411,CHEN: They will be tried and found guilty as traitors to the Solar
2412,"System. After all, the woman is from Earth. "
2413,"BLACK: The Daleks will deal with them, there is no need for the delay"
2414,in their extermination. 
2415,CHEN: Some people on Earth know that our traitors were transposed to
2416,"Mira. If they disappear for good, those people will be curious and ask"
2417,what happened to them. It's possible that they might find out that the
2418,Daleks executed them. Then your plans could be hindered. 
2419,BLACK: It is essential that you do not allow your Earth people to
2420,become curious. 
2421,CHEN: Human curiosity is something I can have no control over. 
2422,BLACK: You must forestall their questions until it is too late. 
2423,CHEN: Too late? 
2424,BLACK: Yes! We will have conquered the Solar System before our presence
2425,here is discovered. 
2426,CHEN: It is possible. 
2427,"BLACK: Once we have the taranium, there is nothing to stop us! "
2428,CHEN: Very well. I leave their fate to you. 
2429,BLACK: The Dalek reception force should now be in position at the
2430,specified landing point. 
2431,"CHEN: Yes, they should. And I think it's about time we left to join"
2432,"them, don't you?"
2433,
2434,[Dalek Pursuit ship]
2435,
2436,(The Dalek ship nears Kembel. The Doctor and Sara
2437,are powerless to intervene.) 
2438,SARA: Height and speed reducing. 
2439,"DOCTOR: Yes, we should be landing in about five minutes. "
2440,SARA: I'll see how Steven is. 
2441,"(Propped in a corner, Steven seems unable to move but his eyes are"
2442,open.) 
2443,SARA: I think the effect's wearing off. 
2444,"DOCTOR: No, my dear. He's adapting to it. Can you talk, my boy? No."
2445,He's still under the influence of that force field. Nothing further
2446,will happen to you. Now don't worry. 
2447,(The Doctor moves to touch Steven but draws his hand back as if
2448,shocked.) 
2449,"DOCTOR: Yes, nothing further going to happen to him but I must confess"
2450,I I have no cure for that condition. 
2451,SARA: He's enclosed in a forcefield. 
2452,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I'm afraid so. Sara, bring me that fake taranium."
2453,"Yes, yes, yes. Now, listen to me, Steven. Try and understand. This is"
2454,very important so you must trust me. You do understand? Just try and
2455,indicate. 
2456,"(With a struggle, Steven manages to blink his eyes.)"
2457,

2459,
2460, BLACK: Pursuit ship is landing at precise point
2461,calculated. 
2462,CHEN: Well it appears that everything's going according to plan. 
2463,BLACK: The taranium will be recovered. 
2464,CHEN: I hope you are right. 
2465,"BLACK: This time, there will no error. "
2466,(The pursuit ship lands.)

2471,"Daleks. Open the doors, please. Steven will lead the way. This way,"
2472,Steven. 
2473,"(Blank-faced, Steven walks ahead carrying the box containing the fake"
2474,taranium core.) 
2475,"SARA: But it won't, it can't work! "
2476,"DOCTOR: It's our only chance, my dear. And remember, I will do all the"
2477,talking. 
2478,(They follow Steven out of the ship.)
2479,
2480,[Kembel landing pad]
2481,
2482,(Chen watches as Steven comes down the ramp and
2483,instantly recognises the box he is carrying.) 
2484,"CHEN: The taranium! I would suggest that you give that to me, young"
2485,man. 
2486,"DOCTOR: No. And remember, you cannot fire because of the taranium."
2487,You'd have another fifty years work. 
2488,"CHEN: Possibly, But you are still in no position to bargain. "
2489,"DOCTOR: I will hand over the taranium outside my ship, the Tardis. "
2490,CHEN: You heard the condition. 
2491,BLACK: It is not acceptable. 
2492,CHEN: You heard what the Dalek Supreme said. 
2493,"DOCTOR: Outside my ship, the Tardis, or nowhere! "
2494,CHEN: He seems determined. Does it really matter? 
2495,BLACK: Very well. In front of his ship. 
2496,DOCTOR: Thank you. Steven? 
2497,(Steven sets off into the jungle and the Doctor follows with Sara. Chen
2498,catches sight of his former agent.) 
2499,CHEN: Kingdom. 
2500,SARA: Traitor. 
2501,(The Guardian is taken aback by Sara's venom and follows behind with
2502,the Daleks.)
2503,
2504,[Outside the Tardis] 
2505,(After a tense trek through the jungle they reach
2506,the Tardis. The Doctor gives Sara the key.) 
2507,"DOCTOR: Sara, open the door please. The young man will give you the"
2508,"taranium when the girl and I are safely inside my ship, the Tardis. "
2509,BLACK: Very well. 
2510,"CHEN: Making sure of your escape, eh, Doctor? "
2511,"DOCTOR: Remember to do exactly as I say, Steven. I will give you"
2512,further instructions from inside my Tardis. 
2513,(Steven nods. The Doctor and Sara go inside.) 
2514,"DOCTOR : Steven, hand the box over to Chen. Then come inside the"
2515,Tardis. 
2516,(Steven offers the box to Chen who snatches it from him. Chen is
2517,delighted when he opens the box and has to shield his eyes against the
2518,fierce glow.) 
2519,CHEN: This is it! The core of the Time Destructor! 
2520,(The Daleks turn on Steven.) 
2521,BLACK: Exterminate him! 
2522,(As the Daleks open fire Steven dives with inside the Tardis with the
2523,"rays bouncing off his forcefield, and the door slams shut. The Tardis"
2524,dematerialises.) 
2525,BLACK: The ray guns did not take effect! 
2526,DALEK: All were operated at full power. 
2527,BLACK: No human being can withstand their fire. 
2528,CHEN: What happened is unimportant! We have the taranium! The invasion
2529,can go ahead. The Universe will be ours!
2530,
2531,[Tardis]
2532,
2533,(Steven is recovering quickly.) 
2534,SARA: Are you sure you're all right? 
2535,"STEVEN: Yes, more or less. "
2536,DOCTOR: The Dalek guns must have destroyed that forcefield completely.
2537,It's a good thing they didn't fire a second time. 
2538,STEVEN: I don't really know what happened. 
2539,SARA: You were enclosed in a field of Gravity force and reliance power.
2540,
2541,"DOCTOR: You had a shield round you. You know, similar to that one that"
2542,"protects the Tardis. Oh, that's remind me. Where is that genuine"
2543,Taranium? 
2544,SARA: Over here. 
2545,"STEVEN: It's a pity I blacked out. I mean, if I knew the ratio"
2546,"readings, we could use the same force again to protect us from the"
2547,Daleks. 
2548,DOCTOR: Certainly not! What you did was very dangerous and extremely
2549,stupid. 
2550,"STEVEN: Oh, come off it. It worked. "
2551,DOCTOR: One more experiment like that and you really will be dead. 
2552,"STEVEN: Oh, nonsense. "
2553,"DOCTOR: Now, now, now, you listen to me, young man. I warned you it was"
2554,dangerous before you tried it. You might have killed yourself and blown
2555,"up the space-ship. Then, where would we all be? "
2556,STEVEN: I know where I'll be. I don't know about you lot. 
2557,"DOCTOR: Now, now, now, now don't be cheeky. "
2558,"STEVEN: Look, if it haven't been for me, how would you have charged the"
2559,taranium and carried out the hand-over? I think we should experiment
2560,further. 
2561,DOCTOR: I don't care what you think. We're not going to repeat it. Why
2562,do you think science turned down your discovery? Because it isn't safe.
2563,So perhaps in future you'll pay attention to what I say and remember
2564,that I happen to be the leader of this expedition and I don't want to
2565,keep on repeating myself. 
2566,STEVEN: But Doctor 
2567,"DOCTOR: Never mind the buts! If you don't like it, you can get off! "
2568,"STEVEN: All right Doctor, I promise that I won't experiment with it any"
2569,further. 
2570,DOCTOR: I hope not. 
2571,SARA: Something's gone wrong. 
2572,DOCTOR: What's the matter? 
2573,SARA: It's stopped going up and down. 
2574,STEVEN: That's means that we've landed. 
2575,"DOCTOR: Oh, tut, tut, tut. That scanner's not working. "
2576,SARA: Can you mend it? 
2577,"DOCTOR: Yes I shall have to repair it, of course, yes, yes, but that"
2578,means checking up on the whole circuit. 
2579,"STEVEN: Well, let's get on with it. "
2580,"DOCTOR: Ah, ah, ah. Don't you dare touch that. "
2581,STEVEN: Why not? 
2582,"DOCTOR: Well, just look at those dials. Look! Look here, Sara. You see"
2583,"those dials, now you know what that means? If either of you went"
2584,"outside, it would be extremely dangerous. The whole atmosphere is"
2585,entirely poisonous.

2594,"(In fact, the poisonous atmosphere is no more than"
2595,1960's urban pollution.) 
2596,SERGEANT: What in the name of? 
2597,(The Tardis looks quite at home outside a Police Station somewhere in
2598,the North of England.) 
2599,SERGEANT: Who put that there?

2601,"seasonal cheer, and singing carols.) "
2602,CONSTABLE 1 (the driver) + CONSTABLE 2 (the passenger): When a poor man
2603,"came inside, gathering winter fuel. "
2604,"CONSTABLE 1: Here, I reckon we could charm the birds of the trees. "
2605,CONSTABLE 2: I'd settle for some from the coffee bars. 
2606,"CONSTABLE 1: Here, what about 'While Shepherds Watch'? do you think"
2607,they'd appreciate that? 
2608,"CONSTABLE 2: Hey, now here's the Sergeant. Come on. "
2609,CONSTABLE 1: Oh. 
2610,"CONSTABLE 2: Hello Sergeant, what you doing out here? "
2611,"SERGEANT: Hey, come and have a look at this. "
2612,(They gather around the Tardis.) 
2613,"CONSTABLE 2: Well, where did that come from? "
2614,SERGEANT: You tell me. 
2615,"CONSTABLE 1: Oh, perhaps someone sent it to the Inspector as a"
2616,Christmas box. 
2617,SERGEANT: And perhaps you'll both just stay out here and watch it. 
2618,CONSTABLE 1: Why? Do you think it's going to fly away? 
2619,"SERGEANT: Just you stay there and keep an eye on it, right?"
2620,
2621,[Tardis]
2622,
2623," STEVEN: And just why, if it isn't safe for us, is"
2624,it safe for you? 
2625,DOCTOR: Will neither of you understand? 
2626,"SARA: For heaven's sake, let's go and fix the scanner! "
2627,"DOCTOR: No! Where you come from, in both places, the air is pure."
2628,Outside there is the worst kind of pollution I've met in years. 
2629,"STEVEN: Right, then you shouldn't go out there, either. "
2630,"DOCTOR: Ah, my dear boy, I'm used to all sorts of atmospheres. It won't"
2631,affect me. I shall have to go out and do the repairing myself. 
2632,SARA: But suppose something happens to you? 
2633,"DOCTOR: Then, and only then, can you come out. But you must be very,"
2634,very careful. 
2635,STEVEN: And how are we supposed to know that something has happened to
2636,you? 
2637,"DOCTOR: My dear young man, just give me a few minutes and if all is"
2638,"well, I shall be back inside again to tell you. "
2639,"STEVEN: And if not, we come out and find you? I seem to have been"
2640,through all this before. 
2641,"DOCTOR: Now, look here, my boy. You will do as you're told! Now you"
2642,just open the doors and remember to close them after I've gone.

2652,(The Doctor ducks back inside the Tardis.) 
2653,CONSTABLE 2: What's up? 
2654,CONSTABLE 1: See that? 
2655,CONSTABLE 2: See what? 
2656,CONSTABLE 1: That then. 
2657,CONSTABLE 2: What when? 
2658,"CONSTABLE 1: That door, "
2659,CONSTABLE 2: That door? 
2660,"CONSTABLE 1: It opened, "
2661,CONSTABLE 2: Did it? 
2662,CONSTABLE 1: There's a bloke in there. 
2663,"CONSTABLE 2: Oh, aye? "
2664,CONSTABLE 1: A bloke with long white hair. I just saw him. 
2665,CONSTABLE 2: Did you? 
2666,CONSTABLE 1: Aye. 
2667,CONSTABLE 2: It's locked. 
2668,CONSTABLE 1: But I just saw him.

2672,
2673," DOCTOR: No, police. P-O-L-I-C-E. "
2674,"SARA: Oh, I see. We've landed on your own planet. "
2675,"DOCTOR: Oh, nonsense, child. We're back on Earth. "
2676,SARA: But that's what's written outside the Tardis. 
2677,"DOCTOR: Oh, never mind. Never mind. I shall have to go outside and try"
2678,"and distract them. Meanwhile, you can stay here for a while then come"
2679,out and do the scanner. 
2680,"STEVEN: Yes. But, you said the air out there was so bad, that if we"
2681,went out 
2682,"DOCTOR: Never mind what I said, my dear boy. Do as you're told. Now"
2683,open the doors and remember to shut them after I've gone.

2691,"CONSTABLE 2: It wouldn't be Father Christmas, would it? "
2692,CONSTABLE 1: All right lad. It's a fair cop. 
2693,(The Doctor is escorted into the police station.)

2695,[Police station]

2697,(The desk sergeant is dealing with another
2698,visitor.) 
2699,SERGEANT: All right. What can I do for you? 
2700,MAN: I've got a complaint. 
2701,"SERGEANT: Well, the doctor's just around the corner. "
2702,"MAN: No, no, no, no. I, I mean, I want to make a complaint. "
2703,"SERGEANT: Oh, I see. Well, let's have your name then. "
2704,MAN: They keep moving me house. 
2705,SERGEANT: Moving your what? 
2706,MAN: House! 
2707,SERGEANT: They keep moving your house? 
2708,MAN: Yes. Me greenhouse. It's the rebels. 
2709,SERGEANT: The rebels? 
2710,CONSTABLE 1: Anyone in CID.? 
2711,"SERGEANT: Oh, straight through. "
2712,CONSTABLE 1: Good. Come on. 
2713,DOCTOR: (to the man) Haven't I seen your face before somewhere? 
2714,MAN: Where? 
2715,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course, I remember now, yes. The marketplace at Jaffa. "
2716,MAN: Jaffa? The young chap said I should come to see you about. 
2717,SERGEANT: Do what? 
2718,MAN: About me greenhouse. It's the rebels. 
2719,"(Having seen the Doctor taken away, Steven emerges from the Tardis"
2720,"intent on trying to rescue him, but he's forced to hide behind the"
2721,nearby police car when one of the officers reappears.)

2723,[Inspector's office]
2724,
2725,(The Doctor is being questioned by CID.) 
2726,"INSPECTOR: I've heard of a housing shortage, but I never knew it was so"
2727,bad you'd have to spend Christmas in a Police Box. 
2728,"DOCTOR: Oh, Christmas. Oh, is it? Of course. Yes, yes, yes, yes. That"
2729,accounts for the holly in the hall. 
2730,INSPECTOR: You mean you didn't know? 
2731,"DOCTOR: Well, of course I didn't know. I travel about too much. "
2732,INSPECTOR: And why is that? 
2733,"DOCTOR: Well, a quest of knowledge, dear boy. I mean, you have a saying"
2734,"in this country, have you not? Travel broadens the mind? "
2735,INSPECTOR: You mean you're not English? 
2736,"DOCTOR: No. Gracious, no. "
2737,INSPECTOR: Scottish? 
2738,DOCTOR: No. 
2739,"INSPECTOR: Are you Welsh, then? "
2740,"DOCTOR: Oh, you'll have to think in a far bigger way than that. Your"
2741,"ideas are too narrow, too small, too crippled. "
2742,"INSPECTOR: All right, all right. What are you then? "
2743,"DOCTOR: Well, I suppose you might say that I am a citizen of the"
2744,"universe, and a gentleman to boot. "
2745,"CONSTABLE 2: He's having us on a bit, isn't he sir? "
2746,"INSPECTOR: Now, look lad. "
2747,"(Outside, the police officer moves and Steven comes out of hiding. He"
2748,"seems unsure how best to proceed, but then spots the tunic of a police"
2749,"uniform on the back seat of the car. Making sure no one is about,"
2750,Steven opens the car door.)
2751,
2752,[Police station] 
2753, MAN: And now they've been and gone and moved it
2754,again. 
2755,"SERGEANT: Oh, where to this time? "
2756,MAN: I don't know. That's why I came to see you. The young fellow. 
2757,"SERGEANT: You sure it's not out there along beside the, oh, here, just"
2758,a minute. 
2759,"(Steven comes in, now dressed in police uniform.) "
2760,"STEVEN: Er, excuse me. "
2761,"SERGEANT: Ah. You must be the new bloke from G Division, come to help"
2762,us out. 
2763,"STEVEN: I, I beg your pardon? "
2764,SERGEANT: I said you must be the new bloke from G Division. 
2765,"STEVEN: Must I? Oh! Oh, yes. Yes, that's right. Yes, I've called about"
2766,the old man. 
2767,SERGEANT: Old man? What old man? 
2768,"STEVEN: Well, he was brought in here a minute ago. "
2769,"SERGEANT: Oh, he's with the CID. You'd better wait until they've"
2770,finished with him. 
2771,"STEVEN: Fine, yeah. Well, I've got to get to him. "
2772,"SERGEANT: Well, you'll have to wait, lad. He'll be out here again soon."
2773,Now wait over there. 
2774,MAN: Now what about my greenhouse? 
2775,"SERGEANT: Oh, yes. Now where was it you said? "
2776,"MAN: Well, for a start, it's not in me garden."
2777,
2778, [Inspector's office]
2779,
2780, DOCTOR: I don't think you really understand. That
2781,object in the yard out there isn't really a police box. 
2782,"INSPECTOR: No, no, of course it's not. It's the new Brighton ferry. "
2783,DOCTOR: It is a machine for investigating Time and Relative Dimensions
2784,in Space. 
2785,(The officers draw discreetly to one side.) 
2786,CONSTABLE 2: He's a nutter. 
2787,"INSPECTOR: He's straight from a funny-farm, if you ask me. "
2788,DOCTOR: Do I take it that you gentlemen are imputing that I am mentally
2789,deranged? 
2790,CONSTABLE 2: I told you. He's a nutter. 
2791,INSPECTOR: Was he the only bloke in the box? 
2792,CONSTABLE 1: Well how should I know? 
2793,INSPECTOR: Well didn't you check? There might be a whole army of them
2794,"in there, living like gypsies in one of Her Majesty's police telephone"
2795,boxes. 
2796,CONSTABLE 2: And just how many people do you expect to come out of one
2797,box?

2801,"(Sara comes out of the Tardis, considering how she"
2802,"might climb up to fix the scanner eye, and rather concerned that the"
2803,Doctor and Steven have not yet returned. SARA: Where have they got to? 
2804,"CONSTABLE 1: Hello, Hello. What are you doing hanging around here on"
2805,Christmas Day? 
2806,SARA: Nothing. 
2807,"CONSTABLE 1: Surprised to see a police box here, I suppose? "
2808,SARA: Oh! You think it's yours? 
2809,"CONSTABLE 1: Well, not mine exactly. Well, let's say it belongs to us,"
2810,"eh? So why don't you leave it where it is and just move along, eh? "
2811,SARA: I've got to fix it. 
2812,CONSTABLE 1: Fix what? 
2813,SARA: The scanner eye. 
2814,CONSTABLE 1: The scanner eye? 
2815,SARA: Yes. 
2816,"CONSTABLE 1: Oh, you do? "
2817,SARA: Yes. 
2818,"CONSTABLE 1: Oh. Well, we usually get the jokers around here at"
2819,"Christmas time, but we have to be lenient. So, just move along, eh? "
2820,SARA: I can't. 
2821,"CONSTABLE 1: Oh, yes you can, young lady. That's enough of joking. I'm"
2822,"sure you're going to enjoy yourself at that party you're going to, so"
2823,why not go down there now. 
2824,SARA: I'm not going to a party. 
2825,"CONSTABLE 1: Well, wherever you are going dressed up in them fancy"
2826,"clothes, you leave now and there won't be no trouble. "
2827,SARA: I've got to stay here. 
2828,"CONSTABLE 1: Now you take my advice, young lady, and leave now."
2829,"Otherwise, I might have to run you in for loitering or something like"
2830,that. I wouldn't like to have to do that. We've had a bit of trouble
2831,"like that already tonight. You see, we don't like people hanging"
2832,"around. But at Christmas time we have to be lenient, and we don't want"
2833,to be too difficult for you. 
2834,"SARA: But. Oh, very well. "
2835,"CONSTABLE 1: Have a, have a, have a swinging time. Funny girl. "
2836,SARA: The idiots. They've obviously got themselves into some kind of
2837,trouble.
2838,
2839,[Police station]
2840,
2841," SERGEANT: Why don't you sit down, lad. You're"
2842,making the place look untidy. 
2843,"(At that moment, the Doctor is brought out of the interrogation room.) "
2844,STEVEN: It's all right? 
2845,"DOCTOR: Of course, of course. And what are you doing here? "
2846,INSPECTOR: Who are you? Do you know this man? 
2847,"STEVEN: Yes. I, I mean, aye. "
2848,"SERGEANT: He's the extra bloke from G Division, sir. "
2849,"STEVEN: Oh, yeah. It's all right. I'll look after him. "
2850,"INSPECTOR: Well, if you know him, perhaps you can tell us what he's"
2851,doing in a police box. 
2852,STEVEN: A what? 
2853,INSPECTOR: That police box across the yard. He claims to live in it. 
2854,"STEVEN: Hold on, just a minute. It'll be all right. Just a minute. Oh,"
2855,"er, it's all right, er, you see, he's a funny fellow but I know how to"
2856,handle him. We're used to him down in G Division. 
2857,"INSPECTOR: Very well. Well, get him out of here, and see that he steers"
2858,clear of that police box. 
2859,"STEVEN: Right. I'll do that, sir. Right. Er, come on then, old man. "
2860,DOCTOR: Enough of the old man either. What's all this funny accent? 
2861,STEVEN: Everybody else is doing it. 
2862,"SERGEANT: I'll come with you, make sure you can manage. "

2870,(Now Sara has been apprehended. 
2871,"CONSTABLE 2: I don't know what it is about that police box, but first"
2872,"of all, the old bloke comes out of it. Now I catch this lass climbing"

2874,SARA: Please let me go! 
2875,STEVEN: It's all right. I know her too. 
2876,"SERGEANT: Aye. You seem to know all the queer people. Well, who is she?"
2877,
2878,"STEVEN: Well, she's a, she's a friend of the old man's. "
2879,"SARA: Let me go! Come on, Steven. "
2880,"(With a well-aimed elbow, Sara struggles free, and she and Steven slip"
2881,into the Tardis after the Doctor. It dematerialises.) 
2882,"CONSTABLE 1: Hello. hello. What's up with you? 'ere, 'ere, it's gone. "
2883,CONSTABLE 2: What? 
2884,"CONSTABLE 1: That telephone box, it's gone. Weren't it meant for us? "
2885,
2886,[Tardis]
2887,
2888," STEVEN: I found this jacket, so they thought I was"
2889,one of their group. And when you appeared on the scene they were
2890,completely mystified. 
2891,"DOCTOR: Well, even I, dear boy, must admit that I enjoyed myself. Did"
2892,you fix the scanner? 
2893,SARA: I did. And no help from either of you. 
2894,DOCTOR: Oh. 
2895,STEVEN: At least it's working. 
2896,DOCTOR: Have you checked it? 
2897,SARA: Of course not. After that man grabbed me I didn't have a chance. 
2898,"DOCTOR: Never mind, never mind. Is the taranium safe? "
2899,STEVEN: Yes. Over there. 
2900,"SARA: Oh, I'd forgotten about the Daleks. "
2901,"DOCTOR: Now, that's one thing you mustn't do, my dear. Remember, they"
2902,have the same type of machines and they can follow us. 
2903,"STEVEN: Yes. But, they won't have found out about the switch yet. "
2904,"DOCTOR: No, I sincerely hope not. "
2905,SARA: While we have the taranium their plan cannot work. 
2906,DOCTOR: I don't think the Daleks will attack the Solar System until
2907,they've checked their Time Destructor. 
2908,STEVEN: Then what can we do? 
2909,"DOCTOR: Well, I think we might, perhaps, be able to destroy the"
2910,taranium before they catch us up. 
2911,SARA: I think we've stopped again. 
2912,"DOCTOR: Yes, we might, we might still be on Earth. Wait a minute. "
2913,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. The atmosphere has improved considerably. Yes, let's"
2914,have a look at the scanner. It might tell us something. 
2915,(The Tardis appears to have materialised inside a wood mill. A woman
2916,screams.)

2927,"anywhere. Ha, ha. "
2928,"(Steven, still dressed as a policeman, dashes from the Tardis and"
2929,"attacks the man, knocking him over. Sara rushes forward and unties the"
2930,girl. But all is not as it seems. The Tardis has landed on a Hollywood
2931,movie set in the early days of film.)

2942,"BLOSSOM: Oh, Steinberger, what are you going to do about it? "
2943,"(Steinberger P Green is delighted with their performance, Blossom"
2944,LeFevre and the leading man less so.) 
2945,GREEN: Pipe down now. There's no camera running now. Save it for later.
2946,
2947,"TRANTON: Steinberger, look at my eye. "
2948,GREEN: (to a crewman) Hey you!

2952,"GREEN: bigger than Fairbanks! Well, don't just stand there, "
2953,TRANTON: Look what they've done to my eye. Look at my eye! Look at my
2954,eye! 
2955,GREEN: Go get them!

3399,"SARA: Where are we, Doctor? Do you know? "
3400,"STEVEN: It doesn't look very pleasant, does it? "
3401,"DOCTOR: No, we must take off quite soon. "
3402,SARA: It's stopped. 
3403,"STEVEN: What does that mean, Doctor? Have we shaken it off? "
3404,"DOCTOR: No, my boy, we haven't shaken them off. Whoever it was"
3405,following us has landed. They've landed out there. 
3406,"(Not far away, a large boulder stands alone on the uneven volcanic"
3407,ground. It appears even more odd when a door opens in the side of the
3408,boulder and the figure of a man in monk's robes appears. The Monk scans
3409,the horizon using a pair of binoculars and is delighted when he spots
3410,the Doctor's Tardis a short distance away.) 
3411,[Planet surface]
3412,
3413," STEVEN: You know, Doctor, it would help if we knew"
3414,what we were looking for. 
3415,SARA: I still say it was madness to come out here. We should have taken
3416,off again or tried to get back to Kembel. 
3417,"DOCTOR: My dear young girl, what good would it be to run away? The"
3418,sooner we find who's pursuing us the better. 
3419,(Steven sits down on some rocks then stands up again hurriedly.) 
3420,"STEVEN: Hey! Hey, this is hot. "
3421,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I can well imagine that. This is a new planet, my"
3422,"boy. It's cooling down, cooling down. Fascinating. Yes, extremely"
3423,fascinating. I wonder? I wonder who'd take the time and trouble to
3424,"follow us? Yes, I think there is an explanation, but unlikely."
3425,"Possible, very possible. "
3426,"(As the Doctor and his companions widen their search, The Monk circles"
3427,round behind them. He manages to avoid being spotted and at last
3428,reaches the Doctor's Tardis. Petulantly he kicks at the ship but only
3429,succeeds in hurting his foot. It's time for a more scientific approach.
3430,The Monk takes a small pencil laser from his tool bag and puts on a
3431,pair of dark goggles to protect his eyes. He applies the laser to the
3432,"Tardis lock. There is no apparent damage to the Tardis, but the Monk"
3433,"seems delighted with his handiwork. Putting his tools away, he sets off"
3434,back to his own ship.) 
3435,DOCTOR: Hello there! Hello! Don't you think we should meet and talk it
3436,over? 
3437,"STEVEN: Doctor, who are we waiting for? "
3438,"DOCTOR: Oh, you'll see, my boy, you'll see. "
3439,"STEVEN: Oh, come on, tell us, otherwise you'll say you're right whoever"
3440,we meet. 
3441,"DOCTOR: You lack one quality of all the others, my boy, and that is"
3442,patience. 
3443,"(On a ridge above them, the Monk comes into view, a large rock raised"
3444,defensively over his head.) 
3445,"SARA: Doctor, look! "
3446,"DOCTOR: Ah, tut, tut, tut, my dear Monk. Now don't be so ridiculous."
3447,Put that down at once. 
3448,"MONK: Well, hello, Doctor. Keeping well? "
3449,"DOCTOR: Oh, no complaints, no. And you? "
3450,"MONK: Oh, so so, you know, just so so. "
3451,SARA: Who is it? 
3452,"MONK: Delighted to see you again, young man. "
3453,STEVEN: Thanks. I wish I could say the same for you. 
3454,DOCTOR: I suppose congratulations for your escape are quite in order. 
3455,"MONK: Oh, thank you. Most kind of you, Doctor. Yes, it took a bit of"
3456,"time, but I finally managed to bypass the dimensional controller. "
3457,"DOCTOR: Yes, a very interesting solution, yes, I'm sure, though I think"
3458,"it would make for rather an uncomfortable ride. However, I don't"
3459,"suppose it affected you very much, being an amateur. "
3460,"MONK: Yes, it was rather uncomfortable, but then, we can't have"
3461,"everything, can we? As for being an amateur, we shall see. Anyway, it"
3462,was better than 1066. 
3463,"DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose so. "
3464,"SARA: What's he talking about, 1066? "
3465,STEVEN: It's all right. We've met the Monk once before. I'll explain
3466,later. 
3467,"DOCTOR: And you returned here for one obvious reason, did you not? "
3468,"MONK: I'm afraid so, Doctor. Revenge is a strange thing, isn't it? "
3469,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, quite, quite. Tell me, any plans? "
3470,"MONK: And all carried out as well. Oh, ho. Doctor, you remember you"
3471,"left me in 1066? Now I've marooned you on the planet Tigus. Look! Oh,"
3472,"it's funny this. Forgive me laughing, Doctor, but I don't seem to be"
3473,"able to control it. Well, goodbye, Doctor. Perhaps I'll come back one"
3474,day and rescue you. 
3475,"STEVEN: Hey, wait a minute. "
3476,"DOCTOR: Don't waste your breath, young man. The most important thing"
3477,"is, is to find out what he's done to the Tardis. Come on."

3481,(The Doctor tries to unlock the door but his key
3482,will not work.) 
3483,DOCTOR: Reset the lock mechanism. He probably used some kind of ray. 
3484,SARA: What does that mean? 
3485,"DOCTOR: That means we cannot get back into the Tardis, child! "
3486,"(From a safe distance, the Monk watches gleefully as Steven tries"
3487,picking the lock without success.) 
3488,"DOCTOR: Oh, you will achieve nothing, dear boy, nothing. "
3489,"SARA: Yes, perhaps, but it's better than just accepting everything. "
3490,"DOCTOR: Yes, like I am, I suppose? "
3491,"STEVEN: Well, you haven't been taking much interest have you, Doctor? "
3492,"DOCTOR: Oh, and why not, dear boy, why not? Because I am using my"
3493,brain. I'm trying to solve this problem. 
3494,(The Doctor takes off his ring and looks at it thoughtfully.) 
3495,"DOCTOR: Now just stand back and cover your eyes, please. "
3496,(He angles the ring so as to reflect the glare of Tigus' sun onto the
3497,lock.) 
3498,STEVEN: What does that do? 
3499,"DOCTOR: Perhaps nothing, perhaps everything. Will you do as you're told"
3500,"at once. Cover your eyes, please. "
3501,(Sara tries the door.) 
3502,SARA: It hasn't worked. 
3503,"DOCTOR: Wait a moment, child. "
3504,(The Doctor uses his key to unlock the door then stands aside.) 
3505,DOCTOR: Now try. 
3506,"STEVEN: You're a genius, Doctor. "
3507,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know, my boy. I know. "
3508,(The Tardis dematerialises. The Monk can barely believe his eyes.) 
3509,"MONK: Oh, no, no. Don't think I'm going to leave it at this. You"

3514," STEVEN: If you ask me, we haven't heard the last"
3515,of that monk. 
3516,"DOCTOR: Quite so, dear boy. He'll be on our trail again as fast as he"
3517,can get going. 
3518,"SARA: Yes, but next time we'll be expecting him. "
3519,"DOCTOR: Exactly, my dear, exactly. Now, Steven, there's something I"
3520,want you to do. Go to that indicator and let me know the instant the
3521,Monk's Tardis registers. 
3522,"STEVEN: Yes, all right, but first you tell us something. How did you"
3523,break that lock? 
3524,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's all very simple, dear boy. You see the sun in that"
3525,particular galaxy has very unusual powers. I merely reflected its
3526,powers through that ring. 
3527,SARA: Is there something special about it? 
3528,"DOCTOR: Yes, it has certain properties. The combined forces of that sun"
3529,together with the stone in that ring was sufficient enough to correct
3530,the Monk's interference. 
3531,"STEVEN: Yes, but what properties has it? "
3532,"DOCTOR: Now, I don't want to discuss this anymore. Please, about turn,"
3533,and do as you're told. Go along.

3813,agree? 
3814,"MONK: Oh, yes, I would agree. "
3815,CHEN: Then why have you arrived here? 
3816,"MONK: Three, three time-machines? Yes, well, the odd one out belongs to"
3817,a certain Doctor. 
3818,DALEK: The enemy ship! 
3819,"MONK: Yes, that's right. The enemy. I have an old score to settle with"
3820,"him, but I'm sure yours is the prior claim. "
3821,CHEN: He is a friend of yours? 
3822,"MONK: Friend? No, no, an enemy. An enemy to end all enemies! I came"
3823,"here to inflict a terrible vengeance on him. I mean, we're all on the"
3824,"same side here, aren't we. "
3825,CHEN: But he knows you. 
3826,"MONK: Well, er, in a manner of speaking, yes, and again in another"
3827,"manner of speaking, no. "
3828,CHEN: Could you gain his confidence? 
3829,"MONK: Certainly, certainly. If you wanted me to. Oh, there's no"

3831,CHEN: Then you may have a slight chance of saving your life. The Doctor
3832,and his friends have in their possession a full emm of taranium. 
3833,MONK: A full emm of taranium. 
3834,CHEN: It belongs to the Daleks. You will recover this and return it to
3835,us within one Earth hour. 
3836,"MONK: Oh, I will. I promise. "
3837,CHEN: And I need hardly remind you that the Daleks will reward failure
3838,on your part with elimination. 
3839,"MONK: Elimination. Thank you. Elimination! Oh, you'll get it back, have"
3840,no fear.

3842,valuable time.

4238,"DOCTOR: Away, all of you. Mavic Chen, join me at the back here. I am"
4239,now about to hand over the taranium core to Mavic Chen. Follow me. 
4240,(The Doctor give Chen the core and runs) 
4241,HYKSOS: Smash the war machines! Smash them to bits! 
4242,DALEK: Attack formation.

4250," STEVEN: You did it, Doctor. We got away again. "
4251,"DOCTOR: I'm afraid not, young man. "
4252,"SARA: Why not, Doctor? What went wrong? "
4253,DOCTOR: I had to hand the real taranium core over to Mavic Chen. I know
4254,I should have tried to get him but it was hopeless. There was so much
4255,"chaos going on, and now it's too late. "
4256,SARA: That means that the Daleks have won. There's nothing to stop them
4257,now. 
4258,DOCTOR: Except this. 
4259,SARA: What's that? 
4260,DOCTOR: That is the directional unit from the Monk's Tardis. 
4261,STEVEN: Directional? But with this we can get back to Kembel. 
4262,"DOCTOR: Perhaps, perhaps. "
4263,"SARA: But that's marvellous, Doctor. "
4264,"DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose it is. But that isn't all, my dear. "
4265,"STEVEN: No, I'm sure it isn't Doctor, but this is hardly the time or"
4266,"the place to tell us about it. I mean, the Daleks will be here soon. "
4267,"DOCTOR: I think not, dear boy. I had to take precautionary measures in"
4268,"case my plans didn't work. Now whilst I was collecting that unit, I"
4269,changed the Monk's Tardis into a police telephone box. 
4270,SARA: Like yours. 
4271,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, exactly like mine. Well of course the Daleks will be"
4272,"on our track but I think, should my plan succeed, they will find the"
4273,Monk. 
4274,"STEVEN: By the way, what happened to him? He was with us. "
4275,DOCTOR: I don't care if he's in Timbuktu. 
4276,(And they go into the Tardis)
4277,
4278,[Outside the Monk's Tardis]
4279,
4280, MONK: I got away from that Steven and Sara. Oh.
4281,The Doctor. He transformed my Tardis. 
4282,DALEK : There is one of the time travellers. Stop his escape.
4283,Exterminate him! Exterminate him! 
4284,(The Monk scrambles inside his Tardis) 
4285,DALEK: Combined fire! 
4286,"(As they fire, the Monk's Tardis dematerialises.) "
4287,DALEK: They have escaped. We shall pursue them through eternity. The
4288,taranium core must be recovered! 
4289,CHEN: This patrol is obviously out of touch with events. 
4290,DALEK: What do you mean? 
4291,CHEN: All this hysteria is unnecessary. The operation was a complete
4292,success. I have the taranium here. 
4293,"DALEK: You have done well. Patrol, return to the time-machine. We must"
4294,leave for Kembel at once.
4295,

4297,
4298," STEVEN: Yes, well, I hope the Daleks don't catch"
4299,the Monk. 
4300,SARA: After all that he's done? 
4301,"STEVEN: Yes, even after all that. "
4302,"DOCTOR: Oh, I shouldn't worry any more, my dear boy. There's no doubt"
4303,"about it, he's right away by now. "
4304,STEVEN: Do you think he'll come looking for revenge again? 
4305,"DOCTOR: Perhaps, yes. Perhaps one day. At the moment, I should say that"
4306,he's had quite enough for us for a while. Having taken his directional
4307,"unit, it will take him quite a time to make the necessary repairs to"
4308,his ship. 
4309,SARA: What about our repairs? Will the unit work? 
4310,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm not certain. It's a Mark four, remember. There are"
4311,"two possibilities. One, it would work. "
4312,"STEVEN: Go on, Doctor. "
4313,"DOCTOR: Number two, the increased energy rate will certainly destroy"
4314,the centre column. 
4315,SARA: But we do have a chance? 
4316,"DOCTOR: Yes, my dear. A chance. A slim one."

4329,The Doctor. He's stolen my directional unit. Now I'll have to wander
4330,"through time and space as lost as he is. I'll get you for this, Doctor!"
4331,I'll get you one day!

4335, DOCTOR: There we are. That's finished. It's a pity
4336,we haven't got a more reliable way of testing it. 
4337,"SARA: Well, come on, I thought you said that it's was finished. "
4338,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, it is finished, my dear. But, er. "
4339,"STEVEN: Oh, come on, Doctor. We haven't got time for buts. This is our"
4340,only hope. 
4341,"DOCTOR: Yes. You realise, of course, we're taking a terrible chance. "
4342,STEVEN: You can save your breath. We've got to try it.

4350,
4351,(The Dalek time machine materialises) 
4352,CHEN: The mission has been completed successfully. With guile and
4353,"cunning, I have been able to repossess the taranium. "
4354,BLACK: Are you certain it is the real core? 
4355,CHEN: Of course. I had it examined before we arrived here. It is ready
4356,to be fitted to the Time Destructor. I hope that the Daleks will not
4357,suffer any more setbacks which could upset the plans for our conquest
4358,of the universe. 
4359,BLACK: The final conference of the remaining members of the Galactic
4360,Council awaits you. 
4361,"CHEN: I shall go and address them, presently. "
4362,(Chen leaves the control room.) 
4363,RED: The task force has disembarked. 
4364,BLACK: Excellent. Is the core fitted to the time destructor? 
4365,RED: That is being done. Do we now deal with Mavic Chen? 
4366,BLACK: No. His arrogance and greed have a further use for us. Alert the
4367,council to attend their final conference.
4368,
4369,[Tardis]
4370,
4371," DOCTOR: Well, fortunately there's no damage done"
4372,to the control panel itself. 
4373,STEVEN: But the directional unit? 
4374,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's useless, dear boy, useless. Take a look for"
4375,yourself. 
4376,SARA: What happened? 
4377,"DOCTOR: Well, the unit required a much higher energy rate then we"
4378,possess. 
4379,SARA: Then why did it burn out and not the Tardis controls? 
4380,"DOCTOR: A built-in safety measure, my dear. You see, the excess energy"
4381,must have forced itself back into the directional unit and that means
4382,that our plans to return to Kembel have failed. 
4383,STEVEN: That means that the Daleks can invade the universe and conquer
4384,it. 
4385,"DOCTOR: Yes, and there's nothing that we can do about it. "
4386,"SARA: There must be something we can do, Doctor. You must try to think"
4387,of some way. 
4388,"DOCTOR: Well, our only chance, my dear, is to try and capture the"
4389,Monk's time machine or that of the Daleks. 
4390,"STEVEN: Yes, well, let's get going. "
4391,"DOCTOR: Have patience, dear boy. It's highly probable they've all left"
4392,"by now, and I should think there's one or two of those Egyptians"
4393,around. Let's take a look on the scanner. 
4394,SARA: But that's not ancient Egypt. 
4395,"STEVEN: It's, it's more like Kembel! "
4396,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's vaguely familiar. It might be Kembel. Do you know"
4397,that means that that directional unit must have burned itself out after
4398,"we'd dematerialised. I wonder if you'd bring that er, that impulse"
4399,compass. 
4400,"STEVEN: Yeah, sure. "
4401,"DOCTOR: Well, now, young lady? Perhaps you'll have more faith in me in"
4402,the future. I thought something would work out. 
4403,SARA: But it was you who said we'd failed! 
4404,"DOCTOR: Oh, nonsense, nonsense. "
4405,"SARA: Well, it wasn't me! "
4406,DOCTOR: Of course it was. 
4407,"STEVEN: Oh, come on, Doctor, you'll have to forgive her. After all, she"
4408,hasn't known you very long. 
4409,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, perhaps, perhaps. Anyway, now we're here I think"
4410,we'd better make a plan. 
4411,STEVEN: How far do you think that we are from the Dalek city? 
4412,DOCTOR: I've no idea. Though I think we might be able to make it on
4413,"foot. Perhaps I'd better go out and take some bearings. Open the door,"
4414,dear boy. 
4415,STEVEN: Yes. 
4416,SARA: That man! He was as much in the dark as we were and now he has
4417,the gall to 
4418,STEVEN: Very good. You're getting to know him quite well.

4422,[Conference room]
4423,
4424, CELATION: There has been too much time wasted
4425,"through the folly of the representative from Earth. Surely, it is only"
4426,right that on his return he be removed from this council. 
4427,BEAUS: But without him there will be no taranium! 
4428,CELATION: The Daleks have assured us that they will recapture the core
4429,of the time destructor. 
4430,BEAUS: Then we do not need Mavic Chen? 
4431,CELATION: Exactly! He no longer merits a place on this Galactic
4432,Council. I call for a censure motion. 
4433,(The delegates thump the conference table in agreement. Chen and the
4434,Dalek Supreme enter to witness this treacherous display.) 
4435,"BLACK: Silence! The final conference is now in session. Mavic Chen,"
4436,"representative from the Solar System, will address the meeting. "
4437,(Chen bows to the Dalek then crosses to the table to address the other
4438,delegates.) 
4439,"CHEN: Fellow delegates. Even as you sit here, the great war force"
4440,"assembled under the Daleks, is awaiting the final order to set out and"
4441,conquer the universe! 
4442,BEAUS: Why is Mavic Chen speaking for the Dalek Supreme? 
4443,CHEN: The final checks are being made and in a very short time that
4444,final order will be given! 
4445,CELATION: Why is it that Mavic Chen is in possession of information
4446,denied to the rest of this Council? 
4447,CHEN: Though we are all equal partners with the Daleks on this great
4448,"conquest, some of us are more equal than others. "
4449,BEAUS: The Representative speaks out of turn! 
4450,"CHEN: No! My contribution of the emm of taranium, is greater than all"
4451,"of yours put together. You have been dwarfed, dwarfed! "
4452,CELATION: This violates the agreement by which this council was
4453,assembled. 
4454,BEAUS: Arrest him! Arrest him! Arrest him! 
4455,"CHEN: You have no power to arrest anybody. You are nothing, do you hear"
4456,me? Nothing! 
4457,(The council members are united in their condemnation of Chen's
4458,"ambition. The representatives are all on their feet, shouting. Giron"
4459,moves forward to attack Chen. There's the sound of a weapon and Giron
4460,"crumples to the floor. Smiling, Chen stands over Giron's fallen body, a"
4461,blaster in his hand. The other delegates are stunned into
4462,silence.) 
4463,"CHEN: Before this conference began, the Dalek Supreme and I spoke"
4464,together. This Council now is under my power. I will give the orders.
4465,You will obey them.

4470,"vegetation, using a compass-like device to try to find their way back"
4471,to the Dalek city. He reaches a clearing and stops to wait for the
4472,others to catch him up.) 
4473,STEVEN: You all right? 
4474,"SARA: Yes, though this jungle is hardly the place I choose for a gentle"
4475,stroll. 
4476,STEVEN: Just be careful of the Vargas. 
4477,SARA: Vargas? I haven't seen any Varga plants. 
4478,"STEVEN: They've all over the. Come to think of it, neither have I. I"
4479,thought the Daleks scattered them all over Kembel. 
4480,"SARA: Steven, you're sure we are on Kembel? "
4481,STEVEN: Of course I am. The Doctor was certain when he took these rea.
4482,Where is he?
4483,
4484,[Conference room]
4485,
4486, CELATION: We have all served the common cause! All
4487,of us! 
4488,"CHEN: Indeed we have. But I, Mavic Chen, was solely responsible for the"
4489,"recovery of the core of the time destructor. Because of this, I"
4490,"naturally precede anyone here. For without my power, the Daleks cannot"
4491,succeed. You do appreciate the point. 
4492,"CELATION: There remains one question. Where is our co-ruler, the Dalek"
4493,Supreme? 
4494,CHEN: He was 
4495,(Chen turns and realises with some surprise that the Dalek Supreme has
4496,left the conference chamber. He climbs to the top of the exit ramp and
4497,finds the doorway barred. But Chen's vanity cannot be so easily
4498,contained.) 
4499,CHEN: It is clear that he knows that I can run this council without his
4500,"aid. Now, gentlemen, we come to the main discussion before this"
4501,meeting. The apportioning of the government of the universe after the
4502,"conquest. All of you will be allowed to oversee your own galaxies, but"
4503,all of you will be responsible to the Dalek Supreme and me. 
4504,"(Unnoticed, a party of Daleks has re-entered the room.) "
4505,DALEK: This meeting is over. 
4506,CHEN: But it's isn't 
4507,DALEK: There will be no more discussion. All representatives will come
4508,with us.

4514,STEVEN: Where can he have got to? 
4515,"SARA: Anywhere you like, out there. "
4516,STEVEN: This is serious. Perhaps the Daleks have caught him? 
4517,"SARA: Then now they'll be looking for us. Look Steven, with or without"
4518,the Doctor we've got to get to the Dalek city and find a way of putting
4519,that place out of action. 
4520,"STEVEN: Yes, but, Sara, what about the Doctor? He can't just have"
4521,vanished into thin air. We've got to find him. 
4522,"SARA: No, not yet. Mavic Chen will have returned with the taranium."
4523,That means the Daleks plans will be ready to go ahead and we've got to
4524,stop them. 
4525,STEVEN: I understand that. We can't just leave the Doctor wandering
4526,around lost in this jungle. 
4527,SARA: If I know anything about him he's already reached the city. If we
4528,go there we can stop the Daleks and find the Doctor. 
4529,"STEVEN: Yes, all right. "
4530,"(They set off back through the jungle, making slow progress through the"
4531,thick undergrowth.) 
4532, [Kembel - jungle] 
4533, (Steven keeps one eye on the compass.) 
4534,STEVEN: The stronger signal's on bearing 242. According to the Doctor
4535,the Dalek city is over there. 
4536,SARA: Where to now? 
4537,STEVEN: I'll just take another reading. 
4538,SARA: What exactly is 
4539,"STEVEN: Shush. So far, so good. We're on the right track. The source of"
4540,power is still 242. 
4541,SARA: Would you mind telling me how that thing works? 
4542,STEVEN: What now? 
4543,"SARA: Yes, now. "
4544,"STEVEN: Look Sara, this is no time for a lesson on the power impulse"
4545,compass. 
4546,SARA: Supposing something happens to you? 
4547,STEVEN: What are you talking about? 
4548,SARA: I'd have to go ahead and reach the city alone. Don't you think
4549,you ought to show me how it works in case of accidents?

4565,SARA: Yes. Are those the Dalek ships? 
4566,STEVEN: No. Those belong to the other representatives. 
4567,SARA: Where's the Dalek landing area? 
4568,"STEVEN: There too, possibly. But those representative ships'll have to"
4569,take off first to collect their forces for the invasion. 
4570,"SARA: Right, let's get going. "
4571,STEVEN: Just a minute! 
4572,SARA: Why? We've got to defeat the Daleks. 
4573,STEVEN: We've got to try to defeat the Daleks. If you and I just charge
4574,in there what chance do you think we've got against the greatest war
4575,force ever assembled. 
4576,"SARA: Oh, for heaven's sake, we'll go carefully. Look, Steven, just"
4577,because the Doctor isn't here don't think that you're the only one who
4578,can outwit the Daleks. 
4579,"STEVEN: Look, I don't think that. But as you said, in any case, we'll"
4580,probably find he's here already. 
4581,SARA: Come on.

4588,"unguarded entrance and slip inside. Before long, however, they realise"
4589,something is not right.) 
4590,"STEVEN: I don't get it. It's uncanny. I mean, where have the Daleks got"
4591,to? 
4592,SARA: It's like a city of the dead. 
4593,STEVEN: Let's see if there's any sign of life down here. 
4594,"(They move off down another corridor, moving deeper into the city and"
4595,expecting at any moment to encounter a Dalek patrol.) 
4596,STEVEN: We should have been challenged by now. 
4597,SARA: We haven't come very far yet. 
4598,STEVEN: What's that got to do with it? 
4599,SARA: They're probably making final preparations for the invasion. 
4600,"STEVEN: Yes, well, they'd still need guards out here. "
4601,SARA: Maybe they're not frightened. 
4602,STEVEN: They always take some precautions. 
4603,"SARA: All right, you think of an explanation. "
4604,"STEVEN: Well, look, suppose. Suppose the Doctor did come here and they"
4605,have caught him. 
4606,SARA: Then now they'll be looking for us. 
4607,"STEVEN: No, possibly not. Not if he said he was alone. "
4608,SARA: Huh. They wouldn't believe him. 
4609,STEVEN: Why not? We weren't anywhere around. 
4610,"SARA: Steven, this could all be a trick. If they have caught the Doctor"
4611,then they could be waiting for us. 
4612,"STEVEN: No. No, if they've caught the Doctor they won't worry about us."
4613,We've got to find him.

4618,SARA: Then this must be a trap. 
4619,STEVEN: Why? 
4620,"SARA: Well, it looks like a control room. The Daleks wouldn't leave a"
4621,place like this unguarded. 
4622,"STEVEN: Yes, that's true. That means they must have the Doctor if they"
4623,"can be this sure of themselves. Hey, isn't this their time machine? "
4624,SARA: Now we can get back to Earth and warn them. 
4625,"STEVEN: Yes, except that neither of us knows how to work it. We could"
4626,bluff them. 
4627,SARA: How? 
4628,STEVEN: If we could lock ourselves inside their time machine until they
4629,"let the Doctor come to us. Well, he could work it. "
4630,SARA: It's worth a try. Now we've got to contact the Daleks. Steven!
4631,Here's the Dalek loudspeaker system. This is Sara Kingdom of Space

4645,CHEN: I don't know! You must let me speak to them!

4666,"STEVEN: No, I don't think so. Look, if there were any Daleks around"
4667,they'd be here by now. They must have gone. Maybe the Doctor's with the

4674,CHEN: It's not a trick! 
4675,DELEGATE: Then why have they come back! 
4676,CHEN: If you'd only think! Is there no sense in the outer galaxies? It
4677,"is clear that they have lost their leader, the one they call the"
4678,"Doctor. The girl has bought the young man here to look for him, but"
4679,really she has come back out of loyalty to me. To ensure my safety as

4703,CELATION: If he is your leader he is not with us. 
4704,STEVEN: Where is he? 
4705,CHEN: I don't know. Now let us out! 
4706,STEVEN: So that you can rejoin the Daleks! Not likely. 
4707,CELATION: Absurd! The Daleks have betrayed us! 
4708,DELEGATE: Betrayed! 
4709,CELATION: Why should we rejoin them? 
4710,"SARA: If we let them out, there's just a chance that some of them could"
4711,mobilise a force to defeat the Daleks. 
4712,DELEGATE: Of course we will! 
4713,CELATION: You must! The Daleks must be destroyed. All our galaxies are
4714,in danger! 
4715,SARA: We have no choice. 
4716,STEVEN: Very well. But the Daleks have already left Kembel. It's
4717,probable that their invasion plans are already going ahead and the
4718,universe can be taken by surprise because of your greed! 
4719,CHEN: Must you moralise at us? 
4720,STEVEN: Your only chance is to go back to your own people and warn
4721,them. 
4722,DELEGATE: Our people will kill us! 
4723,CELATION: Not if we save them. We must destroy the Daleks.

4726,for the Dalek invasion force.

4764,"(Following at a safe distance, Steven and Sara track the Dalek to a"
4765,steep ramp that leads to a tunnel mouth at the base of a mountain.) 
4766,"STEVEN: It went down there, right into the heart of the mountain. "
4767,SARA: Underground. Why didn't we think of that before? 
4768,"STEVEN: Sara, it's possible the invasion hasn't started yet. Maybe the"
4769,rest of the forces are down there. 
4770,SARA: Or part of them. There must be hundreds of places like that. 
4771,"STEVEN: Yes, but that Dalek must know that the representatives got"
4772,away. 
4773,SARA: They might even know that we're on Kembel. 
4774,"STEVEN: With the representatives gone and the Doctor disappeared, we're"
4775,going to have to put them out of action ourselves.

4797,SARA: He's mad! 
4798,"CHEN: Take care, Kingdom. I could easily forgo the pleasure of giving"
4799,you to the Daleks. I could kill you myself. 
4800,STEVEN: Why did you come back? This couldn't have been planned. You
4801,weren't to know that we'd come back and set you free. 
4802,CHEN: I'm not a fool. I guessed your plan. 
4803,SARA: Our only plan is to destroy the Daleks.

4811,don't you believe us? We don't know where he is. 
4812,CHEN: Yet I find you at the entrance to the Daleks' secret
4813,headquarters. I know the Doctor's here and that he's trying to take my
4814,place. But I'll soon change that. 
4815,STEVEN: Why can't you understand the Daleks do not make allies? 
4816,"SARA: Save your breath, Steven, you'll never convince him. I tell you,"

5098,unharmed by the blast. Hurricane force winds spin the Daleks around and
5099,"out of control. As time continues to race backwards, the Daleks start"
5100,"to decay. Their metal casings split and melt away, briefly revealing"
5101,"the clawed mutants inside. Helpless, the creatures scream, reduce to"
5102,embryonic state then turn to dust. The ground shudders and heaves.) 
5103,"(After a time, the Doctor and Steven emerge from the Tardis. The"
5104,landscape of Kembel has been devastated and reshaped beyond all
5105,recognition.) 
5106,"DOCTOR: Oh, dust. Nothing but dust! "
5107,(Steven finds a chunk of twisted rusting metal lying on the ground.) 
5108,"STEVEN: The time destructor, what's left of it. "
5109,DOCTOR: Mavic Chen's taranium core has finally burnt itself out. 
5110,STEVEN: I wish Sara could have seen the end. 
5111,"DOCTOR: Yes, my boy, so do I. You know, Steven, the one thing that Sara"
5112,"lived for was to see the total destruction of the Daleks. Well, now"
5113,"it's all over. Without her help, this could never have been achieved. "
5114,(The Doctor notices something in the sand and reaches down to scoop it
5115,up in his hand.) 
5116,STEVEN: What is it? 
5117,DOCTOR: Millions of years of progress reversed back. 
5118,(The Doctor opens his hand to show Steven a tiny dead embryo.) 
5119,DOCTOR: That's all that remains of a Dalek. 
5120,"STEVEN: Let's go, Doctor. I've seen enough of this place. "
5121,"DOCTOR: Well, my boy, we finally rid this planet of Daleks. "
5122,"STEVEN: Bret, Katarina, Sara. "
5123,DOCTOR: What a waste. What a terrible waste.
