20,One 
21, [Circus]
22,
23, (A little man in a bowler hat watches the
24,customers enter the big top of the International Circus. He walks round
25,"the back, past the lion's cage and finds a quiet spot to light up a"
26,small cigar. We hear the sound of the Tardis materialising and a motor
27,"horse box suddenly appears in the open ground before him. Agog, the man"
28,walks over and looks round it while a trim man in black suit and
29,"gloves, and with a neat beard gets out.) "
30,ROSSINI: (Italian) Who the heck are you? Well? 
31,MASTER: I am usually referred to as the Master. 
32,ROSSINI: Oh? Is that so? 
33,MASTER: Universally. 
34,"ROSSINI: Well, I am Luigi Rossini, internationally, and conjurers I"
35,don't need. Okay? 
36,"MASTER: Unfortunately I need you, Lew Russell. "
37,ROSSINI: (London) What did you call me? 
38,MASTER: Lew Russell. It happens to be your real name. 
39,"ROSSINI: Now listen, Mister. Get off my pitch while you're still safe!."
40,
41,"MASTER: Why, you insolent primitive. "
42,"ROSSINI: Oh, so you it want the hard way, do you? Right. "
43,"(Rossini goes to grab the Master, but it is his wrist that is taken in a vice-like"
44,grip. Rossini is forced to his knees and their eyes meet. After a few
45,"moments the Master lets Rossini go and walks a few steps, then snaps"
46,his fingers. Rossini gets up and follows.)
47,
48, [National Space Museum]
49,
50, (The Master breaks a display case containing a
51,Nestene sphere.) 
52,"MUSEUM ATTENDANT: Here, you! What do you think you're doing? "
53,(Rossini knocks the attendant out.)
54,
55, [UNIT Laboratory]
56,
57, (The Doctor is working inside the Tardis.) 
58,DOCTOR : (sings) I don't want to set the world on fire! 
59,"(Bang! and smoke comes out of the open Tardis door, followed by the"
60,Doctor carrying a piece of dematerialisation mechanism. He goes to the
61,lab bench and places it in a device clearly designed to hold the three
62,legged item. There is a knock at the door.) 
63,"DOCTOR: Not today, thank you. "
64,"(Jo Grant enters, carrying a file.) "
65,"JO: Doctor, I, er "
66,"DOCTOR: I said not today, thank you. "
67,(The Doctor switches on his contraption and it goes fizz. There is more
68,smoke.) 
69,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. "
70,(Jo grabs a fire extinguisher and uses it on the contraption.) 
71,DOCTOR: Oh no! 
72,JO: It's all right. I've dealt with it. 
73,DOCTOR: Dealt with it? You've ruined it! 
74,JO: But your bench was on fire. 
75,"DOCTOR: Three months delicate work and now look at it, you ham-fisted"
76,bungler. 
77,JO: But this whole place might have gone up in flames. 
78,"DOCTOR: My dear young lady, steady state micro-welding always creates"
79,more smoke than fire. 
80,JO: Steady state micro-welding? 
81,DOCTOR: Yes. An advanced engineering technique pioneered by the
82,Lammerdenes. A remarkably gifted race. They have nine opposable digits.
83,
84,JO: Nine what? 
85,"DOCTOR: Nine opposable digits. Yes, well, never mind. Look, I said I"
86,"don't want any tea today, thank you. "
87,JO: I'm not the tea lady. 
88,DOCTOR: Then what the blazes are you doing in here? 
89,JO: I've 
90,DOCTOR: Don't you know this area is strictly out of bounds to everybody
91,except the tea lady and the Brigadier's personal staff? 
92,JO: I'm your new assistant. 
93,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. "
94,"JO: The Brigadier sent me along to introduce myself, Doctor. Josephine"
95,Grant. 
96,"DOCTOR: How do you do, Miss Grant? I really don't think you're"
97,suitable. 
98,"JO: I'm a fully qualified agent, you know. Cryptology, safe breaking,"
99,explosives. 
100,"DOCTOR: Fire fighting? Yes, well, I'm sorry, my dear, but what I need"
101,is a scientist. 
102,JO: I took general science at A-Level. 
103,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sure you did, but, even so. "
104,JO: I'm sorry I ruined your experiment. 
105,DOCTOR: That's all right. 
106,(Jo brings the file over to the bench.) 
107,"DOCTOR: Look, Miss Grant, I've got a great deal of work to do. You must"
108,excuse me. 
109,JO: The Brigadier wanted me to show you this report. 
110,DOCTOR: Mmm? 
111,JO: Something was stolen for the Natural Space Museum. It was on loan
112,from this HQ. 
113,"DOCTOR: Oh, what was? "
114,"JO: A translucent polyhedron, eight and a half inches in diameter. "
115,(The Doctor grabs the file.) 
116,"DOCTOR: Well, that's the Nestene's energy unit. It should never have"
117,left this building. 
118,JO: Apparently they wanted it for a special display. The Brigadier
119,signed the authorisation. 
120,DOCTOR: The Brigadier's an idiot! I knew I should have destroyed that
121,thing but somehow it would have felt like murder. 
122,JO: You mean it was alive? 
123,"DOCTOR: Yes, in a way. Yes, that container held a form of alien"
124,intelligence. 
125,JO: But you've just got to be joking. 
126,"DOCTOR: There's precious little to joke about, Miss Grant. That thing"
127,is appallingly dangerous. 
128,JO: But who would want to steal it? 
129,DOCTOR: Exactly. Who and why?
130,
131, [Beacon Hill Telescope Control]
132,
133, (Two radio telescopes and several microwave relay
134,towers are dotted about at the site of the Ministry of Technology's
135,Beacon Hill Research Establishment. A man in a brown suit climbs the
136,long metal staircases to a control cabin in amongst them and enters.
137,The bearded man in a white lab coat speaks first.) 
138,GOODGE: I told her again last night. 
139,PHILIPS: Hmm? 
140,"GOODGE: Elsie. Cut out the hard-boiled eggs, I said. Quite apart from"
141,"their effects on my digestion, they're aesthetically boring. "
142,PHILIPS: Uh huh. 
143,(Goodge takes a paper tape printout from a computer as the Master looks
144,in through the window.) 
145,GOODGE: Here you are. 
146,"PHILIPS: Oh, thank you, Goodge. "
147,GOODGE: Will there be anything else? 
148,"PHILIPS: Er, not for the moment. Oh, by the way, talking of eggs, I"
149,want a four hour scan below the hydrogen line tomorrow. 
150,GOODGE: All right. 
151,PHILIPS: I'll give you the precise wavelength later. 
152,(Philips leaves and heads back to the ground. Goodge gets out his
153,thermos and lunch box. There are two hard boiled eggs in with his
154,sandwich. The Master enters and points a light-emitting device at the
155,back of Goodge's head. A sort of evil sonic screwdriver. Philips
156,arrives in the main control room as the Master brings a UNIT ammo box
157,into telescope control and takes out the Nestene energy unit. He plugs
158,it into a control panel then reorients the radio telescopes.)
159,
160, [Beacon Hill Main Control]
161,
162, (An oscilloscope starts up. Philips gets on the
163,intercom.) 
164,PHILIPS: Goodge! What the blazes is happening?
165,
166, [Beacon Hill Telescope Control]
167,
168," PHILIPS : Goodge, do you hear me? "
169,(The energy unit is active.)
170,
171, [Beacon Hill Main Control]
172,
173, PHILIPS: The shaft angling code has gone crazy.
174,"Are you there, man? Check the feed back control!"
175,
176, [Beacon Hill Telescope Control]
177,
178, (The signal peaks and the Master switches off the
179,telescope controls. The energy sphere is beeping very quickly.) 
180,PHILIPS : Goodge! What the devil do you think you're playing at? 
181,(Philips enters and is transfixed by the Master's Look.)
182,
183, [UNIT Laboratory]
184,
185, BRIGADIER: You've been agitating for a new
186,assistant ever since Miss Shaw went back to Cambridge. 
187,DOCTOR: Liz was a highly qualified scientist. I want someone with the
188,same qualifications. 
189,"BRIGADIER: Nonsense. What you need, Doctor, as Miss Shaw herself so"
190,"often remarked, is someone to pass you your test tubes and to tell you"
191,how brilliant you are. Miss Grant will fulfil that function admirably. 
192,"DOCTOR: Well, what's the girl doing here anyway? UNIT's no place for"
193,trainees. 
194,"BRIGADIER: No, I couldn't agree more, Doctor, but Miss Grant was very"
195,keen to join us and she happens to have relatives in high places. 
196,"DOCTOR: So you tried to palm her off onto me. Well, it won't work,"
197,Brigadier. I'll have a properly qualified assistant or none at all. 
198,"BRIGADIER: Very well, Doctor. I'll reassign her. "
199,DOCTOR: Good. 
200,BRIGADIER: But I think you should break the news to her yourself. 
201,"DOCTOR: Well, now, wait a minute. "
202,(Jo enters.) 
203,"JO: Hi, Doc. I. Good morning, sir. "
204,"BRIGADIER: Good morning, Miss Grant. "
205,JO: I've checked all incoming reports. Still nothing on the stolen
206,meteorite. 
207,BRIGADIER: Thank you. 
208,JO: And I've chased those electronic spares you wanted. They promised
209,"delivery tomorrow, without fail. "
210,"DOCTOR: Miss Grant, I, er, I, er. Well, I don't. This is, er, a bit"
211,"difficult for me to say but. Er. Thank you, Jo. I can see you're going"
212,to be of great help to me. 
213,"JO: Thank you, Doctor. Report from one our field sections, sir. Captain"
214,Yates. Some kind of sabotage at a radio telescope. Two of their
215,scientists have disappeared. 
216,DOCTOR: Let me see that. (reads) We'd better get down there right away.
217,
218, [Beacon Hill]
219,
220," (The Doctor, the Brigadier and Jo arrive in"
221,Bessie.) 
222,"YATES: The Director's expecting you, sir. "
223,DOCTOR: Is that where the sabotage took place? 
224,"YATES: No, sir. It seems to have happened in the control cabin in the"
225,top of that tower. 
226,"DOCTOR: Well, that's where you'll find me then. No, Miss Grant. You"
227,stay here with the Brigadier.
228,
229, [Beacon Hill Main Control]
230,
231, YATES: Director? Miss Josephine Grant and
232,Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart of UNIT. 
233,JO: Good morning. 
234,
235, [Beacon Hill Telescope Control]
236,
237, (The Doctor is about to enter when there is a
238,materialisation sound. A man in a pin-stripe suit with bowler hat and
239,furled umbrella appears in mid air.) 
240,"TIME LORD: Oh, dear. Don't go away, Doctor. My co-ordinates seem to"
241,"have slipped a little. Still, not bad after twenty nine thousand light"
242,years. 
243,(He glides to the gantry.) 
244,"TIME LORD: I do hope you can spare a moment or two, Doctor? "
245,"DOCTOR: Sarcasm always was a weak point with you, wasn't it. May I say"
246,that I think you look quite ridiculous in those clothes. 
247,TIME LORD: I am travelling incognito. 
248,DOCTOR: Oh? Why? 
249,"TIME LORD: We Time Lords don't care to be conspicuous. Some of us, that"
250,is. 
251,"DOCTOR: Look, if you've come down merely to be rude "
252,TIME LORD: I came to warn you. An old acquaintance has arrived on this
253,planet. 
254,DOCTOR: Oh? One of our people? 
255,TIME LORD: The Master. 
256,DOCTOR: That jackanapes! All he ever does is cause trouble. 
257,"TIME LORD: He'll certainly try to kill you, Doctor. The tribunal"
258,thought that you ought to be made aware of your danger. 
259,DOCTOR: How very kind of them. 
260,"TIME LORD: You are incorrigibly meddlesome, Doctor, but we've always"
261,felt that your hearts are in the right places. But be careful. The
262,Master has learnt a great deal since you last met him. 
263,"DOCTOR: I refuse to be worried by a renegade like the Master. He's a,"
264,he's an unimaginative plodder. 
265,TIME LORD: His degree in cosmic science was of a higher class than
266,yours. 
267,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, er, yes, well, I, I was a late developer. "
268,TIME LORD: Would you call that little surprise unimaginative? 
269,DOCTOR: What? 
270,"TIME LORD: Look through the door, but be careful. "
271,(We can see a string running across the cabin through the window. The
272,Doctor carefully opens the door a crack to see that it runs from the
273,top of the door to a cylinder balanced on the console.) 
274,DOCTOR: A volatiser. If that thing should fall 
275,TIME LORD: It'll explode and probably destroy this research centre
276,"completely. You see, he's rigged it up so that it opening the door will"
277,make it fall. Such an amusing idea. 
278,"DOCTOR: Well, you'd better think of a witty way of dealing with it. "
279,(The dematerialisation sound.) 
280,DOCTOR: Now wait! 
281,"TIME LORD: Oh, good luck! "
282,(The Time Lord vanishes. The Doctor reopens the door a little and feels
283,"for the end of the string, then he steps back, bursts in and catches"
284,the volatiser just before it hits the floor.)
285,
286, [Beacon Hill Telescope Control]
287,
288,(The Doctor unscrews the top of the cylinder.) 
289,YATES: Any luck? 
290,DOCTOR: Keep back. 
291,YATES: What's that? 
292,DOCTOR: A bomb. 
293,YATES: A bomb! Is it defused? 
294,DOCTOR: It is now. 
295,"YATES: Where on earth did you find it? Oh, I'm so sorry. Er, this is"
296,the Director. 
297,DIRECTOR: How do you do? I hope you realise the police have already
298,investigated this matter. 
299,DOCTOR: Where's Lethbridge Stewart? 
300,YATES: He and Miss Grant are questioning the staff. 
301,DOCTOR: Huh. A fat lot of use that'll do. 
302,"DIRECTOR: After all, it's hardly an international matter, is it? "
303,DOCTOR: I understand you've lost a couple of scientists. 
304,"DIRECTOR: Yes. Professor Philips and his assistant, Goodge. "
305,(The Doctor picks up the half eaten hard-boiled egg from the table.) 
306,DIRECTOR: Goodge must have left in quite a hurry. 
307,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, he must. "
308,(The Doctor opens the sandwich box.) 
309,"DOCTOR: Oh, no! "
310,YATES: What's wrong? 
311,DOCTOR: Look for yourself. 
312,DIRECTOR: It's Goodge! 
313,(Goodge's tiny figure is slumped against the side of the box.)
314,
315, [Factory office]
316,
317, (The Master is in a more conventional business
318,suit.) 
319,"MASTER: I'm very glad that you could see me at such short notice,"
320,Mister Farrel. 
321,"FARREL: Well, your telephone call was pretty intriguing, Colonel. Er,"
322,do sit down. 
323,"MASTER: Oh, thank you. "
324,"FARREL: Er, we, er, do have a little spare capacity at the moment. "
325,"MASTER: I would say more than a little, considering that your plant has"
326,been working at less than half volume for over a year. 
327,"FARREL: I see you've done your homework, Colonel. Well, I, er, admit I"
328,was interested when you mentioned a steady repeat demand. 
329,"MASTER: The people I represent, Mister Farrel, can never have too much"
330,plastic.
331,
332, [UNIT Laboratory]
333,
334, JO: What is a Nestene? 
335,DOCTOR: Ask Captain Yates. He had the job of clearing up the mess last
336,time. 
337,"JO: Well, what is a Nestene? "
338,"YATES: Oh, a Nestene? Er, it's a bit difficult to describe, exactly. "
339,DOCTOR: A Nestene is a ruthlessly aggressive intelligent alien life
340,form. 
341,"JO: Well, what do they look like? "
342,DOCTOR: Well I expect myself their basic form is analogous to a
343,cephalopod. 
344,JO: What's a cephalopod? 
345,DOCTOR: An octopus. I thought you took an A-Level in science. 
346,"JO: I didn't say I passed. Urgh, an octopus. "
347,"DOCTOR: They manifest themselves as a disembodied, mutually telepathic"
348,intelligence. 
349,"JO: But if they're disembodied, how can they hurt us? "
350,YATES: They make themselves bodies when they need them. 
351,JO: You mean like Frankenstein? 
352,(The Doctor puts on a heat reflective apron and gloves.) 
353,"DOCTOR: No. They have a natural affinity for plastic. Now, if you've"
354,quite finished asking questions? 
355,JO: Sorry. Just forget I'm here. 
356,YATES: At least we should be ready for them this time. 
357,"DOCTOR: Too late, Captain. They're here already. "
358,JO: What? 
359,DOCTOR: The radio telescope is their bridgehead. They used that to
360,contain energy into that surviving Nestene unit. 
361,(The Brigadier enters.) 
362,"DOCTOR: Brigadier. Look, that unit must be discovered within the next"
363,hour. 
364,"BRIGADIER: Yes, I'm well aware of the urgency of the situation, Doctor."
365,If we had some idea where its been taken. 
366,"DOCTOR: Well, try the plastics factories, man. "
367,BRIGADIER: Yes. I'll set up a search straight away. Yates. 
368,"YATES: Right, sir. "
369,"JO: Can I help, sir? Please? "
370,"BRIGADIER: Very well, Miss Grant. "
371,JO: I'll start by making out some lists.
372,
373, [Factory office]
374,
375, (Farrel is getting the full benefit of the
376,Master's Look.) 
377,MASTER: You will obey me and no one else. Do you understand? 
378,FARREL: I shall obey. I shall obey. I shall obey.
379,
380, [UNIT Laboratory]
381,
382, BRIGADIER: And you're convinced this man is
383,working with the Nestenes? 
384,"DOCTOR: Oh, I should think by now he'll be calling himself their"
385,"Commander in Chief. Vanity's his weakness. Ah, there you are. It should"
386,be cooked by now. 
387,(The Doctor opens a kiln and takes out the cylinder.) 
388,"BRIGADIER: This, er, this device of his. Is it very powerful? "
389,"DOCTOR: Oh, I should say roughly equal to a fifteen megaton bomb. "
390,"BRIGADIER: Really? Well, the research boys'll be glad to get their"
391,hands on this. 
392,"DOCTOR: Too late, Brigadier. I've boiled out the contents. The weapons"
393,that you have on Earth are quite nasty enough as it is.
394,
395, [Plastics Factory]
396,
397, (The Master attaches the energy unit to a piece of
398,machinery and walks off. Farrel follows as they go outside. Meanwhile
399,Jo is running across the top of a brick regaining wall at the bottom of
400,a grass bank.) 
401,MASTER: Now the computer. 
402,FARREL: This way. 
403,(Jo hides behind a convenient pile of milk crates as the two men walk
404,"towards her, talking.) "
405,MASTER: I see. Excellent. 
406,FARREL: What are you going to do? 
407,MASTER: I wish to alter the masterplan. 
408,FARREL: But that would change our whole production lines! 
409,MASTER: Naturally. 
410,FARREL: My father would never dream of allowing 
411,"MASTER: My dear Mister Farrel, don't worry about him. You are under a"
412,new thumb now. 
413,(They walk past Jo's hiding place. She gets up to see where they are
414,going and knocks off some small boxes.) 
415,"JO: Oh, hello. "
416,(The Master stares at her.)
417,
418, [Factory office]
419,
420, MASTER: Who went to the Radio Telescope Station? 
421,"JO: Myself, the Brigadier and The Doctor. "
422,"MASTER: As I thought. Curiosity is his weakness. Well, I should have to"
423,see that it's satisfied. You will return to UNIT with a negative
424,report. You found nothing suspicious. Everything was in order. 
425,JO: Yes. Everything in order. 
426,"MASTER: When you leave this room you will have no memory of meeting me,"
427,only Mister Farrel. 
428,JO: Only Mister Farrel. 
429,MASTER: Your instructions are already implanted. You will obey them
430,without a further word from me. 
431,JO: I shall obey. 
432,MASTER: Good.

434, [UNIT Laboratory]
435,
436," YATES: Yes, what is it, Sergeant? "
437,"BENTON: Excuse me, sir. We've just had a call from the civil police."
438,They found Philip's car abandoned. 
439,YATES: Where? 
440,"BENTON: In a field about nine miles away from the research station, and"
441,they say there's a zinc box in the boot with UNIT markings. 
442,YATES: The energy unit? 
443,"BENTON: I've told them not to touch it, Doctor. "
444,"YATES: What do you think, Doctor? "
445,DOCTOR: I still am. 
446,YATES: Huh? 
447,DOCTOR: Thinking.

449, [Factory office]
450,
451, McDERMOTT: (Irish) I think you'd better go home.
452,"Sure, look, I know all our customers and there isn't a Colonel Masters"
453,amongst them. 
454,"FARREL: You're quite wrong, James. He's taking over our entire"
455,production at the moment. 
456,"McDERMOTT: Entire? Here, look, I'll tell you what, Rex. Now look, you"
457,"go through those orders, yes? And you show me this chap. Go on. "
458,FARREL: All right. 
459,(Farrel opens a drawer full of large card files. His head hurts.) 
460,FARREL: I don't understand. There should be a card for him! 
461,"McDERMOTT: Look Rex, I think you ought to take a couple of days off."
462,I'll ring your father and he can come 
463,"FARREL: May I remind you, Mister McDermott, that my father is retired."
464,I'm running this place now. 
465,"McDERMOTT: Your father built this place up from nothing. Sure, I"
466,"remember when I was a wee lad, he "
467,"FARREL: All right, all right, all right! Let's not go over all that"
468,again. 
469,"McDERMOTT: Look, I'm sorry, Rex, but I especially promised your father"
470,I would 
471,"FARREL: There's no need to bring father into it! Look, I'll go and"
472,fetch him. He's only down in the lab. 
473,McDERMOTT: Who? 
474,"FARREL: Colonel Masters, of course. He'll explain everything. "
475,(Farrel leaves. McDermott picks up the telephone.) 
476,"McDERMOTT: Sylvia? Get me Mister Farrel senior, please."

518,DOCTOR: Almost certainly post-hypnotic alienation. 
519,YATES: She's been hypnotised? 
520,"DOCTOR: Well, of course. Why else do you think she tried to blow us all"
521,"to pieces? Come on, my dear, come and sit down over here. Get a chair,"
522,"Captain Yates. Come on, you sit down here. There. Good. "
523,"YATES: Well, I understood that under hypnosis it was impossible for "
524,DOCTOR: You thought that under hypnosis it was impossible for a subject
525,to be persuaded to do anything that was against his nature? 
526,YATES: That's right. 
527,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a fallacy, Captain. The Master can completely"
528,control the human mind. 
529,BENTON: So he can just take over anyone he likes? 
530,"DOCTOR: No, not quite. No, some minds are stubborn enough to resist"
531,"hypnosis. In any case, it doesn't last. Away from the Master's"
532,"influence, the mind struggles constantly to free itself. "
533,YATES: Is she in some sort of a trance? 
534,DOCTOR: I think the current jargon is schizoid dissociation. It's
535,because she was forced to do something against her will and her
536,conscious mind refuses to accept the fact. The result is a deep trauma.

579,"MASTER: It's a very clumsy operation, this. You can see now why this"

957,DOCTOR: It isn't exactly a horsebox. It just happens to look like one. 
958,JO: You mean there isn't a horse inside. 
959,DOCTOR: No more than there's a policeman inside my police box. 
960,JO: So what do we do now? 
961,DOCTOR: Well 
962,"(Philips enters, brandishing a silver rod in his hand.) "
963,"DOCTOR: Wait! Philips, wait! Don't move, Jo. "
964,JO: What's he holding?

966,about to commit murder. 
967,PHILIPS: I must. He said I must! 
968,DOCTOR: Wait. You just listen. The Master is controlling your mind. You

1064,MASTER: Because the Doctor's escaped again? No. He's an interesting

1082,"a course of action. That is, of course, unless you have something of"
1083,greater importance to attend to? 
1084,"DOCTOR: No, no, of course not. No, do carry on, it's most interesting. "
1085,BRIGADIER: Thank you. Where was I? 
1086,"YATES: Ten, sir. "
1087,BRIGADIER: Ten. The enemy intention 
1088,DOCTOR: The enemy intention is to occupy your planet. I should have
1089,thought that was quite obvious. 
1090,BRIGADIER: To do that they will have to land additional forces. In
1091,"other words, this is no more than a diversionary thrust. Do you agree,"

1095,"BRIGADIER: We have, as you know, raided the circus and arrested Rossini"
1096,and his thugs. And what have we learned from them? 
1097,DOCTOR: Nothing. Rossini is just a tool. The Master used him and then
1098,discarded him. 
1099,BRIGADIER: There was no sign of alien activity at the circus. This
1100,mysterious horsebox had vanished. So had the Autons.

1102,BRIGADIER: Not quite.

1120,"JO: He did save our lives, you know. Well? Didn't he? "
1121,"DOCTOR: You're quite right, Jo. I'll apologise, if I have the time. "
1122,JO: What are those things? 
1123,"DOCTOR: Well, that is the discarded circuit from my Tardis and this is"
1124,"an identical circuit that I, er, borrowed from the Master's horsebox. "

1140,"DOCTOR: Well, my Tardis uses a mark one dematerialisation circuit and I"
1141,tried to replace it with a mark two. 
1142,(The Doctor laughs.) 
1143,JO: What's the joke?

1354,"YATES: He's right you know, Doctor. I'd better come with you. "
1355,BRIGADIER: No! I shall accompany the Doctor myself. I'm not entirely
1356,"deskbound yet, you know and I "
1357,YATES: Sir 
1358,"BRIGADIER: That will do, Captain Yates! May I remind you that you're"
1359,"duty officer today. If you're ready, Doctor? "
1360,(The Brigadier leaves.) 
1361,"DOCTOR: Jo, nobody is to touch that thing until I've had the chance of"
1362,"examining it properly, all right? "
1363,"JO: Don't worry, I won't go anywhere near it. Yuk!"

1366,
1367, AUTON: We will leave now. 
1368,"FARREL: No, not until the Master returns. "
1369,AUTON: We shall leave without him. We must keep to schedule. 
1370,"FARREL: For the last time, no! "
1371,(The telephone engineer opens the coach door.)

1377, (Yates has put a piece of metal on a tripod over a
1378,bunsen burner.) 
1379,"YATES: Until you've had a mug of army cocoa, you just haven't lived. "
1380,"JO: You know, I don't think the Doctor would approve of that. "
1381,YATES: What? 
1382,JO: Making free with his Bunsen burner. Hello? Scientific supplies
1383,section? I'd like to speak to Mister Campbell please. 
1384,YATES: Then he shouldn't go gallivanting off leaving me stuck here. 
1385,"JO: What about me? I'm stuck here too, you know. "
1386,"YATES: Oh well, that's different, isn't it? I'll just go and fetch the"
1387,gubbins. 
1388,(Yates leaves.) 
1389,"JO: Thank you and good night, Captain Yates. Hello? Mister Campbell?"
1390,"Oh, I see. No, no, I'll hang on. Will he be long? "

1400,urgently so I thought 
1401,(The dwarf rolls over and gets onto its feet.) 
1402,"JO: Yes, that's quite true, but if anybody could, you could. You're"
1403,"dead right, we'd be in terrible trouble. Could you? Could you really?"
1404,"You're a dolly Scotsman, Mister Campbell. Yes, of course."

1415,"misses, falling to the floor.) "
1416,"JO: Mike! Mike, come quickly! "
1417,"(Yates enters with two mugs and a jar of cocoa in one hand, fumbling"
1418,for his service revolver with the other.) 
1419,YATES: Jo! What's the matter? 
1420,"(Yates shoots the dwarf, each shot blasting the solid plastic and"
1421,breaking off limbs.)

1423, [Factory office]
1424,
1425, BRIGADIER: Seems as though they've moved camp. 
1426,DOCTOR: Yes. Today. 
1427,"BRIGADIER: Oh, how do you know that? "
1428,DOCTOR: Desk calendar. Hello? 
1429,(He picks a daffodil up from the floor.) 
1430,BRIGADIER: What have you got there? 
1431,"DOCTOR: A daffodil. A plastic daffodil. Hang onto it for me, will you? "
1432,BRIGADIER: What do you want it for? They give these things away with
1433,soap. 
1434,"DOCTOR: It's plastic, Brigadier, and any plastic artefact, anything at"
1435,"all, can, in the Nestene sense of the word, be alive. First a doll,"
1436,then a flower. 
1437,"BRIGADIER: What are you getting at, Doctor? "
1438,DOCTOR: I wish I knew. 
1439,(The Doctor goes over to a large safe set in the wall and sets about
1440,the combination lock.) 
1441,"DOCTOR: Oh, have a look at that desk, old chap, will you? "
1442,BRIGADIER: Yes. 
1443,"DOCTOR: You never know, there might be something there to give us a"
1444,lead. 
1445,"BRIGADIER: Oh, nothing much here. Unless this might be something. "
1446,DOCTOR: Mmm? 
1447,BRIGADIER: Farrel's ordered a coach this week. A fifteen-seater. 
1448,"DOCTOR: Well, maybe he's going on a works outing. "
1449,BRIGADIER: Yeah. 
1450,(The Brigadier shuts the office door and starts looking through files
1451,"in a cabinet next to it. The Doctor opens the safe, which contains an"
1452,Auton with its weapon hand primed.) 
1453,DOCTOR: Look out! Auton! 
1454,"(The Auton shoots, just missing the Brigadier as he ducks. The Doctor"
1455,slams the safe door shut and turns the dial.) 
1456,"DOCTOR: Remarkably persistent, aren't they."

1458, [UNIT Laboratory]
1459,
1460, BRIGADIER: This thing actually attacked you? 
1461,JO: It was going to if Mike hadn't shot it. It was horrible. 
1462,"BRIGADIER: Seems as though you may be right, Doctor. "
1463,DOCTOR: I usually am. 
1464,"BRIGADIER: Well, it's dead enough now. "
1465,"DOCTOR: Jo, where were you when this thing started moving? "
1466,JO: I was on the telephone. 
1467,"DOCTOR: And what about you, Captain Yates? "
1468,"YATES: I wasn't here. I'd just gone out to, er, fetch some cocoa. "
1469,"DOCTOR: Yes, well something must have. Fetch a tin of what? "
1470,YATES: Cocoa. 
1471,DOCTOR: Are you trying to tell me that you were going to make cocoa in
1472,my lab? 
1473,"YATES: That was the general idea. I'm sorry, Doctor. "
1474,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, Sergeant. (pause) Now wait a minute. You didn't by"
1475,"any chance use my bunsen burner, did you? "
1476,"YATES: Well, yes. "
1477,DOCTOR: Well that's it then. Heat! This thing was lying alongside my
1478,bunsen. It must be triggered off by a pre-determined temperature. 
1479,"BRIGADIER: Yes, that may account for Farrel's death, Doctor. What about"
1480,all the others? 
1481,"DOCTOR: If this thing is what I think it is, we may have the answer"
1482,"right here. Right, off you go, the whole lot of you. "
1483,(The Brigadier and Yates leave.) 
1484,"JO: Me, too? "
1485,"DOCTOR: Yes, you too. No. No, you go down to the stores and see if you"
1486,"can chase up that Mister Campbell, all right? "
1487,JO: Okay. 
1488,(Jo leaves. The Doctor hangs his cape on the stand from the Tardis and
1489,the telephone rings.)

1517, DOCTOR: The cable. Pull it out! Pull it out! 
1518,(The Brigadier pulls the phone wire from the socket. The Master hears
1519,the line being disconnected and turns off his device. The Brigadier
1520,unwraps the Doctor.) 
1521,"BRIGADIER: You all right, Doctor? "
1522,"DOCTOR: Yes, more or less. "
1523,BRIGADIER: I'm afraid I cut your connection. 
1524,"DOCTOR: Oh, very amusing. "
1525,BRIGADIER: What happened? 
1526,"DOCTOR: Well, remember what I told you, Brigadier? The Nestenes can put"
1527,life into anything made of plastic. Anything at all. 
1528,BRIGADIER: I see. And there's a lot of plastic around. 
1529,(The coach drives past a motor bike waiting in the bushes. The rider
1530,starts it up and follows. The Doctor is testing his head theory on the
1531,daffodil.) 
1532,YATES: Doctor? Doctor? 
1533,(Nothing happens so the Doctor puts the bunsen burner down.) 
1534,"DOCTOR: Well, I was wrong. It isn't heat. Well? "
1535,YATES: Message from the Brigadier. 
1536,DOCTOR: What is it this time? 
1537,YATES: It's about these daffodils. 
1538,DOCTOR: What about them? 
1539,YATES: You remember we had a report of a plastics promotion tour? 
1540,DOCTOR: Mmm hmm. 
1541,"YATES: Well, er, they're handing out daffodils. "
1542,DOCTOR: Who are? 
1543,"YATES: Chaps in weird carnival masks, touring round in a coach. "
1544,DOCTOR: Did they say how many they'd given out? 
1545,"YATES: No, they didn't. We've got no idea at all, I'm afraid. We don't"
1546,"even know how long they've been doing it. The thing is, the Brigadier"
1547,wants to know if the daffs are dangerous. 
1548,"DOCTOR: That, Captain Yates, is what I'm trying to find out."
1549,
1550, [Brigadier's office]
1551,
1552, (The Brigadier is on the phone.) 
1553,"BRIGADIER: Excellent. Where was it? Well, give me the grid reference."
1554,"Yeah. No, just maintain contact. I want to tackle them in open country."
1555,Good. Keep me informed. 
1556,(He makes a second call.) 
1557,"BRIGADIER: Lethbridge Stewart here, I want a call to the RAF please."
1558,Priority red one. Strike command.
1559,
1560, [UNIT Laboratory]
1561,
1562," DOCTOR: Excuse me, Jo. "
1563,(The Doctor puts a slide with a piece of daffodil onto a small
1564,contraption on the bench.) 
1565,JO: What are you doing? 
1566,DOCTOR: This is a section of that daffodil. I'm trying to find out its
1567,molecular structure. 
1568,(The results start to come up on a monitor.) 
1569,DOCTOR: No. 
1570,(A series of hexagons appear.) 
1571,"DOCTOR: Hello, what's this? A programme pattern. "
1572,JO: A programme pattern? 
1573,"DOCTOR: Yes, these daffodils have their instructions imprinted on every"
1574,"cell. It's a weapon of some sort, but what sort? "
1575,"JO: Well, will those signs help you find out? "
1576,DOCTOR: They will if I can translate them. 
1577,(The Brigadier and Yates enter in combat gear.) 
1578,"DOCTOR: My word, you look very fierce. "
1579,BRIGADIER: We've located that coach load of Nestene Autons distributing
1580,"those daffodils, Doctor. "
1581,DOCTOR: Good. 
1582,BRIGADIER: They're hiding in that same quarry where they took you. 
1583,"DOCTOR: Well, that's curious. Was the Master with them? "
1584,BRIGADIER: I couldn't say. You might be able to identify him
1585,afterwards. 
1586,DOCTOR: Afterwards? 
1587,BRIGADIER: I've got the RAF to lay on a rocket strike. In a few hours
1588,"time, that coach should be a pile of scrap iron. "
1589,DOCTOR: The military mind at its most scintillating. Faced with a
1590,problem they blast it off the face of the earth. 
1591,JO: What do you think we should do? 
1592,DOCTOR: Nothing. Keep them under observation for a while and give me a
1593,chance to find out the purpose of these flowers. 
1594,"BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, Doctor. I can't afford to take that risk. If that"
1595,"coach moves to a populated area, it'll be impossible to destroy it. The"
1596,strike will go ahead as planned. 
1597,DOCTOR: Captain Yates? 
1598,(The Brigadier leaves.) 
1599,"YATES: Yes, Doctor? "
1600,DOCTOR: How long have we got? 
1601,YATES: About an hour and a half. The RAF boys are setting things up now
1602,and we have established an observation point at the quarry. 
1603,"JO: Mike, can we reach you there? "
1604,YATES: Sure. We'll be in radio contact with HQ and with the RAF. You
1605,can get us on one of these. 
1606,(Yates gives a radio to Jo.) 
1607,"YATES: See you, Doc. Bye, Jo. "
1608,(Yates leaves.) 
1609,DOCTOR: An hour and a half.

1612, FARREL: Everything seems quiet. 
1613,AUTON: The humans are watching us. 
1614,FARREL: How do you know? 
1615,AUTON: We were followed to this place.
1616,
1617, [UNIT Laboratory]
1618,
1619, JO: But won't that programme pattern be a Nestene?
1620,
1621,"DOCTOR: Yes, well done. That's why I'm converting it to visual symbols."
1622,"Ah, here it comes. "
1623,JO: That's a face. A part of one. 
1624,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, a nose and a mouth. "
1625,JO: What does that mean? 
1626,DOCTOR: I've no idea. 
1627,JO: So what next? 
1628,"DOCTOR: Well, if it is a weapon, we must find out what triggers it off."
1629,"Jo, get in touch with the Brigadier, will you? See if he can hold up"
1630,that air strike. I must have more time. 
1631,(Jo uses the radio.) 
1632,"JO: Hello, Greyhound. This is Trap One. Do you read me? Over. (static)"
1633,"There seems to be something wrong. Hello, Greyhound. This is Trap One."
1634,Do you read me? Over. 
1635,(The daffodil turns towards them.) 
1636,"DOCTOR: Jo, look! "
1637,JO: It's alive! 
1638,DOCTOR: Short wave radio. You must have triggered it off with that
1639,walkie-talkie. Of course. They must be planning to set them all off at
1640,once with a gigantic radio signal. If I could only find out the
1641,direction of the signal. 
1642,JO: It seems to be looking for something. 
1643,"DOCTOR: Jo, be careful. Jo! "
1644,"(The daffodil sprays out a liquid at Jo's face. It hardens instantly,"
1645,blocking Jo's nose and mouth. The Doctor has to use an aerosol to get
1646,it off her skin.) 
1647,DOCTOR: It's all over. You all right? 
1648,JO: Just a bit short of breath. What happened? 
1649,"DOCTOR: Well, your nose and mouth were sealed off with this. "
1650,JO: What's that? 
1651,"DOCTOR: Plastic film. You would have been unconscious in two minutes,"
1652,dead in under ten. 
1653,JO: So all those people were killed by the daffodils? 
1654,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, they must have triggered them off accidentally, just"
1655,"as you did. Jo, do something for me, will you? "
1656,"JO: Yes, of course. "
1657,DOCTOR: Get in touch with that idiot Brownrose. See if plastic
1658,"daffodils were found at the scenes of any of those deaths. Oh, and ask"
1659,"him if anybody was using short wave radios, will you? "
1660,JO: Okay. 
1661,DOCTOR: You all right? 
1662,"JO: Fine, Doctor. And thank you."

1669,BRIGADIER: Right. 
1670,"YATES: No word from the Doctor then, sir? "
1671,BRIGADIER: No. The air strike's due to begin in thirty seven minutes.
1672,"If the Doctor's coming up with anything, he'd better be quick."
1673,
1674, [UNIT Laboratory]
1675,
1676, DOCTOR: Now why wasn't this stuff found on the
1677,bodies? 
1678,"(The Doctor sniffs the plastic film, then breathes hard on it. It"
1679,shrivels in his hand.) 
1680,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Dissolved by carbon dioxide from the lungs. "
1681,"MASTER: Good afternoon, Doctor. "
1682,"(The Master comes down the spiral staircase, holding his cylinder"
1683,weapon ready.) 
1684,MASTER: I hope I'm not interrupting anything important. 
1685,"DOCTOR: No, no, indeed not. You've come here to kill me, of course. "
1686,MASTER: But not without considerable regret. 
1687,DOCTOR: How very comforting. 
1688,"MASTER: You see, Doctor, you're my intellectual equal. Almost. I have"
1689,"so few worth opponents. When they've gone, I always miss them. "
1690,DOCTOR: How did you get in here? 
1691,"MASTER: Oh, don't be trivial, Doctor. I see you've been working on the"
1692,Nestene autojet. My own small contribution to their invasion plan. 
1693,"DOCTOR: Vicious, complicated and inefficient. Typical of your way of"
1694,thinking. 
1695,"MASTER: Now, come, come, Doctor. Death is always more frightening when"
1696,it strikes invisibly. 
1697,"DOCTOR: Tell me, how do you intend to activate these flowers? "
1698,"MASTER: Oh, by a radio impulse which the Nestenes will send. I shall"
1699,open the channel for them. We've distributed four hundred and fifty
1700,"thousand of these daffodils, so when four hundred and fifty thousand"
1701,"people fall dead, the country will be disrupted. "
1702,DOCTOR: And in the confusion the Nestenes will land their invasion
1703,force. 
1704,MASTER: Exactly. It's a shame that you can't be here to enjoy the chaos
1705,"and destruction with me. Goodbye, Doctor. "
1706,(Jo walks in just as the Master was about to shoot the Doctor. As the
1707,"Master is distracted, the Doctor grabs something from the bench.) "
1708,JO: You were quite right 
1709,DOCTOR: Wait! Don't shoot. 
1710,"MASTER: Doctor, you do disappoint me. We Time Lords are expected to"
1711,face death with dignity. 
1712,"JO: Oh, no! "
1713,DOCTOR: Don't worry. He's not going to kill me. 
1714,MASTER: That is your last mistake. 
1715,"DOCTOR: If you fire that thing, you will never be able to leave this"
1716,planet. 
1717,"MASTER: You're bluffing on an empty hand, Doctor. "
1718,"DOCTOR: I'm not bluffing and my hand, as you can see, is not empty. If"
1719,"you kill me, you will destroy the dematerialisation circuit from your"
1720,"own Tardis. You recognise it, I feel sure. "
1721,MASTER: Where did you get that? 
1722,DOCTOR: The circus. 
1723,"MASTER: You underestimate me, Doctor. Let me be quite plain. Either you"
1724,"hand that unit over to me now, or I kill Miss Grant. "
1725,DOCTOR: Touch�. 
1726,JO: Don't! He's beaten already! They're going to bomb the quarry. 
1727,DOCTOR: Jo! 
1728,"MASTER: Oh. There's been a slight change of plan, Doctor. I've decided"
1729,"to let you live, for a little while."

1776,(The Master takes the dematerialisation circuit.) 
1777,"MASTER: Thank you. Right, you come with me. "
1778,(An energy sphere is pulsing in a cardboard box.) 
1779,"MASTER: Now, because of the change in circumstances, we're going to"

1784,DOCTOR: We're just three or four miles from that radio telescope.
