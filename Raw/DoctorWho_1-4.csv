19, Episode One - The Roof
20,Of The World  
21, [Snowfield] 
22,(There's a large footprint in the snow)
23,SUSAN: Must've been made by a giant. What do you make of this?
24,"IAN: Well, it could be a perfectly ordinary footprint, Susan, and the"
25,sun's melted the edges and made it look a bit bigger.
26,SUSAN: Oh.
27,(The Doctor comes out of the Tardis)
28,"IAN: You all right, Doctor?"
29,"DOCTOR: Yes. Oh, a little bit out of breath. Oh, that's quite"
30,"understandable. After all, we're several thousand feet above sea level."
31,"SUSAN: Do you know where we are then, Grandfather?"
32,"DOCTOR: Well, I directed the ship towards Earth and it looks as though"
33,I've been successful.
34,SUSAN: But what about that? (the footprint) 
35,"DOCTOR: That? Oh, I can't see anything without my glasses. Anyway, I"
36,don't like this place. You'll have to excuse me. I've got a lot of work
37,to do first. 
38,(The Doctor goes back into the Tardis.)
39,"IAN: Barbara, I wonder, do you think it could be the Earth? If it were,"
40,where do you think we could be? In the Alps?
41,BARBARA: Or it could be the Andes. 
42,"SUSAN: Himalayas, the roof of the world."
43,"IAN: The roof of the world. I wonder. If only. Well, the Doctor isn't"
44,"very reliable, you know. Mustn't count on"
45,anything.
46,(The Doctor comes out of the Tardis again.)
47,"DOCTOR: Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear. We're always in trouble, Isn't this"
48,extraordinary? It follows us everywhere.
49,IAN: What's the matter?
50,DOCTOR: All the lights in the ship have gone out. The whole circuit has
51,"burned itself to a cinder, and added to that it affected the water. We"
52,haven't got any.
53,"IAN: Well, the water's no bother, Doctor. I mean, we've got snow,"
54,plenty of it. But how about the heating?
55,"DOCTOR: Oh, the heating as well. Everything's gone to pot."
56,BARBARA: But that's serious. We could freeze to death.
57,DOCTOR: Serious. Are you telling? There's no need for you to tell me
58,"that, really."
59,IAN: I think I'd better try and find some fuel.
60,"DOCTOR: Fuel? Now where on earth do you expect to find fuel here, hmm?"
61,"IAN: Well, I must try, mustn't I?"
62,"DOCTOR: Oh well, I wish you luck."
63,"BARBARA: I'll come with you, Ian."
64,IAN: Thank you.
65,"SUSAN: Yes, me too."
66,"IAN: No, Susan, you stay here."
67,"DOCTOR: You stay with me, child. You might be able to help me."
68,SUSAN: Okay.
69,"IAN: Oh, come on, Barbara, we haven't much time."
70,"DOCTOR: Now, Susan, go into the ship and fetch me the two L oh, will"
71,"you? You know what it is. Even if I do find the fault, I don't suppose"
72,"I shall be able to repair it before it gets dark, and then we shall all"
73,freeze to death.
74,
75,[Mountainside]
76,
77,"BARBARA: Ian, wait a minute. I must rest."
78,"IAN: Come on, Barbara. We haven't found anything yet. We must find"
79,something.
80,"BARBARA: All right then, you go on. I'll catch up with you. "
81,IAN: All right.
82,"BARBARA: Oh, it's hopeless. "
83,"(Ian goes on. Barbara closes her eyes, reopens them and sees something"
84,furry
85,near her.)
86,BARBARA: Ian! 
87,IAN: What is it? What's the matter?
88,"BARBARA: I, there was there was an animal or something! Just standing"
89,"there staring at me. You don't believe me, do you? Well, look at these"
90,footprints.
91,IAN: I'd better take you back to the ship.
92,
93,[Snowfield]
94,
95,(The Doctor and Susan are looking at a broken
96,component.)
97,"SUSAN: Can you mend it, Grandfather, or have you got to make a new one?"
98,"DOCTOR: I'm afraid it's going to need a new one, dear. It's going to"
99,"take me days. Oh well, I don't know, really, I always seem to "
100,(Ian and Barbara enter.)
101,"DOCTOR: Well, Chesterton?"
102,"IAN: Just as you predicted, Doctor, nothing but snow and ice."
103,DOCTOR: Yes.
104,BARBARA: Have you found the fault?
105,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, but it's going to take such a long time. Time we"
106,don't have. Now the only chance is to try and get down to a lower
107,"altitude and, you know, before it gets cold and we "
108,"BARBARA: Doctor, there are strange things on the mountain. I saw one of"
109,them.
110,DOCTOR: What's she talking about now?
111,"IAN: Well, I only saw a print."
112,"DOCTOR: Print? What sort of print? Paws, hooves, what?"
113,"IAN: To tell you the truth, I thought it was made by a fur boot."
114,"BARBARA: No, Ian, I'm sure it wasn't human."
115,"DOCTOR: And if it were, that means there's shelter nearby."
116,(Susan sees the figure again.)
117,SUSAN: Look!
118,"BARBARA: Look, there it is."
119,"IAN: Quick, after it. It's our only chance of shelter."
120,"SUSAN: Come on, Grandfather."
121,"DOCTOR: All right. Yes, yes, yes, yes."
122,
123,[Mountainside]
124,
125,IAN: Which way did it go?
126,"(Suddenly, they are surrounded by Mongols.)"
127,SUSAN: Grandfather!
128,"IAN: Keep still. We're travellers, lost on the mountains. Will you give"
129,us shelter?
130,"TEGANA: Hear me, Mongols. In these parts live evil spirits, who take"
131,our likeness to deceive us and then lead us to our deaths. Let us
132,therefore destroy these evil spirits before they destroy us.
133,IAN: We're not evil spirits. We are people like yourselves.
134,TEGANA: Destroy them.
135,POLO: Stop! Put up your swords.
136,TEGANA: Would you have us killed? These are evil spirits. 
137,POLO: I command you in the name of Kublai Khan. 
138,(The Mongols put their weapons away.)
139,POLO: The old man has the mountain sickness?
140,"IAN: Yes, he has."
141,POLO: My caravan is further down the pass. Come.
142,"IAN: Come on, Doctor."
143,"SUSAN: Who is he, Barbara?"
144,BARBARA: I was asking myself the same question.
145,
146,[Tent]
147,
148,"POLO: We have guests, Ping-Cho. They are cold and"
149,hungry.
150,"PING-CHO: (a young girl) Yes, Messer Marco."
151,"IAN: Sit down, Doctor."
152,(Ping-Cho gives the Doctor a bowl of soup.)
153,"DOCTOR: Thank you, my dear."
154,"SUSAN: He's not like her, or any of the others."
155,"BARBARA: No, he's a European, Susan, and he mentioned Kublai Khan. "
156,SUSAN: Kublai Khan?
157,"BARBARA: He was a great Mongol leader, who conquered all of Asia. He"
158,had a European in his service. He was a Venetian and his name 
159,"POLO: I'm afraid the liquid is not too warm, but the cold here is so"
160,"intense, it even robs a flame of its heat."
161,"DOCTOR: Oh, it's excellent nourishment, sir."
162,"IAN: The cold can't affect the heat of the flame, sir. The liquid boils"
163,"at a lower temperature, because there's so little air up here."
164,POLO: You mean the air is responsible?
165,"IAN: Well, the lack of it. Just as the lack of it is responsible for"
166,the Doctor's mountain sickness.
167,BARBARA: Is your name Marco Polo?
168,"POLO: It is, my lady, and may I ask who you are?"
169,"DOCTOR: Oh we're travellers yes. That's my grandchild, Susan, and"
170,"that's Miss Wright, and that's Charlton."
171,IAN: Chesterton. Ian Chesterton. 
172,POLO: My companions are the Lady Ping-Cho and the Warlord Tegana. We
173,travel to Shang Tu.
174,"BARBARA: Shang Tu? That's in China, isn't it?"
175,POLO: China? I do not know this place. Shang Tu is in Cathay.
176,"BARBARA: Oh, silly of me. Yes, of course, Cathay."
177,"POLO: Well, you must all be very tired. Ping-Cho, you will share your"
178,quarters with?
179,SUSAN: Susan.
180,"POLO: Susan. I will sleep here with the others, and Lady?"
181,BARBARA: Miss Wright.
182,"POLO: Miss Wright, you will have mine."
183,BARBARA: Thank you.
184,DOCTOR: Thank you. You saved our lives.
185,POLO: I'm rather curious to know why you were wandering around the
186,"mountainside at night, but questions can wait until morning."
187,"DOCTOR: Oh, there were two, young man, that I would like to ask."
188,"POLO: Well, ask them."
189,"DOCTOR: What year is this and where are we, hmm?"
190,POLO: You do not know?
191,DOCTOR: That is why I'm asking you.
192,POLO: How long have you been travelling? It is twelve hundred and
193,"eighty nine and this is the Plain of Pamir, known to those who travel"
194,to Cathay as The Roof of the World.
195,IAN: The Roof of the World?
196,DOCTOR: Twelve hundred and eighty nine. Ah..
197,
198,[The girl's compartment]
199,
200,(The girls can't sleep)
201,"PING-CHO: Are you asleep, Susan?"
202,SUSAN: No.
203,PING-CHO: Where are you from?
204,"SUSAN: That's a very difficult question to answer, Ping-Cho."
205,PING-CHO: You do not know where your home is?
206,"SUSAN: Well, I've had many homes in many places. What about you?"
207,PING-CHO: I come from Samarkand. My father is government official there.
208,SUSAN: But I thought Mister Polo said that 
209,PING-CHO: Messer Marco! That's what we call him in Cathay. 
210,"SUSAN: Well, I thought Messer Marco said that you were going to Shang"
211,Tu. Are you on holiday?
212,"PING-CHO: No, Kublai Khan's summer palace is in Shang Tu. I am going"
213,there to be married.
214,SUSAN: What? But how old are you?
215,PING-CHO: I am in my sixteenth year.
216,"SUSAN: Well, so am I."
217,PING-CHO: Do you marry at our age in your land? Here it is the custom.
218,SUSAN: Is your fiancï¿½ handsome?
219,PING-CHO: My what?
220,"SUSAN: Your, the man you're going to marry."
221,PING-CHO: I have never seen him.
222,SUSAN: What?
223,PING-CHO: The marriage has been arranged by my family. I know only two
224,things about him.
225,SUSAN: What are they?
226,PING-CHO: He is very important man. 
227,SUSAN: That's a good start.
228,PING-CHO: And he's seventy-five years old.
229,
230,[Tent]
231,
232,TEGANA: You should have let me kill them.
233,POLO: Why? Because their clothes are different from ours? Because their
234,"words are unfamiliar to our ears? No, Tegana, they are travellers."
235,"TEGANA: They are evil spirits. Sorcerers. Magicians. Tomorrow, if we"
236,"live until then, you may see that I speak the truth."
237,"POLO: I think the sun's rays will dispel the shadows from your mind,"
238,Tegana.
239,"TEGANA: Is that what you believe. Listen, the carriage they travel in"
240,has no wheels. It just stands there like a warlord's tomb on one end.
241,And another thing. It is not large enough to carry four people.
242,POLO: It must be.
243,"TEGANA: I say it is not, and yet I saw all four walk from it. Upon my"
244,"sword, I swear it to you."
245,
246,[Outside the Tardis]
247,
248,(Day)
249,"POLO: So, this is your caravan?"
250,"IAN: Yes, the Doctor calls it the Tardis."
251,POLO: Where are the wheels?
252,IAN: It doesn't have any.
253,POLO: Then how does it move?
254,IAN: Through the air.
255,TEGANA: Did I not say they that they were evil spirits?
256,POLO: Are you of the Buddhist faith?
257,"IAN: No, why?"
258,"POLO: Well, at the Khan's court in Peking, I have seen Buddhist monks"
259,make cups of wine fly through the air unaided and offer themselves to
260,"the Great Khan's lips. I do not understand it, but I have seen it."
261,"There is room for all of you inside here, Miss Wright?"
262,BARBARA: Yes.
263,POLO: And one enters here?
264,BARBARA: It's locked.
265,POLO: Where is the key?
266,"BARBARA: The Doctor has it, and you wouldn't let him come up here."
267,"POLO: Oh yes, he has the mountain sickness. Have you the power to make"
268,it fly?
269,"IAN: No, only the Doctor has that power."
270,POLO: Why is it here?
271,SUSAN: It's damaged.
272,POLO: What?
273,IAN: Part of it is broken.
274,POLO: But it could be moved by hand?
275,"IAN: Oh yes, if you had sufficient men."
276,"POLO: Well, we'll make a sledge and take it down the pass. Then we"
277,shall see.
278,
279,[Tent]
280,
281,"(Ping-Cho is cooking, when the Doctor"
282,enters.)Â 
283,"DOCTOR: Ping-Cho, this smells very, very good! What is it?"
284,"PING-CHO: Bean-sprout soup, my lord."
285,"DOCTOR: Allow me. (he tastes it) Oh, it's delicious, delicious."
286,PING-CHO: My lord is kind.
287,"DOCTOR: You know, it's rather surprising to find the daughter of a high"
288,government official working as a servant in Marco Polo's caravan.
289,"PING-CHO: I wish to serve, my lord, although, among Messer Marco's"
290,"retinue, there is a man who calls himself a cook."
291,"DOCTOR: His name wouldn't be Tegana, would it?"
292,"PING-CHO: Oh no, my lord. The Warlord Tegana is a special emissary from"
293,"the camp of the great Mongol Lord Khan Noghai, who has been at war with"
294,Kublai Khan.
295,"DOCTOR: Yes, Mongol fighting Mongol. "
296,"PING-CHO: The war is over, my lord. Noghai has sued for peace and"
297,Tegana travels to Kublai's court to discuss the armistice plans. 
298,"DOCTOR: Yes, oh well, yes. Well, for an emissary of peace, he has"
299,"rather blood-thirsty habits, doesn't he?"
300,"(Marco Polo, Ian, Barbara and Susan enter.)"
301,"POLO: I find your caravan most unusual, Doctor."
302,"DOCTOR: Yes, Messer Marco, it is different."
303,POLO: And in need of repair?
304,DOCTOR: That is true.
305,SUSAN: Messer Marco has ordered a sledge to be made. He's going to
306,bring the Tardis down here.
307,DOCTOR: Oh indeed? That's charming of you. Very charming of you. It
308,won't take me very long to repair. A day or two. But I assure you that
309,I shall not hold up your journey any longer than is necessary.
310,POLO: I'm afraid we can't stay here. One crosses the Plain of Pamir as
311,"quickly as possible. However, we will be spending a few days at Lop."
312,BARBARA: Lop? Where's that?
313,"POLO: It's a town on the edge of the Gobi Desert, beyond Kashgar and"
314,Yarkand.
315,"DOCTOR: I see, and you will be taking us along with you, including the"
316,Tardis?
317,"POLO: Doctor, I once transported an entire army and its equipment from"
318,"Cathay to India, all without loss."
319,"DOCTOR: Oh good, good. Then I can work as we proceed."
320,POLO: No.
321,"DOCTOR: Why not, hmm?"
322,POLO: The Mongol bearers still half believe that you are evil spirits.
323,"They also believe that outside your caravan, you are harmless. However,"
324,"should any of you attempt to enter, there would be trouble."
325,"DOCTOR: I see. You saved our lives, Messer Marco and the least we can"
326,do is to respect your wishes. No one will enter the Tardis until we
327,reach Lop.
328,POLO: Good.
329,
330,POLO : Success. My plan has worked. The
331,strangers and their unusual caravan accompany me to Lop. Our route
332,"takes us across the Roof of the World, down to the Kashgar Valley and"
333,"southeast to Tarkand. Here we join the Old Silk Road, along which the"
334,commerce and culture of a thousand years has travelled to and from
335,Cathay. I wonder what the strangers' reaction will be when I tell them
336,what I propose to do?
337,
338,[Lodgings]
339,
340,"POLO: My caravan is large, Yeng, so I shall need"
341,plenty of food and water before venturing out into the Gobi Desert. 
342,(Yeng leaves. Susan and Ping-Cho come down the stairs) 
343,"POLO: Is the accommodation to your liking, Ping-Cho?"
344,"PING-CHO: Thank you, Messer Marco. It is most comfortable."
345,"SUSAN: Oh, I think it's fab."
346,"PING-CHO: Fab? What is that, Susan?"
347,"SUSAN: Well, it's, it means wonderful! It's a verb we often use on"
348,Earth.
349,"DOCTOR: Oh, Messer Marco, these way-stations, do you have many of these"
350,in Cathay?
351,"POLO: Yes, the Khan has them dotted at regular intervals throughout his"
352,domain. Those who work in his service and wear the Khan's gold seal
353,"have the right to demand anything they may require. Provisions, horses,"
354,shelter.
355,"SUSAN: May I have a look, please?"
356,POLO: Of course.
357,SUSAN: Thank you.
358,IAN: Doctor.
359,DOCTOR: Yes?
360,IAN: They've set the Tardis up in the courtyard.
361,"DOCTOR: Oh, excellent, excellent. If you'll pardon me, I have a lot of"
362,work to do and 
363,"(The Doctor tries to get into the Tardis, but is stopped by Mongol"
364,soldiers. He goes back inside) 
365,DOCTOR: What does this mean?
366,"POLO: Please sit down, Doctor."
367,DOCTOR: I don't wish to sit down. I want you to call your guards off.
368,POLO: Please be seated.
369,DOCTOR: No.
370,POLO: I beg you to hear me out.
371,DOCTOR: But I have work to do.
372,"BARBARA: I think, perhaps, we should listen to him. Come on."
373,"DOCTOR: Oh, very well. "
374,POLO: My home is Venice. I left there with my father and my uncle to
375,come to Cathay in twelve seventy one. The journey to Peking took us
376,"three and a half years. When I arrived at the Khan's court, I was"
377,"twenty one. I was an alert young man, good at languages, and willing to"
378,learn. The Khan liked me.
379,"DOCTOR: Oh, really?"
380,"POLO: On my twenty fifth birthday, I was given an appointment in the"
381,Khan's service.
382,BARBARA: Twelve seventy seven.
383,"POLO: It was, as you say, twelve seventy seven. Since then, I have"
384,"travelled to every corner of his domain and beyond it. Two years ago,"
385,"my father, my uncle and I asked the Khan for permission to go home. He"
386,refused. I think we had all served him too well.
387,"DOCTOR: Well, I really don't see what this has to do with my repairing"
388,the Tardis. 
389,"POLO: Doctor, I have not seen my home for eighteen years. I want to go"
390,back.
391,"DOCTOR: Well, ask the Khan again."
392,"POLO: I intend to. This time, I shall offer him a gift so magnificent"
393,that he will not be able to refuse me.
394,IAN: You mean to give the Doctor's caravan to him?
395,POLO: Yes.
396,DOCTOR: You're mad.
397,POLO: You can make another.
398,"DOCTOR: What? In Peking, or Shang Tu?"
399,"POLO: You do me an injustice, Doctor. I will not leave you stranded in"
400,"Cathay, just as I did not let you die on the mountain. No, you will"
401,come with me to Venice and make another one there.
402,"DOCTOR: Oh, you think so, really? Oh no. Oh no."
403,"IAN: Marco, it's impossible."
404,"POLO: Surely, for a man who possesses a flying caravan, all things are"
405,possible?
406,"IAN: No. We need special metals, materials, things that don't exist in"
407,Venice. I'm afraid you don't understand all the problems involved.
408,"DOCTOR: And neither do you, young man. "
409,"POLO: Well, travel home by ship. We trade with every port in the world."
410,"It may take you longer, but you'll get there eventually. "
411,DOCTOR: Eventually. He doesn't know what he's talking about. The man's
412,a lunatic. Ho. 
413,"POLO: No, Doctor, desperate. There are many men who are jealous of the"
414,"Polo influence at court, and the Khan suffers from an affliction for"
415,which there is no cure.
416,BARBARA: What's that?
417,"POLO: Old age. If he dies, I may never see Venice again."
418,"DOCTOR: Well, that is your problem, not mine. "
419,"POLO: I have just made it yours, Doctor. "
420,"BARBARA: But you do see Venice again, Marco, I know you do. "
421,IAN: What makes you so sure that the Doctor's caravan is a suitable
422,present? The Doctor is the only one who can fly it. 
423,POLO: I told you about the Buddhist monks. They will discover its
424,secret. A caravan that flies. Do you imagine what this will mean to the
425,Khan? It will make him the most powerful ruler the world has ever
426,known. Stronger than Hannibal. Mightier than Alexander the Great. 
427,"IAN: Marco, you don't understand. "
428,POLO: I refuse to listen you to any more. My mind is made up. Your
429,caravan goes with me to Kublai Khan. 
430,"BARBARA: Doctor, come on. Come and sit down."
431,"DOCTOR: Oh well, what a mess."
432,SUSAN: Grandfather. Grandfather.
433,"DOCTOR: Yes. Go by sea, he says. "
434,SUSAN: Why are you laughing? He means it. 
435,"BARBARA: Doctor, he's serious. "
436,DOCTOR: I know he is. Yes. 
437,SUSAN: What are you going to do?
438,DOCTOR: (in total hysterics) I haven't the faintest idea.
439,
440,[Alleyway]
441,
442,"MAN: Be careful, my lord. One drop will poison an"
443,army. 
444,"TEGANA: I will use it well, on all but the first of Marco Polo's water"
445,"gourds, for tomorrow, the caravan sets out to cross the Gobi Desert."
446,"Now, you will follow us, and on the third night I will walk back to"
447,"you. Then we will ride back here to Lop, wait for two days, and then"
448,"return to the caravan to collect the thing of magic, and bring the"
449,mighty Kublai Khan to his knees!
450,
451,Episode Two - The
452,Singing Sands
453,
454,POLO : I have taken charge of the travellers'
455,"unusual caravan, and set out into the Gobi Desert. The journey across"
456,"this vast ocean of sand is slow and hazardous. To make matters worse,"
457,the old Doctor continually shows his disapproval of my action by being
458,"both difficult and bad-tempered. For three days now, during which time"
459,"we have covered no more than thirty miles, I have had to endure his"
460,insults.

464,(night) 
465,IAN: How much water does a caravan like this use crossing the Gobi
466,"Desert, Marco? "
467,"POLO: We will use one barrel every five days, Ian. I have allowed for"
468,eight gourds to carry us across to the other side. 
469,TEGANA: The bones of many men who thought they had enough lie bleached
470,in the desert sand. 
471,"POLO: I think we should exercise some restraint, Tegana. I'm sorry the"
472,Doctor wouldn't eat with us this evening. 
473,"SUSAN: Yes, so am I, Messer Marco. I've given him food. "
474,(Susan goes behind a partition) 
475,"POLO: A game of chess, Ian? "
476,"IAN: Oh, well, I'm not very good, but I'll give you a game. "
477,POLO: I gladly accept your challenge. 
478,BARBARA: What magnificent pieces. 
479,"POLO: Yes, I purchased them in Hamutz, on my first journey to Cathay."
480,"Now, they go with me everywhere. "
481,TEGANA: Do you 
482,"SUSAN: I'm sorry, Marco. "
483,(Susan runs out of the tent) 
484,"TEGANA: Do you play chess, lady? "
485,"BARBARA: Not very well, Tegana. Excuse me. "
486,(Barbara leaves) 
487,TEGANA: I find it a fascinating game of strategy of war. Two equally
488,"balanced armies deployed upon a field of battle, and each commander"
489,determined to be the one who cries shah mat. 
490,IAN: Shah mat? Check mate? 
491,TEGANA: It means the king is dead.

493,[Outside the tent]
494,
495,"BARBARA: We'll get the Tardis back, Susan. "
496,"SUSAN: Yes, at Kublai Khan's court when it's too late. We should be up"
497,"there. Another time, another galaxy. "
498,BARBARA: We'll think of something. 
499,SUSAN: How? Ian's playing chess with Marco. Grandfather's being rude
500,and sulking by himself. 
501,"BARBARA: Oh, I don't think he's sulking, is he? "
502,"SUSAN: Well, he won't eat. He won't even talk to me. "
503,"BARBARA: Well, you know him better than I do, but I'd have said he was"
504,"just feeling defenceless. He has a wonderful machine, capable of all"
505,"sorts of miracles, and it's taken away from him by a man he calls a"
506,"primitive. Look, Tardis is the only home we have at the moment. When"
507,we're in it we feel safe and secure. When we're out of it. 
508,SUSAN: Will he talk to me? Confide in me? 
509,"BARBARA: Oh, he's like a rubber ball. He'll come bouncing out of there"
510,soon full of ideas. 
511,"SUSAN: One day we'll know all the mysteries of the skies, and we'll"
512,stop our wandering. 
513,BARBARA: Then you and I will say goodbye. 
514,"SUSAN: Oh, not yet. Not for a long time. "
515,"BARBARA: Well, I think we should say goodnight anyway. "
516,SUSAN: Are you coming? 
517,"BARBARA: No, not for the moment. "
518,SUSAN: Goodnight.

524,"SUSAN: Oh, well, I'll go too then. Goodnight. "
525,"POLO: Goodnight, Susan. Sleep well. Now, what was I about to do? Ah"
526,yes. 
527,IAN: Ouch.

530,
531,SUSAN: Not asleep yet? 
532,"PING-CHO: No, I was thinking. "
533,SUSAN: What about? 
534,PING-CHO: How peaceful it is in the desert. 
535,"SUSAN: Oh, it's a lovely night. "
536,PING-CHO: The moon will rise later. That is the time to see the desert.
537,It is like a great silver sea. 
538,SUSAN: The metal seas of Venus. 
539,PING-CHO: Where? 
540,"SUSAN: Oh, a long way from here. I've never seen a moonlit night. How"
541,long before the moon rises? 
542,PING-CHO: Two or three hours. I'll call you then.
543,

545,
546,BARBARA: Night in the desert is very beautiful. 
547,"POLO: Don't be deceived by it, Miss Wright, the desert is always"
548,dangerous. 
549,IAN: Like my Queen. Check. 
550,"TEGANA: Marco, can you save your King? "
551,"POLO: I think so, Tegana. Check."

558,PING-CHO: Shh. The guard'll hear you. Crazy? 
559,"SUSAN: We like dig it. You know, like it. "
560,PING-CHO: This language of yours is very strange. 
561,(Tegana comes out of the main tent and talks to a guard) 
562,SUSAN: Tegana. Let's follow him. 
563,PING-CHO: He'll be angry. 
564,SUSAN: You're not afraid? 
565,PING-CHO: No. I am not. Come. 
566,[Tent]
567,
568,(The two men are woken by the sound of neighing)

570,POLO: The horses are very restless. 
571,[Outside the tent]
572,
573,"POLO: There's a sandstorm coming, Ian. "
574,IAN: How do you know? 
575,POLO: Notice how still it is. As if everything were waiting. They sense
576,it too. 
577,IAN: Will it be a bad one? 
578,POLO: Bad enough. I must attend to the horses.
579,
580,[Desert]
581,
582,(Susan and Ping-Cho are trying to follow Tegana) 
583,SUSAN: He walks so quickly. Can you still see him? 
584,"PING-CHO: Yes. There he is, over there. "
585,"SUSAN: Oh, let's give up. "
586,PING-CHO: Who is afraid now? 
587,"SUSAN: No, I'm not afraid. It's just that it's so hot I can hardly"
588,breathe. 
589,PING-CHO: Yet it was most pleasant when we left the caravan. 
590,"SUSAN: Oh, come on, let's go back. "
591,PING-CHO: All right. Susan? Listen. 
592,SUSAN: What's that? 
593,PING-CHO: Where? 
594,SUSAN: That cloud on the horizon. 
595,"PING-CHO: Susan, it's a sandstorm! "
596,"SUSAN: What! It's coming this way! Ping-Cho, we must get back before it"
597,reaches us! 
598,"PING-CHO: No, the caravan's too far away! "
599,"SUSAN: No, come on! We must get back. We can't stay here! "
600,"PING-CHO: No, we'll get caught in it, and we'll never find our way! "
601,"SUSAN: Ping-Cho, come on! "
602,"PING-CHO: No, we must shelter here! "
603,SUSAN: No.

608,
609,"BARBARA: Ian, what is it? What's happened? "
610,"IAN: Don't be afraid, Barbara. It's a sandstorm. It sounds as if all"
611,the devils in hell were laughing. 
612,POLO: It's the wind shifting the sand. 
613,BARBARA: It's terrifying! 
614,"POLO: Not always, Barbara. Sometimes, it sounds like musical"
615,instruments being played. The clashing of drums and cymbals. I've heard
616,it sound like a great many people talking as they trekked across the
617,desert. It can also be like a familiar voice calling your name. You're
618,not the only one to be afraid. Travellers of the Gobi Desert have good
619,"reason to fear the singing sands, Barbara. "
620,IAN: It's fantastic that the doctor's still asleep. 
621,POLO: Tegana's not here. His bed's empty. 
622,IAN: What? 
623,POLO: Has anyone seen him? 
624,"IAN: Well, he can't be out in this. "
625,POLO: He must be. 
626,"BARBARA: Well, what will happen to him? "
627,"POLO: If he finds shelter, he'll be all right. "
628,"BARBARA: Well, can't we do anything? "
629,POLO: Nothing. 
630,BARBARA: I think I'll see if the girls are all right. Ping-Cho? 
631,POLO: Tegana's no fool. He can look after himself. Don't worry. 
632,BARBARA: They're gone. They're not there! 
633,IAN: Gone? 
634,"POLO: Barbara, you can't go out there! "
635,BARBARA: Let go! 
636,"POLO: Barbara, you'll be lost in seconds! "
637,"IAN: Calm down, Barbara! Marco's right. There's nothing we can do. "
638,BARBARA: The girls. 
639,POLO: We must wait until the storm calms down. There's nothing we can
640,do now. 
641,"BARBARA: Oh, it's all your fault anyway! If you hadn't kept us prisoner"
642,"here, none of this would have happened. Susan! Susan!"

655,POLO: Not until it's light. 
656,IAN: Let me go as soon as the storm is over.

660,"(Later, the sand storm has passed) "
661,BARBARA: We can't just go on sitting here. 
662,IAN: Shh. The Doctor's still asleep. We don't want him to know about
663,the girls. 
664,"POLO: Barbara, I give you my word that until we find the girls, we will"
665,not leave this place. 
666,"(Tegana, Ping-Cho and Susan enter) "
667,BARBARA: Susan! Do you know you had us half worried to death. Where
668,have you been? 
669,SUSAN: We went for a walk. 
670,BARBARA: A walk? 
671,"POLO: Without asking me? Don't you dare do that again, do you"
672,"understand? That also applies for you, Ping-Cho. "
673,"SUSAN: I'm sorry, Messer Marco. Has Grandfather been very worried? "
674,"IAN: Luckily for you, he's been asleep the whole time. "
675,POLO: And we don't want him to know anything about this. I'm surprised
676,"that you'd encourage such a venture, Tegana. "
677,"TEGANA: oh, they weren't with me. I found them, crouched behind a sand"
678,dune. 
679,POLO: You were alone? 
680,"TEGANA: Well, it was a pleasant night. I decided for a walk. I told the"
681,guard. He knew all about it. 
682,"POLO: In future, the guards will be told to notify me immediately if"
683,any of you wish to leave the camp. Now go and change. We have to break
684,camp soon. 
685,"SUSAN: Yes, Messer Marco. "
686,"(Tegana, Ping-Cho and Susan leave) "
687,"BARBARA: This has been a terrible experience for us all, Marco."
688,Couldn't we spend one more night here? 
689,"POLO: I'm sorry, Miss Wright. "
690,BARBARA: But surely one day can't make all that much difference? 
691,"POLO: One day without progress is one day's water wasted, And in the"
692,Gobi Desert that could mean the difference between life and death. 
693,"POLO : Progress today has been good, although"
694,we were all very tired after a sleepless night. How can I ever repay
695,Tegana for saving Ping-Cho and Susan? We covered fifteen miles before I
696,gave the order to set up camp for the night.

699,
700,PING-CHO: Susan? Susan. 
701,SUSAN: I still can't get this sand out of my hair. 
702,PING-CHO: Last night there were moments when I was sure I would never
703,be here again. 
704,"SUSAN: Ping-Cho, did you believe Tegana last night, when he told Messer"
705,Marco about going for a walk? 
706,PING-CHO: Why not? 
707,"SUSAN: Well, I don't think Tegana's the kind of man who goes for a walk"
708,just because it's a nice night. I think he goes because he has a reason
709,to go. 
710,"PING-CHO: Susan, why would he lie to Messer Marco? "
711,SUSAN: I don't know. 
712,PING-CHO: He's an important man. He's a special emissary of the great
713,Mongol leader who has been at war with Kublai Khan. Tegana is to
714,arrange a peaceful settlement between them. Would a man like that lie
715,about walking in the desert? 
716,"SUSAN: No, no, he wouldn't. That's what's so strange. "
717,PING-CHO: What? 
718,SUSAN: The fact that he did.

724,TEGANA: What is that you do? 
725,POLO: I keep a journal. 
726,TEGANA: Why? 
727,POLO: Because it interests me. 
728,TEGANA: Marco! 
729,"(Tegana comes at Polo with his sword, but Marco has his own weapon"
730,ready) 
731,"TEGANA: That's excellent, excellent. But it's better a man keeps the"
732,"blade of his sword clean, and it's edge sharp. You continue your"
733,"writing, Marco. I'll see to the horses tonight. I'll give the guard his"
734,instructions. 
735,"POLO: No, send him to me. Please. "

744,"POLO: Yes, except for the one we're using. "
745,IAN: How much is there left? 
746,"POLO: Without rationing, enough for today. "
747,"IAN: And with rationing, how long will it last? "
748,"POLO: Three, four days. "
749,BARBARA: Enough to get us back to Lop? 
750,"POLO: If we're very careful with it, yes. "
751,IAN: But who would have done it? 
752,"POLO: Bandits, Ian. "
753,BARBARA: Bandits? In the desert? 
754,"POLO: Yes, it has happened before, but not to me. The bandits follow a"
755,"caravan out into the desert. Then one night, this happens. The caravan"
756,is forced to turn back. Then when everyone is weak through lack of
757,"water, the bandits attack. "
758,"IAN: So if we turn back, we're bound to be attacked. "
759,POLO: Yes. 
760,TEGANA: Then we shall fight. 
761,IAN: There must be somewhere else we can go to. 
762,"POLO: The nearest is a small oasis, but that's one weeks journey north"
763,from here. 
764,"IAN: Marco, if we pressed really hard, walked day and night, how long"
765,would it take us? 
766,"POLO: Five, possibly six days. "
767,IAN: As long as that? 
768,"POLO: Yes, and with the water rationed we'll be growing weaker all the"
769,"time. There is another danger, Ian. Bandits always camp near an oasis. "
770,BARBARA: Then we must go back to Lop. 
771,"IAN: But they're bound to be waiting for us there. No, we must go"
772,"north, and take a chance. "
773,"POLO: Yes, what Ian says makes sense. We go to the oasis. "
774,TEGANA: We shall all die of thirst. I will not go. 
775,POLO: Then what will you do? 
776,TEGANA: Return to Lop. I'm not afraid of any bandits. Just give me my
777,share of the water. 
778,"POLO: No, Tegana. "
779,TEGANA: You refuse the War Lord Tegana? 
780,"POLO: I am Commander of this caravan, and I am responsible to Kublai"
781,Khan for your safety. We go north together.
782,
783,POLO : Have I made the right decision? Each
784,"day, our progress towards the oasis becomes less. On the first day, we"
785,"covered twenty miles. On the second, fifteen. The third, ten. The"
786,fourth day's total was eight. Now on the fifth day we have travelled
787,only two miles before the heat of the sun has forced us to stop. We are
788,"nearly exhausted, and our situation is perilous."

795,soon we've had this. 
796,IAN: The bearers have their ration? 
797,(The water runs out when Polo gets to Ian) 
798,POLO: No. 
799,IAN: You take it. 
800,POLO: We will share. 
801,"DOCTOR: Marco, is this all we're going to get until tonight, hmm? "
802,"POLO: Until we reach the oasis, Doctor, yes. "
803,BARBARA: There's no more? 
804,TEGANA: How much further? 
805,POLO: I cannot say. 
806,TEGANA: I will go to the oasis and bring back water. 
807,POLO: You think you could reach the oasis? 
808,TEGANA: Yes. My horse is still the strongest. 
809,"POLO: Very well, Tegana. "
810,TEGANA: You wait for me here. 
811,"POLO: No. No, while we can we'll push on towards the oasis. "

816,(The Doctor collapses) 
817,"SUSAN: Oh, Grandfather! What's the matter with him? "
818,IAN: He's exhausted. 
819,POLO: We'll fix up a cot for him in the wagon. 
820,"BARBARA: To be jostled and bumped about? He needs to rest in comfort,"
821,Marco. What about the Tardis? 
822,"IAN: He'd be more comfortable, Marco. "
823,"SUSAN: Please, Messer Marco. "
824,"POLO: Very well. The Doctor can travel in his own caravan. Susan, you"
825,"can go with him. But you, Barbara, and you, Ian, must remain with me. "
826,"IAN: Thank you. Marco, without water, the Doctor isn't going to last"

838,"Perhaps he never found the oasis. But in the hope he did, I inched our"

846,IAN: Nothing but sand. 
847,POLO: Tegana is our only hope now.

849,POLO: He would not start back from the oasis in the dark for fear of
850,missing us. 
851,PING-CHO: Then we must get going. 
852,POLO: Yes. 
853,"IAN: Hot again soon, Marco. Hadn't we better get started? "

881,"POLO: You told me you weren't carrying any, Doctor! "
882,"DOCTOR: I haven't got any water, don't you understand. I wouldn't allow"
883,"us to get into this state if I had water, young man. No, this was the"
884,water that was running off the walls. It's condensation. It's
885,"unbelievable. Condensation, do you understand? "
886,"POLO: No, I do not understand! "
887,"DOCTOR: Chesterton, make him understand. It was condensation off the"
888,walls and I 
889,POLO: The old man lied to me! 
890,"SUSAN: No, he did not lie. "
891,"IAN: Marco, you remember, last night it was cold. Bitterly cold, Marco."
892,"The outside of the caravan cooled, but the inside stayed warm, and so"
893,"moisture formed on the inside. It's condensation, we just call it that."
894,It's just a name. 
895,"SUSAN: That's true, Messer Marco. It was running down the walls, and"
896,"from the ceiling. We, we took it in this, look, we squeezed it in here."

910,"POLO: Had the Doctor not discovered water, you might have been too late"
911,"to save us, Tegana. "
912,BARBARA: And are those bandits likely to return? 
913,"TEGANA: No, I overheard them saying they were going to ride for"
914,Karakorum. 
915,"BARBARA: Karakorum? That used to be to the north, on the great Steppes."
916,
917,"POLO: It still is, Barbara. Well, the sooner we leave here the better. "
918,"BARBARA: But, Marco "
919,"POLO: This oasis is dangerous, Barbara. We must leave here as soon as"
920,possible. 
921,"BARBARA: Marco, we're all in need of rest, and the Doctor is still very"
922,weak. 
923,"POLO: We will stay here until tomorrow morning, no longer. Please tell"
924,the others. 
925,(She leaves Polo and Tegana alone) 
926,POLO: What amuses you? 
927,"TEGANA: You don't really believe their story, do you, of water forming"
928,inside a caravan? 
929,POLO: Yes. I know it to be true. 
930,"(meanwhile, elsewhere) "
931,"DOCTOR: I think I can repair the circuit in a week, maybe less. "
932,BARBARA: We're leaving here tomorrow. 
933,"DOCTOR: Oh, we're always rushing around. A good day's rest would do us"
934,all a lot of good. 
935,BARBARA: Marco's worried about bandits. 
936,"DOCTOR: Oh, rubbish. "
937,"BARBARA: Tegana said there were some here last night. Well, if they"
938,"were, they were very clean about it. "
939,IAN: What do you mean? 
940,"BARBARA: Look, last night was very cold, but there's no sign of a fire"
941,having been lit. 
942,IAN: Perhaps they didn't want anyone to know they'd been here. 
943,"BARBARA: Yes, that may be. But I think Tegana just used the bandits as"
944,an excuse for not coming back to us with water. 
945,"IAN: Maybe. Well, the thing to do is to ask Tegana. "
946,TEGANA: Ask Tegana what? 
947,IAN: How many bandits were there here last night? 
948,TEGANA: Twelve. 
949,IAN: It was a cold night. Didn't they light a fire? 
950,"POLO: If they had, Ian, the remains would still be visible. Doctor? "
951,DOCTOR: Well? 
952,"POLO: Barbara may have told you that we're leaving here tomorrow, so"
953,"get all the rest you can today. You may use your caravan again, but"
954,"before we leave in the morning, it will be locked and the key handed"
955,over to me. 
956,"DOCTOR: Young man, you have no concept of what is happening, have you?"
957,And you still don't seem to realise that you're speaking to a man of
958,superior intellect.
959,
960,POLO : My conscience pricks me. I was adamant
961,"despite the Doctor's protests, that the key and his caravan should be"
962,handed over to me. Now we journey on across this burning desert and I
963,shall not rest until I see the temple spires of the city of Tun-Huang.
964,

968,SUSAN: I've never seen so many temples in my life. 
969,"PING-CHO: Tun-Huang is a famous city, Susan. "
970,SUSAN: Yes. 
971,BARBARA: Isn't the cave of the Thousand Buddhas near here? 
972,SUSAN: Thousand Buddhas? 
973,POLO: Yes. Have you heard of the cave of the Five Hundred Eyes? 
974,"BARBARA: No, I haven't. "
975,"PING-CHO: I do not know that one either, Messer Marco. "
976,"BARBARA: I'm intrigued by this cave, Marco. Why is it called Five"
977,Hundred Eyes? 
978,POLO: On the walls are painted the faces of two hundred and fifty evil
979,men who once lived there. They were the Hashashins. 
980,SUSAN: Hashashins? 
981,"POLO: Yes, and they were so called because they used a drug, hashish. "
982,SUSAN: Are there still Hashashins in the cave? 
983,"POLO: No, Susan. They were put to the sword twenty years ago by a great"
984,Mongol conqueror called Hulagu. 
985,PING-CHO: There is a story of Hulagu and the Hashashins. 
986,"SUSAN: Oh, tell it to us, Ping-Cho. "
987,"PING-CHO: Later, if you wish. "
988,SUSAN: Why not now? 
989,PING-CHO: It needs preparation. 
990,SUSAN: Oh.

992,[Courtyard]
993,
994,DOCTOR: It seems we shall be stopping here for a
995,while. It means I can get on with more work. 
996,IAN: Huh? 
997,"DOCTOR: Repairing the circuit, young man. "
998,"IAN: Aren't you forgetting something, Doctor? "
999,DOCTOR: Don't you realise they will be much less vigilant? I shall be
1000,"able to sneak into the Tardis, no worry at all. "
1001,"IAN: Yes, but you've given Marco Polo the key. "
1002,"DOCTOR: A key, my boy. A key. What use do you think it's going to be to"
1003,"him, hmmm? And where do you suppose I got that from? "
1004,IAN: I have no idea. 
1005,DOCTOR: I made it. 
1006,IAN: Made it? When? 
1007,DOCTOR: On the night of the oasis. Only chance I had. She knows all
1008,"about it, don't you, Susan? "
1009,SUSAN: Yes. 
1010,IAN: You crafty old fox. 
1011,SUSAN: Grandfather? 
1012,DOCTOR: Yes? 
1013,SUSAN: What do you know about the Hashashin? 
1014,"DOCTOR: Well, now, let me think, let me think. Yes, they were some kind"
1015,of sect. Why? 
1016,"SUSAN: Well, Ping-Cho knows a story and she's going to tell us about"
1017,it. 
1018,"DOCTOR: Oh, how delightful. Yes, yes, why not? "
1019,[Tun-Huang Way Station]
1020,
1021,"BARBARA: Ian, Ian, I must talk to you. "
1022,IAN: What is it? 
1023,BARBARA: It's about Tegana. I caught him off-guard. 
1024,IAN: Shh. Later. Come and sit over here. 
1025,"BARBARA: No, I'll be all right over here. "
1026,"SUSAN: Ping-Cho. Oh, Ping-Cho, are you ready? "
1027,"PING-CHO: I am ready, Susan. "
1028,"SUSAN: Oh, good. "
1029,"PING-CHO: Gracious maidens, gentle lords, pray attend me while I tell"
1030,"my tale of Ala-eddin, the Old Man of the Mountains, who by devious"
1031,"schemes, evil designs and foul murders ruled the land. "
1032,"No host of arms, no vast array of banners served this wicked lord. They"
1033,"were but few, ruthless, reckless men who obeyed his cruel commands. "
1034,Thus did he persuade them. 
1035,"Promising paradise, he gave his followers a potent draught and whilst"
1036,"they slept transported them to a vale where streams of milk and honey,"
1037,"wine and water, flowed. "
1038,"Here were gardens and flowers of every hue and essence. Here, too"
1039,Golden pavilions outshone the sun and even the stars of heaven envied
1040,"the bejewelled interiors strewn with incomparable silks, tapestries,"
1041,and treasures. 
1042,"Hand-maidens, dulcet-voiced, soft of face, attended them, and thus"
1043,bemused did they dwell in this man-made paradise until Ala-eddin intent
1044,"upon some evil deed, proffered again the hashish draught and brought"
1045,them sleeping to his castle. 
1046,"What lord, are we cast out of paradise? Awakening, they cried. "
1047,"Not so. Go abroad, seek out my enemies and strike them down. But care"
1048,not for your lives. Paradise is eternal. 
1049,"So terror stalked the land for many years. Then one day, came mighty"
1050,Hulagu to stand before Ala-eddin's lair for three long years in siege.
1051,Thus fell Ala-eddin and his men. 
1052,Now honest hands reap harvests of life From the soil where death and
1053,evil reigned. And those who journey through the vale are heard to say
1054,'tis truly paradise today. 
1055,(a well deserved round of applause.) 
1056,(Barbara follows Tegana leaving the room) 
1057,"DOCTOR: That was really delightful, Ping-Cho. "
1058,PING-CHO: My lord is kind. 
1059,"POLO: Thank you, Ping-Cho. "
1060,"IAN: Charming, Ping-Cho, charming. Susan, do you know that we use the"
1061,word Hashashin in English today? 
1062,SUSAN: No. 
1063,IAN: Yes. Assassins. 
1064,SUSAN: Assassin! 
1065,IAN: Yes. 
1066,"SUSAN: Ping-Cho, is the lair of Ala-eddin near here? "
1067,"PING-CHO: No, Susan. It was on a mountain called Mount Alumet in"
1068,Persia. 
1069,SUSAN: Persia? But Messer Marco said that Hulagu killed the Hashashins
1070,near here. 
1071,"POLO: So he did, Susan. Some of Ala-eddin's followers lived near here,"
1072,in the cave of Five Hundred Eyes.

1090,TEGANA: Good. 
1091,ACOMAT: Where he will await news of your success. 
1092,TEGANA: I will not fail him. 
1093,ACOMAT: You failed at Lop. You were to meet our courier on the third
1094,night in the desert. 
1095,TEGANA: There was a sandstorm. 
1096,ACOMAT: He did not return. 
1097,"MALIK: Before the courier left, he spoke of gift to Noghai. "
1098,"TEGANA: Yes, a caravan that flies. It belongs to an old magician who"
1099,accompanies us. Polo's taking it to the Kublai Khan. 
1100,"ACOMAT: With such a caravan, Noghai would be invincible. "
1101,"TEGANA: Yes, that is why you must capture it. You will attack our"

1103,ACOMAT: It shall be done.

1118,have done! What kind of country do you come from where a woman can
1119,wander alone through the streets at night? 
1120,TEGANA: You will never find her alive in Tun-Huang. 
1121,IAN: We won't find her sitting here.

1137,SUSAN: We think we might know where Barbara is. 
1138,"DOCTOR: Oh, where? "
1139,PING-CHO: Messer Marco was telling us about the Cave of Five Hundred
1140,Eyes. 
1141,"SUSAN: Yes, and Barbara was very interested. So we thought she might"
1142,"have gone off to a look without asking anybody, because Messer Marco"
1143,might have tried to stop her.

1332,"TEGANA: I'm saying, does a magician need a key to open a door? "
1333,"(Ian, Barbara, Susan and Ping-Cho enter.) "
1334,POLO: How are you feeling? 
1335,BARBARA: Still bit shaky. 
1336,POLO: You realise you're most fortunate to be alive. 
1337,"BARBARA: Yes, I know. "
1338,POLO: Why did you go to the cave? You know my rule about obtaining
1339,permission to leave here. 
1340,"IAN: Tell him, Barbara. "
1341,BARBARA: I followed Tegana there. 
1342,"TEGANA: Me? I've only been there once, and you were there when I"
1343,arrived. 
1344,BARBARA: But that's not true. I followed you there. 
1345,TEGANA: I have only been there once. 
1346,BARBARA: But why would I lie? I was almost killed. 
1347,POLO: Be quiet! 
1348,TEGANA: Mark well all that I have said. 
1349,POLO: Tegana. 
1350,"TEGANA: My friend, mark it well. "
1351,"(Tegana leaves, then eavesdrops from the top of the stairs.) "
1352,"POLO: Ping-Cho, you will remove your belongings to another room. From"
1353,"this night on, you will not share with Susan again. "
1354,PING-CHO: But Messer Marco 
1355,POLO: Obey me!
1356,
1357,POLO : Poor Susan and Ping-Cho. Yet what
1358,alternative had I but to separate them? Now my caravan seethes with
1359,suspicion and discontent as we journey south-west. The route takes us
1360,"to the ancient cities of Su-Chow and Kan-Chow, where the Great Wall of"
1361,"Cathay begins. Following the wall, we travel south to Lan-Chow, which"
1362,"lies on the banks of the Yellow River. Here, our route swings north,"
1363,"and with the river always in sight, we journey towards Shang-Tu."

1366,
1367,"DOCTOR: The trouble is, Polo's change of attitude"
1368,has slowed down my progress on the circuit. 
1369,"IAN: I think you've done brilliantly to make any progress at all,"
1370,Doctor. 
1371,BARBARA: How much longer do you think you'll need? 
1372,"DOCTOR: Well, with a bit more time, and a lot of luck, I should say"
1373,about another night. 
1374,"BARBARA: But that's marvellous, Doctor. "
1375,DOCTOR: The following evening will even be better. 
1376,BARBARA: And that's when we say goodbye to Marco Polo. 
1377,"DOCTOR: Yes, and a jolly good riddance. "
1378,"BARBARA: Well, I shall be jolly glad to leave here. In fact, the only"
1379,regrets I'll have will be for Susan. 
1380,DOCTOR: What do you mean? 
1381,"BARBARA: Oh, I think she and Ping-Cho are very fond of each other. It's"
1382,a pity they've been kept apart so much. 
1383,DOCTOR: It's a pity there was any association at all. That Chinese
1384,child makes me nervous. 
1385,IAN: What on Earth do you mean? 
1386,DOCTOR: She found out about the key. 
1387,IAN: What? 
1388,"DOCTOR: Yes, on the night that Barbara was captured. Susan and Ping-Cho"
1389,"thought Barbara had gone down to the cave and met with an accident, so"
1390,they came looking for me just as I was about to enter the Tardis. It
1391,was then Ping-Cho saw the key.
1392,
1393,[Outside the tent]
1394,
1395,"SUSAN: Ping-Cho, what's the matter? "
1396,"PING-CHO: For me this journey, in spite of all the dangers, was the"
1397,"happiest time of my life, until Tun-Huang. "
1398,SUSAN: What did Tegana say to make Messer Marco change so much? Did you
1399,ask Messer Marco? 
1400,"PING-CHO: A hundred times, but he remains silent. "
1401,SUSAN: If only we could find out. If only we could prove that Tegana
1402,had seen the Cave of Five Hundred Eyes before. 
1403,PING-CHO: It won't make much difference soon. 
1404,SUSAN: Why not? 
1405,PING-CHO: You will be leaving. 
1406,SUSAN: Leaving? 
1407,PING-CHO: Your grandfather must have nearly finished the work in your
1408,caravan by now. 
1409,"SUSAN: Ping-Cho, he has. "
1410,PING-CHO: Will you go home? Will you say goodbye to me before you
1411,leave? 
1412,SUSAN: Of course I will. 
1413,PING-CHO: Even if it is very late? 
1414,"SUSAN: No matter what time of night it is. Hey, this'll cheer you up. "
1415,PING-CHO: What? 
1416,SUSAN: I'd forgotten you knew anything about the key. 
1417,(But Tegana has been eavesdropping)
1418,
1419,"POLO : For the past three days, I have followed"
1420,the course of the Yellow River as it flows north to the small town of
1421,"Sinju, which lies nestled against the Great Wall."

1424,
1425,"POLO: Have you seen my clothing bag, Tegana? "
1426,"TEGANA: Er, yes, it's in the passageway outside your door. "
1427,POLO: Thank you. 
1428,"TEGANA: Oh, I want to go into town. "
1429,POLO: Very well. 
1430,TEGANA: Thank you. 
1431,(Polo and Tegana leave) 
1432,PING-CHO: The passageway. Why have I not thought of it before? Susan?
1433,"Susan, I've got proof. I can prove it! "
1434,SUSAN: What? 
1435,PING-CHO: That Tegana lied. 
1436,POLO: You can prove what? 
1437,"PING-CHO: Messer Marco, do you remember Tegana's reply when Miss Wright"
1438,said she had followed him to the Cave of Five Hundred Eyes? 
1439,"POLO: Yes, he said he'd never been there before. "
1440,"PING-CHO: He lied, Messer Marco. "
1441,"POLO: You bring a very serious charge, Ping-Cho. I hope you have proof."
1442,
1443,"PING-CHO: When he came into the cave, Susan's grandfather showed him"
1444,"Miss Wright's handkerchief, saying we had found it over there, and the"
1445,old lord pointed to a dark corner of the cave. And do you remember what
1446,he said? He asked if we had found it in the passageway. 
1447,POLO: Well? 
1448,"PING-CHO: If he had never been to the cave before, how could he know"
1449,that the dark corner was a passageway? 
1450,SUSAN: Yes. 
1451,POLO: This is your proof? You call this evidence? 
1452,"PING-CHO: Yes, Messer Marco. "
1453,POLO: And on these grounds you dare to call the War Lord Tegana a liar?
1454,"You foolish child, how dare you make such a reckless accusation."
1455,"Believe me, it will take much more than this to shake my confidence in"
1456,Tegana.

1459,
1460,ACOMAT: It was your fault. You should have killed
1461,them all when you 
1462,"TEGANA: You listen to me, Acomat, and you listen well. The day after"
1463,"tomorrow, the caravan sets out to cross the bamboo forest. On the"
1464,"second night, I shall silence the guard, and then when all is well, I"
1465,shall signal you with a burning torch. Then you will move in and
1466,"slaughter them all. But with stealth, mind you. "
1467,ACOMAT: And the magician's caravan? 
1468,"TEGANA: You will send that on to Noghai, whilst I will continue on to"
1469,Shang-Tu with terrible stories of bandit attacks. 
1470,ACOMAT: Polo? 
1471,"TEGANA: Well, I should let Polo die like an old woman in her bed. "
1472,ACOMAT: The old magician. How can you kill him? 
1473,TEGANA: With a stake through the heart.

1480,BARBARA: Yes. 
1481,"(But there's a guard posted near Tardis, so the Doctor hides and waits"
1482,until he walks away. Then he uses the real key to let himself into the

1488,BARBARA: Ian? 
1489,"(As the Doctor works in the Tardis, Barbara talks to Ian and Susan) "
1490,BARBARA: I think Tegana must have seen him going into it. 
1491,IAN: Where's Tegana now? 
1492,BARBARA: I don't know. 
1493,IAN: Stay here. 
1494,(Ian looks around the courtyard) 
1495,IAN: Not a sign of him. Where's Marco? 
1496,SUSAN: He must be in his room. 
1497,"IAN: Good. Now listen. Go and get the Doctor out of the ship, then"
1498,"hide. I'm going to try a bluff. If it works, we may be able to turn the"
1499,"tables on Tegana. Now, go quickly. "
1500,"(Barbara and Susan leaves, then Polo comes down the stairs) "
1501,"IAN: Ah, Marco, I was just coming to have a word with you. "
1502,POLO: What about? 
1503,"IAN: Well, I should have thought that was pretty obvious. "
1504,"POLO: Be more explicit, Ian. "
1505,"IAN: Oh, come on Marco, we're friends aren't we? "
1506,POLO: We were. 
1507,"IAN: Well, why the sudden change? And tell me, why separate Susan and"
1508,Ping-Cho? 
1509,POLO: Susan's a bad influence. 
1510,"IAN: Oh, you can't really mean that. "
1511,"POLO: Ping-Cho's first loyalty is to me, yet she backed you against"
1512,Tegana. 
1513,"IAN: Perhaps that's because we were telling the truth. It is possible,"
1514,you know. 
1515,"POLO: Let me tell you something, Ian. Tegana is a special emissary of"
1516,"Noghai, on his way to talk peace with Kublai Khan. He's a very"
1517,important man. You are mysterious travellers from some far off land I
1518,"know nothing about. Now, if you were in my position, a servant of"
1519,"Kublai Khan, whose word would you take? "
1520,"IAN: Well, I should keep an open mind. "
1521,(Tegana enters.) 
1522,"TEGANA: Marco, I have something rather interesting to show you. "
1523,POLO: What is it? 
1524,TEGANA: The old magician is in his caravan. 
1525,"POLO: He's what? Is this true, Ian? "
1526,"IAN: Well, why don't we go outside and have a look?"
1527,
1528,[Sinju Way Station Courtyard]
1529,
1530,POLO: Are you sure about this? 
1531,TEGANA: He's got another key. I saw him go inside. 
1532,IAN: So all we can do now is wait for him to come out. 
1533,POLO: This you are prepared to do? 
1534,"IAN: If it'll convince you that Tegana is making trouble, we can wait"
1535,here all night. 
1536,"POLO: Tegana, are you absolutely positive? "
1537,"TEGANA: When the War Lord Tegana says it is so, Marco, it is so. He is"
1538,in there. 
1539,(The Doctor comes out of the Tardis) 
1540,"IAN: Doctor, lock the door quickly! "
1541,"POLO: I'm sorry I doubted your word, Tegana. Give me the key, Doctor. "
1542,DOCTOR: No. 
1543,POLO: You're an old man and I do not wish to use force. 
1544,"DOCTOR: That is what you'll precisely have to do, Polo. "
1545,(Tegana wrenches the key from the Doctor) 
1546,TEGANA: Did I not say he had another key? 
1547,"DOCTOR: Put that key in the lock, Polo, and you will destroy the ship."
1548,"Then where will your precious Khan be, hmmm? You need more than a key"
1549,to enter my ship. You need knowledge. Knowledge you will never possess.
1550,
1551,POLO: Tell me. 
1552,"DOCTOR: No, understand? No! I'd let you wreck it first! "
1553,POLO: Guards! Guards! 
1554,(The guards have already taken Barbara and Susan) 
1555,DOCTOR: Let go of me! 
1556,"POLO: Bear witness. I wear the gold seal of Kublai Khan, and by the"
1557,"authority it invests in me, I do hereby seize and hold your caravan in"
1558,his name. Be warned. Any resistance to this decree is instantly
1559,punishable by death. 
1560,"DOCTOR: You poor, pathetic, stupid savage. "
1561,POLO: Take them away! 
1562,"TEGANA: Marco, are you now convinced which of us makes trouble?"
1563,
1564,POLO : What a nightmare this journey has
1565,"become. Our progress is impeded because Tegana, the bearers and I must"
1566,"constantly be on the alert for any signs of trouble from the prisoners,"
1567,and Ping-Cho's resentment of me only serves to make my task more
1568,difficult. But I have succeeded in keeping her away from them by
1569,setting up a separate tent for the Doctor and his companions.
1570,
1571,[Doctor's Tent]
1572,
1573,IAN: We can't go on like this. We must get out! 
1574,(He breaks a plate) 
1575,BARBARA: That's easier said than done. 
1576,"IAN: I know Barbara. I know the odds are against us, but at least we've"
1577,got to try. 
1578,"DOCTOR: Yes, I quite agree with you. The ship's waiting outside, with"
1579,the circuit finished and installed. 
1580,BARBARA: And Polo has both keys. 
1581,"DOCTOR: Oh, that wretched child. "
1582,"SUSAN: Grandfather, Ping-Cho wouldn't tell him about the second key. I"
1583,know she wouldn't. 
1584,"DOCTOR: Oh, my dear Susan "
1585,"IAN: Oh, don't you worry about that now. We must concentrate on getting"
1586,one of those keys back. 
1587,"DOCTOR: Yes, and the only way I can see it, is that we should have to"
1588,capture Polo. 
1589,IAN: Why not? Take him hostage. 
1590,BARBARA: But we're hopelessly outnumbered. 
1591,"IAN: Only by day. At night, we've got the edge on them. They've only"
1592,"got one guard, remember. "
1593,"SUSAN: Yes, but how are you going to disarm him? "
1594,IAN: I don't know. Somehow. I'll do it. 
1595,"DOCTOR: Now just a minute. First things first, young man. How are we"
1596,"going to get out of here, and remember that guard is out there watching"
1597,"for us, hmmm? "
1598,(Ian picks up a piece of broken plate.) 
1599,IAN: With this. I'll cut my way out. 
1600,DOCTOR: That's a very good idea. Good. 
1601,"IAN: As soon as I've dealt with that guard, I'll come back for you. "
1602,DOCTOR: Right. 
1603,"SUSAN: Grandfather, supposing Messer Marco won't give him the keys? "
1604,"DOCTOR: Don't worry, my child. I think by the time I've finished with"
1605,"that gentleman, he'll only be too glad to let us go. "

1754,"DOCTOR: No, it wasn't the devils in the fire. Their leader was killed."
1755,That's why they broke up and ran. 
1756,"TEGANA: Well, in battle all men face death. "
1757,"DOCTOR: And few expect to meet it, hmm? "
1758,"POLO : At sunrise, we buried the dead, broke"
1759,"camp, travelled to the edge of the bamboo forest, and out beyond it"
1760,"onto the plain. But at midday, as we were all tired after the events of"
1761,"the previous night, I ordered a halt."
1762,
1763,[Tent]
1764,
1765,"(The Doctor, Ian and Barbara are sitting at a"
1766,table) 
1767,"BARBARA: Surely he can't punish us! By trying to escape, we saved his"
1768,life. 
1769,"DOCTOR: If that fool had any decency at all, he'd let us go. "
1770,"IAN: I doubt if he'll do that, Doctor. "
1771,"DOCTOR: Well, then we must go on trying to escape. The circuit's"
1772,"finished, and all we need are those keys. "
1773,"IAN: That's not going to be very easy, is it, after last night. Marco's"
1774,bound to be on his guard. 
1775,(Polo and Tegana enter.) 
1776,POLO: I have a question to ask all of you. Will you promise on your
1777,"honour, not to attempt another escape? "
1778,(silence) 
1779,POLO: So be it. 
1780,DOCTOR: We sacrificed our freedom to save you. 
1781,"POLO: Yes, I know. And in return, I revoke the seizure of your caravan"
1782,by official decree. 
1783,"DOCTOR: Huh. Very noble of you, I'm sure. "
1784,"IAN: What you're really saying, Marco, is that we're no longer Kublai"
1785,"Khan's prisoners, only yours? "
1786,POLO: That's right. 
1787,DOCTOR: Thanks for nothing. 
1788,POLO: All the freedoms you enjoyed before will be restored. Susan and
1789,"Ping-Cho can share each other's company, and no guards will watch you"
1790,by night. 
1791,DOCTOR: And the keys to the Tardis? 
1792,"POLO: As before, Doctor, they remain with me. And I shall be guarded"
1793,day and night. 
1794,"TEGANA: Marco, let me be your sword. "
1795,"POLO: You are in my charge, Tegana, not I in yours. "
1796,(Polo leaves.) 
1797,"TEGANA: Work your magic on him if you will, but make no move against"
1798,me. 
1799,(Tegana leaves.) 
1800,IAN: He knows we're on to him. 
1801,DOCTOR: Strange that Tegana should watch the fire. A sort of menial job
1802,he'd order a guard to do. 
1803,BARBARA: How could he? The guard was dead. 
1804,"IAN: Tegana wasn't to know that, otherwise he'd have given the alarm. "
1805,DOCTOR: Would he? 
1806,IAN: You mean he was implicated in the attack? 
1807,DOCTOR: Of course he was. The bandit knew him. I'm certain he did. 
1808,"BARBARA: Ian, do you remember that bandit we buried this morning? I"
1809,knew I'd seen him somewhere before. He was in the Cave of Five Hundred
1810,Eyes. 
1811,"DOCTOR: Yes, and he had to kill him or be exposed. "
1812,IAN: But what's Tegana's game? What's he after? 
1813,DOCTOR: My ship. 
1814,"IAN: Oh, no, Doctor, he's terrified of it. It must be something else."
1815,"Whatever it is, we're in the way, that's for sure. "
1816,BARBARA: Marco too? 
1817,IAN: I don't know. Maybe. 
1818,"BARBARA: Well, shouldn't we warn "
1819,"DOCTOR: No, no, ssh ssh. We mustn't be impetuous. We must choose the"
1820,right moment carefully. 
1821,(Susan and Ping-Cho enter with Ling-Tau.) 
1822,SUSAN: This is a courier from Kublai Khan. Have you seen Messer Marco?

1825,"LING-TAU: Thank you, my lady. "
1826,PING-CHO: I will fetch him. 
1827,SUSAN: His name is Ling-Tau.

1837,"POLO: Ask him to wait, please. I'll be with him in a moment. Ping-Cho,"
1838,do I have your word not to tell anyone where these keys are?

1845,IAN: Yesterday! 
1846,BARBARA: What? 
1847,"DOCTOR: But that's three hundred miles away, isn't it? "
1848,LING-TAU: We change horses every league my lord. 
1849,IAN: Every league. 
1850,"LING-TAU: That's the reason we wear these, my lord (bells around his"
1851,waist) To warn the post-house of our arrival. And when we get there a
1852,"fresh horse is saddled and waiting, ready for the next three miles. "
1853,BARBARA: And you ride without rest until you reach your destination? 
1854,"LING-TAU: Yes, my lady. "
1855,DOCTOR: I would have thought it was a physical impossibility. 
1856,"LING-TAU: Our bodies would be shaken to pieces, my lord, were it not"
1857,"for these. Bound tight, like this one, on my head. "
1858,"IAN: Tell me, are there many men who can ride such long distances"
1859,without a break? 
1860,"LING-TAU: We are few, my lord. "
1861,DOCTOR: Three hundred miles a days on horseback. Very few people can
1862,ride more than twenty five. 
1863,"LING-TAU: It's in our blood, my lord. We all come from the great"

1867,LING-TAU: My lord Polo?

1871,POLO: Thank you. 
1872,(Ling-Tau hands over his message) 
1873,POLO: Thank you. (reads) We must leave here at once. 
1874,"PING-CHO: Why, Messer Marco? "
1875,POLO: Kublai Khan wishes to see me without delay. Six days hard riding
1876,"from here is the city of Cheng-Ting, where we can take horses and ride"
1877,on to Shang-Tu. 
1878,"PING-CHO: But our possessions, Messer Marco? "
1879,POLO: They will have to follow on one of the many trade caravans that
1880,travels the route. 
1881,DOCTOR: And the Tardis? 
1882,"POLO: That too must follow on, Doctor."
1883,
1884,POLO : My only concern now is to reach the
1885,"Summer Palace as quickly as possible. So within an hour, we were on the"
1886,"move again, and on the sixth day of our journey, the spires of"
1887,"Cheng-Ting could be seen on our horizon. By later afternoon, we had"
1888,"arrived at the way station of the White City, as Cheng-Ting is often"

1896,"WANG-LO: Oh, how sad. Good day, my gracious ladies. Cheng-Ting is so"
1897,delightful at this time of the year. 
1898,"DOCTOR: Well, where is it? "
1899,POLO: What? 
1900,"DOCTOR: The Tardis. Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear. "
1901,"WANG-LO: I was advised of your pending arrival, my lord Marco, by a"
1902,courier who passed this way from Shang-Tu. 
1903,DOCTOR: Polo? 
1904,POLO: What is it now? 
1905,DOCTOR: I thought you said the Tardis was to be placed in the
1906,courtyard. 
1907,WANG-LO: To what does the old lord refer? 
1908,POLO: His caravan. 
1909,"WANG-LO: Oh, that's what it is! I had it moved. "
1910,DOCTOR: Where to? 
1911,"WANG-LO: The stables, my lord. "
1912,DOCTOR: The stables. 
1913,"WANG-LO: Well, I could hardly leave it in the hanging garden, my lord,"
1914,now could I? 
1915,"POLO: It'll be safe enough there, Doctor. What, when does the next"
1916,commerce caravan leave for Shang-Tu? 
1917,"WANG-LO: The day after tomorrow, my lord. "
1918,"POLO: Will you see that all the baggage goes with it, including that"
1919,caravan? 
1920,"WANG-LO: I shall make it a personal duty, my lord Marco. And now, if"
1921,"you step this way, I'll escort you to your apartment. "
1922,POLO: Thank you. 
1923,(Wang-Lo and Polo leave) 
1924,"DOCTOR: I could hardly have it placed in the hanging garden, now could"
1925,"I? What does he think it is? A potting shed, or something. "

1940,"PING-CHO: How I miss my home in Samarkand. And your home, Susan? You've"
1941,never told me about that. Is it so very far away? 
1942,"SUSAN: Yes, it is. It's as far away as a night star. "
1943,"PING-CHO: But you can reach it from Venice, can't you? "
1944,"SUSAN: No, Ping-Cho, no I can't. "
1945,"PING-CHO: And if Messer Marco does give your caravan to Kublai Khan,"
1946,you will never see your home again? 
1947,SUSAN: That's right. 
1948,"PING-CHO: I gave him my word, Susan. I promised not to tell anyone"

2077,
2078,POLO : A day of hard riding. We left Cheng-Ting
2079,"at dawn, and by dusk had covered forty miles. As this is a densely"
2080,"populated area of Cathay, accommodation is not hard to find, and we"
2081,"have stopped for the night at an inn. Our baggage, including the"
2082,"Doctor's caravan, is following on with a trade caravan."

2092,"IAN: But. Just a minute. Barbara, come here. I. Well, I. "
2093,POLO: Well? 
2094,"IAN: Marco, you must give us back the Tardis. "
2095,POLO: Is that what you want to talk to me about? 
2096,IAN: Yes. 
2097,"POLO: Look, I've told you before, Ian. You know what this caravan means"
2098,"to me. If I give it to the Khan, he'll let me go home. "
2099,"IAN: But we want to go home too, Marco. And we can't go home without"
2100,the Tardis. 
2101,"POLO: I have offered to take you back to Venice with me, and see you"
2102,safely on your way home from there. 
2103,"IAN: By boat. We can't go by boat, Marco, we need the Tardis. "
2104,"POLO: Why, Ian? Why? "
2105,"IAN: All right, I'll tell you why. And I'll tell you the truth. I don't"
2106,"suppose you'll believe it, but still. As I told you, I come from"
2107,England. Barbara as well. 
2108,"POLO: Well, I grant you England's a long way, but the journey's not"
2109,"impossible, Ian. The Crusaders did it. "
2110,"IAN: The Crusaders? Oh, Marco. To me, the Crusaders lived seven hundred"
2111,years ago. 
2112,"POLO: What are you talking about, Ian? The Crusaders were in the Holy"
2113,Land twenty five years ago. 
2114,"IAN: I come from another time. Our caravan, it not only covers"
2115,"distance, it can cross time. "
2116,POLO: Travel into the past and the future? 
2117,"IAN: Yes. I know it's difficult to believe, but it's the truth. "
2118,"POLO: On my travels to Cathay, Ian, I have come to believe many things"
2119,"which I previously doubted. For instance, when I was a boy in Venice,"
2120,they told me that in Cathay there was a stone which burned. I did not
2121,"believe them, but there is such a stone. I have seen it. "
2122,"IAN: It's black, isn't it. "
2123,POLO: Yes. 
2124,IAN: Coal. 
2125,"POLO: In Cathay, we call it the burning stone. And if a stone burns,"
2126,why not a caravan that flies? Birds fly. I have even seen fish that
2127,fly. You are asking me to believe that your caravan can defy the
2128,"passage of the sun? Move not merely from one place to another, but from"
2129,"today into tomorrow, today into yesterday? No, Ian. That I cannot"
2130,accept. 
2131,"IAN: I'm telling you the truth, Marco. "
2132,"POLO: Are you, Ian? "
2133,IAN: I swear it. 
2134,POLO: (holding out the Tardis key) Where did you get that? 
2135,IAN: From your room. 
2136,"POLO: Whereabouts? Where had I hidden it? Come, Ian, surely you know"
2137,"where you found it? You didn't find it, did you? It was given to you,"
2138,"and you lied about finding it to protect Ping-Cho. Ian, don't you see"
2139,it doesn't matter to me why you lied. What is important is the fact
2140,that you are capable of lying. 
2141,IAN: So you don't believe me when I say I came from another time. 
2142,"POLO: If I did Ian, I would give you the key."

2169,POLO: Alone? 
2170,IAN: Why not? I can remember the road we came along. She can't be far.
2171,"But she is in danger, and you yourself can't go. "
2172,"POLO: What do you hope to gain by this gesture, Ian? I'm sorry. When do"
2173,you want to start? 
2174,IAN: As soon as possible. 
2175,POLO: Go with Messer Ian and prepare a horse and provisions. 
2176,(Ian and a bearer leave) 
2177,"BARBARA: Don't worry, Marco. He'll bring her back. You mustn't"
2178,underestimate him.

2186,(He sees someone with an eyepatch waving at him.) Please forgive us.
2187,Excuse me. What do you want? 
2188,KUIJU: The trade caravan to Shang-Tu. 
2189,WANG-LO: Where is the other man? 
2190,KUIJU: The old man is very ill. It's my authority to collect the 
2191,WANG-LO: I see. I've got eyes. It's in the stables. 
2192,KUIJU: Hey! Give that to me! 
2193,"WANG-LO: Now, about your business! "
2194,KUIJU: The old man is a fool. 
2195,WANG-LO: (to other travellers) Please follow me. 
2196,(Ping-Cho approaches Kuiju as he heads for the Tardis) 
2197,PING-CHO: My lord? 
2198,KUIJU: Yes. 
2199,"PING-CHO: Are you with the caravan, my lord? "
2200,"KUIJU: I am, my lady. "
2201,PING-CHO: Is your caravan bound for Samarkand? 
2202,KUIJU: It might. Why? 
2203,"PING-CHO: I would like to journey with your caravan, unless it is going"
2204,to Shang-Tu. 
2205,KUIJU: It's possible. 
2206,PING-CHO: I can pay. 
2207,"KUIJU: Come to think of it, we do strike inland. I'll talk to the"
2208,commander of the caravan. 
2209,PING-CHO: Shall I come with you? 
2210,"KUIJU: No, you wait here. Give me the money. (she does) Don't worry,"
2211,little one. I'll arrange it. 
2212,"(Later, when Kuiju has not returned.) "
2213,WANG-LO: You paid money? You foolish child. You have been robbed. 
2214,PING-CHO: Robbed? What shall I do? It was all the money I had. 
2215,WANG-LO: Haven't I seen you before? Not long since. I know. You were
2216,with Messer Marco Polo's caravan. 
2217,"PING-CHO: No, my lord, no. "
2218,"WANG-LO: What have you done, child? Run away? Oh. "
2219,"(Ian enters, and she runs to him) "
2220,"IAN: Ping-Cho, why did you do it? "
2221,PING-CHO: The key. And I can't marry a man old enough to be my
2222,grandfather. I can't. Please don't take me back. Please. 
2223,"IAN: I must, Ping-Cho. I promised Marco. "
2224,"WANG-LO: I knew I'd seen her before, my lord. Silly child let herself"
2225,be robbed. 
2226,IAN: What? 
2227,"WANG-LO: Oh, some villain, posing as a caravan driver, took all her"
2228,money on the promise of letting her travel inland with the caravan. 
2229,IAN: Where did you meet this man? 
2230,PING-CHO: Here. 
2231,WANG-LO: At my way station? Impossible. 
2232,"PING-CHO: No, my lord, he was in the courtyard with you. "
2233,"WANG-LO: Oh, that one! But he was going to Shang-Tu. I have the"
2234,document authorising him to take the old lord's caravan from the
2235,stables. Here it is. 
2236,"IAN: So the Tardis is on the road to Shang-Tu, eh? "
2237,"WANG-LO: Yes, my lord. "
2238,(The caravan driver arrives) 
2239,"DRIVER: The trade caravan to Shang-Tu, excellency. There is something"
2240,here for us to take. 
2241,"WANG-LO: Oh, but the other man said you were ill. "
2242,DRIVER: What other man? 
2243,WANG-LO: The one that took the old lord's caravan. 
2244,DRIVER: But here is my authorisation. 
2245,WANG-LO: But. But. 
2246,IAN: What's the matter? 
2247,"WANG-LO: Oh, nothing, my lord. Just a slight confusion. I'm sure it can"
2248,be rectified. 
2249,IAN: It's been stolen. The Tardis has been stolen!
2250,
2251,POLO : I hope all is well and Ian has found
2252,"Ping-Cho. Our progress towards Shang-Tu continues to be excellent, and"
2253,"we are now beyond the Great Wall, spending the fourth night of our"
2254,journey at an inn about fifty miles from the Summer Palace.

2258,"TEGANA: You trust too much, and doubt too little!"
2259,"Marco, let me go back after him. "
2260,POLO: I will not agree to this. 
2261,"TEGANA: But, Marco! "
2262,"POLO: Look, it's no good. How will it appear if I stand before the Khan"
2263,without you? You speak for Noghai. Silence could mean war. 
2264,TEGANA: But 
2265,"POLO: You must be at the Summer Palace. You must be, I say. "
2266,"TEGANA: Marco, the magician's caravan. Why do you think Ian offered so"
2267,"readily, so, so eagerly to go back after Ping-Cho? "
2268,POLO: What's your point? 
2269,TEGANA: Ping-Cho could be anywhere. The chances of finding her are very
2270,"small. But, Ian knows where the caravan is. He knows exactly where it"
2271,is. 
2272,"POLO: You're wrong, Tegana. I think I know something of Ian's"
2273,character. 
2274,"TEGANA: You can't know it all. Marco, just give me a strong horse. Now,"
2275,"by using your name, I can bring them both back to you. I can bring the"
2276,"girl to you, and the caravan will be safe. You need the caravan."
2277,"Because when peace is concluded with Kublai Khan, he might very well"
2278,exchange this magician's caravan for your return to Venice.Â 
2279,"TEGANA: Ah, all their sympathies are with Ping-Cho. They are all"
2280,against this marriage. 
2281,POLO: Then why did Ian go back to look for her? 
2282,TEGANA: Exactly. 
2283,"(Susan and Barbara enter, laughing.) "
2284,TEGANA: I'm glad to see that your humour is not impaired by our
2285,misfortune. 
2286,BARBARA: What do you mean? What misfortune? 
2287,"TEGANA: Well, your friend Ian has not returned. We can only assume that"
2288,he's failed to find Ping-Cho. 
2289,"BARBARA: Oh, you haven't given him enough time yet. "
2290,"SUSAN: Anyway, I'm glad. I hope he doesn't. "
2291,"TEGANA: Oh, I see. You want to see her alone, do you? Without friends?"
2292,"She might be kidnapped, murdered. "
2293,"SUSAN: Well, that won't happen to her. She's got money. She can buy a"
2294,safe passage home. 
2295,"TEGANA: Money! Are we all sit in fear for her, and her intended husband"
2296,sits in despair? 
2297,"SUSAN: Oh, even you couldn't be so cruel as to want her to marry a man"
2298,four times her age. 
2299,"TEGANA: Even I? I thank you, lady. And this is your opinion too, I"
2300,suppose? 
2301,BARBARA: I suppose so. 
2302,POLO: One moment. Are you opposed to Ping-Cho's marriage? 
2303,"BARBARA: Look, why are we "
2304,POLO: Answer my question please. 
2305,BARBARA: Yes I am. Completely opposed to it. 
2306,TEGANA: How very unusual for you and Ian to disagree. 
2307,BARBARA: It isn't unusual at all. We don't agree about everything. And
2308,"in this case, we're in complete agreement. All of us. "
2309,POLO: This marriage has the Khan's blessing. Am I to understand that
2310,you oppose it? Am I? 
2311,BARBARA: Yes. 
2312,POLO: All four of you? 
2313,"BARBARA: Yes, all four of us. "
2314,"POLO: Take your horse, Tegana. You have my leave to go. Use my name or"
2315,"such powers as you will, but bring them both to the Summer Palace! "
2316,TEGANA: I shall do so. 
2317,SUSAN: Why did you do that? 
2318,POLO: To make certain. 
2319,SUSAN: Certain of what? 
2320,"POLO: That Ian has gone back to look for Ping-Cho, and not your"
2321,caravan.

2324,
2325,IAN: I've got to find it. I've got to. But where? 
2326,PING-CHO: Perhaps it is still here. 
2327,"IAN: No, no, Ping-Cho. We should have heard. No, it's been taken, all"
2328,right. Is must have been taken by some old road. Some route that's no
2329,longer used. 
2330,PING-CHO: The Karakorum road. 
2331,IAN: Karakorum? But Karakorum's the capital of the Mongol empire. 
2332,PING-CHO: Not any more. Not since the Khan built his palace at Peking. 
2333,"IAN: Yes, but it'll still be an important place. I mean, caravans'll"
2334,still go there. 
2335,PING-CHO: Karakorum was not a city of stone. It was just a collection
2336,"of tents. When the Khan moved, the Mongols dispersed. "
2337,IAN: So the road isn't used any more? 
2338,PING-CHO: Never. 
2339,"IAN: Then, that'll be the answer. "
2340,PING-CHO: Why would someone take the Tardis to Karakorum? 
2341,"IAN: I don't know, Ping-Cho. But until I find it, we shall never leave"

2347,"mighty Kublai Khan, is pleased to grant you an audience. "
2348,POLO: We wait the Great Khan's pleasure. 
2349,DOCTOR: It's all Chinese. Very interesting. It's odd that a Mongol
2350,"should choose Chinese architecture, isn't it? "
2351,SUSAN: Did you see those beautiful pavilions? 
2352,BARBARA: Yes. Weren't they magnificent? 
2353,POLO: Some of them are made of solid gold. 
2354,SUSAN: Are they? 
2355,DOCTOR: What size are the grounds? 
2356,"POLO: Oh, they're enormous. They have to be to accommodate the Khan's"
2357,"two great passions, hunting and falconry. Do you know, in his stables"
2358,he has ten thousand white stallions? 
2359,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, one's enough for me, young man. Red, white or blue."
2360,"VIZIER: When great Kublai Khan appears, you will make your obeisance to"

2364,VIZIER: Kow-tow. Kneel upon the ground and touch your forehead upon the
2365,floor three times. 
2366,DOCTOR: I shall do no such thing! 
2367,VIZIER: Kublai Khan is the mightiest man the world has ever seen. Not
2368,to pay him homage will cost you your head. 
2369,"DOCTOR: Well, if it breaks my back, then he can take all of me. So why"
2370,waste time on small items? 
2371,"SUSAN: Grandfather, please. "
2372,"DOCTOR: Oh, do be quiet child. I'm not going to make a spectacle of "
2373,(a gong sounds) 
2374,VIZIER: Silence! Those who dare to come before the sight of the great
2375,"Kublai Khan, kow-tow. Kow-tow before the War Lord of War Lords. Mighty"
2376,"and fearful in his strength. Kow-tow before the Ruler of Asia, India,"
2377,Cathay and other territories. Kow-tow before the Master of the World.

2398,Marco? 
2399,"POLO: They do, my lord. "
2400,"KHAN: We bid you welcome to our court, ladies. What's the matter with"
2401,him? 
2402,"POLO: Oh, five days hard riding on horseback, my lord. The Doctor's not"
2403,accustomed to it. 
2404,"KHAN: Doctor? Oh, is he? Are you, perchance, a physician? "
2405,"DOCTOR: I am not a doctor of medicine, sire, otherwise I should be able"
2406,to cure these pains. 
2407,"KHAN: Oh, what a pity. Where is the War Lord Tegana? "
2408,"POLO: Riding for Shang-Tu, my lord, with the lady Ping-Cho and a"
2409,companion of theirs. 
2410,KHAN: Noghai's army's encamped at Karakorum. 
2411,"POLO: But that's impossible, my lord. When Tegana joined my caravan,"
2412,Noghai's army was only forty miles north of Samarkand. 
2413,KHAN: Then it stands hundred miles from Shang-Tu. We are very anxious
2414,to hear Tegana's explanation of his master's conduct. 
2415,"POLO: I can understand my lord's concern, and it is my fault that he is"
2416,not here. 
2417,KHAN: We are on our guard against treachery. Our patrols watch the
2418,"Karakorum road, and tomorrow we'll ride for Peking. "
2419,SUSAN: Must we go too? 
2420,VIZIER: Silence. Speak only when you are addressed. 
2421,"KHAN: Tut, tut, tut. What was it you said? "
2422,"SUSAN: Well, I wondered if we might wait for Ping-Cho, my lord. "
2423,"KHAN: No, I think it is better that you ride with us. "
2424,"DOCTOR: Oh, not another horse. "
2425,KHAN: You spoke? 
2426,DOCTOR: I said I don't think I could get on another horse. 
2427,KHAN: Then walk! 
2428,"DOCTOR: In my present condition, sir? And what about that lump of"
2429,"yours, hmmm? "
2430,VIZIER: The Master of the World has a carriage of state. 
2431,"DOCTOR: Well, he's lucky. He won't be jogged about. "

2433,DOCTOR: Thank you.

2445,"KHAN: Oh, dignity. Yes, of course. Now, take my arm, friend. "

2544,"DOCTOR: Genghis Khan? No, I didn't meet him, but I have heard of him."
2545,Yes.

2568,POLO: As my lord commands. The War Lord Tegana has arrived in Peking.
2569,"When he reaches the palace, shall I bring him directly to you? "
2570,"KHAN: No. No, we'll grant him an audience as soon as possible. Oh, we"
2571,"want to tell you something, Marco. We owe half of Asia to our friend at"
2572,backgammon. 
2573,"POLO: It is unusual for you to lose, my Lord. "
2574,"KHAN: Oh, he is a fortunate one. But our friend here made a truly royal"
2575,"gesture which we have accepted, although it might upset you. "
2576,POLO: Why should it do that? 
2577,KHAN: That's our last game. Our losses against your gift to me. 
2578,POLO: The caravan? 
2579,"DOCTOR: Yes, Marco. We're playing for the Tardis. "
2580,POLO: But my Lord 
2581,KHAN: Well? 
2582,"POLO: Nothing, my Lord. I will leave you to your game. "
2583,DOCTOR: My throw. 
2584,"KHAN: But. Yes, your throw."
2585,
2586,[Peking Palace Cloister]
2587,
2588,"POLO: You will not believe this, but I swear it's"
2589,true. They're playing backgammon for your caravan. 
2590,BARBARA + SUSAN: What? 
2591,"POLO: If the Doctor wins, he has won back Tardis. "
2592,BARBARA: And if he loses? 
2593,POLO: He's lost everything. 
2594,"SUSAN: Oh, Grandfather will win. I hope. "
2595,"POLO: The sly old fox. The Khan hasn't even seen it yet, and he's"
2596,taking it away from me. 
2597,BARBARA: Then this will solve everything. You've made your gesture and
2598,"given the Tardis to the Khan, so he should let you go home. And with"
2599,"any luck, we can go home too. So we'll all have what we want. "
2600,"SUSAN: Yes, all except Ping-Cho. "
2601,"POLO: Yes, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about her, Susan. Her"
2602,future husband is already in Peking. 
2603,SUSAN: What in the palace? 
2604,"POLO: Yes, there is to be a banquet tonight in his honour, at which six"
2605,thousand guests will attend. 
2606,SUSAN: Six thousand! 
2607,POLO: He's a very important man. 
2608,BARBARA: He must be. When is the wedding? 
2609,POLO: Tomorrow morning. 
2610,SUSAN: Poor Ping-Cho. 
2611,"LING-TAU: My lord, Polo. "
2612,"POLO: Yes? Oh, you're the courier that brought me the message from"
2613,"Shang-Tu, aren't you? "
2614,LING-TAU: I am my Lord. 
2615,POLO: It's a pleasure to see you again. 
2616,"LING-TAU: No, my Lord, I fear not. "
2617,POLO: Why? What is wrong? 
2618,"LING-TAU: Two members of your party, the lord known as Ian, and the"
2619,"lady Ping-Cho, are being held under guard. "
2620,POLO: Why? 
2621,LING-TAU: They're accused of stealing the Khan's property. 
2622,BARBARA: The Tardis? 
2623,"POLO: Well, who accuses them? "
2624,BARBARA: Tegana. 
2625,"LING-TAU: Yes, my lady. "
2626,BARBARA: That man is 
2627,"SUSAN: Wait! But Grandfather's going to win back the Tardis, so no"
2628,charges can be brought. 
2629,"POLO: Susan, you don't take your prize until you win the game. "
2630,(The Doctor enters.) 
2631,"SUSAN: Grandfather! Grandfather, you've not lost? "
2632,DOCTOR: He gave me this. A consolation prize. A piece of his paper
2633,currency. 
2634,"SUSAN: Oh, Grandfather!"
2635,
2636,[Palace room]
2637,
2638,POLO: You have told me all? 
2639,IAN: Everything from the moment I found Ping-Cho. 
2640,POLO: And you distinctly heard Tegana say that the Khan was his enemy? 
2641,"IAN: Yes, Tegana said I serve Noghai, and he will conquer the world."
2642,Ping-Cho heard it as well. 
2643,"PING-CHO: Distinctly, Messer Marco. "
2644,"POLO: Ling-Tau, did you hear this? "
2645,"LING-TAU: No, my lord. I did not. "
2646,POLO: That's a pity. 
2647,IAN: You mean our word isn't strong enough against Tegana's? 
2648,"PING-CHO: There are two of us, Messer Marco. "
2649,"POLO: No, Ping-Cho. Ian must stand trial alone. "
2650,PING-CHO: Why? 
2651,POLO: Your husband-to-be has asked the Khan to excuse you. He promises
2652,to take you away from Peking as soon as the marriage ceremony is over. 
2653,PING-CHO: And the Khan has agreed? 
2654,POLO: You are to be married tomorrow morning. 
2655,[Peking Throne room]
2656,
2657,(Tegana and the Khan are inspecting the Tardis) 
2658,KHAN: So this is our flying caravan. Thank you for recovering it for
2659,"us, Lord Tegana. "
2660,TEGANA: Good fortune gave me the opportunity of serving the great Khan.
2661,
2662,KHAN: The lady Ping-Cho has been excused of complicity in the theft. 
2663,TEGANA: The Khan shows much wisdom and compassion. What crimes she
2664,committed were done under the influence of others. 
2665,KHAN: Crimes? Who else was there? 
2666,"TEGANA: The old magician, my lord, tried several times to regain the"
2667,caravan. 
2668,KHAN: Were there other attempts to steal it? Marco did not mention them
2669,to us. 
2670,"TEGANA: Is that not natural, my lord, that he would wish to guard them?"
2671,
2672,KHAN: You have served us well. 
2673,"TEGANA: In dealings with Mongols like ourselves, yes, my lord. But he"
2674,is as they are. And does not one's loyalty first lie with one's own
2675,kind? 
2676,"KHAN: Your point is taken, Lord Tegana. "
2677,(Polo enters.) 
2678,"KHAN: Marco, thank you for our gift. "
2679,POLO: I am the Khan's obedient servant. 
2680,"KHAN: We are glad to know. But then, there were other attempts to steal"
2681,the caravan? Why did you not invoke our laws? 
2682,"POLO: To have done so would have been unjust, my lord. Our laws are"
2683,alien to them. 
2684,"KHAN: They were on our soil, therefore, subject to our laws. Why did"
2685,you not invoke them? 
2686,"POLO: The caravan belonged to them, my lord. "
2687,"TEGANA: My lord, I can hold my peace no longer. Forgive me. How can"
2688,that be? You claimed it in the Khan's name? 
2689,POLO: It was wrong of me to do so. 
2690,TEGANA: You wear the Khan's gold seal. It gives you your authority to
2691,take what you will. 
2692,POLO: When the cause is just. This was not. 
2693,KHAN: What was it then? 
2694,POLO: Selfish. 
2695,KHAN: What did you hope to gain? 
2696,TEGANA: He wanted to force you to let him return to Venice. 
2697,"KHAN: You wanted to bribe us, Marco? "
2698,"POLO: I'd hoped you would allow me to return home, my lord. "
2699,KHAN: Your gift has failed. It is ours because we won the right to keep
2700,it in a game of chance. Where is the key? 
2701,"POLO: In my quarters, my lord. "
2702,"KHAN: Bring it to us after the banquet, and then we'll examine our"
2703,prize. 
2704,"POLO: My lord, you do me a great wrong. "
2705,"KHAN: We are distressed and angered by your conduct, Marco. Please"
2706,"think about it. You'll also attend us after the banquet, Lord Tegana."
2707,We'll discuss the terms of our settlement with Noghai. But we be on
2708,guard against you. 
2709,TEGANA: What have I that the Khan should fear? 
2710,KHAN: The power of persuasion.
2711,
2712,[Peking Throne room - later that evening]
2713,
2714,KHAN: Dead! And in the middle of the feast. How
2715,shall we tell her? Terrible! Horrible! Terrible and horrible! Horrible
2716,and terrible! 
2717,"(Polo, Ping-Cho and Ling-Tau enter) "
2718,"KHAN: Oh, here you are, my child. Come, we have something to tell you."
2719,A tragedy has occurred at the table tonight. 
2720,"PING-CHO: Tragedy, my lord? "
2721,"KHAN: Your beloved husband-to-be, so anxious to be worthy of your love,"
2722,"drank a potion of quicksilver and sulphur, the elixir of life and"
2723,"eternal youth, and expired. "
2724,"EMPRESS: Come into my arms, child. Let me share your grief. "
2725,"KHAN: You're overdoing it, my dear, the child is dry-eyed. "
2726,"EMPRESS: Oh, ungrateful wretch! Do you not weep for your lost love? "
2727,"PING-CHO: My lady, I grieve an old man's death as all would do. But how"
2728,can I weep for a love I have never known? 
2729,"KHAN: Tell us, Ping-Cho. Do you wish to return to your home in"
2730,Samarkand? Or would you like to stay a while in our Court and brighten
2731,all our days? 
2732,"PING-CHO: If I may, my lord, I would like to stay. "
2733,"KHAN: So be it. Wait, Marco. Tell us, my child, your opinion of the"
2734,travellers from a distant land? 
2735,"PING-CHO: They are my friends, my lord. As they will always be. "
2736,"KHAN: Thank you, Ping-Cho. Wait, Marco. Let that young officer escort"
2737,lady Ping-Cho to her quarters.
2738,(Ping-Cho and Ling-Tau leave) 
2739,"KHAN: She is forthright and honest. We trust her, as we once did you."
2740,"Our mind dwells upon your conduct, Marco, and we've decided that you"
2741,"have to prove yourself worthy of our trust. If you fail this to do, we"
2742,"take from you our patronage, banish you from our Court, and let your"
2743,enemies fall upon you. You have the key of the caravan? 
2744,"POLO: Yes, my lord, but you would be well advised to have the Doctor"
2745,with you when you open it. 
2746,"KHAN: Fetch him, Marco, fetch him. No, wait. Not until our audience"
2747,with the Lord Tegana is concluded. 
2748,[Outside the Throne room]
2749,
2750,"POLO: I underestimated you, Tegana. "
2751,"TEGANA: No, you overestimated yourself."
2752,
2753,[Palace room]
2754,
2755,SUSAN: The Khan won't even see us. 
2756,DOCTOR: What's the point. We've tried everything. 
2757,BARBARA: What's Tegana's game? 
2758,"IAN: Well, we can be quite clear about that. Tegana said, I serve"
2759,Noghai and he will conquer the world with the help of the Tardis. 
2760,DOCTOR: I always knew Tegana was a two-faced villain. 
2761,"SUSAN: Yes, well, that doesn't help Ian, does it? He's got to take the"
2762,blame. 
2763,BARBARA: I wish I could remember what it was the Khan said that upset
2764,Marco so much. 
2765,IAN: What's it matter now? 
2766,"BARBARA: Well, it was something about Noghai and Tegana. "
2767,SUSAN: I'm sure Tegana was behind that bandit raid. But why? 
2768,DOCTOR: It wasn't just my ship then. Whatever double-game Tegana is
2769,"playing, he must have decided upon a long time before we appeared on"
2770,the scene. 
2771,BARBARA: I remember! 
2772,DOCTOR: Hmmm? 
2773,BARBARA: The Khan was furious because Noghai had moved his armies from
2774,Samarkand to Karakorum. 
2775,DOCTOR: And that's why he delayed Marco Polo's caravan. To give Noghai
2776,more time to move his armies nearer Peking. 
2777,"IAN: Yes, that makes sense. Even so, why should Kublai Khan fear"
2778,"Noghai? He has an enormous army, and he's already defeated him once,"
2779,surely. 
2780,"DOCTOR: Yes, but what you have to take into account where battles are"
2781,"concerned, dear boy, are its leaders. Kill the leader, and where are"
2782,you? What happens? The whole army dissipates itself into chaos and
2783,utter confusion. It's happened throughout your history time and time
2784,again! 
2785,"SUSAN: Grandfather, do you mean to say Tegana's going to assassinate"
2786,the Khan? 
2787,"DOCTOR: Exactly, and what could be a better answer then to disorganise"
2788,everything here. It gives Noghai the perfect answer to overrun the
2789,country. 
2790,"BARBARA: But then, we must get to the Khan before Tegana kills him,"
2791,otherwise. 
2792,IAN: I've had it. 
2793,"DOCTOR: Yes, we've all had it. "
2794,"SUSAN: Look, how are we going to get Ian past the guard? "
2795,(Ian goes to the door and mimes the plan) 
2796,DOCTOR: Guard! Open the door. 
2797,(The guard enters. The Doctor trips him with his stick. Everybody runs
2798,for it.)
2799,
2800,[Corridor]
2801,
2802,SUSAN: Which way? 
2803,IAN: Let's try down here.
2804,(They run on until they meet Polo and a guard) 
2805,IAN: Marco. 
2806,"POLO: Ian, what are you doing, you fool? "
2807,"IAN: Marco, you must stop Tegana! He's going to kill the Khan! "
2808,POLO: Seize him! 
2809,"IAN: Marco, listen to me, Tegana "
2810,"POLO: Take him back to his cell, and keep him under close surveillance."
2811,
2812,"SUSAN: But Messer Marco, you must "
2813,LING-TAU: My lord! 
2814,POLO: What is it? 
2815,LING-TAU: A messenger has just arrived. Noghai's army is marching on
2816,Peking. 
2817,POLO: Tegana's in the throne room with the Khan now. 
2818,"DOCTOR: Well, then, look, somebody must protect him. "
2819,"POLO: Hold that, Doctor, and stay here, all of you. "
2820,(Polo gives a parchment to the Doctor and runs off)
2821,
2822,[Peking Throne room]
2823,
2824,"TEGANA: Your terms of peace are hard, my lord. "
2825,"KHAN: Tegana, those who rise against us must be humbled. "
2826,TEGANA: They shall be honoured. I promised Noghai to make an end of
2827,this matter. 
2828,"(Tegana draws his sword, and kills the Vizier by mistake.) "
2829,POLO: Tegana! 
2830,(Polo and Tegana have a sword fight in front of a growing crowd. Polo
2831,wins. Ling-Tau and warriors enter to take charge of Tegana. Then the
2832,Doctor and co. arrive) 
2833,"KHAN: We warned you, Tegana, those who rise against us will be humbled."
2834,You must die. 
2835,(Tegana grabs a sword and kills himself.) 
2836,"POLO: Take him away. Doctor, take the keys quickly. "
2837,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
2838,POLO: Now go. 
2839,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
2840,POLO: Go. 
2841,DOCTOR: Come along. 
2842,"PING-CHO: Susan, goodbye. "
2843,"SUSAN: Bye, Ping-Cho. "
2844,"PING-CHO: Your caravan, quickly. "
2845,SUSAN: Goodbye! 
2846,(The Tardis dematerialises) 
2847,"POLO: I'm sorry, my lord. I had to give them back their flying caravan."
2848,
2849,"KHAN: If you hadn't, the old man would have won it at backgammon. And"
2850,it is true. A flying caravan. There's something for you to tell your
2851,friends in Venice. 
2852,"POLO: No, my lord. They would not believe half the things that I have"
2853,seen in Cathay. But what is the truth? I wonder where they are now? The
2854,past or the future?
