22, (Near a planet with a thick cloudy atmosphere and
23,a lovely view of the Horse Head Nebula.) 
24,TANNOY: Would all passengers please return to their seats and fasten
25,their safety belts? We are experiencing slight turbulence. 
26,"(Things are going Bang! on the bridge, which is strongly modelled on"
27,the Starship Enterprise.) 
28,"CAPTAIN: Both engines failed, and the storm-gate's critical. The ship"
29,is going down. Christmas is cancelled. 
30,PILOT: Entering atmosphere now. Level. Keep her level. 
31,CO-PILOT: Level with what? I can't see. What is that stuff? 
32,CAPTAIN: Clouds? 
33,PILOT: What kind of clouds? 
34,(Distress signal activated.) 
35,CAPTAIN: Are you sending a distress signal? 
36,PILOT: It's not me. 
37,(Location: Honeymoon suite.) 
38,CAPTAIN: Who's in the honeymoon suite? 
39,"(Amy enters, wearing her stripper policewoman outfit.) "
40,AMY: I've sent for help. 
41,CAPTAIN: Who the hell are you? 
42,"AMY: Look, there's a friend of mine, okay? And he can help us. He'll"
43,come. 
44,CAPTAIN: And what are you wearing? 
45,AMY: That doesn't matter. 
46,CAPTAIN: Are you from the honeymoon suite? 
47,"AMY: Oh, shut up. "
48,(Enter a Roman Centurion.) 
49,"RORY: Amy, the light's stopped flashing Does that mean he's coming? "
50,PILOT: Honeymoon suite? 
51,"RORY: Oh. Oh, the clothes. Er. It is just a bit of fun. "
52,"AMY: Really, shut up. "
53,CO-PILOT: Sensor loss on eighty percent of the hull. 
54,"RORY: So, does this mean he's coming, or does it mean I need to change"
55,the bulb? 
56,AMY: He'll come. He always comes. 
57,"RORY: Right. Well, he is cutting it kind of fine. "
58,"CAPTAIN: If we can't stabilise the orbit, we're finished. "
59,CO-PILOT: There's nothing to lock onto. I am flying blind. 
60,"AMY: Come on, Doctor, come on. "
61,"CO-PILOT: There's something coming alongside us. Something small, like"
62,a shuttle. 
63,"AMY: Just this once, don't be late. "
64,PILOT: Ma'am. Incoming message. It's from the other ship. 
65,CAPTAIN: On screen. 
66,(Message reads - Come along Pond.) 
67,CAPTAIN: What does that mean? 
68,AMY: It's Christmas.

71,
72,(Down below the thick cloud layer is a bustling
73,"metropolis, dominated by a domed building sending an energy beam into"
74,"the sky. A scruffy boy runs through a market area, slightly alien"
75,Dickensian.) 
76,"SARDICK: : On every world, wherever people are, in the deepest part"
77,"of the winter, at the exact mid-point, everybody stops and turns and"
78,"hugs, as if to say, well done. Well done, everyone. We're halfway out"
79,"of the dark. Back on Earth, we called this Christmas, or the Winter"
80,"Solstice. On this world, the first settlers called it the Crystal"
81,Feast. 
82,SARDICK: You know what I call it? I call it expecting something for
83,nothing. 
84,"(Hello, Ebenezer Scrooge. He turns from the little window and walks"
85,into a massive room with just a pieces of furniture around a large but
86,"empty fireplace. A poor family are waiting for him, a man, an old woman"
87,and a young boy.) 
88,BENJAMIN: Sir. Mister Sardick. We're only asking for one day. Just let
89,her out for Christmas. She loves Christmas. 
90,"(A cryochamber is wheeled in, containing a young woman.) "
91,"SARDICK: Does she? Oh, does she? I see. Hello. Wakey, wakey. It's"
92,Christmas. Do you know what? I think she's a bit cool about the whole
93,"thing. Ha, ha! That was funny. "
94,(The servants chuckle obediently.) 
95,BOY: She's frozen. 
96,"SARDICK: She's what, sorry? "
97,BOY: She's in the ice. She can't hear you. 
98,"SARDICK: Oh, what a clever little boy. You must be so irritated. How"
99,much? 
100,(A servant brings an account.) 
101,"SERVANT: Er, it's four thousand five hundred Gideons, sir. "
102,"SARDICK: You took a loan of four thousand five hundred Gideons, and"
103,Little Miss Christmas is my security. 
104,(How very Monty Python Merchant Banker. Another servant brings in a
105,ringing candlestick telephone.) 
106,BENJAMIN: We're not asking for her back. Just let her have one day. Let
107,her have Christmas with us. 
108,"SERVANT: Sir, it's the President. "
109,"SARDICK: Tell him I'm busy. Now, where were we? Oh, yes. She's pretty,"
110,"though, your daughter. Maybe I should keep her. "
111,"BENJAMIN: She's not my daughter, sir. "
112,ISABELLA: She's my sister. She volunteered for the ice when the family
113,were in difficulties many years ago. 
114,"SERVANT: Sorry, sir. The President says there's a galaxy class ship"
115,"trapped in the cloud layer and, well, we have to let it land. "
116,SARDICK: Or? 
117,"SERVANT: Well, or it'll crash, sir. "
118,"SARDICK: Oh. Well, it's a kind of landing, isn't it? "
119,"SERVANT: It's from Earth, sir, registering over four thousand lifeforms"
120,on board. 
121,SARDICK: Not if we wait a bit. 
122,"SERVANT: You can't just let it crash, sir. "
123,(The sound of the Tardis arriving nearby.)Â 
124,"SARDICK: Says who? Oh, give it here. "
125,(Sardick takes the telephone.) 
126,"SARDICK: Look, petal, we already have a surplus population. No more"
127,people allowed on this planet. I don't make the rules. 
128,(Soot falls down the chimney.) 
129,"SARDICK: Oh no, hang on, I do. "
130,(Sardick hangs up the receiver.) 
131,"SARDICK: Right, you lot. Poor, begging people. Off home and pray for a"
132,miracle. 
133,(The Doctor tumbles out of the fireplace in a shower of soot.) 
134,DOCTOR: Ah. Yes. Blimey. Sorry. Christmas Eve on a rooftop. Saw a
135,"chimney, my whole brain just went, what the hell. "
136,(He goes to the family.) 
137,"DOCTOR: Don't worry, fat fellow will be doing the rounds later. I'm"
138,"just scoping out the general chimney-ness. Yes. Nice size, good"
139,traction. Big tick. 
140,BENJAMIN: Fat fellow? 
141,"DOCTOR: Father Christmas, Santa Claus or, as I've always known him,"
142,Jeff. 
143,BOY: There's no such person as Father Christmas. 
144,"DOCTOR: Oh, yeah? "
145,(The Doctor produces an old photograph.) 
146,"DOCTOR: Me and Father Christmas, Frank Sinatra's hunting lodge, 1952."
147,See him at the back with the blonde? Albert Einstein. The three of us
148,together. Brrm. Watch out. Okay? Keep the faith. Stay off the naughty
149,list. 
150,(The Doctor spots what looks like a big cinema organ.) 
151,"DOCTOR: Ooo. Now, what's this then? I love this. A big flashy lighty"
152,thing. That's what brought me here. Big flashy lighty things have got
153,"me written all over them. Not actually, but give me time, and a crayon."
154,"Now, this big flashy lighty thing is connected to the spire in your"
155,"dome, yeah? And it controls the sky. Well, technically it controls the"
156,"clouds, which technically aren't clouds at all. Well, they're clouds of"
157,tiny particles of ice. Ice clouds. Love that. Who's she? 
158,SARDICK: Nobody important. 
159,"DOCTOR: Nobody important. Blimey, that's amazing. Do you know, in nine"
160,"hundred years of time and space, I've never met anyone who wasn't"
161,"important before. Now, this console is the key to saving that ship, or"
162,I'll eat my hat. If I had a hat. I'll eat someone's hat. Not someone
163,"who's using their hat. I don't want to shock a nun, or something."
164,"Sorry, rambling, because, because this isn't working! "
165,SARDICK: The controls are isomorphic. One to one. They respond only to
166,me. 
167,"DOCTOR: Oh, you fibber. Isomorphic. There's no such thing. "
168,(Sardick reaches over and switches it off then on again. All the Doctor
169,"gets are annoyed beeps, even with the screwdriver.) "
170,DOCTOR: These controls are isomorphic. 
171,"SARDICK: The skies of this entire world are mine. My family tamed them,"
172,and now I own them. 
173,DOCTOR: Tamed the sky? What does that mean? 
174,SARDICK: It means I'm Kazran Sardick. How can you possibly not know who
175,I am? 
176,"DOCTOR: Well, just easily bored, I suppose. So, I need your help, then."
177,
178,SARDICK: Make an appointment. 
179,DOCTOR: There are four thousand and three people in a spaceship trapped
180,"in your cloud belt. Without your help, they're going to die. "
181,SARDICK: Yes. 
182,DOCTOR: You don't have to let that happen. 
183,"SARDICK: I know, but I'm going to. Bye, bye. Bored now. Chuck. "
184,(The Doctor wriggles out of the clutches of a servant and goes to
185,"Sardick, who is settling into a tall leather armchair by the"
186,fireplace.) 
187,"SARDICK: Ooo, look at you, looking all tough now. "
188,DOCTOR: There are four thousand and three people I won't allow to die
189,tonight. Do you know where that puts you? 
190,SARDICK: Where? 
191,DOCTOR: Four thousand and four. 
192,SARDICK: Was that a sort of threat-y thing? 
193,"DOCTOR: Whatever happens tonight, remember you brought it on yourself. "
194,"SARDICK: Yeah, yeah, right. Get him out of here. And next time, try and"
195,find me some funny poor people. 
196,"(The boy throws a stray piece of coal at Sardick as he, his family and"
197,the Doctor are hustled out. Sardick runs over to hit the child.) 
198,"DOCTOR: No, stop, don't. "
199,BENJAMIN: Don't you dare. You leave him. 
200,SARDICK: Get him out of here. Get that foul-smelling family out of
201,here. Out! 
202,BOY: We're going! 
203,(The Doctor remains behind.) 
204,SARDICK: What? What do you want? 
205,DOCTOR: A simple life. But you didn't hit the boy. 
206,"SARDICK: Well, I will next time. "
207,"DOCTOR: You see, you won't. Now why? What am I missing? "
208,SARDICK: Get out. Get out of this house. 
209,"DOCTOR: The chairs. Of course, the chairs. Stupid me, the chairs. "
210,SARDICK: The chairs? 
211,"DOCTOR: There's a portrait on the wall behind me. Looks like you, but"
212,"it's too old, so it's your father. All the chairs are angled away from"
213,"it. Daddy's been dead for twenty years, but you still can't get"
214,comfortable where he can see you. There's a Christmas tree in the
215,"painting, but none in this house, on Christmas Eve. You're scared of"
216,"him, and you're scared of being like him, and good for you, you're not"
217,"like him, not really. Do you know why? "
218,SARDICK: Why? 
219,"DOCTOR: Because you didn't hit the boy. Merry Christmas, Mister"
220,Sardick. 
221,SARDICK: I despise Christmas. 
222,DOCTOR: You shouldn't. It's very you. 
223,SARDICK: It's what? What do you mean? 
224,DOCTOR: Halfway out of the dark. 
225,(The servants return and the Doctor leaves.) 
226,SARDICK: Get her downstairs with the others. And clean up this mess.
227,
228,[Starliner]
229,
230,CO-PILOT: Everything's offline. Secondary furnace
231,just vented. 
232,(Amy is on the phone to the Doctor.) 
233,AMY: Have you got a plan yet? 
234,[Sardicktown]
235,
236,"DOCTOR: Yes, I do."
237,
238,[Starliner]
239,
240,AMY: Are you lying?
241,
242,[Sardicktown]
243,
244,"DOCTOR: Yes, I am. "
245,[Starliner]
246,
247,AMY: Don't treat me like an idiot. 
248,RORY: Was he lying? 
249,"AMY: No, no. "
250,DOCTOR : Okay 
251,[Sardicktown]
252,
253,DOCTOR: The good news. I've tracked the machine
254,that unlocks the cloud belt. I could use it to clear you a flight
255,corridor and you could land easily.
256,
257,[Starliner]
258,
259,"AMY: Oh, hey. Hey, that's great news."
260,
261,[Sardicktown]
262,
263,DOCTOR: But I can't control the machine. 
264,[Starliner]
265,
266,AMY: Less great.
267,
268,[Sardicktown]
269,
270,DOCTOR: But I've met a man who can. 
271,"AMY: Ah, well "
272,[Starliner]
273,
274,AMY: There you go.
275,
276,[Sardicktown]
277,
278,DOCTOR: And he hates me. 
279,AMY : Were you being 
280,[Starliner]
281,
282,AMY: Extra charming and clever?
283,
284,[Sardicktown]
285,
286,DOCTOR: Yeah. How did you know? 
287,[Starliner]
288,
289,AMY: Lucky guess.
290,
291,[Sardicktown]
292,
293,BENJAMIN: Sir? Sir. 
294,DOCTOR: Hang on. 
295,BENJAMIN: I've never seen anybody stand up to Mister Sardick like that.
296,"Bless you, sir, and merry Christmas. "
297,"DOCTOR: Merry Christmas. Lovely. Sorry, bit busy. "
298,"BENJAMIN: You'd better get inside, sir. The fog's thick tonight, and"
299,there's a fish warning. 
300,"DOCTOR: All right, yeah. Sorry, fish? "
301,BENJAMIN: Yeah. You know what they're like when they get a bit hungry. 
302,"DOCTOR: Yeah, fish, I know fish. Fish? "
303,"BENJAMIN: It's all Mister Sardick's fault, I reckon. He always lets a"
304,few fish through the cloud layer when he's in a bad mood. Thank you.
305,"Bless you once again, sir. "
306,DOCTOR: Fish?
307,
308,[Starliner]
309,
310,"AMY: Doctor, the Captain says we've got less than"
311,an hour. 
312,[Sardicktown]
313,
314,AMY : What should we be doing? 
315,(There is a shoal of tiddlers swimming around a street light.) 
316,DOCTOR: Fish. 
317,"AMY : Sorry, what? "
318,DOCTOR: Fish that can swim in fog. I love new planets. 
319,AMY : Doctor. 
320,[Starliner]
321,
322,"AMY: Doctor, please don't get distracted."
323,
324,[Starliner]
325,
326,(The little fish nibble at the Doctor's
327,outstretched fingers while a big shadow passes some way behind him.) 
328,"DOCTOR: Now, why would people be frightened of you tiny little fellows?"
329,"Look at you, sweet little fishy-wishies. Mind you, fish in the fog, so"
330,the cloud cover. Ooo. Careful up there.
331,
332,[Starliner]
333,
334,"AMY: Oh great, thanks, Doctor, because there was a"
335,real danger we were all going to nod off. We've got less than an hour!
336,
337,[Sardicktown]
338,
339,(The town clock shows 11 o'clock.) 
340,DOCTOR: I know. 
341,TANNOY: Ding dong merrily on high 
342,AMY : Doctor? 
343,[Starliner]
344,
345,AMY: How are you getting us off here? 
346,[Sardicktown]
347,
348,"DOCTOR: Oh, just give me a minute. Can't use the"
349,"Tardis, because it can't lock on. So, that ship needs to land. But it"
350,can't land unless a very bad man suddenly decides to turn nice just in
351,time for Christmas Day.
352,
353,[Starliner]
354,
355,"AMY: Doctor, I can't hear you. What is that? Is"
356,that singing?
357,
358,[Sardicktown]
359,
360,DOCTOR: A Christmas carol. 
361,[Starliner]
362,
363,AMY: A what?
364,
365,[Sardicktown]
366,
367,DOCTOR: A Christmas carol. 
368,[Starliner]
369,
370,AMY: A what?
371,
372,[Sardicktown]
373,
374,DOCTOR: A Christmas Carol! 
375,TANNOY: Hosanna in excelsis. 
376,AMY : Doctor? 
377,TANNOY: Gloria 
378,DOCTOR: Kazran Sardick. 
379,AMY : Doctor! 
380,"DOCTOR: Merry Christmas, Kazran Sardick. "
381,TANNOY: Hosanna in excelsis. 
382,[Kazran's bedroom]
383,
384,(The old Kazran Sardick is sleeping in his big
385,"leather chair, when we are shown a video recording of a young boy in"
386,his
387,pajamas. The lad is making a video diary on his computer.) 
388,"KAZRAN: Hello, my name is Kazran Sardick. I'm twelve and a half, and"
389,this is my bedroom. 
390,[Main room]
391,
392,SARDICK: Top secret special project. 
393,[Kazran's bedroom]
394,
395,KAZRAN: This is my top secret special project. For
396,my eyes only. Merry Christmas. 
397,ELLIOT : Kazran! 
398,[Main room]
399,
400,(Old Sardick wakes at the shout from his father.
401,The scene with his young self is being projected on the far wall where
402,the main door
403,is. Elliot Sardick is played as a caricature of Lord Alan Sugar.) 
404,"ELLIOT [on screen]: Kazran! Kazran, what are you doing? What are you"
405,"doing? I've warned you before about this, you stupid, ignorant,"
406,ridiculous child. 
407,KAZRAN [on screen]: I was just going to make a film of the fish. 
408,ELLIOT [on screen]: The fish are dangerous. 
409,KAZRAN [on screen]: I just want to see them. 
410,ELLIOT [on screen]: Don't be stupid. You're far too young. 
411,KAZRAN [on screen]: Everyone at school's seen the fish. 
412,"ELLIOT [on screen]: That's enough. You'll be singing to them next, like"
413,gypsies. 
414,KAZRAN [on screen]: The singing works. I've seen it. The fish like the
415,singing. 
416,ELLIOT [on screen]: What does it matter what fish like? 
417,KAZRAN [on screen]: People say we don't have to be afraid of the fish.
418,They're not really interested in us. 
419,ELLIOT [on screen]: You don't listen to people. You listen to me. 
420,"(Elliot, the Sardick father, hits Kazran, the boy, who is now an old"
421,man. Sardick flinches as if he had been hit.) 
422,"KAZRAN [on screen]: Ow! I'm sorry, Father. "
423,"ELLIOT [on screen]: This is my house. While you're under my roof,"
424,you'll obey my instructions. I don't care what you
425,(The Doctor touches Sardick on the shoulder.) 
426,"DOCTOR: It's okay, it's okay. "
427,SARDICK: What have you done? What is this? 
428,DOCTOR: Found it on an old drive. Sorry about the picture quality. Had
429,"to recover the data using quantum enfolding and a paperclip. Oh, I"
430,wouldn't bother calling your servants. They quit. Apparently they won
431,"the lottery at exactly the same time, which is a bit lucky when you"
432,think about it. 
433,SARDICK: There isn't a lottery. 
434,"DOCTOR: Yeah, as I say, lucky. "
435,ELLIOT [on screen]: There's a fog warning tonight. You keep these
436,"windows closed, understand? Closed. "
437,SARDICK: Who are you? 
438,"DOCTOR: Tonight, I'm a Ghost Of Christmas Past. "
439,ELLIOT [on screen]: Mrs Mantovani will be looking after you tonight.
440,You stay here till she comes. Do you understand? Do you understand? 
441,"DOCTOR: Did you ever get to see a fish, back then, when you were a kid?"
442,
443,SARDICK: What does that matter to you? 
444,DOCTOR: Look how it mattered to you. 
445,"SARDICK: I cried all night, and I learned life's most invaluable"
446,lesson. 
447,DOCTOR: Ah. Which is? 
448,SARDICK: Nobody comes. Get out! Get out of my house! 
449,"DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, but I'll be back. Way back. Way, way back. "
450,"(The Doctor goes through the door and into the Tardis, which"
451,dematerialises in the now and rematerialises outside
452,Kazran's window.) 
453,DOCTOR [on screen]: See? Back. 
454,KAZRAN [on screen]: Who are you? 
455,DOCTOR [on screen]: Hi. I'm the Doctor. I'm your new babysitter. 
456,KAZRAN [on screen]: Where's Mrs Mantovani? 
457,"DOCTOR [on screen]: Oh, you'll never guess. Clever old Mrs Manters, she"
458,only went and won the lottery. 
459,SARDICK: There isn't any lottery. 
460,KAZRAN [on screen]: There isn't any lottery. 
461,DOCTOR [on screen]: I know. What a woman. 
462,"KAZRAN [on screen]: If you're my babysitter, why are you climbing in"
463,the window? 
464,"DOCTOR: Because if I was climbing out of the window, I'd be going in"
465,the wrong direction. Pay attention. 
466,KAZRAN [on screen]: But Mrs Mantovani's always my babysitter. 
467,DOCTOR [on screen]: Times change. Wouldn't you say? You see? Christmas
468,Past. 
469,KAZRAN [on screen]: Who are you talking to? 
470,"DOCTOR [on screen]: You. Now, your past is going to change. That means"
471,"your memories will too. Bit scary, but you'll get the hang of it. "
472,KAZRAN [on screen]: I don't understand. 
473,DOCTOR [on screen]: I'll bet you don't. I wish I could see your face. 
474,SARDICK: But that never happened. But it did. 
475,[Kazran's bedroom]
476,
477,"DOCTOR: Right then, your bedroom. Great. Let's see."
478,"You're twelve years old, so we'll stay away from under the bed."
479,"Cupboard! Big cupboard. I love a cupboard. Do you know, there's a thing"
480,called a face spider. It's just like a tiny baby's head with spider
481,"legs, and it's specifically evolved to scuttle up the backs of bedroom"

483,What are we going to do? Eat crisps and talk about girls? I've never
484,"actually done that, but I bet it's easy. Girls? Yeah? "
485,KAZRAN: Are you really a babysitter? 
486,DOCTOR: I think you'll find I'm universally recognised as a mature and
487,responsible adult. 
488,(He shows Kazran the psychic paper.) 
489,KAZRAN: It's just a lot of wavy lines. 
490,"DOCTOR: Yeah, it's shorted out. Finally, a lie too big. Okay, no, not"
491,"really a babysitter, but it's Christmas Eve. You don't want a real one."
492,You want me. 
493,KAZRAN: Why? What's so special about you? 
494,DOCTOR: Have you ever seen Mary Poppins? 
495,KAZRAN: No. 
496,DOCTOR: Good. Because that comparison would've been rubbish. Fish in
497,the fog. Fish in the clouds. How do people ever get bored? How did
498,boredom even get invented? 
499,KAZRAN: My dad's invented a machine to control the cloud belt. Tame the
500,"sky, he says. The fish'll be able to come down, but only when we let"
501,them. We can charge whatever we like. 
502,DOCTOR: Yeah. I've seen your dad's machine. 
503,(A shark glides past behind the Doctor's back. The window is still
504,open.) 
505,KAZRAN: What? You can't have. 
506,DOCTOR: Tame the sky. Human beings. You always manage to find the
507,"boring alternative, don't you? You want to see one? A fish. We can do"
508,that. We can see a fish. 
509,KAZRAN: Aren't you going to tell me it's dangerous? 
510,"DOCTOR: Dangerous? Come on, we're boys. And you know what boys say in"
511,the face of danger. 
512,KAZRAN: What? 
513,DOCTOR: Mummy.

521,KAZRAN: Are there any face spiders in here? 
522,"DOCTOR: Nah, not at this time of night. They'll all be sleeping in your"
523,mattress.
524,"So, why are you so interested in fish? "
525,KAZRAN: Because they're scary. 
526,DOCTOR; Good answer. 
527,KAZRAN: What kind of tie is that? 
528,DOCTOR: A cool one. 
529,KAZRAN: Why is it cool? 
530,DOCTOR: Why are you really interested in fish? 
531,"KAZRAN: My school. During the last fog belt, the nets broke and there"
532,"was an attack. Loads of them. A whole shoal. No one was hurt, but it"
533,was the most fish ever seen below the mountains. 
534,DOCTOR: Were you scared? 
535,KAZRAN: I wasn't there. I was off sick. 
536,"DOCTOR: Ooo, lucky you. Not lucky. "
537,KAZRAN: It's all anyone ever talks about now. The day the fish came.
538,Everyone's got a story.

606,KAZRAN: What's happening? 
607,"DOCTOR: Well, concentrating on the plusses, you've definitely got a"

609,"I understand how the fog works, which is going to help me land a"

629,"DOCTOR: Well, maybe we're going to eat it, but I don't like the odds."
630,"It's stuck, though. Let's see. Tiny shark brain. If I had my"
631,"screwdriver, I could probably send a pulse and stun it. "
632,"KAZRAN: Well, where's your screwdriver? "
633,"DOCTOR: Well, concentrating on the plusses, within reach. You know,"
634,there's a real
635,chance the way it's wedged in the doorway is keeping its mouth open. 
636,KAZRAN: There is? 
637,"DOCTOR: Just agree with me, because I've only got two goes, and then"

649,KAZRAN: Doctor? I think she's dying. 
650,"DOCTOR: Half my screwdriver's still inside, but yeah, I think so. I"
651,doubt they can survive long outside the cloud belt. Just quick raiding
652,trips on a foggy night. 
653,KAZRAN: Can't we get it back up there? We were just going to stun it. I
654,didn't want to kill it.

726,(Kazran starts a recording.) 
727,"ABIGAIL: My name is Abigail Pettigrew, and I'm very grateful for Mister"
728,Sardick's kindness. My father 
729,KAZRAN: She starts to talk about the fish in a minute. 
730,ABIGAIL: But I would not allow it. I could not have chosen this path
731,were it not for the compassion and generosity of the great
732,"philanthropist and patron of the poor, Mister Elliot Sardick. But I'm"
733,"also surrounded by the fish, the beautiful, iridescent, magical fish. "

735,ABIGAIL: they dash beneath the light as they dart through the fog.

764,KAZRAN: The fish love the singing. It's true. 
765,"DOCTOR: Nah. The notes resonate in the ice crystals, causing a delta"

767,"KAZRAN: Shut up, then. "
768,ABIGAIL: Heaven and earth shall flee away 
769,DOCTOR: Of course. That's how the machine controls the cloud belt. The
770,clouds are ice crystals. If you vibrate the crystals at exactly the

982,"DOCTOR: Yeah, I think you're right. "
983,KAZRAN: I've never kissed anyone before. What do I do? 
984,"DOCTOR: Well, try and be all nervous and rubbish and a bit shaky. "
985,KAZRAN: Why? 
986,DOCTOR: Because you're going to be like that anyway. Might as well make
987,"it part of the plan, then it'll feel on purpose. Off you go, then. "
988,"KAZRAN: What, now? I kiss her now? "
989,"DOCTOR: Kazran, trust me. It's this or go to your room and design a new"
990,"kind of screwdriver. Don't make my mistakes. Now, go. "
991,"(Kazran returns to Abigail, who pulls him to her and kisses him. "
992,"In the future, Sardick looks at pictures of them both in front of the"
993,"Statue of Liberty, Uluru - or Eyres Rock if you prefer - Sydney Opera"
994,"House, Empire State Building, Eiffel Tower. One says California 1952 on"
995,the back. The three are in front of the Hollywood sign.)
996,
997,[Hollywood 1952]
998,
999,(A party is going on out of sight. Kazran comes to
1000,"find his love, who is alone"
1001,by the swimming pool.) 
1002,"KAZRAN: Abigail, are you coming back? The Doctor is going to do a duet"
1003,with Frank. Abigail? What's wrong? 
1004,ABIGAIL: I have something to tell you. 
1005,KAZRAN: A bad thing? 
1006,ABIGAIL: A very bad thing. 
1007,KAZRAN: What is it? 
1008,ABIGAIL: The truth. 
1009,(The Doctor appears from behind a tree as Abigail and Kazran are
1010,kissing. His has lipstick on his face.) 
1011,"DOCTOR: Guys, we've really got to go quite quickly. I just accidentally"
1012,got engaged to Marilyn Monroe. How do you keep going like that? Do you
1013,"breathe out your ears? Hello? Sorry. Hello? Guys, she's phoned a"
1014,chapel. There's a car outside. This is happening now. 
1015,MARILYN: Yoo-hoo! 
1016,DOCTOR: Yoo-hoo. Right. Fine. Thank you. I'll just go and get married
1017,"then, shall I? See how you like that. Marilyn? Get your coat! "
1018,(The Doctor leaves. Kazran and Abigail end their kiss.) 
1019,KAZRAN: What are we going to do? 
1020,ABIGAIL: There is nothing to be done.
1021,
1022,[Cryovault]
1023,
1024,"KAZRAN: Good night, Abigail. "
1025,"ABIGAIL: Good night, Kazran. "
1026,(Kazran seals Abigail in her cryochamber.) 
1027,"DOCTOR: There we go. Another day, another Christmas Eve. I'll see you"
1028,"in a minute, eh? I mean, a year. "
1029,"KAZRAN: Doctor? Listen, why don't we leave it? "
1030,"DOCTOR: Sorry, leave what? "
1031,"KAZRAN: Oh, you know, this. Every Christmas Eve. It's getting a bit"
1032,old. 
1033,DOCTOR: Old? 
1034,"KAZRAN: Well, Christmas is for kids, isn't it? I've got some work with"
1035,my dad now. I'm going to focus on that. Get that cloud belt under
1036,control. 
1037,"DOCTOR: Sorry, I didn't realise I was boring you. "
1038,KAZRAN: Not your fault. Times change. 
1039,"DOCTOR: Not as much as I'd hoped. Kazran. I'll be needing a new one,"
1040,anyway. What the hell. 
1041,(The Doctor gives Kazran his half a screwdriver.) 
1042,"DOCTOR: Merry Christmas. And if you ever need me, just activate it."
1043,I'll hear you. 
1044,KAZRAN: I won't need you. 
1045,DOCTOR: What's happened? What are you not telling me? What about
1046,Abigail? 
1047,KAZRAN: I know where to find her. 
1048,DOCTOR: Yeah. 
1049,(The counter on the cryochamber is down to 000 001.)
1050,
1051,[Main room]
1052,
1053,(Sardick looks around. His father's portrait is
1054,"back. Meanwhile, in the past,"
1055,the Wurlitzer is ready.) 
1056,"ELLIOT: Another Christmas Eve, Kazran. But a very special one. It's"
1057,complete. Look at it. Sound waves. As simple as that. We can control
1058,"the clouds, the fog, the fish. "
1059,KAZRAN: Why do we want to control the fish? 
1060,"ELLIOT: People are cattle. If you want to control cattle, you need to"
1061,control their predators. What's the face for? Look what I'm giving you.
1062,"The sky, and everything beneath it. Only you and I can control this."
1063,This planet is ours. 
1064,"KAZRAN: Excuse me, Father. "
1065,(Kazran returns to his room and takes the screwdriver from his desk
1066,drawer. The Doctor is standing outside the window. Kazran draws the
1067,curtains on him and puts the screwdriver back. Time passes and old
1068,Sardick takes it out again.
1069,"Shortly after, the telephone rings. Sardick answers it.) "
1070,"SARDICK: Yes, what? Oh, Mister President, we've been through this. It's"
1071,"not going to crash on my house, so what's it got to do with me? Yes, I"
1072,know. four thousand and three. As a very old friend of mine once took a
1073,"very long time to explain, life isn't fair. "
1074,(A hologram of Amy appears.) 
1075,AMY: Hello. 
1076,SARDICK: Who are you? What are you doing here? 
1077,"AMY: You didn't think this was over, did you? I'm the Ghost of"
1078,Christmas Present. 
1079,SARDICK: A ghost? Dressed like that? 
1080,(Amy is replaced by Rory.) 
1081,RORY: Eyes off the skirt. 
1082,(Amy pushes him out of the way.) 
1083,SARDICK: You turned into a Roman. 
1084,"AMY: Yeah. Yeah, I do that. I also do this. "
1085,SARDICK: Do what? What are you talking about? 
1086,"VOICES : Silent night, holy night. "
1087,[Cryovault]
1088,
1089,"PEOPLE: (sing) All is calm, all is bright, round"
1090,"yon virgin mother and child, Holy infant so tender and mild. Christ the"
1091,Saviour is born. Christ the Saviour is born. 
1092,"AMY: They're holograms. Projections, like me. "
1093,SARDICK: Who are they? 
1094,AMY: The people on the ship up there. The ones that you're going to let
1095,die tonight. 
1096,SARDICK: Why are they singing? 
1097,AMY: For their lives. Which one's Abigail? The Doctor told me. 
1098,SARDICK: Did he now? 
1099,"AMY: AH, he doesn't hold back. You know the Doctor. "
1100,SARDICK: How do I? I never met him before tonight. Now I seem to have
1101,known him all my life. How? Why? 
1102,AMY: You're the only person who can let that ship land. He was trying
1103,to turn you into a nicer person. And he was trying to do it nicely. 
1104,"SARDICK: He's changed my past, my whole life. "
1105,AMY: Time can be rewritten. 
1106,"SARDICK: You tell the Doctor. Tell him from me, people can't. "
1107,"(Sardick walks through the holograms, which vanish, to a particular"
1108,cryochamber.) 
1109,AMY: That's Abigail? 
1110,SARDICK: I would never have known her if the Doctor hadn't changed the
1111,course of my whole life to suit himself. 
1112,"AMY: Well, that's good, isn't it? "
1113,SARDICK: No. 
1114,AMY: Why is she still in there? You could let her out any time. 
1115,"SARDICK: Oh, yes. Any time at all. Any time I choose. "
1116,AMY: Then why don't you? 
1117,SARDICK: This is what the Doctor did to me. Abigail was ill when she
1118,went into the ice. On the point of death. I suppose the rest in the ice
1119,helped her. But she's used up her time. All those Christmas Eves with
1120,"me. I could release her any time I want, and she would live a single"
1121,"day. So tell me, Ghost of Christmas Present, how do I choose which day?"
1122,
1123,"AMY: I'm sorry. I really am. I'm very, very sorry. But you know what?"
1124,She's got more time left than I have. More than anyone on this ship. 
1125,SARDICK: Good. 
1126,"AMY: Rory, widen the beam."
1127,
1128,[Starliner]
1129,
1130,CAPTAIN: Status update on engine one. 
1131,SARDICK: How did I get here? 
1132,AMY: You didn't. It's your turn to be the hologram. Since you're going
1133,"to let a lot of people die, I thought you might like to see where it's"
1134,all going to happen. 
1135,SARDICK: The singing. What is it? I don't understand. 
1136,RORY: It's the Doctor's idea. The harmonies resonate in the ice
1137,"crystals, that's why thee fish like it. He thought maybe it would"
1138,stabilise the ship. But it isn't working. It's not powerful enough. 
1139,"SARDICK: Why are they still singing, then? "
1140,"CAPTAIN: Because we haven't told them. Sir, I understand you have a"
1141,"machine that controls this cloud layer. If you can release us from it,"
1142,we still have time to make a landing. Nobody has to die. 
1143,SARDICK: Everybody has to die. 
1144,AMY: Not tonight. 
1145,SARDICK: Tonight's as good as any other. How do you choose? 
1146,AMY: Doctor? 
1147,DOCTOR : Yeah? 
1148,AMY: Are you hearing this? 
1149,DOCTOR : I can hear. 
1150,SARDICK: He's here? Where is he? Doctor?
1151,
1152,[Cryovault]
1153,
1154,SARDICK: Doctor! 
1155,DOCTOR: I'm sorry. I didn't realise. 
1156,"SARDICK: All my life, I've been called heartless. My other life, my"
1157,"real life, the one you rewrote. Now look at me. "
1158,DOCTOR: Better a broken heart than no heart at all. 
1159,"SARDICK: Oh, try it. You try it. Why are you here? "
1160,"DOCTOR: Because I'm not finished with you yet. You've seen the past,"
1161,"the present, and now you need to see the future. "
1162,"SARDICK: Fine. Do it. Show me. I'll die cold, alone and afraid. Of"
1163,course I will. We all do. What difference does showing me make? Do you
1164,know why I'm going to let those people die? It's not a plan. I don't
1165,get anything from it. It's just that I don't care. I'm not like you. I
1166,"don't even want to be like you. I don't and never, ever will care. "
1167,DOCTOR: And I don't believe that. 
1168,SARDICK: Then show me the future. Prove me wrong. 
1169,DOCTOR: I am showing it to you. I'm showing it to you right now. So
1170,"what do you think? Is this who you want to become, Kazran? "
1171,(Sardick turns around to see little boy Kazran standing there in his
1172,dressing gown.) 
1173,KAZRAN: Dad? 
1174,(Sardick is about to hit his younger self when he remembers -) 
1175,ELLIOT [memory]: This planet is ours. 
1176,"(And the time he nearly hit Benjamin's son, and kissed Abigail and put"
1177,her back to live for ever. He cries. Kazran cries. They hug each
1178,other.) 
1179,"SARDICK: I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. It's okay, don't be frightened."
1180,"I'm, I'm so, so, so "
1181,DOCTOR: Kazran. We don't have much time.
1182,
1183,[Starliner]
1184,
1185,CO-PILOT: Structural integrity at thirty percent. 
1186,CAPTAIN: We have five minutes max. We need to land. 
1187,"DOCTOR [on viewscreen]: Hello? Hello? Ah, hello, everyone. Prepare to"
1188,lock on to my signal. 
1189,"AMY: Doctor, what's happening? "
1190,DOCTOR [on viewscreen]: I just saved Christmas. Don't go away. 
1191,AMY: Doctor? Doctor! 
1192,[Main room]
1193,
1194,(Sardick is at the controls of his father's mighty
1195,Wurlitzer.) 
1196,"DOCTOR: We good to go, then? "
1197,"SARDICK: The controls, they won't respond. "
1198,DOCTOR: Of course they will. They're isomorphic. They're tuned to your
1199,brainwaves. They'll only respond to you. 
1200,SARDICK: They won't respond. 
1201,DOCTOR: That doesn't make sense. That's ridiculous. Why wouldn't? Oh.
1202,"Oh, of course. Stupid, stupid Doctor. "
1203,"SARDICK: What's wrong? Tell me, what is it? "
1204,DOCTOR: It's you. It's you. I've changed you too much. The machine
1205,doesn't recognise you. 
1206,SARDICK: But my father programmed it. 
1207,"DOCTOR: No, your father would never have programmed it for the man you"
1208,are now. 
1209,SARDICK: Then what do we do? 
1210,"DOCTOR: Er, er, I don't know. I don't know. "
1211,KAZRAN: There must be something. 
1212,"SARDICK: This. You can use this. I kept it, see? "
1213,"DOCTOR: What, half a screwdriver? With the other half up in the sky in"
1214,"a big old shark, right in the heart of the cloud layer. If we use your"
1215,"aerial to boost the signal, set up a resonation pattern between the two"
1216,"halves. Ooo, come on, that would work. My screwdriver, coolest bit of"
1217,kit on this planet. Coolest two bits. It could do it. 
1218,SARDICK: Do what? 
1219,"DOCTOR: Well, my screwdriver is still trying to repair. It's signalling"
1220,"itself. We use the signal, but we send something else. "
1221,KAZRAN: Send what? 
1222,"SARDICK: Well, what? What? "
1223,"DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Kazran. I truly am. "
1224,SARDICK: I don't understand. 
1225,We need to transmit something into the cloud belt. Something we know
1226,works. We need her to sing. 
1227,[Cryovault]
1228,
1229,DOCTOR: Her voice resonates perfectly with the ice
1230,"crystals. It calmed the shark. It will calm the sky, too. "
1231,"SARDICK: Could you do it? Could you do this? Think about it, Doctor."
1232,One last day with your beloved. Which day would you choose? 
1233,ABIGAIL: Christmas. Christmas Day. Look at you. You're so old now. I
1234,"think you waited a bit too long, didn't you? "
1235,SARDICK: I'm sorry. 
1236,"ABIGAIL: Hoarding my days, like an old miser. "
1237,SARDICK: But if you leave the ice now 
1238,"ABIGAIL: We've had so many Christmas Eves, Kazran. I think it's time"
1239,for Christmas Day. 
1240,SARDICK: Yes.
1241,
1242,[Starliner]
1243,
1244,AMY: Doctor! 
1245,CAPTAIN: We can't hold this. Time's up. We're going down. 
1246,AMY: Doctor! 
1247,"CO-PILOT: Captain, I've got. I don't know what I've got. "
1248,(Singing coming over the speakers.) 
1249,CAPTAIN: What is that? What are you listening to? 
1250,CO-PILOT: This is coming from outside. This is coming from the actual
1251,clouds. 
1252,(The turbulence stops as the new Murray Gold song starts.) 
1253,[Sardicktown]
1254,
1255,(The Doctor has hooked up the screwdriver to the
1256,"beam transmitter in the dome, and Abigail is using it as a microphone.)"
1257,
1258,"ABIGAIL: (sings) When you're alone, silence is all you know. "
1259,SARDICK: Well? Well? 
1260,"DOCTOR: Well, the singing resonates in the crystals. It's feeding back"
1261,"and forth between the two halves of the screwdriver. Now, one song,"
1262,filling the sky. The crystals will align and I'll feed in a controlled
1263,"phase loop, and the clouds will unlock. "
1264,"KAZRAN: What does that mean, unlock? What happens when a cloud unlocks?"
1265,
1266,DOCTOR: Something that hasn't happened in this town for a very long
1267,time now. 
1268,"ABIGAIL: (sings) When you're alone, silence is all you see. When you're"
1269,"alone, silence is all you'll be."
1270,
1271,[Starliner]
1272,
1273,ABIGAIL : Give me your hand and come to me. 
1274,PILOT: We're flying normally. 
1275,CAPTAIN: Can you land? 
1276,PILOT: I can even land well. 
1277,"AMY: Oh, he did it. The Doctor did it. "
1278,"RORY: Yeah, he gets all the credit. Which is actually fair enough, if"
1279,you think about it.
1280,
1281,[Sardicktown]
1282,
1283,(It is snowing.) 
1284,"ABIGAIL: (sings) When you are here, music is all around. When you are"
1285,"near, music is all around. Open your eyes, don't make a sound. "
1286,(The shark glides overhead.) 
1287,"SARDICK: Hello, my old friend. "
1288,ABIGAIL: (sings) Let in the shadow. 
1289,DOCTOR: Let's go. 
1290,(Young Kazran goes into the Tardis.) 
1291,"ABIGAIL: (sings) Let in the shadow, let in the light of your bright"
1292,"shadow. Let in the shadow, let in the shadow. "
1293,"(The Doctor goes into the Tardis and it dematerialises, leaving a clear"
1294,square in inch or so of fresh snow.) 
1295,ABIGAIL: (sings) Let in the light of your bright shadow. 
1296,"(Later, the Doctor is rubbing noses with a snowman.) "
1297,"AMY: You know, that could almost be mistaken for a real person. The"
1298,"snowman isn't bad, either. "
1299,"DOCTOR: Ah, yes, you two. About time. Why are you dressed like that? "
1300,"RORY: Er, kind of lost our luggage. Kind of crash landed? "
1301,"DOCTOR: Yeah, but why are you dressed like that at all? "
1302,"AMY: Yeah, they really love their snowmen around here, don't they? I've"
1303,counted about twenty. 
1304,"DOCTOR: Yeah, I've been busy. "
1305,"AMY: Yeah. Yeah, you have. Thank you. "
1306,"DOCTOR: Pleasure. Right, come on then, let's go. "
1307,RORY: Got any more honeymoon ideas? 
1308,"DOCTOR: Well, there's a moon that's made of actual honey. Well, not"
1309,"actual honey, and it's not actually a moon, and technically it's alive,"
1310,"and a bit carnivorous, but there are some lovely views. "
1311,RORY: Yeah. Great. Thanks. 
1312,(Rory goes inside the Tardis.) 
1313,"AMY: Are you, are you okay? "
1314,DOCTOR: Of course I'm okay. You? 
1315,"AMY: Of course. It'll be their last day together, won't it? "
1316,"DOCTOR: Everything has got to end some time, otherwise nothing would"
1317,ever get started. 
1318,RORY: Your phone was ringing. Someone called Marilyn. Actually sounds
1319,like the Marilyn. 
1320,AMY: Doctor? 
1321,DOCTOR: Tell her I'll phone her back. And that was never a real chapel.
1322,
1323,AMY: Where are they? Kazran and Abigail. 
1324,"DOCTOR: Off on a little trip, I should think. "
1325,AMY: Where? 
1326,DOCTOR: Christmas. 
1327,AMY: Christmas? 
1328,"DOCTOR: Yeah, Christmas. "
1329,(Amy joins Rory in the Tardis.) 
1330,DOCTOR: Halfway out of the dark. 
1331,(Sardick and Abigail fly past in their carriage pulled by the shark.)
