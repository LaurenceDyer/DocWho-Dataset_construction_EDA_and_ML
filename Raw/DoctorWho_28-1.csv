23,"(The Doctor is starting to power up the Tardis,"
24,while outside Jackie and Mickey are with
25,"Rose, who has a heavy rucksack on her back.) "
26,JACKIE: Have you got everything? 
27,"ROSE: I've got everything, don't worry. "
28,JACKIE: Be careful. 
29,ROSE: You'll have to call Mo about that 
30,"JACKIE: Oh, never mind Mo. "
31,"ROSE: Okay, I'm going now. I love you! "
32,JACKIE: I love you. 
33,"ROSE: Love you, love you. "
34,(She kisses Mickey.) 
35,MICKEY: Love you. 
36,ROSE: Bye. 
37,(Jackie turns her back and walks away as the Tardis dematerialises.
38,"Mickey watches, sadly.)"
39,
40,[Tardis]
41,
42,ROSE: So where are we going? 
43,DOCTOR: Further than we've ever gone before. 
44,[New Earth]
45,
46,(The Tardis has materialised across the river from
47,a massive city. Flying cars zoom overhead.) 
48,DOCTOR: It's the year five billion and twenty three. We're in the
49,"galaxy M87, and this? This is New Earth. "
50,ROSE: That's just. That's just 
51,DOCTOR: Not bad. Not bad at all. 
52,ROSE: That's amazing. I'll never get used to this. Never. Different
53,"ground beneath my feet, different sky. What's that smell? "
54,DOCTOR: Apple grass. 
55,ROSE: Apple grass. 
56,"DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah. "
57,"ROSE: It's beautiful. Oh, I love this. Can I just say, travelling with"
58,"you, I love it. "
59,DOCTOR: Me too. Come on. 
60,[Basement room]
61,
62,(A humanoid with interesting sepia markings is
63,watching the Doctor and Rose on an electronic crystal ball. He has a
64,gentle Irish brogue.) 
65,"CHIP: Human! She's pure-blood human! Closer, closer. "
66,(A metal spider scuttles to obey.)
67,
68,[New Earth]
69,
70,(The Doctor and Rose are relaxing on his long coat
71,looking at the city.) 
72,"DOCTOR: So, the year five billion, the sun expands, the Earth gets"
73,roasted. 
74,ROSE: That was our first date. 
75,"DOCTOR: We had chips. So anyway, planet gone, all rocks and dust, but"
76,"the human race lives on, spread out across the stars. Soon as the Earth"
77,"burns up, oh yeah, they get all nostalgic, big revival movement, but"
78,"then find this place. Same size as the Earth, same air, same orbit."
79,"Lovely. Call goes out, the humans move in. "
80,ROSE: What's the city called? 
81,DOCTOR: New New York. 
82,"ROSE: Oh, come on. "
83,"DOCTOR: It is. It's the city of New New York. Strictly speaking, it's"
84,"the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New New New"
85,New New New New New New New New New New New York. What? 
86,ROSE: You're so different. 
87,DOCTOR: New New Doctor. 
88,(The spider is close.)
89,
90,[Basement room]
91,
92,CASSANDRA : Impossible. I recognize that child.
93,Her face. Show me her face! 
94,"CHIP: Closer, closer. "
95,CASSANDRA : Face! Face! Face!
96,
97,[New Earth]
98,
99,"ROSE: Can we go and visit New New York, so good"
100,they named it twice? 
101,"DOCTOR: Well, I thought we might go there first. "
102,(An elegant pair of curved skyscrapers standing apart from the city on
103,their side of the river.) 
104,"ROSE: Why, what is it? "
105,DOCTOR: Some sort of hospital. Green moon on the side. That's the
106,universal symbol for hospitals. I got this. A message on the psychic
107,paper. 
108,(Which says -Ward 26 Please Come) 
109,DOCTOR: Someone wants to see me. 
110,"ROSE: Hmm. And I thought we were just sight-seeing. Come on, then."
111,Let's go and buy some grapes. 
112,(The spider watches them leave.)
113,
114,[Basement room]
115,
116,(Lady Cassandra has been restored to her previous
117,"flat, flat state in a somewhat lashed-up frame.) "
118,CASSANDRA: Rose Tyler! I knew it. That dirty blonde assassin. 
119,"CHIP: She's coming here, mistress. "
120,CASSANDRA: This is beyond coincidence. This is destiny. At last I can
121,be revenged on that little
122,
123,[Hospital reception]
124,
125,"(A massive area, courtesy of the Wales Millennium"
126,Centre.) 
127,ROSE: Bit rich coming from you. 
128,DOCTOR: I can't help it. I don't like hospitals. They give me the
129,creeps. 
130,TANNOY: The Pleasure Gardens will now take visitors carrying green or
131,blue identification cards for the next fifteen minutes. Visitors are
132,reminded that cuttings from the gardens are not permitted. 
133,ROSE: Very smart. Not exactly NHS. 
134,DOCTOR: No shop. I like the little shop. 
135,"ROSE: I thought this far in the future, they'd have cured everything. "
136,"DOCTOR: The human race moves on, but so do the viruses. It's an ongoing"
137,war. 
138,(Rose finally notices the faces of the nursing staff in their nun-like
139,wimples and habits.) 
140,ROSE: They're cats. 
141,"DOCTOR: Now, don't stare. Think what you look like to them, all pink"
142,and yellow. That's where I'd put the shop. Right there. 
143,(The Doctor walks into the lift alone.) 
144,"DOCTOR: Ward 26, thanks!"
145,
146,[Basement room]
147,
148,CHIP: Override controls.
149,
150,[Hospital reception]
151,
152,ROSE: Hold on! Hold on! 
153,[Lift]
154,
155,"DOCTOR: Oh, too late. I'm going up. "
156,[Hospital reception]
157,
158,"ROSE: It's all right, there's another lift. "
159,DOCTOR : Ward 26. 
160,[Lift]
161,
162,DOCTOR: And watch out for the disinfectant. 
163,[Basement room]
164,
165,ROSE [on ball]: Watch out for what? 
166,[Lift]
167,
168,DOCTOR: The disinfectant! 
169,[Hospital reception]
170,
171,ROSE: The what? 
172,[Lift]
173,
174,"DOCTOR: The disin. Oh, you'll find out. "
175,[Lift 2]
176,
177,"ROSE: Er, Ward 26, thanks. "
178,"(But her lift heads down, not up.) "
179,[Lift]
180,
181,SPEAKER: Commence stage one disinfection. 
182,(The Doctor gets drenched by a spray.)
183,
184,[Lift 2]
185,
186,SPEAKER: Commence stage one disinfection. 
187,(Rose jumps and shrieks. The next stage is a blow dry. The Doctor
188,enjoys it. Rose finally gets the hang of it.)
189,
190,[Basement]
191,
192,(Chip meets Rose in the rubbish strewn corridor.) 
193,CHIP: The human child is clean. 
194,"ROSE: Er, I'm looking for Ward 26? "
195,"CHIP: This way, Rose Tyler. "
196,(Rose picks up a metal bar and follows carefully.)
197,
198,[Ward 26]
199,
200,TANNOY: Please report to reception. 
201,(The Doctor is escorted by a veiled nurse.)
202,"DOCTOR: Nice place. No shop, downstairs. I'd have a shop. Not a big"
203,"one. Just a shop, so people can shop. "
204,(The nurse removes her veil.) 
205,JATT: The hospital is a place of healing. 
206,DOCTOR: A shop does some people the world of good. Not me. Other
207,people. 
208,"JATT: The Sisters of Plentitude take a lifelong vow to help, and to"
209,mend. 
210,(They pass an open cubicle.) 
211,CLOVIS: Excuse me! Members of the public may only gaze upon the Duke of
212,Manhattan with written permission from the Senate of New New York. 
213,"DOCTOR: That's Petrifold Regression, right? "
214,"DUKE: I'm dying, sir. A lifetime of charity and abstinence, and it ends"
215,like this. 
216,CLOVIS: Any statements made by the Duke of Manhattan may not be made
217,public without official clearance. 
218,DUKE: Frau Clovis! I'm so weak. 
219,"CLOVIS: Sister Jatt. A little privacy, please. "
220,JATT: He'll be up and about in no time. 
221,DOCTOR: I doubt it. Petrifold Regression? He's turning to stone. There
222,"won't be a cure for oh, a thousand years? He might be up and about, but"
223,only as a statue. 
224,JATT: Have faith in the Sisterhood. But is there no one here you
225,recognise? It's rather unusual to visit without knowing the patient. 
226,"DOCTOR: No, I think I've found him. "
227,(A large face in a container by the picture window with a view of the
228,city.) 
229,"JATT: Novice Hame, if I can leave this gentleman in your care? "
230,"DOCTOR: Oh, I think my friend got lost. Rose Tyler. Could you ask at"
231,reception? 
232,"JATT: Certainly, sir. "
233,(Sister Jatt leaves.) 
234,HAME: I'm afraid the Face of Boe's asleep. That's all he tends to do
235,"these days. Are you a friend, or "
236,DOCTOR: We met just the once on Platform One. What's wrong with him? 
237,HAME: I'm so sorry. I thought you knew. The Face of Boe is dying. 
238,DOCTOR: Of what? 
239,HAME: Old age. The one thing we can't cure. He's thousands of years
240,"old. Some people say millions, although that's impossible. "
241,"DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know. I like impossible. I'm here. I look a bit"
242,"different, but it's me, It's the Doctor. "
243,[Basement room]
244,
245,(A reel to reel projector is showing a film of a
246,"party. Cassandra is there, as a proper human woman.) "
247,"CASSANDRA [on film]: I mean, you never know what your life is going to"
248,"be like, ever. I'm bored with this drink. Anyway. Oh, hello darling!"
249,"Now, don't. Stop it. "
250,"ROSE: Wait a minute, that's "
251,CASSANDRA: Peekaboo! 
252,"ROSE: Don't you come anywhere near me, Cassandra. "
253,CASSANDRA: Why? What do you think I'm going to do? Flap you to death? 
254,"ROSE: Yeah, but what about Gollum? "
255,CASSANDRA: Oh that's just Chip. He's my pet. 
256,CHIP: I worship the mistress. 
257,"CASSANDRA: Moisturise me, moisturise me. "
258,(Chip sprays Cassandra.) 
259,CASSANDRA: He's not even a proper life form. He's a force grown clone.
260,I modelled him on my favourite pattern. But he's so faithful. Chip sees
261,to my physical needs. 
262,ROSE: I hope that means food. How comes you're still alive? 
263,CASSANDRA: After you murdered me. 
264,ROSE: That was your own fault. 
265,CHIP: The brain of my mistress survived. And her pretty blue eyes were
266,salvaged from the bin. 
267,"ROSE: What about the skin? I saw it. You, you got ripped apart. "
268,CASSANDRA: That piece of skin was taken from the front of my body. This
269,piece is the back. 
270,ROSE: Right! So you're talking out of your a 
271,CASSANDRA: Ask not. 
272,CHIP: The mistress was lucky to survive. Chip secreted m'lady into the
273,hospital. 
274,ROSE: So they don't know you're here? 
275,"CHIP: Chip steals medicine. Helps m'lady. Soothes her, strokes her. "
276,"ROSE: You can stop right there, Chip. "
277,"CASSANDRA: But I'm so alone, hidden down here. The last Human in"
278,existence. 
279,ROSE: Don't start that again. They've called this planet New Earth. 
280,CASSANDRA: A vegetable patch. 
281,ROSE: And there's millions of Humans out there. Millions of them. 
282,CASSANDRA: Mutant stock. 
283,"ROSE: They evolved, Cassandra. They just evolved, like they should. You"
284,"stayed still. You got yourself all pickled and preserved, and what good"
285,did it do you? 
286,"CASSANDRA: Oh, I remember that night. Drinks for the Ambassador of"
287,Thrace. That was the last time anyone told me I was beautiful. After
288,that it all became such hard work. 
289,"ROSE: Well, you've got a knack for survival, I'll give you that. "
290,"CASSANDRA: But I've not been idle, Rose, tucked away underneath this"
291,hospital. I've been listening. The Sisters are hiding something. 
292,ROSE: What do you mean? 
293,"CASSANDRA: Oh these cats have secrets. Hush, let me whisper. Come"
294,close. 
295,ROSE: You must be joking if you think I'm coming anywhere near you. 
296,"(Energy grabs Rose's hands, holding her still.) "
297,"CASSANDRA: Chip, activate the psychograft. "
298,"ROSE: I can't move. Cassandra, let me go! What're you doing? "
299,(Light streams down from a contraption overhead.) 
300,"CASSANDRA: The lady's moving on. It's goodbye trampoline, and hello"
301,blondie. 
302,(There is a whoosh of energy from Cassandra to Rose then everything
303,switches off. Rose collapses.) 
304,CHIP: Mistress? 
305,"CASS-ROSE: Moisturise me. How bizarre. Arms, fingers, hair! Let me see!"
306,Let me see! Oh my God. I'm a chav! 
307,[Ward 26]
308,
309,"TANNOY: Hope, harmony and health. Hope, harmony and"
310,health. 
311,(The Doctor brings Hame a cup of water.) 
312,HAME: That's very kind. There's no need. 
313,DOCTOR: You're the one working. 
314,"HAME: There's not much to do, just maintain his smoke. And I suppose"
315,"I'm company. I can hear him singing, sometimes, in my mind. Such"
316,ancient songs. 
317,DOCTOR: Am I the only visitor? 
318,HAME: The rest of Boe-kind became extinct long ago. He's the only one
319,left. Legend says that the Face of Boe has watched the universe grow
320,old. There's all sorts of superstitions around him. One story says that
321,"just before his death, the Face of Boe will impart his great secret,"
322,that he will speak those words only to one like himself. 
323,DOCTOR: What does that mean? 
324,HAME: It's just a story. 
325,DOCTOR: Tell me the rest. 
326,HAME: It's said he'll talk to a wanderer. To the man without a home.
327,The lonely God. 
328,[Basement room]
329,
330,CASS-ROSE: Look at me. From class to brass.
331,"Although, oh, curves. Oh, baby, it's like living inside a bouncy"
332,castle! 
333,CHIP: The mistress is beautiful. 
334,"CASS-ROSE: Absolutement! Oh, but look. "
335,(The equipment that had been keeping flat Cassandra alive is fried.) 
336,"CHIP: Oh, the brain lead expired. My old mistress is gone. "
337,CASS-ROSE: But safe and sound in here. 
338,CHIP: But what of the Rose child's mind? 
339,"CASS-ROSE: Oh, tucked away. I can just about access the surface memory."
340,"She's. Gosh, she's with the Doctor. A man. He's the Doctor. The same"
341,Doctor with a new face. That hypocrite! I must get the name of his
342,surgeon. I could do with a little work. Although nice rear bumper. Hmm.
343,
344,(The phone in Rose's back pocket rings.) 
345,"CASS-ROSE: Oh, it seems to be ringing. Is it meant to ring? "
346,CHIP: A primitive communications device. 
347,"DOCTOR : Rose, where are you? "
348,CASS-ROSE: How does she speak? 
349,CHIP: Old Earth Cockney. 
350,"CASS-ROSE: Er, wotcha. "
351,[Ward 26]
352,
353,DOCTOR: Where've you been? How long does it take to
354,get to Ward 26? 
355,"CASS-ROSE : I'm on my way, governor. "
356,[Basement room]
357,
358,CASS-ROSE: I shall proceed up the apples and 
359,[Ward 26]
360,
361,CASS-ROSE : Pears. 
362,DOCTOR: You'll never guess. I'm with the Face of Boe. 
363,[Basement room]
364,
365,DOCTOR : Remember him? 
366,CASS-ROSE: Of course I do.
367,
368,[Ward 26]
369,
370,CASS-ROSE : That big old 
371,[Basement room]
372,
373,CASS-ROSE : Boat race. 
374,[Ward 26]
375,
376,DOCTOR: I'd better go. See you in a minute. 
377,(The Duke of Manhattan is very happy.) 
378,DUKE: Didn't think I was going to make it. It's that man again! He's my
379,good luck charm. Come in. Don't be shy. 
380,CLOVIS: Any friendship expressed by the Duke of Manhattan does not
381,constitute a form of legal contract. 
382,DUKE: Winch me up. Up! Look at me. No sign of infection. 
383,"WAITER: Champagne, sir? "
384,"DOCTOR: No, thanks. You had Petrifold Regression, right? "
385,DUKE: That being the operative word. Past tense. Completely cured. 
386,DOCTOR: But that's impossible. 
387,"CASP: Primitive species would accuse us of magic, but it's merely the"
388,tender application of science. 
389,DOCTOR: How on Earth did you cure him? 
390,"CASP: How on New Earth, you might say. "
391,DOCTOR: What's in that solution? 
392,CASP: A simple remedy. 
393,DOCTOR: Then tell me what it is. 
394,CASP: I'm sorry. Patient confidentiality. I don't believe we've met. My
395,name is Matron Casp. 
396,DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. 
397,CASP: I think you'll find that we're the doctors here. 
398,"JATT: Matron Casp, you're needed in Intensive Care. "
399,CASP: If you would excuse me. 
400,(Casp and Jatt walk away.) 
401,JATT: It's happened again. One of the patients is conscious. 
402,"CASP: Oh, we can't have that. "
403,[Basement room]
404,
405,CHIP: This Doctor man is dangerous. 
406,CASS-ROSE: Dangerous and clever. I might need a mind like his. The
407,"Sisterhood is up to something. Remember that Old Earth saying, never"
408,trust a Nun? Never trust a Nurse. And never trust a cat. Perfume? 
409,(She tucks the vial down her d�colletage.)
410,
411,[ICU]
412,
413,(A dark place lined with green-lit bulkhead doors.)
414,
415,"JATT: It was having a perfectly normal blood wash, and all of a sudden"
416,it started crying. It's this one. 
417,(They open the door. Someone reaches out to them.) 
418,"MAN: Please, help me. "
419,JATT: Look at its eyes. So alive. 
420,CASP: Positively sparkling. 
421,"MAN: Please, where am I? "
422,CASP: And speech! How can it even have a vocabulary? 
423,JATT: Sister Corvin's written a thesis on the migration of sentience.
424,She calls it The Echo of Life. It's well worth a read. 
425,MAN: Help me. 
426,"CASP: I've seen enough, thank you. "
427,(Jatt closes the door.) 
428,"CASP: If this happens again, we might have to review our brain stem"
429,policy. 
430,JATT: And what should we do with the patient? 
431,CASP: Standard procedure. Incinerate. 
432,"(At the end of the row, Jatt turns a handle. The cell lights up and the"
433,man screams.)
434,
435,[Ward 26]
436,
437,TANNOY: Ambient temperature stands at fourteen
438,degrees. This temperature is designed to promote healing and
439,well-being. 
440,(The Doctor is going round all the cubicles. One has a person floating
441,in midair.) 
442,DOCTOR: There you are. Come and look at this patient. Marconi's
443,Disease. Should take years to recover. Two days. I've never seen
444,anything like it. They've invented a cell washing cascade. It's
445,amazing. Their medical science is way advanced. And this one. 
446,(An man as white as his bed gown.) 
447,"DOCTOR: Pallidome Pancrosis. Kills you in ten minutes, and he's fine. I"
448,need to find a terminal. I've got to see how they do this. Because if
449,"they've got the best medicine in the world, then why is it such a"
450,secret? 
451,CASS-ROSE: I can't Adam and Eve it. 
452,"DOCTOR: What's, what's. what's with the voice? "
453,"CASS-ROSE: Oh, I don't know. Just larking about. New Earth, new me. "
454,"DOCTOR: Well, I can talk. New New Doctor. "
455,"CASS-ROSE: Mmm, aren't you just. "
456,"(Cassandra grabs the Doctor and kisses him, long and hard.) "
457,CASS-ROSE: Terminal's this way. Phew. 
458,"DOCTOR: Yep, still got it. "
459,[Ward 26 waiting room]
460,
461,"(At the computer terminal, by the lift.) "
462,"DOCTOR: Nope, nothing odd. Surgery, post-op, nano-dentistry. No sign of"
463,a shop. They should have a shop. 
464,"CASS-ROSE: No, it's missing something else. When I was downstairs,"
465,those Nurse Cat Nuns were talking about Intensive Care. Where is it? 
466,DOCTOR: You're right. Well done. 
467,CASS-ROSE: Why would they hide a whole department? It's got to be there
468,somewhere. Search the sub-frame. 
469,DOCTOR: What if the sub-frame's locked? 
470,CASS-ROSE: Try the installation protocol. 
471,DOCTOR: Yeah. Of course. Sorry. Hold on. 
472,"(He uses the sonic screwdriver on the interface, and the whole wall"
473,slides down to reveal a corridor.) 
474,DOCTOR: Intensive Care. Certainly looks intensive. 
475,(Their actions are noticed by Novice Hame.)
476,
477,[ICU]
478,
479,(Rose leads the way down a good old-fashioned
480,"staircase. The whole place is lined with the cells, thousands of them,"
481,a bit like the Tomb of the Cybermen. The Doctor opens one at random. It
482,contains a very sick looking man.) 
483,CASS-ROSE: That's disgusting. What's wrong with him? 
484,DOCTOR: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
485,(The Doctor closes the door and moves on to the next. It contains a
486,young woman.) 
487,CASS-ROSE: What disease is that? 
488,DOCTOR: All of them. Every single disease in the galaxy. They've been
489,infected with everything. 
490,CASS-ROSE: What about us? Are we safe? 
491,DOCTOR: The air's sterile. Just don't touch them. 
492,(He closes the door.) 
493,CASS-ROSE: How many patients are there? 
494,DOCTOR: They're not patients. 
495,CASS-ROSE: But they're sick. 
496,DOCTOR: They were born sick. They're meant to be sick. They exist to be
497,sick. Lab rats. No wonder the Sisters have got a cure for everything.
498,They've built the ultimate research laboratory. A human farm. 
499,CASS-ROSE: Why don't they just die? 
500,DOCTOR: Plague carriers. The last to go. 
501,HAME: It's for the greater cause. 
502,"DOCTOR: Novice Hame, When you took your vows, did you agree to this? "
503,HAME: The Sisterhood has sworn to help. 
504,"DOCTOR: What, by killing? "
505,HAME: But they're not real people. They're specially grown. They have
506,no proper existence. 
507,"DOCTOR: What's the turnover, hmm? Thousand a day? Thousand the next?"
508,Thousand the next? How many thousands? For how many years? How many! 
509,HAME: Mankind needed us. They came to this planet with so many
510,illnesses. We couldn't cope. We did try. We tried everything. We tried
511,"using clone-meat and bio-cattle, but the results were too slow, so the"
512,Sisterhood grew its own flesh. That's all they are. Flesh. 
513,DOCTOR: These people are alive. 
514,"HAME: But think of those Humans out there, healthy and happy, because"
515,of us. 
516,"DOCTOR: If they live because of this, then life is worthless. "
517,HAME: But who are you to decide that? 
518,"DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. And if you don't like it, if you want to take"
519,"it to a higher authority, then there isn't one. It stops with me. "
520,CASS-ROSE: Just to confirm. None of the humans in the city actually
521,know about this? 
522,HAME: We thought it best not. 
523,DOCTOR: Hold on. I can understand the bodies. I can understand your
524,vows. One thing I can't understand. What have you done to Rose? 
525,HAME: I don't know what you mean. 
526,"DOCTOR: And I'm being very, very calm. You want to be aware of that."
527,"Very, very calm. And the only reason I'm being so very, very calm is"
528,that the brain is a delicate thing. Whatever you've done to Rose's
529,"head, I want it reversed. "
530,HAME: We haven't done anything. 
531,CASS-ROSE: I'm perfectly fine. 
532,"DOCTOR: These people are dying, and Rose would care. "
533,"CASS-ROSE: Oh, all right, clever clogs. Smarty pants. Lady-killer. "
534,DOCTOR: What's happened to you? 
535,"CASS-ROSE: I knew something was going on in this hospital, but I needed"
536,this body and your mind to find it out. 
537,DOCTOR: Who are you? 
538,CASS-ROSE: The last human. 
539,DOCTOR: Cassandra? 
540,CASS-ROSE: Wake up and smell the perfume. 
541,"(She squirts the vial up his nose, and he passes out.) "
542,HAME: You've hurt him. I don't understand. I'll have to fetch Matron. 
543,"CASS-ROSE: You do that, because I want to see her. Now, run along."
544,Sound the alarm! 
545,(Cassandra pulls on a power cable and sets off the alarms. Hame runs.)
546,
547,[Ward 26 waiting room]
548,
549,"HAME: Matron, it's that man, and the girl. "
550,CASP: We heard the alarm. Now get back to work. Tend to your patients. 
551,[ICU]
552,
553,(The Doctor is inside a cell. Chip has joined his
554,mistress.) 
555,DOCTOR: Let me out! Let me out! 
556,CASS-ROSE: Aren't you lucky there was a spare? Standing room only. 
557,DOCTOR: You've stolen Rose's body. 
558,"CASS-ROSE: Over the years, I've thought of a thousand ways to kill you,"
559,"Doctor. And now, that's exactly what I've got. One thousand diseases."
560,They pump the patients with a top-up every ten minutes. You've got
561,about three minutes left. Enjoy. 
562,"DOCTOR: Just let Rose go, Cassandra. "
563,"CASS-ROSE: I will. As soon as I've found someone younger, and less"
564,"common, then I'll junk her with the waste. Now hushaby. It's showtime. "
565,JATT: Anything we can do to help? 
566,"CASS-ROSE: Straight to the point, Whiskers. I want money. "
567,CASP: The Sisterhood is a charity. We don't give money. We only accept.
568,
569,"CASS-ROSE: The humans across the water pay you a fortune, and that's"
570,"exactly what I need. A one-off payment, that's all I want. Oh, and"
571,"perhaps a yacht. In return for which, I shall tell the city nothing of"
572,your institutional murder. Is that a deal? 
573,CASP: I'm afraid not. 
574,CASS-ROSE: I'd really advise you to think about this. 
575,"CASP: Oh, there's no need. I have to decline. "
576,"CASS-ROSE: I'll tell them, and you've no way of stopping me. You're not"
577,exactly Nuns with Guns. You're not even armed. 
578,CASP: Who needs arms when we have claws? 
579,(Matron unsheathes her claws.) 
580,"CASS-ROSE: Well, nice try. Chip? Plan B. "
581,"(Chip pulls a lever, and all the doors on that level open. The Doctor"
582,"comes out along with a lot of dazed, diseased people.) "
583,DOCTOR: What've you done? 
584,"CASS-ROSE: Gave the system a shot of adrenaline, just to wake them up."
585,See you! 
586,"DOCTOR: Don't touch them! Whatever you do, don't touch! "
587,(The Doctor runs after Cassandra and Chip as the people advance on the
588,cats.) 
589,"MAN: Please, save us. "
590,JATT: I think we should withdraw. 
591,"MAN: We understood what you did to us. As part of the machine, we know"
592,the machine. 
593,CASP: Fascinating. It's actually constructing an argument. 
594,MAN: And we will end it. 
595,(He puts his hand into a socket and get electrocuted. The locks on all
596,"the cell doors blow, freeing the people inside.) "
597,"JATT: They're free. By the Goddess Santori, the flesh is free! "
598,MAN: Stop the pain. 
599,"(A woman touches Sister Jatt and she dies, screaming. On a catwalk"
600,across the way.) 
601,"CASS-ROSE: Oh, my God. "
602,DOCTOR: What the hell have you done? 
603,CASS-ROSE: It wasn't me. 
604,"DOCTOR: One touch and you get every disease in the world, and I want"
605,"that body safe, Cassandra. We've got to go down. "
606,CASS-ROSE: But there's thousands of them! 
607,DOCTOR: Run! Down! Down! Go down! 
608,(Matron gets to a telephone.) 
609,CASP: Quarantine the building!

633,Nothing's moving. 
634,CASS-ROSE: This way! 
635,(She leads the Doctor towards her lair. Chip gets cut off from them as
636,more people approach.) 
637,DOCTOR: Someone will touch him. 
638,CASS-ROSE: Leave him! He's just a clone thing. He's only got a half
639,life. Come on! 
640,CHIP: Mistress! 
641,"DOCTOR: I'm sorry, I can't let her escape. "
642,CHIP: My Mistress!

656,CASS-ROSE: We're trapped! What am I going to do? 
657,"DOCTOR: Well, for starters, you're going to leave that body. That"
658,psychograft is banned on every civilised planet. You're compressing
659,Rose to death. 
660,CASS-ROSE: But I've got nowhere to go. My original skin's dead. 
661,"DOCTOR: Not my problem. You can float as atoms in the air. Now, get"
662,out. Give her back to me. 
663,CASS-ROSE: You asked for it. 
664,(Cassandra take a deep breath and blows energy out to the Doctor.) 
665,"ROSE: Blimey, my head. Where'd she go? "
666,"CASS-DOCTOR: Oh, my. This is different. "
667,ROSE: Cassandra? 
668,"CASS-DOCTOR: Goodness me, I'm a man. Yum. So many parts. And hardly"
669,"used. Oh, oh, two hearts! Oh, baby, I'm beating out a samba! "
670,ROSE: Get out of him. 
671,"CASS-DOCTOR: Oo, he's slim, and a little bit foxy. You've thought so"
672,too. I've been inside your head. You've been looking. You like it. 
673,(The diseased people burst in.) 
674,"CASS-DOCTOR: What do we do? What would he do? The Doctor, what the hell"
675,would he do? 
676,ROSE: Ladder. We've got to get up.

690,(Matron Casp grabs her ankle.) 
691,ROSE: Get off! 
692,CASP: All our good work. All that healing. The good name of the
693,Sisterhood. You have destroyed everything. 
694,CASS-DOCTOR: Go and play with a ball of string. 
695,"CASP: Everywhere, disease. This is the human world. Sickness! "
696,"(A diseased arm reaches up and grasps Casp's ankle. She falls,"

704,CASS-DOCTOR: You mean this thing? 
705,"ROSE: Yes, I mean that thing. "
706,"CASS-DOCTOR: Well, I don't know how. That Doctor's hidden away all his"

708,"ROSE: Cassandra, go back into me. The Doctor can open it. Do it! "
709,CASS-DOCTOR: Hold on tight. 
710,(The energy transfers.)

719,"CASS-DOCTOR: But I can't go into you, he simply refuses. He's so rude. "

742,CLOVIS: Show me your skin. 
743,"DOCTOR: Look, clean. Look, if we'd been touched, we'd be dead. So how's"
744,it going up here? What's the status? 
745,CLOVIS: There's nothing but silence from the other wards. I think we're
746,the only ones left. And I've been trying to override the quarantine. If
747,"I can trip a signal over to New New York, they can send a private"
748,executive squad. 
749,"DOCTOR: You can't do that. If they forced entry, they'd break"
750,quarantine. 
751,CLOVIS: I am not dying in here. 
752,DOCTOR: We can't let a single particle of disease get out. There is ten
753,"million people in that city. They'd all be at risk. Now, turn that off!"
754,
755,CLOVIS: Not if it gets me out.

865,FACE OF BOE : There are better things to do today. Dying can wait. 
866,"CASS-ROSE: Oh, I hate telepathy. Just what I need, a head full of big"
867,face. 
868,DOCTOR: Shh! 
869,"FACE OF BOE : I have grown tired with the universe, Doctor, but you"
870,have taught me to look at it anew. 
871,"DOCTOR: There are legends, you know, saying that you're millions of"
872,years old. 
873,FACE OF BOE : There are? That would be impossible. 
874,DOCTOR: Wouldn't it just. I got the impression there was something you
875,wanted to tell me. 
876,FACE OF BOE : A great secret. 
877,DOCTOR: So the legend says. 
878,FACE OF BOE : It can wait.

907,fair. I can take you to the city. They can build you a skin tank and
908,you can stand trial for what you've done. 
909,"CASS-CHIP: Well, that would be rather dramatic. Possibly my finest"
910,"hour, and certainly my finest hat, but I'm afraid we don't have time."

918,"place for Chip and me any more. You're right, Doctor. It's time to die,"
