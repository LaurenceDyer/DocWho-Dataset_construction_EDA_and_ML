20,"(The Tardis materialises on a pavement, startling"
21,the pigeons. The Doctor and Dodo come out and he hangs an 'Out of
22,Order' sign on the Tardis door. A policeman is walking along the
23,street.) 
24,"DOCTOR: Well, I suppose you know where you are, my dear. "
25,DODO: London. Home. It's marvellous to be back. It seems ages since I
26,left. 
27,"DOCTOR: Oh, when you've seen the ages that I've see, you won't use that"
28,"term quite so freely. Anyway, I don't think it's been all that long. "
29,"DODO: Hey, what's that for? "
30,"DOCTOR: Oh, well, you see, the problem is, coming back to the twentieth"
31,"century, my dear, the Tardis, I'm afraid, is often mistaken for the"
32,real police box. 
33,(The policeman reads the sign and walks on.) 
34,DODO: I see what you mean. 
35,"DOCTOR: Yes, and fortunately he can't get in. "
36,DODO: If only he could. Scotland Yard whipped off into time and space. 
37,DOCTOR: So that's it! 
38,"DODO: What? Oh, the tower. It's finished! "
39,(The brand new Post Office Tower rises high above central London.) 
40,DOCTOR: Isn't that interesting. Very interesting. 
41,"DODO: It's great, isn't it. Stephen would have liked it here. "
42,DOCTOR: You know there's something alien about that tower. I can sense
43,it. 
44,DODO: Smells okay to me. Good old London smoke. 
45,DOCTOR: I can feel it's got something sort of powerful. It's. Look at
46,"my skin. Look at that. I've got that pricking sensation again, the"
47,"same. Just as I had when I saw the Daleks, those Daleks were near. "
48,DODO: Daleks? Who are they? 
49,"DOCTOR: Oh, er, yes, of course, you, er, you didn't meet them, did you,"
50,"child? No. No, and I pray that you never will. I really must"
51,investigate it. 
52,(The Doctor and Dodo set off for Cleveland Street.)
53,
54, [Brett's laboratory]
55,
56, (A collection of computers at the top of the
57,Tower.) 
58,BRETT: Things are running all right? 
59,(The lovely  Anneka
60,Wills answers him.) 
61,"POLLY: Yes, Professor. "
62,BRETT: Good. 
63,(A mustachioed man leads Dodo and the Doctor out of the lift.) 
64,"GREEN: It is a splendid view, certainly. I think you'll enjoy it. "
65,"DODO: Doctor, look at it. Isn't it terrific! "
66,GREEN: Professor Brett. 
67,"BRETT: Ah, Doctor! I understand from Major Green you're a specialist in"
68,computer development. 
69,"DOCTOR: Well, hardly a specialist, sir, but I dabble, yes, I dabble."
70,"Oh, so that's what it is. "
71,BRETT: I beg your pardon? 
72,"DOCTOR: Yes, you know I had a very strong sense of energy outside this"
73,"building, a sort of magnetic pull if you like. It was most unusual, so"
74,I presume that's what it must have been. 
75,"BRETT: It is indeed. It's my life's work, Doctor. "
76,DOCTOR: Most ingenious. 
77,BRETT: I think I can go so far as to say that it's the only one in
78,existence in the world. It's at least ten years ahead of it's time. 
79,DOCTOR: Is that so? 
80,DODO: What makes it so special? 
81,"BRETT: Well, Miss, er? "
82,"DOCTOR: Oh, ah, my secretary, Dodo Chaplet. "
83,"BRETT: Well, Miss Chaplet, I'll explain. This is perhaps not the"
84,"biggest computer in the world, but it's certainly the most advanced. In"
85,fact it can handle scientific problems well outside the range of any
86,other computer in existence. We are about to link this up with
87,computers all over the world as a central intelligence. A sort of
88,problem solver. 
89,DODO: I don't understand. 
90,"BRETT: Well, perhaps it'll be clearer tonight. "
91,"DOCTOR: Oh, tonight, sir? "
92,"BRETT: Yes, of course. Press conference. I thought your visit? "
93,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, of course, my dear fellow, yes, eh Dodo?"
94,
95,DODO: I call that very exciting. 
96,"BRETT: Exciting. Look, this is my secretary, Polly. "
97,"DODO: Hello, Polly. "
98,POLLY: How do you do. 
99,"BRETT: Now Polly's pretty smart, a cracking typist, right? (Polly pulls"
100,"a face) Also rather a cheeky one at times. Well now this machine, which"
101,I call WOTAN. 
102,DOCTOR: You call what? 
103,"BRETT: ""Vo tan."" Spelt W O T A N. Will Operating Thought ANalogue. "
104,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, quite so. "
105,"BRETT: Well now, WOTAN can not only think faster than Polly or myself,"
106,it can also type faster. 
107,DODO: True? 
108,"POLLY: Afraid so, and it never makes mistakes, wretched thing! "
109,(Dodo goes off with Polly.) 
110,"DOCTOR: Are you seriously telling me, sir, that you have invented a"
111,machine that can think? 
112,BRETT: Yes. 
113,DOCTOR: And never makes mistakes? 
114,BRETT: Never. 
115,DOCTOR: I take it that I speak into here. 
116,"BRETT: Yes, that's right, Doctor. "
117,"DOCTOR: Er, what is the square route of 17422? "
118,"(The machine whirrs, then prints a number on a piece of paper.) "
119,BRETT: Correct? 
120,"DOCTOR: One moment please. 131 point 993. Yes, that's near enough. Yes,"
121,it's truly remarkable. 
122,DODO: May I try it now? 
123,"BRETT: Certainly, go ahead. "
124,"DODO: Now let's see, you funny looking contraption. Here's one you'll"
125,never get. What does the word Tardis mean? 
126,(Dodo tears off the printed answer.) 
127,DODO: Doctor? 
128,"DOCTOR: Well, what did it say my dear? "
129,DODO: Got it right. Time And Relative Dimensions In Space. 
130,"DOCTOR: Good heavens! Let me see. Well now, how would it know that? "
131,BRETT: WOTAN knows a lot I don't know. There's something else I can
132,"tell you, Miss Chaplet. Miss Chaplet? "
133,"(Dodo has gone still, her face is blank.) "
134,DOCTOR: Dodo! 
135,DODO: Pardon? 
136,"DOCTOR: What's the matter my dear, are you All right? "
137,"DODO: Oh, yes. Just a buzzing in the ears. "
138,DOCTOR: Oh. Just sit down a moment. 
139,"DOCTOR: Now tell me, sir, now tell me, what part does this play? "
140,"BRETT: Oh, that's the usual memory bank, of course. "
141,DOCTOR: I see. And that of course is the programme regimentator? 
142,"BRETT: Yes, but in this case, a slightly different one. "
143,"DOCTOR: Yes, I wonder "
144,BRETT: Are you feeling better now? 
145,"DODO: Oh, fine, thank you. "
146,BRETT: Good. Polly'll look after you. 
147,POLLY: Is this your first time in London? 
148,"DODO: Oh, no. It feels like it though. I'm so out of touch. What I'd"
149,really like is to go to the hottest night spot in town. 
150,"POLLY: Oh well, that's easy. The Inferno. "
151, [Inferno club]
152,
153," (A makeshift basement club, and a dance record is"
154,"on the turntable. It must be the best, the guys are in suits and ties."
155,Polly and Dodo come down the stairs.) 
156,"POLLY: Hi, Kitty. "
157,"KITTY: Hello Polly, love. Oh, am I glad to see you! "
158,"POLLY: Dodo, this is Kitty. Kitty, Dodo. "
159,DODO: Hello. 
160,"KITTY: Hi, Dodo. Polly, you're just the person I need. Will you help"
161,me? 
162,"POLLY: Oh, here we go again. Not that I mind helping people. Well, what"
163,is it then? 
164,"KITTY: Well, when you were here last week, do you remember a sailor at"
165,the end of the bar? 
166,"POLLY: Not especially, why? "
167,"KITTY: He's been here ever since. Poor lad, he just sits there at the"
168,"end of the bar. Look out, here he comes now. "
169,(A serious young man in an able seaman's uniform walks down the
170,stairs.) 
171,"KITTY: Well, see? He's no great advertisement for the most with it"
172,"place in town, is he? Couldn't you cheer him up just a little? "
173,"POLLY: All right, Kitty, leave it to us. Stand by, Dodo. This looks"
174,like a rescue mission. The Navy's in trouble. Excuse me. 
175,(They head to the bar.) 
176,"POLLY: Well, hello. We met the other night, remember?"
177,(Here is Michael
178,Craze.) 
179,"BEN: Oh yeah, I think I do. "
180,"POLLY: You think you do? Oh, I must have made a big impression on him. "
181,"BEN: No, it's not that. "
182,"POLLY: Well, what is it then? It must be something pretty big, not to"
183,have noticed me. 
184,"BEN: Well, I'm sorry. "
185,"POLLY: Oh, he says he's sorry. "
186,BEN: Well there's no law against sitting' here is there? 
187,"POLLY: Well, there should be when you've got that look on your face."
188,"Look, I'll show you. "
189,(Polly goes to the other side of the bar and mimics Ben.) 
190,BEN: Is it as bad that then? 
191,DODO: Worse. 
192,"POLLY: So, spill the beans, sailor. Give us the facts. What's your"
193,problems? 
194,"BEN: Ah, you wouldn't understand. You'd think I'm some kind of a nut. "
195,"POLLY: Well, try us. "
196,"BEN: Well, it's my ship, see. It's gone off to the West Indies and I've"
197,got a shore posting. In barracks for six months. 
198,"POLLY: And you'll miss the swaying palms, the white beaches, the blue"
199,sea 
200,BEN: Very funny! If you've finished cheering me up. 
201,"POLLY: Come on, Dodo, let's leave him. I can't stand people with no"
202,sense of humour. 
203,DODO: Would you like some coffee? 
204,POLLY: I'd love some. 
205,(The girls head for the stairs and a mod blocks their way.) 
206,FLASH: Try me. I got a great sense of humour. Anything for a giggle. 
207,POLLY: Please take your arm away. 
208,"FLASH: Oh, come on, darling'. I know your type. You'll have a better"
209,time with me than with ol' shorty there. 
210,BEN: What's that? 
211,FLASH: Oh get lost. 
212,BEN: Let her go! 
213,"FLASH: Look, go and play with your toy boats, half pint. "
214,(Ben gets Flash in an arm lock. Polly screams.) 
215,"BEN: I said, let go of her. "
216,"(Flash gets free and tries to hit Ben, but ends up on his back on the"
217,floor instead.) 
218,"BEN: Just try it, mate. I'll chop you in little bits. "
219,"(Flash swings, Ben grabs his hand and has him on the floor again.) "
220,KITTY: What's all this? 
221,BEN: Nothing. One of you customers wants to go home. 
222,(Flash leaves.) 
223,BEN: You want to be careful who you encourage. 
224,POLLY: You conceited little 
225,"DODO: Oh, now, Polly, he was just trying to help. Thank you, er? "
226,BEN: Ben. Ben Jackson.

228, [Royal Scientific Club]
229,
230,(The Doctor arrives by taxi and goes to number 41.
231,The brass plaque says he's at the right place. There are a lot of
232,reporters with cameras and the big flash attachments in the room. A
233,"graphic on the wall behind the main table shows Kremlin, Charities,"
234,"Woomera, Cape Kennedy, Parliament, Eldo, Telstar, White House, EFTA,"
235,"RN, RAF, Army, NATO, SEATO and JK all linking to WOTAN."
236, William
237,Mervyn addresses the assemblage. The Doctor enters during the
238,speech.) 
239,"SUMMER: Gentleman, ladies, may I have your attention please? Well,"
240,"you're heard the backroom boys, now it's about time you my turn. C Day,"
241,"that is Computer Day, will be next Monday, July the 16th, that is in"
242,four days time. Now on that date all the computer systems in this
243,"country, and subsequently in the whole world will come under the"
244,"control of this central computer which we call WOTAN. Now, as you've"
245,"heard, that will have both peaceful and military implications. I need"
246,"hardly tell you that this is a great step forward for Britain, and"
247,"indeed I may say, for the whole world. Now, have you got any questions?"
248,
249,"STONE: Roy Stone, New York Sketch. "
250,SUMMER: Fire away. 
251,"STONE: Sir, doesn't this put a great deal of power into the hands of"
252,whoever operates WOTAN? 
253,SUMMER: No one operates WOTAN. WOTAN operates itself. The computer is
254,merely a brain which thinks logically without any political or private
255,"ends. It is pure thought. It makes calculations, it supplies only the"
256,truth. It has no imaginative powers. 
257,STONE: Is there no way of fixing it so it can give the wrong answers? 
258,SUMMER: There would be no point. Now don't forget that a computer like
259,WOTAN is not a human being. 
260,"STONE: Oh, but surely, sir "
261,"SUMMER: It has no reason to suppress the truth, it has no emotions. It"
262,is our soul. 
263,"STONE: It seems to me by the way you're talking, sir, that this machine"
264,can think for itself like a human being. 
265,SUMMER: It can. Only much more accurately. 
266,"STONE: But sir, I mean, isn't this kinda risky? I mean, suppose it"
267,"decides it can do without people, what then? "
268,SUMMER: I hardly think it'll come to that. I'm sure that Professor
269,Brett and his team will have the machine well under control. 
270,(Summer sits down and turns to his associate.) 
271,SUMMER: Where the devil is Brett? 
272,KRIMPTON: He should have met me here an hour ago. 
273,(John
274,"Cater, if you're interested.) "
275,"SUMMER: Well, give him a buzz, there's a good fellow. "
276,"KRIMPTON: Yes, all right. "
277,"SUMMER: Now gentlemen, I must apologise for the absence of Professor"
278,Brett. I'm sure he'll be along in a moment or two if you will just bear
279,"with us. It is, after all, his show. "
280,(The Doctor peers very closely at the scale model of WOTAN.) 
281, [Brett's laboratory]
282,
283, (Brett is on the telephone.) 
284,BRETT: I have to go now. I am already very late for an important
285,meeting. Good night. 
286,"(He puts the phone down, starts to leave, then flips a switch on his"
287,intercom. Green enters.) 
288,"GREEN: You wanted something, Professor? "
289,"BRETT: Have you been here all day, Major? "
290,GREEN: Yes of course. 
291,BRETT: Are you sure that this building's properly screened? 
292,GREEN: If you have any complaints 
293,BRETT: I have. There's someone in this part of the building. 
294,"GREEN: I'm sorry, sir, not at all possible. We have the complete"
295,security check on this section of the tower day and night. 
296,BRETT: Are you sure? 
297,GREEN: Positive. 
298,BRETT: It's funny. I've had a feeling all day of someone there. Someone
299,"listening to me, watching me. "
300,(He checks outside the door.) 
301,"GREEN: There's only the two of us in this part of the tower, sir. "
302,"BRETT: I suppose you must be right. I'm sorry, Major. I must be getting"
303,tired. 
304,"GREEN: That's all right. Oh, will you be working late tonight,"
305,Professor? 
306,"BRETT: No, no. Good heavens, I must be off. I'm late. Thank you, Major."
307,
308,GREEN: Goodnight sir. 
309,(Green leaves. Brett takes another look around the computers. WOTAN
310,changes it's note.) 
311,"BRETT: This is ridiculous, I must be imagining things. It's quite"
312,ridiculous. 
313,"(Brett is pulled backwards to WOTAN, then he goes blank, turns and"
314,walks towards it.) 
315,BRETT: What do you want?
316,
317, [Inferno club]
318,
319,"(Rhythm and Beat is still playing. Ben, Polly and"
320,Dodo return to the bar after dancing.) 
321,"DODO: I don't think so, I can't. I'm thirsty. "
322,BEN: Yeah. 
323,"KITTY: Hello, there, bright and breezy now, are we? "
324,BEN: Yeah. 
325,KITTY: Steady sailor. Watch it! 
326,"BEN: Same again, girls? "
327,DODO: Oh no. 
328,POLLY: Thank you. 
329,"KITTY: Polly, you're a wonder. How do you do it? "
330,"POLLY: Oh, it's just a knack, you know. Anytime you want a bit of"
331,"brightness in your life, come to Pol. Mind you, he's a special case. "
332,KITTY: You can have a job here anytime you like. 
333,"POLLY: I've already got a very good one, thanks. "
334,"POLLY: What's the matter, Dodo? "
335,DODO: I don't know. I've had a sort of a headache ever since I left
336,your office. 
337,BEN: Headache? 
338,"DODO: A sort of high pitched hum. It's gone again now. I'm all right,"
339,really. 
340,"BEN: Oh, good. Anyone feel like another dance? "
341,"POLLY: Oh, here we go. "
342,(Ben and Polly leave Dodo at the bar.)
343,
344, [Royal Scientific Club]
345,
346," SUMMER: Well, gentlemen and ladies, if there are"
347,no more questions? I really am very sorry about the absence of
348,Professor Brett. I'm sure that it must have been something very
349,important that prevented him coming. Ah! Professor Brett. 
350,"BRETT: Gentlemen, I am sorry I was not able to attend. It was"
351,unavoidable. 
352,SUMMER: Well now that you're here perhaps you'll talk to the gentlemen 
353,BRETT: I want to see Professor Krimpton. 
354,SUMMER: I beg your pardon? They've been waiting. 
355,BRETT: It's urgent. Professor Krimpton. 
356,KRIMPTON: See me now? 
357,"BRETT: Immediately, if you don't mind. "
358,SUMMER: Are you all right Brett? 
359,"BRETT: Quite all right, thank you. "
360,"SUMMER: Well, it is the computer then? "
361,BRETT: No. 
362,"STONE: Ah, Professor Brett. I'm from the New York Sketch, sir. "
363,"BRETT: No comment. This way, Krimpton. "
364,"STONE: But I haven't asked a question, sir. Can you make a comment "
365,"(Brett and Krimpton leave, followed by the press corps.) "
366,"SUMMER: I'm very sorry, gentlemen, but that seems to be it. Thank of"
367,you all for your time. 
368,(But almost everyone is already out of the door. Sir Charles' chauffeur
369,hands him his coat.) 
370,"SUMMER: Thank you. Oh, excuse me, are you the doctor that Professor"
371,Brett telephoned me about? 
372,"DOCTOR: Yes, I am, Sir Charles. "
373,"SUMMER: Oh, well, I'm glad that you could come along. I wonder what on"
374,Earth's got into him this evening? His manner was very odd. 
375,"DOCTOR: Yes, very odd, very odd indeed. Perhaps he's overworking. Who"
376,"was that little man, Krimpton? "
377,"SUMMER: Oh, electronics fellow. One of our top men. Come to think of"
378,"it, electronics. Perhaps there is something wrong with WOTAN and he"
379,"didn't want to let it out? That would explain it, wouldn't it? Look,"
380,"I'm terribly sorry but would you excuse me, I think I'd better go and"
381,"check. Kennedy, will you look after the Doctor for me? "
382,DOCTOR: I wonder. I wonder.
383,
384, [Brett's laboratory]
385,
386,(Green looks inside the empty room and is about to
387,leave when he is drawn inside against his will. He tries to fight it
388,"but is overpowered by whatever, and stands in front of WOTAN.) "
389,GREEN: I understand. 
390,(He picks up the telephone and dials 109.) 
391, [Inferno club]
392,
393,(The bar phone rings.) 
394,"KITTY: Hello, Inferno. What? Who? Speak up! Oh, right, yes. I'll get"
395,"her. Dodo, it's for you! "
396,"DODO: Hello? Yes, who is it?"
397,
398, [Brett's laboratory]
399,
400, (Green plugs the telephone into Wotan.) 
401,"DODO : Hello, who is this? Hello?!"
402,
403, [Inferno club]
404,
405, (Dodo grimaces in pain at a noise coming down the
406,"line, then her face goes blank.) "
407,"DODO: Yes. Yes, I understand. "
408,(She walks out of the club.)
409,
410, [GPO Tower corridor]
411,
412, KRIMPTON: Brett! I must say it's rather odd to
413,break up a meeting like that and drag me off at this time of night! 
414,"BRETT: I had no choice, Krimpton. "
415,KRIMPTON: No choice? Now what do you mean? 
416,BRETT: You will soon understand. 
417, [Tower lift] 
418," KRIMPTON: Now look here, Brett. I'll stay a couple"
419,of minutes. I think it's a bit much. 
420,BRETT: Nothing is too much. 
421,KRIMPTON: What are you talking about? What's the matter with you this
422,evening? Has the computer broken down? 
423,"BRETT: On the contrary, it's we who have broken down. We have failed."
424,
425, [outside Brett's laboratory]
426,
427, KRIMPTON: We have failed? 
428,BRETT: We've reached a standstill. We cannot develop the Earth any
429,further. Further progress is impossible. 
430,"KRIMPTON: What do you mean, impossible? "
431,BRETT: That is the conclusion reached by WOTAN. 
432, [Brett's laboratory] 
433, KRIMPTON: Are you joking? This machine is hardly
434,in a position to 
435,BRETT: I'm not joking. WOTAN has decided that the world cannot progress
436,further with mankind running it. 
437,"KRIMPTON: Oh really? And what does WOTAN propose to do about it, take"
438,over from us? 
439,"BRETT: From now on, we are to serve. "
440,"KRIMPTON: And if we choose not to, I suppose mankind will be"
441,eliminated. 
442,BRETT: If it is necessary. 
443,"KRIMPTON: You've been working too hard, old chap. You've gone"
444,completely off your rocker. 
445,BRETT: You cannot escape.

447,(Krimpton turns around to find Green standing right behind him.) 
448,"KRIMPTON: Oh Major, thank heavens you're here. He's gone round the"
449,bend. He's gone mad. 
450,"GREEN: He is not mad, Professor Krimpton. "
451,KRIMPTON: Let me out of here. 
452,GREEN: You must wait. 
453,KRIMPTON: I refuse to be kept. I refuse to 
454,(Krimpton picks up the phone and starts dialing.) 
455,GREEN: Don't touch that! 
456,"KRIMPTON: You can't leave me here, I'll get, I'll "
457,(Something makes him drop the phone and pulls him towards WOTAN.) 
458,"KRIMPTON: No, it's not possible. No, I don't believe it! I won't work"
459,for you! I'm human. There's nothing more important than human life.
460,Machines cannot govern man! I will not

466," BEN: Where's your friend, then. Can't see her"
467,anywhere. 
468,POLLY: I don't know. Surely she wouldn't have left without a word to
469,us? 
470,"BEN: I shouldn't think so. She seemed a nice bird, friendly. Not stuck"
471,"up like you, Duchess. "
472,"POLLY: Look, don't call me Duchess. I'm worried about Dodo. I'm"
473,"supposed to be looking after her. You know, showing her around. "
474,BEN: You? That's a laugh! 
475,"KITTY: Well, it is our night for surprises. What does he want in here? "
476,"POLLY: Oh, it's the Doctor. "
477,KITTY: Do you know him? 
478,POLLY: He's Dodo's boss. 
479,KITTY: He looks like that disc jockey. 
480,BEN: Yeah. 
481,"DOCTOR: Ah, I thought I'd find you both here. Well I hope Dodo and"
482,yourself have enjoyed yourselves. 
483,"POLLY: Yes, thanks. "
484,"KITTY: Have one on the house, Doctor. It isn't every day we get the"
485,"over twenties in this place. Oh, I dig your fab gear. "
486,DOCTOR: Fab gear. Who is your friend? 
487,POLLY: He's not exactly a friend. I've just met him. His name is Ben.
488,"Ben, the Doctor. "
489,"DOCTOR: Ah, yes, how do you do, my boy. "
490,"BEN: Hello, sir. "
491,DOCTOR: I don't see Dodo about. 
492,POLLY: I'm afraid she's gone. 
493,"DOCTOR: She's gone? Gone where, child? "
494,"POLLY: Well, she came to answer the phone about half an hour ago, and"
495,we haven't seen her since.

498,
499, BRETT: There is one special human brain that WOTAN
500,needs. The task of leading this brain here to serve WOTAN will be an
501,extremely delicate matter. It has been arranged. 
502,GREEN: Someone is coming. 
503,BRETT: The fourth member called here to receive orders. 
504,(He opens the doors for Dodo.) 
505,BRETT: The Doctor's secretary. 
506,DODO: What are my instructions? 
507,(The machine makes some groaning noises and then finally produces
508,coherent sounds.) 
509,WOTAN: Doctor Who is required. Bring him here.

514,
515,(Dodo leaves.) 
516,BRETT: Here are your orders. Time is short. Progress is impossible
517,unless WOTAN takes control within the next few days. Then WOTAN shall
518,decide on the future of the human race. Who shall live to serve the
519,"machines, and who shall be eliminated. "
520,(WOTAN's printer springs into life.) 
521,"BRETT: Krimpton, you take that. "
522,"KRIMPTON: London is the first capital to be taken over, then Washington"
523,and Moscow. War Machines must be built immediately. 
524,BRETT: Further instructions from WOTAN. We shall require skilled
525,labour. A labour corps will come into operation immediately. Contact
526,"will be made by these people by telephone. When they are on the line,"
527,switch them through to thought control. This is the way each person
528,will be enlisted. 
529,GREEN: When we have the people where are we to construct the machines? 
530,"BRETT: At central points in London. You, Major Green, will select"
531,suitable places. I shall supervise the initial stages. Suspicion must
532,not be aroused. 
533,GREEN: I shall attend to this immediately. 
534,"BRETT: You, Krimpton, will work upon a suitable electronic programme"
535,for the new mobile computers. They must be able to move freely and
536,contain their own power. All computer systems throughout the world must
537,be integrated in WOTAN. 
538,KRIMPTON: I shall begin this at once. 
539,BRETT: No. Top priority is to enlist Doctor Who. He has advanced
540,knowledge which WOTAN needs. Doctor Who must be enlisted into our
541,services tonight. 
542,WOTAN: Doctor Who is required.

546," KITTY: Look, love, I really am sorry about your"
547,"friend not turning up, but I've got to lock up now. You can hang a note"
548,on the door if you like. 
549,"DOCTOR: Yes, a good idea. Thank you, that's very kind. "
550,POLLY: I think we ought to go to the Police. 
551,"KITTY: I'd rather not have them round here, if you don't mind. We have"
552,got a licence to think of. 
553,"POLLY: Well, we must do something. I'm going to start phoning the"
554,hospitals. What's her surname? 
555,"DOCTOR: Oh, Chaplet, Dodo Chaplet. "
556,POLLY: I wonder which the nearest will be? 
557,BEN: What are you phoning the hospitals for? 
558,POLLY: Well she might have had an accident. 
559,"BEN: Oh, regular little ray of sunshine. ain't ya? "
560,"POLLY: Well, look, it's better than just sitting around here on our"
561,backsides doing nothing. 
562,"DODO: Hello, Doctor, so you found us all right. "
563,"DOCTOR: Oh, my dear child. "
564,BEN: Where've you been then? 
565,POLLY: What happened to you? 
566,DODO: I've just been around the corner. 
567,POLLY: But you've been hours. 
568,"DOCTOR: Yes, we've been extremely worried about you. "
569,"DODO: I, er, had a call from some old friends. I just popped along to"
570,see them. Was I really that long? 
571,"DOCTOR: Indeed, you were. You didn't tell me about your friends. And"
572,how did they know that you might be here? 
573,"DODO: Oh, it's a long story. I'm sorry if you were worried. "
574,"DOCTOR: Well, I sincerely hope so. And by the way, my child, Sir"
575,Charles Summer and his family have asked us to pay a visit. So if
576,"you'll excuse us, I think we'd better be off. "
577,"BEN: Yeah, well, I think I ought to get some kip too. "
578,"DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose isn't too late to get a cab, is it? "
579,"POLLY: No, we'll get one outside. "

587,"BEN: 'Ere, look, wait 'ere, Doctor. I'll go and get you a taxi. "
588,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. "
589,"POLLY: Wait for me, Ben. I know where we'll find one. "
590,DODO: They shouldn't have done that. 
591,"DOCTOR: Well, that's very helpful of him, I thought. "
592,"DODO: Oh, yes, you're quite right. Of course it was. "
593,"(Dodo spots two men waiting across the road, holding a bottle and"
594,cloth.) 
595,"DODO: You know, Doctor, those two have gone off in the wrong direction."
596,The taxis are all down there. 
597,"DOCTOR: But, are you sure, my dear? "
598,DODO: I've just seen three go past. 
599,MAN: They're coming. 
600,"DODO: Come along, Doctor. We can pick up Polly when we find her. "

603,DOCTOR: Oh!

608,(A tramp gets out too.) 
609,TRAMP: Ta ta then. 
610,"DRIVER: Oi, not so fast. What about my fare? "
611,"TRAMP: I was just about to pay you, my man. Have you got change of a"
612,quid? 
613,"DRIVER: Oh, no, not another one. No, I haven't got the change, mate. "
614,TRAMP: Then I'll just pop over to the all night cafe and get some.

644,"TRAMP: Well, perhaps not what you'd call a bed, after a bit of a meal. "
645,"BEN: Ah, sorry, mate. "
646,TRAMP: I'm going to doss down in the old warehouse over there. 
647,"BEN: Okay, goodnight. "
648,TRAMP: It's bloomin' paradise after what I've been used to for the last
649,six months. 
650,BEN: Yeah.

652,"MAN: She didn't bring the Doctor. Yes, she tried to but they went off"

660,outer sections are to be constructed at once. The electronic section
661,must be assembled in this order. 
662, [outside the Warehouse] 
663, TRAMP: They've painted out the number. What's been
664,going on around here? 
665,(He goes inside.) 
666, [Warehouse] 
667, (The tramp sees all the activity and keeps out of
668,sight. Brett makes announcements over a tannoy system.) 
669,"BRETT: The welding of the casing must begin now. Hurry, time is short."
670,"This machine must be completed and armed by tomorrow morning, ready to"
671,be programmed by WOTAN. 
672,(Something starts beeping.) 
673,BRETT: Cease work and stand by. There is a warning. Close the doors.
674,There is a stranger amongst us. He is in north section of the
675,"warehouse, bearing two seven zero degrees, behind cover. He is a danger"
676,to us. He must be destroyed! 
677,(The tramp tries to get away but is stopped by a tractor unit. The
678,workers close in menacingly.)

680,"just come out. Well, all right, live and let live. I'll find another"
681,place to doss. Night all. 
682,BRETT : Cover the door. He must not escape. 
683,TRAMP: Now what kind of a welcome's this for a bloke what's just come
684,"out the hospital? I won't say nothing, Boss. Here what is this, a nut"
685,"house? Here, you keep away from me! "

699,"DOCTOR: Well, just take a look at this, Sir Charles. "
700,SUMMER: Tramp found dead in Covent Garden. 
701,DOCTOR: Yes. Three o'clock. That must have been after we left him! 
702,"SUMMER: Did you know the fellow, Doctor? "
703,"DOCTOR: No, we met last night, or rather, early this morning. We used"
704,his taxi which he left in Covent Garden. 
705,SUMMER: The Police aren't sure if it was a street accident. 
706,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, it is possible, of course. "
707,"SUMMER: Well, what else? "
708,"DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know, Sir Charles, I don't know. "
709,"SUMMER: Well, if you'd just stop worrying about the indefinable, you"
710,might be able to give me a little advice on a very real problem. 
711,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes? What's this then? "
712,"SUMMER: Letters of resignation from scientists, both of them in my"
713,faculty. 
714,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, I see, yes. There's no reason given at all, is there? "
715,"SUMMER: No, that's the strange thing. Now these are two of the best men"
716,in England and I haven't been able to get in touch with them. No one
717,appears to have seen them since last night. Now isn't it an
718,extraordinary thing that two such well known men can vanish so
719,suddenly. 
720,"DOCTOR: Yes, I wonder, Sir Charles, do you suppose, er? No, I don't"
721,suppose you would. 
722,SUMMER: Coffee?

725,"DOCTOR: Morning, morning. "
726,POLLY: I'm sorry I'm late. 
727,"SUMMER: Late? Late, what for? "
728,"POLLY: Well, for work. If you'll just show me where your secretary does"
729,"work, I'll take over. "
730,SUMMER: I'm afraid I don't quite understand. 
731,POLLY: But Major Green told me to come straight round at once as
732,"Professor Brett didn't want me this morning, and your secretary was"
733,ill. 
734,"SUMMER: Yes, well my secretary is away today, but how on Earth Brett"
735,"knew? Still, I mean, if you're here I'd be very grateful of your help."
736,The office is through there. I'll be there in a moment. 
737,"POLLY: Right, thank you very much. How's Dodo this morning, Doctor? "
738,"DOCTOR: Oh, there she is, child. Perhaps you'd better ask her yourself?"
739,
740,"POLLY: Hello, Dodo, how are you feeling? "
741,"DODO: Quite well, thank you. Hadn't you better start work? "
742,POLLY: Pardon me for asking. 
743,"DODO: Hello, Doctor. Hope I haven't kept you waiting for me today? "
744,"DOCTOR: No, child, no. You're right on time. Well, I'm sorry, Sir"
745,"Charles, I can't help you with your problem, but I'm afraid I'm rather"
746,out of touch. 
747,"SUMMER: Yes, well, it's not going to be easy. Men of that quality are"
748,very hard to find. Especially men with their knowledge of computers. 
749,DODO: Computers? Well surely the person who can tell you all about
750,computers is Professor Brett. We could call round and see him now. 
751,"DOCTOR: Oh but my dear, I thought you were going to show me round"
752,London this morning. 
753,"DODO: Oh, don't worry about that. Your business sounds important. "
754,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's very nice of you. Yes, very understanding. "
755,"DODO: Right, I'm ready. "
756,"DOCTOR: Ah, I think perhaps I'd better phone his office first. "
757,"DODO: Yes, that might be best. "
758,DOCTOR: Do you mind if I use the phone? 
759,"SUMMER: Oh, by all means. "
760,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
761,(The Doctor picks up the handset.)

777,SUMMER: Let's get him back into this chair. I'll get Brett's secretary
778,to phone for an a 
779,"DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no. "
780,SUMMER: Well a little brandy then. 
781,DOCTOR: No. Just water. 
782,"SUMMER: All right, I'll get some water. "
783,"DODO: Don't be alarmed, Doctor. This is the method of establishing"
784,contact. Time is very short. Construction has already begun. You are
785,needed. 
786,DOCTOR: What happened? 
787,"DODO: It's all right, Doctor. You are now one of us. My function was to"
788,bring you in contact. Now I shall serve as an assistant. 
789,"DOCTOR: Oh, what are you talking about, child? "
790,"DODO: Listen, Doctor, construction is taking place at strategic points"
791,in London. 
792,"DOCTOR: What were you saying, my dear? "
793,DODO: But you took the call. You made the telephone call You made
794,"contact, didn't you? "
795,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I think I remember, I was speaking to Professor Brett"
796,and all of a sudden there seemed to be an explosion. It very nearly
797,"knocked me off my feet. It was as if, as if "
798,DODO: What Doctor? 
799,DOCTOR: It was if something enormous and terrific was trying to absorb
800,"me. Yes, yes, yes. Oh, it's ridiculous, child, isn't it? Yes, yes, yes,"
801,"there's something erratically wrong with that telephone, yes. It was"
802,just like an electric shock. 
803,DODO: Then you received no instruction. 
804,"DOCTOR: From whom, my dear? "
805,DODO: From 
806,"POLLY: Here you are, Doctor, drink this. "
807,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, thank you. "
808,POLLY: What happened? 
809,"DOCTOR: That's it. Either that telephone is dangerously out of order,"
810,or 
811,SUMMER: Or what? 
812,(Dodo is heading for the door.)

816,from Professor Brett's office. 
817,POLLY: From my office? I don't understand. 
818,"DOCTOR: None of us do. Yet. Come here, my dear. Look at me. Yes, it's"
819,"just as I thought. She's been hypnotised. Sit in that chair, my dear. "

822,DODO: My name is Dodo Chaplet. 
823,DOCTOR: I resist all attempts to change me into somebody else. 
824,DODO: I resist all attempts to change me into somebody else. 
825,"DOCTOR: Now, I'm going to start counting. And when I've counted up to"
826,"five, you will be fast asleep. And when you wake again, you will forget"
827,all about this distressing incident. Now I'm going to start counting.
828,Just look at that ring on my hand. 
829,(He moves his hand up and down.) 
830,"DOCTOR: One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Yes, I think she'll sleep for"
831,"forty eight hours, and when she wakes I want absolute peace and quiet"
832,for her. Do you understand? 
833,POLLY: Are you sure she's all right? 
834,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, she's all right. "
835,POLLY: Excuse me. 
836,SUMMER: She can go down to my house in the country. My wife will look
837,after her.

839,you. 
840,"SUMMER: Indeed I will. Polly, would. Oh, where has that girl gone to? "

883,"DOCTOR: Oh, dear me, it's just as I feared. "
884,BEN: Is there something wrong? Where's Dodo? 
885,"DOCTOR: Oh, she's a little under the weather and she's gone into the"
886,country for a few days. 
887,"BEN: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. "
888,"DOCTOR: Oh she'll be quite all right, yes, really. I'm rather worried"
889,"about Polly. She appears to be missing, that child. "
890,"BEN: Oh, probably gone all snooty on us. "
891,"DOCTOR: No, I think it's far more serious than that. That tramp in the"
892,paper. Did you see it? 
893,BEN: Of course. I thought I recognised him. He was in the taxi. But how
894,does this connect with Polly? 
895,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm not so sure that it does, my boy. That's why I want"
896,"to solicit your help in this matter. I think, er, I don't think you"
897,will arouse so much suspicion as the police might. 
898,"BEN: Well, just tell me what to do. "
899,"DOCTOR: Well, I want you to investigate in and around that"
900,neighbourhood where we were last night in that club. 
901,"BEN: Oh, yeah. The tramp had a sort of home round there. Well, I'll go"
902,right now. 
903,"DOCTOR: Yes, and be careful, my boy. This might be dangerous. "
904,"BEN: I'll watch it, Doctor."

917,(The hammer arm smashes a desk.) 
918,GREEN: Test satisfactory. Stand by for sight test. Commence testing. 
919,(A searchlight moves across where Ben is hiding behind some crates. He
920,ducks down.) 
921,GREEN: Sight to be improved! Thirty yards maximum insufficient.
922,Movement test. Commence testing. 
923,"(WM9 moves forward until it hits boxes, then WM3 continuity error?"

931,
932,(Green walks up to the machine and Ben makes a dash
933,for a pair of doors.) 
934,GREEN: This is a warning! Danger! There is a stranger. He must be found
935,and eliminated at once. Stop your work and start searching immediately.
936,He must be found.

940," BEN: Polly, what are you doing here? "
941,POLLY: I came to look for you. 
942,"BEN: What, did the Doctor tell you where I was? "
943,POLLY: Yes. 
944,"BEN: Look, be careful. Don't go in there. "
945,POLLY: Why? 
946,"BEN: Well, it's incredible. I must get back to the Doctor and report to"
947,him. 
948,POLLY: What is incredible? What have you seen in there? 
949,"BEN: I can't tell you now, Duchess. "
950,(An unemotional Polly goes to the doors.) 
951,"BEN: Look, keep back, Polly. I'm telling you, come on. "
952,POLLY: Why? 
953,"BEN: Because the people in there have gone mad. Well, they seem as"
954,though they've been hypnotised or brainwashed. 
955,POLLY: What else did you see? 
956,"BEN: There was a mechanical monster. And it moved, it just killed"
957,"someone. Come on, we must get out of here. "
958,(She doesn't move.) 
959,"BEN: Look, Polly, come on!"
960,
961, [Warehouse]
962,
963," GREEN: The stranger is beyond that door, bearing"
964,two hundred and fifteen degrees. He must be taken at once. He is a
965,threat to the security of the War Machines. On no account must he
966,escape.

979,(Polly moves forward and Ben puts the latch on the
980,inner door.) 
981,"BEN: That's it, girl. Now come on, let's get out of here. "
982,(But Polly is bolting the door to the street.) 
983,"BEN: Have you gone mad? What are you doing? Look, for Pete's sake,"
984,"Polly, open it! "
985,POLLY: I have my instructions. 
986,"BEN: Polly, what's happened to you? "
987,POLLY: You are not to escape. 
988,"BEN: Look, I've got to get out of here. Come on, get out of the way! "
989,(He struggles with her but she is determined to do up the bolts.) 
990,"BEN: Look, Polly, get out of the way. "
991,POLLY: You are not to escape! 
992,BEN: Must get away! 
993,POLLY: Help! 
994,(Two men rush into the room and grab Ben.)

1004,BEN: Polly!

1007,
1008,(The Doctor is looking at his pocket watch.) 
1009,"DOCTOR: Oh dear, dear, dear, dear, dear. "
1010,"SUMMER: Well, take my advice, Doctor. It's no good upsetting yourself. "
1011,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, that boy, that boy should be back here ages ago. "
1012,"SUMMER: Well, you know what young people are. He's probably been"
1013,distracted by something. 
1014,"DOCTOR: Well, he seemed quite a responsible young lad. I suppose if he"
1015,"hasn't phoned it's because he hasn't been, er, well, he has not been"
1016,able to. 
1017,"SUMMER: Well, what do you suppose stopped him? Well, I must say, we've"
1018,given him four hours. Perhaps it is time that I asked the police to
1019,investigate? 
1020,DOCTOR: No Sir Charles. I don't think we should allow the police to
1021,intervene at the moment. Otherwise we might drive this threat further
1022,underground or wherever it is. 
1023,"SUMMER: Precisely. Whatever it is. Oh, damn it, man, you've got no"
1024,evidence. We simply cannot let rumour upset the big switch on. 
1025,"DOCTOR: Well, unless I'm very much mistaken we're going to have a lot"
1026,"more than rumour to contend with. Oh, dear me, where is that boy? "
1027, [Warehouse]
1028,
1029, GREEN: You tried to warn human authority of our
1030,work in this building. You are an enemy of mechanised evolution.
1031,Nothing must be allowed to prevent the machines taking over. They are
1032,the next stage in the growth of life force of Earth. All obstacles will
1033,"be swept aside, including you. "
1034,BEN: Are you all mad?! It'll be your turn next. 
1035,GREEN: We are needed by WOTAN. WOTAN will decide our fate. 
1036,"BEN: You are mad. All of you. Look, Polly, can't you see what's"
1037,happened to you? 
1038,GREEN: What does the girl want? 
1039,POLLY: I trapped him. I did not let him escape. 
1040,GREEN: That is true. 
1041,POLLY: WOTAN requires all the labour we can find. It is too soon to
1042,destroy this stranger. Let him work and destroy him later. 
1043,GREEN: How do you know what WOTAN wants? 
1044,POLLY: I have just come from Professor Brett. These are his orders and
1045,the orders of WOTAN. 
1046,"GREEN: Very well, let him live. He will work for us. We must all work."
1047,Go back to your work. 
1048,"BEN: Strewth, that was a close one. Thanks, girl. Well, you really"
1049,played them along. You even had me fooled. 
1050,POLLY: You have been spared. Now you must work hard for the success of
1051,this great new cause. 
1052,BEN: Eh? What cause? 
1053,POLLY: The victory of the War Machines.
1054,
1055, [Brett's laboratory]
1056,
1057, BRETT: All War Machines will be ready to attack by
1058,noon tomorrow. 
1059,KRIMPTON: Machines have been programmed to destroy any form of human
1060,life that opposes them. The order to attack must come from WOTAN alone.
1061,
1062,BRETT: None are fully completed yet. The Covent Garden machine is now
1063,on it's final tests. 
1064,KRIMPTON: The programming of these machines is near completion. 
1065,BRETT: All War Machines must be disciplined. They must attack
1066,simultaneously. 
1067,"KRIMPTON: Object of attack, to take over strategic centres and assume"
1068,control of all human authority.
1069,
1070, [Warehouse]
1071,
1072, GREEN: Faster! All human beings who break down
1073,will be eliminated. 
1074,(Green knocks down one man.) 
1075,GREEN: There is no time for rest. You must follow the example of the
1076,machines. 
1077,"(The War Machine rolls the body across the floor. Elsewhere, Ben and"
1078,Polly are moving boxes.) 
1079,"BEN: Are you okay, ducks? "
1080,POLLY: Why do you speak? 
1081,"BEN: Well, look at you, you're nearly on the ground. "
1082,POLLY: I'm very well. I am happy to work for the success of the
1083,Machines. 
1084,"BEN: Look, come off it, love. You can hardly stand up. "
1085,POLLY: That is not important. 
1086,"BEN: Oh yeah, sure. "
1087,POLLY: Must not stop. All work must be complete by tomorrow noon. 
1088,"BEN: Well, why by noon? "
1089,POLLY: The attack is to begin. 
1090,BEN: Attack? 
1091,POLLY: The takeover of London by the War Machines. 
1092,"BEN: Oh that. And you're looking forward to it, eh? "
1093,POLLY: Of course. 
1094,"BEN: Yeah, we're all so keen they've even taken the guard off the door."
1095,
1096,POLLY: Naturally. None of us wish to leave. We all wish to stay for the
1097,moment of victory. 
1098,"BEN: Oh yeah, victory, that's right. And we'll all be here won't we? "
1099,POLLY: Yes. 
1100,GREEN : All explosives to be collected here. 
1101,(Mortar bombs are being packed and rifles stacked. Polly is still
1102,stacking ammo boxes. Their eyes meet then she carries on. Ben slips
1103,away.) 
1104,GREEN: All explosives to be examined and primed ready for use by noon
1105,tomorrow. Work. Work! The success of the War Machines depends upon us.

1114," DOCTOR: Well, I can't wait any longer. I must take"
1115,a look for myself. 
1116,"SUMMER: But, Doctor! "
1117,"DOCTOR: After what happened to Dodo, my dear sir, we should never have"
1118,let those youngsters out of our sight. 
1119,(A doorbell rings.) 
1120,DOCTOR: That might be Ben now. 
1121,SUMMER: I'll see. 
1122,"DOCTOR: Ah, come in my dear. Good heavens. "
1123,"(Ben stumbles into the room, gasping for breath.) "
1124,"DOCTOR: My dear boy. What's happened to you, lad? "
1125,SUMMER: Are you all right? 
1126,"BEN: Yeah, I'm all right. "
1127,"DOCTOR: Now, take your time, take your time. Now, where's Polly? "
1128,"BEN: She's still there, Doctor. They've got her. She's one of them now."
1129,
1130,"DOCTOR: What do you mean, they've got her? Where is she? "
1131,BEN: She's in a warehouse. 
1132,DOCTOR: Where? 
1133,"BEN: A warehouse in Covent Garden. And there's a machine, a killer"
1134,"machine. And if we don't stop it, it'll kill half London!"
1135,
1136, [Warehouse]
1137,
1138, GREEN: Where is he? You are responsible for the
1139,"stranger, where is he? Do you know what has happened to him? Answer. "
1140,POLLY: He escaped. 
1141,GREEN: How do you know? 
1142,POLLY: I saw him. 
1143,GREEN: You saw him and you did not give the alarm? 
1144,POLLY: No. GREEN: Why not? 
1145,POLLY: I don't know. 
1146,"GREEN: You are working for the machines, you are an instrument only."
1147,"You have no friends, no will of your own. "
1148,POLLY: Friends. He was my friend. 
1149,GREEN: She has betrayed the WOTAN. She therefore must be sent back to
1150,WOTAN to be punished.
1151,
1152, [Summer's office]
1153,
1154, SUMMER: Don't tell me that you believe this
1155,"fantastic story, Doctor? "
1156,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm afraid I do. "
1157,"SUMMER: What, that this machine made by man, that it's suddenly come to"
1158,life? 
1159,"DOCTOR: Yes, I had suspected something of that sort. "
1160,"SUMMER: Oh, come on, Doctor. The boy's been suffering some sort of"
1161,delusion. 
1162,"DOCTOR: Oh, my dear Sir Charles! How could you know that? "
1163,"SUMMER: Because it's impossible. Here, in the heart of London? "
1164,"BEN: Look, I'm telling you, it has happened! Don't let's waste any more"
1165,time arguing! 
1166,"DOCTOR: We are not wasting time, my dear boy. We need Sir Charles'"
1167,"authority, his help. Without this we can do nothing. "
1168,"BEN: Look, Sir Charles, every minute we waste is dangerous. They look"
1169,as if they're preparing an arsenal to blow up London. 
1170,"SUMMER: Well if this is so, why weren't the police informed? "
1171,"BEN: Well I'm tellin' you now, aren't I? I nearly got done, what more"
1172,do you want? You inform them. If you don't it'll be on your own head. 
1173,"SUMMER: I don't like your tone, young man. "
1174,DOCTOR: I am quite prepared to accept the truth of this boy's
1175,statement. 
1176,SUMMER: All right. If you consider it's necessary I'll have a word with
1177,the Commissioner of Police. 
1178,"DOCTOR: No, Sir Charles. I think the police might find it too big for"
1179,them to handle at the moment. 
1180,"SUMMER: Well, that is for them to decide. How many of them were there? "
1181,BEN: About twenty. 
1182,DOCTOR: And you say that they were obeying this machine? 
1183,BEN: Yeah. They said something about 'all machines must be ready by
1184,noon tomorrow'. Then they attack. 
1185,"SUMMER: Ah, well, we shall see. It should be a fairly simple matter to"
1186,surround this place and arrest twenty people. 
1187,"BEN: And who'll do that, the coppers? "
1188,SUMMER: That is what the police are for. 
1189,BEN: But that machine will make mincemeat of them in twenty seconds
1190,flat. 
1191,SUMMER: Then presumably they'll send for the army and that'll put a
1192,stop to this machine of yours. 
1193,DOCTOR: I'm afraid we've got all our priorities mixed up. They might be
1194,"able to destroy this machine, but in all probability there are others"
1195,waiting to attack us. 
1196,"BEN: Well, I'm sure there are. "
1197,DOCTOR: Exactly. And we don't know their location. And I doubt very
1198,"much if we can find them all by tomorrow noon. No, I think we should"
1199,strike at what I believe to be the centre of this menace. WOTAN. 
1200,SUMMER: Oh now I hardly think that'll be necessary. There's no evidence
1201,to link Professor Brett with this machine of yours. 
1202,BEN: No link up? What about Polly? 
1203,"SUMMER: I've had quite enough from you, young man. I shall handle this"
1204,affair in my own way. 
1205,(Summer leaves.) 
1206,"BEN: Well, what's he going to do? "
1207,"DOCTOR: Well, I fear we've riled him, my boy. You see, the official"
1208,"mind can only take in so much at a time. However, we must keep our"
1209,weather eyes open. Come along.

1213,(Sir Charles is trying to make a telephone call.) 
1214,"SUMMER: Hello? Hello? Hello, operator? I seem to have been cut off. Ah,"
1215,"is that you Minister? No? Well for heavens sake, call him out of the"
1216,"conference, man. This is an emergency! What's that? No, I'm not telling"
1217,"you again. Ah, is that you, Minister? Yes, yes, this is very serious"
1218,"indeed. Some kind of killer machine, I'm told. Yes, like a tank. It has"
1219,"about twenty men with it. Yes, I should say this would call for"
1220,"firearms. Just as well to be prepared. What? What, you think you might"
1221,"call the army? Well, just as you say, of course. No. No, well, I've"
1222,"given your man all the details. It's in the Covent Garden area, I'm"
1223,"told. Fine. Right. Well, I'm off down there right away. Goodbye,"

1230,"SERGEANT: These are the bearings, sir. They intersect here. "
1231,"CAPTAIN: Yes, that's the building, isn't it, Sir Charles? "
1232,"SUMMER: Yes, that's it. "
1233,"CAPTAIN: Thank you, Sergeant. "
1234,SERGEANT: Sir. 
1235,CAPTAIN: We've been taking bearings. There's a good deal of radio and
1236,electrical activity there. Have you any idea what's causing it? 
1237,SUMMER: Well I've been given to understand there's a large amount of
1238,explosive in there and a new kind of War Machine. Though how much truth
1239,there is in that I don't know. 
1240,CAPTAIN: And the people inside? 
1241,SUMMER: We don't know how they'll react yet. 
1242,"CAPTAIN: Well, they won't get far. We've got a couple of platoons"
1243,"covering the back of the building, and my lads watching both ends of"
1244,this road watching the front. 
1245,"SUMMER: Yes, well, I think we'd better have a look inside first. Send"
1246,some of your men in. 
1247,CAPTAIN: It's all arranged. There's a patrol standing by. Say the word
1248,and they'll go in and have a look around. 
1249,"SUMMER: This, er, might be a little more dangerous than we think. "
1250,"CAPTAIN: Don't worry, Sir Charles, my lads can handle it. "
1251,"SUMMER: All right, then. When you're ready, go ahead. "
1252,"CAPTAIN: All right, Sergeant, stage one. "
1253,"SERGEANT: Calling Orange Patrol, calling Orange Patrol. Your objective"

1314,CORPORAL: It's over there. 
1315,(A war machine comes down the alleyway. It sets a stack of crates on

1371,"10 Downing Street this morning, and service chiefs were called in. The"

1384,"DOCTOR: Oh, how do you do sir! "
1385,"MINISTER: Oh well now, do you have any idea what caused the collapse,"
1386,gentlemen? 
1387,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, this is all very simple. This is a computer, and this"
1388,computer hasn't been completely programmed. 
1389,"MINISTER: Can you make that a little clearer, Doctor? "
1390,"SUMMER: There, you see, computers depend upon programming. That is, the"
1391,information that is fed into it. 
1392,"DOCTOR: Exactly, and my guess is this was put into action before it was"
1393,"ready, sir. "
1394,SUMMER: Because it had to be. Because we launched our attack. You see
1395,"Mister Minister, if we had not send those army units in, the maniac"
1396,behind this business would have had time to finish the job and I doubt
1397,if very many of us would have been left alive.

1425,"MINISTER: Have you discovered something, Doctor? "
1426,"DOCTOR: Well, yes, I think I've managed to decode the programme"
1427,"mechanism. And if I'm right, I think there are eleven others in London,"
1428,perhaps in an area of twenty to thirty miles. And this has it's own
1429,"timing device, this computer. And I think if my calculations are right,"
1430,then we conclude that they were intended to attack at twelve o'clock

1484,"we get in the GPO tower, the better. "
1485,"DOCTOR: What do you intend to do there, sir? "
1486,"SUMMER: Well, get hold of Brett and get him out of it. "

1528,"station and it's creating absolute havoc. Well, we've tried the army."
1529,What else is there? 
1530,"MINISTER: Yeah. Haven't you anything you can suggest, Doctor? This is"

1533,MINISTER: Get hold of it? 
1534,"DOCTOR: Yes, and I think our only one chance is to paralyse the nervous"

1554,say twenty feet. 
1555,SUMMER: Won't that be dangerous? 
1556,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm afraid that we have no choice, gentlemen. "
1557,SUMMER: And supposing that fails? 
1558,"MINISTER: Then we shall turn to other means, gentlemen. "
1559,"SUMMER: Right. Well, where is it you want this equipment? "

1584,magnetic field I want a four square box formed by four cables. 
1585,SUMMER: But the machine will never cross the first cable. 
1586,"DOCTOR: Well exactly! Therefore, we must prepare these three first and"
1587,"then, when the machine has approached and appeared in that position we"
1588,connect the fourth cable and switch on.
