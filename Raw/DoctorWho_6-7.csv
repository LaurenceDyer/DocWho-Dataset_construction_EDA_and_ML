23, [No Man's Land]
24,
25, (A scene of mud and desolation. The Tardis
26,"materialises in a puddle, and Jamie steps out into it. Zoe is sensibly"
27,"wearing a trench coat, jodhpurs and knee high boots.) "
28,JAMIE: What a place. 
29,ZOE: Where are we? Earth? 
30,"DOCTOR: Well, it looks like it, Zoe. Come on. "
31,(They pick their way over and up a slope. The Doctor whistles
32,'A-hunting we will go' happily to himself.) 
33,ZOE: What's this stuff? 
34,"JAMIE: Aye, wee spikes. "
35,(Jamie pricks his finger.) 
36,"DOCTOR: Barbed wire, Jamie. It's filthy stuff. I thought so. "
37,JAMIE: Eh? 
38,(The Doctor pulls a tin helmet from underneath some wood.) 
39,JAMIE: Where are we? 
40,"DOCTOR: We're back in history, Jamie. One of the most terrible times on"
41,the planet Earth. 
42,"(Whee, boom!) "
43,DOCTOR: Quick! Down there! 
44,(They dive into a nearby bomb crater in the ground. Another shell
45,explodes nearby as Jamie stands to watch.) 
46,DOCTOR: Jamie! 
47,(More explosions and machine gun fire. They get splattered with soil.
48,"An army ambulance comes trundling up through the explosions, then"
49,suddenly all goes quiet. A woman in a great coat is standing by the
50,crater.) 
51,"BUCKINGHAM: I say, are you all right? "
52,"DOCTOR: Well, yes, I think so. "
53,BUCKINGHAM: I shouldn't stay around here if I were you. That was just
54,the softening up barrage. 
55,DOCTOR: What? 
56,JAMIE: Eh? 
57,DOCTOR: Oh. Oh my. Oh. 
58,"BUCKINGHAM: What on earth are you doing here, anyway? This is no place"
59,for civilians. 
60,"DOCTOR: Well, where are we? "
61,"BUCKINGHAM: Between the lines, I think. Not quite sure myself. I'm"
62,"heading for Ypres, but I seem to have got "
63,(Two soldiers in gas masks are standing next to them.) 
64,GERMAN: HÃ¤nde hock. Raus schnell. 
65,(The four are taken at gunpoint to the ambulance and driven off.
66,"Buckingham is behind the wheel. Further on, two men come running over a"
67,rise. Buckingham stops the ambulance. The officer puts his revolver to
68,the German's head.) 
69,CARSTAIRS: Out you come. 
70,(Played by  David Savile. I used
71,to have such a crush on him.) 
72,BUCKINGHAM: There's another in the back. 
73,CARSTAIRS: Take care of him. 
74,(Carstairs leaves his soldier covering the man up front and goes to the
75,back of the ambulance. Jamie and the Doctor have already overpowered
76,the other German.) 
77,CARSTAIRS: Well done. Get inside. 
78,(The British and German soldiers are bundled into the back. Carstairs
79,sits next to Buckingham up front.) 
80,CARSTAIRS: Who are those people? 
81,BUCKINGHAM: No idea. Picked them up in no man's land. 
82,"CARSTAIRS: Well, I suppose we'd better get them back to base."
83,
84, [Field office]
85,
86," (Adjoining the trench, Captain Blackadder is"
87,reporting up the telephone line. Explosions are heard almost
88,constantly.) 
89,BARRINGTON: They've laid down a heavy barrage all along the line. I
90,"think that they're after that ammo dump. Don't worry, sir. We'll hold"
91,out. 
92,SERGEANT: Sir? 
93,BARRINGTON: What is it? 
94,"SERGEANT: Ambulance approaching, sir. "
95,BARRINGTON: Give it protective fire. Jump to it. man! 
96,SERGEANT: Sir.
97,
98, [Trench]
99,
100, SERGEANT: Hold your fire! Hold it. Come on. Come
101,"on. Get down, get down. "
102,(Zoe makes her way behind the troops firing over the top of the trench
103,"as Carstairs helps Buckingham, the Doctor and Jamie down.) "
104,"CARSTAIRS: Couple of prisoners, Sergeant. My men are bringing them in. "
105,"SERGEANT: Very good, sir. "
106,JAMIE: How are we going to get back to the Tardis? 
107,"DOCTOR: Now, just be quiet, Jamie, and let me do the talking."
108,
109, [Field office]
110,
111, SERGEANT: Sir? 
112,BARRINGTON: What is it now? 
113,"SERGEANT: With the ambulance, sir, there was a Lieutenant. "
114,"BARRINGTON: Well, bring him in. "
115,SERGEANT: Sir. 
116,"(The Sergeant leaves, Carstairs enters.) "
117,"CARSTAIRS: Lieutenant Carstairs, sir. "
118,BARRINGTON: What are you doing here? You don't belong to this
119,"battalion, do you? "
120,"CARSTAIRS: No. Patrolling in no mans land, sir. I got cut off from my"
121,own lot. 
122,BARRINGTON: What were you doing traipsing about in ambulances? 
123,"CARSTAIRS: Recaptured it from the Hun, sir. Lucky we arrived, really."
124,"There was a WVR driving it, and three civilians inside. "
125,BARRINGTON: Civilians? In no man's land? 
126,"CARSTAIRS: Your sergeant's taking care of them, sir. "
127,BARRINGTON: Good grief. Civilians.
128,
129, [Trench]
130,
131,(The travellers have been given mugs of tea.) 
132,"JAMIE: The thing is, where are we? "
133,"ZOE: Early twentieth century isn't it, Doctor? "
134,DOCTOR: Yes. I'm afraid that we've landed up in the middle of one of
135,the worst wars in human history. 
136,JAMIE: What are they dug into the ground like this for? 
137,"DOCTOR: Well, it's trench warfare, you see, Jamie. These trenches"
138,stretch right the way across the continent of Europe. 
139,"JAMIE: Well, what are they fighting for? "
140,"DOCTOR: Well, I well I believe that they call it The War to End Wars. "
141,ZOE: Do you think they'll let us go? 
142,"DOCTOR: Well, they've got no reason to keep us. Here, things have"
143,calmed down a bit. Let's try and get away. 
144,"(But as soon as he puts his head up over the top of the trench, machine"
145,gun fire.) 
146,DOCTOR: Oh! 
147,SERGEANT: What do you think you're doing? 
148,"DOCTOR: Our transportation is over there, you see. We're trying to get"
149,to it. 
150,"SERGEANT: Over there? There's nothing over there but Huns. Anyway, the"
151,Major wants to see you. 
152,"DOCTOR: Oh, we don't want to bother him. I'm sure he's very busy. "
153,"SERGEANT: Come on! You too, ma'am, if you don't mind."
154,
155, [Field office]
156,
157," BARRINGTON: Right, sir. We'll go over the top at"
158,"oh four hundred hours. Sir. As you say, sir. Well, that was General"
159,Smythe. Big push tomorrow. How long have you been out here? 
160,"CARSTAIRS: Well, sir, it's odd, but I can't quite remember. "
161,"BARRINGTON: I know. It seems like forever, doesn't it? "
162,"SERGEANT: Civilian party, sir. Major Barrington, ma'am. "
163,"BARRINGTON: How do you do, er? "
164,BUCKINGHAM: Jennifer Buckingham. 
165,BARRINGTON: Ah. I understand you picked these people up in no man's
166,land? 
167,BUCKINGHAM: Yes. Found them hiding in a bomb crater. 
168,BARRINGTON: I see. May I ask you what you were doing there? 
169,DOCTOR: Trying not to get killed. 
170,"BARRINGTON: I see. You're a Highlander, aren't you? Why aren't you with"
171,your regiment? 
172,JAMIE: Regiment? I'm not in the army. 
173,BARRINGTON: Are you a deserter? 
174,"JAMIE: No, of course not! I "
175,"BARRINGTON: All right, all right. And you, what are you doing in the"
176,front line? No place for young ladies. 
177,ZOE: Well what about her? 
178,BARRINGTON: This lady's a WVR. She's here on duty. 
179,"DOCTOR: Er, look, Major, we don't want to trouble you. If you'd just"
180,let us go on our way. 
181,BARRINGTON: And which way is that? 
182,"SERGEANT: He tried to make off towards the German line, sir. "
183,"BARRINGTON: Did he, by jove. "
184,"(Whee, Boom! Bits of ceiling come down.) "
185,BARRINGTON: I think General Smythe would like to know about you. (into
186,telephone) Get me General Smythe at base.
187,
188, [British command post]
189,
190,(The General sits at a simple folding table in a
191,"once great stately home, talking into a field telephone.) "
192,"SMYTHE: Civilians? In no man's land? Yes. Well, send them back here at"
193,once. I'll question them myself. 
194,(The General's adjutant enters.) 
195,SMYTHE: Three civilians found in no man's land. 
196,"RANSOM: Good lord. Whereabouts, sir? "
197,SMYTHE: Barrington's sector. He's sending them straight back here. I'm
198,going to turn in for half an hour. 
199,SMYTHE: Sir. 
200,SMYTHE: Let me know when these civilians arrive. 
201,"RANSOM: Yes, sir. "
202,(The obligatory mug of tea arrives.) 
203,"RANSOM: Thank you, Sergeant Major."
204,
205, [Smythe's room]
206,
207, (A wood panelled room with a large trunk on its
208,end in the corner. Smythe reaches for a portrait on the wall when the
209,door opens. It's the Sergeant Major with his mug of tea.) 
210,SMYTHE: Don't ever come through that door without knocking! Get out! 
211,"BURNS: Right, sir. "
212,(He leaves. Smythe reaches for the portrait again and it swings open on
213,hinges to reveal a circular monitor and a dial. Smythe turns it on.) 
214,"SMYTHE: Smythe, 1917 zone, British sector. Reinforcements urgently"
215,required. At least five thousand specimens.
216,
217, [Field office]
218,
219," DOCTOR: But look, Major Barrington, if only you'd"
220,let us get back to our transportation we'd be no further nuisance to
221,you. 
222,"BARRINGTON: I'm sorry, you must first go to the Chateau and give a"
223,proper account of yourselves. For all I know you may be spies. 
224,"JAMIE: Oh look, we keep trying to tell you, you daft sassenach. "
225,"BARRINGTON: Hold your tongue, man! "
226,"JAMIE: No, I won't! "
227,DOCTOR: Now please! Don't let us lose our tempers. 
228,"SERGEANT: Supply truck leaving for base now, sir. "
229,BARRINGTON: Good. Get them onto it. Off you go. 
230,"JAMIE: Now, just a moment, we're not going back to any base. Now, come"
231,on. 
232,BARRINGTON: Sentry! 
233,(Jamie's exit is stopped by a soldier and rifle.) 
234,"DOCTOR: Jamie, I think perhaps we'd better do as they say. "
235,"BARRINGTON: I'm glad one of you is showing some sense. All right,"
236,"Sergeant, take them away. "
237,"SERGEANT: Yes, sir. "
238,"BUCKINGHAM: I'm sure you'll be all right. Anyway, good luck. "
239,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you very much. "
240,"(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe leave with the Sergeant.) "
241,"BARRINGTON: Now then, what are we going to do about you two? "
242,BUCKINGHAM: Could your men do something about my ambulance? It's bogged
243,down just over the hill. 
244,"BARRINGTON: Yes, soon get that out for you. "
245,(Barrington leaves.) 
246,BUCKINGHAM: Funny about those people. They didn't look like spies. 
247,CARSTAIRS: Spies never do. I don't envy them if they are. General
248,Smythe can be pretty ruthless. Know what my chaps call him? 
249,BUCKINGHAM: No. 
250,CARSTAIRS: The Butcher.
251,
252, [British command post]
253,Â 
254,
255," (The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe are marched under"
256,escort into a large room in a faded and dilapidated Chateau. A Sergeant
257,Major gives the orders.) 
258,"BURNS: Right, left, right, left, right, left, right. Prisoners and"
259,"escort, mark time! Halt! Right turn! Civilian prisoners from Major"
260,"Barrington, sir. "
261,RANSOM: All right. At ease. 
262,BURNS: Stand at ease! 
263,"(Jamie stamps his foot to the side, stepping on the Doctor.) "
264,BURNS: At ease. 
265,RANSOM: The General wants to question you personally. 
266,DOCTOR: Oh good. I'm sure we'll be able to explain everything to his
267,satisfaction. 
268,"JAMIE: Look, how long are we going to be kept here? "
269, [Smythe's room] 
270, (The room is empty.) 
271,RANSOM: Sir? 
272, [British command post] 
273," RANSOM: Take them to the cells, Sergeant Major. "
274,DOCTOR: But I thought you said we were going to see the General? 
275,RANSOM: The General is not available. Take them away. 
276,"BURNS: Prisoners and escort, attention! Right turn! "
277,"(No, the other right, Jamie.) "
278,"BURNS: By the front, quick march. Left, right, left, right. "
279,"ZOE: There's no need to keep shouting at us, you know. "
280,"SERGEANT MAJOR: Left, right, left, right, left."
281,
282, [Field office]
283,
284, (Carstairs pours himself some tea from a billy
285,can.) 
286,"CARSTAIRS: Oh, I'm sorry, do you want some more? "
287,BUCKINGHAM: Thanks. 
288,CARSTAIRS: Where is your hospital? 
289,"BUCKINGHAM: Oh, it's not far. "
290,CARSTAIRS: Whereabouts? 
291,"BUCKINGHAM: Well, you're going to think me awfully silly, but I can't"
292,quite remember. 
293,"CARSTAIRS: Don't worry, it'll come back to you. Memory's a funny thing"
294,out here. Can't always remember things myself. 
295,BUCKINGHAM: What kinds of things? 
296,"CARSTAIRS: Oh, silly things. Names, dates, how long I've been here."
297,Sometimes wonder if I've got a touch of the old shell shock. Have you
298,talked to anybody else about it? 
299,BUCKINGHAM: Haven't liked to. One feels so stupid. 
300,"CARSTAIRS: Yes. Still, it is rather worrying not being able to remember"
301,things. 
302,(The telephone rings.) 
303,CARSTAIRS: Ah. Suppose I'd better answer that. 
304,(Barrington rushes in and takes the receiver from Carstairs.) 
305,"BARRINGTON: Ah, thanks, old man. Major Barrington. Yes. Right, sir."
306,We're wanted at HQ. Some sort of enquiry to do with those civilians you
307,brought in. 
308,BUCKINGHAM: How long will it take? I'm bound to be needed back at the
309,hospital. 
310,BARRINGTON: We just got your ambulance out of the mud. We'll all go in
311,"that, and then you can go straight on from HQ. Are you ready?"
312,
313, [Wine cellar]
314,
315,"(No bottles, just racks and barrels.) "
316,JAMIE: And you'll not pick that lock with a hairgrip either. 
317,ZOE: These walls are solid stone. There's just no way out. 
318,"JAMIE: Now what do we do, then? "
319,"DOCTOR: It's just a temporary misunderstanding, Jamie. We'll get it"
320,cleared up when we see the General. 
321,ZOE: Why should he listen to us? No one else has. 
322,"DOCTOR: Ah, they were all obeying orders, Zoe. That's the military"
323,mind. 
324,ZOE: We must have looked a bit suspicious. Three civilians in the
325,middle of a war? 
326,"JAMIE: Aye, well, I just hope that General does listen to us. "
327,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, I expect he's a very nice chap."
328,
329, [British command post]
330,
331,(Smythe comes out of his room.) 
332,SMYTHE: Got those reports yet? 
333,"RANSOM: Just finished now, sir. "
334,SMYTHE: Thank you. 
335,"RANSOM: By the way, sir, those three civilians have turned up. I've got"
336,them in the cells. 
337,"SMYTHE: Oh, what of it? "
338,"RANSOM: As a matter of fact, I went into your room to tell you but "
339,(Smythe puts on his spectacles and stares at Ransom.) 
340,"SMYTHE: I was asleep, Captain Ransom. You did not wish to disturb me. "
341,"RANSOM: Yes, sir, you were asleep. I didn't wish to disturb you. "
342,"SMYTHE: That's right. Now, what did you make of these civilians? "
343,"RANSOM: Oh, two men and a young lady. According to Major Barrington"
344,they can't account for themselves. He seemed to think the younger lad
345,was a deserter. Apparently the older man tried to make off for the
346,enemy lines. 
347,"BURNS: Sir! Major Barrington, sir. "
348,SMYTHE: Thanks. 
349,(The Sergeant Major leaves.) 
350,"BARRINGTON: This is Lady Jennifer Buckingham, sir, and Lieutenant. "
351,SMYTHE: How do you do. Do sit down. 
352,BUCKINGHAM: Thank you. 
353,"SMYTHE: Barrington, you know my adjutant, Ransom, don't you? "
354,"BARRINGTON: Yes, we, er, Ransom and I were er "
355,(Smythe puts on his spectacles.) 
356,SMYTHE: You were at school together. You were at school together. 
357,"BARRINGTON: Yes, that's right. How are you Ransom? "
358,"SMYTHE: Now, Carstairs, tell me, where did you find these civilians? "
359,"(Later the Kings Regulations and Orders for the Army, 1912 is opened."
360,"Ransom, Smythe and Barrington are at the little table as a Court"
361,Martial.) 
362,"BURNS: Left, right, left, right. Escort and accused, mark time. Halt."
363,left turn. 
364,"DOCTOR: Major Barrington, how nice to see you. "
365,BURNS: Accused! Back in line. 
366,"SMYTHE: If you are ready, gentlemen? March the prisoners forward,"
367,Sergeant Major. 
368,"BURNS: Sir! Accused, one pace forward, march. "
369,"JAMIE: Now, look, what's going on here? "
370,SMYTHE: The Court Martial is now in session. 
371,DOCTOR: Court Martial? But we're civilians. 
372,SMYTHE: This whole area is under martial law. 
373,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, that may be, but if you'll allow me to explain, we"
374,were 
375,SMYTHE: You will have an opportunity of addressing the Court at the
376,proper time. 
377,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. "
378,"SMYTHE: Now, the statements of Lieutenant Carstairs and Lady Jennifer"
379,have been taken into evidence. The prisoners waylaid an ambulance in no
380,man's land 
381,DOCTOR: Waylaid? The ambulance found us. 
382,SMYTHE: The vehicle was later commandeered by a waiting enemy patrol.
383,"Recaptured by Lieutenant Carstairs, the prisoners insinuated themselves"
384,"into a forward command post, where at the earliest opportunity one of"
385,them made a break for the enemy lines with whatever information he had
386,gathered. 
387,"ZOE: Oh, but none of that's true. You've twisted the whole thing. "
388,DOCTOR: This is a travesty of justice. What are we charged with? 
389,"SMYTHE: In the case of this man, desertion from a Highland regiment. "
390,"JAMIE: But, but "
391,"SMYTHE: In the case of yourself and the girl, the charge is one of"
392,espionage. The penalty for all these charges is death. 
393,DOCTOR: But this is monstrous! 
394,SMYTHE: We shall now hear the case for the defence. Have you anything
395,to say? 
396,"DOCTOR: Yes, I most certainly have! Am I allowed to question the"
397,witnesses? 
398,SMYTHE: Certainly. We wish to give you every opportunity to explain
399,yourselves. 
400,"DOCTOR: Thank you. Lady Jennifer, will you please explain to these"
401,gentlemen the circumstances of our meeting. 
402,SMYTHE: There's no need for that. It's in the statement. Next
403,question.Â 
404,"DOCTOR: What? Well, Lieutenant Carstairs, when your men recaptured the"
405,"ambulance, wasn't it obvious to you we were prisoners of the Germans? "
406,SMYTHE: Has the defence finished with this witness? 
407,"DOCTOR: Well, if you're not going to allow them to answer, what is the"
408,use? 
409,SMYTHE: Very well. Have you any explanation to offer before the Court
410,passes sentence? 
411,ZOE: But you haven't heard anything yet. You don't really call this a
412,"trial, do you? "
413,SMYTHE: The Court will now consider it's verdict. 
414,"JAMIE: Hey, you haven't even asked me anything. "
415,"SMYTHE: There's nothing to ask you. You are a deserter! March him away,"
416,Sergeant Major! 
417,"BURNS: Sir. Escort and accused, left turn. Left wheel, by the front,"
418,"quick march! Left, right, left, right. Halt! "
419,JAMIE: I thought you were going to explain everything? 
420,"DOCTOR: Well, he didn't give me a chance, did he. There's something"
421,very strangely wrong here. 
422,ZOE: Why has that General got it in for us? He seems determined to find
423,us guilty. 
424,"DOCTOR: Yes, but why? "
425,RANSOM: I don't know. They seem pretty harmless to me. 
426,"BARRINGTON: Yes, there's no actual evidence of them actually spying on"
427,anything. 
428,(Smythe puts on his spectacles.) 
429,SMYTHE: It is quite clear that they are all guilty. All guilty! 
430,"BARRINGTON: Yes, they're guilty. Knew it as soon as I looked at them. "
431,RANSOM: There's clear evidence that they were spying. 
432,"SMYTHE: Thank you, gentlemen. Well, I think we can resume. Sergeant"
433,"Major, bring the prisoners back. "
434,"BURNS: Escort and accused, left wheel! By the front, quick march. Left,"
435,"right, left, right, left wheel. Mark time. Halt! Right turn! "
436,SMYTHE: The Court has carefully considered all of the evidence and
437,finds you all guilty as charged. Desertion in a time of war is a most
438,heinous military crime. 
439,"JAMIE: Look, I've deserted from nowhere! I was never in your rotten"
440,army. 
441,SMYTHE: You will be confined to a military barracks awaiting a
442,regimental Court Martial. 
443,"JAMIE: Now look, I'm not being confined anywhere. "
444,"SMYTHE: You, young lady, have betrayed your King and country. You are"
445,sentenced to ten years penal servitude to be spent in a civilian
446,prison. 
447,ZOE: Oh but I haven't done anything! 
448,SMYTHE: The court finds you guilty of espionage. For a crime of this
449,magnitude there is only one penalty. 
450,DOCTOR: But this is ridiculous! You know all the evidence has been
451,twisted against us! Tell them! 
452,SMYTHE: The witnesses have given their evidence. The court has reached
453,"it's verdict. If you've nothing further to say, sentence will be"
454,passed. 
455,DOCTOR: I most certainly have something further to say! This is all
456,just a mockery! I demand the right to appeal to a higher authority. 
457,SMYTHE: There is no right of appeal. You will be executed at dawn
458,"tomorrow. Take him away, Sergeant Major! "
459,"BURNS: Prisoners and escort, left turn! "
460,"JAMIE: Now just a moment, you can't do this to us! "
461,BURNS: Hold him! 
462,JAMIE: Let go! 
463,SERGEANT MAJOR: Hand him over to the MPs. They'll take him to the
464,military prison. 
465,(Jamie is taken away.) 
466,"BURNS: I'll take these two back to the cell, sir.Â "
467,"BUCKINGHAM: Just a minute, Sergeant Major. Captain Ransom, surely"
468,you're not going to keep this poor girl in the cells all night? 
469,"RANSOM: Well, we've nowhere else to keep her. "
470,"BUCKINGHAM: Well, why not leave her here? I could look after her. "
471,"RANSOM: Yes, I don't see why not. "
472,BUCKINGHAM: Thank you. 
473,"RANSOM: All right, put a guard on the door, Sergeant Major, and take"
474,him away. 
475,BURNS: Sir! 
476,"ZOE: Oh I don't want to leave you, Doctor. "
477,"DOCTOR: Now you stay here, Zoe. Goodbye, my dear. "
478,(The Doctor kisses Zoe on the forehead and leaves with the Sergeant
479,Major.) 
480,"ZOE: Oh, can't you help us, Lieutenant Carstairs? "
481,"CARSTAIRS: Nothing I can do, I'm afraid. "
482,"BARRINGTON: Well, nice to have met you both. Must be getting back."
483,"Goodbye, my dear. Chin up. "
484,(Barrington leaves.) 
485,ZOE: But you can't let them execute the Doctor. He hasn't done
486,anything. 
487,"RANSOM: Well, you heard the evidence, my dear. It's all proved. I'm"
488,afraid he is a spy.
489,
490, [Wine cellar]
491,
492," BURNS : Left, right, left, right, left, right,"
493,"left, right, left, right. "
494,(The Doctor is marched in.) 
495,BURNS: I'll see that they bring you something to eat. 
496,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. Sergeant Major? Have you been at the front long?"
497,
498,"BURNS: Oh, quite a while. I've been out here since "
499,DOCTOR: What's the matter? 
500,"BURNS: Can't remember. Here, what are you asking me all these questions"
501,for? 
502, [Smythe's room]
503,
504, RANSOM: Sir? 
505,"SMYTHE: Yes, what is it? "
506,RANSOM: You wanted the keys to the prison cell. 
507,SMYTHE: Oh yes. Is everything arranged for the execution? 
508,RANSOM: Yes. 
509,SMYTHE: Very well. 
510,(Ransom leaves. Smythe puts the keys under his pillow and lies down. A
511,sentry checks on Zoe and Buckingham sleeping in chairs in the main
512,"room. Once he has gone, Zoe sneaks over to Smythe's room and goes"
513,inside. There is no one there. She discovers the monitor behind the
514,"portrait, then hunts for the keys, finds them and leaves.)"

516, [Wine cellar]

518, (The Doctor hides behind the door when he hears it
519,being unlocked.) 
520,DOCTOR: Zoe! 
521,ZOE: Oh Doctor! 
522,DOCTOR: How on Earth? 
523,"ZOE: Well, I couldn't leave you to be shot, could I? It's dawn. "
524,"DOCTOR: Oh, what a nice and clever girl you are. Now, we must find"
525,Jamie. They said something about a military prison. 
526,ZOE: Yes. 
527,DOCTOR: Come on. 
528,"RANSOM: Quite right, Doctor. It is time to go."

531,
532, (The firing squad is all ready and waiting. A
533,soldier holds Zoe by the arm as the Doctor is lead to a stake in front
534,of wall and fastened to it.) 
535,"RANSOM: Squad, attention! Present! Aim! "
536,(A volley of gunfire.) 
537, Episode Two
538,
539, [Farm yard]
540,
541, (Gunshot. The Doctor tenses up for the pain but it
542,is a soldier who has been injured. There is a sniper in one of the
543,barns nearby.) 
544,RANSOM: Divert! 
545,(The firing squad scatter to try and get the sniper. The soldier
546,guarding Zoe is hit and she runs to free the Doctor.) 
547,"DOCTOR: Well done, Zoe. Can you undo it? "
548,"ZOE: Oh, Doctor. "
549,(Zoe unties him.) 
550,ZOE: Come on!

553,
554, (Smythe is reporting to his controllers.) 
555,SMYTHE: I am leaving for the conference now. 
556,(Smythe turns off the monitor and closes the portrait over it. There is
557,a Tardis-like sound as a large metal object appears in the corner of
558,the room and an entrance slides forward from the centre. Ransom
559,enters.) 
560,"RANSOM: General Smythe, the prisoners have "
561,"SMYTHE: Ransom, get out! "
562,"RANSOM: Sir, what? "
563,(Smythe puts on his spectacles.) 
564,SMYTHE: There is nothing there. You can see nothing. 
565,"RANSOM: No, sir, there's nothing there. "
566,SMYTHE: You have not seen me. I have been called away to an important
567,meeting. 
568,RANSOM: Important meeting. Yes. 
569,"(Smythe goes into the SIDRAT, for that is what it is, the door closes"
570,and it dematerialises.) 
571,"RANSOM: General Smythe? Oh, of course, he's gone to that meeting."

575," (Still not a proper cell, but with barbed wire"
576,wrapped around the bars in the door grille.) 
577,"JAMIE: Hey, do I not get any breakfast? "
578,(Two guards throw another man in with Jamie. Dishevelled but still
579,wearing his powdered wig...) 
580,JAMIE: Redcoat? What are you doing here? 
581,"REDCOAT: Highlander! Keep away from me, you! "
582,"JAMIE: Hey, easy now. I'm a prisoner too, you know! How'd you get here?"
583,"Well, come on, how did you get here? "
584,"REDCOAT: I don't know, I can't remember! I got lost, I think. "
585,JAMIE: What year do you think it is? 
586,"REDCOAT: Year? Why, it's seventeen forty five. "
587,JAMIE: Sss?!
588,
589, [Forest edge]
590,
591, (The Doctor uses his telescope to spy out a set of
592,heavily guarded farm buildings complete with machine gun emplacements.)
593,
594,"DOCTOR: Oh yes. Yes. Yes, that's it. That's the military prison, all"
595,right. That's where Jamie'll be. Take a look. The trouble is those
596,sentries. 
597,ZOE: What are we going to do? 
598,DOCTOR: Don't know. I shall have to think of something. Come on. 
599,(They run down a slope to a road where a staff car is driving along.
600,The Doctor flags it down.) 
601,DOCTOR: Stop! And about time too! Where have you been? 
602,DRIVER: Eh? 
603,DOCTOR: You were sent to meet us! 
604,DRIVER: Meet who? 
605,"DOCTOR: Now don't argue! Take us to the prison! In you get, Miss"
606,"Heriot. Well, drive on! "
607, [Tack room]
608,
609," JAMIE: Look, you must try and remember! "
610,"REDCOAT: I've told you. I was fighting up in the Highlands, I got lost"
611,and I don't. There was this mist. 
612,JAMIE: Uh huh. 
613,"REDCOAT: It came down all round me. The next thing I knew, everything"
614,was different. 
615,"JAMIE: Well, how do you mean, different? "
616,"REDCOAT: Well, there were these great big guns, bigger than I'd ever"
617,"seen before, and carts moving along without horses. "
618,"JAMIE: Aye, I've seen those too. Now, go on, go on. "
619,"REDCOAT: Well, then these fellows in the funny uniforms, they came"
620,"along, and they caught me and brought me here. Where are we? "
621,"JAMIE: I don't know. But I've got to get to the Doctor. Look, and"
622,you're going to help me. 
623,"REDCOAT: Oh, no! I don't trust you. You're one of them rebels! "
624,"JAMIE: Now look, just you listen to me a moment. "
625,(Jamie advances on the Redcoat with a wheel spoke in his hand.)

630,another field telephone.) 
631,"GORTON: Who? Civilians? Well, tell them to wait. I'm having my tea. "
632,(But barely has he taken a sip when -) 
633,"DOCTOR: How dare you treat me like this, sir! "
634,GORTON: What? Who the blazes are you? 
635,"DOCTOR: Don't you address me like that, sir! This is disgraceful! I"
636,shall make a complaint directly to the Minister himself! 
637,(That would be Lord Derby.) 
638,"GORTON: Minister? Oh, I don't understand. Who are you? "
639,"DOCTOR: I'm the examiner from the War Office, I'm here to inspect the"
640,"military prison. This young lady is my secretary. Well, you were"
641,"expecting us, surely? "
642,"GORTON: Well, there must be some mistake. I mean, can I see your"
643,identification papers? 
644,"DOCTOR: How dare you! You send no car to meet us on our arrival, and"
645,now you add insult to injury by doubting my credentials! Do you know
646,"who I am, sir? "
647,"GORTON: Well, I'm terribly sorry and all that. It's probably my"
648,adjutant's fault. Would you care for some tea? 
649,DOCTOR: We are here to inspect the security arrangements of the prison.
650,Now I suggest we stop wasting time and get on with it!
651,
652, [British command post]
653,
654, RANSOM: Not a trace of them. General Smythe'll be
655,furious. We must get those people back. 
656,"CARSTAIRS: Yes, of course, sir. "
657,"RANSOM: Now, you're got to help me, both of you. Get a party from my"
658,sergeant and search this building. 
659,"CARSTAIRS: Yes, sir. "
660,RANSOM: I'll take a patrol towards the German lines. 
661,BUCKINGHAM: What shall I do? 
662,RANSOM: I'd like you to stay here and man the telephone. I've put out
663,"an alert and someone might phone in some information. All right,"
664,Carstairs? 
665,"CARSTAIRS: Yes, sir! "
666,"RANSOM: Lady Jennifer, if the General returns perhaps you'd explain"
667,what has happened? 
668,BUCKINGHAM: Certainly. Where's he gone? 
669,RANSOM: He's been called away to an urgent meeting. 
670,(Ransom leaves.) 
671,BUCKINGHAM: I know it's an awful thing to say but I can't help hoping
672,they get away. 
673,CARSTAIRS: I know just how you feel. Still 
674,RANSOM : Carstairs! 
675,CARSTAIRS: Excuse me.

680,"JAMIE: Help me, guard! He's trying to "
681,"REDCOAT: You're right, I'll kill you! "
682,JAMIE: He's trying to kill me! Stop it! 
683,(Two guards rush in and haul the Redcoat off Jamie.) 
684,GUARD: Get off him! 
685,JAMIE: Now! 
686,(Jamie rams the wheel spoke into the sergeant's belly then punches his
687,lights out while the Redcoat first knees then hits the other.) 
688,"JAMIE: You fight very well, for a redcoat. "
689, [British command post]
690,
691," BUCKINGHAM: All right, Corporal. I'll tell the"
692,Captain. 
693,(Carstairs enters.) 
694,BUCKINGHAM: Any luck? 
695,CARSTAIRS: Not a sign. 
696,BUCKINGHAM: That was one of the patrol posts. Nothing to report. 
697,CARSTAIRS: Poor old Ransom. He's in for a sticky time when the General
698,gets back. 
699,BUCKINGHAM: Didn't you think that there was something rather strange
700,about that court martial? 
701,"CARSTAIRS: Oh well, military justice, you know. It's not like the Old"
702,Bailey. 
703,"BUCKINGHAM: No, but, you remember we were talking about not remembering"
704,things? 
705,CARSTAIRS: Yes? 
706,"BUCKINGHAM: Well, things are starting to come back to me. "
707,CARSTAIRS: What sort of things? 
708,"BUCKINGHAM: Well, I was on my way to the hospital, well behind the"
709,lines. I was driving through a forest and all of a sudden there was a
710,strange sort of mist. Fog. And then I was in a field dressing station
711,looking after some wounded soldiers. 
712,CARSTAIRS: Hmm. Loss of memory. 
713,"BUCKINGHAM: No, but isn't it strange that you should to be suffering"
714,from it too? 
715,CARSTAIRS: Mist! 
716,BUCKINGHAM: What about it? 
717,"CARSTAIRS: I wonder, could it be some kind of new gas? If perhaps the"
718,"Germans have invented a new type of poison gas, one that affects our"
719,minds.
720,
721, [Commandant's office]
722,
723," GORTON: And finally, on the outer perimeter there"
724,are the concealed tripwires and the patrols. 
725,DOCTOR: Ah. 
726,ZOE: Certainly does look escape proof. 
727,DOCTOR: I'd like to see your records. 
728,"GORTON: What? Oh yes, they're over here. You won't find anything wrong"
729,there. 
730,(Gorton hands over a huge ledger.) 
731,DOCTOR: I sincerely hope not. 
732,GORTON: There you are.Â 
733,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. "
734,GORTON: Arrivals.Â 
735,DOCTOR: Yes. 
736,GORTON: Lengths of sentences. Discharges. 
737,"DOCTOR: Yes, arrivals. Latest arrival, Scottish deserter awaiting"
738,return to his regiment. Possible to talk to a prisoner? 
739,"GORTON: Well, er, it's very irregular. However, for you I'm sure that I"
740,can arrange (The telephone rings.) 
741,"GORTON: Excuse me. Gorton here. What? Escaped! Well, get onto it right"
742,"away, man. Let me know as soon as you've got them. "
743,"DOCTOR: Is something the matter, Commandant? "
744,"GORTON: Er, nothing important. "
745,DOCTOR: Did I hear you say that someone had escaped? 
746,"GORTON: Oh well, as a matter of fact, yes. Two chaps. One of them was"
747,the Scotsman that you were talking about.

752,when they have to step out into the open they are spotted.) 
753,GUARD: Halt or we fire! 
754,JAMIE: Come on! 
755,(The guards fire their revolvers.)
756,
757, [Commandant's office]
758,
759," GORTON: Shot? Both of them? I see, right. Keep me"
760,informed. That's one of them. Shot while trying to escape. 
761,"ZOE: Shot? Well, which one was it? The Highlander? "
762,"GORTON: No, but does it matter? "
763,"DOCTOR: Matter? Why, of course it matters! Shooting down prisoners?"
764,"Why, it's barbaric! "
765,GORTON: But they were trying to escape! 
766,"DOCTOR: Well, that's no excuse for murder! I want the other man brought"
767,here. 
768,GORTON: What for? 
769,DOCTOR: I'm not satisfied. I want to hear the prisoner's side of the
770,story. 
771,"(Jamie is dragged along by two guards, his feet not touching the"
772,"ground, and pushed into the kitchen.) "
773,JAMIE: Doctor! 
774,"DOCTOR: We'll see you get a doctor if you need one, my man. Right, let"
775,"him go. Commandant, dismiss your man. "
776,GORTON: Carry on. 
777,(The MP leaves.) 
778,JAMIE: What are you doing? 
779,"DOCTOR: Speak when you're spoken to! Now then, what's all this about"
780,trying to escape? 
781,JAMIE: What are you up to? 
782,DOCTOR: I'm not concerned with that! What about the other man you
783,escaped with? 
784,"JAMIE: Oh, he was shot in the leg, and they were going to shoot me,"
785,too. 
786,DOCTOR: I see. This is very serious. I shall have to make a full
787,report. 
788,GORTON: But they were trying to escape! My men had no alternative but
789,to shoot. 
790,DOCTOR: We'll see what General Smythe has to say about that 
791,. GORTON: Indeed we will! 
792,DOCTOR: What are you doing? 
793,GORTON: I'm going to telephone General Smythe. I've had about all I can
794,"take from you, sir. General Smythe. "
795,"DOCTOR: Ah, you'll regret this. The Minister "
796,"GORTON: I don't care two hoots about the Minister. Besides, I'm not"
797,"even sure you're from the War Office. Yes, where are your identity"
798,papers? 
799,DOCTOR: My identity papers? 
800,GORTON: I thought so. I thought there was a fishy story all along.
801,"Hello, is that "
802,(Zoe smashes a vase of flowers down onto Gorton's head.) 
803,"ZOE: I'm sorry, Doctor, but it seemed the only way. "
804,"DOCTOR: Oh, well done, Zoe. Yes, I think he'll survive. Right, come on."
805,Let's see if we can bluff our way out of here. 
806,"JAMIE: Yeah, but why were you kidding "
807,(Ransom enters with two MPs.) 
808,RANSOM: Going somewhere? Perhaps I can give you a lift?
809,
810, [British command post]
811,
812, BUCKINGHAM: General Smythe had made up his mind
813,those people were guilty. He wanted that man to be shot! 
814,CARSTAIRS: Perhaps he knew they were guilty? 
815,"BUCKINGHAM: Oh, you don't really believe that? "
816,"CARSTAIRS: No, I don't, but "
817,(Ransom enters.) 
818,"RANSOM: Well, we've got them. You'll never believe where we found them."
819,
820,CARSTAIRS: Where were they? 
821,"RANSOM: Well, I was on my way back here, I'd given up the search. It"
822,suddenly occurred to me I ought to go and tell Gorton about it. 
823,"BUCKINGHAM: Well, who's Gorton? "
824,RANSOM: He's the Commandant at the prison. Popped into his office and
825,there they were. 
826,CARSTAIRS: What were they doing there? 
827,"RANSOM: Do you know, that chap, he'd convinced old Gorton that he was a"
828,minister from Whitehall. And he'd nearly bluffed him into letting that
829,Scots lad go. I don't know I must say I admire his gall. It seems a
830,"pity, really, to have to shoot him. "
831,"CARSTAIRS: Sir, I'd like to speak to you, sir. The court martial wasn't"
832,in accordance with King's Regulations. 
833,RANSOM: What? 
834,CARSTAIRS: I'm not satisfied. 
835,"RANSOM: Oh don't be ridiculous, man, it's perfectly fair. General's a"
836,great stickler for that kind of thing. Sentence will be carried out as
837,"soon as he returns. Lady Jennifer, notify Command Post, will you? Let"
838,them know the hunt's over. 
839,"BUCKINGHAM: Yes, certainly. "
840,(Ransom leaves.) 
841,BUCKINGHAM: Do you see? He didn't remember what happened at the court
842,martial. 
843,CARSTAIRS: He really seems to believe they had a fair trial! 
844,BUCKINGHAM: The General wanted that man to be shot. Why? 
845,CARSTAIRS: I don't know. I think I'd better have a word with those
846,"civilians and try and find out. If Ransom comes back, keep him"
847,"occupied, will you? "
848,BUCKINGHAM: Right.
849,
850, [Wine cellar]
851,
852," DOCTOR: A redcoat, Jamie? "
853,"JAMIE: Aye, and he thinks he's in 1745. "
854,DOCTOR: But that's a complete anachronism. 
855,JAMIE: Aye. It's a what? 
856,DOCTOR: It's something out of it's own time. 
857,"ZOE: Yes, like the telecommunications unit in the General's room that I"
858,told you about. 
859,JAMIE: Eh? 
860,ZOE: I found it when I was looking for the key. 
861,DOCTOR: Both these things are in the wrong time. But what are they
862,doing here in 1917? 
863,JAMIE: Shush. 
864,"(Carstairs enters, revolver drawn.) "
865,CARSTAIRS: Close the door.
866,
867, [British command post]
868,
869," BUCKINGHAM: Yes Major, they were recaptured half"
870,an hour ago. Captain Ransom wanted me to let you know. Goodbye. I've
871,notified all the command posts. 
872,RANSOM: That's awfully kind of you. Has the General not returned yet? 
873,"BUCKINGHAM: No. Does he often disappear like this? I mean, surely he"
874,ought to keep you informed? 
875,"RANSOM: Well, he's a very busy man, you know. Where's young Carstairs? "
876,"BUCKINGHAM: Oh, he's gone to look for some transport. "
877,"RANSOM: Oh, good. I think I'd better go and make certain those"
878,prisoners are safely under lock and key. 
879,BUCKINGHAM: It must be very difficult working for someone like General
880,Smythe. 
881,"RANSOM: Yes, I suppose he is a bit of a martinet. He has a great deal"
882,"of responsibility, you know. "
883,"BUCKINGHAM: Oh yes, but a great deal falls upon your shoulders,"
884,Captain. 
885,"RANSOM: Yes, I suppose it is a job, running a place like this you know."
886,"Quite a problem. People don't understand. It's the paperwork, you see."
887,It's quite fantastic how many forms we have to fill in. Just look at
888,that.
889,
890,[Wine cellar]
891,
892, CARSTAIRS: What is a video screen? Some kind of
893,kinematograph? 
894,"ZOE: Oh, well, it's a bit more complicated than that. If only I could"
895,show it to you. 
896,"DOCTOR: If you'll take us to the General's room, we'll prove this thing"
897,exists! 
898,"CARSTAIRS: All right, you show it to me and I'll believe you. But you'd"
899,better be right.
900,
901, [British command post]
902,
903, BUCKINGHAM: I see! But how do you keep a track of
904,all the equipment? 
905,"RANSOM: Ah well, now that's the problem. I keep sending these"
906,"subalterns the forms, and they just don't fill them in. "
907,"BUCKINGHAM: But if they're at the front, fighting? "

909,"you know, in the last push we lost over one hundred shovels? "

914,"I. What, there with you now? Well, get rid of him, quickly!"

918," BUCKINGHAM: Yes, all right. I will. "
919,RANSOM: That for me? 
920,"BUCKINGHAM: Yes, all right. "
921,RANSOM: Who was there? 
922,BUCKINGHAM: The General. 
923,RANSOM: The General? 
924,BUCKINGHAM: He's at number seventeen command post and he'd like you to
925,join him there immediately. 
926,"RANSOM: Oh, right. Well, what's he doing there? That's the farthest"
927,"point of the sector! I'd better join him, I suppose. Jolly nice talking"
928,"to you. You know, not many women take an interest in the problems of"
929,supply. Goodbye. 
930,(Ransom leaves. The telephone rings.) 
931,"BUCKINGHAM: Yes? Yes, he's just gone. Oh. All right. "
932,(Buckingham goes to the window to watch a car drive away. Carstairs
933,"enters with the Doctor, Zoe and Jamie.) "
934,BUCKINGHAM: What on earth are you doing? 
935,"DOCTOR: There's no time to explain now. Now, where is this thing, Zoe? "
936,ZOE: It's over there. 
937,BUCKINGHAM: But that's the General's private room!

942,in. Zoe opens the portrait door to reveal the monitor.)

944,"CARSTAIRS: There's nothing there, only wall. "
945,DOCTOR: What? You mean you can't see that screen? 
946,BUCKINGHAM: What are we supposed to be looking at? 
947,"CARSTAIRS: Well, I still can't see anything. "
948,DOCTOR: Look at the wall! Concentrate! 
949,(Carstairs and Buckingham stare at the wood panelling until the dial
950,and monitor appear.) 
951,BUCKINGHAM: It is there. I can see it! 
952,DOCTOR: Can you see it yet? 
953,CARSTAIRS: Yes. But what's it for? 
954,"ZOE: Well, it's like a telephone, only you can see people as well as"
955,hear them. 
956,BUCKINGHAM: What's on the other end?
957,
958, [War room]

965, [Smythe's room]
966,

968,"DOCTOR: No, but somebody may have seen us. We've got to get away from"
969,"here, all of us. "
970,CARSTAIRS: Get away? Where do you hope to get to? 
971,"DOCTOR: Well, anywhere so long as it's away from here. "
972,"CARSTAIRS: I just can't let you go, just like that. "
973,"DOCTOR: Yes, you can. And you've got to come too. Your lives will be in"
974,"danger now, both of you. "
975,BUCKINGHAM: I think he's right. 
976,"DOCTOR: Now look, my friends and I are leaving here. Are you going to"
977,shoot us down? 
978,CARSTAIRS: All right. I'll believe you.
979,
980, [British command post]
981,
982, BUCKINGHAM: I'll get the ambulance. 
983,CARSTAIRS: Yes. I'll meet you by the front entrance. 
984,DOCTOR: So what do you want us to do? 
985,CARSTAIRS: Just clamber into the ambulance and keep quiet. I'm going to
986,"have to bluff our way past the sentries. Now, just wait here. I'll get"
987,some maps. 
988,(Carstairs leaves.) 
989,JAMIE: Are we going back to the Tardis now? 
990,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, we must stay here and see what is happening. "
991,"ZOE: We can't leave these people now, anyway. "
992,"JAMIE: No, I suppose not. "
993,"CARSTAIRS: Right, are you ready? Come on. "
994,"RANSOM: Carstairs, what's going on? "
995,"CARSTAIRS: Orders from the General, sir. He wants the prisoners taken"
996,to HQ immediately. 
997,RANSOM: Are you sure your message is genuine? 
998,"CARSTAIRS: Well, yes, sir, I spoke to the General personally. "
999,"RANSOM: Well, I don't know. I had a message to meet him at command post"
1000,seventeen. That was a fake. 
1001,"CARSTAIRS: Well, the General was most insistent, sir, but of course it"
1002,"is up to you, sir. "
1003,"RANSOM: Oh, you'd better carry on. "
1004,"CARSTAIRS: Very good, sir. All right, move off. Any trouble mind, I"
1005,won't hesitate to fire. 
1006,"RANSOM: Just a minute, Carstairs. "
1007,CARSTAIRS: Sir? 
1008,RANSOM: Where's Lady Jennifer? 
1009,"CARSTAIRS: She's somewhere around, sir. "
1010,RANSOM: Right.

1025,"RANSOM: Everything's all right, sir. They're on their way to"
1026,headquarters just as you ordered. 
1027,SMYTHE: I gave no such order! 
1028,"RANSOM: Well, they've just left with Lieutenant Carstairs, sir. "
1029,"SMYTHE: Ransom, you're a fool! Where's Lady Jennifer? "
1030,"RANSOM: I don't know, sir. She gave me a message to meet you at command"
1031,"post seventeen. (looks out of the window) The ambulance, sir, it's"
1032,gone. 
1033,"SMYTHE: Now we know what to look for. Well, issue a general order at"

1035,"RANSOM: Yes, sir. "
1036,(Whilst the ambulance trundles along a road.) 
1037,"RANSOM: Good, thank you. Ambulance spotted, sir. "
1038,SMYTHE: Where? 
1039,"RANSOM: Sector four, heading east, travelling very fast. I'll send out"
1040,a motorcycle patrol. 
1041,SMYTHE: No need for that. 
1042,"RANSOM: Well, sector four could cut them off. "
1043,"SMYTHE: Concentration of artillery there. Yes, that should reach them. "
1044,"RANSOM: We'll use artillery on an ambulance, sir? "
1045,"SMYTHE: That ambulance is in enemy hands, Ransom. "
1046,RANSOM: But there are two women on board. 
1047,(Smythe puts his spectacles on.) 
1048,SMYTHE: I want a creeping barrage laid along that road. Do you
1049,understand? Do you understand? 
1050,"RANSOM: Yes, I understand. "
1051,"SMYTHE: Good. Well, order the artillery to fire, then. "
1052,"RANSOM: A very good idea, sir. Creeping barrage. Stop them dead. "
1053,SMYTHE: That's just how we want them. Dead.

1059,"CARSTAIRS: Maps! Artillery barrage, and we're still seven miles from"
1060,the German line. 
1061,"DOCTOR: Well, perhaps it's not, perhaps it's not German artillery. "
1062,"CARSTAIRS: Well, our chaps wouldn't fire at us. "
1063,"DOCTOR: No, but General Smythe might! "
1064,"JAMIE: Whoever it is, his aim's getting better! "
1065,CARSTAIRS: Let's get out of here! Bring the rest of the maps.

1077,DOCTOR: What is it? 
1078,CARSTAIRS: Fog. Can't see. 
1079,"BUCKINGHAM: The mist, the gas! "
1080,DOCTOR: Gas? 
1081,"BUCKINGHAM: I can't go on, there's something stopping me. "
1082,"DOCTOR: It's not gas, go on. "
1083,BUCKINGHAM: I can't! 
1084,"DOCTOR: Well, move over. Let me, come on. "

1091,out and look around.) 
1092,JAMIE: That's more like it. 
1093,"ZOE: That mist, Doctor, what was it?Â "
1094,"DOCTOR: I don't know, Zoe. Some sort of force field. "
1095,ZOE: Where are we? There's no sign of the war here. 
1096,"JAMIE: Yes, and the guns have stopped, too. "
1097,"DOCTOR: Yes. It's odd, Jamie. "
1098,CARSTAIRS: Feeling better? 
1099,BUCKINGHAM: Yes. Thank you.
1100,
1101, [Hilltop]
1102,

1104,men shouting in the distance.)

1106,ZOE: What's that? 
1107,(A phalanx of warriors are heading towards them lead by a two horse

1112,(As the Romans plant their SPQR at the top of the

1122,
1123, (The ambulance engine catches and Carstairs gets
1124,in as Buckingham slowly backs the ambulance up the road and it fades
1125,away. When the Romans get there they just stop in mid yell.)

1128,
1129," ZOE: That was a close shave. Where are we, Doctor?"
1130,
1131,"JAMIE: Oh no, we're not back here again. "
1132,(Carstairs and Buckingham join them in the back.) 
1133,"DOCTOR: Ah, Lieutenant Carstairs, is this the only map you're supplied"
1134,with? 
1135,"CARSTAIRS: Yes, that's the one. "
1136,"DOCTOR: It's a bit inadequate, isn't it? "
1137,"BUCKINGHAM: Doctor, who were those people who attacked us just now? "
1138,"DOCTOR: Oh, they were Romans. "
1139,"CARSTAIRS: Oh, but that's impossible! "
1140,"DOCTOR: Oh, lots of impossible things happen when you pass through"
1141,time. 
1142,BUCKINGHAM: Time? But no one can alter time. 
1143,"DOCTOR: Look, it is 1917 where we are now on this map. Where we were"
1144,attacked by the Romans it is two thousand years ago. 
1145,"CARSTAIRS: But surely, Doctor "
1146,DOCTOR: Surely before we met the Romans we passed through a mist didn't
1147,"we? A gas you called it. Now, supposing this mist is a barrier between"
1148,different time zones? 
1149,ZOE: I see. So we went off the edge of this map and into a different
1150,time zone. 
1151,DOCTOR: Yes. What we need is a map which covers all the time zones. I'm
1152,"afraid we shall have to get back to General Smythe's headquarters, to"
1153,the chateau. 
1154,JAMIE: Well how are we going to get back there? 
1155,"DOCTOR: Well, that's easy. You will take us!"

1160,"(Jamie and the Doctor enter, followed by Carstairs.) "
1161,"CARSTAIRS: Lieutenant Carstairs reporting, sir. I brought back the"
1162,prisoners. 
1163,"RANSOM: Carstairs, what on earth have you been up to? And what do you"
1164,"mean by giving me that fake report from the General? I warn you,"
1165,"Carstairs, you're in very serious trouble! You're "
1166,(Carstairs points his revolver directly at Ransom.) 
1167,RANSOM: Have you gone mad? 
1168,"CARSTAIRS: I'm sorry about this, sir. "
1169,"RANSOM: You'll be shot for this, Carstairs! "
1170,"CARSTAIRS: Yes, sir. "
1171,(Jamie takes Ransom's gun.) 
1172,"CARSTAIRS: Don't do anything foolish, sir. I think it might be better"
1173,if you raised your hands. 
1174,(The Doctor rummages around for maps.) 
1175,"CARSTAIRS: Bandages, Doctor. "
1176,"DOCTOR: What? Oh, yes. I'm afraid that there's nothing here, only local"
1177,maps. Here we are. Perhaps there's something in the General's room.
1178,I'll go and see. 
1179,RANSOM: This is mutiny. I hope you 
1180,(Jamie stuffs a handkerchief into Ransom's mouth and fastens it there
1181,with a bandage.)
1182,
1183, [Smythe's room]
1184,
1185, (The Doctor enters and looks around.) 
1186,CARSTAIRS: Find anything? 
1187,"DOCTOR: Well, only this safe. "
1188,CARSTAIRS: The only way to get inside that is to blow it up. 
1189,"DOCTOR: Oh, what a good idea. "
1190,CARSTAIRS: You serious? 
1191,"DOCTOR: Well, this is a military establishment, there must be some"
1192,explosives around here. 
1193,CARSTAIRS: Right. I'll see what I can find. 
1194,DOCTOR: Good. 
1195,(Carstairs leaves.) 
1196,"DOCTOR: Jamie, I wonder whether perhaps I can pick this lock. "
1197,"JAMIE: Aye, with a tuning fork? "
1198,"(While Ransom is trussed up on the settee, Carstairs opens boxes and"
1199,crates in the drawing room.) 
1200,"JAMIE: Oh come on, Doctor, we haven't got all night. Someone's bound to"
1201,turn up. 
1202,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know, Jamie. Oh dear, this is useless. "
1203,(Carstairs enters with a hand-sized device.) 
1204,JAMIE: What's that thing? 
1205,CARSTAIRS: It's a Mills bomb. It's all I could find. I thought we might
1206,hang it on the front of the safe and let it off. 
1207,"DOCTOR: Oh, well, yes, that might blow the room up very nicely, but I"
1208,don't think it would affect the safe much. You see we have to
1209,concentrate the 
1210,(The Doctor is fiddling with the primitive grenade.) 
1211,CARSTAIRS: Look out! 
1212,DOCTOR: Whole explosion into the lock there. 
1213,CARSTAIRS: Blow us all up. 
1214,"DOCTOR: Now then, if I can pack the explosive into the lock and then"
1215,"detonate it. Ah, here we are. Now then. Ah yes, I see. "
1216,"CARSTAIRS: For goodness sake, be careful. That's Amatol in there. "
1217,"DOCTOR: It's all right. I do have the detonator, you know. Now then,"
1218,just release this. There we are. Now what have we got? Oh yes. 
1219,(The Doctor pours the explosive powder onto a piece of paper.) 
1220,"DOCTOR: This fuse, how long does it last? "
1221,CARSTAIRS: About four seconds. 
1222,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's not very good, is it? "
1223,"(The Doctor looks for a longer fuse, briefly considering on of the"
1224,tassels on Jamie's best sporran. He settles for breaking a candle and
1225,using its wick. He inserts it carefully into the safe lock.) 
1226,DOCTOR: There we are. 
1227,RANSOM : Help! Help!
1228,

1235,CRANE: Hello. 
1236,CARSTAIRS: Dropped my pen. 
1237,CRANE: Ah. Captain Ransom about? 
1238,"CARSTAIRS: No, I'm looking after things. Can I help? "
1239,"CRANE: Well, it's a bit tricky, actually. The sentry found these two"
1240,ladies hiding in an ambulance. 
1241,CARSTAIRS: Well? What about it? 
1242,"CRANE: Well, you remember there was this spy flap earlier today."
1243,Something about them getting away in an ambulance and one of them was a
1244,"woman. I don't think we've met before, have we?"

1246, [Smythe's room]
1247,
1248, (Jamie strikes a match and they hide behind
1249,Smythe's camp bed. The Doctor covers his head with a pillow.)

1252,
1253, BUCKINGHAM: This is all completely ridiculous! 
1254,"CARSTAIRS: Really, old chap, you can leave them to me. I'm sure we can"
1255,sort it out. 
1256,CRANE: But don't you think I ought to wait for Captain Ransom? 
1257,CARSTAIRS: He may be quite some time. 
1258,CRANE: I can wait. How long do you say you've been on attachment here?
1259,
1260, [Smythe's room]

1263,CARSTAIRS : About three months.

1269,It's quite under control. 
1270,"CRANE: Oh well, right you are. Sorry about all this. Do hope you"
1271,"understand. Can't afford to take chances, you see. "
1272,ZOE: We quite understand.
1273,
1274, [Smythe's room]
1275,
1276,CRANE : Perhaps you could stay for dinner. We
1277,don't often see ladies here. The chaps in the mess would be delighted. 
1278,"BUCKINGHAM : Sorry, but we really have to be on our way. "

1294,"DOCTOR: Ah yes. Here we are, Jamie. "
1295,"CRANE: You're Carstairs, the one who went off with the spies! "
1296,CARSTAIRS: Come on!

1298,off in triangles. Zoe enters.) 
1299,"DOCTOR: Look, Zoe. 1917 zone, Roman zone, American Civil War zone. This"
1300,whole place is divided into time zones. 
1301,ZOE: But there's a blank space in the middle. There's nothing marked at
1302,all. 
1303,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, and I think that that's where we've got to get to. "

1324,"Besides, he's safe in the ambulance with Jennifer. "
1325,"JAMIE: Aye, for how long though? "

1380,"LÃCKE: Ach, so. Now tell me, when? "
1381,JAMIE: In seventeen forty five. I was fighting the Redcoats. 
1382,LÃCKE: You were fighting the Redcoats in seventeen forty five? That
1383,"ambulance, was it going to a hospital or to a lunatic asylum? "
1384,"DOCTOR: Oh, dear. Look, look, I can prove to you that we come from"
1385,"another time. This is a sonic screwdriver. Now, where can I"
1386,"demonstrate? Ah, that revolver will do. It's all right. "
1387,(Lucke places his weapon on the table and the Doctor unscrews the hand

1547,"SMYTHE: Ah, but I will use my reinforcements to turn your flank. There!"

1610,"DOCTOR: Well, there is an answer to that, but I hope, I just hope. "

1612,(Zoe takes a pair of plastic visors with + eye holes from a shelf.)

1629,"DOCTOR: No, we'd only land up right in the middle of another war. "
1630,"ZOE: Well, then, what are we going to do? "
1631,DOCTOR: Well this thing must eventually go back to its base. That's
1632,where we've got to get to.

1653,BUCKINGHAM: What are you going to do to us? 
1654,"THOMSON: Now that's up to the General. But when we leave here, you're"
1655,coming with us. 
1656,"RILEY: And the General, he doesn't take kindly to spies. He shoots 'em!"
1657,
1658,BUCKINGHAM: This is disgraceful. We are neutral civilians.

1701,WAR CHIEF: That five percent is causing us endless trouble. 
1702,SCIENTIST: What harm can they do?

1704,building up everywhere. 
1705,SCIENTIST: But five percent? So few of them cause you trouble? 
1706,WAR CHIEF: Their numbers are growing all the time. If ever they band
1707,"together in one organised group, they could cause enough trouble to"
1708,upset the major plan. The process must be improved. 
1709,SCIENTIST: It already has been. I am hoping to give a first
1710,demonstration to the students very shortly.

1785,VON WEICH: You're going to tell me where they're making for.

1787,VON WEICH: You're from the Resistance. 
1788,"HARPER: That's right, and I'm not one of you. Listen, you all. You're"

1807,are keyhole shaped.) 
1808,"ZOE: We've passed a reception area, living quarters, lecture rooms."
1809,It's just like a university. 
1810,"DOCTOR: Yes, a sort of training school, but for what? "
1811,ZOE: Shush. 
1812,(Three soldiers from different eras walk past.) 
1813,ZOE: Why didn't they take any notice of us? Because of the glasses? 
1814,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. Come on, let's see what else we can find. "
1815,"GUARD: You two, in! "
1816,DOCTOR: Well we were just 
1817,GUARD: In here! You're late.

1822,
1823," SCIENTIST: Should you arrive on another planet,"
1824,you may not be aware that the problem is to retain the specimen's
1825,personality as a fighting man while at the same time putting him under
1826,"our control. As you know, we remove the human specimens from their own"
1827,"world and time, and place them in a context which seems to them to be"
1828,the same. It is vital that they continue to believe that they are
1829,living their own lives on the planet Earth and fighting the wars from
1830,which they were taken. 
1831,ZOE: So this isn't Earth. 
1832,"DOCTOR: Quite right, Zoe, quite right. "
1833,"SCIENTIST: With the majority of human specimens, the process used is"
1834,"both lasting and effective. However, in the case of certain humans of"
1835,"particularly strong character and individuality, the effects of the"
1836,process have not been permanent. Gradually the processing tended to
1837,fade and the specimens developed the ability to pass through the Time
1838,Zone Barriers. Some formed themselves into resistance groups which have
1839,considerably hampered the progress of our plan. It is to overcome this
1840,problem that I have further refined our processing technique. To
1841,demonstrate the process I chosen a particularly difficult specimen. A
1842,"man who finally shook off the effects of the process completely, and"
1843,allied himself to resistance elements in order to fight us. 
1844,(Guards bring out a gurney on which Carstairs is strapped.) 
1845,"SCIENTIST: This Lieutenant Carstairs is a 1917 British army officer,"
1846,"who for some time after his initial processing, believed himself to be"
1847,"fighting for his country. However as I shall now demonstrate, the"
1848,process has completely lapsed and he is now fully conscious of his
1849,surroundings. Where are you? 
1850,CARSTAIRS: I don't know. 
1851,SCIENTIST: Describe what you can see. 
1852,CARSTAIRS: A room. Filled with a lot of scientific mumbo jumbo. Funny
1853,"people, strange clothes and those sort of glasses that you're wearing. "
1854,(The Doctor gestures Carstairs to keep quiet.) 
1855,"SCIENTIST: As you see, he is fully aware of his surroundings and very"
1856,"hostile. After my new technique has been applied, he will not only be"
1857,"completely docile, but will be fully convinced that whatever I tell him"
1858,will be the truth. 
1859,(The Scientist clamps Carstair's in a metal vice-like device and turns
1860,it on.) 
1861,"ZOE: Oh, can't we help him? "
1862,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, not yet. Later. "
1863,"SCIENTIST: This machine is, of course, only a prototype. In due course,"
1864,"other machines will be built to this pattern, capable of processing"
1865,large groups of specimens simultaneously. 
1866,(The machine finishes its cycle.)

1876,General. 
1877,"CARSTAIRS: Yes, sir. I'm in the General's office. "
1878,"SCIENTIST: As you see, whatever he sees he transforms into something he"
1879,"can understand. Now, what is this? "
1880,"CARSTAIRS: What, sir? "
1881,SCIENTIST: This. 
1882,"CARSTAIRS: I'm sorry, sir, there's nothing there. "
1883,"SCIENTIST: Objects which are beyond his comprehension, he will not see"
1884,"at all. Now, who are these people? "

1901,(Carstairs is wheeled away.) 
1902,SCIENTIST: I'll examine him later. 
1903,"DOCTOR: Well, I don't think much of that as a demonstration. "
1904,SCIENTIST: Will you kindly return to your place?Â 
1905,DOCTOR: The man was obviously unhinged as a result of your experiment. 
1906,SCIENTIST: The experiment was successful. 
1907,DOCTOR: Then why did he call me a German spy? It's obviously
1908,"ridiculous, isn't it. "
1909,SCIENTIST: The aberration is only temporary. He was probably involved
1910,with tracking down some German spies before he came here. It has
1911,obviously become a fixation. 
1912,"DOCTOR: Huh. Then he's obviously no use for our purposes, is he. "
1913,(The Doctor opens up the brain-washing apparatus.) 
1914,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, just as I thought. This is your trouble, you know. "
1915,SCIENTIST: Will you leave this apparatus alone? 
1916,"DOCTOR: Yes, this circuit is overloading the neural paths. "
1917,SCIENTIST: You are here in the capacity of a student. 
1918,"DOCTOR: You didn't de-process that man first, did you. "
1919,SCIENTIST: There was no need. His processing had completely lapsed. You
1920,saw that for yourself. 
1921,DOCTOR: I saw a man whose processing had partly lapsed. You should have
1922,"completely de-processed him first, but I don't suppose you can do that"
1923,on a machine like this. 
1924,SCIENTIST: Of course we can. It is simply a case of reprogramming these
1925,circuits here. 
1926,DOCTOR: What there?

1939,HARPER: You see those guys over there? They think they're fighting the
1940,war between the States. This isn't even America.

1945,"some other war, some other place. "
1946,BUCKINGHAM: How long have you realised this? 
1947,HARPER: I started noticing things quite a while back. Then I found some
1948,other guys who are the same.

2205, WAR CHIEF: Did she identify her friends? 
2206,"SECURITY CHIEF: No, they are not on our files of resistance people. "
2207,WAR CHIEF: Then they must be a small independent group. 
2208,"SECURITY CHIEF: Yes, five of them. First reported in the 1917 Time"
2209,"Zone. One has been caught and is being reprocessed, two believed still"
2210,at large in the American Civil War Zone. 
2211,WAR CHIEF: And one still at large in this control. 
2212,SECURITY CHIEF: He will be caught. 
2213,WAR CHIEF: He's evaded your security guards so far. Perhaps he will
2214,continue to do so? From which time does she originate? 
2215,SECURITY CHIEF: She was a nurse like the other girl. 1917. 
2216,WAR CHIEF: And the man? 
2217,"SECURITY CHIEF: The same, 1917. "
2218,WAR CHIEF: Why did they come here? 
2219,SECURITY CHIEF: They had some confused idea they were getting home. 
2220,WAR CHIEF: She told you nothing else? Everything quite straightforward?
2221,
2222,SECURITY CHIEF: Yes. The normal pattern of resistance activity. did you
2223,expect something else? 
2224,TECHNICIAN: Emergency call from the American Civil War Zone sir. 
2225,WAR CHIEF: What's wrong? 
2226,"TECHNICIAN: The signal was activated, but there was no message, no"
2227,contact at all. 
2228,"WAR CHIEF: All right, I'll deal with it. Come with me. "
2229,SECURITY CHIEF: But the girl. 
2230,WAR CHIEF: She can wait.

2235,Carstairs come out of hiding.)

2239, [Security section]
2240,
2241," DOCTOR: Zoe, what have they done to you? Don't you"
2242,"point that thing at me! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, treating a"
2243,poor young girl like 
2244,(The Doctor walks round the guard so that Carstairs can come up behind
2245,him and knock him out.) 
2246,"DOCTOR: Oh, well done. "
2247,(The Doctor waves his smelling salts under Zoe's nose.) 
2248,"DOCTOR: There we are. Now, are you feeling better? "
2249,ZOE: Oh my head! What happened? 
2250,DOCTOR: That's was just the question I was going to ask you. What did
2251,happen? 
2252,"ZOE: They questioned me. Someone came in, put on that strange headset"
2253,and questioned me. 
2254,"DOCTOR: Let's have a look. Oh yes, it's a very interesting little"
2255,gadget. 
2256,ZOE: I saw pictures of people. 
2257,"DOCTOR: Really? Oh, well, let's try it, shall we? "
2258,(The Doctor puts the interrogation helmet on.) 
2259,"DOCTOR: Now then, where does this switch? Oh yes, oh, with a slight"
2260,adjustment 
2261,(Pictures of Russell and Harper flicker back and forth.) 
2262,DOCTOR: There we are. Yes. What questions did they ask you about these
2263,"people, Zoe? "
2264,ZOE: He was talking about the resistance. At first he seemed to think I
2265,was one of them. 
2266,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, the resistance, of course. Yes. That's the American"
2267,"Civil War. The 1914-18 war. Yes, it's all recorded here. Scattered"
2268,groups of resistance. 
2269,(The Doctor takes the helmet off.) 
2270,"DOCTOR: Now if we could organise. Zoe, can you remember all the details"
2271,"about the resistance from that thing? Names, faces, Time Zones and so"
2272,on? 
2273,"ZOE: Yes, of course I can. "
2274,DOCTOR: Good. Then we can return to the Time Zones and organise the
2275,resistance into one big army! That way they'll have a better chance. 
2276,CARSTAIRS: But how do we get back? 
2277,"DOCTOR: Well, that's simple. The way we came. Come on. "
2278,"ZOE: Oh Doctor, are you sure?"
2279,
2280, [Central Control]
2281,
2282," TECHNICIAN: Still no message sir, just the"
2283,emergency signal. 
2284,WAR CHIEF: Well? This is your sphere of responsibility. 
2285,(War Chief leaves.) 
2286,SECURITY CHIEF: Arrange transportation for guards. 
2287,"TECHNICIAN: Central control to Landing Bay, transportation required for"
2288,security guards. 
2289,SECURITY CHIEF: Security squad to report to Landing Bay immediately.

2293," (An alarm goes off and the Doctor, Zoe and"
2294,Carstairs hide as three rubber-suited guards march through with
2295,weapons.) 
2296,ZOE: What was all that about? 
2297,"DOCTOR: I don't know, but they're going to the landing bay. Come on. "
2298,(The trio watch as the guards go into a SIDRAT and it dematerialises.)

2301,
2302, HARPER: I've posted sentries all around. If they
2303,"should send in any troops, our outposts will warn us. "
2304,RUSSELL: Good. 
2305,BUCKINGHAM: What if they send one of those things the Doctor went off
2306,in? 
2307,"JAMIE: Aye, that's what they'll do. Then they can attack us from"
2308,inside. 
2309,RUSSELL: They've got to get inside first. 
2310,JAMIE: No you don't understand. 
2311,(Materialisation sound.) 
2312,"JAMIE: Quick, hide! In here, Lady Jennifer. "
2313,(A SIDRAT appears. Two of the guards come out. Harper approaches them
2314,"and they use their weapons on him. He falls, staring at nothing. The"
2315,rest of the resistance grab the guards from behind.) 
2316,SOLDIER: Hold it there! 
2317,"JAMIE: Well, we dealt with those all right, didn't we? "
2318,(Russell takes one of the weapons and goes over to where Harper is
2319,lying.) 
2320,RUSSELL: There's not a mark on him. But he's dead. But what are these
2321,"things, how do they work? "
2322,"JAMIE: Hey, careful! "
2323,RUSSELL: They don't work. 
2324,"JAMIE: Aye, well, you probably have to do something very special with"
2325,them. 
2326,RUSSELL: Your green box machine. 
2327,"JAMIE: Aye, just what we need."
2328,
2329, [War room]
2330,
2331, SECURITY CHIEF: This emergency call could be
2332,resistance activity. There is a large group operating in the American
2333,Civil War Zone. 
2334,"WAR CHIEF: There seem to be large groups operating in most Zones, and"
2335,now they're even infiltrating here. 
2336,SECURITY CHIEF: Only two of them and one of those has already been
2337,caught. 
2338,"WAR CHIEF: Had I not pointed them out, you wouldn't have even known"
2339,they were here. 
2340,"SECURITY CHIEF: Yes, that has been puzzling me. Just how did you"
2341,recognise them? 
2342,WAR CHIEF: You dare cross-question me?! The security of this entire
2343,venture is being threatened by your incompetence. You will find this
2344,intruder! 
2345,SECURITY CHIEF: The whole base is being searched. It is only a matter
2346,of time. If the mental processing were fully effective 
2347,WAR CHIEF: There would be no need for security. When I came to your
2348,people I was promised efficiency and cooperation. Without the knowledge
2349,"I have, this complete venture would be impossible. "
2350,SECURITY CHIEF: We have given you every facility. If you have
2351,complaints I suggest you take them to the War Lord. 
2352,WAR CHIEF: I intend to do so. And now I suggest you finish the
2353,interrogation of that girl before she escapes as well.

2358,guard.) 
2359,"SECURITY CHIEF: Where is the girl? You fool, where is she?!"
2360,
2361, [Barn]
2362,
2363," JAMIE: Do you not see, though? This thing could"
2364,take us all back to the place where it's controlled from! 
2365,RUSSELL: How do you know? 
2366,"JAMIE: Oh, where do you think those two came from? "
2367,"RUSSELL: Well, is it true? Answer me. "
2368,VON WEICH: Do you think I'd help you? 
2369,RUSSELL: You'll do as you're told. Take those two away. 
2370,"JAMIE: Now look, you want to find out what's going on, don't you? Och,"
2371,I can't wait for you to make up your mind! 
2372,"BUCKINGHAM: Oh, wait for me. "
2373,"JAMIE: Ah, now, Lady Jennifer, I don't think you should come. "
2374,BUCKINGHAM: Because I'm a woman? 
2375,"JAMIE: No, er, well, in a way, yes. "
2376,BUCKINGHAM: That settles it then. I'm certainly coming. You can't go
2377,alone. 
2378,"RUSSELL: No, you're right, miss, he can't. I'm going with him. But"
2379,you're staying here. 
2380,"BUCKINGHAM: Oh now, look here! "
2381,"RUSSELL: You're a nurse, you said? "
2382,"BUCKINGHAM: Yes, but what's that got to do with it? "
2383,RUSSELL: I've got hundreds of injured men back at my headquarters. They
2384,need the help of someone like you. 
2385,"BUCKINGHAM: Yes, I suppose you're right. Tell Lieutenant Carstairs"
2386,"that. Well, tell him I'll see him when you all get back. "
2387,JAMIE: Right. 
2388,BUCKINGHAM: Good luck. 
2389,"JAMIE: Oh, thank you. "
2390,"RUSSELL: Take her back to our headquarters. Thank you, Miss. "
2391,(Buckingham leaves. Russell goes over to Von Weich.) 
2392,"RUSSELL: You. Guard him. If he gives you any trouble, shoot him. You"
2393,"two, you're coming with me. Come on, move! "
2394,JAMIE : Door's closing! 
2395,RUSSELL: Quick! Come on!

2399, (The Security Chief releases the Scientist from
2400,the brain-washing machine.) 
2401,SECURITY CHIEF: What happened? 
2402,SCIENTIST: That young officer got away. 
2403,SECURITY CHIEF: How? 
2404,"SCIENTIST: Oh, the one in the lecture who asked all the questions, he"
2405,tricked me. I must report this to the War Chief. 
2406,"SECURITY CHIEF: No! You two, wait outside. "
2407,(The guards leave.) 
2408,SCIENTIST: But he must be informed. 
2409,SECURITY CHIEF: These people are no ordinary resistance group. The girl
2410,said they have the secret of space time travel. 
2411,SCIENTIST: That's impossible. 
2412,SECURITY CHIEF: She was under the truth machine. 
2413,SCIENTIST: But the War Chief. He's the only one who understands space
2414,time travel. 
2415,SECURITY CHIEF: And his people. 
2416,SCIENTIST: What are you suggesting? 
2417,SECURITY CHIEF: He is not one of our race. Who knows where his true
2418,loyalties lie? 
2419,SCIENTIST: But he came to us of his own accord. 
2420,SECURITY CHIEF: He is a traitor to his own people. How can we be sure
2421,he is not a traitor to us?
2422,
2423, [War room]
2424,
2425, TECHNICIAN: Transportation returning from the
2426,"American Civil War Zone, sir. "
2427,WAR CHIEF: Good. 
2428,"TECHNICIAN: But they're not following the routine, sir. They haven't"
2429,called in. 
2430,WAR CHIEF: Have you tried to make contact? 
2431,"TECHNICIAN: Yes, sir. "
2432,"WAR CHIEF: All right, inform the Security Chief. No! No, I'll handle"
2433,this myself. This is the War Chief to Security section. All guards to
2434,landing bay. The following procedure will be carried out
2435,

2437,
2438,"(The Doctor, Zoe and Carstairs are hiding behind"
2439,the control panel.) 
2440,"ZOE: How long have we got to wait here, Doctor? "
2441,DOCTOR: Until one of those things arrives. If I can get inside I'm sure
2442,I can control it. 
2443,CARSTAIRS: The alarm signal. They've probably found that guard. 
2444,DOCTOR: The light's flashing. That means an arrival. 
2445,(A troop of guards enter and line up.) 
2446,ZOE: It looks as though somebody important's coming. 
2447,(The guards aim their weapons at the materialising SIDRAT. The door
2448,"opens and Jamie creeps holding a revolver, followed by Russell and an"
2449,assortment of nationalities.) 
2450,ZOE: It's an ambush!

2457,"DOCTOR: No, there's nothing we can do. "
2458,CARSTAIRS: We must get away from here. 
2459,ZOE: But we can't. Jamie. We can't. 
2460,CARSTAIRS: Do you want us all to get killed? Go on!

2465," ZOE: Oh Doctor, what about Jamie? Have they killed"
2466,him? 
2467,DOCTOR: I don't know! 
2468,CARSTAIRS: Let's go this way. 
2469,"DOCTOR: No, no, this way to the processing room. "
2470,CARSTAIRS: Why do you want to go to the processing room? 
2471,"DOCTOR: Don't ask questions, just follow me. "
2472,ZOE: Oh!
2473,
2474, [Security section]
2475,
2476, SECURITY CHIEF: I believe that amongst this
2477,resistance group that attacked the base are people who have arrived on
2478,this planet without being brought here by us. 
2479,SCIENTIST: That's impossible! 
2480,"SECURITY CHIEF: Is it? What about the girl Zoe, and this man the Doctor"
2481,she spoke of? She said he had a space time travel machine. 
2482,"SCIENTIST: Yes I know, but "
2483,SECURITY CHIEF: Have we taken humans from later than the Earth year
2484,1917? 
2485,SCIENTIST: Of course not. Greater technological knowledge would be
2486,dangerous. 
2487,SECURITY CHIEF: Yet this man who tricked you had sufficient
2488,technological knowledge to understand the mental processing machinery. 
2489,"SCIENTIST: Yes, that's true. But how could these people get here? "
2490,SECURITY CHIEF: The War Chief. His people have the secret of time
2491,travel. 
2492,"SCIENTIST: Are you suggesting he's bringing in his own people, the Time"
2493,Lords? 
2494,SECURITY CHIEF: He came to us because he wanted power. Perhaps there
2495,are others of his people who feel the same. 
2496,"SCIENTIST: Can you prove this? If so, you must tell the War Lord"
2497,immediately. 
2498,SECURITY CHIEF: Unfortunately I have no proof. You must help me find
2499,proof. I insist. This is a matter of security. 
2500,"SCIENTIST: All right, what do you want me to do? "
2501,"SECURITY CHIEF: These resistance people. Before you reprocess them,"
2502,study them carefully. If you find anything unusual send the prisoner
2503,concerned to me for questioning.

2508,DOCTOR: We've got to get in there. 
2509,CARSTAIRS: Why? 
2510,"DOCTOR: Now that room, the other side. That must've been next door."
2511,"Yes, come on. "
2512,CARSTAIRS: Now what's he up to? 
2513,"ZOE: I've no idea, but I think we'd better follow. Come on."

2518,"through hanging racks of greatcoats, to the wall adjoining the"
2519,processing room.) 
2520,"DOCTOR: Some sort of preformed plastic, wouldn't you say, Zoe? "
2521,"ZOE: Yes, but why are you so interested in it, Doctor? "
2522,"DOCTOR: Little bits of metal imbedded in it. Yes, I think these panels"
2523,must be held together by some kind of magnetic forcefield. Now if I
2524,"could reverse that field. Cut me off some pieces of tape, will you"
2525,"please, Zoe? "
2526,ZOE: Oh yes. 
2527,"DOCTOR: That's right. One there, that's right. And one just there. "

2540," CARSTAIRS: Doctor, what on Earth are you doing? "
2541,"DOCTOR: Well, it's no secret, boy, it's simply a case of reversing the"
2542,magnetic field of this panel. 
2543,"ZOE: Doctor, why don't you use your sonic screwdriver as a power"
2544,source? 
2545,"DOCTOR: What a good idea, yes. "
2546,ZOE: There's just one thing though. 
2547,DOCTOR: Yes? 
2548,ZOE: All these panels are interlinked. 
2549,"DOCTOR: Yes, well? "
2550,"ZOE: Well, if you take one away what's to stop all the rest down like a"
2551,pack of cards? 
2552,"DOCTOR: Well, we'll just have to take that risk, won't we? Now then,"
2553,stand well clear. 
2554,(The Doctor attaches his sonic screwdriver to one end of the final long
2555,wire linking all the rest. The panel glows briefly.)

2557,DOCTOR: Watch. 
2558,(The Doctor gently removes the panel and sets it down so they look in
2559,through a gap over the top. Jamie is being placed on the examination
2560,table.) 
2561,ZOE: It's Jamie! He's alive! 
2562,DOCTOR: I hoped he might be. 
2563,ZOE: But how? They shot him down.

2570,a regular pattern of oblongs instead of a swirly brain-like one.)

2572,questioning.
2573,
2574, [Clothing store]

2576," ZOE: Doctor, why are they taking him away? "
2577,DOCTOR: I think they've possibly discovered that he was never
2578,processed. 
2579,"CARSTAIRS: We'd better get him out of there, then. "
2580,"DOCTOR: No, no, wait."
2581,

2589,enterprise. They may make future leaders. 
2590,WAR CHIEF: Where is this prisoner being taken? 
2591,"SCIENTIST: Oh, the Security Chief. He wants to question one of them"
2592,before reprocessing. 
2593,WAR CHIEF: Really? Why this one in particular? 
2594,"SCIENTIST: Oh, he just seemed to be the most suitable. "
2595,WAR CHIEF: For what reason? For what reason! 
2596,SCIENTIST: His brain patterns are different. 
2597,WAR CHIEF: Different how? 
2598,"SCIENTIST: Well, he appears not to have been processed before. "
2599,"WAR CHIEF: Really? How interesting. All right, carry on. (The guards"

2660,SECURITY CHIEF: It's possible. 
2661,WAR CHIEF: It's a fact! Why was I not informed? 
2662,SECURITY CHIEF: This is a matter of security. Security is my
2663,"responsibility, as you often remind me. "
2664,WAR CHIEF: Your first responsibility is to me. 
2665,SECURITY CHIEF: No! My first responsibility is to the War Lord and to
2666,my people. 
2667,"WAR CHIEF: You don't trust me. But if you question my loyalty, tell the"
2668,"War Lord. But I warn you, be absolutely sure of your suspicions because"

2679,DOCTOR: We're your friends. 
2680,"CARSTAIRS: You'll have to hurry it up, Doctor. "
2681,RUSSELL: Doctor? You must be the one that Jamie was talking about.
2682,Where is he? 
2683,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm afraid that they've taken him away. Now, up you get. "
2684,"CARSTAIRS: Doctor, we're wasting time. "
2685,(A guard comes past the open door to the central area and Carstairs
2686,shoots him.) 
2687,"CARSTAIRS: Come on, Doctor, we must get out of here! "
2688,"DOCTOR: Quickly through the gap in the wall here, Zoe, help him. "
2689,ZOE: Yes. 
2690,(The Doctor tries to take the brain washing machine off its stand.) 
2691,"CARSTAIRS: Come on, Doctor. "

2704,whole disgraceful business. 
2705,RUSSELL: Just the people I want to get my hands on. 
2706,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's not quite as simple as that. There are rather a lot"
2707,of them. 
2708,RUSSELL: I don't care how many of them there are! 
2709,DOCTOR: They have rather sophisticated weapons. You wouldn't stand a
2710,chance. 
2711,RUSSELL: Oh. So what do we do now? 
2712,DOCTOR: We're going to return to the time zones and organise the
2713,resistance into one big army! 
2714,RUSSELL: If you can find them. They're spread all over the place. I've
2715,"been trying to link them up myself, but it's finding them and you don't"
2716,know who you can trust. 
2717,"DOCTOR: Ah yes, we do now. My friend Zoe has memorised an entire list"
2718,of the resistance and their whereabouts. 
2719,"ZOE: Yes, I memorised the files when I was in the security room. "
2720,DOCTOR: Now I must get you all back to the landing bay.

2850,SECURITY CHIEF: You knew they would head for the landing bay. You knew
2851,one of them could operate our machines. 
2852,"WAR CHIEF: Of course. That is, after all, how they got here. Logic"

3036,(A technician leaves. A man in black with the War Chief and an armed

3046,rectified? 
3047,"WAR CHIEF: Your scientists did get effective machines, but "
3048,WAR LORD: But what? 
3049,"WAR CHIEF: Unfortunately, it was removed by an intruding party of"
3050,resistance men. 
3051,WAR LORD: They penetrated the control area? They just walked in? How? 
3052,"SECURITY CHIEF: I have the situation under control, War Lord. It is"
3053,only a matter of time before they are recaptured. 
3054,WAR LORD: Then I hope that time is on your side.

3072,the time zone barrier. Our processed Roman legions won't be able to
3073,follow them there. 
3074,SECURITY CHIEF: Then we will send in my security guards from the
3075,control centre. 
3076,"WAR CHIEF: No, not again. We are carrying out a delicately controlled"
3077,operation. The presence of guards in the time zones could stretch he
3078,credulity of the processed humans. It would be most dangerous. 
3079,SECURITY CHIEF: It will be even more dangerous if we allow this Doctor
3080,to remain alive. 
3081,WAR CHIEF: Have you looked for this space time machine of theirs? 
3082,SECURITY CHIEF: What use is that to us? 
3083,WAR CHIEF: They will no doubt try to return to it. That's where we
3084,should be looking for them. It's a simple enough conclusion. You might
3085,even have reached it yourself. 
3086,SECURITY CHIEF: I have reached a number of conclusions about you and
3087,"about this man, the Doctor. "
3088,WAR CHIEF: Indeed? Then perhaps you'd like to share them with us? 
3089,SECURITY CHIEF: This Doctor arrived here on this planet we have chosen
3090,for the war games. He brought with him companions who have not been
3091,subjected to our mental processing. 
3092,WAR CHIEF: A fact you tried to conceal. 
3093,SECURITY CHIEF: They came in a space time machine. The secret of space
3094,time travel is known only to you and to your people. 
3095,WAR CHIEF: And I brought that secret here. 
3096,"SECURITY CHIEF: You have shown us how to operate these machines, but"
3097,not how to construct them. These people were summoned by one who is in
3098,"league with his own kind, plotting to betray us! "
3099,WAR CHIEF: You cannot produce one single atom of proof! 
3100,SECURITY CHIEF: The accumulation of evidence is overwhelming! 
3101,"WAR LORD: That's enough! That's enough from both of you. Now, I am"
3102,tired of this eternal bickering. Your inability to work together is
3103,endangering our whole plan. You have a choice. Co-operate or be
3104,replaced.

3109,"Lieutenant Carstairs, do you feel all right? "
3110,"CARSTAIRS: Perfectly, why? "
3111,"DOCTOR: Oh, good. That means the processing machine is working all"
3112,right. 
3113,"JAMIE: Oh, where do we go from now, Doctor? "
3114,"DOCTOR: Just follow me, Jamie. "

3124,spotted answering to the descriptions of the two spies and the officer
3125,"wanted for desertion, sir. "
3126,SMYTHE: Map? 
3127,"BURNS: They'd be just about, er, here, sir. "

3144, SMYTHE: You've caused me a great deal of trouble. 
3145,"DOCTOR: Good, I'm very glad to hear it. I suppose you're going to"
3146,subject us to another one of your farcical courts martial? 
3147,"SMYTHE: In your case, that won't be necessary. You have already been"
3148,condemned to death. 
3149,DOCTOR: And what about my friends? 
3150,"SMYTHE: They will be given the chance to redeem themselves, in the most"
3151,dangerous sector of the front line. 
3152,"DOCTOR: After some more of your mental processing, I suppose? "
3153,SMYTHE: They will have the opportunity of making the supreme sacrifice
3154,for their King and country. 
3155,CARSTAIRS: You can drop all that nonsense. We know what's going on. 
3156,"SMYTHE: Do you, Carstairs? "
3157,CARSTAIRS: Yes. This isn't the war. We're not even on our own planet.
3158,"Do you realise that, Sergeant Major? This General of yours isn't even a"
3159,human being. 
3160,(Smythe puts on his spectacles.)

3164,"CARSTAIRS: Listen to me, Sergeant Major! "
3165,"SMYTHE: It's no use, Carstairs. Nothing you say will have any effect."
3166,"Sergeant Major, prepare a firing squad. "

3170,SMYTHE: I don't need any authority. 
3171,DOCTOR: Your alien superiors will want to question me. 
3172,SMYTHE: You've caused me a great deal of trouble and embarrassment.
3173,"Now, I'm afraid, you're going to pay for it with your life! "
3174,DOCTOR: So you're simply being malicious! 
3175,SMYTHE: Revenge can be very satisfying. 
3176,"BURNS: Firing party ready, sir! "

3262,WAR CHIEF: And the Doctor is still alive. Smythe was a fool. He
3263,deserved to die. 
3264,WAR LORD: The Doctor has the processing machine. Does he have the
3265,knowledge and the ability to use it? 
3266,WAR CHIEF: Yes. I think he has. 
3267,"WAR LORD: Then the situation's urgent, isn't it? Fortunately, they're"
3268,in a very vulnerable position now. If they've made a mass attack then
3269,"all their forces are concentrated in one position, the chateau. "
3270,SECURITY CHIEF: This time we must use the guards. 
3271,"WAR CHIEF: No, we will invalidate the experiment. If they are"
3272,"concentrated in this one place, it would be simple enough to wipe them"
3273,out with an artillery barrage. 
3274,"WAR LORD: Simple, but just as foolish as using the security guards. A"
3275,violent attack on the Chateau would almost certainly destroy the
3276,"control units there. The time zone barriers would disappear. No, use"
3277,the conventional forces. Could be quite amusing. A mass attack on the
3278,chateau. A pincer movement with our little band of heroes caught in

3299,CARSTAIRS: Yeah. 
3300,"DOCTOR: Mister Russell, how long can you hold on here? "
3301,"RUSSELL: Well, not long, Doctor. Our forward position's about to fall"
3302,back already. 
3303,"DOCTOR: Well, you must hold on as long as you can. I think I've got the"
3304,"answer. You see, we have to have a safe base from which to fight these"

3373,"JAMIE: Aye, a mist. "
3374,DOCTOR: Yes. I've set up a time zone barrier all round the chateau. 
3375,RUSSELL: So none of the processed people will be able to get at us. 
3376,"DOCTOR: Exactly, but your people can come and go just as you please. At"

3391,WAR LORD: The Security Chief is right. You have failed. And your
3392,leadership of the security forces has hardly been spectacularly

3555,"RUSSELL: It's all right, panic's over. Zoe, you'd better get a hurry"
3556,"with those resistance names, if you would. "
3557,ZOE: Right. 
3558,JAMIE: What're you going to do then? 
3559,RUSSELL: We've got to round them all up. Get them here for a meeting. 
3560,"JAMIE: Oh, let's go then. "
3561,"RUSSELL: Not you, Jamie. "
3562,JAMIE: Eh?

3571,your mind will only last for fifteen minutes. Thirty if you are lucky.
3572,"Now, admit that the War Chief sent for you! "
3573,WAR CHIEF: Are you trying to kill him? 
3574,(Security Chief turns off the probe and the Doctor relaxes.) 
3575,SECURITY CHIEF: I am trying to get the truth out of him. 
3576,WAR CHIEF: You'll never make him talk that way. 
3577,SECURITY CHIEF: You are very sure. 
3578,WAR CHIEF: He is one of my own race. Your truth machine cannot work on
3579,us if we choose to resist. 
3580,SECURITY CHIEF: You admit it then. You do know him. 
3581,WAR CHIEF: Of course I do. And only I can deal with him. Release him. 
3582,SECURITY CHIEF: He is my prisoner. 
3583,WAR CHIEF: But I am your superior. 
3584,(The Security Chief releases the Doctor's wrists from the chair.) 
3585,WAR CHIEF: You and I are going to talk alone.

3588,(The Doctor is taken out.)

3591,methods of my own. 
3592,(The War Chief leaves. The Security Chief goes over to his control
3593,desk.)

3604,"DOCTOR: Oh, do you? "
3605,WAR CHIEF: Your machine is a Tardis. You're too familiar with it's
3606,controls to be a stranger. 
3607,DOCTOR: I had every right to leave. 
3608,"WAR CHIEF: Stealing a Tardis? Oh, I'm not criticising you. We are two"
3609,of a kind. 
3610,DOCTOR: We most certainly are not! 
3611,WAR CHIEF: We were both Time Lords and we both decided to leave our
3612,race. 
3613,DOCTOR: I had reasons of my own. 
3614,WAR CHIEF: Just as I had. 
3615,DOCTOR: Your reasons are only too obvious. Power! 
3616,WAR CHIEF: How much have you learnt of our plans? 
3617,DOCTOR: I know that you've been kidnapping soldiers from the Earth from
3618,various times in it's history and bringing them here to kill one
3619,another. 
3620,WAR CHIEF: But do you realise our ultimate objectives? 
3621,DOCTOR: No objective can justify such slaughter. 
3622,WAR CHIEF: The war games on this planet are simply the means to an end.
3623,The aliens intend to conquer the entire galaxy. A thousand inhabited
3624,worlds. 
3625,"DOCTOR: Yes, but why choose the people of the Earth? "
3626,WAR CHIEF: They are the most suitable recruits for our armies. Man is
3627,the most vicious species of all. 
3628,"DOCTOR: Well, that simply isn't true. "
3629,WAR CHIEF: Consider their history. For a half a million years they have
3630,been systematically killing each other. Now we can turn this savagery
3631,"to some purpose. We can bring peace to the galaxy, and you can help."
3632,"You see, I'm not the cold-hearted villain you suppose me to be. My"

3658,they've surrounded the headquarters. 
3659,JAMIE: Has he now? I'll soon sort him out. 
3660,"ZOE: Oh Jamie, no! They'd shoot you as soon as look at you. "
3661,JAMIE: Eh? I thought he was supposed to be on our side? 
3662,"ZOE: Well, he is. Well, I mean, he will be if we can persuade him to"
3663,join us. 
3664,"JAMIE: Well, didn't you explain to him? "
3665,"ZOE: Yes, I tried, but he wouldn't listen. He's got rather primitive"
3666,ideas about women knowing their place. 
3667,"JAMIE: Has he now? Oh, sounds a nice chap. "
3668,"ZOE: Jamie, this is no laughing matter. We've got to persuade him to"

3671,"ZOE: No, not to me, but. Quickly over here, I've got an idea. "

3689,"you plan to take over my territory, huh? "
3690,"JAMIE: Oh, no, no. No, it's nothing like that, no. "

3693,"VILLAR: And when you have this strength, what do you do with it? "
3694,"JAMIE: Ah, do with it. Aye. "
3695,ZOE: We attack the aliens that brought everybody here. 
3696,JAMIE: We attack them all together in force!

3701,"JAMIE: Well, why not? Only if she's right, of course. "

3706,VILLAR: We are free men. We do anything we want to.

3710,"ZOE: Oh, but you can. "
3711,VILLAR: How? 
3712,ZOE: The same way you all came here. But first we've got to defeat the
3713,people that run everything. They have a stronghold. 
3714,VILLAR: I have heard. It is impossible to get in there. 
3715,"ZOE: Well, we have been there, and if we can get a big enough army"

3724,DOCTOR: But why make them kill each other? 
3725,WAR CHIEF: How else can we find the most disciplined and courageous
3726,fighters? 
3727,DOCTOR: You have given these aliens our science and our knowledge to
3728,carry out this disgusting plan. 
3729,"WAR CHIEF: We are going to bring a new order to the galaxy, one United"

3738,WAR CHIEF: I know this man. He is a fugitive from the Time Lords. 
3739,SECURITY CHIEF: As you are. 
3740,"WAR CHIEF: That's right, as I am. "
3741,WAR LORD: Did you bring him here? 
3742,"WAR CHIEF: No, he arrived by chance. "
3743,WAR LORD: Did the Time Lords send you? 
3744,DOCTOR: No. 
3745,WAR LORD: Have you informed them? 
3746,WAR CHIEF: He dare not. That would betray him. 
3747,SECURITY CHIEF: He has allied himself with the resistance and has
3748,organised them against us. He must die. 
3749,WAR CHIEF: No! He has agreed to help us destroy the resistance. He will
3750,cooperate. He has no alternative. 
3751,SECURITY CHIEF: He should be killed now. We cannot trust him. 
3752,WAR LORD: If he helps us destroy the resistance. If. His life will be
3753,spared. 
3754,SECURITY CHIEF: War Lord. 
3755,WAR CHIEF: I have decided. (to War Chief) I hold you responsible for

3758,DOCTOR: I never promised to help you! 
3759,WAR CHIEF: But you will. You have no alternative. 
3760,DOCTOR: But to help people like that to conquer the galaxy?

3769,resistance groups together before. 
3770,"VILLAR: You bring everyone together in one place, you know what"
3771,happens? The enemy will go pow! We are all killed. 
3772,"PETROV: What he says makes sense. Alone, we annoy them a little,"
3773,"together, we wipe them out. "
3774,JAMIE: That's exactly what the Doctor says. 
3775,"CARSTAIRS: Look, we should get together a large body of men. Armed,"
3776,"disciplined. And then, and only then can we strike at their"
3777,headquarters. 
3778,VILLAR: How do we get there? 
3779,ZOE: We use one of their own space time machines. 
3780,"VILLAR: Ah, these little boxes you talk about, holding thousands of"
3781,men. Fairy stories! 
3782,PETROV: I have seen one. I have seen soldiers come out of them. Whole
3783,regiments. 
3784,"CARSTAIRS: You see, SeÃ±or Villar? We're not talking nonsense. "
3785,VILLAR: These magic boxes. Where do we get one? 
3786,ZOE: They have certain landing points in each time zone. That room over
3787,"there, that's one of them. "
3788,VILLAR: How you get a whole army in here? The place is surrounded. It's
3789,hard enough for one man at a time to get in. 
3790,"CARSTAIRS: Yes, quite right. We must use one of the other places. "
3791,"JAMIE: Well, what about that American barn where we met Mister Russell?"
3792,
3793,"CARSTAIRS: Yes, that's er, that's here. (points to map) Is that all"
3794,right for everybody? 
3795,"PETROV: Khorosho! I know that place. Much forest, easy to hide men. "
3796,"CARSTAIRS: Well, we're agreed then. You all gather your groups here,"
3797,and we make a concerted attack on the enemy. 
3798,VILLAR: And what if he make a concerted attack on us? 
3799,"CARSTAIRS: Oh, he's going to be far too busy to do that. "

3864,SECURITY CHIEF: There are now very few left to send. 
3865,WAR CHIEF: That's exactly what they wanted. Have any of the guards
3866,returned? 
3867,SECURITY CHIEF: No. 
3868,WAR CHIEF: So you've left the base weakened for a possible mass attack.
3869,
3870,WAR LORD: Is that true? 
3871,SECURITY CHIEF: I know where their attack is coming from. A
3872,communications unit was activated in the American Civil War Zone.

3874,scattered all over the War Zones? 
3875,SECURITY CHIEF: The neutron bomb. 
3876,WAR CHIEF: That would wipe out the processed humans. We would have to
3877,evacuate the planet. 
3878,WAR LORD: The resistance army must be crushed once and for all. 
3879,SECURITY CHIEF: So we shall use the neutron bomb? 
3880,"WAR LORD: No, we shall attempt to be rather more subtle than that, (to"

3979,Remote control? In my day these things were impossible to achieve
3980,without shortening the life of the time control units. 
3981,WAR CHIEF: There have been many advances made in space time technology.
3982,
3983,"DOCTOR: Yes, there must have been. That particular problem is"
3984,impossible to solve. How did you solve it? 
3985,WAR CHIEF: It's not a thing one can explain in a few words. We'll
3986,discuss it later. Now we really should join the War Lord. 
3987,"DOCTOR: You haven't solved it, have you? Your machines have a limited"
3988,life span. Sooner or later they're going to be useless. 
3989,"WAR CHIEF: Very well. Yes, you're right. "
3990,"DOCTOR: Now I understand. It's my Tardis that you're after, isn't it? "
3991,"WAR CHIEF: Exactly! When we are in control, the machines I have brought"
3992,with me will have expired. If we hold the only space time travel
3993,"machine, we can rule our galaxy without fear of opposition. "
3994,"DOCTOR: Yes, but without me and my Tardis your ambitions are going to"
3995,"be rather hard to realise, aren't they? "
3996,"WAR CHIEF: That's right. And without my influence, these aliens will"
3997,surely kill you.

4000,
4001," RUSSELL: Well, a fine mess your friend the Doctor"
4002,"got us in, eh? I'll break his neck when I get my hands on him. "
4003,"CARSTAIRS: Oh, I don't believe it. "
4004,"JAMIE: Look, he must have had a good reason. "
4005,"VILLAR: To have us killed, maybe, to save his own skin. When I get my"
4006,hands on him I kill him too! 
4007,"JAMIE: Now look, the Doctor wouldn't betray us. "
4008,"ZOE: No, of course, he wouldn't! Why did he get us to come here?"
4009,
4010, [War room]
4011,
4012, WAR LORD: He seems to have done very well. We have
4013,"the leaders of the resistance, and the immediate threat to the war"
4014,games is over. But your sudden decision to join us worries me. 
4015,"DOCTOR: Well, I like to be on the winning side. "
4016,WAR LORD: Previously you thought the resistance to be the winning side.
4017,What made you change your mind? 
4018,"DOCTOR: Well, I hadn't realised how small and weak their groups were"
4019,compared with your might and power. 
4020,"WAR LORD: You have a silver tongue, just like your friend the War"
4021,Chief. What contribution can you make to our plan? 
4022,"DOCTOR: Well, your processing machines. I can make them work more"
4023,effectively. 
4024,WAR LORD: Our scientist is at this moment producing new machines on the
4025,home planet. 
4026,"DOCTOR: Ah yes, but that will take time. I can make the old ones work"
4027,just as well. Probably better. 
4028,WAR LORD: Very well. You shall have the opportunity to prove your
4029,ability. You will adjust the machines and reprocess your resistance
4030,friends. 
4031,DOCTOR: They are no longer my friends. They are our enemies. 
4032,WAR LORD: Of course they are. Take him to the processing room. See he
4033,has every facility. 
4034,(The Doctor and Security Chief leave with guards.) 
4035,"WAR LORD: The resistance groups, where are they? "
4036,WAR CHIEF: They are all now concentrated in this one area. I have
4037,ordered the conventional troops to move in on them. 
4038,WAR LORD: Good. When the situation returns to normal order all the
4039,security guards to return to the control centre. All control points on
4040,"the planet are to be repaired, and the war games recommenced. "
4041,WAR CHIEF: Are you returning to the home planet?Â 
4042,WAR LORD: No. I'm waiting until the emergency is over. You will inform
4043,me immediately if there's any change in the situation.
4044,
4045, [Processing room]
4046,
4047, ZOE: What are they making us wait here for? 
4048,CARSTAIRS: Probably going to reprocess us again. 
4049,JAMIE: Eh? 
4050,"CARSTAIRS: Brainwash us, send us back to fight. "
4051,"RUSSELL: No, I doubt it. They know their processing machines don't work"
4052,on us. 
4053,VILLAR: They will shoot us. What else do you do with prisoners? 
4054,SECURITY CHIEF: Your friend the Doctor has a better idea. He is going
4055,to adjust the machines and re-process you himself. 
4056,JAMIE: He wouldn't do that! 
4057,"ZOE: Doctor, you can't! "
4058,RUSSELL: You just try it! 
4059,SECURITY CHIEF: I don't think they like you. Unfortunately I cannot
4060,"spare any of my guards to protect you, so you will have to fend for"
4061,yourself. 
4062,DOCTOR: What? But you 
4063,(The Security Chief leaves with the guards.) 
4064,"RUSSELL: Well, well, well. It seems your new friends don't like you"
4065,either. 
4066,VILLAR: Leave him to me. I kill him first. 
4067,"DOCTOR: No. No! Don't come any closer, no!"
4068,
4069, [War room]
4070,
4071, SECURITY CHIEF: How is the battle progressing? 
4072,WAR CHIEF: The resistance group were all concentrated in this one area.
4073,We have them completely encircled. 
4074,SECURITY CHIEF: And now you will destroy them? 
4075,"WAR CHIEF: Of course. They are falling into disorder, naturally enough"
4076,since we have their leaders here. Has the Doctor started processing
4077,them? 
4078,SECURITY CHIEF: Not yet. 
4079,WAR CHIEF: Why not? 
4080,SECURITY CHIEF: Where is the War Lord? 
4081,WAR CHIEF: You did take the Doctor to the processing room? 
4082,SECURITY CHIEF: Of course. 
4083,WAR CHIEF: I don't trust you. 
4084,SECURITY CHIEF: The feeling is mutual. 
4085,(The War Chief leaves.) 
4086,SECURITY CHIEF: Play back the recordings.
4087,
4088, [Processing room]
4089,
4090, (The Doctor is being mobbed.) 
4091,"DOCTOR: Oh no, leave me alone! "
4092,CARSTAIRS: Leave him be! 
4093,JAMIE: Now look! Just give him a chance to speak! 
4094,"RUSSELL: Yes, we listened to him once before and look where it got us."
4095,He led us into a trap! 
4096,"DOCTOR: They were going to drop a neutron bomb! You'd all be dead now,"
4097,"and all of your resistance friends with you, if it wasn't for me. "
4098,VILLAR: He's lying. 
4099,RUSSELL: You did a deal to save your own neck. 
4100,VILLAR: But your deal didn't do you no good. They turn you over to us
4101,and now we kill you. 
4102,"CARSTAIRS: No, you can't just murder him. "
4103,"VILLAR: Is not murder, is execution. "
4104,CARSTAIRS: Have you got any explanation for your conduct? 
4105,"DOCTOR: Yes, I am trying to save your lives! If you do exactly as I"
4106,tell you'll be all right. 
4107,VILLAR: We don't listen to your lies no more. 
4108,(Villar gets away from Carstairs and starts choking the Doctor. The War
4109,Chief and his guards break it up.) 
4110,"WAR CHIEF: I'm sorry, Doctor. There seems to have been some kind of"
4111,misunderstanding. 
4112,"DOCTOR: Yes, and it was very nearly fatal."
4113,
4114, [War room]
4115,
4116," WAR CHIEF : Doctor, this is also a matter of"
4117,your own survival. Unless I can convince the War Lord that you will
4118,help us 
4119,SECURITY CHIEF: Stop! Wind further on. Now! Try there. 
4120,WAR LORD : Responsible for the success of the plan. Failure will
4121,mean death. For both of you. 
4122,DOCTOR : I never promised to help you! 
4123,WAR CHIEF : But you will. You have no alternative. 
4124,DOCTOR : To help people like that gain control of the galaxy? 
4125,"WAR CHIEF : Not people like that, people like us. I will take over"
4126,"as Supreme Galactic Ruler. You can help me rule, if you will cooperate."
4127,
4128,SECURITY CHIEF: Enough! I knew it.
4129,
4130, [Processing room]
4131,
4132, (Jamie is in the brainwashing machine.) 
4133,WAR CHIEF: Are you sure this new process will be completely effective? 
4134,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, quite sure. I think that will do. There we are. Now"
4135,"then, when this young man comes to, he will believe himself to be"
4136,fighting the English Redcoats in 1745. Now get up! 
4137,JAMIE: Eh? Oh. 
4138,DOCTOR: What is your name? 
4139,JAMIE: Eh? 
4140,DOCTOR: Your name. 
4141,"JAMIE: Ah, James Robert McCrimmon. "
4142,DOCTOR: Do you know where you are? 
4143,"JAMIE: Er well, I "
4144,"DOCTOR: You are in my castle. I am the McCrimmon of McCrimmon, your"
4145,hereditary Chieftain. 
4146,"JAMIE: Yes, of course. You're the Chieftain. Who's that? "
4147,"DOCTOR: Well, that is a friendly chieftain. You will obey his orders as"
4148,you will mine. 
4149,"JAMIE: Oh aye, I'll obey you. "
4150,"DOCTOR: There you are, you see? Complete loyalty and devotion. I can do"
4151,the same with all the other resistance people that you capture. 
4152,WAR CHIEF: Excellent. Continue with the others. If you can successfully
4153,"process characters like these, you will have made an immense"
4154,contribution. 
4155,(The War Chief leaves.) 
4156,DOCTOR: Thank you. Bring the girl! 
4157,"ZOE: Oh, leave me alone. Don't! "
4158,"(The guards bring Zoe, and Jamie helps sit her down.) "
4159,"JAMIE: Look, do as you're told. "
4160,DOCTOR: You will obey us. It is for your own good. (wink)
4161,
4162, [War room]
4163,
4164, WAR CHIEF: What a stupid fool you are. You
4165,deliberately disobeyed the War Lord's orders. Arrest him. Arrest him! 
4166,SECURITY CHIEF: You are no longer in command. 
4167,WAR CHIEF : I will take over as Supreme Galactic Ruler. You can
4168,"help me rule, if you will cooperate. "
4169,SECURITY CHIEF: I had all discussion that took place between you and
4170,"the Doctor recorded. What a stupid fool you are. Guards, take him to"
4171,"the security bay! Collect his accomplice, the Doctor, on the way. If"
4172,"they offer any resistance, shoot them both!"
4173,
4174, [Processing room]
4175,
4176, (Villar has been processed.) 
4177,"DOCTOR: There we are. Now then, sit up, sit up! Now then, you are in la"
4178,"Castille de la Cruz de San Antonio de la Frada Forma, in Mexico. "
4179,VILLAR: Eh? Are you crazy? You machine is no good! Villar is too strong
4180,for you! 
4181,(Villar starts throttling the Doctor.) 
4182,DOCTOR: Stop! Get him off me! 
4183,"(Carstairs and the others tackle the guards who come to his aid, then"
4184,Jamie gets Villar off the Doctor.) 
4185,"JAMIE: Can you not pretend like the rest of us, you great loon? "
4186,VILLAR: Is all a trick? 
4187,JAMIE: Aye. 
4188,VILLAR: You fix the machine so she don't work? 
4189,"DOCTOR: Yes. I fix her, and you nearly fixed me. "
4190,VILLAR: And you only pretend to be loco? 
4191,JAMIE: Exactly! 
4192,"RUSSELL: But Doctor, why did you get us here at all? "
4193,DOCTOR: They were going to drop the neutron bomb. You were better alive
4194,here than dead out there. 
4195,"CARSTAIRS: Zoe, watch the door, will you? "
4196,ZOE: Right. 
4197,"CARSTAIRS: Doctor, now we're here, surely we can take over? "
4198,RUSSELL: It depends upon how many of those guards they've got. 
4199,"CARSTAIRS: Ah, but we've been drawing them out to the Time Zones. "
4200,"DOCTOR: Yes, very successfully from what I hear. "
4201,"ZOE: Doctor, somebody's coming. Three of them are heading this way. "
4202,(The War Chief is marched in under guard. The fighters take out the
4203,guards.) 
4204,DOCTOR: Don't harm him. We may need him. 
4205,WAR CHIEF: It seems my trust in you was a little misplaced. 
4206,"DOCTOR: Did you really think I'd take part in your disgusting, stealing"
4207,scheme? 
4208,WAR CHIEF: Why not? You must have been a little tempted by the thought
4209,of being the ruler of an entire galaxy. 
4210,VILLAR: All this talk! When we fight? 
4211,RUSSELL: We haven't got anything to fight with. We've no guns. 
4212,CARSTAIRS: We've got those alien guns if we can work out how to use
4213,them. 
4214,"VILLAR: I no trust those things. I need my guns, they good guns, never"
4215,miss. 
4216,"RUSSELL: Well, he knows where they're stored. "
4217,WAR CHIEF: I might. 
4218,"RUSSELL: You'd better, because I'm "
4219,DOCTOR: I'm sure that the War Chief is going to cooperate. He's going
4220,to help us gain control of the War Room. 
4221,"WAR CHIEF: That may not be so easy. You see, our little arrangement had"
4222,been discovered. I was under arrest. 
4223,RUSSELL: Oh yes? 
4224,"CARSTAIRS: Yes, that could be right. He did come in here under"
4225,gunpoint. 
4226,WAR CHIEF: But the personnel in the landing bay are not aware of my
4227,"arrest. When the security guards return from the Time Zones, you won't"
4228,stand a chance. I can stop the arrival of the time machines. 
4229,"DOCTOR: I see. Very well, but first you'll take us to the War Room."
4230,You're the only one that can stop the fighting in the Zones. 
4231,"VILLAR: Hey, wait a minute! First we get our guns, no? "
4232,"DOCTOR: No. I mean, yes. Come along, Jamie, Zoe."
4233,
4234, [War room]
4235,
4236, SECURITY CHIEF: I want a blanket broadcast to all
4237,security guards in the War Zones. This is the Security Chief. The
4238,resistance groups are scattered over the Civil War Zone. They will be
4239,dealt with later. All security guards will now proceed to the nearest
4240,"control point, there are "
4241,(The resistance rushes in.) 
4242,SECURITY CHIEF: Guards! 
4243,"(Two more guards enter, and Villar shoots them.) "
4244,"VILLAR: I told you, my guns best! "
4245,SECURITY CHIEF: Emergency alarm! 
4246,(The technician hits the alarm then gets shot. The Security Chief tries
4247,"to sneak to a weapons rack, and the War Chief takes him down with one"
4248,of the sonic weapons. Jamie and Carstairs point their guns at him.) 
4249,WAR CHIEF: It's all right. It was a personal debt I had to settle. 
4250,(The War Chief hands over the weapon.) 
4251,DOCTOR: Will somebody turn off that hideous noise? I cannot think! 
4252,"ZOE: There's one thing I don't understand, Doctor. How are you going to"
4253,get all these people back to their own time? 
4254,"DOCTOR: Yes, I've been thinking about that. "
4255,WAR CHIEF: You realise that we have very little time now the alarm has
4256,been sounded? 
4257,DOCTOR: Yes. Call off the fighting at once! 
4258,"WAR CHIEF: We could just go to the landing bay, order a machine and"
4259,leave. 
4260,"DOCTOR: You could, we can't. The fighting has to be stopped and"
4261,everyone sent back to their own times. 
4262,WAR CHIEF: Sent back? How? 
4263,"DOCTOR: By your Tardis travel machines, of course. "
4264,WAR CHIEF: I'm afraid that will not be possible. There are only two
4265,machines left with enough life in them. 
4266,"DOCTOR: What? But, oh my word, well that's happened rather sooner than"
4267,I expected. 
4268,"RUSSELL: Doctor, does that mean that you can't do as you promised and"
4269,get us all home? 
4270,"DOCTOR: Oh, well, yes, I "
4271,WAR CHIEF: You can't. 
4272,DOCTOR: I can still do that. 
4273,"WAR CHIEF: You can't, unless. Doctor, you mustn't call them in or it"
4274,will be the end of us. They'll show no mercy. 
4275,DOCTOR: You stop the fighting! 
4276,RUSSELL: Do as you're told! 
4277,WAR CHIEF: This is the War Chief to all War Zones. This is a command
4278,"direct from the War Lord. All fighting will cease. I repeat, all"
4279,fighting in the War Zones will cease. You will stand by for further
4280,orders. 
4281,"ZOE: What did he mean, Doctor? Who mustn't you call? "
4282,DOCTOR: The only people who can put an end to this whole ghastly
4283,business and send everyone back to their own times. The Time Lords. 
4284,JAMIE: Who are they? 
4285,"DOCTOR: They're my own people, Jamie. "
4286,"JAMIE: Oh, well, that's all right, then. "
4287,"ZOE: But it isn't all right, is it, Doctor. "
4288,"DOCTOR: No, it's not, Zoe. But I'm afraid that there's no alternative. "
4289,(The Doctor sits on the floor and puts six plastic squares in a circle
4290,in front of him. Then he closes his eyes and concentrates.) 
4291,JAMIE: What's he doing? 
4292,"WAR CHIEF: Don't do it, Doctor. You can't! You know what will happen! "
4293,(The squares form themselves into a cube.) 
4294,JAMIE: Look at that! 
4295,CARSTAIRS: That's fantastic. 
4296,VILLAR: Is magic! 
4297,"ZOE: Doctor, are you all right? "
4298,"DOCTOR: Yes, Zoe, I'm all right. "
4299,"JAMIE: Doctor, what's that?Â "
4300,"DOCTOR: It's a box, Jamie. "
4301,JAMIE: I know. I can see that. 
4302,DOCTOR: It's a very special sort of box. It now contains all the
4303,"information about what's been going on here, and an appeal for help. "
4304,JAMIE: Help? Who from? 
4305,ZOE: The Time Lords? 
4306,"DOCTOR: Yes, Zoe. "
4307,"JAMIE: Well, why haven't you asked them for help before? "
4308,"DOCTOR: I've never really needed it before, Jamie, but this business of"
4309,"sending everyone back to their own times is, well, it's too difficult"
4310,for me. 
4311,(The Doctor puts the cube in his pocket.) 
4312,"DOCTOR: Now, come along. The War Chief! "
4313,CARSTAIRS: What? 
4314,DOCTOR: He's gone! 
4315,RUSSELL: What? 
4316,DOCTOR: He must be trying to get away before the Time Lords get here! 
4317,"CARSTAIRS: Well, what are we going to do, Doctor? "
4318,DOCTOR: We must go to the landing bay and stop him.
4319,
4320, [SIDRAT landing bay]
4321,
4322, (The War Chief runs in and summons a SIDRAT. But
4323,before he can get inside he is stopped by guards.) 
4324,WAR CHIEF: I thought 
4325,WAR LORD: Yes? 
4326,WAR CHIEF: You've arrived just in time. There's been a revolt. The
4327,prisoners have escaped. How many guards do you have? 
4328,WAR LORD: Only the ones you see here. 
4329,WAR CHIEF: Then we must return to the home planet to bring
4330,reinforcements. 
4331,WAR LORD: Where is the Security Chief? 
4332,WAR CHIEF: The prisoners have taken over the War Room. They've killed
4333,him. 
4334,"WAR LORD: No, no, you killed him, but a little too late. I heard the"
4335,recording. 
4336,"WAR CHIEF: He wanted to stop the War Games. He was a incompetent fool,"
4337,jealous of my position. Surely you realise that? He forged that
4338,recording you heard. 
4339,(The War Chief runs for the exit but guards block him.) 
4340,WAR CHIEF: He wanted to stop the war games! He tried 
4341,WAR LORD: Kill him! 
4342, [Central area]
4343,
4344, (The War Chief's screams can be heard.) 
4345,"CARSTAIRS: Doctor! Doctor, that came from the landing bay! "
4346,"DOCTOR: Yes, but they won't be expecting us. Come on."
4347,
4348, [SIDRAT landing bay]
4349,
4350, WAR LORD: Remove the traitor's carcass. We will
4351,return to the home planet and bring back an army to quell this revolt
4352,once and for all. 
4353,(The guards take the War Chief's body to one side while the War Lord
4354,adjusts the SIDRAT control panel.) 
4355,VILLAR: Viva el Villar! 
4356,"(Villar starts shooting, and the other fighters join in from the other"
4357,side of the bay. Jamie goes hand to hand with a remaining guard.) 
4358,"VILLAR: Out of the way, I shoot the dog! "
4359,(Carstairs deals with the other surviving guard as Russell helps Jamie.
4360,Villar goes to the War Lord.) 
4361,VILLAR: I kill him too! 
4362,"DOCTOR: No, no, that won't be necessary. We'll leave him for the Time"
4363,Lords to dispose of. 
4364,"RUSSELL: When will they be here, Doctor? "
4365,DOCTOR: I'm going to send for them now. And I want you all to stay here
4366,and wait until they come. 
4367,RUSSELL: But what are you going to do? 
4368,"DOCTOR: Well, I cannot stay here. Jamie, Zoe, this is where we say"
4369,goodbye. 
4370,JAMIE: What are you talking about? 
4371,"DOCTOR: Well, the Time Lords will return you home. "
4372,ZOE: But why can't we stay with you? 
4373,"DOCTOR: Because when I send this box to them, they'll know where I am. "
4374,"JAMIE: But I thought they were your people, your friends? "
4375,"DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, they are my people, but. Oh, it'd take too long to"
4376,explain. I have to go! 
4377,"JAMIE: Now look, if you're going to be in trouble, you'll need me to"
4378,look after you. 
4379,"ZOE: Me, too. "
4380,JAMIE: Aye. 
4381,"DOCTOR: But you don't understand! Oh, very well, but don't say I didn't"
4382,"warn you. Right then, we must return to the 1917 Zone and find the"
4383,"Tardis, and make good our escape. "
4384,"CARSTAIRS: Doctor, can I come back there with you? I'd rather like to"
4385,try and find Lady Jennifer. 
4386,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, very well. "
4387,"(The Doctor gets a SIDRAT ready, then sits on the floor and"
4388,concentrates. The box vanishes.) 
4389,"DOCTOR: Well, goodbye, gentlemen. I'm sorry, but we must rush. "
4390,VILLAR: You leave us? 
4391,"RUSSELL: Yes, what about us? "
4392,DOCTOR: The Time Lords will return you home. Now come along. 
4393,"VILLAR: No! No one is going anywhere. This Doctor, he cheat us. We"
4394,rescue him and now he leave us here to die. 
4395,"RUSSELL: Yes, it's only fair, Doctor! If these Time Lords are friends"
4396,"of yours, why don't you wait for them to arrive? "
4397,"DOCTOR: But you don't understand, Mister Russell. I must go. Please! "
4398,"VILLAR: You stay here with us, my friend. "
4399,"DOCTOR: Look, I am not going to argue. Jamie, Zoe, Carstairs, into the"
4400,machine. 
4401,"JAMIE: Ah but Doctor, look, he's not joking, you know. "
4402,"DOCTOR: For once, Jamie, do as you are told! "
4403,VILLAR: You move and I kill you! 
4404,"DOCTOR: Then you will just have to kill me, Mister Villar. "
4405,"VILLAR: Well Mister Doctor, that is just what I will do! "
4406,(The Doctor goes into the SIDRAT after Jamie and Zoe. Carstairs and
4407,"Russell grab Villar to stop him shooting the Doctor, then Carstairs"
4408,enters the SIDRAT.) 
4409,"VILLAR: Let me go, I kill him! "
4410,"RUSSELL: You can't shoot him in the back, he's done too much for us. "
4411,"VILLAR: Ah, the back, the front, what's the difference? "
4412,"RUSSELL: It's too late now, anyway. "
4413,(The SIDRAT dematerialises.) 
4414,"WAR LORD: Don't worry. When the Time Lords get him, he'll wish you had"
4415,killed him. 
4416,(A strange sound fills the room.) 
4417,WAR LORD: They're coming.
4418,
4419, [No Man's Land]
4420,
4421, CARSTAIRS: Fighting's stopped. 
4422,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, goodbye, Lieutenant. "
4423,JAMIE: Eh? 
4424,DOCTOR: There's the Tardis. We've got to get on. 
4425,"CARSTAIRS: Goodbye, Doctor. "
4426,"ZOE: Oh, Doctor, wait! Goodbye! "
4427,"JAMIE: Bye, Lieutenant. "
4428,CARSTAIRS: Bye. 
4429,"(The Doctor, Zoe and Jamie rush away, and Carstairs waves then"
4430,vanishes.) 
4431,"JAMIE: Hey, he's "
4432,DOCTOR: Come on! 
4433,(The strange sound is here too. Their movements get slower and slower
4434,as they run towards the Tardis.) 
4435,DOCTOR: Come on! 
4436,ZOE: What is it? 
4437,DOCTOR: Time Lords! Try harder! We must get away! 
4438,(They are on hands and knees by the time they get to the Tardis.) 
4439,DOCTOR: We must get away! 
4440,(The Doctor just manages to put the key in the lock.)
4441,
4442,Episode Ten
4443,
4444, [Outside the Tardis]
4445,
4446," ZOE: What's happening, Doctor? I can hardly move. "
4447,DOCTOR: It's a force field. Concentrate. We may be able to break
4448,through it. Help me with the key. Concentrate! 
4449,(Jamie holds the Doctor's arm up to turn the key and open the Tardis
4450,door.)
4451,
4452, [Tardis]
4453,
4454, (They crawl inside.) 
4455,"ZOE: It's in here, too. "
4456,"JAMIE: Will we get away all right, Doctor? "
4457,(The Doctor reaches the door controls.) 
4458,"DOCTOR: Yes, I hope so, Jamie. If I can boost the power enough, the"
4459,Tardis may be able to break through the force field. 
4460,(The Tardis dematerialises and they can move at normal speed again.) 
4461,"JAMIE: Well, what was happening? Why was it so difficult to move? "
4462,DOCTOR: It was the Time Lords. 
4463,"ZOE: But they're your own people, aren't they, Doctor? "
4464,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. "
4465,JAMIE: Why did you run away from them in the first place? 
4466,"DOCTOR: What? Well, I was bored. "
4467,"ZOE: What do you mean, you were bored? "
4468,"DOCTOR: Well, the Time Lords are an immensely civilised race. We can"
4469,"control our own environment, we can live forever, barring accidents,"
4470,and we have the secret of space time travel. 
4471,JAMIE: Well what's so wrong in all that? 
4472,DOCTOR: Well we hardly ever use our great powers. We consent simply to
4473,observe and to gather knowledge. 
4474,ZOE: And that wasn't enough for you? 
4475,"DOCTOR: No, of course not. With a whole galaxy to explore? Millions of"
4476,"planets, eons of time, countless civilisations to meet? "
4477,"JAMIE: Well, why do they object to you doing all that? "
4478,"DOCTOR: Well, It is a fact, Jamie, that I do tend to get involved with"
4479,things. 
4480,"JAMIE: Aye, you can say that again. Whenever there's any trouble, he's"
4481,in it right up to his neck. 
4482,"ZOE: But you've helped people, Doctor. "
4483,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, but that's no excuse in their eyes. "
4484,"JAMIE: Well, then what are you going to do?Â "
4485,DOCTOR: We're going to run away. I've set the controls to take us to a
4486,planet on the outermost fringes of the galaxy. 
4487,"JAMIE: Oh, in that case, we'll probably land up right in their laps. "
4488,(The Tardis dematerialises.) 
4489,ZOE: We can't be landing already. 
4490,"DOCTOR: Well, that is impossible! "
4491,"(The TARDIS is dropping through the air to a sea, where it lands with a"
4492,gentle plop.) 
4493,"JAMIE: Oh, it's the sea. "
4494,"ZOE: Well, don't worry, Jamie. We know the Tardis can't sink. "
4495,"JAMIE: Oh, can't it? Look! "
4496,(The scanner is looking straight at a coral reef.) 
4497,"ZOE: Oh, now what can we do? "
4498,(A shark swims by.) 
4499,JAMIE: Look out! 
4500,DOCTOR: It's all right. It can't possibly harm us. 
4501,(A type of materialisation noise sounds and the Tardis shakes.) 
4502,JAMIE: I'm not so sure! 
4503,DOCTOR: We're perfectly safe in the Tardis. 
4504,ZOE: Doctor! 
4505,(Water is dripping onto the console.) 
4506,DOCTOR: Oh my word! It's the Time Lords. They're breaking down the
4507,defensive mechanism. We've got to get out of here. 
4508,ZOE: Where can we go? 
4509,"DOCTOR: Well, I know one place where we'll be safe, if I can get us"
4510,there. 
4511,(The Doctor relocates the Tardis.) 
4512,JAMIE: Where are we? 
4513,DOCTOR: We're in outer space. We'll just stop here for a while. There's
4514,a chance we may have given them the slip. 
4515,"(A gentle, reasonable voice fills the Tardis.) "
4516,"TIME LORD : There is no escape, Doctor. Return the Tardis"
4517,immediately to our home planet. 
4518,DOCTOR: Why can't you leave me alone? I haven't done any harm. 
4519,TIME LORD : You have broken our laws. You must face your trial. 
4520,JAMIE: Trial? 
4521,TIME LORD : You will do better to return of your own accord. 
4522,"DOCTOR: Oh, oh, oh, very well, if I must. "
4523,"ZOE: Doctor, what on Earth are you doing? "
4524,DOCTOR: I'm trying to make a quick transference jump. We've got to get
4525,"away from here to somewhere safe. Ah, we're landing. "
4526,(The scanner shows alligators.) 
4527,"DOCTOR: Oh, no! "
4528,JAMIE: Is that what you call somewhere safe? 
4529,(The trio are thrown to the floor.) 
4530,ZOE: Oh! It's shaking itself to pieces! 
4531,"JAMIE: Yeah, we could all be killed! "
4532,"ZOE: Doctor, can't you induce a power drive? "
4533,"DOCTOR: I'll try. Oh, the controls. They're moving by themselves. "
4534,(Everything settles down again.) 
4535,JAMIE: Now where are we? 
4536,"ZOE: Oh, let's see on the scanner. "
4537,"JAMIE: Oh, it's broken. "
4538,"ZOE: No, I don't think so. "
4539,(Suddenly the picture resolves itself into a long chamber filled with
4540,SIDRATS along one wall.) 
4541,"TIME LORD : You have returned to us, Doctor. Your travels are over."
4542,
4543,DOCTOR: It's my own planet. They have brought us here. 
4544,JAMIE: Can't we get away again? 
4545,"DOCTOR: No, not this time. Come along."
4546,
4547, [SIDRAT bay]
4548,
4549,(A man in a long robe is waiting for them.) 
4550,TIME LORD 2: Come with me. 
4551,"JAMIE: Now, just a moment. What's going on around here? "
4552,"DOCTOR: Jamie, do as he says."
4553,
4554, [Trial chamber]
4555,
4556,(They are led in. The War Lord is already there.
4557,The Time Lord joins two others.) 
4558,TIME LORD 2: The witnesses have arrived. 
4559,TIME LORD: Let them stand aside until they are needed. Continue with
4560,the trial. 
4561,"(Yes, that mellifluous voice is  Bernard Horsfall"
4562,again.) 
4563,"TIME LORD 3: In every one of these time zones, thousands of human"
4564,beings fought and died in the belief that they were on their own
4565,planet. The survivors have now all been returned to their own times on
4566,"the planet Earth, but the death roll is beyond counting. These lives"
4567,were squandered in the course of a vicious and diabolical scheme to
4568,gain control of the entire galaxy. A scheme originated and devised by a
4569,race of which the accused is the leader. It was a was a highly
4570,organised scheme with an utterly callous disregard for the lives of the
4571,humans involved and for the liberties of all the other species in the
4572,galaxy which the accused would have dominated with his tyranny. In the
4573,"pursuit of this scheme, brutal methods of mental processing were used"
4574,which entirely contravened all the galactic laws. I will now call upon
4575,a member of our own race to sort this evil matter out. There will
4576,commence a reading of the witness' report. The witness is called. Will
4577,"you step forward, please? "
4578,"(Over the above statement, the Doctor is explaining.) "
4579,DOCTOR: The Time Lords holding a trial is a very rare event. 
4580,ZOE: Why? 
4581,"DOCTOR: Well, normally they don't interfere with the affairs of other"
4582,"planets, but they had to when I called for help. "
4583,"JAMIE: Well, look, can't we get away? "
4584,"DOCTOR: Well, you and Zoe may, but I don't think I will. "
4585,"TIME LORD 3: Will you step forward, please? "
4586,"DOCTOR: Oh, oh, I beg your pardon. "
4587,TIME LORD 3: We have received your statement. Do you swear to the truth
4588,of your report? 
4589,DOCTOR: Everything in that report is the result of my direct personal
4590,observation. 
4591,TIME LORD 3: Who is that person? 
4592,DOCTOR: That is the War Lord. 
4593,TIME LORD 3: Does the accused have anything to say? 
4594,TIME LORD: You must speak in your defence. 
4595,TIME LORD 2: The trial cannot proceed unless you do. 
4596,TIME LORD 3: You must speak. 
4597,DOCTOR: Can't you see he's just playing for time? 
4598,TIME LORD 3: Do not make us force you to speak. We would not cause you
4599,unnecessary pain. Very well. 
4600,(The Time Lord widens his eyes and suddenly the War Lord falls to his
4601,knees screaming and clutching his head.) 
4602,WAR LORD: Stop it! Stop the light! 
4603,TIME LORD 3: You must speak. 
4604,WAR LORD: Yes. 
4605,TIME LORD 3: Do you admit the charges with which you have been accused?
4606,
4607,WAR LORD: I do not even admit the authority of this court. 
4608,TIME LORD: Have you anything to say in your defence? 
4609,WAR LORD: The humans who died in our war games would have killed each
4610,other anyway. 
4611,TIME LORD 2: Is your plea that that ends justifies the means? 
4612,"WAR LORD: Yes, it is. And members of your own race agreed with me. My"
4613,"War Chief was himself was a Time Lord, and the knowledge he brought me"
4614,made the whole scheme possible. And another of your Time Lords gave me
4615,his support! 
4616,DOCTOR: I never supported your scheme for one moment. 
4617,"WAR LORD: You collaborated with my War Chief. If I am guilty, then you"
4618,are guilty too! 
4619,"(Meanwhile, two men are inside the Tardis, working on the console. One"
4620,goes out to investigate the sound of materialisation and is gunned down
4621,by two of the War Lord's guards. The second then comes out and is also
4622,killed. Then a total of six guards move off.) 
4623,TIME LORD: We find you guilty of all charges against you. Your attempt
4624,to incriminate others is an obvious fraud. 
4625,"DOCTOR: Oh, good. I'm glad to see your sense of justice still prevails."
4626,(sotto) Even though they've lost their sense of humour. 
4627,WAR LORD: You have no authority over me. 
4628,(The guards enter.) 
4629,WAR LORD: And no power any longer to pass any sentence. Take these
4630,people. 
4631,"DOCTOR: Oh, no! "
4632,JAMIE: Not again. 
4633,"(The Doctor, Zoe and Jamie are hustled out.) "
4634,"WAR LORD: And if any attempt is made to stop us, then I shall kill them"
4635,instantly. 
4636,TIME LORD: Let them go. We shall not endanger innocent lives.
4637,
4638, [SIDRAT bay]
4639,
4640, DOCTOR: You'll never get away. The Time Lords are
4641,too strong for you. You needn't think I'm going to help you. 
4642,"WAR LORD: Oh yes, you will help us, Doctor, if you want to save the"
4643,"lives of your two friends. Now, into the machine. "
4644,"JAMIE: Look, the Tardis is no good to you. He can't even steer it"
4645,properly. 
4646,"WAR LORD: Don't talk rubbish. Of course he can steer it. Now, into the"
4647,machine!
4648,
4649, [Tardis]
4650,
4651," WAR LORD: Yes, you shall make us many of these"
4652,"machines. Now, get to the control panel and take us back to the home"
4653,planet. 
4654,"DOCTOR: I can't, I tell you. The directional mechanism is faulty. "
4655,WAR LORD: You will do as I say or we shall kill the girl. 
4656,DOCTOR: But I don't even know where your home planet is. 
4657,"WAR LORD: Galactic sector nine seven three, then we will get the homing"
4658,signal. Now operate the machine! 
4659,"DOCTOR: I'll do my best, but I can't promise anything. Jamie, Zoe, hide"
4660,your eyes. Run! 
4661,(The Tardis lights are blinding.) 
4662,WAR LORD: Get after them! Kill them! Quickly!
4663,
4664, [SIDRAT bay]
4665,
4666,"(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe run over to the Time"
4667,Lords.) 
4668,WAR LORD: Kill them! 
4669,(But a forcefield stops the guards.) 
4670,"TIME LORD 3: A force field has been placed around you, and around your"
4671,"planet, so that your warlike people will remain prisoners forever. You"
4672,"have been found guilty of all charges, and you and your murderous"
4673,associates will be dematerialised. It will be as though you had never
4674,existed. 
4675,"WAR LORD: No, no, no, no! "
4676,(The War Lord and the guards vanish.) 
4677,"JAMIE: Ah, well, that's put an end to them. Well, we'll be on our way."
4678,"Come on, Doctor. Cheerio. "
4679,(Jamie strolls over to the Tardis and straight into the forcefield
4680,which then envelopes him and Zoe.) 
4681,"JAMIE: Oh, switch this thing off. "
4682,"DOCTOR: Jamie, they are not going to let us go. "
4683,JAMIE: What? After all you've done for them? 
4684,(The Doctor and two Time Lords leave.) 
4685,ZOE: What are you going to do to him? 
4686,TIME LORD 3: He must stand his trial. You will wait here. 
4687,"ZOE: Well, we want to go with the Doctor! Oh, let us out! "
4688,"JAMIE: Come on, let us out of this thing!"
4689,
4690, [Trial chamber]
4691,
4692," TIME LORD: You have heard the charge against you,"
4693,that you have repeatedly broken our most important law of
4694,non-interference in the affairs of other planets. What have you to say?
4695,Do you admit these actions? 
4696,"DOCTOR: I not only admit them, I am proud of them. While you have been"
4697,"content merely to observe the evil in the galaxy, I have been fighting"
4698,against it. 
4699,"TIME LORD 3: It is not we who are on trial here, Doctor, it is you. "
4700,"DOCTOR: No, no, of course, you're above criticism, aren't you. "
4701,TIME LORD: Do you admit that these actions were justified? 
4702,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course, I do. Give me a thought channel and I'll show"
4703,you some of the evils I've been fighting against. 
4704,(The Time Lords nod to each other.) 
4705,"DOCTOR: The Quarks, deadly robot servants of the cruel Dominators, they"
4706,"tried to enslave a peace loving race. Then there were the Yeti, more"
4707,"robot killers, instruments of an alien intelligence trying to take over"
4708,the planet Earth. 
4709,TIME LORD 3: All this is entirely irrelevant. 
4710,"DOCTOR: You asked me to justify my actions, I am doing so. Let me show"
4711,"you the Ice Warriors, cruel Martian invaders, they tried to conquer the"
4712,"Earth too. So did the Cybermen, half creature, half machine. But worst"
4713,"of all were the Daleks, a pitiless race of conquerors exterminating all"
4714,who came up against them. All these evils I have fought while you have
4715,"done nothing but observe. True, I am guilty of interference, just as"
4716,you are guilty of failing to use your great powers to help those in
4717,need! 
4718,TIME LORD: Is that all you have to say? 
4719,"DOCTOR: Well, isn't it enough? "
4720,TIME LORD: Your defence has been heard and will be carefully
4721,"considered, but you have raised difficult issues. We require time to"
4722,think about them. You will be recalled when we have made our decision.
4723,
4724, [SIDRAT bay]
4725,
4726, JAMIE: Let us out! 
4727,ZOE: We want to see the Doctor. Let us out of here! 
4728,(The force field is turned off.) 
4729,TIME LORD 2: Follow me. 
4730,ZOE: Where are we going? 
4731,TIME LORD 2: We're going to send you home. Back you your own world and
4732,your own time. 
4733,"JAMIE: Oh no, not without the Doctor. "
4734,TIME LORD 2: This is his world. He must stay here. 
4735,"ZOE: Well, what's going to happen to him? "
4736,TIME LORD 2: He is awaiting the result of his trial. 
4737,"JAMIE: Aye, well, I'm not going till I see him. "
4738,"ZOE: Oh, please, can't we see the Doctor? "
4739,TIME LORD 2: You have become attached to him? 
4740,"JAMIE: Aye, we've been through a lot, you know. "
4741,ZOE: Please let us see him.

4752,TIME LORD 2: I've brought your friends to say goodbye. 
4753,"JAMIE: Oh, switch this thing off. "
4754,ZOE: We can't say goodbye through a forcefield. 
4755,TIME LORD 2: Very well. I shall leave you together. for a little while.
4756,
4757,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. "
4758,(The forcefield disappears and the Time Lord leaves.) 
4759,DOCTOR: Jamie! Zoe! 
4760,ZOE: Doctor! 
4761,JAMIE: What are they going to do to you? 
4762,"DOCTOR: Oh, nothing much. I expect they'll to make me listen to a long"
4763,boring speech about being a good boy. They like making speeches. 
4764,"ZOE: Well, I think it's time you left them again. "
4765,"DOCTOR: Well, that's easier said than done. "
4766,"JAMIE: Oh come on, we've been in tighter situations than this. "
4767,"DOCTOR: Well, you don't know the Time Lords, Jamie. I do. "
4768,"ZOE: Oh, you're not just going to give up, are you, Doctor? "
4769,"JAMIE: Of course he's not. Are you, Doctor, eh? "
4770,"DOCTOR: Well. Oh, all right, but we may find it a bit difficult getting"
4771,out of here. 
4772,"JAMIE: Hey, they've forgotten to switch that thing back on again. "
4773,DOCTOR: Forgotten? 
4774,"ZOE: Well, that's all we need, isn't it? Now we can get away. "
4775,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, of course. "

4786,"DOCTOR: No Zoe, not this time. Well, goodbye, Jamie. "
4787,JAMIE: But Doctor surely we could 
4788,"DOCTOR: Goodbye, Jamie. "
4789,"JAMIE: I won't forget you, you know.Â "
4790,"DOCTOR: I won't forget you. Don't go blundering into too much trouble,"
4791,will you? 
4792,"JAMIE: Oh, you're a fine one to talk. "
4793,"DOCTOR: Goodbye, Zoe. "
4794,"ZOE: Goodbye, Doctor. Will we ever meet again? "
4795,"DOCTOR: Again? Now, Zoe, you and I know, time is relative, isn't it? "
4796,(Jamie and Zoe are led to a SIDRAT. They wave and go inside. It
4797,dematerialises.) 
4798,"DOCTOR: They'll forget me, won't they? "
4799,TIME LORD 2: Not entirely. They will be returned to a time just before
4800,they went away with you. They will remember their first adventure with

4812,be done if we're going to get the Wheel back to normal. Are you sure
4813,you're all right? 
4814,"ZOE: Oh, yes. I thought I'd forgotten something important, but it's"
4815,nothing. 
4816,"TANYA: Right, come along then. "
4817,"ZOE: All right, I'm coming. "
4818, [Trial chamber]
4819,
4820,"(On the screen, Zoe looks back then the image"
4821,fades.) 
4822,"DOCTOR: She'll be all right, won't she? "
4823,TIME LORD: Of course. 
4824,DOCTOR: What about Jamie? 
4825,TIME LORD 3: Look.

4827, [Culloden Moor]
4828,
4829, (Pipes are skirling as a Redcoat aims his musket
4830,at Jamie's back. He turns and drops just as the soldier fires.) 
4831,"JAMIE: Try to murder a McCrimmon, would you? Well, I'll show you! Creag"
4832,an Tuire! 
4833,"(Jamie charges the Redcoat, swinging his sword while the man tries to"
4834,reload. The soldier wisely gives up and flees.)
4835,
4836, [Trial chamber]
4837,
4838, TIME LORD: They will both continue their lives as
4839,if nothing had happened. 
4840,"DOCTOR: Yes, very efficient. Now then, what about me? "
4841,TIME LORD: We have accepted your plea that there is evil in the
4842,"universe that must be fought, and that you still have a part to play in"
4843,that battle. 
4844,DOCTOR: What? You mean that you're going to let me go free? 
4845,TIME LORD: Not entirely. We have noted your particular interest in the
4846,planet Earth. The frequency of your visits must have given you special
4847,knowledge of that world and it's problems. 
4848,"DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose that's true. Earth seems more vulnerable than"
4849,"others, yes. "
4850,TIME LORD: For that reason you will be sent back to that planet. 
4851,"DOCTOR: Oh, good. "
4852,TIME LORD: In exile. 
4853,DOCTOR: In exile? 
4854,"TIME LORD: You will be sent to Earth in the twentieth century, and will"
4855,"remain there for as long as we deem proper, and for that period the"
4856,secret of the Tardis will be taken from you. 
4857,"DOCTOR: But you, you can't condemn me to exile on one primitive planet"
4858,"in one century in time! Besides, I'm known on the Earth. It might be"
4859,very awkward for me. 
4860,"TIME LORD: Your appearance has changed before, it will change again."
4861,That is part of the sentence. 
4862,DOCTOR: You can't just change what I look like without consulting me! 
4863,TIME LORD: You will have an opportunity to choose your appearance. 
4864,"DOCTOR: Oh, well, that's not so bad. But I warn you, I'm very"
4865,particular. 
4866,TIME LORD: Here is your first choice. 
4867,"(A man with a big bushy beard, followed by other sketches.) "
4868,"DOCTOR: Oh he's too old! Well he's too fat, isn't he. No, he's too"
4869,"thin. That one's too young. Oh now, that won't do at all. It's"
4870,ridiculous. 
4871,"TIME LORD: You're wasting time, Doctor. "
4872,"DOCTOR: It's not my fault, is it? Is this the best you can do? I've"
4873,never seen such an incredible bunch. 
4874,"TIME LORD: Since you refuse to take the decision, the decision will be"
4875,taken for you. 
4876,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, I never said that. But I maintain I have the right"
4877,to decide what I look like! It could be very important on the Earth.
4878,People on Earth attach a very great deal of importance 
4879,(The Doctor's face is beginning to twist and change.) 
4880,"DOCTOR: Ah, what's happening? "
4881,(We are treated to multiple images of Patrick gurning as they circle
4882,around.) 
4883,"DOCTOR: What's hap, what's happened? "
4884,"TIME LORD: The time has come for you to change your appearance, Doctor,"
4885,and begin your exile. 
4886,"DOCTOR: Is this some sort of joke? No, I refuse to be treated in. What"
4887,are you doing? 
4888,(The Doctor's face disappears.) 
4889,"DOCTOR: No! Stop, you're making me giddy! No, you can't do this to me!"
4890,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!  "
