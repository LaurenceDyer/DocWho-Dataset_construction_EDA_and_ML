20,One 
21, [Inflatable boat] 
22, (A pair of inflatables are being paddled by
23,soldiers. They pass over the remarkably well preserved prow of a sunken
24,"wooden vessel, which has the head of a dragon. A mist swirls in.) "
25,"PROZOROV: (in Russian) Captain, we've lost the others. "
26,SORIN: Don't worry. Keep rowing. 
27,(They head underneath a rock arch towards a rocky shore. Welcome to
28,"Lulworth Cove, Dorset, a long way from the purported location.) "
29, [Navy base] 
30," (Played by Crowborough Training Camp, Cranbrook,"
31,Sussex. 
32,The Tardis materialises by a large red brick structure. The Doctor and
33,Ace come out. She is wearing a 1940's outfit with a red snood holding
34,"her hair back, while he has a duffel coat on.) "
35,"DOCTOR: Ah, this looks about right. World War Two uniforms. No need to"
36,worry about looking silly. 
37,"ACE: If this is a top secret naval camp, then I'm Lord Nelson. "
38,"DOCTOR: Oh, whine, whine, whine, whine. "
39,"ACE: Professor, top secret naval camps usually have men with guns all"
40,over the place. You don't just stroll in. 
41,(The Doctor stops while Ace walks on.) 
42, [Lookout post]
43,
44, (Sergeant Leigh observes the newcomers
45,from behind a pile of sandbags covered with camouflage netting. He
46,radios his report.) 
47,"LEIGH: House guests leaving the conservatory, entering the library."
48,
49, [Command room]
50,
51, (Captain Bates receives the report.) 
52,LEIGH : They'll reach the drawing room in about sixty seconds. 
53,
54, [Maidens Point] 
55," (Meanwhile, the Russians pull their inflatable up"
56,onto what passes for a beach in these parts.) 
57,SORIN: (in Russian) Set up camp over there. Move it. Take the boat up. 
58,(Sorin taps a nervous young soldier on the shoulder.) 
59,PETROSSIAN: What's happened to our comrades? 
60,"SORIN: Nothing, nothing. Go on, move on."
61,
62, [Navy camp]
63,
64, ACE: I've had more trouble getting into Greenford
65,disco without a ticket. 
66,DOCTOR: You can always go back. 
67,ACE: I'd rather go rock climbing. 
68,DOCTOR: Not in those clothes.
69,
70, [Lookout post]
71,
72, LEIGH: House guests leaving the nursery.
73,Wait! Something's wrong. One of them's a girl.
74,
75, [Command post]
76,
77," BATES: Say again, lookout? "
78,LEIGH : One of them's a girl. They're the wrong ones! 
79,(Bates turns to another transmitter.) 
80,BATES: Rat trap! Rat trap now! 
81, [Naval camp]
82,
83," (The guard are mobilised, and the Doctor and Ace"
84,find themselves surrounded by rifles.) 
85,LEIGH: Don't move! Hand's up! 
86,DOCTOR: About time too! Call yourselves Royal Marines? You're a
87,disgrace. Those boots are filthy. What would happen if the Germans
88,attacked now? 
89,"PERKINS: Sorry, sir. "
90,"ACE: In fact, how do you know we aren't Germans? Well, answer me. "
91,"PERKINS: You don't look like Germans, ma'am. "
92,DOCTOR: I don't suppose you know where Doctor Judson's office is? Never
93,mind. This way. 
94,"ACE: Yes, sir. "
95,(The Doctor and Ace stride away through the troop of marines towards a
96,single story building.)
97,
98, [Maidens Point] 
99, (Prozorov speaks to Sorin in Russian.) 
100,"SORIN: Prozorov, everything in English. From now on, everything in"
101,English. 
102,"PROZOROV: Quick, down on the beach. "
103,SORIN: Come on! 
104,PETROSSIAN: How long till nightfall? 
105,SORIN: Long enough. Come on! 
106,"(A Russian soldier is pulled from the water, looking unnaturally white."
107,His eyes are staring and there are scratches on his neck.) 
108,"SORIN: Gayev, listen to me. Where are the sealed orders? You had them."
109,"Gayev, what's happened to them? Gayev! Let's take him to the"
110,"camp. Move out! Move, move, move!"
111,
112, [Judson's office]
113,
114, (Doctor Judson is sitting in a wheelchair and
115,working at a logic problem on a blackboard when there is a knock on the
116,door. The Doctor and Ace enter.) 
117,JUDSON: What in heaven's name! 
118,(Everyone say Hi! to 
119,Dinsdale Landen.) 
120,DOCTOR: You must be Doctor Judson. Excuse the interruption. I've travelled
121,a long way to meet you. 
122,JUDSON: This is intolerable! 
123,(Judson's nurse intervenes.) 
124,"CRANE: A little less excitement please, Doctor Judson. Remember your"
125,blood pressure. 
126,(Everyone say Hi! to the splendid northern lady Anne Reid.) 
127,DOCTOR: The Prisoner's Dilemma. 
128,CRANE: You can't just stroll in 
129,"JUDSON: Oh, shut up, Crane. You're familiar with the Prisoner's"
130,"Dilemma, then? "
131,"DOCTOR: Based on a false premise, don't you think, like all"
132,"zero sum games, but a neat algorithm nevertheless, Doctor"
133,"Judson. Excuse me, do you have any official stationery and a typewriter"
134,I could use? 
135,JUDSON: On the desk. 
136,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
137,"JUDSON: You're obviously also an expert in this field, but I'm afraid I"
138,don't recognise 
139,DOCTOR: Ace. 
140,"ACE: Hi, I'm Ace and this is the Professor. "
141,DOCTOR: Doctor. 
142,"ACE: Sorry, Doctor. Oh, wow! Have you seen this, Professor? "
143,(The Doctor starts typing as Ace takes the puzzle from the top of a
144,filing cabinet.) 
145,"JUDSON: Put it down, child. It's not a toy. "
146,ACE: I know it's not. It's a flip-flop thingy. We used them at school. 
147,JUDSON: You understand it? 
148,"ACE: Yeah, it's a logic game, isn't it? You drop marbles in the top,"
149,"and depending on what colour each window is, the marble follows a"
150,different path. You've got a logic diagram for it on the blackboard. 
151,JUDSON: This is extraordinary! And you learnt about logic at school? 
152,"ACE: Mmm, Miss Birkett taught us in computer studies. She was well"
153,good. Can I borrow this? 
154,"DOCTOR: Two pens, please. "
155,JUDSON: Crane! 
156,(Nurse Crane hands the Doctor two pens.) 
157,"DOCTOR: Ah, thank you. "
158,(The Doctor crosses his arms and signs two names at the bottom of his
159,"fresh War Office headed paper, which says Sir, this is to authorise the"
160,entry of the Doctor and his assistant Ace into the naval camp. The
161,signatures are those of Winston Churchill PM and somebody Menzies.) 
162,DOCTOR: There we are. Come in. 
163,(There is a knock at the door. Bates enters.) 
164,"BATES: I'm sorry to disturb you sir, but these two are unauthorised"
165,personnel. 
166,DOCTOR: Unauthorised? We are here by urgent request of the War Office.
167,I think you'll find this is signed by the Prime Minister and the head
168,of the Secret Service. 
169,(The Doctor hands Captain Bates his fresh forgery.) 
170,"BATES: I must apologise, sir. We weren't informed of your arrival. "
171,"DOCTOR: Need to know, Captain, need to know. Doctor Judson's work at"
172,trying to break the German codes is very important to the war effort. 
173,BATES: (to Ace) We thought you were something to do with those East End
174,kids. Evacuees. 
175,"ACE: I'm not from the East End, I'm from "
176,JUDSON: Perhaps you'd like to see the Ultima machine? 
177,DOCTOR: The Ultima machine? Yes. 
178,"JUDSON: Ah, Bates, go and fetch Commander Millington, will you? "
179,BATES: Sir. 
180,"DOCTOR: Commander? Well, on second thoughts, it's been a tiring day."
181,"Perhaps tomorrow, Doctor Judson. If you'll just show us to our"
182,"quarters, we'd be grateful. Thank you."
183,
184, [Maidens Point]
185,
186," SORIN: Now, as soon as it's dark, we check the"
187,"base. Petrossian, you check the shoreline in case anything gets washed"
188,up. 
189,PETROSSIAN: Alone? 
190,SORIN: It only needs one. 
191,PETROSSIAN: Will you listen to me? There's evil here. Can't you feel it
192,cold against your skin. 
193,SORIN: Stop it! More stupid Armenian superstitions. You're supposed to
194,be a soldier. 
195,PETROSSIAN: So was he. 
196,SORIN: You follow orders. 
197,"(Gayev is still alive, but shaking. Down on the shoreline, in the"
198,"gloom, Petrossian finds the oilskin pouch and slits it open with his"
199,knife. Inside is a photograph of Doctor Judson and a map.)
200,
201,[Bunk room]
202,
203, ACE: Ace! Bunk beds! Bags I go on top. 
204,"DOCTOR: Quiet, Ace. People are trying to sleep. "
205,ACE: Sorry. 
206,(Ace climbs onto a creaky bunk.) 
207,ACE: Is it all right if I go down to the cliffs tomorrow and do some
208,rock climbing? 
209,DOCTOR: Go to sleep. 
210,ACE: Sorry. 
211, (The Doctor goes to the door.) 
212,ACE: Night. Where are you off to? 
213,DOCTOR: Night air. Go to sleep. 
214,(The Doctor leaves. Ace starts playing the logic game instead.
215,Somewhere a baby cries. 
216," Down on the beach, Petrossian sees something"
217,approaching him. He drops his rifle and runs.)
218,
219, [Perimeter fence]
220,
221, (Young Perkins jumps when the Doctor comes up
222,behind him.) 
223,"PERKINS: Oh, it's you, sir. Thank goodness. I thought "
224,DOCTOR: Eyes. Eyes watching. 
225,"(Sorin makes his way along the outside of the fence, noting the"
226,patrols. 
227,"Down by the water, Petrossian gets trapped against the cliff by his"
228,pursuer. He screams.)
229,
230,[Outside St Jude's Church]
231,
232,"(Played by the lovely St Lawrence church,"
233,"Hawkhurst, Kent. "
234,"It is after morning service, and the vicar of the parish is speaking to"
235,his parishioners
236,"as they leave the church. Everyone say Hi! to Nicholas Parsons, but"
237,"preferably without repetition, hesitation or deviation.) "
238,WAINWRIGHT: Thank you so much. What a lovely day. Miss Hardaker. 
239,"(The perennial hard-nosed spinster, who could easily play the Wicked"
240,Witch of the West without makeup.) 
241,"HARDAKER: Your sermon, Mister Wainwright. "
242,WAINWRIGHT: Yes? 
243,"HARDAKER: There's no doubt about it, Mister Wainwright, of course we'll"
244,win the war. Right is on our side. 
245,"WAINWRIGHT: I don't think that right is on anyone's side in war, Miss"
246,Hardaker. 
247,HARDAKER: Your father would turn in his grave to hear such words. When
248,"he was vicar of this parish, there was respect for the Good Book. "
249,WAINWRIGHT: I think that faith is more than just words. 
250,"HARDAKER: In plain language, doubt and indecision. "
251,WAINWRIGHT: Miss Hardaker 
252,(The Doctor and Ace rescue him.) 
253,DOCTOR: Pardon me. I wonder if you could help me. I'm looking for
254,Doctor Judson. 
255,"WAINWRIGHT: Oh, I think you'll find him still working in the crypt. If"
256,"you'd like to follow me. Er, good day, Miss Hardaker. This way. "
257,(The Doctor and Reverend Wainwright to into the church. Ace speaks to a
258,couple of young women.) 
259,ACE: Who's the old gargoyle? Friend of yours? 
260,JEAN: She's the old bag we've been billeted with. 
261,ACE: Come again? 
262,JEAN: We've been evacuated. 
263,PHYLLIS: We're from London. 
264,"ACE: Oh, so am I. "
265,"HARDAKER : Come along, girls. Time we were moving. "
266,"ACE: Okay, see you later. "
267,PHYLLIS: Where? 
268,ACE: What about over there? 
269,(Ace spots a sign post saying a distance of two miles to -) 
270,"PHYLLIS: Maidens Point. Oh, well, that rules me and Jean out"
271,for a start. See you. 
272,"ACE: See you, girls. Bye.  "
273, [Millington's office] 
274, (Commander Millington peruses a document whilst
275,surrounded by Third Reich insignia and even a portrait of Hitler over
276,the fireplace.) 
277, (Bates enters and realises he is interrupting.) 
278,"BATES: I'm sorry, sir. "
279,(Bates leaves.) (Millington's concentration is broken. He
280,gets up and goes to a chess board on a round table. The pieces are
281,stylised Viking warriors like the Lewis chess set.)
282,
283, [Saint Jude's church]
284,
285, WAINWRIGHT: I can't see why he spends so
286,much time studying old carvings. I keep telling him he's wasting his
287,time. 
288,DOCTOR: Answering questions is never a waste of time. 
289,WAINWRIGHT: Surely that depends on the answers. When I was studying at
290,Saint Andrew's 
291,(Ace joins them.) 
292,DOCTOR: Nietzsche says 
293,"ACE: We're not going to be long, are we, Professor? Only I've arranged"
294,to meet Phyllis and Jean later. 
295,WAINWRIGHT: If you'll just follow me. 
296,DOCTOR: I was having a good conversation. 
297, [Church vestry] 
298, (Ace follows the Doctor and Reverend Wainwright in
299,"from the body of the church, and spots the church's treasures.) "
300,"ACE: Hey, Vicar. "
301,WAINWRIGHT: Yes? 
302,ACE: You shouldn't leave all this silverware lying around. You're wide
303,open. 
304,(She picks up a tall candlestick.) 
305,WAINWRIGHT: They're suspicious people in these parts. Too afraid of the
306,old Viking curse to break in here. 
307,ACE: Curse? 
308,WAINWRIGHT: This church is built on old Viking graves. They say evil
309,was once buried here.
310,
311, [Crypt] 
312," (Petrossian's body lies on the rocks, pale and"
313,with slashes on his neck. 
314,"Meanwhile, below the main body of the church, Doctor Judson is making"
315,notes of some runes carved into the crypt wall. Nurse Crane holds a
316,lantern for him.) 
317,"WAINWRIGHT: Here we are, Doctor. This is the crypt. "
318,"JUDSON: Ah, Doctor. What do you make of these, then, hmm? "
319,"DOCTOR: Fascinating. Ace, look at this. "
320,ACE: They look like Viking carvings. 
321,"DOCTOR: Viking rune stones. Ninth century, yes? "
322,"JUDSON: Ah, you evidently know more than I do. "
323,"DOCTOR: Well, it's the alphabet. The later Vikings used a sixteen"
324,character alphabet. 
325,JUDSON: Don't tell me. The Ultima machine can break the most
326,sophisticated Nazi ciphers. Some ninth century scribbling shouldn't be
327,much of a problem. 
328,ACE: Professor? 
329,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
330,ACE: What's that noise? 
331,DOCTOR: What noise? 
332,ACE: Like a machine. 
333,"DOCTOR: Organ bellows. Come on, let's leave Doctor Judson to his"
334,puzzles. 
335,"ACE: Yeah, okay."
336,
337, [Outside Saint Jude's church]
338,
339," ACE: Yeah, it was definitely some kind of"
340,"machinery, Professor. Only don't bother listening to me, 'cause I'm"
341,only a mere mortal. 
342,"(The Doctor points at a large, tilted gravestone with dates from 1809"
343,to 1898.) 
344,DOCTOR: Look. 
345,"ACE: Yeah, graves. "
346,"DOCTOR: No, at the ground. "
347,ACE: There's a slight dip in it. 
348,DOCTOR: Subsidence. And since the grave was dug. 
349,ACE: How do you know that? 
350,"DOCTOR: Well, either that, or they'd been at the communion wine when"
351,they'd put up the headstone. Joseph Sundvik. He must be one of the
352,descendants of the original Viking settlers. 
353,"ACE: Look at the last one. She only lived thirteen days, poor little"
354,thing. (Mary Ellen Millington) You don't suppose it was that Viking
355,"curse, do you? "
356,DOCTOR: Where did you say you were meeting your two friends? 
357,ACE: Somewhere called Maidens Point. 
358,DOCTOR: I think I'll go with you.
359,
360, [Miss Hardaker's cottage] 
361, HARDAKER: Maidens Point! Did you say Maidens
362,Point? 
363,PHYLLIS: I only want to go for a walk. Maybe have a swim. 
364,HARDAKER: I know what girls who go to Maidens Point have in mind. You
365,"will never go near the place, neither of you. "
366,JEAN: All right. Keep your hair on. 
367,HARDAKER: You impudent child. Do you know why it's called Maidens
368,"Point? Because when you stand on those cliffs, you can hear the"
369,terrible lost cries of girls who went to that place with evil in their
370,"hearts. Girls who are damned forever. Yes, you mark my words."
371,There's evil at Maidens Point.
372,
373, [Maidens Point]
374,
375,(The Doctor and Ace stand on the top of the cliff.)
376,
377,"ACE: I like watching the sea. It makes me feel so small. Oh, you'd"
378,"think people would take their rubbish home with them, wouldn't you? "
379,DOCTOR: What's that? 
380,ACE: People come here for picnics and then leave their rubbish behind. 
381,DOCTOR: It's not the kind of place people come for picnics. 
382,(They go part way down the slope to pick up the oilskin package and its
383,contents.) 
384,"DOCTOR: Not ordinary tourists. Not English, anyway. "
385,ACE: Germans? German spies? 
386,DOCTOR: Look at the lettering. 
387,ACE: Greek? 
388,DOCTOR: Russian. 
389,ACE: But the Russians were on our side during the war. We'd better warn
390,them at the camp. 
391,DOCTOR: I think they already know. 
392,ACE: Where do you suppose the Russians are now? 
393,"DOCTOR: More to the point, where have they come from? From the north,"
394,like Vikings. I think I'd better go back to the church. 
395,ACE: Church? 
396,"DOCTOR: Well, if you find churches boring, you can stay here, but don't"
397,go into the water.
398,
399, [Decrypt room]
400,
401," (Cousin to Enigma, the calculating machine takes"
402,up the length of the room and a lot of the width. Commander Millington
403,enters.) 
404,JUDSON: The North Atlantic U-boats have changed ciphers again. That's
405,twice this month. 
406,MILLINGTON: Can we crack them? 
407,"JUDSON: Hmm. It may take a few days longer. Oh, they're using six"
408,rotors now instead of five. 
409,"MILLINGTON: Get inside the Nazi mind, Judson. Learn to think the way"
410,they think. It's the only way to understand their ciphers. 
411,"JUDSON: The machine can do it, if you'd be so kind as to authorise it,"
412,"sir. Thank you. Oh yes, the machine can do it. This is the"
413,"first. In the future there'll be many more computing machines, thinking"
414,machines. 
415,"MILLINGTON: Yes, but whose thoughts will they think?"
416,
417, [Maidens Point]
418,
419," (Ace, Jean and Phyllis are using a rope"
420,to climb down the cliff. Phyllis is nervous.) 
421,"JEAN: Come on, Phylly, don't be such a baby doll. You'll love it. It"
422,makes you feel all funny inside. 
423,"PHYLLIS: All right, but get ready to catch me. "
424,JEAN: All right. Come on. 
425,"ACE: Get a move on, we'll be here all day. Here, I'll catch you. Argh,"
426,not that quick! 
427,JEAN: You all right? 
428,(Phyllis gets to the bottom a bit quickly.) 
429,ACE: Want to do it again? 
430,PHYLLIS: No! 
431,"JEAN: Oh, come on Philly, don't be such a baby doll. You should hear"
432,what they call her at school. 
433,PHYLLIS: Jean! 
434,JEAN: Doesn't your uncle mind you coming down here by yourself? 
435,"ACE: Who? Oh, the Professor. No, he's all right really. "
436,PHYLLIS: That witch said we oughtn't to come here. 
437,PHYLLIS + JEAN: There's evil in the water! 
438,JEAN: Come on. Come swimming. Come for a swim.
439,PHYLLIS: All right. 
440,"ACE: Oi, wait for me! "
441,(They don't see the pale corpse of Petrossian lying amongst the rocks.)
442,
443, [Church vestry]
444,
445, (Reverend Wainwright is looking at an old book
446,"when the Doctor enters. He slams the door shut, making the Reverend"
447,jump and close the book.) 
448,WAINWRIGHT: I beg your pardon. I didn't hear you. 
449,DOCTOR: Possibly not. 
450,"WAINWRIGHT: What can I do for you, Doctor? "
451,DOCTOR: I'd like to know the answer. 
452,WAINWRIGHT: I'm afraid I don't understand. 
453,"DOCTOR: Afraid, yes, but of what? The Viking inscriptions? The curse? "
454,"WAINWRIGHT: Doctor, there are some questions better left unanswered. "
455,"DOCTOR: That may be so, but it's too late, isn't it? Someone's already"
456,translated the inscriptions. 
457,WAINWRIGHT: It's probably all nonsense. Some records that my
458,grandfather made when he was vicar of Saint Jude's at the end of the
459,last century. He translated the Viking inscriptions. I wish to heavens
460,he never had. 
461,(Wainwright hands the book to the Doctor to read.)
462,
463, [Maidens Point]
464,
465, (Jean and Phyllis are in swimming costumes. Ace
466,stays on shore fully dressed.) 
467,JEAN: Come on! Don't be such a baby doll. 
468,"ACE: No, swimming's stupid. "
469,PHYLLIS: It's lovely and warm. 
470,"ACE: Anyway, it's dangerous. Look. "
471,(Ace points to the large sign which reads Warning Dangerous
472,Undercurrents.) 
473,"JEAN: Oh, you're just a baby doll. "
474,(The girls swim off.) 
475,ACE: Stupid.
476,
477, [Church vestry]
478,
479, DOCTOR: (reads) We hope to return to the North
480,"Way, carrying home the oriental treasures from the Silk Lands in the"
481,"east, but the dark curse follows our dragon ship. "
482, [Underwater] 
483," DOCTOR : Black fog turned day into night, and"
484,the fingers of death reached out from the waters to reclaim the

622,"Berlin. Even down to the files. Oh, dreadful man. "
623,ACE: Commander Millington's a spy? 
624,"DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no, no. He's just trying to think the way the"

778,"ACE: And, we, it uses fewer characters. "

1423,"DOCTOR: Ah, just a little something to frighten off haemovores. "
1424,ACE: I thought vampires were scared of crucifixes. 
1425,"DOCTOR: No, no, it's not the crucifix that frightens them, it's the"
1426,"faith of the person carrying it. It creates a psychic barrier, just"
1427,like I did. 
1428,SORIN: Door's secure. 
1429,WAINWRIGHT: We're trapped. 
1430,DOCTOR: Ace? 
1431,ACE: The mine shaft. 
1432,DOCTOR: Correct. (The Doctor opens the secret doorway.) 
1433,"SORIN: Listen, I must go back to my men. "
1434,"WAINWRIGHT: You can't go back that way. Those creatures, they're,"
1435,they're inhuman. 
1436,"SORIN: I must try. If I fail, I fail. These two will stay with you. "
1437,"ACE: Professor, show him how to make the singing. "
1438,"DOCTOR: I can't. Either he believes absolutely, or he doesn't. "
1439,SORIN: I believe in the Revolution. 
1440,DOCTOR: Complete faith? No doubts? 
1441,"SORIN: Go. If we meet again, you will have your answer. Go. "
1442,"(The Doctor, Wainwright and the soldiers leave. Ace touches Sorin's"

1454,"ACE: If you want a job doing properly, get a girl to do it. Out of the"
1455,"way, boys. "
1456,"DOCTOR: Ace! Oh, don't antagonise her. It'll only make things worse. "

1474,DOCTOR: What's the matter? 
1475,"ACE: Well, if I get the top off this, then I can make up some more"
1476,nitro. 
1477,DOCTOR: Another explosion might bring the roof down on top of our
1478,heads.

1889,area where two Russians are. They die quickly but noisily. 
1890,"A little later, the fighting has finished. Millington and"
1891,Bates survey the dead.) 
1892,BATES: Are they Russians? 
1893,"MILLINGTON: Russians, German, British. They're enemy. "
1894," Sorin and Vershinin discover the last of their men,"
1895,all dead.) 
1896,SORIN: We are the last two. 
1897,VERSHININ: This isn't war. This is massacre. 
1898,SORIN: The Ultima machine has done this. 
1899,VERSHININ: Destroy it. 
1900,(They check their ammunition supply.) 
1901,SORIN: Go that way.

1905,"(Bates has followed Millington, and is"
1906,eavesdropping. The haemovore is there.) 
1907,MILLINGTON: Your creatures are killing my men! What is it? 
1908,JUDSON: We call him the Great Serpent. 
1909,MILLINGTON: And the Great Serpent shall rise from the sea and spew
1910,venom over all the Earth. 
1911,JUDSON: There's enough poison in here to contaminate the world forever.
1912,
1913, [Naval camp]
1914,
1915,(Bates runs up to the Doctor and Ace.) 
1916,BATES: They're insane. They're trying to control the world with
1917,chemical weapons. 
1918,"DOCTOR: All part of Fenric's evil game, no doubt, like this weather. "
1919,"BATES: I know. (Sorin comes up behind Bates, who turns to him.) "
1920,"BATES: Let's join forces, fight the real enemy. "
1921,SORIN: That's a really good idea. 
1922,ACE: So we're all on the same side again? 
1923,SORIN: You have the spirit of a fighter. And you wear our emblem. 
1924,"(Ace has a red star on her black jacket, which she is carrying.) "
1925,"ACE: Oh, it's not a real one. I bought it cheap in a market. "
1926,"SORIN: Have the real one, tovarich. "
1927,"(Sorin pins his own badge on her lapel, then takes her hand and gently"
1928,kisses it.)

1934,"LEIGH: It's all right, girls. We'll take over now. "
1935,(The Wrens turn around to show their pale faces and long nails. Once

1940, KATHLEEN: Ace! 
1941,DOCTOR: The chess set? 
1942,ACE: In the suitcase. 
1943,(The Doctor grabs the chess set and runs for the door.) 
1944,"KATHLEEN: Oh, don't leave me! "
1945,ACE: I can't leave them. I'll stay here. 
1946,"DOCTOR: Well, don't leave the hut."

1949,
1950, (Sorin sees the smashed radios then turns
1951,to discover Jean and Phyllis have been hiding behind the door.)

1959,leave when two haemovores enter.) 
1960,"CRANE: Oh no! Oh, please! Please! Please! "
1961,JUDSON: Nurse Crane. You've looked after me all these years. Almost a
1962,"mother, treating me like a child, humiliating me. I feel this is what"
1963,Doctor Judson would have wished. 
1964,(Possessed Judson gestures for the haemovores to do their work.) 
1965,"CRANE: Oh no! No, please! Argh!"

1968,
1969, ACE: We've got to do something about this
1970,room. 
1971,"KATHLEEN: All right. Let me just sort the baby out, okay? "
1972,ACE: Let's use the furniture. 
1973," KATHLEEN: Right, let's put that bunk up against the"
1974,door. 
1975,ACE: Okay. What about the wardrobe over the window? 
1976,KATHLEEN: Good idea. Let's use that and the other bunks up against the
1977,window. 
1978,ACE: Yeah.
1979,
1980, [Decrypt room]
1981,

1983,MILLINGTON: I'm afraid you've had a wasted journey. 
1984,(Millington shoots Vershinin.) 
1985,"MILLINGTON: But then you were never really our allies, were you? Your"
1986,people will always be the enemy.

1993,sit and wait.)

1995,empty house full of noises. Evil. Things I didn't understand.
1996,Undercurrents. 
1997,KATHLEEN: What kind of a world is this to bring up a child in? 
1998,(A haemovore breaks in a window.) 
1999,"ACE: Quick, the window! "
2000,(Ace runs to the opposite window and starts to climb out.) 
2001,"KATHLEEN: Ace, take Audrey. "

2011,
2012, ACE: In the jeep. Get in. Quick! 
2013,KATHLEEN: Where shall I go? What shall I do? 
2014,ACE: Go to London. My Nan'll look after you. 
2015,KATHLEEN: Where? 
2016,ACE: She lives in Streatham. Seventeen Old Terrace. Say it. 
2017,"KATHLEEN: Seventeen Old Terrace. Wait, Ace. I want you to have this. "

2028,
2029, JUDSON: The Time Lord has made his move.
2030,Take the poison. Carry it to the ocean. Release it into
2031,the waters. 
2032,HAEMOVORE: And the other haemovores? 
2033,"JUDSON: Oh yes, they've been so useful. How could we have"
2034,managed without them. You know how to kill them. 
2035,"(The haemovore concentrates. Outside, Jean and Phyllis scream and"
2036,"collapse, then crumble into dust before Ace's eyes.)"
2037,
2038, [Munitions bunker]
2039,
2040,(Judson enters.) 
2041,"JUDSON: Where is the game, Time Lord? "
2042,"DOCTOR: You couldn't resist it, could you? The game of traps. The"
2043,contest as before. One move. Find the winning move. Spring the trap on
2044,"me, if you can. "
2045,(The Doctor leaves Judson to pore over the chess board.)

2048,
2049,(Captain Bates has found Vershinin. Millington
2050,enters and he points his service revolver at his superior.) 
2051,"MILLINGTON: Are you going to use that gun? You know your problem,"
2052,Captain Bates? You don't know who the enemy is. A traitor is someone
2053,who doesn't know who the enemy is. 
2054,"(Millington raises his own weapon, a shot rings out and he falls.) "
2055,VERSHININ: But I do.
2056,
2057, [Tunnel]
2058,
2059, DOCTOR: I've been waiting. 
2060,HAEMOVORE: You know me? 
2061,"DOCTOR: Thousands of years in the future, the Earth lies dying, the"
2062,surface just a chemical slime. Half a million years of industrial
2063,progress. 
2064, HAEMOVORE: I am the last. The last living creature on
2065,"Earth. I watched my world dying with chemicals, and I could do nothing."
2066,My world is dead.
2067,
2068, [Munitions bunker]
2069,
2070, (Judson is concentrating on the chess set when Ace
2071,runs in. He doesn't look up.) 
2072,"JUDSON: Who is it? Is that you, Time Lord? Tell me the solution. The"
2073,"contest is, is too much for such a weak body. "
2074,ACE: I don't know the solution. 
2075,JUDSON: Tell me. Tell me the solution. 
2076,(Ace runs out again.)
2077,
2078, [Tunnel]
2079,
2080,  DOCTOR: You're very patient. Carried
2081,"back thousands of years in a time storm, to ninth century Transylvania,"
2082,and waiting till now. 
2083,"HAEMOVORE: Without the flask, I was trapped. "
2084,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, the flask. I trapped him like an evil genie. "
2085,HAEMOVORE: Only he can return me to the future. 
2086,"DOCTOR: And so, like a faithful servant, you follow the flask. "
2087,HAEMOVORE: A merchant bought it from Constantinople. I followed him
2088,"through Europe. I followed the Viking pirates who stole it, and I"
2089,followed it here. 
2090, DOCTOR: Another of Fenric's games. He carries you back
2091,"in a time storm to destroy the Earth's water with chemicals, to destroy"
2092,"your future. Think on it. Your Earth, your world, dying of a chemical"
2093,slime. This act will be the beginning of your end.
2094,
2095, [Decrypt room]
2096,
2097, BATES: I owe you one. 
2098,ACE: What's happened? Are you all right? 
2099,BATES: We're all right now. We're fighting together now. 
2100,"VERSHININ: War, a game played by politicians. We were just pawns in the"
2101,"game, but the pawns are fighting together now. Eh, comrade? "
2102,ACE: That's it. The solution. The winning move!
2103,
2104, [Munitions bunker]
2105,
2106,"(Sorin enters, carrying a rifle.) "
2107,JUDSON: Where have you been? 
2108,"SORIN: It's time to die, Fenric. "
2109,JUDSON: You don't understand. You don't know why you were selected for
2110,this mission. 
2111,SORIN: Because I speak English. My grandmother was English. 
2112,"JUDSON: Emily Wilson, granddaughter of Joseph Sundvik. You are touched"
2113,by the Curse of Fenric. I selected you. You are one of the Wolves of
2114,Fenric. 
2115,(Sorin takes aim.)
2116,
2117, [Decrypt room]
2118,
2119, BATES: Are you sure you can stand? 
2120,"VERSHININ: Workers of the world unite, comrade. "
2121,(They clasp hands.)
2122,
2123, [Munitions bunker]
2124,
2125, (Sorin is studying the problem when Ace enters.) 
2126,"ACE: Fenric would never have guessed the solution, anyway. "
2127,"SORIN: Tell me, tovarich. "
2128,ACE: A brilliant move. The black and white pawns don't fight each
2129,"other, they join forces. "
2130,(Sorin turns and reveals his glowing green eyes.) 
2131,"SORIN: Thank you, child. "
2132,(The Doctor enters.) 
2133,DOCTOR: Ace! 
2134,"SORIN: Black wins, Time Lord. "
2135,(He knocks over the white king and laughs. Lightning blasts through the
2136,roof and sets the board alight.) 
2137,ACE: What's happened? 
2138,"SORIN: The Wolves of Fenric, descendants of the Viking who first buried"
2139,"the flask, all pawns in my game. Doctor Judson, Commander Millington,"
2140,"the Ancient One, Captain Sorin, and now you. "
2141,(The Ancient One is behind Ace.) 
2142,ACE: Me? You can't! How? 
2143,"SORIN: The baby. In thirty years, the baby will be grown. She will have"
2144,a daughter. That daughter will be you. You've just created your own
2145,future. 
2146,(Sorin holds Audrey's photograph in front of Ace.) 
2147,"SORIN: The baby is your mother. The mother you hate. Kill them, slowly."
2148,
2149,"ACE: You don't stand a chance. Tell him, Doctor. He's got it wrong. "
2150,SORIN: The Time Lord has failed. The Wolves of Fenric have released me.
2151,
2152,ACE: The Doctor never fails. I've got faith in him. Complete faith. 
2153,SORIN: Kill them. 
2154,DOCTOR: It can't penetrate Ace's psychic force. 
2155,"SORIN: Time for the one final game, then. "
2156,(Sorin picks up a poison vial and holds it near Ace's head.) 
2157,"SORIN: The choice is yours, Time Lord. I shall kill you anyway, but if"
2158,"you would like the girl to live, kneel before me. "
2159,"ACE: I believe in you, Professor. "
2160,"SORIN: Kneel, if you want the girl to live! "
2161,DOCTOR: Kill her. 
2162,SORIN: The Time Lord finally understands. 
2163,DOCTOR: Do you think I didn't know? The chess set in Lady Peinforte's
2164,study? I knew. 
2165,"SORIN: Earlier than that, Time Lord. Before Cybermen, ever since Ice"
2166,"World, where you first met the girl. "
2167,DOCTOR: I knew. I knew she carried the evil inside her. Do you think
2168,I'd have chosen a social misfit if I hadn't known? She couldn't even
2169,"pass her chemistry exams at school, and yet she manages to create a"
2170,time storm in her bedroom. I saw your hand in it from the very
2171,beginning. 
2172,"ACE: Doctor, no. "
2173,"DOCTOR: She's an emotional cripple. I wouldn't waste my time on her,"
2174,unless I had to use her somehow. 
2175,ACE: No! 
2176,(Ace falls to her knees.) 
2177,SORIN: Kill them. 
2178,(The haemovore picks the payload of one of the bombs and walks towards
2179,"Sorin, who backs away.) "
2180,"SORIN: Kill them, do you hear me? "
2181,(It backs Sorin into the containment chamber.) 
2182,SORIN: No! No. I command you! 
2183,(The haemovore follows Sorin in and shuts the door behind them.) 
2184,SORIN: No! No! No! No. 
2185,"(The Ancient One drops the payload, breaking the vials and filling the"
2186,chamber with the deadly gas. They both die.) 
2187,DOCTOR: Come on. It's over. 
2188,ACE: Leave me alone! 
2189,DOCTOR: We've got to get out of here! 
2190,(The Doctor pulls Ace to her feet and pushes her outside.) 
2191,ACE: Leave me alone!
2192,
2193, [Naval camp]
2194,
2195,(They slither and fall in the mud as there is an
2196,explosion in the bunker.) 
2197,ACE: Couldn't even pass a chemistry exam. 
2198,"DOCTOR: I'd have done anything not to hurt you, but I had to save you"
2199,from Fenric's evil curse. Your faith in me was holding the haemovore
2200,back. 
2201,"ACE: You said I was an emotional cripple, a social misfit. "
2202,DOCTOR: I had to make you lose your belief in me. 
2203,ACE: Full marks for teenage psychology. 
2204,"DOCTOR: It's not true, believe me."
2205,
2206, [Maidens Point]
2207,
2208," ACE: I don't love her! She's my mum, and"
2209,I don't love her! What's wrong with me? Why can't I stop
2210,hating her? 
2211,DOCTOR: You loved the baby. 
2212,ACE: But I didn't know she was my mum! 
2213,"DOCTOR: Love and hate, frightening feelings, especially when they're"
2214,trapped struggling beneath the surface. Don't be frightened of the
2215,water. 
2216,(Ace pulls off her snood and dives in.)
2217,
2218, [Underwater] 
2219," KATHLEEN : Audrey. It's all right, darling. "
2220,ACE : I'll always love you. I'll always love you. I'll always love
2221,you. 
2222,"KATHLEEN : It's all right, darling. It's all right, darling. "
2223,ACE : I'll always love you.

2226,
2227, (Ace splashes to the shore.) 
2228,ACE: I'm not scared now.
