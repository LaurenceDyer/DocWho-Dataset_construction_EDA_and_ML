21, Episode One
22,
23, [Beach]
24,
25,(The Tardis has materialised in mid-air just
26,"offshore, and set itself down gently on the water. The Doctor, Jamie"
27,and Victoria use a rubber dinghy to row to the shingle beach nearby.) 
28,"DOCTOR: There. Come one, Victoria, out you get. "
29,JAMIE: Trust you to bring us right down in the middle of the sea. 
30,DOCTOR: The Tardis is perfectly capable of floating you know. 
31,VICTORIA: Where are we exactly? 
32,"DOCTOR: Oh England, undoubtedly. "
33,"JAMIE: Aye, you can tell by the weather. "
34,DOCTOR: And the white cliffs. 
35,VICTORIA: We always seem to land on this planet. 
36,"JAMIE: Aye, it's always England. I think by the hammering the Tardis"
37,"has got, you've gone and spiked it. Hey, where are you going? "
38,(Something further along the beach has caught the Doctor's attention.) 
39,JAMIE: Hey what's all this stuff Doctor? 
40,"VICTORIA: Foam, you silly. You often get it on the sea shore. "
41,"JAMIE: Aye, but not in big lumps like this, hey Doctor? "
42,"DOCTOR: No, not usually, Jamie. (He scoops some up.) Hey Jamie, feel"
43,that. 
44,(The Doctor pushes the foam into Jamie's face.) 
45,JAMIE: Right. 
46,(And the three have a foam fight up the beach. Then Jamie sees
47,something further along.) 
48,"JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, what's that? May be that's where the foam's coming"
49,from. 
50,"DOCTOR: Oh, I hardly think so, Jamie. "
51,"JAMIE: Well, let's go and see. "
52,(They come to a large steel pipe which curves up out of the sand and
53,into the face of the cliff.)
54,JAMIE: What is it? 
55,"DOCTOR: It's just what it says, Jamie. It's EuroSea Gas. "
56,"JAMIE: Gas from the sea? Oh, who are you trying to kid? "
57,VICTORIA: So it's nothing to do with the foam then. 
58,"DOCTOR: No, no, I shouldn't think so. I wonder what that is? "
59,"(The Doctor peers at a large black metal box fastened to the pipe, then"
60,tries to open it.) 
61,JAMIE: Will it not budge? 
62,"DOCTOR: No, it won't touch it, I'm afraid, Jamie. Ah well, have to use"
63,this. 
64,JAMIE: What's that? 
65,DOCTOR: It's a sonic screwdriver. Never fails. 
66,(The Doctor activates the wand-like device and the screws unwind
67,themselves out of the box.) 
68,"DOCTOR: There we are. Neat isn't it? All done by sound waves. Now, what"
69,have we got here. Oh yes. 
70,JAMIE: What is it? What's that noise? 
71,"DOCTOR: I don't know, Jamie. "
72,"(The Doctor closes the box, gets a stethoscope from his pockets and"
73,listens to the pipe. It sounds like a heart beat.) 
74,VICTORIA: I can hear it too. 
75,"DOCTOR: Yes. It's probably only throbbing from a pump, you know. "
76,"VICTORIA: Doctor, please hurry up. I don't like this place. It's so"
77,quiet. I feel as if we're being watched. 
78,"DOCTOR: All right, Victoria. Now then, Jamie. "
79,"(They are being watched, through the telescopic sight of a remotely"
80,controlled rifle which is relaying the image to a television screen.
81,The rifle moves to put its cross-hairs on the Doctor. The Doctor is
82,"shot in the shoulder, and falls.) "
83,VICTORIA: Doctor! 
84,(Jamie and Victoria are also shot.)
85,
86, [Control hall]
87,
88,(Victoria wakes. She is lying on the floor of a
89,brightly lit room with two armed guards standing over her.) 
90,VICTORIA: Doctor? Doctor? 
91,"DOCTOR: Victoria? Jamie, you there? "
92,"JAMIE: Oh, I think so. "
93,VICTORIA: I can't move. My legs. 
94,JAMIE: What happened?? What do you want? 
95,"DOCTOR: Would someone kindly tell us where we are, please? Why don't"
96,you answer? 
97,"JAMIE: Come on, where are we? "
98,VICTORIA: What have they done? Can't move. 
99,"DOCTOR: I think we've been tranquillised, Victoria. "
100,JAMIE: Eh? 
101,DOCTOR: Tranquillised. 
102,JAMIE: Who do they think they are? 
103,ROBSON: We should be the ones asking the questions. I shall expect
104,quite a lot of answers. 
105,JAMIE: What is this place? 
106,ROBSON: You mean you don't know? 
107,JAMIE: If only I could just get up. 
108,ROBSON: I wouldn't try if I were you. 
109,"DOCTOR: You know, in this position it's just a little difficult to"
110,communicate. 
111,"HARRIS: Shall we give them some U4, sir? "
112,DOCTOR: Eh? 
113,"ROBSON: Yes, do that Mister Harris. "
114,JAMIE: What's U4? 
115,VICTORIA: Oh no. 
116,"DOCTOR: I think it's all right, I think it's the antidote. "
117,"VICTORIA: No, please. "
118,"DOCTOR: Anyway, there's nothing we can do about it, you know. Oh yes,"
119,"thank you. Yes, that's better, thank you. Thank you very much. Yes. "
120,"(Revived by the antidote gas, the travellers stand.) "
121,"ROBSON: You were on the beach by the pipe line, in a restricted area."
122,Now why? 
123,"VICTORIA: We were lost, that's all. "
124,ROBSON: You were tampering with the emergency release valve remote
125,control. You're a saboteur. 
126,VICTORIA: He's not. He's a doctor. 
127,DOCTOR: I can assure you. I was only being curious. 
128,HARRIS: I don't really think how they could have anything to do with
129,the fall in pressure 
130,"ROBSON: When I want your opinion, Harris, I'll ask for it. In the"
131,"meantime, lock them up in one of the cabins. I'll interrogate them"
132,"later. And you lot, get back to work. "
133,JAMIE: Is he always as charming as that? 
134,"HARRIS: We're in something of an emergency at the moment. You see,"
135,we've just lost contact with one of our rigs at sea. 
136,DOCTOR: You mean communications have broken down? 
137,"HARRIS: No, that's what's curious about it. As far as we can tell our"
138,video link is functioning normally. The crew just aren't answering. 
139,"VICTORIA: You can't blame us for that, surely. "
140,HARRIS: There's also been a drop in pressure in the feed lines from the
141,rigs. You were seen tampering with a release valve on the pipe line. 
142,DOCTOR: I told you I was merely being curious. 
143,HARRIS: Were you? 
144,JAMIE: Are you calling us liars? 
145,"HARRIS: No, but you must admit your sudden appearance here inside our"
146,restricted area is suspicious. 
147,VICTORIA: That's no reason to shoot us down like animals. 
148,"HARRIS: Maybe not, but we were under a security alert and Mister"
149,"Robson's, well. under considerable pressure himself. I'm sorry but I"
150,shall have to do as he says and lock you up. 
151,DOCTOR: Oh dear. 
152,"HARRIS: Would you follow me? Come along, this way. "
153,(Harris leads the way and the two armed guards follow. A warning light
154,starts to glow on a control panel.) 
155,[Compound entrance]
156,
157,(Harris's wife is stopped from leaving.) 
158,"GUARD: May I see your pass please, madam? "
159,MAGGIE: Pass? 
160,GUARD: I have instructions that no one is to leave or enter the
161,compound without a written pass from Chief Robson. Not until after the
162,emergency. 
163,MAGGIE: But you know who I am. My husband is second in command to Chief
164,Robson. 
165,"GUARD: Yes Mrs Harris, I know. "
166,MAGGIE: Then let me pass. Please. 
167,"GUARD: Sorry, madam. I think you should return to the residential"
168,block.
169,
170, [Crew bunk room]
171,
172,"HARRIS: I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do to"
173,help you until you tell me what you were doing with that release valve
174,on the pipe line. 
175,DOCTOR: It wasn't the valve I was interested in. 
176,HARRIS: Oh? 
177,DOCTOR: I heard a movement coming from inside the pipes. 
178,"HARRIS: A movement? (to guard) Oh, it's all right. You can go. "
179,"DOCTOR: Yes, movement. Don't ask me what it was. "
180,"HARRIS: Well, I'm not sure what you re trying to suggest, but I can"
181,assure you marine life couldn't possibly get inside the pipe line tube.
182,It would never get pass the drill pumps. 
183,"JAMIE: Aye, that's as maybe, but there was something inside that tube"
184,because I heard it too. 
185,VICTORIA: And so did I. 
186,"DOCTOR: But if the pressure is down in the pipes, perhaps that's the"
187,reason why? Perhaps marine life has got into the pipes. 
188,"HARRIS: But that's impossible. We spent years of time, money and"
189,research into perfecting our emergency system. 
190,"DOCTOR: Well, perhaps there's a fracture in the pipes. A break, and"
191,something's got in that way. 
192,"HARRIS: Oh, I doubt it. "
193,"DOCTOR: Mister Harris, I don't wish to appear interfering but don't you"
194,think it'd be a good idea to turn off the gas? At least until you've
195,had a chance to check. 
196,HARRIS: Chief Robson would never agree to that. 
197,DOCTOR: Why not? 
198,"HARRIS: Well, he doesn't believe in working to the book. He prides"
199,himself that the flow has never been shut off ever since he took
200,charge. 
201,DOCTOR: He sounds a very silly man. 
202,HARRIS: But he appears to be right about one thing. You seem to know
203,quite a lot about our business. 
204, [Control hall]
205,
206,PRICE: Chief? 
207,ROBSON: Yes? 
208,"PRICE: We've gained contact with Rig D. Come in, Rig D. Come in,"
209,"please. Rig D, can you hear me please? "
210,(There is interference on the signal.) 
211,CARNEY : Yes. Rig D to HQ. I can hear you. 
212,ROBSON: Carney? What the dickens is going on out there? 
213,"CARNEY : Everything's quite all right, Mister Robson. "
214,ROBSON: What? 
215,CARNEY : We have the situation under control. 
216,"ROBSON: Will you speak up, man. I can't hear a word you're saying. "
217,CARNEY : Don't worry. 
218,"ROBSON: Price, are we losing volume? "
219,"PRICE: No, sir. I don't understand it. Will you speak a little louder,"
220,Mister Carney? 
221,CARNEY : Everything is under control. 
222,ROBSON: Carney? What happened to the emergency crew we sent you? Have
223,they arrived yet? 
224,CARNEY : Yes. Yes. But they must stay here for the time
225,being. 
226,ROBSON: They what? 
227,CARNEY : We've had a slight accident. Two men out of
228,action. 
229,"ROBSON: Now listen, Carney. You get that rig fixed A1 and quick. "
230,CARNEY : But it will take some time. 
231,ROBSON: What? What did you say? What's wrong with this thing. 
232,"PRICE: I don't know, sir. It must be their end. He seems to be"
233,whispering. 
234,CARNEY : Everything's under control. 
235,"ROBSON: Carney, speak up man! "
236,CARNEY : Everything's under control. 
237,ROBSON: Carney! 
238,CARNEY : Everything's under control. 
239,ROBSON: Carney! 
240,"PRICE: I think we've lost contact again, sir. "
241,"ROBSON: Well fix it, man. "
242,(Harris enters.) 
243,ROBSON: Price is getting too old for his job. 
244,"HARRIS: Mister Robson, I think we should turn off the gas flow coming"
245,from the rigs and make a check. 
246,"ROBSON: You think what, Mister Harris? "
247,"HARRIS: That Doctor chap, the stranger. He said he heard a movement"
248,coming from inside the pipe line on the beach. 
249,"ROBSON: Oh, did he now. Did he say what he thought it was? Mice? "
250,CHIEF: Chief? She's down a further three. Pressure's on just one fifty
251,seven. 
252,ROBSON: One fifty seven? Are you sure? 
253,"CHIEF: Yes, sir. "
254,HARRIS: That means the gas flow pressure is down at the rate of three
255,percent every 
256,CHIEF: Twenty minutes. 
257,HARRIS: Doesn't this prove that something must be blocking the pipe
258,line? 
259,"ROBSON: It proves nothing of the sort. It's probably a faulty gauge,"
260,that's all. Check it. 
261,"HARRIS: Look, at least give us the benefit of the doubt. "
262,ROBSON: When you want to find out about pipe lines and rigs Mister
263,"Harris, the thing to do is to go out to sea and work on them. "
264,"HARRIS: Look, I'm merely saying that if something had got into the tube"
265,then we should check 
266,ROBSON: You let me worry about that. 
267,"HARRIS: But Mister Robson, please listen. Look, this ties up with what"
268,"I've been trying to tell you. For three weeks now, there's been a"
269,"regular and increasing build up of fall in pressure. Look, I think you"
270,should at least look at my calculations. The time ratio of the
271,increases and falls corresponds to form a definite progressive pattern.
272,
273,ROBSON: So? 
274,HARRIS: I'll get them. 
275,(There is an open briefcase nearby.) 
276,"ROBSON: What are you trying to prove, Harris? That I don't know my job?"
277,
278,"HARRIS: No, sir, just that I do know mine. It's your decision whether"
279,to take notice of my work but I must put it on record that I have
280,offered the information. 
281,(A white gloved hand takes some papers from the briefcase.) 
282,"ROBSON: Don't threaten me, boy. I've eaten upstarts like you for"
283,"breakfast. You think you can baffle me with your little bits of paper,"
284,"don't you. All right, you go ahead and get them and I'll show you where"
285,you've gone wrong. 
286,(Harris goes to get the file.) 
287,ROBSON: Did you make a thorough check? 
288,"CHIEF: Yes, I checked it. Seems to be working properly. "
289,HARRIS: It's gone. 
290,CHIEF: Doesn't seem to be anything wrong with her. 
291,HARRIS: It's gone. The file's gone. 
292,"ROBSON: Well, well, well. Has it now. "
293,HARRIS: I'm sure I put it in here this morning. I must have left the
294,file on my desk at home. I'll go home and get it. 
295,ROBSON: You won't. You'll stay here. I'm not doing your job as well as
296,my own. 
297,"HARRIS: What's the matter, sir? Are you scared that I might prove you"
298,wrong? 
299,"ROBSON: No, you go ahead. But you'd better have something more than a"
300,"high flown theory, because if you haven't I'm going to take you and"
301,chop you up into little pieces and throw you back to your crummy little
302,university. All right? 
303, [Crew bunk room]
304,
305,(Jamie is standing on the Doctor's shoulders.) 
306,DOCTOR: I've got it. 
307,(He passes down a grille taken from an opening above the door.) 
308,DOCTOR: Can you see anyone? 
309,JAMIE: All clear. 
310,DOCTOR: Do you think you can make it? 
311,JAMIE: Of course I can make it. Hold on. 
312,"VICTORIA: Don't bother, Jamie. I can do it with this. "
313,JAMIE: Pick a lock with A hair pin? Don't be daft. 
314,(Jamie slips. The Doctor cries out in pain.) 
315,VICTORIA: Clumsy. 
316,(Victoria works on the lock as Jamie sticks his head out into the
317,corridor.)
318,
319, [Refinery corridor]
320,
321,"HARRIS: Maggie, where have you been? I've been"
322,trying to contact you. 
323,MAGGIE: I was on my way to the village but Robson's clamped down on
324,security. I'm just coming to find you to get a pass. 
325,"HARRIS: Yes, there's been a bit of a flap on. "
326,MAGGIE: Well can I have a pass? 
327,"HARRIS: Not at the moment. Look, could you do something for me? "
328,"MAGGIE: Yes, what is it? "
329,HARRIS: There's a file. It's probably in the middle drawer of my desk
330,in the study. Could you get it and bring it to me at the control room? 
331,"MAGGIE: All right, darling. What's the panic? "
332,HARRIS: I'll explain later. Don't be long. 
333,"MAGGIE: All right, darling. "
334,"(Maggie watches Harris leave, then heads off.)"
335,
336, [Crew bunk room]
337,
338,(Jamie stopped trying to get through the grille
339,because the previous scene was right outside their door.) 
340,"VICTORIA: Oh, he's stuck. "
341,"DOCTOR: No, he's not. Are you ready, Jamie? "
342,JAMIE: Yeah. 
343,DOCTOR: Right. 
344,"(The Doctor gives Jamie a huge shove, and he falls through the grille"
345,into the corridor. Then the door opens.) 
346,VICTORIA: Told you not to bother. 
347,"DOCTOR: Sorry about that, Jamie. "
348, [Harrises' quarters]
349,
350,(Maggie looks for her husband's file in the study.
351,It's a mess.) 
352,MAGGIE: Typical. 
353,(She finds the file in a different drawer than Harris said. It has
354,something inside it. Maggie opens it and drops it when she is stung.) 
355,MAGGIE: Seaweed? 
356,"(She carefully picks up the file and the seaweed, then goes to the"
357,"garden door and throws the seaweed onto the patio. Unnoticed, the"
358,seaweed bubbles and writhes.)
359,
360, [Impeller room]
361,
362,VAN LUTYENS: (Dutch) Mister Robson? Mister Robson?
363,Could I speak with you please? 
364,ROBSON: van Lutyens. I thought you were out at the control rig. 
365,VAN LUTYENS: I just got back on the supply boat. 
366,ROBSON: Something wrong? 
367,VAN LUTYENS: I'm not quite sure. The men out there seem very restless. 
368,ROBSON: Restless? What are you talking about? 
369,"VAN LUTYENS: You lost contact with Rig D, didn't you? "
370,ROBSON: Yes. It was only a temporary fault. We regained contact within
371,the hour. 
372,"VAN LUTYENS: Well, why didn't you tell us that? Unusual incidents like"
373,that only cause tension on the rigs. 
374,ROBSON: Don't tell me what happened out on the rigs. I spent four years
375,on one of those things without a break. 
376,VAN LUTYENS: Then you should know better than anyone how important it
377,is to keep up the morale of the crews. 
378,"ROBSON: What do you want me to do, wipe their noses for them? Mind your"
379,"own business,"
380,Van Lutyens. 
381,VAN LUTYENS: Mister Robson. I think you're forgetting we also have an
382,interest in EuroSea Gas. 
383, [Control hall] 
384,ROBSON: We? 
385,"VAN LUTYENS: I'm here for the Dutch Government, not for myself. "
386,"ROBSON: You're here to offer me your expert advice, not to spread alarm"
387,amongst my crews. 
388,VAN LUTYENS: How dare you say that to me? 
389,ROBSON: I didn't ask you to come here. It was Megan Jones and those
390,fools on the board. I said it wouldn't work and it never has. 
391,VAN LUTYENS: Only because you are too proud to accept advice. 
392,"ROBSON: Let's get one thing straight, my friend. When I need your"
393,advice I'll ask for it. 
394,(Robson walks away.) 
395,VAN LUTYENS: U stomme pompouze idiot Engelsman. 
396,[Control hall walkway]
397,
398,"(From the walkway above the control hall, the"
399,"Doctor, Jamie and Victoria watch van Lutyens leave.) "
400,JAMIE: What was all that? 
401,"DOCTOR: I think he's Dutch, Jamie, and I don't think he likes the"
402,English very much. 
403,(The Doctor gestures Jamie to keep quiet as Price answers an incoming
404,call.)
405,
406,[Control hall]
407,
408,PRICE: Control. 
409,"BAXTER : Chief Baxter, Control Rig. Is Mister Robson there? "
410,"PRICE: Yes, sir. Mister Robson, sir. "
411,ROBSON: Yes? 
412,"PRICE: Chief Baxter, Control Rig, sir. "
413,"ROBSON: Right. Yes, Baxter, what is it? "
414,"BAXTER : Has Mister Lutyens arrive there yet, sir? "
415,ROBSON: Yes. Why? 
416,"BAXTER : Then he'll have told you how the men feel, sir. "
417,"ROBSON: Now listen, Baxter. I'm in charge of this outfit, not van"
418,Lutyens. You take orders from me not him. 
419,"BAXTER : Yes, sir. But there's something else. "
420,ROBSON: What else? 
421,BAXTER : Something seems to have got inside the pipe line. 
422,ROBSON: Inside the pipe line? 
423,BAXTER : We've all heard it. 
424,ROBSON: Heard what? 
425,BAXTER : This sound. At first I thought it was something to do with
426,the pumps but it isn't. It's a peculiar sound. A sort of regular
427,"thumping, pulsating, like a heart beat. "
428,[Control hall walkway]
429,
430,DOCTOR: That's the noise I heard on the beach. 
431,"VICTORIA: What is it, Doctor? "
432,"DOCTOR: I don't know but we're going to find out. Come on, Jamie. Oh"
433,"Victoria, no. Not you. "
434,VICTORIA: Why not? 
435,DOCTOR: I think it'd be better if you stayed back in the bunk room.
436,Please. 
437,"VICTORIA: Oh, all right. "
438,"JAMIE: Oh, and Victoria? "
439,VICTORIA: Yes? 
440,"(Jamie laughs. Victoria reluctantly goes back towards the bunk room,"
441,but as soon as Jamie and the Doctor are out of sight she turns around
442,and goes exploring.)
443,
444, [Harrises' quarters]
445,
446,(Maggie is feeling ill after being stung by the
447,seaweed. She goes to the videophone.) 
448,PRICE : Control. 
449,"MAGGIE: Mrs Harris here, married block 420. Could I speak to my husband"
450,please?
451,
452, [Control hall]
453,
454,ROBSON: Have you recalibrated? 
455,PRICE: I've just done phase two. 
456,ROBSON: Better start on phase three. 
457,HARRIS: Mister Robson. 
458,"ROBSON: Yes, Harris. Where are your figures? "
459,"HARRIS: Oh I haven't got them, sir. I sent my wife for them, but she's"
460,not well. I wondered if I could go and 
461,"ROBSON: No I would not. Tell her to call a doctor, not pester you. "
462,"HARRIS: But Doctor Patterson is still out at Rig D, sir. "
463,"ROBSON: Well, tell her to get one in from the outside. "
464,"HARRIS: But you've still go the compound on full emergency alert,"

472,"Victoria, creeping along the corridor. She hears someone approaching"
473,and goes through the nearest door. The oxygen-rich atmosphere is
474,"stifling, so Victoria starts closing the valves. She hears a sound"
475,behind her and sees the tall thin man in the gas mask leave. He locks
476,her in.) 
477,"VICTORIA: Oh, well. "
478,"(Victoria unpins her hair and starts to pick the lock. Outside, the"

488,"DOCTOR: It's an impeller, Jamie. It pumps gas from the main pipe line"

492,(Next door is a massive room full of pipes and

495,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, they all are. It's a continuation of the pipe we"
496,found on the beach. 
497,"JAMIE: That bit there, you can see inside the pipe. "

546,"CHIEF: Mister Robson, in here. Gas. "
547,ROBSON: Check it then. Find out what it is. 
548,"VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor, a horrible creature. "
549,DOCTOR: Creature? 
550,VICTORIA: Didn't you see it? It was in there. It came straight towards
551,"me covered with seaweed and foam and this horrible hissing sound, and"
552,then I screamed. I didn't know. 
553,"DOCTOR: All right, Victoria. "
554,ROBSON: Creature? The girl's hysterical. 
555,CHIEF: Mister Robson? They're empty. The seals are broken. 
556,ROBSON: Why were you in there? 
557,VICTORIA: I was hiding. I heard someone coming so I went in. 
558,ROBSON: This door is always kept locked. You broke in. You emptied
559,"those cylinders, didn't you. "
560,"VICTORIA: Oh, no, no. It was open and someone locked it behind me. "
561,JAMIE: She's telling the truth. The door was locked from the outside. 
562,VAN LUTYENS : Mister Robson. 
563,"DOCTOR: Yes, it was locked. "
564,VAN LUTYENS: This room wasn't full of oxygen when we came in here. It
565,was another gas of a toxic composition. 
566,"ROBSON: All right, if it was a poison gas, where did it come from? "
567,CHIEF: What about up there? 
568,VAN LUTYENS: The ventilator's open. Good. Did you open the ventilator? 
569,"VICTORIA: No, it opened by its self. "

579,MAGGIE: I don't remember. 
580,HARRIS: You said you were stung or something. 
581,"MAGGIE: Did I? Why, I don't. Yes, yes it must have been. I went to get"

595,HARRIS: I'd better get you a doctor. I'll go back and see if Doctor
596,Patterson's returned yet from Rig D. Will you be all right?

601,but the pounding gets louder in her head. She gets up and goes to the

606,[Impeller room]
607,
608,ROBSON: So what's the panic? 
609,"CHIEF: It's the pump, sir. The revs have dropped. "
610,VAN LUTYENS: The pump is slowing down? 
611,"CHIEF: Yes, she's not holding steady even now. I don't understand it. "
612,"ROBSON: Well, don't stand there thinking about it, man. Do a complete"
613,check. 
614,"DOCTOR: Excuse me, may I say something? When I was in the pipe room a"
615,"short while ago, I'm sure I heard a movement coming from inside the"
616,pipe. 
617,VAN LUTYENS: What kind of movement? 
618,"DOCTOR: Well, the same as I heard on the beach. A sort of thumping"
619,sound. 
620,VAN LUTYENS: But that's what they heard out at the rigs. 
621,ROBSON: What you heard and what everybody else heard was a mechanical
622,fault somewhere along the line. 
623,DOCTOR: Then why did they hear it out at the rigs? 
624,"ROBSON: Because, my friend, underneath this impeller shaft is a vast"
625,steel gasometer buried in the earth. It acts like an echo chamber.
626,It'll make the sound of a pin dropping sound like that of a thunder
627,clap. It travels along the pipe. 
628,"DOCTOR: Oh, this wasn't a mechanical sound. "
629,"ROBSON: All right then, suppose there is something in the pipe. A fish"
630,or something. What do you expect me to do about it? 
631,DOCTOR: Turn off the gas flow. At least until you've had a chance to
632,investigate. 
633,ROBSON: That's out of the question. 
634,"VAN LUTYENS: Mister Robson, if there is something in the pipeline "
635,ROBSON: We do not turn off the flow and that is final. 
636,"CHIEF: Mister Robson, sir. "
637,ROBSON: Yes? 
638,CHIEF: Down another half. 
639,"ROBSON: It must be a mechanical fault. Get a couple of men and check,"
640,"man, check. "
641,"VAN LUTYENS: If you allow the pressure to build up in the pipeline,"
642,you'll blow the whole rig sky-high. 
643,DOCTOR: And blow us with it. 
644,VAN LUTYENS: All because you're too stubborn to turn off the gas. 
645,"ROBSON: All right, what do you think it is? One of these creatures the"
646,hysterical girl thought she saw? 
647,"DOCTOR: Well, who knows."

651,JAMIE: You mean to say that this place supplies all
652,the gas for the whole of the south of England? 
653,PRICE: And the whole of Wales. 
654,VICTORIA: What are all those lights for? 
655,"PRICE: Well, that's a plan of the entire compound and each of those"
656,lights represents a remote control camera that I can switch through to
657,this screen if I want to look at any particular area. Like this. 
658,JAMIE: Oh. Where are all these rigs people talk about? 
659,"PRICE: Well, they're out at sea, of course, but that plan over there"
660,shows you the relative position of all the rigs under our command. 
661,VICTORIA: What's the big one in the middle? 
662,"PRICE: Well that's the central control rig complex, the sort of the"
663,nerve centre of the whole thing. The other rigs feed her with gas and
664,"she in turn pumps it to us via the main pipeline, see. "
665,VICTORIA: How awful to have to live out at sea. And lonely. 
666,"PRICE: Oh, I don't know. Mister Robson once spent four years on one of"
667,the early rigs without ever going ashore. 
668,"JAMIE: Aye, that would account for quite a lot. "

670,"ROBSON: Hey, you. Come in here and give a hand. "
671,JAMIE: Doesn't that man ever call anyone by their name? 
672,"PRICE: Well, it probably means trouble if he does. No, he's all right,"

729,in the pipeline. 
730,VAN LUTYENS: She's almost up to capacity. 
731,CHIEF: She'll blow herself wide open.

813,"ROBSON: Oh, so that's it. You've been talking with Harris, eh? "
814,"VAN LUTYENS: Ja, Mister Harris did show me his figures. Only because"
815,"you refused to listen to him. That's why I went out to the Control Rig,"

826,as much contempt?

848,HARRIS: What's the matter with her? 
849,"DOCTOR: Well, she's in some sort of coma. Possibly because of this gas."
850,It was toxic. 
851,HARRIS: It isn't possible there could have been a gas leak in the flat.
852,"Besides, natural gas isn't toxic. "
853,"DOCTOR: Well, this isn't natural gas. This is the gas we found when"
854,Victoria was locked in the Oxygen room.

871,DOCTOR: It's still wet. 
872,HARRIS: Perhaps it's the same sort that Maggie was talking about. 
873,"DOCTOR: No, don't touch it. "
874,HARRIS: Why? 
875,"DOCTOR: Well in the first place, you don't want to get stung like your"
876,"wife, do you? And in the second place, whoever put it in your file"
877,meant you to touch it. 
878,HARRIS: But that's ridiculous. Wait a minute. I was sure I put that
879,"file in my briefcase this morning, but it wasn't there when I went to"
880,get it. I was on my way home when I met Maggie. But why? Why should
881,anyone want me to get stung by a piece of seaweed? 
882,VICTORIA: Well I hate the stuff. It's so slimy and horrid. 
883,"JAMIE: Och away, you've seen seaweed before, haven't you? There was"
884,loads of it down by the pipeline this morning.

909,frightened of him or something? 
910,"CHIEF: No, Mister Van Lutyens, I just respect his judgement. "
911,"VAN LUTYENS: Well, I'm sorry, Chief. Could I have a word with you in"
912,private? 
913,"CHIEF: Well, I "
914,VAN LUTYENS: It's important. 
915,CHIEF: Check the feed valve.
916,
917,[Control hall]
918,
919,VAN LUTYENS: I've been looking at the installation
920,"plan, and the impeller intake valve in particular. I think I know where"
921,the blockage may be. 
922,CHIEF: All right. 
923,"VAN LUTYENS: Well, this valve is at the base of the main shaft and"
924,"leads directly to the intake, ja? "
925,CHIEF: Mmm hmm. 
926,"VAN LUTYENS: Well, as far as I can see there is no point between that"
927,valve and the Control Rig where a blockage could occur big enough to
928,stop the impeller. 
929,CHIEF: Apart from the under-sea emergency valve. 
930,VAN LUTYENS: But you've got remote control observation on those and
931,"they are free, ja? "
932,CHIEF: Mmm. 
933,VAN LUTYENS: So the impeller intake must be at fault. 
934,CHIEF: It's possible. 
935,"VAN LUTYENS: Possible, man? It's the only answer. What we have to do is"
936,to go down and free that valve. 
937,CHIEF: I'll have to check with Mister Robson. 
938,VAN LUTYENS: Robson! Robson! What's the matter with you? Are you
939,children? Can't you do anything on your own initiative? 
940,"CHIEF: Look, I can't send men down there without his approval. "
941,VAN LUTYENS: Can you not also blow your nose without approval? 
942,"CHIEF: Now listen to me, Mister Van Lutyens. I've worked for Mister"
943,Robson a long time. We were out there on those rigs together in the
944,early days. You may think he's wrong to run this place in the way he
945,"does, but I trust him. And I take orders from him purely because I"
946,trust his judgement. No other reason. 
947,"VAN LUTYENS: I'm sorry, Chief, I shouldn't have said that. You forgive"
948,"me, ja? Now what I would like you to do is to go to Mister Robson and"
949,"say we think we know where the blockage is, and get official permission"
950,to inspect the bass of the shaft. 
951,"CHIEF: Just a minute, that's your theory, that's not mine. "
952,"VAN LUTYENS: It's the only possibility. Anyway that sound you heard, it"
953,must have come from the bass of the shaft. 
954,CHIEF: If the main valve is open it could be an echo from any one of
955,those rigs. 
956,VAN LUTYENS: If it is open! But you do not know that it is open and you
957,will not know until you go down and check. 
958,"CHIEF: Well, I suppose I could put it to him. "
959,(The heartbeat starts up again.) 
960,VAN LUTYENS: You're not going to tell me that that is a mechanical
961,fault. 
962,CHIEF: I'll go and see him. 
963,VAN LUTYENS: He's in his cabin. 
964,[Refinery corridor]
965,
966,ROBSON: Chief! What's the matter? 
967,"CHIEF: Mister Robson, that noise in the impeller, it's started again. I"
968,"think we should go down and check the main valve, sir. "
969,"ROBSON: Oh, you do, do you? "
970,"CHIEF: Well, that's where we think the blockage is. "
971,ROBSON: We? 
972,"CHIEF: Well, Mister van "
973,"ROBSON: Mister van Lutyens. Yes, I thought he'd get his nose in. Come"
974,on.
975,
976,[Impeller room]
977,
978,ROBSON: You lot get back to work. Mister Van
979,"Lutyens, I want to talk to you. "
980,"VAN LUTYENS: Mister Robson, there is something alive in the pipeline. "
981,ROBSON: You're out of your mind. There's nothing down there. 
982,"CHIEF: I promise you, sir, I did hear something. "
983,"ROBSON: You've been unnerving my crew. Now you, get out! "
984,VAN LUTYENS: Listen. 
985,ROBSON: That's it. Did you hear what I said? 
986,"VAN LUTYENS: Now listen, will you? (heartbeats) It's down there, in the"
987,"darkness, in the pipeline, waiting. "

990, [Harrises' quarters]
991,
992,"(In the bedroom, Jamie bends down to examine the"
993,seaweed on the carpet.) 
994,"DOCTOR: No, Jamie, don't touch it. "
995,JAMIE: But it's only a bit of seaweed. 
996,"DOCTOR: Yes, unless it really did move like Victoria said. "
997,"JAMIE: Oh, how can it move. It's not a living thing, is it? "
998,"DOCTOR: Everything in the sea is living, Jamie. "
999,"VICTORIA: Well, it did move. It gave me a shock. It was like a spider. "
1000,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, we're not taking any chances. Hold that for me, will"
1001,you? 
1002,JAMIE: What's this for? 
1003,DOCTOR: We're going to take a closer look at this weed. Now bring the
1004,bag down here. Right onto the floor. That's it. Now don't let it touch
1005,your fingers. Careful. Slowly does it. Mind your fingers. There. 
1006,JAMIE: What are you going to do with it? 
1007,DOCTOR: We're going to see if an ordinary piece of seaweed really can
1008,move. 
1009,"HARRIS: Doctor, my wife, will she be all right? "
1010,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, I think so, yes. I don't think there's any panic, but"
1011,I'd get her under medical supervision if I was you. 
1012,"HARRIS: Yes, I'll go back to the Medicare centre at the compound and"
1013,arrange for her to be taken in there. 
1014,"DOCTOR: Yes, you do that. "
1015,(Harris leaves.) 
1016,VICTORIA: Poor man. 
1017,JAMIE: Aye. Hey! I thought we were supposed to be prisoners? 
1018,"DOCTOR: Yes, so did I. We better make the most of it. We've got a lot"
1019,of work to do back at the Tardis. She seems to be sleeping peacefully.
1020,Come on. 
1021,"(The Doctor, Jamie and Victoria leave. Tendrils of seaweed start"
1022,growing down Maggie's arms.)
1023,
1024,[Impeller room]
1025,
1026,"CHIEF: What is it, that sound? "
1027,VAN LUTYENS: It's uncanny. It's like a heartbeat. 
1028,CHIEF: It's stopped again. 
1029,VAN LUTYENS: Well this is surely proof enough. 
1030,ROBSON: Proof? 
1031,VAN LUTYENS: There is something down there blocking the impeller. 
1032,ROBSON: Rubbish! Hysterical nonsense. 
1033,"VAN LUTYENS: But you heard it, that dreadful sound. "
1034,ROBSON: I heard a fault in the base of the impeller. 
1035,VAN LUTYENS: But the impeller isn't working. Don't you believe a thing
1036,until you see it? 
1037,ROBSON: I want that pump operational in half an hour. Now get to it!
1038,
1039,[Tardis laboratory]
1040,
1041,(The Tardis has conveniently washed up on the
1042,beach. The Doctor gets Victoria to test a sample of the weed whilst he
1043,puts the rest in a glass tank.) 
1044,"JAMIE: What are you doing, Doctor? "
1045,"DOCTOR: Well you see, Jamie, these two cylinders contain a small amount"
1046,of natural gas. It should be quite interesting to see what sort of
1047,"effect it has on the weed. How are you doing, Victoria? "
1048,"VICTORIA: I don't know, I think you ought to have a look. "
1049,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, well, that's got the natural iron content. "
1050,"VICTORIA: Well, I did the Bunsen test, like you told me, but I found"
1051,something which worried me. 
1052,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, I'm not surprised. Is this hot? "
1053,"VICTORIA: No, no. "
1054,DOCTOR: You see this rusty stuff here. 
1055,VICTORIA: Yes? 
1056,"DOCTOR: Well, it means that the weed's giving out a gas. Probably"
1057,toxic. 
1058,VICTORIA: Toxic? 
1059,(Jamie is peering into a microscope.) 
1060,"JAMIE: Hey, Doctor! What are these little wriggly things in the weed? "
1061,"DOCTOR: Now just a minute, Jamie. I'm looking at. Little wriggly"
1062,things? Where? 
1063,"JAMIE: Here, look. Look in there. "
1064,"DOCTOR: Jamie, this is it! There's molecular movement! Come and see,"
1065,"Victoria. There. Why, that's amazing! "
1066,JAMIE: What does it mean? 
1067,"VICTORIA: It means, Jamie, that the weed is just as much alive as you"
1068,and me. 
1069, [Refinery corridor]
1070,
1071,"VAN LUTYENS: Mister Harris, I've been trying to get"
1072,hold of you. Mister Robson won't listen to reason. 
1073,"HARRIS: I'm sorry, Van Lutyens, I've got something more important on my"
1074,mind at the moment. 
1075,VAN LUTYENS: Important? What is more important? 
1076,"HARRIS: My wife is ill. Get out of my way, man."
1077,
1078,[Control hall]
1079,
1080,HARRIS: Price! 
1081,"PRICE: Yes, sir? "
1082,HARRIS: Is Doctor Patterson back? 
1083,"PRICE: No, we've heard nothing from D Rig, sir. "
1084,HARRIS: Right. Get on to the Matron at the Medicare Unit and tell her
1085,to send a couple of orderlies over to my quarters with a stretcher to
1086,bring my wife in. She's ill. You know the extension. 
1087,"PRICE: Yes, sir. "
1088,"ROBSON: What's the panic now, Harris? "
1089,"HARRIS: Go on, get on with it. "
1090,"ROBSON: Harris, I asked you a question. "
1091,HARRIS: My wife is ill. She needs medical attention. 
1092,"ROBSON: What's the matter with her, she got a hangover? "
1093,"HARRIS: She's very ill, Mister Robson. "
1094,"ROBSON: Who says so, that Doctor fellow? Incidentally, where is he and"
1095,the two kids? 
1096,"HARRIS: Oh, well, I left them in my quarters when I found my wife was"
1097,ill. 
1098,ROBSON: You what? Those three prisoners were in your charge and you
1099,left them there? 
1100,HARRIS: I was worried about my wife. I didn't have time to think about
1101,it. 
1102,"ROBSON: That's your trouble you never do think, do you, Harris, when"
1103,you should. Those three prisoners were in your charge. 
1104,HARRIS: I don't care. Don't you understand? My wife was lying on the
1105,floor when I got there. She was unconscious and that smell of toxic gas
1106,"was there. She's been poisoned, Robson, poisoned! "
1107,"VAN LUTYENS: And this toxic gas, where does it come from? "
1108,"HARRIS: Oh, I don't know. "
1109,ROBSON: And none of us will know now you've let them loose. 
1110,HARRIS: How could they possibly have anything to do with it? 
1111,ROBSON: That still doesn't alter the fact that you let those prisoners
1112,go without my authority. 
1113,HARRIS: Prisoners? A harmless old man and a couple of teenagers? 
1114,ROBSON: That harmless old man is probably a saboteur. It's probably him
1115,that's been tampering with that release valve on the shoreline.
1116,Creating all those variations in pressure you got so excited about! 
1117,"HARRIS: Oh don't be so ridiculous, Robson. You're clutching at straws,"
1118,stupidly blind to the real facts! 
1119,"ROBSON: Don't shout at me, boy! "
1120,"CHIEF: Mister Robson, sir. Mister Robson. The impeller, it's moving"
1121,again. 
1122,[Impeller room]
1123,
1124,ROBSON: Good man. I told you it was only a
1125,"mechanical fault, didn't I. "
1126,CHIEF: It just started quite suddenly. 
1127,"ROBSON: Keep it going, man. "
1128,CHIEF: I don't know if we can hold it. 
1129,ROBSON: Don't lose it now. 
1130,(The impeller stops again.) 
1131,ROBSON: You fools! You stupid fools! 
1132,"CHIEF: Well, the faults not this end! It must be jammed at the base. "
1133,"ROBSON: You wanted this, didn't you? It's just what you wanted! "
1134,"VAN LUTYENS: You should have listened to me, Robson. "
1135,"ROBSON: What, turned off the flow? Ruined a reputation of thirty years?"
1136,
1137,VAN LUTYENS: Reputation! Don't you realise that what is going on here
1138,is beyond your comprehension? That whatever it is that is in the
1139,"pipelines, that's jamming the impeller, has taken over the rigs, is a"
1140,menace and a threat to us all? 
1141,"ROBSON: The only menace and threat around here is you, Van Lutyens. And"
1142,you Harris. Listen. What are you staring at! I want that impeller
1143,working in half an hour. I'll be in my quarters. Let me know as soon as
1144,the impeller starts moving again. 
1145,(Robson leaves.) 
1146,"VAN LUTYENS: Dwaas. He's cracking up, Harris. "
1147,HARRIS: Look. I've got to get back to my wife. 
1148,"VAN LUTYENS: Harris, you can't go now. He's losing control. "
1149,HARRIS: My wife's been poisoned. 
1150,"VAN LUTYENS: She's in good hands, ja? She'll be brought into the"
1151,Medicare Unit. What can you do? 
1152,HARRIS: But I ought to go and see her. 
1153,"VAN LUTYENS: To hang about and worry, that's all. Robson is cracking"
1154,up. You are the only man with authority to take over. We need you here.
1155,
1156,HARRIS: Chief. 
1157,CHIEF: Sir. 
1158,"HARRIS: Mister Robson, you know him better than any of us. How do you?"
1159,Do you think he's all right? 
1160,"CHIEF: Well, he's under a lot of pressure, I think he's nerves are a"
1161,bit. 
1162,"VAN LUTYENS: Ja, pressure, strain. He's cracking up, I tell you. "
1163,"CHIEF: Well, you're not helping him you know. "
1164,VAN LUTYENS: That's not my job. I am here to give technical advice
1165,"which he ignores. All right, he knows a lot about engineering, but not"
1166,all. And what he does not know is the state of mind of those men out
1167,there on the rigs. 
1168,CHIEF: He ought to know. He was out on those rigs himself long enough. 
1169,"VAN LUTYENS: Oh, ja, ja. He has plenty of professional experience of"
1170,"normal conditions, but these are not normal conditions. There is"
1171,"something very strange going on here, but he refuses to accept the new"
1172,factor. 
1173,CHIEF: So what do you think he should do? 
1174,"VAN LUTYENS: I know what I would do. Close the compound, evacuate the"
1175,rigs. 
1176,CHIEF: He'd never do it. 
1177,VAN LUTYENS: We have lost contact with two rigs. We have a major
1178,"blockage in the main pipeline. The impeller is jammed, and we still"
1179,don't know what is causing the trouble. 
1180,HARRIS: But we regained contact with Baxter on Rig D and he said
1181,everything was under control. 
1182,"VAN LUTYENS: Ja, and we've not heard from him since. And what about Rig"
1183,C? 
1184,"CHIEF: Oh, that could be a telecommunications fault somewhere. "
1185,"VAN LUTYENS: J., it could be, but we have to check that it is and we"
1186,have to check the valve at the base of the impeller. But what does
1187,Robson do? Nothing! Nothing! 
1188,"HARRIS: Well, I suppose he might listen if we all put it to him. What"
1189,"do you think, Chief? "
1190,CHIEF: You're absolutely right of course. We must check.

1193,
1194,(The Doctor shows Victoria a dusty book.) 
1195,"VICTORIA: That's it, Doctor. That's the creature I saw back at the"
1196,Compound. 
1197,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I was afraid it would be. "
1198,VICTORIA: But how did it get in this book? 
1199,"DOCTOR: Well, I told you, Victoria, this is a book of legends and"
1200,superstitions. This particular drawing was supplied by ancient mariners
1201,"in the North Sea in the middle of the eighteenth century, Jamie. "
1202,JAMIE: That's my time. You mean to say this is the creature that
1203,Victoria saw back at the Compound. 
1204,DOCTOR: Yes I think there's no doubt about it. 
1205,"JAMIE: Well, what about these great clumps of weed. "
1206,DOCTOR: Well there's obviously some connection between the weed and the
1207,creatures themselves. 
1208,(Jamie starts to sneeze.) 
1209,"VICTORIA: Oh, no! "
1210,DOCTOR: Gas! 
1211,VICTORIA: What? 
1212,"DOCTOR: Jamie! Jamie, help me get the lid on! Oh, no. Quickly! "
1213,(The seaweed has been growing in the tank and is about to slither out.
1214,Victoria screams. The weed creature falls back in and the Doctor and
1215,Jamie firmly shut the lid.) 
1216,DOCTOR: I was right. The weed formations are feeding off the natural
1217,gas beneath the North Sea and giving off toxic gas. Come on. We must
1218,get back to Harrises' quarters. Come along. Just a minute. That weed
1219,"went back in its tank very suddenly, didn't it? I wonder why? Never"

1225,"Lutyens, isn't it? Isn't it? You've been undermining my authority ever"
1226,since you came here. You and Harris. You've been stirring up trouble
1227,"just to get at me, haven't you? You've even got the Chief on your side"
1228,now. One of my oldest and trusted friends. 
1229,CHIEF: Mister Robson. 
1230,ROBSON: At least I thought I could trust you. 
1231,"CHIEF: Mister Robson, all we want to do is "
1232,ROBSON: I know what you want! I know what you all want! You're going to
1233,"get at me, just so I'll give up. I'm not going to give you that"
1234,"pleasure! Why don't you go and join him? Go on, join Van Lutyens! Go"
1235,"on, join him! What are you standing around for? What are you starring"
1236,at? I'm in charge! I'm in charge here!

1240,Mine! My responsibility! 
1241,(Robson finally leaves.) 
1242,VAN LUTYENS: Do you still think he's capable of running this place? You
1243,do what you like. I'm going to get in touch with my people in the
1244,Hague. 
1245,HARRIS: What can they do? 
1246,VAN LUTYENS: I don't know. They might push your people in London into
1247,"some sort of action. Give me a direct line to Van der Post, Hague"
1248,"Central, "
1249,"PRICE: Yes, sir."

1254,"bunk, exhausted. Outside, Mister Oak comes down the corridor and locks"

1257,(Mister Oak operates the emergency vent controls for the cabin. Robson
1258,becomes aware of a hissing sound and the smell of gas. He sits up to

1277,VICTORIA: Oh no! 
1278,(Jamie sneezes.)

1280,VICTORIA: Where's it coming from? 
1281,"DOCTOR: Jamie, try the kitchen. "
1282,(The Doctor and Victoria go to the bedroom and face a mass of foam
1283,coming towards them. A weed tentacle lashes out. Victoria screams and
1284,it pauses then retreats.) 
1285,VICTORIA: What's it doing? 
1286,(They see that the bed is empty.) 
1287,DOCTOR: We've apparently frightened it away. 
1288,VICTORIA: Mrs Harris? 
1289,"DOCTOR: Mrs Harris. Ah. Oh yes, of course. Mister Harris had her taken"
1290,over to the Medical centre. At least I hope he did.

1292,DOCTOR: That's Jamie! 
1293,VICTORIA: Jamie! 
1294,"JAMIE : Doctor, I'm in here. "

1296,front of him. He slams the door shut again.)

1305,"JAMIE : Quick, Doctor. Hurry. "
1306,(There's an external metal staircase to the roof. The Doctor and
1307,Victoria climb to the kitchen skylight and open it.)

1310,"DOCTOR: Come on, out you come, Jamie. "
1311,"(The foam fills the kitchen as they scramble away, then comes out onto"

1316,
1317,"HARRIS: Yes, it's in here. Look. Well, it was in"
1318,here. I saw it. 
1319,VAN LUTYENS: You did? 
1320,"HARRIS: Yes, it was moving. Something alive. You don't believe me. "
1321,"VAN LUTYENS: Oh yes, I believe you, Mister Harris. It must have come"
1322,"out of the ventilator grille, like it did in the oxygen store. "
1323,HARRIS: You mean when that girl Victoria was locked in. 
1324,"VAN LUTYENS: Ja. And having achieved its purpose, back down the shaft. "
1325,HARRIS: Purpose? What purpose? 
1326,VAN LUTYENS: Who knows? We know so little about it. And no one tries to
1327,find out. 
1328,HARRIS: I know. 
1329,VAN LUTYENS: Least of all Robson. 
1330,"HARRIS: Yes, he rushed out of here as though he were, he was out of his"
1331,mind. 
1332,VAN LUTYENS: You'd better alert security. He may do himself some harm. 
1333,"HARRIS: Yes, you're right. "
1334,[Outside Robson's quarters]
1335,
1336,(Harris locks the door.) 
1337,HARRIS: At least the stuff won't get out of here. 
1338,"VAN LUTYENS: Oh really, Mister Harris. There must be hundreds of grills"
1339,in this compound. And once the foam has got into the shaft it could
1340,emerge from any one of them. 
1341,HARRIS: I suppose you're right. Then we must insist that all emergency
1342,ventilators are kept shut. 
1343,"VAN LUTYENS: Mister Harris, you know what you must do now? "
1344,HARRIS: Do? 
1345,VAN LUTYENS: Assert yourself. Take over the compound.
1346,
1347,[Control hall]
1348,
1349,HARRIS: Price. 
1350,"PRICE: Yes, sir. "
1351,HARRIS: I want you to alert the security posts. Mister Robson may be
1352,ill. I'd like to know his whereabouts. 
1353,"PRICE: Very good, sir. "
1354,HARRIS: And order all areas to keep their emergency air vents closed.
1355,Understand? 
1356,"PRICE: Yes, sir. "
1357,VAN LUTYENS: You're taking over then? 
1358,HARRIS: Robson is still officially in charge. 
1359,VAN LUTYENS: I've already informed my authorities at the Hague. You
1360,must do the same with your Director in London. 
1361,HARRIS: Yes. Price? 
1362,"PRICE: Yes, sir. "
1363,HARRIS: Get me Board Headquarters. I want to speak to Megan Jones.
1364,
1365,[Refinery corridor]
1366,
1367,"DOCTOR: Are you all right, Jamie? "
1368,"JAMIE: Oh, I've come over dizzy. "
1369,"DOCTOR: Well, you just rest a while. "
1370,JAMIE: I'll just get my breath back. 
1371,"VICTORIA: Doctor, why is it that we always land up in trouble? "
1372,"DOCTOR: Well, Victoria, it's the spice of life, my dear. "
1373,"VICTORIA: Oh, well I'm not so sure. I don't really like been scared out"
1374,of my wits every second. 
1375,DOCTOR: Is something wrong? 
1376,"VICTORIA: Well, I just wish that once. Oh, never mind. "
1377,"DOCTOR: Are you right, Jamie? Come on then. "
1378,JAMIE: What's the matter with Victoria?
1379,
1380,[Control hall]
1381,
1382,"PRICE: Thank you, Miss Jones. We'll see you then in"
1383,three hours time. Goodbye. 
1384,HARRIS: In three hours the whole compound will be crawling with board
1385,officials. 
1386,VAN LUTYENS: Let's hope the situation doesn't get any worse. 
1387,HARRIS: I only hope Megan Jones understands why I've taken over. It was
1388,she who insisted that Robson should know this particular complex in the
1389,early days. 
1390,VAN LUTYENS: You did right. I will stand by you. You couldn't let
1391,Robson go on. You had the men on the rigs to think of. They are now her
1392,responsibility. 
1393,HARRIS: If only we knew what we were up against. These creatures that
1394,"have been getting into the refinery, where do they come from? We don't"
1395,even know what they are? 
1396,"DOCTOR: That's where you're wrong, Mister Harris. We do know what they"
1397,are. At least I think we do. Seaweed! 
1398,HARRIS: Seaweed? 
1399,DOCTOR: Yes. Not the sort that you'd normally find on the beach. This
1400,seaweed happens to be dangerously alive. 
1401,HARRIS: Alive? But how can it be? 
1402,DOCTOR: I think you better listen to me. I think you'd all better
1403,listen to me. Large formations of seaweed have been coming up on the
1404,beaches along this coast. Seaweed that shows clear indications of
1405,having life like human beings. 
1406,CHIEF: It's this seaweed that's blocking the pipeline then. 
1407,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think there's no doubt about it. "
1408,VAN LUTYENS: We must clear the base of the impeller. 
1409,"DOCTOR: No, wait. The weed is capable of protecting itself. It gives"
1410,off a toxic gas. It's also a parasite. It attaches itself to other
1411,living things. 
1412,HARRIS: You mean human beings? But what happens to them? 
1413,DOCTOR: I'm afraid I don't know. 
1414,HARRIS: But my wife was stung by the seaweed. 
1415,"DOCTOR: Ah, yes, but she survived, didn't she? How is she? "
1416,HARRIS: Well I asked the Medicare Centre to bring her in. Price? Get
1417,"Medicare for me and ask how my wife is now. Doctor, I've just seen one"
1418,these creature things that your young friend saw in the Oxygen room. 
1419,DOCTOR: Oh? Where? 
1420,HARRIS: In Mister Robson's cabin. It might have attacked him. He was in
1421,a wild state when I went in and just run out. He hasn't been seen
1422,since. 
1423,DOCTOR: Oh dear. 
1424,"PRICE: Mister Harris, sir. "
1425,HARRIS: Yes? 
1426,"PRICE: The Matron says she's sorry, she hasn't brought your wife in yet"
1427,but she's sending someone over now. 
1428,DOCTOR: What? 
1429,"HARRIS: What is it, Doctor? "
1430,"DOCTOR: Well, we've just come from your quarters. Your wife wasn't"
1431,there! 
1432,JAMIE: The place was covered with seaweed. 
1433,HARRIS: Is this right? 
1434,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I'm afraid it is. "
1435,HARRIS: Then where is she? Where is she? I must go and find her. 
1436,(Harris leaves.) 
1437,"VAN LUTYENS: Wait! Well, where do you think she is? Do you think it has"
1438,anything to do with this seaweed stuff? 
1439,DOCTOR: I don't know. I simply don't know.

1443,(Maggie is staring out to sea. Her neck and face
1444,are covered with fronds of weed. Robson comes up and stands next to
1445,her.) 
1446,MAGGIE: There is little time. You know what you must do? 
1447,ROBSON: Yes. 
1448,MAGGIE: You will obey? 
1449,"(Robson nods, then watches Maggie walk into the sea until the waves"
1450,break over her head.)

1456,"in, please. Rig D. Rig D. Control calling. Come in, please. I'm sorry,"
1457,sir. I can't reach them. 
1458,VAN LUTYENS: Try Rig A again. 
1459,"PRICE: Rig A. Control calling Rig A. It's no good, sir. That's three"
1460,"rigs not answering now, sir. "
1461,VAN LUTYENS: The men on the remaining rigs won't last under suspense
1462,much longer. Try the guard post again. See if there's any sign of
1463,Mister Harris. 
1464,PRICE: Very good. 
1465,VAN LUTYENS: Three Rigs now. What can have happened to them? 
1466,"DOCTOR: Well, can't you send someone out to investigate? "
1467,"VAN LUTYENS: No, I'm afraid I have no authority here. I'm just here as"
1468,technical adviser. Mister Harris is in charge. When he comes back he
1469,might possibly authorise the company helicopter for at least to take a
1470,look. 
1471,DOCTOR: We can do nothing. 
1472,VAN LUTYENS: Nothing. Wait. Wait. 
1473,[Impeller room]
1474,
1475,CHIEF: Nothing. Keep checking. 
1476,(A heartbeat sound becomes audible. The tired men become afraid.) 
1477,CHIEF: That's started again.

1481,"VICTORIA: Jamie. Jamie? Jamie, you asleep? "
1482,JAMIE: I'm just resting my eyes. 
1483,VICTORIA: I don't know how you can with all this trouble going on. 
1484,"JAMIE: Oh, don't worry. The Doctor will work something out. He always"
1485,does. 
1486,VICTORIA: Yes. What then? 
1487,"JAMIE: What do you mean, what then? "
1488,VICTORIA: Where will we be next? 
1489,"JAMIE: Oh, Victoria, you know better than to ask a question like that."
1490,We never know where we're going to land one place to the next. It's
1491,"half the fun, isn't it? "
1492,VICTORIA: Is it? 
1493,"JAMIE: Victoria, what's the matter? You've been acting very oddly ever"
1494,since we got here. 
1495,VICTORIA: Oh it's nothing. It doesn't matter. 
1496,JAMIE: Look you'll worry the Doctor if 
1497,"VICTORIA: Jamie, I said it was nothing. Just go back to sleep. "
1498,JAMIE: Aye. Well I wouldn't worry about that old bit of sea weed. The
1499,Doctor'll work something out. 
1500,"VICTORIA: Yes, but will he? There's so many questions. The weed grows."
1501,Feeds off natural gas. But how fast does it grow? What happens to those
1502,"that touch it? Oh, Jamie. Jamie, I'm frightened! "
1503,(The Doctor enters.) 
1504,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sorry, Victoria. Did I startle you? "
1505,VICTORIA: Yes. 
1506,DOCTOR: Where's Jamie? 
1507,VICTORIA: Up there. He's still asleep. Nothing would wake him except a
1508,bomb dropping. 
1509,DOCTOR: Oh good. 
1510,"VICTORIA: Doctor, what's happening? "
1511,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm not sure, Victoria. I'm not sure. Looks so peaceful"
1512,"out there, doesn't it? "
1513,VICTORIA: I heard that noise again. 
1514,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1515,"VICTORIA: Well, what are they doing about it? "
1516,"DOCTOR: Well, we have to wait. "
1517,VICTORIA: Wait? But what for? For one of those awful creatures to come
1518,and attack us all? 
1519,"DOCTOR: Now, Victoria, it's not as bad as all that, you know. "
1520,"VICTORIA: Isn't it? Even you don't know really how bad is it, do you? "
1521,"DOCTOR: Well, no, not exactly. "
1522,VICTORIA: Every time we go anywhere something awful happens. Daleks.
1523,Cybermen. 
1524,DOCTOR: Yeti? 
1525,"VICTORIA: Yes, and Yeti. Why can't we go anywhere pleasant, where"
1526,there's no fighting. Just peace and happiness.

1531,"Robson! Mister Robson! Mister Robson! What are you doing down here,"
1532,sir? Have you seen my wife at all? 
1533,ROBSON: Your wife? 
1534,HARRIS: I've been searching for her. 
1535,"ROBSON: You'll find her, Mister Harris. Very soon. "
1536,HARRIS: Then you haven't seen her? 
1537,(Robson turns and walks off along the beach.)

1540,[Impeller room]
1541,
1542,"DOCTOR: If you don't mind my saying so, Mister Van"
1543,"Lutyens, I think this is a very bad idea of yours. You don't know what"
1544,you're up against. 
1545,"JAMIE: Aye, you wouldn't catch me down there. "
1546,"CHIEF: Why don't we wait until Mister Harris comes back, sir? "
1547,VAN LUTYENS: The only way to find out if this weed stuff of yours is
1548,blocking the base of the impeller is to go down and have a look. 
1549,"CHIEF: Look, Mister Van Lutyens, I have no authority to send my men"
1550,down there. 
1551,VAN LUTYENS: I realise that. That is why I am going down. 
1552,CHIEF: By yourself? 
1553,VAN LUTYENS: Oh yes. 
1554,"CHIEF: I wouldn't go down. Well, I hope you know what you're doing,"
1555,sir. 
1556,VAN LUTYENS: I think so. 
1557,"DOCTOR: I wish you wouldn't do this, Mister Van Lutyens. "
1558,VAN LUTYENS: I can't sit about waiting any longer. I have no position
1559,"of authority here but I do have the run of the company installations,"
1560,and if I can do nothing else I can at least inspect the base of the
1561,impeller shaft. 
1562,(Van Lutyens puts on a gas mask and steps through the airlock onto the
1563,impeller shaft lift platform.)
1564,VAN LUTYENS: Tot straks.
1565,DOCTOR: Good luck. 
1566,"JAMIE: Aye, you'll need it. "
1567,"CHIEF: All right, lower him down. "
1568,(Oak and Quill are at the lift controls.)
1569,
1570,[Impeller shaft]
1571,
1572,"(At the bottom, Van Lutyens switches on his torch"
1573,"and steps out of the lift. He goes to a hatch in the floor, opens it"
1574,and looks down into the pipeline chamber. The heartbeat can be heard in
1575,the pipes. Suddenly Van Lutyens realises that the pipeline is full of
1576,foam and seaweed. It surges up to engulf him and he cries out as the
1577,weed grabs hold and pulls him down into the pipe.)
1578,
1579,[Impeller room]
1580,
1581,CHIEF: Get him up! 
1582,VICTORIA : What is it? What's happened?

1584,VICTORIA: What's happened to him? 
1585,"DOCTOR: Well, we don't know, Victoria. "
1586,(The lift comes up.) 
1587,DOCTOR: What's happened? What did you see? 
1588,CHIEF: He's not in the shaft. He must still be down there. Let's find
1589,Mister Harris. 
1590,DOCTOR: We can't just leave him down there. 
1591,JAMIE: What are we going to do? 
1592,DOCTOR: We're going down there after him. 
1593,"VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor, no. "
1594,"JAMIE: Oh no, we're not. "
1595,"DOCTOR: Jamie, you wouldn't let me go down there on my own, now would"
1596,you? 
1597,"JAMIE: Er, well, no. Oh. "
1598,"VICTORIA: Oh Doctor, you can't. You don't know what's down there. "

1604,"now. Right. Thank you. Ah, Mister Harris. Mister Harris, we've been"
1605,looking for you everywhere. 
1606,"HARRIS: What is it, Price? "
1607,"PRICE: Are you all right, sir? "
1608,HARRIS: Yes. Just tired. Is there any news of my wife? 
1609,"PRICE: No, I'm afraid not, sir. You didn't find her? Oh, Mister Harris?"
1610,
1611,HARRIS: Yes? 
1612,"PRICE: The director, Miss Megan Jones, is leaving reception on her way"
1613,"here now, sir. "

1615,"PRICE: In the Impeller area I think, sir. "
1616,HARRIS: All right.
1617,
1618,[Impeller room]
1619,
1620,CHIEF: This is terrible. Do you mean to say they
1621,both went down inside that shaft? 
1622,VICTORIA: I couldn't stop them. They went to look for Mister Van
1623,Lutyens. 
1624,HARRIS: What? What has happened to him? 
1625,(Oak and Quill are still at the lift controls as Harris enters.) 
1626,"CHIEF: Mister Harris, thank goodness you're back. Mister Van Lutyens"
1627,went down inside the impeller shaft to try and find what was blocking
1628,the pipe line. 
1629,HARRIS: Yes? 
1630,CHIEF: He didn't come back. Now the Doctor and the boy has gone down
1631,there. 
1632,HARRIS: They've done what? Get them up at once. Stop the lift. 
1633,"OAK: I'm sorry, sir. It's too late. "
1634,[Impeller shaft]
1635,
1636,(The Doctor and Jamie are both wearing gas masks.) 
1637,"JAMIE: Gloomy sort of place, isn't it? "
1638,"DOCTOR: Jamie, that hole goes straight down to the big gasometer down"
1639,below. 
1640,"JAMIE: Hey, isn't that Van Lutyens' torch? "
1641,"DOCTOR: Well, it must be. "
1642,JAMIE: But where is he? 
1643,"DOCTOR: Shine it down there, Jamie. "
1644,(The torch doesn't work.) 
1645,DOCTOR: Give it to me. 
1646,"JAMIE: Come on, Doctor. Let's get out of here. You can feel there's"
1647,something evil lurking down here. 
1648,[Refinery corridor]
1649,
1650,"PERKINS: It all seems quiet enough, Miss Jones. "
1651,JONES: Of course it is. Robson's an efficient man. Why do you think I
1652,gave him control of the compound? He knows the job backwards. 
1653,PERKINS: Then why the sudden panic? 
1654,JONES: I don't know. Harris was rather vague. 
1655,PERKINS: Vague? He said he was taking over from Robson. I wouldn't call
1656,that vague. 
1657,"JONES: You've never met Robson, have you Perkins? "
1658,PERKINS: No. But I've 
1659,"JONES: When you do, you'll realise he's not the sort of man one pushes"
1660,around. 
1661,PERKINS: Then what's it all about? 
1662,"JONES: Just an internal squabble, I'd say. Harris is a bright man. I"
1663,sent him thinking he might gain from Robson's practical experience.
1664,Obviously the two haven't hit it off together. 
1665,PERKINS: So we're pouring oil. Politics? 
1666,"JONES: Let's go and see, shall we?"
1667,
1668,[Impeller room]
1669,
1670,"VICTORIA: Jamie! Doctor! Oh, I do wish they'd"
1671,hurry. 
1672,"HARRIS: Is there any way we can get them up, Chief? "
1673,"CHIEF: Well, we can't use the lift in case they want to get back in a"
1674,hurry. There is the ladder inside the pipe line. 
1675,PRICE: Mister Harris? 
1676,"HARRIS: Yes, what is it, Price? "
1677,"PRICE: Miss Megan Jones has arrived, sir. "
1678,"HARRIS: Oh, I see. Thank you. Chief, you'd better come with me. I'm"
1679,going to need some support when I talk to Megan Jones. 
1680,CHIEF: All right. 
1681,VICTORIA: But what about Jamie and the Doctor? 
1682,"HARRIS: There's isn't a great deal we can do at the moment, I'm afraid."
1683,"Oak, as soon as they signal, bring them up. And if there's any sign of"
1684,"trouble, come and get me. "
1685,OAK: You can rely on us. 
1686,"HARRIS: Come on, Chief. "
1687,"VICTORIA: Will they be all right. I mean, is it safe? "
1688,"OAK: Oh yes, Miss. Don't you worry about a thing. We'll take care of"

1690,
1691,[Control hall]

1693,JONES: Creatures? Seaweed creatures? What do you
1694,"say to that, Perkins? "
1695,"PERKINS: Oh, well "
1696,HARRIS: It's true. 
1697,"JONES: You can't be serious, Mister Harris. "
1698,"HARRIS: These creatures have been seen in the refinery itself, in the"
1699,oxygen room 
1700,JONES: By some half-witted Doctor and a couple of teenagers. 
1701,HARRIS: And by me. 
1702,JONES: You've seen them? 
1703,"HARRIS: Yes, Miss Jones. I have seen them. "
1704,"JONES: Harris, I understand your wife had some sort of accident. I know"
1705,this must have been a considerable shock to you and I fully understand 
1706,"HARRIS: You think I'm lying, that I've been seeing things? Believe me,"
1707,there are things you don't know. 
1708,JONES: I know throughout the southern region receiving stations are
1709,working on emergency supplies. What are we going to do about it? 
1710,HARRIS: At present there's nothing we can do about it. One by one we're
1711,losing contact with the rigs out at sea. 
1712,JONES: Then I suggest you send someone out there to see what's going
1713,on. 
1714,HARRIS: All right. Have I your permission to call out Air Defence. 
1715,JONES: Certainly not. This not is a national emergency. Use the company
1716,helicopters. 
1717,HARRIS: But you don't understand what's going on. 
1718,JONES: Will you please do as I say. 
1719,HARRIS: Price? 
1720,"PRICE: Yes, sir. "
1721,"HARRIS: Get me the helicopter hangar, please. "
1722,"PRICE: Very good, sir. "
1723,"JONES: Now, Mister Harris, I think I'll have a talk with Chief Robson. "
1724,"HARRIS: Oh, I'm sorry, I think. Well, he's not very well. "
1725,JONES: Not well? In what way? 
1726,HARRIS: Something's happened to him. That's all I can tell you. 
1727,"JONES: Well, what? What's happened? "

1746,on those rigs there must be a reply.

1782,here.

1794,HARRIS: Save the lives of the men on all the other rigs. 
1795,JONES: How? 
1796,HARRIS: Give me permission to evacuate them.

1800,"PERKINS: You must be out of your mind. Miss Jones, you can't really"
1801,agree to such a thing. 
1802,HARRIS: We have to. The men's lives are more important than any of
1803,those rigs. 
1804,PERKINS: The Minister would never agree. 
1805,"JONES: That'll do, Perkins. You ask me to destroy years of hard work,"
1806,skill and government money like that? 
1807,HARRIS: I'm asking you to destroy this evil that's in the sea before
1808,it's too late. Bomb the rigs. I implore you. 
1809,ROBSON: No! No! Never! You leave those rigs alone. They're mine.

1813,I built them. My own flesh and blood. They're mine. They're my life!

1827,
1828,DOCTOR: I'm afraid not. 
1829,HARRIS: Have you any idea what happened? 
1830,DOCTOR: Yes. Jamie and I nearly joined him. The whole of the bottom of
1831,the impeller shaft is covered in weed and foam. 
1832,JONES: What happened to Mister Van Lutyens? And Mister Robson? 
1833,DOCTOR: I'm afraid that Mister Robson is being controlled by some force
1834,that emanates from this weed. 
1835,JONES: That's incredible. 
1836,HARRIS: That's what we've said so far about everything the Doctor has
1837,told us. Each time he's been proved right. I think it's about time we

1959,JONES: No! 
1960,"DOCTOR: No, we daren't do that . "
1961,HARRIS: Why not? 
1962,"DOCTOR: Well, that would spread this menace over a wide area and make"
1963,it impossible to attack it. 
1964,"HARRIS: Well, what are we going to do? "
1965,"DOCTOR: No, what is the weed going to do? "
1966,JONES: What can it do? 
1967,"DOCTOR: Well, let's think. Now I imagine that in the first place the"
1968,weed was drawn up by one of the drilling rigs. 
1969,"HARRIS: No, no. Anything that comes up through the bores would be"
1970,cleared by the engineers at the source otherwise it would block the
1971,pumps. 
1972,DOCTOR: Precisely. And the engineers who cleared it must have touched
1973,"it, yes? "
1974,"HARRIS: Yes, so they must have been amongst the first to be controlled."
1975,
1976,"DOCTOR: And since then, this attack, and it is an attack, has followed"

1990,"HARRIS: Doctor, there's one thing that doesn't fit in with your theory."

1993,HARRIS: When Victoria was locked in the Oxygen room. Now she's nothing
1994,to do with the personnel here. 
1995,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's something that's been puzzling me too. But she"
1996,disturbed somebody who was interfering with the oxygen supplies. 
1997,HARRIS: Someone wearing a gas mask. 
1998,"DOCTOR: Now supposing that person was under the control of the weed, he"
1999,was wearing a gas mask for one reason only. 
2000,HARRIS: Because to him pure oxygen would be toxic? 
2001,"DOCTOR: Exactly, Mister Harris. "
2002,"HARRIS: Well then, we can use the oxygen as a weapon against the weed. "
2003,"DOCTOR: Well, it's only a theory at the moment. "

2029,fit state to help us in any way. 
2030,"JONES: I fully realise that, Mister Harris, but we're old friends. He"
2031,might talk to me. There's just a possibility that he may know something
2032,that could help us.

2054,no guarantee it will end this nightmare. It might well spread the

2130,HARRIS: Here? 
2131,PERKINS: But why? 
2132,DOCTOR: Because this is the gas distribution centre. It'll want to gain

2185,then punches Quill before he can get out of reach. Victoria screams.
2186,Quill drops to the floor.) 
2187,"JAMIE: That soon put paid to him, didn't it. Didn't know what hit him,"
2188,did he. 
2189,"DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, I'm sure you're right. "
2190,JAMIE: There's a wee bit of power left in the old McCrimmon punch yet. 
2191,"DOCTOR: I'm sorry to disillusion you, Jamie, but I don't think it was"
2192,the punch that did it. 
2193,CHIEF: Mister Harris! 
2194,HARRIS: What is it? 
2195,"CHIEF: I think you better come, sir. Quickly! "

2198,(There is a mass of weed and foam on the monitor.) 
2199,JONES: What's the trouble? 
2200,HARRIS: The pipeline room. 
2201,JONES: But it's incredible. 
2202,PERKINS: Why can't we do something? 
2203,JONES: We'll have to trust this strange Doctor. He's the only one who
2204,seems to be able to anticipate events. 
2205,PERKINS: Don't you think that in itself is suspect? 
2206,JONES: He's our only hope. Come on.

2212,"JAMIE: What's happened to it, Doctor? "
2213,"DOCTOR: It's beginning to expand, like it did in the Tardis. "
2214,JAMIE: Is there no way of stopping it? 
2215,DOCTOR: No. I should have thought of this. 
2216,"JONES: What, do you mean this horrible stuff's growing all the time? "
2217,DOCTOR: I'm very much afraid so! 
2218,"PRICE : Mister Harris, sir. Mister Harris. Mister Robson's broken"
2219,out of his cabin. He's attacked the guard!

2233,JAMIE: I thought she was with you!

2243,"JAMIE: They're closed, too. "

2317,JONES: But we need you here. You're our only hope.

2411,come to. The third door is at the end of this corridor.)

2440,VICTORIA : Hurry.

2442,obsolete. Only our new masters can offer us life. 
2443,DOCTOR: Matter will never conquer mind. It's against the law of nature!

2454,screams.)

2456,(She does. Robson stops and clutches his head in pain.) 
2457,ROBSON: No! No! No! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! 
2458,(Robson goes back into the cabin and sinks down into the foam.) 
2459,DOCTOR: Come along. It's time we got out of here. 
2460,VICTORIA: What about the door? 
2461,"JAMIE: Yes, should we lock him in? "
2462,"DOCTOR: No, no. I think it's all right now. The helicopter's waiting."

2468,hatch and go to the heli-pad.)

2470,VICTORIA: I can't see anything except this awful foam. 
2471,"JAMIE: Don't worry, Victoria, it won't hurt you. "
2472,DOCTOR: There it is! 
2473,ALL: Hey! Hey! Hey! 
2474,"VICTORIA: Oh, can't he see us? "
2475,DOCTOR: Probably not. 
2476,JAMIE: He's probably just too scared. 
2477,"DOCTOR: Oh Jamie, help me get this hatchway covered. We can't hang"
2478,around here. The helicopter will never see us. 
2479,JAMIE: But we'll never get of the rig without it. 
2480,DOCTOR: There's Robson's helicopter in there. 
2481,JAMIE: But it hasn't got a driver. 
2482,DOCTOR: I've been dying to get my hands on one of those things. Come
2483,on. Come on.
2484,
2485, [Helicopter]
2486,
2487,(The Doctor starts up the engine and it begins to
2488,take off as the foam tries to smother the machine.) 
2489,"VICTORIA: Oh the foam, Doctor! I can't see! "
2490,"DOCTOR: Don't worry, Victoria. We'll soon be out of it. "
2491,JAMIE: I hope you know what you're doing. 
2492,"DOCTOR: Well, we're airborne, aren't we, Jamie? Anyway, Astrid Ferrier."
2493,We watched her fly one of these things. 
2494,VICTORIA: That's the only time. 
2495,"DOCTOR: Now, don't worry, Victoria. It's a very primitive machine, you"
2496,know. It should be easy to control. 
2497,"VICTORIA: Doctor, look out! "
2498,"(But flying in three dimensions is not that easy, and the helicopter"
2499,"weaves around, making near-misses of the rig. Oh's and gasps of fear"
2500,from Victoria and Jamie.) 
2501,"DOCTOR: Well, that's strange. "
2502,JAMIE: What? 
2503,"DOCTOR: Well, I was always under the impression that you couldn't loop"
2504,the loop in a helicopter. 
2505,JAMIE: What? 
2506,VICTORIA: Look out! 
2507,"(They suddenly loose height, heading back to the rig. The Doctor"
2508,narrowly avoids a crash.) 
2509,PILOT : Stick back. Stick back. Nose down a bit. Go on. Right pedal
2510,down. Right rudder. 
2511,(It's the pilot of the other helicopter to the rescue.) 
2512,DOCTOR: Right rudder. 
2513,"PILOT : Not too much, not too much. Try and keep the nose on the"
2514,horizon. That's better. Okay. Okay. Now too much. Stick back! Stick
2515,"back! Stick back, you want to come up now. Come on, you're getting too"
2516,near the water. Much too near the water. Stick back. Stick back. That's
2517,better. Pull her up! Stick back! Stick back quickly! To the right.
2518,You're about to hit the water. That's right. Now try and keep
2519,"everything centralised. Okay, now pull her up. Stick back! Stick back!"
2520,"Quickly, stick back, stick back! Now try and keep the control central. "
2521,(The Doctor finally gets his helicopter under a semblance of control.) 
2522,"DOCTOR: Yes, thank you so much. Oh, just one thing. I've got it up all"
2523,right and it should be comparatively simple to propel it forward.
2524,"However, how do I land it?"
2525,
2526, [Control hall]
2527,
2528,HARRIS: It's no good. We won't hear from the Doctor
2529,or any of them. We must evacuate the compound. 
2530,JONES: No! We said an hour. He's got ten more minutes. 
2531,"HARRIS: But even if he does come back, what good could he do? The only"
2532,possible weapon we might have used against the weed has been destroyed.
2533,
2534,"JONES: That was your entire stock of oxygen, was it? "
2535,HARRIS: Yes. 
2536,"JONES: Right. Perkins, get onto London to the Defence Minister. I want"
2537,a full red alert on this now. Tell him what's happened and ask him to
2538,arrange for as many tankers of oxygen as he can muster to be sent here
2539,immediately. 
2540,"PERKINS: Yes, Miss Jones. "
2541,HARRIS: They won't be in time. We must evacuate the compound. The
2542,pipeline room is a mass of weed and foam. You've seen how rapidly it
2543,reproduces. It could swamp the entire compound at any moment. 
2544,"JONES: It could, but it hasn't yet, and until it does, we stay here. "
2545,"HARRIS: And when it does attack, how do you expect to fight it? With"
2546,what weapons? 
2547,"DOCTOR: Perhaps I can answer those questions, Mister Harris. "
2548,"JONES: Doctor! Oh, thank heavens you're alive. "
2549,HARRIS: What about Robson? Did you find him? 
2550,"JAMIE: Aye, we found him all right. "
2551,HARRIS: And my wife? 
2552,"DOCTOR: Well, we didn't see her, no. "
2553,"HARRIS: No. There's not much hope, is there. What can we do? How can we"
2554,fight this hideous thing? 
2555,DOCTOR: You say there's not much hope. I believe there is. 
2556,"HARRIS: But even if we succeed in fighting of the weed, what about"
2557,those people already affected by it? 
2558,DOCTOR: Well on our way back here we stopped of at the Medicare Centre.
2559,The man that Jamie fought with in the corridor has almost completely
2560,recovered. 
2561,HARRIS: What? 
2562,"DOCTOR: Yes, the weed growth on his arm has disappeared and died. He's"
2563,"bemused, he's dazed, but he's alive! "
2564,HARRIS: But how? Why? What killed the weed? 
2565,DOCTOR: Noise! Sound vibrations. 
2566,JONES: How did you find out? 
2567,DOCTOR: Victoria discovered it. 
2568,VICTORIA: I did? 
2569,"DOCTOR: Well, yes. You screamed. "
2570,VICTORIA: I screamed. 
2571,"DOCTOR: It's her scream, her particular pattern of sound that does the"
2572,trick. 
2573,HARRIS: So that's why the crews on the rigs spoke softly. The noise
2574,affected them. 
2575,"DOCTOR: Yes, very possibly. Now, before you evacuate this compound,"
2576,just give me one half hour. 
2577,HARRIS: The risk is too great. The entire compound is alive with
2578,seaweed. 
2579,"JONES: Half an hour won't make that much difference. Doctor, what do"
2580,you think we can do? 
2581,"DOCTOR: We make a noise, Miss Jones. We make an awful lot of noise! "
2582,HARRIS: It's too late. We'll never stop it now. 
2583,DOCTOR: But we've got to. It may be too late. 
2584,"HARRIS: It's impossible, I tell you. It's seeping in from every corner"
2585,of the compound. 
2586,"DOCTOR: Yes, but if we can destroy the weed's nerve centre. "
2587,JONES: But you said yourself you don't know where the nerve centre is. 
2588,DOCTOR: But we do. It's here. 
2589,HARRIS: That's the Control Rig. 
2590,DOCTOR: Precisely. We must generate enough sound to penetrate the
2591,Control Rig. 
2592,JONES: But how will you get it there? 
2593,"DOCTOR: That way. Through the pipelines. Mister Harris, this is the"
2594,only way to help your wife and all those other people. 
2595,"HARRIS: Yes, I realise that, but there isn't time. "
2596,DOCTOR: Please. Just one half hour. 
2597,HARRIS: Price. 
2598,PRICE: Sir. 
2599,HARRIS: What's happening in the pipeline room? 
2600,(A monitor is switched on.) 
2601,"VICTORIA: Oh, no. "
2602,PRICE: Half an hour? 
2603,"HARRIS: Yes, that's about all we've got. But you're right. We must try."
2604,
2605,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. Now then, Mister Price, where do all these big"
2606,leads go to? 
2607,"PRICE: The transmitter and loud speakers down below, sir. "
2608,DOCTOR: I see. 
2609,"PRICE: What's this all about, Doctor? "
2610,"DOCTOR: Well, if we can boost this equipment to transmit enough sound"
2611,"down the pipeline, we can destroy the weed's nerve centre. "
2612,JONES: But do you think this idea will work? 
2613,DOCTOR: Have you got a tape recorder or some such thing? 
2614,"PRICE: Yes, sir. "
2615,"DOCTOR: Victoria, I want you to scream. "
2616,VICTORIA: Scream? 
2617,DOCTOR: He will record it. Make a loop of it so that we can repeat it
2618,endlessly. 
2619,"PRICE: Right, sir. What have we got here? "
2620,JONES: I hope he knows what he's doing. 
2621,JAMIE: Of course he does. I think. 
2622,"CHIEF: Mister Harris, the impeller shaft. You men, quick! "
2623,"JONES: Oh come on, Doctor."
2624,
2625,[Impeller room]
2626,
2627,"CHIEF: Look, there! "
2628,(The weed and foam smashes through the doors and into the airlock.)
2629,
2630, [Control hall]
2631,
2632,DOCTOR: Take these magnetised speakers and attach
2633,"them to the pipeline over there. Jamie, give me a hand. "
2634,"PRICE: Right, ready miss? Now scream into this. Now. "
2635,"VICTORIA: What, now? "
2636,"PRICE: Yes, yes. There's not a moment to lose. "
2637,VICTORIA: I can't. It's silly. 
2638,"PRICE: No, no. Please, please, you have to. "
2639,"VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor! "
2640,"DOCTOR: What's the matter, Victoria? "
2641,"PRICE: She can't scream, sir. "
2642,"DOCTOR: Oh no! Oh Victoria, that's ridiculous. "
2643,"VICTORIA: Jamie, you can't scream just like that! "
2644,DOCTOR: Everything depends upon you screaming. 
2645,(Victoria screams.) 
2646,DOCTOR: There you are. I knew you could. 
2647,(Victoria screams again as she looks over the Doctor's shoulder to see
2648,the foam burst out of the impeller room airlock and start to flood the
2649,room.) 
2650,HARRIS: Run! Don't just stand there! 
2651,DOCTOR: Keep away from it! Keep away! 
2652,CHIEF: Shut those doors! 
2653,"HARRIS: Quick, this way."
2654,(The Chief and Harris come back into the control hall and jam the
2655,impeller room door closed. The trapped technicians fall victim to the
2656,foam and weed.) 
2657,HARRIS: All release valves open! Quick! 
2658,"JONES: What are you doing, man? "
2659,"HARRIS: I'm going to save the lives of an awful lot of people, Miss"
2660,"Jones. Close feed lines one to six! Come on, man! "
2661,JONES: You mean you're giving up? You're evacuating? 
2662,"HARRIS: Open your eyes, Miss Jones. Can't you see what's happening?"
2663,We're gradually being strangled. I can't risk the lives of these men
2664,here any longer. 
2665,"DOCTOR: Just a few more minutes, please, Mister Harris. The scream's"
2666,ready. 
2667,HARRIS: Good! 
2668,DOCTOR: And Mister Harris. 
2669,"HARRIS: All right, all right, what do you want us to do? "
2670,"DOCTOR: Now then, I've attached the speakers to the pipeline."
2671,Victoria's scream will be put through this. 
2672,HARRIS: What does that do? 
2673,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a little toy of my own. Together with the"
2674,"amplifiers, yes, it should produce a sonic laser sound wave. "
2675,JONES: You mean like a laser light beam? 
2676,"DOCTOR: Yes, passing through the pipes. It'll destroy the nerve centre"
2677,of the weed. 
2678,"HARRIS: Yes, but will it destroy the weed here? "
2679,"DOCTOR: Well unfortunately no. No, we have to do battle with that"
2680,ourselves. 
2681,HARRIS: How? 
2682,"DOCTOR: With these, Mister Price. "
2683,PRICE: With what? 
2684,"DOCTOR: If the weed attacks us here, we simply point these at it and"
2685,"hope for the best. Now, for heaven's sake, don't get in the way of the"
2686,speakers. The sound'll cut you to pieces. HARRIS: Look there! 
2687,DOCTOR: Give me the other two. Let's set up another two. 
2688,PRICE: What's the current? 
2689,"DOCTOR: Come along, no time to waste. "
2690,"HARRIS: Chief! Chief, quick! "
2691,DOCTOR: Here we are. That's it. 
2692,"JAMIE: Doctor, how many is there? I thought that there was only the one"
2693,monster.
2694,
2695, [Outside the Control hall]
2696,
2697,(The Chief and Harris are confronted by a mass of
2698,weed creature.) 
2699,"HARRIS: Back, Chief. Back. "
2700, [Control hall]
2701,
2702,HARRIS: Full Alert! Close all doors! 
2703,DOCTOR: There we are. 
2704,HARRIS: Close all doors! 
2705,JAMIE: Those doors won't hold! 
2706,"DOCTOR: Take this and point it at the monster, but don't get in the way"
2707,of it. 
2708,HARRIS: Look out! 
2709,(The doors bulge under the weight of the weed creature. Then suddenly
2710,they give way. The weed creature is in the doorway.) 
2711,"DOCTOR: Back, everybody. Onto the platform here. "
2712,"(Everyone gets onto the raised control platform except Price, who is"
2713,frozen with fear.) 
2714,"DOCTOR: Switch it on, man, switch it on! Hold that, Jamie. Which is the"
2715,connector switch? The connector switch! 
2716,(He passes his own portable speaker to JAMIE and goes over (The Doctor
2717,shakes Price and he hits the switch.) 
2718,DOCTOR: Come on. Switch on your speaker and point it at the creature.
2719,Switch on! Go on!
2720,(Victoria's electronic scream rings out but the foam comes closer.)
2721,JAMIE: What's going on?
2722,JONES: It's not working!
2723,DOCTOR: Give it a minute.
2724,"JONES: It's not working, I tell you. "
2725,(The weed creature falters.) 
2726,HARRIS: No! Look! 
2727,"(The foam begins to retreat and the creature goes back to the doorway,"
2728,writhing.) 
2729,DOCTOR: Behind you! Look behind you! The corridor! 
2730,(The monitor shows the corridor clearing as the foam and weed ebbs
2731,away. Soon it is almost totally clear.) 
2732,JAMIE: It worked. 
2733,"HARRIS: Doctor, it worked. "
2734,DOCTOR: Switch off. Price! Switch off now. 
2735,(Blissful silence.) 
2736,"PRICE: Doctor, you've done it. "
2737,"DOCTOR: Mister Price, I think you can switch it all off now. "
2738,PRICE: What about the weed's nerve centre at the Control Rig? 
2739,DOCTOR: What about 
2740,PRICE: Do you think we've destroyed that? 
2741,"DOCTOR: Why don't you go and see, Mister Price. "
2742,PRICE: Right. 
2743,HARRIS: Price. 
2744,"PRICE: Yes, sir. "
2745,HARRIS: Send out the company helicopters right away to the Control Rig.
2746,I want a full report right away. 
2747,"PRICE: Very good, sir. "
2748,"JONES: Well Doctor, I don't quite know what to say, except thank you. "
2749,"DOCTOR: Miss Jones, that will be more than sufficient. "
2750,HARRIS: I still can't believe it. 
2751,"DOCTOR: What's the matter, eh? "
2752,VICTORIA: I don't know. I'm always frightened. 
2753,"DOCTOR: Well, of course. "
2754,"VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor, I can't. "
2755,DOCTOR: It's all right. 
2756,VICTORIA: I can't. 
2757,"HARRIS: Doctor, they're safe! "
2758,"DOCTOR: It's all right, they're safe. "
2759,VICTORIA: I can't. 
2760,"DOCTOR: They're safe. Listen, they're safe. Come along and see. "
2761,HARRIS: They're all safe! We've won! Isn't it marvellous? Maggie!
2762,"Maggie! Mister Robson, can you hear me? "
2763,"ROBSON : Yes, Mister Harris, we can. "
2764,"MAGGIE : Yes, darling, we can hear you. "
2765,"HARRIS: Good, good. Are you all well? Has the weed gone? "
2766,"ROBSON : The weed? Oh yes, yes, it's gone. "
2767,HARRIS: What about Van Lutyens? I don't suppose you 
2768,"ROBSON : No, he's fine. He's well. "
2769,"MAGGIE : Darling, we're all all right, I promise you. "
2770,"HARRIS: Quiet, everybody, quiet! Mister Robson, we're sending out one"
2771,of the company helicopters to you right away. You'll be back with us in
2772,less than an hour.
2773,
2774,[Harrises' quarters]
2775,
2776,(On the patio that evening.) 
2777,"ROBSON: Oh, I should have listened to you in the first place, Mister"
2778,Harris. 
2779,"HARRIS: Oh, I doubt it would have helped. As it turned out, we were"
2780,lucky we didn't tamper with the weed. 
2781,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. "
2782,"MAGGIE: We'll the next time you ask me to get something from your desk,"
2783,you can do it yourself. 
2784,"ROBSON: To think I wanted to keep you locked up, Doctor. "
2785,"DOCTOR: Well, lots of people have tried. "
2786,HARRIS: They didn't want to. 
2787,"ROBSON: That was a very splendid dinner, Mrs Harris. Now if you'll"
2788,"excuse me, I'm very tired. "
2789,"DOCTOR: Oh, really. Oh, dear. There we are. "
2790,"ROBSON: See you in the morning, Doctor? "
2791,"DOCTOR: Well, no. No, as a matter of fact, we must be on our way. "
2792,"ROBSON: Oh, dear. Where are you going? "
2793,"DOCTOR: Well, we haven't quiet decided yet. "
2794,"JAMIE: Aye, even if we had it wouldn't make any difference. We wouldn't"
2795,get there. Not with him. 
2796,"ROBSON: If you're ever around here again, do drop in. And in the front"
2797,"gate this time, just to avoid any unfortunate incidents. "
2798,"DOCTOR: Yes, I will. "
2799,"HARRIS: Good night, Mister Robson. "
2800,"ROBSON: Good night. Bye, Mrs Harris. "
2801,"DOCTOR: Goodbye, Mister Robson. Well, I suppose I think it's time we"
2802,went. Jamie. Victoria. 
2803,"JAMIE: Hey, Victoria. Wakey, wakey. What's the matter? "
2804,"DOCTOR: You don't want to come with us, do you, Victoria. "
2805,VICTORIA: I don't know. I don't really want to leave you. 
2806,"DOCTOR: Well, I suspected as much. "
2807,VICTORIA: Would you mind? 
2808,"JAMIE: Victoria, you can't "
2809,"DOCTOR: Just a minute, Jamie. You mean you want to stay here and settle"
2810,"down. Well, if you want to, you must. "
2811,VICTORIA: I'm sorry. 
2812,"DOCTOR: No, that's all right. Mrs Harris, I wonder if you'd mind if"
2813,"Victoria stayed with you for a little while. You see, she's got no"
2814,parents or home and it is a bit difficult 
2815,"MAGGIE: Well, of course. We'd be delighted to have you for as long as"
2816,you want to stay. 
2817,"VICTORIA: Oh, would you? "
2818,MAGGIE: Yes. 
2819,"DOCTOR: There, thank you very much. Jamie and I will stay for another"
2820,"day, just in case you want to think again. "
2821,"JAMIE: Look, we'll talk it over later. "
2822,"DOCTOR: Now, Jamie. She must make up her own mind. It's her own life."
2823,It's her decision. 
2824,JAMIE: Aye.
2825,
2826, [Control hall]
2827,
2828,"PRICE: Thank you, Rig D. Normal function on all"
2829,channels. Control checks positive. Closing down now. All communications
2830,remain on standby. 
2831,"ROBSON: All right, Price? "
2832,"PRICE: Oh yes, thank you, sir. Back to normal. "
2833,ROBSON: Relief? 
2834,"PRICE: Crews on their way, sir. "
2835,ROBSON: Bet you could do with a bit of shut-eye. 
2836,"PRICE: Oh, I don't know. I think I'm a bit past it. "
2837,"ROBSON: Go out like a light, eh? "
2838,PRICE: Probably. 
2839,ROBSON: Chief still here? 
2840,"PRICE: Yes, in the impeller room, sir. "
2841,"ROBSON: Goodnight, Price. "
2842,"PRICE: Goodnight, sir."
2843,
2844, [Impeller room]
2845,
2846,"ROBSON: Hello, Chief. "
2847,CHIEF: Mister Robson. 
2848,"ROBSON: Sound as a bell, eh? "
2849,"CHIEF: Almost, sir. "
2850,ROBSON: Almost? 
2851,CHIEF: Still half a point off capacity. 
2852,ROBSON: Is it? 
2853,CHIEF: The main control valve was slightly damaged. They're working on
2854,it now. Be up to our normal output in the morning. There's still one or
2855,two minor repairs to be done. 
2856,"ROBSON: Not tonight, Chief. "
2857,"CHIEF: Well, why not? "
2858,ROBSON: Get some sleep. Don't argue. Leave it to the relief. 
2859,CHIEF: All right. 
2860,ROBSON: Where do you lot think you're going? There's another three
2861,minutes before your relief arrives. 
2862,"CHIEF: Nice to know you're back to normal, sir. "
2863,"ROBSON: If I didn't know you better, Chief, I would swear you were"
2864,giving me lip. 
2865,"CHIEF: Oh, I wouldn't dream of doing that, sir. "
2866,"ROBSON: Wouldn't you? Goodnight, Chief. "
2867,"CHIEF: Goodnight, sir."
2868,
2869, [Harrises' quarters]
2870,
2871,JAMIE: Are you not tired? 
2872,"VICTORIA: No. No, I'm fine. I'm not tired at all. "
2873,JAMIE: Do you know what the Doctor's just gone and done? 
2874,VICTORIA: No. 
2875,JAMIE: He's only gone down the beach for a swim. He gets worse. You're
2876,"still not sure, are you? "
2877,VICTORIA: Yes. But it doesn't make it any easier leaving you and the
2878,Doctor. 
2879,"JAMIE: Aye, we've been together a long time now. Has the Doctor said"
2880,anything to you? 
2881,"VICTORIA: No. No, you know what he's like, he wouldn't. He believes in"
2882,people making up their own minds. 
2883,"JAMIE: Oh, Victoria. Do you think you'll be happy here? "
2884,"VICTORIA: Oh, I think so. The Harrises are very nice people. "
2885,"JAMIE: Yes, I know that, but they're not from your time, are they? "
2886,VICTORIA: I wouldn't be at ease back in Victorian times. I had no
2887,parents or family left there anyway. 
2888,"JAMIE: Aye, that's true. Oh, well. "
2889,VICTORIA: Jamie. 
2890,JAMIE: Yes? 
2891,"VICTORIA: You wouldn't go without saying goodbye, would you? "
2892,"JAMIE: Of course not. That won't be till the morning anyway. Goodnight,"
2893,Victoria. 
2894,"VICTORIA: Goodnight, Jamie. "
2895,(They hug and kiss.)

2897,[Beach]
2898,
2899,"(The next morning, Victoria and the Harrises say"
2900,farewell to the Doctor and Jamie. The Tardis is floating offshore again
2901,so the Doctor and Jamie have to use the rubber dinghy to get to it.
2902,"Jamie waves. Victoria waves back, crying, and Maggie hugs her.)"
2903,
2904,[Tardis]
2905,
2906,(They can see Victoria on the scanner.) 
2907,JAMIE: We can't just leave her. 
2908,"DOCTOR: We are not leaving her, Jamie. It was her decision to stay."
2909,"She'll be quite all right with the Harrises. Now don't worry so much,"
2910,Jamie. 
2911,"JAMIE: I'm not, I'm just. Och, come on, let's go. "
2912,"DOCTOR: Well, where would you like to go? "
2913,JAMIE: I couldn't care less. 
2914,"DOCTOR: I was fond of her too, you know, Jamie.  "
