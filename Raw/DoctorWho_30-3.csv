21, (An advertisement is running on a big screen that
22,"takes up the entire wall opposite the desk. It features the Ood, those"
23,"creatures with tentacles for mouths from Impossible Planet, who speak"
24,through a globe they hold in their hand.) 
25,NARRATOR : The Ood. They came from distant world. They voyaged
26,"across the stars, all with one purpose. "
27,OOD: Do you take milk and sugar? 
28,NARRATOR : To serve. 
29,"BARTLE: That's good. That's excellent. I like it, sir. Buy one now."
30,Direct. Straight to the point. 
31,(He is speaking into his wrist-comm.) 
32,"HALPEN : We play that across the Tri-galactic for two weeks, then"
33,introduce this. 
34,NARRATOR : Now only fifty credits. 
35,BARTLE: Fifty? We're reducing the price to fifty credits? 
36,HALPEN : Sales are down. We've got to reposition ourselves. So get
37,going. 
38,(Communication ends.) 
39,"BARTLE: Idiot. Bleeding us dry. You, there. Get me last month's"
40,military export figures. The army always need more grunts. 
41,"OOD: Yes, sir. "
42,(A woman's voice comes over the intercom. She has a slight Indian
43,accent.) 
44,"SOLANA : Mister Bartle, you asked me to call you? "
45,"BARTLE: Solana, when those buyers arrive we're going to pitch like"
46,never before. I want those Ood flying out of here. 
47,(The Ood hands him a folder.) 
48,BARTLE: That. I said military figures. That's the domestic files. Get
49,me the military. 
50,(The Ood slams the file on the desk. Its eyes are glowing red.) 
51,"OOD: The file is irrelevant, sir. "
52,BARTLE: Oh? And why's that? 
53,(The Ood zaps him with its globe.) 
54,OOD: Have a nice day.
55,
56,[Tardis]
57,
58,(The Tardis is rocking back and forth in flight.
59,The Doctor stops it.) 
60,DOCTOR: Set the controls to random. Mystery tour. Outside that door
61,"could be any planet, anywhere, anywhen in the whole wide u. Are you all"
62,right? 
63,"DONNA: Terrified. I mean, history's one thing but an alien planet? "
64,DOCTOR: I could always take you home. 
65,"DONNA: Yeah, don't laugh at me. "
66,DOCTOR: I know what it's like. Everything you're feeling right now. The
67,"fear, the joy, the wonder? I get that. "
68,DONNA: Seriously? After all this time? 
69,DOCTOR: Yeah. Why do you think I keep going? 
70,"DONNA: Oh. All right then, you and me both. This is barmy. I was born"
71,in Chiswick. I've only ever had package holidays. Now I'm here. This is
72,"so. I mean it's. I don't know, it's all sort of. I don't even know what"
73,the word is. 
74,[Planet surface]
75,
76,(Donna goes outside.) 
77,"DONNA: Oh, I've got the word. Freezing. "
78,"DOCTOR: Snow! Oh, real snow. Proper snow at last. That's more like it."
79,Lovely. What do you think? 
80,DONNA: Bit cold. 
81,DOCTOR: Look at that view. 
82,(Massive icicles hang from bridges of rock over vast ravines.) 
83,"DONNA: Yep. Beautiful, cold view. "
84,"DOCTOR: Millions of planets, millions of galaxies, and we're on this"
85,"one. Molto bene. Bellissimo, says Donna, born in Chiswick. All you've"
86,"got is a life of work and sleep, and telly and rent and tax and"
87,"takeaway dinners, all birthdays and Christmases and two weeks holiday a"
88,"year, and then you end up here. Donna Noble, citizen of the Earth,"
89,standing on a different planet. How about that Donna? 
90,(Donna has disappeared.) 
91,DOCTOR: Donna? 
92,(Donna comes out of the Tardis in a big fur coat with a hood.) 
93,"DONNA: Sorry, you were saying? "
94,DOCTOR: Better? 
95,"DONNA: Lovely, thanks. "
96,DOCTOR: Comfy? 
97,DONNA: Yep. 
98,DOCTOR: Can you hear anything inside that? 
99,DONNA: Pardon? 
100,"DOCTOR: All right, I was saying, citizen of the Earth "
101,(A space rocket glides slowly above them.) 
102,"DONNA: Rocket. Blimey, a real proper rocket. Now that's what I call a"
103,"spaceship. You've got a box, he's got a Ferrari. Come on, lets go see"
104,where he's going.
105,
106,[Factory complex]
107,
108,(The rocket has landed in a small area between lots
109,of factory and warehouse buildings. Its occupants are greeted by a man
110,in a white coat.) 
111,"RYDER: Mister Halpen, sir. Doctor Ryder, new head of Ood Management. "
112,"HALPEN: How many dead? Come on, facts and figures. I haven't flown all"
113,"this way to discuss the weather, which by the way is freezing. "
114,"RYDER: Solana has the figures, sir. "
115,"SOLANA: Solana Mercurio, sir. Head of Marketing and Galactic Liaison. "
116,HALPEN: That's just what I need. A PR woman. I don't want a word of
117,"this getting out, is that understood? Now, get to the point. How many"
118,dead? 
119,[Office]
120,
121,SOLANA: In the past financial quarter we've had
122,"three deaths in the complex, all attributed to heart attacks or"
123,"industrial accidents. But now we've captured this on tape, the cause"
124,would seem the same. 
125,(We hear Bartle's scream as his Ood kills him.) 
126,HALPEN: It's using the translator ball as a weapon. How's that work? 
127,"RYDER: Well, no idea. I'm checking the equipment. Nothing so far. "
128,HALPEN: Can't see its eyes from this angle. 
129,RYDER: I think we have to assume 
130,HALPEN: Red eye. 
131,"RYDER: I would think so, sir. "
132,HALPEN: That Ood. What happened to it? 
133,"RYDER: Oh, ran for the wild, sir, like a dog. One of the guards fired"
134,off a shot. It'll be dead by now. 
135,"SOLANA: Can I ask? What's red eye, sir? "
136,"RYDER: Well, it's some sort of infection. The Ood eyes literally change"
137,colour. 
138,HALPEN: Drink. 
139,(An Ood moves to obey.) 
140,RYDER: I can't find a source. All the bacterial scans register
141,negative. 
142,"SOLANA: Sorry, but according to your own rules, sir, there's no alcohol"
143,allowed on base. 
144,(The Ood hands Halpen a small glass.) 
145,"HALPEN: It's hair tonic, if you must know. Five years ago I had a full"
146,"head of hair. Stress, that's what this is. Stress."
147,
148,[Planet surface]
149,
150,(A delicate music can be heard as they cross a rock
151,bridge.) 
152,"DOCTOR: Hold on, can you hear that? Donna, take your hood down. "
153,DONNA: What? 
154,DOCTOR: That noise is like a song. Over there. 
155,"(An Ood lies on the ground, partly covered in snow.) "
156,DONNA: What is it? 
157,DOCTOR: An Ood. He's called an Ood. 
158,DONNA: But it's face. 
159,"DOCTOR: Donna, don't. Not now. It's a he, not an it. Give me a hand. "
160,DONNA: Sorry. 
161,DOCTOR: I don't know where the heart is. I don't know if he's got a
162,"heart. Talk to him, keep him going. "
163,"DONNA: It's all right, we've got you. Er, what's your name? "
164,DELTA 50: Designated Ood Delta 50. 
165,(Donna speaks into his translator ball.) 
166,DONNA: My name's Donna. 
167,"DOCTOR: No. No, no, no. You don't need to. "
168,"DONNA: Sorry. Oh, God. This is the Doctor. Just what you need, a"
169,"doctor. Couldn't be better, hey? "
170,DOCTOR: You've been shot. 
171,DELTA 50: The circle. 
172,"DONNA: No, don't try to talk. "
173,DELTA 50: The circle must be broken. 
174,"DOCTOR: Circle? What do you mean? Delta 50, what circle? Delta 50? What"
175,circle? 
176,"(Delta 50 sits up with a roar, and red eyes, then exhales and falls"
177,back dead). 
178,DONNA: He's gone. 
179,DOCTOR: Careful. 
180,"DONNA: There you are, sweetheart. We were too late. What do we do, do"
181,we bury him? 
182,DOCTOR: The snow'll take care of that. 
183,DONNA: Who was he? What's an Ood? 
184,DOCTOR: They're servants of humans in the forty second century. Mildly
185,telepathic. That was the song. It was his mind calling out. 
186,DONNA: I couldn't hear anything. He sang as he was dying. 
187,DOCTOR: His eyes turned red. 
188,DONNA: What's that mean? 
189,DOCTOR: Trouble. Come on. The Ood are harmless. They're completely
190,"benign. Except, the last time I met them, there was this force, like a"
191,"stronger mind, powerful enough to take them over. "
192,DONNA: What sort of force? 
193,"DOCTOR: Oh, long story. "
194,DONNA: Long walk. 
195,DOCTOR: It was the Devil. 
196,"DONNA: If you're going to take the mickey, I'll just put my hood back"
197,up. 
198,"DOCTOR: Must be something different this time, though. Something closer"
199,to home. Ah ha! Civilisation.
200,
201,[Factory complex]
202,
203,"SOLANA: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ood"
204,"Sphere. And isn't it bracing? Here are your information packs, with"
205,"vouchers, 3D tickets and a map of the complex. My name's Solana, Head"
206,"of Marketing. I'm sure we've all spoken on the vidfone. Now, if you'd"
207,like to follow me. 
208,(The Doctor and Donna join them.) 
209,"DOCTOR: Sorry, sorry, sorry. Late. Don't mind us. Hello. The guards let"
210,us through. 
211,SOLANA: And you would be? 
212,DOCTOR: The Doctor and Donna Noble. 
213,"DONNA: Representing the Noble Corporation PLC Limited, Intergalactic. "
214,SOLANA: Must have fallen off my list. My apologies. Won't happen again.
215,"Now then, Doctor Noble, Mrs Noble, if you'd like to come with me. "
216,"DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no. We're not married. "
217,DONNA: We're so not married. 
218,DOCTOR: Never. 
219,DONNA: Never ever. 
220,"SOLANA: Of course. And here are your information packs, vouchers"
221,"inside. Now if you'd like to come with me, the Executive Suites are"
222,nice and warm. 
223,(An alarm sounds.) 
224,"DOCTOR: Oh, what's that? That sounds like an alarm. "
225,[Office]
226,
227,"HALPEN: For God's sake, we've got the buyers"
228,"arriving, who sounded the alarm? Drink. "
229,[Factory complex]
230,
231,"SOLANA: Oh, it's just a siren for the end of the"
232,"work shift. Now then, this way, quick as you can. "
233,[Office]
234,
235,"HALPEN: Mister Kess, what the hell's going on? "
236,"KESS : Ood on the loose, sir. "
237,[Factory complex]
238,
239,KESS: Looks like we've got another one. 
240,[Office]
241,
242,HALPEN: Red eye? 
243,"KESS : As red as sin, sir. "
244,[Factory complex]
245,
246,"KESS: Don't worry, Mister Halpen, we're on it. "
247,(The Ood runs behind them.) 
248,GUARD: Sir! 
249,"KESS: All right, then, lads. Go! Get him! "
250,[Presentation area]
251,
252,"(Three Ood are standing on small platforms, whilst"
253,others are taking round trays of drinks.) 
254,"SOLANA: As you can see, the Ood are happy to serve, and we keep them in"
255,"facilities of the highest standard. Here at the Double O, that's Ood"
256,"Operations, we like to think of the Ood as our trusted friends."
257,
258,[Factory complex]
259,
260,KESS: He's over there. You two follow me. 
261,[Presentation area]
262,
263,"SOLANA: We keep the Ood healthy, safe, and"
264,educated. 
265,[Factory complex]
266,
267,KESS: Take him alive. 
268,[Presentation area]
269,
270,SOLANA: We don't just breed the Ood. We make them
271,"better. Because at heart, what is an Ood, but a reflection of us? If"
272,"your Ood is happy, then you'll be happy, too. "
273,[Factory complex]
274,
275,"(Trapped, the Ood growls.) "
276,"KESS: Mister Halpen? This is a bit more than red eye, sir. This is"
277,"something new. It's rabid, sir. "
278,[Office]
279,
280,HALPEN: Take it to Doctor Ryder. Just get it out of
281,sight. 
282,"MAN : Sales figures needed by 19,00 sir. "
283,"HALPEN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. "
284,(Halpen checks his hairline in a mirror.) 
285,HALPEN: What do you think? Growing back? Just a little bit? Like you'd
286,know. 
287,[Presentation area] 
288,SOLANA: I'd now like to point out a new innovation
289,from Ood Operations. We've introduced a variety package with the Ood
290,translator ball. You can now have the standard setting. How are you
291,"today, Ood? "
292,"OOD 1: I'm perfectly well, thank you. "
293,"SOLANA: Or perhaps after a stressful day, a little something for the"
294,"gentlemen. And how are you, Ood? "
295,OOD 2: (husky female) All the better for seeing you. 
296,"SOLANA: And the comedy classic option. Ood, you dropped something. "
297,OOD 3: (Homer Simpson) D'oh. 
298,SOLANA: All that for only five additional credits. The details are in
299,"your brochures. Now, there's plenty more food and drink, so don't hold"
300,back.
301,(Solana leaves. The Doctor goes to her lectern and uses its computer
302,access to light up the big screen.) 
303,"DOCTOR: Ah, got it. The Ood Sphere, I've been to this solar system"
304,before. Years ago. Ages. Close to the planet Sense Sphere. Let's widen
305,out. The year 4126. That is the Second Great and Bountiful Human Empire.
306,"(That would be story 7, season 1, The Sensorites.) "
307,DONNA: 4126? It's 4126. I'm in 4126. 
308,"DOCTOR: It's good, isn't it? "
309,DONNA: What's the Earth like now? 
310,"DOCTOR: Bit full. But you see, the Empire stretches out across three"
311,galaxies. 
312,"DONNA: It's weird. I mean, it's brilliant, but. Back home, the papers"
313,"and the telly, they keep saying we haven't got long to live. Global"
314,"warming, flooding, all the bees disappearing. "
315,DOCTOR: Yeah. That thing about the bees is odd. 
316,"DONNA: But look at us. We're everywhere. Is that good or bad, though? I"
317,"mean, are we like explorers? Or more like a virus? "
318,DOCTOR: Sometimes I wonder. 
319,DONNA: What are the red dots? 
320,DOCTOR: Ood distribution centres. 
321,DONNA: Across three galaxies? Don't the Ood get a say in this? 
322,(Donna goes to an Ood.) 
323,"DONNA: Er, sorry, but. "
324,(Donna gently touches his arm and he turns to look at her.) 
325,"DONNA: Hello. Tell me, are you all like this? "
326,"OOD 1: I do not understand, Miss. "
327,DONNA: Why do you say Miss? Do I look single? 
328,DOCTOR: Back to the point. 
329,"DONNA: Yeah. What I mean is, are there any free Ood? Are there Ood"
330,"running wild somewhere, like wildebeest. "
331,"OOD 1: All Ood are born to serve. Otherwise, we would die. "
332,"DONNA: But you can't have started like that. Before the humans, what"
333,were you like? 
334,OOD 1: The circle. 
335,DOCTOR: What do you mean? What circle? 
336,OOD 1: The circle. The circle is 
337,"SOLANA: Ladies and gentlemen. All Ood to hospitality stations, please. "
338,DOCTOR: I've had enough of the schmoozing. Do you fancy going off the
339,beaten track? 
340,(He holds a map of the complex.) 
341,"SOLANA: Now, if I can introduce you "
342,DONNA: Rough guide to the Ood Sphere? Works for me. 
343,DOCTOR: Yeah.
344,
345,[Detention room]
346,
347,(The snarling Ood is chained to the ceiling.) 
348,HALPEN: What the hell is wrong with it? 
349,RYDER: It's obviously stage two of red eye. Whatever that means. 
350,"HALPEN: Ood Sigma, have you seen this before? "
351,"SIGMA: Humanity defines us, sir. We look to you for answers. "
352,"HALPEN: Oh, fat lot of good, all of you. We're exporting hundreds of"
353,"thousands of Ood to all the civilised planets. If they turn rabid, you"
354,know what it'll mean. 
355,"RYDER: There's only one thing I haven't checked, sir. Warehouse"
356,Fifteen. 
357,HALPEN: Why should that cause trouble? It's been two centuries now. No
358,"change, not ever. Drink. "
359,"RYDER: I know it's restricted access, but if I'm going to work on this,"
360,I should see it. Just in case. 
361,"HALPEN: Can't stand the place. Still, Warehouse Fifteen then. Come on. "
362,"RYDER: What about this one, sir? "
363,"HALPEN: Well, I'd suggest a post mortem. Which means it's got to be"
364,dead first. 
365,(Halpen leaves. We hear gunfire.)
366,
367,[Factory complex]
368,
369,(The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver on a gate in
370,the wire mesh fencing.) 
371,TANNOY: Ood shift eight now commencing. Repeat. Ood shift eight now
372,commencing. 
373,(The Doctor and Donna watch the Ood marching through in double file
374,from an upper catwalk. One at the back falls down.) 
375,KESS: Get up. I said get up. 
376,(Kess cracks a whip.) 
377,DONNA: Servants? They're slaves. 
378,KESS: Get up! March. 
379,"DOCTOR: Last time I met the Ood, I never thought. I never asked. "
380,DONNA: That's not like you. 
381,DOCTOR: I was busy. So busy I couldn't save them. I had to let the Ood
382,die. I reckon I owe them one. 
383,DONNA: That looks like the boss. 
384,DOCTOR: Let's keep out of his way. Come on. 
385,RYDER: How long since you went inside? 
386,HALPEN: Must be ten years ago. 
387,(Halpen enters the code to unlock the door.) 
388,COMPUTER: Warehouse Fifteen. 
389,HALPEN: My father brought me here when I was six years old. 
390,COMPUTER: Security protocol initiated. 
391,"HALPEN: God, the stench of it. "
392,COMPUTER: Warehouse Fifteen door open. 
393,[Warehouse 15]
394,
395,"(Apparently, it still smells. The place is lit with"
396,"red light, and there is the sound of electricity zapping around. Halpen"
397,"and Ryder, Ood Sigma and two guards stop on a catwalk.) "
398,RYDER: Incredible. 
399,"HALPEN: Like I said, nothing's changed. "
400,"RYDER: I've read the documents, but it doesn't quite prepare you. "
401,"HALPEN: Is it just me, or does it feel as if it's looking at you? "
402,RYDER: I think I understand the barrier mechanics well enough. I'll
403,check the signal. 
404,HALPEN: I suppose it's home sweet home to you. What do you think? 
405,"SIGMA: I have no opinion, sir. "
406,"HALPEN: Well, say hello to Daddy. "
407,RYDER: Nothing. The barrier's intact. No abnormal signal. Same as it's
408,been for two hundred years. 
409,"SOLANA : Mister Halpen, the two people from the Noble Corporation"
410,failed to pass security checks. 
411,[Presentation area]
412,
413,"SOLANA: There's no such company, the Noble"
414,"Corporation doesn't exist. And on top of that, they seem to have gone"
415,"missing, sir. "
416,[Warehouse 15]
417,
418,SOLANA : The Doctor and Miss Noble. 
419,"HALPEN: Just what I need. Start a search. No alarms, got that? Keep it"
420,"quiet. You see? Hair loss. Drink. Tell you what, old friend. Have this"
421,one on me. Cheers. 
422,(Halpen pours his hair restorer onto whatever they are looking down on.
423,Something growls.) 
424,HALPEN: I think we're finished here. 
425,(Halpen leaves. Ryder bumps into Sigma.) 
426,RYDER: Sorry. 
427,"(Sigma looks down at whatever it is, then follows.)"
428,
429,[Factory complex]
430,
431,(Donna stops by a door as the Doctor walks on. She
432,puts two fingers into her mouth and blows.) 
433,DOCTOR: Where'd you learn to whistle? 
434,"DONNA: West Ham, every Saturday. "
435,(He unlocks the door.) 
436,[Ood Cargo]
437,
438,(It is full of shipping containers.) 
439,"DOCTOR: Ood export. You see? Lifts up the containers, takes them to the"
440,"rocket sheds, ready to be flown out all over the three galaxies. "
441,"DONNA: What, you mean, these containers are full of? "
442,DOCTOR: What do you think? 
443,[Shipping container]
444,
445,(The Ood are standing silently.) 
446,"DONNA: Oh, it stinks. How many of them do you think there are in each"
447,one? 
448,DOCTOR: Hundred? More? 
449,DONNA: A great big empire built on slavery. 
450,DOCTOR: It's not so different from your time. 
451,DONNA: Oi. I haven't got slaves. 
452,DOCTOR: Who do you think made your clothes? 
453,DONNA: Is that why you travel round with a human at your side? It's not
454,"so you can show them the wonders of the universe, it's so you can take"
455,cheap shots? 
456,DOCTOR: Sorry. 
457,"DONNA: Don't, Spaceman. I don't understand, the door is open, why don't"
458,you just run away? 
459,OOD: For what reason? 
460,DONNA: You could be free. 
461,OOD: I do not understand the concept. 
462,"DONNA: What is it with that Persil ball? I mean, they're not born with"
463,"it, are they? Why do they have to be all plugged in? "
464,"DOCTOR: Ood, tell me. Does the circle mean anything to you? "

466,"DONNA: Oh, that is creepy. "
467,DOCTOR: But what is it? What is the circle? 
468,ALL OOD: The circle must be broken. 
469,DOCTOR: Why? 
470,ALL OOD: So that we can sing.

473,(Up on a catwalk.)

482,"HALPEN: Cut the alarms. I said, no alarms! "

484,
485,"SOLANA: Nothing to worry about, ladies and"

487,every day. If you'll excuse me. 
488,[Ood Cargo]
489,
490,(Donna stops running.) 
491,"DONNA: Doctor, there's a door. "
492,(The door opens and guards enter.) 
493,GUARD: Don't move! 
494,(The Doctor is further away.) 
495,DOCTOR: Where've you gone? 
496,GUARD: Stay where you are. 
497,KESS: Keep her in there for now. 
498,DONNA: Get off me. Get off me! 
499,(Donna is locked in a container with Ood.) 
500,DOCTOR: Donna? Where are you? 
501,KESS: All guards withdraw. 
502,GUARD : Sir? 
503,KESS: I said withdraw. Keep to the perimeter. I've got this one. I've
504,always wanted to do this. 
505,"(Kess actives the claw that moves the containers, and chases the Doctor"
506,with it.)

511,(The Ood have red eyes.) 
512,"DONNA: Oh, no, you don't. What have I done? I'm not one of that lot."
513,"I'm on your side. Stay where you are. That's an order. I said, stay."
514,Doctor? Doctor! 
515,[Ood Cargo]
516,
517,"(Kess knocks the Doctor down with the claw, then"
518,"sends it down towards him. Suddenly, it stops. Solana takes the key"
519,from the controls.) 
520,SOLANA: You heard the instructions. Mister Halpen wants them alive. 
521,[Container]

523,"DONNA: Doctor, get me out! "
524,[Ood Cargo]
525,
526,(Two guards are marching the Doctor away.) 
527,"DONNA : Doctor, get me out of here. "
528,"DOCTOR: If you don't do what she says, you're really in trouble. Not"
529,"from me, from her. "
530,KESS: Unlock the container. 
531,(Donna runs out.)
532,DONNA: Doctor. 
533,"DOCTOR: There we go, safe and sound. "
534,DONNA: Never mind about me. What about them? 
535,(The Ood kill the guard by the container door.) 
536,KESS: Red alert. Fire! 
537,(Ood come out of other containers.) 
538,KESS: Shoot to kill. 
539,"(While the guards fire their guns, the Doctor, Donna and Solana run"

543,DONNA: If people back on Earth knew what was going
544,on here. 
545,"SOLANA: Oh, don't be so stupid. Of course they know. "
546,DONNA: They know how you treat the Ood? 
547,SOLANA: They don't ask. Same thing. 
548,"DOCTOR: Solana, the Ood aren't born like this. They can't be. A species"
549,born to serve could never evolve in the first place. What does the
550,company do to make them obey? 
551,SOLANA: That's nothing to do with me. 
552,"DOCTOR: Oh, what, because you don't ask? "
553,SOLANA: That's Doctor Ryder's territory. 
554,DOCTOR: Where's he? What part of the complex? I could help with the red
555,eye. Now show me. 
556,SOLANA: There. Beyond the red section. 
557,DOCTOR: Come with me. You've seen the warehouse. You can't agree with
558,all this. You know this place better than me. You could help. 
559,SOLANA: They're over here! Guards! They're over here.

568,[Detention area]
569,
570,"KESS: We've contained it, sir. Fenced them in. But"
571,the red eye seems to be permanent this time. It's not fading. Worse
572,"than that, sir, there's more of them going rabid. In my opinion, sir, I"
573,think we've lost them. The entire batch contaminated.

576,HALPEN: What's causing it? Why now? What's changed?

578,"(Halpen strokes his head, and some hair comes away in his fingers.) "
579,HALPEN: How many Ood in total? 
580,[Detention area]

598,listened. 
599,[Ood Conversion]

601,(The Doctor sonics the door lock.) 
602,DONNA: Hold on. Does that mean we're locked in? 
603,"DOCTOR: Listen. Listen, listen, listen, listen. "
604,(The ethereal music.) 
605,"DOCTOR: Oh, my head. "
606,DONNA: What is it? 
607,DOCTOR: Can't you hear it? The singing? 
608,(Groups of Ood are sitting in cages. They turn away from the Doctor and
609,Donna.) 
610,DONNA: They look different to the others. 
611,"DOCTOR: That's because they're natural born Ood, unprocessed, before"
612,they're adapted to slavery. Unspoilt. That's their song. 
613,DONNA: I can't hear it. 
614,DOCTOR: Do you want to? 
615,DONNA: Yeah. 
616,DOCTOR: It's the song of captivity. 
617,DONNA: Let me hear it. 
618,DOCTOR: Face me. 
619,(The Doctor makes a mind meld with Donna.) 
620,"DOCTOR: Open your mind. That's it. Hear it, Donna. Hear the music. "
621,(The song is sad and beautiful. Donna cries.) 
622,DONNA: Take it away. 
623,DOCTOR: Sure? 
624,DONNA: I can't bear it. 
625,(The Doctor disconnects her from the telepathic field.) 
626,DONNA: I'm sorry. 
627,DOCTOR: It's okay. 
628,DONNA: But you can still hear it. 
629,DOCTOR: All the time.

631,[Outside Ood Conversion]
632,
633,HALPEN: Come on. What's the hold up? 
634,RYDER: It's the experimentation lab. Maximum security. He's fused the
635,system. 
636,"HALPEN: Don't just stand there, get the bolt cutters. Rip that door"
637,"off. Solana, go back to the reps, I don't want any of them wandering"
638,"off and seeing this. And get them away from the Ood, just in case."

646,"DOCTOR: Ah, let them. "
647,(The Ood cower in the corner.) 
648,"DOCTOR: What are you holding? Show me. Friend. Doctor, Donna. Friend."
649,"Let me see. Look at me. Let me see. That's it. That's it, go on. Go on."
650,
651,(The Ood opens his hands. He is holding a small brain.) 
652,DONNA: Is that? 
653,DOCTOR: It's a brain. A hind brain. The Ood are born with a secondary
654,"brain. Like the amygdala in humans, it processes memory and emotions."
655,"You get rid of that, you wouldn't be Donna any more. You'd be like an"
656,Ood. A processed Ood. 
657,DONNA: So the company cuts off their brains? 
658,DOCTOR: And they stitch on the translator. 
659,"DONNA: Like a lobotomy. I spent all that time looking for you, Doctor,"
660,because I thought it was so wonderful out here. I want to go home. 
661,(Crash!) 
662,"GUARD : They're with the Ood, sir. "
663,(The Doctor locks himself and Donna in with the Ood.)

671,"DOCTOR: If that's what Friends Of The Ood are trying to prove, then"
672,yes. 
673,"HALPEN: The Ood were nothing without us, just animals roaming around on"
674,the ice. 
675,DOCTOR: That's because you can't hear them. 
676,HALPEN: They welcomed it. It's not as if they put up a fight. 
677,DONNA: You idiot. They're born with their brains in their hands. Don't
678,"you see, that makes them peaceful. They've got to be,"
679,because a creature like that would have to trust anyone it meets. 
680,"DOCTOR: Oh, nice one. "
681,DONNA: Thank you. 
682,HALPEN: The system's worked for two hundred years. All we've got is a
683,rogue batch. But the infection is about to be sterilised. Mister Kess.
684,How do we stand?

701,SOLANA: Could I ask all the Ood to withdraw. It's feeding time. 
702,The Oods put their hands to their heads.) 
703,"REP: Ah, you've upset them. Leave them alone. "

752,"HALPEN: Everything you wanted, Doctor. No doubt there'll be a full"
753,"police investigation once this place has been sterilised, so I can't"

755,"DOCTOR: But Mister Halpen, there's something else, isn't there?"
756,Something we haven't seen. 
757,DONNA: What do you mean? 
758,DOCTOR: A creature couldn't survive with a separate forebrain and hind
759,"brain, they'd be at war with themselves. There's got to be something"
760,"else, a third element, am I right? "
761,"HALPEN: And again, so clever. "
762,DOCTOR: But it's got to be connected to the red eye. What is it?

813,HALPEN: It's always been an option. My grandfather
814,"drew up this plan. That's the advantage of a family run business,"
815,Doctor Ryder. The personal touch. 
816,"RYDER: But we should evacuate. If we can get to the rocket sheds, we"
817,can 
818,HALPEN: No need. We've got this. Detonation packs. Place them around
819,the circumference. We're
820,"going to blow it up. This thing dies, so do the Ood. "
821,(They place the devices on the catwalk around the mysterious something
822,"we haven't seen yet. Meanwhile, the Doctor sonics the door controls and"
823,they get in. He looks down on -) 
824,"DOCTOR: The Ood Brain. Now it all makes sense, That's the missing link."
825,"The third element, binding them together. Forebrain, hind brain, and"
826,"this, the telepathic centre. It's a shared mind, connecting all the Ood"
827,in song. 
828,"HALPEN: Cargo. I can always go into cargo. I've got the rockets, I've"
829,"got the sheds. Smaller business. Much more manageable, without"
830,livestock. 
831,RYDER: He's mined the area. 
832,DONNA: You're going to kill it? 
833,HALPEN: They found that thing centuries ago beneath the Northern
834,Glacier. 
835,DOCTOR: Those pylons. 
836,DONNA: In a circle. The circle must be broken. 
837,DOCTOR: Damping the telepathic field. Stopping the Ood from connecting
838,for two hundred years. 
839,"HALPEN: And you, Ood Sigma, you brought them here. I expected better. "
840,"SIGMA: My place is at your side, sir. "
841,HALPEN: Still subservient. Good Ood. 
842,"DONNA: If that barrier thing's in place, how come the Ood started"
843,breaking out? 
844,DOCTOR: Maybe it's taken centuries to adapt. The subconscious reaching
845,out? 
846,RYDER: But the process was too slow. It had to be accelerated. You
847,"should never give me access to the controls, Mister Halpen. I lowered"
848,"the barrier to its minimum. Friends Of The Ood, sir. It's taken me ten"
849,"years to infiltrate the company, and I succeeded. "
850,"HALPEN: Yes. Yes, you did. "
851,"(Halpen throws Ryder over the catwalk railing and onto the giant brain,"
852,which absorbs him.) 
853,DONNA: You murdered him. 
854,"HALPEN: Very observant, Ginger. Now, then. Can't say I've ever shot"
855,anyone before. Can't say I'm
856,"going to like it. But er, it's not exactly a normal day, is it? Still. "
857,"SIGMA: Would you like a drink, sir? "
858,"HALPEN: I think hair loss is the least of my problems right now,"
859,thanks. 
860,(Sigma stands in front of the Doctor.) 
861,"SIGMA: Please have a drink, sir. "
862,"HALPEN: If, if you're going to stand in their way, I'll shoot you too. "
863,"SIGMA: Please have a drink, sir. "
864,"HALPEN: Have, have you poisoned me? "
865,"SIGMA: Natural Ood must never kill, sir. "
866,DOCTOR: What is that stuff? 
867,"SIGMA: Ood graft suspended in a biological compound, sir. "
868,HALPEN: What the hell does that mean? 
869,"DOCTOR: Oh, dear. "
870,HALPEN: Tell me! 
871,"DOCTOR: Funny thing, the subconscious. Takes all sorts of shapes. Came"
872,"out in the red eye as revenge, came out in the rabid Ood as anger, and"
873,"then there was patience. All that intelligence and mercy, focused on"
874,"Ood Sigma. How's the hair loss, Mister Halpen? "
875,(More hair comes away in Halpen's hand.) 
876,HALPEN: What have you done? 
877,"DOCTOR: Oh, they've been preparing you for a very long time. And now"
878,"you're standing next to the Ood Brain, Mister Halpen, can you hear it?"
879,Listen. 
880,HALPEN: What have you? I'm not. 
881,"(Halpen's face goes blank. He drops his gun, reaches for his head and"
882,peels the skin off. Then tentacles come out of his mouth.) 
883,"DONNA: They, they turned him into an Ood? "
884,DOCTOR: Yep. 
885,DONNA: He's an Ood. 
886,DOCTOR: I noticed. 
887,(Halpen sneezes and a small hind brain flops into his hands.) 
888,"SIGMA: He has become Oodkind, and we will take care of him. "
889,"DONNA: It's weird, being with you. I can't tell what's right and what's"
890,wrong any more. 
891,DOCTOR: It's better that way. People who know for certain tend to be
892,like Mister Halpen. 
893,(Beep beep.) 
894,DOCTOR: Oh! 
895,(The Doctor deactivates the explosives.) 
896,"DOCTOR: That's better. And now, Sigma, would you allow me the honour? "
897,"SIGMA: It is yours, Doctor. "
898,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes! Stifled for two hundred years, but not any more. The"
899,circle is broken. The Ood can sing. 
900,"(The current around the Brain is shut off and the song starts up, slow"
901,but happy.) 
902,DONNA: I can hear it! 
903,(The fighting stops. The Ood raise their palms to the sky and join in.)
904,
905,[Planet surface]
906,
907,DOCTOR: The message has gone out. That song
908,resonated across the galaxies. Everyone heard it. Everyone knows. The
909,rockets are bringing them back. The Ood are coming home. 
910,"SIGMA: We thank you, Doctor Donna, friends of Oodkind. And what of you"
911,now? Will you stay? There is room in the song for you. 
912,"DOCTOR: Oh, I've, I've sort of got a song of my own, thanks. "
913,SIGMA: I think your song must end soon. 
914,DOCTOR: Meaning? 
915,SIGMA: Every song must end. 
916,"DOCTOR: Yeah. Er, what about you? You still want to go home? "
917,DONNA: No. Definitely not. 
918,DOCTOR: Then we'll be off. 
919,SIGMA: Take this song with you. 
920,DONNA: We will. 
921,DOCTOR: Always. 
922,"SIGMA: And know this, Doctor Donna. You will never be forgotten. Our"
923,"children will sing of the Doctor Donna, and our children's children,"
924,and the wind and the ice and the snow will carry your names forever.
