70,"time travel. That's just brilliant. Yeah, I've heard a lot about you."
71,I'm their best mate. 
72,DOCTOR: Then why don't I know you? I danced with everyone at the

388,"JIM: Sir, that blue box. I've got a match. We're"
389,"trying to bag war criminals, we've got the biggest one ever right under"
390,"our noses. Forget Hitler. If we take this one down, the Justice"
391,Department will give us the rest of the year off. 
392,CARTER: Are you sure? 
393,JIM: There's no question. It's her. 
394,"AMY: How bad is it? Rory, what can we do? "
395,"RORY: Just keep her conscious. Stay with us, Mels. "
396,"DOCTOR: Hey, look at me. Just hold on. "
397,MELS: I used to dream about you. All those stories Amy used to tell me.
398,
399,DOCTOR: What stories? Tell me what stories. Vampires in Venice. That's
400,a belter. 
401,"MELS: When I was little, I was going to marry you. "

408,"(Mels, obviously short for Melody rather than Melissa, begins to"
409,regenerate.) 
410,RORY: What the hell's going on? 
411,DOCTOR: Back! Back! Back! Get back! 
412,"MELS: Last time I did this, I ended up a toddler in the middle of New"

415,DOCTOR: Mels. Short for 
416,MELS: Melody. 
417,AMY: Yeah. I named my daughter after her. 
418,DOCTOR: You named your daughter after your daughter. 
419,MELS: It took me years to find you two. I'm so glad I did. And you see?
420,"It all worked out in the end, didn't it. You got to raise me after all."
421,
422,AMY: You're Melody? 
423,"RORY: But if she's Melody, that means that she's also "
424,"MELS: Shut up, Dad. I'm focusing on a dress size. "
425,(And Mels transforms into -) 
426,"RIVER: Oh! Oh! Oh! Whoa! Right, let's see, then. Ooo, it's all going on"

437,(She runs off into a side room.) 
438,AMY: That's Melody. 
439,RORY: That's River Song. 
440,RIVER: Who's River Song? 
441,DOCTOR: Spoilers. 
442,"RIVER: Spoilers? What's spoilers? Hang on, just something I have to"
443,check. 
444,RORY: Is anybody else finding today just a bit difficult? I'm getting a
445,sort of banging in my head. 
446,"AMY: Yeah, I think that's Hitler in the cupboard. "
447,RORY: That's not helping. 
448,DOCTOR: This isn't the River Song we know yet. This is her right at the
449,start. Doesn't even know her own name. 
450,"RIVER [OC} Oh, that's magnificent! "
451,RIVER: I'm going to wear lots of jodhpurs.

462,(She has somehow got Hitler's gun.) 
463,"DOCTOR: Oh, hello. I thought we were getting married. "
464,RIVER: I told you I'm not a wedding person. 
465,"RORY: Doctor, what's she doing? "
466,DOCTOR: What she's programmed to. 
467,RORY: Where'd she get the gun? 
468,"DOCTOR: Hello, Benjamin. "
469,"RIVER [memory]: Hello, Benjamin! "
470,(She picked it up from the chair.) 
471,RIVER: You noticed. 
472,"(She tries to fire it, but the chambers are empty.) "
473,DOCTOR: Of course I noticed. 
474,(He took the bullets out while she was regenerating.) 
475,"DOCTOR: As soon as I knew you were coming, I tidied up a bit. "
476,RIVER: I know you did. 
477,RIVER [memory]: Watch out that bow tie. 
478,(She spotted the gun in the fruit bowl.) 
479,DOCTOR: I know you know. 
480,(He turns the bowl and she points a banana at him instead.) 
481,"RIVER: Goodness, is killing you going to take all day? "
482,DOCTOR: Why? Are you busy? 
483,"RIVER: Oh, I'm not complaining. "
484,(She grabs a letter opener and he sonicks it away.) 
485,"DOCTOR: If you were in a hurry, you could've killed me in the"
486,cornfield.

490,"RIVER: Oh, Mummy, Mummy, pay attention. I was trained and conditioned"
491,for one purpose. I was born to kill the Doctor.

995,AMY: You can't die now. I know you don't die now. 
996,"DOCTOR: Oh, Pond, you've got a schedule for everything. "
997,AMY: But it doesn't make any sense. 
998,"RORY: Doctor, what do we do? Come on. How do we help you? "
999,"DOCTOR: No. Sorry, Rory, you can't. Nobody can. Ponds, listen to me. I"
1000,need to talk to your daughter. 
1001,"(Rory and Amy move away from the Doctor, and let River approach.) "
1002,DOCTOR: Find her. Find River Song and tell her something from me. 
1003,RIVER: Tell her what? 
1004,(The Doctor whispers in her ear.) 
1005,"RIVER: Well, I'm sure she knows. "
1006,(The Doctor is dead.) 
1007,RIVER: Who's River Song? 
1008,AMY: Are you still working? Because I'm still a relative. Access files

1011,AMY: Show me her. Show me River Song.

1016,"AMY: What's happening? River, what are you doing? "
1017,"RIVER: Just tell me. The Doctor, is he worth it? "
1018,"AMY: Yes! Yes, he is! "
1019,"(River pours her golden regeneration energy into the Doctor, and he"
1020,revives.)

1026,(River wakes up in a bed.) 
1027,AMY: Hey. 
1028,RIVER: Hey. Where am I? 
1029,"AMY: You're safe now. Apparently, you used all your remaining"
1030,regenerations in one go. You shouldn't have done that. 
1031,"RIVER: Mother, I had to try. "
1032,AMY: I know. 
1033,"RIVER: He said no-one could save him, but he must have known I could. "
1034,DOCTOR: Rule one. The Doctor lies. 
1035,NURSE: She just needs to rest. She'll be absolutely fine.

1045,"AMY: Yeah, but she's our daughter. Doctor, she's River and she's our"
1046,daughter. 
1047,"DOCTOR: Amy, I know. But we have to let her make her own way now. We"
1048,"have too much foreknowledge. Dangerous thing, foreknowledge. "
1049,(His Teselecta biography is on the scanner.) 
1050,AMY: What's that? 
1051,DOCTOR: Nothing. 
1052,(He turns it off.) 
1053,DOCTOR: Just some data I downloaded from the Teselecta. Very boring. 
1054,"RORY: Doctor, River was brainwashed to kill you, right? "
1055,"DOCTOR: Well, she did kill me, and then she used her remaining lives to"
1056,"bring me back. As first dates go, I'd say that was mixed signals. "
1057,"RORY: But that stuff that they put in her head, is that gone now? The"
1058,"River that we know in the future, she is in prison for murder. "
1059,AMY: Whose murder? Will we see her again? 
1060,"DOCTOR: Oh, she'll come looking for us. "
1061,"AMY: Yeah, but how? How do people even look for you? "
1062,"DOCTOR: Oh, Pond. Haven't you figured that one out yet?"
