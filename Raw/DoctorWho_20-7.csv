22,
23, (The late William Hartnell introduces the Doctor
24,Who twentieth anniversary story.) 
25,"DOCTOR 1: One day, I shall come back. Yes, I shall come back. Until"
26,"then, there must be no regrets, no tears, no anxieties. Just go forward"
27,in all your beliefs and prove to me that I am not mistaken in mine.
28,
29,"(On an alien planet, a tall, dark tower rises from"
30,a desolate landscape. A susurration
31,"of voices fills the empty, torch-lit corridors. "
32,"Meanwhile, on another planet, Turlough settles down by a ruin to sketch"
33,"the peaceful rural landscape. Welcome to Plas Brondanw, Gwynedd.)"
34,
35, [Tardis]
36,
37,(The Doctor runs a cloth over his shiny new
38,"console, all gleaming metal and sharp corners with inset control"
39,panels. Tegan enters from the interior.) 
40,TEGAN: Finished? 
41,"DOCTOR 5: Yes. Looks rather splendid, doesn't it? "
42,TEGAN: But will the Tardis work properly? 
43,"DOCTOR 5: Of course, once everything's run in. "
44,TEGAN: Didn't you repair anything? 
45,"DOCTOR 5: Well, the Tardis is more than a machine, Tegan. It's like a"
46,"person. It needs coaxing, persuading, encouraging. "
47,TEGAN: You mean it's just as unreliable. 
48,"DOCTOR 5: You have little faith, Tegan. "
49,"(The Doctor pulls the door lever, and they fail to open.) "
50,TEGAN: Do you blame me? 
51,(A well aimed thump opens the doors.)
52,
53, [Eye of Orion]
54,
55, (The Tardis is parked inside the ruins. The Doctor
56,goes out through an archway to where Turlough is sketching.) 
57,TURLOUGH: It's marvellous here. I feel so calm and relaxed. 
58,DOCTOR 5: It's the high bombardment of positive ions. 
59,TEGAN: It's like Earth after a thunderstorm. 
60,DOCTOR 5: Same cause and reason. 
61,TEGAN: It's beautiful. 
62,"DOCTOR 5: For some, the Eye of Orion is the most tranquil place in the"
63,universe. 
64,TEGAN: Can't we stay here? 
65,DOCTOR 5: Why not? For a while. We could do with a rest. 
66,"(Somewhere, a gloved hand turns a ball control by an illuminated"
67,pentagon with a model of the tower in the middle. An image of the Dark
68,"Tower appears on a screen, then we go to an enclosed garden where the"
69,"First Doctor is taking a stroll. Everyone say Hi! to  Richard Hurndall,"
70,who did a magnificent job in the role. Suddenly he sees a conical
71,"object coming at him from the sky. The elderly gentleman tries to run,"
72,but it quickly sweeps him up. The gloved hand picks up a model of him
73,and places it on one segment of the pentagon. 
74,The Fifth Doctor clutches his chest in sudden pain.) 
75,DOCTOR 5: Ah! 
76,TURLOUGH: Are you all right? 
77,DOCTOR 5: Just a twinge of cosmic angst. 
78,TEGAN: Cosmic? 
79,DOCTOR 5: As if I'd lost something.
80,
81, [Colonel's office]
82,
83," (Denham Manors, playing UNIT HQ. David Savile,"
84,"last seen in War Games, is in Army uniform. He pours a whisky for"
85,"Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart, who is retired and in civilian clothes.) "
86,CRICHTON: Right. 
87,BRIGADIER: Thank you. 
88,"CRICHTON: Well, to civilian life. "
89,"BRIGADIER: You know, I can't tell you how much I was looking forward to"
90,this reunion. A chance of re-meeting old friends. 
91,CRICHTON: There was one chap we tried to get hold of. What was his
92,name? Used to be your scientific advisor. 
93,"BRIGADIER: Oh, the Doctor. "
94,CRICHTON: Yes that's right. 
95,BRIGADIER: Wonderful chap. All of them. 
96,CRICHTON: Them? 
97,(The intercom beeps.) 
98,CRICHTON: Yes? 
99,"SERGEANT : Excuse me, sir, sorry to interrupt. Someone's arrived. "
100,CRICHTON: I'm not expecting anyone.
101,
102, [Outer office]
103,
104, SERGEANT: Insists on seeing Brigadier Lethbridge
105,Stewart. 
106,CRICHTON : How did he know he was here? 
107,(A figure in a big fur coat heads for the door.) 
108,"SERGEANT: I'm sorry, sir, you're not allowed in there. "
109,DOCTOR2: Not allowed? Me? I'm allowed everywhere.
110,
111, [Colonel's office]
112,
113, (The Sergeant grabs at the Doctor's coat. The
114,Doctor does a neat turn resulting in him taking the coat off.) 
115,"DOCTOR2: Oh, thank you. Brigadier. "
116,BRIGADIER: Good heavens. Is it you? 
117,"DOCTOR2: Yes, yes. For once, I was able to steer the Tardis. And here"
118,I am. 
119,"CRICHTON: It's all right, Sergeant. "
120,"SERGEANT: Very good, sir. "
121,(The Sergeant hangs up the Doctor's coat and leaves.) 
122,"DOCTOR 2: I'm not too late, am I? "
123,BRIGADIER: What for? 
124,DOCTOR 2: For your speech as guest of honour. 
125,BRIGADIER: How did you know? 
126,DOCTOR 2: I saw it in the Times. 
127,CRICHTON: That's impossible. The reporter's still here. 
128,"DOCTOR 2: Tomorrow's Times. And, er, and who is this? "
129,"BRIGADIER: That's Colonel Crichton, my replacement. "
130,"DOCTOR 2: Ah. Yes, mine was pretty unpromising, too. "
131,"BRIGADIER: Come along, Doctor, we'll take a stroll round the ground,"
132,shall we? Awfully sorry about this. Do excuse me for a moment. DOCTOR
133,"DOCTOR2: You've had this place redecorated, haven't you? Hmm. Don't like it. "
134,(The Brigadier collects their coats and goes to the French windows.) 
135,"BRIGADIER: Come along, Doctor. "
136,DOCTOR 2: After you. 
137,BRIGADIER: What? 
138,DOCTOR 2: After you. 
139,"BRIGADIER: Oh, very well. "
140,"(Outside, the Brigadier helps the Doctor on with his coat. The Sergeant"
141,enters.) 
142,"SERGEANT: Everything all right, sir? "
143,CRICHTON: What the blazes is going on? Who was that strange little man?
144,
145,SERGEANT: The Doctor. 
146,CRICHTON: Who?
147,
148, [Outside UNIT HQ]
149,
150,(The Doctor fastens his coat with a piece of
151,string.) 
152,"BRIGADIER: Yes. Yeti, Cybermen. We've seen some times, Doctor. "
153,DOCTOR 2: And Omega. Don't forget Omega. 
154,BRIGADIER: As if I could! 
155,DOCTOR 2: And the terrible Zodin. 
156,BRIGADIER: Who? 
157,"DOCTOR 2: Oh, you weren't concerned with her, were you? She happened in"
158,the future. They were covered in hair. Used to hop like kangaroos.
159,"Well, I must say goodbye, Brigadier. I really shouldn't be here at all."
160,"I'm not exactly breaking the laws of time, but I am bending them a"
161,little. 
162,"BRIGADIER: You never did bother much about rules, as I remember. What's"
163,the matter? 
164,(The conical object is heading their way.) 
165,BRIGADIER: What is it? 
166,"DOCTOR 2: Brigadier, I think our past is catching up on us. Or maybe"
167,"it's our future. Come on, run! "
168,(They run for the trees.) 
169,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, I'm too old for his sort of thing. "
170,DOCTOR 2: Where's it gone? We must get back to the Tardis before it's
171,too late. Run! 
172,(But the cone gets them both. The gloved hand places two figures in
173,another section of the pentagon.)
174,
175, [Eye of Orion]
176,
177,"TEGAN: Doctor, what is it? "
178,DOCTOR 5: It's fading. It's all fading. 
179,TURLOUGH: What's fading? 
180,"DOCTOR 5: Great chunks of my past, detaching themselves like melting"
181,icebergs. Ah!
182,(More pain.) 
183,TEGAN: Do something. Help him! 
184,"DOCTOR 5: Oh, no. No, don't look so worried. I'll have it all worked"
185,out soon. Everything's all right. Everything's quite all right. 
186,"(The Doctor puts his hands on Turlough and Tegan's shoulders, and"
187,collapses.)
188,
189,[Country road]
190,
191, (The Third Doctor is driving along in Bessie when
192,he sees the cone coming for him.) 
193,DOCTOR 3: Great balls of fire! 
194,(He turns Bessie around in a junction and floors the accelerator. After
195,a few moments he loses sight of the cone in his wing mirror.) DOCTOR 3:
196,Good old Bessie. 
197,(And promptly gets swept up and taken away. 
198,The gloved hand places his model in the third segment of the pentagon.)
199,
200, [Eye of Orion]
201,
202,TEGAN: What's happening to him? What are we going
203,to do? 
204,TURLOUGH: He seems to be under some kind of psychic attack. 
205,"DOCTOR 5: I am being diminished. Whittled away, piece by piece. A man"
206,"is the sum of his memories, you know. A Time Lord even more so. "
207,TEGAN: What can we do to help you? 
208,DOCTOR 5: Get me into the Tardis. 
209,(They carry him back into the ruins.) 
210,"DOCTOR 5: Ah! I have to find, to find "
211,TURLOUGH: Find what? 
212,DOCTOR 5: My other selves.
213,
214," [West Common Road, Uxbridge]"
215,
216, (Sarah Jane Smith comes out of her house. K9
217,trundles down the driveway.) 
218,"K9: Mistress, do not go out. "
219,SARAH: What is it? 
220,"K9: Danger, Mistress. "
221,SARAH: What? 
222,"K9: I can sense danger, Mistress. Telepathic trace faint but rapidly"
223,increasing in strength. Do not go out. 
224,SARAH: What kind of danger? 
225,K9: Positive data not yet available. 
226,"SARAH: Well, I can't stay home. You have to give me a reason. "
227,"K9: Negative, Mistress. Data analysis shows too many variables. Danger"
228,"readings now becoming much higher, Mistress. Suggestion. Take me with"
229,you. 
230,"SARAH: I can't. Honestly, I can't. The car's in docks so I've got to go"
231,by bus. 
232,"K9: There is danger, Mistress. My sensors indicate it is now extreme."
233,And the Doctor is involved. 
234,"SARAH: Well, now I know you're imagining things. See you later. "
235,(She crosses the road.) 
236,K9: Danger! Doctor! Danger! Mistress!
237,
238, [River Cam]
239,
240," (This scene is lifted from Shada, where the Fourth"
241,Doctor and the First Romana are punting.) 
242,"DOCTOR 4: Wordsworth, Rutherford, Christopher Smart, Andrew Marvell,"
243,"Judge Jeffreys, Owen Chadwick. "
244,ROMANA: Who?Â 
245,"DOCTOR 4: Owen Chadwick. Oh, yes, some of the greatest labourers in the"
246,history of Earth have thought here. 
247,"ROMANA: Newton, of course. "
248,"DOCTOR 4: Oh, definitely Newton. "
249,ROMANA: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. 
250,DOCTOR 4: That's right. 
251,"ROMANA: So, Newton invented punting. "
252,"DOCTOR 4: Oh, yes. There was no limit to Isaac's genius. "
253,ROMANA: Isn't it wonderful how something so primitive can be so 
254,DOCTOR 4: Restful? 
255,"ROMANA: No, simple. You just push in one direction and the boat goes in"
256,"the other. Oh, I do love the spring. All the leaves, the colours. "
257,DOCTOR 4: It's October. 
258,ROMANA: I thought you said we were coming here for May week. 
259,DOCTOR 4: I did. May week's in June. 
260,ROMANA: I'm confused. 
261,DOCTOR 4: So was the Tardis. 
262,"ROMANA: Oh, I do love the autumn. All the leaves, the colours. "
263,"DOCTOR 4: Yes. Well, at least with something as simple as a punt"
264,"nothing can go wrong. No co-ordinates, no dimensional stabilisers,"
265,"nothing. Just the water, the punt, a strong pair of hands and a pole. "
266,(The pole becomes stuck as they go under another bridge. The cone comes
267,down and whisks them both away. 
268,The gloved hand punches frustratedly at its controls as the image
269,refuses to become a model.)
270,
271, [Tardis]
272,
273," (The Doctor sets the Tardis in flight, then falls"
274,backwards into Turlough's arms.) 
275,TEGAN: Oh no! 
276,"(Sarah gets to her bus stop then sees the cone coming, but she cannot"
277,get away. Her model is placed with the Third Doctor's on the pentagon.)
278,
279,TEGAN: Two hearts. 
280,"TURLOUGH: Well, his body's all right. He just seems to be fading away."
281,Why did he have to set the Tardis moving? We were safe before he did
282,that. 
283,TEGAN: Look 
284,(The Doctor starts to fade in and out.) 
285,TEGAN: Doctor? 
286,(The time rotor stops moving.) 
287,TEGAN: What's going on?Â 
288,TURLOUGH: We've landed. 
289,(Turlough turns on the scanner to show the desolate place with the Dark
290,Tower in the distance. 
291,The gloved hand places three figures in the fifth section of the
292,pentagon whilst the fourth flashes on and off.) 
293,"TURLOUGH: According to the instruments, we're nowhere, in no time. "
294,TEGAN: The Doctor must have forgotten to reconnect something. 
295,TURLOUGH: No. The instruments are all working perfectly. They just
296,won't tell us anything. The Tardis is paralysed. 
297,TEGAN: How did we get here? What do we do now? 
298,TURLOUGH: We wait until the Doctor recovers. 
299,TEGAN: And if he doesn't?
300,
301, [Conference room] 
302, (The Lord President of the High Council of Time
303,Lords enters a room where a man and a woman are already seated at a
304,table.) 
305,BORUSA: Well? 
306,CASTELLAN: He has arrived. 
307,BORUSA: Involving this person does not please me. 
308,CASTELLAN: The constitution clearly states that when in emergency
309,"session, the members of the inner council are unanimous "
310,FLAVIA: Which indeed we are 
311,BORUSA: The President of the Council may be overruled. What a
312,"ridiculous clause. Very well, have him enter. "
313,"CASTELLAN: With all due respect, Lord President, your regeneration has"
314,not helped your stubbornness. 
315,(Citadel guards open the doors and the Master enters.) 
316,"MASTER: Lord President, Castellan, Chancellor Flavia. This is a very"
317,"great and, may I say, a most unexpected honour. I may be seated? Now"
318,"then, what can I do for you? "
319,BORUSA: You are one of the most evil and corrupt beings this Time Lord
320,race has ever produced. Your crimes are without number and your
321,"villainy without end. Nevertheless, we are prepared to offer you a full"
322,and free pardon. 
323,MASTER: What makes you think I want your forgiveness? 
324,CASTELLAN: We can offer you an alternative to your renegade existence. 
325,BORUSA: Regeneration. A complete new life cycle. 
326,MASTER: What must I do? 
327,BORUSA: Rescue the Doctor. 
328,MASTER: What?
329,
330, [Metallic corridor]
331,
332, (Thunder crashes outside and lightning reflects
333,off the irregular walls of the zigzagging corridors. The First Doctor
334,is walking through them when he sees a shadow.) 
335,DOCTOR 1: Susan. Surely it's Susan. 
336,"SUSAN: Grandfather. Oh, Grandfather! "
337,(They embrace.) 
338,SUSAN: Thank goodness I've found you. How did we get here? What's
339,happening? 
340,"DOCTOR 1: I wish I knew, my dear. "
341,SUSAN: As soon as I found myself in this horrible place I started
342,looking for you. Somehow I knew I'd find you here. 
343,"DOCTOR 1: Well, the important question now is where are we, and why? "
344,(The shadow of a Dalek appears on another wall.) 
345,SUSAN: (sotto) We must be on Skaro. 
346,"DOCTOR 1: (sotto) We were brought here. Perhaps the Dalek was, too. "
347,(The Dalek comes round the corner.) 
348,"SUSAN: Run, Grandfather! "
349,DALEK: Halt at once. Halt or you will be exterminated. It is the
350,Doctor. The Doctor must be destroyed. Exterminate. Exterminate.
351,Exterminate! 
352,(The Dalek fires its gun at random.)
353,
354, [Conference room]
355,
356, (An image of a pentagonal area surrounded by
357,mountains and with the Dark Tower in the middle is on a large screen.) 
358,BORUSA: The Death Zone. 
359,"MASTER: Ah., the black secret at the heart of your Time Lord paradise. "
360,"CASTELLAN: Recently, the Zone has become reactivated. Somehow, it is"
361,draining energy from the Eye of Harmony. 
362,FLAVIA: To an extent which endangers all Gallifrey. 
363,BORUSA: We must know what is happening there. 
364,MASTER: Did it occur to you to go and look? 
365,BORUSA: Two of the High Council went into the Zone. Neither returned. 
366,MASTER: So you sent for the Doctor? 
367,"CASTELLAN: We looked for the Doctor, but he no longer exists. Not in"
368,any of his regenerations. 
369,BORUSA: The Doctor has been taken out of time. 
370,(An image of the Fourth Doctor and Romana appears on the screen.) 
371,CASTELLAN: We believe the attempt to lift him from his time stream was
372,unsuccessful. There he must stay until we can find and free his other
373,selves. 
374,MASTER: And if you cannot? The cosmos without the Doctor scarcely bares
375,thinking about. What makes you think his other selves are in the Zone? 
376,BORUSA: Their time traces. They converge there. 
377,MASTER: And you can get me into the Zone? 
378,"CASTELLAN: We have a power-boosted, open-ended transmat beam. "
379,MASTER: Ah. Why me? 
380,"BORUSA: Because we need someone determined, experienced, ruthless,"
381,cunning. 
382,MASTER: And disposable? 
383,CASTELLAN: Not at all. You would be useless to us dead. 
384,FLAVIA: Will you go? 
385,BORUSA: Will you? 
386,MASTER: And rescue the Doctor. 
387,(The Master laughs.)
388,
389, [Tardis]
390,
391, (The Doctor has disappeared completely.) 
392,"TEGAN: Come on, Doctor. "
393,TURLOUGH: Hold on! 
394,(The Doctor reappears.) 
395,TEGAN: What's happening to you? 
396,DOCTOR 5: I'm being sucked into a time vortex. Part of me there
397,already. It's pulling the rest. I must send a signal. 
398,TEGAN: What signal? 
399,DOCTOR 5: I must send a signal. Find them. I must be whole.
400,
401, [Metallic corridor]
402,
403, (The First Doctor and Susan are tiring.) 
404,DALEK: Halt at once or you will be exterminated. Halt! Halt! Obey. Obey
405,the Daleks. You will be exterminated. Exterminate! Exterminate! 
406,"SUSAN: Oh, It's a dead end! "
407,DOCTOR 1: That may be precisely what we need. 
408,"SUSAN: No, Grandfather, come on, please! "
409,"DOCTOR 1: No, no, no, don't argue, Susan. Listen to me. Now, when I say"
410,"now, help me to push the Dalek down that alley, and when I say drop,"
411,drop. Understood? 
412,(They hide behind a jutting section of wall. The Dalek appears.) 
413,"DOCTOR 1: Now, Susan! "
414,(They push the Dalek into the dead end.) 
415,DALEK: Under attack! 
416,DOCTOR 1: Drop! 
417,DALEK: Under attack! 
418,"(The Dalek fires in the three-sided area, causing multiple ricochets of"
419,its energy weapon.) 
420,DALEK: Exterminate! Under attack! Exterminate! Exterminate!
421,Exterminate! 
422,"(Finally a ricochet hits the Dalek, and it blows up. The explosion rips"
423,a hole in the wall to the outside. The mutant Kaled inside the casing
424,"writhes for a few moments, then dies.) "
425,DOCTOR 1: It's very dangerous to fire energy weapons in an enclosed
426,space. 
427,SUSAN: Look! 
428,DOCTOR 1: The Dark Tower. 
429,SUSAN: We're on Gallifrey. 
430,DOCTOR 1: The Death Zone. 
431,SUSAN: Why were we brought here? 
432,"DOCTOR 1: Instinct, my dear, tells me that the answer to that lies in"
433,the Tower.
434,
435,[Death Zone section 2]
436,
437, (A slate quarry.) 
438,"BRIGADIER: Charming spot, Doctor. "
439,"DOCTOR 2: My dear Brigadier, it's no use blaming me. "
440,"BRIGADIER: You attract trouble, Doctor. You always did. Where the devil"
441,are we? 
442,"DOCTOR 2: I'm not sure, but I have some very nasty suspicions. What's"
443,that? 
444,BRIGADIER: Huh? 
445,DOCTOR 2: Over there. 
446,(The Second Doctor points to a silvery figure in the mist.) 
447,BRIGADIER: There's something moving. 
448,"DOCTOR 2: No, get down. "
449,"(They crouch down beside an old wall, where a silver hand reaches"
450,through and grabs the Brigadier's arm. He calls out in pain and the
451,Doctor tries to pull him away in vain.) 
452,"DOCTOR 2: Don't worry, Brigadier. "
453,(The Doctor finds a metal bar and hits the silver hand with it until it
454,lets go.) 
455,DOCTOR 2: Run!
456,
457, [Death Zone section 3]
458,
459, (The Doctor stops Bessie on a track along the side
460,of a hill.) 
461,DOCTOR 3: Now what? 
462,(He hears a scream as Sarah falls off the edge of the road in the mist
463,and rolls down the slope.) 
464,"SARAH: Oh. Oh, K9, why didn't I listen to you? "
465,DOCTOR 3: Hang on a minute. 
466,(The Doctor gets out a coil of rope and ties one end to Bessie's front
467,chassis.) 
468,DOCTOR 3: Catch hold of this. 
469,(He throws the other end down to Sarah then loops it round a convenient
470,boulder while she ties it around her waist. Then he reverses Bessie
471,"slowly, pulling Sarah up the slope.) "
472,"SARAH: Oh, I never thought I'd be so pleased to see anyone. "
473,"DOCTOR 3: I think we should come away from the ledge, don't you? "
474,SARAH: Wait a moment. It's you. 
475,"DOCTOR 3: Of course it's me. Hello, Sarah Jane. "
476,"SARAH: No, no, it's you you. "
477,DOCTOR 3: That's right. 
478,"SARAH: No. No, you changed remember? You became all, er "
479,DOCTOR 3: Teeth and curls? 
480,SARAH: Yes. 
481,"DOCTOR 3: Yes, well, maybe I did, but I haven't yet. "
482,"SARAH: Oh, I see. No, I don't. Never mind. Yes, well, thank you very"
483,"much for rescuing me, Doctor, and now perhaps you'll explain why I'm"
484,here to need rescuing. 
485,"DOCTOR 3: Steady on, Sarah Jane. I'm not exactly here by choice either,"
486,you know. 
487,"SARAH: Then, what are we doing here? "
488,"DOCTOR 3: Well, I'll try and explain. Come on, get in the car. "
489, [Tardis] 
490," (The Doctor stands up, with assistance.) "
491,DOCTOR 5: I've got to. What is it I've got to do? 
492,TEGAN: You said something about a signal. 
493,TURLOUGH: About being whole. 
494,"DOCTOR 5: Ah yes, of course. A recall signal. "
495,"TEGAN: What's the signal for, Doctor? Who's it to? "
496,DOCTOR 5: I must send the signal. They'll hear it. That'll bring them. 
497,"TEGAN: Doctor, tell where the signal control is so we can help you. "
498,"DOCTOR 5: It's, it's "
499,(The Doctor collapses.) 
500, [Death Zone section 5] 
501, (The First Doctor and Susan are walking over
502,scrubby moorland.) 
503,"DOCTOR 1: Oh, it's no good. I shall have to rest. "
504,"SUSAN: Oh, yes, of course, Grandfather. I'll just go and take another"
505,look. 
506,"DOCTOR 1: Yes, yes. "
507,(Susan walks on a little way.) 
508,SUSAN: Look. Come and see. 
509,DOCTOR 1: Hmm? What? Goodness me! The Tardis! 
510,SUSAN: What's it doing here? 
511,DOCTOR 1: I suggest we go and find out.
512,
513, [Tardis]
514,
515, TEGAN: He's only just about conscious. 
516,TURLOUGH: If only he'd managed to send that signal. 
517,(The First Doctor and Susan walk in. Susan closes the doors.) 
518,TEGAN: Who are you? 
519,"DOCTOR 1: More to the point, what are you young people doing inside my"
520,Tardis? 
521,TEGAN: It's his Tardis. 
522,DOCTOR 1: And who might he be? 
523,TURLOUGH: The Doctor. 
524,DOCTOR 1: Hmm? Good grief. 
525,(The Fifth Doctor opens his eyes.) 
526,DOCTOR 5: You're here. You're here. 
527,"DOCTOR 1: Yes, evidently. Now, take it steadily, my boy, and let me"
528,help you up. 
529,DOCTOR 5: I tried to send a recall signal. 
530,"DOCTOR 1: Yes, it doesn't matter. How do you come to be here? "
531,"DOCTOR 5: Well, the Tardis was, er. I don't know. "
532,DOCTOR 1: Never mind that. 
533,SUSAN: Is he really 
534,"DOCTOR 1: Me? Yes. Yes, I'm afraid so. Regeneration? "
535,DOCTOR 5: Fourth. 
536,"DOCTOR 1: Goodness me! So, there are five of me now! Oh, er, this is"
537,Susan. 
538,"DOCTOR 5: Yes, I know. "
539,"DOCTOR 1: And, er, you two are "
540,TURLOUGH: Turlough. 
541,TEGAN: And I'm Tegan Jovanka. Who might you be? 
542,"DOCTOR 1: I might be any number of things, young lady. As it happens, I"
543,"am the Doctor. The original, you might say. "
544,"TEGAN: But you shouldn't be here at the same time, with him, should"
545,you? 
546,DOCTOR 1: Certainly not. 
547,DOCTOR 5: It only happens in the gravest emergencies. 
548,DOCTOR 1: Like now. 
549,"DOCTOR 5: Yes, unfortunately. "
550,"DOCTOR 1: Now look, young lady. Make yourself useful. This young fellow"
551,looks as though he needs some refreshment and I know that Susan and I
552,"do, too. "
553,TEGAN: Hang on a minute. 
554,"DOCTOR 5: Tegan, Tegan, Tegan. Humour him. You know, I sometimes used"
555,to get a little tetchy. Fortunately one mellows with age. Turlough will
556,help. 
557,TURLOUGH: Thank you. 
558,(Tegan and Turlough go into the interior.) 
559,"DOCTOR 1: And now, young fellow, tell me all about it. "
560, [Conference room]
561,
562, FLAVIA: The Seal of the High Council. It may help
563,to convince the Doctors of your good faith. 
564,MASTER: Perhaps. 
565,"CASTELLAN: It's time to go. When you have something to tell us,"
566,activate this. 
567,(The Castellan gives the Master a round device with a small button on
568,it.) 
569,CASTELLAN: We will pick up your signal and transmat you back. 
570,MASTER: Isn't anyone going to wish me luck? 
571,"BORUSA: We wish you success, for all our sakes. "
572,(The Master steps back into the transmat cubicle. The Castellan
573,operates it and the Master disappears.) 
574,"CASTELLAN: And now, we wait. "
575,BORUSA: I would prefer to wait alone. 
576,"(Borusa puts his hand on a harp, which stands near a large painting on"
577,the wall of a Time Lord playing a harp.) 
578, [Death Zone] 
579, (The Master nudges a skeleton with his foot.) 
580,MASTER: One of my predecessors. 
581,(An energy bolt comes out of the sky and hits near him.) 
582,MASTER: Not the most hospitable of environments. 
583, [Death Zone section 2] 
584, (The Dark Tower is visible on the horizon.) 
585,"DOCTOR 2: It's just as I feared. We're on Gallifrey, in the Death Zone."
586,
587,BRIGADIER: You know this place? 
588,"DOCTOR 2: To my shame. Yes, mine, Brigadier, and that of every other"
589,"Time Lord. In the days before Rassilon, my ancestors had tremendous"
590,"powers which they misused disgracefully. They set up this place, the"
591,"Death Zone, and walled it around with an impenetrable force field, and"
592,then they kidnapped other beings and set them down here. 
593,BRIGADIER: But what for? 
594,DOCTOR 2: I'll explain as we go. 
595,BRIGADIER: Where are we going? 
596,"DOCTOR 2: To the Tower. To Rassilon, the greatest single figure in Time"
597,Lord history. 
598,BRIGADIER: Is that where he lives? 
599,"DOCTOR 2: Not exactly, Brigadier. It's his tomb."
600,
601, [Tardis]
602,
603,(Turlough and Tegan have rustled up some exotic
604,"looking food, which they and Susan are now devouring.) "
605,"DOCTOR 1: You're talking nonsense, my boy. We must send the signal as"
606,planned and wait for the others. 
607,"DOCTOR 5: No, there's no time. We must leave immediately. Temporal"
608,instability's already affecting me. 
609,"DOCTOR 1: And without our other selves, we'll be of little use out"
610,there. 
611,"DOCTOR 5: Well, they'll never make it. There is evil at work. "
612,TEGAN: Evil? 
613,DOCTOR 1: We're in the Death Zone on Gallifrey. 
614,TURLOUGH: How can you be so sure? 
615,"DOCTOR 5: Well, the Tomb of Rassilon. Look, can we really afford to"
616,"wait, especially if someone is tapping his power? "
617,"DOCTOR 1: Well, what do you intend to do, young man? "
618,DOCTOR 5: I shall go to the Tower. 
619,DOCTOR 1: But there could be great danger. 
620,DOCTOR 5: Help me set up the computer scanner. We can at least see what
621,is out there.
622,Â 
623,
624, [Death Zone section 3] 
625, (Driving along in Bessie.) 
626,DOCTOR 3: All this was the setting for the games. But old Rassilon put
627,a stop to it in the end. He sealed off the entire Zone and forbade the
628,"use of the Time Scoop, until now. "
629,SARAH: But why don't they just tell us why we're here? 
630,(The Doctor stops Bessie.) 
631,"DOCTOR 3: Because they delight in deviousness, that's why. It amuses"
632,"them, chucking us in the deep end, watching us sink or swim. "
633,SARAH: Why have we stopped? 
634,DOCTOR 3: So I can get my bearings. Ah ha. There it is. 
635,SARAH: What? 
636,DOCTOR 3: The Tomb of Rassilon. That's where we're going. 
637,"SARAH: Look, do you think this is wise, Doctor? I mean, well,"
638,"whatever's in that Tower, it's got enormous powers and, well, what can"
639,we do against it? 
640,"DOCTOR 3: What I've always done, Sarah Jane. Improvise. "
641,"(Further along the road, the Master spots them and waves.) "
642,"MASTER: Doctor, wait! "
643,(The Doctor slams on the brakes.) 
644,SARAH: Who's that? 
645,"DOCTOR 3: I don't know. No, it couldn't be. "
646,(They back up to the Master.) 
647,"DOCTOR 3: Jehosophat, it really is you. Yes, well, I should have known"
648,you'd be behind all this. 
649,"SARAH: Doctor, who is it? "
650,"DOCTOR 3: That's my best enemy. He likes to be known as the Master,"
651,"don't you? My, my, my, but you've changed. Another regeneration? "
652,MASTER: Not exactly. 
653,DOCTOR 3: I take it you are responsible for our being in the Death
654,Zone? 
655,"MASTER: For once, I'm innocent, here at the High Council's request to"
656,"help you, and your other selves. "
657,DOCTOR 3: You? Sent here by the Time Lords to help me? I've never heard
658,such arrant nonsense. 
659,MASTER: I happen to be telling the truth. I carry the Seal of the High
660,Council. 
661,"DOCTOR 3: Yes, forged, no doubt. "
662,MASTER: See for yourself. 
663,(The Doctor examines the Seal.) 
664,"DOCTOR 3: Stolen, then. I'll return it at the first opportunity. "
665,"MASTER: If you would only listen, I'm here to help. "
666,DOCTOR 3: You? Help me? Rubbish. This is some kind of a trap. 
667,"MASTER: I knew this was going to be difficult, but I didn't realise"
668,that even you would be so stupid as to make it impossible. 
669,(The Master moves just as another energy bolt hits the ground.) 
670,"DOCTOR 3: I knew it, a trap. "
671,MASTER: These thunderbolts are everywhere. 
672,"SARAH: No, we can't leave him. "
673,DOCTOR 3: You just watch me. 
674,(The Doctor drives off and a bolt hits the road in front of them. The
675,Master runs for his life with explosions at his heels.)

678,
679, (A diagram of the Dark Tower is drawn on a console
680,monitor.) 
681,"DOCTOR 5: Now, as far as I can make out, there are three entrances. One"
682,"above, one below, and the main door here. "
683,DOCTOR 1: Which do you plan to use? 
684,"DOCTOR 5: Er, well, the main door. "
685,DOCTOR 1: I still think you should wait. 
686,DOCTOR 5: There may be very little time. 
687,
688, [Death Zone section 3]
689,
690, (The Third Doctor and Sarah walk away from the
691,smoking remains of Bessie.) 
692,DOCTOR 3: You see what I mean? A trap.
693,
694, [Conference room]
695,
696, (The wavy image of the Fourth Doctor is being
697,worked on.) 
698,BORUSA: Is there nothing you can do to retrieve him? 
699,"TECHNICIAN: Nothing, my Lord President. With the present energy drain,"
700,it is beyond our resources. 
701,BORUSA: You use what spare energy you have to stabilise that portion of
702,the vortex in which he is trapped. It may at least give the remaining
703,Doctors more time. 
704,TECHNICIAN: Lord President. 
705,(The technician leaves and the Castellan enters.) 
706,CASTELLAN: No news from the Master? 
707,BORUSA: Did you really think that there would be?
708,
709, [Death Zone section 2]
710,
711," DOCTOR 2: I wonder, could Rassilon himself have"
712,brought us here? 
713,"BRIGADIER: Hang on a minute, Doctor. You said this chap Rassilon was"
714,dead. You did say that was his tomb? 
715,"DOCTOR 2: Oh, it is, but no one really knows how extensive his powers"
716,were. 
717,BRIGADIER: He could still be alive? 
718,DOCTOR 2: Watching us at this very moment. 
719,BRIGADIER: Didn't you say he was supposed to be rather a good type? 
720,"DOCTOR 2: So the official history says, but there are many rumours and"
721,legends to the contrary. Some say his fellow Time Lords rebelled
722,against his cruelty and locked him in the Tower in eternal sleep. 
723,BRIGADIER: And now he's woken up again? 
724,"DOCTOR 2: Well, it would explain a great deal. Oh dear. "
725,BRIGADIER: Hmm? 
726,DOCTOR 2: We could be playing the Game of Rassilon at this very moment.
727,
728,BRIGADIER: Your tone doesn't inspire much confidence. I assume we're
729,not expected to win. 
730,DOCTOR 2: Come on.
731,
732, [Tardis]
733,
734, TURLOUGH: Even if you. Even if you reach this
735,"Tower, what are you going to do? "
736,"DOCTOR 5: Er, release the Tardis. The computer scanner's located the"
737,force field generator. 
738,SUSAN: I'll come with you. 
739,DOCTOR 5: Hmm. 
740,"TEGAN: I'd like to come, too. "
741,DOCTOR 1: No. I think it would be safer if you were to remain here with
742,me. 
743,TEGAN: I'd like to go with him. 
744,"DOCTOR 5: Er, yes, yes, all right. Now, you'll bring the Tardis to the"
745,Tower as soon as I switch off the force field. 
746,DOCTOR 1: Of course. 
747,"DOCTOR 5: Yes, of course. Right, better get started. Time's running"
748,out. 
749,(The door control works first time.) 
750,DOCTOR 5: Eureka.

752,
753, [Death Zone section 3]
754,
755,(The Third Doctor and Sarah are walking up a wooded
756,slope.) 
757,SARAH: I thought we were going to the Tower. 
758,DOCTOR 3: We are. 
759,SARAH: Then why this way? 
760,"DOCTOR 3: Because the mountains are between us and the Tower, Sarah."
761,That's why. 
762,SARAH: Can't you find an easier way? 
763,"DOCTOR 3: No, it'd take far too long. "
764,(They see a Cyberman patrol down below them.) 
765,"DOCTOR 3: So, the Master has used the Time Scoop to bring others as"
766,"well as us here. Come on, let's get out of here."
767,
768, [Tardis]
769,
770, TURLOUGH: Do you think it will take the Doctor
771,long to reach the Tower? 
772,"DOCTOR 1: It depends on what may try to stop him, my boy. Oh, it's not"
773,without reason that it's called the Death Zone. Great heavens. Two more
774,traces. 
775,TURLOUGH: Time Lords? 
776,"DOCTOR 1: Two more Doctors. The scanner is keyed to my, to our brain"
777,"patterns. Well, well, well, so two of them made it. I wonder what"
778,happened to the other.
779,
780, [Base of the Dark Tower]
781,
782, DOCTOR 2: (singing) Who to Rassilon's Tower would
783,"go, must choose below. No, no, no Who unto Rassilon's Tower will go,"
784,"must choose above, between, below. "
785,"BRIGADIER: Are you in pain, Doctor? "
786,"DOCTOR 2: Age has not mellowed you, has it, Brigadier? I was recalling,"
787,"in point of fact, an old nursery rhyme about the Dark Tower. "
788,BRIGADIER: Does it help? 
789,DOCTOR 2: Considerably more than you do. It describes the different
790,ways to enter the Tower. 
791,BRIGADIER: A nursery rhyme? I never heard anything so ridiculous. 
792,"DOCTOR 2: Nevertheless, I propose to put it to the test. "
793,(They have reached a burning beacon. The Doctor takes one of a pair of
794,metal 'torches' and lights it from the fire.) 
795,DOCTOR 2: Come along. In here. 
796,"(They go into a cave entrance, dripping with water.)"
797,
798,[Death Zone section 5]
799,
800, DOCTOR 5: Soon be there. 
801,SUSAN: I'm finding this quite exhilarating. 
802,TEGAN: I wish I were. 
803,MASTER: Doctor. 
804,TEGAN: The Master. 
805,DOCTOR 5: Wait here. 
806,(The Fifth Doctor walks down the slope to the Master.) 
807,"MASTER: I know this is going to be hard to believe, Doctor, but for"
808,once I mean you no harm. 
809,"DOCTOR 5: Like Alice, I try to believe three impossible things before"
810,breakfast. Go on. 
811,MASTER: I've been sent here by the High Council to help you. 
812,(A Cyberman walks around a rocky outcrop a little way away and sees
813,them. He walks back.) 
814,SUSAN: Is this man a friend of the Doctor's? 
815,TEGAN: Anything but. 
816,"SUSAN: Well, they're talking as if they were friends. "
817,TEGAN: That's what worries me. 
818,(The Cyberman reports to his patrol leader.) 
819,CYBERMAN: I have found the ones from the Tardis. 
820,LEADER: Excellent. 
821,CYBERMAN 2: I shall take the patrol and destroy them. 
822,LEADER: No. Capture them alive. They must be interrogated first. 
823,CYBERMAN 2: Leader. 
824,LEADER: We also need the Time Lord to pilot the Tardis. Go. 
825,CYBERMAN 2: (to other Cybermen) Here are your orders. 
826,"(Meanwhile, on the other side of the outcrop.) "
827,"MASTER: Be reasonable, Doctor. "
828,DOCTOR 5: I am. I listened. 
829,(The Master reveals the Tissue Compression Eliminator.) 
830,"MASTER: As you see, I'm armed. I could easily kill you if I wanted to. "
831,"DOCTOR 5: And not humiliate me first? Oh, that isn't your style at all."
832,
833,MASTER: I also have a recall device that'll take me back to the
834,conference room in the heart of the Capitol. 
835,DOCTOR 5: So you say. I would prefer more positive proof of your
836,credentials. 
837,MASTER: One of your other selves took it from me. 
838,DOCTOR 5: Do you expect me to believe the fantastic tale you've just
839,told? 
840,"TEGAN: Doctor, look out! Cybermen! "
841,DOCTOR 5: Go back! 
842,"SUSAN: Well, we can't just leave him. "
843,"TEGAN: We can't help him, either. Do as he says. We must warn the"
844,others. 
845,(Tegan runs off.) 
846,DOCTOR 5: After you. 
847,(The Master runs with the Doctor at his heels.) 
848,"CYBERMAN 2: Halt! Halt, or you will be destroyed. "
849,(The energy bolt lands ahead of the pair of Time Lords. The Master is
850,knocked out by a flying fragment of rock.)

861,CYBERMAN 2: You will accompany us. 
862,CASTELLAN : Transference now. 
863,"DOCTOR 5: Sorry, must dash. "
864,(The Doctor presses the button and vanishes.) 
865,"TEGAN: Susan, come on! "
866,(Susan trips over a protruding piece of rock.) 
867,SUSAN: Ow! 
868,TEGAN: Can you walk? 
869,"SUSAN: Ow, just about. "
870, [Conference room]
871,
872,(The Inner Council are gathered when the transmat
873,delivers the Fifth Doctor.)

878, (The Master wakes.) 
879,CYBERMAN 2: This is not the Doctor. 
880,LEADER: Take him. 
881,MASTER: Oof. I've been looking for you. 
882,LEADER: Kill him! 
883,MASTER: I'm here as your friend. 
884,LEADER: Who are you? 
885,"MASTER: I am the Master, and your loyal servant."
886,
887, [Tardis] 
888, (Tegan is bandaging Susan's ankle while the First
889,Doctor is updated on events.) 
890,DOCTOR 2: And then? 
891,SUSAN: Then he just disappeared. 
892,DOCTOR 1: Hmm. 
893,TURLOUGH: What could have happened? 
894,"DOCTOR 1: Well, from the way Susan described it, a transmat device. "
895,"TEGAN: Yes, but he must have got it from the Master. "
896,SUSAN: I do hope he's all right. 
897,"DOCTOR 1: Well, with our young friend gone, I shall have to go to the"
898,Dark Tower. 
899,TEGAN: I'll come with you. 
900,"DOCTOR 1: Oh. Oh, well, if you must. Thank you, my dear."
901,
902, [Conference room]
903,
904, DOCTOR 5: It seems I've done the Master an
905,injustice. 
906,"BORUSA: If he survived, I'm sure he will learn to live with the"
907,misjudgment. 
908,"DOCTOR 5: Well, this changes things. If the Master isn't responsible,"
909,then who is misusing the Death Zone? 
910,CASTELLAN: We were hoping you could tell us. You have been there. 
911,DOCTOR 5: Who has control of the Time Scoop? 
912,BORUSA: No one. Its use is prohibited. 
913,DOCTOR 5: But the machinery still exists. 
914,"BORUSA: Doctor, you seem to be implying that the Time Scoop was used to"
915,bring you. 
916,"DOCTOR 5: Yes, I am rather. "
917,FLAVIA: Then you accuse a Time Lord. 
918,"DOCTOR 5: I think it would be quite an important one, as well. "
919,"BORUSA: You have evidence, of course. "
920,"DOCTOR 5: No. No, not yet. "
921,BORUSA: Then upon what do you base this outrageous accusation? 
922,DOCTOR 5: Cybermen. Whoever brought me and my other selves here also
923,"brought them. Now, you know our legends well enough. Even in our most"
924,corrupt period our ancestors never allowed the Cybermen to play the
925,"game. Like the Daleks, they play too well. "
926,CASTELLAN: Hardly proof of a traitor. 
927,"DOCTOR 5: Then there's this. You know, the Death Zone is a large place,"
928,and yet the Cybermen found us very quickly. Almost as if they were
929,supposed to. 
930,BORUSA: They are highly skilled in such things. 
931,DOCTOR 5: Especially when helped. This is the one thing the Master
932,would be sure to keep on him at all times. The recall device. And
933,within. 
934,(The Doctor takes the top off to reveal a flashing light.) 
935,DOCTOR 5: A homing beacon. 
936,(He throws it to the Castellan.) 
937,"BORUSA: Which you gave him, Castellan. "
938,CASTELLAN: It's a lie. The Doctor wants revenge. 
939,BORUSA: Sit down. 
940,CASTELLAN: I will not submit to such wild accusations. 
941,BORUSA: Commander! 
942,(The Guard Commander enters.) 
943,COMMANDER: Lord President? 
944,BORUSA: Institute an immediate and rigorous search of the Castellan's
945,office and living quarters.

949, LEADER: I do not believe your lies.Â 
950,MASTER: What I have said is the truth. We've all been sent here for the
951,same reason. 
952,CYBERMAN 2: To fight? 
953,MASTER: To destroy each other for the amusement of the Time Lords. But
954,"you don't have to play their game. You can defeat them, gain your"
955,"revenge, but only with my help. "
956,LEADER: Explain.Â 
957,"MASTER: Close by there's a Tower, the fortress of your enemies the Time"
958,"Lords. It's well defended, but I can help you break in. "
959,"CYBERMAN 2: And, what do you ask in return? "
960,MASTER: My life. My freedom. A chance to share in your revenge. To
961,destroy the Time Lords. 
962,LEADER: Guard him. 
963,CYBERMAN: Leader. 
964,(The Cyber Leader and his Lieutenant move away to confer.) 
965,LEADER: We will allow him to guide us to this Tower. 
966,CYBERMAN 2: He is an alien. Aliens are not to be trusted. 
967,LEADER: It is not necessary to trust him. 
968,CYBERMAN 2: Will you give him his freedom? 
969,LEADER: Promises to aliens have no validity. When the Tower is in our
970,"hands, he will be destroyed. "
971,(They return to the Master.) 
972,LEADER: You will guide us to this Tower.

976, SUSAN: They're moving so slowly. 
977,TURLOUGH: Don't worry. Tegan will look after the old man. 
978,SUSAN: If only we could make contact with the other Doctors. 
979,(Something thumps the Tardis.) 
980,SUSAN: What's that?

990,"BRIGADIER: Damn it, Doctor, I'm just not built for this kind of thing"
991,any more. 
992,"DOCTOR 2: You never were. Cheer up, we're getting along very nicely. "
993,BRIGADIER: Yeah. 
994,DOCTOR: 2: We should be at the Tower very soon. The tunnel's rising all
995,the time. 
996,BRIGADIER: Is that supposed to cheer me up? 
997,(Something roars nearby.) 
998,BRIGADIER: What was that? 
999,"DOCTOR 2: It sounded like something very large and very fierce, and"
1000,probably very hungry. Come on.

1008,(He points up to a ledge.) 
1009,SARAH: I can't go along there. I get vertigo. 
1010,"DOCTOR 3: Yes, well, I'll help you. Anyway, we can't go back. "
1011,SARAH: Why not? You've shaken the Cybermen off. 
1012,"DOCTOR 3: They don't get tired, that's why not. And they never give up."
1013,
1014,"SARAH: Oh, no, no. I remember. Okay, well, let's go then. And if I"
1015,"don't fall off that path, I'll probably die of fright. "
1016,(Sarah stalks off and something goes Zing!) 
1017,DOCTOR 3: Wait! 
1018,SARAH: What? What is it? 
1019,(A silver android is crouching in front of a cave entrance.) 
1020,DOCTOR 3: Look. A Raston Warrior robot. The most perfect killing
1021,machine ever devised. 
1022,SARAH: It isn't armed. 
1023,(The Robot fires a javelin from its arm right between their feet.) 
1024,"DOCTOR 3: Quick, over there. "
1025,(They take cover behind an outcrop.) 
1026,"DOCTOR 3: Their armaments are built in, and sensors detect movement."
1027,Any movement. 
1028,SARAH: Anything else I shouldn't know? 
1029,DOCTOR 3: Yes. They move like lightning. (The Robot leaps and vanishes
1030,from sight. They stand up and it lands nearby then jumps back to the
1031,cave entrance.) 
1032,SARAH: What's it doing? 
1033,DOCTOR 3: Playing with us. 
1034,(The Robot jumps again.) 
1035,"DOCTOR: 3: Right, come on. "
1036,"(They make it to another boulder, then the Robot arrives. Meanwhile,"
1037,Cybermen are making their way through the area.)

1045,"SUSAN: Yes, but we're still trapped by the forcefield from the Tower."

1059,BORUSA: Where was this found? 
1060,COMMANDER: In the Castellan's room. 
1061,(Borusa raises the casket' lid to reveal scrolls inside.) 
1062,FLAVIA: Black Scrolls of Rassilon! 
1063,DOCTOR 5: Interesting. I thought they were out of print. 
1064,"BORUSA: Don't touch, Doctor. This is forbidden knowledge from the Dark"
1065,Tower. 
1066,(The scrolls burst into flames so Borusa closes the casket.) 
1067,BORUSA: You were taking no chances. 
1068,CASTELLAN: I am innocent. I have never seen that casket before. 
1069,"BORUSA: Take him to Security and discover the truth. Commander, you are"
1070,authorised to use the mind probe. 
1071,"CASTELLAN: What? No, not the mind probe. "
1072,(The guards hustle the Castellan out of the room.) 
1073,DOCTOR 5: Let me speak to him. 
1074,"BORUSA: No, Doctor. The mind probe will give us all the answers we"

1081,Commander has his weapon drawn.) 
1082,DOCTOR 5: Was that really necessary? 
1083,"COMMANDER: Well, as you can see, he was armed and trying to escape. "
1084,DOCTOR 5: It seems you have been saved the embarrassment of a trial. 
1085,"BORUSA: And you have found your traitor, Doctor. Let us at least hope"
1086,it will simplify the task of your other selves. 
1087,"DOCTOR 5: Yes. Yes, I, I should be getting back to them. "
1088, [Conference room] 
1089," BORUSA: Doctor, I admire your courage, but I"
1090,cannot allow you to return. It will take some time to establish the
1091,Castellan's role in this affair. I need your help and advice. 
1092,DOCTOR 5: I can't abandon them. 
1093,"BORUSA: Oh, I'm sure your other selves will be able to cope. "
1094,DOCTOR 5: Are they all in the Zone? 
1095,"BORUSA: Yes, all but one, and he is trapped in the Vortex. Doctor, I'm"
1096,"sorry, but I must insist that you remain. Chancellor Flavia, would you"
1097,escort the Doctor to a place of rest? I'm sure he must be exhausted.

1106,the tunnel wall.) 
1107,"DOCTOR 2: Oh! In here. Oh, oh! "
1108,"(They squeeze through. The owner of the clawed hand is too big, and"

1112,BRIGADIER: Trapped.Â 
1113,DOCTOR 2: Hold this. Must be something. 
1114,"(The Second Doctor goes through his pockets, dropping a catapult and an"
1115,apple.) 
1116,"BRIGADIER: Hurry up, Doctor. It's trying to dig us out! "

1118,DOCTOR 2: Ah! 
1119,(The Doctor untwists the touch paper of a firework and lights it from
1120,"the torch. The Roman Candle goes off, showering sparks at the creature,"
1121,who retreats rapidly.) 
1122,BRIGADIER: What was that? 
1123,(The Doctor has his fingers in his ears.) 
1124,DOCTOR 2: Pardon? 
1125,BRIGADIER: What was that? 
1126,DOCTOR 2: It's a Galactic Glitter. 
1127,(Bang!) 
1128,DOCTOR 2: It's a Yeti! 
1129,BRIGADIER: Where did it come from? 
1130,DOCTOR 2: It must have been left over from the Games. 
1131,BRIGADIER: You maddened it! 
1132,"(The Yeti causes a rockfall, blocking them in.) "
1133,"DOCTOR 2: Well, at least it can't get at us. "
1134,"BRIGADIER: Yes, and now we're trapped. Buried alive. "
1135,"DOCTOR 2: Yes, I'm afraid we are. On the other hand, where there's a"
1136,"wind, there's a way. "
1137,(The Doctor takes back the torch and follows the breeze to a small
1138,stone-framed door set in the rock face.) 
1139,"DOCTOR 2: Well, I think we've arrived. "
1140,(The door creaks open at his touch.) 
1141,DOCTOR 2: I don't like this at all. Someone or something wants us to go

1163,(The Raston robot fires a lance straight through the Cyberman's chest

1171,Cyberman watches them.)

1173,"least we'll have something to have a fight with. Wait a minute, these"
1174,might come in handy. 
1175,(He takes the javelins and some coils of thick wire.)

1186,and down steps by a water feature.) 
1187,"FLAVIA: You look so worried, Doctor. Your friends and your other selves"
1188,"will be safe, I am sure. "
1189,DOCTOR 5: At the moment I'm more concerned for the High Council. For
1190,Gallifrey. 
1191,FLAVIA: The traitor has been found. 
1192,"DOCTOR 5: Has he? You know, I've known the Castellan too long. Oh, he"
1193,"was limited, a little narrow, but always fiercely loyal to his oath of"
1194,"office. Any mention of the Dark days filled him with horror. Now, you"
1195,saw his reaction to the Black Scrolls. It wasn't that of a man
1196,"discovered, but of sheer disbelief. No, I'm convinced the traitor is"
1197,still at large. 
1198,FLAVIA: I will speak to the Commander who killed the Castellan. There
1199,may be much to be learned from him. 
1200,DOCTOR 5: Thank you. And I must speak to the Lord President.

1206,"SARAH: Yeah, right. "
1207,(The Doctor finishes fastening one wire around a boulder. Sarah throws
1208,a rock down the slope at the Cybermen.)

1210,"DOCTOR 3: Right, that should do it. "
1211,SARAH: You're crazy. That'll never work. 
1212,"DOCTOR 3: Well, maybe not. Can you think of a better suggestion? No?"
1213,"All right then, stand well back. "
1214,"(The Third Doctor has tied the other end of the wire into a lasso, and"

1227,SARAH: Yes. 
1228,"DOCTOR 3: Right. Now, let go this hand "
1229,SARAH: I can't. 
1230,DOCTOR 3: Hold both loops in one hand. Both loops in one hand. I've got
1231,"the other one. Right, come on. That's it. Now, find another foot hold."
1232,I've got you. Put it on that ledge. Can you find that ledge? 
1233,"SARAH: Yes, yes. "
1234,"DOCTOR 3: Good. All right, up you come. Up you come. "
1235,"(Before he can pull her over the parapet, Sarah looks down and"

1242,(Sarah is safely on the Tower.) 
1243,DOCTOR 3: Well done. Enjoy the flight? 
1244,"SARAH: Oh, great! Well, we're here. How do you reckon we get in? "
1245,(The Third Doctor opens a small door set at an angle.)

1247, [Dark Tower main entrance] 
1248, (Tegan and the First Doctor are in front of a very
1249,large door. There is a lot of thunder and lightning going on.) 
1250,"TEGAN: Now what? You're not suggesting we bang down the door, I hope. "
1251,DOCTOR 1: It looks very much like a bell to me. 
1252,(The Doctor tips open a bell on a pole to reveal a number pad. He taps
1253,something in and the door slides up slowly.)

1265, DOCTOR 1: Don't be in such a hurry. 
1266,(He takes out some coins.) 
1267,TEGAN: We have to pay to get in? 
1268,DOCTOR 1: It could cost you your life. 
1269,(He throws a square coin onto one of the red and white alternate floor
1270,"tiles, then another, a third and a fourth.) "
1271,TEGAN: How long do you plan to play pitch and toss? 
1272,"DOCTOR 1: Patience, child. "
1273,(A fifth coin on a red tile sets lightning playing all across the
1274,board.) 
1275,DOCTOR 1: Diabolical ingenuity! Nothing happens until you reach the
1276,"fifth row, half way, and then the entire board becomes a death trap. "
1277,MASTER: Our ancestors had such a wonderful sense of humour. 
1278,"DOCTOR 1: Do I know you, young man? "
1279,"MASTER: Believe it or not, we were at the Academy together. "
1280,TEGAN: What do you want? 
1281,MASTER: To help. 
1282,TEGAN: That's the funniest thing I've heard all day. 
1283,"MASTER: Believe what you like, I should advise you to hide. I've got"
1284,very suspicious allies close behind me. 
1285,TEGAN: Allies? 
1286,(The Cybermen come round the corner.) 
1287,TEGAN: Come on! 
1288,(She drags the First Doctor out of sight.) 
1289,"MASTER: Enter, but be careful. The fortress of the Time Lords is at"
1290,your mercy. 
1291,CYBERMAN: Why was the main gate left unguarded? 
1292,"MASTER: Oh, the Time Lords believe that no one could survive the Death"
1293,Zone. It's that sort of woolly thinking that'll bring about their
1294,destruction. 
1295,(The Cyber Leader stops at the chequered tiles.) 
1296,MASTER: Do you fear an empty room? Shall I lead the way? 
1297,(The Master walks to the sixth row.) 
1298,LEADER: You will cross to the far side. 
1299,MASTER: Very well. 
1300,(And does so. Nothing happens. The First Doctor and Tegan look at each
1301,"other, puzzled.) "
1302,MASTER: You see? 
1303,(The Master returns down the right hand side.) 
1304,LEADER: Take the patrol across. 
1305,"(The Cyber Leader stands by the Master as the Cybermen start to cross,"
1306,carefully. They all get zapped to death. One manages to crawls back so
1307,the Master can take his weapon.) 
1308,LEADER: You have betrayed us. Why? 
1309,"MASTER: Betrayed? No. Oh, I, I might have misled you a little, but the"
1310,safe path across the board changes with every journey. 
1311,"LEADER: You show me the safe route, or I shall destroy you. "
1312,"(The Master bows, and steps white, red, white like a chess knight"
1313,moves. The Cyber Leader starts to follow and the Master turns and fires
1314,on him. The Master laughs as Tegan and the First Doctor come out of
1315,hiding.) 
1316,TEGAN: Wasn't that a little ruthless even for you? 
1317,"MASTER: In one of the many wars on your miserable little planet, they"
1318,used to drive sheep across minefields. The principle's the same. 
1319,TEGAN: Not quite. This minefield is still just as dangerous. 
1320,MASTER: Do you think so? 
1321,(The Master does his zigzag steps to the other side.) 
1322,"MASTER: Try it, Doctor, it's as easy as pie. "
1323,(The Master leaves.) 
1324,DOCTOR 1: What an extraordinary fellow. As easy as pie? As easy as pie?
1325,
1326,TEGAN: That's what he said. 
1327,"DOCTOR 1: No, he didn't! He said easy as pi. The Greek letter pi."
1328,"Surely you know some basic mathematics, child? "
1329,TEGAN: Of course. The ratio of the circumference of a circle to its
1330,"diameter is represented by the Greek letter pi, right? "
1331,DOCTOR 1: Exactly. You find the safe path by using the mathematical
1332,"formula pi. Oh, but the application, the application. Now, let me see,"
1333,"now. Three point one four one five nine two six five. Yes, that's it!"
1334,"You stay there, child. "
1335,(The Doctor crosses the board.) 
1336,DOCTOR 1: Now! 
1337,(The Doctor uses his cane to point out where Tegan should step.) 
1338,TEGAN: I hope you've got your sums right.

1343,"DOCTOR 5: President Borusa, I. I thought you said the Lord President"
1344,was in here. 
1345,GUARD: He is. Or at least he was. 
1346,"DOCTOR 5: You're sure about that, are you? "
1347,GUARD: Positive. There isn't any way he could have left without my
1348,seeing him. 
1349,(The Doctor checks the transmat cubicle.) 
1350,DOCTOR 5: No power. He couldn't have left that way. Inform Chancellor
1351,"Flavia that the Lord President has disappeared, would you? "
1352,GUARD: Sir. 
1353,(The guard leaves. The Fifth Doctor starts looking for hidden panels in

1358, (The Third Doctor and Sarah Jane are walking
1359,down.) 
1360,SARAH: I can't go on. I feel as if something were pushing me back. 
1361,"DOCTOR 3: Yes. Yes, I can feel it too, Sarah. It's the mind of"
1362,"Rassilon. We must be nearing the tomb. Now, you've got to fight it. You"
1363,must keep your mind under control. 
1364,SARAH: I can't. I feel as if something absolutely terrible were going
1365,to happen. 
1366,DOCTOR 3: Sit down here. Sit down. Rest for a moment. All right? 
1367,SARAH: Where are you going? 
1368,DOCTOR 3: I won't be a second. 
1369,"SARAH: Well, don't be too long."
1370,
1371, [Dark Tower corridor]
1372,
1373," (The Third Doctor walks along to a corner, then"
1374,turns to go back to Sarah. A man in army uniform walks round the
1375,corner.) 
1376,"YATES: Doctor. Doctor, this way. "
1377,DOCTOR 3: Mike? Mike Yates? How did you get here? 
1378,"YATES: Same way as you. Liz Shaw is here, too. "
1379,DOCTOR 3: Good heavens. 
1380,(Liz comes round the corner.) 
1381,"DOCTOR 3: Hello, Liz. Any more of you? "
1382,LIZ: Someone you should know very well. Come and see for yourself. 
1383,"DOCTOR 3: Huh, not that little fellow in the checked trousers and the"
1384,black frock coat. 
1385,LIZ: And more. There are five of you now. 
1386,"DOCTOR 3: Oh, good grief. "
1387,YATES: And they're waiting for you. 
1388,"DOCTOR 3: Yes, well, you wait here for a moment. I'll go and get Sarah."
1389,
1390,(Yates blocks his way.) 
1391,YATES: I'll fetch her. 
1392,"DOCTOR 3: No, I, er, I think I'll go, Mike. She's nervous enough as it"
1393,is. 
1394,LIZ: Let Mike go. Your other selves need you urgently. 
1395,"DOCTOR 3: No, I think I'll go, thanks. "
1396,(The Doctor dodges round Yates. 
1397,"YATES: No, Doctor! "
1398,LIZ: Stop him! 
1399,"DOCTOR 3: How? You're phantoms, illusions of the mind! "
1400,LIZ: Stop him!!! 
1401,(Liz and Yates disappear in a cloud of black smoke.)
1402,
1403, [Dark Tower staircase]
1404,
1405," SARAH: What's happening? Doctor? Doctor! Oh, there"
1406,you are. 
1407,DOCTOR 3: Sarah? 
1408,"SARAH: Sarah? Of course I am. What are you talking about? Listen, why"
1409,did you leave me for so long? And what was that scream? 
1410,DOCTOR 3: They were just phantoms from the past. 
1411,"SARAH: Yes, well, I'm in the present and I'm real. "
1412,"DOCTOR 3: Yes. Yeah, you're real enough. Come on. (They head off in the"
1413,other direction.)
1414,
1415, [Dark Tower corridor]
1416,
1417," TEGAN: Do you feel weird, Doctor? "
1418,DOCTOR 1: Full of strange fears and mysterious forebodings? 
1419,TEGAN: That's it. 
1420,"DOCTOR 1: No, as a matter of fact, I don't. It's all illusion, child."
1421,"We're close to the domain of Rassilon, whose mind is reaching out to"
1422,"attack us. Just ignore it, as I do. "
1423,TEGAN: How? 
1424,"DOCTOR 1: Fear itself is largely an illusion. And at my age, there's"
1425,"little left to fear. Hmm. No, there's nothing here to harm us. "
1426,(The Master comes down a staircase behind them and follows.)
1427,
1428, [Dark Tower staircase]
1429,
1430,(The Second Doctor and the Brigadier are coming up
1431,some stairs.) 
1432,"BRIGADIER: I don't like it, Doctor. I feel rather unwell. Touch of"
1433,"nausea, I think. "
1434,"DOCTOR: 2: What you feel is fear, Brigadier, projecting from the mind"
1435,of Rassilon. 
1436,BRIGADIER: Fear?
1437,(A woman screams nearby.) 
1438,"WOMAN : Doctor, help me! "
1439,DOCTOR 2: No. It may be a trap. I'll go and see. You wait here. 
1440,BRIGADIER: Certainly not. I'm coming with you. 
1441,"DOCTOR 2: Oh, very well, but don't get in the way. "
1442,(Another scream.)
1443,
1444,[Dark Tower corridor]
1445,
1446, DOCTOR 2: Take this. 
1447,(He gives the torch to the Brigadier. The scream is close by.) 
1448,BRIGADIER: What was that? 
1449,DOCTOR 2: We'll go and see. 
1450,(The Brigadier hooks the torch on a nearby sconce and they walk up to
1451,the corner.) 
1452,BRIGADIER: Good grief! 
1453,DOCTOR 2: Jamie! Zoe! 
1454,"JAMIE: Stay back, Doctor. "
1455,"DOCTOR 2: Why, what's happening? "
1456,ZOE: Don't come any closer. There's a force field. 
1457,DOCTOR 2: A force field? We'll soon see about that. 
1458,"JAMIE: No, don't, Doctor. If the force field is disturbed, it'll"
1459,destroy us. 
1460,ZOE: You must go back. 
1461,"BRIGADIER: Well, Doctor, what are we going to do? "
1462,DOCTOR 2: Get them out of it. 
1463,"JAMIE: No, no, please don't, Doctor. "
1464,"ZOE: Oh, go back. Save yourselves. "
1465,DOCTOR 2: I can't. I can't leave you there. 
1466,ZOE: You must. 
1467,BRIGADIER: We could find another way into the tomb area. 
1468,DOCTOR 2: But Zoe and Jamie would still be trapped. 
1469,JAMIE: The Brigadier's right. 
1470,DOCTOR 2: Or would they? Just a minute. It's a matter of memory. 
1471,ZOE: Stay away! 
1472,DOCTOR 2: Why? I can't harm you. 
1473,JAMIE: One step nearer and we're dead! 
1474,DOCTOR 2: You can't kill illusions. 
1475,(The Second Doctor steps between Jamie and Zoe. Jamie's voice echoes.) 
1476,JAMIE: Brigadier! 
1477,"DOCTOR 2: You're not real. When you were returned to your own people,"
1478,the Time Lords erased your memory of the period you spent with me. So
1479,how do you know who we are? Answer! 
1480,(Zoe and Jamie scream and disappear in a cloud of black smoke.) 
1481,BRIGADIER: They're gone. 
1482,"DOCTOR 2: Yes, yes, it's sad. "
1483,[Dark Tower staircase]
1484,
1485, (They keep going upwards.) 
1486,"BRIGADIER: I still don't like it, Doctor. I don't fully understand why"
1487,we're here. 
1488,DOCTOR 2: You want to get home? 
1489,BRIGADIER: Of course. 
1490,"DOCTOR 2: That is why we are here. Have faith, Brigadier. Have I ever"
1491,led you astray? 
1492,BRIGADIER: On many occasions. 
1493,"DOCTOR 2: Yes, well, this will be the exception. Come along."
1494,
1495, [Conference room]
1496,
1497, (The Fifth Doctor finishes tapping at a keypad on
1498,the conference table then goes over to the portrait on the wall. He
1499,looks at the harp standing nearby and reads its inscription.) 
1500,DOCTOR 5: The Harp of Rassilon. I never knew he was musical. Borusa
1501,either for that matter. 
1502,(He plucks a string and there is a click behind him.) 
1503,DOCTOR 5: Interesting. A musical key. A combination of notes. A tune.
1504,
1505, [Rassilon's tomb] 
1506, (The First Doctor leads Tegan into the vast marble
1507,mausoleum and goes to a carved obelisk nearby while Tegan walks round
1508,the massive sarcophagus with its emblems of Time Lords on the side.
1509,There is one blank space in the four we can see. The Third Doctor
1510,enters from the other side with Sarah.) 
1511,"DOCTOR 1: Ah, there you are at last, dear fellow. What kept you? "
1512,DOCTOR 3: What kept me? Of all the confounded arrogance. 
1513,"DOCTOR 1: Never mind, never mind, you can tell me later. Come and take"
1514,a look at this. 
1515,DOCTOR 3: What is it? 
1516,(They examine the obelisk together. The girls introduce each other.) 
1517,TEGAN: Tegan. 
1518,SARAH: Sarah. 
1519,DOCTOR 3: Hmm. Fascinating. 
1520,DOCTOR 1: What happened to the little fellow? 
1521,"DOCTOR 2: The little fellow is perfectly all right, thank you very"
1522,much. Of course I'm here. You don't imagine anything you two could do
1523,"could stump me, do you? Let's have a look. What's this? "
1524,(He pushes the other two Doctors aside.) 
1525,TEGAN + SARAH: Brigadier? 
1526,"BRIGADIER: Good heavens. It's Miss Smith, isn't it. Miss Jovanka. Don't"
1527,ask me how we got here. It was like a cross between Guy Fawkes and
1528,Hallowe'en. 
1529,"DOCTOR 3: Lethbridge Stewart? Oh, my dear fellow. How very nice to see"
1530,you again. 
1531,"BRIGADIER: Great heavens, you as well? Though I can't exactly say it's"
1532,"nice to be here. Do you know, I was enjoying "
1533,"DOCTOR 3: You'll have to excuse me, old chap. We've got a very"
1534,important inscription to translate and I think they'll get it all wrong
1535,without me. 
1536,BRIGADIER: Typical. Absolutely typical. 
1537,"SARAH: Oh, I know, I know. Drag you through time and space without so"
1538,"much as a bye or leave, then leave you out when things get interesting."
1539,
1540,TEGAN: My version isn't any better. 
1541,SARAH: Which one's yours? 
1542,"DOCTOR 2: So, that's what it's all about. I never dreamed. "
1543,"DOCTOR 1: It changes nothing, absolutely nothing. We lower the"
1544,"forcefield, get the young fellow back from Gallifrey and all go home."
1545,This doesn't concern us. It mustn't. 
1546,TEGAN: What does the inscription say? 
1547,"BRIGADIER: Yes, I'd quite like to know as well. "
1548,"SARAH: Yes, we've all been through a great deal to get here. "
1549,DOCTOR 1: You. Tell them. 
1550,"DOCTOR 2: It's Old High Gallifreyan, the ancient language of the Time"
1551,Lords. Not many people understand it these days. 
1552,"THE DOCTORS: Fortunately, I do. "
1553,"BRIGADIER: All very interesting, I'm sure, Doctors, but what does it"
1554,say? 
1555,"DOCTOR 3: That this is the Tomb of Rassilon, where Rassilon lies in"
1556,eternal sleep. 
1557,DOCTOR 2: It also says that anyone who's got this far has passed many
1558,dangers and shown great courage and determination. What does this bit
1559,mean? 
1560,DOCTOR 3: To lose is to win and he who wins shall lose. 
1561,DOCTOR 2: I know what it says. What does it mean? 
1562,DOCTOR 1: It also promises that whoever takes the ring from Rassilon's
1563,hand and puts it on shall get the reward he seeks. 
1564,SARAH: What reward? 
1565,DOCTOR 1: Immortality. 
1566,"BRIGADIER: What, live forever? Never die? "
1567,"DOCTOR 1: That is what the word means, young man. "
1568,SARAH: But that's impossible. 
1569,DOCTOR 3: Apparently not. 
1570,"DOCTOR 2: It seems Rassilon possesses it now, and is willing to share"
1571,it with whoever takes the ring. 
1572,"MASTER: Thank you, gentlemen, that is exactly what I needed to know. I"
1573,"came here to help you. A little unwillingly, but I came. My services"
1574,"were scorned, my help refused. Now I shall help myself to immortality. "
1575,DOCTOR 1: Out of the question. 
1576,DOCTOR 3: You're hardly a suitable candidate. 
1577,DOCTOR 2: For anything. 
1578,(The Master points his tissue compression eliminator at the Doctors.) 
1579,MASTER: The decision is scarcely yours. Killing you once was never
1580,"enough for me, Doctor. How, how gratifying to do it three times over. "
1581,BRIGADIER: Nice to see you again. 
1582,(The Brigadier has snuck up behind the Master. He turns and takes a
1583,"punch to the chin, knocking him out.)"

1588,up around the Tardis.)

1602, [Conference room]
1603,
1604, (The Fifth Doctor is still plucking the harp
1605,strings.) 
1606,"DOCTOR 5: Well, if it is a tune, what could it be? A tune like, a tune"
1607,like. A tune like the one that's been under my nose all the time
1608,perhaps. 
1609,(He sits at the harp and plays the tune painted on the portrait. The
1610,section of the wall slides away.)
1611,
1612, [Secret room]
1613,
1614, (The Fifth Doctor looks at the pentagon with the
1615,"models on it. Dressed in black and wearing the coronet, Borusa looks up"
1616,from a panel.) 
1617,"BORUSA: Welcome, Doctor. "
1618,DOCTOR 5: Lord President. 
1619,BORUSA: You show very little surprise. Can it be that you suspected me?
1620,
1621,DOCTOR 5: Not at first. Your little charade fooled me for a while. 
1622,"BORUSA: Yes, it was rather neat, wasn't it? Such a pity about the"
1623,"Castellan, but then I needed someone to use for a diversion. "
1624,"DOCTOR 5: Oh, Borusa. What's happened to you? "
1625,"BORUSA: You know how long I have ruled Gallifrey, Doctor, both openly"
1626,or behind the scenes. 
1627,"DOCTOR 5: Oh, you've done great service. It was only right you should"
1628,become President. 
1629,"BORUSA: President? How long before I must retire, my work half done. If"
1630,I could continue 
1631,"DOCTOR 5: Oh, I understand. You want to be President throughout all"
1632,your remaining regenerations. 
1633,"BORUSA: Oh, you underestimate my ambition, Doctor. I shall be President"
1634,"Eternal, and rule forever. "
1635,"DOCTOR 5: Immortality? Oh, that's impossible, even for a Time Lord. "
1636,BORUSA: Rassilon achieved it. Timeless perpetual bodily regeneration.
1637,"True immortality! Rassilon lives, Doctor. He cannot die. He is"
1638,immortal.

1640,
1641, (Tegan and Sarah tie the Master hand and foot
1642,while the Doctors examine a control panel on a wall.) 
1643,"DOCTOR 3: Well, I've reversed the polarity of the neutron flow, so the"
1644,Tardis should be free of the forcefield now. 
1645,DOCTOR 2: I'll try to get through to the Capitol. 
1646,(He presses buttons on a Transmat control panel.)

1659,TURLOUGH: Are we going to the Tower? 
1660,"SUSAN: Must be, we're on preset co-ordinates."
1661,
1662, [Secret room]
1663,
1664," BORUSA: Immortal, Doctor. Before Rassilon was"
1665,"bound, he left clues for his successor, whom he knew would follow him."
1666,"Oh, I have discovered much, Doctor. This Game control room, the casket"
1667,"with the Scrolls, the Coronet of Rassilon. "
1668,DOCTOR 5: But not the final secret. 
1669,"BORUSA: The secret of immortality, Doctor? It lies in the Dark Tower,"
1670,"in the Tomb of Rassilon itself. There are many dangers, many traps. "
1671,"DOCTOR 5: So, you sent me to the Zone to deal with them for you. "
1672,"BORUSA: I gave you companions to help, an old enemy to fight. Well,"
1673,it's a game within a game. 
1674,"DOCTOR 5: Only you botched it, didn't you? One of my selves is trapped"
1675,"in a time vortex, endangering my very existence. "
1676,"BORUSA: Oh, you need have no fear, Doctor. Your temporal stability will"
1677,be maintained. I need you to serve me. 
1678,"DOCTOR 5: Oh, I would not serve you. "
1679,"BORUSA: You have no choice, Doctor. I wear the coronet of Rassilon. "
1680,"DOCTOR 5: And very fetching it is, too. "
1681,BORUSA: It emphasises my will and allows me to control the minds of
1682,"other people. You bow down before me, Doctor. "
1683,"(Against his will, the Fifth Doctor is pushed to his knees.) "
1684,"BORUSA: Come, Doctor. "

1697,"calling the Capitol. This is the Doctor speaking. Well, one of them."
1698,"Can you hear me? Can you hear me, Doctor? Is there anybody there?"
1699,Calling the Capitol. 
1700,"DOCTOR 5: Yes, I'm here. "

1705, DOCTOR 2: We've reached the Tower. We're all safe.
1706,"The barriers are down and the Tardis is here. And I say, we've made the"
1707,most extraordinary discovery. 
1708,DOCTOR 5 : I know what you have discovered. Do not transmit
1709,further. Stay where you are and touch nothing. President Borusa is
1710,arriving to take full charge. 
1711,"DOCTOR 2: Touch nothing, indeed? Who does he think he is. "
1712,DOCTOR 1: He didn't want us to mention the Ring of Rassilon. Natural
1713,enough. 
1714,"DOCTOR 3: Something's wrong, you know. "
1715,DOCTOR 2: You haven't changed. Still finding menace in your own shadow.
1716,
1717,DOCTOR 1: I feel the same. 
1718,"DOCTOR 2: Oh. Well, we shall soon see, won't we. "
1719,(The Fifth Doctor and Borusa arrive in a transmat cubicle on the
1720,opposite side of the Tomb from the panel and intercom.) 
1721,"TEGAN: Doctor, are you all right? "
1722,"BORUSA: Be silent. Be silent, all of you. Do not move or speak until I"
1723,give you leave. 
1724,(The companions stand frozen to the spot.) 
1725,"BORUSA: Gentlemen, I owe you my thanks. You have served the purpose for"
1726,which I brought you here. 
1727,DOCTOR 3: You brought us here? 
1728,DOCTOR 2: He's after the Ring of Rassilon. He wants immortality. 
1729,DOCTOR 3: And you were the one who didn't sense anything was wrong. 
1730,DOCTOR 1: He's a renegade. No better than that villain down there. 
1731,(The Master is now awake but still lying tied up on the floor.) 
1732,"DOCTOR 2: We can't allow it, you know. "
1733,DOCTOR 3: The Tomb was sealed for the best of reasons. 
1734,"DOCTOR 1: And as soon as we're back to our own time streams, it must be"
1735,sealed again. Permanently! 
1736,(The Doctors try to step forward. Borusa raises his staff and they are
1737,stopped.) 
1738,"DOCTOR 2: Doctor, we need you. Join us. "
1739,"DOCTOR 1: He can't. Some kind of mind lock. Fight it, my boy, fight it."
1740,Concentrate. We must be one. 
1741,"(The first three Doctors concentrate, and the Fifth slowly walks over"
1742,to them. Borusa lowers his staff.) 
1743,"DOCTOR 5: You see, Borusa? Together, we're a match for you. "
1744,"BORUSA: Perhaps, but you will never overcome me. "
1745,"DOCTOR 5: We don't need to. Soon, Chancellor Flavia will be here with"
1746,"her guards, or can you overcome the whole High Council? "
1747,BORUSA: Why not? I am Lord President of Gallifrey and you are the
1748,notorious renegades. We shall see who is believed. 
1749,RASSILON : This is the Game of Rassilon. 
1750,(Borusa goes over to the sarcophagus.) 
1751,"DOCTOR 1: No, wait, my boy. That was the voice of Rassilon. It's out of"
1752,our hands now. 
1753,RASSILON : Who comes to disturb Rassilon? 
1754,"BORUSA: I am Borusa, Lord President of Gallifrey. "
1755,(A giant head appears above the sarcophagus.) 
1756,RASSILON: Why have you come here? 
1757,BORUSA: I come to claim that which is promised. 
1758,RASSILON: You seek immortality? 
1759,BORUSA: I do. 
1760,"RASSILON: Be sure. Be very sure. Even now, it is not too late to turn"
1761,back. 
1762,BORUSA: I am sure. 
1763,RASSILON: And these others? 
1764,BORUSA: These are my servants. 
1765,RASSILON: Is this so? 
1766,DOCTOR 3: It most certainly is not. 
1767,DOCTOR 2: Don't believe him. 
1768,DOCTOR 5: It's nonsense. 
1769,"DOCTOR 1: Don't listen to them, Lord Rassilon. President Borusa speaks"
1770,the truth. 
1771,RASSILON: You believe that Borusa deserves the immortality he seeks? 
1772,DOCTOR 1: Indeed I do. 
1773,RASSILON: He shall have it. Take the Ring. 
1774,(Borusa reaches out and removes a large ring from Rassilon's mummified
1775,corpse on the top of the sarcophagus.) 
1776,"RASSILON: You claim immortality, Lord Borusa. You will not turn back? "
1777,BORUSA: Never! 
1778,RASSILON: Then put on the Ring. Others have come to claim immortality
1779,"through the ages. It was given to them, as it shall be given to you. "
1780,"(The faces of the Time Lords on the sarcophagus come to life, eyes"
1781,flickering one way and another.) 
1782,"RASSILON: Your place is prepared, Lord President Borusa. "
1783,(Borusa clutches his head.) 
1784,BORUSA: No! No! 
1785,(The Ring disappears from Borusa's finger and returns to Rassilon.
1786,Borusa vanishes and his face appears in the black portion of the
1787,"sarcophagus. His eyes flicker briefly, then they all return to stone."
1788,The companions can move again.) 
1789,"RASSILON: And what of you, Doctors? Do you claim immortality too? "
1790,"DOCTORS: That's very kind of you. No. No, no thank you! "
1791,"DOCTOR 5: No, my Lord. All we ask is that we be returned to our proper"
1792,place in time and space. 
1793,RASSILON: It shall be done. 
1794,DOCTOR 5: One of us is trapped. 
1795,RASSILON: I know. He too shall be freed. 
1796,(The Fourth Doctor and Romana return to their punt.) 
1797,RASSILON: So shall the one who is bound. His sins will find their
1798,punishment in due time. 
1799,(The Master disappears.) 
1800,RASSILON: It is time for your other selves to depart. Let them make
1801,"their farewells and go. You have chosen wisely, Doctor. Farewell. "
1802,(Rassilon vanishes. The First Doctor chuckles.) 
1803,DOCTOR 5: Did you know what would happen? 
1804,"DOCTOR 1: Hmm? Oh, I'm so sorry. I suddenly realised what the old"
1805,proverb meant. To lose is to win and he who wins shall lose. It was all
1806,part of Rassilon's trap to find out who wanted immortality and put him
1807,"out of the way. He knew very well that immortality was a curse, not a"
1808,blessing. 
1809,"DOCTOR 5: Well, now it seems we must part, just as I was getting to"
1810,know me. 
1811,"DOCTOR 2: So, you're the latest model, hmm? "
1812,"DOCTOR 5: Yes, and the most agreeable. "
1813,DOCTOR 2: Certainly the most impudent. 
1814,"DOCTOR 3: And our dress sense hasn't improved much, has it? "
1815,"DOCTOR 1: Neither our manners. Well, goodbye, my boy. You did quite"
1816,"well, quite well. It's reassuring to know that my future is in safe"
1817,"hands. Come along, Susan. "
1818,"SUSAN: Goodbye, everybody. "
1819,ALL: Goodbye. 
1820,"DOCTOR 2: Time to go, Brigadier. Well, goodbye. "
1821,DOCTOR 5: Goodbye. 
1822,(The First Doctor and Susan enter the Tardis.) 
1823,"DOCTOR 2: Goodbye, fancy pants. "
1824,DOCTOR 3: Scarecrow. 
1825,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, don't you want your coat? "
1826,"DOCTOR 2: Bring it along, would you, Brigadier? "
1827,(The Second Doctor enters the Tardis.) 
1828,"BRIGADIER: Certainly. Goodbye, Doctor. "
1829,DOCTOR 5: Goodbye. 
1830,BRIGADIER: Doctors. 
1831,DOCTOR 3: Brigadier. 
1832,"BRIGADIER: Splendid fellows, all of you. "
1833,(The Brigadier enters the Tardis.) 
1834,"DOCTOR 3: Well, goodbye, my dear chap. I must say, I've had the time of"
1835,"my lives. Haven't we, Sarah Jane? "
1836,"SARAH: Have we? Well, I only have one life and I think I've had too"
1837,"much already. Goodbye. Er, yes, it was really nice meeting you. "
1838,"DOCTOR 3: Thank you, Sarah Jane, it was nice meeting you, too. "
1839,SARAH: What? 
1840,DOCTOR 3: I'll explain later. 
1841,SARAH: Oh. Fine. 
1842,(The Third Doctor and Sarah Jane enter the Tardis.) 
1843,"DOCTOR 5: I'm definitely not the man I was, thank goodness. "
1844,TEGAN: Are we all going home together? 
1845,DOCTOR 5: Watch. 
1846,(The Time Scoop takes the various incarnations of the Doctor away from
1847,"the Tardis, with their companions.) "
1848,DOCTOR 5: Temporal fission. Old Rassilon is very clever. 
1849,"(Chancellor Flavia transmats in with two guards, in full regalia. They"
1850,are followed by two more guards.) 
1851,"FLAVIA: You are safe, Doctor. I feared President Borusa had. Where is"
1852,President Borusa? 
1853,DOCTOR 5: Unavailable. It seems the legend about Rassilon is true. 
1854,FLAVIA: You must make a full statement to the High Council. 
1855,"DOCTOR: Oh, must I? "
1856,FLAVIA: It can form part of your inaugural address. 
1857,DOCTOR 5: My what? 
1858,"FLAVIA: Doctor, you have evaded your responsibilities for far too long."
1859,The disqualification of President Borusa leaves a gap at the very
1860,summit of the Time Lord hierarchy. There is only one who can take this
1861,"place. Yet again, it is my duty and my pleasure to inform you that the"
1862,full Council has exercised its emergency powers to appoint you to the
1863,"position of President, to take office immediately. "
1864,"DOCTOR 5: Oh, no. "
1865,FLAVIA: This is a summons no Time Lord dare refuse. To disobey the will
1866,of the High Council will attract the severest penalties. 
1867,"DOCTOR 5: Very well, Chancellor Flavia. You will return to Gallifrey"
1868,immediately and summon the High Council. You have full deputy powers
1869,until I return. I shall travel in my Tardis. 
1870,"FLAVIA: Oh, but Doctor "
1871,"DOCTOR 5: You will address me by my proper title. I am President, am I"
1872,not? You will obey my commands. (to Tegan and Turlough) Into the
1873,Tardis. (to the guards) You will escort Chancellor Flavia back to her
1874,duties. 
1875,(The Fifth Doctor runs for the Tardis.) 
1876,"FLAVIA: Doctor, wait!"
1877,
1878, [Tardis]
1879,
1880, DOCTOR 5: Hold tight. 
1881,(The Tardis dematerialises.) 
1882,"TEGAN: It'll soon be goodbye, then. "
1883,DOCTOR 5: Will it? 
1884,"TURLOUGH: Well, you're off to Gallifrey to be President. I suppose your"
1885,Time Lord subjects will find a Tardis that really works and get us both
1886,home? 
1887,DOCTOR 5: Who said anything about Gallifrey? 
1888,TURLOUGH: You told Chancellor Flavia 
1889,DOCTOR 5: I told her she had full deputy powers until I returned. 
1890,TEGAN: You're not going back? 
1891,"DOCTOR 5: You know, sometimes, Tegan, you take my breath away. "
1892,"TURLOUGH: Er, won't the Time Lords be very angry? "
1893,DOCTOR 5: Furious. 
1894,TEGAN: You mean you're deliberately choosing to go on the run from your
1895,own people in a rackety old Tardis? 
1896,"DOCTOR 5: Why not? After all, that's how it all started. "
