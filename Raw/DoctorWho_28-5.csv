22,"(A man in a lab coat presses a button, and"
23,backlights a humanoid figure.) 
24,"KENDRICK: The prototype has passed every test, sir. It's working. "
25,LUMIC: I hardly think working is the correct word. 
26,(Lumic moves his electric wheelchair forward.) 
27,LUMIC: That would apply only to machines. 
28,"KENDRICK: I'm sorry. I should say, it's alive. "
29,LUMIC: Can it hear me? 
30,KENDRICK: It might still be in shock. Bear in mind the brain has been
31,welded to the exoskeleton. 
32,LUMIC: Skin of metal and a body that will never age or die. I envy it.
33,Do you know me? Answer. Do you know me? 
34,CYBERMAN: You are John Lumic. 
35,"LUMIC: My child. Mark this day, Doctor Kendrick. We are blessed. "
36,"KENDRICK: Well, it's not quite over yet, sir. We need Geneva's"
37,"approval. Technically, this is a new form of life, and that contravenes"
38,the Bio-convention. They need to ratify this. 
39,LUMIC: And they will refuse me. 
40,"KENDRICK: Nonetheless, we need to tell them. "
41,LUMIC: And if I don't? 
42,"KENDRICK: Well then, I'm sorry, sir, but it's my duty. I shall have to"
43,inform them. 
44,LUMIC: And how will you do that from beyond the grave? 
45,KENDRICK: I don't quite understand. 
46,LUMIC: Kill him. 
47,(The Cyberman puts a gauntlet on Kendrick's shoulder and sends
48,"electricity through his body. Lumic turns away, smiling, and uses the"
49,intercom on his wheelchair.) 
50,LUMIC: Captain? 
51,"CAPTAIN : Yes, sir. "
52,LUMIC: Inform all staff. We have a new destination. Set sail for Great
53,Britain! 
54,[Tardis]
55,
56,DOCTOR: And that weird munchkin lady with the big
57,eyes? Do you remember? the way she looked at you! And then she opens
58,her mouth and fire comes out! 
59,ROSE: I thought I was going to get frazzled! 
60,"DOCTOR: Yeah. One minute she's standing there, and the next minute"
61,roar! 
62,"MICKEY: Yeah. where was that, then? What happened? "
63,"DOCTOR: Oh, it was on this er, this er planet thing. Asteroid. It's a"
64,"long story, you had to be there. Er, what're you doing that for? "
65,MICKEY: Because you told me to. 
66,DOCTOR: When was that? 
67,MICKEY: About half an hour ago 
68,"DOCTOR: Er, you can let go now. "
69,"MICKEY: Well, how long's it been since I could've stopped? "
70,DOCTOR: Ten minutes? Twenty? Twenty nine? 
71,MICKEY: You just forgot me! 
72,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. I was just, I was, I was calibrating. I was just."
73,"No, I know exactly what I'm doing. "
74,(And the time rotor blows up.) 
75,ROSE: What's happened? 
76,DOCTOR: The time vortex is gone. That's impossible. It's just gone.
77,Brace yourself! We're going to crash! 
78,"(The Tardis comes to a sudden stop, and gas masks drop from the"
79,ceiling. The power is off.) 
80,DOCTOR: Everyone all right? Rose? Mickey? 
81,MICKEY: I'm fine. I'm okay. Sorry. Yeah. 
82,DOCTOR: She's dead. The Tardis is dead. 
83,ROSE: You can fix it? 
84,DOCTOR: There's nothing to fix. She's perished. The last Tardis in the
85,universe. Extinct. 
86,"ROSE: We can get help, yeah? "
87,DOCTOR: Where from? 
88,"ROSE: Well, we've landed. We've got to be somewhere. "
89,"DOCTOR: We fell out of the vortex, through the void, into nothingness."
90,We're in some sort of no place. The silent realm. The lost dimension. 
91,(Mickey opens the door.) 
92,MICKEY: Otherwise known as London. 
93,[Lambeth Pier]
94,
95,"MICKEY: London, England, Earth. Hold on. "
96,(Mickey picks up a discarded newspaper.) 
97,"MICKEY: First of February this year not exactly far flung, is it? "
98,DOCTOR: So this is London. 
99,MICKEY: Yep. 
100,DOCTOR: Your city. 
101,MICKEY: That's the one. 
102,DOCTOR: Just as we left it. 
103,MICKEY: Bang on. 
104,DOCTOR: And that includes the Zeppelins? 
105,MICKEY: What the hell? 
106,(Massive airships pass overhead.) 
107,ROSE: That's beautiful. 
108,"MICKEY: Okay, so it's London with a big international Zeppelin"
109,festival. 
110,DOCTOR: This is not your world. 
111,"MICKEY: But if the date's the same, it's parallel, right? Am I right?"
112,Like a parallel Earth where they've got Zeppelins. Am I right? I'm
113,"right, aren't I? "
114,DOCTOR: Must be. 
115,"ROSE: So, a parallel world where "
116,"MICKEY: Oh, come on. You've seen it on films. Like an alternative to"
117,"our world where everything's the same but a little bit different, like,"
118,"I don't know, traffic lights are blue, Tony Blair never got elected. "
119,ROSE: And he's still alive. 
120,"(Rose is staring at an advert for Vitex Lite, cherry flavour, starring"
121,Pete Tyler.) 
122,ROSE: A parallel world and my dad's still alive. 
123,"DOCTOR: Don't look at it, Rose. Don't even think about it. This is not"
124,your world. 
125,ROSE: But he's my dad and 
126,"(She touches the advert, triggering a short film.) "
127,PETE [advert]: Trust me on this. 
128,"ROSE: Well, that's weird. But he's real. "
129,PETE [advert]: Trust me on this. 
130,ROSE: He's a success. He was always planning these daft little schemes.
131,"Health food, drinks and stuff. Everyone said they were useless. But he"
132,did it. 
133,"DOCTOR: Rose, if you've ever trusted me, then listen to me now. Stop"
134,looking at it. Your father's dead. He died when you were six months
135,"old. That is not your Pete. That is a Pete. For all we know, he's got"
136,"his own Jackie, his own Rose. His own daughter who is someone else, but"
137,not you. You can't see him. Not ever. 
138,PETE [advert]: Trust me on this. Trust me on this. Trust me on this.
139,Trust me on this.

141,[The Tyler house]
142,
143,(Luxury Lexus PETE 1 crunches up the gravel
144,driveway of a small mansion. Pete Tyler gets out of the driver's seat
145,"holding a bouquet, and goes inside.) "
146,PETE: Hello? Sweetheart? Only me. 
147,(Jackie comes down the staircase.) 
148,"JACKIE: Oh, the bad penny. Was this your idea? Don't deny it. It's got"
149,"your fingerprints all over it. Trust me on this. Oh, I can trust you"
150,all right. Trust you to cock it up. 
151,PETE: What have I done now? 
152,JACKIE: Have a look. 
153,[Drawing room]
154,
155,(Servants are bustling about. A large banner is
156,hung between two pillars - Happy 40th Birthday.) 
157,PETE: What's wrong with that? 
158,JACKIE: Forty. It says forty. 
159,PETE: You are forty. 
160,"JACKIE: Well, I don't want the whole world telling, do I? "
161,PETE: You're having a party tonight. 
162,JACKIE: My thirty ninth. My official biography says I was born on the
163,"same day as Cuba Gooding Junior, and that makes me thirty nine, thank"
164,you very much. Rose!
165,
166,[Entrance hall]
167,
168,(Jackie calls up the stairs.) 
169,"JACKIE: Come here, Rose! "
170,PETE: These are from the girls in the office. Happy birthday. 
171,"JACKIE: I've got hand sculpted arrangements by Veronica of Reykjavik,"
172,and your secretary stopped off at a garage? I don't think so. And if
173,"you're giving out presents, where's my Zeppelin? Everyone else has got"
174,one. 
175,"JACKIE: Rose? Come on, Rose! Look, you didn't even notice, did you?"
176,Special delivery. Got sent round today. 
177,(Jackie is wearing a very bling bluetooth-like device in each ears.
178,Pete's are quite ordinary by comparison.) 
179,JACKIE: Birthday present from Mister Lumic. Latest modal. Diamond
180,studded. Pick up signals from Venezuela. 
181,PETE: Why would you want to pick up signals from Venezuela? 
182,"JACKIE: Well, I don't know, but now I can find out. For God's sake,"
183,"where is she? Rose? Oh, she needs a good bath before tonight. She's"
184,"going to be honking. Rose, come to mummy! "
185,(A tiny lap dog appears on the stairs. Jackie goes up to it.) 
186,"JACKIE: Come on. There you are, my darling. "
187,(Pete's phone rings. He activates the earpiece.) 
188,PETE: Mister Lumic! Jackie was just saying thank you. 
189,[Lumic's Zeppelin]
190,
191,PETE : That's very kind of you. 
192,(Lumic does not wear his own product.) 
193,LUMIC: Those ear pods are handmade. Tell her to take care. 
194,[Entrance hall]
195,
196,"PETE: Course I will, course I will. I don't suppose"
197,you'd be joining us tonight for the party? We'd be very honoured. 
198,[Lumic's Zeppelin]
199,
200,LUMIC: The world below can party. Some of us have
201,work to do. 
202,[Entrance hall]
203,
204,"LUMIC : My plans have advanced, Peter. The"
205,President has 
206,[Lumic's Zeppelin]
207,
208,LUMIC: Promised a decision. I'm flying in now.
209,We'll be at the airstrip by five o'clock. 
210,PETE : Right. 
211,[Entrance hall]
212,
213,PETE: It's just that I promised I'd help the wife
214,out tonight. 
215,[Lumic's Zeppelin]
216,
217,LUMIC: If the President of Great Britain can make
218,"this meeting, then so can you. "
219,[Entrance hall]
220,
221,"PETE: Oh, I don't know. He's not married to Jackie,"
222,is he. 
223,[Lumic's Zeppelin]
224,
225,"LUMIC: Five o'clock, Mister Tyler. Famous day. "
226,"(The conversation ends. Lumic takes a breath from his oxygen tank, and"
227,talks to his computer screen.) 
228,"LUMIC: Voice print access, John Lumic. Initiate ear pod override."
229,Subject Jacqueline Tyler. 
230,"(Jackie is in her bedroom, sitting at her dressing table and powdering"
231,herself.) 
232,LUMIC: Activate. 
233,(Jackie is powdering her face at her dressing table when her face goes
234,blank. Rods come out of the
235,"ear pods and meet above her head, Cyberman-style.) "
236,"LUMIC : Download Tyler residence, February the first. Give me"
237,"security arrangements for tonight. Passwords, encryptions, services. "
238,(The data is downloaded to Lumic's computer.) 
239,LUMIC: And restore. 
240,(The ear pods return to normal and Jackie carries on with her makeup.) 
241,"LUMIC: Thank you, Misters Tyler. Activate picture link. Mister Crane? "
242,CRANE [on screen]: Mister Lumic? 
243,LUMIC: Events are moving faster than I anticipated. I need extra staff.
244,
245,"CRANE [on screen]: Very good, sir. "
246,[Lorry cab]
247,
248,(Crane is in the passenger seat of an articulated
249,lorry.) 
250,CRANE: I shall go on a recruitment drive. Back her up.
251,
252,[Tardis]
253,
254,DOCTOR: I told you to keep an eye on her. 
255,MICKEY: She's all right. 
256,"DOCTOR: She goes wandering off. Parallel world, it's like a gingerbread"
257,house. All those temptations calling out. 
258,"MICKEY: Oh, so it's just Rose, then? Nothing out there to tempt me? "
259,"DOCTOR: Well, I don't know, I can't worry about everything. If I could"
260,just get this thing to 
261,(The Doctor kicks the console.) 
262,MICKEY: Did that help? 
263,DOCTOR: Yes. 
264,MICKEY: Did that hurt? 
265,DOCTOR: Yes. Ow. 
266,[Embankment]
267,
268,"(Rose sits on a bench and watches the Thames, as"
269,Zeppelin propellers thrum above. There are lots of them. Air traffic
270,"control must be grateful they move so slowly. One passes overhead,"
271,"barely missing the rooftop, then Rose's phone beeps. She has a message"
272,from the Cybus Network - Welcome! Free Trial Period. She gets IE24
273,News.) 
274,NEWSREADER [on phone]: And it's good news for Great Britain as John
275,"Lumic returns to the country of his birth. Mister Lumic, the inventor"
276,"of high content metal, has denied allegations of ill health. "
277,"LUMIC [on phone]: We're all flesh and blood, but the brain is what"
278,makes us human. And my mind is more creative than ever. 
279,NEWSREADER [on phone]: With shares in Cybus Industries doubling in
280,"price, Mister Lumic is "
281,"(The Zeppelin continues to pass overhead, the noise from its rotors"
282,blocking out the newsreader's words.) 
283,"NEWSREADER [on phone]: In other news, the Torchwood Institute published"
284,a study claiming that 
285,[Tardis]
286,
287,DOCTOR: We're not meant to be here. The Tardis
288,"draws it's power from the universe, but it's the wrong universe. It's"
289,like diesel in a petrol engine. 
290,MICKEY: But I've seen it in comics. People go hopping from one
291,alternative world to another. It's easy. 
292,DOCTOR: Not in the real world. It used to be easy. When the Time Lords
293,"kept their eye on everything, you could hop between realities, home in"
294,"time for tea. Then they died, and took it all with them. The walls of"
295,"reality closed, the worlds were sealed. Everything became that bit less"
296,kind. 
297,MICKEY: Then how did we get here? 
298,DOCTOR: I don't know. Accident? Should've been impossible. Now we're
299,trapped. What's that? 
300,(A tiny green light.) 
301,MICKEY: What? 
302,"DOCTOR: That, there. Is that a reflection? It's a light! Is it? Is that"
303,a light? I think that's a light. That's all we need. We've got power!
304,"Mickey, we've got power! Ha! "
305,[Waste ground]
306,
307,"(Opposite the Dome, the International Electromatics"
308,lorry backs in to where homeless people are living.) 
309,CRANE: Gentlemen! Gentlemen! I beg your attention. Christmas has come
310,"early, so come and get it. (The back of the lorry is opened and a"
311,ladder is lowered. Most of the trailer interior is behind plastic
312,sheeting.) 
313,"CRANE: Oh, smell that, comrades. Burgers and chips. Sausage and beans."
314,"Pork, chicken, and hot, sweet tea. All for free. "
315,(A young man runs up behind an older one.) 
316,JAKE: Don't go. 
317,MORRIS: But there's food! 
318,"CRANE: All you can eat, free of charge. Don't just stand there. Fill"
319,your faces with pasties and 
320,JAKE: He's lying. 
321,MORRIS: It's easy for you to say. When did you last starve? 
322,JAKE: All those people disappearing off the streets. It's been going on
323,for months. It's them. They're taking you away. 
324,CRANE: Tomato soup. 
325,MORRIS: What for? 
326,JAKE: Experiments. 
327,"CRANE: But hurry, now. "
328,"MORRIS: No, I'm so hungry. "
329,"CRANE: So come and get it while it's hot. That's it, kind sir. Get in"
330,there and fill your face. 
331,(Morris gets into the lorry. Jake uses a video camera whilst moving
332,behind the old homeless shelters.) 
333,"CRANE: Feast yourself, brother. Feast yourself. "
334,(Screaming starts. The trailer doors are closed.) 
335,CRANE: Take them away. 
336,MORRIS: No! Help! 
337,[Tardis]
338,
339,(The Doctor has got down below the main part of the
340,console.) 
341,DOCTOR: It's alive! 
342,MICKEY: What is it? 
343,DOCTOR: It's nothing. It's tiny. One of those insignificant little
344,"power cells that no one ever bothers about, and it's clinging onto"
345,"life, with one little ounce of reality tucked away inside. "
346,MICKEY: Enough to get us home? 
347,DOCTOR: Not yet. I need to charge it up. 
348,MICKEY: We could go outside and lash it up to the National Grid. 
349,DOCTOR: Wrong sort of energy. It's got to come from our universe. 
350,MICKEY: But we don't have anything. 
351,DOCTOR: There's me. 
352,(The Doctor cradles the green light in his hands and blows on it. It
353,gets brighter.) 
354,DOCTOR: I just gave away ten years of my life. Worth every second. 
355,(Rose uses her free trial to search for Peter Tyler on the Cybus
356,Network.) 
357,MICKEY: It's going out. Is that okay? 
358,"DOCTOR: It's on a recharging cycle. It'll loop round, power back up and"
359,"be ready to take us home in, oo, twenty four hours? "
360,MICKEY: So that gives us twenty four hours on a parallel world? 
361,DOCTOR: Shore leave. As long as we keep our heads down. Easy. No
362,problem. Let's go and tell her. 
363,[Embankment]
364,
365,(The Doctor has the power cell with him.) 
366,DOCTOR: There you are. You all right? No applause. I fixed it. Twenty
367,"four hours, then we're flying back to reality. What is it? "
368,ROSE: My phone connected. There's this Cybus Network. It finds your
369,phone. It gave me Internet access. 
370,"DOCTOR: Rose, whatever it says, this is the wrong world. "
371,ROSE: I don't exist. 
372,DOCTOR: What do you mean? 
373,"ROSE: There's no Rose Tyler. I was never born. There's Pete, my dad,"
374,and Jackie. He still married mum but they never had kids. 
375,DOCTOR: Give me that phone. 
376,"ROSE: They're rich. They've got a house and cars, and everything they"
377,want. But they haven't got me. I've got to see him. 
378,DOCTOR: You can't. 
379,ROSE: I just want to see him. 
380,DOCTOR: I can't let you. 
381,ROSE: You just said twenty four hours! 
382,"DOCTOR: You can't become their daughter, that's not the way it works."
383,"Mickey, tell her. "
384,"MICKEY: Twenty four hours, yeah? "
385,DOCTOR: Where're you going? 
386,"MICKEY: Well, I can do what I want. "
387,ROSE: I've got the address and everything. 
388,"DOCTOR: Stay where you are, both of you. Rose, come back here! Mickey,"
389,come back here right now! 
390,ROSE: I just want to see him. 
391,"MICKEY: Yeah, I've got things to see and all. "
392,DOCTOR: Like what? 
393,"MICKEY: Well, you don't know anything about me, do you? It's always"
394,about Rose. I'm just a spare part. 
395,ROSE: I'm sorry. I've got to go. 
396,"MICKEY: Go on, then. There's no choice, is there? You can only chase"
397,"after one of us. It's never going to be me, is it? "
398,"DOCTOR: Back here, twenty four hours! "
399,(The Doctor runs after Rose.) 
400,MICKEY: Yeah. If I haven't found something better. 
401,
402,[Airstrip]
403,
404,(Lumic's Zeppelin arrives. Pete Tyler is already
405,there. An official Range Rover brings security men and our black
406,President.) 
407,PRESIDENT: Mister Tyler. What's the matter couldn't wait until tonight?
408,
409,PETE: Mister President. Honoured. I'm on the fast track program. Cybus
410,"Industries have bought up my company, so I'm part of the firm now. "
411,PRESIDENT: Some people say they've bought my Government. 
412,PETE: I've never heard anybody say that. Never. You can trust me on
413,this. 
414,"PRESIDENT: I tried your drink, that Vitex stuff. It tastes like pop. "
415,"PETE: Well, it is pop. "
416,PRESIDENT: You made money by selling a health food drink to a sick
417,"world. Not quite the ordinary Joe you appear to be, are you? He does"
418,like to keep us waiting. But tell me. You've had a chance to observe
419,John Lumic more than most. What's your opinion? 
420,"PETE: He's very sharp, I'd say. Sharp as ever. Very clever man."
421,"Brilliant, in fact. "
422,PRESIDENT: Then you don't think he's insane? 
423,"PETE: That's not the word I would've used, no. "
424,PRESIDENT: I see. 
425,(The President goes up into the Zeppelin.)

428,
429,(Mickey walks past a vacant lot and up to an army
430,roadblock.) 
431,MICKEY: Am I all right to get past? 
432,SOLDIER: Yeah. No bother. Curfew doesn't start till ten. 
433,MICKEY: There's a curfew? 
434,"SOLDIER: Course there is. Where you been living, mate? Up there with"
435,the toffs? 
436,(The Zeppelins.)

441,"(Armed soldiers on patrol here, too. The Doctor has"
442,caught up to Rose.) 
443,"ROSE: Mickey's mum just couldn't cope. His dad hung around for a while,"
444,but then he just sort of wandered off. He was brought up by his gran.
445,"She was such a great woman. God, she used to slap him! And then she"
446,died. She tripped and fell down the stairs. It's about five years ago
447,now. I was still in school. 
448,DOCTOR: I never knew. 
449,"ROSE: Well, you never asked. "
450,DOCTOR: You never said. 
451,"ROSE: That's Mickey. I suppose I, we just take him for granted. Do you"
452,"think she's still alive, his gran? "
453,"DOCTOR: Could be. Like I said, parallel world, gingerbread house. We"
454,need to get out of here as fast as we can. 
455,"(There is a beeping sound and everyone stops still, including the"
456,policeman.) 
457,ROSE: What're they all doing? 
458,DOCTOR: They've stopped. 
459,(Everyone's ear pod flashes.) 
460,"DOCTOR: It's the earpieces. Like Bluetooth attachments, but everyone's"
461,connected together. 
462,"ROSE: It's on my phone. It's automatic, look. It's downloading. Is this"
463,"what they're all getting? News, international news, sports, weather. "

505,"RITA ANNE: Well, you get it fixed for me. "

548,yet we allow it to die. But now Cybus Industries has perfected a way of
549,sustaining the brain indefinitely within a cradle of copyrighted

552,the ultimate upgrade. Our greatest step into cyberspace.

554,think we all know what this ultimate upgrade entails. And I'm here to
555,"tell you, John, the answer is no. My government does not give you"
556,permission. And I think no government ever will.

559,"LUMIC: Mister President, if I might make a personal plea. I am dying,"

561,PRESIDENT: I'm aware of that. And I'm very sorry. 
562,"LUMIC: Without this project, you have condemned me. My inventions have"
563,advanced this whole planet. Would you have all that perish?
