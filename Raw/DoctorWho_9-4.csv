21, [Solos]
22,
23, (An old man dressed in rags and with a huge grey
24,"beard is making his way through the scrubby vegetation, half hidden by"
25,the mist. He is out of breath and frightened.) 
26,MARSHAL : Over here! Move in! Path! He's heading to the path! This
27,way! Over here! 
28,"(A slightly portly man in black uniform with silver trim, helmet and"
29,breathing mask is carrying a device which is bleeping. He rips off the
30,mask and shouts.) 
31,"MARSHAL: Mutt! Mutt! Hurry, you men. Hurry! Mutt! "
32,(The mist clears to reveal the old man a little way ahead. The Marshal
33,"gives chase, dropping his mask. One of his men picks it up.) "
34,"STUBBS: Sir! Marshal, your mask! "
35,COTTON: (a dark man) Mutt mad he is. Sport to him. 
36,STUBBS: Kill one before he passes out. 
37,COTTON: Solos. Stinking rotten hole. Can't even breathe. What a planet.
38,
39,"STUBBS: Not long now, soldier. "
40,COTTON: Should have given them independence years ago. 
41,(The old man lies face down by a muddy. There are two rows of
42,protuberances down his spine.) 
43,MARSHAL: Look at it. Disgusting mess. Get rid of it. 
44,STUBBS: Sir. 
45,"MARSHAL: Make out a report. Mutt found dead, as usual. "
46,(The Marshal moves away and Stubbs pulls a communicator from the front
47,of his uniform.) 
48,STUBBS: Stubbs calling Skybase. Returning shortly. ETA forty two zero
49,"six. Have dealt with mutant native alert, area seven. Mutant tracked"
50,and found dead on arrival. Cause unknown.

53,
54, (The Doctor is working on a small electronic
55,module.) 
56,JO: Doctor? 
57,DOCTOR: Mmm? 
58,JO: Are you going to be very much longer? 
59,"DOCTOR: No, nearly finished, Jo. "
60,JO: What are you doing anyway? 
61,DOCTOR: I'm making a minimum inertia superdrive for Bessie. 
62,"JO: Oh. Well, for your information, it's well past lunch time, and I'm "
63,DOCTOR: Eh? 
64,(What looks like a very large chocolate Easter egg materialises on the
65,workbench.) 
66,"DOCTOR: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. "
67,JO: Lunch? 
68,DOCTOR: No. 
69,JO: Bomb? 
70,"DOCTOR: No, nothing so exciting. "
71,JO: Well? 
72,DOCTOR: It's an assignment. 
73,"JO: Well then, it is exciting. "
74,"DOCTOR: No, it's a container of some kind, Jo, from them. "
75,JO: Time Lords? 
76,DOCTOR: That's right. 
77,"JO: Well, aren't you going to open it? "
78,DOCTOR: I'm not allowed to open it. 
79,JO: Huh? 
80,"DOCTOR: I couldn't, even if I wanted to. No, I'm not meant to. I"
81,"couldn't open it, even if I wanted to. No, it's only meant for one"
82,"person, and or creature. It will only open for one person. "
83,JO: And or creature. 
84,"DOCTOR: Yeah, that's right. Yes, I'm just the messenger boy. "
85,"JO: Well, can't you just refuse? "
86,"DOCTOR: They only send these things in a real emergency, Jo. It's top"
87,"priority, a three line whip. No, I've got to go. "
88,JO: How do you know where to deliver it? 
89,(The Tardis roof light flashes and she starts humming with energy. The
90,door opens on its own.) 
91,DOCTOR: I think that has already been decided. 
92,"JO: Hang on, wait for me. I'm coming too. "
93,"DOCTOR: That's out of the question. It's bound to be dangerous,"
94,probably difficult. 
95,JO: All the more reason. You need me to look after you. 
96,"DOCTOR: Sorry, Jo, a lot of rubbish. Not this time. Au revoir! "
97,(The Doctor enters the Tardis.) 
98,"JO: Oh, no you don't! "
99,(Jo runs into the Tardis before the door can close. The Tardis
100,dematerialises.)
101,
102, [Skybase One storage room]
103,
104, (A large spaceship that looks like the front part
105,"of Discovery, the spaceship in 2001, orbits the planet Solos. The"
106,Tardis materialises in a quiet room containing a few white storage
107,"units, and with one large blue oval door in the wall.) "
108,"JO: Well, where are we? "
109,"DOCTOR: It looks like the tradesman's entrance, doesn't it. "
110,JO: What do you mean? 
111,"DOCTOR: I don't see any red carpet, do you? "
112,(Jo looks through a small porthole.) 
113,"JO: Doctor, look. We're flying. "
114,"(They gaze down at the white, cloud covered planet with a few mountain"
115,peaks pushing through.) 
116,"DOCTOR: We're not exactly flying, Jo. We're in planetary orbit. We must"
117,be on a 
118,(A klaxon sounds.) 
119,MAN : Skybase One. This is Skybase One. 
120,DOCTOR: A Skybase. 
121,JO: Amazing. 
122,MAN : Duty personnel to reception and transfer section. Clear
123,visiting party. 
124,DOCTOR: We are expected then. 
125,"MAN : Next, escort them through bacteriological decontamination"
126,hall. Skybase One out. 
127,JO: Bacteria what? 
128,"DOCTOR: Well, put less delicately, Jo, delousing. "
129,JO: Cheek.

131, [Skybase One transfer section]
132,
133, (A man in Mongol-type armour and clothing comes
134,out of a doorway labelled Solonians and is greeted by another of his
135,kind. Another doorway is labelled Overlords. Black uniformed guards
136,stand around.) 
137,VARAN JR: Father. 
138,(The Solonian doorway glows blue and another man in less armour comes
139,out.) 
140,"VARAN: Greetings, Ky. "
141,"KY: I knew you would be here, Varan, with your Overlord masters. "
142,VARAN: And why are you here? 
143,KY: I was summoned. 
144,VARAN: You will attend the conference? 
145,KY: The conference? More lies from the Overlords. More promises of
146,freedom. 
147,VARAN: Yet Ky still came? 
148,KY: I came to demand that the Overlords stop murdering our people. 
149,VARAN: The mutants must be rooted out. They are evil and diseased. 
150,KY: Who tells us that? 
151,VARAN: My eyes tell me. 
152,"KY: No, Varan, the Overlords tell you. They tell you to kill and you"
153,kill. 
154,VARAN: My people are warriors. It is honourable to fight. 
155,KY: Where is the honour in hunting down unarmed creatures? 
156,"VARAN: It is their duty, Ky. They are diseased. "
157,"KY: If it is a disease, what has caused it? Once we were farmers and"
158,"hunters. The land was green, the rivers ran clear, the air was sweet to"
159,"breathe. And then the Overlords came, bringing Earth's poisons with"
160,"them, calling it progress. We toiled in their mines, we became slaves."
161,Worse than slaves! 
162,VARAN: Liar! 
163,"KY: Murderer! You have nothing else to hunt, so you hunt your own kind."
164,
165,(Ky and Varan square up to fight. Varan reaches for his sword and a
166,guard intervenes.) 
167,"STUBBS: So you've arrived, Ky. "
168,"KY: As you see, Overlord. We come when we are called. "
169,"STUBBS: Well, don't just stand there making speeches, get into"
170,decontamination. 
171,(Stubbs indicates an area through a large archway.) 
172,"STUBBS: And the rest of you. Varan, the Marshal wants to see you. "
173,(Varan's bodyguard makes to follow his leader through a second
174,archway.) 
175,STUBBS: Alone. 
176,VARAN: Wait. 
177,(Varan leaves. Stubbs leaves down a corridor past Decontamination. A
178,guard moves over to the bodyguard and grabs his arm. The bodyguard does
179,not have a normal hand.) 
180,GUARD: Mutt! 
181,(The bodyguard knocks out the guard and makes his escape.)

184,
185," DOCTOR: Taking their time, aren't they, Jo? Jo?"
186,"Jo, where? Oh, they you are. "
187,(Jo comes from behind the Tardis.) 
188,JO: Doctor? 
189,DOCTOR: Mmm? 
190,JO: Are you sure we're in the reception area? Looks more like a broom
191,"cupboard. Where exactly are we, time wise? "
192,"DOCTOR: Don't use expressions like that, Jo, please. "
193,"JO: All right, century wise. "
194,"DOCTOR: According to the Tardis's instrument readings, we are now in"
195,the thirtieth century empire. 
196,JO: I see. What empire? 
197,"DOCTOR: Your empire. Earth's empire. Yes, great colonists, Earthmen,"
198,"you know, Jo. Once they'd sacked the solar system, they moved onto"
199,pastures new. Solos is one of them. One of the last. Did you ever read
200,Gibbon's Decline and Fall? 
201,JO: No. Is it good? 
202,"DOCTOR: Jo, this is like that. You see? "
203,JO: No. 
204,"DOCTOR: Oh. Well, empires rise and empires fall. And if this is their"
205,"idea of a reception, this one has obviously crumbled. "
206,(The Doctor goes to the door. On the left is a panel with a hand print
207,on it.) 
208,"DOCTOR: Right, if we're to get out of here, I've obviously got to try"
209,and break the circuit. 
210,(The Doctor takes out his sonic screwdriver.)
211,
212,[Marshal's office]
213,
214, (Varan enters with two guards.) 
215,"MARSHAL: Ah, Varan. "
216,VARAN: Why has Ky been summoned to this conference? 
217,"MARSHAL: Oh, you've seen him then. "
218,"VARAN: He called me murderer. Me, Varan. I should have finished with"
219,him there and then. 
220,"MARSHAL: Oh no, Varan. We want no martyrs. I have other plans for Ky. "
221,VARAN: You said I would represent my people. 
222,MARSHAL: You will be there. You and Ky. Now listen. 
223, [Skybase One storage room]
224,
225, (The sonic screwdriver burns out the lock and the
226,door opens.) 
227,JO: The box. 
228,DOCTOR: What? 
229,JO: The box! 
230,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, of course. "
231,(The Doctor fetches the egg from the Tardis.) 
232,"DOCTOR: Here, you take it. "
233,JO: All right.
234,
235, [Storage area 4]
236,
237, (According to the sign on the wall.) 
238,"DOCTOR: It's all right, there's nobody about. Come on. "
239,(The klaxon sounds.) 
240,MAN : Attention. Attention. Computer confirms door malfunction in
241,storage area four. 
242,JO: That's us. 
243,MAN : Investigation please. 
244,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know. I'm not sure I like being described as a"
245,malfunction.
246,
247, [Storage area 5]
248,
249, (A game of chess is ongoing. The pieces are metal
250,"tubes with decorated tops. Cotton is playing black, or copper"
251,actually.) 
252,COTTON: Check. 
253,MAN : I repeat. Investigation please. 
254,STUBBS: That's us. 
255,COTTON: What is it? 
256,STUBBS: A door. 
257,COTTON: Door? All the way over there for a door? 
258,"STUBBS: Yeah, seems a bit pointless, doesn't it. "
259,"COTTON: Ah, leave it. Leave it till morning. We have only just got back"
260,up here after that Mutt hunt. Tell you what. 
261,STUBBS: What? 
262,COTTON: You won't catch him rushing about tonight. 
263,STUBBS: Who? 
264,COTTON: His Nibs. The Marshal.
265,
266, [Marshal's office]
267,
268," MARSHAL: Understand? I want a man I can trust,"
269,trust absolutely. 
270,VARAN: All my warriors can be trusted. They will fight to the death for
271,Varan. 
272,MARSHAL: Then you will need this pass. 
273,(The Marshal gives Varan a red plastic chip.) 
274,VARAN: It is good. 
275,"MARSHAL: Huh. I doubt if Ky will think so. Varan, I shall want to see"
276,this man of yours myself. 
277,VARAN: Now? 
278,MARSHAL: Afterwards. 
279,(Varan leaves.) 
280,MARSHAL: The fool.
281,
282, [Skybase One corridor]
283,
284, DOCTOR: Hello? Hello? 
285,(They walk into storage area 3 and the Doctor tries a door panel.
286,Nothing happens so he gets out the screwdriver.) 
287,JO: Doctor. 
288,"DOCTOR: Well, we can't wander around here all night with nobody"
289,"noticing, now can we? "
290,"JO: Doctor, look! "
291,(It is the bodyguard. He draws his sword and rushes forward just as the
292,Doctor gets the door open and goes through followed by Jo. The
293,bodyguard's arm is trapped by the closing door.) 
294,MAN : Attention. Attention. 
295, [Storage area 5]
296,
297, MAN : Door malfunction in storage area three.
298,Immediate investigation ordered. Possible emergency. Out. 
299,STUBBS: We should have gone the first time. Come on. 
300,"COTTON: Oh, we couldn't have known. "
301,"STUBBS: Come on! We're in enough trouble already. Two malfunctions, eh?"
302,I don't like the sound of that.
303,
304, [Storage area 3]
305,
306, (The bodyguard's arm is flailing around as the
307,Doctor tries to hold the door shut.) 
308,DOCTOR: I can't hold it much longer. 
309,"JO: Well, what is it? "
310,"DOCTOR: I've no idea but whatever it is, it isn't friendly! "
311,(Stubbs and Cotton enter through another door.) 
312,STUBBS: Away from that door. 
313,"DOCTOR: Look, you fool. "
314,STUBBS: Away from the door! 
315,DOCTOR: Look at his hand! 
316,"(Cotton pushes the Doctor and Jo away. The bodyguard enters, roars and"
317,Stubbs shoots him.) 
318,STUBBS: (into comm.) Stubbs and Cotton investigating malfunction
319,storage area three. Mutant native contacted and destroyed. Two other
320,"non-personnel found and held. Report ends. Good evening, sir. Will you"
321,please come with us to reception? 
322,DOCTOR: I assume I have no choice? 
323,"STUBBS: This way, sir. "
324,"DOCTOR: Mutant native, you said? "
325,"STUBBS: That's right, sir. "
326,(The bodyguard also has the ridges down his spine.)
327,
328, [Marshal's office]
329,
330, MARSHAL: (into comm.) A mutt? On my Skybase? How? 
331,"STUBBS : He was Varan's bodyguard, sir. "
332,MARSHAL: Varan's bodyguard? Get me a full report at once. Hold the
333,"other two, and get Varan. "
334,(The Marshal's communicator is the top of his swagger stick. He shuts
335,it off as a man in a long black coat enters.) 
336,"MARSHAL: I've asked for a full report, Administrator. "
337,ADMINISTRATOR: I should think so. What happened to your security
338,"arrangements? And why wasn't I informed that Varan was here? Really,"
339,"Marshal, on the eve of the independence conference."
340,(Everyone say Hi! to Geoffrey Palmer.) 
341,MARSHAL: They'll be a full security clampdown. The Solonians will never
342,"know. As for Varan, he was merely reporting on Ky's activities. "
343,"ADMINISTRATOR: Spying for you, you mean. "
344,MARSHAL: All part of security. 
345,ADMINISTRATOR: Security? Such as we had tonight? Natives and the devil
346,"knows who else running amok. Good heavens, man, we're not at war with"
347,the Solonians. We're giving them independence. 
348,"MARSHAL: Oh, eventually. "
349,"ADMINISTRATOR: Not eventually, Marshal, now. Total and absolute"
350,independence. We're pulling out. 
351,MARSHAL: Pulling out? 
352,ADMINISTRATOR: I take it you've been too busy with security to study
353,the latest reports from Earth? We can't afford an empire any more.
354,"Earth is exhausted, Marshal. Finished. Politically, economically and"
355,biologically finished. 
356,"MARSHAL: Then why go back? We could keep Skybase on Solos, take over"
357,the whole planet. 
358,ADMINISTRATOR: Out of the question. Apart from the Solonians
359,"themselves, there's the problem of the atmosphere. "
360,"MARSHAL: Well, they're both problems that can be solved. "
361,ADMINISTRATOR: Ky's already making political capital out of your
362,experiments in that field. 
363,MARSHAL: The mutants. 
364,ADMINISTRATOR: Exactly. 
365,MARSHAL: There is no proof that my atmospheric experiments have
366,anything at all to do with these mutations. The Mutts are a menace and
367,must be wiped out. 
368,ADMINISTRATOR: And that's your alternative to independence? Genocide? 
369,"MARSHAL: Give them independence, they'll starve out of total"
370,incompetence. 
371,"ADMINISTRATOR: Nevertheless, they shall have their independence."
372,Whether they're ready for it or not. 
373,"MARSHAL: When you summoned this conference, Administrator, I assumed it"
374,for your usual line. 
375,ADMINISTRATOR: Which is? 
376,"MARSHAL: Fob them off with promises, a few minor concessions. It's"
377,always worked before. 
378,"ADMINISTRATOR: Well, this time I'm conceding all Ky's demands. "
379,MARSHAL: But 
380,ADMINISTRATOR: We have no choice. We must return to Earth. 
381,"MARSHAL: But I've put years of my life into this planet. The whole, my"
382,whole career 
383,"ADMINISTRATOR: Yeah, well, I'm afraid things are going to be a bit"
384,"tricky for ex-colonial officials. Still, don't worry, old chap. We'll"
385,"find you something. The Bureau of Records, perhaps. Something clerical."
386,
387,(The Administrator leaves.) 
388,"MARSHAL: (into comm.) Get me that fool, Varan."
389,
390, [Skybase One room]
391,
392," (Jo is looking through a porthole, and wearing"
393,sunglasses.) 
394,JO: Doctor? 
395,DOCTOR: What? 
396,JO: You can see the planet in daylight now. 
397,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, so you can. "
398,"JO: It's not like our Earth, is it? It's all grey and misty. "
399,"DOCTOR: Well, the Earth these people know now, Jo, in the thirtieth"
400,"century empire, is even more grey and misty. "
401,JO: It can't be! 
402,"DOCTOR: Land and sea alike, all grey. Grey cities linked by grey"
403,highways across grey deserts. 
404,JO: Really? 
405,"DOCTOR: Oh, yeah. Slag, ash, clinker. The fruits of technology, Jo. "
406,(Stubbs steps aside as the door opens and the Administrator enters.) 
407,ADMINISTRATOR: Morning. 
408,DOCTOR: Good morning. 
409,ADMINISTRATOR: I've seen your statements. What is it you want? As
410,briefly as possible. 
411,DOCTOR: We come from Earth. 
412,ADMINISTRATOR: Who sent you? 
413,DOCTOR: Overlord Centre. 
414,"ADMINISTRATOR: The council, you mean? "
415,DOCTOR: Yes. 
416,ADMINISTRATOR: The council has no further interest in Solos. 
417,(The Marshal enters.) 
418,"DOCTOR: Well, they certainly had when we left. "
419,"MARSHAL: Just, er, when did you leave, Doctor? "
420,DOCTOR: Sometime ago now. 
421,MARSHAL: He's lying. He's got no pass. 
422,"DOCTOR: Look, this was an emergency. "
423,"MARSHAL: There have been no shuttles, no departures from Earth, no"
424,arrivals on Skybase in weeks. 
425,"DOCTOR: For goodness sake, does it matter how we got here? "
426,MARSHAL: They must be from Solos. 
427,ADMINISTRATOR: Let him speak. Why are you here? 
428,DOCTOR: This is why. Jo? 
429,(Jo hands the egg to the Doctor who hands it to the Administrator.
430,Nothing happens.) 
431,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, obviously it's not for you. "
432,(The Marshal takes it. Also nothing.) 
433,"DOCTOR: Nor you, it would seem. "
434,"ADMINISTRATOR: Is this some kind of joke? Who is it for? What is it,"
435,anyway? 
436,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a container of some kind, but I must have confess"
437,that I 
438,ADMINISTRATOR: Then open it! 
439,DOCTOR: I can't. 
440,(The Marshal takes Stubbs' weapon.) 
441,MARSHAL: Open it! 
442,"DOCTOR: You're wasting your time, Marshal. This box will only open for"
443,the person to whom it was sent. 
444,MARSHAL: We shall see. Stubbs? 
445,STUBBS: Sir. 
446,(Stubbs places the egg on a display stand.) 
447,MARSHAL: Stand back. 
448,"(The Marshal shoots at the egg, twice. It glows and smokes then returns"
449,to dark brown again.) 
450,DOCTOR: You see? 
451,ADMINISTRATOR: You must know who it's for. 
452,MARSHAL: They were found with the Mutt. They must be saboteurs. 
453,"DOCTOR: Oh, don't be a fool. If we were saboteurs, that'd be a bomb,"
454,and thanks to you we'd all be blown to smithereens by now. 
455,(Cotton enters.) 
456,"COTTON: Sir, the Solonian delegates are ready for you. "
457,ADMINISTRATOR: Thank you. 
458,(Cotton leaves.) 
459,"ADMINISTRATOR: Well, whatever it is, it'll have to wait. Marshal? "
460,MARSHAL: Be with you in a moment. 
461,(The Administrator leaves.) 
462,"MARSHAL: Now, perhaps you'll tell me just what this is really all"
463,about. 
464,JO: But he has! What he told you was the truth. 
465,MARSHAL: What are you? Some sort of special agent for the council sent
466,to check on me? 
467,DOCTOR: If you really want to find out what's in this box 
468,MARSHAL: I shall find out. 
469,DOCTOR: May I suggest that you take it to the conference. It could well
470,be for someone there. 
471,MARSHAL: Could it? I think there are more important things. Far more
472,important things. Stubbs! 
473,STUBBS: Sir? 
474,MARSHAL: Don't let these two out of your sight. 
475,STUBBS: Sir.
476,
477, [Marshal's office]
478,
479,"(The Marshal enters, wearing a silver waistcoat"
480,over his uniform. The Solonians are gathered around a circular smoked
481,glass table. The guards at the door frisk Varan's son. The Marshal goes
482,to Varan and they talk with their backs to the others.) 
483,MARSHAL: Which is he? 
484,VARAN: By the door. 
485,MARSHAL: Does he understand the new instructions? 
486,VARAN: He understands. 
487,MARSHAL: Is he reliable? 
488,VARAN: He is my son. 
489,MARSHAL: Your son? 
490,VARAN: You asked for someone in whom we could trust. 
491,"MARSHAL: Yes. Good, Varan. "
492,"(The Marshal hands Varan a small brown object on a thong, which Varan"
493,puts round his son's neck. The Marshal goes to his desk.) 
494,MAN : His Excellency the Administrator. 
495,(The Administrator enters wearing a very long silver and brown cape
496,over his uniform.)

499,
500," (The Doctor, Jo and Stubbs are watching"
501,proceedings on a crystal ball which is now on the stand.) 
502,MAN : Skybase One. Skybase One. This is an Overlord telecast. 
503,(An anthem plays.) 
504,"DOCTOR: Bombastic signature tune, isn't it? "
505,"STUBBS: Well, it always impresses them on Solos. "
506,DOCTOR: Does it really. 
507,"MAN : His Excellency the Administrator, is about to make his final"
508,statement of terms relating to the question of independence in the
509,presence of the Solonian All Peoples Union. 
510,"DOCTOR: What's your view, Stubbs? "
511,"STUBBS: Independence? Oh yeah, the sooner the better. Let's get off and"
512,home. Plenty to sort out there. 
513,"DOCTOR: Yes, quite so. "
514,(The Doctor gestures Jo to keep Stubbs talking.) 
515,JO: Have you got a family back on Earth? 
516,"STUBBS: Oh, I hope so, Miss. "
517,JO: Do you hear from them very often? 
518,"STUBBS: Oh, I get reports, you know. The odd video. "
519,JO: No letters? 
520,STUBBS: Letters? 
521,JO: Mmm. 
522,STUBBS: What the 
523,(The Doctor sneaks behind Stubbs and uses a pressure point hold to
524,knock him out.) 
525,"DOCTOR: Sorry about that, Stubbs. Well done, Jo, you did that"
526,beautifully. 
527,JO: Pity. He was rather sweet. 
528,DOCTOR: Do you think so? 
529,JO: Mmm. 
530,"DOCTOR: Come on, let's get to that conference. "
531,"JO: Here, you take that."
532,
533, [Marshal's office]
534,
535," ADMINISTRATOR: Some five hundred years ago, we"
536,"Earthmen, Overlords, as you call us, arrived on Solos. Our ancestors,"
537,"yours and mine, made a solemn treaty. A pact, a bond, an act of"
538,friendship 
539,KY: Treachery 
540,ADMINISTRATOR: And mutual co-operation between our two peoples. A bold
541,"concept. Two different cultures, far apart in terms of development "
542,"(The Marshal nods at Varan Junior, who examines the thing hanging round"
543,his neck.) 
544,"ADMINISTRATOR: Uniting together to create a new society, a new and"
545,"richer world. Now, after five hundred years of "
546,KY: Exploitation. 
547,"ADMINISTRATOR: Expert scientific and technical aid, we have steered you"
548,to the verge of 
549,KY: Disaster! 
550,ADMINISTRATOR: To the verge of independence.
551,
552, [Skybase One transfer section]
553,
554, DOCTOR: Segregation. 
555,JO: Hmm.
556,
557, [Marshal's office]
558,
559, ADMINISTRATOR: Rights and privileges as citizens
560,"of empire. You, the peoples of Solos, have given us much. And we in"
561,return have given you 
562,KY: Mutts! 
563,ADMINISTRATOR: A strong and stable system of government. 
564,KY: (sotto) Freedom now! 
565,ADMINISTRATOR: Despite 
566,(Ky whispers to the other Solonians round the table.) 
567,"ADMINISTRATOR: Despite, I say, recent acts of terrorism, violence and"
568,subversion. 
569,SOLONIANS: Freedom. Freedom. Freedom. 
570,ADMINISTRATOR: The only black mark on the history of amicable relations
571,unparalleled throughout the empire! 
572,KY: We want freedom and we want it now!
573,
574, [Outside the Marshal's office]
575,
576,(Cotton is standing guard.) 
577,COTTON: Where do you think you're going? 
578,"DOCTOR: Well, to the conference, of course. "
579,"COTTON: Not without a pass. Sorry, sir. "
580,"DOCTOR: Pass, what pass? "
581,"COTTON: Nobody in without a pass, sir. "
582,"DOCTOR: Look, all this has been arranged by the Administrator. "
583,"COTTON: Sorry, sir. That Mutt. Extra security all over. "
584,"DOCTOR: Look, this thing contains important documents. Details of the"
585,"whole independence agreement, ready for signing. "
586,"COTTON: Open it up, please, sir. "
587,DOCTOR: What? 
588,"COTTON: Can't risk weapons in there, sir."
589,
590, [Marshal's office]
591,
592, (Varan Junior is surreptitiously pointing the
593,"object at the Administrator, or is it at Ky?) "
594,ADMINISTRATOR: Now it is my duty to set out the final conditions that
595,Earth Council has laid down. 
596,"KY: Do you hear that, Varan? Hundreds of years of oppression and"
597,slavery. 
598,"ADMINISTRATOR: Good friends, I beg you to listen. "
599,KY: (Shouts.) You pollute the lands we live by! 
600,ADMINISTRATOR: We have no need to quarrel. 
601,KY: Now you want to take from us the very air we breathe! 
602,"ADMINISTRATOR: Look, Earth government "
603,"MARSHAL: Guards, arrest him! "
604,ADMINISTRATOR: Earth Government is prepared to concede if you will only
605,let me finish! 
606,(The guards grab Ky. There's a whiz bang and the Administrator clutches
607,his jaw.) 
608,KY: Out! Go! 
609,MARSHAL: Stop him! 
610,KY: Get back to Solos! 
611,MARSHAL: Stop him!

614,
615," DOCTOR: No, I can't open it. "
616,"(The door opens and Ky pushes his way between the Doctor and Jo,"
617,touching the egg.) 
618,"KY: Out of my way, Overlord. "
619,"DOCTOR: The box, it's opening! Wait! This is for you! "
620,"JO: I'll get him, Doctor. "
621,DOCTOR: Wait! 
622,MARSHAL: After him! After him! He must be stopped! 
623,(The chase is on.)
624,
625, [Skybase One transfer section]
626,
627, JO: Wait! Listen! I've got to talk to you! Listen!
628,
629,(Ky grabs Jo and pulls her into the Solonian cubicle.) 
630,MARSHAL : Stop him! 
631,JO: What are you doing? 
632,KY: They will not shoot an Overlord. 
633,JO: But I'm not an Overlord. I've come to help you. 
634,"MARSHAL: Now, you fool! Shoot! "
635,"DOCTOR: No, you can't! "
636,MARSHAL: I said fire! 
637,"(The guards fire. There is a bright flash, and Ky and Jo are no longer"
638,there.) 
639, Episode Two
640,
641, [Skybase One transfer section]
642,
643, MARSHAL: (into comm.) Alert all ground stations.
644,Your friend won't get far without a mask. 
645,
646, [Solos transfer section]
647,
648," (Just like the one on the spaceship, with the same"
649,notices. Jo and Ky are having a discussion as they materialise.) 
650,KY: No Overlord can exist without a mask. 
651,JO: How many more times do I have to tell you I'm not an Overlord? 
652,"(In his cubicle, a guard hears the Marshal's orders.) "
653,MARSHAL : I want both of them. Do I make myself clear? 
654,(The guard leaves his cubicle and a klaxon sounds.) 
655,KY: Don't you see? You can't stay outside. The atmosphere is poisonous
656,to you. No Overlord can exist for more than a few hours without a mask.
657,
658,"JO: Well, what am I going to do? "
659,KY: You will stay here. I shall make a run for it. 
660,"JO: No, I'm coming with you. "
661,"KY: Look, I warn you. My life is more important than yours, to Solos"
662,and my people. I cannot stop to help you. 
663,JO: I'm coming with you. 
664,"KY: Shush, guards! "
665,"(The guard enters the transfer area and Ky jumps him from behind,"
666,knocking him out.) 
667,KY: Come on! 
668,(Ky pulls Jo along a short passage to the airlock. The guard recovers
669,enough to fire his weapon as they leave.)
670,
671, [Airlock]
672,
673, (Ky operates the outer door.) 
674,KY: You all right? 
675,JO: Fine so far. 
676,KY: Good. 
677,(They step out into the all pervasive mist.)
678,
679,[Marshal's office]
680,
681, DOCTOR: Bad news? 
682,"MARSHAL: Not for you, Doctor. For your friend. They have escaped on to"
683,the surface of Solos. 
684,DOCTOR: Ah. 
685,"MARSHAL: Still, without a mask. But never fear, Doctor, we shall find"
686,her. Or her body. 
687,"DOCTOR: Would you kindly explain that remark, sir? "
688,MARSHAL: During the hours of daylight no human can survive on Solos
689,without an oxymask. The soil contains a nitrogen isotope unknown on
690,Earth. The ultra-violet rays of the sun cause a kind of poisonous mist.
691,
692,DOCTOR: How poisonous? 
693,"MARSHAL: I give your friend an hour, possibly less, depending on how"
694,"fast they're travelling. I could, of course, step up the search. "
695,DOCTOR: May I suggest that you do so immediately? 
696,MARSHAL: Or I could call off the search altogether. Let them escape. 
697,DOCTOR: And let her die? You can't do that! 
698,"MARSHAL: I can do as I please, Doctor. And since the unfortunate"
699,"assassination of the Administrator, Solos is under martial law. My law."
700,
701,"DOCTOR: How very convenient for you. Now look, are you going to search"
702,for Miss Grant or not? 
703,"MARSHAL: That depends on you, Doctor. "
704,DOCTOR: Does it? 
705,"MARSHAL: Well, I thought you said this box was intended for Ky? "
706,DOCTOR: Apparently. 
707,MARSHAL: Then I shall want to know what's in it before he does. 
708,"DOCTOR: No, I'm sorry. That would be completely unethical. "
709,"MARSHAL: Then I shall be forced to recall my men, Doctor. We're"
710,"stretched very thin on Skybase. So many demands on our resources, you"
711,know. 
712,"DOCTOR: All right. I'll try and open the box for you, but I shall need"
713,your most advanced laboratory facilities. 
714,MARSHAL: (into comm.) Calling Solos. Intensify the search. 
715,DOCTOR: Marshal! 
716,MARSHAL: The girl must not be harmed. 
717,DOCTOR: That's better.
718,
719, [Solos]
720,
721, (Ky leads Jo at a run through the scrub until she
722,"falls, gasping for breath. He picks her up and carries her. Three"
723,guards are close behind.) 
724,STUBBS: This way. Funny. Only one now. Only one trace registering.
725,
726, [Skybase One laboratory]
727,
728,(A large room with computers on the walls and
729,catwalk around.) 
730,MARSHAL: Well? 
731,DOCTOR: Adequate. Not quite what I hoped for but adequate. 
732,MARSHAL: Adequate? What do you mean adequate? It's the finest
733,laboratory it's possible to build. 
734,"DOCTOR: Well, I was rather hoping for a particle reversal set-up. You"
735,"know, something that would turn the box inside out. But all this stuff,"
736,it seems for geared for atmosphere modulation. 
737,(They go down the steps to a large device in the middle of the lab.) 
738,DOCTOR: And this circuit's about to overload for a start. What is it
739,"anyway, weather control? "
740,"MARSHAL: Something of the sort. Now, tell me, Doctor "
741,(A little man in a brown uniform with a Germanic accent barges in.) 
742,"JAEGER: What the blazes is going on in here? Oh, it's you, Marshal. My"
743,apologies. But there was tampering with one of the circuits. 
744,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm terribly sorry, I'm afraid that was me. I'd no idea"
745,that the thing was operational. One of your circuits was about to
746,overload. 
747,"JAEGER: Marshal, I must insist! The experiment has reached a critical"
748,"stage. I'm working here alone and against time and, with respect, I"
749,can't afford to have you or anyone else interfering with it whenever
750,you feel like giving some stupid guided tour. 
751,"MARSHAL: Jaeger, that's enough. "
752,JAEGER: You give full priority to atmospheric regeneration and then you
753,expect me 
754,"MARSHAL: Jaeger! Jaeger! For the moment, Jaeger, I want you to give"
755,full priority to this little problem here. 
756,JAEGER: What? What is it? Who is this man? 
757,MARSHAL: An emissary from Earth. So he claims. 
758,(The Marshal's comm. whistles.) 
759,MARSHAL: Mmm? 
760,"VOICE : Varan's son's in your office, Marshal. "
761,"MARSHAL: (into comm.) Good. Hold him there. I'm sorry, gentlemen, I"
762,"cannot stay. The assassination, you understand? A man is being held."
763,"Jaeger, I want you to give the Doctor all the help he needs to get that"
764,"thing open. Doctor, I'll keep you informed about Miss Grant, and you'll"
765,"keep me informed about your progress, won't you."

767, [Solos]
768,
769," (With the guards close behind, Ky hides Jo in a"
770,stand of buddleia.) 
771,STUBBS: It's now two. Come on. 
772,"(Stubbs and Cotton go one way, the other guard in the opposite"
773,direction. Ky waits and then pounces on the lone guard and takes his
774,oxymask to Jo.)
775,
776, [Marshal's office]
777,
778, (The Marshal enters and dismisses his guards.) 
779,"MARSHAL: Greetings, son of Varan. "
780,VARAN JR: Why have I been brought here a prisoner? It was upon your
781,orders that I killed the Administrator. You said he was an enemy of our
782,people. 
783,MARSHAL: You've done well. Now for your reward. 
784,(The Marshal holds up the assassination device while Varan storms
785,through the corridors.) 
786,"MARSHAL: Amusing little device, isn't it? Works perfectly. "
787,(Varan Junior clutches his abdomen and falls dead. Varan enters and
788,goes to his son's body. He performs a customary rite over it.) 
789,VARAN: Achiksi. So. 
790,"MARSHAL: No regrets, Varan. First the Administrator, now an attempt to"
791,kill me. He was in league with Ky. 
792,(Varan draws his sword.) 
793,VARAN: You lie! You ordered us to kill the Administrator! 
794,MARSHAL: Others will believe me! 
795,(The Marshal fires at Varan but misses. Varan leaves and the Marshal
796,activates his baton-comm.) 
797,MARSHAL: Attention! Attention! This is the Marshal speaking.
798,
799, [Skybase One]
800,
801, MARSHAL : The Solonian Varan has gone mutant.
802,"He is at large on Skybase. If taken, he must be dealt with immediately."

811, (Stubbs and Cotton are by their fallen comrade.) 
812,"STUBBS: But we're almost on them, sir. "
813,MARSHAL : I want one of you up here immediately. Out. 
814,STUBBS: Stay here. 
815,COTTON: Thanks. Stubbsy? 
816,STUBBS: Yeah? 
817,COTTON: Someone's pinched his mask. 
818,STUBBS: I'll send some medics down to pick him up.

821,
822,(Jaeger has rigged up a laser looking probe device
823,aiming at the egg.) 
824,"DOCTOR: You know, I can't think why you people ever came here. "
825,"JAEGER: Thaesium, Doctor. This planet is one of the richest fuel"
826,"sources in the galaxy, or it used to be. "
827,DOCTOR: Are the deposits now exhausted? 
828,JAEGER: More or less. 
829,"DOCTOR: So, now you plan to colonise the planet in earnest, if you can"
830,change the atmosphere? 
831,"JAEGER: That's my problem, not yours. "
832,"DOCTOR: Well, there are other people concerned, you know? "
833,JAEGER: Such as? 
834,"DOCTOR: Well, the Solonians, for example. After all, it is their"
835,planet. 
836,"JAEGER: Was, Doctor. It is Doctor, is it? "
837,DOCTOR: I think you'll find that 
838,(The Doctor changes three plugs around on the probe.) 
839,"DOCTOR: That should hold the proton beam steady, Professor. "
840,JAEGER: I think that this whole thing is a senseless waste of time!
841,Particle reversal. Nobody has ever achieved it. 
842,"DOCTOR: On the contrary, my dear chap, I find it a very useful research"
843,technique. 
844,JAEGER: What do you expect to happen? 
845,DOCTOR: I expect the particles to reverse and for the box to turn
846,"itself inside out. What's on the outside will be on the inside, and"
847,what's on the inside will be on the outside where we can see it. 
848,JAEGER: Rubbish! 
849,DOCTOR: You think so? Come over here and see for yourself. 
850,(The Doctor unwinds the wires from around a control box and moves away
851,from the device.) 
852,DOCTOR: You ready? Then watch.

866,then takes her arms and gently lifts them above her head and down again
867,"onto her chest several times. She coughs, sits up and Ky removes the"
868,mask.) 
869,JO: What is this place? 
870,KY: A disused mine. One of many on Solos. 
871,JO: I remember running. 
872,KY: I nearly left you to die. 
873,JO: What about the mask? 
874,KY: A guard's. 
875,JO: He'll 
876,KY: He'll be all right if he takes it easy. You won't need this while
877,you're in here. The daylight makes the air poisonous to Overlords. You
878,"are from Earth, but you are not "
879,JO: The Doctor! We came to help you. 
880,"KY: Ah, the Overlord with the box. "
881,JO: For goodness sake. 
882,KY: I'm sorry. My people know Earth men only as Overlords. It's
883,difficult to think otherwise. 
884,"JO: The box, it was for you. But that's why I followed you. "
885,KY: Me? Why? 
886,JO: I don't know. 
887,KY: Is it weapons? 
888,JO: I don't know!

896,begin with. 
897,JAEGER: But it worked? 
898,"DOCTOR: Well, of course it worked. "
899,JAEGER: But theoretically it's impossible. 
900,"DOCTOR: I don't suppose you saw what it was, did you? Inside, I mean? "
901,"JAEGER: Not clearly, but the process "
902,"DOCTOR: Was all over in a flash. Yes, I know. "
903,(The Marshal and Stubbs enter.) 
904,MARSHAL: Is Varan here? 
905,DOCTOR: Who? 
906,"MARSHAL: Jaeger, have you seen him? Varan, the Mutt. "
907,DOCTOR: Another mutant? 
908,MARSHAL: He was heading this way. Jaeger! 
909,"JAEGER: No, Marshal, I haven't seen him. I've got more important things"
910,to do. 
911,"MARSHAL: So long as that Mutt stays alive, he's a menace to everybody"
912,on this Skybase. He was behind the assassination plot with Ky. 
913,DOCTOR: And now you say he's mutating? 
914,"GUARD : Mutant Varan hiding in storage section, sir. "
915,"STUBBS: They've located him, sir. "
916,"MARSHAL: All right, Stubbs, you know what to do. "
917,STUBBS: Sir. 
918,DOCTOR: Marshal? 
919,MARSHAL: Mmm? 
920,"DOCTOR: I wonder, could I perhaps go on this Mutt hunt with you? "
921,MARSHAL: Out of the question. 
922,JAEGER: I'm sure the Doctor has good reason. He'd find it most
923,interesting. 
924,MARSHAL: What? 
925,(Jaeger jerks his head to indicate 'get him out of here'.) 
926,"MARSHAL: Oh, very well. Stubbs? "
927,STUBBS: Sir? 
928,MARSHAL: Keep an eye on him. 
929,"STUBBS: Yes, sir. I will. "
930,(The Doctor and Stubbs leave.) 
931,MARSHAL: Well? 
932,"JAEGER: With that man's help, I could the whole atmosphere regeneration"
933,project operational within a week. 
934,MARSHAL: What? 
935,JAEGER: He understands particle reversal. He could speed up the whole
936,process. 
937,"MARSHAL: Then we must be sure he stays with us. Yes, his assistant's"
938,the key to that as well.

943,JO: How long before they track us down? 
944,KY: The caverns run for miles. They will never find us. 
945,JO: But that means neither will the Doctor. 
946,KY: We must wait. My people will tell me when the Doctor comes. 
947,JO: Your people? 
948,"KY: The dispossessed, the outcasts, the terrorists, as the Overlords"
949,label them. Tell me about the caverns of Earth. 
950,JO: The what? 
951,"KY: The caverns, where you live on Earth. "
952,JO: I live in London. 
953,KY: A sky city. 
954,"JO: No, London. London on the ground. "
955,"KY: No, I have seen pictures of Earth. No one lives on the ground. The"
956,air is too poisonous. And soon Solos will be the same. The Overlords
957,"only promise independence so they can go on plundering our resources,"
958,turning our green fields into their grey slagheaps. Am I not right? Is
959,it not true? 
960,JO: I don't know. It's rather a long time since I left Earth. 
961,KY: Once my people were farmers and nomads. Now look at them. Slaves in

963,"Mutts, as the Marshal calls them. Mutts! "
964,JO: What happens to them? 
965,KY: They are killed. Hunted down and killed. Or if they escape they
966,hide in places like these.

971, DOCTOR: What is this place anyway? What's it for? 
972,STUBBS: Seed propagation. Earth crops for Solos. Varan? Varan! It's no
973,"use, me old son. Let's get it over with. "
974,"DOCTOR: Get it over with? You don't intend shooting him in cold blood,"
975,do you? 
976,STUBBS: It's the only way. 
977,DOCTOR: How do you know? 
978,(They split up.) 
979,"STUBBS: Come on, Varan. Varan? Make it easy on yourself. "
980,"(Varan pricks Stubbs with his sword, making him drop his weapon. They"
981,struggle hand to hand.)

984,(The Doctor picks up Stubbs' weapon.) 
985,"DOCTOR: Varan, no! Varan! Varan, wait! "
986,(The Doctor shoots the sword out of Varan's hand then returns the
987,weapon to Stubbs.) 
988,"DOCTOR: Don't be a fool, Stubbs. Can't you see? There's no sign of any"
989,mutation. 
990,STUBBS: But the Marshal said he was a mutant. 
991,VARAN: The Marshal has murdered my son.

1000,COTTON: Sir. Sir? 
1001,MARSHAL: Well? 
1002,COTTON: At least it means the girl is still alive. 
1003,"MARSHAL: Yes, Cotton. But Ky has got her and not us. I want that girl"
1004,"found, understand? One more thing. As far as the Doctor is concerned,"
1005,we have already got her. 
1006,COTTON: Sir? 
1007,"MARSHAL: We have already got her, Cotton. She's in hospital on Solos."

1012, STUBBS: You mean His Nibs fixed up the whole
1013,thing? Had the Administrator done in and then swung the blame on the
1014,natives? 
1015,DOCTOR: That's right. You heard Varan's story. 
1016,STUBBS: I see. And if there's independence the Marshal's out of a job. 
1017,"DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. But now the planet's under marshal law, his nibs,"
1018,"as you call him, means to keep it that way. "
1019,STUBBS: So what do we do? 
1020,DOCTOR: Keep Varan in hiding. Tell the Marshal he's been dealt with. I
1021,can't move against him openly until I am sure Miss Grant is safe. I'll
1022,just have to play for time.

1029,DOCTOR: Dealt with. 
1030,"MARSHAL: These Mutts are a bigger menace than you realise, Doctor. As"
1031,no doubt Miss Grant will tell you. 
1032,"DOCTOR: You've found her, then? When can I see her? "
1033,MARSHAL: Cotton? 
1034,COTTON: She's receiving oxygen treatment. In a day or so. 
1035,DOCTOR: A day or so? 
1036,MARSHAL: Possibly longer. She was in pretty poor shape when Cotton
1037,found her. 
1038,DOCTOR: What about Ky? 
1039,"MARSHAL: Ky left her to die, Doctor. The whole planet will remain under"
1040,"marshal law until the fuss of the assassination dies down. Meanwhile,"
1041,"Doctor, Professor Jaeger could use you on a project of some urgency. It"
1042,will pass the time.

1048,(Jaeger's plan is being drawn out on a wall

1050,JAEGER: What I propose to do is to bombard these layers of the
1051,atmosphere with ionisation rockets at these points. This will provide a
1052,barrier against the ultra-violet rays which create the poison mist. 
1053,"DOCTOR: What you're proposing, and do correct me if I am wrong, is an"
1054,all out rocket attack on a defenceless planet. 
1055,JAEGER: But these aren't military rockets. 
1056,DOCTOR: Try telling the Solonians that. 
1057,"JAEGER: I can't understand your concern, Doctor. This planet, as it"
1058,"stands, is no longer of any use unless we make the atmosphere"
1059,breathable. 
1060,DOCTOR: Even if it means wiping out every Solonian in the process? 
1061,JAEGER: Earth is fighting for its survival. The side-effects are of no
1062,importance! 
1063,"DOCTOR: Genocide is a side-effect? You ought to write a paper on that,"
1064,Professor. 
1065,JAEGER: Perhaps you have an alternative suggestion? 
1066,"DOCTOR: Yes, perhaps. "
1067,"JAEGER: Particle reversal, no doubt. Your little forte? "
1068,"DOCTOR: Particle reversal is one way. Not as violent as yours, of"
1069,"course, but the result will be the same. "
1070,"JAEGER: The question is, Doctor, can it be done? "
1071,"DOCTOR: Well, we could try an experiment, couldn't we? "
1072,(Cotton enters.) 
1073,"COTTON: The Marshal wants to see you, Professor. "
1074,JAEGER: Can't it wait? 
1075,COTTON: You know the Marshal. 
1076,"JAEGER: Oh, very well then. "
1077,(Jaeger leaves.) 
1078,COTTON: Sir? 
1079,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
1080,COTTON: I've been chatting with Stubbs. He's a kind of mate of mine. 
1081,DOCTOR: Oh yes? 
1082,"COTTON: About Varan, and about Miss Grant. "
1083,"DOCTOR: When can I see her, Cotton? "
1084,"COTTON: That's it, sir. You can't. We didn't find her. "
1085,DOCTOR: What? 
1086,"COTTON: As far as we know, she's still with Ky. "
1087,DOCTOR: That means I've got to find both of them. How am I going to do
1088,that? 
1089,COTTON: All the guards have orders to stop you leaving this section. 
1090,DOCTOR: Is there any other way to the transfer station? 
1091,"COTTON: Afraid not, sir. "
1092,"DOCTOR: Cotton, is there an emergency power supply to the transfer"
1093,station? 
1094,"COTTON: Yes, it. Why, sir? "
1095,DOCTOR: What would happen if I blew the main power supply to the whole
1096,of Skybase? 
1097,COTTON: Sheer chaos. 
1098,"DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. But if the emergency power supply to the transfer"
1099,station were already switched over. 
1100,COTTON: You could slip down to Solos in the confusion. 
1101,"DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Can you get the power switched over? "
1102,COTTON: I can try. 
1103,"DOCTOR: Good, now I'll tell you what I want you to do "
1104,(Jaeger enters.) 
1105,"JAEGER: Cotton, who told you that the Marshal wanted to see me? "
1106,"COTTON: He did, sir. "
1107,JAEGER: Then one of you must be mad. 
1108,"COTTON: Oh, yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Maybe he changed his mind, sir. "
1109,(Cotton leaves.) 
1110,"DOCTOR: Professor, I've been thinking. Perhaps we could try an"
1111,"experiment, just to prove whether I'm right or wrong about particle"
1112,reversal. 
1113,JAEGER: Good.

1129,"STUBBS: When the time comes, you head straight for the transfer"
1130,"station, but wait for the signal first. "
1131,VARAN: What signal? 
1132,STUBBS: You'll hear them announce a power failure. That'll be your

1144,"would you? Well, are you ready? "

1177, (The Doctor and Varan stagger out of the cubicle.
1178,The Doctor gives Varan a sharp elbow in the midriff to break free then
1179,hits him twice. Varan draws his short sword and the Doctor uses his
1180,Venusian karate paralysing grip to stop him in mid thrust.) 
1181,"DOCTOR: Now, you listen to me, Varan. For the last time, I tell you I"
1182,am not an Overlord. I've come to help your people but I must find Ky. 
1183,"VARAN: Ky is my enemy! I will destroy him and you too, Overlord! "
1184,DOCTOR: You will take me to Ky or I will leave you here for the guards
1185,"to find. Now, do you give me your word as a warrior? "
1186,(Varan nods and the Doctor releases him.) 
1187,DOCTOR: Lead the way.

1191,VARAN: Firestorms. 
1192,"DOCTOR: Firestorms, is that all? "
1193,VARAN: It is the wrath of the gods. 
1194,"DOCTOR: It's a simple atmospheric disturbance, Varan, and something"
1195,very much to our advantage. 
1196,(They arrive at the airlock inner door.)

1206,JO: How long do they usually last? 
1207,"KY: The firestorms? At first it was a few minutes, now it can go on all"
1208,"night. Each one longer than the last, terrifying my people. "
1209,JO: Surely they're used to these thunderstorms? 
1210,KY: There were no firestorms on Solos until the Marshal began his
1211,experiments. 
1212,JO: Experiments? 
1213,KY: To make our air breathable for the Overlords but not for the
1214,"Solonians. It would mean the end of my people, Miss Grant. "

1222,Marshal's experiments. 
1223,(The mutant comes closer. It's hands are now claws and it's head has
1224,two large mandibles and staring eyes. Ky frightens it off with fire.) 
1225,JO: I thought you said they were harmless. 
1226,KY: I don't understand it. Perhaps it's the firestorm. Usually they run

1245,"MARSHAL: A booby trap, Jaeger, so he could escape. "
1246,JAEGER: It was a particle reversal. I know it was. 
1247,MARSHAL: Forget particle reversal. Get those rockets ready! You'll have
1248,to go ahead on your own now. 
1249,"JAEGER: Marshal, you don't realise. I am just not ready. Without"

1285,"VARAN: Then you must find him alone, Doctor. Varan goes no further. "

1339,KY: I have seen such signs. 
1340,"DOCTOR: Well, read it, man. Well, what does it say? Read it! "
1341,"KY: Why, I cannot. It is the language of the old ones. No one"
1342,remembers. All our culture has been destroyed by the Overlords. 
1343,DOCTOR: But you've seen this kind of writing before? 
1344,KY: Signs like these are carved in rocks all over Solos. But no one
1345,"knows, no one remembers. As far as we are concerned, Doctor, they are"
1346,meaningless squiggles. 
1347,"DOCTOR: Yes, but they must mean something, otherwise why would I have"
1348,been sent here? 
1349,"VARAN: Why indeed? Come. If we stay here, they will surely attack"
1350,again. 
1351,"DOCTOR: No, I'm sorry, I can't go yet. "
1352,VARAN: You are fools! 
1353,DOCTOR: I can't go yet. Not without Miss Grant. 
1354,VARAN: Is this the way to fight the Overlords? To stay here and be
1355,"killed by Mutts? If you will not fight, Varan will. "
1356,"DOCTOR: Now, Varan, wait. Varan, wait! "
1357,(Varan leaves. Ky puts the tablets back in the egg and it closes.) 
1358,"KY: He will go back to his village and he and his men, for all their"
1359,"valour, will be wiped out. Swords are no use against the Overlord. "
1360,"DOCTOR: No. Right, Ky. Take me to Miss Grant. "
1361,"KY: This way, Doctor. "
1362,DOCTOR: There must be somebody on Solos who understands the old
1363,language. 
1364,"KY: There was a man called, er, Sondergaard. A man of learning from"

1398,ever experienced. The Solonian summer. 
1399,MARSHAL: Hmm? 
1400,"JAEGER: Ever since we've been here, five hundred years, it's been"
1401,"spring. Now, summer. It may become too hot for any human being to live"
1402,here. 
1403,"MARSHAL: And it may not. That's for you to find out, Jaeger. My first"
1404,priority is to wipe out the Mutts. 
1405,JAEGER: The reports also indicate a very sudden rise in the mutation
1406,"rate. More Mutts than ever, Marshal, and all moving towards your target"
1407,area. 
1408,MARSHAL: Good. Good then. The more the merrier.

1411,
1412, (Varan waits until a guard walks past him down the
1413,"mine entrance, then runs outside. The other three members of the patrol"
1414,start shooting as he dodges through the scrub. The four chase him a
1415,short way then give up.)

1418,
1419, (Ky and the Doctor meet back in the main cave.) 
1420,KY: No? 
1421,DOCTOR: No. 
1422,KY: But she must be here! 
1423,"DOCTOR: Well, we'll just have to search them all over again, won't we? "
1424,"KY: If the torches last, and they don't attack. "
1425,"DOCTOR: What, you heard them? "
1426,KY: They're watching us all the time. 
1427,DOCTOR: Yes. They don't attack us in the tunnels. Only in here. This
1428,chamber must be important to them. 
1429,KY: I feel it myself. 
1430,DOCTOR: Feel what? 
1431,"KY: A sensation. An awareness of being drawn here. This is a warm, safe"
1432,place. A centre. A sort of instinct. 
1433,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, it's strange. Let's keep searching. Come on."
1434,
1435, [Mine passage] 
1436, MARSHAL: Hurry up. I want those gas grenades here.
1437,"Give me those blast packs. No one else is to know about this,"
1438,understood? 
1439,(The two guards leave. Stubbs and Cotton arrive and the Marshal hides
1440,the blast packs behind his back.) 
1441,MARSHAL: Everything ready? 
1442,"STUBBS: Yes sir. Er, excuse me, sir? "
1443,MARSHAL: Well? 
1444,"STUBBS: I think we should do something about finding the Doctor, sir. "
1445,MARSHAL: Do you now. 
1446,"STUBBS: Professor Jaeger said he was important, sir. "
1447,"MARSHAL: Well, Cotton? "
1448,"COTTON: I agree, sir. "
1449,"MARSHAL: I thought you would. Very well, Stubbs, you and Cotton. I'll"
1450,"give you fifteen minutes, no more. "
1451,"STUBBS: Right, sir. "
1452,MARSHAL: You keep in radio contact all the way. 
1453,STUBBS: Sir. 
1454,"MARSHAL: I want to hear every word. And if you come across Ky, make"
1455,sure you make a better job of him than you did of Varan!
1456,
1457, [Varan's village]
1458,
1459, VARAN: Ho! Varan is returned! 
1460,(An old man is lying on a cot in a rough hut.) 
1461,OLD MAN: Varan. 
1462,VARAN: What has happened? Where are my people? 
1463,OLD MAN: The fire. 
1464,VARAN: Speak! 
1465,OLD MAN: The firestorms. Evil. A plague of evil. Fire from the sky. 
1466,"VARAN: Listen to me. Summon my council. Go, beat the war gong! "
1467,"(The old man does so, and shows us that he has started mutating.)"

1471,COTTON: Doctor? 
1472,STUBBS: Doctor? 
1473,STUBBS : Doctor? Doctor? 
1474,KY: Overlords! We must abandon the search. They will trap us here. 
1475,STUBBS : Doctor! 
1476,COTTON : Doctor! 
1477,"DOCTOR: All right. Quick, back to the chamber. "
1478,STUBBS: Let's try this way.
1479,
1480, [Cave]
1481,
1482, KY: If they attack now 
1483,DOCTOR: Shush! Wait. listen. 
1484,(They hear someone moan.) 
1485,"DOCTOR: That's Jo Grant in there somewhere. Jo? Jo, are you in there?"
1486,Jo? 
1487,"(Jo is in a side chamber, lying on the ground.) "
1488,"DOCTOR: Jo? Jo, are you all right? Jo? "
1489,JO: Doctor. 
1490,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's all right. It's me. "
1491,(Searchlights flood the alcove.) 
1492,"STUBBS: Ah, there you are. "
1493,"KY: Run, Doctor! "
1494,"DOCTOR: No, Ky!"
1495,
1496, [Mine passage] 
1497," STUBBS : It's us, Doctor. Stubbs and Cotton."
1498,Is Miss Grant with you? 
1499,"DOCTOR : Yes, she's over here. She appears to be injured. "
1500,(The Marshal turns off his comm. and speaks to his guards.) 
1501,"MARSHAL: Right, prepare the grenades. "
1502,"GUARD: But, sir, they're all in there. "
1503,MARSHAL: Exactly. Fire the grenades. 
1504,(The guards throw the gas grenades further down the passage.) 
1505,MARSHAL: Pull out! Everyone out of the cave. 
1506,(The Marshal fastens the detonators to the passage wall and triggers
1507,"them, setting the timer.) "
1508,"MARSHAL: (into comm.) All sections, seal off exits. Fire grenades."
1509,
1510, [Cave]
1511,
1512, STUBBS: (into comm.) Hello? Hello? Lost contact. 
1513,"(The thick, heavy gas drifts along the mine passages.)"
1514,
1515, [Varan's village]
1516,
1517, VARAN: Why does no one come? Where are my
1518,warriors? 
1519,"OLD MAN: Your warriors have fled, Varan. "
1520,VARAN: Am I left with nothing but mutants? 
1521,"OLD MAN: They too. It is the way with us all, old and young, those who"
1522,"can walk have gone to the mines, Varan, to the mines. "
1523,VARAN: Why? Why has this curse come upon us? 
1524,(Varan sees scales forming on the back of his hand.) 
1525,"VARAN: Urgh! No! No, no, no, no! "
1526,"VARAN : Go, Varan. Go to the place of sleeping. The place of"
1527,"darkness and light. Go, Varan, go. Go. Go. Go. "
1528,"VARAN: No. No, I was born to fight. Varan will not die sleeping!"
1529,
1530, [Cave]
1531,
1532, (A group of mutants in a passageway encounter the
1533,"gas, and collapse.) "
1534,"JO: A passageway, full of light. Even the rocks were glowing. I"
1535,remember walking towards the light. 
1536,DOCTOR: Yes? 
1537,"JO: And then there was this noise in my head. I couldn't hear, I"
1538,couldn't see properly. It was then I started to get dizzy. 
1539,DOCTOR: Mmm hmm. 
1540,"JO: There was a figure, a silvery figure. "
1541,DOCTOR: A mutant? 
1542,JO: I don't know. 
1543,"DOCTOR: Well, and then what? "
1544,"JO: I'm sorry, Doctor. I fainted. "
1545,"DOCTOR: Well, whatever it was, it brought you back here. "
1546,STUBBS: I'd better tell His Nibs what's going on. 
1547,"DOCTOR: Here, just a minute. I don't particularly want to find myself"
1548,"in the Marshal's hands again, thank you very much. "
1549,"COTTON: Better off on Skybase than in here. You'll have to hurry, old"
1550,son. The attack's due to start any minute now. 
1551,DOCTOR: Attack? 
1552,COTTON: Gas. The Marshal's solution to what he calls the Mutt problem. 
1553,JO: Doesn't he know we're in here? 
1554,KY: He knows. 
1555,"COTTON: I think we ought to move out now, before it's too late."
1556,
1557, [Outside the mine entrance]
1558,
1559, MARSHAL: What's the count? 
1560,"GUARD: It seems to be swarming with Mutts, sir. They're attracted to"
1561,the place. 
1562,"MARSHAL: Mmm, they go there to die. They have the old idea of the"
1563,"elephant's graveyard. Right, should be any moment now. "
1564,(Bang! Bang! Smoke and debris drift out of the mine entrance. Below
1565,"ground, Stubbs smells the gas, then sees it and runs back.)"
1566,
1567, [Cave]
1568,
1569," DOCTOR: Let me see those tablets again, Ky. The"
1570,answer must be here somewhere. 
1571,STUBBS: Doctor! Gas! They've started the attack already. 
1572,COTTON: We've got to get out. 
1573,STUBBS: We can't get out. The Marshal's sealed us in. 
1574,COTTON: What are we going to do? 
1575,(The gas starts to drift into the cave.) 
1576, Episode Four
1577,
1578, [Cave]
1579,
1580, JO: Look! 
1581,(Jo points at a silver-suited figure. It gestures for them to come
1582,towards it.) 
1583,"JO: That's it. The thing I saw. No, don't shoot. Look. "
1584,(The mine rumbles.) 
1585,"DOCTOR: Whatever it is, I think we'd better follow it. Come on."
1586,
1587, [Mine passage]
1588,
1589,(This passage is clear of gas. There are distant
1590,explosions.) 
1591,STUBBS: Making sure of it this time. 
1592,COTTON: Huh? 
1593,STUBBS: The Marshal. That's the exits. 
1594,COTTON: Was the exits. 
1595,STUBBS: Yeah. 
1596,KY: The Overlords are very thorough. 
1597,"STUBBS: If it goes on like this, the whole lot'll come down. "
1598,"COTTON: On top of us. Hurry up, Stubbsy! "
1599,"STUBBS: All right, all right. "
1600,COTTON: Where's he talking us anyway? 
1601,(They arrive at a large metal door set in the passage wall. The suited
1602,figure opens it and steps inside. The Doctor takes something from his
1603,pocket and tests the edge of the door.) 
1604,"DOCTOR: Lead. What does lead mean to you, Jo? "
1605,JO: Radiation? 
1606,"DOCTOR: Yes, exactly."
1607,
1608, [Sondergaard's laboratory]
1609,
1610, (They go inside a room with a laboratory bench and
1611,some equipment. The suited figure closes the door and removes its
1612,"helmet and gloves, revealing himself to be a cheerful bald human male"
1613,with a European accent.) 
1614,SONDERGAARD: Welcome. You must not be alarmed. My name is 
1615,"DOCTOR: Professor Sondergaard, I presume. "
1616, [Solos]
1617,
1618," MARSHAL: Right, I am returning to Skybase. I want"
1619,every exit sealed. Understand? Every exit. 
1620,"GUARD: That's impossible, sir. These mine galleries stretch for miles."
1621,We'll be here for weeks. 
1622,"MARSHAL: Mmm hmm. Give the gas a while to disperse, then take a squad"
1623,"down to the galleries. Who knows, you may find some survivors down"
1624,"there. Right, I'm returning to the Skybase. Report to me there."
1625,
1626, [Sondergaard's laboratory]
1627,
1628, (Sondergaard takes off the rest of the suit. He is
1629,wearing Solonian clothes underneath.) 
1630,SONDERGAARD: There is radioactivity present throughout the cave system.
1631,"Oh, it's natural in a thaesium mine, and it's not dangerous, unless"
1632,"you're here for many years, as I am, or unless you find yourself in an"
1633,"unstable zone, as you did, young lady. The entrance you found led you"
1634,straight to the heart of the most dangerous radioactivity. 
1635,"JO: So it was you I saw, and you brought me out. "
1636,"SONDERGAARD: Ha! I didn't know what to do. I couldn't let you die, so I"
1637,carried you as quickly as I could out of the radioactive zone to where
1638,I hoped your friends would find you. 
1639,"JO: Well, thank you, Professor. "
1640,KY: You were given up for dead years ago. 
1641,"SONDERGAARD: Yes, so were many others in the mines. The mutants, for"
1642,example. 
1643,"JO: The mutants? Well, they attacked us and tried to kill us. "
1644,"SONDERGAARD: Yes, I know. There are more now, many more, and as their"
1645,"numbers increase, so it seems does their aggression. Oh, it's not an"
1646,isolated phenomenon. The same behaviour may be observed in rats when
1647,confined. 
1648,KY: And who did this to my people? Who hunted them down like wild
1649,animals? The Overlords! 
1650,"DOCTOR: This, er, increase in aggression that you speak of. It seems to"
1651,be spreading. 
1652,"KY: Aggression, yes! And who were the first aggressors? "
1653,"DOCTOR: Ky! This is not a political meeting. We're all on your side,"
1654,"you know, all of us. "
1655,KY: Him? Why does he hide in these caves? To experiment on my people! 
1656,"DOCTOR: Look, give him a chance to explain! "
1657,"JO: Please, Ky. "
1658,"SONDERGAARD: Well, he has my sympathies. Do you think I've chosen to"
1659,"live here? To work with this primitive equipment? I was young,"
1660,ambitious. I hoped to make many great discoveries here. And my first
1661,was that Solos had become a slave colony. I was unwise enough to try to
1662,inform Earth control. The Marshal intercepted my report. I was lucky to
1663,escape with my life. I managed to reach the caves. I've been here ever
1664,since. 
1665,DOCTOR: But you have continued with your research? 
1666,"SONDERGAARD: As well as I could. As you see, I lack equipment. If it"
1667,"were not for the mutants, I would not have been able to survive here. "
1668,KY: My people help you? 
1669,SONDERGAARD: They did. We were all outcasts. We helped one another.
1670,"Once they stole food for me, and clothing. "
1671,DOCTOR: And now? 
1672,SONDERGAARD: Now they don't come near me. It is as if I were 
1673,KY: Diseased? 
1674,SONDERGAARD: Who knows? Perhaps they're right. Strange things are
1675,"happening on Solos, Doctor. Oh, not just to the people, but to the"
1676,"plants, the soil, the atmosphere, even the weather. The whole flora and"
1677,fauna of Solos. 
1678,(The Doctor looks at specimens of plants in jars.) 
1679,DOCTOR: Professor Jaeger's experiments. 
1680,"SONDERGAARD: Exactly, and my belief is this. At first the changes were"
1681,"natural, but now Professor Jaeger's experiments have accelerated the"
1682,changes and something is seriously wrong. 
1683,DOCTOR: Yes. Yes indeed. But why was I sent here? Where do these
1684,tablets come in? Ky. 
1685,(Ky opens the egg.)
1686,
1687, [Skybase One laboratory]
1688,
1689,(Jaeger is working on the particle reversal
1690,device.) 
1691,MARSHAL: Are the ionisation rockets deployed? 
1692,JAEGER: Hmm? 
1693,"MARSHAL: The rockets, man, for the bombardment! "
1694,"JAEGER: Marshal, this is not a war. "
1695,MARSHAL: Oh? 
1696,JAEGER: This is a scientific application of ballistics. An experiment
1697,to show that population control can be affected by atmospheric means. 
1698,"MARSHAL: Of course, of course, Jaeger, but let's get on with it, shall"
1699,"we? Experiments, population control. Jargon, Jaeger! This is war!"
1700,
1701, [Sondergaard's laboratory]
1702,
1703, (Four stone tablets are on the lab bench.) 
1704,"SONDERGAARD: Extraordinary. This wonderful, Doctor, marvellous. "
1705,"DOCTOR: Yes, but what do they mean? "
1706,SONDERGAARD: This is the same kind of hieroglyphs I've seen in the old
1707,temples. 
1708,(Sondergaard fetches a paper.) 
1709,"SONDERGAARD: All over Solos you see the same symbols, you see. "
1710,(It is a copy of a symbol that was on the cave wall.) 
1711,"DOCTOR: Yes, I can see that, Professor, but can you read them? "
1712,"SONDERGAARD: Well, I can try. I have approximate translations for many"
1713,of the basic symbols. One might call this the Solonian book of Genesis.
1714,"The lost tablets. This, Doctor, is the story of how Solonian"
1715,civilisation began. 
1716,(There is an explosion and part of the ceiling comes down.) 
1717,"DOCTOR: And ended, if we don't get a move on, I think. "
1718,"STUBBS: Doctor, that wasn't a blast pack, or a grenade. That was the"
1719,"mountain itself. The tunnels are falling in. Now if we stay here, we're"
1720,finished. All of us. 
1721,"DOCTOR: Professor. Professor, is there another way out? "
1722,"SONDERGAARD: Yes, yes, there is a way, but it's dangerous. It leads to"
1723,a native village a few miles from here. 
1724,KY: Varan's? 
1725,"SONDERGAARD: Yes, I believe so. "
1726,"STUBBS: Well, let's go then! "
1727,"SONDERGAARD: No, no, no, I must stay. "
1728,STUBBS: Doctor? 
1729,"DOCTOR: No. Sorry, Stubbs, no, you go. Take Miss Grant with you. The"
1730,Professor and I have got work to do. 
1731,"JO: You're not going to stay here, Doctor? "
1732,"DOCTOR: Jo. Look, the key to everything lies here in this room. These"
1733,"tablets, Professor Sondergaard's records. I must find the answer. "
1734,"JO: Yes, I know but you heard what he said. The whole mountain is"
1735,caving in. 
1736,DOCTOR: We shall have time. 
1737,"JO: But, Doctor, you can't "
1738,"DOCTOR: Jo, please. Please, don't argue with me. I'll join you later. "
1739,"STUBBS: Come on, Miss Grant. What about Varan? "
1740,KY: I can handle him. 
1741,"SONDERGAARD: To find the shaft that leads to the passageway, take"
1742,always the path leading up. 
1743,"(Stubbs, Ky, Jo and Cotton leave.) "
1744,"SONDERGAARD: Now then, Doctor. Now, this particular symbol here, for"
1745,"instance, is the Solonian symbol for life. "
1746,(The four make their way up a passage. Jo stumbles and sees a mutant
1747,some way behind them.) 
1748,"SONDERGAARD: Now then, this pattern repeated is almost the same, and"
1749,this is the Solonian sun symbol. 
1750,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, they aren't numbers, so it can't be a code. Let's"
1751,"try something else. Fire, earth, air, water. No, all right, that's no"
1752,good. 
1753,"SONDERGAARD: Well, er, a cycle, perhaps, representing some form of"
1754,chemical process. 
1755,"DOCTOR: Yes, but the process keeps repeating itself. What process"
1756,repeats itself? 
1757,"SONDERGAARD: Well, life. "
1758,DOCTOR: Life in some form will always go on. 
1759,(Another bit of ceiling falls in.) 
1760,SONDERGAARD: Let's hope so. 
1761,DOCTOR: Yes.
1762,
1763, [Mine passage] 
1764, (Jo spots a guard down a side passage.) 
1765,"JO: Look, a guard! "
1766,(Ky ducks down another side passage. Cotton grabs Jo and Stubbs runs
1767,back as the guard raises his weapon.) 
1768,"STUBBS: All right, mate? It's me, Stubbs. Here, old Scottie. "
1769,(The guard shoots at Stubbs but misses. Ky comes round behind him and
1770,knocks him out.) 
1771,STUBBS: Come on. Better try this way.
1772,
1773, [Sondergaard's laboratory]
1774, 
1775,
1776, DOCTOR: It must be a code of some kind. It must.
1777,"Eureka, it's a calendar! Spring, summer, autumn, winter. "
1778,SONDERGAARD: But Solos has no seasons. It does not tilt on its axis
1779,relative to its sun. 
1780,"DOCTOR: Well, it may not tilt, Professor, but it could move closer."
1781,"Look, these ellipses here, they're the orbits. "
1782,SONDERGAARD: But Solos takes two thousand years to go round its sun. We
1783,know that. 
1784,DOCTOR: Then the seasons must be five hundred years long. 
1785,SONDERGAARD: Possibly. 
1786,"DOCTOR: See, these signs here. They only appear in the summer. And"
1787,these little matchstick men here only appear in the spring. 
1788,"SONDERGAARD: Yes, but what about these spirals? They're like small sun"
1789,symbols. 
1790,"DOCTOR: Yes, like small sun symbols. Well, yes, but that's it! That"
1791,that's what I said. That's radiation. That's thaesium radiation! So
1792,"that's why they sent me here. Professor, I want you to take me to that"
1793,place where you found Jo Grant. 
1794,STUBBS: The radiation cave? But I've only one suit. If you spend any
1795,"time in there without one, Doctor, you will die. Any man would. "
1796,"DOCTOR: Any man, perhaps. "
1797,(More debris falls from the ceiling.) 
1798,"DOCTOR: Hurry, Professor."
1799,
1800, [Mine passage] 
1801,(The four have found another upwards passage.) 
1802,STUBBS: This is it. Look! 
1803,(A shaft leads straight to the surface.) 
1804,"STUBBS: If we can reach that ledge. Right, Cotton, you first, then Ky. "
1805,JO: If only we had a rope. 
1806,(A Solonian looks down at them.) 
1807,COTTON: What? What is it? 
1808,JO: Look! 
1809,(The Solonian has disappeared.) 
1810,"JO: There was someone there, I tell you. There was! "
1811,"COTTON: Well, he's not there now, Miss. "
1812,JO: But he was there. He was wearing a helmet. 
1813,KY: A warrior? 
1814,JO: Could have been. 
1815,"KY: If we are near Varan's village, his people are in a savage mood. "
1816,COTTON: Right. 
1817,(Cotton climbs the rough walls of the shaft.) 
1818,STUBBS: Anything? 
1819,"COTTON: No, nothing! "
1820,"STUBBS: Right, up you go. "
1821,"KY: Varan will be somewhere near. (Ky goes next, closely followed by Jo"
1822,and Stubbs.)

1830,"fight, one last time? "

1836,
1837, DOCTOR: Where is it? 
1838,SONDERGAARD: This section here. 
1839,"(The entrance is sealed by a large round, carved stone.) "
1840,"DOCTOR: Right, there it is. How do we move it? "
1841,SONDERGAARD: That way. 
1842,DOCTOR: This way. Right? 
1843,SONDERGAARD: Yes. 
1844,(They roll the stone away from the opening and pulsing light floods
1845,out. Sondergaard seems hypnotised by the rhythm.) 
1846,"DOCTOR: Your helmet, Professor. Your helmet, man! "
1847,"SONDERGAARD: Oh, yes. What about you, Doctor? The intensity in there is"
1848,far greater. 
1849,DOCTOR: Don't worry about me. I've already prepared myself. Ready? Come
1850,on. 
1851, [Radiation cavern] 
1852, (Their movements are slightly slower than normal
1853,as they walk through the ever shifting light patterns.)

1858, (Cotton is sharing his oxymask with Jo. The
1859,village seems empty and the fire has gone out underneath the cauldron.

1870,(The Doctor half carries Sondergaard a little further.) 
1871,"SONDERGAARD: No. No, I can't. You, you go. Leave me. "
1872,"(Sondergaard falls to the ground. Shielding his eyes with his hands,"
1873,"the Doctor reluctantly goes on towards a bright, shining figure. He"
1874,takes a large carved gemstone from it then makes his way back to
1875,Sondergaard. He helps the man up then hoists him over his shoulders in
1876,a fireman's lift and carries him out of the cavern.)

1880,(The four are now tied up.) 
1881,"VARAN: Overlords, you will suffer as I have suffered. And you,"
1882,"renegade, will die. "
1883,"KY: You are a fool, Varan. Attack Skybase and you will sacrifice your"
1884,men for nothing. 
1885,VARAN: What have we to fear? We have nothing left now but revenge. 
1886,"KY: You cannot hope to get into Skybase, much less destroy it. "
1887,"VARAN: You forget. We have the Overlords, we have their weapons. You"
1888,"and the woman will act as shields. So you see, renegade, you will die"
1889,"for a cause. The cause of Varan's revenge. Now, move! "
1890,WARRIOR: Move!

1896,"JAEGER: Started? Marshal, are you aware how long it takes to check out"
1897,an orbital rocket? 
1898,"MARSHAL: You have the engineers, haven't you? "
1899,JAEGER: They've deteriorated almost as much as the hardware. 
1900,"MARSHAL: Huh! Excuses, Jaeger, excuses! "
1901,(The comm. trills.) 
1902,MARSHAL: Yes? 
1903,MAN : Message from deep space. 
1904,MARSHAL: What? 
1905,MAN : Message reads. Unscheduled Hyperion space shuttle now on
1906,course Solos. ETA twenty two twenty twenty nine Solos time. Earth
1907,Council investigator on board. 
1908,MARSHAL: Investigator? What investigator? 
1909,MAN : Message ends. 
1910,MARSHAL: Blast the Earth council. Who do they think they are?
1911,Investigator? Investigating what? 
1912,JAEGER: Your activities should give him plenty of scope. 
1913,"MARSHAL: Jaeger, if I didn't need you. Now, listen to me. When this"
1914,"investigator arrives, he will be met with a fait accompli. Your"
1915,"experiments will have been carried out, the Mutts will have been"
1916,eliminated and the air on Solos will be breathable. Understand? 
1917,JAEGER: But the rockets are only half ready. 
1918,"MARSHAL: Either they go or you go, Professor Jaeger. I intend to meet"
1919,"this investigator on the planet's surface itself, face to face, without"
1920,masks.

1926,STUBBS: Yeah. His Nibs wants to see us. 
1927,(Varan comes up behind the guard and knocks him out with his claw. The
1928,warriors hustle Ky and Jo in.) 
1929,"VARAN: You did well, Overlords. Now the way to Skybase lies open. "
1930,"STUBBS: You don't stand a chance, Varan. "
1931,VARAN: We're prepared to die. 
1932,"JO: What good will that do? Believe me, the Doctor will help you find a"
1933,cure. 
1934,VARAN: There is no cure for this!
1935,
1936,[Sondergaard's laboratory]
1937,
1938," DOCTOR: Yes, of course. The Solonians are meant to"
1939,mutate. The mutation is part of it. A part of an evolution. They're
1940,meant to change as their environment changes every five hundred years.
1941,"A life cycle unique in the history of the universe. And now, thanks to"
1942,"the Marshal, threatened with extinction. "
1943,SONDERGAARD: So it's not a sickness. 
1944,"DOCTOR: No, it's a metamorphosis, an adaptive change. The mutants, as"
1945,"we know them, are an intermediate form. "
1946,SONDERGAARD: And we've yet to see the final metamorphosis? 
1947,DOCTOR: Exactly. The radiation cave is the key to that. 
1948,SONDERGAARD: The tablets led us to the crystal. 
1949,"DOCTOR: Yes. It must play a vital part in the process, but what? "
1950,SONDERGAARD: Maybe that the cellular change is only affected by the
1951,particular radiation in the crystal. 
1952,DOCTOR: That's the extraordinary thing about it. It shows absolutely no
1953,"radioactivity at all. Here, try it for yourself. "
1954,SONDERGAARD: That's impossible. 
1955,(Sondergaard runs a Geiger detector over the crystal.) 
1956,DOCTOR: Apparently not. If only we could analyse it and find out its
1957,true function. 
1958,SONDERGAARD: The equipment here's too primitive for crystallography.
1959,There's only one place.

2092,"KY: You will never win, Marshal. You will never take over this planet."
2093,"As long as one of my people remains alive, you will never be safe. My"
2094,death is unimportant. It will only help our fight for freedom. There
2095,will be others after me.

2099,"JAEGER: No good! The whole operation ruined, Marshal, thanks to you! "
2100,"MARSHAL: Later, Jaeger. I am busy! "
2101,JAEGER: I see! So tell them to get out! This is far more important! 
2102,"MARSHAL: Jaeger, I am warning you. "
2103,"JAEGER: Marshal, do you want to know what's happened to Solos or are"
2104,you too busy playing soldiers? 
2105,"MARSHAL: Guards, wait outside. You'll forgive a short postponement, I"
2106,trust? 
2107,JAEGER: Here are the figures. Total failure! Every one of those rockets
2108,malfunctioned in one way or another. If they had been properly checked
2109,"out as I insisted, Marshal. "
2110,"MARSHAL: Jaeger, what happened? "
2111,JAEGER: I'll tell you what happened. None of the ionisation rockets
2112,exploded in the atmosphere. Every single one hit the surface! 
2113,MARSHAL: So? 
2114,"JAEGER: So? Instead of seeding the atmosphere with ionisation crystals,"
2115,the planet's surface itself has been contaminated. You've made yourself
2116,"master of a desert, Marshal. A lethal desert. No one will be able to"
2117,"set foot on Solos for centuries now, once the crystals have taken"
2118,effect. No one! Not you and certainly not the Investigator! 
2119,"MARSHAL: Jaeger, will you shut up! "
2120,"JAEGER: As for this display of megalomania, how do you hope to conceal"
2121,it from the Investigator? They are not all of them as loyal as those
2122,"guards. Someone will talk, if only to save his own skin. "
2123,"MARSHAL: Someone like you, Jaeger? "
2124,"JO: Jaeger's right, you know? Someone will talk. "
2125,MARSHAL: And I dispose of you all first? 
2126,"STUBBS: You can't silence the whole of Skybase. You've got a problem,"
2127,Marshal. None of the men want to stay here. 
2128,MARSHAL: My men do as I tell them. 
2129,"STUBBS: That's not true, Marshal. Cotton and I aren't the only ones,"
2130,you know. 
2131,JO: The Investigator's going to find out everything. The Administrator
2132,"assassinated, native leaders dead or missing and a contaminated planet."
2133,"Now that's not a very successful record, is it, Marshal? "
2134,"MARSHAL: Very good, Miss Grant. Very convincing. You forget one thing."
2135,"The Investigator still has to get here, and his ship is no match for"
2136,Skybase. 
2137,"STUBBS: Agreed, you could dispose of the Investigator too. But how"
2138,"reliable are your rockets, Professor? As for the advance warning"
2139,"system, the Doctor and Miss Grant landed, Marshal, landed without being"
2140,detected. And the Doctor's still free. 
2141,MARSHAL: Doctor! Always the Doctor! 
2142,"JO: But no one else can help you, or Solos for that matter. Do you"
2143,"think we didn't know about the Investigator? Well, why do you think we"
2144,were sent? He's coming to confirm the Doctor's findings. 
2145,MARSHAL: Where is your precious Doctor now? 
2146,"KY: He's on Solos, Marshal, with Sondergaard. And both of them are very"
2147,much alive.

2150,
2151, (The Doctor snaps a piece of dead shrubbery.) 
2152,SONDERGAARD: What's happening here? 
2153,DOCTOR: It's started already. Contamination from the ionisation
2154,"crystals. We've got to get out of here, Sondergaard. "
2155,SONDERGAARD: It's no good. I can't. You'll have to leave me. 
2156,"DOCTOR: My dear chap, I wouldn't hear of it. "
2157,"SONDERGAARD: You've got to get to that laboratory on Skybase, Doctor."
2158,You stand a better chance on your own. I'll be all right. I'll rest
2159,here for a while and then go back to the caves. I'll be safe there. Now
2160,"go, please. "
2161,"DOCTOR: Yes, all right. You take care, all right? "

2170,"MARSHAL: Oh, we shall, never fear. "
2171,"JAEGER: You see, Miss Grant, there's a technique known as particle"
2172,"reversal. We wish to use the Doctor's knowledge of this technique to,"
2173,"as it were, sweep the dust under the carpet before the Investigator"
2174,arrives.

2210,GUARD: And the other thing. 
2211,(The Doctor hands over his sonic screwdriver.) 
2212,"DOCTOR: Well, what do you want? "
2213,"MARSHAL: As you're no doubt aware, Jaeger's made a complete hash of my"
2214,plan to make the planet habitable. He seemed to think you could help
2215,him put it right. 
2216,DOCTOR: And if I do? 
2217,MARSHAL: Then you will live. Both of you. 
2218,DOCTOR: And if not? 
2219,"MARSHAL: Oh, come now, Doctor, surely you can guess. "
2220,"DOCTOR: Yes, only too easily. "
2221,MARSHAL: Then why the delay? It's not just their lives. The whole
2222,planet is at stake. 
2223,DOCTOR: Very well then.

2225,DOCTOR: Superior? 
2226,"MARSHAL: Yes, Earth Control has seen fit to have my project"
2227,investigated. I want my reforms to have their approval. You and your
2228,friends here will confirm the necessity of stern measures. Outbreaks of

2244,"JAEGER: It wasn't my decision, Doctor. "
2245,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. No, no, of course not. You were simply obeying orders."
2246,"That's a common excuse, Professor. Right, now I'll need a macrovisor."
2247,The strongest one you've got. 
2248,"JAEGER: Well, there's only one. "
2249,DOCTOR: The one you use in the transfer system? 
2250,"JAEGER: Yes, but you can't use that. "
2251,"DOCTOR: Well, we've got to use it. We'll have to train it on each"
2252,"affected area in turn, like a searchlight. "
2253,JAEGER: I thought you were going to use the particle reversal? 
2254,"DOCTOR: I am, Jaeger, I am. But we shall need the beam to transfer the"
2255,effect from this laboratory to the contaminated areas. 
2256,"JAEGER: Oh, I see. Er, why? "
2257,"DOCTOR: Well, we can hardly set it up on the surface of the planet now,"
2258,can we? You've seen to that. 
2259,JAEGER: I shall have to get the Marshal's authority. 
2260,DOCTOR: The Marshal's? 
2261,JAEGER: It's not going to be easy. It means isolating Skybase. 
2262,"DOCTOR: Look, for heaven's sake, stop dilly-dallying and let's get on"
2263,with it. These unstable reactions are dangerous. I shall need some

2291,"STUBBS: That's it, Miss. Contact the Investigator. "
2292,COTTON: We can use the Marshal's communicator.

2415,the Overlord's experiments with the air of Solos have made the mutation

2503,INVESTIGATOR: Your scientific advisor? 
2504,"MARSHAL: Well, surely you know one another? "
2505,INVESTIGATOR: Should we? 
2506,DOCTOR: Perhaps I can explain. 
2507,"INVESTIGATOR: Perhaps you can in due course. I've read your report,"
2508,"Marshal, and I should like to begin this enquiry, if I may, by"
2509,discussing certain matters arising from it. You have been accused of
2510,"some very serious crimes, Marshal. Well? "
2511,"MARSHAL: Well, Investigator, I'm sure you're aware that all Colony"
2512,Commanders are faced with accusations of this kind. 
2513,"INVESTIGATOR: Some, Marshal. Occasionally, the accusations are"
2514,justified. That is why I'm here. 
2515,"MARSHAL: Of course, of course. Of course you are. You see, Solos has"
2516,"been beset in recent months with problems. I mean, an upsurge of"
2517,"nationalism, outbreak of plague, constant and growing attacks and"
2518,"sabotage, culminating in the assassination of the Administrator by"
2519,terrorists on the eve of independence. It was at this point that I
2520,decided to impose martial law. 
2521,INVESTIGATOR: I see. How severe was this martial law? 
2522,"MARSHAL: Oh, rounding up of political suspects. "
2523,INVESTIGATOR: There's no report here of any trial being held. 
2524,"MARSHAL: Oh, the prisoners were allowed to escape. "
2525,"INVESTIGATOR: By, er, Stubbs and Cotton. "
2526,"MARSHAL: Er, yes. "
2527,INVESTIGATOR: Now deceased? 
2528,MARSHAL: Yes. 
2529,INVESTIGATOR: I see. Continue. 
2530,MARSHAL: I then took personal control of the operation and tracked
2531,these terrorists to their hideout in a disused mine area. 
2532,INVESTIGATOR: These would be thaesium mines? 
2533,"MARSHAL: Correct, correct. I ordered the area to be cordoned off and"
2534,the exits blown up. 
2535,INVESTIGATOR: And the natives inside? 
2536,"MARSHAL: Oh, they were Mutts. "
2537,INVESTIGATOR: Mutts? 
2538,DOCTOR: He means they were all plague victims. They use the caves as a
2539,refuge. 
2540,"MARSHAL: Yes, the terrorists took advantage of their unfortunate"
2541,compatriots. I had no alternative. 
2542,INVESTIGATOR: And presumably thousands died as a result of your
2543,actions? 
2544,"MARSHAL: Unfortunately, but their condition was incurable. I couldn't"
2545,allow this risk of the plague spreading. 
2546,INVESTIGATOR: Mutts you say? 
2547,"DOCTOR: Yes. Mutant natives, sir. It's a local term. Medically"
2548,"speaking, accelerated genetic metamorphosis. "
2549,"INVESTIGATOR: I see. You are a Doctor, I take it? "
2550,"DOCTOR: I am, yes. "
2551,INVESTIGATOR: Qualified in? 
2552,DOCTOR: Practically everything. 
2553,"INVESTIGATOR: Ah. Well, Doctor, do you agree with the Marshal's"
2554,diagnosis that the condition of these Mutts was incurable? 
2555,"DOCTOR: Yes, sir. Yes, I would."

2565,"JO: Okay. If we don't get out soon, it'll be too late. "
2566,COTTON: Stand back!

2608,involved in experiments to change this planet's natural atmosphere?

2610,INVESTIGATOR: The accusation is that you mounted a massive operation to
2611,"convert the atmosphere to one breathable by humans, but not by the"
2612,native population. 
2613,JAEGER: Nonsense. 
2614,"INVESTIGATOR: And further, that these experiments were the root cause"
2615,of the outbreak of mutation. Well? 
2616,JAEGER: I'm a scientist. 
2617,(The Doctor coughs.) 
2618,JAEGER: And I rest my case on scientific proof only. Your scientists
2619,have made their own tests. The atmosphere of Solos is exactly as it
2620,"always was. As for the Mutts, er, as for the mutants, I regret that so"
2621,far we have found no solution to the problem. 
2622,"INVESTIGATOR: Thank you, Professor, that will be all. "
2623,(The Investigator confers with his deputies.) 
2624,"INVESTIGATOR: Well, gentleman, we have heard the evidence. In the"

2626,exonerate you from blame

2681,MARSHAL: Where? Where is your proof?

2694,Investigator of our discoveries. 
2695,"SONDERGAARD: Oh, yes, of course. Well, I'm sure the Doctor will have"
2696,"told you of our work in the cave, and he will also have told you that"
2697,we now realise what's made so many of these mutations to go wrong.

2699,Why wrong? 
2700,"SONDERGAARD: Well, you see "
2701,MARSHAL: There you see? Even Sondergaard admits it. The mutants are
2702,evil! Must be destroyed! 
2703,"(Down on Solos, a mutant finally gets into a transfer cubicle and"
2704,activates it. Up on Skybase it goes off looking for Sondergaard.) 
2705,SONDERGAARD: I beg not to listen to this man. The mutants are not
2706,"monsters. They are the native life form of this planet, undergoing a"
2707,"natural and inevitable change. This change, however, has been brought"
2708,about prematurely by that man's rash and callous experiments! 
2709,JAEGER: That's a lie! Where's your evidence? 
2710,(The mutant enters.) 
2711,MARSHAL: Mutts! 
2712,SONDERGAARD: No! There's nothing to be afraid of. The mutants are not
2713,dangerous unless you try to harm them. 
2714,MARSHAL: They're evil! Don't deserve to live! 
2715,SONDERGAARD: That is a rational and intelligent creature. To kill it
2716,would be murder! 
2717,MARSHAL: Destroy it or we'll all be killed! 
2718,KY: No! 
2719,"(Ky tries to grab a weapon but is knocked down. The mutant leaves, the"
2720,Marshal takes a weapon and fires at it.)
2721,
2722, [Outside the Marshal's office]
2723,
2724, (The Marshal guns down the mutant. The
2725,Investigator approaches.) 
2726,"MARSHAL: There, you see what I have to deal with? More of these"
2727,creatures may attack us. I want my men released at once. Now! And your
2728,men placed under my command. 
2729,(An ECS guard runs up.) 
2730,INVESTIGATOR: Release the Marshal's men. Obey his orders during this
2731,emergency. 
2732,MARSHAL: You others follow me.
2733,
2734, [Marshal's office]
2735,
2736,(Cotton is helping a suffering Ky.) 
2737,JAEGER: They've gone. 
2738,MARSHAL: What? Who? 
2739,"JAEGER: The Doctor, his assistant, Sondergaard. These two weren't quick"
2740,enough. 
2741,"MARSHAL: Right, after them. To the laboratory. Seal all exits. Take"
2742,these two to the radiation chamber. 
2743,"JAEGER: But what about the radiation level? After refuelling, it'll be"
2744,much higher than 
2745,"MARSHAL: That's their problem, isn't it? Take them away."
2746,
2747, [Skybase One Laboratory]
2748,
2749," DOCTOR: Jo, take this key. Lock the door. "
2750,JO: Right. 
2751,"SONDERGAARD: Doctor, the crystal, the one you found in the cave. You"
2752,have it still? 
2753,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, of course. "
2754,"(The Doctor takes it from his cape, still hanging over the railing.) "
2755,"DOCTOR: Yes. Now, all we've got to do is analyse its structure. "
2756,SONDERGAARD: But that would take hours. 
2757,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, we haven't got hours, but we do have this. It will"
2758,"help me to accelerate the process, I think. "
2759,(The Doctor attaches the crystal to the particle reverser.) 
2760,"JO: Well, quickly, Doctor! "
2761,"DOCTOR: I'm being as quick as I can, Jo. "
2762,(The crystal glows brightly.) 
2763,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Of course! The crystal acts as a bio-catalytic"
2764,"agent. Sondergaard, take this crystal to Ky immediately. But what about"
2765,the thaesium radiation? Surely that's the vital part of the process? 
2766,"JO: Well, there's thaesium radiation in the chamber where they took us."
2767,Cotton told me. 
2768,"DOCTOR: Well, what else can we do? We must try it. If we hope to"
2769,"achieve a successful mutation, that is. "
2770,(The door lock blows up and the Marshal enters with guards.) 
2771,"MARSHAL: Get away from that machine, Doctor. Guards, take that girl and"
2772,Sondergaard to the radiation chamber. 
2773,"DOCTOR: So, you've managed to wriggle out of trouble, have you? "
2774,"MARSHAL: I am once more in full control of Skybase, Doctor. A fact you"
2775,would do well to remember. 
2776,"DOCTOR: Congratulations. Well, what do you want now? "
2777,"MARSHAL: An Earth type atmosphere on Solos. Nothing more, nothing less."
2778,Your friends will be confined to the radiation chamber while you work.
2779,"I am afraid the radiation is at a dangerously high level at the moment,"
2780,"so you'd better hurry, Doctor."
2781,
2782, [Skybase One]
2783,
2784," (Ky is on the floor, twitching. Sondergaard and Jo"
2785,are pushed in through the hatch.) 
2786,"COTTON: I'm afraid Ky's just about had it, Miss. "
2787,SONDERGAARD: How long has he been like this? 
2788,COTTON: It started as soon as we got in here. The first dose didn't do
2789,him any good. Now this lot on top. 
2790,"SONDERGAARD: The first dose? Oh yes, you were confined here before,"
2791,"weren't you? Well, we'll have to hurry. We may already be too late. "
2792,(Sondergaard places the crystal in Ky's hands.) 
2793,COTTON: Now what? 
2794,SONDERGAARD: We wait. 
2795,COTTON: We can't wait too long. 
2796,(Ky thrashes about suddenly.) 
2797,JO: Ky! 
2798,"SONDERGAARD: No, no, leave him. "
2799,"JO: Look, he's changing. "
2800,"(Ky mutates very quickly, before their eyes.)"
2801,
2802, [Skybase One Laboratory]
2803,
2804,(Jaeger enters.) 
2805,"MARSHAL: Watch him, Jaeger. That's about all you're good for, so watch"
2806,him like a hawk. 
2807,(The Doctor works on the particle reversal equipment. The Investigator
2808,enters.) 
2809,INVESTIGATOR: Marshal! 
2810,(Jaeger turns to look and the Doctor switches a couple of leads over.) 
2811,MARSHAL: Investigator. 
2812,INVESTIGATOR: Why have my men been disarmed and confined to their
2813,quarters? What is this nonsense about my ship not being allowed to
2814,leave Skybase? 
2815,"MARSHAL: Oh, no nonsense, Investigator. I'm sure you and your crew will"
2816,enjoy your stay on Solos. 
2817,INVESTIGATOR: Solos? 
2818,"MARSHAL: Yes, as soon as our good friend the Doctor here has finished"
2819,"his twiddling, Solos will find itself with a new atmosphere. You and"
2820,the others will be the first settlers on New Earth. 
2821,"INVESTIGATOR: And you, Marshal? "
2822,MARSHAL: I shall rule from Skybase. 
2823,INVESTIGATOR: You will never be allowed 
2824,"MARSHAL: Oh, come now. You didn't think I'd let you return to Earth"
2825,Council? An accident will be reported. Lost with all hands I believe is
2826,the phrase. 
2827,INVESTIGATOR: Other ships will come from Earth. 
2828,"MARSHAL: Oh, they'll be room for them. You should be grateful to help"
2829,"me. We'll begin a new Earth, the centre of a new empire. "
2830,"DOCTOR: It's all right, Investigator. He's quite mad. "
2831,"MARSHAL: Oh no, Doctor. I told you. Madmen lose. I've won. Solos is"
2832,mine. Have you finished your work? 
2833,DOCTOR: Almost. And my companions? 
2834,MARSHAL: Will be released as soon as the job is done.
2835,
2836, [Radiation chamber]
2837,
2838, (The mutated Ky is glowing.) 
2839,JO: Why is he drawing all the radiation? 
2840,"SONDERGAARD: I don't know, my child. We can only watch and hope. "
2841,(There is a bright flash and a beautiful person in long flowing robes
2842,"emerges from the chrysalis, a rainbow of colours drifting over him.) "
2843,"SONDERGAARD: It worked. Thank heavens, it worked! "
2844,COTTON: Worked? 
2845,SONDERGAARD: Yes. 
2846,"JO: Ky? Ky, can you hear me? "
2847,(Ky is now a telepath.) 
2848,KY : I hear you. 
2849,"SONDERGAARD: It's thought transference. That's wonderful, wonderful! "
2850,"COTTON: Yeah, marvellous. But can he get us out? "
2851,"KY : There is little I cannot do now. Ky thanks you, Professor"
2852,Sondergaard. You have saved my people. You have shown the way. Goodbye.
2853,
2854,(Ky floats out through the wall.) 
2855,JO: Ky! 
2856,"COTTON: Goodbye? Great, innit? He just flashes off and leaves us here. "
2857,(The entry hatch swings open.) 
2858,"SONDERGAARD: Out, quickly. Help Miss Grant. "
2859,(Ascended Ky floats through Skybase. He waves his arms as he passes two
2860,guards and they collapse.)
2861,
2862, [Skybase One laboratory]
2863,
2864," (The Marshal is guarding Jaeger, the Doctor and"
2865,the Investigator on his own.) 
2866,MARSHAL: Are we ready? 
2867,DOCTOR: Yes. 
2868,MARSHAL: Very well. 
2869,(The Doctor goes over to the atmosphere control machine.) 
2870,"DOCTOR: You do realise, Marshal, that you're about to destroy a life"
2871,form unique in the history of the universe? 
2872,"MARSHAL: Hurry, Doctor, hurry. "
2873,DOCTOR: As you wish. 
2874,MARSHAL: Wait. 
2875,"DOCTOR: Change of heart, Marshal? "
2876,MARSHAL: I still don't trust you. Jaeger? 
2877,(Jaeger takes the Doctor's place at the controls. The Doctor leads the
2878,"Investigator back to a safer distance. At the Marshal's nod, Jaeger"
2879,switches on. Smoke then flames start to come out of the machine.) 
2880,MARSHAL: Jaeger! Stop it! 
2881,JAEGER: I can't! It's overloading! 
2882,DOCTOR: Get down. 
2883,"(The machine explodes, killing Jaeger.) "
2884,"DOCTOR: Right, out! "
2885,(The Doctor and the Investigator head for the door.) 
2886,"MARSHAL: Doctor, you have destroyed my dreams! I'll destroy you! "
2887,"(Ky appears, standing over the particle reverser.) "
2888,"KY : Die, Marshal. Let there be an end to your torture of my"
2889,people. 
2890,"(Ky sends a beam of energy to the Marshal, who vapourises.) "
2891,"KY : I thank you, Doctor, for all my people. Goodbye. "
2892,(Ky vanishes.)
2893,
2894, [Marshal's office]
2895,
2896, DOCTOR: Professor Sondergaard has agreed to stay
2897,on Solos and see as many of the Solonians as possible through to the
2898,stage that Ky has already achieved. 
2899,"JO: But what about the others, the mutants we saw in the caves? "
2900,"DOCTOR: They were premature mutations, Jo. The cycle of changes was"
2901,triggered off too soon. Rather like butterflies that hatch out on a
2902,cold spring day. Their instincts were too confused to seek out and use
2903,the crystal. 
2904,JO: And now you think you'll be able to help them? 
2905,"SONDERGAARD: Oh yes, we think so. Ky is on Solos now and, with the"
2906,"crystal, we hope we can save them. "
2907,"JO: And what are you going to do, Cotton? "
2908,COTTON: Give Ky and Professor Sondergaard all the help I can. Try and
2909,"clear up some of the mess the Marshal made. Then, do something we"
2910,should have all done a long time ago. 
2911,JO: What's that? 
2912,"COTTON: Go home, Miss. Back to Earth. "
2913,"INVESTIGATOR: Exactly. Cotton, you will assume acting command of this"
2914,"base, pending its return to Earth. "
2915,COTTON: Sir. 
2916,INVESTIGATOR: I take it you will be returning in Hyperion with me? I
2917,still require a full account of your involvement in this affair. 
2918,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, of course, but I wonder whether you'd excuse us for"
2919,"the moment, Investigator? My assistant is feeling rather faint. "
2920,"JO: Who, me? No, I'm fine now, honestly. I didn't feel too good"
2921,"earlier, but "
2922,"DOCTOR: No, Jo, no you have been rather overdoing it, you know, and you"
2923,
2924,JO: I have? 
2925,DOCTOR: You don't look too well. 
2926,JO: Really? 
2927,"DOCTOR: Come on. Will you excuse us? We'll see you all, later. "
2928,(The Doctor and Jo leave.)

2936,JO: Oh! 
2937,(But this door will not open to his palm print.) 
2938,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. They've locked it again. "
2939,JO: More breaking and entering? 
2940,(Jo holds up the sonic screwdriver.) 
2941,DOCTOR: Give me that. 
2942,(A quick buzz and the door opens.) 
2943,"JO: Oh well, back to the broom cupboard. "
2944,"DOCTOR: Yes, well at least we've made a clean sweep of this place. (Jo winces) No? "
2945,"(Chuckling, they enter the storage room. A klaxon sounds.) "
2946,MAN : Attention! Attention! Computer confirms malfunction in
2947,"storage area four. Investigate, please. Investigate, please. "
