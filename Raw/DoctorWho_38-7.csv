21,RAKAYA : Can you hear me?
22,
23,"[Aleppo, Syria 1380]"
24,
25,"(A fortified citadel stabds on the only high land, linked to the sprawling town by a single viaduct. Down below, in the town...) "
26,MAN : Thief! 
27,(A girl knocks on a door. A panel in the door slides open.) 
28,TAHIRA: Let me back in. 
29,MARYAM: How did you get out there? 
30,TAHIRA: Seeing a friend. 
31,MAN : I'll chop your hand off! 
32,"TAHIRA: I say friend. We're not that close. Please, let me back in. Please, let me back in, fast. "
33,(She is let into the courtyard. A little later -) 
34,MARYAM: You can't keep stealing from merchants in the souk. They know where you're from. 
35,TAHIRA: You tell me creating happiness is important to my mental wellbeing. A game like this makes me happy. 
36,MARYAM: Time to go back in your room. It'll be dark soon. 
37,TAHIRA: Have you taken precautions? Have you told everyone? 
38,MARYAM: Tahira. 
39,TAHIRA: We have to keep everyone safe. 
40,"MARYAM: Nothing is going to happen, Tahira. "
41,TAHIRA: Of course it is. I told you to tell them. I told the doctors. I told all of you. They're real. 
42,MARYAM: I understand they seem real to you. You need to rest. Sleep will help. 
43,TAHIRA: Sleep is when they'll come. I can feel them coming. They'll be here tonight. 
44,"MARYAM: Rest well, Tahira. "
45,(Night time.) 
46,TAHIRA: Maryam. Maryam. 
47,MARYAM: Over here. 
48,TAHIRA: I told you to lock the doors. 
49,MARYAM: We don't do that. 
50,TAHIRA: Get everyone out. 
51,(Something large snarls in the dark.) 
52,TAHIRA: Oh no. I tried to warn you. 
53,(A very large claw with half-metre long nails wraps around Maryam's face.) 
54,TAHIRA: Don't struggle. They like it more when you struggle. 
55,"(The being's roar makes Tahira's headdress blow backwards. Lamps fall, people scream, shadows run. Heavy footsteps approach "
56,Tahira and a set of massive canine teeth are inches from her face.) 
57,TAHIRA: Oh!
58,
59,"[Park Hill, Sheffield]"
60,
61,(The Tardis materialises outside the block of flats where the Khan's live.) 
62,"DOCTOR : Here we are, Sheffield. "
63,YASMIN : Is it the right day? 
64,
65,[Tardis]
66,
67,DOCTOR: It's the right day.  
68,YASMIN: In the right year? 
69,"DOCTOR: The day you asked, in the year that you asked, at the time that you asked. You are home. Everyone meet back here tomorrow lunchtime? "
70,GRAHAM: Yeah. 
71,RYAN: Yeah. What are you going to do? 
72,"DOCTOR: Me? Oh, yeah. Very busy. Busy, busy. Maintenance. Correspondence. Correspondence about maintenance. "
73,(The console burbles.) 
74,"DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, okay, not the exact right time. 77 minutes out. Late. "
75,YASMIN: What? 
76,(She rushes out.) 
77,GRAHAM: You sure you're gonna be all right on your own?  
78,"DOCTOR: Ah, yeah. Finally a bit of peace and quiet. "
79,(The Tardis door closes.) 
80,"DOCTOR: Hmm. I could always... Oh, nah. Maybe I'll just nip straight to tomorrow lunchtime. "
81,(The Tardis goes dark and a snarl is heard.) 
82,DOCTOR: What was that? 
83,"(A humanoid male figure appears, then dissipates again. The lights come back on. Alarms sound.) "
84,DOCTOR: Location for that noise. Aleppo? I've got time. 
85,(The Tardis dematerialises.)
86,
87,[Khan flat]
88,
89,"YASMIN: Sorry, sorry. Am I late? It is the right day, isn't it? Have you been waiting long? Am I really late? "
90,"SONYA: Yes, yes, yes and yes. Mum and Dad left hours ago. Whitby for the night. "
91,YASMIN: Did you cook? Can you cook now? 
92,(Sonya hugs her.) 
93,"SONYA: Hi, loser. "
94,"YASMIN: Hey, no-mark. "
95,
96,[Tipo's flat]
97,
98,"(Ryan knocks on the door. Several bolts are undone, along with a chain.) "
99,"TIBO: What are you doing here, man? "
100,"RYAN: I got your messages, didn't I? "
101,TIBO: It's been months.  
102,"RYAN: Yeah, me phone's been playing up. "
103,"TIBO: So... so, are you back?  "
104,"RYAN: Yeah, sort of. Not really. Just a few hours. I bought chips. You going to let me in or what? "
105,TIBO: It's not a good time. 
106,"RYAN: I got chips, though! "
107,"(Tibo lets him in, then secures the door with the chain and bolts again.)"
108,
109,[Graham's home]
110,
111,"GRAHAM: And that, gentlemen, is a full house.  "
112,GABRIEL: What? 
113,"GRAHAM: Well, I've been practising, haven't I? On my travels, eh? I've got to say, it's great to see you, lads. It don't sound like I've been missing much, though. "
114,GABRIEL: Nothin' at all. I'd rather be on cruises like you. 
115,"GRAHAM: Well, let me tell you, Gabe, those boats, mate, they are lovely, very calm. "
116,"FRED: And how's your health now, Gra? All right? "
117,"GRAHAM: Good, Freddie boy, thanks. Very good. "
118,GABRIEL: How are you coping... without Grace? 
119,"GRAHAM: Well, I have to, don't I? You know. Travelling helps, mate, dunnit? Stops me getting stuck in the past."
120,
121,[Bimaristan]
122,
123,"(The Tardis materialises at night in the courtyard. The place is a mess, plant pots toppled over.) "
124,"DOCTOR: Ah. Aleppo. 1380. Welcome to Syria. Now... Ah. They're not here, are they. "
125,(She looks at an engraving on the central water feature.) 
126,"DOCTOR: Bimaristan. It means sick place. This must be one of the oldest hospitals in the world. Of course, Islamic physicians "
127,were known for the enlightened way they treated people with mental health problems. But what happened here? You guys go this way... 
128,Oh! Who am I supposed to share all the interesting stuff with? 
129,TAHIRA : Is someone there? 
130,DOCTOR: Friendly visitors. Visitor. Where are you? I'm coming to say hello. 
131,(She follows the sound of sobbing.) 
132,DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. I'm here to help. 
133,(She goes down corridors to a room.) 
134,TAHIRA: Stay away! 
135,"DOCTOR: It's all right. You're safe, I promise. "
136,"TAHIRA: No, they took everyone. "
137,DOCTOR: What happened here? 
138,TAHIRA: You have to get out! 
139,DOCTOR: Why? 
140,TAHIRA: Because there's one still here. 
141,"(And it is up by the ceiling, with its giant claws on either wall. It roars, then drops to the floor.) "
142,DOCTOR: What are you?  
143,TAHIRA: Leave her alone! 
144,(The being roars at the Doctor and leaves.) 
145,DOCTOR: Stay here! 
146,(Out in the corridor.) 
147,DOCTOR: Gone. That was fast. 
148,(She scans with the sonic screwdriver.) 
149,DOCTOR: Nothing. Nothing at all.
150,
151,[Graham's home]
152,
153,"GRAHAM: Right, lads, ready? Here we go. Fastest dealer in south Yorkshire. "
154,"(Graham gets a vision of a white-haired, blue eyed woman. She is chained up.) "
155,"RAKAYA: Can you see? Can you see it? I'm trapped. This is what he did to me. Help me, Graham. He's close. "
156,(The vision ends.) 
157,FRED: I think you lost count. 
158,GRAHAM: Huh?
159,
160,[Tibo's flat]
161,
162,(Playing a FIFA video game on the television.) 
163,"RYAN: Goes past one. Goes past two. It's a screamer! Top bins, final seconds. He's done it. He's a lege. Ryan Sinclair, FIFA legend. I've never lost it. "
164,Oh! I've still got it. I'll make the tea. 
165,(The kitchen is a wreck of stuff not washed up or cleared away. Same for the table.) 
166,RYAN: Your place is normally spotless. This ain't you. 
167,"TIBO: Mate, you ain't been around, so don't tell me what I am. "
168,"RYAN: All right. Mate, sorry for not answering your messages. But you ain't yourself. "
169,TIBO: I'm just finding things difficult at the moment. 
170,RYAN: Have you spoken to anyone about it? 
171,"TIBO: No, and I'm not going to.  "
172,RYAN: All right.  
173,TIBO: There's something else. Promise you won't laugh at me. 
174,"RYAN: I can't promise that, can I? "
175,"TIBO: Last few days... I've been having nightmares. Dark, messed up stuff. And there's this... bloke in them. He keeps recurring, like he's watching my dreams, waiting in the dark. "
176,"RYAN: Oh, that's creepy. "
177,"TIBO: That's not the mad bit. But the past few days... I've seen him. At night. Outside the flat, across the hall. In my room. "
178,RYAN: The guy that's in your dreams is in your room? 
179,TIBO: I knew you'd laugh. 
180,"RYAN: Look at me. I'm not laughing. Mate, I've seen some weird things while I've been away. Things you wouldn't believe were possible. "
181,TIBO: Would you kip here tonight?
182,
183,[Khan flat]
184,
185,(Sitting down for a meal.) 
186,"SONYA: So, can you say where you've been, where they sent you? "
187,YASMIN: Madagascar. California. Hong Kong. Gloucester. 
188,SONYA: Oh! They had a thing in Gloucester. Dad was going on about it. Something to do with Russians. 
189,YASMIN: It had nowt to do with Russians. How's the new job?  
190,SONYA: Sacked. 
191,YASMIN: Sonya. 
192,SONYA: What? 
193,YASMIN: That's the third time.  
194,"SONYA: People are really annoying, and they hate being told that. I'm just not cut out for customer services. "
195,"YASMIN: No kidding. Sonya, we can stop doing this. Stop marking it. "
196,SONYA: I thought it was a good thing. 
197,"YASMIN: Yeah. No, I just dunno whether an anniversary dinner... "
198,SONYA: I still think about it. Do you? 
199,YASMIN: I dream about it sometimes. Sofa movie after? 
200,"SONYA: What, so you can fall asleep halfway through? "
201,YASMIN: I do not do that. 
202,"(Later, Yasmin is asleep while movie music plays.) "
203,SONYA: Idiot. 
204,SONYA [memory]: Hi. I didn't know who to call. We need help. 
205,(Yasmin is dreaming. A policewoman and car are on a long straight road in the middle of nowhere. Behind her is a young girl. Yasmin wakes with a start. 
206,The film has long finished. The man from the Tardis is standing there.) 
207,YASMIN: Who are you? What are you doing here? 
208,"(He disappears in a puff of smoke, again.)"
209,
210,[Tibo's flat]
211,
212,"(Ryan is sleeping on the sofa. It is 0430h. The man pops into Tibo's bedroom, the fingers detach from his left hand and one jams itself into Tibo's ear. "
213,Ryan wakes up. The finger has turned translucent and is sucking stuff out of Tibo's brain. The fingers then reappear on the man's hand.) 
214,RYAN: What are you doing? Hey! 
215,(The man and Tibo both vanish.) 
216,RYAN: Tibo!
217,
218,[Bismaristan]
219,
220,DOCTOR: What is your name? 
221,TAHIRA: Tahira. 
222,"DOCTOR: Have you seen those creatures before, Tahira? "
223,"TAHIRA: Not really. Who are you? I've never seen you here before, Doctor. "
224,"DOCTOR: Well, my brief is quite wide-ranging. No signs of those creatures outside the Bimaristan, so deliberately targeting a hospital of vulnerable people. "
225,TAHIRA: The place is silent. Where is everyone else? 
226,DOCTOR: How many people were here? 
227,TAHIRA: Maybe ten or twelve patients. 
228,"DOCTOR: I'm really sorry, but I think those creatures must have taken them. "
229,TAHIRA: Taken them where? 
230,"DOCTOR: I've no idea. And why they left you behind. How long have you been here, if it's not a personal question, which it is. "
231,TAHIRA: A few weeks. I've travelled a long way. Seen a lot of things I wish I hadn't. My family were killed when I was seven. I ran. Aleppo was safety for me. 
232,They let me in here because I wasn't doing well. 
233,DOCTOR: I promise to keep you safe. We will work this out. 
234,(Her phone rings.) 
235,DOCTOR: Ah! Really sorry. Message device. Someone's trying to get in touch. Just in 14th-century Syria. Is it lunchtime tomorrow already? 
236,
237,[Tibo's flat / Bismaristan / Khan flat / Graham's home]
238,
239,RYAN: I need your help. Me mate's been taken. 
240,DOCTOR: What? Wait. Another call. Yaz?  
241,"YASMIN: Doctor, there was a figure in our flat. "
242,"DOCTOR: Oh, hold on. Ah. Graham? "
243,"GRAHAM: Hey, Doc, I keep seeing these images of planets, like they're being projected into my head. "
244,"DOCTOR: Hmm. Hold on. (sonicks the phone) Call merge. I'm coming to get you all now, and I'm bringing my new friend Tahira. "
245,ALL: Who? 
246,
247,[Bismaristan]
248,
249,DOCTOR: I'll be there in a sec. Oh! 
250,(There's a hair in a scrape in the stonework.) 
251,DOCTOR: They did leave something behind. I knew it. This'll tell us something. Come on. I'll explain on the way. And it might just blow your mind.
252,
253,[Tardis]
254,
255,"DOCTOR: Tahira, this is Ryan, Graham and Yaz. "
256,YASMIN: Hi. 
257,"DOCTOR: Tahira is from Aleppo, in 1380. I've explained about the Tardis and the fact that you're from 700 years in the future. "
258,TAHIRA: I'm really not ready for today. 
259,(The Doctor is inspecting the hair. The Tardis wibbles.) 
260,"DOCTOR: No, don't tell me that, cos you're wrong. (wibble) I'm telling you, you are. "
261,TAHIRA: Who's she arguing with?  
262,"DOCTOR: The Tardis. Because it's telling me, quite defiantly, that these two strands of fur do not exist, when they're right there. "
263,"Those creatures that we saw aren't registered in its database. They've never existed, will never exist. Except they must. "
264,"Because if they don't exist, if they can't exist, where did they come from and how? Tell me what happened to your mate. "
265,"RYAN: Some guy was in his room. I dunno how he got in there. And it was like his fingers were detached from his hand, "
266,"connected to Tibo's ear, and it was draining something from him. "
267,YASMIN: What did he look like? 
268,RYAN: He was bald and... tattooed head. 
269,YASMIN: Whoa. Same bloke that was in the flat. 
270,"DOCTOR: And you, the psychic incursion in your head. Someone trying to communicate with you. "
271,"GRAHAM: Yeah, but it was a woman. She was trapped inside this er... I don't know, I couldn't make head nor tail of it. "
272,"Then I saw these, er, like, planets. They were burning, like she was connected to 'em somehow. "
273,DOCTOR: Someone's targeting us. Do you have any idea where those planets might be? 
274,"GRAHAM: You get me an A to Z of the universe, and I'll be able to stick my finger straight on... No, I've got no idea. "
275,"DOCTOR: Right then, better idea. Tardis telepathic circuits. "
276,"(Graham has a headset on now. It didn't used to be such a faff, you just put your fingers into the relevant bit of the console.) "
277,GRAHAM: Doc... 
278,"DOCTOR: Stop fidgeting, will you? "
279,GRAHAM: Ah! Doc... Ow! I don't like it. Are you sure it's safe? 
280,"DOCTOR: You trust me, don't you? "
281,GRAHAM: Have I got to answer that? 
282,DOCTOR: Oi. 
283,GRAHAM: Is it going to hurt? 
284,DOCTOR: No. Probably not. Maybe. Yeah. Ready?  
285,GRAHAM: No! 
286,DOCTOR: Focus on the image. 
287,GRAHAM: Whoa! Ouch! 
288,(Sparks and smoke from the console.) 
289,"DOCTOR: Ah, we found something. We're moving. But where?"
290,
291,[Space station]
292,
293,"(Asteroid belt, diamond shaped space station. The Tardis materialises.) "
294,"DOCTOR: Deep space, distant future. Is this what you saw? "
295,"GRAHAM: No, nothing like this. "
296,DOCTOR: Then why here? What did the telepathic circuits lock on to? 
297,"RYAN: If they were hooked into your mind, no wonder we're somewhere dark and weird.  "
298,GRAHAM: Oi! 
299,YASMIN: Do you even know where we are? 
300,"DOCTOR: Half a galaxy past the Geskon Straits. Very little out here. No civilisations left by now. It doesn't feel like a ship, though. "
301,"We're in geostationary orbit, and that would be deliberate, so why here? "
302,TAHIRA: Are we underground? Is that why it's so dark? 
303,"YASMIN: The Doctor reckons we're in a building, among the stars. We've come a long way from home. "
304,TAHIRA: That's impossible. Nobody can travel across the stars. 
305,YASMIN: Unless you're the Doctor. She's basically the definition of impossible. 
306,(Some lights come on.) 
307,DOCTOR: Oh! Control hub? Operator activated. 
308,(A screen comes on.) 
309,"GRAHAM: Oh, now you've got something there, Doc. "
310,"DOCTOR: Yeah, but what?  "
311,"GRAHAM: There, look. That is exactly what I saw, those two objects. "
312,"DOCTOR: This must be a monitor platform, observing events in this part of the solar system. "
313,"RYAN: What are they, like, planets? Looks like they're falling into each other. "
314,"DOCTOR: Colliding. About to destroy each other. It's an extinction event. But they're not colliding, and they should be. "
315,"What's stopping the final collapse? Best take a little zoom in. Whoa! There's something there, between those planets. "
316,RYAN: What sort of something? 
317,DOCTOR: (zooming in further) Good question. Whoa! The engineering required to create that and keep it in place. Bravo. 
318,Whoever built that - round of applause from me. 
319,"GRAHAM: Doc, can... can... can you magnify, like, zoom in? "
320,DOCTOR: Why? 
321,"GRAHAM: Well, I think there's more to see. "
322,DOCTOR: A tiny geo orb locked in place. 
323,RYAN: Is there someone in there? 
324,RAKAYA [memory]: Are you here? Is it you? 
325,"GRAHAM: Tha... that's it. She's trapped. That's... that's what I saw. Doc, we... we gotta help her out. "
326,RAKAYA [memory]: Please. 
327,"YASMIN: Hey, have you seen this? This whole section is covered in fingers. "
328,DOCTOR: What? Covered in fingers?  
329,(She runs over and scans with the sonic.) 
330,"DOCTOR: And there's a signal coming from them... broadcasting into that orb, to that girl.  "
331,RAKAYA : I'm trapped. 
332,DOCTOR: A psychic signal fed by all this. But what is it? 
333,(A device lowers from the ceiling. A sort of tripod with a globe on top.) 
334,DOCTOR: Ah! This place has so many secrets to yield. 
335,RYAN: What do you reckon you've got there? 
336,"DOCTOR: This tech is powering this platform, powering that orb, keeping it in place between those two planets. "
337,"And at its heart, a quantum fluctuation lock. A sequence of changing combinations, hundreds of billions of combinations every millisecond, "
338,"which would mean that orb... is a prison, and she's locked in there, fed by that signal. A signal of what, though? "
339,YASMIN: Where's Tahira? 
340,"(Tahira has wandered off to another area, where people are held with their hands fastened above their heads.) "
341,TAHIRA: Maryam. 
342,"(The being is also there, behind a screen. And the man.) "
343,"ZELLIN: Do you recognise them? The Chagaskas. Your worst fears, my creativity. "
344,"RYAN : There she is. Oi, freak hands, get away from her. "
345,"YASMIN: Plus, you can release all of these people right now. And don't you ever come sneaking back into my family's flat. "
346,(Zellin's fingers part from his palm.) 
347,"GRAHAM: Oh, that's not good. "
348,(And fly towards them.)
349,
350,[Yasmin's dream]
351,
352,(Yasmin is back on her long lonely road.) 
353,"SONYA: Do it right this time. I won't be calling anyone. No point. You're weak. You run. Nobody's coming, Yaz.  "
354,"(The policewoman is there, standing by her car.) "
355,SONYA: You're alone in the dark. 
356,"YASMIN: Oh, no. Sonya! "
357,"(Yasmin now is totally alone, then revealed to be unconscious in one of the cubicles with her hands shackled above her head. Next along is Ryan.)"
358,
359,[Ryan's dream]
360,
361,(Surrounded by flames. A white-haired man raises his head.) 
362,RYAN: Tibo? 
363,"OLD TIBO: Where you been, man? We waited for you. You said you'd be back. "
364,RYAN: How long you been waiting? 
365,OLD TIBO: Our whole lives. 
366,RYAN: What's with all the fire? 
367,OLD TIBO: The place is burning. 
368,RYAN: What place? 
369,OLD TIBO: Earth. And you weren't here. I thought we were mates. 
370,(Dregs from the Orphan 55 version of Earth growl at Ryan.)
371,
372,[Graham's dream]
373,
374,"(Sheffield City Hospital room, with an IV drip in his arm.) "
375,GRAHAM: Why am I hooked up to this? 
376,(A familiar woman turns around.) 
377,GRAHAM: Grace? 
378,"GRACE: I'm sorry to tell you, Mister O'Brien, your cancer's returned. "
379,"GRAHAM: What? Well, no, no, that... that can't be right. I've had a check-up. I, er... Anyway, you're not my doctor. "
380,GRACE: This time it's very aggressive. 
381,"GRAHAM: Well, how long have I got? "
382,GRACE: A couple of hours. Why didn't you save me? 
383,GRAHAM: Let me... let me try again.
384,
385,[Space station]
386,
387,"DOCTOR: Now, for most people, a quantum flux lock is unbreakable. 100 billion combinations every millisecond. But I've got an app for that. "
388,"One sonic, connected to the calculating power of one Tardis. Shouldn't take too long. And I'm talking to myself again, which means the others aren't here. "
389,"ZELLIN: Hello, Doctor. I've watched you stumbling round this universe. "
390,DOCTOR: I presume this is all your doing. Who's that girl in the orb? And where are my friends? Who are you? 
391,"ZELLIN: I go by many names. My preferred, my original, is Zellin. "
392,"DOCTOR: No. Zellin's a mythical name, way beyond this universe. Zellin was thought to be a god. "
393,ZELLIN: I blush. 
394,DOCTOR: You can't be. 
395,"ZELLIN: We immortals need our games, Doctor. Eternity is long, and we are cursed to see it all. The Eternals have their games, the Guardians have their power struggles. "
396,"For me, this dimension is a beautiful board for a game. The Toymaker would approve. And I do like this form. It's so small. To exist within molecules "
397,"and atoms is fascinating. I can shape them, regrow, mould my form to provoke fear from humans as I extract nightmares from the scared and vulnerable. "
398,"Now, that is a good game.  "
399,DOCTOR: Wait. Are you transmitting nightmares? Taking nightmares from humans and forcing them into the mind of a girl you've trapped between planets?  
400,"ZELLIN: I've seen many races, Doctor, and the humans are infinitely fascinating, infinitely pathetic. But of course you know that. We share the same obsession. "
401,DOCTOR: We are not the same. 
402,ZELLIN: No. You are so much lesser. You know the best part of humanity? The thing that truly sets them apart? The cruelty of their own minds 
403,"directed towards themselves. The doubt, the fear, the endless voices telling themselves that they're incapable and unworthy. Such an exquisite animal. "
404,"Built-in pain. And the repositories of that pain, the nightmares. "
405,(An alarm sounds.) 
406,"ZELLIN: I presume that's your doing, Doctor. Always interfering. I've watched you blunder into this. "
407,"DOCTOR: Blundering. Top of my CV, alongside plays well with others and excellent tap dancer in a crisis. "
408,ZELLIN: Almost clever. But not quite clever enough. 
409,"DOCTOR: You sure about that? Cos look, your prisoner, she's free. I used your own technology against you. "
410,"ZELLIN: No, Doctor. I used your instincts against you. "
411,DOCTOR: What? 
412,"ZELLIN: I made the Chagaskas, targeted the humans to entice you here. I needed someone from this realm to break a lock from this realm. "
413,Only one would do. You. 
414,DOCTOR: No. 
415,"ZELLIN: You did find the right answer, but you weren't asking the right questions. "
416,RAKAYA: My freedom! 
417,(Rakaya arrives in a swirl of black smoke.) 
418,"ZELLIN: This platform isn't my technology. I didn't make this prison. She was always the more powerful of us, the more dangerous. "
419,That's why they imprisoned her. I just... ride in her slipstream. 
420,RAKAYA: Release. After all this time. 
421,DOCTOR: I don't understand. 
422,RAKAYA: Let me make you. 
423,(Animation sequence showing what Rakaya describes.) 
424,"RAKAYA : Two creatures from another realm descended onto a universe, where they were worshipped as gods. They saw two planets and laid a wager. "
425,"Which of them could bring a planet to destruction first? The gods set to their game, sowing chaos through the populations. "
426,"Wars began, between species, then between the planets themselves. The gods delighted in the carnage. It passed the time. "
427,"But slowly, the inhabitants of the world grew wise, realised what these creatures had done to them. "
428,"They unified and fought back against their so-called gods. They set their own planets into a collision course and at the heart of the collision, "
429,"they laid a prison. They trapped one creature between the planets for eternity. The other fled, vowing to return to release his eternal partner. "
430,"ZELLIN : Wake up, Doctor. "
431,(The Doctor has joined the others in being shackled.) 
432,ZELLIN: Welcome back. I hope you understand now. I wasn't torturing her with nightmares. I was feeding her what she needed to stay sane. 
433,"The pain of others. But even gods need a helping hand, Doctor. Thank you. You won't feel a thing when this all burns. "
434,"RAKAYA: Yes, they will. "
435,ZELLIN: (laughs) Yes. Where now? 
436,RAKAYA: All those nightmares. I loved them. 
437,ZELLIN: Humans? 
438,RAKAYA: Earth. Let's take them all. 
439,ZELLIN: Yes. 
440,"(And they both vanish, leaving a finger behind in mid-air.) "
441,"DOCTOR: Oh, come on. "
442,(It flies towards her.)
443,
444,[Street]
445,
446,"(A man looks out of his window, and a woman passer-by turns to look at Zellin and Rakaya.) "
447,"RAKAYA: What do you think it feels like for them to be such tiny, ephemeral flashes of existence? "
448,ZELLIN: Hmm. 
449,RAKAYA: They feel so much. It must burn them. 
450,ZELLIN: I think it does.
451,
452,[The Doctor's dream]
453,
454,(Tranquillity Spa from Orphan 55. Again.) 
455,"MASTER : It's buried deep in all our memories, in our identity. Built on the lie of the Timeless Child."
456,
457,[Space station]
458,
459,"DOCTOR: Hmm. Right. Think this will hold me, do you? "
460,(She knocks the sonic screwdriver upwards from her inside pocket to her hands and activates it to release herself. She pulls a finger off her neck.) 
461,DOCTOR: Oh. Argh. Disgusting. 
462,(Then goes around freeing and waking everyone else.) 
463,GRAHAM: Ah! I have just had the maddest dream. 
464,"DOCTOR: I know, you all have. Tranquillising psycho-extraction. "
465,RYAN: I need to get Tibo. 
466,DOCTOR: We have to get everybody safe and back to their rightful place. 
467,"GRAHAM: Well, maybe if you stopped messing around with those finger things. "
468,DOCTOR: Tapped into the bio-organic code. The sonic does fingers. 
469,(She lets Yasmin's 'finger' go and it floats in the air.) 
470,DOCTOR: Down. Stay. Good dog. 
471,YASMIN:Ew! 
472,DOCTOR: Could be useful. 
473,"TIBO: Ryan, where am I? "
474,"RYAN: All right, mate, try not to freak out, yeah, but you're on a floating space platform in a gravitational pull between two colliding planets "
475,halfway across the universe cos of the guy who was stealing your nightmares through creepy detachable fingers. 
476,TIBO: Prank? 
477,RYAN: No. 
478,TIBO: Take me through that again. 
479,(The Chagaska roars.) 
480,RYAN: What are they? 
481,"DOCTOR: (to Tahira) I know why they didn't attack you. Because they're yours. Zellin, that man, created the Chagaska from your nightmares. "
482,"They wouldn't kill you, they couldn't, because you created them. So, how do you defeat two rampaging immortals? Answer, you don't. "
483,"Those two planets, they spent a millennia trying to work out how to do it. "
484,"GRAHAM: Well, I think the motivational speech needs a bit of work, Doc, if you don't... And also a plan, by the way. "
485,"DOCTOR: I've got plans crashing through my brain all the time. You want a plan? Come to me. Identifying which plan's going to work, that's the tricky bit. Ah!"
486,
487,[Street]
488,
489,"RAKAYA: This is perfect, Zellin. You've done well. "
490,ZELLIN: Take them all. 
491,RAKAYA: Hmm. 
492,ZELLIN: Billions in one go. Gorge on their fears. 
493,"RAKAYA: Why would we rush? We have so much time to walk in their nightmares. We can pass eternity here, if we take it slow. "
494,ZELLIN: Of course.
495,
496,[Bedroom]
497,
498,"MOTHER: I've told you, there are no bogeymen. Nothing to be worried about. Night, night. "
499,"(She leaves the boy, turns out the light and closes the door. Zellin appears.) "
500,ZELLIN: That's not true. 
501,(And does the finger thing. Streams of dark energy go into Rakaya out in the street.)
502,
503,[Street]
504,
505,(There is a roar. The energy transfer stops.) 
506,RAKAYA: What was that? 
507,ZELLIN: I manifested a creature from a human nightmare. It's calling across the Time waves. 
508,RAKAYA: A pet? I want to see.
509,
510,[Bismaristan]
511,
512,"DOCTOR: Oh, nice entrance. Welcome to Aleppo. Very beautiful city. "
513,ZELLIN: How are you here? 
514,"DOCTOR: I'm that little bit smarter than you thought I was. Now, listen to me. Earth is not your plaything. You're wrong about humans. They're not pathetic, "
515,"they're magnificent. They live with their fears, doubts, guilts. They face them down every day. and they prevail. That's not weakness. That's strength. "
516,"That's what humanity is. Isn't that right, Tahira? "
517,"TAHIRA: Yes, Doctor. "
518,DOCTOR: Why don't you show them how strong you are? 
519,(The Chagaska drops down inbetween the mortals and the immortals.) 
520,TAHIRA: My Chagaska. 
521,ZELLIN: How can you control it? 
522,YASMIN: Literally conquered her fear. 
523,RAKAYA: Are you confronting us? 
524,"DOCTOR: Yeah! You immortals. So entitled, so spoiled. You never clear up after yourselves. And you should be really careful what you leave lying around. "
525,"(Tibo hands her the energy globe, which she tosses in the air, and the ground shakes.) "
526,DOCTOR: Sorry. I won't do that again. Just returning your lost property. 
527,(She sonics up the fingers.) 
528,DOCTOR: Thanks for lending a helping hand. 
529,RYAN: Really? 
530,DOCTOR: I couldn't resist. What's your worst nightmare? 
531,(She sends the fingers onto Zellin and Rakaya.) 
532,"DOCTOR: Now, Tahira! "
533,"(The Chagaska grabs the immortals, and they end up in Rakaya's prison orb with it, screaming.) "
534,TAHIRA: You made my nightmares real. Now you can live with them for all eternity. 
535,"DOCTOR: Yes! Gods back in their box. We need to get this back to the monitor platform, and all those people out of the Tardis jacuzzi. Come on!"
536,
537,[Tibo's flat]
538,
539,TIBO: Slept like a baby last night. 
540,"RYAN: Good, cos you need all the beauty sleep you can get. "
541,TIBO: Oi. Man's still looking fresh. 
542,RYAN: Ooh. 
543,"TIBO: What, you'll be going again? "
544,RYAN: Yeah. 
545,TIBO: But you could've told me the truth about it all. 
546,RYAN: Would you have believed me? 
547,TIBO: Nope. It's a bit more than just the world you're seeing. Do you know when you'll be back? 
548,RYAN: Not sure. 
549,"TIBO: Well, don't make it too long. I need my best mate. I get a bit lost without him. "
550,"RYAN: Yeah, I get that, too. Look, I've been looking at something that might help, for my mate, and there's something I need you to do for me, and you can't argue."
551,
552,[Group session]
553,
554,"TIBO: I get down, and I shut myself off. And it's like I'm paralysed with it for days, weeks. It's in control of me. And I thought I'd try and do something about it. "
555,"I went to the supermarket just so I could talk to the cashier, you know, get back to human contact. But I got there, and it's those self-service checkouts. "
556,I haven't said that to anyone before. I felt like it was just me. 
557,MAN: It's not just you.
558,
559,[Road - Three Years Earlier]
560,
561,(Yasmin is sitting by the side of the road when the police car draws up and the policewoman gets out.) 
562,ANITA: Hitchhiking? 
563,YASMIN: No. 
564,ANITA: Just taking in the view? 
565,"YASMIN: Not breaking the law, am I? "
566,ANITA: No. Where are you off to? 
567,YASMIN: Away. 
568,ANITA: It's good there. 
569,YASMIN: Leave me alone. 
570,ANITA: Can't do that. 
571,YASMIN: Why not? 
572,ANITA: People are worried about you. 
573,"YASMIN: No, they're not. "
574,ANITA: Your sister is. That's why she called us. She's worried you've left and are going to do something stupid. I've heard things are tough. 
575,Getting bullied at school? Grades have gone a bit wonky? Parents don't get what's up? You must be feeling pretty trapped and alone. 
576,YASMIN: I'm feeling way more than that. 
577,ANITA: That's better than the other way. 
578,YASMIN: What? 
579,"ANITA: Well, feeling things isn't wrong.  "
580,YASMIN: I don't want your speech. 
581,"ANITA: I know. The terrible thing about being older is you have all this experience, and nobody ever wants to hear it. "
582,"Cos I know that there's so much ahead of you. What if this moment, where you want to run away from everyone, including yourself, is just that. A moment. "
583,What if we find a way to get you through it and out the other side? I've been where you are. Moments change. Help's out there. As much or as little as you need. 
584,YASMIN: I'm not listening to you. 
585,"ANITA: Would hard cash make a difference? I'll make you a deal. Look me up in three years. If I'm wrong, I'll give you 50 quid. "
586,"I mean, I'd say more, but the pay's rubbish. "
587,"YASMIN: Get another job, then. "
588,"ANITA: Can't. Love it too much. But if I'm right, you owe me 50p. Come on, those are good odds."

595,ANITA: Yasmin Khan. I flippin' do remember you. 
596,YASMIN: I've got something for you. 
597,(Holds out a 50p piece.)

600,[Tardis]
601,
602,"GRAHAM: The thing is, Doc, I worry about getting sick again. You know, about the... about the cancer coming back. And I didn't know who to say it to, "
603,"so I thought I'd say it to you. You know, seeing as you're a doctor. You know, cos once... once you have it, it's with you the whole time. "
604,"Not quite a shadow, but... Hey, don't get me wrong. I mean, my check-ups, they're all fine, but it... it made me think, you know and, er, I thought I should talk about it, "
605,"cos those nightmares, I mean... Well, they made me realise that the fear is... is... is still there, you know. "
606,(Long pause.) 
607,"DOCTOR: I should say a reassuring thing now, shouldn't I? "
608,"GRAHAM: Yeah, probably. "
609,"DOCTOR: I'm still quite socially awkward, so I'm just going to subtly walk towards the console and look at something. And then, in a minute, "
610,I'll think of something that I should've said... that might've been helpful. 
611,"GRAhAM: Ha! Okay. Well, I'm glad we had this chat, eh? "
612,DOCTOR: Yeah. 
613,GRAHAM: Yeah. 
614,"RYAN: How long is this going to last, Yaz? Hanging out with the Doctor. "
615,YASMIN: I don't know. 
616,"RYAN: Is this our lives? Going from one place to the next, ignoring home? We're getting older, but without them. Missing out bits of their lives.  "
617,"YASMIN: When we're done, The Doctor can drop you off at whatever point you want, though. "
618,"RYAN: Yeah, but we'll have changed. They wouldn't have. It's like we're living at different rates. "
619,YASMIN: The Doctor said we wouldn't come back the same. 
620,DOCTOR: I was thinking Frankenstein.  
621,RYAN: What? 
622,DOCTOR: Did I interrupt? Am I interrupting? 
623,RYAN: No. 
624,DOCTOR: Cool. You might need a change of clothes. 
625,YASMIN: On we go.
