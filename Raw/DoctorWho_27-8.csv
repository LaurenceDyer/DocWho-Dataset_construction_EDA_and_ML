22,(A photograph of a laughing man with thinning
23,hair.) 
24,ROSE : Peter Alan Tyler my dad. The most wonderful man in the
25,world. Born 15th September 1954. 
26,"JACKIE: Come here, Rose. Come here "
27,(Jackie has got a photograph album open. Little Rose joins her on the
28,bed.) 
29,JACKIE: Who's that? It's your daddy. You weren't old enough to remember
30,"when he died. 1987, 7th of November. Do you remember what I told you?"
31,The day that Stuart Hoskins and Sarah Clarke got married. He was always
32,"having adventures. Oh, he would have loved to have seen you now."
33,
34,[Tardis]
35,
36,ROSE: That's what Mum always says. So I was
37,"thinking, could we, could we go and see my dad when he was still alive?"
38,
39,"DOCTOR: Where's this come from, all of a sudden? "
40,"ROSE: All right then, if we can't, if it goes against the laws of times"
41,"or something, then never mind, just leave it. "
42,"DOCTOR: No, I can do anything. I'm just more worried about you. "
43,ROSE: I want to see him. 
44,DOCTOR: Your wish is my command. But be careful what you wish for. 
45,[Register office]
46,
47,(The Doctor and Rose attend her parent's wedding.) 
48,"REGISTRAR: I, Peter Alan Tyler, take you, Jacqueline Angela Suzette"
49,Prentice 
50,"PETE: I, Peter Alan Tyler, take you, Jacqueline Suzanne Suzette Anita "
51,"JACKIE: Oh, just carry on. It's good enough for Lady Di. "
52,ROSE: I thought he'd be taller. 
53,"REGISTRAR: To be my lawful wedded wife, to love and behold till death"
54,us do part. 
55,JACKIE : He died so close to home.
56,
57,[Memory - Jackie's bedroom]
58,
59,JACKIE: I wasn't there. Nobody was. It was a hit
60,and run driver. Never found out who. He was dead when the ambulance got
61,there. I only wish there'd been someone there for him. 
62,"ROSE : I want to be that someone, so he doesn't die alone."
63,
64,[Tardis]
65,
66,DOCTOR: November the 7th? 
67,ROSE: 1987. 
68,(The time rotor starts up.)
69,
70,[Waterley Street]
71,
72,(The Tardis has parked herself between a telephone
73,"junction box and a road sign, by park railings. Never Can Say Goodbye"
74,is playing somewhere.) 
75,ROSE: It's so weird. The day my father died. I thought it'd be all sort
76,of grim and stormy. It's just an ordinary day. 
77,DOCTOR: The past is another country. 1987's just the Isle of Wight. Are
78,you sure about this? 
79,ROSE: Yeah. 
80,[Jordan Road]
81,
82,ROSE: This is it. Jordan Road. He was late. He'd
83,"been to get a wedding present, a vase. Mum always said, that stupid"
84,vase. 
85,(A green van comes around the corner. D602 PKW) 
86,ROSE: He got out of his car. 
87,(It pulls into the kerb.) 
88,ROSE: And crossed the road. 
89,"ROSE: Oh, God. This is it. "
90,"(As Pete gets out of the van, the Doctor takes Rose's hand. A beige car"
91,comes round the corner - NEH 793W - and straight into Pete. The driver
92,"shields his face with his arm and keeps going, leaving Pete and the"
93,broken vase in the middle of the road. Pete tries to move.) 
94,"DOCTOR: Go to him, quick. "
95,"(But she can't. Later, round the corner, as sirens approach.) "
96,"ROSE: It's too late now. By the time the ambulance got there, he was"
97,dead. He can't die on his own. Can I try again? 
98,(The Doctor and Rose look round the corner to see themselves by the
99,kerbside.) 
100,"DOCTOR: Right, that's the first you and me. It's a very bad idea, two"
101,sets of us being here at the same time. Just be careful they don't see
102,"us. Wait till she runs off and he follows, then go to your dad. "
103,(Pete parks at the kerb.) 
104,"ROSE 1: Oh, God. This is it. "
105,ROSE: I can't do this. 
106,"DOCTOR: You don't have to do anything you don't want to, but this is"
107,the last time we can be here. 
108,(Rose runs forward as Pete is getting out of the van.) 
109,DOCTOR: Rose! No! 
110,(Rose dashes past her earlier self and pushes her father out of the
111,"path of the beige car. The vase rolls away, unbroken. The earlier"
112,Doctor and Rose vanish.) 
113,ROSE: I did it. I saved your life. 
114,"PETE: Blimey, did you see the speed of it? Did you get his number? "
115,"ROSE: I really did it. Oh, my God, look at you. You're alive! That car"
116,was going to
117,kill you. 
118,"PETE: Give me some credit, I did see it coming. I wasn't going to walk"
119,"under it, was I. "
120,ROSE: I'm Rose. 
121,PETE: That's a coincidence. That's my daughter's name. 
122,ROSE: That's a great name. Good choice. Well done. 
123,"PETE: Right, I'd better shift. I've got a wedding to go to. "
124,ROSE: Is that Sarah Clarke's wedding? 
125,"PETE: Yeah, are you going? "
126,ROSE: Yeah. 
127,PETE: You and your boyfriend need a lift? 
128,(Something with blood red eyesight flies over South London.)
129,
130,[The Tyler's flat]
131,
132,"PETE: Right, there we go. Sorry about the mess. If"
133,"you want a cup of tea, the kitchens just down there, milk's in the"
134,"fridge. Well, it would be, wouldn't it. Where else would you put the"
135,"milk? Mind you, there's always the window sill outside. I always"
136,"thought if someone invented a window sill with special compartments,"
137,"you know, one for milk, one for yogurt, make a lot of money out of"
138,"that. Sell it to students and things. I should write that down. Anyway,"
139,"never mind that, excuse me for a minute. Got to go and change. "
140,(Pete goes to the bedroom.) 
141,ROSE: All the stuff mum kept. His stuff. She kept it all packed away in
142,boxes in the cupboard. She used to show me when she'd had a bit to
143,"drink. Here it is, on display. Where it should be. Third prize at the"
144,"bowling. First two got to go to Didcot. Health drinks. Tonics, mum used"
145,to call them. He made his money selling this Vitex stuff. He had all
146,sorts of jobs. He was so clever. Solar power. Mum said he was
147,"going to do this. Now he can. Okay, look I'll tell him you're not my"
148,boyfriend. 
149,"DOCTOR: When we met, I said travel with me in space. You said no. Then"
150,I said time machine. 
151,"ROSE: It wasn't some big plan. I just saw it happening and I thought, I"
152,can stop it. 
153,DOCTOR: I did it again. I picked another stupid ape. I should've known.
154,It's not about showing you the universe. It never is. It's about the
155,universe doing something for you. 
156,"ROSE: So it's okay when you go to other times, and you save people's"
157,"lives, but not when it's me saving my dad. "
158,"DOCTOR: I know what I'm doing, you don't. Two sets of us being there"
159,made that a vulnerable point. 
160,ROSE: But he's alive! 
161,DOCTOR: My entire planet died. My whole family. Do you think it never
162,occurred to me to go back and save them? 
163,ROSE: But it's not like I've changed history. Not much. I mean he's
164,never going to
165,be a world leader. He's not going to start World War Three or anything.
166,
167,"DOCTOR: Rose, there's a man alive in the world who wasn't alive before."
168,An ordinary man. That's the most important thing in creation. The whole
169,world's different because he's alive. 
170,"ROSE: What, would you rather him dead? "
171,DOCTOR: I'm not saying that. 
172,"ROSE: No, I get it! For once, you're not the most important man in my"
173,life. 
174,"DOCTOR: Let's see how you get on without me, then. Give me the key. The"
175,"Tardis key. If I'm so insignificant, give it me back. "
176,"ROSE: All right then, I will. "
177,(Rose hands over the key.) 
178,"DOCTOR: You've got what you wanted, so that's goodbye, then. "
179,ROSE: You don't scare me. I know how sad you are. You'll be back in a
180,"minute, or you'll hang around outside the Tardis waiting for me. And"
181,I'll make you wait a long time! 
182,(The Doctor leaves and Rose slams the door behind him. Pete puts his
183,head round the bedroom door.) 
184,PETE: Boyfriend trouble? 
185,"(The red-eyed thing flies over the area, then a man clipping a shrub"
186,"suddenly disappears with a brief scream, followed by a woman pegging"
187,"out the washing and a tramp drinking cider. Indoors, Rose is putting"
188,peanuts back into their bowl. Pete has changed into his wedding suit.) 
189,"PETE: Excuse me, do you mind? What're you tidying up for? "
190,ROSE: Sorry. Force of habit. 
191,"PETE: Listen, don't worry about him. Couples have rows all the time. "
192,ROSE: We're not a couple. Why does everyone think we're a couple? I
193,think he left me. 
194,"PETE: What, a pretty girl like you? If I was going out with you "
195,ROSE: Stop right there. 
196,PETE: I was just saying 
197,"ROSE: I know what you're saying, and we're not going there. At no point"
198,are we going anywhere near there. You aren't even aware that there
199,"exists. I don't even want to think about there, and believe me, neither"
200,"do you. There for you is like, like the Bermuda Triangle. "
201,"PETE: Blimey, you know how to flatter a bloke. "
202,"ROSE: Right, are we off? "
203,(Rose offers Pete her arm.) 
204,"PETE: So, that wouldn't be a mixed signal at all? "
205,ROSE: Absolutely not. 
206,PETE: I'll take you back to the loony bin where you belong. Except I'm
207,sure I've met you somewhere before. 
208,[St Pauls Church]
209,
210,(The nervous groom is waiting for the bride to turn
211,up. A few guests are scattered in the pews.) 
212,STUART: It's weird. 
213,DAD: What? 
214,"STUART: There's so many people missing. Uncle Steven, Auntie Lynn, all"
215,the Baxters. Where are they? You don't think something's gone wrong? 
216,DAD: Maybe it's a godsend. It gives you time to think. You don't have
217,"to go through with it, not these days. Live in sin for a bit. "
218,STUART: Dad 
219,"DAD: In ten years time, you'll turn round and say, if only I could turn"
220,the clock back. Is it me or did it just get cold? 
221,[Waterley Street]
222,
223,(The Doctor outside the Tardis when he looks up for
224,a moment. He unlocks the doors and opens them to reveal an empty police
225,telephone box. The Tardis interior is missing.) 
226,DOCTOR: Rose! 
227,[Pete's car]
228,
229,"PETE: I met this bloke at the horse's, and he's"
230,cutting me in on copyright. 
231,ROSE: But I thought you were a proper businessman and that. 
232,"PETE: I wish! Oh, I do a bit of this, a bit of that. I scrape by. "
233,"ROSE: Right. So I must've heard wrong. So, really you're a bit of a Del"
234,Boy? 
235,"PETE: Oh, shoot me down in flames. You're not related to my wife by any"
236,"chance, are you? "
237,"ROSE: Oh, my God. She's going to be at the wedding. "
238,"PETE: What, Jackie? Do you know her? "
239,ROSE: Sort of. 
240,"PETE: What's she told you about me, then? "
241,ROSE: She said she'd picked the most fantastic man in the world. 
242,"PETE: Must be a different Jackie, then. She'd never say that. "
243,"(The radio changes to 105.4FM, and rap music comes out. I am reliably"
244,informed
245,"that it is Don't Mug Yourself, by The Streets.) "
246,PETE: This stuff goes right over my head. 
247,ROSE: That's not out yet. 
248,PETE: It's a good job and all. 
249,ROSE; I'm just going to check my messages. 
250,"PETE: How do you mean, messages? Is that a phone? "
251,ROSE: Yeah. 
252,"BELL : Watson, come here. I need you. Watson, come here. I need"
253,"you. Watson, come here. I need you. "
254,(The car that should have killed Pete is behind them. Pete turns a
255,"corner, it drives straight on then vanishes.)"
256,
257,[Outside St Pauls Church]
258,
259,(Stuart's dad is using a proper mobile phone of the
260,time - the size of a brick. Guests are entering and the bridesmaids are
261,just arriving.) 
262,DAD: Half the guests haven't turned up. You're better off not being
263,"here, it's a disaster in the making. No, in this case, knocked her up"
264,is a phrase I'd use. 
265,"BELL : Watson, come here. I need you. "
266,DAD: Hello? Who is this? 
267,"BELL : Watson, come here. I ne "
268,(He tries redialing. Stuart comes out of the church.) 
269,"STUART: Dad, get inside. We can't see the bride before the wedding."
270,It's bad luck. 
271,"DAD: It was bad luck when you met her. I tell you, this day is cursed. "
272,(They go back inside. The bride arrives. Her dress is a mass of Lady Di
273,flounces.)
274,"BEV: Now, that's what I call a meringue. "
275,"SUZIE: Listen, Stuart's dad said and go round the block, cos there's"
276,people missing. 
277,"SARAH: How do you mean, missing? "
278,"BEV: There's no Dave, no Sunita, no Bea. "
279,SUZIE: There's no one from the Lamb and Flag. 
280,"SARAH: Oh, my train's detached again. I knew I should've used Velcro. "
281,"JACKIE: I'm here. Stop your bellyaching. Take Rose a sec, will you? "
282,(Jackie hands over a baby in a carry cot.) 
283,"BEV: Oh, ain't she pretty? "
284,"JACKIE: She's a little madam, that's what she is. Oh, I need more"
285,hands. Where's her useless article of a dad got to? 
286,(Pete drives round the corner.)
287,
288,[Pete's car]
289,
290,(The beige car suddenly appears and drives towards
291,them.) 
292,ROSE: Dad! 
293,"(Pete swerves into the kerb, missing a tree.) "
294,PETE: It's that car. Same one as before. 
295,[Outside St Pauls Church]
296,
297,PETE: It was right in front of us. Where's he gone?
298,You called me Dad. What'd you say that for? 
299,"JACKIE: Oh, wonderful. Here he is, the accident waiting to happen."
300,You'd be late for your own funeral and it nearly was! 
301,PETE: No damage done. 
302,JACKIE: And who's this? What're you looking at with your mouth open? 
303,ROSE: Your hair. 
304,JACKIE: What?! 
305,"ROSE: I've never seen it like. I mean, it's lovely. Your hair's lovely."
306,And that baby you're holding. That would be your baby. 
307,"JACKIE: Another one of yours, is she? "
308,PETE: She saved my life! 
309,"JACKIE: Oh, that's a new one. What was it last time? "
310,PETE: I didn't even know her. She was a cloakroom attendant. I was
311,helping her look for my ticket. There were three duffel coats all the
312,same. Somehow the rack collapsed. We were under all this stuff. 
313,ROSE: Were you playing around? 
314,JACKIE: What's it got to do with you what he gets up to? 
315,ROSE: What does he get up to? 
316,JACKIE: You'd know. 
317,"PETE: Oh, 'cos I'm that stupid. I play around and I bring her to meet"
318,the missus. You silly cow. 
319,JACKIE: But you are that stupid. 
320,PETE: Can we keep this stuff back home just for now? 
321,"JACKIE: What, with the rest of the rubbish? You bring home cut-price"
322,"detergents, tonic water, Betamax tapes and none of it works. I'm"
323,drowning in your rubbish. What did he tell you? Did he say he's this
324,"big businessman, 'cos he's not. He's a failure. Born failure, that one."
325,"Rose needs a proper father, not one who's flannelling about like some"
326,big kid. 
327,"PETE: Jackie, I'm making a living, it keeps us fed, don't it? "
328,ROSE: Stop it! 
329,ROSE: You're not like this. You love each other. 
330,"JACKIE: Oh, Pete. You never used to like them mental. Or I don't know,"
331,maybe you did. 
332,"PETE: Jackie, wait, just listen. "
333,"JACKIE: If you're not careful, there'll be a wedding and a divorce on"
334,the same day. 
335,PETE: Wait here. Give us a couple of minutes with the missus. Tell you
336,"what, straighten the car up. Stick it round the corner or something."
337,Don't cause anymore trouble. 
338,(Pete takes the vase and gives Rose his car keys.) 
339,[Playground]
340,
341, (The red-eyed monster hovers over a playground. A
342,woman is pushing her son on the swing. From the colour of his skin we
343,can guess who this should be.) 
344,"MICKEY: Hey, Jack. Jeff. "
345,(But the boy on the slide and the two on the see-saw have just
346,vanished. Then his mother isn't behind him any more either. Mickey
347,runs.) 
348,[Outside St Pauls Church]
349,
350,JACKIE: I'm not listening. It's just the duffel
351,coats all over again. 
352,"PETE: Jackie, sometimes a duffel coat is just a duffel coat. Things"
353,"will get better soon, I promise. "
354,JACKIE: I've had enough of all your daft schemes. I never know where
355,the next meal's coming from. 
356,"PETE: I'll get it right, love. One day soon, I promise you, I'll get it"
357,right. Come on. 
358,(The little boy runs round the corner from Waterley Street.) 
359,MICKEY: Monsters! Going to eat us! 
360,"SUZIE: What sort of monsters, sweetheart? Is it aliens? "
361,(Mickey runs straight into the church. The Doctor runs up behind Rose.)
362,
363,DOCTOR: Rose! Get in the church! 
364,(A large thing with bat-like wings appears in the sky. Very devilish.
365,It hisses and starts to swoop. Rose screams. The Doctor pushes her to
366,the pavement just in time to avoid its talons.) 
367,DOCTOR: Get in the church! 
368,(Two more appear.) 
369,"SUZIE: Oh, my God. What are they? What are they?"
370,DOCTOR: Inside! 
371,STUART: Sarah! 
372,DOCTOR: Stay in there! 
373,"(Stuart's dad tries to run away, but he gets pounced on. Another blocks"
374,"Sarah's path to the church, but when she screams it flies off and"
375,pounces on the vicar instead.) 
376,DOCTOR: In! 
377,[St Pauls Church]
378,
379,(The Doctor gets the bride's party inside and slams
380,the doors on the creatures. They can be seen flying around outside.) 
381,DOCTOR: They can't get in. Old windows and doors. Okay. The older
382,"something is, the stronger it is. What else? Go and check the other"
383,doors! Move! 
384,JACKIE: What's happening? What are they? What are they? 
385,DOCTOR: There's been an accident in time. A wound in time. They're like
386,"bacteria, taking advantage. "
387,"JACKIE: What do you mean, time? What're you jabbering on about, time? "
388,"DOCTOR: Oh, I might've known you'd argue. Jackie, I'm sick of you"
389,complaining. 
390,JACKIE: How do you know my name? 
391,DOCTOR: I haven't got time for this. 
392,JACKIE: I've never met you in my life! 
393,"DOCTOR: No, and you never will unless I sort this out. Now, if you"
394,"don't mind, I've waited a long time to say this. Jackie Tyler, do as I"
395,say. Go and check the doors. 
396,"JACKIE: Yes, sir. "
397,DOCTOR: I should have done that ages ago. 
398,STUART: My dad was out there. 
399,DOCTOR: You can mourn him later. Right now we've got to concentrate on
400,keeping ourselves alive. 
401,STUART: My dad had 
402,DOCTOR: There's nothing I can do for him. 
403,"STUART: No, but he had this phone thing. I can't get it to work. I keep"
404,getting this voice. 
405,"BELL : Watson, come here. I need you. Watson, come here. I need"
406,you. 
407,DOCTOR: That's the very first phone call. Alexander Graham Bell. I
408,don't think the telephone's
409,going to be much use. 
410,STUART: But someone must have called the police. 
411,DOCTOR: Police can't help you now. No one can. Nothing in this universe
412,can harm those things. Time's been damaged and they've come to
413,sterilise the wound.
414,By consuming everything inside. 
415,ROSE: Is this because? Is this my fault?

425,[Vestry]
426,
427,(All laid out for the signing of the register.) 
428,PETE: There's smoke coming up from the city but no sirens. I don't
429,think it's just us. I think these things are all over the place. Maybe
430,the whole world. 
431,"(The beige car appears at the corner, turns, the driver covers his face"
432,and it disappears again.) 
433,PETE: Was that a car? 
434,DOCTOR: It's not important. Don't worry about it. 
435,[St Pauls Church]
436,
437,(Rose is standing by the altar when Pete comes out
438,of the vestry.) 
439,"PETE: This mate of yours. What did he mean, this is your fault? "
440,ROSE: Don't know. Just everything. 
441,PETE: I gave you my car keys. You don't give your keys to a complete
442,"stranger. It's, it's like I trusted you. Moment I met you, I just did."
443,"wound in time. You called me Dad. I can see it. My eyes, Jackie's"

447,ROSE: Dad. My Dad. My Daddy. 
448,"(Meanwhile, a creature is head-butting a side door. The Doctor pulls"
449,the curtain aside and gets out his sonic screwdriver.) 
450,"STUART: Excuse me, Mister "
451,DOCTOR: Doctor. 
452,STUART: You seem to know what's going on. 
453,"DOCTOR: I give that impression, yeah. "
454,STUART: I just wanted to ask 
455,SARAH: Can you save us? 
456,"DOCTOR: Who are you two, then? "
457,STUART: Stuart Hoskins. 
458,SARAH: Sarah Clark. 
459,DOCTOR: And one extra. Boy or girl? 
460,"SARAH: I don't know. I don't want to know, really. "
461,DOCTOR: How did all this get started? 
462,"STUART: Outside the Beatbox Club, two in the morning. "
463,"SARAH: Street corner. I'd lost my purse, didn't have money for a taxi. "
464,STUART: I took her home. 
465,DOCTOR: Then what? Asked her for a date? 
466,SARAH: Wrote his number on the back of my hand. 
467,STUART: Never got rid of her since. My dad said. 
468,"SARAH: I don't know what this is all about, and I know we're not"
469,important. 
470,DOCTOR: Who said you're not important? I've travelled to all sorts of
471,"places, done things you couldn't even imagine, but you two. Street"
472,"corner, two in the morning, getting a taxi home. I've never had a life"
473,like that. Yes. I'll try and save you. 
474,[Vestry]
475,
476,"PETE: I'm a dad. I mean, I'm already a dad, but"
477,"Rose grows up and she's you. That's wonderful. I mean,"
478,"I suppose I thought that you'd be a bit useless, what with my useless"
479,"genes and all, but. Well, I mean, how did you get here? "
480,ROSE: Do you really want to know? 
481,PETE: Yeah. 
482,ROSE: A time machine. 
483,PETE: Time machine. 
484,ROSE: Cross my heart. 
485,"PETE: What, do you all have time machines where you come from? "
486,"ROSE: No, just the Doctor. "
487,PETE: Did you know these things were coming? 
488,ROSE: No. 
489,"PETE: God, I don't know, my head's spinning. What's the future like? "
490,ROSE: It's not so different. 
491,PETE: What am I like? Have I gone grey? Have I gone bald? Don't tell me
492,"I've gone bald. So, if this mate of yours isn't your boyfriend and I"
493,"have to say, I'm glad, because being your dad and all, I think he's a"
494,bit old for you. Have you got a bloke? 
495,"ROSE: No, I did have. "
496,JACKIE : Mickey! 
497,(Little Mickey runs up to Rose and hugs her.) 
498,PETE: Do you know him? 
499,"ROSE: I just didn't recognise him in a suit. You have to let go of me,"
500,sweetheart. I'm always saying that. 
501,JACKIE: He just grabs hold of what's passing and holds on for dear
502,life. God help his poor girlfriend if he ever gets one. 
503,PETE: Me and Rose were just talking. 
504,"JACKIE: Oh, yeah? Talking? While the world comes to an end, what do you"
505,"do? Cling to the youngest blonde. Come on, Mick. "
506,(Jackie and Mickey leave.) 
507,ROSE: You can't tell her. 
508,PETE: Why? 
509,"ROSE: I mean, I really don't want you to tell her. "
510,"PETE: What, do you don't want people to know? "
511,"ROSE: Where I come from, Jackie doesn't know how to work the timer on"
512,the video recorder. 
513,PETE: I showed her that last week. Point taken. 
514,[St Pauls Church]
515,
516,(The Doctor is talking to baby Rose in her carrycot
517,by the choir stalls.) 
518,"DOCTOR: Now, Rose you're not going to bring about the end of the world,"
519,are you? Are you? 
520,(Rose walks up.) 
521,DOCTOR: Jackie gave her to me to look after. How times change. 
522,ROSE: I'd better be careful. I think I just imprinted myself on Mickey
523,like a mother chicken. 
524,DOCTOR: No. Don't touch the baby. You're both the same person. That's a
525,"paradox, and we don't want a paradox happening, not with these things"
526,"outside. Anything new, any disturbance in time makes them stronger. The"
527,paradox might let them in. 
528,"ROSE: Can't do anything right, can I? "
529,"DOCTOR: Since you ask, no. So, don't touch the baby. "
530,ROSE: I'm not stupid. 
531,"DOCTOR: You could have fooled me. All right, I'm sorry. I wasn't really"
532,going to
533,leave you on your own. 
534,ROSE: I know. 
535,"DOCTOR: But between you and me, I haven't got a plan. No idea. No way"
536,out. 
537,ROSE: You'll think of something. 
538,"DOCTOR: The entire Earth's been sterilised. This, and other place like"
539,"it, are all that's left of the human race. We might hold out for a"
540,"while, but nothing can stop those creatures. They'll get through in the"
541,end. The walls aren't that old. And there's nothing I can do to stop
542,them. There used to be laws stopping this kind of thing from happening.
543,My people would have stopped this. But they're all gone. And now I'm
544,going the same way. 
545,ROSE: If I'd realised. 
546,DOCTOR: Just tell me you're sorry. 
547,ROSE: I am. I'm sorry. 
548,(They hug.) 
549,ROSE: Have you got something hot? 
550,"(She reaches into his inside pocket, takes out a key and drops it"
551,because it is glowing hot.) 
552,DOCTOR: It's the Tardis key! 
553,(He takes off his jacket to pick it up safely.) 
554,DOCTOR: It's telling me it's still connected to the Tardis. 
555,(He makes an announcement from the pulpit.) 
556,DOCTOR: The inside of my ship was thrown out of the wound but we can
557,"use this to bring it back. And once I've got my ship back, then I can"
558,"mend everything. Now, I just need a bit of power. Has anybody got a"
559,battery? 
560,(Stuart picks up the mobile phone.) 
561,STUART: This one big enough? 
562,DOCTOR: Fantastic. 
563,STUART: Good old dad. There you go. 
564,DOCTOR: Just need to do a bit of charging up and then we can bring
565,everyone back. 
566,(He uses the ever-versatile sonic screwdriver while the creatures
567,batter at the doors. Pete and Rose have a quiet chat.) 
568,"PETE: You, er, you never said why you came here in the first place. If"
569,"I had a time machine, I wouldn't have thought 1987 was anything"
570,"special. Not round here, anyway. "
571,ROSE: We just ended up here. 
572,"PETE: Lucky for me, eh? If you hadn't been there to save me. "
573,ROSE: That was just a coincidence. That was just really good luck. It's
574,amazing. 
575,"PETE: So, in the future, are me and her indoors still together? "
576,ROSE: Yeah. 
577,PETE: Are you still living with us? 
578,ROSE: Yep. 
579,PETE: Am I a good dad? 
580,"ROSE: You, you told me a bedtime story every night when I was small."
581,"You were always there. You never missed one. And er, you took us for"
582,picnics in the country every Saturday. You never let us down. You were
583,there for us all the time. Someone I could really rely on. 
584,PETE: That's not me. 
585,(The Tardis slowly materialises around her key.) 
586,"DOCTOR: Right, no one touches that key. Have you got that? Don't touch"
587,"it. Anyone touches that key, it'll be, well, zap. Just leave it be and"
588,"everything will be fine. We'll get out of here. All of us. Stuart,"
589,Sarah you're
590,"going to get married, just like I said. "
591,"(Outside, the car repeats its brief drive around the corner. Inside,"
592,the Tardis is fading in and out.) 
593,ROSE: When time gets sorted out 
594,"DOCTOR: Everybody here forgets what happened. And don't worry, the"
595,thing that you changed will stay changed. 
596,"PETE: You mean I'll still be alive, though I'm meant to be dead. That's"
597,"why I haven't done anything with my life, why I didn't mean anything. "
598,DOCTOR: It doesn't work like that. 
599,PETE: Rubbish. I'm so useless I couldn't even die properly. Now it's my
600,fault all of this has happened. 
601,ROSE: This is my fault. 
602,"PETE: No, love. I'm your dad. It's my job for it to be my fault. "
603,"JACKIE: Her dad? How are you her dad? How old were you, twelve? Oh,"
604,that's disgusting. 
605,"PETE: Jacks, listen. This is Rose. "
606,JACKIE: Rose? How sick is that? You give my daughter a second hand
607,name? How many are there? Do you call them all Rose? 
608,"PETE: Oh, for God's sake, look. It's the same Rose! "
609,(Pete takes baby Rose from Jackie and hands her to Rose.) 
610,DOCTOR: Rose! No! 
611,(The Doctor snatches her away too late and gives her back to Jackie. A
612,creature appears inside the Church.) 
613,"DOCTOR: Everyone, behind me! I'm the oldest thing in here. "
614,ROSE: Doctor! 
615,"(The creature pounces on the Doctor, then flies over to the Tardis."
616,"They touch, the Tardis and the creature vanish, and the key falls to"
617,the floor. Rose runs to pick it up.) 
618,"ROSE: It's cold. The key's cold. Oh, my God, he's dead. This is all my"
619,fault. Both of you. All of you. The whole world. 
620,BEV: This is it. There's nothing we can do. It's the end. 
621,"(As the creatures start scraping at the stonework outside, Pete watches"
622,the car drive around the corner again and again from the vestry window.
623,"He goes back into the church and over to Rose, who is sitting on her"
624,own.) 
625,PETE: The Doctor really cared about you. He didn't want you to go
626,"through it again, not if there was another way. Now there isn't. "
627,ROSE: What are you talking about? 
628,"PETE: The car that should have killed me, love. It's here. The Doctor"
629,"worked it out way back, but he, er, he tried to protect me. Still, he's"
630,not in charge anymore. I am. 
631,ROSE: But you can't. 
632,"PETE: Who am I, love? "
633,ROSE: My daddy. 
634,"PETE: Jackie, look at her. She's ours. "
635,"JACKIE: Oh, of course. "
636,(Jackie hugs the weeping Rose.) 
637,"PETE: I'm meant to be dead, Jackie. You're going to get rid of me at"
638,last. 
639,JACKIE: Don't say that. 
640,"PETE: For once in your life, trust me. It's got be done. You've got to"
641,"survive, because you've got to bring up our daughter. I never read you"
642,those bedtime stories. I never took you on those picnics. I was never
643,there for you. 
644,ROSE: You would have been. 
645,PETE: But I can do this for you. I can be a proper dad to you now. 
646,ROSE: But it's not fair. 
647,PETE: I've had all these extra hours. No one else in the world has ever
648,"had that. And on top of that, I got to see you. And you're beautiful."
649,"How lucky am I, eh? So, come on, do as your dad says. You going to be"
650,"there for me, love? Thanks for saving me. "
651,[Outside St Pauls Church]
652,
653,"(Pete runs out of the church, clutching the vase. A"
654,"creature spots him. He runs to the corner, where the car appears. The"
655,driver flings his arm across his face.) 
656,"PETE: Goodbye, love. "
657,(Thump! The vase drops and breaks. The creatures vanish.) 
658,[St Pauls Church]
659,
660,DOCTOR: Go to him. Quick. 
661,[Outside St Pauls Church]
662,
663,"(Rose runs to her dying father. This time, the"
664,driver has stopped at the scene. Pete dies gazing into Rose's eyes.) 
665,SARAH: What's that? 
666,(Stuart's dad comes out of the church.) 
667,JACKIE : The driver was just a kid. 
668,[Memory - Jackie's bedroom]
669,
670,"JACKIE: He stopped, he waited for the police. It"
671,"wasn't his fault. For some reason, Pete just ran out. People say there"
672,"was this girl, and she sat with Pete while he was dying. She held his"
673,hand. Then she was gone. Never found out who she was.
674,
675,[Jordan Road]
676,
677,(Rose kisses Pete farewell then stands up and looks
678,at the Doctor.) 
679,"ROSE : Peter Alan Tyler, my dad. The most wonderful man in the"
680,"world. Died the 7th of November, 1987. "
681,(The Tardis has relocated to outside the Tandoori across the road. The
682,Doctor and Rose walk away.)
