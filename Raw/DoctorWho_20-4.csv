20, [Tardis corridor] 
21, TURLOUGH: I'm scared. This place is like a maze.
22,Where am I supposed to be going? 
23,"GUARDIAN : Your function is to obey, not question. "
24,"TURLOUGH: I may not have must time. I don't think they trust me,"
25,especially Tegan. 
26,GUARDIAN : The roundel behind you. 
27,"(Turlough touches one at head height, then the one beneath it.) "
28,GUARDIAN : That one. Open it. 
29,(The roundel hinges down to reveal circuitry in the wall.) 
30,GUARDIAN : Operate the blue switches. Now you'll be able to remove
31,the space-time element from beneath the console. 
32,TURLOUGH: Which switches will release the Tardis to my control? 
33,GUARDIAN : Do only as I say. 
34,TEGAN : Turlough! 
35,"GUARDIAN : Quickly, close the roundel. "
36,TURLOUGH: Now what do I do? 
37,GUARDIAN : Go to the console room. 
38,TURLOUGH: And? Where have you gone? 
39,TEGAN: Who were you talking to? 
40,"TURLOUGH: Oh, no one. I was singing. Not very well, I'm afraid. "
41,TEGAN: Why didn't you answer when I called? 
42,"TURLOUGH: I'm very sorry, I didn't hear you. "
43,"TEGAN: You're up to something, I can feel it. "
44,TURLOUGH: I'm simply looking around. The Tardis is so very large. 
45,(The roundel drops open again.) 
46,TEGAN: What have you been doing? Have you touched anything? 
47,TURLOUGH: You look so sweet when you get angry. 
48,TEGAN: I'm being serious. What have you been doing? 
49,TURLOUGH: Nothing. You're being foolishly and unjustifiably suspicious.
50,"Tegan, why do you dislike me so much? "
51,TEGAN: You're unreliable. 
52,TURLOUGH: You hardly know me. 
53,TEGAN: I heard the way you were talking to the Doctor. 
54,TURLOUGH: Being friendly hardly makes me unreliable. 
55,TEGAN: It's the way you were doing it. 
56,"TURLOUGH: Oh, you would prefer I used your sledgehammer tactics? "
57,TEGAN: At least I'm honest. 
58,TURLOUGH: Being rude isn't honest. Neither is overreacting. If I choose
59,"to smooth the way with a smile and a soft phrase, that doesn't make me"
60,"unreliable. Charm, the way I use it, is to disagree agreeably. "
61,TEGAN: You were using it to deceive. 
62,"TURLOUGH: Oh, you're so typical of your planet, reduced to shouting if"
63,you can't have your own way. 
64,TEGAN: I am not! 
65,TURLOUGH: No? You seem unable to grasp that there are other approaches.
66,To smile before asking. 
67,"TEGAN: Don't patronise me, Turlough. "
68,TURLOUGH: I'm simply relating what I think. 
69,TEGAN: Turning an argument around is something you're very good at. 
70,TURLOUGH: Listen to yourself. You're so concrete in the way you think.
71,Why can't you just agree to differ? 
72,TEGAN: I think you're dangerous. 
73,TURLOUGH: I think we should try and be friends. 
74,TEGAN: I'm going to tell the Doctor about the roundel. 
75,"TURLOUGH: Do so, but you'd only make a fool of yourself. I travel in"
76,"the Tardis too, now. I have no desire to kill myself. I had no reason"
77,to open that roundel. Where are you going? 
78,TEGAN: To show you to your room. 
79,TURLOUGH: We're friends? 
80,TEGAN: Not yet. 
81, [Turlough's room] 
82, (While Nyssa is doing some experiment in the
83,"girl's room, Tegan shows Turlough to Adric's old quarters.) "
84,TURLOUGH: Looks like a kid's room. 
85,TEGAN: It was Adric's. 
86,TURLOUGH: Who? 
87,TEGAN: Doesn't matter. 
88,"TURLOUGH: I've had enough of children, what with that awful school on"
89,Earth. 
90,TEGAN: You can change things if you want. 
91,"TURLOUGH: Right, all this can go for a start. "
92,TEGAN: It's your room. Do what you like. 
93,"(Tegan leaves with the Kinda necklace. Turlough comes out, rolling up"
94,his sleeves.) 
95, [Nyssa and Tegan's room] 
96, TEGAN: He's got the manners of a pig. 
97,NYSSA: The Doctor? 
98,"TEGAN: The brat, Turlough. "
99,NYSSA: He'll settle down. 
100, [Tardis] 
101, (The console room is deserted when Turlough sneaks
102,in and takes the Guardian's crystal from his pocket. It glows.) 
103,TURLOUGH: It's repaired itself. 
104,GUARDIAN [on scanner]: Concentrate. You have work to do. 
105, [Nyssa and Tegan's room] 
106, TEGAN: What are you doing? 
107,NYSSA: Synthesising an enzyme. I seem to need the practice. 
108,TEGAN: You've done it before. 
109,"NYSSA: Adric did the calculation for me. My own figures aren't as good,"
110,as you can see. 
111,"TEGAN: I'll see if I can find his notes, before Turlough destroys them."
112,
113, [Tardis] 
114, (Turlough is trying to pull a component out of the
115,console base.) 
116,TURLOUGH: What will this do? 
117,GUARDIAN [on scanner]: You are touching the heart of the Tardis. Rip it
118,free! 
119,TURLOUGH: What happens to me? 
120,GUARDIAN [on scanner]: You will be safe. I am ready to lift you away. 
121,"(The console starts beeping and flashing, and the time rotor stops"
122,moving.) 
123, [Turlough's room] 
124, (Tegan knocks on the door then enters.) 
125,TEGAN: Turlough? 
126, [Outside Turlough's room] 
127, TEGAN: Turlough? 
128, [Tardis] 
129, TURLOUGH: It's stuck. 
130,GUARDIAN [on scanner]: Continue. 
131,TURLOUGH: I'm trying. It won't move. 
132,GUARDIAN [on scanner]: The break-up is beginning. I can sense it.
133,Remove the space-time element! 
134,TEGAN : Turlough? 
135, [Tardis corridor] 
136, (There is a hazy mist in front of Tegan.) 
137,"TEGAN: Turlough? Oh, no. Doctor! "
138,(The mist effect is entering the girl's room through the wall. Nyssa
139,turns to stare at it.) 
140,DOCTOR: What is it? 
141,TEGAN: Quickly! 
142,(The Doctor runs up to the mist.) 
143,TEGAN: What is it? 
144,DOCTOR: We're in trouble. I'll explain later. 
145, [Tardis] 
146, (Turlough gets out from under the console and
147,grabs the crystal just before the Doctor and Tegan run in.) 
148,DOCTOR: What was Nyssa working on? 
149,TEGAN: Nothing that could have caused this. 
150,"DOCTOR: The rotor's jamming. Well, there's a safety cut out. "
151,(The Doctor pulls it out.) 
152,TURLOUGH: Is Nyssa safe? 
153,"DOCTOR: Well, we'll see. I'm trying to refocus the exterior viewer on"
154,the interior of the Tardis. 
155,TEGAN: It's just a mess. 
156,"DOCTOR: Dimensional instability, that's the danger. Nyssa! "
157, [Nyssa and Tegan's room] 
158," DOCTOR : Nyssa, can you hear me? "
159,NYSSA: Yes! 
160,DOCTOR : Stay well back. There's nothing you can do. Nyssa? 
161, [Tardis] 
162, (The scanner view is looking over Nyssa's shoulder
163,into the swirly effect.) 
164,TEGAN: What's that? I saw something just for a moment. 
165,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. The outside universe is breaking through. "
166,TEGAN: Look! 
167,(The image of a skull is visible.) 
168, [Nyssa and Tegan's room] 
169," (As Nyssa hugs her notebook, her apparatus starts"
170,to explode. She squeals and turns away.) 
171,"DOCTOR : Look behind you, Nyssa. "
172,(The image of a skull is on a solid door which is opening.) 
173, [Tardis] 
174," DOCTOR: Go through, Nyssa. It's your only chance. "
175,TEGAN: Where are you sending her? 
176,"DOCTOR: I don't know, but if she stays in the room, she'll die. "
177,"(Nyssa takes a final look over her shoulder, then the screen goes"
178,white.) 
179,"DOCTOR: Nyssa, if you can hear me, "
180, [Space liner]
181,
182, (Nyssa walks through into a corridor.) 
183,"DOCTOR : Keep moving. Keep moving, Nyssa. Stay ahead of it. If you"
184,"don't, it will kill you. "
185,(Nyssa drops her notebook and runs.) 
186, [Tardis] 
187, (The image on the scanner clears to show the
188,girl's room. There is a background thrumming sound.) 
189,TEGAN: What's that? 
190,DOCTOR: I don't know. 
191,TURLOUGH: Where does that door lead to? 
192,DOCTOR: Another spacecraft. 
193,TEGAN: Look! 
194,(The door is beginning to close.) 
195,(The Doctor pushes past Tegan and they all run out.) 
196, [Nyssa and Tegan's room] 
197, (The Doctor throws a metal chair into the
198,remaining gap to keep the door open.) 
199,TEGAN: Where did the other spacecraft come from? 
200,DOCTOR: The Tardis found it. There's a fail-safe. On impending
201,"break-up, it seeks out and locks onto the nearest spacecraft. "
202,TEGAN: You never mentioned it before. 
203,"DOCTOR: Well, it never worked before. "
204, [Space liner]
205,
206, (The Doctor crawls under the chair into the
207,corridor. Tegan starts to follow.) 
208,TEGAN: Well? 
209,DOCTOR: She's gone. Stay there. 
210, [Nyssa and Tegan's room] 
211, TEGAN: Nyssa's gone. 
212,(There is a distant whirring sound.) 
213,TURLOUGH: What was that? 
214,TEGAN: The Doctor! 
215, [Space liner]
216,
217, TEGAN: Doctor? Doctor? 
218, [Nyssa and Tegan's room] 
219, (Turlough takes out the crystal.) 
220,GUARDIAN: Follow them. 
221,TURLOUGH: I can't. 
222,"GUARDIAN: Follow, and kill him! "
223, [Space liner]
224,
225, TURLOUGH : Tegan? 
226,(Turlough crawls into the corridor. Suddenly the chair is pulled from
227,the gap and the door slams shut.) 
228,TURLOUGH: I wonder how that happened. 
229,(The skull motif disappears and it becomes part of the corridor wall.) 
230,TEGAN: It seems we have no choice. We go on. 
231,"(Further on, the Doctor finds handprints on the wall.) "
232,"DOCTOR: What have I sent you into, Nyssa? "
233,(A spaceship docks. There is that whirring sound again.) 
234,"TEGAN: Come on, we can catch up with the Doctor. Come on! "
235,(Nyssa hides below a staircase as she hears someone coming. It's the
236,Doctor. He sees her curled up into a little ball.) 
237,DOCTOR: Nyssa. 
238,NYSSA: Doctor! 
239,(She runs into his arms.) 
240,NYSSA: Where are we? 
241,DOCTOR: I think it's some sort of old passenger liner. 
242,NYSSA: And those things? 
243,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, some people have the strangest ideas about decor."
244,"Come on, let's get back to the Tardis. "
245,"(Elsewhere, there is an explosion as someone blows a hole in a"
246,"bulkhead, then comes through wearing an enormous clear space helmet."
247,She speaks to the man following her.) 
248,KARI: Check the air seal. 
249,(The hole has filled up with foam.) 
250,OLVIR: Secure. 
251,(In yet another corridor -) 
252,TEGAN: I'm positive that was Nyssa calling. 
253,TURLOUGH: You heard something. Your imagination did the rest. 
254,TEGAN: Maybe. 
255,TURLOUGH: Let's go back. 
256,TEGAN: No! 
257,(They walk round a corner.) 
258,"TURLOUGH: Oh, no. "
259,(A metal contraption spots them and starts chirruping.) 
260, [Space liner bridge] 
261, (The two newcomers enter. Kari checks the
262,atmosphere then they both remove their helmets before going down the
263,steps to look at the equipment.) 
264,"KARI: The whole ship's rigged to run on automatic, yet there's"
265,atmosphere. It doesn't fit the briefing at all. 
266,OLVIR: So what? We're only here for the cargo. 
267,KARI: Would it really surprise you if there weren't any? This ship is
268,dead. 
269, [Space liner]
270,
271, (The Doctor and Nyssa arrive at the mended
272,breach.) 
273,DOCTOR: Ah. I don't remember this. We must have taken a wrong turn. 
274,NYSSA: What is it? 
275,DOCTOR: A massive plug. The hull must have been damaged at some time. 
276,NYSSA: It's still soft. 
277,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know. Come on, we'll try, er, this way. "
278, [Space liner bridge] 
279, (Kari uses her communicator.) 
280,KARI: Advance party to raider. We're coming back. This isn't the ship
281,you described. 
282,OLVIR: We can't go back if he doesn't link with the airlock. 
283,"DOCTOR : Er, this way. "
284, [Space liner]
285,
286," NYSSA: We're lost, aren't we. "
287,DOCTOR: Certainly not. 
288, [Space liner bridge] 
289, (It appears to be empty. Then Olvir comes up from
290,behind a console and points his weapon at the Doctor and Nyssa.) 
291,"DOCTOR: Oh, dear. So sorry, I didn't know it was private. "
292,(Kari appears behind them.) 
293,KARI: That's all right. We're in the mood for company. 
294, [Space liner]
295,
296, VOICE : Help me. 
297,TURLOUGH: Over there. 
298,VOICE : Help me. 
299,TEGAN: That's Nyssa! 
300,(Tegan goes to the door and starts pressing buttons on a panel.
301,"Meanwhile, the raider undocks from the spaceship.) "
302, [Space liner bridge] 
303, OLVIR: Kill them. We've enough problems. 
304,"KARI: Be quiet. If you're not members of the crew, how did you get"
305,here? 
306,DOCTOR: We have a ship of our own. 
307,"OLVIR: So they're after the cargo, too. "
308,KARI: Are you? 
309,DOCTOR: Unarmed? 
310,(The raider fires its engines.) 
311,OLVIR: Kari. 
312,KARI: Watch them. 
313,OLVIR: That's our ship! He's running out on us! 
314,KARI: Shut up. 
315,(She uses her communicator.) 
316,"KARI: Advance party to raider. Come in, raider. Come in. (static) Is"
317,this your work? 
318,DOCTOR: Hardly. 
319,(A console starts beeping.) 
320,DOCTOR: Neither is that. 
321, [Space liner]
322,
323, TURLOUGH: Engines. 
324,VOICE : Please help me. 
325,"TEGAN: Hold on, Nyssa. We must find something to lever the door open. "
326,TURLOUGH: Let's get out of here. 
327,TEGAN: Find a pry bar. Now! 
328,"(Turlough goes down the corridor to get instructions, but the crystal"
329,refuses to glow. He picks up Nyssa's notebook.) 
330,"TEGAN : Turlough, it's moving! "
331,TURLOUGH: On my way. 
332,(Turlough puts his hands against the bulkhead where the door originally
333,was.) 
334,TEGAN : Turlough! 
335,TURLOUGH: I'm coming! 
336,"(Turlough starts to walk away, and the skull motif appears.) "
337,TEGAN : Turlough! 
338,(Tegan has got the door slightly open.) 
339,TEGAN: Turlough 
340,(Hands reach through the gap and grab her all over. Turlough runs
341,back.) 
342,TEGAN: Help me! 
343,(Turlough pulls her out of their grasp and the door closes again.) 
344,TURLOUGH: Are you all right? I found the doorway to the Tardis. 
345,TEGAN: Where? 
346,TURLOUGH: This way. Come on. 
347,(The doorway fades again.) 
348, [Space liner bridge] 
349, NYSSA: Who are they? 
350,"DOCTOR: Raiders, by the look of it. Probably an advance party to open"
351,the airlocks. 
352,KARI: You say you have a ship? 
353,DOCTOR: Yes. 
354,KARI: I'm commandeering it. 
355,DOCTOR: I think not. 
356,(Kari and Olvir point their guns at Nyssa.) 
357,DOCTOR: Stop bluffing. You haven't got a chance. Listen to the engines.
358,Alignment manoeuvres. We're docking with another ship. 
359,"KARI: Then I'm asking you, will you take us off this ship? "
360,"DOCTOR: If you put the guns away, please. "
361,"(After a moment's hesitation, they holster their weapons.) "
362,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
363,TANNOY: All decks stand by. All decks stand by. This is a special
364,announcement from Terminus Incorporated. 
365,DOCTOR: I think we should get out of here. Follow me. 
366,"(The Doctor, Nyssa, Kari and Olvir run up the steps and leave.) "
367,TANNOY: Primary docking alignment procedures are now complete.
368,Passengers with mobility should prepare to disembark. 
369, [Space liner]
370,
371, TANNOY: Anyone failing to disembark will be
372,removed. Sterilisation procedures will then follow. 
373,(Tegan and Turlough watch as all the skull motif doors in the corridor
374,"open, and groaning voices can be heard..) "
375,TANNOY: There is no return. This is Terminus. 
376,OLVIR: Wait a minute. 
377,KARI: Olvir? 
378,OLVIR: I know where we are. 
379,(Olvir runs away.) 
380,KARI: Where? 
381,"(A crowd of cloaked people shuffle past, groaning. Meanwhile -) "
382,TEGAN: They're everywhere. 
383,(Turlough starts to prise open a floor plate.) 
384,"TURLOUGH: Give me a hand. Come on, quickly. "
385,(Tegan and Turlough get under the floor before the crowd arrives. The
386,Doctor and Nyssa watch from a staircase. Olvir has run back to the
387,bridge entrance.) 
388,"OLVIR: Now we know, don't we? Now we know what its all about. "
389, [Space liner bridge] 
390," OLVIR: This is Terminus, where all the lazars come"
391,to die. 
392, [Space liner]
393,
394, OLVIR : We're on a leper ship! We're all going
395,to die! 
396, Part Two
397,
398, [Space liner]
399,
400, (The spaceship docks with a massive space
401,station.) 
402,NYSSA: Lazars? 
403,"DOCTOR: Whatever you do, don't let them touch you. "
404,"(Ah, so that's why Nyssa is only wearing a sleeveless top with her"
405,miniskirt. Kari has got her gun out.) 
406,DOCTOR: No! That would be mass slaughter. 
407,KARI: I thought they were going to attack us. 
408,"DOCTOR: Look at them. I doubt if they can feed themselves, let alone"
409,fight. 
410,NYSSA: What about Olvir? 
411,KARI: He ran. Leave him. 
412,DOCTOR: No. I rather think he's got a lot to tell us. 
413, [Under the floor plate] 
414, TURLOUGH: It's stuck. 
415,TEGAN: It can't be. 
416,TURLOUGH: It's those things walking over the grating. 
417,TEGAN: There must be another way out. 
418,"(She starts to crawl along and a panel falls open, glowing green.) "
419,TEGAN: This place is a death trap. 
420,(They crawl off in the other direction.) 
421, [Space liner bridge] 
422, KARI: What are the lazars doing here? 
423,DOCTOR: Dying. Some cargo you came to steal. 
424,NYSSA: Why did you choose this ship? 
425,KARI: It was a big liner from a rich sector. It looked like the perfect
426,"target, so we thought. "
427,DOCTOR: Indeed. 
428,(The Doctor gets a monitor working.) 
429,"DOCTOR: Now, what about Terminus? We must find Olvir. "
430,NYSSA: We could try the computer. 
431, [Under the  Space
432,liner floor plates] 
433, TURLOUGH: Is there any way through? 
434,TEGAN: Solid. 
435,TURLOUGH: We'll have to go back. 
436,TEGAN: Wait. There's a ladder. This way. 
437, [Space liner bridge] 
438, (The Doctor is rearranging chips in the computer
439,panel.) 
440,"KARI: Hurry, Doctor. I want to get off this ship as soon as possible. "
441,DOCTOR: In a moment. Can you see any more computer blocks? 
442,NYSSA: I'll look. 
443,KARI: What precisely are you looking for? 
444,"(Nyssa leans against the stair rails for a few moments to rest, then"
445,moves on.) 
446,"DOCTOR: Information about Terminus. There must be something here, the"
447,liner's just docked with it. 
448,(Nyssa sees Olvir hiding under behind a chair.) 
449,NYSSA: Olvir? 
450, [Access ladder] 
451, (Tegan climbs on as Turlough takes out his
452,crystal.) 
453,GUARDIAN : The Doctor still lives. You know the rewards for
454,success. I have other rewards for your failure. 
455,TEGAN : Turlough? 
456,TURLOUGH: Coming. 
457, [Space liner bridge] 
458, DOCTOR: Star charts. 
459,KARI: What's that in the middle? 
460,DOCTOR: Must be Terminus. Nyssa? 
461,NYSSA: Coming. Come and talk to the Doctor. We need your help. You know
462,about Terminus. 
463,OLVIR: Kari's there. 
464,NYSSA: Yes? 
465,"OLVIR: I'm supposed to be combat trained, and I ran away. "
466,NYSSA: I'm sure she'll understand. 
467,DOCTOR: What do you make of this? 
468,KARI: Not very much. 
469,"OLVIR: Whatever you're planning, you can forget it, because we're dead."
470,We're breathing in the disease at this very moment. 
471,KARI: You decided to come back. 
472,"NYSSA: Please, we need his help. "
473,DOCTOR: Nyssa's right. How do you know about Lazar's disease? 
474,OLVIR: My sister died of it. 
475,DOCTOR: On Terminus? 
476,"OLVIR: Yes. They supposedly offer a cure, but I've never met anyone who"
477,came back. 
478,DOCTOR: And you didn't try and find out why? 
479,OLVIR: From whom? A commercial company runs Terminus. They don't care
480,about anything apart from their profit. 
481,NYSSA: How are they allowed to get away with it? 
482,"OLVIR: They just play on irrational fear, just like the old plagues."
483,They terrified people and this is no different. It isn't something you
484,admit to. 
485,DOCTOR: What do you make of this? 
486,OLVIR: An expanded chart of the universe. 
487,"DOCTOR: In all you heard about Terminus, was there ever any comment on"
488,its position? 
489,"OLVIR: No, not that I recall. "
490,DOCTOR: There's something very strange about this. 
491,OLVIR: What? 
492,"DOCTOR: Well, it could be pure coincidence, but Terminus seems to be at"
493,the exact centre of the known universe. 
494, [Under the  Space
495,liner floor plates] 
496," (Turlough catches up with Tegan, who still cannot"
497,move any floor plates to get out.) 
498,TURLOUGH: I'm so unfit. Any luck? 
499,TEGAN: I can hear something. 
500,"(A figure in full body armour decorated like a skeleton, wearing a red"
501,"cloak tied above the head like a shroud, stops right above them before"
502,moving on to the robotic device seen earlier.) 
503,TEGAN: What was it? 
504,"(The robot chirps its report, and the figure raises his face plate to"
505,show pale skin and sunken eyes.) 
506,EIRAK: Sterilise. 
507,TURLOUGH: Come on. 
508,(Tegan and Turlough crawl on through what I hesitate to call the
509,Jefferies tubes.) 
510, [Stockyard] 
511, (Another armoured figure with a brown cloak looks
512,at a display panel and his PADD then removes his helmet.) 
513,BOR: What's happening? The reading's still climbing. 
514,(He wanders off through an opening with black and yellow markings
515,around it. Valgard enters.) 
516,"VALGARD: Bor! No, Bor! "
517,(Valgard stops at the markings.) 
518,BOR: The reading's still climbing. I must find out what's happening. 
519, [Vanir's room] 
520, (Valgard rushes in.) 
521,"VALGARD: Eirak, Bor has just entered the Forbidden Zone. "
522,"EIRAK: Oh, that's all we need. "
523,VALGARD: We must do something. 
524,EIRAK: I can't afford to send men after him. 
525,VALGARD: We must do something! 
526,EIRAK: This is my responsibility. To keep Terminus running. 
527,VALGARD: We can't just let him die. 
528,"EIRAK: Valgard, we're all dying. Did Bor say anything before he entered"
529,the Zone? 
530,VALGARD: He muttered something about the readings. 
531,"EIRAK: He'll be back, when he gets hungry or needs his Hydromel. "
532, [Space liner bridge] 
533, DOCTOR: This could be useful. Plan of the ship. 
534,NYSSA: It's vast. 
535,DOCTOR: It's no wonder we got lost. 
536,(The power goes off.) 
537,KARI: Everybody down. 
538,NYSSA: What's happening? 
539,DOCTOR: Look. 
540,TANNOY: Attention. Preparations for departure will begin with stage one
541,sterilisation. Unprotected personnel are advised to leave this liner
542,immediately. No return will be permitted. This warning is final. Stage
543,one sterilisation is now commencing. 
544,DOCTOR: We must get out of here. 
545, [Under the  Space

547, (There's a hissing sound near Turlough and Tegan.)
548,
549,TURLOUGH: Now what? 
550,TEGAN: Back. 
551,(Gas starts to fill the area.) 
552,TEGAN: Must be to do with the sterilising. 
553, [Space liner bridge] 
554, KARI: Who was that voice talking to? 
555,OLVIR: A crew that doesn't exist. 
556,(Nyssa takes a piece of punch tape from a printer.) 
557,NYSSA: This is a layout of the ship. There are two ways back to where
558,we think the Tardis is. We must go in two parties. 
559, [Under the  Space
560,liner floor plates] 
561, TEGAN: We were lucky. It got vented away. 
562, [Space liner]
563,
564, NYSSA: I must rest. 
565,OLVIR: We can't. Come on. 
566,NYSSA: Please. 
567,"OLVIR: All right then, but only for a moment. What's the matter? "
568,NYSSA: I'm ill. 
569,OLVIR: Oh. I'll get help. 
570,(He takes out his communicator.) 
571,OLVIR: There's leak interference. There must be bad shielding on the
572,engine somewhere. 
573,NYSSA: Look. 
574,(The robot enters.) 
575,OLVIR: Can you walk? 
576,"NYSSA: I don't know. I feel, I feel as if I'm going to burst. "
577,(Nyssa unfastens her mini-skirt and lets it drop to the floor.
578,Fortunately she is wearing a slip underneath it.) 
579,OLVIR: Come on. 
580,"(Olvir puts his hand on Nyssa's shoulder, then pulls away.) "
581,"NYSSA: What's wrong? Olvir, what's wrong? "
582,OLVIR: You're contaminated. 
583,(The robot approaches.) 
584,TANNOY: Attention. 
585,(Kari and the Doctor hear the announcement too.) 
586,TANNOY: All Lazars and any other personnel must disembark immediately.
587,Stage two sterilisation is about to begin. 
588,(The robot grabs Nyssa's wrist.) 
589,"NYSSA: No, please. "
590,TANNOY: All other must leave immediately. 
591,(The robot starts to drag Nyssa away.) 
592,"NYSSA: Olvir, help me. "
593,TANNOY: All Lazars must comply with the drones. 
594,NYSSA: Olvir! 
595,TANNOY: All Lazars must comply with the drones. 
596,(Olvir looks away.) 
597,NYSSA: Olvir! 
598, [Under the  Space
599,liner floor plates] 
600, TURLOUGH: I feel sick. 
601,TEGAN: We haven't got time. Come on. 
602, [Receiving area] 
603, (The guards are bringing in Lazars.) 
604,SIGURD: What did Eirak say? 
605,VALGARD: He doesn't care about Bor. 
606,"SIGURD: Get in there. Valgard, don't anger Eirak. He has great power. "
607,VALGARD: The only power he has is in the control of the Hydromel.
608,"Without that, we're all dead. "
609,SIGURD: Be careful. 
610,(The door opens to reveal Nyssa.) 
611,SIGURD: This one's in better condition than most. 
612,VALGARD: Not for much longer. 
613,"(Valgard leads Nyssa to the other Lazars, and stumbles.) "
614,VALGARD: Where's that drone with the Hydromel? 
615,SIGURD: I'll check. 
616,"VALGARD: Well, hurry. They've started sterilising. "
617,(Sigurd leaves.) 
618,NYSSA: Where are you taking me? 
619,VALGARD: They don't usually speak. 
620,NYSSA: I'm not one of the Lazars. 
621,VALGARD: Your appearance says otherwise. 
622,NYSSA: Are you doctors? 
623,VALGARD: Baggage handlers. We just receive and pass on. 
624,NYSSA: But I have to know what's happening. 
625,"VALGARD: You'll be taken to the Garm. Thereafter, who knows? No one's"
626,ever come back from a meeting with him. 
627, [Vanir's room] 
628, (Sigurd hits a wall panel and another one labelled
629,Hazard opens. He removes a large box. That in turn holds four boxes
630,which each contain several layers of three recycled Blake's 7 mutoid
631,"serum phials, which glow lime green. Sigurd swaps a new one for the old"
632,one in his breast plate.) 
633,SIGURD: Bitter sweet taste of life. 
634, [Receiving area] 
635, NYSSA: Why do you wear armour? 
636,VALGARD: Radiation levels. What are you doing? 
637,NYSSA: I've cut my thumb. Look. 
638,"(As Valgard leans over to look, Nyssa gets her hand under his chin and"
639,pushes him away. She starts to run but Sigurd comes back with the box
640,of phials.) 
641,"SIGURD: The Garm awaits. There's no escape, not for you. All right,"
642,Valgard? 
643,VALGARD: Only my pride damaged. 
644,"(Olvir watches them take Nyssa away to a simple platform elevator, and"
645,go down.) 
646, [Lift shaft] 
647, NYSSA: What is this horrendous place? 
648, [Space liner]
649,
650, DOCTOR: We can't have missed the door. There was a
651,book lying on the floor. 
652,(The Doctor finds Nyssa's skirt by a staircase.) 
653,"DOCTOR: Nyssa's skirt. There's blood on it. Call Olvir, quickly. "
654, [Under the  Space
655,liner floor plates] 
656, TURLOUGH: Shush. 
657,TEGAN: What is it? 
658,TURLOUGH: It's the Doctor. 
659, [Terminus] 
660, (Sigurd and Valgard bring Nyssa in.) 
661,EIRAK: Has anybody told the Garm to look out for Bor in the Forbidden
662,Zone? 
663,SIGURD: Not yet. 
664,"EIRAK: If he dies, we'll want his body back for the armour. Valgard,"
665,see to it at once. 
666,SIGURD: I'll see to the Lazar. 
667,"(Sigurd takes Nyssa away. Valgard gives Eirak a long, hard stare before"
668,leaving.) 
669, [Stockyard] 
670," (With his face mask down, Valgard waves his hand"
671,"over a communication unit, which starts beeping. After a few moments a"
672,figure with glowing red eyes emerges from the Forbidden Zone and stops
673,behind the black and yellow markings.) 
674,"VALGARD: Garm, can you hear me? "
675,"(The biped, with the face of a giant Highland Terrier and forward"
676,"pointing ears, nods.) "
677,VALGARD: One of the Vanir has entered the Forbidden Zone. If he has
678,"died, we must have his body back. You understand? "
679,(The Garm bows.) 
680,VALGARD: And quickly! 
681, [Space liner]
682,
683, DOCTOR: More spots of blood. Try them again. 
684,KARI: There must be a radiation leak. 
685,DOCTOR: That's the wave pattern the Tardis homed in on. 
686, [Under the  Space
687,liner floor plates] 
688, TURLOUGH: Doctor? 
689,"TEGAN: Doctor! Doctor, we're here! "

691,TEGAN: Doctor! 
692, [Space liner]
693,
694," TEGAN : Doctor, over here! "
695,DOCTOR: Someone's calling. 
696,KARI: Look. 
697,(Gas is beginning to enter the corridor.) 
698,KARI: What is it? 
699,DOCTOR: Stage two sterilisation. Come on! 
700, [Reception area] 
701, (The Doctor and Kari dive under the closing door
702,between the spaceship and Terminus just in time.) 
703,KARI: Now where? 
704,DOCTOR: Down there. 
705,(The lights go out.) 
706, [Stockyard] 
707, (Valgard watches the Doctor and Kari walk along an
708,upper catwalk.) 
709,DOCTOR: The centre of the universe. 
710,(Valgard goes after them.) 
711, [Under the  Space
712,liner floor plates] 
713, TURLOUGH: He couldn't have heard us. We're going
714,to get out of here even if we have to smash our way out. 
715,"(The third bar he tries to move gives way, and they carry on.) "
716, [Stockyard] 
717, KARI: You realise that Nyssa and Olvir could have
718,found the Tardis by now. 
719,DOCTOR: Then why don't they reply? Tell me. The star charts on the
720,"liner, do you think they were accurate? "
721,KARI: I don't know. They were probably 
722,(The Doctor looks round from his examination of the communications unit
723,to see Kari with Valgard's staff across her throat.) 
724,DOCTOR: Let her go! 
725,(Valgard drops Kari.) 
726,"VALGARD: Now it's your turn, only you I'm going to kill. "
727,(Valgard proceeds to strangle the Doctor.) 
728, Part Three
729,
730, [Stockyard] 
731, (The Doctor manages to break Valgard's grip on his
732,"throat, while Kari recovers her gun. Valgard has the Doctor from behind"
733,"now, and she can't get a clear shot.) "
734,DOCTOR: I'd appreciate some help. 
735,(Kari fires her energy beam at a piece of metal leaning against the
736,wall. It reflects off it and straight onto Valgard's helmet. He screams
737,and releases the Doctor before collapsing.) 
738,KARI: Is it a machine? 
739,DOCTOR: No. He's wearing radiation armour. Keep him covered. 
740,KARI: My power pack's dead. 
741,DOCTOR: Come on. 
742,(The Doctor leads Kari into the Forbidden Zone. Valgard recovers and
743,"sees where they have gone, and leaves. Meanwhile, Olvir hides from a"
744,pair of Vanir and discovers where they keep the spare armour. 
745,Turlough uses the bar to smash through a wall panel into a spaceship
746,corridor.) 
747, [Forbidden Zone] 
748," (Which looks just like the rest of Terminus,"
749,"actually, all metal staircases and scaffolding tubes.) "
750,DOCTOR: Let me have your radio. 
751,KARI: It's always the same pattern. 
752,"DOCTOR: Well, at least the level's acceptable, for the time being. Come"
753,on. 
754,(The Garm follows them.) 
755, [Lazar's pen] 
756, (Nyssa has been dressed in the same drab robe as
757,the rest of the Lazars.) 
758,NYSSA: Are you in charge? 
759,EIRAK: Be quiet. 
760,NYSSA: Please listen. 
761,EIRAK: Shut the door. 
762,(The Vanir leave. A female Lazar speaks to Nyssa.) 
763,INGA: You'll get nothing out of them. They're not interested. 
764,NYSSA: I've got to make them understand. 
765,INGA: You can't even bribe them. The only thing they care about is
766,"Hydromel, the drug that keeps them alive. "
767,NYSSA: What are they going to do with us? 
768,"INGA: Supposedly cure us, but I rather think they're going to let us"
769,die. 
770, [Vanir's room] 
771," (Eirak replenishes his own Hydromel supply, makes"
772,"a note on a PADD, then discovers a pale phial in the box. Sigurd enters"
773,with a clip board.) 
774,"SIGURD: Lazar assessment from tank three, Eirak. "
775,(Eirak throws the phial on the floor.) 
776,EIRAK: Coloured water. They must think we're fools. They've even
777,reduced the size of the consignment. 
778,SIGURD: Why the cutback? 
779,EIRAK: Maybe our performance is down. 
780,SIGURD: But we process everyone who comes here. Why doesn't the Company
781,send someone to see the conditions we work under? 
782,EIRAK: Maybe they already have. We are slaves. The Company doesn't need
783,to tell us anything. 
784,(Valgard enters.) 
785,"VALGARD: Intruders. I saw two people down in the stockyard, a man and a"
786,girl. They went into the Forbidden Zone. 
787,EIRAK: Lazars? 
788,"VALGARD: No. No, they were too fit. And they were armed. "
789,SIGURD: Agents from the Company. 
790,EIRAK: Why didn't you stop them? 
791,VALGARD: I tried. 
792,SIGURD: Why are they in the Forbidden Zone? 
793,EIRAK: The perfect place to hide. We never go there. As the Company has
794,"decided to cut back our supply of Hydromel, it is in our own interest"
795,"to learn why. If the couple in the Forbidden Zone are from the Company,"
796,their knowledge is vital. 
797,VALGARD: How do we find them? 
798,EIRAK: Someone must go after them. 
799,VALGARD: Why don't you? You're supposed to be our honoured leader. 
800,EIRAK: I'm needed here. 
801,"VALGARD: So you keep telling us, although I sometimes wonder whether we"
802,need you at all. 
803,SIGURD: Valgard! 
804,EIRAK: You think you could be better? 
805,VALGARD: Yes. 
806,"EIRAK: All right, I'll make you an offer. Bring back the spies and I'll"
807,step down in your favour. 
808,VALGARD: I have your word on that? 
809,EIRAK: You have the Vanir as your witness. Think of it as a bet. If
810,"you're ambitious enough, you'll accept it. "
811,"VALGARD: All right, agreed. "
812,EIRAK: Then go! 
813,(Valgard leaves.) 
814,SIGURD: He'll die in the Forbidden Zone. 
815,EIRAK: He hates me. He'll succeed. 
816,SIGURD: And you will give him what you say? 
817,EIRAK: Of course. 
818, [Lazar's pen] 
819, (Nyssa gives up trying to open the door.) 
820,"INGA: There's no way out, just as there's no cure. It's hopeless. "
821,NYSSA: Tell me about the Forbidden Zone. 
822,"INGA: You don't give up, do you. "
823,NYSSA: Tell me. 
824,INGA: I only know what I've heard. It's where the radiation's too
825,"strong for them, and where we're supposed to be cured. "
826,NYSSA: And what's the Garm? 
827,INGA: You'll find out soon enough. 
828, [Equipment store] 
829, (Olvir is wearing a cloak and looking for a
830,serviceable helmet. He has his back to the door when Sigurd enters.) 
831,SIGURD: They're starting to move the Lazars. Tank three. 
832,OLVIR: I'll be down in a moment. 
833,(Turlough and Tegan sneak under the camera view of a drone.) 
834, [Vanir's room] 
835, SIGURD: I've just come from the equipment store. I
836,think we have a third intruder. 
837,EIRAK: Excellent. Carry on with those. 
838,(Two Vanir leave.) 
839,"EIRAK: It seems Valgard's mission was unnecessary after all. Come on,"
840,we'll apprehend this one ourselves. 
841, [Forbidden Zone] 
842, DOCTOR: Why do the crew put up with such a
843,radiation leak? 
844,KARI: It could be part of the cure. 
845,"DOCTOR: Olvir said there wasn't one. So, why don't they repair it? "
846,KARI: They may not know how to. 
847,DOCTOR: Hmm. Radiation. Fallout. Now that's a thought. 
848,KARI: What? 
849,DOCTOR: Nothing. Just an idea worth pursuing. 
850, [Equipment room] 
851, EIRAK: You. Turn around. 
852,(The cloaked figure does not move. Eirak goes over and knocks the dummy
853,down.) 
854,EIRAK: You fool. 
855,SIGURD: But it spoke. 
856,EIRAK: Perhaps you're developing the Lazar disease. 
857, [Stockyard] 
858, (Olvir enters. Valgard throws down his helmet.) 
859,VALGARD: I'm going. 
860,(Valgard enters the Forbidden Zone.) 
861, [Lazar's pen] 
862, (Eirak examines Nyssa's face.) 
863,"EIRAK: It's hardly touched. Take her first, then. "
864,SIGURD: You. 
865,(A Vanir comes over and takes Nyssa's arm.) 
866,"NYSSA: No. No, wait. Others are worse than me. "
867,EIRAK: The fit ones go first. Take her. 
868,"NYSSA: No. No, please. No. "
869, [Forbidden Zone] 
870, DOCTOR: What is it? 
871,KARI: I can hear someone singing. 
872, [Space liner]
873,
874, (Tegan and Turlough are sitting disconsolately on
875,a staircase.) 
876,TURLOUGH: Tegan. 
877,TEGAN: What? 
878,"TURLOUGH: If ever you had to kill someone, could you do it? Could you? "
879,"TEGAN: No. I don't know. If it was important, to save my friend, to"
880,defend myself. 
881,TURLOUGH: But cold-bloodedly? 
882,"TEGAN: You're weird, Turlough. What a subject to bring up at a time"
883,"like this. Come on, let's find the control room. "
884,(Tegan leaves.) 
885,"GUARDIAN : You are a fool, boy. "
886, [Forbidden Zone] 
887," (The 'singer' is Bor, dragging some heavy metal"
888,pieces along in his cloak.) 
889,KARI: Who is it? 
890,"DOCTOR: Well, he seems happy enough. Let's find out. "
891,KARI: No. 
892,"DOCTOR: He's hurt. Hello, I'm the Doctor. Can I help? "
893,"BOR: Most kind. Yes. A burden is a, er, something or other. Most kind."
894,Thanks. This way. 
895,(Bor gives the Doctor the end of the cloak and goes off mumbling.) 
896,BOR: The cold ground. Rest in peace. 
897, [Space liner bridge] 
898, TURLOUGH: Curious. What do you make of this? 
899,TEGAN: It's a map. Like one of those diagrams when they thought the
900,Earth was at the centre of the universe. 
901,"TURLOUGH: Hmm. Strange, isn't it. "
902, [Forbidden Zone - engine room]
903,
904," (Still sort of singing, Bor leads the Doctor and"
905,Kari along.) 
906,DOCTOR: Terminus entrance. At least we know where the radiation comes
907,from. 
908,(Bor starts to pile the metal up against a barricade in front of a
909,large glowing object in the wall.) 
910,DOCTOR: Look at the damage. Easy now. 
911,(They drag Bor away.) 
912,"BOR: Thank you. Most kind. Most kind. My name is, er, Bor. I. Haven't"
913,we met somewhere before? 
914,DOCTOR: Indeed. I'm the Doctor. 
915,BOR: Short term memory's the first to go. 
916,KARI: He needs a medic. 
917,BOR: Do you know anything about engines? 
918,DOCTOR: A little. 
919,BOR: I tried to pull down the control cables. I picked the wrong ones.
920,"Power lines. As I couldn't stop the radiation, I had to try and wall it"
921,in. Now things are even worse. 
922,DOCTOR: In what way? 
923,BOR: The whole lot's unstable. Know what would happen if one of those
924,exploded? It'd be more than just a loud bang. 
925,DOCTOR: Chain reaction. 
926,BOR: Nothing in the universe would be safe. 
927,KARI: What? 
928,BOR: Did I tell you? One of the engines has already exploded. 
929,DOCTOR: When? 
930,"BOR: No, oh, it was a long time ago. It's all in the computer. That one"
931,will go next. I didn't find out why until I followed the control
932,cables. 
933,KARI: Why wasn't Terminus destroyed in the explosion? 
934,BOR: Terminus is protected. 
935,"VALGARD: Tell them nothing, Bor. They're Company spies. "
936,BOR: Really? They seemed so friendly. 
937,(Kari levels her gun at Valgard.) 
938,VALGARD: You forget our last encounter. The power pack is exhausted.
939,"I'm taking you back, but not before I've beaten some respect into you. "
940,"(The Doctor dodges the first two swings, then takes a blow on the arm"
941,"from Valgard's staff. A few more swipes, and the Doctor grabs the"
942,"staff. There is a brief trial of strength, and Valgard is thrown"
943,against the barricade in front of the engine.) 
944,BOR: My wall! 
945,(The Doctor goes to help Bor and Valgard. The Garm enters.) 
946,KARI: Doctor! 
947, [Stockyard] 
948, (Nyssa is being shackled to a pipe.) 
949,"NYSSA: Let me go. Please, please, let me go. "
950,SIGURD: Don't you want to be cured? This is for your own good. 
951,"NYSSA: Please, let me go. "
952,(Sigurd summons the Garm.) 
953,"SIGURD: At least, that's what I'm told. "
954, [Forbidden Zone - engine room]
955,
956, (The Garm has picked up Bor.) 
957,KARI: What's that? 
958,DOCTOR: Some sort of signal. 
959,"(The Garm leaves, carrying Bor in its arms.) "
960,DOCTOR: Come on. 
961,(The Doctor and Kari leave. Valgard wakes up.) 
962, [Stockyard] 
963, (Nyssa screams.) 
964,NYSSA: No! What is that thing? 
965,SIGURD: Your cure. The Garm's found Bor. 
966,BOR: Most kind. 
967,SIGURD: Let's get him to Eirak while he can still talk. 
968,"(Two Vanir carry Bor out, followed by Sigurd. Olvir goes to Nyssa) "
969,OLVIR: Let's see that chain. 
970,NYSSA: No! 
971,(Olvir takes off his helmet.) 
972,"OLVIR: It's me, Nyssa. "
973,NYSSA: Quickly! Quick. 
974,"OLVIR: I can't, I'm not strong enough. "
975,(The Garm approaches.) 
976,NYSSA: Olvir! (Olvir fires his gun at the Garm. It has no effect. The
977,Garm goes to Nyssa.) 
978, [Forbidden Zone] 
979, KARI: What are you looking for now? 
980,DOCTOR: The control lines. The ones Bor said he followed. 
981,(The Garm has freed Nyssa and hoisted her over its shoulder. It carries
982,"her into the Forbidden Zone. After a moment, Olvir follows.) "
983, [Space liner bridge] 
984, TURLOUGH: There must be a way to recreate the door
985,we entered this ship by. Wait here. 
986, [Terminus] 
987, KARI: This is a complete waste of time. Bor
988,doesn't know what he's talking about. He's suffering from radiation
989,sickness. 
990,"DOCTOR: Yes, you're right about the sickness. I want to find out what"
991,he discovered. 
992,KARI: Does it matter? 
993,DOCTOR: I think it could be rather important. 
994, [Vanir's room] 
995," SIGURD: Bor, can you hear me? "
996,BOR: Sigurd? 
997,SIGURD: Why did you do it? You knew you couldn't survive in the
998,Forbidden Zone. 
999,"BOR: Worth a try. The pilot's dead, you know. "
1000,SIGURD: Pilot? 
1001,BOR: Of Terminus. 
1002,SIGURD: What? 
1003,BOR: But he's still there. He's going to fire up the engines again and
1004,they won't take it and the big bang will happen all over again. 
1005,EIRAK: Where's his helmet? 
1006,SIGURD: He didn't have it. He's delirious. He needs Hydromel. 
1007,EIRAK: There isn't any to spare. 
1008,SIGURD: But he's dying. 
1009,EIRAK: So why detain him? 
1010, [Space liner]
1011,
1012, (Turlough gets out the crystal.) 
1013,GUARDIAN : You have not destroyed the Doctor. 
1014,TURLOUGH: I haven't found him yet. 
1015,"(Turlough suddenly stiffens, writhes and falls to his knees.) "
1016,GUARDIAN : Kill the Doctor. 
1017,"TURLOUGH: I will, I will. I have a plan. "
1018,GUARDIAN : You have nothing. 
1019,TURLOUGH: I do! But I need to get back to the Tardis. 
1020,GUARDIAN : Why? 
1021,TURLOUGH: Trust me. 
1022,TEGAN : Turlough! 
1023,TURLOUGH: How do I recreate the door? 
1024,GUARDIAN : Fail me again 
1025,"TURLOUGH: I won't, I promise. "
1026,GUARDIAN : Then search for an emergency bypass switch. 
1027,TURLOUGH: Where? 
1028,GUARDIAN : You have skills. Use them. Look beneath your feet. 
1029,(The crystal goes out. Tegan comes up.) 
1030,TEGAN: What are you doing? 
1031,"TURLOUGH: Remember when we were underneath the floor? Well, I noticed"
1032,something familiar. It's only just come to me what it was. Come on. 
1033, [Terminus bridge] 
1034, (The Doctor is still following the cable on the
1035,wall.) 
1036,DOCTOR: Terminus control. 
1037,KARI: Look. 
1038,"(There is a mummified pilot in the main seat just like in Alien, and a"
1039,second empty seat.) 
1040, [Terminus engine room] 
1041, (The Garm is tying Nyssa up in front of the
1042,engine.) 
1043,NYSSA: Olvir! 
1044,(Valgard hits Olvir in the stomach with his staff.) 
1045, [Terminus bridge] 
1046, DOCTOR: Do you remember Bor saying one of the
1047,engines had exploded? 
1048,KARI: Did he? 
1049,DOCTOR: He was wrong. It didn't come to that. Look at this. Terminus
1050,was once capable of time travel. 
1051,KARI: So? 
1052,"DOCTOR: Well, to push a ship of this size through time would require an"
1053,enormous amount of energy. 
1054,KARI: What are you getting at? 
1055,"DOCTOR: Well, think about what we've learnt. Terminus seems to be at"
1056,"the centre of the universe, yes? Now, imagine this ship in flight."
1057,Suddenly the pilot finds he has an enormous amount of unstable fuel on
1058,board. What would you do? 
1059,KARI: Jettison it. 
1060,"DOCTOR: Perfectly normal procedure. Unfortunately, he ejects his fuel"
1061,into a void. 
1062,KARI: And it exploded. 
1063,DOCTOR: Starting a chain reaction. 
1064,KARI: How big? 
1065,DOCTOR: Enormous. Biggest explosion of all time. Event One. 
1066,KARI: The Big Bang? 
1067,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1068,KARI: It isn't possible. 
1069,DOCTOR: A chemical reaction in a primeval swamp can create life on a
1070,planet. Why couldn't the universe be created by a similar chance
1071,"factor, hmm? "
1072,KARI: But exploding fuel in space? It's almost too simple. 
1073,DOCTOR: It only appears simple because the circumstances were exactly
1074,right. 
1075,"KARI: Well, if what you're saying is right, why wasn't Terminus"
1076,destroyed in the explosion? 
1077,"DOCTOR: Well, the pilot time-jumped the ship forward before realising"
1078,how unstable the fuel was. The resulting shockwave must have caught up
1079,"with him, boosting the ship billions of years into the future. "
1080,KARI: Killing the pilot and damaging the second engine. 
1081,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1082,"KARI: If there was a second explosion, would it have the same effect as"
1083,the jettisoned fuel? 
1084,"DOCTOR: Not quite. Whereas the first explosion created the universe,"
1085,the second would undoubtedly destroy it. 
1086, [Under the  Space
1087,liner floor plates] 
1088, (Turlough hammers at a 'No Touch' labelled panel
1089,until it falls off to reveal a green glow and some circuitry.) 
1090,TURLOUGH: There it is. Emergency bypass. We'll soon have that door
1091,open. 
1092,TEGAN: Where's the light coming from? 
1093,TURLOUGH: It's nothing. 
1094,(Turlough pulls at a wire. There's a big flash.) 
1095, [Terminus bridge] 
1096, (The Doctor and Kari stagger. A panel bursts into
1097,flames.) 
1098,KARI: What's happening? 
1099,"DOCTOR: I don't know. Oh, no. "
1100,KARI: What? 
1101,DOCTOR: It wasn't the pilot's decision. The computer's just started an
1102,automatic sequence to jettison the unstable fuel. If we don't do
1103,"something quickly, the whole universe will be destroyed. "
1104, Part Four
1105,
1106, [Terminus bridge] 
1107, DOCTOR: We must stop the sequence. 
1108,(The Doctor takes off his jacket.) 
1109,KARI: Do you know how? 
1110,DOCTOR: Not yet. 
1111,"KARI: What, then? "
1112,(A red handle moves forward a notch.) 
1113, [Terminus engine room] 
1114, VALGARD: Where are the others? 
1115,OLVIR: What? 
1116,VALGARD: Spies! 
1117,"(Valgard takes some more swipes at Olvir with his staff, and misses."
1118,The Garm enters and Nyssa screams. Valgard and Olvir fight hand to
1119,hand. Olvir defeats Valgard as the Garm carries Nyssa off.) 
1120,"OLVIR: Oh, no. Nyssa! "
1121, [Under the  Space
1122,liner floor plates] 
1123, TEGAN: Are you all right? 
1124,TURLOUGH: I think so. 
1125,TEGAN: What happened? 
1126,TURLOUGH: I don't know. 
1127,(There is a humming sound.) 
1128,TURLOUGH: Look! 
1129,"(Above them, in the corridor, the skull motif appears briefly on a wall"
1130,panel.) 
1131,TEGAN: We must make it materialise fully. 
1132,(They go back to the circuitry.) 
1133,TURLOUGH: It won't move. 
1134,TEGAN: Let me help. It's not going to defeat us now. 
1135, [Terminus engine room] 
1136, (Olvir reaches for a gun on the floor near the
1137,engine.) 
1138,VALGARD: I wouldn't. The radiation'll kill you. Get much closer and
1139,"you're dead, unless you can get to a decontamination unit. "
1140,OLVIR: You're lying. 
1141,"VALGARD: Please yourself, then, but in my day we were better trained. "
1142,OLVIR: What? 
1143,VALGARD: You're not from the Company. You're combat trained. Colonel
1144,"Pereira, was it? The one they call the Chief? "
1145,OLVIR: How do you know? 
1146,VALGARD: Recognise the moves. Taught the same ones to me. I was with
1147,"him for five tours, till he turned me in for the reward. "
1148,OLVIR: And how did you get here? 
1149,VALGARD: Slave labour. That's how Terminus works. You couldn't pay
1150,anyone enough to work here. 
1151,OLVIR: Where are the guards? 
1152,"VALGARD: Don't need them. If we don't work, we don't get the Hydromel"
1153,"we need to stay alive. Help me, please. Oh, come on. Look at me. I'm a"
1154,danger to no one. I'm finished. I'm dying. 
1155,OLVIR: Where did that thing take Nyssa? 
1156,"VALGARD: Nyssa? Oh, is that her name? I've no idea. This is my first"
1157,time in the Zone. 
1158,OLVIR: Will he harm her? 
1159,VALGARD: No. He's curing her. That's what he's here for. 
1160,OLVIR: How can that thing cure anyone? 
1161,VALGARD: Help me. I'll show you. 
1162,OLVIR: I'll find her myself. 
1163,VALGARD: Don't leave me. 
1164,"(Olvir picks up his cloak and runs off. Valgard smiles and gets up,"
1165,then uses his staff to drag the gun away from the engine.) 
1166, [Terminus bridge] 
1167, (The Doctor and Kari are trying to push the red
1168,handle back to where it started.) 
1169,KARI: Why won't it move? 
1170,"DOCTOR: It's controlled by the computer, and the computer's"
1171,uncontrollable. 
1172, [Under the  Space
1173,liner floor plates] 
1174, TEGAN: I don't think I've got any skin left on my
1175,hands. 
1176,TANNOY: Primary ignition is now beginning. All systems running on test.
1177,Departure sequence is beginning now. 
1178,TEGAN: What's happening? 
1179,TURLOUGH: The liner's preparing to move. 
1180,"TEGAN: No, wait! You can't leave yet! "
1181,TANNOY: All drones to designated assembly points. Countdown to
1182,secondary ignition follows. 
1183,TEGAN: No! 
1184,"TURLOUGH: The ship's on automatic, Tegan. There's nothing you can do. "
1185,TEGAN: I've got to try. 
1186, [Space liner  bridge]
1187,
1188, TANNOY: Departure sequence is now underway.
1189,Countdown to docking disengagement now beginning. 
1190,(Tegan runs in and goes to the main control console.) 
1191,TANNOY: Preparing to blow clamps and withdraw all lines. 
1192,TEGAN: Can anyone hear me? 
1193,TANNOY: Countdown to primary burn is now underway. 
1194,TEGAN: You must stop! 
1195,TANNOY: Countdown to primary burn is now underway. 
1196,(The doorway fully materialises.) 
1197,TANNOY: Test mode on all systems is now disengaged. 
1198,(Tegan tries turning every available button.) 
1199,TANNOY: All systems operating within permitted tolerances. 
1200,TEGAN: Shut up! 
1201,(She hits a console with her fist.) 
1202,"TANNOY: Emergency, emergency. Launch abort. Launch abort. "
1203,TEGAN: I don't believe it. 
1204,TANNOY: Launch abort. 
1205, [Space liner]
1206,
1207, (The door into the Tardis is gently closing.) 
1208,TANNOY: Launch abort. Launch abort. 
1209,(Turlough runs into the console room. 
1210,Nyssa wakes up in a large white room. She appears to be cured.) 
1211, [Terminus bridge] 
1212, (The Doctor tries to move the handle back with a
1213,metal bar. It bends the bar.) 
1214,KARI: How can this ship still be operational after all this time? 
1215,"DOCTOR: The technology here is phenomenal, unfortunately. There must be"
1216,a way to reset that handle. 
1217,KARI: He must have had the strength of a giant. 
1218,DOCTOR: A giant. 
1219,KARI: Of course. 
1220,DOCTOR: The Garm. 
1221,KARI: But will there still be enough time? 
1222,"DOCTOR: Well, we can only hope there is. "
1223,(They run out. The handle moves forward another notch.) 
1224, [Tardis] 
1225, GUARDIAN [on scanner]: The Doctor still lives. 
1226,"TURLOUGH: He's trapped. He's powerless, probably dead already. "
1227,GUARDIAN [on scanner]: You represent a poor investment of my time and
1228,"energy, and for such an investment there is only one course to follow. "
1229,(A blinding flash comes from the Guardian's crystal. Turlough screams.)
1230,
1231, [Terminus] 
1232, (The Garm meets Olvir.) 
1233,OLVIR: I'm unarmed. Can you understand me? 
1234,GARM: Perfectly. 
1235,OLVIR: Why are you doing this? You're torturing people. 
1236,GARM: I draw the disease from them. All would die but most survive. 
1237,"OLVIR: And the last one you treated, Nyssa, did she survive? "
1238,GARM: She is recovering. 
1239,OLVIR: Where? 
1240,GARM: Follow me. 
1241, [Vanir's room] 
1242, BOR: If only I could remember. 
1243,SIGURD: Try to relax. 
1244,BOR: It doesn't matter. In a couple of hours there won't even be a
1245,Terminus or a Company or anything. I found some information in a
1246,computer. 
1247,SIGURD: What's going to happen? 
1248,BOR: That's the trouble. I can't remember. 
1249,"SIGURD: But Bor, you must. "
1250,BOR: Short term memory is always the first to go. 
1251,"SIGURD: Look, I'll get some Hydromel. There's a case of it through"
1252,there. 
1253,BOR: Eirak won't release any. 
1254,SIGURD: Who said I was going to ask him? 
1255,"(Sigurd checks that the coast is clear, and goes to the stack of"
1256,Hydromel boxes. They have been secured with a padlock that beeps when
1257,Sigurd tries to undo it.) 
1258,"BOR: It really isn't worth the trouble, you know. "
1259, [Stockyard] 
1260, (The Doctor takes the signalling device in hand.) 
1261,DOCTOR: You ready? 
1262,KARI: Call him. 
1263,(The beep fills the Forbidden Zone. 
1264,"Olvir tries to break into the room where Nyssa is recovering, dressed"
1265,"only in her skivvies again. She hides behind the door, ready to pounce."
1266,
1267,"Meanwhile, the red handle moves forward another notch.) "
1268, [Space liner]
1269,
1270, TEGAN: Turlough? Turlough? 
1271, [Stockyard] 
1272, KARI: He's coming. What do we do now? 
1273,DOCTOR: Let's just get into the control room. I'll do the rest. 
1274,KARI: And if he won't cooperate? 
1275,"DOCTOR: We'll humour him. Right, let's go. "
1276,(The signal stops and will not restart.) 
1277,KARI: It's not working. 
1278,"GARM: Deception is unnecessary. You have given the signal, I must obey."
1279,
1280, [Recovery room] 
1281, (Olvir breaks into the room and falls over Nyssa's
1282,leg. She leaps onto his chest.) 
1283,NYSSA: Olvir! 
1284,OLVIR: Nyssa! You came through the cure. 
1285,NYSSA: Just about. 
1286,OLVIR: What happened? 
1287,NYSSA: I was simply exposed to a massive dose of radiation. There's no
1288,"proper diagnosis, no control, and this is supposed to be someone's idea"
1289,of decontamination. 
1290,"OLVIR: Well, let's go. The sooner we can put Terminus behind us "
1291,NYSSA: You don't understand. There must be thousands of people who've
1292,passed through here and think they're cured. It's all just hit and
1293,miss. No one cares. 
1294,"OLVIR: Let's go, Nyssa. "
1295,"NYSSA: Listen to me. The cure works, but it needs to be controlled,"
1296,otherwise you just trade one killer for another. Radiation induced
1297,diseases that may take years to show. 
1298,"OLVIR: Let's just concentrate on getting away, shall we? "
1299,NYSSA: It could all be changed. 
1300,"OLVIR: I've no doubt you're right, but we can argue your case later."
1301,"Now come on, quickly. "
1302, [Stockyard] 
1303, (Another Lazar is being chained up when Eirak
1304,discovers that the Garm's summoning device has gone.) 
1305,EIRAK: Who took it? Who took the signal box? Someone will suffer for
1306,this. 
1307, [Terminus bridge] 
1308, DOCTOR: You understand what we need you to do? 
1309,(The red handle moves forward another notch.) 
1310,DOCTOR: I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry. 
1311,GARM: Is this necessary? 
1312,"DOCTOR: If you can return the lever, I can disconnect the computer"
1313,controlling it. 
1314,GARM: And if I fail? 
1315,DOCTOR: It's the end of the universe. 
1316,(The Garm grasps the handle.) 
1317, [Vanir's room] 
1318, (Terminus starts to shake.) 
1319,"BOR: Beginning of the end, boys. "
1320, [Terminus bridge] 
1321, (The Doctor starts to take apart computer panels.)
1322,
1323,KARI: Nothing's happening. 
1324,DOCTOR: It must. You must push harder. It's the only way. 
1325,KARI: Please. 
1326,(Nyssa and Olvir are thrown against the walls as the engine gets
1327,brighter and brighter. Finally the Garm gets the handle to move.) 
1328,KARI: It's working! 
1329,(The Garm returns the handle to its start position and the engine sound
1330,dies down.) 
1331,DOCTOR: That's it! 
1332,(The Doctor flicks some switches and pulls out a fistful of wires.) 
1333,GARM: Have I served you well? 
1334,DOCTOR: Indeed you have. 
1335,GARM: Do something for me. Destroy the box. Set me free. 
1336,(The Doctor picks up the signal box and smashes it on the floor.) 
1337,DOCTOR: Rest. You've earned it. Come on. 
1338,(The Doctor picks up his jacket and leaves with Kari.) 
1339, [Terminus] 
1340, KARI: What now? 
1341,DOCTOR: Disconnect the control lines to the engines. 
1342,(They meet Valgard and his gun.) 
1343,"DOCTOR: Look, whoever you are, we haven't got time for "
1344,VALGARD: Silence. Move. 
1345,(Nyssa and Olvir are on a lower level.) 
1346,DOCTOR: You're taking a very narrow view of all this. 
1347,NYSSA: It's the Doctor. 
1348,(Nyssa and Olvir hide as Valgard brings the Doctor and Kari down the
1349,stairs.) 
1350,"VALGARD: I want to stay alive. If that's a narrow view, then you're"
1351,right. 
1352,DOCTOR: You're quite happy to see things go on as they are. 
1353,VALGARD: Happy? This is Terminus. No one's happy here. Staying alive is
1354,all that counts. 
1355,DOCTOR: Things could change. 
1356,NYSSA: Over here! 
1357,(Valgard turns.) 
1358,OLVIR: Here! 
1359,(Olvir kicks the gun out of Valgard's hand and Kari picks it up.) 
1360,KARI: Freeze! 
1361,"DOCTOR: Nyssa, I've been so worried. "
1362,"NYSSA: I'm fine. Doctor, I've made a fantastic discovery. The cure for"
1363,Lazar disease works. 
1364,DOCTOR: How do you know? 
1365,NYSSA: Because I've been cured myself. 
1366,OLVIR: It seems I was wrong. 
1367,NYSSA: The system is far from safe. 
1368,"DOCTOR: Well, you think it could be? "
1369,"NYSSA: With the Garm's help, yes. It's only his lack of free will which"
1370,has prevented him from doing anything about it. 
1371,"DOCTOR: Well, he has it now. "
1372,VALGARD: She's sick. She doesn't know what she's talking about. 
1373,"NYSSA: With changes, Terminus could work, become a proper hospital. "
1374,VALGARD: The Company isn't interested. 
1375,"NYSSA: Are you, though? And the other Vanir? "
1376,"VALGARD: Even if we were, it's not possible without Hydromel, and it's"
1377,the Company who control that. 
1378,"NYSSA: But if you had an endless supply of it, you'd be free of their"
1379,"control, wouldn't you? "
1380, [Vanir's room] 
1381," (Bor wakes up, muttering.) "
1382,BOR: Am I dead yet? 
1383,SIGURD: No. 
1384,"BOR: Oh, funny, I could have sworn that. But still, it's a relief. I am"
1385,hoping for something rather better on the other side. Sigurd 
1386,SIGURD: Try to sleep. 
1387,BOR: Sleep? It's all I can do to keep awake for more than a minute. 
1388,SIGURD: Valgard! 
1389,VALGARD: Shush. I've got some people with me. 
1390,SIGURD: What's going on? 
1391,(They cross the room.) 
1392,VALGARD: Come in. 
1393,"(The Doctor, Nyssa, Kari and Olvir enter.) "
1394,DOCTOR: Where is it? 
1395,VALGARD: Here. 
1396,SIGURD: Now wait a minute. 
1397,VALGARD: They say they can free us from the Company. 
1398,SIGURD: You believe that? 
1399,VALGARD: You know anybody harder to convince? 
1400,"DOCTOR: It's locked. Olvir, may I borrow your laser? "
1401,SIGURD: Now if this is just some madcap scheme for getting back at
1402,"Eirak, then you've got another thing coming. "
1403,VALGARD: Wait. 
1404,(The Doctor lasers the padlock on the stack of Hydromel and give Olvir
1405,the gun back. Then he takes out a box and opens it.) 
1406,"DOCTOR: You're the expert, what do you think? "
1407,(Nyssa examines a phial.) 
1408,"DOCTOR: Look, er, while we're sorting things out here, perhaps you'd be"
1409,so good as to cut the control lines to the engines. I'd hate anyone to
1410,start the sequence manually. 
1411,KARI: Of course. Come on. 
1412,(Kari and Olvir leave.) 
1413,"NYSSA: It's crude stuff, probably organic. "
1414,DOCTOR: Think you can synthesise it? 
1415,NYSSA: I might even improve on it. 
1416,"SIGURD: Well, how's this supposed to free us from the Company? "
1417,NYSSA: Terminus Incorporated only control you because they supply you
1418,"with Hydromel, but if you produced your own "
1419,VALGARD: Here on Terminus. 
1420,SIGURD: Is it possible? 
1421,NYSSA: Of course. 
1422,SIGURD: But the Company would send troops. They'd destroy us. 
1423,"NYSSA: With the current reputation Lazar disease has, would any sane"
1424,soldier come here? 
1425,VALGARD: Of course they wouldn't. 
1426,SIGURD: I suppose not. 
1427,NYSSA: Then help. 
1428,SIGURD: All right. Why not? 
1429,"BOR: Oh, Sigurd. "
1430,(Nyssa gives Sigurd a phial of Hydromel.) 
1431,SIGURD: I'm with you. 
1432, [Terminus] 
1433, OLVIR: Are you sure these are the right cables? 
1434,KARI: According to the Doctor. 
1435,OLVIR: It's what you said about this ship. I'd hate to end the universe
1436,by mistake. 
1437,KARI: Give me the gun. 
1438,"OLVIR: No, no, I'll, I'll do it. Just wanted to be certain. "
1439,(Kari stands behind Olvir as he zaps the cables on the wall. The engine
1440,goes dark.) 
1441, [Vanir's room] 
1442, (Eirak enters with other Vanir.) 
1443,EIRAK: I want it found. Without the signal box we've got no control
1444,over the Garm. 
1445,(Then he sees Valgard.) 
1446,VALGARD: Pleased to see me? I want you to meet some people. 
1447,"DOCTOR: How do you do? I'm the Doctor, and this is Nyssa. "
1448,"EIRAK: All right, Valgard, what do you think you're doing? "
1449,VALGARD: I think you owe me something. 
1450,(Sigurd and Bor stand beside him.) 
1451,SIGURD: A small matter of your position here. 
1452,"VALGARD: If I bring back the intruders, your position is mine,"
1453,remember? There he is. 
1454,BOR: We all think it's time for a little chat. 
1455,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, before you start, perhaps one of you could show us"
1456,the way to the damaged engine. There's still a great deal to be done. 
1457, [Terminus] 
1458, (Kari looks at the bundle of severed wires.) 
1459,KARI: Terminus will never move again. 
1460,OLVIR: Have you given any thought as to how we're going to get home? 
1461,KARI: I'm about to. 
1462,"(Meanwhile, Valgard is escorting the Doctor and Nyssa.) "
1463,DOCTOR: It'll be good to see the Tardis again. 
1464,NYSSA: And Tegan. 
1465,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, it'll be nice to know she's safe. Tegan! "
1466,TEGAN: Doctor. 
1467,DOCTOR: What are you doing? 
1468,TEGAN: I was trying to reach you. Turlough went back to the Tardis on
1469,his own. 
1470,DOCTOR: I told you not to follow me. 
1471,"NYSSA: Doctor, say you're pleased to see her. "
1472,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I'm pleased to see her but she shouldn't have"
1473,followed us. 
1474,TEGAN: You don't understand. 
1475,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, we'll talk about it later. Valgard? "
1476,TEGAN: Why does he never listen? 
1477,NYSSA: He has a great deal to do. 
1478,TEGAN: There always is. 
1479,"NYSSA: Tegan, I have to tell you something. "
1480,DOCTOR: Now it's important you inform the authorities about what's been
1481,going on here. Make it impossible for Terminus Incorporated to
1482,"retaliate. For example, you must make contact with the pick-up ship. "
1483,VALGARD: What ship? 
1484,"DOCTOR: The one that takes the cured Lazars away. Well, the Garm will"
1485,know all about it. 
1486,VALGARD: We no longer have any control over him. 
1487,"DOCTOR: Then speak to him, win his confidence. You'll find him very"
1488,agreeable. 
1489,"TEGAN: Doctor? Doctor, talk to Nyssa. "
1490,DOCTOR: What is it? 
1491,NYSSA: I'm not coming with you. 
1492,DOCTOR: What? 
1493,NYSSA: There's too much to be done here. 
1494,TEGAN: Tell her she must. 
1495,"DOCTOR: Well, you can't stay. It isn't safe. Certainly not until the"
1496,Vanir have sorted out how they're to run Terminus. 
1497,"NYSSA: And with my skills, I can help them. "
1498,"TEGAN: We need you, too. "
1499,"NYSSA: I've enjoyed every moment of my time on the Tardis, and I'll"
1500,"miss you both, but here I have a chance to put into practice the skills"
1501,I learnt on Traken. 
1502,"TEGAN: Please, Nyssa. "
1503,"NYSSA: I'm adamant. Please, let us part in good faith. "
1504,DOCTOR: You do fully understand the commitment you'll be undertaking? 
1505,NYSSA: Yes. 
1506,DOCTOR: And that life here will be very hard. 
1507,"NYSSA: I am fully aware of that, but I want to stay. "
1508,DOCTOR: Then you're a very brave person. I wish you every luck. 
1509,(Nyssa kisses the Doctor on the cheek.) 
1510,TEGAN: She'll die here. 
1511,"NYSSA: Not easily, Tegan. Like you, I'm indestructible. "
1512,"(The girls hug, tearfully.) "
1513, [Tardis] 
1514, (Turlough is lying on the floor of the console
1515,room.) 
1516,GUARDIAN [on scanner]: Turlough. Can you hear me? 
1517,TURLOUGH: What? 
1518,GUARDIAN [on scanner]: The Doctor is returning. 
1519,TURLOUGH: I feel ill. 
1520,(He does look pale and sweaty.) 
1521,"GUARDIAN [on scanner]: This is your last chance, boy. "
1522,TURLOUGH: What did you do to me? 
1523,GUARDIAN [on scanner]: You will recover. 
1524,"TURLOUGH: I can't go on. Kill the Doctor yourself. Blame me for it, I"
1525,don't care. I can't do it. 
1526,GUARDIAN [on scanner]: You have little choice. 
1527,DOCTOR : Turlough? Turlough! 
1528,"GUARDIAN [on scanner]: He's coming, boy. This is your last chance. I"
1529,shall not say that again. Kill the Doctor!
