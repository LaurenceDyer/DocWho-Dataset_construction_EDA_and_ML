22,
23," (On the big wall screen, a man in a ribbed space"
24,suit is making fine adjustments to the path of a space capsule. His
25,control unit is labelled Van Lyden.) 
26,TALTALIAN : (French) And one degree. How are you reading? 
27,VAN LYDEN [on screen]: I'm reading okay. One degree. Now. Manoeuvre
28,completed. 
29,"CORNISH: You overshot, Charlie. Make a two second correction to port. "
30,(It's  Ronald
31,"Allen, again.) "
32,VAN LYDEN [on screen]: Two second correction to port. Now. Error
33,rectified. 
34,"CORNISH: You're doing fine, Charlie. "
35,VAN LYDEN [on screen]: What is my distance from Mars Probe 7? 
36,"CORNISH: Distance computation, please. "
37,"TALTALIAN : Distance five eight zero miles. Seven minutes, three"
38,seconds to objective. 
39,VAN LYDEN [on screen]: Confirmed. 
40,"CORNISH: Charlie, how's it going? "
41,VAN LYDEN [on screen]: No problem. Everything's fine. No contact yet? 
42,CORNISH: There's been no contact for seven months. 
43,VAN LYDEN [on screen]: How do we know they're still alive? 
44,CORNISH: They took off from Mars manually. They must have been alive
45,then. 
46,VAN LYDEN [on screen]: Something took off from Mars. 
47,TALTALIAN: (bushy beard) How is it going? 
48,CORNISH: They're closing. Charlie's a bit edgy. 
49,TALTALIAN: Can you blame him? It is possible he has gone up to a
50,rendezvous with a flying coffin. 
51,BRIGADIER: Do you think they're dead? 
52,"CORNISH: In seven months space time, they could have fixed a defective"
53,radio. 
54,"TALTALIAN: If they are dead, it is going to turn public opinion against"
55,our space programme. 
56,"CORNISH: Frightened your computer grant might be cut, Bruno? "
57,BRIGADIER: What are you going to tell the public? 
58,CORNISH: That's not my job.

60, [Space Control communications room]
61,
62,(A man in a smart dark suit is sitting in a glass
63,"fronted room behind Cornish's desk, with a clear view of Van Lyden on"
64,the big screen at the front of the main control room. He speaks to the
65,camera.) 
66,WAKEFIELD: In a few minutes we shall know the answer to the question
67,that has been occupying the minds of everyone here at Space Control
68,since Mars Probe 7 took off on its return journey from the red planet
69,nearly eight months ago. What has happened to astronauts Frank Michaels
70,and Joe Lefee? Communications remained perfect on the long outward
71,journey to the red planet and throughout the difficult landing. For a
72,full twelve hours they sent back pictures and reports from the surface
73,"of Mars. Both then seemed in perfect health, then silence."
74,
75, [UNIT Laboratory]
76,
77, WAKEFIELD [on tv screen]: The world assumed that
78,"disaster had overtaken the mission. But when all hope was gone, radio"
79,astronomers at Cambridge reported that Mars Probe 7 had blasted off and
80,was heading back to Earth. 
81,(The Doctor turns the sound down and walks back to the Tardis console
82,which has pride of place in his lab. He makes a few adjustments.) 
83,LIZ: What are you doing? 
84,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm trying to reactivate the Tardis' Time Vector"
85,Generator. 
86,LIZ: What's that supposed to do? 
87,"DOCTOR: Well, it could sent you into the future, if it starts working"
88,again. Particularly if you're standing there. 
89,"LIZ: Come on now, Doctor. "
90,(Liz dematerialises.) 
91,DOCTOR: Liz! Good grief! 
92,(He adjusts a control and dematerialises. Liz reappears.) 
93,LIZ: Doctor? Where are you? Doctor? 
94,(Liz dematerialises again and the Doctor appears. Another adjustment
95,and Liz returns.) 
96,"DOCTOR: Oh, there you are. "
97,LIZ: What happened? 
98,"DOCTOR: Well, we both got caught in the time warp field and were"
99,projected into the future. 
100,LIZ: Into the future? 
101,"DOCTOR: Yes, but only about fifteen seconds. "
102,LIZ: But I haven't been anywhere. You vanished. 
103,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. You vanished first. I only seemed to have vanished"
104,because you went into the future and I wasn't there yet. 
105,LIZ: Yes. 
106,DOCTOR: Yes. 
107,(The Doctor flicks a switch and Liz grabs the console.) 
108,"DOCTOR: Oh. Wretched thing seems to have packed up again. Still, we're"
109,on the right lines. 
110,"LIZ: Doctor, I still don't understand. "
111,DOCTOR: Look. 
112,(The Doctor notices something on the television.) 
113,DOCTOR: Good gracious. Lethbridge Stewart. What on Earth's he doing at
114,Space Control? 
115,"LIZ: Well, something's happened to the Mars Probe. "
116,"DOCTOR: Oh, and the Brigadier thinks it's his business. Oh well, I"
117,suppose he's got to do something to occupy his mind now that he's blown
118,up the Silurians. 
119,(Liz turns up the volume.) 
120,"WAKEFIELD : You can see from the radar screen, that's the screen"
121,"just to the left of Professor Cornish there, that the recovery capsule"
122,and Mars Probe 7 are on convergence. This is a tricky moment for
123,controller Ralph Cornish and his team. 
124,WAKEFIELD [on screen]: The two craft will be linking up in a moment or
125,two. 
126, [Space Control communications room]
127,
128, WAKEFIELD: And then we shall know the answer to
129,the mystery that has baffled the world's scientists for seven months.
130,
131,[Space Control]
132,
133," CORNISH: Charlie, do you have visual contact with"
134,the capsule yet? 
135,VAN LYDEN [on screen]: Not yet. I'm changing attitude of capsule. 
136,(The picture moves so Van Lyden is now upside down. What rot.) 
137,VAN LYDEN [on screen]: I can see it. I'm up alongside. 
138,"CORNISH: Well done, Charlie. Everything looks good. "
139,BRIGADIER: Ask him if it's definitely Mars Probe 7. 
140,CORNISH: What? 
141,BRIGADIER: Ask him. 
142,"CORNISH: Charlie, can you give us definite identification? It is Mars"
143,Probe 7. 
144,VAN LYDEN [on screen]: No doubt about it. I can see the markings. 
145,CORNISH: Fine. Do you hear anything from them? 
146,VAN LYDEN [on screen]: Still nothing. 
147,CORNISH: Try to contact once more before link up. 
148,VAN LYDEN [on screen]: Okay. 
149,CORNISH: Maybe their transmitter's too weak to reach us down
150,here. 
151,VAN LYDEN [on screen]: Recovery 7 to Mars Probe. Do you read me? I'm
152,"about to initiate link up. Do you read me? Nothing, Ralph. I'm going to"
153,"rotate for link up now. CORNISH: All right, Charlie. Go ahead."
154,
155, [Recovery 7]
156,
157, (The two capsules are of similar size.) 
158,VAN LYDEN: Buffeting slightly. Firing port retro jets to compensate.
159,Moving in for link up now. 
160,(Recovery 7 puts its slightly larger nose cone over Mars Probe.) 
161,VAN LYDEN: I have link up. 
162,"CORNISH : Well done, Charlie. Everything looks fine. "
163,VAN LYDEN: Activating locking clamps now.
164,
165, [UNIT Laboratory]
166,
167," WAKEFIELD : Well, as you've just heard, Van"
168,Lyden has succeeded in achieving link up. A beautifully smooth 
169,(Liz hands the Doctor a mug.) 
170,LIZ: I thought you weren't interested? 
171,WAKEFIELD : Operation in rather difficult circumstances. 
172,DOCTOR: They've just linked up. 
173,LIZ: Anything from the Mars Probe? 
174,WAKEFIELD : The capsules were buffeting slightly just 
175,"DOCTOR: No, not a sound. "
176,WAKEFIELD : However Van Lyden made it safely. 
177,(The Doctor gives Liz the mug.) 
178,LIZ: Thanks. 
179,WAKEFIELD : This must be a moment 
180, [Space Control]
181,
182," CORNISH: All right, Charlie, talk us through. "
183,VAN LYDEN : Injecting air into tunnel now.
184,
185, [Recovery 7]
186,
187, VAN LYDEN: Air injected into tunnel. 
188,CORNISH : Is air holding? 
189,VAN LYDEN: Air pressure in tunnel okay. Am moving to locking clamps. 
190,(Van Lyden floats down to the airlock.) 
191,VAN LYDEN: Releasing first clamp. First clamp away. Second clamp. I can
192,hear something.
193,
194, [Space Control]  
195,
196," CORNISH: What is it, Charlie? What do you hear?"
197,
198, [Recovery 7]
199,
200, VAN LYDEN: I think they're opening their hatch.
201,"Yes, it's them!"
202,
203, [Space Control]
204,
205, VAN LYDEN : Second clamp away.
206,
207, [Recovery 7]
208,
209, VAN LYDEN: Third clamp. Fourth. Opening hatch. 
210,"(Van Lyden starts to float through the hatch, then a noise makes his"
211,face contort in fear.)
212,
213, [Space Control]
214,
215, (The noise comes down the comms and everyone
216,covers their ears. Then it suddenly stops.) 
217,"CORNISH: Charlie, what's happened? Control to Recovery 7, do you read"
218,"me? (nothing) Control to Recovery 7, do you read me?"
219,
220, [UNIT Laboratory]
221,
222," LIZ: Doctor, what's the matter? What is it? "
223,DOCTOR: That sound. I've heard it somewhere before. 
224,LIZ: When? 
225,DOCTOR: That's just it. I can't remember! 
226,"LIZ: What do you mean, can't remember? "
227,DOCTOR: Don't you understand? It's all up here in my mind. The
228,"information's here, but I can't reach it. We'd better go there. "
229,LIZ: Where? 
230,DOCTOR: The Space Centre. It's not far.
231,
232, [Space Control]
233,
234," CORNISH: Control to Recovery 7, do you read me? "
235,RUTHERFORD: (woman) They've run a complete check on all our circuits.
236,There's no trouble this end. 
237,BRIGADIER: Can you send up another recovery capsule to investigate? 
238,"CORNISH: Not immediately. Control to Recovery 7, do you read me?"
239,
240, [Space Control communications room]
241,
242," WAKEFIELD: Doctor Taltalian, do you have any"
243,explanation for that sound we just heard? 
244,"TALTALIAN: At the moment, no. There is a possibility that it was some"
245,kind of static. 
246,WAKEFIELD: Have you ever heard static like that before? 
247,"TALTALIAN: In space research, one is constantly encountering new and"
248,unexpected factors. 
249,WAKEFIELD: But will you confirm that all radio contact has been lost
250,with the recovery capsule? 
251,"TALTALIAN: For the time being, yes, but temporary loss of communication"
252,"is not unusual. For instance, when the capsules go behind the moon "
253,WAKEFIELD: But those two capsules are not behind the moon. 
254,TALTALIAN: You can rest assured that everything possible is being done.
255,"Now, if you will excuse me. "
256,(Taltalian leaves.) 
257,"WAKEFIELD: Well, as you see, there appears to be no apparent"
258,explanation for the sudden breakdown in communication and until the
259,"situation becomes clearer, the world must wait and hope. "
260, [Space Control] 
261, (Two cars drive into the tunnel that is the
262,"entrance to Space Control, which is inside a rock face, rather like a"
263,"British NORAD or StarGate Command, but is actually the old cement works"
264,"near Northfleet, Kent.) "
265,"CORNISH: Control to Recovery 7, do you read me? "
266,BRIGADIER: Are they still holding the same position? 
267,"RUTHERFORD: Yes, they've kept on orbit. "
268,BRIGADIER: Have you any idea what might have happened to Recovery 7? 
269,"CORNISH: Control to Recovery 7, do you read me? "
270,RUTHERFORD: It could have been an excess of electricity in the Mars
271,Probe solar batteries. If Lefee and Michaels died on take off from
272,"Mars, there'd be no one to control the power build up in the solar"
273,batteries. 
274,BRIGADIER: And that would've affected Recovery on link up? 
275,RUTHERFORD: When the capsules were joined the electric circuits linked
276,automatically. Excess electricity in one could have blown all the
277,circuits of the other. 
278,"CORNISH: Control to Recovery 7, do you read me? "
279,BRIGADIER: Would that have killed the man in the Recovery capsule? 
280,RUTHERFORD: Not necessarily. He might still be able to unlink and bring
281,"himself back, but without communications. "
282,(A lift platform rises to the top of the stairs down into the control
283,room proper. It's the Doctor and Liz. The Doctor shouts back down the
284,shaft.) 
285,"DOCTOR: My dear fellow, I simply don't happen to have a pass! Because I"
286,"don't believe in them, that's why. "
287,(Two soldiers try to take the Doctor's arms.) 
288,"DOCTOR: Take your hands off me, sir. Ah, there you are. "
289,BRIGADIER: It's all right. I can vouch for these people. 
290,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, what are you doing here? "
291,DOCTOR: That sound. Have you heard it again? 
292,BRIGADIER: No. 
293,DOCTOR: You will. 
294,LIZ: He says it's some kind of a message. 
295,"BRIGADIER: Well, who from? "
296,DOCTOR: Have you got a recording of that message? 
297,CORNISH: I've no time to talk to the Press. 
298,"DOCTOR: Quite right. Neither have I. Now, that sound, have you got a"
299,recording of it? 
300,CORNISH: Everything here is recorded. 
301,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, everyone here's got a great deal to do. "
302,"DOCTOR: No, they haven't. There's nothing anybody can do for the time"
303,being. 
304,"CORNISH: Brigadier, who is this? "
305,BRIGADIER: He's one of my associates. 
306,CORNISH: Will you kindly get one of your associates out of here? 
307,"BRIGADIER: Come along, Doctor. "
308,"DOCTOR: Now you listen to me. That sound was some kind of a message,"
309,and it's going to be repeated. 
310,CORNISH: Will you please get this man out of here? We're trying to save
311,the lives of three astronauts. 
312,"DOCTOR: Nonsense, man. You're doing nothing of the sort. There's"
313,nothing you can possibly do 
314,(The noise starts up again. Everyone else covers their ears but the
315,Doctor concentrates hard for as long as it lasts.) 
316,"DOCTOR: High frequency accelerated impulses. Now then, I shall need"
317,"multi copies of that recording, unlimited computer time and somewhere"
318,"to work. Miss Shaw, I shall need your help. "
319,CORNISH: How did you know that sound was going to be repeated? 
320,"DOCTOR: By exercising my intelligence. Now, since we didn't reply, the"
321,"message would obviously be repeated. Now, we've got to break down that"
322,code and answer them. 
323,CORNISH: Answer who? 
324,DOCTOR: The man's a fool! How can I possibly tell who the message is
325,from until I know what it says? Let me explain this to you in very
326,simple terms. 
327,"BRIGADIER: He is trying to help, you know. You might find him quite"
328,useful. 
329,DOCTOR: Might find me useful? 
330,(The Brigadier takes the Doctor aside.) 
331,BRIGADIER: I mean that you could help Professor Cornish. He is in
332,charge here. 
333,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, of course. Look, my dear fellow, do please forgive"
334,"this intrusion, but you really must let me decode those messages. It"
335,could prove of vital importance to the safety of your astronauts. 
336,CORNISH: I suppose we must try everything. But how you can be so sure 
337,(Another noise blasts through the room briefly.) 
338,CORNISH: It seems you're right. I'll see about that computer. 
339,"DOCTOR: No, not now. "
340,"CORNISH: Do you want to crack the code, send a reply? "
341,"DOCTOR: That was the reply. Brigadier, I shall need worldwide"
342,triangulation immediately. 
343,BRIGADIER: But we know where the transmissions were coming from. The
344,capsule in orbit. 
345,"DOCTOR: The first ones, yes, but not that last one. That was completely"
346,different. Now we've got to find out where that was coming from. 
347,BRIGADIER: I'll get on to it. 
348,CORNISH: But aren't we too late now? 
349,DOCTOR: The message was repeated. Perhaps the reply will be. All we can
350,do now is wait. 
351,WAKEFIELD : The mystery of Mars Probe 7 has deepened. Seven and a
352,half months of total silence and now these strange transmissions for
353,which scientists here have no explanation.
354,
355, [Space Control communications room]
356,
357, WAKEFIELD: One theory is that it may be some kind
358,of distress signal. As it is now some hours since the last signal from
359,"the capsules, it's difficult to see what can be done short of sending"
360,up another recovery craft.
361,
362, [Space Control] 
363," (On an upper walkway, the Brigadier is putting"
364,pins in a map of the world.) 
365,BRIGADIER: That's Haystack. 
366,DOCTOR: And Algonquin. 
367,BRIGADIER: Algonquin. 
368,DOCTOR: Arecibo. 
369,BRIGADIER: Arecibo. 
370,DOCTOR: Cambridge. 
371,BRIGADIER: Cambridge. 
372,TALTALIAN: I have computerised the factors involved in sending up a
373,second recovery capsule. 
374,CORNISH: What's the minimum time for blast off? 
375,TALTALIAN: Ten days. 
376,CORNISH: That's impossible. 
377,BRIGADIER: Vorograd. 
378,LIZ: Tokyo's just promised full cooperation. 
379,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's good. "
380,"BRIGADIER: Tokyo. Right, that about covers the lot. "
381,"DOCTOR: Well, if it's from Earth, this could give us the country, but"
382,that's not accurate enough. We must pinpoint the exact location. 
383,"BRIGADIER: Well, we've got every national radio service standing by"
384,"with monitors. Wherever that signal's coming from, we'll find it. "
385,TALTALIAN: Recovery 8 was not scheduled for lift off until three months
386,from now. 
387,CORNISH: They'll have to speed it up. 
388,TALTALIAN: You know they've got problems with the new fuel injection
389,system. 
390,"(The noise comes again, and radio telescopes start their search. Liz"
391,gets a report on a nearby phone.) 
392,LIZ: From where? Nancy? Oui. 
393,DOCTOR: Something coming through. 
394,LIZ: Oui. Merci. From France. 
395,BRIGADIER: Right. 
396,(The Brigadier marks a location and presses a button. Three lines on
397,the map cross at one point.) 
398,DOCTOR: Yes. London. 
399,CORNISH: Can't the Americans do anything? 
400,TALTALIAN: I have checked. There is no capsule in go condition
401,anywhere. 
402,(The Doctor changes the wall map electronically but all he gets are the
403,stars and the Moon.) 
404,DOCTOR: Can I get a map of London on this thing? 
405,CORNISH: A what? 
406,DOCTOR: A map of London. It's very important. 
407,CORNISH: That machine will give you surface maps of every surveyed
408,"planet, but a map of London? No. "
409,DOCTOR: Useless gadgets. 
410,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, never mind the map. (into phone) Yes. Yes, fine."
411,"Yes, thank you. Goodbye. My people have just done a local"
412,triangulation. 
413,DOCTOR: What's the exact location? 
414,BRIGADIER: An abandoned warehouse seven miles from here.

416, [Warehouse office]
417,
418," (Broken windows, paper blowing in the wind, two"
419,men with sophisticated communications apparatus.) 
420,CARRINGTON: Run the message again. All the power you've got this time. 
421,(Played by the prolific John
422,"Abineri, smartly dressed and with an ornate buttonhole. ) "
423,"GREY: Full power, sir. "
424,CARRINGTON: Have to risk it. 
425,"GREY: Right, sir."
426,
427, [Warehouse yard]
428,
429, (Three UNIT Land Rovers arrive.) 
430,BRIGADIER: Out! A Section here. B section there. C section there! 
431, [Warehouse office]
432,
433, CARRINGTON: That's enough. 
434,"GREY: Do you think anyone's monitoring us, sir? "
435,CARRINGTON: There's sure to be. Finding us is another matter. 
436,(A man in a raincoat enters.) 
437,"COLLINSON: Sir, UNIT's outside. "
438,CARRINGTON: That's very efficient of them. Keep them off as long as you
439,can. 
440,"COLLINSON: Yes, sir. "
441,CARRINGTON: Don't kill anyone unless absolutely necessary.
442,
443, [Warehouse]
444,
445," (Collinson and his men take up positions, and"
446,start firing as the Brigadier leads his men towards them.) 
447,BRIGADIER: Take cover!
448,
449, [Warehouse office]
450,
451, CARRINGTON: Send the final transmission. 
452,"GREY: Have we time, sir? "
453,CARRINGTON: The sergeant will hold them off. 
454,"GREY: Right, sir. "
455, [Warehouse]
456,
457, (Collinson shoots a soldier and the gunfight
458,starts in earnest. A soldier breaks cover and gets shot. Another gets
459,his rifle shot out of his hand. Collinson leads a group from their
460,hiding place and the Brigadier leads some of his men out too.) 
461,BRIGADIER: Follow! 
462,(The Brigadier finally gets his eye in and shoots a couple of men. The
463,fighting starts to go hand to hand.) 
464,BRIGADIER: You can stop right there! 
465,(Collinson turns. Both men have their pistols aimed at the other.) 
466,BRIGADIER: Better put it down. 
467,COLLINSON: You're probably right. 
468,"BRIGADIER: You kill me, my men kill you. Pointless really. "
469,"(Behind Collinson, a UNIT soldier gets up and goes to a weight hanging"
470,from a chain.) 
471,COLLINSON: Since you put it like that. 
472,BRIGADIER: Right. Now! 
473,(Collinson dodges the swinging weight and knocks the gun out of the
474,"Brigadier's hand as he makes for the staircase. Near the top he turns,"
475,then drops his gun and walks down again with his hands up in
476,surrender.) 
477,"BRIGADIER: Right, take him."
478,
479, [Warehouse office]
480,
481, CARRINGTON: Trigger the self-destructor. 
482,"GREY: Right, sir. "
483,CARRINGTON: Out you go. 
484,"GREY: Yes, sir. "
485,(Grey starts to climb out of the window.)

487,CARRINGTON: Coming. 
488,"BRIGADIER : All right, open up! "

495," DOCTOR: Look, if I'm to help you people, I need"
496,full cooperation. 
497,CORNISH: What's the trouble? 
498,DOCTOR: I specified the need for computer time. If I'm to decode those
499,"messages, I need a computer. "
500,CORNISH: Go and see Doctor Taltalian. That's his department. 
501,"DOCTOR: Yes, so he's just informed me. But he's being totally"
502,non-cooperative. 
503,CORNISH: I'll talk to him. 
504,(A flat screen rises out of the desk.) 
505,CORNISH: I told you to give the Doctor full cooperation. See that he
506,gets it. 
507,"TALTALIAN [on screen]: Yes, of course I will. "
508,"CORNISH: Satisfied? Now, if you'll excuse me? "
509,DOCTOR: Yes. 
510,(The Doctor walks away.) 
511,RUTHERFORD: Houston have just called in. They can't raise them either. 
512,"CORNISH: Well, that's the least of our worries now. Athens have"
513,reported a solar flare build-up. A big one. 
514,"RUTHERFORD: Well, when do they expect it? "
515,CORNISH: Anytime within the next twenty four hours. 
516,RUTHERFORD: But they'll never survive solar flare radiation. You'll
517,have to bring them down on remote control. 
518,CORNISH: They're locked on manual. There's nothing we can do. Space
519,"control to Recovery 7, do you read me? Space Control to Recovery 7, do"
520,you read me? Athens has reported a dangerous solar flare build-up. It
521,is imperative you unlock manual control so that we can bring you down.
522,
523, [Recovery 7]
524,
525, CORNISH : I repeat. We have a message from
526,Athens Observatory. There is a massive solar flare building up. The

546, TALTALIAN: I want that tape. 
547,DOCTOR: Do you realise the importance of it? 
548,"TALTALIAN: Rather more than you, Doctor. "
549,"DOCTOR: So, you understood the message. "
550,TALTALIAN: Hand it over. 
551,DOCTOR: What are you going to do with it? 
552,"TALTALIAN: Doctor, give me that tape. "
553,"DOCTOR: Since you insist. (The Doctor holds out the reel, which"
554,disappears just before Taltalian can take it.) 
555,TALTALIAN: This is no time for conjuring tricks. Put up your hands. Up!
556,
557,(Taltalian searches the Doctor.) 
558,TALTALIAN: Where is that tape? 
559,LIZ: Perhaps he sent it into the future. 
560,"TALTALIAN: Doctor, are you trying to force me to shoot you? "
561,(The Brigadier enters.) 
562,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, I think you "
563,"DOCTOR: Careful, Brigadier. He's frightened. "
564,TALTALIAN: You. Come over here. Come here! 
565,(Liz walks to Taltalian and he uses her as a shield.) 
566,"LIZ: No, stop, you're hurting "
567,TALTALIAN: Be quiet! Don't try to follow me. 
568,"(Taltalian backs through the doorway, pushes Liz into the room and"
569,closes the door.) 
570,BRIGADIER: I'll go after him. 
571,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. "
572,BRIGADIER: Guards! 
573,DOCTOR: Are you all right? 
574,LIZ: I'm quite unhurt. Taltalian 
575,DOCTOR: I think we can safely leave him to the Brigadier. 
576,LIZ: What did you do with the tape? 
577,DOCTOR: What? 
578,LIZ: The tape! 
579,"DOCTOR: Oh, the tape. "
580,LIZ: Yes. 
581,"DOCTOR: Oh, here it is here. "
582,(The Doctor holds out his hand and the tape appears.) 
583,"LIZ: You didn't send it into the future, did you? "
584,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. No, that was simply transmigration of object."
585,"There's a great deal of difference between that and pure science, you"
586,"know. Now then, what about decoding this tape? Let me see now. "
587,LIZ: That'll be the analogue digital converter. 
588,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, that's just what I was looking for. "
589,LIZ: Let me. 
590,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. "
591,"(As Liz laces up the tape, the Brigadier enters.) "
592,BRIGADIER: He got away. This place is like a rabbit warren. I've set up
593,a search. 
594,"DOCTOR: Brigadier, what did you find at the warehouse? "
595,BRIGADIER: The transmitter. 
596,DOCTOR: And? 
597,BRIGADIER: We took several prisoners. One of them knows a great deal
598,more than he's saying. 
599,"DOCTOR: Well, I'd like to have a talk with him."

608,when you had the chance? 
609,"DOCTOR: Why don't you sit down, old chap? "
610,(Collinson sits at the table.) 
611,"DOCTOR: Now, you were under orders not to harm the Brigadier, weren't"
612,you? Who gave you those orders? 
613,COLLINSON: I can't answer any questions. 
614,DOCTOR: Anything found on him? 
615,BRIGADIER: No. His pockets were empty. 
616,DOCTOR: Clothes? 
617,"BRIGADIER: The sort of thing you can buy anywhere, but all the labels"
618,were cut out. 
619,"DOCTOR: You've been very thorough, haven't you. "
620,"BRIGADIER: You're in very serious trouble, you know. I can hold you"
621,here on security charges for a very long time. 
622,DOCTOR: Don't you realise that the men you are working with were
623,"seriously interfering with our space project, and thereby endangering"
624,the lives of three astronauts. 
625,"BRIGADIER: Look, I want answers from you, and I'm going to get them! "
626,"DOCTOR: Brigadier, you're wasting your time. "
627,BRIGADIER: This man knows something. 
628,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know, but he's not going to tell us and I think we've"
629,got more important things to do. 
630,BRIGADIER: All right. Corporal? 
631,(Champion opens the door and the Brigadier leaves. The Doctor turns
632,back on the threshold.) 
633,"DOCTOR: Looking after you all right, are they? Have you had a cup of"
634,tea? 
635,"COLLINSON: Yes, thanks. "
636,DOCTOR: That's good. Stand to attention when you're talking to me and
637,call me sir! 
638,(Collinson leaps to his feet.) 
639,COLLINSON: Sir! 
640,"DOCTOR: Just as I thought. Sergeant, aren't you? "
641,(The Brigadier re-enters.) 
642,BRIGADIER: A soldier. Are you a deserter? 
643,"DOCTOR: No, he's acting under orders. "

666,RUTHERFORD: It's started! 
667,CORNISH: Ten minutes too soon. What's he think he's doing? 
668,"DOCTOR: Well, that's it for now. I'd better go and see how Liz is"
669,getting on with the decoding. 
670,BRIGADIER: Don't you want to see what happens? 
671,"DOCTOR: No, no. No, if they're going to attempt a re-entry they must"
672,make at least one Earth's orbit. I'll be back in time for re-entry. Are
673,you coming? 
674,"BRIGADIER: No, I'll run a security trace on our prisoner. "

684, [Space Control computer room]
685,
686, DOCTOR: Yes. There's no pattern to it at all. It's
687,nonsense! 
688,DOBSON: Perhaps because we're feeding it nonsense. Maybe that sound
689,from the capsule was just freak static. 
690,DOCTOR: Yes. 
691,LIZ: I wonder. 
692,DOCTOR: Wonder what? 
693,LIZ: Maybe there's a computer malfunction. 
694,DOBSON: That's impossible. There's a self-checking mechanism. 
695,"LIZ: Well, even that could go wrong. I'll feed it a standard test"
696,programme. 
697,DOCTOR: Never mind all that. Ask it what two and two make. 
698,LIZ: What? 
699,"DOCTOR: Liz, ask it. "
700,"LIZ: Oh, all right. "
701,DOBSON: This is ridiculous. I checked that machine this morning. 
702,DOCTOR: How long have you known Doctor Taltalian? 
703,"DOBSON: Well, I've been his chief assistant for two years. I still"
704,can't believe all this. 
705,LIZ: It says two and two make five. 
706,"DOCTOR: Oh, it's typical. I never did trust those stupid things. "
707,"LIZ: No, no, this isn't just malfunction. Taltalian must have sabotaged"

780,CORNISH: It's impossible. Either the mechanisms jammed or 
781,DOCTOR: They've locked it from the inside? 
782,BRIGADIER: Then we'll have to cut it open. 
783,CORNISH: It's too dangerous for the astronauts.

802,and clear the away ahead of us. You bring up the rear. 
803,"(The low-loader crawls away. Bessie starts up, begins to turn around"
804,and stops again. She gets going again when the convoy is some way away.
805,A helicopter swoops low and drops smoke grenades in front of the

809,the weapon too. The lowloader is captured and driven away while a UNIT
810,soldier manages to get onto the helicopter and tries to force open the

812,disappearing in the distance. The men driving it are revealed to be
813,"Carrington and Grey. Meanwhile, Bessie is bumping down the road when"
814,the Doctor sees the lowloader coming towards him. He parks Bessie in
815,"the middle of the track, forcing them to stop. Grey totally fails to"

817,"GREY: Get out of the way, please. "
818,DOCTOR: I'm afraid I can't. 
819,"GREY: Will you please get out of the way, sir? We're carrying a very"
820,important cargo. 
821,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, if you want me to get out of the way, I'm afraid"

887,years.

949,"DOCTOR: Right, cut it open! "
950, Episode Three
951,
952, [Space Control hangar]
953,
954, (The capsule's door is cut away and Cornish looks
955,inside.) 
956,CORNISH: It's empty! 
957,DOCTOR: What? Let me see. 
958,CORNISH: But we were talking to Van Lyden. 
959,"DOCTOR: Liz, try them again. "
960,"LIZ: Hello, recovery 7. Do you read me? "
961,"VAN LYDEN : Hello, Space Control. This is Recovery 7. Will you"
962,clear us for re-entry? 
963,(The Doctor points at a tape machine whirring away.) 
964,"DOCTOR: Well, well, well. A tape recording. "
965,CORNISH: Triggered off by our speech. 
966,BRIGADIER: Then where are the astronauts? 
967,"DOCTOR: Well, someone wanted us to believe they were still inside"
968,"there. That tape recorder's not a standard part of their equipment, is"
969,it? 
970,"CORNISH: No, of course not. "
971,"DOCTOR: Then somebody put it there, didn't they? "
972,LIZ: Why? 
973,CORNISH: To delay us opening the capsule. 
974,LIZ: Why should they want to do that? 
975,"DOCTOR: Well, to gain time. Now, suppose the astronauts were still in"
976,"there when it landed, and later they were removed. "
977,"BRIGADIER: No, that's impossible. This capsule's been guarded all the"
978,"time, and you two were here. "
979,CORNISH: Except when your men turned us out for that security check. 
980,BRIGADIER: What? 
981,LIZ: They sent us back to the control room while they searched the
982,area. 
983,DOCTOR: I take it you didn't order this. 
984,"BRIGADIER: No, I didn't. "
985,"DOCTOR: Well, there you are then. A bogus patrol turns up, clears the"
986,"area, and removes the astronauts at their leisure. "
987,CORNISH: Who would want to kidnap three astronauts? 
988,"DOCTOR: Yes, perhaps the same people who replied to that message. "
989,BRIGADIER: I think I'll have a word with my guard commander. 
990,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'll come with you. "
991,LIZ: Doctor! 
992,DOCTOR: Yes? What is it? 
993,"LIZ: The Geiger counter, it's on maximum. The interior's radioactive."
994,"If anyone was in there, they're as good as dead."
995,
996, [Heldorf's laboratory]
997,
998, (Three fully suited and helmeted figures lie in an
999,observation area. Carrington is now in full military uniform.) 
1000,"HELDORF: (germanic) Two million rads. Scientifically, they should be"
1001,dead. 
1002,CARRINGTON: But they're not. 
1003,"HELDORF: When we tried to remove their helmets, they resisted"
1004,violently. 
1005,CARRINGTON: I told you not to remove their protective clothing. 
1006,"HELDORF: General Carrington, these men have received massive doses of"
1007,radiation. They need total blood transfusions immediately. They need
1008,"antibiotics, cortisone injections. You don't understand the situation."
1009,We must reduce the radiation 
1010,CARRINGTON: Just increase it! 
1011,HELDORF: Are you mad? That would be murder! 
1012,CARRINGTON: The radiation which affects these men is something totally
1013,"new to us. To survive it, they have become dependent on it. "
1014,HELDORF: What you're saying is contrary to everything that's understood
1015,about radioactivity. 
1016,"CARRINGTON: You must feed them radiation, otherwise they will die. "
1017,"HELDORF: No, no, no. You can't ask me to do that. "
1018,CARRINGTON: I am not asking you.
1019,
1020, [Quinlan's office]
1021,
1022, DOCTOR: I don't think you can sweep all this under
1023,"the Ministry carpet, Sir James. Someone in authority has done this. "
1024,"QUINLAN: The astronauts were in your charge, Brigadier. "
1025,BRIGADIER: They were taken from the Space Centre by two army officers. 
1026,QUINLAN: Obviously impostors. 
1027,BRIGADIER: The papers of authorisation were genuine. Their passes were
1028,made out in the names of two non-existent officers. They had a platoon
1029,and an army vehicle of the latest design. Not the sort of thing you buy
1030,from an army surplus store. 
1031,"QUINLAN: You've been very thorough, Brigadier. It's a pity you've no"
1032,explanation to offer for these strange occurrences. 
1033,"DOCTOR: We haven't come here to offer explanations, Sir James, we've"
1034,come to demand them. From you. 
1035,QUINLAN: All right. 
1036,DOCTOR: You mean you're going to tell us the truth? 
1037,QUINLAN: No. 
1038,DOCTOR: Oh. 
1039,QUINLAN: But I'm going to introduce you to the man who can. Will you
1040,come in please? 
1041,(Carrington enters.) 
1042,"QUINLAN: General Carrington, head of the newly formed Space Security"
1043,department. 
1044,LIZ: Space Security? Weren't you an astronaut on Mars Probe 6? 
1045,"CARRINGTON: Yes, I was. Please sit down, Brigadier. I realise I owe you"
1046,all an apology. I can only ask you to believe that everything I have
1047,done has been for the good of us all. 
1048,DOCTOR: Does that include sending coded messages to Mars Probe 7? And
1049,kidnapping three astronauts? 
1050,LIZ: And Doctor Bruno Taltalian holding a gun on us in the computer
1051,room? 
1052,CARRINGTON: Taltalian was under strict orders to make sure you didn't
1053,"have access to the computer. You see, every astronaut is issued with an"
1054,emergency code only to be used in the ultimate emergency. The code
1055,you've been trying to crack. The message we received from Mars Probe 7
1056,told us that the deep space capsule had passed through a hitherto
1057,unsuspected high density radiation belt on its way back to Earth orbit.
1058,
1059,LIZ: Why didn't you inform Space Control at once? 
1060,CARRINGTON: Security. 
1061,"BRIGADIER: Then why wasn't I informed, sir? "
1062,CARRINGTON: UNIT is an international organisation and the government
1063,wanted to keep this in its own hands. 
1064,"DOCTOR: Yes, but why all this extraordinary behaviour? Well, surely"
1065,radiation is a normal hazard of space travel? 
1066,CARRINGTON: We believe this radiation to be a different kind. We
1067,"believe it to be self-sustaining and highly contagious, and that it"
1068,"could spread like a plague, contaminating the entire planet. "
1069,QUINLAN: We don't want the public to become panic-stricken. 
1070,"DOCTOR: Well, it seems to have been a question of the right hand"
1071,"fighting the left, doesn't it, Brigadier? "
1072,"CARRINGTON: Good! Well, I hope this explanation has eased your minds,"
1073,gentlemen. 
1074,"DOCTOR: Well, it hasn't eased mine. "
1075,CARRINGTON: I'm sorry? 
1076,DOCTOR: I should like to take a look at these mysteriously irradiated
1077,"astronauts for myself, if I may. "
1078,CARRINGTON: There's no need for that. They're in expert hands. 
1079,"DOCTOR: Nevertheless, I would still like to see them. "
1080,"QUINLAN: Well, I don't see it can do any harm. "
1081,"CARRINGTON: Oh, very well then, I'll take you there now. But I can"
1082,assure you they're perfectly safe.
1083,
1084, [Heldorf's laboratory]
1085,
1086, (Heldorf and his assistant are being held at
1087,gunpoint. The astronauts are released from the isolation room.) 
1088,HELDORF: Who are you people? 
1089,REEGAN: I've told you before to be quiet. 
1090,HELDORF: Where are you going? Where are you taking them? 
1091,REEGAN: Shut up! 
1092,"HELDORF: But if you take them out of here, they will die. You must"
1093,stop! 
1094,REEGAN: I'll take them out to the others. You two go back by the direct
1095,route when you've finished here. 
1096,(Heldorf tries to leave and is punched in the stomach. He tries again
1097,and is shot. The assistant picks up a chair and also gets shot.)
1098,
1099, [Outside Heldorf's laboratory]
1100,
1101, (The astronauts get into the back of a truck.) 
1102,"REEGAN: You two ride with them. They won't hurt you. You've got guns,"
1103,haven't you? 
1104,(The two killers get in the back and Reegan drives the Heyhoe laundry
1105,"truck away. Shortly afterwards, the Doctor drives up with Carrington,"
1106,Liz and the Brigadier. Carrington opens the shed doors.)
1107,
1108, [Heldorf's laboratory]
1109,
1110," BRIGADIER: Do you know where the phone is, sir? "
1111,"CARRINGTON: Oh, yes. It's over there. "
1112,"BRIGADIER: Hello, UNIT control? This is the Brigadier. "
1113,"DOCTOR: Perfectly safe, were they? "
1114,BRIGADIER: (in background) This is a yellow alert. 
1115,CARRINGTON: I don't understand it. Who would have done this? 
1116,BRIGADIER: I want a full emergency team. 
1117,"LIZ: Doctor, look at this. "
1118,BRIGADIER: Map reference C341. 
1119,LIZ: These seem to be the radiation records of the missing astronauts.
1120,Over two million rads. They couldn't possibly have survived that
1121,amount. 
1122,(The laundry van drives into a gravel workings and parks up. Wearing a
1123,"radiation suit, Reegan pulls the bodies of his henchmen from the back"
1124,and puts them on the side of a gravel heap with papers and their
1125,weapons. Then he scrambles up the heap and forces gravel down to cover
1126,them. Reegan drives the van off and parks up on a country road. There
1127,"he changes the number plates at the touch of a button, and the signage"
1128,"on the van becomes Silcock Bakeries at the same time. Back at the lab,"
1129,a soldier walks through with a Geiger counter.) 
1130,"DOCTOR: Liz, what were those exact radiation figures again? "
1131,"LIZ: Two million, one oh two, four six two. "
1132,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
1133,CARRINGTON: Are you getting anywhere? 
1134,DOCTOR: Possibly. 
1135,CARRINGTON: Do you realise the importance of this 
1136,"DOCTOR: I realise the importance very well, General Carrington. That is"
1137,why I must be allowed to continue my work undisturbed. 
1138,CARRINGTON: I'm so sorry. 
1139,LIZ: These are the complete readings. 
1140,"DOCTOR: Oh, thanks. You know, it's the most extraordinary thing. Those"
1141,astronauts were emitting radiation like walking reactors. 
1142,LIZ: But radiation destroys human tissue. 
1143,DOCTOR: Yes. I know. 
1144,(The Brigadier enters.) 
1145,"BRIGADIER: The radioactive trace goes to just outside the building,"
1146,sir. Then it vanishes. 
1147,CARRINGTON: Obviously they were taken away in a vehicle. 
1148,BRIGADIER: Why should anyone kidnap them? 
1149,CARRINGTON: Contagious radiation could be a terrible weapon in the
1150,hands of a foreign power. 
1151,"BRIGADIER: Who else knew of the location of this laboratory, sir? "
1152,CARRINGTON: Only my immediate staff. 
1153,"BRIGADIER: And Sir James Quinlan, and his immediate staff. Well Doctor,"
1154,any luck? 
1155,"DOCTOR: Well, I can tell you where your three astronauts are. "
1156,CARRINGTON: Well? 
1157,DOCTOR: They're still in orbit. 
1158,CARRINGTON: But they came down in the capsule. They were here. I saw
1159,them. 
1160,"DOCTOR: No, you saw three spacesuits. I don't know what came down in"
1161,"Recovery 7, but it certainly wasn't human."
1162,
1163, [Underground laboratory]
1164,
1165, (The astronauts are back in an isolation chamber.)
1166,
1167,LENNOX: They must be dying. 
1168,REEGAN: I don't think so. 
1169,"LENNOX: Well, I can't deal with them here. They should be the intensive"
1170,care unit in a hospital. 
1171,"REEGAN: You've got your instructions, Lennox. "
1172,"LENNOX: Doctor Lennox, if you don't mind. "
1173,REEGAN: I thought they took that away from you. (into phone) Hello?
1174,"This is Reegan. Everything went fine. Lennox is looking after them. No,"
1175,no trouble at all. I just dropped those two off on the way. Right.
1176,
1177, [Space Control hangar]
1178,
1179, CORNISH: And you really think that they're still
1180,in orbit in the Mars Probe? 
1181,DOCTOR: I do. 
1182,CORNISH: Their life support systems will be running down. We've got to
1183,send up another recovery capsule. 
1184,"DOCTOR: I should do that as quickly as possible, if I were you. "
1185,CORNISH: I'll get onto Quinlan. 
1186,DOCTOR: Must you? 
1187,CORNISH: I'll need his authority. Get me Sir James Quinlan. Top
1188,priority.
1189,
1190, [Quinlan's office]
1191,
1192, QUINLAN: Yes? Yes. But we don't really know if the
1193,astronauts are up there.
1194,
1195, [Space Control hangar]
1196,
1197," CORNISH: Well, if there's any possibility they're"
1198,"alive up there, we've got to go and get them."
1199,
1200, [Quinlan's office]
1201,
1202," QUINLAN: Yes, of course, but the government simply"
1203,will not authorise the expenditure on so little evidence.
1204,
1205, [Space Control hangar]
1206,
1207, CORNISH: We're not talking about money. We're
1208,talking about human life.
1209,
1210, [Quinlan's office]
1211,
1212," QUINLAN: Well, yes, indeed, I"
1213,
1214, [Space Control hangar]
1215,
1216," CORNISH: Sir James, I'm going to start"
1217,"preparations now. Unless I get your full backing, I'll call a press"
1218,conference and tell them the entire story.
1219,
1220, [Quinlan's office]
1221,
1222, QUINLAN: I would advise you not to do that.
1223,
1224, [Space Control hangar]
1225,
1226, CORNISH: Then you'll have to make sure that I
1227,don't have to.
1228,
1229, [Quinlan's office]
1230,
1231, QUINLAN: What are we going to do? 
1232,CARRINGTON: They mustn't send up a second recovery capsule. 
1233,"QUINLAN: I know that, but how are we going to stop them?"
1234,
1235, [Underground laboratory]
1236,
1237, (One of the astronauts goes to the observation
1238,room window then slides to the floor. Reegan enters as Lennox goes to
1239,the door.) 
1240,REEGAN: And just what do you think you're doing? 
1241,LENNOX: You've got to let me examine those men. 
1242,REEGAN: It's against orders. 
1243,LENNOX: The radiation count has dropped drastically. They should be
1244,recovering. 
1245,"REEGAN: That's good, then. "
1246,LENNOX: But one of them's collapsed! 
1247,"REEGAN: Well, I was hired to get them here, that's all. "
1248,LENNOX: You weren't hired to let them die. 
1249,REEGAN: We don't know they're dying. 
1250,"LENNOX: Reegan, do you think you'll get your money if they're dead? "
1251,(Reegan unlocks the isolation room door.) 
1252,"LENNOX: Well, what about protective clothes? "
1253,"REEGAN: You said the radiation had dropped. Right, I won't hang about"
1254,in there. 
1255,(Reegan puts on a pair of protective gloves and goes through the little
1256,airlock into the isolation chamber. He helps the collapsed astronaut
1257,back onto the slab with the other two but it suddenly pushes him aside
1258,and knocks him down. The astronaut enters the lab.) 
1259,LENNOX: It's all right. I want to help you. Can't you understand? I
1260,want to help you. 
1261,(Lennox runs up the stairs and it follows him. The outside door is
1262,locked.) 
1263,LENNOX: No! No! 
1264,"(The astronaut stretches its hand towards Lennox's face, then slowly"
1265,crumples to the floor. Reegan runs up.) 
1266,LENNOX: You shouldn't have locked this door. I might have been killed. 
1267,REEGAN: Shut up. Help me get him back in there. 
1268,(The phone rings.) 
1269,"REEGAN: Hello. All right, I'll take care of them. Listen, about those"
1270,"astronauts. Isotopes? Well, you'd better get them over here."
1271,I found out what's wrong with these fellows. They don't need less
1272,"radiation, they need more! "
1273,"(The bodies are discovered at the gravel workings. In the lab, isotopes"
1274,have been delivered and are being placed in the isolation room.)
1275,
1276, [Space Control hangar]
1277,
1278, CORNISH: (into phone.) I must have all stages in
1279,"go condition as soon as possible, so get on with it! "
1280,BRIGADIER: Any trouble? 
1281,CORNISH: Everything's taking just that little bit longer than it
1282,should. 
1283,DOCTOR: And why do you think that is? 
1284,CORNISH: I think it's got something to do with Sir James Quinlan. 
1285,BRIGADIER: Could you prove it? 
1286,CORNISH: No.
1287,
1288, [Underground laboratory]
1289,
1290, LENNOX: I feel as if I've just murdered them. 
1291,REEGAN: You just keep doing what you're told. They'll be all right. 
1292,(A phone rings.) 
1293,REEGAN: Who is it? All right. I'll open the front door. 
1294,LENNOX: Look! 
1295,REEGAN: What is it? 
1296,LENNOX: It's working. 
1297,(The astronauts are moving.) 
1298,REEGAN: I told you they'd be all right. They thrive on the stuff.
1299,
1300, [Space Control hangar]
1301,
1302," BRIGADIER: (into phone.) What? Yes, I see. Right,"
1303,I'll get right down there. Two bodies have been found in a gravel pit
1304,in Hertfordshire. They died from radiation.
1305,
1306, [Underground laboratory]
1307,
1308," REEGAN: Hey, Lennox, you're a kind of a scientist."
1309,Do you know these two? 
1310,(Reegan hands Lennox photographs of Liz and the Doctor in the computer
1311,room.) 
1312,"LENNOX: Yes, I think I met the girl once. She was doing research at"
1313,Cambridge. Why? 
1314,REEGAN: Seems like they're getting in the way. I'll need to deal with
1315,them.
1316,
1317, [Space Control hangar]
1318,
1319, (The Doctor has swept the capsule for radiation.) 
1320,DOCTOR: It's the most extraordinary thing. The radioactive
1321,contamination has almost vanished. If you can't get Recovery 8 ready in
1322,"time, you can use this capsule. "
1323,CORNISH: Provided we can get the three thousand tons of rockets to go
1324,underneath it. 
1325,(A soldier hands a message to Liz.) 
1326,DOCTOR: Who's it from? 
1327,LIZ: The Brigadier. He wants us to go down to Hertfordshire to look at
1328,those bodies. 
1329,DOCTOR: How very morbid. 
1330,LIZ: Are you coming? 
1331,"DOCTOR: No, I'm going to stay and get this capsule fully operational. "
1332,"(So Liz gets to drive Bessie. Going through a village, another car"
1333,follows her.) 
1334,BRIGADIER: Doctor? 
1335,DOCTOR: You're back soon. 
1336,"BRIGADIER: Well, I started back an hour ago. "
1337,DOCTOR: But Liz has just gone to meet you. We received a message asking
1338,us to join you. You didn't send it? 
1339,BRIGADIER: I'll get after her. 
1340,"(Liz has realised she is being followed, and is trying to lose them."
1341,The two men force her to stop in a village but she runs across a
1342,playing field and across a weir - Marlow weir if you're interested. The
1343,"men catch her half way across. She pushes one away and he slips, just"
1344,clinging on above the water. Then Liz goes over the railing towards the
1345,rushing water.) 
1346, Episode Four
1347,
1348, [Weir] 
1349,(The first man scrambles up and helps the second to
1350,pull Liz back up onto the weir.) 
1351, [Underground laboratory]
1352,
1353," LIZ: Will you let go of my arm, you're hurting me."
1354,Ow! 
1355,(Liz is forced down the stairs.) 
1356,REEGAN: I've brought you some company. 
1357,LENNOX: I thought they told you to get both of them. 
1358,"REEGAN: Oh, he wouldn't keep the appointment. She's a scientist. She"
1359,can give you a hand. 
1360,LIZ: Doctor Lennox! 
1361,REEGAN: Somebody remembers you. How are our zombie friends? 
1362,"LENNOX: Surviving, but only just. "
1363,REEGAN: I didn't expect them to be dancing a jig. Start making yourself
1364,useful. 
1365,LIZ: What if I don't? 
1366,REEGAN: I might just lock you in there with them.
1367,
1368, [Brigadier's office]
1369,
1370, BRIGADIER: I've issued Miss Shaw's description to
1371,every police force in the country. 
1372,CARRINGTON: Why? Do you expect her to be wandering the streets? 
1373,"BRIGADIER: No, sir, just a formality. "
1374,CARRINGTON: I took the liberty of examining the things found on the
1375,bodies of those two men. 
1376,"BRIGADIER: They should have gone to Forensics, sir, untouched. "
1377,CARRINGTON: No need for that. Forensics can't tell us anything we can't
1378,see for ourselves. Look. Newspaper cutting in a foreign language. 
1379,"DOCTOR: Anyone can buy a foreign newspaper, General. "
1380,"CARRINGTON: What about this comb then, with the makers imprint on it in"
1381,the same language? 
1382,DOCTOR: Let me look. 
1383,(The Doctor uses a jeweler's eyeglass to read the tiny marks.) 
1384,"DOCTOR: Very remiss of them, keeping this. "
1385,"BRIGADIER: They could have been planted, sir. "
1386,CARRINGTON: No. The only people who could set up an organisation of
1387,this size would be foreign agents with enormous resources behind them. 
1388,DOCTOR: And hair combs. 
1389,CARRINGTON: They want to use the radiated astronauts as a weapon. 
1390,"DOCTOR: I've told you where your astronauts are, General. They're still"
1391,in orbit. 
1392,CARRINGTON: That's ridiculous. 
1393,"DOCTOR: Is it? When your Professor Heldorf had the aliens in his care,"
1394,he started to record some sort of radio communication impulses. 
1395,"CARRINGTON: Astronauts do have walkie-talkies in their helmets, you"
1396,know. 
1397,DOCTOR: Then why didn't Heldorf talk to them? 
1398,"CARRINGTON: Yes, well, perhaps he was recording the level of"
1399,radioactivity in their bodies. 
1400,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I don't think so. Well, I'm going down to the Space"
1401,"Centre, use the computer. I trust your man Taltalian won't hold a gun"
1402,on me this time? 
1403,"CARRINGTON: Doctor, nothing is to be gained by deciphering these"
1404,impulses. Our objective should be to find the missing astronauts. 
1405,"DOCTOR: General, how many times must I tell you, your astronauts are"
1406,still in orbit. My objective is to find out what these aliens are
1407,trying to say to us.

1411, CORNISH: What's the K factor? 
1412,TALTALIAN: Fuel one thousand two hundred ninety seven tons. 
1413,CORNISH: No other available source? 
1414,"TALTALIAN: Liquid fuel in production, two thousand tons. "
1415,"CORNISH: Well, that can be speeded up. "
1416,TALTALIAN: The new M3 variant's highly volatile. It was not intended
1417,for manned spaceflight. 
1418,CORNISH: We'll have to use it. 
1419,TALTALIAN: The lift-off rate would crush the astronaut. 
1420,CORNISH: What about reducing the Gs by mixing K and M3? 
1421,TALTALIAN: I will compute that. But you will still have to get your
1422,rocket built. 
1423,CORNISH: The minister is putting up every possible objection. 
1424,TALTALIAN: What do you expect? This Doctor's theory is ridiculous. 
1425,"CORNISH: I thought you were supposed to be helping me, or do you intend"
1426,to commit more sabotage? 
1427,TALTALIAN: I was ordered to do that by General Carrington. I have
1428,computed the assembly of the rescue rocket as you asked me. 
1429,(The Doctor quietly enters and sticks a pen into Taltalian's back.) 
1430,"DOCTOR: You're not armed, I hope? "
1431,"TALTALIAN: I would not have used that gun, not on a fellow scientist. "
1432,DOCTOR: Thank you. I'm much relieved. 
1433,(Taltalian sees the Doctor is only holding a pen.) 
1434,CORNISH: Have they found your assistant? 
1435,"DOCTOR: No, not yet. May I have the use of your computer? "
1436,"CORNISH: Yes, certainly, and I'm sure Doctor Taltalian will be only too"
1437,"pleased to help you. When you have a moment, I'd like to see you in the"
1438,control room about the Recovery Capsule. 
1439,(Cornish leaves.) 
1440,"DOCTOR: I'd like to programme these impulse records, if I may. "
1441,TALTALIAN: What do you hope to learn from them? 
1442,"DOCTOR: Well if I knew, I wouldn't need a computer, would I? "
1443,"TALTALIAN: To make a start, we must have some idea. "
1444,"DOCTOR: Well, I suspect some sort of pattern. "
1445,TALTALIAN: This could take a long time. 
1446,"DOCTOR: Well, it mustn't, Taltalian, it mustn't. "
1447,"TALTALIAN: Doctor, I am not trying to obstruct you. "
1448,(The phone rings.) 
1449,"TALTALIAN: Excuse me. Hello, Taltalian here. Yes? Who is that? A"
1450,"moment, please. It is for you. "
1451,"DOCTOR: Thank you. Hello? Yes? Yes, it is. Who is this? "
1452,(The other party rings off.) 
1453,"DOCTOR: My assistant, Liz Shaw. "
1454,TALTALIAN: They have found her? 
1455,DOCTOR: No. Someone threatening to kill her if I don't stop
1456,"interfering. Well, let's get back to work, shall we?"

1460, (Liz is working at a computer console.) 
1461,"LIZ: Two million rads, dropping to two million minus fifty thousand. "
1462,LENNOX: Minus five oh thousand. You'd better tell Reegan we've only got
1463,one more canister left. Well? Do you want them to die? 
1464,MASTERS: You'd better be right. 
1465,(The thug leaves. Liz puts on her coat and dashes up the stairs.) 
1466,LENNOX: It's no use. They lock it. 
1467,LIZ: Are you a prisoner? 
1468,LENNOX: That's a matter of opinion. 
1469,LIZ: Are you or aren't you? 
1470,LENNOX: I can come and go as I please. But I haven't got anywhere to
1471,go. 
1472,LIZ: You were a respected scientist once. 
1473,LENNOX: Grossly underpaid. Can you help me? 
1474,"(Lennox hands Liz the radiation suit gloves and helmet, then puts a"
1475,door key on the table.) 
1476,"LENNOX: I, I lost my key somewhere, for that door up there. They'll"
1477,"find me in the cubicle, locked and bolted from the outside. Do you"
1478,understand? 
1479,"LIZ: Yes, of course. Why don't you come with me? "
1480,LENNOX: Where would I go? 
1481,(Liz puts the radiation helmet on Lennox and takes the key. She opens
1482,the isolation chamber door and Lennox enters with an isotope canister.

1487, DOCTOR: These impulses are mathematical formulae
1488,for building an electronic device. 
1489,TALTALIAN: What sort of a electronic device? 
1490,"DOCTOR: I'll have to build it to find out, won't I? "
1491,TALTALIAN: In defiance of the message threatening Miss Shaw's life? 
1492,"DOCTOR: Well, how are these people going to know what I'm doing unless"
1493,somebody tells them? 
1494,TALTALIAN: Who would do that? 
1495,"DOCTOR: You, for instance? "
1496,(Liz comes out of a small blockhouse and runs through the woods.) 
1497,TALTALIAN: You are being most insulting! 
1498,DOCTOR: And you are being continually obstructive. 
1499,TALTALIAN: I acted under the orders of General Carrington. 
1500,DOCTOR: Did you? Or are you involved with the people who are really
1501,behind this? 
1502,TALTALIAN: What people are you talking about? 
1503,"DOCTOR: The people who kidnapped Miss Shaw, who kidnapped the three"
1504,astronauts. 
1505,TALTALIAN: Have you told the Brigadier about your suspicions? 
1506,"DOCTOR: No, not yet. "
1507,"TALTALIAN: Why not, if you are so sure of your facts? "
1508,"DOCTOR: Well, I thought I'd offer you some sort of alternative. A"
1509,"ruthless investigation by the Brigadier, or a few quiet words with me"
1510,and your name kept out of things. 
1511,TALTALIAN: I don't know what you are talking about. 
1512,"DOCTOR: I think you do, Taltalian, and I'm going to give you a little"
1513,"time to think it over. Right, well, if you'll excuse me, I must see"
1514,what can be done about building this machine. Think over what I've
1515,said. I shall expect to hear from you very soon. (The Doctor leaves.

1530,left open. 
1531,"REEGAN: You might have killed poor Lennox, locking him in with those"

1533,LIZ: He should have thought of that before he joined you. 
1534,REEGAN: Get over there and help him. 
1535,MASTERS: Come on. 
1536,"LIZ: Don't touch me, you. "
1537,REEGAN: And Will? Make sure that door is kept locked. Did you bring it?
1538,
1539,(Taltalian hands over the device and some papers.) 
1540,TALTALIAN: These are the operating instructions. This is the
1541,communication code. It's quite simple. 
1542,REEGAN: A little too simple. 
1543,TALTALIAN: What does that mean? 
1544,REEGAN: I need to talk to those things. 
1545,TALTALIAN: You have a list of simple signals and commands. Transmit and
1546,they will obey. 
1547,REEGAN: And if they don't? 
1548,TALTALIAN: You threaten to cut off their supply of radiation. There is
1549,"a signal for that, too. "
1550,REEGAN: And translating their replies? There's a machine for that? 
1551,"TALTALIAN: Yes, in my computer room. You don't need it. "
1552,REEGAN: I'm the one dealing with these creatures. 
1553,TALTALIAN: You will use these creatures to carry out a series of raids
1554,"on carefully chosen targets. You know enough to do your job, but I have"
1555,further instructions for you. 
1556,REEGAN: Have you now? 
1557,TALTALIAN: Your call to the Doctor threatening the girl's life was
1558,stupid. 
1559,REEGAN: It might have slowed him down a little. 
1560,"TALTALIAN: On the contrary, it merely made him more determined and"
1561,suspicious. Suspicious of me. 
1562,REEGAN: Too bad. 
1563,TALTALIAN: He has got to be put out of the way permanently. 
1564,REEGAN: To save your neck? 
1565,TALTALIAN: He is about to discover how to construct one of those
1566,machines. 
1567,REEGAN: Clever. 
1568,TALTALIAN: And he has got to be stopped. 
1569,"REEGAN: All right, I'll deal with him. And since your own skin's in"

1575,"DOCTOR: No, not a scrap. "
1576,BRIGADIER: Then why accuse him? 
1577,DOCTOR: Something even his computers don't have. Intuition. I think I
1578,rattled him. 
1579,BRIGADIER: Taltalian was acting under Carrington's orders. Quinlan
1580,explained that. 
1581,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know, I heard him. And I didn't believe a word of it. "
1582,BRIGADIER: Why not? 
1583,"DOCTOR: Well, first they try keeping us in the dark altogether and when"
1584,"that didn't work, they fall back on some prepared cover story."
1585,"Contagious radiation, indeed. "
1586,"BRIGADIER: Then what is happening, Doctor? "
1587,DOCTOR: I don't know. Perhaps I'll know better when I've built this
1588,device. 
1589,BRIGADIER: What's this? 
1590,DOCTOR: Advanced electronic equipment. I need it at once. 
1591,"BRIGADIER: Right, I'll see to it. "

1610,REEGAN: It's a delicate operation. It's quite simple. 
1611,(Reegan opens a briefcase. It contains dynamite and a timing device.) 
1612,REEGAN: All you have to do is set the dial to the time you require. How
1613,long do you need to get clear of the building? 
1614,"TALTALIAN: Ten minutes, maybe more. "
1615,REEGAN: Let's say quarter of an hour. We can't have you taking risks.
1616,"Now, you leave the case as near to the Doctor as you possibly can. You"
1617,slide these catches together and that starts the mechanism. Fifteen
1618,"minutes later, no more Doctor. "
1619,TALTALIAN: But what if he should try to open the case while I am still
1620,away? 
1621,"REEGAN: The same result, a little earlier. "
1622,TALTALIAN: It's too risky. 
1623,REEGAN: It's you he's after. 
1624,TALTALIAN: Very well.

1641,"on your staff. Not, I'll admit, in the rather primitive contraptions"
1642,"that you use, but I'll manage. "
1643,"CORNISH: Doctor, I don't think you realise what's "
1644,DOCTOR: I can also withstand considerably more G-force than most
1645,"people, even though I do say so myself. "
1646,CORNISH: Well if you insist. You can take the tests. 
1647,"DOCTOR: Tests, simulations, anything you like. When that recovery"
1648,"capsule is ready, I'll take it up. "

1653,TALTALIAN: All but the final phase. 
1654,"CORNISH: Well, let me have them as soon as possible, will you? I'll see"
1655,"about those tests, Doctor. "

1691,"DOCTOR: A lot of good it did me, and him. "
1692,BRIGADIER: He was obviously trying to plant a time bomb on you. Lucky
1693,for you the mechanism was faulty. 
1694,DOCTOR: I'm not sure that it was. Look at this. See this is set to
1695,zero. Taltalian must have thought that he had plenty of time to get
1696,"away, when in fact this bomb was set to go off instantaneously. "
1697,BRIGADIER: So whoever gave it to him wanted to get rid of both of you? 
1698,"DOCTOR: Yes. Taltalian was a weak link, you know. I think his employers"
1699,wanted him out of the way. 
1700,BRIGADIER: Another dead end then? 
1701,"DOCTOR: Yeah, I'm afraid so. "
1702,(The Doctor takes a second device out of the cupboard.)

1868,CORNISH: No. We can't get enough of the standard fuel in time. 
1869,DOCTOR: Hasn't the death of Sir James Quinlan made things any easier
1870,for you?

2415,DOCTOR: You've conditioned their minds. 
2416,ALIEN: It was necessary to for their health. They were deteriorating. 
2417,DOCTOR: Why have you taken them prisoner? 
2418,ALIEN: Why have you not returned our ambassadors? 
2419,DOCTOR: Ambassadors? 
2420,ALIEN: An agreement was made. You have betrayed us. Unless our

2428,BRIGADIER: Half a mile wide? It must be a meteor. 
2429,CORNISH: Meteors don't stand still. 
2430,CARRINGTON: It's quite obviously an alien spacecraft. We must attack
2431,and destroy it. 
2432,"BRIGADIER: What about the Doctor? If that is a spacecraft, he may be on"
2433,board. 
2434,CARRINGTON: He must be dead by now. We could use missiles with atomic
2435,warheads. 
2436,CORNISH: Until we know for certain that 
2437,CARRINGTON: We do know. I've got a plane to catch. There's an emergency

2440,"CARRINGTON: Yes, this object has been spotted by observers all over the"
2441,world. 
2442,"BRIGADIER: What are you going to tell the council, sir? "
2443,CARRINGTON: I shall recommend an immediate all out attack. We must
2444,defend ourselves while there is still time. (Carrington leaves.) 
2445,CORNISH: The man's mad. 
2446,BRIGADIER: Not necessarily. We don't know what that thing is there. 
2447,CORNISH: Then surely we should find out. 
2448,BRIGADIER: Perhaps someone's found out already. 
2449,CORNISH: What do you mean? 
2450,BRIGADIER: I have a feeling that General Carrington knows a great deal
2451,"more than he's telling us. He went on a Mars probe himself, remember."
2452,Perhaps he discovered something. 
2453,CORNISH: Then why doesn't he tell us? 
2454,BRIGADIER: I don't know. 
2455,CORNISH: Are you supporting his plan to attack blindly?

2457,"to us, that the Doctor is still alive."

2461, DOCTOR: What you tell me is appalling. The
2462,authorities on Earth had no knowledge of this. 
2463,ALIEN: That is difficult to believe. 
2464,"DOCTOR: Nevertheless, you must believe me. Now let me go back to Earth,"
2465,and I will give you my personal assurance that your ambassadors will be
2466,returned to you. 
2467,ALIEN: But you do not even know where they are. 
2468,"DOCTOR: From the information that you've given me, I'll find them. Now,"
2469,"please, you must let me try. "
2470,"ALIEN: Very well. But if our ambassadors are not returned, we shall use"
2471,our weapons to destroy your world. 
2472,"DOCTOR: These three men, can I take them back with me? "
2473,ALIEN: They will remain here until our ambassadors are returned. Now
2474,you can go back to your spaceship.

2480,"VAN LYDEN: Oh, good. "
2481,"MICHAELS: Oh, er, send us something in to eat, will you? "

2500,BRIGADIER: Anything happening? 
2501,CORNISH: The Americans are sending up an unmanned satellite. Did this
2502,man Lennox tell you anything? 
2503,BRIGADIER: He's been murdered. 
2504,CORNISH: In your own headquarters? 
2505,BRIGADIER: Someone put an isotope in his cell. 
2506,"CORNISH: You're not having a great deal of success are you, Brigadier? "
2507,BRIGADIER: No. 
2508,"CORNISH: The astronauts are still missing, Miss Shaw kidnapped, Doctor"
2509,Taltalian killed and now this man Lennox murdered under your very nose.
2510,
2511,BRIGADIER: We're following up every possible clue. 
2512,CORNISH: And what have you discovered? 
2513,BRIGADIER: We've identified the two radioactive bodies that were found
2514,in that gravel pit in Hertfordshire. They weren't foreign agents at
2515,"all, they were petty London criminals. And the explosive that killed"
2516,Doctor Taltalian was the new H37 compound which hasn't even been issued
2517,to the Army yet. 
2518,CORNISH: Then our own people could be involved. 
2519,BRIGADIER: That was the Doctor's theory. Also forensics have analysed
2520,the mud that was found on the shoes Lennox was wearing. 
2521,CORNISH: And what does that tell you? 
2522,"BRIGADIER: Well, it could tell us where he'd been recently. You see,"
2523,there were elements of insecticide in that mud. We're now checking all
2524,the areas where that insecticide is used. 
2525,"CORNISH: This isotope that killed Lennox, have you checked on that? "
2526,BRIGADIER: It was part of a consignment sold some months ago. 
2527,CORNISH: Who was the buyer? 
2528,BRIGADIER: A bogus company with an address that doesn't even exist. 
2529,CORNISH: You've been very thorough. 
2530,BRIGADIER: It doesn't seem to have got me anywhere. 
2531,MAN: Urgent message. Pulses from unidentified object have ceased. 
2532,"DOCTOR : Hello, Space Control? Can you hear me? "

2535,"DOCTOR [on screen]: Yes, thank you. "
2536,"CORNISH: Doctor, have you found the astronauts? "

2540,DOCTOR [on screen]: I shall maintain radio silence until the necessary
2541,landing instructions. 
2542,BRIGADIER: Have you found out what's behind all this? 
2543,"DOCTOR [on screen]: Brigadier, put all your men on stand by. I shall"
2544,explain everything to you when I land. 
2545,"CORNISH: Doctor, what happened to my astronauts? Control to Recovery 7."
2546,Do you read me? 
2547,"BRIGADIER: It's no good, Cornish. He won't talk until he wants to. I"

2580,LIZ: What's the alternative? 
2581,REEGAN: I kill you and buy myself another scientist.

2730,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. No, that's a much simpler model. That would only"
2731,receive one-way signals. 
2732,REEGAN: Could you build me a better one so I could really talk to them?
2733,
2734,"DOCTOR: I dare say, if I had the proper equipment. I was going to build"
2735,one. Never did get a chance to get round to it. 
2736,REEGAN: You've got your chance now. 
2737,DOCTOR: You expect me to help you? 
2738,REEGAN: It would keep you both alive. 
2739,"DOCTOR: Well, I shall need a lot of expensive equipment. "
2740,REEGAN: Make a list. 
2741,DOCTOR: Very well. Thank you. 
2742,(The Doctor starts writing as Reegan goes up the stairs and opens the
2743,door. The Doctor points at the phone and Liz shakes her head. The
2744,Doctor goes to the stairs but Reegan is standing at the top.) 
2745,REEGAN: Don't try it. 
2746,(Reegan leaves.) 
2747,DOCTOR: Is there a way out? 
2748,"LIZ: I got out once, but they caught me. Now they've doubled the"
2749,guards. 
2750,"DOCTOR: Right, let's get on with that list. "
2751,LIZ: Are you really going to help them? 
2752,"DOCTOR: Well, if we can't get out to the Brigadier, we must bring the"
2753,Brigadier to us. 
2754,(Carrington enters.) 
2755,LIZ: General Carrington! 
2756,CARRINGTON: Miss Shaw. 
2757,LIZ: How on Earth did you find us? 
2758,(Then the penny drops.) 
2759,DOCTOR: I think the General knew all along. 
2760,CARRINGTON: You're not surprised to see me? 
2761,"DOCTOR: Not particularly, no. "
2762,"CARRINGTON: I'm surprised to see you, Doctor. My instructions were that"
2763,you were to be killed. 
2764,"DOCTOR: Then somebody disobeyed your instructions, didn't they. "
2765,"CARRINGTON: I shall have to attend to the matter myself. I'm sorry,"
2766,Doctor. It's my moral duty. 
2767,(Carrington points his pistol at the Doctor's head.)

2772,(Reegan enters.) 
2773,REEGAN: What are you doing? 
2774,CARRINGTON: You told me you killed this man. 
2775,"REEGAN: I was going to, but "
2776,CARRINGTON: You disobeyed an order. 
2777,REEGAN: I thought it was for the best. 
2778,"CARRINGTON: You're not paid to think, Reegan. "
2779,REEGAN: He can be useful. 
2780,CARRINGTON: I make the decisions. 
2781,"REEGAN: Yes, sir, but he's the only one that can make a machine that"
2782,will let us talk to these creatures. 
2783,CARRINGTON: You've got a machine to do that. 
2784,"REEGAN: This thing only sends limited one way signals. Look, if I'm"
2785,"going to carry out your orders, I'll have to give them some pretty"
2786,"complicated information. Still, suit yourself. You want to kill him,"
2787,kill him. 
2788,"(After a pause, Carrington holsters his pistol.) "
2789,CARRINGTON: Could you make us a better machine? 
2790,"DOCTOR: Given the necessary equipment, yes. "
2791,CARRINGTON: And you're willing to help us? 
2792,DOCTOR: It depends on what you're trying to do. 
2793,LIZ: Doctor! 
2794,"DOCTOR: Liz! Well, General? "
2795,CARRINGTON: We must alert the world to the menace of an alien invasion.
2796,
2797,DOCTOR: When do you expect this invasion? 
2798,CARRINGTON: At any time. 
2799,DOCTOR: They told me that their intentions were peaceful. That these
2800,three beings here were ambassadors. 
2801,CARRINGTON: Ambassadors! That was just to put us off our guard. 
2802,"DOCTOR: You're convinced their intentions are hostile, then? "
2803,CARRINGTON: Why else should they invade the galaxy? They were on Mars
2804,before we were. 
2805,"DOCTOR: Ah, so that's when you met them. When you were on a previous"
2806,Mars Probe. 
2807,"CARRINGTON: Yes, they killed Jim. Jim Daniels, fellow astronaut, simply"
2808,by touching him. 
2809,"DOCTOR: Yes, but they didn't know their touch would kill human beings. "
2810,CARRINGTON: And now they've walked into my trap. I knew that once I got
2811,them here I'd make them reveal their true natures. 
2812,"DOCTOR: So it was you who sent for those three ambassadors, was it? "
2813,LIZ: And hired Reegan to kidnap them and use them as killers? 
2814,CARRINGTON: It was the only way to arouse public opinion. 
2815,DOCTOR: Was Sir James Quinlan in on this? 
2816,CARRINGTON: No. He just wanted the political glory of being the first
2817,to arrange contact with an intelligent alien species. He didn't know of
2818,my plan to save the world. He wouldn't have understood. 
2819,LIZ: What about Van Lyden and the other astronauts? The human ones? 
2820,CARRINGTON: They didn't know either. It was the only way. 
2821,"DOCTOR: Well, I must say you've been very thorough, General. "
2822,"CARRINGTON: It was the only way. You do understand that, don't you,"
2823,Doctor? 
2824,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I understand. You had to do what you had to do. "
2825,CARRINGTON: Exactly. We must protect the world. It's our moral duty.
2826,Will you help us? 
2827,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I'll build your machine for you. "
2828,CARRINGTON: Splendid! This man can be of use to us. Give him everything
2829,he needs. 
2830,REEGAN: Okay. 
2831,CARRINGTON: I'm going to take one of those creatures with me. I've
2832,brought a shielded van. Kindly ask one of them to come out.

2868,"DOCTOR: Look, I'm not building a crystal set, you know. "
2869,(Masters opens the isolation chamber door.) 
2870,LIZ: Doctor. 
2871,(Reegan uses his simple device to bring the aliens out.) 
2872,"DOCTOR: Look, if you let them out, how am I going to test it? "
2873,REEGAN: They'll be back. 
2874,"DOCTOR: What, more killing? "
2875,REEGAN: Only if we have to. Get on with it. I want that machine
2876,finished by the time I get back. 
2877,(Reegan and Masters leave with the aliens.) 
2878,LIZ: You're not just going to do as he tells you? 
2879,"DOCTOR: Come on, Liz, let's get on with it. We haven't got much time,"
2880,you know. 
2881,(Reegan lets the aliens out at an unsuspecting government facility. One
2882,security guard is killed when the aliens open the gates. The other

2893,CARRINGTON: Quite sure. 
2894,WAKEFIELD: If there is some sort of alien creature inside that
2895,spacesuit 
2896,CARRINGTON: As I can assure you there is. 
2897,"WAKEFIELD: Has it occurred to you, sir, that this may create world"
2898,panic? 
2899,(Reegan gets a large crate labelled Isotope Radioactive and gets it
2900,back to the van on an electric trolley. The police arrive at the main
2901,gate so Reegan orders the aliens to attack. Then they all get in the

2909,CARRINGTON: You see? They've already landed. These creatures need
2910,radiation to live and they're prepared to rob and murder to get it. 
2911,BRIGADIER: Sir! 
2912,CARRINGTON: Yes. 
2913,BRIGADIER: There were men helping them. 
2914,"CARRINGTON: Traitors. Collaborators, like your friend the Doctor. "
2915,"BRIGADIER: That is an unjustified assumption, sir! "
2916,CARRINGTON: Is it? 
2917,"WAKEFIELD: General, what exactly do you intend to say in your telecast?"
2918,"It'll be on a world wide hook-up, you know. "
