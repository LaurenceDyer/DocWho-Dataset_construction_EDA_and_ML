20, Episode One
21,
22, [Tardis]
23,
24,(The Doctor has regenerated after his ordeal with
25,the Cybermen and energy-draining Mondas. Ben and Polly watched him
26,change into a younger person.) 
27,"POLLY: His face, his hair, look at it. "
28,"BEN: He's breathing, and the Tardis seems to be normal. "
29,"POLLY: Ben, what are we going to do? We can't just leave the Doctor"
30,there. 
31,"BEN: What, him? The Doctor? "
32,"POLLY: Well, that's who came through the doors. There was no one else"
33,"outside. Ben, do you remember what he said in the tracking room?"
34,Something about 'This old body of mine is wearing a bit thin.' 
35,BEN: So he gets himself a new one? 
36,"POLLY: Well, yes. "
37,"BEN: Oh, do me a favour. "
38,"POLLY: Then whatever happened, happened in here. "
39,BEN: But it's impossible. 
40,POLLY: Not so long ago we'd have been saying that about a lot of
41,things. 
42,(The man on the floor moans and opens his eyes. As he struggles to sit
43,"up, a searing pain nearly cripples him. Clutching his head, he stares"
44,"wildly at Ben and Polly, his vision blurred. We hear the thumping of"
45,"his headache, or is it heartbeat?) "
46,DOCTOR: Stop. Stop. Concentrate on one thing. One thing. 
47,"(The man turns his attention to the Tardis console, focusing on the"
48,controls. The thumping becomes slower and softer. At last his vision
49,"clears. The man removes his hands from his face and looks around him,"
50,his features brightening in relief.) 
51,DOCTOR: It's over. (chuckles) It's over. 
52,"(The man scrambles to his feet, wobbling unsteadily. Ben and Polly"
53,watch but make no attempt to help as he circles the Tardis console as
54,if
55,reacquainting himself with the controls. His clothes hang off his
56,"slight frame, much too big, and he struggles to unfasten the heavy"
57,"cloak that threatens to trip him up. As he does so, an ornate ring"
58,drops to the floor.) 
59,BEN: Doctor? 
60,"(As the Tardis engine springs to life and dematerialises, the man"
61,"raises his hands to his face once more, feeling his features as if they"
62,"belonged to a stranger. Polly moves to pick up the fallen ring, eyeing"
63,the newcomer with open curiosity and a little unease. The little man
64,"makes his way over to a storage chest, his stiff-legged gait reminding"
65,"Polly of a small child learning to walk. He trips, but recovers"
66,quickly.) 
67,DOCTOR: The muscles are still a bit tight. 
68,BEN: What are we going to do? 
69,POLLY: It is the Doctor. I know it is. I think. 
70,BEN: It's not only his face that's changed. He doesn't even act like
71,him. 
72,(The stranger is rummaging through the contents of the chest.) 
73,"BEN: Come on, it's time we sorted this out. Now look here! "
74,DOCTOR: Hold that. 
75,(He hands Ben a mirror.) 
76,DOCTOR: Tilt it. 
77,(The man gazes intently at his reflection. The face in the mirror has a
78,mop of black hair and dark green eyes. Momentarily the image blurs and
79,"changes to that of an older, white-haired man before changing back"
80,"again. Apparently satisfied, the man turns his attention back to the"
81,storage chest.) 
82,BEN: Have you done with this? 
83,DOCTOR: Put it down. Put it down. 
84,BEN: Now what's the game? 
85,"(The man turns, cheerfully brandishing an ornamental dagger.) "
86,"DOCTOR: Ah! The Crusades, from Saladin. The Doctor was a great"
87,"collector, wasn't he? "
88,POLLY: But you're the Doctor. 
89,"DOCTOR: Oh, I don't look like him. "
90,BEN: Who are we? 
91,DOCTOR: Don't you know? 
92,(The man rummages further and pulls out a piece of dull silver metal.
93,His look of mischief fades as the object triggers a very clear memory.)
94,
95,DOCTOR: Extermination. 
96,(The man stuffs the metal into his pocket. His concern turns to delight
97,as he unearths a magnifying glass. He begins a careful study of his
98,hands.) 
99,DOCTOR: Ah. Very good. Nails need growing. 
100,(Ben takes the Doctor's ring from Polly.) 
101,"BEN: Now look, the Doctor always wore this. So if you're him, it should"
102,"fit now, shouldn't it? "
103,(And slips it on the man's finger. It's far too big.) 
104,BEN: There. That settles it. 
105,DOCTOR: I'd like to see a butterfly fit into a chrysalis case after
106,it's spread its wings. 
107,POLLY: Then you did change! 
108,DOCTOR: Life depends on change and renewal. 
109,"BEN: Oh, so that's it. You've been renewed, have you? "
110,"DOCTOR: I've been renewed, have I? That's it. I've been renewed. It's"
111,"part of the Tardis. Without it, I couldn't survive. Come here. "
112,"(Unexpectedly, the man rounds on Polly.) "
113,DOCTOR: Come here. 
114,"(Still rather nervous of this strange interloper, Polly steps closer.) "
115,"DOCTOR: The Doctor kept a diary, didn't he? "
116,POLLY: Yes. 
117,DOCTOR: I thought so. I wonder where. I wonder where. 
118,(Ben and Polly watch as the man resumes his search of the chest.) 
119,"POLLY: He's a very different Doctor, Ben. "
120,"BEN: Yeah, maybe. Just where do we stand, though? "
121,(The man has found something else in the chest. A descant recorder. He
122,removes it with great care and stands flexing his fingers over the
123,"holes. His expression is one of pure child-like joy, and convinces"
124,Polly that it's time for her to trust her instincts about the man's
125,"identity. He plays a little tune and dances a jig, stopping when he"
126,spots the missing diary.) 
127,POLLY: Doctor? 
128,"(Tucking the recorder into his jacket, the Doctor begins to read.) "
129,"POLLY: Doctor, what's going to happen to us? "
130,DOCTOR: I think. I think we must have landed for sometime. I think it's
131,time we went for a stroll. 
132,(The Doctor grabs a stove-pipe hat from the chest. Engrossed in his
133,"reading, he moves to the console and opens the Tardis doors.) "
134,POLLY: But you don't know where we've landed! 
135,"BEN: No, you haven't checked the oxygen or the temperature or anything!"
136,
137,"DOCTOR: (still reading the diary) Oxygen density 172, radiation nil,"
138,"temperature 86. Strong suggestion of mercury deposits. Satisfied, Ben?"
139,"Now, are you two coming or are you not? "
140,POLLY: He does know us. He said Ben. Didn't you hear him? 
141,"BEN: Yeah, I heard. But he might just have been copying you though,"
142,mightn't he?
143,
144,[Mercury swamp]
145,
146,(The Tardis has landed in a misty swamp. The ground
147,is rocky and pitted with small bubbling pools which occasionally spray
148,"a fine silver mist into the air. The Doctor wanders away, still"
149,fascinated by the contents of the diary. Strolling directly towards a
150,"small pool of mercury, he is apparently oblivious to any danger, yet"
151,manages to successfully circumnavigate the obstacle without once
152,"looking up from his reading. Suddenly realising what he's done, he"
153,"stops and looks back, delighted at having outwitted the obstruction and"
154,laughs. But then he looks down and sloshes out of the watery puddle in
155,which he is now standing.) 
156,"DOCTOR: Are you coming, you two? "
157,(The Doctor continues on his way. After a short distance he stops once
158,more. A boulder blocks his path. Pulling a tape measure from his
159,"pocket, he takes some extensive measurements of the rock, and scribbles"
160,some calculations on an empty page of the diary. The Doctor glances
161,round him. The boulder stands in a clearing and he could easily walk
162,"round it, but a look of mischief crosses his face. Backing up a few"
163,"steps, the Doctor looks down at his legs, flexing his knees.) "
164,"DOCTOR: Time I put you through some tests, I think. "
165,"(Breaking into a run, the Doctor successfully leap-frogs the boulder.) "
166,EXAMINER: Hello? 
167,(A newcomer has entered the clearing.) 
168,EXAMINER: Hello? Is there anyone there? Hello? Hello? Why don't they
169,"come? (sees the Doctor) Ah, so you've come at last. I'm from Earth. I'm"
170,the Examiner. 
171,"(There's a gun shot. The man crumples to the ground. Horrified, the"
172,"Doctor's about to dive for cover then pauses and, keeping low,"
173,"approaches the fallen figure. He rolls the man over, and sees that he"
174,"is dead. Searching for some kind of identification, the Doctor finds a"
175,large round badge. Automatically reaching into his top pocket he pulls
176,out a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and puts them on. He squints at
177,"the badge and moves it backwards and forwards, trying to focus on it,"
178,yet all he can see is a misty blur. He removes the spectacles and tries
179,again. This time the text is clear.) 
180,DOCTOR: Earth Examiner. Accord every access. Vulcan. 
181,"(Behind the Doctor, a figure looms out of the mist, wearing an"
182,all-concealing white suit and goggles. The figure trains a pistol on
183,the Doctor's back.) 
184,"BEN: Doctor, where are you? "
185,"(The Doctor turns. The figure dodges out of sight. Close to the Tardis,"
186,Ben and Polly are exploring the swamp.) 
187,"BEN: Phwoar, ain't it hot. "
188,POLLY: Do you think the air's like this everywhere? 
189,"BEN: Nah, might be just around here. Don't want too many lungfuls of"
190,"it, I know that. Here, when I was a kid, we used to live opposite a"
191,brewery. You could take a walk and get tipsy all in one go. 
192,POLLY: It's beautiful. 
193,"BEN: No, don't touch it, Polly. "
194,POLLY: I wasn't going to. 
195,"BEN: No, it's quicksilver. It gets through the pores. Where is the"
196,"Doctor, or whatever he is, got to? "
197,"(As Ben moves away, a cloud of mercury vapour catches Polly full in the"
198,face. She coughs.) 
199,"BEN: What's the matter? Hey, Polly! Hey, Doctor, wherever you are."
200,"Quick, there's something happening to Polly! "
201,(The Doctor heads back to the Tardis at a run.) 
202,BEN: Quick! Over this way! 
203,"(Pistol raised as a bludgeon, the suited figure steps out behind the"
204,Doctor and knocks him down. The Doctor grabs at the figure briefly
205,"before sinking to the ground, unconscious. Working quickly, the"
206,stranger presses something into the Doctor's palm then drags the
207,"Examiner's body away. The Doctor is left sprawled on the ground, a"
208,button clutched in his outstretched hand.) 
209,"(Meanwhile, Ben is trying to drag the unconscious Polly to safety."
210,Another cloud of mercury vapour rises from the pool.) 
211,BEN: Doctor! 
212,"(The last thing Ben sees before he passes out, is a white suited figure"
213,holding a pistol approaching fast.) 
214,"(Some time later, a young man in a white survival suit, goggles pushed"
215,"up over his head, is kneeling besides the seemingly"
216,"unconscious Doctor. Another older man, similarly attired, approaches.) "
217,"BRAGEN: Ah, Quinn, there you are. What have you got there? My people"
218,have found two more of them by one of the pools. 
219,QUINN: This one's got a nasty bruise on the back of his head. Fallen
220,"over his feet and knocked himself out, I suppose. "
221,BRAGEN: I suppose so. 
222,QUINN: Why don't they use the kit we send them? 
223,BRAGEN: Yes. The other two have had a rather bad dose of fumes. The
224,"girl has, anyway. "
225,QUINN: Girl? 
226,"BRAGEN: Yes, but she'll recover. "
227,(Ben and Polly are helped into the clearing by two guards.) 
228,QUINN: These comic opera guards of yours do have some uses after all. 
229,BRAGEN: I pick them for their physical fitness. 
230,QUINN: I thought it wasn't for their IQ. Give me a hand with the
231,"Examiner, will you. "
232,BRAGEN: I wonder why Earth has chosen to send an Examiner to Vulcan?
233,"Just now, I mean. "
234,QUINN: I don't know. 
235,"BRAGEN: It's a mystery, isn't it? He isn't due for another two years. "
236,(Ben is recovering.) 
237,QUINN: How do you feel? 
238,BEN: (cough) Urgh. 
239,QUINN: We saw your rocket overshoot the landing area. 
240,BEN: Ay? 
241,QUINN: Don't worry. Most of the ships from Earth do over-shoot. I'm
242,"Quinn, Deputy Governor. "
243,"BRAGEN: Bragen, Head of Security. "
244,"QUINN: Let's get them all back, shall we? I'll take the girl. "
245,"BRAGEN: Here, you two, help carry the Examiner. "
246,(The guards lift the Doctor between them.) 
247,BRAGEN: I suppose you Earth people can't wait to examine Lesterson's
248,space capsule? 
249,BEN: Ay? 
250,(Ben is startled as the Doctor winks slyly at him.)
251,
252, [Lesterson's laboratory]
253,
254,(Lesterson is polishing an oddly shaped piece of
255,metal. A huge space capsule dominates one side of the room. Lesterson's
256,"assistant, Janley, joins him.) "
257,JANLEY: (a woman) Lesterson. 
258,LESTERSON: Look at this. 
259,"JANLEY: They've just brought in an Examiner from Earth, and a couple of"
260,assistants. 
261,LESTERSON: An Examiner? What's he here for? 
262,JANLEY: I thought you'd know. 
263,"LESTERSON: It's the capsule, it must be. Well, they can't stop me"
264,"working on it, I'll tell you that. "
265,JANLEY: Could anyone? 
266,LESTERSON: The Governor's always been difficult about it. But surely
267,they wouldn't send somebody all the way from Earth just 
268,"JANLEY: Look, what about the meeting? "
269,LESTERSON: Meeting? 
270,JANLEY: Yes. I've arranged everything. Can we still use the old rocket
271,room? 
272,"LESTERSON: Yes, I suppose so. But I do wish you wouldn't get mixed up"
273,"with these pressure groups, Janley. "
274,"JANLEY: Well, somebody has to do something. The colony's running down"
275,and you know it. 
276,LESTERSON: I'm too busy. 
277,"JANLEY: But if we ran things, you'd have better facilities, more money."
278,I wish you'd take an interest. 
279,"LESTERSON: Now look, I don't mind letting you have the use of one of my"
280,"rooms now and again, Janley, but don't try to involve me. This is what"
281,I find important. Two hundred years in a mercury swamp and this piece
282,"of metal that dropped from it? Look, a couple of minutes polishing and"
283,it's as good as new. 
284,JANLEY: Wonderful. 
285,"LESTERSON: Rain, damp, heat, mercury. Nothing touches this metal. No"
286,"corrosion, Janley. Think of that. "
287,"JANLEY: Well, I hope the Examiner lets you go on with your experiment."
288,"Frankly, I doubt it. I think the Governor's brought the Examiner here"
289,"to stop you opening the capsule. You should join our group, Lesterson."
290,You might need us one day. 
291, [Guest quarters]
292,
293,"(Fully recovered, the Doctor, Ben and Polly have"
294,been left to make themselves comfortable. The Doctor is plays on his
295,recorder.) 
296,BEN: So the murdered man was the real Examiner? 
297,"(Nodding, the Doctor blows a pair of notes.) "
298,"BEN: Well, did you see who did it? "
299,(Top note screech.) 
300,POLLY: The Doctor got this button though. 
301,BEN: I think it's pretty dull around here. I don't know why we don't
302,just go back to the Tardis. 
303,"POLLY: Doctor, are you going to let them think you're the real"
304,Examiner? 
305,(Two notes repeated.) 
306,POLLY: Won't that be dangerous? 
307,(Two notes again.) 
308,"BEN: Look, why don't you stop blowing that thing and talk to us"
309,properly? 
310,POLLY: Ben! 
311,BEN: Now don't you start. It's bad enough with him. 
312,"POLLY: Well, he hasn't done anything. "
313,"BEN: No, that's just the trouble. "
314,(Ben snatches the recorder away.) 
315,"BEN: He knows what happened back at the Tardis, yet will he tell us?"
316,Will he come out and say? Will he admit to being the Doctor? 
317,(Ben blows angrily into the recorder. There is a knock on the door.) 
318,BEN: Come in! 
319,"(Two guards in peaked caps and dark uniforms enter, with Bragen and a"
320,large bearded man in his late fifties.) 
321,"HENSELL: I am Hensell, the Governor. I trust you're all feeling much"
322,better? 
323,"BEN: I've felt worse, Governor. The Governor. "
324,"HENSELL: If Earth had seen fit to warn us you were coming, we might"
325,possibly have been able to guide you down to the landing area. 
326,"DOCTOR: If Earth didn't warn you we were coming, Governor, they must"
327,have had a very good reason. I wonder what it was? 
328,"HENSELL: Now look here, I run this Colony. I'm entitled to know why you"
329,have come to Vulcan. What is your brief? 
330,DOCTOR: I am the Examiner. 
331,HENSELL: Why are you here? 
332,DOCTOR: To examine. And I intend to start my examination at once. 
333,(The Doctor darts forward and begins to examine Bragen's tunic.) 
334,"HENSELL: Someone's leaked reports about these Rebel groups. That's it,"
335,isn't it? 
336,"DOCTOR: Your turn now, Governor. "
337,(The Doctor turns his attention to Hensell's clothing.) 
338,BRAGEN: There is Lesterson's capsule. 
339,"HENSELL: Internal affairs are my business, Bragen. Please don't"
340,interfere. 
341,DOCTOR: Please go on. 
342,HENSELL: The capsule. It was found in a mercury swamp. It must have
343,been here for centuries. 
344,DOCTOR: Interesting. Continue. 
345,HENSELL: For centuries before the Earth colony arrived. I felt it might
346,be dangerous. It might contain bacteria. 
347,DOCTOR: I shall examine the capsule later. You may leave us. 
348,"HENSELL: I shall look forward to your report. Bragen, see that the"
349,"Examiner and his party get some proper clothes, will you? "
350,"(Hensell, Bragen, and the guards leave.) "
351,DOCTOR: We are wearing proper clothes. 
352,(The Doctor starts playing again.) 
353,"BEN: Oh, how did he get that thing back again. That was a bit of a"
354,"cheek, wasn't it, seeing if the Governor was the guy you got the button"
355,off? 
356,"POLLY: Doctor? When he was talking to you, you were staring at the"
357,other man. 
358,"DOCTOR: Yes, very rude of me, wasn't it. Terrible manners. To tell you"
359,"the truth, I was studying his reaction, seeing if he agreed with the"
360,story. 
361,BEN: Did he? 
362,DOCTOR: Must have a look at that capsule. 
363,"BEN: Now, you want to watch you don't take this Examiner stuff a bit"
364,too far. 
365,DOCTOR: Our answers must come from that mercury swamp. 
366,BEN: 'Cause at least one bloke ain't going to be fooled. 
367,"DOCTOR: When Bragen found us, he definitely said space capsule. "
368,"BEN: Look, you're not going to fool the guy that did the real Examiner"
369,in! 
370, [Corridor]
371,
372,"(A little later Bragen, accompanied by a guard, is"
373,posting a notice on a board. Quinn approaches.) 
374,QUINN: Bragen! What's all this nonsense about having to have a pass to
375,see the Examiner? 
376,BRAGEN: It's the Governor's idea. 
377,QUINN: Surely it doesn't apply to me? 
378,"BRAGEN: It's not my order, Quinn. I expect the Governor wants to keep"
379,people away from him. 
380,QUINN: It sounded like one of your red-tape ideas. 
381,BRAGEN: It had nothing to do with me. 
382,QUINN: Right! 
383,"(Quinn strides away, practically colliding with Janley.) "
384,JANLEY: Oh! 
385,"QUINN: Sorry, Janley. "
386,JANLEY: My fault. 
387,QUINN: Are you all right? 
388,JANLEY: Yes. Lesterson's just cleared me out of his lab. Is the
389,Examiner going to let him open the capsule? 
390,"QUINN: I don't know. I'm on my way there now, if I can push past"
391,Bragen's army of
392,lay-abouts. 
393, [Lesterson's laboratory]
394,
395,"(Later that evening, the Doctor takes Ben and Polly"
396,to see the space capsule. The Doctor spots the piece of metal that
397,"Lesterson was polishing earlier. He picks it up and examines it,"
398,worriedly.) 
399,DOCTOR: Where did you get this? 
400,LESTERSON: It dropped from the capsule. 
401,DOCTOR: Dropped? 
402,"LESTERSON: Yes, when it was being hauled into the laboratory. But, you"
403,"can see, this metal could revolutionise space travel. That's why I'm"
404,"insisting that we open it. Well, who knows what other marvels there may"
405,be inside? 
406,"HENSELL: But Lesterson, I didn't think you could open it. "
407,"LESTERSON: Well, I have a theory. I'm convinced that the opening"
408,"mechanism on the other side is either here, or here. "
409,"(While Lesterson is occupied, the Doctor pulls out the piece of metal"
410,he found in the Tardis and compares the two. They are identical.) 
411,DOCTOR: Extermination. 
412,"LESTERSON: Now, my theory is that I can insert a laser ray in this"
413,"ridge here. The ray spreads, fuses the opening device and gets us in. "
414,"HENSELL: Examiner, I shall have to make it your responsibility. "
415,DOCTOR: A laser. Why not? It shouldn't be too difficult. 
416,(The laser fires at the first spot. Nothing happens.) 
417,"LESTERSON: Well, we'll try the other side. "
418,(Lesterson refocuses the laser. A mechanism engages and the hatchway
419,slides open. The Doctor and Lesterson step into the capsule.
420,
421,[Capsule entry]
422,
423,(A small brightly lit chamber. The Doctor studies
424,the far wall. Everyone else crowds in.) 
425,LESTERSON: Hmm. It's a bit disappointing. 
426,"DOCTOR: Not really. This is just an entry bay, isn't it. "
427,"LESTERSON: Yes, I suppose so. "
428,"HENSELL: Well, this doesn't get us very far, does it? "
429,"LESTERSON: Getting into the rest of the capsule will take time,"
430,Governor. 
431,"BEN: Well, can't you use that torch thing again? That must be an"
432,opening door. 
433,LESTERSON: I should have to measure it up and find out where the lock
434,mechanism is. 
435,DOCTOR: I think we'll leave if for tonight. 
436,HENSELL: Leave it for tonight? But what did we come here for? 
437,"DOCTOR: That is my decision, Governor. "
438,"HENSELL: But good heavens above, man. "
439,DOCTOR: A hundred years you say this has been buried? 
440,"LESTERSON: Oh, at least. Now, there must be something in the inner"
441,compartment. We shall be able to find out where it came from
442,originally. 
443,DOCTOR: It didn't come from this planet Vulcan. 
444,"LESTERSON: Oh no, no, no. The metal is quite alien. "
445,"DOCTOR: Alien, yes. Very alien. Goodnight. "
446,(The Doctor leaves the laboratory.) 
447,BEN: What's he up to now? 
448,"POLLY: Ben, we're not going to let him out of our sight. "
449,(Ben and Polly follow the Doctor from the lab.) 
450,[Lesterson's laboratory]
451,
452,"HENSELL: Well, Lesterson, you got your way. Was it"
453,worth sending for this Examiner? This idiotic Examiner? 
454,LESTERSON: I didn't send for him. I thought you did. 
455,"QUINN: Why don't you let me talk to the Examiner, Hensell. I can find"
456,out what's he's here for. 
457,"HENSELL: No, no, no, no. You keep away from him. We'll leave him to"
458,work with Lesterson here. We've all got enough to do without having to
459,worry about some amateur critic from Earth interfering. 
460,QUINN: But with five minutes 
461,"HENSELL: You heard what I said, Quinn. You won't mind keeping the"
462,"Examiner busy, Lesterson? I don't mind what you do with him so long as"
463,you keep his nose out of our business. 
464,LESTERSON: Yes. All right. 
465,"HENSELL: All right. Well, we shall talk about it tomorrow. "
466,"(Once he's alone, Lesterson returns to his workbench where he quickly"
467,realises that his metal sample has disappeared.)

470,
471,(Later that night.) 
472,POLLY: Ben! 
473,BEN: (waking) What? 
474,POLLY: Shh! He's in the corridor. 
475,BEN: Who is? 
476,"POLLY: The Doctor, you clod. Come on, quick! "
477,[Corridor]
478,
479,POLLY: He's going towards Lesterson's lab. 
480,BEN: Of course. To the space capsule. 
481,POLLY: Come on.
482,
483, [Lesterson's laboratory]
484,
485,"(The Doctor steps into the deserted laboratory,"
486,which is eerily illuminated by the light glowing from the interior of
487,"the capsule. At the capsule entrance, he dips into his pockets and"
488,takes out the two pieces of metal. Ben and Polly appear in the doorway
489,of the lab just in time to see the Doctor disappear into the capsule.) 
490,[Capsule entrance]
491,
492,(The Doctor crosses to the far wall and inserts one
493,of the pieces of metal into a narrow opening. An inner door slides
494,"open, revealing a second compartment. The Doctor edges forward, peering"
495,into the gloom. Two shapes are silhouetted against the dull metal glow.
496,"Familiar, giant pepperpot shapes.) "
497,"DOCTOR: Polly, Ben, come in and meet the Daleks. "
498,BEN: What? 
499,DOCTOR: The Daleks. 
500,"(As Polly approaches, a sucker arm drops.) "
501,POLLY: You could have opened this before. 
502,DOCTOR: These two pieces of metal are identical. The Doctor got one of
503,them from the Daleks himself. 
504,BEN: Why do you keep saying the Doctor if you mean you? 
505,DOCTOR: I knew I should find them here. I knew it. 
506,"BEN: Ah, they look harmless. Not very lively. "
507,POLLY: What do you think? Two hundred years in a swamp and you wouldn't
508,"look very lively either. Nothing could live through that, could it? "
509,BEN: Live? 
510,"DOCTOR: Nothing human, no. "
511,"POLLY: Doctor, look. "
512,BEN: What's the matter? 
513,(The Doctor kneels to examine the marks on the dusty floor.) 
514,DOCTOR: There were three Daleks in here! What's happened to the other
515,one? 
516,(Ben catches sight of something moving in the corner behind the
517,Doctor.) 
518,BEN: Doctor! 
519,(Polly screams. The Doctor spins around. A clawed mutant scuttles from
520,the shadows across the floor.)

522, Episode Two
523,
524, [Capsule]
525,
526,"DOCTOR: A light. A torch, outside. "
527,BEN: Did you see it? 
528,"DOCTOR: Quickly, Ben, quickly! "
529,POLLY: What was it? 
530,(Ben runs out into the laboratory to look for the torch. He soon finds
531,"a lamp with a long lead and drags it back into the capsule, unaware"
532,"that he's being watched by Resno, one of Lesterson's assistants. The"
533,Doctor takes the lamp and begins checking every corner of the
534,compartment.) 
535,POLLY: Can you answer me? 
536,BEN: It was a sort of disembodied hand. A sort of claw. It was
537,horrible. 
538,(The Doctor searches for a while but doesn't find anything.) 
539,"DOCTOR: No. No, there's nothing. "
540,BEN: You were right. There were three Daleks. 
541,"POLLY: Don't you know what it was? If there were three, who moved it? "
542,BEN: Don't ask me. Lesterson? 
543,POLLY: But he hadn't opened the capsule. 
544,"BEN: No, he said he hadn't opened it. Lets get our facts straight. "
545,"DOCTOR: Ah ha. Excellent! Good thinking, good thinking. "
546,[Lesterson's laboratory]
547,
548,"BEN: Well, does that mean you think he's been"
549,inside? 
550,DOCTOR: Perhaps he's been experimenting on the Daleks? Ah. 
551,"POLLY: But, but they're things. I, I mean they're dead. They must be! "
552,DOCTOR: This light is dead. Now the watch. 
553,(The Doctor flicks the torch on and off.) 
554,BEN: Do you mean these things just need power? 
555,"DOCTOR: Now, Lesterson's fanatic. The Governor's jealous of his own"
556,position. What does that suggest to you? Don't know. Haven't thought
557,about it. But all is not well with this colony. Add to that one Dalek. 
558,"BEN: Oh, blimey, you don't half make mountains, don't you? One Dalek? "
559,DOCTOR: Yes! All that is needed to wipe out this entire colony.

562,
563,QUINN: Examiner? Examiner? 
564,(Bragen enters.) 
565,"QUINN: Bragen, don't you ever knock before you enter a room? "
566,BRAGEN: I'm sorry if I disturbed you. I was expecting to find the
567,"Examiner here, not you, Quinn. "
568,"QUINN: Well, he's not here. You'll probably want to start snooping"
569,"under the bed, so I'll leave you to it. "
570,BRAGEN: One moment. 
571,"QUINN: Don't try your luck with me, Bragen. "
572,"BRAGEN: On the contrary, I'm trying to avoid trouble. The Governor gave"
573,express instructions that you were not to contact the Examiner. I find
574,you here. I'm sure you can offer some suitable explanation. 
575,QUINN: I can. But not to you. 
576,BRAGEN: Before you go. Oh! 
577,(Quinn shoves Bragen to the floor.) 
578,QUINN: Don't ever try to block my way again. 
579,BRAGEN: Guard! 
580,(As Quinn leaves a guard enters and helps Bragen to his feet.) 
581,BRAGEN: The Examiner is missing. He must be found immediately.
582,
583,[Lesterson's laboratory]
584,
585,(The Doctor is examining the exterior of the
586,capsule.) 
587,"BEN: Of course, the real Doctor was always going on about the Daleks. "
588,POLLY: Real Doctor? 
589,"DOCTOR: Real Doctor? Oh, you mean the real Doctor. "
590,"BEN: Yeah, now I've seen that claw thing, well, wouldn't want to shake"
591,"hands with it, let's put it that way. "
592,"POLLY: Doctor, look, if they're that dangerous, what are you going to"
593,do about it? 
594,DOCTOR: Save my breath. Would Lesterson listen? Lesterson listen.
595,"Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen. Exercises the tongue. Try it."
596,"Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen. "
597,"BEN: Look, they think you're the Examiner, order them to destroy the"
598,"Daleks. Well, chuck your weight about. "
599,"POLLY: (in background) Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson"
600,"listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen. "
601,"POLLY + DOCTOR: Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen..."
602,
603,"(Behind them, Lesterson and Resno enter.) "
604,LESTERSON: What do you think you're doing in here? 
605,"DOCTOR: Listen, listen. "
606,(The Doctor holds out the Examiner's badge.) 
607,LESTERSON: Who gave you permission? 
608,DOCTOR: Read this. Aloud! 
609,LESTERSON: Accord every access. 
610,DOCTOR: Exactly! It doesn't say 'except your laboratory' anywhere does
611,it? Unless it's in micro-print. 
612,LESTERSON: I should have been asked first. 
613,DOCTOR: What was the first thing you noticed when you looked inside
614,that capsule? 
615,"BEN: Well, the Daleks. "
616,DOCTOR: You were astounded? 
617,POLLY: Yes. 
618,DOCTOR: Amazed? 
619,BEN: Yes. 
620,DOCTOR: You didn't even give them a glance! Why? Because you'd been in
621,there and seen them. Where is the third Dalek? 
622,LESTERSON: I don't know what you're talking about. 
623,DOCTOR: You opened up the capsule without permission. You found the
624,inner compartment containing three Daleks. You took one of them away
625,and you hid it! 
626,"LESTERSON: Hid it? What, what nonsense! "
627,BRAGEN: May I ask what all this is about? 
628,"POLLY: We opened an inner compartment in the capsule, and Lesterson had"
629,already been in there. 
630,LESTERSON: I don't deny that. 
631,BEN: And he's nicked a Dalek! 
632,BRAGEN: Dalek? 
633,LESTERSON: It's the name the Examiner has given to two metal creations
634,that I've discovered inside the capsule. 
635,BEN: And they're dangerous. Evil. 
636,LESTERSON: Lumps of metal. Quite inactive. 
637,"BEN: That's what you think, mate. If you'd seen "
638,(The Doctor's recorder silences Ben.) 
639,LESTERSON: I consider it my duty as a scientist to examine and
640,"investigate these objects. Now please, all of you, keep out of my"
641,laboratory. Keep your hands off my experiments! 
642,"DOCTOR: These lumps of metal, Daleks, I want them broken up, or melted"
643,"down. Up or down, I don't care which, but destroyed! "
644,LESTERSON: I refuse to allow it. 
645,DOCTOR: I'm an Earth Examiner. I demand it. 
646,LESTERSON: You're exceeding your authority. 
647,DOCTOR: Perhaps we should ask the Governor about that? I wish to see
648,him immediately. 
649,BRAGEN: That might be difficult. 
650,"DOCTOR: But not impossible. Ben, Polly. "
651,"(The Doctor, Ben, and Polly leave, followed by Bragen.) "
652,RESNO: Could he stop the experiments? 
653,LESTERSON: I don't know. It's none of your business. You go and get
654,Janley and then come back here. We haven't got any time to waste. Now
655,"go on, man. Quickly, quickly. "
656,(Resno leaves. Lesterson goes to the capsule and opens a hidden
657,"compartment, revealing the third Dalek.) "
658,LESTERSON: They won't stop me experimenting. There must be some way to
659,"bring you back to life, and I'm going to find it."
660,
661,[Guest quarters]
662,
663,BRAGEN: And of course you do have the right of any
664,access. 
665,DOCTOR: Which is why I have a badge which says so. 
666,BRAGEN: Lesterson watches over his ideas like a mother hen. 
667,DOCTOR: If there was a bomb under this floor timed to go off in five
668,"minutes, would you ask my permission before you ripped up the"
669,"floorboards? Ah ha, fruit! "
670,POLLY: Thank you. 
671,"BRAGEN: Examiner, it's up to you of course, but I'd advise a little"
672,"discretion in your investigations. It's not a very good time, just now."
673,
674,(The Doctor is generously distributing fruit from a bowl by the
675,bedside.) 
676,BRAGEN: Thank you. With all these disturbances 
677,POLLY: Disturbances? 
678,"BRAGEN: Yes, minor acts of sabotage. Rebel cliques, secret newspapers,"
679,"nothing important you understand, but it keeps the Governor busy. I've"
680,no doubt he'll tell you about it himself when I arrange your meeting
681,with him. 
682,BEN: When will that be? 
683,"BRAGEN: Oh, he's going on a tour of the perimeter of the colony. I'll"
684,find out if he can see you before he goes. 
685,POLLY: Thank you. 
686,(Bragen leaves. Polly sits next to Ben on the bed.) 
687,"BEN: You know, it's little things like this that make it difficult to"
688,"believe that you're the Doctor. The other one, I mean. The proper one."
689,"Oh, nuts, you know what I mean. "
690,"DOCTOR: Nuts? Yes, certainly, here we are. Crackers? "
691,"BEN: You, my old china, are an out and out phony! "
692,"DOCTOR: China. Yes, I went there once I believe. Met Marco Polo. "
693,"BEN: No, not China. China! China and plate, mate, friend. "
694,"DOCTOR: Yes, Marco Polo, a friend. I believe he was. "
695,"POLLY: Don't listen to him, Doctor. I know who you are. "
696,DOCTOR: Shh! 
697,(The Doctor gestures Polly into silence as he listens closely to a
698,piece of fruit he's chosen from the bowl. Gently placing the fruit on
699,"the table, he pulls a pen knife from his pocket and carefully slices"
700,the fruit in half.) 
701,POLLY: It's a 
702,(Concealed in the middle of the fruit is a tiny listening device.
703,"Indicating that Ben and Polly should remain silent, the Doctor extracts"
704,"the device, drops it to the floor and stamps down hard, crushing it.) "
705,"BEN: Well, well, a touch of the bugs. Microphones. "
706,POLLY: Someone's been listening to what we were saying! 
707,"BEN: Yes, so that's why you were messing about and talking nonsense. "
708,DOCTOR: I never talk nonsense. 
709,POLLY: Ahem. 
710,"DOCTOR: Well, hardly never. "
711,"BEN: Well, they certainly believe in making us at home, don't they? "
712,"DOCTOR: At first, I thought there might be more than one. "
713,"BEN: Here, I bet old Charlie Bragen did it. "
714,POLLY: Charlie? 
715,"BEN: Well Fred wouldn't suit him, would it. "
716,"POLLY: If he did do it, do you think it was his own idea? I mean, he"
717,could have been under orders. 
718,"BEN: You mean from the Governor? Ah, I don't know. What do you think,"
719,Doctor? 
720,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Yes of course. Let's consider this button for a"
721,moment. It's the only clue we've got to the murderer of the Examiner.
722,The real Examiner. 
723,POLLY: And who asked for him to come? 
724,"BEN: Well, Lesterson's crackers about that capsule. He wouldn't want"
725,anyone nosing about. 
726,POLLY: Bragen said the Governor's been having trouble. 
727,"BEN: No, rule him out. Governors are all the same. He wouldn't ask for"
728,help. If he sent the word it would look as if he couldn't do the job
729,properly. 
730,POLLY: Yes. 
731,"BEN: Oh, well, I vote we go back to the Tardis. I've had enough of this"
732,dump. 
733,DOCTOR: Have you? What about the Daleks? 
734,"BEN: Well, they're dead. "
735,"POLLY: Well, what about that thing we saw in the capsule? That was"
736,alive all right. 
737,"BEN: Yeah, I can't explain that. "
738,DOCTOR: I can. And that's why we have to stay.

741,
742,"RESNO: Ugly-looking brutes, aren't they? "
743,(Janley and Resno are wiring up the Dalek for testing.) 
744,"RESNO: What's he want to muck about with them for? Leave well alone,"
745,that's what I say. 
746,JANLEY: You're a fine one to be a research assistant. Leave well alone.
747,There'll be no progress on this planet with people like you around. 
748,RESNO: We're doing all right as we are. Or we were until your lot came
749,"along stirring things up. You won't get away with it, you know. The"
750,Governor knows all about you rebels. He'll smash the lot of you when
751,he's ready. 
752,JANLEY: Governor? 
753,"RESNO: Yeah, the Governor! "
754,JANLEY: He couldn't smash 
755,LESTERSON: Will you be quiet! Where do you both think you are? This is
756,"a scientific laboratory. Kindly keep your politics out of it. Come on,"
757,"Resno, man, get on with it. We haven't got all day. We've got to get"
758,this working before the Examiner stops us. He's got some phobia about
759,"these, these Daleks."

761,[Guest quarters]
762,
763,(The Doctor is sitting on the bed clutching his
764,diary.) 
765,"DOCTOR: I know the misery they cause, the destruction. But there's"
766,something else more terrible. Something I can only half remember. 
767,"POLLY: Doctor, what was it? "
768,(A knock at the door. Bragen enters.) 
769,DOCTOR: Well? Where is the Governor? What did he say? 
770,"BRAGEN: He sends his apologies, Examiner. He can't see you tonight, but"
771,he hopes to see you first thing in the morning. 
772,"BEN: Well, it might not wait that long, Char, ah, Bragen. "
773,BRAGEN: It will have to. 
774,DOCTOR: Excuse me. 
775,BEN: Where are you going? 
776,"DOCTOR: To see the Governor, of course. "
777,"BRAGEN: I'm afraid that's not possible. Once his door is closed, no"
778,"one, not even you, Examiner, is allowed into his room. "
779,DOCTOR: Very well. 
780,BRAGEN: Thank you. Until the morning then. 
781,(Bragen leaves.) 
782,BEN: What happens now? 
783,"DOCTOR: I shall radio Earth. Governor or not, Hensell will have to"
784,listen to them. I'll get Earth to back me. 
785,(Suddenly the Doctor yanks open the door. The corridor is empty.) 
786,DOCTOR: That's funny. I could have sworn. You stay here. I shan't be
787,long.

800,"RESNO: Really, if you can't trust me to read a dial. "
801,"LESTERSON: Be quiet. All right, we'll try again. This time we'll take"
802,"it up to 3.24. Got that, Janley? "
803,JANLEY: 3.24. 
804,"(Very slowly, the Dalek's sucker arm begins to rise.) "
805,RESNO: It's moving. 
806,"LESTERSON: Now, note this, Janley. Number one attachment with sucker"
807,stick responding. Number two attachment not moving. Number three
808,"attachment with lens responding. Watch these meters, Resno. "
809,RESNO: Still responding. 
810,"LESTERSON: Now, it's reasonable to assume that this the sucker stick"
811,acts like some kind of a hand. 
812,(Janley screams.) 
813,LESTERSON: It's all right. Don't be alarmed. We've only introduced
814,temporary power. We shall have to be able to open it up before we could
815,find how it works permanently. 
816,JANLEY: It's a bit frightening. 
817,"LESTERSON: Yes. Now, I cannot think what this short stubby arm is for. "
818,JANLEY: Could the lens attachment be an eye? 
819,"LESTERSON: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Now it's quite possible that this,"
820,"Dalek, now there must be some kind of directing influence. There may"
821,"even be a simplified brain. Positronic, I shouldn't wonder. Oh, if only"
822,we could open it up. 
823,(The sucker arm drops suddenly.) 
824,LESTERSON: Now what? 
825,RESNO: Everything functioning here. 
826,"LESTERSON: Yes. Well, perhaps the power is leaking away somewhere."
827,We'll try again. 
828,(Janley increases the power supply to the Dalek. The Dale's eye-stick
829,rises slowly.) 
830,RESNO: Look at the eye-stick! It's watching us! 
831,LESTERSON: Don't be absurd. 
832,"RESNO: It was, I tell you. I saw it. "
833,LESTERSON: You can't use the phrase 'watching us'. You'll have us
834,"believing that the thing has intelligence next. Now, get on with your"
835,"work, man."

840,semi-darkness. The place is a mess. The equipment has been sabotaged

850,QUINN: What do you want? 
851,DOCTOR: I found the operator unconscious. 
852,"QUINN: Yes, so did I. I was just looking at him when I heard someone"
853,move. It must have been you. 
854,BRAGEN: And those? 
855,(Quinn is holding a set of wire cutters.) 
856,QUINN: I picked them up. What is all this? 
857,DOCTOR: The cables have been cut. 
858,QUINN: What? This is serious. It's not just our own communications.
859,We're cut off from Earth as well. 
860,BRAGEN: The only people that would want to do that are the rebels. 
861,"QUINN: If those muscle boys of yours had any brains, they'd stop things"
862,like this. 
863,"DOCTOR: Bragen, I was attacked just after I landed. This is a small"
864,souvenir I collected. 
865,"BRAGEN: This button belongs to you, doesn't it? "
866,"QUINN: Well, yes. "
867,BRAGEN: And you say you picked these up? I suggest that you were
868,sabotaging the communications. 
869,QUINN: That's a lie. 
870,BRAGEN: Having first attacked one of the engineers. I'd detain the
871,Governor on evidence like that. 
872,"QUINN: I hope you're not thinking of detaining me, Bragen. "
873,BRAGEN: I've no option. I could hardly let you run around loose after
874,"this, could I? All right, guards. "
875,"QUINN: I warn you, Bragen! "
876,"(As the guards close around him, Quinn relaxes.) "
877,"QUINN: All right, you win this round, Bragen. We'll see what it looks"
878,like in front of the Governor. 
879,BRAGEN: The Governor will want an enquiry. May I ask what you were
880,doing here?
881,
882,[Lesterson's laboratory]
883,
884,(Resno has set up a camera on a tripod in front of
885,the Dalek.) 
886,LESTERSON: Right. I've redirected power. This time working up to 4.68.
887,"Now, Resno, you will have to dodge between the camera and your meters. "
888,RESNO: Ready. 
889,LESTERSON: Connecting now. 
890,RESNO: All connections responding. 
891,LESTERSON: Excellent. 
892,JANLEY: It's working! 
893,"LESTERSON: Excellent. Film it, film it now, Resno. And note the"
894,"readings, Janley. "
895,(The Dalek's eye-stick spins around and fixes on Resno.) 
896,"LESTERSON: It seems to be interested in you, Resno. What's the matter"
897,"with you, man? "
898,"RESNO: I tell you it's intelligent. It's watching me, Lesterson,"
899,weighing me up. I can sense it. 
900,LESTERSON: Don't be a fool. 
901,"RESNO: I don't like it, I tell you. I don't know what these things can"
902,do. 
903,"LESTERSON: No, and we never shall know, shall we, unless we take film"
904,"of every reaction. Now get on with your work, man. "
905,"(Reluctantly, Resno returns to the camera. Suddenly, the Dalek's"
906,"gun-stick emits a blast of negative light. Resno crumples to the floor,"
907,the camera crashing down on top of him.) 
908,LESTERSON: Resno! 
909,(Lesterson disconnects the power.) 
910,"JANLEY: It's all right, he isn't dead. "
911,LESTERSON: What happened? 
912,JANLEY: Knocked out by the shock wave. 
913,LESTERSON: We must get him to the hospital. I'll go and get help. 
914,(Lesterson leaves. Janley kneels by Resno then reaches for a dust sheet
915,and starts to wrap the body.)

918,
919,"(The next morning, the Doctor stands at the window,"
920,deep in thought. He starts playing his recorder.) 
921,POLLY: But we've got to defend Quinn. 
922,"BEN: Yeah, I know. He's innocent until he's proved guilty. But he is"
923,guilty. 
924,POLLY: He's the Deputy Governor. 
925,BEN: So what? I had a headmaster once who got nicked for not paying his
926,bus fare. And then there's the motive. Don't forget the motive. 
927,"POLLY: Like what, for instance? "
928,"BEN: Well, he's the Deputy Governor, right? Maybe he wants to be"
929,Governor. 
930,"POLLY: Oh, that's ridiculous. "
931,"BEN: Well, the jacket button wasn't. And he was caught red-handed in"
932,the Communications room with a pair of pliers. And don't tell me he was
933,plucking his eye-brows either. 
934,"POLLY: Look, there are some people you know are all right. You just"
935,know by looking at them. 
936,BRAGEN: Good morning. The enquiry is about to begin. I've been sent to
937,escort you.

939,[Lesterson's laboratory]
940,
941,(Lesterson is preparing the Dalek for a
942,demonstration.) 
943,"LESTERSON: Hello, Janley. "
944,JANLEY: Is it time? 
945,"LESTERSON: Yes, yes, I think so. I feel quite excited. "
946,JANLEY: So you should. It's a wonderful achievement. 
947,"LESTERSON: Yes, yes, but the wonderful thing, Janley, is that we don't"
948,know the full scope of this experiment. Who knows where we may go from
949,here. Who know what this Dalek may do? 
950,JANLEY: It's harmless now? 
951,"LESTERSON: Yes, yes, yes. I've removed. Oh, Resno. Have you been to see"
952,him today? 
953,"JANLEY: Yes, yes. "
954,LESTERSON: And? 
955,JANLEY: He's had medical attention. He's going to be all right. 
956,LESTERSON: Oh good. 
957,JANLEY: No one must find out about this accident. It might give the
958,"Examiner just the excuse they want, and he could stop the whole"
959,project. 
960,"LESTERSON: Oh yes. Yes, yes, yes, you're right. "
961,JANLEY: Well. Ready? 
962,LESTERSON: Yes. Let's go and surprise them.

965,
966,"(The Doctor, Ben and Polly are shown in.) "
967,"HENSELL: I am sorry I couldn't see you earlier, Examiner. Please sit"
968,down. 
969,(Quinn is escorted in under guard.) 
970,"HENSELL: Well, Quinn, I don't like this any more than you do. What have"
971,you been up to? 
972,QUINN: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. 
973,"HENSELL: Well, what about Bragen's report then? These are facts, Quinn."
974,"Now, what have you got to say about it? "
975,QUINN: Does the engineer say I hit him? 
976,BRAGEN: How could he if he was hit from behind? 
977,QUINN: Then its only circumstantial evidence. 
978,BRAGEN: The Examiner was also attacked in the mercury swamp. We have a
979,button from your jacket found in the Examiner's hand. 
980,QUINN: I can't explain that. 
981,BRAGEN: I'm sure you can't. 
982,HENSELL: Examiner. You seem to be in two minds. 
983,"BEN: (sotto) Yeah, and two bodies. "
984,HENSELL: You mentioned to Bragen that these machines of Lesterson's.
985,What do you call them? 
986,"DOCTOR: I call them what they are, Daleks. "
987,"HENSELL: Yes, yes, yes, Daleks. You say they could be a motive for"
988,destroying our communications. 
989,DOCTOR: I do. 
990,(Lesterson enters.) 
991,"HENSELL: Lesterson, this is a special enquiry. Now please. "
992,LESTERSON: This won't wait. You won't be disappointed. 
993,"HENSELL: You heard what I said, Lesterson. "
994,"LESTERSON: Governor, I've just completed an experiment which could"
995,revolutionise the whole colony. Bear with me. 
996,"DOCTOR: Lesterson, what have you done? What have you done? "
997,"LESTERSON: I'll show you. Janley, now! "
998,(Lesterson's Dalek glides into the room. It's movement is strangely
999,"fascinating, holding everyone transfixed. Everyone except the Doctor"
1000,"who edges backwards, shaking his head in horror. The Dalek stops and"
1001,looks around at each person in turn. At last it re-focuses on the
1002,Doctor. The Doctor backs into a chair.) 
1003,BEN: It recognised the Doctor. It recognised him. 
1004,"POLLY: What's the matter, Doctor? Are you all right? "
1005,DOCTOR: The fools. The stupid fools. 
1006,BEN: You're scared. What can it do? 
1007,DOCTOR: Nothing yet. 
1008,"LESTERSON: This creation is called, I understand, a Dalek. "
1009,"BEN: It knew who you were. It sounds ridiculous, but it did. "
1010,DOCTOR: It knew who I was. 
1011,BEN: The Dalek knows who you are. 
1012,"LESTERSON: Now, look at it. I have merely given it electrical power,"
1013,"but it is capable of storing it. Moreover, it responds to orders. Turn"
1014,around. 
1015,(The Dalek obeys.) 
1016,LESTERSON: Move that chair. 
1017,(The Dalek pushes the chair across the room.) 
1018,"LESTERSON: Stop. You see? Well, just think what this could do for our"
1019,"mining program, our processing, packaging. Dozens of labour jobs,"
1020,Governor. It may even supply the end to all this Colony's problems. 
1021,"DOCTOR: Yes, it will end the colony's problems, because it will end the"
1022,colony. 
1023,DALEK: I am your servant. 
1024,"LESTERSON: It, it spoke! Janley, did you hear it? It can actually talk."
1025,
1026,"DOCTOR: It can do many things, Lesterson. But the thing it does most"
1027,"efficiently is exterminate human beings. It destroys them, without"
1028,"mercy, without conscience. It destroys them. Utterly. Completely. It"
1029,destroys them. 
1030,DALEK: (trying to drown out the Doctor) I am your servant. I am your
1031,servant. I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant. 
1032, Episode Three

1034, [Governor's office]
1035,
1036,"HENSELL: So, Lesterson, they're even capable of"
1037,speech. 
1038,"LESTERSON: Yes. But then, why not? After all, they have a certain"
1039,intelligence. 
1040,"HENSELL: Yes, I know, but "
1041,LESTERSON: But it is an intelligence that we can control. 
1042,HENSELL: So what you want is permission to continue your experiments? 
1043,"LESTERSON: Governor, think what it would mean if we were to set it to"
1044,work in the mines. It could double our production overnight. 
1045,BRAGEN: Consider the effects it could have on our whole economy. 
1046,"HENSELL: Yes, and the effect of that on Earth. Yes, yes, they could be"
1047,very grateful. 
1048,DOCTOR: (to Dalek) I shall stop you. I will. 
1049,"HENSELL: All right, Lesterson, permission granted. "
1050,DOCTOR: Permission? Permission for what? 
1051,"LESTERSON: To continue my work, Examiner. "
1052,"DOCTOR: But, but didn't you all hear what I said? The Daleks must be"
1053,destroyed! 
1054,LESTERSON: Never! 
1055,"DOCTOR: Very well. If not by my order, then by Earth's! Come Ben,"
1056,Polly. 
1057,"HENSELL: Ah, Examiner, just a moment. Tell me, why are you so against"
1058,this project? 
1059,"DOCTOR: But I've told you! I realise I can't give you any proof, but"
1060,you've no idea of the danger. 
1061,LESTERSON: No. 
1062,DOCTOR: Yes. Danger! I shall be contacting Earth just as soon as radio
1063,communications have been restored. 
1064,(The Doctor glares at the Dalek.) 
1065,"DOCTOR: You're my servant, are you? "
1066,DALEK: I am. 
1067,DOCTOR: Very well. Immobilise yourself. Go on. I order it! Immediately!
1068,
1069,(The Dalek's eye-stalk droops.) 
1070,DOCTOR: Huh! 
1071,(The Doctor leaves with Ben and Polly. The Dalek comes back to life.) 
1072,JANLEY: Lesterson. 
1073,LESTERSON: Why did you stop obeying? You were given an order. 
1074,DALEK: He has gone. 
1075,LESTERSON: Then you obey only 
1076,DALEK: His order was wrong. I cannot serve human beings if I am
1077,immobilised. You gave me power. Your orders are right. I serve you. 
1078,"HENSELL: Lesterson. Lesterson, it reasons. Just how limited is its"
1079,intelligence? 
1080,"LESTERSON: Now, there is no cause for concern, Governor. Just you wait"
1081,"until you see the amount of work it can do. And now, I'm really going"
1082,"to put you through your paces. Follow me, Dalek. "
1083,DALEK: I obey. 
1084,(The Dalek follows Lesterson and Janley.)
1085,
1086,[Corridor]
1087,
1088,DOCTOR: That's it! 
1089,POLLY: We should have stayed with Quinn. 
1090,"BEN: Well, we couldn't have helped him, Polly, even if we'd wanted to."
1091,The Governor's already reached his verdict. 
1092,DOCTOR: Wire. Scissors. Tape. 
1093,POLLY: But he didn't murder the real Examiner. I'm sure he didn't. 
1094,"BEN: Oh, well. The way I see it this lot's too busy arguing amongst"
1095,"themselves to do much about anything. Anyway, first things first. The"
1096,Daleks are the important thing. 
1097,"DOCTOR: Ah! Congratulations, Ben! "
1098,BEN: What did I do? What did I do? 
1099,"DOCTOR: You just used your brains, that's what you did. The Daleks are"
1100,the most important thing. 
1101,POLLY: I still think Quinn's innocent.
1102,
1103,[Governor's office]
1104,
1105,QUINN: How can I be in league with the rebels? 
1106,BRAGEN: The evidence confirms it. 
1107,QUINN: It was I that warned of their dangers. 
1108,BRAGEN: As part of your overall plan. 
1109,QUINN: You wouldn't even take the matter seriously. 
1110,"BRAGEN: If I was wrong then, I have a chance to rectify it now. "
1111,"QUINN: If that's going to be your attitude, I suggest that we "
1112,"HENSELL: Quinn! Let us conduct this inquiry in an orderly manner. Now,"
1113,the Examiner was attacked. There can be no question of that. 
1114,BRAGEN: And the button grabbed by the Examiner was missing from your
1115,suit. 
1116,"HENSELL: Yes, if you've got anything to add to that, you'd better say"
1117,it now. 
1118,QUINN: I didn't attack the man. I had no reason to. I was the one that
1119,sent for him. 
1120,HENSELL: You sent for him? 
1121,"QUINN: It was necessary. Under the circumstances, I'd hardly be likely"
1122,to sabotage the radio communications. 
1123,"HENSELL: But, but why Quinn? Why? "
1124,QUINN: Because of the rebels! 
1125,BRAGEN: The rebels. They're nothing more than one or two fanatics. 
1126,QUINN: You know as well as I do that they 
1127,BRAGEN: Unless you're trying to create trouble here to undermine the
1128,Governor's position. 
1129,"HENSELL: Bragen, you'd better explain that. "
1130,"BRAGEN: If you're removed, who takes your place? The Deputy Governor,"
1131,"of course. And that's the real reason behind all this trouble, isn't"
1132,"it, Quinn? "
1133,HENSELL: Go on. 
1134,BRAGEN: You attack the Examiner in the mercury swamp and blame it on
1135,the rebels. Then you sabotage the radio and blame that on the rebels
1136,too. 
1137,HENSELL: Get him out of my sight! 
1138,"QUINN: Hensell, before you listen to these preposterous allegations "
1139,(The guards drag Quinn out.) 
1140,"HENSELL: I chose Quinn myself. I trained him for the job. Why, in a few"
1141,"years time, he'd have had this seat. "
1142,"BRAGEN: Sometimes, Governor, a few years is a long time to wait. "
1143,"HENSELL: Oh, Bragen? "
1144,BRAGEN: Governor? 
1145,"HENSELL: You will assume Quinn's duties. As of now, you are Deputy"
1146,Governor. 
1147,[Guest quarters]
1148,
1149,(The Doctor uses a chair to smash the outer casing
1150,of a small electrical unit he's appropriated.) 
1151,BEN: I hope you know what you're doing. 
1152,DOCTOR: So do I. Excellent. excellent. 
1153,"BEN: I thought we were after the Daleks, not this control unit you've"
1154,nicked. 
1155,"DOCTOR: If only we could find a. Ah, yes. "
1156,"(Crossing to the bed, the Doctor pulls the mattress from the frame.) "
1157,"BEN: He's a right little delinquent, isn't he? "
1158,"POLLY: Doctor, what on Earth are you up to? "
1159,(The Doctor tugs at one of the metal cross straps on the bed frame
1160,until it comes loose.) 
1161,DOCTOR: Now we're really getting somewhere! 
1162,"BEN: Look Doctor, I don't want to appear dim, but how's this going to"
1163,do the Daleks in? 
1164,"DOCTOR: They think that Lesterson's the driving force, but I don't. The"
1165,Daleks are using him. 
1166,POLLY: But how? 
1167,"DOCTOR: Problem. Smash the Daleks, and the people here will lock us up"
1168,"or kill us. Let the Daleks go, and we'll all be exterminated. "
1169,BEN: We could just go back to the Tardis. At least we'd be safe to
1170,think there. 
1171,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, it's coming on. "
1172,"BEN: Oh, you talk to him, will you? "
1173,"POLLY: Doctor, look, if you told us what you were up to, perhaps we"
1174,could help you. 
1175,DOCTOR: Mustn't underestimate any of them. Lesterson's a first class
1176,"scientist, first class. He opened the capsule. He realised that the"
1177,Daleks could be reactivated. 
1178,"BEN: Yeah, that could be the answer. Let's kidnap Lesterson, and hide"
1179,"him away for a bit. Well, it would stop him bringing the Daleks back to"
1180,"life, wouldn't it? I thought it was pretty bright. "
1181,DOCTOR: There we are. 
1182,(The Doctor holds up the collection of parts he has assembled.) 
1183,BEN: What is it? 
1184,DOCTOR: What is it? It could be the answer to all our problems.
1185,
1186,[Corridor]
1187,
1188,"(The Doctor, Ben and Polly see Quinn being escorted"
1189,by a guard.) 
1190,"QUINN: Ah, Examiner, don't let them fool you about the rebels. They're"
1191,strong. Try and find out where they hold their meetings. 
1192,POLLY: Leave him alone! 
1193,"QUINN: It's all right, Polly. "
1194,"DOCTOR: We'll help him Polly, but later. "
1195,"POLLY: Yes, but "
1196,"DOCTOR: Now, this is a case where a little injustice is better than"
1197,wholesale slaughter. What we want is in Lesterson's laboratory. Come
1198,along. 
1199,[Lesterson's laboratory]
1200,
1201,LESTERSON: Incredible! Let's move on to test
1202,fourteen. 
1203,DALEK: I am ready. 
1204,"LESTERSON: When sodium acts on ethyl alcohol, what is the resulting"
1205,derivative? 
1206,DALEK: Sodium ethoxide. C2 H5 ONA. 
1207,"LESTERSON: Just five seconds, Janley. Just the time it took to speak"
1208,the answer. 
1209,JANLEY: It's right too. 
1210,"LESTERSON: But of course it's right. Look, can you imagine what kind of"
1211,"positronic brain this robot has, Janley? Think of the store of"
1212,knowledge that it must carry. Sulphuric acid. 
1213,DALEK: H2 SO4. 
1214,"LESTERSON: Ah, you see? "
1215,DOCTOR: May I come in? 
1216,LESTERSON: What do you want? 
1217,"DOCTOR: Oh, just to see how you're getting on. "
1218,LESTERSON: If you think 
1219,"DOCTOR: No, please. I'm not here to cause trouble. I'm just interested,"
1220,that's all. 
1221,LESTERSON: You've done nothing but meddle and interfere ever since you
1222,landed on Vulcan. 
1223,"DOCTOR: Well, I did give you permission to open up the capsule, now"
1224,"didn't I? Oh please, carry on. "
1225,LESTERSON: And you won't try to stop me? 
1226,"DOCTOR: Stop you? No, of course not. We got off on the wrong foot,"
1227,"Lesterson, but I'm a reasonable man, and I've been thinking perhaps I"
1228,was hasty. 
1229,"LESTERSON: Well, if you really want to call a truce. "
1230,"DOCTOR: A truce? My dear fellow, I'd like to be friends. "
1231,"LESTERSON: Yes. Yes, very well, you may stay. "
1232,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. Thank you. "
1233,(The Doctor hustles Ben and Polly out of the lab.) 
1234,DOCTOR: Perhaps you'd like to amuse yourselves for a little while. 
1235,"(On the other side of the room, Janley answers the communicator.) "
1236,JANLEY: Laboratory. Yes. All right. I can come now. Right. 
1237,(Janley picks up a cloth-wrapped bundle from the desk and conceals it
1238,behind her back.) 
1239,"JANLEY: I just have to slip out for a few minutes, Lesterson, all"
1240,right? 
1241,"LESTERSON: Ah, yes, yes. Very well then, Examiner, shall we test its"
1242,knowledge of physics? 
1243,"DOCTOR: Oh, splendid, splendid. Please, please, carry on. "
1244,LESTERSON: Thank you. What is the First Law of Thermodynamics? 
1245,DALEK: When heat is transformed into any other kind of energy or vice
1246,"versa, the total quantity of energy remains invariable. "
1247,"(As the Dalek gives the answer, the Doctor slips the modified control"
1248,unit from his pocket and connects it to the generator.) 
1249,"DALEK: That is to say, the quantity of heat which disappears is"
1250,equivalent to the quantity of other kind of energy produced. 
1251,(The Doctor activates his device and the Dalek begins to spin
1252,"helplessly, its eye and sucker sticks twitching uncontrollably.) "
1253,LESTERSON: You fool! What do you think you're doing? 
1254,DOCTOR: I'm saving your life! 
1255,(Lesterson smashes the control unit and pushes the Doctor towards the
1256,doors.) 
1257,LESTERSON: Get out! Get out! 
1258,DALEK: I have sustained no damage. 
1259,"(The Dalek swings round to watch the Doctor leave, the mechanism behind"
1260,its empty gun-socket clicking in useless frustration.)
1261,
1262,[Governor's office]
1263,
1264,JANLEY: It's all right. It's been done. 
1265,BRAGEN: You were able to get away then? 
1266,JANLEY: Yes. Lesterson's with the Examiner. And Hensell? 
1267,BRAGEN: At a meeting of production managers. He left me in control. 
1268,JANLEY: We could take over the colony now. 
1269,"BRAGEN: No. No, it has to be absolutely right. I don't want to take"
1270,"over a colony full of rebels do I, Janley? "
1271,JANLEY: I don't know. You're making me help them. 
1272,BRAGEN: Only to stir them up to create enough trouble to get rid of
1273,"Hensell, and then, then we crush them. The whole colony will be"
1274,"grateful, and I'll be Governor. "
1275,(Janley unwraps the bundle.) 
1276,BRAGEN: Is that the gun you told me of? Can you persuade the rebels
1277,this will help them? 
1278,"JANLEY: Yes, Valmar thinks he can work in a switch to turn it on and"
1279,off. 
1280,BRAGEN: How powerful is it? 
1281,"JANLEY: It killed Resno, Lesterson's assistant. Lesterson believes that"
1282,"Resno's simply shaken up, taking a few days off. "
1283,BRAGEN: And the body? 
1284,JANLEY: In the mercury swamp. Lesterson was the indirect cause of
1285,Resno's death. It's a good hold over him if he makes trouble. I'll give
1286,this to Valmar then? 
1287,BRAGEN: Yes. 
1288,JANLEY: When do we move? 
1289,BRAGEN: I need another card in my hand. The Examiner bothers me. 
1290,JANLEY: I thought Quinn was the danger. 
1291,"BRAGEN: Not any more. The Examiner's no fool. No, there has to be"
1292,something else.

1295,
1296,"(A little later, Ben and Polly are searching for"
1297,the Doctor.) 
1298,POLLY: Well? 
1299,"BEN: Well, he's not in the laboratory. Lesterson's by himself. "
1300,POLLY: Hmm. He must have gone another way. Can I leave it you? I'm
1301,going to go back to the rest room. 
1302,BEN: But 
1303,POLLY: Somebody's got to clear it up. 
1304,BEN: Okay. 
1305,(Ben leaves. Janley appears.) 
1306,JANLEY: Hello there. 
1307,POLLY: Hello. You're Lesterson's assistant aren't you? 
1308,"JANLEY: Yes. You're not looking for the Examiner, are you? "
1309,"POLLY: Well, do you know where he is? "
1310,"JANLEY: Yes, he's waiting to get a message through from Earth. He's in"
1311,the Communications room. 
1312,POLLY: Erm. 
1313,"JANLEY: Oh, you'll find it easy enough. Look. Around, then to your"
1314,"right, in the next block. "
1315,POLLY: Thanks very much. 
1316,(Janley follows Polly at a short distance.)
1317,
1318,[Communications room]
1319,
1320,POLLY: Doctor? Anyone here? 
1321,"(A technician looms from the shadows and grabs Polly, putting his hand"
1322,over her mouth.) 
1323,"JANLEY: Well done, Valmar. "
1324,(Janley breaks a phial into a handkerchief.) 
1325,JANLEY: Hold her. Hold her. 
1326,"(With the handkerchief over her nose and mouth, Polly sags unconscious"
1327,in Valmar's arms.) 
1328,"JANLEY: There, that'll keep her quiet for a bit. "
1329,VALMAR: I've no idea who she is. She was just snooping around. 
1330,JANLEY: I sent her. We want her kept out of the way. Get a couple of
1331,"your men to keep her in a safe place. Now, this is what I told you"
1332,about. 
1333,VALMAR: Yes. The lethal power must come from here. 
1334,JANLEY: Uh huh. 
1335,VALMAR: It should have quite a good range. 
1336,JANLEY: Can you fix it? 
1337,VALMAR: It's easy. This could win us the revolution. 
1338,[Guest quarters]
1339,
1340,"(The Doctor is stretched out on the bed, playing"
1341,his recorder.) 
1342,"BEN: She said she was coming back here. She knew the way, and she"
1343,wouldn't have wandered off. I know she wouldn't! Oh! 
1344,"DOCTOR: Ben, if you were a Dalek, what would be your next move? "
1345,BEN: I'm talking about Polly. 
1346,"DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no. She's a clever girl, but she couldn't"
1347,answer this. 
1348,BEN: But she is missing! 
1349,"DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no. "
1350,"BEN: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes! "
1351,"DOCTOR: No, no, no! She's looking around. There's a lot to see in the"
1352,colony. She's interested. I like that. 
1353,BEN: Come on. 
1354,DOCTOR: Where are we going? 
1355,"BEN: To report it. If we make a fool of ourselves, I don't care. We"
1356,report it!
1357,
1358,[Lesterson's laboratory]
1359,
1360,"LESTERSON: Yes, yes, yes. I managed to stop that"
1361,"fool of an Examiner just in time. You know, there are some people here"
1362,who believe that you're an enemy. 
1363,DALEK: I am your servant. What does this machine do? 
1364,"LESTERSON: You know, it's amazing. You have an almost human interest"
1365,and curiosity. 
1366,"DALEK: A Dalek is bet, is not the same as a human. If I am to help, I"
1367,must know everything. 
1368,"LESTERSON: Yes. Yes, of course. "
1369,DALEK: What is this machine? 
1370,LESTERSON: It computes meteorite storms as they approach our weather
1371,satellites. 
1372,DALEK: How accurate is it? 
1373,LESTERSON: About seventy percent. It helps to cut down on our satellite
1374,losses. 
1375,DALEK: Daleks can build computers with one hundred percent accuracy. 
1376,LESTERSON: One hundred percent? 
1377,"DALEK: If you provide materials and our own power unit, a computer will"
1378,be built. 
1379,LESTERSON: A hundred percent? But that would be an enormous saving for
1380,the for the colony. 
1381,DALEK: Then you will get the materials? 
1382,LESTERSON: I'll go and speak to the Governor at once. 
1383,DALEK: I will be ready to dictate the blueprint when you return. 
1384,"LESTERSON: Oh, that's marvellous. "
1385,(Lesterson leaves. The Dalek moves to the generator and adjusts a
1386,"control. As the power rises, the Dalek glides inside the capsule.)"
1387,
1388,[Corridor]
1389,
1390,(Ben realises the Doctor is lagging behind.) 
1391,BEN: You agreed we'd go and see Bragen. 
1392,DOCTOR: Hmm? Power. 
1393,BEN: Come on then! 
1394,DOCTOR: Now the energy intake for Daleks should be the cube 
1395,"(The Doctor rips a notice from the notice board, and starts scribbling"
1396,on the back.) 
1397,"DOCTOR: Now then, twenty two over three. Nineteen times "
1398,"BEN: Well, now what are you at? Talk to yourself. "
1399,"DOCTOR: Oh, it's useless with incomplete data! "
1400,(The Doctor smoothes the notice flat again and pins it back on the
1401,board. Then he ducks out of sight.) 
1402,DOCTOR: Lesterson! 
1403,BEN: Eh? 
1404,DOCTOR: He just went past. That means we can get into his laboratory
1405,again. 
1406,BEN: But we're looking for

1410,
1411,(The Doctor sees a thick cable stretching from the
1412,power unit into the capsule.) 
1413,BEN: There's somebody in there. 
1414,DALEK: What are you doing here? 
1415,DOCTOR: Stand aside. Servants shouldn't question. 
1416,DALEK: Entry is restricted. 
1417,DOCTOR: Not for me it isn't. Accord every access. I've got a badge. 
1418,DALEK: That is an order. 
1419,"DOCTOR: A Dalek order. Short circuit the generator, Ben. "
1420,DALEK: Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Stand back! 
1421,"DOCTOR: Don't be frightened of it, Ben. It's not armed. I'm going to"
1422,see what it was doing in there. 
1423,(The Doctor stops as two armed Daleks glide from the capsule.) 
1424,DOCTOR: Ben? 
1425,BEN: What? 
1426,DOCTOR: Let's get out of here. 
1427,BEN: The fool. Lesterson must have reactivated them. 
1428,"DOCTOR: Yes. When I say run, run like a rabbit. Run! "
1429,(The Doctor and Ben dash the lab.) 
1430,DALEK: I have sent the human being for materials. 
1431,DALEK 2: And power? 
1432,DALEK: Yes. Power we can turn into static. Then we will conquer. 
1433,DALEKS: We will conquer. We will conquer. We will conquer. 
1434,[Governor's office]
1435,
1436,"DOCTOR: But if you didn't do it, Lesterson, then"
1437,the Dalek must have used your power supply and reactivated the others
1438,itself. 
1439,LESTERSON: I was going to do that anyway. 
1440,"BEN: Are you off your head, mate? Those two are armed! "
1441,"LESTERSON: Then we turn off the electricity, disarm them, and then"
1442,everything is safe again. 
1443,DOCTOR: But I've already explained to you. 
1444,"HENSELL: Stop these arguments, both of you. I've had enough. I've every"
1445,confidence in Lesterson. He has carte blanche for the Daleks from now
1446,on. 
1447,DOCTOR: But they must be destroyed! 
1448,"HENSELL: Bragen, I'm making a tour of the perimeter. I put you in"
1449,"direct charge here. See that Lesterson gets everything he wants, will"
1450,you? 
1451,(Hensell leaves.) 
1452,"LESTERSON: I shall need a permanent guard on my laboratory, Bragen. "
1453,DOCTOR: Huh. 
1454,"(The Doctor leaves, followed by Ben.) "
1455,BRAGEN: Don't worry about the Examiner. I think I can keep him quiet.
1456,
1457,[Guest quarters]
1458,
1459,BEN: We've been forgetting about Polly. 
1460,"DOCTOR: Greed and ambition, that's all it is. Wait till they find out"
1461,what their precious production figures have cost them! 
1462,(Bragen enters.) 
1463,"BEN: Oh, I want to see you. "
1464,BRAGEN: What about? 
1465,"BEN: Well it's Polly, she's missing. We can't find her anywhere. "
1466,(The Doctor starts playing his recorder.) 
1467,BRAGEN: I'll tell one of my men to make enquiries. It shouldn't take
1468,long to find her. 
1469,"BEN: Ah, thanks. "
1470,"BRAGEN: Examiner, some of my men have found a body in the mercury"
1471,swamp. It was the body of a middle-aged man. 
1472,DOCTOR: What is that to do with me? 
1473,BRAGEN: You're the Examiner. Or maybe you're not. 
1474,DOCTOR: Just exactly what do you mean by that? 
1475,BRAGEN: Who are you? Quinn's friends come to stir up rebellion? 
1476,DOCTOR: There's only one possible way that you could know I'm not the
1477,Examiner. 
1478,"BEN: Yeah, by knowing what the real Examiner looked like. "
1479,"DOCTOR: Exactly, Ben. Exactly! Only two people knew of his arrival on"
1480,this planet. Myself and his murderer. 
1481,BRAGEN: That's enough! 
1482,"BEN: Is it? Doctor, we've got to tell the Governor. "
1483,BRAGEN: Do you think he'll believe you? I'll soon convince him that you
1484,murdered the man yourself. You stole the Examiner's badge. 
1485,DOCTOR: Then why don't you arrest us? Because there's a doubt isn't
1486,"there? Because it might, it just might, go against you. "
1487,"BRAGEN: All right, all right, so neither of us wants to make a move."
1488,But you leave Lesterson alone. And the Daleks! 
1489,(Bragen leaves.) 
1490,"BEN: He'd make a right Father Christmas, wouldn't he? "
1491,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'd rather fight a hundred of his sort than just one Dalek."
1492,
1493,(An envelope is pushed under the door. Ben opens the door but the
1494,corridor is empty. Ben picks up the letter.) 
1495,BEN: Listen to this. The girl is safe. She will remain so as long as
1496,you leave the Daleks alone.

1498,[Lesterson's laboratory]
1499,
1500,(Two gun-sticks are on the bench.) 
1501,LESTERSON: And did you disarm the other two? 
1502,DALEK: Yes. We are your servants. We do not need guns. 
1503,LESTERSON: I'm very glad. I knew the Examiner was wrong about you. 
1504,DALEK: Did you get our materials? 
1505,LESTERSON: Yes. Everything you need you can have. 
1506,DALEK: And a power plant? 
1507,LESTERSON: Everything. 
1508,"(The other two Daleks emerge from the capsule, both disarmed.) "
1509,DALEK: We will get our power. 
1510,DALEKS: We will get our power. We will get our power. We will get our

1516,"(As the Daleks close in, Lesterson goes to the"
1517,"generator and cuts the power supply. Instantly, the Daleks movements"
1518,become sluggish.) 
1519,DALEK: (slow) Turn back the power supply. 
1520,"LESTERSON: I will, I will. But I want you to remember that I control"
1521,you. 
1522,DALEK: We are your servants. 
1523,LESTERSON: I know. Remember it. I gave you each a special charge to
1524,bring you back to life. Any further power you need must come from this
1525,"generator, and I control it. Is that clear? "
1526,DALEK: We obey. 
1527,(Lesterson returns the generator to full power. Two of the Daleks
1528,return to the capsule.) 
1529,LESTERSON: Where are they going? 
1530,"DALEK: To await your orders, master. "
1531,LESTERSON: Good. Have you completed the blueprints for the meteor storm
1532,computer? 
1533,DALEK: It is ready.

1543,VALMAR: Nearly. This is Valmar. Test call please. 
1544,(The communicator buzzes.) 
1545,"VALMAR: Terrace. So I can hear you clearly all right, good. Now try and"
1546,"get in connection now with the interior, and then the perimeter"
1547,"stations. Well, no troubles now. "
1548,BRAGEN: About time. This work should have been completed long before
1549,this. 
1550,"VALMAR: Well, I did the best I could. "
1551,"BRAGEN: Well, it isn't good enough. "
1552,"VALMAR: Then get someone else, Bragen. "
1553,"BRAGEN: Be careful. I shall be watching you, Valmar, after this. Now"
1554,get out. 
1555,(There's a commotion outside.) 
1556,BEN : See Bragen. 
1557,DOCTOR : Accord every access. 
1558,BRAGEN: What does this intrusion mean? 
1559,"GUARD: I'm sorry, Bragen. I tried to stop them. "
1560,DOCTOR: Intrusion? It's no intrusion. We're just returning the various
1561,calls that you made. This guard tried to tell us you were busy. You're
1562,"not a bit, are you? "
1563,"BRAGEN: All right, I'll see them. "
1564,"DOCTOR: Oh, what a nice new uniform. Very smart, very smart. I would"
1565,like a hat like that. 
1566,"BRAGEN: Well, what do you want? "
1567,BEN: Some joker has kidnapped Polly and sent us this note. 
1568,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1569,"BEN: Well, we want to know what you're doing to find her. "
1570,BRAGEN: Now that the communications are restored we can start a search.
1571,
1572,"BEN: Yeah, I can just imagine what kind of job you'll make of that."

1574,BRAGEN: The planet is a large one. 
1575,"(A Dalek enters, carrying a drink on a tray.) "
1576,"DOCTOR: So, they've given you the run of the colony, have they? "
1577,DALEK: We obey. 
1578,(The Doctor picks up a chair as if to defend himself.) 
1579,DALEK: Do I bring liquid for your visitors? 
1580,BRAGEN: No. They won't be staying much longer. 
1581,(The Dalek leaves.) 
1582,"BEN: Look, Doctor, if he's not going to help us, we'll have to search"
1583,for Polly ourselves. 
1584,"BRAGEN: Sound advice. Why don't you, Doctor? "
1585,"DOCTOR: Uh, uh. Examiner. I wonder how much longer they'll be able to"
1586,move around on these floors?

1588,DOCTOR: The floors. They're not metal. 
1589,BEN: Doctor.

1591,on.)

1595,full schedule.

1600,"BRAGEN: Yes, sir. "
1601,"HENSELL : All right. Well, you can reach me here if you"
1602,"have to, that's all. "
1603,"BRAGEN: One moment, Governor. When will you be coming back? "
1604,"HENSELL : Oh, not for a day or two at least. You can"
1605,"manage, can't you? "
1606,"BRAGEN: Yes. Yes, of course, Governor. "

1621,BEN: Doctor. Why should he? 
1622,(Three Daleks go past.) 
1623,DOCTOR: It's madness! 
1624,BEN: What is? 
1625,DOCTOR: Letting them run around like this. 
1626,"BEN: Hey, wait a minute. Bragen had one acting as a servant, and we've"
1627,just left him. 
1628,DOCTOR: One Dalek in Bragen's office. Three Daleks just gone down the
1629,corridors. That makes four. 
1630,BEN: Where did the fourth one come from? 
1631,"DOCTOR: Well, Lesterson can't have been making them. Perhaps there were"
1632,more in the capsule than we thought. 
1633,"BEN: We must go and see Lesterson. Yeah, and show him this note. Maybe"
1634,he or Janley knows where Polly is. 
1635,(The Doctor gazes at the notice board. Kebble comes back then turns
1636,away again when he sees Ben.)

1638,notice board is?

1646,LESTERSON: Janley? 
1647,JANLEY: What is it? 
1648,LESTERSON: The Daleks. They've given me another list of materials they
1649,need. 
1650,JANLEY: Let me see. We've got all those things? 
1651,"LESTERSON: Yes, but why these quantities, Janley? Why? How can they"
1652,"have used up all the materials I gave them? What is it? Why, it's only"
1653,a matter of a few hours ago. 
1654,JANLEY: They're building new things for us. 
1655,"LESTERSON: Yes, well, I don't want them to do anything without"
1656,consulting me. What is it they do inside there? 
1657,JANLEY: You're worrying too much. 
1658,"LESTERSON: Look, Janley, say what you like, but I'm beginning to"
1659,believe that the Examiner is right about the Daleks. Their original
1660,"thinking terrifies me. If we can control them, fine. But if not "
1661,JANLEY: Yes? 
1662,LESTERSON: Then I shall have them destroyed. It's too dangerous. The
1663,Examiner knows something about them that we don't. I'm going to ask his
1664,advice. 
1665,JANLEY: I wouldn't bring the Examiner into it if I were you. 
1666,LESTERSON: And why not? 
1667,JANLEY: You want him to find out about Resno? 
1668,"LESTERSON: Oh, a little accident. How is he? Is he better? "
1669,JANLEY: He's dead. 
1670,LESTERSON: What are you talking about? You told me he was 
1671,JANLEY: You were busy with the experiments on the Daleks. 
1672,LESTERSON: But you should have told me. But the body? It'll have to be
1673,reported. 
1674,"JANLEY: Don't worry, no one will find the body. "
1675,"LESTERSON: Oh, Janley, you've done a terrible thing. "
1676,JANLEY: The experiments on the Daleks were more important. 
1677,"LESTERSON: More important than human life? No, no, I won't accept that."
1678,
1679,JANLEY: You will. You must. Your carelessness was the cause of Resno's
1680,death. You murdered him. It's only your word against mine. 
1681,LESTERSON: I won't be blackmailed by you. 
1682,JANLEY: All I want is for you to go on as you are. Scientific discovery
1683,"can't stop dead, Lesterson. "

1686,"DOCTOR: Accord every access, remember? "
1687,BEN: We're looking for Polly. 
1688,"LESTERSON: Well, she isn't here, and I haven't seen her. "
1689,"BEN: Well, she's been kidnapped. "
1690,"LESTERSON: Oh, it sounds a little unlikely. "
1691,"BEN: Oh, it does, does it? Well, we've got this note which tells us so."
1692,
1693,"LESTERSON: I'm very sorry, but I don't know anything about it. "
1694,DOCTOR: Lesterson? 
1695,LESTERSON: Yes? 
1696,"DOCTOR: You haven't been building Daleks, have you? "
1697,"LESTERSON: Building? No, I wouldn't know how to begin. "
1698,DOCTOR: And there were only three in the capsule? 
1699,LESTERSON: Yes. 
1700,"DOCTOR: Well, we've just seen four. One in the Governor's office and"
1701,three in the corridor. 
1702,LESTERSON: But that's not possible! 
1703,DOCTOR: There's only one explanation. The Daleks are reproducing
1704,themselves. 
1705,JANLEY: These things are machines. How could they reproduce? 
1706,DOCTOR: Machines? What makes you think they're just machines? The
1707,Daleks are brilliant engineers. Nothing is beyond them given the right
1708,materials. 
1709,LESTERSON: What? 
1710,DOCTOR: I said nothing is beyond them given the right materials. 
1711,LESTERSON: Oh. 
1712,"DOCTOR: Lesterson, what's the matter? "
1713,LESTERSON: Oh. 
1714,"JANLEY: Leave him alone. He's just been overworking, that's all. "
1715,"BEN: Well, he looks bad. "
1716,"JANLEY: Will you both go away. Guard! It's you, badgering him with"
1717,questions. You've done nothing but hound him ever since you arrived on
1718,Vulcan. Bragen's orders were that no one was to be admitted. 
1719,"GUARD: Yes, but I thought that the Examiner. "
1720,JANLEY: He attacked Lesterson. Get them out of here. Both of them. 
1721,BEN: He did not attack Lesterson! 
1722,"JANLEY: Out, do you hear? "
1723,"BEN: All right, all right. "
1724,(The guard leads the Doctor and Ben out. Janley uses the communications
1725,unit.) 
1726,JANLEY: Janley here. Tell Valmar to come over to the lab right away.
1727,"Good. Now, it's all right. Come on. Rest here for a bit. There. You've"
1728,been doing far too much. 
1729,(Janley gives Lesterson a glass of water.) 
1730,JANLEY: Shh. 
1731,"(When Valmar arrives, Lesterson is fast asleep.) "
1732,JANLEY: I've sedated him. 
1733,"VALMAR: Well, what's the matter with him? "
1734,"JANLEY: Overwork, I suppose. He just suddenly broke up. Anyway, it'll"
1735,give you a chance to lay in the new power cable the Daleks have asked
1736,for. 
1737,"VALMAR: You don't miss a trick, do you? "
1738,(Janley goes to the Dalek capsule.) 
1739,JANLEY: We're going to lay in the new cables you wanted. 
1740,DALEK: Good. 
1741,"VALMAR: You're sure this is okay, Janley? "
1742,"JANLEY: Of course. We help them, they help us. "
1743,DALEK: Yes. We are your servants. 
1744,"JANLEY: Don't take too long about it, Valmar. Oh, you saw the notice,"
1745,did you? 
1746,VALMAR: I saw it. 
1747,[Corridor]
1748,
1749,(Back at the notice board.) 
1750,"BEN: Well, we're still no nearer finding Polly. What are we hanging"
1751,about here for? 
1752,"DOCTOR: Ben, I've found a message in code. It's an anagram, you just"
1753,"take the capital letters, see? Work it out yourself. "
1754,"BEN: Oh, I can't do crosswords. "
1755,"DOCTOR: Meeting tonight, 2000 hours. R O C K E T -- Rocket. R O O M -"
1756,Room. P. Rocket Room P. 
1757,(The Doctor lets a Dalek go past.) 
1758,DOCTOR: It's the rebel's way of calling a meeting. Only tonight we're
1759,"going to be there, early. "
1760,"BEN: Yeah, maybe we're nearer finding Polly than I thought."
1761,
1762,[Rocket room P]
1763,
1764,"(Later, the Doctor and Ben are hiding behind a pile"
1765,of boxes.) 
1766,BEN: Ow. I've got pins and needles now. 
1767,DOCTOR: What's the time? 
1768,BEN: Time we went home. 
1769,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1770,"(The rebels start filing into the room, taking their places around a"
1771,large table. Valmar brings a Dalek in. Janley has a Dalek gun-stick
1772,attached to a control box. Valmar fastens the gun-stick to the Dalek. )
1773,
1774,"JANLEY: Now, we're going to demonstrate something. You section leaders"
1775,"can pass on what you've seen. So far, we've been concerned with testing"
1776,the strength of the Governor with a few acts of sabotage. But now we're
1777,ready to take over. 
1778,"KEBBLE: What is that thing? I've seen them moving about, but all we've"
1779,been told is that it's a machine Lesterson discovered. 
1780,JANLEY: Valmar. 
1781,VALMAR: Lesterson removed the armaments of the Daleks he discovered.
1782,"I've rearmed this one, but with a controlling device. We can regulate"
1783,the fire power and turn it off and on whenever we choose. 
1784,JANLEY: Shall we have the demonstration now? 
1785,(A shadowy figure nods.) 
1786,BEN: That's the one we want. He must be the boss of this outfit. 
1787,"JANLEY: This screen is two inch thick tungsten steel. Right, Valmar. "
1788,VALMAR: Fire at the screen. 
1789,(The metal screen is totally destroyed. Consternation.) 
1790,JANLEY: Quiet! You must keep quiet. We're too vulnerable here. 
1791,KEBBLE: But you can't control a thing like that. It'll turn on us. 
1792,"JANLEY: No, it won't. "
1793,KEBBLE: I wouldn't let any of my group go anywhere near it. 
1794,VALMAR: I can control it. 
1795,"KEBBLE: Prove it. Ah, you daren't! I'm not talking about that thing"
1796,firing at the wall or bits of metal or anything. I mean people. Have
1797,you tested whether you can stop it from killing people? Our people? 
1798,"VALMAR: Look, I can show you what I've done here. "
1799,KEBBLE: Forget it. How do you know a Dalek can tell the difference
1800,between the Governor's people and our people? 
1801,"VALMAR: But I can tell the difference, you fool, and I control it. "
1802,KEBBLE: We want something better than words. 
1803,JANLEY: Test it on me. Will that satisfy you? 
1804,"KEBBLE: Well yes, but "
1805,BEN: She's out of her mind. 
1806,(Valmar looks at the man in the shadows.) 
1807,VALMAR: Is it all right? 
1808,(The man agrees. Janley stands in front of the Dalek.) 
1809,"VALMAR: Now, when I tell you to fire "
1810,DALEK: I am your servant. 
1811,"(Valmar flicks a switch, and taps the Dalek on its dome. The weapon"
1812,does no damage.) 
1813,JANLEY: Get back to your places. 
1814,KEBBLE: Are you all right? 
1815,JANLEY: Of course. I don't take needless risks. 
1816,"VALMAR: Oh, well done, Janley. "
1817,"JANLEY: You haven't disarmed the Dalek. Well, go on, take the gun away."
1818,"We don't want any accidents. Now, what about the girl? "
1819,KEBBLE: We've got her safely locked up. Never fear. 
1820,JANLEY: I think the best thing for us to do is 
1821,BEN: Hear that? Maybe they'll say were she is. 
1822,(Ben sends a box crashing to the floor.) 
1823,JANLEY: Who's there? 
1824,"BEN: You stay there, I'll distract them. Find out where Polly is. "
1825,JANLEY: No! 
1826,BEN: Help! Help! 
1827,(Ben runs out and Kebble grabs him and knocks him out.) 
1828,JANLEY: The guards will have heard that! Come on we've got to get out
1829,of here! Take him and lock him up! Quick! Out! 
1830,"(Kebble and another man drag Ben away. Janley and the rebels follow,"
1831,leaving the leader and the Dalek in the room.) 
1832,BRAGEN: You might as well come out. We know you're there. 
1833,(The Dalek goes to the Doctor's hiding place.) 
1834,DOCTOR: Bragen. 
1835,BRAGEN: Of course. Who else is fitted to be leader of the rebels? 
1836,DOCTOR: No doubt you want to be leader of the Daleks too. 
1837,BRAGEN: I am the leader of the Daleks. 
1838,"DOCTOR: Well, see if you can stop this one from killing me. "
1839,"BRAGEN: Stop! You heard me, that's an order. Turn away. Fetch the"
1840,guard. 
1841,(The Dalek hesitates.) 
1842,DALEK: I obey. 
1843,"DOCTOR: You hope to have it both ways, Bragen. But how will you look in"
1844,"front of the Governor, when I explain your dual role to him? "
1845,BRAGEN: The Governor will hardly listen to an impostor. 
1846,DOCTOR: An impostor? How do you propose to prove that? 
1847,BRAGEN: My guards are now going to produce the body of the real
1848,Examiner from the mercury swamp. 
1849,DOCTOR: The one you murdered. 
1850,BRAGEN: The one you pretended to be. 
1851,DOCTOR: Murder's a far worse crime than impersonation. 
1852,"BRAGEN: Yes, but you can't prove I'm a murderer, while I can prove that"
1853,you're an impostor. 
1854,(The Dalek returns with Janley and two guards.) 
1855,BRAGEN: Take this man away. Detain him. 
1856,(The guards escort the Doctor out.) 
1857,JANLEY: A dangerous man. 
1858,BRAGEN: Now the only one left is the Governor. 
1859,JANLEY: Perhaps we should have dealt with the Examiner earlier. 
1860,"BRAGEN: I'll deal with him in time, and Quinn."
1861,
1862,[Cell block]
1863,
1864,(A guard uses a sonic key to open the cell next to
1865,"Quinn, put the Doctor inside and relock it. The guards leave.) "
1866,QUINN: You're the last man I expected to see here. 
1867,"DOCTOR: Hmm. Works by sound, does it? "
1868,"QUINN: I'm speaking to you, Examiner. "
1869,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sorry. "
1870,"QUINN: If you'd listened to me in the first place, you wouldn't be"
1871,locked up here now. 
1872,"DOCTOR: Well, your imprisonment hasn't been entirely wasted. It's"
1873,brought your enemy out into the open. 
1874,QUINN: Bragen? I've known that all along. 
1875,DOCTOR: Yes. But did you know that he was the leader of the rebels? 
1876,"QUINN: Bragen, the leader? "
1877,"DOCTOR: Yes. It's quite a simple sort of lock, really. "
1878,(The Doctor empties his pockets.) 
1879,QUINN: Hensell's trouble is he thinks he can run this colony on his
1880,personality alone. 
1881,"DOCTOR: But even if he knew of the danger, could he do anything? The"
1882,rebels are well organised. 
1883,QUINN: The Governor's popular. He can count on the mine workers at the
1884,perimeter for support. 
1885,DOCTOR: In that case we must get word to him. 
1886,"QUINN: If you'd done your job properly, Examiner, you wouldn't be here"
1887,"now, and I'd have been out too. "
1888,"DOCTOR: Ah yes, but then I'm not the real Examiner. "
1889,(The Doctor chooses a dog whistle from his collection.) 
1890,"DOCTOR: Ben, Polly and I, we're just travellers, that's all. I found"
1891,the Examiner dead. Bragen murdered him. 
1892,(The Doctor blows the high pitched whistle at the lock.) 
1893,QUINN: Everything leads back friend Bragen. Just give me a chance get
1894,my hands on him. 
1895,DOCTOR: We aren't going to have that chance unless we can get out of
1896,here. 
1897,QUINN: There's just a little matter of the cell doors. 
1898,"(The doors don't open, but a dog starts barking outside.)"

1901,
1902,(Lesterson wakes. He gets a wet handkerchief and
1903,presses it to his face. A Dalek enters and he hides. It goes to the
1904,capsule and another Dalek comes out.) 
1905,DALEK 2: You sent for me? 
1906,DALEK: Take up a position at the communications room. Watch and report.
1907,
1908,DALEK 2: I obey. 
1909,"LESTERSON: They're conspiring together! Oh, why didn't I realise? The"
1910,Examiner was right. They are evil! 
1911,(Two more Daleks come out of the capsule and all three leave.) 
1912,LESTERSON: There are four. They can't be reproducing!

1914,
1915,(Lesterson discovers a new section has been opened
1916,"up, A corridor slopes down and away round a corner. Mechanical sounds"
1917,echo from below. Lesterson goes through two doors to a small ante-room.
1918,Through a glass wall he sees a huge chamber with a long production
1919,"line. At the far end, the lower half of a Dalek appears on the conveyor"
1920,belt. It goes under an archway where mechanical arms reach in to do
1921,something then pull back. Then the casing is steam-cleaned and
1922,"smothered in foam. Further along the belt it stops by a tank, where"
1923,another Dalek nets a green tentacled creature and puts it into the
1924,casing where probes insert themselves into its body. Under a second
1925,"archway, the Dalek receives it's dome. A final spray, and the machine"
1926,comes to life. It leaves the conveyor belt for it's final check as
1927,another lower case has started it's journey at the far end.)

1956,JANLEY: What? What are you talking about?

2022,fix up the new Dalek power cable. 
2023,KEBBLE: Right. 
2024,DALEK: When will the work be completed? 
2025,"JANLEY: What is this cable you Daleks are laying, anyway? "
2026,DALEK: Daleks operate on static electricity. 
2027,JANLEY: Static! Is that possible? 
2028,"DALEK: To create static, the Daleks need a complete cable circuit. "
2029,JANLEY: I see. You convert our electricity into your own power. 
2030,DALEK: That is correct. When will the human being complete the work? 
2031,JANLEY: He'll be here. It's easier now. There's no-one to interfere
2032,with our plans.

2039,foolproof. 
2040,DOCTOR: I wonder how they're converting the power? 
2041,QUINN: What are you talking about? 
2042,DOCTOR: The Daleks. They're powered by static electricity. It's like
2043,"blood to them, a constant life-stream. "
2044,QUINN: Static isn't workable. 
2045,"DOCTOR: It is to the Daleks. They've conquered static, just as they've"
2046,conquered anti-magnetics. 
2047,QUINN: I'm not going to listen to any more of this nonsense.

2060,LESTERSON: Oh! Oh! Oh! 
2061,"DOCTOR: I say. I say, do you think we might have a little more water? "

2121,power connector. A Dalek is watching them.) 
2122,VALMAR: Pass me that small screwdriver. 
2123,"POLLY: I can't. My hands are tied. Anyway, I wouldn't help you even if"
2124,I could. 
2125,VALMAR: Okay. 
2126,(Kebble appears with more cable.) 
2127,VALMAR: More? I can't handle them. 
2128,KEBBLE: This is the lot. 
2129,POLLY: Listen. The Dalek's gone now. 
2130,KEBBLE: That doesn't mean you can start talking. 
2131,"VALMAR: Oh, leave her alone, Kebble. She isn't doing any harm. "
2132,"POLLY: You think you're very tough don't you, pushing a girl around."
2133,I'd like to see you come up against a real man. 
2134,KEBBLE: Like who? 
2135,"POLLY: Like Ben, for instance. "
2136,KEBBLE: Don't worry about him. We've got him safely stowed away. 
2137,POLLY: You've got Ben? 
2138,KEBBLE: He's sleeping off a slight fall. 
2139,VALMAR: I told you to leave her alone. 
2140,"POLLY: Your name's Valmar, isn't it? "
2141,VALMAR: That's it. 
2142,POLLY: You want the Daleks to fight the Governor. But don't you see?
2143,"They'll turn on you, too. "
2144,KEBBLE: What? Three big pepper pots? 
2145,VALMAR: One of them did kill Resno. And you saw what the Dalek did to
2146,that sheet of metal. 
2147,POLLY: And that's just the beginning. 
2148,KEBBLE: Don't listen to her. She's giving you the Examiner's line. 
2149,"POLLY: He isn't the Examiner. We're just travellers, landed here by"
2150,"accident. The Doctor, that's the man you think is the Examiner, found"
2151,the real Examiner dead and picked up his papers. 
2152,VALMAR: This Doctor of yours. He knows something about the Daleks? 
2153,POLLY: He's tried to warn everyone. It's the only reason we stayed
2154,here. 
2155,DALEK: When will the work be completed? 
2156,VALMAR: I don't know. I'll need a new junction box like this one. 
2157,(The Dalek leaves.) 
2158,POLLY: You've all underestimated these Daleks. 
2159,"KEBBLE: Better brains than us, I suppose. "
2160,POLLY: I only know what the Doctor has told me. He says they're capable
2161,of exterminating whole nations. 
2162,"VALMAR: Perhaps, but what would they want to kill us for, after we've"
2163,taken over. We're friendly with the Daleks. 
2164,POLLY: But don't you see? Human beings can't be friends with Daleks.
2165,They don't have friends. 
2166,VALMAR: I don't see why not. 
2167,POLLY: It's a kind of hatred for anything unlike themselves. They think
2168,they're superior. 
2169,VALMAR: The girl's got something. 
2170,"KEBBLE: You want to tell Janley, you're welcome. "
2171,"POLLY: Janley! She'll betray the lot of you, if she gets the chance. "
2172,DALEK: The other junction box is outside. 
2173,VALMAR: Thank you. 
2174,"KEBBLE: Talk too much, don't you? Didn't you know he was soft on"

2215,BRAGEN: One moment. 
2216,"HENSELL: I asked you a question, man. "

2218,"HENSELL: Look, your work can wait. You can hand over to me tomorrow. I"
2219,want to hear about the Examiner. 
2220,BRAGEN: The Examiner is at present in jail. 
2221,"HENSELL: In jail? That's rather dangerous, isn't it? Who put him there?"
2222,
2223,BRAGEN: I did. 
2224,"HENSELL: You did? In heaven's sake, why? "
2225,"BRAGEN: He's an impostor, Governor. Possibly a murderer as well. We've"
2226,just discovered the body of the real Examiner in the mercury swamp. 
2227,"HENSELL: I hope you're sure of your facts, Bragen. "
2228,BRAGEN: Quite sure. 
2229,HENSELL: This could have far reaching consequences. 
2230,"BRAGEN: As far as I am concerned, there's nothing more to be said. So"
2231,if there's nothing further 
2232,HENSELL: Nothing further? Who the devil do you think you're talking to?
2233,"Stand up when you're speaking to me, man! "
2234,BRAGEN: I prefer to remain seated. 
2235,HENSELL: Do you now? We'll soon see about that. Guards! Take this man
2236,out of my office. Did you hear what I said? That's an order! 
2237,"BRAGEN: You forget, my dear Hensell. They're not your guards, they're"
2238,mine. 
2239,HENSELL: I am the Governor. 
2240,BRAGEN: No. Not now. I am. 
2241,"HENSELL: Oh, I see. Your guards, ay? Yes, Quinn warned me about your"
2242,"guards, but we all took them too lightly, didn't we? But we'll soon"
2243,change that. 
2244,"(Hensell moves to the door, but guards block his way.) "
2245,HENSELL: You imbecile! How long do you think your handful of guards can
2246,hang out when the people hear that I am being kept a prisoner in my own
2247,capital? 
2248,"BRAGEN: The people will do exactly as they are told, Hensell. It will,"
2249,"of course, be easier for them if you co-operate with us. "
2250,"(Bragen pushes a button on the desk, then motions for Hensell to take"

2254,"HENSELL: So, Bragen, you want my cooperation, do you? "
2255,BRAGEN: It would save bloodshed. I might even let you keep the title of
2256,Governor. 
2257,HENSELL: Might you now? I'll tell you what you will do. You'll order
2258,your guards to disarm and place yourself under arrest immediately! 
2259,BRAGEN: So you reject my offer. I thought it a generous one in the
2260,circumstances. 
2261,HENSELL: What circumstances? 
2262,BRAGEN: Look at this. 
2263,HENSELL: What is it? 
2264,(Bragen unwraps a Dalek gun-stick.) 
2265,BRAGEN: The reason that the colony is now mine. 
2266,(Bragen attaches the gun-stick to the Dalek.) 
2267,HENSELL: Is it a weapon of some kind? 
2268,BRAGEN: I'll arrange a demonstration for you. Do you still refuse my
2269,offer? 
2270,HENSELL: I will not be intimidated.

2554,to get back to Lesterson's lab. 
2555,(Kebble appears in the doorway and is shot in the back by a Dalek. The
2556,Doctor gets through the window just as a Dalek enters.)
2557,
2558,[Governor's office]
2559,
2560,BRAGEN: This is Governor Bragen speaking. A group
2561,of rebels is attempting to take over the colony. It is the duty of all
2562,loyal citizens to help the guards resist. Stay in your homes. Order
2563,will be restored. Listen to my bulletins. 
2564,GUARD: The rebels are using the Daleks against our people! 
2565,"BRAGEN: Well, get back and fight! Why do you come running to me? What"
2566,do you think your guns are for? 
2567,"GUARD: Well, the guns don't work against them! "
2568,BRAGEN: Get back and fight them!
2569,
2570,[Corridor]
2571,
2572,(The rebels have constructed a barricade of boxes.
2573,They are shooting at a group of Bragen's guards when Janley and Valmar
2574,with their controlled Daleks.) 
2575,JANLEY: There and there! 
2576,(The Dalek fires at the guards.) 
2577,JANLEY: Over there! No! No! Over there! They're our people! 
2578,VALMAR: Cut the Dalek gun off! 
2579,JANLEY: No! 
2580,(Janley deactivates the control device but the Dalek fires on the
2581,rebels.) 
2582,VALMAR: I told you to cut the gun off! 
2583,JANLEY: I did! 
2584,VALMAR: You've killed our own people! 
2585,"VALMAR: We have to dismantle the gun, that's all. "
2586,"JANLEY: Oh, look at it! "
2587,DALEK: Your usefulness is over. 
2588,"(A guard appears, firing at the Dalek.) "
2589,"JANLEY: Come on! Quick, Val. Come on!"
2590,
2591,[Lesterson's laboratory]
2592,
2593,"POLLY: Doctor, it's stupid to hide in here! "
2594,"BEN: Well, do you fancy your chances outside in the corridor? No"
2595,thanks. 
2596,DOCTOR: The answer must be here somewhere. 
2597,LESTERSON: Shh! 
2598,"(Hearing Daleks coming from the capsule, Lesterson hides everyone under"
2599,the workbench.) 
2600,LESTERSON: You must be absolutely quiet. They know everything that's
2601,going on. Everything! They even know what you're thinking. 
2602,"BEN: Where do they get their power from, Lesterson? "
2603,"LESTERSON: Ah, I tried to turn the power off, but they were miles ahead"
2604,of me. Marvellous creatures. You have to admire them. 
2605,BEN: But we've got to stop them! 
2606,"LESTERSON: Oh, it's too late for that. They're the new species, you"
2607,"see, taking over from homo sapiens. Man's had his day. Finished now. "
2608,DALEK: The static circuit is nearly complete. 
2609,DALEK 2: Soon we can abandon the power we are using. 
2610,(Screams outside.) 
2611,DALEK: The humans are being exterminated. 
2612,(The two Daleks go into the capsule.) 
2613,BEN: Did you hear that? They're going to use their own power. 
2614,DOCTOR: The cables they laid. The trick I tried before won't work
2615,anymore. 
2616,"LESTERSON: Oh, if that's no good now, we're finished. All we can do is"
2617,marvel at the creatures who are taking our place. 
2618,[Corridor]
2619,
2620,VALMAR: No! 
2621,JANLEY: Come on! 
2622,VALMAR: Don't be a fool. 
2623,JANLEY: Come on! 
2624,(Quinn pulls Valmar to safety as a Dalek appears ahead. Janley shoots
2625,"at it, but of course she dies.)"
2626,
2627,[Lesterson's laboratory]
2628,
2629,"BEN: Take it easy, Polly. "
2630,"POLLY: Can't we do anything?! They're murdering everybody, one by one! "
2631,BEN: You've done all this. Why'd you give them power in the first
2632,place? 
2633,"LESTERSON: Well, I could control it, you see. And then Janley got one"
2634,"of her men, Valmar, I think it was, yes, and he rigged up a secret"
2635,cable. It's carrying power directly from the colony's supply. 
2636,"DOCTOR: Where? Where is it, Lesterson? "
2637,LESTERSON: Valmar's the only one who can answer that. Or the Daleks of
2638,"course. They know everything. Yes, you should ask the Daleks. "
2639,BEN: Then we must find Valmar. 
2640,DOCTOR: No. You stay here and look after Polly. I'll go. 
2641,MAN : Come on. This way. (scream) 
2642,(The Doctor uses the diversion of two guards fighting a Dalek to get
2643,"away down the corridor. A woman tries to enter the lab, but is killed"
2644,"in the doorway. Her companion tries to wrestle the Dalek, with the"
2645,usual result.)
2646,
2647,[Corridor]
2648,
2649,"(Valmar holds Janley's body, and cries.) "
2650,"QUINN: You'll have to leave her now, Valmar. "
2651,VALMAR: She wasn't as bad as you think. 
2652,DOCTOR: Valmar! Where is the Dalek power? 
2653,"QUINN: Get down, both of you! "
2654,"(As they play dead, a Dalek glides past them looking for signs of life,"
2655,and moves on.) 
2656,DOCTOR: Valmar. Valmar! Where is the Dalek power supply? 
2657,"QUINN: We've got to stop them, Valmar. She's dead. There's nothing you"
2658,can do for her. 
2659,"VALMAR: The main cable's inside the capsule, but there's nothing you"
2660,can do. 
2661,QUINN: There must be some way of cutting off the power! 
2662,DOCTOR: What makes you think I want to do that? We need more time. I
2663,know. A diversion. Bragen's guards. We'll have to use them to keep the
2664,Daleks busy. You go to Bragen. 
2665,[Governor's office]
2666,
2667,"BRAGEN: Section One, where's your report? Are you"
2668,"there, Section one? Section two? Section two? Why don't they answer?"
2669,"Can you hear me, Section two? Section three? Oh, why don't they answer?"
2670,I'm their Governor. Why don't they answer?
2671,
2672,[Lesterson's laboratory]
2673,
2674,(The colony is silent as the grave as the Daleks
2675,look for survivors.) 
2676,BRAGEN : This is Bragen speaking. I'm speaking to the Daleks.
2677,"Daleks, listen to me. I am the Governor. You must work for me. Do not"
2678,"trust the rebels. I will give you whatever you want, but immobilise"
2679,your guns. This is the Governor speaking. 
2680,"BEN: He's nuts, trying to talk to the Daleks. "
2681,(More Daleks leave the capsule and go out into the corridor.) 
2682,"BEN: Lesterson, what's in that cupboard? "
2683,LESTERSON: Nothing. It's quite empty. 
2684,"BEN: Well, come on, Polly, we'll be safe in there, love. "
2685,(Ben and Polly hide in the cupboard while Lesterson stays underneath
2686,the bench.)
2687,
2688,[Governor's office]
2689,
2690,"BRAGEN: Do you hear me, Daleks?! You will obey my"
2691,orders! 
2692,"QUINN: No use, Bragen. The Daleks have stopped obeying your orders. "
2693,BRAGEN: Guards! 
2694,QUINN: Dead! The Daleks have killed them. You still have your guard
2695,units in the interior. How long will it take them to get here? 
2696,BRAGEN: That depends. 
2697,"QUINN: Well, get them! "
2698,"BRAGEN: Well, they will be intercepted by the Daleks. "
2699,QUINN: Exactly! It will draw them away from here and give the Doctor a
2700,chance to deal with them. 
2701,BRAGEN: I refuse to allow my guards to be sacrificed. 
2702,QUINN: In that case the Daleks will destroy everything on this colony. 
2703,(Bragen switches on the communications unit.) 
2704,BRAGEN: Guards. This is Bragen speaking. All units will report
2705,immediately to the capital. Be prepared to face the rebel Daleks.
2706,There. Are you satisfied? 
2707,QUINN: I hope it works.
2708,
2709,[Lesterson's laboratory]
2710,
2711,(The Doctor returns with Valmar.) 
2712,DOCTOR: Ben! Polly! 
2713,(Ben and Polly come out of the cupboard.) 
2714,"BEN: Doctor, did you hear what Bragen said? "
2715,"DOCTOR: Yes, I did. "
2716,"BEN: Well, I only hope the Daleks do go for the guards. "
2717,POLLY: A lot of the Daleks went out just now. 
2718,"DOCTOR: Good, because we're going inside. Come on, Valmar. "
2719,(The Doctor and Valmar go into the capsule and come out with a junction
2720,box connected to a lot of cables.) 
2721,"DOCTOR: Ben, give us that spare cable over there. Polly, keep watch at"
2722,the door. 
2723,"BEN: Well, you know what you're doing? "
2724,DOCTOR: Of course I do. 
2725,"BEN: Well, why can't you just take all the plugs out and cut the power"
2726,off? 
2727,DOCTOR: Because I prefer to do it my way! 
2728,POLLY: Look out! 
2729,(Everyone takes cover as a Dalek enters. Valmar goes into the capsule
2730,"with the modified junction box, just missing another Dalek coming out.)"
2731,
2732,DALEK 2: Static power is being stored. We can dismantle the human
2733,electric system. 
2734,(The Doctor starts to edge his way round the room.) 
2735,DALEK: The law of the Daleks is in force. 
2736,DALEK 2: Extermination of humans. 
2737,(Lesterson stands up.) 
2738,DALEK: Our cables have been moved. 
2739,LESTERSON: And I could tell you who did it. 
2740,DALEK: What were you doing in there? 
2741,LESTERSON: I want to help you. 
2742,DALEK: Why? 
2743,LESTERSON: (like a Dalek) I am your servant. 
2744,DALEK: We do not need humans now. 
2745,"LESTERSON: Ah, but you wouldn't kill me. I gave you life. "
2746,"DALEK: Yes, you gave us life. "
2747,(So the Dalek kills him. The Doctor plugs his cable into the generator.
2748,"Nothing happens. The Daleks spot Valmar and turn, while the Doctor"
2749,pushes every button in sight. Valmar gets through the door just before
2750,the Daleks shoot. Ben pulls Polly out of sight. There's an explosion
2751,"and the Doctor is knocked down. The Daleks lose control, lights"
2752,flashing and smoke coming from their casings. One powers into the wall
2753,and the other bursts into flames.)
2754,
2755,[Colony]
2756,
2757,(Everywhere Daleks are affected by the power
2758,surge.) 
2759,DALEK 2: There are two 
2760,DALEK: Exterminate! Ah! Ah! Exterminate! 
2761,(The corridors fill with smoke from exploding Daleks.) 
2762,DALEK: Out of control! Out of Control! 
2763,(In the capsule the machinery goes haywire and explosions rip through
2764,it.)
2765,
2766,[Governor's office]
2767,
2768,"(A Dalek enters, but its dome blows off before it"
2769,can shoot at them.) 
2770,BRAGEN: What happened to it? 
2771,QUINN: I don't know. 
2772,"BRAGEN: It seems that your friend, the Examiner, was successful after"
2773,all. 
2774,"(Quinn relaxes, and Bragen gets the gun off him.) "
2775,BRAGEN: Now I shall restore law and order on this planet. 
2776,"QUINN: Not your law, Bragen. That's finished for good. "
2777,"BRAGEN: You'll obey me, or "
2778,"QUINN: Your day is over, Bragen. No one will obey you now. "
2779,"BRAGEN: I'm still the Governor, and you will. Valmar! "
2780,"(A shot rings out, but it is Bragen who falls dead.) "
2781,VALMAR: He was a murderer. 
2782,QUINN: Enough of guns. There's a lot of clearing up to be done. We will
2783,rebuild together. What is the extent of the damage? 
2784,"VALMAR: Oh, I don't know if its repairable. The whole electrical"
2785,system.
2786,
2787,[Lesterson's laboratory]
2788,
2789,QUINN: Are you all right? 
2790,"BEN: Oh, he's okay. The clot knocked himself out. "
2791,QUINN: It's a miracle. How did you do it? 
2792,DOCTOR: Eh? What happened? What did I do? What did I do? 
2793,"BEN: You destroyed the Daleks, that's what you did. "
2794,POLLY: No need to be modest about it. 
2795,DOCTOR: Did I do that? 
2796,POLLY: You know you did. 
2797,"VALMAR: You used the power from the colony's electric supply, overfed"
2798,"it and blew up their temporary static circuit. Well, didn't you? "
2799,DOCTOR: Did I do all that? 
2800,"VALMAR: You may have stopped the Daleks, but have you any idea of the"
2801,damage you've done to the colony? 
2802,"DOCTOR: Oh. There was a blow back, was there? "
2803,VALMAR: A blow back? Our power supply has been destroyed! It'll be
2804,months before we can get things back to normal. 
2805,QUINN: Valmar! 
2806,"DOCTOR: Oh, that is unfortunate. "
2807,VALMAR: But did it have to be this way? 
2808,"DOCTOR: I did a lot of damage, did I? "
2809,QUINN: Come on. 
2810,(Valmar and Quinn go to check the capsule.) 
2811,DOCTOR: I think we'd better get out of here before they send us the
2812,bill. 
2813,[Mercury swamp]
2814,
2815,(The Doctor and his companions walk to the Tardis.
2816,The Doctor is playing his recorder.) 
2817,"BEN: Well, I mean I didn't expect the brass bands to be playing, but I"
2818,wouldn't have thought a thank you would have hurt anybody. 
2819,"POLLY: But Ben, think of all those poor people all killed. "
2820,"BEN: I know, but the Doctor saved the colony from being completely"
2821,wiped out. 
2822,POLLY: Hmm. 
2823,"BEN: Yeah, and he was telling them all along, but would they listen? "
2824,"POLLY: Mind you, he wasn't very convincing when he was trying to"
2825,explain it to Valmar and Quinn and everybody. 
2826,"BEN: No, he wasn't, was he? "
2827,"POLLY: Doctor, you did know what you were doing, didn't you? "
2828,(The Doctor just chuckles and gives Polly a wink. There is a Dalek next
2829,"to the Tardis, its casing melted and scorched.) "
2830,"BEN: Oh, you needn't worry about them anymore, Doctor. Just a heap of"
2831,old iron now. 
2832,(Ben taps the Dalek casing and they all go into the Tardis. Moments
2833,later it dematerialises and the Dalek's eye-stalk lifts as if to
2834,watch.)
