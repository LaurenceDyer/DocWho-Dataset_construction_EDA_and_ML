20,One 
21, [Tardis]
22,
23,(The Tardis has reassembled itself and everyone is
24,on board.) 
25,"JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, it's all right. It worked. "
26,"DOCTOR: Jamie! You're right! We'd better just check, though. "
27,"ZOE: Are we actually on our way, Doctor, or are we stuck somewhere? "
28,"DOCTOR: Well, let's see shall we? "
29,(The Doctor switches on the scanner to show a cratered body in the
30,foreground and a blue and white planet further away.) 
31,JAMIE: Where are we? What's that? 
32,"ZOE: It's the moon, isn't it, Doctor? "
33,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes. That's the dark side of the moon. We seem to have"
34,stopped in space. 
35,ZOE: I remember seeing this before. 
36,"DOCTOR: Shush, Zoe. That light on the Moon's surface. Do you see it? "
37,ZOE: Doctor! It's getting bigger! It's coming towards us! 
38,"DOCTOR: Zoe, that's a missile! "
39,JAMIE: A what? 
40,"ZOE: It's a missile? Somebody's fired a missile at us, Jamie! Oh"
41,"Doctor, come on, let's get out of here. "
42,"DOCTOR: Now don't fuss me, Zoe. "
43,"ZOE: Well, what's happened? "
44,"DOCTOR: Well, it's the landing circuit. It seems to have jammed. That's"
45,why we're stuck in space. Ah. 
46,(The Doctor pulls a lever off and thumps the console with it.) 
47,"ZOE: We'll never make it! Oh, we're too late! "
48,"DOCTOR: Oh, the stupid thing! Oh! "
49,(KaBOOM. The Tardis has vanished and something else flies away from
50,"where it was. In a peaceful pasture, a cow looks up as a disembodied"
51,"blue flashing light appears above the ground, followed by a police box."
52,"In the Tardis, everyone gets up from the floor.) "
53,JAMIE: I think we've landed. 
54,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sorry about that, Jamie. Are you all right, Zoe? "
55,"ZOE: Yes, I think so. "
56,"JAMIE: Anyway, we weren't blown to pieces by that missile thing. "
57,ZOE: Why would anybody want to fire a missile at us? Surely they'd find
58,out who we were first? 
59,DOCTOR: Yes. Unless they knew already. 
60,"ZOE: The question is, was the object we saw on the other side of the"
61,moon in this time zone or not? 
62,JAMIE: You mean it could still be out there? 
63,"DOCTOR: Yes, let's have a look. "
64,(The scanner shows a curious cow. They all laugh.) 
65,"DOCTOR: We're certainly not on the moon's surface, are we. "
66,"JAMIE: What's the matter with the Tardis, Doctor? It keeps going wrong"
67,all the time. 
68,"DOCTOR: It merely needs an overhaul, Jamie, just like any piece of"
69,machinery. 
70,"ZOE: Well, haven't you got any spares? "
71,"DOCTOR: No, no. We shall have to see if we can get some made. Lets have"
72,"a further look, shall we? "
73,(An electricity pylon.) 
74,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, it could be twentieth century. England in summertime, I"
75,should say. See the rain clouds? We might try and look up our old
76,friend Professor Travers in London. He might be able to help us. 
77,JAMIE: Aye. 
78,"DOCTOR: Yes. Always supposing he's not a baby or a schoolboy. Now, come"
79,"along. Let's just collect this circuit, and I think I'd better see this"
80,one. There. It's all right. It's just a fault in the visual stabiliser
81,circuit. We'd better take that too. 
82,(The Tardis vanishes.) 
83,JAMIE: Doctor? Doctor? Where are you? 
84,"DOCTOR: Come along, take my hand. "
85,[Road]
86,
87,"(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe come out of the"
88,invisible Tardis and walk across the field to the road. I hope everyone
89,remembers where they parked. A military style lorry comes along and the
90,Doctor waves it down.) 
91,DOCTOR: I wonder if you could help us? 
92,MAN: Are you trying to get out? 
93,DOCTOR: We're trying to get to London. 
94,MAN: Get in. 
95,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's very civil of you. "
96,"MAN: Well shut up, will you, and get in. "
97,"(The Doctor, Zoe and Jamie climb into the back of the lorry. It drives"
98,off and two motorcycles follow. The driver sees them and after a short
99,while has to pull over. He opens the tailgate.) 
100,DOCTOR: Is something wrong? 
101,"MAN: Look, we'd better get clear of the lorry. Come on. "
102,[Roadside]
103,
104,(They hide in a small wood by the road.) 
105,JAMIE: What's happening? Why are we hiding? 
106,MAN: Company security were on my trail. 
107,ZOE: Which company? 
108,"MAN: Come on, there's only one company. "
109,"DOCTOR: Well, you see, we're strangers around here. "
110,"MAN: Strangers? Then you're not from the community, then? "
111,DOCTOR: No. 
112,MAN: Then how did you get inside the compound? 
113,"DOCTOR: Well, that's rather a long story. You see "
114,"ZOE: This community you talked about, are they prisoners here then? "
115,"MAN: Those who haven't gone over to the company are, yes. Not that they"
116,say you can't get out. They just make it pretty impossible without
117,passes. 
118,JAMIE: You can move in and out. 
119,MAN: I got in all right. But getting out might be just a bit more
120,difficult. 
121,"DOCTOR: This company, what do they do? "
122,MAN: International Electromatics. Now surely you've heard of them? 
123,"DOCTOR: Well, no, we've been a little out of touch. "
124,MAN: You must have been. They're the worlds biggest electronics
125,manufacturers. You can hardly buy a piece of equipment that isn't
126,"theirs. Quick, get down. "
127,(Two motorcycles roar past.) 
128,"ZOE: Well, what is this place, this compound? "
129,MAN: They set up a whole community of their own. Factories. Houses. A
130,vast network of industrial complexes. All of the local people have been
131,bought out. Most of them join the company. The others 
132,ZOE: What about them? 
133,MAN: My people haven't been able to trace them. 
134,DOCTOR: Your people? 
135,MAN: Should be safe now. We're not far from the guard post. You three
136,had better stay out of sight in the lorry. I'll try and bluff our way
137,out. Come on. 
138,[Lorry]
139,
140,(They come up to a gate in high chainlink fence
141,"topped with barbed wire, manned by uniformed armed guards.) "
142,JAMIE: We're slowing down. Must be the guard post now. 
143,"ZOE: Yes, but why are we hiding like this? We've done nothing wrong. "
144,DOCTOR: We'll find out later. Keep down. 
145,(One guard checks the man's pass while another walks round the lorry.
146,"The man is allowed to drive on. Shortly afterwards, the motorcycle"
147,riders arrive.)
148,
149,[Road]
150,
151,(The lorry stops and the man opens the tailgate.) 
152,MAN: They're right behind us. 
153,"DOCTOR: Oh, well, thank you very much. "
154,"MAN: They're there in the distance. Now come on, get lost! "
155,"(The Doctor, Zoe and Jamie go behind the hedge and leave. The"
156,motorcycles pull up. The riders are wearing the same uniforms as the
157,guards at the gate.) 
158,"BIKER: Hey, you. I want to see your pass. You will come back with us"
159,for questioning. 
160,"MAN: Oh come off it. That pass is in order, isn't it? "
161,BIKER: Don't argue! Follow us. 
162,"MAN: Oh, no, I'm not going back inside that compound, and there's"
163,nothing you can do to make me. 
164,BIKER: You will come back with us. 
165,"MAN: Look we're not on IE property now, you've no authority. "
166,(The bikers aim their pistols at him.) 
167,"MAN: Sorry. You want to hold me, get onto the police. See you. "
168,"(The bikers shoot the man. A little way away, the Doctor flags down a"
169,car.) 
170,DOCTOR: Can you give us a lift to London? 
171,"CAMFIELD: Yes, I suppose so. "
172,"(This is the director, Douglas Camfield.) "
173,DOCTOR: In you get. 
174,CAMFIELD: All right? 
175,"(Zoe and Jamie get in the back, while the Doctor takes the passenger"
176,seat.) 
177,JAMIE: Thank you. Thank you very much. 
178,
179,[Outside Travers' house]
180,
181,(The Doctor goes up the steps to the front door of
182,"number 18, St James' Gardens.) "
183,DOCTOR: Here we are. Right. That's odd. It says Watkins. 
184,JAMIE: Must have the wrong house. 
185,"DOCTOR: Well, the telephone directory definitely said number eighteen."
186,We'll ask. 
187,"(The Doctor rings the bell labelled Watkins several times, until the"
188,"occupant, a young woman gets fed up and answers it.) "
189,"ISOBEL: If you don't mind, I'm trying to work! "
190,[Lounge]
191,
192,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sorry miss, but we wondered whether"
193,you could help us? We wondered if 
194,(Isobel takes a camera off its tripod.) 
195,"ISOBEL: Oh look, the stupid thing's gone and jammed. "
196,DOCTOR: Oh dear. Perhaps I could help you. 
197,"ISOBEL: Well, do you know anything about cameras? "
198,"DOCTOR: Yes, a little. I see "
199,"ISOBEL: Now, I had it on automatic shutter. "
200,DOCTOR: You're taking photos of yourself? 
201,"ISOBEL: Yes, and then you interrupted me and the stupid thing jammed!"
202,Have you come to see my uncle? He's not here. But who are you? Friends
203,of his? Fellow nuts? 
204,DOCTOR: Please let me answer one question at a time. 
205,"ISOBEL: Hey, you be careful of that thing. It cost me a fortune. "
206,"DOCTOR: It's all right, it's a very simple mechanism. Who is your"
207,uncle? 
208,ISOBEL: Professor Watkins. 
209,DOCTOR: Oh. Then Professor Travers doesn't live here? 
210,"ISOBEL: Well, he did. He left about a month ago. Gone to America for a"
211,year with his daughter. 
212,"JAMIE: Oh, that's just great. "
213,ISOBEL: My uncle worked at the Cavendish labs. He wanted to do some
214,work so Professor Travers said he could use his daughter's lab here.
215,And I moved in because I got kicked out of my studio last week. 
216,DOCTOR: What field of science is your uncle in? 
217,"ISOBEL: Oh, I don't know. He's in applied physics or something. Always"
218,messing around with computers and things. Complete nuts. 
219,DOCTOR: Well that is fortunate. Perhaps he might be able to help us. Is
220,he at home? 
221,ISOBEL: No. 
222,"DOCTOR: Well, where is he? "
223,"ISOBEL: Well, how do I know? I'm not his keeper. Hey, have you fixed"
224,it? 
225,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, that's all right. "
226,ISOBEL: That's really great. Thanks! 
227,DOCTOR: Miss. 
228,ISOBEL: (to Zoe) Hey! That's a jolly outfit. (the glitter catsuit)
229,Would you mind posing for me? 
230,ZOE: What? 
231,"ISOBEL: Look, just stand there. "
232,DOCTOR: Miss? 
233,"ISOBEL: Isobel. Yeah. Now, just stand here. Head over the shoulder. "
234,DOCTOR: Have you any idea when your uncle is going to be back? 
235,"ISOBEL: No, he left about a week ago, I haven't seen him since. "
236,JAMIE: A week? 
237,"ISOBEL: Yeah, he was prattling on about some new invention, or"
238,"something or other, and having the chance to develop it. Now. Not you. "
239,JAMIE: Oh. 
240,"ISOBEL: Okay now, just "
241,DOCTOR: Can't you get in touch with him? 
242,"ISOBEL: No, I tried. I wanted to borrow a couple of quid off him in a"
243,"hurry, but well, they said he wasn't available for phone calls. "
244,DOCTOR: They? Now who is they? 
245,"ISOBEL: Just get that, will you? I don't know. International Electric"
246,something or other. 
247,ZOE: International Electromatics? 
248,"ISOBEL: Yes, probably. "
249,"DOCTOR: You mean your uncle has gone to work for these people? Well,"
250,surely we can get in touch with him. 
251,"ISOBEL: Well, you can try telephoning but I doubt if you'll get any"
252,joy. Phone's in the hall and the number's scribbled on the wall. 
253,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
254,(The Doctor and Jamie leave.) 
255,ISOBEL: Hey. Don't go. I don't often get the chance of photographing a
256,real model. 
257,"ZOE: Oh, all right. "
258,ISOBEL: Come on. Let's get you fixed up with some gear.
259,
260,[Hallway]
261,
262,(Jamie reads the number off the wall as the Doctor
263,dials.) 
264,JAMIE: Three. 
265,DOCTOR: Three. 
266,JAMIE: Four. 
267,DOCTOR: Four. 
268,JAMIE: Two. 
269,DOCTOR: Two. 
270,"JAMIE: Doctor, Do you suppose this firm could be the one that driver"
271,was talking about? 
272,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sure of it. "
273,"JAMIE: In that case, Watkins could have been kidnapped! "
274,"DOCTOR: Ah, Jamie. You mustn't let your imagination run away with you."
275,"I must admit, it's a bit strange. "
276,WOMAN : International Electromatics company. State your business. 
277,"DOCTOR: I would like, please, to speak with Professor Watkins. "
278,WOMAN : One moment. (long pause) Party not available. 
279,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, you see, but this is very important. "
280,WOMAN : Party not available. 
281,"DOCTOR: Yes, but I must speak with him. "
282,WOMAN : Party not available. Party not available. 
283,"DOCTOR: But this is an automatic answering device! Ah, shut up, you"
284,stupid machine! 
285,(The Doctor puts the phone down.) 
286,JAMIE: Now what? 
287,DOCTOR: There's only one thing for it. We'll have to go there
288,ourselves.
289,
290,[Lounge]
291,
292,(Zoe is wearing a feather boa round her neck and a
293,mini-pinafore dress now. Isobel is photographing her from below.) 
294,"ISOBEL: Okay, that's fabulous. Just keep it like that. Great. "
295,(The Doctor and Jamie enter.) 
296,ISOBEL: Any luck? 
297,"DOCTOR: No, it was stupid simple-minded computer answering service. "
298,"ISOBEL: Well, what do we do now? "
299,"DOCTOR: Jamie and I are going to this place. Come on, Zoe. "
300,"ZOE: No, thanks. I think I'll stay here. It's great fun. "
301,JAMIE: You look like a chicken with all those feathers on! 
302,"DOCTOR: Oh well, come on, Jamie. Oh, the address? "
303,"ISOBEL: Oh, that's scribbled on the wall too. "
304,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. "
305,JAMIE: Do you not write anything down on paper at all? 
306,"ISOBEL: Well, I'd only lose it if I did. Writing on a wall's much"
307,"safer. You can't lose a wall, can you? "
308,JAMIE: No. 
309,"ISOBEL: Okay, listen. Just put your boa round your head. Okay, now"
310,bring your eyes just into me. Okay.
311,
312,[IE Reception]
313,
314,(The Doctor and Jamie arrive at a large skyscraper
315,- Millbank Tower actually - and enter the deserted reception area.
316,There is one door labelled IE - no unauthorised entry - so the Doctor
317,"goes through. Outside, two men in a car watch them. The Doctor comes"
318,face to face with computer bank complete with magnetic tape and
319,flashing lights.) 
320,DOCTOR: I thought so. 
321,JAMIE: What? 
322,DOCTOR: More stupid computers. Automatic receptionists. Right. 
323,WOMAN: International Electromatic Company. State your business. 
324,"DOCTOR: I would like, please, to speak with Professor Watkins. "
325,WOMAN: One moment. Party not available. 
326,DOCTOR: Then I would like to speak with someone in authority. 
327,WOMAN: Your request will be considered and your appointment arranged.
328,Please state your name and address. 
329,DOCTOR: That's no good. I wish to speak with somebody now. 
330,WOMAN: I am sorry. All personnel are engaged. 
331,DOCTOR: But I insist. This is an emergency! 
332,WOMAN: State the nature of the emergency. 
333,DOCTOR: It's a private matter. 
334,WOMAN: Private matters have no emergency status. 
335,"DOCTOR: Oh shut up, you stupid machine! Diabolical inventions. "
336,JAMIE: What now? 
337,DOCTOR: Come on. 
338,JAMIE: Where are we going? 
339,"DOCTOR: Well, there must be somebody else in this building except these"
340,stupid machines. Come on. 
341,"(The Doctor and Jamie go out and down a back alley, watched by security"
342,cameras.)
343,
344,[Outside IE]
345,
346,(In the car.) 
347,BENTON: HQ are checking now. Where are they? 
348,"TRACY: Gone round the back, down the side alley. "
349,"BENTON: That's a dead end, isn't it? So they've got to come out this"
350,way. 
351,TRACY: If they come out.
352,
353, [Vaughn's office]
354,
355,(A silver haired man - Vaughn - is watching the
356,Doctor and Jamie on a monitor.) 
357,PACKER: Well? 
358,VAUGHN: The same two? 
359,PACKER: Yeah. 
360,VAUGHN: Deal with them. 
361,(Packer leaves. Vaughn presses a button as Jamie and the Doctor step
362,"out of a lift. Gas pours out of a nozzle, filling the corridor, and"
363,they collapse.)
364,
365, [Outside IE]
366,
367,(In the car.) 
368,BENTON: Okay lets move. 
369,TRACY: HQ? 
370,"BENTON: Yes, they've run a check. They want these two. Priority. "
371,"TRACY: Right, let's get 'em."
372,
373,[Corridor]
374,
375, (Packer and guards come out of the lift and take
376,hold of the Doctor.) 
377,DOCTOR: Wait! 
378,PACKER: (raising his fist.) This will be my pleasure. 
379,VAUGHN : Packer! Bring them to my office. 
380,"PACKER: But Mister Vaughn, I haven't interrogated them yet. "
381,"VAUGHN : Packer, please do as I say. "
382,"PACKER: Yes, sir. Come on. This way."
383,
384, [Vaughn's office]
385,
386,(Sunlight streams through the vertical blinds.) 
387,"VAUGHN: Come and sit down, gentlemen. "
388,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
389,"VAUGHN: You can go, Packer. "
390,"PACKER: But Mister Vaughn, I "
391,"VAUGHN: Thank you, Packer. Thank you. "
392,PACKER: Yes sir. 
393,(Packer leaves.) 
394,VAUGHN: I must apologise for Packer's crude devotion to duty. But your
395,"method of entry into my building was rather unconventional, wasn't it? "
396,"JAMIE: Aye, well, there was no need for all that gas and stuff. "
397,DOCTOR: Jamie. I think perhaps it is we who should be apologising to
398,"you, Mister "
399,VAUGHN: Vaughn. Tobias Vaughn. I'm the managing director of
400,International Electromatics. Your business must be very pressing to
401,force you to such extremes. 
402,"DOCTOR: Yes, it is. "
403,VAUGHN: Concerning Professor Watkins? 
404,JAMIE: How did you know? 
405,VAUGHN: My computer. It reported directly to me. 
406,"DOCTOR: Oh, I see. "
407,"VAUGHN: You've gone to a lot of trouble for nothing, you know. The"
408,Professor's working on an experiment and refuses to see anyone. 
409,"JAMIE: Ah, well, we only want to talk to him, you see. "
410,VAUGHN: Perhaps I can help. 
411,"DOCTOR: No, I don't think so, thank you very much. "
412,"JAMIE: Oh, come on Doctor. It's only a couple of electronic circuits. "
413,(The Doctor kicks Jamie on the ankle.) 
414,VAUGHN: Circuits? Electronic circuits? My technicians are the best in
415,the world. I'm sure they'd be able to assist you. Show me the circuits.
416,
417,"DOCTOR: Well, I "
418,"VAUGHN: Please, I'd like to help. "
419,(The Doctor hands Vaughn the Tardis circuits.) 
420,"VAUGHN: As you say, rather complex. However, I'm sure we'll be able to"
421,help you. 
422,"DOCTOR: Yes, I. "
423,VAUGHN: I'll have them sent to my workshops immediately. 
424,"DOCTOR: Oh, how very kind. "
425,VAUGHN: Not at all. Professor Watkins is a valued colleague. Any friend
426,of his is. 
427,"(Vaughn puts the circuits in a drawer, next to a pistol.) "
428,"VAUGHN: Oh, have you got one of these, young man? "
429,JAMIE: No. What is it? 
430,VAUGHN: Surely you've seen them about. They're disposable transistor
431,radios. One of our latest products. Most popular. We've sold ten
432,million in this country alone. Here. Compensation for the treatment you
433,received from the worthy Packer. 
434,JAMIE: Thank you. How does it work? 
435,(Jamie presses the only button and loud music plays. The Doctor
436,switches it off again.) 
437,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's how you turn it off, Jamie. "
438,"VAUGHN: Now if you'll excuse me, I'm afraid I have an urgent"
439,appointment. 
440,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Come along, Jamie. "
441,"VAUGHN: Packer will meet you and show you the way out, Mister? "
442,DOCTOR: Doctor. Goodbye. 
443,"VAUGHN: Goodbye, Doctor. "
444,"JAMIE: Goodbye, Mister Vaughn. Thank you for the radio. "
445,VAUGHN: Not at all.
446,(The Doctor and Jamie leave. Vaughn looks closely at one of the
447,circuits then activates his intercom.) 
448,VAUGHN: Packer? 
449,"PACKER : Yes, Mister Vaughn? "
450,"VAUGHN: Show our visitors off the premises, will you? "
451,"PACKER : Very good, sir."
452,
453,[Outside IE]
454,
455,"PACKER: The next time, read the notice on the door."
456,
457,"JAMIE: Oh, don't tell me you can read as well. What else do you do!? "
458,DOCTOR: Jamie! 
459,(Packer goes back inside.) 
460,JAMIE: Friendly sort of chap. 
461,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
462,JAMIE: Is something wrong? 
463,DOCTOR: Yes. That fellow's not what he seems. 
464,JAMIE: That big idiot? Oh don't worry. I'll soon sort 
465,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. I mean Vaughn. The normal range of human blinking"
466,is about once every ten or fifteen seconds. Vaughn was blinking far
467,less frequently than that. 
468,"JAMIE: Oh, and he's got a forked tail and wee horns. "
469,"DOCTOR: Oh I'm not joking, Jamie. Underneath all that charm there was"
470,something odd. Sinister. Almost inhuman.

489,Isobel takes an upward photograph.) 
490,"ISOBEL: Hold it now. Last one. Okay, you can relax. "
491,ZOE: Oh good. I didn't know standing still could be so exhausting. 
492,ISOBEL: Would you like some coffee? 
493,"ZOE: Mmm, please. How long have they been gone? "
494,"ISOBEL: Oh, I don't know. About a couple of hours, I suppose. "
495,ZOE: I hope they're all right. 
496,"ISOBEL: Oh, of course they are. Probably got themselves lost or"
497,"something. What's so important about these, er, circuit things you were"
498,"telling me about, anyway? "
499,"ZOE: Well, they were part of the. Well, it's a sort of machine we"
500,travel in. 
501,ISOBEL: Oh. You mean a sort of electric car? 
502,"ZOE: Well, it's a bit more sophisticated than that. "
503,"ISOBEL: Oh, well anyway, I'm hope that you're going to stick around for"
504,a bit. I get sick of photographing myself. 
505,"ZOE: Oh, why don't you always use a model? "
506,ISOBEL: Can't afford it. I've only just got about enough cash to buy
507,"all the junk I need for the camera. It's an expensive business and,"
508,"well, I'm not good enough to be a professional yet. "
509,"ZOE: Well, I think you're very good. These photographs of you are"
510,splendid. 
511,"ISOBEL: Yeah. Yeah, they're great but I didn't take them. I was just"
512,the model. That's how I earned the loot to pay for all this. 
513,"ZOE: Oh, I see. "
514,"ISOBEL: You're still worried about your two friends, aren't you? "
515,"ZOE: Yes, a bit. "
516,"ISOBEL: They can't have got themselves into any sort of trouble, can"
517,they? 
518,"ZOE: Oh, you wouldn't say that if you knew them. If there's trouble to"
519,"be found, the Doctor and Jamie can't miss it."

524,find another Jaguar stopped in front of them. The men get out as the
525,first car comes round the corner behind them and Benton and Tracy get
526,out.)

528,"DOCTOR: Accept the situation, Jamie. There's nothing else we can do. "

536,more coherent a reply than an enigmatic shake of the head. 
537,"GREGORY: I'm sorry, Mister Vaughn. I've never seen anything like these"
538,before. Given time I might be able 
539,"VAUGHN: Then take time, my dear fellow. "

543,VAUGHN: Packer. 
544,"PACKER : Yes, Mister Vaughn? "
545,"VAUGHN: Packer, those two uninvited guests we had this morning. I"
546,assume they were photographed? 
547,"PACKER : Yes, sir. Security cameras will have taken visual"

556,"ZOE: Oh, yes. "
557,ISOBEL: What's the matter? Don't you like it? 
558,"ZOE: Oh, yes, it's fine. "
559,"ISOBEL: You're still worried about your two friends, aren't you? Why? "
560,"ZOE: Oh, I don't know. I've just got this feeling that something's"
561,happened to them. 
562,ISOBEL: Why on earth should it have? 
563,"ZOE: No reason at all, really. It's not a logical conclusion, just"
564,intuition. 
565,"ISOBEL: Well, I'll tell you what we'll do then. We'll go right out"
566,"after them, okay? "
567,"ZOE: Oh yes, please. "
568,ISOBEL: We'd better leave a note for them just in case they come back
569,when we're not here.

578,northern hemisphere centred on the North Pole into an area where
579,military personnel in grey uniforms with UNIT shoulder flashes are
580,working. Benton and Tracy follow.) 
581,JAMIE: Would you mind telling us what all this is about? 
582,"BENTON: You'll find out, sir. "
583,JAMIE: Sir? 
584,(An officer comes out of a forward compartment.) 
585,"BRIGADIER: All right, Benton, thank you. "
586,BENTON: Sir. 
587,"TRACY: NAAFI break, sir? "
588,BRIGADIER: Very well. 
589,(Benton and Tracy leave.) 
590,"BRIGADIER: How nice to see you again, Doctor. "
591,DOCTOR: It's Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart! 
592,"BRIGADIER: Ah, Brigadier now. I've gone on up in the world. "
593,"JAMIE: Oh course, the Yetis. We met you in the "
594,"BRIGADIER: That's right, McCrimmon, in the underground. Must be four"
595,years ago now. 
596,"JAMIE: That long. It only seems about a couple of weeks ago, doesn't"
597,it. 
598,"DOCTOR: I've told you over and over again, Jamie. Time is relative. "
599,"BRIGADIER: Are you still making a nonsense of it. Doctor, in your, what"
600,was it called? Tardis? 
601,"DOCTOR: Yes, we're still travelling. Yes. "
602,"BRIGADIER: Yes, Mister Travers told me all about it. It's er, well"
603,"it's, to say the least, an unbelievable machine. "
604,DOCTOR: Any more unbelievable than the Yetis? 
605,"BRIGADIER: No, true. I'm not quite so much of a sceptic as I was since"
606,that little escapade. 
607,"DOCTOR: But what's all this, and why all the cloak and dagger stuff to"
608,bring us here? 
609,"BRIGADIER: Yes, I'm sorry about that but my chaps have to be a bit"
610,"melodramatic in their methods. But I'll explain. Look, do sit down. "
611,JAMIE: Thank you. 
612,DOCTOR: How nice. 
613,"BRIGADIER: Oh, Sergeant Walters! "
614,WALTERS: Yes sir? 
615,"BRIGADIER: Lay on some tea, will you? You'd like some tea, wouldn't"
616,"you, Doctor? "
617,"DOCTOR: Oh thank you, and a patty cake biscuit. Thank you. "
618,"BRIGADIER: Yes, well, since the Yeti do, I've been in charge of an"
619,independent intelligence group that we call UNIT. That's United Nations
620,Intelligence Taskforce. 
621,JAMIE: You mean you're like a world secret police. 
622,"BRIGADIER: Not quite. We don't actually arrest people, just investigate"
623,them. 
624,"JAMIE: But what about us? I mean, you arrested us. "
625,"BRIGADIER: Not really. You see, my men were keeping a watch on the"
626,International Electromatic Headquarters when you two showed up. I've
627,been keeping a check on everyone going in that building. Your
628,photographs were transmitted to this Headquarters and I recognised you.
629,
630,DOCTOR: But what's so odd about people going into the building? 
631,"BRIGADIER: Oh, nothing odd about them going in. The trouble is, some of"
632,them haven't come out.
633,
634,[IE Reception]
635,
636,ZOE: Looks like a robot reception. 
637,"ISOBEL: Yeah. Yes, This probably the same idiot machine that answers"
638,the telephone when you ring up. 
639,(Zoe switches it on.) 
640,WOMAN: International Electromatic Company. State your business.

649,VAUGHN: Has the information been considered? 
650,PLANNER: The images of the two humans have been analysed and
651,registered. They are known and are hostile. 
652,VAUGHN: Hostile? How can that be? Have you been on Earth before? 
653,"PLANNER: No, they have been recognised on Planet Fourteen. They are"
654,dangerous and must be destroyed. 
655,VAUGHN: Planet Fourteen? But how? 
656,PLANNER: They must be destroyed. 
657,"VAUGHN: Yes, I'll deal with them. "
658,PLANNER: Plans for invasion are nearing completion. Nothing must be
659,allowed to interrupt them. 
660,VAUGHN: Don't worry. Nothing will. 
661,PLANNER: Nothing must be allowed to interrupt them.

663,shows Zoe with his automated receptionist.)

666,
667,"ZOE: Now listen to me, you stupid, primitive"
668,"machine, I asked a perfectly simple question, and I expect an answer. "
669,WOMAN: No information available. 
670,ISOBEL: It's no good Zoe. 
671,ZOE: I will not be beaten by this brainless tin box. 
672,ISOBEL: But you can't do anything about it. 
673,"ZOE: Can't I? A little problem in ALGOL, I think. "
674,ISOBEL: In what? 
675,ZOE: ALGOL. It's a sort of language you talk to computers in. Now
676,watch. 
677,(Zoe switches on the machine again.) 
678,WOMAN: International Electromatic Company. State your business. 
679,"ZOE: Begin. Real X sum positive. Delete square. Begin sum two,"
680,subscript J. 
681,ISOBEL: That's ALGOL? 
682,ZOE: Integer compute. Printout Y to the minus X variable one. I'm
683,enjoying this. 
684,WOMAN: International Electro 
685,ZOE: Go to finish. Continue. Integrate on iversine. 
686,(Smoke comes from the magnetic tapes.) 
687,ISOBEL: It seems to be getting a little bit heated. 
688,ZOE: You bet. This equation is insoluble. 
689,"ISOBEL: Zoe, I think you ought to stand back. "
690,(ZOE stands back with ISOBEL and tells the computer.) 
691,"ZOE: Now, continue printout continuous integration. "
692,(The computer goes Bang. Zoe and Isobel laugh.)

697,VAUGHN: Packer! 
698,(PACKER appears on the intercom.) 
699,"PACKER : Yes, sir? "
700,VAUGHN: Reception. Two young girls. Bring them to me. 
701,"PACKER : Right, Mister Vaughn. "
702,[IE Reception]
703,
704,ZOE: It'll take more than a soldering iron to put
705,that right. 
706,"ISOBEL: Hey, don't you think we better get out of here before somebody"
707,gets annoyed? 
708,ZOE: Oh yes. I think perhaps you're right.

711,[Aeroplane]
712,
713,(There are a series of overhead photographs on the
714,map table.) 
715,"BRIGADIER: This is Gordon Jones, lecturer in physics, Churchill"
716,"College, Cambridge. Next one's a chap I knew at Sandhurst, old Billy"
717,Rutlidge. He's got himself a very cushy number at the Ministry of
718,Defence. 
719,"DOCTOR: And all these people went into the building, the IE building,"
720,and didn't come out. 
721,"BRIGADIER: No, no, most of them came out again, but there was something"
722,definitely odd about them when they did. 
723,DOCTOR: Odd? 
724,"BRIGADIER: Yes, old Billy Rutlidge, for instance. He was quite"
725,cooperative about my investigation into Vaughn initially but after he'd
726,been to the IE Building he started getting a bit sticky about it. 
727,"JAMIE: Doctor, would you look at that one! "
728,BRIGADIER: Do you know this man? 
729,"DOCTOR: Jamie, yes. "
730,"JAMIE: Aye, he gave us a lift in his lorry. "
731,BRIGADIER: When did you last see him? 
732,JAMIE: This morning. 
733,BRIGADIER: This man's an agent of ours. His report is almost twelve
734,hours overdue. 
735,"JAMIE: Ah, well he did say something about some security guards on his"
736,tail. 
737,DOCTOR: I expect that he's all right. He was all right this morning
738,"when we left him. Brigadier, tell me more about this International"
739,Electromatics set-up. 
740,"BRIGADIER: Oh, there isn't much to tell. The head of the group is a man"
741,named Tobias Vaughn. 
742,"JAMIE: Oh yes, we've met him. A nice man. He gave me this. "
743,"DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie, don't "
744,"BRIGADIER: Oh yes, that's just the small stuff. They control"
745,practically all of the major computer lines. 
746,DOCTOR: Put it away. 
747,BRIGADIER: They made their real breakthrough in micro-monolithic
748,"circuit designs, undercutting practically everyone else in the market. "
749,DOCTOR: But what's your interest in this? 
750,"BRIGADIER: Well, I knew a little about Vaughn before his sudden"
751,success. I put out a routine check on him and we came up with one or
752,two things of interest. 
753,JAMIE: Like the disappearance of Professor Watkins. 
754,BRIGADIER: Yes. 
755,JAMIE: Ah. See? 
756,DOCTOR: I see. I don't suppose you have any authority to search the
757,"building, have you? "
758,BRIGADIER: No. Vaughn's too powerful. He's got too many top people on
759,"his side. You see, Doctor, I daren't make a move against him unless I"
760,have good reason to do so. 
761,"DOCTOR: Well, it looks to me if Jamie and I want to find the Professor,"
762,we'll have to find him in our own way. 
763,"BRIGADIER: That's about the sum of it. However, should you find"
764,yourself in any difficulty. Sergeant Walters! 
765,"WALTERS: Yes, sir? BRIGADIER: Got a TM-45 handy? "
766,"WALTERS: Yes, sir. Right here. "
767,DOCTOR: Is that a tank? 
768,"BRIGADIER: Oh no, no. My units are on constant alert, so should you"
769,"find yourselves in any real trouble, you can just give us a call. "
770,DOCTOR: Jolly good. 
771,"WALTERS: Here you are, sir. "
772,"BRIGADIER: Thank you, Sergeant. "
773,"BRIGADIER: Now, this is a small transceiver, range of about fifty miles"
774,on a set frequency. Just press this button and ask for me. 
775,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, that's splendid. Yes, this should come in very handy. "
776,"BRIGADIER: Call me any time. I'm usually available. Now, I'd better lay"
777,on transport to get you two back to London.
778,[Outside Travers' house]
779,
780,(No answer to the doorbell.) 
781,JAMIE: No. They must have gone out. 
782,(But the front door opens as Jamie leans on it.) 
783,DOCTOR: Zoe? Isobel? 
784,[Lounge]
785,
786, JAMIE: Probably gone for a walk. 
787,"DOCTOR: Look, Jamie, sandwiches. I'm hungry. Want one? "
788,"JAMIE: Thank you. You know, Doctor. That chap, Mister Vaughn, doesn't"
789,seem such a bad man. 
790,(Jamie turns his radio on.) 
791,"DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie. How can I think when you've got that thing on? "
792,JAMIE: Hey! 
793,"(The Doctor examines the little trannie.) DOCTOR: All right, all right."
794,
795,JAMIE: Don't break it. 
796,"DOCTOR: All right! I just want to take a look at it, that's all. Oh,"
797,yes. It's an interesting little piece of 
798,JAMIE: What? 
799,"DOCTOR: Well, well, well. What have we here? "
800,"JAMIE: What do you mean, what have we here? "
801,DOCTOR: There's a micro-monolithic circuit in the back plate of this
802,radio. 
803,"JAMIE: Well, what's that? "
804,DOCTOR: It's a very complex circuit in miniature. 
805,JAMIE: What's so odd about that? 
806,"DOCTOR: It has nothing to do with the radio, as far as I can see. "
807,"JAMIE: Oh Doctor, just put it back together again. "
808,DOCTOR: All right! 
809,"JAMIE: I don't suppose Zoe would have left a note, do you? No, I can't"
810,see anything. Well you might at least help me look for it. 
811,DOCTOR: I suggest that we try the wall. 
812,JAMIE: Eh? 
813, [Hallway] 
814, DOCTOR: Isobel never writes anything on paper. You
815,"can't lose a wall, remember. JAMIE: Oh. Ah! Tired of waiting. Gone to"
816,IE offices to look for you. Zoe and Isobel. DOCTOR: Jamie! We'd better
817,go after them.
818,
819,[Vaughn's office]
820,
821," VAUGHN: You and your friend the Doctor, have"
822,caused some considerable trouble today. First he breaks into this
823,building and then you ruin a very expensive device. 
824,ISOBEL: Only because the stupid thing wouldn't tell us what we wanted
825,to know. 
826,"VAUGHN: Ah, yes, Miss Watkins. You're concerned about your uncle,"
827,aren't you? 
828,"ISOBEL: I'd like to know where he is, yes. "
829,"VAUGHN: He's perfectly well, I assure you, although a little, er,"
830,uncooperative at the moment. Your visit here is most opportune. I think
831,that you can be very useful to me. 
832,ISOBEL: Me? But how? 
833,VAUGHN: Your uncle needs to be persuaded to continue his work for me. 
834,ISOBEL: But I can't do anything about that. 
835,"VAUGHN: No, But I can now. Packer, I'd like you to take care of these"
836,two young ladies please. 
837,PACKER: Take them!

843,beckons him on down the side of the building.) 
844,JAMIE: I thought that we were going in there to look for Zoe and
845,Isobel? 
846,"DOCTOR: There's no one in there except that stupid computer, and that's"
847,won't tell us anything. 
848,JAMIE: But how are we going to find out that they are in there? 
849,"DOCTOR: Well, if the Brigadier's men are still around, they should have"
850,seen them go in. Hello? 
851,"MAN : UNIT to operations, over. "
852,"DOCTOR: Hello, could I speak to the Brigadier? "
853,MAN : Stand by. Out.

855,"JAMIE: Aye, but doesn't play tunes like mine."

858,
859," BRIGADIER: Yes, Doctor. I've got a report here on"
860,"two girls. About nineteen or so. One of them dark, one of them fair."
861,One of them was wearing very distinct clothes. 
862,"JAMIE : Zoe! Doctor, that could have been Zoe. "
863,"DOCTOR : Jamie, just a minute please. Brigadier. "
864,BRIGADIER: Yes? 
865,DOCTOR : These clothes. Did they include a rather brightly-coloured
866,feather boa? 
867,"BRIGADIER: Yes, the little dark one was wearing that. They friends of"
868,yours? 
869,"DOCTOR : Yes, I'm afraid they are. "
870,"JAMIE : Doctor, come on, let's get after them. "
871,"DOCTOR : All right, all right, Jamie. Brigadier, we're going to try"
872,to get into the building and try to find them. 
873,"BRIGADIER: Yes, well, be careful. You may not be so lucky this time."
874,Call me if you get into trouble. 
875,DOCTOR : Thanks. 
876,"BRIGADIER: Right, over and out. "
877,"TURNER: Is it wise to let them go in alone, sir? I mean, they don't"
878,exactly sound like professionals to me. 
879,"BRIGADIER: Don't underestimate them, Jimmy. They may look like"
880,"amateurs, but that man has an incredible knack of being one jump ahead"
881,"of everyone. If there is a safe way into that place, he'll be the one"
882,to find it.

887,Park Royal - Guinness Brewery really - and look through the chainlink

895,
896," GREGORY: I'm sorry, sir, but these circuits don't"
897,"make sense. The material isn't any known metal alloy. In fact, the"
898,"structure's more that of a plastic. What's more, the connections seems"
899,to be to be completely illogical. 
900,VAUGHN: Hmm. How very interesting. This strange Doctor intrigues me
901,more and more. 
902,"GREGORY: I can do some more tests on the circuits if you like, sir, but"

912,possible? 
913,PLANNER: These questions are unnecessary. He must be destroyed. 
914,VAUGHN: That is for me to decide. 
915,PLANNER: You will obey. 
916,VAUGHN: You forget I control the operation from Earth! Unless that's
917,"clearly understood, our partnership will cease! Tell that to your"
918,leader. 
919,PLANNER: It has been agreed. 
920,"VAUGHN: I felt sure you would be reasonable. Now, you say you"
921,recognised this Doctor on Planet Fourteen. How did he get there? 
922,PLANNER: He has a machine. 
923,VAUGHN: What sort of machine? 
924,PLANNER: We have no more information. But he must be destroyed. The
925,invasion must succeed. 
926,VAUGHN: It will. The Doctor will be taken care of. I shall see to that
927,personally.

929,[Warehouse]
930,
931,(An eight foot metal container with what looks like
932,a bottle cap on both ends is carried in and laid on the floor. There
933,are lots more already stacked up. The Doctor and Jamie are watching
934,from behind a wall.) 
935,DOCTOR: That's incredible! 
936,JAMIE: What? 
937,DOCTOR: The ease with which that man carried that crate. 
938,JAMIE: Probably empty. 
939,DOCTOR: Let's go and see. 
940,(But their combined efforts do not move it.) 
941,JAMIE: That man must be a superman. 
942,"DOCTOR: It's odd, Jamie, it's distinctly odd. "
943,JAMIE: There's someone coming. 
944,"(They run back behind the wall. The man carries in another container,"
945,puts it down and leaves.) 
946,JAMIE: It's amazing. 
947,DOCTOR: Yes. 
948,"JAMIE: Come on, let's find Zoe and Isobel and get out of here. These"
949,fellows are giving me the creeps. 
950,DOCTOR: Yes.

952,[Vaughn's office]
953,
954,(The intercom is beeping.) 
955,VAUGHN: Yes? 
956,"PACKER [on monitor: They're back again, Mister Vaughn. The Doctor and"
957,the boy. Security eye has picked them up in the warehouse. 
958,"VAUGHN: That's rather unfortunate for them, isn't it, Packer? "
959,"PACKER : Shall I put a full security alert on, sir? VAUGHN:"
960,"No, Packer. We don't want to frighten them off, do we? Just close off"
961,the area and we'll flush them out. Have you dealt with the two young
962,ladies yet? 
963,"PACKER : No, sir. I was about to when this new alert"
964,happened. 
965,VAUGHN: How fortunate. We need a sprat to catch our mackerel. Take them
966,down to the warehouse area.
967,
968,[Warehouse]
969,
970," JAMIE: This place is like a maze. Doctor, I think"
971,we're lost. 
972,DOCTOR: There must be a door to the main building somewhere. 
973,(Screams.) 
974,JAMIE: Zoe and Isobel! Come on. 
975,(Two warehousemen in overalls carry the unconscious Zoe and Isobel up
976,to a container.) 
977,PACKER: Right. Put them inside. 
978,(The container lid is shut with a piece of feather boa sticking out.) 
979,PACKER: Load it onto the return van. 
980,JAMIE: Come on! 
981,"DOCTOR: No, Jamie. Wait. "
982,(Jamie tackles Packer from behind.) 
983,PACKER: Guards! Guards! 
984,DOCTOR: The guards! Come on. 
985,"(The Doctor and Jamie run round walls, but they are cornered by armed"
986,"guards and brought back to Packer, who draws his pistol.) "
987,PACKER: Like rats in a trap.

991,
992,"PACKER: You really don't learn, do you? This is"
993,private property. A restricted area. 
994,JAMIE: Where's Zoe? Where have you taken her?! 
995,PACKER: Be quiet! 
996,"JAMIE: Look, we heard them scream. If you've hurt her "
997,PACKER: I said be quiet! 
998,(Jamie lunges at Packer and gets thrown off into a wall.) 
999,VAUGHN: Packer! You really must try and control this violent streak in
1000,"your nature, Packer. Although I must admit the situation is provoking. "
1001,"So here you are again. You really are beginning to try our patience,"
1002,you know. 
1003,JAMIE: And he's beginning to try mine. 
1004,"DOCTOR: Jamie, Jamie. We came here looking for two friends of ours. "
1005,VAUGHN: Two young ladies? Yes. 
1006,JAMIE: So he admits that they're here. 
1007,VAUGHN: Correction. They were. It would seem that you've been chasing
1008,each other's tails. They came here looking for you. 
1009,DOCTOR: Where are they now? 
1010,"VAUGHN: Why, they left, of course. "
1011,"JAMIE: Aye, carted off by two of your thugs in a box. "
1012,VAUGHN: Oh really. 
1013,"JAMIE: Look, it's true. We heard them scream and I saw some of Zoe's"
1014,clothes trapped in the lid. 
1015,"VAUGHN: You really do have a very fertile imagination, young man. "
1016,"JAMIE: Now listen you, I'm telling I definitely saw those "
1017,"DOCTOR: Jamie, Jamie. It would set our minds at rest if we could take a"
1018,look inside those boxes. 
1019,"VAUGHN: Then you shall. Packer, I presume the only crates going out of"
1020,here are the empty ones being returned to the factory? 
1021,"PACKER: Yes, sir. They're loading now, sir. "
1022,VAUGHN: Then you shall inspect them at your leisure. After you. 
1023,DOCTOR: How kind. 
1024,"(The Doctor, Jamie and the guards leave. Vaughn gestures to Packer and"
1025,leaves. Packer speaks into his wrist communicator.) 
1026,PACKER: This is Packer. Get the return van moving immediately. Do you
1027,understand? I said immediately!
1028,
1029,[Outside the warehouse]
1030,
1031,(The freight train rattles off down the line.) 
1032,"VAUGHN: Ah, just too late, I'm afraid. Such a pity. Still, all is not"
1033,lost. I am myself going down to the factory today. Would you care to
1034,join me? We can meet the train on its arrival. 
1035,"DOCTOR: Well, that's very civil of you. "
1036,VAUGHN: My pleasure. 
1037,[Aeroplane]
1038,
1039,BRIGADIER: How long ago did they go in? 
1040,"BENTON : Some time ago, sir. Tracy followed them as far as the"
1041,official boundaries of the railway sidings. They went in about an hour
1042,ago. 
1043,BRIGADIER: Is Tracy still round there? 
1044,BENTON : Yes sir. 
1045,"BRIGADIER: Right, stick around for a while. "
1046,"BENTON : Just a minute, sir. "
1047,"BRIGADIER: Yes, what is it, Benton? "
1048,"BENTON : The Doctor and the boy. They're coming out, sir, with"
1049,Vaughn. 
1050,"(Jamie gets into the Rolls through the door held open by the chauffeur,"
1051,then out the other side and into the passenger seat just before Packer
1052,got to it.) 
1053,"BRIGADIER: Benton, what's happening? What's happening? "
1054,"BENTON : Oh, sorry, sir. Nothing really, they've all got into"
1055,"Vaughn's private car. Oh, they're driving off, sir. "
1056,BRIGADIER: Is any force being used? 
1057,"BENTON : No, not that I can see. Packer was there but it looked"
1058,very friendly to me. Shall we follow? 
1059,"BRIGADIER: No, I'll have them tracked more discretely. Over and out."
1060,Sergeant Walters. 
1061,WALTERS: Yes sir? 
1062,BRIGADIER: Alert all area patrols in section three. 
1063,"WALTERS: Yes, sir. "
1064,"BRIGADIER: Did you hear all that, Jimmy? "
1065,"WALTERS: I did, sir. "
1066,"BRIGADIER: Look, we'll get you aboard a chopper and you can rendezvous"
1067,with the tracking agent. 
1068,"WALTERS: All right, sir. Are they any specific instructions? "
1069,"BRIGADIER: No, we're playing a bit by ear for the moment, so try and"
1070,"keep out of trouble. Should the Doctor contract us for help, I'll have"
1071,his signal relayed straight to you. 
1072,"WALTERS: Right, sir. "
1073,(The Rolls is admitted into the IE compound. The guards look up at the
1074,sound of rotors overhead.)
1075,
1076,[Helicopter]
1077,
1078,"TURNER: They've just gone into the IE area, sir."
1079,Shall I follow?
1080,
1081,[Aeroplane]
1082,
1083,"BRIGADIER: No, circle the area. We can't really do"
1084,anything until we get a request from the Doctor. 
1085,"TURNER : Standing by, sir. "
1086,BRIGADIER: And Jimmy? Keep out of sight. If Vaughn's private army see
1087,you they might well get the wind up and that might make things rather
1088,unhealthy for the Doctor and the boy. Over and out. 
1089,[Lift]
1090,
1091,(The guards present arms to Vaughn when they arrive
1092,at the building and go in. They walk along a narrow corridor and into a
1093,lift.) 
1094,"JAMIE: Hey, what's happening? I thought we were looking for Zoe and"
1095,Isobel. 
1096,"VAUGHN: All in good time, young man. The train and the empty crate car"
1097,will take some time to get here. In the meantime I'd rather like to
1098,talk to you. 
1099,DOCTOR: Oh. really? 
1100,"VAUGHN: Yes. Those circuits you gave me, they're rather fascinating. I"
1101,like to know more about them. 
1102,(The lift arrives at its destination.) 
1103,[Corridor]
1104,
1105,VAUGHN: This way gentleman. 
1106,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
1107,(The Doctor and Jamie walk ahead.) 
1108,VAUGHN: Packer. Be a good fellow and see if Professor Watkins is
1109,"finished, will you? "
1110,"PACKER: Very good, Mister Vaughn. "
1111,"VAUGHN: You might offer him a little encouragement. Coming, gentlemen. "
1112,(Packer heads down to floor three with a big grin on his face.)
1113,
1114, [Vaughn's office]
1115,
1116,"JAMIE: Hey! Doctor, it's "
1117,"VAUGHN: Confusing, isn't it? "
1118,JAMIE: It's exactly the same as your office in London. 
1119,"VAUGHN: In all basic essentials, yes, it is. That's the secret of my"
1120,"success, you see. Uniformity, duplication. My whole empire is based on"
1121,that principle. The very essence of business efficiency. Do sit down. 
1122,"DOCTOR: Oh, how kind. "
1123,VAUGHN: I must say I'm rather glad we have this opportunity to talk. 
1124,DOCTOR: Really? 
1125,"VAUGHN: I should, of course, be angry with you. You've thwarted my"
1126,elaborate security precautions twice. I'd like to know why. 
1127,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's quite simple. I hate computers and refuse to be"
1128,bullied by them. 
1129,VAUGHN: Your young friend Zoe. 
1130,"JAMIE: Well, what about her? "
1131,VAUGHN: She appears to have the same instincts. She so confused one of
1132,my computers she ruined its memory store. 
1133,JAMIE: So that's why your thugs dragged her and Isobel away. 
1134,"VAUGHN: My dear young man, I wasn't angry with her. On the contrary I"
1135,"found the incident quite amusing. She's a remarkable girl. And you,"
1136,"Doctor, are obviously a man of no mean scientific ability. "
1137,DOCTOR: Why do you say that? 
1138,"VAUGHN: Oh, my research department found these quite fascinating."
1139,There's a totally illogical factor in their construction. Are they of
1140,your own invention? 
1141,"Ah, you're determined to guard your secret, I see. I don't blame you,"
1142,"and I promise not to pry any more. In fact, I'll do all I can to help"
1143,you. 
1144,"DOCTOR: Oh, how kind. "
1145,VAUGHN: Now you say you came here looking for Professor Watkins because
1146,you thought he might be able to help you. 
1147,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1148,"VAUGHN: Then I'll try to persuade him to put aside his work and er,"
1149,concentrate his efforts on your behalf. Make yourself at home. 
1150,(Vaughn leaves.) 
1151,"JAMIE: Hey, look, you're not going to trust him, are you? I mean, what"
1152,about Zoe and Isobel? 
1153,"DOCTOR: I haven't forgotten them, Jamie. "
1154,"JAMIE: They're in that box, I'm sure of it. "
1155,"DOCTOR: Jamie, we're not going to help Zoe by annoying Mister Vaughn,"
1156,are we? 
1157,JAMIE: I don't think you could annoy that man even if you want to. He's
1158,being as nice as pie. 
1159,DOCTOR: He's too nice. 
1160,"JAMIE: Aye, but why should he be? "
1161,DOCTOR: I don't know. He was a little bit too interested in these
1162,circuits for my liking. 
1163,"JAMIE: Hey, do you think he knows about the Tardis then? "
1164,"DOCTOR: Well, I don't see how he could do. "
1165,"JAMIE: No, well, perhaps this Professor Watkins will be able to tell us"
1166,what's going on around here. 
1167,"DOCTOR: Yes, but that's what worrying me. "
1168,JAMIE: What? 
1169,"DOCTOR: Well, if Vaughn has anything to hide, why is he letting us talk"
1170,to Watkins?
1171,
1172,[Laboratory]
1173,
1174,"PACKER: I'd think about it if I was you, Professor."
1175,"After all, she's a pretty girl. It'll be a shame to spoil all that. "
1176,"WATKINS: What a vicious sadist, you are, Packer. I don't believe you"
1177,anyway. 
1178,"PACKER: I don't make idle threats, Professor, as you well know. If you"
1179,want to see that girl again in one piece I suggest you do as Mister
1180,Vaughn asks. 
1181,WATKINS: How do I know that you already haven't harmed her. If you have
1182,got her 
1183,"VAUGHN: You can take my word for that, Professor. "
1184,WATKINS: Your word. I know how much I can value I can place on that. 
1185,"VAUGHN: Harsh words, Professor, harsh words. Any progress? So, you"
1186,haven't yet completed the machine? 
1187,"WATKINS: No, and I don't intend to. "
1188,"VAUGHN: Oh I think you will, Professor. Much as I detest violence, I"
1189,"find it difficult to restrain Packer's er, indisputable talent for"
1190,"persuasion. Your niece is in our custody, and unless you do as I ask, I"
1191,shall hand her over to Packer. The choice is yours. 
1192,"WATKINS: If I do cooperate, will you let her go? "
1193,"VAUGHN: Oh no, she's our guarantee. But she'll come to no harm. "
1194,WATKINS: All right. But I must see Isobel first. 
1195,"VAUGHN: Of course. Oh, there is just one other thing. Don't look at me"
1196,"so suspiciously, my dear Professor. It's merely that there are some"
1197,friends of yours here that wish to see you. 
1198,WATKINS: Friends? 
1199,"VAUGHN: Yes, they're going to great pains to seek you out. "
1200,WATKINS: But I haven't been allowed visitors since I came here. Why are
1201,you suddenly considerate? I might tell them everything. 
1202,"VAUGHN: Everything? My dear Professor, you know nothing that can harm"
1203,"me. Besides, there's always Isobel to consider, isn't there? "
1204,PACKER: Or would you rather leave her to me? 
1205,"VAUGHN: Now, now, Packer. The Professor's going to do exactly as we"
1206,"ask, aren't you? "
1207, [Vaughn's office]
1208,
1209,(The Doctor and Jamie are looking out of the
1210,picture window.) 
1211,"JAMIE: There, you see? "
1212,"DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, I can see. Let's have a closer look at that, shall"
1213,we? 
1214,(The Doctor uses Jamie as a support for his telescope.) 
1215,DOCTOR: Now just hold still a minute. Keep your shoulder still. That's
1216,odd. That's very odd. 
1217,JAMIE: What is it? 
1218,"(It looks like Fylingdale, which is a neat trick from near London."
1219,Sadly those golf balls no longer exist.) 
1220,"DOCTOR: Well, it looks like a deep space radio communication system."
1221,What's it's doing here? 
1222,"JAMIE: Don't ask me, you're the brains. Hey look, a helicopter. Could"
1223,it be the Brigadier's lot. 
1224,"DOCTOR: Yes, it could be. "
1225,JAMIE: Shush. There's someone coming. 
1226,(Packer enters.) 
1227,PACKER: Come along. 
1228,[Aeroplane]
1229,
1230,"WALTERS: Hold on, sir, he's just here. Sir, it's"
1231,Captain Turner. 
1232,"BRIGADIER: Yes, Jimmy, any news? "
1233,"TURNER : No, sir. Not a sign of them. "
1234,"BRIGADIER: Right, stay in the area. We daren't make a move until we"
1235,hear from the Doctor. Over and out.
1236,
1237,[Laboratory]
1238,
1239,"WATKINS: Yes, of course, I remember Anne Travers"
1240,"telling me about you. She was a student of mine, you know, some years"
1241,"ago. Brilliant girl, brilliant. "
1242,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, they went to America, didn't they? "
1243,"WATKINS: Oh, Travers was getting past it a bit, you know, and Anne"
1244,persuaded him to go to America with her. 
1245,DOCTOR: Oh yes. 
1246,WATKINS: What are you doing here? 
1247,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a long story."
1248,
1249, [Vaughn's office]
1250,
1251,VAUGHN: This strange Doctor's been on another
1252,"planet, Packer. "
1253,PACKER: That's not possible. 
1254,"VAUGHN: It is a fact, Packer. He has some sort of machine. Now let's"
1255,"see if we can learn more about it, shall we? Switch on, Packer. With"
1256,sound. 
1257,DOCTOR : So we went to see Mister Vaughn. He said that you
1258,were working on something important. 
1259,PACKER: I see. That's why you want to leave them alone together. 
1260,"VAUGHN: Exactly, Packer."
1261,
1262,[Laboratory]
1263,
1264,JAMIE: But the Doctor needed some help on some
1265,electronic circuits that the Tardis needed. 
1266,WATKINS: Really? 
1267,"JAMIE: Aye, aye. "
1268,(An eye device in a wall moves.) 
1269,"DOCTOR: Jamie, Jamie, I don't think the Professor wants to hear about"
1270,that. 
1271,"WATKINS: On the contrary, what Anne told me about the Tardis was most"
1272,intriguing. I'd like to hear a lot more about it. 
1273,"DOCTOR: Professor, I think that I should warn you that Anne Travers"
1274,allowed her imagination to run a little wild. 
1275,WATKINS: You mean to say there is no such machine? 
1276,JAMIE: Of course there is. 
1277,"DOCTOR: Jamie, I think that there are other more important things to"
1278,talk about at the moment. 
1279,(The Doctor has gone to one side of the equipment rack and is pointing
1280,at the not very hidden camera.) 
1281,"JAMIE: Oh, I see, yes. "
1282,"DOCTOR: Professor, tell us about what you're doing here. "
1283,"WATKINS: Oh, it's very simple, really. I've been developing a new kind"
1284,of teaching machine. 
1285,DOCTOR: Oh yes? A teaching machine? 
1286,JAMIE: What's it called? 
1287,WATKINS: I call it the Cerebraton Mentor. 
1288,"JAMIE: Oh, aye? "
1289,WATKINS: The main difference from the other teaching machines is that
1290,it is able to induce emotional changes in the subject. 
1291,JAMIE: Oh. 
1292,(The Doctor puts a small magnet on the camera.)
1293,
1294, [Vaughn's office]
1295,
1296,(The picture is replaced by static.) 
1297,PACKER: Has it broken down? 
1298,VAUGHN: Let's check. 
1299,(Vaughn switches to other cameras around the compound.) 
1300,VAUGHN: All the other monitors are functioning. 
1301,PACKER: Yeah? 
1302,VAUGHN: Our friend the Doctor's a resourceful man. No wonder our allies
1303,fear him. 
1304,PACKER: Our allies know him? 
1305,"VAUGHN: Oh, yes. I was ordered to destroy him. But first I must learn"
1306,the secrets of this extraordinary machine of his. 
1307,PACKER: If you're been ordered to destroy him 
1308,"VAUGHN: I don't take orders, Packer, I give them! Now, I think the time"
1309,has come to stop playing games with this Doctor! 
1310,[Laboratory]
1311,
1312,"WATKINS: But what can we do? If, as you say, they"
1313,have Isobel and your young friend then we're entirely at their mercy. 
1314,"DOCTOR: No, no, not entirely. There's my friend the Brigadier,"
1315,remember. 
1316,WATKINS: Do you think he can help us? 
1317,"DOCTOR: Possibly. But quickly, tell me, what is Vaughn up to? What's he"
1318,doing here? 
1319,"WATKINS: I know no more than you do. He's a ruthless man, without"
1320,"morals or principles. His object, I'm sure, is to get complete control"
1321,of the electronics industry of the world! 
1322,DOCTOR: I wonder. I've a nasty feeling he's aiming somewhat higher than
1323,that. 
1324,(Jamie is listening at the door.) 
1325,"JAMIE: Doctor, quick, somebody's coming. "
1326,(Vaughn enters.) 
1327,"VAUGHN: Don't bother, Doctor. Allow me. Very ingenious. A simple"
1328,magnet. I congratulate you. 
1329,"DOCTOR: Oh, how kind. "
1330,VAUGHN: However you must surely realise that it's forced me to consider
1331,other methods to make you talk. 
1332,JAMIE: What are you going to do? 
1333,VAUGHN: Your friend Zoe is due to arrive here shortly. 
1334,"JAMIE: So you have got her! Listen, if you've harmed her in any way "
1335,"VAUGHN: You may still be adolescent enough to make idle threats, young"
1336,"man, but I can assure you, I am not. I want your travel machine,"
1337,Doctor. Otherwise I shall hand your friend Zoe over to Packer. It's a
1338,simple choice and shouldn't take you longer than an hour to consider.
1339,"Take them away, Packer. "
1340,(The guards manhandle the Doctor and Jamie out of the room.)
1341,DOCTOR: All right. 
1342,JAMIE: All right. 
1343,PACKER: Leave them to me. I'll take them. 
1344,(Packer leaves.) 
1345,"VAUGHN: Now, Professor, I suggest you continue with your work."
1346,
1347,[Corridor]
1348,
1349,"DOCTOR: Oh dear. You know, Jamie, I've always been"
1350,rather scared of lifts. 
1351,JAMIE: Why? 
1352,DOCTOR: I never even like to start them. You'll have to push the
1353,button. 
1354,JAMIE: Me? 
1355,PACKER: Keep your mouth shut and do as you're told. 
1356,"DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie. Do as you're told. "
1357,"JAMIE: Oh yes, I see "
1358,PACKER: Be quiet! 
1359,(Jamie steps into the lift.) 
1360,"DOCTOR: Packer! Mister Packer, I obviously can't let you hurt Zoe, and"
1361,"so I'll have to tell you all want to know, now. "
1362,"PACKER: You mean, you're willing to talk? "
1363,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sure that Mister Vaughn will. Oh, there he is now. "
1364,"(Packer turns, the Doctor pushes him away.) "
1365,"JAMIE: Quick, Doctor! "
1366,(The Doctor gets into the lift with Jamie and the doors close.)

1369,
1370,DOCTOR: Your knife. 
1371,JAMIE: Eh? 
1372,DOCTOR: Your knife. Give me your knife. 
1373,JAMIE: What are you going to do? 
1374,DOCTOR: I'm going to try and break the circuit. 
1375,JAMIE: What will that do? 
1376,"DOCTOR: It will either stop the lift, or send us out of control. "
1377,JAMIE: But we're six floors up. 
1378,"DOCTOR: We'll have to take that risk. Hold tight, here we go. "
1379,(The Doctor pulls the wires in the panel and there's a bang.)
1380,
1381, [Vaughn's office]
1382,
1383,"VAUGHN: Why are you so gullible, Packer? "
1384,PACKER: Just wait till I get hold of them. I'll 
1385,VAUGHN: You'll do nothing! I want them in one piece. 
1386,(Packer's wrist communicator buzzes.) 
1387,"PACKER: Packer here. Have you got them? Well, what happened? Stuck?"
1388,"How? Well, get on with it, man! The lift is struck between the fourth"
1389,and fifth floors. 
1390,"VAUGHN: So I gathered, Packer. "
1391,"PACKER: Well, it's obviously a mechanical fault. Wait a minute. He did"
1392,it! 
1393,"VAUGHN: Yes, Packer. Our clever Doctor has outwitted you. Oh, then that"
1394,"wouldn't be too difficult, would it? "
1395,"PACKER: Well, it won't do him much good, will it? After all, he can't"
1396,"get anywhere, can he? "
1397,"VAUGHN: No, but then why do it? He might be playing for time, but I"
1398,doubt it.
1399,
1400,[Lift]
1401,
1402,"DOCTOR: There was a fifty-fifty chance, you know,"
1403,Jamie. 
1404,"JAMIE: Yes, but what good has it done us. I mean, we're stuck here in"
1405,this lift now. 
1406,"DOCTOR: No, no, it's the lift that's stuck, not us. Look. "
1407,(The Doctor points out the emergency exit in the roof.) 
1408,"JAMIE: Hey, where does that lead to? "
1409,"DOCTOR: Out into the lift shaft, I imagine. Quickly, on me back. "
1410,JAMIE: You know something? You're a clever wee chappie. 
1411,DOCTOR: Jamie.
1412,
1413,[Corridor]
1414,
1415,PACKER: (into comm.) Switch over to the emergency
1416,circuits. I want that lift operational in three minutes! (to guards) I
1417,want all lift exits covered. I want a man on each floor. Move! 
1418,(The guards leave quickly.) 
1419,"VAUGHN: Don't panic, Packer. Our birds can't fly away."
1420,
1421,[Lift shaft]
1422,
1423,(Jamie and the Doctor climb onto the roof of the
1424,lift and look up the access ladder.) 
1425,"DOCTOR: Thank you, Jamie. Oh my word! Well, that's a long way up, isn't"
1426,"it? Oh well, we'd better get cracking before they realise what's"
1427,happened. Perhaps I'd better shut this. 
1428,JAMIE: Aye. 
1429,(The Doctor closes the lift hatch.) 
1430,"JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, I've just been thinking. What happens if they get"
1431,the lift going before we get to the top? 
1432,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's simple. "
1433,JAMIE: What? 
1434,DOCTOR: We get squashed. 
1435,"JAMIE: What! Well, come on! "
1436,[Corridor]
1437,
1438,PACKER: Right. They've switched over the circuits.
1439,The lift's working. 
1440,VAUGHN: How splendid. Bring it up here. 
1441,PACKER: Bring it up to the sixth floor.
1442,
1443,[Lift shaft]
1444,
1445,"JAMIE: Hey, that's not what I think it is, is it? "
1446,DOCTOR: I'm very much afraid it is. Come on! 
1447,JAMIE: We'll never make it! 
1448,"DOCTOR: Yes, we will! Come on! "
1449,(The lift stops.) 
1450,JAMIE: What's happened? 
1451,"DOCTOR: It's stopped. They must be checking. Come on, they may guess"
1452,where we are and come after us.
1453,
1454,[Corridor]
1455,
1456,(Packer looks inside the lift.) 
1457,PACKER: They've vanished! They just vanished! 
1458,VAUGHN: Check the other floors! 
1459,PACKER: This is Packer. Check all the lift exits and get me the
1460,engineer. Hello? Yes? Did the lift stop at any other floors on the way
1461,"up? You're certain? Right, the engineer's certain. "
1462,"VAUGHN: The shaft terminates in the roof, doesn't it, Packer? "
1463,"PACKER: Yes, sir. "
1464,VAUGHN: Why didn't you think of that? 
1465,PACKER: I'll get them. 
1466,"VAUGHN: Call me when you do, Packer. I'll be in my office. And please"
1467,"don't fail this time, there's a good fellow. "
1468,(Vaughn leaves.) 
1469,PACKER: This is Packer. Get some men on the roof. They're still in the
1470,lift shaft. No! Don't take the lift. Those two might still be in.
1471,"(pause) Hey, wait a minute. I'll take the lift. Tell the engineer to"
1472,take it right to the top. 
1473,[Lift shaft]
1474,
1475,(The Doctor and Jamie climb past a panel
1476,proclaiming Kilroy Was Here!.) 
1477,"JAMIE: Only another floor, Doctor. They've started it again! "
1478,"DOCTOR: Hurry, Jamie! Hurry! "
1479,[Rooftop]
1480,
1481,(The Doctor and Jamie crawl exhausted out of the
1482,lift service door.) 
1483,"DOCTOR: Come on, Jamie. "
1484,"JAMIE: Wait a minute, Doctor. "
1485,"DOCTOR: No, come on. Let's see where we are. "
1486,(The Doctor looks over the edge of the building.) 
1487,JAMIE: Now where? 
1488,DOCTOR: Down there. 
1489,JAMIE: Oh no! 
1490,"DOCTOR: Well, we can't go down the lift again, can we? Hello. There's a"
1491,fire escape. Come on. 
1492, [Vaughn's office]
1493,
1494,"VAUGHN: Oh, Packer, you do disappoint me. "
1495,"PACKER: They must have got down the fire escape, sir. "
1496,"VAUGHN: And, of course, you didn't think to have a guard on that! "
1497,"PACKER: Well, normally "
1498,VAUGHN: You're a stupid incompetent! I want that Doctor! Put the whole
1499,"compound on alert! Have every available guard on the job! Find him,"
1500,Packer! Find him!
1501,
1502,[Freight wagon]
1503,
1504,(The Doctor and Jamie hide between two carriages as
1505,"a guard passes by and an alarm sounds, then climb up into an IE marked"
1506,freight wagon and close the door.) 
1507,"JAMIE: Hey, Doctor. Do you think that this is the train that Zoe and"
1508,Isobel came on? 
1509,DOCTOR: It could be. 
1510,"JAMIE: Vaughn said that one had empty crates on it, didn't he? "
1511,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1512,"JAMIE: Well, we'll soon see. Let's look inside. "
1513,(They open a crate. It contains some muslin-like material.) 
1514,"JAMIE: Oh no, these are full. "
1515,PACKER : I want all these trains searched from top to bottom! Move!
1516,
1517,"DOCTOR: Jamie! Hide! Quickly, hide! "
1518,(The Doctor goes out of sight and Jamie gets into the crate they just
1519,opened.)
1520,
1521,[Crate]
1522,
1523,"PACKER : You two, search this one. "
1524,(Jamie looks on in horror as the material next to him moves.)

1528,
1529,"(Alarms blaring, Packer and his guards look into"
1530,"the wagon, then close the door and move on. The Doctor and Jamie come"
1531,out of their hiding places.) 
1532,DOCTOR: Jamie. Jamie! 
1533,"JAMIE: Doctor, I think "
1534,DOCTOR: Shush. 
1535,JAMIE: But Doctor 
1536,DOCTOR: I think the guards are still out there. 
1537,JAMIE: Doctor 
1538,DOCTOR: Keep your voice down. 
1539,"JAMIE: That thing in there, it moved. In the crate, there's something"
1540,alive in there. 
1541,"DOCTOR: Alive? Jamie, the darkness plays funny tricks with the"
1542,imagination. 
1543,"JAMIE: Look, it moved, I tell you. "
1544,DOCTOR: Are you sure? 
1545,JAMIE: Positive. 
1546,"DOCTOR: All right, let's have a closer look. "
1547,GUARD : You two! Over here! Get those two girls over the Main
1548,Administration Building! Move! 
1549,JAMIE: Zoe and Isobel. 
1550,DOCTOR: Wait. We'll follow in a few moments.
1551,
1552, [Vaughn's office]
1553,
1554,"PACKER: The whole compound's under alert, Mister"
1555,Vaughn. 
1556,VAUGHN: And? 
1557,"PACKER: Well, er "
1558,VAUGHN: You haven't yet found them. 
1559,PACKER: Well it's only a matter of time. 
1560,"VAUGHN: Is it? I doubt it, Packer. This Doctor's far too clever a fish"
1561,for you to net. 
1562,"PACKER: Well, if you'd let me take care of them properly in the first"
1563,"place and obeyed the orders of our allies, you might "
1564,"VAUGHN: Orders? Me, Packer? I told them and I'll tell you. I give"
1565,"orders, not take them. "
1566,PACKER: You told them that? 
1567,"VAUGHN: The invasion's under my control, and when our purpose has been"
1568,achieved I shall still be in control. 
1569,PACKER: You can't fight them. 
1570,VAUGHN: Packer. Why do you think I kept that old fool Watkins alive. 
1571,"PACKER: Well, to work on his machine of course. "
1572,VAUGHN: And why did you think I wanted him to do that? 
1573,"PACKER: Well, you. I don't know. "
1574,VAUGHN: Our allies appear to find the Professor's machine somewhat
1575,"disturbing, so much so in fact that when they saw the prototype they"
1576,ordered us to destroy it and all similar machines. 
1577,PACKER: You mean they're frightened of it? 
1578,"VAUGHN: The teaching power of the machine didn't worry them, but when I"
1579,"generated some emotion pulses. I'm convinced, Packer, that emotion"
1580,could be used to destroy them. 
1581,PACKER: That's only a guess. 
1582,"VAUGHN: A gamble, Packer, a reasonable gamble, and after all we are"
1583,"playing this game for very high stakes, are we not? "
1584,"PACKER: Well, I think you're taking too big a chance. "
1585,VAUGHN: Do you wish to be totally converted? Would you prefer to be one
1586,of them? Completely inhuman? 
1587,"PACKER: Oh, no! But "
1588,VAUGHN: That's what'll happen if they take over. We will cease to be
1589,"human. So, we must use their force and their might and then discard"
1590,them. 
1591,PACKER: And you're sure that this machine can do it? 
1592,"VAUGHN: Even if we fail, we could escape. The Doctor. We must secure"
1593,this spacecraft of his. 
1594,"PACKER: Oh yeah, I see. Insurance. "
1595,"VAUGHN: Exactly, Packer. The two young ladies have arrived, I hope? "
1596,"PACKER: Yes, sir, they're under guard. "
1597,VAUGHN: Good. 
1598,PACKER: They're being taken over to the Main Administration Building
1599,"now, sir. "
1600,"VAUGHN: When they're safely tucked away, we'll flush out our clever"
1601,Doctor.

1606,into the building. One has a piece of feather boa sticking out.) 
1607,"PACKER: Take them inside. Central block, tenth floor. "
1608,(The sound of a helicopter nearby.) 
1609,JAMIE: Could be the Brigadier's lot. Call them up for help! 
1610,"DOCTOR: No, no, not yet. We've got to rescue the girls first. Tenth"
1611,"floor, central block. Come on. "
1612,[Helicopter]
1613,
1614,"TURNER: There's a lot of unusual activity, sir."

1616,BRIGADIER : Any sign of the Doctor and the boy? 
1617,"TURNER: No, sir. None at all. "
1618,"BRIGADIER: Right, Jimmy. Get out of the area and stand by. "
1619,"TURNER: Right, sir. Will do. "

1622,"BRIGADIER: All units, please, Sergeant. "
1623,"WALTERS: Yes, sir. Go ahead, sir. "

1630,"PACKER: Yes, sir and two of the outer perimeter guard posts reported"
1631,"seeing strangers in the area outside, sir. "
1632,VAUGHN: I see. 
1633,"PACKER: I think this Doctor's with the UNIT organisation. Well, what"
1634,are we going to do? 
1635,VAUGHN: Nothing. 
1636,PACKER: Nothing? But they 
1637,"VAUGHN: They can't harm us, Packer. We're in control. Or at least I am."
1638,Leave this to me.

1644,JAMIE: What's that? 
1645,"DOCTOR: I should think that's the central block, wouldn't you, Jamie? "
1646,JAMIE: How do we find out which room they're in? And when we have how
1647,do we get them out? 
1648,"DOCTOR: Stop looking for problems, Jamie. Let's get along up there,"
1649,shall we? 
1650,(An announcement comes over the compound tannoys.) 
1651,"VAUGHN : Doctor. If you can hear me, listen. You have ten minutes,"
1652,Doctor. Ten minutes to relinquish your freedom. At the end of that
1653,"time, your young friend Zoe will pay the consequences of your foolish"
1654,"and totally pointless opposition. Ten minutes, Doctor, ten minutes. "
1655,JAMIE: There's not much time. 
1656,DOCTOR: There's just about time enough to effect a simple rescue
1657,"operation. Come along, Jamie."
1658,JAMIE: Simple? 
1659,"DOCTOR: Yes, come along."

1664,"ISOBEL: Oh, let us out of here, you stupid, idiotic. Oh, why have they"
1665,brought us here? 
1666,"ZOE: I suppose because I ruined that stupid computer of theirs. Well,"
1667,I'm sorry. 
1668,ISOBEL: But why kidnap us? Why don't they just turn us over to the
1669,police or something? 
1670,"ZOE: I don't know. Anyway, we've got to get out of here. "

1680,(The Doctor gestures the girls to keep quiet and move back.)
1681,
1682,[Room]
1683,
1684,ISOBEL: It looked as if they were trying to tell us
1685,something. 
1686,ZOE: The Doctor wants us to keep away from the window for some reason. 
1687,ISOBEL: I wonder why? 
1688,"ZOE: Well, I'm not sure. "
1689,(Zoe spots the surveillance camera.)

1697,a few moments. 
1698,BRIGADIER: Why? Are you in trouble? 
1699,"DOCTOR : No, but we shall need help. You have a helicopter in the"
1700,area? 
1701,BRIGADIER: Yes. 
1702,"DOCTOR : I wonder, have they a rope ladder on board. "
1703,"BRIGADIER: Yes, I pretty sure they have. Where are you? "
1704,DOCTOR : We're just going up to the roof of the main building. That
1705,is the central block on the north side. That should give your
1706,helicopter cover should there be any ground fire. Have you got that? 
1707,"BRIGADIER: Yes, I've got that. Over and out."

1715,"little friends. Doctor, you have five minutes. Five minutes. "
1716,PACKER: They won't give themselves up. They'd be mad to. 
1717,(Vaughn goes to the window and looks at the helicopter crossing the
1718,compound boundary.) 
1719,"VAUGHN: Not mad Packer, merely human. "
1720,PACKER: It's the same one! The same helicopter. 
1721,"VAUGHN: Yes. Perhaps they do mean to save their own skins, after all."
1722,Probably the helicopter's trying to pick them up. Stop them! Shoot it
1723,down if necessary!

1733,"DOCTOR: No, no, of course not. Help me to get this over the side there."
1734,
1735,"(They drop the rest of the ladder down the building, across the window"
1736,to Zoe and Isobel's prison.) 
1737,"DOCTOR: Right. Down you go, Jamie. "

1757,"Get going. Come on, now. Watch yourself. Easy. "
1758,(Zoe climbs out of the window and starts up the ladder.)

1795,"DOCTOR: Get us out of here! Hold on, Jamie! "

1797,climbs onboard.)

1801,(Gunfire is heard over the RT.) 
1802,"BRIGADIER: Jimmy! What's happening, Jimmy? Do you want ground support? "
1803,"TURNER : Hello, sir. No, mission accomplished. On our way back now."
1804,
1805,BRIGADIER: Splendid. No casualties? 
1806,"TURNER : No, sir. All well. Fortunately Vaughn's jackboots couldn't"
1807,shoot a flying elephant. Over and out. 
1808,"BRIGADIER: All units, please, Sergeant. "
1809,"WALTERS: Yes, sir. Go ahead, sir. "
1810,"BRIGADIER: All UNIT groups. Red alert cancelled. I say again, Red alert"
1811,cancelled. Return to base.
1812,
1813, [Vaughn's office]
1814,
1815,PACKER: That helicopter was one of the UNIT force
1816,group. I told you. 
1817,"VAUGHN: Don't panic, Packer. You've blundered again, but fortunately it"
1818,won't really matter. 
1819,PACKER: Matter? There's bound to be an official reaction. 
1820,"VAUGHN: There will be no official reaction. I've told you, we are in"
1821,command. 
1822,PACKER: But 
1823,"VAUGHN: Don't argue, Packer! Just do as you're told, man! And for once,"
1824,do it right! 
1825,"PACKER: Yes, sir. "
1826,"VAUGHN: Now, I want Professor Watkins' Cerebraton machine loaded into"
1827,my car. We're going back to London. 
1828,"PACKER: Back to London, sir? But you can't go back "
1829,"VAUGHN: Due to your clumsiness, Packer, we must now alter our plans. I"
1830,intend to bring the invasion forward. We have twenty four hours to
1831,prepare for it. 
1832,PACKER: Twenty four hours? But they'll never agree to it. The invasion
1833,"forces aren't anywhere near complete, sir. "
1834,VAUGHN: They'll be sufficient for our immediate purpose. After the
1835,"invasion, we'll no longer have no need for secrecy. Now, you attend to"
1836,the Professor and I'll deal with our UNIT friends. Bring Watkins up
1837,here to me when you're ready. 
1838,"PACKER: Yes, sir. "
1839,(Packer leaves. Vaughn goes to his intercom.) 
1840,VAUGHN: Get me the Ministry of Defence and switch it through to my
1841,visual circuit. 
1842,SECRETARY : Good morning. Ministry of Defence. Can I help
1843,you? 
1844,"VAUGHN: Yes, get me. Ah, good morning. Major General Rutlidge, please. "
1845,"SECRETARY : Just one moment. Who is calling, please? "
1846,VAUGHN: Tobias Vaughn.

1848,[Rutlidge's office]
1849,
1850,(Rutlidge is already on the telephone.) 
1851,"RUTLIDGE: Fine, sir, fine. We'll meet this evening for dinner, then."
1852,"What? oh, about eight. Yes, at the club. Good. Fine. Goodbye, sir. "
1853,(Rutlidge puts down the handset and it switches to line two.) 
1854,RUTLIDGE: Yes? 
1855,"SECRETARY : Outside call for you, sir. "
1856,RUTLIDGE: Male or female? 
1857,"SECRETARY : It's a Mister Tobias Vaughn, sir. "
1858,RUTLIDGE: Vaughn? 
1859,SECRETARY : Yes sir. Shall I put him through? 
1860,"RUTLIDGE: Vaughn? Yes, yes. "
1861,SECRETARY : Just one moment. 
1862,RUTLIDGE: Operator? 
1863,"SECRETARY : Yes, sir? "
1864,RUTLIDGE: Priority scramble. 
1865,"SECRETARY : Yes, sir. "
1866,(Vaughn's face appears where the dial would normally be on a telephone
1867,set.) 
1868,"VAUGHN : Ah, Rutlidge. Can we be overheard? "
1869,"RUTLIDGE: No, no, no. Priority scramble is in operation. "
1870,VAUGHN : Good. Now listen. Your friends in the UNIT groups
1871,"has been causing trouble. They must be stopped, understand? "
1872,"RUTLIDGE: I, er, I understand. "
1873,VAUGHN : There must be no more interference. 
1874,"RUTLIDGE: No, no. I'll deal with it. "
1875,VAUGHN [on monitor: Good fellow. Knew I could rely on you. 
1876,(Transmission ends.) 
1877,RUTLIDGE: I understand.
1878,
1879,[Aeroplane]
1880,
1881,BRIGADIER: You were lucky. Dead lucky. 
1882,JAMIE: He said that it would be a simple rescue operation. Simple. 
1883,ISOBEL: But what about my uncle? They've still got him prisoner. 
1884,"BRIGADIER: Don't worry, Miss Watkins. As soon we return to base, I'm"
1885,going to raise hell and get some action. 
1886,JAMIE: You think they'll listen to you now? 
1887,"BRIGADIER: No one, not even Tobias Vaughn, can go as far as trying to"
1888,shoot down one of my helicopters. 
1889,"ISOBEL: Oh, I wished I had my camera. I could have got a fortune with"
1890,those pictures. 
1891,"TURNER: Yes, it was a pity. That would have clinched it as far as the"
1892,"Ministry are concerned, sir. "
1893,"BRIGADIER: Don't worry, Jimmy. Billy Rutlidge will have to take some"
1894,action now. 
1895,"JAMIE: Doctor? Hey, Doctor, what's the matter? "
1896,"DOCTOR: Hmm? Jamie, that object on the other side of the moon. "
1897,BRIGADIER: Other side of the? 
1898,"ZOE: Yes. The Tardis went wrong, you see, and we had a sort of, well"
1899,"what, Doctor? A forced landing? "
1900,DOCTOR: Mmm? Yeah. 
1901,ZOE: And then they fired a missile at us. 
1902,BRIGADIER: Who? 
1903,"ZOE: Well, whoever it was who was on that spaceship on the other side"
1904,of the moon. 
1905,BRIGADIER: Spaceships? On the other side of the Moon? 
1906,DOCTOR: And then there was that deep space radio transmitter. I wonder.
1907,
1908,"TURNER: Look, sir. I know this may sound ridiculous, but could those"
1909,reported sightings of UFOs have anything to do with this? 
1910,JAMIE: UFOs? What's that? 
1911,ISOBEL: Unidentified Flying Objects. Flying saucers? 
1912,TURNER: But these weren't saucers. All of the sightings were quite
1913,clear on that. 
1914,"DOCTOR: Did anyone, by any chance, photograph any of these objects? "
1915,"TURNER: Oh yes, we've got several in the files. Shall I get them? "
1916,"DOCTOR: Oh, if you would be so kind. "
1917,TURNER: Right. 
1918,DOCTOR: Unidentified Flying Objects.
1919,
1920,[Laboratory]
1921,
1922,WATKINS: What was that shooting going on? If you
1923,harmed Isobel 
1924,"VAUGHN: She's perfectly safe, Professor. "
1925,WATKINS: Why am I being taken back to London? What about my niece?
1926,What's happened to Isobel? 
1927,"VAUGHN: I tell you, she's perfectly safe. "
1928,"WATKINS: Well, I want to see her! "
1929,"VAUGHN: So you shall, when you've finished working on your machine. Do"
1930,as I ask and you shall both go free. 
1931,"WATKINS: You don't even expect me to believe you, do you? "
1932,"VAUGHN: Well, you've very little choice. Now, we're going back to"
1933,London. There you will work on your machine to my specifications. You
1934,will have twenty four hours to complete it. Only if you hasn't finished
1935,"your work by that time, would you have cause to worry about your niece."
1936,
1937,(Vaughn leaves.) 
1938,PACKER: Got everything you need? 
1939,WATKINS: Everything. 
1940,"PACKER: Come on, then. Move."
1941,
1942,[Aeroplane]
1943,
1944,(Top secret photographs are scattered over the map
1945,table.) 
1946,"BRIGADIER: Mean anything to you, Doctor? "
1947,DOCTOR: Possibly. How long ago were these objects first sighted? 
1948,BRIGADIER: Reports have been drifting in for well over a year now. We
1949,"sent up fighter planes to investigate, but nothing ever came of it. "
1950,TURNER: The odd thing about these sightings is that they usually seem
1951,to disappear somewhere over south east England. 
1952,ISOBEL: But isn't that where all those factories and laboratories of
1953,Vaughn's are? 
1954,TURNER: Exactly. That's why I brought it up. 
1955,"DOCTOR: Jamie, when you were hiding in that crate, you say something"
1956,moved? 
1957,"JAMIE: Aye, it was wrapped up in that gauze stuff. "
1958,DOCTOR: Did you recognise it at all? 
1959,JAMIE: No. 
1960,"ZOE: What do you think it was, Doctor? "
1961,DOCTOR: I don't know. We've got to find out and quickly. 
1962,ZOE: How? 
1963,"DOCTOR: Well, obviously they bring these things, whatever they are, up"
1964,from the factory in the country to the London premises. That's where
1965,we're going to find the answer. 
1966,JAMIE: You mean go back to Vaughn's place? 
1967,"BRIGADIER: I don't think that's wise, Doctor. You're been lucky so far."
1968,
1969,"JAMIE: Aye, if you think I'm going back inside there "
1970,"DOCTOR: Jamie, we have to find what is inside these crates. Brigadier,"
1971,have you got a map? Including the London premises. 
1972,"BRIGADIER: Yes, yes, I think so. Sergeant Walters! "
1973,WALTERS: Sir. 
1974,BRIGADIER: May we have map number eight please? 
1975,"WALTERS: Yes, sir. "
1976,"TURNER: I'll get it, sir. "
1977,"BRIGADIER: Thank you. Here we are. Now this, this is the whole area in"
1978,"detail. London offices, warehouse area and surrounding buildings. "
1979,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, I see. "
1980,"JAMIE: But Doctor, you can't go back the same way again. They'll be"
1981,waiting for us this time. 
1982,DOCTOR: Oh my word. How very fortunate. 
1983,BRIGADIER: Anything I can do to help? 
1984,"DOCTOR: Brigadier, you don't, by any chance, know where I can find a"
1985,canoe? 
1986,[Canal]
1987,
1988,(The Doctor and Jamie paddle a rigid canoe down the
1989,Regents canal leading under a bridge. 
1990,JAMIE: Are you sure this is how we get in? 
1991,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Now come on. "
1992,(They moor the canoe by the tow path.) 
1993,"DOCTOR: Go on, I'm holding it steady. "
1994,"(The Doctor and Jamie walk up some steps and along narrow alleys,"
1995,avoiding armed guards.

1998,
1999,(The Doctor and Jamie see two men in protective
2000,suits and a white-coated scientist with one of the crates leaning
2001,"against a wall, open.) "
2002,"DOCTOR: Jamie, I'm afraid I was right. "
2003,JAMIE: Eh? 
2004,(A whirly device is switched on. It starts throbbing. A man attaches
2005,two cables to the wrapped object and the scientist turns dials. A
2006,second sound starts up and the thing inside the fabric moves. The cloth

2014,JAMIE: Where do they come from? 
2015,"DOCTOR: I don't know, Jamie, but they're here, aren't they?! Come on,"
2016,let's go back to the canoe. 
2017,(They paddle back down the canal.)
2018,
2019,[Aeroplane]
2020,
2021,ZOE: And what do you think will happen? 
2022,"TURNER: Well, it's not really a military matter now. "
2023,ISOBEL: You'll simply hand this over to the police. 
2024,TURNER: More or less. 
2025,ISOBEL: Pity. I could have got some great pictures and made a bomb
2026,"selling them to the papers. Oh, well. "
2027,"TURNER: Look, perhaps I can compensate by buying you dinner. "
2028,ISOBEL: That would be nice. Hey are you stinking rich? 
2029,"TURNER: Not on a Captain's pay, I'm not. "
2030,"ISOBEL: It's not my day, is it? "
2031,"TURNER: Money isn't everything, you know. "
2032,(The Doctor and Jamie enter.) 
2033,"ZOE: Doctor, any luck? What did you find out? "
2034,"JAMIE: Some old friends of ours are here, Zoe. "
2035,ZOE: Who? 
2036,JAMIE: The Cybermen. 
2037,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid it's true, Zoe. "
2038,"ZOE: That's what you suspected, wasn't it? "
2039,ISOBEL: What on Earth are Cybermen? 
2040,DOCTOR: They're from another world. Inhuman killers. 
2041,"TURNER: You mean they're from space, or something. "
2042,DOCTOR + ZOE: Yes. 
2043,ZOE: And that spaceship we saw on the other side of the Moon was
2044,obviously their craft. 
2045,"ISOBEL: What are they? Little green men? Oh, you're serious? "
2046,ZOE: We've met Cybermen before and seen what they can do. 
2047,TURNER: Where exactly are they and how many? 
2048,JAMIE: At Vaughn's headquarters in London. 
2049,"DOCTOR: Oh, there's hundreds of them, possibly thousands. "
2050,ZOE: So Vaughn's helping them. 
2051,DOCTOR: That deep space radio transmitter is obviously being used by
2052,the Cybermen spaceships to home in on. 
2053,TURNER: So that's what those UFOs were. But there have been hundreds of
2054,those sightings. 
2055,"JAMIE: Aye, they must have quite an army by now. The thing is, where"
2056,are they hiding them all? 
2057,"DOCTOR: I don't know, Jamie. Captain, where's the Brigadier. "
2058,TURNER: At the Ministry of Defence. I better get on to him immediately
2059,and tell him what you've discovered. 
2060,"DOCTOR: No, no, Captain. The people who went into Vaughn's headquarters"
2061,"were different when they came out, weren't they? "
2062,TURNER: Yes. 
2063,"ZOE: Do you think they're being controlled, Doctor? "
2064,TURNER: Controlled? 
2065,"ZOE: Yes, the Cybermen have means of controlling people's minds. They"
2066,"appear to be almost normal but they're not, they're controlled. "
2067,DOCTOR: Who is the Brigadier is immediately answerable to? 
2068,TURNER: Major-General Rutlidge.
2069,
2070,[Rutlidge's office]
2071,
2072,"BRIGADIER: No cause for alarm? Billy, do you"
2073,realise what's happened? They tried to shoot down one of my
2074,helicopters. 
2075,RUTLIDGE: You were trespassing over their top security area. 
2076,"BRIGADIER: Oh, for heaven sake. If you can't trust a UNIT force, who"
2077,can you trust? 
2078,RUTLIDGE: There's nothing we 
2079,BRIGADIER: What's the matter? 
2080,"RUTLIDGE: Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. "
2081,"BRIGADIER: Look, Billy, Vaughn's a powerful chap, I know that. But"
2082,surely we can at least request a thorough investigation. 
2083,RUTLIDGE: This isn't our province. 
2084,"BRIGADIER: Well then, who's province is it? "
2085,RUTLIDGE: It's no good in getting angry about this. You must see this
2086,"from my point of view. All you've given me is vague reports, nothing"
2087,"conclusive, no proof. "
2088,BRIGADIER: No proof! 
2089,RUTLIDGE: I'm sure this is a misunderstanding. I talk to the C in C of
2090,internal security myself. 
2091,"BRIGADIER: But Billy, talk isn't going to help. I want some sort of"
2092,"action, and I want it now. At least get the civil authorities to"
2093,investigate. 
2094,RUTLIDGE: You have to leave this matter with me. 
2095,BRIGADIER: Will I? 
2096,"RUTLIDGE: If you're thinking of going to see the C in C yourself, I"
2097,shouldn't bother. You'll be wasting your time. 
2098,BRIGADIER: So you're going to do nothing? What sort of hold has Vaughn
2099,got on you? 
2100,"RUTLIDGE: Vaughn? I. Brigadier, your UNIT force will take no"
2101,precipitous action without top-priority permission. That is an order. 
2102,"BRIGADIER: I see, sir. Well, you can override my authority but not that"
2103,of UNIT Central Command. I'm sending a full report to them in Geneva. 
2104,(Lethbridge-Stewart salutes and leaves. Rutlidge activates his

2124,RUTLIDGE : I have no authority outside this country. A
2125,report is being made to UNIT Central Control. They're bound to
2126,investigate and take action.

2132,understand?

2134,VAUGHN: You will leave your office and come here to me.

2171,than that? Suppose they want to come over 
2172,"VAUGHN: Let me do the supposing, Packer. "
2173,"PACKER: Yes, Mister Vaughn. "
2174,"VAUGHN: Now, just to be on the safe side, I think we'd better conduct"
2175,an experiment. 
2176,PACKER: What do you mean? 
2177,VAUGHN: Have the Professor's machine taken down to the warehouse. Wait
2178,outside. I'll join you later.

2191,VAUGHN: You will accept what I say or our partnership is at an end. The
2192,invasion will take place at dawn tomorrow.

2220,underneath the warehouse. 
2221,"BRIGADIER: Yes, but if there's water in the sewers, wouldn't that"
2222,affect them? 
2223,"DOCTOR: Oh no, no. Besides, many of these tunnels are dry and only"
2224,flood during heavy rainfall. 
2225,"ISOBEL: What do we do, pray for a cloudburst? "
2226,"BRIGADIER: Miss Watkins, this could be very serious. "
2227,"ISOBEL: I'm sorry, but, well, it's a pretty fantastic story to swallow."
2228,
2229,"BRIGADIER: Yes, but so was the attack from the Yeti, but nevertheless"
2230,it happened. 
2231,"TURNER: With all due respect sir, she's right. No one believed in the"
2232,Yetis until they saw them. If you go to Central Command with this
2233,"story, they'll think you're mad. "
2234,"BRIGADIER: Yes. Yes, Jimmy, you're right. Of course, what we really"
2235,"need is some sort of evidence, some proof. "
2236,DOCTOR: It might be better at the moment to find out what form this
2237,attack's going to take. Jamie? 
2238,JAMIE: What? 
2239,DOCTOR: That transistor radio that Vaughn gave you. Have you still got
2240,it? 
2241,"JAMIE: Aye, here. "
2242,(Jamie hands it over and the Doctor starts to dismantle it.) 
2243,"DOCTOR: Brigadier, have you any IE equipment here? "
2244,"BRIGADIER: Er, Jimmy, have we? "
2245,"JIMMY: Yes, we have, sir. A computer and various radio and radar"
2246,components. 
2247,"DOCTOR: May I see them, please? "
2248,"BRIGADIER: Certainty. Jimmy, would you? "
2249,"TURNER: I'll show you, Doctor. This way "
2250,DOCTOR: Thank you.

2252,
2253,(Packer watches Cybermen carefully go down a
2254,"manhole in the secret room, then goes back out to the warehouse"
2255,proper.) 
2256,"VAUGHN: Ah, there you are, Packer. Everything going well? "
2257,"PACKER: Yes, Mister Vaughn. "
2258,VAUGHN: Good. Time for our little experiment. 
2259,"GREGORY: Mister Vaughn, I don't think you should "
2260,"VAUGHN: We must try the machine, Gregory. "
2261,GREGORY: But it's dangerous. 
2262,VAUGHN: It would be even more dangerous if we didn't try it. We must
2263,make sure we have an effective weapon against the Cybermen. 
2264,PACKER: You're going to try it on one of them? 
2265,VAUGHN: Why not? 
2266,(Vaughn goes up to a crate.) 
2267,VAUGHN: Revive it just enough to bring it out of its cocoon. 
2268,"TECHNICIAN: Yes, sir. "
2269,(The technicians attach the cables to the cocoon then switch on the
2270,machine. The Cyberman rips open the material.) 
2271,"VAUGHN: Hold it there. Now, Gregory, connect the Professor's machine. "
2272,(Gregory puts a box on the floor and holds a cable nervously.) 
2273,"GREGORY: Mister Vaughn, please. "
2274,VAUGHN: Connect it! 
2275,"(Gregory puts the 'stethoscope' attachment onto the Cyberman's head,"
2276,picks up his box and backs away.) 
2277,GREGORY: What emotion shall I induce? 
2278,VAUGHN: Fear. Let's see how the Cybermen will react to fear. 
2279,(Gregory switches on his box.) 
2280,Increase the power. 
2281,(The Cyberman starts to sway and make groaning electronic noises.) 
2282,VAUGHN: More power! 
2283,GREGORY: That's all there is. 
2284,"(The Cyberman rips the attachment from its head and staggers around,"
2285,flailing its arms. Guards shoot at it to no effect.) 
2286,PACKER: Quick! 
2287,The humans get out of its way as the Cyberman staggers into the secret
2288,room.) 
2289,"GREGORY: I warned you, the machine isn't ready yet. It's following the"
2290,others into the sewers. 
2291,VAUGHN: Let it go. 
2292,PACKER: It's gone mad. It could have killed us all. 
2293,"VAUGHN: Possibly, but I think we've proved that the Professor's machine"
2294,"can be effective. Get him to work on it, Gregory. I want twice as much"
2295,power and I want directional control. 
2296,"PACKER: Yeah, but what about that one? You can't let it roam down there"
2297,alone! 
2298,VAUGHN: Why not? 
2299,"PACKER: Well, it'll kill anything that gets in its way. "
2300,VAUGHN: Good. Anyone fool enough to be down in those sewers deserves to
2301,die. 
2302,[Aeroplane]
2303,
2304,ISOBEL: Now you really believe that these Cybermen
2305,things are down in the sewers. 
2306,BRIGADIER: Seems to make sense. 
2307,ISOBEL: But you can't do anything about it without proof or evidence. 
2308,BRIGADIER: Central Command would think I was mad. 
2309,"ISOBEL: Well, the answer's simple, surely. Go and get some proof. "
2310,BRIGADIER: And how do I prove that in the sewers of London there are
2311,creatures from outer space waiting to attack us. Go and get one? 
2312,"ZOE: You wouldn't stand a chance against them, Isobel. "
2313,"ISOBEL: Ah, you wouldn't have to go anywhere near them. Photograph"
2314,them. 
2315,"BRIGADIER: That's not a bad idea. Now, wait a minute, it'd be pitch"
2316,dark down in those tunnels. 
2317,"ISOBEL: You could use an infrared film, a twenty five filter on a"
2318,"thirty five mil camera with a telephoto lens, and why, you could take"
2319,frame after frame without getting anywhere near them. 
2320,BRIGADIER: Is that all gibberish or do you really know what you're
2321,talking about? 
2322,ISOBEL: Of course I know. 
2323,"BRIGADIER: If you're right, it could well be the sort of proof I need"
2324,to get some action. 
2325,"ISOBEL: Well, all I need is my cameras from the house and then I'm all"
2326,set. 
2327,"BRIGADIER: Now, wait a minute, This is hardly a job for you. "
2328,ISOBEL: Why ever not? 
2329,"BRIGADIER: Well, you're a young woman. This is a job for my men. "
2330,"ISOBEL: Well, of all the bigoted, anti-feminist, cretinous remarks "
2331,BRIGADIER: This is no job for a girl like you. Now that's final. 
2332,"ISOBEL: Oh, you, you, you man! "
2333,BRIGADIER: I'll get in touch with my photographic unit and get them
2334,onto it. 
2335,"ISOBEL: Oh, that stupid bigoted idiotic "
2336,"JAMIE: Aye, well, he's right, you know. "
2337,ZOE: Jamie McCrimmon! 
2338,"JAMIE: Well, he is. "
2339,"ZOE: Just because you're a man you think that you're superior, do you? "
2340,"JAMIE: Now, I didn't say that. Of course, it's true. "
2341,"ZOE: Is it really? Right. Coming, Isobel? "
2342,ISOBEL: What a splendid idea. 
2343,JAMIE: Where are you going? 
2344,ZOE: Do you think we should let him come with us? 
2345,"ISOBEL: Oh, I don't know. Men aren't much good in situations like this."
2346,
2347,JAMIE: Just a moment. Where are you're going? 
2348,ISOBEL: London. Coming? 
2349,JAMIE: London? Now we shouldn't do anything without the Doctor! Och. 
2350,"(Isobel and Zoe leave, followed by Jamie. In another section of the big"
2351,Hercules transport -) 
2352,DOCTOR: This is rather like looking for the proverbial needle in the
2353,proverbial. Just a minute 
2354,TURNER: Found something? 
2355,DOCTOR: I don't know. Wait a minute. 
2356,(The Doctor pulls a small computer chip from a piece of UNIT
2357,equipment.) 
2358,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I'm almost sure that this is same sort of circuit"
2359,that was in Jamie's radio. 
2360,TURNER: But what does it do? 
2361,DOCTOR: I've no idea. But it's certainly not part of that equipment.
2362,Have a look. 
2363,TURNER: But why put it a circuit if it doesn't do anything. 
2364,"DOCTOR: Oh, it does something, all right. The question is what?"
2365,
2366, [Vaughn's office]
2367,
2368,"PLANNER: One hour before invasion, the"
2369,Cyber-transmitter units will be launched into orbit around Earth. 
2370,VAUGHN: The effect will be immediate? 
2371,PLANNER: Yes. Transmissions will penetrate all areas. 
2372,VAUGHN: And if it doesn't work? 
2373,PLANNER: Humans cannot resist Cyber-control. Our forces will penetrate
2374,all areas and select suitable humans for cybernetic conversion. 
2375,VAUGHN: Conversion to Cybermen? 
2376,PLANNER: Yes. The unsuitable humans will be destroyed. 
2377,VAUGHN: No! This is not as we agreed! 
2378,PLANNER: It has been decided. 
2379,"VAUGHN: We agreed that I should remain in control of Earth. In return,"
2380,"I supply the minerals you require. You will honour that bargain,"
2381,otherwise there will be no invasion! 
2382,"PLANNER: To control, you must undergo complete conversion and become"
2383,one of us. 
2384,VAUGHN: No! My body may be cybernetic but my mind stays human. That is
2385,final! 
2386,PLANNER: It has been agreed. Discussion concluded. 
2387,(Vaughn closes the secret panel.) 
2388,PACKER: You don't trust them? 
2389,VAUGHN: Of course not. I know they'll try to take control from me when
2390,"the invasion's complete, but then, they don't know about the Cerebraton"
2391,"Machine, do they? "
2392,"PACKER: Well, I don't like it. That thing just said humans can't resist"
2393,control. How do we know these Cyber-transmissions aren't going to
2394,affect us? 
2395,VAUGHN: They won't. We shall be protected by the implanted
2396,"audio-rejection capsules. You see, Packer, I've thought all this out in"
2397,detail. Nothing has been overlooked.
2398,
2399,[Aeroplane]
2400,
2401,TURNER: Found anything? 
2402,"DOCTOR: No, I'm afraid not. What I really need is laboratory"

2404,do with the Cybermen's invasion plan. 
2405,TURNER: Perhaps we can find a lab for you to work in. 
2406,"DOCTOR: Oh, no, that's no problem, I can go up to London and use"
2407,Professor Watkins' laboratory at Travers's house. 
2408,TURNER: Right. I'll arrange transport.

2421,"WALTERS: They took a van and went back to London, sir. "

2637,(Benton pulls the pin from a grenade and drops it down the manhole.
2638,Boom!) 
2639,"WALTERS: I just don't believe it, sir. All them grenades and he still"
2640,came out of it. 
2641,"TURNER: Yes. Come on, let's get out of here. "

2644,"(In Travers' house, the Doctor is peering into a"
2645,microscope.) 
2646,BRIGADIER: Any success? 
2647,"DOCTOR: No, not yet. There's an alien logic in these circuits but I"
2648,haven't been able to work it out yet. 
2649,BRIGADIER: So we're no further ahead. 
2650,"DOCTOR: No, not yet. "
2651,BRIGADIER: Miss Watkins is developing her photographs. I'm taking a
2652,full report to Geneva and UNIT Central Command. 
2653,DOCTOR: How long will that take? 
2654,BRIGADIER: Depends. I leave in the morning. If I can get the report to
2655,the Council tomorrow we should get some action within two or three
2656,days. 
2657,DOCTOR: But that might be too late! 
2658,(Isobel enters.) 
2659,ISOBEL: Here we are. Some beauties. 
2660,(Jamie and Zoe enter. Isobel shows her prints to the Brigadier.) 
2661,BRIGADIER: Yes. 
2662,ISOBEL: What's the matter? 
2663,BRIGADIER: Nothing. They're very good. I don't want to hurt your
2664,"professional pride, Miss Watkins, but they do look a little like fakes."
2665,
2666,ISOBEL: Fakes? 
2667,(The photographs are blurred.) 
2668,"ZOE: Yes, I see what you mean. "
2669,"ISOBEL: Oh, charming, I don't know why I bothered. "
2670,(Isobel leaves.) 
2671,JAMIE: Of course they're Cybermen. Any fool can see that. 
2672,"BRIGADIER: Well, you do, McCrimmon. "
2673,JAMIE: Eh? 
2674,BRIGADIER: You know them. 
2675,JAMIE: Oh. 
2676,BRIGADIER: The people I'm trying to convince are a little more
2677,sceptical. 
2678,DOCTOR: Yes of course! 
2679,JAMIE: What? 
2680,BRIGADIER: What? 
2681,"DOCTOR: It could be, it just could be. "
2682, [Vaughn's office]
2683,
2684,PACKER: It was definitely the UNIT force. They
2685,attacked three Cybermen and destroyed two of them. 
2686,VAUGHN: How very clever of them. 
2687,PACKER: They got out alive. Now if they report on what they saw 
2688,"VAUGHN: Their reports will be meaningless, Packer. In a few hours time"
2689,the invasion will be complete. There cannot possibly be any serious
2690,opposition. 
2691,"PACKER: Well, I hope you're right. "
2692,"VAUGHN: I am, Packer, I am. Just look at it out there. Soon we shall"
2693,control all that. Has the Professor completed his work on the
2694,Cerebraton Mentor machine? 
2695,PACKER: Yes. Gregory's bringing him now. 
2696,(Door bell.) 
2697,PACKER: That'll be them. 
2698,"(Packer opens the door. Watkins is carrying the box, Gregory and a"
2699,guard right behind him.) 
2700,"VAUGHN: Ah, come in gentlemen. Well, Gregory, success? "
2701,"GREGORY: I don't know yet, sir. We've added narrow bandwidth"
2702,transducers. Should make transmission more directional. 
2703,"VAUGHN: Good, good. Show me. "
2704,WATKINS: This is madness. That machine is a deadly weapon now. 
2705,VAUGHN: Really? 
2706,WATKINS: The modifications were quite unnecessary. It worked perfectly
2707,well as it was. 
2708,"VAUGHN: For your purposes, perhaps, Professor. I have a somewhat"
2709,different use for it. 
2710,"WATKINS: All right, all right. Do with it what you will. The machine's"
2711,"yours now. Now, will you let me get out of this place? And let Isobel"
2712,go free as you promise? 
2713,"VAUGHN: But my dear fellow, she is free. "
2714,WATKINS: Free? Where? Where is she? 
2715,"VAUGHN: Probably sitting quite comfortably at home. Now then, how does"
2716,one operate this? 
2717,"GREGORY: Careful, Mister Vaughn. Don't point it at anyone. "
2718,"VAUGHN: No? Dangerous is it? Fear, Watkins. Do you know what fear is? "
2719,"WATKINS: No, don't! Don't do that! Don't! "
2720,"(Vaughn switches the machine on with its trumpet pointing at Watkins,"
2721,who tenses up in pain and fear.) 
2722,"GREGORY: Mister Vaughn, you'll kill him! Stop! "
2723,"VAUGHN: Perhaps we should try the effects of the machine on you,"
2724,Gregory! At full power! 
2725,"GREGORY: No, no, Mister Vaughn. I was only afraid that if we still"
2726,needed the Professor 
2727,VAUGHN: I'm aware of that. Unfortunately I suppose that I still need
2728,"you, otherwise I. (to guard) Pick him up. "
2729,(Gregory and the guard hold Watkins up.) 
2730,"VAUGHN: Professor, you'll be taken back to the factory compound. I want"
2731,these machines on the production lines immediately. Do you understand? 
2732,"WATKINS: Vaughn, obviously I can't choose but to work for you. If I"
2733,"refuse, you'll torture me or kill me. I know I can't stand up to"
2734,"torture, and I don't want to die. You're an evil man, Vaughn. You're"
2735,"sadistic. You're a megalomaniac. You're insane. I pity you, but if I"
2736,"get half a chance, I'll kill you. "
2737,"VAUGHN: Kill me? Would you? Give me your gun, Packer. "
2738,(Shades of Richard III by Shakespeare. Packer gives Vaughn his pistol.
2739,Vaughn points it at Watkin's head then turns it round and offers it to
2740,the little man.) 
2741,VAUGHN: Take it. There you are. Take it. 
2742,(Vaughn puts the gun in Watkins' hand. Gregory and Packer and the guard
2743,back away.) 
2744,"VAUGHN: Now you're free to shoot me, Professor. Shoot. Shoot! "
2745,(Vaughn knocks Watkins down.) 
2746,"VAUGHN: Come on, the gun's loaded, or haven't you got the courage to"
2747,pull the trigger? 
2748,"(Watkins gets up and fires three times, point blank, then faints."
2749,"Vaughn has three smoking holes in his shirt, but is standing there"
2750,laughing.) 
2751,VAUGHN: Take him away. Get work started on the machine immediately.

2768,TURNER: Good. Over and out. Thanks. 
2769,ISOBEL: I'm forgiven then? 
2770,TURNER: What? 
2771,ISOBEL: For being such a twit and going down those sewers. I'm sorry
2772,about the soldier. 
2773,"TURNER: Yes, well, it's all right. You weren't to know what you were"
2774,really letting
2775,yourself in for. 
2776,"ISOBEL: Why, I would have got us all killed. I just didn't realise. I"
2777,"mean, those Cybermen things. I've just been listening to Zoe telling"
2778,"the Brigadier all about them for his report, and they really do sound"
2779,as murderous as they look. 
2780,"TURNER: You know, we dropped five grenades right on top of them and one"
2781,of them still came out of it. I'd hate to have to fight a whole army of
2782,them. 
2783,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no! "
2784,"JAMIE: What's the matter, Doctor? Would someone mind telling me what's"
2785,going on? 
2786,"TURNER: Don't worry, Jamie. Finish your tea and go back to sleep. "

2789,the Brigadier for me? 
2790,"ISOBEL: Oh, sure. "

2793,"WALTERS : Report from Red sector one, sir, at twenty thirty hours "

2801,the Professor. 
2802,"BRIGADIER: Well, officially we "
2803,"ISOBEL: Oh do. Please, do. "
2804,"DOCTOR: Brigadier, if you could rescue him, he might be able to help us"
2805,with our problem. 
2806,BRIGADIER: All right. Your shindig Jimmy. 
2807,"TURNER: Sergeant, tell Benton to stay with them. I'm on my way now."
2808,I'll contact him on route. Over. 
2809,WALTERS : Wilco. Over. 
2810,"BRIGADIER: Jimmy, don't take any chances. Vaughn's lot know we mean"
2811,business so they won't be playing games. 
2812,"TURNER: No, sir, neither will I. I'll take the full assault platoon"
2813,with me. 
2814,BRIGADIER: Right. 
2815,"TURNER: Sergeant, alert the full assault platoon. I'll relay"
2816,"instructions on route. Have you got that, over? "
2817,"WALTERS : Yes, sir. Over. "

2828,"GREGORY: There were at least thirty of them, all"

2832,GREGORY: What could we do? There were at least 
2833,"VAUGHN: Thirty of them, you say? "
2834,"GREGORY: It was hopeless. They shot the two guards, and they'd have"
2835,shot me if 
2836,VAUGHN: If you hadn't run away. 
2837,"GREGORY: Well, yes. "
2838,VAUGHN: You realise of course that without the Professor's assistance
2839,it will not be possible to get the Cerebraton Machine on the production

2854,WATKINS: No. 
2855,"DOCTOR: Oh, my word. "
2856,WATKINS: I couldn't understand why Vaughn wanted the modifications to
2857,the machine. 
2858,DOCTOR: You say he's going to mass produce these machines? 
2859,WATKINS: Yes. 
2860,BRIGADIER: Why should he want a weapon like that if he's got the
2861,Cybermen to fight for him? 
2862,DOCTOR: I've no idea. Unless. Professor! You say that you developed
2863,this machine to produce excessively powerful emotional pulses. 
2864,"WATKINS: Yes, that's true. "
2865,"DOCTOR: Well, that's it! Vaughn going to use it as a weapon against the"
2866,Cybermen once he has no further use for them. 
2867,"BRIGADIER: What, the Professor's machine? "
2868,DOCTOR: Yes. Emotion is alien to the Cybermen's nervous system. It'll
2869,destroy it. The micro-monolithic circuits. They're emotional circuits!
2870,No wonder they weren't logical. Now why didn't I think of this before.
2871,"Now, let's see. "
2872,(The Doctor goes to the microscope.) 
2873,JAMIE: Now what's he up to? 
2874,ZOE: I've no idea. 
2875,WATKINS: Doctor. Doctor. 
2876,"BRIGADIER: Yes, well, look, Jimmy, I'd better get back to Control. I"
2877,"leave for Geneva at dawn. If the Doctor should come up with anything,"
2878,let me know. 
2879,"TURNER: Right, sir. "
2880,"JAMIE: Oh. Oh well, if anything exciting happens, wake me up, will you?"
2881,I was in the middle of a lovely dream. 
2882,"ZOE: Honestly, Jamie. Cybermen underneath London and all you can think"
2883,about is your sleep.

2885,are carrying ray guns. Later - ) 
2886,"ZOE: Jamie. Jamie, wake up. "
2887,"JAMIE: Och, there's no peace. What is it? "
2888,ZOE: The Doctor discovered something important. Come on! 
2889,"DOCTOR: Let's hope it isn't. Oh, how do you do, Jamie? Now then, here"
2890,is the Earth. And here is the Moon. 
2891,(The Doctor points to a rough drawing he has made on a piece of board.)
2892,
2893,DOCTOR: And these are the communication satellites circling the Earth.
2894,"And here is the Cybermen's spaceship, the invasion spaceship, the one"
2895,"that we saw. Right, now if I'm right, I think that this will come to"
2896,this side of the Moon and boost signals to the Earth. 
2897,WATKINS: The signals will activate these circuits. 
2898,DOCTOR: Precisely. 
2899,ZOE: But you still haven't told us what that will do. 
2900,DOCTOR: The micro-monolithic circuits are artificial nervous systems.
2901,Once activated they will produce the Cyber-hypnotic force that controls
2902,human beings. 
2903,"TURNER: But there are hundreds, thousands of these circuits in IE"
2904,equipment all over the world. 
2905,WATKINS: Exactly. 
2906,ISOBEL: So everybody will come under their control. 
2907,"ZOE: Yes, the Cybermen will take over everybody. "
2908,"TURNER: Well, isn't there anything we can do? "
2909,"DOCTOR: Yes, there is a way to block the signals, isn't there, Zoe. "
2910,"ZOE: The depolariser. Worn at the back of the neck, it will jam the"
2911,Cyber-control waves. 
2912,"DOCTOR: Yes. Have you any neuristors here, Professor? "
2913,"WATKINS: Well, a few, I think. "

2934,BRIGADIER : Will do. Out. 
2935,"DOCTOR: Now then, now many have you made, Zoe? "
2936,"ZOE: Only three, I'm afraid. We couldn't find any more neuristors. "

3061,stop you.

3066,"Walters grabs a rifle, runs up to the front door and rings the bell."
3067,"Turner lets him in, pistol ready.) "
3068,"WALTERS: Oh, thanks, sir. "
3069,TURNER: Thank goodness you made it. Any trouble? 
3070,"WALTERS: Hundreds of Cybermen about, sir. "
3071,"TURNER: Well, the sooner we get out of here, the better. Everybody"
3072,ready? 
3073,ALL  Yes! 
3074,"ISOBEL : Ready, we're coming. "
3075,WALTERS: Listen! 
3076,(Turner looks outside as an IE jeep screeches to a halt across the
3077,road.) 
3078,"TURNER: We've had the jeep. We'd better get out of here, out of the"
3079,back way as quickly as possible. 
3080,WALTERS: Right! 
3081,"TURNER: Come on, move, everybody. Quickly! Out of the back door. Hurry"
3082,"it up. Come on Jamie. Professor, all right? Good. "
3083,(Watkins is carrying the R/T. A rifle barrel smashes the glass in the
3084,front door and he is shot.) 
3085,WATKINS: My leg! 
3086,(Turner fires two shots then his pistol jams.) 
3087,"TURNER: Come on, Jamie. Get the radio out of here. "
3088,JAMIE: Right. 
3089,TURNER: Leave the Professor to me. 
3090,JAMIE: Okay. Have you got him? 
3091,"TURNER: Yes. Right, I've got him. "
3092,JAMIE: Right. 
3093,TURNER: Come on. 
3094,(Three more shots come through the front door and Jamie is hit but
3095,manages to stagger to the back of the house.)

3098,
3099,"BRIGADIER: Yes, Jimmy, where are you? "
3100,"TURNER : In bother, sir. We need help. Can you give us a chopper. "
3101,BRIGADIER: Yes. Can you make sector five? 
3102,"TURNER : We can try, sir. "
3103,"BRIGADIER: Right, I'll get the chopper there. Out. UNIT Control calling"
3104,sector five chopper. Over. 
3105,PILOT : Receiving you. Over. 
3106,BRIGADIER: This is the Brigadier. Are you airborne? 
3107,"PILOT : Yes, sir. "
3108,BRIGADIER: Right. Proceed to sector five and pick up Captain Turner and
3109,"party, and bring them here. "
3110,PILOT : Wilco. Out.

3113,
3114,VAUGHN: How could they escape the Cyber-control? 
3115,"PACKER: It's that Doctor, something to do with him. You should have got"
3116,rid of him when you had the chance. 
3117,"VAUGHN: Shut up, Packer! I must go on with the invasion. "
3118,"PACKER: But what about the Professor? Without him, we can't make any"
3119,more machines. Without machines we can't control the Cybermen. 
3120,"VAUGHN: Let me worry about that. For the moment, I have the Cybermen"
3121,exactly where I want them. 
3122,"PACKER: Yeah, but for how long? Now, can you honestly say that"
3123,"everything's going according to plan, that nothing's been overlooked?"
3124,"Well, can you? "
3125,"VAUGHN: Just obey my orders! Now, get in touch with the compound and"
3126,have the radio beam projected. The invasion fleet must be brought in.
3127,
3128,[Aeroplane]
3129,
3130,(In flight.) 
3131,"WALTERS: New York's off the air, sir. Moscow's dead and Peking. In"
3132,"fact, nothing. No radio communication at all. "
3133,"BRIGADIER: Right, Sergeant. Keep trying all frequencies. "
3134,"WALTERS: Yes, sir. "
3135,BRIGADIER: It seems to be a total blanket all over the world. 
3136,"TURNER: Look, couldn't we make hundreds of these neuristor things, sir,"
3137,and distribute them. 
3138,"BRIGADIER: I doubt there's time for that Jimmy. What do you think,"
3139,Doctor? 
3140,DOCTOR: I agree. The Cybermen will attack in force now. There must be
3141,thousands of them in outer space. 
3142,BRIGADIER: Is there nothing we can do? 
3143,DOCTOR: Not unless we can stop the Cyber-control signals. 
3144,"BRIGADIER: Yes, but if your theory's right, they'll be coming from"
3145,somewhere near the moon. That means we're going to need a missile of
3146,some sort. 
3147,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid it does. "
3148,TURNER: That would need an orbital launch vehicle. We simply haven't
3149,got anything of that size. 
3150,"BRIGADIER: No, only the Americans and the Russians have. Wait a minute."
3151,
3152,(Lethbridge-Stewart gets thick lever binder from a safe.) 
3153,"BRIGADIER: I seem to remember reading. Ah, yes, yes, here we are. The"
3154,Russians were planning a countdown at the time we were attacked. 
3155,"TURNER: For the moon, sir? "
3156,"BRIGADIER: Yes, a manned orbital survey. That means they'll have a"
3157,launching vehicle almost ready to go. 
3158,"TURNER: You mean we could put a warhead on it, in place of the"
3159,astronaut capsule? 
3160,BRIGADIER: It's a possibility. 
3161,DOCTOR: How long would all this take? 
3162,"BRIGADIER: Well, we could get a small party there in about two hours."
3163,"Of course, we'll have to revive the rocket personnel from"
3164,"Cyber-control. After that, well, that'd be up to the Russians. "
3165,TURNER: It means it's all a question of time. How long do you think we
3166,"have, Doctor? "
3167,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm surprised they're not here already. "
3168,"BRIGADIER: Jimmy, here's the gen on the Russian rocket base. You deal"
3169,with that. 
3170,"TURNER: All right, sir. "
3171,BRIGADIER: And get your skates on. 
3172,"TURNER: Yes, sir. "
3173,"BRIGADIER: Now, Doctor, we must deal with this invasion you say is"
3174,coming. 
3175,"DOCTOR: Yes, at least we know where they'll land. They'll home in on"
3176,Vaughn's radio signal. 
3177,BRIGADIER: Would we be able to pick them off with anti-missile
3178,missiles? 
3179,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's a good idea. We might have a try. "
3180,BRIGADIER: Right. There's a base near Henlow Downs. Just a minute.
3181,Sergeant Walters? 
3182,(Zoe enters.) 
3183,"DOCTOR: Oh, Zoe, sit down. It's a big bumpy. Now, how's Jamie's leg? "
3184,"ZOE: Oh, it's just a slight flesh wound. But he's furious because the"
3185,Army doctor won't let him walk on it. 
3186,"DOCTOR: Well, he would be, wouldn't he. How's the Professor? "
3187,"ZOE: Oh, he'll be all right, Isobel's with him. Anything I can do,"
3188,Doctor? 
3189,DOCTOR: Well I suggest that you go with the Brigadier. Much as I detest
3190,"computers, I think that remarkable brain of yours will come in very"
3191,handy. 
3192,ZOE: Right. What are you going to do? 
3193,DOCTOR: I think it's about time I had a serious talk with our Mister
3194,Vaughn. 
3195,"ZOE: What, go back? But he'd kill you as soon as look at you. "
3196,"DOCTOR: No, we need time if we're going to stop this attack, and I"
3197,think I can get us that time. 
3198,"BRIGADIER: No, this is madness, I can't afford to let you take that"
3199,risk. 
3200,"DOCTOR: You can't afford not to, Brigadier. If you're going to attack"
3201,"the Cybermen with missiles, they're going to retaliate, and we want to"
3202,know how and with what. 
3203,ZOE: But how can you find that out? 
3204,"DOCTOR: I'll leave my radio on, and then you'll hear every word that"
3205,passes between me and Vaughn. 
3206,BRIGADIER: But you'll never get near the place. The whole area will be
3207,crawling with Cybermen. 
3208,"DOCTOR: Oh, there's one particular place where there'll be no Cybermen."
3209,
3210,BRIGADIER: Where's that? 
3211,DOCTOR: In the sewers. 
3212,"WALTERS: We're coming in to land, sir."

3214,[Airfield]
3215,
3216,(The Brigadier and Zoe watch as the Doctor drives a
3217,Land Rover out of the Hercules.) 
3218,DOCTOR: Bye bye. 
3219,(He drives away. Captain Turner comes down with another one.) 
3220,"BRIGADIER: All set, Jimmy? "
3221,"TURNER: Yes, sir. I've got a hypersonic jet laid on. We'll be in Russia"
3222,in no time. 
3223,BRIGADIER: Splendid. 
3224,ZOE: Good luck. 
3225,TURNER: Thank you.
3226,

3228,
3229,WALTERS: All sections prepare for take-off. Secure
3230,loading bay and stand by in flight positions. All UNIT ground section
3231,leaders stand by on full alert readiness. 
3232,"BRIGADIER: Sergeant Walters, ask Wing Commander Robbins to bring us"
3233,down at the nearest airstrip to Henlow Downs Defence base. 
3234,"WALTERS: Yes, sir. "
3235,"BRIGADIER: Oh, and Sergeant, make sure that a chopper stays in Red"
3236,sector one area. The Doctor might need it in a hurry.
3237,
3238,[Sewers]
3239,
3240,DOCTOR: (sotto) UNIT control. This is the Doctor.
3241,"Is the Brigadier there, please? "
3242,"WALTERS : Hold on a moment, sir. I'll get him. "
3243,"BRIGADIER : Yes, Doctor, go ahead. "
3244,"DOCTOR: Brigadier, I've just entered the sewers. I'm going to make my"
3245,way to Vaughn's headquarters. I'll give you a call when I get there. 
3246,BRIGADIER : Right. We'll have a chopper in the area in case you get
3247,in trouble. 
3248,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
3249,(The Doctor puts the radio in his inside pocket then tosses a coin to
3250,decide which way he should go.)
3251,
3252,[Aeroplane]
3253,
3254,ZOE: But your helicopter isn't going to be much use
3255,to the Doctor if he does meet any Cybermen down in those sewers. 
3256,"BRIGADIER: If you've got any better suggestions, I'll be pleased to"
3257,hear them. 
3258,"WALTERS: Excuse me, sir. "
3259,BRIGADIER: Yes. 
3260,WALTERS: Captain Turner's airborne. ETA over Russia two hours seven
3261,minutes from takeoff. 
3262,BRIGADIER: Good. Keep the Doctor's channel open and let me know the
3263,moment he contacts you. 
3264,"WALTERS: Yes, sir. "
3265,"BRIGADIER: Well, don't look so worried. Fancy a cup of tea?"
3266,
3267, [Vaughn's office]
3268,
3269,PACKER: With particularly heavy concentrations
3270,"here, here, here, and here. "
3271,VAUGHN: And all the main communication centres are now manned by our
3272,forces? 
3273,"PACKER: Yes, but, er "
3274,"VAUGHN: What? But what, Packer? "
3275,"PACKER: Well, we can't make a complete takeover without the full"
3276,invasion force. 
3277,"VAUGHN: They'll arrive, Packer, they'll arrive. And when they do, there"
3278,won't be one city in the entire world that we don't control. Think of
3279,"it, Packer, the entire world! "
3280,(An alarm sounds.) 
3281,PACKER: It's the security alarm. The UNIT forces must have 
3282,VAUGHN: Packer! 
3283,(Vaughn goes through the security camera views until - .) 
3284,"DOCTOR : Oh, there you are. Can you hear me, Mister Vaughn?"
3285,
3286,VAUGHN: Yes? 
3287,"DOCTOR : I hope I haven't called at an inconvenient moment,"
3288,but I would rather like a word with you. 
3289,VAUGHN: Clever of you to avoid our Cyber-control beam. 
3290,"DOCTOR : Oh, it was nothing. I'll come up. I know the way. "
3291,(Transmission ends.) 
3292,PACKER: He must be out of his mind. 
3293,"VAUGHN: Far from it, Packer. Have the guards search the building, just"
3294,in case he's brought any friends with him. 
3295,PACKER: Why not just kill him? He's caused enough trouble already. 
3296,"VAUGHN: You forget, Packer. He's our insurance."

3303,BRIGADIER: Fine. Tell the raiding party to stand by. 
3304,"WALTERS: Yes, sir. "
3305,DOCTOR : Brigadier. Brigadier. 
3306,"BRIGADIER: Yes, Doctor, go ahead. "
3307,DOCTOR : Ah. I'm just about to enter the lion's den. I will leave
3308,the radio on as from now. 
3309,BRIGADIER: Right. Good luck. 
3310,DOCTOR : Thank you. 
3311,BRIGADIER: Keep that channel open and get the whole thing on tape. 
3312,"WALTERS: Yes, sir. "
3313,"BRIGADIER: If he yells for help while I'm away, send in everything"
3314,we've got to get him out. 
3315,WALTERS: Right. 
3316,"VAUGHN : Ah Doctor, what an unexpected pleasure. Do come in."
3317,
3318, [Vaughn's office]
3319,
3320,DOCTOR: And you trust them? 
3321,"VAUGHN: Doctor, I've worked with the Cybermen for five years preparing"
3322,"this invasion. I know them, the way they think, the single-mindedness"
3323,of their purpose. 
3324,DOCTOR: Then you must know what ruthless and inhuman killers they are. 
3325,"VAUGHN: Of course. But then, they are my allies, not my enemies. "
3326,DOCTOR: Do you really think they'll honour any bargain that you make
3327,with them? 
3328,"VAUGHN: Oh, I've planned this whole operation in great detail, allowing"
3329,"for every possible factor. It was I who contacted them in deep space,"
3330,"provided the means by which they travelled to Earth, and masterminded"
3331,the whole operation from A to Z. They have merely provided their
3332,"advanced scientific skills, their might and strength. "
3333,DOCTOR: What do they get out of all this? 
3334,"VAUGHN: What they want, and what they're going to get, are two entirely"
3335,different things. 
3336,"DOCTOR: Oh, you're a fool, Vaughn. When they get here, they'll take"
3337,over. 
3338,VAUGHN: All Cybermen here are conditioned to obey my orders. They are
3339,directly under my command. 
3340,"DOCTOR: Oh, possibly. But what about the others, out there in space?"
3341,Are they conditioned to obey your commands? 
3342,"VAUGHN: If they're not, I'll destroy them. "
3343,DOCTOR: With the Professor's machine? 
3344,VAUGHN: Yes. 
3345,DOCTOR: With one machine? 
3346,VAUGHN: I'll have more made. 
3347,"DOCTOR: But you'll have to have the Professor's help to do that, won't"
3348,you? We've got the Professor. 
3349,"VAUGHN: They'll be under my command, exactly like the others. "
3350,"DOCTOR: But you can't be sure of that, can you?"
3351,
3352,[Henlow Downs]
3353,
3354,"(Everyone here is out cold when Lethbridge-Stewart,"
3355,Zoe and two soldiers enter.) 
3356,"BRIGADIER: Get all these men fitted with neuristors, and put the radio"
3357,over there. 
3358,(Zoe starts on the nearest man). 
3359,"BRIGADIER: UNIT Control, UNIT Control, how do you read me? Over. "
3360,"WALTERS : Loud and clear, sir. Over. "
3361,BRIGADIER: Any trouble? 
3362,"WALTERS : No, sir. Captain Turner reports they're over the Russian"
3363,"border now, sir. Over. "
3364,ZOE: How about the Doctor? 
3365,"BRIGADIER: Sergeant, how about the Doctor? "
3366,"WALTERS : So far, so good, sir. Over. "
3367,BRIGADIER: Right. Out. 
3368,(The men with new neuristers start to wake.). 
3369,"BRIGADIER: Take it easy, Major. "
3370,"BRANWELL: What happened? Were we, were we attacked? "
3371,BRIGADIER: Now just try and clear your head. There's a great deal to be
3372,done.
3373,
3374, [Vaughn's office]
3375,
3376,DOCTOR: But you daren't take the risk! Once the
3377,"Cybermen take over, they'll destroy the Earth as we know it! "
3378,"VAUGHN: You're just playing for time, aren't you? "
3379,DOCTOR: I'm trying to stop you from destroying the human race! 
3380,VAUGHN: Your UNIT friends. You presumably managed to protect them from
3381,the Cyber-control as well? What are they planning? 
3382,DOCTOR: I don't know what you're talking about. 
3383,VAUGHN: Packer? 
3384,"PACKER : Yes, sir. "
3385,VAUGHN: Is the radio beam in the compound aligned yet? 
3386,"PACKER : Yes, sir. It's all ready. "
3387,VAUGHN: Good. Then link the beam to the invasion fleet. 
3388,"PACKER : Right, Mister Vaughn. "
3389,"VAUGHN: Whatever it is your UNIT friends are trying to do, it's too"
3390,late.
3391,
3392,[Henlow Downs]
3393,
3394,BRANWELL: But this is fantastic. Unbelievable. 
3395,BRIGADIER: Nevertheless true. We believe they'll be sending their full
3396,"invasion fleet at any time. If they get here, we've had it. "
3397,"BRANWELL: I see, sir. Sergeant Peters? "
3398,PETERS: Sir. 
3399,BRANWELL: Anything on the scope? 
3400,"PETERS: Not a glimmer, sir. "
3401,"BRANWELL: Well, sir? "
3402,BRIGADIER: I suppose we could be too late. 
3403,ZOE: What's the maximum range of your radar? 
3404,"PETERS: Accurate up to fifty thousand miles, miss. Dodgy after that. "
3405,"ZOE: Well, that means we're not likely to pick them up until they're"
3406,almost on top of us. 
3407,"BRANWELL: Yes, that's true. Well, let's be prepared in case they do"
3408,"appear on the screens. Sergeant Peters, prepare all launch pads. Begin"
3409,fuel priming and start preliminary countdown. 
3410,PETERS: Sir. 
3411,"(Pads 1-8 go to stand by, with their triple missile complements"
3412,swinging up and round ready to launch.)

3416,PLANNER: The transporters will be launched. 
3417,VAUGHN: It's all arranged. 
3418,PLANNER: The invasion fleet will arrive in two parts. 
3419,DOCTOR: You must stop them! This is madness! You can't trust them! 
3420,VAUGHN: Don't you understand yet? I have no alternative. (sotto) I
3421,"can't see all these years of work destroyed. I must go on, I must!"
3422,
3423,[Henlow Downs]
3424,
3425,"WALTERS : That's what we hear, sir. The rest of"
3426,them are on their way. Over. 
3427,"BRANWELL: Something coming in now, sir. "
3428,BRIGADIER: Anything from Captain Turner? Have they landed in Russia
3429,yet? 
3430,"WALTERS : They've landed, sir, but we've heard nothing more. Over. "
3431,BRIGADIER: I see. Out. 
3432,"PETERS: Sir, it's just on range limits now, sir. Faint yet, but moving"
3433,in fast. 
3434,BRIGADIER: Is this it? 
3435,"BRANWELL: It looks like it, sir. "
3436,"PETERS: More now, sir, look. They're on a ballistic trajectory. "
3437,(A V formation of dots heads towards the middle of the radar screen.) 
3438,ZOE: How long before they'll be within range of your missiles? 
3439,"PETERS: At this rate, a couple of minutes at the moment, miss. "
3440,BRANWELL: Sergeant Peters? 
3441,PETERS: Sir! 
3442,BRANWELL: Where are we on countdown? 
3443,PETERS: T minus forty five seconds sir. 
3444,BRANWELL: Hold. 
3445,(Branwell uses the base intercom. The status board has moved from Stand
3446,By to Phasing and Readiness.)

3448,Prepare fuse locks. 
3449,WOMAN : Fuse locks in preparation. Arming code running. 
3450,BRANWELL: Run co-ordinates programme A theta. 
3451,PETERS: Sir! 
3452,ZOE: There are more of them! 
3453,PETERS: Sir. 
3454,"BRANWELL: Sky range probes active. Yes, what is it. "
3455,"PETERS: More of them, sir! "
3456,WOMAN : Arming code run. All warheads ready for lift off

3459,Lift off the activation check. 
3460,PETERS: Coordinate programme running sir. 
3461,BRANWELL: Link programme to telemeter guidance. 
3462,PETERS: Roger. 
3463,"ZOE: Major, I think we stand a good chance of getting at least ninety"
3464,percent of them. 
3465,BRANWELL: How? We haven't got enough missiles. 
3466,"ZOE: Oh please, Major. Just knocking out half a dozen of them would do"
3467,very little good at all. Let's try for them all. 
3468,"BRANWELL: Look, Miss, I know my business and I'm telling you we haven't"
3469,got enough missiles. 
3470,"ZOE: Yes, you have. These things are coming in in a formation pattern."
3471,Now if you set your missiles carefully you can set up a chain reaction
3472,of explosions. 
3473,BRANWELL: No. There isn't time to compute all the relevant information.
3474,They'd be on top of us by then. 
3475,ZOE: Give me thirty seconds. 
3476,"BRIGADIER: Give her what she asks, Major. Thirty seconds. "
3477,"BRANWELL: But sir, this is ridiculous! "
3478,BRIGADIER: Just thirty seconds.

3480,"PETERS: Sir, that doesn't give us much time. "

3482,five seconds. 
3483,"(Zoe grabs a clipboard, takes data from the control panels along the"
3484,wall and does some sums.) 
3485,ZOE: Here. Feed this into your computer. 
3486,"BRANWELL: Do as she says, now. I'll take over here. "
3487,PETERS: Sir. 
3488,BRANWELL: You'd better be right. 
3489,ZOE: I am. 
3490,BRANWELL: T minus forty five seconds from now. 
3491,"PETERS: Information computed, sir. Thank you, miss. "
3492,(Zoe lets Peters sit down again.) 
3493,BRANWELL: Align to telemeter guidance. 
3494,PETERS: Sir. T minus thirty two seconds. 
3495,"WOMAN : Launch crew clear, sir. "

3505,"into the air, shedding their booster rockets. Once in space, they"
3506,strike the Cyber-fleet. KaBOOMs all round.)

3508, [Vaughn's office]
3509,
3510,PLANNER: The first transporter fleet is being
3511,attacked and destroyed. You have betrayed us. 
3512,VAUGHN: No! 
3513,PLANNER: The failure of this mission is due to you. We will now take
3514,over the invasion. 
3515,VAUGHN: No! Wait! Give me time! I can stop this opposition! 
3516,PLANNER: There is no more time. 
3517,VAUGHN: I won't allow this invasion to 
3518,(Vaughn steps into the Planner's alcove but is stopped and forced back
3519,by an energy wall.) 
3520,PLANNER: We no longer need you. A Cyber-megatron bomb will be
3521,delivered. We must destroy life on Earth completely. Every living
3522,being. 
3523,DOCTOR: Is this what you wanted? To be the ruler of a dead world? 
3524, Episode Eight
3525,
3526,[Aeroplane]
3527,
3528,VAUGHN : You can't do that. You can't destroy
3529,the world. What about me? 
3530,PLANNER : You are of no further use to us. The Cyber-invasion must
3531,succeed. The bomb will be delivered. 
3532,"ISOBEL: Hey, you'd better call "
3533,BENTON: UNIT Control calling the Brigadier. UNIT Control calling the
3534,Brigadier. Over.
3535,
3536,[Henlow Downs]
3537,
3538,"BRANWELL: Every single one of them, knocked right"
3539,out of the sky. 
3540,"BRIGADIER: Exactly as you predicted, a chain reaction of explosions. "
3541,BRANWELL: It's fantastic. How do you do it? 
3542,"ZOE: Well, it's all quite logical really. Hardly any calculation needed"
3543,"at all. Except for simple stuff like speed, angle of descent and"
3544,relative positions of the spaceships. 
3545,"PETERS: Can't we keep her on, sir? She's much prettier than a computer."
3546,
3547,BENTON : Calling the Brigadier. 
3548,"BRIGADIER: Quiet, everyone! "
3549,BENTON : UNIT control calling the Brigadier. Over. 
3550,"BRIGADIER: Yes, Sergeant, what's the flap? "
3551,"BENTON : Corporal Benton here, sir. "
3552,"BRIGADIER: Benton? Well, what's happened to Sergeant Walters? "
3553,"BENTON : He's taken over the Geneva link, sir. "
3554,"BRIGADIER: Oh, I see. Well, what's the flap? "
3555,"BENTON : It's news from the Doctor, sir, just come through on his"
3556,open channel. They're going to drop some sort of bomb. 
3557,BRIGADIER: Bomb? You mean the Cyberman are? 
3558,"BENTON : Yes, sir. Something called a Cyber-megatron bomb. They're"
3559,"going to wipe us all out, sir. "
3560,"BRIGADIER: Right, Benton, stand by. We're on our way back. Out. We're"
3561,"moving out. Keep in touch, Major. We'll keep all radio communication on"
3562,open network so that you'll know what's going on. 
3563,BRANWELL: Right sir. 
3564,BRIGADIER: And keep your eyes skinned in case they start sending any
3565,more stuff in. And try and get a fix on that bomb. 
3566,"BRANWELL: If we do, sir, we'll try to touch it off on its approach"
3567,orbit. 
3568,BRIGADIER: Right. Let's go! 
3569, [Vaughn's office]
3570,
3571,"VAUGHN: But if you do, you'll destroy everything"
3572,here. Even your own Cybermen! 
3573,PLANNER: The sacrifice will be small. 
3574,VAUGHN: You can't do this! I won't let you! 
3575,PLANNER: You cannot stop us. No one can. 
3576,"DOCTOR: Now you're beginning to understand the Cybermen, Vaughn, you"
3577,can't make bargains with them! 
3578,VAUGHN: I won't let them take over. I won't! You think you're
3579,"indestructible? Well, I can destroy all of you! "
3580,(Vaughn aims Walter's device at the Planner and turns it on.) 
3581,PLANNER: Opposition is useless. The Cybermen will 
3582,"DOCTOR: Vaughn! Switch it off, you'll blow us all sky high! "
3583,VAUGHN: I'll destroy them all! All! 
3584,(The Cyber-Planner goes boom!) 
3585,VAUGHN: It's dead. I killed it. I destroyed it. 
3586,DOCTOR: That won't stop them. They're still out there in space
3587,preparing to destroy the world. 
3588,"VAUGHN: Five years, and in less than five seconds! "
3589,"DOCTOR: Vaughn, listen to me. The Cybermen will deliver their bomb on"
3590,the same radio beam they used for their invasion. You've got to turn it
3591,"off, man. You've got to turn it off! "
3592,VAUGHN: What? 
3593,"DOCTOR: We're both on the same side now, both fighting for our lives."
3594,You've got to turn the radio beam off! 
3595,VAUGHN: The radio? 
3596,DOCTOR: Yes! That's how they'll deliver their bomb! 
3597,"VAUGHN: The radio beam! Yes, yes, Packer must. Packer! Packer! Where"
3598,are you? 
3599,(A Cyberman appears on the monitor. Packer enters.) 
3600,"PACKER: Vaughn! They've taken over! The Cybermen, they won't obey!"
3601,"They've killed the. They're coming after us. Vaughn, what have you done"
3602,to us? What have you done? 
3603,(A Cyberman enters. Packer tries shooting it but is killed by the beam
3604,from its chest unit. The Doctor pops up from behind Vaughn's desk and
3605,turns Walter's device on it. The Cyberman collapses in smoke.) 
3606,"DOCTOR: Vaughn, where is the transmitter for the radio beam? "
3607,VAUGHN: We can't fight them. They're too powerful. Too many of them. 
3608,"DOCTOR: Oh, don't be a fool, man. Where do we turn it off? "
3609,"VAUGHN: At the compound, but they'll be there. "
3610,"DOCTOR: Right. We must stop them. Brigadier, Brigadier, this is the"
3611,Doctor. Can you still hear me.
3612,
3613,[Aeroplane]
3614,
3615,"BRIGADIER: Yes Doctor, we heard everything. What do"
3616,we do? 
3617,DOCTOR : There are only two possibilities. We must either cut off
3618,the transmitter of the radio beam at the compound or destroy the
3619,Cyberman spaceship. 
3620,BRIGADIER: How much time do we have? 
3621,"DOCTOR : Oh, I've no idea, it could be minutes or hours. Depends"
3622,how long it'll takes them to prepare this bomb of theirs. 
3623,"BRIGADIER: Well, destroying the spaceship is going to take time. Now,"
3624,"we've heard from Captain Turner. The Russians are with us, but they say"
3625,it'll take at least ten hours or more to get a missile that far. 
3626,DOCTOR : Then there's only one chance. The radio beam. Wait.
3627,"Vaughn. Now, Vaughn, will you help us? We must try to get to the"
3628,controls of the radio beam. We'll never do it in time unless you help
3629,us!
3630,
3631, [Vaughn's office]
3632,
3633,VAUGHN: You still think you have a chance? 
3634,"DOCTOR: Yes, if you'll help us! "
3635,VAUGHN: Help you? Why should I? 
3636,"DOCTOR: Well, to save us. To save yourself! "
3637,"VAUGHN: And if I survive, what future have I got? What will the world"
3638,do with me? 
3639,"DOCTOR: Oh, for heaven's sake, stop thinking about yourself! Think of"
3640,the millions of people on earth who are about to die! 
3641,VAUGHN: Appealing to my better nature? No. If I help you it'll be
3642,"because I hate them. The Cybermen, my allies. You think I'm mad, that"
3643,"all I want is power for its own sake. No, I have to have power. The"
3644,"world is weak, vulnerable, a mess of uncoordinated and impossible"
3645,"ideals. It needs a strong man, a single mind. A leader! "
3646,"DOCTOR: Vaughn, will you listen? "
3647,VAUGHN: Right. I'll help you to destroy them because I hate them. They
3648,destroyed my dream. 
3649,BRIGADIER : Doctor? 
3650,"DOCTOR: Yes, Brigadier? "
3651,BRIGADIER : We have a chopper in the area. Can you get up to the
3652,roof? 
3653,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, we'll wait there for you. "
3654,BRIGADIER : Wilco. Out. 
3655,VAUGHN: Your UNIT friends are very efficient. I'll lead the way to the
3656,roof. 
3657,(The Doctor picks up Walter's device.) 
3658,"VAUGHN: No, no, no, I'll take that. The Cybermen will be guarding the"
3659,radio transmitter. 
3660,"DOCTOR: Oh, dear."
3661,
3662,[Aeroplane]
3663,
3664,BRIGADIER: Brigadier to Wing Commander. Get us
3665,airborne and head for the nearest airstrip to the compound area. Red
3666,sector two. 
3667,WING COMMANDER : Wilco. 
3668,"BRIGADIER: Take over, Benton. "
3669,"BENTON: Right, sir. "
3670,ISOBEL: Are we going to go in and help the Doctor? 
3671,BRIGADIER: Ah yes. 
3672,ZOE: He'll need it if he's got to fight his way through two hundred
3673,Cybermen. 
3674,"BRIGADIER: Yes, I only wish we had more time to release more men from"
3675,the Cyber-control. As it is we've only got a platoon. 
3676,TURNER : Captain Turner to UNIT Control. Come in Control. Do you
3677,"read me, over? "
3678,"BENTON: Loud and clear. Hang on, sir! "
3679,"BRIGADIER: Yes, Jimmy. Over. "
3680,TURNER : Hello sir. The Russians have fitted a warhead to the
3681,"rocket now, sir. A super-cooled hydrogen device. It's a solid fuel"
3682,booster so it's nearly ready for liftoff. Over. 
3683,"BRIGADIER: Good, Jimmy, sounds promising. We probably haven't got all"
3684,"that much time, but there's no reason why we shouldn't chuck everything"
3685,we've got at them. Out. 
3686,"WING COMMANDER : Ready for take off, sir. "
3687,BRIGADIER: Take off.
3688,
3689,[Henlow Downs]
3690,
3691,BENTON : All UNIT personnel to flight
3692,"positions. Standard take off procedure. Assault platoon, prepare for"
3693,"action. ETA, fifteen minutes approximately. All mobile UNIT groups"
3694,"proceed to Red sector two area. I say again, all mobile UNIT groups"
3695,proceed to Red sector two area. 
3696,PETERS: Do you think that Russian rocket stands any chance? 
3697,BRANWELL: At that distance? Not enough time. 
3698,"PETERS: No, I suppose not. "
3699,BRANWELL: That's why those Cybermen things are keeping their range.
3700,They know they're safe. 
3701,"PETERS: But you never know, they could take time to get that bomb of"
3702,"theirs ready, and that Russian rocket might make it. "
3703,"BRANWELL: Yeah, it just might. "
3704,"(The rocket and its deadly payload lift off, presumably from"
3705,Krasnoyarsk or somewhere similar.)
3706,
3707,[Aeroplane]
3708,
3709,"BENTON: Sir, Captain Turner reports Russian missile"
3710,on it's way. 
3711,"BRIGADIER: Wish them luck. Now, Captain Turner will be keeping us"
3712,"posted stage by stage, so keep listening, Benton. "
3713,BENTON: Sir. 
3714,PILOT : UNIT sector five chopper to Command. Over. 
3715,BENTON: Command here. Receiving you. Over. 
3716,"PILOT : Coming in to land at the compound, Red sector two. My"
3717,passenger wants a word. Over. 
3718,"BRIGADIER: Yes, Doctor. "
3719,"DOCTOR : Er, Brigadier. We're just coming in to land at the"
3720,compound. 
3721,"BRIGADIER: Yes, well, hang on till we get there. We'll give you"
3722,support. 
3723,"DOCTOR : No, no, I'm sorry, Brigadier. We must go in right away,"
3724,otherwise we'll be too late. 
3725,BRIGADIER: But that's madness. You don't stand a chance against the
3726,Cybermen without us. 
3727,DOCTOR : Don't worry. We have the Professor's machine. It's proved
3728,to be very effective so far. 
3729,"BRIGADIER: Well, don't take any chances. We'll get there as soon as we"
3730,can. Where should we head for? 
3731,DOCTOR: Vaughn says that the transmitter controls are in the old IE
3732,factory. That's on the east side of the compound. 
3733,BRIGADIER: Right. 
3734,"PILOT: Chopper Pilot to Command, sir. Coming down now. What shall I do,"
3735,stick around? Over. 
3736,"BRIGADIER: Yes, hover above them. It'll give us a bearing. "
3737,PILOT: Wilco. Out. 
3738,"BRIGADIER: How long before we touch down, Benton? "
3739,"BENTON: About ten minutes, sir. "
3740,"BRIGADIER: Right, get the men out as soon as we've taxied in. "
3741,"BENTON: Right, sir. Assault platoon prepare for action. Maintain"
3742,constant communication with control on Red alert frequency. 
3743,ZOE: Can we come with you? 
3744,BRIGADIER: Well I don't really think 
3745,ISOBEL: It'll be the last chance I'll get to photograph the Cybermen.
3746,Please. 
3747,BRIGADIER: As long as you keep out of the way. At least I'll be able to
3748,keep an eye on you this time.
3749,
3750,[Factory grounds]
3751,
3752,(The Doctor and Vaughn are making their way to the
3753,building. They spot a Cyberman patrolling and Vaughn readies Watkin's
3754,"device, but the Doctor pulls him back.) "
3755,VAUGHN: What are you doing? We must destroy them! 
3756,DOCTOR: We want to get to the radio transmitter control room. The
3757,Cybermen don't know we're here yet. Let's keep that element of
3758,"surprise. Come on, we'll try down here. "
3759,"(This time there is no avoiding another Cyberman, but Vaughn gets it"
3760,before it can fire its weapon.) 
3761,DOCTOR: Now they know we're here. 
3762,VAUGHN: Right. Up there. We'll go over the roofs. 
3763,(They run up the fire escape and look down on an area where several
3764,Cybermen are standing.) 
3765,VAUGHN: That's it. That's where we've got to get to. Down there. 
3766,[Factory entrance]
3767,
3768,(UNIT and 2nd Battalion Coldsteam Guards arrive.) 
3769,BRIGADIER: There's the chopper. The Doctor's over that way. Follow me! 
3770,"SOLDIER: Yes, sir."
3771,
3772,[Factory rooftop]
3773,
3774,DOCTOR: Look out! 
3775,(Another Cyberman gets treated to a blast of strong emotions. It
3776,tumbles over the edge of the roof and lands with a clang.) 
3777,DOCTOR: Look out! Come on! 
3778,(A group of four Cybermen are coming their way.) 
3779,DOCTOR: Is this the only way down? 
3780,VAUGHN: Yes. 
3781,"DOCTOR: Come on, then. "
3782,(The Doctor and Vaughn go down another ladder.)
3783,
3784,[Factory compound]
3785,
3786,BRIGADIER: Cybermen! Take cover! 
3787,(The army engage the enemy.) 
3788,BRIGADIER: Grenades! 
3789,"(The explosions take out some Cybermen, but the rest keep coming,"
3790,killing the soldiers.) 
3791,BRIGADIER: Bazooka! 
3792,(That is effective too. The Doctor and Vaughn can hear the gunfire.) 
3793,"BRIGADIER: If they come around, move. "
3794,(More grenades and bazooka fire.) 
3795,BRIGADIER: Stop! Forward! 
3796,(Zoe and Isobel accompany the Brigadier as he views the remains of the
3797,enemy.) 
3798,BRIGADIER: And that was just a dozen of them. I'd hate to have to meet
3799,a hundred of them. Forward! 
3800,SOLDIER: Forward! 
3801,(Isobel takes some souvenir pictures. The Doctor and Vaughn come to a
3802,building with a small door.) 
3803,VAUGHN: That's where the main control switch is for the radio beam. 
3804,DOCTOR: There don't seem to be any Cybermen about at all. That's odd. 
3805,"VAUGHN: Well let's not waste time, then. "
3806,"(Vaughn goes up to the small door, as three of Cybermen come out of a"
3807,nearby building.) 
3808,DOCTOR: Look behind you! 
3809,"(Vaughn uses the device and takes out two of them, but the third one"
3810,"fires his weapon and kills him. The Doctor runs, dodging explosions"
3811,from the cyber-weapon. The army arrive.) 
3812,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, get down! "
3813,(The Doctor obeys instantly.) 
3814,"BRIGADIER: Right, bazooka! "
3815,(The Cyberman is killed.) 
3816,"BRIGADIER: You all right, Doctor? "
3817,"DOCTOR: What? Yes, yes, it's there, in that building. The radio"
3818,"transmitter control, you've got to destroy it! "
3819,BRIGADIER: Leave it to us. Forward! 
3820,ISOBEL: Just a second. 
3821,(Isobel takes photographs of the Doctor.) 
3822,"DOCTOR: Oh, but I "
3823,"(As the soldiers run past, the Doctor tries to tidy himself up for the"
3824,camera.) 
3825,ISOBEL: That's it. That's better. Sit still.
3826,
3827,[Aeroplane]
3828,
3829,"BRIGADIER: And for the moment, the crisis is over."
3830,"The radio transmitter's been destroyed, so the Cybermen can no longer"
3831,deliver their bomb. But their spaceship is still sending out its
3832,hypnotic signals. The world is still paralysed.
3833,
3834,[Henlow Downs]
3835,
3836,"BRIGADIER : To stop these signals, we have to"
3837,destroy the Cyberman spaceship. 
3838,PETERS: Sir! 
3839,BRIGADIER : The Russians have already launched a missile which
3840,should arrive on target in approximately six hours from now. 
3841,"BRANWELL: What is it, Sergeant? "
3842,"PETERS: Something on the screen, moving in fast. "
3843,"BRIGADIER : If this is successful, "
3844,PETERS: Look at the size of it! 
3845,"BRIGADIER : Then the world will be released from the Cyber-control,"
3846,and we can mobilise our forces to fight the Cybermen 
3847,BRANWELL: That can only be one thing. The spaceship. 
3848,"BRIGADIER : Remaining on earth. In this case, I'd like all units "
3849,"BRANWELL: Hello, UNIT Control. Hello, UNIT Control. Henlow Downs"
3850,calling UNIT control. Over. 
3851,"BRIGADIER : Yes, Major. "
3852,"BRANWELL: Sorry to interrupt you sir, but we've picked up a large UFO"
3853,approaching Earth.
3854,
3855,[Aeroplane]
3856,
3857,BRANWELL : It's standing off at about fifty
3858,"thousand miles. Outside our range, I'm afraid. Over. "
3859,ZOE: They've moved in. Why? 
3860,"BRIGADIER: Thank you, Major. Out. Get Captain Turner. "
3861,"BENTON: Right, sir. UNIT Control calling Captain Turner. UNIT Control"
3862,calling Captain Turner. Do you read me? 
3863,"BRIGADIER: Why do you think they've moved their spaceship in so close,"
3864,Doctor? 
3865,BENTON: UNIT Control calling Captain Turner. UNIT Control calling
3866,Captain Turner. Do you read me? 
3867,DOCTOR: I'm not sure. Possibly to try to avoid the Russian missile or 
3868,BRIGADIER: Or to deliver their bomb by other means. 
3869,BENTON: UNIT Control calling Captain Turner. UNIT control Calling
3870,Captain Turner. Do you read me? 
3871,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid so. You see, from where they were, let's say"
3872,"two hundred and thirty thousand miles out in space, their conventional"
3873,"missiles couldn't deliver the bomb, so they had to come in close. "
3874,"ZOE: But in moving in fifty thousand miles, they've come into range of"
3875,"the Russian missiles. Well, it can't be more than a few miles from"
3876,them. 
3877,DOCTOR: But it's going in the opposite direction! 
3878,TURNER : Captain Turner here. Over. 
3879,"BENTON: Here we are, sir. "
3880,"BRIGADIER: Yes, Jimmy. "
3881,TURNER : Sir. Sorry about the delay but we've had a bit of a flap
3882,on here. 
3883,"BRIGADIER: Yes, we know. Can the Russians turn their missile? "
3884,"TURNER : Yes, sir. "
3885,BRIGADIER: How long before it strikes? 
3886,"TURNER : They estimate twelve point five minutes, sir. "
3887,"BRIGADIER: Thank you, Jimmy. Out. That's more than time enough for them"
3888,"to deliver their bomb and move out to safety, isn't it? "
3889,"DOCTOR: Yes, Brigadier, I'm afraid it is. "
3890,"BRIGADIER: Yes, well, this is going to be a long twelve minutes. "
3891,(The clock moves from two twenty to two twenty six. The only sound is
3892,Benton knocking over his tea mug.) 
3893,"BENTON: Sorry, sir."
3894,
3895,[Henlow Downs]
3896,
3897,PETERS: There it is. The Russian missile. 
3898,BRANWELL: Thank heavens for that. I'll tell UNIT control. 
3899,PETERS: Ah! Must be the Cybermen's bomb. 
3900,BRANWELL: Red alert procedure! Raise all missiles! 
3901,[Aeroplane]
3902,
3903,BRANWELL : It'll be in range in about thirty
3904,"seconds, sir. It's travelling fast but we stand a good chance of"
3905,picking it off. Over. 
3906,"BRIGADIER: How about the Cyber-spaceship, is that still there? "
3907,"BRANWELL : Still there, sir. If they don't shift soon that Russian"
3908,missile will hit it right on the button. 
3909,BRIGADIER: Let's hope so.
3910,
3911,[Henlow Downs]
3912,
3913,PETERS: Coming into range sir. 
3914,"BRANWELL: Must go, sir. Over and out. "
3915,PETERS: Fifteen seconds. 
3916,"BRANWELL: Right. Let's get it first time, lads! "
3917,"PETERS: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six "
3918,(Branwell arms the system.) 
3919,"PETERS: Five, four, three, two, one, zero! "
3920,(A missile zooms away.) 
3921,PETERS: She's going wide! 
3922,BRANWELL: Prepare two! 
3923,"PETERS: Two away, and it looks good. "
3924,"BRANWELL: Splendid! Stand by three, just in case. "
3925,PETERS: Standing by. 
3926,PETERS: Ten seconds and it's on the button! It's on the button! We've
3927,done it! 
3928,"BRANWELL: Hello, UNIT Control. Hello, UNIT Control. Henlow Downs"
3929,calling UNIT Control. Over. 
3930,"PETERS: Sir, the Russian missile, it's almost on top of the spaceship!"
3931,I think they've got her! 
3932,(KaBOOM!) 
3933,[Lounge]
3934,
3935,(Back at the house Professor Walters is renting
3936,from Professor Travers - another photographic session is underway.) 
3937,ISOBEL: Tired? 
3938,"ZOE: No, exhausted! "
3939,"ISOBEL: Okay, you can take a breather. "
3940,ZOE: Thanks. 
3941,ISOBEL: Thank goodness I don't have to do any more modelling for a
3942,living. 
3943,"ZOE: What is this new job of yours, then? "
3944,"ISOBEL: Well, because of my photographs of the Cybermen in action, I've"
3945,got an exclusive contract with a publishing group. So I'll be
3946,"travelling all over the world, snapping away with my little black box."
3947,What will you do now? 
3948,"ZOE: Oh, when the Doctor's finished making his circuits, we'll be off"
3949,"again, I suppose. "
3950,ISOBEL: Where to? 
3951,"ZOE: Well, we're never really sure. "
3952,(Turner enters.) 
3953,TURNER: Hello. 
3954,ISOBEL: Ah! Here comes my dolly soldier. 
3955,"TURNER: Cheeky. Zoe, the Doctor says he's almost ready to leave. I've"
3956,got the Jeep outside. 
3957,ZOE: Oh fine. But what about Jamie? 
3958,"TURNER: Oh, he's all right. He's just having a check-up at the"
3959,hospital. We'll pick him up on the way. 
3960,"ISOBEL: Well, can I come with you? "
3961,TURNER: As long as you promise not to call me your dolly soldier in
3962,"front of the Brigadier, yes. Come on. "
3963,"ZOE: Right, come on!"
3964,
3965,[Field]
3966,
3967,"(Turner drives Isobel, the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe"
3968,back to where they parked the invisible Tardis.) 
3969,ISOBEL: Here? 
3970,"DOCTOR: Yes. This is fine, thank you. "
3971,TURNER: A field? There's nothing here. 
3972,"ZOE: Are you sure this is the place, Doctor? "
3973,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Well I'm very much obliged to you, Captain. "
3974,"TURNER: Oh, goodbye. "
3975,"DOCTOR: Goodbye to you. Goodbye, Isobel. Goodbye, everyone. Come along,"
3976,Jamie. 
3977,"(They all exchange farewells and the Doctor, Zoe and Jamie go through"
3978,the gate into the field proper.) 
3979,ISOBEL: Why are they going into that field? 
3980,TURNER: I've no idea. 
3981,"DOCTOR: Now, then, where exactly did we leave it? You two try over"
3982,there. 
3983,(The travellers spread their arms wide in a game of reverse blind-man's
3984,bluff to find the Tardis.) 
3985,ISOBEL: What's he doing? 
3986,TURNER: Search me. 
3987,(The Doctor scratches his head and discovers that his elbow has
3988,disappeared. The invisibility field obviously extends a couple of
3989,inches beyond the Tardis exterior. He unlocks it and goes inside. The
3990,engine starts up and the Tardis appears. The Doctor steps outside.) 
3991,"DOCTOR: There we are, all done and ready to go. Bye bye. Bye! "
3992,ZOE: Bye. 
3993,JAMIE: Bye. 
3994,ISOBEL: A police box? I don't believe it. 
3995,"(Jamie, Zoe and the Doctor enter the Tardis, and it dematerialises.) "
