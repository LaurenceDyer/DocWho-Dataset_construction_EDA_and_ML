24,IAN: Perhaps we've landed on top of something. 
25,DOCTOR: Yes. 
26,BARBARA: Or inside something. 
27,"DOCTOR: Hmm? This says everything has stopped, but the ship. "
28,"SUSAN: What did you mean, Barbara, inside something? "
29,IAN: Perhaps that's why we still appear to be moving. 
30,"BARBARA: Try the scanner, Doctor. "
31,"DOCTOR: Covered with static. Let's try it again, Susan. "
32,(The screen is just streaks of static) 
33,IAN: That could be caused by an unsuppressed motor. 
34,"DOCTOR: Yes, or a magnetic field. "
35,"SUSAN: Shall we go outside, Grandfather? "
36,"DOCTOR: No, I shan't be happy until I've solved this little mystery. "
37,BARBARA: I don't know why we ever bother to leave the ship. 
38,DOCTOR: You're still thinking about the experiences you had with the
39,Aztecs. 
40,"BARBARA: No, I've got over that now. "
41,"IAN: There's one thing about it, Doctor. We're certainly different from"
42,when we started out with you. 
43,SUSAN: That's funny. Grandfather and I were talking about that just
44,before you came in. How you've both changed. 
45,BARBARA: Well we've all changed. 
46,SUSAN: Have I? 
47,BARBARA: Yes. 
48,"DOCTOR: Yes, it all started out as a mild curiosity in a junkyard, and"
49,"now it's turned out to be quite a, quite a great spirit of adventure,"
50,don't you think? 
51,IAN: Yes. We've had some pretty rough times and even that doesn't stop
52,"us. It's a wonderful thing, this ship of yours, Doctor. Taken us back"
53,"to prehistoric times, the Daleks. "
54,"SUSAN: Marco Polo, Marinus. "
55,BARBARA: And the Aztecs. 
56,"DOCTOR: Yes, and that extraordinary quarrel I had with that English"
57,"king, Henry the Eighth. You know, he threw a parson's nose at me. "
58,BARBARA: What did you do? 
59,"DOCTOR: Threw it back, of course. Take them to the Tower, he said."
60,That's why I did it. 
61,BARBARA: Why? 
62,SUSAN: The Tardis was inside the Tower. 
63,"DOCTOR: Of course, it was long before you appeared on the scene."
64,"However, now, let us get back to this little problem. Open the door,"
65,Susan. 
66,"IAN: Have you checked everything, Doctor? "
67,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Plenty of fresh air, temperature normal. "
68,"BARBARA: Oh, just the unknown, then. "
69,DOCTOR: Precisely. 
70, [Control room] 
71, (They walk out into a room with people in uniform
72,"sitting in chairs, very still) "
73,"IAN: You were right, Barbara. We have landed in something. "
74,"DOCTOR: It's a spaceship. Close the door, Susan. Let us be careful."
75,There's been some kind of catastrophe here. 
76,"(Ian takes the pulse of one man. He's intact, flexible, but) "
77,IAN: Dead. 
78,SUSAN: This one's a girl. 
79,BARBARA: I'm afraid she's the same. What could have happened? I can't
80,see a wound or anything. 
81,"IAN: Suffocation, Doctor? "
82,"DOCTOR: I never make uninformed guesses, my friend, but certainly"
83,"that's one answer. Oh, dear, dear, dear, what a tragedy you know. She's"
84,only a few years older than Susan. 
85,"SUSAN: Grandfather, let's go back to the Tardis. "
86,DOCTOR: Why? 
87,SUSAN: I don't know. I've got a feeling about this. 
88,"BARBARA: Yes, I can sense something too. "
89,IAN: You mean that whatever it was killed them could kill us? 
90,"DOCTOR: Chesterton, have you noticed anything about this watch? (and"
91,the man's) Neither of them are working. These are the non-winding type.
92,A movement of the wrist recharges the spring inside for twenty four
93,hours. 
94,"IAN: Yes, and they both stopped at about three o'clock. "
95,"DOCTOR: Yes, then suppose we say that they've only just stopped. Now"
96,that would mean that the last movement of their wrists would be at
97,least twenty four hours ago. 
98,"SUSAN: Grandfather, he's still warm. "
99,BARBARA: Then they've only just died. 
100,"DOCTOR: It doesn't make sense, does it. But the facts are all here. I"
101,think it would be wise if we returned to the ship and left these
102,people. There's nothing we can do for them. 
103,"BARBARA: No, we can't even bury them. "
104,"DOCTOR: Come along, open the door, Susan. "
105,(The man groans and slumps forward over his desk) 
106,"IAN: His heart had stopped beating, Doctor. He was dead. "
107,MAITLAND: (something) 
108,IAN: What do you want? Yes? 
109,MAITLAND: Over there. 
110,IAN: Where? There? 
111,MAITLAND: Behind you. 
112,IAN: Here? 
113,"MAITLAND: No, on the left. "
114,"IAN: What, this? (a metal box) "
115,"MAITLAND: Yes, that. "
116,"(Ian gives it to him, and a heartbeat starts up) "
117,MAITLAND: Carol. Place this against Carol's chest. 
118,"BARBARA: I'm sorry, Carol's dead. "
119,"MAITLAND: Please, do as I ask. "
120,(The heartbeat sound and she wakes up) 
121,IAN: You were both dead. 
122,"SUSAN: Grandfather, what was in that box? "
123,"MAITLAND: It's a heart resuscitator. When you found us, we were in a"
124,"very long sleep, but we weren't dead. My name is Maitland. This is"
125,"Carol Richmond, my co-astronaut. "
126,"DOCTOR: Tell me, are you from the Earth? "
127,MAITLAND: Yes. 
128,BARBARA: So are we. How's it looking? 
129,"CAROL: The Earth, do you mean? "
130,BARBARA: Yes. 
131,CAROL: Still too much air traffic. 
132,"IAN: They got it off the roads, did they? "
133,"MAITLAND: You might say that, yes. "
134,"IAN: Barbara and I, we come from London. Tell me, is Big Ben still on"
135,time? 
136,"MAITLAND: What century do you come from? The twenty first, perhaps? "
137,"BARBARA: No, the twentieth. "
138,MAITLAND: I see. 
139,CAROL: What's Big Ben? 
140,"BARBARA: Well, it's a clock. Near Westminster Abbey. "
141,"MAITLAND: Yes, you see, the whole lower half of England is called"
142,Central City now. There hasn't been a London for four hundred years. We
143,come from the twenty eighth century. 
144,"CAROL: Captain Maitland, these people must leave immediately. "
145,"MAITLAND: Yes, you will have to. "
146,IAN: But there are so many things we want to know. 
147,MAITLAND: There's only danger here for you. You must go. 
148,BARBARA: Danger? What sort of danger? 
149,MAITLAND: It's better that you don't know what happened to us. 
150,BARBARA: But we might be able to help you. 
151,"DOCTOR: No. No, Barbara. I learned not to meddle in other people's"
152,"affairs years ago. (Ian laughs) Now, now, now, don't be absurd. There's"
153,"not an ounce of curiosity in me, my dear boy. Tell me, why are you in"
154,danger? 
155,"MAITLAND: Very well, I'll try to explain. Out there is a planet we call"
156,"the Sensphere. The creatures on it, the Sensorites, have always"
157,prevented us from leaving this area of space. 
158,DOCTOR: You mean they have some kind of power over your craft. 
159,MAITLAND: Exactly. But it's not that simple. They not only control our
160,"craft, they have some influence over us as well. "
161,"DOCTOR: Hypnosis, do you mean? "
162,"MAITLAND: No, I do not mean hypnosis. "
163,"DOCTOR: Well, what then? "
164,MAITLAND: Somehow they have some control over our brains. They are
165,"hostile, these Sensorites, but in the strangest possible way. They"
166,won't let us leave this area of space yet they don't attempt to kill
167,us. 
168,SUSAN: What had happened when we found you? 
169,CAROL: The same thing that's happened many times before. The Sensorites
170,"have put us into a deep sleep that gives the appearance of death, and"
171,yet they've never made any actual effort to destroy us. 
172,MAITLAND: Far from it. We both have very hazy recollections of them
173,returning from time to time to our ship to actually feed us. 
174,IAN: Doesn't add up at all. 
175,CAROL: This is why you must leave us at once. 
176,MAITLAND: Yes. The Sensorites may try to prevent you from leaving. 
177,(An alien hand holds a device over the Tardis lock) 
178,BARBARA: I can smell something burning. 
179,SUSAN: So can I. 
180,MAITLAND: You mustn't delay any longer. 
181,"IAN: I'm inclined to agree with him, Doctor. But surely there's"
182,something we can do for you? 
183,MAITLAND: No. Nobody can help us. 
184,"SUSAN: Grandfather, couldn't we take them back with us? "
185,MAITLAND: We cannot leave this ship. 
186,"CAROL: You see, there's John to think of too. "
187,DOCTOR: John? 
188,"BARBARA: Ian, there is something burning. "
189,"IAN: Yes, I think you're right. Maitland, you wouldn't have anything"
190,"shorting, would you? "
191,"MAITLAND: No, that's not possible. "
192,"(Amid smoke, the alien hand withdraws the Tardis lock mechanism from"
193,the door) 
194,BARBARA: It seems to be coming from over here. 
195,"DOCTOR: You have additional crew, I take it? "
196,CAROL: Yes. 
197,"MAITLAND: Doctor, you must go. Leave us. "
198,"DOCTOR: Well, it seems to me that there's nothing else I can do."
199,"Goodbye, my friend. Bye, bye, my child. Come along, Susan. "
200,SUSAN: Goodbye. 
201,"BARBARA: It's stronger over here, Doctor. "
202,DOCTOR: Oh? Perhaps it's coming from inside the Tardis. 
203,SUSAN: Grandfather! 
204,DOCTOR: Good gracious! They've taken the lock! 
205,"SUSAN: It's not so much the lock, it's the opening mechanism. The"
206,door's permanently locked! 
207,IAN: Permanently? But there must be some way of getting in? What can we
208,"do, Doctor? Break down the door? "
209,DOCTOR: And disturb the field dimensions inside the Tardis? We dare
210,not. We've been most effectively shut out. 
211,BARBARA: The Sensorites? 
212,DOCTOR: Who else? 
213,SUSAN: What do they want with us? 
214,DOCTOR: I don't know. And why have they kept those other two in
215,"captivity, hmm? "
216,(the ship shakes) 
217,CAROL: The Sensorites! Get back! Get away! 
218,IAN: Must get up the other end. 
219,"DOCTOR: What is happening, my friend? Can't you control the ship? "
220,MAITLAND: I'm powerless. The Sensorites are stronger than I am. 
221,DOCTOR: Which is your parallel thrust? 
222,MAITLAND: There. 
223,"DOCTOR: Right. Velocity, Chesterton. Check velocity. "
224,"IAN: It's not even on the unit marker, Doctor. "
225,"MAITLAND: Don't try and control the spacecraft. It's suicide, I tell"
226,you. 
227,DOCTOR: Please go away. 
228,"IAN: The velocity needle's hitting the red, Doctor. "
229,"DOCTOR: Right, stabilisers, Maitland. "
230,(The ship stops shaking) 
231,"DOCTOR: Oh, at last. At last. The ship was rolling about on its axis. "
232,"SUSAN: Grandfather, look! We're heading straight for it. "
233,CAROL: It's the Sense-Sphere. 
234,DOCTOR: Where's your deflection rays? Maitland! Deflection rays. 
235,"MAITLAND: There, the white panel. But it's useless. "
236,"DOCTOR: Well, we'll see about that. We'll see about that. Reading,"
237,please. 
238,"CAROL: Mach three, braking one. "
239,IAN: Nineteen miles to the nearest point of impact. 
240,CAROL: Closing fast. 
241,"SUSAN: Barbara, we're going to hit. We're going to hit! "
242,CAROL: Lifting slightly. 
243,MAITLAND: You're on collision course. 
244,DOCTOR: Jet. Jet course. Port. Now. 
245,IAN: Velocity still rising. 
246,DOCTOR: Jet reverse. Starboard. Now. 
247,CAROL: Increasing to mach four. Heading straight for point of impact. 
248,IAN: The altitude is still falling. 
249,CAROL: Mach four. 
250,"DOCTOR: Barbara, see that panel? Check status. Three lights normal. "
251,BARBARA: Yes. Three lights on. 
252,DOCTOR: Boost engines. Forward thrust and lock. 
253,"(The planet fills the viewscreen, then they veer off to the left) "
254,MAITLAND: Why couldn't I do it? 
255,(later) 
256,"DOCTOR: Well, my friend, are you feeling better? "
257,"MAITLAND: Yes, my head's much clearer. "
258,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I rather fancy that's settled that little bit of"
259,"solution. You know, I think these Sensorites have found a way to take"
260,control of your minds. 
261,"IAN: Do you think they were deliberately trying to kill us, Doctor? "
262,"DOCTOR: No, no, I don't. I think it was an exercise in fear and power. "
263,"CAROL: Yes, but for some reason or other your minds aren't open to"
264,them. 
265,"DOCTOR: Yes, and you found a way to resist them, whereas Maitland here,"
266,his power to resist was taken from him. 
267,MAITLAND: I was afraid. 
268,IAN: You weren't afraid. They just made you hopeless. 
269,"DOCTOR: Yes, they're dangerous and cunning, these people. But that's"
270,"not all. Things are very strange here. You know, they can control, they"
271,"can frighten and yet they don't attempt to kill you. Furthermore, they"
272,feed you and keep you alive. All this is most extraordinary. 
273,"IAN: Yes. Talking about food, I shall be glad when we eat. How's it"
274,coming along? 
275,BARBARA: All right. Be ready in a minute. 
276,SUSAN: Iron rations a la carte. 
277,"CAROL: Well, from the size of our stocks, they've obviously been giving"
278,us their own food. 
279,"BARBARA: What about water, Carol? "
280,CAROL: Down there on the right. 
281,"BARBARA: Right, we'll find it. "
282,"DOCTOR: Tell me, have either of you ever met any of these creatures or"
283,seen them? 
284,CAROL: John has. 
285,"IAN: Ah, he's the other member of your crew, isn't he. "
286,"MAITLAND: Yes, our mineralogist. "
287,DOCTOR: I'd like to have a talk with him. 
288,MAITLAND: I'm afraid that's out of the question. 
289,DOCTOR: Oh? Why not? 
290,MAITLAND: I'd rather not talk about it. 
291,(Barbara and Susan walk past the tank marked water to a hatch) 
292,BARBARA: I suppose she meant the water was through this door. Let's try
293,it. 
294,SUSAN: I can't see any handle on the door. Try this. That doesn't work.
295,
296,(then she spots the electric eye and waves her hand in front of it. The
297,hatch opens) 
298,"SUSAN: That's funny. Oh, I see, it's the ray. I must have broken the"
299,connection. 
300,BARBARA: Let's get that water. I'm dying of thirst. 
301,"SUSAN: Yes, so am I. "
302, [Corridor] 
303, (They step through the hatch) 
304,"BARBARA: Well, down here on the right, she said. "
305,(And another hand shuts the hatch behind them. It belongs to a
306,shuffling man with a glazed expression) 
307, [Cabin] 
308, (The women find a small room) 
309,BARBARA: I don't think we should stay in here. 
310,"SUSAN: (picking up a book) Hey, this is bliss. "
311,BARBARA: I wonder where that water is? 
312,SUSAN: I don't know. 
313,BARBARA: Shh. Listen. 
314,(The shuffling footsteps come closer) 
315, [Control room] 
316, IAN: Don't you see? John may be able to give us
317,some valuable information. 
318,CAROL: I told you. You can't see him. 
319,DOCTOR: You're both being rather secretive. 
320,IAN: Where are the others? 
321,(Maitland rushes to the hatch and tries to open it) 
322,MAITLAND: We should have warned them. 
323,IAN: What is it? What's wrong? 
324,CAROL: The door's been locked on the other side. Quickly. They're in
325,danger. We must get in from the other end. 
326, [Corridor] 
327, MAITLAND: This way. This is the other way through.
328,
329,"CAROL: Oh, it's no use. The ray's been jammed on the other side. "
330,"MAITLAND: I'm sorry, Ian. There's nothing we can do. "
331,IAN: But what is it? What's wrong? What's going on inside there? 
332,"MAITLAND: It's no use, no use. "
333,IAN: Barbara! Susan! 
334,"CAROL: No! No, please. No! "
335,IAN: Are there Sensorites in there? 
336, [Cabin] 
337, (The shuffling man comes right up to Barbara and
338,"Susan, they step to one side and he falls over. They run back down the"
339,corridor but the hatch doesn't open for them. They duck into a store
340,room instead) 
341, [Store room] 
342, (The man comes in as they hide behind the filing
343,"cabinet, and starts crying, then staggers out again without seeing"
344,them) 
345, [Control room] 
346, CAROL: We must find out about John. 
347,"MAITLAND: We've been over this a hundred times before, Carol. "
348,CAROL: But the other times were different. The Sensorites made our
349,decisions for us. 
350,MAITLAND: As far as we know they still do. 
351,CAROL: But the Doctor and the others showed us we can resist them. We
352,"can! It's only fear that makes us weak, that's all. "
353,"MAITLAND: That may be so, but we mustn't go in there, Carol. It's too"
354,dangerous. 
355,"CAROL: What you really mean is, I mustn't go in there. You're afraid"
356,"for me, aren't you? "
357,MAITLAND: I know what John means to you. 
358,"CAROL: The last time I saw him, he didn't even know my name. I must see"
359,"him. I must find out. Besides, there are the girls. "
360,MAITLAND: All right. 
361,"IAN: Maitland, you must get that door opened. "
362,"MAITLAND: Yes, I'll have to cut round the lock. "
363,"IAN: All right, well get on with it. "
364,MAITLAND: I'll get the machine rigged up. 
365,"IAN: Carol, tell me. What is it that you're both afraid of? "
366,CAROL: John's in there with your friends. He and I were going to get
367,married when we got back to the Earth. The Sensorites attacked him far
368,more than Captain Maitland and me. I had to sit there helplessly and
369,watch him get worse and worse. 
370,IAN: You mean they've taken over his mind. 
371,CAROL: Yes. 
372,"IAN: What's it done to him? Carol, you've got to tell me. "
373,CAROL: He'll be frightened of strangers. He may become violent. 
374, [Corridor] 
375," (Barbara and Susan sneak out of the storage room,"
376,but don't see John leaning against the wall. He pushes a lever then
377,shuffles after them. They cannot open any other doors. Just as they
378,"think he's going to attack them, he falls to his knees) "
379,SUSAN: He's crying. 
380,JOHN: Who are you? You look like my sister. Have you come to help me?
381,Four years. 
382,BARBARA: Are you one of the crew of the spaceship? You want to tell me
383,something? About yourself? 
384,SUSAN: Is he trying to say he's ill? 
385,JOHN: Yes. Ill. 
386,BARBARA: (comforting him) Don't be afraid. We'll take care of you. 
387,"SUSAN: What do you think happened to him, Barbara? "
388, [Control room] 
389, (Maitland is cutting into the door with a sonic
390,device) 
391,IAN: Where's the power come from? 
392,MAITLAND: Electro-magnectics. We should be to the locks very soon. 
393,IAN: You say you haven't seen John for months? 
394,CAROL: He was dangerous once the Sensorites got at his brain. 
395,DOCTOR: Can't you go faster? Susan's in there. 
396,MAITLAND: It won't be long now. 
397,"(There's a noise, Maitland stops) "
398,"DOCTOR: Now what is it? Get on with the job, please. "
399,"MAITLAND: Listen, don't you hear it? I thought there was something"
400,else. 
401,IAN: You mean that high-pitched whine? Is that it? 
402,MAITLAND: Sensorites. 
403,CAROL: They must be near. That noise is caused by the machines that
404,carry them through space. 
405,"MAITLAND: Carol, get back to your instruments. Doctor, would you take"
406,the controller seat? 
407,DOCTOR: Anything but this awful waiting. 
408,IAN: What about Barbara and Susan.
409,MAITLAND: There's no time now. Look for glowing lights on the move
410,about the ship. 
411,IAN: How will they attack us? 
412,MAITLAND: They won't. Not in the normal way. 
413,IAN: Then how can we defend ourselves. 
414,MAITLAND: You'll find out soon enough. Look out there. There they are!
415,See them moving? 
416,"IAN: Yes, but they look miles away. "
417,MAITLAND: It won't take them long to get here. 
418,"IAN: How long do you think it'll take them, Doctor? "
419,DOCTOR: I don't know. They must have made the journey before. They were
420,"here before, remember? They took away the lock mechanism from my ship. "
421,IAN: Yes. Probably took it back to their own planet. 
422,"DOCTOR: Yes, and now they're coming back, with what orders? To take"
423,over our minds? Hmm? Or to kill us? 
424, [Corridor] 
425, BARBARA: Do you hear that? 
426,SUSAN: It's coming from outside. 
427,"BARBARA: No, you need rest. There's nothing wrong. "
428,JOHN: I'll protect you. 
429,BARBARA: Yes. All right. You'll protect us. 
430, [Control room] 
431, IAN: Would it be a good idea to move? 
432,MAITLAND: Where to? We already know we can't leave this area of space. 
433,"IAN: All the same, I think "
434,"MAITLAND: Anyway, we're not going to be destroyed. Had the Sensorites"
435,"intended that, they would have done so long ago. "
436,"IAN: If that collision course was their idea of a joke, I'd hate to be"
437,one of their enemies. 
438,CAROL: They wouldn't really try to crash us. They just keep on playing
439,this game of nerves. 
440,DOCTOR: What's that noise? 
441,"MAITLAND: Yes, we always hear that. "
442,CAROL: Interference now on all our scans. 
443,"MAITLAND: Now remember, all of you, no violence unless the Sensorites"
444,start it first. 
445,IAN: Why no violence? Surely we've got the right to protect ourselves? 
446,"DOCTOR: My dear Chesterton. It's our minds that they take over, so we"
447,must presume that the brain is all important. Now let our own
448,"intelligence be our own defence, and attack. "
449,(It goes quiet) 
450,CAROL: I can sense them all around us now. 
451,MAITLAND: Shh. 
452,IAN: Doctor. Doctor. 
453,(A bulbous-headed humanoid is gazing at them from the outside of the
454,ship) 
455, Episode Two - The
456,Unwilling Warriors 
457, [Control room] 
458," DOCTOR: Steady, Chesterton. The calmer you are,"
459,the stronger. 
460,"IAN: Doctor, look at these two. "
461,"DOCTOR: Maitland. Maitland! Can you hear me? Fear, my boy. It's"
462,loosened his mind. It gives the Sensorites a chance to control it. 
463,"IAN: Doctor, that thing's still out there. "
464,"DOCTOR: Oh, ignore it. Maitland! "
465,MAITLAND: Yes. I hear you. 
466,"DOCTOR: There's work to be done, my boy. Work. Understand? "
467,MAITLAND: Work. 
468,IAN: He's responding. 
469,"DOCTOR: Yes, a door to be opened. "
470,MAITLAND: A door? Yes. 
471,DOCTOR: Danger on the other side. 
472,"MAITLAND: John. Yes, we must get the two girls out. "
473,"DOCTOR: Good, good, good. "
474, [Corridor] 
475, BARBARA: All we want you to do is open the door. 
476,JOHN: No. I'll protect you. 
477,SUSAN: But our friends are out there. 
478,JOHN: They're dead. All dead. 
479,BARBARA: But we were just with them. 
480,SUSAN: Just a few minutes ago. What is it? 
481,JOHN: They're here. Inside here. 
482,"BARBARA: John, open the door. "
483,"JOHN: Frighten them? No, I can't do that. No. No. "
484,SUSAN: Somebody's talking to him. Inside his mind. 
485,"JOHN: No, don't force me. You can't. I won't do it. My head! Pain."
486,(unintelligible) 
487,"SUSAN: Somebody's ordering him to do something, I know they are."
488,Something to harm us. 
489, [Control room] 
490, (At the hatchway) 
491,MAITLAND: I'll have to use the cutter. 
492,"IAN: Oh, not again. How long will this take? "
493,MAITLAND: It's the only way. 
494,"IAN: Yes, I know. Just that I'm so worried about Barbara and Susan. "
495,"DOCTOR: Now, now, now. Try and contain your emotions. Use self-control."
496,Otherwise it confuses the brain and leaves it wide open to an attack by
497,the Sensorites. Look at Maitland here. Fear and inertia left him
498,vulnerable. 
499,"IAN: Yes, it's true enough, Doctor. "
500,CAROL: The Sensorites are in the ship now. 
501,IAN: What? How did they get here? 
502,CAROL: Through the loading bay. 
503,DOCTOR: But that can't be where Barbara and Susan are now? 
504,"CAROL: No, but we must get to them as soon as possible. "
505,IAN: Nobody's arguing about that. 
506,DOCTOR: But that man John's with them. 
507,CAROL: The Sensorites have control over John's mind. They may force him
508,to obey their orders. 
509,IAN: How's it coming. 
510,"MAITLAND: Slowly, but it's working. "
511,IAN: If only we knew what was happening on the other side of this door.
512,Barbara! Susan! 
513, [Corridor] 
514, (They can hear Ian thumping on the hatch) 
515,SUSAN: Listen. It's coming from outside. 
516,"BARBARA: Yes, I can just hear it. It must be Ian trying to get through."
517,
518,SUSAN: Yes. 
519,JOHN: Give me your hand. They want me to frighten you. I mustn't give
520,way. 
521,"SUSAN: He's so tense, Barbara. Can't we help him? "
522,"BARBARA: John, we're not afraid. "
523,JOHN: You're not afraid? 
524,BARBARA: Not while we have you to protect us. 
525,SUSAN: It's quiet and peaceful here. There's no real danger. 
526,JOHN: The Sensorites. 
527,"BARBARA: We're your friends, John. "
528,"JOHN: Friends. No, they are my friends! "
529,"SUSAN: Barbara, I've got an idea. "
530,BARBARA: What? 
531,"SUSAN: He's quiet now, but we can't be sure the Sensorites won't make"
532,"him help them. Look, if they can use their brains, why can't we use"
533,ours? 
534,BARBARA: To defend him? 
535,"SUSAN: Yes, and ourselves. Grandfather and I landed on a planet once"
536,called Esto. The plants there used thought transference. If you stood
537,"in between two of the plants, they set up a sort of screeching noise."
538,Grandfather said it was because they were aware of another mind. 
539,BARBARA: Breaking in on their communications. 
540,"SUSAN: Yes, exactly. I thought if we both tried together. "
541,BARBARA: Well anything's better than just sitting here. 
542,JOHN: Sensorites! They're near us now. 
543,SUSAN: You see? If we both think of the same thing at the same time. 
544,BARBARA: What do you mean? We defy you. Something like that? 
545,"SUSAN: Yes. Yes, we defy you. We've got to picture the words very"
546,clearly in our minds. We must both concentrate very hard. Ready? 
547,"BARBARA: Yes. When I count to five. One, (cut to Sensorites) four,"
548,five. 
549,"(The Sensorites clutch their big heads in pain, then Susan faints) "
550, [Control room] 
551, (Maitland starts to lift the hatch) 
552,"MAITLAND: Oh, it's jammed. I'll have to cut the whole section out. "
553,IAN: We can't wait. I'll give you a hand. Ready? 
554,MAITLAND: That's it. 
555,IAN: It's going. 
556,"(And they push the hatch door up and open, and go in)"
557,(Later - ) 
558,"DOCTOR: Yes, it might be possible for Susan's thoughts to reach out to"
559,the Sensorites. 
560,CAROL: So we really can resist them? 
561,"DOCTOR: Yes. And there's that friend of yours, you know. John. We must"
562,"look after him. Let me see now. Of course, they have a hold of his"
563,"mind, you know. "
564,CAROL: He's sleeping peacefully now. 
565,"DOCTOR: Yes, I wonder. Did Susan release the pressure? "
566,"SUSAN: I had hundreds of voices in my mind, Grandfather. "
567,"DOCTOR: Yes, and that was a dangerous thing to do, child. Because you"
568,"were strong-willed and without fear, they didn't harm you. "
569,MAITLAND: He's resting now. Did you know his hair was almost white? 
570,DOCTOR: There's nothing wrong with that. 
571,"MAITLAND: In a man of thirty, Doctor? And he looks so old. Why have the"
572,Sensorites done this? What do they want from us? 
573,DOCTOR: I 
574,"IAN: Doctor. John muttered something just now, before he passed out."
575,"Sounded like, the dreams of avarice. Now, on Earth we have a saying."
576,Rich beyond the dreams of avarice. I think he's discovered something.
577,Would explain why he's had the worst of it from the Sensorites. 
578,DOCTOR: Yes. What were John's duties? 
579,MAITLAND: He's our mineralogist. 
580,IAN: You see? Makes sense. John mumbling something about riches. I
581,think he must have discovered something that the Sensorites wanted to
582,"keep secret, so they silenced him and kept all of you prisoners about"
583,their planet. 
584,DOCTOR: I see. And now they're trying to do the same to us. We must get
585,the lock of the Tardis back. Have you tried talking to them? 
586,MAITLAND: Talking to them? 
587,"DOCTOR: Yes, we must try. We must. "
588, [Loading bay] 
589," (The Sensorites look the same, with beards that"
590,grow upwards to hide their mouths) 
591,"SENSORITE 1: (soft-spoken, holding a microphone to his forehead) The"
592,first elder is communicating. Be alert while I listen. Yes. The first
593,elder is interested in human voice that said we defy you. 
594,SENSORITE 2: (a deeper voice) The human creatures who are newly arrived
595,seem to possess more intelligence than the others. 
596,SENSORITE 1: The first elder said that they have less fear of us. We
597,"are to stay here and watch, and listen to them closely. If they try to"
598,"attack us with force, we are to summon our warriors to destroy them. "
599, [Control room] 
600," MAITLAND: One spectroscope, Doctor. "
601,DOCTOR: So I see. 
602,CAROL: I do remember he was beginning to take a reading of the minerals
603,in the vicinity. 
604,BARBARA: And then what happened? 
605,CAROL: That was the first time the Sensorites attacked us. 
606,DOCTOR: Would you like to look at that graph for a moment? 
607,"IAN: Yes. Oh, there's nothing much here. Very ordinary collection of"
608,"things. Oxygen, hydrogen, sodium. "
609,SUSAN: What's that? 
610,"IAN: It's a spectrograph, Susan. You see these lines? They represent"
611,the emission wavelengths. 
612,"SUSAN: Oh, yes, of course. "
613,"IAN: No, there certainly isn't anything very special indicated on this."
614,
615,CAROL: You're very strange people. 
616,SUSAN: Are we? 
617,"CAROL: Well, you've come from nowhere and you seem to be going nowhere."
618,
619,BARBARA: We're very dependant on the Doctor. He leads and we follow. 
620,CAROL: Travel without a purpose? 
621,"BARBARA: Oh, no, there's a purpose in it. He's trying to get us back to"
622,our own time. On Earth. 
623,"CAROL: Oh, I see. "
624,SUSAN: Isn't' it a better thing to travel hopefully than arrive? 
625,CAROL: Anything's better than circling round a planet for ever and
626,being kept alive. Alive. It's been more like a living death. 
627,DOCTOR: (having looked through a notebook) I just don't understand.
628,There must be a clue here somewhere. There must be. 
629,"IAN: Well I don't know, Doctor. Certainly isn't here. "
630,"MAITLAND: I studied it whenever I could, but it didn't look like"
631,anything that would cause much excitement. The Sensphere is just an
632,"ordinary planet with a slightly bigger land mass than usual, but that's"
633,all. 
634,DOCTOR: Yes. That's very interesting. May I? 
635,MAITLAND: Certainly. 
636,DOCTOR: Excuse me. 
637,SUSAN: I know the Sensorites have discovered thought transference. 
638,"BARBARA: Yes. And when John discovered something, he became so excited"
639,that his mind opened up and broadcast it to the Sensorites. And it was
640,something they wanted kept a secret. 
641,DOCTOR: What? What is this? What was it Chesterton said? Rich beyond
642,the dreams of avarice. Yes. Of course. Of course! I know what he found.
643,
644,IAN: What? 
645,"DOCTOR: Molybdenum. It's here, in the graph, but it's all mixed up with"
646,the lines so it doesn't make obvious reading. 
647,IAN: Molybdenum? 
648,DOCTOR: Yes. 
649,MAITLAND: It resists very high temperatures. 
650,DOCTOR: Yes. It's used as an alloy in steel. In fact this machine would
651,be useless without it. Now let me see. Iron melts at one thousand five
652,"hundred and thirty nine degrees centigrade, and molybdenum melts at two"
653,"thousand six hundred and twenty two degrees centigrade. So, you know,"
654,"we've some idea. Yes, I see now just what John found. I wonder if he"
655,"was excited. Yes, that planet must be full of it. Full of it! It's a"
656,veritable gold mine! 
657,(Maitland and Carol clutch their heads) 
658,MAITLAND: Sensorites! 
659,CAROL: They're here. On the ship. 
660,"IAN: Come on, Barbara. Let's find them. "
661, [Corridor] 
662," (They go quietly past where John is sleeping,"
663,"through a room into another corridor, then up to a door) "
664,BARBARA: Where do you suppose this leads? 
665,IAN: I don't know. Let's find out. Needn't come if you don't want to. 
666,BARBARA: Nonsense. 
667,"(Ian waves his hand in front of the electric eye, the door opens) "
668, [Room] 
669, (The Sensorites step out in front of them. Ian
670,grabs a metal tool from a cupboard) 
671,IAN: Open the door. 
672,(Barbara does so and they back out again) 
673, [Corridor] 
674, IAN: Go and find Maitland. Ask him how to lock
675,these doors. 
676,BARBARA: But Ian. 
677,IAN: Go on. Don't worry about me. Go on. 
678,"(The door opens and the Sensorites step out. Ian keeps backing away,"
679,into another room) 
680, [Control room] 
681," BARBARA: Just tell me, how do we lock the doors?"
682,"Please, try and concentrate. "
683,DOCTOR: The sick member of the crew. Try him. 
684,BARBARA: He'll be in no condition to help. 
685,DOCTOR: Do as I say. 
686, [John's room] 
687, BARBARA: John. Show me how to lock the doors. The
688,Sensorites are on the ship. We must stop them. 
689, [Corridor] 
690, (She helps him out into the corridor as Ian is
691,backing into it. Ian raises his weapon) 
692,"BARBARA: Ian, no. "
693,IAN: Why not? How else can I keep these creatures off? 
694,"BARBARA: Well, do you need to keep them off? Have they actually"
695,"attacked you? Come on, John. Lock the door. "
696,(John waves his hand in front of a lower electric eye) 
697,JOHN: They can't open now. 
698,BARBARA: It's strange they didn't harm you. 
699,JOHN: No. 
700,IAN: I think they were as frightened of me as I was of them. 
701,"BARBARA: They're not very aggressive, are they. "
702,IAN: No. 
703,"BARBARA: Come on, let's get back to the others. "
704,IAN: The others! The other way! The Sensorites can get through that
705,way! 
706, [Control room] 
707, MAITLAND: It's beginning to clear now. 
708,(Ian dashes through to the other hatchway and waves at the electric
709,eye) 
710,"BARBARA: Bolt the door, John. Bolt it. "
711,IAN: Now we'll see what the Sensorites can do. 
712,"(What they can do is hold a device to the electric eye, and the door"
713,just swings open again. But they decide not to open the main hatch
714,door) 
715,"DOCTOR: This is all very well, but I think we should try and contact"
716,them. 
717,BARBARA: Are you two feeling better now? 
718,MAITLAND: Much better. 
719,"CAROL: Oh, I don't know what happened, but I'm certainly feeling better"
720,now. 
721,(The Sensorites are using their communications devices. Susan twitches
722,and jumps) 
723,IAN: I'm sure it's no coincidence that the Sensorites attacked you as
724,soon as you discovered molybdenum. 
725,"SUSAN: Yes, but they won't agree to that. "
726,"DOCTOR: Agree? To what? What are you talking about, child? "
727,SUSAN: I'm sure they'll talk to you about it. 
728,"BARBARA: Susan, what is it? "
729,"SUSAN: All right, I'll ask them. I'll tell you later. The Sensorites"
730,want to know if it's all right for them to talk to you. 
731,IAN: Are you saying that you're in 
732,DOCTOR: Are you saying you've made contact with them? 
733,SUSAN: Yes. 
734,"DOCTOR: Well of course we shall see them, but they must agree not to"
735,harm us. 
736,SUSAN: Right. 
737,DOCTOR: If they try to harm us then I shall fight them. 
738,"(Susan silently relays the message, then opens the main hatch door. The"
739,Sensorites step in) 
740,SENSORITE 1: Which one is the Doctor? 
741,SENSORITE 2: The one with the white hair. 
742,DOCTOR: Speak up. I can't hear you. 
743,SENSORITE 1: We have been speaking to each other. 
744,DOCTOR: What is it you want of us? Why don't you let these space people
745,"go back to their Earth, hmm? "
746,SENSORITE 2: None of you can ever again leave the area of the
747,Sensphere. 
748,IAN: Why not? 
749,SENSORITE 1: You know the answer to that. 
750,IAN: Because of molybdenum. We are not interested in it. 
751,"SENSORITE 2: So you say, but once before we trusted Earth men, to our"
752,cost. 
753,DOCTOR: So Earth men have visited the Sensphere. 
754,"SENSORITE 1: Yes, and they caused us a fearful affliction. We shall not"
755,allow it to happen again. 
756,MAITLAND: What do you expect us to do? Drift around for ever? 
757,"SENSORITE 1: No, you must all come back with us. A special area has"
758,"been prepared for you on the Sensphere. There you will live, and there"
759,you will be looked after. 
760,DOCTOR: These people cannot possibly accede to your request. It's out
761,of the question. 
762,SENSORITE 2: You will do exactly as we tell you because you have no
763,choice. None of you. 
764,"DOCTOR: My party does have a choice, and I assure you we have no"
765,intention of spending the rest of our lives with you. 
766,"IAN: Well, you have our answer. What do you propose to do? "
767,"SENSORITE 1: We intend taking you down to the Sensphere, but we do not"
768,wish to harm you in any way. 
769,"IAN: Since we've met you, we have no wish to harm you either, but you"
770,must get off this ship. 
771,SENSORITE 1: What if we refuse? 
772,IAN: We will attack you. 
773,SENSORITE 1: The other Earth people will not be able to help you. 
774,BARBARA: Surely we've proved that we don't need help. 
775,SENSORITE 2: You have only proved that you can lock doors. We can
776,unlock them. 
777,"DOCTOR: Now listen to me, both of you. You've taken the lock of my ship"
778,and I want it returned immediately. 
779,SENSORITE 1: You're in no position to threaten us. 
780,DOCTOR: I don't make threats. But I do keep promises. And I promise you
781,I shall cause you more trouble than you bargained for if you don't
782,return my property! 
783,SENSORITE 2: We must decide what we shall do. 
784,(The Sensorites leave) 
785,"BARBARA: What do they mean, decide? "
786,IAN: I don't know. Sounds as though there's something else they can do
787,to us. 
788,DOCTOR: So they might have been referring to Susan. 
789,SUSAN: The Sensorites only spoke to me through my 
790,"DOCTOR: Next time, if there is a next time, they might try and control"
791,"your mind, my child. Like they've done to these two people. "
792,"MAITLAND: Doctor, is there no way you can get into your own ship? "
793,"DOCTOR: No, not unless they return what they stole from my ship. "
794,CAROL: But they'll never give it back to you. 
795,"DOCTOR: Oh, my dear, they're not invincible. Oh, no, no, no. Did any of"
796,you notice the peculiarity in their eyes? 
797,"MAITLAND: No, I can't say I did. "
798,"DOCTOR: It's a fallacy, of course, that cats can see in the dark. They"
799,"can't. But they can see better than we humans, because the iris of"
800,their eyes dilates at night. Yes. 
801,"IAN: What are you driving at, Doctor? "
802,"DOCTOR: Oh, it's all perfectly simple, Chesterton. You see, the"
803,Sensorites eyes are the exact opposite to that of a cat. The Sensorites
804,"eyes were completely dilated, that is, enormous, in light. "
805,IAN: The conclusion being that they would contract in darkness. 
806,DOCTOR: Exactly. And that is our best weapon. The Sensorites will be
807,frightened of the dark. 
808,SUSAN: You can't be sure of that. You're only sure they can't see in
809,the dark. 
810,"DOCTOR: I very much doubt, my child, whether they can see in the"
811,semi-darkness. 
812,"BARBARA: But Doctor, assuming you're right "
813,"IAN: Which he is, of course."
814,DOCTOR: Naturally. 
815,"BARBARA: Well, how can you be sure that the Sensorites will be"
816,frightened of the dark? 
817,"DOCTOR: My dear Barbara, wouldn't you be afraid if you couldn't see"
818,"your enemies, hmm? Thank you for your admiration, dear boy. Thank you. "
819,IAN: I never said a word. 
820,"DOCTOR: Telepathy. You know, telepathy isn't only a prerequisite of the"
821,Sensorites. I know sometimes what you're thinking. 
822,SUSAN: Don't want to go. 
823,DOCTOR: My dear. What? 
824,BARBARA: They're talking to her again. 
825,IAN: What are they saying? 
826,"SUSAN: Shh. I can't hear them very well. Oh, that's better. There's"
827,just one voice a long way away. 
828,"DOCTOR: Well, what's the message, child? "
829,"SUSAN: Oh. Oh, all right. But none of the others must be harmed. Don't"
830,"move, any of you. Grandfather, it was the only way. They knew I'd"
831,agree. 
832,DOCTOR: Agree? To what? 
833,"SUSAN: To go down with them to their planet, otherwise we'll all be"
834,killed. 
835,(and the Sensorites close the hatch door behind them) 
836, Episode Three - Hidden
837,Danger 
838, BARBARA: Susan mustn't go with them. 
839,DOCTOR: There can't be air outside the spaceship. 
840,MAITLAND: You can't stop them. 
841,DOCTOR: We must! 
842,"IAN: Come with me, Barbara. "
843,CAROL: Don't. They'll only harm her or kill her if you try and
844,interfere. 
845,"IAN: And if we do nothing, she'll die. "
846,BARBARA: Do you intend to try out the Doctor's theory that they can't
847,see in the dark? 
848,IAN: Why not? It's all we have. 
849, [Corridor] 
850, SENSORITE 1: Go back. 
851,"SUSAN: Don't interfere, please. "
852,SENSORITE 1: The young girl has agreed to go with us. She will not be
853,harmed. Why do you follow us now? 
854,BARBARA: She must not go with you. 
855,"SENSORITE 2: They are not carrying any weapons, yet I am frightened of"
856,them. 
857,SENSORITE 1: Do not come any nearer. 
858,IAN: We want to talk to you. 
859,SENSORITE 2: We have no wish to harm you in any way. 
860,"IAN: I said talk, not fight. "
861,"SENSORITE 2: Intruders from other planets always say they wish to talk,"
862,but all they mean to do is destroy. 
863,"SUSAN: Ian, please let me go with them. Because I can use telepathy,"
864,they trust me. 
865,"BARBARA: You're not going with them, Susan, and that's final. "
866,SUSAN: Why? It's suspicion that's making them enemies. You don't
867,understand the Sensorites. 
868,DOCTOR: Do you think I don't understand? Trust is a two-sided affair. 
869,SUSAN: You're putting us all in danger. 
870,"DOCTOR: If you go with them, then they will have all the advantage. "
871,SUSAN: But they only want to talk to me. 
872,"DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Susan, but I don't believe you have the ability to"
873,represent us. That's all. 
874,SUSAN: Stop treating me like a child. 
875,"DOCTOR: You will do as you're told, Susan. Come here. "
876,"SUSAN: I'm sorry, Grandfather, I can't do it. "
877,DOCTOR: This instant! 
878,(Susan steps forward) 
879,SENSORITE 1: We must stun them with the hand rays. 
880,"DOCTOR: Now, Chesterton. "
881,"(Ian switches the lights off, and in the twilight the Sensorites drop"
882,their weapons and flail about) 
883,"IAN: You were absolutely right, Doctor. They're helpless in the dark. "
884,(Ian picks up the weapons) 
885,"DOCTOR: Susan, go and join Carol. Wait there. I want to talk to you. "
886,SENSORITE 2: Give us back the light. 
887,"SENSORITE 1: The light, the light. I'm afraid. Afraid. Please, help us."
888,
889,"DOCTOR: Put on the light, Chesterton. You could have been left here in"
890,"the darkness. We have power over you, but we don't intend to use it."
891,Only in our defence. 
892,SENSORITE 1: What do you want? 
893,DOCTOR: Nothing that isn't ours. 
894,IAN: You stole the lock from our ship. You also threatened to take us
895,prisoner. 
896,SENSORITE 1: We must ask for new orders. 
897,DOCTOR: What's that? Speak up! 
898,SENSORITE 1: I must refer this matter to the Sensphere. 
899,DOCTOR: Well? 
900,SENSORITE 2: You must be patient. 
901,"DOCTOR: Oh, I won't put up with this nonsense. If they try anything,"
902,put the light out again. 
903,"IAN: All right, I will. "
904,DOCTOR: Dictated to by petty thieves and my own grandchild! 
905,"IAN: I wonder what that thing is that they put up to their foreheads,"
906,"Barbara. Do you think if we did it, we could read each other's minds?"
907,"Hey, Barbara. "
908,"BARBARA: Sorry, I was thinking. You know, I've never seen the Doctor so"
909,angry. 
910,"IAN: Oh, yes. Susan set him off, didn't she. The Sensorites must have"
911,hypnotised her in some way. 
912,"BARBARA: No, I don't think so. She's just growing up, Ian. "
913, [Control room] 
914," DOCTOR: What is all this, setting yourself against"
915,"me, hmm? "
916,"SUSAN: I didn't, Grandfather. "
917,"DOCTOR: Oh, I know you thought you were doing your best, child, in the"
918,"circumstances, but I think I'm a better judge of that. "
919,"SUSAN: Well, I have opinions too. "
920,"DOCTOR: My dear girl, the one purpose in growing old is to accumulate"
921,"knowledge and wisdom, and to help other people. "
922,SUSAN: So I'm to be treated like a silly little child. 
923,"DOCTOR: If you behave like one, yes. "
924,"SUSAN: Oh, look, Grandfather. I understand the Sensorites. They're"
925,timid little people. Because their minds and mine can communicate
926,"sometimes, they trust me. "
927,"DOCTOR: Yes, and I assure you we shall make good use of that fact, but"
928,not without discussions. You will not make decisions on your own
929,"accord. Now, do you understand? Is that quite clear? Well, is it? "
930,"SUSAN: Look, I'm not saying I'm as clever as you, of course I'm not."
931,"But I won't be pushed aside. I'm not a child anymore, Grandfather. I'm"
932,not. 
933,"DOCTOR: Oh, Susan, Susan. "
934,SENSORITE 1: Why do you make her unhappy? 
935,SENSORITE 2: We can read the misery in her mind. 
936,"DOCTOR: Yes, and it's a good thing you can't read the anger in mine. In"
937,"all the years my granddaughter and I have been travelling, we have"
938,never had an argument. And now you have caused one. 
939,"SUSAN: All right, Grandfather, I'll do as you tell me. "
940,"DOCTOR: Good, good. Now let's work together and see if we can't get the"
941,"lock of the Tardis back, hmm? "
942,SENSORITE 1: We have orders from the First Elder. 
943,IAN: Is he your ruler? 
944,SENSORITE 2: Yes. 
945,SENSORITE 1: He says we are to listen to you and to transmit your words
946,to him. 
947,"DOCTOR: Very well, I'd like to talk to him, face to face. I want to"
948,arrange the release of this spaceship. Tell him we're not pirates or
949,plunderers. There's only one treasure we desire from him. 
950,SENSORITE 1: What is that? 
951,DOCTOR: Freedom. 
952, [John's room] 
953, (Carol is stroking his hair when he suddenly sits
954,up) 
955,"CAROL: Oh, it's all right, John. I'm here. "
956,JOHN: The voices. I can hear them. 
957,CAROL: I know. 
958,JOHN: In here. The voices. Afraid. Begging me. 
959,"CAROL: John. John, do you know who I am? "
960,"JOHN: You're good. The Sensorites, they want me to forget. All the"
961,voices begging me and imploring me to forget. 
962,CAROL: John's just woken up. 
963,"MAITLAND: You look much better, John. Much better. We'll soon have you"
964,as good as new. 
965,JOHN: I don't like the voices. I want to have silence in my head. 
966,"MAITLAND: You're going to be all right, John. Try not to upset"
967,yourself. 
968,JOHN: No. Silence. Silence. 
969,"CAROL: It's no use, is it. He might as well be dead. "
970,"MAITLAND: That's foolish, Carol. "
971,"CAROL: Oh, is it? Look at him. Listen to him. Can you imagine what it's"
972,"like being in love with someone, to look at them, to see them and know"
973,they've been destroyed. 
974,MAITLAND: You're going down to the Sensphere with John and some of the
975,others. They're going to cure him. 
976,"CAROL: Oh, it's no use. It's too late. "
977,JOHN: You're good. 
978, [Control room] 
979, BARBARA: And you can do something for John?
980,Really? 
981,"SENSORITE 1: Yes, in time. "
982,"IAN: And that's the whole point, isn't it. How long? You're asking"
983,Barbara and Maitland to stay on the spaceship while we go down to the
984,Sensphere. 
985,SENSORITE 1: We cannot trust you without some safeguard. 
986,IAN: But you're asking us to trust you. 
987,SENSORITE 1: We shall prove trust by curing the man called John. 
988,IAN: Well I don't like this splitting up. 
989,"BARBARA: Well, I don't mind, Ian. "
990,IAN: Well I do. It always leads to trouble. 
991,SENSORITE 1: We cannot agree to any other arrangement. 
992,BARBARA: Then we accept. 
993,"IAN: Oh, very well then. And how do we get down to this Sensphere?"
994,There's no air outside the ship. 
995,SENSORITE 1: A craft will be made available to you. 
996,"DOCTOR: Before we make this journey, one or two questions. "
997,SENSORITE 1: There's time. The craft has not arrived yet. 
998,DOCTOR: These discs you wear round your neck. You press them to your
999,"forehead and you speak or hear through your mind, hmm? "
1000,SENSORITE 1: Yes. 
1001,"DOCTOR: Otherwise, you communicate as we do. "
1002,SENSORITE 1: Yes. 
1003,"DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Quite remarkable. Then you use telepathy to blanket"
1004,"out the minds of the spaceship's crew, hmm? "
1005,"SUSAN: Gently, Grandfather. Don't antagonise them. "
1006,DOCTOR: I merely want to know why you attacked Maitland and the others.
1007,
1008,"SENSORITE 1: Ten years ago, five human beings landed on the Sensphere."
1009,"Our planet welcomed them. Their minds were closed against us, although"
1010,we sensed they thought our planet was a rich one. 
1011,"DOCTOR: Yes, rich in minerals, yes, quite. Go on. "
1012,SENSORITE 1: Then the five men quarrelled. Two of the humans took off
1013,in a ship. It exploded a mile in the atmosphere. 
1014,BARBARA: What happened to the other three men? 
1015,"SENSORITE 1: We imagine they hid themselves aboard, then fought the"
1016,"other two for control. Anyway, all were killed. "
1017,"IAN: Yes, but that still doesn't explain why you attacked Maitland and"
1018,the others. 
1019,"SENSORITE 1: Ever since that day of the explosion in the sky, our"
1020,people have been dying in greater numbers every year. 
1021,"DOCTOR: Yes, some kind of disease I imagine, Chesterton. "
1022,IAN: Maybe. 
1023,BARBARA: Could be as simple as scarlet fever. 
1024,SUSAN: And yet you're allowing us to visit your planet? 
1025,"SENSORITE 1: Our people are dying, and the First Elder says he senses"
1026,great knowledge in you. 
1027,"DOCTOR: Ah ha! I thought so. Yes, yes, yes, some kind of bargaining"
1028,ahead of us. 
1029,SENSORITE 2: The craft is approaching. 
1030,"IAN: Well I suppose it's worth it, Doctor, if we get the lock of the"
1031,Tardis back. 
1032,"DOCTOR: Yes, provided we can produce our side of the bargain. That's"
1033,"the whole point of the issue. Well, my dear. Reluctant as I am to leave"
1034,"you, I'm afraid we have no alternative. "
1035,"BARBARA: Oh, I shall be all right. I'm more worried about you. "
1036,"DOCTOR: Oh, I shall manage. Come along my boy. Susan. "
1037,"IAN: Sorry about this, Barbara. "
1038,BARBARA: I keep telling you I shall be all right. 
1039,IAN: All right. 
1040,BARBARA: Susan. 
1041,SUSAN: Yes? 
1042,"BARBARA: Look, I know how you feel, but your grandfather loves you. "
1043,"SUSAN: Yes, I know. "
1044,"BARBARA: Be patient. We're all on your side really, you know. "
1045,DOCTOR: Susan. We can't do without you. Can we? 
1046,"IAN: Well, we're all ready now. "
1047,SENSORITE 1: I will stay on this ship. You must proceed to the
1048,Sensphere. The First Elder awaits you. 
1049, [Palace of the Elders - Reception room]
1050,
1051, (Three Sensorites are present. The First Elder has
1052,"crossed sashes, the Second Elder a single sash, and the City"
1053,Administrator a dark collar) 
1054,1ST ELDER: But I have already made my decision. 
1055,2ND ELDER: The deaths of our people will increase. 
1056,1ST ELDER: You cannot prove that. 
1057,2ND ELDER: The deaths began at the time of the last visit of human
1058,beings. Why should we welcomed to our planet the same creatures who
1059,have been the means of our destruction. 
1060,"1ST ELDER: I am the ruler of this planet, am I not? "
1061,2ND ELDER: Of course. 
1062,1ST ELDER: Then what is the point of a ruler if he's not allowed to
1063,rule? I have decided to invite these humans because I hope to use them
1064,to end the deaths of our own people. 
1065,2ND ELDER: But how? 
1066,1ST ELDER: I will explain. Sometimes one must use fire to make fire. 
1067,2ND ELDER: The First Elder makes a wise decision. In one degree I
1068,"confess I am anxious. These creatures, these Earth people, are loud and"
1069,ugly things. Why could we not have met them in the desert or in the
1070,mountains? 
1071,1ST ELDER: It is a failure of all beings that they judge through their
1072,"own eyes. To them, we may appear to be ugly. What we must create"
1073,between us is trust. That is why I have invited them to my palace. 
1074,2ND ELDER: But are we sure these Earth creatures are beings as you say?
1075,"There are animals in the deserts and mountains, but we do not invite"
1076,them in to our palaces. Perhaps these Earth creatures are animals too? 
1077,1ST ELDER: Do not underestimate them. Do we possess a spaceship that
1078,"can cross the barriers of the universe? And this small mechanism, which"
1079,"my men brought to me, looks like an ordinary lock but in point of fact"
1080,is an electronic miracle which reveals a mind of science far beyond
1081,ours. And this new arrival known as the Doctor. His mind was quick to
1082,"realise our weakness in the dark and use it against us, but, I would"
1083,"remind you, not unfairly. Merely to protect the girl called Susan."
1084,"Well, and what does our city administrator say? "
1085,"ADMINISTRATOR: Sir, you were elected to lead our people because of your"
1086,great brain. I would not dare to question your actions. 
1087,1ST ELDER: No opinion can be worse sometimes than a very dogmatic one. 
1088,(The First Elder leaves) 
1089,2ND ELDER: You need not fear me. You may speak your mind. 
1090,"ADMINISTRATOR: I am cautious. You are his second opinion, yet he makes"
1091,his decisions without you. 
1092,2ND ELDER: He makes a wise decision. 
1093,ADMINISTRATOR: Based entirely upon trust. Do you trust these Earth
1094,creatures? No more do I. 
1095,2ND ELDER: The decision of the First Elder cannot be set aside. 
1096,ADMINISTRATOR: I would not suggest such a thing. His mind is pure. We
1097,are realists. That is why I have beamed the disintegrator to this room.
1098,
1099,2ND ELDER: Without permission? You are presumptuous. 
1100,ADMINISTRATOR: I am the city's administrator. It is my duty to protect
1101,the one who rules. Can you say that these Earth creatures will not use
1102,force? I am only guarding the First Elder. One suspicious act and the
1103,disintegrator will destroy them. 
1104,2ND ELDER: Very well. But you will do nothing further until I have
1105,considered the matter. 
1106,(leaves) 
1107,ADMINISTRATOR: I shall not wait. We will not be safe until these Earth
1108,creatures are dead. 
1109, [Courtyard] 
1110," (Strolling through the city, past a fountain) "
1111,DOCTOR: I'm glad to have left those silent people. 
1112,SENSORITE 2: Earth people are not popular. 
1113,IAN: Because your people have been dying? 
1114,SENSORITE 2: Yes. 
1115,"DOCTOR: It must be explained to them. The disease, if that's what it"
1116,"is, isn't anybody's fault. Besides, there's cures and preventives. "
1117,SENSORITE 2: You mentioned explaining to the people. You must not speak
1118,to them. You are forbidden to talk to the lower caste. 
1119,SUSAN: Lower caste? Do you have such distinctions? 
1120,SENSORITE 2: Yes. How else can we tell what each man is best fitted to
1121,"do? The Elders think and rule, the Warriors fight, the Sensorites work"
1122,and play. 
1123,DOCTOR: You make it sound so very simple. 
1124,SENSORITE 2: And all are happy. 
1125,"IAN: But some are happier than others, eh? "
1126,SENSORITE 2: I do not understand. There is no disgrace in being in any
1127,of the castes. It is simply what one is best fitted for. 
1128,JOHN: They're near us now. 
1129,"CAROL: It's all right, John. I'm here. "
1130,JOHN: The evil minds. 
1131,SUSAN: He knows something. 
1132,"CAROL: Oh, it's just a jumble of words. "
1133,"SUSAN: No, Carol, no. Remember, his mind is open. He can tell the"
1134,difference between good and evil people. He's trying to tell us
1135,something. 
1136,CAROL: Come on. Come on. Come on. 
1137, [Disintegrator control] 
1138, ADMINISTRATOR: Is everything prepared? 
1139,ENGINEER: I must test the impulse circuits. Ready to receive power. 
1140,ADMINISTRATOR: Here is the firing key. Beam the disintegrator to the
1141,reception room at the Palace of the Elders. 
1142,ENGINEER: Ready. 
1143,ADMINISTRATOR: Three places have been assigned to the Earth creatures.
1144,Horizontal lines four 
1145,ENGINEER: Four. 
1146,ADMINISTRATOR: Seven and nine. 
1147,ENGINEER: Nine. The vertical positions? 
1148,ADMINISTRATOR: X A two. 
1149,ENGINEER: X A two. 
1150,ADMINISTRATOR: X B three. 
1151,ENGINEER: X B three. And the last? 
1152,ADMINISTRATOR: X C four. 
1153,ENGINEER: X C four. What part of the body do you want the beam to
1154,strike? 
1155,"ADMINISTRATOR: In each case, to the heart. "
1156,ENGINEER: Are the hearts of the human creatures on the right or left
1157,"side of their bodies, or in the centre as in ours? "
1158,ADMINISTRATOR: I do not know. 
1159,ENGINEER: Then I will aim the beam at the centre of the chest in each
1160,case. 
1161,ADMINISTRATOR: And that will prove fatal? 
1162,"ENGINEER: Yes. Two, eight, seven. The disintegrator is beamed and"
1163,ready. They are just entering the corridor to the reception room now.
1164,Impulses working correctly. They are just entering the reception room.
1165,This switch here turns on the beam. 
1166,"ADMINISTRATOR: How can you judge their movements so correctly,"
1167,Engineer? 
1168,ENGINEER: The palace is defended with electrothermal couples. We trace
1169,their movements by the heat of their bodies. 
1170,ADMINISTRATOR: And you can tell exactly when they move into their
1171,places in the reception room? 
1172,ENGINEER: With absolute accuracy. 
1173,"ADMINISTRATOR: Then when they are seated, kill them. "
1174, [Reception room] 
1175," 1ST ELDER: Very well, I agree. "
1176,SUSAN: You can do it? 
1177,"1ST ELDER: Yes. The man John can be exactly as he used to be, but it"
1178,will take time. Conduct him to one of the rest rooms. Say that my
1179,orders are that he must be treated. 
1180,"CAROL: I must go with him, because he needs me. "
1181,1ST ELDER: Very well. You will be given a room near him. 
1182,"CAROL: Thank you. Come on, John. "
1183,JOHN: Good. He is a good man. Not like. 
1184,"DOCTOR: Not like who, John? "
1185,JOHN: He is good. 
1186,(Carol and John leave) 
1187,IAN: Thank you for being so understanding. 
1188,DOCTOR: It doesn't alter the fact that you're responsible for his
1189,condition. I think it's utterly disgraceful. 
1190,"1ST ELDER: Please, do not condemn before you know the facts. "
1191,"DOCTOR: Facts? What facts, sir? "
1192,"SUSAN: Grandfather, please don't. "
1193,DOCTOR: Very well. 
1194,1ST ELDER: Please sit at the places set for you. 
1195, [Disintegrator control] 
1196, ENGINEER: They are just taking their positions. 
1197,ADMINISTRATOR: Get ready to fire. 
1198,2ND ELDER: Stop! Disconnect the disintegrator. 
1199,ADMINISTRATOR: Why? 
1200,"2ND ELDER: Because they are reasonable, they are civilised. "
1201,"ADMINISTRATOR: They are Earth creatures, and dangerous to us. "
1202,"2ND ELDER: I tell you, they're talking with the First Elder, and in a"
1203,most friendly fashion. We need not fear them. 
1204,ADMINISTRATOR: Not whilst we have the disintegrator. It is beamed to
1205,their positions. They can be destroyed in a second. 
1206,2ND ELDER: But they will not be. Dismantle the machine. 
1207,"ADMINISTRATOR: I say that the trust that we give to each other, we"
1208,cannot show to these Earth creatures. 
1209,2ND ELDER: And I order that the machine be dismantled. Give me the
1210,firing key. 
1211,(The Engineer hands it over) 
1212,"2ND ELDER: I am doubtful about you. You question orders, you question"
1213,authority. Take care lest my doubts are become realities. 
1214, [Reception room] 
1215," (The Doctor, Ian and Susan are being served"
1216,refreshments) 
1217,"1ST ELDER: If foreigners visited your planet with intention to steal,"
1218,what would you do? Would you imprison them? Would you kill them? The
1219,man John was like the other humans who came here. He became so excited
1220,when he found that our planet contained a valuable ore that his mind
1221,just opened up and shouted out the secret to us. 
1222,DOCTOR: Molybdenum. 
1223,1ST ELDER: That is correct. He thought of a fleet of spaceships to come
1224,here and mine the metal and transport it back to his own planet. We saw
1225,"the pictures he formed in his mind, and we saw that it was the end of"
1226,our way of life. We had no alternative but to imprison him and his
1227,friends in orbit round the Sensphere. 
1228,"IAN: Yes, but that's no reason for driving him out of his mind. "
1229,"1ST ELDER: Happened only, I assure you, because of his excitement. His"
1230,"mind had no reserve, no defence. We caused the others to sleep, but he"
1231,heard the full power of our voices in his brain. Stop. Do not drink.
1232,Why do you offer insult to our guests? Why do you not give them the
1233,same food and drink that I am given? Who ordered this? The city
1234,Administrator? 
1235,(The serving Sensorite nods) 
1236,1ST ELDER: You will bring them the crystal water and take the other
1237,away. 
1238,"IAN: Tell me, what exactly is the difference? "
1239,"1ST ELDER: In the yellow mountains that surround this city, I"
1240,discovered a pure spring. Very unusual in this planet. I believe the
1241,"water holds special qualities, so I have flagons of it stored for the"
1242,use of the Elders. 
1243,IAN: And this one? 
1244,1ST ELDER: Is very well refined. We are very proud of our aqueduct. It
1245,lies beneath the city. 
1246,IAN: I hope you won't be offended if I drink some. I'm very thirsty.
1247,(drinks) 
1248,1ST ELDER: As long as you taste of the crystal water. It is very fine.
1249,None of the Elders drink anything else. 
1250,DOCTOR: Vintage water. 
1251,SUSAN: This fruit is delicious. It tastes like peaches. 
1252,(The water is exchanged) 
1253,"DOCTOR: Now, sir, let us talk of the future. Our future. "
1254, [Disintegrator control] 
1255, ADMINISTRATOR: We are being bound hand and foot
1256,and given to these people from Earth. Our leaders are grown weak. 
1257,"ENGINEER: I will follow you, the city Administrator. Command me. "
1258,ADMINISTRATOR: I thank you for your loyalty. You shall have my
1259,confidence. 
1260,ENGINEER: I gladly accept. I do not trust these Earth creatures. 
1261,ADMINISTRATOR: The First and Second Elders are deceived. I question
1262,"their leadership. If they do not change their attitude, they may have"
1263,to give way to one of stronger thought and action. 
1264,ENGINEER: Command me. 
1265,"ADMINISTRATOR: For the moment, I am glad of your loyalty. The time for"
1266,action will not be far away. 
1267, [Reception room] 
1268, SUSAN: So you are the senior Elder? 
1269,"1ST ELDER: Signified by the twin sash I wear. The Second Elder, my"
1270,"advisor, wears one sash. Other important professions wear distinctive"
1271,markings. 
1272,DOCTOR: And the ordinary people? 
1273,1ST ELDER: Are contented with their similarity. 
1274,IAN: Would you mind telling us something about the (sudden coughing
1275,fit) I beg your pardon. The disease. 
1276,"SUSAN: Yes, would you tell us about it. We might be able to help you. "
1277,1ST ELDER: I intended to. We need help with this calamity. The disease
1278,"is invisible, and resists all our attempts to stamp it out. It hits all"
1279,"manner of people, irrespective of their tasks. "
1280,DOCTOR: Yes. Does it affect the Elders? 
1281,1ST ELDER: No. 
1282,DOCTOR: I wonder why not? 
1283,1ST ELDER: I cannot imagine. We have been fortunate? 
1284,(Ian coughs again) 
1285,"DOCTOR: Yes, it, er, might be a clue. But what I hope, sir, was this"
1286,"er, that if my friends and I succeed where your scientists failed, will"
1287,you return the lock of my ship? 
1288,SUSAN: It would be a just return. 
1289,1ST ELDER: Your granddaughter speaks well. 
1290,"DOCTOR: Yes, she's a fine young woman. My dear Chesterton, are you all"
1291,right? 
1292,"IAN: My throat, burning. I wonder if you could give me a glass of"
1293,"water, Doctor. "
1294,DOCTOR: Is this a symptom of your disease? 
1295,(Ian collapses) 
1296,"SUSAN: Ian! Grandfather, he's unconscious. "
1297,1ST ELDER: There is no hope. Your friend is dying. 
1298, Episode Four - A Race
1299,Against Death 
1300, [Reception room] 
1301, (Ian is lying face down on the floor) 
1302,DOCTOR: Why has it happened to him and not to us? 
1303,SUSAN: Can you do anything for him? 
1304,"1ST ELDER: The disease hits all manner of people. Suddenly, without"
1305,warning. 
1306,DOCTOR: Never the Elders? 
1307,1ST ELDER: No. 
1308,DOCTOR: It's incredible. The build-up in body temperature. This
1309,"disease, as you call it, is it contagious? "
1310,1ST ELDER: No. 
1311,DOCTOR: I wonder. Is it a germ in the air? 
1312,"SUSAN: Grandfather, it doesn't seem like a disease at all. "
1313,DOCTOR: I agree with you. 
1314,SUSAN: We've done everything together. We've come from the spaceship
1315,"together, we've come through the city together. "
1316,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes. "
1317,SUSAN: This room. The fruit. 
1318,"DOCTOR: No. No, no, no, no, no. You had some of it. "
1319,"SUSAN: Oh, yes. "
1320,DOCTOR: I know. He drank a different kind of water. It's the water! 
1321,1ST ELDER: Then why do not all who drink the aqueduct water die? 
1322,"DOCTOR: Well, it depends on their resistance. In time, of course, all"
1323,will succumb. 
1324,1ST ELDER: You cannot be sure of this. 
1325,"DOCTOR: No, I can't. This is all we have to go on. Send for your"
1326,"servant, please. "
1327,"SUSAN: His eyes are opening, Grandfather. "
1328,IAN: (very hoarse) Susan. 
1329,"DOCTOR: It's all right, Chesterton. Rest quietly. This isn't a disease,"
1330,it's more like poison. 
1331,(The servant arrives and bows) 
1332,"DOCTOR: Oh, go to your scientists now. I want some sodium chloride and"
1333,I want it quickly. 
1334,IAN: What happened to me? 
1335,"SUSAN: Hush, Ian. Just rest. "
1336,1ST ELDER: Do you wish your companion to stay here? 
1337,"DOCTOR: Please, please. "
1338,1ST ELDER: Bring some covers. 
1339,"DOCTOR: Now, sir, your indulgence. "
1340,1ST ELDER: I am distressed by this tragedy. What can I do to be of
1341,assistance? 
1342,"DOCTOR: Well, we must make sure no one drinks anything but the crystal"
1343,water. 
1344,1ST ELDER: Agreed. 
1345,DOCTOR: Fine. And can I work with your scientists? 
1346,1ST ELDER: They will be honoured. 
1347,"DOCTOR: Splendid, splendid. "
1348,SUSAN: How long has he got? 
1349,1ST ELDER: I hear the distress in your mind. I respond to it. I wish I
1350,could be more reassuring. 
1351,SUSAN: How long? 
1352,"1ST ELDER: From the first symptoms, no one has lived longer than the"
1353,third day. 
1354,DOCTOR: As long as that? Then we have time. I have chemicals and
1355,"equipment on my ship. Return the lock and I promise you, sir, I will"
1356,not only cure my young friend but all your people. 
1357,(The servant returns) 
1358,"DOCTOR: Ah, good. "
1359,1ST ELDER: I must discuss this matter with the Second Elder. 
1360,"DOCTOR: Well do not delay any longer than is necessary, please. Thank"
1361,"you. Now, salt and water, Susan. An old-fashioned remedy but I'm sure"
1362,"it'll serve. Thank you. Now, my boy. "
1363,"SUSAN: Ian. Ian, try and sit up. "
1364,"DOCTOR: Come along, old chap. "
1365,"IAN: Feeling very weak, Doctor. "
1366,"DOCTOR: Yes, now I want you to drink all of this. It isn't going to be"
1367,"pleasant, but it's all for your own good. "
1368,IAN: Drink. 
1369,DOCTOR: That's it. 
1370,"(Ian drinks, splutters at the saltiness) "
1371,DOCTOR: Will they let me into my ship? 
1372, [Courtyard] 
1373, 2ND ELDER: Now be guided by me in this matter. The
1374,one they call the Doctor may not be sincere. 
1375,1ST ELDER: But his friend is dying. 
1376,2ND ELDER: Or pretending to die. Then you let the Doctor into his
1377,spaceship. 
1378,1ST ELDER: Would he leave his friends at our mercy? 
1379,"2ND ELDER: But who knows what power he has in the ship? Once inside it,"
1380,we may be at his mercy. 
1381,"1ST ELDER: Well, I believe in him. "
1382,2ND ELDER: The Doctor may go away to fetch an army of human beings and
1383,a fleet of spaceships. 
1384,1ST ELDER: This is a terrible picture you paint. Do you mistrust them
1385,as much as all that? 
1386,"2ND ELDER: I do not trust them as much as you, so I advise caution. "
1387,"1ST ELDER: I will think of your advice, and weigh up the matter. "
1388, [Laboratory] 
1389," (John is in a chair, with a metal crown of"
1390,electrodes on his head) 
1391,SCIENTIST: How may I help the city Administrator? 
1392,ADMINISTRATOR: Why is this creature here? 
1393,SCIENTIST: We are clearing his mind. 
1394,ADMINISTRATOR: On whose orders? 
1395,SCIENTIST: The First Elder. 
1396,"ADMINISTRATOR: It would have been better to kill him than cure him,"
1397,Scientist. 
1398,2ND ELDER: Leave us. 
1399,(The scientist leaves) 
1400,2ND ELDER: Once again you question the voice of authority. 
1401,"ADMINISTRATOR: Sir, the Elders rule this planet while I am only"
1402,"responsible for this city, yet I will do everything within my power to"
1403,protect and defend that city. 
1404,2ND ELDER: Be careful your power is not taken from you. 
1405,ADMINISTRATOR: These intruders threaten us all. This creature is being
1406,cured! 
1407,"2ND ELDER: Yes, we fulfil a promise. "
1408,ADMINISTRATOR: At any moment you will put them in their ship and let
1409,them go! This is madness! 
1410,2ND ELDER: One more insolent word from you and I shall ask that your
1411,collar of office be taken from you. This man is to be cured. As for the
1412,other one. 
1413,ADMINISTRATOR: Which other one? 
1414,2ND ELDER: The one known as Ian Chesterton. 
1415,ADMINISTRATOR: These are absurd names they all have. None of them wear
1416,any signs of authority or badges of position. How are we to distinguish
1417,them? What is wrong with the other one? 
1418,"2ND ELDER: He has caught the disease. Their commander, the Doctor,"
1419,believes our water supply is to blame. 
1420,"ADMINISTRATOR: What a brilliant scheme. Evil, but undoubtedly"
1421,brilliant. 
1422,2ND ELDER: Explain. 
1423,ADMINISTRATOR: To attack our confidence in one of the necessities.
1424,There is nothing wrong with our water supply. Nothing at all. This is a
1425,trick to get us at their mercy.
1426,JOHN: Evil. Evil. 
1427,ADMINISTRATOR: Do you see? Even this half-broken creature here admits
1428,the truth. 
1429,2ND ELDER: I must warn the First Elder. 
1430,(Second Elder leaves) 
1431,"JOHN: No, no. Evil is here. "
1432,ADMINISTRATOR: He cannot hear you. Your mind is closed by the machine.
1433,Your voice is not believed. 
1434,JOHN: You are my enemy. 
1435,"ADMINISTRATOR: I am the enemy of all Earth creatures, and any Sensorite"
1436,who defends them shall be swept away. 
1437,JOHN: I must warn them of your evil. I must. I must! 
1438,(John passes out) 
1439,ADMINISTRATOR: Your brain is too weak to harm me. 
1440,"CAROL: How's John? Oh, I am sorry. I thought you were one of the"
1441,scientists. 
1442,ADMINISTRATOR: You can see my collar of office. I am the city
1443,Administrator. 
1444,"CAROL: Yes, I'm sorry, but when your backs are turned, it's very"
1445,difficult to see. I don't know what we'd all do if you changed your
1446,badges and sashes. We wouldn't be able to tell you apart. 
1447,ADMINISTRATOR: I have never thought of that. 
1448,CAROL: John? 
1449, [Reception room] 
1450, (The Doctor's anger is making the First Elder
1451,cringe. Ian is on a sheepskin covered couch nearby) 
1452,DOCTOR: But he'll die! 
1453,1ST ELDER: No noise! I beg of you. 
1454,SUSAN: Why can't you make up your mind? 
1455,DOCTOR: Just look at that young man. I've done all I can for him at the
1456,moment. Given him salt and water. He's been coughing his heart out. I
1457,"must have chemicals and equipment. His death will be your fault, and"
1458,yours alone. 
1459,"1ST ELDER: Very well, I "
1460,2ND ELDER: Sir. 
1461,(They commune telepathically) 
1462,DOCTOR: What is it now? 
1463,SUSAN: I can't hear very clearly. Their minds aren't open to me. 
1464,"DOCTOR: Do you really mean you can hear their minds talking, Susan? "
1465,"SUSAN: Yes, but it's not very distinct. "
1466,"1ST ELDER: Doctor, I cannot allow you to go to your ship. "
1467,DOCTOR: Don't set yourself against me. 
1468,1ST ELDER: There is a laboratory here. You may prove your poisoned
1469,"water theory there, or not at all. "
1470,DOCTOR: You fool! 
1471,(The Sensorites cringe) 
1472,"SUSAN: Grandfather, please! They think you're attacking them. We're"
1473,sorry. There's so much about your planet we don't understand. 
1474,DOCTOR: It's inhuman. 
1475,SUSAN: Grandfather. 
1476,DOCTOR: Just monstrous. 
1477,SUSAN: We didn't mean to use sound as a weapon. We didn't even know
1478,sound hurt you. 
1479,"1ST ELDER> Very well, but please be careful in future. I wish to"
1480,see regular reports on the progress of this theory. 
1481,"(The First Elder leaves, Second Elder stays) "
1482,DOCTOR: Theory? 
1483,"SUSAN: Grandfather, please! "
1484,"DOCTOR: I know we have no alternative, but such outrageous behaviour!"
1485,"Oh, forget it, child. Now, I want you to stay here and act as nurse."
1486,"Watch his pulse rate, will you, and let me know immediately "
1487,IAN: Doctor. What's happened to me? 
1488,DOCTOR: How are you feeling? 
1489,IAN: My throat's still sore. 
1490,DOCTOR: Any pains elsewhere? 
1491,"IAN: No, but I feel very giddy. "
1492,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, you just rest there quietly. Yes, we'll let him have"
1493,"all the crystal water he wants, and if his breathing gets febrile,"
1494,"artificial respiration. Now, sir. Your laboratory. And I only hope"
1495,there's time to save him. 
1496, [Courtyard] 
1497, ENGINEER: The Second Elder has given the firing
1498,pin to the Chief of Warriors. I saw him. 
1499,ADMINISTRATOR: Then the disintegrator is no longer of any use to us.
1500,How can we destroy these crea 
1501,(First Elder enters) 
1502,ENGINEER: Shh. 
1503,1ST ELDER: I have placed our laboratory at the disposal of the man
1504,called the Doctor. See to it that he is given every cooperation. 
1505,"ADMINISTRATOR: Yes, sir. "
1506,(First Elder leaves) 
1507,ADMINISTRATOR: Your witness. These creatures are defeating us with
1508,smiles and gentle words. Our leaders listen and agree. Soon we shall
1509,all be slaves. 
1510,ENGINEER: What can we do? 
1511,ADMINISTRATOR: Bring the Second Elder to me. Alone. The girl Carol gave
1512,me an idea. How would you recognise the Second Elder at a distance? 
1513,ENGINEER: By the sash he wears. 
1514,ADMINISTRATOR: Bring the Second Elder to me at the disintegrator room. 
1515,ENGINEER: Yes. 
1516,ADMINISTRATOR: We must match cunning with cunning. 
1517, [Laboratory] 
1518," (Lots of twirly glass and rubber hoses on a table,"
1519,and John safely out of sight over on the right of our screen) 
1520,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I have to say, very comprehensive. Now, gentlemen,"
1521,time is not on our side. I believe your people have been dying because
1522,"there is atropine poison in the aqueduct water. Now, allow me. I've"
1523,made a few notes here which might interest you. Now these are the
1524,symptoms. Atropine causes dilation of the blood vessels. Temperature
1525,rises and pulse rate becomes very rapid. A rash may appear. The mouth
1526,"and throat both become extremely dry. Now what we have to do is this,"
1527,gentlemen. Isolate the poison and then prescribe the remedy. 
1528,SCIENTIST 2: We give you our assistance. 
1529,DOCTOR: Good. 
1530,SCIENTIST: Although we have tested the water already. 
1531,"DOCTOR: Yes, well then we must try again. "
1532,SCIENTIST: Over here is a sample of the aqueduct water. 
1533,"DOCTOR: Ah, yes. You know, a strange thing here is, not all your people"
1534,died. 
1535,SCIENTIST 2: Three in every ten. Last year it was two in every ten. 
1536,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course some may be able to resist it or perhaps some of"
1537,the water is good. 
1538,SCIENTIST: But all the water is the same. 
1539,"DOCTOR: Yes, but surely from different outlets? "
1540,"SCIENTIST 2: There are ten districts in the city, but only one source. "
1541,"DOCTOR: Well, gentlemen, there's a poison at work here. I know the"
1542,signs. Now what you must do is to test samples from each and every
1543,district. Where did that come from? 
1544,SCIENTIST 2: This palace. It is district ten. 
1545,"DOCTOR: I see. Well now, I suggest that you sample that bottle, and"
1546,mark it and then start keeping records. And there's not a moment to
1547,"lose. And remember, I want samples from all the outlying districts."
1548,It's imperative. 
1549,"(And so the testing starts, as Ian becomes delirious. District after"
1550,"district comes back negative for contaminants, until - ) "
1551,"DOCTOR: This one! I've found it. And just as I suspected, atropine"
1552,poison. That's why your people have been dying off. 
1553,SCIENTIST: But why were some of the districts negative? 
1554,"DOCTOR: Because it varies from place to place, and when you made your"
1555,"tests, you didn't discover it. "
1556, [Reception room] 
1557, 1ST ELDER: And can the Doctor discover a cure? 
1558,2ND ELDER: He says so. Caffeine citrate is the antidote. 
1559,1ST ELDER: Remarkable man. Remarkable. 
1560,"2ND ELDER: I have an appointment, then I shall return to the"
1561,laboratory. 
1562,1ST ELDER: Give my Doctor the congratulations on the progress. 
1563,"(Second Elder leaves, and First Elder goes over to Ian's sickbed or"
1564,couch) 
1565,SUSAN: He's much easier now. 
1566,1ST ELDER: The Doctor has had some success. A remedy will be available
1567,soon. 
1568,"SUSAN: Thank goodness. Ian. Ian, you're going to be all right. "
1569, [Disintegrator room] 
1570, ADMINISTRATOR: They are coming now. 
1571,(Second Elder enters) 
1572,2ND ELDER: Why are we meeting here? 
1573,ADMINISTRATOR: Hold him! 
1574,(Two Sensorites grab the Second Elder) 
1575,2ND ELDER: You will be punished for this offence. 
1576,ADMINISTRATOR: I advise you to answer my questions. Your family group
1577,is also in my power. 
1578,2ND ELDER: What have you done with them? 
1579,ADMINISTRATOR: Nothing so far. Has the Doctor completed his
1580,experiments? 
1581,2ND ELDER: Yes. 
1582,ADMINISTRATOR: And the antidote is to be given to the young man Ian? 
1583,2ND ELDER: Yes. 
1584,ADMINISTRATOR: And then to our people who are also ill? 
1585,2ND ELDER: Yes. 
1586,ADMINISTRATOR: I do not believe there is an antidote. The young man
1587,"pretends to be ill. The Doctor pretends to cure him, and then he will"
1588,kill us all with the poison he has made. 
1589,2ND ELDER: That's not true! Our scientists have worked with him. They
1590,say 
1591,ADMINISTRATOR: Silence! You are a traitor to our people. You are not
1592,worthy to wear this. 
1593,"(He pulls off the Elder's sash, and his own collar, then puts the sash"
1594,on himself) 
1595,2ND ELDER: What are you going to do? 
1596,ADMINISTRATOR: This so-called antidote must be stopped. The people will
1597,obey their Elders. 
1598,2ND ELDER: The First Elder has approved the antidote. 
1599,ADMINISTRATOR: And yet it will be stopped. The Second Elder will
1600,suppress it. 
1601,2ND ELDER: I will not! 
1602,ADMINISTRATOR: I wear your sash of office. Who is to know that I am not
1603,the Second Elder now? Bind him. Keep him here. 
1604, [Laboratory] 
1605," CAROL: You're tired out, Doctor. "
1606,"DOCTOR: Yes, but a happy tiredness, my dear. How's our friend? "
1607,"CAROL: Oh, he's improving, but he still seems to go back sometimes to"
1608,that old state of confusion. 
1609,"DOCTOR: Yes, you must expect that. Ah, my friend. You've prepared the"
1610,antidote? 
1611,"SCIENTIST: Yes, Doctor. "
1612,DOCTOR: Splendid. Now I think we ought to start making this in large
1613,quantities. Will you please see that that goes to the First Elder's
1614,"room? Give it to my granddaughter, Susan. "
1615,SCIENTIST: I'll send a messenger immediately. 
1616,"DOCTOR: Yes, well now we shall soon be off this planet. "
1617,CAROL: When John's cured. There's no quick antidote for him. 
1618,"DOCTOR: Oh, courage, my dear. Courage. Of course, I'm rather baffled"
1619,"with this atropine poison, because it only seems to appear in one part"
1620,of the city or rather one reservoir at a time. It's curious. 
1621,"CAROL: Yes, but you've discovered an antidote now. "
1622,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, that's a cure all right, but then why cure something"
1623,"when we can stamp it out, hmm? "
1624,JOHN: Enemies. 
1625,"DOCTOR: What's that, my friend? "
1626,JOHN: Plotting. 
1627,"CAROL: He's more coherent now, but it's as if he was living in a dream"
1628,world where he's surrounded by enemies. 
1629,JOHN: Enemies. Yes. Making plots. 
1630,"DOCTOR: I don't know. He might be more lucid, you know, than one should"
1631,"imagine. Now I'm going off on an expedition, and I want you to take"
1632,note of what he says. 
1633,JOHN: Listen to John. 
1634,"DOCTOR: You see, he knows his name. Now you stay with him. I think he's"
1635,"getting better, and I'm sure you're going to have a great future"
1636,"between you, later on. Now, after my little exploration..."
1637,"CAROL: Where are you going, Doctor? "
1638,"DOCTOR: I'm going to find the First Elder, Scientist, rather, and we're"
1639,"going off on an exploration. It isn't dangerous, of course. But when I"
1640,have solved my problem I'm sure we shall all be out of trouble. 
1641, [Courtyard] 
1642, ENGINEER: Supposing your disguise is seen through?
1643,
1644,ADMINISTRATOR: You must remember that the First and Second Elders are
1645,well known only to those in powerful positions. The people see them
1646,"rarely, and mostly at a distance. "
1647,SCIENTIST: I greet the Second Elder. 
1648,"ADMINISTRATOR: I return your greeting, Scientist. "
1649,(The Scientist starts to leave) 
1650,ENGINEER: Success! 
1651,"ADMINISTRATOR: Yes. Scientist, come here. Where are you going? "
1652,"SCIENTIST: The man from the spaceship, the Doctor, has found a cure."
1653,Poison was in our water supply. Here is the antidote. 
1654,ADMINISTRATOR: You take it to the young Earth creature who is ill? 
1655,SCIENTIST: Yes. 
1656,ADMINISTRATOR: Give it to me. I will deliver it. Return to your
1657,laboratory. 
1658,(The Scientist leaves) 
1659,ENGINEER: If this Doctor has found a cure 
1660,ADMINISTRATOR: It's a trick. They are trying to poison us all. I will
1661,prove it to you. They say without the antidote the young man will die.
1662,I say he will live because he is pretending. 
1663,"(And he throws the vial to the floor, where it smashes) "
1664,ADMINISTRATOR: This will prove it one way or the other. 
1665, [Reception room] 
1666, SUSAN: Why hasn't the antidote arrived yet? 
1667,1ST ELDER: I do not know. 
1668,"IAN: Doctor must have run into a snag, Susan. It's not always possible"
1669,to do these things at the snap of a finger. 
1670,SUSAN: I'm going to find out why. May I do that? 
1671,1ST ELDER: Yes. I will have you conducted to the laboratory. Go with
1672,"this servant, and give my respects to the senior scientist. "
1673, [Aqueduct] 
1674, SCIENTIST: Here is the entrance to the aqueduct. 
1675,DOCTOR: It's very gloomy. 
1676,SCIENTIST: All our attempts to light it end in failure for one reason
1677,or another. 
1678,DOCTOR: But that must make it rather difficult for you. The Sensorites
1679,"dislike darkness, don't they? "
1680,SCIENTIST: We avoid this place. We have no reason to go down to the
1681,aqueduct anyway. 
1682,"DOCTOR: Well, it may be because you've neglected it that the water's"
1683,become poisoned. 
1684,SCIENTIST: Shall we return now? 
1685,DOCTOR: Return? I don't want to return. I haven't just come here for a
1686,look. I'm going in there. 
1687,SCIENTIST: No! You must not. 
1688,DOCTOR: And why? 
1689,SCIENTIST: You will not be able to see. 
1690,"DOCTOR: Oh, but I have a torch. "
1691,SCIENTIST: There are monsters in there. 
1692,DOCTOR: Indeed? Are there? 
1693,"SCIENTIST: Yes, we've heard them. "
1694,DOCTOR: And not seen them? 
1695,"SCIENTIST: No, but they are there. The noise is terrifying. "
1696,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think you should return to the laboratory. I shall be"
1697,"all right. Leave it to me, will you? I assure you. "
1698,(The Scientist leaves) 
1699,DOCTOR: How very convenient. Yes. Noise and darkness. The two things
1700,the Sensorites dislike. There's more in this than meets the eye. 
1701, [Reception room] 
1702, (Susan has given Ian an injection) 
1703,1ST ELDER: I cannot understand why the Second Elder did not bring the
1704,antidote here. 
1705,SUSAN: Well I managed to get some more. That's all that really matters.
1706,"Thank you. Now, no running around for a bit, Ian. "
1707,"IAN: Yes, Matron. Actually, I'm quite happy to stay here. I feel as"
1708,though someone has given me a good going over with a hammer. 
1709,(The Scientist enters) 
1710,"SCIENTIST: I attend you, sire. "
1711,1ST ELDER: My orders have not been complied with. I asked for regular
1712,reports. Where have you been? 
1713,"SCIENTIST: Forgive me, sir. The Doctor asked me to take him to the"
1714,aqueduct. 
1715,1ST ELDER: Why? 
1716,SCIENTIST: He said that that was where the root of the trouble lay. I
1717,couldn't stop him. He sent me away and said he was going in. 
1718,1ST ELDER: Did you not warn him? 
1719,"SCIENTIST: Yes, but he took no notice. "
1720,SUSAN: Warn him of what? 
1721,1ST ELDER: The aqueduct. It's inhabited by monsters. 
1722,IAN: What? Why did you let him go down there? 
1723,SCIENTIST: I couldn't stop him. 
1724,IAN: We must get him out. Haven't you got someone you can send down
1725,there to help him? 
1726,1ST ELDER: The caverns are dark. We are helpless. 
1727,SUSAN: Take some light with you then. 
1728,1ST ELDER: Other expeditions have tried and failed. Most of our men do
1729,"not return, and those that do speak of terrible things. "
1730,"IAN: Well, I'll have to go myself and "
1731,SUSAN: No you won't. 
1732,"IAN: We can't stay here, Susan. "
1733,"SUSAN: You're too ill, Ian. "
1734,IAN: I'm not that ill. 
1735,SUSAN: All right. We'll need someone to show us the way. 
1736,1ST ELDER: I beg you to change your minds. You cannot save your friend.
1737,
1738,"IAN: We'll never know till we try, will we? "
1739,"(The Scientist leads them out, Ian leaning on Susan) "
1740,1ST ELDER: These people have fine qualities. The Second Elder and I
1741,"have misjudged them, and I will tell him so. "
1742,(He uses his telepathy device) 
1743, [Disintegrator room] 
1744," 2ND ELDER: I hear you, sir. I hear you. "
1745,ADMINISTRATOR: Someone's mind is in communication with yours? Whose is
1746,it? The First Elder? 
1747,2ND ELDER: Give me the mind transmitter. 
1748,"ADMINISTRATOR: Do you think I'm a fool? You can hear, but you cannot"
1749,speak your mind without this. What is he saying to you? 
1750,2ND ELDER: I refuse to tell you. 
1751,ADMINISTRATOR: Think of your family group. Its safety depends upon you.
1752,
1753,2ND ELDER: It is the First Elder. He says we have misjudged the human
1754,beings from Earth. He's saying the one called the Doctor has gone down
1755,"into the viaduct, that the young man and the girl called Susan have"
1756,gone to rescue him. He is asking why I don't reply. 
1757,"ADMINISTRATOR: No one, no one can come out of the aqueduct alive. The"
1758,one known as the Doctor is near death. The other two approach death. I
1759,see victory for all my plans! 
1760, [Aqueduct] 
1761, IAN: Is this it? 
1762,SCIENTIST: Yes. Take this. It's a radio-electric light. 
1763,"SUSAN: Thank you. Ian, how do you feel? If you don't want to go any"
1764,"further, just say. "
1765,"IAN: No, I'm fine. Come on. "
1766, [Cavern] 
1767, (The Doctor has found something) 
1768,DOCTOR: Is it? Yes. I thought so. Atropa Belladonna. Deadly Nightshade.

1773, [Cavern] 
1774," SUSAN: What is it, Ian? "
1775,IAN: We must find him. 
1776,SUSAN: Are you all right? 
1777,IAN: Yes. 
1778,SUSAN: Lean on me. 
1779,DOCTOR : Keep away! 
1780,SUSAN: Grandfather! 
1781,"IAN: He's unconscious. Here, help me to get him out of here. "
1782,SUSAN: Look at the state he's in. 
1783,(The back of the Doctor's jacket is in shreds) 
1784,IAN: Don't worry about that. Collect up his things. We don't want to
1785,hang around here. It's going away. 
1786,"SUSAN: Ian, what do you think this is? "
1787,IAN: I don't know. Part of an old lighting system I suppose. Don't
1788,worry about that now. Let's get him out of here before that thing comes
1789,back. 
1790, [Laboratory] 
1791, CAROL: Can't just give up. You know the aqueduct.
1792,Surely you can help them in some way? 
1793,SCIENTIST: I regret it is impossible. 
1794,1ST ELDER: You have no conception of what extreme sound does to us. It
1795,stuns the brain and paralyses the nerves. 
1796,SCIENTIST: And in the darkness we're helpless anyway. Our warriors will
1797,be more of a hindrance than a help. 
1798,"CAROL: Is there no hope for them, then? "
1799,"1ST ELDER: Let us speak of your companion, the man John. The senior"
1800,scientist told me that he's making excellent progress. The final
1801,treatment will be given today. 
1802,CAROL: Thank you. 
1803,1ST ELDER: You are sad for the friends you have lost. Rejoice for the
1804,"friend who is being returned to you. Scientist, you will report to me"
1805,on your progress. 
1806,"SCIENTIST: I will, sir. "
1807,CAROL: Those poor people. 
1808, [Aqueduct] 
1809, SUSAN: Just look at this coat. It's ruined. 
1810,IAN: Those look like claw marks. Strange they didn't reach your skin. 
1811,"DOCTOR: Yes, strange indeed when you realise that I was at the mercy of"
1812,that creature. It was so dark in there it was invisible and it knocked
1813,me to the ground. 
1814,IAN: Are you sure you didn't see it? 
1815,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. Something hit me under the heart and it was most"
1816,unpleasant. It was a good thing I sent you that antidote. Otherwise I
1817,might have been in a much worse state than I was.  
1818,SUSAN: We didn't get the antidote. I had to go all the way back to the laboratory
1819,and get some more. 
1820,DOCTOR: What? 
1821,IAN: Yes. Surrounded by enemies. 
1822,"DOCTOR: Then it's true. True. The water, and those monsters in there,"
1823,and now it appears that there's someone among the Sensorites that bear
1824,us ill-will. That's two separate enemies. 
1825,IAN: Don't you mean three? 
1826,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. No, don't mistake me. The water and those"
1827,monsters are distinctly connected. I've more or less solved that
1828,problem. But this Sensorite who's against us is a much greater danger.
1829,Now I suggest we go back and try and find out which one it is. 
1830,IAN: Yes. 
1831,(A Sensorite watches them leave) 
1832, [Laboratory] 
1833, JOHN: Treachery. 
1834,CAROL: He keeps on saying the same things. 
1835,JOHN: A plot. I must warn you. 
1836,CAROL: I'm sure he's discovered something or he's overheard someone and
1837,he's trying to tell us. 
1838,JOHN: Yes. Tell you. Warn you. 
1839,CAROL: You see? 
1840,SCIENTIST: It must be illusion. Our society is based upon trust.
1841,Treason or secret plotting is impossible. 
1842,CAROL: That's rather a sweeping statement. 
1843,SCIENTIST: But why should a Sensorite make any secret plans against
1844,anyone? We have the perfect society. All are contented. 
1845,CAROL: Some people always want more than others. 
1846,"SCIENTIST: That is a human value, surely. "
1847,"CAROL: Perhaps. Rest quietly now, John. It won't be long. (to"
1848,Scientist) You were trying to explain something to me earlier. 
1849,SCIENTIST: We discovered long ago that in our brains there were many
1850,"different compartments or divisions. When fear or alarm is at work,"
1851,"that section becomes open, a veil is lifted. Do you understand? "
1852,CAROL: Yes. 
1853,SCIENTIST: That is what happened to the man John. But the veil will not
1854,"lower itself. Thus he is constantly afraid. Even when he's at peace,"
1855,"when he's asleep for example, the body says one thing, the brain the"
1856,"other. That's his condition, utter confusion. "
1857,CAROL: And this treatment you're giving him is in order to close down
1858,that veil? 
1859,"SCIENTIST: Yes. Not permanently, of course, or he would step into"
1860,danger without concern. The veil must function normally again. 
1861,"CAROL: It's rather like an eyelid, isn't it. These shutters over my"
1862,eyes. 
1863,"SCIENTIST: Yes. To see all the time is not a good thing. Now, we must"
1864,begin. 
1865,"CAROL: Yes. I'll be here all the time, John. "
1866,JOHN: Carol. 
1867,"CAROL: Yes, that's right. "
1868,"JOHN: I must tell you, but it's so difficult. "
1869,CAROL: Soon you'll be able to tell me all you've found out. 
1870, [Disintegrator room] 
1871," (The Second Elder is being untied, but the"
1872,Administrator still wears his sash of office) 
1873,"ENGINEER: There is no mistake, City Administrator. I saw the Doctor and"
1874,the other two leave the aqueduct. I hear them talking. They are
1875,suspicious. 
1876,ADMINISTRATOR: The creature John is nearly cured. He too can speak
1877,against me. We are nearly surrounded by our enemies. 
1878,2ND ELDER: You will be uncovered as a traitor and a criminal. 
1879,ADMINISTRATOR: Silence. 
1880,ENGINEER: What are we to do? 
1881,ADMINISTRATOR: These Earth creatures are working to destroy the
1882,"Sensorite nation. Their pleasant smile conceals sharp teeth, their soft"
1883,words hide deadly threats. 
1884,"2ND ELDER: Please, don't listen. "
1885,ADMINISTRATOR: And who opposes them? Weak and timid creatures like this
1886,"Second Elder here, whose sash I wear. "
1887,2ND ELDER: Thief. 
1888,ADMINISTRATOR: Whimpering betrayer of our people. Coward! I should
1889,"imprison you in some room wherein no light can shine, and fill that"
1890,room with noise! 
1891,"2ND ELDER: Do it, then. Finish with me. "
1892,"ADMINISTRATOR: Not yet. Remember, I hold your family group. First you"
1893,shall do something for me. Summon the Senior Warrior with your mind
1894,transmitter. Tell him to bring the firing key of the disintegrator and
1895,meet you in the forecourt of the palace. 
1896,2ND ELDER: No. 
1897,ADMINISTRATOR: Remember your family group. 
1898,2ND ELDER: Very well. 
1899,ADMINISTRATOR: I shall be listening. Stand over him. Stab him if he
1900,sends his mind to anyone other than the Senior Warrior. Now send this
1901,"thought. Senior Warrior, this is the Second Elder. Go on! Send it!"
1902,Good. He's answering. Tell him to bring the firing key and meet you in
1903,the courtyard of the Palace of the Elders. That is enough. I shall keep
1904,the appointment you have made. The Senior Warrior shall know me by the
1905,sash I wear. Your sash. Guard him well. 
1906,(The Administrator leaves) 
1907,2ND ELDER: Why do you listen to him? Why do you follow him? 
1908,"ENGINEER: He will not betray our people, nor surrender our planet. "
1909,2ND ELDER: He will bring us all down. All of us. 
1910,ENGINEER: Be silent! 
1911,2ND ELDER: All of us.

1913," DOCTOR: You've been exerting yourself, boy, and"
1914,naturally you're weak.

1916,to. 
1917,IAN: I wish you two'd stop fussing over me. 
1918,"DOCTOR: Now, now, you must do as you're told, and that is that. Isn't"
1919,that one of the Elders? 
1920,SUSAN: It's the Second Elder. He's only got one sash. 
1921,(They see the Warrior hand the key over to the 'Elder') 
1922,"DOCTOR: Take it easy. I want a word with him. I say, you, sir. Sir, I'd"
1923,like a word with you. 
1924,"(The Doctor follows him off, and the Warrior leaves in the opposite"
1925,direction) 
1926,"SUSAN: It's a funny place down here, isn't it? "
1927,IAN: What about up there? I wonder how Barbara's getting on? 
1928,SUSAN: I wish she were down here with us. 
1929,"IAN: I wish we were up there in the Tardis and away from here. Still, I"
1930,"know what you mean. Hey, why don't we ask the First Elder if Barbara"
1931,can come down and join us. 
1932,(The Doctor returns) 
1933,SUSAN: Yes. 
1934,DOCTOR: Most extraordinary. He ran away from me! 
1935,"SUSAN: (laughs) That must have looked funny. Flip, flap, flip, flap. "
1936,"DOCTOR: I can assure you he was very mobile, my child. Come along,"
1937,let's get into the First Elder's room. Come along. 
1938, [Disintegrator room] 
1939, ADMINISTRATOR: Why have you not retied his hands?
1940,"(the Engineer obeys) Now, now I have the power. "
1941,(The Second Elder shrugs off the Engineer and takes the key from the
1942,Administrator. He then bends it against the edge of the console) 
1943,"ADMINISTRATOR: Stop him, you fool! "
1944,"(There's a brief struggle, and the Engineer knocks out the Second"
1945,Elder) 
1946,ADMINISTRATOR: He has broken it! 
1947,ENGINEER: The Second Elder is dead! 
1948,ADMINISTRATOR: The only other firing key is in the possession of the
1949,First Elder! 
1950,"ENGINEER: Then we shall have to give up. We must leave the city, hide"
1951,in the mountains. 
1952,"ADMINISTRATOR: No, no. Don't be foolish. The death of the Second Elder"
1953,"can help us, not condemn us. We must act quickly. You know the man"
1954,called the Doctor? 
1955,ENGINEER: Yes. 
1956,ADMINISTRATOR: You can describe him? 
1957,ENGINEER: Yes. 
1958,ADMINISTRATOR: Good. Then I will outline my plan to you. 
1959, [Reception room] 
1960," 1ST ELDER: Yes, I have asked questions. The first"
1961,"supply of the antidote you sent, Doctor, was intercepted by my Second"
1962,"Elder, my advisor. He has since disappeared. "
1963,SUSAN: We saw him in the courtyard. 
1964,1ST ELDER: His behaviour is a mystery. 
1965,"DOCTOR: Yes, strange indeed, sir. I tried to talk to him and he ran"
1966,away. 
1967,IAN: Yes. You still won't accept that he's done something bad. 
1968,"1ST ELDER: I cannot. I selected him for office, but it is not pride"
1969,which makes me defend my choice. I know that Sensorite. I trust him. 
1970,SUSAN: And yet you can't explain his actions. 
1971,1ST ELDER: A mystery does not mean that he is guilty. 
1972,(A Sensorite enters with a cloak) 
1973,1ST ELDER: For the Doctor. 
1974,DOCTOR: My dear sir. That's most civil of you. I ruined my jacket down
1975,"in the aqueduct, but of course I have others on my ship. Thank you. "
1976,SUSAN: Very smart. 
1977,DOCTOR: Beau Brummell always said I looked better in a cloak. 
1978,"(The Administrator enters, wearing his proper collar) "
1979,1ST ELDER: The City Administrator wishes to speak? 
1980,"ADMINISTRATOR: Urgently, sir. A story has been put before me that you"
1981,should hear. 
1982,1ST ELDER: Now? 
1983,ADMINISTRATOR: It concerns the Second Elder and these Earth creatures. 
1984,1ST ELDER: Very well. 
1985,ADMINISTRATOR: Enter. 
1986,(The Warrior and the Engineer enter) 
1987,ADMINISTRATOR: Tell your story. 
1988,"ENGINEER: Sir, the Second Elder is dead. He was killed in the"
1989,courtyard. I saw the man who killed him. 
1990,1ST ELDER: The man? 
1991,"ENGINEER: Yes, sir. It was the man called the Doctor. "
1992,SUSAN: That's not true! 
1993,ADMINISTRATOR: The Senior Warrior here has evidence. Speak. 
1994,"WARRIOR: I met the Second Elder in the courtyard, as he ordered me to."
1995,I gave him the firing key of the disintegrator. Then I saw the Doctor
1996,go after the Second Elder. 
1997,"DOCTOR: Yes, I did that, but I didn't kill him. "
1998,ENGINEER: I saw you. You wrestled for possession of the firing key. 
1999,"ADMINISTRATOR: There is the firing key, bent as though in a struggle. "
2000,"ENGINEER: And finally, when the Second Elder resisted, you took an"
2001,"object from inside your coat, and struck him down and killed him. "
2002,1ST ELDER: This is a grave charge. 
2003,"IAN: But obviously untrue, sir. "
2004,1ST ELDER: Why? 
2005,IAN: How did you recognise the Doctor? 
2006,ENGINEER: His hair is different. 
2007,IAN: Yes. 
2008,ENGINEER: So are his clothes. 
2009,"IAN: Oh, yes, his clothes. You say that you saw him take an object from"
2010,his pocket. 
2011,ENGINEER: Yes. 
2012,IAN: You could see quite clearly? You're sure it was from his coat
2013,pocket? 
2014,ENGINEER: I tell you yes! All the Sensorites know the Doctor by his 
2015,"(The Doctor stands, and poses grandly in his cloak) "
2016,IAN: The Doctor's coat is outside the aqueduct. You are lying. 
2017,"ENGINEER: Then, then it was a cloak he was wearing! Yes, it was. I'm"
2018,sure of it now. It was a cloak. 
2019,1ST ELDER: I have just presented the Doctor with that cloak. Your story
2020,is a tissue of lies. Remove him. 
2021,ADMINISTRATOR: I shall interview you myself. 
2022,(The Warrior leads the Engineer away) 
2023,"ADMINISTRATOR: Sir, you must forgive his wild accusation, but I felt"
2024,his story should be brought before you. 
2025,1ST ELDER: You acted correctly. What can have possessed my advisor? 
2026,"ADMINISTRATOR: The Second Elder, sir, was always opposed to our"
2027,visitors. Perhaps he stole the firing key in order to attack them with
2028,the disintegrator? 
2029,SUSAN: I bet he stole our antidote too. He was our enemy. 
2030,"1ST ELDER: A sad matter. But since he has deceived us, my sympathy"
2031,shall not be wasted. As to his replacement. 
2032,"ADMINISTRATOR: I have his sash of office here, so that you may select a"
2033,new advisor immediately. 
2034,IAN: Perhaps he ought not to look further than this room.
2035,"SUSAN: Yes. If he thought he got promotion because of us, he'd be a"
2036,useful ally. 
2037,"DOCTOR: Just what I was thinking. Yes, of course, we have no wish to"
2038,"interfere in your affairs, but the City Administrator appears to have"
2039,all the qualifications. 
2040,"1ST ELDER: Well, what do you say? Can you accept such power, such"
2041,authority? 
2042,ADMINISTRATOR: My only ambition is to serve the Sensorite nation. 
2043,1ST ELDER: Then accept this sash. I make you my advisor. From now on
2044,"you will be know as the Second Elder, second only on the Sensphere to"
2045,"me. And once this order is made, only a betrayal of trust can set it"
2046,aside. 
2047,"(The Administrator takes of his neck band, and the First Elder puts the"
2048,sash on him. But I'll still call him Administrator) 
2049,1ST ELDER: My new advisor and I have much to discuss. You will excuse
2050,us? 
2051,"DOCTOR: Certainly, sir. My companions and I will pay a visit to the man"
2052,"John, and note his progress. "
2053,"SUSAN: Oh, you were going to ask about Barbara. "
2054,IAN: I don't think this is quite the moment. I'll ask later. 
2055,SUSAN: All right. 
2056,"IAN: Oh, and congratulations. "

2071,JOHN: What have I been like all this time? 
2072,CAROL: Don't you remember? 
2073,"JOHN: Some things, but most of it seems a sort of grey cloud. I just"
2074,remember that it seems a very long time. 
2075,"CAROL: Yes. Oh, John, I can't tell you how I feel. How glad. "
2076,SCIENTIST: It is indeed a time of happiness for both of you. 
2077,"CAROL: Oh, this is the scientist who cured you. "
2078,JOHN: Then I have a lot to thank you for. 
2079,(He holds out his hand) 
2080,SCIENTIST: What do you ask for? 
2081,"JOHN: We have a custom of shaking hands with someone, in friendship. "
2082,"SCIENTIST: Then, I accept. "
2083,"(The Doctor, Ian and Susan enter) "
2084,"DOCTOR: Well, well. What a happy scene. "
2085,SUSAN: Do you remember us? 
2086,JOHN: I remember you distinctly. 
2087,"IAN: Well I'm Ian, and this is the Doctor, Susan's grandfather. "
2088,DOCTOR: I'm glad to see you don't bear a grudge against the Sensorites
2089,for the past. 
2090,CAROL: All that matters now is the present. 
2091,"DOCTOR: Splendid. Now sir, the antidote. I wonder if "
2092,(They move off out of shot) 
2093,JOHN: I remember another girl. 
2094,"SUSAN: Oh, that's Barbara. We both found you. She's up in the"
2095,spaceship. 
2096,JOHN: Oh I see. 
2097,"SUSAN: John, all the time you were ill, you were trying to warn us of"
2098,something. 
2099,JOHN: There was a Sensorite who was dangerous. I must try and remember
2100,what happened. 
2101,(The Administrator sneaks in quietly) 
2102,"JOHN: I know there was a plot. Yes, that's it. Someone was plotting"
2103,against you 
2104,ADMINISTRATOR: And this Sensorite. Can you identify him? 
2105,JOHN: No. 
2106,ADMINISTRATOR: Is he in this room? 
2107,"JOHN: No. There was something particularly odd about his clothes, I"
2108,remember. Exactly what 
2109,"ADMINISTRATOR: Yes, it must have been the Sensorite who just died. "
2110,SUSAN: Yes. I suppose it must. 
2111,ADMINISTRATOR: The First Elder wishes to talk to the Doctor. You will
2112,inform him. 
2113,SUSAN: All right. 
2114,(The Administrator leaves) 
2115,JOHN: He's not very friendly. 
2116,"SUSAN: Well, he's only just become Second Elder. I should think he's"
2117,trying out his new authority. 
2118,CAROL: I wouldn't like to cross him. 
2119,(Across the lab) 
2120,DOCTOR: And what is this little collection of things here? 
2121,SCIENTIST: Left behind by the humans that were killed in the spaceship
2122,explosion. 
2123,DOCTOR: I see. 
2124,"IAN: Oh, look at these, Doctor. Family snapshots. Look. "
2125,"DOCTOR: Yes, now just a moment. This is rather important. This is a"
2126,rough plan of the aqueduct. 
2127,SCIENTIST: One of the human beings was very interested in the aqueduct.
2128,
2129,DOCTOR: Is that so? 
2130,"SUSAN: Grandfather, the First Elder wants to talk to you. "
2131,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. I have a couple of questions for him. "
2132,SCIENTIST: This is only a sketch. I can let you have a plan in detail
2133,if you need. 
2134,"DOCTOR: Very valuable, very valuable. "
2135,SCIENTIST: The City Administrator can have no objection. 
2136,SUSAN: The City Administrator! Of course! 
2137,DOCTOR: What about him? What about him? 
2138,"SUSAN: John, you know you said that there was something odd about the"
2139,Sensorite? Was it his collar? 
2140,"JOHN: Collar. Yes, that was it. "
2141,"SUSAN: You see, the City Administrator. He was our enemy. "
2142,"IAN: What, the one who's just been made the Second Elder? "
2143,"SUSAN: Yes! When John was ill, he must have given himself away. "
2144,IAN: Yes. He was certainly pretty odd with me. 
2145,"DOCTOR: If this is true what you say, Susan, there's trouble ahead for"
2146,us. That Sensorite has power now. 
2147,"IAN: Yes, and the worst of it is, we gave him the power. "
2148, [Disintegrator room] 
2149, ADMINISTRATOR: You were not to know that the
2150,Doctor had changed his coat. I managed your escape from prison and that
2151,is all that matters. 
2152,"ENGINEER: I am grateful, but what use am I now? "
2153,ADMINISTRATOR: I still have a task for you. You are accomplished in
2154,mechanical matters. 
2155,ENGINEER: Yes. What do you want me to do?  
2156,ADMINISTRATOR: (holding weapons) Can you remove the mechanisms but
2157,leave them looking perfect from the outside? 
2158,ENGINEER: Yes. 
2159,ADMINISTRATOR: Then see to it. 
2160, [Reception room] 
2161, IAN: It's no use telling him stories about the
2162,"Second Elder, Doctor. We've got to give him proof. "
2163,"DOCTOR: Yes, I quite agree. And the only way to get that proof is to go"
2164,back into the aqueduct. What about Susan? 
2165,"IAN: Look, why don't you ask the First Elder if we can have Barbara"
2166,down here again. 
2167,DOCTOR: A good idea. 
2168,1ST ELDER: Gentlemen. Be seated. 
2169,"DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. "
2170,"IAN: Well, sir, the Doctor and I have discussed this poison business,"
2171,and we are convinced that your water supply is being deliberately
2172,poisoned. 
2173,"DOCTOR: Yes, and what we propose to do, sir, is to go down into the"
2174,"aqueduct, find your enemies and stop them. "
2175,"1ST ELDER: Very well. But you will take light with you, and such arms"
2176,as we can provide. 
2177,DOCTOR: Thank you. We're making progress. 
2178,IAN: Barbara. 
2179,"DOCTOR: I wonder, sir, could I ask you a small favour? "
2180,1ST ELDER: Ask it. 
2181,"DOCTOR: We have a companion, a young lady, on the ship. Is it possible"
2182,for her to be brought down here in the Sensphere? 
2183,1ST ELDER: It will be arranged. 
2184,"DOCTOR: Splendid, sir. Splendid. "
2185,"WARRIOR: I have brought the weapons, sir. "
2186,1ST ELDER: Ah. Thank you. Warrior. Instruct them as to their use. 
2187, [Courtyard] 
2188, ADMINISTRATOR: It's done. I have arranged that the
2189,useless weapons shall be delivered to the humans. Hide yourself. 
2190,(Engineer leaves) 
2191,ADMINISTRATOR: What have you there? 
2192,"SCIENTIST: It is the plan of the aqueduct, sir. The Doctor asked for"
2193,it. 
2194,ADMINISTRATOR: Give it to me. I will deliver it. Return to your duties.
2195,
2196,"SCIENTIST: Thank you, sir. "
2197,(Scientist leaves) 
2198,"ADMINISTRATOR: The plan of the aqueduct. (Engineer reappears) Quickly,"
2199,change some of the routes on this and see that a messenger delivers it
2200,to the Doctor. 
2201,ENGINEER: It shall be done. 
2202,"ADMINISTRATOR: Now, not only shall they go down into the aqueduct with"
2203,"useless armaments, but they will be hopelessly lost as well. "
2204, [Reception room] 
2205, (They are looking at the weapons) 
2206,"IAN: Very simple to use, Doctor. "
2207,DOCTOR: Careful. 
2208,WARRIOR: The range is considerable. The ray paralyses up to a distance
2209,of thirty yards. 
2210,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, splendid. And remember, dear boy, that I shall be"
2211,standing nearly next to you. I've never liked weapons at any time.
2212,"However, they're handy little things. Tell me, how long does this"
2213,paralysis last? 
2214,WARRIOR: One hour. 
2215,"DOCTOR: Fine, fine. These weapons are splendid, sir. And without a"
2216,doubt they'll help us to make success. 
2217,1ST ELDER: And yet I do not envy you your adventure. I still wish I
2218,could dissuade you. 
2219,"DOCTOR: Yes, and that brings me to another problem. My granddaughter,"
2220,Susan. She's bound to want to come with us. 
2221,"IAN: I don't think she ought to, Doctor. "
2222,"DOCTOR: No, I quite agree with you, my boy. We must go and not tell"
2223,"her, and save any arguments. I wonder, sir, would you mind keeping a"
2224,small secret until we're well and truly away? 
2225,1ST ELDER: Very well. 
2226,"DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. After all, there's no danger now we have these"
2227,"protectors, and I'm sure we can settle our little business in an hour"
2228,or two. 
2229,"1ST ELDER: Ah, the map of the aqueduct. "
2230,"DOCTOR: Oh, excellent, excellent, my dear sir. "
2231,"IAN: Well, let's go and make an end of it, Doctor. "
2232,DOCTOR: Are you quite sure you're up to it? 
2233,IAN: Quite. 
2234,DOCTOR: Splendid. Lead the way. Sir. 
2235,(Ian and the Doctor leave) 
2236,"WARRIOR: They are brave people, sir. "
2237,1ST ELDER: We will not regret having known them. 
2238,"WARRIOR: I am glad they were innocent of killing the Second Elder, sir."
2239,
2240,"1ST ELDER: Yes, I am still anxious about that. You realise that if they"
2241,"did not kill my advisor, then he must have been killed by a Sensorite. "
2242,WARRIOR: But who would do such a thing? 
2243,"1ST ELDER: Who, yes, but also I ask myself, why was it done? "
2244, [Laboratory] 
2245, (Food is laid out on low tables) 
2246,JOHN: I've never felt so hungry. 
2247,"CAROL: Oh, won't it be wonderful when we get back to the Earth, John?"
2248,"How I long for a thick, juicy steak. "
2249,"JOHN: Well, you'll just have to make do with a small juicy fruit. "
2250,SUSAN: I wonder where they've gone to? I don't know what they're
2251,talking about all this time. 
2252,"CAROL: Oh, I expect they're arranging for our return to the spaceship. "
2253,(Ian and the Doctor arrive at the aqueduct and go into the tunnel to
2254,the caverns) 
2255,CAROL: I think I'll go over to the Palace of the Elders and try and
2256,hurry them up. 
2257,"SUSAN: Oh, would you, Carol? Thank you. "
2258,JOHN: Tell them I'm starving. 
2259,CAROL: All right. 
2260,(Carol leaves) 
2261,"SUSAN: John, I'm so happy that you're better now. So's Carol. Well, you"
2262,can see that for yourself. 
2263,"JOHN: Hmm. She's had a bad time. You know, I've a feeling that we'll"
2264,both give up space travelling when we get back to Earth. 
2265,"SUSAN: Oh, and get married? "
2266,"JOHN: She's all I really care about. Come on, let's eat. I'm tired of"
2267,waiting. 
2268," (over in the Palace of the Elders Courtyard, Carol"
2269,is grabbed from behind and dragged off.) 
2270, Episode Six - A
2271,Desperate Venture 
2272, [Disintegrator room] 
2273, (Carol is dragged into the room and thrown to the
2274,floor) 
2275,CAROL: Why are you doing this? 
2276,ADMINISTRATOR: Pay attention to me. You write a letter to the man John.
2277,
2278,CAROL: I certainly will not. 
2279,ADMINISTRATOR: Argument is a waste of time. Two of your friends have
2280,gone up into the spaceship. They cannot help you. Two of the others
2281,have gone down into the aqueduct. 
2282,CAROL: The Doctor and Ian? 
2283,"ADMINISTRATOR: Yes. They cannot help you. The other two, the man John"
2284,"and the girl Susan, are waiting innocently in the laboratory for you."
2285,Your party is divided. 
2286,CAROL: What do you want me to do? 
2287,ADMINISTRATOR: Write to the man John. Tell him you have gone up into
2288,"the spaceship. In this way, he will not suspect your disappearance. "
2289,CAROL: You can't force me to do this. 
2290,ADMINISTRATOR: I can see that you stay alive. Your life means nothing
2291,"to me. Let us strike a bargain. You will write the note, I will see you"
2292,live. 
2293,CAROL: Very well. 
2294,ENGINEER: Be wary of her. We cannot read her thoughts. She may 
2295,ADMINISTRATOR: Be quiet. Write! You will stay here and guard her. She
2296,will guarantee the success of all my plans. 
2297,ENGINEER: And I shall be given high office? 
2298,ADMINISTRATOR: I shall reward those who are faithful to me. 
2299,(The note reads - John. Have gone to the spaceship. Carol.) 
2300, [Reception room] 
2301, (The note has been delivered) 
2302,SUSAN: She couldn't have gone up to the spaceship. 
2303,"JOHN: Either you'd have seen her, or passed her on the way. "
2304,SUSAN: Yes. 
2305,BARBARA: She was obviously forced to write this. Whoever made her do it
2306,had no idea that I was being brought down here. 
2307,SUSAN: I bet the City Administrator had something to do with it. 
2308,JOHN: But why kidnap her? 
2309,"BARBARA: I should think the why's fairly obvious, wouldn't you? "
2310,"JOHN: No, I don't think it is, Barbara. We're on good terms with the"
2311,"First Elder, the Doctor's discovered an antidote for the poison and now"
2312,he and Ian are tracking down the cause of the trouble. 
2313,"BARBARA: Look, I've been away in the ship so maybe I can see things"
2314,more clearly. And I think we're being used by one of the Sensorites who
2315,wants to gain power. 
2316,SUSAN: You mean we're not just being attacked because we're from other
2317,planets? 
2318,BARBARA: No. 
2319,1ST ELDER: I greet you. 
2320,"BARBARA: Thank you. Your friends expressed so much concern about you, I"
2321,agreed to have you brought down to the Sensphere. 
2322,BARBARA: I'm afraid we must ask for your help. 
2323,1ST ELDER: If I can. 
2324,BARBARA: The Doctor and Ian are missing. Have you any idea where they
2325,are? Well please tell me. 
2326,1ST ELDER: There is a quality in human beings which intrigues me. Your
2327,concern for each other. I assure you the two men are safe. 
2328,BARBARA: You know where they are? 
2329,"1ST ELDER: Yes, but they asked me not to tell you what their plans"
2330,were. 
2331,SUSAN: That's Grandfather. 
2332,"BARBARA: Look, would you mind reading this letter? "
2333,1ST ELDER: I gave no such order. 
2334,"BARBARA: No, we didn't think you did. "
2335,1ST ELDER: Then why does your friend write what is not true? 
2336,JOHN: Because someone made her write it. 
2337,1ST ELDER: She could not travel without my ordering it. Where did you
2338,receive this? 
2339,"SUSAN: It was given to us in the courtyard, where the arches are. "
2340,JOHN: She is being held prisoner. 
2341,1ST ELDER: Not by any Sensorite. 
2342,JOHN: Of course she is! 
2343,"BARBARA: Quietly, John. "
2344,"SUSAN: Look, whatever she wrote this with wasn't dry. I put my thumb on"
2345,it and smudged it. 
2346,1ST ELDER: And this is her writing? 
2347,ALL: Yes. 
2348,JOHN: And that smudge means that it was written just before we got it. 
2349,1ST ELDER: Are you implying that your friend Carol is being held
2350,prisoner in this palace? I assure you she is not. 
2351,"BARBARA: Well, are there any other buildings in the vicinity? "
2352,"1ST ELDER: None, except the disintegrator room. "
2353,BARBARA: Where's that? 
2354,1ST ELDER: Below the courtyard. It is rarely used now. I cannot unravel
2355,"this mystery, but I can see that it worries you. As to your other"
2356,"friends, I must tell you. They have gone down into the aqueduct. "
2357,SUSAN: What? 
2358,1ST ELDER: They were given light and a good map. Also they were well
2359,armed. They can be in no danger. 
2360, [Cavern] 
2361," IAN: There's no doubt about it, Doctor. The inside"
2362,filament's been removed. These weapons are useless. 
2363,"DOCTOR: It's only one of our troubles, dear boy. Look at this map. It's"
2364,"no good to us. Look, all the lines have been altered. Somebody's been"
2365,jiggering around with it. 
2366,"IAN: We'll get out of here somehow, Doctor. "
2367,"DOCTOR: Yes, in time. But have we got that time? Remember, we brought"
2368,no food with us and the only water available is that poisoned water out
2369,there with Deadly Nightshade. A charming outlook. 
2370, [Disintegrator room] 
2371, CAROL: How long are you going to keep me here? 
2372,ENGINEER: That is not for me to say. 
2373,"CAROL: Look, I've had nothing to eat and I'm very thirsty. "
2374,ENGINEER: It is of no consequence. 
2375,CAROL: But I wrote the letter. 
2376,ENGINEER: But surely you did not think you would be released? All human
2377,creatures are naive. They live while they have a purpose. As soon as
2378,"that purpose is achieved, then their life has no value left. "
2379,"(John tries to sneak in, but is spotted. The Engineer grabs a power"
2380,lead) 
2381,ENGINEER: Stop. I've only to touch her with this and she will die. 
2382,JOHN: Don't be foolish. Put it down. 
2383,ENGINEER: No Sensorite should be humbled before a human creature! 
2384,(Carol pulls at the other end of the cable and the machine sparks and
2385,smokes) 
2386,JOHN: Throw it down. Throw it down! 
2387,(The Senior Warrior enters) 
2388,JOHN: Take him to the First Elder. 
2389,WARRIOR: I have already imprisoned you once. This time you will not
2390,escape. 
2391,"CAROL: Oh, John. "
2392, [Reception room] 
2393, 1ST ELDER: This is very serious. That Sensorite
2394,was imprisoned on my order. Now I find he has escaped and kidnapped one
2395,of the human beings. 
2396,ADMINISTRATOR: He is a menace to our society. 
2397,1ST ELDER: I agree. 
2398,ADMINISTRATOR: Let him be punished. 
2399,1ST ELDER: He shall be. We must also find who his accomplice is. 
2400,ADMINISTRATOR: Ah. So you believe that another Sensorite is working
2401,with him? 
2402,1ST ELDER: Obviously. He had to guard the girl Carol. Who then
2403,delivered the letter she was forced to write? 
2404,(Susan and Barbara enter) 
2405,1ST ELDER: What I cannot tolerate is accusation. I must have clear and
2406,definite proof. 
2407,"ADMINISTRATOR: Yes, sir. Clear and definite proof. "
2408,"1ST ELDER: Come in, my friends. You have been questioning this"
2409,Sensorite who has acted so treacherously? 
2410,"SUSAN: Yes, and what he told us is terrifying. "
2411,ADMINISTRATOR: Has he identified his accomplice? 
2412,BARBARA: No. 
2413,SUSAN: Not yet. 
2414,BARBARA: But he did say that the maps and the guns given to the Doctor
2415,and Ian are quite useless. 
2416,1ST ELDER: Outrageous. This Sensorite will die for this. 
2417,"SUSAN: Yes, but what about Grandfather and Ian? "
2418,1ST ELDER: What can I say? Lost and unarmed in the aqueduct. 
2419,BARBARA: I'm afraid that answer isn't good enough. 
2420,ADMINISTRATOR: Do not be insolent to the First Elder! 
2421,"BARBARA: Look, you must decide who your friends are, and save them. "
2422,1ST ELDER: There is nothing I can do. 
2423,BARBARA: Is there an authentic map to the aqueduct? 
2424,1ST ELDER: Yes. 
2425,"BARBARA: Well, if Susan and I can find a way to rescue them, will you"
2426,help us? 
2427,"ADMINISTRATOR: I am suspicious of these creatures, sir. They ask too"
2428,much. 
2429,"1ST ELDER: That other human being, the Doctor, he found a cure for our"
2430,people. He has placed his life in danger for the sake of the Sensorite
2431,"nation. Yes, I will give you all the help I can. "
2432, [Tunnels] 
2433," IAN: Well, whatever's out there hasn't attacked us"
2434,yet. 
2435,(Roaring sound) 
2436,"DOCTOR: Courage, my boy, both hands. Come on. "
2437,IAN: Doctor. Something moved slightly up ahead of us. 
2438,(The Doctor rolls up the map to make a club and gives it to Ian. He
2439,sneaks up on something or someone but they get away) 
2440,"IAN: Doctor, it was a man! I know it was. "
2441,DOCTOR: Are you sure? 
2442,IAN: Yes. Look. This came away in the struggle. 
2443,"DOCTOR: It looks like a shoulder flash. I-N-E-E-R. Yes, just as I"
2444,suspected. It must be one of those survivors from the spaceship that
2445,exploded. 
2446,IAN: Why should they come here? 
2447,DOCTOR: To hide and poison the water. 
2448,"IAN: Yes, but why poison the water in the first place. "
2449,DOCTOR: Let's go and ask him. 
2450, [Reception room] 
2451, (There's a scale model on a table) 
2452,BARBARA: This is the entrance to the aqueduct. 
2453,1ST ELDER: Yes. 
2454,"BARBARA: Tell me, do you think I could use one of your mind"
2455,transmitters? 
2456,1ST ELDER: You have my permission to try. But how will it help you? 
2457,"BARBARA: John and I will go down to the aqueduct, Susan will stay here"
2458,and direct us. 
2459,"SUSAN: Yes, then we can guide them both out. "
2460,1ST ELDER: My scientists tell me that you do not require the use of our
2461,mind transmitter. 
2462,"SUSAN: Well, I've always been able to read your mind, but only when you"
2463,allowed me to. 
2464,1ST ELDER: Your mind must be finely tuned. The frequencies covering the
2465,surface of the Sensphere are numerous. You must be able to break in on
2466,the major ones. 
2467,BARBARA: Well I can't. Do you mind if I try your invention? 
2468,1ST ELDER: Hold it to your forehead and try to close your mind to
2469,everything but the person to whom you wish to communicate. It is safe
2470,provided you do not allow your concentration to slip. 
2471,"BARBARA: All right. Susan, let's try a little experiment. "
2472,SUSAN: Right. (a moment of telepathy) The entrance to the aqueduct is
2473,there. 
2474,"BARBARA: It works. Well, there's no point in delaying. As soon as John"
2475,"and I reach the entrance, you start directing us. All right? "
2476,SUSAN: All right. Carol'll be here to help me. 
2477,"BARBARA: Good. Oh, by the way, I would like one of your warriors left"
2478,here with Susan. 
2479,"SUSAN: Yes, one that you trust implicitly. "
2480,1ST ELDER: I trust all Sensorites. You will be guarded safely. 
2481,"SUSAN: Thank you. Please find them, Barbara. "
2482,(Barbara leaves) 
2483,1ST ELDER: A very capable human being. 
2484,"SUSAN: Yes, she is. "
2485,"1ST ELDER: Gentle, yet with strong determination and courage. "
2486,BOTH: I was going to 
2487,"SUSAN: I was going to say, why do you trust your people? "
2488,1ST ELDER: Why do you want to make me doubt them? 
2489,SUSAN: Trust can't be taken for granted. It must be earned. I trust
2490,"you, but only because I know you. "
2491,"1ST ELDER: But Susan, our whole life is based on trust. "
2492,"SUSAN: Yes, and that might be your downfall. Look you don't trust the"
2493,"ground you walk on until you know it's firm, do you. So why trust your"
2494,people blindly? 
2495,"1ST ELDER: When I listen to you, you who are so young among your own"
2496,"kind, I realise that we Sensorites have a lot to learn from the people"
2497,of Earth. 
2498,"SUSAN: Grandfather and I don't come from Earth. Oh, it's ages since"
2499,"we've seen our planet. It's quite like Earth, but at night the sky is a"
2500,"burned orange, and the leaves on the trees are bright silver. "
2501,"1ST ELDER: My mind tells me that you wish to see your home again, and"
2502,yet there is a part of you which calls for adventure. A wanderlust. 
2503,"SUSAN: Yes. Well, we'll all go home some day. That's if you'll let us. "
2504,1ST ELDER: I think I will. 
2505, [Tunnels] 
2506, IAN: We could be going round in circles. 
2507,"DOCTOR: No, no, my boy. No, no, no, no. I'm marking these, the"
2508,"sections, the pipes. "
2509,IAN: Uncanny. It's so quiet. 
2510,DOCTOR: Yes. Perhaps they're preparing an ambush. 
2511,"IAN: You're a cheerful soul, I must say. "
2512,"DOCTOR: I assure you, dear boy, my spirits couldn't be higher."
2513,"Collecting evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, calculating it,"
2514,pursuing it until it's inevitable. It's fascinating. 
2515,(Ian is staring at a bearded figure) 
2516,IAN: Doctor. 
2517,"DOCTOR: Oh, don't interrupt, young boy. It's most irritating. "
2518,(Then the Doctor sees a figure too) 
2519,DOCTOR: Chesterton. 
2520,IAN: I know. I've been trying to tell you. 
2521,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, it's all right. Let's back up and perhaps we can"
2522,jump out on them. 
2523,(Then they realise they are caught between two people) 
2524,"IAN: You were right about the ambush, weren't you. "
2525,DOCTOR: Yes. Don't do anything to alarm them. 
2526,MAN 1: (nearest the Doctor) You have come at last. 
2527,DOCTOR: We came to find you. 
2528,IAN: That's right. 
2529,"MAN 2; Watch them, Number One. "
2530,MAN 1: We have been waiting for you. Are they all dead? 
2531,DOCTOR: Dead? 
2532,"IAN: The Sensorites, you mean? "
2533,"MAN 1: Yes, the Sensorites. Do you have a spaceship? "
2534,DOCTOR: Yes. 
2535,MAN 1: Are there more of you? 
2536,IAN: No. 
2537,MAN 2: No others in the channels at all? You haven't brought the
2538,Sensorites with you? 
2539,IAN: No. 
2540,DOCTOR: Wouldn't you like to leave these tunnels and go out into the
2541,sunshine again? 
2542,"MAN 1: No, they would hear our minds talking. Follow me. He is going to"
2543,talk to you. 
2544,"DOCTOR: Yes, I thought there'd be a third. "
2545,"MAN 1: Yes, the Commander. You'll have to talk to him. Follow me. "
2546,"(Meanwhile, John and Barbara arrive at the aqueduct, and Barbara"
2547,contacts Susan) 
2548, [Reception room] 
2549, SUSAN: They're entering the aqueduct now. It's a
2550,little indistinct. 
2551,"CAROL: Well, tell her to speak to you. You do the same. "
2552,"SUSAN: All right. Barbara, speak the words as you think them. Oh,"
2553,that's better. 
2554, [Aqueduct] 
2555," BARBARA: Yes, all right, Susan. We're to go"
2556,"straight ahead to start with, and then keep turning to the right. "
2557,JOHN: Right. I'll lead. 
2558, [Reception room] 
2559, SUSAN: They're beginning now. 
2560, [Tunnels] 
2561, MAN 1: You'll give us your word you're alone. 
2562,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, definitely. "
2563, JOHN: There's something here. It's the Doctor's
2564,"map, all right. I remember the senior Scientist drawing it in the"
2565,laboratory. 
2566,BARBARA: But it's all screwed up. They must have realised it was
2567,useless. 
2568,JOHN: Shall we take it with us? 
2569,"BARBARA: Yes, we'll need it as proof that the maps were tampered with. "
2570, [Reception room] 
2571, 1ST ELDER: How is it progressing? 
2572,SUSAN: They haven't found them yet. 
2573,"CAROL: Well, at least they found the map. "
2574,"SUSAN: Oh, Barbara's talking to me again. "
2575, [Tunnels] 
2576, JOHN: No doubt about it. 
2577,"BARBARA: John says this is a fresh mark, probably made by the Doctor."
2578,"We're going to try and follow these marks, Susan. So instead of you"
2579,"directing us, we'll tell you what route we're going to take. "
2580,"JOHN: Let's hope they were made by the Doctor, that's all. "
2581,
2582,"(Elsewhere, the Doctor marks another pipe with chalk) "
2583,"DOCTOR: In case we have to make a run for it, my boy. "
2584,"IAN: I'm glad you're on my side, Doctor. "
2585, [Reception room] 
2586," SUSAN: That's right, Barbara. She's going down"
2587,this channel now. 
2588,1ST ELDER: And no harm has come to them yet. Perhaps the Doctor and Ian
2589,are chasing the creatures in the aqueduct. 
2590,SUSAN: Or they've been captured. 
2591, [Tunnels] 
2592," MAN 1: Wait here. The new arrivals are here,"
2593,Commander. 
2594,COMMANDER: This is the best news I've had for a long time. (shakes
2595,their hands) I'm very glad to see you both. Did you have a rough
2596,"journey? Yes, of course. I'm sure you must have done. Let's have"
2597,"something to sit down on, Number One. "
2598,"MAN 1: Yes, sir. They're very rough quarters here. You'll have to"
2599,excuse that. But I'm sure you're both used to battle stations by now.
2600,"Yes. Excuse me. Number Two, you can take over ammunition detail now."
2601,You'll find the new supplies all ready. Hide it in pipe number seven
2602,"this time. All right, carry on. "
2603,(Man 2 leaves) 
2604,COMMANDER: Number One? 
2605,"MAN 1: Yes, sir. "
2606,"COMMANDER: Organise a lecture for Number Two, will you? Civility isn't"
2607,"for me, you understand, it's for the uniform. Understood? "
2608,"MAN 1: Yes, sir. "
2609,"COMMANDER: Have to keep discipline up, you know. But they're all good"
2610,"men. Very fine, Morale's very high here. Sit down. "
2611,"IAN: Well, you have a very well ordered base here, sir. "
2612,COMMANDER: It's very good of you to say so. 
2613,DOCTOR: We have a surprise for you. The war with the Sensorites is
2614,over. 
2615,COMMANDER: Is that true? 
2616,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. "
2617,"COMMANDER: And the planet's ours now, is it? Completely? "
2618,IAN: Completely. 
2619,"COMMANDER: Well, this is absolutely wonderful! We nearly lost, you"
2620,"know. I had command of a fine spaceship, very fine. Two of my men"
2621,"deserted, pretended they had to go back to Earth to get reinforcements."
2622,
2623,DOCTOR: So you had to blow up your spaceship. 
2624,"COMMANDER: Yes. Still, I suppose I'll get another one. I'll be able to"
2625,afford it now. Planet's very rich 
2626,"IAN: Oh, yes. Molybdenum. "
2627,"COMMANDER: Oh, you know about that, do you? You do realise this war has"
2628,been fought by me and my men here. Any treasure trove is ours. 
2629,"DOCTOR: That's quite understandable, isn't it, Chesterton. "
2630,"COMMANDER: And I'm prepared to back that statement up with force, if"
2631,"necessary. I have good supplies here. Loyal men. Of course, we're just"
2632,"discussing this. But you are alone, aren't you. Hardly in a position to"
2633,"fight me. And I have my men, and my organisation. "
2634,MAN 1: Commander. Warning in route two. 
2635,COMMANDER: What? Have you been telling me lies? You've brought other
2636,"people with you, haven't you? "
2637,MAN 1: Perhaps they're really allies of the Sensorites. 
2638,"COMMANDER: No, Number One, not allies. Spies. The war isn't over at"
2639,"all, is it. I thought it was a bit too good to be true. "
2640,IAN: Now just a minutes. We knew nothing this warning system of yours 
2641,"COMMANDER: No, of course you didn't, and it's tripped you up, hasn't"
2642,"it? Number One, there'll be a court martial. Immediately. Treason. "
2643,IAN: Barbara! 
2644,BARBARA: Ian. 
2645,IAN: What on Earth are you doing here? 
2646,(babble of greetings between the four) 
2647,COMMANDER: What's this? Who are these people? 
2648,"DOCTOR: I'm afraid you misjudged us, sir. These people are part of the"
2649,"committee, here to welcome you. We all came down here to take you out"
2650,again to the surface. 
2651,"IAN: To celebrate your success, sir. "
2652,BARBARA: What's going on? 
2653,IAN: Play it cool. 
2654,COMMANDER: And who is this? 
2655,IAN: This is our navigator. She is going to lead us back. 
2656,"COMMANDER: Well, I'm glad the fighting's over. Look forward to a bit of"
2657,a rest now for a while. 
2658,"DOCTOR: Yes, you deserve it, sir. So do your men. And I think the"
2659,"sooner we take you out into the sunshine, the better. "
2660,"COMMANDER: Number One, assemble the men, please. We'll be leaving"
2661,immediately. It seems we have a victory to celebrate. You might pass on
2662,"my congratulations to the men, Number One. "
2663,"MAN 1: Thank you very much, sir. "
2664,"COMMANDER: Shall we move, then? "
2665, [Aqueduct] 
2666, (The chief Warrior and a guard are getting their
2667,instructions) 
2668,WARRIOR: They are coming. You will take up your position just by the
2669,"entrance, there. When they have all come through, you will step out and"
2670,prevent anyone from escaping back into the aqueduct. Now take your
2671,place. 
2672,"(Two ragged men, John, Barbara and Ian emerge) "
2673,WARRIOR: It is useless to resist. 
2674,(The men drop their pointed sticks) 
2675,"IAN: Don't worry. I think we can handle these two. Lead on, Barbara. "
2676,"(They go off, and the Doctor and the Commander come out) "
2677,"COMMANDER: Come back here, you men. Treachery. "
2678,DOCTOR: It's all over now. 
2679,COMMANDER: Treachery! 
2680,(The Warrior uses his paralyser on him) 
2681,"DOCTOR: Pitiful fellow. Oh, I know he did your people incalculable"
2682,harm. 
2683,WARRIOR: I could have killed him. I wanted to. But that would not be
2684,"the way, would it. "
2685,DOCTOR: No. 
2686,WARRIOR: He could have destroyed the entire Sensorite nation. 
2687,"DOCTOR: Yes, but the fact is, you didn't kill him. Shows great promise"
2688,for the future of your people. 
2689, [Reception room] 
2690, IAN: Captain Maitland has agreed to take the
2691,others back to Earth. 
2692,BARBARA: They were completely insane. They really believed they were at
2693,war with you. 
2694,"1ST ELDER: At some time, they must have opened their minds, or"
2695,experimented with the mind transmitters. Every really rational thought
2696,"was crushed out, and all they had left was the game they played. The"
2697,game of war. 
2698,BARBARA: What about the Second Elder? 
2699,1ST ELDER: You finding the map proves his treachery. He will be
2700,banished to the outer wastes. 
2701,"IAN: Well, I think we must go back to the ship, sir. "
2702,"1ST ELDER: Yes, you must go. The lock has already been sealed back in"
2703,"it's proper place. So go your way now, and take the gratitude of the"
2704,Sensorites with you. 
2705,IAN: Thank you. 
2706,BARBARA: Goodbye. 
2707, [Tardis] 
2708," DOCTOR: Where are those other two, hmm? "
2709,SUSAN: They're coming. 
2710,"DOCTOR: What's the matter, my child? "
2711,SUSAN: I had a talk with the senior Scientist just before we left. It
2712,seems that the Sensphere has an extraordinary number of ultra high
2713,"frequencies, so I won't be able to go on using thought transference. "
2714,"DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know. It's rather a relief, I think. After all, no"
2715,"one likes an eavesdropper about, do they. No, I think you obviously"
2716,"have a gift in that direction. When we get home to our own place, I"
2717,think we should try and perfect it. 
2718,"SUSAN: When will we get back, Grandfather? "
2719,"DOCTOR: I don't know, my dear. This old ship of mine seems to be an"
2720,"aimless thing. However, we don't worry about it, do we? Do you? "
2721,"SUSAN: Sometimes I feel I'd like to belong somewhere, not just be a"
2722,"wanderer. Still, I'm not unhappy. "
2723,"DOCTOR: Good, good. "
2724,(Ian and Barbara enter) 
2725,"IAN: Well, here we are. "
2726,DOCTOR: Always last. I very nearly went off without you. 
2727,BARBARA: We were saying goodbye to John and Carol. 
2728,"DOCTOR: Let's have a look at Maitland and see him off, shall we? "
2729,(The scanner shows the ship heading into the stars) 
2730,"IAN: Well, at least they know where they're going. "
2731,DOCTOR: Implying I don't? 
2732,IAN: I didn't mean anything 
2733,"DOCTOR: So, you think I'm an incompetent old fool, do you? "
2734,"IAN: Now, Doctor, I never said that. "
2735,"DOCTOR: Since you are so dissatisfied, my boy, you can get off the"
2736,"ship. At the very next place we stop, I shall take you off myself, and"
2737,that is quite final. Carry on.
