22, [Hallway] 
23, (It is evening. In a grand old house complete with
24,"tapestries on the wall and long case clock ticking away the decades, a"
25,UNIT soldier stands guard. An efficient middle-aged woman speaks to
26,him.) 
27,"PAGET: You will be sure that nobody disturbs him, won't you? "
28,(Miss Paget goes up the stairs.)
29,
30, [Study] 
31," (Sir Reginald Styles, a silver-haired man, sits at"
32,"his desk, writing with a proper fountain pen and using a blotter. A"
33,breeze blows the curtains and he goes over to discover a man in
34,camouflage dress with a non-contemporary weapon.) 
35,STYLES: What the? 
36,(The intruder pushes Styles until he is lying across the back of a
37,chesterfield.) 
38,"STYLES: Ah, no, no! No! "
39,"(Just as it seems Styles is about to be shot, there is a strange light"
40,"and sound effect, and the intruder vanishes. Miss Paget enters.) "
41,PAGET: Sir Reginald? Are you all right? What happened? 
42,STYLES: He attacked me. Tried to kill me. 
43,PAGET: Who did? What happened? 
44,"STYLES: He vanished. Disappeared into thin air, like a ghost. "
45,(The French windows are open.)
46,
47, [UNIT Office]
48,
49, (The Brigadier answers the telephone.) 
50,BRIGADIER: Lethbridge-Stewart? 
51,MAN : Ah. I have the Minister for you. 
52,MINISTER : Hello? 
53,"BRIGADIER: Oh, good. Put him through, will you? "
54,MINISTER : Hello? Hello? 
55,"BRIGADIER: Good morning, Minister. "
56,MINISTER : I've just been on to Auderly House. I've rather had some
57,rather disturbing news. 
58,"BRIGADIER: Yes. Yes, I've seen the report from Miss er, Miss Paget. It"
59,doesn't seem to be very much to go on. 
60,MINISTER : I don't need to tell you how critical the situation is. 
61,"BRIGADIER: Yes, Minister. I'm very well aware of Sir Reginald's"
62,importance in these negotiations. 
63,MINISTER : Then you're proposing to do nothing about it. 
64,"BRIGADIER: No, Minister. I do not propose to ignore the matter. I'm"
65,"putting my best man onto it. As a matter of fact, I was just about to"
66,brief him when you rang.
67,
68, [UNIT Laboratory]
69,
70, (The Doctor has the Tardis console in the room and
71,"is working on the dematerialisation circuit, as usual.) "
72,"JO: Doctor, why don't you take a break? "
73,"DOCTOR: It's maddening, you know. So nearly there. If I could only cut"
74,out their override on the dematerialisation circuit. Let me see those
75,figures. 
76,JO: Doctor? I thought the Tardis was working again. 
77,DOCTOR: What gave you that idea? 
78,"JO: Oh, being dragged off to an alien planet five hundred years in the"
79,"future, for example. Oh, you know, all that business with the miners"
80,and the colonists. 
81,"DOCTOR: My dear Jo, the Tardis was being operated then under remote"
82,control by the High Council of the Time Lords. 
83,"JO: Well, if it worked for them. "
84,DOCTOR: I don't want it to work for them. I want it to work for me. No
85,"one's going to turn me into an interplanetary puppet. Yes, of course."
86,Why didn't I think of that before? 
87,(The Doctor goes underneath the console. A moment later the doors to
88,the lab open and a second Doctor and Jo are standing there.) 
89,"DOCTOR 2: Yes, of course, I remember now. Look, don't worry, my dear. I"
90,know you're alarmed but you needn't be. 
91,"DOCTOR: Yes, well I think that should do it. Why on Earth I never"
92,realised that. 
93,(Then the Doctor sees himself standing there.) 
94,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. What are you doing here? "
95,"DOCTOR 2: Well, I'm not here. Don't worry. Well, that is, in a sense I"
96,"am here, but you are not there. Yes, well, it's a bit difficult to"
97,explain really. 
98,DOCTOR: This won't do at all. We can't have two of us running about. 
99,"DOCTOR 2: Yes, well don't worry. It will all sort itself "
100,"(Flash, bang from the console and the duplicates vanish.) "
101,JO: Doctor? What happened? 
102,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a very complicated thing, time, Jo. Once you've"
103,"begun tampering with it, the oddest things start happening. "
104,"JO: But there was another you and another me. Well, where've they gone?"
105,
106,"DOCTOR: Back into their own time stream, of course. Or do I mean"
107,forward? 
108,"JO: But, Doctor, I don't understand. "
109,"DOCTOR: Look, Jo, don't worry about it. It was a freak affect. It's"
110,very unlikely to happen again. Hold that and give me those papers. 
111,(The Brigadier enters.) 
112,"BRIGADIER: Ah, Doctor. Glad you're still here. I need your help. "
113,"DOCTOR: Sorry, Brigadier. I'm busy. "
114,"BRIGADIER: Yeah, so am I, Doctor, so am I. Now then, you've heard of"
115,Sir Reginald Styles? 
116,"DOCTOR: No, can't say that I have. "
117,"JO: Well, isn't he the chief representative at the UN? "
118,BRIGADIER: That's right. Key figure at the latest summit conference. 
119,"DOCTOR: My dear chap, I'm a scientist, not a politician. "
120,"BRIGADIER: You know, Doctor, if you didn't spend so much time tinkering"
121,"around with this wretched contraption, you'd realise just how bad the"
122,international situation's become. 
123,"DOCTOR: Humans are always squabbling over something, Brigadier. "
124,"BRIGADIER: Yes, well, this particular squabble looks like ending up in"
125,a third world war. The Chinese delegation have refused to attend.
126,"Without them, the conference can't even begin. Now Styles is flying to"
127,Peking in a few hours. There's just a chance that he can persuade them
128,to change their minds. 
129,"DOCTOR: All right, Brigadier. So what's his problem? "
130,"BRIGADIER: Well, he was working late last night, down at Auderly. "
131,JO: Where's that? 
132,"BRIGADIER: Auderly, Miss Grant, is a Government owned country house"
133,about fifty miles north of London where the conference is due to be
134,held. 
135,JO: Oh. 
136,BRIGADIER: He suddenly started behaving rather oddly. Seemed to think
137,that someone was trying to assassinate him. 
138,DOCTOR: Any idea who? 
139,"BRIGADIER: Some sort of ghost, apparently."
140,
141, [Auderly]
142,
143, (The peace of the lawns near the house is
144,"disturbed by the light and sound effect of the previous night, which"
145,this time deposits a man in the middle of the meadow. He runs for
146,"cover, looks towards the house then flees as a strange sound starts up."
147,"- note, this is Dropmore House in Buckinghamshire, which was almost"
148,destroyed by fires twice in the 1990s. He runs along a path to a
149,railway bridge over a canal. Suddenly a large grey-skinned alien with
150,heavy brows and jaw knocks him down the slope. The alien and his
151,"companion walk down the slope, see that the man is unconscious, then go"
152,into a tunnel under the bridge.)
153,
154,[Study]
155,
156, PAGET: He said somebody attacked him and vanished.
157,
158,DOCTOR: And you're absolutely certain that he used the word ghost? 
159,PAGET: Oh yes. But afterwards he 
160,(Styles enters.) 
161,STYLES: Miss Paget. What's going on here? 
162,"PAGET: These people are from UNIT, sir. "
163,STYLES: Who asked them to come here? 
164,"PAGET: I did, because of what happened yesterday. "
165,STYLES: Nothing happened yesterday. 
166,"BRIGADIER: There seems to have been some sort of incident, Sir"
167,Reginald? 
168,STYLES: Nothing of any importance. 
169,"JO: Well, if you could tell us what happened? "
170,STYLES: I was working late. I must have dropped off. Freak gust of wind
171,blew some papers off my desk. I woke up rather confused. I was picking
172,up the papers when Miss Paget came in. 
173,BRIGADIER: But you did mention ghosts. 
174,STYLES: Did I? Must have been having a nightmare. 
175,PAGET: But the French windows were shut. I closed them before I went to
176,bed. 
177,STYLES: Then I must have opened them. 
178,DOCTOR: Did you also make those marks on the floor over there? Muddy
179,"feet, Sir Reginald. Someone was in here, you know. "
180,"STYLES: Are you accusing me of lying, sir? "
181,"BRIGADIER: Sir Reginald, you've obviously been under considerable"
182,strain recently. Were you feeling at all unwell last night? 
183,"STYLES: I felt, and feel, perfectly well. Now, if you'll excuse me,"
184,I've a lot to do. I'm due at the airport in an hour. 
185,BRIGADIER: You've no objection to my men searching the grounds? 
186,STYLES: None at all. Though I really don't know what you hope to find. 
187, [Railway bridge]
188,
189," (Soldiers, the Doctor and the Brigadier are"
190,"combing the grounds thoroughly, and two are looking over the bridge to"
191,the canal. The unconscious man is spotted.) 
192,SOLDIER: He's over here! 
193,"(Benton, the Doctor, the Brigadier and Yates go along the towpath to"
194,the man.) 
195,SOLDIER: Sergeant! 
196,(Benton leaves.) 
197,"DOCTOR: Oh, he's in a bad way, poor chap. You'd better get him to the"
198,hospital. 
199,BRIGADIER: Captain Yates. 
200,"YATES: Right away, sir. "
201,(Yates leaves. The Brigadier picks up the man's strange weapon.) 
202,"BRIGADIER: It's a new one on me. What do you make of it, Doctor? "
203,DOCTOR: I'm not sure. 
204,(Benton returns with a case on a strap.) 
205,BENTON: Sir? 
206,"BRIGADIER: What've you got there, Benton? "
207,"BENTON: I've no idea, sir. It was hidden about fifty feet inside the"
208,"tunnel. Must have been put there recently, I reckon. "
209,(The case is full of circuitry.)
210,
211, [Control room]
212,
213, (A man in a green high necked suit sits in a
214,padded wrap-around chair like a cross between Ernst Stavro Blofeld and
215,Number Two. He is played by  Aubrey Woods doing a
216,good Charles Gray imitation. The decor of the room is also mainly
217,"green, with young women sitting at various consoles. The big grey"
218,aliens - Ogrons - enter.) 
219,CONTROLLER: Your report? 
220,"(The Ogrons speak slowly, with a mouth full of large teeth."
221,Klingonesque in a way.) 
222,OGRON: We found and destroyed the enemy. 
223,CONTROLLER: Any complications? 
224,OGRON: No complications. 
225,CONTROLLER: Good. They will be satisfied. I did not say dismiss. I want
226,an intensified effort. There can be no relaxation. Not until we have
227,found all those responsible for this menace and eliminated them too.
228,Now you may go. Keep me informed of all developments.
229,
230, [Study]
231,
232,"(Styles enters, and looks shocked at the sight of"
233,the strange weapon.) 
234,BRIGADIER: Have you seen this before? 
235,"STYLES: Really, Brigadier. What sort of games are you playing? "
236,"BRIGADIER: It's not a game, sir. It's our duty to protect you. "
237,STYLES: I don't need your protection. 
238,"DOCTOR: Sir Reginald, we've just found a very severely injured man down"
239,by the canal tunnel. 
240,STYLES: Oh really? And what did he look like? 
241,"BRIGADIER: Thirty five-ish, average build. He was wearing a sort of"
242,guerilla combat suit. 
243,DOCTOR: And carrying that gun. 
244,"STYLES: I am very sorry, gentlemen, but I have rather more important"
245,things on my mind at the moment. If you'll excuse me. 
246,"BRIGADIER: I'll arrange an escort to take you to the airport, sir. "
247,"STYLES: Thank you, but it shouldn't be necessary. "
248,"BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, sir, but I think it will. "
249,"STYLES: Oh, if you insist. "
250,(Styles leaves.) 
251,DOCTOR: I'd like to get that gun down to the laboratory and run a few
252,tests on it. 
253,BRIGADIER: Anything else we can do? 
254,"DOCTOR: No, not for the moment. I think we'll just have to sit and wait"
255,and hope that our would-be assassin regains consciousness.
256,
257, [Ambulance]
258,
259," YATES: And stay with him every moment, Benton."
260,Take down anything he says. Anything at all. 
261,"BENTON: Leave it to me, sir."
262,
263, [UNIT Laboratory]
264,
265, (The weapon has been set up in front of a firing
266,range.) 
267,"DOCTOR: Well, basically it's a form of ultra-sonic disintegrator. "
268,JO: You mean a ray gun? 
269,"DOCTOR: That's right, Jo, I mean a ray gun. Only it's far more"
270,sophisticated than any weapon yet invented on Earth. Now take a look at
271,this. 
272,(The Doctor fires the weapon. The target vanishes in a flash of white
273,light.) 
274,"DOCTOR: Quite an effective little weapon, eh? "
275,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, you say this wasn't made on Earth. Do you mean it"
276,comes from another planet? 
277,"DOCTOR: Well, that was my theory at first, yes, but the metallurgical"
278,analysis shows that the iron constituent is very much of this world. In
279,"fact, it was mined not very far from here. North Wales. "
280,BRIGADIER: How do you explain that? 
281,"DOCTOR: Do you believe in ghosts, Brigadier? "
282,"BRIGADIER: Let's be serious, Doctor. "
283,DOCTOR: I am. 
284,"BRIGADIER: Oh, come along, Doctor, come along. "
285,"DOCTOR: Oh, my mistake. I was forgetting the unimaginative nature of"
286,the military mind. But we saw a couple of amicas seperatas a few
287,"moments ago, didn't we, Jo? "
288,JO: Did we? 
289,"DOCTOR: Yes, here in this laboratory. "
290,"JO: Oh, you mean when we "
291,"DOCTOR: Mind you, they were manifestations of a much more benevolent"
292,"kind. None of your clanking chains and chilly fingers, but ghosts, none"
293,the less. 
294,JO: That was because you were playing around with the time mechanism on
295,"the Tardis, wasn't it? "
296,"BRIGADIER: Still can't get it to work, eh? "
297,(The Doctor picks up the case the soldiers found.) 
298,"DOCTOR: Well, I can't get this thing to work, either. But this is a"
299,"form of time machine, of a very crude kind. "
300,JO: How do you know? 
301,DOCTOR: Come over here. Look at this. Now what do you think that is? 
302,JO: It's a mini-dematerialisation circuit. 
303,"DOCTOR: Top of the class, Jo. Now then, pop this in here, like that. "
304,(He puts the little circuit into an inset in the case.) 
305,"DOCTOR: Now, as far as I can gather, when you push this button, it"
306,should 
307,(The light display starts.) 
308,DOCTOR: Good grief! It's working! 
309,"(And in the ambulance, the patient vanishes from under Benton's actual"
310,nose.)
311,
312, [Control room]
313,
314, TECHNICIAN: Sir? 
315,CONTROLLER: What is it? 
316,"TECHNICIAN: Time transmitter in operation, sir. Twentieth century zone."
317,
318,CONTROLLER: Can you fix the space-time coordinates? 
319,"TECHNICIAN: I'm trying, sir, but it's very faint and erratic."
320,
321, [UNIT Laboratory]
322,
323," JO: Do be careful, Doctor. "
324,"DOCTOR: All right, Jo, all right."
325,
326, [Control room]
327,
328, CONTROLLER: Well? 
329,"TECHNICIAN: No good, sir. There was a transference, I think, but the"
330,machine's cut out completely. 
331,CONTROLLER: Continue scanning. And next time you had better be more
332,efficient. 
333,"(The Controller looks at a large, golden, perpetually annoyed"
334,pepperpot.) 
335,DALEK: Report!
336,
337, [UNIT Laboratory]
338,
339, (The case has stopped working.) 
340,"DOCTOR: Well, the thing's completely dead now. "
341,JO: But it was working. 
342,"DOCTOR: Yes, it started to work. Oh, I see, yes. Yes, the temporal"
343,feedback circuit has overloaded. 
344,BRIGADIER: The what's done what? 
345,"DOCTOR: In your terms, Brigadier, the thing's blown a fuse. "
346,(The intercom buzzes.) 
347,DOCTOR: Please. 
348,"BRIGADIER: Lethbridge Stewart? Yes, Sergeant. Really. You're sure? Yes,"
349,"I see. All right, Sergeant, you'd better report back to Captain Yates."
350,Goodbye. That was Benton. He was in the ambulance with the man we
351,found. 
352,DOCTOR: Well? 
353,"BRIGADIER: Well, according to him, that man just vanished. Faded away"
354,like a ghost. 
355,"JO: Oh, no. "
356,"BRIGADIER: Well, Doctor, what now? "
357,"DOCTOR: Well, everything that happens seems to centre round Styles'"
358,house. 
359,BRIGADIER: Obviously. 
360,"DOCTOR: And whoever tried to harm him will probably try again. Jo, how"
361,would you like to spend the night in a haunted house?
362,
363, [Study] 
364," (Jo shuts the French windows, locking out the"
365,"night. The Doctor enters with a tray, carrying a bottle and two"
366,"glasses, and a cheese board.) "
367,"DOCTOR: You know, one thing you can be certain of with politicians, is"
368,"that whatever their political ideas, they always keep a well-stocked"
369,larder. Not to mention the cellar. 
370,"JO: Doctor, ought you just to help yourself like that? "
371,"DOCTOR: Well, you heard what Miss Paget said, Jo. We were to treat the"
372,place as our own. 
373,JO: I wish you hadn't sent all the servants away. 
374,DOCTOR: That's common sense. You can't expect a ghost to walk in a
375,"house full of people, can you? Come on, tuck in. "
376,"JO: Well, I'm not really hungry, thank you, Doctor. "
377,"DOCTOR: Well, you ought to eat something, you know. This is likely to"
378,be a very long night. 
379,(Jo jumps as a bell chimes.) 
380,JO: What's that? 
381,"DOCTOR: It's a clock chiming. I say, you really ought to try this"
382,gorgonzola cheese. It's absolutely delicious. 
383,[Terrace]
384,
385,(A bunch of squaddies run along the gravel path.) 
386,BENTON: Move! 
387,(Yates is reporting in on a Land Rover's R/T.) 
388,YATES: Hello? Hello? Greyhound to Trap One. Greyhound to Trap One. How
389,do you read me? Over. 
390,"BENTON: All the lads are in position, sir. "
391,"YATES: Thank you, Benton. Quiet so far? "
392,BENTON: Like a morgue. 
393,(The strange light starts to pulse out of the tunnel under the railway
394,bridge.)
395,
396, [Study]
397,
398, (The Doctor has moved on from the cheese to the
399,wine.) 
400,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, that's a most good humoured wine. A touch sardonic"
401,"perhaps, but not cynical. Yes, a most civilised wine. One after my own"
402,heart.
403,
404, [Hallway] 
405, (Jo leaves the study and starts to go up the
406,stairs when someone enters.) 
407,"BENTON: Everything all right, miss? "
408,JO: It was until you came along. You took years off my life creeping
409,about like that. 
410,"BENTON: Well, I didn't want to disturb the Doc. What's he up to? "
411,"JO: Well, at the moment, he's carrying on rather like a one man food"
412,and wine society. 
413,"BENTON: Oh, talking of food, you, er, you couldn't get us a bite to"
414,"eat, could you, miss? I'm famished. "
415,JO: Hang on.
416,
417, [Study] 
418, (Jo picks up the plate of cheeses and the second
419,glass of wine.) 
420,DOCTOR: Jo? 
421,JO: All in a good cause.
422,
423, [Hallway] 
424," BENTON: Ah, you've saved my life. "
425,(But before he can even cut into a piece of cheese.) 
426,YATES : Sergeant Benton! 
427,BENTON: Sir! (sotto) No. 
428,"YATES: Just what do you think you're up to, Benton? "
429,"BENTON: I was just checking, sir. "
430,"YATES: Yes, well I want you to go and check on number three patrol."
431,"Move, Sergeant Benton. "
432,BENTON: Sir. 
433,(Benton leaves.) 
434,"YATES: Jo, how thoughtful. "
435,(Yates has a drink of the wine.) 
436,JO: That wasn't very kind of you. 
437,"YATES: RHIP, Jo. "
438,JO: Pardon? 
439,YATES: Rank Has Its Privileges. Thank you.
440,
441, [Study] 
442, DOCTOR: And what was all that about? 
443,JO: Feeding the troops. 
444,"DOCTOR: Oh, quite right. Do you know, I remember saying to old"
445,"Napoleon. Boney, I said, always remember an army marches on its"
446,stomach. 
447,"JO: Well, Mike Yates certainly does. Doctor? "
448,DOCTOR: Mmm? 
449,JO: You didn't mean what you said to the Brigadier about ghosts? 
450,"DOCTOR: Well, there are many different kinds of ghosts, Jo. Ghosts from"
451,the past and ghosts from the future. 
452,"JO: Well, what kind did you have in mind? "
453,"DOCTOR: What's more to the point is, have they got us in mind? "
454,(The French windows blow open.) 
455,JO: What 
456,DOCTOR: It's just the wind. 
457,(The Doctor closes the windows and draws the curtains.) 
458,"DOCTOR: Look, why don't you take a nap?"
459,
460, [Railway bridge] 
461," (The light display happens, and three figures in"
462,"camouflage gear appear, two men and a woman.) "
463,ANAT: (woman) We'll wait here till it's light. 
464,SHURA: (moustache) Time waste 
465,"ANAT: I said, we'll wait."
466,
467, [Study]
468,
469, (Jo sleeps in a leather armchair as the Doctor
470,works on the case. It is about 7 am. and the birds are singing.) 
471,"DOCTOR: Wake up, Jo. It's all right. It's morning. "

720,century visiting the twentieth. A planned expedition through time to
721,"meet and kill an important politician. Now, why? "
722,JO: I'm the one who's supposed to be asking the questions. 
723,"DOCTOR: He's obviously not only important to us, he's also important to"
724,"them. Or history, their history, must talk a lot about Sir Reginald"
725,"Styles, I think. "
726,"JO: You mean, they travelled back in our time to try and change"
727,history? 
728,"DOCTOR: That's it, yes. How are you doing? "
729,JO: Not very well. These knots are rock hard.

958,JO: How can I help? 
959,"CONTROLLER: Well, first of all, I shall want to know exactly where you"
960,came from and when. 
961,"JO: Well, we were at Sir Reginald Styles' house, about fifty miles from"
962,London. 
963,"CONTROLLER: Now, you've told me the year. Can you tell me the exact"
964,date? 
965,JO: That's easy. It was September the 13th. 
966,"CONTROLLER: Excellent. Now, you must be tired, you must be hungry. We"
967,"do have special guest rooms. Leave everything to me. Oh, there is one"
968,"last question. These criminals, can you tell me exactly where they"
969,"entered your time? I mean, did they manifest themselves in the house"
970,itself? 
971,JO: I don't think so. 
972,CONTROLLER: Somewhere outside the house? Some hiding place? 
973,"JO: I don't know for sure, but there's a tunnel by a canal not far from"
974,the house. We found that time machine there. 
975,CONTROLLER: A tunnel. Thank you. I'll call you as soon as we have any
976,news.

983,transfer point. We will prepare an ambush in the twentieth century time
984,zone. 
985,CONTROLLER : We have security forces in the area. With any
986,"luck, they will drive the guerillas straight into our hands. I shall"

1053,"ANAT: This may come as a shock to you, but you've just travelled two"

1055,DOCTOR: Thank you. But I'm probably more familiar with the concept of

1058,BOAZ: You know of the Daleks? 
1059,DOCTOR: Indeed I do. I know them only too well. They've been my

1094,CONTROLLER: The fault is not mine! Your security guards let them get
1095,away. Those creatures are useless! 
1096,DALEK 2: They are loyal to the Daleks. 
1097,CONTROLLER: As loyal as they are stupid. They will never be a match for
1098,human guerillas. 
1099,DALEK 2: No one can succeed who opposes the Daleks. 
1100,"CONTROLLER: For every guerilla cell that you destroy, another one"
1101,springs up. They have stolen your time machines and copied them. They
1102,"steal your weapons, your explosives. "
1103,DALEK: These criminals will be exterminated. The Daleks will destroy

1107,DALEK: Humans are treacherous and unreliable! 
1108,CONTROLLER: Not all humans. I have served you faithfully. 
1109,DALEK: Do not dispute with the Daleks! Obey without question! 
1110,CONTROLLER: Very well. There was one curious thing. The girl referred
1111,to a companion in her own time zone. She called him the Doctor. 
1112,DALEK 2: Doctor? Did you say Doctor? 
1113,CONTROLLER: He appears to have got through to our time. He was seen by

1130,myself and supervise the search. 
1131,DALEK: Wait! You have not been dismissed. There has been a drop in
1132,recent production figures. 
1133,CONTROLLER: That can be explained. 
1134,DALEK: Explanations are irrelevant. Production targets must be
1135,maintained.

1139,"CONTROLLER: But that's impossible! If we push the workers any further,"
1140,they will die.

1154,TECHNICIAN: Yes. They'll pick him up once he's inside.

1156,separate from general analysis. I want to take a special look at them. 
1157,TECHNICIAN: Is there something wrong there? 
1158,CONTROLLER: Perhaps. I want the work figures for all the factories in

1170,"BOAZ: If you'd listened to me, we still could have done what was"
1171,needed.

1174,"MONIA: Yes, but you failed. "

1183,MONIA: No. There may be other ways. I've had a report from one of our
1184,contacts. A girl has been captured. They're holding her prisoner at the
1185,control centre. 
1186,ANAT: The same girl? The one who operated the time module at Styles'
1187,house? 
1188,MONIA: It fits your description. 
1189,"ANAT: Well, at least she's alive. "
1190,BOAZ: In the hands of the Daleks? She won't live long. 
1191,MONIA: Can she tell them anything?

1393,DOCTOR: When I meet a regime that needs to import savage alien life
1394,"forms as security guards, I begin to wonder who the real criminals are."
1395,
1396,JO: Those creatures aren't really savage. 
1397,CONTROLLER: Exactly. They are simply guard dogs. They just do what I
1398,tell them. 
1399,DOCTOR: You mean there aren't enough humans around that will follow
1400,your orders so blindly? 
1401,CONTROLLER: That is not what I was saying. 
1402,DOCTOR: Isn't it? Then what you're saying is that the entire human
1403,"population of this planet, apart from a few remarkable exceptions like"
1404,"yourself, are really only fit to lead the life of a dog. Why? "
1405,CONTROLLER: You have no right to say that! 
1406,DOCTOR: Haven't I? Who really rules this planet of yours? 
1407,"CONTROLLER: I'm sorry, I must go. I have work to do. You will excuse"
1408,me. 
1409,(The Controller leaves.) 
1410,JO: You shouldn't have spoken to him like that. You don't know the
1411,whole picture. 
1412,"DOCTOR: Neither do you, Jo. Neither do you. That man is no more than a"
1413,"superior slave himself. Humans don't rule this world any longer, Jo. "
1414,"JO: Then, who does? "
1415,"DOCTOR: The most evil, ruthless life form in the cosmos. The Daleks."

1488,DALEK 2: The Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks. How can he help us? 
1489,CONTROLLER: He has had contact with the guerillas. He has valuable
1490,information. 
1491,DALEK: You have proof of this? 
1492,CONTROLLER: I know he's working for them. The manager of one one seven
1493,"has been proved to be a subversive agent, and the Doctor was trying to"
1494,contact him when we picked him up. 
1495,DALEK 2: We will force the truth from him with the Mind Analysis
1496,machine. 
1497,CONTROLLER: But look at him! You've practically killed him just getting
1498,a simple admission of identity. He'll die before he tells you anything
1499,else. 
1500,DALEK: What is your plan? 
1501,CONTROLLER: Let me interrogate him. 
1502,DALEK: Why should you be more successful? 
1503,CONTROLLER: Because I understand human psychology. I shall be able to
1504,"gain his confidence, to put pressure on him through the girl. By the"
1505,"time I have finished with him, I shall be able to crush the guerilla"
1506,organisation entirely.

1541,"DOCTOR: My dear man, how can I tell you what I don't know myself? "
1542,CONTROLLER: But you were in contact with the guerillas? 
1543,"JO: But not from choice. Look, they were going to kill him. I know the"
1544,Doctor would help you if he could. 
1545,CONTROLLER: I am trying to help him! I've already save his life. 
1546,"DOCTOR: Yes, for your own purposes. "
1547,"CONTROLLER: Look, if you do not tell me everything that manager knew"
1548,"about these criminals, where they operate from, what their plans are,"
1549,then the Daleks will destroy both of you. 
1550,DOCTOR: I don't doubt it. 
1551,CONTROLLER: Do you value life so little? 
1552,"DOCTOR: On that contrary, I value it enormously. The Daleks will kill"
1553,us whatever we tell you. 
1554,CONTROLLER: Not if you cooperate with them. 
1555,DOCTOR: As you cooperate with them? Do you really think that makes any
1556,difference? 
1557,CONTROLLER: They can be reasonable. 
1558,DOCTOR: Reasonable? They tolerate you as long as you're useful to them.
1559,
1560,CONTROLLER: I am a senior government official. 
1561,"DOCTOR: You sir, you sir, are a traitor! You're a Quisling! "
1562,CONTROLLER: Silence! You do not understand. Nobody who did not live
1563,through those terrible years can understand. Towards the end of the
1564,"twentieth century, a series of wars broke out. There was a hundred"
1565,"years of nothing but killing, destruction. Seven eighths of the world's"
1566,"population was wiped out. The rest were living in holes in the ground,"
1567,"starving, reduced to the level of animals. "
1568,JO: So the Daleks saw their opportunity and took over. 
1569,CONTROLLER: There was no power on Earth to stop them. 
1570,"DOCTOR: So, they've turned the Earth into a giant factory, with all the"
1571,wealth and minerals were looted and taken to Skaro. 
1572,"CONTROLLER: Exactly. Men who were strong enough, of course, were sent"
1573,"down the mines, the rest work in factories. "
1574,JO: Why? Why are they doing all this? 
1575,CONTROLLER: They need a constant flow of raw materials. Their empire is
1576,expanding. 
1577,JO: How did you come to work for them? 
1578,CONTROLLER: They chose a few humans to help them get things going
1579,"again, to organise the remaining population. My family have been"
1580,controllers in this area for three generations. 
1581,"DOCTOR: A family of Quisling's, eh? "
1582,CONTROLLER: We have helped make things better for the others. We have
1583,gained concessions. I have saved lives! 
1584,DOCTOR: Wouldn't you have helped more by organising the fight against
1585,them? 
1586,CONTROLLER: No one can fight against the Daleks. 
1587,"DOCTOR: That's not what your criminal guerillas seem to think, is it. "
1588,CONTROLLER: A handful of fanatics. Most of them have been killed
1589,already. I assure you there is nothing they can do to change things.

1632,somewhere. Extend the radius of the search. 
1633,"YATES: I'll need some more men, sir. "

1639,
1640, [Rebel base]
1641,
1642, JO: But how do you know this? 
1643,"MONIA: Oh, there are books. Even during the wars, people found time to"
1644,"study, to write about it. "
1645,"ANAT: What to you has not yet happened, is to us history. "
1646,"DOCTOR: This history of yours, it talks about Sir Reginald Styles? "
1647,"MONIA: Oh yeah. He pretended to be working for peace, but really he"
1648,just wanted power for himself. 
1649,DOCTOR: So the conference he called was just a trick? 
1650,"MONIA: He managed to lure the world leaders to a remote country house,"
1651,and he pretended they needed absolute quiet if the meeting was to
1652,"succeed. But then, there was a devastating explosion. "
1653,ANAT: And Styles was killed with the others. He must have set a bomb
1654,and mis-timed the charge. 
1655,"MONIA: There were accusations, counter-accusations, and then the wars"
1656,began. That was the turning point. 
1657,"JO: But if this true, Sir Reginald Styles must be completely round the"
1658,bend. 
1659,"DOCTOR: So, you went back into our time to kill Styles before he could"
1660,carry out his plan. 
1661,"MONIA: Right. We'd been fighting the Daleks for years, but it was"
1662,"hopeless. Eventually we must lose, so we thought, what else can we do? "
1663,ANAT: We learnt through one of our spies that the Daleks had succeeded
1664,in creating a time machine. We even managed to steal a copy of the
1665,"plans, and we built one of our own, so that we could go back into"
1666,history to the exact point where things started to go wrong. 
1667,"MONIA: With one action, we could them. Mankind could have a chance to"
1668,take a new direction. 
1669,"ANAT: But even now, the transfer isn't always stable. People"
1670,materialised in your time and then just faded away. 
1671,JO: The ghost that Styles saw? 
1672,"MONIA: Now, somehow the Daleks found what we were doing, and they sent"
1673,Ogrons back into your time after us and attacked one of our men. 
1674,"DOCTOR: Well, that must have been the man that we saw down by the canal"
1675,"tunnel. You remember, Jo, the one who vanished from the ambulance? "
1676,"ANAT: Yes, we fixed on the tunnel as a place that was stable in your"
1677,"time and in ours. We used it as a transfer point. Well, you know the"
1678,rest. 
1679,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, there's one thing I don't quite understand and that"
1680,"is why were you so keen to rescue us? Well believe me, we're grateful,"
1681,but 
1682,"MONIA: Well, you told us yourself. You're an old enemy of the Daleks. "
1683,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1684,MONIA: Then you will help us to beat them. 
1685,DOCTOR: What do you expect me to do? 
1686,"MONIA: Well, you can succeed where we've failed, Doctor. We want you to"
1687,go back into your own time and kill Styles. 
1688,"(The injured Shura is still in the twentieth century, skirting around"
1689,the cordon of steel the Brigadier has thrown up around Auderly House
1690,until he gets to an outbuilding and goes inside.) 
1691,DOCTOR: You're asking me to commit murder! 
1692,ANAT: No! We're asking you to kill one man and prevent millions more
1693,dying. 
1694,DOCTOR: That is still murder. 
1695,MONIA: Isn't it worth it to save the human race from the Daleks? 
1696,"DOCTOR: Yes, but would it? "
1697,ANAT: We've told you how it happened. 
1698,"DOCTOR: But your history could be wrong, you know? Now listen, why"
1699,don't you send us back to our time? We know the future now. Maybe there
1700,are other things we can do? 
1701,"ANAT: Monia, we're wasting valuable time. Every minute that goes by "
1702,"MONIA: Doctor, will you help us? It's our only hope. "
1703,JO: I still can't believe that Sir Reginald Styles is a ruthless
1704,murderer. 
1705,"DOCTOR: Yes, I agree, Jo. Vain to the point of arrogance, a trifle"
1706,"obstinate, perhaps, but basically a good man. So, if it happened, how"
1707,did it happen? Any of your people still in our time zone? 
1708,MONIA: No. 
1709,"ANAT: Oh, Shura. He left just to send a message and we never saw nor"
1710,heard from him again. We assumed he must be dead. 
1711,(Shura has somehow made his way to the wine cellar under the main house
1712,with the globe device that was hidden by the tunnel in episode two. He
1713,primes the device and starts it up.) 
1714,"MONIA: Look, why are you so interested in Shura? "
1715,"DOCTOR: I'm curious, that's all. "
1716,"ANAT: Curious? Well, that's funny. Mark and Boaz got killed to save you"
1717,and you're curious. 
1718,MONIA: Anat! 
1719,"DOCTOR: Look, please believe me, I'm completely with you about the"
1720,ends. I only disagree as to the means. 
1721,MONIA: All right. What do you want to know? 
1722,DOCTOR: This mission of yours to the twentieth century. What did you
1723,take with you? 
1724,"ANAT: The usual battle gear. Radio, disintegrators. "
1725,DOCTOR: Any sabotage equipment? 
1726,ANAT: Only a few charges of Dalekanium. 
1727,DOCTOR: Dalekanium? 
1728,ANAT: It's a highly effective type of explosive. We stole the formula
1729,from the Daleks. 
1730,DOCTOR: Could it destroy a house? 
1731,"MONIA: What are you trying to say, Doctor? "
1732,"DOCTOR: Well, don't you see? This has happened before. "
1733,ANAT: What has? 
1734,"DOCTOR: You went back to change history, but you didn't change"
1735,anything. You became a part of it. 
1736,MONIA: What are you talking about? 
1737,"DOCTOR: If Styles didn't cause that explosion, somebody else did. "
1738,"ANAT: Well, obviously, but who? Shura! "
1739,DOCTOR: Isn't that exactly what he would have done? One last suicidal
1740,attempt to carry out his orders? 
1741,"MONIA: It's possible, I suppose. "
1742,DOCTOR: You're trapped in a temporal paradox! Styles didn't cause that
1743,explosion and start the wars. You did it yourselves.

1824, (The twenty four hour media have arrived outside
1825,the house and started broadcasting.) 
1826,MACINTOSH: Here in the peaceful heart of England will soon take place
1827,what could be described as the most important summit conference of this
1828,century. The peaceful atmosphere of this Georgian house gives little
1829,"indication of the underlying tension of the occasion. A desperate, last"
1830,minute attempt to stem the rising tide of international tension that
1831,seems to be moving the great powers towards the brink of a third world
1832,"war. Arriving now is Sir Reginald Styles, who with his team of"
1833,"government aides, has been working around the clock to make this"
1834,"meeting possible. Sir Reginald himself, has just returned from an"
1835,eleventh hour meeting in Peking where his success in persuading the
1836,Chinese leaders to reconsider their walk out gave the first real chance
1837,"of success to these talks. Talks, on which may well depend, the fate of"
1838,the entire world. 
1839,(Various nationalities get out of cars and go into the house.)
1840,
1841, [Hallway]
1842,
1843," STYLES: Everything set up, Brigadier? "
1844,"BRIGADIER: Yes, sir. Although I still feel "
1845,STYLES: We won't waste time on the formalities. We'll just get on with
1846,the business as soon as possible. 
1847,(The Doctor and Jo drive up to the house and run inside. The guards
1848,snap to attention for the Doctor.) 
1849,"STYLES: Look, you're supposed to be in charge of security. Kindly get"
1850,on with your job and leave me to get on with mine. 
1851,"DOCTOR: Brigadier! Brigadier, get everybody out of this house at once. "
1852,BRIGADIER: Where the devil have you been? 
1853,"DOCTOR: Never mind all that, just clear this house immediately. "
1854,STYLES: What's the man talking about? 
1855,"JO: Do as he says! Look, there isn't much time! "
1856,(Ogrons and the Daleks come out of the tunnel under the railway bridge
1857,"and go along the towpath, where they make quick work of the UNIT"
1858,soldiers there.) 
1859,"DOCTOR: Look, try and use your intelligence, man, even if you are a"
1860,politician. 
1861,"STYLES: Brigadier, if you can't get this lunatic out of my way "
1862,"BRIGADIER: I know it all sounds incredible, sir, but the Doctor usually"
1863,knows what he's talking about. 
1864,STYLES: Arranging this conference was an almost impossible task. It is
1865,no exaggeration to say that the peace of the world depends on its
1866,success. I will not jeopardise that success now! 
1867,"DOCTOR: Brigadier, get this man and all the delegates out of this area"
1868,"immediately. Use force if you have to! Jo, you stay here. "
1869,(The Doctor leaves.) 
1870,"BRIGADIER: Sir Reginald, please? "
1871,"STYLES: No, I will not permit it!"
1872,
1873, [Cellar]
1874,
1875, DOCTOR: Shura! 
1876,SHURA: Get out of here unless you want to die too. I must kill Styles
1877,to prevent the war. 
1878,"DOCTOR: Shura, listen to me. Styles and all the delegates are already"
1879,leaving this house. You detonate that bomb and you'll be sacrificing
1880,yourself for nothing.
1881,
1882, [Railway bridge]
1883,
1884, BENTON: Benton calling UNIT HQ. Benton calling
1885,"UNIT HQ. We just can't hold them, sir!"
1886,
1887, [Hallway]
1888,
1889,(Gunfire can be heard outside.) 
1890,"YATES: Look, Benton, keep them back as long as you can. "
1891,"BRIGADIER: Sir Reginald, this house is under attack by a hostile force."
1892,You will please consider yourself under my orders. 
1893,"STYLES: Brigadier, I'm warn you "
1894,"BRIGADIER: Now be quiet, sir! Captain Yates. "
1895,YATES: Sir. 
1896,BRIGADIER: Get Sir Reginald and all the delegates away from this area
1897,at once. Use the front exit. 
1898,STYLES: I absolutely refuse! 
1899,"YATES: Sir Reginald, please. "
1900,"STYLES: But my papers, the documents. "
1901,"AIDE: They're all here, sir. "
1902,"STYLES: Well, I suppose I shall have to agree, but under protest! "
1903,"YATES: This way, Sir Reginald. "
1904,"(Jo goes into the study. Outside, UNIT troops are falling back under"
1905,the alien onslaught. Mortars prove to be more effective weapons than
1906,gunfire. Out the front the delegates return to their cars and drive
1907,"away, the Russians first, closely followed by the USA. The Daleks have"
1908,"made it to the terrace, and one enters the French windows.)"
1909,
1910, [Cellar]
1911,
1912," JO: Doctor! The Daleks, they're coming into the"
1913,house! 
1914,SHURA: Daleks? You're lying! 
1915,"DOCTOR: No, she's not. They've come back to make sure that their"
1916,version of history isn't changed. Is everybody out of the house? 
1917,"JO: Yes, everyone but us. "
1918,SHURA: Get out of here. Let them come in! Leave them to me! 
1919,"JO: No, no! You must come with us! "
1920,SHURA: You don't understand! That's Dalekanium. It's the only thing
1921,that's effective against the Daleks. 
1922,DOCTOR: Couldn't we set a time fuse? 
1923,SHURA: This stuff's too unstable. There just isn't time. This is
1924,something that I must do myself. Now get out! 
1925,DOCTOR: Very well. 
1926,SHURA: Out!
1927,
1928, [Outside Auderly House]
1929,
1930, BRIGADIER: Greyhound to Trap One. Greyhound to
1931,Trap One. Do you read me? Over. Greyhound to 
1932,DOCTOR: Tell your men to fall back. Let the Daleks into the house. 
1933,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, are you sure that "
1934,DOCTOR: It may not make military sense but it's the only way. 
1935,BRIGADIER: All right. Brigadier to all units. Let them pass! I say
1936,"again, let them pass! Re-group on the main road. Out!"
1937,
1938, [Hallway]
1939,
1940, DALEK 3: Where are the delegates? 
1941,DALEK 2: Where is the man Styles? 
1942,DALEK 3: They must be found and exterminated.
1943,
1944, [Cellar]
1945,
1946," SHURA: Oh no, not this time. This time it's going"
1947,to be different. 
1948,(Shura triggers the bomb.)

1951,
1952," (The house goes KaBOOM, leaving just a big cloud"
1953,of debris and a few walls.) 
1954,STYLES: What happened? 
1955,"DOCTOR: Your conference has been saved, Sir Reginald. Now it's up to"
1956,you and your friends to make sure it's a success. You still have a
1957,choice. 
1958,STYLES: Don't worry. We all know what will happen if we fail. 
1959,"DOCTOR: So do we. We've seen it happen, haven't we, Jo?  "
