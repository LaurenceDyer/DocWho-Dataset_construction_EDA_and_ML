23," (On a planet far, far away, three men look at a"
24,planet on a large wall monitor with a thick golden frame.) 
25,TIME LORD: Are you are sure the Master knows? 
26,TIME LORD 2: The report on the Doomsday weapon is missing from our
27,files. Only he could have taken it. 
28,TIME LORD: Then we can use the Doctor to deal with this problem. 
29,TIME LORD 3: The Doctor resents his exile bitterly. Do you think he'll
30,co-operate with us? 
31,"TIME LORD 2: I doubt it. We immobilised his Tardis, took away his"
32,freedom to move in space and time. 
33,TIME LORD: Then we must restore his freedom for as long as it serves
34,our purpose.

38, (The Doctor is still trying to repair the
39,dematerialization circuit.) 
40,"JO: Doctor, why don't you give up? You've been working on that thing"
41,for simply ages. 
42,"DOCTOR: You know I can't give up, Jo. It's far too important. "
43,"BRIGADIER: Still at it, Doctor? "
44,DOCTOR: Now don't you start. 
45,BRIGADIER: The latest field reports are in. Still no trace of the
46,Master. 
47,"DOCTOR: Well, I didn't expect there would be. No, his Tardis is working"
48,again now. He could be anywhere in space and time. 
49,"BRIGADIER: Yes, that's as maybe, Doctor, but I've got to keep on"
50,looking. 
51,"DOCTOR: You're wasting your time, Brigadier. "
52,(The telephone rings.) 
53,"JO: Hello, Laboratory? Yes, he's here. Brigadier? "
54,"BRIGADIER: Oh, thank you. Lethbridge Stewart? Right. Send him into my"
55,office. One of my agents thinks he's picked up a trace of the Master. 
56,DOCTOR: Your agents are always picking up traces of the Master. 
57,"BRIGADIER: This agent happens to be particularly reliable, Doctor. I'll"
58,let you what he says. If you're interested. 
59,(The Brigadier leaves.) 
60,JO: Ah. Now you've offended him. 
61,"DOCTOR: Well, look what happened last time. The man they arrested"
62,"turned out to be the Spanish ambassador. Well, there you are. That's"
63,done it. 
64,JO: Done what? 
65,DOCTOR: I've made myself a completely new dematerialization circuit.
66,One that'll bypass the Time Lords homing control. I hope. 
67,"JO: You don't seriously think you'll get that thing working again, do"
68,you? 
69,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. No, I've been doing all this work for fun. "
70,JO: I mean it's just a sort of hobby isn't it? A kind of game? 
71,DOCTOR: A game? 
72,"JO: Well, what have you got in there anyway. A policeman? "
73,DOCTOR: Why not step inside and see for yourself?
74,
75, [Tardis]
76,
77, JO: I don't believe it! It's bigger inside than
78,out! 
79,DOCTOR: Yes. That's because the Tardis is dimensionally transcendental.
80,
81,JO: What does that mean? 
82,DOCTOR: It means that it's bigger inside than out. Now then. 
83,(The Doctor inserts the dematerialization circuit while the Tardis
84,doors close. Then the time rotor starts going up and down.) 
85,DOCTOR: That's impossible! 
86,JO: The doors have closed. 
87,DOCTOR: What? 
88,"JO: Doctor, let me out of here. "
89,"DOCTOR: Well, I can't, Jo. I think we're taking off! "
90,"JO: Well, stop it. "
91,DOCTOR: I'm trying to. Something's operating it by remote control. 
92,(The Tardis dematerialises.) 
93,DOCTOR: The Time Lords!
94,
95, [UNIT Laboratory]
96,
97, (The Brigadier enters.) 
98,"BRIGADIER: I'm afraid you were right, Doctor. Another dead end and we "
99,(The Tardis disappears.) 
100,BRIGADIER: Doctor? Come back at once.
101,
102, [Tardis]
103,
104," JO: All right, Doctor. The joke's over. Open the"
105,doors and let me out. 
106,"DOCTOR: I can't, Jo. We've taken off. "
107,"JO: All right, then. Where are we? "
108,DOCTOR: At the moment we're nowhere. 
109,"JO: Oh, don't be silly. We can't be nowhere. "
110,DOCTOR: We're outside the space time continuum. 
111,JO: What? 
112,(The Doctor turns on a scanner.) 
113,DOCTOR: Look. 
114,JO: What's happening? Where are we going? 
115,DOCTOR: I've no idea. We'll just have to wait until we emerge. 
116,(The psychadelia on the scanner is replaced by a planet.) 
117,DOCTOR: The planet Uxarieus. So that's our destination. 
118,"JO: Very impressive, but can we go back to Earth now please? "
119,"DOCTOR: I don't know, Jo. I just don't know. "
120,"(On the planet, a large tank-like robot travels along, stopping"
121,occasionally to survey the ground with a device on the end of an arm on
122,its rotating turret. It moves on and the Tardis materialises. Welcome
123,to an old Cornish china clay pit before they finished working it and
124,started turning it back into woodland.) 
125,JO: Is that supposed to be where we are? 
126,DOCTOR: That is where we are. 
127,"JO: All right then. If we've landed on another planet, why don't you"
128,open the doors? 
129,"DOCTOR: Because the atmosphere out there might be poisonous, that's"
130,why. I'll just check. 
131,"JO: Well, is it? "
132,DOCTOR: Is it what? 
133,JO: Is the atmosphere poisonous? 
134,"DOCTOR: No. No, it's quite healthy. Similar to Earth before the"
135,invention of the motor car. 
136,"JO: Look, Doctor, are you going to open the doors or not? "
137,DOCTOR: I can but try. 
138,(The Doctor succeeds.) 
139,JO: Thank you. (looks outside) Doctor! 
140,"DOCTOR: That's an alien world out there, Jo. Think of it. "
141,JO: I don't want to think of it. I want to go back to Earth. 
142,"DOCTOR: Look, do you realize how long I've been confined to one planet?"
143,
144,"JO: All that talk of yours about travelling in time and space, it was"
145,true. 
146,"DOCTOR: Well, of course it was true! Before I was stranded on Earth, I"
147,spent all my time exploring new worlds and seeking the wonders of the
148,universe. 
149,JO: But you don't know what's out there. 
150,DOCTOR: Then let's find out. Don't you want to set foot in another
151,world? 
152,"JO: Well, yes, I do but I "
153,"DOCTOR: Good. Come on. We'll just take a quick look around, and then"
154,I'll try and get you back to Earth. All right? 
155,JO: All right.
156,
157, [Uxarieus]
158,
159, JO: Look. 
160,(Jo picks up an alien flower.) 
161,JO: It's got different kinds of petals. 
162,(The Doctor goes to look at something else and Jo follows. We see that
163,they are being watched by a green figure carrying a spear.) 
164,JO: What are they? 
165,DOCTOR: They're tracks made by some sort of machine. This planet must
166,be inhabited after all. I think we'll get a better view from up there.
167,"Come on, what are you waiting for? "
168,JO: I feel a bit scared. 
169,"DOCTOR: Come on, Jo. Nothing to worry about. "
170,"(As they walk up the slope, the figure goes over to the Tardis.) "
171,JO: Those things up there. 
172,"DOCTOR: They look like some sort of prefabricated dwellings. Oh look,"
173,there's another one. A small one up there. Let's go and take a look at
174,them. 
175,"JO: Oh no, you don't. Let's get back to the Tardis. "
176,"DOCTOR: Yes, all right. But, er, do you mind if I take a look at that"
177,rock first? It's rather unusual. 
178,"(They bend down to examine the rock, and Jo looks over her shoulder.) "
179,JO: Doctor? Doctor? 
180,(A man is pointing a shotgun at them.)
181,
182, [Ashe's office]
183,
184," MARTIN: (man with grey beard) Listen, Ashe, I saw"
185,those creatures. We both did. 
186,ASHE: (dark hair) I surveyed this planet myself before the colony was
187,set up. 
188,"MARTIN: Well, you didn't do much of a job. "
189,"ASHE: And all the time we've been here, there's been no trace of any"
190,hostile animal life. 
191,"MARTIN: Well, there is now. "
192,MRS MARTIN: We heard this roaring in the middle of the night. When we
193,"looked out, there it was. "
194,WINTON: (moustache only) What did it look like? 
195,MARTIN: It was enormous. Some kind of giant lizard. 
196,ASHE: You must have been having nightmares. 
197,WINTON: Did it do any damage? 
198,"MARTIN: No, I fired a few shots and frightened it off. "
199,"ASHE: Well, exactly. All right, Martin. David, how many men have you"
200,got to spare? 
201,WINTON: About six. 
202,"ASHE: Well, go over to Martin's dome and have a look, just in case. "
203,WINTON: Very well.
204,
205, [Dome entry area]
206,
207, (A large open and mostly empty area with a
208,staircase to the right of the main door and what looks like furniture
209,stored to the left. Ashe enters from his office opposite the doorway.
210,The Doctor and Jo are brought in at gunpoint by Leeson and his wife
211,Jane.) 
212,"ASHE: What the? Leeson, who's this? "
213,"DOCTOR: How do you do? Well, I must say this is all most impressive. "
214,LEESON: We found these two in sector twenty seven. They say they're
215,explorers. 
216,ASHE: Where do they come from? 
217,DOCTOR: We come from Earth. 
218,LEESON: They were examining rock samples. They're mineralogists. It was
219,bound to happen. 
220,"DOCTOR: Look, we are not mineralogists. And even if we were, why all"
221,the hostility? It's a respectable profession. 
222,LEESON: Because we don't want our planet gutted. This is our world.
223,You've no right to be here. 
224,"DOCTOR: Look, we've as much right to be here as anybody else. "
225,ASHE: This planet has been classified as suitable for colonisation.
226,"Once your big mining combines move in, you'll reduce it to a galactic"
227,slagheap. 
228,DOCTOR: Haven't you got laws to deal with this kind of thing? 
229,"LEESON: Yes, there are laws. We can complain to Earth's government just"
230,"like all the others. By the time you'll get a final decision, the"
231,planet's useless. 
232,"DOCTOR: I see. Yes well, I can sympathize with you, gentlemen, but I"
233,can assure you that I'm not working for anybody. 
234,ASHE: Then just why have you come here? 
235,DOCTOR: Pure chance. My spaceship developed a fault. I had to land
236,somewhere. 
237,ASHE: Can you show me your papers? 
238,"DOCTOR: Papers? No, they're back in my spaceship. If you'd like to come"
239,"back there with me, I "
240,ASHE: I think it would be better if you spent the night here. We'll go
241,to your spaceship in the morning. 
242,"JO: Oh, we don't want to put you to any trouble. "
243,ASHE: I'd rather you did as I say. Jane? 
244,"JANE: Yes, John? "
245,ASHE: Show our two guests to the dining area. We'll fix up your
246,sleeping accommodation later. 
247,"DOCTOR: Yes, go with them. It's all right, Jo. I'll join you in a"
248,moment. 
249,JO: All right. 
250,JANE: This way. 
251,(Jane and Jo leave. The Doctor is looking at a graph on the wall.) 
252,LEESON: What do you think you're up to! 
253,(Leeson rushes over to the Doctor with his rifle ready. The Doctor uses
254,his Venusian karate move to stop him and make him drop the weapon.) 
255,"DOCTOR: These are your crop records, I take it? "
256,"ASHE: That's right, but I really don't see what it has to do with you. "
257,"DOCTOR: It's a very poor showing, isn't it? Are you operating above"
258,subsistence level? 
259,LEESON: We're surviving. Come on! 
260,"ASHE: No, no, just a minute. I'd like to hear what he has to say. "
261,"DOCTOR: Unless I'm very much mistaken, you've got far more to worry"
262,about than mineralogists. 
263,ASHE: Just what do you mean by that? 
264,"DOCTOR: Unless things improve radically, you're in grave danger of"
265,starving to death. 
266,"(Outside, the Tardis is pushed over onto its side and hauled away by"
267,four aliens.)
268,
269, [Communal mess hall]
270,
271," MARTIN: I don't care what Ashe says. You saw it,"
272,didn't you? 
273,MRS MARTIN: I'm sure Ashe believes you. 
274,(Jane and Jo enter.) 
275,JANE: You can sit where you like. 
276,MARTIN: He thinks we're seeing things. You two had better watch out. It
277,could be you next. 
278,MRS MARTIN: Ashe will take care of things. 
279,(Jane ladles out some soup from a large pan on the stove.) 
280,JO: Is that the first course? 
281,JANE: It's the only course. Supplies are getting a bit low. 
282,MRS MARTIN: Things are bound to be difficult. 
283,JO: It's very nice. Thank you. 
284,JANE: I'd better get back to my husband. 
285,MARTIN: It's getting harder all the time. 
286,MRS MARTIN: At least it's better than being back on Earth. 
287,"MARTIN: Oh, I don't know. Things weren't so bad there. "
288,"MRS MARTIN: Weren't they? No room to move, polluted air, not a blade of"
289,grass left on the planet and a government that locks you up if you
290,think for yourself. 
291,MARTIN: At least they fed you. This isn't exactly the Garden of Eden.
292,And Ashe said we could make it perfect. 
293,(Winton enters.) 
294,"WINTON: Are you ready, Martin? We're going to look for your monsters."
295,Let's hope we find something. 
296,MARTIN: You may be sorry if you do. 
297,WINTON: We can skin it and you can use it for a rug. 
298,(The Martins leave with Winton. A young woman with long hair enters and
299,gets herself a bowl of soup. She sits next to Jo.) 
300,MARY: Hello. 
301,JO: Hello. 
302,MARY: I'm Mary Ashe. My father told me about you. 
303,JO: Jo Grant. How do you do? 
304,MARY: Is that what they're wearing on Earth now? 
305,JO: More or less. 
306,MARY: It was all quite different when we left back in '71. 
307,JO: You left in 1971? 
308,"MARY: No, 2471."
309,
310, [Leeson's dome] 
311, (Jane tears off the calendar page for Mon 2 March
312,"2472, then pulls the wooden bed down from the wall. Leeson enters.) "
313,LEESON: I've been checking the northern sector. 
314,JANE: How's it going? 
315,LEESON: It isn't. These cover crops won't even start to grow. 
316,JANE: What about the other sectors? 
317,LEESON: Huh! It's even worse. 
318,"JANE: Never mind, my dear. "
319,LEESON: We should never have come here. 
320,"JANE: We didn't even have a room of our own on Earth. Now, we've got"
321,land. 
322,"(Jane takes two cups out of a replicator or microwave, whatever.) "
323,LEESON: What's the point of owning land if it won't grow a decent crop?
324,
325,JANE: Ashe is working on it. 
326,"LEESON: Ashe knows we're beaten. He just won't admit it. Anyway, it"
327,probably doesn't matter anymore. 
328,JANE: What do you mean? 
329,LEESON: Those people that I found this morning. Suppose they are spies
330,for one of the big mining combines. 
331,JANE: Ashe seemed to believe what they say. 
332,"(Outside, a faint roar carries above the constant howl of the wind.) "
333,JANE: What was that? 
334,LEESON: I don't know. It must have been the wind. 
335,"JANE: Even if the mining combines do come, they can't drive us out. We"
336,were here first. 
337,LEESON: Can't they? It's happened before. 
338,(Another roar. Leeson goes to look outside. An iguana with a head the
339,size of a man is outside.) 
340,LEESON: Get on the radio! 
341,(Leeson loads his shotgun.) 
342,JANE: Don't go out there. 
343,LEESON: Maybe I can drive it off. 
344,JANE: Hello? Main dome. Can you hear me? 
345,(Gunshot.) 
346,JANE: Can you hear me? 
347,MARY : This is main dome. Please identify. 
348,JANE: This is Jane Leeson. Our dome is being attacked. Some kind of
349,"giant reptile! Please, you must send help! "
350,"(More shots, and the attacker roars. Jane turns to someone who has come"
351,in. We don't see them.) 
352,JANE: Who are you? What do you want? 
353,(She tries to reach for a weapon but the person advances on her.) 
354,JANE: Go away! Go away!
355,
356, [Ashe's office] 
357, DOCTOR: Let's see if I've got this right. You
358,brought your colonists to this planet just over a year ago. 
359,ASHE: Yes. 
360,"DOCTOR: You set up your main dome here, with all your subsidiary domes"
361,around it. 
362,ASHE: That's right. I made a preliminary survey before I sent for the
363,others. 
364,DOCTOR: And you were convinced that this planet was suitable for
365,"habitation, despite the exhaustion of the soil? "
366,"ASHE: Well, worn out soil can be reclaimed, Doctor, as you well know."
367,We should have had subsidence crops within the year. 
368,DOCTOR: Exactly. Should have. 
369,"ASHE: The cover crop refuses to grow. We plant it, it shoots up and"
370,"then withers, again and again. There seems to be no reason for it. "
371,"DOCTOR: Well, in theory, you should have a bumper crop by now. "
372,"ASHE: I can't feed my people on theories, Doctor. "
373,"DOCTOR: No, no, of course not. Well, in practical terms, what you must"
374,do is this 
375,(Mary and Jo enter.) 
376,MARY: Jane Leeson's just radioed in! 
377,"ASHE: Well, can't it wait? I'm very busy. "
378,MARY: She say's their dome's being attacked! 
379,ASHE: Attacked? 
380,MARY: By some kind of giant reptile! 
381,JO: I heard her too. She sounded terrified. 
382,MARY: The radio cut out while she was still talking. 
383,DOCTOR: Didn't you say you'd sent some men down there? 
384,"ASHE: Yes, but to Martin's dome at the other end of the colony. Look,"
385,get in touch with Winton. Tell him to get over to Leeson's dome as fast
386,as he can. I'll join him there. 
387,"DOCTOR: I'll come with you, if I may. "
388,"ASHE: Well, there's no need for you to get involved, Doctor. "
389,"DOCTOR: Scientific curiosity, my dear chap. I find your planet most"
390,intriguing. 
391,"ASHE: Very well, thank you. "
392,JO: Doctor
393,
394, [Dome entry area] 
395," JO: Doctor, I don't think you should go. It might"
396,be dangerous. 
397,"DOCTOR: Jo, don't worry about me. I'll be careful. Now go and get some"
398,sleep. 
399,JO: Sleep! How do you expect me to? Doctor! 
400,"MARY: Leeson's dome. I repeat, Leeson's dome. Do you read me? "
401,WINTON : I read you. We're on our way. 
402,MARY: Be careful. 
403,JO: How long did you say you'd been on this planet? 
404,MARY: Just over a year. 
405,JO: And you found no sign of these creatures then? 
406,"MARY: There's no animal life, just a few birds and insects. "
407,"JO: Well, there is now."
408,
409, [Leeson's dome] 
410, (A covered body is carried away on a stretcher.
411,The place has been trashed.) 
412,"WINTON: Robert, there's nothing you could have done. They were both"
413,dead when we got here. 
414,ASHE: Did you see the creatures? 
415,WINTON: We caught a glimpse of one as we arrived. Everyone blazed away
416,like mad. 
417,DOCTOR: And what happened? 
418,WINTON: Nothing. It didn't even seem to notice. 
419,ASHE: You must have missed. 
420,"WINTON: What, all of us? We tried to get in closer but it just"
421,disappeared. Vanished into the darkness. 
422,ASHE: It'll be daylight soon. Perhaps we shall be able to pick up some
423,tracks or bloodstains. 
424,"DOCTOR: I doubt it. Come and take a look at these claw marks,"
425,gentlemen. 
426,"ASHE: Well, what about them? "
427,"DOCTOR: Are you trying to tell me these were made by a giant lizard,"
428,Winton? 
429,WINTON: Yes. It must have been a least twenty foot high. 
430,DOCTOR: Twenty foot high? 
431,WINTON: Yes. 
432,DOCTOR: Then will you kindly tell me how a creature twenty feet high
433,came through that door?
434,
435, [Dome entry area]
436,
437,(A group of colonists have gathered.) 
438,"MARTIN: Why can't you admit defeat, Ashe? We've got to get back to"
439,Earth. 
440,"ASHE: If we go back to Earth, we'll be worse off than we were before."
441,All our savings have gone into this. 
442,"WINTON: Then we must move on to another planet. If we stay here, we'll"
443,be dead. 
444,ASHE: I'm not sure that we can move on. Our spaceship was old when we
445,bought it. It may not survive another trip. 
446,"WINTON: Oh, Robert, why won't you admit your mistakes? "
447,ASHE: We've invested a year of our lives in this place. We've got the
448,beginnings of a colony. 
449,WINTON: Our food stocks are getting lower all the time. We can't even
450,support ourselves. 
451,"ASHE: All right, we've got problems, but they can be overcome. "
452,DOCTOR: Ashe is perfectly right. There is no reason why this planet
453,should not support a thriving colony. 
454,MARTIN: I suppose you're an expert in agriculture? 
455,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, as a matter of fact, I am. "
456,MARTIN: Then why won't my crops grow? 
457,DOCTOR: Because they are being inhibited by some unnatural force. We
458,must track it down and overcome it. 
459,"MARTIN: But two people have been killed, or have you forgotten that? "
460,ASHE: Killed by creatures that vanish without trace? 
461,"WINTON: Look, we saw something! "
462,DOCTOR: Whatever it was you saw can be destroyed. 
463,"ASHE: This colony is our only hope. If we leave, we'll have nothing. If"
464,"we stay, we may have a future. "
465,WINTON: Why won't you 
466,MRS MARTIN: He's right. We've put too much work into this place to
467,leave. 
468,MARTIN: What if these animals attack again? 
469,MRS MARTIN: We fight back. 
470,"ASHE: Good! Now, what about the rest of you? Are you willing to give it"
471,another try? 
472,"MARTIN: Well, if there really is a chance. "
473,"ASHE: There is if we stick together. Now, what we've got to do is to"
474,organise patrols for the domes. The Doctor here will help us with 
475,"WINTON: Robert, wait! "
476,(Mary is helping an injured man into the dome.) 
477,MARY: One of the patrols found him wandering in the south sector. 
478,"ASHE: Get some water, somebody, quickly. Where are you from? Can you"
479,understand what I say? 
480,"DOCTOR: It's all right, old chap, You're amongst friends now. "
481,(The man takes a sip of water.) 
482,ASHE: Who are you? Where did you come from? 
483,NORTON: Colony. Come from colony. 
484,ASHE: What colony? 
485,NORTON: Long way from here. 
486,WINTON: You mean there's another colony on this planet? 
487,NORTON: I've been wandering long time. Months. 
488,"WINTON: These other colonists. Well, where are they? "
489,NORTON: Dead. All dead. Giant lizards! 
490,DOCTOR: Lizards? 
491,NORTON: Came from nowhere. Killed everything. I'm the only one left.

494,
495, (Two of the green aliens are looking at items in
496,"the dome, including a book and the radio microphone.) "
497,"ASHE : I hope you find what you're looking for, Doctor. "
498,DOCTOR: I only hope you're right. 
499,"(As the Doctor enters, one alien raises a knife.) "
500,"ASHE: No! No, he is a friend. These are ours. You must leave them. "
501,(The aliens put the items back.) 
502,DOCTOR: Do they have a language of their own? 
503,ASHE: I've never heard them speak but they seem to understand what I
504,say. 
505,DOCTOR: Extraordinary. Must be some rudimentary telepathic ability. Are
506,they friendly? 
507,ASHE: Depends on how you treat them. We had two colonists killed when
508,we first moved here. You must go now. 
509,(The aliens leave.) 
510,"ASHE: Just what are you looking for, Doctor? "
511,DOCTOR: I've no idea. Possibly some evidence to convince your colonists
512,to stay. 
513,"ASHE: Yes, I thought I'd won them over until that man turned up. Now I"
514,don't know how long I can hold them. 
515,DOCTOR: Just play for time. 
516,"ASHE: Yes. Well, I'd better get back there to see what's happening. Can"
517,you find your own way back? 
518,"DOCTOR: Yes. Oh, yes, of course. "
519,"ASHE: Right, I'll leave you to it then and, be careful. "
520,(Ashe leaves. The Doctor scraps samples from the claw marks in the
521,"broken table and puts them in a vial. He turns to see a robot entering,"
522,two large arms flailing up and down. It has the logo IMC on the front.)

527,
528, (The robot is followed by a man in a black and red
529,"uniform, and red metal helmet. He controls it via a remote control. The"
530,robot stops.) 
531,CALDWELL: Right. You can get up now. 
532,"DOCTOR: Thank you very much. You know, you really ought to keep this"
533,thing of yours under better control. 
534,"CALDWELL: (Smiles.) Yeah, I'm sorry. He's only a mark three"
535,servo-robot. He's not very bright. What happened in here? 
536,"DOCTOR: Well, I only wish I knew. Something attacked this place late"
537,last night. 
538,CALDWELL: Is it your place? 
539,"DOCTOR: No. No, it belonged to two colonists. "
540,"CALDWELL: Colonists? According to Earth Control, this planet hasn't"
541,been colonised. 
542,"DOCTOR: It appears they were wrong, doesn't it. May I ask what you're"
543,doing here? 
544,CALDWELL: IMC. Interplanetary Mining Corporation. We're doing a mineral
545,survey. 
546,DOCTOR: How long have you been here? 
547,"CALDWELL: We've just arrived. Colonists, eh? Well, now we've got"
548,trouble. 
549,DOCTOR: Why? Presumably you'll be moving to another planet. 
550,"CALDWELL: Well, it isn't up to me. They'll have to sort that out at"
551,Earth Control. What are you up to? 
552,DOCTOR: I'm just making a few tests. 
553,CALDWELL: Are you some kind of scientist? 
554,"DOCTOR: I'm every kind of scientist. Now, if you'll excuse me. "
555,"CALDWELL: Look, I'm on my way back to my spaceship. How about you"
556,coming back with me? 
557,"DOCTOR: Well, I'd like to, but I haven't really got the time. In any"
558,"case, I ought to get back and tell the colonists that you've arrived. "
559,"(Caldwell operates the robot's arms, its claw-like hands blocking the"
560,Doctor's way.) 
561,"CALDWELL: You have got plenty of time, you know. "
562,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I suppose I could spare you a few moments. "
563,"CALDWELL: You know, it's lucky no one was hurt. "
564,DOCTOR: What gave you that impression? 
565,"CALDWELL: Well, surely, didn't you say "
566,"DOCTOR: No, I didn't say anything of the sort. The two colonists that"
567,were living here have been killed. 
568,CALDWELL: Two people killed? 
569,DOCTOR: That's right. 
570,"CALDWELL: Er, we'd better get moving."

572, [Outside Leeson's dome]
573,
574, (The Doctor gets behind the wheel of a small open
575,vehicle with the IMC logo on it. Caldwell uses his remote control.) 
576,DOCTOR: What are you doing? 
577,CALDWELL: Programming Charlie to go back to the spaceship. 
578,DOCTOR: How far is your ship? 
579,CALDWELL: Only a few kilometres.
580,
581, [Communal mess hall]
582,
583, WINTON: So no one from your colony survived? 
584,NORTON: The lizards killed most of them. The primitives finished off
585,the rest. 
586,JO: The primitives attacked you as well? 
587,"NORTON: Well, after the lizards there were only a few survivors. When"
588,"the primitives saw how weak we were, they turned on us. They killed my"
589,"family, my friends, everyone. "
590,JO: Your primitives don't seem too hostile. 
591,WINTON: They were when we first got here. Some of my friends were
592,killed. 
593,JO: You get on all right with them now. 
594,"NORTON: So did we, till we were defenseless. "
595,WINTON: Maybe now Robert Ashe will listen to me. We must move on to
596,another planet. 
597,"JO: You're not just going to give up, are you? After all the work"
598,you've done here? 
599,"WINTON: Well, there's a time to cut your losses. We can't even grow our"
600,own food. 
601,JO: I'm sure the Doctor will be able to help you. 
602,NORTON: What Doctor? 
603,WINTON: They turned up out of nowhere. This girl and a man. 
604,NORTON: Who are they? Where do they come from? 
605,WINTON: Well? We don't really know much about you. 
606,JO: We told you we're explorers. 
607,WINTON: Just the two of you? With a spaceship all to yourselves? 
608,JO: That's right. 
609,NORTON: Do you work for the government? 
610,"JO: No, we don't work for anybody, we just "
611,(Norton gets up and grabs a rifle. A Primitive - a local alien - has
612,just entered.) 
613,JO: What are you doing? 
614,"NORTON: They killed the survivors, all of them. Get out of the way."
615,He'll kill you. 
616,"ASHE: All right, put that gun down. "
617,NORTON: You don't understand! You can't trust them! 
618,ASHE: I said put that gun down! We have a truce with the primitives. We
619,mustn't be the first to break it. 
620,(Ashe takes the rifle from Norton.) 
621,"WINTON: We have a truce all right, Robert, but only because you give"
622,them our food. 
623,"ASHE: You need rest. Show him where he can lie down, somebody. "
624,NORTON: One day you'll wish you'd listened to me. 
625,(Norton is taken away.) 
626,ASHE: Wait outside. I will bring you food. 
627,(The Primitive looks around and leaves.) 
628,"WINTON: Robert, we can't keep feeding these savages. "
629,ASHE: We've got to keep on good terms with them for our own safety.
630,"While I'm leader of this colony, we'll treat the primitives in my way. "
631,WINTON: Even if we starve? 
632,"ASHE: Get out of my way, David. "
633,(Ashe leaves.) 
634,"JO: He's right, you know. You ought to listen to him. He is your"
635,"leader, isn't he? "
636,WINTON: Maybe that's been my mistake.

641,DOCTOR: The Tardis. It's gone!
642,
643, [Control room]
644,
645, (The sleek IMC rocket 157 sits on the clay with
646,"its sharp nose pointing upwards at 45 degrees, looking more like an"
647,aeroplane than a spaceship. A blond man enters and switches on a
648,monitor of the planet surface. Another man walks over to him with some
649,papers.) 
650,MORGAN: I've just got the first survey results. 
651,DENT: Well? 
652,MORGAN: The computer predicts there's enough duralinium here to build
653,one million living units on Earth. 
654,DENT: Excellent. 
655,MORGAN: The thing I can't understand is why this planet was assigned
656,for colonisation. 
657,DENT: Does it matter? 
658,(The buggy comes into view on the monitor.) 
659,"MORGAN: Look, Caldwell's found us a colonist. I wonder why he's wearing"
660,fancy dress? 
661,"DENT: All colonists are eccentric, Morgan, otherwise they wouldn't be"
662,colonists. 
663,MORGAN: Hmm. And what are you going to say to this eccentric? 
664,DENT: The usual story. That we've just arrived and we're surprised and
665,shocked that the place has been colonised. 
666,MORGAN: Suppose they don't believe us? 
667,DENT: It doesn't matter what they believe. They won't be here for long.

672,Caldwell opens a door.) 
673,CALDWELL: Please? 
674,DOCTOR: Thank you.
675,
676, [Rocket guest cabin]
677,
678," CALDWELL: Would you mind staying in here, please,"
679,while I let my colleagues know? 
680,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. "
681,"CALDWELL: Er, look, make yourself at home. That's the entertainment"
682,console. I shan't be long. 
683,DOCTOR: Right. 
684,"(Caldwell leaves. The Doctor sits down in front of the console, which"
685,"looks like a Commodore PET more than anything, and switches it on."
686,Curtains part on the far side of the room to reveal a large screen. The
687,current entertainment appears to be scenes of warfare.)
688,
689, [Control room]
690,
691, (Caldwell enters.) 
692,CALDWELL: I've just brought a man in here. 
693,DENT: So I saw. 
694,CALDWELL: He was at the wrecked dome and he tells me that two people
695,"have been killed. Now, he's only supposed to scare people off, not"
696,slaughter them! 
697,"DENT: Do you know about this, Morgan? "
698,MORGAN: Yes. It was an accident. 
699,"CALDWELL: What do you mean, accident? "
700,MORGAN: They found me. They started shooting. What was I supposed to
701,"do, let myself get killed? "
702,"DENT: You acted very foolishly, Morgan. You should never have let"
703,yourself be seen. 
704,"CALDWELL: Foolishly? Dent, is that all you've got to say? "
705,"DENT: Believe me, Caldwell, I regret this just as much as you do. "
706,"CALDWELL: Oh, he "
707,"MORGAN: Look, there's no point in arguing about it. Besides, once these"
708,"colonists have left this planet, there will be no more regrettable"
709,incidents. 
710,"CALDWELL: Look, two people are dead and I want to know "
711,DENT: You may care to look at this report. 
712,CALDWELL: I want to know for certain 
713,DENT: Look at it! It's going to make you rich. This planet has enough
714,duralinium to double the company's profits next year. Your bonus will
715,be big enough to retire on. 
716,MORGAN: If we get rid of the colony. 
717,"CALDWELL: Yes, well, all right, we can go ahead. But there's no need"
718,for anyone else to be killed. 
719,DENT: I think I'll have a chat with this colonist of yours. Be
720,interesting to know the state of morale.
721,
722, [Rocket guest cabin]
723,
724, (The Doctor is still watching the depressing
725,screen.) 
726,MAN : Scientists have turned to new means for providing
727,accommodation for our ever-increasing population. These floating
728,"islands, rising to three hundred stories, will make living space for"
729,five hundred million people. 
730,"(The Doctor turns off the console, and the curtains close. Dent"
731,enters.) 
732,"DENT: I'm Captain Dent, in charge of this survey team. A great pleasure"
733,"to meet you, Mister? "
734,"DOCTOR: Not Mister, Doctor. How do you do? "
735,"DENT: Well Doctor, it seems a most unfortunate mistake has been made. "
736,DOCTOR: I'm glad you admit it. I take it you're preparing to leave at
737,once. 
738,"DENT: It's not necessarily out mistake. As things have turned out, this"
739,planet doesn't seem very suitable for colonisation. 
740,DOCTOR: Oh? Why? 
741,DENT: I understand it's still infested with hostile animal life. 
742,"DOCTOR: The hostile animals, if they exist, can be found and destroyed,"
743,sir. 
744,DENT: I admire your optimism. Is it shared by the other colonists? 
745,"DOCTOR: I'm not a colonist, I'm a visitor. "
746,DENT: I see. Then you're not really concerned. 
747,DOCTOR: I'm very much concerned. 
748,DENT: The colonists shouldn't be here. My Corporation has been assigned
749,the mineral rights on this planet. Our preliminary survey indicates a
750,very rich concentration of duralinium. You know how the Earth needs
751,that mineral. 
752,"DOCTOR: Earth, or your corporation's profits? "
753,DENT: What's good for IMC is good for Earth. There are one hundred
754,thousand million people back on Earth and they desperately need all the
755,minerals we can find. 
756,"DOCTOR: What those people need, my dear sir, are new worlds to live in"
757,"like this one. Worlds where they can live like human beings, not"
758,battery hens. 
759,DENT: That's not my concern. Minerals are needed. It's my job to find
760,them. 
761,DOCTOR: Even if it means turning this planet into a slagheap? 
762,"DENT: I can see we're on opposite sides, Doctor. "
763,"DOCTOR: Perhaps. Your health, sir. Now, if you'll excuse me. I've lost"
764,some very valuable equipment. Perhaps one of your colleagues told you
765,about it. A tall blue box. 
766,DENT: He's probably enquiring about it now. I'll go and check. If you
767,"wouldn't mind waiting here, Doctor? I'll detail someone to escort you"
768,back to your friends.

774,(Dent enters.) 
775,DENT: Where's Caldwell? 
776,"MORGAN: Oh, he's chasing up some lost equipment for your colonist"
777,friend. 
778,"DENT: He isn't a colonist. Or at least, so he said. "
779,MORGAN: Then what's he doing here? 
780,"DENT: I don't know, but I think he's dangerous. "
781,"MORGAN: Do you think he's been sent by Earth government, checking up on"
782,us? 
783,DENT: Perhaps. 
784,MORGAN: What do you propose to do about it? 
785,DENT: You're going to take him back to his colonist friends. 
786,MORGAN: You're not serious? 
787,"DENT: When Caldwell found him, he was investigating the wrecked dome. "
788,MORGAN: Well? 
789,"DENT: If he were found in the ruins, it would be obvious the monsters"
790,had returned and killed him. 
791,"MORGAN: Leave it to me. Oh, by the way, you, er, you will send the"
792,necessary machinery? 
793,DENT: It'll be waiting when you arrive. 
794,(Caldwell enters.) 
795,"CALDWELL: Whatever that Doctor's lost, no one seems to have found it. "
796,"DENT: You'd better break the sad news, Morgan."

812,to Captain Dent? 
813,"MORGAN: I'm sorry, the Captain's busy. You've been handed over to me. "
814,"DOCTOR: Oh, I see. Well, I take it that your Captain is coming to see"

816,MORGAN: Ashe? 
817,DOCTOR: The leader of the colonists! 
818,"MORGAN: Oh, yes, yes. I'm to arrange the meeting. "

820,"MORGAN: After you, sir. "

823," MORGAN: By the way, Captain Dent wanted you to"
824,show me the dome that was wrecked. 
825,DOCTOR: Why?

836,DOCTOR: No! 
837,"(The Doctor pushes Morgan's arm, deflecting the shot to the side Then"
838,"he gets out of the buggy. One Primitive throws a spear, which the"
839,Doctor catches and uses as a quarter staff to defeat the other two. It
840,"breaks. Then the first Primitive starts whirling a bolus, so the Doctor"

849,"MARY: Just add water and serve, but be careful. "
850,JO: What do they taste like? 
851,MARY: All exactly the same! 
852,"ASHE: Hello, Mary, my dear. How's it going? "
853,MARY: She's getting on very well. 
854,JO: Have you seen the Doctor yet? 
855,"ASHE: No, I haven't. "
856,JO: He's been gone a long time. 
857,"ASHE: Now, don't worry. If he's not back soon, I'll go and look for"
858,him. Have you seen Winton? 
859,MARY: He's showing Norton round the dome. 
860,"ASHE: Well, when you see him, tell him I want him. I'll be in my"
861,quarters.

870,WINTON: This is our power supply junction box. 
871,NORTON: What's he doing? 
872,HOLDEN: Don't worry about him. He's my assistant. 
873,HOLDEN: See what I mean? He gets the right one every time. Seems to
874,know what's in my mind. Weren't your primitives like that? 
875,NORTON: No. We weren't so friendly with ours. Where do you get your
876,power from? 
877,"WINTON: Well, we tap the ships nuclear generator and then beam the"
878,power through to the domes as they need it. More trouble? 
879,HOLDEN: Naturally. This stuff should have been junked years ago. 
880,"WINTON: Don't worry, you'll manage. You always do. Must be that sunny"

892,"NORTON: Oh, much better. Still hungry. "
893,MARY: What do you think of our colony? 
894,NORTON: I think you're managing very well. 
895,WINTON: You mean considering how old the equipment is. 
896,"NORTON: Well, some of it is getting on a bit. "
897,WINTON: Yes. 
898,JO: Was your colony better equipped? 
899,"NORTON: Yes. Didn't do us much good. That junction box of yours, it"
900,looks dangerous. 
901,"MARY: That's what Jim Holden says, but he manages to keep it going. "
902,NORTON: Is he your only electrician engineer? 
903,WINTON: He's the only one we could get to come with us. We'd be lost
904,without him.

908,"NORTON: Well, yes. I feel a bit tired. I'll just go and lie down until"
909,dinner. 
910,WINTON: All right. See you then. 
911,(Winton leaves. Norton sniffs the soup.) 
912,"NORTON: I'm looking forward to this. After a year of living off roots,"
913,you don't know how good that looks.

915,
916," HOLDEN: There, that should hold it for another few"
917,"days. Put the tools away, will you? I just want to check the circuit"
918,relay. 
919,"(Norton enters, carrying a wrench, and attacks the Primitive. Then he"
920,takes the spear and walks towards Holden.)

929,"MARY: Don't worry, Jim'll fix it. "
930,(British readers of a certain age all groan. Norton enters.) 
931,NORTON: You've got to come with me. 
932,"ASHE: It's all right, it's only a power failure. "
933,"NORTON: No, you don't understand. Please, come with me."

936,
937, (Ashe enters to see both Holden and the Primitive
938,lying on the floor.) 
939,ASHE: What happened? 
940,NORTON: I was just coming by. I saw it all. He didn't have a chance. 
941,ASHE: The primitive killed him? 
942,NORTON: He went for me too. I grabbed a spanner and hit him. It was
943,self-defence. I had to. 
944,ASHE: I don't understand it. They were such friends. 
945,NORTON: They're all the same. Treacherous. They get your confidence and
946,then they turn on you. 
947,ASHE: The relay circuits have been destroyed! 
948,NORTON: Your man must have caught him messing about with the controls. 
949,"ASHE: But unless we get this repaired, the whole colony will come to a"
950,standstill. He was the only one who could fix it.

955,to IMC Headquarters Earth. Put it on scramble. Code two nine three.
956,Survey ship four three to IMC Headquarters Earth. Captain Dent
957,speaking. Preliminary survey confirms rich deposits of duralinium on
958,this planet. Complications occasioned by previously arrived colonists
959,can be dealt with. 
960,CALDWELL: I've been checking out the survey results. 
961,DENT: Well? 
962,"CALDWELL: Well, you were right. This is a big strike. "
963,DENT: This biggest we've ever had. I want you to radio Earth your
964,requirements for mining equipment. 
965,CALDWELL: Right. What about the colonists? 
966,"DENT: Oh, they'll have left by the time it gets here. "
967,CALDWELL: You can't be sure. That Doctor seemed pretty determined to
968,me. 
969,DENT: He can be dealt with. 
970,CALDWELL: How do you mean? Where is he? 
971,"DENT: On his way back to his friends, with Morgan. "
972,"CALDWELL: You're the Captain, why didn't you go? He isn't going to get"
973,"back to his friends, is he. "
974,DENT: Morgan's completely reliable. 
975,"CALDWELL: Yes, that's what I mean. "
976,DENT: Where do you think you're going? 
977,"CALDWELL: Look, scaring people is one thing, and I don't mind lying to"
978,"Earth government, but murder "
979,DENT: Stay where you are. 
980,CALDWELL: Now get out of my way. 
981,DENT: May I remind you that I am Captain of this ship and we are on an
982,"alien planet. If you strike me, I can have you executed without trial. "
983,CALDWELL: We can persuade these people to go. We've done it before. 
984,DENT: That man you brought here was some kind of government spy. He was
985,suspicious. 
986,"CALDWELL: Well, it's still murder. "
987,"DENT: Back on Earth, tens of thousands of people die every day. Traffic"
988,"accidents, suicides, pollution, epidemics. "
989,CALDWELL: They are not the same thing and you know it! 
990,DENT: Caldwell! The exploitation of this planet can make us both rich.
991,You could enjoy luxury for the rest of your life if you go along with
992,the Corporation. 
993,CALDWELL: I could exist without IMC. 
994,"DENT: If you get on our blacklist, you'll never work again, for anyone."
995,You're up to your ears in debt. I checked. Don't worry about the
996,"colonists, Caldwell. Just get on with your work and let Morgan get on"

1001," DOCTOR: Well, here are are. Though I must say I"
1002,still don't quite understand why you wanted to come here. 
1003,MORGAN: I wanted to see how much damage these creatures can cause. 
1004,"DOCTOR: Well, you'll find some claw marks over there and some more over"
1005,there. 
1006,MORGAN: And you say these same marks were found on the two colonists? 
1007,"DOCTOR: That's right. Oh yes, it was all very efficiently done. "
1008,MORGAN: What do you mean? 
1009,"DOCTOR: Well, I think the whole thing has been faked by somebody who"
1010,wanted to frighten the colonists away. 
1011,"MORGAN: But these claw marks. I mean, something made them. "
1012,"DOCTOR: Yes, they could have been faked by some sort of mechanical"
1013,device. 
1014,MORGAN: You mean with something like this? 
1015,(Morgan uses a remote control and a robot enters. Its small metal claws
1016,have been replaced by giant ones.) 
1017,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, exactly like this. "
1018,"MORGAN: By the time they find you, the monster will have claimed"
1019,another victim. 
1020,(Morgan pulls a gun.)

1027,"whole story. Monsters don't carry guns, you know. "
1028,(The Doctor kicks the gun out of Morgan's hand and pushes him into the
1029,"corner of the dome. The robot moves forward, claws swinging up and"
1030,"down, and Morgan makes his escape as the Doctor is pinned against the"
1031,"wreckage of the desk, trying to reach the remote control that was"
1032,dropped on the floor. He succeeds and the robot's arms are still.)

1039,JO: I could do with it. 
1040,ASHE: What's happening? 
1041,MARY: Have they had any luck with the relay circuits? 
1042,ASHE: I don't know. Norton and Winton are still working on it. 
1043,MARY: All the domes have been screaming for power. 
1044,ASHE: I've been checking the stock of individual power units. We've
1045,only got enough to last us a few days. 
1046,"JO: Well, then what? "
1047,"ASHE: No power for machinery, no heat, no light. We're finished. "
1048,"JO: Oh, I wish the Doctor was here. He'd be able to fix it for you."
1049,"Look, he has been gone rather a long time. You said you'd be able to go"
1050,and look for him. 
1051,"ASHE: I've got rather more to worry about than your friend, you know."
1052,The whole life of this colony is in danger. 
1053,"JO: Yes, I know, but he was trying to help you. "
1054,"ASHE: Yes, yes, I'm very sorry. I'll send someone to look for him. "
1055,JO: Thank you. 
1056,(Winton enters.) 
1057,ASHE: Any luck? 
1058,WINTON: Norton say's it's impossible. 
1059,"ASHE: Well, that's it then. "
1060,(A noise starts up.) 
1061,JO: What's that? 
1062,ASHE: It sounds like a spaceship. It must be going to land right by us.

1082,
1083," DENT: I can assure you, Mister Ashe, I'm as"
1084,surprised as you are. How long have you been here? 
1085,ASHE: More than a year now. You realize this planet has been assigned
1086,for colonisation? 
1087,"DENT: No, not according to my company. We've been assigned full mineral"
1088,rights. 
1089,ASHE: Then your people must have made a mistake. 
1090,"DENT: Or yours. In any event, we're both here, so there's only one"
1091,remedy. We shall have to send for an Adjudicator. 
1092,"WINTON: Yes, we know all about that. It takes years to reach a"
1093,"decision, and by then you've chewed up the entire planet. "
1094,DENT: I'm sure you agree we must apply the proper procedures. 
1095,"ASHE: Well, yes, I suppose so "
1096,"WINTON: Procedures, nothing, Robert. This planet's ours and the sooner"
1097,"you're off it, the better. "
1098,ASHE: David! 
1099,(The Doctor enters.) 
1100,JO: Doctor! What happened? Are you all right? 
1101,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm fine Jo, fine. Sorry if that spoils your plans,"
1102,Captain Dent. 
1103,DENT: My plans? I don't understand. 
1104,DOCTOR: I was to have been another victim of their imaginary monsters.
1105,They're trying to frighten you off this planet. 
1106,"DENT: That's a very serious allegation, Doctor. "
1107,"DOCTOR: Yes, and one that I shall have great pleasure in bringing"
1108,before the proper authorities. You say there's some sort of procedure? 
1109,"ASHE: Yes, we're going to send for an Adjudicator. "
1110,DOCTOR: Good. I'm sure he'll be very interested in hearing what I have
1111,to say. 
1112,ASHE: Well? 
1113,DENT: I refuse to listen to this man's ravings any longer. I'll send a
1114,message to the Adjudicator's Bureau right away. If you'll excuse me. 
1115,(Dent leaves.) 
1116,WINTON: He really tried to kill you? 
1117,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Yes, the IMC people are using a robot to fake these"
1118,monsters. 
1119,"WINTON: Doctor, those monsters were real. I saw them! "
1120,DOCTOR: Optical trickery so that you think you can see monsters and a
1121,robot with claws so that you can see their effects. The immobilized
1122,robot is at Leeson's dome. Or it was. They've probably removed it by
1123,now. 
1124,ASHE: This is unbelievable! 
1125,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, don't worry, old chap. When the adjudicator hears of"
1126,"IMC's methods, he's bound to decide in your favour. "
1127,"WINTON: Yes, if we're still here. "
1128,DOCTOR: Why shouldn't we still be here? 
1129,ASHE: We're in a middle of a power breakdown. Jo said that you might be
1130,able to fix it. 
1131,"DOCTOR: Well, I'd be only too pleased, but at the moment I'm looking"
1132,"for some lost property. It's a box, a tall blue box like "
1133,JO: Doctor! You haven't lost the Tardis? 
1134,"DOCTOR: Well, no, I haven't exactly lost it. Let's say it's temporarily"
1135,mislaid. 
1136,JO: But don't you realise? Without the Tardis we're stranded! 
1137,"ASHE: Look, Doctor, the whole life of this colony is in danger. Now,"
1138,we'll help you look for your blue box later. 
1139,"DOCTOR: Yes, all right. Come on. Show me what's wrong. "
1140,JO: But Doctor 
1141,"DOCTOR: Later, Jo, later. "
1142,ASHE: The relay circuits have been completely destroyed. 
1143,(The Doctor and Ashe leave.) 
1144,NORTON: What's he talking about? Optical trickery? I've been hunted by
1145,those things. You've seen them. 
1146,WINTON: I saw something. It could have been faked. 
1147,NORTON: I tell you the man's crazy. Those creatures are real and you
1148,know it! 
1149,"JO: If the Doctor says they were faked, they were faked. "
1150,"WINTON: Yes, but he hasn't managed to produce any evidence, has he? "
1151,"JO: Well, why don't we do something? "
1152,WINTON: Such as what? 
1153,"JO: Well, we could find some proof. "
1154,WINTON: Where? 
1155,JO: We could start with the IMC spaceship.

1162,DENT: I'm not sure. 
1163,(Caldwell enters and puts a rock sample on Dent's desk.) 
1164,CALDWELL: These look very good. Have you sent for an Adjudicator? 
1165,DENT: Not yet. 
1166,CALDWELL: But you are going to? 
1167,DENT: Of course. Legality must always be maintained. 
1168,CALDWELL: What are you two going to say when that Doctor tells the
1169,Adjudicator his story?

1184,their retreat. Jo and Winton carry on past a bulletin board. As they
1185,"turn a corner, another bulkhead comes down. They come to a door marked"

1192,(The Doctor throws a switch on the wall and the lights come on.) 
1193,"ASHE: I'm really very grateful, Doctor. I'd better get power out to the"
1194,outlying domes. How long will it keep going? 
1195,"DOCTOR: Eh? Oh, as long as you want it to, of course. You say that"
1196,somebody else has been trying to repair this relay circuit? 
1197,ASHE: Yes. Norton. 
1198,DOCTOR: He didn't make a very good job. In fact one might almost think
1199,that he's been trying to make things worse. 
1200,(Mary enters.) 
1201,MARY: Doctor! There's a message for you from the IMC ship. 
1202,DOCTOR: What? 
1203,MARY: Captain Dent says he wants to see you. 
1204,DOCTOR: What about?

1210,"DOCTOR: All right, Captain Dent, where's Jo Grant? "
1211,DENT: Under arrest. She was caught attempting to rob this spaceship. 
1212,DOCTOR: You've got no right to hold her without 
1213,DENT: You are acquainted with interplanetary laws? She's committed a
1214,capital offence. 
1215,"DOCTOR: I see. All right, what do you want? "
1216,DENT: When the Adjudicator arrives you will withdraw your ridiculous
1217,accusations. 
1218,"DOCTOR: That's quite out of the question, and I repeat, where is Jo"
1219,Grant! 
1220,"DENT: Not here, Doctor. She is rather uncomfortably placed. Do you know"
1221,anything of our survey methods? 
1222,DOCTOR: What?

1231,on top of a cage. Winton pulls at his chain.) 
1232,ALLEN: I wouldn't do that. Not until I've gone. Once the charge is

1247,putting Jo's life at risk. 
1248,ASHE: Then we must organise a search. 
1249,DOCTOR: Dent's spaceship is only a few hundred yards from this dome.
1250,He'll be monitoring us on his scanners. 
1251,"ASHE: Well, what if he is? "

1315,away from them. Then he sees that he has run straight towards an IMC
1316,"mining area, and walks up to the guard in front of the metal door in"

1346,WINTON: The Adjudicator's decision is law. If he says we can stay 
1347,"CALDWELL: Even Adjudicators can be dealt with. Oh, get your people off"
1348,this planet before someone else is hurt.
1349,
1350, [Ashe's office] 
1351, ASHE: It's dark now so they can't use their
1352,"scanners. We'll start the search at the Primitive caves here, then onto"
1353,the Primitive ruins here and here. 
1354,(Winton enters and picks up a rifle.) 
1355,ASHE: Winton! 
1356,"DOCTOR: Winton, where's Jo? "
1357,WINTON: IMC have still got her. 
1358,"DOCTOR: What, you left her? "
1359,"WINTON: Doctor, there was nothing else I could do. "
1360,"DOCTOR: Well, how did you get away? "
1361,WINTON: One of the IMC men helped me but I had to leave Jo in the
1362,Primitive ruins. 
1363,ASHE: Then we'll have to get over there at once. 
1364,WINTON: They'll have moved her by now. 
1365,ASHE: Then we must organise a search. 
1366,WINTON: No. We're going to mount an attack on their spaceship. We're
1367,"going to try and get them to surrender, make them release Jo and then"
1368,get them off this planet. 
1369,ASHE: We're not going to start a war. 
1370,"WINTON: Now look, Robert, I've been chained to a bomb, hunted and shot"
1371,"at. As far as I'm concerned, the war's already started. "
1372,(Winton leaves.) 
1373,DOCTOR: You've got to stop him. Dent'll shoot them down and be glad of
1374,the excuse! 
1375,ASHE: It seems the decision has been taken out of my hands.

1379, WINTON: Come in dome three. Report to main dome
1380,immediately. Do you read me? 
1381,"COLONIST : Yes, I read you. "
1382,DOCTOR: Did you say one of them helped you? 
1383,"WINTON: Yes. Caldwell, their chief mineralogist. "
1384,"DOCTOR: Well, where was he? "
1385,WINTON: He had a survey tent pitched in the north sector. 
1386,DOCTOR: Can you direct me there? 
1387,"WINTON: Well, why? "
1388,DOCTOR: I've got to talk to him. The only way we can save Jo now is
1389,with help from the inside.

1394,CALDWELL: What do you want? 
1395,DOCTOR: I want your help. 
1396,CALDWELL: I work for IMC. 
1397,DOCTOR: Did you know that Captain Dent had given orders to have me
1398,killed? 
1399,CALDWELL: No. 
1400,DOCTOR: Or that they've taken Jo Grant prisoner and may kill her? 
1401,"CALDWELL: Look, Dent's just bluffing to scare you into keeping quiet. "
1402,"DOCTOR: Tomorrow morning, the colonists are going to attack your"
1403,spaceship. 
1404,CALDWELL: Then you'd better stop them. The guards will mow them down. 
1405,DOCTOR: I know. That's why I'm here. There's something that you can do
1406,to help me. 
1407,CALDWELL: What? 
1408,DOCTOR: Release Jo Grant before the attack starts. 
1409,"CALDWELL: All right, I'll do what I can. But you'd better stop that"
1410,"attack, Doctor. It won't be a battle, it'll be a slaughter."

1419,MORGAN: Message from Earth Control. An Adjudicator's on his way. 
1420,DENT: Did they say who? 
1421,MORGAN: No. 
1422,DENT: Doesn't matter. Allen's still guarding the girl? 
1423,MORGAN: Yes. I'd better send someone to relieve him. 
1424,(Caldwell enters.) 
1425,"CALDWELL: Never mind about relieving that guard, Morgan. You just have"
1426,the girl brought back here. 
1427,DENT: What are you talking about? 
1428,CALDWELL: Now you heard me. Have her brought back. 
1429,DENT: You're not in command of this ship. 
1430,CALDWELL: I'm in command of the mining operation. If the girl isn't
1431,"brought back, the survey stops. "
1432,DENT: You'd be breaking your contract. 
1433,CALDWELL: You would have to explain to head office. 
1434,"DENT: Have her brought back. Caldwell, you've just committed"
1435,professional suicide.

1452,Dent'll blast you down without a second's thought. 
1453,WINTON: We've got them outnumbered. 
1454,DOCTOR: What difference does that make? That ship is like a fortress
1455,"and the men are trained. By the time the Adjudicator arrives, well, he"
1456,will have killed them all and claimed it was self-defence. 
1457,"WINTON: Now look, Doctor. We're going to attack this morning and that's"
1458,final. 
1459,"DOCTOR: I see. Well, you leave me no alternative. If I can't stop you,"
1460,I must help you. 
1461,"WINTON: Oh, yes? How? "
1462,DOCTOR: By giving you a piece of good advice. Unless you want IMC
1463,"warned, I'd keep a very close watch of our friend Norton. "
1464,WINTON: And secondly? 
1465,DOCTOR: By helping you devise a less idiot plan of attack.

1513,"WINTON: I'm afraid your guards are rather busy, Captain. "
1514,"DOCTOR: All right, Dent. Where's Jo Grant? "
1515,"DENT: She's vanished, Doctor. I can't contact her guard. "
1516,DOCTOR: Is this true? 
1517,CALDWELL: I think so.

1529,"ASHE: I know where they are, Doctor. I'll take you there. "
1530,"DOCTOR: Good. Well, Winton seems to have seized control. I only hope he"
1531,can keep it. 
1532,ASHE: Quite so.

1541,"ASHE: Well, what do you expect? Norton killed one. "
1542,"DOCTOR: Yes, and Morgan tried to kill another. Where would the"
1543,"Primitives have taken Jo, to their city? "
1544,ASHE: I'm afraid so. 
1545,DOCTOR: Afraid? 
1546,"ASHE: In the early days, one or two of our people went down there."
1547,There were rumours of creatures that lived in the ruins. 
1548,"DOCTOR: Well, did they find them? "

1557,"DOCTOR: My dear Ashe, if the Primitives have taken Jo to their city, I"
1558,must go after her. 
1559,"ASHE: And get yourself killed, or captured too? "
1560,DOCTOR: What else can I do? 
1561,"ASHE: Well, you may be able to buy her back. "
1562,DOCTOR: What? 
1563,"ASHE: Well, from time to time they capture someone and trade them for"
1564,"food. With luck, they should be along soon to offer her back. "
1565,"DOCTOR: Well, I can't just sit here and wait! In any case, I haven't"
1566,got any food to offer them. 
1567,"ASHE: Well, you don't have to worry about that. We've got plenty of"
1568,food. 
1569,DOCTOR: But you're running short. 
1570,"ASHE: All right, if you're determined to go on alone, tell them I'll"
1571,pay the ransom. I think they trust me. 
1572,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
1573,(There is a sound overhead. They up look out of a hole in the wall.)

1581,yourselves. 
1582,(Winton is trying to crowbar open a cupboard.) 
1583,"WINTON: Well, you think so? "
1584,DENT: You heard that ship land. What sort of impression will this make
1585,on the Adjudicator? 
1586,(Winton breaks into the cupboard and removes a sort of hand-sized movie
1587,camera.) 
1588,WINTON: What's this? 
1589,DENT: A very delicate piece of equipment. Leave it alone. 
1590,WINTON: It's some kind of projector. 
1591,"DENT: Part of Caldwell's survey equipment, isn't it, Caldwell? "
1592,"CALDWELL: Yes, that's right. "
1593,WINTON: They why lock it away? 
1594,(Winton switches it on and the growling iguana appears on the wall.) 
1595,WINTON: Optical trickery! 
1596,CALDWELL: It was only meant to scare you away. There was no need for
1597,anyone to be killed. 
1598,"DENT: Shut up, Caldwell. "
1599,(Winton finds one of the giant claws.) 
1600,"WINTON: Well, Captain Dent, I wonder how this will look to the"

1606,ADJUDICATOR : Are both parties to the dispute assembled? 
1607,"MARY: Well, not exactly, sir. "
1608,ADJUDICATOR : Surely you were advised of my arrival? 
1609,MARY: It's the Adjudicator calling from his ship. 
1610,"ADJUDICATOR : Will you answer my question, please? "
1611,"ASHE: This is Robert Ashe, sir. I am the leader of the colonists. "
1612,ADJUDICATOR : Good. Now I require both parties to the dispute to be
1613,assembled as quickly as possible. 
1614,"ASHE: (Into radio.) But things have become rather confused, sir. The"
1615,situation 
1616,ADJUDICATOR : I have no desire to discuss that before the inquiry.
1617,Kindly let me know when you're all ready. 
1618,ASHE: I'd better tell Winton to get those IMC men over here. This is
1619,going to look very bad to the Adjudicator. 
1620,MARY: Why? 
1621,ASHE: We've become the aggressors now. It may prejudice our case. 
1622,MARY: Did you find Jo? 
1623,ASHE: We found where they've been keeping her. It looks as though the
1624,Primitives have got her. 
1625,(The Primitives are hustling Jo along well-hewn corridors to a room
1626,"containing technology, and a small humanoid in a robe with a high"
1627,"collar. It turns to face her, and we see that the large head is half"
1628,"brain, with heavy lidded eyes and thick jowls. Jo screams.)"
1629,
1630, [Control room]
1631,
1632, WINTON: (into radio) What's the point in bringing
1633,over the prisoners? We'll bring the evidence. That should be enough for
1634,the Adjudicator.
1635,
1636, [Dome entry area - radio shack]
1637,
1638, ASHE: The Adjudicator insists that all parties
1639,"should be brought together. We've got to do this legally, Winton."
1640,
1641, [Control room]
1642,
1643, WINTON: Very well. We'll be over in a few minutes.
1644,Untie them. 
1645,ALEC: The guards have been disarmed and locked in their quarters. What
1646,are those for? 
1647,WINTON: They used those to fake the monsters. That's the evidence we
1648,need. 
1649,ALEC: Why have they been untied? 
1650,WINTON: They're being handed over to the Adjudicator. 
1651,"ALEC: No, we're not going to bother with the Adjudicator. My name is"
1652,Leeson. You murdered my brother. 
1653,"WINTON: Now, Alec. "
1654,"MORGAN: But Dent's the killer, not me. I mean, he's killed colonists on"
1655,other planets. 
1656,"DENT: Shut up, Morgan. "
1657,"MORGAN: Now look, I've got all the proof you need. He murdered the"
1658,Leesons. 
1659,(Winton takes the rifle of Alec Leeson.) 
1660,"WINTON: Take it easy, Alec. All right, where is your proof? "
1661,MORGAN: There's a secret compartment. 
1662,"WINTON: Well, open it. "
1663,"CALDWELL: Is he telling the truth, Dent? How many other killings have"
1664,there been? 
1665,DENT: I thought you didn't want to know about that sort of thing?
1666,"Morgan! I'm warning you, Morgan! "
1667,"(Morgan gets the secret drawer in the desk open, but Winton is"
1668,distracted by Dent.) 
1669,WINTON: Now you be quiet! 
1670,(Morgan takes a gun from the drawer and puts it to Winton's head.)

1694,"ASHE: No, not yet. I'll have a go now. "

1706,"DOCTOR: Wait, wait! We must talk! "
1707,JO: He's probably gone to get the other one. 
1708,DOCTOR: What other one? 
1709,JO: There's some sort of creature that seems to be in charge of them. 
1710,DOCTOR: Is it humanoid? 
1711,"JO: No, not really. "
1712,DOCTOR: That's interesting. There must be two races on this planet. 
1713,"JO: Well, never mind that. How are we going to get out of here? "
1714,"DOCTOR: Don't you worry about that, my dear. I'm going to buy you back."
1715,
1716,JO: Buy me back? 
1717,"DOCTOR: That's right, just a simple business transaction. You know,"
1718,"judging by the room and this machinery, it could have been a highly"
1719,advanced civilisation. 
1720,JO: Then what happened to it? 
1721,DOCTOR: It went into a decline. These Primitives could be descendants
1722,of a tremendously advanced race. 
1723,JO: That's just what I was thinking. Come take a look at this. 
1724,(Jo shows him a frieze of images on panes of glass.) 
1725,"DOCTOR: That's extraordinary. A sort of chronicle, history. Buildings,"
1726,"cities, machines. They even invented flight. "
1727,JO: What happened here? 
1728,"DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh. Buildings in ruins, people lying dead. Some great"
1729,"catastrophe, I should think. After that everything changes. Yes, look"
1730,"at this, Jo. A completely different style and design. Much cruder, more"
1731,primitive. 
1732,JO: More recent too. A man being forced through a hatch. 
1733,"DOCTOR: It looks like some sort of sacrifice. Jo, there. Would you say"
1734,that was some sort of time mechanism? 
1735,(Three Primitives and the little alien enter.) 
1736,DOCTOR: How do you do? 
1737,(The alien peers closely at them.) 
1738,"DOCTOR: Don't move, Jo. I think he's almost blind. I've come to take"
1739,"this young lady back. If you go to Ashe's dome, he will give you food. "
1740,"(The alien goes to the frieze and back, then points first at the Doctor"
1741,"and Jo, then the sacrifice image, and leaves.) "
1742,JO: That picture he pointed to. It was the sacrifice!

1749,"ASHE: Those sir, are the facts. The Interplanetary Mining Corporation"
1750,"has entered on a deliberate plan to drive us from this planet, which is"
1751,rightfully ours. They've used violence and murder. 
1752,MASTER: Do you have any proof to support these allegations? 
1753,ASHE: There was proof. 
1754,"WINTON: We found it on board their spaceship. The claws, the projection"
1755,"equipment, everything. "
1756,MASTER: Can you produce this evidence? 
1757,WINTON: They've destroyed it. 
1758,MASTER: I see. Do you anything more to say?

1773,like a conjurer and waves his hand to make it disappear. He then

1788,JO: Where are they going? 
1789,DOCTOR: Let's not wait to find out. 
1790,"(As they leave down the passage, another alien goes past. The"
1791,procession enters the archive room and the first alien walks into the
1792,Primitive lying on the floor. It gestures for the Primitives to
1793,search.) 
1794,JO: They brought us in this way. 
1795,(A group of Primitives spot them and the chase is on through various
1796,passages until the Doctor and Jo are trapped between two aliens and the
1797,Primitives.)

1803,room with machinery. An alien goes to a section of wall between two
1804,flashing columns and opens a pair of doors at the bottom. Bright light
1805,floods out.) 
1806,JO: What is that thing? 
1807,DOCTOR: It's like a reactor. 
1808,(The Primitives push the Doctor and Jo towards it.) 
1809,JO: It's like that picture! I think they're going to sacrifice us! 
1810,(The panel above the doors slides up. Seated on a tiny throne which
1811,"slides forward, is a miniature alien.) "
1812,GUARDIAN: My city is forbidden. Why have you come here? 
1813,JO: I was brought here. 
1814,GUARDIAN: And you? 
1815,DOCTOR: I came to take her back. 
1816,GUARDIAN: All intruders in the city must die. That is the law. 
1817,DOCTOR: We have no wish to offend your laws. The race that built this
1818,"city were intelligent, civilised. They wouldn't condemn the innocent. "
1819,GUARDIAN: The law must obeyed. 
1820,"DOCTOR: Surely the basis of all true law is justice. Look, we're both"
1821,strangers to your planet. The girl was brought here by your warriors as
1822,a captive. All we ask is to be allowed to leave in peace. 
1823,"GUARDIAN: I sense that you are a being of superior intelligence, and"
1824,"although the creature with you is of no value, I will let you both go."
1825,"But remember this. If you ever return, you will be destroyed. "
1826,"DOCTOR: Thank you, sir. And may I say that I'm overjoyed to find that"
1827,justice prevails in your city.
1828,
1829, [Outside the Primitive city] 
1830," JO: Doctor, what was that thing that saved us? "
1831,"DOCTOR: Well, it was a being of tremendous intelligence, probably one"
1832,of the rulers of this city. Three different races or three mutations of
1833,the same race? 
1834,"JO: Come on, Doctor. This is no time for philosophising. "
1835,"DOCTOR: Yes, you're quite right. Let's get back to the space dome."
1836,
1837, [Dome entry area]
1838,
1839," MASTER: Right. Well, I have now heard the"
1840,statements from both sides. I think you should know that on my way here
1841,I contacted Earth and had a check made of planetary records. Now
1842,"obviously, an error has occurred. A faulty computer on Earth has"
1843,allocated this planet both for colonisation and for mineralogical
1844,exploitation. It will therefore be my duty to judge this case upon its
1845,merits. 
1846,(The Doctor and Jo enter.) 
1847,JO: It's the Master! 
1848,"MASTER: Since however the issues are extremely complicated, I shall"
1849,need time to consider my decision. This tribunal stands adjourned.

1853,DOCTOR: And why are you impersonating the Adjudicator? 
1854,"MASTER: My dear Doctor, I am the Adjudicator! "
1855,DOCTOR: Rubbish. 
1856,MASTER: What are you doing here anyway? Did the Time Lords send you? 
1857,DOCTOR: Nobody sends me anywhere. I'm a free agent. 
1858,MASTER: So you've at last succeeded in escaping from your long exile on
1859,Earth. Congratulations. What are your plans now? 
1860,"DOCTOR: Well, my immediate plans are to expose you as an imposter. "
1861,MASTER: That would be very foolish of you. My credentials are
1862,immaculate. 
1863,"DOCTOR: Forged, of course. "
1864,"MASTER: Of course, but immaculate. May I see your credentials, Doctor? "
1865,DOCTOR: Don't be absurd. 
1866,MASTER: What? No interplanetary travel permit? No registration for your
1867,Tardis? No personal identification? 
1868,DOCTOR: Bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo. 
1869,"MASTER: Maybe, but in this regimented age of ours, essential. "
1870,(The Master brandishes his wallet.) 
1871,"MASTER: Without these, my dear Doctor, you do not exist. I could have"
1872,you sent back to Earth as a prisoner. 
1873,"DOCTOR: Oh, is that what you plan to do? "
1874,"MASTER: Not, not unless you force my hand. I think you'd be well"
1875,"advised to keep silent, for both our sakes? Now if you'll excuse me."
1876,
1877, [Dome entry area]
1878,
1879," MASTER: The tribunal will reconvene. Well, I have"
1880,had time carefully to consider the statements that have been put before
1881,"me. On the one hand, while I have every sympathy with the aspirations"
1882,"of the colonists, there can be little doubt that their stay here is not"
1883,"proving a success. On the other hand, we have this planet, rich in"
1884,"duralinium, a mineral that is much needed on Earth. I therefore have no"
1885,alternative but to rule that colonisation on this planet is unsuitable
1886,and the settlers will leave here as soon as possible.

1890, (The carafe of alcohol is half empty now.) 
1891,CALDWELL: I still can't understand how we got away with it. 
1892,DENT: The Adjudicator was a sensible man. 
1893,CALDWELL: He bent over backwards to help us and you know it. 
1894,MORGAN: Caldwell! We don't have to worry about it any more. From now
1895,"on, this planet belongs to IMC. "
1896,CALDWELL: And what happens if the colonists refuse to accept the
1897,decision? 
1898,"DENT: Then they'll be rebels. And we know how to deal with rebels,"
1899,"don't we, Morgan?"

1906,"WINTON: You're very keen for us to give in aren't you, Norton? "
1907,"ASHE: According to interplanetary law, we can appeal. "
1908,"WINTON: What good will that do? By the time it's all decided, this"
1909,planet will be gutted. 
1910,ASHE: The decision went against us because you made us look like
1911,criminals. Now what do you want to do now? 
1912,"WINTON: Capture the IMC men, disarm them and get them off this planet. "
1913,"ASHE: And once we've been classified as outlaws, what then? "
1914,WINTON: Then declare ourselves an independent republic. Break with
1915,Earth altogether. 
1916,ASHE: I absolutely forbid it! 
1917,WINTON: I don't think you're in any position to do that. 
1918,"ASHE: David, you've used violence once and we're worse off now than we"
1919,were before. Now just give me a chance to use legal methods.

1927,(Ashe leaves.) 
1928,JO: Why don't you tell them about the Master? 
1929,"DOCTOR: I can't, Jo. He wouldn't understand. "
1930,"JO: Well, we've got to do something. "
1931,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, the Master came to this planet for a purpose, Jo."

1942,WINTON : You and your officers are to report to the (static) 
1943,DENT: I do not read you. Reception is very poor. Please repeat. 
1944,WINTON : I repeat. Your and your officers are to report to the main

1964,robes.)

1969, [Communal mess hall]

2053,"DOCTOR: You seem to have achieved a temporary victory, young man. What"
2054,do you think is going to happen next? 
2055,WINTON: Now we declare this planet's independence. I'm sure that some
2056,people from Earth would want to join us. 
2057,"MASTER: What, join you in starvation on this miserable planet? "
2058,"WINTON: We no longer need your services here, sir. Escort the"
2059,Adjudicator back to his spaceship. 
2060,MASTER: I think you do need my services. 
2061,WINTON: Why? 
2062,"MASTER: Unless you want Earth to send a space fleet to wipe you out,"
2063,you need someone to adjudicate for you. 
2064,ASHE: Then you are willing to help us? 
2065,"MASTER: Yes, I am. Mind you, I think that you've acted very foolishly,"
2066,"but I've been impressed by your courage and determination. Now, Ashe"
2067,and I have had what could be a very fruitful discussion. 
2068,WINTON: What discussion? You've already decided against us. 
2069,"MASTER: Well, it appears that this planet of yours has some claim to"
2070,"preservation on the grounds of historical interest. Now, if I could"
2071,"investigate those claims, things could be very different. "
2072,WINTON: Investigate? 
2073,MASTER: Yes. I should like to go to the Primitive city. 
2074,DOCTOR: I urge you not to trust this man. He's an imposter. 
2075,"ASHE: My dear Doctor, how can you possibly know that? "
2076,DOCTOR: I tell you that he's not the Adjudicator. If he wants to go to
2077,"the Primitive city, it's for some purpose of his own. "
2078,MASTER: Can you substantiate these accusations? 
2079,DOCTOR: Why don't you check his credentials with Earth? 
2080,"MASTER: Ah. Talking of credentials, might we see yours? "
2081,DOCTOR: Don't be absurd. 
2082,MASTER: I understand this man is not one of your colonists? 
2083,"ASHE: Well, no, he just arrived here. "
2084,MASTER: Does anybody know who he is? Where he came from? Has he in fact
2085,"given a proper account of himself? Exactly. Well now, gentlemen, I"

2090,"WINTON: Doctor, at present I have no reason to trust either of you. All"

2094,DOCTOR: The Master has them eating out of his hand. 
2095,JO: Did you tell them who he really was? 
2096,DOCTOR: I tried to. 
2097,JO: And they didn't believe you? 
2098,"DOCTOR: No, why should they? I've got to get some real evidence. "
2099,JO: Where do we find that? 
2100,"DOCTOR: In his Tardis, perhaps? "
2101,JO: I didn't see the Master's horse box here. 
2102,"DOCTOR: My dear Jo, a Tardis can change its shape, you know. He changed"
2103,his to look like the Adjudicator's spaceship. 
2104,JO: How do we get in? 
2105,DOCTOR: With this. (a key) Don't you remember? When the Master first

2225,"MASTER: So really, nobody knows exactly what's in there? "
2226,"ASHE: Oh, yes, the Doctor does. "
2227,MASTER: Why did he go there? 
2228,ASHE: He went to get Jo Grant. The Primitives had taken her. Shall I go
2229,and get him for you? 
2230,"MASTER: No, no, that won't be necessary. I think I know where he is."

2240,"five, three, one. We have contact. "
2241,DENT: Cut motors. Send in the security guard leaders. We have no time
2242,to waste. 
2243,CALDWELL: Suppose the colonists are waiting for you? 
2244,MORGAN: They won't be. 
2245,CALDWELL: They could have seen us come down. 
2246,DENT: Impossible. We've landed on the other side of a range of hills. 
2247,MORGAN: That's why we landed here. 
2248,(Three security guards enter.) 
2249,DENT: We have landed approximately fifty kilometres from the colonists'
2250,main dome. 
2251,MORGAN: We can be there is two and a half hours. It'll be dark by then.
2252,
2253,"DENT: Thank you, Morgan. You have been defeated and disarmed by a group"
2254,of farmers. Now is your chance to wipe out this black mark on your
2255,records.

2267,precautions. 
2268,"DOCTOR: What have you done, what have you done to her this time? "
2269,"MASTER: The same as I did to you. A simple sleep gas. Mind you, I could"
2270,just have easily used a lethal one. 
2271,DOCTOR: What stopped you? 
2272,"MASTER: I want to use your services as a guide, Doctor. You're going to"
2273,take me to the Primitive city. 
2274,DOCTOR: What do you want there? 
2275,MASTER: That's no concern of yours. But you will do what I ask? 
2276,DOCTOR: I take it that Miss Grant is to be held here as a hostage. You

2285,ASHE: I think he went to see the Doctor. 
2286,WINTON: There's no sign of either of them. Now what are they up to? 
2287,"ASHE: Oh, perhaps they went to the Adjudicator's spaceship. "
2288,WINTON: I've just radioed to it and there's no reply. When are you
2289,going to issue these IMC guns to our people? 
2290,ASHE: I'm not. 
2291,"WINTON: I want these guns issued, Ashe. "
2292,ASHE: Those monsters were faked and the IMC men have gone. Those are
2293,military weapons. We don't need them. 
2294,WINTON: What if the Earth government send troops? 
2295,"ASHE: If the Adjudicator helps us, it should never come to that. "

2341,MORGAN: It was a pleasure.

2378,"of IMC personnel, trespass on a planet lawfully allocated to IMC, and"
2379,armed rebellion against the lawful representatives of the Earth's

2381,WINTON: This whole business is a joke! 
2382,DENT: I advise you to take it very seriously. Have you anything to say
2383,in your own defence? 
2384,ASHE: Everything we've done has been provoked by you. This planet is
2385,rightfully ours!

2387,chance. 
2388,"DENT: You will do yourself no good by this hostile attitude, nor by"
2389,repeating slanderous allegations which have already been dismissed by
2390,the Adjudicator. 
2391,ASHE: Why isn't the Adjudicator taking this trial? What right have you
2392,to sit 
2393,"DENT: You still don't realise the position, Ashe. The Adjudicator's"
2394,authority passed to me when he made his decision. I am now the legal
2395,"ruler of this planet. Now for the last time, have you anything to say? "
2396,ASHE: I agree with Winton. This trial is a farce. 
2397,DENT: I take it you admit the charges? 
2398,WINTON: We've admitted nothing. 
2399,"DENT: On three of these charges, you could be sentenced to life"

2401,"execution. However, the sentence will be suspended on condition that"
2402,you and your followers depart this planet immediately. 
2403,ASHE: But that's impossible! 
2404,DENT: The alternative is execution.

2596,"MASTER: Well, not exactly. I knew it already. The files of the Time"

2606,used. 
2607,DOCTOR: Why not? Super-weapons usually are eventually. 
2608,MASTER: Who knows? Maybe it was due to a degeneration of the life
2609,strain. 
2610,DOCTOR: I see. And so the super race became priests of a lunatic
2611,religion worshipping machines instead of gods. 
2612,MASTER: So it would seem. 
2613,"DOCTOR: Well, may I remind you that their religion embraces sacrifice,"
2614,and that we are the destined victims?

2668,"MASTER: Wait, Doctor! "
2669,(The Master compares a wall marking to his map.) 
2670,"MASTER: Yes, we're very near to our goal now. You will soon see the"
2671,most powerful weapon ever created.
2672,
2673, [Outside the Colonist's rocket]
2674,
2675, (The final cases of supplies are being dragged
2676,onboard.) 
2677,MORGAN: Is everyone aboard? 
2678,ASHE: Yes. 
2679,MORGAN: Very well. Start your final checkout. 
2680,(Ashe closes the hatch.) 
2681,MORGAN: Take the buggy back to the ship.
2682,
2683, [Dome entry area]
2684,
2685, (Dent rips the crop chart off the notice board.) 
2686,MORGAN: They've just started final check-out. 
2687,DENT: Have the guards been posted? 
2688,"MORGAN: Yes, and the other guards have returned to the ship. "
2689,DENT: We'd better get back. Just in case. 
2690,"(Dent and Morgan leaves, and Winton comes out of hiding on the gantry.)"
2691,
2692, [Uxarieus]
2693,
2694, (An IMC guard is watching the dome and the
2695,colonist's rocket through binoculars.) 
2696,DENT : Captain Dent to Security Guard Rogers. Captain Dent to
2697,Security Guard Rogers. 
2698,"ROGERS: Receiving you, sir. "
2699,DENT : What's happening there? 
2700,"ROGERS: Not a thing, sir."
2701,
2702, [Control room]
2703,
2704, DENT: No attempts to leave the ship? 
2705,"ROGERS : No, sir. "
2706,"DENT: If anything happens, anything at all, I want to know at once."
2707,Captain Dent out. 
2708,(Rogers is so intent on the spaceship that he doesn't notice Winton
2709,creeping up behind him until it is too late. Winton lands a good punch
2710,"then they wrestle in the waterlogged clay. They trade punches, and"
2711,Winton tries to drown Rogers a couple of times until he finally knocks
2712,him out.) 
2713,MORGAN: Shall I call up the guard again? 
2714,DENT: Yes. No. Can you get the colonist's ship on video-link? 
2715,MORGAN: I can try. 
2716,(The viewscreen shows a close-up of Ashe wearing a headset.) 
2717,"MORGAN: The best I can do, I'm afraid. Their equipment's pretty ropy. "
2718,"DENT: Ashe, are you receiving me? Captain Dent speaking. "
2719,"ASHE [on viewscreen]: Yes, I'm receiving you. "
2720,DENT: What's the delay? 
2721,ASHE [on viewscreen]: An electrical fault in our life support system.
2722,We're repairing it now. 
2723,DENT: How much longer? 
2724,ASHE [on viewscreen]: Nearly fixed. We'll start countdown in a few
2725,moments. 
2726,"DENT: Excellent. Goodbye, Ashe. "
2727,MORGAN: Do you think he means it? 
2728,DENT: What else can he do?
2729,
2730, [Uxarieus]
2731,
2732, (Caldwell and Jo drive up to the buggy and boulder
2733,abandoned by the Master and the Doctor.) 
2734,JO: Do you think they were hurt? 
2735,CALDWELL: They must have been thrown clear. 
2736,JO: Or else they've gone ahead on foot. 
2737,(The colonist's spaceship lifts off.) 
2738,CALDWELL: It's the colonist's spaceship! They've made it! 
2739,(KaBOOM!!!) 
2740,JO: All those people. 
2741,CALDWELL: And I told them the motors were all right.
2742,
2743, [Guardian's room]
2744,
2745," MASTER: Wait, Doctor. This is it. "
2746,"DOCTOR: Is it? Well, where is this super weapon of yours? "
2747,MASTER: We're in the heart of it. It stretches for miles all round us.
2748,"Look, let me try and explain how it works. "
2749,(The Master puts his map down on a console with a large circular
2750,binnacle in the centre.) 
2751,MASTER: Yes. 
2752,"(He presses a control and picture rises to show a view of the galaxy,"
2753,which then zooms in on a star.) 
2754,"MASTER: Look! That, Doctor, is the sun that gives life to the planet"
2755,Earth that you hold in such affection. 
2756,DOCTOR: I do know a little basic astronomy. 
2757,MASTER: Then you will know that one day that sun will burn through to
2758,its core and explode. 
2759,"DOCTOR: In about ten thousand million years time, yes. "
2760,"MASTER: Well, with this weapon, I could make that happen now. "
2761,DOCTOR: That's unbelievable! 
2762,MASTER: You know the Crab Nebula? 
2763,DOCTOR: The cloud of cosmic matter that was once a sun? Of course. 
2764,MASTER: That was the result of the super race testing this weapon.
2765,
2766, [Outside the Primitive city] 
2767," JO: Well, this it. "
2768,CALDWELL: How do we get in? 
2769,JO: I don't know. The Doctor and I were taken in. There must be some
2770,way of opening it. 
2771,CALDWELL: Beats me. We'll have to find another entrance. 
2772,(The door opens.) 
2773,JO: Look. 
2774,(Caldwell hides as a Primitive comes out and walks towards Jo. Caldwell
2775,hits him over the head and they get inside the city before the door
2776,closes again.)
2777,
2778, [Primitive city]
2779,
2780, JO: I think it's this way. Let's try.
2781,
2782, [Guardian's room]
2783,
2784," DOCTOR: So, you intend to hold the universe to"
2785,ransom. 
2786,"MASTER: Doctor, why don't you come in with me? We're both Time Lords,"
2787,"we're both renegades. We could be masters of the galaxy! Think of it,"
2788,"Doctor, absolute power! Power for good. Why, you could reign"
2789,"benevolently, you could end wars, suffering, disease. We could save the"
2790,universe. 
2791,"DOCTOR: No, absolute power is evil. "
2792,"MASTER: Consider carefully, Doctor. I'm offering you a half-share in"
2793,the universe.
2794,
2795, [Primitive city] 
2796, CALDWELL: Well? 
2797,JO: I don't know. 
2798,CALDWELL: We're lost. 
2799,JO: Yes.
2800,
2801, [Ashe's office]
2802,
2803," DENT: Morgan, where's Caldwell? None of the other"
2804,miners have seen him. 
2805,MORGAN: One of the guards saw him leaving the dome in a space buggy. He
2806,was heading for the Primitive city. 
2807,DENT: Take a squad and get after him. 
2808,MORGAN: Is he worth the trouble? 
2809,DENT: Caldwell's our mining expert and don't you forget it. We can't do
2810,without him. 
2811,MORGAN: What about that Doctor and the fake Adjudicator? 
2812,DENT: The only one we need is Caldwell. 
2813,"MORGAN: There will be trouble about those colonists, you know. "
2814,DENT: We offered to check their ship to make sure it was safe. They
2815,refused our help. It's all in my report. 
2816,MORGAN: Of course.
2817,
2818,[Guardian's room]
2819,
2820," MASTER: You must see reason, Doctor. "
2821,"DOCTOR: No, I will not join you in your absurd dreams of a galactic"
2822,conquest. 
2823,"MASTER: Why? Why? Look at this. Look at all those planetary systems,"
2824,Doctor. We could rule them all! 
2825,DOCTOR: What for? What is the point? 
2826,MASTER: The point is that one must rule or serve. That's a basic law of
2827,"life. Why do you hesitate, Doctor? Surely it's not loyalty to the Time"
2828,"Lords, who exiled you on one insignificant planet? "
2829,"DOCTOR: You'll never understand, will you? I want to see the universe,"
2830,not rule it. 
2831,"MASTER: Then I'm very sorry, Doctor. "
2832,"(The Master aims his laser gun at the Doctor, and the Guardian's panel"
2833,rises.) 
2834,MASTER: What's happening? 
2835,DOCTOR: Wait and see. 
2836,(The Guardian's throne comes out of the wall.) 
2837,MASTER: What is it? 
2838,DOCTOR: The ultimate development of life on this planet. 
2839,GUARDIAN: Why have you returned? What do you want here? 
2840,MASTER: I want to restore this city and this planet to their former
2841,glory. 
2842,"DOCTOR: Don't listen to him, sir. "
2843,"MASTER: You have here a wonderful weapon. Why, with it you could bring"
2844,good and peace to every world in the galaxy. 
2845,DOCTOR: On the contrary. He'll bring only death and destruction. 
2846,MASTER: This planet of yours could be the centre of a mighty empire!
2847,The greatest that the cosmos has ever known. 
2848,"DOCTOR: Tell me, sir, has this weapon of yours ever brought good to"
2849,your planet? 
2850,"GUARDIAN: Once the weapon was built, our race began to decay. The"
2851,radiation from the weapon's power source poisoned the soil of our
2852,planet. 
2853,"DOCTOR: Exactly. The weapon has only brought death, and yet he wants to"
2854,spread that death throughout the galaxy! Unless you destroy this
2855,"weapon, sir, he will use it for evil. "
2856,"MASTER: No! You must be mad! Why, with this, we could control every"
2857,galaxy in the cosmos! We could be gods! 
2858,GUARDIAN: You are not fit to be a god. I sense that if you have control
2859,"of this weapon, you will bring only unhappiness and destruction to the"
2860,entire universe. 
2861,MASTER: Then die! 
2862,"(The Master points his laser gun at the Guardian, and it disappears"
2863,from his hand.) 
2864,GUARDIAN: There is a self-destructor mechanism. You will please operate
2865,it. 
2866,"DOCTOR: Not only does justice prevail on your planet, sir, but also"
2867,infinite compassion. 
2868,(The Doctor goes to the console and touches a device. The Guardian
2869,"shakes its head. Then he touches a lever and the Guardian nods, so he"
2870,pulls it. The room shakes violently.) 
2871,"GUARDIAN: You must leave at once, or you will be destroyed with the"
2872,city. 
2873,(The Master leaves.) 
2874,"DOCTOR: Thank you, sir."
2875,
2876, [Primitive city]
2877,
2878, (The Primitives and other aliens are staggering
2879,towards the control room.) 
2880,DOCTOR: Come back! You'll all be killed! 
2881,MASTER: Come on! Do you want to die with them? 
2882,(Down another passage they meet -) 
2883,"DOCTOR: Jo, what are you doing here? "
2884,JO: Looking for you. 
2885,DOCTOR: We've got to get out of here at once. The whole place is going
2886,up! You have a map. Give it to me. 
2887,MASTER: You fend for yourself. 
2888,CALDWELL: Give him that map! 
2889,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think this is it. Come on. "
2890,(The Doctor leads them down a small side passage.)
2891,
2892, [Uxarieus] 
2893, (The group comes out of a round opening in a cliff
2894,face and runs cover. BOOM! and a ball of flame comes out of the tunnel.
2895,Another BOOM and there is a small landslide. The Master takes the
2896,"opportunity to get try and get Caldwell's weapon, but fails.) "
2897,"MORGAN: Get up! All of you, get up! Caldwell, come over here. "
2898,MASTER: You've arrived just in time. Put these people under arrest. 
2899,MORGAN: Get back to your friends. 
2900,MASTER: You don't understand. I am the Adjudicator. 
2901,MORGAN: You're an imposter. We don't need you. 
2902,"MASTER: You've got to do something, Doctor. They're going to kill you. "
2903,"CALDWELL: Morgan, you can't. "
2904,"MORGAN: Shut up, Caldwell. If we didn't need you, you'd be over with"
2905,them. 
2906,CALDWELL: You're insane. 
2907,WINTON: Drop those guns! 
2908,(A group of armed colonists are on the ridge. Morgan opens fire.) 
2909,MORGAN: Take cover! 
2910,(Everyone takes cover behind large boulders. Bullets fly and there are
2911,casualties on both sides. The Master takes the chance to sneak away and
2912,drive off in a buggy. Morgan runs out of bullets and runs away.) 
2913,"WINTON: Surrender, the rest of you. You won't be killed. "
2914,(The two surviving IMC men raise their hands.) 
2915,JO: The Master. He's gone! 
2916,(Jo and the Doctor get into a buggy and drive off. The Master arrives
2917,"at his Tardis and watches them on the scanner, then starts the time"
2918,rotor moving.) 
2919,DOCTOR: Look! 
2920,(The 'rocket' dematerialises.)
2921,
2922, [Ashe's office]
2923,
2924," DOCTOR: Now look, stop worrying. It was the"
2925,radiation from that weapon that was poisoning the soil. Your cover
2926,crops will grow now. 
2927,"WINTON: Yes, well, let's hope you're right. "
2928,"JO: You know, I still don't understand why you weren't in that ship"
2929,when it blew up? 
2930,"WINTON: Well, we knew the IMC would have to get clear before we blasted"
2931,"off. I hid in the dome, I knocked out the guard and let the others out."
2932,
2933,"JO: Yes, but it took off and blew up. I saw it. "
2934,DOCTOR: Ashe? 
2935,WINTON: He took it up alone. 
2936,JO: But he must have known! 
2937,WINTON: The rocket had to take off. It was the only way that we could
2938,get IMC out of the way. 
2939,"DOCTOR: And Ashe insisted on staying on board. Yes. Yes, he would, of"
2940,course. 
2941,"COLONIST : Doctor, there's something here for you."
2942,
2943, [Dome entry area]
2944,
2945, JO: The Tardis! 
2946,"DOCTOR: My dear chap, this is absolutely splendid. Where did you find"
2947,it? 
2948,WINTON: In one of the dwellings a few miles from the dome. There was a
2949,lot of stuff there that the Primitives have stolen. 
2950,"DOCTOR: Well, I cannot tell you how grateful I am. "
2951,"WINTON: Doctor, what is it? "
2952,"DOCTOR: What is it? Well, er, it's, er, it's a sort of antique really,"
2953,but it does have great sentimental value. Will you excuse us? 
2954,"WINTON: Yes, of course. Mary? "
2955,(The Doctor gestures to Jo and they sneak inside the Tardis unnoticed.)
2956,
2957,CALDWELL: We've had a reply from Earth. They're sending an Adjudicator.
2958,
2959,"WINTON: A genuine one, I hope? "
2960,"CALDWELL: This time, yes. "
2961,"WINTON: What about you, Caldwell? You're finished with IMC. You can"
2962,never go back to Earth. 
2963,CALDWELL: I don't think I want to. 
2964,MARY: You want to stay here? 
2965,"CALDWELL: Well, if you've a place for an out of work miner, yes. "
2966,"WINTON: All right, we'd be glad to have you. "
2967,"CALDWELL: Well, for a start, I can help you with your power "
2968,(The Tardis dematerialises.)
2969,
2970, [UNIT Laboratory]
2971,
2972,(The Brigadier is standing where the Tardis was at
2973,the start of the story.) 
2974,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, come back at once! "
2975,(So the Tardis kindly materialises in another corner.) 
2976,"BRIGADIER: Come on out, Doctor. "
2977,(Jo and the Doctor come out of the Tardis.) 
2978,"BRIGADIER: Well, that was a short trip. You'll never get that thing"
2979,"working properly. Oh, you were right about that report, I'm afraid. It"
2980,wasn't the Master after all. 
2981,JO: He's talking as if we'd never been away. 
2982,"DOCTOR: As far as he's concerned, we haven't. The Tardis returned to"
2983,Earth just a few seconds after it left. 
2984,BRIGADIER: What are you two talking about? 
2985,DOCTOR: Don't try and explain Jo. He'd never understand.
