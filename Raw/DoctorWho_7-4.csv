20, [Research complex] 
21, (The Doctor is driving along and singing an aria
22,"from Rigoletto, but he doesn't know the words - except its title.)Â "
23,"DOCTOR: Ra, ra, rum, rum, da, ra! Ra, ra, da, dum, da ,dah. La Donna e"
24,"mobile, ra, ra, ra, rum, da, dah. De, dah, da, rum, da, dah, bah ,de,"
25,"da, dum, da, dah. Da, da, dah, rum, bum. "
26,(He waves at security as he drives into a Restricted Area. Welcome to
27,"Hoo, on the Isle of Grain. A man with a moustache, dressed in white"
28,"overalls is whistling as he pedals his bike. He stops, gets off and"
29,"takes a toolbox, then walks down a few steps where he meets a man in a"
30,white lab coat.) 
31,"SLOCUM: Hello, John. how's it going on in there? "
32,"BROMLEY: Oh, still drilling away like mad. "
33,SLOCUM: Sound's more like a blooming dentist! 
34,BROMLEY: Yes.
35,
36, [Central Control]
37,
38,(Plenty of computer panels and white-coated people
39,with clip-boards.) 
40,"SLOCUM: Excuse me, Sir Keith? "
41,GOLD: Yes? 
42,SLOCUM: You called for someone from maintenance. 
43,GOLD: Ah yes. I'd like you to have a look a number two output pipe. 
44,"SLOCUM: Oh, on the blink again, is she? "
45,"GOLD: Yes, I've had it take out of service. We've switched over to one"
46,and three. 
47,"SLOCUM: Okay, let's take a look at it. "
48,(They walk down a short passageway.)
49,
50, [Drill head]
51,
52, (A noisy room with more clip-board carriers and a
53,circular well in the middle. This has one large pipe in the middle and
54,several smaller ones attached around the side.) 
55,"SLOCUM: I see what you mean. Okay, I'll fix it up. "
56,"GOLD: As quickly as possible, please. Professor Stahlman doesn't want"
57,any delays. 
58,SLOCUM: Don't worry about it. It doesn't look too serious. 
59,GOLD: Good. Thank you.
60,
61, [Central Control]
62,
63, (Gold returns. An imperious looking man with a
64,"neat beard enters, with his lady assistant staying one step behind.) "
65,STAHLMAN: Sir Keith? Why has the drilling rate been slowed down? 
66,"GOLD: Oh, number two pipe is out of action. Naturally, we had to"
67,decelerate. 
68,"STAHLMAN: Oh, I do understand the technical problems. "
69,GOLD: I didn't mean to imply otherwise. 
70,STAHLMAN: What I don't understand is why you took it upon yourself to
71,interfere. 
72,"GOLD: Well, I saw the malfunction report on number two pipe several"
73,days ago. I saw no report of its repair. I assumed you must have
74,overlooked it. 
75,"STAHLMAN: I overlook nothing, Sir Keith. The malfunction on number two"
76,pipe's not sufficient to warrant a stoppage in the drilling and you
77,have no authority to order one. 
78,"GOLD: Professor Stahlman, as Executive Director of this project, my"
79,concern 
80,STAHLMAN: Your concern is with such important matters as the canteen
81,facilities and the new roster for the cleaners. Anything to do with the
82,drilling is my concern and mine alone. And that includes minor
83,maintenance problems. 
84,"GOLD: Surely in a situation like this, there's no such thing as a minor"
85,problem? 
86,"STAHLMAN: Sir Keith, I'll make a bargain with you. You stay away from"
87,my drilling and I'll let you run your canteen. 
88,"(Stahlman leaves, but his assistant, Petra Williams, remains. At the"
89,"drill head, Slocum loosens some bolts attaching the drill with a"
90,wrench. He sits back on his heels when green ooze comes out. He touches
91,it and pulls his hand away in pain. His skin has turned green.) 
92,GOLD: Bit why is he so unreasonable? You'd think I'm some sort of a
93,rival. 
94,"PETRA: He's been working on this project all his life. Naturally, he"
95,feels possessive about it. 
96,"GOLD: Well, I've got another piece of news he won't altogether care"
97,for. 
98,PETRA: What's that? 
99,GOLD: I've sent for a drilling consultant. A chap called Greg Sutton.
100,One of the most experienced oil men in the world. 
101,PETRA: But this isn't an oil rig. We use a totally different method of
102,drilling. 
103,"GOLD: Yes, yes, I know, but I'd feel happier if someone on this project"
104,knew a little more about the purely practical aspects of drilling and
105,its dangers. 
106,PETRA: When does he arrive? 
107,"GOLD: Oh, any time now. He's flying in from Kuwait. "
108,"(Slocum enters, slowly.) "
109,"STAHLMAN: Oh, have you finished? "
110,SLOCUM: Yes. 
111,(Slocum leaves.) 
112,STAHLMAN: Good. Put number two pipe back into service and accelerate
113,drilling speed three and a half percent. 
114,MAN: Yes. 
115,STAHLMAN: Perhaps we can now make up for lost time. 
116,(Slocum leaves the underground complex and staggers past where he left
117,his bike towards the rail tracks. He leans against a metal ladder. A
118,man in a brick building spots him and runs over to help. Slocum attacks
119,him viciously.)
120,
121,[Brigadier's office]
122,
123, (Sergeant Benton hammers a nail into a wall and
124,hangs a group picture on it. The Brigadier enters from the Control room
125,through a nine inch thick door.) 
126,"BRIGADIER: Morning, Benton. "
127,"BENTON: Morning, sir. It's the best they could do us on such short"
128,notice. 
129,BRIGADIER: It'll do. Have you contacted the Doctor? 
130,"BENTON: He's on his way over, sir. "
131,BRIGADIER: Anything on Slocum? 
132,"BENTON: No, sir. The lads are still looking. "
133,BRIGADIER: Still? 
134,"BENTON: It's a rambling place this, sir. Slocum knows it a lot better"
135,"than we do. If we had more men, we could "
136,"BRIGADIER: No, we don't want a panic. "
137,(The Doctor enters.) 
138,"DOCTOR: Hello, Brigadier. Making yourself at home? "
139,"BRIGADIER: How are you, Doctor? "
140,"DOCTOR: Fine, thank you, fine. "
141,(The Doctor picks up a framed photograph from the pile on the
142,Brigadier's desk.) 
143,DOCTOR: Good heavens. Which one's you? 
144,"BRIGADIER: Well, don't you recognise one? "
145,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, don't tell me. let me guess. "
146,"(The officers in the picture are all wearing shorts, so it was taken"
147,somewhere tropical.) 
148,"DOCTOR: Not that one. Not that one. What, none of them? "
149,"BRIGADIER: Fifth from the left, third row. "
150,"DOCTOR: (laughing) Yes, well, if it's true, I can see why you grew that"
151,moustache. 
152,"BRIGADIER: Trouble seems to follow you, doesn't it, Doctor? "
153,DOCTOR: What do you mean? 
154,BRIGADIER: You persuade me to allow you and Miss Shaw to attend this
155,project as observers 
156,"DOCTOR: Allow? Look, Miss Shaw may have the misfortune to work for you,"
157,Brigadier. I am a free agent. 
158,"BRIGADIER: And within a few hours of your arrival, I have a motiveless"
159,murder on my hands. 
160,DOCTOR: What? 
161,"BRIGADIER: Late yesterday afternoon, one of the technicians was beaten"
162,to death with this. 
163,(Slocum's wrench.) 
164,DOCTOR: And do you know who did the killing? 
165,BRIGADIER: The wrench was found near the body. It belongs to a
166,drill-head rigger called Harry Slocum. We're still looking for him. 
167,DOCTOR: Do you know anything about him? 
168,"BENTON: Seems to have been one of the most popular men on the complex,"
169,sir. 
170,"BRIGADIER: Something else, Doctor. Try touching the wrench. "
171,"DOCTOR: Oh, it's still warm. "
172,"BRIGADIER: When it was first found, it was red hot, as though it had"
173,been in a furnace. Any theories? 
174,"DOCTOR: If the wrench had been subjected to intense energy, it might"
175,have disturbed its atomic make-up. 
176,"BRIGADIER: Chase up those patrols, will you, Benton? I want that man"
177,Slocum found. 
178,"BENTON: Right away, sir. "
179,(Benton leaves.) 
180,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, why were you so keen to observe this project? "
181,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a matter of great scientific interest, my dear"
182,"fellow. First penetration of the Earth's crust. Well, naturally I'm"
183,interested. 
184,"BRIGADIER: Yes, of course. "
185,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I'd concentrate on finding that rigger if I was you."
186,"Well, excuse me, I must get back to work. "
187,BRIGADIER: You're taking part in the project? 
188,"DOCTOR: Yes, in a way. Some related experiments, you know."
189,
190, [Drill head]
191,
192," SUTTON: Getting a respectable tan, bingo! I get"
193,snatched off a drill rig in Kuwait just when I'm sure we've made a
194,"strike, flown back so fast my stomach's still over the Med and I still"
195,haven't the faintest idea what I'm supposed to be doing here. 
196,"GOLD: Well, I asked for a top oil rig man, Mister Sutton, and you're"
197,the one they sent me. 
198,"SUTTON: Well, that's very flattering. Now look, this is a government"
199,"project, right? "
200,GOLD: Right. 
201,SUTTON: So now I'm a sort of temporary civil servant? 
202,"GOLD: Broadly speaking, yes. How do you like the idea? "
203,SUTTON: No comment. What's this supposed to be? 
204,"GOLD: That, Mister Sutton, is the drill head. "
205,SUTTON: That is a drill head? You've got to be joking! 
206,"GOLD: No, that's a drill head, I assure you. The only one of its kind"
207,in the world. 
208,"SUTTON: Well, how deep are you? "
209,GOLD: Twenty miles. 
210,"SUTTON: Twenty miles? Oh, come on now. You'd get such a whip in the"
211,"drill pipes, they'd fracture. "
212,"GOLD: No pipes, Mister Sutton. A robot drill with its built-in power"
213,"source, fed by cables from our own nuclear reactor. "
214,"SUTTON: Twenty miles. Well, you're liable to wake up Old Nick going"
215,that deep. 
216,"GOLD: Yes! As a matter of fact, some of the technicians have nicknamed"
217,this place the Inferno. Come around here. There's the monitoring system
218,"over there, you see? Then over here we have the alarm circuitry. "
219,SUTTON: What's it all in aid of? 
220,"GOLD: Well, soon we shall penetrate the Earth's crust and then we'll be"
221,able to tap the pockets of Stahlman's gas that lie beneath it. 
222,SUTTON: Pockets of what? 
223,GOLD: Stahlman's gas. So named in honour of the originator of the
224,project. 
225,SUTTON: You mean like North Sea gas? 
226,"GOLD: No, no, no, no. An infinitely more powerful energy source. "
227,SUTTON: What do you do with it once you've got it? 
228,"GOLD: Well, according to Professor Stahlman, we shall have, quote, a"
229,vast new storehouse of energy which has lain dormant since the
230,"beginning of time, unquote. "
231,SUTTON: You learn something new every day. Now what did you say these
232,pipes do? 
233,GOLD: They siphon the coolant chemical down to the bore. 
234,"SUTTON: Okay, Sir Keith. Well, I get the picture, but I still don't see"
235,where I fit in. 
236,"GOLD: Well, I want someone on this project who's got a good practical"
237,"knowledge of drilling, and of coping with any emergencies that may"
238,arise. 
239,SUTTON: Are you having trouble here then? 
240,GOLD: Not yet. 
241,SUTTON: But you may have? 
242,"GOLD: Well, it's my job to cover any eventuality, Mister Sutton. Now"
243,it's time I introduced you to some of the senior staff.
244,
245, [Central Control] 
246, (A counter is clicking down from 59:28:47.) 
247,"GOLD: Petra, this is Mister Sutton, the oil man I told you about. This"
248,"is Miss Petra Williams, who's been personal assistant to the Professor"
249,for some years now. 
250,SUTTON: Hi. 
251,PETRA: How do you do? 
252,"SUTTON: All the better for seeing you, Petra. Perhaps you could help me"
253,settle in the place? 
254,"PETRA: How do you mean, Mister Sutton? "
255,"SUTTON: Well, you know, show me round, dash off a few letters. Perhaps"
256,I could borrow you for a bit. 
257,"PETRA: Mister Sutton, I am Professor Stahlman's personal assistant, not"
258,"a typist, and I'm not available for borrowing. Will you excuse me? "
259,(Petra leaves.) 
260,"SUTTON: I'd say I'd been snubbed, wouldn't you? "
261,GOLD: Come and meet the boss. 
262,STAHLMAN: Just take them (unintelligible) 
263,"WOMAN: Yes, sir. "
264,"GOLD: May I present Professor Eric Stahlman, the instigator of the"
265,entire project. 
266,STAHLMAN: The instigator? You make it sound as if I'd perpetrated some
267,crime against humanity. 
268,"GOLD: Hardly that, Professor. This is Mister Sutton. "
269,"STAHLMAN: So I gather. Another recruit to your cause, no doubt. "
270,SUTTON: What cause? 
271,"STAHLMAN: Well, his crusade to bring this whole operation to a grinding"
272,"halt, Mister Sutton. "
273,"GOLD: Professor, please. "
274,"STAHLMAN: Well, he's a dedicated man, you see, dedicated to stifling us"
275,with over-caution and an over-abundance of experts and advisors. We're
276,"drowning in them, Mister Sutton. "
277,"SUTTON: I didn't volunteer for this job, you know. "
278,STAHLMAN: How you came here is of no importance to me. You're here. We
279,"see them everywhere. Advisors on this, advisors on that. "
280,(The Doctor enters.) 
281,"STAHLMAN: Look, there's another one. "
282,"DOCTOR: Our liver playing us up again this morning, is it Professor? "
283,"SUTTON: You have problems, Sir Keith. "
284,GOLD: Yes. 
285,SUTTON: Who's the gentleman in the fancy dress? 
286,"GOLD: Ah, that's the Doctor. A brilliant mind. We're very lucky to have"
287,"him as advisor. Come, I'll introduce you. Doctor, may I introduce"
288,Mister Sutton. 
289,"SUTTON: Hello, Doc. "
290,"DOCTOR: Welcome to the Inferno, Mister Sutton. "
291,"SUTTON: And what do you think of this project, Doc? "
292,"DOCTOR: Well, I think that certain people ought to pay a lot more"
293,attention to the warnings of this computer. 
294,"SUTTON: Like him, you mean? "
295,"DOCTOR: Yes. Mind you, I'm not wild about computers myself, but they"
296,"are a tool. If you have a tool, it's stupid not to use it. "
297,(The Doctor goes to a side panel and flips a switch.) 
298,"DOCTOR: Power for my own little project. Nice to have met you, Mister"
299,Sutton. 
300,(The Doctor starts to leave.) 
301,STAHLMAN: All those so-called experts. It's a waste of valuable time
302,and money. 
303,(The Doctor goes to a technician making notes at a computer terminal.) 
304,"DOCTOR: Give that more lateral compensation, old chap, or you'll blow"
305,the main condenser banks. Cost thousands to put that right. Waste of
306,valuable time and money. Hmm? (The Doctor leaves and Stahlman goes over
307,to the terminal to check.) 
308,STAHLMAN: I'm rapidly losing patience with that man.
309,
310, [Outside the Doctor's workshop]
311,
312, (The Doctor drives over to a hut guarded by a UNIT
313,soldier.) 
314,"LATIMER: Morning, sir. "
315,DOCTOR: Good morning. Any sign of Slocum yet? 
316,"LATIMER: No, we're still searching for him. "
317,DOCTOR: Nasty business that. 
318,"LATIMER: Yes. Still, you should be safe in there. I'm sure this Harry"
319,Slocum character won't have one of your funny gadgets. 
320,DOCTOR: Funny gadgets? 
321,(The Doctor takes out his sonic screwdriver and activates it. The
322,workshop doors open.) 
323,DOCTOR: It's only a door handle.
324,
325, Doctor's workshop]
326,
327, (The Doctor drives Bessie inside then closes the
328,"doors. He appears to be well established here, with full bookshelves."
329,Liz is working. The Tardis console is in the middle of the floor.) 
330,DOCTOR: Any progress? 
331,LIZ: I've isolated one of the faults. 
332,DOCTOR: Good. 
333,"LIZ: Oh, did you get those figures from the computer? "
334,"DOCTOR: Yes, but I think you'll find they only confirm what we already"
335,know. 
336,"LIZ: Well, I'll check them again anyway. How are things at Central"
337,Control? 
338,"DOCTOR: Oh, the usual friction between Sir Keith and Stahlman. "
339,"LIZ: Oh, did you see the Brigadier? "
340,"DOCTOR: There's been a murder, Liz. "
341,LIZ: I know. One of the sentries was in earlier making a spot check. He
342,told me about it. 
343,"DOCTOR: It's a dreadful business, a murder without a motive. Right,"
344,"let's get back to work, shall we? "
345,"LIZ: Doctor, you're not still thinking of making a run with the Tardis"
346,"console, are you? "
347,DOCTOR: Indeed I am. That's why we came here. 
348,LIZ: Now be sensible. It's too dangerous. 
349,"DOCTOR: Look, Liz. Look, without the Tardis I feel rather lost. A"
350,stranger in a foreign land. A shipwrecked mariner. 
351,LIZ: When do you want to make this trial run? 
352,DOCTOR: In a minute. 
353,"LIZ: Hey, you're not serious? Why the sudden rush? "
354,"DOCTOR: Right, we've been over this many times. You know exactly what"
355,"to do, don't you? "
356,LIZ: Yes. 
357,"DOCTOR: Well then, take up your position and I'll switch the nuclear"
358,power through. 
359,LIZ: I wish you'd think again. 
360,DOCTOR: Liz! Please. 
361,(Liz throws some switches then stands by the power breaker.) 
362,DOCTOR: All right? 
363,LIZ: Right. 
364,"DOCTOR: Now, at my signal, give me first stage power and then full"
365,boost a fraction later. 
366,LIZ: Supposing it doesn't work? 
367,DOCTOR: I'll think of something. I hope. 
368, [Nuclear Reactor Switch Room] 
369,"(Somewhere else in the complex, Slocum has now got"
370,"green skin, hairy hands and a"
371,tendency to snarl. He enters the Nuclear Reactor Switch Room building.
372,A technician is on the telephone.) 
373,"BROMLEY: Yes, yes, that's right. All readings normal, no peaks at all."
374,"Yeah. Look, I've done a complete routine check. "
375,(Slocum sneaks in.) 
376,"BROMLEY: No, everything's very quiet up here."
377,
378, Doctor's workshop]
379,
380," DOCTOR: Right. Stand by, Liz. "
381,"LIZ: Standing by, Doctor. "
382,"DOCTOR: Switch to first stage power. Full boost, Liz. "
383,"(7 Megga volts. Sic. 8 would be in the red. Meanwhile, the green Slocum"
384,has blood on his overall. He puts his hands to his head in pain then
385,goes to a lever and pulls it all the way down to the red section. The
386,Tardis console starts shaking.) 
387,"DOCTOR: Too much power, Liz! Too much power. "
388,LIZ: I can't cut back! The circuits are locked and overloading! 
389,(The Tardis console and the Doctor dematerialise. They fly through a
390,distorting nothingness and get separated. Finally Liz pulls down one of
391,the power breakers and the voltage drops back to 7M. The Doctor
392,continues to be pulled at by strange forces. Liz uses a piece of wood
393,"on the other handle to get more leverage, and the voltage drops to nil."
394,"The console materialises first, then the Doctor lands on the floor,"
395,with his feet on the console. Liz switches everything off and goes to
396,him.) 
397,"LIZ: Doctor, are you all right? "
398,DOCTOR: Yes. I still feel dizzy. I seem to be in one piece anyway. 
399,LIZ: What happened? Where did you go? 
400,DOCTOR: I'm not sure. I seemed to be in some sort of limbo. There was a
401,barrier I couldn't break through. We must make another trial run. 
402,LIZ: After all that? 
403,DOCTOR: Because of all that. I wonder where I was exactly? Where I was
404,going? 
405,"LIZ: Wherever you were, you very nearly didn't get back. "
406,"DOCTOR: Well, next time we must ensure that I do. "
407,(A klaxon sounds.) 
408,LIZ: The drill head!
409,
410, [Central Control] 
411, (Smoke is pouring out of the drill head as the
412,blast door comes down.) 
413,PETRA: (into phone.) We must get through to the main switch room. This
414,is an emergency. 
415,STAHLMAN: Sir Keith! Did you order those shield to be lowered? 
416,"GOLD: Yes, I did. "
417,STAHLMAN: Why? 
418,"GOLD: Well, this is a Red One emergency, Professor. "
419,STAHLMAN: Is it? I haven't said so yet. 
420,GOLD: Surely it's quite obvious? 
421,STAHLMAN: Get those shields back up again now. 
422,GOLD: Professor Stahlman 
423,STAHLMAN: Anything that happens in this area is my responsibility. 
424,"GOLD: Well, at least order the power to be shut off. "
425,"STAHLMAN: What, and stop the drill? Petra, have you contacted the"
426,reactor yet? 
427,"PETRA: I still can't get an answer, Professor. "
428,"STAHLMAN: Well, you must get an answer. "
429,"SUTTON: At that depth and that pressure, you'd never get it going"
430,again. The drill bit would seize up immediately. You'd have to abandon
431,the bore. 
432,GOLD: That mightn't be a bad idea. 
433,"STAHLMAN: (into phone) Well, try them again and keep on trying until"
434,"you get 'em. Petra, see if they have the coolant flowing yet. "
435,"SUTTON: Hey, wait a minute. I wouldn't go in there if I was you. "
436,PETRA: Will you let go of my arm? 
437,SUTTON: The pressure in there could blow the roof right off this
438,building! 
439,"PETRA: Thank you, I know what can happen, but I have a job to do. Now"
440,just don't interfere! 
441,(Petra leaves.) 
442,SUTTON: Are you some kind of idiot? 
443,"GOLD: Ah, Doctor, can you make any sense of this data? "
444,"BRIGADIER: What's happened, Doctor? "
445,"DOCTOR: There's been a nuclear power surge. Actually, we experienced it"
446,ourselves earlier. It must have gone quite mad at the reactor. 
447,BRIGADIER: There's been another murder. One of my soldiers. 
448,DOCTOR: Where was the body found? 
449,BRIGADIER: On the waste ground. 
450,DOCTOR: Anywhere near the reactor? 
451,BRIGADIER: Not all that far from it. 
452,DOCTOR: Professor? We think we know what's wrong. 
453,"STAHLMAN: Doctor, stop wasting my time, will you? "
454,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm afraid I was wrong, Professor. "
455,STAHLMAN: What? 
456,DOCTOR: It's not so much your liver as your general disposition.
457,"Brigadier, come on. "
458,(Petra runs in from the drill head as the Doctor and Brigadier leave.) 
459,PETRA: Professor Stahlman. 
460,STAHLMAN: What's happening in there? 
461,PETRA: The coolant controls are jammed with the heat. 
462,SUTTON: I wouldn't go back in there. 
463,"PETRA: Rather nervous for an oil man aren't you, Mister Sutton? "
464,"SUTTON: I'm not nervous, darling, I'm terrified! I know what can happen"
465,in there. 
466,PETRA: And I don't? 
467,"SUTTON: I doubt it. And you're not brave, you're just plain stupid. "
468,PETRA: Professor Stahlman knows what's happening. He can deal with it. 
469,SUTTON: Do you want to bet?
470,
471, [Drill head]
472,
473, (Stahlman and a technician are straining at a
474,valve wheel when Petra and Sutton enter.) 
475,"SUTTON: It's okay, Professor. Let me have a go at that. Hold tight,"
476,everyone. We'll soon have it under control.

488,"DOCTOR: No, don't move. It'll only antagonise him."

495,
496, [Central Control]
497,
498, (Petra is at a control panel.) 
499,STAHLMAN: Still too much power from the nuclear reactor. 
500,PETRA: I think the Doctor went to deal with it. 
501,"STAHLMAN: What? Well, check it please, Petra."
502,
503,[Nuclear Reactor Switch Room]
504,
505," DOCTOR: Look, there's nothing to be frightened of,"
506,old chap. 
507,(A phone rings. Slocum looks around Wyatt dodges behind an equipment
508,"rack, rifle ready.)"
509,
510, [Central Control]
511,
512, STAHLMAN: Well? 
513,PETRA: There's still no reply from the main switch room. 
514,STAHLMAN: What do those fools think they're doing? Hello? Hello? 
515,"(In the Switch Room, Wyatt signals his intention to Benton and the"
516,Doctor notices it. Slocum spots him coming round the equipment rack and
517,"charges. Wyatt shoots, but Slocum wrestles the rifle off him and throws"
518,him to the floor before finally collapsing himself.) 
519,GOLD: It's still not a Red One emergency. 
520,STAHLMAN: I know. 
521,GOLD: Shall I give the order? 
522,STAHLMAN: Not until I consider it necessary. Why does nobody answer
523,this phone?
524,
525, [Nuclear Reactor Switch Room]
526,
527, (The soldiers drag Bromley away. The Brigadier
528,"stands behind the Doctor, ready to defend him should the still"
529,"conscious Slocum attack again. The Doctor reaches for the power lever,"
530,but it is red hot.) 
531,DOCTOR: Pistol. Pistol! 
532,(The Doctor uses the butt of the Brigadier's pistol to push the lever
533,back up to zero. Slocum slumps sideways by the wall.) 
534,"DOCTOR: No, no. Don't touch him. Look at that wall. It's scorched. "
535,(The Doctor answers the phone.) 
536,"DOCTOR: Hello? Oh, it's you, Stahlman. Thank you, we've dealt with the"
537,matter ourselves.
538,
539, [Central Control]
540,
541, (The drill head is cooling down.) 
542,"SUTTON: Well done, everyone. I'll have a new medal struck. The Order of"
543,the Turkish Bath. 
544,STAHLMAN: The emergency has been contained. Return to your normal
545,"duties, everyone. "
546,SUTTON: We contained it by the skin of our teeth. We may not be so
547,lucky next time. 
548,STAHLMAN: The main operation was not at fault. Those idiots at the
549,nuclear reactor boosted the power too high. 
550,"SUTTON: All right, so it was some kind of accident. They happen, you"
551,"know? You have to make allowances, take precautions. "
552,"STAHLMAN: I can make no allowances for incompetence, Mister Sutton. "
553,(Stahlman leaves.) 
554,SUTTON: Petra. Is that man a complete nut? 
555,"PETRA: I don't think so, Mister Sutton. Thank you for helping with the"
556,emergency. 
557,"SUTTON: Well, if you really want to show your gratitude, there are one"
558,or two things. 
559,PETRA: Like what? 
560,"SUTTON: Like call me Greg, for instance. It's my name. All this"
561,mistering makes me nervous. 
562,PETRA: And second? 
563,SUTTON: I've got one or two ideas. 
564,PETRA: What about? 
565,"SUTTON: Safety precautions at the drill head area. Now, Stahlman"
566,"listens to you. If you could convince him I'm talking sense, we might"
567,get somewhere.
568,
569, [Nuclear Reactor Switch Room]
570,
571, DOCTOR: Both bullets right through the heart. 
572,BRIGADIER: But he was alive and moving for several minutes. 
573,"DOCTOR: Abnormal resistance, abnormal strength. That's not all. "
574,(Benton enters.) 
575,"BENTON: Excuse me, sir. The medics are on their way over. "
576,"DOCTOR: Look, they'd better not touch the body for a while. It's"
577,radiating a good deal of heat. 
578,"BENTON: Right, sir. "
579,(Benton leaves.) 
580,"BRIGADIER: The man's dead, Doctor. "
581,"DOCTOR: Heat, Brigadier. Like the wrench that killed that technician."
582,Like that switch over there. 
583,BRIGADIER: What about these two? 
584,(Bromley and Wyatt) 
585,DOCTOR: There don't seem to be any major injuries. 
586,BRIGADIER: Shock? 
587,DOCTOR: Possibly. I don't know. 
588,BRIGADIER: Wyatt? Private Wyatt? 
589, [Storage tank]
590,
591, (Two actors stand on metal catwalks at the highest
592,point of the complex. Which one has vertigo?) 
593,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, I need some answers. "
594,DOCTOR: Mmm? 
595,BRIGADIER: What did happen to Slocum? 
596,"DOCTOR: Some sort of retrogression of the body cells, I think. "
597,BRIGADIER: I don't understand. 
598,"DOCTOR: Neither do I. Not fully, not yet. "
599,BRIGADIER: It looked as if he was turning into some sort of animal. 
600,DOCTOR: Yes. The process was relatively slow and it wasn't completed. 
601,BRIGADIER: I'll have the devil of a job keeping this quiet. 
602,DOCTOR: Why wasn't the metamorphosis completed? 
603,BRIGADIER: That noise he was making. I've never heard anything like
604,that before. 
605,DOCTOR: I have. 
606,BRIGADIER: Where? 
607,"DOCTOR: Krakatoa, the Sundra Straits. During the volcanic eruption of"
608,1883. 
609,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, are you telling me that there's some link between"
610,Slocum and the volcanic eruption in Krakatoa? 
611,DOCTOR: There could be. 
612,(Benton climbs up.) 
613,"BENTON: Sir, Wyatt and the technician, they've disappeared. "
614,BRIGADIER: What? 
615,BENTON: They cleared off before the medics could look at them. 
616,BRIGADIER: Come on. 
617,(Benton and the Brigadier leave. The Doctor spots a figure on another
618,catwalk across the top of more tanks.) 
619,DOCTOR: Wyatt? 
620,(The figure runs.) 
621,DOCTOR: Wait! 
622,"(The Doctor goes after the figure, making sure he always has one hand"
623,on a rail. Wyatt still has his rifle with him. Finally the Doctor
624,catches up.) 
625,"DOCTOR: Now Wyatt, listen to me. You need help. "
626,"(Green Wyatt swings the butt of his rifle like a club, but is too"
627,fierce and his momentum carries him over the rail and he falls about 25
628,metres.) 
629,"DOCTOR: Don't touch him! Whatever you do, don't touch him!Â "

631,Bromley.)

633, [Drill head]
634,
635," STAHLMAN: According to my calculations, Petra, we"
636,can accelerate the drilling speed by twelve percent without any adverse
637,effects. 
638,"PETRA: Professor Stahlman, will you "
639,STAHLMAN: This will advance the time of penetration of the Earth's
640,crust by nearly five hours. 
641,"PETRA: Professor Stahlman, could you please come to Central Control?"
642,Sir Keith wants you to look at something in there. 
643,"STAHLMAN: Well, what on Earth is it? "
644,PETRA: Something.
645,
646, [Central Control]
647,
648, (A metal box sits on a trolley.) 
649,SUTTON: Do you reckon he'll know what it is? 
650,"GOLD: Well, if he does, he's a darn sight cleverer than the rest of us."
651,
652,"(The Doctor enters, then Stahlman and Petra.) "
653,DOCTOR: Hello? What have we got here? 
654,"STAHLMAN: What is it, Sir Keith. "
655,"GOLD: Open it, please. "
656,(A technician wearing flame-proof gloves unfastens the box and removes
657,a vial of green liquid.) 
658,"GOLD: Now, we've been getting traces of this stuff from number two"
659,output pipe for some time now. Recently it's started coming out in
660,greater quantities. 
661,STAHLMAN: Analysis report? 
662,GOLD: None. So far the substance has defied analysis. 
663,"STAHLMAN: Ridiculous. If it exists, it can be analysed. "
664,GOLD: The labs say they can't get near enough to the stuff to carry out
665,a proper examination. It took them all their time to siphon some off
666,into that heat resistant jar. 
667,"STAHLMAN: Then we shall just have to wait till it cools down a bit,"
668,won't we. 
669,"DOCTOR: Well, I doubt whether it will cool down. "
670,STAHLMAN: And who the devil asked you? 
671,DOCTOR: I was just venturing an opinion. 
672,STAHLMAN: Based on what? 
673,"DOCTOR: Krakatoa, actually. "
674,"BRIGADIER: Professor, I have to speak to you and Sir Keith on a matter"
675,of great urgency. 
676,"STAHLMAN: Oh, not just at this moment, if you don't mind. "
677,"BRIGADIER: I must insist, sir. This is vital. "
678,"STAHLMAN: Well then, talk to our good friend, Sir Keith. He's got time"
679,for talking. I haven't. 
680,"BRIGADIER: Professor, in the last few hours, three men have died in"
681,"this establishment. Died violently. I must talk to you in my office,"
682,now. 
683,"STAHLMAN: Oh, very well. "
684,BRIGADIER: Sir Keith? 
685,"(The Brigadier, Stahlman and Gold leave.) "
686,LIZ: I'll examine that stuff in the labs. What do you think? 
687,"DOCTOR: I wish I could hear it, Liz. "
688,LIZ: Hear it? 
689,DOCTOR: I wonder if it screeches? 
690,"LIZ: Doctor, I think you ought to come and look at the main computer. "
691,DOCTOR: Why? Something interesting? 
692,"LIZ: Something downright frightening, if you ask me."
693,
694, [Brigadier's office]
695,
696," STAHLMAN: But surely, Brigadier, this matter comes"
697,"under the jurisdiction of the medical section, or security? It's a"
698,personnel problem. It's got nothing whatsoever to do with the technical
699,side of this operation. 
700,"BRIGADIER: Professor, three men have died. "
701,STAHLMAN: I'm sorry for that. But it's none of my responsibility. 
702,GOLD: How can you say that? These deaths concern all of us. 
703,BRIGADIER: The Doctor believes there is some connection between the 
704,STAHLMAN: That Doctor has no authority in this establishment. How many
705,times do I have to repeat that? 
706,GOLD: His calculations on initial stresses were invaluable to this
707,project. Without them 
708,STAHLMAN: I would have come to the same conclusion. 
709,GOLD: He came to his answers in ten minutes. You had a team of
710,mathematicians working on it for a month. 
711,"STAHLMAN: That's hardly the point, Sir Keith. "
712,"BRIGADIER: Gentlemen, please. I am still waiting for some decision on"
713,my particular problems. 
714,"STAHLMAN: Well, as you say, Brigadier, they are your problems. Please"
715,deal with them as you see fit. 
716,(The Doctor enters.) 
717,DOCTOR: A question. 
718,GOLD: Yes? 
719,DOCTOR: Isn't anybody going to pay any attention to that computer out
720,there? 
721,GOLD: That computer is over-sensitive. Its data is unreliable. 
722,DOCTOR: You talk about the thing as though it was your maiden Aunt. 
723,GOLD: My own calculations are more specific. 
724,"DOCTOR: Yes, well I'll tell you something that should be of vital"
725,"interest to you, Professor. "
726,"GOLD: Well, what? "
727,"DOCTOR: That you, sir, are a nitwit! "
728,PETRA: Professor! Come quickly! 
729,STAHLMAN: That man ought to be locked up!
730,
731, [Central Control]
732,
733, (The green liquid is bubbling and steaming. The
734,jar is under great pressure and cracks are forming.) 
735,PETRA: I think the jar's going to shatter! 
736,"STAHLMAN: Stand back, everybody. "
737,(Stahlman reaches for the jar.) 
738,"DOCTOR: No, Professor, don't. "
739,(Stahlman takes firm hold of the jar with his left hand and places it
740,back in its box.) 
741,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I wouldn't have done that if I was you. "
742,"STAHLMAN: Have that deep frozen at once. Right, return to work"
743,everybody. The entertainment's over. 
744,(Stahlman continues to wipe his hand with a handkerchief.) 
745,BRIGADIER: Are you all right? 
746,"STAHLMAN: Yes, of course. The jar was hot. It's nothing. "
747,BRIGADIER: Then perhaps we can continue our discussion. 
748,"STAHLMAN: I hardly think that's necessary. As far as I'm concerned,"
749,everything's been covered. 
750,BRIGADIER: Thank you for your co-operation. 
751,(The Brigadier leaves.) 
752,GOLD: What about the computer? 
753,"STAHLMAN: Well, what about it? "
754,"GOLD: Well, you can't just ignore it. "
755,STAHLMAN: I prefer to rely on my own judgement. I've been concerned
756,with this operation for eleven years and I know more about the details
757,surrounding it than any machine. 
758,"DOCTOR: I hope so, because its message is perfectly clear. "
759,STAHLMAN: What message? 
760,DOCTOR: Come and see for yourself. It warns that drilling should be
761,"stopped immediately. Well, look at it, man. Are you blind? "
762,"STAHLMAN: That computer, as I have said, is inaccurate. "
763,"DOCTOR: You please yourself, sir. I've done the best I can to convince"
764,you. I may as well get back to my own work. 
765,STAHLMAN: You may find that rather difficult. We can't supply you with
766,any more nuclear power. 
767,DOCTOR: Oh? Why not? STAHLMAN: We need all the energy we can get. I
768,propose to accelerate the drilling by twelve percent. Cut the power to
769,the Doctor's hut. Not to be reconnected under any circumstances. 
770,DOCTOR: That's an incredibly childish attitude to take. 
771,STAHLMAN: If you will excuse me. 
772,(Stahlman leaves.) 
773,"GOLD: I'm sorry, Doctor. "
774,"DOCTOR: So am I, Sir Keith."
775,
776, [Drill head]
777,
778," STAHLMAN: Petra, listen carefully. Start the"
779,acceleration in exactly twenty five minutes time. That will make the
780,time of penetration zero exactly forty nine hours from now. 
781,"PETRA: Professor Stahlman, shouldn't you at least consider what they're"
782,saying. 
783,"STAHLMAN: If I'd listened to all the others, Petra, this project would"
784,"never have begun. And if I listen to them now, it'll never be"
785,completed. Have all systems modified to this new programming. 
786,"PETRA: Yes, Professor. "
787,(Petra leaves. The palm of Stahlman's hand is turning green.)
788,
789, [Central Control]
790,
791, PETRA: Mister Phillips? Professor Stahlman has
792,"decided to modify the drilling rate. Could you join us at the computer,"
793,please? 
794,"DOCTOR: Liz? Go and check the tri-gamma circuits on the console again,"
795,will you? 
796,LIZ: What do you want me to do that for? 
797,"DOCTOR: Look, please, don't ask any questions. There's a good girl. "
798,LIZ: All right. 
799,(Liz leaves. The Doctor goes unnoticed to the power control panel and
800,"flicks his energy supply switch, then leaves. Stahlman enters, goes to"

807,and finds the swagger stick in a drawer. Putting the circuit on the

809,DOCTOR: Professor! What are you doing with that micro-circuit? 
810,"STAHLMAN: You'd do well to mind your own business, Doctor. "
811,"DOCTOR: That computer is a threat to you, isn't it? It could prove you"
812,wrong. Now give me that micro-circuit. 
813,(Stahlman raises the stick to hit the Doctor.) 
814,DOCTOR: Ai tavich! 
815,The Doctor jabs his thumb in the region of Stahlman's collar bone.
816,Stahlman drops the stick.) 
817,BRIGADIER: Doctor! What on earth do you think you're doing? 
818,DOCTOR: Venusian karate. It's very effective. Hold it long enough and
819,the subject remains permanently paralysed. 
820,BRIGADIER: Then I suggest you let him go. 
821,"DOCTOR: Oh, very well. "
822,(The Brigadier catches Stahlman.) 
823,BRIGADIER: Will someone please explain what's going on here? 
824,DOCTOR: Shall I tell him or will you? 
825,"STAHLMAN: Brigadier, have that man expelled from this establishment! "
826,(Stahlman leaves.) 
827,"BRIGADIER: Well, Doctor? Will you please tell me what's going on here? "

838,BRIGADIER: Professor? 
839,"STAHLMAN: Oh, very well. (waistcoat) Nothing. (notebook) Left hand."
840,(keys) Right hand. Satisfied? Now get that man out of my sight! 
841,(Stahlman leaves.) 
842,DOCTOR: I tell you he had a micro-circuit in his pocket. 
843,"BRIGADIER: Well, it isn't there now, and after all, he is in charge. "
844,"DOCTOR: Yes. Well, I suppose I've got something better to do with my"
845,time anyway. 
846,(The computer goes quiet.) 
847,"DOCTOR: You see, it's packing up already. "
848,"(The Doctor leaves, the Brigadier goes another way. Stahlman goes to"
849,"the wall by the Brigadier's office where he dropped the micro-circuit,"
850,and steps on it.)

854, DOCTOR: Did you find any damage to the main
855,circuits? 
856,"LIZ: Two of the by-pass wires were burnt out, but apart from that,"
857,everything seems all right. 
858,DOCTOR: Did you replace them? 
859,LIZ: Yes. 
860,"DOCTOR: Good, good. "
861,LIZ: What was all that business at Central Control? 
862,"DOCTOR: Oh, just a little contretemps between myself and Stahlman."
863,Nothing of any importance. 
864,"LIZ: Well, with the nuclear power cut off, we're just wasting our time,"
865,aren't we? 
866,"DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think so. "
867,LIZ: At least you won't be able to make any trial runs. 
868,"DOCTOR: Liz, it wasn't the console that was to blame. It was that"
869,nuclear power surge. 
870,"LIZ: I'm afraid you'll never know for sure, Doctor. "
871,DOCTOR: Yeah. Would you do me a favour? 
872,LIZ: Yes? 
873,"DOCTOR: Nip down to the control centre, will you, and feed these"
874,figures into the spare bank of the computer. They're some epsilon
875,coordinates. 
876,LIZ: Epsilon coordinates? You usually work those out in your head? 
877,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know, but I'm a bit tired. "
878,"LIZ: Yes, all right. Doctor? "

895,LIZ: What? 
896,BRIGADIER: Didn't he tell you? 
897,LIZ: No. 
898,BRIGADIER: Stahlman's demanding that I get rid of him. It looks as
899,though he sent you on a wild goose chase.

920,
921, (Liz goes to the power breakers.) 
922,LIZ: Nothing. 
923,BRIGADIER: Miss Shaw? 
924,"LIZ: Stahlman's cut off the power. Wherever the Doctor is, he's"
925,trapped. 
926,BRIGADIER: I think you'd better tell me what's been going on.
927,
928, [Central Control]
929,
930, (The clock reads 49:18:33 and counting.) 
931,BRIGADIER: Professor Stahlman? 
932,"STAHLMAN: No, not now, Brigadier. "
933,BRIGADIER: I want you to reconnect the power to the Doctor's hut. 
934,"STAHLMAN: Don't be ridiculous, my dear man. "
935,"BRIGADIER: Professor Stahlman, the Doctor has disappeared. "
936,STAHLMAN: Excellent! At last he's done what he was told. 
937,"LIZ: No, no, you don't understand, he was engaged in an experiment and"
938,"you switched off the power at a critical moment. Now, you've got to"
939,restore it. 
940,"STAHLMAN: Well, I denied the man a power source when he was under my"
941,feet. I'm certainly not going to reconnect it now he's gone. 
942,"GOLD: Stahlman, do be reasonable. "
943,"STAHLMAN: I've been more than reasonable. Up till now, I've tolerated"
944,these crackpot experts and advisors and only offered a token objection.
945,"But now that we've accelerated the drilling programme, I won't be"
946,obstructed any further. 
947,GOLD: You had no right to accelerate the programme without proper
948,consultation with the Ministry. 
949,"STAHLMAN: I have every right, Sir Keith. "
950,"GOLD: Very well, I'm sorry, but I shall have to refer the matter to the"
951,Minister. 
952,STAHLMAN: Please do. I can tell you exactly what he'll say. That this
953,project is vital to our industrial future. The country needs the new
954,power source and Stahlman is the only one who can give it to us! 
955,LIZ: Please. We must have a nuclear power system reconnected at once. 
956,"STAHLMAN: The matter is closed, Miss Shaw. Under no circumstances will"
957,"any power, of any sort, be reconnected to the Doctor's hut. "
958,(Stahlman leaves.) 
959,"BRIGADIER: Well, we tried. "
960,GOLD: What exactly has happened to the Doctor? 
961,BRIGADIER: He's vanished. 
962,LIZ: And we're afraid he's in some kind of danger. 
963,"GOLD: Yes, well, we're all likely to be in some kind of danger, Miss"
964,"Shaw, unless we can persuade the Professor to slow down the drilling"
965,rate. 
966,"BRIGADIER: Will you really go to London, sir? "
967,"GOLD: Well, I have no alternative. Something must be done about that"
968,man. 
969,LIZ: Do you think they'll listen to you? 
970,"GOLD: Well, I very much doubt it. Stahlman was right. They believe he's"
971,the only one who can succeed with this project. I'm just a figurehead. 
972,LIZ: When will you go? 
973,GOLD: As soon as I clear up my work here. 
974,"LIZ: Shouldn't you go at once, Sir Keith? "
975,"GOLD: My dear young lady, this project is at a crucial stage. If"
976,"Stahlman can find the slightest excuse to accuse me of inefficiency,"
977,"who will listen to me then? Now, if you'll excuse me."

981, (Stahlman's left palm is bright green. Petra sees
982,him putting on a white cotton glove.) 
983,"PETRA: Are you all right, Professor Stahlman? "
984,STAHLMAN: Perfectly. 
985,PETRA: Hadn't you better get a Doctor to see that hand? 
986,"STAHLMAN: I'm perfectly all right. I suggest we continue with our work,"
987,Petra. 
988,"PETRA: Very well, here are the latest acceleration reports."
989,
990, [Central Control]
991,
992, BRIGADIER: I tell you there's nothing more we can
993,do. I'm sorry. 
994,LIZ: You don't seem very worried. 
995,BRIGADIER: Professor Stahlman seems determined to blow us all to
996,"kingdom come, the Doctor has vanished into thin air and I have a number"
997,"of unsolved murders on my hands. I promise you, Miss Shaw, I'm worried."
998,
999, Doctor's workshop]
1000,
1001, (The Doctor wakes up on the floor. The objects on
1002,"the shelving are neatly arranged in boxes, not their usual jumble, and"
1003,"Bessie is parked facing the door, not inwards. The Doctor puts on his"
1004,black leather gloves and goes over to where the power junction box
1005,should be. Instead there is a cork notice board with a picture of a man
1006,and a slogan.) 
1007,DOCTOR: Unity is strength? Who's been messing about with my equipment? 
1008,(The Doctor points his sonic screwdriver at the doors but they do not
1009,open. He tries again then opens them manually.) 
1010, [Outside the Doctor's workshop]
1011,
1012, (All is quiet. He then notices the signs on the
1013,"door - Technical Stores and a triangular symbol made of three arrows,"
1014,"the largest one up, and two to each side. He drives Bessie out and"
1015,"shuts the doors, then someone shoots at him.) "
1016,DOCTOR: What the blazes do you think you're doing? 
1017,"(The soldier shoots again. The Doctor gets into Bessie and drives away,"
1018,swerving to avoid the gunfire. A second man joins the shooter.) 
1019,LATIMER 2: It's a saboteur. He was in the technical stores! 
1020,"BENTON 2: Well, get after him! "
1021, [Research complex] 
1022,(The Doctor drives through the research complex as
1023,if he were at Brooklands.) 
1024,"SOLDIER: Halt! Halt, I say! Halt. "
1025,"(The Doctor drives through, scattering the soldiers. As he carries on,"
1026,other soldiers take pot-shots at him. The Doctor stops by a pile of
1027,"barrels, but a soldier appears and jumps onto Bessie. He drives off"
1028,"again, struggling with the soldier until he throws him off into a"
1029,convenient pile of hay. Finally he stops by a row of timbered
1030,buildings.) 
1031,BENTON 2: In there. 
1032,(Benton and Latimer run into the building next to Bessie. A dustbin lid
1033,"raises, and the Doctor makes his escape on foot up into the storage"
1034,tank area. From high up he watches the soldiers search for him.) 
1035,LATIMER 2: Try round the other side! Why don't we go down the ladder? 
1036,BENTON 2: One of you lot come with me. 
1037,"SOLDIER: Come on, come on, come on! "
1038,(There is a snarling noise behind the Doctor and he turns to see green
1039,Bromley. The Doctor picks up a CO2 fire extinguisher and uses it on
1040,him. Bromley collapses with the cold.) 
1041,BENTON 2: There he is! 
1042,"(The Doctor climbs higher, to the top of the gas storage tank, only to"
1043,meet green Wyatt.) 
1044,"BENTON 2: When you see him, shoot! "
1045,(The soldiers on the ground see a figure by the railing around the
1046,"tank, and one fires. The figure falls about"
1047,"10 metres and the soldiers run over to it. Elsewhere, a brunette in a"
1048,brown RSF uniform walks past the Doctor hiding round the corner of a
1049,building.) 
1050,"DOCTOR: Liz? Liz, it's me. Don't you recognise me? What's happened to"
1051,everyone round here? Have you all gone mad? What are you doing in that
1052,ridiculous get-up? 
1053,(The woman draws a pistol from a holster.) 
1054,SHAW: Put your hands up. 
1055,"DOCTOR: All right, Liz, a joke's a joke. "
1056,SHAW: Get back. 
1057,(She blows a whistle to her lips and blows. Benton and Latimer come
1058,running.) 
1059,BENTON 2: Here. 
1060,SHAW: Take him away. 
1061,"BENTON 2: Yes, Leader. "
1062,"DOCTOR: Liz, this is ridiculous!"

1066, (The Doctor is escorted to the Brigadier's
1067,office.) 
1068,STEWART : Come.
1069,
1070, [Stewart's office]
1071,
1072," DOCTOR: Brigadier, will you kindly tell me what on"
1073,
1074,(The man in the chair swivels round to fix the Doctor with his one good
1075,"eye. The other is under an eye patch, and has a deep scar running"
1076,through it from hairline to jaw.) 
1077,STEWART: Is this the man? 
1078,DOCTOR: What on Earth are you doing in that get-up? 
1079,BENTON 2: Keep quiet! 
1080,STEWART: You will find it unwise to be insolent. How did you get inside
1081,this establishment? 
1082,DOCTOR: I beg your pardon? 
1083,STEWART: How did you get in here? 
1084,"DOCTOR: Look, your name is Lethbridge Stewart? "
1085,STEWART: Yes. 
1086,DOCTOR: Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart? 
1087,STEWART: Brigade Leader. 
1088,"DOCTOR: All right, Brigade Leader. Have it your own way. And you are"
1089,Elizabeth Shaw. 
1090,SHAW: How did you know my name? 
1091,STEWART: You've been spying on this establishment. 
1092,DOCTOR: What are you talking about? 
1093,STEWART: Your name! 
1094,DOCTOR: My name? You ask me my name after all the years that you and I.
1095,"Well now, wait a minute. Yes, I think I'm beginning to see what's"
1096,happened here. Might I suggest you just call me Doctor? 
1097,STEWART: Doctor. Doctor what? 
1098,DOCTOR: Smith. Doctor John Smith. 
1099,"STEWART: Smith. Yes, of course. And where do you come from, Doctor"
1100,Smith?Â 
1101,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, this is where we come to the difficult bit. "
1102,STEWART: Well? 
1103,DOCTOR: I come from a parallel space-time continuum. 
1104,"SHAW: Obviously, he is trying to confuse us, Leader. "
1105,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, let me put it this way. I've been transported from"
1106,another world. One that is running almost parallel to this one. 
1107,SHAW: He's unbalanced. 
1108,"STEWART: No, I see what he's trying to do. He's trying to make us"
1109,"believe that he's mad. But it won't work, my friend. "
1110,"DOCTOR: Now, now look, wait. You are Elizabeth Shaw. "
1111,"SHAW: I am Section Leader Elizabeth Shaw, yes. "
1112,DOCTOR: Not a scientist? 
1113,SHAW: No. 
1114,"DOCTOR: Oh. This is fascinating. So many similarities, yet so many"
1115,differences. 
1116,"STEWART: Enough! Now, I want the truth. "
1117,"DOCTOR: Tell me, how far down is the shaft that you are drilling? "
1118,"SHAW: Leader, he is a spy. "
1119,DOCTOR: And Professor Stahlman? Is his liver still playing him up? And
1120,"Sir Keith? How is Sir Keith? Yes, now there's a man who might"
1121,understand. 
1122,STEWART: What do you know about Sir Keith? 
1123,"DOCTOR: Only that he's the Executive Director of this project. Yes, I"
1124,should very much like to see him. 
1125,STEWART: Would you indeed? 
1126,"DOCTOR: Indeed, I would. Failing that, Professor Stahlman. He's an"
1127,"opinionated oaf, I know, but at least he's a scientist. "
1128,STEWART: Very well. 
1129,SHAW: Are you taking this man to see the Director? 
1130,"STEWART: Why not? Whoever he is, he'll never leave here alive."
1131,
1132, [Central Control]
1133,
1134, DOCTOR: Wait a minute. 
1135,(The Doctor looks at the countdown clock.) 
1136,DOCTOR: Three hours twenty two minutes? You're a lot more advanced with
1137,the drilling here. 
1138,BENTON 2: Come on! 
1139,"(All the technicians are in white suits, not coats. Stahlman is also"
1140,sporting dark glasses and is clean shaven.) 
1141,"STEWART: The intruder has been apprehended, Director. "
1142,STAHLMAN 2: So I see. 
1143,STEWART: I thought you might like to question him. 
1144,"STAHLMAN 2: I don't think so, no. You know what to do with spies. "
1145,STEWART: He asked to speak to Sir Keith Gold. 
1146,STAHLMAN 2: Did he? And did you tell him that might be rather
1147,difficult? 
1148,DOCTOR: Difficult why? 
1149,STAHLMAN 2: Sir Keith Gold was killed in a motor accident twenty four
1150,hours ago. Rather unfortunate. 
1151,DOCTOR: Sir Keith dead? 
1152,STAHLMAN 2: He was on his way to the Ministry in London. 
1153,"DOCTOR: Yes, to complain about you, no doubt. "
1154,STAHLMAN 2: Who is this man? 
1155,"STEWART: We have not yet established his correct identity, Director. He"
1156,gave an obviously false name. 
1157,STAHLMAN 2: Have you no idea where he came from? 
1158,STEWART: He spoke of having come from some other dimension. 
1159,"STAHLMAN 2: I've no time to waste on maniacs, Brigade Leader. "
1160,STEWART: Quite so. My apologies. 
1161,"DOCTOR: Excuse me, but what about this computer? "
1162,STAHLMAN 2: The computer? 
1163,"DOCTOR: Yes, it doesn't seem to be working. "
1164,STEWART: It's been sabotaged. 
1165,"DOCTOR: Yeah, missing micro-circuit, do you think, Professor? "
1166,STAHLMAN 2: Obviously this man is responsible for the damage. Take him
1167,away. 
1168,STEWART: Benton! 
1169,(Benton uses his rifle to steer the Doctor back to the office.) 
1170,"STAHLMAN 2: Carry on, Doctor Williams. "
1171,"WILLIAMS: (Petra) Yes, Director. "
1172,(Stahlman leaves.) 
1173,GREG: (Sutton in suit and tie) Will you tell the Director that we have
1174,"no pressure in the coolant pipes, please. "
1175,WILLIAMS: He's aware of that fact. He's had the pressure temporarily
1176,by-passed to the shaft himself. 
1177,"GREG: Well, if an emergency develops, there'll be no safeguard at the"
1178,drill head. 
1179,WILLIAMS: There will be no emergency. 
1180,"GREG: Well, it's still my job to bring the situation to his notice. In"
1181,"my experience, when an oil shaft blows, if there is no safeguard "
1182,"WILLIAMS: This is not an oil shaft, Mister Sutton. "
1183,"GREG: Now you listen to me, Petra! "
1184,WILLIAMS: Must I remind you once again that I am Assistant Director of
1185,this project? You will address me in the correct manner. 
1186,"GREG: All right. I'm sorry, Doctor Williams.Â "
1187,"WILLIAMS: Unless you grant me the respect due to my position, I shall"
1188,have no choice but to report you.
1189,
1190, [Drill head]
1191,
1192," WILLIAMS: All safety factors have been exceeded,"
1193,Director. 
1194,STAHLMAN 2: We are very near Penetration Zero. I will not decelerate at
1195,this crucial stage. 
1196,"WILLIAMS: As you wish, Director. "
1197,(Stahlman goes back into the passage to the control room and leans
1198,against the wall. He pulls of his white glove to see his hand is not
1199,completely green and has also grown thick black hair.)
1200,
1201, [Stewart's office]
1202,
1203,(The Brigade Leader is writing.) 
1204,"DOCTOR: Look, may I ask what is going to happen to me? "
1205,STEWART: You'll be shot. Eventually. 
1206,DOCTOR: Without a trial? 
1207,STEWART: This is your trial. 
1208,"DOCTOR: Well, look, you can't possibly have the authority to do a thing"
1209,like 
1210,"STEWART: I have full authority. Defence of the Republic Act, 1943. "
1211,DOCTOR: Republic? 
1212,STEWART: Yes. 
1213,DOCTOR: Then what's happened to the Royal 
1214,STEWART: Executed. All of them. 
1215,DOCTOR: Pity. A charming family. I knew her great grandfather in Paris.
1216,"Do you know, I remember on one occasion "
1217,BENTON 2: On your feet! 
1218,"DOCTOR: Look, I've been standing here for quite some time. "
1219,BENTON 2: You'll be standing for a lot longer yet. 
1220,DOCTOR: Why is this place crawling with you oafs in uniform? 
1221,STEWART: You are talking of the Republican Security Forces. And the
1222,reason we are here is that this is a scientific labour camp. 
1223,"DOCTOR: Staffed by slave labour, I take it? Well, you're all in very"
1224,grave danger. 
1225,STEWART: We are in danger? 
1226,"DOCTOR: Before that computer broke down, it was transmitting danger"
1227,"signals, was it not? "
1228,STEWART: You're very well informed. 
1229,DOCTOR: And what about Harry Slocum? 
1230,STEWART: What do you know about him? 
1231,DOCTOR: Only that he went berserk and started killing people. 
1232,STEWART: You condemn yourself. No one but a spy could know so much. 
1233,"DOCTOR: Look, I am not a spy. I've seen it all before. "
1234,STEWART: Where? 
1235,DOCTOR: In another world. 
1236,STEWART: Very well. I can wait. 
1237,DOCTOR: You're just wasting time. 
1238,STEWART: We work to an orderly system. Your identity is being checked
1239,"with Central Records. When we know who you are, the real interrogation"
1240,will begin. 
1241,DOCTOR: But I don't exist in your world! 
1242,STEWART: Then you won't feel the bullets when we shoot you. 
1243,(A telephone buzzes.) 
1244,"STEWART: Yes? Right, I'll be there. The prisoner will remain here. "
1245,"BENTON 2: Yes, Leader. "
1246, [Central Control]
1247,
1248, SHAW: I've just been on the telephone to Central
1249,Records about our prisoner. I gave them a full description. 
1250,STEWART: Well? Who is he? 
1251,SHAW: They've checked and re-checked. There is absolutely no one
1252,answering to his description on their files. The man does not exist. 
1253,STEWART: That's impossible! 
1254,"SHAW: They'll going on checking, but they're certain that this man is"
1255,not a known agent of any foreign government. 
1256,STEWART: Central Records have never been wrong before. 
1257,"SHAW: He seems to know so much about this whole project, Leader, as"
1258,though he'd been here for weeks. It just doesn't make sense.
1259,
1260, [Stewart's office]
1261,
1262, (Stewart and Shaw enter.) 
1263,STEWART: You are giving us a great deal of trouble. 
1264,DOCTOR: I'm delighted to hear that. 
1265,STEWART: You'd make things much easier for yourself if you'll tell us
1266,who you are. 
1267,"DOCTOR: Proper little bureaucrat, aren't you? Can't shoot me unless"
1268,"you've filled in all the forms, is that it? "
1269,"SHAW: Unless you co-operate, you'll soon be in front of a firing squad."
1270,You have very little time left. 
1271,"DOCTOR: My dear young lady, if that computer was functioning, it would"
1272,warn us that we all have very little time left!

1275,
1276, WILLIAMS: (into phone) Number two output pipe
1277,again. Is the leak bad? I see. 
1278,SUTTON: Trouble. 
1279,WILLIAMS: A minor detail. 
1280,SUTTON: At the drill head? 
1281,WILLIAMS: Yes. 
1282,SUTTON: There's no such thing as a minor detail at the drill head. 
1283,WILLIAMS: Director? They report a minor leak in number two output pipe.
1284,
1285,STAHLMAN 2: So? 
1286,SUTTON: So something should have been done about it immediately. We are
1287,approaching final countdown. 
1288,STAHLMAN 2: Have one of the duty riggers see to it. 
1289,"WILLIAMS: Yes, Director. "
1290,"SUTTON: I think you should for yourself, sir. It could be important. "
1291,"STAHLMAN 2: Don't presume to tell me what I should or shouldn't do,"
1292,Sutton!

1298,
1299, STEWART: Watch him! 
1300,(Stewart and Shaw leave. The Doctor gestures Benton to come closer.) 
1301,"DOCTOR: Tell me, have you ever seen anything like this before? "
1302,"(The Doctor holds up his right hand, then jabs his fore and middle"
1303,fingers into the top of Benton's sternum. He collapses.) 
1304, [Central Control]
1305,
1306, (The Doctor hides round the corner in the Control
1307,room as technicians run into the drill head. Benton goes in the wrong
1308,"direction. At the drill head, green ooze is coming out of the pipe by"
1309,the smoking drill.) 
1310,STEWART: All security units alert. All units alert and take up
1311,emergency stations immediately. No technician will be allowed to leave
1312,his post. I say again. All security units alert. All units alert and
1313,take up emergency stations immediately. 
1314,(The Doctor crawls over to the computer.) 
1315,STEWART: No technician will be allowed to leave his post. 
1316,(The Doctor finds a tool box. A group of technicians are putting on
1317,environment suits.) 
1318,"GREG: Come on, hurry up, hurry up! Get those suits on! Doctor Williams!"
1319,The coolant pipes. Get me some extra power laid on for the reserve
1320,supply. Come on! 
1321,WILLIAMS: Prepare to alter your pressure readings! Begin readings at
1322,twelve! Hold your pressure at fifty. Forty. 
1323,(The Brigade Leader and a soldier have their guns ready.) 
1324,"STEWART: Get back! Get back to your posts! If this place goes up, we'll"
1325,all go up with it! Get back or we fire! 
1326,STAHLMAN 2: The emergency will be contained! Remain at your posts! 
1327,(Stahlman spots the Doctor searching the tool box.) 
1328,STAHLMAN 2: Benton! 
1329,"DOCTOR: Come on, come on, where are you? "
1330,BENTON 2: What do you think you're doing? 
1331,DOCTOR: Trying to find a particular micro-circuit. I may be able to
1332,repair your computer for you. 
1333,BENTON 2: Outside. We've got a firing squad waiting for you. 
1334,"DOCTOR: You idiot! If I don't repair this computer, you'll all be blown"
1335,
1336,"BENTON 2: Look! Are you coming with me quietly, or do I shoot you here"

1342," SHAW: Just a moment, Benton. What's going on? "
1343,BENTON 2: I was about to take him out and shoot him. 
1344,SHAW: Not yet. I'll take charge of him. 
1345,"DOCTOR: Thank you, Section Leader. "
1346,"SHAW: I am not concerned with saving your skin, only in carrying out"
1347,the correct procedure. 
1348,"DOCTOR: Nevertheless, thank you, just the same. Oh, incidentally, I"
1349,think I may be able to repair your computer for you. 
1350,SHAW: Leave it alone. It's none of your concern. 
1351,DOCTOR: I should say it was everybody's concern. 
1352,SHAW: Take him into the office. 
1353,"DOCTOR: Wait a minute! Wait a minute, wait a minute. I think this might"
1354,be it. 
1355,BENTON 2: Come on. 
1356,"DOCTOR: Hang on, just a moment. "
1357,(The Doctor opens the panel on the back of the computer.) 
1358,"BENTON 2: I said, come on! "
1359,SHAW: Let him try. 
1360,BENTON 2: But Leader! 
1361,SHAW: Let him try. We've got nothing to lose. 
1362,"(The Doctor fits the micro-circuit, then switches the computer back on."
1363,The ticker starts rattling out information. Greg enters.) 
1364,DOCTOR: You see? The computer's already aware of the situation and is
1365,assessing its immediate problems. 
1366,(Stahlman and Petra enter.) 
1367,STAHLMAN 2: What's this man still doing here? 
1368,"SHAW: He has repaired the computer, Director. "
1369,STAHLMAN 2: He shouldn't have been allowed anywhere near it. He's a
1370,dangerous spy. He sabotaged the computer. 
1371,DOCTOR: I was not sabotaging it. I was repairing it. 
1372,"SHAW: The computer is working again, Director. "
1373,"GREG: Well, shouldn't we see what it's got to say? "
1374,STAHLMAN 2: We are working to my calculations. 
1375,GREG: Do your calculations tell you how to deal with this emergency? 
1376,"STAHLMAN 2: I have everything under control, yes. "
1377,"GREG: Well, it doesn't look that way to me. "
1378,"STAHLMAN 2: Watch your tongue, Sutton! "
1379,GREG: Can you transcribe what the computer's saying? 
1380,DOCTOR: Yes. The pressures and the heat are overwhelming the present
1381,velocity of the drill head. 
1382,WILLIAMS: What can we do about it? 
1383,"DOCTOR: Well, you can disperse the heat and the pressure. "
1384,GREG: How? 
1385,DOCTOR: By creating a reverse vortex at the bottom of the shaft. 
1386,STAHLMAN 2: And how do we do that? 
1387,DOCTOR: Reversing all the systems. 
1388,STAHLMAN 2: And bring the whole programme to a stand-still? 
1389,GREG: It's not such a crazy idea. It's been done before. 
1390,"STAHLMAN 2: With an oil shaft, Sutton. "
1391,"GREG: Yes. But when everything else had failed, instead of closing down"
1392,"the whole shebang, someone threw everything into reverse. "
1393,"STAHLMAN 2: No, it's out of the question. "
1394,GREG: At least it's worth a try. What have we got to lose? 
1395,STAHLMAN 2: We could smash the whole system. 
1396,GREG: It looks to me as if it's getting pretty well smashed up as it is
1397,now. 
1398,"DOCTOR: Now look, you two are just wasting time. What I suggest is"
1399,this. We push all the coolant down the output pipe and then draw up all
1400,the debris from the bottom of the shaft through the inlet pipe. 
1401,"GREG: Well, what about it? "
1402,(A second alarm bell starts up.) 
1403,"STAHLMAN 2: Oh, very well. Reverse all systems! Bypass number two"
1404,outlet pipe. 
1405,"GREG: Right! Come on, Doctor Williams. "
1406,STAHLMAN 2: And get this man out of my control area now. 
1407,DOCTOR: Of all the ungrateful nitwits!

1414,SHAW: You're a scientist. 
1415,"DOCTOR: Of sorts, yes. "
1416,SHAW: Where do you come from? 
1417,DOCTOR: I've already told you. I come from a parallel space-time
1418,continuum. A twin world of this. 
1419,"SHAW: If you told us the truth, there might be some hope for you. "
1420,DOCTOR: Your counterpart in the other world would tell you that I'm not
1421,"in the habit of telling lies, Elizabeth. "
1422,"SHAW: This other woman, the one that looks like me. "
1423,"DOCTOR: It's not that she looks like you, she is you. I do wish I could"
1424,make you understand this. 
1425,SHAW: What does she do? 
1426,DOCTOR: Do? She's a scientist. 
1427,"SHAW: I am a security officer so there's no possible link, is there? "
1428,"DOCTOR: Did you ever think of becoming a scientist? Yes. Yes, I can see"
1429,that you did. 
1430,SHAW: I read physics at university. What's that got to do with it? 
1431,DOCTOR: Simply that her mind process runs along a similar parallel to
1432,yours. Doesn't that strike you as significant? 
1433,SHAW: Not particularly. 
1434,"DOCTOR: Look, Elizabeth, please try and think. Whatever they taught you"
1435,"in this bigoted world of yours, you've still got a mind of your own."

1443,(The alarms stop.) 
1444,GREG: How come he saves our skin? 
1445,WILLIAMS: He's trying to save his own. Hadn't you better get number two
1446,output pipe working? 
1447,GREG: It'll mean cutting down the drill to minimum revs. 
1448,WILLIAMS: The Director won't like that. 
1449,"GREG: Well then, he'll have to lump it, won't he? There's no"
1450,alternative. 
1451,"WILLIAMS: Sutton, if you would only curb this insolent streak, you"
1452,might have a great future as a servant of the State. 
1453,"GREG: What, and become a nice well-behaved little zombie, you mean,"
1454,"like the rest of you? No, thank you. "
1455,WILLIAMS: You've only survived so long because you have certain
1456,"usefulness, because of your technical skills. Once this project is over"

1458,GREG: Greg Sutton's for the high jump. A nasty little accident in the
1459,"cells, or shot whilst trying to escape? "

1469,SHAW: Your idea worked. 
1470,DOCTOR: Maybe you'll give me a medal. Posthumously. 
1471,SHAW: You find the idea of death amusing? 
1472,"DOCTOR: No, not particularly. Do you? "
1473,"SHAW: If you told me the true facts about yourself, I may be able to"
1474,help you. 
1475,"DOCTOR: Elizabeth, I am trying to help you! You said the emergency was"

1485,"STAHLMAN 2: No, I intend to accelerate again as soon as possible. "
1486,"GREG: Well, I don't advise it. "
1487,STAHLMAN 2: I don't need advice. 
1488,GREG: Except from that prisoner! 
1489,STAHLMAN 2: I would have come to the same conclusions. 
1490,GREG: You may have come to them a bit too late. 
1491,"STAHLMAN 2: I sometimes wonder why I tolerate you, Sutton. "
1492,GREG: That's easy. On a project like this you don't just need a good
1493,"party member, you need a good engineer. "
1494,"STAHLMAN 2: Oh, you are useful, but you're not indispensable. "
1495,GREG: It seems to be my day for getting warnings. 
1496,"STAHLMAN 2: You have a bad record, Sutton, a long history. It would be"

1519,SHAW: Everybody talks.

1521,STEWART: The information must exist and you will give it to us! 
1522,SHAW: Name? 
1523,STEWART: Who sent you here?! 
1524,SHAW: Which of our enemies are you working for? 
1525,STEWART: Who are your associates? 
1526,DOCTOR: I came here on my own. I came by accident. I came here. The
1527,Tardis console slipped me sideways in time. Slipped me sideways in
1528,time. 
1529,SHAW: Shall we proceed to stage two interrogation? He's just babbling. 
1530,"STEWART: No, he's a tough one. He might die before he talked. "
1531,SHAW: Yes. We'd better let him get his strength back.

1541,"DOCTOR: I see you're wearing white cotton gloves, Director. May we ask"
1542,why? 
1543,STAHLMAN 2: You're allowing the prisoner to be impertinent? 
1544,"DOCTOR: Brigade Leader, ask him to take off his left glove. I think"
1545,you'll find it very interesting. 
1546,STEWART: Director? 
1547,"STAHLMAN 2: Well, they say a madman should be humoured. "
1548,(Stahlman has bandages under the glove.) 
1549,"DOCTOR: Why the bandages, professor? "
1550,STAHLMAN 2: I scorched my hands. 
1551,"DOCTOR: You touched some of that green substance, from that cracked"
1552,"jar, didn't you? Just a little, but it's enough to infect you. "
1553,"STEWART: Benton! Take him away, down to the security cells. "
1554,DOCTOR: Listen to me. You're seriously ill. You've been infected. 
1555,STAHLMAN 2: Take him away.

1567,STEWART: Security? Is my responsibility. 
1568,STAHLMAN 2: Since you allowed the man to enter the complex and roam
1569,about at will 
1570,STEWART: The man was caught! He is no longer a danger to us. The people
1571,"who sent him, how and why he came here, this information is vital. "

1757,GREG: We could do with some plain old fashioned luck as well. Where's
1758,the Director?

1843,"DOCTOR: You're not thinking of going in there, are you? "
1844,"GREG: Don't worry, I've never seen a bore I couldn't cap yet. "
1845,DOCTOR: There's never been a bore like this one. 
1846,GREG: The first thing we've got to do is get in there and check the
1847,main valve and get the coolant reserve flowing. 
1848,(Stahlman walks towards the drill head.) 
1849,"GREG: Stahlman! If you're thinking of going in there, you'd better put"
1850,this suit on! 
1851,"DOCTOR: Somehow, I don't think he feels the heat as we do. "
1852,(Stahlman walks off with a suit.) 
1853,SHAW: Can they contain the emergency from here? 
1854,"WILLIAMS: No, they have to go for the actual drill head. "
1855,"(Somewhere in the complex, a storage tank explodes. Green ooze is still"
1856,coming out of the smoking drill head.) 
1857,"GREG: Come on, Doctor. "
1858,"DOCTOR: Well, here goes. "
1859,(They put on the protective hoods and go into the drill head. Greg goes
1860,straight to a big red wheel valve while the Doctor checks the various
1861,"people lying around. Stahlman, also in a suit, thumps Greg over the"
1862,"back of the head with an iron bar, takes off his hood and starts to"
1863,"drag him away. The Doctor rushes over to grapple with Stahlman, and"
1864,gets thrown onto his back several times. Greg gets up and hits Stahlman
1865,with the bar. The Doctor helps him out of the drill head and back into
1866,the control room.) 
1867,"GREG: Oh, what the devil hit me? "
1868,DOCTOR: A piece of pipe held by Stahlman. 
1869,GREG: Stahlman hit me? 
1870,WILLIAMS: Is the Director still in there? 
1871,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1872,SHAW: Why didn't he come out with you? 
1873,DOCTOR: I think he likes it in there. 
1874,GREG: The main coolant valve's seized. I can't flood the drill head
1875,area. 
1876,WILLIAMS: We've got to get the Director out. 
1877,"DOCTOR: Yes, not to mention those technicians. "
1878,"GREG: Right, let's have another go. "
1879,(The blast doors are closing.) 
1880,"GREG: Oh, what the heck's going on? Well, that's crazy! "
1881,WILLIAMS: They've closed it from the inside. Bypassed the control and
1882,locked down on manual! 
1883,"(At the drill head, Stahlman drags a technician to the drill itself and"
1884,rubs his face in the green ooze.) 
1885,SHAW: What does it say? 
1886,(The Doctor and Greg are out of their environment suits. The Doctor is
1887,reading the computer printout.) 
1888,"DOCTOR: Very little now, I'm afraid. Tell me Mister Sutton, how thick"
1889,are those walls? 
1890,"GREG: Thick enough. ferrous concrete, steel plating, asbestos sheeting,"
1891,the lot. It could stand up to an atomic blast. 
1892,"DOCTOR: Compared to the forces that you people have unleashed, an"
1893,atomic blast would be like a summer breeze. 
1894,"(And as if to prove it, we see more parts of the complex with thick red"
1895,smoke pouring out. Stewart and Shaw enter.) 
1896,DOCTOR: What's going on out there? 
1897,STEWART: The technicians and staff have got away. Most of my security
1898,guards have gone with them. 
1899,GREG: Perhaps they're the sensible ones. 
1900,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, they'll be no better off in the long run, wherever"
1901,they go. 
1902,"WILLIAMS: Doctor, I'm afraid the computer's finally broken down. "
1903,STEWART: It is your duty to remain. 
1904,SHAW: That's correct. 
1905,"DOCTOR: Well, the heat will have fused the main circuits. I'll have a"
1906,look. 
1907,WILLIAMS: Brigade Leader? 
1908,"STEWART: Yes, Doctor Williams? "
1909,WILLIAMS: Any news from London yet? 
1910,STEWART: Massive seismic disturbances reported throughout the country.
1911,Earth tremors reported in the Midlands and as far north as Leeds. 
1912,GREG: Just what are the authorities doing? 
1913,SHAW: They've ordered an immediate evacuation of the area except for
1914,essential personnel. The Brigade Leader is to assume executive control.
1915,
1916,GREG: Anything else? 
1917,"SHAW: No, after that the line went dead. "
1918,GREG: So they're abandoning us. They're not even going to try and seal
1919,the shaft. 
1920,SHAW: They believe that the emergency will eventually pass over. 
1921,"GREG: Well, the Doctor doesn't seem to think so. "
1922,"STEWART: Oh, who cares what he thinks. "
1923,GREG: I do. He talks a lot of good sense! Doctor? 
1924,DOCTOR: Yes? 
1925,GREG: Surely there must be some way of sealing the shaft? Why don't the
1926,government evacuate us all and blow up the whole area? 
1927,"DOCTOR: Too late, Mister Sutton. You've unleashed the energies of the"
1928,Earth's core. 
1929,"GREG: All right, but we must cap the bore somehow. "
1930,DOCTOR: No substance on this Earth is strong enough to withstand those
1931,pressures. 
1932,"GREG: Okay, so what's going to happen? "
1933,"STEWART: Well, Doctor, what is going to happen? "
1934,"DOCTOR: Well, the heat and the pressures'll continue to build up until"
1935,"the Earth dissolves in a fury of expanding gasses, just as it was"
1936,billions of years ago. 
1937,SHAW: How long have we got? 
1938,"DOCTOR: Maybe a few weeks, maybe only a few days. "
1939,GREG: So it's Doomsday? We just sit back and wait for it. 
1940,(Green Bromley enters. Everyone goes for cover except the Brigade
1941,"Leader, who draws his pistol.) "
1942,"DOCTOR: Don't go near him, Brigadier! Don't go near him. He's probably"
1943,more interested in getting to the drill head than he is in us. 
1944,(But the Brigade Leader still shoots at Bromley as he makes his way
1945,across the floor of the control room. But before Bromley can get to the
1946,"soldier, the Doctor uses a CO2 extinguisher on him.) "
1947,DOCTOR: Oh. He seems to be dead this time. 
1948,STEWART: Rather surprising. 
1949,"DOCTOR: It wasn't just your bullets that killed him, you know. "
1950,STEWART: The fire extinguisher? 
1951,"DOCTOR: Yes, the fire extinguisher. They can't stand cold. "
1952,"GREG: Well, that's enough for me. There's no point in us hanging around"
1953,any longer. 
1954,STEWART: If you're thinking of deserting. 
1955,GREG: Evacuating is the word. If I've only got a little time left to
1956,"live, I'm going to spend it as far away from this place as I can get! "
1957,SHAW: We were ordered to remain here. 
1958,STEWART: And that's exactly what we're going to do. 
1959,GREG: You speak for yourself! 
1960,"STEWART: You still have a job to do here, Sutton! "
1961,"GREG: You just don't listen, do you? You heard what he said. There's"
1962,"nothing we can do. Is that right, Doctor? "
1963,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid so. "
1964,"GREG: Well, I'm clearing out! Coming, Petra? "
1965,STEWART: You will stay here and do your duty! 
1966,GREG: You're still loyal to your glorious republic. I'd like to know
1967,what your precious dictator can do for you now. 
1968,STEWART: I will not listen to treason! 
1969,"DOCTOR: Gentlemen, stop arguing. Just save your energy. "
1970,"GREG: For what? We're all under sentence of death. Oh, come on, Petra. "
1971,"BENTON 2: I've managed to round up a few of the men, Leader. "
1972,STEWART: Good. Post them outside. No one is to leave this building
1973,"without my permission. No one, Benton! "
1974,"BENTON 2: Understood, Leader. "
1975,"GREG: You know it's marvellous, isn't it? The world's going up in flame"

1989,GREG: You heard what the Doctor said. The heat will have fused the main
1990,circuits. 
1991,WILLIAMS: The Doctor has no control here. 
1992,GREG: You could have fooled me. 
1993,WILLIAMS: It's not his responsibility. 
1994,"GREG: Maybe not, but he's the only one who seems to know what's going"
1995,on. 
1996,"WILLIAMS: Thank you, Mister Sutton. "
1997,"GREG: Oh, I'm not getting at you, but if the Doctor's right, you're"
1998,wasting your time. 
1999,"WILLIAMS: Look, if I can get this computer working again, it might give"
2000,us the solution. 
2001,"GREG: Still hasn't sunk in, has it? There is no solution! The whole"
2002,place is going to blow up. 
2003,WILLIAMS: The whole system needs rewiring. 
2004,GREG: And no one is being allowed in or out of this place. Do you get
2005,the point now? 
2006,WILLIAMS: What point? 
2007,GREG: Those blokes in London know it's no use. If they thought there
2008,"was any chance, this place would be crawling with experts. You'd have"
2009,as much equipment as you need. 
2010,WILLIAMS: It might be on its way. 
2011,GREG: Nothing's on its way! We've been left here to die. 
2012,WILLIAMS: I don't believe that. 
2013,"GREG: Oh yes, you do. Because it's logical. They're scared to let us"
2014,out of here because we'll increase the panic. 
2015,WILLIAMS: They wouldn't just abandon us. They'd evacuate us if things
2016,got too dangerous. 
2017,GREG: Maybe you're right. Let's hope so. 
2018,"WILLIAMS: You really think this is the end, don't you? "
2019,GREG: It could be. 
2020,WILLIAMS: We're just going to die in here. I can't take it in. 
2021,(Greg puts his arm around her.) 
2022,"GREG: Look, I'm sorry but there are times when it's better to face the"
2023,truth. 
2024,"WILLIAMS: Oh, Greg, I'm frightened! "
2025,(They embrace.) 
2026,WILLIAMS: What can we do? 
2027,"GREG: Well, the question really is, what you're going to do. "
2028,WILLIAMS: What do you mean? 
2029,"GREG: Well, I'm going to get out of here. I could do with some help"
2030,from you. 
2031,WILLIAMS: From me? 
2032,"GREG: Well, what about it? Are you going to be a nice well-behaved"
2033,little zombie or are you going to join the rebels?

2041,"DOCTOR: Not this one, Elizabeth. The other one. "
2042,"STEWART: Even now, you stick to this absurd story. "
2043,"DOCTOR: This other world exists, Brigade Leader. It's as true as the"
2044,one you know yourselves. 
2045,SHAW: And we're all somehow duplicated there? 
2046,"DOCTOR: Yes. You, the Brigade Leader, Stahlman, Sutton, Petra, all of"
2047,you. You could save your other selves. 
2048,SHAW: Save them? How? 
2049,DOCTOR: With the aid of the Tardis. 
2050,STEWART: Tardis? 
2051,SHAW: You mean that odd-looking contraption we found in the hut? 
2052,DOCTOR: Yes. 
2053,SHAW: Could it take you back? 
2054,"DOCTOR: Yes, possibly. If I could use your nuclear reactor for power. "
2055,"SHAW: But if this other world is parallel, they'll be in same situation"
2056,as us. 
2057,DOCTOR: Not necessarily. Work on their project is not so advanced as
2058,yours. I may be able to stop them before they penetrate the Earth's
2059,crust.

2071,a bunch of trigger-happy thugs. 
2072,WILLIAMS: They might let us through.

2080,here in this? 
2081,DOCTOR: That's right. 
2082,SHAW: But this isn't a vehicle at all. 
2083,"DOCTOR: No, but she's a very important part of one. "
2084,STEWART: And where's the rest of it? 
2085,"DOCTOR: Back in the world where I came from. I, er, I removed the"
2086,console to make some trial runs. 
2087,(The Doctor powers up the console.) 
2088,"STEWART: Well, what's happening? "
2089,SHAW: You said you needed a power source to make this thing work. 
2090,DOCTOR: There's always a certain amount of energy left in the storage
2091,unit. 
2092,STEWART: I think we've seen enough of this nonsense. Come on. 
2093,DOCTOR: You said you were going to help me. 
2094,STEWART: I said nothing of the kind. This contraption is obviously
2095,incapable of taking anyone anywhere. We shall return to Central
2096,Control. 
2097,DOCTOR: If you'd only try and use the little intelligence you have. 
2098,STEWART: I've no time for fairy stories. 
2099,"SHAW: If you could give us some proof, Doctor. A demonstration. "
2100,"DOCTOR: Proof? Demonstration? What do you think I am, a conjuror? Have"
2101,"can I give you a demonstration when I haven't got. Now, wait a minute. "
2102,STEWART: Well? 
2103,"DOCTOR: If I'm to do it, I'll drain the storage unit completely. Very"
2104,"well, you shall have your demonstration. "
2105,(The Doctor activates the console and he dematerialises with it.) 
2106,STEWART: Doctor? Doctor? 
2107,(And rematerialises.) 
2108,"DOCTOR: Well, are you satisfied? Or do you think it was all done with"
2109,mirrors? 
2110,SHAW: What happened? Where were you? 
2111,DOCTOR: Just a pitiful few seconds into the future. I only wish it
2112,could have been more. 
2113,STEWART: Stay away from that! 
2114,"DOCTOR: Don't be a fool, man. I can't possibly go anywhere. The storage"
2115,unit is completely flat. 
2116,"STEWART: If the power was connected, you could make the journey back? "
2117,DOCTOR: Perhaps. 
2118,STEWART: And take others with you. 
2119,"DOCTOR: No! No, I couldn't possibly do that. "
2120,SHAW: Why not?

2182,out a red wire. The blast door closes. The Greens rush over to it.)

2194,done. 
2195,"GREG: Well not now, there isn't. He's probably been killed by those"
2196,things! 
2197,"DOCTOR: Worse than that, he'll have become one of them. The heat will"
2198,accelerate the process. 
2199,"GREG: Well, why did you cut them off from the drill head? "
2200,"DOCTOR: To keep them away from the heat. The hotter it is, the stronger"
2201,they grow. 
2202,"GREG: Well, if it gets any hotter in here, they won't have to attack."
2203,We'll just shrivel up. 
2204,"STEWART: Well, Doctor, it doesn't look as though your space craft is"
2205,going to be much good to anybody now. 
2206,GREG: Space craft? 
2207,WILLIAMS: What are they talking about?

2209,here. 
2210,"STEWART: Only the Doctor, of course. Not the rest of us. "

2225,"PATTERSON: Are they going to slow down the drilling, sir? "
2226,"GOLD: They're going to suspend it, pending a full review of the"

2228,"All right, Patterson, what's going on? "
2229,"PATTERSON: I'm sorry, sir. I don't understand. "

2234,GOLD: Was I ever supposed to get back from the Ministry? 
2235,"PATTERSON: Not if you were successful, sir. I was to drive as far off"

2240,behind me. 
2241,"PATTERSON: Yes, sir. "
2242,GOLD: All right. If you can break all records getting back to the
2243,"complex, I might just forget about all this. "

2279,SHAW: How long have we got? 
2280,DOCTOR: I should say all of ten minutes. 
2281,GREG: You said you had a plan just now. What is it? 
2282,"DOCTOR: Well, if we're going to get power to the Tardis console, we'll"
2283,have to connect it up to the nuclear reactor. 
2284,WILLIAMS: That's if there's any power left. 
2285,(The Doctor holds his handkerchief up in front of the air conditioning

2287,SHAW: What are you doing? 
2288,"DOCTOR: Well, the air conditioning's still working, so power's still"
2289,getting through. 
2290,WILLIAMS: Only the bare minimum. The reactor must still be working off
2291,robot control. 
2292,DOCTOR: Can you boost the output? 
2293,"WILLIAMS: Well, in an emergency, the master switch automatically shuts"
2294,down the reactor banks. 
2295,DOCTOR: But it can be re-set? 
2296,WILLIAMS: It would take time. And after that I'd still have to get to
2297,the main switch room at the reactor. 
2298,GREG: The master switch is in Central Control. How do we get through
2299,that lot? 
2300,"DOCTOR: Well, we've still got a weapon to use against them. "
2301,SHAW: You mean the pistol? 
2302,"DOCTOR: No, I don't. I mean the fire extinguisher. "
2303,SHAW: You can't hold them off with that thing for very long. 
2304,"WILLIAMS: If that master switch has been damaged, it'll be a long job"
2305,resetting it. 
2306,"DOCTOR: Well, there are other fire extinguishers in Central Control. "
2307,GREG: If we can get to them. Wait a minute! I'm a fool. Of course! The
2308,coolant reserve. I've rigged up an emergency hose. 
2309,"WILLIAMS: That's it! Well, the coolant's under pressure! It's just as"
2310,cold as the CO2 in the fire extinguishers. 
2311,"GREG: Doctor, you've got a monster sized fire extinguisher just waiting"
2312,for you in there. 
2313,"DOCTOR: Splendid. Well, we'll fight our way into Central Control using"

2336,WILLIAMS: Is he dead? 
2337,"DOCTOR: No, I think he's just paralysed. He'll probably come to again"

2603,SHAW: Where's there to go? 
2604,"STEWART: If that spacecraft of the Doctor's works, you'll see for"
2605,yourself. 
2606,SHAW: You don't really think you can force him to take us? He's not the
2607,sort of man you can frighten. 
2608,"STEWART: Once that thing's working, we can take it over. "
2609,SHAW: We don't know how to operate it. 
2610,(BOOM!) 
2611,STEWART: Doctor Williams can learn how to operate it. She's a
2612,scientist! 
2613,SHAW: That device is beyond all our comprehension. 
2614,STEWART: Then I shall have to persuade him to operate it for us. 
2615,SHAW: And if he tries to go by himself? 
2616,STEWART: And leaves us to die? I shall make sure that he dies first.

2633,"WILLIAMS: Oh, it doesn't matter. The power won't flow until he switches"

2778, (The clock reads 3:22:38 and counting.) 
2779,"STAHLMAN: It's perfectly straightforward, Petra. We boost all power"

2783,"PETRA: Of course not, Professor Stahlman. "
2784,"STAHLMAN: Well then, what's the matter? "
2785,PETRA: We're already twelve percent over the planned acceleration.

2800,PETRA: Professor Stahlman's been working on this project for years. He
2801,must know what's going on.

2875,"we're drilling, that flange could blow at any moment. "

3021,(Someone knocks at the door.) 
3022,LIZ: Just a minute. 
3023,(Liz opens the door.) 
3024,DOCTOR: Sir Keith! 
3025,(Gold has his left arm in a sling.) 
3026,"GOLD: My dear fellow, so you've come back to us after all. "
3027,DOCTOR: So you're not dead? 
3028,(LIZ closes the doors.) 
3029,"GOLD: No, I came very close to it though. "
3030,"BRIGADIER: Why, what happened? "
3031,GOLD: Car crash. 
3032,DOCTOR: But you're not dead. 
3033,"BRIGADIER: You can see he's not dead. The Doctor's been ill, sir. "
3034,DOCTOR: That's excellent! Excellent! 
3035,"GOLD: Well, yes, yes, I think so too. Brigadier, I shall have to lay"
3036,very serious charges against Professor Stahlman. He ordered my
3037,chauffeur to delay my return. 
3038,DOCTOR: So not everything runs parallel. 
3039,"GOLD: He's been ill, you said? "
3040,"BRIGADIER: Yes, a coma. "
3041,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course, of course. An infinity of universes, ergo an"
3042,infinite number of choices. So free will is not an illusion after all.
3043,The pattern can be changed. 
3044,"BRIGADIER: (into phone) Hello, get me the medical section will you?"
3045,Thank you. 
3046,DOCTOR: Now look. 
3047,"BRIGADIER: Yes, very well. "
3048,"DOCTOR: Now, wait a minute. I'm not sick, I'm not in need of a doctor"
3049,and I'm not a raving idiot! 
3050,(The Doctor slams the phone down.) 
3051,"BRIGADIER: No, no, no, of course not. Perhaps you've had some sort of"
3052,nightmare. 
3053,LIZ: He did disappear. We saw him. 
3054,"DOCTOR: Sir Keith, unless we do something very, very quickly indeed,"
3055,there's going to be a disaster. 
3056,"GOLD: How do you know, Doctor? "
3057,DOCTOR: Because I've already seen it.

3059, [Central Control]
3060,
3061, DOCTOR: Professor Stahlman? You must stop this
3062,drilling immediately! 
3063,STAHLMAN: Who let this maniac back in here? 
3064,DOCTOR: Do you hear me? Close down this operation now! 
3065,"STAHLMAN: Brigadier, arrest this man. "
3066,"DOCTOR: Now listen to me, all of you! You are not to attempt to"
3067,penetrate the Earth's crust! 
3068,"STAHLMAN: Brigadier, did you hear what I say? "
3069,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, please? "
3070,DOCTOR: Get out of my light! Now stop this drilling! 
3071,(The Doctor attacks a console with a wrench.) 
3072,LIZ: Doctor! 
3073,"DOCTOR: Stop this drilling! You don't understand, do you? "
3074,"BRIGADIER: Benton, get some help, quickly! "
3075,DOCTOR: You've got stop this drilling! 
3076,"SUTTON: Now Doctor, calm down! "
3077,STAHLMAN: You see? Completely demented. 
3078,DOCTOR: Stop this drilling! 
3079,(Soldiers grab the Doctor's arms.) 
3080,BRIGADIER: Take him to the sick bay. Be careful. I don't want him hurt.
3081,
3082,"LIZ: No, you can't! "
3083,"DOCTOR: Now Liz, listen to me. Computer. There's a micro circuit"
3084,missing. 
3085,LIZ: I'll look. Will you treat him carefully? 
3086,(The Doctor is hustled away.) 
3087,DOCTOR : Stop it! Stop this drilling! 
3088,"STAHLMAN: Brigadier, I hold you responsible. "
3089,"GOLD: Professor Stahlman, I'd like to speak to you please. "
3090,"STAHLMAN: Ah, Sir Keith. I thought you were supposed to be in London."
3091,An accident? 
3092,GOLD: This is a direct consequence of your orders to my chauffeur. 
3093,STAHLMAN: Hmm? Huh! Ridiculous. 
3094,"GOLD: Professor, the Minister would like you to report to him"
3095,"immediately, please. "
3096,"STAHLMAN: Oh, he would, would he? "
3097,"GOLD: There's to be an inquiry into this project and, if I may say so,"
3098,into your conduct. 
3099,"STAHLMAN: You can make as many inquiries as you like, my dear Gold,"
3100,after we've penetrated the Earth's crust.

3104," PETRA: Professor Stahlman, I'll be switching to"
3105,robot controls in forty nine minutes. 
3106,STAHLMAN: Thank you. 
3107,"PETRA: Any wrong, Professor? "
3108,STAHLMAN: I feel very cold in here. 
3109,PETRA: Cold? 
3110,STAHLMAN: Yes. Have the maintenance people raise the temperature. 
3111,PETRA: But it's running normally. 
3112,STAHLMAN: Do as I say. 
3113,"(Petra leaves. Stahlman tenses and stares at nothing, whilst hearing"
3114,something. The technicians stare.) 
3115,STAHLMAN: All of you leave this area immediately! Go on! I shall
3116,control the last phase of this operation alone. Stand by in the drill
3117,"head there. Now, go on! Get out, all of you. Go on. Do as I say. "
3118,"(Once alone, he clutches his head in pain.)"

3121,
3122, SUTTON: He's just ordered them all out of there.
3123,Now do you believe he's cracked up? 
3124,"PETRA: Greg, the heat shield! "
3125,(The shield slides down to close off the drill head.)

3128,
3129," DOCTOR: Well, I'm sorry about this, gentlemen. "
3130,(The Doctor grabs the back of the necks of his two escorts. They
3131,"collapse, he runs, then heads up a ladder, only to find Green Bromley"
3132,on the top of the storage tank too. The Doctor grabs a CO2 fire
3133,extinguisher and uses it.)
3134,
3135, [Central Control]
3136,
3137, (Green ooze is coming out of number two output
3138,"pipe. Stahlman puts his green, hairy hand into it then smears it on his"
3139,face before falling to the floor growling like an animal. His voice
3140,comes over the comms.) 
3141,PETRA: Professor Stahlman! Please! What's happening? What's going on in
3142,there? 
3143,GOLD: Why don't you raise the heat shield? 
3144,SUTTON: Because he's locked it down on manual from the inside. 
3145,(Stahlman now has a full hairy face and fangs.)
3146,
3147, [Central Control]
3148,
3149, (Liz has mended the computer and is reading the
3150,printout.) 
3151,SUTTON: What does the thing say now? 
3152,"COMPUTER: Zero minus two minutes, fifty seconds. "
3153,LIZ: The Doctor's right. It advises us to stop the drilling at once. 
3154,COMPUTER: Robot control now operational. 
3155,"SUTTON: Why don't you give the order, Sir Keith? "
3156,"GOLD: Oh, I can't. The order to close down must come from the"
3157,Professor. I have no authority to intervene. 
3158,"COMPUTER: Zero minus two minutes, forty seconds "
3159,(The Doctor enters.) 
3160,DOCTOR: Where's Stahlman? 
3161,LIZ: He's locked himself in there! 
3162,COMPUTER: To final build up.Â 
3163,"DOCTOR: Good. Then stop this infernal drilling. Well, what are you"
3164,waiting for?!Â 
3165,"COMPUTER: Zero minus two minutes, thirty seconds "
3166,DOCTOR: Stop this drilling and start filling up that shaft! 
3167,"GOLD: The data from the computer isn't conclusive, Doctor, nor is"
3168,Stahlman's behaviour. We have no proof of an emergency situation. 
3169,(The heat shield rises.)

3171,now on stand by. 
3172,(Green Stahlman rushes in.)

3174,"DOCTOR: Stahlman, get back! Sutton, the fire extinguishers! "
3175,"(As the Doctor turns to get an extinguisher, Green Stahlman raises a"
3176,chair to hit him. The Brigadier shoots.)

3184,"DOCTOR: Petra, the drill. Close it down. "
3185,COMPUTER: Zero minus one minute fifty seconds. 
3186,GOLD: Cut off the nuclear power. 
3187,PETRA: But the drill will disintegrate! 
3188,SUTTON: All the better!

3202,BRIGADIER: But it's still going on! 
3203,"COMPUTER: Zero minus one minute, twenty seconds. "
3204,DOCTOR: That's the buffer controls at the drill head. Come on! 
3205,COMPUTER: Non-technical staff to safety positions. 
3206,BRIGADIER: Buffer controls? 
3207,"GOLD: Oh, they it slow down by stages. It'll keep going for at least"
3208,five minutes.

3236,(Liz hugs the Doctor as Petra hugs Sutton.) 
3237,"DOCTOR: Sir Keith, I think you'd better give orders for that shaft to"
3238,be filled in straight away. 
3239,"GOLD: Indeed, I will. "
3240,BRIGADIER: I'll send for a stretcher party.

3246,"DOCTOR: Shine on Martian moons, up in the sky. Join in. Liz, come on. "
3247,(Someone knocks on the door. Liz goes to let them in.) 
3248,"DOCTOR: Shine on, shine on, Martian moon. "
3249,"GOLD: Sorry to disturb you, Doctor. I just popped in to say goodbye. "
3250,"DOCTOR: Oh, are you leaving, Sir Keith? "
3251,GOLD: Everyone is. 
3252,BRIGADIER: Word came through this morning. This project is being
3253,officially abandoned. 
3254,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm not sorry to hear that. What about the nuclear"
3255,reactor? 
3256,GOLD: They're dismantling it tomorrow. 
3257,"DOCTOR: Oh, but there's time for me to use it just once more, I hope? "
3258,"GOLD: Oh, yes, of course, with pleasure. It's the least we can do. "
3259,"DOCTOR: Thank you, Sir Keith. By the way, how's Sutton and Miss"
3260,Williams? 
3261,"GOLD: Oh, they've left already. "
3262,LIZ: Together? 
3263,"GOLD: Well, I believe he is driving her to London in his car. "
3264,"DOCTOR: Nothing like a nice happy ending, is there? "
3265,"GOLD: No. Well, goodbye, Doctor. "
3266,"DOCTOR: Goodbye, Sir Keith. "
3267,"GOLD: Goodbye, Miss Shaw. "
3268,"LIZ: Bye bye, Sir Keith. "
3269,"DOCTOR: Goodbye, Brigadier. "
3270,"BRIGADIER: Oh, there's quite a lot of mopping up to do. I shall be"
3271,around for quite a while yet. 
3272,(Gold leaves.) 
3273,"DOCTOR: Oh, pity. Well, come on, Liz. If we've going to link up to that"
3274,"nuclear reactor, we'd better get a move on. "
3275,"LIZ: Now, just a moment, Doctor. "
3276,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, you're not still tinkering with this machine after"
3277,all the trouble it's caused us? 
3278,DOCTOR: The trouble it's caused you? 
3279,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, if you hadn't chosen such a crucial moment to"
3280,"disappear, this whole business might have been cleared up a great deal"
3281,sooner. 
3282,"LIZ: Well, he did try to warn everybody, Brigadier. "
3283,DOCTOR: And a fat lot of notice you all took. 
3284,"BRIGADIER: So, you went gallivanting off in a fit of pique. "
3285,"DOCTOR: Brigadier, there are times when you strongly remind me of your"
3286,other self. I shall leave at once. 
3287,LIZ: In the Tardis console? 
3288,DOCTOR: Naturally. 
3289,"LIZ: Oh, but Doctor, you can't. "
3290,(The Doctor throws the main power breakers.) 
3291,"DOCTOR: With the work that we did today, the Tardis console is now"
3292,fully operational. 
3293,BRIGADIER: We seem to have heard that before. 
3294,"DOCTOR: Goodbye, Liz. I shall miss you, my dear. But I've had about all"
3295,"I can stand of this pompous, self-opinionated idiot here. "
3296,(The Doctor and the console vanish.) 
3297,LIZ: Now see what you've done. 
3298,"BRIGADIER: Well, I didn't know he'd go off like that. The man's so"
3299,infernally touchy. 
3300,"LIZ: Well, I shall be most interested to see how you get on without"
3301,"him, Brigadier. "
3302,"BRIGADIER: May I remind you, Miss Shaw, that you're still a serving"
3303,member of UNIT? I don't entirely care for your tone. 
3304,LIZ: I don't much care for yours either. No wonder the Doctor cleared
3305,off. 
3306,(There is an cough from the open doorway. There are stains on the
3307,Doctor's jacket.) 
3308,BRIGADIER: Welcome back. 
3309,LIZ: Where did you go? 
3310,"DOCTOR: A few seconds forward in time, and a few hundred yards due east"
3311,in space. 
3312,LIZ: The rubbish tip? 
3313,DOCTOR: The rubbish tip. 
3314,"LIZ: Oh, dear. "
3315,"DOCTOR: Er, Brigadier, my dear fellow, I wonder whether I could borrow"
3316,a couple of your stalwart chaps to give me a hand in bringing the
3317,Tardis back? It's landed in rather an inaccessible position. 
3318,"BRIGADIER: Pompous, self-opinionated idiot, I believe you said, Doctor?"
3319,
3320,"DOCTOR: Yes, well we don't want to bear a grudge for a few hasty words,"
3321,"do we? No, not after all the years that we've worked together. Now come"
3322,"long, my dear fellow, put on a smile. Just remember all "
3323,(Liz laughs as the Doctor leads the Brigadier out.)
