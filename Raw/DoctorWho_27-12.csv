22,
23,DOCTOR: What is it? What's happening? 
24,(The Doctor falls out of a small spinning cupboard.) 
25,"LYNDA: Oh, my God! I don't believe it! Why'd they put you in there?"
26,They never said you were coming. 
27,DOCTOR: What happened? I was. 
28,"LYNDA: Careful now. Oh! Oh, mind yourself! Oh, that's the transmat. It"
29,"scrambles your head. I was sick for days. All right? So, what's your"
30,"name then, sweetheart? "
31,(The Doctor is very unsteady.) 
32,"DOCTOR: The Doctor, I think. I was, er. I don't know, what happened?"
33,How 
34,LYNDA: You got chosen. 
35,DOCTOR: Chosen for what? 
36,LYNDA: You're a housemate. You're in the house. Isn't that brilliant?! 
37,"(Over by a pink screen with a stylised eye on it, a young man in a"
38,t-shirt is not amused.) 
39,STROOD: That's not fair. We've got eviction in five minutes! I've been
40,"here for all nine weeks, I've followed the rules, I haven't had a"
41,"single warning, and then he comes swanning in. "
42,(The dark-skinned young lady in the pink shirt joins in.) 
43,"CROSBIE: If they keep changing the rules, I'm going to protest, I am."
44,"You watch me, I'm going to paint the walls. "
45,DAVINA : Would the Doctor please come to the Diary Room?

50,eye on it and sits in a comfy chair.)

57,(Rose wakes up on a studio floor. A dark-skinned
58,man is bending over her.) 
59,ROSE: What happened? 
60,RODRICK: It's all right. It's the transmat. Does your head in. Get a
61,bit of amnesia. What's your name? 
62,ROSE: Rose. But where's the Doctor? 
63,RODRICK: Just remember do what the android says. Don't provoke it. The
64,android's word is law. 
65,"ROSE: What do you mean, android? Like a robot? "
66,(A woman calls out instructions.) 
67,"FLOOR MANAGER : Positions, everyone! Thank you! "
68,"RODRICK: Come on, hurry up. Steady, steady. "
69,"(Rodrick helps Rose up. She is wobbly on her feet, too.) "
70,"ROSE: I was travelling, with the Doctor and a man called Captain Jack."
71,The Doctor wouldn't just leave me. 
72,FLOOR MANAGER : That's enough chat. Positions! Final call! Good
73,luck! 
74,ROSE: But I'm not supposed to be here. 
75,RODRICK: It says Rose on the podium. Come on. 
76,(Rose takes her place next to Rodrick.) 
77,"ROSE: Hold on, I must be going mad. It can't be. This looks like the "
78,FLOOR MANAGER: Android activated!

81,[What Not To Wear]
82,
83,TRINE-E: Here we go again. We've got our work cut
84,out for us. 
85,ZU-ZANA: I don't know. He's sort of handsome. Has a good lantern jaw. 
86,TRINE-E: Lantern jaws are so last year. 
87,"(Another pair of droids - one tall and thin, one short and curvy - have"
88,Jack lying on an examination couch. There is a rack of clothes nearby.)
89,
90,"JACK: Sorry, but, nice to meet you, ladies, but where exactly am I? "
91,TRINE-E: We're giving you a brand new image. 
92,"JACK: Oh, hold on, I was with the Doctor. Why, is there something wrong"
93,with what I'm wearing? 
94,ZU-ZANA: It's all very twentieth century. Where did you get that denim?
95,
96,JACK: A little place in Cardiff. It was called the Top Shop. 
97,ZU-ZANA: Ah! Design classic. 
98,TRINE-E: But we're going to have to find you some new colours. Maybe
99,get rid of that Oklahoma Farm Boy thing you've got going on. 
100,ZU-ZANA: Just stand still and let the Defabricator work its magic. 
101,JACK: What's a defabricator? 
102,"(It's a beam that disintegrates all, yes all, your clothes.) "
103,JACK: Okay. Defabricator. Does exactly what it says on the tin. Am I
104,naked in front of millions of viewers? 
105,(Thank goodness for the strategically placed Defabricator.) 
106,TRINE-E + ZU-ZANA: Absolutely! 
107,"JACK: Ladies, your viewing figures just went up. "

109,
110,(The Doctor is checking his surroundings with the
111,sonic screwdriver.) 
112,DOCTOR: I can't open it. 
113,"LYNDA: It's got a deadlock seal, ever since Big Brother five hundred"
114,and four when they all walked out. You must remember that. 
115,DOCTOR: What about this? 
116,(An alcove with a picture in it.) 
117,"LYNDA: Oh, that's exoglass. You'd need a nuclear bomb to get through. "
118,DOCTOR: Don't tempt me. 
119,"LYNDA: I know you're not supposed to talk about the outside world, but"
120,"you must've been watching. Do people like me? Lynda. Lynda with a Y,"
121,not Linda with an I. She got forcibly evicted because she damaged the
122,camera. Am I popular? 
123,DOCTOR: I don't remember. 
124,"LYNDA: Oh, but does that mean I'm nothing? Some people get this far"
125,just because they're insignificant. Doesn't anybody notice me? 
126,"DOCTOR: No, you're, you're nice. You're sweet. Everybody thinks you're"
127,sweet. 
128,"LYNDA: Oh, is that right? Is that what I am? Oh, no one's ever told me"
129,that before. Am I sweet? Really? 
130,DOCTOR: Yeah. Dead sweet. 
131,LYNDA: Thank you. 
132,DOCTOR: It's a wall. Isn't there supposed to be a garden out there or
133,something? 
134,LYNDA: Don't be daft. No one's got a garden anymore. Who's got a
135,garden? Don't tell me you've got a garden. 
136,"DOCTOR: No, I've just got the Tardis. I remember. "
137,LYNDA: That's the amnesia! So what happened? Where did they get you? 
138,DOCTOR: We'd just left Raxacoriofallapatorius. Then we went to Kyoto.
139,"That's right, Japan in 1336, and we only just escaped."
140,
141,[Tardis]
142,
143,"DOCTOR : We were together, we were laughing,"
144,and then there was this light. This white light coming through the

146,
147,[Big Brother House]
148,
149,DOCTOR: And then I woke up here. 
150,"LYNDA: Yeah, that's the transmat beam. That's how they pick the"
151,housemates. 
152,"DOCTOR: Oh, Lynda with a Y. Sweet little Lynda. It's worse than that."
153,I'm not just a passing traveller. No stupid little transmat gets inside
154,"my ship. That beam was fifteen million times more powerful, which means"
155,this isn't just a game. There's something else going on. 
156,"(The Doctor speaks into one of the Eyes on the walls, which are cameras"
157,of course.) 
158,"DOCTOR: Well, here's the latest update from the Big Brother house. I'm"
159,"getting out. I'm going to find my friends, and then I'm going to find"

184,comes after Hoob? 
185,FITCH: (a woman) Is it Clavadoe?

187,ROSE: One hundred! 
188,ANNE DROID: Correct. Rodrick.

211,"ANNE DROID : No, the correct answer is Lord Drayvole. "
212,WOMAN: Why's she laughing? 
213,"ANNE DROID : Rodrick: in maths, what is nine squared? "
214,"WOMAN: Oh, my God, I don't think she knows. "

219,
220,(Jack is posing.) 
221,TRINE- E: It's the buccaneer look. Little dash of pirate and just a
222,tweak of President Schwarzenegger. 
223,"JACK: Er, not sure about the vest. What about a little bit of colour to"
224,lift it? 
225,ZU-ZANA: Absolutely not. Never wear black with colour. It makes the
226,"colour look cheap and the black look boring. Now, let's talk jackets. "
227,JACK: I kind of like the first one. 
228,"ZU-ZANA: No, that's a bit too much Hell's Angel. I think I like the"
229,"shorter one. Look, waist length, nice and slimming, shows off the bum. "
230,JACK: Works for me. 
231,"TRINE-E: Once we've got an outfit, we can look at the face. Ever"
232,thought about cosmetic surgery? 
233,"JACK: I've considered it, yeah. A little lift around the eyes. tighten"
234,up the jaw line. what do you think?

241,(The contestants are choosing the weakest link of
242,the round.) 
243,"ANNE DROID: So, Rose, what do you actually do? "
244,"ROSE: I just travel about a bit. Bit of a tourist, I suppose. "
245,ANNE DROID: Another way of saying unemployed. 
246,ROSE: No. 
247,ANNE DROID: Have you got a job? 
248,"ROSE:: Well, not really, no, but "
249,"ANNE DROID: Then you are unemployed. And yet, you've still got enough"
250,money to buy peroxide. Why Fitch? 
251,"ROSE: Er, I think she got a few of the questions wrong, that's all. "
252,"ANNE DROID: Oh, you'd know all about that. "
253,"ROSE: Well, yeah, but I can't vote for myself, so it had to be Fitch."
254,"I'm sorry, that's the game. That's how it works. I had to vote for"
255,someone. 
256,(Fitch is in tears.) 
257,FITCH: Let me try again. It was the lights and everything. I couldn't
258,think. 
259,"ANNE DROID: In fact, with three answers wrong, Broff was the weakest"
260,"link in that round, but it's votes that count. "
261,"FITCH: I'm sorry. Please. Oh God, help me! "
262,ANNE DROID: Fitch you are the weakest link. Goodbye! 
263,(A barrel comes out of Anne's mouth and a beam disintegrates Fitch.) 
264,FLOOR MANAGER: And we've gone to the adverts. Back in three minutes. 
265,ROSE: What's that? What's just happened? 
266,"RODRICK: She was the weakest link, she gets disintegrated. Blasted into"
267,atoms. 
268,"ROSE: But I voted for her. Oh, my. This is sick. All of you, you're"
269,just sick! I'm not playing this. 
270,"BROFF: I'm not playing! I can't do it. I'm not. Please, somebody let me"
271,out of here. 
272,ANNE DROID: You are the weakest link.
273,"(Broff runs across the studio, and gets zapped by Anne.) "

279,"LYNDA: Doctor, they said all the housemates must"
280,gather on the sofa. You've got to. 
281,"DOCTOR: I'm busy getting out, thanks. "
282,"LYNDA: But if you don't obey, then all the housemates get punished. "
283,"DOCTOR: Well, maybe I'll be voted out, then. "
284,"STROOD: How stupid are you? You've only just joined, you're not"
285,eligible.

295,then we're going to get you. 
296,LYNDA: I won't forget you. 
297,CROSBIE: I'm sorry I stole your soap. 
298,"LYNDA: I don't mind, honestly. "
299,STROOD: Thanks for the food. You're a smashing cook. Bless you. 
300,"DAVINA : Crosbie, please leave the Big Brother House. "
301,"(A door to a short white corridor opens, with another door at the far"
302,end.) 
303,"CROSBIE: Bye, then. Bye, Lynda. "
304,LYNDA: Bye. 
305,"(Crosbie and Lynda make an arch, and Crosbie walks through.) "
306,LYNDA: I don't believe it. Crosbie. 
307,DOCTOR: It's only a game show. She'll make a fortune on the outside.
308,"Sell her story, release a record, fitness video, all of that. she'll be"
309,laughing.

315,"LYNDA: Stop it, it's not funny. "
316,"DAVINA : Eviction in five, four, three, two, one. "
317,(A beam comes down from the ceiling and hits Crosbie. After a few
318,"moments, she vanishes in a puff of smoke.) "

323,
324,"PAVALE: No one programmed the transmat, no one"
325,selected the new contestants. It is exactly like those stories. 
326,"WOMAN: Oh, don't start that again. I think you need to take a session"
327,off. 
328,"PAVALE: Well, I would, if you'd take it with me. "
329,WOMAN: And don't start that again either. 
330,"PAVALE: But the rumours go back decades, saying that something's been"
331,hidden up here. Underneath the transmissions. 
332,WOMAN: But the Controller would know. She watches everything. 
333,PAVALE: Maybe she just can't see it. You've got to allow for human
334,error. 
335,"WOMAN: Well, that's your problem, then. (sotto) I don't think she's"
336,been human for years.

342,DOCTOR: Are you insane? You just step right into
343,"the disintegrator? Is it that important, getting your face on the"
344,telly? Is it worth dying for? 
345,LYNDA: You're talking like we've got a choice! 
346,DOCTOR: But I thought you had to apply. 
347,STROOD: Don't be so stupid. That's how they played it centuries back. 
348,LYNDA: You get chosen whether you like it or not. Everyone on Earth is
349,a potential contestant. The transmat beam picks you out at random. And
350,it's non stop. There are sixty Big Brother houses running all at once. 
351,DOCTOR: How many? Sixty? 
352,STROOD: They've had to cut back. It's not what it was. 
353,DOCTOR: It's a charnel house! What about the winners? What do they get?
354,
355,LYNDA: They get to live. 
356,DOCTOR: Is that it? 
357,"LYNDA: Well, isn't that enough? "
358,DOCTOR: Rose is out there. She got caught in the transmat. She's a
359,"contestant. Time I got out. That other contestant, er, Linda with an I."

370,"ZU-ZANA: Stage two, ready and waiting. "
371,"JACK: Bring it on, girls. "
372,(His clothes are disintegrated.) 
373,TRINE-E: And now it's time for the face off! 
374,JACK: What does that mean? Do I get to compete with someone else? 
375,"TRINE-E: No. Like I said, face off. "
376,(She starts up her chainsaw.) 
377,ZU-ZANA: I think you'd look good with a dog's head. 
378,(A large pair of scissors start up.) 
379,TRINE-E: Or maybe no head at all. That would be so outrageous. 
380,ZU-ZANA: And we could stitch your legs to the middle of your chest. 
381,TRINE-E: Nothing is too extreme. It's to die for. 
382,"JACK: Now, hold on, ladies. I don't want to have to shoot either one of"
383,you. 
384,TRINE-E: But you're unarmed!

400,ROSE: Colleen was clever. She banked all our money. Why'd you vote for
401,her?

403,"know the Princess Vossaheen's surname. When it comes to the final, I"
404,"want to be up against you, so that you get disintegrated and I get a"

407,RODRICK: They're in charge. They run the Game Station. 
408,ROSE: Why are they called Bad Wolf? 
409,RODRICK: I don't know. It's just a name. It's like an Old Earth nursery
