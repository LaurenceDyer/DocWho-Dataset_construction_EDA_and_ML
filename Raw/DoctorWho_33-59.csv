22,(Strax the Sontaran Butler is putting handcuffs on
23,a man.) 
24,"STRAX: Prepare for obliteration, Earthling scum. "
25,"INSPECTOR: Actually, Mister Strax, if you could just take him aside for"
26,"a moment, I have some officers on the way. "
27,STRAX: As you wish. Humans. 
28,JENNY: Sorry. He is new. 
29,"INSPECTOR: Funny looking fellow but, Turkish, is he? "
30,VASTRA: He is a genetically modified clone warrior from outer space. 
31,"INSPECTOR: Ah. Makes sense. Well, what a case. Identical twins, poison"
32,"undetectable to science, an ancient Egyptian curse. Once more Scotland"
33,"Yard is in your debt, Madame Vastra. Where would we be without you? "
34,"VASTRA: Quite some distance from a clue, one imagines. "
35,INSPECTOR: You might be right. Does it ever hurt? 
36,VASTRA: Does what hurt? 
37,INSPECTOR: Your skin condition. Always wondered. 
38,"JENNY: It's not a condition, Inspector. It's just skin. "
39,INSPECTOR: Are you sure? 
40,"VASTRA: I am, as I may have failed to mention, an intelligent reptile"
41,from an ancient civilisation long preceding mankind. Many of us slumber
42,under the Earth's crust. 
43,JENNY: Madame was accidentally awoken by an extension to the London
44,Underground. 
45,"INSPECTOR: Well, that would account for it. "
46,"VASTRA: I was not initially keen on the society of apes, but I made the"
47,most elementary of errors. I fell in love. 
48,(Vastra and Jenny gaze into each others eyes.) 
49,"INSPECTOR: What, with the Turkish fellow? "
50,VASTRA: No. Not with the Turkish fellow. 
51,INSPECTOR: Good lord. Good lord. 
52,"VASTRA: Come along, my dear. "
53,"JENNY: Yes, my darling. "
54,INSPECTOR: Good lord.

59,"JENNY: Still no word from the Doctor, then? "
60,"VASTRA: No, my dear. And there won't be. "
61,JENNY: He can't sulk in his box forever. 
62,VASTRA: Heartbreak is a burden to us all. Pity the man with two. 
63,JENNY: It's starting to snow. 
64,VASTRA: But it can't be. 
65,"JENNY: Well, it is nearly Christmas. "
66,VASTRA: But the clouds. 
67,JENNY: What about them? 
68,VASTRA: There aren't any.
