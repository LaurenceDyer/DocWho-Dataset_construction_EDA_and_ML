19, [Fighter]
20,
21,(A small space fighter is dodging weapons fire and
22,asteroids. It's female pilot has an injured co-pilot.)
23,JOURNEY:
24,"Aristotle, this is Wasp Delta, do you hear me? Stay with me, Kai. Stay"
25,"with me, please. Aristotle! We have been hit. Major damage."
26,Aristotle!
27,(Her enemy is a massive flying saucer.)
28,JOURNEY: Aristotle! The enemy are right on top of us.
29,(The fighter is hit.)
30,JOURNEY: I'm sorry.
31,
32,[Saucer]
33,
34,DALEK: Exterminate. 
35,(A second laser pulse finds its mark. The little fighter explodes as
36,Journey screams.)
37,
38,[Tardis]
39,
40,(Journey
41,opens her eyes to see the brass handles of the console. She sees the
42,"Doctor and scrambles for her hand gun, and keeps it pointing at him.)"
43,"DOCTOR: You'll probably feel a bit sick. Please, don't be."
44,(The Doctor is holding a card tray with two takeaway coffees in it.)
45,JOURNEY: Where's my brother?
46,"DOCTOR: Hello, I'm the Doctor."
47,JOURNEY: He was right beside me. Where's Kai? How did I get here?
48,DOCTOR:
49,I materialised a time capsule exactly round you and saved your life one
50,"second before your ship exploded, but do please keep crying."
51,JOURNEY: My brother's just died.
52,
53,DOCTOR: His sister didn't. You're very welcome. Put the gun down.
54,
55,JOURNEY: Or what? 
56,DOCTOR: Or you might shoot me. Then where will you be?
57,
58,JOURNEY: In charge of your vessel.
59,
60,DOCTOR: You'd starve to death trying to find the light switch. Who are
61,you?
62,JOURNEY:
63,I'm Lieutenant Journey Blue of the Combined Galactic Resistance. I
64,"demand you take me back to my command ship, the Aristotle, which is"
65,currently located
66,
67,"DOCTOR: No. Hey, not like that."
68,
69,"JOURNEY: You will take me back to my command ship,"
70,which is currently positioned
71,"DOCTOR: No, no. Come on. Not like that. Not like that. Get it right"
72,(Journey lowers her gun.)
73,JOURNEY: Will you take me back to my ship? Please?
74,
75,"DOCTOR: The Aristotle's the big fella parked in the asteroid belt,"
76,yeah? 
77,(The Doctor sets the Tardis moving.)
78,JOURNEY: It's shielded.
79,DOCTOR: More or less. 
80,(The Aristotle is hiding by one edge of a long thin asteroid. Journey
81,opens the Tardis door.)
82,"DOCTOR: Dry your eyes, Journey Blue. Crying's for"
83,civilians. It's how we communicate with you lot.
84,
85,
86,[Med Sec 07]
87,
88,(The Tardis has neatly parked
89,herself in a corner of a large section. There are pieces of metal
90,debris and a soldier is driving a small buggy in the background.)
91,JOURNEY: It's smaller on the outside.
92,DOCTOR: It's a bit more exciting when you go the other way. This isn't
93,a battleship. Medical insignia. It's a hospital.
94,
95,(An older man with a greying beard speaks. He is backed up by armed
96,soldiers.)
97,MORGAN: We don't need hospitals now. The Daleks don't leave any
98,"wounded, and we don't take any prisoners."
99,"DOCTOR: I saved your little friend here, if that's in any way relevant"
100,to mention. 
101,"JOURNEY: That's true, sir. He did."
102,
103,MORGAN: Thank you.
104,DOCTOR: You're welcome. I wish I could've done more.
105,
106,MORGAN: Then you should have. 
107,DOCTOR: Okay.
108,"MORGAN: But you did save Journey, and for that I am personally"
109,grateful. 
110,DOCTOR: Well
111,
112,"MORGAN: However, the security of this base is absolute. So we're still"
113,going to kill you.
114,"DOCTOR: Oh, it's a roller coaster with you, isn't it?"
115,
116,"MORGAN: Shoot him, bag him and throw him outside. "
117,JOURNEY: No! Stop!
118,
119,MORGAN: I'm sorry. He might be a duplicate.
120,"JOURNEY: He's a doctor. And we have a patient, don't we, Uncle?"
121,
122,[Corridor]
123,
124,DOCTOR: Why does a hospital need a doctor?
125,MORGAN: The Aristotle wasn't always hidden. The Daleks got here before
126,us.
127,"JOURNEY: You don't like soldiers much, do you?"
128,
129,DOCTOR: You don't need to be liked. You've got all the guns.
130,
131,
132,[Lab 01]
133,
134,(The soldiers stand guard at door 078.)
135,DOCTOR: Wow! A moleculon nanoscaler.
136,(A large clear tube with bench seats down the inside. A bit like a
137,decompression chamber for divers.)
138,"JOURNEY: You know what it does, then?"
139,
140,DOCTOR: It miniaturises living matter. What's the medical
141,"application, though? Do you use it to shrink the surgeons so they can"
142,climb inside the patients? 
143,MORGAN: Exactly.
144,
145,DOCTOR: Fantastic idea for a movie. Terrible idea for a proctologist.
146,Are you going to miniaturise me?
147,
148,"MORGAN: You're a doctor, aren't you? "
149,(He opens a pair of secure doors further along.)
150,MORGAN: And this is your patient.
151,(A scratched eyepiece glows blue.)
152,"DOCTOR: No, you don't understand. You can't put me in there."
153,
154,RUSTY: Doctor?
155,(This is a battered 2005 style Dalek with various cables going into its
156,dome.)
157,
158,[Coal Hill school playground]
159,
160,"(A short haired, dark-skinned man with a neatly"
161,trimmed short beard shouts in the playground.)
162,DANNY: Atten-shun. Look at you lot. I've never seen such a miserable
163,"bunch. What are you, children?"
164,
165,"FLEMING: Yes, sir."
166,
167,(Danny and his troop are wearing matching t-shirts.)
168,"DANNY: You think you're funny, Fleming?"
169,
170,"FLEMING: Yes, sir."
171,
172,"DANNY: All right, me too. "
173,(The school bell rings.)
174,DANNY: Dismissed.
175,
176,(The members of the Coal Hill Cadet Corps run off to the
177,school building.)
178,"BOY: What you doing, Fleming?"
179,
180,(Clara smiles at Danny and follows the children inside.)
181,
182,[Secretary's office]
183,
184,"(A little later, Danny enters, now dressed in shirt and tie, to check"
185,the timetable on the notice board for any changes.)
186,"SECRETARY: So, Mister Pink, did you have a good weekend?"
187,
188,"DANNY: Yeah, I did, thanks. "
189,"SECRETARY: Yeah, I'll bet you did. What did you get up to?"
190,
191,"DANNY: Er, you know. A bit of reading."
192,
193,"SECRETARY: Oh, I bet you were reading."
194,
195,"DANNY: I was, yeah."
196,
197,"SECRETARY: Yeah, I bet you were."
198,
199,"DANNY: Well, yeah, I was."
200,
201,SECRETARY: I know your type.
202,
203,(A schoolgirl is listening at the public counter.)
204,COURTNEY: She wishes.
205,
206,"SECRETARY: Be quiet, you."
207,
208,
209,[Maths classroom]
210,
211,DANNY: So
212,"that's all the questions on page 32, except the last one, and then"
213,everything on page 33. All that in for Thursday. Any questions? 
214,FLEMING: Sir?
215,Have you ever killed a man?
216,
217,(Groans from the rest of the class.)
218,DANNY: I was a soldier.
219,There were other soldiers and some of them weren't on our side. I shall
220,leave the rest to your imagination.
221,"And, please, think of another question?"
222,
223,FLEMING: Okay. Have you ever killed anyone who wasn't a soldier?
224,
225,"DANNY: Just to repeat, that's all the questions on page 32, except"
226,"the last one, and then everything on page 33. All that in for Thursday."
227,Is everyone clear?
228,
229,"CLASS: Yes, sir."
230,
231,(The class watch a lone tear roll down Danny's cheek.)
232,
233,[Staff room]
234,
235,(The staff are putting on their coats to leave. Clara is discussing
236,timetables with the headmaster.)
237,"CLARA: Fine, I'll take that class and then, they can do some of the"
238,test. 
239,ARMITAGE: I know.
240,"Oh, Clara, you've not met Danny Pink yet? New fella, maths."
241,Danny?
242,Clara Oswald. 
243,CLARA: Hey. 
244,ARMITAGE: English.
245,
246,"DANNY: Hey, nice to meet you. "
247,CLARA: You too.
248,
249,ARMITAGE: Want to watch yourself around him.
250,"Bit of a lady-killer, but always denies it."
251,
252,DANNY: I am not a lady-killer.
253,
254,ARMITAGE: See what I mean?
255,"Oh, Beth, can I have a word?"
256,
257,"BETH : Yeah, yeah, sure."
258,
259,"CLARA: Er, was it you that I saw outside doing the soldiery thing?"
260,
261,"DANNY: Ah yeah, probably. The Coal Hill Cadets. Just a bit of fun."
262,
263,"CLARA: What, teaching them how to shoot people?"
264,
265,DANNY: There's a bit more to modern soldiering than just shooting
266,people. I like to think there's a moral dimension. 
267,"CLARA: Ah, you shoot people then cry about it afterwards?"
268,
269,DANNY: Ah.
270,
271,CLARA: Something wrong? 
272,"DANNY: Nothing, no."
273,"Sorry, no, nothing. I just."
274,"I didn't think they'd say anything, that's all. "
275,CLARA: Sorry?
276,
277,DANNY: Have they told everyone?
278,
279,"CLARA: No, no, no. As far as I know, nobody has told anybody anything."
280,What are you talking about?
281,
282,DANNY: Why did you just say the crying thing?
283,
284,CLARA: I was being funny. 
285,DANNY: Why?
286,
287,CLARA: I just do that.
288,
289,DANNY: Why? 
290,CLARA: I don't know.
291,
292,"DANNY: Anyway I, er, I've left some stuff in my class. "
293,"CLARA: Okay, see you. "
294,DANNY: See you.
295,
296,"CLARA: Er, are you going to the, er, leaving thing tonight for Cathy?"
297,
298,DANNY: Um. 
299,
300,[Maths classroom]
301,
302,"DANNY: Yeah. I wasn't going, but I am now, because"
303,"you're going to be there, and suddenly it seems like the best idea"
304,ever.
305,
306,
307,[Staff room]
308,
309,"DANNY: No, I'm not."
310,
311,"CLARA: Oh, okay, never mind."
312,
313,DANNY: Good night.
314,
315,CLARA: Change your mind.
316,
317,DANNY: Excuse me? 
318,"CLARA: I'm going. Er, I'll give you a lift. Why not? "
319,[Maths classroom]
320,
321,"DANNY: Actually, now that you mention it, seems like the best plan"
322,ever. Thank you.
323,
324,
325,[Staff room]
326,
327,"DANNY: No, I've got some reading."
328,
329,"CLARA: Ah, okay. Maybe some other time, then?"
330,
331,
332,[Maths classroom]
333,
334,DANNY: Thank you!
335,(He bangs his forehead on his desk.) 
336,CLARA: Ahem.
337,Is the wooden sound you or or the desk?
338,
339,DANNY: How long have you been there?
340,
341,CLARA: Longer than you would like.
342,
343,DANNY: Okay. 
344,CLARA: Are you going to look that terrified when you take me out for a
345,drink?
346,
347,"DANNY: I, I absolutely promise I won't."
348,
349,CLARA: Play your cards right and you might.
350,
351,[Supply cupboard]
352,
353,(Clara
354,"enters, and nearly walks into the tray of coffees that the Doctor is"
355,holding out to her. The Tardis just fits the width of the back of the
356,cupboard.)
357,CLARA: Where the hell have you been?
358,
359,DOCTOR: You sent me for coffee.
360,
361,CLARA: Three weeks ago. In Glasgow.
362,
363,"DOCTOR: Three weeks, that's a long time."
364,
365,CLARA: In Glasgow. That's dead in a ditch.
366,
367,"DOCTOR: It's not my fault, I got distracted."
368,
369,CLARA: By what? 
370,DOCTOR: You can always find something. Come on. 
371,
372,[Tardis]
373,
374,DOCTOR: Why were you smiling? 
375,CLARA: Was I?
376,"No, I wasn't."
377,
378,"DOCTOR: You were smiling at nothing. I'd almost say you were in love,"
379,but to be honest 
380,CLARA: Honest?
381,
382,DOCTOR: You're not a young woman any more.
383,
384,"CLARA: Yes, I am."
385,
386,(Clara takes the coffees and puts them on the console.)
387,"DOCTOR: Well, you don't look it."
388,
389,CLARA: I do look it.
390,
391,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's right, keep your spirits up,"
392,"Clara, Clara, Clara, Clara. Clara, Clara. Clara, Clara. I need"
393,something from you. I need the truth.
394,
395,"CLARA: Okay. Right, what is it?"
396,What's 
397,(They sit on the console steps.)
398,CLARA: You're scared.
399,
400,DOCTOR: I'm terrified.
401,
402,CLARA: Of what?
403,
404,"DOCTOR: The answer to my next question, which must be honest and cold"
405,"and considered, without kindness or restraint."
406,"Clara, be my pal and tell me, am I a good man?"
407,
408,CLARA: I don't know.
409,
410,DOCTOR: Neither do I.
411,
412,(He gets up and goes to the console.)
413,"CLARA: Er, hey, no offence, but I've got plans."
414,
415,DOCTOR: I need you.
416,
417,CLARA: Right. Where are we going? 
418,(He starts the Tardis flying.)
419,DOCTOR: Into darkness.
420,
421,
422,[Rusty's room]
423,
424,RUSTY: Doctor.
425,DOCTOR: How do you know who I am?
426,
427,MORGAN: He doesn't.
428,We promised him medical assistance.
429,
430,RUSTY: Are you my doctor?
431,
432,JOURNEY: We found it floating in space.
433,
434,"MORGAN: We thought it was deactivated, so we tried to disassemble it."
435,
436,DOCTOR: You didn't realise there was a living creature inside.
437,
438,JOURNEY: Not till it started screaming.
439,
440,RUSTY: Help me.
441,
442,DOCTOR: Why would I do that? Why would any living creature help you?
443,
444,RUSTY: Daleks will die.
445,
446,DOCTOR: Die all you like. Not my problem.
447,
448,RUSTY: Daleks must be destroyed.
449,
450,DOCTOR: Daleks must be de.
451,What did you just say?
452,
453,RUSTY: All Daleks must die. I will destroy the Daleks. Destroy the
454,Daleks. Destroy
455,the Daleks!
456,
457,
458,[Tardis]
459,
460,(Drinking her coffee.)
461,CLARA: A good Dalek?
462,
463,DOCTOR: There's no such thing.
464,
465,CLARA: That's a bit inflexible. Not like you. I'd almost say
466,prejudiced.
467,
468,DOCTOR: (sigh) Do I pay you? I should give you a raise.
469,
470,(The Tardis lands.)
471,"CLARA: You're not my boss, you're one of my hobbies."
472,
473,DOCTOR: Come on.
474,
475,
476,[Lab 01]
477,
478,JOURNEY: That was quick. 
479,"DOCTOR: This is gun girl. She's got a gun, and she's a girl."
480,This is a sort of boss one. Are you the same one as before?
481,
482,MORGAN: Yes. 
483,"DOCTOR: I think he's probably her uncle, but I may"
484,have made that up to pass the time while they were talking. This is
485,"Clara, not my assistant. She's, er, some other word."
486,
487,CLARA: I'm his carer. 
488,"DOCTOR: Yeah, my carer. She cares so I don't have to."
489,
490,
491,[Rusty's room]
492,
493,RUSTY: Doctor.
494,
495,DOCTOR: Hello again.
496,
497,RUSTY: Will you help me?
498,
499,CLARA: Will you?
500,
501,"DOCTOR: A Dalek so damaged,"
502,it's turned good.
503,Morality as malfunction.
504,How do I resist?
505,
506,RUSTY: Daleks must die.
507,Daleks must die.
508,
509,"CLARA: So, what do we do"
510,"with a moral Dalek, then?"
511,
512,DOCTOR: We get into its head. 
513,CLARA: Mmm.
514,How do you get into a Dalek's head?
515,
516,DOCTOR: That wasn't a metaphor. 
517,[Lab 01]
518,
519,(They go to the moleculon
520,nanoscaler.)
521,JOURNEY: These are nanocontrollers.
522,"Once we're miniaturised, they take"
523,over the molecular compression.
524,"When the mission's over,"
525,hit the button.
526,
527,(Journey puts the bracelet on Clara's wrist.)
528,JOURNEY: Are you sure you understand?
529,CLARA: Why wouldn't I?
530,
531,JOURNEY: Because this is a dangerous mission
532,and you look like a school teacher.
533,
534,CLARA: I am a school teacher.
535,Still didn't catch your name.
536,
537,JOURNEY: Journey Blue. 
538,CLARA: Blue?
539,
540,"JOURNEY: Blue, yes. Problem? "
541,"CLARA: No. Er, I just met a soldier called Pink."
542,
543,JOURNEY: Lucky fella.
544,
545,CLARA: Lucky?
546,
547,JOURNEY: From the way you smile.
548,
549,"CLARA: So, er, who makes you smile or is nobody up to the job?"
550,
551,"JOURNEY: My brother. But he burned to death a couple of hours ago, so"
552,he's really letting me down today. Excuse me.
553,
554,DOCTOR: What are those ones for? I don't need armed baby-sitters.
555,
556,GRETCHEN: We're not baby-sitters.
557,ROSS: We're here to shoot you dead if you turn out to be a Dalek spy.
558,
559,"DOCTOR: Well, that's a relief. I hate baby-sitters."
560,
561,"JOURNEY: Okay, listen up. Now, remember, do not hold your breath when"
562,"the nanoscaler engages. You'll feel like you want to,"
563,but you must keep breathing normally during the miniaturisation
564,process.
565,
566,CLARA: Why? 
567,DOCTOR: Ever microwaved a lasagne without pricking the film on top?
568,
569,CLARA: It explodes.
570,
571,DOCTOR: Don't be lasagne.
572,
573,MORGAN: Nanoscaler engaging in five four three two. Nanoscaler engaging
574,now. 
575,COMPUTER: Nanoscaling in progress.
576,
577,(A crossbeam passes back and forth over chamber id
578,AR-O13-AR-F74 until it shrinks
579,with a bump.)
580,COMPUTER: Nanoscaling complete. 
581,MORGAN: Nanoscaling successful.
582,Everyone okay in there?
583,
584,(The chamber is carefully picked up with a pair of tweezers.)
585,JOURNEY : We made it. 
586,
587,[Nanoscaler]
588,
589,JOURNEY: Nobody popped.
590,
591,CLARA: Whoa. Ha.
592,I can't believe this.
593,
594,"DOCTOR: No, neither can I."
595,
596,(The chamber is injected into Rusty's eye-piece. The Doctor reaches out
597,and the surface wibbles.)
598,
599,[Lab 01]
600,
601,"MORGAN: We'll be following you all the way, Rescue One. Good luck all"
602,of you. 
603,(The
604,Doctor's arm distorts as he slowly reaches into the blue 'eye' on the
605,end of the stalk. Then they all push their way through.)
606,COMPUTER: Integration complete. Dalek levels steady.
607,
608,
609,[Eye stalk]
610,
611,CLARA: That was weird.
612,
613,DOCTOR: You've seen nothing yet.
614,
615,CLARA: What are the lights?
616,

648,right now?
649,
650,DOCTOR: You see all those cables?
651,
652,CLARA: Yeah. 
653,DOCTOR: They're not all cables.
654,

663,"Memory banks, but more than that. This is what keeps the Dalek pure."
664,
665,GRETCHEN: How are Daleks pure?
666,

668,"fire, extinguishes even the tiniest glimmer of kindness or compassion."
669,"Imagine the worst possible thing in the universe, then don't bother,"
670,because you're looking at it right now.

690,
691,(Another harpoon goes in.)
692,"JOURNEY: We need a way down, the only way "
693,"DOCTOR: This is a Dalek, not a machine. It's a perfect analogue of a"
694,"living being, and you just hurt it."
695,So what's going to happen now?
696,
697,"CLARA: Oh, God."
698,
699,GRETCHEN: What?
700,What is it?
701,
702,CLARA: Antibodies?
703,
704,DOCTOR: Dalek antibodies. 
705,(Little round objects fly into view.) 
706,DOCTOR: Nobody move
707,"Any attempt to help him, or attack those things, will identify you as a"
708,secondary source of infection. Stay still!
709,
710,"(The antibodies open to reveal a big blue eye, then surround Ross.)"

712,
713,DOCTOR: Can you control your antibodies?
714,
715,"JOURNEY: Ross, stay calm. We're going to get you out of this. "
716,CLARA: Can you?
717,
718,"DOCTOR: Ross, swallow that."

720,ROSS: What is it? 
721,DOCTOR: Trust me.
722,

733,DOCTOR: The hoovering.
734,
735,(The antibody flies away. The Doctor raises his sonic screwdriver.)
736,DOCTOR: Gotcha. 
737,CLARA: What did you give him?
738,
739,"DOCTOR: Oh, just a spare power cell, but"
740,I can track the radiation signature. I need to know where they dump the
741,bodies.
742,
743,JOURNEY: I thought you were saving him.
744,
745,DOCTOR: He was dead already. I was saving us. Follow me and run. 
746,CLARA: Run!
747,(The other antibodies follow at a distance. The Doctor stops at a hole
748,in the ledge.)
749,DOCTOR: They've dumped him in here. Organic refuse disposal.
750,We need to get in there. 
751,CLARA: Why?
752,
753,(Gretchen and Journey shoot at the antibodies.)
754,DOCTOR: Those antibodies won't give up until we're inside there. I'd
755,rather go in alive than dead.
756,
757,JOURNEY: You don't know where it goes. 
758,"DOCTOR: Yes, I do. Away from here. Now in. In! In!"
759,
760,(Clara jumps down the hole.)
761,GRETCHEN: I can hold them off.
762,

788,you know why that's good?
789,
790,JOURNEY: There is nothing good about that.
791,
792,"DOCTOR: Nothing is alive in here, so logically this is the weakest spot"
793,in the Dalek's internal security.
