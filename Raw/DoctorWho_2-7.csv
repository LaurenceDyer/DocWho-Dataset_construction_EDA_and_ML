18,One - The Space Museum 
19, [Tardis]
20,
21, (This planet has an array of spaceships on it. The
22,"Tardis materialises, and everybody is wearing their ordinary clothes,"
23,not the Crusader ones they had on when they became immobile at the end
24,"of the last episode. The Doctor moves first, then Vicki.) "
25,"DOCTOR: Oh, lights. Oh, that's better. Ah, good! Well now, we seem to"
26,have materialised much quicker than I thought. 
27,"IAN: Doctor, we've got our clothes on. "
28,"DOCTOR: Well, I should hope so, dear boy. I should hope so. "
29,"BARBARA: No, Doctor. Our ordinary, everyday clothes. "
30,"DOCTOR: Well, upon my soul, yes. Yes. Now isn't that extraordinary?"
31,"Yes, we were wearing those cloaks and things, weren't we? Well, I must"
32,"say, it's going to save us a lot of bother changing. Yes. Now, lets see"
33,"where we are, shall we? "
34,IAN: Doctor! You can't dismiss it like that! We were standing here in
35,thirteenth century clothes. We can't suddenly 
36,"DOCTOR: My dear boy, it's over and done with. Now lets forget it. See"
37,"where we are. Come along, pay attention. "
38,"VICKI: But Doctor, where are the clothes we were wearing? "
39,"DOCTOR: I expect, child, they're hanging up where they're supposed to"
40,"be. If you're that much concerned, go and have a look. "
41,VICKI: All right. I will. 
42,"DOCTOR: And on your way back, bring me glass of water please, I'm very"
43,parched. 
44,VICKI: Okay. 
45,(Vicki leaves) 
46,"DOCTOR: Oh, dear, dear, dear. Now where were we? All this fussation"
47,"about a change of clothes. You know, its so simple. It's time and"
48,"relativity, my dear boy. Time and relativity. That's where the answer"
49,lies. 
50,"IAN: I dare say it does, Doctor, but we'd be a lot happier if you would"
51,explain it to us. 
52,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I know. Well, at the moment there isn't time. Now,"
53,"just pay attention, will you? (Looking up at the scanner.) What's this?"
54,
55,VICKI : Doctor! Our crusading clothes are here. 
56,"DOCTOR: Good, good! There you are, you see? Yes, you see?"
57,
58,[Tardis living area]
59,
60," (Vicki gets a glass of water from the dispenser,"
61,but drops it. Then the broken pieces reverse and reform into a complete
62,glass of water again)
63,
64, [Tardis]
65,
66," DOCTOR: Well, the scanners functioning. Looks like"
67,desert to me. 
68,BARBARA: Oh look! Spaceships! 
69,"(On the scanner, the multitude of spacecraft appears.) "
70,"BARBARA: Well, it's so quiet, it could be a graveyard. "
71,"IAN: No, more like a launching pad to me. Maybe it's a dumping ground. "
72,"DOCTOR: No, I don't think so, my boy, no. No, all those things up there"
73,come from a different period. 
74,"BARBARA: Well, there isn't any sign of life. Look! There's a building."
75,"What do you make of that, Doctor? "
76,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm afraid I can't give you any answers here, my dear. "
77,"IAN: You mean you want to go and have a closer look, eh? "
78,"DOCTOR: Yes, I don't see why not. After all, the readings say it's"
79,quite safe. 
80,"BARBARA: Safe? Well the readings don't always tell us everything, you"
81,know. 
82,(Vicki brings the glass of water and the Doctor drinks it) 
83,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you, my dear. Thank you. So you dropped a glass, did"
84,you? 
85,"VICKI: Yes, Doctor. "
86,"DOCTOR: Well, don't look so concerned, child. It's quite easily"
87,replaced. 
88,"VICKI: Doctor, it doesn't have to be. It all came together again and"
89,"jumped up into my hand. Well, if you don't believe me, you can go and"
90,look. There hasn't been time to clear it up yet. 
91,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, yes, we believe you, child. Yes, we believe you. "
92,"VICKI: Honestly, that's exactly what happened. "
93,"BARBARA: You dropped a glass, and it came together again in your hands?"
94,
95,VICKI: With the water in it. 
96,"DOCTOR: Well, look! Look! You see where we've landed? On a museum. "
97,IAN: A museum? 
98,"BARBARA: A space museum, yes! "
99,"DOCTOR: Precisely. If you take a closer look at those objects, you'll"
100,see that some of them are more advanced in design. It's quite a natural
101,progression. 
102,"IAN: Oh, well, someone must be in charge of them. "
103,"DOCTOR: Yes, we shall find that out. And I'm sure you will agree with"
104,"me, there are several things that we would like an answer to. So I"
105,"suggest we go outside and take a look for ourselves, hmm?"
106,
107, [Planet surface]
108,
109, IAN: Dust everywhere. Maybe you were right about
110,the graveyard. 
111,(The Doctor locks the Tardis) 
112,"VICKI: Hey, Doctor. Come here and have a look at this. "
113,"DOCTOR: Well, isn't that extraordinary? I've never seen erosion in such"
114,an advanced stage. The whole planet appears to be completely dead. 
115,IAN: Dead? 
116,"DOCTOR: Non-existent, extinct. "
117,"IAN: Oh? I've always associated extinction with extreme cold. You know,"
118,something like the dark side of the moon. Haven't you? 
119,BARBARA: Yes. 
120,"DOCTOR: Well, I must say, the atmosphere's quite pleasant. "
121,IAN: Yeah. 
122,"BARBARA: Well, maybe it'll get colder as it gets dark. "
123,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think we shall just have to go and search for the"
124,"answers, and as there's always the element of danger in the unknown, I"
125,suggest we keep closer together. Is that clear? 
126,IAN: Yes. 
127,DOCTOR: Vicki? 
128,"VICKI: Oh, er, yes, Doctor. "
129,"DOCTOR: Good, good. Now I'll take the lead and lets try and find those"
130,buildings we saw on the scanner. 
131,IAN: Doctor! 
132,"DOCTOR: Oh, what is it now, dear boy? "
133,"IAN: We're walking on dust. Several inches thick, I'd say. "
134,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, so it appears, hmm. "
135,IAN: Then why aren't we leaving any footprints? 
136,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's curious, isn't it? Yes, very curious."
137,
138, [Museum entrance]
139,
140,(The walls of the museum are made of something very
141,"alien, with triangular bits sticking out to form a texture) "
142,BARBARA: What an extraordinary building. 
143,IAN: Yes. This looks like the only door. 
144,BARBARA: No windows either. 
145,"DOCTOR: Well, we certainly haven't met anyone yet. "
146,VICKI: Maybe there isn't anybody. 
147,DOCTOR: How are we going to get in there? 
148,"IAN: Well, I don't know. There doesn't seem to be any way of opening"
149,the door. 
150,BARBARA: Have you noticed something? I mean something very peculiar. 
151,"IAN: Well, everything's peculiar. "
152,"DOCTOR: My dear Barbara, if you've seen something or somebody, there's"
153,"no sense in talking in riddles, is there? "
154,"BARBARA: No Doctor, not seen. Its the silence. When we stop talking,"
155,there isn't a sound. Listen. It's the sort of silence you can almost
156,hear. 
157,IAN: More and more like a graveyard. 
158,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's quite enough. Now stop it. You'll have us all"
159,imagining things. There must be an explanation of this little 
160,(The doors open showing two people coming towards them) 
161,IAN: There's someone coming! 
162,DOCTOR: Hide quickly! 
163,VICKI: Where? 
164,DOCTOR: Up against the wall. Quick! 
165,(Barbara stops Vicki sneezing as two men in white approach. But as they
166,go past Vicki does sneeze) 
167,VICKI: I'm sorry! It just came out. 
168,"BARBARA: It's all right, Vicki. They didn't hear it. "
169,IAN: They were only a few feet away. 
170,BARBARA: I know. 
171,"DOCTOR: It's extremely doubtful that they were both deaf. However, the"
172,"fact is, they didn't hear. Now, let's see what's in here."
173,
174,[Museum entrance hall]
175,
176,(Some mechanical equipment and a spacesuit on
177,display) 
178,"BARBARA: Well, there aren't any windows. "
179,"DOCTOR: No, I think there's probably something in the atmosphere that,"
180,"er, has a very slow destructive property, er, hence the lack of"
181,windows. 
182,"BARBARA: Yes, but I don't understand where the light comes from? "
183,"DOCTOR: Oh, I think that might just be some florescent substance in the"
184,"walls. Yes, well, I think you two must admit that my assumption as to"
185,"where we were, has been proved correct. "
186,"IAN: Yes, we might almost be in a museum at home. "
187,VICKI: Except that there are no little men following you about telling
188,you not touch things. 
189,"DOCTOR: Well, you just pretend there are, young lady, and keep your"
190,hands to yourself. 
191,"BARBARA: Well, everything seems quite normal. "
192,DOCTOR: Well why not? Why shouldn't it be? It's quite natural. After
193,"all, you have objects of historical interest on Earth, so why not a"
194,museum in space? I always thought I'd find one someday. 
195,"IAN: Those two men we saw must have been guards. Who started all this,"
196,"do you think, Doctor? "
197,"DOCTOR: Well, I suppose the answer's here somewhere. That's what we've"
198,got to find out. Let's go and have a look in that other room.
199,
200, [Museum Exhibit room]
201,
202, DOCTOR: Chesterton! 
203,IAN: It can't be! 
204,(The adults recoil at the sight of a large pepperpot with a bad
205,"disposition, but it is only an exhibit labelled Dalek, Planet Skaro.) "
206,VICKI: So that's what a Dalek looks like. 
207,"DOCTOR: Don't touch, child. "
208,"BARBARA: What do you know about them, Vicki? "
209,VICKI: Only what I've read in history books. That they invaded Earth
210,"about three hundred years ago, was it? "
211,"IAN: We were there, Vicki. That was one of the periods we visited. "
212,"DOCTOR: I don't mind admitting, my boy, that that thing gave me a"
213,start. Coming face to face to it again. 
214,"VICKI: It's not a bit the way I imagined it. Oh, I mean, the books"
215,"describe them all right but well, this one looks quite friendly. "
216,BARBARA: Friendly? 
217,"IAN: You wouldn't say that, young lady, if ever we meet them again."
218,Which to say the least is very unlikely. I hope. 
219,DOCTOR: Back. Get behind the case. Quick. Quick. Quick. Don't touch it.
220,
221,(They crouch down as two young men in black enter the room. They appear
222,to be talking although we don't hear them. They look around then
223,leave.) 
224,IAN: All right. They've gone. 
225,VICKI: They were talking. 
226,DOCTOR: Undoubtedly. 
227,BARBARA: Yet we didn't hear a word they said. 
228,"IAN: No. Perhaps they have some other means of communication. You know,"
229,"on a very high frequency, or. No? Not very good? "
230,"BARBARA: What do you think, Doctor? "
231,"DOCTOR: Well, I don't know. Chesterton might have had the answer in"
232,"what he just said but, er, I doubt it, I doubt it. Come on. Come on."
233,
234,[Another Museum room]
235,
236," IAN: Well, they didn't seem hostile. That's"
237,something to be thankful for. 
238,"BARBARA: Oh, I don't know. Even the Daleks are friendly to some. "
239,"IAN: Vicki, yes. "
240,"BARBARA: Anyway, even if they are friendly, I doubt if we'll get much"
241,"conversation out of them, unless one of you can lip-read. "
242,(Vicki tries to touch an exhibit but her hand passes through it) 
243,VICKI: Doctor! Doctor! 
244,"DOCTOR: Child, don't make so much noise. What's the matter? "
245,VICKI: I touched that thing and 
246,DOCTOR: I thought I told you not to touch. When are you going to learn
247,to obey me? How you 
248,"BARBARA: All right, Doctor. You can save the scolding till later. Look,"
249,can't you see that Vicki's upset? 
250,DOCTOR: Upset? Upset? Whatever for? Why are you upset child? What's the
251,matter? 
252,VICKI: I touched that thing and my hand went right through it. 
253,(Ian tries to touch the apparatus too) 
254,"VICKI: See? There isn't anything there, is there? "
255,DOCTOR: Incredible. 
256,"VICKI: Well, there is something there, isn't there? I mean, we can all"
257,"see it, can't we? "
258,"BARBARA: Yes, of course we can, Vicki. "
259,"DOCTOR: That's strange. Strange indeed. You know, there must be a"
260,"logical explanation for this somewhere? You know, I think it's just a"
261,matter of putting two and two together to make three. You know there is
262,
263,"IAN: Doctor, look. "
264,(three black-clad men have entered) 
265,"VICKI: Oh, quick, let's hide! "
266,"BARBARA: Well, where can we hide? Doctor, what shall we do? "
267,DOCTOR: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Stand exactly where we are. 
268,(the three men walk past them) 
269,IAN: What do you make of that? 
270,DOCTOR: I've never known anything in my life. In all my years of time
271,"travelling, I "
272,VICKI: That one looked straight at me. 
273,DOCTOR: Utterly unbelievable. 
274,VICKI: And he was talking. His lips were moving. 
275,"DOCTOR: Yes, so strange. And yet we have no communication with them. "
276,"BARBARA: Well then, obviously they couldn't see us. I mean, we're"
277,"strangers, our clothes are different. If they had seen us, they would"
278,"have made some sign, however slight. "
279,"IAN: Right, we're invisible. That settles it. "
280,"DOCTOR: Does it, my boy? Does it? Either that or we're not really here."
281,
282,[Museum Exhibit room]
283,
284, (another one) 
285,IAN: It's the biggest museum I've ever been in. We must have walked for
286,miles. 
287,"VICKI: And all the rooms are exactly the same, just cases and cabinets."
288,I'm beginning to think the Doctor's wrong. 
289,IAN: Oh? 
290,"VICKI: Well, how can we find the answer in here? "
291,"DOCTOR: I have no idea, my child, but until I say otherwise, we"
292,"continue the search. Now, let us see what's in here, hmm? "
293,"BARBARA: Oh, same as all the others, I suppose. "
294,(and there's the Tardis) 
295,DOCTOR: Good gracious me! 
296,"IAN: Well, how did that get in here? "
297,"BARBARA: What does it matter? Look, now that we've found the Tardis,"
298,"come on, let's get out of here. "
299,"IAN: Yes, I agree, it's a stroke of luck. Let's leave at once. "
300,"VICKI: I've had enough of this place, Doctor. "
301,"DOCTOR: Oh? You've all decided, have you? "
302,(But the Tardis isn't tangible) 
303,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid it's going to be a little more difficult than"
304,that. The mists are beginning to clear slightly. I'm just beginning to
305,see reason. Where are we? Where are we? 
306,"BARBARA: Well, here, surely? "
307,DOCTOR: Are we? We must have arrived here in the Tardis sometime. Are
308,we here? Look! 
309,(Then they see themselves in exhibit cases) 
310,BARBARA: That's us. That's not models or pictures. That's us. 
311,"DOCTOR: Yes, exhibits in a Space Museum. "
312,"IAN: Can you explain it, Doctor? "
313,"VICKI: Time, like space, although a dimension in itself also has"
314,dimensions of its own. 
315,"DOCTOR: So you know about it, child? We must have a little chat some"
316,time. 
317,"VICKI: Yes, you see, we really are in those cases, but we're also"
318,standing here looking at ourselves from this dimension. 
319,"BARBARA: Well, it's horrible. Those faces, our faces, just staring. "
320,"IAN: Well, at least it explains what's been happening to us. "
321,"DOCTOR: Yes, it does, my boy. And if we're not there, we can't leave"
322,"footprints, and break glasses, or touch things. "
323,IAN: And nobody can see us. I see. 
324,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, they can. Oh yes, they can see us where we really are."
325,There. 
326,"BARBARA: Is there anyway of getting out of this, Doctor? "
327,"DOCTOR: Well, my dear, I suppose we got into it. There must be. You"
328,"know, I don't mind admitting, I've always found it extremely difficult"
329,to solve the fourth dimension. And here we are. Face to face with the
330,"fourth dimension. You know, I think the Tardis jumped a time track and"
331,ended up here in this fourth dimension. It's extraordinary. It's
332,"inexplicable. No, wait a minute, wait a minute. I think you're all"
333,going to be delighted. I'm going to come up with the answer and it's so
334,"simple. Yes, so simple. "
335,BARBARA: How simple? 
336,DOCTOR: All we have to do is to wait here until we arrive. 
337,BARBARA: I beg your pardon? 
338,"DOCTOR: You see, my dear, before they actually put us in those glass"
339,"cases, we must have arrived here sometime in the Tardis. These people"
340,saw us and thought we were worthy people to be put in their Space
341,Museum. Then 
342,BARBARA: I see! I think. 
343,DOCTOR: But nothing has happened to us yet. What we are doing now is
344,"taking a glimpse into the future, or what might be or could be the"
345,"future. All that leads up to it, is still yet to come. "
346,"VICKI: Doctor, look. Why don't we go and find the Tardis, the real one"
347,"I mean, and get into it and get out of here now? "
348,"DOCTOR: And end up one day, my dear, like that? No, we must not. We've"
349,got to stop it happening. 
350,"IAN: Doctor, when will we arrive? "
351,"DOCTOR: I don't know, my boy, I can't be certain. You see, I'm quite"
352,unable to measure the time dimension that the Tardis jumped. But you'll
353,"notice we're all wearing the same clothes. So, it could be in a few"
354,"moments, or a few seconds. "
355,"BARBARA: Well, how will we know when we have? Arrived, I mean. "
356,DOCTOR: The cases will disappear and we shall all become visible. 
357,IAN: And from that moment we'll be in great danger. 
358,DOCTOR: Precisely. So you see we must succeed in stopping them making
359,"exhibits of us. Otherwise, well, there it is. That's how we're all"
360,going to end up. 
361,BARBARA: Doctor? 
362,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
363,BARBARA: Something strange is happening! I can feel it.
364,
365,[Tardis]
366,
367,(The four figures in Arabian clothes change into
368,sixties clothes. A glass breaks and stays broken. Two white-clothed men
369,find the Tardis and see the footprints in the dust.)
370,
371,[Museum Exhibit room]
372,
373,"(The cases and their occupants disappear, and the"
374,group unfreeze) 
375,BARBARA: They've gone. 
376,"DOCTOR: Yes, my dear. And we've arrived."
377,
378, Episode Two - The
379,Dimensions of Time 
380, [Governor's office]
381,
382,(A white-clothed man brings a piece of equipment in
383,and puts it on a table) 
384,TECHNICIAN: Best I could do sir. It should be good for another hundred
385,years or so. 
386,LOBOS: (the governor) What was wrong with it? 
387,"TECHNICIAN: Well, the clasps had broken, rotted. "
388,"LOBOS: Like everything on this planet, including us. Well, I've got two"
389,"more mimmians before I can go home. Yes, I say it often enough, but"
390,"it's still two thousand Xeron days and it sounds more in days. Yeah, I"
391,"know, I volunteered, you were ordered. If the truth were known, I was"
392,"just as bored on Morok. Still it was home, and youth never appreciates"
393,"what it has. Oh, I don't know what I'm going to do now. Still, let's"
394,"get on with it, shall we? I have to sign these reports. I don't know. "
395,(a messenger enters) 
396,LOBOS: I'm the governor of this planet. You're supposed to show some
397,respect and knock. 
398,"MESSENGER: I'm sorry, sir, the matter's urgent. "
399,LOBOS: Nothing's so urgent you can't knock on my door. 
400,MESSENGER: A ship has landed. 
401,LOBOS: From home? There was no advance notification. 
402,MESSENGER: Not from the planet Morok. Alien. 
403,"LOBOS: Alien? Well, this will indeed be a red letter day for the Xeros"
404,calendar. Have the crew been detained? 
405,"MESSENGER: No, sir. They've left the ship. We've found footprints but"
406,no trace of them. We were unable to enter the craft but it appears to
407,be uninhabited at the moment. 
408,(Lobos gets on the intercom) 
409,LOBOS: Commander B Division? We have uninvited visitors. How many? 
410,"MESSENGER: Unknown, but at least three. "
411,LOBOS: Three or more. Organise a search then detain them for
412,questioning. Visitors? We won't be the only ones looking for them. 
413,TECHNICIAN: The rebels? 
414,LOBOS: Rebels? This local rabble? They're children. 
415,"TECHNICIAN: The children, as you call them, are growing up. "
416,"LOBOS: When they pose a danger, we will destroy them. Until then, the"
417,"problem will keep. Nevertheless, they�ll try and contact our visitors"
418,for help. I must remember to notify the commanders to keep watch. As
419,"for the aliens who have just landed, we may even be able to add to the"
420,museum.
421,
422,[Xeron hideout]
423,
424,(The black-clad men gather) 
425,SITA: Tor is late. It's not like him. 
426,DAKO: I know. He did contact the group in the next sector? 
427,"SITA: Yes, but the Moroks are out checking. If they found him missing,"
428,"they could have pulled him in for questioning. Oh no, he's just been"
429,detained. Stop worrying about it. 
430,"DAKO: Stop worrying? Look, we're just waiting to be rounded up. "
431,SITA: I suppose Tor knows what he's doing. 
432,"DAKO: Huh, does he? I'm beginning to wonder. I know the Moroks have ray"
433,"guns and we're unarmed, but our only chance is to strike. The longer we"

435,(enter young Jeremy Bulloch) 
436,"TOR: But we'll only get one opportunity, Dako, and when we attack we've"
437,got to win. 
438,"SITA: Tor, you're late. "
439,"TOR: I know, something's happened. The Moroks have discovered a"
440,spaceship. 
441,SITA: A spaceship landed here? 
442,DAKO: Where from? 
443,TOR: Nobody knows yet. They'd already left it before the ship was
444,found. 
445,SITA: It doesn't make much difference. They'll contact the Moroks
446,anyway. 
447,"TOR: No, I don't think they will. They've had time to do that and they"
448,haven't. Lobos is organising a search. 
449,SITA: A search? 
450,"DAKO: Tor, I don't understand. Look, everybody knows what this planet's"
451,"used for. A museum. Well, if they came here knowing that, and they must"
452,"have done, it can only be to see the Moroks. "
453,TOR: The universe is huge. There must be millions of planets that have
454,never heard of the Moroks. 
455,SITA: They could have landed here by accident. 
456,"TOR: Well, either way, it's our chance. Well, don't you see? They'll"
457,"have weapons, weapons we can use. "
458,SITA: If they agree to help us. 
459,"TOR: They will, Sita, when they hear our story. "
460,DAKO: But the Moroks are searching. You've already said that. They'll
461,find them first. 
462,"TOR: No, I don't think they'll want to be discovered when they find out"
463,about this place. 
464,"SITA: If they hide, they'll hide from us too. "
465,"TOR: I know, but we've got to try. Come on."

477,"DOCTOR: Chesterton, this is no time to be playing cowboys and indians. "
478,"IAN: Doctor, I might have shot a hole right in the middle of you. "
479,"DOCTOR: Is that so? We have a very serious problem on our hands, and"
480,what are you doing with this anyway? Put it back in there. 
481,"IAN: No, Doctor, this might come in very useful. We might be able to"
482,bluff our way out of here with this. 
483,BARBARA: If we want to get out of here. 
484,"VICKI: Oh, we can't stay here, Barbara, can we? "
485,BARBARA: We must do whatever is necessary to keep us out of those
486,cases. 
487,VICKI: I don't see that staying here would stop it. 
488,"BARBARA: We must break the chain of events that led up to it, and going"
489,out of here might be just what we're not supposed to do. 
490,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think Barbara's quite right, my dear. If we walk out of"
491,"here, it could change the future. Perhaps if we wait until we're taken"
492,"out, that might change the future. The point is, what are we going to"
493,do? Which is it to be? 
494,"VICKI: But Doctor, if we find the Tardis and leave here, then we won't"
495,have to worry about being turned into dummies at all. 
496,"IAN: That's a good point, Doctor. "
497,"DOCTOR: It isn't a good point at all, my dear boy. The fact is the"
498,"future, our future, whether we leave here in the Tardis or not. "
499,"IAN: Yes, I see. It's a difficult problem, isn't it? "
500,"DOCTOR: Yes, it is. "
501,"VICKI: There's no answer. But, Doctor, we've got to decide on"
502,something. 
503,"DOCTOR: Decide, my dear? Spinning a coin would be just as appropriate."
504,"Who would want to put us on show or display, I wonder. "
505,BARBARA: The Doctor's curious. That means we stay. 
506,VICKI: You've lost a button. 
507,"IAN: Oh, so I have. "
508,"DOCTOR: Lost a button? Hmm, that's interesting. Yes, that's very"
509,interesting. 
510,"IAN: Doctor, why do you always show the greatest interest in the least"
511,important things? 
512,"DOCTOR: The least important things sometimes, my dear boy, lead to the"
513,"greatest discoveries. Like steam, for instance, coming out of a kettle."
514,"Yes, I was with him at the time. Let's see now, yes, what was that"
515,fellow's name? 
516,BARBARA: James Watt. 
517,"DOCTOR: Yes, you know, losing a button could change the future. It's a"
518,"pity, my dear boy, you didn't discover it was missing in the cases when"
519,we were standing there staring at each other. 
520,"IAN: Doctor, I'd just come face to face with myself. I wasn't counting"
521,the buttons on my jacket. 
522,"DOCTOR: Yes, I quite understand that. Well, I think we should leave the"
523,"Museum, try and find the Tardis, and make sure that it doesn't end up"
524,in here. Are you all agreeable? 
525,VICKI: Yes!

534,IAN: And which way was that? 
535,"DOCTOR: Your memory is like a sieve, dear boy. We turned right and then"
536,left. 
537,"VICKI: No, no, we turned right when we came in. "
538,"IAN: No, we turned left when we came in. "
539,"BARBARA: Well actually, all the doors and corridors are exactly alike. "
540,"DOCTOR: I beg to differ, You see, you must turn right before you turn"
541,left. 
542,"IAN: Doctor, it depends which way you're facing before you start"
543,turning at all. 
544,"DOCTOR: We were facing from there, down here, therefore "
545,"IAN: Doctor, why don't you admit it. You are just as lost as the rest"
546,of us? 
547,"DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose I must confess I am. Anyway, I suggest we take"
548,"Vicki's advice. We can always re-trace our steps. So, we go this way"
549,and turn right. Right. 
550,(And off they go.) 
551,"BARBARA: Well, I don't remember this. "
552,VICKI: I do.

554,"VICKI: Oh no, I'm not. I remember that thing being over there. "
555,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think Vicki's quite correct. Yes, I have a distinct"
556,"impression we've all been here before. Yes, of course. Yes, yes, yes,"
557,"yes, I know where we are now. "

589,"DAKO: Well, that's all very well but how do we know they're friendly?"

898,no reason to suppose that we all ended up in the cases at exactly the

1113,"TOR: Vicki, we have tried. Occasionally we have overpowered a guard and"

1321,what's going on. There's no knowing what they'll do otherwise. If I am
1322,"captured, I'll just have to hope that you're successful and you find me"
1323,in time. I know it sounds silly but whatever I do may be wrong. I've
1324,got to find them. 
1325,TOR: Vicki. 
1326,VICKI: Yes? 
1327,TOR: Wait a moment. Sita? Go with Vicki to the Museum. I'll join you
1328,later. 
1329,"SITA: Yes, but "
1330,"TOR: Don't argue, Sita. (he gives Vicki the gun back) Do what she tells"
1331,you.

1340,"COMMANDER: You, take over the watch. "

1351,
1352," IAN: Well, what's happening? "
1353,LOBOS: His temperature is returning to normal. 
1354,IAN: Good. Can't you speed things up a bit? 
1355,"LOBOS: After a temperature of several hundred degrees below freezing,"
1356,it is a complicated process. You will have to be patient. 
1357,(The machine stops making a noise) 
1358,LOBOS: Body temperature has now been reached. 
1359,(Ian feels the Doctor's forehead) 
1360,LOBOS: Well? 
1361,IAN: Yes. He's getting warmer. 
1362,LOBOS: Good. We shan't have long to wait. 
1363,DOCTOR: Ahh! 
1364,IAN: Get back! 
1365,"DOCTOR: (waking and groaning) Support me, dear boy. Support me over"
1366,there and sit me down. 
1367,"(The Doctor sits, groaning) "
1368,IAN: How are you feeling? 
1369,DOCTOR: I shall be all right in a minute. It's a bad attack of
1370,"rheumatism. Yes, it always happens to me when I'm cold. "
1371,"IAN: You've been cold all right, Doctor, I can tell you that. "
1372,"DOCTOR: Yes, unfortunately, I'm not used to being subjected to such low"
1373,temperatures. 
1374,"LOBOS: (to guard) When I give you the word, you rush him. "
1375,"IAN: No, well, we'd better bring the circulation back. "
1376,LOBOS: That's an order. 
1377,"DOCTOR: It's all right, dear boy. It's not, it's not the circulation"
1378,freeze. 
1379,IAN: Eh? 
1380,"DOCTOR: Yes, don't fuss. Now don't do that. "
1381,LOBOS: Now! 
1382,(But the guard gets one of the guns jabbed into his chest) 
1383,"DOCTOR: My dear Governor, my dear Lobos, I don't think your soldiers"
1384,"have really got their heart in their job, have they? Thank you for"
1385,"getting me out of this little predicament. Although, I would have been"
1386,better pleased had you done it more voluntary. 
1387,"IAN: Yes, his conscience did need reminding. "
1388,"DOCTOR: Yes. I know, I know. "
1389,IAN: What do you mean you know? Surely you were 
1390,"DOCTOR: Dead? Not at all, my boy. Not at all. I was merely, let me say,"
1391,frozen stiff? 
1392,IAN: You mean you knew everything that was happening? 
1393,DOCTOR: Exactly! My brain was working with the speed of a mechanical
1394,computer. I was asking myself questions and the answers were arriving
1395,"with remarkable alacrity. Yes, yes. I must confess, I didn't enjoy the"
1396,"refrigeration, hence this attack of rheumatism. But thanks to you, my"
1397,"dear boy, I am now de-iced and I think I'm quite capable of facing up"
1398,to the climate once more. 
1399,"LOBOS: I wouldn't be too sure of that, Doctor. Of course, I have no"
1400,"proof, but your brain could very easily have been affected. "
1401,"DOCTOR: The best thing for you, Governor Lobos, is to put you in there."
1402,Then you will have all the proof you needed. But you think yourself
1403,"lucky. My conscience won't allow me to do that. It's a pity, isn't it?"
1404,It's a pity!

1406,
1407,(The Commander and the two guards enter the office
1408,and overhear the conversation in the Preparation room) 
1409,"IAN : Well Doctor, I think the next thing to do is find Barbara and"
1410,"Vicki, eh? "
1411,"DOCTOR : I'm not so sure of that, my dear boy. Where did you say"
1412,you'd left them? 
1413,IAN : In the Museum. 
1414,DOCTOR : And the Tardis? 
1415,"IAN : Well, that was outside the Museum building. "
1416,"DOCTOR: Hmm. I see, I see."
1417,
1418,[Preparation room]
1419,
1420, IAN: What's the problem? Surely we've changed the
1421,future by now? 
1422,"DOCTOR: Yes, and I'm not sure of that either, Chesterton. Have we? Have"
1423,"we? Or are we doing what we're allegedly intended to do? Now, what do"
1424,you think? 
1425,"IAN: Well, I got you out of that thing, I "
1426,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's true."
1427,
1428,[Governor's office]
1429,
1430," DOCTOR: That's true, but I'm sure the Governor"
1431,here would be delighted if we were both put back in there.

1436,Doctor and Ian)

1438,(A guard knocks Ian out. The Doctor turns and sees a gun pointed at
1439,him) 
1440,"LOBOS: Yes, Doctor. You are quite correct. And it would appear that I"
1441,shall have my wish.

1457," COMMANDER: I met this soldier on his way here,"
1458,asked him what he was doing. He said reporting to you on your orders. 
1459,"GUARD: I was a prisoner of one of the aliens, sir. He had a gun. "
1460,LOBOS: Which he took from you. 
1461,"GUARD: Yes, sir. "
1462,COMMANDER: I posted a relief guard and then came back here to see what
1463,was happening. 
1464,"LOBOS: You did well, Commander. Have this man placed under close"
1465,arrest. 
1466,(The intercom buzzes) 
1467,LOBOS: Yes? 
1468,"GUARD : Relief guard, exit 4-1-7. The aliens are just about to"
1469,leave the museum.

1472,"LOBOS: Well, it would appear that this little diversion will soon be"
1473,"over, Commander. "
1474,(Flicks his intercom switches) 
1475,"LOBOS: Strange, no reply from the barracks. Well, it seems that a"
1476,faulty connection has given our friend here another chance. Go with the
1477,"Commander. When you've got them, bring the aliens to me. "
1478,COMMANDER: Yes sir.
1479,

1497,"BARBARA: No, I'm fine. "
1498,DAKO: Sita! Where did you come from? And guns! 
1499,"SITA: Yes, the revolution's finally started. We broke into the armoury."
1500,Tor is leading an attack on the Morok barracks. 
1501,"DAKO: Well, why aren't you there? "
1502,SITA: We came for you. 
1503,VICKI: Is Ian still inside? 
1504,"BARBARA: Well, I don't see how he could be. I think he must have been"
1505,captured by the guards. 
1506,"VICKI: Taken to wherever the Doctor is, I suppose. Oh, Barbara, we've"
1507,got to find them. We've got a chance now. 
1508,BARBARA: Why? What's happened? 
1509,"VICKI: Everything's going to be all right, I know it is. When the"
1510,"revolution succeeds, Tor and the Xerons are going to destroy this"
1511,"Museum and all the exhibits. Well, we can't be put in a museum that"
1512,"doesn't exist any more, can we? "
1513,SITA: Dako and myself are going to try and see if we can find Tor. Are
1514,you coming? 
1515,"VICKI: No, I don't think so, are we, Barbara. "
1516,"BARBARA: Well, we must find out where Ian and the Doctor were taken."
1517,"And if that means just wandering around the exhibition aimlessly, well,"
1518,"we may as well go with them, Tor. "
1519,VICKI: Where will they be taken? 
1520,"SITA: The Governor's office, I expect. First of all, anyway. "
1521,"VICKI: We don't want to go there, do we? "
1522,"COMMANDER: Possibly not, but that's where you are going. "
1523,(The Moroks shoot Sita and Dako) 
1524,VICKI: Sita. 
1525,COMMANDER: (taking Vicki's gun) Where did you get this? I asked you a
1526,question. 
1527,"VICKI: I, I can't remember. "
1528,COMMANDER: Soldier. Have their been any guerilla actions against us? 
1529,GUARD: None recently. 
1530,COMMANDER: Have any arms fallen into Xeron hands? 
1531,"GUARD: No, sir, not that I know of. "
1532,COMMANDER: It seems as though our illustrious Governor is going to have
1533,more than his usual batch of questions to ask. Move.

1536,
1537,(Lobos is still flicking intercom switches) 
1538,COMMANDER: No answer. 
1539,"LOBOS: No. First the barracks, now the armoury. Well, the soldier will"
1540,report as soon as he gets there. 
1541,"COMMANDER: Yes, sir. You don't think "
1542,"LOBOS: I don't think anything, Commander. All I know is that this gun"
1543,came from the weapons store.

1552,more than that to get us out of this situation. 
1553,"IAN: Well, exhibits in a forgotten museum, eh? Is that how we're all"
1554,going to end up? Not with this apparatus. 
1555,(Ian rips a piece of the dome contraption and stamps on it) 
1556,"DOCTOR: Well, my boy, you'd hardly call me a pessimist, but I think"
1557,it's most unlikely that that is the only contraption of its kind. 
1558,"BARBARA: Well, you can't blame Ian for letting off steam, Doctor. Oh, I"
1559,wish I'd had thought of it. I'd have smashed the whole thing too. 
1560,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think I would have done the same thing. "
1561,VICKI: But we must have changed the future! We just must have done! 
1562,BARBARA: Must we Vicki? Or were all the things that happened planned
1563,"out for us? Four separate journeys. Four choices, that led all the"
1564,"time, closer to here. Maybe it could have changed things if I hadn't"
1565,left that Museum. 
1566,"DOCTOR: Yes, and perhaps I shouldn't have got myself captured. "
1567,"IAN: Well, if your all joining in, I suppose I. Oh, what's the use. "
1568,"VICKI: It hasn't happened yet, you know. "
1569,"DOCTOR: Yes, Vicki's quite right. Quite right. "
1570,"IAN: It's only a matter of time, isn't it, Doctor? "
1571,"DOCTOR: Well, it's not necessarily, my boy. "
1572,"BARBARA: But Doctor, what can we do now to "
1573,"DOCTOR: My dear Barbara, you must try and remember, the short time"
1574,"we've been on this planet, we've met people, spoken to them and who"
1575,"knows, we might have even influenced them. "
1576,"VICKI: That's what I was trying to say, Doctor. "
1577,"DOCTOR: Yes, I knew you were, child, yes. Yes, I knew you were. "
1578,IAN: You mean we don't necessarily have to change our own future. It
1579,could be changed for us. 
1580,"DOCTOR: Quite so, yes, quite so, my boy. "

1600,DAKO: Yes. 
1601,"TOR: Well, where to, Dako? Where did they take them? "

1613,Argh! 
1614,LOBOS: Hello? Hello? This is Governor Lobos. We'll still get away. I've

1643,IAN: Just that? 
1644,"DOCTOR: You know, it's a funny thing how it happened. It got stuck. I"
1645,don't know whether you've gone into a room and switched on the light
1646,and had to wait for a second or two before the thing lit itself up. 
1647,"BARBARA: Yes, I have. I think most people have. "
1648,"DOCTOR: Well, this is the same kind of problem, you see. We landed on a"
1649,"separate time track, wandered around a bit, and until this little thing"
1650,"clicked itself into place, we hadn't actually arrived. "
1651,"IAN: Ah. Well, thanks very much for explaining it. "
1652,"DOCTOR: Not at all, my dear boy, anytime, anytime. "
1653,"IAN: Yes, well, do you want it back? "

1661,"TOR: Oh, we only want on Xeros what belongs to Xeros, Vicki. The rest"
1662,will be broken up.

1667,"IAN: Doctor, what is that extraordinary thing you've got in the Tardis?"
1668,
1669,"DOCTOR: Ah, that my boy, yes. Well that I got from the Space Museum."
1670,"This young man here, Tor, very kindly gave it to me as a souvenir. "
1671,IAN: A souvenir? Ha! Couldn't you get something a little smaller? 
1672,"DOCTOR: My dear Chesterton, I don't think I have to ask your permission"
1673,"for what I take in my ship, and another thing, I will not have "
1674,"BARBARA: Oh no, Doctor, of course you don't. But, er, what is it? It"
1675,looks terribly interesting. 
1676,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, as a matter of fact, my dear, it's what they call a"
1677,"Time and Space Visualiser. You know, I couldn't believe my eyes when I"
1678,saw it in the Space Museum. And I have an idea I can get it working
1679,again. 
1680,"IAN: Yes, Doctor, but what exactly does it do? "
1681,"DOCTOR: You will see, you will see. All in good time. Now then, have"
1682,you said your goodbyes?
