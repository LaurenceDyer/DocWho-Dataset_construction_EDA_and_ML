23,(We are seeing a Gallifreyan soldier from someone else's viewpoint.)
24,"SOLDIER: Don't try to speak. If you can hear me, nod. When the headcam's attached for the first time, your speech centres get a bit confused. "
25,"You'll be fine in a bit. Do you want to try standing? Oh, that's it. It'll feel better any second. What I'm doing now is fusing the grid to your "
26,"neural receptors. From now on, the headcam is downloading directly into your memory. A tiny part of your brain is now a hard drive. Takes up "
27,"hardly any space. You won't feel a thing. Now, at the beginning, sometimes this has side-effects. (flash of a screaming soldier) I don't know what "
28,"the guys have been telling you, but trust me, they're not premonitions, okay? Just side-effects, hallucinations. Okay, take a look in the mirror. "
29,I'm going to show you how the fittings work.
30,"(Our soldier turns, sees himself and staggers back, falling over.)"
31,"SOLDIER: It's only an hallucination. It's okay, it's not real, it's not a premonition. Are you listening to me?"
32,"(A little later, the soldier puts on his helmet.)"
33,"SOLDIER: Okay, this is the official stuff. In the event of your death, your headcam memories will be stripped from your cerebral cortex and uploaded "
34,"to your family drives. Anything gruesome or unsuitable for children, like actually dying for instance, will be tinted red. There's a language filter, "
35,which will cut any time you say....
36,(Out onto the battlements.)
37,"SOLDIER: Hedigar, this is the new guy. Don't scare him."
38,HEDIGAR: Do you know why you're safe up here?
39,SOLDIER: Don't do the speech.
40,HEDIGAR: You said don't scare him.
41,SOLDIER: The speech is what scares people.
42,"HEDIGAR: Almost nothing in the universe can get through a sky trench. Nothing in history's ever gotten through two. Up there, we've got four hundred "
43,of them.
44,SOLDIER: Welcome to Arcadia.
45,HEDIGAR: Safest place on Gallifrey.
46,(Static - later.)
47,"SOLDIER: Okay, you take that one, I'll take this one."
48,"(Looking into a screen, observing the skies.)"
49,"SOLDIER: He was right. Nothing can get past a sky trench. But if just one Dalek made it through, it could destroy this entire city. That's all it would take. "
50,"One Dalek. One Dalek acting alone and we're finished. So you scan everything, clear? Everything you see, you scan it. See that little speck over there, a bird or something? "
51,"Pretend its a Dalek. Zoom right in on that. All the way in. Use the vision stabilisers, turn up the enhancers to 10+, initialise the image lock."
52,(It is a Dalek.)
53,SOLDIER: That... that's not actually possible. Lock on to it. Lock on. That's not an hallucination. That's real. That's real! Track it. Track it wherever it goes.
54,(Alarm sounds.)
55,SOLDIER: Dalek incoming. Dalek incoming. Maximum alert.
56,(And now an army of them flying in.)
57,SOLDIER: Daleks incoming. Alert! Alert! 
58,"(A Dalek fires at us, the screen turns red, a scream.)"

72,The end of class bell rings. A young man rushes in
73,as the other students leave.) 
74,CLARA: Have you been running? 
75,"TOM: Are you okay? There was a call for you at the office, from your"
76,doctor. 
77,CLARA: Did he leave an address? 
78,(He hands her a piece of paper. She grabs her motorcycle gear and
79,leaves. The Tardis is parked on the side of a lonely country road.
80,Clara sounds her horn and drives straight at it. The doors open to let

85,(The Doctor is reading a book on Advanced Quantum
86,Mechanics.) 
87,DOCTOR: Draught. 
88,(Clara clicks her fingers and the doors close.) 
89,DOCTOR: Fancy a week in ancient Mesopotamia followed by future Mars? 
90,CLARA: Will there be cocktails? 
91,DOCTOR: On the Moon. 
92,CLARA: The Moon'll do. 
93,(They laugh and embrace.) 
94,DOCTOR: How's the new job? Teach anything good? 
95,CLARA: No. Learn anything? 
96,DOCTOR: Not a thing. 
97,(They slap palms. Alert. Tardis interference detected.) 
98,CLARA: What's happening? 
99,"DOCTOR: Whoa, whoa. We're taking off, but the engines aren't going. "
100,(Because the Tardis has been grabbed by a lifting grapple from a
101,helicopter.) 
102,PILOT : Windmill Eleven to Greyhouse leader. Blue Eagle is

108,"OSGOOD: Hello? Kate Stewart's phone. Oh, hold on."
109,Excuse me. Ma'am. Ma'am! 
110,KATE: The ravens are looking a bit sluggish. Tell Malcolm they need new
111,batteries. 
112,"OSGOOD: It's him. Sorry, it's your personal phone, but, well, I"
113,"recognised the ring tone. It's him, isn't it?Â "
114,(She gets a bit breathless as she hand the phone over.)
115,KATE: Inhaler. 
116,(Her assistant uses her inhaler. Notice the very long multicoloured
117,scarf
118,wrapped around her neck.) 
119,"KATE: Doctor, hello. We found the Tardis in a field. I'm having it"
120,brought in. 
121,[Tardis]
122,
123,"(The Doctor is hanging out of the door, using the"
124,external emergency telephone.) 
125,DOCTOR: No kidding. 
126,KATE : Where are you? 
127,(He holds the phone up towards the helicopter as they fly up the
128,Thames.)

130,[Outside the White Tower / Tardis]
131,
132,"KATE: Oh, my god! Oh, Doctor, I'm so sorry. We had"
133,no idea you were still in there. Come on. 
134,PILOT : Roger. New heading two zero seven. Changing course. 
135,(The turn sends the Doctor out of the door. Clara manages to grab hold
136,of his feet.) 
137,"KATE: Doctor, can you hear me? I don't think he can hear me. "
138,"DOCTOR: Next time, would it kill you to knock? "
139,"KATE: I'm having you taken directly to the scene. Doctor, hello, are"
140,you okay? 
141,DOCTOR: Whoa! I'm just going to pop you on hold. 
142,(He changes position to hang onto the base of the Tardis with his
143,hands.) 
144,KATE: Doctor? 
145,CLARA: Doctor! 
146,(They fly to - )

148,(Trafalgar Square]
149,
150,SOLDIER: Atten - shun! 
151,(The Doctor drops down before the Tardis is lowered to the ground and
152,"salutes Kate, Osgood and the squad of UNIT soldiers waiting for him.) "
153,DOCTOR: Why am I saluting? 
154,"KATE: Doctor, as Chief Scientific Officer, may I extend the official"
155,apologies of UNIT 
156,"DOCTOR: Kate Lethbridge Stewart, a word to the wise. As I'm sure your"
157,"father would have told you, I don't like being picked up. "
158,CLARA: That probably sounded better in his head. 
159,KATE: I'm acting on instructions direct from the throne. Sealed orders
160,"from her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the First. "
161,"CLARA: The Queen? The First? Sorry, Elizabeth the First? "
162,KATE: Her credentials are inside. 
163,(The Doctor is about to break the seal on the message when Kate points
164,back to the National Gallery.) 
165,KATE: No. Inside. 
166,DOCTOR: (to Osgood) Nice scarf. 
167,KATE: What's our cover story for this? 
168,"OSGOOD: Er, Derren Brown. "
169,KATE: Again? 
170,"OSGOOD: Oh, we've sent him flowers. "
171,(The Doctor and Kate head up the steps to the gallery.) 
172,"SOLDIER: Atten-shun! Right, I want a secure perimeter around the"
173,gallery.

176,[National Gallery]
177,
178,"CLARA: Did you know her, Elizabeth the First? "
179,DOCTOR: Unified Intelligence Task Force. 
180,CLARA: Sorry? 
181,DOCTOR: This lot. UNIT. They investigate alien stuff. Anything alien. 
182,"CLARA: What, like you? "
183,DOCTOR: I work for them. 
184,CLARA: You have a job? 
185,DOCTOR: Why shouldn't I have a job? I'd be brilliant at having a job. 
186,CLARA: You don't have a job. 
187,DOCTOR: I do. This is my job. I'm doing it now. 
188,CLARA You never have a job. 
189,DOCTOR: I do. I do. 
190,(A painting is unveiled of an alien Citadel on fire and under attack.)
191,"KATE: Elizabeth's credentials, Doctor. "
192,"CLARA: But, but that's not possible. "
193,DOCTOR: No more. 
194,KATE: That's the title. 
195,DOCTOR: I know the title. 
196,KATE: Also known as Gallifrey Falls. 
197,"DOCTOR: This painting doesn't belong here, not in this time or place. "
198,CLARA: Obviously. 
199,"DOCTOR: It's the fall of Arcadia, Gallifrey's second city. "
200,CLARA: But how is it doing that? How is that possible? It's an oil
201,painting in 3D. 
202,(She steps forward and we can see that she is correct.) 
203,"DOCTOR: Time Lord art. Bigger on the inside. A slice of real time,"
204,frozen. 
205,"KATE: Elizabeth told us where to find it, and its significance. "
206,(The Doctor takes Clara's hand.) 
207,CLARA: You okay? 
208,DOCTOR: He was there. 
209,CLARA: Who was? 
210,DOCTOR: Me. The other me. The one I don't talk about. 
211,CLARA: I don't understand. 
212,"DOCTOR: I've had many faces, many lives. I don't admit to all of them."
213,There's one life I've tried very hard to forget. He was the Doctor who
214,"fought in the Time War, and that was the day he did it. The day I did"
215,it. The day he killed them all. The last day of the Time War. The war
216,to end all wars between my people and the Daleks. And in that battle
217,"there was a man with more blood on his hands than any other, a man who"
218,would commit a crime that would silence the universe. And that man was
219,me. 
220,[Arcadia]
221,
222,(We get treated to the battle scene with fleeing
223,"civilians, buildings being destroyed, flying Daleks and soldiers firing"
224,at them. Lots of explosions and deaths.) 
225,DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate. 
226,"SOLDIER: Message for the High Council, Priority Omega. Arcadia has"
227,"fallen. I repeat, Arcadia has fallen. "
228,"(He sees the Type 40 Tardis with the stuck chameleon circuit, and its"
229,occupant comes towards him. This is the John Hurt Doctor
230,No More version.) 
231,"WARRIOR: Soldier, I'm going to need your gun. "
232,(He shoots at a concrete wall.) 
233,DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate. Exterminate! 
234,"GALLIFREYAN: Please. Please, just don't. "
235,DALEK: Alert! Alert! The Doctor is detected. 
236,DALEKS: The Doctor is surrounded! 
237,"DALEK: Inform High Command we have the Doctor. Seek, locate, destroy. "
238,(The Gallifreyan family sneak away. The Doctor has etched No More into
239,the concrete wall.) 
240,"DALEKS: Seek, locate, destroy. Seek "
241,"(A Tardis smashes through, bashing the Daleks to pieces. "
242,DALEK: The Doctor is escaping. What are these words? Explain. Explain.
243,
244,
245,[War room]
246,
247,(Inside the Citadel.)
248,ANDROGAR: The High Council is in emergency session. They have plans of
249,their own. 
250,GENERAL: To hell with the High Council. Their plans have already
251,"failed. Gallifrey's still in the line of fire. So, he was there then? "
252,"ANDROGAR: He left a message, a written warning for the Daleks. He's a"
253,fool. 
254,"GENERAL: No, he's a madman. "
255,"ANDROGAR: As you can see, sir, all Dalek fleets surrounding the planet"
256,"now converging on the capital, but the Sky Trenches are holding. "
257,(Boom! The building shakes.) 
258,GENERAL: Where did he go next? 
259,"ANDROGAR: What does it matter? This is their biggest ever attack, sir."
260,They're throwing everything at us 
261,"TIME LADY: Sir, we have a security breach to the Time Vaults. "
262,"GENERAL: The Omega Arsenal, where all the forbidden weapons are locked"
263,away. 
264,ANDROGAR: They're not forbidden any more. We've used them all against
265,the Daleks. 
266,GENERAL: No. No we haven't.
267,
268,[Omega Arsenal]
269,
270,(A plinth is empty.) 
271,GENERAL: The Moment is gone. 
272,ANDROGAR: I don't understand. What is the Moment? I've never heard of
273,it. 
274,GENERAL: The galaxy eater. The final work of the ancients of Gallifrey.
275,"A weapon so powerful, the operating system became sentient. According"
276,"to legend, it developed a conscience. "
277,ANDROGAR: And we've never used it. 
278,GENERAL: How do you use a weapon of ultimate mass destruction when it
279,can stand in judgment on you? There is only one man who would even try.
280,
281,[Desert planet]
282,
283,"WARRIOR: Time Lords of Gallifrey, Daleks of Skaro,"
284,I serve notice on you all. Too long I have stayed my hand. No more.
285,"Today you leave me no choice. Today, this war will end. No more. No"
286,more. 
287,"(The War Doctor, Other Doctor or Warrior as I prefer shifts the sack he"
288,is carrying on his back and enters a
289,lonely barn.)
290,
291,[Barn]Â 
292,
293,(He puts down the sack and reveals a brass inlaid
294,clockwork box.) 
295,"WARRIOR: How, how do you work? Why is there never a big red button? "
296,"(He hears scuffling noises, and opens the door.) "
297,WARRIOR: Hello? Is somebody there? 
298,MOMENT: It's nothing. 
299,(A blonde woman who looks exactly like Rose Tyler is sitting on the
300,clockwork box.) 
301,MOMENT: It's just a wolf. 
302,WARRIOR: Don't sit on that! 
303,MOMENT: Why not? 
304,"WARRIOR: Because it's not a chair, it's the most dangerous weapon in"
305,the universe. 
306,(He hurries her from the barn and closes the door behind her. And there
307,"she is, sitting on the box.) "
308,MOMENT: Why can't it be both? Why did you park so far away? Didn't you
309,want her to see it? 
310,WARRIOR: Want who to see? 
311,"MOMENT: The Tardis. You walked for miles, and miles and miles and miles"
312,and miles. 
313,WARRIOR: I was thinking 
314,MOMENT: I heard you. 
315,WARRIOR: You heard me? 
316,MOMENT: No more. No more. 
317,WARRIOR: No more. 
318,MOMENT: No more. No more. 
319,WARRIOR: Stop it. 
320,MOMENT: No more. 
321,WARRIOR: Who are you? 
322,(The clockwork in the box makes a noise.) 
323,WARRIOR: It's activating. Get out of here. 
324,(He tries to take hold of the box.) 
325,WARRIOR: Ow! 
326,MOMENT: What's wrong? 
327,WARRIOR: The interface is hot. 
328,"MOMENT: Well, I do my best. "
329,WARRIOR: There's a power source inside. (penny drops) You're the
330,interface? 
331,"MOMENT: They must have told you the Moment had a conscience. Hello! Oh,"
332,"look at you. Stuck between a girl and a box. Story of your life, eh,"
333,Doctor? 
334,WARRIOR: You know me? 
335,"MOMENT: I hear you. All of you, jangling around in that dusty old head"
336,of yours. I chose this face and form
337,especially for you. It's from your past. Or possibly your future. I
338,always get those two mixed up. 
339,WARRIOR: I don't have a future. 
340,"MOMENT: I think I'm called Rose Tyler. No. Yes. No, sorry, no, no, in"
341,"this form, I'm called Bad Wolf. Are you afraid of the big bad wolf,"
342,Doctor? 
343,WARRIOR: Stop calling me Doctor. 
344,MOMENT: That's the name in your head. 
345,WARRIOR: It shouldn't be. I've been fighting this war for a long time.
346,I've lost the right to be the Doctor. 
347,MOMENT: Then you're the one to save us all. 
348,WARRIOR: Yes. 
349,"MOMENT: If I ever develop an ego, you've got the job. "
350,"WARRIOR: If you have been inside my head, then you know what I've seen."
351,"The suffering. Every moment in time and space is burning. It must end,"
352,and I intend to end it the only way I can. 
353,"MOMENT: And you're going to use me to end it by killing them all,"
354,"Daleks and Time Lords alike. I could, but there will be consequences"
355,for you. 
356,WARRIOR: I have no desire to survive this. 
357,"MOMENT: Then that's your punishment. If you do this, if you kill them"
358,"all, then that's the consequence. You live. Gallifrey. You're going to"
359,"burn it, and all those Daleks with it, but all those children too. How"
360,many children on Gallifrey right now? 
361,WARRIOR: I don't know. 
362,MOMENT: One day you will count them. One terrible night. Do you want to
363,"see what that will turn you into? Come on, aren't you curious? "
364,A whirling portal opens above them.) 
365,MOMENT: I'm opening windows on your future. A tangle in time through
366,"the days to come, to the man today will make of you. "
367,(A fez drops through the portal.) 
368,"MOMENT: Okay, I wasn't expecting that."
369,
370,[National Gallery]
371,
372,CLARA: But the Time War's over. Why have you
373,brought us here to look at a painting? 
374,"KATE: The painting only serves as Elizabeth's credentials, proof that"
375,the letter is from her. It's not why you're here. 
376,(The Doctor breaks the wax seal and unfolds the paper.) 
377,"ELIZABETH : My dearest love, I hope the painting known as Gallifrey"
378,Falls will serve as proof that it is your Elizabeth who writes to you
379,now. You will recall that you pledged yourself to the safety of my
380,kingdom. In this capacity I have appointed you as curator of the Under
381,"Gallery, where deadly danger to England is locked away. Should any"
382,"disturbance occur within its walls, it is my wish that you be summoned."
383,"God speed, gently husband. "
384,DOCTOR: What happened? 
385,KATE: Easier to show you. 
386,(The Doctor and Clara leave with Kate. The man with Osgood answers his
387,phone.) 
388,"MCGILLOP: McGillop. But that's not possible. I was just. Understood,"
389,sir. But why would I take it there? 
390,"(Meanwhile, a metal shutter comes down behind the Doctor and Clara as"
391,they stand in front of a painting on wood of Gloriana herself.) 
392,"CLARA: Elizabeth the First. You knew her, then? "
393,"(And next to Gloriana in the painting, in period costume, is David"
394,Tennant.) 
395,DOCTOR: A long time ago.
396,
397,"[England, 1562]"
398,
399,(The Tardis is parked in a meadow in the bend of a
400,"river. The door is opened, and the previous Doctor gallops out on a"
401,"white horse, with a red-headed lady on the pillion.) "
402,"DOCTOR 10: Allons-y! There you go, your Majesty, what did I tell you?"
403,Bigger on the inside. 
404,ELIZABETH: The door isn't. You nearly took my head off. It's normally
405,me who does that. 
406,(Reclining on cushions near a tent flying the royal pennant.) 
407,"ELIZABETH: Tell me, Doctor, why I'm wasting my time on you. I have wars"
408,to plan. 
409,DOCTOR 10: You have a picnic to eat. 
410,ELIZABETH: You could help me. 
411,"DOCTOR 10: Well, I'm helping you eat the picnic. "
412,"ELIZABETH: But you have a stomach for war. This face has seen conflict,"
413,it's as clear as day. 
414,"DOCTOR 10: Oh, I've seen conflict like you wouldn't believe. But it"
415,"wasn't this face. But never mind that, your Majesty. Up on your feet."
416,"Up, up. "
417,ELIZABETH: How dare you? I'm the Queen of England. 
418,"DOCTOR 10: I'm not English. Elizabeth, will you marry me? "
419,"ELIZABETH: Oh, my dear sweet love. Of course I will. "
420,"DOCTOR 10: Ah, gotcha! "
421,ELIZABETH: My love? 
422,"DOCTOR 10: One, the real Elizabeth would never have accepted my"
423,"marriage proposal. Two, the real Elizabeth would notice when I just"
424,casually mentioned having a different face. But then the real Elizabeth
425,isn't a shape-shifting alien from outer space. And 
426,(He holds out a clockwork gizmo.) 
427,DOCTOR 10: Ding. 
428,ELIZABETH: What's that? 
429,DOCTOR 10: It's a machine that goes ding. Made it myself. Lights up in
430,the presence of shape-shifter DNA. Ooo. Also it can microwave frozen
431,dinners from up to twenty feet and download comics from the future. I
432,never know when to stop. 
433,"ELIZABETH: My love, I do not understand. "
434,"DOCTOR 10: I'm not your love, and yes you do. You're a Zygon. "
435,ELIZABETH: A Zygon? 
436,"DOCTOR 10: Oh, stop it. It's over. A Zygon, yes. Big red rubbery thing"
437,covered in suckers. Surprisingly good kisser. Think the real Queen of
438,England would just decide to share her throne with any old handsome
439,"bloke in a tight suit, just cos he's got amazing hair and a nice horse?"
440,Oh. 
441,"(No more white horse. Instead, there's the Zygon.) "
442,DOCTOR 10: It was the horse. I'm going to be King. Run! 
443,ELIZABETH: What's happening? 
444,DOCTOR 10: We're being attacked by a shape-shifting alien from outer
445,"space, formerly disguised as my horse. "
446,(They run into a ruined building.) 
447,ELIZABETH: What does that mean? 
448,DOCTOR 10: It means we're going to need a new horse. 
449,ELIZABETH: Where's it going? 
450,DOCTOR 10: I'll hold it off. You run. Your people need you. 
451,ELIZABETH: And I need you alive for our wedding day. 
452,"(Elizabeth kisses him, then runs.) "
453,"DOCTOR 10: Oh, good work, Doctor. Nice one. The Virgin Queen? So much"
454,for history. 
455,(Elizabeth runs through the trees while the Doctor tries to lure the
456,Zygon. She screams and the Doctor comes running. His gizmo is dinging a
457,lot.) 
458,"DOCTOR 10: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, very clever. "
459,(He talks to a lop-eared rabbit.) 
460,"DOCTOR 10: Whatever you've got planned, forget it. I'm the Doctor. I'm"
461,nine hundred and four years old. I'm from the planet Gallifrey in the
462,"constellation of Kasterborous. I am the Oncoming Storm, the Bringer of"
463,"Darkness, and you are basically just a rabbit, aren't you? Okay, carry"
464,on. Just a general warning. 
465,ELIZABETH : Doctor! 
466,DOCTOR 10: Elizabeth! 
467,(He finds her lying on the ground.) 
468,ELIZABETH: That thing. Explain what it is. What does it want of us? 
469,DOCTOR 10: That's what I'm trying to find out. Probably just your
470,planet. 
471,(A second Elizabeth walks up.) 
472,"ELIZABETH 2: Doctor. Step away from her, Doctor. That's not me. That's"
473,the creature. 
474,"ELIZABETH: How is that possible? She's me. Doctor, she's me! "
475,(The Doctor tries to use his gizmo.) 
476,ELIZABETH 2: I am indeed me. A compliment that cannot be extended to
477,yourself. 
478,ELIZABETH: Extraordinary. The creature has captured my exact likeness.
479,This is exceptional. 
480,ELIZABETH 2: Exceptional? A Queen would call it impertinent. 
481,ELIZABETH: A Queen would feel compelled to admire the skill of the
482,"execution, before arranging one. "
483,DOCTOR 10: It's not working. 
484,ELIZABETH: One might surmise that the creature would learn quickly to
485,protect itself from any simple means of detection. 
486,ELIZABETH 2: Clearly you understand the creature better than I. But
487,"then, you have the advantage. "
488,(A vortex appears in the air.) 
489,"DOCTOR 10: Back, both of you, now! That's a time fissure. A tear in the"
490,fabric of reality. Anything could happen. 
491,(A red fez drops out of it.) 
492,"DOCTOR: 10: For instance, a fez."

496,(The portrait of the 10th Doctor and Elizabeth is
497,concealing a door.) 
498,KATE: This way. 
499,[Under Gallery]
500,
501,KATE: Welcome to the Under Gallery. This is where
502,Elizabeth the First kept all art deemed too dangerous for public
503,consumption. 
504,(The Doctor scoops up a handful of the sand on the floor in between two
505,rows of
506,statues covered with dust sheets.) 
507,DOCTOR: Stone dust. 
508,KATE: Is it important? 
509,DOCTOR: In twelve hundred years I've never stepped in anything that
510,wasn't. 
511,(Osgood makes a noise.) 
512,"DOCTOR: Oi, you. Are you sciency? "
513,"OSGOOD: Oh, er, well, er, yes. "
514,DOCTOR: Got a name? 
515,OSGOOD: Yes. 
516,"DOCTOR: Good. I've always wanted to meet someone called Yes. Now, I"
517,"want this stone dust analysed. And I want a report in triplicate, with"
518,"lots of graphs and diagrams and complicated sums on my desk, tomorrow"
519,"morning, ASAP, pronto,"
520,L O L. See? Job. Do I have a desk? 
521,KATE: No. 
522,DOCTOR: And I want a desk. 
523,KATE: Get a team. Analyse the stone dust. Inhaler! 
524,"(Further into the under gallery, the Doctor spots the red fez in a"
525,display case. He takes it out and puts it on.) 
526,"CLARA: Someday, you could just walk past a fez. "
527,DOCTOR: Never gonna happen. 
528,(And into another room with broken glass on the floor and alien
529,'paintings'
530,along the wall.) 
531,"SCIENTIST: As you instructed, nothing has been touched. "
532,KATE: This is why we called you in. 
533,CLARA: 3D again. 
534,DOCTOR: Interesting. 
535,CLARA: The broken glass? 
536,"DOCTOR: No, where it's broken from. Look at the shatter pattern. The"
537,glass on all these paintings has been broken from the inside. 
538,"KATE: As you can see, all the paintings are landscapes. No figures of"
539,any kind. 
540,DOCTOR: So? 
541,KATE: There used to be. 
542,(She hands him a pad with the original image on it.) 
543,CLARA: Something's got out the paintings. 
544,DOCTOR: Lots of somethings. Dangerous. 
545,KATE: This whole place has been searched. There's nothing here that
546,"shouldn't be, and nothing's got out. "
547,(Enter the time fissure.) 
548,"DOCTOR: Oh no, not now. "
549,"CLARA: Doctor, what is it? "
550,"DOCTOR: No, not now. I'm busy. "
551,KATE: Is it to do with the paintings? 
552,"DOCTOR: No, no. This is different. I remember this. Almost remember."
553,"Oh, of course. This is where I come in. "
554,(He throws the fez into the fissure.) 
555,DOCTOR: Geronimo! 
556,(And leaps into it himself.) 
557,CLARA: Doctor! 
558,KATE: Wait!
559,
560,
561,"[Woods, 1562]"
562,
563,(And lands heavily.) 
564,DOCTOR: Oof! 
565,(Doctor 10 puts on the fez.) 
566,ELIZABETH: Who is this man? 
567,DOCTOR 10: That's just what I was wondering. 
568,"DOCTOR: Oh, that is skinny. That is proper skinny. I've never seen it"
569,from the outside. It's like a special effect. Oi! 
570,(He knocks the fez to the ground.) 
571,DOCTOR: Ha! Matchstick man. 
572,DOCTOR 10: You're not. 
573,(They both get out their sonic screwdrivers. 11's is bigger and
574,better.) 
575,DOCTOR 10: Compensating. 
576,DOCTOR: For what? 
577,DOCTOR 10: Regeneration. It's a lottery. 
578,"DOCTOR: Oh, he's cool. Isn't he cool? I'm the Doctor and I'm all cool."
579,"Oops, I'm wearing sandshoes. "
580,DOCTOR 10: What are you doing here? I'm busy. 
581,"DOCTOR: Oh, busy. I see. Is that what we're calling it, eh? Eh? "
582,(He puts on his fez and turns to the two Elizabeths.) 
583,"DOCTOR: Hello, ladies. "
584,DOCTOR 10: Don't start. 
585,"DOCTOR: Listen, what you get up to in the privacy of your own"
586,regeneration is your business. 
587,DOCTOR 10: One of them is a Zygon. 
588,DOCTOR: Urgh. I'm not judging you. 
589,"(The time fissure reappears. They both put on their glasses, then"
590,notice each other.) 
591,"BOTH: Oh, lovely. "
592,DOCTOR: Your Majesties. Probably a good time to run. 
593,ELIZABETHS: But what about the creature? 
594,"DOCTOR 10: Elizabeth, whichever one of you is the real one, turn and"
595,run in the opposite direction to the other one. 
596,"ELIZABETHS: Of course, my love. "
597,"ELIZABETH: Stay alive, my love. I am not done with you yet. "
598,(She kisses Doctor 10 and leaves.) 
599,DOCTOR 10: Thanks. Lovely. 
600,"ELIZABETH 2: I understand. Live for me, my darling. We shall be"
601,together again. 
602,(Another kiss and run.) 
603,"DOCTOR 10: Well, won't that be nice? "
604,DOCTOR: One of those was a Zygon. 
605,DOCTOR 10: Yeah. 
606,DOCTOR: Big red rubbery thing covered in suckers. 
607,DOCTOR 10: Yeah. 
608,DOCTOR: Venom sacs in the tongue. 
609,"DOCTOR 10: Yeah, I'm getting the point, thank you. "
610,DOCTOR: Nice. 
611,"CLARA : Doctor, is that you? "
612,"DOCTOR: Ah, hello, Clara. Can you hear me?"
613,
614,[Under Gallery / Woods]
615,
616,"CLARA: Yeah, it's me. We can hear you. Where are"
617,you? 
618,DOCTOR: Where are we? 
619,"DOCTOR 10: England, 1562. "
620,CLARA: Who are you talking to? 
621,DOCTORS: Myself. 
622,KATE: Can you come back through? 
623,DOCTOR: Physical passage may not be possible in both directions. Its.
624,Ah! Hang on. Fez incoming! 
625,CLARA: Nothing here. 
626,DOCTOR 10: So where did it go?
627,
628,[Barn]
629,
630,CLARA : Who's he talking to? 
631,KATE : He said himself.
632,
633,[Under Gallery]
634,
635,KATE: Keep him talking. 
636,(She uses her mobile as she leaves.) 
637,"KATE: Malcolm? Malcolm, I need you to send me one of my father's"
638,incident files. Codenamed Cromer. 70s or 80s depending on the dating
639,protocol. 
640,(Something growls as it watches her go.)
641,
642,"[Woods, 1562]"
643,
644,"DOCTOR 10: Okay, you used to be me, you've done all"
645,this before. What happens next? 
646,DOCTOR: I don't remember. 
647,DOCTOR 10: How can you forget this? 
648,"DOCTOR: Hey, hang on. It's not my fault. You're obviously not paying"
649,enough attention. Reverse the polarity! 
650,(They both aim their sonic screwdrivers at the fissure.) 
651,DOCTOR: It's not working. 
652,DOCTOR 10: We're both reversing the polarity. 
653,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know that. "
654,"DOCTOR 10: There's two of us. I'm reversing it, you're reversing it"
655,back again. We're confusing the polarity. 
656,(The Warrior drops through the time fissure.) 
657,WARRIOR: Anyone lose a fez? 
658,"DOCTOR 10: You. How can you be here? More to the point, why are you"
659,here? 
660,WARRIOR: Good afternoon. I'm looking for the Doctor. 
661,"DOCTOR 10: Well, you've certainly come to the right place. "
662,"WARRIOR: Good. Right. Well, who are you boys? Oh, of course. Are you"
663,his companions? 
664,DOCTOR: His companions? 
665,"WARRIOR: They get younger all the time. Well, if you could point me in"
666,the general direction of the Doctor? 
667,(They both demonstrate their sonic screwdrivers.) 
668,WARRIOR: Really? 
669,DOCTOR: Yeah. 
670,DOCTOR 10: Really. 
671,WARRIOR: You're me? Both of you? 
672,DOCTOR 10: Yep. 
673,WARRIOR: Even that one? 
674,DOCTOR: Yes! 
675,WARRIOR: You're my future selves? 
676,BOTH: Yes! 
677,WARRIOR: Am I having a midlife crisis? Why are you pointing your
678,"screwdrivers like that? They're scientific instruments, not water"
679,pistols. Look like you've seen a ghost. 
680,"DOCTOR 10: Still, loving the posh gravelly thing. It's very convincing."
681,
682,"DOCTOR: Brave words, Dick van Dyke. "
683,"(A troop of soldiers run up, lead by a nobleman.) "
684,BENTHAM: Encircle them. Which of you is the Doctor? The Queen of
685,England is bewitched. I would have the Doctor's head. 
686,"WARRIOR: Well, this has all the makings of your lucky day."
687,
688,[Under Gallery]
689,
690,(Kate returns.) 
691,CLARA: I think there's three of them now.
692,
693,"[Woods, 1562]"
694,
695,KATE : There's a precedent for that. 
696,BENTHAM: What is that? 
697,"WARRIOR: Oh, the pointing again. They're screwdrivers! What are you"
698,"going to do, assemble a cabinet at them? "
699,"BENTHAM: That thing, what witchcraft is it? "
700,"DOCTOR: Ah, yes. Now that you mention it, that is witchcraft. Yes, yes,"
701,yes. Witchy witchcraft. Hello? Hello in there. Excuse me. Hello! 
702,[Under Gallery]
703,
704,DOCTOR : Am I talking to the wicked witch of
705,the well? 
706,KATE: He means you. 
707,CLARA: Why am I the witch? 
708,DOCTOR : Clara? 
709,CLARA: Hello?
710,
711,"[Woods, 1562 / Under Gallery]"
712,
713,"DOCTOR: Clara, hi, hello. Hello. Would you mind"
714,telling these prattling mortals to get themselves begone? 
715,CLARA: What he said. 
716,"DOCTOR: Yes, tiny bit more colour. "
717,"CLARA: Right. Prattling mortals, off you pop, or I'll turn you all into"
718,frogs. 
719,"DOCTOR: Ooo, frogs. Nice. You heard her. "
720,"CLARA: Doctor, what's going on? "
721,"[Woods, 1562]"
722,
723,DOCTOR: It's a timey-wimey thing. 
724,WARRIOR: Timey what? Timey-wimey?

726,(Enter an Elizabeth. The soldiers fall to their knee.)

731,ELIZABETH: Indisposed. Long live the Queen. 
732,SOLDIERS: Long live the Queen. 
733,ELIZABETH: Arrest these men. Take them to the Tower. 
734,"DOCTOR 10: That is not the Queen of England, that's an alien duplicate."
735,
736,"DOCTOR: And you can take it from him, cos he's really checked. "
737,"DOCTOR 10: Oh, shut up. "
738,DOCTOR: Venom sacs in the tongue. 
739,"DOCTOR 10: Seriously, stop it. "
740,"DOCTOR: No, hang on. The Tower. "
741,[Under Gallery]
742,
743,"DOCTOR : Did you say the Tower? Ah, yes,"
744,brilliant. Love the Tower.

749,Wi-Fi? 
750,WARRIOR: Are you capable of speaking without flapping your hands about?
751,
752,DOCTOR: Yes. No. I demand to be incarcerated in the Tower immediately
753,with my
754,co-conspirators Sandshoes and Granddad. 
755,WARRIOR: Granddad? 
756,DOCTOR 10: They're not sandshoes.

772,piece of metal
773,bar and starts scratching on a stone pillar.) 
774,DOCTOR: Three of us in one cell? That's going to cause some nasty
775,anomalies if we don't get out soon. 
776,DOCTOR 10: What are you doing? 
777,DOCTOR: Getting us out. 
778,(The Warrior is using his sonic screwdriver on the wooden door.) 
779,"DOCTOR 10: The sonic won't work on that, it's too primitive. "
780,DOCTOR: Shall we ask for a better quality of door so we can escape? 
781,"DOCTOR 10: Okay, so the Queen of England is now a Zygon. But never mind"
782,"that. Why are we all together? Why are we all here? Well, me and"
783,"Chinny, we were surprised, but you came looking for us. You knew it was"
784,going to happen. Who told you? 
785,(Moment Rose is holding a finger to her lips.)

787,"DOCTOR 10: Yeah, you do have a chin."

790,
791,(The stone dust is being analysed.) 
792,"OSGOOD: Marble, granite. A lot of different stone, but none of it from"
793,the fabric of the building. It's like somebody smashed up a lot of old
794,statues. Are there any missing? 
795,"MCGILLOP: Don't think so. Why would anyone do that, anyway? I mean, I"
796,"know we're meant to keep an open mind, but are we supposed to believe"
797,in creatures that can hide in oil paintings and have some sort of a
798,grudge against statues? You all right? 
799,(Osgood uses her inhaler.) 
800,"OSGOOD: We have to go, right now, this minute. "
801,MCGILLOP: What's wrong? 
802,OSGOOD: The things from the paintings. I know why they smashed the
803,statues. 
804,MCGILLOP: Why? 
805,OSGOOD: Because they needed somewhere to hide. 
806,(The nearby statues raise their dust sheets. Zygons! They attack
807,"McGillop first,"
808,and Osgood runs.)

810,
811,(Osgood gets into the National Gallery and shuts
812,"the door, but a Zygon smashes through the painting of Elizabeth and the"
813,tenth Doctor. She gets into the

815,OSGOOD: The Doctor will save me. The Doctor will save me. The Doctor
816,will save me. The Doctor will save me. The Doctor will save me. 
817,(The Zygon transforms.) 
818,OSGOOD-Z: Excuse me. I'm going to need my inhaler. I so hate it when I
819,"get one with a defect. Ooo, you've got some perfectly horrible memories"
820,"in here, haven't you? So jealous of your pretty sister. I don't blame"
821,you. I wish I'd copied her. 
822,OSGOOD: So do I! 
823,"(The Zygon is standing on the end of Osgood's scarf, so she gives it a"

847,
848,"CLARA: Lock and key? Bit basic, isn't it? "
849,KATE: Can't afford electronic security down here. Got to keep the
850,Doctor out. The whole of the Tower is Tardis-proofed. He really
851,wouldn't approve of the collection. 
852,CLARA: But you let me in. 
853,KATE: You have a top level security rating from your last visit. 
854,"CLARA: Sorry, my what? "
855,KATE: Apologies. We have to screen all his known associates. We can't
856,have information about the Doctor and the Tardis falling into the wrong
857,hands. The consequences could be disastrous. 
858,CLARA: What is that? 
859,KATE: Time travel. A vortex manipulator bequeathed to the UNIT archive
860,"by Captain Jack Harkness on the occasion of his death. Well, one of"
861,"them. No one can know we have this, not even our allies. "
862,CLARA: Why not? 
863,KATE: Think about it. Americans with the ability to rewrite history?
864,You've seen their movies. 
865,"CLARA: Okay, so this is how we're going to rescue the Doctor. "
866,KATE: I'm not sure there's enough power for a two-way trip. In any
867,"event, we don't have the activation code. The Doctor knows we have"
868,"this, so he's always kept the code from us. Let's hope he changes his"

874,"CLARA: Er, Kate? Should they be here? Why have they followed us? "
875,"KATE: Oh, they've probably just finished disposing of the humans a bit"
876,early.

878,"KATE: Dear me. I really do get into character, don't I? "
879,"(Kate spits some venom at Clara, then transforms into a Zygon.) "

889,(The Doctor is still scratching his message.) 
890,"WARRIOR: In theory, I can trigger an isolated sonic shift among the"
891,"molecules, and the door should disintegrate. "
892,DOCTOR 10: We'd have to calculate the exact harmonic resonance of the
893,entire structure down to a sub-atomic level. Even the sonic would take
894,years. 
895,"WARRIOR: No, no, the sonic would take centuries. Oh, we might as well"
896,get started. Help to pass the timey-wimey. Do you have to talk like
897,"children? What is it that makes you so ashamed of being a grown up? Oh,"
898,the way you both look at me. What is that? I'm trying to think of a
899,better word than dread. 
900,DOCTOR 10: It must be really recent for you. 
901,WARRIOR: Recent? 
902,DOCTOR: The Time War. The last day. The day you killed them all. 
903,DOCTOR 10: The day we killed them all. 
904,DOCTOR: Same thing. 
905,MOMENT: It's history for them. All decided. They think their future is
906,real. They don't know it's still up to you. 
907,WARRIOR: I don't talk about it. 
908,DOCTOR 10: You're not talking about it. There's no one else here. 
909,"MOMENT: Go on, ask them. Ask them what you need to know. "
910,WARRIOR: Did you ever count? 
911,DOCTOR: Count what? 
912,WARRIOR: How many children there were on Gallifrey that day. 
913,(The Doctor stops his scratching.) 
914,DOCTOR: I have absolutely no idea. 
915,WARRIOR: How old are you now? 
916,"DOCTOR: Ah, I don't know. I lose track. Twelve hundred and something, I"
917,"think, unless I'm lying. I can't remember if I'm lying about my age,"
918,that's how old I am. 
919,"WARRIOR: Four hundred years older than me, and in all that time you've"
920,never even wondered how many there were? You never once counted? 
921,"DOCTOR: Tell me, what would be the point? "
922,DOCTOR 10: Two point four seven billion. 
923,WARRIOR: You did count! 
924,"DOCTOR 10: You forgot? Four hundred years, is that all it takes? "
925,DOCTOR: I moved on. 
926,DOCTOR 10: Where? Where can you be now that you can forget something
927,like that? 
928,DOCTOR: Spoilers. 
929,"DOCTOR 10: No. No, no, no. For once I would like to know where I'm"
930,going. 
931,"DOCTOR: No, you really wouldn't. "
932,"WARRIOR: I don't know who you are, either of you. I haven't got the"
933,faintest idea. 
934,MOMENT: They're you. They're what you become if you destroy Gallifrey.
935,The man who regrets and the man who forgets. The moment is coming. The
936,Moment is me. You have to decide. 
937,WARRIOR: No. 
938,DOCTOR 10: No? 
939,"WARRIOR: Just, no. "
940,(The Doctor laughs.) 
941,DOCTOR 10: Is something funny? Did I miss a funny thing? 
942,DOCTOR: Sorry. It just occured to me. This is what I'm like when I'm
943,alone. 
944,"MOMENT: It's the same screwdriver. Same software, different case. "
945,WARRIOR: Four hundred years. 
946,DOCTOR 10: I'm sorry? 
947,"WARRIOR: At a software level, they're all the same device, aren't they."
948,"Same software, different case. "
949,DOCTOR 10: Yeah. 
950,DOCTOR: So. 
951,"WARRIOR: So, it would take centuries for the screwdriver to calculate"
952,"how to disintegrate the door. Scanning the door, implanting the"
953,"calculation as a permanent subroutine in the software architecture and,"
954,"if you really are me, with your sandshoes and your"
955,"dickie bow, and that screwdriver is still mine, that calculation is"
956,still going on. 
957,"DOCTOR 10: Yeah, still going. "
958,DOCTOR: Calculation complete. 
959,"MOMENT: Same software, different face. "
960,"DOCTOR: Hey, four hundred years in four seconds. We may have had our"
961,"differences, which is frankly odd in the circumstances, but, I tell you"
962,"what, boys. We are incredibly clever. "
963,(Clara opens the door and nearly falls in.) 
964,DOCTOR: How did you do that? 
965,CLARA: It wasn't locked. 
966,DOCTOR: Right. 
967,"CLARA: So they're both you, then, yeah? "
968,DOCTOR: Yes. You've met them before. Don't you remember? 
969,CLARA: A bit. Nice suit. 
970,DOCTOR 10: Thanks. 
971,"CLARA: Hang on. Three of you in one cell, and none of you thought to"
972,try the door? 
973,WARRIOR: It should have been locked. 
974,DOCTOR: Yes. Exactly. Why wasn't it locked? 
975,ELIZABETH: Because I was fascinated to see what you would do upon
976,escaping. I understand you're rather fond of this world. It's time I
977,think you saw what's going to happen to it.

984,of red suckers covering a human.) 
985,"OSGOOD: Kate? Oh goodness, you're not actually dead. Oh, that's"
986,"tremendous news. Those creatures, they turn themselves into copies. And"
987,"they need to keep the original alive, refresh the image so to speak. "
988,"KATE: Where, where did they go? "
989,"OSGOOD: I don't know. Oh, hang on, yes, I do. The Tower. "
990,"KATE: If those creatures have got access to the Black Archive, we may"
991,just have lost control of the planet.

995,(Another part of the Tower dungeons.) 
996,ELIZABETH: The Zygons lost their own world. It burnt in the first days
997,of the Time War. A new home is required. 
998,CLARA: So they want this one. 
999,ELIZABETH: Not yet. It's far too primitive. Zygons are used to a
1000,certain level of comfort. 
1001,"ZYGON: Commander, why are these creatures here? "
1002,ELIZABETH: Because I say they should be. It is time you too were
1003,translated. Observe this. I believe you will find it fascinating. 
1004,"(The Zygon puts his hand on a glass cube with dents in the corners,"
1005,then vanishes. The 3D
1006,landscape painting from the Under Gallery is nearby.) 
1007,CLARA: That's him! That's the Zygon in the picture now. 
1008,"WARRIOR: It's not a picture, it's a stasis cube. Time Lord art. Frozen"
1009,"instants in time, bigger on the inside, but could be deployed as "
1010,"DOCTOR 10: Suspended animation. Oh, that's very good. The Zygons all"
1011,"pop inside the pictures, wait a few centuries till the planet's a bit"
1012,"more interesting, and then out they come. "
1013,"DOCTOR: You see, Clara, they're stored in the paintings in the Under"
1014,"Gallery, like cup-a-soups. Except you add time, if you can picture"
1015,that. Nobody could picture that. Forget I said cup-a-soups. 
1016,CLARA: And now the world is worth conquering. So the Zygons are
1017,invading the future from the past. 
1018,DOCTOR: Exactly. 
1019,DOCTOR 10: And do you know why I know that you're a fake? Because
1020,"you're such a bad copy. It's not just the smell, or the unconvincing"
1021,"hair, or the atrocious teeth, or the eyes just a bit too close"
1022,"together, or the breath that could stun a horse. It's because my"
1023,"Elizabeth, the real Elizabeth, would never be stupid enough to reveal"
1024,"her own plan. Honestly, why would you do that? "
1025,ELIZABETH: Because it's not my plan. And I am the real Elizabeth. 
1026,"DOCTOR 10: Okay. So, backtracking a moment just to lend context to my"
1027,earlier remarks. 
1028,ELIZABETH: My twin is dead in the forest. I am accustomed to taking
1029,precautions. 
1030,(She produces a dagger from the garter beneath her skirts.) 
1031,ELIZABETH: These Zygon creatures never even considered that it was me
1032,who survived rather than their own commander. The arrogance that
1033,typifies their kind. 
1034,CLARA: Zygons? 
1035,ELIZABETH: Men. 
1036,CLARA: And you actually killed one of them? 
1037,"ELIZABETH: I may have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but at the"
1038,"time, so did the Zygon. The future of my kingdom is imperilled. Doctor,"
1039,can I rely on your service? 
1040,"DOCTOR 10: Well, I'm going to need my Tardis. "
1041,ELIZABETH: It has been procured already.

1337,know. 
1338,"DOCTOR: Because if they did, they'd probably send for reinforcements. "
1339,CLARA: What? What don't they know? 
1340,"DOCTOR: This time, there's three of us. "
1341,"WARRIOR: Oh! Oh, yes, that is good. That is brilliant! "
1342,"DOCTOR 10: Oh, oh, oh, I'm getting that too! That is brilliant! "
1343,"DOCTOR: Ha, ha, ha! I've been thinking about it for centuries. "
1344,"WARRIOR: She didn't just show me any old future, she showed me exactly"
1345,the future I needed to see. 
1346,MOMENT: Now you're getting it. 
1347,DOCTOR: Eh? Who did? 
1348,"WARRIOR: Oh, Bad Wolf girl, I could kiss you. "
1349,"MOMENT: Yeah, that's going to happen. "
1350,"DOCTOR 10: Sorry, did you just say Bad Wolf? "
1351,CLARA: So what are we doing? What's the plan? 
1352,"WARRIOR: The Dalek fleets are surrounding Gallifrey, firing on it"
1353,constantly. 
1354,"DOCTOR 10: The Sky Trench is holding, but what if the whole planet just"
1355,disappeared? 
1356,CLARA: Tiny bit of an ask. 
1357,DOCTOR 10: The Daleks would be firing on each other. They'd destroy
1358,themselves in their own crossfire. 
1359,"WARRIOR: Gallifrey would be gone, the Daleks would be destroyed, and it"
1360,would look to the rest of the universe as if they'd annihilated each
1361,other. 
1362,CLARA: But where would Gallifrey be? 
1363,"DOCTOR 10: Frozen. Frozen in an instant of time, safe and hidden away. "
1364,DOCTOR: Exactly. 
1365,WARRIOR: Like a painting.
1366,
1367,[War room]
1368,
1369,ANDROGAR: Another one. 
1370,GENERAL: Are you sure the message is from him? 
1371,"ANDROGAR: Oh, yes. "
1372,GENERAL: Why would he do that? 
1373,(The message reads - Gallifrey Stands.) 
1374,GENERAL: What's the mad fool talking about now? 
1375,(Holo-monitors appear as the Doctors introduce themselves.) 
1376,"DOCTOR : Hello, hello, Gallifrey High Command, this is the"
1377,Doctor speaking. 
1378,DOCTOR 10 : Hello! Also the Doctor. Can you hear me? 
1379,"WARRIOR : Also the Doctor, standing ready. "
1380,"GENERAL: Dear God, three of them. All my worst nightmares at once. "
1381,"DOCTOR 10 : General, we have a plan."
1382,
1383,[Tardis]
1384,
1385,"DOCTOR: We should point at this moment, it is a"
1386,fairly terrible plan
1387,
1388,[War room]
1389,
1390,DOCTOR 10 : And almost certainly won't
1391,work. 
1392,DOCTOR : I was happy with fairly terrible. 
1393,"DOCTOR 10 : Sorry, just thinking out loud."
1394,
1395,[Tardis]
1396,
1397,DOCTOR: We're flying our three Tardises into your
1398,lower atmosphere.
1399,
1400,[Tardis 10]
1401,
1402,DOCTOR 10: We're positioned at equidistant
1403,intervals around the globe. Equidistant. So grown up.
1404,
1405,[Tardis 8.5]
1406,
1407,WARRIOR: We're just about ready to do it. 
1408,GENERAL : Ready to do what?
1409,
1410,[Tardis]
1411,
1412,DOCTOR: We're going to freeze Gallifrey.
1413,
1414,[War room]
1415,
1416,"GENERAL: I'm sorry, what?"
1417,
1418,[Tardis 10]
1419,
1420,"DOCTOR 10: Using our Tardises, we're going to"
1421,freeze Gallifrey in a single moment in time.
1422,
1423,[War room]
1424,
1425,"WARRIOR : You know, like those stasis"
1426,"cubes? A single moment in time, held in a parallel pocket universe."
1427,
1428,[Tardis]
1429,
1430,DOCTOR: Except we're going to do it to a whole
1431,planet. 
1432,[Tardis 10]
1433,
1434,DOCTOR 10: And all the people on it.
1435,
1436,[War room]
1437,
1438,GENERAL: What? Even if that were possible
1439,
1440,[Tardis]
1441,
1442,"GENERAL : Which it isn't, why would you do such"
1443,a thing? 
1444,DOCTOR: Because the alternative is burning.
1445,
1446,[Tardis 10]
1447,
1448,DOCTOR 10: And I've seen that.
1449,
1450,[Tardis]
1451,
1452,DOCTOR: And I never want to see it again.
1453,
1454,[War room]
1455,
1456,"GENERAL: We'd be lost in another universe, frozen"
1457,in a single moment. We'd have nothing. 
1458,[Tardis]
1459,
1460,"DOCTOR: You would have hope. And right now, that is"
1461,exactly what you don't have.
1462,
1463,[War room]
1464,
1465,GENERAL: It's delusional. The calculations alone
1466,would take hundreds of years.
1467,
1468,[Tardises]
1469,
1470,(Each Tardis has a stasis cube on the console.)
1471,"DOCTOR: Oh, hundreds and hundreds. "
1472,"DOCTOR 10: But don't worry, I started a very long time ago. "
1473,DOCTOR 1: Calling the War Council of Gallifrey. This is the Doctor. 
1474,DOCTOR: You might say I've been doing this all my lives. 
1475,[War room]
1476,
1477,DOCTOR 2 : Good luck. 
1478,DOCTOR 3 : Standing by. 
1479,DOCTOR 4 : Ready. 
1480,DOCTOR 8 : Commencing calculations. 
1481,DOCTOR 5 : Soon be there. 
1482,DOCTOR 7 : Across the boundaries that divide one universe
1483,from another. 
1484,DOCTOR 6 : Just got to lock on to his coordinates. 
1485,[Tardis 9]
1486,
1487,DOCTOR 9: And for my next trick.
1488,
1489,[War room]
1490,
1491,GENERAL: I didn't know when I was well off. All
1492,twelve of them! 
1493,"ANDROGAR: No, sir. All thirteen! "
1494,(A new pair of grey eyebrows is seen.) 
1495,ANDROGAR: Sir! The Daleks know that something is happening. They're
1496,increasing their fire power. 
1497,"GENERAL: Do it, Doctor. Just do it."
1498,
1499,[Tardises]
1500,
1501,GENERAL : Just do it. 
1502,"DOCTOR: Okay. Gentlemen, we're ready. Geronimo! "
1503,DOCTOR 10: Allons-y! 
1504,"WARRIOR: Oh, for God's sake. Gallifrey stands! "
1505,"(Tardises rush towards the planet and surround it, then whiteout!)"
1506,
1507,[National Gallery]
1508,
1509,(Having a cup of tea in front of Gallifrey Falls.
1510,Three Tardises are lined up by one wall. The opposite is decorated with
1511,a collection of roundels.) 
1512,WARRIOR: I don't suppose we'll know if we actually succeeded. But at
1513,"worst, we failed doing the right thing, as opposed to succeeding in"
1514,doing the wrong. 
1515,"CLARA: Life and soul, you are. "
1516,DOCTOR 10: What is it actually called? 
1517,"DOCTOR: Well, there's some debate. Either No More or Gallifrey Falls. "
1518,WARRIOR: Not very encouraging. 
1519,DOCTOR 10: How did it get here? 
1520,DOCTOR: No idea. 
1521,"DOCTOR 10: There's always something we don't know, isn't there? "
1522,"WARRIOR: One should certainly hope so. Well, gentlemen, it has been an"
1523,honour and a privilege. 
1524,DOCTOR 10: Likewise. 
1525,DOCTOR: Doctor. 
1526,"WARRIOR: And if I grow to be half the man that you are, Clara Oswald, I"
1527,shall be happy indeed. 
1528,CLARA: That's right. Aim high. 
1529,"WARRIOR: I won't remember this, will I? "
1530,"DOCTOR: The time streams are out of sync. You can't retain it, no. "
1531,WARRIOR: So I won't remember that I tried to save Gallifrey rather than
1532,"burn it. I'll have to live with that. But for now, for this moment, I"
1533,am the Doctor again. Thank you. Which one is mine? Ha! 
1534,(He goes into the shabbiest Tardis. It dematerialises.)
1535,
1536,[Tardis 8.5]
1537,
1538,(The Warrior begins to regenerate.) 
1539,"WARRIOR: Oh yes, of course. I suppose it makes sense. Wearing a bit"
1540,thin. I hope the ears are a bit less conspicuous this time.
1541,
1542,[National Gallery]
1543,
1544,"DOCTOR 10: I won't remember either, so you might as"
1545,well tell me. 
1546,DOCTOR: Tell you what? 
1547,DOCTOR 10: Where it is we're going that you don't want to talk about. 
1548,"DOCTOR: I saw Trenzalore, where we're buried. We die in battle among"
1549,millions. 
1550,DOCTOR 10: That's not how it's supposed to be. 
1551,DOCTOR: That's how the story ends. Nothing we can do about it.
1552,Trenzalore is where you're going. 
1553,"DOCTOR 10: Oh, never say nothing. Anyway, good to know my future is in"
1554,"safe hands. Keep a tight hold on it, Clara. "
1555,CLARA: On it. 
1556,(He kisses her hand.) 
1557,"DOCTOR 10: Trenzalore. We need a new destination, because I don't want"
1558,to go. 
1559,"(He gets into the next, not brightly painted, Tardis and it"
1560,dematerialises.) 
1561,DOCTOR: He always says that. 
1562,CLARA: Need a moment alone with your painting? 
1563,DOCTOR: How did you know? 
1564,CLARA: Those big sad eyes. 
1565,DOCTOR: Ah. 
1566,"CLARA: I always know. Oh, by the way, there was an old man looking for"
1567,you. I think it was the curator. 
1568,(She goes into the Tardis. The Doctor sits and looks at the painting.) 
1569,DOCTOR: I could be a curator. I'd be great at curating. I'd be the
1570,Great Curator. I could retire and do that. I could retire and be the
1571,curator of this place. 
1572,"CURATOR: You know, I really think you might. "
1573,"(Yes, that is the current silver haired version of the fourth Doctor"
1574,"you just heard. There's Tom Baker, leaning on a walking stick.) "
1575,DOCTOR: I never forget a face. 
1576,"CURATOR: I know you don't. And in years to come, you might find"
1577,yourself revisiting a
1578,"few. But just the old favourites, eh? "
1579,(The Doctor winks.) 
1580,"CURATOR: You were curious about this painting, I think. I acquired it"
1581,in remarkable circumstances. What do you make of the title? 
1582,DOCTOR: Which title? There's two. No More or Gallifrey Falls. 
1583,"CURATOR: Oh, you see, that's where everybody's wrong. It's all one"
1584,"title. Gallifrey Falls No More. Now, what would you"
1585,"think that means, eh? "
1586,DOCTOR: That Gallifrey didn't fall. It worked. It's still out there. 
1587,CURATOR: I'm only a humble curator. I'm sure I wouldn't know. 
1588,DOCTOR: Then where is it? 
1589,"CURATOR: Where is it indeed? Lost. Shush. Perhaps. Things do get lost,"
1590,"you know. And now you must excuse me. Oh, you have a lot to do. "
1591,DOCTOR: Do I? 
1592,CURATOR: Mmm. 
1593,DOCTOR: Is that what I'm supposed to do now? Go looking for Gallifrey? 
1594,"CURATOR: Oh, it's entirely up to you. Your choice, eh? I can only tell"
1595,"you what I would do if I were you. Oh, if I were you. Oh, perhaps I was"
1596,"you, of course. Or perhaps you are me. Congratulations. "
1597,DOCTOR: Thank you very much. 
1598,"CURATOR: Or perhaps it doesn't matter either way. Who knows, eh? Who"
1599,knows? 
1600,(The Curator leaves a happy Doctor.) 
1601,[Tardis]
1602,
1603,DOCTOR : Clara sometimes asks me if I dream. Of
1604,"course I dream, I tell her. Everybody dreams. But what do you dream"
1605,"about, she'll ask. The same thing everybody dreams about, I tell her. I"
1606,dream about where I'm going. She always laughs at that. But you're not
1607,"going anywhere, you're just wandering about. "
1608,"(He walks out to join his past selves, backs to us, gazing out at the"
1609,stars.) 
1610,DOCTOR : That's not true. Not any more. I have a new destination.
1611,"My journey is the same as yours, the same as anyones. It's taken me so"
1612,"many years, so many lifetimes, but at last I know where I'm going. "
1613,(A big golden planet hangs in the sky. He stands between the 10th and
1614,8.5 Doctors.) 
1615,"DOCTOR : Where I've always been going. Home, the long way round. "
1616,"(Final shot, a front view of the known Doctors. Left to right - 2, 4,"
