21," (A vortex appears, blowing the rubbish around,"
22,"followed by the Doctor, Jack and Martha.) "
23,"MARTHA: Oh, my head. "
24,DOCTOR: Time travel without a capsule. That's a killer. 
25,[Street]
26,
27,"JACK: Still, at least we made it. Earth, twenty"
28,first century by the looks of it. Talk about lucky. 
29,"DOCTOR: That wasn't luck, that was me."

32,
33,"(A few moments earlier, trying to keep out the"
34,Futurekind whilst using the sonic screwdriver on Jack's vortex
35,manipulator bracelet.) 
36,DOCTOR: Hold still! Don't move! Hold it still! 
37,"JACK: I'm telling you, it's broken. It hasn't worked for years. "
38,"DOCTOR: That's because you didn't have me. Martha, grab hold, now! "
39,"(With everyone holding on to the manipulator, they vanish.)"
40,
41,[Street]
42,
43,"JACK: The moral is, if you're going to get stuck at"
44,"the end of the universe, get stuck with an ex-Time Agent and his vortex"
45,manipulator. 
46,"MARTHA: But this Master bloke, he's got the Tardis. He could be"
47,anywhere in time and space. 
48,"DOCTOR: No, he's here. Trust me. "
49,"MARTHA: Who is he, anyway? And that voice at the end, that wasn't the"
50,Professor. 
51,"JACK: If the Master's a Time Lord, then he must have regenerated. "
52,MARTHA: What does that mean? 
53,"JACK: It means he's changed his face, voice, body, everything. New man."
54,
55,(A beggar is tapping the rhythm of the start of the old Who theme on
56,his tin mug. Di di di
57,dum di di di dum.) 
58,MARTHA: Then how are we going to find him? 
59,"DOCTOR: I'll know him, the moment I see him. Time Lords always do. "
60,"MARTHA: But hold on. If he could be anyone, we missed the election. But"
61,it can't be. 
62,(A series of public television screens on lamp posts are broadcasting
63,the news.) 
64,NEWSREADER [on screen]: Mister Saxon has returned from the Palace and
65,is greeting the crowd inside Saxon Headquarters. 
66,(The new Prime Minister is walking down steps with his wife.) 
67,MARTHA: I said I knew that voice. When he spoke inside the Tardis. I've
68,heard that voice hundreds of times. I've seen him. We all have. That
69,was the voice of Harold Saxon. 
70,DOCTOR: That's him. He's Prime Minister. 
71,"PHOTOGRAPHER [on screen]: Mister Saxon, this way, sir. Come on, kiss"
72,"for the lady, sir. "
73,DOCTOR: The Master is Prime Minister of Great Britain. The Master and
74,his wife? 
75,[Outside Saxon HQ]
76,
77,MASTER: This country has been sick. This country
78,needs healing. This country needs medicine. 
79,[Street]
80,
81,"MASTER [on screen]: In fact, I'd go so far as to"
82,"say that what this country really needs right now, is a Doctor. "
83,[10 Downing Street]
84,
85,(The Master and Lucy Saxon are walking along a
86,corridor whilst aides hand him various reports.) 
87,"WOMAN: Finance report, sir. "
88,"WOMAN 2: Military protocol, sir. "
89,"WOMAN 3: EC directive, sir. "
90,"MAN: Annual budget, sir. "
91,MAN 2: Policy recommendations. 
92,(They arrive outside the Cabinet Room.) 
93,"LUCY: I'm so proud of you, Harry. "
94,(The Master kisses her.) 
95,MASTER: Bless. 
96,"TISH: Sir. If you don't mind me asking. I'm sorry, but it's all a bit"
97,new. What exactly do you want me to do? 
98,"MASTER: Oh yes, what was it? "
99,TISH: Tish. Letitia Jones. 
100,"MASTER: Tish. Well then, Tish, you just stand there and look gorgeous. "
101,[Cabinet Room]
102,
103,(The full Cabinet are assembled.) 
104,"MASTER: A glorious day. Downing Street rebuilt, the Cabinet in session."
105,Let the work of government begin. 
106,(He throws the files he has just been given into the air.) 
107,"MASTER: Oh, go on. Crack a smile. It's funny, isn't it? Albert, funny?"
108,No? Little bit? 
109,"DUMFRIES: Very funny, sir. But if we could get down to business, there"
110,"is the matter of policy, of which we have very little. "
111,"MASTER: No, no, no, no. Before we start all that, I just want to say"
112,"thank you. Thank you, one and all. You ugly, fat faced bunch of wet,"
113,snivelling traitors. 
114,"DUMFRIES: Yes, quite, very funny. But I think "
115,"MASTER: No. No, that wasn't funny. You see, I'm not making myself very"
116,clear. Funny is like this. 
117,"(Big grin, wide eyes.) "
118,MASTER: Not funny is like this. 
119,(Deep scowl and frown.) 
120,"MASTER: And right now, I'm not like (grin) I'm like (frown) because you"
121,"are traitors. Yes, you are! As soon as you saw the vote swinging my"
122,"way, you abandoned your parties and you jumped on the Saxon bandwagon."
123,So this is your reward. 
124,(The Master puts on an oxygen mask.) 
125,"DUMFRIES: Excuse me, Prime Minister. Do you mind my asking, what is"
126,that? 
127,MASTER: (muffled) It's a gas mask. 
128,DUMFRIES: I beg your pardon? 
129,MASTER: It's a gas mask. 
130,"DUMFRIES: Yes, but, er, why are you wearing it? "
131,"MASTER: (muffled) Well, because of the gas. "
132,DUMFRIES: I'm sorry? 
133,MASTER: Because of the gas. 
134,DUMFRIES: What gas? 
135,MASTER: (muffled) This gas. 
136,(The conference telephone sets pop up and squirt gas at the Cabinet and
137,officials.) 
138,DUMFRIES: You're insane! 
139,(The Master gives the thumbs up sign as Dumfries and the rest of his
140,"colleagues die, then starts tapping out that famous rhythm on the"
141,table.)
142,
143,[Martha's home]
144,
145,MARTHA: Home. 
146,"DOCTOR: What have you got? Computer, laptop, anything. Jack, who are"
147,you phoning? You can't tell anyone we're here. 
148,"JACK: Just some friends of mine, but there's no reply. "
149,(Martha fetches her laptop.) 
150,MARTHA: Here you go. Any good? 
151,JACK: I can show you the Saxon websites. He's been around for ages. 
152,MARTHA: That's so weird though. It's the day after the election. That's
153,only four days after I met you. 
154,DOCTOR: We went flying all around the universe while he was here all
155,the time. 
156,MARTHA: You going to tell us who he is? 
157,DOCTOR: He's a Time Lord. 
158,"MARTHA: What about the rest of it? I mean, who'd call himself the"
159,Master? 
160,"DOCTOR: That's all you need to know. Come on, show me Harold Saxon. "
161,(Martha switches on her answering machine.) 
162,"TISH [on machine]: Martha, where are you? I've got this new job. You"
163,won't believe it. It's weird. They just phoned me up out of the blue.
164,I'm working for 
165,(Martha turns it off again.) 
166,"MARTHA: Oh, like it matters. "
167,[Cabinet Office]
168,
169,"(A woman walks through, brandishing a newspaper"
170,article.) 
171,"TISH: I'm sorry, but you're not allowed in "
172,"VIVIEN: Harold Saxon, A Modern Churchill. It's the definitive think"
173,"piece on the man himself. Oh, come on, sweetheart. You must've read it."
174,
175,"TISH: Not really. Sorry, I'm new. "
176,"VIVIEN: Mister Saxon does like a pretty face, but I'm here to see Mrs"
177,Saxon. 
178,TISH: You can't just go barging in. 
179,[Drawing room]
180,
181,"(Meant to be the White Drawing Room, for private"
182,"use of the PM and his family, presumably.) "
183,"VIVIEN: Mrs Saxon. Vivien Rook, Sunday Mirror. You've heard of me. "
184,"LUCY: Oh, can't I just have an hour to myself? It's been a hell of a"
185,day. 
186,"VIVIEN: Oh, strike while the iron's hot, that's what I say, Lucy. I can"
187,"call you Lucy, can't I? Now, everyone's talking about Harold Saxon, but"
188,"I thought, What about the wife? All I need is twenty minutes. "
189,"LUCY: Oh, I think maybe we should wait. "
190,VIVIEN: The headline's waiting to print. The Power Behind the Throne. 
191,LUCY: Really? 
192,VIVIEN: Britain's First Lady. 
193,LUCY: Gosh. 
194,VIVIEN: Front page. 
195,"LUCY: Oh. Well, I suppose. Oh, go on then. Twenty minutes. "
196,"VIVIEN: Excellent! Thank you. Go, go, what was it? Er, Tish. Now you"
197,can leave us alone. 
198,(Vivien gives Tish her coat.) 
199,"TISH: No, but I'm supposed to sit in? "
200,"VIVIEN: No, no, it's only a profile piece. You know, hair and clothes"
201,and nonsense. There's a good girl. Out you go. That's it. 
202,(Tish is pushed out of the room and the door shut in her face.) 
203,"VIVIEN: Mrs Saxon, I have reason to believe that you're in very great"
204,"danger. All of us, in fact. Not just the country, but the whole world."
205,"No, I beg of you, hear me out. "
206,LUCY: What are you talking about? 
207,"VIVIEN: Your husband is not who he says he is. I'm sorry, but it's a"
208,lie. Everything's a lie. 
209,[Martha's home]
210,
211,SHARON OSBOURNE [on laptop]: I'm voting Saxon. He
212,can tick my box any day. 
213,McFLY [on laptop]: Vote Saxon! Go Harry! 
214,ANN WIDDECOMBE [on laptop]: I think Mister Saxon is exactly what this
215,country needs. He's a very fine man. And he's handsome too. 
216,JACK: Former Minister of Defence. First came to prominence when he shot
217,"down the Racnoss on Christmas Eve. Nice work, by the way. "
218,"DOCTOR: Oh, thanks. "
219,MARTHA: But he goes back years. He's famous. Everyone knows his story.
220,"Look. Cambridge University, Rugby blue. Won the Athletics thing. Wrote"
221,"a novel, went into business, marriage, everything. He's got a whole"
222,life. 
223,[Drawing room]
224,
225,"VIVIEN: All of it. The school days, his degree,"
226,"even his mother and father, it's all invented. Look, Harold Saxon never"
227,"went to Cambridge. There was no Harold Saxon. The thing is, it's"
228,obvious. The forgery is screaming out and yet no one can see it. It's
229,as if he's mesmerized the entire world. 
230,LUCY: I think perhaps you should leave now. 
231,"VIVIEN: Eighteen months ago, he became real. This is his first, honest"
232,"to God appearance, just after the downfall of Harriet Jones. And at the"
233,"exact same time, they launched the Archangel Network. "
234,"LUCY: Mrs Rook, now stop it. "
235,VIVIEN: Even now they've said that the Cabinet has gone into seclusion.
236,"I mean, what does that mean, seclusion? "
237,LUCY: How should I know? 
238,"VIVIEN: But I've got plenty of research on you. Yes, good family,"
239,"Roedean, not especially bright but essentially harmless. And that's why"
240,"I'm asking you, Lucy. I am begging you. If you have seen anything,"
241,"heard anything, even the slightest thing that would give you cause to"
242,doubt him? 
243,LUCY: I think 
244,VIVIEN: Yes? 
245,"LUCY: There was a time when we first met, I wondered. But he was so"
246,"good to my father, and he said. "
247,"VIVIEN: What? Just tell me, sweetheart. "
248,"LUCY: The thing is, I made my choice. "
249,VIVIEN: I'm sorry? 
250,"LUCY: For better or for worse. Isn't that right, Harry? "
251,MASTER: My faithful companion. 
252,"VIVIEN: Mister Saxon. Prime Minister, I was just having a little joke"
253,with poor little Lucy. I didn't mean. 
254,"MASTER: Oh, but you're absolutely right. Harold Saxon doesn't exist. "
255,VIVIEN: Then tell me. Who are you? 
256,MASTER: I am the Master and these are my friends. 
257,(Four spheres pop into existence and orbit his head.) 
258,VIVIEN: I'm sorry? 
259,"MASTER: Can't you hear it, Mrs Rook? "
260,VIVIEN: What do you mean? 
261,MASTER: The drumbeat. The drums coming closer and closer. 
262,(Spikes or thin blades now stick out from the spheres.) 
263,FEMALE SPHERE: The lady doesn't like us. 
264,MALE SPHERE: Silly lady. 
265,VIVIEN: No. 
266,MALE SPHERE: Dead lady. 
267,[Outside the Drawing room]
268,
269,(Lucy and the Master run out as the spheres close
270,"in on Vivien and she screams. After a few moments, the Master opens the"
271,door again but the scream is continuing. He shuts it then opens it once
272,more. Still screaming.) 
273,"LUCY: Oh, but she knew. Harry, she knew everything. You promised. You"
274,said Archangel was one hundred percent. 
275,"MASTER: Ninety nine, ninety eight? "
276,"LUCY: But if she's asking questions, then who else? How much time have"
277,we got? 
278,(The Master hugs Lucy.) 
279,MASTER: Tomorrow morning. I promise. That's when everything ends.
280,
281,[Martha's home]
282,
283,(Jack is making them mugs of tea.) 
284,JACK: But he's got the Tardis. Maybe the Master went back in time and
285,has been living here for decades. 
286,DOCTOR: No. 
287,JACK: Why not? Worked for me. 
288,"DOCTOR: When he was stealing the Tardis, the only thing I could do was"
289,fuse the coordinates. I locked them permanently. He can only travel
290,between the year one hundred trillion and the last place the Tardis
291,"landed. Which is right here, right now. "
292,"JACK: Yeah, but a little leeway? "
293,"DOCTOR: Well, eighteen months, tops. The most he could have been here"
294,is eighteen months. So how has he managed all this? The Master was
295,"always sort of hypnotic, but this is on a massive scale. "
296,MARTHA: I was going to vote for him. 
297,DOCTOR: Really? 
298,"MARTHA: Well, it was before I even met you. And I liked him. "
299,JACK: Me too. 
300,DOCTOR: Why do you say that? What was his policy? What did he stand
301,for? 
302,MARTHA: I don't know. He always sounded good. 
303,(She starts tapping the rhythm.) 
304,MARTHA: Like you could trust him. Just nice. He spoke about. I can't
305,"really remember, but it was good. Just the sound of his voice. "
306,DOCTOR: What's that? 
307,MARTHA: What? 
308,"DOCTOR: That. That tapping, that rhythm. What are you doing? "
309,"MARTHA: I don't know. It's nothing. It's just, I don't know. "
310,(A fanfare blares out from the laptop and a pop up says Saxon Broadcast
311,All Channels. The Doctor turns on the TV.) 
312,DOCTOR: Our lord and master is speaking to his kingdom. 
313,"MASTER [on TV]: Britain, Britain, Britain. "
314,[Cabinet room]
315,
316,MASTER: What extraordinary times we've had. Just a
317,"few years ago, this world was so small. And then they came, out of the"
318,"unknown, falling from the skies. You've seen it happen. "
319,[Martha's home]
320,
321,(Over the appropriate film clips.) 
322,MASTER : Big Ben destroyed. A spaceship over London. All those
323,ghosts and metal men. The Christmas star that came to kill. 
324,[Cabinet room]
325,
326,"MASTER: Time and time again, and the government"
327,told you nothing. 
328,(Lucy crosses her fingers.)
329,
330,[Martha's home]
331,
332,"MASTER [on TV]: Well, not me. Not Harold Saxon."
333,Because my purpose 
334,[Cabinet room]
335,
336,(Tish is also present.) 
337,"MASTER: Here today is to tell you this. Citizens of Great Britain, I"
338,have been contacted. 
339,[Martha's home]
340,
341,"MASTER [on TV]: A message for humanity, from beyond"
342,the stars. 
343,"FEMALE SPHERE: People of the Earth, "
344,[Cabinet room]
345,
346,FEMALE SPHERE : We come in peace. We bring
347,great gifts. 
348,[Martha's home]
349,
350,FEMALE SPHERE [on TV]: We bring technology and
351,wisdom and protection. And all we ask in return is your friendship.

353,[Cabinet room]
354,
355,"MASTER: Ooo, sweet. And this species has identified"
356,itself. 
357,[Martha's home]
358,
359,MASTER [on TV]: They are called the Toclafane. 
360,DOCTOR: What? 
361,"MASTER [on TV]: And tomorrow morning, they will appear. Not in secret,"
362,but to all of you. Diplomatic relations with a new species 
363,[Cabinet room]
364,
365,"MASTER: Will begin. Tomorrow, we take our place in"
366,"the universe. Every man, woman and child. Every teacher and chemist and"
367,"lorry driver and farmer. Oh, I don't know, every medical student? "
368,[Martha's home]
369,
370,"(The Doctor turns to look at Martha, then turns the"
371,big old cathode ray tube TV around to see sticks of explosive strapped
372,to the back.) 
373,DOCTOR: Out!

376,[Outside Martha's home]
377,
378,(The first floor of the converted house explodes
379,with a massive fireball smashing the windows.) 
380,DOCTOR: All right? 
381,"JACK: Fine, yeah, fine. "
382,DOCTOR: Martha? What are you doing? 
383,(Martha is dialing on her mobile phone.) 
384,MARTHA: He knows about me. What about my family? 
385,DOCTOR: Don't tell them anything. 
386,MARTHA: I'll do what I like. Mum? Oh my God 
387,[Francine's home]

403,"FRANCINE : Martha, I think perhaps you should"
404,come round.

408,"FRANCINE: No, but it's your father. We've been"
409,talking and 
410,[Outside Martha's home]

412,FRANCINE : We thought we might give it another
413,go. 
414,[Francine's home]

417,FRANCINE: Just come around.

872,MARTHA: I've got Archangel. Everyone's got it.

907,DOCTOR: And back again. See? It just shifts your perception a tiny
908,"little bit. Doesn't make us invisible, just unnoticed. Oh, I know what"
909,"it's like. It's like, it's like when you fancy someone and they don't"

936,think it's down the back of the settee. I did have a quick look. I

1037,[Flight deck]
1038,
1039,"WINTERS: Two minutes, everyone. "
1040,(Winters heads up the steps.) 
1041,"WINTERS: According to the treaty, all armed personnel are requested to"
1042,leave the flight deck immediately. Thank you. 
1043,"TANNOY: Five, four, three, two, one. "
1044,MASTER: Jelly baby? 
1045,WINTERS: Broadcasting at seven fifty eight with the arrival timed for
1046,"eight hundred hours exactly. And, er, good luck to all of us. "
1047,[Tardis]
1048,
1049,(The Doctor taps a gauge on the metal mesh around
1050,the time console.) 
1051,"DOCTOR: As soon as this hits red, it activates. At this speed, it'll"
1052,trigger at two minutes past eight. 
1053,"JACK: First contact is at eight, then two minutes later "
1054,MARTHA: What's it for? What does a paradox machine do? 
1055,"JACK: More important, can you stop it? "
1056,"DOCTOR: Not till I know what it's doing. Touch the wrong bit, blow up"
1057,the solar system. 
1058,MARTHA: Then we've got to get to the Master. 
1059,JACK: Yeah. How are we going to stop him? 
1060,"DOCTOR: Oh, I've got a way. Sorry, didn't I mention it? "
1061,[Various locations]
1062,
1063,(The television is on whilst school children have
1064,"breakfast in the canteen, workers are in a cafe, mothers are feeding"
1065,"their children, etc etc.) "
1066,"NEWS 24: And in just thirty seconds' time, we'll be going live to First"
1067,Contact. It's been announced that Harold Saxon has invited President
1068,Winters to take the address. 
1069,AMNN: It's three am in the morning on the eastern seaboard and
1070,President Winters has been chosen to lead the world into a new age. 
1071,[Flight deck]
1072,
1073,"WINTERS: My fellow Americans, patriots, people of"
1074,"the world. I stand before you today as ambassador for humanity, a role"
1075,I will undertake with the utmost solemnity. Perhaps our Toclafane
1076,"cousins can offer us much, but what is important is not that we gain"
1077,"material benefits, but that we learn to see ourselves anew. "
1078,"(The Doctor, Martha and Jack enter quietly.) "
1079,"WINTERS: For as long as man has looked at the stars, he has wondered"
1080,what mysteries they hold. Now we know we are not alone. 
1081,"JACK: (sotto) This plan, you going to tell us? "
1082,WINTERS: No longer unique in the universe. 
1083,"DOCTOR: If I can get this around the Master's neck, cancel out his"
1084,"perception, they'll see him for real. It's just hard to go unnoticed"
1085,with everyone on red alert. If they stop me you've got a key. 
1086,"JACK: Yes, sir. "
1087,MARTHA: I'll get him. 
1088,"WINTERS: And I ask you now, I ask of the human race, to join with me in"
1089,welcoming our friends. I give you the Toclafane. 
1090,(The four spheres appear.) 
1091,"WINTERS: My name is Arthur Coleman Winters, President Elect of the"
1092,"United States of America, and designated representative of the United"
1093,Nations. I welcome you to the planet Earth and its associated moon. 
1094,MALE SPHERE: You're not the Master. 
1095,FEMALE SPHERE: We like the Mister Master. 
1096,MALE SPHERE 2: We don't like you. 
1097,"WINTERS: I can be master, if you so wish. I will accept mastery over"
1098,"you, if that is God's will. "
1099,MALE SPHERE 2: Man is stupid. 
1100,MALE SPHERE: Master is our friend. 
1101,"FEMALE SPHERE Where's my Master, pretty please? "
1102,"MASTER: Oh, all right then. It's me. Ta da! Sorry, sorry, I have this"
1103,effect. People just get obsessed. Is it the smile? Is it the
1104,aftershave? Is it the capacity to laugh at myself? I don't know. It's
1105,crazy. 
1106,"WINTERS: Saxon, what are you talking about? "
1107,"MASTER: I'm taking control, Uncle Sam, starting with you. Kill him. "
1108,(A sphere points its weapon at Winters and blasts him into little
1109,pieces. General consternation and guns drawn. The Master laughs and
1110,applauds.) 
1111,MASTER: Guards. 
1112,GUARD: Nobody move! Nobody move! 
1113,"MASTER: Now then, peoples of the Earth. Please attend carefully. "
1114,(The Doctor takes off his key and tries to run forward. Two men in
1115,black grab him.) 
1116,GUARD: Stop him! 
1117,"MASTER: We meet at last, Doctor. Oh, ho. I love saying that. "
1118,DOCTOR: Stop it! Stop it now! 
1119,"MASTER: As if a perception filter's going to work on me. And look, it's"
1120,"the girlie and the freak. Although, I'm not sure which one's which. "
1121,(Jack runs forward. The Master zaps him with his screwdriver.) 
1122,"MASTER: Laser screwdriver. Who'd have sonic? And the good thing is,"
1123,he's not dead for long. I get to kill him again! 
1124,"DOCTOR: Master, just calm down. Just look at what you're doing. Just"
1125,stop. If you could see yourself 
1126,"MASTER: Oh, do excuse me. Little bit of personal business. Back in a"
1127,minute. Let him go. 
1128,DOCTOR: It's that sound. The sound in your head. What if I could help? 
1129,"MASTER: Oh, how to shut him up? I know. Memory Lane. Professor Lazarus."
1130,"Remember him and his genetic manipulation device? What, did you think"
1131,that little Tish got that job merely by coincidence? I've been laying
1132,traps for you all this time. And if I can concentrate all that Lazarus
1133,"technology into one little screwdriver? But, ooo, if I only had the"
1134,"Doctor's biological code. Oh, wait a minute, I do. "
1135,(He opens a large metal briefcase.) 
1136,"MASTER: I've got his hand. And if Lazarus made himself younger, what if"
1137,I reverse it? Another hundred years? 
1138,"(The Master aims his screwdriver at the Doctor, who goes into rapid"
1139,convulsions. Jack revives with Martha next to him.) 
1140,JACK: Teleport. 
1141,MARTHA: I can't. 
1142,JACK: We can't stop him. Get out of here. Get out. 
1143,(Lucy is looking very unhappy with all this. The Master stops zapping
1144,"the Doctor, who now looks at least a hundred years old.) "
1145,MARTHA: Doctor? I've got you. 
1146,"MASTER: Ah, she's a would be doctor. But tonight, Martha Jones, we've"
1147,flown them in all the way from prison. 
1148,"(Clive, Tish and Francine are brought in, their wrists fastened"
1149,together with cable ties.) 
1150,"GUARD: Come on, move. "
1151,MARTHA: Mum. 
1152,FRANCINE: I'm sorry. 
1153,DOCTOR: The Toclafane. What are they? Who are they? 
1154,"MASTER: Doctor, if I told you the truth, your hearts would break. "
1155,MALE SPHERE: Is it time? Is it ready? 
1156,FEMALE SPHERE: Is the machine singing? 
1157,"MASTER: Two minutes past. So, Earthings. Basically, er, end of the"
1158,world. Here come the drums! 
1159,(Rogue Trader's song 'Voodoo Child' starts playing as the paradox
1160,machine in the Tardis activates.) 
1161,"SINGER: Here come the drums. Here come the drums. Baby, baby, baby. You"
1162,"are my voodoo child, my voodoo child. Don't say maybe, maybe. "
1163,(A tear appears in the sky above the Valiant and thousands of spheres
1164,pour out.) 
1165,"SINGER: It's supernatural. I'm coming undone. Baby, baby, baby. You are"
1166,"my voodoo child, my voodoo child. Don't say maybe, maybe. It's"
1167,"supernatural. I'm coming undone. Baby, baby, baby. You are my voodoo"
1168,"child, my voodoo child. "
1169,MASTER: How many do you think? 
1170,"LUCY: I, I don't know. "
1171,"MASTER: Six billion. Down you go, kids! "
1172,(The spheres head to the population centres and open fire.) 
1173,"MASTER: Shall we decimate them? That sounds good. A nice word,"
1174,decimate. Remove one tenth of the population! 
1175,"(The Doctor whispers to Martha, although we don't actually see that in"
1176,"this episode. She moves away from him, holding Jack's bracelet.) "
1177,"GENEVA : Valiant, this is Geneva. We're getting slaughtered down"
1178,"here. Valiant, report. Help us. For God's sake, help us! They're"
1179,everywhere! 
1180,(Other reports come in in other languages.) 
1181,"LONDON : This is London, Valiant. This is London calling. What do"
1182,we do? They're killing us! The Toclafane are all around. They're
1183,killing us.

1192,
1193,(The Master and Lucy hold up the ancient Doctor so
1194,he can watch the slaughter.) 
1195,"MASTER: And so it came to pass that the human race fell, and the Earth"
1196,"was no more. And I looked down upon my new dominion as Master of all,"
1197,and I thought it good.
