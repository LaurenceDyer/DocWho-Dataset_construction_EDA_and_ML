38,"DOCTOR 10: Any second now, you're going to stop that countdown. Both of"
39,you. Together.
40,DOCTOR 11: And then you're going to negotiate the most perfect treaty
41,of all time. 
42,"DOCTOR 10: Safeguards all round, completely fair on both sides. "
43,DOCTOR 11: And the key to perfect negotiation? 
44,DOCTOR 10: Not knowing what side you're on.
45,"(The Doctors push back their chairs, stand up, and get out their sonic screwdrivers.)"
46,"DOCTOR 11: So, for the next few hours, until we decide to let you out "

58,(We are watching a recording in progress. The Osgoods are sitting behind
59, a desk with a eighteen inch square box on
60,"it, making a video. The one on the right has a 4th Doctor scarf looped"
61,around her neck. We'll call her Osgood 1. The one on the left is
62,wearing the 7th Doctors query motif pullover. Designate her Osgood 2. 
63,One of the papers pinned to a notice board on the wall is a headline - 
64,"White House Appoints Alien Ambassador.) OSGOOD 2: Hello.OSGOOD 1: Hello. Do you want to?OSGOOD 2: No, you can, if you "
65,BOTH: Shall we do it together? Operation Double. The Zygon peace treaty. 
66,"OSGOOD 2: I'm Osgood. OSGOOD 1: I'm also Osgood.OSGOOD 2: Remember that. It'll be important later.OSGOOD 1: Operation Double is a covert operation, outside of normal UNIT"
67,"strictures, to resettle and rehouse"
68,an alien race in secrecy on planet Earth.
69,"OSGOOD 2:  With UNIT's help, twenty million"
70,Zygons have been allowed
71,"to take human form, been dispersed around the world, and are now living"
72,amongst us.
73,
74,OSGOOD 1: We're making this in case something goes wrong. In case UNIT is
75,infiltrated.
76,In case something occurs to unmask the Zygons. 
77,OSGOOD 2: Or in case one or both
78,of us dies.
79,
80,"(We are shown a cemetery, with an Osgood standing in front a black "
81,"marble headstone simply engraved My Sister, holding white flowers.)"
82,OSGOOD 1: The Zygons are a peaceful race. 
83,OSGOOD 2: Their shape-changing ability should not
84,be considered a weapon.
85,
86,OSGOOD 1: It's a survival mechanism. 
87,"OSGOOD 2: They embed themselves in other cultures, and"
88,live out their lives in their
89,new bodies in peace and harmony. Mainly. 
90,OSGOOD 1: Any race is capable of the best
91,and the worst.
92,
93,OSGOOD 2: Every race is peaceful and warlike. 
94,OSGOOD 1: Good and evil. 
95,OSGOOD 2: My race is no exception.
96,OSGOOD 1: And neither is mine. OSGOOD 2: If one Zygon goes rogue 
97,OSGOOD 1: Or one human 
98,OSGOOD 2: Then the ceasefire will break.
99,(They put their hands on the box.)OSGOOD 2: That's why the Doctor left us this. 
100,"OSGOOD 1: He called it the Osgood Box.OSGOOD 2: If you've been paying attention, you'll be able to guess why. "
101,OSGOOD 1: This is
102,the last resort. 
103,OSGOOD 2: The final sanction.
104,OSGOOD 1: Pray this box is never needed. 
105,"OSGOOD 2: Because if it is, that means the ceasefire is breaking"
106,OSGOOD 1: And with twenty million shape-changing Zygons dispersed around the world
107,
108,OSGOOD 2: That is the Nightmare Scenario.

114,"through the now open door and breaks a glass. She tries another door, "
115,"but it is locked, so she hides under a desk and uses her inhaler before "
116,"getting out her mobile phone. Before she can dial, something with red "
117,rubbery skin walks in. Her finger hovers email icon on her The Doctor T A
118," R D I S Direct Link contact page, then she presses send. The Zygon "
119,"grabs her and pulls her out from under the desk, then incapacitates her "

167,(The Doctor is on the monkey bars with the serious two little girls..)
168,"DOCTOR: Look, I admire you, okay? I think you're ingenious. Pretending"
169,to be a couple of seven year  olds is a splendid way
170,to conceal your blobbiness. But let's not pretend. You're very blobby.
171,"In fact, you two are the big blobs."
172,And you are not patrolling the ceasefire. 
173,"(The girls climb down, the Doctor goes down the slide.)"
174,"DOCTOR: Fine. Fine, bury your heads."
175,Listen to me. Listen!
176,There are other factions. I know that there are other blobby factions

271,"(Clara takes his torch. He splashes liquid from the pool in the centre of the polyp onto its fronds, then caresses some horns.)DOCTOR: If this has been compromised, the Zygons are wide open. They'll be"
272,"starting to panic. Starting to worry.CLARA: Doctor, do you want to be alone with that thing?"
273,DOCTOR: It's a command computer. You operate it by titivating the
274,fronds.
275,"CLARA: Are you enjoying that?DOCTOR: I snogged a Zygon once. Old habits.(Screens come to life, booting up with Sapphire.)"
276,"DOCTOR: Still got the old magic.CLARA: So, Osgood's been kidnapped, right? I thought Osgood was dead.KATE: There've always been two of her, ever since the ceasefire. We never"
277,knew which one was real. 
278,"DOCTOR: Both of them.KATE: Okay, which one was Zygon."
279,DOCTOR: Both of them. They would have maintained a live link. They
280,were both Zygon and human at the same time.
281,"They not only administered the peace, they were the peace. "
282,"JAC: When the other Osgood died, the survivor went pretty much mad with"
283,"grief. Then she just disappeared. Went undercover in the States. Now,"
284,"of course, the rebels have her.DOCTOR: Ah ha! Okay. Zygons hatched and dispersed all over, but something's gone"
285,"wrong. Mexico border, North Asia,"
286,"West Africa, Australia. Panic. Paranoia. What would happen if they knew"
287,who we were?(Beep.)JAC: We've received another video.
288,(They gather round Jac's tablet.)

293,"(Message ends.)DOCTOR: So, we have a Zygon revolution on our hands. We need to open negotiations.KATE: I'm not negotiating with them. As far as they're concerned, everyone's a traitor. "
294,CLARA: If you're not going
295,"to negotiate, what are you going to do?KATE: They're holed up in this settlement in Turmezistan. It's where they've"
296,"taken Osgood. I'm going to order Colonel Walsh to bomb it.DOCTOR: Isn't there a solution that doesn't involve bombing everyone?KATE: The treaty's been comprehensively violated, Doctor.DOCTOR: This is a splinter group. The rest of the Zygons, the vast majority,"
297,they want to live in peace.
298,"You start bombing them, you'll radicalise the lot. That's exactly what"
299,the splinter group wants.JAC: Truth or consequences. What exactly does that mean?KATE: It's just the usual kind of nonsense these idiots call
300,themselves.CLARA: It's in New Mexico. 
301,"KATE: What?CLARA: It's a town in New Mexico. Truth or Consequences. Er, they renamed it"
302,"after a TV show, for a bet or something. It's a Trivial Pursuit"
303,"question. I used to memorise Trivial Pursuit questions so I could win.KATE: That's the last place we received signal from Osgood's phone, isn't it?"
304,New Mexico.
305,"DOCTOR: Okay. Kate Stewart, no bombs for you. Go to Truth Or"
306,Consequences. See what you can find out.
307,"The Doctor will go to Turmezistan. Negotiate peace, rescue Osgood, and"
308,"prevent this war, cos that's what he does."

310,scary monsters. And also from the Zygons.

317,(Night. The Doctor poses on the steps then goes inside his aeroplane. Kate and Clara walk away.)
318,CLARA: How many troops do you have?KATE: Not many. Usually on bigger cases we can draft in from the regular
319,army. We can't do that now. The secrecy of the project has to be
320,"maintained.CLARA: You got any snazzy weapons?KATE: There was an attempted Zygon invasion before, in the seventies, eighties. One of"

411,started getting into fights.
412,Couple of them got killed. 
413,"KATE: More than a couple. What happened here?NORLANDER: After the murders, they started banding together. And then, one day,"
414,"one of them changed.KATE: Changed?NORLANDER: One of them was walking down West Main, and suddenly, it turned into a,"
415,a reptile.
416,(Kate finds a sketch of a Zygon.)NORLANDER: They just came for us. They turned into monsters and they came
417,"for us. And, and we couldn't fight them. You can't tell who's who."
418,They can turn your own family against you.(Kate calls up a photo on her phone.)
419,"KATE: Have you seen her?NORLANDER: Yeah, she was here. She was at the motel, asking questions. Before."

421,KATE: Where?

512,WALSH: Damn it. Damn it!
513,DOCTOR: This is pointless! Just let me go in and talk!
514,(They run round the church. Walsh shoots the lock off a side door.)
515,[Church]
516,
517,(Walsh and the Doctor enter a room with a strategy table laid out. There
518," are sets of hairy bundles on the floor, still sizzling with "
519,electricity.)
520,WALSH: They've executed my men.
521,DOCTOR: Where are the Zygons?WALSH: We need to bomb the hell out of this place. It's infested
522,"with these things. We can't tell who the enemy is any more, we can't"
523,"count them and we can't track them!DOCTOR: I'm not going to let you do that.WALSH: I just lost my men, I'll quite happily bomb the hell out of anywhere. We need to move. Strike's on its way.DOCTOR: I need to find Osgood.WALSH: You've got ten minutes."
524,(Walsh leaves. The Doctor is looking at the coloured blocks on the table when -)
525,OSGOOD : Help! Help!
526,DOCTOR: Osgood! Osgood! 
527,"(He stamps on the floor, looking for a trap door.)"
528,OSGOOD : Doctor!

537,[Basement]
538,
539,OSGOOD: Doctor! Doctor!
540,(The Doctor jumps down the ladder. and turns on a torch.)
541,DOCTOR: Osgood! 
542,"(A jet flies overhead. He finds her sitting, manacled.)"
543,DOCTOR: Got to get you out. They're going to bomb this place.
544,What do the Zygons want?
545,"OSGOOD: They're training, practising new skills. Doctor, what are you doing"
546,here? 
547,(He sonicks her manacles.)
548,"DOCTOR: Rescuing you. In quite a dashing way, I might add."
549,OSGOOD: They fled through the tunnels. They're going back to the UK. If
550,"you're here, they've got you out of the way. Who's left in the UK?"
551,DOCTOR: Clara.
552,"ZYGON: Clara!DOCTOR: Oh, hello.(Whee Boom! Rocks fall on top of the Zygon.)DOCTOR: They've started. So much for ten minutes. (Boom!)"
553,[Truth or Consequences]
554,
555,KATE: You found something? What? What do you want me to see?(Norlander opens a dumpster full of hair and sizzling electricity.)
556,"KATE: Oh, God. W-were those all people?(Sizzling sounds are coming from more dumpsters nearby.)"
557,
558,[Tunnel]
559,"(A lift arrives. Jac, Clara and some soldiers get out.)"
560,"JAC: It's an odd world nowadays, isn't it?CLARA: It's always been an odd world."
561,"JAC: Mmm. I mean, doesn't it feel, sometimes, that things are coming to"
562,an end? Everything's just going nuts.
563,"CLARA: You're middle-aged, that's what it is. No offence. Everybody"
564,middle-aged always thinks the world's about to come to an end. Hmm. Never
565,"does. It's here. Oh, my God. "
566,(Lots of Zygon tech.)
567,
568,[Aeroplane]
569,"The Zygon is wheeled in tied to a box trolley. The Doctor follows, on his phone.)"
570,"CLARA : Hi, this is Clara Oswald. I'm probably on the tube or in"
571,outer space. Leave a message!
572,"DOCTOR: Can you change your voicemail message, please, it's getting"
573,very boring.
574,(Osgood is behind him and sits down.)
575,"DOCTOR: Oh, I see you've accessorised it.OSGOOD: Yes."
576,DOCTOR: The old question marks.
577,OSGOOD: You used to wear question marks.
578,"DOCTOR: Oh, I know, yes, I did. "
579,OSGOOD: They were nice. Why don't you wear them any more?
580,"DOCTOR: Oh, I do. I've got question mark underpants. "
581,OSGOOD: Makes one wonder
582,what the question is. 
583,(The Doctor pulls up another chair and sits down.)
584,DOCTOR: Which one are you? Human or Zygon?
585,OSGOOD: I don't answer that question.
586,DOCTOR: Why not?
587,OSGOOD: Because there isn't a question to answer. I don't accept it. My
588,sister and I were the living embodiment of the peace we made.
589,I will give all the lives that I have to protect it. You want to know who I
590,"am, Doctor? I am the peace. I am Human and Zygon."
591,DOCTOR: Like a hybrid.
592,"OSGOOD: A hybrid, if you like."
593,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm proud to know you, Osgood. And I promise that I won't"
594,tell anyone that you're a human. Zygons need to keep the human original
595,alive to refresh the body print.
596,"If you were a Zygon, you'd've changed back within days of your sister's"
597,death.
598,"OSGOOD: Those were the old rules, before Zygons could pluck loved ones"
599,from your memory and wear their faces.
600,Zygons only need to keep the original alive if they need more
601,"information from them. If the interrogation is over, then the original"
602,can die.
603,
604,[Tunnel]
605,
606,(Faces illuminatied by red light.)
607,"JAC: Oh, my God. These are Zygon pods."
608,(Lots of large scaley things attached to the roof and walls.)CLARA: I think you might be right.
609,JAC: About what?
610,CLARA: The end of the world.
611,[Aeroplane]
612,(In the air. The Zygon roars.)
613,"DOCTOR: Bit of first-things-first-ness. What's your name? My name's. Well, you can call me the Doctor. But then you knew"
614,"that, didn't you? You want something. What is it?"
615,ZYGON: You are the President of the World?
616,DOCTOR: I suppose so.
617,ZYGON: We want the world.(The Zygons laughs.)
618,[Tunnel]
619,
620,(Troops march in from the lift.)
621,CLARA: Okay. It looks like whole buildings full of people have been pinched.
622,"In fact, it looks like a whole London full of people have been pinched."
623,"But we've got here early, they're still growing. We've have to"
624,neutralise these before they hatch.
625,Take your positions.(Gun bolts slide.)CLARA: Do you know what? I'm enjoying this.JAC: Clara. 
626,CLARA: What?JAC: We don't know that's what these are.
627,"CLARA: Oh, come on. These are eggs, or pods, or whatever. Look. "
628,(She pulls the membrane from one pod 'window'.)
629,"CLARA: Oh,"
630,"my God, that's me.JAC: I think we should wait."
631,"CLARA: Look, they're here. They're growing duplicates of us. We have"
632,to destroy them. I've seen this happen before. It happened to that little boy. They took
633,"his parents and then they took him.JAC: But I don't see how these are duplicates. That's not how Zygons work. They don't grow duplicates, they kidnap the originals. So these, these are the humans. Retreat. Retreat! This is a trap! This is an ambush!"
634,"(A large number of Zygons are there. Clara is calm and smiling slightly.)JAC: No. Oh, no, Miss Oswald, please. Please!CLARA: Kill the traitors.(Lots of screaming while Clara recalls what happened in Sandeep's flat.)CLARA [memory]: Is he okay?"
635,"(A Zygon stood behind Sandeep's Mum and zapped Clara, then her duplicate appeared.)CLARA-Z [memory]: Hello, Clara. My name is Bonnie. "
636,(The UNIT troops have been reduced to hairballs.)
637,
638,[Aeroplane]
639,
640,ZYGON: We want the truth of who we are to be
641,acknowledged. We want to live as ourselves.
642,At any cost. We want a home.
643,"DOCTOR: Well, you can't have the United Kingdom. There's already people"
644,"living there. They'll think you're going to pinch their benefits.ZYGON: We're already there, Doctor. The invasion's already taken"
645,"place, bit by bit, over the last year. We've won the first battle."
646,"And now, we are going to begin the war."
647,
648,[Sheriff's Office]
649,"(Kate is going through more files when Norlander comes in. It is night, 11.01 according to the clock. Insects are chirping.)"
650,"NORLANDER: There's hundreds more. They killed everybody.KATE: We have to find out what forms they took, how many of them there were. How did this happen? NORLANDER: Somebody once caught the briefest of glimpses of a Zygon in its proper"
651,"form. A child who hadn't learned to preserve its body print, who had"
652,been left alone to learn these things for itself. And then word went
653,round these primitives that we were monsters. 
654,"KATE: We?NORLANDER: There isn't any backup, is there? I just had to be sure.(Norlander transforms into a Zygon and reaches for Kate. In the UNIT safe house, Zygon-Clara is making a call.)"
655,CLARA-Z : Commander calling Truth or Consequences. What is your
656,"status? Repeat, Commander calling Truth or Consequences. What is"
657,your status?
658,  
659,"(Presumably the Kate who uses Zygon tech to reply is a Zygon, but we cannot be sure.)"
660,"KATE-Z: Commander, UNIT neutralised in North America. Truth or Consequences."
661,[UNIT Safe House]
662,
663,"CLARA-Z: Copy that.(She goes to the armoury and unlocks it, and takes a case from a rack. Then she logs into the computer and uses her phone.)"
664,CLARA-Z: Bonnie speaking. UNIT neutralised in the UK. More or less.
665,(The screen shows the position of the Doctor's plane returning to the UK. Clara-Z watches it from a cliff top and makes a call.)
666,[Aeroplane]
667,
668,ZYGON: Answer it. Say goodbye. This plane will never land.
669,DOCTOR: Really. Clara?
670,

672,CLARA-Z: Doctor.

678,
679,CLARA-Z: There you are. 
680,(The case contains a missile launcher. She puts her phone on speaker and takes it out to target the aeroplane.)
681,"DOCTOR : Clara, I'm glad you're okay. Listen."
682,CLARA-Z: You're breaking up. 
683,DOCTOR : The invasion has happened. You're probably surrounded by
684,"Zygons. Get to the Tardis, get yourself safe."
685,  
686,
687,[Aeroplane]
688,
689,"DOCTOR: And apparently my plane is never going to land, but let's see what"
690,we're going to do about that.

693,"CLARA-Z: I'm sorry, but Clara's dead. "
694,
