23, [Beacon Alpha One airlock]
24,
25,(Far out in space hangs a segmented structure built
26,solely to receive and transmit data across the space ways. A black
27,dart-shaped craft approaches it and docks. Three men carry boxes of
28,"equipment into the beacon. Outside the beacon, two space-walkers attach"
29,magnetic charges its hull and finally a rocket propulsion unit.) 
30,CAVEN: Dervish! Dervish! 
31,DERVISH: (a thin man) We've nearly finished. 
32,CAVEN: About time. 
33,DERVISH: My men are just coming. We'll detonate by radio beam. 
34,CAVEN: Right. Hurry it up. 
35,(All the men return to the ship. It undocks and moves away. Shortly
36,afterwards a radio signal is sent and beacon Alpha One goes KaBOOM!)

39,
40,(Another ship is travelling through space. This one
41,"is thin and wide, with military insignia V41-LO. The flight deck is"
42,split into an upper command bridge with silver-haired General Hermack
43,"in charge, and a lower technical area.) "
44,"HERMACK: Everything all right, Penn? "
45,(played by  Jack
46,May) 
47,"PENN: Fine, sir. "
48,(The young  George
49,Layton with a zapata moustache.) 
50,HERMACK: Fine. 
51,"WARNE: (American) You sent for me, sir? "
52,"HERMACK: Ah yes, Ian. Sit down. "
53,WARNE: Thank you. 
54,HERMACK: Any information on that beacon signal yet? 
55,"WARNE: No, sir. There's been no response to the secondary emergency"
56,circuits. either. 
57,"HERMACK: No, there wouldn't be. "
58,WARNE: Sir? 
59,HERMACK: What do you think has happened to that beacon? 
60,"WARNE: Well, it's difficult to say, sir. It could be a failure in the"
61,solar energy store. 
62,HERMACK: No. The emergency power would operate and we'd get a may day
63,signal. 
64,"WARNE: Well. Oh, you don't think this is a mechanical failure, sir? "
65,"HERMACK: No. No, I don't. These beacons are practically fool proof. "
66,WARNE: You got any ideas? 
67,"HERMACK: Yes, I have. And I must be right. Argonite! These beacons are"
68,almost entirely constructed of argonite. 
69,"WARNE: Of course, sir. What are you going to do about it? "
70,HERMACK: Attention all personnel. This is General Hermack. Your V-ship
71,is now fifty days and many billions of miles out from Earth. You're
72,entering the fourth sector of our galaxy. In this sector for some time
73,"now, Earth Government has been aware that a highly organised gang of"
74,"criminals have been roaming the space ways, and preying upon"
75,defenceless cargo ships. The main target of these criminals is
76,"argonite, the most valuable mineral known to man and so far only found"
77,on the planets of the Fourth Sector. A government space beacon marking
78,the approaches to the planet New Sarum has ceased transmitting its
79,"navigation signal. These beacons, as you know, are constructed of"
80,argonite. It is my belief that the criminals are attacking the
81,government navigation beacons and plundering the argonite. There can be
82,"no other explanation for its failure. This being the case, I have"
83,decided to abandon our present mission and to investigate the missing
84,beacon in the New Sarum sector. I want all section commanders on the
85,bridge at twenty hundred hours sector four solar time. Resume normal
86,duties until then. 
87,WARNE: There are eighteen space beacons quite scattered across this
88,"sector, sir. "
89,"HERMACK: Seventeen, Ian, until the one at New Sarum's replaced. "
90,WARNE: Seventeen. And they're millions of miles apart. So how can we be
91,sure which one the pirates are likely to attack next? 
92,HERMACK: We can't. 
93,"WARNE: Well, exactly. The odds are seventeen to one against us being in"
94,the right place at the right time. 
95,"HERMACK: Ah! With our speed, I think we can cut those odds a bit. Now,"
96,there are four beacons in the Pliny solar system here. That is where
97,we'll start our patrol.
98,
99,[Beacon Alpha Seven]
100,
101,(There is a dart-shaped craft docked to this beacon
102,now. It is the same routine as at Alpha One.) 
103,CAVEN: Come on! Speed it up. 
104,"DERVISH: Caven, I don't like this. "
105,CAVEN: Nobody's asking you to like it. Just get those scissor charges
106,laid into position. 
107,"DERVISH: If we attack any more beacons, we'll have the whole of the"
108,Interstellar Space Corps in this sector. 
109,"CAVEN: Look, as of this moment, the Space Corps has its hands full of"
110,trouble. Bush fire wars in three different sectors. There's never been
111,a better time for getting rich. 
112,"DERVISH: Right, lads. Now, we'll lay four charges along the main axis,"
113,then we'll attach booster charges around the hull. Okay. 
114,"CAVEN: You're a good engineer, Dervish. Just do your job and leave the"
115,"Space Corps to me, eh? "
116,DERVISH: Okay. But I worked ten years for Earth Government. 
117,CAVEN: You should've stayed with them. They'd have given you a pension.
118,
119,DERVISH: Attacking Government property is one crime they make sure
120,never pays. 
121,"CAVEN: Sixteen hundred tons of pure argonite pays all right, Dervish."
122,To me this is like a floating bank. 
123,(The charges are laid.)
124,
125, [V-Ship flight deck]
126,
127,"WARNE: What range are the forward scanners set for,"
128,Penn? 
129,"PENN: Fifteen hundred, sir. "
130,WARNE: Well reset them at two thousand. Right? 
131,"PENN: Very good, sir. "
132,WARNE: And keep a sharp eye on that screen. There are lots of rogue
133,asteroids in the Pliny system. 
134,"HERMACK: Oh, and one thing more. Make sure the Minnow ships are fully"
135,"fuelled, and put the detonation heads on their missiles. Report back as"
136,soon as that is done. 
137,"WARNE: We're approaching the Pliny system now, sir. We've made scanner"
138,contact with the four beacons. They're functioning normally. 
139,"HERMACK: Ah good. Now this planet Ta, here, is the main one in the"
140,system. We'll orbit here for a few weeks and see what happens. 
141,"WARNE: So that's Ta, huh? "
142,HERMACK: You've heard of it? 
143,WARNE: Yeah. It's the head quarters of the Issigri Mining Corporation.
144,The most productive planet in the entire galaxy. 
145,HERMACK: Madeleine Issigri has built quite a place there. Which is one
146,reason for basing ourselves in the Pliny system. 
147,"WARNE: Why's that a reason, sir? "
148,"HERMACK: Well, if we're out here long, Ian, the men will need somewhere"
149,for rest and recreation. Deep space sickness is the one thing we can't
150,chance. 
151,PENN: Major Warne. 
152,"WARNE: What is it, Penn? "
153,"PENN: I've got a contact, sir, at beacon Alpha Seven. "
154,"WARNE: Well, hold on it. Any identification? "
155,"PENN: No, sir. Too far away. "
156,"HERMACK: Ah, it's a space ship right enough. Check Central Flight"
157,"Information, Ian, and see if anyone should be out there. "
158,"WARNE: Right, sir. "
159,"HERMACK: Change course for beacon Alpha Seven. Bridge to Power Room, I"
160,want ten seconds main boost. 
161,"WARNE: According to Flight Information, sir, there should be no ships"
162,in the area within the next seventeen days. 
163,"HERMACK: Well, whoever they are, they've not yet reported to Central"
164,Flight Information. 
165,WARNE: Do you think it's the pirates? 
166,"HERMACK: Yes, it could be. Though some of these commercial flights"
167,"don't always like to report their whereabouts, for reasons of their"
168,"own. Anyway, we shall soon know."
169,"(Meanwhile, the pirate ship undocks from Alpha Seven.) "
170,"PENN: She's backing off, sir. "
171,HERMACK: Keep track of her. 
172,"PENN: She's moving quite fast, sir. "
173,WARNE: Got a good turn of speed for a commercial. 
174,HERMACK: Is beacon Alpha Seven still functioning? 
175,"WARNE: Yes, sir. Very strong signal. "
176,"HERMACK: Well, that's something. "
177,"WARNE: Maybe they were just picking up emergency supplies, sir. Some of"
178,these beacons do carry reserve medical and oxygen equipment. 
179,"PENN: Sir, I've got another signal coming in now. It's a UHF! "
180,WARNE: UHF? But that's reserved for demolition teams. 
181,"HERMACK: Well, put it on audio. "
182,"PENN: Yes, sir. "
183,(Beacon Alpha Seven explodes.) 
184,"PENN: Alpha Seven's broken up, sir. "
185,HERMACK: Ah. Right under our noses. Main boost. 
186,"PENN: Lost the beacon, sir. No more signal. "
187,"WARNE: No, there won't be. It's probably in a dozen separate bits by"
188,now. 
189,HERMACK: Keep full contact with that pirate ship. 
190,"PENN: Yes, sir. "
191,"HERMACK: At least we can be sure they don't get away. Ian, give me a"
192,projected arrival time. 
193,"WARNE: Three hours, sir. Maybe I can get a visual on the main scanner. "
194,"(The pirate ship appears on the viewscreen, towing beacon debris.) "
195,WARNE: There she is sir. And that's what's left of the beacon. 
196,"HERMACK: We've got them cold, Ian. We'll be onto them long before they"
197,get rid of that salvaged scrap. 
198,"WARNE: Yeah, providing she doesn't see us approaching, sir. "
199,HERMACK: They don't know 
200,PENN: That ship looks fast 
201,HERMACK: They don't know we're in the same area. What's wrong with the
202,scanner? 
203,"WARNE: Seem to be losing visual contact, sir. "
204,"PENN: The ship's moving away, sir. "
205,HERMACK: What? 
206,"PENN: Just started to go, and the beacon debris's going with her. "
207,"HERMACK: Hold that contact, Penn. "
208,"PENN: It's no good, sir. She's going too fast. "
209,HERMACK: They must have twice our speed!Â 
210,WARNE: Maybe the Minnows could hold her? 
211,HERMACK: Not at this distance. They haven't the fuel. 
212,"PENN: Lost contact, sir. "
213,"HERMACK: Oh, hold the same course. "
214,PENN: Sir. 
215,HERMACK: Keep searching. 
216,"WARNE: They must have attached rocket units to the beacon, sir, the way"
217,it moved off. 
218,HERMACK: Yes. They're very well organised. They cut the beacon into
219,"several manageable pieces by means of scissor charges, then shoot the"
220,bits off to some pre-arranged collection point. Very clever. 
221,WARNE: And quick. It cuts down the time they're at risk. And they just
222,burn out the Argonite at their leisure. 
223,"HERMACK: Ian, we shall have to rethink our tactics. We shall never"
224,catch them by normal patrol methods. 
225,"WARNE: What else can we do, sir? "
226,HERMACK: Man the beacons. 
227,WARNE: Man them? 
228,HERMACK: It's the only answer. We'll drop small parties of four or five
229,men on each beacon and give them rations and supplies for two months.
230,"Well, all these mark five beacons were designed as emergency survival"
231,centres. 
232,"WARNE: Yes sir, but I don't think anybody has ever tried living on"
233,them. Some of these beacons are pretty primitive. 
234,"HERMACK: I'm not interested in men's comfort, Major. Set course for the"
235,nearest beacon. 
236,"WARNE: Yes, sir."
237,
238, [Beacon Alpha Four] 
239,(A Lieutenant and four armed guards enter the
240,beacon with survival packs. Warne follows.) 
241,"WARNE: Here's your radio, Lieutenant. It's beamed automatically to main"
242,control. All you have to do in the event of trouble is press this
243,"button, right? "
244,"SORBA: (Dark) Don't worry, I'll press it. "
245,WARNE: Remember your main job here is to give us the earliest possible
246,"warning in the event of the pirate ship approaching, right? "
247,"SORBA: And after that, we fight them. "
248,"WARNE: After that, I think you'll have to, Joe. Good Luck. "
249,SORBA: Thank you. 
250,WARNE: See you in about six weeks. 
251,SORBA: I hope.
252,
253, [V-Ship flight deck]
254,
255,HERMACK: Set a course for Alpha Nine. 
256,"PENN: Very good, sir. "
257,WARNE: I told Lieutenant Sorba we'd be back in about six weeks. sir. 
258,HERMACK: Or much earlier if the pirates raid Alpha Four. How's morale
259,on the picket? 
260,"WARNE: Oh, it's pretty high, sir. I think they're hoping for the chance"
261,of a party. 
262,HERMACK: They understand they have to shoot on sight? 
263,"WARNE: Yes, sir, I told them. No, anybody poking their nose aboard"
264,Alpha Four will find plenty of trouble waiting for him.
265,
266,[Beacon Alpha Four]
267,
268,"(And with those words, the Tardis materialises in"
269,the beacon's computer bay. The soldiers are on the level below.) 
270,SORBA: Now we're going to be here for about six weeks. Settle down and
271,keep your eyes open. Take care about 
272,GUARD: Sir. 
273,SORBA: What? What are you doing here? Why aren't you in the observation
274,tower? 
275,"GUARD: There's something in the computer bay, sir. "
276,"SORBA: Something? Well, what do you mean by that? "
277,"GUARD: I heard something in there, sir. A noise. "
278,"SORBA: All right, we'd better check it out then. Come on."
279,
280,[Beacon Alpha Four computer bay]
281,
282,DOCTOR: Oh dear. 
283,ZOE: What's wrong? 
284,"DOCTOR: Well, I don't think we're quite where I expected. Never mind."
285,This looks very interesting. 
286,JAMIE: Interesting? A piece of old machinery? 
287,"DOCTOR: Yes. I've never seen a computer quite like this before, Jamie. "
288,ZOE: It looks like some sort of control room. 
289,"DOCTOR: Yes, but what does it control? "
290,JAMIE: Yeah. Well I think we'd better get out of here before somebody
291,catches us. 
292,ZOE: Good idea. There's a door here. 
293,"JAMIE: No, Zoe. I meant in the Tardis. "
294,"DOCTOR: Jamie, stop worrying. There's obviously nobody here. "
295,"JAMIE: Well, how do you know that? "
296,"DOCTOR: Well, this machine is programmed to operate by itself. "
297,"ZOE: Yes, but what does it do? "
298,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm not sure Zoe, but I think we're on an unmanned"
299,spacecraft in a fixed orbit. We're too far away from anywhere to be a
300,"weather satellite. Let's see what clues we can find through here, shall"
301,we? 
302,JAMIE: What's that? 
303,DOCTOR: What?
304,"(A floor panel lifts and Sorba starts shooting as the Doctor, Zoe and"
305,Jamie run out of the room.)
306,
307,[Beacon Alpha Four companionway]
308,
309,"JAMIE: Nobody here, eh? "
310,ZOE: Now what are we going to do? The Tardis is in there. 
311,DOCTOR: There's only one thing we can do. 
312,ZOE: What? 
313,DOCTOR: Run! 
314,"JAMIE: Well, maybe next time you'll listen to me. "
315,ZOE: If there is a next time. 
316,[Beacon Alpha Four computer bay]
317,
318,"SORBA: All right, there are only three of them and"
319,they can't get away. Hunt them down and don't forget. Shoot to kill.
320,
321, [Beacon Alpha Four airlock] 
322,(The pirates have arrived.) 
323,CAVEN: Alpha Four. Another present from the home planet's tax payers. 
324,DERVISH: Same procedure as last time? 
325,"CAVEN: Yes, Dervish. But now that you've had a little practice, get"
326,"those scissor charges laid a bit quicker, eh? "
327,(Energy weapons fire.) 
328,"DERVISH: Hey, what's that? Caven, those were blaster guns! "
329,CAVEN: Get the crew in here at the double. 
330, [Beacon Alpha Four]
331,
332,(Our heroes run along companionways sealing the
333,hatches behind them.) 
334,"JAMIE: Are you all right, Zoe? "
335,"ZOE: Yes, I think so. "
336,DOCTOR: That should hold them for a little while. 
337,ZOE: But why are they trying to kill us? We haven't done anything. 
338,JAMIE: No. 
339,"DOCTOR: I don't know, but we're certainly not stopping to find out. "
340,JAMIE: What's that? Look. 
341,(A welding torch is cutting through the hatch.) 
342,DOCTOR: Come on. Let's find somewhere else to hide. 
343,(They go further on and secure another hatch.) 
344,"JAMIE: Doctor, there's no way out of here. "
345,DOCTOR: What? 
346,JAMIE: Look! 
347,"ZOE: Oh Doctor, what can we do? "
348,"DOCTOR: Well, I don't know. If we go down there we'll bump straight"
349,into them. I'm afraid we're trapped. 
350,(Sorba's men have cut through the first hatch.) 
351,"SORBA: All right, this way. "
352,(The pirates shoot the soldiers in the back. Sorba is shot and he falls
353,while pressing the call button on his radio.)
354,
355, [V-Ship flight deck]
356,
357,"PENN: Thirty minutes from beacon Alpha Three, sir. "
358,"HERMACK: Right. Warn the picket to stand by on C deck, Ian. "
359,"WARNE: Right, sir. "
360,"PENN: Emergency from Beacon Alpha Four, sir! "
361,WARNE: Sorba's being attacked. 
362,HERMACK: Set course for Alpha Four. Try and get me a visual on the
363,"scanner, Ian. "
364,"PENN: On course, sir. "
365,HERMACK: Bridge to Power House. I want main boost for as long as you
366,can hold it without vapourising the motors.
367,
368, [Beacon Alpha Four companionway]
369,
370,CAVEN: This one's still alive. 
371,"DERVISH: So the Space Corps were too busy to bother about us, eh? "
372,CAVEN: Shut up! I'm thinking. 
373,DERVISH: There's no time for thinking. We've got to get out of here. 
374,CAVEN: Four space Guards and an officer. What are they doing here? 
375,DERVISH: There must be a cruiser in the area. 
376,CAVEN: Not a big enough crew to defend the beacon but they must have
377,been put on board for a reason. 
378,(Caven sees a box lying beside Sorba.) 
379,CAVEN: What's this? 
380,"DERVISH: It looks like a fixed beam transmitter. Why, that's it. Well,"
381,they'll be on their way back here by now. 
382,CAVEN: Then you'd better get moving. 
383,"DERVISH: Well, you don't still want the beacon cutting up? "
384,CAVEN: That's what we came here to do. 
385,DERVISH: Think about it! 
386,CAVEN: Don't waste time. Get on with it. 
387,(Caven shoots the transmitter.)
388,
389, [V-Ship flight deck]
390,
391,"WARNE: Could be their radio's packed up, sir. "
392,HERMACK: Yes. Give me a projected arrival time. 
393,WARNE: Two hours twenty minutes. 
394,HERMACK: I should have left a stronger picket. 
395,"WARNE: Oh no, sir. We haven't the man power. Besides Sorba knew he"
396,could only hope to delay things. 
397,HERMACK: I am going to get that gang of murdering thieves if I have to
398,spend the next ten years out here.
399,
400, [Beacon Alpha Four companionway]
401,
402,(Sorba wakes.) 
403,"CAVEN: Yes, Lieutenant, you're the last of the toy soldiers. "
404,SORBA: Shot in the back. 
405,CAVEN: You mean we're disqualified. You don't want to play any more? 
406,"SORBA: You can laugh now, but you won't get away with this. "
407,"CAVEN: Who's going to stop me, Lieutenant? "
408,SORBA: How did you get those decoys aboard? 
409,CAVEN: Decoys? 
410,SORBA: Those three that lead us into your ambush. 
411,"CAVEN: Concussion, lieutenant? Or stalling for time? "
412,SORBA: You know who I'm talking about. They ran off into the aft
413,companionway. 
414,CAVEN: None of my men down there. Must be some of yours. 
415,SORBA: Sure. We were having a private training session with loaded
416,thermite guns. 
417,CAVEN: We did hear firing in the airlock. You mean there really is
418,someone else in there? 
419,SORBA: I thought you'd planted them there. 
420,"CAVEN: Whoever they are, we've got no time to bother with them now. "
421,DERVISH: I've laid the charges. Just fixing the rockets. 
422,"CAVEN: Good. If he can walk, get him out of here. If he can't, leave"
423,him. 
424,(Caven shoots the lock of the hatch.) 
425,DERVISH: What are you doing? 
426,"CAVEN: Just sealing a coffin, Dervish."
427,
428, [Beacon Alpha Four compartment].
429,
430,(On the other side of the hatch.) 
431,JAMIE: I wish I could hear what they're saying. 
432,ZOE: I think they're trying to burn through it. 
433,DOCTOR: Just a minute. I think they've gone away. 
434,ZOE: I don't understand. Why didn't they come in here after us? 
435,"JAMIE: Aye, they must've known we were trapped. Why not finish us off? "
436,"DOCTOR: They didn't seem very friendly, did they? Oh! "
437,JAMIE: What's the matter? 
438,"DOCTOR: Well, it's hot. You try. "
439,"JAMIE: Ah. No, thank you. "
440,ZOE: I told you they were trying to burn through it. 
441,"JAMIE: Well, why haven't they? "
442,(They hear a clang.) 
443,ZOE: What's that? 
444,(Another clang.) 
445,DOCTOR: There's something moving out there. 
446,ZOE: It sounds as if somebody's on the hull. 
447,(The pirates are fastening the charges and propulsion units.) 
448,JAMIE: What are they doing? 
449,DOCTOR: I don't know Jamie. Perhaps they're cleaning the windows. 
450,JAMIE: Oh. Eh? 
451,"ZOE: Look, why don't we sneak back to the Tardis and get out of here? "
452,"JAMIE: Aye, while we've still got the chance. "
453,"DOCTOR: A sensible idea, Zoe. You're sure there's nobody out there? "
454,ZOE: I haven't heard anybody for ages. Come on. 
455,"DOCTOR: Mind out, it's hot. "
456,"ZOE: Well, it's not hot any more. "
457,DOCTOR: What? 
458,ZOE: I can't unlock it. 
459,"JAMIE: Let me do it, Zoe. You'll have to eat more porridge. "
460,"DOCTOR: Jamie, I don't think it's any use. You know what I think"
461,they've done? 
462,JAMIE: What? 
463,DOCTOR: They've welded the lock! We're prisoners!

469,WARNE: It's exactly what happened before. 
470,HERMACK: What is our arrival time? 
471,"PENN: Still ninety minutes to go, sir. "
472,HERMACK: We are going to be too late again! 
473,WARNE: The beacon should blow any second now.

482,"HERMACK: Penn, give me a bearing on that pirate"
483,ship. 
484,"PENN: I can't pick her up, sir. "
485,HERMACK: What? 
486,PENN: The debris from that beacon's jammed the signals. 
487,"HERMACK: Oh Penn, you are an incompetent, useless "
488,"WARNE: Keep trying, Penn. "
489,"PENN: Yes, sir. "
490,(Warne joins Hermack at the coffee machine at the side of the bridge
491,section.) 
492,"HERMACK: Ah, coffee? "
493,"WARNE: Yes please, sir. Thank you. "
494,"HERMACK: All right, I know. The men are doing their best. "
495,WARNE: General? 
496,HERMACK: Isn't that what you were going to say? 
497,"WARNE: Something like that, yeah. "
498,HERMACK: You see? They're moving out of range already. 
499,"WARNE: If only we could have sustained continual main boost, it might"
500,have been a different story. They must have a base somewhere in this
501,system. We're more than fifty days out from home planet. 
502,HERMACK: Quite. They can have main boost the whole time. Our only
503,chance is getting close enough to launch the Minnows. 
504,WARNE: Or locate their base. They must have dispatched pieces of that
505,beacon to it. If we could just locate one of the pieces. 
506,"HERMACK: Can't be done. If those auxiliary rockets cut out, we've"
507,nowhere to track on. You see? There's nothing left now. 
508,"WARNE: We've got the tactile scanner, sir. "
509,HERMACK: That would be like looking for a single speck of dust at the
510,bottom of an argonite mine. 
511,WARNE: Do you think there's any chance they're still alive out there? 
512,HERMACK: You mean Sorba's men? 
513,WARNE: Yeah. 
514,HERMACK: I doubt it. I doubt if anyone's alive on that beacon now. 
515,"(As the sections of the beacon float along in formation, three figures"
516,lie unconscious in the rearmost one.) 
517,PENN: Major Warne! 
518,"WARNE: What is it, Penn? "
519,"PENN: Rocket ship, sir. "
520,WARNE: Are you sure? 
521,"PENN: No doubt of it, sir, and she's right in the area where beacon"
522,Alpha Four went up. 
523,"WARNE: Right, can I get it on the TS? "
524,"PENN: We should be able to, sir. Bearing starboard nineteen from SDC. "
525,WARNE: Nineteen SDC. 
526,"HERMACK: What is it, Ian? "
527,"WARNE: Something on the radar, sir. "
528,HERMACK: The pirates? 
529,"WARNE: Well, if it is, there's something wrong with their ship. She's"
530,hardly moving. 
531,HERMACK: But they don't even know we're in the same area. 
532,"WARNE: Oh I don't know, sir. They must be aware that there's a V-ship"
533,in the system. They ran into our picket on Alpha Four. Which is why.
534,"somehow, I don't think this could be their ship. "
535,"HERMACK: But according to flight information, there should be nothing"
536,in this solar system for the next eighty hours. 
537,(Warne gets an image on a rear monitor.) 
538,"WARNE: There she is, sir. And that isn't the ship we saw before. "
539,"HERMACK: No, it isn't. Can you get a closer shot? "
540,"WARNE: That's one of the old C-class freighters, sir. I didn't know"
541,they were still flying.

545,"(This ship is homely, with a jacket slung over the"
546,back of the captain's chair. A hot hard-boiled bell rings and an egg
547,drops out of a dispenser chute. A space cowboy in checked shirt and
548,neckerchief enters singing 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'.
549,Think the sort of character Gabby
550,Hayes used to play. He puts the egg in an egg cup and sits in
551,his chair with the full breakfast tray on his lap. Smoke comes out of a
552,toaster. He throws away the charcoal offering.) 
553,MILO: The last of me nutty sliced bread. Rubbishy new-fangled solar
554,toasters! 
555,(The lights go dim. He thumps a panel and they come up again.) 
556,MILO: Ah. That's better. 
557,"(Just as he is taking the top off his egg, the Call light flashes. Milo"
558,puts on a headset.) 
559,HERMACK : This is V forty one. V forty one calling LIZ seventy
560,"nine. LIZ seven nine, can you hear me? "
561,"MILO: LIZ seventy nine. LIZ seventy nine. I can hear you, V forty one."
562,Go away! 
563,HERMACK : What? Now listen. This is General Nikolai Hermack.
564,Commander of the Space First Division. Give me your identity
565,registration. 
566,"MILO: A general, a real general. Oh, General, why don't you take"
567,yourself off? I'm trying to have my breakfast.
568,
569, [V-Ship flight deck]
570,
571,"HERMACK: LIZ seventy nine, give me your identity"
572,registration. That is an order. 
573,"MILO : Oh come on, General, I lost that thing about thirty years"
574,ago. Why don't you go about your business and leave me alone. 
575,(Warne gets the data up on a monitor.) 
576,"WARNE: That's LIZ seventy nine's registration, sir. She's a real"
577,old-timer. She's been afloat for about forty years. 
578,HERMACK: Milo Clancey! I might have known. 
579,"WARNE: You know him, sir? "
580,"HERMACK: Of him. Out in Reja Magnum, where I did my first tour, he was"
581,something of a legend. Milo Clancey! I have your identity registration
582,here. 
583,"MILO : I'm very glad for you, General. That's great work. That's"
584,"very good. Now, good day. "
585,"HERMACK: Listen, Clancey. Where are you from and where are you bound? "
586, [LIZ 79]
587,
588,"MILO: Might I ask, General, what in tarnations"
589,business that might be of yours? 
590,"HERMACK : Clancey, I'm coming alongside with a boarding party. I"
591,"warn you, don't try and resist. "
592,"MILO: I won't tangle with you, General. You come on in and join the"
593,"party. Oh, and mind you don't scratch your nice shiny white paint."

597,"(The Doctor wakes, and shakes Jamie.) "
598,"DOCTOR: Jamie, Jamie. "
599,(The Doctor drags one of a pair of gas cylinders over to Zoe and
600,Jamie.)
601,
602, [V-Ship flight deck]
603,
604,"WARNE: I've sent a guard aboard, sir, to pick up"
605,Clancey. I don't think he'll give us any trouble. 
606,"HERMACK: Yes. Well, he won't co-operate though. Ian, have you ever run"
607,across any of these old-timers? 
608,"WARNE: No, sir. "
609,HERMACK: They think they're a law unto themselves. They don't like the
610,Space Corps either. 
611,WARNE: Why? 
612,"HERMACK: Well, these old mining prospectors like Clancey were the first"
613,men to go out into deep space. For a time they had the place to
614,"themselves, roaming the spaceways, looking for planets, jumping each"
615,"other's claims. They were a wild breed, Ian, and they learned to live"
616,without the law. 
617,IAN: And then the Space Corps came along and started to enforce law and
618,"order, right? "
619,"HERMACK: Yes, much to their resentment. Clancey must be the last of the"
620,type. 
621,(Milo enters.) 
622,"MILO: My, my, my. Well, they certainly do you slickers proud, don't"
623,they. It's like a whole floating fun palace up here. 
624,"HERMACK: Clancey, I am General Hermack. "
625,MILO: Howdy! 
626,"HERMACK: And this is Major Warne, my ADC. "
627,MILO: Major? 
628,HERMACK: What are you doing in this system and why you are not on
629,feedback to Central Flight Information? 
630,"MILO: Oh, am I not, General? "
631,HERMACK: No. 
632,"MILO: Oh, no, you're right. You're right. I remember now. That old"
633,"feedback of mine, it just sort of fell to bits about five year ago now."
634,
635,HERMACK: Five years? 
636,MILO: Or could it be ten? Yep. Certainly could be ten. I've been always
637,meaning to get that thing fixed. 
638,WARNE: You know it's an offence to operate without a feedback to CFI? 
639,MILO: An offence? 
640,WARNE: Right. 
641,"MILO: I didn't realise that, sonny, no. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear."
642,There are so many offences these days. 
643,"HERMACK: Clancey, what are you doing in this system? "
644,"MILO: Well, I am the head of the Milo Clancey Space Mining Company. "
645,"HERMACK: Yes, we know all about that. We have your identity"
646,registration here. 
647,"MILO: Oh, that must be great for you, General, to have all of those"
648,facts at your fingertips like that. 
649,"HERMACK: Get to the point, Clancey. "
650,MILO: You would know the point if you'd been reading my reports I've
651,been sending to you the last two years. 
652,WARNE: What do you mean? 
653,"MILO: Argonite pirates, that's what I mean, sonny. "
654,"HERMACK: Go on, Clancey. "
655,"MILO: Over the last two years, I have lost five floaters carrying"
656,"argonite ore back to home planet. They were hijacked, General, and they"
657,were brought into this system. 
658,"WARNE: You reported this, you say? "
659,"MILO: Ah, aye, I reported this, sonny. About a dozen times I reported"
660,"it but it didn't do me any good, did it. So I said to myself, all"
661,"right, all righty, I'll just have to do something about this myself. "
662,HERMACK: How much argonite did you have on each floater? 
663,MILO: I had a full load. Fifty thousand tons unrefined ore. 
664,WARNE: What makes you so sure your floaters were bought into this
665,system? 
666,"MILO: Time, sonny, time. This system is the closest to where they left"
667,"the spaceway. And my old floaters, they've got no propulsion units."
668,"They're unmanned. They don't move very fast, sonny. "
669,WARNE: I know that! 
670,"MILO: Oh, he's a good lad. He's a bright lad, this boy of yours. Good"
671,"thinking. Is it all right if I blow my nose, or is that another"
672,offence? My old nose. I can't get used to all your fancy
673,air-conditioning. 
674,"HERMACK: That's a pity, Clancey, but I'm afraid you'll have to put up"
675,"with it a bit longer. Now, how long have you been in the area of beacon"
676,Alpha Four? 
677,MILO: Beacon Alpha Four? 
678,HERMACK: Yes. 
679,"MILO: Oh. Have you a chart, General? "
680,HERMACK: Here. 
681,"MILO: Oh, that's where we are. Well, well, well. You see, my charts"
682,don't pick up these new fanged beacons. I don't trust them. 
683,"WARNE: Just an astral pointer and a piece of string, huh? "
684,"MILO: That is right, sonny. Hey listen, I can't see beacon Alpha Four"
685,here either. That's what I'm telling you. They're unreliable. They're a
686,waste of public money. 
687,HERMACK: Beacon Alpha Four is not registering because it's not there
688,any more. 
689,WARNE: The argonite pirates blew it up three hours ago. 
690,"MILO: Oh, did they so. That'd be for salvage I guess. Yeah, that would"
691,be it. 
692,"HERMACK: You don't seem very surprised, Clancey. "
693,"MILO: No, no, I'm not, General. This is clearing up a whole heap of"
694,things in my head. I can lose every floater I've got and your fancy
695,Space Corps won't do a thing about it. But the government loses one
696,government beacon and that's a different matter. Then you come running.
697,That's what you're here now for 
698,"HERMACK: Well, if there is any truth in your story, Clancey, and we do"
699,"catch up with the pirates, you'll be entitled to put in a claim for"
700,compensation. 
701,"MILO: If I waited for you to catch these critters, I'd catch my death"
702,of cold waiting forever. I should think this old crate of yours has
703,"about half the speed of a Beta Dart, right? "
704,WARNE: Our speed is classified information. 
705,"MILO: Oh, that may be, sonny, but this marauding band of sharks, you"
706,"know they're using Beta Darts, one of the latest. You're in the wrong"
707,"league, boys. Why don't you just go home where you came from. "
708,WARNE: How do you know what ship they have? 
709,MILO: Because I crossed their thieving flight path a couple of times.
710,And if my old
711,"Liz had any speed about her, I'd have rammed them."
712,
713,[Beacon Alpha Four compartment]
714,
715,(The Doctor is standing on a box and looking
716,through a porthole in the ceiling.) 
717,"ZOE: Can you see anything, Doctor? "
718,DOCTOR: I'm coming down. Look out. 
719,"JAMIE: Well, what's on the other side? Could you see? "
720,"DOCTOR: Jamie, I'm afraid that there's nothing on the other side. Just"
721,space. It appears that this machine we're on has been blown into about
722,eight separate pieces. 
723,ZOE: Are you sure? 
724,"DOCTOR: Well, of course I'm sure. Get up and look for yourself if you"
725,don't believe me. 
726,ZOE: Then that must have been the explosion. 
727,"JAMIE: Doctor, does that mean the Tardis is gone? "
728,"DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie. "
729,JAMIE: That means we'll never get it back. 
730,ZOE: I don't understand. Why would anybody want to blow up a space
731,machine? 
732,DOCTOR: Sabotage perhaps. 
733,ZOE: But what about those men that tried to killed us? 
734,DOCTOR: I think they were here to defend the machine. That would
735,explain why they were so unfriendly towards us. 
736,"JAMIE: Well, what you're saying is that we've landed ourselves in the"
737,middle of some sort of war in space. 
738,ZOE: Now we're just floating aimlessly on a bit of debris. 
739,"DOCTOR: No, Zoe, not aimlessly. There appear to be rockets attached to"
740,each part of the machine. And they're all moving along together. 
741,JAMIE: Hey? 
742,"DOCTOR: Well, as you know, Jamie, when something explodes in space, all"
743,"the pieces separate and go on separating indefinitely, but this machine"
744,"has separated just so far, perhaps a mile, and now, as I say, they're"
745,all moving together at the same speed. 
746,"ZOE: Because of the rockets. Oh, I see. So whoever broke up the machine"
747,is sending all the pieces to the same place? 
748,"DOCTOR: It looks like it, Zoe. "
749,"JAMIE: Oh, so we can get back to the Tardis then? If it's only a mile"
750,away. 
751,"DOCTOR: A mile in space, Jamie, with no oxygen or means of propulsion. "
752,ZOE: It might just as well be a thousand miles. 
753,"JAMIE: Oh, that's just fine then. "
754,"ZOE: Have you got an idea, Doctor? "
755,"DOCTOR: Shush, shush. Just a minute. "
756,(There is a buzzing sound.) 
757,DOCTOR: Now what on earth is that?
758,
759,[V- Ship flight deck]
760,
761,"MILO: Oh lookie here, General. If you've finished"
762,"with all your fool questions, I've got work to do. I want to get back"
763,to my ship. 
764,"HERMACK: All right, Clancey, I'm sorry to have detained you. "
765,WARNE: Sir? 
766,"MILO: What? What, you mean I can go? "
767,HERMACK: Of course. 
768,MILO: That's great. That's very kind of you. I'll just say goodbye
769,"then, General. Goodbye. "
770,(Milo leaves with an escort.) 
771,"WARNE: The navigators are standing by for orders, sir. "
772,HERMACK: Obviously you think I've done the wrong thing. 
773,"WARNE: It's not for me to say, General. "
774,HERMACK: You think I let Clancey go too easily. 
775,"WARNE: I would have put him through the mind probe, sir. "
776,HERMACK: That did occur to me. He does seem to be mixed up with these
777,argonite pirates. 
778,WARNE: Too much. 
779,HERMACK: You think he's in league with them? 
780,"WARNE: It's possible, sir. You said he's no respecter of the law. That"
781,story about floaters and pirates could have just been a cover story. 
782,HERMACK: I quite agree. 
783,"WARNE: You agree, sir? "
784,"HERMACK: Oh yes, Ian. Not only do I think that Milo Clancey is in"
785,"league with the argonite pirates, I think he is the mastermind behind"
786,"the whole organisation, which is precisely why I let him go"
787,
788,[Beacon Alpha Four compartment]
789,
790,(The Doctor prises open an equipment cover and
791,frowns.) 
792,"JAMIE: Oh, what's he doing now? "
793,ZOE: I've no idea. Ask him. 
794,"JAMIE: Oh, what's the use? He's got his mysterious face on. "
795,"ZOE: Well, I think he's just trying to keep our hopes up. "
796,JAMIE: Hopes? 
797,ZOE: By looking busy. There's nothing anyone can do now. I'd say we've
798,got a few hours at the outside. 
799,JAMIE: What do you mean by a few hours? 
800,"ZOE: Well, haven't you noticed, Jamie? Haven't you noticed how"
801,difficult it is to breathe properly now?

830,"ZOE: Oh Doctor, can we have some more oxygen? "
831,"DOCTOR: I'm afraid not, Zoe. We've got to conserve it. "
832,"JAMIE: Oh, what's the use. We'll never get out of this. "
833,"DOCTOR: Come here, both of you. Look. Look at these. "
834,JAMIE: What are they? 
835,DOCTOR: They're solar powered magnets. It's a force field. 
836,JAMIE: Hey? 
837,"DOCTOR: Well, don't you see. The explosive charges that blew this"
838,machine apart didn't damage its structure. They simply divided it along
839,the lines of its electromagnetic fields. 
840,ZOE: How do you know? 
841,DOCTOR: Because there was no damage to the structure. 
842,ZOE: You mean the machine was built in separate sections and assembled
843,in space by magnetism. 
844,"DOCTOR: Yes, you see, Jamie, opposite poles attract and the same poles"
845,repel. 
846,(The Doctor demonstrates with a pair of magnets on strings from his
847,pocket.) 
848,DOCTOR: You see? Try it. There. 
849,"ZOE: Oh, so the explosion was just strong enough to break the magnetic"
850,attraction between each section? 
851,DOCTOR: Yes. 
852,"JAMIE: But that doesn't do us any good, does it? "
853,"DOCTOR: But it just might, Jamie. Supposing I could step up the"
854,electromagnetic power enough to bridge the space between this section
855,and the next. 
856,ZOE: You mean draw it towards us. 
857,"DOCTOR: Yes, and then repeat the process with each section and so on"
858,until we reach the Tardis! 
859,"JAMIE: Hey, well, do you think you could do it? "
860,"DOCTOR: Well, I've got a screwdriver. "
861,JAMIE: Oh. 
862,DOCTOR: And I've got a slight knowledge of electromagnetism. 
863,"ZOE: Yes, there's just one thing, Doctor. "
864,"DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie, would you move this cylinder out of the way? "
865,ZOE: How do you know the next section to this one is an opposite pole? 
866,"DOCTOR: Well I don't, Zoe. "
867,"ZOE: Well, if it's similar, your idea won't work, will it? We'll just"

881,HERMACK: It is. Thank you. But then after a week you get quite used to
882,it. 
883,MADELEINE: I thought so. LIZ seventy nine is Milo Clancey's ship. 
884,HERMACK: Your records are very comprehensive. 
885,MADELEINE: Why is he being followed? 
886,"HERMACK: Well, I explained to you the purpose of this mission. I"
887,believe that Clancey has connection with the argonite pirates. 
888,MADELEINE: That seems unlikely. 
889,"HERMACK: Oh, why? "
890,MADELEINE: He has argonite mines on the planet Lobos. 
891,HERMACK: Which I hear are pretty well worked out. 
892,"MADELEINE: They used to say this planet was worked out, but I brought"
893,in new machinery and today it's the most productive in the galaxy. 
894,"HERMACK: I must say, I'm surprised to find you of all people defending"
895,Clancey. 
896,MADELEINE: Why? 
897,"HERMACK: Well, because of the rumours connecting him with the death of"
898,"your father, Dom Issigri. "
899,"MADELEINE: Well, I tried to prove that at the time but nobody knows"
900,"what happened between them, so now I prefer to forget it. "
901,HERMACK: But you took over the argonite holdings from your father and
902,split away from Clancey. 
903,MADELEINE: Yes. 
904,HERMACK: And now you run the most successful argonite mining business
905,"in the galaxy, while Clancey, because of your competition must be"
906,pretty nearly bankrupt. 
907,MADELEINE: Is that why you think he's taken up with piracy? 
908,"HERMACK: Well, jealousy of your great success would be a pretty strong"
909,"motive. Unless of course, you disagree. "
910,"MADELEINE: Oh, you may be right. But I haven't seen him since the day"
911,"the partnership was dissolved, so well, I don't know what he feels. "
912,"HERMACK: Well, I can understand it. For a man like Clancey to be"
913,"defeated by an attractive woman like you at his own game, he'd take any"
914,risk to get his revenge. 
915,"MADELEINE: Well, I wouldn't like to think that that was true. "
916,"HERMACK: Your concern does you credit, but I'm convinced I shall have"
917,the proof I need within a few hours. 
918,MADELEINE: Really? How? 
919,HERMACK: Warne has reported that Clancey is still on the same
920,dimensional orbit as he was when we left him. Obviously he's expecting
921,a rendezvous. 
922,MADELEINE: With a pirate ship? 
923,HERMACK: I think so.

937,you two had better hold on. Are you ready?

1287,"MILO: Well, you see, Madeleine Issigri, who runs that show now, she's a"
1288,"sworn enemy of mine. Well, so I've been told. Anyway, General Hermack"
1289,will think I'll go anywhere else rather than go there. 
1290,"DOCTOR: Yes, but if she's a sworn enemy, won't she give you away? "
1291,"MILO: We won't be announcing our arrival, Doctor. We'll just lie low"
1292,there until that old Space Corps gets tired of looking for us. 
1293,ZOE: It doesn't look as though there's anything there. This side is
1294,just desert. 
1295,"MILO: No, no, there's no surface life on Ta, girl. There's too much"
1296,"ultra-violet radiation. Don't you worry, don't you worry. We'll be all"
1297,right. We'll be a mile underground as long as I can fall into my old
1298,landing pad. 
1299,"DOCTOR: Oh, you've been there before, have you? "
1300,"MILO: Certainly have, certainly have. Me and my old partner, Dom"
1301,"Issigri, god rest his poor tired old soul, we turned that whole planet"
1302,into a piece of Gruyere cheese between us. 
1303,JAMIE: Gruyere cheese. 
1304,"DOCTOR: Jamie, here. Mining! I see. For argonite, presumably. "
1305,"MILO: Yeah, that's right, argonite. One of the richest strikes we ever"
1306,"found. Took us about ten years to drill that clean. Well, I'd better"
1307,"try to find this old entry shaft then. Now, you'd better brace"
1308,yourselves. Hang onto something. My landing pad's ain't as good as they
1309,used to be.

1315,"you there, Penn. "
1316,"PENN : Yes, sir. "
1317,"MADELEINE: I'm sorry your stay was so short, General. "
1318,"HERMACK: Well, I hope on my next visit, my duties will be less"
1319,pressing. 
1320,MADELEINE: So do I. Where do you go from now? 
1321,"HERMACK: Well, first of all I must get young Warne out of that fix he's"
1322,got himself into. Then I must collect my pickets from the beacons. And
1323,"after that, Lobos."
1324,MADELEINE: Lobos! 
1325,HERMACK: Hmm mmm. 
1326,MADELEINE: Milo Clancey's base? 
1327,HERMACK: The pirate's base. Those beacons they've been breaking up will
1328,"be heading there. With a little bit of luck, we shall be able to wipe"
1329,out the whole nest in one operation. 
1330,"MADELEINE: Well, I hope you do. Some of my crews are demanding arms in"
1331,case they're attacked. 
1332,"(On his way to the door, Hermack notices a model of a sleek black"
1333,spaceship.) 
1334,"HERMACK: Is that a, is that a Beta Dart? "
1335,"MADELEINE: Yes. Yes, our company's just bought two. They're our fastest"
1336,freighters. 
1337,HERMACK: Ah. I must bear that in mind. The pirates have a Beta Dart. I
1338,should hate to knock out one of your ships by mistake. 
1339,MADELEINE: Well I don't think that's likely. All our freighters show
1340,the Issigri nose-cone when they're in commission. 
1341,(She slides a pattern nose cone onto the model.) 
1342,MADELEINE: I designed it myself. 
1343,"HERMACK: Ah, very distinctive. How much does it cost? "
1344,"MADELEINE: Oh, a hundred million credits upwards. Depends on the"
1345,fittings. Why do you ask? 
1346,HERMACK: I was just wondering where Milo Clancey got a hundred million
1347,credits. 
1348,MADELEINE: I see. You think he got it by selling the stolen argonite. 
1349,HERMACK: Why not? It's logical. There's an illicit market for them on
1350,"Rita Magnum, I hear. "
1351,"MADELEINE: Yes, but I'm sure you're wrong about Milo Clancey. "
1352,HERMACK: Are you? I'm not. He's selling the stuff and professing
1353,"poverty as a cover. If I find those beacons sections on line for Lobos,"
1354,he'll not live to enjoy his money.

1363,JAMIE: Smooth? What do you call a rough landing? 
1364,"MILO: What's the matter with you, sonny? Are you getting soft or"
1365,something? 
1366,"JAMIE: Just let me get my feet back on the ground, that's all. "
1367,"MILO: You stay right here where you're safe, boy. "
1368,JAMIE: Safe? Is that what you call this? 
1369,DOCTOR: You want us to stay here? 
1370,MILO: Yeah. I'm thinking of your own safety. 
1371,JAMIE: Why? 
1372,"MILO: Well, we're a mile underground here. This is the old freighter"
1373,"dock. And there's nothing to see, there's nowhere to go, it's just a"
1374,"whole maze of argonite tunnels, and if you go in there, well, even I"
1375,mayn't be able to find you again. You stay right here in this ship. 
1376,"DOCTOR: Just a minute, where are you going? "
1377,MILO: I've got to go to the generator room. I think one of their
1378,rockets must have gone through my transmitter unit. That radio there's
1379,whistling like some sort of hysterical canary. 
1380,(Milo leaves with his tool bag.) 
1381,"JAMIE: Doctor, do you believe him? "
1382,"DOCTOR: I don't know, Jamie. What do you think? "
1383,"JAMIE: Well, he never did explain how he turned up the way he did, did"
1384,he? And that Space Corp ship was chasing him. 
1385,"DOCTOR: True. But I think we've got to trust him, Jamie. If we leave"
1386,"this ship, we'll never ever have a chance of finding the Tardis again. "
1387,"JAMIE: Well I don't see we've got much of a chance anyway. Look, it's"
1388,up there in space somewhere on a bit of that beacon heading for I don't
1389,know where. 
1390,"DOCTOR: A blast furnace, I imagine. I think I think the pirates are"
1391,probably going to take the pieces and melt them down for the for the
1392,"argonite. The trouble is, we can't guess where their headquarters is. "
1393,"ZOE: There's no need to guess, Doctor. It's easy enough to work out. "
1394,DOCTOR: What? 
1395,ZOE: Applied mathematics. 
1396,"DOCTOR: Applied? Oh, I see. You've been messing about again, have you? "
1397,"ZOE: Oh well, if you don't want to know what I've discovered. "
1398,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. Come along, surprise us. "
1399,ZOE: This was the position of our bit of beacon when Milo first saw us.
1400,I got the figures from the computer. 
1401,DOCTOR: Oh yes. 
1402,ZOE: And this was our position eight minutes later when he docked along
1403,side. 
1404,"DOCTOR: Yes, circle fourteen. Yes, go on. "
1405,"ZOE: Well, from this data it was simple enough to work out our original"
1406,position and course. Do you see? 
1407,"DOCTOR: Yes, except that after my little experiment, we veered rather"
1408,violently off that course. 
1409,JAMIE: Ah yes 
1410,"ZOE: Yes, but I allowed for that. Look! "
1411,DOCTOR: Oh. 
1412,JAMIE: Oh. 
1413,ZOE: Electromagnetic waves are always at right-angles to the direction
1414,"of propagation, and, as you know, travel at one hundred and eighty six"
1415,"thousand, two hundred and eighty two miles per second. "
1416,"DOCTOR: Do they really? How interesting. Well, what's the answer? "
1417,ZOE: Here! 
1418,DOCTOR: What? 
1419,"ZOE: If we'd stayed on our original course, the Tardis would have"
1420,"landed within ten miles of where we are now. Except, of course, it"
1421,would still be up there because we weren't travelling quite so fast. 
1422,"DOCTOR: Oh, bless my soul! Yes, of course. Yes, as you say, a simple"
1423,calculation. I should have thought of that myself. 
1424,"ZOE: Yes, I wonder why you didn't? "
1425,JAMIE: Did all that talk mean that the Tardis is going to land
1426,somewhere around here? 
1427,"DOCTOR: Jamie, it's all here, written down. It's as plain as a"
1428,pike-staff. 
1429,"JAMIE: Aye, well, in that case, the pirates are going to be round here"
1430,too! 
1431,"DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, you're right. "
1432,ZOE: Do you think Milo's one of them and that's why he landed here? 
1433,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think it's possible. "
1434,"JAMIE: Aye, he seemed to know all about them, didn't he? Look, I think"
1435,we ought to get out of here before he comes back. 
1436,"ZOE: Yes, so do I. We don't even know if he has gone to the generator"
1437,room. He might just have gone to get his gang. 
1438,JAMIE: Aye. 
1439,(The Doctor checks outside the cabin.) 
1440,"DOCTOR: All right. All right, but if the Tardis has landed here we'll"
1441,"have to find it anyway. Come on, you two, but for heaven's sake don't"
1442,make a noise on the ladder. 
1443,(Jamie falls over something.)

1474,CAVEN: That's right. That's exactly what I want you to do. 
1475,"DERVISH: Yeah, but the Space Corps have got a V-ship and a flight of"

1691,JAMIE: We were in the same trap ourselves. The pirates left us for
1692,dead. 
1693,SORBA: I thought you were decoys. 
1694,"ZOE: Oh look, we wouldn't be here now if we were helping them. "
1695,SORBA: Then how did you get off the beacon? 
1696,"DOCTOR: Well, well, it's a long story, but the important thing is to"
1697,escape from here now. 
1698,SORBA: Do you think I haven't tried? That shaft is the only way in.
1699,It's impossible to get out. 
1700,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. There's another entrance here somewhere. "
1701,SORBA: I've searched every inch of this cell. Solid rock. 
1702,"DOCTOR: There's a hidden door. The problem of course, is going to be"
1703,finding it. 
1704,"SORBA: There's no door, believe me. You're only wasting your time. "
1705,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. There's obviously a less painful way of getting"
1706,in here so there must be a way of getting out. 
1707,"ZOE: What makes you so sure? I mean, it could be a sort of tomb. "
1708,"JAMIE: Aye, a burial pit. "
1709,"DOCTOR: Look. Water, in a fragile bowl. Well that couldn't have been"
1710,"thrown down that chute, now could it?"

1714,"DERVISH : Caven, I've got the crews out"
1715,"realigning the auxiliary rockets for Lobos, but one of the beacon"
1716,sections is missing. 
1717,CAVEN: That's not possible. 
1718,"DERVISH : Look, there's only seven sections here. There"
1719,"should be eight. I checked back right along the flight path, but"
1720,there's not a sign of it. It's completely disappeared. 
1721,CAVEN: Nothing disappears in space. Even if the rocket exploded there'd
1722,be debris along the flight path. 
1723,"DERVISH : There's no debris, there's nothing. It's"
1724,completely disappeared. The scanner shows zero find. 
1725,CAVEN: But that's crazy. There must be some explanation. 
1726,"DERVISH : Oh yeah, there's an explanation all right, but"
1727,you're not going to like it. 
1728,"CAVEN: Well, come on, come on. "
1729,DERVISH : Somebody must have engineered the section out of
1730,its flight path. 
1731,CAVEN: How could anybody manage that? 
1732,"DERVISH : Well, I don't know. "
1733,CAVEN: Wait a minute. That space guard. The one we took off the beacon.
1734,
1735,DERVISH : Lieutenant Sorba? 
1736,CAVEN: Yes. He said something about seeing strangers on board. Perhaps
1737,"he wasn't raving. Perhaps we've got competition, Dervish. Someone"
1738,"trying to cut themselves in, hey? "
1739,"DERVISH : Just a minute. Look, I've got to go. Once of the spider"
1740,teams wants picking up. 
1741,CAVEN: Right. I'll question Sorba about these strangers he saw. Call in
1742,as soon as you get the sections on the new flight path.

1754,DOCTOR: It's got to be here. Look. 
1755,"JAMIE: Aye, I know. Cracks in the wall. "
1756,"DOCTOR: Yes, but see the way they run. "
1757,JAMIE: There are marks like that all over the place.

1760,"JAMIE: Oh, search me. "
1761,(The Doctor is listening to the wall through his stethoscope.) 
1762,DOCTOR: There's got to be a control unit here somewhere. Just a
1763,"question of locating it, that's all. "
1764,ZOE: What sort of control unit? 
1765,"DOCTOR: Shush, shush. Just a minute. "
1766,(The Doctor taps one piece of wall.) 
1767,"DOCTOR: Ah ha. Yes. Yes, it's under there. "
1768,JAMIE: What's under there? 
1769,DOCTOR: An audio lock. 
1770,ZOE: An audio lock! 
1771,"JAMIE: Oh now, wait a minute, what's an audio lock? "
1772,"DOCTOR: Well, they were used on safes, Jamie. Combination locks became"
1773,a little too easy to open when burglars took to taking miniature
1774,computers with them on their expeditions. Now I have my tuning forks
1775,here somewhere. 
1776,ZOE: What are you going to do with a tuning fork? 
1777,"DOCTOR: I usually carry them with. Ah, yes. Here we are, now then, get"
1778,these sorted out. Right.

1783,HERMACK: What contact? 
1784,"PENN: It could be the sections of Alpha Four, sir. There are seven"
1785,objects moving quite slowly. 
1786,"WARNE: If it's the beacon, sir, there should be eight sections. "
1787,"HERMACK: What's their course, Penn? "
1788,"WARNE: Approximately the same as ours, sir. The convergence is less"
1789,than half a degree. 
1790,HERMACK: Then the flight destination must be Lobos. Clancey's home
1791,"planet. We've got him, Ian. "
1792,"WARNE: We can't be sure it is the beacon, sir. Well, we counted eight"
1793,sections originally. 
1794,HERMACK: Just a minute. What's that on the edge of the scanner? 
1795,"PENN: I'm trying to get a fix on it now, sir. It's just come into"
1796,frame. 
1797,HERMACK: It must be the missing section. 
1798,"PENN: No, sir, it's too big and it's moving too fast. I think it's some"
1799,kind of ship. 
1800,"HERMACK: Out there? No, with any luck it's the pirates. "
1801,WARNE: She seems to be circling. 
1802,"HERMACK: Can't you magnify that signal, Penn? "
1803,"PENN: No, sir. She's right out on the fringe. "
1804,"HERMACK: Ian, get down to the Minnow deck. I want you ready to go as"
1805,soon as we've got an identification. 
1806,"WARNE: Right, sir. "
1807,HERMACK: Power room? I want main boost for as long as we can hold it.

1813,"WARNE : X X 2 ready to go. Any news yet, V-Master? "
1814,HERMACK: The range is down to forty minutes. Penn has just made a
1815,"positive identification. It is a Beta Dart, so they can still outrun"
1816,us. 
1817,"WARNE : She won't outrun a Minnow, sir. "
1818,"PENN: Sir, she's boosting. She must have spotted us. "

1857,WARNE : Right. I can see her on the visual scanners. 
1858,HERMACK: Switch video through here. We might as well all enjoy this. 
1859,"WARNE : Cutting you in now, sir. "
1860,(Hermack is aghast.) 
1861,HERMACK: That's an Issigri ship! Flash out! Flash out! 
1862,WARNE : Contact broken. 
1863,HERMACK: You didn't fire at her? 
1864,"WARNE : No, sir. I was just in range when I got the flash"
1865,out. What's gone wrong? 
1866,HERMACK: We nearly wiped out one of the Issigri Mining Company's new
1867,freighters. 
1868,WARNE : You mean to say that wasn't the pirate ship? Then
1869,where's it got to?

1878,"DOCTOR: You want to get out of here, don't you? "
1879,"JAMIE: Oh, that's not going to get us out. "
1880,"DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, it is! An audio lock is a simple solenoid switch"
1881,which is only activated by a particular sound. It's just a question of
1882,"finding it, that's all. "

1911,JAMIE: Hmm. 
1912,"MILO: If that don't beat jumping grasshoppers. You listen to me, you"
1913,three sourpusses. You're only in this pickle now because you did the
1914,very thing I told you not to do. You went wandering off into these mine
1915,"workings. I've had a whale of a time trying to find you, and if you"
1916,"want to get out of here alive, Milo Clancey is the only person who can"
1917,"show you the way. Now, you either come with me, or am I going to leave"
1918,you here to rot? 
1919,"DOCTOR: Well, well, well, yes, yes, if you put it that way. "
1920,MILO: Right. Good thinking. It's about time one of you showed a bit of
1921,sense. Who's this? 
1922,SORBA: My name is Sorba. Lieutenant Sorba.

1936,before he got ten yards. 
1937,"DOCTOR: What, you mean he got away? "
1938,MILO: Aye he did. It means we're in real trouble. There'll be guards
1939,swarming round that tunnel now like a buzz of bees!

1983,ZOE: But didn't you say that Madeleine Issigri was your sworn enemy? 
1984,"MILO: Yeah, well, I thought she was. I thought it was her lot that was"
1985,behind all this piracy trying to do me out of business. 
1986,DOCTOR: You've changed your mind. Why? 
1987,"MILO: Well, I thought Madeleine blamed me for her father's death. Poor"
1988,old Dom. He just disappeared. Years ago now. I wasn't even here at the
1989,time. And then all this piracy started and Madeleine started to find
1990,"argonite in workings that Dom and I had abandoned years ago. Well, it"
1991,all seemed to fit together somehow. 
1992,"ZOE: Yes, well, it fits together a bit too well, if you ask me. Aren't"
1993,we jumping out of the frying pan into the fire? 
1994,MILO: No! No! When I followed you down that shaft I recognised the
1995,leader of these pirates. He's a murderous criminal called Maurice

2101,MADELEINE: Wait! I never agreed to anything like
2102,this. 
2103,"CAVEN: If you don't like it, step outside for a moment. "
2104,MADELEINE: I don't want any more killing. 
2105,CAVEN: Too bad. 
2106,"MADELEINE: I warn you, Caven, don't overreach yourself. "
2107,CAVEN: I never do that. 
2108,"MADELEINE: Well then, just remember I'm still running this operation. "
2109,"CAVEN: Are you? I do all the dirty work. The space piracy, the capital"
2110,larceny 
2111,MILO: The first degree homicides! 
2112,"CAVEN: Right, Clancey. While all you do is sit there looking pretty and"
2113,count the money. But that doesn't mean to say you're not guilty. 
2114,"MADELEINE: Maybe, but I never agreed to murder. "
2115,"CAVEN: Well, you'd better agree to it, because if we don't get rid of"
2116,"these snoops, we'll both end up in a nirvan chamber. "
2117,MADELEINE: I don't want them killed! There must be some other solution.
2118,
2119,"DOCTOR: Yes, there's just got to be."
2120,CAVEN: Dyce. 
2121,"(Caven turns away, and the Doctor and Milo realise Jamie is going to"
2122,attack a guard. They grab him.) 
2123,DOCTOR: Jamie! 
2124,JAMIE: Let go of me! 
2125,ZOE: You don't stand a chance. 
2126,"(Jamie relaxes. Caven whispers to one of his men, who goes over to the"
2127,prisoners.) 
2128,"GUARD: Come on, hurry up. Out of the line. Move yourselves. "
2129,"DOCTOR: All right, there's no need to shout. "
2130,MADELEINE: What are you going to do with them? 
2131,"CAVEN: Don't worry, they're not going to be shot. "
2132,"MADELEINE: I don't trust you, Caven. "
2133,CAVEN: I told Fraze to lock them away under the dock complex. Ask him
2134,if you don't believe me. 
2135,(The Doctor and Co. are taken from the room.) 
2136,MADELEINE: What made you change your mind all of a sudden? 
2137,"CAVEN: I had a better idea, that's all. "
2138,MADELEINE: Oh yes? 
2139,CAVEN: That Space Corps ship is becoming a nuisance. I've thought of a
2140,way of getting rid of it.

2143,
2144,WARNE : I tracked the sections of the
2145,"beacon right into Lobos, sir. "
2146,HERMACK: Were they being collected? 
2147,"WARNE : No, sir. They were in orbit round the planet. I"
2148,made a landing at Clancey's base but it looked pretty derelict to me. 
2149,HERMACK: No sign of Clancey himself? 
2150,"WARNE : No, sir. I talked to some of the mining crew. They"
2151,said he took off several weeks ago. They haven't heard from him since. 
2152,HERMACK: Are you sure they're speaking the truth? 
2153,"WARNE : I'm sure they are, sir. I made a pretty close"
2154,"reconnaissance of the area, and there's no pad installation big enough"
2155,"to take a Beta Dart the size the pirates use, sir. "
2156,"HERMACK: If there is one, it's certain to be camouflaged. "
2157,"WARNE : Well, I checked for radiation traces, sir. No, I'd"
2158,say that that planet has not been used by a ship with atomic drive. 
2159,HERMACK: But the sections of Alpha Four are in collection orbit around
2160,Lobos? How do you explain that? 
2161,"WARNE : Well, it's possibly been done to side-track us,"
2162,"sir, to put us off the pirates' real base. "
2163,"HERMACK: All right, Ian. We'll move in and find them. Bring that Minnow"
2164,in. 
2165,"WARNE : I'm on my way home, sir. "
2166,HERMACK: Penn! 
2167,PENN: Sir? 
2168,HERMACK: I've called in X X 2. Give Major Warne a beacon signal to home
2169,on. 
2170,"PENN: Yes, sir. "
2171,"HERMACK: Penn, Major Warne thinks those beacon sections were diverted"
2172,to Lobos to mislead us. What was their course when our scanners first
2173,picked them up? 
2174,"PENN: I've got the plots on the computer, sir. That's their original"
2175,course. 
2176,HERMACK: Hm. Can you project a destination from that data? 
2177,"PENN: I'm just doing that sir. On that course, the beacon sections"
2178,would eventually have been drawn into an elliptical orbit around the
2179,planet of Ta. 
2180,"HERMACK: Ta! I see. Thank you, Penn."

2198,DOCTOR: What? 
2199,MILO: That picture. It's Dom Issigri! 
2200,ZOE: Madeleine's father? 
2201,"MILO: Yeah. Well, wait a moment now. This. Yeah. This is the old"

2203,
2204,"DOCTOR: You don't happen to remember where the light switch is, do you"
2205,Milo? 
2206,"MILO: You won't find a light switch, Doctor. You might find some"
2207,"candles, or something. "
2208,JAMIE: Candles? 
2209,MILO: Yeah. 
2210,JAMIE: In this day and age? 
2211,"MILO: Or an oil lamp or something. Hey boy, look in that cupboard, you"
2212,"might find something. Yeah, yeah. He was an old-fashioned romantic old"
2213,"critter, was old Dom. He brought all this furniture, he brought all"
2214,"them books and everything from Earth, you know. "
2215,ZOE: Are these candles? 
2216,"DOCTOR: Ah, well done, Zoe. Yes, a whole box of them. "
2217,"ZOE: Well, how do they work? "
2218,JAMIE: How do they work? 
2219,DOCTOR: You take them and I'll show you. 
2220,"JAMIE: Hey, we need a flint box. "
2221,"DOCTOR: All right, Jamie, I've got some matches. Now, you just light"
2222,"the wick, you see, Zoe, and the wax allows the wick to burn fairly"
2223,slowly. There we are. My word. Good lord! This is very interesting. 
2224,"(There is a gramophone player, an old radio set and a grandfather clock"
2225,ticking away to itself.) 
2226,"MILO: Hey, Doctor. You know there's one thing I can't quite understand."
2227,It is why Madeleine let Caven put us in here. 
2228,ZOE: Why? 
2229,"MILO: Well, like I said, this used to be the old fellow's private"
2230,"study, and she had it all locked up, so I was told, when he"
2231,disappeared. She swore that nobody would ever come in here again. 
2232,JAMIE: Nobody has. Look at the dust everywhere. Look. 
2233,DOCTOR: I think somebody's been in here quite recently. 
2234,JAMIE: Eh? 
2235,"MILO: Well, why do you say that, Doctor? "
2236,DOCTOR: This clock. 
2237,"JAMIE: Well, what about it? "
2238,"DOCTOR: It's an eight day movement, Jamie. "
2239,"MILO: Well, why would anyone come down here just to wind a clock? "
2240,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's what I'm wondering. "
2241,"ZOE: Oh! Oh, Doctor! "
2242,DOCTOR: What is it? 
2243,"ZOE: Doctor, look! "

2250,DERVISH : Beta Buccaneer to Control. We
2251,are now in landing orbit. Give me clearance to pad. 
2252,"CAVEN: Hello, Dervish. Bring the ship down on Pad three. Got that? "
2253,DERVISH : Pad three. Right. 
2254,(Transmission ends.) 
2255,"CAVEN: The nose cone worked, by the way. It put the Space Corps right"
2256,off the scent. 
2257,MADELEINE: Hermack's men'll be back though. I mean it's only a matter
2258,of time before he realises there's nothing on Lobos and the pirates
2259,must be based here. 
2260,CAVEN: Do you think I haven't anticipated that? 
2261,MADELEINE: Oughtn't we to put our emergency plan into operation? 
2262,"CAVEN: Flood the workings, lose all our equipment? "
2263,MADELEINE: We've got no alternative. Hermack's men will find our
2264,"argonite smelting plant, and we'll be ferried back to home planet to"
2265,face a capital charge. 
2266,"CAVEN: I think we do have an alternative, and if it works we'll be in a"
2267,"position to re-start operations. After a discreet interval, of course. "
2268,MADELEINE: What exactly did you have in mind? 
2269,CAVEN: Hermack thinks that Clancey is behind the space piracy. We found
2270,"his old ship, the"
2271,"Liz, in an abandoned freighter dock. I'm going to have it fitted with"
2272,an overriding remote control. Then we'll put Clancey and his friends
2273,"aboard, and boost them into orbit just when Hermack's V-ship comes into"
2274,scanner range. 
2275,HERMACK: So that they pick Clancey up? But that's crazy! He'll tell him
2276,"everything, he'll blow the "
2277,"CAVEN: Don't worry. The Space Corp won't get a word out of Clancey, or"
2278,those friends of his. 
2279,MADELEINE: No! I will not be party to murder. When all this started it
2280,"was going to be a salvage operation. Space flotsam, you said. But then"
2281,piracy and now murder? 
2282,CAVEN: You're taking a cut out of the profits. 
2283,"MADELEINE: Yes, but because it's too late. I'm involved. "
2284,CAVEN: You wanted to get rid of Clancey. I'm proposing to do it
2285,permanently. 
2286,"MADELEINE: By cold blooded, deliberate murder. No! I will not let you"
2287,do it! 
2288,CAVEN: I don't think you've got much choice. 
2289,MADELEINE: Are you threatening me? 
2290,CAVEN: You may be the head of the Issigri Mining Company and very
2291,"important back on Earth, but on this planet I have twice as many men as"
2292,you and mine are all armed. I don't have to make threats. I'm telling
2293,you not to interfere. 
2294,(Dervish enters.) 
2295,"CAVEN: Ah, Dervish, we're discussing a space accident. "
2296,"DERVISH: Oh, where? "
2297,CAVEN: I haven't quite decided where it'll take place yet. 
2298,"DERVISH: I'm sorry, I don't get it. "
2299,CAVEN: Don't worry. I want you to go down to the abandoned freighter
2300,"dock, Dervish. You'll find an old C class ship there on the pad. Take"
2301,some men with you and fit it out with a remote control guidance unit. 
2302,"DERVISH: What, now? But look, Caven, I've only just got back. "
2303,"CAVEN: This is important, Dervish. "
2304,"DERVISH: All right, if you say so. What's it for? "
2305,CAVEN: Don't ask questions. Get on with it. 
2306,DERVISH: Right. 
2307,"CAVEN: Oh, and by the way. "
2308,DERVISH: Yes? 
2309,"CAVEN: It's a very old ship, did I say that? Practically falling apart."

2921,(Milo has tilted too far back on his chair and fallen on the floor.) 
2922,"MILO: Ah! There you go. Maybe it'll be somewhere behind here, Dom."

2925,
2926,CAVEN: They're locked from the inside. 
2927,(Caven uses a comm link.) 
2928,CAVEN: Madeleine.
2929,
2930, [Issigri Mining office]
2931,
2932,CAVEN : Can you hear me? This is Caven.
2933,
2934,MADELEINE: He's probably outside the main door. That's where the
2935,"internal video is. You can't get in, Caven. By the time you cut through"
2936,"that door, the Space Corps will be swarming all over Ta."
2937,
2938,[Outside the Issigri Mining office]
2939,
2940,"CAVEN: Oh dear, Madeleine, you've disappointed me."
2941,"We could have made a fortune together, instead of which I have to leave"
2942,and you have to die.
2943,
2944,[Issigri Mining office]
2945,
2946,"MADELEINE: Empty threats, Caven. "
2947,[Outside the Issigri Mining office]
2948,
2949,"CAVEN: Oh no. Dervish, you'll need eighteen to"
2950,twenty demolition charges. 
2951,DERVISH: What for? 
2952,CAVEN: Connect them in series to the atomic fuel store. 
2953,"DERVISH: But that's madness, Caven. There isn't time. The Space Corps"
2954,will here before we're finished. 
2955,"CAVEN: We will finish, don't worry. "
2956,"DERVISH: Yeah, but "
2957,CAVEN: Do as I say! 
2958,(Dervish leaves.) 
2959,CAVEN: Should be quite a bang. The equivalent of about eighty
2960,old-fashioned hydrogen bombs. 
2961,[Issigri Mining office]
2962,
2963,MADELEINE: You'd never do that. You'd blow yourself
2964,sky-high as well! 
2965,[Outside the Issigri Mining office]
2966,
2967,CAVEN: Oh no. We shall explode it when we're a safe
2968,"distance away, and the V-Ship is right in the flash zone. You have"
2969,"about forty minutes. Oh, don't try to leave. I'm turning the manual"
2970,lock on this side. Enjoy the big bang!
2971,
2972, [Issigri Mining office]
2973,
2974,MADELEINE: That's it. I don't think he's bluffing.
2975,And if he sets off an explosion in the atomic fuel store 
2976,DOCTOR: Then we must see to it that he doesn't. 
2977,"JAMIE: Well, how? We can't stop him if we're locked in here. "
2978,ZOE: What about the Space Corps? Can they get here in time? 
2979,"MADELEINE: No, V-ships require a complicated landing technique. They're"
2980,so large. 
2981,"DOCTOR: Besides, we shall have to warn them of Caven's intended escape."
2982,
2983,JAMIE: Then who's going to get us out of here? 
2984,"DOCTOR: There's only one man who can, Jamie. Milo. "
2985,ZOE: But the Liz is still jammed on remote control. 
2986,"DOCTOR: I know, I know, but we shall free it. "
2987,JAMIE: You hope. 
2988,DOCTOR: Get on to the space patrol. Tell them what's happened. I'd
2989,better see how Milo's getting on with that bird's nest.

2993,(A long narrow corridor with lines of huge
2994,"cylinders in racks. In a radiation suit, Dervish attaches tiny"
2995,canisters to each cylinder. Caven watches through an inspection window.
2996,"After linking each canister to a main cable, Dervish leaves the store."
2997,A clock on the wall says 11:25.) 
2998,CAVEN: You're taking your time. 
2999,DERVISH: Only the detonator to connect up now. 
3000,CAVEN: Well get a move on! 
3001,DERVISH: Do you mind? 
3002,CAVEN: What? 
3003,DERVISH: This is something that can't be rushed. 
3004,(Dervish opens the box with the detonator in it. Caven grabs his
3005,shoulder.) 
3006,"DERVISH: Do that again, and we won't have half a second left. I've"
3007,known one of these things go up if somebody so much as coughed! 
3008,CAVEN: We've got half an hour before that V-ship drops on us. 
3009,"(Dervish hands the detonator to Caven, then puts on his protective gear"
3010,again and takes it back. He re-enters the store.)
3011,
3012, [V-Ship flight deck]
3013,
3014,MADELEINE [on viewscreen]: He's planting some sort
3015,"of explosive device in the atomic fuel store, with a radio control"
3016,detonator. 
3017,HERMACK: He intends to leave Ta in a Beta Dart and explode out of
3018,range. 
3019,MADELEINE [on viewscreen]: Yes. 
3020,HERMACK: Then we must try and intercept him before he has the chance to
3021,"transmit the triggering pulse. We'll let you know, Miss Issigri, don't"
3022,worry.
3023,
3024,[LIZ 79]
3025,
3026,(Milo is dealing with a mares nest of wires.) 
3027,DOCTOR : Milo? Have you found that little red wire leading into the
3028,neuristor bank? 
3029,"MILO: Huh! Little red wire, he says. There's about a thousand little"
3030,"red wires here. You hold that bunch, will you, Dom? Now, neuristor"
3031,"bank? Ah, well that might be this one here. I'll give that a go there. "
3032,(Electric shock. Milo yelps.) 
3033,DOCTOR : It sounds as if you've found it. 
3034,"MILO: Jumping galactic gob-stoppers, why didn't you tell me it was"
3035,alive! My fingers. 
3036,"DOCTOR : Now, somewhere near that neuristor bank, there should be"
3037,the implanted overriding unit. It's probably transistorised. Very
3038,small. 
3039,DOM: Is that it? 
3040,MILO: Yeah? 
3041,DOM: Is that it? 
3042,"MILO: Could be, Dom. We'll try that one, shall we? Right. Good. "
3043,(Milo yanks the little device out and the Liz veers to the side.) 
3044,DOCTOR : What's happening? 
3045,MILO: I found it! 
3046,"DOCTOR : Right. Now, dismantle it carefully. "
3047,"MILO: I just have. Hold on a second, Dom. We're on our way!"
3048,
3049,[Atomic fuel store area]
3050,
3051,(Dervish has connected the main cable to the
3052,detonator unit. He wires that to a radio control box and comes out of
3053,the fuel store proper.) 
3054,DERVISH: All fixed. 
3055,CAVEN: Good! By twelve hundred hours we'll be far enough away to escape
3056,the blast. 
3057,DERVISH: Is the ship ready? 
3058,"CAVEN: On the pad. Come on, let's go. "

3074,and me scuffling along in the old Liz. 
3075,"DOM: If I were a little less old, I "
3076,"MILO: Hold on, Dom. You'll be all right. Look, in a minute or two,"
3077,"we're going to land on Ta. You'll see little Maddie again, Dom. "
3078,DOM: Little Maddie? 
3079,MILO: Maddie. 
3080,"DOM: Yes, yes, Maddie. Maddie. "
3081,"MILO: Hold onto something, Dom. Hold on, I'm going to try and approach"

3087,"about thirty seconds, sir. "
3088,"HERMACK: Right! Don't fire until I give the word. No, wait a minute,"
3089,there's an audio contact. 
3090,"CAVEN : Beta Dart to V-forty one. Call that Minnow off our tail,"
3091,"Hermack. I'm warning you, if he comes any closer I'll pull this switch"
3092,and we'll all die together. 
3093,"HERMACK: You'd better pull back, Ian. "
3094,"WARNE : Okay, sir, if you say so. "
3095,HERMACK: Twelve minutes. Give me Issigri Headquarters. I'd better break
3096,the news to them.

3103,"MILO: Yeah, loud and clear. We'll be seeing you in a minute, Maddie"
3104,"girl, because we've landed. "
3105,"MADELEINE : Thank goodness for that. Now listen, Milo, there isn't"
3106,much time. You've got to get over to Headquarters and release us
3107,quickly. 
3108,MILO: But why? What's going on? 
3109,MADELEINE: There's no time for questions! Hurry! 
3110,"MILO: Righto! You'd better stay down there, old timer. I've got some"
3111,"running to do, and I don't think that you're really up to it. All"
3112,right?
3113,
3114, [V-Ship flight deck]
3115,
3116,MADELEINE : The Doctor thinks that he
3117,might be able to defuse this explosive. 
3118,"HERMACK: You haven't much more time. Eight, perhaps ten minutes. I've"
3119,got to launch that Beta Dart at twelve hundred. 
3120,"MADELEINE : All right, but give us as long as you can. "
3121,HERMACK: Good luck. You'll need it.

3126,"MILO: I haven't run so far since I was knee high to a grasshopper. Hey,"
3127,what going on here? Where are you all going?

3131, [V-Ship flight deck]
3132,
3133,"WARNE : I could creep the Minnow in,"

3143,"at it, then at the cable, then the radio control box and aerial. Then"

3146,"ZOE: Oh, Doctor, hurry! "
3147,"MILO: Land sakes alive, girl, he's got to find the right one. He'll"
3148,blow us all to bits if he moves the wrong wire. 
3149,(Madeleine looks at the clock. 11-55. The Doctor unscrews the
3150,inspection cover of the detonation unit. 11-56. The Doctor reaches
3151,inside the remote unit and removes a waxed cartridge with wires running
3152,from it to the radio control box.)

3174,destroyed the Beta Dart. 
3175,"MILO: Well, at least those varmints have done something right for a"
3176,"change, hey? "
3177,MADELEINE: General Hermack is coming back here to pick me up. I have to
3178,go back to home planet. 
3179,ZOE: What for? 
3180,MADELEINE: To stand trial. 
3181,"MILO: To stand trial? Now listen, don't you worry about that, little"
3182,Maddie girl. I'll have a few words with those fangdanglers about that. 
3183,MADELEINE: Don't worry. The General doesn't seem to think that the
3184,"outcome will be disastrous, and my father's evidence will help. "
3185,"MILO: Yeah, damn tooting it will. Poor old critter. Hey, would you like"
3186,"to go and have a have a word with him, Maddie girl? He's only out there"
3187,on the Liz. 
3188,"MADELEINE: Yes, yes. It'll be strange seeing him after all these years."

3193,"ZOE: Doctor? Doctor, what about the Tardis? "
3194,"JAMIE: Hey, that's a point. Where is it? "
3195,"DOCTOR: Oh, the Tardis. Well, that's no problem. It's orbiting Lobos,"
3196,"Milo's home planet, in one of the beacon sections. "
3197,"ZOE: Oh no problem, hey? Well, how are we going to get to it? "
3198,DOCTOR: Milo's very kindly offered us a lift in the Liz.
