20,
21,DOCTOR: Apalapucia. 
22,AMY: Say it again? 
23,DOCTOR: Apalapucia. 
24,AMY Apalapu 
25,DOCTOR: Chia. 
26,RORY: Apalapucia. 
27,DOCTOR: Apalapucia. 
28,AMY: Apalapucia. What a beautiful word. 
29,"DOCTOR: Beautiful word, beautiful world. Apalapucia, voted number two"
30,planet in the top ten greatest destinations for the discerning
31,intergalactic traveller. 
32,RORY: Why couldn't we go to number one? 
33,DOCTOR: It's hideous. Everyone goes to number one. Planet of the coffee
34,"shops. Apalapucia. I give you sunsets, spires, soaring silver"
35,colonnades. I give you 
36,(The Doctor opens the Tardis door to reveal - a white space with a
37,door.) 
38,RORY: Doors. 
39,[White space]
40,
41,DOCTOR: Doors. Yes. I give you doors. But on the
42,"other side of those doors, I give you sunsets, spires, soaring silver"
43,colonnades. 
44,AMY: Have you seen my phone? 
45,DOCTOR: Your phone? 
46,AMY: Yeah. 
47,"DOCTOR: Your mobile telephone? I bring you to a paradise planet, two"
48,"billion light years from Earth, and you want to update Twitter. "
49,"AMY: Sunsets, spires, soaring silver colonnades. It's a camera phone. "
50,"DOCTOR: On the counter, by the DVDs. "
51,AMY: Thank you. 
52,RORY: How do we get in? 
53,DOCTOR: I don't know. Push a button. 
54,(There is a choice of two - Green Anchor and Red Waterfall. Rory
55,presses the Green.)
56,
57,[Green Anchor room]
58,
59,"(Still stark white decor, with a glass table and"
60,three avante guarde chairs.) 
61,"DOCTOR: Okay, so rain check on the soaring silver colonnades. "
62,RORY: Yeah. It's a magnifying glass. 
63,(And it is in the middle of the table. 
64,(Amy comes out of the Tardis with her phone.) 
65,"AMY : Hey? Hey, it's locked. "
66,"RORY: Yeah, push the button. "
67,"(Of course, she presses the Red Waterfall button.)"
68,
69,[Red Waterfall room]
70,
71,(Identical to Green Anchor except there are no
72,people here.) 
73,AMY: Rory?
74,
75,[Green Anchor room]
76,
77,"RORY: Come on, Amy."
78,
79,[Red Waterfall room]
80,
81,(The door shuts.) 
82,AMY: Great.
83,
84,[Green Anchor room]
85,
86,(Rory opens the door.) 
87,RORY: Where is she? Where on wherever we are is my wife? 
88,(The Doctor presses the green button on the magnifying glass. Amy looks
89,into the glass in her room and the Doctor sees her.) 
90,"DOCTOR: Rory, I think I've found her. "
91,"RORY: What do you mean you've found her? Whoa. No, but, she's not,"
92,she's not here.
93,
94,[Red Waterfall room]
95,
96,"RORY [in glass]: I can see her, but she's not here."
97,
98,[Green Anchor room]
99,
100,"AMY [in glass]: Where am I? In fact, where are you?"
101,
102,"(A white robot enters. It has a blank face, one red and one green"
103,"button on its torso, and is holding up a hand.) "
104,RORY: Whoa. 
105,"DOCTOR: Hands. Hello, hands. Robot with hands, Rory. "
106,HANDBOT: Welcome to the Twostreams facility. Will you be visiting long?
107,
108,"AMY [in glass]: Er, Doctor, something's happening. "
109,(The image in the glass starts to wiggle.) 
110,"DOCTOR: Er, Amy? Stay calm. Stay still. Ah, time's gone wobbly. I hate"
111,it when it does that. 
112,HANDBOT: Will you be visiting long? 
113,RORY: Good question. Bit sinister. What's the answer to not get us
114,killed? 
115,"DOCTOR: It's okay, I've got you, you're fine. "
116,[Red Waterfall room]
117,
118,ROBOT : Will you be visiting long? 
119,"RORY [in glass]: Doctor? A little help, Doctor. "
120,AMY: And where have you been?
121,
122,[Green Anchor room]
123,
124,RORY: What do I tell it? 
125,AMY [in glass]: I've been here a week. 
126,[Red Waterfall room]
127,
128,DOCTOR [in glass]: A week? 
129,[Green Anchor room]
130,
131,"DOCTOR: A week? I'm so sorry. Ah-ha. Same room,"
132,different times. Two different timestreams running parallel but at
133,"different speeds. Amy, you're in a faster timestream."
134,
135,[Red Waterfall room]
136,
137,"AMY: Doctor, it's going again."
138,
139,[Green Anchor room]
140,
141,RORY: Doctor! 
142,DOCTOR: Amy! 
143,AMY [in glass]: Doctor!
144,
145,[Red Waterfall room]
146,
147,DOCTOR [in glass]: Come on. Gotcha. There.
148,"Stabilised, settled, shush."
149,
150,[Green Anchor room]
151,
152,RORY: Why has this got hands? 
153,"DOCTOR: Organic skin. Ultimate universal interface, grown and grafted,"
154,"not born. I mean, it's actually seeing with its fingers, scanning the"
155,room. But why not just give it eyes? 
156,HANDBOT: Will you be visiting long? 
157,DOCTOR: As long as it takes.
158,
159,[Red Waterfall room]
160,
161,"DOCTOR [in glass]: Amy, what exactly did you do? "
162,"AMY: I just, I came in "
163,[Green Anchor room]
164,
165,AMY [in glass]: And I pressed the door button. 
166,RORY: Oh. 
167,[Red Waterfall room]
168,
169,"RORY [in glass]: Amy, there are two buttons. The"
170,green anchor and the red waterfall.
171,
172,[Green Anchor room]
173,
174,RORY: Which one did you push? 
175,AMY [in glass]: I pushed the red waterfall. 
176,RORY: Great. 
177,[White space]
178,
179,"(Rory goes outside, lets the door close and presses"
180,Red Waterfall. The door opens on an empty room.) 
181,RORY: Amy? 
182,"(He steps back, the door closes and he presses Green Anchor.)"
183,
184,[Green Anchor room]
185,
186,"RORY: I pressed Red Waterfall, and she wasn't"
187,there. 
188,"DOCTOR: Okay, so you can't follow her directly. You know, it's never"
189,"simple. Did you hear that, Handbot? She pressed the wrong button,"
190,"that's all. We're aliens, we didn't know. "
191,HANDBOT: Statement rejected. Apalapucia is under planet-wide
192,quarantine. This is a kindness facility for those infected with
193,Chen Seven. 
194,(The Doctor covers his mouth and nose with his coat lapel.) 
195,DOCTOR: What? 
196,"RORY: Chen Seven, hmm? "
197,DOCTOR: The one day plague. 
198,"RORY: What, you get it for a day? "
199,"DOCTOR: No, you get it, and you die in a day. "
200,HANDBOT: There are forty thousand residents in the Twostreams Facility.
201,Please remain in the sterile areas. Visiting hours are now. 
202,(The Handbot beams itself away.) 
203,DOCTOR: Sterile area. I'm safe. 
204,[Red Waterfall room]
205,
206,AMY: What about me?
207,
208,[Green Anchor room]
209,
210,DOCTOR: Chen Seven only affects two-hearted races
211,like Apalapucians.
212,
213,[Red Waterfall room]
214,
215,RORY [in glass]: And Time Lords. 
216,"DOCTOR [in glass]: Yeah, like me. Walk into that facility, I'm dead in"
217,a day. 
218,[Green Anchor room]
219,
220,DOCTOR: Time moves faster on Amy's side of the
221,glass.
222,
223,[Red Waterfall room]
224,
225,"DOCTOR [in glass]: Amy, you said you'd been here a"
226,week. What did you eat?
227,
228,[Green Anchor room]
229,
230,AMY [in glass]: Nothing. I wasn't hungry. 
231,[Red Waterfall room]
232,
233,"DOCTOR [in glass]: No, because that Red Waterfall"
234,time is compressed. That's the point. The Time Glass syncs up the 
235,[Green Anchor room]
236,
237,DOCTOR: Two timestreams for visits. You could be in
238,"here for a day, and watch them live out their entire lives. "
239,RORY: And watch them grow old in front of your eyes? 
240,[Red Waterfall room]
241,
242,RORY [in glass]: That's horrible.
243,
244,[Green Anchor room]
245,
246,"DOCTOR: No, Rory, it's kind. You've got a choice."
247,Sit by their 
248,[Red Waterfall room]
249,
250,DOCTOR [in glass]: Bedside for twenty four hours
251,"and watch them die, or sit in here for twenty four hours and watch them"
252,live. Which would you choose? 
253,(The Doctor pulls the Time Glass out of the table. Amy's one vanishes.)
254,
255,"AMY: Doctor? Doctor, no, don't leave me."
256,
257,[Green Anchor room]
258,
259,"DOCTOR: I'm here, Amy. I'm right here. "
260,AMY [in glass]: Where are you? Am I looking at you? 
261,DOCTOR: Turn left just a fraction. Bit more. Stop. That's it. 
262,AMY [in glass]: Eye to eye? 
263,DOCTOR: Eye to eye to eye. 
264,RORY: Hello. 
265,"DOCTOR: Amy, I'm taking the Time Glass back to the Tardis. Like satnav,"
266,"I'll use it to get a lock, then smash through using the Tardis to get"
267,"you out. Until then, you're on your own. "
268,(The Doctor sonicks the glass.) 
269,"RORY: Er, what are you doing? "
270,DOCTOR: Locking it on to Amy. Small act of vandalism. No one'll mind. 
271,(An alarm sounds.) 
272,"DOCTOR: Ah, that'll be the small act of vandalism alarm. Amy, I need"
273,you to go into the facility just for a bit. Find somewhere safe and
274,"leave me a sign. Remember, you're immune to Chen Seven, but don't let"
275,them give you anything. They don't know you're alien. Their kindness
276,will kill you. Now go. 
277,(Amy presses a button labelled Check In.) 
278,"AMY [in glass]: Rory, I love you. Now save me. Go on. "
279,"(Through the check-in door, she is sprayed with a gas.)"
280,
281,[Tardis]
282,
283,DOCTOR: This is locked onto Amy permanently. Play
284,"the signal into the console, the Tardis'll follow it. Now then, I know"
285,you're in here. 
286,(The Doctor rummages through a tool box.) 
287,"DOCTOR: Er, er, ha ha! How do I look? "
288,(The Doctor has found a pair of thick rimmed glasses.) 
289,RORY: Ridiculous. 
290,"DOCTOR: Glasses are cool, see? "
291,(He puts them on Rory.) 
292,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Hello, handsome man. "
293,"RORY: Oh, hello. "
294,"DOCTOR: Hello, Rory-cam. "
295,RORY: Huh? 
296,(The image of the Doctor is on the Time Glass.) 
297,"RORY: Oh, you can see what I see. "
298,"DOCTOR: We're breaking into Twostreams. Now, I can't go in there. The"
299,"Chen Seven'll kill me, no regeneration. You will be my eyes and ears. "
300,RORY: Rory-cam. Rescue Amy. Got it. 
301,"DOCTOR: That's the spirit. Now, smashing through a timewall could get a"
302,bit hairy. 
303,RORY: Is it safe? 
304,DOCTOR: Don't know. Never tried. Best hold onto something.
305,
306,[Check in area]
307,
308,"(Massive, white and deserted.) "
309,AMY: What the? 
310,(She is grabbed by a beam of light from a panel in the ceiling. It has
311,a pleasant female voice.) 
312,INTERFACE: Welcome to the Twostreams Facility. 
313,"AMY: Er, who are you and why can't I see you? "
314,INTERFACE: I am the Interface between yourself and the systems of the
315,"Twostreams Facility. I will be your guide, your teacher, your friend. "
316,(An image of a woman appears at a check in desk.) 
317,"CHECK IN GIRL: Welcome to Twostreams. What is your name, please? "
318,AMY: Amy. Amy Pond. 
319,"CHECK IN GIRL: Welcome, Amy Pond. I see you're travelling alone. As a"
320,"resident, you will now have access to all of the entertainment zones"
321,"inside. For a taste of adventure, why not try the mountain zone, and"
322,explore Apalapucia's famous Glasmir Mountains. Or try our
323,"roller-coaster zone, authentically modelled on the famous Warpspeed"
324,"Death Ride at Disneyland, Clom. All that you could wish for and more is"
325,"through the Departure Gate, provided for you with kindness. "
326,[Arrivals area]
327,
328,INTERFACE: Unexpected visitor. Welcome. Please seek
329,assistance. 
330,(A Handbot is up ahead.) 
331,"AMY: Hello? Hey. Oi, wait. "
332,(The Handbot turns and scans her.) 
333,HANDBOT: You are carrying unregistered bacteria. Please let me help
334,you. 
335,"AMY: No, I'm not from this world. Your medicine'll kill me. "
336,HANDBOT: Statement rejected. Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness. 
337,(Amy ducks and hides.) 
338,"AMY: No, no, please, I hate needles. "
339,HANDBOT: Secondary delivery system engaged. 
340,(It's head opens to reveal a needle gun. It misses its target and more
341,Handbots beam in.) 
342,"HANDBOT: Unauthorised infection on check-in, version two two three. "
343,(Amy jumps over a counter and gets into the service area.) 
344,[Service corridor]
345,
346,INTERFACE: Unauthorised resident detected. 
347,(Amy hides from a Handbot.) 
348,AMY: Come on. 
349,HANDBOT: This is a kindness. Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness. 
350,(And the chase is on.) 
351,INTERFACE: Unauthorised resident detected. Unauthorised resident
352,detected. 
353,"AMY: No. No, no. "
354,HANDBOT: This is a kindness. Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.
355,This is a kindness. Do not be alarmed. 
356,(Amy pulls at a mesh screen around a vent.) 
357,"AMY: Come on, please. "
358,(She gets inside.) 
359,HANDBOT: No residents detected. No residents detected. 
360,AMY: They didn't see me. They didn't see me.
361,
362,[Tardis]
363,
364,RORY: Red Waterfall. We made it. 
365,DOCTOR: Good old us.
366,
367,[Red Waterfall corridor]
368,
369,RORY; How do we know that we're in the same Red
370,Waterfall as Amy?
371,
372,[Tardis]
373,
374,DOCTOR: Focus on the positive. 
375,[Red Waterfall corridor]
376,
377,(Rory looks at a topless Greek-style statue of a
378,lady.) 
379,DOCTOR : We locked onto Amy's timestream. 
380,[Tardis]
381,
382,"DOCTOR: Eyes front, soldier."
383,
384,[Red Waterfall corridor]
385,
386,"RORY: Right, yes. Sorry."
387,
388,[Tardis]
389,
390,DOCTOR: Apalapucians are the great cultural
391,"scavengers, Rory. This gallery's a scrapbook of their favourite places."
392,
393,[Red Waterfall corridor]
394,
395,(Mona Lisa on a pedestal.) 
396,"RORY: Bit of Earth, bit of alien, bit of whatever the hell that is."
397,
398,[Gate Room]
399,
400,(With several free standing portals and a central
401,control column.) 
402,AMY: Interface? 
403,"INTERFACE: I am here, Amy Pond. "
404,"AMY: Shush, shush. Turn that light off. So I'm, what is this? How does"
405,it work? 
406,INTERFACE: This is the Gate. From here you may depart to any of
407,Twostreams' entertainment zones. 
408,(Amy presses buttons on the central column.) 
409,INTERFACE: Cinema. Aquarium. Garden. 
410,AMY: Garden? Why not? 
411,INTERFACE: Garden. 
412,"(The Iconian Portal flickers with light, then Amy runs through.)"
413,
414,[Garden]
415,
416,(Amy runs onto a terrace.) 
417,"AMY: That is beautiful. I mean, freaky hedges. "
418,INTERFACE: The perfect replica of a Shill Governor's Mansion on
419,Shallanna. 
420,AMY: You really could spend a lifetime in here. Not that I'm going to.
421,Interface? 
422,INTERFACE: Amy Pond? 
423,"AMY: Listen, I need somewhere safe to hide and wait for my friends."
424,Where in Twostreams is safe? 
425,"INTERFACE: Twostreams is a safe, nurturing environment. "
426,AMY: You know what I mean. Where can I go so the Handbots can't find
427,"me? Okay. Before, I was stood by a sort of vent, and there was light"
428,"and smoke, and the Handbots couldn't see me. Why not? Okay, I will put"
429,it another way. What were those vent thingies? 
430,INTERFACE: The vents channel the exhaust fumes from the Temporal
431,Engines that hold the multiple timestreams in place. 
432,"AMY: And these Temporal Engines mess up the Handbots' sensors. So,"
433,where's the Temporal Engines? 
434,INTERFACE: Temporal Engines held within. 
435,"(Interface shows Amy an image of the entrance to the Temporal Engines,"
436,by the Arrivals lounge.) 
437,AMY: Okay. 
438,(Two Handbots beam in.) 
439,HANDBOT: Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness. 
440,(Amy grabs their sensing hands and pushes them together. They short
441,out.) 
442,"AMY: Ha! Don't like that, do you? "
443,(She finds the door and goes inside.) 
444,[Temporal Engine room]
445,
446,AMY: Temporal engines. Somewhere to hide. 
447,(She goes back to the door and writes on it with her lipstick - Doctor
448,I'm waiting - and puts an arrow to the door handle.)
449,
450,[Tardis]
451,
452,RORY : Where is everyone? 
453,"DOCTOR: Right, Rory, switch the Time Glass on and sonic it. "
454,[Red Waterfall corridor]
455,
456,DOCTOR : I'm sending a command signal to the
457,"screwdriver. Amy's here somewhere, if I can just get a lock on her."
458,
459,[Tardis]
460,
461,DOCTOR: I wonder what happens if we mix the
462,filters? 
463,"(Lots of blurry people appear in the Time Glass, and via Rory-cam on a"
464,screen in the Tardis.) 
465,"DOCTOR: Oh, there they are. Forty thousand time streams overlapping."
466,"Red Waterfall isn't one time stream, it's thousands."
467,
468,[Red Waterfall corridor]
469,
470,RORY: Are they happy? 
471,"DOCTOR: Oh, Rory. "
472,[Tardis]
473,
474,DOCTOR: Trust you to think of that. 
475,[Red Waterfall corridor]
476,
477,DOCTOR : I think they're happy to be alive.
478,Better than the alternative. 
479,(Rory lowers the Time Glass and is confronted by a red haired female
480,Samurai warrior. He falls backwards.) 
481,"RORY: I come in peace. Peace, peace, peace, peace. "
482,WARRIOR: I waited. 
483,"RORY: Sorry, what? "
484,WARRIOR: I waited for you. I waited for you. 
485,(The warrior raises her helmet. She is an older Amy.) 
486,RORY: Amy. 
487,[Tardis]
488,
489,"RORY : Doctor, what's going on? "
490,DOCTOR: Er 
491,[Red Waterfall corridor]
492,
493,RORY: Amy. 
494,DOCTOR : I think the timestream lock might be a bit wobbly. 
495,(Amy raises her sword.) 
496,"RORY: No, please. Please. "
497,AMY: Duck. 
498,(Amy's katana goes straight through a Handbot's head.) 
499,AMY: Handbots carry a black box in case they go offline. I've changed
500,the cause of termination from hostile to accidental.
501,
502,[Tardis]
503,
504,AMY [on screen]: Easy to re-programme. Used my
505,sonic probe.
506,
507,[Red Waterfall corridor]
508,
509,RORY: Amy. 
510,AMY: Rory. 
511,RORY: Why? 
512,AMY: Because I've survived this long by making the Handbots think I
513,don't exist. 
514,[Tardis]
515,
516,AMY [on screen]: Don't touch the hands. 
517,[Red Waterfall corridor]
518,
519,AMY: There's anaesthetic transfer on the skin. If
520,"they touch you, you go to sleep. "
521,RORY: But you're still here? 
522,AMY: You didn't save me. 
523,"RORY: But, this is the saving. This is the us saving you. The Doctor"
524,just got the timing a bit out. 
525,DOCTOR [silent]: Sorry. 
526,"AMY: I've been on my own here a long, long time. I've had decades to"
527,think nice thoughts about him. Got a bit harder to stay charitable once
528,I entered decade four. 
529,RORY: Forty years? Alone? 
530,"AMY: Thirty six years, thanks. "
531,"RORY: No. Right. I mean, you look great. Really, really. "
532,"AMY: Eyes front, soldier. "
533,RORY: Still can't win then. 
534,"AMY: In fact, I think I can now definitely say I hate him. I hate The"
535,Doctor. I hate him more than I've ever hated anyone 
536,[Tardis]
537,
538,"AMY [on screen]: In my life, and you can hear every"
539,"word of this through those ridiculous glasses, can't you, Raggedy Man? "
540,"DOCTOR: Er, yes. Putting the speaker phone on. "
541,"AMY [on scanner]: You told me to wait, and I did. A lifetime. "
542,DOCTOR: Amy 
543,AMY [on scanner]: You've got nothing to say to me. 
544,"DOCTOR: Amy, behind you."
545,
546,[Red Waterfall corridor]
547,
548,(Two more Handbots. Amy throws her katana to Rory
549,and touches the Handbots hands
550,together.) 
551,AMY: Feedback. Knocks them out. 
552,[Tardis]
553,
554,AMY [on scanner]: Learned that trick on my first
555,day.
556,
557,[Arrivals area]
558,
559,"RORY: Okay, so we just take the Tardis back to the"
560,"right time stream, yeah? "
561,[Tardis]
562,
563,RORY : We can stop any of this happening.
564,
565,[Arrivals area]
566,
567,"DOCTOR : We locked on to a timestream, Rory."
568,This is it. 
569,RORY: This is so wrong. 
570,"AMY: I got old, Rory. What did you think was going to happen? "
571,"RORY: Hey, I don't care that you got old. I care that we didn't grow"
572,"old together. Amy, come on, please. "
573,AMY: Don't touch me. Don't do that. 
574,RORY: It's like you're not even her. 
575,"AMY: Thirty six years, three months, four days of solitary confinement."
576,This facility was built to give people the chance to live. 
577,[Tardis]
578,
579,AMY [on scanner]: I walked in here and I died. Do
580,"you have anything to say? Anything, Doctor? "
581,DOCTOR: Where did you get a sonic screwdriver? 
582,AMY [on scanner]: I made it. And it's a sonic probe.
583,
584,[Arrivals area]
585,
586,(The lipstick has all but disappeared from the door
587,now.) 
588,RORY: You made a sonic screwdriver? 
589,AMY: Probe.
590,
591,[Amy's lair]
592,
593,(Rory follows Amy into the place she has made her
594,home. There is a Handbot with a smiling face drawn on its head and
595,hooks instead of hands.) 
596,RORY: Oh. 
597,"AMY: Don't worry about him. Sit down, Rory. "
598,"(The Handbot sits, as does Rory.) "
599,RORY: You named him after me? 
600,AMY: Needed a bit of company. 
601,RORY: So he's like your pet? Is it safe? 
602,(Amy gets the remains of her lipstick from a box and looks at it.) 
603,AMY: Yep. I disarmed it. 
604,"RORY: How? Oh, you disarmed it. "
605,"AMY: Oh, don't get sentimental, it's just a robot. You'd have done the"
606,same.
607,
608,[Tardis]
609,
610,DOCTOR: I don't know that I would have. 
611,"AMY [on scanner]: And there he is. The voice of God. Survive, because"
612,no one's going to come for you. Number one lesson. 
613,[Amy's lair]
614,
615,AMY: You taught me that. 
616,DOCTOR : Is that really all I taught you?
617,
618,[Tardis]
619,
620,"AMY [on scanner]: Don't you lecture me, blue-box"
621,"man flying through time and space on whimsy. All I've got, all I've had"
622,"for thirty six years, is cold, hard reality. "
623,[Amy's lair]
624,
625,"AMY: So no, I don't have a sonic screwdriver"
626,because I'm not off on a romp. I call it what it is. A probe. And I
627,call my life what it is. Hell.
628,
629,[Tardis]
630,
631,"DOCTOR: Amy Pond, I am going to put this right. You"
632,said you learned from an 
633,[Amy's lair]
634,
635,DOCTOR : Interface. Can I speak with it? 
636,AMY: Doesn't work in here. Two twenty three. The garden'll be clear
637,now. Stay or go? 
638,"RORY: Sorry, me? No, I'm coming with you. "
639,AMY: Then try not to get killed. Or do. Whatever.
640,
641,[Garden]
642,
643,"AMY: When I first came here, I had to trick the"
644,"Interface into giving me the information, but I've reprogrammed it now."
645,It'll tell me anything except how to escape. 
646,RORY: You hacked it? That's genius. 
647,"DOCTOR: Sorry to interrupt that beautiful moment, but temporal engines "
648,[Tardis]
649,
650,DOCTOR: Like that have a regulator valve. Has to be
651,kept at a distance from the main reactor or there'd be feedback.
652,"Interface, where's the regulator? "
653,INTERFACE: The regulator valve is held within. 
654,(Showing a diagram of the location.) 
655,"DOCTOR: Oh. Very, very ah."
656,
657,[Garden]
658,
659,"DOCTOR : Interface, I need to run through some"
660,technical specifications. 
661,[Tardis]
662,
663,"DOCTOR: Rory, give me to Amy a minute."
664,
665,[Garden]
666,
667,RORY: Here you go. 
668,(He hands over the glasses and she slowly puts them on.) 
669,AMY: They look ridiculous. 
670,"RORY: That's what I told him. Still, anything beats a fez, eh? "
671,(They laugh briefly together.) 
672,RORY: What is it? 
673,AMY: I think that's the first time I've laughed in thirty six years. 
674,"RORY: I'll just, er, leave you two geniuses alone. I'll be back in a"
675,minute. 
676,"DOCTOR : There's still time, Amy. There's still time to fix"
677,everything. 
678,(Rory goes walking along the terrace until he comes to the portal.) 
679,RORY: How can you have a door without a wall? 
680,(A Handbot is approaching as he walks into the invisible wall by the
681,portal.) 
682,"RORY: Oh. Holographic wallpaper? Oh, sorry. Argh. "
683,(The Handbot touches his neck and he falls backwards.) 
684,HANDBOT: Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness. 
685,(It is about to fire its needle gun at Rory when Amy chops its head
686,off.) 
687,RORY: Oh. 
688,AMY: Rory? 
689,RORY: Glasses. 
690,AMY: You stupid 
691,RORY: Oh. You saved me. 
692,AMY: Don't get used to it. 
693,RORY: Have you been crying? A little bit. 
694,"AMY: Shut up, Rory. "
695,"RORY: You have, haven't you? "
696,AMY: Woman with a sword. Don't push it.
697,
698,[Tardis]
699,
700,"DOCTOR: Okay. So, here's the plan. "
701,[Garden]
702,
703,"DOCTOR : Time is always a bit wibbly-wobbly,"
704,but in Twostreams it's extra
705,wobbly. 
706,(Amy puts the glasses back on Rory.)
707,
708,[Tardis]
709,
710,DOCTOR: I've worked out how to hijack the Temporal
711,Engines and use them to fold two points of Amy's timeline together.
712,"We're bringing her out of the then and into the now. Amy, I just need"
713,"to borrow your brain a minute. It won't hurt, probably. Almost probably"
714,and then 
715,[Garden]
716,
717,"DOCTOR : Amy Pond, I'm going to save you."
718,
719,[Tardis]
720,
721,AMY [on screen]: No.
722,
723,[Garden]
724,
725,AMY: Time's up. Handbots coming. 
726,[Arrivals area]
727,
728,"DOCTOR : Amy, you've got to help us help you. I"
729,need you to think back 
730,[Tardis]
731,
732,DOCTOR: Thirty six years ago. Amy? Amy! 
733,[Arrivals area]
734,
735,(Amy goes back to the Temporal Engines entrance and
736,shuts the door in Rory's face. Rory uses the Time Glass to read the
737,faded message.) 
738,RORY: You told her to leave us a sign. 
739,[Tardis]
740,
741,RORY : And she did. And she waited.
742,
743,[Temporal Engine room]
744,
745,"RORY: Oh Amy, why won't you help yourself? "
746,"AMY: He wants to rescue past me from thirty six years back, which means"
747,I'll cease to exist. Everything I've seen and done dissolves. Time is
748,rewritten. 
749,"RORY: That's, that's good, isn't it? "
750,AMY: I will die. Another Amy will take my place. An Amy who never got
751,"trapped at Twostreams, an Amy who grew old with you, and she, in thirty"
752,"six years, won't be me. "
753,RORY: But you'll die in here! 
754,AMY: Not if you take me with you. 
755,[Tardis]
756,
757,"AMY [on screen]: You came to rescue me, so rescue"
758,me.
759,
760,[Temporal Engine room]
761,
762,RORY: Leave her and take you?
763,
764,[Tardis]
765,
766,"DOCTOR: We could take this Amy with us, easy, but"
767,"if we do, our Amy has to wait thirty six years to be rescued."
768,
769,[Temporal Engine room]
770,
771,RORY: So I have to choose. Which wife do I want? 
772,AMY: She is me. We're both me. 
773,"RORY: You being here is wrong. For a single day, an hour, let alone a"
774,lifetime. I swore to protect you. I promised.
775,
776,[Tardis]
777,
778,DOCTOR: Rory 
779,[Temporal Engine room]
780,
781,RORY: This is your fault.
782,
783,[Tardis]
784,
785,"DOCTOR: I'm so sorry, but, Rory "
786,[Temporal Engine room]
787,
788,"RORY: No, this is your fault! You should look in a"
789,"history book once in a while, see if there's an outbreak of "
790,[Tardis]
791,
792,RORY : Plague or not. 
793,DOCTOR: That is not how I travel. 
794,[Temporal Engine room]
795,
796,RORY: Then I do not want to travel with you! 
797,"(Rory takes off the glasses and throws them away. In the Tardis, the"
798,Doctor can hear younger Amy crying.) 
799,"DOCTOR : Rory, is the Time Glass still on? If the link's still"
800,"active, I think I can hear Amy. Our Amy. "
801,(It is. Rory looks through it to see her standing nearby.) 
802,"RORY: Oh, Amy."
803,
804,[Amy's lair]
805,
806,RORY: Look me in the face and say you won't help
807,her. 
808,AMY: I will not help her. 
809,"RORY: Okay, okay. Look me in the face and say it now. "
810,(He holds up the Time Glass so that Amy can see her weeping younger
811,self.) 
812,AMY [in glass]: Rory? Rory is that you? 
813,(Rory sonicks the Time Glass so that it appears in the past.) 
814,[Past Temporal Engine room]
815,
816,"AMY: Rory, where are you? "
817,"RORY : Same place as you, and a bit ahead. "
818,[Amy's lair]
819,
820,OLDER AMY: I remember this. 
821,AMY [in glass]: But who's she? There's no one else here but. Me? 
822,(Rory the Handbot holds the glasses out to Rory with his hook.)
823,
824,[Past Temporal Engine room]
825,
826,AMY: Why are we still here?
827,
828,[Amy's lair]
829,
830,OLDER AMY: Because they leave you. Because they get
831,in their Tardis and they fly away.
832,
833,[Past Temporal Engine room]
834,
835,"AMY: No. Rory wouldn't, not ever. Something must"
836,have stopped him.
837,
838,[Amy's lair]
839,
840,"OLDER AMY: You did. Or rather, the old version of"
841,you. 
842,[Past Temporal Engine room]
843,
844,OLDER AMY [in glass]: The me version of you. I
845,refuse to help them. I won't let them save myself. 
846,AMY: Why?
847,
848,[Amy's lair]
849,
850,"OLDER AMY: If you escape, then I was never trapped"
851,"here. The last thirty six years of my life rewrites, and I cease to"
852,exist. That's why old me refused to help then. That's why I'm refusing
853,to help now. And that's why you'll refuse to help when it's your turn.
854,And nothing you can say will change that.
855,
856,[Past Temporal Engine room]
857,
858,AMY: Three words. What about Rory? 
859,OLDER AMY [in glass]: Rory? 
860,[Amy's lair]
861,
862,OLDER AMY: I called my robot Rory. 
863,AMY [in glass]: You called your robot Rory?
864,
865,[Past Temporal Engine room]
866,
867,"AMY: Oh, so you didn't call it the Doctor, or"
868,Biggles 
869,[Amy's lair]
870,
871,AMY [in glass]: Our favourite cat? 
872,"OLDER AMY: Do you, er, do you "
873,[Past Temporal Engine room]
874,
875,OLDER AMY [in glass]: Remember that summer when he
876,came back to school with that ridiculous haircut? 
877,AMY: He said he'd been in a rock band. 
878,[Amy's lair]
879,
880,"OLDER AMY: Liar. And, and then he had to learn to"
881,play the guitar. 
882,[Past Temporal Engine room]
883,
884,AMY: So we wouldn't know he couldn't play it. Mmm
885,hmm.
886,
887,[Amy's lair]
888,
889,"OLDER AMY: All those boys chasing me, but it was"
890,only ever Rory. Why was that?
891,
892,[Past Temporal Engine room]
893,
894,AMY: You know when sometimes you meet someone so
895,beautiful 
896,[Amy's lair]
897,
898,"AMY [in glass]: And then you actually talk to them,"
899,and five minutes later they're as dull as a brick?
900,
901,[Past Temporal Engine room]
902,
903,"AMY: Then there's other people, and you meet them"
904,"and think, not bad, they're okay. And then you get to know them, and"
905,"their face just sort of becomes them, like their personality's written"
906,all over it. And they just turn into something so beautiful. 
907,BOTH: Rory's the most beautiful man I've ever met. 
908,AMY: Please? Do it for him.
909,
910,[Amy's lair]
911,
912,"OLDER AMY: You're asking me to defy destiny,"
913,"causality, the nexus of time itself, for a boy."
914,
915,[Past Temporal Engine room]
916,
917,"AMY: You're Amy, he's Rory, and oh yes, I am. "
918,[Temporal Engine room]
919,
920,(Rory has been waiting outside all this time.) 
921,OLDER AMY: I am going to pull time apart for you. 
922,(She kisses Rory. Rory the Handbot discreetly turns its back.)
923,
924,[Tardis]
925,
926,"OLDER AMY [in glass]: Okay, Doctor, Twostreams is"
927,"back on air. Right, okay, so this is big news. "
928,[Temporal Engine room]
929,
930,OLDER AMY: This is temporal earthquake time. I am
931,now officially changing my own future. Hold on to your spectacles. In
932,"my past, I saw my future self refuse to help you. I'm now changing that"
933,future and 
934,[Tardis]
935,
936,OLDER AMY [in glass]: Agreeing. Every law of time
937,says that shouldn't be possible. 
938,"DOCTOR: Yes, except sometimes knowing your own future's what enables"
939,"you to change it. Especially if you're bloody minded, contradictory "
940,[Arrivals area]
941,
942,DOCTOR : And completely unpredictable. 
943,"RORY: So basically, if you're Amy, then? "
944,"DOCTOR : Yes, if anyone could defeat pre-destiny, "
945,[Tardis]
946,
947,DOCTOR: It's your wife.
948,
949,[Arrivals area]
950,
951,"OLDER AMY: It's not about what I'm doing, but who"
952,"I'm doing it for. I'm trusting you to watch my back, Rory. "
953,"RORY: Always. You and me, always. "
954,"OLDER AMY: Because here's the deal. You take me, too. In the Tardis. Me"
955,too. 
956,RORY: But that means that there'll be two of you. 
957,[Tardis]
958,
959,RORY [on screen]: Permanently. Forever. 
960,OLDER AMY [on screen]: And that way we both get to live.
961,
962,[Arrivals area]
963,
964,RORY: Two Amys together. Can that work? 
965,DOCTOR : I don't know. 
966,[Tardis]
967,
968,DOCTOR: It's your marriage.
969,
970,[Arrivals area]
971,
972,RORY: Doctor.
973,
974,[Tardis]
975,
976,"DOCTOR: Perhaps. Maybe, if I shunted the reality"
977,"compensators on the Tardis, re-calibrated the Doomsday bumpers and"
978,"jettisoned the karaoke bar, yes. Maybe. Yes. It could do it. The Tardis"
979,could sustain the paradox. 
980,[Arrivals area]
981,
982,RORY: Right. Amy and Amy. 
983,"(Young Amy is there, seen through the Time Glass.) "
984,RORY: The wife and the wife. Right. Right. 
985,[Tardis]
986,
987,"DOCTOR: Okay. Amy, Past Amy, stand by the door."
988,"Future Amy, you too."
989,
990,[Arrivals area]
991,
992,"DOCTOR : Future Amy, can I borrow your sonic"
993,scr 
994,[Tardis]
995,
996,DOCTOR: Probe.
997,
998,[Arrivals area]
999,
1000,OLDER AMY: It's a screwdriver. 
1001,"DOCTOR : Rory, sonic it. Double our power. Amy Now, you're our link"
1002,to Amy Then. 
1003,[Tardis]
1004,
1005,"DOCTOR: We need to get a signal through, and that"
1006,signal 
1007,[Arrivals area]
1008,
1009,DOCTOR : Will be a thought. 
1010,[Tardis]
1011,
1012,"DOCTOR: Amy Now and Amy Then, share a thought."
1013,Something so 
1014,[Arrivals area]
1015,
1016,DOCTOR: Powerful that it can rip through time. Rory
1017,
1018,[Tardis]
1019,
1020,DOCTOR: Sonic the plinth front. Inside you'll find 
1021,[Arrivals area]
1022,
1023,DOCTOR : Three levers and a jumble of wiring. 
1024,[Tardis]
1025,
1026,DOCTOR: That's the regulator valve. After we
1027,"re-route it, you have ten minutes to get back to the Tardis. "
1028,[Arrivals area]
1029,
1030,RORY: Okay. 
1031,[Tardis]
1032,
1033,DOCTOR: Pull out the red and green receptors.
1034,Re-route the blue into the red and
1035,
1036,[Arrivals area]
1037,
1038,DOCTOR : The green into blue. Leave the red
1039,loose and on no account 
1040,[Tardis]
1041,
1042,"DOCTOR: Touch anything yellow. Come on, Rory. It's"
1043,hardly rocket science. It's just 
1044,[Arrivals area]
1045,
1046,DOCTOR: Quantum physics. 
1047,"RORY: Yes, right. Blue into red and then green "
1048,"DOCTOR : Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Now, the levers. "
1049,[Tardis]
1050,
1051,DOCTOR: Throw them in order. 
1052,[Arrivals area]
1053,
1054,"DOCTOR : And Amys, start thinking the most"
1055,important thought you have ever had. 
1056,[Tardis]
1057,
1058,DOCTOR: Hold it in your head and do not let it go.
1059,Lever one. 
1060,[Arrivals area]
1061,
1062,BOTH AMYS: Macarena. Macarena. 
1063,RORY: She's doing the Macarena. 
1064,BOTH AMYS: Macarena. Macarena. 
1065,RORY: Our first kiss.
1066,
1067,[Tardis]
1068,
1069,"DOCTOR: Lever two, Rory. Lever three. "
1070,(The Time Glass and the screen blow out. The past Arrivals area is
1071,empty.)
1072,
1073,[Arrivals area]
1074,
1075,(Both Amys are together.) 
1076,"RORY: Oh, Amy. "
1077,"AMY: Oh, my God. "
1078,"OLDER AMY: Oh, my God. "
1079,(Rory hugs young Amy. Older Amy looks a bit embarrassed.) 
1080,RORY: Sorry. 
1081,OLDER AMY: Hello. 
1082,AMY: Hello. 
1083,BOTH: I don't know what to 
1084,RORY: Weird. 
1085,"BOTH: Okay, this is weird. Right, just stop doing that. "
1086,RORY: How about Amy One speaks first? 
1087,BOTH: Which one's Amy One? 
1088,RORY: Well 
1089,"BOTH: I am. No, I am. Rory? Rory, just stop doing that. "
1090,(The Rory-cam glasses start to spark.)
1091,
1092,[Tardis]
1093,
1094,"DOCTOR: Rory. Rory, take the glasses off. You're"
1095,getting temporal feedback. 
1096,(Bits of the console go bang.) 
1097,"DOCTOR: Whoa! Calm down, dear. Rory, Amy, we've created a massive"
1098,"paradox and the Tardis hates it. She's self-phasing, trying to get out"
1099,"of here. What's the nasty Amy done to you. Just calm down, dear. Hang"
1100,"on in there. Rory, you've got eight minutes left. I'm sorry, you're on"
1101,your own now. 
1102,(The glasses explode.)
1103,
1104,[Arrivals area]
1105,
1106,RORY: I'm not on my own. I've got my wives. 
1107,HANDBOT: Do not be alarmed. 
1108,RORY: Incoming! 
1109,HANDBOT: This is a kindness. 
1110,OLDER AMY: With me. 
1111,(Older Amy gives her younger self a stout staff.)
