25,sisters are standing around the edge of a large pool holding burning
26,torches.) 
27,OHILA: He has asked to see you. His servants seek you everywhere. Will
28,you go? 
29,DOCTOR: No. 
30,OHILA: Why do you always lie? 
31,DOCTOR: Why do you always assume I'm lying? 
32,OHILA: It saves time. The truth - will you go? 
33,DOCTOR: No. 
34,OHILA: When? 
35,DOCTOR: Soon. 
36,OHILA: Why? Did something happen? 
37,DOCTOR: No. 
38,OHILA: Was it recent? 
39,DOCTOR: Yes. 
40,"OHILA: Whatever it was, you owe that creature nothing. "
41,DOCTOR: He and I've known each other a long time. 
42,OHILA: You've been enemies for all of it. 
43,DOCTOR: An enemy's just a friend you don't really know yet. Sorry.
44,"What, was that me being cynical again? "
45,"OHILA: Aren't we friends, Doctor? "
46,DOCTOR: That's different. I don't like you! 
47,OHILA: (laughs) Which means you can trust me. 
48,DOCTOR: You know who to give that to? 
49,(He gives her a large metal disc with engraving on it.) 
50,DOCTOR: I won't go straight away. I'll hang out for a bit. Probably
51,meditate on a rock somewhere. Get myself ready. 
52,OHILA: You are embarking on an enterprise that will end in your
53,destruction. 
54,DOCTOR: You could say that about being born. 
55,"OHILA: Wherever you go, there are people who care enough to find you. "
56,DOCTOR: Look after the universe for me. I've put a lot of work into it.
57,
58,"OHILA: Anyone can hide from an enemy, Doctor. No one from a friend."

66,The Meditation Begins
67,
68,(Hollywood style
69,"Arthurian / Robin Hood fanfare as we fly over a lake and into a castle room, where"
70,"the Doctor is sitting on the floor facing the window, lit by candles. A"
71,fire blazes in a
72,hearth to his left. A bearded man dressed in leather armour with an
73,embossed chest piece enters.)
74,DOCTOR: How many days have I been here?
75,BORS: About three hours. 
76,DOCTOR: Three hours? 
77,"BORS: Well, nearly."
78,DOCTOR: Maybe Clara's right. She keeps telling me I've got Attention Deficit
79,er something or other.
80,(He drinks from the same goblet that Paul McGann used in Night of the
81,Doctor. It doesn't taste nice.)
82,BORS: What is your journey?
83,"DOCTOR: You can't come with me, Bors. "
84,BORS: I'm pledged to your service ever since you saved my life.
85,DOCTOR: I didn't save your life. You had a splinter.
86,"BORS: Where is it you go, and why must you meditate first?"
87,DOCTOR: Someone I know is very sick. He'll want to see me before
88,(pause) while
89,there's still time.
90,BORS: An old friend?
91,DOCTOR: Someone I've known a very long time.
92,"BORS: If there is danger, let me ride at your side."
93,"DOCTOR: You can't help me, not where I'm going. I have to get myself"
94,ready. I have to be alone. I have to think. No more distractions.
95,"BORS: As you wish, Sir Doctor."
96,(He turns to leave. The Doctor takes another drink from the goblet.)
97,DOCTOR: Urgh. Hang on a minute. (stands up) The water. 
98,"BORS: The water, sir?"
99,DOCTOR: I don't like it. I
100,can't meditate properly without decent water. 
101,(He hands the goblet to Bors and walks out. Bors sniffs the liquid.)
102,
103,[Outside the castle]
104,
105,"(Outside the castle, peasants"
106,are following the Doctor with shovels.) 
107,"DOCTOR: We're going to dig a well! Right on, er,"
108,this spot. There will be excellent water here.
109,BORS: How'd you know?
110,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm very good at water."
111,(Day 5)
112,DOCTOR: This is definitely a good spot for water.
113,BORS: But this is the twelfth place you've made us dig.
114,"DOCTOR: Well, twelve is my lucky number. "
115,(Groans from the peasants. Days 8-11.)
116,"DOCTOR: Here. No, here. Look at this grass. This is"
117,watery grass. Follow the squelchy.
118,(Day 12. The deep stone-lined well is complete and the workers
119,exhausted. Bors draws a bucket of
120,water.)
121,"BORS: Well, you've all the water you need now and it is the finest in"
122,the land. Your meditation can begin.
123,"DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose it can. Except. "
124,BORS: Except? 
125,DOCTOR: Do you know what this
126,well really needs?
127,BORS: Nothing. It's perfect.
128,DOCTOR: A visitor's centre.
129,(Bors lets the bucket drop back down the well. 
130,Day 17. The Doctor is making coins disappear from his
131,"hands whilst sitting in a deck chair by a camp fire and imitating Tommy Cooper, when"
132,Bors walks up to him.)
133,"BORS: Everyone has agreed on the plan for the throne room extension,"
134,but we're we're not quite sure what you mean by a sun roof.
135,DOCTOR: Look at this coin. You see it?
136,BORS: (putting down his armful of scrolls) I see it. 
137,(The Doctor waves his hands about.)
138,DOCTOR: Where is it now?
139,BORS: There. (pointing to the correct hand.)
140,"DOCTOR: No, it isn't."
141,"BORS: Yes, it is. I saw it."
142,DOCTOR: Are you sure? I'm really a very good magician.
143,BORS: What is it you dread?
144,DOCTOR: Why would I dread anything?
145,"BORS: You're always making jokes. You never sit still, like you're"
146,running in fear of days to come.
147,DOCTOR: I thought you were an idiot.
148,BORS: I know. I thought that too.
149,DOCTOR: Good. I was worried I would have to break it to you
150,
151,[Doctor's room]
152,
153,(Day 21 - they climb the stairs to the chamber.)
154,BORS: Are you sure?
155,"DOCTOR: I've been avoiding it. One last night, then I have to go."
156,BORS: Do you wish to be alone?
157,DOCTOR: I have to prepare myself.
158,BORS: But why? You've never explained.
159,(The Doctor rearranges the candles.)
160,DOCTOR: I did something wrong. I let somebody down when I should have
161,been brave enough and strong enough to do better. Tomorrow I pay the
162,"price. Tonight, I make myself ready."
163,(He sits down.)
164,"BORS: Goodbye, Magician. You have widened my mind."
165,(The Doctor stands and puts his hand on Bors' shoulder.)
166,DOCTOR: You do realise you're still an idiot.
167,BORS: Yeah.
168,DOCTOR: Good. I have to be quiet now. Quiet as the grave.
169,BORS: I do not believe you are capable of silence.
170,"DOCTOR: Oh? Oh, well, we'll see about that, shall we?"
171,"BORS: We shall, Sir Doctor."
172,(Bors leaves and the Doctor makes chalk marks on the floor whilst muttering to himself.)
173,DOCTOR: No more distractions. Got to focus. No more distractions. Bors! 
174,(Bors returns.)
175,DOCTOR: Are you any good with a broadsword?
176,BORS: Yes.
177,(The Doctor holds up his spoon.)
178,DOCTOR: Fancy a friendly?
179,"BORS: Enough, Magician! I do not believe that you will meditate. It is"
180,not
181,in your nature. If this is to be your last night here then we shall
182,"celebrate. There shall be revels. But first past, tell me your story."
183,Tell
184,me how you came to this place and why now you are compelled to leave
185,it. I
186,will not depart this room until you do so.
187,DOCTOR: (standing) I suppose I do owe you.
188,"BORS: I have served you loyally, Sir Doctor."
189,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, you have."
190,BORS: Then begin your tale.
191,"DOCTOR: Well, a little while ago, a very long way from here, I was"
192,"looking for a bookshop. Instead, I found a battlefield. Story of my"
193,life. I've seen many battlefields. But this one will be different. This
194,one will be my last.

203,SOLDIER: Spread out! Get down!
204,(Straight
205,"in from the previous, three biplane buzz soldiers with quivers on their"
206,"backs, but it fires laser bolts not bullets. One soldier aims an arrow at one as it"
207,"flies off, then turns to see a young boy running in the opposite"
208,"direction, into the smoke. A siren sounds, then another soldier runs"
209,up.) 
210,SOLDIER: What's wrong?
211,KANZO: Was that a child?
212,"(The boy is breathless, but still running.)"
213,"KANZO: Hey! You there, stop! Stop running! "
214,(The boy stops.)
215,KANZO: It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you. Just don't run.
216,SOLDIER: Kanzo?
217,KANZO: I'll catch up.
218,SOLDIER: There are clam drones two miles away.
219,KANZO: I know. I'll be fine. Just go. 
220,(The soldier runs back.) 
221,"KANZO: What are you doing out here, huh? Did you get lost?"
222,(The ground ripples.)
223,KANZO: Stay still. Stay absolutely still.
224,(Kanzo gets out a small hand-held scanner.)
225,KANZO: I'm just scanning the ground. I think we've got company. Do you
226,know what hand mines are? 
227,(The boy nods.)
228,"KANZO: Well, in that case you know you've got to stand absolutely"
229,still. Right? 
230,(Another nod.)
231,KANZO: Have you ever seen a hand mine? (nod) Where? 
232,"(He follows the boy's gaze to his own foot, which has a hand from out"
233,of the ground clamped around his ankle.)
234,KANZO: Okay. It's okay. Everything's going to be fine
235,(Whereupon Kanzo is suddenly pulled underground. Then more hands come
236,"out of the mud and turn around. They have eyes in their palms, and stop"
237,when they see the boy.)
238,"BOY: Help me! Someone, please! Help me! Help me!"
239,(A sonic screwdriver flies through the air and lands at his feet.)
240,DOCTOR : Your chances of survival are about one in a thousand. So
241,"here's what you do. You forget the thousand, and you concentrate on the"
242,"one. Pick it up. I said, pick it up!"
243,(The boy obeys.)
244,"DOCTOR : I'm straight ahead of you, about fifty feet. Can you see"
245,me? 
246,(The smoke clears to reveal the Tardis and the Doctor.)
247,"DOCTOR: The device in your hand is creating an acoustic corridor, so"
248,that we can talk. Do you understand?
249,BOY: Who are you?
250,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm just a passer-by. I was looking for a bookshop. How do"
251,you think I'm doing?
252,BOY: This isn't a bookshop.
253,"DOCTOR: No, this is a war. A very old one, going by the mix of"
254,technology. Which war is this? I get them all muddled up.
255,BOY: It's just the war.
256,DOCTOR: Where am I? What planet is this?
257,BOY: I don't understand.
258,"DOCTOR: Well, neither do I. I try never to understand. It's called an"
259,"open mind. Now, you have got to make a choice."
260,BOY: A choice?
261,"DOCTOR: Yes, you have got to decide that you're going to live. Survival"
262,is just a choice. Choose it now.
263,"BOY: If I move, they'll get me."
264,"DOCTOR: I told you, you have one chance in a thousand. But one is all"
265,"you ever need. What's your name? Come on, faith in the future."
266,Introduce yourself! Tell me the name of the boy who isn't going to die
267,today.
268,"BOY: Davros. My name is Davros. Hello? Are you still there? Please,"
269,you've got to help me. You said I could survive. You said you'd help
270,me. Help me!

292,SHADOW ARCHITECT: Apparently we have a security breach. I won't ask how
293,"you got in here, but I will demand to know your business, Colony Sarff."
294,COLONY SARFF: Where is the Doctor?
295,"SHADOW ARCHITECT: I've no idea. He's not our concern, and he's"
296,certainly not your employer's.
297,COLONY SARFF: The Doctor is required.
298,"SHADOW ARCHITECT: For what? Colony Sarff, you need to tell me. What"
299,does Davros want with the Doctor?
300,(Sarff turns and leaves.)

308,COLONY SARFF: Where is the Doctor?

310,"carefully when you seek the Doctor, Colony Sarff, or he will be the"
311,last thing you find.
312,"COLONY: Davros, creator of the Daleks, dark Lord of Skaro."

314,COLONY SARFF: Davros is dying.
315,OHILA: Davros is ancient. He should have been dust centuries ago.
316,COLONY SARFF: He has a message for the Doctor.
317,OHILA: Then you will give it to me.
318,(Colony Sarff writhes as if trying to change shape or something.)
319,OHILA: Your powers mean nothing here. Give me the message and leave.

332,DAVROS: No. I am anticipating.

397,KATE: He's not answering his phone. Have you tried?
398,CLARA: We don't know enough yet. He doesn't appreciate gossip.
399,KATE: Gossip?
400,CLARA: How many planes?
401,"JAC: 4,165 aircraft currently airborne. "

405,"CLARA: Okay, so, what could you do with 4,000 flying bombs?"
406,"JAC: Ah, well, 439 nuclear power stations currently active."
407,KATE: What else?
408,"CLARA: I dunno. Er, fault lines. Earthquake, a tsunami?"
409,JAC: Running simulations now.
410,KATE: So this is an attack? 
411,CLARA: What kind of an attack advertises? Why show somebody what you
412,can do? Why not just do it? What's actually happened to the planes?
413,What are the pilots saying?
414,"KATE: We, we can't contact them."
415,"JAC: The planes haven't stopped. They're actually frozen. Like, frozen"

418,"CLARA: Kate, we can't just phone the Doctor and bleat, he'll go"
419,Scottish. Come on. What have we got? What do we know? It's not an
420,"attack, it's not an invasion, because, well, that doesn't come with a"
421,"fair warning. So, somebody needs our attention. Somebody who needs to"

445,"east, this coffee is a buzz-monster in my brain, and I'm going to need"
446,eight snipers.
447,KATE: Eight what?
448,"MISSY : Three for each heart, and two for my brain stem. You'll"
449,"have to switch me off fast, before I can regenerate. How fast can you"
450,"get here? Ooo, I'll need to arrange you a flight corridor. "
451,(Missy licks her finger before pressing buttons on her controller.)

462,"MISSY: Oh, saucy."
463,(Then she uses her compact mirror to check that the other two are

469,"MISSY: How's your boyfriend? Still tremendously dead, I expect."
470,"CLARA: Still dead, yeah. How come you're still alive?"

475,"MISSY: Better? I expect you've tried to contact him by now. Well, you"
476,"should know, I can't find him either. No one can."
477,"CLARA: That happens, now and then."
478,MISSY: Not like this. 
479,(She puts the etched disc from the Prologue on the table. The one the
480,Doctor gave to Ohila.)
481,MISSY: It's a confession dial.
482,CLARA: A what?
483,"MISSY: In your terms, a will. The Last Will and Testament of the Time"
484,"Lord known as the Doctor, to be delivered, according to ancient"
485,"tradition, to his closest friend, on the eve of his final day. "
486,"(Clara reaches for it, and gets an electric shock.)"
487,"MISSY: Ah, ah! What are you doing?"
488,CLARA: You said. I thought.
489,"MISSY: No, no, no, no, no. It was delivered to me."
490,CLARA: You?
491,MISSY: Well of course it was sent to me. What have you got to do with
492,it? I'm his friend. You're just
493,CLARA: I'm just what?
494,MISSY: See that couple over there? 
495,(A man and a woman walk through with their dog.)
496,MISSY: You're the puppy.
497,CLARA: Since when do you care about the Doctor?
498,MISSY: Since always. Since the Cloister Wars. Since the night he stole
499,the moon and the President's wife. Since he was a little girl. One of
500,those was a lie. Can you guess which one?
501,CLARA: He's not your friend. You keep trying to kill him.
502,MISSY: He keeps trying to kill me. It's sort of our texting. We've been
503,at it for ages.
504,CLARA: Mmm. Must be love.
505,"MISSY: Oh, don't be disgusting. We're Time Lords, not animals. Try,"
506,"nano-brain, to rise above the reproductive frenzy of your noisy little"
507,"food chain, and contemplate friendship. A friendship older than your"
508,"civilisation, and infinitely more complex."
509,CLARA: So the Doctor is your bezzy mate and I'm supposed to believe
510,that you've turned good?
511,MISSY: Good?
512,(Missy uses her controller to disintegrate a Secret Service man.)
513,SOLDIER : Man down!

540,(The man obeys.)

542,MISSY: Say something nice.
543,CLARA: No.
544,MISSY: I'll kill everyone in this square.
545,"CLARA: Start with me. Then what, hey? You came"
546,here for my help.
547,MISSY: Because the Doctor is in danger.
548,CLARA: Make me believe you.
549,MISSY: How?
550,CLARA: Release the planes.
551,"MISSY: The planes are keeping me alive. I mean, there's one, two,"
552,"three, four, five, six, seven, eight naughty little snipers ready to"
553,kill me.
554,CLARA: Yeah. On my command. 
555,(Clara holds up her arm.)

570,MISSY: What does what say?
571,CLARA: His confession.
572,MISSY: It will only open when he's dead.
573,"CLARA: Then it won't open, will it?"
574,"MISSY: Question. If the Doctor has one last night to live, if he's"
575,"certain he's facing the end of his life, where, in all of space and"
576,"time, would he go?"
577,CLARA: Here.

633,"According to you, this is where the Doctor is."

644,BORS: Dude! What is that?
645,DOCTOR: You said you wanted an axe fight.
646,(Some chuckles.)
647,"DOCTOR: Oh, come on. In a few hundred years, that'll be really funny."
648,It's a slow burner.
649,BORS: A musical instrument is not an axe.
650,"DOCTOR: Yes, and a daffodil is not a broadsword, but I still won the"
651,last round!
652,(The crowd cheers.)
653,"DOCTOR: What do you think of my tank? Don't worry, it isn't loaded."
654,BORS: I don't like it.
655,"DOCTOR: No, neither do I. I bought it for my fish."
656,BORS: Your fish?
657,DOCTOR: I may have ordered online!
658,(Complete silence.)
659,"DOCTOR: Oh, come on. Fish? Tank? Honestly, this stuff will be hilarious"
660,in a very few hundred years. Do please stick around.
661,CLARA: What's the matter with him? He's never like this.
662,"MISSY: Oh, you really are new, aren't you?"
663,"(The Doctor looks up at the ramparts, directly at Clara.) "
664,"CLARA: Wait, hang on. Did he just hear that? He doesn't know we're"
665,"here, does he?"
666,(The Doctor plays the opening of Pretty Woman.)
667,"DOCTOR: Now, you lot. I have been here all day, and it's been a great"
668,day!
669,BORS: You've been here for three weeks.
670,"DOCTOR: Three weeks? It must be nearly bedtime. Well, we've partied."
671,(Cheers.)
672,"DOCTOR: Yes! I helped you dig a well, with a first-class,"
673,child-friendly visitor's centre! I've given you some top-notch maths
674,tuition in a fun but relevant way. And I have also introduced the word
675,"""dude"" several centuries early. Let me hear you!"
676,ALL: Dude!
677,DOCTOR: Are you a Renaissance?
678,ALL: Dude!
679,DOCTOR: Are you a Medieval?
680,ALL: Dude! 
681,(He points at a young man in armour.)
682,DOCTOR: I am a dragon-slaying?

684,DOCTOR: We are all the young?
685,ALL: Dudes!
686,"DOCTOR: I like it. But I've got some sad news for you, dudes. Tonight,"
687,I'm going to have to leave you.
688,(Cries of no!)
689,"DOCTOR: But before I do, I'd like you to meet a couple of friends of"
690,mine.
691,"(Ahs from the crowd, then applause and cheering. Clara enters the courtyard"
692,and waves shyly.)
693,CLARA: How did you know I was here? Did you see me?
694,DOCTOR: When do I not see you?
695,"CLARA: What, one face in all of that crowd?"
696,"DOCTOR: There was a crowd, too?"
697,"CLARA: Wow, we're doing charm as well, now, are we? Which one of us is"
698,dying? 
699,(The Doctor suddenly hugs Clara.)
700,"CLARA: Okay. And we're doing hugging now, too. I can't keep up."
701,"DOCTOR: Well, you know what they say. Hugging is a great way to hide"
702,your face.
703,"CLARA: Okay, look. I guessed a party, but not like this. What is this?"
704,This isn't you.
705,"DOCTOR: I spent all day yesterday in a bow tie, the day before in a"
706,"long scarf. It's my party, and all of me is invited."
707,(He riffs Mickie as Missy enters.)
708,"MISSY: What the hell are you up to, man?"
709,DOCTOR: It's the wicked stepmother! Everyone hiss!
710,(Discordant chord and hisses as Missy bows and flourishes her
711,handkerchief.)
712,"MISSY: Apparently, you think you're going to die tomorrow. "
713,(She holds up the confession disc.)
714,"DOCTOR: Well, I've got some good news about that."
715,"MISSY: Oh, yeah?"
716,DOCTOR: It's still today!
717,"MISSY: Oh, that's very good."
718,"(Guitar wah, wah, wah. Bors starts choking.)"
719,DOCTOR: Bors. Is it a marble again? Did you swallow one of the marbles
720,I gave you? Don't swallow marbles!
721,(The Doctor pulls a banded snake from around Bors' throat and throws it
722,away.

724,COLONY SARFF: Doctor. Your friends have led me to you. You will come.
725,DOCTOR: Says you and whose army?
726,"(The segments of Sarff's face turn in different directions, like the coils of"
727,a snake. Its robe drops to reveal that it is a giant serpent with lots
728,of small snakes around it. The crowd flee.)
729,"DOCTOR: Nobody dies here. Not one person, not one of my friends, do you"
730,understand?
731,"COLONY SARFF: Davros, creator of the Daleks, dark lord of Skaro, is"
732,dying.
733,DOCTOR: So I hear.
734,COLONY SARFF: He would speak with you again on the last night of his
735,life.
736,DOCTOR: Then you will harm nobody in this place. Not one person. Are we
737,"very, very clear?"
738,(Sarff recoils itself into its humanoid form.)
739,"COLONY SARFF: Are you so dangerous, little man?"
740,DOCTOR: You want to know how dangerous I am? Davros sent you.
741,You know
742,how stupid you are? Huh! You came!
743,(Sarff hisses.)
744,"DOCTOR: Is that supposed to frighten me? Snake nest in a dress? Now,"
745,"explain, politely. Davros is my arch-enemy. Why would I want to talk to"
746,him?
747,"MISSY: No, wait, hang on a minute. Davros is your"
748,arch-enemy now?
749,DOCTOR: Hush!
750,MISSY: I'll scratch his eye out.
751,COLONY SARFF: Davros knows. Davros remembers. 
752,(Sarff holds out the sonic screwdriver then throws it to the ground
753,"near the Doctor, who hangs his head.)"
754,CLARA: That's yours.
755,"DOCTOR: Er, it was."
756,CLARA: Was?
757,DOCTOR: I don't have a screwdriver any more.
758,"MISSY: Ooo. Never seen that before. Doctor, the"
759,look on your face. What
760,is that?
761,CLARA: Shame. You're ashamed. Doctor? What have you done?

769,"MISSY: Doctor, listen to me. I know traps, traps are my flirting. This"
770,is a trap.
771,DOCTOR: I am prepared.
772,MISSY: You sent me your confession dial. You threw yourself a
773,three week party. You know what this is.
774,"DOCTOR: Yes. Goodbye. (sotto) Goodbye, Clara."
775,"(He turns around, and one of Sarff's colony of snakes binds the Doctor's wrists behind his"

779,too.)

798,"wouldn't end. A thousand years of fighting, till nobody could remember"
799,"why. So Davros, he created a new kind of warrior, one that wouldn't"
800,"bother with that question. A mutant in a tank that would never, ever"
801,stop. And they never did.
802,CLARA: The Daleks?

822,"CLARA: My point is, we both saw her die on Earth, ages ago. And"
823,"obviously you knew that wasn't real. Or worse, hoped it wasn't. Either"
824,"way, I think you've been lying."
825,DOCTOR: I'm sorry.

833,"MISSY: Oh, yeah. You know what's wrong with the gravity in here?"
834,CLARA: No.

879,DOCTOR 10 [Stolen Earth]: Everything we saw. Everything we lost.
880,DOCTOR 6 [Revelation of the Daleks]: But did you bother to tell anyone
881,they might be eating their own relatives?
882,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, okay, you've made your point."
883,DAVROS: Have I?
884,DOCTOR 4 [on screen]: If someone who knew the future pointed out a
885,"child to you, and told you that that child would grow up totally evil,"
886,"to be a ruthless dictator who would destroy millions of lives, could"
887,you then kill that child? 
888,(The Doctor turns off the recordings.)
889,DOCTOR: I get the point.
890,"DAVROS: Do you know why you came, Doctor? You have a sense of duty. Of"
891,"guilt, perhaps. And certainly of shame."
892,DOCTOR: You flatter me.
893,DAVROS: Pity. I intended to accuse. I believe that for the ultimate
894,"good of the universe, I was right to create the Daleks."
895,DOCTOR: You were very wrong.
896,DAVROS: This is the argument we've had since we met.
897,DOCTOR: It ended in the Time War.
898,DAVROS: It survived the Time War. But it will end tonight. That is why
899,you are here.

915,And that is not a space station. That is a building. And the rest of
916,"the planet, the whole thing, is invisible. "
917,(Clara dances around.)
918,CLARA: That's ridiculous.

956,
957,[Control room]
958,
959,(Missy and Clara are brought in.)
960,CLARA:
961,The Tardis. How did she get here?
962,DALEK SUPREME: It has been procured.
963,(The Red Dalek is on a raised dais. A big laser gun is lowered from the
964,"ceiling. Other Daleks from other eras mill about, including the old Battle Dalek.)"
965,"CLARA: Yeah? Yeah, well, if you're trying to get inside, you can't."
966,Nothing can enter the Tardis.
967,DALEK SUPREME: The Tardis will not be entered. The Tardis will be
968,destroyed. 
969,"CLARA: (chuckles) Yeah, well, good luck, because she's indestructible."
970,MISSY: Did the Doctor tell you that? Because you should never believe a
971,man about a vehicle.
972,
973,[Davros' room]
974,
975,"DOCTOR: What are they going to do? Tell me, what?"
976,DAVROS: Who can say? You know what children are like.
977,MISSY [on screen]: Daleks! Pay attention!
978,DOCTOR: (sotto) Don't. Just don't.
979,
980,[Control room / Davros' room]
981,
982,(Missy's speech is split between live action and
983,"on-screen, and I cannot be bothered to type that..)"
984,MISSY: You know what this is? This thing you're about to destroy? I'll
985,"tell you! It's the dog's unmentionables. And you know all about those,"
986,don't you? 
987,(Missy tickles a Dalek's ball.)
988,"MISSY: This is a Tardis. With this, you can go anywhere, do"
989,"anything, kill anyone. With this, the Daleks can be more powerful than"
990,ever before. 
991,(She climbs up onto a
992,ledge opposite the Tardis and the Daleks all turn to look at her. Clara is
993,trying to edge towards the door.)
994,MISSY: You just need one thing.
995,"DOCTOR: (sotto) No. Missy, no!"
996,"MISSY: Me. You need me. A Time Lady, to show you how it works. With"
997,"this and with me, everything can be yours. And you can burn it all, for"
998,ever and ever and ever. (long pause) Or would you rather just kill me?
999,(The Daleks turn to their leader.)
1000,DALEK SUPREME: Maximum extermination.
1001,DALEK: Exterminate. 
1002,(The Daleks fire. Missy's skeleton is briefly visible before she is
1003,completely gone.)
1004,
1005,[Davros' room]
1006,
1007,"DOCTOR: Please! Please, I'm begging you. Please,"
1008,"please. Please, save Clara."
1009,DAVROS: I gave the Daleks life. I do not control them. 
1010,(The Daleks all turn to face Clara.)
1011,"DOCTOR: (sotto) Oh, Clara. Oh, my Clara."
1012,DAVROS: See how they play with her. See how they toy. They want her to
1013,run. They need her to run. Do you feel their
1014,"need, Doctor? Their blood"
1015,"is screaming kill, kill, kill! Hunter and prey, held in the ecstasy of"
1016,crisis. Is this not life at its purest?
1017,
1018,[Control room]
1019,
1020,(Clara runs for the open door.)
1021,DALEK: Exterminate! Exterminate!
1022,(They fire. Clara screams and vanishes.)
1023,
1024,[Davros' room]
1025,
1026,DOCTOR: Why have I ever let you live?
1027,"DAVROS: Compassion, Doctor. It has always been your greatest"
1028,"indulgence. Let this be my final victory. Let me hear you say it, just"
1029,once. Compassion is wrong.
1030,
1031,[Control room]
1032,
1033,DALEK SUPREME: Destroy the Tardis!
1034,DALEKS: Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy!

1041,(Then the white clears to reveal us back where we
1042,started.)
1043,YOUNG DAVROS: Help me! You can't leave me! You promised. You said I had
1044,a chance.
1045,(The Tardis door opens. He turns.)
1046,YOUNG DAVROS: Who are you? I don't get it. How did you get there?
1047,DOCTOR: From the future.
1048,YOUNG DAVROS: Are you going to save me?
1049,DOCTOR: I'm going to save my friend the only way I can.
1050,(He takes aim with a Dalek gun.)
