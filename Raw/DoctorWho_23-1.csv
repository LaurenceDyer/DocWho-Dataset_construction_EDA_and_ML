21, [Space Station] 
22," (As the updated theme tune closes, a bell tolls"
23,and we zoom in on then tour a massive space station. A circular hatch
24,"opens and a beam of light lances out into the void, ensnaring the"
25,Tardis and dragging it in. The Tardis materialises by a staircase and
26,"the Doctor stumbles out. He shakes his head to clear it, then goes up"
27,"the steps and nearly knocks on the doors at the top. Changing his mind,"
28,he pushes them open and walks into -) 
29, [Trial room]
30,
31, (A darkened room. A figure sits in a pew. Everyone
32,say Hi! to  Michael
33,Jayston.) 
34,"VALEYARD: At last, Doctor. "
35,DOCTOR: Am I late for something? 
36,VALEYARD: I was beginning to fear you had lost yourself. Sit down. 
37,"(The Doctor moves to where the Valeyard indicates, to discover a chair."
38,The Valeyard then turns on the lights and we see that the chair is in a
39,dock.) 
40,"DOCTOR: Well, even I would find it hard to lose myself in a corridor."
41,"Especially, when propelled by the mental energy of so many"
42,distinguished Time Lords. 
43,(The Doctor waves at a group of shadowy figures in the formal Time Lord
44,costume sitting in two raised rows of pews by the wall to his left.) 
45,"VALEYARD: Oh, I don't know. You seem to have a great talent for"
46,straying from the straight and narrow. 
47,(Citadel guards enter and the lights come up to full as a woman in
48,white robe with a red scarf is escorted to a separate chair and table
49,below the rows of Time Lords. Everyone wave Hi! to  Lynda Bellingham.) 
50,DOCTOR: Would it be too much to ask what all this is about? 
51,INQUISITOR: The accused will remain silent until invited to speak. 
52,DOCTOR: The accused? Do you mean me? 
53,INQUISITOR: I call upon the Valeyard to open the case. 
54,"VALEYARD: By order of the High Council, this is an impartial enquiry"
55,"into the behaviour of the accused person, known as the Doctor, who is"
56,"charged that he, on diverse occasions has been guilty of conduct"
57,unbecoming a Time Lord. 
58,DOCTOR: Not guilty! 
59,"VALEYARD: He is also charged with, on diverse occasions, transgressing"
60,"the First Law. It is my unpleasant task, Madam Inquisitor, to prove to"
61,the enquiry that the Doctor is an incorrigible meddler in the affairs
62,of other peoples and planets. 
63,"INQUISITOR: Yes. I see, Valeyard, that it is on record that the Doctor"
64,has faced trial already for offences of this nature. 
65,"VALEYARD: That is so, my lady, and I shall contend that the High"
66,Council showed too great a leniency on that occasion. 
67,"INQUISITOR: Very well. Doctor, you've heard the charges. Do you wish to"
68,say anything before the enquiry proceeds? 
69,DOCTOR: Only that this whole thing is a farce. I am Lord President of
70,Gallifrey. You can't put me on trial. 
71,"INQUISITOR: Doctor, since you willfully neglected the responsibility of"
72,"your great office, you were deposed. "
73,DOCTOR: Oh. Is that legal? 
74,INQUISITOR: Perfectly. But we won't hold it against you. Quite the
75,"contrary in fact. And to see that your interests are fully protected, I"
76,propose to appoint a court defender to represent you. 
77,"DOCTOR: Ah, oh, er, thank you, but no thank you. I have been through"
78,several such inquiries before. I think it would be easier if I speak
79,for myself. 
80,INQUISITOR: The court notes the Doctor refuses the services of a court
81,"defender. Proceed, Valeyard. "
82,"VALEYARD: Inquisitor, I am not proposing to waste the time of the court"
83,by dwelling in detail on the activities of the accused. 
84,DOCTOR: Good. 
85,"VALEYARD: Instead, I intend to adumbrate two typical instances from"
86,separate epistopic interfaces of the spectrum. These examples of the
87,"criminal behaviour of the accused are fully recorded in the Matrix, the"
88,repository of all knowledge. 
89, DOCTOR: Objection. 
90,INQUISITOR: I hear the accused. What is this objection? 
91,DOCTOR: The Matrix does not contain all knowledge. It merely contains
92,all Time Lord knowledge. 
93,INQUISITOR: It has long been accepted that the Matrix is the repository
94,of all knowledge. 
95,"DOCTOR: Well, that only shows the insular complacency of this society."
96,How do you know that there isn't knowledge that you don't possess? 
97,INQUISITOR: All that is known is within the Matrix. 
98,"DOCTOR: Oh, a micro-organism in a drop of water might think it knows"
99,the universe. All it knows is that drop of water. 
100,"VALEYARD: I think this is merely a semantic point, my lady. "
101,INQUISITOR: I agree. I find the objection of the accused to be not
102,valid. Please continue. 
103,"VALEYARD: Thank you, my lady.  (Everyone in the court turns"
104,to a screen high on the wall above the ranks of Time Lords.) 
105,VALEYARD: I should like to begin with the Doctor's involvement in the
106,"affairs of Ravalox, a planet within the Stellian galaxy."
107,
108,[Ravalox]
109,
110,(The Tardis materialises and Peri steps
111,out. It is raining.) 
112,"PERI: Oh, great. "
113,DOCTOR: Hang on. 
114,(The Doctor fetches a jacket and umbrella.) 
115,DOCTOR: There. 
116,"PERI: Can't we come back some other time, like when it's not raining? "
117,"DOCTOR: Oh, stop whinging. "
118,PERI: I don't understand why you wanted to come here in the first
119,place. 
120,DOCTOR: Then you should have listened more carefully. 
121,(The Doctor walks off.) 
122,PERI: Hey! Don't I get some? 
123,"DOCTOR: Oh, sorry."
124,
125,[Trial room]
126,
127,"VALEYARD: I draw your attention, my lady,"
128,to the admission of the accused that he obtained access to confidential
129,material from Gallifrey. A file privy only to members of the High
130,Council. 
131,"INQUISITOR: That is noted. Doctor, why did you go to Ravalox? "
132,DOCTOR: Simple scientific curiosity. I'm not so egotistic as to believe
133,all knowledge is at my fingertips. 
134,"INQUISITOR: Your crude sarcasm is also noted. I should warn you,"
135,"Doctor, that your hostile attitude is not helpful. "
136,"DOCTOR: I'm not here to help. And while you're making all those notes,"
137,do please note that I did not have access to confidential material. The
138,fireball that destroyed Ravalox is documented in Extinct Civilisations
139,by Warris Bossard. 
140,"ORDERLY: This is true, my lady. "
141,INQUISITOR: I see. I find the point that the Doctor gained access to
142,"confidential material to be not proven, unless you have further"
143,"evidence, Valeyard. "
144,"VALEYARD: It is not of great importance, my lady. "
145,INQUISITOR: Continue. 
146,VALEYARD: Most certainly.
147,
148,[Ravalox]
149,
150,(The Doctor and Peri are strolling in an autumnal
151,"forest, under a large and garish golf"
152,"umbrella. We're back at the Queen Elizabeth Country Park, Horndean.) "
153,PERI: I don't think I like Ravalox very much. It reminds me of a wet
154,November back on Earth. 
155,DOCTOR: Now that's part of the reason why we're here. 
156,PERI: Huh? 
157,"DOCTOR: Well, Ravalox has the same mass, angle of tilt and period of"
158,rotation as Earth. 
159,PERI: So? 
160,DOCTOR: Well I thought that was quite interesting. It's unusual to find
161,"two planets so similar. In fact, it's quite a phenomenon. "
162,"PERI: Oh, pity it couldn't be a dry one. "
163,DOCTOR: Ravalox also has the distinction of having been destroyed by a
164,solar fireball. 
165,PERI: It doesn't look very destroyed. 
166,"DOCTOR: According to the records on Gallifrey, it was devastated by a"
167,"solar fireball some five centuries ago. I think somebody exaggerated,"
168,don't you? 
169,PERI: Hmm. 
170,DOCTOR: Hmm. 
171,"(A little further on, the drizzle has stopped so the Doctor puts the"
172,umbrella down.) 
173,"DOCTOR: Ah, the exhilarating smell of a freshly laundered forest. Can't"
174,beat it. 
175,PERI: And the twittering of tiny birds and the rustling of small
176,mammals as they forage for food in the undergrowth. 
177,DOCTOR: Exactly. 
178,PERI: Then you've better hearing than me. There aren't any birds.
179,Listen. 
180,DOCTOR: I wondered when you'd notice. 
181,PERI: None of this makes any sense. Any soil left after the visitation
182,of a fireball would be sterile. 
183,DOCTOR: Well done. 
184,PERI: Don't patronise me Doctor. You knew from the start this amount of
185,growth wasn't possible. 
186,"DOCTOR: I also knew, that as a student of botany, you'd soon realise"
187,the truth without any prompting from me. 
188,PERI: Maybe. 
189,DOCTOR: Yeah. 
190,PERI: Is there any intelligent life here? 
191,"DOCTOR: Apart from me, you mean? I don't know. Shall we find out? "
192,"(As the Doctor and Peri move off down a path, they are watched by a"
193,pair of
194,men. The younger one speaks to Tony
195,Selby.) 
196,"DIBBER: Well, they're not from round here, Mister Glitz. "
197,"GLITZ: I know that, Dibber. "
198,(The Doctor spots something by the path.) 
199,DOCTOR: Ah ha! Look at this. 
200,(It is a necklace. He hooks it up with the umbrella.) 
201,DOCTOR: We are certainly not on this planet alone. Mmm hmm. Let's
202,"reconnoiter, shall we? "
203,(The two men prepare their weapons. Glitz screws a silencer onto his
204,gun.) 
205,"GLITZ: You know, Dibber, I'm the product of a broken home. "
206,"DIBBER: You have mentioned it on occasions, Mister Glitz. "
207,GLITZ: Which sort of unbalanced me. Made me selfish to the point where
208,I cannot stand competition. 
209,"DIBBER: Know the feeling only too well, Mister Glitz. "
210,"GLITZ: Where as yours is a simple case of sociopathy, Dibber, my"
211,"malaise is much more complex. A deep-rooted maladjustment, my"
212,psychiatrist said. Brought on by an infantile inability to come to
213,"terms with the more pertinent, concrete aspects of life. "
214,"DIBBER: That sounds more like an insult than a diagnosis, Mister Glitz."
215,
216,"GLITZ: You're right there, my lad. Mind you, I had just attempted to"
217,"kill him. Oh, I do hate prison psychiatrists, don't you? I mean, they"
218,"do nothing for you. I must have seen dozens of them, and I still hate"
219,competition. Especially when it poaches my territory. I'm going to
220,enjoy this. 
221,"(Glitz has the Doctor in the cross-hairs of his viewfinder, then the"
222,Doctor drops out of sight.) 
223,"GLITZ: Too late! Oh, I do hate it when people get lucky. It really"
224,offends my sensibilities. 
225,DIBBER: Shouldn't we go after them? 
226,"GLITZ: How is it they know where to look? Tell me that, Dibber. "
227,DIBBER: I don't know. Maybe they've all copied the same map we did. Do
228,you want me to go after them? 
229,GLITZ: Why? Do you want to help them? 
230,"DIBBER: No, it's just that if we're after the same thing as us "
231,GLITZ: Don't worry. They'll soon be dead. It's just that I wanted the
232,personal pleasure of killing them myself. 
233,(The Doctor and Peri have gone down a slope.) 
234,"PERI: Oh, here, Doctor, look. "
235,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
236,(Peri has found a stone carving or plaque in the slope they've just
237,come down.) 
238,DOCTOR: The remains of a building. 
239,PERI: And we're not going inside. 
240,"DOCTOR: Of course not, we can't. We haven't found the entrance yet."
241,This is the type of place where some early life forms might have
242,survived. Come along. 
243,PERI: I'm just not crazy about meeting any early life forms. 
244,DOCTOR: Hmm. Yeah. 
245,(Dibber and Glitz put their weapons away.) 
246,"DIBBER: Well, if we've got competition, going to the village could be a"
247,valuable waste of time. 
248,"GLITZ: That complex down there is still functional, which means the L3"
249,robot is operational. 
250,DIBBER: I understand. 
251,"GLITZ: To render the robot non-operational, we have to destroy the"
252,light converter which supplies its energy system. 
253,DIBBER: I know all that. 
254,GLITZ: Then why are you arguing with me? It's not my fault if a bunch
255,of backward savages have turned a Magnum Mark Seven light converter
256,into a totem pole. 
257,DIBBER: It's just that I think we should kill those two first. 
258,GLITZ: And meet the robot head on at full power? I don't think you have
259,"my full interests at heart, Dibber. "
260,DIBBER: If the robot doesn't kill them before we destroy his energy
261,"supply, well, they could be up and away with the goods before we've"
262,even got back from the village. 
263,"GLITZ: I know that, Dibber. Now you understand why I hate competition."
264,It spoils everything. 
265,DIBBER: I still think we should kill them. 
266,"GLITZ: We will, Dibber, we will. When the time is right. "
267,"(Down at the structure, the Doctor is studying the remains.) "
268,"PERI: Doctor, I know this sounds crazy, but I have the weirdest feeling"
269,that I've been here before. 
270,"DOCTOR: Yes, I often get that feeling. Of course, I usually have. In"
271,"your case, it's not possible. "
272,"PERI: Well, possible or not, I want to get away from here. "
273,DOCTOR: You're absolutely right. We must find out what's going on here.
274,
275, PERI: This place is spooky. It's like an overgrown
276,fallout shelter. 
277,DOCTOR: Hmm. You're partly right. This must have been their last
278,desperate attempt to escape the coming fireball. 
279,"PERI: Well, who lived on this planet? "
280,DOCTOR: Now that's something of a mystery. There's strangely little
281,about Ravalox in the records of Gallifrey. Obviously they were a fairly
282,advanced species. Look. 
283,(The Doctor pulls aside vegetation to reveal the plaque. Then he finds
284,a tunnel entrance.) 
285," DOCTOR: Ah ha! That's it. You know, you can"
286,deduce an awful lot about a civilisation from its art. 
287,PERI: What? 
288,"DOCTOR: You know, I might stay here a couple of years and write a"
289,thesis about that. Come along. 
290,(The Doctor goes into the tunnel. Peri looks around.) 
291,DOCTOR : Peri?
292,
293,[Tunnel]
294,
295, PERI: I've scratched myself.
296,
297, [Underground station]
298,
299, (They go down what looks like a very short
300,escalator to an area with cables along the wall.) 
301,"DOCTOR: Oh, you're young. You'll soon heal. "
302,PERI: Thanks for the sympathy. 
303,"DOCTOR: You know, I'm glad I decided to come here. I might stay here"
304,for a year or so and write a thesis. Ancient Life on Ravalox by Doctor 
305,"PERI: Doctor, look! There's something here I think you should see. "
306,"(As they explore, they are being watched.)"
307,
308, [Ravalox]
309,
310,  GLITZ: I heard it. 
311,DIBBER: Over here. 
312, (Dibber and Glitz hide behind a large gnarled tree as
313,a line of people walk along in the distance.) 
314,"GLITZ: Look at them, primitive screeves. "
315,DIBBER: Are they from the village? 
316,GLITZ: Must be. 
317,"DIBBER: Well then, let's make it a few less we'll have to deal with. "
318,GLITZ: No. All we need is a gesture of strength. Show them they haven't
319,got a chance. 
320,(Glitz throws a flash-bang at the people.) 
321,GLITZ: Amazing the affect a loud bang can have on the primitive mind. 
322,(They walk towards the natives.) 
323,"GLITZ: Come here, you ignorant, maggot ridden peasant. Somehow I always"
324,feel foolish saying this. Take me to your leader.
325,
326, [Underground station]
327,
328, (There is a metal sign fallen on the floor of the
329,curved tunnel.) 
330,"DOCTOR: Well, I suppose there is a billion to one chance there was a"
331,place called Marble Arch on Ravalox. 
332,PERI: And they wrote in English? 
333,"DOCTOR: Well, that's another billion to one chance. It does begin to"
334,"seem a little unlikely, doesn't it? "
335,"PERI: Oh, Doctor, we're on Earth aren't we? I said it felt like Earth. "
336,DOCTOR: It's in the wrong part of space for it to be your planet.
337,"Besides, according to all the record books, this is Ravalox. "
338,"PERI: Well then, how do you explain this? "
339,"DOCTOR: Well, they. I can't. Not yet. Unless of course, perhaps they"
340,collected railway stations. 
341,PERI: That's ridiculous. 
342,"DOCTOR: But not impossible, though. Not as impossible as the other"
343,explanation. 
344,PERI: What's that? 
345,"DOCTOR: Well, that somehow or other your planet and its entire"
346,constellation managed to shift itself a couple of light years across
347,"space, after which, for some reason, it became known as Ravalox. "
348,"PERI: Well, what time are we in? "
349,"DOCTOR: Oh, a long time after your period. "
350,(He checks his pocket watch.) 
351,"DOCTOR: Er, two billion years or more. "
352,PERI: So what happened to London? 
353,"DOCTOR: Wiped out, if this was London. "
354,"PERI: Doctor, I know it is. I can feel it. "
355,"DOCTOR: Now, don't get emotional. "
356,PERI: Don't get emotional. This cinder we're standing on is all that's
357,left of my world. Everything I knew.
358,
359, [Trial room]
360,
361, DOCTOR: Why do I have to sit here watching Peri
362,"getting upset, while two unsavoury adventurers bully a bunch of"
363,natives. 
364,"VALEYARD: The reason will be made clear shortly, Doctor. "
365,"DOCTOR: As a matter of interest, where is Peri? "
366,VALEYARD: Where you left her. 
367,DOCTOR: Where's that? 
368,VALEYARD: You don't remember? Obviously a side effect of being taken
369,out of time. The amnesia should soon pass. 
370,INQUISITOR: Shall we continue? 
371,"DOCTOR: Well, can't we just have the edited highlights?"
372,
373,[Underground station]
374,
375, DOCTOR: I know how you feel. 
376,PERI: Do you? 
377,DOCTOR: Of course I do. You've been travelling with me long enough to
378,know that none of this really matters. Not to you. Your world is safe. 
379,"PERI: This is still my world, whatever the period, and I care about it."
380,And all you do is talk about it as though we're in a planetarium. 
381,"DOCTOR: I'm sorry. But look at it this way. Planets come and go, stars"
382,"perish. Matter disperses, coalesces, reforms into other patterns, other"
383,worlds. Nothing can be eternal. 
384,"PERI: I know what you mean, and I still want to get away from here. "
385,"DOCTOR: Oh, I can't. There's a mystery here. Questions to which I must"
386,"have an answer. Look, Peri. Peri. "
387,(They go over to a door which was never at the original Marble Arch
388,station. It slides open.) 
389,"DOCTOR: Oh, hermetically sealed, leading down to a lower level. Now,"
390,some of the original inhabitants might have survived down there. You
391,coming? 
392,PERI: No. I've seen enough. I'll wait you at the entrance. Where they
393,used to sell candy bars and newspapers. 
394,"DOCTOR: All right, shan't be long. Don't go wandering off. Be careful. "
395,"(The Doctor leaves with the torch, and Peri stumbles on some rubble.) "
396,PERI: Ow. 
397,(The Doctor returns.) 
398,DOCTOR: I said be careful. 
399,(The Doctor leaves again.) 
400,PERI: Of what? The spooks and ghosts you're always telling me don't
401,"exist. Hey! You could have left me the umbrella! Oh, please yourself. I"
402,don't mind getting wet. 
403,"(Peri goes back along the platform, straight into the arms of two men"
404,carrying spears. She screams.)
405,
406, [Village]
407,
408," (Simple wood and thatch buildings, and wattle"
409,fences. An incongruous metal pillar stands nearby. ) 
410,GLITZ: The light converter. 
411,"DIBBER: Let me blast it, Mister Glitz, then we can get away from here. "
412,"GLITZ: Oh, you'd look good with a back full of spears, Dibber. Use your"
413,head. 
414,"(They are escorted towards the largest hut. A mature, well built woman"
415,strides out to meet them. Everyone say Hi! to the redoubtable Joan Sims.) 
416,"GLITZ: Anyway, we've got company. Right royal company, by the looks of"
417,things. 
418,DIBBER: You'll never charm her. 
419,"GLITZ: I have an uncanny knack with aging females, Dibber. One look"
420,into my eyes and they start to melt.
421,
422,[Marb Station]
423,
424,(The Doctor strolls through well-lit metal tunnels
425,into a large metal lined chamber. Up steep flights of stairs are closed
426,three cubicles. By the steps are glass flasks on pedestals. The Doctor
427,picks one up to sniff its contents.) 
428,COMPUTER: Water thief. Water thief. Protect your water. 
429,(The cubicle doors slide down and two men in yellow coveralls and grey
430,hoods rush out from them brandishing wooden clubs.) 
431,DOCTOR: Perhaps you could direct me to the stationmaster's house? Now
432,"please, gentlemen. "
433,(The Doctor is surrounded by raised clubs.)
434,
435, [Drathro's 'castle']
436,
437, (A man in black appears on a screen.) 
438,"MERDEEN [on screen]: Yes, Immortal? "
439,(A non-human voice answers him. We do not see the speaker.) 
440,DRATHRO: Marb station shows one work unit over strength. Remove it! 
441,"MERDEEN: Immediately, Immortal. "
442,(Merdeen leaves and the screen goes blank. We now see that the speaker
443,was a robot with a head like a radar scanner.)
444,
445, [Control room]
446,
447,(Merdeen turns to a man in a crash helmet working a
448,computer terminal.) 
449,MERDEEN: Call the Watch. Marb is a work unit over. 
450,GRELL: How? 
451,"MERDEEN: I don't know, but the Immortal is never wrong, Grell. "
452,GRELL: I'll summon the watch.
453,
454, [Village]
455,
456, (The Matriarch is settled in her throne by her
457,hut.) 
458,"KATRYCA: So, you are outlanders. From where? "
459,"GLITZ: A far off star, majesty. "
460,KATRYCA: You have a spaceship? 
461,GLITZ: You know of such things? 
462,"KATRYCA: It is recorded in our folk memory. Before the fire, our"
463,ancestors travelled among the stars. 
464,GLITZ: Is that a fact? 
465,"KATRYCA: It is also recorded that such travel angered the gods, who"
466,punished us by sending the great fire which destroyed our planet. 
467,"GLITZ: No, dear lady. It was much more secular than that. That"
468,attracted the fireball. 
469,KATRYCA: That is our great totem to the Earth God Haldren. 
470,"GLITZ: No, madam. That is a malfunctioning navigational beacon. It was"
471,"that that attracted the fireball five hundred years ago, and I'm here"
472,to tell you that it is still malfunctioning today. 
473,KATRYCA: How do you know this? 
474,"GLITZ: It is my job to know. And if you don't have it dismantled, the"
475,fireball will return. 
476,KATRYCA: What is your name? 
477,GLITZ: Sabalom Glitz. 
478,"KATRYCA: I am an old woman, Sabalom Glitz. You are not the first to"
479,visit my village from another world. 
480,GLITZ: Is that a fact? 
481,"KATRYCA: On each and every occasion, they have all wanted to dismantle"
482,the great totem. 
483,"GLITZ: In that case, you understand the urgency "
484,"KATRYCA: And on each and every occasion, they have all had a different"
485,reason. 
486,"GLITZ: Let me assure you, my credentials are bona fide and completely"
487,in order. 
488,(Glitz draws his gun. He is swiftly disarmed by a large man with a
489,large head of brown hair. Men hold Dibber and Glitz by the arms.) 
490,"KATRYCA: Ah yes, The guns. They all had similar credentials. "
491,GLITZ: That totem is a navigational hazard. It must be dismantled. 
492,KATRYCA: You must think me a fool! You have come here for no other
493,reason but to steal the symbol of our great god. 
494,GLITZ: And what would I want with some earth grubbing deity. 
495,"KATRYCA: I don't know. But before you die, I shall certainly find out."
496,
497, [Marb Station]
498,
499, (The Doctor is unconscious and fastened to a
500,pillar with chains. He wakes.) 
501,"BALAZAR: Where are you from, Old One? "
502,DOCTOR: Old One? 
503,"BALAZAR: What station did you disgrace with your miserable presence,"
504,water thief? 
505,"DOCTOR: I may look old to you, whiskerless youth, but I'll have you"
506,know I'm in the prime of my life. I'm only nine hundred years old. Now
507,untie me at once. 
508,BALAZAR: You'll be untied as soon as we're ready for the stoning. 
509,DOCTOR: Stoning? Is this the way you welcome visitors? 
510,BALAZAR: Water is life. Those who steal life must in their turn die.
511,The Immortal commands it. 
512,"DOCTOR: Oh, the Immortal. Who might that be? "
513,"BALAZAR: Come now, Old One. Feigning ignorance of the Immortal will not"
514,save you from death.
515,
516, [Village]
517,
518, (Katryca hefts Glitz's gun.) 
519,"KATRYCA: This is what I've been waiting for. Now, Immortal, I am ready"
520,for you.
521,
522, [Marb Station]
523,
524,BALAZAR: We shall soon be ready. 
525,"DOCTOR: Oh, goody. Just who are you? "
526,"BALAZAR: I am Balazar, the reader of the books. "
527,DOCTOR: Oh. And what books are those? 
528,"BALAZAR: Ancient books, from the world before the fire. They contain"
529,"much wisdom for those who can interpret their meaning. Here in Marb, we"
530,have three. 
531,DOCTOR: Three? Splendid. What are they called? 
532,BALAZAR: The Books of Knowledge. 
533,"DOCTOR: No, but each book must have a name, Balazar. It's usually"
534,written on the front. 
535,BALAZAR: One of our books is called Mo By Dick by Herman Melville. It
536,"tells of a great white water god, and contains many mystical passages. "
537,"DOCTOR: Yes, I've read it. What are the other books? "
538,"BALAZAR: How can you have read it, Old One? The sacred books belong to"
539,Marb. 
540,DOCTOR: Will you stop calling me Old One? I am known as the Doctor.
541,What else do you read? 
542,"BALAZAR: The Water Babies by Charles Kingsley, which tells of life long"
543,before the fire. 
544,DOCTOR: Sounds a rum sort of library to me. What's your third book? 
545,BALAZAR: Most mysterious of all the sacred texts. UK Habitats of the
546,Canadian Goose by HM Stationery Office. 
547,DOCTOR: Hmm. What do you call this place? 
548,BALAZAR: Marb Station. 
549,"DOCTOR: No, I mean your whole world, everything. "
550,BALAZAR: We call it UK Habitat. Ah. It appears we're ready for
551,"the stoning now, Doctor. I have greatly enjoyed our felicitous"
552,"discourse, but alas, the end is nigh. "
553,"DOCTOR: You said you'd unchain me, Balazar. "
554,BALAZAR: It is not advisable. I have taken an affection to you. It is
555,best to die quickly. 
556,DOCTOR: Allow me to be the judge of that. Unchain me at once.
557,
558, [Hut] 
559, (Dibber watches through the planks in the door as
560,Peri is brought into the village.) 
561,DIBBER: They've got that woman we saw earlier. 
562,"GLITZ: I can't understand it, Dibber. They're savages. "
563,"DIBBER: Well, don't let it get you down. "
564,GLITZ: What went wrong? That old hag took our guns away from us just
565,like that. How can we be their prisoners? 
566,DIBBER: I told you it was risky coming here. 
567,"GLITZ: Yes, well, now you know what I mean about competition. It gets"
568,you nowhere. 
569,"DIBBER: I told you we should have blasted them, Mister Glitz. "
570,"GLITZ: Yes, Dibber, you've made your point. It's a pity you"
571,didn't anticipate they'd jump us with such ease. 
572,"DIBBER: I did, but I didn't think you'd listen. "
573,
574, [Marb Station]
575,
576, (The Doctor has been unchained. The rest of the
577,men are holding large stones in their hands.) 
578,BALAZAR: I think it best that you stand over here. 
579,"DOCTOR: Oh, why? "
580,BALAZAR: Well in case some stray stone breaks the water jugs. 
581,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. "
582,BALAZAR: People get very excited at these stonings. 
583,(Balazar gives the Doctor his umbrella and walks away.) 
584,DOCTOR: I'm not excited. 
585,BALAZAR: Ready? 
586,DOCTOR: Yes. 
587,BALAZAR: Get set. Go! 
588,(The Doctor unfurls his umbrella but still gets hit by one stone. He
589,falls and the men cheer.)
590,
591,[Trial room]
592,
593, DOCTOR: Oh! Why'd you stop it at the best bit? I
594,was rather enjoying that. 
595,VALEYARD: I'm sure you were. 
596,"DOCTOR: Clever, eh? That trick with the umbrella. "
597,"VALEYARD: Most ingenious, my dear Doctor. "
598,"DOCTOR: Oh, I always like to do the unexpected. Takes people by"
599,surprise. 
600,VALEYARD: Hear how the Doctor takes pride in his interference. Hear how
601,he boasts. This is not the reaction of a responsible Time Lord. 
602,"INQUISITOR: We are all aware of that, Valeyard. What is the point you"
603,are trying to make? 
604,VALEYARD: These proceedings started as a mere enquiry into the Doctor's
605,activities. I'm suggesting now that it becomes a trial. And if he is
606,"found guilty, I strongly suggest the termination of his life! "
607, Part Two
608,
609, [Trial room]
610,
611," DOCTOR: So, you want me dead, eh? "
612,"INQUISITOR: What the Valeyard wants and what the court decides, are two"
613,"entirely different things, Doctor. "
614,"DOCTOR: Thank you, my lady. "
615,INQUISITOR: Proceed Valeyard.
616,
617, [Marb station]
618,
619, (The stoning crowd is cheering.) 
620,BALAZAR: Train guards! 
621,(A small vehicle arrives towing a unit that can seat six. Merdeen and
622,three guards are on it.) 
623,COMPUTER: This station is a work unit over committed strength. There
624,must be a cull. 
625,BALAZAR: It has been dealt with. 
626,"MERDEEN: See that he is dead, Grell. Where is he from? "
627,"BALAZAR: I don't know. He told many lies, even that he had read our"
628,sacred books. 
629,GRELL: He still breathes. 
630,MERDEEN: Then kill him.
631,
632, [Drathro's 'castle']
633,
634, DRATHRO: Stop!
635,
636, [Marb station]
637,
638,(Only Merdeen can hear the robot through his helmet
639,radio.) 
640,"MERDEEN: Wait, the Immortal speaks. He now wishes to question the"
641,stranger. How near death is he? 
642,GRELL: Merely stunned. 
643,"MERDEEN: Pick him up. Grell, patrol. "
644,GRELL: Why not transport him on the train? 
645,"MERDEEN: I said patrol. (to Balazar) You, come with me. "
646,"BALAZAR: I, sir? "
647,"MERDEEN: You have spoken with the stranger. If he dies, the Immortal"
648,"may wish to question you about him. (Merdeen and Balazar leave,"
649,followed by two guards carrying the Doctor.)

651, [Katryca's hut]
652,
653, (Peri is brought in and dropped in front of
654,Katryca's throne.) 
655,PERI: Oh! 
656,"KATRYCA: Welcome, girl. "
657,PERI: Hi. 
658,KATRYCA: Rise. You are not from the place of the underground. Where are
659,you from? 
660,"PERI: Well, it's kind of difficult to explain. "
661,"KATRYCA: My name is Katryca, I am the leader of the Free. Do you have a"
662,"name, girl? "
663,"PERI: Perpugilliam Brown, but my friends call me Peri. "
664,"KATRYCA: Peri. Not many girls join the Free, Peri. I shall provide some"
665,excellent husbands for you. 
666,PERI: Husbands? Plural? 
667,KATRYCA: Such women as we have must be shared. Think about it. Put her
668,with the other prisoners. Keep them guarded. 
669,"PERI: All right, all right. I can walk."
670,
671, [Subway]
672,
673," BALAZAR: Tell me, Merdeen, you served the"
674,Immortal. Is he as men say? 
675,MERDEEN: What do men say? 
676,"BALAZAR: That he is taller than two, with arms of steel. "
677,MERDEEN: The Immortal is never seen. He stays in his castle. 
678,BALAZAR: Then how does he give you his commands? 
679,MERDEEN: He talks to me through the air and he watches me with boxes. 
680,(Merdeen points to a CCTV camera up on the wall.) 
681,"BALAZAR: I think this is called a camera, Merdeen. The men of ancient"
682,times used such things to make pictures of the Canadian goose. 
683,"MERDEEN: How do you know that, Balazar? "
684,BALAZAR: It is my task to study the ancient texts. 
685,DOCTOR: About which you continually boast. That's the trouble with
686,"pallid little swats like you, Balazar, You can't even organise an"
687,efficient stoning. 
688,BALAZAR: It was only half over. 
689,DOCTOR: Oh. 
690,BALAZAR: You'd have been free of your troubles now if Merdeen and his
691,train guards had not saved you. 
692,"DOCTOR: Then I'm grateful to you, Merdeen. "
693,MERDEEN: It was on the orders of the Immortal. 
694,"DOCTOR: Oh. Well, please convey my thanks to him. Is that water? Could"
695,I have some? 
696,MERDEEN: It's my ration for the next two days.
697,
698, [Drathro's 'castle']
699,
700, DRATHRO: Give it to him. 
701,MERDEEN [on screen]: What? 
702,DRATHRO: Give it to him. 
703,"MERDEEN: Oh. Yes, of course. "
704,"DOCTOR: No, of course not. I'd forgotten how important that stuff was"
705,down here. 
706,(The Doctor goes up to the camera.) 
707,"DOCTOR: Mono-optic system, eh? Very interesting. And is the, er,"
708,Immortal on the other end of that? 
709,(The screen goes blank. A pair of pallid blond men look at each other.)
710,
711,TANDRELL: Extremely ugly. 
712,HUMKER: Hideous in the extreme. 
713,DRATHRO: Physiognomy is irrelevant. 
714,TANDRELL: In so far as 
715,HUMKER: Appearance has no function. 
716,TANDRELL: But function has an appearance. 
717,HUMKER: Which is irrelevant to the function. 
718,TANDRELL: Perfect. 
719,HUMKER: I must write that down. 
720,TANDRELL: I will make an equation of it. 
721,DRATHRO: Cease your prattle. 
722,"HUMKER: Of course, sir. "
723,"TANDRELL: At once, sir. "
724,DRATHRO: Activate the service robot. Now!
725,
726, [Hut]
727,
728,(Peri is pushed inside.) 
729,"GLITZ: Ah, it seems we have a pretty visitor. I'm beginning to feel"
730,"better already. Sabalom Glitz, my dear, and this youth with the vacuous"
731,expression and single track mind is Dibber. 
732,PERI: Peri. 
733,GLITZ: Ah. 
734,(They shake hands.) 
735,"PERI: Well, obviously you're not from round here. "
736,"GLITZ: Merely visiting, like good yourself. "
737,"PERI: Well, I hope my visit's very short. That doesn't look like it's"
738,from round here either. 
739,GLITZ: It's a light converter. 
740,PERI: A what? 
741,DIBBER: It funnels black light energy down to the L3. That's why we
742,have to knock it out. 
743,GLITZ: Dibber! I'm sure Peri isn't interested in professional matters. 
744,"DIBBER: Oh, you're right, Mister Glitz, yeah. "
745,"GLITZ: When we first saw you, Peri, you were not alone. "
746,"DIBBER: That's right, you were with a dilly in a long coat. But he"
747,disappeared down the tunnel before we 
748,"GLITZ: Before we could leap forward and make your acquaintance, eh,"
749,Dibber? 
750,"DIBBER: Yeah, that's it. "
751,GLITZ: Where is your friend now? 
752,"PERI: The Doctor? Oh, he's probably still down there. For a Time Lord,"
753,he's not very good at keeping time. 
754,GLITZ: The Doctor is a Time Lord? So that's how he knew where to go. 
755,PERI: What do you mean? 
756,"DIBBER: Sent him, did they? "
757,PERI: Who? 
758,"GLITZ: The Time Lords, my dear. As my friend says, he must be acting on"
759,their behalf. 
760,PERI: I don't think the Doctor's acting on anyone's behalf. 
761,"GLITZ: So, he's a freelance like myself. Possibly we can reach an"
762,"accommodation here, my boy. Two rogues with but a single thought."
763,
764, [Subway]
765,
766, DOCTOR: And how long has the Immortal lived in his
767,"so-called, castle? "
768,MERDEEN: Since the fire. 
769,"DOCTOR: Oh, five hundred years? "
770,"BALAZAR: I do not know, Doctor. He was sent to save our lives many"
771,centuries ago. 
772,DOCTOR: Hmm. And he never goes out and nobody ever comes in? 
773,BALAZAR: Only the young men who pass the selection. 
774,DOCTOR: What selection? 
775,BALAZAR: To find the two cleverest youths. They go to the castle. 
776,DOCTOR: Why? 
777,BALAZAR: It is said the Immortal eats them. 
778,"DOCTOR: Never believe what is said, Balazar, only what you know."
779,
780, [Drathro's 'castle']
781,
782, (A very functional non-humanoid robot is released
783,into Marb station.) 
784,HUMKER: Why are we doing this? 
785,TANDRELL: Because sir ordered it. 
786,"HUMKER: Yes, but "
787,DRATHRO: It may be needed.
788,
789, [Hut]
790,
791, DIBBER: These bars remind me of home. I reckon I
792,could bite me way through them. 
793,GLITZ: Relax Dibber. I'll find a way to win the confidence of these
794,simple peasants. 
795,"PERI: Well, I'll like to get out of here. Katryca said something about"
796,choosing husbands for me. 
797,GLITZ: There you are. Obviously she's a romantic at heart. 
798,"PERI: Well, so am I, but not romantic enough to want more that one"
799,husband. 
800,"DIBBER: Where we come from, a woman can have as many as six. "
801,"PERI: Oh, it's very similar on my planet, except we usually have them"
802,one at a time. 
803,GLITZ: I should like to stand in paterfamilias for your absent father
804,"and give you away, my dear, but I always cry at these moments of deep"
805,sentiment. 
806,DIBBER: I think we should help her get out. 
807,"GLITZ: No, no, dear boy. We may need these brutish primitives. "
808,PERI: What for? 
809,(Glitz unfolds a map.) 
810,"GLITZ: This shows a layout of the tunnel system, all hermetically"
811,sealed. If we can persuade Katryca's people to drive a shaft into the
812,"centre, we can fill them with gas. "
813,PERI: You'd kill them? The people Katryca calls underground dwellers?
814,That would be mass murder. 
815,"GLITZ: I'm sure my conscience will prick a little, but where money is"
816,"concerned, that doesn't usually last long. "
817,"PERI: Oh, you can't do it. "
818,"GLITZ: I think it will be pretty simple. Don't forget, this is a high"
819,"risk business venture, Peri. The people down there take the risk, I"
820,take the profit. 
821,DIBBER: That still leaves the L3. 
822,GLITZ: And what chance would the robot will have without a labour
823,force? It'll probably be quicker than trying to destroy its black light
824,supply. 
825,(The big man enters.) 
826,BROKEN TOOTH: Come with me.
827,
828, [Subway] 
829, (Merdeen stops at a metal door next to some steps
830,very like those on the space station where the Tardis landed.) 
831,"MERDEEN: You enter here, Doctor. "
832,"DOCTOR: Ah. No need to knock, I imagine. "
833,BALAZAR: Will I be needed? 
834,MERDEEN: No. 
835,DOCTOR: Lucky old you. 
836,MERDEEN: When you are in the Immortal's presence you will cast your
837,eyes to the ground. 
838,DOCTOR: Will I? 
839,MERDEEN: It is forbidden to look upon him. 
840,"DOCTOR: On pain of being turned into a pillar of salt, I imagine. That"
841,sort of thing? 
842,MERDEEN: You will not find it wise to mock the Immortal. Doubtless your
843,body will be returned to me before this day is out. 
844,"DOCTOR: Oh, Merdeen, why don't you just push off and guard some trains,"
845,eh? 
846,(The Doctor pushes open the double doors and looks through carefully
847,"before entering and closing them behind him. Merdeen, Balazar and the"
848,"guards leave, then the service robot comes out of an alcove.)"
849,
850, [Katryca's hut]
851,
852," GLITZ: Ah, dear lady. I knew once you'd had time"
853,to consider 
854,"KATRYCA: Be silent, fat one. I have studied the fires and there is"
855,anger in them. 
856,PERI: Anger? 
857,"KATRYCA: You have travelled from beyond the stars. Your intention, to"
858,steal our great totem. Only a sacrifice in the flames will propitiate
859,the gods. 
860,DIBBER: All of us? 
861,"KATRYCA: No. Only you are the chosen one, Sabalom Glitz. "
862,GLITZ: Me? Are you insane? I'm wanted in six different galaxies for
863,crimes you couldn't even imagine. Do you think an old hag like you can
864,bring me down? 
865,KATRYCA: The pyre is being built. You will be brought when your time is
866,due.
867,
868, [Outside Drathro's 'castle']

871,opposite the entrance.) 
872,"DOCTOR: Er, this is my best side."
873,
874, [Drathro's 'castle']
875,
876, HUMKER: The arrogance. 
877,TANDRELL: Can't wait to see how he's been programmed. 
878,(The Doctor pushes open the double doors and enters.) 
879,DRATHRO: I have been waiting for this day. Welcome at last. 
880,DOCTOR: You were expecting me? 
881,"DRATHRO: For centuries. I am Drathro, an L3 robot. "
882,(Humker and Tandrell take various items from the Doctor's pockets.) 
883,"DOCTOR: Then I fear you are under a slight misapprehension, Drathro. I"
884,only decided to come here yesterday. 
885,DRATHRO: You are not from Andromeda? Then where are you from? 
886,"DOCTOR: Gallifrey, originally, though I travel round a lot. "
887,DRATHRO: I have heard of Gallifrey. An advanced civilisation. 
888,DOCTOR: In some ways. 
889,DRATHRO: I apologize for my error. 
890,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's all right. Even Immortals make the odd mistake every"
891,few millennia. 
892,(The Doctor snatches back his little teddy bear and bag of jelly
893,babies.) 
894,DRATHRO: I am not immortal. 
895,"DOCTOR: Oh. Well, the locals round here seem to think you are. "
896,"DRATHRO: These are my assistants, Tandrell and Humker. You will work"
897,with them. 
898,(The Doctor offers the men a jelly baby.) 
899,DOCTOR: Will I? Why? 
900,DRATHRO: Because I command it. 
901,DOCTOR: Oh. And you are obviously a robot used to getting your own way.
902,
903,"HUMKER: This is remarkable, Drathro. "
904,TANDRELL: Most impressive. 
905,HUMKER: Even the texture has an organic warmth. 
906,"DOCTOR; Do stop prodding me, there's a good fellow. "
907,DRATHRO: The Doctor is not a robot. He is an organic from an advanced
908,civilisation. 
909,TANDRELL: An organic? 
910,HUMKER: We've not met an organic since we passed the selection. 
911,DOCTOR: Ah. I knew you two hadn't ended up for lunch. 
912,TANDRELL: Explain. 
913,DOCTOR: Never mind. What is this work you want me to do?
914,
915, [Trial room]

917," INQUISITOR: Is this relevant testimony, Valeyard?"
918,We seem to be straying from the point. 
919,"VALEYARD: Circumstantially germane, my lady, in that it is part of the"
920,prosecution's case is that the Doctor introduces a disruptive and
921,corrupting influence wherever he goes. 
922,DOCTOR: Sheer poppycock. 
923,"VALEYARD: If the Doctor had not visited Ravalox, then the whole chain"
924,of events we are witnessing would not have been set in motion. 
925,"DOCTOR: Well, how can the Boatyard make that claim? What might or might"
926,not have happened is entirely speculative. 
927,"INQUISITOR: That is for me to decide, Doctor. And may I remind you, the"
928,charge you face is grave indeed. 
929,"DOCTOR: Oh, I only have to look at the Graveyard to see that, ma'am. "

936,DOCTOR: Hmm? Give me a chance. I've only just started. 
937,DRATHRO: The black light system is indicating incipient failure. 
938,"DOCTOR: Yeah, I can see that, but they don't last forever, you know. "
939,DRATHRO: I am trained only in installation and maintenance. 
940,"DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, yeah, and very useful too. That's where the money is. "
941,"DRATHRO: I have trained these humans to study the problem, but they"
942,make no progress. 
943,"DOCTOR: Well, black light is very tricky stuff, Drathro. "
944,DRATHRO: I have a learning capacity but my processors of ratiocination
945,are logical. Organics often eliminate such steps. 
946,DOCTOR: It's called intuition. 
947,DRATHRO: Your first task will be to restructure the system. 
948,"DOCTOR: Well, just a minute. Black light is not my field. "

957,"DOCTOR: I am charged with interfering, yet it's blatantly obvious to a"
958,blind speelsnape that I am working under duress. 
959,INQUISITOR: That does seem a valid point. What is the relevance of your
960,presentation? 
961,"VALEYARD: If the accused hadn't interrupted, my lady, the point I wish"
962,to make would have become obvious.

993,HUMKER: It was also to maintain the three Sleepers until they could be
994,returned to Andromeda. 
995,DOCTOR: The three Sleepers? 
996,DRATHRO: They are dead now. The relief ships failed to arrive. 
997,"DOCTOR: I see. Well, if this power failure's allowed to get any worse,"
998,we'll all be dead soon.

1006,hands.)

1010,"DOCTOR: But it was raining buckets outside, or it was when I arrived. "
1011,DRATHRO: I am aware that precipitation has returned to normal.

1395,DIBBER: That's why the lost expedition missed. 
1396,DOCTOR: What lost expedition? 
1397,DIBBER: Andromeda bunged off these robots in a relief ship

1883,charges. 
1884,INQUISITOR: You will have the opportunity in due course to rebut any or
1885,all of the Valeyard's charges. 
1886,"DOCTOR: Oh, the Valeyard's charges. I always thought Valeyard meant"
1887,learned court prosecutor. 
1888,VALEYARD: And so it does. 
1889,"DOCTOR: Not in your case, sir. Your points of law are spurious, your"
1890,"evidence weak, verging on the irrelevant, and your reasoning quite"
1891,"unsound. In fact, your point of view belongs in quite another place."
1892,Perhaps the mantle of Valeyard was a mistake. I would therefore suggest
1893,that you change it for the garment of quite another sort of yard. That
1894,of the
1895,"knackers' yard. For your argument is as tired and warn out as the poor,"
1896,unfortunate creatures that end up there. 
1897,INQUISITOR: You will apologise at once! 
1898,DOCTOR: For telling the truth? Never! 
1899,VALEYARD: The Doctor is well known for these childish outbursts. I do
1900,not find the ramblings of an immature mind offensive. 
1901,DOCTOR: Immature? 
1902,VALEYARD: It is that particular state of mind that has made it
1903,necessary for you to be brought before this court. 
1904,DOCTOR: Immature? I was on Ravalox trying to avert a catastrophe. The
1905,deaths of several hundred innocent people! Surely not even in the eyes
1906,of Time Lords can that be deemed either immature or a crime. 
1907,"VALEYARD: The crime was in being there, Doctor! Your immaturity was in"
1908,not realising you had broken a cardinal law of the Time Lords. Your
1909,presence initiated the whole chain of events that we have witnessed. 
1910,"INQUISITOR: Thank you, Valeyard. It was that point about the relevance"
1911,of the testimony that I had intended to raise. 
1912,"VALEYARD: My pleasure, Inquisitor. "
1913,"DOCTOR: Oh, this is ridiculous. Drathro's black light system"
1914,was in a state of terminal decay before I even arrived on that planet. 
1915,"VALEYARD: That is not in question. However, but for your intervention,"
1916,"the two technological trainees, Humker and Tandrell, might have"
1917,repaired the defect.

2234,"DIBBER: Oh, the black light. Yeah, we've got so much of that sometimes"
2235,we can hardly see. 
2236,DRATHRO: There is black light on your ship? 
2237,"GLITZ: As my friend says. So, what I suggest we do is you come with us"
2238,"and we'll fix you up, eh? "
2239,DRATHRO: Why? 
2240,"GLITZ: Well, I hate to see a good looking robot like you go to waste."
2241,I'll tell you what else we can do for you. We can drop you back in the
2242,constellation of Andromeda. How about that? 
2243,DRATHRO: It is possible? 
2244,"GLITZ: And, oh, the secrets. Of course, you must bring them. I mean,"
2245,they'll expect you to bring them. 
2246,DRATHRO: How far from here is your ship? 
2247,"GLITZ: Oh, right outside, really. No distance at all. "
2248,DRATHRO: I could function for a short distance. 
2249,GLITZ: Of course you could. 
2250,DRATHRO: Then I accept your offer. Take that. Tie these others up. I
2251,will fetch the secrets. 
2252,"GLITZ: You two, over there. "
2253,DOCTOR: Well done! 
2254,"DIBBER: Sorry, Doc. You heard what he said. "
2255,DOCTOR: Don't be a fool! 
2256,(Drathro takes one box from an array of them on the wall as Glitz ties
2257,up the Doctor. Dibber ties up Merdeen and Peri.) 
2258,"GLITZ: Slip-knot, Doctor. The best I can do for you. "
2259,DOCTOR: Strange how low cunning succeeds where intelligent reasoning
2260,fails. 
2261,"GLITZ: Don't knock low cunning, Doctor. You're still here, aren't you?"
2262,"Oh, that's it is it? The secrets. My word, there should be a lot there."
2263,"All microdots, no doubt. Come along then, Dibber. Open the door for the"
2264,Immortal. 
2265,"(Glitz, Dibber and Drathro leave. The Doctor quickly frees himself then"
2266,cuts Merdeen and Peri free.) 
2267,"DOCTOR: Quickly, you've got to help me. It's a three stage cut-out."
2268,We've got to try and shut the machine down. 
2269,PERI: Will that prevent an explosion? 
2270,"DOCTOR: All I can do now is hope to contain it. Peri, press that row of"
2271,buttons in front of you. 
2272,PERI: Which ones? 
2273,"DOCTOR: All of them! Merdeen, flick up all the switches with red neons"
2274,on them. 
2275,MERDEEN: Neons? 
2276,"DOCTOR: Oh, show him, Peri. "
2277,PERI: Those. How much time do have we got? 
2278,"DOCTOR: Not long. Oh, these levers haven't been moved in centuries. "
2279,(The Doctor pushes down the first of the reluctant plungers.) 
2280,PERI: Now what? 
2281,"DOCTOR: Get out of here, the pair of you. "
2282,PERI: What about you? 
2283,"DOCTOR: Get out! Merdeen, take her. "
2284,(The second plunger finally goes down. The third is irrevocable stuck.
2285,The Doctor heads for the door.) 
2286,DOCTOR: I did my best. I only hope it's enough. 
2287,(The Doctor flees down the corridor. Behind him there is a big KaBOOM!
2288,The shockwave travels out along the subways and knocks Balazar over.)
2289,
2290,[Underground station]
2291,
2292,(Drathro roars.) 
2293,GLITZ: It's blowing up! 
2294,(Glitz and Dibber take cover as Drathro topples forward before glowing
2295,red hot and burning. Dibber investigates while Glitz keeps his fingers
2296,in his ears and his eyes shut.) 
2297,"DIBBER: Er, you're not going to like this, Mister Glitz. "
2298,GLITZ: Is it finished? 
2299,DIBBER: All finished. And the secrets. 
2300,(The box disintegrates in Dibbers hand.) 
2301,GLITZ: Eh? 
2302,"DIBBER: Well, except for this. "
2303,GLITZ: And what's that? 
2304,DIBBER: It's a piece of black light converter aerial. Pure silictone. 
2305,GLITZ: The hardest known metal in the galaxy. 
2306,"DIBBER: And the most expensive. What's more, there's got to be a couple"
2307,of tons of the stuff 
2308,"GLITZ: I'm way ahead of you, my son. You know we could clean up on this"
2309,"job very nicely. What's more, we have a tasty little kitty for the next"
2310,venture. 
2311,(Glitz and Dibber leave. Humker and Tandrell run in.) 
2312,HUMKER: Fresh air. What a wonderful smell. 
2313,"TANDRELL: Do you know, you're right. Absolutely wonderful. "
2314,
2315,HUMKER: That's the first time you've ever agreed with me. 
2316,"TANDRELL: I know. Strange, isn't it."
2317,
2318,[Marb station]
2319,
2320,DOCTOR: And still the lobster held on. You're in a
2321,worse mess than I am. 
2322,BALAZAR: Are Merdeen and Peri safe? 
2323,DOCTOR: You can ask them for yourself. 
2324,MERDEEN: Balazar! 
2325,"PERI: Oh, I wish you wouldn't keep frightening me like this. "
2326,DOCTOR: I told you to get out of here. 
2327,PERI: Please don't start. I'm too tired and too scared to cope. 
2328,DOCTOR: All right. 
2329,"BALAZAR: This seems to be the end, Doctor. As it is written in the"
2330,books. 
2331,"DOCTOR: No, Balazar. For you, this is the beginning. Chapter one,"
2332,"paragraph one, as they say. Take your people up to the surface where"
2333,they belong. 
2334,BALAZAR: Yes. Perhaps at last we shall find the habitat of the Canadian
2335,goose. 
2336,DOCTOR: Perhaps. 
2337,(The Doctor samples the green gloop on Balazar.) 
2338,"DOCTOR: Mmm. I think dinner's on him. Farewell, my loquacious friend."
2339,"Right, let's get back to the Tardis. "
2340,PERI: It's the other way. 
2341,DOCTOR: What is? 
2342,PERI: The Tardis. 
2343,DOCTOR: I know. It's that way. Yes. Farewell. But there are still one
2344,"or two questions that have to be answered, like who moved this planet"
2345,"two light years off its original course, and what was in that box that"
2346,Glitz and Dibber were so interested it? 
2347,"BALAZAR: Goodbye, Old One, and thank you for your help. "
2348,"PERI: Old One. Hey, that's cute. "
2349,DOCTOR: I always knew there was an evil streak in you. Old One indeed.
2350,
2351,[Trial room]
2352,
2353,"DOCTOR: Well, that's one up to me, I think. There"
2354,can't be many people who can literally claim to have saved the entire
2355,"universe. Well, if that's all the muck you can rake up "
2356,"VALEYARD: Sit down. Smugness does not become you, Doctor. "
2357,DOCTOR: That is an irrelevant observation. I think it's now my turn to
2358,prevent the case for the defence. 
2359,INQUISITOR: In due course. 
2360,"DOCTOR: Well, that's not fair. Look, I wish it put on record that my"
2361,involvement in the affairs of that planet resulted in the freedom of
2362,Drathro's underground slaves. 
2363,INQUISITOR: That has been noted. 
2364,"DOCTOR: And despite the fact that evidence has been withheld, my"
2365,presence there was most specifically requested. 
2366,VALEYARD: You showed little reluctance in complying with the request. 
2367,"DOCTOR: Well, lives were at stake. "
2368,"VALEYARD: Lives were lost, and because of your meddling, Doctor. "
2369,"DOCTOR: I deny that. Without my help, an entire civilisation might have"
2370,been wiped out. 
2371,VALEYARD: Without your interference it might have involved less
2372,sacrifice of human life. 
2373,DOCTOR: That was a risk I had to take. 
2374,VALEYARD: Risk! Risk! Hear how the Doctor condemns himself by his own
2375,words. 
2376,"INQUISITOR: Gentlemen! Doctor, perhaps you should heed the Valeyard."
2377,May I suggest that for the time being you have said enough. 
2378,DOCTOR: Said enough? Said enough? I have a great deal more to say. 
2379,"INQUISITOR: Be silent, Doctor. "
2380,DOCTOR: I wish to demonstrate 
2381,INQUISITOR: You will have your turn when the Valeyard has finished his
2382,presentation. 
2383,"VALEYARD: Thank you, Inquisitor. "
2384,"DOCTOR: Well, if the rest of his presentation is as riveting as the"
2385,"first little epic, wake me when it's finished. "
2386,VALEYARD: Finished? I've barely started. 
2387,"DOCTOR: Well, for nothing more than your future in the legal"
2388,"profession, I only hope your evidence gets a little better. "
2389,"VALEYARD: Oh yes, Doctor, much better. The most damning is still to"
2390,"come. And when I have finished, this court will demand your life. "
