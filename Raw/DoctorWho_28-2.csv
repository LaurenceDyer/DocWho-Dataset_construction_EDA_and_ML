20,
21,(A group of cowled figures cross the windy moor
22,with their cart and enter the courtyard of a large house. They are
23,"greeted by the main manservant of the household. From the accents, we"
24,"are in Scotland, the clothes say 19th century.) "
25,"STEWARD: Come now, Father. You should know better. You're not welcome"
26,"here, and especially not today. I've got no time to start old"
27,arguments. 
28,ANGELO: We want only one thing. 
29,STEWARD: And what would that be? 
30,ANGELO: This house. 
31,STEWARD: You want the house? 
32,ANGELO: We will take the house. 
33,STEWARD: Would you like my wife while you're at it? 
34,"ANGELO: If you won't stand aside, then we'll take it by force. "
35,STEWARD: By what power? The Hand of God? 
36,ANGELO: No. The Fist of Man. 
37,"(The holy father fights like an eastern martial arts master, using his"
38,"long staff to good effect. At his signal, the other monks drop their"
39,homespun robes to reveal that each of them is bald and wearing a red
40,"Gi. They take on and defeat the rest of the men, complete with Matrix"
41,"style slow motion leaps. Then they go into the house, taking most of"
42,the rest of the servants prisoner.) 
43,
44,[Cellar]
45,
46,"(The servants are chained up in a cellar, along"
47,with their mistress.) 
48,STEWARD: In the name of Heaven. My Lady? 
49,(The monks wheel a covered crate down the slope into the cellar.) 
50,"STEWARD: What's in there? What is it, what's under the canvas? Father,"
51,answer me. What's in there? 
52,ANGELO: May God forgive me. 
53,(The canvas is removed and the monks leave. The captives scream.)
54,
55,[Tardis]
56,
57,(Rose has changed into denim mini-dungarees). 
58,ROSE: What do you think of this? Will it do? 
59,"DOCTOR: In the late 1970s? You'd be better off in a bin bag. Hold on,"
60,listen to this. 
61,(The Doctor puts a CD into the Tardis player.) 
62,DOCTOR: Ian Dury and the Blockheads. Number One in 1979. 
63,ROSE: You're a punk. 
64,DOCTOR: It's good to be a lunatic. 
65,ROSE: That's what you are. A big old punk with a bit of rockabillly
66,thrown in. 
67,DOCTOR: Would you like to see him? 
68,ROSE: How'd you mean? In concert? 
69,DOCTOR: What else is a Tardis for? I can take you to the Battle of
70,"Trafalgar, the first anti-gravity Olympics, Caesar crossing the Rubicon"
71,"or Ian Dury at the Top Rank, Sheffield, England, Earth, 21st November,"
72,1979. What do you think? 
73,ROSE: Sheffield it is. 
74,DOCTOR: Hold on tight. 
75,(The Doctor beats the rhythm of the song on the console as they
76,travel.) 
77,ROSE: Stop! 
78,"(They stop suddenly, and get thrown to the floor.) "
79,DOCTOR: 1979. Hell of a year. China invades Vietnam. The Muppet Movie.
80,"Love that film. Margaret Thatcher. Urgh. Skylab falls to Earth, with a"
81,little help from me. Nearly took off my thumb. 
82,[Highlands]
83,
84,DOCTOR: And I like my thumb. I need my thumb. I'm
85,very attached to 
86,(Rifles are cocked.) 
87,DOCTOR: My thumb. 
88,(They are surrounded by Redcoats. The officer in charge is on a black
89,horse.) 
90,DOCTOR: 1879. Same difference. 
91,REYNOLDS: You will explain your presence. And the nakedness of this
92,girl. 
93,(David reverts to his natural accent.) 
94,DOCTOR: Are we in Scotland? 
95,REYNOLDS: How can you be ignorant of that? 
96,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm, I'm dazed and confused. I've been chasing this, this"
97,"wee naked child over hill and over dale. Isn't that right, ya timorous"
98,beastie? 
99,"ROSE: Och, aye! I've been oot and aboot. "
100,"DOCTOR: No, don't do that. "
101,ROSE: Hoots mon. 
102,"DOCTOR: No, really don't. Really. "
103,"REYNOLDS: Will you identify yourself, sir? "
104,"DOCTOR: I'm Doctor James McCrimmon, from the township of Balamory. I"
105,"have my credentials, if I may. "
106,(He gets out his psychic paper.) 
107,"DOCTOR: As you can see, a Doctorate from the University of Edinburgh. I"
108,trained under Doctor Bell himself. 
109,(An upper-class English accent comes from a carriage nearby.) 
110,VICTORIA : Let them approach. 
111,"REYNOLDS: I don't think that's wise, ma'am. "
112,VICTORIA : Let them approach. 
113,"REYNOLDS: You will approach the carriage, and show all due deference. "
114,(A footman opens the door to reveal the Imperial Widow.) 
115,"DOCTOR: Rose, might I introduce her Majesty Queen Victoria. Empress of"
116,India and Defender of the Faith. 
117,"ROSE: Rose Tyler, Ma'am. And my apologies for being so naked. "
118,"VICTORIA: I've had five daughters. It's nothing to me. But you, Doctor."
119,Show me these credentials. 
120,(He hands her the psychic paper.) 
121,VICTORIA: Why didn't you say so immediately? It states clearly here
122,that you have been appointed by the Lord Provost as my Protector. 
123,"DOCTOR: Does it? Yes, it does. Good. Good. Then let me ask - why is"
124,Your Majesty travelling by road when there's a train all the way to
125,Aberdeen? 
126,VICTORIA: A tree on the line. 
127,DOCTOR: An accident? 
128,VICTORIA: I am the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
129,Ireland. Everything around me tends to be planned. 
130,DOCTOR: An assassination attempt? 
131,"ROSE: What, seriously? There's people out to kill you? "
132,VICTORIA: I'm quite used to staring down the barrel of a gun. 
133,REYNOLDS: Sir Robert MacLeish lives but ten miles hence. We've sent
134,"word ahead. He'll shelter us for tonight, then we can reach Balmoral"
135,tomorrow. 
136,VICTORIA: This Doctor and his timorous beastie will come with us. 
137,"REYNOLDS: Yes, Ma'am. We'd better get moving - it's almost nightfall. "
138,VICTORIA: Indeed. And there are stories of wolves in these parts.
139,"Fanciful tales intended to scare the children. But good for the blood,"
140,I think. Drive on! 
141,(The Doctor and Rose walk with the soldiers behind the carriage.) 
142,"ROSE: It's funny though, because you say assassination and you just"
143,think of Kennedy and stuff. Not her. 
144,"DOCTOR: 1879? She's had, oh, six attempts on her life? And I'll tell"
145,you something else. We just met Queen Victoria! 
146,ROSE: I know! 
147,DOCTOR: What a laugh! 
148,ROSE: She was just sitting there. 
149,DOCTOR: Like a stamp. 
150,ROSE: I want her to say we are not amused. I bet you five quid I can
151,make her say it. 
152,"DOCTOR: Well, if I gambled on that, it'd be an abuse of my privileges"
153,of traveller in time. 
154,ROSE: Ten quid? 
155,DOCTOR: Done.
156,
157,[Torchwood House]
158,
159,(We finally see the grand granite edifice that owns
160,the courtyard. It has a large astronomical observatory on the roof. The
161,master of the house watches the Royal procession enter the courtyard
162,from an upstairs window.) 
163,ROBERT: I can't do this. It's treason. 
164,(Father Angelo is dressed as a butler.) 
165,"ANGELO: Then your wife will suffer the consequences. And believe me,"
166,"Sir Robert, she will be devoured. "
167,
168,[Courtyard]
169,
170,(Sir Robert comes out to meet Queen Victoria. The
171,rest of the monks are also dressed as indoor servants.) 
172,ROBERT: Your Majesty. 
173,VICTORIA: Sir Robert. My apologies for the emergency. And how is Lady
174,Isobel? 
175,"ROBERT: She's indisposed, I'm afraid. She's gone to Edinburgh for the"
176,season. And she's taken the cook with her. The kitchens are barely
177,stocked. I wouldn't blame Your Majesty if you wanted to ride on. 
178,"VICTORIA: Oh, not at all. I've had quite enough carriage exercise. And"
179,"this is charming, if rustic. It's my first visit to this house. My late"
180,"husband spoke of it often. The Torchwood Estate. Now, shall we go"
181,inside? And please excuse the naked girl. 
182,ROSE: Sorry. 
183,DOCTOR: She's a feral child. I bought her for sixpence in old London
184,"Town. It's was her or the Elephant Man, so "
185,"ROSE: Thinks he's funny but I'm so not amused. What do you think,"
186,Ma'am? 
187,VICTORIA: It hardly matters. Shall we proceed? 
188,ROSE: So close. 
189,(Queen Victoria goes inside.) 
190,"REYNOLDS: Makerson and Ramsey, you will escort the property. Hurry up. "
191,"SOLDIERS: Yes, sir. "
192,(They take a small locked box from the carriage and carry it into the
193,house.) 
194,"DOCTOR: So what's in there, then? "
195,"REYNOLDS: Property of the Crown. You will dismiss any further thoughts,"
196,sir. The rest of you go to the rear of the house. Assume your
197,designated positions. 
198,SOLDIER: You heard the orders. Positions. SOLDIER 2: Sir. 
199,(The shadows of the solders pass the cellar lights. A cloaked figure in
200,the cage makes the Shush gesture to the captives.)
201,
202,[Strongroom]
203,
204,(One of the soldiers places the wooden box inside
205,an iron lattice crate.) 
206,REYNOLDS: Guard it with your life. 
207, [Observatory]
208,
209,"VICTORIA: This, I take it, is the famous Endeavour."
210,
211,(A massive bronze telescope.) 
212,ROBERT: All my father's work. Built by hand in his final years. Became
213,something of an obsession. He spent his money on this rather than
214,caring for the house or himself. 
215,DOCTOR: I wish I'd met him. I like him. That thing's beautiful. Can I? 
216,ROBERT: Help yourself. 
217,DOCTOR: What did he model it on? 
218,"ROBERT: I know nothing about it. To be honest, most of us thought him a"
219,"little, shall we say, eccentric. I wish now I'd spent more time with"
220,him and listened to his stories. 
221,DOCTOR: It's a bit rubbish. How many prisms has it got? Way too many.
222,The magnification's gone right over the top. That's stupid kind of (to
223,Rose) Am I being rude again? 
224,ROSE: Yep. 
225,DOCTOR: But it's pretty. It's very pretty. 
226,VICTORIA: And the imagination of it should be applauded. 
227,"ROSE: Mmm. Thought you might disapprove, Your Majesty. Stargazing."
228,"Isn't that a bit fanciful? You could easily not be amused, or"
229,something? No? 
230,VICTORIA: This device surveys the infinite work of God. What could be
231,"finer? Sir Robert's father was an example to us all. A polymath,"
232,"steeped in astronomy and sciences, yet equally well versed in folklore"
233,and fairytales. 
234,DOCTOR: Stars and magic. I like him more and more. 
235,"VICTORIA: Oh, my late husband enjoyed his company. Prince Albert"
236,"himself was acquainted with many rural superstitions, coming as he did"
237,from Saxe Coburg. 
238,DOCTOR: That's Bavaria. 
239,"VICTORIA: When Albert was told about your local wolf, he was"
240,transported. 
241,"DOCTOR: So, what's this wolf, then? "
242,ROBERT: It's just a story. 
243,DOCTOR: Then tell it. 
244,ROBERT: It's said that 
245,"ANGELO: Excuse me, sir. Perhaps her Majesty's party could repair to"
246,their rooms. It's almost dark. 
247,"ROBERT: Of course. Yes, of course. "
248,VICTORIA: And then supper. And could we find some clothes for Miss
249,Tyler? I'm tired of nakedness. 
250,"ROSE: It's not amusing, is it? "
251,"VICTORIA: Sir Robert, your wife must have left some clothes. See to it."
252,"We shall dine at seven, and talk some more of this wolf. After all,"
253,there is a full moon tonight. 
254,"ROBERT: So there is, Ma'am."
255,
256,[Bedroom]
257,
258,(Rose explores the contents of a wardrobe. 
259,"Downstairs in the kitchen, the monks are making a brew with mistletoe,"
260,under the watchful gaze of Father Angelo. 
261,Rose finds a blue velvet dress that is to her liking. 
262,The monks serve mugs of their special brew to the soldiers on guard. 
263,Rose opens another cupboard and discovers a housemaid. 
264,The soldiers fall down. The monks take their weapons.) 
265,FLORA: They came through the house. In the excitement they took the
266,"Steward and the Master, and my Lady. "
267,ROSE: Listen. I've got a friend. He's called the Doctor. He'll know
268,what to do. You've
269,got to come with me. 
270,"FLORA: Oh, but I can't, Miss. "
271,ROSE: What's your name? 
272,FLORA: Flora. 
273,"ROSE: Flora, we'll be safe. There's more people arrived downstairs,"
274,"soldiers and everything, and they can help us. I promise. Come on."
275,Okay? Come on.
276,
277,[Corridor]
278,
279,(Around the corner they find one of the soldiers
280,lying on the floor.) 
281,"FLORA: Oh, Miss. I did warn you. "
282,"ROSE: He's not dead. I don't think, he must be drugged or something. "
283,(Father Angelo grabs Flora from behind and drags her away. Another
284,takes Rose and a third removes the soldier.) 
285,[Dining room]
286,
287,"ANGELO: Your companion begs an apology, Doctor. Her"
288,clothing has somewhat delayed her. 
289,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's all right. Save her a wee bit of ham. "
290,VICTORIA: The feral child could probably eat it raw. 
291,"REYNOLDS: Very wise, Ma'am. Very witty. "
292,"VICTORIA: Slightly witty, perhaps. I know you rarely get the chance to"
293,"dine with me, Captain, but don't get too excited. I shall contain my"
294,wit in case I do you further injury. 
295,"REYNOLDS: Yes, Ma'am. Sorry, Ma'am. "
296,"DOCTOR: Besides, we're all waiting on Sir Robert. Come, sir. You"
297,promised us a tale of nightmares. 
298,"VICTORIA: Indeed. Since my husband's death, I find myself with more of"
299,a taste for supernatural fiction. 
300,DOCTOR: You must miss him. 
301,"VICTORIA: Very much. Oh, completely. And that's the charm of a ghost"
302,"story, isn't it? Not the scares and chills, that's just for children,"
303,but the hope of some contact with the great beyond. We all want some
304,message from that place. It's the Creator's greatest mystery that we're
305,"allowed no such consolation. The dead stay silent, and we must wait."
306,"Come. Begin your tale, Sir Robert. There's a chill in the air. The wind"
307,is howling through the eaves. Tell us of monsters. 
308,[Cellar]
309,
310,(The young monk in the cage is sitting quietly.) 
311,"ISOBEL: Don't make a sound. They said if we scream or shout, then he"
312,will slaughter us. 
313,ROSE: But he's in a cage. He's a prisoner. He's the same as us. 
314,ISOBEL: He's nothing like us. That creature is not mortal. 
315,(The young man opens his eyes. They are completely black.)
316,
317,[Dining room]
318,
319,ROBERT: The story goes back three hundred years.
320,"Every full moon, the howling rings through the valley. The next"
321,"morning, livestock is found ripped apart and devoured. "
322,REYNOLDS: Tales like this just disguise the work of thieves. Steal a
323,"sheep and blame a wolf, simple as that. "
324,"ROBERT: But sometimes a child goes missing. Once in a generation, a boy"
325,will vanish from his homestead. 
326,[Cellar]
327,
328,"(Rose gets up and moves towards the crate, as far"
329,as the chain will let her.) 
330,"ISOBEL: Don't, child. "
331,ROSE: Who are you? 
332,STEWARD: Don't enrage him. 
333,ROSE: Where are you from? You're not from Earth. What planet are you
334,from? 
335,"WEREWOLF: Oh, intelligence. "
336,ROSE: Where were you born? 
337,"WEREWOLF: This body? Ten miles away. A weakling, heartsick boy, stolen"
338,away at night by the brethren for my cultivation. I carved out his soul
339,and sat in his heart. 
340,[Dining room]
341,
342,DOCTOR: Are there descriptions of the creature? 
343,"ROBERT: Oh, yes, Doctor. Drawings and woodcarvings. And it's not merely"
344,a wolf. It's more than that. This is a man who becomes an animal. 
345,DOCTOR: A werewolf? 
346,[Cellar]
347,
348,"ROSE: All right, so the body's human. But what"
349,"about you, the thing inside? "
350,WEREWOLF: So far from home. 
351,"ROSE: If you want to get back home, we can help. "
352,"WEREWOLF: Why would I leave this place? A world of industry, of"
353,workforce and warfare. I could turn it to such purpose. 
354,ROSE: How would you do that? 
355,WEREWOLF: I would migrate to the Holy Monarch. 
356,ROSE: You mean Queen Victoria? 
357,"WEREWOLF: With one bite, I would pass into her blood, and then it"
358,begins. The Empire of the Wolf. Many questions. 
359,(The young man lunges at the crate.) 
360,WEREWOLF: Look. Inside your eyes. You've seen it too. 
361,ROSE: Seen what? 
362,WEREWOLF: The Wolf. There is something of the Wolf about you. 
363,ROSE: I don't know what you mean. 
364,"WEREWOLF: You burnt like the sun, but all I require is the moon. "
365,[Dining room]
366,
367,(The full moon hangs high in the sky.) 
368,ROBERT: My father didn't treat it as a story. He said it was fact. He
369,"even claimed to have communed with the beast, to have learned its"
370,purpose. I should have listened. His work was hindered. He made
371,enemies. There's a monastery in the Glen of Saint Catherine. The
372,Brethren opposed my father's investigations. 
373,(Angelo gazes out at the moon and starts chanting lupus deus est.) 
374,VICTORIA: Perhaps they thought his work ungodly. 
375,ROBERT: That's what I thought. But now I wonder. What if they had a
376,different reason for wanting the story kept quiet? What if they turned
377,from God and worshipped the wolf? 
378,DOCTOR: And what if they were with us right now?
379,
380,[Cellar]
381,
382,"(The cellar doors are flung open, and the light"
383,shines in on the crate.) 
384,WEREWOLF: Moonlight 
385,(The young man removes his cloak as an unnatural wind starts to blow
386,through the cellar.) 
387,"ROSE: All of you! Stop looking at it! Flora, don't look. Listen to me."
388,Grab hold of the chain and pull! Come on! With me! Pull! 
389,(The young man begins his transformation.) 
390,ROSE: I said pull! Stop your whining and listen to me! All of you! And
391,"that means you, your Ladyship. Now come on, pull! "
392,[Dining room]
393,
394,VICTORIA: What is the meaning of this? 
395,"REYNOLDS: Explain yourself, Sir Robert! "
396,VICTORIA: What's happening? 
397,"ROBERT: I'm sorry, Your Majesty, they've got my wife. "
398,"DOCTOR: Rose! Where's Rose? Where is she? Sir Robert, come on! "
399,(Captain Reynolds keeps his revolver trained on the chanting monk.)
400,
401,[Cellar]
402,
403,(The young man becomes more vulpine.) 
404,"ROSE: One, two, three, pull! One, two, three, pull!"
405,
406,[Dining room]
407,
408,"REYNOLDS: Tell me, sir. I demand to know your"
409,intention! 
410,ANGELO: Lupus deus est. Lupus deus est. 
411,REYNOLDS: What is it that you want? 
412,ANGELO: The throne. 
413,(Angelo disarms Reynolds. Robert and the Doctor run along a corridor.)
414,
415,[Cellar]
416,
417,"(The werewolf is fully formed, and examining its"
418,paws.) 
419,"ROSE: One, two, three, pull! "
420,(The end of the chain breaks free of the wall. The Doctor and Robert
421,kick their way in.) 
422,ROSE: Where the hell have you been? 
423,(The Doctor sees the occupant of the crate.) 
424,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's beautiful. "
425,"ROBERT: Come on, go. Get out! "
426,(The werewolf breaks out of the crate.) 
427,DOCTOR: Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! 
428,ROSE: Come on. 
429,"(The Doctor stares in admiration, then ducks as it throws a piece of"
430,crate at him. He runs out and locks the door with the sonic
431,screwdriver.)
432,
433,[Dining room]
434,
435,(The werewolf's howl echoes through the house.) 
436,"VICTORIA: I take it, sir, that you halted my train to bring me here? "
437,ANGELO: We have waited so long for one of your journeys to coincide
438,with the moon. 
439,VICTORIA: Then you have waited in vain. After six attempts on my life 
440,(She takes a small gun from her handbag.) 
441,VICTORIA: I am hardly unprepared. 
442,"ANGELO: Oh, I don't think so, woman. "
443,VICTORIA: The correct form of address is Your Majesty. 
444,(Victoria shoots at Angelo.)
445,
446,[Gun room]
447,
448,(The Steward hands out the contents of the gun
449,cupboard to the men.)
450,"STEWARD: Arms, and you five. Ready, everyone? (to Lady Isobel) Take the"
451,girls. Get them out through the kitchen. 
452,ISOBEL: I can't leave you. What will you do? 
453,"ROBERT: I must defend her Majesty. Now, don't think of me, just go. "
454,"ISOBEL: All of you, at my side. Come on! "
455,(The Doctor is removing the shackles with the sonic screwdriver.) 
456,DOCTOR: It could be any form of light modulated species triggered by
457,specific wavelengths. Did it say what it wanted? 
458,"ROSE: The Queen, the Crown, the throne - you name it. "
459,(There is a crash of something bursting through a wooden door. The
460,Doctor goes out to investigate and sees the werewolf at the other end
461,of the passageway. He runs back in and grabs Rose.) 
462,STEWARD: Fire! Fire! 
463,[Kitchen]
464,
465,(The outside door will not open.) 
466,ISOBEL: It won't open. They've sealed us in. 
467,"FLORA: Oh, my Lady. Look! "
468,(Monks armed with the soldier's rifles stand outside.) 
469,FLORA: They'll never let us out. They mean for us to die! 
470,"ISOBEL: Don't say that, Flora! "

472,
473,"DOCTOR: All right, you men. We should retreat"
474,upstairs. Come with me. 
475,STEWARD: I'll not retreat. The battle's done. There's no creature on
476,God's Earth that could survive such an assault. 
477,"DOCTOR: I'm telling you, come upstairs! "
478,"STEWARD: And I'm telling you, sir, I will sleep well tonight with that"
479,thing's hide upon my wall. 
480,(The Steward steps into the corridor then looks back.) 
481,STEWARD: It must have crawled away to die. 
482,(The Steward is hoisted up to the ceiling.) 
483,DOCTOR: There's nothing we can do! 
484,(Sounds of snarling and wet meat ripping.)
485,
486,[Kitchen]
487,
488,(The women hear the shouting and gunshots.) 
489,FLORA: Did they kill it? 
490,"(The werewolf enters, sniffs the air and leaves. "
491,"Meanwhile, Victoria recovers her property from the strongroom.)"
492,
493,[Staircase]
494,
495,ROBERT: Your Majesty? Your Majesty! 
496,VICTORIA: Sir Robert? What's happening? 
497,(Victoria comes down the stairs.) 
498,VICTORIA: I heard such terrible noises. 
499,"ROBERT: Your Majesty, we've got to get out. But what of Father Angelo?"
500,Is he still here? 
501,VICTORIA: Captain Reynolds disposed of him. 
502,"DOCTOR: The front door's no good, it's been boarded shut. Pardon me,"
503,Your Majesty. You'll have to leg it out of a window. 
504,[Drawing room]
505,
506,"ROBERT: Excuse my manners, Ma'am, but I shall go"
507,"first, the better to assist Her Majesty's egress. "
508,"VICTORIA: A noble sentiment, my Sir Walter Raleigh. "
509,(The Doctor regains his London accent.) 
510,"DOCTOR: Yeah, any chance you could hurry up? "
511,(Robert opens the window and the monks outside open fire.) 
512,DOCTOR: I reckon the monkey boys want us to stay inside. 
513,VICTORIA: Do they know who I am?? 
514,"ROSE: Yeah, that's why they want you. The wolf's lined you up for a, a"
515,biting. 
516,VICTORIA: Stop this talk. There can't be an actual wolf. 
517,(Howl!)
518,
519,[Corridor]
520,
521,ROSE: What do we do? 
522,DOCTOR: We run. 
523,ROSE: Is that it? 
524,DOCTOR: You got any silver bullets? 
525,"ROSE: Not on me, no. "
526,"DOCTOR: There we are then, we run. Your Majesty, as a Doctor, I"
527,recommend a vigourous jog. Good for the health. Come on! 
528,(They head up the staircase.)
529,
530,[Staircase]
531,
532,(The werewolf smashes its way out of below stairs
533,and follows them.) 
534,DOCTOR: Come on! Come on! 
535,[Library corridor]
536,
537,(The werewolf is nearly upon them when Reynolds
538,turns and shoots. It retreats.) 
539,"REYNOLDS: I'll take this position and hold it. You keep moving, for"
540,"God's sake! Your Majesty, I went to look for the property and it was"
541,taken. The chest was empty. 
542,VICTORIA: I have it. It's safe. 
543,"REYNOLDS: Then remove yourself, Ma'am. Doctor, you stand as Her"
544,"Majesty's Protector. And you, Sir Robert, you're a traitor to the"
545,crown. 
546,DOCTOR: Bullets can't stop it! 
547,REYNOLDS: They'll buy you time. Now run! 
548,[Library]
549,
550,(Reynolds empties his revolver at the werewolf
551,before it pounces and rips him apart.) 
552,DOCTOR: Rose! 
553,(The Doctor drags her inside the room.) 
554,ROBERT: Barricade the door. 
555,(They do.) 
556,"DOCTOR: Wait a minute. Shush, shush, wait a minute. "
557,(There is one lonely howl.) 
558,DOCTOR: It's stopped. 
559,"(The werewolf sniffs at the door, then leaves.) "
560,DOCTOR: It's gone. 
561,ROSE: Listen. 
562,(There are footsteps and growls from outside the walls as it walks
563,around the room.) 
564,DOCTOR: Is this the only door? 
565,ROBERT: Yes. No! 
566,(They quickly barricade the other door.) 
567,ROSE: Shush. 
568,(The noises continue outside the walls.) 
569,ROSE: I don't understand. What's stopping it? 
570,DOCTOR: Something inside this room. What is it? Why can't it get in? 
571,"ROSE: I'll tell you what, though. "
572,DOCTOR: What? 
573,ROSE: Werewolf. 
574,DOCTOR: I know. You all right? 
575,"ROSE: I'm okay, yeah. "
576,"ROBERT: I'm sorry, Ma'am. It's all my fault. I should have sent you"
577,away. I tried to suggest something was wrong. I thought you might
578,notice. Did you think there was nothing strange about my household
579,staff? 
580,"DOCTOR: Well, they were bald, athletic. Your wife's away, I just"
581,thought you were happy. 
582,"ROSE: I'll tell you what though, Ma'am, I bet you're not amused now. "
583,VICTORIA: Do you think this is funny? 
584,"ROSE: No, Ma'am. I'm sorry. "
585,"VICTORIA: What, exactly, I pray tell me, someone, please. What exactly"
586,is that creature? 
587,"DOCTOR: You'd call it a werewolf, but technically it's a more of a"
588,lupine wavelength haemovariform. 
589,"VICTORIA: And should I trust you, sir? You who change your voice so"
590,easily? What happened to your accent? 
591,"DOCTOR: Oh right, sorry, that's "
592,"VICTORIA: I'll not have it. No, sir. Not you, not that thing, none of"
593,it. This is not my world. 
594,[Kitchen]
595,
596,(Isobel spots something draped over the shoulders
597,of the guarding monks.) 
598,ISOBEL: Mistletoe. They're all garlanded in mistletoe and the wolf
599,doesn't attack them. Who brought this into the kitchen? 
600,FLORA: It must've been the Brethren. 
601,"ISOBEL: Gather it up. Quickly. Every last scrap. Quick, now! "
602,[Library]
603,
604,(A carving of mistletoe on the door.) 
605,"DOCTOR: Mistletoe. Sir Robert, did you father put that there? "
606,ROBERT: I don't know. I suppose. 
607,"DOCTOR: On the other door, too. No, a carving wouldn't be enough. I"
608,wonder. 
609,(He licks the woodwork.) 
610,"DOCTOR: Viscum album, the oil of the mistletoe. It's been worked into"
611,the wood like a varnish. How clever was your dad? I love him. Powerful
612,"stuff, mistletoe. Bursting with lectins and viscotoxins. "
613,ROSE: And the wolf's allergic to it? 
614,"DOCTOR: Well, it thinks it is. The monkey monk monks need a way of"
615,"controlling the wolf, maybe they trained it to react against certain"
616,things. 
617,"ROBERT: Nevertheless, that creature won't give up, Doctor, and we still"
618,don't possess an actual weapon. 
619,"DOCTOR: Oh, your father got all the brains, didn't he? "
620,ROSE: Being rude again. 
621,DOCTOR: Good. I meant that one. You want weapons? We're in a library.
622,Books! Best weapons in the world. This room's the greatest arsenal we
623,could have. 
624,(He throws some books to Rose.) 
625,DOCTOR: Arm yourself. 
626,[Kitchen]
627,
628,(The housemaids are chopping up the remaining
629,mistletoe.) 
630,"FLORA: There's no sound of the wolf, my Lady. Perhaps it's gone. "
631,"ISOBEL: Perhaps it's toying with us. But my husband's up there, and if"
632,"there's any chance he's still alive, then by God, I'll assist him. "
633,(Flora throws the mistletoe into boiling water.)
634,
635,[Library]
636,
637,"ROSE: Biology, zoology. There might be something on"
638,wolves in here 
639,"DOCTOR: Hold on, what about this? A book on mistletoe. "
640,ROSE: A book on magic. 
641,ROBERT: Some form of explosive. 
642,"DOCTOR: Hmm, that's the sort of thing."
643,"ROSE: Wolf's bane, what about that? "
644,DOCTOR: Look what your old dad found. Something fell to Earth. 
645,ROSE: A spaceship? 
646,"ROBERT: A shooting star. (reads) In the year of our Lord 1540, under"
647,"the reign of King James the Fifth, an almighty fire did burn in the"
648,pit. That's the Glen of Saint Catherine just by the monastery. 
649,ROSE: But that's over three hundred years ago. What's it been waiting
650,for? 
651,DOCTOR: Maybe just a single cell survived. Adapting slowly down the
652,"generations, it survived through the humans, host after host after"
653,host. 
654,ROBERT: But why does it want the throne? 
655,"ROSE: That's what it wants. It said so. The, the Empire of the Wolf. "
656,DOCTOR: Imagine it. The Victorian Age accelerated. Starships and
657,"missiles fueled by coal and driven by steam, leaving history devastated"
658,in its wake 
659,VICTORIA: Sir Robert. If I am to die here. 
660,"ROBERT: Don't say that, Your Majesty. "
661,VICTORIA: I would destroy myself rather than let that creature infect
662,me. But that's no matter. I ask only that you find some place of
663,safekeeping for something far older and more precious than myself. 
664,DOCTOR: Hardly the time to worry about your valuables. 
665,"VICTORIA: Thank you for your opinion, but there is nothing more"
666,valuable than this. 
667,(A finest white 105.6 carat diamond.) 
668,ROSE: Is that the Koh-I-Noor? 
669,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. The greatest diamond in the world. "
670,VICTORIA: Given to me as the spoils of war. Perhaps its legend is now
671,coming true. It is said that whoever owns it must surely die. 
672,"DOCTOR: Well, that's true of anything if you own it long enough. Can I?"
673,
674,(The Doctor examines the diamond.) 
675,DOCTOR: That is so beautiful. 
676,ROSE: How much is that worth? 
677,DOCTOR: They say the wages of the entire planet for a whole week. 
678,ROSE: Good job my mum's not here. She'd be fighting the wolf off with
679,her bare hands for that thing. 
680,DOCTOR: And she'd win. 
681,ROBERT: Where is the wolf? I don't trust this silence. 
682,DOCTOR: Why do you travel with it? 
683,"VICTORIA: My annual pilgrimage. I'm taking it to Helier and Carew, the"
684,Royal Jewellers at Hazelhead. The stone needs recutting. 
685,"ROSE: Oh, but it's perfect. "
686,VICTORIA: My late husband never thought so. 
687,"DOCTOR: Now, there's a fact. Prince Albert kept on having the"
688,Koh-I-Noor cut down. It used to be forty percent bigger than this. But
689,he was never happy. Kept on cutting and cutting. 
690,VICTORIA: He always said the shine was not quite right. But he died
691,with it still unfinished. 
692,"DOCTOR: Unfinished. Oh, yes. "
693,(He throws the stone back to Victoria.) 
694,DOCTOR: There's a lot of unfinished business in this house. His
695,"father's research, and your husband, Ma'am, he came here and he sought"
696,"the perfect diamond. Hold on, hold on. All these separate things,"
697,"they're not separate at all, they're connected. Oh, my head, my head."
698,"What if this house, it's a trap for you. Is that right, Ma'am? "
699,VICTORIA: Obviously. 
700,"DOCTOR: At least, that's what the wolf intended. But, what if there's a"
701,trap inside the trap? 
702,"VICTORIA: Explain yourself, Doctor. "
703,DOCTOR: What if his father and your husband weren't just telling each
704,"other stories. They dared to imagine all this was true, and they"
705,"planned against it, laying the real trap not for you but for the wolf. "
706,(Plaster dust falls from the ceiling. They look up to the domes
707,skylight.) 
708,DOCTOR: That wolf there. 
709,(The glass in the skylight cracks.) 
710,DOCTOR: Out! Out! Out!
711,
712,[Library corridor]
713,
714,(The Doctor shuts the mistletoe doors on the
715,werewolf.) 
716,ROBERT: Your Majesty! 
717,DOCTOR: Get to the observatory! 
718,(The werewolf catches up with Rose. She screams then a pan of liquid is
719,thrown over it. It retreats.) 
720,DOCTOR: Good shot. 
721,FLORA: It was mistletoe. 
722,ROBERT: Isobel! 
723,(Robert and Isobel kiss.) 
724,"ROBERT: Now, get back downstairs. "
725,ISOBEL: Keep yourself safe. 
726,ROBERT: Now go. 
727,"ISOBEL: Girls, come with me. Down the back stairs, back to the"
728,kitchens. Quickly! 
729,DOCTOR: Come on! 
730,ROBERT: The observatory's this way. 
731,(They carry on up the staircase as the werewolf recovers.)
732,
733,[Outside the observatory]
734,
735,DOCTOR: No mistletoe in these doors because your
736,father wanted the wolf to get inside. I just need time. Is there any
737,way of barricading this? 
738,ROBERT: Just do your work and I'll defend it. 
739,DOCTOR: If we could bind them shut with rope or something. 
740,"ROBERT: I said I'd find you time, Sir. Now get inside. "
741,DOCTOR: Good man. 
742,[Observatory]
743,
744,"DOCTOR: Your Majesty, the diamond. "
745,VICTORIA: For what purpose? 
746,DOCTOR: The purpose it was designed for. 
747,(Robert takes a sword from a display on the wall and stands ready as
748,the werewolf comes up the stairs. 
749,Victoria hands over the diamond.) 
750,DOCTOR: Rose. 
751,(They go to the control wheels and start raising the telescope up.) 
752,DOCTOR: Lift it. Come on. 
753,ROSE: Is this the right time for stargazing? 
754,DOCTOR: Yes it is.
755,
756,[Outside the observatory]
757,
758,"ROBERT: I committed treason for you, but now my"
759,wife will remember me with honour! 
760,(It is a very short fight. Victoria holds up her jet cross and prays.)
761,
762,[Observatory]
763,
764,ROSE: You said this thing doesn't work. 
765,DOCTOR: It doesn't work as a telescope because that's not what it is.
766,It's a light chamber. It magnifies the light rays like a weapon. We've
767,just got to power it up. 
768,ROSE: It won't work. There's no electricity. Moonlight. But the wolf
769,needs moonlight. It's made by moonlight. 
770,DOCTOR: You're seventy percent water but you can still drown. Come on!
771,Come on! 
772,(The moon shines down into the telescope lens and bounces between the
773,"prisms, magnifying as it goes. The werewolf breaks in and goes for"
774,Queen Victoria. The Doctor slides the diamond over to where the light
775,"hits the floor. It refracts upwards, catching the werewolf in its beam"
776,"and lifting it up off the floor. The wolf turns back into a young man,"
777,hanging as if crucified in mid air.) 
778,WEREWOLF: Make it brighter. Let me go. 
779,(The Doctor adjusts the magnification on the eyepiece. The man turns
780,"back into a wolf shape, howls and vanishes. Victoria looks at a small"
781,scratch on her wrist.) 
782,DOCTOR: Your Majesty? Did it bite you? 
783,"VICTORIA: No, it's, it's a cut, that's all. "
784,DOCTOR: If that thing bit you? 
785,VICTORIA: It was a splinter of wood when the door came apart. It's
786,nothing.
787,DOCTOR: Let me see. 
788,VICTORIA: It is nothing.
789,
790,[Drawing room]
791,
792,"(Morning. In the presence of the whole household,"
793,"the Doctor and Rose kneel before Queen Victoria, who is armed with a"
794,sword..) 
795,"VICTORIA: By the power invested in me by the Church and the State, I"
796,dub thee Sir Doctor of Tardis. By the power invested in me by the
797,"Church and the State, I dub thee Dame Rose of the Powell Estate. You"
798,may stand. 
799,"DOCTOR: Many thanks, Ma'am. "
800,ROSE: Thanks. They're never going to believe this back home. 
801,"DOCTOR: Your Majesty, you said last night about receiving no message"
802,from the great beyond. I think your husband cut that diamond to save
803,"your life. He's protecting you even now, Ma'am, from beyond the grave. "
804,VICTORIA: Indeed. Then you may think on this also. That I am not
805,amused. 
806,ROSE: Yes! 
807,VICTORIA: Not remotely amused. And henceforth I banish you. 
808,DOCTOR: I'm sorry? 
809,"VICTORIA: I have rewarded you, Sir Doctor, and now you are exiled from this"
810,"empire, never to return. I don't know what you are, the two of you, or"
811,"where you're from, but I know that you consort with stars and magic and"
812,think it fun. But your world is steeped in terror and blasphemy and
813,"death, and I will not allow it. You will leave these shores and you will"
814,"reflect, I hope, on how you came to stray so far from all that is good,"
815,and how much longer you may survive this terrible life. Now leave my
816,"world, and never return."
817,
818,[Highlands]
819,
820,DOUGAL: Whoa! 
821,(The Doctor and Rose get off the back of a cart.) 
822,"DOCTOR: Cheers, Dougal! "
823,DOUGAL: Walk on. 
824,"DOCTOR: No, but the funny thing is, Queen Victoria did actually suffer"
825,a mutation of the blood. It's historical record. She was
826,haemophiliac. They used to call it the Royal Disease. But it's always
827,"been a mystery because she didn't inherit it. Her mum didn't have it,"
828,her dad didn't have it. It came from nowhere. 
829,"ROSE: What, and you're saying that's a wolf bite? "
830,"DOCTOR: Well, maybe haemophilia is just a Victorian euphemism. "
831,ROSE: For werewolf? 
832,DOCTOR: Could be. 
833,ROSE: Queen Victoria's a werewolf? 
834,DOCTOR: Could be. And her children had the Royal Disease. Maybe she
835,gave them a quick nip. 
836,"ROSE: So, the Royal Family are werewolves? "
837,"DOCTOR: Well, maybe not yet. I mean, a single wolf cell could take a"
838,"hundred years to mature. Might be ready by, oh, early 21st century? "
839,"ROSE: Nah, that's just ridiculous! Mind you, Princess Anne. "
840,DOCTOR: I'll say no more. 
841,"ROSE: And if you think about it, they're very private. They plan"
842,everything in advance. They could schedule themselves around the moon.
843,We'd never know. And they like hunting! 
844,(The Doctor and Rose go inside the Tardis.) 
845,"ROSE : They love blood sports. Oh my God, they're werewolves! "
846,(The Tardis dematerialises.)
847,
848,[Courtyard]
849,
850,VICTORIA: What will you do? Will you stay here? 
851,"ISOBEL: I don't think I could. I'd sell it, or I'd pull this place"
852,down. 
853,"VICTORIA: Although we may not speak of these events in public, they"
854,"will not be forgotten, I promise you that. Your husband's sacrifice,"
855,"the ingenuity of his father, they will live on. "
856,ISOBEL: But how? 
857,VICTORIA: I saw last night that Great Britain has enemies beyond
858,"imagination, and we must defend our borders on all sides. I propose an"
859,Institute to investigate these strange happenings and to fight them. I
860,would call it Torchwood. The Torchwood Institute. And if this Doctor
861,"should return, then he should beware, because Torchwood will be waiting.  "
