19,  [Tardis]
20,
21, (The Tardis is tumbling out of control and going
22,Bang! inside. It flies over the Millennium Dome with the Doctor
23,"dangling from the threshold, sonic screwdriver between his teeth and"
24,trying to pull himself back inside. They are heading straight for the
25,"Parliament Clock Tower, so the Doctor sonics the controls and changes"
26,course just in time. He climbs back inside and shuts the doors behind
27,"him, exhausted, as the Tardis careers on its way.)"
28,
29,[Bedroom]
30,
31,(Night time. A pinwheel rattles in the overgrown
32,garden of an old house. A little
33,red-haired Scottish girl is saying her prayers.) 
34,AMELIA: Dear Santa. Thank you for the dolls and pencils and the fish.
35,"It's Easter now, so I hope I didn't wake you, but honest, it is an"
36,emergency. There's a crack in my wall. Aunt Sharon says it's just an
37,"ordinary crack, but I know it's not, because at night there's voices,"
38,"so please, please, could you send someone to fix it? Or a policeman. Or"
39,a 
40,"(She hears the Tardis materialising outside, then a crash.) "
41,AMELIA: Back in a moment. 
42,(She grabs a torch and looks outside. The Tardis has crash-landed on
43,"its side, on the garden shed.) "
44,"AMELIA: Thank you, Santa. "
45,[Garden]
46,
47,"(For only the second time ever, the Tardis doors"
48,open outwards - they are facing the sky - and a grappling hook is
49,thrown out. A soaking wet Doctor clambers out.) 
50,DOCTOR: Could I have an apple? All I can think about. Apples. I love
51,apples. Maybe I'm having a craving? That's new. Never had cravings
52,before. 
53,(He sits on the edge of the Tardis and looks inside.) 
54,DOCTOR: Whoa. Look at that. 
55,AMELIA: Are you okay? 
56,"DOCTOR: Just had a fall. All the way down there, right to the library."
57,Hell of a climb back up. 
58,AMELIA: You're soaking wet. 
59,DOCTOR: I was in the swimming pool. 
60,AMELIA: You said you were in the library. 
61,DOCTOR: So was the swimming pool. 
62,AMELIA: Are you a policeman? 
63,DOCTOR: Why? Did you call a policeman? 
64,AMELIA: Did you come about the crack in my wall? 
65,What crack? Argh! 
66,(He falls to the ground.) 
67,"AMELIA: Are you all right, mister? "
68,"DOCTOR: No, I'm fine. It's okay. This is all perfectly norm "
69,(A breath of golden energy comes from his mouth.) 
70,AMELIA: Who are you? 
71,DOCTOR: I don't know yet. I'm still cooking. Does it scare you? 
72,"AMELIA: No, it just looks a bit weird. "
73,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. The crack in your wall. Does it scare you? "
74,AMELIA: Yes. 
75,"DOCTOR: Well then, no time to lose. I'm the Doctor. Do everything I"
76,"tell you, don't ask stupid questions, and don't wander off. "
77,(The Doctor walks straight into a tree.) 
78,AMELIA: Are you all right? 
79,DOCTOR: Early days. Steering's a bit off. 
80,[Kitchen]
81,
82,"AMELIA: If you're a doctor, why does your box say"
83,Police? 
84,"(The Doctor bites into an apple, then spits it out.) "
85,DOCTOR: That's disgusting. What is that? 
86,AMELIA: An apple. 
87,DOCTOR: Apple's rubbish. I hate apples. 
88,AMELIA: You said you loved them. 
89,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. I like yoghurt. Yoghurt's my favourite. Give me"
90,yoghurt. 
91,(Amelia gets him a pot from the fridge. He pours it in his mouth and
92,then spits it out.) 
93,DOCTOR: I hate yoghurt. It's just stuff with bits in. 
94,AMELIA: You said it was your favourite. 
95,DOCTOR: New mouth. New rules. It's like eating after cleaning your
96,teeth. Everything tastes wrong. Argh! 
97,(The Doctor twitches violently.) 
98,AMELIA: What is it? What's wrong with you? 
99,DOCTOR: Wrong with me? It's not my fault. Why can't you give me any
100,decent food? You're Scottish. Fry something. 
101,(So Amelia gets the frying pay out while the Doctor dries his hair with
102,a towel.) 
103,"DOCTOR: Ah, bacon! "
104,"(That gets spat out, too.) "
105,DOCTOR: Bacon. That's bacon. Are you trying to poison me? 
106,(A saucepan of baked beans gets heated up.) 
107,"DOCTOR: Ah, you see? Beans. "
108,"(Until he gets them in his mouth, that is.) "
109,"DOCTOR: Beans are evil. Bad, bad beans. Bread and butter. Now you're"
110,talking. 
111,[Front door]
112,
113,(The Doctor throws the plate of bread and butter
114,"out, hitting a cat.) "
115,DOCTOR: And stay out! 
116,[Kitchen]
117,
118,AMELIA: We've got some carrots. 
119,DOCTOR: Carrots? Are you insane? No. Wait. Hang on. I know what I need.
120,"I need, I need, I need fish fingers and custard. "
121,(The Doctor contentedly dips the fish fingers into a bowl of custard
122,"and eats, while Amelia has ice cream.Â "
123,AMELIA: Funny. 
124,DOCTOR: Am I? Good. Funny's good. What's your name? 
125,AMELIA: Amelia Pond. 
126,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's a brilliant name. Amelia Pond. Like a name in a"
127,"fairy tale. Are we in Scotland, Amelia? "
128,AMELIA: No. We had to move to England. It's rubbish. 
129,"DOCTOR: So what about your mum and dad, then? Are they upstairs?"
130,Thought we'd have woken them by now. 
131,AMELIA: I don't have a mum and dad. Just an aunt. 
132,DOCTOR: I don't even have an aunt. 
133,AMELIA: You're lucky. 
134,"DOCTOR: I know. So, your aunt, where is she? "
135,AMELIA: She's out. 
136,DOCTOR: And she left you all alone? 
137,AMELIA: I'm not scared. 
138,"DOCTOR: Course, you're not. You're not scared of anything. Box falls"
139,"out of the sky, man falls out of a box, man eats fish custard, and look"
140,"at you, just sitting there. So you know what I think? "
141,AMELIA: What? 
142,DOCTOR: Must be a hell of a scary crack in your wall. 
143,[Bedroom]
144,
145,"(The crack is about three to four feet long, and"
146,slightly w shaped.) 
147,"DOCTOR: You've had some cowboys in here. Not actual cowboys, though"
148,that can happen. 
149,"AMELIA: I used to hate apples, so my mum put faces on them. "
150,(Amelia gives the Doctor an apple with a smiley face cut into it.) 
151,"DOCTOR: She sounds good, your mum. I'll keep it for later. This wall is"
152,solid and the crack doesn't go all the way through it. So here's a
153,thing. Where's the draught coming from? 
154,(He scans it with the sonic screwdriver.) 
155,DOCTOR: Wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey. You know what the crack is? 
156,AMELIA: What? 
157,DOCTOR: It's a crack. But I'll tell you something funny. If you knocked
158,"this wall down, the crack would stay put, because the crack isn't in"
159,the wall. 
160,AMELIA: Where is it then? 
161,DOCTOR: Everywhere. In everything. It's a split in the skin of the
162,"world. Two parts of space and time that should never have touched,"
163,"pressed together right here in the wall of your bedroom. Sometimes, can"
164,you hear? 
165,AMELIA: A voice. Yes. 
166,(There is a vague growling from somewhere. The Doctor empties Amelia's
167,nighttime glass of water and uses it to listen to the crack.) 
168,ATRAXI : Prisoner Zero has escaped. 
169,DOCTOR: Prisoner Zero? 
170,AMELIA: Prisoner Zero has escaped. That's what I heard. What does it
171,mean? 
172,ATRAXI : Prisoner Zero has escaped. 
173,"DOCTOR: It means that on the other side of this wall, there's a prison"
174,and they've lost a prisoner. And you know what that means? 
175,AMELIA: What? 
176,DOCTOR: You need a better wall. The only way to close the breach is to
177,open it all the way. The forces will invert and it'll snap itself shut.
178,Or 
179,AMELIA: What? 
180,DOCTOR: You know when grown-ups tell you everything's going to be fine
181,and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? 
182,AMELIA: Yes. 
183,DOCTOR: Everything's going to be fine. 
184,(The Doctor takes little Amelia's hand and aims the sonic screwdriver
185,"at the crack. It widens, flooding the bedroom with bright light.) "
186,ATRAXI : Prisoner Zero has escaped. Prisoner Zero has escaped. 
187,DOCTOR: Hello? Hello? 
188,(A giant blue eye looks at them through the crack.) 
189,AMELIA: What's that? 
190,"(A bolt of light goes to the Doctor, and he doubles over, then the"
191,crack closes again.) 
192,"DOCTOR: There, you see? Told you it would close. Good as new. "
193,AMELIA: What's that thing? Was that Prisoner Zero? 
194,"DOCTOR: No. I think that was Prisoner Zero's guard. Whatever it was, it"
195,sent me a message. Psychic paper. Takes a lovely little message.
196,(reads) Prisoner Zero has escaped. But why tell us? Unless. 
197,AMELIA: Unless what? 
198,DOCTOR: Unless Prisoner Zero escaped through here. But he couldn't
199,have. We'd know. 
200,[Corridor]
201,
202,(The stairs go up. There is a door across the way
203,and two at the far end where the staircase goes down again.) 
204,DOCTOR: It's difficult. Brand new me. Nothing works yet. But there's
205,something I'm missing. In the corner of my eye. 
206,(The Tardis Cloister Bell tolls.) 
207,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! "
208,[Garden]
209,
210,DOCTOR: I've got to get back in there. The engines
211,are phasing. It's going to burn! 
212,AMELIA: But it's just a box. How can a box have engines? 
213,DOCTOR: It's not a box. It's a time machine. 
214,"AMELIA: What, a real one? You've got a real time machine? "
215,DOCTOR: Not for much longer if I can't get her stabilised. Five minute
216,hop into the future should do it. 
217,AMELIA: Can I come? 
218,"DOCTOR: Not safe in here. Not yet. Five minutes. Give me five minutes,"
219,I'll be right back. 
220,AMELIA: People always say that. 
221,DOCTOR: Am I people? Do I even look like people? Trust me. I'm the
222,Doctor. 
223,(He jumps down into the Tardis.) 
224,DOCTOR : Geronimo! 
225,(Splash! The door close and the Tardis dematerialises. Amelia runs back
226,"to her room, gets a suitcase from underneath her bed and packs. The"
227,door across from hers is the bathroom. She doesn't notice that one of
228,"the doors at the end is now open. Dressed in duffel coat and wooly hat,"
229,Amelia sits on her suitcase in the garden and waits. 
230,"(When the Tardis finally materialises, steaming, it is day and Amelia"
231,is not there. The Doctor stumbles out.) 
232,"DOCTOR: Amelia! Amelia, I worked out what it was. I know what I was"
233,missing! You've got to get out of there! 
234,[Hallway]
235,
236,"DOCTOR: Amelia? Amelia, are you all right? Are you"
237,there? 
238,(He runs up to her bedroom door.) 
239,DOCTOR: Prisoner Zero's here. Prisoner Zero is here! Prisoner Zero is
240,here! Do you understand me? Prisoner Zero is 
241,(A floorboard creaks behind him. He turns and gets knocked out by a
242,cricket bat.)
243,
244,[Coma ward]
245,
246,"(At the Royal Leadworth Hospital, a lady doctor and"
247,a male nurse march into the ward.) 
248,"RAMSDEN: So. They all called out at once, that's what you're saying?"
249,All of them. All the coma patients. You do understand that these people
250,"are all comatose, don't you? They can't speak. "
251,"RORY: Yes, Doctor Ramsden. "
252,RAMSDEN: Then why are you wasting my time? 
253,RORY: Because they called for you. 
254,RAMSDEN: Me. 
255,BARNEY : Doctor. 
256,(The male coma patient behind them is speaking.) 
257,BARNEY: Doctor. Doctor. 
258,WOMAN PATIENT: Doctor. Doctor 
259,PATIENTS: Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. 
260,[Corridor]
261,
262,(The Doctor revives with the tweeting of birds to
263,see a young lady in a micro-skirted police uniform using her radio.) 
264,"AMY: White male, mid twenties, breaking and entering. Send me some"
265,"back-up. I've got him restrained. Oi! You, sit still. "
266,DOCTOR: Cricket bat. I'm getting cricket bat. 
267,AMY: You were breaking and entering. 
268,(The Doctor is handcuffed to the radiator.) 
269,"DOCTOR: Well, that's much better. Brand new me. Whack on the head, just"
270,what I needed. 
271,AMY: Do you want to shut up now? I've got back up on the way. 
272,"DOCTOR: Hang on, no, wait. You're a policewoman. "
273,AMY: And you're breaking and entering. You see how this works? 
274,DOCTOR: But what are you doing here? Where's Amelia? 
275,AMY: Amelia Pond? 
276,"DOCTOR: Yeah, Amelia. Little Scottish girl. Where is she? I promised"
277,her five minutes but the engines were phasing. I suppose I must have
278,gone a bit far. Has something happened to her? 
279,AMY: Amelia Pond hasn't lived here in a long time. 
280,DOCTOR: How long? 
281,AMY: Six months. 
282,"DOCTOR: No. No. No. No, I can't be six months late. I said five"
283,minutes. I promised. What happened to her? What happened to Amelia
284,Pond? 
285,"AMY: (into radio) Sarge, it's me again. Hurry it up. This guy knows"
286,something about Amelia Pond. 
287,[Coma ward]
288,
289,RAMSDEN: I don't think they were even conscious. 
290,"RORY: Doctor Ramsden, there is another sort of er, funny thing. "
291,"RAMSDEN: Yes, I know. Doctor Carver told me about your conversation."
292,"We've been very patient with you, Rory. You're a good enough nurse, but"
293,for God's sake. 
294,RORY: I've seen them. 
295,RAMSDEN: These patients are under twenty four hour supervision. We know
296,if their blood pressure changes. There is no possibility that you could
297,have seen them wandering about the village. Why are you giving me your
298,phone? 
299,RORY: It's a camera too. 
300,(Doctor Ramsden's bleeper goes off.) 
301,"RAMSDEN: You need to take some time off, Rory. A lot of time off. Start"
302,now. Now. 
303,[Corridor]
304,
305,DOCTOR: I need to speak to whoever lives in this
306,house right now. 
307,AMY: I live here. 
308,DOCTOR: But you're the police. 
309,"AMY: Yes, and this is where I live. Have you got a problem with that? "
310,DOCTOR: How many rooms? 
311,"AMY: I'm sorry, what? "
312,DOCTOR: On this floor. How many rooms on this floor? Count them for me
313,now. 
314,AMY: Why? 
315,DOCTOR: Because it will change your life. 
316,"AMY: Five. One, two, three, four, five. "
317,DOCTOR: Six. 
318,AMY: Six? 
319,DOCTOR: Look. 
320,AMY: Look where? 
321,Exactly where you don't want to look. Where you never want to look. The
322,corner of your eye. Look behind you. 
323,"AMY: That's, that is not possible. How's that possible? "
324,DOCTOR: There's a perception filter all round the door. Sensed it the
325,last time I was here. Should've seen it. 
326,AMY: But that's a whole room. That's a whole room I've never even
327,noticed. 
328,DOCTOR: The filter stops you noticing. Something came a while ago to
329,"hide. It's still hiding, and you need to uncuff me now. "
330,AMY: I don't have the key. I lost it. 
331,DOCTOR: How can you have lost it? Stay away from that door! Do not
332,"touch that door! Listen to me, do not open that. Why does no-one ever"
333,listen to me? Do I just have a face that nobody listens to? 
334,(Amy goes inside the mystery room.) 
335,"DOCTOR: Again. My screwdriver, where is it? "
336,[Room]
337,
338,"(Dirty, boarded up window, packing boxes.) "
339,"DOCTOR : Silver thing, blue at the end. Where did it go? "
340,AMY: There's nothing here. 
341,DOCTOR: Whatever's there stopped you seeing the room. 
342,[Corridor]
343,
344,DOCTOR: What makes you think you could see it? 
345,[Room]
346,
347,"DOCTOR : Now please, just get out. "
348,"AMY: Silver, blue at the end? "
349,"DOCTOR : My screwdriver, yeah. "
350,AMY: It's here. 
351,[Corridor]
352,
353,DOCTOR: Must have rolled under the door. 
354,[Room]
355,
356,AMY: Yeah. Must have. And then it must have jumped
357,up on the table. 
358,[Corridor]
359,
360,DOCTOR: Get out of there. 
361,[Room]
362,
363,DOCTOR : Get out of there! Get out! 
364,"(Amy picks up the screwdriver, which is nearly stuck to the table with"
365,gunk.) 
366,[Corridor]
367,
368,DOCTOR: Get out of there! 
369,[Room]
370,
371,(Something snake-like with very long sharp teeth
372,slithers down behind Amy.) 
373,DOCTOR : What is it? What are you doing? 
374,"AMY: There's nothing here, but "
375,[Corridor]
376,
377,DOCTOR: Corner of your eye. 
378,[Room]
379,
380,AMY; What is it? 
381,"DOCTOR : Don't try to see it. If it knows you've seen it, it will"
382,kill you. Don't look at it. Do not look. 
383,(Amy turns and finally stares it in the face. She screams.)
384,
385,[Corridor]
386,
387,DOCTOR: Get out! 
388,(Amy runs to the Doctor.) 
389,DOCTOR: Give me that. 
390,"(The Doctor grabs the sonic screwdriver and locks the door, then tries"
391,to free himself.) 
392,DOCTOR: Come on. What's the bad alien done to you? 
393,AMY: Will that door hold it? 
394,"Oh, yeah, yeah, of course. It's an interdimensional multiform from"
395,outer space. They're all terrified of wood. 
396,(There is a bright light in the room.) 
397,AMY: What's that? What's it doing? 
398,DOCTOR: I don't know. Getting dressed? Run. Just go. Your back up's
399,coming. I'll be fine. 
400,AMY: There is no back up. 
401,DOCTOR: I heard you on the radio. You called for back up. 
402,AMY: I was pretending. It's a pretend radio. 
403,DOCTOR: You're a policewoman. 
404,AMY: I'm a kissogram! 
405,(She takes off her cap and her long red hair falls down. The door falls
406,"down to reveal a workman in overalls and toolbelt, with a black"
407,"dog, He looks just like Barney the coma patient.) "
408,AMY: But it's just 
409,"DOCTOR: No, it isn't. Look at the faces. "
410,(The man barks.) 
411,"AMY: What? I'm sorry, but what? "
412,DOCTOR: It's all one creature. One creature disguised as two. Clever
413,"old multi-form. A bit of a rush job, though. Got the voice a bit"
414,"muddled, did you? Mind you, where did you get the pattern from? You'd"
415,"need a psychic link, a live feed. How did you fix that? "
416,"(The coma patient has a photograph of a black dog by his bed, just to"
417,confirm
418,the identification. The man in the corridor opens his mouth to reveal
419,the long needle-like teeth.) 
420,"DOCTOR: Stay, boy! Her and me, we're safe. Want to know why? She sent"
421,for back up. 
422,AMY: I didn't send for back-up! 
423,"DOCTOR: I know. That was a clever lie to save our lives. Okay, yeah, no"
424,"back up. And that's why we're safe. Alone, we're not a threat to you."
425,"If we had back up, you'd have to kill us. "
426,"ATRAXI : Attention, Prisoner Zero. The human residence is"
427,surrounded. Attention Prisoner Zero. The human residence is surrounded.
428,
429,AMY: What's that? 
430,"DOCTOR: Well, that would be back up. Okay, one more time. We do have"
431,back up and that's definitely why we're safe. 
432,ATRAXI [OC}: Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the human
433,residence will be incinerated. 
434,"DOCTOR: Well, safe apart from, you know, incineration. "
435,ATRAXI : Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the human
436,residence will be incinerated. 
437,(The Doctor struggles with the sonic screwdriver.) 
438,"DOCTOR: Come on, work, work, work, come on. "
439,ATRAXI : Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the human
440,residence will be incinerated. 
441,(The Doctor finally frees himself from the handcuffs.) 
442,DOCTOR: Run! Run! 
443,ATRAXI : Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the human
444,residence will be incinerated. 
445,[Garden]
446,
447,DOCTOR: Kissogram? 
448,"AMY: Yes, a kissogram. Work through it. "
449,DOCTOR: Why'd you pretend to be a policewoman? 
450,AMY: You broke into my house. It was this or a French maid. What's
451,going on? Tell me. Tell me! 
452,DOCTOR: An alien convict is hiding in your spare room disguised as a
453,"man and a dog, and some other aliens are about to incinerate your"
454,house. Any questions? 
455,AMY: Yes. 
456,"DOCTOR: Me too. No, no, no, no! Don't do that, not now! It's still"
457,rebuilding. Not letting us in. 
458,ATRAXI : Prisoner Zero will vacate the human residence or the human
459,residence will be incinerated. 
460,AMY: Come on. 
461,"DOCTOR: No, wait, hang on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. The shed. I"
462,destroyed that shed last time I was here. Smashed it to pieces. 
463,AMY: So there's a new one. Let's go. 
464,"DOCTOR: Yeah, but the new one's got old. It's ten years old at least."
465,"Twelve years. I'm not six months late, I'm twelve years late. "
466,AMY: He's coming. 
467,DOCTOR: You said six months. Why did you say six months?

604,"(A black disc covers the sun, like a total eclipse.) "
605,AMY: So what's wrong with the sun?

666,RORY: But he was a story. He was a game. 
667,DOCTOR: Man and dog. Why? Tell me now.

675,RORY: What? There's a Prisoner Zero too? 
676,AMY: Yes. 
677,(One of the pretty eyeball spaceships comes down.)

695,AMY: What do we do now?

711,same minute!

724,"AMY: He had a dog, though. There's a dog in a coma? "

727,good-looking one.

757,"(Six faces come up on the screen, all labelled as above plus ESA and"
758,CSIRO. He shows them his psychic paper.)

760,"MAN : This is a secure call, what are you doing here? "
761,"DOCTOR: Hello. Yeah, I know you should switch me off, but before you"
762,"do, watch this. "
763,"PATRICK MOORE [on screen]: It's here too, I'm getting it. "
764,"DOCTOR: Fermat's Theorem, the proof. And I mean the real one. Never"
765,"been seen before. Poor old Fermat, got killed in a duel before he could"
766,"write it down. My fault. I slept in. Oh, and here's an oldie but a"

774,"tiny bit alive, but don't let on. And why am I writing it on a phone?"
775,"Never mind, you'll find out. Okay, I'm sending this to all your"

779,PATRICK MOORE [on screen]: Who was your lady friend? 
780,"DOCTOR: Patrick, behave. "
781,MAN : What does this virus do? 
782,"DOCTOR: It's a reset command, that's all. It resets counters. It gets"
783,"in the wifi and resets every counter it can find. Clocks, calendars,"
784,anything with a chip will default at zero at exactly the same time. But
785,"yeah, I could be lying, why should you trust me? I'll let my best man"
786,"explain. (sotto) Jeff, you're my best man. "

873,"MOTHER: Time for what, Time Lord? "

878,DOCTOR: Okay. You came to this world by opening a crack in space and
879,time. Do it again. Just leave. 
880,MOTHER: I did not open the crack. 
881,DOCTOR; Somebody did.

891,(The clock says 0:00.) 
892,"DOCTOR; Yeah, I know, just a clock. Whatever. But do you know what's"
893,"happening right now? In one little bedroom, my team are working. Jeff"
894,and the world. And do you know what they're doing? They're spreading
895,"the word all over the world, quantum fast. The word is out. And do you"
896,"know what the word is? The word is Zero. Now, me, if I was up in the"
897,"sky in a battleship, monitoring all Earth"

904,"MOTHER: The Atraxi are limited. While I'm in this form, they'll still"
905,"be unable to detect me. They've tracked a phone, not me. "
906,"DOCTOR: Yeah, but this is the good bit. I mean, this is my favourite"
907,bit. Do you know what this phone is full of? Pictures of you. Every
908,"form you've learned to take, right here. Ooo, and being uploaded about"
909,"now. And the final score is, no Tardis, no screwdriver, two minutes to"
910,"spare. Who da man? Oh, I'm never saying that again. Fine. "
911,MOTHER: Then I shall take a new form. 
912,"DOCTOR: Oh, stop it. You know you can't. It takes months to form that"
913,kind of psychic link. 
914,MOTHER: And I've had years. 
915,(Amy collapses.) 
916,DOCTOR: No! Amy? You've got to hold on. Amy? Don't sleep! You've got to
917,"stay awake, please. "
918,RORY: Doctor. 
919,(Prisoner Zero has transformed into a gangly man with a ripped shirt
920,and floppy hair.) 
921,"DOCTOR: Well, that's rubbish. Who's that supposed to be? "
922,RORY: It's you. 
923,DOCTOR; Me? Is that what I look like? 
924,RORY: You don't know? 
925,"DOCTOR: Busy day. Why me, though? You're linked with her. Why are you"
926,copying me? 
927,(A little girl comes from around a curtain and holds the duplicate's
928,hand.) 
929,AMELIA: I'm not. Poor Amy Pond. Still such a child inside. Dreaming of
930,the magic Doctor she knows will return to save her. What a
931,disappointment you've been. 
932,"DOCTOR: No, she's dreaming about me because she can hear me. Amy, don't"
933,"just hear me, listen. Remember the room, the room in your house you"
934,"couldn't see. Remember you went inside. I tried to stop, but you did."
935,"You went in the room. You went inside. Amy, dream about what you saw. "
936,AMELIA: No. No. No! 
937,(She transforms.) 
938,"DOCTOR: Well done, Prisoner Zero. A perfect impersonation of yourself. "
939,ATRAXI : Prisoner Zero is located. Prisoner Zero is restrained. 
940,"ZERO: Silence, Doctor. Silence will fall. "
941,(Prisoner Zero disappears in a rush of wind.) 
942,"RORY: The sun. It's back to normal, right? That's, that's good, yeah?"
943,That means it's over. 
944,(Amy wakes up.) 
945,RORY: Amy. Are you okay? Are you with us? 
946,AMY: What happened? 
947,RORY: He did it. The Doctor did it. 
948,"DOCTOR: No, I didn't. "
949,RORY: What are you doing? 
950,DOCTOR: Tracking the signal back. Sorry in advance. 
951,RORY: About what? 
952,DOCTOR: The bill. 
953,(The Doctor phones the Atraxi.) 
954,"DOCTOR: Oi, I didn't say you could go! Article fifty seven of the"
955,"Shadow Proclamation. This is a fully established level five planet, and"
956,you were going to burn it? What? Did you think no-one was watching? You
957,"lot, back here, now. Okay, now I've done it. "
958,RORY: Did he just bring them back? Did he just save the world from
959,aliens and then bring all the aliens back again? 
960,[Hospital corridor]
961,
962,AMY: Where are you going? 
963,"DOCTOR: The roof. No, hang on. "
964,[Doctor's locker room]
965,
966,AMY; What's in here? 
967,DOCTOR: I'm saving the world - I need a decent shirt. To hell with the
968,raggedy. Time to put on a show. 
969,"RORY: You just summoned aliens back to Earth. Actual aliens, deadly"
970,"aliens, aliens of death, and now you're taking your clothes off. Amy,"
971,he's taking his clothes off. 
972,DOCTOR: Turn your back if it embarrasses you. 
973,"RORY: Are you stealing clothes now? Those clothes belong to people, you"
974,know. (to Amy) Are you not going to turn your back? 
975,AMY: No. 
976,[Roof]
977,
978,(The Doctor walks out in a new shirt with several
979,ties draped around his neck. The Atraxi is hovering overhead.) 
980,"AMY: So this was a good idea, was it? They were leaving. "
981,"DOCTOR: Leaving is good. Never coming back is better. Come on, then!"
982,The Doctor will see you now. 
983,(The eyeball drops onto the roof and scans the Doctor.) 
984,ATRAXI: You are not of this world. 
985,"DOCTOR: No, but I've put a lot of work into it. "
986,(He looks at his selection of ties.) 
987,"DOCTOR: Oh, hmm, I don't know. What do you think? "
988,ATRAXI: Is this world important? 
989,"DOCTOR: Important? What's that mean, important? Six billion people live"
990,here. Is that important? Here's a better question. Is this world a
991,"threat to the Atraxi? Well, come on. You're monitoring the whole"
992,planet. Is this world a threat? 
993,(There is a projection of the world between them.) 
994,ATRAXI: No. 
995,DOCTOR: Are the peoples of this world guilty of any crime by the laws
996,of the Atraxi? 
997,ATRAXI: No. 
998,DOCTOR: Okay. One more. Just one. Is this world protected? Because
999,"you're not the first lot to come here. Oh, there have been so many. "
1000,(The projection shows the Daleks et al.) 
1001,"DOCTOR: And what you've got to ask is, what happened to them? "
1002,"(A run through of all the previous Doctors, then this Doctor steps"
1003,through the projection with a jacket and bow tie.) 
1004,"DOCTOR: Hello. I'm the Doctor. Basically, run. "
1005,"(The eyeball zooms back to its ship and leaves, very fast. There is a"
1006,"brief materialisation sound, then the Doctor takes a glowing Tardis key"
1007,out of his new jacket pocket.) 
1008,AMY: Is that it? Is that them gone for good? Who were they? 
1009,(The Doctor is already down the stairs and running out of the
1010,hospital.)
1011,
1012,[Garden]
1013,
1014,(The Tardis is waiting for him.) 
1015,"DOCTOR: Okay, what have you got for me this time? "
1016,[Tardis]
1017,
1018,"DOCTOR: Look at you. Oh, you sexy thing! Look at"
1019,you. 
1020,(Amy and Rory run up just at it dematerialises. 
1021,Night time. The sound of the Tardis wakes Amy up. She runs outside.) 
1022,DOCTOR: Sorry about running off earlier. Brand new Tardis. Bit
1023,exciting. Just had a quick hop to the moon and back to run her in.
1024,She's ready for the big stuff now. 
1025,AMY: It's you. You came back. 
1026,DOCTOR: Course I came back. I always come back. Something wrong with
1027,that? 
1028,AMY: And you kept the clothes. 
1029,"DOCTOR: Well, I just saved the world. The whole planet, for about the"
1030,"millionth time, no charge. Yeah, shoot me. I kept the clothes. "
1031,AMY: Including the bow tie. 
1032,"DOCTOR: Yeah, it's cool. Bow ties are cool. "
1033,AMY: Are you from another planet? 
1034,DOCTOR: Yeah. 
1035,AMY: Okay. 
1036,DOCTOR: So what do you think? 
1037,AMY: Of what? 
1038,DOCTOR: Other planets. Want to check some out? 
1039,AMY: What does that mean? 
1040,"DOCTOR: It means. Well, it means come with me. "
1041,AMY: Where? 
1042,DOCTOR: Wherever you like. 
1043,"AMY: All that stuff that happened. The hospital, the spaceships,"
1044,Prisoner Zero. 
1045,"DOCTOR: Oh, don't worry, that's just the beginning. There's loads more."
1046,
1047,"AMY: Yeah, but those things, those amazing things, all that stuff. That"
1048,was two years ago. 
1049,DOCTOR: Oh.! Oops. 
1050,AMY: Yeah. 
1051,DOCTOR: So that's 
1052,AMY: Fourteen years! 
1053,"DOCTOR: Fourteen years since fish custard. Amy Pond, the girl who"
1054,"waited, you've waited long enough. "
1055,"AMY: When I was a kid, you said there was a swimming pool and a"
1056,"library, and the swimming pool was in the library. "
1057,"DOCTOR: Yeah. Not sure where it's got to now. It'll turn up. So,"
1058,coming? 
1059,AMY: No. 
1060,DOCTOR: You wanted to come fourteen years ago. 
1061,AMY: I grew up. 
1062,DOCTOR: Don't worry. I'll soon fix that. 
1063,(He opens the Tardis door and follows Amy in.) 
1064,[Tardis]
1065,
1066,DOCTOR: Well? Anything you want to say? Any passing
1067,remarks? I've heard them all. 
1068,AMY: I'm in my nightie. 
1069,"DOCTOR: Oh, don't worry. Plenty of clothes in the wardrobe. And"
1070,"possibly a swimming pool. So, all of time and space, everything that"
1071,ever happened or ever will Where do you want to start? 
1072,AMY: You are so sure that I'm coming. 
1073,"DOCTOR: Yeah, I am. "
1074,AMY: Why? 
1075,"DOCTOR: Cause you're the Scottish girl in the English village, and I"
1076,know how that feels. 
1077,"AMY: Oh, do you? "
1078,"DOCTOR: All these years living here, most of your life, and you've"
1079,"still got that accent. Yeah, you're coming. "
1080,AMY: Can you get me back for tomorrow morning? 
1081,"DOCTOR: It's a time machine. I can get you back five minutes ago. Why,"
1082,what's tomorrow? 
1083,"AMY: Nothing. Nothing. Just you know, stuff. "
1084,"DOCTOR: All right, then. Back in time for stuff. "
1085,(A sonic screwdriver rises from a slot in the console.) 
1086,"DOCTOR: Oh! A new one! Lovely. Thanks, dear. "
1087,(The Doctor uses an old typewriter wired into the console.) 
1088,AMY: Why me? 
1089,DOCTOR: Why not? 
1090,"AMY: No, seriously. You are asking me to run away with you in the"
1091,middle of the night. It's a fair question. Why me? 
1092,DOCTOR: I don't know. Fun. Do I have to have a reason? 
1093,AMY: People always have a reason. 
1094,DOCTOR: Do I look like people? 
1095,AMY; Yes. 
1096,"DOCTOR: Been knocking around on my own for a while. My choice, but I've"
1097,started talking to myself all the time. It's giving me earache. 
1098,AMY: You're lonely. That's it? Just that? 
1099,DOCTOR: Just that. Promise. 
1100,AMY: Okay. 
1101,"DOCTOR: So, are you okay, then? Because this place, sometimes it can"
1102,"make people feel a bit, you know. "
1103,"AMY: I'm fine. It's just, there's a whole world in here, just like you"
1104,"said. It's all true. I thought. Well, I started to think that maybe you"
1105,were just like a madman with a box. 
1106,"DOCTOR: Amy Pond, there's something you'd better understand about me,"
1107,"because it's important, and one day your life may depend on it. I am"
1108,"definitely a madman with a box. Ha ha! Yeah. Goodbye Leadworth, hello"
1109,everything. 
1110,"(He sets the Tardis in flight. We watch it dematerialise in the garden,"
1111,then we go back to Amy's bedroom with the wedding dress and its veil
1112,hanging up on the back of the door.)
