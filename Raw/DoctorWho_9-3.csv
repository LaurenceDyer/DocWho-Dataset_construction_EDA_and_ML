20,One 
21, [SS Pevensey Castle]
22,
23, (There are screams outside the radio room. A
24,crewman dashes in and starts broadcasting.) 
25,CREWMAN: Mayday. Mayday. SS 
26, [Naval base radio room]
27,
28, CREWMAN : Pevensey Castle. We're being
29,attacked! 
30,"BOWMAN: Give your position, please. Give your position. "
31,"(The base commander, Captain Hart, enters from outside the complex as"
32,Bowman tries to listen through the static.) 
33,HART: What is it? 
34,"BOWMAN: It's a Mayday, sir. SS Pevensey Castle, they say they're being"
35,attacked.
36,
37, [SS Pevensey Castle]
38,
39, CREWMAN: We're abandoning ship! We're abandoning
40,ship! Our position is 
41,(A scaly hand takes the microphone. The crewman backs away then
42,screams.)
43,
44, [Boat]
45,
46, (The Doctor and Jo are being ferried to a small
47,island in an even smaller boat.) 
48,ROBBINS: That's it over there. 
49,(The Doctor looks through a pair of binoculars at what is really Norris
50,Castle on the Isle of Wight.) 
51,"DOCTOR: There you are, Jo. That's the Master's permanent residence from"
52,now on. 
53,"JO: Well, let's hope he's still there."
54,
55, [Quay]
56,
57, (They moor up and walk along the jetty.) 
58,DOCTOR: Okay. 
59,ROBBINS: I'll be back in a couple of hours to take you over to the
60,mainland. 
61,DOCTOR: Right. 
62,(Robbins wheels a small motorbike while the Doctor and Jo get into a
63,stripped out Citroen 2CV with no doors.)
64,
65, [Governor's office]
66,
67," (In the castle, an older man picks up the internal"
68,telephone.) 
69,TRENCHARD: Yes? 
70,"BARCLAY : Main gate. Two visitors for the prisoner, sir, from UNIT."
71,"Passes all in order, sir. "
72,"TRENCHARD: Right, send them up. "
73,(The Doctor and Jo are let in through the gate and showed up to the
74,office by an armed guard. Trenchard is working at his desk.) 
75,"DOCTOR: Well, I suppose we could always come back later, "
76,"TRENCHARD: Oh, yes, of course. You'll be the chappie from UNIT. "
77,JO: My name's Josephine Grant. How do you do? And this is the Doctor. 
78,TRENCHARD: Colonel Trenchard. Delighted to meet you. Pleasant trip? 
79,"DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. "
80,"TRENCHARD: You're late, you know? "
81,"JO: Yes, we were held up. "
82,"TRENCHARD: Mmm, thought you might have sunk without trace. "
83,JO: Sunk? 
84,TRENCHARD: Happens all the time recently. 
85,DOCTOR: What does? 
86,"(Trenchard gives a piece of paper to the guard, who leaves with it.) "
87,"TRENCHARD: Ships vanishing. Makes you think, doesn't it? "
88,DOCTOR: It does indeed. 
89,"TRENCHARD: Now then, passes? "
90,"DOCTOR: Well, look, we've been through all that, actually. "
91,TRENCHARD: We don't take any chances here. Let's see them. 
92,(Jo hands them over.) 
93,"TRENCHARD: Oh. Ah, yes, from UNIT. "
94,"DOCTOR: That's right, yes. "
95,"TRENCHARD: Yes. Ah, jolly good. Well, you'll be wanting to see the"
96,prisoner. 
97,DOCTOR: That was the general idea. 
98,"TRENCHARD: He's an interesting chap, you know. You'll enjoy talking to"
99,him. 
100,DOCTOR: If ever I get the opportunity. Has he given you any trouble as
101,yet? 
102,TRENCHARD: Not a bit. 
103,JO: You've got to be joking! He must have tried to escape? 
104,"TRENCHARD: You've seen our security precautions. Anyway, we're on an"
105,island. 
106,"DOCTOR: Has he tried to hypnotise any of the guards, by any chance? "
107,TRENCHARD: He couldn't. All our men are completely immune to hypnotism.
108,
109,JO: How can you be so sure? 
110,TRENCHARD: Prove it to you. (into intercom) Trenchard here. Send that
111,"new man, Wilson, in to see the prisoner. Now then, come over here and"
112,take a look into this screen. 
113,(The monitor shows the Master sitting and reading.) 
114,"DOCTOR: My word, he's putting on weight. "
115,"TRENCHARD: Poor chap, he can't get the exercise. Now then, watch."
116,
117, [The Master's cell]
118,
119, (Closer to a hotel room than a prison cell. There
120,are even some carvings for decoration. The guard enters.) 
121,"WILSON: Mister Trenchard sent me, sir, to see if you wanted your book"
122,changed. 
123,"MASTER: Well, that's very kind of him, but I haven't quite finished"
124,yet. 
125,"WILSON: Right you are, sir. "
126,"MASTER: Just a minute. You're new here, aren't you? "
127,"WILSON: Arrived yesterday, sir. "
128,MASTER: Wait. Do you know who I am? 
129,WILSON: You're the prisoner. 
130,MASTER: I am the Master. Come here. 
131,"(Wilson walks towards the Master, who rises to look him in the eyes.) "
132,MASTER: I am the Master and you will obey me. You understand? You will
133,obey me. 
134,"WILSON: You'll let us know when you've finished with the book, sir? "
135,(Wilson leaves.)
136,
137, [Governor's office]
138,
139, TRENCHARD: You see? 
140,"DOCTOR: Yes, very impressive. Perhaps we could see him now, yes? "
141,"TRENCHARD: Certainly. This way. After you, my dear."
142,
143, [The Master's cell]
144,
145,(Trenchard leads the way along a corridor to the
146,cell and enters. The Master is now working out on a rowing machine.) 
147,TRENCHARD: Visitors for you. 
148,"MASTER: Why, Doctor! And Miss Grant! What a very pleasant surprise. "
149,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, how are you? "
150,"MASTER: Well, as you see, very well. Trying to keep fit. "
151,"TRENCHARD: Yes, well, I'll leave you all together. Give the guard a"
152,shout when you want to leave. 
153,"DOCTOR: Thank you, Colonel. "
154,(Trenchard leaves.) 
155,"MASTER: He's quite a decent sort, really. Used to be the Governor of a"
156,"colony once, so he tells me. "
157,"DOCTOR: Very small colony, wasn't it? In fact, I believe they claimed"
158,independence soon after he arrived. 
159,JO: He seems to be looking after you very well. 
160,"MASTER: Oh, yes, I've got everything I want, except, of course, my"
161,freedom. 
162,DOCTOR: You can consider yourself lucky. Quite a few people were in
163,favour of having you executed. 
164,"MASTER: My dear Doctor, don't think I'm not grateful. I've had a chance"
165,to think about things while I've been in here. 
166,DOCTOR: Have you now? 
167,MASTER: I wish that something like this had happened a long time ago. 
168,JO: Surely you don't like being locked up? 
169,"MASTER: No, but, it's given me a chance to reconsider my life. "
170,DOCTOR: Am I to take it that you're a changed man? 
171,(The Master washes his hands in the en-suite.) 
172,"MASTER: Is that so very incredible? After all, I do have a great deal"
173,of which to repent. 
174,JO: You're telling us. 
175,"DOCTOR: In that case, perhaps you'd like to tell me the whereabouts of"
176,your Tardis? 
177,"MASTER: So that you could use it in order to escape from this planet,"
178,Doctor? 
179,"DOCTOR: No, so that I can make absolutely certain that you can't. "
180,"MASTER: No, I'm sorry. That is too much to ask. "
181,"DOCTOR: Ask a silly question. Come on, Jo. I think we'd better be"
182,going. Is there anything that I can do for you at all? 
183,MASTER: There is one thing. Please come in now and then to have a chat.
184,"Oh, Trenchard's a very nice man, but his conversation is somewhat"
185,limited. 
186,JO: Goodbye. 
187,"MASTER: Goodbye, Miss Grant. And goodbye, Doctor. I sincerely hope we"
188,meet again very soon. 
189,"(The Doctor nearly shakes the Master's hand, but turns the gesture into"
190,a wave.) 
191,DOCTOR: Goodbye. 
192,"(The Master gets back on his rowing machine, laughing.)"
193,
194, [Governor's office]
195,
196, JO: Doctor? 
197,DOCTOR: Mmm? 
198,"JO: You felt sorry for him, didn't you. You wanted to come down here"
199,and see that was all right. 
200,"DOCTOR: Well, he used to be a friend of mine once. A very good friend."
201,"In fact, you might almost say we were at school together. "
202,JO: How long's he going to be here? 
203,"DOCTOR: Forever, I should think. "
204,(Trenchard enters.) 
205,"TRENCHARD: Ah, ready for off, then? I'd better stamp your passes. "
206,"DOCTOR: What, again? "
207,"TRENCHARD: Got to be checked in and out, old man. It's the rule. Well,"
208,"we don't look after him too badly, do we? "
209,"DOCTOR: No, indeed. But I advise you to be careful. He's a very"
210,dangerous man. 
211,"TRENCHARD: Ah, don't worry. I keep my eye on him. There you are, my"
212,dear. Come along now then. 
213,JO: Thank you. 
214,TRENCHARD: I'll get one of my chaps to run you down to the quayside. 
215,DOCTOR: Thank you.
216,
217, [The Master's cell]
218,
219, (Trenchard enters. The Master is doing a
220,"crossword. Times, probably.) "
221,"TRENCHARD: There we are, then. Fooled them nicely, didn't we? "
222,MASTER: I hope so. 
223,"TRENCHARD: What about that hypnotism wheeze, eh? That took them in. "
224,MASTER: Don't underestimate the Doctor. Do you really believe that he
225,came here to see me? 
226,(The Master takes a dictionary from a bookcase to help with his
227,crossword.) 
228,TRENCHARD: Why else? 
229,"MASTER: Vanishing ships, of course. "
230,"TRENCHARD: Oh, I don't think so. No, he didn't seem particularly"
231,interested when I mentioned it. 
232,MASTER: You did what! 
233,"TRENCHARD: We were just chatting. No harm done, surely. "
234,"MASTER: Let's hope not. By the way, what about those admiralty charts I"
235,asked for? 
236,TRENCHARD: They'll be here this afternoon. 
237,"MASTER: Ah, splendid. Er, there is one more thing. "
238,TRENCHARD: Yes? 
239,"MASTER: I wonder, do you think I could have another television set? For"
240,the bedroom. 
241,"TRENCHARD: Yes. Yes, I'm sure that's possible. "
242,"MASTER: Colour, of course. "
243,"TRENCHARD: Of course! Well, if you'll excuse me?"
244,
245, [Quay]
246,
247," ROBBINS: Ah, it's true. Three ships vanished."
248,Something queer going on for all their trying to hush it up. 
249,"DOCTOR: Well, who's trying to hush it up? "
250,"ROBBINS: Well, them over at the naval base. The secret research"
251,establishment. 
252,DOCTOR: You seem to know a great deal about all this. 
253,"ROBBINS: Well, I'm in the lifeboat crew, aren't I? We went out to look"
254,"for survivors. Only found the one lifeboat, capsized. The bottom was"
255,all charred in a sort of pattern. 
256,"DOCTOR: Well, where's this boat now? "
257,"ROBBINS: Ah, the navy took it. Told us to keep our mouths shut. "
258,"DOCTOR: Well, where's this naval base, then? "
259,ROBBINS: Over beyond the headland. 
260,"DOCTOR: Right, well, perhaps you'd like to take me there straight away."
261,
262,ROBBINS: Mister Trenchard paid me to bring you out here and take you
263,"back. You want to go over to the naval base, then you make your own"
264,arrangements. 
265,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, you're probably perfectly right. Look, er, I wonder"
266,whether you'd like to go and see what's happening to my young friend?
267,She said she was going to buy some picture postcards. 
268,(The Doctor holds up a note of the realm.) 
269,ROBBINS: I don't mind. 
270,"DOCTOR: I'd go myself, only my bad leg's playing me up a bit. The"
271,"Crimea, you know. "
272,ROBBINS: I see. Crimea? 
273,"DOCTOR: Oh, Gallipoli? El Alamein? Does it really matter? "
274,ROBBINS: I reckon not. 
275,"(Robbins takes the money and leaves. The Doctor unties the little boat,"
276,starts up the engine and chugs away.)
277,
278, [Hart's office]
279,
280," (At HMS Seaspite Naval Research Establishment,"
281,"Captain Hart is giving dictation to his secretary, a young Wren.) "
282,HART: And I regret to inform your Lordships that our investigations
283,"have failed to reveal any clue as to the cause of the sinkings, full"
284,stop. The charred ship's lifeboat will be sent to our laboratory at HMS
285,"Vernon Portsmouth for investigation and analysis. Meanwhile, we are"
286,keeping careful watch. 
287,"BLYTHE: Yes, sir? "
288,HART: Come and look at this. What on Earth? 
289,(The Doctor is steering the boat up onto the beach.) 
290,"BLYTHE: Perhaps he's lost, sir. "
291,HART: This place is supposed to be top secret. People treating it like
292,Brighton beach. 
293,(Hart picks up a telephone.) 
294,HART: Get me the Master at Arms. Captain Hart here. I don't know
295,whether you've noticed but there happens to be a stray civilian
296,"chugging into the base! Get on to it, will you? "
297,"BLYTHE: Sir, he's making straight for the lifeboat!"
298,
299, [Naval base beach]
300,
301, (The Doctor crunches his way over the shingle to
302,an upturned boat and gets out his magnifying glass to examine the burn
303,marks.) 
304,M-A-A: Oy! You! 
305,(The Master at Arms leads five armed ratings at the double.) 
306,DOCTOR: Good afternoon. I wonder whether I could see your commanding
307,officer?
308,
309, [Quay]
310,
311, (Jo gives Robbins a ten pound note.) 
312,"ROBBINS: Thank you, Miss. "
313,(Robbins gives Jo his motorcycle helmet.) 
314,"ROBBINS: Look after it for me, won't you? "
315,JO: Don't worry. I'll bring it back just as soon as I've found the
316,Doctor. 
317,(Jo rides off on his motorcycle.)
318,
319, [The Master's cell]
320,
321, (The Master's television set is like Trenchard's
322,"monitor, set into the wall. He switches it on and there is the episode"
323,of the Clangers where they find a probe has landed on their planet. The
324,Master whistles along with the puppets. Trenchard enters.) 
325,TRENCHARD: What are you watching? 
326,MASTER: It seems to be a rather interesting extra-terrestrial life
327,form. 
328,"TRENCHARD: Only puppets, you know? For children. "
329,MASTER: Oh. 
330,(The Master turns off the television.) 
331,"TRENCHARD: Well, here's the chart you wanted. "
332,"MASTER: Oh, good! "
333,(The Master spreads the chart on the table.) 
334,MASTER: That's right. Thank you. Now. 
335,(The Master plots points on the chart.) 
336,"MASTER: You know, Trenchard, a man of your efficiency is really wasted"
337,in a job like this. 
338,"TRENCHARD: Huh, bit of a comedown in a way, I suppose, but "
339,MASTER: Never mind. Once our plan succeeds people will really begin to
340,realise your true worth. 
341,TRENCHARD: Ah. What are you doing? 
342,MASTER: I've just been plotting the sightings of the three sinkings.
343,"There, there and there. And it's interesting that right in the middle"
344,"of them, there's this abandoned sea fort. "
345,(The marked Fort is just off Fortress Island.) 
346,"TRENCHARD: Not abandoned any more, old chap. "
347,MASTER: Really? 
348,TRENCHARD: Hart's people are going to use it as a sonar testing
349,station. Contractors are working on the place now. 
350,MASTER: Hmm.
351,
352, [Sea Fort crew room]
353,
354, (Inside No Man's Land Sea Fort in the middle of
355,"the Solent, two men are playing cards and drinking from cans.) "
356,HICKMAN: How much to see you? 
357,CLARK: A fiver. 
358,HICKMAN: Right. 
359,CLARK: Full house. Kings on twos. 
360,"HICKMAN: Oh, that's marvellous, innit. Just marvellous. "
361,"CLARK: Come on, it's not your life savings, it's only a couple of quid."
362,I'll give you a chance to get your own back. 
363,"HICKMAN: Ah, forget it. "
364,CLARK: What's the matter with you? 
365,"HICKMAN: I don't know. Being stuck out here, I suppose. "
366,CLARK: It's not so bad. Are you sure you don't want another game? 
367,"HICKMAN: Do you know, there's something funny about this place. "
368,CLARK: Share the joke. 
369,"HICKMAN: Well, the place is deserted, right? "
370,CLARK: So? 
371,HICKMAN: Just the two of us on maintenance? 
372,CLARK: Right. 
373,HICKMAN: Yet I keep getting the feeling I'm being watched. 
374,(Possibly by the owner of the scaly hand reaching over a hatch ledge.)
375,
376, [Outside Hart's office]
377,
378," HART: If you are from UNIT, then where are your"
379,credentials? 
380,DOCTOR: I never carry the things. A lot of bureaucratic nonsense. If
381,"you wish to see my pass, then ask Miss Grant."
382,
383,[Hart's office]
384,
385, HART: Why didn't you arrange for an official visit
386,through normal channels? 
387,"DOCTOR: Well, I just dropped in purely on impulse, old chap. As soon as"
388,"I heard about that charred lifeboat, I had to see it. "
389,HART: Oh? Why? 
390,DOCTOR: You've inspected the boat yourself? 
391,"HART: Well, of course I have. "
392,DOCTOR: Then you must have noticed the linear nature of those scorch
393,"marks. Excuse me, my dear. May I? "
394,(The Doctor takes Blythe's shorthand pad and pencil.) 
395,"DOCTOR: Now then, sit down. Now, the marks are a very definite shape, a"
396,"linear shape like this. Now, how do you account for that? "
397,(The Doctor draws a series of wavy lines on the pad.) 
398,HART: A freak affect if the ship caught fire. 
399,"DOCTOR: Yes, but it didn't catch fire. If it had, the smoke and flames"
400,"would have been seen, wouldn't they? "
401,"HART: All right then, how do you account for them? "
402,"DOCTOR: A concentrated beam of heat, applied from underneath the boat"
403,whilst it was still in the water. 
404,HART: Deliberately to sink a lifeboat? 
405,"DOCTOR: Yes, to make sure there were no survivors. What are these"
406,markers here? 
407,HART: Those are the last known positions of the missing vessels so far
408,as we can estimate. 
409,(Blythe answers the telephone.) 
410,"BLYTHE: Captain Hart's office? Yes. Yes, I see. Hold on. There's a"
411,young lady here with two UNIT passes. She wants to know if there's
412,anyone here called the Doctor?
413,
414, [Sea Fort crew room]
415,
416," CLARK: Come on, you can't lose anything at"
417,draughts. 
418,HICKMAN: There's a jinx on this place. Nothing but trouble since we
419,started repairing the foundations. 
420,CLARK: Forget it. It's not your problem. Black or white? 
421,(There is a noise outside.) 
422,HICKMAN: What's that noise? 
423,CLARK: It's a mermaid. She can't resist us. 
424,HICKMAN: Shut up! There's someone moving about upstairs. 
425,CLARK: It's the wind. 
426,HICKMAN: Fat load of use you are. 
427,(Hickman loads a flare gun.) 
428,CLARK: What are you doing there? Going to send up a distress signal? 
429,HICKMAN: You never know. 
430,(Hickman leaves. He climbs a short ladder to a walkway. Then Clark
431,hears a scream.) 
432,CLARK: Hickman! Hickman?
433,
434, [Sea Fort]
435,
436,(Clark climbs the same ladder.) 
437,"CLARK: Hickman, where are you? "
438,"(Clark finds Hickman lying on a concrete slab, staring at nothing."
439,There is something nearby.)
440,
441, [Hart's office]
442,
443," HART: Yes, well, these passes appear to be in"
444,order. You may go. 
445,"DOCTOR: Go? My dear chap, I don't want to go. I want to visit this fort"
446,here. 
447,HART: That fort is being converted for use as a testing station.
448,There's nobody there but a couple of maintenance workmen. 
449,"DOCTOR: Nevertheless, it is right in the centre of all the trouble,"
450,"isn't it? Now if some of your naval bods could get me out there,"
451,Captain? 
452,"HART: Doctor, I have no authority to provide naval vessels for your"
453,pleasure jaunts. 
454,"DOCTOR: Look, don't you realise how important this is? "
455,HART: I realise only too well. Three ships have been sunk and many
456,"lives have been lost. Now, if you don't mind? "
457,"JO: Doctor, I think he wants us to go. "
458,HART: I suggest that you take your theories along to your own people at
459,UNIT and put the whole thing on an official level. 
460,"DOCTOR: If Horatio Nelson had been in charge of this operation, I"
461,hardly think that he would have waited for official instructions. 
462,"HART: Yes, a pretty impulsive fellow, if one can believe the history"
463,books. 
464,"DOCTOR: History books? Captain Hart, Horatio Nelson was a personal"
465,"friend of mine. Come on, Jo. "
466,HART: Good grief. Poor chap's as mad as a hatter.
467,
468, [Boat]
469,
470, JO: How do we get onto the fort? 
471,"DOCTOR: Up that ladder. Now hold tight, Jo. We're coming alongside now."
472,
473,(Jo gets on to the ladder first and they climb up past the MOD property
474,No Landing sign.)
475,
476, [Sea Fort]
477,
478, (The Doctor and Jo walk down a metal staircase.) 
479,JO: I still say you should have taken Mister Robbin's boat back. 
480,"DOCTOR: We will, Jo, we will. And we'll take his motor bicycle back at"
481,"the same time. Still, now we're here, let's take a look around, shall"
482,we? 
483,(A scaly green hand reaches over the side of the boat.)

486,
487," DOCTOR: Well, somebody's here all right. "
488,"JO: But where? Where are they, then? "
489,"DOCTOR: This is a big fort, Jo. They must be in some other part of it."
490,"Come on, we'll find them."
491,
492, [Sea Fort]
493,
494," (As smoke is pours out of Robbin's boat, the"
495,Doctor and Jo go exploring.) 
496,DOCTOR: There are supposed to be two workmen on this thing. They can't
497,just have vanished. 
498,"JO: Well, they have, haven't they? Look, Doctor, it's getting dark."
499,Let's get out of here. 
500,DOCTOR: There's plenty of time. 
501,(KaBOOM! They look out of a nearby window at a floating life belt and
502,Robbins' boat for hire notice.) 
503,DOCTOR: It must have been the petrol tank. 
504,"JO: But it wouldn't just blow up by itself. Doctor, do you realise"
505,we're stranded here! 
506,"DOCTOR: Don't worry, Jo. There must be a radio on this fort somewhere."
507,We'll just have to get a message back to shore. Come on. 
508,(A bipedal turtle-faced reptile comes out of the shadows to watch them
509,go. The Doctor and Jo go up that short ladder.) 
510,JO: Look! 
511,DOCTOR: What is it? 
512,(It is Hickman.) 
513,"DOCTOR: He's dead, poor chap. "
514,"JO: Oh, Doctor, let's get out of here, please. "
515,DOCTOR: All right. Let's find that radio first. 
516,"JO: Shush, listen. "
517,"(Heavy breathing, and something is approaching.) "
518,JO: It's coming towards us!

522,
523, (It is Clark armed with a wrench. He raises it to
524,attack.) 
525,DOCTOR: Stop! We're friends! Stop! 
526,(The Doctor grabs Clark's arm and makes him drop the wrench.) 
527,CLARK: Hickman! He's dead! They killed him! Came from the sea. The sea.
528,A sea devil! 
529,"DOCTOR: Come on, Jo, quick. Give me a hand. "
530,JO: It's all right. 
531,DOCTOR: We've got to get him into that cabin. 
532,(Jo and the Doctor half-carry Clark back the way they came.) 
533,CLARK: Hickman. 
534,DOCTOR: Come on. All right. 
535,CLARK: Monster. 
536,DOCTOR: Yes. 
537,CLARK: Sea devil. 
538,"DOCTOR: Now, easy. "
539,CLARK: Hickman. 
540,(The reptile watches them go.)
541,
542, [Sea Fort crew room]
543,
544, CLARK: The sea monster. 
545,"DOCTOR: Yeah, come on, don't worry. Get yourself down here. "
546,(Clark lies down on the lower bunk bed.) 
547,DOCTOR: That's right. Mind your head. Mind yourself. 
548,JO: That's it. 
549,CLARK: Hickman. 
550,JO: Shush. 
551,"DOCTOR: Where's your radio? The radio, where is it? "
552,(Clark points across the room.) 
553,DOCTOR: Over here? 
554,CLARK: Hickman. 
555,JO: Shush. 
556,CLARK: Ripped it out. They took it away. 
557,"DOCTOR: Yes, they certainly did. "
558,(The Doctor opens the First Aid box.) 
559,CLARK: Devil. Sea monster. Monster. 
560,"JO: Yes, yes, yes. "
561,"DOCTOR: Now, listen to me Take this swab, Jo. Swab his arm. Now, are"
562,there are more transmitters on this fort? 
563,"CLARK: No, nothing. "
564,"DOCTOR: Any transistor radios, that sort of thing? "
565,CLARK: I think so. The crew's quarters. The crew. 
566,JO: What do you want to do? Listen to Night Ride?
567,(A popular BBC Radio 2 show.) 
568,"DOCTOR: It is possible to turn a receiver into a transmitter, you know."
569,
570,JO: It is? 
571,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's simply a matter of modulating the signal. You connect"
572,the output of your loudspeaker into the input of your low frequency
573,"amplifier, then you connect the output of your low frequency amplifier"
574,into your oscillator. You use your loudspeaker as a microphone and
575,there you are. 
576,(The Doctor fills a hypodermic with liquid.) 
577,JO: Ah. 
578,"DOCTOR: Now, where exactly are these transistor radios? "
579,"CLARK: Crew's quarters, down the corridor, next deck. "
580,"DOCTOR: All right. Thank you. Now don't worry, this is not going to"
581,hurt you. All right? Now you'll soon be all right. 
582,CLARK: Hickman. 
583,"DOCTOR: Soon feel better. Look after him, will you, Jo? "
584,"JO: Yes. Shush. Come on now, try and relax. Come on. That's it."

586, [Sea Fort]
587,
588, (The Doctor and a reptile startle each other.) 
589,DOCTOR: Don't be alarmed. I've no wish to harm you. 
590,(The reptile raises its 'hand' which is holding a disc-like device.) 
591,"DOCTOR: Now, wait. We must talk. "
592,(A bolt of red energy just misses the Doctor as he ducks. The Doctor
593,runs up the staircase and the reptile follows. The chase goes up and
594,down ladders.)
595,
596, [Sea Fort crew room]
597,
598, JO: How do you feel now? Would you like a nice hot
599,"cup of tea with some sugar, hmm? "
600,(The Doctor runs in and bolts the door.) 
601,JO: What are you doing? 
602,(The Doctor drags the table over to bar the door.) 
603,DOCTOR: Wire? 
604,(The Doctor find the end of a long wire and goes over to the junction
605,box.) 
606,JO: What is going on? 
607,"DOCTOR: Just as I thought. Reptiles, like those creatures in the caves."
608,"It's completely hostile. Here, hang on to this. Tight! Hang on. "
609,JO: Right. 
610,(The other end of the wire has crocodile clips.) 
611,"JO: Well, now what are you doing? "
612,(The Doctor fastens the clips to the door bolts then returns to the
613,junction box.) 
614,"DOCTOR: Those creatures can cut through anything. Rock, metal,"
615,anything. 
616,JO: Look! 
617,(The metal door is starting to melt. A green hand reaches through the
618,hole and gropes for the bolts. The Doctor throws the power switch and
619,"it screams, pulling its hand back. He turns the power off again.) "
620,DOCTOR: Come on. Give me a hand. 
621,(The Doctor pulls the table back and unbolts the door.) 
622,JO: Where are we going? 
623,"DOCTOR: We've got to get after that creature. Now, come on. "
624,(They chase it through the fort until it jumps out of a broken window
625,into the sea.)

627, [Hart's office]
628,
629,(WRNS Blythe is on the phone.) 
630,BLYTHE: Keep trying. 
631,(Hart enters.) 
632,"HART: Morning, Blythe. "
633,"BLYTHE: Good morning, sir. "
634,HART: Anything in? 
635,"BLYTHE: We've had this report from the civilian police, sir. That man"
636,"who was here yesterday trying to get over to the fort, seems to have"
637,disappeared with the boat he came in. 
638,"HART: Oh, no. "
639,BLYTHE: He and the girl were seen heading out to sea yesterday
640,afternoon. There's been no sign of them since. 
641,"HART: Well, get onto the fort and see if they've wound up there. "
642,"BLYTHE: I've already done that, sir. The fort just wasn't answering. I"
643,can't raise them at all. 
644,"HART: Well, we'd better take a look around. Get me Air Sea Rescue. "
645,(A Sea King takes off.)
646,
647, [Sea Fort crew room]
648,
649, JO: How's it going? 
650,DOCTOR: Nearly finished. Just about to test it. 
651,(The Doctor has been working on a transistor radio.) 
652,"JO: Hmm, I've seen things like that in a modern art exhibition. You"
653,"don't honestly think you can transmit with it, do you? "
654,"DOCTOR: Certainly I do. I'll prove it to you. Right, here goes. "
655,"D J  : Hey there, early birds, we've got a wonderful batch"
656,"of discs for you this morning! So, don't feel isolated and cut off from"
657,"the world. Whoever you are, wherever you are, we've got something just"
658,for you! 
659,"JO: Hey, that was my favourite DJ. "
660,DOCTOR: I think I must have got me wires crossed somewhere. 
661,JO: Here's your tea. 
662,DOCTOR: Thanks. 
663,JO: Doctor? 
664,DOCTOR: Mmm? 
665,JO: Those things that attacked us. You said you'd seen something like
666,it before. 
667,"DOCTOR: Something very similar, certainly. They emerged from some caves"
668,in Derbyshire. 
669,JO: 
670,"The Silurians, wasn't it? The Brigadier was telling me. "
671,DOCTOR: That's a complete misnomer. The chap who discovered them must
672,"have got the period wrong. No, properly speaking, they should have been"
673,called the Eocenes. 
674,JO: That was that race of super reptiles that had been in hibernation
675,"for billions of years, wasn't it? "
676,"DOCTOR: That's right, and if you want my opinion, there's another of"
677,their colony right here beneath us. 
678,"JO: Well, something seems to have woken them up. "
679,DOCTOR: Probably the rebuilding of this fort. 
680,JO: But I thought you said they lived in caves? 
681,"DOCTOR: Well, this is a different species, completely adapted to life"
682,underwater. 
683,JO: And they've been sinking this ships? 
684,DOCTOR: Very likely. 
685,"JO: Why? I mean, why are they so hostile? What have we done to them? "
686,"DOCTOR: They still think of Earth as their planet, Jo, and they want it"
687,"back. As far as they're concerned, man is just an ape who got above"
688,"himself. Right, I think that should do it. Let's have another go."
689,"Hello, hello. Mayday, Mayday, Mayday! This is, er, this, er, this is."
690,What is this? What's our call sign? 
691,(Jo reads the note on the wall above where the radio used to be.) 
692,JO: Oscar Bravo Tango Seven Four. 
693,"DOCTOR: Hello, Mayday, Mayday, Mayday, this is Oscar Bravo Tango Seven"
694,Four. We are stranded on this fort and have a wounded man here. Can you
695,send immediate assistance? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Over. 
696,"JO: Oh Doctor, you don't think you'll get through to anybody on that"
697,"old lash-up, do you? "
698,"PILOT : Hello, Oscar Bravo Tango, am receiving you loud and clear."
699,Am about to land. Over. 
700,(Helicopter rotors can be heard overhead.) 
701,JO: It works! 
702,"DOCTOR: Hello, Oscar Bravo Tango speaking. Who are you? Who are you?"
703,Over. 
704,(Jo runs outside to look through a window.) 
705,JO: It's a helicopter! 
706,"DOCTOR: Yes. Well, though I say so myself, I think that's a remarkably"
707,efficient piece of work. 
708,(And the set goes Bang!)
709,
710, [The Master's cell]
711,
712, (Trenchard enters with a guard who is carrying a
713,large box.) 
714,"TRENCHARD: Right, put it over there. Here we are then. "
715,MASTER: Splendid! 
716,"TRENCHARD: None too easy, you know, getting hold of something like this"
717,at a moments notice. Had to send one of my chaps to the mainland. Said
718,it was for theatricals. 
719,MASTER: How very ingenious. 
720,"TRENCHARD: Nothing to it. Just have to use the old loaf, you know. When"
721,do we leave? 
722,(The Master is wearing a naval officer's cap.) 
723,MASTER: As soon as possible.
724,
725, [Hart's office]
726,
727,(Hart enters with the Doctor and Jo.) 
728,HART: How can I go to the Admiralty with a story like that? Sea Devils.
729,If only you had some proof. 
730,JO: What about the two men on the fort? One of them was killed but the
731,other one saw the creature. 
732,"HART: Yes. Get on to sickbay, will you? See if he's conscious yet. "
733,"BLYTHE: Sickbay, please. Oh hello, Captain Hart's secretary "
734,DOCTOR: Even you must admit that something happened on that fort! 
735,"HART: Well, perhaps one of them went berserk and attacked the other"
736,one. 
737,"JO: But we saw it too, remember? "
738,"HART: You may. Well, Blythe? "
739,BLYTHE: He's still delirious and he's babbling something about sea
740,devils.
741,
742, [Naval base]
743,
744, (A prison guard drives Trenchard into HMS Seaspite
745,"and parks up. Actually HMS St George, Portsmouth) "
746,TRENCHARD: You can go to the Petty Officer's mess. I'll send for you
747,later. 
748,"GUARD: Very good, sir. "
749,(The guard leaves. Trenchard looks around then knocks on the side of
750,the car and walks away. The Master comes out from underneath a rug in
751,the back dressed in a Lieutenant Commander's uniform. A squad of
752,ratings marches past.) 
753,"CPO: Squad, eyes right! "
754,(The Master salutes.) 
755,"CPO: Eyes front! About turn! Squad, halt! "
756,"(The Master walks off into the base, saluting another group of sailors"
757,on his way.)
758,
759, [Hart's office] 
760," HART: (into phone) Well, did he say why he wanted"
761,"to see me? Oh, all right, you'd better send him up. All right then,"
762,"Doctor, let's assume that I accept the existence of these Sea Devils."
763,What do you want me to do? 
764,"DOCTOR: Well, to begin with, we must make every effort to make contact"
765,with them. 
766,HART: But you claim that they're responsible for sinking the ships. 
767,DOCTOR: It may still be possible to find a peaceful solution. We're not
768,"dealing with animals, Captain Hart, we're dealing with intelligent"
769,beings. 
770,(There is a knock on the door and Trenchard enters.) 
771,"TRENCHARD: Have you got a minute, old chap? Ah, thanks very much. Want"
772,a word with you about the golf tournament. Good heavens! 
773,DOCTOR: Colonel Trenchard. 
774,TRENCHARD: Doctor. Miss Grant. Thought you two'd left the island
775,yesterday. 
776,"JO: Well, we didn't quite manage to get away. "
777,"TRENCHARD: Taking a look round the island? Charming spot, isn't it? "
778,(Hart clears his throat loudly.) 
779,"TRENCHARD: Er, sorry to bother you, John, old man, but it's about the"
780,"weekend. We are rather relying on you, you know. "
781,"HART: Of course I'll do my best, but if we get a bit of a flap on, then"
782,
783,"TRENCHARD: That's just what I was thinking, so perhaps it would be as"
784,well if I arranged to have a reserve standing by. 
785,"DOCTOR: Yes, why don't you do that, Colonel? Captain Hart is likely to"
786,be very busy from now on. 
787,"HART: Yes, life is rather full at the moment, George. "
788,"TRENCHARD: Exactly! So as I was passing, I just thought, old John's"
789,going to pretty tied up with all these ship's sinking. Is it fair to
790,ask him to play golf in the middle of something like this? So I said to
791,"myself, What I'll do is I'll just drop by and sound him out. You see,"
792,time's getting short and I've got to get cracking. 
793, [Naval base stores]
794,
795, (The Master goes behind the counter and starts
796,collecting items from the shelves. He is putting them into a duffel bag
797,when the Chief enters.) 
798,"SMEDLEY: I'm sorry, sir, but should I know you? "
799,"MASTER: You certainly should, Chief. Had you not been warned of my"
800,coming? 
801,"SMEDLEY: No, I'm afraid not, sir. "
802,"MASTER: Special audit, Ministry of Defence. "
803,"SMEDLEY: Special audit, sir? "
804,"MASTER: Yes, the items in this bag here are defective. Did you realise"
805,"that you were carrying defective supplies here, Chief? "
806,"SMEDLEY: Look, I'm sorry, sir, but do you mind if I see your pass,"
807,please? 
808,MASTER: Captain Hart's preparing it right now. He'll be bringing it
809,down right away. 
810,"SMEDLEY: I see, sir. Well then, you won't mind if I just phone and"
811,"double check then, will you. "
812,MASTER: What exactly are you suggesting? 
813,"SMEDLEY: I'm not suggesting anything, sir. I'm just obeying orders. "
814,"MASTER: You will obey my order, Chief Petty Officer! "
815,"SMEDLEY: Your order, sir? "
816,(The Master fixes Smedley with his Look.) 
817,MASTER: You will obey me. You have seen my pass and it is quite
818,correct. 
819,SMEDLEY: Your pass. 
820,MASTER: You have seen my pass. 
821,"SMEDLEY: No, I've got to phone and check. "
822,"(So the Master gives him a chop to the back of the neck, picks up the"
823,bag and leaves.)
824,
825, [Hart's office]
826,
827," HART: Now, don't worry, George. If I can't make"
828,"the tournament, I'll let you know in plenty of time. "
829,"TRENCHARD: Yes, but you do understand I don't want you to feel under"
830,"any pressure about this. If you want to drop out, I suppose I could"
831,rope in old Harry. 
832,"HART: Well, perhaps that's for the best. Now, if you don't mind,"
833,George? 
834,"TRENCHARD: At the same time, I don't want you to miss your game. I mean"
835,",we we'd much rather have you if you can manage it. "
836,"HART: Well, I'll do my best. Now goodbye, George. "
837,"TRENCHARD: Yes, yes, of course. I see how busy you are. "
838,HART: Yes. 
839,"TRENCHARD: Staying down here much longer, Doctor? "
840,DOCTOR: It entirely depends how long it takes me to conclude my
841,"business. Good day, Colonel. "
842,"TRENCHARD: Yes, yes, of course, I mustn't hold you up. Goodbye, Miss"
843,Grant. It's been a great pleasure to see you again. 
844,"JO: Goodbye, Colonel. "
845,"TRENCHARD: Well, I'll, er, I'll be pushing off then. Oh, thanks very"
846,much. 
847,"HART: I'll be in touch, George. "
848,TRENCHARD: Yes. 
849,(Trenchard leaves.) 
850,"HART: Now then, Doctor, where were we? "
851,DOCTOR: Where were we indeed? Ships must be kept away from this area. 
852,"HART: Doctor, those are major shipping lanes. We'd have protests from"
853,all over the world. 
854,DOCTOR: You'll have even bigger protests if ships go on sinking. 
855,"HART: And even if we do declare it a prohibited area, how are we going"
856,to enforce it? 
857,(Jo looks out of the window and sees something that surprises her.) 
858,HART: You know what happens in the English Channel. Trinity House
859,marker buoys are ignored half the time. 
860,"DOCTOR: You'll just have to patrol the area, won't you? "
861,HART: What are we supposed to do? (unintelligible under music) 
862,DOCTOR: You don't seem to realise how dangerous 
863,JO: Doctor! 
864,DOCTOR: What? 
865,"JO: Doctor, come here! "
866,"DOCTOR: Jo, please, not now. "
867,HART: Don't you believe it. 
868,"JO: Doctor, it's the Master! "
869,DOCTOR: What? Where? 
870,JO: Down 
871,(The area is empty.) 
872,"JO: But it was him. Look, I know it was. "
873,"DOCTOR: Captain Hart, I suggest that you order a full security alert"
874,immediately. 
875,HART: Would you mind telling me what this is all about? 
876,DOCTOR: Miss Grant has just seen a very dangerous criminal on your
877,base. 
878,"HART: Doctor, I've been very patient with you, but if I thought "
879,"BLYTHE: Sir, someone's been found unconscious in the sonar stores. "
880,DOCTOR: Come on. 
881,(The guard drives Trenchard and the lumpy car rug out of the gates just
882,before the alarm sounds.)
883,
884, [Naval base stores] 
885," SMEDLEY: I don't know. He was taking equipment,"
886,"sir. Said he was doing some special audit. Well, I went to phone up to"
887,check and that's when he hit me. 
888,DOCTOR: What did this officer look like? 
889,SMEDLEY: About my height. He was dark and he had a short beard. 
890,JO: You see? The Master. 
891,HART: Who is the Master? 
892,JO: How did he get in here? He's supposed to be locked up. 
893,DOCTOR: Trenchard. 
894,JO: What? 
895,"DOCTOR: Well, don't you see? He arrived just before this happened and"
896,he left a few moments ago. 
897,JO: Of course. All that silly talk about a golf tournament. 
898,HART: Are you suggesting that George Trenchard is mixed up in all this?
899,
900,"DOCTOR: Yes, I certainly am. Captain Hart, can you lend me some"
901,transport? 
902,"HART: Well, of course I can, but what's it all about? "
903,"DOCTOR: No time to explain now. Come on, Jo."
904,
905, [Governor's office]
906,
907, (The Doctor and Jo arrive at the castle in a Royal
908,"Navy Land Rover. Trenchard is practising his putting, and boy does he"
909,need the practise. There is a knock at the door.) 
910,TRENCHARD: In conference. 
911,"(The Doctor enters, followed by Jo.) "
912,DOCTOR: Colonel Trenchard. 
913,"TRENCHARD: Hello, old chap. What are you doing here? "
914,DOCTOR: I've reason to believe that your prisoner has escaped. 
915,TRENCHARD: Nonsense! 
916,DOCTOR: It is? 
917,TRENCHARD: See for yourself. 
918,(Trenchard turns on the monitor. The Master is reading a book.) 
919,"TRENCHARD: There you are, you see? Safe and sound. "
920,"JO: Well he may be here now, but half an hour ago he was at the naval"
921,base. 
922,TRENCHARD: Impossible. Must be a case of mistaken identity. 
923,(The Doctor gives him a Look of his own.) 
924,"TRENCHARD: I'll tell you what, though. I'll go and check the guards"
925,myself. 
926,"DOCTOR: Yes, you do that. "
927,TRENCHARD: Yes. 
928,(Trenchard leaves. A moment later Jo checks that the corridor is
929,empty.) 
930,JO: All clear. 
931,"DOCTOR: Try and get an outside line. No, they're both completely dead."
932,"Now listen, Jo. I want you to take the jeep, go down to the naval base"
933,and call UNIT. Tell them that Colonel Trenchard and his entire staff
934,are to replaced immediately. 
935,"JO: But, Doctor "
936,"DOCTOR: No buts, Jo. Just do as I ask. "
937,JO: What about you? 
938,"DOCTOR: Now, don't worry about me. I'll stay here and keep an eye on"
939,"him. Now, you hurry."

941, [The Master's cell]
942,
943, TRENCHARD: But the girl saw you! 
944,"MASTER: Oh, it could only have been a fleeting glimpse. Convince her"
945,that she was mistaken. 
946,"TRENCHARD: I tell you, they don't believe me. The Doctor knows. "
947,"MASTER: Very well. In that case, suggest to the Doctor that he come"
948,down here and see me for himself. 
949,TRENCHARD: What's the good of that? 
950,MASTER: I'll tell him exactly what we're doing. I'll convince him to
951,keep quiet. 
952,TRENCHARD: Could you? 
953,"MASTER: Yes, yes. But I must see him alone. I don't want any guards."
954,You leave everything to me. I'll put the Doctor's mind at rest. 
955,TRENCHARD: All right. I suppose it's worth a try. 
956,(Trenchard leaves. The Master climbs on a chair and removes a grille
957,from in front of a security camera. He puts a cloth over the lens and
958,replaces the grille. Then he presses a button by the inner door and
959,sits down. A guard enters.) 
960,"MASTER: Ah, I think there's something wrong with the air conditioning"
961,"in here. Now, that grille seems to be blocked. "
962,"(The guard turns and looks up, and the Master hits him on the back of"
963,"the head, double fisted, and takes his knife.)"

968,golf ball. Trenchard enters.)

970,DOCTOR: Fore! 
971,(The golf ball shoots along the carpet and into the glass.) 
972,TRENCHARD: Bless my soul! 
973,"DOCTOR: You were saying, Colonel? "
974,"TRENCHARD: Er, where's Miss Grant? "
975,"DOCTOR: Oh, she's gone back to the naval base. "
976,"TRENCHARD: Oh, I see. Look here, old chap, if you're worried, I suggest"
977,you go and see the prisoner yourself. 
978,"DOCTOR: Oh, I've just seen him. "
979,TRENCHARD: What? 
980,"DOCTOR: Yes, on there. "
981,"TRENCHARD: Oh! Yes, quite, but if you're in any doubt, I'd sooner you"
982,"interrogated the man yourself. You know the way, don't you? "
983,DOCTOR: If you insist. 
984,(The Doctor leaves. Trenchard picks up the internal phone.) 
985,TRENCHARD: Trenchard here. There is a Miss Grant on her way down to
986,you. She is not to leave.

990, (The door is wide open and there are no guards.
991,The Doctor stands in the doorway.) 
992,"MASTER: Why, Doctor, so you came for a chat. "
993,"DOCTOR: Been out for a little jaunt, have you? "
994,MASTER: I beg your pardon? 
995,DOCTOR: Why did you go to the naval stores and steal those electronic
996,spares? 
997,MASTER: How could I possibly go anywhere? You know very well that I'm a
998,prisoner. 
999,DOCTOR: You've got some sort of hold over Colonel Trenchard. What's
1000,going on? 
1001,MASTER: I can see that I shall have to tell you everything. 
1002,(The Master produces the guard's gun from under his newspaper.) 
1003,DOCTOR: Good afternoon!

1008, (The Master opens the door and steps out.) 
1009,DOCTOR: Akidai! 
1010,(And kicks the gun out of the Master's hand. The Master grabs a foil
1011,from a rack on the wall.) 
1012,DOCTOR: Like that is it? 
1013,(And takes a foil from another rack. The two foes fence. The Doctor
1014,"pushes the Master back, and he stumbles, so the Doctor disappears"
1015,behind a curtained doorway. The Master starts slashing at the fabric.) 
1016,DOCTOR: I wouldn't do that if I were you. That's government property. 
1017,(The Doctor has come round behind him. They cross swords again and the
1018,Master pushes the Doctor into the cell.)

1023,"dodges the Master's attacks then disarms him, holding him pinned by the"
1024,tip of his foil.) 
1025,DOCTOR: I always find that violent exercise makes me hungry. Don't you
1026,agree? 
1027,(The Doctor takes a bite from one of the Master's sandwiches.) 
1028,"MASTER: Then you'd better enjoy your meal, Doctor, because it might be"
1029,your last. 
1030,"DOCTOR: Oh, you think so? "
1031,(The Doctor returns the Master's foil. The Master drives him back into
1032,the chair.) 
1033,"MASTER: You're good, Doctor, but you're not good enough. "
1034,"DOCTOR: Ah, but you haven't seen the quality of my footwork yet! "
1035,"(The Doctor kicks the Master back over the table. Disarmed again, the"
1036,Master stays on the floor.) 
1037,"DOCTOR: Tut, tut, tut. How many times have I told you? Violence will"

1044, TRENCHARD: What's going on here? 
1045,(The Doctor looks round as the knife thuds into the bathroom door
1046,frame.) 
1047,MASTER: I was defending myself. This man came here to kill me. 
1048,"TRENCHARD: Be so good as to explain yourself, Doctor. "
1049,DOCTOR: Only a complete fool would listen to such an accusation. Though
1050,I suppose in your case. 
1051,TRENCHARD: Don't speak to me like that. I shall have a full enquiry
1052,"into the whole thing. Meanwhile, consider yourself under arrest. Take"
1053,him to my office immediately. 
1054,"DOCTOR: Oh, don't be absurd, man. "
1055,TRENCHARD: You heard me. Take him away. (A guard keeps the Doctor
1056,covered with his pistol as he throws down the foils and walks across
1057,the cell.) 
1058,DOCTOR: If you must continue with this ridiculous charade. Only take
1059,"care not to lose him this time, won't you? "
1060,(The Doctor and the guard leave.) 
1061,"TRENCHARD: What are you going to do, kill him? I warn you "
1062,"MASTER: I told you. I was defending myself. The point is, what are you"
1063,going to do about it? 
1064,TRENCHARD: This whole thing's getting out of hand. I just don't know. 
1065,"MASTER: Well then, I'll tell you. Keep the Doctor here a prisoner. You"
1066,"have no alternative. By the way, is the girl with him? "
1067,"TRENCHARD: Yes. She was going to leave, but I had her stopped at the"
1068,main entrance. 
1069,MASTER: Good. Then there's nothing to worry about.

1073, (Jo goes up to the guard who is holding the car
1074,keys. He puts them in his pocket.) 
1075,JO: The keys! I've got to get back to the naval base. It's urgent! 
1076,"BARCLAY: Sorry, Miss. Orders. Take her back inside. "
1077,(Barclay turns Jo around so she elbows him in the stomach and pushes
1078,"him into his colleague, then runs.) "
1079,"BARCLAY: Well, don't just sit there. Get after her!"

1081, [Governor's office]
1082,
1083,"(The guard is standing in front of the monitor,"
1084,staring directly ahead.) 
1085,DOCTOR: Have you any idea why Colonel Trenchard is taking orders from
1086,"the Master? Look, man, I'm talking to you. "
1087,(The Doctor snaps his fingers in front of the guard's face and gets him
1088,to turn his head slightly.) 
1089,DOCTOR: Very well. 
1090,(Trenchard enters.) 
1091,"TRENCHARD: Now then, Doctor, I'm afraid you're in very serious trouble."
1092,I've been giving this matter some thought. I'm going to hold you here
1093,until the whole thing's cleared up. 
1094,DOCTOR: Is that what the Master told you to say? 
1095,"TRENCHARD: You've attacked a government employee, and tried to harm a"
1096,prisoner under my care and protection. 
1097,DOCTOR: I've done no such thing. The Master knocked that guard out
1098,"himself, as you very well know. "
1099,"TRENCHARD: And as for this UNIT pass of yours, I believe it's a"
1100,forgery. 
1101,(Trenchard rips up the UNIT 10 pass.) 
1102,DOCTOR: That's absolute rubbish. Anybody at UNIT headquarters will
1103,"vouch for me, if you'll permit me to use the telephone. "
1104,TRENCHARD: Prisoners are not allowed to make telephone calls. 
1105,"DOCTOR: Colonel Trenchard, why are you allowing the Master to use you"
1106,like this? 
1107,"TRENCHARD: All right, take him away. "
1108,"DOCTOR: Look, you're jeopardising your entire career. "
1109,TRENCHARD: I have nothing further to say to you. The interview is over.
1110,
1111,DOCTOR: Didn't anybody else warn you about the Master? Whatever he's
1112,"told you, it's all lies. "
1113,TRENCHARD: You'll be well treated as long as you behave yourself. 
1114,DOCTOR: You really think you can keep me here? 
1115,"TRENCHARD: This is no ordinary prison. If you attempt to escape, the"
1116,guards will shoot to kill. 
1117,DOCTOR: I see. Thank you. Thank you very much. 
1118,(The Doctor and the guard leave. The telephone rings.) 
1119,TRENCHARD: Trenchard. What? Then find her. Now! 
1120,"(Jo hides behind some brambles as a bunch of guards run past, then sets"
1121,off again.)

1125," (The Master is doing some delicate soldering,"
1126,looking through a magnifying glass on a stand.) 
1127,TRENCHARD: I've got him under lock and key. 
1128,"MASTER: Just a minute. Under lock and key, eh? "
1129,TRENCHARD: Yes. 
1130,"MASTER: The girl, too? "
1131,TRENCHARD: What a fascinating contraption. 
1132,MASTER: I asked about the girl. 
1133,"TRENCHARD: Oh, little mishap on the way back here. She got away. "
1134,"MASTER: And by now is, no doubt, running straight back to the naval"
1135,base. 
1136,"TRENCHARD: Oh, no fear of that. She'll never get out of the grounds."
1137,Guards'll pick her up at any moment. 
1138,MASTER: I hope that you're right. 
1139,"TRENCHARD: Oh, no doubt about it. "
1140,"MASTER: Nevertheless, we need to work very fast from now on. Trenchard,"
1141,"I need your fullest cooperation. Tell me, where is the Doctor? "
1142,TRENCHARD: In a security cell. 
1143,"MASTER: Send him to me, will you? I want a word with him."

1145, [Hart's office]
1146,
1147," HART: I can't give you much to go on, I'm afraid,"
1148,but I believe there's something down there. Your submarine's fitted
1149,with the new experimental sonar. It'll give you a chance to try it out.
1150,
1151,(The submarine Commander sports a 'full set' of whiskers.) 
1152,"RIDGEWAY: What are we looking for, sir? "
1153,HART: I wish I knew. The man we took off the fort was babbling
1154,something about sea devils. 
1155,"RIDGEWAY: Oh, don't you think this is getting a bit out of hand, sir?"
1156,Ships have vanished at sea before. 
1157,"HART: I'm well aware of that. To be exact, seventy in the last ten"
1158,years. But we've lost three all in the same area in the last few weeks.
1159,
1160,"RIDGEWAY: We'll do what we can to find your sea devils, sir. "
1161,HART: I want you to signal me a full report the moment you resurface. 
1162,"RIDGEWAY: Yes, sir. "
1163,"HART: All right, carry on. "
1164,"RIDGEWAY: Thank you, sir. "
1165,HART: And good luck. 
1166,"RIDGEWAY: Thank you, sir. "
1167,(Ridgeway leaves.) 
1168,"BLYTHE: Excuse me, sir? "
1169,HART: Yes? 
1170,BLYTHE: I was just wondering about Miss Grant and the Doctor. Shouldn't
1171,they be back by now?
1172,
1173, [The Master's cell]
1174,
1175," TRENCHARD: All right, Doctor. Come along in. "
1176,(The Doctor has his wrists loosely manacled. A guard stands in the
1177,doorway. The Master is back in his usual suit.) 
1178,"MASTER: Ah, Doctor. Good of you to spare me a few moments. "
1179,DOCTOR: I hadn't really anything better to do. 
1180,"MASTER: Yes, time does hang heavy when one is a prisoner. Would you"
1181,care to sit down? 
1182,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
1183,(The Master silently indicates the manacles.) 
1184,TRENCHARD: Right. 
1185,(The guard unfastens one cuff.) 
1186,DOCTOR: How very kind of you. 
1187,(Then pulls the Doctor's arms behind the chair and fastens it again.) 
1188,DOCTOR: How very unkind of you. 
1189,"TRENCHARD: Right, I'll leave you to have your little chat. There will"
1190,be a guard outside at all times. 
1191,DOCTOR: I'm very relieved to hear it. 
1192,(Trenchard and the guard leave. The Master shuts the door.) 
1193,"MASTER: No doubt, Doctor, you're wondering why I sent for you? "
1194,"DOCTOR: Your usual childish desire to gloat, perhaps? "
1195,MASTER: How much have you told UNIT? 
1196,DOCTOR: Everything. I sent them a full report as soon as Miss Grant
1197,spotted you at the naval base. 
1198,MASTER: And yet you came back here to investigate in person.
1199,"Interesting. You know, I wonder whether you're telling me the truth. "
1200,"DOCTOR: Well, you'll find out soon enough. "
1201,"MASTER: You realise, of course, that I could kill you here and now? "
1202,DOCTOR: And how would you explain that away to Colonel Trenchard? I'm
1203,"hardly in a position to attack you, now am I? "
1204,MASTER: Do you really think I care what Trenchard thinks? 
1205,"DOCTOR: Whatever you're up to, you still need Trenchard's cooperation."
1206,"You're still a prisoner here, you know. "
1207,"MASTER: My dear Doctor, I can walk out of here any time I choose. "
1208,DOCTOR: Then why don't you? 
1209,MASTER: Because this place makes a good base for my operations. You
1210,"see, I'm planning to contact our reptilian friends. "
1211,DOCTOR: How do you know about them? 
1212,"MASTER: Oh, from the Time Lord's files. "
1213,DOCTOR: More stolen information? 
1214,MASTER: Naturally. 
1215,"DOCTOR: Well, why do you want to contact them? "
1216,"MASTER: Those reptiles, Doctor, were once the rulers of this Earth. And"

1232,"HART: Oh, I see. "
1233,"BLYTHE: But they didn't bring the Land Rover back, sir. Colonel"
1234,Trenchard said they took a taxi to the quay. 
1235,"HART: Well, you'd better send someone to collect it. "
1236,"BLYTHE: Yes, sir, but why take a taxi when they could have used the"
1237,"Land Rover, and, well "

1261,"human race of which you are so fond. Believe me, that'll be a reward in"

1288,"in, and he is to wait five minutes then start making a lot of noise."
1289,The Doctor mouths 'okay' and looks at the clock. 2:07. Jo carries on
1290,round the building until she finds a sash window which has been left
1291,slightly open. It is just big enough for her to crawl through into a
1292,"small room then out across a small, cluttered courtyard and through a"
1293,doorway under an external stone staircase that a guard comes down. From
1294,there she makes her way through small corridors. It is now 2:13.)

1336,they went. 
1337,HART: I see. But Miss Grant was sure she'd caught sight of your
1338,prisoner at the base. 
1339,"TRENCHARD: Absolutely ridiculous! This place is totally secure. Oh,"
1340,just take a look at the alarm system. There. 
1341,(Trenchard calls up a diagram on the monitor.) 
1342,"HART: And you see, George, you did drop in on me at exactly the time of"
1343,the robbery. 
1344,"TRENCHARD: My dear chap, you're scarcely suggesting that I pinched your"
1345,wretched material? Don't understand the stuff. Tried to make myself a
1346,crystal set once when I was a lad. Never got it to work. 
1347,"HART: Well then, would it be possible to see your prisoner? "
1348,"TRENCHARD: Oh, strictly against the rules. No one can see him without a"
1349,special pass. Completely incommunicado. 
1350,"HART: Oh, surely we can stretch the rules, George? This is important. "
1351,"TRENCHARD: Well, all right, old chap, seeing it's you. Take a look at"

1353,HART: Thank you.

1355,TRENCHARD: There you are. 
1356,"HART: Well, I suppose the Doctor must have been wrong. "
1357,TRENCHARD: Of course he was. Seemed a pretty cranky sort of fellow to

1373,"MITCHELL: Er, no, sir. Nothing. Nothing at all. "
1374,"RIDGEWAY: Well, keep trying, old chap. "
1375,MITCHELL: Sir. 
1376,(There is a return ping.) 
1377,"MITCHELL: Er, we have a contact, sir. "
1378,"(The sonar goes to simultaneous pings and the operator, Lovell, rips"
1379,off his headphones.) 
1380,RIDGEWAY: What the blazes is that? 
1381,"LOVELL: It's gone crazy, sir. "
1382,RIDGEWAY: Get on to the sonar maintenance. 
1383,"MITCHELL: Aye, aye, sir. "
1384,"LOVELL: It's packed up, sir. "
1385,"MITCHELL: It's gone dead, sir! "
1386,(Then the lights go out.) 
1387,RIDGEWAY: What the devil's going on? 
1388,"ENGINEER : Manoeuvring room here, sir. Loss of essential power"
1389,supplies.

1397,(The Master comes down a small staircase in the
1398,office.) 
1399,"MASTER: Well, Trenchard. I think that you handled Captain Hart"
1400,exceedingly well. 
1401,"TRENCHARD: I can't keep it up, you know. The lies I've told. How long"
1402,before that device of yours is ready? 
1403,"MASTER: Oh, just a few hours now. "
1404,TRENCHARD: What is exactly is it? 
1405,MASTER: It's a perfect replica of the communications device used by the
1406,enemy agents. We are going to use it to lure them into a trap. 
1407,"TRENCHARD: I only hope it works. If it doesn't, I'm for it, you know? "
1408,"MASTER: Oh, it'll work. Don't you worry about that. Just think of it,"
1409,Trenchard. You will be responsible for exposing some of the most
1410,dangerous saboteurs this country has ever known. I think you'll find
1411,that a grateful government will give you anything that you ask for. 
1412,"TRENCHARD: Oh, don't want any reward, of course. Just doing my duty. "
1413,"MASTER: Yes, of course. I'd better get back to my quarters. "
1414,"TRENCHARD: This Doctor fellow, have you finished with him? "
1415,"MASTER: For the time being, yes. Oh, by the way, what about the girl?"
1416,Have they caught her yet? 
1417,"TRENCHARD: Oh, grounds are very large, you know. Only a matter of time,"
1418,though. She can't get away. 
1419,"MASTER: I hope you're right. Er, it might be better if one of the"
1420,guards were to take me back. 
1421,"TRENCHARD: Huh? Oh, yes, of course! Er, must keep up appearances, what?"

1427,is 2:20.) 
1428,DOCTOR: (sotto) Behind the door. 
1429,(Jo hides again.) 
1430,DOCTOR: Guard! Guard. Guard! I want to talk to you! 
1431,(Drew enters.) 
1432,"DREW: What's wrong now, sir? "
1433,DOCTOR: These handcuffs. They're far too tight. They're killing me. 
1434,(Jo kneels down directly behind Drew.) 
1435,"DREW: I'm under strict instructions, sir, that they're to be kept on "
1436,"(The Doctor butts Drew, sending him tumbling over Jo, who then chops"
1437,him across the throat. The Doctor unwinds the chains from the chair.)

1453,manacles and cradling Drew's head in his lap.) 
1454,TRENCHARD: What's happened? 
1455,MASTER: It would appear that Miss Grant has succeeded in releasing the
1456,Doctor. 
1457,TRENCHARD: This is appalling! It'll ruin everything! 
1458,MASTER: Exactly. That's why you've got to find them!

1461,
1462,(The boat is sinking.) 
1463,"MITCHELL: It's no good, sir. There's absolutely nothing wrong with the"
1464,engines. We've run a complete check on them. 
1465,RIDGEWAY: And we're still going down. 
1466,(She hits bottom.) 
1467,"MITCHELL: What do we do now, sir? "
1468,RIDGEWAY: Keep working on the engines. 
1469,"MITCHELL: There's nothing wrong with them, sir. There's nothing wrong"
1470,with any part of this boat. We've checked everything. 
1471,RIDGEWAY: Then check again. 
1472,(Something starts banging on the hull.) 
1473,MITCHELL: Divers? 
1474,RIDGEWAY: That's impossible. 
1475,"MITCHELL: There's something out there, sir. "
1476,"RATING : Forward section here, sir. We're being attacked. "
1477,(Men shouting in the background.) 
1478,RIDGEWAY: This is the captain. what's happening? 
1479,"RATING : Someone's coming in, sir, through the escape compartment. "
1480,RIDGEWAY: Shut off forward and aft escape compartments. 
1481,"MITCHELL: Aye, aye, sir. "
1482,"RIDGEWAY: What's happening, man? "
1483,"RATING : They're coming in, sir! They're Aargh!"

1485, [Governor's office]

1487, TRENCHARD: (into phone) Understand this. They've
1488,got to be found. They're two dangerous enemy agents. Use every
1489,available man.

1500,(Trenchard puts the phone down.) 
1501,"TRENCHARD: They're making for the beach, towards the minefield. "
1502,MASTER: No doubt they're trying to rejoin their associates at sea. 
1503,TRENCHARD: Right. We must head them off. 
1504,MASTER: No. Let them get to the beach. 
1505,TRENCHARD: But we've got to catch them. 
1506,MASTER: We shall. This device is now ready for testing. We shall use it
1507,trap them all together. 
1508,"(The Master switches on his device. A small dish starts spinning,"
1509,broadcasting its signal.)

1512,
1513, (The Doctor uses the rope from a life-belt at the
1514,top of the sandy cliff to rappel down to the beach.) 
1515,"DOCTOR: Come on, Jo! Come on! "
1516,"(The Master, Trenchard and guards are running towards them so she goes"
1517,down the rope too. The Master kneels on the cliff edge with his
1518,transmitter. The Doctor and Jo run across the beach but are cut off by
1519,guards in a 2CV. To their right is a cordoned off area labelled Danger
1520,Minefield. The Master switches on his transmitter and points it at the
1521,waves. A reptile like the one on the old Fort emerges from the surf.
1522,The guards turn.)

1524, Episode Four
1525,
1526, [Cliff and Beach]
1527,
1528, TRENCHARD: What is it? 
1529,MASTER: One of the creatures that have been destroying the ships. 
1530,TRENCHARD: You told me it was enemy agents. Why didn't you tell me the
1531,truth? 
1532,"MASTER: If I had, would you have believed me? "
1533,"(On the beach, the guards are staring at the reptile.) "
1534,DOCTOR: There's only one thing for it. We'll have to go through the
1535,minefield. 
1536,"(The reptile uses its weapon and kills one guard, then another. A"
1537,gunfight starts. The Doctor throws himself across the first roll of
1538,"barbed wire to flatten it and let Jo across, then the second and into"
1539,the minefield proper.) 
1540,JO: We'll get blown up. 
1541,"DOCTOR: No, don't worry. "
1542,JO: What are you doing? 
1543,DOCTOR: My sonic screwdriver. It converts into rather a good mine
1544,detector. 
1545,(The screwdriver pings like sonar. This attracts the reptile who has
1546,now killed all the guards.) 
1547,"DOCTOR: Look out. Look, there's one over there. Now, you'll have to"
1548,move round to the right. Now follow me. 
1549,MASTER: Stupid beast. Why doesn't it attack them? 
1550,(The Master alters the amplitude of the transmission and the reptile
1551,heads for the minefield. The Doctor and Jo reach an area where an
1552,unwary seagull has previously set a mine off.) 
1553,"JO: Doctor, it's following us! "
1554,(The reptile comes through the gaps made by the Doctor.) 
1555,JO: Doctor! 
1556,"DOCTOR: Relax, Jo, relax. "
1557,(The Doctor adjustments the screwdriver and aims it back towards the
1558,reptile. A nearby mine goes Bang! then another and another. It takes a
1559,fourth and fifth to sent it screaming back to the waves. The Doctor
1560,retunes again.) 
1561,"DOCTOR: Right, follow me."

1565, HART: Anything from the sub yet? 
1566,"BOWMAN: It's no good, sir, there's nothing. "
1567,HART: They had instructions to surface over an hour ago. 
1568,"BLYTHE: Maybe they've found something, sir. Perhaps they're still"
1569,investigating. 
1570,"HART: If they haven't surfaced by now, then something must be stopping"
1571,"them. All right, submiss procedure. Alert submarine command. We'll set"
1572,up a full scale search right away.

1581,force and intruders have broken through the hull. 
1582,"SUMMERS: Aye, aye, sir. "

1589,"MITCHELL: Aye, aye, sir. "
1590,(Mitchell unbars and unlocks a cupboard.) 
1591,"SUMMERS: Forward hatch is jammed, sir. "

1603,
1604, TRENCHARD: I just can't take it in. It's all too
1605,much for me. 
1606,"MASTER: Trenchard, you really must be more calm. Believe me, it's very"
1607,simple. 
1608,"TRENCHARD: Simple? You've misled me all along. You said it was spies,"
1609,saboteurs. You said we'd catch them. 
1610,"MASTER: Look, if I had talked to you about sea monsters, would you have"
1611,believed me? 
1612,TRENCHARD: I've risked everything to help you and you've lied to me. 
1613,"MASTER: I had to lie. Now sit down, Trenchard. Sit down and listen to"
1614,me. 
1615,TRENCHARD: I don't know how you can be so calm. 
1616,"MASTER: Now listen, that creature that you saw is one of a race of"
1617,"intelligent reptiles that has a deadly hatred of mankind. Now somehow,"
1618,"they've established themselves in the sea, but now they intend to"
1619,emerge and conquer the Earth. 
1620,TRENCHARD: What? We must warn the authorities at once! 
1621,"MASTER: No, no. Premature action would ruin everything. "
1622,TRENCHARD: What else can we do? 
1623,"MASTER: Wait until this device of mine is perfected, and then tell the"
1624,authorities.

1631,"(One guard on horseback, and two vehicles, come careering down the"
1632,slope and past them.)

1634,
1635, [The Master's cell]
1636,
1637, TRENCHARD: They're not in the beach sector. We've
1638,completely lost track of them. 
1639,"MASTER: Trenchard, if they reach the naval base "
1640,TRENCHARD: Exactly. They'll tell Hart everything. 
1641,"MASTER: Mind you, there's a good chance that he won't believe them, of"
1642,course. 
1643,TRENCHARD: But suppose he does? Suppose he turns up here again? 
1644,MASTER: Refuse to admit him. 
1645,TRENCHARD: Don't be ridiculous! 
1646,"MASTER: Trenchard, you are running a top security establishment here."
1647,Your only responsibility is to the government. 
1648,TRENCHARD: What about the Doctor? He'll report to UNIT. They can go to
1649,the government.

1661,RIDGEWAY: Ask Green Gilbert. 
1662,"MITCHELL: All right, old man. Get you there in no time! Er, sir, shall"
1663,"we take a look at the pressure gauge, sir? "
1664,RIDGEWAY: If you'll excuse me one moment? 
1665,(Ridgeway and Mitchell go over to the periscope area.) 
1666,"MITCHELL: Sir, shouldn't we try and jump them? "
1667,RIDGEWAY: No. 
1668,MITCHELL: You mean we're going to do nothing at all?

1676,countryside just to tell you fairy stories. 
1677,HART: Monsters coming out of the sea. 
1678,JO: But it's different this time. Everybody saw it. Even Trenchard and
1679,the guards. 
1680,HART: And you think Trenchard will confirm your story? 
1681,DOCTOR: I doubt it. The Master's got some sort of hold over him. 
1682,JO: The Doctor's seen these creatures before. 
1683,"HART: Oh, I'm quite sure he has, Miss Grant. "
1684,"JO: In some caves in Derbyshire. You see, they want to take over the"
1685,Earth 
1686,"HART: Oh, really, Miss Grant, if you think for one moment I'm going to"
1687,believe 
1688,"JO: Well, re-take if you like, and what they're going to do is "
1689,"DOCTOR: All right, Jo, all right, all right. Let me deal with the"
1690,"explanations. Look, it's like this "
1691,(Blythe enters with a plate of sandwiches for Jo.) 
1692,"BLYTHE: Only cheese, I'm afraid. The best the steward could do. "
1693,"JO: Oh, that's super. Thanks very much. "
1694,"DOCTOR: For heaven's sakes, Jo. What do you think this is, a picnic? "
1695,"DOCTOR: All right, well let's forget about the Sea Devils. What about"
1696,Trenchard trying to take us prisoners then? 
1697,(The Doctor eats Jo's sandwiches.) 
1698,"HART: Well, I only have your word for that, haven't I? "
1699,"DOCTOR: All right, what about the theft of your electronic spares?"
1700,Surely you'll agree that happened? 
1701,"HART: Since I was here at the time, yes. "
1702,"JO: The Master stole those parts to make his calling device, and "
1703,HART: His what? 
1704,"DOCTOR: Well, he's developed some way of communicating with them."
1705,Probably a ultra-high frequency sonic beam. These are rather good. Want
1706,one? 
1707,"HART: No, thank you. "
1708,DOCTOR: Sandwich? 
1709,BLYTHE: Thank you. 
1710,JO: Doctor! 
1711,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm so sorry. "
1712,(Jo is left with the lettuce garnish. The telephone rings.) 
1713,"BLYTHE: Captain Hart's office? Oh, I see. Yes, yes, I'll tell him."
1714,"They've had to abandon the search, sir. They'll start again at first"

1719,(Blythe leaves.) 
1720,DOCTOR: How overdue is the submarine? 
1721,HART: Four hours. 
1722,"DOCTOR: It should never have been sent, you know. They were bound to"
1723,presume it was hostile. 
1724,"HART: Kindly leave the naval side of the operation to me, Doctor. "
1725,"DOCTOR: Captain Hart, you are dealing with a situation completely"
1726,outside of your own experience. And if you won't let me help you 
1727,"HART: All right then, Doctor. What do you want me to do? "
1728,"DOCTOR: Well, the key to this whole situation is at the castle. "
1729,(Bowman puts his head round the door to the radio room.) 
1730,"BOWMAN: Sir, I think we've got something."

1734, HART: Where? 
1735,"BOWMAN: There, sir. Contact bearing two seven zero. Range, twenty"
1736,thousand yards. Heading zero four seven. 
1737,JO: The submarine? 
1738,HART: Could be. 
1739,"BOWMAN: I think it must be, sir. "
1740,DOCTOR: You see where the thing's heading? That beach by castle!
1741,Perhaps you'll believe me now. 
1742, [The Master's cell] 
1743, (The Master has his device running on yet another
1744,"frequency, that sounds like very speeded up speech. Then he switches"
1745,"off, taps at a bank of eight keys and switches on again. Off, more"
1746,"keying, and Trenchard enters.) "
1747,TRENCHARD: That thing working all right? 
1748,"MASTER: It still needs a few minor adjustments, that's all. "
1749,"TRENCHARD: Look, I've been giving some thought to all this. It's going"
1750,to be an enormous job coping with these creatures. We must give the
1751,authorities all the notice we can. 
1752,(The device emits more speeded up speech and the Master unplugs it.) 
1753,TRENCHARD: What was that? 
1754,MASTER: Just random feedback. It's nothing important. 
1755,TRENCHARD: Sounded like some sort of message. 
1756,"MASTER: Look, Trenchard, I am trying to carry out a very difficult and"
1757,"complex task here, and I can't work if I'm being continually"
1758,interrupted. 
1759,"TRENCHARD: I'm terribly sorry, old chap. I'll leave you to it. "
1760,MASTER: Thank you. 
1761,TRENCHARD: Yes. (Trenchard leaves. The Master plugs the machine back in
1762,"and the message comes tumbling out. He smiles. Under cover of darkness,"
1763,"six reptiles are walking through the surf to the shore. Further out,"
1764,six more are emerging from the depths.)
1765,
1766, [Governor's office] 
1767, TRENCHARD: (into phone) I tell you I must speak to
1768,"the Minister. It's most important. Well, when do you expect him back?"
1769,"No, I can't tell you what's wrong. The security of the nation is at"
1770,"risk. Oh, very well, I'll hold on, but please hurry! "
1771,"(In a corridor, a guard spots a melted lock and looks at it. A reptile"
1772,grabs him from behind and breaks his neck.) 
1773,"TRENCHARD: (into phone) No, it can't wait till the morning. Oh, you'll"
1774,have to interrupt his meeting. This is a matter of national urgency.
1775,"Oh, very well, as soon as he's free then. But if there's any"
1776,"unnecessary delay, believe me, you'll answer for it. "
1777,(Trenchard turns on the monitor and watches the Master tapping the keys
1778,on his device. He turns it off and picks up an internal telephone.) 
1779,TRENCHARD: Guard? 
1780,"(Elsewhere, a telephone smashes on the floor and a guard falls next to"
1781,it. Trenchard unlocks a drawer in his desk and takes out his service

1788,Trenchard comes across Drew firing at something.) 
1789,"TRENCHARD: What's happening, man? "
1790,"DREW: They're all over the place, sir! They killed most of the lads! "
1791,TRENCHARD: Who? Who's attacking us?

1834,HART: I don't understand why. 
1835,"DOCTOR: The Master had no further use for him, that's why. "
1836,HART: But why did he help the Master in the first place? 
1837,DOCTOR: What would you say was Trenchard's strongest characteristic? 
1838,"HART: Oh, I don't know. Patriotism, I suppose. "
1839,DOCTOR: Exactly. And the Master used that patriotism as a weapon.

1851,BLYTHE: I see.

2001,Earth when man was only an ape. 
2002,(The Doctor is out of the bell.) 
2003,DOCTOR: Your people went into hibernation and abandoned Earth to its
2004,fate. 
2005,SEA DEVIL: Our astronomers predicted that a great catastrophe would end
2006,all life on the face of the Earth. 
2007,"DOCTOR: Yes, but the catastrophe that you predicted never happened. And"
2008,the apes that you left behind on the surface to die became man. 
2009,SEA DEVIL: You know our history? 
2010,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I've encountered your people before. That is why I"
2011,want to prevent a conflict that can only end in your destruction. 
2012,SEA DEVIL: We shall destroy man and reclaim the planet. Already we have
2013,begun to sink his ships. 
2014,"DOCTOR: Yes, and already more ships are being sent to hunt you down. "
2015,SEA DEVIL: The submarine? We have captured it. 
2016,DOCTOR: You may win a few victories to begin with but eventually you're
2017,bound to lose. 
2018,SEA DEVIL: There are many thousands of our people in hibernation in
2019,this base. We have other colonies hidden all round the world. We shall
2020,be the victors in the war against mankind. 
2021,DOCTOR: But there's no need for a war. Why can't you share the planet? 
2022,SEA DEVIL: That would be impossible. 
2023,DOCTOR: The depths of the sea and those areas on Earth where man cannot
2024,live can be yours. 
2025,SEA DEVIL: And man would agree to that? 
2026,"DOCTOR: There's a chance. Wouldn't it be better to try for a peace,"
2027,than to launch yourself into a war that you cannot possibly win? 
2028,SEA DEVIL: I will consider what you have said. 
2029,"DOCTOR: Let me return to the humans, and I will endeavour to make a"
2030,peace for you.

2039,HART: My submarine is missing in that area. There's a chance that some
2040,of the crew may still be alive. 
2041,JO: And what about the Doctor? He may still be alive down there too! 
2042,HART: Yes.

2045,"BLYTHE: Yes, sir. "
2046,(Blythe takes the toast rack and leaves.) 
2047,"WALKER: Now, I've had a look at that UNIT file about the creatures that"
2048,your friend the Doctor encountered in those caves. And do you know what
2049,happened? Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart blew the whole lot up. 
2050,"JO: Maybe, but I bet he didn't do it by risking the lives of his own"
2051,men. 
2052,"WALKER: Well, that's as maybe, but our line is quite clear. Immediate"
2053,retaliation with everything that we've got.

2055,"WALKER: Your opinion is quite immaterial, Captain Hart. The order's"
2056,already been given. Ships are converging on this area from ports all
2057,over England.

2076,SEA DEVIL: The Master is our friend. 
2077,DOCTOR: He wants only to provoke a war. 
2078,MASTER: I do not! I came here to help you revive your people. 
2079,DOCTOR: Why should you need his help? 
2080,SEA DEVIL: Our hibernation unit is faulty. 
2081,MASTER: And I can now repair it for you. 
2082,DOCTOR: But why revive your people only to have them killed? Let me try
2083,and negotiate that peace for you. 
2084,"MASTER: As you did before, Doctor? The last time this man encountered"
2085,"your race, he tricked them. The humans destroyed them all. "
2086,SEA DEVIL: Is that true?

2088,MASTER: You see? He admits it. Man is weak. Your conquest will be easy.
2089,
2090,"DOCTOR: Believe me, man is not weak. He's only too proficient at"
2091,devising weapons of annihilation and using them. 
2092,SEA DEVIL: He says man is weak. He says man is strong. 
2093,MASTER: He's lying! He's trying to frighten you! 
2094,SEA DEVIL: No. I do not think he lies. Perhaps it would be better to
2095,make peace. I shall have consider what you have said.

2254,"(Summers writes on a pad until the banging stops, then hands the paper"
2255,to Girton.) 
2256,"SUMMERS: Right, it's your turn. Er, you've got to do what it says"
2257,there. 
2258,LOVELL: That's not how you play consequences. 
2259,SUMMERS: It's the way we play. 
2260,LOVELL: Oh. 
2261,(Girton clutches his stomach and groans. Summers gestures him to get
2262,louder.)

2264,SUMMERS: He's throwing a fit! 
2265,(The reptile comes over.)

2267,(The reptile bends to look at Girton's face. Summers and Lovell attack
2268,"but are thrown off as Ridgeway, with the weapon, and the Doctor come"
2269,down the ladder.) 
2270,"DOCTOR: No, no! Don't kill him! "
2271,(Ridgeway fires anyway.) 
2272,DOCTOR: There's no need to have done that! 
2273,"RIDGEWAY: Any more of them, Summers? "
2274,"SUMMERS: Yes, there's some more on guard up top, sir. "
2275,"RIDGEWAY: We've dealt with them already. Right, action stations! We're"

2352,again. 
2353,"WALKER: Well, well, well, so the heroes have returned. "
2354,"DOCTOR: Captain Hart, what idiot ordered an all out attack just as I"
2355,was on the verge of finding a peaceful solution? 
2356,JO: But it wasn't Captain Hart's fault. It was this 
2357,HART: I'm terribly sorry. This is Mister Walker. He's the Parliamentary
2358,Private Secretary in charge of this business. 
2359,WALKER: I'm the idiot you've just been talking about. Absolutely
2360,"splendid lunch, old man. "
2361,DOCTOR: You ordered the attack? 
2362,WALKER: I did. 
2363,"DOCTOR: Did you give any thought at all, sir, as to what you were"
2364,doing? 
2365,WALKER: Our duty is to destroy the Queen's enemies. Don't you know your
2366,"national anthem? Confound their politics, frustrate their knavish"
2367,tricks. 
2368,"DOCTOR: That, sir, is an extremely insular point of view. At the"
2369,"precise moment of the attack, I was negotiating a peace. "
2370,"WALKER: Peace? Huh. What, when they've been attacking our shipping and"
2371,"heaven alone knows what? I think you've got it all wrong, old man. Seek"
2372,"and destroy. That's what you chaps say, isn't it? "
2373,"DOCTOR: But the point, Mister Parliamentary Private Secretary, is that"
2374,"you have not destroyed. You have just made them angry. Very, very"
2375,angry! 
2376,"(So angry that hordes of reptiles are now emerging from the sea, taking"
2377,out the lone sentry on the beach and making their way through the base
2378,unopposed.) 
2379,"WALKER: I'm going to get on to the Minister, and I'm going to ask him"
2380,to seek approval for an immediate attack with nuclear weapons. 
2381,"DOCTOR: But that, sir, would be tantamount to murder. "
2382,"WALKER: Oh, come, come, Doctor. You speak as if these creatures are"
2383,"human. We're not going to hand over the world to a lot of lizards, you"
2384,know. 
2385,"DOCTOR: You can share it with them, surely? "
2386,"WALKER: Oh, come. Really, Doctor. "
2387,"DOCTOR: Look, let me make one final attempt to negotiate. "
2388,"WALKER: Well, you didn't get very far last time, did you? "
2389,"DOCTOR: Just you think of it, sir. Think of it. Wouldn't you like to be"
2390,"the man behind a peaceful settlement? Walker the peacemaker, they'd"
2391,call you. Or would you prefer to be known as the man responsible for
2392,launching a full scale war! 
2393,"WALKER: Look, you can actually communicate with these creatures? "
2394,DOCTOR: Yes. 
2395,WALKER: And you'd be willing to undertake the preliminary negotiations
2396,yourself? 
2397,DOCTOR: Just leave it to me. 
2398,"JO: Doctor, you're not thinking of going down there again? "
2399,"DOCTOR: Jo, it's the only way. "
2400,"JO: But, Doctor, it's far too dangerous! "
2401,"DOCTOR: Don't you understand, Jo? I've got to go down there of my own"
2402,"free will as a gesture of good faith. Captain Hart, is that diving"
2403,vessel still alongside? 
2404,"HART: Yes, but I must say that I agree with Miss Grant. "

2440, [Hart's office]
2441,
2442, DOCTOR: How do you hope to achieve that? 
2443,"MASTER: As you know, our friends here have underground and underwater"
2444,"bases all over the world. Well, I propose to reactivate them. "
2445,"DOCTOR: You haven't reactivated them yet, have you. "
2446,"MASTER: Er, not yet, no. But I can, with your help. "
2447,DOCTOR: I wondered why I was still alive. 
2448,"MASTER: I advise you not to give me any trouble, Doctor. Not if you"

2465,HART: Here. 
2466,(They clear equipment from a table.)

2469,and try to open it. 
2470,"WALKER: Yes, but supposing you get caught? They might take reprisals"

2488,outside.) 
2489,"MASTER: Now then, Doctor, my problem is this. During millions of years"
2490,"of hibernation, the reactivation machinery has deteriorated. I now find"
2491,it necessary to build a trigger mechanism for it. 
2492,DOCTOR: And how do you hope to do that? 
2493,"MASTER: Well, by constructing a sonar device analogous to the laser."
2494,"With this, I can not only pinpoint and revive the base by the sea fort,"
2495,but every other base in the world. 
2496,DOCTOR: And you've convinced your reptilian friends that this will
2497,work? 
2498,"MASTER: You know it'll work, with your cooperation. All the equipment"
2499,we need is here.

2502,DOCTOR: Good grief! What on Earth do you think you're doing? 
2503,MASTER: Why? What is the matter? 
2504,"DOCTOR: Well, this circuit here, it's completely misplaced. And also"
2505,you'll need far more power through to your main dipode. Give me a
2506,"pencil, will you? "
2507,MASTER: There you are. 
2508,DOCTOR: Thank you.

2701,"MASTER: Allow me, Doctor. We don't want any accidents this time. "
2702,"DOCTOR: The power may take some time to build up, you know. "
2703,(The Master switches the trigger mechanism on.) 
2704,MASTER: I suggest you now dispose of this man. 
2705,SEA DEVIL: Take them both to the cages. 
2706,MASTER: What's the meaning of this? I'm your ally! 
2707,"SEA DEVIL: Both, I say! Take them! "
2708,MASTER: I helped you! I helped you! 
2709,(An armada of surface vessels and submarines are approaching the
2710,Solent.) 
2711,"MASTER: Look, I demand you take me back to your chief! Immediately! "
2712,DOCTOR: You seem to be losing your touch. 
2713,[Sea Devil's base - cell]
2714,
2715, MASTER: Once they see that the device works
2716,"properly, they'll release me. "
2717,"DOCTOR: I very much doubt it. You see, before you reactivated it, I"
2718,reversed the polarity of the neutron flow. 
2719,MASTER: You did what? You realise what will happen? 
2720,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Do you? "
2721,"MASTER: Well, there'll be a massive reverse feedback into their whole"
2722,power system. 
2723,DOCTOR: Exactly. In about ten minutes from now the whole place should
2724,go up. Enjoy your revenge. 
2725,(The Master goes to the small porthole and shouts out.) 
2726,"MASTER: Guards! Guards, come back! You must release me! I must talk to"
2727,your chief! Let me out! We're all in danger! Let me out! 
2728,"DOCTOR: You're wasting your time, you know. Even if they heard you,"
2729,they couldn't do anything about it. 
2730,MASTER: Why? 
2731,"DOCTOR: Well, I built a self-destruct mechanism into the main control"
2732,switch. You can't turn it off. 
2733,MASTER: But but we'll both be killed. 
2734,DOCTOR: That's right. Unless we can both escape.

2737,
2738," BOWMAN: Ships moving into position now, sir. "
2739,WALKER: Very well. This time we'll continue the attack until those
2740,"creatures are finally destroyed. Now, how about some tea?"

2750," DOCTOR: Well, just as I told you. Submarine escape"
2751,"equipment. Now, all we've got to do is find the airlock. "
2752,MASTER: Airlock? 
2753,"DOCTOR: Yes, there must be one around here somewhere. Otherwise how"
2754,else did we get down in those capsules? Here you are. Put this on.

2763,
2764, HART: Won't be long now. 
2765,JO: Suppose the Doctor manages to escape from that place? 
2766,"HART: Not much chance, I'm afraid. "
2767,"JO: Yes, but just suppose? "
2768,HART: Get a high speed hovercraft over that area. I want a complete
2769,sweep before the attack. 
2770,"BOWMAN: Aye, aye, sir."
2771,
2772, [Hovercraft]
2773,
2774, (Two figures in orange survival suits are bobbing

2789,
2790," (Safely inside the craft, the Master clutches his"
2791,chest and falls to the floor. Then something under the sea goes KaBOOM

2795,
2796," BOWMAN: Large underwater explosion reported, sir. "
2797,WALKER: What? Has the attack started already? 
2798,"BOWMAN: No, sir, before the attack. And they've picked up two"
2799,survivors. One of them was in a bad way. They've radioed for an
2800,ambulance to stand by. 
2801,"JO: Did they, did they say who? "
2802,"BOWMAN: No, Miss."

2807,run down the shingle. The Doctor goes to meet Jo and Hart.) 
2808,JO: They said someone was hurt? 
2809,DOCTOR: It's the Master. He collapsed soon after they picked us up. 
2810,"HART: Well then, Doctor, what happened? "
2811,DOCTOR: I managed to destroy their base for you. 
2812,HART: Thank goodness. Well done. 
2813,"DOCTOR: Well, I did what I had to to prevent a war. "
2814,(The stretcher party come back with the Master.)

2817,DOCTOR: Doctor? What doctor? 
2818,(The Doctor removes a latex mask from the man on the stretcher.)
