22, (A retired couple are browsing amongst the
23,flowering trees and shrubs for sale.) 
24,"DORIS: Alastair, Alastair? "
25,(Everyone say Hi! to the age-defying Angela Douglas.) 
26,BRIGADIER: Mmm? 
27,DORIS: What about this one? 
28,"BRIGADIER: Oh fine, if you like it, Doris. "
29,"DORIS: Oh, show some enthusiasm. It'd look great by one of our azalea"
30,beds. What do you think? 
31,BRIGADIER: Yes. I'll plant it when we get home. 
32,"DORIS: Oh, thank you. "
33,"BRIGADIER: The exercise will do me good. Now, where's that salesman got"
34,to? Typical lack of efficiency. 
35,DORIS: Back in your soldier days you just had to give an order and
36,stand back. 
37,"BRIGADIER: Of course. Sergeant Benton, tree planting party, at the"
38,double! 
39,"DORIS: Sir! You don't regret it, do you? "
40,"BRIGADIER: What, giving up teaching? "
41,"DORIS: No, leaving United Nations Intelligence Taskforce. "

54,RICHARDS  :Salamander six zero reading you strength one. Over. 
55,"ZBRIGNIEV: Stand by, six zero. Brigadier, I've made contact with"
56,"Lieutenant Richards. Six zero, the Brigadier is coming now. "
57,(The Brigadier is a no-nonsense woman of part African or Caribbean
58,descent. Everyone say Hi! to  Angela Bruce.) 
59,"BAMBERA: Salamander six zero, please clarify your situation. Over. "
60,RICHARDS : Massive electrical disturbance. Over. 
61,"BAMBERA: Salamander six zero, you're breaking up. Over. (static)"
62,"Salamander, do you copy? "
63,(She gives up and walks round to the passenger side.) 
64,BAMBERA: Get that vehicle on the road ASAP. 
65,ZBRIGNIEV: They've gone. 
66,BAMBERA: Must be the storm.

72,(The sword is stuck into something at an angle
73,which points the throbbing gem towards a skylight. There is a
74,"cylindrical console and a crystal ball, which lights up with the face"
75,of  Jean

77,"Hartnell, twice.) "

83," ACE: Professor, why is it dark in here? "
84,"DOCTOR: Quiet, Ace. I'm working. "
85,"ACE: Oh, is that why it's dark? "
86,DOCTOR: Yes. 
87,ACE: What's that noise? 
88,DOCTOR: A cry in the dark. 
89,ACE: A distress signal? 
90,DOCTOR: A cry for help. Perhaps a summoning. 
91,ACE: Where's it coming from? 
92,"DOCTOR: Earth. Rippling out through the cosmos, forward in time,"
93,backwards in time and sideways in time. 
94,ACE: Sideways in time? 
95,"DOCTOR: Yes, sideways in time, across the boundaries that divide one"
96,universe from another. 
97,"ACE: Weird. This cry, who's it for? "
98,DOCTOR: For? I don't know. 
99,ACE: Perhaps if we went there? Where's it coming from again? 
100,DOCTOR: Earth. A few years in your future. 
101,ACE: It's giving me the creeps. What does it mean? 
102,"DOCTOR: We'll know in a moment, once we've deciphered it. "
103,VOICE : Merlin. Merlin.

114,me? Over. 
115,(Static.) 
116,ZBRIGNIEV: Brigadier. 
117,BAMBERA: What now? 
118,ZBRIGNIEV: Hitchhikers. 
119,(The Doctor and Ace have their thumbs out.) 
120,"BAMBERA: Oh, shame. "

122,
123, [Track] 
124," ACE: Don't stop, then! I don't care! "
125,(Ace sticks her thumb out at another Range Rover coming their way.) 
126,DOCTOR: I don't think this'll stop either. 
127,"ACE: Don't be such a pessimist, Professor. "
128,(The Range Rover with Carbury Trust painted on the side stops and
129,bearded Irishman James
130,Ellis calls over to them.) 
131,WARMSLY: Where are you heading? 
132,DOCTOR: North east. 
133,"WARMSLY: Right, climb aboard. Come to see the dig, have you? "
134,"DOCTOR: Ah, archaeological dig? "
135,"WARMSLY: Yes, actually. Oh, sorry, Haven't introduced myself. I'm Peter"
136,Warmsly. I'm site manager for the Carbury Trust Conservation Area. 
137, [Carbury Range Rover] 
138, (The Doctor gets into the passenger seat and Ace
139,gets in the back.) 
140,"ACE: I'm Ace, and this is the Doctor.Â "
141,"WARMSLY: The dig, as a matter of fact, is a hobby. A battlefield. "
142,ACE: What battlefield? 
143, (Something dives towards Earth. There is a whoosh
144,overhead.) 
145,"PETER: I hate that sound, don't you. Sometimes at night I lie there"
146,"listening, thinking it might be "
147,DOCTOR: The beginning of something terrible. 
148,(The object crashes into the side of a small hillock. BOOM!) 
149,ACE: What was that? 
150,PETER: The military use the area as a firing range. Never understood
151,why. 
152,DOCTOR: Blowing the occasional chunk out of the earth keeps them
153,amused. 
154,ACE: It didn't sound like a shell. 
155,(What looks like a knight in full armour rises from the crash site.)
156,
157,[Overlooking the lake]
158,
159,(Bambera gets out of the UNIT Range Rover and
160,surveys the scene by the lake. There are several trucks with
161,"camouflage netting on them, and UNIT soldiers running around. This"
162,"location is played by Hambleton Woods,Rutland) "
163,"BAMBERA: Oh, very good. Why not drive the missile into the lake? "
164,(They drive on and Warmsly stops in the same place. The Doctor and Ace
165,get out and Warmsly drives on. The Doctor then checks the wind
166,direction with his finger and gets out a gizmo with an antenna with a
167,large knob on the end.) 
168,ACE: Professor? 
169,DOCTOR: Yes. The transmission's definitely coming from over there. 
170,ACE: Professor. 
171,(Ace turns the Doctor around and the beeping from his gizmo gets
172,faster.) 
173,ACE: It's a missile convoy. 
174,DOCTOR: A nuclear missile convoy. 
175,ACE: How do you know? 
176,DOCTOR: It has a graveyard stench.
177,
178, [Convoy] 
179," (As two more space knights dive towards the Earth,"
180,Warmsly is haranguing a soldier.) 
181,WARMSLY: Warmsly's the name and I demand to see to somebody in charge. 
182,"(Bambera and Zbrigniev walk past the convoy truck, which has knocked"
183,over a Carbury Trust sign.) 
184,BAMBERA: What was that? 
185,ZBRIGNIEV: Low flying jet? 
186,BAMBERA: Not this far south. Raise Division. Get them to check flight
187,paths. 
188,ZBRIGNIEV: I'm sorry sir but we cannot get a signal out. 
189,"BAMBERA: Well, see what you can do, Zbrigniev. All this noise is making"
190,me nervous. 
191,(The soldier comes up to Zbrigniev and salutes.) 
192,SOLDIER: There's a Mister Warmsly who wants to speak to an officer. 
193,ZBRIGNIEV: Brigadier! There's a Mister Warmsly who wants to speak to
194,somebody in charge. 
195,"BAMBERA: You talk to him, Zbrigniev. I've got enough troubles. "
196,(Bambera goes inside a mobile command post. The Doctor and Ace duck
197,under a barrier across the track as something crashes to earth nearby.)
198,
199,ACE: Didn't sound like a shell. More like a couple of rockets. 
200,DOCTOR: Close. 
201,(They hide from running soldiers.) 
202,DOCTOR: What we need is something to help us. 
203,(He searches his pockets.) 
204,"DOCTOR: Wait a minute. Ah yes, of course! I never thought I'd need"
205,these again. 
206,(The Doctor takes a pair of passes from his hat and gives one to Ace.) 
207,DOCTOR: This should remove a few obstacles. 
208,ACE: Who's Elizabeth Shaw? I don't even look like her. 
209,"DOCTOR: Oh, never mind. Just think like a physicist. "
210,"(The knight, who is carrying a large gun as well as wearing a sword,"
211,walks away from its crash site.)
212,
213, [UNIT Mobile Command post]
214,
215," DOCTOR: Now, what seems to be the problem? "
216,BAMBERA: Excuse me? 
217,"DOCTOR: Well, you've had an explosion in your electronics, haven't you?"
218,
219,ACE: An electro-magnetic pulse effect. 
220,BAMBERA: Make yourself at home. 
221,DOCTOR: Caused by? 
222,"ACE: A nuclear explosion, usually. "
223,BAMBERA: I think I would have noticed a nuclear explosion. 
224,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, they are conspicuous. "
225,"ACE: Well, if there was no nuke, where did the energy pulse come from? "
226,DOCTOR: Exactly. 
227,BAMBERA: All systems failures were the result of a minor technical
228,difficulty. 
229,(Bambera holds up the UNIT passes.) 
230,"BAMBERA: I don't know where you got these from, but I intend to find"
231,out. Show these two out. 
232,DOCTOR: I'd just like to say three things. 
233,BAMBERA: What? 
234,"DOCTOR: Yeti, Autons, Daleks. Cybermen and Silurians! "
235, [Outside the Mobile Command post]
236,
237, (The Doctor and Ace come outside.) 
238,ACE: That was five things. 
239,DOCTOR: She didn't even notice. Among all the varied wonders of the
240,universe there's nothing so firmly clamped shut as the military mind.
241,
242, [UNIT Mobile Command post]
243,
244," BAMBERA: Well done, Zbrigniev. Two civilians waltz"
245,up with a pair of antiquated pass cards and you let them in. Why? 
246,ZBRIGNIEV: Sir. 
247,BAMBERA: You know something. What is it? 
248,"ZBRIGNIEV: Off the record, sir. "
249,BAMBERA: Off the record. 
250,"ZBRIGNIEV: When I served under Lethbridge Stewart, we had a scientific"
251,advisor called the Doctor. 
252,BAMBERA: The man outside. 
253,"ZBRIGNIEV: No, sir, but "
254,BAMBERA: But? 
255,"ZBRIGNIEV: He changed his appearance, several times. "
256,BAMBERA: A disguise. 
257,"ZBRIGNIEV: No, sir. The word was he changed his whole physical"
258,appearance. 
259,BAMBERA: His whole appearance. 
260,ZBRIGNIEV: And his personality. 
261,BAMBERA: How could he be the same man if his appearance and personality
262,have changed? 
263,"ZBRIGNIEV: I don't know, sir. "
264,"BAMBERA: What do you know, Zbrigniev? "
265,ZBRIGNIEV: Just that whenever this Doctor turns up 
266,BAMBERA: Yes? 
267,ZBRIGNIEV: All hell breaks loose.
268,
269, [Lethbridge- Stewart's garden]
270,
271," (At home in Fulmer, Buckinghamshire, the Brigadier"
272,is planting their newly purchased flowering tree. Doris answers the
273,cordless phone on the garden table.) 
274,DORIS: Alistair! Telephone for you. 
275,BRIGADIER: Who is it? 
276,"DORIS: Hello, can you tell me who's speaking? Okay, fine. thank you."
277,Geneva! 
278,"BRIGADIER: Oh, probably just another peace conference. Tell them I've"
279,retired. Tell them I'd decided to fade away. 
280,"DORIS: No, I'm terribly sorry, I'm afraid he's unavailable. Okay, yes,"
281,"I will. Thank you. Bye, bye. Alistair, that was the Secretary General. "
282,"BRIGADIER: Doris, I don't care if it was the King. I'm still retired. "
283,"DORIS: He said something about the Doctor being back. Alistair, who is"
284,the Doctor? 
285, (The Brigadier looks at his newly planted three.) 
286,BRIGADIER: I wonder how high it will get?  
287,[UNIT Range Rover]
288,
289," (Bambera drives past the Tardis, which has a"
290,knight hiding behind it.) 
291,"DOCTOR: We could have walked to the hotel, you know. "
292,BAMBERA: No problem. I thought you'd like to see Vortigern's Lake. 
293,DOCTOR: Vortigern. That's an interesting name. 
294,"ACE: Yeah, fascinating. "
295,"DOCTOR: What's your name, by the way? "
296,BAMBERA: Brigadier Winifred Bambera. 
297,ACE: Winifred? 
298,DOCTOR: There are many secrets in names. Vortigern is old British for
299,High King. 
300,ACE: Your convoy's stranded by the lake of the High King. 
301,"(Another knight, this time with a visible chin, examines a fallen sign"
302,saying MOD Firing Range - Keep Out.)
303,
304,  [Gore Crow Hotel]
305,
306,"(Played by Hambleton Old Hall, Rutland. Bambera"
307,stops next to a 2CV outside the hotel entrance. A young woman of Asian
308,extraction gets out of it and the Doctor raises his hat to her. Bambera
309,"drives off again. The Doctor and Ace go inside to the bar, where a"
310,woman is reading a Braille book. A man is clearing glasses from a
311,table.) 
312,PAT: Can I help you? 
313,DOCTOR: Yes. I'd like to book a room. One for myself and one for my
314,young friend here. 
315,"PAT: Yes, sir. Long journey? "
316,"DOCTOR: Er, quite a distance, as it happens. "
317,"PAT: Then you'll be having a drink, sir.Â "
318,"ACE: Yes, please. "
319,DOCTOR: Why not. What do you have? 
320,"PAT: What we have, sir, is possibly the finest beer in the area, even"
321,if I do say so myself. Perhaps the best in the country. 
322,DOCTOR: Really? 
323,SHOU: He makes it himself in a converted barn at the end of the garden.
324,
325,PAT: It's in the CAMRA guide. We call it Arthur's Ale. 
326,"SHOU: Vodka and coke, Pat. "
327,"DOCTOR: Glass of water, please. Ace? "
328,"ACE: Oh, vodka and "
329,DOCTOR: Ace? 
330,"ACE: Lemonade, please. "
331,SHOU: Good choice. 
332,ACE: Lemonade? 
333,SHOU: Anything but the beer. 
334,"DOCTOR: Hello, I'm The Doctor, and this is my friend "
335,SHOU: Ace. 
336,"PAT: There we are, sir. Five pounds, please. "
337,ACE: How much? 
338,"DOCTOR: Remember, we are in the future. "
339,(The Doctor tips a bag of various objects onto the counter.) 
340,"DOCTOR: There, a five pound piece. "
341,"PAT: Thank you, sir. "
342,(Shou picks up a thing with moving legs.) 
343,DOCTOR: Do you mind? It's a very valuable piece of coinage.
344,
345,[Track]
346,
347,(The UNIT Range Rover comes down the track and past
348,the Tardis.) 
349,"SOLDIER : Assume maximum alert. If the Doctor is involved, look out"
350,for a police telephone box. 
351,(The Range Rover comes to a sudden halt.) 
352,BAMBERA: Look out for what? 
353,(She reverses back to the Tardis and gets out.) 
354,"BAMBERA: Oh, shame. "
355,"(She draws her pistol and starts to go around the Tardis, then steps"
356,back and turns. The knight with the full helmet has a large weapon
357,"pointed at her. Just then, three other knights with visible chins"
358,appear and draw hand weapons. One shoots and his shot hits the Tardis.
359,"Bambera dives for cover as the first knight turns and shoots him, then"
360,fires her pistol. The first knight and another then use their swords.
361,She fires again at the third knight. A second knight joins in the sword
362,"fight, and the first one dodges so that they crash into each other,"
363,knocking themselves out. He picks his large weapon and leaves.)
364,
365, [Gore Crow Hotel]
366,
367, SHOU: So you've met Peter? 
368,DOCTOR: Mmm. Very knowledgeable fellow. 
369,"SHOU: Hmm, it's one way of putting it. He's got this thing about King"
370,Arthur. Digs things up out of the ground by the lake. 
371,"DOCTOR: Well, he is an archaeologist. "
372,"SHOU: Can't see it myself, all that patient scraping about. You know, I"
373,get the urge to bung half a kilo of TNT down the hole and bring it all
374,up in one go. 
375,ACE: Now you're talking! 
376,"DOCTOR: The point of archaeology is to carefully recover the past, not"
377,disintegrate it. 
378,SHOU: Wouldn't make much difference. The only half decent thing Peter's
379,ever found is that scabbard. 
380,"(An old brass-edged scabbard hanging by the fireplace, which has 1684"
381,carved into it. The Doctor goes over to examine it.) 
382,ACE: You could use something with more brisance. 
383,SHOU: More brisance? Than trinitrotoluene? Like what? 
384,DOCTOR: How remarkable. 
385,ACE: Tell you outside. 
386,SHOU: Why outside? 
387,ACE: He gets upset when I talk about explosives. 
388,(Ace and Shou leave. The blind woman speaks.) 
389,"ELIZABETH: Interesting, isn't it? "
390,DOCTOR: Yes. 
391,ELIZABETH: I wish I could see what it looks like. I can feel its
392,presence sometimes. Touch it. 
393,(The Doctor touches the scabbard.) 
394,"DOCTOR: My, it's hot. No, no. Now it's cold. "
395,ELIZABETH: Every so often I get the strangest feeling about it. 
396,DOCTOR: What kind of feeling? 
397,"ELIZABETH: Oh, that it's waiting for something. Stupid, really. "
398,"DOCTOR: Waiting for something, or someone."
399,
400, [Track]
401,
402, (The two stunned knights get up and run off.
403,Bambera comes out from behind the Tardis and goes to the Range Rover.
404,The rear nearside tyre is burning.) 
405,"BAMBERA: Oh, shame. "
406,(She takes the field telephone from the vehicle and starts walking.)

409,
410, (The Brigadier comes out of the house wearing his
411,old Army uniform and carrying a briefcase.) 
412,BRIGADIER: I'm surprised it still fits. 
413,DORIS: I should have thrown it out while I had the chance. 
414,(The briefcase contains the Brigadier's service revolver and 35 rounds
415,of ammunition.) 
416,"DORIS: And that, too. You could have said no. "
417,"BRIGADIER: I could have, Doris, but I still have my duty. "
418,"DORIS: This isn't duty. You want to go. I mean, do I? All this means so"
419,little to you. 
420,BRIGADIER: I will be coming back. 
421,DORIS: You don't need to go. You don't need to go on playing soldier
422,any more. 
423,BRIGADIER: I'm not playing.

426,
427,(Morgaine watches in the crystal ball as the four
428,knights converge on each other.) 
429,MORGAINE [in ball]: There is the enemy. Kill him. 
430,(They start shooting at each other. The lone knight's big weapon fells
431,a small tree.) 
432, [Gore Crow Hotel]
433,
434,(Bambera walks up the drive as Warmsly drives past
435,and parts in front of the hotel and storms inside. Elizabeth is
436,cleaning the bar.) 
437,"WARMSLY: Elizabeth! Ah, I need to use your telephone. The one in my car"
438,isn't working. 
439,(She pushes a candlestick phone to him. He speaks at it.) 
440,WARMSLY: Yes. Call. External. Sedgewick. Carbury Trust. 
441,"DOCTOR: Mister Warmsly, just the person. "
442,WARMSLY: There's a convoy just off the road by the lake with a nuclear
443,missile in. 
444,TELEPHONE: There is a fault on the line. There is a fault 
445,WARMSLY: Yes. Off. 
446,DOCTOR: This scabbard. 
447,WARMSLY: The line's dead. 
448,DOCTOR: This scabbard. Where did you find it? 
449,"WARMSLY: Here, locally. Why? "
450,DOCTOR: Where? 
451,WARMSLY: For the scabbard's worth 
452,BOTH: Ten of the sword. 
453,"WARMSLY: Said Merlin. Yeah. Hey, careful with it. It was found here, at"
454,the dig by the lake. 
455,(The Doctor takes the scabbard from the wall.) 
456,DOCTOR: What period? 
457,WARMSLY: Does it matter? Eighth century AD. 
458,(Warmsly hangs it back up.) 
459,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. It's been waiting around longer than that. "
460,WARMSLY: Waiting for what?

469,lawn. Doris comes out of the house with his swagger stick.)

471,"BRIGADIER: Oh, thank you. "
472,DORIS: You will be careful. 
473,BRIGADIER: Of course. I've always been careful. Don't worry. I'll sort
474,all this out and then come home. 
475,DORIS: Okay. They're waiting for you.

477, [Hotel garden] 
478," ACE: Well, it was obvious I was never going to be"
479,"the world's greatest artist. Anyway, Mrs Parkinson the art teacher"
480,"asked me what it is, right, so I told her it was a lump of school"
481,"plasticine. Well, I couldn't tell her what it really was. "
482,SHOU: The home made gelignite. 
483,"ACE: So, we're in the school corridor by now and Mrs Parkinson asks me"
484,to put what she thinks is school plasticine back in the art room. 
485,SHOU: So what did you do? 
486,(One of the warring knights takes out a hand grenade and pulls out the
487,pin with his teeth.) 
488,"ACE: I tossed it over my shoulder, like that. "
489,(The knight throws the grenade.) 
490,ACE: Landed right in the middle of class one C's prize winning pottery
491,pig collection. 
492,(The grenade lands at the sole knight's feet.) 
493,ACE: And boom! 
494,SHOU: Boom? 
495,ACE: Boom! 
496,"(The grenade goes BOOM, throwing the sole knight into the air.) "
497,SHOU: It's hit the brewery! 
498,(There is a smoking hole in the barn roof.) 
499,ACE: We'd better get the Doctor. 
500,(The Doctor comes out of the hotel.) 
501,DOCTOR: Good idea. Did you see it? 
502,ACE: Yeah. 
503,DOCTOR: And? 
504,ACE: It looked like a bloke. 
505,"DOCTOR: A bloke, flying through the air? "
506,SHOU: And then through a wall.
507,
508, [Outside the brewery]
509,
510," DOCTOR: You two, stay here. "
511,"ACE: Be serious, Professor. "
512,SHOU: What's going on? 
513,ACE: You'd better ask the Professor. 
514,SHOU: What's going on? 
515,DOCTOR: Shush.
516,
517, [Brewery] 
518, (It is dark inside. There are a few aluminium kegs
519,by the door.) 
520,ACE: Doctor? 
521,DOCTOR: Yes. 
522,ACE: I can't see anything. 
523,(Groan.) 
524,SHOU: What was that? 
525,(The Doctor finds the light switch. The knight in the full helmet is
526,sitting against a vat.) 
527,ACE: Is it an android? 
528,(The Doctor touches it carefully.) 
529,"DOCTOR: No, it's a human. "
530,"(The Doctor takes off the helmet to reveal a blond man, who opens his"
531,eyes and stares.) 
532,ANCELYN: Merlin. Against all hope. 
533,(Doris sighs as the Brigadier takes off in the helicopter.) 
534,SHOU: Merlin? 
535," ACE: You've got it wrong, mate. This is the Doctor. "
536,(Ancelyn removes his plate armour to reveal chain mail.) 
537,"ANCELYN: Oh, he has many faces, but in my reckoning, he is Merlin. "
538,"DOCTOR: You recognise my face, then? "
539,"ANCELYN: No, not your aspect, but your manner that betrays you. Do you"
540,not ride the ship of time? Does it not deceive the senses being larger
541,"within than out? Merlin, cease these games and tell me truly, is this"
542,the time? 
543,DOCTOR: Time for what? 
544,ANCELYN: Thou dost not know? Truly? 
545,"ACE: Do you think he'd be asking if he did, tin head? "
546,"ANCELYN: Why, the answer to Excalibur's call. The time of restitution."
547,The time when Arthur rises to lead the Britons to war. 
548,"DOCTOR: Vortigern's Lake, of course. Can you walk? "
549,SHOU: Can someone answer a simple question? 
550,"ACE: What's wrong, Doctor? "
551,SHOU: Can someone tell me what on Earth is going on? 
552,"DOCTOR: Well, if my hunch is right, the Earth could be at the centre of"
553,a war that doesn't even belong to this dimension. 
554,(Bambera enters with a sub-machine gun.) 
555,BAMBERA: Freeze! Everyone stand nice and easy. 
556,"DOCTOR: Listen, Winifred. We've got to be somewhere urgently, so please"
557,get out of the way. 
558,BAMBERA: You're all under arrest. You and your freaky friends. 
559,ACE: Who are you calling freaky? 
560,"DOCTOR: I can sort this out. Look, if I can just explain. "
561,(Boom! and the other group of knights enter.) 
562,MORDRED: Kill them! Kill them now. 
563, Part Two
564,
565, [Brewery] 
566, BAMBERA: I'm an armed military officer. You are
567,under arrest. Lay your weapons down and put your hands in the air. 
568,"DOCTOR: Winifred, this is not the way. "
569,BAMBERA: Put the guns down! 
570,(The Doctor knocks her gun down with his umbrella and walks up to the
571,knight in charge.) 
572,"DOCTOR: Listen, now that we're all here, let me introduce myself. I am"
573,the Doctor and this is 
574,(Bambera fires a shot that bounces off the knight's armour. The knight
575,laughs and raises his visor.) 
576,ANCELYN: Mordred. 
577,MORDRED: Ancelyn. Fitting that you should die amongst peasants. 
578,"ANCELYN: Look again, Mordred. "
579,DOCTOR: Do you recognise me? 
580,MORDRED: Merlin! 
581,ACE: Not again. 
582,MORDRED: You were bound. My mother sealed you into the ice caves for
583,all eternity. 
584,DOCTOR: I am the master of time. I cannot be bound so easily. 
585,MORDRED: Master of lies. 
586,"ANCELYN: Beware your tongue, Mordred. Have you so easily forgotten"
587,"Baden, hmm? The way he cast down your mother with his mighty arts. "
588,"DOCTOR: Yes, remember Baden and my mighty arts. Do you think I would"
589,"use mere trickery against someone as formidable as you? Go, before I"
590,unleash a terrible something on you. 
591,"ANCELYN: Go, Mordred, while you still live. "
592,"MORDRED: There will be a reckoning, Ancelyn. I have sworn it. As for"
593,"you, Merlin, my mother has waited twelve centuries to face you. You"
594,will bow down before her this time. 
595,"(The knights leave the way they came, presumably through a hole blown"
596,in the wall.) 
597,ACE: Who was he? 
598,"DOCTOR: That was Mordred, and his mother is Morgaine, a mighty"
599,sorceress. 
600,SHOU: You know these guys then? 
601,DOCTOR: Never met them before. 
602, [Helicopter] 
603, (The Brigadier's French lady UNIT pilot uses the
604,radio.) 
605,"LAVEL: ATC Docklands, this Uniform November niner zero. Request"
606,"clearance for London Central. Over. Thank you, Docklands. Over. We are"
607,"clear all the way to London, sir. "
608,"BRIGADIER: Right, I want an exclusion zone around the whole of the"
609,"Carbury area, extending for one mile. One and a half kilometres outside"
610,the limit of radio jamming. 
611,"LAVEL: I'm sorry, sir, but the bulk of the European UNIT"
612,commitment is handling the Azanian ceasefire. 
613,"BRIGADIER: Well, who's left? "
614,LAVEL: The Czech engineering group. Flood relief in the low countries.
615,They can be at the site by tomorrow. 
616,BRIGADIER: Put it into motion. 
617, LAVEL: Sir. 
618,"BRIGADIER: Oh, and Lavel? "
619,LAVEL: Sir? 
620,"BRIGADIER: The officer who requested the information on the Doctor,"
621,"this Brigadier Bambera. Good man, is he? "
622, [Hotel grounds] 
623," DOCTOR: Brigadier Bambera, if we're going to work"
624,"together, you've got to stop shooting at everything that moves. "
625,"(The Doctor, Ace and Shou Yuing walk on. Bambera stops Ancelyn, who has"
626,taken off the chain mail to reveal a padded jacket.) 
627,BAMBERA: Not you. I want to talk to you. 
628,"ANCELYN: I am Ancelyn ap Gwalchmai, Knight General of the Britons. I do"
629,not talk to peasants. 
630,(Bambera grabs Ancelyn.) 
631,BAMBERA: You'll talk to me. 
632,(Bambera and Ancelyn fight.) 
633,ACE: Professor! 
634,"DOCTOR: Oh, ignore them. They're just establishing their credentials. "
635,ACE: They've got a funny way of doing it. 
636,DOCTOR: Don't worry about them. 
637,SHOU: What should we worry about? 
638,DOCTOR: Sorcery. 
639,"(In the spacecraft, we now see the body of a knight slumped across the"
640,stone pedestal the sword is sticking out of.) 
641, [Castle] 
642, (Lightning flashes around the tower and
643,"battlements of a empty building nearby, with boarded up windows. Played"
644,"by Wolthorpe Towers, Stamford, Lincolnshire.) "
645,MORDRED: Here is the convocation. This we make the meeting place. The
646,point between two worlds. 
647,(Two globes either side of Mordred light up.) 
648,MORDRED: Two universes. Two realities. 
649, [Gore Crow Hotel] 
650, (Night has fallen. The scabbard is quivering on
651,the wall as the Doctor looks out of the curtains in the bar.) 
652,DOCTOR: No one's to go outside. 
653,ELIZABETH: I heard gunshots earlier. 
654,DOCTOR: Exactly. 
655,PAT: Why not? 
656,DOCTOR: There are things out there in the dark you wouldn't want to
657,meet. 
658,(Bang!) 
659,WARMSLY: What was that? 
660,"(Bambera brings Ancelyn in from the grounds, handcuffed.) "
661,"BAMBERA: Come on, move it, will you. Get in. Brigadier Bambera. "
662,DOCTOR: What happened to you? 
663,"ANCELYN: She vanquished me, and I threw myself on her mercy. "
664,"BAMBERA: As of now, I'm in charge. Everyone remain calm. We'll soon"
665,have everything under control. 
666,(The Doctor notices the scabbard.) 
667,DOCTOR: I doubt that. 
668, [Castle] 
669," MORDRED: By this sword, brother to Excalibur, I"
670,part the curtain of night. 
671, [Gore Crow Hotel] 
672, WARMSLY: What's that noise? 
673,PAT: What noise? 
674,(The scabbard flies across the room and sticks point first into the
675,upright timber by Warmsly. Glasses fall off the shelves behind the
676,bar.) 
677,WARMSLY: That noise! 
678,DOCTOR: Which way does that wall face? 
679,"WARMSLY: Excuse me, but three inches to the left "
680,"PAT: North, towards the lake. "
681, [Helicopter] 
682, (The Brigadier is taking a nap.) 
683,ATC : Docklands ATC to Uniform November niner zero.
684,Clear for final approach. Over. 
685," LAVEL: Roger, Docklands ATC. Commencing approach now."
686,"We'll be landing in London shortly, sir. "
687, [Castle] 
688," MORDRED: Across the abyss, life calls to life,"
689,"biomass to biomass, energy to energy. To Avallion I summon thee from"
690,beyond the confines of this universe. 
691,(Mordred stabs his sword into the floor. There is a small explosion.
692,The Brigadier suddenly wakes. Mordred laughs.) 
693, [Gore Crow Hotel] 
694, (More glasses fall and the lights flicker.) 
695,BAMBERA: Another storm. Just what we need. 
696,DOCTOR: Stay where you are. 
697,(The chandelier is swinging in a circle. A few more glasses fall.) 
698,WARMSLY: An earthquake? 
699,(Ace and Shou run in.) 
700,SHOU: Doctor! 
701,"BAMBERA: What's going on, Doctor? "
702,"DOCTOR: I don't know, but I've got some nasty suspicions. "
703,(The Doctor pulls the scabbard from the post and tries to hold on to
704,it. Mordred finishes his long laugh and walks out of the circle of
705,light.)Â 
706,SHOU: An earthquake? In England? 
707,DOCTOR: No. Someone is creating a rip in the fabric of time and space. 
708,ANCELYN: She is coming. 
709,BAMBERA: What are you talking about? Who's coming? 
710,ACE: You can feel it? 
711,DOCTOR: Yes. I'm uniquely sensitive. Argh! Gah! 
712,"(The Doctor falls to his knees, still clutching the scabbard for dear"
713,life.) 
714,ACE: Doctor! What is it? 
715, [Castle] 
716, (Morgaine appears in the circle vacated by
717,Mordred.) 
718,"MORDRED: Immortal Morgaine, ageless and deathless. "
719,MORGAINE: Mordred. 
720,"MORDRED: Mother, Merlin is here. "
721,"MORGAINE: Yes, I can feel his presence. "
722,MORDRED: He has a new countenance. 
723,"MORGAINE: He has worn many faces. Merlin, hear me. "
724, [Gore Crow Hotel] 
725, DOCTOR: (through gritted teeth) I hear you. 
726, [Castle] 
727," MORGAINE: Do not stand against me this time, for"
728,your soul's sake. 
729, [Gore Crow Hotel] 
730, DOCTOR: I cannot allow your interference. 
731, [Castle] 
732," MORGAINE: Then, Merlin, let this be our last"
733,battlefield. 
734,"(She raises her arms, the lightning flashes, and over in the hotel the"
735,lights go out and people scream.) 
736, [Gore Crow Hotel] 
737, (The next morning is fine. The Doctor collects
738,Ancelyn's sword and Bambera's beret from the grounds and tiptoes
739,"through the bar where the two antagonists are sleeping, resting against"
740,"each other. Putting them on the bar, he picks up an empty crisp packet,"
741,inflates it and bursts it. Bambera and Ancelyn leap to their feet ready
742,for action.) 
743,DOCTOR: Good morning. 
744, [Helicopter] 
745," LAVEL: How did it go, sir? "
746,"BRIGADIER: Oh, usual bureaucracy. Inch thick forms and half a pint of"
747,blood. 
748,LAVEL: That's London for you. 
749,BRIGADIER: Funny how it looks beautiful at sunrise. 
750,LAVEL: Never noticed. Seen one heliport and you've seen them all. Where
751,"now, sir? "
752,"BRIGADIER: Carbury, where the action is. "
753, [Dig site] 
754, (The broken down UNIT convoy is very close to the
755,open archeological trenches.) 
756,DOCTOR: And you excavated all this yourself? 
757,"WARMSLY: Labour of love, really. "
758,DOCTOR: Impressive. 
759,WARMSLY: And I did have some help from Shou Yuing. 
760,DOCTOR: And where did you find the scabbard? 
761,WARMSLY: By that marker. 
762,ACE: How long did it take? 
763,"WARMSLY: Oh, about ten years so far. "
764,ACE: Ten years? 
765,WARMSLY: Archeology is a precise and delicate skill. History has to be
766,eased out of the earth one painstaking layer at a time. 
767,ACE: I still think ten years is a bit of a long time. 
768,(She squats in a trench and uses a brush to remove some soil from
769,carved stones.) 
770,ACE: What's this? 
771,"WARMSLY: Ah, now that's a bit of a mystery. No one's been able to"
772,decipher the carving. 
773,"DOCTOR: It says, Dig Hole Here. "
774,WARMSLY: Extraordinary. What does it say that in? 
775,"DOCTOR: My handwriting. Ace, we need a hole. "
776,(Ace gets a canister of Nitro Nice from her jacket pocket.) 
777,ACE: Right. How long? 
778,"DOCTOR: Er, sixty seconds should be long enough. "
779,WARMSLY: Long enough for what? 
780,(The Doctor leads Warmsly away as Ace sets the timer.) 
781,DOCTOR: Nothing to worry about. My young friend's something of an
782,expert. 
783,"WARMSLY: What, in archeology? "
784,"DOCTOR: No, explosives. "
785,WARMSLY: What? 
786,(Ace runs up to them.) 
787,DOCTOR: Down! 
788,(Boom! as they dive into another trench.) 
789,DOCTOR: Ace? 
790,ACE: I think the timer needs work. 
791,DOCTOR: One of these days we're going to have a nice long talk about
792,acceptable safety standards. 
793, [Helicopter] 
794, BRIGADIER: Has Major Husak reported in yet? 
795,"LAVEL: No, sir. London says that the area of radio interference is"
796,expanding. 
797,"BRIGADIER: Well, see if you can raise him from here. Can you speak"
798,Czechoslovakian? 
799,"LAVEL: Only when I'm drunk, sir. "
800, [Woods] 
801, (Bambera and Ancelyn are jogging through the
802,trees.) 
803,BAMBERA: He'd better not be gone when we get there. 
804,ANCELYN: You cannot hold the Doctor. He goes where he will. 
805,"BAMBERA: Shut up and run, Ancelyn. "
806,ANCELYN: My lady. 
807,BAMBERA: You call me my lady once more and I'll break your nose. 
808, [Helicopter] 
809, LAVEL: I can't see anybody around. 
810,BRIGADIER: Looks like some damage to that barn. 
811,LAVEL: I can see a possible landing zone. Everything looks peaceful. 
812,"BRIGADIER: Yes, very peaceful. Are you armed, Lieutenant? "
813,"LAVEL: Yes, sir. "
814,"BRIGADIER: Well, check it's loaded and take us in. "
815, [Churchyard] 
816, (Morgaine and Mordred are standing amongst the
817,"graves of Saint Andrews Church, Hambleton.) "
818,MORGAINE: What can you see? 
819,MORDRED: A flying machine. Tis like an ornithopter but with whirling
820,blades for wings. 
821,MORGAINE: The people of this world are obsessed with machinery. 
822,MORDRED: It would seem so. 
823,"MORGAINE: Well then, let us teach them the limitations of their"
824,technologies. 
825,(Morgaine fires energy bolts from her claw-like fingernails and the
826,helicopter starts smoking.) 
827, [Helicopter] 
828, (Smoke comes into the cockpit.) 
829,"LAVEL: Malfunction, sir. "
830,BRIGADIER: What? 
831,LAVEL: It felt like something hit us. This could be rough. 
832,(The helicopter flies downwards.) 
833, [Dig site] 
834, (Ace peers into the massive hole she has made.) 
835,ACE: What's down there? 
836,WARMSLY: Don't ask me. I've only been excavating this site for ten
837,years. 
838,"DOCTOR: With a bit of luck, a tunnel. "
839,"ACE: A dark, mysterious one? "
840,DOCTOR: Probably. 
841,ACE: Leading to unknown dangers? 
842,DOCTOR: Indubitably. 
843,(They slither down the side of the pit.) 
844,"ACE: Oh, wicked! "
845,"DOCTOR: Peter, Ace and I are going to investigate this tunnel. You stay"
846,here and guard it. Don't let anyone come in here. 
847,"WARMSLY: What am I supposed to do, lecture them on archeology? "
848,DOCTOR: Yes. 
849, [Helicopter] 
850, BRIGADIER: Can you get us down? 
851,LAVEL: Down is not the problem. 
852,(The helicopter is close to the tree tops.) 
853, [Tunnel] 
854, ACE: It's damp. 
855,"DOCTOR: Well, we are under the lake. "
856,ACE: And this wall's made of concrete. 
857,DOCTOR: Hmm. It's gone soft with age. This was built in the eighth
858,century. 
859,ACE: But they didn't have concrete in those days. 
860,"DOCTOR: No, they didn't. "
861,ACE: Thought so. 
862,(The tunnel seals behind them.) 
863,ACE: Doctor? 
864,"DOCTOR: Don't worry, Ace. It's only a trap. "
865, [Clearing] 
866," (The Brigadier and Lavel run from the helicopter,"
867,which then explodes.) 
868,"BRIGADIER: Five million pounds worth of aircraft, and we've lost it. "
869,LAVEL: If they make us pay for that 
870,BRIGADIER: We'll be poor for the rest of our lives. 
871,(Lavel's leg hurts.) 
872,BRIGADIER: Pulled a ligament? 
873,LAVEL: Oh good. I thought it might be something serious. 
874,BRIGADIER: I'll see if I can get some help from the village. 
875,"LAVEL: But sir, we don't know what the situation is here. "
876,"BRIGADIER: The situation, Lavel, is normal. It doesn't get much worse"
877,"than that. You know, I think I'm rather enjoying this. "
878,(The Brigadier takes his service revolver from its holster and heads
879,off.) 
880, [Churchyard] 
881, (Mordred is reading the names on the war
882,memorial.) 
883,MORDRED: Tis a shrine to those fallen in battle. 
884,"MORGAINE: So, they are not the savages you led us to believe. You"
885,fought on their soil without proper respect for the dead. 
886,"MORDRED: Mother, I "
887,"MORGAINE: You have dishonoured us, Mordred. What is victory without"
888,honour? Leave us! 
889,(Mordred walks through two lines of knights. The Brigadier walks up the
890,road by the church.) 
891,MORGAINE: What manner of man are you? 
892,(Morgaine and the Brigadier meet at the church gate. The Brigadier
893,points his revolver at her.) 
894,"MORGAINE: A warrior, no less. How goes the day? "
895,BRIGADIER: I've had better. 
896,"MORGAINE: I am Morgaine, the sun killer. Dominator of the thirteen"
897,worlds and Battle Queen of the S'Rax. What say you? 
898,"BRIGADIER: I am Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. Surrender now, and we can"
899,avoid bloodshed. 
900, [Dig site] 
901, (Bambera and Ancelyn arrive.) 
902,BAMBERA: Where's the Doctor? 
903,WARMSLY: Did you know that it takes one year to uncover one centimetre
904,"on a site this big? But now, delay not. Take the sword and fling him"
905,far into the middle mere. Watch what thou seest and lightly bring me
906,word. 
907,"(Arthur, Lord Tennyson, Idylls of the King.) "
908, [Spacecraft entrance] 
909," (Ace is sitting in a giant carved fishes mouth,"
910,which is the entrance to the rest of the craft but has a metal door
911,across it.) 
912,DOCTOR: Ancelyn's people must have built this tunnel. 
913,ACE: Looks fishy to me. 
914,DOCTOR: This is no place for humour. 
915,ACE: Professor? 
916,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
917,ACE: Where does Ancelyn come from? 
918,DOCTOR: Another dimension. Sideways in time from another universe. 
919,"ACE: Not a local boy, then. "
920,"DOCTOR: The question is, how do we get through here? "
921, [Graveyard] 
922, BRIGADIER: Let me see if I've understood you
923,correctly. You are holding a Remembrance ceremony for the dead of our
924,"World Wars, a ceasefire to remain in force for the duration of said"
925,"ceremony, right? "
926,"MORGAINE: Your words are strange, but that is the meaning, yes. "
927,BRIGADIER: Right. What must I do? 
928, [Spacecraft entrance] 
929, ACE: No coded pattern? 
930,DOCTOR: No hidden switches. 
931,"ACE: Well, how are we going to get through the door, then? "
932,DOCTOR: Open up. It's me. 
933,(The door rises.) 
934, [Graveyard] 
935, MORGAINE: I wish you to know that I bear you no
936,malice. 
937,BRIGADIER: I understand. 
938,"MORGAINE: But when we meet again, I shall kill you. "
939,"(And she does/did, in  The Dalek's Master Plan."
940,The knights follow Morgaine out into the village.) 
941, [Spacecraft entrance] 
942, ACE: I refuse to ask how you did that. How did you
943,do that? 
944,"DOCTOR: Well, it came to me that it wasn't Ancelyn's people who built"
945,this tunnel. It was Merlin. 
946,ACE: But everyone thinks that you're Merlin. 
947,DOCTOR: Exactly. Door keyed to my voice pattern. Just the sort of thing
948,I would do. 
949,ACE: Are you Merlin? 
950,"DOCTOR: No. But I could be, in the future. That is, my personal future."
951,Which could be the past. 
952,ACE: Right.

958,"BRIGADIER: The keys, please "
959,SHOU: What? 
960,BRIGADIER: The keys. Thank you.

964, [Spacecraft] 
965,  (The Doctor leads the way up a spiral
966,staircase.) 
967,ACE: This is a spaceship? 
968,DOCTOR: More than that. It's a craft for travelling between dimensions.
969,
970,ACE: It's more like being in some huge animal. Who built it? 
971,"DOCTOR: It wasn't built, it was grown. "
972,ACE: Who grows spaceships? 
973,DOCTOR: Very advanced bioengineers. 
974,"ACE: Ask a stupid question. Well, if they're grown, how do they fly? "
975,DOCTOR: Magic. 
976,"ACE: Oh, be feasible, Professor. "
977,DOCTOR: What is Clarke's law? 
978,ACE: Any advanced form of technology is indistinguishable from magic. 
979,"DOCTOR: Well, the reverse is true. "
980,ACE: Any advanced form of magic is indistinguishable? 
981,(They arrive at the chamber with the knight and the sword in the
982,stone.) 
983,ACE: From technology. 
984, ACE: Seen one spaceship you've seen them all. 
985,"DOCTOR: Don't be so cynical, Ace. "
986,(They have reached the main chamber with the sword.) 
987,ACE: Wow. 
988,DOCTOR: Impressive. 
989,"ACE: That's Arthur, King of the Britons, isn't it? "
990,"DOCTOR: The legendary Arthur, yes. From another dimension, where the"
991,man was closer to the myth. But what is he doing here? 
992,ACE: Not a lot. Is he in suspended animation? 
993,DOCTOR: Who knows? 
994,ACE: In eternal sleep until England's greatest need. 
995,"DOCTOR: Ace, don't touch that. "
996,"ACE: Oh, it's all right, Professor. It's not like I'm King of the"
997,"Britons, is it? "
998,(Ace pulls the sword from the stone and falls backwards.) 
999,"DOCTOR: No, Ace! "
1000,ACE: Gordon Bennett! 
1001,DOCTOR: I hope you haven't disturbed anything. 
1002,ACE: It disturbed me. 
1003,"DOCTOR: Well, I only hope you haven't disturbed anything else! "
1004,ACE: Like what? 
1005,DOCTOR: Like that. Look! 
1006,ACE: Where? 
1007,DOCTOR: I think I saw something over there. 
1008,(A green thing with a snake's head glides into the room.) 
1009,"DOCTOR: Ace, I think it's time for plan B. "
1010,ACE: We run? 
1011,"DOCTOR: Yes, run! "
1012,ACE: There's no way out! 
1013,DOCTOR: Now is not the time to panic! 
1014,(The energy snake knocks the Doctor across the room.) 
1015,ACE: Doctor! 
1016,DOCTOR: Now we panic! 
1017,"ACE: It's some sort of automated defence system, isn't it. "
1018,"DOCTOR: Yes. When I say run, run! "
1019,"(The snake hits the Doctor again, and Ace runs to what looks like an"
1020,escape hatch.) 
1021,DOCTOR: Not that way! 
1022,"ACE: Doctor, it's a dead end! "
1023,"(The door closes, trapping Ace inside.) "
1024,ACE: (silent) Doctor! 
1025,"DOCTOR: Hang on, Ace. "
1026,(Water floods into the escape hatch. Ace is screaming for the Doctor
1027,and hammering on the door.) 
1028,DOCTOR: I'm coming!

1038,Doctor down once again.)

1040, (Warmsly is giving Ancelyn a tour of the site.) 
1041,"WARMSLY: Yes, this site is where Arthur is supposed to have met Mordred"
1042,"in the final battle, and this lake, where Bedivere threw Excalibur. "
1043,ANCELYN: What do you know of Excalibur? 
1044,"WARMSLY: King Arthur's sword, Excalibur, wrought by the lonely maiden"
1045,"of the lake, who rose up out of the water holding the sword Excalibur"
1046,aloft. 
1047,ANCELYN: This lake? 
1048,"WARMSLY: Thou rememberest how, in those old days, one summer noon, an"
1049,"arm rose up from out the bosom of the lake clothed in white samite,"
1050,"mystic, wonderful, holding the sword. And how I rode across"
1051,"and took it, and have worn it, like a king. It's all a myth,"
1052,"really. Honestly, women in water holding swords?"
1053,"(Bambera stares as a sword rises point first from the waters, followed"
1054,by an arm clothed in black nylon belonging to a spluttering Ace.) 
1055,BAMBERA: Look! 
1056,WARMSLY: It's that wretched girl! 
1057,(Ace runs onto the shore.) 
1058,BAMBERA: What are you doing in the lake? 
1059,"ACE: Drowning. Here, you can be King of England. "
1060,(Ace hands the sword to Ancelyn. 
1061,ANCELYN: It's Excalibur. 
1062,"ACE: That's what I said, Shakespeare. "
1063,BAMBERA: Where's the Doctor? 
1064,"ACE: In a spaceship, down there! He's in trouble. We've got to help"
1065,him. 
1066,(The Brigadier and Shou arrive in her 2CV.)

1071,little tapeworm. 
1072,(The energy snake knocks the Doctor over and he drops the control unit.
1073,He makes a grab for it and ends up lying next to Arthur. Then someone's

1075,vanishes.) 
1076,DOCTOR: (cough) Oh. 
1077,"BRIGADIER: I just can't let you out of my sight, can I, Doctor? "
1078,DOCTOR: Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart. So you recognise
1079,"me, then? "
1080,BRIGADIER: Yes. Who else would it be?

1088,"WARMSLY: Well, I "
1089,"BAMBERA: Down there, in a trap. "
1090,ACE: Yeah. Let's you in but it doesn't let you out. 
1091,"WARMSLY: Yes, well, Ace got out all right. "
1092,BAMBERA: But the Doctor is still down there. 
1093,SHOU: And the Brigadier. 
1094,BAMBERA: I am the Brigadier. 
1095,BRIGADIER: So am I. 
1096,(The Brigadier comes out of the tunnel.) 
1097,"ACE: Hey, I thought it let you in but it doesn't let you out. "
1098,DOCTOR: It let me out. 
1099,"BAMBERA: Brigadier, I thought you'd retired. "
1100,"BRIGADIER: So did I, Brigadier. Now, is the perimeter secure?"
1101,This whole area is crawling with armed extra-terrestrials and they're

1113, ANCELYN: My lord Merlin. 
1114,BRIGADIER: Merlin? 
1115,"ANCELYN: Oh, he has many names. "
1116,BRIGADIER: He has many faces. And he has many companions. This must be
1117,the latest one. 
1118,BAMBERA: We've checked the perimeter. Doctor Warmsly is staying with
1119,the vehicles.Â 
1120,"BRIGADIER: Oh, thank you, Bambera. Oh, see if you can get a blanket for"
1121,"this young lady, will you? "
1122,"BAMBERA: Yes, sir. Perhaps I should make some tea, too. "
1123,(Bambera leaves.) 
1124,"BRIGADIER: Well, are you all right, Miss? "
1125,"ACE: Just call me the latest one, and I can get my own blanket. "

1202,(A knight throws a grenade which explodes next to the Range Rover. The
1203,vehicle swerves but keeps going. The Knight Commander signals his men
1204,to open fire.)

1209,WARMSLY: Who were they? 
1210,"BRIGADIER: Now, Doctor, we've been attacked. Happy? "
1211,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1212,"BRIGADIER: Oh, good. "
1213,"DOCTOR: As long as Morgaine's people are shooting at us, she won't be"
1214,using more obscure methods of attack.

1226,an alternative dimension? 
1227,ANCELYN: Yes.

1261,ELIZABETH: I can do it myself. 
1262,PAT: You'll have to excuse my wife. Half an hour ago she was blind.

1270,"BRIGADIER: Don't worry, Major. You'll soon get the hang of it. Oh, this"
1271,"is the Doctor. Yeah, well, don't let him baffle you. And this is Peter"
1272,Warmsly. 
1273,"HUSAK: Ah, Mister Warmsly. If you'd join Mister Rawlinson in the"
1274,"vehicle, we'll evacuate you from the area. "
1275,"PAT: Excuse me, there are a few questions I want answered. "
1276,WARMSLY: And I have absolutely no intention of being evacuated. This
1277,area is where I live. 
1278,DOCTOR: You're very angry. 
1279,PAT: Of course we're angry. 
1280,DOCTOR: And you want to leave. 
1281,"WARMSLY: No, we do not want to leave. "
1282,(The Doctor gives Pat a Look.) 
1283,DOCTOR: Of course you want to leave. 
1284,PAT: Of course we do. 
1285,"DOCTOR: I wouldn't stand for any nonsense, if I were you. "
1286,"WARMSLY: Look, Doctor, the situation is perfectly simple. We are very"
1287,angry and we 
1288,(Warmsly gets the Look.) 
1289,"WARMSLY: Want to leave. Is that right, Pat? "
1290,PAT: Don't get in our way. 
1291,DOCTOR: I wouldn't dream of it. 
1292,PAT: Just no reasoning with these people. 
1293,(Pat and Warmsly go to the truck.) 
1294,"HUSAK: At the risk of being baffled, sir, I have one more evacuee on my"
1295,list. A young lady. 
1296,(Ace and Shou Yuing are nowhere in sight.) 
1297,DOCTOR: She seems to have disappeared. 
1298,"BRIGADIER: Well, there you have it, Major. "
1299,"(Major Husak salutes the Brigadier, then turns and reluctantly salutes"
1300,the Doctor before leaving.) 
1301,DOCTOR: You've got enough weapons here to fight a war. 
1302,BRIGADIER: That's the general idea. 
1303,"DOCTOR: It'll be useless, Brigadier. "
1304,"BRIGADIER: Not this time, Doctor. Over here! "
1305,(A soldier brings a small ammunition box.) 
1306,"BRIGADIER: Open that box, will you? "
1307,(The Brigadier takes out a large bullet.) 
1308,"BRIGADIER: Armour piercing, solid core, with a Teflon coating. Go"
1309,through a Dalek. 
1310,DOCTOR: A non-stick bullet. 
1311,"BRIGADIER: UNIT's been very busy, Doctor. We've also got high-explosive"
1312,rounds for Yeti's and very efficient armour-piercing rounds for robots.
1313,And we've even got gold-tipped bullets for you know what. 
1314,DOCTOR: No silver? 
1315,BRIGADIER: Silver bullets? 
1316,"DOCTOR: Well, you never know. "
1317,BRIGADIER: Quartermaster Sergeant! Silver bullets. Have we any? 
1318,(The evacuation truck drives off. Ace peers round the wall. She is
1319,holding Excalibur.) 
1320,"ACE: You can come out now, they've gone. "
1321,SHOU: That was close. I nearly got evacuated. 
1322,ACE: You may wish you had. 
1323, [Gore Crow Hotel] 
1324, (Ace and Shou enter as the Doctor pays
1325,his respects to the remains of Lt Lavel.) 
1326,ACE: What's that? 
1327,DOCTOR: A shadow. 
1328,"ACE: Professor, we've sussed out where the legend of King Arthur came"
1329,from. 
1330,"BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, miss, er, young lady, but the Doctor and I have"
1331,important matters to discuss. 
1332,ACE: We reckon that when Ancelyn's lot dumped the freeze-dried king in
1333,the lake they must have told the story to some local. 
1334,SHOU: But they couldn't handle the more outrï¿½ aspects. 
1335,ACE: So they translated it into terms they could understand. And so old
1336,frozen chicken becomes King of the Britons. 
1337,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, I really must "
1338,"DOCTOR: No, Brigadier, this is important. "
1339,ACE: Since that's Excalibur 
1340,DOCTOR: It must be the source of Arthur's power. 
1341,ACE: And a vital control element to the spaceship under the lake. It
1342,"wasn't stuck in the stone, it was plugged in. "
1343,DOCTOR: Could be. 
1344,ACE: I bet Ancelyn knows. Knew. 
1345,BRIGADIER: Major Husak is leading a detachment to recover the bodies of
1346,Brigadier Bambera and Ancelyn. 
1347,ACE: What good are their bodies? 
1348,"BRIGADIER: UNIT looks after its own, alive or dead, and I want these"
1349,ashes buried with honour.

1352,beret. Husak radios in.)

1356, BRIGADIER: Doctor! Bambera and Ancelyn are alive. 
1357,DOCTOR: They're alive? 
1358,BRIGADIER: And Major Husak said they seem to be heading north from
1359,here. 
1360,DOCTOR: Towards the missile convoy. 
1361,BRIGADIER: Yes. Bambera's own unit is there. 
1362,DOCTOR: But if they lead Morgaine's troops 
1363,BRIGADIER: It's a fully armed nuclear missile. 
1364,DOCTOR: If there's an accident. We'd better stop any engagement. Have
1365,you got a helicopter available? 
1366,"BRIGADIER: Oh, better than that, Doctor. "

1371,"BRIGADIER: Well, I knew how fond of it you were, so when you last went"
1372,on your travels I had it put in mothballs. 
1373,(The Doctor tries the bulb horn.) 
1374,ACE: Does it run on petrol or steam? 
1375, [Woods] 
1376, (Ancelyn briefly fights a knight before raising
1377,his sword for the coup de grace with a yell.) 
1378,BAMBERA: Ancelyn! Ancelyn! Can't you do anything quietly? 
1379,(The knight runs away.) 
1380,BAMBERA: You're going to bring Morgaine's whole army down on us. 
1381,ANCELYN: Let them come. Do you not know I am the best knight in the
1382,world? 
1383,BAMBERA: Ancelyn. 
1384,"ANCELYN: Yes, my lady? "
1385,BAMBERA: In this world we have a great and honourable tradition of
1386,tactical withdrawal. 
1387,"ANCELYN: Ah, you wish to run away. Well, there can be but thirty of"
1388,them at the most. 
1389,"BAMBERA: If you don't start running, I'll kill you myself. Now come on!"

1397," DOCTOR: Ace, things may get dangerous, so I want"
1398,you to have this. 
1399,ACE: It looks like a piece of chalk. 
1400,DOCTOR: It is. I got it from the dartboard. But it will protect you
1401,against Morgaine's sorcery. 
1402,ACE: A piece of chalk? 
1403,"DOCTOR: A piece of chalk. At the first sign of anything strange, I want"
1404,"you to draw a chalk circle, and you and Shou Yuing stay inside it along"
1405,with Excalibur. 
1406,"ACE: Right, Professor. Chalk circle. Sure. "
1407,"DOCTOR: And remember, stay inside the circle. Don't leave it until I"
1408,return. 
1409,"ACE: Doctor, you are coming back, aren't you? "
1410,"DOCTOR: Trust me. Ready, Brigadier? "
1411,BRIGADIER: Ready. 
1412,ACE: Naught to sixty in twenty minutes. 
1413,SHOU: As fast as that? 
1414,"DOCTOR: Appearances can be deceiving, Ace. "
1415,(The Doctor puts a round device on the steering wheel and turns a lever
1416,a lot. Then he starts the engine.) 
1417,"DOCTOR: And remember, look after Excalibur and stay in the circle. "
1418,"(Bessie zooms off, spitting gravel and leaving literally burning rubber"
1419,behind.)

1428,SHOU: What are they? 
1429,ACE: Silver bullets. 
1430,SHOU: Really? 
1431,(Thunder crashes overhead.) 
1432,SHOU: What did the Doctor say? At the first sign of something strange 
1433,ACE: Looks like Colonel Blimp has a fancy taste in
1434,hardware. 
1435,"SHOU: You don't like him much, do you? "
1436,"ACE: I like to be treated as a person, not A latest one. Anyway, I"
1437,don't trust him to guard the Professor's back. That's my job. 
1438,(More thunder.) 
1439,SHOU: Do you think that counts as strange? 
1440,ACE: Where's the chalk? 
1441, [Castle] 
1442," MORGAINE: With fire, I shall summon you. With"
1443,silver I shall bind you.

1447, (Ace finishes drawing a chalk circle on the
1448,"flagstones. Shou, the scabbard, and Excalibur are in it with her.) "
1449,ACE: Do you think we should sprinkle holy water or something? 
1450,SHOU: I don't know. It's not my mythology. 
1451,(The room goes dark except for a light straight down on the circle.) 
1452,SHOU: Ace? 
1453,ACE: Yeah? 
1454,SHOU: What's happening? 
1455, [Overlooking the dig site] 
1456, (A battle is raging in the trenches when the
1457,Doctor stops Bessie. The Brigadier is using the field telephone.) 
1458,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, I've just received the most peculiar from the hotel."
1459,
1460,DOCTOR: Does it say anything about Ace and Shou Yuing? 
1461,"BRIGADIER: No. All it said was, night has fallen here. "
1462,"DOCTOR: I'll deal with that later. First, I've got to put an end to"
1463,this bloodshed. 
1464,"BRIGADIER: Oh, how, Doctor? Stand in the middle and shout stop? "
1465,DOCTOR: Good idea. 
1466, [Gore Crow Hotel] 
1467,  ACE: Stupid. 
1468,SHOU: What did you say? 
1469,ACE: What? 
1470,SHOU: Nothing. 
1471, ACE: This is stupid. 
1472,SHOU: What did you call me? 
1473,"ACE: I said, this is stupid. You deaf or something? "
1474,SHOU: No you didn't. I heard you. You called me stupid. 
1475,ACE: I'm not a freak. 
1476,SHOU: What? 
1477,"ACE: I said, I'm not a freak. I'm Ace. Are you dumb or what? "
1478,SHOU: I'm not stupid. 
1479,(The two girls square up to each other.) 
1480,ACE: Then why do you keep saying stupid things? 
1481,"SHOU: That's good, coming from a reject like you. "
1482,"ACE: Listen here, toad-face. Just you shut your mouth or I'll knock"
1483,your teeth in! 
1484,(Shou backs up to the edge of the circle.) 
1485,SHOU: I bet nobody likes you. 
1486,ACE: Shut up. 
1487,"SHOU: First chance he got, the Doctor went off without you. "
1488,ACE: Shut up! Shut up! 
1489,SHOU: I bet even your parents hated your guts! 
1490,(Now Ace backs up to the edge of the circle.) 
1491,"ACE: Shut up, you yellow, slant-eyed "
1492,(Then realises she is about to leave the circle. They hug each other.) 
1493,ACE: Someone's playing games with our minds. 
1494, [Castle] 
1495," MORGAINE: Oh, they breed their children strong on"
1496,this world. Huh. No matter. There shall be an end to these games. 
1497, [Dig site] 
1498," (The fighting is nearly even, but UNIT are taking"
1499,the worst of it. Bambera pushes Ancelyn out of the line of fire.)

1501,"ANCELYN: Mordred! Face me, Mordred! Mordred! "
1502,(Mordred is staying out of the fighting.) 
1503,ANCELYN: Is your army not enough to give you courage? 
1504,"MORDRED: Courage? Ha, to face you, Ancelyn, who fled the field at"
1505,"Camlan? Ancelyn the Craven, I call you. "
1506,ANCELYN: What care I for the words of a half-man who cowers from a
1507,woman's wrath. 
1508,(Mordred and Ancelyn yell and rush each other. The Doctor runs between
1509,them.) 
1510,DOCTOR: Stop! I command it! There will be no battle here! 
1511,"MORDRED: This is no battle. Tis but a ruse, a diversion. My mother hath"
1512,"summoned the Destroyer, the Lord of Darkness, Eater of Worlds. Look to"
1513,"your children, Merlin, for soon they shall be no more. "
1514,"DOCTOR: Ace, what have I done? "
1515, [Gore Crow Hotel] 
1516, (Morgaine is standing just outside the circle.) 
1517,MORGAINE: I am Morgaine of the Fey. I am power beyond your imagining.
1518,Surrender to me what is mine by right of conquest. Give me Excalibur. 
1519,ACE: Never! 
1520,MORGAINE: Then you shall be given over to the Destroyer. 
1521,"(The blue-faced, horned beast appears.) "
1522,MORGAINE: And become his handmaidens in hell. Bwahahahaha! 
1523, Part Four
1524,
1525, [Dig site] 
1526, DOCTOR: Tell Morgaine to call off the Destroyer. 
1527,MORDRED: Surrender to our justice and the children will live. 
1528,DOCTOR: Your justice? Tell her to call it off or I will decapitate you.
1529,

1531,his throat.) 
1532, [Gore Crow Hotel] 
1533, (Morgaine walks around the outside of the circle
1534,with her crystal ball.) 
1535,MORGAINE: Now we shall see what is happening. Oh. He must care for you
1536,very much to threaten my son so. Fear not. It is a deception. 
1537, [Dig site] 
1538, MORGAINE : He is bluffing. 
1539,"MORDRED: We know you of old, Merlin. You will not kill. "
1540,DOCTOR: I wouldn't count on it. 
1541,"MORDRED: Come then, look me in the eye. End my life. "
1542,(The Doctor removes the sword and Mordred laughs.) 
1543,"MORDRED: It is a weakness, this lack of spirit. "
1544,(The Brigadier puts his revolver to Mordred's head.) 
1545,BRIGADIER: Try me. 
1546,(Mordred's smile fades.)

1553,MORDRED: Yes. 
1554,"BRIGADIER: Listen to me, Morgaine. Leave my world or your son dies. "
1555,MORDRED: Deathless Morgaine.

1568,ACE: No!

1576,"BAMBERA: That's what we're paid for, so let's do it with some style! "
1577,(The battle is rejoined. Bambera picks up a fallen knight's sword and
1578,has a go herself.) 
1579,MORDRED: My mother will destroy you. 
1580,"BRIGADIER: Just between you and me, Mordred, I'm getting a little tired"
1581,of hearing about your mother. Get in. 
1582,(The Brigadier pushes Mordred into the back of Bessie and climbs in

1587,crystal ball.) 
1588,MORGAINE: Your friends will soon be dead.

1590,"MORGAINE: Now, give me Excalibur. "
1591,"ACE: If you're so powerful, why don't you come and get it? "
1592,MORGAINE: An excellent suggestion. 
1593,(But she cannot push her hands past the circle.) 
1594,MORGAINE: The sword is protecting you. 
1595,ACE: The Doctor was right. You can't touch us while we're in the
1596,circle. Not while we've got the paper knife. 
1597,MORGAINE: This is true. I cannot break such an enchantment. 
1598,DESTROYER: But I can. 
1599,"ACE: If you're so bad, why haven't you done anything yet? "
1600,DESTROYER: First I must be freed. This mortal has me chained. 
1601,MORGAINE: With silver. 
1602,DESTROYER: It burns. 
1603,MORGAINE: Good. 
1604,DESTROYER: She fears me. 
1605,MORGAINE: I fear nothing. 
1606,"DESTROYER: Then free me, and let me claim this world. "
1607,MORGAINE: Perhaps. 
1608,ACE: What does he want the world for? 
1609,"DESTROYER: Why, to devour it. What else? "

1616,"(The Doctor is knocked off his feet, and Mordred and the Brigadier are"
1617,thrown out of Bessie.) 
1618,DOCTOR: Morgaine! If they're dead

1626,"ACE: We're here, Professor. "
1627,(The Doctor helps them get a easy chair off their backs.) 
1628,DOCTOR: What happened? 
1629,SHOU: The hotel fell on us. 
1630,"ACE: There was this woman with a pet demon, and I seem to remember a"
1631,chalk circle that was supposed to protect us from harm. 
1632,"DOCTOR: Yes, I get the idea, Ace. Where's Excalibur? "
1633,"SHOU: Er, the woman seemed to want it very badly. "
1634,"ACE: Very, very badly. "
1635,SHOU: So we gave it to her. 
1636,DOCTOR: Good. 
1637,"ACE: But it's not our fault. I mean, if I'd had some Nitro, then maybe"
1638,"I could. What do you mean, good? "
1639,DOCTOR: Exotic alien swords are easy to come by. Aces are rare. 
1640,BRIGADIER: Doctor? What do you make of this? 
1641,(A shimmering curtain in the room.) 
1642,DOCTOR: I don't know. Which way did Morgaine leave? 
1643,ACE: A flash of light and gone. 
1644,DOCTOR: I wonder. 
1645,(He pushes a table leg into the curtain.)  
1646, [Castle]

1661,"DOCTOR: Well, first we go through this. Brigadier, I'll go first. Ace "
1662,ACE: Stay here. 
1663,"DOCTOR: Correct. And you. Now, high drama is very similar to comedy."
1664,It's all a matter of 
1665,(The Doctor hands the scabbard to Ace and pirouettes his way into the
1666,vortex. The Brigadier copies him.) 
1667,DOCTOR: Timing. 
1668,(Mordred hides from patrolling soldiers then makes his way to the
1669,castle.) 
1670,CHOU: They're going to be killed. You saw the Destroyer. 
1671,ACE: Morgaine could control the Destroyer. She had it chained up with
1672,silver chains. Get it? 
1673,SHOU: The silver bullets! 
1674,ACE: Keep an eye on the vortex. 
1675,(Ace holds the scabbard and searches in the rubble.) 
1676,SHOU: It's fading. 
1677,ACE: Got them! 
1678,"SHOU: It's going. What're you going to do, throw them through? "
1679,ACE: Do me a favour. Geronimo!

1682," DESTROYER: You would do well to release me,"
1683,Morgaine. 
1684,MORGAINE: Release you? 
1685,DESTROYER: Merlin is mighty and cunning. I cannot destroy him while I
1686,am chained. 
1687,"MORGAINE: What matter? I have Excalibur. Without it, Arthur sleeps"
1688,forever. Merlin cannot find me ere I leave. See! The gateway home is
1689,almost complete. 
1690,DESTROYER: He comes even as we speak. 
1691,MORGAINE: How? He cannot come through the vortex. You have allowed him
1692,access. Why? 
1693,DESTROYER: So that you would be forced to release me. 
1694,(The Doctor and the Brigadier arrive.) 
1695,DOCTOR: Morgaine. 
1696,(The Brigadier fires all his rounds into the Destroyer. They have no
1697,effect.) 
1698,DOCTOR: Brigadier. 
1699,"BRIGADIER: Well, nothing ventured, Doctor. "
1700,DESTROYER: Nothing gained. 
1701,(The Destroyer lassoes the Brigadier with green energy and throws him
1702,"through the planks nailed across the windows, out onto the grass.) "
1703,DOCTOR: That was uncalled for. 
1704,"(The Doctor makes for Excalibur, but Morgaine grabs it first.) "
1705,"MORGAINE: Your move, Merlin. "
1706,(They circle each other.) 
1707,"DOCTOR: You haven't won the game yet, Morgaine. "
1708,"MORGAINE: I could always defeat you at chess, Merlin. "
1709,DOCTOR: Who said anything about playing chess? I'm playing poker. 
1710,(Ace twirls in and knocks Morgaine down before falling over herself.
1711,The Doctor catches Excalibur.) 
1712,DOCTOR: And I have an Ace up my sleeve. 
1713,ACE: Very funny. 
1714,MORGAINE: Destroy him. 
1715,DESTROYER: Release me. 
1716,"DOCTOR: What is it to be, Morgaine? Who do you fear more? "
1717,"MORGAINE: This is no idle threat, Merlin. Give me Excalibur or I will"
1718,loose the Destroyer upon the world. 
1719,DOCTOR: Don't be a fool. 
1720,"(Morgaine makes a gesture, and the Destroyer pulls the chain links"
1721,"apart, then rips off the silver breast plate.) "
1722,"ACE: Nice work, Doctor. "
1723,DOCTOR: But I thought she was bluffing.

1737,have lost.

1740,MORGAINE: Mordred? 
1741,DOCTOR: About time.

1743,glowing spheres.)

1745,"MORDRED: In spite of thee, false parent. Witch! "
1746,MORGAINE: I thought you dead. 
1747,MORDRED: Thought? Or wished it so. 
1748,"MORGAINE: Mordred, no. That was not the way of it. No. "
1749,(Morgaine and Mordred vanish through circle of light.) 
1750,"ACE: Doctor, can I have a word? "
1751,BRIGADIER: Doctor? 
1752,"DOCTOR: Brigadier, you're going the wrong way. Ace! "
1753,"(The Doctor sends the Brigadier back outside then grabs Ace, who is"
1754,picking up the box of silver bullets and follows him.)

1756, [Outside the castle] 
1757, DESTROYER: Devour. 
1758, BRIGADIER: What was that? 
1759,"DOCTOR: That, Brigadier, was the beginning of the end of the world. "
1760,"BRIGADIER: Same as ever, eh, Doctor? "
1761, [Castle] 
1762, DESTROYER: I hunger. 
1763, [Outside the castle] 
1764, DOCTOR: It's no good. It's not good at all. 
1765,BRIGADIER: I can have an air strike here in minutes. 
1766,"DOCTOR: It's no good, Brigadier. Conventional weapons won't harm it. "
1767,"BRIGADIER: No, I didn't think so. "
1768,"DOCTOR: Ace, give me the silver bullets. "
1769,ACE: How did you know? 
1770,DOCTOR: Silver bullets'll do the trick. 
1771,ACE: How did you know I had them? 
1772,"DOCTOR: It's all a matter of timing, Ace. Give me your gun. "
1773,(The Brigadier hands over his revolver.) 
1774,"BRIGADIER: What, those will stop the Destroyer? What, you just shoot"
1775,the bullets into it? 
1776,(The Doctor loads the revolver.) 
1777,"DOCTOR: Simple, isn't it? Just like most killings. "
1778,"BRIGADIER: Good lord, is that a spaceship? "
1779,"(Ace and The Doctor turn and looks up, and the Brigadier chops the"
1780,"Doctor across the throat, knocking him out. He grabs back his the"
1781,revolver.) 
1782,ACE: You scumbag! 
1783,"BRIGADIER: Sorry, Doctor, but I think I'm rather more expendable than"
1784,you are. 
1785, [Castle] 
1786, DESTROYER: This world shall be mine. And then
1787,"another, and another. "
1788,(Green explosions come out of the castle. The Brigadier walks in.) 
1789,"DESTROYER: Ah, little man. What do you want of me? "
1790,BRIGADIER: Get off my world.

1792, (The Doctor wakes to the sound of an explosion.) 
1793,DOCTOR: We've got to stop him. 
1794, [Castle] 
1795, DESTROYER: Pitiful. Can this world do no better
1796,than you as their champion? 
1797,BRIGADIER: Probably. I just do the best I can. 
1798,(The Brigadier fires the silver rounds into the Destroyer's exposed
1799,chest and the creature explodes.) 
1800, [Outside the castle] 
1801, (Ace and the Doctor see the building reduced to
1802,ruins.) 
1803,ACE: No chance. He's had it. 
1804, [Dig site] 
1805," BAMBERA: Sergeant, where's that coffee? Sergeant! "
1806,(Mordred comes round the back of a truck and puts his sword to
1807,Bambera's throat.) 
1808,MORDRED: The battle's not over yet. 
1809, [Outside the castle] 
1810, (The Doctor finds the Brigadier amidst the burning
1811,ruin and cradles him in his arms.) 
1812,"DOCTOR: You stupid, stubborn, pig-headed numbskull. You were supposed"
1813,"to die in bed. I could have handled it, done your job. "
1814,"BRIGADIER: Nonsense, Doctor. "
1815,DOCTOR: You're supposed to be dead. 
1816,"BRIGADIER: Oh, really, Doctor. You don't think I'd be so stupid as to"
1817,"stay inside, do you? "
1818,DOCTOR: Well 
1819,"BRIGADIER: Really, Doctor, have a little faith. Ace? "
1820,"ACE: Yes, Brigadier. "
1821,BRIGADIER: I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. He's all yours
1822,from now on. I'm going home to Doris. 
1823,DOCTOR: Doris? 
1824,"BRIGADIER: Yes, my wife. "
1825,"DOCTOR: Ha, ha, ha. So she caught you in the end. "
1826,BRIGADIER: Yeah. 
1827,"ACE: Oi, shouldn't we be getting back? "
1828,"BRIGADIER: Yes, Ace is right. I suspect there's some clearing up to be"
1829,done. 
1830,"DOCTOR: Yes, just a small nuclear missile bogged down in a nature"
1831,reserve. 
1832, [UNIT Mobile Command post] 
1833," (Prelaunch sequence complete, says the computer"
1834,screen. Enter failsafe release code. Mordred has Bambera at
1835,swordpoint.) 
1836,BAMBERA: It's a nuclear missile. The blast will kill you as well. 
1837,"MORGAINE: We shall be long gone ere that happens. Now tell me, what is"
1838,the secret incantation? 
1839,BAMBERA: I don't know what you're talking about. 
1840,MORGAINE: The magic words. The failsafe release code. 
1841,BAMBERA: I've no idea. 
1842,"MORGAINE: Oh, I doubt that. What is the code? "
1843,(Morgaine stares into Bambera's eyes.) 
1844, [Spacecraft] 
1845," DOCTOR: Ancelyn, replace Excalibur and Arthur will"
1846,arise. 
1847,ANCELYN: I think the honour belongs to the Brigadier. 
1848,"BRIGADIER: Oh, the Doctor should do it. "
1849,"ANCELYN: No, my lord. You were the victor. "
1850,ACE: Give me that. 
1851,"DOCTOR: Ace, have you no sense of occasion? "
1852,ACE: No. 
1853,"(So the person that pulled it out puts it back in, and the spacecraft"
1854,powers up.) 
1855,"ANCELYN: Listen, she is alive. "
1856,ACE: Which is more than can be said for Arthur the freeze-dried. 
1857,DOCTOR: This is very odd. 
1858,"ACE: Well, you put him there. "
1859,DOCTOR: I will put him there. 
1860,"ACE: What's wrong, Doctor? "
1861,"(The Doctor removes Arthur's helm, and sand pours out. There is also a"
1862,note.) 
1863,ANCELYN: Where is the King? 
1864,"ACE: Doctor, this is for you. "
1865,DOCTOR: What does it say? 
1866,ACE: Dear Doctor. King died in final battle. Everything else
1867,propaganda. 
1868,DOCTOR: Who signed it? 
1869,ACE: The Doctor. 
1870,"DOCTOR: Ah well, that sorts that out. "
1871,"ACE: PS, Morgaine has just seized control of the nuclear missile. "
1872,"DOCTOR: Tut. I could have given myself more warning. Brigadier, you and"
1873,Ace see to this ship. 
1874,"BRIGADIER: Explosives, Doctor. "
1875,ACE: Now you're talking. 
1876,"DOCTOR: Yes, we'll give Arthur a warrior's burial. "
1877, [UNIT Mobile Command post] 
1878, (Mordred lays Bambera's body on the ground by the
1879,"Mobile Command post, then Ancelyn charges in. The two rivals fight,"
1880,parting briefly as the Doctor walks between them and goes inside. 
1881,The countdown passes 60.) 
1882,"MORGAINE: Too late, Merlin. "
1883,DOCTOR: Is it? Not while there's an abort button. 
1884,(Morgaine and the Doctor struggle.) 
1885,"DOCTOR: If this missile explodes, millions will die, you will die. "
1886,MORGAINE: I shall die with honour. 
1887,"(45, 44) "
1888,"DOCTOR: All over the world, fools are poised ready to let death fly. A"
1889,spark could turn into an inferno. 
1890,MORGAINE: What do I care? This is war. 
1891,"DOCTOR: Is it? Death falling from the sky, blind, random, anywhere,"
1892,"anytime. No one is safe, no one is innocent?  Machines of"
1893,"death, Morgaine, are screaming from above, of light brighter than the"
1894,"sun. Not a war between armies nor a war between nations, but just"
1895,"death, death gone mad. The child looks up in the sky, his eyes turn to"
1896,"cinders. No more tears, only ashes. Is this honour? Is this war? Are"
1897,these the weapons you would use? Tell me! 
1898,MORGAINE: No. 
1899,"DOCTOR: Then put a stop to it, Morgaine. End the madness. "
1900,"(4, 3, 2. Morgaine presses the red abort button at 1.) "
1901,MORGAINE: Then tell Arthur to face me with honour in single combat. Tell
1902,"him to show himself. It's time he ceased hiding behind your coat tails,"
1903,Merlin. 
1904, [Dig site] 
1905, (The spacecraft explodes in the lake. Ace leaps up
1906,and down.) 
1907,ACE: And you said two kilos wouldn't be enough. 
1908,"BRIGADIER: Hey, mind you don't get your feet wet."
1909,
1910, [UNIT Mobile Command post] 
1911, DOCTOR: Arthur is dead. 
1912,MORGAINE: No. 
1913,"DOCTOR: He's dead, Morgaine. "
1914,"MORGAINE: Merlin, prince of deceit. Another trick. "
1915,DOCTOR: No. 
1916,MORGAINE: I don't believe you. 
1917,DOCTOR: Don't you? 
1918,MORGAINE: It can't be. 
1919,DOCTOR: He died over a thousand years ago. 
1920,"MORGAINE: Arthur, who burned like star fire. "
1921,DOCTOR: Gone. 
1922,MORGAINE: And was as beautiful. Where does he lie? I would look at him
1923,one final time. 
1924,DOCTOR: He's gone to dust. 
1925,MORGAINE: Then I shall not even have that comfort. I shall never see
1926,him again. Arthur. We were together in the woods of Celadon. The air
1927,was like honey. 
1928,"DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Morgaine. It's over. "
1929,(The Doctor removes the key from the firing controls and puts it in his
1930,breast pocket.) 
1931, [Dig site] 
1932, (Mordred finally bests Ancelyn.) 
1933,"ANCELYN: I do not fear death, Mordred. You have slain my beloved. There"
1934,is no life without her. 
1935,MORDRED: So be it. Tis time! 
1936,(The Doctor stops Mordred swinging his sword. He forces him to his
1937,knees and puts his fingers on Mordred's forehead.) 
1938,DOCTOR: Time and Time Lords wait for no man. 
1939,"(Mordred falls unconscious. Bambera gets up, and so does Ancelyn.) "
1940,"DOCTOR: Ah, Brigadier. Before Mordred recovers, lock him up. And while"
1941,"you're at it, lock up his mother. "
1942, [Lethbridge-Stewart's garden] 
1943," DOCTOR: Peaceful, isn't it? "
1944,"ANCELYN: The silence after a battle, Doctor. "
1945,"BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, I'm not being a very good host. Are you all right"
1946,out here? 
1947,"DOCTOR: Oh, just admiring the garden. "
1948,"BRIGADIER: I don't suppose you've seen Doris, have you? "
1949,DORIS: Bye! 
1950,(The Brigadier goes to her.) 
1951,DOCTOR: I think the battle may be about to begin. 
1952,"BRIGADIER: You going somewhere, dear? "
1953,DORIS: Out. 
1954,BRIGADIER: Out? 
1955,"DORIS: Out, with the girls. "
1956, [Lethbridge-Stewart's driveway]
1957,
1958, (Ace is polishing Bessie's bonnet.) 
1959,DOCTOR: I thought you said this was a piece of antiquated junk? 
1960,"ACE: Did I say that, Professor? "
1961,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1962,SHOU: We'll try not to break too many speed records. 
1963,BAMBERA: Or traffic laws. 
1964,"DORIS: Hey, what's that? "
1965,"ACE: Do you want to drive, Doris? "
1966,"DORIS: Oh, no. Er, I'll drive on the way back, okay? "
1967,DOCTOR: Allow me. 
1968,(The Doctor hands Doris into the passenger seat.) 
1969,"DORIS: Thank you, Doctor. Whee! "
1970,"BRIGADIER: Er, exactly how far are you intending to go, Doris? "
1971,"DORIS: Well, I don't know, but there's lots of work to be done in the"
1972,garden. Roll the grass. 
1973,BRIGADIER: What about supper? 
1974,"DORIS: Oh, that's a good idea. Have something really delicious ready"
1975,"for us when we get home, okay? "
1976,(Ace drives Bessie away with a honk of the horn.) 
1977,"DORIS: Oh, wicked! "
1978,"ANCELYN: Ah, are they not magnificent? "
1979,"BRIGADIER: Yeah. Are you any good with a lawn mower, Ancelyn? "
1980,DOCTOR: I'll cook supper.
