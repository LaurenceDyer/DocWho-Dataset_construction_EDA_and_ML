23,"Down in the streets, lots of banners with Chinese symbols on them. The"
24,Doctor hands Donna a mug of foaming drink.) 
25,"DOCTOR: Oh, ho, ho. "
26,DONNA: I'd rather have a water. 
27,"DOCTOR: You are going to love it. One, two, three! "
28,DONNA: Lovely! 
29,(They carry on through the market.) 
30,SALESWOMAN: You want to buy shukina? Or peshmoni? Most beautiful
31,peshmoni in all of Shan Shen? 
32,"DONNA: Er, no thanks. "
33,(The Doctor is haggling with another stallholder so Donna explores on
34,her own. A young woman in a black and gold robe calls to her.) 
35,"FORTUNE TELLER: Tell your fortune, lady. The future predicted. Your"
36,life foretold. 
37,"DONNA: Oh, no thanks. "
38,FORTUNE TELLER: Don't you want to know if you're going to be happy? 
39,"DONNA: I'm happy right now, thanks. "
40,FORTUNE TELLER: You got red hair. The reading's free for red hair.

45,(The young woman looks at Donna's palms.) 
46,"FORTUNE TELLER: Oh, you fascinating. No, but you good. I can see a man."
47,The most remarkable man. How did you meet him? 
48,DONNA: You're supposed to tell me. 
49,FORTUNE TELLER: I see the future. Tell me the past. When did your lives
50,cross? 
51,DONNA: It's sort of complicated. I ended up in a spaceship on my
52,wedding day. Long story. 
53,FORTUNE TELLER: But what led you to that meeting? 
54,"DONNA: All sorts of things. But my job, I suppose. It was on Earth,"
55,"this planet called Earth, miles away. But I had this job as a temp. I"
56,was a secretary at a place called HC Clements. 
57,(Donna has an intense flashback. It makes her sway.) 
58,DONNA: Oh. Sorry. 
59,FORTUNE TELLER: It's the incense. Just breathe deep. This job of yours.
60,What choices led you there? 
61,"DONNA: There was a choice, six months before, because the Agency"
62,offered me this contract with HC Clements 
63,[Car]
64,
65,DONNA : But there was this other job. My mum
66,knew this man 
67,"SYLVIA: Jival, he's called. Jival Chowdry? He runs that little"
68,photocopy business and he needs a secretary. 
69,DONNA: I've got a job. 
70,"SYLVIA: As a temp. This is permanent, it's twenty thousand a year,"
71,Donna. 
72,"DONNA: HC Clements is in the City. It's nice, it's posh, so stop it."

75,
76,FORTUNE TELLER: Your life could have gone one way
77,or the other. What made you decide? 
78,DONNA: I just did.

83,
84,"(Donna is at a junction, waiting to turn onto the"
85,main road.) 
86,SYLVIA: It won't take long. Just turn right. We'll pop in and see
87,"Mister Chowdry, so Suzette can introduce you. "
88,"DONNA: I'm going left. If you don't like it, get out and walk. "
89,"SYLVIA: If you turn right, you'll have a career, not just filling in. "
90,DONNA: You think I'm so useless. 
91,"SYLVIA: Oh, I know why you want a job at HC Clements, lady. Because you"
92,think you'll meet a man with lots of money and your whole life will
93,"change. Well let me tell you, sweetheart. City executives don't need"
94,"temps, except for practice. "
95,"DONNA: Yeah. Well, they haven't met me. "
96,[Fortune teller's tent]
97,
98,FORTUNE TELLER: You turned left. But what if you
99,turned right? What then? 
100,DONNA: Let go of my hands. 
101,FORTUNE TELLER: What if it changes? What if you go right? What if you
102,could still go right? 
103,DONNA: Stop it. 
104,(Something jumps onto Donna's back.) 
105,"DONNA: What's that? What's on my back? What is it? What, what's on my"
106,back? 
107,"FORTUNE TELLER: Make the choice again, Donna Noble, and change your"
108,mind. Turn right. 
109,(A hooked claw reaches to Donna's shoulder.)

111,FORTUNE TELLER: Turn right. Turn right. Turn right!

113,[Car]
114,
115,"SYLVIA: Well, let me tell you, sweetheart. City"
116,"executives don't need temps, except for practice. "
117,DONNA: Yeah. Suppose you're right. 
118,"FORTUNE TELLER : Turn right, and never meet that man. Turn right,"
119,and change the world.

127,Feed at the trough. 
128,VEENA: Mooky says let's go to the Boardwalk. It's two for the price of
129,one. 
130,DONNA: Christmas Eve? It'll be heaving. 
131,"MOOKY: Well, exactly, Get in and grab them. "
132,"VEENA: Hey, that's the second round of drinks you've bought. It was my"
133,turn.

140,(A blonde woman is staring at Donna.) 
141,DONNA: What's wrong? What is it? 
142,ALICE: Sorry? 
143,DONNA: Did someone spill a drink on me? 
144,ALICE: Why? 
145,DONNA: Why do you keep looking at my shoulder? What's wrong? 
146,ALICE: I don't know. 
147,"DONNA: Oh, don't tell me you're getting all spooky again. It was bad"
148,enough when you saw the ghost of Earl Mountbatten at the boat show.
149,What are you looking at? What is it? 
150,"ALICE: It's like, it's like there's something I can't see. "
151,(A man bursts in.) 
152,"MAN: Come on, shut up, all of you. Come and see. Just look at the sky!"
153,It's a star! It's a Christmas star!

159,"VEENA: Ken Livingstone, that's what! Spending our money on decorations!"
160,"I mean, how much did that cost? "
161,(The Racnoss web ship is sailing across the sky.) 
162,MOOKY: Don't be so stupid. It's flying! It's really flying! 
163,(The people run around the corner to watch it.) 
164,DONNA: That's not a star. That's a web. It's heading east. Middle of
165,the City. 
166,(Energy lances from the web star and everyone starts screaming and
167,"running, except Donna and Alice.) "
168,"DONNA: Alice! There's a great big web star thing shooting at people,"
169,and you're looking at me? 
170,ALICE: There is something on your back. 
171,(Alice runs away. Donna walks forward.) 
172,"VEENA: Donna? Donna, where are you going? You'll get yourself killed!"
173,Donna!

176,SOLDIER: Fire! 
177,(Tanks shoot at the web star. Donna arrives at a barricade.) 
178,"SOLDIER: Everyone, stay back. The Thames has been closed. Return to"
179,"your homes. Keep away from the river, and that's an order. "
180,(Donna quietly sneaks around the back to the Army trucks.) 
181,OFFICER : Trap One to Greyhound Fifteen. What is your report? Over.
182,
183,"HARRIS: From the evidence, I'd say he managed to stop the creature."

187,"HARRIS: We found a body, sir. Over. "
188,(Ambulance personnel bring a body on a stretcher.) 
189,OFFICER : Is it him? Over. 
190,HARRIS: I think so. He just didn't make it out in time. 
191,"(As the stretcher is lifted into the ambulance, an arm drops from under"
192,the blanket and drops a sonic screwdriver to the ground.) 
193,HARRIS: The Doctor is dead. Must have happened too fast for him to
194,regenerate. Escort the ambulance back to UNIT base. 
195,(Donna walks on. A blonde woman runs towards her. She speaks as if her
196,top lip is glued to her teeth.) 
197,"ROSE: What happened? What did they find? I'm sorry, did they find"
198,someone? 
199,"DONNA: I don't know. A bloke called the Doctor, or something. "
200,"ROSE: Well, where is he? "
201,"DONNA: They took him away. He's dead. I'm sorry, did you know him? I"
202,"mean, they didn't say his name. Could be any doctor. "
203,ROSE: I came so far. 
204,"DONNA: It, it could be anyone. "
205,ROSE: What's your name? 
206,DONNA: Donna. And you? 
207,"ROSE: Oh, I was just passing by. I shouldn't even be here. This is"
208,"wrong. It's wrong. This is so wrong. Sorry, what was it? Donna what? "
209,DONNA: Why do you keep looking at my back? 
210,ROSE: I'm not. 
211,"DONNA: Yes, you are. You keep looking behind me. You're doing it now."
212,What is it? What's there? Did someone put something on my back?

215,[General office]
216,
217,DONNA: You can't sack me. I'm your personal
218,assistant! 
219,CHOWDRY: You don't have to make a scene. Just come downstairs and we
220,can have a little talk. 
221,"DONNA: Oh, I'll make a scene, all right, right in front of a tribunal."
222,And the first thing I'm
223,going to say is wandering hands! 
224,"CHOWDRY: Now, come on, Donna. You know what it's been like for the past"
225,"few months, ever since that Christmas thing. Half my contracts were on"
226,"the other side of the river and the Thames is still closed off. Look, I"
227,can't deliver. I'm losing a fortune. 
228,"DONNA: Well, sack one of this lot. Sack Cliff. He just sits there."
229,"Don't know what he does all day. Sorry, Cliff. Actually, I'm not sorry."
230,What do you do all day? 
231,(Boom! the building shakes.) 
232,CHOWDRY: What the hell? Like an earthquake. 
233,(A black cloud is gathering in the sky.) 
234,CHOWDRY: That's weird. Funny sort of clouds. 
235,DONNA: Who typed this? I'm your PA. Did you get somebody else to type
236,this? Beatrice? 
237,"NEWS 24 [on TV]: It sounds impossible, but the entire hospital has"
238,"vanished. The Royal Hope no longer exists. It's not been destroyed,"
239,there's no wreckage. It's simply gone. Reports from bystanders say that

241,(Donna is clearing her desk.) 
242,"DONNA: Hole punch. Having that. Stapler, mine. Toy cactus. You can have"
243,"that, Beatrice. Catch. Cliff, I'd leave you the mouse mat, but I'm"
244,worried you'd cut yourself. 
245,"CHOWDRY: All right, Donna, have some respect. There's two thousand"
246,"people in that hospital, and it's vanished. "
247,"DONNA: Oh, I'll show you vanishing. Thanks for nothing. Oh, and you"
248,"know when that money went missing from the kitty? Anne-Marie, that's"
249,all I'm saying. Anne-Marie!

261,WILF: Rhinos could be aliens. 
262,DONNA: Shush. 
263,MORGENSTERN: There were hundreds of them. We couldn't breathe. We were
264,running out of air. A colleague of mine gave me the last oxygen tank.
265,Martha. Martha Jones. And she died. 
266,SYLVIA: At least you got a hole punch and a raffle ticket. 
267,"DONNA: Yeah, well, they can keep the raffle. I won't take a penny off"
268,that man. 
269,"WILF: Honestly, you two. There's aliens on the news. They took that"
270,"hospital all the way to the moon, and you're banging on about raffle"
271,tickets. 
272,"DONNA: Don't be daft, Gramps. It wasn't the moon. It couldn't be. "
273,"WILF: Yes, well, I am telling you it is getting worse, these past few"
274,"years. It's like, all of a sudden, they suddenly know all about us, and"
275,"there's keen eyes up there and they're watching us, and they're not"
276,friendly. 
277,SYLVIA: This stapler says Bea. 
278,"DONNA: I can't believe how well you're taking it, me getting sacked."
279,Thought you'd hit the roof. 
280,"SYLVIA: I'm just tired, Donna, what with your father and everything. To"
281,"be honest, I've given up on you. "

315,"DONNA: People in the street. Strangers. I just catch them sometimes,"
316,"staring at me. Like they're looking at something. And then I get home,"

449,"WILF: I don't know, do I? "
450,SYLVIA: Who do we ask? The soldiers? 
451,(The front door opens.) 
452,"ROCCO: Hey, hey. Is a big house. Room for all. Welcome! In you come. "
453,DONNA: I thought this was our house. 
454,"ROCCO: Is many peoples house. Is wonderful. In, in, in."
455,
456,[Number 29]
457,
458,ROCCO: We've been here for eight weeks already. I
459,"had a nice little paper shop in Shepherd's Bush. All gone now. So,"
460,"upstairs, we have Merchandani family. Seven of them. Good family. Good"
461,kids. Except that one. You be careful of him. I's a joking! Where's
462,"that smile, eh? Rocco Colasanto. I'm here with my wife and her sister"
463,and her husband and their kids and their daughter's kids. We've got the
464,"front room. My mother, she's got the back room. She's old. You forgive,"
465,eh?. And this? This is you. This is your palazzo. 
466,[Kitchen]
467,
468,"(The galley kitchen has camp beds on the floor, and"
469,a curtain for a door.) 
470,"SYLVIA: What do you mean, this is us? "
471,ROCCO: You live here. 
472,DONNA: We're living in the kitchen? 
473,"ROCCO: You got camp beds. You got the cooker, you keep warm. You got"
474,"the fridge, you keep cool. Is good, eh? "
475,SYLVIA: What about the bathroom? 
476,ROCCO: Nobody lives in the bathroom. 
477,"SYLVIA: No, I mean, is there a rota? "
478,ROCCO: Is pot-luck! Is fun. I go wake Mamma. She likes new people.
479,Mamma! Is people! Nice people! 
480,(Rocco leaves.) 
481,"WILF: Ah, well. We'll settle in, won't we? Make do? Bit of wartime"
482,"spirit, eh? "
483,"DONNA: Yeah, but there isn't a war. There's no fight. It's just this. "
484,"WILF: Well, America, they'll save us. It was on the news. They're going"
485,to send Great Britain fifty billion quid in financial aid. God bless
486,America.
487,"(Later, at mealtime -) "

489,dead. Sixty million people have dissolved into fat. And the fat is
490,walking. People's fat has come to life and is walking through the
491,streets. And there are spaceships. There are reports of spaceships over
492,every major US city. The fat is flying. It's leaving 
493,WILF: Aliens. 
494,DONNA: Yeah.

498,SYLVIA: Mary McGinty. Do you remember her? 
499,DONNA: Who was she? 
500,SYLVIA: Worked in the newsagent on Sunday. Little woman. Black hair. 
501,DONNA: Never really spoke to her. 
502,SYLVIA: She'll be dead. Every day I think of someone else. All dead. 
503,DONNA: Maybe she went away for Christmas. 
504,SYLVIA: Maybe. 
505,DONNA: I'll go out tomorrow. I'll walk into town. There's got to be
506,"work. Everyone needs secretaries. Soon as I'm earning, we'll get a"
507,"proper place. Just you wait, Mum. "
508,SYLVIA: What if it never gets better? 
509,DONNA: Course it will. 
510,SYLVIA: Even the bees are disappearing. You don't see bumble bees
511,anymore. 
512,DONNA: They'll sort us out. The emergency government. They'll do
513,something. 
514,SYLVIA: What if they don't? 
515,DONNA: Then we'll complain. 
516,SYLVIA: Who's going to listen to us? Refugees. We haven't even got a
517,"vote. We're just no one, Donna. We don't exist. "
518,(There is singing in the front room.)

538,"SOLDIER: It's this ATMOS thing, it won't stop. It's like gas. It's"
539,toxic. 
540,"WILF: Well, switch it off. "
541,SOLDIER: I have done. It's still going. It's all the cars. Every single

543,(The soldier aims his weapon at Donna.) 
544,"ROCCO: Are you crazy, boy? "

550,"SOLDIER: Turn around, now! Show me your back! "
551,(Donna raises her arms and turns around slowly.) 
552,SOLDIER: Sorry. I thought I saw. 
553,WILF: Call yourself a soldier? Pointing guns at innocent women? You're

561,
562,(Around the corner.) 
563,DONNA: Hello. 
564,ROSE: Hi.
565,
566,[Park]
567,
568,"ROSE: It's the ATMOS devices. We're lucky, it's not"
569,"so bad here. Britain hasn't got that much petrol. But all over Europe,"
570,"China, South Africa, they're getting choked by gas. "
571,DONNA: Can't anyone stop it? 
572,"ROSE: Yeah, they're trying right now, this little band of fighters, on"
573,board the Sontaran ship. Any second now. 
574,(The sky burns.) 
575,DONNA: And that was? 
576,"ROSE: That was the Torchwood team. Gwen Cooper, Ianto Jones, they gave"
577,their lives. And Captain Jack Harkness has transported to the Sontaran
578,home world. There's no one left. 
579,DONNA: You're always wearing the same clothes. Why won't you tell me
580,your name? 
581,ROSE: None of this was meant to happen. There was a man. This wonderful
582,"man, and he stopped it. The Titanic, the Adipose, the ATMOS, he stopped"
583,them all from happening. 
584,DONNA: That Doctor? 
585,ROSE: You knew him. 
586,DONNA: Did I? When? 
587,ROSE: I think you dream about him sometimes. It's a man in a suit.
588,"Tall, thin man. Great hair. Some really great hair. "
589,DONNA: Who are you? 
590,"ROSE: I was like you. I used to be you. You've travelled with him,"
591,Donna. You've travelled with the Doctor in a different world. 
592,"DONNA: I never met him, and he's dead. "
593,"ROSE: He died underneath the Thames on Christmas Eve, but you were"
594,"meant to be there. He needed someone to stop him, and that was you. You"
595,made him leave. You saved his life. 
596,"(Donna has a memory of the Racnoss Queen, and water bursting into the"
597,tunnels below the Thames.) 
598,"DONNA [memory]: Doctor, you can stop now. "
599,DONNA: Stop it. I don't know what you're talking about. Leave me alone!
600,
601,"ROSE: Something's coming, Donna. Something worse. "
602,DONNA: The whole world is stinking. How can anything be worse than
603,this? 
604,"ROSE: Trust me. We need the Doctor more than ever. I've, I've been"
605,pulled across from a different universe because every single universe
606,"is in danger. It's coming, Donna. It's coming from across the stars and"
607,nothing can stop it. 
608,DONNA: What is? 
609,ROSE: The darkness. 
610,"DONNA: Well, what do you keep telling me for? What am I supposed to do?"
611,"I'm nothing special. I mean, I'm, I'm not. I'm nothing special. I'm a"
612,temp. I'm not even that. I'm nothing. 
613,"ROSE: Donna Noble, you're the most important woman in the whole of"
614,creation. 
615,"DONNA: Oh, don't. Just don't. I'm tired. I'm so tired. "
616,ROSE: I need you to come with me. 
617,"DONNA: Yeah. Well, blonde hair might work on the men, but you ain't"
618,"shifting me, lady. "
619,ROSE: That's more like it. 
620,DONNA: I've got plenty more. 
621,"ROSE: Then you'll come with me, only when you want to. "
622,"DONNA: You'll have a long wait, then. "
623,"ROSE: Not really. Just three weeks. Tell me, does your grandfather"
624,still own that telescope? 
625,DONNA: He never lets go of it. 
626,ROSE: Three weeks time. But you've got to be certain. Because when you
627,"come with me, Donna, sorry, so sorry, but you're"
628,going to die. 
629,(Rose fades away.)

634,All flame-haired and firey. 
635,"DONNA: Oh, but why do you have to go? "
636,"ROCCO: It's the new law. England for the English, et cetera. They can't"
637,send us home. The oceans are closed! They build labour camps. 
638,"DONNA: I know, but labour doing what? There aren't any jobs. "
639,"ROCCO: Sewing, digging. Is good. Now, stop it before I kiss you too"
640,much. 
641,(Rocco kisses Donna on both cheeks.) 
642,ROCCO: Wilfred. My capitano. 
643,"(Rocco salutes Wilf, who returns the honour. Rocco joins his family on"
644,the back in the army truck.) 
645,"DONNA: It'll be quiet with him gone. Still, we'll have more room. "
646,WILF: Labour camps. That's what they called them last time. 
647,DONNA: What do you mean? 
648,WILF: It's happening again. 
649,"DONNA: What is? Excuse me? Excuse me, where are you taking them? Where"
650,"are you going? Rocco, where are you going? Where are you going? Where"
651,are you going? 
652,[Number 29]
653,
654,DONNA: I asked about jobs with the army. They said
655,I wasn't qualified. You were right. You said I should have worked
656,harder at school. I suppose I've always been a disappointment. 
657,SYLVIA: Yeah.

663,"WILF: You know, we'd get a bit of cash if we sold this thing. "
664,"DONNA: Don't you dare. I always imagined, your old age, I'd have put a"
665,bit of money by. Make you comfy. Never did. I'm just useless. You're
666,"supposed to say, no you're not. "
667,"WILF: Ha, it must be the alignment. "
668,DONNA: What's wrong? 
669,"WILF: Well, I don't know. I mean, it can't be the lens, because I was"
670,looking at Orion. The constellation of Orion. You take a look. And tell
671,"me, what can you see? "
672,DONNA: Where? 
673,"WILF: Well, up there in the sky. "
674,"DONNA: Well, I can't see anything. It's just black. "
675,"WILF: Well, I mean, it's working. The telescope is working. "
676,"DONNA: Well, maybe it's clouds. "
677,WILF: There is no clouds. 
678,"DONNA: Well, there must be. "
679,WILF: There's not! It was there. An entire constellation. Look. Look
680,"there. They're going out. Oh, my God! Donna, look. The stars are going"

698,"ROSE: I've crossed too many different realities. Trust me, the wrong"
699,word in the wrong place can change an entire causal nexus.

727,ROSE: He was a Time Lord. Last of his kind.

729,ROSE: He thought you were brilliant. 
730,DONNA: Don't be stupid. 
731,"ROSE: But you are. It just took the Doctor to show you that, simply by"
732,being with him. He did the same to me. To everyone he touches.

762,"DONNA: Oh, thanks. "
763,"ROSE: It feeds off time, by changing time. By making someone's life"
764,"take a different turn, like er, meetings never made, children never"
765,"born, a life never loved. But with you, it's "
766,DONNA: But I never did anything important. 
767,"ROSE: Yeah, you did. One day that thing made you turn right instead of"
768,left. 
769,DONNA: When was that? 
770,"ROSE: Oh, you wouldn't remember. It was the most ordinary day in the"
771,"world. But by turning right, you never met the Doctor, and the whole"
772,world just changed around you.

774,"ROSE: No, I can't even touch it. It seems to be in a state of flux. "
775,DONNA: What does that mean? 
776,ROSE: I don't know. It's the sort of thing the Doctor would say. 
777,"DONNA: You liar! You told me I was special. But it's not me, it's this"
778,thing. I'm just a host! 
779,"ROSE: No, there's more than that. The readings are strange. It's, it's"
780,like reality's just bending round you. 
781,DONNA: Because of this thing! 
782,"ROSE: No, no! We're getting separate readings from you. And they've"
783,"always been there, since the day you were born. "
784,MAGAMBO: This is not relevant to the mission. 
785,"ROSE: I thought it was just the Doctor we needed, but it's the both of"
786,"you. The Doctor and Donna Noble, together, to stop the stars from going"
787,out.

789,ROSE: Captain. 
790,MAGAMBO: Power down. 
791,(Rose goes to Donna.)

793,ROSE: You're going to travel in time. 
794,(Donna is wearing a jacket with lots of wires all over it.) 
795,ROSE: The Tardis has tracked down the moment of intervention. Monday
796,"the twenty fifth, one minute past ten in the morning. Your car was on"
797,"Little Sutton Street leading to the Ealing Road, but you turned right"
798,heading towards Griffin's Parade. You need to turn left. That's the
799,"most important thing. You've got to go back, turn left. Have you got"
800,"that, Donna? One minute past ten, make yourself turn left, heading for"
801,the Chiswick Highroad. 
802,MAGAMBO: Keep the jacket on at all times. It's insulation against
803,temporal feedback. This will correspond to local time wherever you
804,land. 
805,A scientist puts a high tech watch on Donna's wrist. Captain Magambo
806,holds out a glass of water. 
807,MAGAMBO: This is to combat dehydration. 
808, 
809,(Donna is escorted back to the mirrors.) 
810,ROSE: This is where we leave you. 
811,DONNA: I don't want to see that thing on my back. 
812,"ROSE: No, the mirrors are just incidental. They bounce chronon energy"
813,back into the centre which we control and decide the destination. 
814,DONNA: It's a time machine. 
815,ROSE: It's a time machine. 
816,MAGAMBO: If you could? 
817,(Donna takes her place in the middle.) 
818,MAGAMBO: Powering up. 
819,DONNA: How do you know it's going to work? 
820,"ROSE: Hmm? Oh yeah, we, we don't. We're just, we're just guessing. "
821,"DONNA: Oh, brilliant. "
822,"ROSE: Just remember, when you get to the junction, change the car's"
823,direction by one minute past ten. 
824,DONNA: How do I do that? 
825,ROSE: It's up to you. 
826,"DONNA: Well, I just have to run up to myself and have a good argument. "
827,ROSE: I'd like to see that! 
828,MAGAMBO: Activate lodestone. 
829,ROSE: Good luck. 
830,DONNA: I'm ready. 
831,ROSE: One minute past ten. 
832,"DONNA: Because I understand now. You said I was going to die, but you"
833,mean this whole world is
834,"going to blink out of existence. But that's not dying, because a better"
835,world takes its place. The Doctor's world. And I'm still alive. That's
836,"right, isn't it? I don't die. If I change things, I don't die. That's"
837,"that's right, isn't it? "
838,ROSE: I'm sorry. 
839,DONNA: But I can't die. I've got a future. With the Doctor. You told
840,me!

886,SYLVIA: Can you hear that? 
887,[Ealing Road]
888,
889,(The driver gets out and waves at the taxi behind.)
890,
891,DRIVER: Hold on! Back up! 
892,"TAXI DRIVER: Oi, get a move on. "
893,[Car]
894,
895,DONNA: The traffic's stopping. 
896,SYLVIA: Something must have happened. 
897,[Ealing Road]
898,
899,ROSE: Tell him this. Two words. 
900,(Rose whispers in dying Donna's ear.)
901,
902,[Car]
903,
904,(The tailback is past her junction now.) 
905,"DONNA: Well, that decides it. I'm not sitting in a traffic jam. I'm"
906,going left. 
907,[Fortune Teller's tent]
908,
909,DONNA : I'm going left. Left. Left. 
910,"(Donna screams. Key events rewind, then the beetle drops from her"
911,back.) 
912,DONNA: What the hell is that? 
913,FORTUNE TELLER: You were so strong. What are you? What will you be?
914,What will you be? 
915,(The fortune teller runs out the back of the tent. The Doctor enters.) 
916,DOCTOR: Everything all right? 
917,"DONNA: Oh, God. "
918,(Donna hugs the Doctor.) 
919,DOCTOR: What was that for? 
920,DONNA: I don't know. 
921,"(Later, the Doctor is prodding the dead beetle with a stick.) "
922,DONNA: I can't remember. It's slipping away. You know like when you try
923,and think of a dream and it just sort of goes. 
924,"DOCTOR: Just got lucky, this thing. It's one of the Trickster's"
925,"Brigade. Changes a life in tiny little ways. Most times, the universe"
926,"just compensates around it, but with you? Great big parallel world. "
927,DONNA: Hold on. You said parallel worlds are sealed off. 
928,"DOCTOR: They are. But you had one created around you. Funny thing is,"
929,seems to be happening a lot to you. 
930,DONNA: How do you mean? 
931,"DOCTOR: Well, The Library and then this. "
932,"DONNA: Just goes with the job, I suppose. "
933,"DOCTOR: Sometimes I think there's way too much coincidence around you,"
934,"Donna. I met you once, then I met your grandfather, then I met you"
935,"again. In the whole wide universe, I met you for a second time. It's"
936,like something's binding us together. 
937,DONNA: Don't be so daft. I'm nothing special. 
938,"DOCTOR: Yes, you are. You're brilliant. "
939,ROSE : He thought you were brilliant. 
940,DONNA: She said that. 
941,DOCTOR: Who did? 
942,DONNA: That woman. I can't remember. 
943,"DOCTOR: Well, she never existed now. "
944,"DONNA: No, but she said the stars. She said the stars are going out. "
945,"DOCTOR: Yeah, but that world's gone. "
946,"DONNA: No, but she said it was all worlds. Every world. She said the"
947,darkness is coming even here. 
948,DOCTOR: Who was she? 
949,DONNA: I don't know. 
950,DOCTOR: What did she look like? 
951,DONNA: She was blonde. 
952,DOCTOR: What was her name? 
953,DONNA: I don't know. 
954,"DOCTOR: Donna, what was her name? "
955,DONNA: But she told me to warn you. She said two words. 
956,DOCTOR: What two words? What were they? What did she say? 
957,"DONNA: Bad Wolf. Well, what does it mean? "
958,(The Doctor runs outside. Every printed thing now says Bad Wolf. Even
959,the Tardis says Bad Wolf instead of Police Box.)
960,
961,[Tardis]
962,
963,"(The inside is lit by red emergency lighting, and"
964,the cloister bell tolls.) 
965,"DONNA: Doctor, what is it? What's Bad Wolf? "
966,DOCTOR: It's the end of the universe.
