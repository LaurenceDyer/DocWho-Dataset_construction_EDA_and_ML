18,One - The Powerful Enemy 
19, (The TARDIS materialises in a darkened cave.) 
20,(Spaceship 201 is down in the valley. It has a Union Flag on it's tail
21,and is broken in half. It's radar dish is working)
22,
23,[Spaceship living quarters]
24,
25,"(a young girl rushes in, delighted to hear the beep"
26,of a contact on the screen) 
27,VICKI: Bennett!
28,
29,[Spaceship corridor]
30,
31," VICKI: Bennett! The rescue ship's landed! Bennett,"
32,let me in! 
33,BENNETT : Come in.
34,
35, [Bennett's quarters]
36,
37,(a man is lying on the bunk) 
38,"VICKI: Bennett, the rescue ship's landed. It's arrived. We're being"
39,taken back. Isn't it marvellous? 
40,BENNETT: It can't be the ship. 
41,VICKI: Its quite clear on the detector. Listen. 
42,(They can hear the radar contact.) 
43,BENNETT: It must be a fault. Must be. Did you talk to them by radio? 
44,"VICKI: No. I was going to, but I thought I'd tell you first. I thought"
45,"you'd be pleased, Bennett. "
46,BENNETT: The rescue ship's not due for another three days. It can't
47,even find Dido unless we guide it down. You know that. 
48,VICKI: But it's showing on the screen. Come and look. I'll help you. 
49,BENNETT: Did you hear it land? 
50,"VICKI: No. No, I didn't, but it "
51,BENNETT: The rescue ship can't land silently. 
52,VICKI: It must have done. It's just got here early that's all. It is
53,here. It's as plain as anything on the screen. 
54,BENNETT: What's its location? 
55,VICKI: I don't know. Somewhere on the mountain. 
56,"BENNETT: Look, Vicki. I know how badly you want to get off this planet."
57,We both want to get away but its no good building up our hopes. Go and
58,"radio the rescue ship. You'll find your mistake� And Vicki, watch out"
59,for Koquillion. 
60,VICKI: I haven't seen him today. 
61,BENNETT: He'll be around somewhere. And remember he knows nothing about
62,the rescue ship. 
63,VICKI: I know. 
64,"BENNETT: So be careful. If he finds out, he'll kill both of us."
65,
66,[Spaceship living quarters] 
67, VICKI: Planet Dido to rescue ship. Planet Dido to
68,rescue ship. Come in please. Over. 
69,CAPTAIN : Rescue ship to planet Dido. Receiving you on strength
70,two. Over. 
71,VICKI: Is it true? Have you? Have you landed? Over. 
72,CAPTAIN : Landed? We're still sixty nine flying hours away. We're
73,proceeding on a normal course. We shall 
74,"VICKI: But you, you can't be. I mean� "
75,CAPTAIN : Now don't worry. We'll be there. Try to hold on just a
76,bit longer. We'll contact you for directions in seventeen hours from
77,"now. Repeat, seventeen hours. Breaking contact now. "
78,VICKI: No! 
79,CAPTAIN : Over and out. 
80,VICKI: No! Dido to rescue! Dido to rescue! 
81,(no reply) 
82,VICKI: Sixty nine hours away? Who's landed on the mountain?
83,
84,[Tardis]
85,
86, (The Doctor is asleep in his chair) 
87,BARBARA: And you know how the ship has a faint sort of trembling while
88,"we're moving? Well, I suddenly realised that it had stopped. "
89,"IAN: I believe you're right, Barbara. I think we have landed. But the"
90,Doctor's never slept through a landing before. 
91,BARBARA: Doctor. Doctor! 
92,IAN: Doctor! 
93,BARBARA: Wake up. 
94,DOCTOR: Hmm? What's the matter? What is it? What is it? Oh good
95,gracious me! Don't tell me I went off to sleep. 
96,"IAN: Yes, you did. "
97,DOCTOR: Oh! 
98,"IAN: At a very critical time. Oh well, I suppose it did you a world of"
99,good. 
100,"DOCTOR: Deep in the arms of Morpheus, hey my boy? Well, I feel a bit"
101,sticky. I must go and have a wash. 
102,"BARBARA: Oh, but Doctor, the trembling's stopped. "
103,"DOCTOR: Oh, my dear, I'm so glad you're feeling better. "
104,"BARBARA: No, not me, the ship. "
105,"DOCTOR: Oh, the. Oh my dear, I'm so sorry. "
106,"IAN: Doctor, we appear to have landed while you were asleep. "
107,"DOCTOR: What? Oh, I say, I must never allow this sort of thing again"
108,"now, must we? No. Well, all we have to do is to turn the power off. "
109,BARBARA: Then we have landed. 
110,"DOCTOR: Yes, er, excuse me, materialised, I think, is a better word."
111,"Well now, lets have a look and see what's doing."
112,"Yes, the air's very good. The temperature. Yes, wherever we are, I"
113,"think its nice and fine. (Yawns) Oh, do pardon me. Forgive me, I'm so"
114,"sorry. Yes. Well, I must say, this looks most promising. Now, lets have"
115,a little look shall we? 
116,(The scanner shows the cave.) 
117,IAN: Very dark. Can't really make out anything at all. It looks very
118,"rocky, whatever it is. "
119,"DOCTOR: Yes. It does somewhat. Might be a cave, or�even perhaps"
120,underground. 
121,BARBARA: You mean we could be trapped down here? 
122,DOCTOR: Oh. It doesn't necessarily mean anything my dear Barbara. We
123,"can, of course, always travel through�solid matter in flight� and all,"
124,"again, we can, we can take off again quite easily. No, I do think we"
125,"ought to step outside and have a look. I will too. Susan, er "
126,"BARBARA: Doctor, why don't you show me how to open the doors? "
127,"DOCTOR: Hmm? Yes, yes, yes, my dear. Of course, yes, yes, how silly of"
128,"me. Yes, number four switch. "
129,(and the doors open) 
130,"DOCTOR: Very good, very good. You won't, of course, try to do that"
131,"during transit, will you?"
132,
133,[Cave]
134,
135, IAN: It is a cave. You were right Doctor. 
136,BARBARA: Strange funny smell. Doesn't smell like anything on Earth. 
137,"DOCTOR: No, it doesn't my dear. No, no. But I do know that smell. "
138,IAN: You recognise it? 
139,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, more or less. Oh, have a look round, I should, but"
140,don't go too far away. Remember we haven't had much luck with these
141,caves during our travels. 
142,BARBARA: What are you going to do? 
143,"DOCTOR: Oh, I think I'm going to have a nap. "
144,(The Doctor returns to the Tardis) 
145,"IAN: A nap? Huh. Well that's a new one, isn't it? He's usually the"
146,first one to be up and dashing off for a look. 
147,BARBARA: Maybe we're going to see a new side to the Doctor. 
148,"IAN: Yes, well, he isn't getting any younger is he. You know, it's the"
149,"first time he's been to sleep during a landing. Barbara, I've got an"
150,idea he's getting a bit (hand gesture for senile) 
151,DOCTOR: Remember I can hear what you're saying. Pick up that stone for
152,"me, would you? "
153,"IAN: This one, Doctor? "
154,DOCTOR: Yes. 
155,IAN: Certainly. 
156,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
157,(The Doctor goes back inside) 
158,"BARBARA: Look, Ian, all the old associations are still in the ship. You"
159,can't expect him to say goodbye to Susan and then forget about her the
160,next minute. 
161,"IAN: No, I suppose not. I wonder what she's doing now? "
162,"BARBARA: If I know any�anything about David, she's learning to milk"
163,cows. 
164,"IAN: Yes, he's a nice chap, David. "
165,BARBARA: Come on. 
166,"IAN: There may be a way over here, you know. "
167,"BARBARA: Yes, but I think the sun is coming through that way. "
168,"IAN: Ah, so it is."
169,"(Ian and Barbara leave the cave, and something with spikes around its"
170,"neck, bug eyes and antennae is seen inspecting the Tardis)"
171,
172,[Ledge]
173,
174,(Ian and Barbara come out onto a ledge in front of
175,a sheer cliff) 
176,"IAN: Barbara, look! "
177,BARBARA: It's a spaceship. 
178,IAN: Yes� broken in two. 
179,IAN: Can you see on the side? A flag! It's from home! 
180,BARBARA: Yes! You know it must have crashed. 
181,"IAN: Yes, although you see those buildings? It might have been"
182,destroyed at the same time as they were on the ground. 
183,BARBARA: There's no movement. No sign of life at all. 
184,"IAN: No. No, there isn't, is there? Well, there must be people or"
185,things on this planet. 
186,BARBARA: Ian. 
187,IAN: Hmm? 
188,BARBARA: Are you going to tell the Doctor about this? 
189,IAN: Yes. Why not? 
190,"BARBARA: Well, knowing the Doctor, he'll want to go down there and"
191,investigate. 
192,"IAN: Well, for once I'd agree with him, Barbara. If there are any of"
193,those crew members left we should get in touch with them. 
194,BARBARA: Ian! 
195,(The thing that had been looking at the Tardis is behind them) 
196,KOQUILLION: You are strangers here. Answer my question. Do you come
197,from Earth? 
198,"BARBARA: Yes. Yes, we do. "
199,KOQUILLION: Where is your rocket ship? 
200,IAN: You've just come out of the cave. You must have seen it. 
201,KOQUILLION: You landed here�in that box? 
202,"BARBARA: Well I know it sounds fantastic, but we have no reason to lie"
203,to you. 
204,"IAN: Well, obviously you've had a good look around. Did you see any"
205,sign of another ship having landed? 
206,KOQUILLION: Are there any other crewmembers? 
207,"IAN: Yes, there is. There's one more and he's back in the ship. "
208,KOQUILLION: I would like to meet him. Go and fetch him. I will take you
209,all to the city. 
210,"IAN: Coming, Barbara? "
211,BARBARA: Yes. 
212,"(But the creature actually blocks her way, holding something like a"
213,wrench) 
214,KOQUILLION: Why are you frightened? 
215,BARBARA: Keep away. 
216,KOQUILLION: I am your friend. You can trust me. 
217,BARBARA: Can I? (The creature pushes Barbara over the ledge)
218,
219,[Tardis]
220,
221,(The Doctor is examining the rock and making notes)
222,
223,"DOCTOR: Oh, my writing gets worse and worse. Dear, dear, dear, dear,"
224,"dear. Well, undoubtedly we've landed on the planet Dido. How"
225,"remarkable. Well, I must say. it'll be rather nice to meet these"
226,friendly people again after all these years. Fancy landing back here
227,"again. I wonder if I were to tell Ian that it was deliberate, whether"
228,"he'd believe me or not? Oh no, of course, I was asleep. Oh, pity, pity,"
229,pity. 
230,[Ledge]
231,
232," (Koquillion uses his wrench, and there is an"
233,explosion in the passage to the cave)
234,
235,[Cave] 
236," DOCTOR: Chesterton! Chesterton! Where are you, my"
237,"dear boy? Oh, I can't, oh, I can't see anything. "
238,(The Doctor goes back inside the Tardis.) 
239,"(Meanwhile, Barbara is unconscious at the bottom of the cliff, holding"
240,a broken branch. The shadow of another person falls over her) 
241,(The Doctor comes out of the Tardis with a torch) 
242,"DOCTOR: Chesterton! Oh, my dear fellow, are you all right? "
243,IAN: Barbara. 
244,DOCTOR: Where is she? 
245,"IAN: Barbara. I thought she was with me. I, I heard her scream� "
246,"DOCTOR: Steady, steady, steady. "
247,IAN: I went back and an explosion. 
248,"DOCTOR: Come on, come on, get your breath back. Now, now then, you all"
249,right? 
250,IAN: Yes� 
251,"DOCTOR: well, let's try and look for her, shall we? "
252,"IAN: Yes, it's�this way. "
253,"DOCTOR: Be careful now, be careful. Oh, good gracious, the whole roof's"
254,fallen in! 
255,IAN: This blocks the cave! Barbara! 
256,(Ian tries to move the rocks) 
257,"DOCTOR: Oh, I hope we shan't get another fall. I don't think the Tardis"
258,is likely to 
259,"IAN: No use. Doctor, this wasn't an accident. "
260,"DOCTOR: What are you talking about, my boy? "
261,"IAN: Oh it was a�thing, a repulsive thing with a�hideous face. "
262,DOCTOR: With hands and feet like claws? 
263,"IAN: Yes, that's it. How do you know? "
264,"DOCTOR: Well, this is the planet Dido. I've been here before, I know"
265,them very well. 
266,IAN: What? 
267,DOCTOR: They're very friendly people. 
268,IAN: Friendly? 
269,DOCTOR: Yes. 
270,"IAN: Oh, it certainly wasn't friendly to us. Must have kept Barbara"
271,back. That scream. Barbara! 
272,DOCTOR: Oh don't for heavens sake start scratching there. Try and find
273,"another way out. This thing, was it armed? "
274,"IAN: No, no, it wasn't. Wait a minute, it was carrying some sort of"
275,jewelled club. About so long. 
276,"DOCTOR: With a big head, resembling a spanner? "
277,IAN: Yes. 
278,DOCTOR: Yes. 
279,IAN: I don't know why you bother to ask. 
280,"DOCTOR: Yes, that may account for this. "
281,IAN: What? 
282,"DOCTOR: When I was here last time, if I remember rightly, they'd just"
283,"perfected this thing. It's a ray, used in construction work. "
284,IAN: Ahh. 
285,"DOCTOR: Now look here, what about Barbara, are you all right? Are you"
286,capable? 
287,"IAN: Yes, I'm not too bad. "
288,"DOCTOR: Come along. Don't just sit there, my dear boy, stand up, stand"
289,"up. Come along, that's it, mind your head. It's only dust. No bones"
290,broken. 
291,IAN: Thank you. Doctor. The most thorough-going medical I've ever had. 
292,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's a pity I didn't get that degree, isn't it? Excuse me."
293,
294,IAN: You say these people were friendly? 
295,DOCTOR: Really. Very friendly people. 
296,"IAN: If that's a sample, I'll take the Daleks anytime. "
297,"DOCTOR: Now look here, you take yourself off there and try and find"
298,Barbara. 
299,IAN: Yes. 
300,DOCTOR: Come along and be careful. 
301,"IAN: Yeah, we need to be careful. These people are dangerous. "
302,DOCTOR: But why? What could have happened to changed them? I wonder.

305,
306,(Vicki is making a bed when she hears a noise. She
307,grabs some stones and pretends to be examining them when -) 
308,KOQUILLION: You have been outside. Stand up! What were you doing? 
309,VICKI: Walking. 
310,"KOQUILLION: In future, you will go no further than fifty yards from"
311,this ship. Do you understand? You were dragging something. A sack. 
312,"VICKI: Oh, just some stones, I collect them. They're very beautiful. "
313,KOQUILLION: I'm going to talk to Bennett. Remember you both owe your
314,lives to me. 
315,VICKI: I heard a sound from the mountain. An explosion. 
316,KOQUILLION: A space machine has arrived. 
317,VICKI: People? 
318,KOQUILLION: A warlike people. They wanted to pillage the ship! I could
319,"not save them from my people, as I do Bennett and yourself. They're"
320,"walled up in a cave. If they're not dead already, they will die of"
321,hunger and thirst. 
322,"VICKI: I bet you never gave them a chance, you could have (he raises"
323,the club) I'm sorry. 
324,"KOQUILLION: Remember, I am the only one who can save you from my"
325,people. You should be grateful. I am your only protection!
326,
327,[Spaceship corridor]
328,
329, BENNETT : You can't come in. 
330,KOQUILLION: It is Koquillion! Open the door.
331,
332,[Spaceship living quarters]
333,
334,"(Vicki listens at the door to the corridor, then"
335,goes back to the bed she made and removes blankets to reveal Barbara) 
336,VICKI: Koquillion has just seen me helping you here. I knew he would. I
337,knew. He knows everything. Everything! 
338,"BARBARA: Well, tell me "
339,VICKI: Shh! He'll hear you. 
340,"BARBARA: Oh, all right. "
341,"VICKI: Please, stay there. He might come back. You don't know him like"
342,I do. 
343,"BARBARA: Yes, but listen, what's your name? "
344,VICKI: Vicki. 
345,BARBARA: Is that short for Victoria? 
346,"VICKI: No, just Vicki. V,I,C,K,I. "
347,"BARBARA: I'm Barbara. Look, tell me more about this Koquillion. "
348,"VICKI: He just keeps us here, Bennett and me. There's a rescue ship on"
349,the way. He doesn't know about that. But he'll find out. I know he
350,will. 
351,BARBARA: But why does he keep you here? 
352,"VICKI: They, they killed all the crew. We, when we landed, we made"
353,contact here. Everyone on board was invited to a grand sort of meeting.
354,"I couldn't go, I was ill, a fever or something. I stayed here that"
355,"night. I remember waking up. A thunderstorm, I thought, but it was an"
356,"explosion. Bennett. Bennett dragged himself back. I was ill for days, I"
357,didn't know about it til later. I came around and�found Bennett. He
358,"can't walk. We just wait, and then Koquillion. "
359,(she falls sobbing into Barbara's arms) 
360,"BARBARA: Well, if his people killed all your crew, why did, doesn't he"
361,kill you. 
362,VICKI: We don't know. My father was taking me. My father. (she dries
363,her eyes) Your ship. Is your ship still here? 
364,BARBARA: Yes. 
365,"VICKI: I've just remembered. He told me. Didn't you hear him? They,"
366,they've killed all your crew too.
367,
368,[Cave passage]
369,
370," IAN: Oh, I wonder how much further, Doctor? "
371,"DOCTOR: Oh, I can't understand it. I just can't understand it. Violence"
372,is totally alien to people on this planet. 
373,"IAN: Oh, well, people change, Doctor. New leader, different set of"
374,circumstances. 
375,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, my dear Chesterton, no. All the more reason for"
376,"people on this planet to hate death and destruction. My dear boy, when"
377,"I was here before, the, what, the total population amounted to, a"
378,handle of people. Merely a hundred. 
379,IAN: Is that all? 
380,"DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. All the more reason for holding onto life. Peace,"
381,"friendship, happiness. This means everything to the people here. "
382,"IAN: Yes. Yes, I see what you mean. Well, you ready to carry on? "
383,"DOCTOR: Me? Carry on? My dear fellow, it was you that stopped."
384,
385,[Spaceship living quarters]
386,
387," VICKI: Sorry, Barbara, I forgot all about your"
388,cuts and bruises. 
389,BARBARA: Oh it could be worse. It's the arm mainly. I must have
390,strained it catching hold of that tree to break my fall. 
391,VICKI: There. How's that? 
392,BARBARA: That feels much better. 
393,VICKI: I wonder if Koquillion's gone? 
394,BARBARA: What are the other people like? 
395,"VICKI: Mmm? Oh, he's the only one we see. They live quite near here, I"
396,"believe but, well, I don't know. This fires a flare. "
397,BARBARA: Is that for the rescue ship? 
398,"VICKI: Yes, I always keep it ready. There's room to land round here,"
399,you know. 
400,BARBARA: It'll all be ending for you soon then. 
401,VICKI: Yes. 
402,"BARBARA: Well, you don't sound very sure. "
403,VICKI: There's always Koquillion. He could stop us. He could keep me
404,here forever. What are you looking like that for? 
405,BARBARA: Like what? 
406,"VICKI: You're sorry for me, aren't you? I'm perfectly all right, you"
407,"know. I don't care if nobody ever comes, I'm fine. I'm perfectly all"
408,right. 
409,(They hear a noise) 
410,VICKI: Quick! 
411,(She hides Barbara under the blankets again) 
412,"VICKI: Oh, Bennett. "
413,BENNETT: He's gone. He tried to get things out of me but I didn't tell
414,him. 
415,VICKI: No. 
416,BENNETT: I didn't tell him about the rescue ship. 
417,VICKI: No. 
418,BENNETT: He told me about the people on the mountain. He's killed them.
419,"We've got to stick together, Vicki. He's killed them. "
420,"VICKI: No, he hasn't, Bennett. Not all of them anyway. "
421,(And she reveals Barbara)
422,
423,[Cave passageway]
424,
425," IAN: The ledge is narrowing out now, Doctor. "
426,"DOCTOR: What's that, my boy, What? What's that? "
427,"(The Doctor slips, and Ian grabs him.) "
428,"IAN: Oh, oh, careful! "
429,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! I say, look, have you"
430,noticed the ledge? It's narrowing out. 
431,"IAN: Yes, Doctor. "
432,"DOCTOR: Wait, wait. "
433,IAN: Huh? 
434,"DOCTOR: Point the torch, shine it down there. You see that? It's quite"
435,a chasm. 
436,IAN: Yes. It certainly is. Not very much to hold onto here either.
437,We'll just have to keep ourselves�pressed against the rock face. 
438,"DOCTOR: My dear boy, if I pressed myself any harder against this thing"
439,I would be doing myself an injury. 
440,(There's a roar) 
441,IAN: What was that? 
442,"DOCTOR: Well, it's not me, is it. Shine the torch down there! "
443,"(The torch reveals another one of Koquillion's race, but with no legs) "
444,DOCTOR: What� 
445,IAN: What's that nightmare? 
446,DOCTOR: Isn't it sufficient that it�it's down there and we're up here?
447,Hmm? 
448,IAN: Yes. It's got eyes. I saw them. Green. Used to daylight. Must have
449,come in from the outside. 
450,"DOCTOR: Oh. Very good, yes. Very intelligent reasoning. So good I might"
451,have said the same thing myself. 
452,"IAN: Got to get out of here. What we need are some good handholds. Oh,"
453,"here we are, all provided. "
454,(There are carvings with rings in them) 
455,"IAN: You're right, Doctor. Somebody's been this way before. "
456,"DOCTOR: Well, now, be careful. "
457,"IAN: Yes I will, just hold onto that. (the torch.) Try this. It's all"
458,right. 
459,IAN: Yes. Give me the torch. Swing yourself over. All right? Okay? 
460,DOCTOR: Yes. 
461,(Ian reaches for the third handle.) 
462,"IAN: Watch this one. It's loose. Oh! hurry up, I've pulled it out! "
463,DOCTOR: What? 
464,"IAN: Oh, I'm over. Can you manage? "
465,"DOCTOR: Chesterton, it's oil. It's got oil on it. "
466,IAN: What's that noise? 
467,DOCTOR: Come back here. They've trapped you into pulling this thing
468,out. 
469,"IAN: What's that noise, Doctor? I "
470,(Ian is trapped between two lots of horizontal metal spikes coming
471,straight out of the wall in front and behind him) 
472,DOCTOR: Don't go any further! 
473,IAN: What? I can't go either way! 
474,"(More spikes come out of the wall, from ground to hip level) "
475,"IAN: Doctor, They're pushing me towards the edge!"

481,
482,(Ian puts a hand on the spikes) 
483,"IAN: Doctor, they're razor sharp! "
484,"DOCTOR: Take your coat off, my boy, and throw it over the blades. "
485,IAN: Hold the torch for me please. 
486,DOCTOR: Right. Now swing yourself round. 
487,IAN: Give me a hand. 
488,"DOCTOR: Come on, come on, come on. "
489,(Ian manages to swing round the spikes) 
490,IAN: Thanks. I thought I'd had it. What do you think this is for? 
491,DOCTOR: I've no idea. I've never seen it before in my life. 
492,IAN: I suppose this operates the knives. 
493,"DOCTOR: Yes, quite so. We've got to get this thing back in its place. "
494,IAN: The executioner sounds disappointed. 
495,"DOCTOR: Yes, never mind about all that. Come on, give me a hand."
496,Barbara's still outside. She might be in grave danger.

500,(Bennett is on the bunk with Barbara checking for a
501,heartbeat) 
502,"VICKI: Is he, is he dead? "
503,"BARBARA: No, it must have been the strain of walking out here made him"
504,collapse. How do you feel? 
505,"VICKI: This is Barbara, Bennett. "
506,BENNETT: Koquillion told me of your arrival. He's killed your friends. 
507,BARBARA: I don't think so. I'm sure they're all right. 
508,BENNETT: Koquillion doesn't make mistakes. 
509,"BARBARA: Well he did about me. You know, the next time he visits us, we"
510,"might be able to surprise him. He doesn't know I'm here, does he, so we"
511,could set a trap and overpower him. 
512,"BENNETT: No, no. "
513,"VICKI: It's a marvellous idea, isn't it, Bennett. "
514,BENNETT: No! 
515,"BARBARA: Well, surely it's worth a try? You wouldn't be any worse off"
516,than you are now. 
517,"BENNETT: The Mir rescue ship is due to arrive, or hasn't Vicki told you"
518,"that. We have to sit still, do as he says. Maybe we'll have a chance of"
519,"escaping, get back to Earth. "
520,VICKI: We could still go. 
521,"BENNETT: You're just a child, you don't know what you're talking about."
522,"We get rid of Koquillion, we gain nothing. If the plan fails, he kills"
523,us. 
524,"VICKI: Bennett's right, Barbara. "
525,BENNETT: Course I'm right. Just because I lie on that bed all day
526,"doesn't mean I've lost the use of my brain. Help me to my room, please."
527,
528,[Spaceship corridor]
529,
530," BENNETT: You will do as Koquillion says, won't"
531,you? Now you do understand the consequences? Thank you. 
532,BARBARA: I'll help you to your bed. 
533,"BENNETT: I'm all right. I said, I'm all right! I can manage. "
534,(Bennett slams the door in Barbara's face) 
535,"VICKI: I'd better go and collect the water, it gets dark early on Dido."
536,"Will you lay the table, Barbara? "
537,"BARBARA: Yes. Yes, all right. "
538,VICKI: I'll show you where the things are.

541,
542, DOCTOR: There you are. I think that's got it back.
543,Watch! 
544,(The blades retract) 
545,"IAN: Yes. You've done it, Doctor. There they go. Well, lets hope there"
546,aren't any more surprises like that waiting for us. Come on. 
547,(The doctor stops to examine the rock carving where the blades had come
548,out.) 
549,"IAN: Well, come on, Doctor."
550,"(Meanwhile, Vicki is carrying jerry-cans of water whilst being watched"
551,"by a Didonian, again with no legs) "
552,"IAN: Daylight, Doctor! We must be nearly there. "
553,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think you're right. Chesterton! "
554,"IAN: Look out, Doctor. Don't go too near the edge. "
555,"DOCTOR: Oh, right. Look, there's a door. "
556,IAN: What? 
557,DOCTOR: Now that must lead somewhere. 
558,"IAN: Yes, it is. "
559,"DOCTOR: Yes, but there'll be no time to open that. No, come on, let's"
560,go the obvious way. 
561,IAN: All right. 
562,"DOCTOR: Go on, go on. "
563,IAN: Now mind this edge. 
564,DOCTOR: Just so long as nobody starts creeping up behind us.

568,"(Through the porthole, Barbara spots a Didonian"
569,about to pounce on Vicki. She grabs the flare gun from the cupboard and

574, BARBARA: Vicki! 
575,VICKI: No! No don't! No!

579,
580,(Ian and the Doctor hear the shot and death cry
581,echoing) 
582,DOCTOR: What was that? 
583,IAN: Horrible. 
584,DOCTOR: What is it? 
585,IAN: Come on.
586,
587,[Spaceship living quarters]
588,
589, VICKI: You killed Sandy. Why? What made you? 
590,BARBARA: He was almost on top of you! 
591,VICKI: How could you do it? Sandy only wanted some food. 
592,BARBARA: But he was going to attack you! 
593,VICKI: Sandy only ever eat plants. I trained him to come here for food.
594,
595,"BARBARA: Well, I didn't know that did I? I mean, how could I? "
596,"VICKI: I shouted, you wouldn't listen. "
597,"BARBARA: Look, all I could see was its jaws. Anyway it suddenly started"
598,screeching I thought that 
599,VICKI: You killed him! You killed him! 
600,(The Doctor and Ian enter) 
601,DOCTOR: Barbara! 
602,BARBARA: Doctor! 
603,DOCTOR: My dear Barbara! 
604,IAN: Barbara! 
605,"BARBARA: Oh Doctor, you're all right! "
606,"DOCTOR: Oh, I've never felt better in my life! "
607,"(Koquillion comes out of the door in the cave passageway, follows their"
608,"footprints to the ledge, and looks down on the spaceship)"
609,
610,[Spaceship living quarters]
611,
612," DOCTOR: That's better, that's better. Now blow"
613,"your nose and wipe your face. That's it. I don't like saying it, my"
614,"dear, but you do look a bit of a mess, you know. "
615,"IAN: Yes, cheer up, Vicki. And don't forget, if old Kokylikin comes"
616,"round, I've always got this. "
617,"VICKI: You mustn't, Ian. I keep telling you why we did what he said."
618,"You'll spoil it, you'll spoil everything. "
619,"DOCTOR: Now, now, now. It's going to be all right. We're not going to"
620,"jeopardise your safety or your rescue. Now, first of all, I'd like to"
621,have a talk with this Mister Bennett of yours. 
622,"VICKI: Oh, I keep "
623,DOCTOR: Will you take me to him? 
624,"VICKI: I keep telling you, the rescue ship's on its way. It's going to"
625,take us back to Earth. Can't you understand? 
626,DOCTOR: Yes. 
627,"BARBARA: Look Vicki, I know you've been here a long time, but you're"
628,underestimating what Koquillion can do. 
629,"VICKI: Yes, you're right. I've been here a long time. I know what it's"
630,like here. You've only just come and you're trying to ruin things. It
631,was all right before. It was. The rescue ship's coming and nobody asked
632,you to come here. Nobody. 
633,"DOCTOR: Now, Vicki. "
634,VICKI: Go away. 
635,(Ian and Barbara leave) 
636,"DOCTOR: Vicki, my dear. Sit down. You don't mean that, do you? Well, do"
637,"you? Mmm? Good, good. Now, I've listened to all you've said and I've"
638,thoroughly understood. We're here to help you. This is all we're going
639,"to try to do. You know, we're not going to ruin things for you. "
640,VICKI: Bennett says that when we get back we've got to tell them on
641,Earth what they did to us here. He thinks this planet should be wiped
642,out. 
643,DOCTOR: Yes. 
644,VICKI: He says Koquillion shouldn't be made to get away with what he's
645,done to us. 
646,"DOCTOR: I think I agree with Bennett, at least about Koquillion. But"
647,"don't you think there's just a chance, just a little chance that my"
648,"ideas might prove the better ones? Hmm? Good, good. Now, I'll go and"
649,"have a talk with Mister Bennett and I promise you, I'll listen to"
650,everything he says. Hmm? 
651,VICKI: I'll take you to him. 
652,DOCTOR: Splendid.
653,
654,[Spaceship corridor]
655,
656," DOCTOR: Yes, well now, I don't think you need to"
657,"wait, my dear. You go back with Ian and Barbara. Hmm? "
658,VICKI: Barbara. 
659,"DOCTOR: Oh, now, now, now, You mustn't be like that. You're not giving"
660,"her much of a chance, are you? She's nice, you know. You'll like her. "
661,VICKI: She killed Sandy. 
662,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, so might I have done! "
663,VICKI: No. 
664,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
665,"VICKI: Well, you haven't got the sort of face that kills things "
666,"DOCTOR: And Barbara has, I suppose. Ay? You know she was frightened,"
667,frightened for your safety. She thought you were going to be hurt. Good
668,"gracious me, you mustn't behave like that. Now, look here, I think the"
669,"best thing for you to do is to pop along back there, don't you, hmm?"
670,"Eh? You must believe what Barbara did, try and understand my dear, and"
671,"why she did it. Just for me, eh? "
672,(The Doctor knocks on Bennett's door) 
673,DOCTOR: Mister Bennett? 
674,BENNETT : You can't come in. 
675,"(The Doctor forces the door open, but it sticks) "
676,DOCTOR: I want to talk to you. Oh dear. 
677,(He finds a piece of girder and uses it as a battering ram)

680,
681,(Ian and Barbara enter) 
682,IAN: The Doctor gone to see Miser Bennett? 
683,"VICKI: Yes, I took him. "
684,"IAN: Good, good. "
685,VICKI: Barbara? 
686,BARBARA: Yes? 
687,VICKI: I'm sorry. Really I am. 
688,"BARBARA: I'm sorry too, about Sandy. "
689,"VICKI: Well, you didn't know. I'm afraid I've got rather used to being"
690,on my own. 
691,IAN: We know how you feel Vicki. We felt the same way ourselves at
692,first. 
693,"VICKI: At first? I don't understand. You're from Earth too, aren't you?"
694,
695,"BARBARA: Yes, but it goes a bit deeper than that. "
696,VICKI: How do you mean? 
697,"BARBARA: Well, what was the year when you left Earth? "
698,"VICKI: 2493, of course. My mother had just died and Daddy wanted to get"
699,away so he took a job on the planet Astra. 
700,IAN: You were on your way there and you crashed here? 
701,VICKI: Yes. But why did you ask me the year? What year did you leave? 
702,"IAN: Well, you see Vicki, our space ship, well, isn't like this one. It"
703,travels through time. 
704,BARBARA: We left in 1963. 
705,VICKI: 1963! But that means you're about five hundred and fifty years
706,old. 
707,"BARBARA: Why, yes, I suppose I am. Yes, it's a way of looking at it,"
708,but I'll try not to look at it too often. 
709,"VICKI: They didn't have time machines in 1963, they didn't know"
710,anything then. 
711,"IAN: Oh, we weren't entirely ignorant, young lady. Even the Doctor"
712,thought it was worth paying us a visit. That's how we got mixed up with
713,him in the first place. 
714,"BARBARA: The Doctors from a different age, a different planet"
715,altogether. 
716,"VICKI: I don't believe you at all, you're joking with me. The Doctor, a"
717,time traveller? 
718,IAN + BARBARA: Yes!

721,
722," (The Doctor finds the room is empty, so he does a"
723,search) 
724,DOCTOR: What have we here? Tape recordings for what? 
725,(He presses play) 
726,BENNETT : You can't come in. 
727,(Then he turns up the volume on a receiver) 
728,"VICKI : Oh yes, I like the Doctor."
729,
730,[Spaceship living quarters]
731,
732," VICKI: Its funny, but as soon as he walked in, I"
733,felt that you could trust him. But why does he wear those funny
734,clothes? And that long white hair. 
735,"BARBARA: Vicki, I've told you, the Doctor comes from another time."
736,
737,[Bennett's quarters]
738,
739," VICKI : Oh, don't start that again. "
740,"DOCTOR: Silly child, silly child. "
741,"DOCTOR: Intercom systems, tape recordings. Now, I wonder what else,"
742,hmm? 
743,(He finds a lever that opens a trap door in the floor) 
744,"DOCTOR: Yes, I see, an easy way to get out of a locked room."
745,
746,[Spaceship living quarters]
747,
748, IAN: They're taking a long time aren't they? 
749,VICKI: I don't think we should disturb them. 
750,"IAN: Well, they can always tell me to go away."
751,
752,[Spaceship corridor]

754, IAN: Doctor? Mister Bennett? Can I come in?
755,Doctor? Doctor!

769,altar and a chest full of vestments)
770,
771,[Spaceship living quarters]
772,
773, BARBARA: But where could they have gone to? 
774,VICKI: Perhaps Koquillion came. 
775,"IAN: No, we would have heard him. Anyway, the Doctor would surely have"
776,warned us. 
777,BARBARA: He wouldn't go off without telling us. What do you think we
778,ought to do? 
779,VICKI: I think we should stay here. 
780,"IAN: No. Go back to the Tardis. In the end, the Doctor'll make for"
781,"that. Come on, quickly."
782,
783,[Chamber]
784,
785," DOCTOR: Come in. Come in, won't you? I've been"
786,waiting to talk to you. 
787,(Koquillion enters behind the Doctor) 
788,"DOCTOR: This used to be the Peoples' Hall of Judgement. Fitting, in the"
789,"present circumstances don't you think, hmm? Mister Bennett, may I"
790,remind you that masks and robes such as you are wearing are only used
791,"on absolutely ceremonial occasions, hmm? "
792,(Bennett removes the mask) 
793,BENNETT: Are you finished? 
794,"DOCTOR: Yes, I had hoped that you would continue. This elaborate plan"
795,"must have been conceived for some reason. What, hmm? "
796,BENNETT: To save my life. I killed a crewmember on the spaceship to
797,Astra. I was arrested. The ship crashed. My crime hadn't been radioed
798,to Earth. I knew if I could get rid of the other crewmembers. 
799,DOCTOR: Get rid of the other crewmembers and blame their deaths on the
800,"Dido people, hmm? "
801,"BENNETT: When we crash landed, the inhabitants invited us all to a"
802,"grand meeting. It was simple. I just arranged an explosive, using the"
803,"ships armaments. The whole thing went up. All the inhabitants, the"
804,"crew, the whole race. "
805,DOCTOR: You destroyed a whole planet to save your own skin. You're
806,insane. 
807,BENNETT: The girl didn't know I'd been arrested. When we get back to
808,"Earth, she'd support my story. I dressed up as Koquillion to show her"
809,how terrible the people here were. 
810,"DOCTOR: If that happened, your guilt would have been hidden forever,"
811,hmm? 
812,BENNETT: If it happened? Nothing's changed. There's only three more
813,"people for Koquillion to kill, that's all. "
814,"(They struggle for the club, and there is an explosion. The club is"
815,"broken in the fall. The Doctor and Bennett fight, with Bennett easily"
816,overpowering him and starting to choke him when two people dressed in
817,white appear) 
818,BENNETT: No! I thought I'd killed all of you! 
819,"(Bennett flees, and there's a scream. Presumably he fell off that"
820,narrow ledge outside. The Doctor passes out)
821,
822,[Tardis]
823,
824, BARBARA: He's coming round. 
825,"DOCTOR: Oh, Barbara, Ian. We're back in the ship, eh? "
826,"IAN: Yes, I took the liberty of borrowing your key. "
827,"BARBARA: Doctor, we found you outside. "
828,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's, they left me outside. "
829,IAN: They? Who? 
830,"DOCTOR: Oh, er, two strangers. Yes, Bennett's dead. Bennett was"
831,"Koquillion, you know. "
832,IAN: What? Bennett Koquillion? 
833,DOCTOR: Yes. 
834,"IAN: What, well, why, why, Doctor? "
835,"BARBARA: No, no, no, no, not now Ian, He's in no condition to answer"
836,questions. 
837,"DOCTOR: The girl, Vicki, now. Did you, did you bring her? "
838,BARBARA: Yes. 
839,DOCTOR: Where? 
840,BARBARA: She's waiting outside. 
841,"DOCTOR: Oh, I must get some fresh air. Yes, I want to have a talk with"
842,that child. 
843,IAN: Are you all right? 
844,"DOCTOR: Yes, now don't fuss especially, I'm quite all right, my boy."
845,I'm quite all right. 
846,(The Doctor leaves) 
847,"BARBARA: Ian, what about Vicki? I wish we could take her with us. Hmm?"
848,"Well, we can't leave her here, can we?"
849,
850,[Cave]
851,
852," DOCTOR: That's about what happened, and that's"
853,all. 
854,VICKI: Then Bennett murdered my father. Then I've got nobody. 
855,"DOCTOR: My dear. My dear, why don't you come with us, hmm? "
856,VICKI: In that old box? 
857,DOCTOR: We can travel anywhere and everywhere in that old box as you
858,call it. Regardless of space and time. 
859,VICKI: Then it is a time machine? 
860,"DOCTOR: And if you like adventure, my dear, I can promise you an"
861,"abundance of it. Apart from all that, well you'll be amongst friends."
862,"Hmm? Well? Now, suppose I leave you here for a moment to think about"
863,"it, hmm?"
864,
865,[Tardis]
866,
867, BARBARA: Doctor? 
868,DOCTOR: Yes? 
869,BARBARA: We were talking about Vicki and we were wondering whether 
870,"IAN: Yes, do you think er, Vicki "
871,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, I can see that we've all reached the same"
872,"decision. Now, I suggest we try and get the answer from the child, hmm?"
873,"Vicki? Vicki, my dear, come in. "
874,"VICKI: But its huge! And, well, the outside is just, well "
875,"BARBARA: Vicki, are you going to come with us? "
876,"VICKI: Oh I, I'd like to. Yes, if you'll have me."

881,Dido. Come in please. This is rescue ship calling Dido. Rescue ship
882,calling Dido.

886,(The men smash the radio.)
887,
888,[Tardis]
889,
890,(in flight) 
891,IAN: So there were survivors on Dido? Bennett didn't kill them all? 
892,DOCTOR: They have their planet back to themselves again. And somehow I
893,don't think they will allow that rescue ship to land. Well. 
894,"IAN: Hmm. That isn't why you brought Vicki along with us, is it Doctor?"
895,
896,"DOCTOR: No, Chesterton, no, it wasn't the reason. We shall be"
897,materialising quite soon. Perhaps we shall be able to get a rest this
898,time.
