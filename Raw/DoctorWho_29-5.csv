21,
22,SEC: These humans will become like me. Prepare them
23,for hybridisation. 
24,(The Doctor sneaks away behind some equipment. The pigmen take the
25,others.) 
26,MARTHA: Leave me alone! Don't you dare! 
27,(Happy Days are Here Again starts playing.) 
28,SEC: What is that sound? 
29,"DOCTOR: Ah, well, now, that would be me. "
30,(He puts the radio down by a Bunsen burner and walks up to Sec.) 
31,DOCTOR: Hello. Surprise. Boo. Et cetera. 
32,SEC: Doctor. 
33,DALEK: The enemy of the Daleks. 
34,DALEK 3: Exterminate. 
35,SEC: Wait! 
36,"DOCTOR: Well, then. A new form of Dalek. Fascinating and very clever. "
37,SEC: The Cult of Skaro escaped your slaughter. 
38,DOCTOR: How did you end up in 1930? 
39,SEC: Emergency temporal shift. 
40,"DOCTOR: Oh, that must have roasted up your power cells, huh? Time was,"
41,"four Daleks could have conquered the world, but instead you're skulking"
42,"away, hidden in the dark, experimenting. All of which results in you. "
43,SEC: I am Dalek in human form. 
44,"DOCTOR: What does it feel like? You can talk to me, Dalek Sec. It is"
45,"Dalek Sec, isn't it? That's your name? You've got a name and a mind of"
46,your own. Tell me what you're thinking right now. 
47,SEC: I feel humanity. 
48,(Sec turns away.) 
49,DOCTOR: Good. That's good. 
50,"SEC: I feel everything we wanted from mankind, which is ambition,"
51,"hatred, aggression and war. Such a genius for war. "
52,"DOCTOR: No, that's not what humanity means. "
53,"SEC: I think it does. At heart, this species is so very Dalek. "
54,"DOCTOR: All right, so what have you achieved then, with this Final"
55,"Experiment, eh? Nothing! Because I can show you what you're missing"
56,with this thing. A simple little radio. 
57,DALEK 3: What is the purpose of that device? 
58,"DOCTOR: Well, exactly. It plays music. What's the point of that? Oh,"
59,"with music, you can dance to it, sing with it, fall in love to it."
60,Unless you're a Dalek of course. Then it's all just noise. 
61,(The Doctor aims his sonic screwdriver at the little radio. It emits a
62,"shriek that hurts Sec and the Daleks, and the pigmen.) "
63,DOCTOR: Run! 
64,(The prisoners escape and the Doctor follows them) 
65,DALEK: Protect the hybrid! 
66,DALEKS: Protect. Protect. Protect. 
67,(The humans run back down the sewers. Laszlo stays with the pigmen.) 
68,DALEK: Report status. 
69,"SEC: Pain. Pain of the flesh, like no other Dalek has felt for"
70,thousands of years. 
71,DALEK 1: The Doctor has escaped. 
72,SEC: Then find him. Find him. 
73,DALEK 1: Find the Doctor. The prisoners must be recaptured.
74,
75,[Sewers]
76,
77,"DOCTOR: Come on! Move, move, move, move, move! "
78,"(The Doctor leads the group to where Tallulah is standing, lost.) "
79,"DOCTOR: And you, Tallulah! Run! "
80,TALLULAH: What's happened to Laszlo? 
81,(Martha drags Tallulah along. Laszlo hangs back as the pigmen and
82,Daleks search the sewers. The Doctor leads the group to the ladder.) 
83,DOCTOR: Come on! Everyone up! Come on! 
84,"(In the laboratory, Sec picks up the broken radio and strokes its"
85,Bakelite surface.) 
86,DALEK 1: They have ascended. Return to base. 
87,(The pigmen leave.) 
88,DALEK 1: Request information. What is your opinion of Dalek Sec? 
89,DALEK 3: We were created to follow him. 
90,DALEK 1: But you have doubts. 
91,(The Daleks check that they cannot be overheard.) 
92,DALEK 3: Affirmative.
93,
94,[Hooverville]
95,
96,"SOLOMON: These Daleks, they sound like the stuff of"
97,nightmares. And they want to breed? 
98,"DOCTOR: They're splicing themselves onto human bodies, and if I'm"
99,"right, they've got a farm of breeding stock right here in Hooverville."
100,You've got to get everyone out. 
101,SOLOMON: Hooverville's the lowest place a man can fall. There's nowhere
102,else to go. 
103,"DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Solomon. You've got to scatter. Go anywhere. Down to"
104,"the railroads, travel across state. Just get out of New York. "
105,SOLOMON: There's got to be a way to reason with these things. 
106,MARTHA: There's not a chance. 
107,"FRANK: You ain't seen them, boss. "
108,"DOCTOR: Daleks are bad enough at anytime, but right now they're"
109,vulnerable. That makes them more dangerous than ever. 
110,(One of the lookouts hears a grunt. He uses a pair of binoculars and
111,finally spots a pigman looks from behind a tree. He blows his whistle
112,and runs as the pigmen break cover.) 
113,SENTRY: They're coming! They're coming! 
114,SOLOMON: A sentry. He must have seen something. 
115,SENTRY: They're here! I've seen them! Monsters! They're monsters! 
116,DOCTOR: It's started. 
117,SOLOMON: We're under attack! Everyone to arms! 
118,(Rifles are handed out.) 
119,"FRANK: I'm ready, boss, but all of you, find a weapon! Use anything. "
120,(Some people run away.) 
121,SOLOMON: Come back! We've got to stick together! It's not safe out
122,there! Come back! 
123,(The pigmen get into the camp and start grabbing victims.) 
124,MARTHA: We need to get out of the park. 
125,DOCTOR: We can't. They're on all sides. They're driving everyone back
126,towards us. 
127,TALLULAH: We're trapped. 
128,SOLOMON: Then we stand together. Gather round. Everybody come to me.
129,"You there, Jethro, Harry, Seamus, stay together. "
130,"(The armed men form a circle around the women, by the campfire.) "
131,SOLOMON: They can't take all of us. 
132,(The shooting starts.) 
133,MARTHA: If we can just hold them off till daylight. 
134,"DOCTOR: Oh, Martha, they're just the foot soldiers. "
135,"MARTHA: Oh, my God. "
136,(A Dalek comes flying towards them. Number 3 according to its logo.) 
137,SOLOMON: What in this world is? 
138,SENTRY: It's the devil. A devil in the sky. God save us all. It's
139,damnation. 
140,FRANK: Oh yeah? We'll see about that! 
141,(Frank fires his shotgun at the Dalek. The shot bounces off with a
142,clang.) 
143,DOCTOR: That's not going to work. 
144,[Dalek laboratory]
145,
146,SEC: Establish visual contact. 
147,(The view from Dalek 3's eyestalk comes up on a holo-screen.) 
148,SEC: Commence the attack. 
149,[Hooverville]
150,
151,MARTHA: There's more than one of them. 
152,"(A second Dalek swoops in and they start firing, blowing up the tents"
153,and anyone hiding there.) 
154,DALEK 3: The humans will surrender. 
155,[Dalek laboratory]
156,
157,DOCTOR [on screen]: Leave them alone. They've done
158,nothing to you! 
159,DALEK 3: We have located the Doctor. 
160,(Oops. It is in two places at once. Naughty continuity.) 
161,[Hooverville]
162,
163,(Solomon steps forward.) 
164,"DOCTOR: No, Solomon. Stay back. "
165,SOLOMON: I'm told that I'm addressing the Daleks. Is that right? 
166,[Dalek laboratory]
167,
168,SEC: Observe humanity. For all their faults they
169,have such courage. 
170,[Hooverville]
171,
172,"SOLOMON: From what I hear, you're outcasts too. "
173,"DOCTOR: Solomon, don't! "
174,"SOLOMON: Doctor, this is my township. "
175,[Dalek laboratory]
176,
177,SOLOMON [on screen]: You will respect my authority.
178,
179,[Hooverville]
180,
181,"SOLOMON: Just let me try. Daleks, ain't we all the"
182,same? 
183,[Dalek laboratory]
184,
185,"SOLOMON [on screen]: Underneath, ain't we all kin? "
186,[Hooverville]
187,
188,(Solomon puts down his rifle.) 
189,"SOLOMON: Right. See, I've just discovered this past day, God's universe"
190,is a thousand times the size I thought it was. And that scares me. Oh
191,"yeah, terrifies me right down to the bone. But surely it's got to give"
192,me hope.
193,"Hope that maybe together we can make a better tomorrow. So, I beg you"
194,"now, if you have any compassion in your hearts, then you'll meet with"
195,us and stop this fight. Well? What do you say? 
196,DALEK 3: Exterminate. 
197,(Solomon dies screaming in a burst of green energy. Sec gasps at the
198,"sight of Solomon's pain, and the Dalek in the lab looks at him.) "
199,FRANK: No! Solomon! 
200,MARTHA: They killed him. They just shot him on the spot. 
201,"DOCTOR: Daleks. All right, so it's my turn! Then kill me! Kill me if"
202,it'll stop you attacking these people! 
203,DALEK 3: I will be the destroyer of our greatest enemy. 
204,DOCTOR: Then do it! Do it! Just do it! Do it! 
205,DALEK 3: Exterminate. 
206,[Dalek laboratory]
207,
208,SEC: Stop! I command you. Stop. 
209,[Hooverville]
210,
211,DALEK 3: I do not understand. It is the Doctor. 
212,[Dalek laboratory]
213,
214,SEC: But I want him alive. 
215,[Hooverville]
216,
217,DALEK 3: The urge to kill is too strong. 
218,[Dalek laboratory]
219,
220,SEC: I have decided. The Doctor must live and you
221,will obey me. 
222,[Hooverville]
223,
224,DALEK 3: I obey. 
225,DOCTOR: What's going on? 
226,[Dalek laboratory]
227,
228,SEC: Bring him to me. 
229,[Hooverville]
230,
231,DALEK: You will follow. 
232,MARTHA: No! You can't go. 
233,DOCTOR: I've got to go. The Daleks just changed their minds. Daleks
234,never change their minds. 
235,MARTHA: But what about us? 
236,"DOCTOR: One condition! If I come with you, you spare the lives of"
237,everyone here! Do you hear me? 
238,[Dalek laboratory]
239,
240,SEC: Obey the Doctor. 
241,[Hooverville]
242,
243,"DALEK: Humans will be spared. Doctor, follow. "
244,MARTHA: Then I'm coming with you. 
245,"DOCTOR: Martha, stay here. Do what you do best. People are hurt. You"
246,"can help them. Let me go. Oh, and can I just say, thank you very much. "
247,"(He takes her hand in his, and winks, then leaves with the Daleks. He"
248,has given her his psychic paper.) 
249,[Dalek laboratory]
250,
251,DALEK 3: You saved the Doctor. Why? 
252,SEC: He's a genius and we can use him. The future of the Daleks might
253,well depend on the Doctor. 
254,[Solomon's tent]
255,
256,(People are throwing water on the remaining burning
257,tents. Martha is wrapping a man's wrist in a bandage as Tallulah enters
258,with a pan of hot water.) 
259,MAN : Somebody help me. 
260,TALLULAH: Here you go. I got some more on the boil. 
261,MARTHA: Thanks. You'll be all right. It's just a cut. Try and keep it
262,clean. 
263,PATIENT: Thanks. 
264,(The patient leaves.) 
265,TALLULAH: So what about us? What do we do now? 
266,MARTHA: The Doctor gave me this. He must have had a reason. 
267,TALLULAH: What's that for? 
268,MARTHA: It gets you into places. Buildings and things. But where? He
269,"must want me to go somewhere but, what am I supposed to do?"
270,
271,[Dalek laboratory]
272,
273,(The Doctor is escorted in.) 
274,"DOCTOR: Those people were defenceless! You only wanted me, but no, that"
275,"wasn't enough for you. You had to start killing, because that's the"
276,only thing a Dalek's good for. 
277,SEC: The deaths were wrong. 
278,DOCTOR: I'm sorry? 
279,"SEC: That man, their leader, Solomon. He showed courage. "
280,DOCTOR: And that's good? 
281,SEC: That's excellent. 
282,DOCTOR: Is it me or are you just becoming a little bit more human? 
283,"SEC: You are the last of your kind, and now I am the first of mine. "
284,DOCTOR: What do you want me for? 
285,SEC: We tried everything to survive when we found ourselves stranded in
286,"this ignorant age. First we tried growing new Dalek embryos, but their"
287,flesh was too weak. 
288,"DOCTOR: Yeah, I found one of your experiments. Just left to die out"
289,there in the dark. 
290,SEC: It forced us to conclude what is the greatest resource of this
291,planet. Its people. 
292,(Sec throws a breaker switch and lights up the whole place. Floating
293,above them are hundreds of covered bodies on stretchers. Sec brings one
294,down for inspection.) 
295,SEC: We stole them. We stole human beings for our purpose. Look inside.
296,
297,(The Doctor uncovers a man's face.) 
298,SEC: This is the true extent of the Final Experiment. 
299,DOCTOR: Is he dead? 
300,"SEC: Near death, with his mind wiped, ready to be filled with new"
301,ideas. 
302,DOCTOR: Dalek ideas. 
303,SEC: The Human Dalek race. 
304,DOCTOR: All of these people. How many? 
305,SEC: We have caverns beyond this storing more than a thousand. 
306,DOCTOR: Is there any way to restore them? Make them human again? 
307,SEC: Everything they were has been lost. 
308,DOCTOR: So they're like shells. You've got empty human beings ready to
309,be converted. That's going to take a hell of a lot of power. This
310,planet hasn't even split the atom yet. How're you going to do it? 
311,SEC: Open the conductor plan.
312,
313,[Solomon's tent]
314,
315,"MARTHA: Wait a minute. Down in the sewers, the"
316,Daleks mentioned this energy conductor. 
317,TALLULAH: What does that mean? 
318,MARTHA: I don't know. Maybe like a lightening conductor or. Dalekanium!
319,
320,TALLULAH: Oh. 
321,MARTHA: They said the Dalekanium was in place. 
322,TALLULAH: In place where? 
323,MARTHA: Frank might know.
324,
325,[Hooverville]
326,
327,(Frank is in mourning.) 
328,MARTHA: Frank? 
329,FRANK: Hmm? 
330,"MARTHA: That Mister Diagoras, he was like some sort of fixer, yeah? Get"
331,you jobs all over town? 
332,FRANK: Yeah. He could find a profit anywhere. 
333,"MARTHA: But where, though? What sort of things? "
334,"FRANK: You name it. We're all so desperate for work, you just hoped"
335,"Diagoras would pick you for something good. Building work, that pays"
336,the best. 
337,MARTHA: But what sort of building work? 
338,FRANK: Mainly building that. 
339,(He points over his shoulder to the Empire State Building.)
340,
341,[Dalek laboratory]
342,
343,(Which is also on the big screen.) 
344,"DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The Empire State Building. We're right"
345,"underneath that. I worked that out already, thanks. But what, you've"
346,hijacked the whole building? 
347,SEC: We needed an energy conductor. 
348,DOCTOR: What for? 
349,SEC: I am the genetic template. My altered DNA was to be administered
350,to each human body. A strong enough blast of gamma radiation can splice
351,"the Dalek and human genetic codes, and waken each body from its sleep. "
352,"DOCTOR: Gamma radiation? What are you. Oh, the sun. You're using the"
353,sun. 
354,SEC: Soon the greatest solar flare for a thousand years will hit the
355,Earth. Gamma radiation will be drawn to the energy conductor and when
356,it strikes 
357,DOCTOR: The army wakes. I still don't know what you need me for. 
358,"SEC: Your genius. Consider a pure Dalek, intelligent but emotionless. "
359,DOCTOR: Removing the emotions makes you stronger. That's what your
360,"creator thought, all those years ago. "
361,SEC: He was wrong. 
362,DOCTOR: He was what? 
363,"SEC: It makes us lesser than our enemies. We must return to the flesh,"
364,and also the heart. 
365,DOCTOR: But you wouldn't be the supreme beings anymore. 
366,SEC: And that is good. 
367,DALEK 2: That is incorrect. 
368,DALEK 3: Daleks are supreme. 
369,"SEC: No, not anymore. "
370,DALEK 3: But that is our purpose. 
371,SEC: Then our purpose is wrong. Where has our quest for supremacy led
372,"us? To this. Hiding in the sewers on a primitive world, just four of us"
373,left. If we do not change now then we deserve extinction. 
374,DOCTOR: So you want to change everything that makes a Dalek a Dalek. 
375,SEC: If you can help me.
376,
377,[Service lift]
378,
379,MARTHA: I always wanted to go to the Empire State.
380,"Never imagined it quite like this, though. "
381,FRANK: Where are we headed anyway? 
382,"MARTHA: The top, where they're still building. "
383,TALLULAH: How come those guys just let us through? How's that thing
384,work? 
385,MARTHA: Psychic paper. Shows them whatever I want them to think.
386,"According to this, we're two engineers and an architect."
387,
388,[Dalek laboratory]
389,
390,SEC: Your knowledge of genetic engineering is even
391,greater than ours. The new race must be ready by the time the solar
392,flare erupts. 
393,DOCTOR: But you're the template. I thought they were getting a dose of
394,you. 
395,SEC: I want to change the gene sequence. 
396,DOCTOR: To make them even more human? 
397,SEC: Humans are the great survivors. We need that ability. 
398,DOCTOR: Hold on a minute. There's no way this lot are going to let you
399,do it. 
400,SEC: I am their leader. 
401,"DOCTOR: Oh, and that's enough for you, is it? "
402,DALEK 2: Daleks must follow orders. 
403,"DALEK 1: Dalek Sec commands, we obey. "
404,"SEC: If you don't help me, nothing will change. "
405,DOCTOR: There's no room on Earth for another race of people. 
406,SEC: You have your Tardis. Take us across the stars. Find us a new home
407,and allow the new Daleks to start again. 
408,DOCTOR: When's that solar flare? 
409,SEC: Eleven minutes. 
410,DOCTOR: Right then. Better get to work.
411,
412,[Works office]
413,
414,TALLULAH: Look at this pace. Top of the world. 
415,(Martha goes to the drawing board with the blueprints on it.) 
416,"MARTHA: Okay, now this looks good. "
417,"FRANK: Hey, look at the date. These designs were issued today. They"
418,must've changed something last minute. 
419,MARTHA: You mean the Daleks changed something? 
420,"FRANK: Yeah, could be. "
421,"MARTHA: The ones underneath, they're from before. That means that"
422,whatever they changed must be on this top sheet but not on this one. We
423,need to check one against the other. 
424,TALLULAH: The height of this place! This is amazing. 
425,"MARTHA: Careful, we're a hundred floors up. Don't go wandering off. "
426,TALLULAH: I just want to see. 
427,(Tallulah goes to the open area and looks out towards the Chrysler
428,Building.) 
429,"TALLULAH: New York City. If aliens had to come to Earth, oh, no wonder"
430,they came here.
431,
432,[Dalek laboratory]
433,
434,"DOCTOR: There's no point in chromosomal grafting,"
435,it's too erratic. You need to split the genome and force the Dalek
436,human sequence right into the cortex. 
437,SEC: We need more chromatin solution. 
438,DALEK 1: The pig slaves have it. 
439,(The pigmen carry in a large crate. Laszlo is with them.) 
440,"DOCTOR: These pig slaves, what happens to them in the grand plan? "
441,SEC: Nothing. They're just simple beasts. Their lifespan is limited.
442,None survive beyond a few weeks. Power up the line feeds. 
443,(The Doctor whispers to Laszlo.) 
444,"DOCTOR: Laszlo, I can't undo what they've done to you, but they won't"
445,do it to anyone else. 
446,LASZLO: Do you trust him? 
447,DOCTOR: I know that one man can change the course of history. Right
448,"idea in the right place at the right time, it's all it takes. I've got"
449,to believe it's possible.
450,
451,[Works office]
452,
453,(The blueprints are spread out on the floor.
454,Tallulah comes back in. A storm is brewing.) 
455,FRANK: I'll go and keep an eye out. Make sure we're safe up here. Don't
456,want nobody butting in. 
457,(Frank leaves.) 
458,TALLULAH: There's a hell of a storm moving in. 
459,MARTHA: I wish the Doctor was here. He'd know what we're looking for. 
460,"TALLULAH: So tell me, where did you and him first hook up? "
461,"MARTHA: It was in a hospital, sort of. "
462,"TALLULAH: Of course, him being a doctor. "
463,"MARTHA: Actually, I'm a doctor. Well, kind of. "
464,TALLULAH: You're a physician? Really? 
465,"MARTHA: I was training. Still am, if I ever get back home. "
466,"TALLULAH: You could be doctors together. Oh, what a partnership. Oh,"
467,it's such a shame. If only he wasn't so different. You know what I
468,mean? 
469,"MARTHA: Oh, you have no idea how different he really is. "
470,"TALLULAH: Yeah, he's a man, sweetheart. That's different enough. "
471,MARTHA: He had this companion a while back. This friend. And ever since
472,"then he's been on his own. But you know, sometimes I say something or"
473,"do something and he looks at me, and I just sort of think that he's not"
474,seeing me. He's just remembering. 
475,"TALLULAH: Oh. Listen, sweetheart. You want to get all sad? You want to"
476,have a contest with me and Laszlo? 
477,"MARTHA: No. But listen, if the Doctor's with Laszlo now, there's every"
478,chance that he could get him out. 
479,TALLULAH: And then what? Don't talk crazy. There's no future for me and
480,him. Those Dalek things took that away. The one good thing I had in my
481,life and they destroyed it.
482,
483,[Dalek laboratory]
484,
485,DALEK 1: The line feeds are ready. 
486,DOCTOR: Then it's all systems go. 
487,SEC: The solar flare is imminent. The radiation will reach Earth in a
488,matter of minutes. 
489,DOCTOR: We'll be ready for it. 
490,(The Doctor fills a large syringe with blue liquid and puts it into a
491,brass still.) 
492,DOCTOR: That compound will allow the gene bonds to reconfigure in a
493,brand new pattern. Power up! 
494,"(A pigman throws one set of breakers, and Laszlo throws the other.) "
495,SEC: Start the line feeds. 
496,(The liquid goes up plastic tubes to all the bodies hanging above them.
497,It has got lots of bubbles in it.) 
498,DOCTOR: There goes the gene solution. 
499,SEC: The life blood.
500,
501,[Works office]
502,
503,"MARTHA: Gotcha. Look. There, on the mast. Those"
504,"little lines? They're new. They've added something, see? "
505,TALLULAH: Added what? 
506,BOTH: Dalekanium!
507,
508,[Dalek laboratory]
509,
510,(A klaxon sounds.) 
511,DOCTOR: What's that? 
512,SEC: What's happening? Is there a malfunction? Answer me! 
513,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. The gene feed! They're overriding the gene feed! "
514,SEC: Impossible. They cannot disobey orders. 
515,DALEK 1: The Doctor will step away from the controls. 
516,SEC: Stop! You will not fire. 
517,DALEK 3: He is an enemy of the Daleks. 
518,DALEK 1: And so are you. 
519,(The Daleks point their guns at Sec.) 
520,SEC: I am your commander. I am Dalek Sec. 
521,DALEK 1: You have lost your authority. 
522,DALEK 3: You are no longer a Dalek. 
523,DOCTOR: What have you done with the gene feed? 
524,DALEK 1: The new bodies will be one hundred percent Dalek. 
525,SEC: No. You can't do this! 
526,"DALEK 3: Pig slaves, restrain Dalek Sec and the Doctor. "
527,(Laszlo is one of those that grab the Doctor.) 
528,SEC: Release me. I created you. I am your master. 
529,(Another alarm sounds. The lift is coming down.) 
530,DALEK 1: Solar flare approaching. 
531,DALEK 3: Prepare to intercept. 
532,LASZLO: There's the lift. 
533,DOCTOR: After you. 
534,(Laszlo and the Doctor run. The Doctor uses the sonic screwdriver to
535,get the lift doors open.) 
536,DALEK 1: The Doctor is escaping. Stop him! Stop him! 
537,(The doors slam shut in the pigmen's faces.)
538,
539,[Lift]
540,
541,DOCTOR: We've only got minutes before the gamma
542,radiation reaches the Earth. We need to get to the top of the building.
543,"Laszlo, what's wrong? "
544,"LASZLO: Out of breath. It's nothing. We've escaped them, Doctor. That's"
545,all that matters. 
546,[Dalek laboratory]
547,
548,(Pitmen push Sec to his knees before the rest of
549,the Cult of Skaro.) 
550,SEC: You have betrayed me. 
551,DALEK 1: You told us to imagine. 
552,DALEK 3: And we imagined your irrelevance. 
553,SEC: I was your leader. I am Dalek Sec. Obey me!
554,
555,[Works office]
556,
557,(The lift arrives.) 
558,MARTHA: Doctor! 
559,"DOCTOR: First floor, perfumery. "
560,TALLULAH: I never thought I'd see you again. 
561,LASZLO: No stopping me. 
562,(Tallulah and Laszlo hug.) 
563,MARTHA: We've worked it out. We know what they've done. There's
564,"Dalekanium on the mast. And it's good to see you too, by thy way. "
565,"DOCTOR: Oh, come here. "
566,(The Doctor sweeps Martha off her feet. Then the lift doors shut.) 
567,"DOCTOR: No, no, no. See, never waste time with a hug. Deadlock seal. I"
568,can't stop it. 
569,MARTHA: Where's it going? 
570,DOCTOR: Right down to the Daleks. And they're not going to leave us
571,alone up here. What's the time? 
572,"FRANK: Er, eleven fifteen. "
573,DOCTOR: Six minutes to go. I've got to remove the Dalekanium before the
574,gamma radiation hits. 
575,TALLULAH: Gammon radiation? What the heck is that? 
576,(They run to the open area and look out.) 
577,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's high. That's very. Blimey, that's high. "
578,"MARTHA: And we've got to go even higher. That's the mast up there,"
579,look. There's three pieces of Dalekanium on the base. We've got to get
580,them off. 
581,(The Doctor and Martha look up the wooden ladder leading to the base of
582,the mast.) 
583,"DOCTOR: That's not we, that's just me. "
584,MARTHA: I won't just stand here and watch you. 
585,"DOCTOR: No, you're going to have your hands full anyway. I'm sorry,"
586,"Martha, but you've got to fight."
587,
588,[Dalek laboratory]
589,
590,(Sec has been chained to a wall.) 
591,DALEK 3: Confirm time until solar intercept. 
592,DALEK 1: Gamma strike four minutes and counting. 
593,(The Doctor makes his way up the scaffolding and ironwork to the mast.
594,He uses his sonic screwdriver to unfasten the Dalek panels from the
595,lightning conductor.) 
596,DALEK 1: Pig slaves will take the lift. Find the Doctor. Kill him.
597,
598,[Works office]
599,
600,MARTHA: The lift's coming up. 
601,FRANK: I should have brought that gun. 
602,"LASZLO: Tallulah, stay back. You too, Martha. If they send pig slaves,"
603,they're trained to kill. 
604,MARTHA: The Doctor needs me to fight. I'm not going anywhere! 
605,LASZLO: They're savages. I should know. They're trained to slit your
606,throat with their bare teeth. 
607,"(But Laszlo can barely lift his lump hammer, and falls.) "
608,TALLULAH: Laszlo? What is it? 
609,"LASZLO: No, it's nothing. I'm fine. Just leave me. "
610,"TALLULAH: Oh, honey, you're burning up. What's wrong with you? Tell me."
611,
612,"FRANK: Great. One man down, we ain't even started yet. "
613,"MARTHA: It's not looking good, Frank. "
614,FRANK: Nope. 
615,MARTHA: We're going to get slaughtered. 
616,(Thunder and lightning over the city.) 
617,MARTHA: Wait a minute. Lightening. 
618,(The Doctor gets the first panel off the mast. Frank and Martha get
619,sections of metal scaffolding and use chairs to trail them in from
620,outside.) 
621,"TALLULAH: Aw, you'll be all right, sweetheart. Don't you worry. What"
622,the hell are you two clowns
623,doing? 
624,"MARTHA: Even if the Doctor stops the Dalekanium, this place is still"
625,"going to get hit. Great big bolt of lightening, electricity all down"
626,this building. Connect this to the lift and they get zapped. 
627,"TALLULAH: Oh my God, that could work. "
628,FRANK: Then give us a hand.
629,
630,[Dalek laboratory]
631,
632,DALEK 1: Gamma strike imminent. In forty rels.
633,"Thirty nine, thirty eight, thirty seven "
634,(The Doctor drops his sonic screwdriver.)
635,
636,[Works office]
637,
638,(Martha has set up a line of metal from the
639,lightning conductor to the lift doors.) 
640,TALLULAH: Is that going to work? 
641,MARTHA: It's got to. 
642,FRANK: I've got it all piped up to the scaffolding outside. 
643,"MARTHA: Come here, Frank. Just sit in the middle and don't touch"
644,anything metal. 
645,FRANK: Yeah.
646,
647,[Dalek laboratory]
648,
649,"DALEK 1: Twelve, eleven, ten "
650,(The Doctor gives up trying to pull the Dalek panel off and looks at
651,the top of the mast. The lift reaches floor 90. He climbs onto the mast
652,and hold on. The lift arrives.) 
653,DALEK 1: Zero. Gamma strike! 
654,"(The lightning hits the top of the mast and lights up the Doctor, who"
655,"screams. The electricity flows down the conductor, along the"
656,scaffolding poles and straight into the pigmen in the lift. The rest of
657,it arcs down the outside of the building and into the laboratory.) 
658,DALEK 1: The army awakes. 
659,(The stretchers are all lowered and the people push their shrouds
660,aside.)
661,
662,[Works office]
663,
664,(The pigmen are all dead.) 
665,"TALLULAH: You did it, Martha. "
666,"MARTHA: They used to be like Laszlo. They were people, and I killed"
667,them. 
668,"LASZLO: No, the Daleks killed them. Long ago. "
669,MARTHA: What about the Doctor? 
670,"(The Doctor is lying by the mast, very still.)"
671,
672,[Dalek laboratory]
673,
674,(The people are all lined up in front of the
675,Daleks.) 
676,DALEK 1: You will identify. 
677,FOREMAN: I am a Dalek. 
678,DALEK 1: Excellent. 
679,DALEK 3: Begin the invasion of Manhattan. The population will be
680,converted to Daleks. 
681,DALEK 1: And from this island we will conquer the world. 
682,DALEK 3: Assume battle positions. Take arms. 
683,"(The people turn left, start marching on the spot then move out to a"
684,rack where they each collect a Dalek weapon.)
685,
686,[Lightning conductor]
687,
688,MARTHA: Doctor! Doctor? Look what we found halfway
689,down. 
690,(The sonic screwdriver.) 
691,MARTHA: You're getting careless. 
692,DOCTOR: Oh my head. 
693,MARTHA: Hiya. 
694,"DOCTOR: Hi. You survived, then. "
695,"MARTHA: So did you, just about. I can't help noticing there's"
696,Dalekanium still attached. 
697,(The mutated people march through the sewers.)
698,
699,[Dalek laboratory]
700,
701,DALEK 1: War demands strategy. I am designated
702,controller. 
703,SEC: That was to be my position. 
704,DALEKS: You are unfit. 
705,DALEK 1: Connect me to the military computer. I will coordinate all
706,units.
707,
708,[Works office]
709,
710,DOCTOR: The Daleks will have gone straight to a war
711,"footing. They'll be using the sewers, spreading the soldiers out"
712,underneath Manhattan. 
713,LASZLO: How do we stop them? 
714,DOCTOR: There's only one chance. I got in the way. That gamma strike
715,went zapping though me first. 
716,"MARTHA: Yeah, but what does that mean? "
717,"DOCTOR: We need to draw fire. Before they can attack New York, I need"
718,"to face them. Where can I draw them out? Think, think, think, think,"
719,think. We need some sort of space. Somewhere safe. Somewhere out of the
720,way. Tallulah! 
721,TALLULAH: That's me. Three Ls and an H. 
722,"DOCTOR: The theatre! It's right above them, and, what, it's gone"
723,midnight? Can you get us inside? 
724,TALLULAH: Don't see why not. 
725,DOCTOR: Is there another lift? 
726,MARTHA: We came up in the service elevator. 
727,DOCTOR: That'll do. Allons-y!
728,
729,[Dalek laboratory]
730,
731,(Dalek 1 is linked into the computer by lots of
732,cables.) 
733,DALEK 3: Report status. 
734,DALEK 1: Maximum efficiency. I am now ready for full scale war. 
735,DALEK 3: Control over Dalek humans? 
736,DALEK 1: Connection confirmed. All soldiers will take heed. All weapons
737,will be primed. 
738,"(The people stop, and lock and load the guns.)"
739,
740,[Theatre]
741,
742,(In the stalls.) 
743,DOCTOR: This should do it. Here we go. 
744,TALLULAH: There ain't nothing more creepy than a theatre in the dark.
745,"Listen, Doctor, I know you got a thing for"
746,"show tunes, but there's a time and place, huh? "
747,(Laszlo sits down.) 
748,"TALLULAH: Laszlo, what's wrong? "
749,LASZLO: Nothing. It's just so hot. 
750,"TALLULAH: But it's freezing in here. Doctor, what's happening to him? "
751,"DOCTOR: Not now, Tallulah. Sorry. "
752,MARTHA: What are you doing? 
753,"DOCTOR: If the Daleks are going to war, they'll want to find their"
754,number one enemy. I'm just telling them where I am. 
755,"(He holds his sonic screwdriver in the air, beeping.) "
756,[Dalek laboratory]
757,
758,DALEK 1: Sonic device detected! 
759,DALEK 3: The Doctor survived? 
760,DALEK 2: Find him and exterminate!
761,
762,[Theatre]
763,
764,DOCTOR: I'm telling you to go. Frank can take you
765,back to Hooverville. 
766,MARTHA: And I'm telling you I'm not going. 
767,"DOCTOR: Martha, that's an order. "
768,"MARTHA: Who are you, then? Some sort of Dalek? "
769,(The doors are broken down and the people march in from both sides.) 
770,"TALLULAH: Doctor! Oh, my God! Well, I guess that's them then, huh? "
771,"MARTHA: Humans, with Dalek DNA? "
772,"DOCTOR: It's all right, it's all right. Just stay calm. Don't"
773,antagonize them. 
774,LASZLO: But what of the Dalek masters? Where are they? 
775,[Dalek laboratory]
776,
777,DALEK 1: Doctor located. Advance. Advance. 
778,[Theatre]
779,
780,(There is an explosion on stage. The two Daleks
781,"appear, with Sec on a chain and crawling on his hands and knees, like a"
782,dog.) 
783,DALEK 3: The Doctor will stand before the Daleks. 
784,(The Doctor walks forward over the top of the seats.) 
785,"DALEK 3: You will die, Doctor. It is the beginning of a new age. "
786,DALEK 2: Planet Earth will become New Skaro. 
787,"DOCTOR: Oh, and what a world. With anything just the slightest bit"
788,different ground into the dirt. That's Dalek Sec. Don't you remember?
789,The cleverest Dalek ever and look what you've done to him. Is that your
790,"new Empire, hmm? Is that the foundation for a whole new civilization? "
791,"SEC: My Daleks, just understand this. If you choose death and"
792,"destruction, then death and destruction will choose you. "
793,DALEK 3: Incorrect. We will always survive. 
794,"DALEK 2: Now we will destroy our greatest enemy, the Doctor. "
795,SEC: But he can help you. 
796,DALEK 3: The Doctor must die. 
797,"SEC: No, I beg you, don't. "
798,DALEK 3: Exterminate! 
799,(Sec stands in front of the Dalek just as it fires. Sec dies.) 
800,DOCTOR: Your own leader. The only creature who might have led you out
801,of the darkness and you destroyed him. Do you see what they did? Huh?
802,You see what a Dalek really is? 
803,[Dalek laboratory]
804,
805,DALEK 1: Warning. Dalek humans show increased
806,levels of serotonin. 
807,[Theatre]
808,
809,"DOCTOR: If I'm going to die, let's give the new"
810,"boys a shot. What do you think, eh? The"
811,"Dalek humans. Their first blood. Go on, baptise them. "
812,"DALEK 3: Dalek humans, take aim. "
813,(They do.) 
814,DOCTOR: What are you waiting for? Give the command! 
815,DALEK 3: Exterminate! 
816,"(The Doctor tenses, but nothing happens.) "
817,DALEK 2: Exterminate! 
818,DALEK 3: Obey. Dalek humans will obey. 
819,MARTHA: They're not firing. What have you done? 
820,DALEK 3: You will obey. Exterminate. 
821,FOREMAN: Why? 
822,DALEK 2: Daleks do not question orders. 
823,FOREMAN: But why? 
824,DALEK 2: You will stop this. 
825,FOREMAN: But why? 
826,DALEK 2: You must not question. 
827,"FOREMAN: But you are not our master. And we, we are not Daleks. "
828,"DOCTOR: No, you're not. And you never will be. Sorry, I got in the way"
829,of the lightning strike. Time Lord DNA got all mixed up. Just that
830,little bit of freedom. 
831,"DALEK 3: If they will not obey, then they must die. "
832,(The Dalek shoots the foreman.) 
833,DOCTOR: Get down! 
834,(Everyone drops below the seats as the Daleks and their mutated humans
835,fire at each other.) 
836,DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! 
837,[Dalek laboratory]
838,
839,DALEK 1: Destroy the hybrids. Destroy. 
840,DALEKS: Exterminate! 
841,(A Dalek is destroyed.) 
842,DALEK: Extermin 
843,(And the other gets its head blown up. The group stand up.) 
844,"DOCTOR: It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. You did it."
845,You're free. 
846,[Dalek laboratory]
847,
848,DALEK 1: The Dalek humans are failures. Destruct!
849,Destruct! Destruct! 
850,(There is a high-pitched sound. The mutants clutch their heads then
851,die.) 
852,DOCTOR: No! They can't! They can't! They can't! They can't! 
853,MARTHA: What happened? What was that? 
854,"DOCTOR: They killed them, rather than let them live. An entire species."
855,Genocide. 
856,LASZLO: Only two of the Daleks have been destroyed. One of the Dalek
857,masters must still be alive. 
858,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. In the whole universe, just one."
859,
860,[Dalek laboratory]
861,
862,DOCTOR: Now what? 
863,DALEK: You will be exterminated. 
864,"DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just think about it, Dalek what was"
865,your name? 
866,DALEK: Dalek Caan. 
867,DOCTOR: Dalek Caan. Your entire species has been wiped out. And now the
868,"Cult of Skaro has been eradicated, leaving only you. Right now you're"
869,facing the only man in the universe who might show you some compassion.
870,"Because I've just seen one genocide. I won't cause another. Caan, let"
871,me help you. What do you say? 
872,DALEK: Emergency temporal shift! 
873,(The cables fall off and the Dalek disappears.) 
874,MARTHA: Doctor! Doctor! He's sick. 
875,(Tallulah and Martha help the wheezing Laszlo.) 
876,MARTHA: It's okay. You're all right. It's his heart. It's racing like
877,mad. I've never seen anything like it. 
878,"TALLULAH: What is it, Doctor? What's the matter with him? He says he"
879,can't breathe? What is it? 
880,"LASZLO: It's time, sweetheart. "
881,"TALLULAH: What do you mean, time? What are you talking about? "
882,LASZLO: None of the slaves survive for long. Most of them only live for
883,"a few weeks. I was lucky. I held on because I had you. But now, I'm"
884,"dying, Tallulah. "
885,"TALLULAH: No, you're not. Not now, after all this. Doctor, can't you do"
886,something? 
887,"DOCTOR: Oh, Tallulah with three Ls and an H, just you watch me. What do"
888,"I need? Oh, I don't know. How about a great big genetic laboratory? Oh"
889,"look, I've got one. Laszlo, just you hold on. There's been too many"
890,deaths today. 
891,(The Doctor starts working with coloured liquids.) 
892,DOCTOR: Way too many people have died. Brand new creatures and wise old
893,"men and age old enemies. And I'm telling you, I'm telling you right"
894,"now, I am not having one more death! You got that? Not one. Tallulah,"
895,out of the way. The Doctor is in.
896,
897,[Central Park]
898,
899,"FRANK: Well, I talked to them, and I told them what"
900,"Solomon would've said, and I reckon I shamed one or two of them. "
901,DOCTOR: What did they say? 
902,"FRANK: They said yes. They'll give you a home, Laszlo. I mean, er,"
903,don't imagine people ain't
904,"going to stare. I can't promise you'll be at peace but, in the end,"
905,that is what Hooverville is for. People who ain't got nowhere else. 
906,LASZLO: Thank you. I can't thank you enough.
907,
908,[Bedloe's Island]
909,
910,"MARTHA: Do you reckon it's going to work, those"
911,two? 
912,"DOCTOR: I don't know. Anywhere else in the universe, I might worry"
913,"about them, but New York? That's what this city's good at. Give me your"
914,"tired, your poor, your huddled masses, and maybe the odd pig slave"
915,Dalek mutant hybrid too. 
916,MARTHA: The pig and the showgirl. 
917,DOCTOR: The pig and the showgirl. 
918,"MARTHA: It just proves it, I suppose. There's someone for everyone. "
919,DOCTOR: Maybe. 
920,"MARTHA: Meant to say, I'm sorry. "
921,DOCTOR: What for? 
922,MARTHA: Just because that Dalek got away. I know what that means to
923,you. Think you'll ever see it again? 
924,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. One day.  "
