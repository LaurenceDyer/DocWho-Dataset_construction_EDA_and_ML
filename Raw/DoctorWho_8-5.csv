21,One 
22, [Village Green] 
23, (It is a dark and stormy night. The quiet village
24,"of Aldbourne in Wiltshire pretends to be Devil's End, with an"
25,appropriate eerie howling wind and thunderstorm. Lightning
26,briefly  illuminates the church across the green as the public
27,"house, the Cloven Hoof, turns out its last customers - a man and his"
28,dog - into the storm.) 
29,"JIM: Goodnight, Frank. "
30,"FRANK : Goodnight, Jim. "
31,"(By the churchyard, the dog gets free of his master and runs through"
32,"the gravestones, barking. Jim follows, and we hear a strange noise as a"
33,look of terror comes over his face.) 
34, [Street]
35,
36, (Next morning is dry and clear. The local
37,eccentric spinster is walking along with the local doctor.) 
38,"HAWTHORNE: He died of fright, Doctor. "
39,REEVES: My dear Miss Hawthorne 
40,HAWTHORNE: I don't care what you say. The man died of fright! 
41,"REEVES: My dear Miss Hawthorne, the medical diagnosis was quite clear."
42,He died of a heart attack. 
43,HAWTHORNE: But his face? 
44,"REEVES: Slight protrusion of the eyeballs, rictus drawing of the lips"
45,back over the teeth. Common enough in heart failure. 
46,HAWTHORNE: The signs are there for all to see! I cast the runes only
47,this morning. 
48,REEVES You'll have to excuse me. I have my rounds to do. 
49,(Doctor Reeves gets into his car.) 
50,"HAWTHORNE: If Professor Horner opens up that barrow, he will bring"
51,disaster on us all! 
52,(Reeves drives away.) 
53,HAWTHORNE: This is just the beginning!
54,
55, [Barrow]
56,
57, (Cameras are being set up at the archeological
58,dig.) 
59,"TECHNICIAN: A bit more, David. "
60,FERGUS: Professor Horner? 
61,TECHNICIAN: That's it. 
62,"FERGUS: Now where's he got to, for pete's sake? "
63,(Alastair goes to the tunnel entrance to the bowels of the ancient
64,burial mound.) 
65,FERGUS: Harry? 
66,"HARRY: Hello, Alastair. What's up? "
67,FERGUS: Where's Professor Horner? 
68,"HARRY: Probably in make up, unless he's had second thoughts and"
69,scarpered. 
70,FERGUS: What? 
71,"HARRY: Well, you know the local chat. Death and disaster if he opens"
72,the barrow. 
73,"FERGUS: Well, there'll be a disaster if he doesn't get a shift on. "
74,"HARRY: Okay, okay, I'll chase him up."
75,
76, [UNIT HQ Garage]
77,
78, (The Doctor is working on Bessie's engine.) 
79,JO: But it really is the dawning of the age of Aquarius. 
80,DOCTOR: So? 
81,"JO: Well, that means the occult. Well, you know, the supernatural and"
82,all that magic bit. 
83,"DOCTOR: You know, really, Jo, I'm obviously wasting my time trying to"
84,turn you into a scientist. 
85,"JO: Well, how do you know there's nothing in it? "
86,"DOCTOR: How? Well, I just know, that's all. Everything that happens in"
87,life must have a scientific explanation. If you know where to look for
88,"it, that is. Excuse me. "
89,"JO: Yes, but suppose something was to happen and nobody knew the"
90,"explanation. Well, nobody in the world, in the universe. Well, that"
91,"would be magic, wouldn't it? "
92,"DOCTOR: You know, Jo, for a reasonably intelligent young lady, you do"
93,have the most absurd ideas. 
94,(Bessie starts up and drives off.) 
95,"JO: Doctor, look! "
96,(Bessie goes for an independent spin around the yard before driving
97,back into the garage.) 
98,"DOCTOR: Bessie, how dare you go gallivanting around like that. "
99,(Parp.) 
100,DOCTOR: Are you sorry? 
101,"(Parp, parp, honks Bessie.) "
102,"DOCTOR: Very well, I forgive you. Now go back to your parking place"
103,before I change my mind. 
104,(Bessie reverses out of the garage.) 
105,YATES: I know there's a good explanation for all this but I just can't
106,think of it for the moment. 
107,DOCTOR: Would you believe magic? 
108,YATES: Magic? 
109,DOCTOR: Hmm. 
110,YATES: No! 
111,"DOCTOR: Well, Jo would. "
112,JO: That's not fair. 
113,"DOCTOR: Well, you explain it then. "
114,JO: I don't know. I suppose you did it. 
115,DOCTOR: Naturally. Or should I say scientifically. Solenoids and a
116,solar mechanism in Bessie and 
117,(The Doctor takes a hand-sized box out of his overall pocket.) 
118,DOCTOR: A radio control unit here. You see how easy it is to be a
119,magician? 
120,"JO: How infuriating can you get. Well, it doesn't prove anything. "
121,DOCTOR: Would you like me to show you some more then? 
122,"JO: No thanks, I've had enough of your knavish tricks. Anyway, I want"
123,"to see that TV programme. Mike, would you give me a lift? "
124,YATES: Sure. 
125,JO: Thanks. 
126,"YATES: You coming, Doctor? "
127,DOCTOR: Coming where? 
128,"YATES: Well, to see that programme. "
129,"DOCTOR: Oh, not you too, Captain Yates? "
130,"YATES: Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world. Very exciting. Forecasts"
131,of doom and disaster if anyone disturbs the burial chamber. 
132,"DOCTOR: Captain Yates, you astound me. "
133,"YATES: Well, you never know. Devil's End has a funny reputation. "
134,DOCTOR: What did you say? 
135,YATES: Devil's End. The village near the dig. 
136,DOCTOR: Devil's End? Devil's End? 
137,"YATES: Doctor, are you all right? "
138,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I'm fine."
139,
140, [UNIT yard]
141,
142, YATES: Now where are you going? 
143,"DOCTOR: To see that TV programme, of course. "
144,(The Doctor gets into Bessie.)
145,
146, [Church cavern]
147,
148," (The broadcast is getting underway, and Time Team"
149,"it ain't. Alastair Fergus is speaking direct to camera, his voice"
150,echoing eerily in the dark undercroft.) 
151,FERGUS: Devil's End. The very name sends a shiver up the spine. The
152,"witches of Devil's End, the famous curse, the notorious cavern"
153,underneath the church where the third Lord of Aldbourne played at his
154,eighteen century parody of black magic. Devil's End is part of the dark
155,"mythology of our childhood days. And now, for the first time, the"
156,cameras of the BBC have been allowed inside the cavern itself. In this
157,"cavern, pagan man performed his unspeakable rites. In this cavern, the"
158,witches of the seventeenth century hid from the fires of Matthew
159,"Hopkins, witch-hunter extraordinary. In this cavern. But I could go on"
160,all day. 
161,(Fergus goes past a tableau of devil worship to a cross-legged
162,"gargoyle, its chin resting on its hands.) "
163,FERGUS: There is something strange about Devil's End. Is Professor
164,"Horner being as foolish as his critics would suggest? I must admit,"
165,"standing here in this unquiet place, I'm beginning to wonder myself."
166,
167, [Barrow]
168,
169, HARRY: Quiet please! 
170,"(And cues Fergus, standing outside the tunnel entrance.) "
171,"FERGUS: While I was recording that earlier this afternoon, the"
172,archaeological dig was proceeding apace. Professor Horner and his team
173,"have cut their way into the Devil's Hump, as this barrow is called by"
174,"the locals, as if it were a giant pie. But now the question is can"
175,Professor Horner pull out his plum. 
176,"HORNER: Get on with it, man. "
177,FERGUS: Or will the Professor be proved disastrously wrong?
178,
179, [UNIT HQ. room]
180,
181,"(Bunk beds, table, telephone, drinks machine, a"
182,television. Benton is watching TV.) 
183,"FERGUS [on TV]: For some two hundred years, the controversy has raged."
184,"What is the Devil's Hump. Now, we're not the first to try and find out."
185,"But from 1793, when Sir Percival Flint's miners ran back to Cornwall"
186,leaving him for dead to the famous Cambridge University fiasco of 1939 
187,"(Jo, the Doctor and Yates enter.) "
188,JO: Has it started yet? 
189,BENTON: Shush. 
190,DOCTOR: Let's see what he has to say. 
191,"FERGUS [on TV]: Has remained an enigma. But tonight, the enigma will be"
192,solved. 
193, [Barrow]
194,
195," FERGUS: Tonight, at midnight, the witching hour,"
196,viewers of BBC3 will have the privilege of being present when Professor
197,"Gilbert Horner, the noted archeologist "
198,"HORNER: Got round to me at last, have you? About time too. "
199,"FERGUS: Not yet, Professor, not yet. "
200,"HORNER: Hey you, bring that camera over here, would you? Come on!"
201,
202, [Barrow entrance]
203,
204, (Horner leads Fergus and the cameraman down the
205,tunnel to a large stone blocking their way.) 
206,"HORNER: There, that's the spot. Six inches behind there lies the"
207,greatest archaeological find this country has known since Sutton Hoo. 
208,"FERGUS: Would you like to explain that reference, Professor? "
209,HORNER: No. And at midnight tonight 
210,"FERGUS: Sutton Hoo, of course "
211,HORNER: Never mind about Sutton Hoo. This is what your precious viewers
212,"are interested in. The Devil's Hump and what's inside it, right? "
213,FERGUS: And what is inside it? 
214,"HORNER: Treasure, that's what. The tomb of a great warrior chieftain,"
215,"bronze age, 800 BC. "
216,FERGUS: You're very precise? 
217,"HORNER: No need to take my word for it. See for yourself, midnight. "
218,"FERGUS: Ah yes, now then, why midnight and why tonight? "
219,"HORNER: Well, it's obvious. April 30th is Beltane, isn't it? "
220,FERGUS: Beltane? 
221,"HORNER: You know, you ought to have done your homework before you came"
222,on this dig. 
223,"FERGUS: For the viewers, Professor. "
224,"HORNER: April the 30th, Beltane, greatest occult festival of the year,"
225,bar Halloween.
226,
227, [UNIT HQ room]
228,
229," FERGUS [on TV]: Well, frankly, I'm not much wiser."
230,
231,DOCTOR: Beltane. Of course. 
232,"HORNER [on TV]: You've heard the tales about this place? The ghosts,"
233,"the witches, the curse. The famous curse. "
234,FERGUS [on TV]: You don't believe that. 
235,HORNER [on TV] Do you? 
236,"FERGUS [on TV]: Well then, why have you? "
237,HORNER [on TV]: My new book comes out tomorrow. 
238,FERGUS [on TV]: Oh. Then it's what one might call a publicity gimmick. 
239,"HORNER [on TV]: Top of the class, lad. "
240,FERGUS [on TV]: And you're not concerned about the reaction of your
241,colleagues to 
242,"DOCTOR: You know, there's something dreadfully wrong here. "
243,"JO: Hey, you really mean that, don't you? "
244,"HORNER [on TV]: Oh, they'll react the same way as always. They'll turn"
245,green. 
246,"YATES: Well, what could be wrong? "
247,"FERGUS [on TV]: But surely, if you "
248,DOCTOR: I don't know. Aquarius? The Devil's Hump? Beltane? 
249,HAWTHORNE [on TV]: I know perfectly well you're on the air. That's why
250,I'm here. 
251,"DOCTOR: Come on, think, think! "
252,"BENTON: Doctor, look. Something's going on. "
253,(The broadcast has moved back outside the barrow to fend off Miss
254,Hawthorne and her umbrella.) 
255,"HAWTHORNE [on TV]: Get your hands off me, young man! Let me go!"
256,
257, [Barrow]
258,
259," FERGUS: Okay, Harry. "
260,"HAWTHORNE: I've come here to protest, and protest I shall. "
261,"FERGUS: Now this is Miss Hawthorne, a prominent local resident who's"
262,"very much opposed to Professor Horner's dig. Professor Horner, I"
263,believe you two have already met? 
264,HORNER: I'll say. The daft woman's been pestering me for weeks. 
265,HAWTHORNE: I've been trying to make you see reason. 
266,"FERGUS: Miss Hawthorne, why are you so opposed to this dig? "
267,HAWTHORNE: Because this man is tampering with forces he does not
268,understand. 
269,"HORNER: Oh, come on now. "
270,HAWTHORNE: You'll bring destruction on yourself and upon the whole area
271,"if you persist. Death and disaster await you. Believe me, I know. "
272,FERGUS: But that's just it. Why should we believe you and how do you
273,know? 
274,HAWTHORNE: I'm a witch. 
275,HORNER: You see? I told you she was daft. 
276,"FERGUS: Miss Hawthorne, you don't really mean to say "
277,"HAWTHORNE: I tell you I'm a witch! White, of course, but that is why"
278,you should listen to me. I know! 
279,"FERGUS: Well, thank you very much, Miss Hawthorne, for a most"
280,interesting 
281,HAWTHORNE: I've cast the runes. I've consulted the talisman of Mercury.
282,"It's written in the stars. When Beltane is come, tread softly, for lo,"
283,the prince himself is nigh. And tonight is Beltane. 
284,HORNER: You see? Mad as a hatter. 
285,FERGUS: The prince? 
286,"HAWTHORNE: The Prince of Evil, the Dark One, the Horned Beast. "
287, [UNIT HQ room]
288,
289," DOCTOR: Come on, Jo. "
290,JO: Where to? 
291,"DOCTOR: Devil's End, of course. That woman is perfectly right. We've"
292,got to stop that lunatic before it's too late. 
293,(Jo and the Doctor leave. Dramatic music drowns the conversation on the
294,television until) 
295,"FERGUS [on TV]: Miss Hawthorne, Professor Horner, thank you. So "
296, [Barrow]
297,
298, FERGUS: There we are. It seems that time is
299,running out in more ways than one. What is going to happen here at
300,midnight? Why not tune in to BBC3 at 11.45 tonight and find out? Until
301,"then, from me, it's goodbye now. Alastair Fergus, The Passing Parade,"
302,Devil's End.
303,
304, [The Cloven Hoof bar]
305,
306, (The television behind the bar is switched off.) 
307,"WINSTANLEY: (old man, Squire) Good for Miss Hawthorne! She kept her end"
308,up jolly well. 
309,BERT: (mine host) The woman's round the twist if you ask me. Always has
310,been. 
311,"GIRTON: You're right, Bert. Should have been put away years ago. "
312,"WINSTANLEY: Oh, I'm not so sure she hasn't got a point. Broadly"
313,"speaking, you know. "
314,"GIRTON: What, all that stuff about death and disaster? Well, you're not"
315,"telling me you believe it, Mister Winstanley? "
316,"WINSTANLEY: Well, no, but there have been a lot of queer goings on the"
317,"last few weeks. Strange sudden noises and gusts of wind, and poor old"
318,Jim dropping down in the churchyard. 
319,"BERT: Yeah, Frank was telling me his cows have gone dry and my wife's"
320,hens have stopped laying. 
321,"WINSTANLEY: Yes, and all since they started digging up there on Devil's"
322,Hump. 
323,"BERT: Could just be a coincidence, you know. "
324,GIRTON: We've had a spell of bad weather. Always upsets things that
325,does. 
326,"WINSTANLEY: Yes, but just suppose she's right, eh? How about that,"
327,Bert? 
328,"BERT: Well, I'll tell you. if the Old'un does come along here tonight,"
329,"he can have my best room. My bread and butter, he is."
330,
331, [Street]
332,
333, (The village constable comes out of number 3 and
334,goes to his bicycle.) 
335,"GROOM: Good evening, Miss Hawthorne. Saw you on the television just"
336,now. Very good I thought you were. 
337,"HAWTHORNE: They chopped me, cut me off. Don't you worry, Constable."
338,I'll get my chance later tonight. You'll see. 
339,"(A sudden strong wind blasts down the street, nearly blowing them off"
340,their feet.) 
341,"HAWTHORNE: Avaunt, all ye elementals! "
342,(Groom picks up a large rock from his garden.) 
343,HAWTHORNE: Avaunt all ye powers of adversity! 
344,(Groom walks up behind Hawthorne with the rock.) 
345,HAWTHORNE: Be still and return to thy resting. 
346,(The wind dies down and Groom lowers the rock.) 
347,"HAWTHORNE: Be at peace in thy sleeping. Mister Groom? Mister Groom, are"
348,you all right? 
349,"GROOM: Yes, I think so. I just felt a bit faint for a moment or two. "
350,"HAWTHORNE: I'm not at all surprised. Not at all. It'll pass, Mister"
351,"Groom, it'll pass. "
352,"GROOM: I'm feeling a lot better now already, thank you. "
353,"HAWTHORNE: We must be on our guard, all of us. "
354,"(Hawthorne walks off, Groom looks down at the rock he is holding."
355,"Meanwhile, the Doctor and Jo are driving down a country road in Bessie."
356,The strong wind grabs a four-finger sign post at a junction and spins
357,"it around, sending them straight on instead of right to Devils End.)"
358,
359, [Churchyard]
360,
361, (Miss Hawthorne walks through and along the wall
362,towards the vicarage. The verger suddenly appears in front of her.) 
363,HAWTHORNE: Oh! 
364,GARVIN: What do you want? 
365,"HAWTHORNE: How dare you jump out at me like that. Out of my way,"
366,please. 
367,GARVIN: What do you want? 
368,"HAWTHORNE: Well, if you must know, I wish to contact the vicar. "
369,GARVIN: Mister Magister's not in at the moment. 
370,HAWTHORNE: Not him. I mean the real vicar. 
371,GARVIN: What would you call Mister Magister then? 
372,"HAWTHORNE: I mean Canon Smallwood, our old vicar. The one who left in"
373,such mysterious circumstances. 
374,GARVIN: Nothing mysterious about it. Taken ill and had to leave. 
375,HAWTHORNE: Suddenly? In the middle of the night? Without so much as a
376,goodbye to anyone in the village? 
377,GARVIN: I've got no time to listen to your nonsense. I've got my work
378,to do. 
379,HAWTHORNE: Very well then. I'll see the other gentleman. I cannot say
380,that I like him but he is at least a man of the cloth. 
381,"GARVIN: I told you, didn't I? He's not in. "
382,"HAWTHORNE: Well, I intend to find that out for myself. Let me pass"
383,please. 
384,GARVIN: You're wasting your time. 
385,"HAWTHORNE: If you don't stand out of my way, Garvin, I shall be forced"
386,to use violence. 
387,"MASTER: Dear me, I hope that violence will not be necessary. Good"
388,"evening, Miss Hawthorne, and what can I do for you?"
389,
390, [UNIT HQ. room]
391,
392,(Benton is finishing a telephone call.) 
393,"BENTON: Well, that's made a mess of my evening. "
394,(The Brigadier enters in Regimental dress and white gloves.) 
395,"BRIGADIER: Everything in order, Yates? "
396,YATES: Yes sir. No problems. 
397,"BRIGADIER: All right, Benton. Right, and I'm off. You know where to"
398,reach me if anything crops up. 
399,"YATES: Yes sir. Have a good evening, sir. "
400,"BRIGADIER: Thank you, Captain Yates. Goodnight. "
401,"YATES: Goodnight, sir. "
402,"BENTON: Goodnight, sir. "
403,(The Brigadier leaves.) 
404,"BENTON: It's all right for some, isn't it, sir? And we're stuck here"
405,with a television and a plate of corned beef sandwiches!
406,
407, [Churchyard]
408,
409," HAWTHORNE: I beg you to help me, Mister Magister."
410,Help me to stop that foolhardy man. 
411,MASTER: You mean the Professor? But surely 
412,"HAWTHORNE: He must not enter the tomb, tonight of all nights. "
413,MASTER: Why ever not? 
414,HAWTHORNE: Beltane. The forces of evil are abroad tonight. 
415,"MASTER: Really, Miss Hawthorne, as a rational man, I "
416,"HAWTHORNE: We are all in mortal peril, Vicar! Have you no concern for"
417,the souls in your care? 
418,MASTER: The soul as such is a very dated concept. Viewing the matter
419,"existentially, I "
420,"HAWTHORNE: Existentially? Oh, you're a blockhead! "
421,"MASTER: Miss Hawthorne, one moment. You're very distressed, I can see"
422,"that. You know, you really are worrying unduly. "
423,(The Master removes his spectacles and gives her a Look.) 
424,MASTER: There's nothing to worry about. You must believe me. You must
425,believe me. 
426,"HAWTHORNE: Must believe. Oh, why should I believe you? A rationalist,"
427,existentialist priest indeed. 
428,MASTER: Listen to me! 
429,"HAWTHORNE: You're a fool, sir. If you won't help me, I must find"
430,someone who will. 
431,(Hawthorne brandishes her ankh at the Master and leaves. The Master
432,gestures Garvin to follow her.)
433,
434, [Road]
435,
436,(Night has fallen. The Doctor stops Bessie at a
437,junction as Jo tries to read a map by torchlight.) 
438,"DOCTOR: It's no good, we're hopelessly lost. "
439,JO: I can't understand it. We followed the sign posts all right. 
440,"DOCTOR: Well, if we had, we would have been there by now. You must have"
441,missed one. 
442,JO: I did not! 
443,"DOCTOR: If you look at the map the right way up, we might eventually"
444,"get there. Now, which way is it? "
445,"JO: Er, that way. "
446,DOCTOR: Thank you very much.
447,
448, [Barrow] 
449," HARRY: You all right, Alastair? "
450,"FERGUS: Of course I'm all right! Why shouldn't I be, for Pete's sake?"
451,Of all the stupid questions. 
452,"HARRY: Well, I only asked. There's no need to make a production number"
453,out of it. 
454,"FERGUS: I'm sorry, Harry. I'm just a bit on edge. I'll be all right. "
455,"HARRY: Everything okay, Professor? Won't be long now. "
456,HORNER: Any sign of that fool woman? 
457,HARRY: Not so far. 
458,"HORNER: Well, keep her away from me. I'll tell you, lad, I'll do her a"
459,mischief. 
460,"HARRY: Do my best. Now, you've got everything straight? We start with"
461,"an intro from Alastair, then I give you a cue to launch into your spiel"

724,REEVES: It's possible but I think I felt a pulse. 
725,"JO: Oh, then there's a chance? "
726,REEVES: Maybe. He must have the constitution of an ox to be able to
727,survive a reduction of temperature like that.

729,REEVES: You can't always tell by. Hello.

731,"REEVES: Silly, really. I swear it sounds as if he's "
732,WINSTANLEY: What? 
733,REEVES: It's quite ridiculous. It must be an echo off an atypical bone
734,structure. 
735,WINSTANLEY: Sounds as if what?

916,HAWTHORNE: Don't be stupid. Can't you see he's half unconscious? 
917,"GARVIN: Somebody'll have to help him then, won't they? "
918,HAWTHORNE: Yes. Come along. Come on.
919,(Hawthorne drapes Benton's arm over her shoulders to carry him.) 
920,"GARVIN: Right, come on. This way."

924," YATES: Doctor. Doctor, wake up. "
925,JO: You see? He's been like that for hours. 
926,"YATES: Well, shouldn't he be in hospital? "
927,"JO: Well, Doctor Reeves said that we shouldn't move him. "
928,YATES: Then we'll just have to wait. 
929,(Garvin keeps the shotgun pointed at Hawthorne and Benton as they leave
930,the church and walk straight into a bright red light and strong wind.
931,Garvin cowers as Hawthorne gets Benton away round the corner. Then
932,Garvin empties his weapon into whatever it is before he bursts into
933,flames. The pub is also shaking and the air is red with heat as
934,something goes into the church cavern and the decorated stone. The heat
935,and wind stop.) 
936,YATES: Are you all right? 
937,DOCTOR: Eureka!

942,"(Outside the village, a delivery van swerves off the road by the"

948,(The Doctor is up and dressed.) 
949,"JO: Now you're sure you're all right? Look, you'd better come and sit"
950,in this chair over here. Come on. 
951,"DOCTOR: Jo. Jo, please, stop fussing. "
952,"YATES: She's right, you know. Better take it gently. "
953,"DOCTOR: Look, I tell you, I am perfectly all right. It was a bit parky"
954,"up there for a while, I'll admit, but it soon warmed up. "
955,JO: That wave of heat. 
956,"DOCTOR: Yes, the final confirmation of my theory. "
957,JO: You mean you know what caused it? 
958,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. "
959,YATES: Tell us then. 
960,"DOCTOR: No, not just yet. I want to wait until I'm absolutely sure."
961,"Right, I'm going back up to the dig. "
962,"JO: Doctor, haven't you had enough of that place? "
963,BERT: Hello? You better? I thought you'd had it. 
964,"DOCTOR: Fortunately, no. Captain Yates, you'd better wait here, all"
965,"right? (Hawthorne enters, carrying Benton.) "
966,"HAWTHORNE: If I drop him, he'll go with a most dreadful wallop! "
967,YATES: He's out on his feet! 
968,"DOCTOR: Get him over to that bench, quickly! "
969,"BERT: Here, what's happened to your boy? "
970,"YATES: He's been beaten up. By an expert, I'd say. "
971,"HAWTHORNE: Oh, you might indeed say that! You might indeed. "
972,"YATES: Oh, no. "
973,"HAWTHORNE: Oh dear, he's a very heavy young man. "
974,BERT: I'll get a doctor. 
975,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's all right. I am a Doctor. "
976,(Benton groans as the Doctor checks him over.) 
977,"DOCTOR: Well, there are no bones broken or anything. Look, could you"
978,"get me some hot water and some hot sweet tea, perhaps? "
979,"BERT: Yes, sure. "
980,"DOCTOR: Thank you very much. And thank you too, Miss Hawthorne. "
981,HAWTHORNE: You know who I am? 
982,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. It's a great pity they didn't listen to you in"
983,the first place. 
984,"HAWTHORNE: If only they had. Oh, what a tale I'll have to tell them"
985,now!

988, (The Master is on the telephone.)

994,
995," YATES: It was this fellow, Garvin, who did him"
996,over? 
997,"HAWTHORNE: No, no, no, it was the elementals in the cavern. "
998,DOCTOR: Elementals? 
999,"HAWTHORNE: Yes, creatures of the Devil. "
1000,YATES: Did you say the Devil? 
1001,"HAWTHORNE: Yes, dear boy. Satan, Lucifer, the Prince of Darkness,"
1002,"Beelzebub, the Horned Beast. Call him what you like, he was there. "
1003,DOCTOR: You saw the Devil? 
1004,HAWTHORNE: Yes. 
1005,DOCTOR: And what did he look like? 
1006,"HAWTHORNE: Well, it was a glimpse, no more. Twenty, thirty feet high,"
1007,"but the horns were there, and that face. "
1008,JO: The Devil? 
1009,"DOCTOR: Look, Miss Hawthorne, I agreed with you from the first about"
1010,"the danger, but now I think you're utterly mistaken. Whatever else you"
1011,saw it certainly was not the Devil. 
1012,HAWTHORNE: But it was! There's a Satanist cult in this village and last
1013,night they held a sabbat. 
1014,YATES: A sabbat? 
1015,"HAWTHORNE: Yes, an occult ceremony to call up the Devil. "
1016,JO: And it worked! The Devil came! 
1017,"DOCTOR: Nonsense, Jo. Miss Hawthorne, who is the leader of this cult? "
1018,HAWTHORNE: The new vicar. He calls himself Magister. 
1019,"DOCTOR: Magister. Yes, of course, I should have known. "
1020,JO: What? 
1021,"DOCTOR: Jo, did you fail Latin as well as science? Magister is the"
1022,Latin word for Master!

1030,BRIGADIER: Petrol fire? 
1031,"MAN: No, it just went up in a flash. "
1032,"BRIGADIER: During the earth tremor's, was it? "
1033,MAN: No. Just after it stopped. I was about to get back in and drive
1034,"back to the village and bingo, off it went. "
1035,BRIGADIER: Is that Devil's End over there? 
1036,(The Brigadier points with his swagger stick promptly bursts into
1037,flames. He tries again. The ground beneath the area is black.) 
1038,BRIGADIER: Must be some sort of heat barrier. We'll try getting in from
1039,the south. 
1040,"(Meanwhile, the Doctor and Jo are clearing the fallen tree, which they"
1041,have cut into manageable pieces.)

1043,JO: Yes. 
1044,"(Bessie can now drive on, but coming in from the south, the Brigadier"
1045,is stopped by another heat haze. He tests it with a dead twig.)

1054, [Road]
1055,
1056," BRIGADIER: I see, Yates. So, the Doctor was frozen"
1057,stiff at the barrow and was then revived by a freak heat wave. Benton
1058,was beaten up by invisible forces and the local white witch claims
1059,she's seen the Devil. 
1060,"YATES : Yes, sir. I know it sounds a bit wild. "
1061,"BRIGADIER: It does indeed, Yates. Now listen, I'm bringing up some men"
1062,to investigate this heat barrier. Let me talk to the Doctor. Over.

1085,Constable Groom lying under the remains of the gate.) 
1086,DOCTOR: Poor fellow. 
1087,JO: Do you know what killed him? 
1088,"DOCTOR: Well, it certainly wasn't the Devil. At least, not exactly. "
1089,JO: What do you mean? 
1090,"DOCTOR: Look, I'm going in. Would you prefer to wait outside? "
1091,"JO: No. I'd rather stick with you, if I wouldn't be in the way. "
1092,"DOCTOR: No, of course not. I'd be glad of the company. Come on. "
1093,"(They go down the tunnel into the middle of the mound, and a stone"

1102,"DOCTOR: If my theory's right, we're all in mortal danger. "
1103,JO: Everyone in the village? 
1104,DOCTOR: Everyone in the whole world. Ah. (He sees something on the
1105,floor and brushes the soil away.) 
1106,JO: What is it? 
1107,DOCTOR: Metal. 
1108,JO: It looks like a model spaceship. 
1109,DOCTOR: That's right. Except that it isn't a model. 
1110,JO: What is it then? 
1111,"DOCTOR: Jo, look at the shape of this tomb. "
1112,"JO: Well, it looks like that spaceship. "
1113,"DOCTOR: A different size, that's all. Now you try picking it up. "
1114,JO: I can't. It's fixed down. 
1115,DOCTOR: The reason why you can't pick it up is that is weighs about
1116,"seven hundred and fifty tons, at a rough guess. "
1117,"JO: Oh, come on, be serious. "
1118,DOCTOR: Be serious. All right. About a hundred thousand years ago

1140,JO: How did you do that? 
1141,DOCTOR: Iron. It's an old magical defence. 
1142,JO: But you don't believe in magic. 
1143,"DOCTOR: I don't, but he did. Luckily. "
1144,JO: Was that a spell you said? 
1145,"DOCTOR: No, it's the first line of an old Venusian lullaby, as a matter"
1146,"of fact. Roughly translated it goes, 'Close your eyes, my darling."
1147,"Well, three of them, at least'. "
1148,JO: Doctor. 
1149,"DOCTOR: I must admit, that thing took me completely by surprise. "
1150,JO: What was it? 
1151,DOCTOR: It looked like a gargoyle made of stone. 
1152,JO: But it was alive. 
1153,"DOCTOR: In a sense, yes. "
1154,"JO: But that wasn't what Miss Hawthorne described, surely? "
1155,"DOCTOR: No, the creature she saw must have been a hundred times more"
1156,hideous. 
1157,JO: And neither of them were the Devil.

1167,"MASTER: Ah, a man of spirit are you? That's exactly what's wanted at a"
1168,time like this. 
1169,WINSTANLEY: I still don't understand what you're talking about. 
1170,"MASTER: Decadence, that's what I'm talking about. It's what I see on"
1171,"every side. All this talk of democracy, freedom, liberty. "
1172,(The Master fixes Winstanley with a Look.) 
1173,"MASTER: What this country needs is strength, power and decision. And"
1174,those are what you can give to it. 
1175,"WINSTANLEY: Yes. Yes, you're right, of course. "
1176,MASTER: I am the Master. I control a power which can save this world.
1177,"If you choose, you can share my triumph. "
1178,WINSTANLEY: Power? What power? 
1179,MASTER: I control the forces that have been released in Devil's End
1180,over the last few hours. 
1181,WINSTANLEY: All that fuss up on the dig? Are you trying to tell me it
1182,was you? 
1183,MASTER: Exactly. 
1184,"WINSTANLEY: Well, that's ridiculous! "
1185,"MASTER: You need proof, do you? Very well, you shall have it. "
1186,"(The Master concentrates, and a strong wind blows the front doors open"
1187,and a flowerpot off a table. A portrait falls from the wall.)

1201,know. 
1202,DOCTOR: You've all been asking me for explanations. Perhaps these will
1203,help me to provide them. 
1204,"HAWTHORNE: Well, there is only one possible explanation. This is the"
1205,supernatural at work. 
1206,DOCTOR: Nonsense. 
1207,"BENTON: Yes, well, what about the thing that got me? That was real"
1208,enough. 
1209,"DOCTOR: There's nothing more real than a forcefield, Sergeant, even a"
1210,psionic one. 
1211,(The Doctor looks at a selection of photographic slides.) 
1212,HAWTHORNE: You're being deliberately obtuse. We're dealing with the

1215,HAWTHORNE: Magic! 
1216,"DOCTOR: Science, Miss Hawthorne. "

1218,JO: And how can we stop it without knowing what it is? 
1219,"DOCTOR: Well done, Jo. You're being logical at last. I'll turn you into"
1220,"a scientist yet. Right, if there are no more interruptions, I'll tell"

1280,high. 
1281,"YATES: I can understand that part of it all right, but can't you"

1283,"DOCTOR: Yes, all right. Jo, Captain Yates, would you mind drawing the"
1284,curtains? 
1285,(The Doctor sits behind a slide projector.) 
1286,"DOCTOR: Come on, Jo, stir your stumps. Now then. All right? Now then,"
1287,tell me. Who's that? 
1288,(A papyrus image of a ram's head with the solar disc between its

1290,"JO: An Egyptian god, isn't it? "
1291,"DOCTOR: Top of the class, Jo, top of the class. That's right, that's"
1292,"the Egyptian god Khnum, with horns. There's another one, a Hindu demon."
1293,
1294,ALL: With horns. 
1295,DOCTOR: Oh. Thank you very much. And our old friend the Horned Beast. 
1296,YATES: I don't get it. 
1297,"DOCTOR: Probably because I haven't finished, Captain Yates. "
1298,"YATES: Oh sorry, Doctor. "
1299,"HAWTHORNE: Oh, you could go on all day and all night showing us pretty"
1300,"pictures. I mean, horns have been a symbol of power ever since "
1301,"DOCTOR: Ever since man began? Exactly. But why? All right, Captain"
1302,"Yates, the curtains. Now creatures like those have been seen over and"
1303,"over again throughout the history of man, and man has turned them into"
1304,"myths, gods or devils, but they're neither. They are, in fact,"
1305,creatures from another world. 
1306,BENTON: Do you mean like the Axons and the Cybermen? 
1307,"DOCTOR: Precisely, only far, far older and immeasurably more dangerous."
1308,
1309,JO: And they came here in spaceships like that tiny one up at the
1310,barrow? 
1311,"DOCTOR: That's right. They're Daemons from the planet Daemos, which is?"
1312,
1313,JO: Sixty thousand light years away on the other side of the galaxy. 
1314,DOCTOR: And they first came to Earth nearly one hundred thousand years
1315,ago.

1322,"WINSTANLEY: Yes. Meeting to order, please. Thank you. Thank you, ladies"
1323,"and gentlemen. Well now, it seemed to me that we ought to get together"
1324,"and discuss the situation, before it gets out of hand. Now it seems"
1325,"that the vicar here has had a few thoughts on the subject, so I've"
1326,asked him to put in a word. Mister Magister. 
1327, [The Cloven Hoof bar]
1328,
1329," JO: A spaceship, fifteen inches long? "
1330,"DOCTOR: That's right. Mind you, when it landed it was two hundred feet"
1331,"long and thirty feet across. But they diminished it, just as they"
1332,"diminished themselves, which accounts for the heat wave and the"
1333,freeze-up. 
1334,"JO: Hmm? Sorry, could you say that again? I didn't quite follow you. "
1335,"DOCTOR: Oh, come on, Jo. E=MC squared. "
1336,JO: You're the Doctor. 
1337,"DOCTOR: Look, when you lose mass the energy has to go somewhere. "
1338,"YATES: I see, so all we've got to deal with is something which is"
1339,"either too small to see or thirty feet tall, can incinerate you or"
1340,"freeze you to death, turns stone images into homicidal monsters and"
1341,looks like the very devil. 
1342,DOCTOR: Exactly. 
1343,"BENTON: Well, I still don't get it. I mean, what's the creature doing"
1344,"here? I mean, why did they ever come? "
1345,DOCTOR: To help Homo sapiens kick out Neanderthal man. They've been
1346,"coming and going ever since. The Greek civilisation, the Renaissance,"
1347,the industrial revolution. They were all inspired by the Daemons. 
1348,"HAWTHORNE: But this thing the Professor let loose is evil, you said so"
1349,yourself and now you're trying to say they've been helping mankind for

1351,"JO: Yes, and you say they come from another planet. Well then, what's"
1352,all this jazz about witchcraft and covens and so on? 
1353,"DOCTOR: Look, don't you see? All the magical traditions are just"
1354,"remnants of their advanced science, and that is what the Master is"
1355,using. 
1356,HAWTHORNE: Then these creatures are linked with the black arts. They
1357,are evil. 
1358,"DOCTOR: Amoral, perhaps. They help Earth but on their own terms. It's a"
1359,scientific experiment to them. Just another laboratory rat. 
1360,YATES: Then what's the Master up to? 
1361,DOCTOR: He's established a link with the Daemon. What worries me is the
1362,choice. Domination by the Master or total annihilation. 
1363,"JO: What, this Daemon could destroy the world? "
1364,DOCTOR: What does any scientist do with an experiment that fails? He
1365,chucks it in the rubbish bin. 
1366,JO: The end of the world.

1370," MASTER: Now, as I've told you, this is not going"
1371,"to be a sermon. But all the same, I do beg of you to listen carefully."
1372,Because this could be the most important day in your lives. Now as you
1373,"know, I am a newcomer among you, and yet already I feel that I know you"
1374,"all. For instance, you, Mister Thorpe. Are you still padding the"
1375,grocery bills of the local gentry? 
1376,THORPE: What are you on about? That's slander. 
1377,"MASTER: Now, now, don't deny it. I know. And you, Charlie. How's your"
1378,conscience? Do you think you'll manage to balance the Post Office books
1379,"in time? And you, Mister Grenville. Has your wife come back from her"
1380,"sisters yet? Will she ever come back, do you suppose? Now, now, no,"
1381,please. Please do not be angry with me. I assure you that I'm on your
1382,"side. Now, listen. If you do what I say, you can all of you get"

1388,and the third time he'll probably tell us what our fate is to be. Now
1389,he'll be in the cavern somewhere awaiting the Master's second call. 
1390,"BENTON: Then if we know where he is, why don't we go and find him? "
1391,"DOCTOR: You'd be wasting your time, Sergeant. At the moment he's so"

1394,"DOCTOR: Jo, would you get me a piece of paper and a pencil, please? "

1518,"he gets punched on the jaw repeatedly. Finally Girton knocks Yates out,"

1537,"DOCTOR: No, you keep away. It's me he's after, not you. "
1538,(Yates peels away. Girton buzzes Bessie again within sight of the
1539,Brigadier and his men.)

1553,plume of smoke from the churchyard and is happy. The Doctor and Yates
1554,run over to where Jo is lying.) 
1555,YATES: How is she? 
1556,DOCTOR: She's had a nasty knock on the head. She'll be all right. You'd
1557,better load her into Bessie and take her down to the pub. She'll be
1558,needing rest and quiet for a bit. 
1559,YATES: Okay. What about you? 
1560,"DOCTOR: Well, I'd better go and have a word with the Brigadier. He's"
1561,probably bursting a blood vessel by now. 
1562,"(Yates puts Jo into Bessie, while the Doctor drives to the barrier on"
1563,"the motorcycle. In the church cavern, the Master, in his red robe,"
1564,orders Bok back to his pedestal and stands before the altar.)

1567,"DOCTOR: You've got the mind of an accountant, Lethbridge Stewart. So,"

1569,"BRIGADIER: Yes, and I advise you to keep your distance. "
1570,DOCTOR: Yes? 
1571,(The Doctor throws a small stone into the barrier. It disintegrates in
1572,a flash.) 
1573,DOCTOR: Hmm. Even rock. 
1574,"BRIGADIER: Wood, rock, four inch armour plate. You name it, we've tried"
1575,it. It's impenetrable. 
1576,"DOCTOR: A hasty and inaccurate assessment, Brigadier. Tell me, have you"
1577,got enough cable to reach those high tension pylons over there. 
1578,"BRIGADIER: Yes, we should have. Why? "
1579,DOCTOR: We'll need at least ten thousand volts to get through this lot.

1587,"OSGOOD: What's the principle, sir? "
1588,"DOCTOR: Negative diathermy, Sergeant. Buffer the molecular movement of"
1589,the air with the reverse phase short waves. It's quite simple.

1789,"alone. Next time, I shall use the full ceremony. Every possible member"

2145,DOCTOR: I'm not a magician or a wizard or anything of the sort. 
2146,BERT: See! I told you!

2157,"DOCTOR: Science, not sorcery, Miss Hawthorne. Look. "
2158,(The Doctor holds up the remote control and makes Bessie honk her horn
2159,and flash her headlights.) 
2160,VILLAGER: That's amazing. 
2161,BENTON: I'll be blowed. 
2162,DOCTOR: And your Mister Magister uses no more magic than that. 
2163,BERT: You're talking rubbish. The Master's a magician I tell you! 
2164,DOCTOR: All his feats are based on science. Either ours or the secret
2165,science of the Daemons. 
2166,"BERT: Well, there you are. That proves you're talking nonsense. How"
2167,could he have called him up in the first place except by sorcery? 
2168,"DOCTOR: Well, he uses violent emotions. Fear, hatred, greed. "
2169,THORPE: How? 
2170,"DOCTOR: Well, the emotions of a group of ordinary human beings generate"
2171,a tremendous charge of psychokinetic energy. This the Master channels
2172,for his own purpose. 
2173,HAWTHORNE: But that is magic. That's precisely what black magic is. 
2174,"DOCTOR: No, Miss Hawthorne, I'm afraid not. "
2175,"HAWTHORNE: Are you trying to tell me that the invocations, the rituals,"
2176,even the sabbat itself are just so much window dressing? 
2177,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, of course not. No, they are essential to generate"
2178,"and control the psionic forces, and to control the Daemon himself. "
2179,"BENTON: Look, shouldn't we get over there and sort this Daemon thing"
2180,out?

2182,"BENTON: Well, I could get the men "
2183,DOCTOR: Yes? 
2184,"BENTON: Well, we could "
2185,DOCTOR: Exactly. All we can do is wait. 
2186,"BENTON: Well, what for? "
2187,DOCTOR: The energy exchanger. This machine that the Brigadier is
2188,building for me. With that I should be able to drain off our visitor's
2189,energy. Then perhaps we can sort him out.

2216,"YATES: Doctor! Doctor, it's Jo. "
2217,DOCTOR: Jo? I thought she was still in the pub? 
2218,(Benton unties Yates' hands.) 
2219,YATES: They've got her in the cavern. 
2220,DOCTOR: What? 
2221,YATES: That creature's in there. The Master calls him Azal. 
2222,"HAWTHORNE: Azal? Of course! Azael, the fallen angel. "
2223,"DOCTOR: Walkie talkie. Hello, Brigadier? Are you there?"

2227," BRIGADIER: That you, Doctor?"

2231, BRIGADIER : Over. 
2232,"DOCTOR: Look, they've got Jo. That machine must come through now. Now,"
2233,do you understand?!
2234,
2235, [Heat barrier]
2236,
2237, DOCTOR : Now! 
2238,"BRIGADIER: We're on our way, Doctor."
2239,
2240, [Village Green]
2241,
2242," DOCTOR: Good. And put a watch up on that barrow,"
2243,will you? Just in case the Daemon's ship reactivates.
2244,
2245, [Heat barrier]
2246,
2247," BRIGADIER: Will do, Doctor. Over and out. You"
2248,"heard him, Sergeant. Now. "

2263,
2264, (The power from the grid is building in the
2265,"machine, and smoke is starting to come out of it.) "

2268,
2269, [Village Green]

2283, (Where its appearance at the church gate stops the
2284,posse in its tracks.) 
2285,"YATES: Right, Benton. You keep us covered. We'll get in round the back."
2286,
2287,DOCTOR: No. We must wait for the Brigadier. 
2288,YATES: And what about Jo? 
2289,DOCTOR: We won't help her by committing suicide. 
2290,"(Bert gets free of Thorpe and another man, and runs towards the"
2291,church.) 
2292,BERT: Magister! Magister! 
2293,(Bok blocks his way.) 
2294,"BERT: No, no. A friend. I'm a friend. "
2295,(Bok zaps him into nothingness.) 
2296,"DOCTOR: You see? What's going on, Brigadier?"
2297,
2298, [Heat barrier]
2299,
2300, DOCTOR : You must hurry! 
2301,"BRIGADIER: We're up to the maximum now, Doctor. It's still no good. "
2302,DOCTOR : You'll have to use the booster. 
2303,"OSGOOD: If you do, sir, she'll blow us all sky high! "
2304,"BRIGADIER: We're coming through, Doctor. Over and out. Booster on. "
2305,OSGOOD: But sir. 
2306,"BRIGADIER: Damn it, man. Get on with it. "
2307,(Osgood hesitates so the Brigadier pushes down the lever labelled Boost
2308,himself.)

2325,(An archway appears in the heat barrier. The Brigadier tests it with
2326,"his swagger stick, which smokes but does not burst into flames.) "
2327,"BRIGADIER: Right, it's still hot, but passable. Right, start up and"
2328,keep to the tunnel.

2344,"DOCTOR: Well, that should have come through first. "
2345,"BENTON: Doctor, look. "
2346,(Bok is staggering around.) 
2347,DOCTOR: The exchanger is working. It's bleeding off the energy.

2355,"BRIGADIER: You can stop worrying, Doctor. We're through. "
2356,"DOCTOR : And about time, too. Now get it over here fast! "
2357,BRIGADIER: Right.

2366,BRIGADIER : The machine's gone west. Blown itself up. Be with you
2367,right away. Over and out.

2369,"Captain Yates, I'm going in before that creature recovers. "
2370,"YATES: I'll come with you, Doctor. "
2371,DOCTOR: Alone! 
2372,"THORPE: You can't go in now, sir. You said yourself it would be"
2373,suicide. 
2374,"YATES: Doctor, wait! "
2375,(The Doctor dodges round the still-staggering Bok and runs for the
2376,church. He slams the vestry door shut just as Bok sends an energy bolt
2377,at him.)

2389, (The UNIT convoy arrives in record time for a five
2390,mile dash.)

2393,BRIGADIER: Then what are we waiting for? Let's get after him. 
2394,"YATES: Wait, sir. Look. "
2395,(Bok is watching the newcomers.) 
2396,BRIGADIER: What the blazes is that? Some kind of ornament? 
2397,"YATES: Not exactly, sir. Watch. "
2398,"(Yates throws a rock at Bok, who zaps it into atoms.) "
2399,"BRIGADIER: Yes, I see what you mean. Never mind, we'll soon fix him."
2400,Jenkins! 
2401,JENKINS: Sir. 
2402,BRIGADIER: Chap with the wings there.  Five
2403,rounds rapid.

2407,
2408," MASTER: You realise, of course, that you're a"
2409,"doomed man, Doctor? "
2410,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm a dead man. I knew that as soon as I came through that"
2411,"door, so you'd better watch out. You see, I've nothing to lose, have I?"
2412,
2413,"MASTER: Enough! Azal, destroy him! "
2414,AZAL: Who is this?! 
2415,"MASTER: My enemy and yours, Azal. Destroy him! "
2416,AZAL: This is the one we spoke of. He too is not of this planet. 
2417,MASTER: He is a meddler and a fool. 
2418,"AZAL: He is not a fool, yet he has done a foolish thing coming here."
2419,Why did you come? 
2420,DOCTOR: I came to talk to you. 
2421,AZAL: Talk then. 
2422,DOCTOR: Certainly. But first let her go. 
2423,MASTER: No! 
2424,"(Azal sends electricity at the acolytes holding Jo, and they free her.)"

2426,JO: Doctor! 
2427,"DOCTOR: Are you all right, Jo? "
2428,JO: I am now. 
2429,AZAL: You wish to talk? 
2430,DOCTOR: Yes. I want you to leave this planet while you still can. 
2431,AZAL: You are bold. 
2432,DOCTOR: Why not? I've got a machine outside that can annihilate you. 
2433,AZAL: You lie. 
2434,DOCTOR: You've already felt its power. 
2435,AZAL: It is destroyed. 
2436,"DOCTOR: One of them, yes. Not both. "
2437,AZAL: You lie. There was but one. 
2438,JO: Doctor? 
2439,AZAL: You have a regard for truth. Why do you lie? 
2440,DOCTOR: To try and make you listen to me. 
2441,AZAL: Why should I? I see no consequence of value. 
2442,MASTER: Then kill him. Kill him now! 
2443,AZAL: Very well. 
2444,(Azal aims his hand at the Doctor.) 
2445,JO: No! 
2446,"DOCTOR: If you kill me now, you will wonder throughout eternity whether"
2447,you should have listened to my words.

2449, [Village Green]
2450,
2451, (The villagers have taken shelter indoors as UNIT
2452,continue to try and shoot Bok.) 
2453,"YATES: Might as well use a peashooter on four inch armour. Sergeant,"
2454,"get the bazooka set up over there, quick. "
2455,"BENTON: Right, sir. Right, you with me."
2456,
2457, [Church cavern]
2458,
2459, MASTER: Well? You waste time. I order you to kill
2460,"him, Azal! "
2461,AZAL: I command. I do not obey. 
2462,MASTER: But I called you here and you came? 
2463,AZAL: I answered your call because the time was come for my awakening.
2464,The time has come for the completion of the experiment or its
2465,destruction. 
2466,MASTER: Then fulfill your mission by granting the ultimate power to me.
2467,Who else is there strong enough to give these humans the leadership
2468,they need? 
2469,DOCTOR: I seem to remember somebody else speaking like that. What was
2470,"the bounder's name? Hitler. Yes, that's right, Adolf Hitler. Or was it"
2471,Genghis Khan? 
2472,"MASTER: Azal, I have the will. You yourself said so. "
2473,AZAL: I am still not convinced. 
2474,DOCTOR: I'm very pleased to hear it. 
2475,AZAL: You wish to see this planet destroyed? 
2476,"DOCTOR: By no means. You see, I have an alternative. "
2477,AZAL: State it. 
2478,DOCTOR: Leave humanity alone. Just go. You've done enough harm. 
2479,AZAL: We gave knowledge to man. 
2480,DOCTOR: You certainly did. Thanks to you man can now blow up the world
2481,and he probably will. He can poison the water and the very air he
2482,breathes. He's already started. He can 
2483,AZAL: Enough! Is man such a failure then? Shall I destroy him? 
2484,MASTER: No! A strong leader can force him to learn. 
2485,AZAL: You are right. I have decided. I shall pass on my power. 
2486,"MASTER: O mighty Azal, I thank you. "
2487,AZAL: But not to you. To him. 
2488,"DOCTOR: No! No, I don't want it!"

2492,(Bok zaps one soldier as the others fire from
2493,behind gravestones. Benton brings the bazooka to the retaining wall and
2494,takes aim.)

2499,(Bok reforms from the pieces.)
2500,
2501, [Church cavern]
2502,
2503, AZAL: You refuse my gift? 
2504,DOCTOR: Of course I do! Don't you understand? I want you to leave. I
2505,want you to go away and give man a chance to grow up. 
2506,AZAL: I cannot. My instructions are precise. I bequeath my power or I
2507,destroy all. 
2508,MASTER: Then you will give your power to me? 
2509,AZAL: I shall. Time is short. 
2510,MASTER: What about him? 
2511,AZAL: He is not rational. He is disruptive. He must be eliminated. 
2512,"(Azal's electricity starts to play over the Doctor's body, then Jo"
2513,stands in front of him.) 
2514,"JO: No! No, he's a good man! Kill me, not him! "
2515,"(Jo braces herself for the kill shot, but Azal clutches his wrist in"
2516,pain as his power turns in on himself.) 
2517,AZAL: This action does not relate. There is no data. It does not
2518,"relate. Go! Leave me, all of you! "
2519,"(Bristling with surplus energy, Azal totters and the humans flee the"
2520,building.)

2525,down and assumes its original gargoyle pose.)

2531, (Somehow the Master has got ahead of everyone as
2532,the church goes KaBOOM!! throwing the runners to the ground. The women
2533,come out of their homes and Benton trains his pistol on the Master.) 
2534,BENTON: Get up. Don't try anything. 
2535,"BRIGADIER: What happened in there, Doctor? "
2536,"DOCTOR: Well, by a ridiculous and foolhardy act of self-sacrifice, Jo"
2537,here has managed to save us. 
2538,JO: I did? 
2539,"DOCTOR: You did. You see, Azal couldn't face an act as irrational and"
2540,"as illogical as her being prepared to give up her life for me. Look,"
2541,"Jo, why don't you go and get out of that ridiculous garb? "
2542,JO: Okay. 
2543,YATES: So what happened? 
2544,"DOCTOR: Well, all his power was turned against himself. You might say"
2545,he blew a fuse. 
2546,(Boom!) 
2547,"YATES: Greyhound Two, come in, please. Over. "
2548,"CHALMERS : Chalmers here at the dig, sir. Are you all right? Over, "
2549,YATES: Couldn't be better. What's happening? 
2550,"CHALMERS : Big bang at the dig, sir. "
2551,"DOCTOR: The spaceship. Automatic self-destruct, I suppose. "
2552,CHALMERS : And the barrier's cleared itself. Over. 
2553,YATES: Good show. We're coming out now with one prisoner. Over and out.
2554,
2555,"BRIGADIER: Benton, get ready to move out. "
2556,"BENTON: Yes, sir. Right, you lot, you heard the man. The picnic's over."
2557,
2558,(The Master throws his cope over Benton and runs to Bessie. Benton
2559,shoots at him and the Brigadier joins in as the Master drives away.) 
2560,DOCTOR: Stop firing. You'll damage Bessie. 
2561,BRIGADIER: Do you want him to get away? 
2562,"DOCTOR: Don't worry, Bessie'll bring him back. "
2563,(Jo is back in her proper clothes as Bessie turns a circle and returns
2564,the prisoner.) 
2565,BRIGADIER: How on Earth did you do that? 
2566,"DOCTOR: Simple, if you know how. "
2567,"BRIGADIER: Right, Benton, get them moved out. And take him with you."

2569,"BENTON: Yes, sir. Right, get moving! "
2570,DOCTOR: And look after him. I want to deal with him later. 
2571,"MASTER: Do you, Doctor? You always were an optimist, weren't you. "
2572,DOCTOR: Thank you for the compliment. 
2573,"BENTON: All right, move. "
2574,"(The Master gets out of Bessie and into the back of a Land Rover,"
2575,"accompanied by six burly soldiers with their rifles pointing at him,"
2576,and is driven away. The villagers boo him as he leaves.) 
2577,HAWTHORNE: Listen. 
2578,DOCTOR: To what? 
2579,"JO: Yes, the birds are singing again. "
2580,"HAWTHORNE: Oh, and smell the flowers. "
2581,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, it makes a change from the smell of sulphur, doesn't"
2582,it? 
2583,HAWTHORNE: The May day miracle has happened again. The Earth is born
2584,anew. 
2585,(The morris starts up again.) 
2586,"BENTON: All under way, sir. "
2587,"HAWTHORNE: Sergeant, we must do the fertility dance to celebrate. "
2588,"BENTON: Oh, no, I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm still rather busy. "
2589,"HAWTHORNE: Oh, nonsense, Sergeant. Come along. "
2590,"JO: Come on, Doctor. "
2591,"YATES: Fancy a dance, Brigadier? "
2592,"BRIGADIER: It's kind of you, Captain Yates. I think I'd rather have a"
2593,pint.
