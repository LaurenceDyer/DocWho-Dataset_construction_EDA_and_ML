20,One 
21, [A London park] 
22, (Welcome to an eerily quiet London. The Albert
23,"Embankment, the Cenotaph, Trafalgar Square, the West End, Old"
24,"Billingsgate, Smithfield, everywhere that there is usually humanity"
25,moving all hours of the day or night are empty. A dog sniffs around a
26,car where the driver's door has been left open. A milk float is
27,"abandoned, with a smashed milk bottle and the money bag lying on the"
28,pavement. Children's toys are left alone in the grass. The quiet is
29,shattered by the Tardis materialising.) 
30,SARAH: It seems to be all right. 
31,"DOCTOR: Well, I told you I'd get you back home safely, didn't I? "
32,SARAH: We set off from the Research Centre. 
33,"DOCTOR: Well, there's no point in going back there. No, I set course"
34,for UNIT HQ. 
35,"SARAH: Well, this isn't UNIT HQ. "
36,"DOCTOR: The space time coordinates were a bit out, that's all. We can't"
37,be far away. 
38,SARAH: So where are we? 
39,DOCTOR: Somewhere in London. 
40,SARAH: And when? 
41,"DOCTOR: Well, when we left. Give or take a few weeks. "
42,SARAH: It's not the nineteenth century or the twenty first? 
43,"DOCTOR: My dear Sarah, you are perfectly safe. Now all we've got to do"
44,now is go and find a telephone and ring the Brigadier. 
45,(The sound of a tree crashing to the ground.) 
46,SARAH: What was that? 
47,"DOCTOR: Well, the parks department's cutting down some trees. Come on. "
48,"(Behind the Tardis are two deckchairs, one knocked over.)"
49,
50, [A London road]
51,
52, (The Doctor finds a public telephone box but can't
53,get a dialing tone.) 
54,"DOCTOR: No, it doesn't work. "
55,SARAH: It's probably been vandalised. 
56,"DOCTOR: That's a very unfair word, you know, because actually the"
57,"Vandals were quite decent chaps. Come on, let's see if we can go and"
58,find a taxi. 
59,"SARAH: Some hopes. Well, there's a bus stop. "
60,DOCTOR: Yes. 
61,(There is life somewhere. A man comes down the fire escape of a large
62,"building, but ducks out of sight when a Land Rover comes round the"
63,"corner with armed troops in it. Once it has gone past, the man hurries"
64,"down to his own car, throws a bag onto the passenger seat and drives"
65,off.) 
66,SARAH: There's no bus. 
67,"DOCTOR: There's no anything. No, nothing's moving. No bicycles, no"
68,"pedestrians, no cars, nothing. "
69,SARAH: Why? 
70,"DOCTOR: Well, perhaps it's Sunday. Great Britain always closes on"
71,"Sundays. Come on, I think we'd better walk. "
72,"(The man in the car appears, but doesn't slow down when they gesture"
73,"for a lift. In fact, he nearly hits them.) "
74,SARAH: Charming! 
75,"DOCTOR: Well, perhaps he doesn't like hitch-hikers."
76,
77, [Jeweller's shop]
78,
79, (The car pulls up outside a parade of shops in
80,"Moorfields and the driver gets out, taking his bag with him. The Doctor"
81,"and Sarah arrive, and see the car with its passenger door left open."
82,They investigate. The man is inside looking over some chains and other
83,jewellery when he looks up and hides. The Doctor and Sarah enter.) 
84,DOCTOR: Anybody here? 
85,SARAH: Look. 
86,(Sarah has spotted the bag on the counter. The man appears holding a
87,sawn off shotgun.) 
88,PHILLIPS: I got here first. Turn round. Hands against that wall. 
89,"DOCTOR: Do as he says, Sarah. Sarah, do as he says! Look, I realise"
90,"that you're very busy, but would you mind telling me what's going on"
91,around here? 
92,PHILLIPS: You find your own places. There's plenty to choose from. I
93,got here first. 
94,(Phillips runs out.) 
95,"DOCTOR: Sarah, no! He's liable to shoot you out of pure terror. "
96,SARAH: I'll call the police. 
97,(Phillips drives away. Sarah dials 999.) 
98,SARAH: They're not answering. 
99,(Outside is a screech of tyres and a deep roar. The Doctor and Sarah
100,run out to see the car looking as if it had wrapped itself around a
101,"concrete pillar, but there is nothing in sight that it could have hit."
102,Phillips lies dead on the pavement.)
103,
104,[UNIT HQ - temporary]
105,
106, (A radio operator writes down a message.) 
107,"OGDEN: Right, okay, got it. Sarge? Another sighting. "
108,"BENTON: Thank you, Ogden. "
109,(Benton marks it on a map while the Brigadier talks on a telephone.) 
110,"BRIGADIER: Yes, that's right. Frequency of sightings about the same."
111,"There's not much we can do, sir, except plot them. No, sir, the Doctor"
112,"isn't back yet. I'm hoping he'll return very soon. Yes, all right. Yes,"
113,"all right, sir, I'll keep you informed. Goodbye. "
114,"YATES: Yes, got that. Thank you. Sir? Five more looters have been"
115,picked up in Hyde Park. 
116,"BRIGADIER: Ogden. Get this off to General Finch, will you? "
117,OGDEN: Sir. 
118,BRIGADIER: I've asked the regulars for more men. We've got to get more
119,patrols out. 
120,"YATES: It's organised gangs now, sir. "
121,BRIGADIER: What? 
122,YATES: The looters. 
123,"BRIGADIER: Well, it's only to be expected. "
124,YATES: We're going to need more detention centres. 
125,"BRIGADIER: Yes, all right, Yates. Get them set up! The looters are a"
126,detail. It's these we've got to worry about.
127,
128, [London]
129,
130, (A police station is locked up. The Doctor is
131,carrying Phillips' bag of loot.) 
132,SARAH: There must be somebody somewhere. 
133,DOCTOR: Listen. 
134,SARAH: Over there. 
135,(A Land Rover drives past the end of the road.) 
136,DOCTOR: It's stopping. Come on. 
137,"(The Land Rover reverses into a mews garage, and the doors shut before"
138,the Doctor and Sarah arrive.)
139,
140,[Garage]
141,
142, (The Doctor and Sarah enter.) 
143,DOCTOR: Hello? Hello? 
144,"(Two men drop something and hide, then one reappears holding an iron"
145,"bar. The Doctor easily deals with him, but the second man hits him over"
146,the head then throws off Sarah. Outside there is automatic weapon fire.
147,The two men get up and run out. Sarah goes to help the Doctor.) 
148,SARAH: Are you all right? 
149,"DOCTOR: Not really, no. Help me up, will you? "
150,(Vehicles drive past outside.) 
151,"DOCTOR: Oh, it's an ill wind. At least we've got some transport. Open"
152,"that door, Sarah, will you? "
153,(The Doctor puts Phillips' bag into the Land Rover as Sarah tries the
154,garage doors.) 
155,SARAH: They're jammed. 
156,(Something screeches nearby and what looks like a small pterodactyl
157,glides down the stairs and buzzes Sarah and the Doctor.) 
158,"DOCTOR: Get out! Come on, in the back! "
159,"(The Doctor throws a sack at the flying lizard, which gets caught it"
160,its claws. They get into the Land Rover and it smashes the drivers
161,"window with its long toothed beak. The Doctor fights it off, gets the"
162,Land Rover started and smashes through the doors. Registration 20DM58 -
163,must be military.)
164,
165, [UNIT HQ - temporary]
166,
167," BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, sir, I can't agree to that. "
168,"FINCH: I'm giving you a direct order, Brigadier. "
169,"BRIGADIER: With respect, sir, I cannot and will not allow troops under"
170,my command to open fire upon civilians. 
171,"FINCH: These civilians are looters, and central London is under martial"
172,law. 
173,"BRIGADIER: What's happening is deplorable, sir, but may I remind you"
174,that looters are not our main problem? Shortage of observation patrols
175,is. 
176,FINCH: The army has been stretched to its limits with the evacuation of
177,eight million people. 
178,"BRIGADIER: The evacuation is now complete, sir. "
179,"FINCH: For you, perhaps, but not for us. All these wretched people have"
180,"to be fed, sheltered, cared for. "
181,"BRIGADIER: But the front line's here, sir, in central London. It's more"
182,important to find the cause of this crisis than to deal with its
183,effects. 
184,"FINCH: All right, but what are you doing about it? "
185,BRIGADIER: Plotting the incidents as they occur and searching London to
186,find their cause. 
187,FINCH: And waiting for this mysterious scientific advisor of yours to
188,turn up? 
189,"BRIGADIER: That's right, sir. "
190,FINCH: Hmm. I suppose he'll just materialise out of thin air. 
191,BRIGADIER: Very probably. 
192,"FINCH: Very well. But while we're waiting for this Doctor of yours, you"
193,"will obey my orders. You can have your extra patrols, Brigadier, but my"
194,instructions to them are that any looter who does not surrender
195,immediately will be shot.
196,
197, [Warehouse]
198,
199, (A group of armed soldiers are waiting as the
200,Doctor and Sarah drive in and get out of the Land Rover.) 
201,NORTON: Halt! Place your hands above your head! 
202,(The Corporal in charge fires into the air.) 
203,NORTON: That will be your only warning. Raise your hands! 
204,(The Doctor and Sarah obey.) 
205,DOCTOR: Will you please tell me what's happening? 
206,"NORTON: Over there by the Land Rover. Turn round, lean forward, hands"
207,against the side. 
208,"DOCTOR: Look, will you please tell me what's going on here? "
209,NORTON: Turn round! Search their vehicle. 
210,(Norton frisks the Doctor and Sarah while his patrol find the holdall
211,and a pile of fur coats in the Land Rover.) 
212,"NORTON: You have had a busy day, haven't you?"
213,
214, [Detention centre]
215,
216, (A Sergeant reads out the charges to a man in a
217,denim jacket.) 
218,"DUFFY: Right. You were arrested today, found looting in possession of"
219,"two tape recorders, one radio and a colour television set. You will be"
220,held for military trial. Photographs. 
221,(A soldier takes the man away.) 
222,DUFFY: Next. Names? 
223,"DOCTOR: Now, if I can have a word with someone in authority. "
224,DUFFY: Names. 
225,SARAH: Sarah Jane Smith. 
226,DUFFY: Name? 
227,DOCTOR: Doctor John Smith. No relation. 
228,DUFFY: Age? 
229,SARAH: Twenty three. 
230,DUFFY: Age? 
231,DOCTOR: You'd never believe me. 
232,DUFFY: Offence? 
233,"NORTON: Looting furs, jewels and money. "
234,DUFFY: Right. You'll be held for military trial. Over there for
235,photographs. 
236,SARAH: But why are the military running everything? 
237,"DOCTOR: Come on, Sarah. Let's go and have our photos taken, shall we? "
238,(They cross the room.) 
239,"DOCTOR: Oh, deary me, that's very antiquated equipment, isn't it? I'll"
240,think you'll find that the right is my best side. 
241,NORTON: Shut up and hold that in front of you. 
242,"DOCTOR: Oh, all right. "
243,(Prisoner 177781 smiles for his mug shots.) 
244,NORTON: Now you. 
245,SARAH: Thank you. 
246,( Prisoner 177782 also smiles for her pictures.) 
247,"DOCTOR: Now, what about one of both of us? Come and join in. "
248,NORTON: Over there. Down there. On the floor. 
249,"DOCTOR: No, we'd rather stand, if you don't mind. "
250,NORTON: Sit down! 
251,(Sarah nods towards something behind them.) 
252,DOCTOR: Oh! What a good idea. There we are. 
253,(The Doctor takes a couple of folding chairs from the pile.) 
254,DOCTOR: That's better. 
255,NORTON: Keep them quiet. 
256,PRIVATE: All right. 
257,SARAH: What do we do now? 
258,DOCTOR: Wait for the officer to turn up. Maybe we can get some sense
259,out of him. 
260,SARAH: What on Earth's going on? What's happening? 
261,DOCTOR: I've no idea. Maybe this gentleman here can enlighten us. 
262,(The man in the denim jacket is sitting on the floor.) 
263,"DOCTOR: How do you do, sir? I'm the Doctor. "
264,LODGE: You've got nothing to be cheerful about. There's no judge and
265,"jury now, mate. Military law. "
266,SARAH: But why? 
267,LODGE: Where you been? Because of the monsters!
268,
269, [Road]
270,
271,(A three story building explodes as something very
272,large with equally big teeth smashes through it. A soldier reports in
273,on his R/T.) 
274,"SOLDIER: It's coming straight for us, sir, and we're trapped. Same as"
275,usual. The bullets won't do any good. We're going to try and turn it
276,with the grenades. 
277,(T Rex doesn't seem too happy with the big bang.) 
278,"SOLDIER: It's working, sir. Seems to be moving off."
279,
280, [UNIT HQ - temporary]
281,
282,(Reception is terrible.) 
283,"SOLDIER : It's running away now, sir. North north west in the"
284,direction of 
285,"OGDEN: It's gone again. Happens every time, sir. Whenever we get a"
286,"sight, the R/T reception's diabolical. "
287,"BRIGADIER: Yes, I'm well aware of that. "
288,"BENTON: Yes, sir, but there must be some connection. Whatever's causing"
289,the monsters is causing the interference. 
290,"BRIGADIER: The thought had occurred to me, Benton, but since we don't"
291,know what's causing either we're not really much the wiser. 
292,(A soldier puts a folder on a desk and the Brigadier picks it up.) 
293,BRIGADIER: Latest batch of looters. File them. 
294,"BENTON: Right, sir. "
295,BRIGADIER: Huh. Another message from the government here telling us to
296,make sure that law and order's maintained in the evacuative zone. They
297,seem to have forgotten the main problem. 
298,"BENTON: Yes, well, it's all right for them, stuck safe and sound up in"
299,Harrogate. What a scruffy looking bunch we've got here. 
300,SOLDIER: You can say that again. 
301,"BENTON: Hey, sir, look. "
302,BRIGADIER: What? 
303,(Benton hands over a mug shot.) 
304,"BRIGADIER: Good grief. Looter charged with stolen furs, jewellery and"
305,money. 
306,"BENTON: And there's one of that journalist girl, Sarah Jane Smith. "
307,"BRIGADIER: They're being held at number five reception centre. Ogden,"
308,"number five reception. Get them on the R/T, will you? "
309,"OGDEN: No good, sir. "
310,"BRIGADIER: Oh, all right, I'll go there myself. Get my jeep, will you? "
311,"BENTON: There's a planning conference for General Finch in ten minutes,"
312,"sir. Well, shall I go? "
313,"BRIGADIER: No, you'd better stay here. Send a dispatch rider and get"
314,them brought here as quickly as possible. 
315,"BENTON: Right, sir. "
316,BRIGADIER: Typical. Absolutely typical. What is the man playing at?
317,
318, [Detention centre]
319,
320, (The Doctor appears to be asleep. Their guard is
321,reading a magazine. Lodge glances at him then Sarah.) 
322,LODGE: Psst. 
323,SARAH: Mmm? 
324,(She nudges the Doctor.) 
325,DOCTOR: Yes? 
326,LODGE: (sotto) There's only him. We could make a break for it. 
327,SARAH: (sotto) And get ourselves shot? 
328,LODGE: (sotto) You know what they'll do with us? 
329,DOCTOR: (sotto) No. Do you? 
330,"LODGE: (sotto) Twenty years in some detention camp. Look, with a bit of"
331,luck we could get out of here. What do you reckon? 
332,"DOCTOR: (sotto) No, thank you very much. "
333,(The officer has arrived.) 
334,"DUFFY: Right, on your feet! Prisoners, forward. "
335,"DUFFY: Prisoners numbers one seven double seven eight oh, one seven"
336,"double seven eight one and one seven double seven eight two, sir. "
337,"DOCTOR: We do have names, you know. "
338,"SHEARS: Just these three, Sergeant? "
339,"DUFFY: Yes, sir. "
340,"SHEARS: All right, let's get on with it. I have to be back at HQ in ten"
341,minutes time. Evidence? 
342,"DUFFY: Seven eight oh, Lodge, sir. Caught in possession of two tape"
343,"recorders, one radio and a colour television set. "
344,SHEARS: Anything to say? 
345,"LODGE: Well, yes. I, er, found the stuff, see. I was going to hand it"
346,in. 
347,SHEARS: You've been found guilty of looting. Under the authority vested
348,"in me by the Emergency Powers Act, I'm issuing an order that you be"
349,held in a military detention centre for the duration of the emergency.
350,You'll be handed over to the civil authorities for trial and sentence
351,when time permits. Next! 
352,"DUFFY: Seven eight one and seven eight two were caught together, sir,"
353,"in possession of furs, jewels and stolen money. "
354,SHEARS: Were they now? 
355,"DUFFY: Yes, sir. "
356,SHEARS: Anything to say? 
357,SARAH: We found those things after someone else had stolen them. 
358,SHEARS: And you were going hand them in? 
359,SARAH: Yes. 
360,SHEARS: Very original. You've been found guilty of looting. 
361,DOCTOR: Now just one moment. 
362,"DUFFY: Hey, keep quiet. "
363,"SHEARS: Well, what is it? "
364,"DOCTOR: Sir, I am the scientific advisor to UNIT, and I demand to be"
365,put in immediate touch with Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart. 
366,SHEARS: I suppose he's an old friend of yours? 
367,"DOCTOR: Yes, as a matter of fact he is. "
368,SHEARS: How very interesting. You've been found guilty of looting.
369,"Under the authority vested in me by the Emergency Powers Act, I'm"
370,issuing an order that you'll be held in a military detention centre for
371,the duration of the emergency. You will be handed over to the civil
372,authorities for trial and sentence when time permits. Put them on the
373,"next transport for detention centre, will you? "
374,DUFFY: Sir. 
375,SHEARS: I must be off. 
376,DUFFY: Attention! 
377,"SHEARS: Carry on, Sergeant. "
378,(Shears leaves.) 
379,"DUFFY: Right, back over there. "
380,LODGE: See? I told you. Stuck in a detention camp for months. In
381,prison. 
382,"SARAH: What are we going to do, Doctor? Nobody will listen to us. "
383,"DOCTOR: (sotto) Tell me, my friend. What was that idea that you had"
384,about escaping? 
385,"LODGE: (sotto) Well, there's three of us. We could jump him. "
386,"DOCTOR: (sotto) Oh, I think we can be a bit more original than that,"
387,can't we? 
388,"LODGE: (sotto) So what do we do, then? "
389,DOCTOR: (sotto) We have a fight. 
390,LODGE: Eh? 
391,"DOCTOR: You're the nark, aren't ya? It was you wot grassed on us! "
392,LODGE: I never grassed in my life! 
393,"DOCTOR: Yes, you did. Come on! On your feet! Come on, up! "
394,"LODGE: All right then, you great dressed up twit, you asked for it! "
395,(The Doctor blocks the punch.) 
396,DOCTOR: (sotto) Steady. 
397,(They exchange blows then Lodge starts to throttle the Doctor.) 
398,"SARAH: Guard, stop them! You have to stop them! "
399,SOLDIER: Break it up! Break it up! 
400,(The Doctor grabs the soldier with a nerve pinch to the back of the
401,"neck, and he collapses. Lodge takes his weapon.) "
402,LODGE: What did you do? 
403,"DOCTOR: Never mind that now. Come on, let's get out of here. "
404,"LODGE: Ah, no, not you. You go that way. "
405,SARAH: But we'll run straight into the soldiers. 
406,"LODGE: Yeah, and while they're busy with you, I'll get away. "
407,"DOCTOR: Oh, so much for honour amongst thieves. Hai! "
408,(The Doctor kicks the weapon out of Lodge's hands and throws him onto
409,the stage.) 
410,"DOCTOR: Come on, quick, out of here! Come on!"
411,
412, [Outside the Detention centre]
413,
414, (The building looks like a school or church hall.
415,There is a Land Rover parked by a gate in the wall. They get in.) 
416,SARAH: What are you looking for? 
417,DOCTOR: A piece of wire to jump the ignition. I'll try in the back. 
418,(The Doctor gets out and sees a weapon pointed at him.) 
419,NORTON: Ready for the detention centre?
420,
421, [Land Rover]
422,
423, (The Doctor and Sarah are handcuffed to each other
424,in the back as they are driven through leafy suburbia.) 
425,"SARAH: Honestly, Doctor. "
426,DOCTOR: And how was I to know it was detention centre transport? 
427,"SARAH: Oh well, I can see us being locked up for months. Sewing mail"
428,"bags probably. I mean, let's face it. Nobody's listened to us so far. "
429,(The Land Rover stops suddenly. They peer out of the back to see T Rex
430,showing off his big teeth.) 
431, Part Two
432,
433, [Workshop]
434,
435, (As two soldiers run forward to shoot at the
436,"dinosaur, the Doctor and Sarah creep out of the back and run for it."
437,They arrive gasping at a garage workshop and slam the doors behind
438,them.) 
439,SARAH: That thing. What was it? 
440,DOCTOR: A Tyrannosaurus Rex. The largest and fiercest predator of all
441,time. 
442,"SARAH: But, but those things died out millions of years ago. "
443,"DOCTOR: Yes, sixty five million years ago, to be precise. "
444,(The Doctor pulls Sarah to the workbench.) 
445,SARAH: What? 
446,(The Doctor looks through the tools as someone watches from the
447,"shadows. Outside, the grenades have finally made the T Rex back off.)"
448,
449, [Land Rover]
450,
451, SOLDIER 2: They've gone! 
452,SOLDIER 3: Oh no!
453,
454, [Workshop] 
455, (The Doctor is trying to pick Sarah's handcuffs
456,with a small screwdriver.) 
457,SARAH: Ow! 
458,DOCTOR: Sorry. 
459,(He finally succeeds.) 
460,"DOCTOR: There we are. Right, now let's review the situation. A"
461,prehistoric monster's turned up in central London. 
462,"SARAH: Well, how how do you know it's only central London? "
463,"DOCTOR: Because those soldiers were talking about the central zone,"
464,weren't they. 
465,SARAH: But where did that monster come from? 
466,"DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Sarah. "
467,"SARAH: Suppose suppose there was an egg, buried in the ground"
468,"somewhere, and somehow or other it hatched out? "
469,"DOCTOR: What, producing a sweet little baby monster? "
470,"SARAH: Yes. Ah. No. No, how would it grow to that size without anyone"
471,noticing. 
472,DOCTOR: Perhaps somebody kept it as a pet and turned it out when it got
473,too big to feed. 
474,SARAH: Oh. 
475,"DOCTOR: Anyway, aren't you forgetting that pterodactyl that attacked us"
476,in the warehouse? 
477,"SARAH: I suppose you've got the explanation, then. "
478,"DOCTOR: Yes, as a matter of fact, I think I have. "
479,(A man runs for the door.) 
480,DOCTOR: Hello? Who are you? 
481,"PEASANT: Back! Back, accursed wizard! "
482,"DOCTOR: Wizard? I'm no wizard, I assure you. You've got no need to be"
483,frightened of me. 
484,(The man produces a knife.) 
485,"SARAH: Doctor, be careful. "
486,DOCTOR: How did you get here? 
487,PEASANT: The witch. She's cast a spell on me. I'll tell the priest and
488,have her burned! 
489,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, of course. Look, do you know what year it is? "
490,SARAH: What's the name of the King? 
491,"PEASANT: Well, Richard, of course. But he's in the Holy Land. John"
492,"rules now. Look, take the curse off me, wizard. Send me home. "
493,DOCTOR: I only wish I could. 
494,PEASANT: Send me home. Send me home or you die! 
495,DOCTOR: I'm afraid I don't have that power. 
496,"(The man lunges at the Doctor. Sarah grabs him from behind, then a"
497,sound fills the workshop and she lets the man go. He moves back to near
498,the door and disappears.) 
499,SARAH: What happened? He was going to kill you. 
500,DOCTOR: Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating. That was a time eddy. For
501,"a moment there, time went backwards. "
502,(A vehicle pulls up outside.) 
503,SARAH: Doctor. 
504,(Sarah looks out through the doorway.) 
505,SARAH: Soldiers. they're searching. They're coming nearer! 
506,DOCTOR: Can you bolt that door? 
507,SARAH: No! 
508,DOCTOR: Hide. 
509,"(They stand either side of the door. It opens, and the Doctor is about"
510,to give the person entering a karate chop when he sees who it is.) 
511,DOCTOR: Hai! Brigadier. 
512,"BRIGADIER: What do you think you're doing, Doctor?"
513,
514, [UNIT HQ - temporary]
515,
516," BRIGADIER: It all started just after you, Doctor,"
517,"and as we later discovered, Miss Smith, went off on your last little"
518,jaunt. 
519,"SARAH: We were helping you, and if you knew what we'd been through. "
520,"BRIGADIER: Yes, some other time, Miss Smith, if you don't mind? "
521,BRIGADIER: A variety of prehistoric reptiles began to appear in the
522,"central London area. There was, as you can imagine, considerable panic"
523,and some loss of life. 
524,(The Doctor finds a bag of sugar and puts four heaped teaspoons into
525,his mug of tea.) 
526,DOCTOR: How many of these things have been seen up to now? 
527,"BRIGADIER: Well, the pins record the sighting "
528,"BENTON: It's a colour code, Doctor. We're using red pins for"
529,"Tyrannosaurus, blue for Triceratops, green for the Stegosaurus and pink"
530,for your actual Pterodactyl. 
531,"BRIGADIER: Thank you, Benton. We soon realised that these creatures"
532,only appear in central London. We therefore evacuated the entire area
533,"and set up this temporary HQ, which as you can see from the map, is on"
534,the periphery of the zone. 
535,SARAH: You've evacuated everybody? 
536,BRIGADIER: Eight million people. I'm happy to say the evacuation was
537,carried out without a hitch. Of course the criminal element has been
538,taking advantage of the situation. 
539,"SARAH: Looters, you mean. Like those people we met. "
540,"BRIGADIER: There's been quite a bit of that, I'm afraid. But we're"
541,keeping them under control. 
542,"DOCTOR: Well, that's absolutely marvellous, Brigadier. Now what're you"
543,doing about the real problem? 
544,"BRIGADIER: Well, as soon as these creatures appear, we make sure that"
545,"they're contained within the evacuated zone, and don't wander off into"
546,populated areas. 
547,"DOCTOR: Well, having contained them, what do you do then? "
548,"BRIGADIER: Ah, well, that's where you come in, Doctor. So far we've"
549,"absolutely no idea where they're coming from or come to that, where"
550,they go. 
551,SARAH: Where they go? 
552,"BRIGADIER: Yes, that's one of the few good things about the entire"
553,"situation. According to my patrols, they seem to vanish. Just"
554,"disappear. No one sees them come, no one sees them go. "
555,"SARAH: But things that size, where could they go? "
556,"DOCTOR: Well, that's pretty obvious, isn't it, Sarah? "
557,SARAH: Hmm? 
558,"DOCTOR: Back where they came from, into the past. "
559,(Finch and Yates enter.) 
560,"FINCH: All right, Brigadier, you can have your extra patrols, but I"
561,"warn you, I shall expect results. "
562,"DOCTOR: Mike, my dear fellow, how are you? Good to see you again. "
563,YATES: Doctor. 
564,FINCH: Who's this? 
565,"BRIGADIER: Sir, this is the Doctor, our scientific advisor. "
566,"FINCH: Oh. We've been waiting for you, you know. May I ask where you've"
567,been? 
568,DOCTOR: Certainly. 
569,FINCH: Well? 
570,DOCTOR: You can ask but I don't guarantee that you'll get a reply. 
571,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, this is General Finch. He's in overall charge of the"
572,entire operation. 
573,"DOCTOR: Oh, is he indeed. How do you do, General. "
574,"BRIGADIER: The Doctor's already come up with a most interesting theory,"
575,sir. He believes these creatures are coming to us from the past. 
576,FINCH: Huh. Very interesting. How? 
577,"BRIGADIER: Yes, um. Doctor? "
578,DOCTOR: Somebody or something is operating a temporal displacement on a
579,very vast scale. 
580,FINCH: Never mind your scientific gobbledygook. 
581,"DOCTOR: The creatures are being brought from the past into the present,"
582,"General, staying here for a while and then returning to their own time."
583,
584,FINCH: Rubbish! 
585,DOCTOR: I take it then that you have a better theory. 
586,FINCH: Yes. Some mad scientist fellow has been secretly breeding these
587,things. Now they've all got away. 
588,"SARAH: Ah, no, General, now I thought that, but if you think about it "
589,FINCH: Who's this? 
590,SARAH: Oh. Sarah Jane Smith. How do you do? 
591,FINCH: (to Yates) Civilians are not allowed in this zone. Have her
592,evacuated immediately. 
593,"DOCTOR: Er, Miss Smith is presently acting as my assistant, General."
594,"You were saying, my dear? "
595,SARAH: We have just met a man from the past. A peasant from the age of
596,"King John. No, honestly, General, it's true. "
597,FINCH: I'm not staying here to listen to this rubbish. 
598,"YATES: I think you'll find it is worth listening to the Doctor, sir."
599,He's given us a great deal of help in the past. 
600,"OGDEN: Okay, out. Sergeant? Another sighting. "
601,"BENTON: Oh, thank you, Ogden. "
602,"BRIGADIER: Where is it, Benton? "
603,"BENTON: Section five, sir. Somewhere here. "
604,FINCH: Send for the artillery right away. We shall need field guns. 
605,BRIGADIER: Sir. 
606,"DOCTOR: You'll do no such thing, Brigadier. "
607,FINCH: I'll thank you to stop interfering 
608,"DOCTOR: General, we need to study this creature, not shoot at it. How"
609,"much do you think we'll learn from a dead dinosaur? Come on, Brigadier."
610,I want you to take me down there right away.
611,
612, [Yard]
613,
614," BRIGADIER: All right, where is it? "
615,"CORPORAL: It's behind that building, sir. I've put an observer up on"
616,the roof keeping track of it. 
617,(The man on the roof gestures.) 
618,"CORPORAL: It's coming this way, sir! "
619,"DOCTOR: Good grief! It's a Stegosaurus. What a splendid specimen. No,"
620,"no, don't shoot. I want to take a good look at it. "
621,"BRIGADIER: Be careful, Doctor! "
622,"DOCTOR: Don't worry, Brigadier, it's a vegetarian."
623,
624, [UNIT HQ - temporary]
625,
626," YATES: Well, after all that business in Wales with"
627,"the giant maggots, I had to have a spot of leave. Suppose it was a"
628,"reaction, really. "
629,"SARAH: Oh, I'm not surprised. "
630,"YATES: As soon as I get back, of course, all this business blows up. "
631,SARAH: It's weird seeing London like this. All those deserted streets. 
632,YATES: I rather like it. 
633,"BENTON: Excuse me, sir. "
634,"OGDEN: Trap two, over. "
635,YATES: Have you noticed the air? 
636,SARAH: Hmm? 
637,"YATES: It's clean. No cars, no people. Do you know yesterday I saw a"
638,fox in Piccadilly? 
639,SARAH: And nightingales in Berkeley Square? 
640,YATES: It's not impossible. 
641,"SARAH: No. No, I like London the way it was, traffic jams and all. "
642,"YATES: Yes, I expect you're right. "
643,"OGDEN: Okay. Out. Sir? Message from spotter control, sir. The Doctor"
644,"and the Brigadier have arrived. Oh, the Doctor now has the monster"
645,"under close observation, Miss."
646,
647, [Yard]
648,
649," DOCTOR: Right, we'll need some rope and a strong"
650,net. 
651,BRIGADIER: You intend to catch it? 
652,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. I want to observe it under laboratory"
653,conditions. Have you got any rope? 
654,"CORPORAL: We've got some towing rope, sir. "
655,BRIGADIER: You're going to tie it up? 
656,"DOCTOR: That's my intention, yes. "
657,"BRIGADIER: All right, Corporal, carry on. "
658,"CORPORAL: Right, sir. "
659,"DOCTOR: That creature has an amiable disposition, Brigadier, and a"
660,brain about the size of a walnut. I think we should be able to deal
661,"with it, don't you? "
662,"CORPORAL: The rope, sir. "
663,"BRIGADIER: Well, of all the lunatic schemes. All right then, let's give"
664,him a hand. 
665,"(The sound starts up, everyone stands still then moves backwards except"
666,"the Doctor, and steggy fades away.) "
667,BRIGADIER: It's gone! 
668,"CORPORAL: It must have gone round the corner, sir. Should we go after"
669,it? 
670,"DOCTOR: It's all right, Corporal, don't bother."
671,
672, [UNIT HQ - temporary]
673,
674, FINCH: Disappeared? You mean you disappeared when
675,it got too close? 
676,"DOCTOR: No, sir. "
677,FINCH: Then what happened? How did you lose it? 
678,"BRIGADIER: I've no idea, sir. One moment we were discussing the"
679,"possibility of capturing it and the next, it had gone. "
680,"FINCH: Vanished into thin air, I suppose? "
681,"DOCTOR: Yes, General Finch. That is precisely what happened. "
682,FINCH: Did you see this happen? 
683,"BRIGADIER: Well, not exactly. "
684,"DOCTOR: The Brigadier and his men couldn't see what happened, sir. They"
685,were temporally affected by a time eddy. 
686,FINCH: A what? 
687,"DOCTOR: Whenever a creature appears or disappears, the temporal"
688,displacement causes a localised distortion in time. Now as far as the
689,"people in the immediate vicinity were concerned, time literally runs"
690,"backwards, so naturally, they'd have no recollection of what had"
691,occurred. 
692,"FINCH: The man's mad. Temporal displacement. Time travel is impossible,"
693,we all know that. 
694,"SARAH: I've travelled through time, General. The Doctor knows what he's"
695,talking about. 
696,"BRIGADIER: Sir, suppose we accept the Doctor's theory, for the purposes"
697,of discussion. What happens next? 
698,"DOCTOR: Well, we must capture one of the creatures. "
699,FINCH: And what good will that do? 
700,"DOCTOR: Well, I think a study of one of these dinosaurs, General, might"
701,lead me to the source. 
702,"YATES: It couldn't be a natural phenomenon, could it, Doctor? Something"
703,going wrong with time? 
704,DOCTOR: Then why are they contained to this one area? These giant
705,"reptiles existed all over the planet, Mike. They'd be popping up"
706,everywhere. 
707,"SARAH: Doctor, what about that man we saw in the garage? "
708,"DOCTOR: Well, I think he was an accident. Whoever's responsible for"
709,"these apparitions, General, is operating from somewhere in this area. "
710,YATES: You're overlooking one thing. This whole zone has been
711,evacuated. 
712,"DOCTOR: Well, that's where you're wrong, Mike. Someone's there and"
713,whoever it is is using vast amounts of power. 
714,BRIGADIER: But all power's been cut off in central London. Just minimal
715,emergency supplies. 
716,"DOCTOR: Then someone, Brigadier, is making their own."

729,sequence has been carefully calculated. 
730,WHITAKER: How can I be expected to work on the main project when I have
731,these constant distractions? 
732,"BUTLER: Well, these distractions have emptied London for us. We must"
733,keep the authorities off balance.

739,(The Doctor is working at a bench in what appears
740,to be a school biology room. There is a diagram of the human eye on the
741,blackboard.) 
742,YATES: Do you really think you can knock out a dinosaur with that
743,thing? 
744,DOCTOR: Naturally. 
745,YATES: How? 
746,DOCTOR: By a simple molecular reaction. 
747,YATES: I see. 
748,DOCTOR: I doubt it. The principle hasn't really been developed on Earth
749,yet. 
750,YATES: What exactly will it do? 
751,"DOCTOR: Well, it'll temporarily neutralise creatures' brain cells. "
752,YATES: I didn't think these creatures had any brains? 
753,"DOCTOR: All animals have brains of some sort, Mike. "
754,YATES: What'll happen to the dinosaur when you switch this thing on? 
755,DOCTOR: It'll faint. 
756,YATES: And what will you do with your monster when you've got it? 
757,DOCTOR: Surround it with an electrical field and wait for it to
758,disappear. 
759,YATES: And what'll that tell you? 
760,"DOCTOR: Well, the source of the power that is moving these creatures"
761,through time. 
762,YATES: Will you get an accurate fix? 
763,"DOCTOR: Mmm, pretty accurate. Enough for the Brigadier and his merry"
764,men to round up the guilty parties anyway. 
765,"YATES: Jolly good, Doctor. Well, I think I'd better let you get on with"
766,it. 
767,"DOCTOR: Yes, that would be helpful. "
768,(Sarah enters.) 
769,"SARAH: Doctor? Listen, Doctor, that General Finch is being impossible."
770,What are you making? 
771,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. Look, ask Captain Yates, there's a good girl. "

777,"DOCTOR: Hmm? Yes, yes, anything you like. "
778,SARAH: There you are. 
779,"YATES: Tell you what, I'll fix you up with a temporary pass, but just"
780,stay out of sight of General Finch. Excuse me. 
781,"SARAH: Yes, thank you. "

783,SARAH: What did you say that thing is? 
784,DOCTOR: I didn't. 
785,SARAH: Can I help at all? 
786,DOCTOR: No. 
787,"SARAH: Oh, come on, Doctor. I'm supposed to be your assistant. There"
788,must be something I can do.

835, WHITAKER: That's absolute nonsense. There's no way
836,he can find us. 
837,"YATES: If the Doctor says he can do it, I believe him. He's probably"
838,the greatest scientist on this planet. 
839,WHITAKER: That is a matter of opinion. 
840,BUTLER: You realise what'll happen if he's right? It'll be the end of
841,Operation Golden Age. Everything we've planned will be ruined. 
842,"WHITAKER: Very well, if he's such a danger to us, you will have to deal"
843,with him. 
844,YATES: How? 
845,"WHITAKER: Well, you're the soldier. "
846,"YATES: I'll do nothing to harm the Doctor, nor will I allow him to be"
847,"harmed. If we descend to that sort of thing, we're no better than the"
848,society we intend to replace. 
849,"WHITAKER: Captain Yates, I respect your principles but if the Doctor"
850,"succeeds in capturing a dinosaur, then the whole project may be"
851,jeopardised. 
852,BUTLER: But what can we do? 
853,WHITAKER: You must sabotage the Doctor's stun gun.
854,

863,patrols are on maximum alert. 
864,"GROVER: Tell me, Doctor, have you any theories as to why all this is"

866,DOCTOR: Yes. I believe these dinosaurs are being used purely as a
867,terror weapon in order to clear central London. 
868,GROVER: But why? 
869,"DOCTOR: Well, presumably, so that some vast project can be carried out."
870,Something for which people will get in the way. 
871,"GROVER: Yes, but why London? Who not the Yorkshire Moors or the"
872,Highlands of Scotland? 
873,"DOCTOR: Why, indeed. Well, there must be some overriding reason. There"
874,must be something that they need that's only available to them here.

907,"(Collins reverses Yates' Land Rover out of the way, and Yates joins the"
908,Doctor.) 
909,"BRIGADIER: Are you sure this is the kind you want, Doctor? It's rather"
910,large. 
911,"DOCTOR: The bigger, the better, Brigadier. "
912,"BRIGADIER: Really, why is that? "
913,"DOCTOR: The larger the mass, the greater the temporal displacement for"
914,my instruments to measure. 
915,"YATES: Doctor, suppose this gadget of yours doesn't work? "
916,"DOCTOR: Then I shall simply turn round and come back, feeling rather"
917,foolish. 
918,YATES: But isn't that thing dangerous? 
919,"DOCTOR: Not unless it's roused, Captain Yates. Mind you, I wouldn't"
920,like to try it on a Tyrannosaurus Rex. 
921,"BRIGADIER: Right, bring the Doctor's, that thing in my jeep. Bring it"
922,over here. 
923,"YATES: It's all right, Corporal. I'll get it. "
924,CORPORAL: Sir. 
925,"(Yates runs back to the vehicle. He glances to see no one is looking,"
926,and fixes the magnetic metal disc to the barrels.) 
927,BRIGADIER: We'll be ready with covering fire. 
928,DOCTOR: That won't be necessary. 
929,"BRIGADIER: Just in case, Doctor. Stand by! "
930,(Yates brings the stun gun and power pack to the Doctor. The soldiers
931,set up a grenade launcher. The Doctor takes up a forward position and
932,aims the stun gun at the apatosaurus. Nothing happens. He checks the
933,settings and connections and power levels and tries again. Still
934,"nothing. There is a time eddy, the apatosaurus disappears. Behind him,"
935,a T Rex roars. The Doctor tries the stun gun again.) 
936,BRIGADIER: Fire! 
937, Part Three
938,
939, [Power station]
940,
941, (The grenade explodes between the Doctor and the T
942,Rex. The Doctor starts to run but a second grenade burst knocks him off
943,"his feet. He staggers away, leaving the stun gun.) "
944,BRIGADIER: Fire! 
945,(Yates draws his pistol and runs to help the Doctor.) 
946,BRIGADIER: Cease fire! Captain Yates! 
947,"(Yates reaches for the stun gun, removes the disc and fires directly up"
948,"at the giant carnivore. Its eyes roll up, and Yates hurries over to the"
949,"Doctor before it crashes to the ground, unconscious.)"
950,
951, [Control room]
952,
953, YATES: You tried to murder him! You deliberately
954,materialised a savage monster knowing it would attack him! 
955,BUTLER: An unavoidable mistake. 
956,"YATES: Oh, that was no mistake. I warned you I wouldn't have the Doctor"
957,harmed. 
958,"BUTLER: Well, you sabotaged the stun gun. "
959,"YATES: I agreed to delay his experiments, not to kill him. "
960,"BUTLER: Captain Yates, may I remind you, you were the one who said he"
961,was such a danger to us. 
962,"YATES: Let me tell him everything, explain to him what we're trying to"
963,do? He'll be sympathetic. He might even help us. 
964,"WHITAKER: No, that's out of the question. "
965,"BUTLER: If he doesn't agree with us, what happens then? "
966,YATES: There's no need to kill him. 
967,WHITAKER: He must be delayed. Now once the temporal energy has
968,"dispersed, the creature will return to its own time and the Doctor's"
969,"instruments will lead him straight to us. Now, what stage has he"
970,reached? 
971,YATES: They've taken the creature to a hangar on the fringe of the
972,zone. 
973,"BUTLER: Then you'd better get over there, Captain Yates. "
974,YATES: To do what? 
975,"BUTLER: More sabotage, I'm afraid. All you have to do is to ensure that"
976,the Doctor's instruments don't function. The creature will return to
977,"its own time, the Doctor will learn nothing, and we shall have the"
978,delay we need. 
979,YATES: And the Doctor won't be harmed? 
980,WHITAKER: Of course not. 
981,YATES: I'll do what I can. 
982,(Yates leaves.) 
983,WHITAKER: I'm not satisfied with that young man's loyalty. He's far too
984,concerned about this precious Doctor of his.
985,
986, [Hangar office]
987,
988, (The Doctor checks that T Rex is secure in its
989,"chains in the main hangar, and surrounded by detectors.) "
990,"BRIGADIER: All set up then, Doctor? "
991,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. Mind you, that creature isn't what I wanted at"
992,all. What I really wanted was a brontosaurus. 
993,BRIGADIER: What's the difference? 
994,"DOCTOR: The difference, Brigadier, is that the brontosaurus is a placid"
995,"vegetarian, whereas the Tyrannosaurus is the largest and fiercest flesh"
996,eater ever known on your planet. 
997,"SARAH: It will stay asleep, won't it, Doctor? "
998,"DOCTOR: Yes, for a while. "
999,"BRIGADIER: Don't you worry, Miss Smith, those chains will hold him"
1000,"down. Well, Doctor, now what do we do? "
1001,DOCTOR: We sit back and wait for it to dematerialise. 
1002,SARAH: Then perhaps I can have your attention. 
1003,"DOCTOR: Carry on, Sarah, I'm all ears. "
1004,"SARAH: Well, I've been checking up into this whole question of time"
1005,travel. 
1006,DOCTOR: You should have come to me. I know all about time travel. 
1007,"SARAH: Ah, I know you know about it, but what I'm interested in,"
1008,"Doctor, is other people who know about it. "
1009,"DOCTOR: Oh, are there any? "
1010,"SARAH: Oh, one or two have dabbled. "
1011,"DOCTOR: Oh, fascinating. The trouble is the Blinovitch limitation"
1012,effect. If they could overcome that their problem's 
1013,SARAH: I think someone has. 
1014,"DOCTOR: What, on this planet? "
1015,"SARAH: This is the only one I've been able to check up on, Doctor. "
1016,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, of course. Er, let's see now, there was this this"
1017,"Chinese scientist called Chun Sen. Oh, hang about, he hasn't been born"
1018,"yet, has he. "
1019,"SARAH: Quite, but there is a man called Whitaker. Now he's the leading"
1020,scientist in this field. 
1021,BRIGADIER: Whitaker. That name rings a bell. 
1022,SARAH: He claimed to have developed a workable theory of time travel. 
1023,BRIGADIER: I remember. He applied for a big government grant. It was
1024,refused. 
1025,"DOCTOR: Oh, why? "
1026,"SARAH: Whitaker was always an outsider, always mixed up in quarrels"
1027,with other scientists. No one believed his theory would work. 
1028,"BRIGADIER: Yes, that's right. All the government scientific advisors"
1029,said the fellow was a crank. What about him? 
1030,SARAH: He's disappeared. 
1031,DOCTOR: Has he indeed? 
1032,"SARAH: About six months ago, he completely vanished. I checked with my"
1033,newspaper contacts up north. No trace. 
1034,DOCTOR: And you think he could be behind all this? 
1035,"SARAH: Well, it's a possibility. He was a brilliant scientist, and he"
1036,must have been bitterly disappointed when the government refused that
1037,grant. 
1038,"DOCTOR: You could be right, Sarah. It's worth checking up on. "
1039,"BRIGADIER: Yes, I'll get on to it. Intelligence records may have"
1040,something on him. 
1041,"DOCTOR: Yeah, I'd like to see the application for that grant. See the"
1042,man's working papers. 
1043,BRIGADIER: Right. They must be on file somewhere. 
1044,"DOCTOR: Oh, Brigadier, have your fellows brought the Tardis back to"
1045,UNIT HQ for me yet? 
1046,"BRIGADIER: Yes, should be there by now. "
1047,DOCTOR: Could you give me a run down there? 
1048,"BRIGADIER: Yes, of course. "
1049,"DOCTOR: Good, thanks, there's one or two things inside I think I might"
1050,need. 
1051,"SARAH: Oh, what about your little pet out there? "
1052,"DOCTOR: Oh, he'll be all right for a while. You've placed guards? "
1053,BRIGADIER: General Finch has lent me a squad. 
1054,DOCTOR: Good. 
1055,SARAH: But suppose it dematerialises while you're not here? 
1056,DOCTOR: Then my instruments will obtain the necessary readings. Coming?
1057,
1058,"SARAH: Yes, yes. Er, Brigadier? "
1059,BRIGADIER: Mmm? 
1060,SARAH: Can I bring a camera back here with me? 
1061,BRIGADIER: Whatever for? 
1062,"SARAH: Well, for my story. I'm a journalist, remember? You don't think"
1063,I'm going to miss an opportunity like this? 
1064,"BRIGADIER: I am sorry, Miss Smith. This whole affair's under strict"
1065,security black-out. You can take your photographs when the crisis is
1066,passed. 
1067,"SARAH: Oh! When the crisis is passed, there won't be anything to"
1068,photograph. 
1069,"(Everyone leaves. A short time later, Yates enters and looks over the"
1070,monitoring equipment.)
1071,
1072, [Makeshift laboratory] 
1073, BRIGADIER: The Minister has some information for
1074,"you, Doctor, about this elusive fellow Whitaker. "
1075,"DOCTOR: Have you, sir? "
1076,GROVER: I was chairman of the committee that considered his application
1077,for a government grant. 
1078,DOCTOR: So you've seen his working papers? 
1079,"GROVER: Oh, yes, not that I understood them, of course, but my"
1080,scientific colleagues on the committee assured me that they were utter
1081,nonsense. 
1082,DOCTOR: So you don't think that he could be behind what's been
1083,happening here. 
1084,"GROVER: Oh, out of the question. I'm afraid the poor fellow's just a"
1085,harmless crank. 
1086,"SARAH: That's not what I've heard, Minister. According to my sources"
1087,he's a brilliant scientist. 
1088,GROVER: May I ask what are your sources? 
1089,"SARAH: His colleagues at Oxford, the science correspondent of The Times"
1090,and the editor of Nature. 
1091,"GROVER: He may be brilliant in other fields, Miss Smith, but as far as"
1092,"his time travel theory is concerned, I was assured it's worthless."
1093,"Doctor, I understand that you have set up an experiment which may give"
1094,us the answer to all this? 
1095,"DOCTOR: Yeah, well, it's a possibility, Minister, but I can't guarantee"
1096,it. 
1097,GROVER: I'd be very interested to hear about it. 
1098,"BRIGADIER: Well, why don't we go to my office, sir? It'll be more"
1099,comfortable there. 
1100,GROVER: Thank you very much. 
1101,DOCTOR: That's a good idea. 
1102,GROVER: General Finch? 
1103,"FINCH: I must be getting back to HQ, sir. "
1104,"BRIGADIER: This way, sir. "
1105,GROVER: Thank you. 
1106,"(The Brigadier, Doctor and Grover leave.) "
1107,SARAH: Isn't it marvellous. The one real clue to this whole business
1108,and they totally ignore it. 
1109,"FINCH: I'm interested, Miss Smith. Where is this fellow Whitaker? "
1110,"SARAH: Well, that's just it, you see. No one knows. "
1111,FINCH: No one? 
1112,SARAH: He vanished about six months ago. Just upped and left
1113,home. 
1114,"FINCH: Well, people do disappear, change their names, start a new life"
1115,for themselves. 
1116,"SARAH: No, it's too big a coincidence. I'm not going to let go of this."
1117,
1118,FINCH: What can you do? 
1119,SARAH: Keep looking until I find him. I'll make them believe me. The
1120,Brigadier's being completely uncooperative. He wouldn't even let me get
1121,some photographs of that monster they've got chained down. 
1122,"FINCH: Well, you've got a pass, haven't you? "
1123,"SARAH: Oh! I tried! When I got back there, they wouldn't let me in."
1124,Said I had to have a special pass. 
1125,FINCH: Special army pass from my HQ. 
1126,"SARAH: You couldn't give me a pass, could you? I wouldn't publish"
1127,anything until it was all over and I got proper permission. 
1128,"FINCH: I don't carry passes about with me, you know. Look, take this to"
1129,my HQ. 
1130,(Finch writes on a piece of paper.) 
1131,FINCH: See my adjutant. He'll fix you up. 
1132,"SARAH: Oh, that's marvellous! Where is your HQ? "
1133,FINCH: Show this to my driver. He'll take you there. 
1134,"SARAH: Oh, what about you? "
1135,FINCH: I've got one or two things to settle here. 
1136,SARAH: Thank you.
1137,"(Later, while Yates is in the hangar looking at the dinosaur, the"
1138,Doctor and Brigadier return.) 
1139,"DOCTOR: What a charming fellow. You know, it's lucky for you,"
1140,"Brigadier, that somebody with some sense is in charge of this"
1141,operation. 
1142,BRIGADIER: Unfortunately General Finch is in charge of the military
1143,side. 
1144,"DOCTOR: Yes, quite. Where's Sarah? "
1145,BRIGADIER: Maybe General Finch took her out to dinner. 
1146,DOCTOR: Huh! Didn't look like the beginnings of a beautiful friendship
1147,"to me. Oh, by the way, Brigadier? I've got to get down to the hanger."
1148,Could you lend me a jeep? 
1149,BRIGADIER: Yes. 
1150,(The Brigadier makes a telephone call.) 
1151,"BRIGADIER: Brigadier speaking. Lay on a jeep for the Doctor, will you?"
1152,"Oh, and did you see Miss Smith leave here? Oh, thank you. She went off"
1153,in the General's car. 
1154,DOCTOR: Oh.
1155,  [Hangar office]
1156,
1157, (Sarah has got her camera and takes a picture of T
1158,Rex through the observation window. The automatic flash goes off. More
1159,flashes and the dinosaur's eyes flicker. A few more then Sarah decides
1160,on some close ups. She goes into the hangar proper and takes more flash
1161,photographs within arms reach of the monster. As she puts down the
1162,"camera to change the film, T Rex rises up. Sarah screams and runs back"
1163,to the office. The external door is locked. The dinosaur rises onto its
1164,"hind legs, roaring. Meanwhile, the Doctor is driving through"
1165,surburbia.) 
1166,"SARAH: Help! Someone! Open the door! Help! Open the door, for God's"
1167,sake! 
1168,(T Rex uses its tail to batter the wall between it at Sarah. 
1169,SARAH: Help! Can anyone hear me? I can't get out! The door's stuck!
1170,Help me! 
1171,(The tail smashes the window and wall. A piece of timber falls on
1172,"Sarah's head, knocking her out and leaving her with a nasty cut above"
1173,"her eye. A few moments later, the Doctor enters.) "
1174,"DOCTOR: Come on, up! Come on! Come on, get up. That's it! "
1175,(The Doctor drags the groggy Sarah along the side of the buildings
1176,while T Rex smashes the hangar to pieces. He bundles her into the Land
1177,Rover as it comes bursting through the wall.)
1178,
1179, [Makeshift laboratory]
1180,
1181, DOCTOR: It's a nasty bump. Nothing too serious.
1182,How do you feel? 
1183,SARAH: Scared. Do you realise somebody tried to kill me? 
1184,"BRIGADIER: I don't want to seem unsympathetic, Miss Smith, but you have"
1185,only got yourself to blame. 
1186,"SARAH: Well, somebody locked that door so I couldn't get out. "
1187,"DOCTOR: She's right, you know, Brigadier. That door was bolted on the"
1188,outside. 
1189,BRIGADIER: Maybe one of the soldiers didn't realise she was in there. 
1190,(Benton enters with a soldier carrying the Doctor's time eddy
1191,monitoring equipment.) 
1192,"BENTON: Here we are, Doctor. Hasn't been knocked about too much. "
1193,"DOCTOR: Thanks, Sergeant. Put it down there, will you? When the"
1194,"creature vanished, it was still in the electrical forcefield,"
1195,"Brigadier, so we should learn something. "
1196,(Benton has some of the chains that were holding T Rex down. A link has
1197,been cut.) 
1198,"BENTON: We found this, sir. They were all like that. Cut clean through."
1199,
1200,DOCTOR: And this machine's been sabotaged. There's not a single
1201,reading. 
1202,"BRIGADIER: Dismissed! No, not you, Benton. "
1203,(The soldier leaves.) 
1204,"DOCTOR: Well, at least we've learnt something, Brigadier. Somebody"
1205,inside this organisation is working against us. 
1206,"BENTON: Yes, but what I can't understand, sir, is why should anyone"
1207,want to cut those chains? 
1208,DOCTOR: It was a deliberate attempt on Sarah's life. 
1209,BRIGADIER: Why should anybody want to kill her? 
1210,"BENTON: They were probably after you, Doctor. I mean, they expected you"
1211,to go back there. 
1212,"BRIGADIER: Yes, of course, that'll be it. Well, Doctor, any"
1213,suggestions? 
1214,"DOCTOR: Yes, I shall build another detector. "
1215,BRIGADIER: We haven't got to capture another dinosaur? 
1216,"DOCTOR: No, no. No, this time I'm going to try something different. I'm"
1217,going to build a portable device to detect that power source. 
1218,"BRIGADIER: Well, why didn't you do that in the first place? "
1219,"DOCTOR: Because, Brigadier, it cannot be as accurate or as powerful as"
1220,this would have been. But it could give us the general direction. 
1221,SARAH: Doctor? Exactly how much energy would be needed to make these
1222,things appear? 
1223,"DOCTOR: Oh, something like a small nuclear generator. "
1224,SARAH: Then why don't we look for one? 
1225,"BRIGADIER: Miss Smith, that was one of the first things that occurred"
1226,to me. I made a thorough check and I can assure you that there are no
1227,unaccounted for nuclear generators in the central London area. 
1228,"DOCTOR: No, he's right you know, Sarah. It is pretty unlikely, isn't"
1229,"it. Look, why don't you try and get some rest. "
1230,SARAH: All right. 
1231,"DOCTOR: Right, I'll be getting on with it. "
1232,(The Doctor goes into the Tardis.) 
1233,BRIGADIER: I've got yet another planning conference with General Finch.
1234,"Look after Miss Smith, Benton. BENTON: Right, sir. "
1235,(The Brigadier leaves.) 
1236,"BENTON: Well, would you like a cup of tea or anything? "
1237,SARAH: Typical! Run away and play while the grown-ups get on with the
1238,real work. 
1239,BENTON: What do you mean? 
1240,"SARAH: The power's coming from somewhere, right? So there must be an"
1241,independent source. 
1242,"BENTON: I suppose so, but where would you start "
1243,SARAH: So if it is a nuclear reactor it would have been designed and
1244,"assembled, and all that could be traced. There'd be records. "
1245,"BENTON: The Brigadier's checked all that, Miss. If there was anything"
1246,there then he would have found it. 
1247,"SARAH: Well, maybe it was all secret. "
1248,BENTON: Too secret for the Brigadier to know about? 
1249,"SARAH: Yes, why not? Can you get me some transport? "
1250,"BENTON: Oh no, I couldn't do that. "
1251,"SARAH: Oh, they told you to look after me. Come on. "
1252,"BENTON: Well, where do you want to go, and what shall I tell the"
1253,Doctor? 
1254,"SARAH: Well, tell him. Tell him I've gone out to play, hmm? Come on. "
1255,BENTON: (silent) Oh no.
1256,
1257, [Grover's office]
1258,
1259, (Grover opens his own office door.) 
1260,GROVER: Come in! What a pleasant surprise. 
1261,"SARAH: I don't suppose you remember, Minister, but we met briefly at"
1262,UNIT. 
1263,"GROVER: You're far too modest, Miss Smith. Of course I remember. I'm"
1264,sorry you had to find your own way here but I'm down to a skeleton
1265,staff. 
1266,"SARAH: Oh, thank you. "
1267,"GROVER: However, I can offer you a cup of tea. We have our own little"
1268,generator down in the basement. Petrol driven. Can I get you a cup? 
1269,"SARAH: Er, no, not at the moment, thank you. I'm sorry to bother you"
1270,"like this, but you seem to be the only member of the government still"
1271,in London. 
1272,"GROVER: Oh, I am. The rest all shot off to Harrogate, but I told the"
1273,"Prime Minister if I'm in charge, I'm going to stay here, on the spot."
1274,"Now, what can I do for you? "
1275,"SARAH: Well, you know the Doctor's theory about these materialisations?"
1276,They must need a tremendous energy force. 
1277,GROVER: Yes? 
1278,"SARAH: Well, the Doctor said it would have to be something like a"
1279,nuclear generator and that started me remembering something. Wasn't
1280,there a plan once to build underground quarters for the government in
1281,the event of an atomic war? 
1282,"GROVER: Yes, back in the cold war days. Oh, I see what you're getting"
1283,"at. Oh, I don't think any of them were ever built, you know. "
1284,SARAH: Are you sure of that? Each of those places was to have its own
1285,nuclear generator. 
1286,GROVER: That's right. I was a junior backbencher at the time but I
1287,remember plans were made and then shelved when the situation eased. 
1288,"SARAH: But suppose one was built, right here in London. "
1289,"GROVER: That's a very ingenious theory, young lady. What does the"
1290,"Brigadier think about it, or the Doctor? "
1291,SARAH: I'm not telling anyone about it until I can get some evidence. 
1292,"GROVER: I wonder, if it could have happened as you say. "
1293,"SARAH: Oh, I thought if I came to you, you could help me check up on"
1294,it. 
1295,GROVER: And so I can. In there are confidential ministerial files going
1296,back years. Let's take a look. 
1297,SARAH: Thank you.
1298,
1299, [Filing room]
1300,
1301, (Grover shows Sarah into an adjoining room full of
1302,metal filing cabinets. A panel slides across the door when he closes it
1303,"behind him. Sarah reads a clip board on top of a cabinet, which is some"
1304,sort of index.) 
1305,GROVER: Fantastic filing system they have in here. I hardly understand
1306,"it myself, but then of course I've only been Minister for six months. "
1307,SARAH: Could it be this? Top secret construction projects. 
1308,GROVER: I wonder? Number two three nine five. Now that should be over
1309,"here somewhere. No, there's nothing here. This is all about building"
1310,RAF early warning stations in Scotland. 
1311,"SARAH: Well, perhaps one of the other files in the same category? "

1803,MARK: The elders are very dedicated to our cause. They are not going to

1805,SARAH: You mean they'll kill me? Perhaps the time that I spent in
1806,suspended animation has affected my thinking in some ways? Take me back
1807,to the elders. Let me talk to them again.

1820,Minister. 
1821,"DOCTOR: Yes, and no doubt he'll be very pleased to hear it, since he"

2166,GROVER: I don't think that'd be a good idea. You're rather a bad
2167,influence. 
2168,SARAH: What you're doing to those people on there is cruel. They all
2169,believe that they're going to a new world. 
2170,"GROVER: And so they are, but their new world is this one. This world of"
2171,ours swept clean and returned to its early innocence.

2176,purer age.

2182,"understand, you'll want to be with us. If you're ready, Whitaker? "
2183,WHITAKER: Yes. 
2184,"(On the time target monitor, a triceratops appears on a roof across"
2185,"from Westminster Abbey. Near Parliament, a brontosaurus grazes on a"
2186,"tree. A stegosaurus is a couple of streets away from St Paul's, a T Rex"
2187,in front of a Georgian terrace. The Doctor encounters another
2188,brontosaurus by Smithfield Market. He turns around and the time eddy
2189,dumps another T Rex almost on top of him.)

2196,start again. He tries to get into the market proper but the shutters
2197,are locked. Then the predator spots the prey and the two giant lizards
2198,approach each other. T Rex grabs Bronto behind the head and the Doctor
2199,quietly sneaks away. Once out of sight of the fighting dinosaurs he
2200,"runs, only to stop again as an Army Land Rover comes round a corner"
2201,towards him.) 
2202,FINCH: Leave him to me.

2204,BRIGADIER: My prisoner. 
2205,"FINCH: Get out of the way, Brigadier. "
2206,"BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, General, this man is a UNIT prisoner. I'm taking"
2207,him into custody. 
2208,FINCH: Get out of my way! 
2209,BRIGADIER: Benton? 
2210,(Benton stands and aims his semi-automatic at the General.) 
2211,FINCH: You realise this is mutiny? 
2212,"BRIGADIER: There's no question of mutiny, sir. I'm only doing my job. "
2213,FINCH: You'll place this man under close arrest. I'm holding you
2214,responsible for him. 
2215,"(Finch gestures his driver to carry on, and the Land Rover drives"

2226,"BUTLER: Don't worry, you're coming with us. "

2233," BRIGADIER: Doctor, I can get away with holding you"
2234,"here, keeping you out of General Finch's hands, but what you're"
2235,suggesting is mutiny. What the blazes are you doing? 
2236,(Bryson is disconnecting the radio set.) 
2237,"BRYSON: Orders, sir. We're evacuating. All the others have gone. "
2238,BRIGADIER: Whose orders? 
2239,"BRYSON: General Finch, sir. I thought you knew all about it. "
2240,BRIGADIER: This is ridiculous. The whole of London crawling with
2241,monsters and he decides. What about the spotter patrols? 
2242,"BRYSON: They've all gone, sir. Everyone's out of the area. "
2243,BRIGADIER: Good grief! 
2244,"DOCTOR: Look, face up to it, Brigadier. General Finch is involved just"
2245,like Grover. 
2246,BRIGADIER: Is everybody in this conspiracy? 
2247,"DOCTOR: Well, Captain Yates certainly is. "
2248,BRIGADIER: Now that I can't believe. 
2249,"BENTON: Well, he's been pretty odd lately, sir, and he was very keen on"
2250,locking the Doctor up. 
2251,BRIGADIER: He was merely obeying orders. 
2252,"DOCTOR: Hmm. There's a note here from Sarah. There you are. Yes, she"
2253,says she's got positive proof of Grover's involvement and the existence
2254,"of the underground base. Here, see for yourself. "
2255,BRIGADIER: Where the blazes is she? 
2256,"DOCTOR: Er, Private? When was this note left? "
2257,"BRYSON: Very early this morning, sir. She went off with General Finch. "
2258,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
2259,"BRIGADIER: Benton, I want a call to Geneva. "
2260,"BENTON: Right, sir. "
2261,BRIGADIER: I'll get on to International UNIT HQ. They must put pressure
2262,on the government. 
2263,DOCTOR: There's no time for that. 
2264,"BRIGADIER: Well, can you suggest anything else we can do? "
2265,DOCTOR: Yes. Attack that underground base now. 
2266,BRYSON: Sir? 
2267,BRIGADIER: Yeah? 
2268,"BRYSON: Excuse me, sir, but, er, are we evacuating or not? "
2269,BRIGADIER: No. 
2270,"BRYSON: Oh, well, in in that case, sir, what should I do? "
2271,"BRIGADIER: Oh, go and make us all a cup of tea. "
2272,"(Bryson leaves, smiling.) "

2280,"YATES: (into radio.) Would you cancel that call, please? We won't be"
2281,needing it now. 
2282,"BRIGADIER: And what do you think you're doing, Captain Yates? "
2283,"YATES: I'm really sorry, sir. "
2284,(Sarah finally gets the grille off the wall and crawls into the shaft.)
2285,
2286,"DOCTOR: Just what are they going to do, Mike? "
2287,"YATES: They're going to roll back time. The world used to be a cleaner,"
2288,simpler place. It's all become too complicated and corrupt. 
2289,"DOCTOR: Roll back time, I see. Can Whitaker really do that? "
2290,YATES: I believe so. All the preliminary experiments have been
2291,successful. 
2292,DOCTOR: Do you realise what'll happen if they succeed? 
2293,YATES: We shall find ourselves in the golden age. 
2294,"DOCTOR: There never was a golden age, Mike. It's all an illusion. "
2295,YATES: Not this time. We're going to make it come true. 
2296,BRIGADIER: Really. How? 
2297,"DOCTOR: Whitaker's machine creates a protective field, and anyone"
2298,within that field will be unaffected. Anybody outside it will just
2299,cease to exist. 
2300,"YATES: Quite right, Doctor. "
2301,BRIGADIER: Are we inside this protective field? 
2302,"YATES: Perhaps, perhaps not. We're on the very edge of the zone here,"
2303,but it doesn't matter. 
2304,BENTON: You mean it doesn't matter to you not existing? 
2305,YATES: I'm not important. The others'll get there. 
2306,"DOCTOR: Now listen to me, Mike, I "
2307,(Yates turns his weapon on the Doctor.) 
2308,"DOCTOR: Look, I understand your ideals. In many ways I sympathise with"
2309,"them. But this is not the way to go about it, you know? You've got no"
2310,right to take away the existence of generations of people. 
2311,YATES: There's no alternative. 
2312,"DOCTOR: Yes, there is. Take the world that you've got and try and make"
2313,something of it. It's not too late. 
2314,"BRYSON: Oh, I didn't know you were back, Captain Yates, sir. "

2338,SARAH: Somewhere under central London. The whole ship is a fake. 
2339,MARK: Why did they cheat us?

2341,do with altering the course of time.

2359,DOCTOR: That project's going to be activated any moment now and when
2360,"that happens, your reinforcements will vanish. And so will you. "
2361,(Benson hands the Doctor a long coil of nylon rope.) 
2362,BRYSON: Trap two calling all mobile patrols.

2379,world! I went into everything very carefully. I sold my house.

2385,SARAH: Out of the ship. 
2386,RUTH: The girl's mad.

2389,of steps. 
2390,"RUTH: Adam, we must lock her up. "
2391,MARK: I saw her open the airlock. 
2392,RUTH: And I can see that she's very persuasive. 
2393,"MARK: Adam, she's telling us the truth. "
2394,"RUTH: Now listen to me, all of you. This poor girl is unbalanced. She"
2395,should never have been selected. Already she's contaminated one of us.

2402,RUTH: Oh no you don't! 
2403,"SARAH: Look, the people who organised all this, they've got a machine"

2406,RUTH: We must lock her up. Come on.

2452,ourselves. 
2453,ADAM: I think he's got a lot to answer for.

2617,promised you. 
2618,ADAM: You're going to destroy all the civilisations of man. Leaving
2619,"Earth for another planet, that was one thing, but this is evil! "
2620,GROVER: Civilisation has already destroyed man. It's time to make a
2621,"fresh start. If we take the Earth back in time, we can guide man onto a"
2622,better path. 
2623,(The Doctor enters.) 
2624,"SARAH: Oh, Doctor! "
2625,"GROVER: Congratulations, Doctor. You're just in time to be present at"
2626,the most important moment in the world's history. 
2627,"DOCTOR: On the contrary, I'm just in time to prevent an atrocity. "
2628,(The Brigadier and Benton enter with a couple of soldiers.) 
2629,"BRIGADIER: Don't move, any of you! Benton. "
2630,(Whitaker throws off Mark and pulls a lever. A fierce time eddy fills
2631,"the room, freezing everyone. Only the Doctor is unaffected, who pushes"
2632,against the effect to put the lever back where it was. Then the Doctor
2633,goes to another panel and flicks some switches. Grover dives for the
2634,lever again.) 
2635,WHITAKER: No! He's reversed the polarity! 
2636,(Whitaker and Grover fight over the lever.) 
2637,DOCTOR: Keep back! 
2638,"(Grover pulls the lever down again, and he and Whitaker and the console"
2639,disappear.) 
2640,"SARAH: Well, where've they gone? "
2641,DOCTOR: Back to their golden age. And I hope they like it.

2643, [UNIT HQ - temporary]
2644,
2645," BRIGADIER: I still don't understand, Doctor. When"
2646,"Whitaker first pulled that switch, was time reversed or wasn't it? "
2647,DOCTOR: It was for the world outside the forcefield. Your time was just
2648,frozen for a few seconds. 
2649,"SARAH: But what about you? Oh no, don't tell me. You're a Time Lord. "
2650,DOCTOR: Quite! 
2651,SARAH: Poor Grover. 
2652,BRIGADIER: The man was mad. 
2653,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, of course he was mad. But at least he realised the"
2654,"dangers this planet of yours is in, Brigadier. The danger of it"
2655,becoming one vast garbage dump inhabited only by rats. 
2656,"BRIGADIER: It'll never happen, Doctor. "
2657,DOCTOR: It's not the the oil and the filth and the poisonous chemicals
2658,"that are the real cause of pollution, Brigadier. It's simply greed. "
2659,"BRIGADIER: Hmm. Well, I've got work to do, writing my deposition for"
2660,General Finch's court martial. 
2661,"BENTON: Excuse me, sir? What about Captain Yates? "
2662,BRIGADIER: Extended sick leave and a chance to resign quietly. Best I
2663,could do. 
2664,DOCTOR: Poor Mike. 
2665,"BRIGADIER: Come on, Benton. "
2666,BENTON: Still I'll say one thing. Not many Sergeants get the chance to
2667,punch a General on the nose. 
2668,"BRIGADIER: Just don't make a habit of it, Benton. "
2669,(The Brigadier and Benton leave.) 
2670,"DOCTOR: Well, there you are, Sarah. I told you I'd get you home safely,"
2671,didn't I. 
2672,"SARAH: Oh, of all the cheek. "
2673,"DOCTOR: Well, it's not my fault if people get up to no good while we"
2674,were away. 
2675,"SARAH: Alien monsters, robber barons, then dinosaurs. It'll be a long"
2676,time before I get in that Tardis again. 
2677,"DOCTOR: Oh. It's a pity, that. "
2678,SARAH: Why? 
2679,"DOCTOR: Well, er, I was rather thinking of making a trip to Florana. "
2680,SARAH: Where? 
2681,DOCTOR: Florana. Probably one of the most beautiful planets in the
2682,universe. 
2683,"SARAH: Well, count me out. "
2684,DOCTOR: It's always carpeted with perfumed flowers. 
2685,SARAH: I'm not listening. 
2686,DOCTOR: And its seas are as warm milk and the sands as soft as swan's
2687,down. 
2688,"SARAH: No, Doctor. "
2689,DOCTOR: The streams flow with water that are clearer than the clearest
2690,crystal. 
2691,SARAH: No. 
2692,"(Laughing, Sarah puts her hands over her ears.) "
