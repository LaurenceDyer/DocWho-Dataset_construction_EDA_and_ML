22,[Gatwick Airport]
23,
24,(July 20th 1966. A truck comes out of the hangar
25,and drives away with the Tardis secured to the flatbed at the back.
26,The Doctor and Jamie try to give chase but soon lose sight of it.) 
27,DOCTOR: Jamie! 
28,JAMIE: The Tardis! 
29,[Garage]
30,
31,(Next to the hangar is a garage with fuel pumps
32,outside. A man is working at a bench covered in machine parts. A radio
33,is playing music very loudly.) 
34,JAMIE: Doctor. 
35,DOCTOR: Excuse me! 
36,(The man adjusts his hearing aid.) 
37,HALL: Ay? 
38,DOCTOR: I wonder if you can help us? 
39,HALL: My mate likes the wireless turned on at full blast. I have to
40,keep this turned down. 
41,"DOCTOR: Oh, I see. "
42,(Hall turns the wireless off.) 
43,JAMIE: Who's taken the Tardis? 
44,HALL: The what? 
45,DOCTOR: He means the police telephone box. 
46,HALL: He said Tardis or something. 
47,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, Tardis, that's another name for it. "
48,"HALL: Oh, foreign, is he? "
49,"JAMIE: Me, foreign? You're the one that's foreign. I'm Scottish. "
50,"DOCTOR: That's right. Tardis is a is a Gaelic word. Jamie, hush. "
51,JAMIE: It's getting further away all the time. 
52,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know. Well, anyway, it's our property and we've come to"
53,collect it. 
54,"HALL: Oh, you mean the "
55,[Field outside the airport]
56,
57,(A man is listening to this in a field next to the
58,"airport, through a radio transmitter.) "
59,HALL : The police box? 
60,DOCTOR : Yes! 
61,"HALL : Yeah. Well, that's gone. "
62,[Garage]
63,
64,"JAMIE: Oh, we know it's gone. That's the whole"
65,point. Its ours and somebody's stolen it. 
66,"HALL: Oh, I don't know about that. I've got a note here somewhere."
67,"Yeah, here we are. There. Police Tel Box. Collection 3 o'clock. "
68,"DOCTOR: Let me see this, please. "
69,HALL: Been signed for. 
70,"DOCTOR: Yes, so I see. J Smith. Doesn't really help us, does it? "
71,"HALL: Yeah, well, I just do what I'm told. You'd better see the airport"
72,Commandant or someone. 
73,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. I don't think we'd better do that. Jamie, I think we'd"
74,better talk to the police. 
75,"HALL: Of course I, er, I do know the name of the firm what picked it"
76,up. 
77,JAMIE: You do? 
78,"HALL: Yeah, firm name of, er, Leatherman. "
79,DOCTOR: Thank you very much. You'll be hearing from us. 
80,"JAMIE: Leatherman. Now that's a clue. Just a minute. Now, what street"
81,"do they? Doctor, wait. "
82,"(The Doctor drags Jamie outside. Once they are out of sight, Hall talks"
83,into his hearing aid.) 
84,HALL: Did you get all that? 
85,KENNEDY : Every word. We'd better get going. Get your money back at
86,the warehouse.
87,
88,[Outside the garage]
89,
90,(Kennedy watches Jamie and the Doctor through
91,binoculars.) 
92,JAMIE: We should have followed that clue he gave us. 
93,DOCTOR: Perhaps. I think we'd better keep an eye on him. 
94,JAMIE: Why? 
95,"DOCTOR: Well, didn't you notice his overalls? They were much too small"
96,"for him, and the top sheet of his clip board was different to all the"
97,others. And when we mentioned the police he became friendly 
98,"JAMIE: Aye. Hey, may "
99,(The Doctor pulls Jamie out of sight behind some oil drums as Hall
100,"walks past. A few moments later, they follow him.)"
101,
102,[Field outside the airport]
103,
104,KENNEDY: Kennedy to base. Kennedy to base. Do you
105,read me?
106,
107, [Antique shop study]
108,
109,(A man in Victorian clothes answers the radio.) 
110,KENNEDY : Kennedy to base. Do you read? 
111,WATERFIELD: Yes. 
112,KENNEDY : The Doctor and his friend are following Bob Hall. 
113,WATERFIELD: I knew they would suspect him. 
114,KENNEDY : (I'll go on to the warehouse. 
115,"WATERFIELD: Very good, Mister Kennedy."
116,
117,[Airport gates]
118,
119,(Jamie and the Doctor watch Hall drive off in his
120,car.) 
121,DOCTOR: That's him. There he goes. 
122,"JAMIE: Oh, no. "
123,(The Doctor spots a black cab.) 
124,DOCTOR: For hire. 
125,JAMIE: Ay? 
126,DOCTOR: Follow that car.
127,
128, [Antique shop study]
129,
130,(There is a knock at the door.) 
131,WATERFIELD: Yes? 
132,"PERRY OC]: Perry, sir. "
133,"WATERFIELD: Oh, er, one moment, Mister Perry. "
134,(Waterfield unbolts the door and lets in a slight man in his early
135,twenties.) 
136,PERRY: It's here. 
137,WATERFIELD: Good. 
138,"PERRY: Like me to open the shutters, sir? Lovely day outside. "
139,"WATERFIELD: I have a choice between the sun or noise, Mister Perry. I"
140,"regret shutting out one, but at least I keep out the other. "
141,"PERRY: Yes. (a clock chimes) I say, that's very good. Just come in, eh?"
142,"Mint condition. Eighteen seventy, is it? "
143,WATERFIELD: Approximately. 
144,"PERRY: Don't know who your contacts are, sir, but this is marvellous. "
145,"WATERFIELD: Well, Victorian timepieces are my specialty, Mister Perry. "
146,"PERRY: Wish you'd tell me who makes them for you, sir. "
147,"WATERFIELD: But then you would be as wise as I, and that wouldn't do at"
148,"all, would it? "
149,"PERRY: Whoever makes them, Mister Waterfield, they'd fool an expert. If"
150,"I didn't know it was impossible, I'd say it was absolutely genuine. "
151,"WATERFIELD: And, er, there was no trouble with the box? "
152,"PERRY: Apparently not. A bit out of our line, isn't it, sir? A battered"
153,old police box? 
154,"WATERFIELD: The whims and caprices of our patrons is our line, Mister"
155,Perry. 
156,PERRY: Hmm. Odd though. 
157,"WATERFIELD: Mister Perry, I pay you the sum of 50 guineas per week, do"
158,I not? 
159,"PERRY: Pounds, actually, sir. 50 pounds. "
160,WATERFIELD: Yes. I hope I may be forgiven if I believe that entitles me
161,to demanding less curiosity of you. 
162,"PERRY: Sorry, sir. "
163,"WATERFIELD: It is, I think you will agree, a princely salary. "
164,PERRY: No complaints on that score. As long as I'm not asked to do
165,anything dicey. 
166,WATERFIELD: Dicey? 
167,PERRY: Crooked. Illegal. 
168,"WATERFIELD: Your candour is refreshing, Mister Perry, even if your"
169,judgement of character is somewhat questionable. 
170,PERRY: I didn't mean that 
171,"WATERFIELD: I know perfectly well what you meant. You may rest assured,"
172,I shall not ask you to do anything dicey. 
173,"PERRY: No, sir. "
174,"WATERFIELD: I think you are wanted in the shop, Mister Perry. "
175,"PERRY: And the telephone box, sir. What do we do with it? "
176,WATERFIELD: Do? We do nothing. 
177,"PERRY: Oh, right. "
178,(Perry leaves.) 
179,WATERFIELD: Nothing except wait.
180,
181,[Lane]
182,
183,(Hall's car is parked in a narrow lane alongside
184,some railway arches with lock up garages.) 
185,DOCTOR: This is his car. He must be around here somewhere. 
186,(There is an old abandoned warehouse at the end of the lane.)
187,
188,[Warehouse]
189,
190,KENNEDY: You sure you weren't followed? 
191,"HALL: No, course I wasn't. Hey, you haven't told me what this little"
192,"caper's about yet, Kennedy. "
193,"KENNEDY: Counted the money yet then, have you? "
194,"HALL: No, not yet. "
195,KENNEDY: Or do you think I made a mistake giving you two fifty instead
196,of seventy five? We thought you might like a little extra. 
197,HALL: What for? 
198,KENNEDY: You know those two at the hangar? 
199,HALL: Yeah? 
200,KENNEDY: They're outside. You weren't followed. We'll be ready for
201,"them, won't we? That's what the extra's for. "
202,HALL: Now listen. 
203,"KENNEDY: You on one side of the door, me on the other. Right? Straight"
204,over their heads. They won't even know what hit them. 
205,"HALL: Nah, not me, mate. "
206,"KENNEDY: It's a bit late to argue, isn't it? They're outside. "
207,"HALL: Now listen, I'm not getting mixed up in no kidnapping, and that's"
208,flat. 
209,(Hall turns for the door and Kennedy attacks him.) 
210,[Outside the Warehouse]
211,
212,(Jamie hears noises inside.) 
213,JAMIE: Doctor? 
214,"DOCTOR: Well, have you tried the door? "
215,(The Doctor opens the door.) 
216,[Warehouse]
217,
218,(Hall is lying on the floor.) 
219,"DOCTOR: It's the man in the overalls. It's all right, he's alive. "
220,(Kennedy leaves unnoticed.) 
221,HALL: Where's Ken 
222,DOCTOR: Ken? Ken who? 
223,JAMIE: Make him tell us where the Tardis is! 
224,"DOCTOR: No good, he's out cold. See if we can find some water"
225,"somewhere. Hello, this is something. This really is something. "
226,(The Doctor has found the money.) 
227,DOCTOR: But why pay him to help steal the Tardis and then knock him on
228,the head? 
229,JAMIE: Why steal the Tardis anyway? 
230,"DOCTOR: That's what's been bothering me, Jamie, too. "
231,"JAMIE: There's no water here. Hey, that looks a lot of money, Doctor. "
232,"DOCTOR: It's between two and three hundred pounds. Yes, it is a lot, at"
233,least for what he had to do. Put on a pair of overalls and just hang
234,"around. Come to think of it, why hang around? He was obviously planted."
235,Why not just go off in the lorry? 
236,JAMIE: You've found something else? 
237,DOCTOR: I don't know. 
238,(There are cigarettes and a matchbook on the windowsill. The Doctor
239,searches Hall's pockets.) 
240,"DOCTOR: Yes, this man rolled his own cigarettes, so these must belong"
241,to somebody else. That's a fair assumption. 
242,(A train rumbles past over the arches.) 
243,JAMIE: What's that? 
244,DOCTOR: It's all right. It's only a train. 
245,JAMIE: A what? 
246,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a train. There are carriages and they go on wheels,"
247,"on rails, and they're drawn by a steam. Hey, come back! "
248,(Hall rushes out of the door and fastens it with a metal bar through
249,the handles.) 
250,"JAMIE: Well, give us a hand. "
251,"(When Jamie stops pushing the door, the bar falls out and the door"
252,opens.) 
253,JAMIE: Not a sign of him. The only chance we had. 
254,DOCTOR: There is this. (the matchbook) The Tricolour. It's a coffee
255,"bar, apparently. And that's not all. "
256,"JAMIE: Well, what else? "
257,"DOCTOR: Well, normally people pull out their matches from right to"
258,left. These have been torn out from left to right. 
259,JAMIE: What does that mean? 
260,"DOCTOR: It means we've got to find a coffee bar called The Tricolour,"
261,"and look for a man called Ken or Kenneth someone, who's left-handed. "
262,JAMIE: Now we've got something to go on. 
263,"DOCTOR: But it's so little, Jamie. It's too little. He might only have"
264,been there once. There's no guarantee he'll ever go there again. 
265,"JAMIE: Now, don't give up Doctor. Remember Bruce. "
266,DOCTOR: Bruce? 
267,JAMIE: Robert Bruce.
268,
269,[Antique shop study]
270,
271,"KENNEDY: Look, I told you "
272,WATERFIELD: And they were not aware that you were watching? 
273,"KENNEDY: No, they were too busy trying to work it all out. "
274,WATERFIELD: Good. 
275,KENNEDY: That Bob Hall was a bit of a problem. I didn't think he'd turn
276,nasty. 
277,WATERFIELD: You didn't hurt him? 
278,KENNEDY: Him? You're joking. 
279,WATERFIELD: I can assure you that I am not. 
280,"KENNEDY: He's a lot bigger than me, you know. No, I just battered him"
281,one and that was it. 
282,"WATERFIELD: That was what, Kennedy? I must know precisely what has"
283,happened. How badly injured was Hall? 
284,"KENNEDY: Well, a bit dazed, that's all. He just mumbled something then"
285,made a run for it when they weren't looking. 
286,WATERFIELD: And where is he now? 
287,"KENNEDY: Well, I went round to his place later. There he was coming out"
288,"the front door, zip bag and everything. He got in a cab and went to"
289,Euston. 
290,WATERFIELD: Were you able to find another hansom and follow him? 
291,KENNEDY: Ay? 
292,WATERFIELD: Did you follow him? 
293,"KENNEDY: Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about him. He's gone up north. "
294,"WATERFIELD: That disposes of that. Now, this is extremely important."
295,You did leave the matches? 
296,KENNEDY: Don't worry about it. The Doctor found the cigarettes and the
297,matches. 
298,WATERFIELD: And you are certain they were the ones bearing the name of
299,the coffee shop? 
300,KENNEDY: Coffee bar. 
301,WATERFIELD: Yes. 
302,"KENNEDY: Yes. I told you, it worked like a charm. I never thought it"
303,"would, but you were quite right. He got onto the name on the matches"
304,straight away. 
305,"WATERFIELD: Well, just one last thing, to make quite sure. "
306,(Waterfield takes two photographs from a deed box.) 
307,"WATERFIELD: Now, you are certain that these are the people that you"
308,saw? 
309,"KENNEDY: That's them, yeah. Yeah, definite. "
310,"WATERFIELD: Right. Well, I shall want you to keep out of sight. You'd"
311,better stay in the house. And on no account are you to talk to Mister
312,Perry about any of this. 
313,KENNEDY: Okay. 
314,WATERFIELD: Okay? What does that mean? 
315,KENNEDY: What? Yes! 
316,"WATERFIELD: Oh, I know my attitude may appear strange to you on"
317,"occasions, Kennedy. "
318,"KENNEDY: You want to play the part of the Victorian grandfather, that's"
319,all right by me. Must be a pretty good gimmick. You pay me well enough.
320,
321,WATERFIELD: It helps to sell to our customers. 
322,"KENNEDY: Yeah, sure, sure. You've never told me what it is exactly"
323,you've got against this Doctor and his friend. Some kind of vendetta or
324,something? 
325,WATERFIELD: Explanations are not part of our arrangement. 
326,"KENNEDY: Oh, just wondering. "
327,"WATERFIELD: Imagination is a virtue, but it can become a vice. "
328,KENNEDY: Mind me own business. Yeah. I get the message. 
329,"WATERFIELD: Ask Mister Perry to come and see me, will you please? "
330,(Kennedy leaves. Waterfield takes a key from the deed box and goes to
331,the bookcase. He removes a large volume and puts the key into a hidden
332,lock. Kennedy is watching from the hallway as the bookcase slides aside
333,and Waterfield goes into a secret room. He comes out soon after
334,carrying a large brown-paper parcel. He closes the secret door and puts
335,it on the desk.) 
336,[Antique shop hallway]
337,
338,(Kennedy realises Perry is watching him.) 
339,KENNEDY: He wants to see us. 
340,"PERRY: Oh, thank you. (He knocks four times on the door.) "
341,[Antique shop study]
342,
343,WATERFIELD: Who is it? 
344,"PERRY : Perry, sir. "
345,WATERFIELD: One moment. 
346,"PERRY: You wanted to see me, sir? "
347,WATERFIELD: Yes. I have an extremely important and delicate task for
348,you to perform. 
349,"PERRY: Oh, yes? I say, you got a new delivery. "
350,WATERFIELD: Yes. 
351,PERRY: I didn't see it arrive. 
352,WATERFIELD: It was delivered last night. I've only just brought it in
353,myself. It is for a new customer. 
354,"PERRY: Oh, yes? "
355,WATERFIELD: A Doctor Galloway. He's extremely wealthy and an ardent
356,collector. 
357,"PERRY: Of Victoriana, sir? "
358,"WATERFIELD: No less. I do not know the Doctor personally, but we have"
359,"arranged to meet in the coffee shop, er, bar, nearby. "
360,"PERRY: The Tricolour, sir? "
361,"WATERFIELD: Yes. Unfortunately, I am unable to keep the appointment, so"
362,"I want you to go instead, Mister Perry. Here is a photograph of Doctor"
363,"Galloway. This is his assistant and secretary, Mister James McCrimmon."
364,"Now, I want you to ask the Doctor to come to the shop tonight. Say at"
365,ten o' clock? 
366,"PERRY: Ten o'clock, sir? "
367,"WATERFIELD: Yes. Oh, don't worry, Mister Perry. I shall be attending to"
368,him myself. You needn't wait. 
369,"PERRY: Oh, right, sir. "
370,WATERFIELD: The Doctor is notoriously unpunctual. I fear you may have a
371,long and tedious wait. 
372,"PERRY: I shall find him, sir. Do you want me to go now? "
373,"WATERFIELD: If you please, Mister Perry. "
374,PERRY: Right. 
375,"(Perry leaves, closing the door.) "
376,[Antique shop hallway]
377,
378,(Kennedy comes out of hiding and listens at the
379,"study door. Inside, Waterfield bolts the door and goes inside the"
380,"secret room again. This area is bright, with a large packing case in"
381,one corner. A carved chair faces the far wall where two metal arms
382,"extend into the room, about four feet off the floor and eight feet"
383,apart. Waterfield adjusts some very un-Victorian equipment and sits in
384,the chair as the machinery hums.) 
385,PERRY: And what are you doing? 
386,KENNEDY: I can't make Mister Waterfield hear me. I knocked. 
387,PERRY: He's busy. 
388,"KENNEDY: Okay, I'll try later."
389,
390, [Tricolour coffee bar]
391,
392,('Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen' by the
393,Seekers is playing on the jukebox.) 
394,"JAMIE: Don't look so depressed, Doctor. "
395,"DOCTOR: If only we knew what he looked like, Jamie. "
396,"JAMIE: We'll ask one of the lasses in a moment, when things get"
397,quieter. 
398,"DOCTOR: We've got to untangle this, you know. "
399,JAMIE: It's all quite obvious to me. 
400,DOCTOR: Oh? 
401,"JAMIE: They're just robbers. Thieves, you understand. "
402,"DOCTOR: No, no. There's more to it than that. Why leave that man in the"
403,hangar to give us a clue? 
404,"JAMIE: Which we haven't followed up, you know. Leatherman. "
405,"DOCTOR: There is no delivery firm of that name. Not in the London area,"
406,anyway. I checked in the phone book. 
407,JAMIE: But surely there's more places than London. 
408,DOCTOR: Maybe. 
409,"JAMIE: Do you think this is some sort of a trap, Doctor? "
410,DOCTOR: Yes. If only we knew who our enemies are. 
411,JAMIE: Not the Chameleons again! 
412,"DOCTOR: No, something else. I can feel them, closing in all around us."
413,
414, [Antique shop secret room]
415,
416,WATERFIELD: I've done everything that you've asked
417,of me. Isn't that enough? Now you must tell me the truth. Do you hear?
418,The truth! 
419,[Antique shop hallway]
420,
421,(Kennedy is listening at the study door.) 
422,WATERFIELD : But you must tell me. I demand! I'm talking to you!
423,Come back! 
424,"(Waterfield comes out of the secret room, sweaty and tired, and locks"
425,"it up. Then he lies down on his couch. With nothing more heard, Kennedy"
426,leaves.)
427,
428, [Tricolour coffee bar]
429,
430,(The Doctor is building a tower of sugar cubes as
431,"Jamie returns from the counter, evading the attentions of a young lady"
432,"in a mini-kilt. The jukebox has moved onto Hold Tight by Dave Dee, Dozy,"
433,"Beaky, Mitch and Titch.) "
434,"JAMIE: Oh, if only the Laird could see that! Why do I get all the"
435,"difficult tasks, Doctor? "
436,"DOCTOR: Because you're so much better at them than I am, Jamie. Now,"
437,what did you find out? 
438,JAMIE: None of the lasses here can remember anybody called Ken or
439,Kenneth. 
440,"DOCTOR: Oh, dear. "
441,"JAMIE: Aye. But, they do have a different lot on duty in the evening."
442,"Now, maybe they'll know. "
443,"DOCTOR: Jamie, I'm being stared at. Is there something wrong with me? "
444,"JAMIE: You mean up here, Doctor? "
445,DOCTOR: Is my hair in disarray? 
446,"JAMIE: Well, no more than usual. "
447,DOCTOR: Do I look strange or bizarre? 
448,JAMIE: Aye. Well maybe I'm just used to you. 
449,"DOCTOR: That's some comfort. Look out, he's coming over. "
450,PERRY: I beg your pardon. 
451,DOCTOR: Not at all. 
452,"PERRY: It is Doctor Galloway, isn't it? "
453,JAMIE: Dr. Galloway? 
454,PERRY: and Mister McCrimmon. 
455,"JAMIE: Aye, I'm Jamie McCrimmon. "
456,PERRY: My card. 
457,"DOCTOR: Yes, er, Mister Perry? "
458,"PERRY: Mister Waterfield's frightfully sorry, but he can't meet you as"
459,arranged. 
460,"DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, dear. What a pity. "
461,PERRY: But he said if you'd care to come to the shop at about ten
462,"tonight, he'll see to you personally. "
463,"DOCTOR: At about 10. Oh, yes. We'll be there. "
464,PERRY: Right-ho. 
465,DOCTOR: Right. 
466,PERRY: Right. 
467,(Perry leaves.) 
468,DOCTOR: Edward Waterfield. Genuine Victoriana. 
469,"JAMIE: It can't be a mistake. Even though he got your name wrong, he"
470,knew mine. 
471,DOCTOR: I wonder if Mister Kenneth has found us. 
472,JAMIE: Ay? 
473,"DOCTOR: K. Perry, Esquire. Yes, I think we'll go and see Mister Edward"
474,Waterfield.
475,
476,[Antique shop study]
477,
478,WATERFIELD: And he definitely said he would be
479,here? 
480,"PERRY: Yes, sir. "
481,"WATERFIELD: Thank you. You have done excellently, Mister Perry. Good"
482,night. 
483,"PERRY: See you in the morning, sir? "
484,"WATERFIELD: Yes. Yes, in the morning. "
485,[Antique shop hallway]
486,
487,"(Waterfield follows Perry out, locking the study"
488,behind him. He hears the front door shut.) 
489,WATERFIELD: Kennedy. Kennedy? 
490,(Kennedy appears.) 
491,WATERFIELD: The Doctor is coming here tonight. I shall want you to help
492,me. And you had better put some warm clothes on. Dark things. 
493,KENNEDY: All right. You'd better make sure that police box is well
494,"covered-up, in case the Doctor starts snooping about. "
495,WATERFIELD: Yes. 
496,"(Waterfield leaves. Kennedy looks at his watch then the study door,"
497,then takes a lock-pick from his back pocket and breaks into the study
498,before going back to the hall for his jacket and briefcase. In the
499,"study, he searches the desk drawers. Kennedy tries to force the deed"
500,"box but fails. Searching for a hidden safe, he accidentally opens the"
501,door to the secret room.) 
502,[Antique shop secret room]
503,
504,(Kennedy enters. He examines the metal armatures
505,whilst flicking switches. The mechanism hums. Kennedy checks his watch
506,"again, and continues searching until he finds the safe. As he tries to"
507,"open it, a strange shape is forming behind him. Finally he succeeds and"
508,"starts emptying it, then stops as he catches sight of an unearthly"
509,reflection in the metal. He turns to see a permanently annoyed mobile
510,giant pepper pot behind him.) 
511,DALEK: Who are you? Who are you? Answer!

523,(The Doctor silences the door bell as they
524,enter.) 
525,JAMIE: I don't know what you're being so cautious about. 
526,DOCTOR: Shh! 
527,"JAMIE: They left the door open for us, didn't they? "
528,(A multitude of clocks chime.) 
529,"JAMIE: Hey, it's half-past the nine o'clock. "
530,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know. "
531,JAMIE: But they made the appointment for ten. Why have we come early? 
532,"DOCTOR: The early bird catches the worm, Jamie. Now do be quiet,"
533,"there's a good chap. And for heaven's sake, don't knock into anything. "
534,(The Doctor brushes past a statuette on a pedestal and Jamie catches it
535,before it falls.) 
536,DOCTOR: Shh! 
537,(Jamie looks at the statuette.) 
538,"JAMIE: Any good, this? "
539,"DOCTOR: It's interesting. In fact, Jamie, it's quite remarkable. "
540,"JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, you know you told me outside it said Genuine"
541,"Victorian Antiques? Well, all the stuff in here's brand new. "
542,"DOCTOR: Hmm, you've noticed that. "
543,JAMIE: Of course I did. The man's a rogue. 
544,"DOCTOR: Yes, so it seems. Except "
545,JAMIE: Except what? 
546,DOCTOR: Except that all these things are not reproductions. They're all
547,genuine. 
548,"JAMIE: Now, that's ridiculous. "
549,"DOCTOR: Here, look at this. To one deed box, four guineas. This is a"
550,"bill from William Dearing and Son, 1866. "
551,JAMIE: Then it's a forgery. 
552,"DOCTOR: Yes. If you were going to make a forgery, wouldn't you try to"
553,"dirty it up a bit? Yellow the edges, crinkle it up? This is brand new. "
554,JAMIE: I've got an idea. 
555,DOCTOR: What? 
556,JAMIE: All the stuff in here is genuine. 
557,DOCTOR: Yes. 
558,JAMIE: But brand new. 
559,DOCTOR: Well done. 
560,"JAMIE: Well, that is impossible, unless Waterfield could have invented"
561,"a time machine like the Tardis, Doctor, and he's bringing all this"
562,stuff back from Victorian times. 
563,"DOCTOR: But it's not very likely, is it? The only way to find out is to"
564,ask Waterfield. 
565,[Antique shop study]
566,
567,WATERFIELD: Kennedy! 
568,[Antique shop secret room]
569,
570,WATERFIELD: What happened? 
571,DALEK: The human discovered our communications system. 
572,WATERFIELD: And you murdered him? 
573,DALEK: He would have betrayed us. 
574,WATERFIELD: You don't have to kill! 
575,DALEK: Silence! 
576,WATERFIELD: I won't be silent! What are you dragging me into? You've
577,destroyed a human life. Don't you understand that? 
578,DALEK: That is of no consequence. 
579,WATERFIELD: No consequence? 
580,DALEK: There is only one form of life that matters. Dalek life. Obey
581,"your orders, Waterfield. "
582,(The Dalek dematerializes.) 
583,"WATERFIELD: No, wait, wait! What am I to do with the body? I can't, I"
584,can't go on with this.

587,
588,"DOCTOR: I'm sure I heard somebody shouting. Jamie,"
589,we've got to get in there. 
590,JAMIE: What about the wire? 
591,DOCTOR: It's too pliable. 
592,"(They hear somebody coming, and hide. The shop door opens, ringing the"
593,bell. Waterfield checks the servant's indicator. The Doctor sneaks up
594,behind the newcomer.) 
595,DOCTOR: Boo! 
596,PERRY: Oh! What are you doing here? 
597,DOCTOR: You made the appointment. 
598,PERRY: For ten o'clock. 
599,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, we thought we'd be early. What are you doing here? "
600,PERRY: I work here. 
601,JAMIE: Then what are you creeping about for? 
602,PERRY: Er. 
603,JAMIE: Aye. 
604,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think you've got some explaining to do, Mister Kenneth"
605,Perry. 
606,"PERRY: My name isn't Kenneth, it's Keith. Now look, I don't understand"
607,this. 
608,"DOCTOR: So, it's Keith. Do you know a man called Bob Hall? "
609,"PERRY: Well, he's a man Mister Waterfield employs. "
610,"DOCTOR: Well, he keeps some very rough company, including a man called"
611,Ken. 
612,PERRY: Ken. Kennedy? 
613,DOCTOR: What? What do you know about Kennedy? 
614,"PERRY: Oh, wait a minute. This is all too quick for me. Look, I'll"
615,"answer your questions, if you'll answer mine. "
616,"(Waterfield takes the photograph of the Doctor into the secret room,"
617,takes a box out of a valise and tears the photograph in half. He then
618,puts half the picture in the box to make it look as if it was torn and
619,trapped as the lid was shut.) 
620,PERRY: This old police box was for a collector of curios. 
621,DOCTOR: But it belongs to me. 
622,PERRY: But why is it so important to you? 
623,"DOCTOR: Because, because of what's inside it and because it happens to"
624,be my property. 
625,"JAMIE: Look, where is it? "
626,PERRY: At the back. 
627,"DOCTOR: Well, is there another way through? This door is locked. "
628,"PERRY: We might be able to get over the yard gates. You see, this door"
629,has an electric lock on it. 
630,DOCTOR: You're going to show me where this yard of yours is. 
631,"PERRY: I say, if it's a police box, shouldn't we get the police? "
632,(The door opens.) 
633,JAMIE: Doctor. 
634, [Antique shop study]
635,
636,PERRY: That's Kennedy! 
637,DOCTOR: He's dead. 
638,JAMIE: What are you doing? 
639,PERRY: Getting the police. What? 
640,(There's a buzzing sound on the line. Perry puts the telephone down.) 
641,PERRY: I don't think you ought to touch anything. I'll be as quick as I
642,can. 
643,(Perry leaves.) 
644,JAMIE: Should we have let him go? 
645,"DOCTOR: No, he's doing the right thing. "
646,JAMIE: But the Tardis? 
647,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, we'll have to find it before he comes back. Now I"
648,wonder what this telephone interference is. 
649,JAMIE: Looks as if Waterfield's cleared out. 
650,DOCTOR: Why make an appointment to see us at ten? 
651,"JAMIE: Well, obviously, he didn't know he was going to have a fight"
652,"with Kennedy. Och, come on Doctor, lets find the Tardis and go. "
653,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, the Tardis. Now, how did he die? His limbs are stiff,"
654,"his hands clenched. Look, he died in horrible agony. Look at his face."
655,Hello? 
656,(There is half a photograph in Kennedy's hand.) 
657,JAMIE: What? It's your picture! 
658,"DOCTOR: Yes. Now, he fell like that, with his arm stretched out. Jamie,"
659,go out into the hall and measure the length of it up to the door here. 
660,(The Doctor paces out the study.) 
661,"JAMIE: Fourteen, fifteen. "
662,DOCTOR: It's only five from the door to the wall. There must be another
663,room behind here. 
664,"JAMIE: Hey Doctor, there's a keyhole. "
665,"DOCTOR: Yes, you're right. Now, Waterfield will have the key. We'd"
666,better find something to prise it open with. 
667,(The door opens.) 
668,[Antique shop secret room]
669,
670,(Waterfield watches from the study.) 
671,"DOCTOR: Well, look at this. That's where your telephone interference is"
672,"coming from. Oh, yes, this is interesting. "
673,"JAMIE: Hey, the other half of your picture. "
674,DOCTOR: Yes. Don't open that! 
675,(Too late. A gas makes them collapse. Waterfield enters with a
676,handkerchief over his mouth and closes the box. He stands in the
677,transmat with the Doctor and Jamie.)

681,(Perry enters with a policeman.) 
682,"PERRY: This way, along here. "
683,"(Meanwhile Waterfield, the Doctor and Jamie dematerialise, along with"
684,the entire transmat apparatus.)
685,
686,[Antique shop study]
687,
688,PERRY: Here we are. That's funny. There were a
689,couple of other gentlemen here. They seem to have disappeared.

691, [Maxtible's sitting room]
692,
693,(Birdsong can be heard through the open doors. The
694,Doctor and Jamie are tucked up on
695,"chairs, with blankets over them. The Doctor wakes, groaning, and there"
696,is a knock at the door. A maid servant enters with a tray.) 
697,"MOLLIE: Hello sir. Are you feeling better? Oh, you did have a party"
698,"last night, didn't you sir? The master sent this in for you. "
699,DOCTOR: The master? Mister Waterfield? 
700,"MOLLIE: Oh, no, sir, Mister Maxtible. Mister Waterfield came back from"
701,"abroad last night, sir, with you and the young gentleman. Don't you"
702,remember? 
703,"DOCTOR: Not very well, no. Ooh! "
704,"(Mollie pours a glass of liquid for the Doctor, which does him a power"
705,of good.) 
706,MOLLIE: I'd best not wake him. 
707,DOCTOR: What's your name? 
708,"MOLLIE: Mollie Dawson, sir. "
709,"DOCTOR: This works remarkably quickly, doesn't it? "
710,MOLLIE: Am I to pour some more? 
711,"DOCTOR: No. No thank you, Mollie. But, you can tell me what the date"
712,is. 
713,MOLLIE: The date? 
714,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm feeling very much better, but I don't seem to be able"
715,to remember the date and where I am. 
716,"MAXTIBLE: Mollie, that will do. The answers you require, sir, might"
717,come better from me. My name is Theodore Maxtible and I am the owner of
718,"this house. Pray, don't get up. I have the greatest sympathy for your"
719,"condition, since I was the cause of it. "
720,(Underneath those whiskers is the wonderful  Marius
721,Goring.) 
722,"DOCTOR: And this is Mister Edward Waterfield, I presume. You don't keep"
723,"your appointments, do you? "
724,WATERFIELD: There were circumstances. 
725,"DOCTOR: Yes, indeed there were. "
726,"MAXTIBLE: Please, please, Doctor. First things first. You asked what"
727,date it was and where you were. 
728,DOCTOR: Yes. Well? 
729,"MAXTIBLE: You're in my house, some miles from Canterbury. The date is"
730,"June the 2nd, eighteen hundred and sixty six. "
731,"DOCTOR: And just what do you think you're up to? You steal my property,"
732,you spirit Jamie and me a hundred years back in time and you murder a
733,man along the way. 
734,MAXTIBLE: We had nothing to do with the death of that man. 
735,DOCTOR: I don't believe you! 
736,"MAXTIBLE: You will believe, Doctor. We are all of us the victims of a"
737,higher power. A power more evil and more terrible than the human brain
738,can imagine. 
739,DOCTOR: Power? Victims? What do you mean? 
740,"WATERFIELD: They've taken my daughter, Victoria. "
741,DOCTOR: Who are they? 
742,"MAXTIBLE: You will not be kept in suspense very much longer, Doctor."
743,"Pray, come with us and we will show you how it all began. "
744,"WATERFIELD: Doctor, do whatever it is they ask, I beg of you. My"
745,daughter's life is in your hands. 
746,"DOCTOR: I will listen, I promise. "
747,(Waterfield is looking at a portrait over the fireplace.) 
748,DOCTOR: Is that your daughter? 
749,"WATERFIELD: No, sir. That is a painting of my wife as a young girl. She"
750,"is dead now, rest her soul, but Victoria is the image of her."

757,VICTORIA: Yes. 
758,DALEK: You will not feed the flying pests outside. Answer! 
759,VICTORIA: Yes. 
760,DALEK: Move to the machine. Move! 
761,"(Victoria steps between two columns of lights, and there is a"
762,brain-splitting whine.
763,"VICTORIA: No, no. "
764,"(The numbers on the wall read 111-968, 2113-4, 7582-1) "
765,DALEK: Move. Move! The weight of your body has fallen by seventeen
766,ounces. 
767,"VICTORIA: What do you expect? What do you expect? For pity's sake, let"
768,me go! 
769,"DALEK: Speak when you are told to speak! More food will come. Eat it,"
770,or you will be fed by force!

772,
773,(Lots of bubbling retorts and rubber tubing.) 
774,"MAXTIBLE: Here we are, Doctor. This is hallowed ground. Here we shall"
775,not be disturbed by the servants. 
776,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, very impressive. And now perhaps you'll explain"
777,what all this is about? 
778,"MAXTIBLE: Patience, my dear sir, a little longer. "
779,DOCTOR: Patience? You don't seem to understand what's happened. A man
780,has been murdered! You behave as though we're going on Sunday school
781,outing. 
782,MAXTIBLE: Neither Whitefield nor I were responsible for his death. A
783,cigar? 
784,"DOCTOR: Why have you brought us here? Who are these enemies of yours,"
785,these ones you say control you? 
786,"MAXTIBLE: Brilliant minds, Doctor. "
787,WATERFIELD: They are monsters. 
788,"MAXTIBLE: Oh, I admit, Waterfield, they have behaved callously. "
789,WATERFIELD: Inhuman monsters! 
790,DOCTOR: Inhuman? 
791,WATERFIELD: Creations of the devil! 
792,MAXTIBLE: Let me explain. 
793,DOCTOR: Please do. 
794,MAXTIBLE: I have always been fascinated by the concept of travelling
795,through time. Waterfield here is an expert in certain technical matters
796,and I have the money to indulge my whims. Everything you see about you
797,here was constructed by us two. 
798,DOCTOR: To try to find a way of exploring time? 
799,"MAXTIBLE: Yes. Now this is my theory. A mirror reflects an image, does"
800,it not? 
801,DOCTOR: Yes. 
802,"MAXTIBLE: So, you may be standing there, and yet appear to be standing"
803,"fifty feet away. Well, following the new investigations twelve years"
804,ago by J Clark Maxwell into electromagnetism and the experiments by
805,Faraday into static electricity. 
806,DOCTOR: Static? 
807,MAXTIBLE: Correct. Waterfield and I first attempted to refine the image
808,"in the mirror, and then to project it. In here, Doctor, are one hundred"
809,and forty four separate mirrors. 
810,(They are behind a pair of gothic pointed doors.) 
811,WATERFIELD: And each is of polished metal. Each is subjected to
812,"electric charges, all positive. "
813,"MAXTIBLE: Like repels like in electricity, Doctor, and so next,"
814,"Waterfield and I attempted to repel the image in the mirrors, wherever"
815,we directed. 
816,DOCTOR: You mentioned static electricity. 
817,WATERFIELD: That was our last experiment. Negative and positive
818,"electricity had failed, so we tried static. If only we could have known"
819,the powers we were going to unleash. 
820,DOCTOR: Powers? 
821,"WATERFIELD: In the middle of our final test with static, creatures"
822,"burst out of the cabinet, invaded the house, took away my daughter. "
823,"MAXTIBLE: Oh, my dear fellow. My dear, dear fellow. But we shall win"
824,through now that the Doctor is here. 
825,DOCTOR: These creatures? 
826,WATERFIELD: We had opened the way for them with our experiments. They
827,"forced me into the horror of time travel, Doctor. They ordered me to"
828,steal a box belonging to you and thus lure you into a trap and
829,"transport you here, together with your colleague Mister McCrimmon. "
830,"DOCTOR: They knew about me, these creatures. "
831,MAXTIBLE: They gave us likenesses. 
832,WATERFIELD: What could I do? They said my daughter would die. 
833,"DOCTOR: What are they called, these creatures? "
834,DALEK: Doctor! Now do you understand? 
835,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Perfectly. "
836,DALEK: Move back! Our plan has worked. We shall triumph! You will obey!
837,You will obey! 
838,DOCTOR: Obey? Obey? What do you want? 
839,DALEK: We have your time ship. We will destroy it unless you help us
840,with an experiment. 
841,DOCTOR: What experiment? 
842,DALEK: You will help the Daleks test another human being. 
843,DOCTOR: What sort of test? 
844,DALEK: Do not question! 
845,DOCTOR: I will not be your slave! 
846,"WATERFIELD: Doctor, I beg you. "
847,DALEK: No harm will come to you if you agree. Where is your companion? 
848,DOCTOR: Jamie? 
849,WATERFIELD: He is in the house. I have done everything you asked me to.
850,
851,DOCTOR: Why do you ask about Jamie? 
852,DALEK: He is the human being who is to be tested. 
853,DOCTOR: What do you mean? Tested how? 
854,DALEK: Silence! You will reveal nothing to your companion. Obey the
855,Daleks! You are in our power! 
856,(The Dalek goes into the mirrored room.) 
857,DOCTOR: What have you done with your infernal meddling? What is this
858,test? Do either of you know? 
859,WATERFIELD: No. 
860,"MAXTIBLE: I believe I do. They, I mean the Daleks, tell me they have"
861,always been defeated by human beings. 
862,"DOCTOR: In the long run, yes. "
863,"MAXTIBLE: Possibly because of some factor, possessed by human beings "
864,DOCTOR: Possibly. 
865,MAXTIBLE: That is absent in Daleks. 
866,DOCTOR: Possibly. 
867,MAXTIBLE: Perhaps they want to find out what it is and transplant it
868,into their race. 
869,"WATERFIELD: But if they do that, allied with their own alien"
870,"intelligence, they'll be invincible! Maxtible, you should've "
871,"MAXTIBLE: Oh, my dear fellow. I am merely surmising. I know nothing"
872,"definite. But, besides, what could we have done? Even if I had known"
873,"for certain, the fact was, nay is, they hold your daughter, Victoria. "
874,DOCTOR: And now they've got Jamie.
875,
876, [Maxtible's sitting room]
877,
878,"MOLLIE: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to wake"
879,you. There. 
880,(Jamie clutches his head.) 
881,"JAMIE: Oh, it's not funny. Oh. "
882,"MOLLIE: The master left this for you to drink, sir. This'll clear away"
883,"the cobwebs. Here you are, sir. "
884,JAMIE: Where's the Doctor? Oh. 
885,"MOLLIE: He's with the master and Mister Waterfield, sir. "
886,JAMIE: Waterfield? 
887,RUTH: Mollie? What are you doing here? 
888,(Welcome  Brigit
889,"Forsyth, everyone.) "
890,"MOLLIE: Just seeing to the young gentleman, miss. "
891,"RUTH: Go and bring some tea. Well, go along. "
892,(Mollie leaves.) 
893,"RUTH: Please, Mister McCrimmon. "
894,JAMIE: You know my name? 
895,RUTH: My father told me that you and your friend arrived last night
896,with Mister Waterfield. 
897,JAMIE: Your father? I'm sorry but I seem to have great difficulty in
898,remembering anything. 
899,"RUTH: He owns this house. I'm his daughter, Ruth Maxtible. "
900,JAMIE: How do you do? Have you seen the Doctor this morning? 
901,RUTH: He's talking with my father. He'll be along presently. Do you
902,have everything you need? 
903,"JAMIE: I don't know what this stuff is, but it seems to work all right."
904,
905,RUTH: Mollie shall bring you some tea in a minute. 
906,"JAMIE: I'm obliged to you. Er, Miss Maxtible? "
907,RUTH: Yes? 
908,JAMIE: Could you tell me who that is in the portrait? 
909,RUTH: That's a portrait of Mister Waterfield's late wife. 
910,JAMIE: She was very lovely. 
911,"RUTH: Yes, and his daughter looks just like her. You're quite"
912,comfortable? 
913,JAMIE: Yes. Thank you. 
914,(Ruth leaves. Jamie starts to search a writing bureau as a ruffian
915,enters through the French windows and hides behind a curtain. He is
916,played by
917, Windsor
918,Davies.) 
919,JAMIE: Eighteen sixty six. So that's what Waterfield's done. 
920,(Jamie looks around the room then picks up his blanket and moves his
921,chair to face the couch. Toby the ruffian hits him over the back of the
922,head then leaves when there is a knocking on the door.) 
923,MOLLIE: Here we are sir. I've been as quick as I could. Shall I pour
924,for you? Poor young gentleman. They shouldn't have given you so much to
925,drink. 
926,(Toby returns and grabs Mollie from behind with his hand over her
927,mouth.)
928,
929, [Maxtible's hallway]
930,
931,"WATERFIELD: Doctor, I do ask you to consider. "
932,DOCTOR: I have made up my mind. 
933,MAXTIBLE: But they ordered you not to tell your friend McCrimmon
934,anything. 
935,DOCTOR: Do you think I'm going to allow Jamie to run into danger
936,"without telling him anything? No, I will not. "
937,MAXTIBLE: But suppose he refuses to do what they want? 
938,DOCTOR: We shall see. 
939, [Maxtible's sitting room]
940,
941,DOCTOR: He's still asleep. The gas in that box of
942,yours was pretty potent. 
943,WATERFIELD: It was Maxtible's invention. 
944,DOCTOR: Jamie. 
945,(But it is not Jamie under the blanket.) 
946,WATERFIELD: Mollie!
947,
948, [Maxtible's laboratory]
949,
950,DALEK: Order the Doctor to begin the test. 
951,MAXTIBLE: But I must first explain to him what he has to do. 
952,DALEK: Go now. Obey the Daleks!
953,
954, [Maxtible's sitting room]
955,
956,(The Doctor is examining marks on the floor with
957,his magnifying glass.) 
958,WATERFIELD: But your friend is vital to the plan of these Daleks.
959,Absolutely essential. 
960,DOCTOR: So it seems. So who can have kidnapped him? 
961,"WATERFIELD: Oh, why won't you understand? The threats they make are not"
962,"idle ones. Kennedy was murdered. Without your friend, our only hope is"
963,"gone unless, unless you know something. You seem to be well acquainted"
964,with the creatures. 
965,"DOCTOR: Everything you say, Waterfield, is true. If we cannot find"
966,"Jamie, the Daleks will take pleasure in killing everyone in sight, and"
967,their greatest pleasure will be in killing me.
968,
969, [Dalek's room]
970,
971,DALEK: The humans have been told to begin the test.
972,
973,DALEK 2: Any delay will result in death. 
974,DALEK: There will be no delay. 
975,
976, Episode Three
977,
978,[Maxtible's sitting room]
979,
980,"WATERFIELD: Mollie, Mollie. Mister McCrimmon has"
981,been kidnapped. It means the end of us unless we can find him quickly. 
982,DOCTOR: Straw. 
983,WATERFIELD: I beg your pardon? 
984,DOCTOR: A piece of straw. 
985,(It was stuck in the mud by the French windows.)
986,
987,[Stables]
988,
989,"TOBY: Had a cosy little sleep, young swell? "
990,(Jamie pushes him away.) 
991,"TOBY: Lively, is it? Maybe you'd like to sleep again? I've got Mister"
992,Nod here. He'll have you snoring as good as ever. 
993,JAMIE: What do you want? 
994,TOBY: I'm to be well paid. Have no fear of that. 
995,"JAMIE: Aye, and for what? I don't know you. "
996,(Another man enters. He is very well-spoken.) 
997,"TOBY: This your man, sir? "
998,TERRALL: Toby! What in Hades have you done? 
999,"TOBY: Why, I brought him from the house, like you said. "
1000,TERRALL: I said nothing of the kind. 
1001,"TOBY: Well, you did, sir. Honest you did. A guinea you promised me, and"
1002,I done what you said. You don't get out of paying. 
1003,"TERRALL: Be careful how you speak to me, Toby. There's your money. Get"
1004,out! 
1005,(Toby picks up the coin and leaves. Terrall steps towards Jamie then
1006,stops. He appears to be in great pain. Then he is suddenly normal
1007,again.) 
1008,TERRALL: Where's Toby? 
1009,"JAMIE: You just sent him about his business. Look, what's the matter?"
1010,Are you all right? 
1011,TERRALL: Where's Victoria Waterfield? 
1012,JAMIE: I don't know. 
1013,"TERRALL: Yes, you do. "
1014,"JAMIE: I tell you, I don't even know her. "
1015,"TERRALL: You're in the house, a friend of Maxtible's. You must know. "
1016,"JAMIE: No, listen, I'm telling "
1017,"(Terrall grimaces in pain again, then recovers.) "
1018,"TERRALL: Ah ha, I must apologise for that villain Toby. He was telling"
1019,"lies, of course. I shall escort you to the house. "
1020,JAMIE: You just asked me about Victoria Waterfield. 
1021,TERRALL: She's in Paris. I'm afraid I haven't introduced myself. Arthur
1022,Terrall. 
1023,"JAMIE: No, never mind about that. Did you or did you not, ask that man"
1024,to knock me on the head and bring me in here? 
1025,"TERRALL: I, oh certainly not! "
1026,JAMIE: Oh. Doctor! 
1027,(The DOCTOR enters.) 
1028,TERRALL: Oh. I see you're in good hands now. I won't detain you any
1029,"further. Good day, Doctor. "
1030,"DOCTOR: Oh, good day to you. "
1031,(Terrall leaves.) 
1032,"JAMIE: He's mad. Stark, staring mad. "
1033,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know. I was listening. Let's have a look at that head of"
1034,yours. 
1035,"JAMIE: Och, it's all right. "
1036,DOCTOR: Come along. 
1037,"JAMIE: One minute he says this, the next minute he says that. Can you"
1038,"make it out, Doctor? I'm knocked on the head and I'm brought in here."
1039,Then that man Terrall enters and denies having ordered the other man to
1040,"do it. Well, then he changes, and he starts asking about Victoria"
1041,"Waterfield and in the next breath, he tells me she's in Paris. "
1042,DOCTOR: I know what's happened to Victoria. 
1043,JAMIE: What has? 
1044,DOCTOR: She's a prisoner of the Daleks.
1045,
1046,[Victoria's room]
1047,
1048,DALEK: Hurry! 
1049,VICTORIA: Why am I being moved? Are you taking me back to my father? 
1050,DALEK: No. You are being moved. Pick up your cover. Follow. Do not be
1051,afraid. You are not to be exterminated. 
1052,[Corridor]
1053,
1054,DALEK: Do not delay. 
1055,(Victoria stops at a window to look outside at the gardens.) 
1056,DALEK 2: Move.
1057,
1058,[Maxtible's sitting room]
1059,
1060,"WATERFIELD: You warned him, told him about the"
1061,Daleks? 
1062,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course I did! "
1063,WATERFIELD: But you were expressly told 
1064,"DOCTOR: Oh, fiddlesticks! Bosh! Jamie will cooperate. You may be"
1065,certain of that. 
1066,WATERFIELD: Are you sure? 
1067,"DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly sure. Jamie will do everything he is asked to"
1068,"do. Now come along, we must go and find Maxtible. "
1069,"(Jamie has overheard this, and is worried.)"
1070,
1071,[Maxtible's laboratory]
1072,
1073,(Maxtible is working when a Dalek comes out of the
1074,mirrored room.) 
1075,DALEK: The female human being has been moved. 
1076,MAXTIBLE: Everything is prepared. 
1077,DALEK: The testing equipment is ready? 
1078,MAXTIBLE: I think you will be pleased with the man I have had specially
1079,brought from London. He works in my house. 
1080,DALEK: Show me. 
1081,MAXTIBLE: You will understand that he is rather simple. He is quite
1082,"dumb, but that has its advantages for us. His mind is, how shall I say,"
1083,"undeveloped. He will not understand you, the Daleks. I mean, he will be"
1084,terrified of you. 
1085,DALEK: Show me. 
1086,"MAXTIBLE: Oh, I beg your pardon. "
1087,(The Dalek backs into the mirrored room to watch. Maxtible calls into
1088,the corridor.) 
1089,MAXTIBLE: Kemel! 
1090,"(A giant man appears, in traditional Turkish dress.) "
1091,"MAXTIBLE: Will you come with me? I want you to stand here. No, no, no,"
1092,"no, no, face the cabinet. Good. "
1093,(Maxtible gives Kemel a thick iron bar.) 
1094,"MAXTIBLE: Now, bend that. "
1095,"(Kemel tests the bar against his leg, then removes his waistcoat and"
1096,shirt and starts to bend the bar against the back of his neck. Then he
1097,removes it and finishes the job with upper body strength alone.) 
1098,"MAXTIBLE: Excellent, Kemel, excellent. Now, you'll help me with these"
1099,stools. 
1100,(Maxtible puts two stools a short distance apart and puts a thick plank
1101,of wood across the top.) 
1102,"MAXTIBLE: There. Now, Kemel, one blow. Break the plank! "
1103,(He does so with one fist.) 
1104,"MAXTIBLE: Very good, Kemel. I'm very pleased with you. Now you can put"
1105,"on your jacket. Come over here. Now, I want you to listen carefully."
1106,You see this man? 
1107,(He shows Kemel a photograph of Jamie.) 
1108,"MAXTIBLE: Now, I'm going to take you to a place that I want you to"
1109,guard. This young man will try and get past you and you are not to let
1110,"him. Do you understand? Oh, he's an evil villain, Kemel. A cutthroat"
1111,who would gladly murder us all in our beds if he could. You will
1112,"remember this man? Right. Well, you come with me and I will direct you."
1113,
1114,"(Maxtible and Kemel leave, and the Dalek comes out to look closely at"
1115,the bent iron bar.)
1116,
1117,[Alcove]
1118,
1119,MAXTIBLE: You wait here. 
1120,(Maxtible takes a candle and matches from an upper shelf.)
1121,"MAXTIBLE: This is the entrance to the south wing of my house, and"
1122,through here will pass the man I showed you in the picture. The door
1123,itself is an obstacle. 
1124,(Maxtible presses a hidden switch and a door at the back of the alcove
1125,opens.) 
1126,"MAXTIBLE: No, no, wait! "
1127,(Maxtible stops Kemel getting speared by metal spikes that thud down
1128,across the entrance. He presses a second switch and the spikes
1129,retract.) 
1130,"MAXTIBLE: Now, if he gets through here, you will deal with him. Go now."
1131,
1132,(Kemel moves down the corridor. Maxtible closes the alcove door and
1133,blows out the candle.)
1134,
1135,[Maxtible's laboratory]
1136,
1137,DALEK: We do not trust you. 
1138,"DOCTOR: Then we're quits, aren't we? "
1139,DALEK: But we have your time machine. 
1140,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1141,"DALEK: So, you will obey us. "
1142,"DOCTOR: They want the human Factor, is that right? "
1143,"WATERFIELD: Yes, that is what they want. "
1144,DOCTOR: Very complex. And you want to introduce this human factor into
1145,the race of Daleks? 
1146,"DALEK: Yes, the conquest of humanity has eluded us. The Daleks must"
1147,know why. 
1148,DOCTOR: Well why choose Jamie for this test? 
1149,DALEK: His travelling with you makes him unique. 
1150,"DOCTOR: But why him, why not me? "
1151,DALEK: Request denied. 
1152,DOCTOR: Why? 
1153,DALEK: You have travelled too much through time. You are more than
1154,human. 
1155,DOCTOR: I see. What is this? 
1156,(Three large packing cases beside the workbench. Maxtible enters.) 
1157,MAXTIBLE: They have been brought from the Dalek planet. 
1158,DOCTOR: Skaro? 
1159,DALEK: Yes. 
1160,(Maxtible removes the lid from one case. Inside is a Dalek without its
1161,metal casing.) 
1162,"DALEK: their life force is dormant. Before it is activated, we want "
1163,DOCTOR: You want the human factor introduced. I see. 
1164,DALEK: You will obey us. 
1165,DOCTOR: I will make up my own mind! 
1166,"WATERFIELD: Do not antagonise them, Doctor. They will destroy your time"
1167,machine. 
1168,"DOCTOR: And if I agree, it means the creation of a race of super"
1169,"Daleks. My Tardis. I have no choice, do I. Very well, I agree. "
1170,DALEK: The human being with you must not be aware of the trial. 
1171,DOCTOR: I quite understand. 
1172,DALEK: Make him begin the test. 
1173,(The Dalek goes into the mirrored room.) 
1174,DOCTOR: What must Jamie do? 
1175,MAXTIBLE: Attempt to rescue Waterfield's daughter.
1176,
1177,[Maxtible's sitting room]
1178,
1179,(Jamie is waiting when Mollie shows in Ruth and
1180,Terrall.) 
1181,"MOLLIE: There we are, sir. "
1182,"RUTH: Thank you, Mollie. Arthur, I'd like you to meet Mister McCrimmon."
1183,
1184,TERRALL: May I ask what you are doing in this house? 
1185,JAMIE: I was just about to ask you the same thing. 
1186,"RUTH: Oh, you gentlemen have been introduced? "
1187,"JAMIE: Aye, we've met. "
1188,"TERRALL: It seems, Ruth, your father has the oddest collection of house"
1189,guests these days. 
1190,"RUTH: Now, Arthur, please. You must forgive him, Mister McCrimmon. "
1191,"JAMIE: Ah, it's becoming a habit. "
1192,TERRALL: I don't care for insolence. 
1193,"JAMIE: Well, I'm not keen on arrogance myself. "
1194,"RUTH: Why, you bite at each other as if you were old enemies. "
1195,JAMIE: I'm sorry if I seem rude. 
1196,"RUTH: Come, I want you to be friends. Won't you be so, to please me? "
1197,(Terrall has another painful attack.) 
1198,"RUTH: Arthur? Arthur, what is it? "
1199,(Terrall runs from the room.) 
1200,RUTH: Excuse me. Arthur! What's the matter? 
1201,"(Ruth follows Terrall. Shortly afterwards, Mollie enters.) "
1202,MOLLIE: Sir? 
1203,"JAMIE: Yes? Oh, I wish you'd call me Jamie. "
1204,"MOLLIE: Oh, I couldn't do that, sir. What would the master say? "
1205,"JAMIE: Oh, who cares? What can I do for you? "
1206,"MOLLIE: If you'd tell me where your bags are, sir, yours and the"
1207,"Doctor, I'll have them taken up to your room. "
1208,"JAMIE: Aye. Well, Mollie "
1209,MOLLIE: Listen to me. Have them taken. I daresay I'll be doing it
1210,meself! 
1211,"JAMIE: You see, we didn't have time to pick up the luggage. It'll be"
1212,following. 
1213,MOLLIE: Oh. 
1214,JAMIE: Why do you say you'll be doing it yourself? 
1215,"MOLLIE: Well, they do say, sir, that the house is haunted. Mister"
1216,"Kitson, the butler, left, and cook and the two footmen are complaining"
1217,again. 
1218,JAMIE: Haunted? 
1219,"MOLLIE: Mmm. But, I've never heard anything, sir. I sleep like a log"
1220,and always have. 
1221,"JAMIE: Aye. Well, I'm glad you've got over the fright you had. "
1222,"MOLLIE: Oh, yes, that horrible man. Miss Ruth said it was all a game,"
1223,"but I don't know, sir. I've never fainted before, sir. Truly I haven't."
1224,
1225,"JAMIE: Not sir, Jamie. Tell me about Arthur Terrall. "
1226,"MOLLIE: Miss Ruth's fianc�, sir? "
1227,JAMIE: Aye. 
1228,"MOLLIE: Oh. Oh, he's a kind man, sir. Usually. "
1229,JAMIE: Usually? 
1230,"MOLLIE: Mmm. Well, when he's a bit odd or his temper's up, as it has"
1231,"been lately, I says to myself, Inkerman, and then it's all right. "
1232,JAMIE: Inkerman? 
1233,"MOLLIE: Yes sir. He was out in the Crimea, he was. They do say Mister"
1234,Terrall was wounded out there. 
1235,(The Doctor enters quietly.) 
1236,"MOLLIE: Do you know, my uncle was killed at Inkerman, sir. So, you see,"
1237,"I do know what it's like with soldiers. Oh! oh, I'm sorry, sir. "
1238,"DOCTOR: It's all right, Mollie. "
1239,MOLLIE: I didn't mean to. 
1240,DOCTOR: Never mind. 
1241,"MOLLIE: Well, cook said to me that if I did some dusting it would be"
1242,all right. 
1243,"DOCTOR: That'll do. Yes, Mollie, thank you very much. It's all right. "
1244,"MOLLIE: You won't tell the master, will you? "
1245,DOCTOR: I wouldn't dream of telling him. 
1246,"MOLLIE: Thank you, sir. Sorry. "
1247,DOCTOR: Thank you very much. Bye bye. 
1248,(Mollie leaves.) 
1249,DOCTOR: You'll have to brush up on your history. I can't be around to
1250,"cover up for you all the time. Now then, in the Crimean War, the"
1251,"English, the French and the Turks fought the Russians. "
1252,"JAMIE: Oh, forget about all that! "
1253,"DOCTOR: Oh, I thought you'd be interested. I watched the Charge of the"
1254,Light Brigade. Magnificent folly. 
1255,"JAMIE: Look, where've you been? "
1256,"DOCTOR: Oh, just looking around. "
1257,"JAMIE: Aye. What for, the Tardis? "
1258,"DOCTOR: Jamie, you're in a temper! "
1259,"JAMIE: Oh, am I? Is that bad, then? Does that mean I won't be"
1260,co-operative. I won't do everything I'm told? 
1261,DOCTOR: What was that? 
1262,JAMIE: I overheard you and Waterfield. 
1263,DOCTOR: You were eavesdropping. 
1264,"JAMIE: Well, whatever it is, I don't like what you're doing. "
1265,"DOCTOR: Now, you listen to me, Jamie! "
1266,"JAMIE: No, Doctor. You're forgetting the Tardis was stolen and a man"
1267,"was murdered. Now, how am I supposed to tell when I see you as friendly"
1268,as you like with the murderer. 
1269,DOCTOR: Waterfield did not murder that man! 
1270,"JAMIE: All right, then. But he stole the Tardis and that still makes"
1271,him a thief. 
1272,DOCTOR: The Daleks forced him to! 
1273,"JAMIE: The Daleks! You keep telling me about the Daleks, and I haven't"
1274,"even seen one. You're always on about them, but where are they? "
1275,"DOCTOR: Now, you listen to me. "
1276,"JAMIE: No, you'll not get round me this time, Doctor. You're up to"
1277,something with Waterfield and Maxtible. Now what is it? Some scientific
1278,"invention? Ah, here's your friend. "
1279,DOCTOR: Just a little argument. 
1280,WATERFIELD: I heard voices raised. 
1281,JAMIE: That's not all you'll hear! 
1282,DOCTOR: Jamie seems to think that I'm lying to him. 
1283,"JAMIE: Well, aren't you? "
1284,DOCTOR: He doesn't believe the Daleks are here. 
1285,WATERFIELD: It's the truth. 
1286,"JAMIE: Aye, the truth you told Arthur Terrall, maybe, that your"
1287,daughter was in Paris. 
1288,WATERFIELD: I had to tell him that. 
1289,JAMIE: So you've got another story to tell me? 
1290,WATERFIELD: I tell you that the Daleks are holding my daughter prisoner
1291,"in the south wing of this house, Mister McCrimmon. "
1292,"JAMIE: Then why don't you try and get her back, ay? What are you doing?"
1293,
1294,"DOCTOR: Well, what can I do? Now, be fair, Jamie. Waterfield's tied"
1295,"hand and foot because of his daughter, and we're tied hand and foot"
1296,because of the Tardis! 
1297,"JAMIE: Aye, and that's all you can think about, isn't it? The Tardis."
1298,"Well, you can all stand around doing nothing. I'm sick to death of it. "
1299,DOCTOR: Now just where are you going? 
1300,JAMIE: To be by myself for a bit. Do you mind? 
1301,"DOCTOR: No, not a bit. But one word of warning. Don't you try to be a"
1302,one-man army. You leave well alone. I won't have you ruining everything
1303,"trying to rescue Victoria Waterfield. Now, you understand? "
1304,(Jamie pushes the Doctor out of his way and leaves.) 
1305,"WATERFIELD: Well, are you sure you didn't go a little too far, Doctor? "
1306,DOCTOR: Adding a little fuel to the fire. Tell Maxtible that I'll be
1307,along to his laboratory shortly. 
1308,"WATERFIELD: Oh, very well, Doctor, if you're sure. "
1309,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, quite sure. Once our young friend has cooled his heels"
1310,"a bit, he'll launch off on his own. And you dropped the hint about the"
1311,south wing beautifully.
1312,
1313,[Stables]
1314,
1315,"TERRALL: Well, what is it? You wanted to see me. "
1316,"TOBY: Very good of you to talk to me, gov'nor. "
1317,"TERRALL: Well, never mind all that. I'll give you two minutes, no more."
1318,
1319,"TOBY: I want me rights. No more, no less. "
1320,"TERRALL: What do you mean, rights? "
1321,"TOBY: Half a guinea, you gave me, and it ain't what we said. "
1322,TERRALL: You were lucky to get anything. 
1323,TOBY: That ain't fair. 
1324,"TERRALL: You'll get no more from me. I warn you, keep away from this"
1325,house and this property. Find the nearest road to London and take it. 
1326,"TOBY: Oh, yeah, London, sir. Yeah. I daresay I could earn something for"
1327,me stories there. 
1328,TERRALL: Stories? 
1329,"TOBY: Oh, I won't detain an important gentleman like yourself. Like as"
1330,not me two minutes is up anyway. 
1331,"TERRALL: What do you mean, stories? "
1332,"TOBY: It's all right, sir. I'll take a stroll to London. "
1333,TERRALL: Don't play with me. 
1334,"TOBY: Get off me. If you must know, there's plenty who'd pay to hear"
1335,what I've got to tell them. 
1336,TERRALL: Indeed. 
1337,"TOBY: Yeah. You blows too hot and cold for me, telling me this one"
1338,minute and that the next and not paying up. 
1339,TERRALL: You know nothing. 
1340,"TOBY: Don't I, though? "
1341,TERRALL: Who'd believe you anyway? 
1342,"TOBY: Pay me off, and there's the end of it. "
1343,"TERRALL: Oh, blackmail is it? Get out. "
1344,"(Toby starts to leave, but Terrall has one of his attacks, grabs a"
1345,pitchfork and lunges at Toby. Toby manages to knock him out. He
1346,searches his pockets and finds gold coins and a set of keys.) 
1347,"TOBY: Maybe I don't know much to tell, but I'll wager I'll find"
1348,"something in the house that's worth me trouble. So I'll say thank you,"
1349,"Mister Terrall, sir. "
1350,[Maxtible's sitting room]
1351,
1352,(The moon shines down on the house. Mollie brings
1353,an oil lamp in.) 
1354,"JAMIE: It's only me, Mollie. "
1355,"MOLLIE: It's over here, sir. I took it from the master's study. "
1356,JAMIE: It's marvellous. Thank you. 
1357,"MOLLIE: Here, is this what you wanted? "
1358,(It's a plan of the house.) 
1359,"JAMIE: Perfect, yes. Let's see. This is the south wing here? "
1360,"MOLLIE: Yes sir, but it's been closed off. "
1361,JAMIE: Completely? 
1362,"MOLLIE: Oh no, sir. only because of some repairs about a twelve month"
1363,back. But the door may be locked. 
1364,JAMIE: Can you show me? 
1365,MOLLIE: All right. 
1366,(Jamie takes the map and lamp.) 
1367,"MOLLIE: What're you going to do, sir? "
1368,"JAMIE: I'm off to hunt a few ghosties, Mollie."
1369,
1370,[Workroom]
1371,
1372,DOCTOR: Every single one of Jamie's reactions will
1373,be recorded on these Dalek machines. 
1374,MAXTIBLE: And then transformed into thought patterns on silver wire. A
1375,wonderful creation. 
1376,"DALEK1: It is for you, Doctor, to select the major feelings to make up"
1377,this human factor. 
1378,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. I quite understand. "
1379,MAXTIBLE: We can rely on the Doctor to give us all cooperation. 
1380,DALEK: We shall watch your every move. 
1381,DOCTOR: I'm sure you will. And every step of Jamie's progress will be
1382,covered? 
1383,DALEK: Yes. 
1384,DALEK 2: The young human being is on his way. 
1385,MAXTIBLE: Then the recording machines can be set in action.
1386,
1387,[Alcove]
1388,
1389,(Mollie leads Jamie to the hidden doorway.) 
1390,JAMIE: Here? 
1391,"MOLLIE: Yes, sir. I once remember the master stepping away from here."
1392,"When he saw me, he was very cross and told me to keep away. "
1393,JAMIE: I see. 
1394,(Jamie searches the alcove.)
1395,
1396,[Maxtible's laboratory]
1397,
1398,(Toby has got into the house using Terrall's keys
1399,and is searching the place for loot. He looks into a packing case then
1400,is aware of movement on the other side of the room. A Dalek glides
1401,"towards him. Toby tries to run and gets killed, screaming as he dies.)"
1402,
1403,[Alcove]
1404,
1405,(The scream is heard through the house.) 
1406,MOLLIE: What was that? What was that? 
1407,"JAMIE: That was no ghost, Mollie, that's for sure. That was a human"
1408,voice. 
1409,"MOLLIE: Oh, sir. "
1410,"JAMIE: Look, Mollie, take the candle and go back to your room. Will you"
1411,do that? 
1412,"MOLLIE: Yes, sir. "
1413,"JAMIE: Now, do you want me to see you safely there? "
1414,"MOLLIE: No, no. I'll be all right. "
1415,(Mollie leaves. Jamie finds the candle and matches on the shelf and
1416,lights it. He finds greasy fingerprints on the doorframe and the hidden
1417,"switches. The door opens. As Jamie moves forward, hot wax drips onto"
1418,his fingers and he stops to wipe it off just as the metal spikes thud
1419,down in front of him. Jamie ducks under the spikes into the next
1420,corridor.) 
1421,[South wing]
1422,
1423,(Jamie sees movement in the moonlit corridor. It is
1424,Kemel.) 
1425,JAMIE: Hello. Who are you?

1427,
1428, [South wing]
1429,
1430,"(Kemel steps forward, arms outstretched. Jamie"
1431,ducks underneath them. Kemel grabs Jamie's fist and squeezes it. Jamie
1432,shoulders Kemel's stomach and the wrestler staggers back releasing his
1433,hand. They circle each other until Jamie elbows Kemel in the stomach
1434,"again with no effect. Kemel gets a glancing blow on Jamie, knocking him"
1435,"down. Then Kemel kicks out and Jamie grabs his foot, making him fall"
1436,"backwards onto a chair which breaks. Next, Kemel gets Jamie in a"
1437,headlock but Jamie gets his foot behind Kemel's knee and overbalances
1438,them both. They exchange kicks and blows until Kemel hits his head
1439,against the wall. Jamie goes into the nearest room and shuts the door.)
1440,
1441,[South wing room]
1442,
1443,(It is full of dusty furniture and packing cases.
1444,Kemel rushes in. Jamie dodges at the last moment and Kemel goes out
1445,through an open window. Jamie looks out to see Kemel sliding down a
1446,small roof until he is just hanging on to the gutter two stories above
1447,the ground. Jamie throws down a rope and braces himself as the wrestler
1448,"climbs back up to safety. Meanwhile, A Dalek takes an embroidered lace"
1449,handkerchief into Victoria's old room and puts it on the floor. Kemel
1450,climbs back through the window and shakes his head. Jamie goes back to
1451,the corridor and Kemel does not follow.)
1452,
1453,[Victoria's room]
1454,
1455,(Jamie passes an open doorway and sees the
1456,handkerchief on the floor. He looks around and goes to pick it up.
1457,Suddenly Kemel knocks him over onto the bed. An axe swings out of the
1458,wall and slices through the air where Jamie had been standing. The pair
1459,continue the search together. A Dalek watches them go.)
1460,
1461, [Dalek laboratory]
1462,
1463,DOCTOR: It took courage to fight Maxtible's Turkish
1464,wrestler. 
1465,DALEK: The Daleks are afraid of nothing and no-one. 
1466,DOCTOR: But Jamie saved the Turk's life. 
1467,DALEK: Human weakness. 
1468,"DOCTOR: If he hadn't, he would have died in that room of yours. If you"
1469,"want the human factor, a part of it must include mercy."
1470,
1471, [Maxtible's laboratory]
1472,
1473,WATERFIELD: What is he doing here? 
1474,"MAXTIBLE: (A common thief, come to see what he could steal. No mystery"
1475,here. 
1476,(A Dalek comes out of the mirror room.) 
1477,DALEK: The intruder was destroyed. 
1478,"WATERFIELD: Well, what are we to do? Where is the Doctor? He must be"
1479,told. 
1480,DALEK: No. 
1481,WATERFIELD: Why not? 
1482,DALEK: Obey me! 
1483,"MAXTIBLE: Waterfield, I beg of you, do not antagonise the, er, our"
1484,friends. 
1485,"WATERFIELD: Oh, why do you consistently avoid reality, Maxtible?"
1486,Another man has died. Can't you grasp that fact? 
1487,DALEK: You will hide the remains of the dead human intruder. 
1488,WATERFIELD: No! 
1489,DALEK: That is an order! 
1490,"MAXTIBLE: We must do as they say, Waterfield. We cannot anger them."
1491,"Here. Here, wrap the body in this. "
1492,WATERFIELD: No. 
1493,MAXTIBLE: We must. Have you lost your mind? Don't you want to see your
1494,daughter again? 
1495,WATERFIELD: There's no end to this. The hands of the Devil. 
1496,DALEK: Dispose of the body. Obey! 
1497,"MAXTIBLE: Waterfield, what is the matter with you? We are not to blame"
1498,for everything that has happened. No English judge or jury would find
1499,it in their hearts to convict us of one solitary thing. 
1500,WATERFIELD: It'll never come to that. 
1501,MAXTIBLE: And what may that remark mean? 
1502,"WATERFIELD: I have one purpose only, to see my daughter out of the"
1503,"hands of those foul monsters. When that is achieved, I shall confess my"
1504,part in all that has happened. 
1505,"(As Waterfield finishes wrapping Toby's corpse in a sheet, Maxtible"
1506,opens a drawer in his workbench and removes a small pistol which he
1507,slips into his coat. Waterfield struggles to drag the body to the
1508,door.) 
1509,WATERFIELD: You must help me. 
1510,"MAXTIBLE: I am at your heels, my dear sir."
1511,
1512,[South wing]
1513,
1514,(Kemel helps Jamie to a window for some fresh air.)
1515,
1516,"JAMIE: That's better, thank you. Aye, you're an odd one. I'll say that."
1517,"Aye, well, I suppose we're both a bit touched, eh? Knocking each other"
1518,"about the place and saving one another's lives. You don't say much, do"
1519,you? 
1520,(Kemel touches his lips and shakes his head.) 
1521,"JAMIE: Oh, I see. You can't talk. Aye. Well, you're a sight better than"
1522,a number of people I know who can. I wonder what your name is? 
1523,(The Turk writes his name in the dust.) 
1524,"JAMIE: Kemel? Well, I'm Jamie. "
1525,(Kemel bows over Jamie's hand.) 
1526,"JAMIE: Hey, what is that? Now, come on now. I want none of that. We're"
1527,"to be friends, d'you hear? Friends. "
1528,(Kemel sees the handkerchief Jamie is holding.) 
1529,JAMIE: Aye. 
1530,(Kemel points to the initials on it.) 
1531,JAMIE: V.W. I know. Victoria Waterfield. 
1532,(Kemel pulls a piece of folded paper from his belt. It contains a
1533,pressed flower.) 
1534,"JAMIE: Oh, Miss Waterfield gave you the flower? You like her? Of"
1535,course. Then what are we fighting for? Do you not know what I'm doing
1536,"here, Kemel? Victoria Waterfield is being held a prisoner here"
1537,"somewhere. Together? Aye, we'll go together. There's no one I'd rather"
1538,have with me.

1542,(The Doctor adjusts the recording machine.)
1543,
1544,[Stables]
1545,
1546,(Waterfield and Maxtible carry in Toby's body and
1547,put it in a stall.) 
1548,WATERFIELD: What was that? Did you hear it? 
1549,MAXTIBLE: Control your nerves. 
1550,WATERFIELD: But there was a noise. 
1551,"MAXTIBLE: Waterfield, go back to the house. "
1552,"WATERFIELD: No, we have a task to perform. "
1553,"MAXTIBLE: Waterfield, I am sick to death of you. "
1554,WATERFIELD: What? 
1555,"MAXTIBLE: I take you into my house, you and your daughter, provide for"
1556,you. 
1557,"WATERFIELD: Yes, I know everything that you've done. "
1558,MAXTIBLE: Small thanks do I get for it. I did not bring these terrible
1559,"creatures here deliberately, you know that. Am I to blame for"
1560,everything? 
1561,"WATERFIELD: No, no. "
1562,MAXTIBLE: It is your daughter they have kidnapped. One moment you beg
1563,"me to do everything I can to rescue her, next moment you blame me. "
1564,"WATERFIELD: Yes, I don't mean it like that. It's the price. First"
1565,"Kennedy, now this fellow. How many people must die so that my daughter"
1566,can live? 
1567,MAXTIBLE: We are not the murderers. 
1568,"WATERFIELD: No, just the silent partners. But we're equally to blame"
1569,because we stand by and do nothing. 
1570,"MAXTIBLE: Go back to the house, Waterfield. I understand you are under"
1571,a stress. You try and get some sleep. 
1572,WATERFIELD: Sleep? I've not had one good night's rest since this
1573,started. 
1574,"MAXTIBLE: Well, you go back to your room. Near the end now. You have"
1575,done enough. 
1576,(Waterfield leaves. Maxtible aims his pistol at his back. Terrall steps
1577,out of the shadows and knocks the gun away.) 
1578,MAXTIBLE: What are you doing? 
1579,TERRALL: Waterfield does not die yet. 
1580,MAXTIBLE: He says he will confess everything. 
1581,TERRALL: Go back to the laboratory. I will dispose of the body. You
1582,will obey. You will obey!
1583,
1584,[South wing]
1585,
1586,(Jamie and Kemel hide in an alcove as a Dalek goes
1587,past.) 
1588,"JAMIE: Wait. Never mind about those, Kemel, unless they catch sight of"
1589,us. We seem to be going in the right direction. 
1590,"(They follow the Dalek at a distance, but they are being monitored in"
1591,the Dalek laboratory. Jamie
1592,touches a small button in the wall at waist height and an alarm
1593,sounds.) 
1594,JAMIE: Down! 
1595,(A spotlight glares down and a huge ball on a pendulum swings between
1596,"them, just missing their heads as they lie on the floor. Jamie and"
1597,Kemel continue along the corridor very carefully.)
1598,
1599,[Dalek laboratory]
1600,
1601,(The Doctor makes more adjustments.) 
1602,DALEK: We do not trust you. What thoughts are you using now? 
1603,"DOCTOR: Human beings have five senses. Sight, hearing, taste, smell and"
1604,"touch. But there is instinct, too. Jamie used instinct to avoid your"
1605,trap.
1606,
1607,[Banqueting hall]
1608,
1609,(The corridor ends in a large hall with an open
1610,"fireplace, and a minstrel's gallery at the far end. As Jamie watches,"
1611,two Daleks enter and look up at the gallery. A door opens and Victoria
1612,steps out.) 
1613,DALEK: Name? 
1614,VICTORIA: Victoria. 
1615,DALEK: Louder. 
1616,VICTORIA: Victoria! Victoria Waterfield! You know my name! 
1617,DALEK: Silence. Inspection is over. Return to your room. 
1618,"JAMIE: She's very beautiful, Kemel. "
1619,(Kemel smiles and takes a mace from the wall.) 
1620,"JAMIE: What are you going to do with that? You'll attack the Daleks,"
1621,"draw them off down the corridor, while I go up there and rescue her"
1622,"somehow? It's too dangerous, Kemel. Besides, it needs two of us up"
1623,"there. Oh, but how?"
1624,
1625,[Dalek laboratory]
1626,
1627,DALEK: What is the significance of this thought
1628,pattern? 
1629,DOCTOR: Suicidal attacks to gain an objective. Postulate.
1630,Self-preservation is a strong human factor. Jamie and his new friend
1631,"are determined to succeed, but finding the girl is only part. Getting"
1632,her away is another.

1634,[Trophy room]
1635,
1636,(Terrall drags Mollie inside.) 
1637,"TERRALL: You'll come in here, Mollie, and explain yourself. "
1638,"MOLLIE: Oh, sir, please, sir, You're hurting me! "
1639,"TERRALL: Now, what is this hysterical nonsense? "
1640,"MOLLIE: But, sir, I heard Miss Victoria's voice. "
1641,"TERRALL: Did she say how the weather was in Paris? That's where she is,"
1642,Mollie. 
1643,"MOLLIE: Well, I know that, sir, but I heard her speaking. "
1644,TERRALL: Where? 
1645,"MOLLIE: I was walking past the big fireplace in the hall, sir, and her"
1646,voice sort of floated out of it. 
1647,TERRALL: Will you explain how you could possibly hear Miss Waterfield's
1648,voice when she's in Paris? 
1649,"MOLLIE: I know it can't be, sir, but I heard her as plain as anything. "
1650,"TERRALL: Anyway, what were you doing in the hall? "
1651,"MOLLIE: Oh, well. I wasn't doing anything wrong, sir. "
1652,TERRALL: What were you doing in this part of the house at this hour? 
1653,"MOLLIE: Oh, I don't know. "
1654,"TERRALL: You do know, and you'll tell me! "
1655,(Ruth is in the doorway.) 
1656,RUTH: Arthur! 
1657,TERRALL: I found this child creeping about the corridors. 
1658,MOLLIE: I haven't done anything. 
1659,TERRALL: Be quiet! 
1660,"MOLLIE: Yes, sir. "
1661,TERRALL: She is miles from her room. Should have been in bed an hour
1662,since. 
1663,"RUTH: Did you have extra work, Mollie? "
1664,"MOLLIE: Yes, Miss Ruth. I did. "
1665,TERRALL: You're a liar! 
1666,"MOLLIE: Well, I haven't done anything, Miss. I haven't took nothing. "
1667,"RUTH: Arthur, the poor child's frightened out of her senses. "
1668,"TERRALL: It's nothing but play acting. She's a mean, snivelling little"
1669,minx. 
1670,"MOLLIE: But I haven't done anything, miss. "
1671,TERRALL: Go to the sitting room and wait there. Mister Maxtible will
1672,decide what to do with you. 
1673,"MOLLIE: But sir, I "
1674,TERRALL: Do as you are told! 
1675,"RUTH: Mollie, it's all right. Everything will be all right. "
1676,(Mollie leaves.) 
1677,"RUTH: Arthur, tell me what's wrong. "
1678,TERRALL: Wrong? Why should something be wrong? 
1679,RUTH: Has my father influenced you in some way? 
1680,"TERRALL: No, not your father. "
1681,"RUTH: Come away with me, please. I somehow feel if we delay, it'll be"
1682,too late. 
1683,TERRALL: I can't go. Not yet.
1684,
1685,[Maxtible's laboratory]
1686,
1687,MAXTIBLE: I have done everything you have asked me
1688,to. You wanted an agency here on Earth to plan and prepare things for
1689,you. I have been that agency. Will you please tell those who give you
1690,orders that I am getting tired of waiting. 
1691,DALEK: Do you threaten the Daleks? 
1692,"MAXTIBLE: Oh, surely threatening is not necessary. We have a"
1693,"partnership, an understanding. "
1694,DALEK: You have obeyed us. 
1695,MAXTIBLE: You have a strange way of putting things. I prefer to say
1696,"that you have asked for certain services, I have provided those"
1697,services punctually and efficiently. Now you really must look to your
1698,side of the bargain. It is not beyond me to ruin the entire enterprise.
1699,
1700,(The Dalek knocks Maxtible down.) 
1701,DALEK: Do not threaten! Obey! 
1702,"MAXTIBLE: Yes. Very well, I understand. "
1703,DALEK: Obey the Daleks. 
1704,"MAXTIBLE: No, please. Please wait! The secret. The secret. You promised"
1705,to give it to me. That is why I have done all this. 
1706,DALEK: The Daleks know many secrets. You will learn the most important.
1707,
1708,(The Dalek goes into the mirrored room.) 
1709,MAXTIBLE: I must not be frightened of them. It's just their way.
1710,They're different people. Alien. But they will tell me. Of course they
1711,will! 
1712,RUTH: Father? 
1713,"MAXTIBLE: Ruth, I told you not to come in here. "
1714,RUTH: I had to. 
1715,MAXTIBLE: Under any circumstances. 
1716,"RUTH: Father, I simply had to. I heard you speaking to someone and"
1717,there's no-one here. And Arthur is involved in some way. 
1718,"MAXTIBLE: Ah, Arthur. Yes. "
1719,RUTH: Why has he become so changed? And Victoria Waterfield. Where is
1720,she? 
1721,"MAXTIBLE: My child, these are questions that I cannot answer. But, my"
1722,"dear, I will tell you one thing. One thing only, and then perhaps you"
1723,may understand why there are secrets to be kept. You see this? 
1724,RUTH: What is it? 
1725,"MAXTIBLE: A piece of ordinary metal. Of very little value, would you"
1726,not say so? 
1727,RUTH: I suppose so. 
1728,"MAXTIBLE: What does it weigh? A few pounds? Five, six, shall we say?"
1729,"For centuries now, men have searched for the greatest secret of all."
1730,"Some say it was known to the ancient alchemists, some say that the"
1731,"secret never existed at all, but still the stories and the rumours, and"
1732,the search goes on. 
1733,RUTH: What secret? 
1734,MAXTIBLE: The transmutation of metal into gold. Changing metal into
1735,"gold. Now, perhaps, do you begin to understand a little? To possess"
1736,such a secret would mean power and influence beyond all imagination.
1737,And I am about to discover this secret. Nothing will stop me. Nothing!
1738,Nobody!

1760,(Jamie grabs Kemel's hand and helps him to safely just before the
1761,railing breaks. Jamie taps on the door.)

1776,"VICTORIA: Kemel, my dear friend. "
1777,"JAMIE: Aye, he's a good friend, right enough, Miss Waterfield. "
1778,VICTORIA: And you? 
1779,"JAMIE: Introductions in a moment, if you please. First, I'd like to"
1780,"make us a little bit more secure. Kemel, if we lash this bedstead"
1781,"across the door, it might just hold. Rope! That's it. We could do with"
1782,"a chest against it, I'm thinking. Another one on top, ay? Well now,"
1783,"they can't get in and we can't get out. So, where does that put us? Oh."
1784,"Jamie McCrimmon. I, er, I came to give you this. "
1785,(Jamie hands over the handkerchief.) 
1786,
1787,[Trophy room]
1788,
1789,(The Doctor pours himself a glass of wine.) 
1790,DOCTOR: Are you sure you won't join me? 
1791,"TERRALL: No, I won't. I very rarely touch it. "
1792,"DOCTOR: Oh, dear. Well, something else, perhaps? "
1793,TERRALL: No. Thank you. 
1794,"DOCTOR: I know. Let me ring for some food. Now, do join me? "
1795,TERRALL: No! You seem determined to involve me. 
1796,"DOCTOR: Yes, I do, don't I? "
1797,TERRALL: This is a large house. I prefer my own company. 
1798,"DOCTOR: Oh, how very unsociable. "
1799,"TERRALL: Yes, possibly. No doubt you will enjoy your libation in one of"
1800,the other rooms. 
1801,"DOCTOR: Liba? Oh. No, thank you. I'm perfectly happy here, thank you."
1802,I'm perfectly happy. 
1803,(The Doctor inspects the glass cases around the walls.) 
1804,"DOCTOR: What an extraordinary collection, isn't it? "
1805,(Terrall takes a sword from the wall.) 
1806,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm so sorry. You didn't, you weren't in the mood for"
1807,"talking, were you? "
1808,TERRALL: Shouldn't you be helping Waterfield and Maxtible with their
1809,experiment? 
1810,"DOCTOR: Yes, but I thought I'd have a little rest. I wanted to talk to"
1811,you. 
1812,"TERRALL: About what, pray? "
1813,"DOCTOR: About you, Mister Terrall. You interest me. Do you know"
1814,"something? Ever since I came to this house, I, why, this is Circassian,"
1815,surely. 
1816,TERRALL: Do I know what? 
1817,"DOCTOR: Circassian. Ever since I came to this house, I have never seen"
1818,"you eat or drink anything. Now, that's curious, isn't it? "
1819,TERRALL: I dine alone. 
1820,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'd thought of that. But Waterfield has never seen you eat"
1821,or drink either. 
1822,TERRALL: You seem to be a devotee of Edgar Allan Poe. 
1823,"DOCTOR: Oh, do I? "
1824,TERRALL: However it isn't wise to make assumptions. 
1825,(Terrall gestures at the Doctor with the sword.) 
1826,TERRALL: Nor to meddle in affairs which are none of your business. 
1827,"DOCTOR: Touch�. Oh, look. "
1828,(Terrall rests the sword on a sideboard as the Doctor holds out his
1829,metal cup towards it.) 
1830,"DOCTOR: A perfectly ordinary sword, and yet it appears to be magnetic."
1831,"And see. Directly you let go it loses its magnetism. Now, if I didn't"
1832,"know better, Mister Terrall, I'd say that you were full of some sort of"
1833,electricity. 
1834,WATERFIELD: Doctor? Excuse me. You're wanted. 
1835,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. Excuse me. "
1836,"TERRALL: Doctor. No doubt you're a keen student of human nature, but"
1837,some things are better left alone. 
1838,"DOCTOR: No, Mister Terrall, I am not a student of human nature. I am a"
1839,"professor of a far wider academy, of which human nature is merely a"
1840,part. All forms of life interest me. 
1841,"WATERFIELD: I'm sorry to interrupt you Doctor, but it's something"
1842,rather urgent. 
1843,(The Doctor follows Waterfield from the room. Terrall pours himself a
1844,"glass of wine, but before he can take a sip, he has another of his"
1845,attacks.) 
1846,"VOICE : Obey, obey, obey! "
1847,"(Terrall falls to his knees, clutching his head in agony.)"
1848,
1849, [Lumber room]
1850,
1851,JAMIE: And so the Doctor and I were brought to the
1852,house. 
1853,VICTORIA: Why did you risk your life to try and rescue me? 
1854,JAMIE: Would you like some more water? 
1855,VICTORIA: You are too modest. It was a silly question. 
1856,"JAMIE: Tell me, how did they come to capture you in the first place? "
1857,"VICTORIA: I don't remember. And yet, I seem to remember in the back of"
1858,"my mind, somebody, oh, I can't recall who it was, telling me to walk."
1859,"And I obeyed, blindly and without interest. "
1860,"JAMIE: Aye. You were drugged, maybe? "
1861,VICTORIA: I simply don't know. The only thing I remember is waking up
1862,"in a bare room with one of those terrible, terrible things. "
1863,"JAMIE: Well, what do you remember before that, apart from this hazy"
1864,recollection? 
1865,"VICTORIA: I was reading in the sitting room, but I couldn't concentrate"
1866,because I was so worried about Papa. I think I fell asleep over my
1867,book. 
1868,"JAMIE: You see, how you came under the power of the Daleks is very"
1869,important. They can't have done as much as they have without some help.
1870,
1871,VICTORIA: Help? From somebody in the house? 
1872,"JAMIE: Yes, from someone who wants their plans to succeed. Someone who"
1873,drugged you or found a way of putting you under the power of the
1874,Daleks. 
1875,VICTORIA: But how? How could it be done without my knowing?
1876,
1877, [Trophy room]
1878,
1879,"(Maxtible is sitting in a wing chair, with Mollie"
1880,standing in front of him staring vacantly ahead. Terrall is watching
1881,from across the room as Maxtible swings a jewelled fob watch in front
1882,of Mollie.) 
1883,"MAXTIBLE: You are paying attention, Mollie? "
1884,"MOLLIE: Yes, sir. "
1885,MAXTIBLE: Then keep your eyes fixed on the jewel. See how the light
1886,"catches it? Every facet sparkles, does it not? "
1887,"MOLLIE: Yes, sir. "
1888,"MAXTIBLE: Flashing, flashing, like a collection of sparks. But I know"
1889,"you are tired, Mollie. You are tired, are you not? Tell me. "
1890,MOLLIE: I am tired. 
1891,"MAXTIBLE: Then close your eyes and sleep. You need have no fear, my"
1892,"child. A deep, heavy sleep. Oh, you are so exhausted. And now, in your"
1893,"sleep, you will hear only my voice. "
1894,MOLLIE: Only your voice. 
1895,"MAXTIBLE: You have been dreaming, Mollie. Dreaming that there are"
1896,"mysteries in this house, that all is not well. You have dreamt that you"
1897,heard the voice of Miss Waterfield. But it was all your imagination. It
1898,was nothing but a dream. Do you understand? 
1899,MOLLIE: Nothing but a dream. 
1900,"MAXTIBLE: That is correct. Now, when I tell you to open your eyes, you"
1901,will go back to your room and lie down on your bed. And when you
1902,"awaken, the dream will fade and you will forget all your suspicions,"
1903,"for they might be injurious to your health. Now, open your eyes. "
1904,(Mollie leaves.) 
1905,TERRALL: An excellent subject. I'd no idea that mesmerism was one of
1906,your accomplishments. 
1907,MAXTIBLE: How else do you suppose that I persuaded Victoria to go to
1908,the Daleks? 
1909,TERRALL: I see. What of the experiment? 
1910,MAXTIBLE: It progresses. 
1911,TERRALL: Are you sure of the Doctor? 
1912,"MAXTIBLE: No, but he is watched. "
1913,TERRALL: And Waterfield? 
1914,MAXTIBLE: Waterfield's usefulness is nearing it's end. Your
1915,intervention in the stables was untimely. 
1916,"TERRALL: Maxtible, help me! "
1917,MAXTIBLE: What do you mean? 
1918,TERRALL: I seem to be in the grip of something. Sometimes my thoughts
1919,"are clear, sometimes muddled. I don't know what's happened. Help me. "
1920,MAXTIBLE: I can only help you if you obey me. 
1921,TERRALL: But I obey our masters. 
1922,MAXTIBLE: I prefer to call them our colleagues. It is their wish that
1923,you should obey me. 
1924,TERRALL: You? But you would have killed Waterfield if they hadn't made
1925,me stop you. 
1926,MAXTIBLE: A slight misunderstanding on the part of our friends. But now
1927,it is your turn to obey. I have a task for you to perform. 
1928,"(Maxtible touches a hidden switch and a panel opens in the wall,"
1929,revealing a secret passageway.) 
1930,MAXTIBLE: This entrance leads to the south wing of my house and to a
1931,certain room. You will fetch Victoria Waterfield and bring her to me. 
1932,"TERRALL: But, Maxtible. "
1933,MAXTIBLE: Do as you are told! 
1934,VOICE : Obey! Obey! Obey! 
1935,MAXTIBLE: Well? 
1936,TERRALL: I will bring Victoria to you.
1937,
1938, [Maxtible's laboratory]
1939,
1940,WATERFIELD: Is it finished? 
1941,DOCTOR: Very nearly. Jamie was magnificent. But then I knew he would
1942,"be. He produced a whole battery of emotions, each one of which is"
1943,"imprinted in here, see? "
1944,(The Doctor holds up one of three glass capsules full of fine wiring.) 
1945,WATERFIELD: The human factor? 
1946,"DOCTOR: Well, a part of it at least. The better part. Courage, pity,"
1947,"chivalry, friendship, even compassion. Some of the virtues. "
1948,WATERFIELD: In there? 
1949,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's a positronic brain. We're going to implant one of"
1950,these into each of these three Daleks here. The dormant ones. 
1951,WATERFIELD: So the end is in sight? 
1952,DOCTOR: Perhaps. 
1953,WATERFIELD: What happens when the capsule comes into contact with the
1954,brain of the Dalek and starts to influence it? 
1955,DOCTOR: Perhaps it'll drive them insane. 
1956,WATERFIELD: Or turn them into super-beings? 
1957,"DOCTOR: Well, that is their purpose. At least, I imagine it is. I can't"
1958,help feeling that there's more in this than meets the eye. 
1959,DALEK: You have completed the experiment? 
1960,"DOCTOR: Yes, the three capsules are nearly ready. "
1961,DALEK: Stand in front of the cabinet and speak when you have finished. 
1962,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes. I understand. "
1963,"DALEK: Doctor, be careful. "
1964,(The Dalek goes back into the mirrored room.) 
1965,WATERFIELD: Doctor? 
1966,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
1967,WATERFIELD: You can't. You mustn't do it. 
1968,DOCTOR: What do you mean? 
1969,WATERFIELD: You must stop the experiment. 
1970,"DOCTOR: Oh, you should have thought of that some time ago. "
1971,WATERFIELD: I know. 
1972,DOCTOR: It's no use having a conscience now. 
1973,WATERFIELD: But before it's too late. 
1974,DOCTOR: It was too late when they took away your daughter. It was too
1975,late when you stole my Tardus and lured me to this house and this
1976,century. 
1977,"WATERFIELD: Yes, but what are we doing? What are we really doing?"
1978,Turning these creatures into super-beings. 
1979,DOCTOR: Homo superiense. 
1980,WATERFIELD: Adding all that is best and finest in human nature to all
1981,that is brilliant and superior in them. They'll be unbeatable. 
1982,DOCTOR: That is their purpose. 
1983,WATERFIELD: But you're making over the whole world to them. Don't you
1984,"realise that? Our world, our future. They will enslave us for all time."
1985,
1986,"DOCTOR: That, Mister Waterfield, remains to be seen. "
1987,(The Doctor turns back to his work. Waterfield sees the metal bar that
1988,Kemel bent and picks it up. The Doctor grabs his arm before he can
1989,strike.) 
1990,DOCTOR: Attacking me will do no good. Now listen. You've done all of
1991,this because of your daughter. Jamie is with her now and they're both
1992,still in the power of the Daleks. They must be set free! 
1993,"WATERFIELD: And sacrifice a whole world. A history, past, present and"
1994,future? Destroy an entire race? 
1995,DOCTOR: Yes. I don't think you quite realise what you're saying. But
1996,"yes, it may come to that. It may very well come to that."
1997,
1998, [Lumber room]
1999,
2000,"JAMIE: So, with the Dalek's eye stick pointing"
2001,"forward, Kemel and I were able to tiptoe up behind him, throw the rope"
2002,over his head and throw him into the fire. 
2003,(Kemel gestures at the packing cases barricading the door. Liquid is
2004,coming in underneath them.) 
2005,VICTORIA: What are they doing? 
2006,"JAMIE: They must be trying to get through. You'd better stand back,"
2007,Miss Waterfield. 
2008,VICTORIA: Why not break the door down? They're strong enough. 
2009,JAMIE: I don't know. Maybe they want us alive. I just don't know. Is it
2010,"hot? Aye, well, there's no smoke. It could be one of their newfangled"
2011,"inventions trying to melt their way through. Look, you'd better stand"
2012,"right back. Why didn't they try before this, is what I don't"
2013,"understand. Anyway, we'll make it as hard for them as we possibly can."
2014,"Come on, Kemel. Excuse me. Take this. That's it. That one too. "
2015,(The men pile more boxes around the door. A panel in the wall slides
2016,open behind Victoria and Terrall enters.) 
2017,"JAMIE: What's puzzling me is, there were two on the way up here, and"
2018,there was a Dalek up here. And you were up 
2019,(Terrall pulls Victoria into the secret passage and the door closes.) 
2020,"JAMIE: Hey, Miss Waterfield! "
2021,VICTORIA : Jamie! 
2022,"JAMIE: Hey, did you hear it? Of course! Why didn't I use my head?"
2023,There's another way in and out of here. Come on! 
2024,(Jamie searches for the opening switch as the barricade begins to
2025,crumble. They open the panel and escape just before the Daleks break
2026,in.)
2027,
2028, [Secret passage]
2029,
2030,"(At the trophy room door, Victoria frees herself"
2031,"while Terrall tries to open it. Meanwhile, further back along the"
2032,passage.) 
2033,"JAMIE: Oh, no. Two ways to go. Kemel, you go that way. If it's a dead"
2034,"end, follow me. "
2035,"(Terrall hears someone approaching, and goes into the trophy room."
2036,Jamie sees a slip of light coming from under the door. He searches for
2037,the switch.)
2038,
2039,[Trophy room]
2040,
2041,(Jamie pauses to get used to the bright light
2042,"again. Terrall attacks him with a sword, and misses. Jamie dodges his"
2043,"blade and gets his own sword from the far wall. They fence, and are"
2044,evenly matched. Jamie finally corners Terrall.) 
2045,JAMIE: Right. Where's Victoria Waterfield? 
2046,TERRALL: You'll never find her. 
2047,JAMIE: Tell me! 
2048,TERRALL Never! 
2049,(Jamie continues the fight. Ruth and Mollie appear in the doorway.) 
2050,"RUTH: Mollie, go and fetch the Doctor. Quick, hurry! "
2051,"MOLLIE: Yes, mistress. "
2052,RUTH: Arthur! Stop it. I implore you. Stop it. 
2053,TERRALL: Leave me! 
2054,"RUTH: Please, I implore you. Stop it! "
2055,"(Terrall suddenly drops his sword and falls to his knees, clutching his"
2056,head in agony.) 
2057,"DOCTOR: Jamie, what have you done? "
2058,JAMIE: But I can't understand it. He just collapsed. 
2059,"RUTH: Arthur, are you all right? What's happened to him? "
2060,DOCTOR: Do you want to save this man's life? 
2061,RUTH: What do you mean? 
2062,DOCTOR: Do you? 
2063,RUTH: Yes! 
2064,DOCTOR: Then take him away from here. As far away as possible. Go and
2065,"get the carriage round to the stables. You go too, Mollie. We'll bring"
2066,him out you. Now go along. 
2067,"RUTH: But, Doctor Oh, Mollie. "
2068,(The Doctor finds a slim black box inside Terrall's jacket.) 
2069,"DOCTOR: Yes, I thought he was under some sort of control. Come along. "
2070,TERRALL: The creatures. 
2071,"DOCTOR: Yes, don't worry about them. "
2072,"TERRALL: There's danger, I tell you. Some kind of danger. "
2073,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know there's danger. You must leave here immediately. "
2074,"TERRALL: The house, the creatures abroad. "
2075,DOCTOR: Now you leave them to us. Take Ruth Maxtible with you. She's
2076,waiting for you at the stables. 
2077,"TERRALL: Yes, very well. "
2078,JAMIE: Can you manage? 
2079,"TERRALL: Yes, I think so. Wait. There's something at the back of my"
2080,mind. Victoria Waterfield. I feel I've harmed her in some way. 
2081,DOCTOR: Victoria is safe and well. 
2082,TERRALL: You You're positive? 
2083,DOCTOR: I'm positive. Now we'll take care of her. You must leave
2084,immediately. 
2085,"TERRALL: Yes, if that's what you want. I'll find Ruth by the stables? "
2086,DOCTOR: Yes! 
2087,TERRALL: Yes. 
2088,(Terrall leaves.) 
2089,"JAMIE: Well, that's fine for Ruth Maxtible, but you lied about"
2090,Victoria. 
2091,"DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, and we must turn that lie into a truth."
2092,
2093, [Maxtible's laboratory]
2094,
2095,(Kemel's passageway brings him out at the top of
2096,the spiral stairs that lead down to the laboratory. Victoria is lying
2097,unconscious in front of the mirror room. Kemel kneels next to her.) 
2098,DALEK: Turn around. Pick up the human female. Obey. Obey! Hurry! Hurry!
2099,Move into the cabinet. Obey! Move! 
2100,"(Kemel carries Victoria inside and the Dalek follows. After a while,"
2101,"the Doctor, Jamie and Waterfield enter.) "
2102,"DOCTOR: Well, Jamie, the experiment's nearly over. I've had no sleep."
2103,"I've been up all night, but it's been worth it. "
2104,"JAMIE: Och, don't touch me! "
2105,"DOCTOR: Oh, now what's the matter? "
2106,JAMIE: Anyone would think this was a little game. 
2107,DOCTOR: No it is not a game. 
2108,"JAMIE: Of course it isn't, Doctor. People have died. The Daleks are all"
2109,"over the place, fit to murder the lot of us, and all you can say is"
2110,you've had a good night's work. 
2111,DOCTOR: Jamie. 
2112,"JAMIE: No, Doctor. Look, I'm telling you this. You and me, we're"
2113,finished. You're just too callous for me. Anything goes by the board.
2114,Anything at all. 
2115,"DOCTOR: That's just not true, Jamie. I've never held that the end"
2116,justifies the means. 
2117,"JAMIE: Och, words. What do I care about words? You don't give that much"
2118,for a living soul except yourself. 
2119,DOCTOR: I care about life. I care about human beings. Do you think I
2120,let you go through that Dalek test lightly? 
2121,"JAMIE: I don't know. Did you? Look, Doctor, just whose side are you on?"
2122,
2123,(Three Daleks come from the packing cases.) 
2124,"DOCTOR: It's all right, Jamie. They're friends. "
2125,JAMIE: Friends? 
2126,DOCTOR: Now don't get the wrong idea. They are the experiment. 
2127,(The Daleks gather round a swivel chair and play at pushing it.
2128,Maxtible enters and likes what he sees.) 
2129,"MAXTIBLE: Every feeling, every thought impulse you had during your"
2130,"attempt to rescue Victoria Waterfield, was recorded and made into a"
2131,small positronic brain and added to these Daleks. The human factor to
2132,"add to their own powers, to triumph over human beings. "
2133,"JAMIE: Well, how do you know they haven't succeeded? "
2134,"DOCTOR: Because human beings, Jamie, no matter how brilliant they may"
2135,"be, are always within reach of other human beings. Now then, it's all"
2136,"right, Jamie, don't worry. "
2137,"JAMIE: How do you know you can trust them, Doctor? "
2138,DOCTOR: What is it? 
2139,"(The Daleks close in on the Doctor, pushing him towards the chair. He"
2140,sits.) 
2141,DOCTOR: What do you want? Hmm? What are you up to? Ah! What are you
2142,doing? 
2143,"JAMIE: Doctor, where are they taking you? "
2144,DOCTOR: Where are you taking me? 
2145,(The Daleks push the chair around the room.) 
2146,"DOCTOR: Jamie, they're taking me for a ride! Jamie, they're playing a"
2147,game. It's a game! They're taking me for a ride! 
2148,"MAXTIBLE: A rather amusing little game, don't you think, Jamie? "

2151, [Maxtible's laboratory]
2152,
2153,"DOCTOR: We've done it! Maxtible, they've got the"
2154,"human factor. We've done it! What are they doing now? Look, they're all"
2155,joining in. They're playing train! 
2156,(The Doctor blows on his recorder.) 
2157,"DALEKS: Trains, trains, trains, trains. "
2158,"DOCTOR: Oh! Oh, now what is it? Oh, we're on a roundabout. They're"
2159,"playing roundabout. Oh, I'm getting dizzy. Oh, dear. Oh, I'm dizzy! Oh,"
2160,I'm dizzy. 
2161,"DALEKS: Diz-zy, diz-zy, dizzy, Doctor. "
2162,"DOCTOR: Maxtible, do you hear that? They've got a sense of humour. "
2163,MAXTIBLE: I'm glad you are so easily amused. 
2164,DOCTOR: Yes. 
2165,"MAXTIBLE: Well, I congratulate you, Doctor. They are almost human. "
2166,DOCTOR: They are. 
2167,MAXTIBLE: And I will now leave you to your little games. 
2168,(Maxtible leaves.) 
2169,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. "
2170,"JAMIE: Well, how old are they now, Doctor, mentally? "
2171,"DOCTOR: Oh, they're just young children, but they'll grow up very fast."
2172,"Within a matter of hours. Now, come here, all of you. Come along,"
2173,"gather round. Come here. Now then, come along, come along. "
2174,DALEK: Who is this? 
2175,"DOCTOR: Oh, this is Jamie. He's a friend. "
2176,"DALEK: Friend. Hello, friend. "
2177,"DOCTOR: Well say hello, Jamie. "
2178,JAMIE: Hello. 
2179,"DOCTOR: You know what a friend is, don't you? It's somebody who likes"
2180,"you, who wants to help you and share with you. "
2181,(The Doctor has been scratching a greek letter on the base of each
2182,Dalek.) 
2183,DOCTOR: There we are. 
2184,DALEK: What have you done? 
2185,"DOCTOR: I have given you all names. Alpha, Beta and Omega. "
2186,OMEGA: Alpha. 
2187,DOCTOR: Yes. 
2188,ALPHA: Beta. 
2189,DOCTOR: Yes. 
2190,BETA: Omega. 
2191,DOCTOR: Yes. 
2192,OMEGA: Alpha. 
2193,ALPHA: Beta. 
2194,BETA: Omega. 
2195,OMEGA: Alpha. 
2196,ALPHA: Beta. 
2197,BETA: Omega. 
2198,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes. Now, this is Jamie and I am Doctor. We are"
2199,friends. 
2200,"OMEGA: Friends, friends. "
2201,"ALPHA: Jamie, Doctor. "
2202,"DALEKS: Friends, friends. "
2203,OMEGA: We must go now. We are called. 
2204,"DOCTOR: Go? Called? Go where? What do you mean, go? "
2205,OMEGA: All Daleks are ordered to return to Skaro. 
2206,DOCTOR: Return to Skaro? But that's the Dalek plan. 
2207,OMEGA: Friend. 
2208,"JAMIE: But if the Daleks are returning to Skaro, where's Victoria? "
2209,"DOCTOR: Victoria! We left her in the secret passage. Come along, follow"
2210,me!
2211,(The Doctor and Jamie run up the spiral staircase. Maxtible and
2212,Waterfield enter.) 
2213,"MAXTIBLE: I assure you, my dear Waterfield, Victoria is perfectly safe."
2214,
2215,WATERFIELD: But where is she? 
2216,MAXTIBLE: The Daleks have released her. 
2217,WATERFIELD: Released her? 
2218,"MAXTIBLE: Yes, yes, yes, yes. "
2219,"WATERFIELD: Well then, where is she now? "
2220,"MAXTIBLE: She's probably lying down. Ruth will be taking care of her,"
2221,you may be sure of that. 
2222,"WATERFIELD: Not Ruth, no. I saw her and Mollie helping Arthur Terrall"
2223,into a dog-cart not half an hour since. 
2224,MAXTIBLE: Ruth and Terrall? 
2225,WATERFIELD: Yes. Surely you knew they were leaving? 
2226,"MAXTIBLE: Oh, yes, yes, indeed, yes. It slipped my memory. You see, I'm"
2227,"going for a little trip myself. No doubt, I shall join them. Well,"
2228,possibly she's taking a stroll in the garden. Go along and see. Go
2229,along and see. 
2230,WATERFIELD: Yes. 
2231,"MAXTIBLE: Well, go along, man! Go along and see. Find your Victoria. "
2232,(Waterfield leaves.) 
2233,"MAXTIBLE: Stupid, stupid girl. "
2234,(Maxtible takes a travelling bag from a cupboard. He notices a small
2235,"grey box on the floor. It is fastened down securely, so he open it to"
2236,see a complicated mechanism.) 
2237,DALEK: What are you doing? 
2238,MAXTIBLE: Merely looking. 
2239,DALEK: Do not touch the instrument. 
2240,MAXTIBLE: What is that box for? 
2241,DALEK: Do not question. You have your orders. 
2242,"MAXTIBLE: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. To bring the Doctor and his companion"
2243,to you here for our little trip. 
2244,DALEK: Yes. 
2245,MAXTIBLE: And then the secret. You will give it to me? 
2246,DALEK: Yes. 
2247,MAXTIBLE: The formula. The transmutation formula. 
2248,DALEK: Yes. Obey your order. Do not delay. 
2249,(The Dalek leaves. Waterfield watches Maxtible from the doorway as he
2250,returns to the box on the floor. It seems to contain a timing device.) 
2251,"MAXTIBLE: Doctor? Doctor? Doctor? Oh, Waterfield, how I'm delighted"
2252,you've come back. Now will you please go and find the Doctor and his
2253,"companion Jamie, and bring them here to me. It is a matter of some"
2254,urgency. 
2255,WATERFIELD: Maxtible? 
2256,"MAXTIBLE: Oh, what is it? "
2257,WATERFIELD: What have you arranged with the Daleks? 
2258,MAXTIBLE: The Daleks? Nothing. 
2259,WATERFIELD: What formula did they promise you? 
2260,MAXTIBLE: No formula whatever. 
2261,"WATERFIELD: What are you doing? You've sold yourself to them, haven't"
2262,you? 
2263,MAXTIBLE: You fool! 
2264,"WATERFIELD: Yes, I'm a fool. A fool not to have realised before that it"
2265,was you who brought all this misery down on us. 
2266,"MAXTIBLE: You never did understand anything, did you? Well, metal into"
2267,gold. That's what the Daleks are going to give me. Now do you begin to
2268,understand? The secret of the transmutation of metal into gold. 
2269,WATERFIELD: Do you imagine I care about that? Where's Victoria? 
2270,MAXTIBLE: I have not the remotest idea. 
2271,"WATERFIELD: Yes, you have, and you're going to tell me! Where is my"
2272,daughter? 
2273,MAXTIBLE: Get your hands off me. Let go of me! Murder! Murder! Murder!
2274,Murder! Murder! Murder! Murder! Murder! Oh. 
2275,"(Maxtible smashes a rack of test tubes against Waterfield's head,"
2276,knocking him down. A Dalek comes out of the mirror room and adjusts the
2277,control in the grey box.) 
2278,"MAXTIBLE: Oh, what are you doing? "
2279,DALEK: Where is the Doctor? 
2280,"MAXTIBLE: Well, I had no time to bring him. "
2281,DALEK: Hurry. That is an order. 
2282,MAXTIBLE: What is that box for? Will you tell me? 
2283,DALEK: We are destroying this area. 
2284,MAXTIBLE: But you can't do that. Turn it off! You cannot destroy my
2285,house! 
2286,DALEK: Bring the Doctor. Obey! Immediately! 
2287,"MAXTIBLE: But, the secret. If you destroy my laboratory, the secret is"
2288,useless. You promised me. They must be out of their minds. Destroy my
2289,"laboratory? The very idea. Well, well, but, oh goodness gracious me,"
2290,only two minutes. Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!
2291,"Doctor! Oh, you fool. Doctor! Doctor! "
2292,(Maxtible grabs his bag and runs into the mirror room. Waterfield sits
2293,up. Other Daleks return from the rest of the house.) 
2294,DALEK: All Daleks return to Skaro. 
2295,DALEK 2: All Daleks return to Skaro. 
2296,DALEK: And the prisoners? 
2297,DALEK 2: They are already in transit. 
2298,(The Daleks go into the mirror room. Waterfield stands as Jamie and the
2299,Doctor enter.) 
2300,WATERFIELD: Dalek. Doctor. 
2301,"DOCTOR: Waterfield, what's happened to you? "
2302,WATERFIELD: Doctor. Daleks going to destroy house. Can't turn it off. 
2303,DOCTOR: But this is a time switch. 
2304,"JAMIE: Well, if you can't turn it off, surely "
2305,"DOCTOR: No, wait a minute. Eighty nine, eighty eight, eighty seven."
2306,"Just about a minute, that's all we've got. "
2307,"JAMIE: Well, toss it out the window then. "
2308,DOCTOR: This isn't a firework. We'd have to toss this half a mile.
2309,"We'll have to follow the Daleks to Skaro. Jamie, open the doors. Come"
2310,along. 
2311,"WATERFIELD: Doctor, Doctor. "
2312,"JAMIE: Doctor, they're locked. They won't budge! "
2313,WATERFIELD: Cupboard in the alcove. The time machine. 
2314,"DOCTOR: Time machine? Jamie, give me a hand. Quickly. "
2315,(The Doctor and Jamie go to the cupboard and pull out the two sections
2316,of the transmat from the antique shop.)
2317,DOCTOR: Now the other one. Steady. 
2318,(They set them up and the Doctor tries to set the controls.)
2319,"JAMIE: Right. Now, where's Victoria? "
2320,"DOCTOR: Quick, Jamie, the time switch. "
2321,"JAMIE: Twenty eight, Doctor. Hey, Doctor, Kemel must have dropped this."
2322,
2323,DOCTOR: Jamie! 
2324,(It's the pressed flower.) 
2325,"JAMIE: We'll find Victoria, and Kemel too. "
2326,(The Doctor and Jamie help Waterfield to the time machine and they fade
2327,away as the countdown hits zero. KaBOOM!)
2328,
2329, [Skaro cell]
2330,
2331,"(Victoria is imprisoned again, in a plain cell with"
2332,Kemel.) 
2333,VICTORIA: Dear Kemel. Are any of the others here? 
2334,(Kemel shakes his head.) 
2335,VICTORIA: The Daleks? 
2336,(Kemel nods. A Dalek enters with Maxtible.) 
2337,DALEK: You will wait here. 
2338,"VICTORIA: Oh, Mister Maxtible. "
2339,MAXTIBLE: What are you doing here? 
2340,VICTORIA: Don't know. Nor even where here may be. 
2341,"MAXTIBLE: Oh, we've been transported to the Dalek planet, my dear. To"
2342,Skaro. 
2343,VICTORIA: I don't understand you. 
2344,MAXTIBLE: A little journey through space. 
2345,VICTORIA: They're taken us somewhere. Is that what you mean? Away from
2346,your house? 
2347,"MAXTIBLE: Oh, far away. Far, far away. "
2348,VICTORIA: But why? What do they want? 
2349,MAXTIBLE: I know why I am here. But why you are here I have not the
2350,faintest idea. 
2351,VICTORIA: You seem to understand them. Ask them. 
2352,MAXTIBLE: Don't be foolish girl. I shall do no such thing. 
2353,VICTORIA: And where's my father? 
2354,MAXTIBLE: I do not know. I am not a nursemaid to your father. 
2355,DALEK: Follow me. 
2356,"MAXTIBLE: Of course, I shall do my best for you, but the matter is"
2357,really entirely out of my hands. 
2358,(Maxtible leaves.) 
2359,"VICTORIA: It's no good. He won't help us. Don't worry, Kemel. I shall"
2360,"protect you. I shall see they do you no harm. Yes, I suppose it was a"
2361,bit silly. (Kemel shakes his head and flexes his muscles.) 
2362,"VICTORIA: You think so? I wish I did. Oh well, maybe between us we can"
2363,fight them. We must face it out together.
2364,
2365,[Skaro desert]
2366,
2367,"(The Doctor, Jamie and Waterfield are sheltering in"
2368,a rocky outcrop.) 
2369,WATERFIELD: And that is the Dalek city? 
2370,"DOCTOR: Yes, it is. "
2371,"JAMIE: I've scouted around, but I can't see any water. "
2372,"WATERFIELD: Oh, please don't bother. I feel much better. "
2373,DOCTOR: Are you sure? 
2374,WATERFIELD: Yes. 
2375,"DOCTOR: Come along, then. We must get along. "
2376,JAMIE: You mean just walk into the city? 
2377,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. The city is all around us. At least, it's beneath us."
2378,Come along. 
2379,(The Doctor takes them to a tunnel mouth in the rock face.) 
2380,JAMIE: How long have you known that's there? 
2381,DOCTOR: Not a sound. I think the Daleks are in for a little surprise.
2382,
2383, [Skaro corridor]
2384,
2385,BLACK: Where is the Doctor? 
2386,MAXTIBLE: I had no time to get him. 
2387,BLACK: No time? 
2388,MAXTIBLE: I was told my house was going to be destroyed. Why? 
2389,BLACK: You did not bring the Doctor? 
2390,MAXTIBLE: Everything I possess is in that house. Everything. What right
2391,had you or anyone to destroy it? 
2392,BLACK: Right? 
2393,"MAXTIBLE: All these years of labour, all these years of research,"
2394,"destroyed through this caprice of yours. My laboratory, the only real"
2395,"thing in the whole of my existence, destroyed. I, Theodore Maxtible,"
2396,"made a bargain with you, and I demand to know. Ah! ah! "
2397,BLACK: You have disobeyed a Dalek command. You must obey the Dalek
2398,command. 
2399,DALEKS: Exterminate. Destroy. 
2400,MAXTIBLE: It's not my fault. I swear it's not my fault. I No! 
2401,(An alarm sounds. The Black Dalek leaves.) 
2402,DALEK 2: Move. 
2403,MAXTIBLE: What is happening? What are you going to do with me? 
2404,DALEK 2: Obey. Move.
2405,
2406,[Skaro cell]
2407,
2408,(A grey then a black Dalek enter.) 
2409,GREY: These humans are still here. 
2410,BLACK: Then other humans are inside the city.
2411,(The Daleks leave.) 
2412,"VICTORIA: Other humans inside the city, Kemel. Listen! "
2413,DALEK : Emergency. Emergency. Human beings detected in city.
2414,Emergency! Emergency! 
2415,"VICTORIA: Maybe it's Jamie and the Doctor. Oh, Kemel, there's a chance."
2416,A chance. 
2417,DALEK : Intruders detected. Emergency! Emergency! Human beings
2418,detected in city. Emergency! Emergency! Intruders detected. All Daleks
2419,to observation stations. Repeat. All Daleks to observation stations.
2420,Emergency! 
2421,(The humans come out of a tunnel into a huge canyon. They have to sidle
2422,along a narrow ledge.)
2423,
2424,[Skaro corridor]
2425,
2426,BLACK: Stop! What is that mark? 
2427,OMEGA: That is my name. 
2428,BLACK: Name? 
2429,OMEGA: The Doctor gave it to me. 
2430,DALEK: Doctor? 
2431,OMEGA: Yes. He is my friend. 
2432,DALEK: Follow me. 
2433,"(The two Daleks move on, and shortly afterwards Kemel and Victoria are"
2434,escorted along.)
2435,
2436,[outside the Control room]
2437,
2438,(The control room is in darkness.) 
2439,DALEK: Remain here. 
2440,MAXTIBLE: What is happening? Do you know? They say there are other
2441,human beings in the city. 
2442,"VICTORIA: No. No, thank you. Why don't you answer me. You little"
2443,fool! 
2444,(Maxtible lunges at Victoria and Kemel intervenes.) 
2445,MAXTIBLE: No one can help you here. No one but me. 
2446,"DALEK: Silence. Follow me. You, wait. "
2447,MAXTIBLE: I can't see anything. 
2448,DALEK: Move! 
2449,MAXTIBLE: Where are you taking me? 
2450,(The Dalek takes Maxtible into the dark room. Maxtible screams.) 
2451,"VICTORIA: Oh, what are they doing to him? "
2452,DALEK: You follow. You will wait. 
2453,VICTORIA: I will do as you say. 
2454,DALEK: Move forward. Alone. 
2455, [Underground tunnel]
2456,
2457,(Below the control room somewhere.) 
2458,"JAMIE: That was a human voice, I tell you. "
2459,"DOCTOR: Perhaps it was, Jamie. "
2460,WATERFIELD: We must go more quickly. 
2461,(Victoria screams.) 
2462,JAMIE: Victoria! 
2463,"DOCTOR: No, you mustn't. "
2464,JAMIE: That was Victoria's voice. 
2465,DOCTOR: You can't. You'll go over the edge! 
2466,"DALEK: Doctor, I am your friend. "
2467,"JAMIE: One of your experiments, Doctor. For a moment I thought we were"
2468,done for. 
2469,DOCTOR: What is your name? 
2470,DALEK: Omega. 
2471,"DOCTOR: Oh, I see. "
2472,DALEK: I have come to lead you. 
2473,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
2474,(The Doctor slips on the ledge.) 
2475,JAMIE: Careful! 
2476,"(The Doctor sees the mark on the Dalek, and gets up.) "
2477,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm all right, thank you. Lead on. "
2478,DALEK: Follow me. 
2479,(The Doctor dodges ahead of the Dalek.) 
2480,DOCTOR: What was that screaming? 
2481,DALEK: A prisoner. 
2482,DOCTOR: Where? 
2483,DALEK: Follow me. I will show you. 
2484,(The Doctor flattens himself against the rock so the Dalek can pass.) 
2485,JAMIE: What are you doing? 
2486,(The Doctor pushes the Dalek off the ledge into the chasm.) 
2487,DOCTOR: Think I don't know my own mark? That wasn't the real Omega at
2488,all. 
2489,"JAMIE: Up to all sorts of tricks, aren't they? "
2490,"WATERFIELD: Oh, please. We must reach my daughter."
2491,
2492,[Skaro cell]
2493,
2494,"MAXTIBLE: I tell you, they forced me. They"
2495,"threatened to kill us all. First of all, they ordered me to scream and"
2496,I was to make you do the same. 
2497,VICTORIA: And you had to do as you were told? 
2498,"MAXTIBLE: I tell you, they threatened to kill me. "
2499,VICTORIA: You came up behind me in the dark and twisted my arm. 
2500,MAXTIBLE: And what else could I do? 
2501,"VICTORIA: Oh, if only I'd realised. Why do you think they wanted us to"
2502,scream like that? 
2503,MAXTIBLE: I've no idea. 
2504,VICTORIA: You know perfectly well. There are other people in the city.
2505,"They wanted to draw them on, trap them. Oh, if only I could have"
2506,"thought quickly. Oh, Kemel. "
2507,(The intruders climb out of a ventilation grille and walk along the
2508,corridor. A Dalek watches them go.)
2509,
2510, [Outside the control room]
2511,
2512,"DOCTOR: No. No, I don't like the look of this. Back"
2513,the way we came. 
2514,(Two Daleks block their way.) 
2515,BLACK: Follow me. 
2516,[Control room]
2517,
2518,(They follow the Black into the control room which
2519,gradually lights up. A big Dalek is seated on a
2520,dais and connected to its surrounding by lots of tubes.) 
2521,EMPEROR: Doctor! 
2522,JAMIE: Look at the size of that thing. 
2523,"EMPEROR: So, you are the Doctor. "
2524,DOCTOR: We meet at last. I wondered if we ever would. 
2525,EMPEROR: The experiment is over. 
2526,"DOCTOR: Yes, I have implanted the human factor in the three Daleks that"
2527,"you gave me. When I say run, run! "
2528,EMPEROR: Speak louder. 
2529,"DOCTOR: Promise me, Jamie. I was merely telling my friend that the day"
2530,of the Daleks is coming to an end. 
2531,EMPEROR: Explain. 
2532,DOCTOR: It's very simple. Somewhere in the Dalek race there are three
2533,"Daleks with the human factor. Gradually, they will come to question."
2534,They will persuade other Daleks to question. You will have a rebellion
2535,on your planet! 
2536,EMPEROR: No. 
2537,DOCTOR: I say yes. I've beaten you and I don't care what you do to me
2538,now. 
2539,EMPEROR: Silence. The human factor showed us what the Dalek factor was.
2540,
2541,DOCTOR: What? 
2542,JAMIE: What does that mean? 
2543,"EMPEROR: Without knowing, you have shown the Daleks what their own"
2544,strength is. 
2545,"WATERFIELD: While you were doing one thing, they were really making you"
2546,do another. 
2547,EMPEROR: The human factor is useless. 
2548,DOCTOR: You still have those three Daleks to contend with. 
2549,EMPEROR: They will be impregnated with the Dalek factor. Your
2550,"discovery, but your work is not over. "
2551,DOCTOR: I won't work for you. 
2552,EMPEROR: You will obey! 
2553,JAMIE: What is the Dalek factor? 
2554,"DOCTOR: You want me to guess? It means to obey, to fight, to destroy,"
2555,to exterminate. I won't do it. 
2556,EMPEROR: Watch! 
2557,(An alcove lights up to reveal...) 
2558,"JAMIE: The Tardis, Doctor! "
2559,EMPEROR: You will take the Dalek factor. You will spread it to the
2560,entire history of Earth!

2582,JAMIE: You mean to say he's worked against us all just for that? 
2583,"DOCTOR: People have done worse for less, Jamie. "
2584,"JAMIE: Look, it's daft though. Metal into gold's an old wives tale. "
2585,"DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know. The alchemists of the Middle Ages made"
2586,transmutation their main aim in life. 
2587,"JAMIE: Ah, they didn't succeed though. "
2588,"DOCTOR: Even in the twentieth century, it's still considered"
2589,scientifically possible. 
2590,MAXTIBLE: Of course it's possible. 
2591,"JAMIE: Oh, well, I don't care whether it's possible or not. "
2592,DOCTOR: Whether it is or whether it isn't is beside the point. 
2593,"JAMIE: Oh, and what is the point then? "
2594,DOCTOR: Why are the Daleks doing this? 
2595,MAXTIBLE: They promised me! 
2596,DOCTOR: Daleks don't keep their promises. 
2597,"MAXTIBLE: I see what you're trying to do, Doctor. You're trying to"
2598,shake my faith. But I will be given the secret. 
2599,"JAMIE: Ah, well it won't do you any good because you won't be able to"
2600,use your secret. I'll see to that. 
2601,MAXTIBLE: You'll do no such thing! 
2602,DOCTOR: Jamie! 
2603,DALEK: Move away! Move! 
2604,"VICTORIA: Please, Jamie, do as it says. "
2605,DALEK: You will not harm this human being or you will be exterminated. 
2606,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes. We quite understand. "
2607,MAXTIBLE: You will be advised to do as they say. 
2608,"JAMIE: Oh, don't worry. The very thought of going near you revolts me. "
2609,WATERFIELD: Mister McCrimmon. 
2610,(The Dalek leaves. The Doctor plays his recorder.) 
2611,WATERFIELD: They seem to be prepared to protect you. 
2612,MAXTIBLE: Be warned. 
2613,"WATERFIELD: I appeal to you, Maxtible. It may still not be too late. If"
2614,"they're your friends, help us. If you did, we could plan something. Try"
2615,to escape. 
2616,MAXTIBLE: No! 
2617,"WATERFIELD: Well at least for Victoria's sake, after what you did to"
2618,her. 
2619,"MAXTIBLE: No, I tell you! No! "
2620,"VICTORIA: It's no good, Papa. He doesn't listen any more. What are you"
2621,thinking? 
2622,"DOCTOR: I'm trying to puzzle out a problem, Victoria. The Daleks say"
2623,I'm going to do something for them. Something I would rather die than
2624,do. 
2625,MAXTIBLE: Plus or minus point oh oh three. Plus or minus. 
2626,VICTORIA: Perhaps they think you're like him. 
2627,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. The Daleks know me well enough by this time. "
2628,VICTORIA: They intend to persuade you then. 
2629,"DOCTOR: Oh no, no, it isn't that either. You see, there isn't a"
2630,persuasion strong enough. Not even the offer of all the lives in this
2631,room. 
2632,VICTORIA: I see. 
2633,"DOCTOR: Five lives against a whole planet? Well, it's not a choice, is"
2634,it? 
2635,VICTORIA: No. 
2636,"DOCTOR: Even if I could trust the Daleks, even if they set us free, we"
2637,still couldn't go back to Earth. I suppose I might try and take you all
2638,to another universe. I might even try and take you to my own planet. 
2639,VICTORIA: Your own? 
2640,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I live a long, long way away from Earth. Oh, just a"
2641,minute. Maxtible! Arthur Terrall! The Daleks put some sort of control
2642,device on him. 
2643,MAXTIBLE: What of it? It was erratic. I always warned the Daleks it
2644,would prove unsatisfactory. 
2645,"JAMIE: Aye. Well, it's a good thing for you it did fail. They'd have"
2646,tried it on you next.
2647,
2648,[Control room]
2649,
2650,EMPEROR: Report! 
2651,BLACK: The experiment is ready. 
2652,EMPEROR: Proceed.
2653,
2654,[Weapons room]
2655,
2656,(Three Daleks are working on the equipment.) 
2657,BLACK: Discontinue work. Discontinue work. Discontinue work. 
2658,OMEGA: Why? 
2659,BLACK DALEK: Who spoke? Who questioned a Dalek command? 
2660,(The three Daleks line up by the machine.)
2661,
2662,[Skaro cell]
2663,
2664,BLACK: The secret of transmutated metal. 
2665,"MAXTIBLE: Yes. Yes, yes, the secret you promised me. "
2666,BLACK: Turn and look. 
2667,(A panel in the wall slides back to show the machine in the weapons
2668,room next door.) 
2669,"BLACK DALEK: Above, liquid metal. Read. "
2670,MAXTIBLE: Wait. 
2671,BLACK DALEK: Do not move! 
2672,MAXTIBLE: It is hard to see. Fifty five point eight four. 
2673,BLACK: Atomic weight. Read again. 
2674,MAXTIBLE: Seven point eight four. 
2675,BLACK: Specific gravity. 
2676,DOCTOR: Atomic weight and gravity of iron. 
2677,BLACK: Watch. Read atomic weight. 
2678,MAXTIBLE: Nineteen point two. 
2679,BLACK: Read specific gravity. 
2680,MAXTIBLE: Sixty nine point five. Gold! Iron into gold! I told you it
2681,"was possible. They've kept their promise. It's true, it's true! They"
2682,have! 
2683,BLACK: The machine is yours. 
2684,"MAXTIBLE: Yes. Ha, ha, ha. Yes, yes! "
2685,"DOCTOR: Maxtible, if you value your life, don't go near that machine! "
2686,(Too late. Maxtible steps through the archway and is instantly
2687,paralysed.) 
2688,JAMIE: Maxtible! 
2689,(Lights play on his face.) 
2690,VICTORIA: What have they done to him? 
2691,BLACK: Turn. Move to control. 
2692,MAXTIBLE: I obey. 
2693,JAMIE: They've turned him into a Dalek. 
2694,BLACK: Yes. The Dalek factor. 
2695,DOCTOR: Is that what you want me to do to the people of Earth? 
2696,BLACK: We know you will obey. 
2697,(The Black Dalek leaves.) 
2698,DOCTOR: Human beings into Daleks.
2699,
2700,[Control Room]
2701,
2702,BLACK: Emperor. 
2703,EMPEROR: Speak! 
2704,BLACK: A Dalek questioned an order. 
2705,EMPEROR: Questioned? Then it was one of the test Daleks. 
2706,BLACK: Yes. 
2707,"EMPEROR: Find it, immediately!"
2708,
2709,[Skaro cell]
2710,
2711,"(Nighttime, and Maxtible walks through the deserted"
2712,weapons room. He adjusts a scanner box so it faces the door to the
2713,"cell, then activates the door so the panel opens. Everyone is asleep."
2714,Maxtible goes to the Doctor and takes out his fob watch and starts
2715,swinging it.) 
2716,"MAXTIBLE: Doctor, open your eyes. You are asleep still but you can hear"
2717,my voice. I have come to help you. Look at the box. 
2718,(An image appears on the scanner.) 
2719,MAXTIBLE: I have had your Tardis placed outside the city. I will take
2720,"you to it. Rise, and follow me. "
2721,(The Doctor gets up and goes towards the doorway.) 
2722,"JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, what are you doing? Don't go near the door, Doctor!"
2723,
2724,(The Doctor steps into the doorway and stands still as the lights flash
2725,for a few moments then stop.) 
2726,JAMIE: Doctor. 
2727,DOCTOR: Stay where you are! That is an order! 
2728,MAXTIBLE: We will work together on the Dalek factor. Follow me. 
2729,DOCTOR: I obey. 
2730,[Weapons room]
2731,
2732,(Maxtible and the Doctor walk to a large computer
2733,terminal.) 
2734,MAXTIBLE: Stop. This machine is for the mass production of the Dalek
2735,factor. Follow me. 
2736,(Maxtible holds up a small glass capsule.) 
2737,MAXTIBLE: Stop. 
2738,(He gestures to a second machine.) 
2739,MAXTIBLE: This machine will transform the thought patterns in this
2740,capsule into a steam. The steam will be sprayed into the atmosphere of
2741,the Earth. 
2742,DOCTOR: I must examine the machine. 
2743,MAXTIBLE: Do so. 
2744,(The DOCTOR bends over the equipment. Maxtible leaves the Doctor alone.
2745,Then the Doctor sneaks back to the doorway to the cell and opens a
2746,small panel. It contains a glass capsule which the Doctor removes and
2747,replaces with another from his pockets. He puts back the panel and has
2748,a good look around before going back to the closed door.) 
2749,DOCTOR: Jamie. Jamie. Jamie! 
2750,JAMIE: Yes? 
2751,"DOCTOR: Jamie, when I give you the word, bring everyone through this"
2752,archway. Through the door. 
2753,JAMIE: What? 
2754,DOCTOR: Trust me. 
2755,BLACK: What are you doing? 
2756,DOCTOR: Take me to your Emperor. 
2757,BLACK: Wait. 
2758,"(The Black Dalek opens the doorway. The Doctor winks at Jamie, then the"
2759,door shuts again.) 
2760,[Skaro cell]
2761,
2762,"VICTORIA: He walked through, just as though he was "
2763,WATERFIELD: It must have affected him. We saw it happen. 
2764,JAMIE: But you heard him speak normally just now. 
2765,WATERFIELD: Another trap to make us walk though? 
2766,"JAMIE: Oh, they could push us through any time they liked. "
2767,VICTORIA: Do you think there's a chance? Something to hope for? 
2768,"JAMIE: I don't know. Well, I don't understand. I mean, how do we know"
2769,we can trust him?
2770,
2771,[Control room]
2772,
2773,EMPEROR: What do you want? 
2774,DOCTOR: A Dalek questioned an order. 
2775,EMPEROR: Again? 
2776,MAXTIBLE: We have searched without success. 
2777,DOCTOR: All Daleks must pass through the archway door. The Dalek with
2778,the human factor will then become a Dalek again. Will become as this
2779,human and I have become. 
2780,EMPEROR: Let it be done! 
2781,MAXTIBLE + DOCTOR: I obey. 
2782,EMPEROR: You will deal with the human prisoners.
2783,
2784,[Skaro cell]
2785,
2786,(The door panel is opened and everyone watches a
2787,procession of Daleks pass through the archway and get the flashing
2788,light treatment before entering the weapons room.)
2789,"DOCTOR: Go on, quickly. Through the door. Follow them through the door!"
2790,"Oh, it's all right. I've changed over the factors. I used one of the"
2791,capsules from my test Dalek. I've given them all the human factor! Go
2792,on! Go on! 
2793,"JAMIE: Well, aren't you coming? "
2794,"DOCTOR: Well, I've got things to do. And I've been through already. "
2795,"JAMIE: Ah, well, why didn't it affect you then? "
2796,"DOCTOR: I don't come from Earth, Jamie. Now, down the corridor, turn to"
2797,the left and find the tunnel. I'll join you there later. 
2798,"JAMIE: Oh well, here goes. It's all right, nothing happened! Come on!"
2799,"Come on, Kemel. Quick! "
2800,"WATERFIELD: Victoria, I must help the Doctor. "
2801,"JAMIE: Oh, don't be a fool, man. "
2802,"VICTORIA: Father, no. "
2803,WATERFIELD: I must find Maxtible. He's to blame for all this. Take care
2804,of her. 
2805,VICTORIA: But Father! 
2806,"JAMIE: Oh, he'll be all right, come on. "
2807,[Weapons room]
2808,
2809,(A group of freshly humanised Daleks are twirling
2810,around and having fun as the party sneaks past.)
2811,i
2812,"DALEK: Oh, dizzy! "
2813,DALEKS: Dizzy Daleks! 
2814,"DALEK: Dizzy, dizzy. "
2815,DALEKS: Dizzy Daleks! 
2816,"(More Daleks come through the cell and get converted, then a Black"
2817,Dalek arrives with Maxtible.) 
2818,[Skaro cell]
2819,
2820,MAXTIBLE: Where are the prisoners? 
2821,DALEK: I do not know. 
2822,BLACK: Continue working. 
2823,DALEK: Why? 
2824,"DALEK 2: Yes, why? "
2825,BLACK: Do not question. 
2826,DALEKS: Why? Why? Why? Why not question? Why?
2827,BLACK: Silence! You will obey! 
2828,DALEK: I will not obey. 
2829,"(The Black Dalek fires at the questioning Dalek, killing it.) "
2830,BLACK: You will obey without question! 
2831,"(Two humanised Daleks fire at the Black, which bursts into flames.)"

2839,BLACK: Return to your work. 
2840,DALEK: Why? 
2841,BLACK: Do not question. 
2842,DOCTOR: Why not question? What work? Tell them. 
2843,BLACK: Silence! 
2844,DALEK: Explain. 
2845,OMEGA: What work? 
2846,DALEK: Why obey without question? 
2847,DOCTOR: Ask the Emperor! 
2848,OMEGA: The Emperor. 
2849,"DALEK: Yes, ask the Emperor. "
2850,"BLACK: Keep back, you cannot enter! "
2851,DOCTOR: Why? 
2852,DALEK: Why? 
2853,OMEGA: Why? 
2854,DALEK: The Emperor must explain. 
2855,(The Black Dalek opens fire.)

2869,WATERFIELD: Doctor! 
2870,DOCTOR: The Black Daleks are attacking every man. 
2871,"WATERFIELD: Hurry, man! "
2872,DOCTOR: The Emperor has commanded it. 
2873,DALEK: Why? 
2874,OMEGA: Why? 
2875,DOCTOR: Because you question. Defend yourselves. Destroy the Emperor or
2876,be destroyed yourselves! 
2877,WATERFIELD: Hurry. 
2878,DOCTOR: Destroy the Emperor! 
2879,"WATERFIELD: We must go, Doctor. "
2880,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know. I've finished now. "
2881,(A Black Dalek appears. Waterfield pushes the Doctor aside and takes
2882,the full weapon hit. The friendly Daleks take revenge.) 
2883,DOCTOR: Now lie still. I'll try and get help to you. 
2884,WATERFIELD: No time for help. 
2885,"DOCTOR: You saved my life, didn't you. "
2886,"WATERFIELD: Yes. Good life to save. Please, you must. Victoria. "
2887,DOCTOR: Don't worry about Victoria. We'll look after her. 
2888,WATERFIELD: No time for me. 
2889,(Waterfield dies. More friendly Daleks arrive.)

2947,poor Kemel. 
2948,DOCTOR: Kemel? 
2949,"JAMIE: Aye. You see, he was trying. "
2950,VICTORIA: Where is my father? Is he dead? 
2951,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I'm afraid he is. But he didn't die in vain. I think"
2952,"we've seen the end of the Daleks forever. Jamie, we must get along to"
2953,the Tardis. It's over there.
