21,[Tardis]
22,
23,JAMIE: We can't just leave her. 
24,"DOCTOR: We're not leaving her, Jamie. It was her decision to stay."
25,She'll be perfectly all right with the Harrises. Now don't worry so
26,much. 
27,"JAMIE: I'm not, I'm just. Och, come on, let's go. "
28,"DOCTOR: Well, where would you like to go? "
29,JAMIE: I couldn't care less. 
30,"DOCTOR: I was fond of her too, you know, Jamie."
31,(The Tardis dematerialises and Victoria's image fades from the screen.
32,"Later in the flight, Jamie is dozing in a chair.) "
33,"DOCTOR: Jamie, we're landing. Jamie! "
34,JAMIE: Huh? 
35,DOCTOR: We're landing! 
36,JAMIE: Oh. 
37,"DOCTOR: Let's have a look at the scanner, shall we? "
38,(The scanner screen is blank.) 
39,JAMIE: I thought you said we'd landed? 
40,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, we are, but I seem to have lost the picture. Let's try"
41,"a little bit more power, shall we? "
42,JAMIE: Are you sure you're pushing the right one? 
43,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course I am. Look at the fault indicator, will you?"
44,It's round there on the left. 
45,"JAMIE: No, it's all right here. "
46,DOCTOR: No movement at all? 
47,JAMIE: No. 
48,"DOCTOR: Well, that's funny. The air's all right, the temperature's"
49,perfectly normal. There seems to be rather a lot of metal all around us
50,
51,"JAMIE: What? Oh, you know I can't hear you when you talk to yourself. "
52,"DOCTOR: There we are, it's coming up now. "
53,(A beautiful lake appears on the scanner.) 
54,"JAMIE: Hey, now that looks all right! Boy! Look at it. Hey, what's"
55,that? 
56,(It's an exotic animal.) 
57,JAMIE: The size of it. 
58,"DOCTOR: Well, that's funny, it's changed to night now. "
59,"JAMIE: It's a wee bit quick, isn't it? Look, it's changed again. What's"
60,going on? 
61,"DOCTOR: Oh dear. Those pictures aren't what's happening outside, I'm"
62,certain of that. 
63,JAMIE: Why do they keep appearing then? 
64,DOCTOR: They're temptations. 
65,JAMIE: Eh? 
66,DOCTOR: The Tardis is trying to warn us to get away from here to
67,somewhere more pleasant. I must have pushed the wrong switch. 
68,JAMIE: The red light's stopped flashing. 
69,DOCTOR: What? 
70,JAMIE: Something must be wrong. 
71,DOCTOR: What? Well the power's overloading. The power lines are
72,overloading!
73,(There's a flash.) 
74,DOCTOR: The fluid link's gone! 
75,"JAMIE: Doctor, look under here. "
76,(A toxic gas is coming from the base of the console.) 
77,"DOCTOR: The mercury's vapourising! We've got to get out of here, come"
78,on. 
79,JAMIE: But how? 
80,(The Doctor opens a small hatch beside the main doors to reveal a
81,golden rod with capped ends attached to a bracket.) 
82,DOCTOR: Hold on to me. 
83,JAMIE: What are you going to do? 
84,DOCTOR: Just hold on! 
85,(The Doctor grasps the rod and pulls it from its holder. The console
86,room walls shimmer and fold in on themselves. The doors are now open
87,and the Doctor and Jamie get out.)
88,
89,[Rocket motor section]
90,
91,(A cramped compartment.) 
92,"JAMIE: Doctor, what's happened to the Tardis? "
93,DOCTOR: I disengaged the time vector generator. 
94,JAMIE: The what? 
95,"DOCTOR: Well once removed, it alters the size of the Tardis. The inside"
96,"becomes an ordinary telephone box again. Come along, come and sit over"
97,here. 
98,"(The Doctor still has the rod, and Jamie is coughing a lot.) "
99,"DOCTOR: If I hadn't have done, the mercury vapour would have killed us."
100,
101,JAMIE: Where are we? 
102,DOCTOR: It looks like the motor section of some sort of rocket. 
103,JAMIE: A rocket? 
104,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. There's an artificial gravity system, too. "
105,JAMIE: What does that do? 
106,"DOCTOR: Well, it's what keeps us on our feet, otherwise we'd be"
107,floating around. 
108,"JAMIE: Oh. There's no water around, is there? "
109,"DOCTOR: Water, no. Not in here, Jamie. There's no movement either, is"
110,there. 
111,"JAMIE: We're on the ground, then. "
112,"DOCTOR: Yes, I expect so. Ouch! "
113,"JAMIE: What's the matter? Well, don't keep me in suspense, what's"
114,happened? 
115,(The Doctor pulls out a paper bag out of his pocket.) 
116,DOCTOR: Have a lemon sherbet. It'll quench your thirst. 
117,(The Doctor goes to examine the door of the compartment.) 
118,"JAMIE: Doctor, the warning mechanism obviously thought there was"
119,"something wrong out here, but what? I mean, everything's so, well,"
120,"dead, isn't it? "
121,DOCTOR: Jamie. 
122,JAMIE: What? 
123,DOCTOR: Look. It's a track. 
124,(There are marks on the floor leading under the door.) 
125,"DOCTOR: Why, that's oil. It must be some sort of machine. It's recent,"
126,too. 
127,"JAMIE: Well, I wonder what that would"
128,(Jamie presses a button and the door opens.) 
129,JAMIE: I just. Oh.
130,
131, [Corridor]
132,
133,(It is an empty corridor. They follow the track
134,past two other doorways before reaching a blank metal shutter at the
135,far end. There are controls and a monitor screen in the wall nearby.) 
136,JAMIE: Shall we open the door? 
137,"DOCTOR: No. No, there may be something on the other side. Here. "
138,(The Doctor looks at the monitor controls and flicks a switch.) 
139,DOCTOR: Here we are. 
140,(The image of a shadow-filled control room appears on the screen. It is
141,"filled with banks of computers and control panels, but there are no"
142,"people visible. There is a small coffin-shaped pod next to an airlock,"
143,with a large metal crate on the other side.) 
144,JAMIE: Looks safe enough. 
145,DOCTOR: Yes. What caused the defence mechanism of the Tardis to
146,register danger then? And where's the crew? And what's this track?
147,There's plenty of air in there. Let's try and get in. 
148,(The door won't open.) 
149,JAMIE: Oh. I'll look up here then. 
150,(Jamie goes back to the first of the two doors and opens it. There's
151,nothing interesting inside so he closes it and goes to the other one.) 
152,JAMIE: Stores in that one. 
153,DOCTOR: It's living quarters here. 
154,[Rocket living quarters]
155,
156,(The door closes behind them. There is a bunk bed
157,"and a dispensing machine, table and two chairs.) "
158,JAMIE: Ah. Water! 
159,"(Meanwhile, in the control room, a squat, squared-off robot comes out"
160,"of the shadow. It has two short stubby arms and protruding antennae,"
161,and illuminated detectors instead of a face. It communicates
162,electronically with the rocket's systems. The door opens and the robot
163,looks out. It sees nothing and the door closes again.) 
164,JAMIE: I'd have thought a rocket this size would have carried more than
165,two people. 
166,"DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, it does. It carries four. Two on duty and two"
167,resting. 
168,"JAMIE: Oh, the Tardis must have gone mad, then. I mean, there's nothing"
169,"on board here, so there's no danger. "
170,DOCTOR: Isn't there? 
171,(The Doctor looks through a porthole.) 
172,"DOCTOR: We're just drifting, Jamie. Drifting aimlessly in space."
173,Perhaps that's what the Tardis was trying to warn us about. 
174,JAMIE: What's it matter? 
175,"DOCTOR: Matter? We're just a piece of space flotsam, don't you realise"
176,that? 
177,"JAMIE: Well all right, stick your rod dimen "
178,DOCTOR: Time vector generator. 
179,"JAMIE: Aye, stick it back in, and we'll float off somewhere else. "
180,"DOCTOR: No, it's not as simple as that, Jamie. The fluid, hmm? We need"
181,"mercury to refill it, don't we. "
182,"JAMIE: Well there must be some on board here, surely? "
183,"DOCTOR: Yes, I hope so. "
184,JAMIE: Well there's got to be. 
185,DOCTOR: What's happened to the crew? They haven't just gone out for a
186,"little constitutional, you know. "
187,"JAMIE: Well, we won't find that out till we look inside that control"
188,"room, will we? "
189,"(In the control room, a three-handed clock is running. The numeric"
190,"display above reads 10,025 and falling.)"
191,
192,[Rocket motor section]
193,
194,(The Doctor and Jamie have searched the ship.) 
195,"DOCTOR: Well, I've searched my side. There's not a drop of mercury"
196,anywhere. 
197,"JAMIE: Me, too. No, the only place we haven't searched is that control"
198,room. 
199,"DOCTOR: Well, we'll have a breather, and then we'll try in there. "
200,JAMIE: And perhaps we'll find some food in that machine as well. 
201,DOCTOR: I can give you another lemon drop. 
202,"JAMIE: Something a bit more substantial, please. "
203,DOCTOR: What do you fancy? 
204,JAMIE: Well right now I'd like a nice plate of roast beef with all the
205,trimmings. 
206,DOCTOR: I'll see what I can do. 
207,"JAMIE: Eh? Ah now Doctor, where are you going to find a plate of roast"
208,beef on this place? 
209,[Rocket living quarters]
210,
211,(The Doctor works the dispensing machine controls.)
212,
213,JAMIE: What are you doing? 
214,"DOCTOR: Roast beef, you said? "
215,"JAMIE: Well, yes. "
216,DOCTOR: What vegetables? 
217,JAMIE: Potatoes 
218,DOCTOR: Potatoes. 
219,JAMIE: And cabbage. 
220,DOCTOR: And cabbage. What about a drop of fruit salad? 
221,"JAMIE: Fruit salad, yes. "
222,"DOCTOR: And I'll have some pork, potatoes and carrots. And, I'll have a"
223,drop of ice-cream. 
224,"(Two paper plates appear, with white cubes on them.) "
225,DOCTOR: There we are. what about the gravy? 
226,JAMIE: I don't think so. 
227,DOCTOR: Gravy. 
228,JAMIE: Am I supposed to eat this? 
229,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. It'll be delicious. "
230,"JAMIE: I've heard of a square meal, but this is ridiculous. "
231,DOCTOR: Sit down and eat up. 
232,"JAMIE: Doctor, what do you think Victoria's doing now? "
233,"DOCTOR: Now? Time is relative, Jamie. If I knew when 'now' was, I might"
234,be able to hazard a guess. 
235,JAMIE: You know what I mean. 
236,"DOCTOR: Well, she's decided to stay in a good historical period. Very"
237,"few wars, great prosperity. She'll be happy enough. This is very"
238,"filling, isn't it? "
239,"JAMIE: Aye. Well, what do we do now? "
240,"DOCTOR: Well, when we've digested our dinner we'll have another try to"
241,get into the control room. 
242,"JAMIE: Oh well, while you do that, I'm going to have a wee lie down. "
243,(Jamie stretches out on the bunk.) 
244,"JAMIE: Tell me, though. What do you think happened to the crew? "
245,"DOCTOR: I don't know, Jamie. I wish I did. I suppose they've been"
246,overtaken by some disaster or other. Perhaps we'll find out when we get
247,into the control room.
248,(The control room door opens and the little robot comes out and goes to
249,"the open door of the motor section. It is quite slow, and is constantly"
250,taking readings of its surroundings. The Doctor is using his pocket
251,telescope to look out of the porthole.) 
252,"DOCTOR: Well, at least we don't seem to be in any immediate danger,"
253,Jamie. But I would like to know 
254,(Jamie is fast asleep.) 
255,"(The servo-robot has reached the Tardis. In the control room, the"
256,"countdown reads 1,000. A light flashes on the robot's casing. It goes"
257,"into the corridor and laser-welds the motor section door shut, then"
258,"returns to the control room. After listening at the cabin door, the"
259,Doctor opens it and looks into the corridor. He sees a fresh set of
260,oily tracks on the floor and follows them to the control room door.
261,"There he turns on the wall monitor, but it is full of static. Inside,"
262,the robot connects itself to a computer bank and the rocket begins to
263,turn. The Doctor is thrown against a wall by the movement. Jamie is
264,"tipped from the bunk, and goes to find the Doctor.)"
265,
266, [Corridor]
267,
268,"JAMIE: Doctor, what's happening? "
269,DOCTOR: I hit my head. Oh! 
270,JAMIE: We're moving. The rocket's moving. 
271,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know. There's someone in the control room. "
272,JAMIE: Let's have a look. 
273,"DOCTOR: No, no, Jamie. We've got to get back to the Tardis. It's the"
274,only safe place. 
275,"JAMIE: Doctor, the mercury stuff. "
276,DOCTOR: Never mind that. 
277,(Jamie helps the groggy Doctor stand up and go to the motor section
278,door.) 
279,"JAMIE: It won't open. Doctor, someone's sealed the door. "
280,(The Doctor collapses. Jamie helps him up and into the cabin.) 
281,[Rocket living quarters]
282,
283,"DOCTOR: Lock it, Jamie. Lock it. "
284,"JAMIE: Easy. Doctor, are you all right? Doctor? "
285,(The Doctor has collapses onto the bunk.) 
286,"(In the control room, the robot disconnects from the computer and goes"
287,to the pod by the airlock. They exchange electronic signals then the
288,pod opens to reveal a row of small white spheres. The inner and outer
289,airlock doors open and the room depressurises. The countdown has
290,reached Zero. The spheres float out through the airlock into space. The
291,"airlock closes and the robot repressurises the control room, then goes"
292,to a large monitor screen which now shows a large space station. Its
293,"top section is flattened, like a large wheel, with a complicated"
294,lattice of rocket motors and antennae below. The robot reconnects to
295,the computer and the rocket stops.)
296,"JAMIE: Doctor, there's a great big silver thing out here. "
297,DOCTOR: Into the Tardis. I've got to get him to safety. 
298,(Jamie is looking out of the porthole as the Doctor crawls into the
299,"corridor, takes a cap off one end of the time vector generator and"
300,points it at the sealed motor section door. A beam vapourises the seal.
301,"When he has finished, the Doctor puts the cap back on the TVG and puts"
302,"the device in his pocket. Before he can open the door, he is aware of"
303,the robot right behind him.) 
304,"JAMIE: Doctor, you must see this. "
305, [Corridor]
306,
307,(Jamie looks out of the cabin to see the robot. He
308,grabs the metallic blanket from the bunk and throws it over the
309,"machine, which skitters away, blind.) "
310,"JAMIE: Back to the cabin, quick!"
311,
312,[Rocket living quarters]
313,
314,JAMIE: Easy. Easy now. 
315,"(Outside, the robot blows the blanket off with a jet of air and heads"
316,for the cabin.) 
317,"DOCTOR: Jamie, take this. It's a gun. Like a torch. You have to be"
318,careful. 
319,(He gives Jamie the TVG as the robot's laser begins to burn through the
320,"cabin door. Carefully, Jamie unscrews the tip of the rod and aims it at"
321,"the door. The beam hits the robot, sending it flying down to the door"
322,of the motor section where it explodes.) 
323,"JAMIE: Oh. We're all right for the time being. But listen, you. Mo more"
324,"gallivanting about till I say so, all right? Doctor? Doctor? "
325,(The Doctor is unconscious.)
326,
327, [Wheel Operations room]
328,
329,(Everyone is gathered around a man at a radio
330,"control console. He is Leo Ryan, Communications Officer.) "
331,RYAN: (Australian) Hold. Get a fix on that. 
332,CORWYN: It's not moving now. 
333,"(Gemma Corwyn, Medical Officer.) "
334,LERNOV: Crossover zero. 
335,"(Tanya Lernov, Russian.) "
336,"RYAN: Triangulate it, Rico. How's it now. Tanya? "
337,CORWYN: The same. 
338,LERNOV: Just a slight drift. 
339,"RYAN: No, no the movement isn't real, it's just an illusion caused by"
340,slight polar precession. 
341,"(An older man, Commander Jarvis Bennett, enters.) "
342,BENNETT: How's our mystery rocket? 
343,CORWYN: Suddenly lifeless. 
344,"RYAN: Doesn't make sense, sir. It must have been driven by something. "
345,CORWYN: No radio contact. 
346,BENNETT: I'm not surprised. I've just checked out its description on
347,the register. It's a Phoenix Mark Four named Silver Carrier. 
348,RYAN: Tanya? 
349,LERNOV: The register's even. No crossover reading now. 
350,"RYAN: No, it's definitely stopped moving. "
351,CORWYN: Silver Carrier? 
352,BENNETT: Supply ship for Station Five. Reported overdue nine weeks ago.
353,It's only about eighty or ninety million miles off course. 
354,"RYAN: Try radio contact again, Rico. "
355,CASALI: Okay. 
356,(Enrico Casali.) 
357,CASALI: Station Three to Silver Carrier. Station Three to Silver
358,"Carrier. Call sign LX88J. Repeat, LX88J. Come in, please. Nothing. "
359,"CORWYN: It couldn't have drifted all that way, Jarvis. "
360,"BENNETT: No, it couldn't. "
361,"LERNOV: Try the emergency again, Leo? "
362,RYAN: Station Three to Silver Carrier. Pull switch with red band to
363,operate emergency transmitter. 
364,CORWYN: You think their radio's gone? 
365,LERNOV: In case. 
366,"BENNETT: Good procedure. I'm afraid we're wasting our time, but waste"
367,it we must. 
368,"RYAN: Any reaction, Tanya? "
369,"LERNOV: No, nothing. No movement at all. "
370,CORWYN: How does Silver Carrier turn up in this part of the cosmos? 
371,BENNETT: Something happens to the crew. One of them puts on the
372,"automatic. The rocket's travelled so far now, the power feedback to"
373,automatic is probably failing. 
374,"RYAN: Yes, that's possible. "
375,BENNETT: It could start up and start moving again at any minute. 
376,CORWYN: And the crew? 
377,BENNETT: A dozen and one things. 
378,"RYAN: Well, we've tried everything, sir. We can't raise a sound. "
379,"BENNETT: Trouble is, if I'm right about that automatic, and I think I"
380,"am, that rocket could suddenly accelerate and whip straight towards us."
381,"There can't be any life on board there, can there?) "
382,(Meanwhile the spheres drift further from the rocket and straight for
383,the Wheel.) 
384,LERNOV: I'm getting something. Like small meteorites hitting our outer
385,rim. 
386,(The spheres are landing on the Wheel and being absorbed into the
387,hull.) 
388,LERNOV: There's another drop in air pressure. 
389,"CORWYN: It can't be meteorites, we'd have had some warning. "
390,"LERNOV: Well, something. Look. Jumping all over the place. "
391,BENNETT: It's obvious. We must take it some minor objects have escaped
392,from the Silver Carrier. Objects of small mass and high density. 
393,"CORWYN: Then these objects would be clinging close to the rocket,"
394,"Jarvis, not descending on us. "
395,"BENNETT: It doesn't matter, Gemma, it really doesn't. Don't start"
396,looking for mysteries. Now I can't risk that rocket homing on this
397,station. 
398,CORWYN: What are you going to do? 
399,"BENNETT: In a few moments, you're going to experience a sight rarely"
400,"seen by human beings. Leo, is that projector on standby? "
401,"RYAN: Yes, sir. Moving into position now. "
402,"CORWYN: Jarvis, what are you going to do? "
403,BENNETT: Turn the X-ray laser on the Silver Carrier. In a few moments
404,you're going to witness the complete destruction of a rocket in space. 
405,
406, Episode Two
407,
408, [Wheel Operations room]
409,
410,"CASALI: On Red band emergency frequency, come in,"
411,"please. Come in, please. Station Three to Silver Carrier, Station Three"
412,"to Silver Carrier. On Red band emergency frequency, come in please. "
413,"BENNETT: All ready, Leo? "
414,"RYAN: Yes, sir. It's locked on now. "
415,"BENNETT: That's it. Don't get much fun, do we? Better make the most of"
416,it. 
417,"RYAN: Make a change from blasting meteorites, wouldn't it? "
418,CORWYN: Jarvis? 
419,"BENNETT: Hold it a minute. Tanya, can we take a visual recording of it?"
420,
421,"LERNOV: Yes sir, can do. "
422,"RYAN: Still no movement or radio ,signals sir. "
423,"BENNETT: Put up the anti-magnetic shield, Leo, when I give the word. "
424,RYAN: Right. 
425,"CASALI: Still going to plan, sir. "
426,"BENNETT: Good, I'll do an announcement about reverberations. "
427,"CORWYN: Before you do that, Jarvis, can I have a word? It's important. "
428,CASALI: More bogeys. 
429,(Corwyn and Bennett move away.) 
430,RYAN: All systems on green. Stand by. 
431,ALL: Green. Stand by. 
432,LERNOV: I don't know what you grinning about. 
433,RYAN: Neither do I. 
434,"LERNOV: It isn't funny, Leo. The Controller's like a kid with a new"
435,toy. 
436,"RYAN: Oh, don't tell me you're going to be a old stick in the mud, too?"
437,
438,"LERNOV: If you are referring to Doctor Corwyn, she is known. She is no"
439,stick in the mud. She's perfectly right to be cautious. 
440,"RYAN: Come on, Tanya. It's off course about eighty million miles. I"
441,"mean, there can't possibly be anyone alive on the thing. "
442,"(On the Silver Carrier, Jamie is trying to shine a signal light out of"
443,"the cabin porthole. He pulls the light to far and the cable comes out,"
444,putting the room into darkness. He sees a small glow by the Doctor. It
445,is the Time Vector Generator. Jamie holds it up to the porthole.)
446,
447,[Corwyn's office]
448,
449,"CORWYN: Yes, I know all that, Jarvis, but we still"
450,can't be absolutely certain. 
451,"BENNETT: Gemma, one thing that I beg of you. Don't subject me to"
452,"psychoanalysis. You think I'm having a whale of a time, don't you? All"
453,"kids again. Bang, bang, blow up the balloon. You're wrong, you know. "
454,CORWYN: Am I? 
455,"BENNETT: Say what you like, the Silver Carrier is a menace to the"
456,Wheel. Now surely you can see that? 
457,"CORWYN: If you equate menace with automatic power drive, I don't. "
458,BENNETT: What else? 
459,CORWYN: You want me to believe some emergency happened on the Silver
460,Carrier. The pilot switched to automatic and then tragedy. 
461,BENNETT: Right. 
462,CORWYN: And all the crew died? 
463,BENNETT: Right again. 
464,"CORWYN: Where was the Carrier bound for, Jarvis? "
465,BENNETT: Servicing Station Five. I told you. 
466,CORWYN: Then isn't it be reasonable to assume that the automatic would
467,have taken it to Station Five? 
468,"BENNETT: Yes, that's good reasoning. But you're forgetting the"
469,"emergency. That could have damaged the control sensors. In fact, it"
470,"must have done, which is why the rocket is so far off course. "
471,"CORWYN: Assumption again, guesswork. It would be so easy to check. "
472,BENNETT: We can't risk that rocket turning in on us. Don't you see?
473,It'd blast a hole right through us!

481,RUDKIN: Noise! Fantastic noise through my headphones. 
482,LERNOV: Leo! The approach indicators are all at red! 
483,"RYAN: What's causing it? Green system's gone crazy. Tanya, get Doctor"

497,is mine! This station and the people on it are my responsibility. 
498,LERNOV: Rudkin's hurt! 
499,CORWYN: What happened? 
500,LERNOV: Colossal static pulses swamping the detectors. 
501,BENNETT: It's the rocket. I knew it was a menace.

506,"BENNETT: All right, Tanya, get back to the complex. See if you can pin"
507,this static down. 
508,"BENNETT: Vallance, Casali, here. Well? "
509,CORWYN: It's bad. 
510,BENNETT: Can we move him? 
511,CORWYN: Yes. 
512,"BENNETT: Right. You two, take him to the Medical Bay. "
513,"CORWYN: Gently with him, now. "
514,(Rudkin is carried out.) 
515,"BENNETT: Your attention. That rocket has given us enough trouble. Bill,"
516,knock it out. 
517,"DUGGAN: Right, sir. "
518,LERNOV: Controller! 
519,"BENNETT: Yes, what is it? "
520,LERNOV: The static. There's a signal on it. 
521,BENNETT: There can't be. 
522,"RYAN: You're right, Tanya. Get me a fix on that. "
523,LERNOV: If I can. It's not any code that I've ever heard before but
524,there's definitely a repetitive order to it. 
525,RYAN: It's no good using radio or radar. We will have to use
526,millimicron waves. 
527,BENNETT: You think it's coming from the rocket? 
528,RYAN: Just want to make sure that it's not coming from anywhere else. 
529,LERNOV: The rocket. It is! 
530,BENNETT: You're sure? 
531,LERNOV: Certain. I was fixed on it anyway. There's no doubt. 
532,BENNETT: Then somebody is on board. Phil! 
533,PHIL: Sir. 
534,"BENNETT: I want two men to cross over. Organise it, will you? "
535,PHIL: Right sir. 
536,BENNETT: Eighty million miles off course. If they're alive on board
537,"that craft, they must be in a pretty bad way."

544,looking in. The newcomer gestures towards the front of the rocket.
545,Jamie goes to the control room but the door is locked. Two men have
546,already entered through the airlock. They repressurise the control room

566,RYAN: What's the story? 
567,"LERNOV: I don't know. Quite a mystery, isn't it. "
568,"RYAN: Jarvis won't like that. What that on green system three, Chang? "
569,"CHANG: (Oriental) Very odd, sir. Been getting one or two funny signs"
570,here and there all the time. Soon as you check them out they vanish. 
571,"RYAN: Put them in the log, okay? "
572,"CHANG: Yes, sir. It as if a number of magnets were touching the outer"

581,"RYAN: Something else worrying you, Tanya? "
582,LERNOV: What about those sudden drops in air pressure levels? They were
583,small enough and soon adjust themselves but I didn't like it. 
584,RYAN: How small? 
585,"LERNOV: Only a few millimetres. One degree, sometimes one and a half. "
586,"RYAN: Hmm. Some fault in the air supply unit, or the pumps. "
587,LERNOV: In so many different parts of the Wheel? 
588,RYAN: Did you tell Jarvis? 
589,LERNOV: Of course. He bit my head off. 
590,RYAN: And have you told Gemma Corwyn yet? 
591,"LERNOV: No, she was busy with the new arrivals. I didn't like to"
592,disturb her.

620,CORWYN: Fancy dress or something? Your clothes.

623,as well. 
624,CORWYN: I dare say. But I don't understand the analogy. We're both in

646,"JAMIE: Well, I was ill in the cabin, you see. A terrible fever. Raving"
647,"for days. Well, when I came to, the door was closed against us, the"
648,Doctor was hurt and your people came. 
649,CORWYN: All the communicating doors were closed against you?

683,"CORWYN: No reference, thank you, Zoe. I need your help in another way. "
684,ZOE : Oh? 
685,CORWYN: One of the people retrieved from the rogue spaceship is coming
686,to your section. I'd like you to show him over the Wheel and observe

715,you of Scandinavian origin? Danish?

732,"DUGGAN: No, they're floating seeds. The only place they flourish is"
733,"down here in the power room. Of course, the old man kicked up a mad"
734,"dust storm at first, but Doc Corwyn said it was good psychology or"
735,"something. Anyway, I just like flowers. Hey, that one comes all the way"

739,DUGGAN: And this is the capacitator bank for the x-ray lasers. 
740,JAMIE: The what? 
741,"DUGGAN: Oh, it controls the laser gun. Without it the gun's useless. "
742,JAMIE: What do you need a gun for up in space anyway?

744,miles in any one direction. Good eh?

766,CORWYN: What panics? 
767,"BENNETT: Oh, nothing, nothing. I'll tell you if it gets serious. People"
768,"are just edgy. Out in space, human beings have got to rely on routines,"

779,"very fit both mentally and physically, nice constructive personality."
780,His blood pressure suggests he's not been in space very long. 
781,BENNETT: Lies about what? 
782,CORWYN: He said he had fever aboard the Silver Carrier. He hadn't. His
783,gamma globulins are normal. 
784,BENNETT: Oh? Why should he lie about that? 
785,CORWYN: I asked him what happened to the crew. Fever was his excuse for
786,"not knowing. And then again he lied. At least, I almost sure he lied"
787,"about his friend's name. John Smith, he called him. "
788,"BENNETT: Well, they do exist, you know. "
789,"CORWYN: Yes, he was looking at that for long enough. Coincidence"
790,"possibly. Somehow I doubt it. And then, what's the most precious thing"
791,"in deep space, Jarvis? "
792,"BENNETT: Air, water, take your pick. "
793,CORWYN: Exactly. In space training even for one journey travellers. He
794,asked me for a drink of water and then he left it. He might have been
795,"on Earth. That boy's has no space travel training, Jarvis. He's"
796,"probably a stowaway, or he may be an agent. "
797,BENNETT: Sabotage? 
798,CORWYN: Plenty of people on Earth think we should suspend the space
799,programme. Some of them have forced their opinions already. 
800,"BENNETT: Do you think these two could have stowed away somehow, even"
801,"disposed of the crew of the Silver Carrier, pretended to drift here"
802,"helplessly, we take them in and they start breaking things up? "
803,CORWYN: I don't go that far. 
804,"BENNETT: Well of course, it's fits! Everything fits! "
805,"CORWYN: I only suggested it as a possibility, Jarvis. There are others."

833,LERNOV: Has Jarvis given the go-ahead? 
834,"RYAN: Yes, I've run a new co-ordinate fix. Everything's programmed and"
835,ready. All we need now is the final signal. 
836,"JAMIE: Oh, you're not going to blow up the rocket, then? "
837,"RYAN: Well, it might hit us, so to be on the safe side we blast it out"
838,of existence. 
839,LERNOV: Jarvis asked me to make a visual recording of it. I'd better
840,"re-position. Zoe, help me do a quick mental calculation, would you?"
841,You're quicker than me. 
842,RYAN: It'll be great to see this at leisure. It should be quite an

1153,about temporary lapses in memory. There is quite a lot we don't know

1185,tell me there's something you can't work out. 
1186,"ZOE: How did you pilot the rocket ship? You see, I've calculated its"
1187,original course. It was a service and supply station for number five
1188,"station, overdue and presumed lost nine weeks ago. Well, the rocket"
1189,couldn't drift eighty seven million miles off course. 
1190,DOCTOR: So what's your theory? 
1191,"ZOE: Well, there's a record of the last contract with the Silver"
1192,Carrier rocket. It had seven million miles to touchdown and enough fuel
1193,"for twenty million. Well, it couldn't have drifted here off course in"
1194,the time involved. It must have been driven and piloted. 
1195,"JAMIE: Oh, a right wee space detective. "
1196,ZOE: There's only one solution. That rocket was re-fuelled in space.
1197,Provided with at least with another twelve fuel rods. 
1198,"DOCTOR: Well, it's an interesting theory. "
1199,"ZOE: Oh, it isn't a theory. You can't disprove the facts. It's pure"
1200,logic. 
1201,"DOCTOR: Logic, my dear Zoe, merely enables one to be wrong with"
1202,authority. Supposing there was a faulty automatic pilot. 
1203,ZOE: To drive a rocket eighty seven million miles on fuel for twenty
1204,million? 
1205,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a possibility. "

1307,"DOCTOR: It's a possibility, isn't it. Jamie, what do you think? "
1308,"JAMIE: Me? Well, there can be a saboteur on board. Jarvis Bennett, de"
1309,"did say something about a group of people. Earth For Earth, something"
1310,like that. 
1311,"ZOE: Well, there are such people. They do want to stop the space"

1313,"JAMIE: Aye, well, just supposing they planted a saboteur on board,"
1314,waiting for the right moment. Along drifts the rocket and we're abroad.
1315,The saboteur thinks this is the right moment and strikes. 
1316,DOCTOR: And murders? 
1317,"JAMIE: Well, if he was caught messing about with the Bernalium stuff,"
1318,he may had to kill. 
1319,"DOCTOR: Well, it's an interesting theory. "
1320,JAMIE: But it fits. 
1321,DOCTOR: Hmm.. It doesn't fit this. 
1322,ZOE: Which we can't cut inside.
1323,"JAMIE: Och, it's just a spare part or something. The dead man tried to"
1324,"defend himself, used the quick set plastic, it misfired and went over"
1325,this bit of machinery. 
1326,"DOCTOR: Well, we can find out. "
1327,ZOE: How? 
1328,DOCTOR: With the X-ray machine. 
1329,ZOE: Of course. Why didn't I think of that? 
1330,"JAMIE: Aye, why didn't you? "
1331,"ZOE: Well, all I had to go on was the fact that hyperoxide is"
1332,unbreakable. I just didn't think of X-rays. 
1333,"DOCTOR: Simple common sense works wonders sometimes, Zoe. "
1334,"ZOE: Well, at least you didn't think of X-rays. That would have been"
1335,awful.

1726,rocket. 
1727,"DUGGAN: Well, just don't stand there, go and grab a dozen sticks. With"
1728,"a bit of luck, we can replace these and reassemble in a couple of"

1737,is not as it should be. He lifts a board from the false bottom and
1738,"looks inside, but it is empty. A metallic hand grabs his shoulder."

1753,the loading bay? 
1754,"CASALI: No, I don't think so. I'll check. "
1755,RYAN: What's the problem?

1757,all.

1766,LALEHAM: Cut his hand. He's gone to the Medical bay. 
1767,DUGGAN: Trust him. 
1768,VALLANCE: Anything to be done? 
1769,"DUGGAN: Yeah, you can open up a box of rods. Got this job licked. I"
1770,"just hope the rods are the right dimensions, that's all. "
1771,LALEHAM: They are. 
1772,DUGGAN: Since when have you been a expert? 
1773,VALLANCE: The lasers have to be made operative or the meteorites will
1774,destroy the Wheel. 
1775,"DUGGAN: No. Well why do you think I'm sweating my back off here? Here,"
1776,what's up with him? 
1777,LALEHAM: They're the right ones. 
1778,"DUGGAN: Yes, so they are. You must be psychic. But don't tell the old"

1781,"DUGGAN: Hey, this is perfect. Marvellous! "
1782,VALLANCE: When will the repair be finished? 
1783,DUGGAN: It won't be done at all if you keep nattering. 
1784,VALLANCE: The meteorites must not harm the Wheel. 
1785,"DUGGAN: That storm really worries you, doesn't it? Well, don't let it,"
1786,don't let it. It'll be a close call but I reckon to have this laser
1787,ready and in operation in six to seven hours. So you can sleep in your

1805,"CORWYN: Oh, Zoe, it's you. What do you want? "
1806,"ZOE: Well, it's rather difficult to explain. "
1807,CORWYN: What is it? 
1808,"ZOE: Well, I've done a report. Some calculations I've been doing. I was"
1809,ordered to forget them. 
1810,CORWYN: Ordered? By whom? What report? 
1811,ZOE: My calculations on the orbital path of the meteorite storm. I
1812,found a new element which indicated a critical state and I reported my
1813,findings to the Controller. 
1814,CORWYN: And he ignored them. 
1815,"ZOE: Yes. Well, you don't sound very surprised. "
1816,CORWYN: No. 
1817,"ZOE: Well, he said it was all perfectly normal, but it isn't. "
1818,CORWYN: He's getting worse. 
1819,ZOE: Is he ill? 
1820,CORWYN: I don't know yet. 
1821,"ZOE: Well, if he is he's chosen a rather inconvenient time, hasn't he? "
1822,"CORWYN: Do you ever feel anything emotional, Zoe? "
1823,"ZOE: Emotional? Do you know, that's the second time I've been asked"
1824,that in the last few hours. Leo Ryan said that I was all brains and no
1825,heart. 
1826,"CORWYN: Yes, it's your training. I shouldn't worry about it. "
1827,"ZOE: Oh, but I do. I don't want to be thought of as a freak. Leo said I"
1828,"was like a robot, a machine. I think he's right. My head's been pumped"
1829,"full of facts and figures which I reel out automatically when needed,"
1830,"but, well, I want to feel things as well. "
1831,CORWYN: Good. Unfortunately the parapsychology unit at the City tends
1832,to ignore this aspect in its pupils. Some of them never fully develop
1833,their human emotions. 
1834,"ZOE: You don't think I'll be like that, do you? "
1835,"CORWYN: No. No, you seemed to have survived their brain-washing"
1836,techniques remarkably well. 
1837,"ZOE: Oh, good. "
1838,"CORWYN: Now, about these calculations of yours."

1843,LERNOV: And this last one is how we check everything. 
1844,DOCTOR: I see. 
1845,"RYAN: Yes, anything that uses energy on the Wheel, however small, is"
1846,registered on this wall. From a coffee-grinder upwards 
1847,DOCTOR: Do you have any coffee? 
1848,RYAN: Would you like some? 
1849,"DOCTOR: I'd love some, I really would. "
1850,LERNOV: I have a coffee pellet. Would you like one? 
1851,DOCTOR: That's better than nothing. 
1852,(Zoe enters and catches their attention.) 
1853,"RYAN: Excuse me, Doctor. Tanya. "
1854,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, of course. "
1855,"JAMIE: Doctor, don't forget we need that mercury stuff for the Tardis. "
1856,"DOCTOR: No, Jamie, I haven't forgotten. I'm worried about the Tardis."
1857,If I'm right and those Cybermen are. What's going on? 
1858,(There's an intense conversation happening.) 
1859,JAMIE: Let's find out. 
1860,"DOCTOR: What's going on, Zoe? "
1861,ZOE: I've done some new calculations on the orbital path of the
1862,meteorite storm. They're heading toward us faster than we thought. 
1863,JAMIE: Don't you have any cheerful news? 
1864,"ZOE: Facts are facts, and these are indisputable. "
1865,DOCTOR: I wouldn't dream of contradicting you. Can you repair the laser
1866,gun in time? 
1867,"ZOE: Well, that's not the worry, it's the Controller. I went to him"
1868,with the new data on the meteorites and he just brushed the whole thing
1869,aside. 
1870,"DOCTOR: Oh dear, he's getting worse. "
1871,"ZOE: That what Doctor Corwyn says. He is ill, isn't he? "
1872,DOCTOR: Why aren't you worried about the laser gun? I thought all of
1873,the Bernalium has been destroyed. 
1874,"ZOE: Oh no, some more turned up. "
1875,DOCTOR: Oh good. 
1876,"ZOE: Yes, two of the men bought a crate of it over from the rocket. "
1877,DOCTOR: Ah. What? What did you say? 
1878,"ZOE: Well, that's what Flannigan said. I met him when he was going off"
1879,duty. 
1880,"DOCTOR: Gemma! Gemma, did you know about this Bernalium from the"
1881,rocket? 
1882,"CORWYN: Yes, Tanya told me. "
1883,DOCTOR: Don't you see what it means? The Cybermen are here. They came
1884,over in that crate. 
1885,CORWYN: But how could our two men have bought them over? 
1886,DOCTOR: But they didn't know what they were doing. They were just
1887,obeying orders. 
1888,CORWYN: The Cybermen hypnotised them? 
1889,"DOCTOR: Yes, something like that. "
1890,"CORWYN: We're not exactly children, Doctor. All spacemen are protected"
1891,against brain-control by drugs. 
1892,"DOCTOR: Yes, but a psychotropic drug is only effective against a known"
1893,enemy. Have you induced repulsion in all parts of the brain yet? 
1894,"CORWYN: No, but then there's the implanted Silenski capsules. It gives"
1895,off a signal when there is an adverse influence against the wearer. 
1896,DOCTOR: How can we check? 
1897,"CORWYN: Tanya, I want to check the Silenski circuit. "
1898,LERNOV: But I shall have to activate the whole defence network. 
1899,CORWYN: I'll authorise the extra power. 
1900,LERNOV: Watch the lines. If they're steady then everything is normal. 
1901,DOCTOR: I see. 
1902,LERNOV: Try this room first. 
1903,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, please. Is that all right? "
1904,(Jamie and Zoe see Duggan.) 
1905,JAMIE: What's he hanging around for? I thought that he was under guard
1906,or something. 
1907,"ZOE: So did I. Bill, has the Controller "
1908,(Duggan ignores Zoe and goes past.) 
1909,"LERNOV: Here, Wait a minute. Look. "
1910,"CORWYN: Someone is affected, Doctor. You were right. "
1911,LERNOV: Someone in this room. 
1912,"DOCTOR: Er, can we pin it down to an individual? "
1913,"LERNOV: I'll quarter the room off. Over there, in the direction of "
1914,"DOCTOR: No, stop him! "
1915,(Duggan smashes the communications desk with a heavy spanner. It goes
1916,"bang, killing Duggan.) "
1917,"DOCTOR: He's dead. Now, now listen, listen everyone. The Cybermen are"
1918,"here, in this Wheel. They took over this poor fellow to stop you"
1919,"sending for help or signalling to Earth. Now just a minute. Gemma, you"
1920,must alert the whole Wheel and you'll need something stronger than
1921,drugs to stop your people from being taken over. It doesn't matter how
1922,crude it is. A metal plate and a transistor will do. Tape them to the
1923,back of the neck. It will absorb the Cyber control signals. 
1924,RYAN: I can do that. 
1925,DOCTOR: Yes. Good. 
1926,LERNOV: I'll help you. 
1927,DOCTOR: Right. 
1928,JAMIE: What do we do? 
1929,"DOCTOR: We're going hunting, Jamie. "
1930,JAMIE: Are you sure you know who's going to be hunted. 
1931,DOCTOR: A very good question. Come on. 
1932,(The Doctor and Jamie leave.) 
1933,ZOE: Can I do something?

1964,"From the outside it's strong enough, but now that the Cybermen are"
1965,"inside, I "
1966,"JAMIE: Yes, I see what you mean. What do you think they are planning? "
1967,"DOCTOR: Well, they obviously don't want to destroy the Wheel. "
1968,"JAMIE: What do they want, then? "
1969,DOCTOR: I wish I knew. The first thing we must do is to protect the
1970,people here. 
1971,JAMIE: How? 
1972,DOCTOR: What's the thing which we need to survive which the Cybermen
1973,don't?

1984,RYAN: Yes. 
1985,LERNOV: Leo says that he can. Why? 
1986,DOCTOR : The Cybermen are definitely on the Wheel. Jamie
1987,and I have just seen one. They may try to interfere with the air
1988,supply. 
1989,JAMIE : Doctor.

1996,CORWYN: Yes. 
1997,RYAN: Sealing off all the airlocks. 
1998,LERNOV: I suppose that we can trust the Doctor?

2146,back on Earth. Now come on. 
2147,LALEHAM: Don't touch that. 
2148,FLANNIGAN: You just can't ignore it. What is it? What's the matter with
2149,"you two, hey? "
2150,VALLANCE: Just do as you're told. 
2151,"FLANNIGAN: Hey now, have you both gone mad or what? "
2152,(Vallance points a gun at Flannigan.) 
2153,"FLANNIGAN: Don't point that thing at me, laddie. "
2154,(Flannigan knocks the gun from Vallance's hand and floors him. Laleham
2155,brandishes a crowbar.) 
2156,"FLANNIGAN: All right. If it's a fight you're after, I'm your man. Come"
2157,on. 
2158,(Laleham swings the crowbar and misses.) 
2159,"FLANNIGAN: You need a few lessons in the noble and manly arts, me"
2160,"bucko! All right, come on! "
2161,"(Laleham and Flannigan fight, and Vallance picks up his weapon."
2162,"Vallance fires, missing Flannigan and killing Laleham instead. A"
2163,Cyberman enters and hypnotises Flannigan.) 
2164,CYBERMAN: The Earth machine has been installed? 
2165,VALLANCE: Yes. 
2166,CYBERMAN: A force field has been set around the Operations Control

2177,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm not surprised you can't get in touch with the rest of"
2178,the Wheel. 
2179,"JAMIE: Aye, the Cybermen aren't going to sit around and do nothing. "
2180,CORWYN: But can they still control our people? I thought you'd 
2181,"DOCTOR: With the metal plates, you mean. Has everybody had them fitted"
2182,to the back of their necks? 
2183,"CORWYN: No, not yet. There are still some crew members without. "
2184,"DOCTOR: Well, it would be advisable to have it done. "
2185,RYAN: Coming through now. 
2186,CASALI: I lost them for a moment there. 
2187,(Everyone goes over to the radar screen.) 
2188,"CASALI: Hey, will you listen to that? Now this is a big storm, bigger"
2189,than we thought. 
2190,"RYAN: All right, all right, don't make it worse. "
2191,CORWYN: We'll have to rely on the anti-matter field projectors. 
2192,"CASALI: Hey, you don't think the meteorites are going to bounce off"
2193,"them, do you? We're talking about things weighing two or three hundred"
2194,tons here.

2206,RYAN: The laser's repaired? 
2207,FLANNIGAN : It is ready for testing now. 
2208,"RYAN: Great. The laser's working. Stand by to run a test. Flannigan,"
2209,where have you been? I've been trying to raise you for ages. 
2210,FLANNIGAN : There must be a fault on the line. Vallance is

2212,RYAN: Right. 
2213,"(A hatch opens on the outer surface of the Wheel, and a laser cannon"

2224,"DOCTOR: Well, it would be as well not to miss then, wouldn't it. "
2225,RYAN: We'll try a random shot. At least we'll see how the power bank
2226,reacts. Stand by to test laser. Blue button. Red on stand by.

2246,"RYAN: Well, let'em all come. We're ready for them. "
2247,DOCTOR: I think it is reasonable to assume that the Cybermen caused
2248,that star to go nova. 
2249,CORWYN: Deliberately causing the meteorites to deflect from their orbit
2250,"to destroy the Wheel, you mean? "
2251,DOCTOR: No. Not to destroy the Wheel. To make you want to use the
2252,laser. Then they sent in their Cybermats to attack the laser and
2253,destroy the Bernalium. 
2254,JAMIE: And then you'd search that drifting rocket and find a big crate.
2255,
2256,DOCTOR: With the Cybermen inside it. 
2257,JAMIE: Aye. 
2258,DOCTOR: It was only way they could get into the Wheel. 
2259,CORWYN: And now you think they've repaired the laser. 
2260,"JAMIE: They must have done, otherwise they'd be smashing up the Wheel,"
2261,wouldn't they? 
2262,DOCTOR: So you see this isn't just an attack by an alien race on a
2263,space station. The Cybermen have another purpose. 
2264,CORWYN: What? 
2265,"DOCTOR: They have an over-riding ambition to invade the Earth, plunder"
2266,"its mineral wealth, and somehow they see a way of doing it through this"
2267,Wheel. 
2268,CORWYN: But how can we stop them? 
2269,DOCTOR: I don't know. 
2270,CORWYN: Presumably these Cybermen disposed of the crewmembers of the
2271,rocket in space? 
2272,"DOCTOR: Hmm? Yes. Jamie, the Time Vector Generator from the Tardis."
2273,Where is it? 
2274,JAMIE: Oh you mean the gold rod thing? 
2275,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, where is it? "
2276,JAMIE: You've got it. I put it your pocket in the rocket. 
2277,DOCTOR: Are you sure? 
2278,JAMIE: Yes? 
2279,DOCTOR: But I haven't got it. 
2280,JAMIE: You must have. Not unless it's fallen out when they were moving
2281,you. Is it important? 
2282,DOCTOR: Important? Someone'll have to go over to the rocket to get it. 
2283,JAMIE: Good luck to them. Who's going? 
2284,"DOCTOR: Well, if Gemma can spare someone to show you how to make the"
2285,journey. 
2286,JAMIE: Me? 
2287,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. You're the only one who knows what it looks"
2288,"like besides me, and I'm much too busy. Besides, it's your fault that"
2289,it's lost.

2442,"of course, they weren't actually hit by any of that rubbish. "
2443,DOCTOR: Do you think I don't know that? It was a calculated risk that

2446,DOCTOR: Because there's something on board that rocket that we've got
2447,to have if we're going to beat the Cybermen.

2583,"CASALI: It's not a meteorite. Look, it's changing course. "
2584,LERNOV: There are no ships due in this part of space. 
2585,"CASALI: Anyway, it's too big for one of our ships. "
2586,DOCTOR: It could be a Cyberman spaceship. 
2587,RYAN: Moving in for the kill. 
2588,DOCTOR: Possibly. 
2589,"RYAN: What about radio, Rico? We must contact Earth for assistance. "
2590,"CASALI: Oh no, not a chance, though I could fix it up okay but I need"
2591,some transistors and they're in the Power Room. 
2592,RYAN: Then one of us will have to go and get 'em.
2593,
2594, [Rocket control room]
2595,
2596,PLANNER : Positive. The Doctor is known and
2597,recorded. An enemy. He must be lured outside the force field and
2598,destroyed. 
2599,"JAMIE: They're going to try and trap the Doctor. Come on, let's get"
2600,back and warn him.
2601,
2602, [Wheel Operations room]
2603,
2604,(Looking at blueprints of the Wheel.) 
2605,LERNOV: And these are corridors leading to Power Room. 
2606,RYAN: Well that's no good. We don't know where those Cybermen'll be. 
2607,LERNOV: How else is he going to get there? Though the cable tunnels? 
2608,"RYAN: No, no, they're blocked off here and here. That just leaves the"
2609,emergency air tunnel. 
2610,FLANNIGAN : Captain. 
2611,RYAN: Flannigan! Where are you? 
2612,FLANNIGAN : In the corridor outside the Spares and
2613,Workshop. I've got a whole bunch of them locked up in the Workshop. 
2614,RYAN: Is the way clear through to the Power House? 
2615,"FLANNIGAN : It is, but they're melting down the doors. I"
2616,can't hold them for much longer. 
2617,"RYAN: Well, look, one of us has got to come for some radio spares. Will"
2618,you bottle them up as long as possible? 
2619,FLANNIGAN : Right. I will seal off the other compartments
2620,but you'd better send someone quickly for them spares. 
2621,RYAN: Right. 
2622,FLANNIGAN : They may be trying the other doors. 
2623,DOCTOR: Excuse me. Tell him I will go for the spares. 
2624,"RYAN: You? Well, surely it's better if I go. "
2625,DOCTOR: I think that it's essential that I go. 
2626,"RYAN: All right, it's your neck. Look, Flannigan, the Doctor's coming"
2627,"for the spares. Now, hold them back for as long as you can. "
2628,FLANNIGAN : I will meet up with the Doctor in corridor six.
2629,
2630,RYAN: Right. 
2631,"DOCTOR: Now listen, as soon as Flannigan comes through the force field,"
2632,grab him! 
2633,RYAN: Grab him? What for? 
2634,LERNOV: And he isn't coming here. Didn't you hear him? He's going to
2635,meet you in corridor six. 
2636,DOCTOR: I somehow don't think he will. Now please do as I say. I'll
2637,"have the map. Now remember, don't trust him. Check the metal plate on"
2638,the back of his neck. 
2639,LERNOV: But you'll get 
2640, [Corridor]
2641,
2642,(Flannigan meets a Cyberman.) 
2643,FLANNIGAN: The Doctor is coming to corridor six. 
2644,CYBERMAN: Return to the Operations room. Destroy the force field after
2645,they let you through. 
2646,(Jamie and Zoe are space-walking back to the Wheel.) 
2647,
2648,[Power room]
2649,
2650,(The Doctor opens a grating in the wall and climbs
2651,through. He goes over to a trolley
2652,and picks up a small bottle.) 
2653,"DOCTOR: Ah, mercury. "
2654,"(He pockets the bottle, picks up a circuit board and checks the"
2655,corridor outside is clear. Then he goes to a workbench and picks up
2656,some coils of wire.)
2657,"DOCTOR: Yes, I don't see why it shouldn't work. "
2658,[Landing bay]
2659,
2660,"(Out of their spacesuits, Jamie and Zoe come in"
2661,through the emergency exit and see Corwyn on the floor.) 
2662,JAMIE: Doctor Corwyn! 
2663,(She is clearly dead. They go up the steps. Shortly afterwards they
2664,walk through a door labelled Oxygen Supply room into -)
2665,
2666, [Corridor]
2667,
2668,ZOE: Flannigan! 
2669,FLANNIGAN: What are you two doing wandering about? Them creatures are
2670,all over the place. 
2671,JAMIE: We know they are. 
2672,FLANNIGAN: Follow me. This way's quicker. 
2673,"(Flannigan, Zoe and Jamie leave, the Cyberman and Vallance enter.) "
2674,CYBERMAN: The Doctor has not come. 
2675,VALLANCE: He must have gone another way. 
2676,CYBERMAN: How? 
2677,VALLANCE: Through the air tunnels. There is one leading to the Power
2678,Room. 
2679,CYBERMAN: Show me.
2680,
2681, [Wheel Operations room]
2682,
2683,(Flannigan enters with Jamie and Zoe. Ryan spots
2684,him and grabs him before he can touch a control panel.) 
2685,"JAMIE: Hey, what you doing? "
2686,ZOE: He led us here! 
2687,LERNOV: He was under Cyberman influence. 
2688,JAMIE: What? 
2689,(Ryan puts the anti-hypnosis device on the back of Flannigan's neck.) 
2690,"RYAN: Right, he'll be all right now. Sit him down over there for a"
2691,"while, Rico. "
2692,ZOE: You mean he was being controlled? 
2693,RYAN: Yes. You were dead lucky. 
2694,"JAMIE: Aye. Here, where's the Doctor? The Cybermen are going to try and"
2695,lure him away and trap him. 
2696,LERNOV: He's already gone. 
2697,JAMIE: What? 
2698,DOCTOR : I've got the spares. 
2699,"JAMIE: Doctor, be careful! "
2700,DOCTOR : Jamie! Oh thank heavens. Are you and Zoe all
2701,right? 
2702,JAMIE: Yes. Now listen. The Cybermen know you're on the Wheel. They're
2703,going to try and trap you. 
2704,"DOCTOR : Yes, yes, I guessed they would. Have you got the"
2705,Time Vector Generator? 
2706,JAMIE: Yes. 
2707,"DOCTOR : Good! Now, now listen to me, I want you to bring"
2708,it to me. Get someone to show you the way through the air corridors.
2709,Hello. I think I've got company. 
2710,(Transmission ends.) 
2711,JAMIE: Company? What does he mean? (the penny drops) Company!
2712,
2713,[Power room]
2714,
2715,(Two Cyberman are standing in front of the door.) 
2716,DOCTOR: I suppose you've come for me. 
2717,CYBERMAN 1: You know our ways. 
2718,"DOCTOR: Yes, I thought you'd realise somebody did. I imagine you have"
2719,orders to destroy me. 
2720,CYBERMAN 2: Yes. 
2721,DOCTOR: Tell me one thing. Why did you order Duggan to destroy radio
2722,"communication with the Earth? After all, that is why you want"
2723,"possession of the Wheel, isn't it? "
2724,CYBERMAN 1: You know our ways. 
2725,DOCTOR: That doesn't answer my question. 
2726,CYBERMAN 2: He was instructed to destroy only the transmitting complex.
2727,
2728,"DOCTOR: Oh, I see. How interesting. Yes, of course. And presumably your"
2729,"large spaceship holds your invasion fleet, and the smaller ships can"
2730,only enter the Earth's atmosphere by homing on a radio beam. 
2731,CYBERMAN 2: You know our ways. You must be destroyed. 
2732,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I was afraid you'd get back to that. Well, you'd"
2733,better come in. 
2734,"(Cyberman 1 steps forward, the Doctor throws a switch and electricity"
2735,crackles through its headpiece. It collapses. Number two tries to use
2736,its chest unit.) 
2737,"DOCTOR: You can't get through the field, you know. "
2738,CYBERMAN 2: You will be destroyed. Others are coming. 
2739,(Cyberman 2 leaves. The Doctor turns off the electric field. Jamie
2740,comes through the grating with Flannigan.) 
2741,DOCTOR: Jamie! Is he all right? 
2742,JAMIE: Yes. 
2743,FLANNIGAN: I've got a head like a big bass drum. Somebody's going to
2744,pay for this. 
2745,"JAMIE: Oh, it looks like the Doctor's already made one of them pay. "
2746,"DOCTOR: Yes, but they're sending in reinforcements, probably through"
2747,the Loading Bay. Have you got the rod? Thank you. I'm going to try and
2748,"fix this into the laser gun circuit. With any luck, I should be able to"
2749,boost the power enough to destroy the Cyberman spaceship. But you'll
2750,have to hold them off at the loading bay. I need time. 
2751,"FLANNIGAN: Right, leave that to me. "
2752,"DOCTOR: Well, there's still a Cyberman left, so watch out for him. "
2753,(Flannigan picks up a mini-extinguisher.) 
2754,"FLANNIGAN: Well, I think I know just the thing for him. "
2755,DOCTOR: Good. Here's a metal plate for Vallance. 
2756,(Jamie catches it.) 
2757,JAMIE: Leo Ryan says you're to call him. 
2758,(Jamie leaves.) 
2759,FLANNIGAN: Let's see how them creatures like this stuff! 
2760,(Flannigan leaves.)
2761,
2762, [Wheel Operations room]
2763,
2764,CASALI: That ship's closing in on us. 
2765,DOCTOR : I'm trying to put some extra power in your laser.
2766,Line it up on the Cyberman spaceship and I'll let you know when I'm
2767,ready. 
2768,"RYAN: Right. Well you'd better hurry, Doctor. That ship's moving toward"
2769,us. 
2770,"DOCTOR : Yes, I know. They're going to invade us."
2771,
2772,[Loading bay]
2773,
2774,(Jamie and Flannigan are in full space suits. The
2775,Cyberman and Vallance are there. Vallance is also suited up.) 
2776,FLANNIGAN: I could not get through the force field to the Operations
2777,"room, and I caught this man on the way back. "
2778,CYBERMAN: He is not important.
2779,
2780,[Power room]
2781,
2782,"RYAN : Hurry, Doctor. Hurry! "
2783,"DOCTOR: Yes, all right."
2784,
2785,[Loading bay]
2786,
2787,(A group of Cybermen are spacewalking to the Wheel.
2788,"When the Cyberman turns his back, Flannigan and Jamie approach"
2789,"Vallance, and Jamie puts the metal plate on the back of his helmet.) "
2790,JAMIE: Got it! Flannigan! 
2791,(The Cyberman walks towards them so Flannigan uses his extinguisher
2792,"device on its chest unit. It turns out to be quick drying plastic, and"
2793,the Cyberman collapses as it reaches for the door controls. The
2794,spacewalking Cybermen are just paces away as Flannigan shuts the outer
2795,"doors, but the lead one wedges itself between them and tries to force"
2796,them open.) 
2797,JAMIE: Use the plastic again. 
2798,FLANNIGAN: I can't. I wasted it all on the other one.
2799,
2800, [Wheel Operations room]
2801,
2802,DOCTOR : Right. Everything is ready
2803,here. 
2804,"LERNOV: Ready, Leo. "
2805,RYAN: Red on standby. And fire! 
2806,(The Cybermen's space ship goes KaBOOM!) 
2807,[Loading bay]
2808,
2809,FLANNIGAN: I'll try and operate the neutron
2810,force-field. Hold tight! 
2811,"(The forcefield repels the Cybermen, and the outer doors close."
2812,Flannigan repressurises the bay and they all remove their helmets.) 
2813,"JAMIE: Oh, we've done it."

2816,
2817,"CASALI: Earth Central, stand by for emergency"
2818,report. 
2819,VOICE : Earth Central. Contract clear. Standing by. 
2820,RYAN: Where's Zoe? 
2821,LERNOV: She's gone to take the Doctor and Jamie back to the rocket. 
2822,VOICE : Earth Central standing by with recording apparatus.
2823,Commence report. 
2824,"RYAN: Hello, Earth Central. This is Captain Ryan, acting controller of"
2825,Station Three. 
2826,"VOICE : Recording in progress. Go ahead, Captain. "
2827,RYAN: Preliminary report on communications failure. Radio contact lost
2828,at approximately twelve fifty two hours due to invasion of alien force.
2829,Full report to follow. All systems now operational. Request official
2830,permission to assume responsibility.
2831,
2832, [Rocket control room]
2833,
2834,ZOE: So I've just got to go back? 
2835,JAMIE: I'm afraid so. 
2836,"ZOE: And you won't tell me anything about this, what is it? "
2837,JAMIE: Tardis. 
2838,"ZOE: Oh, yes. I asked the Doctor what it meant. Time And Relative"
2839,"Dimensions In Space, he said. "
2840,"JAMIE: Er, yes. "
2841,ZOE: But you won't explain it. 
2842,"JAMIE: Well, you see Zoe, it's, well, it's like two different worlds."
2843,"Look, you've got yours and the Doctor and me have ours. "
2844,DOCTOR : Jamie! 
2845,"JAMIE: Look, you've been. Well, look, Zoe, we won't forget you."
2846,
2847,[Tardis]
2848,
2849,(The Doctor pours the mercury through a funnel into
2850,"the console, then switches on.) "
2851,JAMIE: All set? 
2852,DOCTOR: Yes. I've even got some mercury left over. 
2853,"JAMIE: Oh, we can go then. "
2854,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think "
2855,(The lid of a carved blanket box or chest lowers itself gently.) 
2856,"DOCTOR: Just a little matter to settle first, I think, Jamie. "
2857,(The Doctor knocks on the lid and opens it.) 
2858,"JAMIE: Hey, I thought I told you "
2859,ZOE: I want to go with you. 
2860,"JAMIE: Well, it's impossible. "
2861,"DOCTOR: Now, Jamie, it's not impossible. It's something that we have to"
2862,decide. You may change your mind. 
2863,"ZOE: No, I won't. "
2864,"DOCTOR: I wonder. Zoe, watch the screen up there. "
2865,(The Doctor takes a small head piece from behind a roundel and puts it
2866,on.) 
2867,JAMIE: What are you going to do? 
2868,DOCTOR: I'm going to show Zoe the sort of thing that she may be in for.
2869,
2870,ZOE: Thought patterns? 
2871,DOCTOR: Yes. Only I'm going to weave them into a complete story for
2872,you. Have you ever heard of the Daleks? 
2873,ZOE: No. 
2874,DOCTOR: Then watch. 
2875,DALEK : Who are you? Who are you? Answer!
