23, (A pair of potholers climb down a metal 'rope'
24,ladder into a large cave with extraordinary stalagmites.) 
25,"SPENCER: Well, this is fantastic! "
26,(Something roars in the distance.) 
27,SPENCER: What was that? 
28,DAVIS: Nothing. 
29,"(They move off. The young man, Spencer tries to take the lead.) "
30,DAVIS: Wait. 
31,"(Davis leads off down a tunnel. There is another gurgling roar, closer"
32,now. Davis goes through a gap to confront - ) 
33,DAVIS: Spencer! 
34,"(Something very tall with big teeth, looking rather amphibian. It"
35,attacks Davis.) 
36,DAVIS: Spencer! 
37,(Spencer finds Davis' body and runs in terror.)

39, [UNIT garage workshop]
40,
41, (The Doctor is happy in his work underneath a
42,"bright yellow 1930s style car, registration WHO 1.) "
43,"DOCTOR: (singing.) 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves, Did gyre and"
44,gimble in the wabe 
45,LIZ : Doctor? 
46,"DOCTOR: Come on, Bessie, be more co-operative. All mimsy were the"
47,"borogroves, And the mome raths "
48,LIZ: Doctor. 
49,"DOCTOR: Outgrabe. Oh, hello, Liz. "
50,LIZ: You'll never get that thing running. 
51,"DOCTOR: Oh, don't you be so disrespectful. I'll have you know this is a"
52,car of great character. I was very lucky to get her. 
53,LIZ: Are you really going to drive about in it? 
54,"DOCTOR: Yes, certainly. I've nearly finished my modifications. I"
55,thought we'd take her out for a trial run in a minute. 
56,(He looks at a steel hoop.) 
57,"DOCTOR: Now I wonder what that's for. Oh, well. "
58,LIZ: Urgent message from the Brigadier. 
59,"DOCTOR: Oh he's away, isn't he, investigating some scientists? "
60,"LIZ: Yes, well, he wants us to join him. 'Miss Shaw and the Doctor will"
61,report themselves forthwith to Wenley Moor. Attend a briefing meeting
62,at precisely 
63,"DOCTOR: My dear Miss Shaw, I never report myself anywhere. Particularly"
64,not forthwith. 
65,"LIZ: Oh, it's just his way of putting things. "
66,"DOCTOR: No, I'm sorry, Liz. I won't go. I'm far too busy. "
67,"LIZ: Come on, Doctor. "
68,"DOCTOR: Twee. Twas brillig, and the slithy toves "
69,LIZ: It would make a nice a nice trip for us. We could visit the caves.
70,
71,DOCTOR: Caves? What caves? 
72,"LIZ: Well, that part of the country's famous for them. "
73,DOCTOR: Oh. Is it? 
74,LIZ: It is. 
75,"DOCTOR: Oh, all right then. I'll drive you up there in Bessie. "
76,LIZ: Bessie? 
77,"DOCTOR: There, Bessie. "
78,(The car.) 
79,LIZ: I see. 
80,(The Doctor plants a kiss on Bessie's radiator and the engine starts.) 
81,"DOCTOR: Well, there we are. Here, hold that, Liz, will you? "
82,"(The Doctor drives Liz through town streets carefully, and along unmade"
83,country tracks at high speed until they reach a Research facility in
84,"the middle of a moor. Okay, it is actually the Hogs Back radio"
85,"transmitter site near Guildford, but so what?) "
86, [Conference room]
87,
88,(A briefing is being given to a room full of white
89,"coated scientists, with slides projected onto a screen at the back of"
90,the small stage.) 
91,LAWRENCE: I trust that point is clear. And I would emphasise again that
92,"despite the presence of our friends from UNIT, to whom we shall give"
93,"every possible co-operation, this problem is, I am sure, a scientific"
94,one. 
95,(A UNIT soldier enters and whispers to the Brigadier.) 
96,LAWRENCE: It is our duty as scientists to deal with it ourselves. Only
97,by exercising redoubled vigilance in all our duties can we track down
98,the errors that are holding back the work of this research centre. 
99,(The soldier and the Brigadier leave.)
100,
101, [Corridor]
102,
103, LAWRENCE : The work of this research centre is
104,vitally
105,
106, [Research Centre reception]
107,
108," BRIGADIER: Ah, there you are at last. "
109,DOCTOR: There you are at last. 
110,BRIGADIER: Right. 
111,(The soldier leaves and a security officer gives Liz her papers back.) 
112,DOCTOR: And just where are we? 
113,BRIGADIER: In a cave. 
114,LIZ: We can see that. 
115,BRIGADIER: Or rather in an atomic research centre which has been built
116,into these caves. 
117,DOCTOR: Why? More security? 
118,BRIGADIER: Exactly. 
119,"DOCTOR: Look, may I ask you, why am I here? "
120,"BRIGADIER: Come this way, will you? The meeting's waiting. "
121, [Conference room] 
122, LAWRENCE: We are already very considerably behind
123,"in our research programme, and I am deter "
124,"(The Brigadier, Liz and the Doctor enter.) "
125,"LAWRENCE: And I am determined we shall recover our lost ground, and go"
126,"on to make the new and important discoveries that lie ahead. All right,"
127,that will be all. 
128,(The scientists leave and three men in suits stay behind. Quinn bumps
129,into a woman.) 
130,"QUINN: Oh, I'm sorry. "
131,(Everyone say Hi! to  Fulton
132,MacKay.) 
133,"BRIGADIER: Gentlemen, my colleagues, Miss Elizabeth Shaw and the"
134,"Doctor. Doctor Lawrence, director of this establishment. "
135,LAWRENCE: How do you do. 
136,"BRIGADIER: His number two, Doctor Quinn. "
137,QUINN: Hello. 
138,"DOCTOR: Hello, Doctor Quinn. "
139,"BRIGADIER: Major Baker, station security officer. Doctor Lawrence,"
140,perhaps you'd be good enough to put my colleagues in the picture. 
141,LAWRENCE: This establishment consists basically of a device for
142,"research into the nature of the atom. Cyclotron, otherwise known as a"
143,"proton accelerator. It, er "
144,(The Doctor wanders round the room.) 
145,LAWRENCE: It bombards atoms with subatomic particles. 
146,DOCTOR: Why? 
147,"LAWRENCE: We are on the verge of discovering a way to provide cheap,"
148,"safe, atomic energy for virtually every kind of use. "
149,"QUINN: We're developing a new kind of nuclear reactor, one which"
150,converts nuclear energy directly to electrical power. 
151,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, that's all very well, but what is going wrong? "
152,"BRIGADIER: Two things. First, an abnormally high rate of personnel"
153,trouble. Nervous breakdowns. Absenteeism. Accidents. But the really
154,"serious problem, is the power losses. "
155,LAWRENCE: There have been a certain number of unexplained leakages in
156,the power supplied by the nuclear generator. I am confident we shall
157,find an explanation. 
158,"BRIGADIER: You haven't found one yet, Doctor Lawrence. That's why I'm"
159,here. 
160,"QUINN: Well, it's a highly complex piece of machinery. Naturally there"
161,are problems. 
162,DOCTOR: Naturally. 
163,BRIGADIER: Now there are three possible approaches to this problem.
164,Security. 
165,BAKER: Everything has been double-checked. 
166,"BRIGADIER: Then you will triple-check it, Major Baker, under my"
167,"supervision, clear? "
168,BAKER: Sir. 
169,BRIGADIER: Personnel. This will be dealt with by Miss Shaw. 
170,"LIZ: Oh, yes? "
171,"BRIGADIER: Yes. Finally, the purely scientific angle. Now, the Doctor"
172,"here. What is it, Doctor? "
173,DOCTOR: It's the most extraordinary thing. I can't seem to find my
174,sonic screwdriver anywhere. 
175,LAWRENCE: You're not proposing to dismantle a piece of equipment worth
176,fifteen million pounds with a screwdriver? 
177,"DOCTOR: Well, it's not worth fifteen million pins if it doesn't work,"
178,is it? 
179,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, I suggest you start by just looking round. "
180,"QUINN: Yes, let me take you both over the installation. "
181,"DOCTOR: Splendid. Come on, Liz. Doctor Quinn, which way do we go? "
182,QUINN: To the left. 
183,DOCTOR: To the left. 
184,"(Liz, the Doctor and Quinn leave.) "
185,"LAWRENCE: Brigadier, I shall expect to hear from you as soon as you've"
186,anything to report. You'll see that our work is disrupted as little as
187,possible. 
188,"BRIGADIER: Of course, sir. I'll use this room as my HQ if I may. "
189,"LAWRENCE: Very well. And, er, I should be grateful if you could hurry"
190,"things up, Brigadier. I want this place working normally again. "
191,"BRIGADIER: We all do, sir. "
192,(Lawrence leaves. Baker looks outside to make sure that he has gone.) 
193,"BAKER: I must say, sir, that I fail to see the necessity for the"
194,involvement of UNIT. 
195,BRIGADIER: How long have these disturbances been going on? 
196,BAKER: Three months. 
197,BRIGADIER: There's your answer. 
198,BAKER: Sir? 
199,BRIGADIER: Something's been happening here which is outside the normal
200,"security pattern, and that is precisely the business of UNIT. "
201,BAKER: Sir. I think I have the solution. 
202,BRIGADIER: Have you? 
203,"BAKER: Someone has been carrying out a planned, deliberate programme of"
204,sabotage from the inside.
205,
206, [Cyclotron control room]
207,
208, (The lady scientist Quinn bumped into is speaking
209,into a microphone as Liz and the Doctor enter with Quinn.) 
210,DAWSON: Electron voltage readings 
211,QUINN: Here we are. Can you manage? Now this is the very 
212,DAWSON: Initiate circuit check. 
213,"QUINN: Heart of the cyclotron. Literally so. In fact, we're actually"
214,inside the machine itself. 
215,"(On the other side of the glass screens, scientists work near a large"
216,circular device in the wall which is pulsing pink.) 
217,DOCTOR: You have your own nuclear reactor then? 
218,"QUINN: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. The cyclotron uses power in enormous"
219,quantities. Would you care to step down?
220,
221,[Cyclotron room]
222,
223, DOCTOR: What happens if one of these power losses
224,occurs at a particularly crucial time? 
225,"QUINN: So far, we've always managed to stabilise. "
226,LIZ: If you didn't? 
227,"QUINN: Well, theoretically "
228,DOCTOR: Your nuclear reactor could turn into a massive atomic bomb. 
229,LIZ: You ought to shut down the place at once. 
230,QUINN: That would be a decision for the Director. 
231,DOCTOR: A decision he might be reluctant to make? 
232,QUINN: Doctor Lawrence has the research programme very much at heart. 
233,(Liz is suddenly slightly dizzy.) 
234,LIZ: Oh. I think I'd better make a start on the personnel files. I
235,wonder if someone could show me where to go. 
236,"QUINN: Oh yes, of course. Mister Roberts, take this young lady across"
237,"to Doctor Meredith in the medical wing, will you? "
238,"DOCTOR: Are you all right, Liz? "
239,"LIZ: Yes, yes, I'm fine. "
240,"ROBERTS: (a nice trimmed beard) Yes, of course. Come this way, please. "
241,"DOCTOR: I'll join you later, Liz. "
242,LIZ: Okay. 
243,(Roberts and Liz leave.) 
244,QUINN: You don't mind if I carry on? 
245,"DOCTOR: No, no, please do. "
246,(Quinn works at a control desk.) 
247,"DOCTOR: Quite an achievement, building this centre in these caves. "
248,"QUINN: Yes, there are miles of them still in their natural state."
249,Breathtaking. Ever been potholing? 
250,"DOCTOR: No, not for a very long time. "
251,"QUINN: No, well I'm very keen on it. At least I was, until "
252,DOCTOR: Until what? 
253,QUINN: A couple of our junior technicians went exploring on their day
254,"off. There was an accident, one of them was killed. The other is still"
255,in the sickbay. 
256,DOCTOR: You have your own doctor? 
257,QUINN: No. Doctor Meredith comes in from the local hospital. 
258,"DOCTOR: This technician, was he badly hurt? "
259,"QUINN: Well, now, I'm not sure. They seem to be hushing it up. "
260,DOCTOR: I wonder why. 
261,QUINN: I beg your pardon? 
262,"DOCTOR: I said, I wonder why. Doctor Quinn, these power losses, do they"
263,take any particular pattern? 
264,"QUINN: As far as we can see, completely random. "
265,"DOCTOR: I see. Well, I wonder whether I could possibly check. A fresh"
266,"eye, you know. "
267,"QUINN: Oh yes, of course. Here's the log. "
268,(The desk phone rings as Quinn hands over a file.) 
269,"QUINN: Excuse me a moment. Quinn here. No, no, no, two three six today."
270,"Now get that right. Two three six. Yes, indeed. "
271,DOCTOR: Doctor Quinn? 
272,QUINN: Excuse me. Yes? 
273,DOCTOR: This log seems to be incomplete. 
274,"QUINN: Look, I'll ring you back. That log should be kept every day."
275,(into microphone) Miss Dawson? 
276,"DAWSON: Yes, Doctor Quinn? "
277,QUINN: Come down here a moment will you? 
278,(Dawson enters.) 
279,QUINN: What an extraordinary thing. 
280,DOCTOR: Hmm. 
281,"QUINN: Miss Dawson, there's a query here. Perhaps you can help. Do you"
282,know who usually keeps this log? 
283,"DAWSON: Oh, it used to be Spencer. "
284,"QUINN: Ah, well, that explains it. Spencer's the chap who got hurt in"
285,the caves. 
286,"DOCTOR: No, Doctor Quinn. I don't think it does explain it. Look. "
287,QUINN: At what? 
288,"DOCTOR: There at the bottom of the page, by the string, the binding?"
289,You'll see a tiny shred of paper. Some of those pages have been torn
290,out. 
291, [Records office]
292,
293,(Liz is going through filing cabinets.) 
294,"MEREDITH: I might be able to help you, if you could only tell me what"
295,you were looking for. 
296,"LIZ: I don't know myself yet, Doctor Meredith. "
297,"MEREDITH: We've had a lot of trouble of course. Mild neuroses,"
298,"imaginative ailments, one nervous breakdown. "
299,"LIZ: Yes, so I see. "
300,MEREDITH: But of course these things are quite unavoidable. 
301,"LIZ: This isn't the only atomic research establishment in the country,"
302,you know. 
303,MEREDITH: The others haven't quite the same problem. Working
304,continuously underground you hardly know day from night down here. 
305,(The Doctor enters.) 
306,"DOCTOR: Ah, Liz, any luck with those records? "
307,MEREDITH: I take it you're yet another member of the UNIT team? 
308,"DOCTOR: Yes. Depressing, isn't it. "
309,LIZ: This is Doctor Meredith. 
310,"DOCTOR: Oh, splendid. Just the chap I wanted to see. Now look, this"
311,"patient of yours, Spencer, the one who was injured in the caves. May I"
312,see him? 
313,"MEREDITH: I'm sorry, that's quite out of the question. "
314,"DOCTOR: Oh, really? Why's that? "
315,"MEREDITH: Because I won't allow it, that's why. I'm about to have him"
316,"moved into hospital. Besides, you have no authority. "
317,"DOCTOR: Doctor Meredith, as an associate of UNIT, I think you will find"
318,that I have the authority to do precisely as I please. May I now see
319,your patient? 
320,"MEREDITH: Oh, it seems I have no choice. All right, but I warn you, it"
321,is at your own risk. 
322,DOCTOR: Thank you.
323,
324, [Sickbay]
325,
326, (Spencer is doing cave paintings on the wall.
327,"Deer, rhino, and a reptilian biped with three eyes...) "
328,DOCTOR: How long has he been behaving like this? 
329,"MEREDITH: Since he came out of his coma, with occasional spells of"
330,trying to throttle me. 
331,DOCTOR: Astonishing. It's quite astonishing. 
332,MEREDITH: It's the only thing that keeps him quiet. 
333,DOCTOR: Was he much of an artist before the accident? 
334,MEREDITH: Not that I know of. 
335,DOCTOR: Excuse me. It's absolutely amazing. 
336,"LIZ: Careful, Doctor. "
337,"DOCTOR: Yes, all right, Liz. "
338,(The Doctor kneels behind Spencer and taps him on the back.) 
339,"DOCTOR: What's this one, old chap? "
340,(Spencer panics.) 
341,"DOCTOR: It's all right, old chap. It's all right. "
342,(Spencer starts to strangle the Doctor.) 
343,DOCTOR: Take it easy. 
344,(Liz and Meredith come to help.) 
345,"DOCTOR: Keep away, Doctor. Leave this to me. It's all right, old chap."
346,Now calm down. Settle down now. 
347,(The Doctor pushes Spencer's hands away from his throat.) 
348,DOCTOR: Calm down. That's it. Steady down now. That's it. Calm down.
349,Nobody's going to hurt you. 
350,MEREDITH: Are you all right? I did warn you. 
351,"DOCTOR: Yes, I'm all right. He's just frightened, that's all. "
352,LIZ: So was I. What's made him like this? 
353,DOCTOR: Some kind of fear. It's absolutely incredible. It's thrown his
354,mind back millions of years!
355,
356, [Cyclotron control room]
357,
358,(A UNIT soldier is standing guard by the door.) 
359,QUINN: Twenty four thirty five. 
360,ROBERTS: Check. 
361,QUINN: Twenty eight over two. 
362,ROBERTS: Check. 
363,"QUINN: Forty seven. Hello, there's something wrong there, isn't there?"
364,"Ah, no wonder. The T one four's not working. You test it today? "
365,"DAWSON: Doctor Quinn, the secondary readings. "
366,"QUINN: Roberts, would you mind testing the T one four? "
367,"ROBERTS: Yes, sir. "
368,(Roberts goes down into the main room. Dawson goes to Quinn and
369,whispers to him.) 
370,DAWSON: I'm frightened. What's going to happen? 
371,QUINN: You mustn't panic. Just behave normally. 
372,"DAWSON: This UNIT investigation, they're bound to discover something. "
373,"QUINN: I know, it's a risk. "
374,"ROBERTS : Twenty four, power normal. "
375,QUINN: Good. 
376,"DAWSON: John, you've got to tell them to stop. At least while these"
377,people are here. 
378,"QUINN: Do you think I haven't? Either they don't listen, or they don't"
379,understand. 
380,DAWSON: They've got to stop! 
381,QUINN: Shush. 
382,"ROBERTS : T one four, S K. "
383,"QUINN: Thank you, Roberts. "
384,"DAWSON: Tell the Brigadier or Baker, they'll help. Before someone else"
385,gets killed. 
386,"QUINN: They wouldn't believe me, and anyway there's far too much at"
387,stake. Now take your hand off. 
388,DAWSON: It's not worth the risk. 
389,QUINN: The knowledge I shall gain is worth any risk. 
390, [Conference room]
391,
392, (The Brigadier hands back a file to Baker. A
393,soldier is unpacking other files.) 
394,"BRIGADIER: It's very comprehensive, Major Baker. "
395,"BAKER: Not quite, sir. There's you and your team. "
396,BRIGADIER: No doubt you'll see to that. 
397,"BAKER: Yes, sir. I checked on your security clearance as soon as you"
398,arrived. Miss Shaw's clearance has just come through. 
399,BRIGADIER: You're very thorough. 
400,"BAKER: This man you call the Doctor, sir, there is nothing on file at"
401,central intelligence records about him. 
402,"BRIGADIER: No, there wouldn't be. "
403,"BAKER: Then may I ask, sir "
404,"BRIGADIER: No, Major Baker, you may not. The Doctor is my personal"
405,responsibility. (The Doctor enters.) 
406,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, very homely. "
407,"BRIGADIER: Right, thank you, Major Baker. We'll have another go at"
408,those files later. 
409,"BAKER: Sir. I shall be in my office, sir. "
410,(Baker leaves with the file in his briefcase.) 
411,DOCTOR: Where exactly is his office? 
412,BRIGADIER: The other end of the corridor. 
413,"DOCTOR: He's very conscientious, isn't he? "
414,"BRIGADIER: Well, he slipped up badly once some years ago, he's been"
415,"trying to make up for it ever since. You'd better look out, Doctor. He"
416,wants to run a security check on you. 
417,DOCTOR: I wish him joy of it. 
418,BRIGADIER: I don't suppose you've found anything? 
419,"DOCTOR: On the contrary. I've found enough to make me very, very"
420,worried.
421,
422, [Cyclotron control room]
423,
424," QUINN: Stand by, stand by. "
425,"LAWRENCE: Everything normal, Doctor Quinn? "
426,"QUINN: Everything is perfectly normal, thank you, Director. We've just"
427,completed final checks. 
428,LAWRENCE: Oh good. 
429,QUINN: I'd like to include some of these supplementary tests. 
430,LAWRENCE: And have our schedule fall even further behind? With UNIT
431,"looking over our shoulder? No, I don't think so. "
432,(Lawrence leaves.) 
433,QUINN: Stand by. Prepare to initiate program two three six.
434,
435, [Cyclotron room] 
436, DAWSON: Two three six. Check. 
437,"QUINN : Proton acceleration, phase three. "
438,DAWSON: Phase three. Check. 
439,"QUINN : Roberts, electron voltage reading please. "
440,(But Roberts is staring at nothing.) 
441,DAWSON: Roberts! Electron voltage readings! 
442,"ROBERTS: Sorry, sir. Electron voltage reading, two thousand million,"
443,power rising. 
444, [Cyclotron control room] 
445, QUINN: Thank you. 
446, [Conference room]
447,
448, BRIGADIER: Cave drawings on the walls? My dear
449,"Doctor, if that's what you call evidence. "
450,DOCTOR: Of course it's evidence. 
451,"BRIGADIER: Look, this poor devil sees his friend killed in an accident,"
452,"he wanders around those caves for hours before they get him out, well"
453,quite naturally he has some kind of breakdown. 
454,DOCTOR: Which turns him into a brilliant Paleolithic cave artist? What
455,"about the logs, then? Those torn out pages? "
456,"BRIGADIER: Now there you may have something. Could be sabotage, I"
457,suppose. 
458,DOCTOR: Ah! 
459,BRIGADIER: Or someone trying to cover up simple incompetence. 
460,"DOCTOR: Lethbridge-Stewart, what on earth is the point of my trying to"
461,discover things for you if you keep turning them down all the time. 
462,BRIGADIER: Then I suggest you discover something I can't dismiss. 
463,"DOCTOR: You're not exactly a little Sherlock Holmes yourself, are you? "
464,(The air conditioning goes quiet and the lights dim.) 
465,DOCTOR: What the devil's that? 
466,"BRIGADIER: It's another power failure. Come on, Doctor Watson."
467,
468, [Cyclotron room]
469,
470," ROBERTS: Power very erratic, sir. "
471, [Cyclotron control room] 
472, (Scientists are rushing in and through to the
473,cyclotron proper.) 
474,"ROBERTS : It keeps dropping off, and then suddenly there's a boost."
475,
476,(Lawrence enters.) 
477,"LAWRENCE: Get that reaction back under control, Doctor Quinn. Shall I"
478,take over? 
479,"QUINN: That won't be necessary, thank you. Stand by. We are going to"
480,close down in carefully measured stages. 
481, [Cyclotron room] 
482, QUINN : There is no need for panic. Just
483,follow normal routine. 
484,DAWSON: Proton acceleration very irregular. 
485,(The pink throb is rainbow coloured now.) 
486, [Cyclotron control room] 
487, QUINN: Close down sector one. 
488,(The Doctor and the Brigadier enter.) 
489,"QUINN: Electron voltage readings, please. "
490, [Cyclotron room] 
491," DAWSON: Six thousand million, still rising. "
492, [Cyclotron control room] 
493," ROBERTS : Sector one closed down, sir. "
494,BRIGADIER: What's going on? 
495,QUINN: Close down sector two. 
496,DOCTOR: They're trying to close down the cyclotron without the nuclear
497,reactions getting out of control. 
498,"ROBERTS  Sector two closed down, sir. "
499,BRIGADIER: I hope they can manage it. Anything we can do? 
500,"DOCTOR: Yes. Keep out of the way, I should think. "
501,QUINN: Close down sector three. 
502, [Cyclotron room] 
503, DAWSON: Power still fluctuating. 
504,"QUINN : Roberts, close down sector three. "
505,"ROBERTS: No, it's no good. I can't! "
506,DAWSON: The power is back on full. Proton acceleration seven thousand
507,"million, still rising. Roberts! Roberts! Roberts! "
508,(Dawson goes to Roberts' control panel and he drags her away with his
509,hands around her neck. She screams. The Doctor and Brigadier grab
510,Roberts.) 
511,QUINN : Shut down sector three. 
512, [Cyclotron control room] 
513, QUINN: Someone take over. Shut down sector three. 
514, [Cyclotron room] 
515, (The Doctor does the deed.) 
516,DOCTOR: Sector three shut down. 
517,"QUINN : Thank you, Doctor. Close down sector four."
518,
519, [Records office]
520,
521," DOCTOR: Now what about those records, Liz. "
522,"LIZ: Well, there's a terrifically high rate of minor neuroses. Two"
523,"hundred percent above the normal, even for a place like this. "
524,DOCTOR: Any pattern? 
525,LIZ: Everyone who was affected worked at one time or another in the
526,cyclotron room. Even I felt odd while I was there. 
527,DOCTOR: Really? In what way? 
528,"LIZ: A feeling of oppression, almost terror. "
529,"DOCTOR: You know, it's obviously something that only affects some"
530,humans. Otherwise they'd all crack up. 
531,LIZ: So you too think it's something to do with the cyclotron room? 
532,"DOCTOR: No, well, not really, but it is the deepest part of the centre."
533,And it's the nearest to those caves. 
534,LIZ: So? 
535,"DOCTOR: Everything leads back to those caves, Liz. Davis was killed"
536,there. Spencer was frightened into becoming a cave man. 
537,LIZ: That reminds me. There's a report here on Davis. 
538,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes? "
539,LIZ: The police forwarded a copy. 
540,DOCTOR: Let's have a look. 
541,LIZ: Even a map showing where they found him. 
542,"DOCTOR: Oh good. (reads) Immediate cause of death, fracture of the"
543,"cranium. Further observations, unusual abrasions on the body, strangely"
544,resembling scratches or claw marks. Presumably caused during fall. Claw
545,marks?
546,
547, [Caves]
548,
549," (Suitably attired, the Doctor climbs down the"
550,ladder and almost immediately hears a roar in the distance. He looks
551,"around and finds a caver's hammer in the gravel, then further along a"
552,coil of rope. The roar is closer. He enters the area of the original
553,attack and is about to leave again when there is another roar. The
554,Doctor turns to see what looks like a dinosaur standing over him.) 
555, Episode Two
556,
557, [Caves] 
558," (As the Doctor drops to the ground, shielding his"
559,"face from the approaching talons, there are three distinct notes"
560,repeated over and over again. The dinosaur leaves. The Doctor goes into
561,the next cave and looks at the yard-long footprint it has left.) 
562, [Conference room]
563,
564, (The Brigadier points to a map of the caves with
565,his swagger stick.) 
566,BRIGADIER: You're sure this is where he's making for? 
567,LIZ: Pretty sure. He wanted to see the exact place where the accident
568,happened. 
569,"BRIGADIER: I must say, Miss Shaw, if only you'd come to me earlier. "
570,LIZ: I'm sorry but he asked me not to tell you. 
571,BRIGADIER: I could have sent down a search party immediately. 
572,LIZ: That's just what he didn't want. 
573,BRIGADIER: He deserves all he gets. No sense at all. 
574,(Baker enters with helmets and rope.) 
575,"BAKER: I've collected all the equipment I can lay my hands on, and I've"
576,alerted the local rescue team. They'll mount a follow-up search as soon
577,as they can. 
578,"LIZ: This is very good of you, Major Baker. "
579,BRIGADIER: I'm only sorry that a member of my staff should be causing
580,so much trouble. We're supposed to be helping you. 
581,BAKER: The main thing is to get your Doctor out of those caves as soon
582,"as possible. How many men have you, sir? "
583,"BRIGADIER: Five or six, and Captain Hawkins. More on the way from HQ. "
584,"BAKER: Well, I suggest we start a preliminary search just as soon as we"
585,can. 
586,BRIGADIER: Right. We'll be ready to go in five minutes. 
587,BAKER: Right sir. 
588,"DOCTOR: Well, this all looks very exciting. May I come too?"
589,
590, [Cyclotron room]
591,
592, LAWRENCE: Surely you must have found some
593,explanation. 
594,QUINN: Both generator and cyclotron are functioning perfectly. Excuse
595,"me. Miss Dawson, electron voltage readings please. "
596,"DAWSON : Two thousand million, power steady, all systems at normal."
597,
598,"LAWRENCE: Everything's in perfect order, except for the fact that these"
599,power losses still keep on recurring. 
600,QUINN: We are trying everything possible. 
601,"LAWRENCE: Yes, I know. I'm sorry. "
602,[Cyclotron control room]
603,
604," QUINN: Thank you, Miss Dawson. "
605,"LAWRENCE: This project started off so well. Still, we're not the only"
606,ones with problems. 
607,QUINN: Oh? 
608,LAWRENCE: UNIT. That ridiculous Doctor of theirs got himself lost in
609,the caves. 
610,QUINN: Are they searching for him? 
611,"LAWRENCE: They were, but the fellow turned up again. "
612,QUINN: That's very fortunate. 
613,"LAWRENCE: Let me know if you find anything wrong, won't you. "
614,QUINN: Yes of course. 
615,(Lawrence leaves.) 
616,DAWSON: If they had started searching those caves 
617,"QUINN: Well, they're not going to, are they, so we needn't worry. "
618, [Conference room]
619,
620, (The Doctor is in his normal clothes again.) 
621,DOCTOR: Anybody would think you were disappointed that I didn't get
622,lost. 
623,"LIZ: Come on, Doctor. You get everyone worried, then turn up safe and"
624,sound. 
625,"BAKER: You shouldn't have gone, sir. "
626,"DOCTOR: Well, it produced results, didn't it? "
627,BRIGADIER: Subterranean Loch Ness monster? Very helpful. 
628,"DOCTOR: Oh, so you don't believe me? "
629,"BRIGADIER: Oh, I believe you saw something. The question is what. "
630,LIZ: You weren't very specific. 
631,"DOCTOR: Well, I hardly had time to draw its picture, did I? All I can"
632,"tell you is that it was something very, very large, and something very,"
633,very alive. 
634,LIZ: Could it have been prehistoric? 
635,"DOCTOR: Well, it was certainly some kind of dinosaur. Certainly nothing"
636,"that I've ever seen before, though. "
637,"BAKER: In museums, you mean? "
638,"DOCTOR: No, I do not mean in museums. Well, on second thoughts,"
639,"perhaps, perhaps I do, yes. "
640,"BAKER: Look, sir. Suppose there is sabotage going on, and a large group"
641,hiding in the caves have faked up some kind of monster. 
642,LIZ: To scare people away? 
643,BAKER: And to account for the unexplained deaths. The noise the Doctor
644,heard could have been machinery. 
645,"BRIGADIER: What do you think, Doctor? "
646,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a possibility. I suppose. "
647,"BRIGADIER: Well, whatever it is, we must check up on it. "
648,BAKER: I'll be glad to go with you sir. 
649,"BRIGADIER: We'll all go, except Miss Shaw. "
650,"LIZ: Oh, just a minute. I'm not going to miss all the fun "
651,"BRIGADIER: No, Miss Shaw. "
652,LIZ: Have you never heard of female emancipation? 
653,"DOCTOR: Liz, this time I think he's right. "
654,"BAKER: Your men will be armed, sir? "
655,"BRIGADIER: Small arms, grenades, nothing very substantial. "
656,BAKER: We'll be a bit short on firepower. 
657,"DOCTOR: That's typical of the military mind, isn't it? Present them"
658,"with a new problem, and they start shooting at it. "
659,"BRIGADIER: Yes, well, I'll inform the Director of my decision. "
660,"DOCTOR: It's not the only way, you know, just blasting away at things! "
661,(The Brigadier leaves.) 
662,"BAKER: Oh don't worry, Doctor, we'll make sure your prehistoric friend"
663,gets a sporting chance. We won't shoot until we see the whites of its
664,"eyes, huh?"
665,
666, [Caves]
667,
668, (The Doctor leads the party.) 
669,DOCTOR: I found the footprint over here somewhere. 
670,(No dent in the gravel.) 
671,"BRIGADIER: Well, Doctor? "
672,"DOCTOR: Well it was here. Well, it's dried up, isn't it. Anyone can see"
673,that. 
674,BRIGADIER: I'm afraid I can't see anything at all. 
675,(A rumbling noise.) 
676,"BAKER: Listen! Shall I take a look, sir? "
677,"BRIGADIER: Yes all right. Captain Hawkins, take a couple of men and go"
678,with Major Baker. 
679,"HAWKINS: Very good sir. You two come with me. Major Baker! Come on, you"
680,"two. Wait for us, sir! "

687,"BAKER: Hey, you there! Halt or I fire! "
688,"(He shoots and it staggers out of sight. There is a roar, Baker turns"
689,and fires at the dinosaur before its claw crashes down on him. His
690,scream is heard down the tunnel. Then the three notes are played.) 
691,DOCTOR: Come on! 
692,"(Hawkins and the Doctor arrive at Baker's position first, followed by"
693,the Brigadier and the soldiers.) 
694,"BRIGADIER: What happened, Hawkins? "
695,"HAWKINS: No idea, sir. We found him like this when we got here. "
696,"DOCTOR: It's all right, old chap. Take it easy. Take it easy. "
697,BAKER: I saw someone down there. I fired over his head. I think I hit
698,him. Ricochet. 
699,BRIGADIER: Did he attack you? 
700,"BAKER: No, something else. Bullets, bullets wouldn't stop, stop it! "
701,"DOCTOR: It's all right, old chap. Take it easy. Hold him there. "
702,"BRIGADIER: Get the first aid kit, and a shot of morphine. We'd better"
703,get him back to the centre. 
704,"HAWKINS: Very good, sir. "
705,"BRIGADIER: Oh, Captain Hawkins? "
706,HAWKINS: Sir? 
707,"BRIGADIER: Before you do that, take a look up there and be careful. "
708,HAWKINS: Sir. 
709,"(Hawkins goes further up the tunnel, pistol drawn. The Doctor is"
710,"holding Baker's rifle, its barrel bent ninety degrees.) "
711,"BRIGADIER: What do you make of it, Doctor? "
712,"DOCTOR: Well, obviously Baker shot at something he thought was a man."
713,Then something else attacked Baker. 
714,BRIGADIER: The prehistoric creature that attacked you? 
715,"DOCTOR: Oh, it seems very likely, doesn't it. "
716,HAWKINS: Sir? Something over here sir. 
717,[Cavern]
718,
719," HAWKINS: Ricochet marks on the rocks, sir. And"
720,"look over here, sir. Traces of blood, spots leading this way. "
721,BRIGADIER: We'd better follow them. Doctor? 
722,DOCTOR: No. I'll get back to the hospital with these blood samples. In
723,any case I can give a hand to carry Baker. 
724,"BRIGADIER: Right. Morton, give the Doctor a hand. The rest, follow me. "
725,"DOCTOR: Brigadier! You'll be careful, won't you? After all, you don't"
726,"really know what you're following, you know. "
727,"(On Wenley Moor, as the sun sets, we see a three-fingered claw, then a"
728,scale-covered biped climbs out of the ground. We get a sample of its
729,vision which is binocular plus an upper red tinted triangular section.
730,"It staggers away, gasping, and hides in some scrubby bushes.)"

732, [Research Centre Laboratory]
733,
734, (The Doctor is examining the blood sample with a
735,microscope.) 
736,"LIZ: Well, Doctor? "
737,"DOCTOR: Well, see for yourself. "
738,"LIZ: Well, I know this may seem a little far-fetched, but there are"
739,resemblances to 
740,DOCTOR: Certain of the larger reptiles? 
741,LIZ: Yes. 
742,DOCTOR: Precisely. 
743,(The Brigadier enters.) 
744,"BRIGADIER: Bad news, Doctor. We lost it. "
745,"DOCTOR: Oh, no. "
746,"BRIGADIER: Well there's a lot of moorland out there. Anyway, it was"
747,getting dark. 
748,"DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose so. "
749,LIZ: What are you going to do now? 
750,BRIGADIER: I've sent to HQ for some more men. We'll mount a full-scale
751,"search in the morning. Doctor, have you got any idea what we're looking"
752,for? 
753,"DOCTOR: No, not yet. So far our tests have proved inconclusive. "
754,BRIGADIER: There'll be the devil to pay if Baker shot some innocent
755,"potholer. Oh, how is he, by the way? "
756,"LIZ: Well there was some bruising, and one arm was clawed, and there's"
757,a possibility of mild concussion. 
758,"DOCTOR: Poor chap. Mind you, he was behaving very irresponsibly,"
759,blazing away like that. 
760,"BRIGADIER: He was attacked, Doctor, just as you were. "
761,"DOCTOR: Yes, but not by the thing that he shot at. Seems to me,"
762,"Brigadier, that you're missing the most important point. "
763,BRIGADIER: Which is? 
764,"DOCTOR: That when Baker was attacked, and when I was attacked, the"
765,thing was called off before it could do any real harm. 
766,LIZ: Davis was killed though. 
767,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know, but in my opinion there are two kinds of creature"
768,"down in that cave. A large and ferocious one, and a smaller, much more"
769,"intelligent kind that controls the first, and may not be hostile. "
770,"BRIGADIER: It's a bit hard to accept one monster, let alone two. Still,"
771,"whatever it is, we'll know in the morning. "
772,DOCTOR: Yes and by that time it might be a little too late. 
773,"(Under cover of darkness, the injured reptile enters a farmyard, goes"
774,to a barn and falls into the bales of hay.)

781,considerable strain. 
782,LAWRENCE: So have we all. 
783,(The Doctor enters.) 
784,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'm so sorry. I was looking for Doctor Quinn. "
785,LAWRENCE: You're not the only one. 
786,"DAWSON: He completed as many of the tests as he could, and then he"
787,simply had to go and rest. 
788,DOCTOR: Is he in his quarters? 
789,"DAWSON: Well, no. "
790,"LAWRENCE: Gone off to that cottage of his, has he? If he spent more"
791,time doing his job and less writing that book of his. When he gets
792,"back, tell him I'd like to see him, would you? If he can spare a"
793,moment. 
794,(Lawrence leaves.) 
795,"DOCTOR: Don't worry, my dear. We're all under a bit of a strain at the"
796,moment. 
797,DAWSON: Doctor Quinn works harder than anyone at this centre. 
798,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes. Yes, I'm sure he does. It's just that I'd rather"
799,like another word with him myself. It's about those power losses.

804,way. Something scaly is watching him. He arrives at an area where one
805,part of the wall is smooth and stands still. A red light shines down on

807,smooth wall and walks through. A little way along the green walled
808,corridor another red light hits him. He raises his arms and walks
809,through into a room with alien control panels and leans back against a
810,"sort of chair, his hands on its projecting arms. The red light goes"
811,off.) 
812,SILURIAN : Why have you come? 
813,QUINN: I have come to warn you. There are men searching the caves.
814,Soldiers with weapons. 
815,SILURIAN : Your warning is too late. They have already attacked us.
816,
817,QUINN: What happened? 
818,SILURIAN : One of us was wounded. He was forced onto the surface. 
819,QUINN: Were any humans hurt? 
820,SILURIAN : That does not concern us. 
821,QUINN: You must stop taking power from the cyclotron. 
822,SILURIAN : We still need the power. We are not yet ready to make
823,our own. 
824,QUINN: It's causing endless trouble. That's what brought the soldiers
825,here. 
826,SILURIAN : One us of was wounded. We need your help to recover him.
827,
828,QUINN: How do you expect me to do that? The soldiers will be hunting
829,for him. They will see me. I tell you it's impossible. I won't do it. 
830,"SILURIAN : You refuse to help us, yet you expect our scientists to"
831,give you their secrets? 
832,"QUINN: All you've given me so far are scraps of knowledge, hints. I"
833,must know. 
834,SILURIAN : You will be given the information when the wounded one
835,is returned to us. 
836,QUINN: Very well. What shall I do? How can I find him? 
837,SILURIAN : We will give you a summoning device. He will hear it and
838,come to you.

850,SQUIRE: Get on to the police. Tell them there's something in my barn!

870,engaged in a full-scale military operation with my research centre as
871,it's HQ. 
872,"BRIGADIER: Yes, I apologise for the inconvenience, Director. "
873,"LAWRENCE: When you and your associates descended upon us, not I might"
874,"add at any request of mine, I understood that your purpose was to put"
875,an end to the setbacks that have been plaguing us here. 
876,"BRIGADIER: That is true, sir. "
877,LAWRENCE: And what have you achieved? 
878,"BRIGADIER: To begin with, Miss Shaw has discovered an abnormally high"
879,rate of stress symptoms amongst your staff. 
880,LAWRENCE: There's bound to be a few weak links. What about these power
881,losses? 
882,BRIGADIER: The Doctor has spent most of the night examining the
883,equipment here. 
884,"LAWRENCE: Ah yes, your mysterious Doctor with his sonic screwdriver. Is"
885,he qualified to make such an investigation? 
886,(The Doctor enters.) 
887,BRIGADIER: The Doctor's qualified to do almost everything. 
888,"DOCTOR: Well, that's it then. There's nothing wrong with it. "
889,BRIGADIER: Nothing wrong with what? 
890,"DOCTOR: With any of it. Cyclotron, remote control mechanisms, all of"
891,them functioning perfectly. 
892,LAWRENCE: You can't possibly be sure. 
893,"DOCTOR: My dear man, it's a perfectly simple piece of machinery. "
894,LAWRENCE: Oh? Then what is the explanation of these power losses?
895,Magic? 
896,"DOCTOR: The power from your reactor, like the mental state of your"
897,"staff, has been affected by some outside influence. "
898,LAWRENCE: Indeed. And what do you propose to do about it? 
899,DOCTOR: It's more a question of what you propose to do about it. Until
900,"this influence has been discovered and dealt with, this establishment"
901,should be closed down completely. 
902,LAWRENCE: Out of the question. It would mean a tremendous setback to
903,our research programme. 
904,DOCTOR: And to your career? 
905,"LAWRENCE: I'm extremely dissatisfied, Brigadier, with your conduct of"
906,"this investigation, and with the behaviour of your associate. I intend"
907,"to write to the Permanent Under-Secretary, and demand your recall. "
908,"BRIGADIER: That is your privilege, Director, but whilst we are here"
909,perhaps you'd let us carry on with our investigations. 
910,(Lawrence leaves.) 
911,"DOCTOR: Pompous idiot! Never could stand that man. Well, Brigadier, all"
912,"set to start playing soldiers, are we? "
913,(The Brigadier answers his phone.) 
914,BRIGADIER: Lethbridge-Stewart. Yes. Yes. I see. Thank you very much.
915,I'll be there as soon as I can. Police. I asked them to let me know of
916,any unusual occurrences. 
917,DOCTOR: And? 
918,BRIGADIER: Local farmer named Squire found dead in his barn. There were
919,claw marks on his body.
920,
921, [Squire's barn]
922,
923, DOCTOR: Poor chap. 
924,LIZ: Are they the same marks as you found on Davis in the caves? 
925,"DOCTOR: Oh no, these were made by something quite different. Smaller"
926,"perhaps, but very powerful. "
927,BRIGADIER: I thought you said the thing wasn't hostile. 
928,"DOCTOR: Yes, but I imagine that Squire attacked him with this."
929,(pitchfork) May have been cornered. What about the man's wife? 
930,BRIGADIER: She's at the local hospital suffering from shock. 
931,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I'd like a word with her. Perhaps you'd like to stay"
932,"and do some forensic tests, Liz. "
933,"LIZ: Yes, of course. "
934,"DOCTOR: Those claw marks. They weren't the cause of death, you know. "
935,BRIGADIER: Then what was? 
936,DOCTOR: Heart failure. You might say he died of fear.
937,
938, [Hospital ward]
939,
940," DOCTOR: Now please, I want you tell me. What"
941,happened to your husband? Can you remember what happened to him? 
942,"(Doris stares into the air, gasping with fear and whimpering.) "
943,"DOCTOR: She was found in the barn, paralysed with fear. She may have"
944,seen something. Have you got a pen? 
945,BRIGADIER: Yes. 
946,DOCTOR: And the chart please. Chart! 
947,(The Doctor starts scribbling over Doris' medical chart.) 
948,"DOCTOR: Now, I want you to take a look at this. Have you ever seen"
949,anything like this before. 
950,(The Doctor shows Doris his drawing of a reptile with three eyes.) 
951,DOCTOR: Yes? What? 
952,DORIS: Killed him! 
953,DOCTOR: Yes? 
954,DORIS: Killed him! 
955,DOCTOR: What happened then? Where did he go? 
956,DORIS: It's there. 
957,DOCTOR: Where? 
958,DORIS: In the barn. 
959,DOCTOR: In the barn? 
960,DORIS: In the barn. 
961,DOCTOR: Still there!

967,samples. The Silurian is up in the hay loft watching her. As she has

979,"QUINN: Oh, it's you. "
980,DAWSON: The front door was open. 
981,QUINN: What do you want? 
982,DAWSON: I wanted to know if you were all right. Doctor Lawrence has
983,been asking where you are. 
984,"QUINN: There are more important things than Doctor Lawrence. Ah, here"
985,we are. 
986,DAWSON: What are you doing? 
987,(Quinn unfolds the cave map.) 
988,QUINN: Yes. Look. 
989,(He puts the Silurian device on the table.) 
990,QUINN: They gave it to me. 
991,DAWSON: What on earth is it? 
992,QUINN: The product of another civilisation. It's a communications
993,device. 
994,DAWSON: You've seen them? 
995,"QUINN: No, but they trust me and they want me to help them. "
996,DAWSON: How? 
997,QUINN: That fool Baker wounded one of them. I have to get it back to
998,the caves. It will respond to this. 
999,DAWSON: That must have been what the soldiers were searching for. 
1000,QUINN: What? 
1001,DAWSON: The Doctor and the Brigadier rushed down to that farm near the
1002,research centre. 
1003,QUINN: Why? Do you know why? 
1004,DAWSON: Something happened there. Someone was hurt. 
1005,QUINN: Squire's Farm? There's a cave opening near there. Perhaps it?
1006,"Yes, it must have come up from the cave opening and made its way"
1007,"straight to the farm. Yes, that's it. That must be it. "
1008,DAWSON: What do I tell Doctor Lawrence? 
1009,QUINN: Tell him what you like.

1014,the door. The Brigadier looks through a crack in the wood to see Liz
1015,lying in the hay. Finally the door is open and they rush. The Doctor
1016,goes straight to Liz.) 
1017,BRIGADIER: Captain Hawkins! 
1018,HAWKINS: Sir! 
1019,"BRIGADIER: All right, Sergeant, search the place. "
1020,(Hawkins and a soldier go up into the hay loft as other soldiers spread
1021,out downstairs and an ambulance man goes to the Doctor and Liz. There
1022,"is a noise, but it is just a chicken. They go down again.) "
1023,"BRIGADIER: All right, panic over. There's nothing there. "
1024,"HAWKINS: It must be somewhere, sir. The door was bolted on the inside. "
1025,"DOCTOR: All right, officer. We can manage. "
1026,(A policeman leaves.) 
1027,BRIGADIER: What happened? 
1028,"DOCTOR: Well, give her a moment. She's just coming round. "
1029,(Liz pushes herself up to show the scrapes on her cheek.) 
1030,LIZ: I saw it. 
1031,"HAWKINS: Sir, over here. Look. "
1032,(There is a hole in the barn wall by a stack of hay bales.) 
1033,"BRIGADIER: I want the whole area searched. The fields, outbuildings,"
1034,everywhere. 
1035,"HAWKINS: Right, sir. "
1036,"DOCTOR: Now, Liz, this thing. What did it look like? "
1037,"LIZ: It was like a reptile, but it walked upright like a man. "
1038,"(In the pouring rain outside, Quinn drives in and parks his car next to"
1039,Bessie.) 
1040,"DOCTOR: Here you are, Liz. Come and sit on this. There we are. How are"
1041,you feeling now? 
1042,"LIZ: Better, thanks. Headache's a bit bad. "
1043,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm not surprised. "
1044,(Quinn enters.) 
1045,QUINN: Ah. What's happening? 
1046,DOCTOR: Doctor Quinn. How did you get here? 
1047,QUINN: I was on my way back to the research centre. I saw all the
1048,police and soldiers outside. 
1049,"DOCTOR: Ah, so you're feeling better then? "
1050,QUINN: Better? 
1051,DOCTOR: I understood you didn't feel too well. 
1052,"QUINN: Oh yes, yes. No, I went back to my cottage. I'm all right now. "
1053,DOCTOR: Whereabouts is your cottage? 
1054,"QUINN: By the lake, just north of the centre. What's happened to you?"
1055,Are you all right? 
1056,LIZ: Something attacked me. 
1057,QUINN: What sort of thing? 
1058,LIZ: Like a 
1059,"DOCTOR: Well, we don't know. Yet. "
1060,BRIGADIER: Everything's organised. The chopper's already up. 
1061,"QUINN: Well, I'd better get out of the way. Clearly you're all very"
1062,busy. 
1063,"BRIGADIER: Oh, one moment, Doctor Quinn. "
1064,QUINN: Yes? 
1065,BRIGADIER: Just a thought. Perhaps you could help us? You know this
1066,"district. If you wanted to hide, where would you go?"

1071,way through the heather. Captain Hawkins fires off a flare and watches

1082," (Liz, the Doctor, Quinn and the Brigadier are"
1083,studying a map.) 
1084,QUINN: I'm sorry I can't be more help. There's a lot of wild country
1085,around here. 
1086,"BRIGADIER: Well, thanks anyway. We'll cover the whole area. "
1087,"QUINN: Well, I really must be getting back to the centre. "
1088,DOCTOR: Doctor Quinn. I wonder whether you'd mind giving Miss Shaw a
1089,lift. 
1090,"QUINN: I'm sorry, I can't. "
1091,DOCTOR: But I thought you were going straight back there. 
1092,QUINN: I'm going to the garage in the village first. There's something
1093,wrong with my car. It might take some time. 
1094,BRIGADIER: Not to worry. I'll send her back in a police car. 
1095,"QUINN: Oh, I'll get along then. Excuse me. "
1096,(Quinn leaves.) 
1097,"BRIGADIER: Yes, well, I'll get that laid on. "
1098,(The Brigadier leaves.) 
1099,"LIZ: Doctor, look at the map. "
1100,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
1101,"LIZ: Doctor Quinn's cottage is here, and the village is here. "

1106,
1107, (Quinn drives along a track then stops and gets
1108,out of his car. He walks a little way then switches on the Silurian
1109,device. It makes the same three tone noise we heard call off the
1110,dinosaur. A police dog hears it and starts barking. The UNIT helicopter
1111,"flies low along the track. Quinn notices it and turns the device off,"
1112,putting it in his pocket. He waves at the helicopter as it flies past
1113,then goes back to his car.)

1118,and out. 
1119,"BRIGADIER: Any luck, Captain? "
1120,"HAWKINS: Oh, I'm not quite sure, sir. The helicopter reports seeing a"
1121,"man standing by his car in the north west sector of area two, sir. "
1122,BRIGADIER: Well? 
1123,"HAWKINS: Well, apparently he just waved and drove off. "
1124,BRIGADIER: Probably another potholer. 
1125,HAWKINS: Yes sir. But there is something else. 
1126,BRIGADIER: Yes? 
1127,"HAWKINS: Well, a moment ago I thought I heard a funny kind of a noise,"
1128,sir. 
1129,"BRIGADIER: Well, what kind of noise? "
1130,"HAWKINS: Rather like that sound we heard in the cave, sir. "
1131,DOCTOR: Hmm. What direction did it come from? 
1132,"HAWKINS: Well, that also came from the north west sector of area two,"
1133,sir. 
1134,"(The Doctor and Brigadier drive away. On another track, Quinn has the"
1135,device signalling before he parks up by a small clump of young fir
1136,trees. The signal is very fast now. The Silurian approaches and the
1137,signal is so fast it is almost one sound. Quinn turns and sees it. On
1138,"another road, the Doctor stops Bessie.) "
1139,BRIGADIER: That noise. It stopped. 
1140,DOCTOR: Yes. I'm sure it came from over there. Let's go and have a
1141,look. 
1142,(Everyone is closing in on the place where Quinn parked.) 
1143,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, stop! "
1144,(The Doctor stops Bessie and the Brigadier gets out to look at
1145,three-toed tracks in the mud.) 
1146,BRIGADIER: Look at these. Are these the same as the footprints as you
1147,saw in the cave? 
1148,"DOCTOR: No, this is smaller. These are the footprints of a biped. "
1149,BRIGADIER: Then the thing can't be far from here. 
1150,"DOCTOR: Here, look at these. "
1151,BRIGADIER: Car tracks. 
1152,DOCTOR: Anyone bringing a car here would be miles out of his way.

1168,"LIZ: Yes, he asked me to come and see you. "
1169,BAKER: And? 
1170,LIZ: You're to stay here till you're better. How's the arm? 
1171,"BAKER: Oh, it's perfectly all right. Look, I have got to get out of"
1172,here. 
1173,LIZ: Just as soon as Doctor Meredith says so. There's still a chance
1174,you may have concussion. 
1175,"BAKER: Oh, rubbish. "
1176,LIZ: How much do you remember of what happened to you? 
1177,BAKER: Everything! I saw this man. He must have been a saboteur. I took

1179,isn't the Brigadier taking any action? 
1180,"LIZ: I'm sure he is. Just leave it to him. Look, I must go. "

1192,DOCTOR: I thought you were going straight back to the research centre. 
1193,"QUINN: Yes, yes, I am. "
1194,DOCTOR: Only I saw your car was still parked outside. I thought perhaps
1195,you might have been taken ill again. 
1196,"QUINN: No, no, I'm perfectly all right, thank you. I just had to come"
1197,"back for something, that's all "

1199,enters.) 
1200,"DOCTOR: What a charming place. Mmm, charming. Lovely old grandfather"

1202,"place long, have you? "
1203,"QUINN: No, I bought it a few months after I got the job here. Look"
1204,"Doctor, I'm sorry but I really have to be "
1205,"DOCTOR: Centrally heated too, eh? "
1206,QUINN: It gets very cold up here. 
1207,"DOCTOR: Yes. Still, you do keep it very warm though, don't you? "
1208,"QUINN: Yes, well, the thermostat's jammed, you see. I'm having it"
1209,fixed. 
1210,"DOCTOR: Perhaps you'd like me to look at it for you, I like tinkering"
1211,with these gadgets. 
1212,QUINN: That's very kind of you but I've already sent for the people who
1213,installed it. 
1214,"DOCTOR: Good, good. Only it is rather like the reptile house in the"
1215,"zoo, isn't it? "
1216,QUINN: What do you mean? Eh? What do you mean? 
1217,DOCTOR: Nothing. I was just referring to the temperature of the room. 
1218,"QUINN: Doctor, I'm sorry but I really must ask you to leave. There's"
1219,something very urgent I have to do before I go back to the centre. 
1220,"DOCTOR: Oh? Yes, yes, of course. I'm so sorry to have taken up so much"
1221,of your time. 
1222,QUINN: Not at all. I'm only sorry that I seem to have been rather 
1223,"DOCTOR: My word, it's just as hot out here, isn't it? You really must"
1224,"get that thermostat fixed, you know. Anything wrong? "
1225,"QUINN: Er, no. "
1226,DOCTOR: You'd save yourself a lot of trouble if you'd let me help you.

1237,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
1238,LIZ: What do you think you're doing? 
1239,"DOCTOR: Breaking open the cabinet, m'dear. He's not going to leave"
1240,"anything important just lying around, is he? There we are. Now then,"
1241,"what have we got here? Pitons, notes. What's this? Let's have a look at"
1242,these. 
1243,"(The Doctor takes out a blue and brown ball, and a file.) "
1244,LIZ: What's that? 
1245,DOCTOR: Some kind of a ball. It's got some markings on it. Have a look.
1246,
1247,LIZ: It's a globe. Surely that's the shape of the west coast of
1248,"America. No. No, the land mass is all bunched together "
1249,DOCTOR: What's that? Let me have a look at that. Of course. This is the
1250,"world as it was before the great continental drift, two hundred million"
1251,"years ago. And these notes, well, they're calculations on the age of"
1252,"the earth, with particular reference to the Silurian era. "
1253,DAWSON: What are you doing in here? This is Doctor Quinn's private
1254,office! I shall have to inform the Director about this. 
1255,"DOCTOR: That won't help Doctor Quinn, will it? "
1256,DAWSON: What are you talking about? 
1257,"DOCTOR: I'm talking about the caves, Miss Dawson. "
1258,DAWSON: What about them? 
1259,"DOCTOR: There's something down there, and I think Doctor Quinn knows"
1260,"what it is. Now look, you must tell me what you know, Miss Dawson,"
1261,before anybody else gets killed. Maybe even Doctor Quinn. 
1262,"DAWSON: Oh, I warned him. "
1263,DOCTOR: Warned him? Warned him about what? 
1264,"DAWSON: I promised not to tell anyone, but if Doctor Quinn is in"
1265,"danger, I "
1266,"BRIGADIER: Ah Doctor, we're due for a meeting with "
1267,"DOCTOR: Yes, Miss Dawson? "
1268,"DAWSON: I'm sorry, Doctor, I can't help you. If you'll excuse me. "

1274,
1275, (Quinn is bringing in a bucket of firewood when
1276,the doorbell rings. Quinn waits in the darkened living room as someone

1278,DAWSON: Oh! 
1279,QUINN: What do you want? 
1280,"DAWSON: That Doctor, the one with UNIT, I caught him searching your"
1281,office. 
1282,QUINN: He had no right. 
1283,DAWSON: You can't go on like this. Don't you realise? People are being
1284,"killed, and it's your fault. You've got to tell someone. "
1285,QUINN: No. Not until I'm ready. 
1286,"DAWSON: Oh John, please. Please, let me tell this Doctor. He'll believe"
1287,you. He wants to help you. 
1288,"QUINN: He's a scientist, too. He only wants to steal the credit for my"
1289,discoveries. 
1290,DAWSON: What discoveries? They haven't told you anything yet. 
1291,QUINN: They will now. I can make them. 
1292,DAWSON: You can't make them do anything. 
1293,QUINN: I've got one of them here. The one they were hunting. I've got
1294,it locked up. 
1295,DAWSON: But it might kill you. It's already killed that farmer. 
1296,QUINN: That creature in there is a scientist. With the knowledge it can
1297,"give me, I can prove "
1298,DAWSON: It won't give you anything! 
1299,QUINN: Unless I get it back to the caves it will die. And I won't take
1300,it back until it tells me what I want to know.

1302,
1303," DOCTOR: Look, I tell you, gentlemen, that the"
1304,interference is definitely coming from those caves! 
1305,"BAKER: (entering) Exactly, Doctor. This centre is being sabotaged. "
1306,"BRIGADIER: Major Baker, you are supposed to be in the Sickbay. "
1307,"BAKER: I am perfectly all right, thank you. I propose that we move down"
1308,"there in force, sir. "
1309,"DOCTOR: That, Major Baker, is precisely what we must not do at this"
1310,present time. 
1311,BAKER: I insist that you take some positive action. 
1312,"BRIGADIER: I shall decide what action I shall take, and you, Major"
1313,"Baker, will return to the Sickbay and remain there till I send for you."
1314,
1315,"BAKER: Oh, this is ridiculous! "
1316,"BRIGADIER: And that will be all, Major Baker. Captain Hawkins, you will"
1317,accompany Major Baker to the Sickbay and see that he remains there. 
1318,HAWKINS: Sir! 
1319,(Baker and Hawkins leave.) 
1320,LAWRENCE: Do I now take it you have arrested my security officer? 
1321,BRIGADIER: Major Baker isn't himself. 
1322,"DOCTOR: I must say, Brigadier, that I'm delighted that you didn't agree"
1323,with him. 
1324,BRIGADIER: Oh but I do. I intend to send for more men and mount a full
1325,scale search of those caves. 
1326,DOCTOR: Now look if you'd just give me a little more time 
1327,"BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, Doctor. My mind is made up. "
1328,LAWRENCE: I advise you to do your best to achieve some kind of results
1329,in the time available to you. 
1330,BRIGADIER: Sir? 
1331,"LAWRENCE: Masters, the Permanent Under-Secretary, is coming down here"
1332,to conduct a personal investigation. Unless you can impress him more
1333,"than you impress me, you may well find yourself transferred to some"
1334,"simpler duties, more within your scope. "
1335,"BRIGADIER: Doctor Lawrence, as I believe I have told you before "
1336,(Lawrence and the Brigadier leave.) 
1337,"DOCTOR: Stupid bumbling idiots, the pair of them. "
1338,LIZ: Now where are you going? 
1339,DOCTOR: To see Doctor Quinn. I must persuade him to trust me before
1340,it's too late.
1341,
1342, [Quinn's cottage]
1343,
1344, (Once again the doorbell rings through the dark
1345,rooms. The Doctor shines his torch through the window then opens the
1346,door.) 
1347,DOCTOR: Doctor Quinn? Doctor Quinn? 
1348,(The Doctor enters the hallway. A Silurian hand is on a half door
1349,behind him as he enters the living room where he sees Quinn in an easy
1350,chair.) 
1351,DOCTOR: Doctor Quinn? Quinn? 
1352,(Quinn's eyes are open but he does not respond when the Doctor waves
1353,"his hand in front of them, so the Doctor checks for a heartbeat then"
1354,stands and closes Quinn's eyes. The Doctor takes the Silurian device
1355,from Quinn's cold hand and switches it on. The Silurian enters.) 
1356, Episode Four
1357,
1358, [Quinn's cottage] 
1359, DOCTOR: Hello! Are you a Silurian? 
1360,"(The Doctor holds out his hand and the Silurian gazes at it,"
1361,withdrawing its claw.) 
1362,"DOCTOR: Look, do you understand me? (a nod) Well, what do your people"
1363,want? How can we help you? How many are there of you? Tell us what we
1364,can do! 
1365,"(At the sound of a car outside, the Silurian pushes the Doctor aside"
1366,and bursts through the back door into the night.) 
1367,"DOCTOR: No, wait! Wait! Wait! Unless you Silurians tell us what you"
1368,"want, the humans will destroy you!"
1369,
1370, [Sickbay]
1371,
1372,"(Baker is lying on the bed, making notes from a map"
1373,"of the caves. He sees a soldier walk past, and hides the map under his"
1374,pillow and the notebook in his jacket pocket.) 
1375,BAKER: Sergeant. 
1376,HART: Sir. 
1377,BAKER: Are you still standing guard over me? 
1378,"HART: Sorry, sir. Brigadier's orders. "
1379,"BAKER: I see. Well, as long as you're here, you may as well give me a"
1380,hand. Would you help me off with my jacket? My arm's still a bit stiff.
1381,
1382,"HART: Certainly, sir. "
1383,"BAKER: Oh steady, now, steady. It's still a bit painful. "
1384,"HART: Yes, of course, sir. "
1385,BAKER: Thank you. 
1386,(Hart takes the jacket and turns. Baker chops him across the back of
1387,"the neck, grabs his jacket back and runs.) "
1388, [Conference room]
1389,
1390, BRIGADIER: And you just let him walk away? 
1391,"HART: Yes, sir. "
1392,"BRIGADIER: Sergeant Hart, you were told to see that Major Baker"
1393,remained in the Sickbay. 
1394,"HART: I know, sir, but he jumped me. "
1395,BRIGADIER: You should have been prepared for that. 
1396,"HART: But I thought he was ill, sir. He said he couldn't use his arm. "
1397,BRIGADIER: He seems to have used it on you all right. 
1398,"HART: Yes, sir. Do you want me to set up a search party, sir? "
1399,BRIGADIER: No. Dismissed. 
1400,HART: Sir! 
1401,(Hart leaves.) 
1402,LIZ: Surely you're going to look for Major Baker? 
1403,"BRIGADIER: He'll be in those caves, looking for those saboteurs of his."
1404,We'll find him when we move in. 
1405,"(He is right, of course. Baker is using his notes to find his way"
1406,"through. He steps through a tunnel into a puddle of bubbling liquid,"
1407,and cannot move his feet. Silurians appear behind him. Baker turns and
1408,"tries to fire his rifle at them, but they easily hide behind"
1409,stalagmites. Finally one gets up close. He throws his rifle at it as
1410,the third eye glows red and he collapses.) 
1411,LIZ: You're still going ahead with your plans to invade the caves?
1412,Whatever the Doctor says? 
1413,BRIGADIER: I've sent to HQ for reinforcements. They should be here by
1414,"dawn. Look, where is the Doctor? "
1415,LIZ: I'm not quite sure. I believe he mentioned visiting Doctor Quinn. 
1416,BRIGADIER: I didn't bring him down here to visit the sick. 
1417,(The Doctor enters.) 
1418,LIZ: Hello. 
1419,DOCTOR: Hello. 
1420,LIZ: Was Quinn any help? 
1421,"DOCTOR: No. No, I'm afraid not. "
1422,BRIGADIER: What's Doctor Quinn got to do with it? 
1423,"DOCTOR: He was, is very interested in potholing, I thought his"
1424,experience with the caves might have been useful. 
1425,"BRIGADIER: May I remind you, Doctor, that your business here is to"
1426,"investigate these power failures. Now, do you have any suggestions to"
1427,make? 
1428,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. That this establishment should be closed down"
1429,completely. 
1430,BRIGADIER: Not much chance of Doctor Lawrence agreeing to that. 
1431,"DOCTOR: And a planned, cautious, scientific investigation of those"
1432,caves. Not an invasion by a lot of big-booted soldiers. 
1433,"BRIGADIER: There are times, Doctor, when you sorely try my patience. "
1434,(The Brigadier and the other UNIT personnel leave.) 
1435,"LIZ: What's wrong, Doctor? What happened when you saw Quinn? "
1436,"DOCTOR: Sit down, Liz. Quinn's dead. He's been killed. "
1437,"LIZ: Oh, no. "
1438,DOCTOR: By a Silurian. 
1439,LIZ: A Silurian? 
1440,DOCTOR: Probably the same creature that attacked you. 
1441,LIZ: You saw it? 
1442,DOCTOR: I spoke to it. And it understood me. 
1443,LIZ: What was it like? 
1444,DOCTOR: Reptilian. Biped. A completely alien species. 
1445,LIZ: And it didn't attack you? 
1446,"DOCTOR: Liz, these creatures aren't just animals. They're an alien life"
1447,"form, as intelligent as we are. "
1448,LIZ: Why didn't you tell the Brigadier? 
1449,DOCTOR: Because I want to find out more about these creatures. They're
1450,not necessarily hostile. 
1451,"LIZ: Doctor, it attacked me. "
1452,"DOCTOR: Yes, but only to escape. It didn't kill you. It didn't attack"
1453,"me when I was in Quinn's cottage. Well, don't you see? They only attack"
1454,"for survival. Well, human beings behave in very much the same way. "
1455,LIZ: What are we going to do now? 
1456,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm going back down into those caves, see what I can find"
1457,out. 
1458,LIZ: Then I'm coming with you. 
1459,"DOCTOR: No, Liz. "
1460,LIZ: Either I come with you or I go straight to the Brigadier. 
1461,DOCTOR: All right. Have it your own way. But the fate be on your own
1462,"head. Here, you take a look at this. "
1463,LIZ: What is it? 
1464,DOCTOR: It's a map of the caves that I found in Quinn's office. And
1465,look here. He's marked a special route to somewhere.
1466,
1467, [Caves]
1468,
1469," DOCTOR: I think this is right. Hang on a minute,"
1470,I'm not so sure. 
1471,"LIZ: Well, what about this way, then? "
1472,"DOCTOR: No, Quinn's marked a completely different route, look. "
1473,"LIZ: Yes, but look, that's far more direct. "
1474,"DOCTOR: Yes, all right. Here, wait a minute. "
1475,(The Doctor stops before the pool of liquid and picks up a shell
1476,casing.) 
1477,"DOCTOR: Look at that. A cartridge. Just been fired, too. "
1478,"LIZ: Hey, look. "
1479,(Liz picks up a notebook.) 
1480,"DOCTOR: Well, that's Baker's. "
1481,LIZ: We've got to find him. 
1482,"DOCTOR: Liz, wait a minute. "
1483,"(The Doctor picks up a rock and drops it into the liquid, which starts"
1484,bubbling.) 
1485,"LIZ: Oh, no. "
1486,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, from now on I think we'd better stick rigidly to"
1487,Quinn's route. 
1488,LIZ: Yes. 
1489,DOCTOR: Come on. 
1490,(Liz gasps.) 
1491,DOCTOR: What's the matter? 
1492,LIZ: It's this heat. 
1493,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know. It's very odd. "
1494,(Further on they come to the smooth wall.) 
1495,"LIZ: Doctor, look! "
1496,"DOCTOR: Well, well, well. "
1497,LIZ: It's a doorway. 
1498,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, anyone can see that. The question is, how do you"
1499,open it? 
1500,LIZ: Doctor. A Silurian. 
1501,(The Doctor and Liz hide as the figure approaches the door. A few
1502,familiar beeps and the door opens and it goes through. The door shuts
1503,again.) 
1504,DOCTOR: I can't understand why it didn't see us. 
1505,(Liz touches the door.) 
1506,LIZ: Ow! 
1507,DOCTOR: What's the matter? 
1508,LIZ: Why is it so hot? 
1509,"DOCTOR: Well, the Silurians are reptilian, you see. They've presumably"
1510,created an environment inside there that suits them. 
1511,LIZ: I wonder how many of them there are. 
1512,"DOCTOR: Well, I wish I knew. There's only one way of finding out,"
1513,that's to get in there and see. 
1514,"LIZ: Well, we can't without one of those things it was carrying. "
1515,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. "
1516,LIZ: I suppose you just happen to have one in your pocket? 
1517,DOCTOR: As a matter of fact I have. Quinn's. 
1518,(The Doctor activates the Silurian device and the door opens for them.)
1519,
1520, [Silurian cages]
1521,
1522, (Just inside the base they hide as a Silurian
1523,comes out of a room and goes along the corridor. They sneak past the
1524,"opening, unnoticed by the Silurian sitting at a control panel. A little"
1525,further on is a metal cage with one annoyed inhabitant.) 
1526,BAKER: How long are you leaving me in here? They'll be coming after me
1527,you know. 
1528,(His Silurian guard goes back up the corridor to the room. The Doctor
1529,and Liz approach from the rear of the cage.) 
1530,DOCTOR: (sotto) Baker! 
1531,BAKER: How did you get in here? Where are the troops? 
1532,"DOCTOR: I'm sorry, but we're alone. "
1533,"BAKER: Well, you've got to get back. Tell the Brigadier. "
1534,LIZ: Can't we get you out of here? 
1535,"BAKER: No, there's not a chance. There's some sort of electronic lock. "
1536,DOCTOR: Have they harmed you at all? 
1537,"BAKER: No, they just keep asking a lot of questions. "
1538,DOCTOR: They can talk to you? 
1539,BAKER: Yes. 
1540,DOCTOR: What do they ask? 
1541,"BAKER: The population of the earth, what weapons we use, what food we"
1542,eat. Don't you see? They are trying to gather information for an
1543,invasion! 
1544,"DOCTOR: Look, if they speak to you again, co-operate with them a"
1545,little. Find out all you can about them. 
1546,(Liz hears a mechanical noise.) 
1547,LIZ: What's that? 
1548,"(In the next compartment, a casket opens and a Silurian slowly gets"
1549,out.) 
1550,LIZ: What are they doing? 
1551,DOCTOR: They're trying to revive a Silurian from some sort of deep
1552,hibernation. Maybe that explains the power losses in the research
1553,centre. 
1554,"BAKER: (sotto) Doctor! Look, this is your chance. Get moving. "
1555,LIZ: We can't just leave you here. 
1556,"BAKER: Go on, get out of here, will you, or we'll all be their"
1557,prisoners. 
1558,"DOCTOR: All right, we'll get back for you as soon as we possibly can. "
1559,BAKER: Fine. 
1560,DOCTOR: Good luck. 
1561,(The Doctor and Liz go back down the corridor and stop by the room.) 
1562,LIZ: There's three of them in there now. One of them's bound to see us.
1563,
1564,(They return to the cage and Baker points at another corridor.) 
1565,BAKER: Try. 
1566,DOCTOR: Let's try this way. 
1567,(They go down another corridor. Liz gasps in horror as they pass a room
1568,with a transparent door.) 
1569,DOCTOR: That's the creature that attacked me in the caves! They must
1570,turn it loose sometimes and use it as some kind of a watchdog. 
1571,LIZ: Those creatures died out millions of years ago. 
1572,"DOCTOR: Apparently not, Liz."
1573,
1574, [Cyclotron control room]
1575,
1576,(The cyclotron is glowing deep red again.) 
1577,TRAVIS: Close down sector three. 
1578,TECH 1 : Sector three closed down. 
1579,TRAVIS: Electron voltage reading. 
1580,TECH 1 : Two thousand million. Falling. 
1581,TRAVIS: Close down sector four. 
1582,TECH 2 : Sector four closed down. 
1583,TRAVIS: Stabilise all sectors. Maintain close down. 
1584,TECH 3 : All sectors stabilised. 
1585,(Lawrence rushes in.) 
1586,"LAWRENCE: What is it, Travis? "
1587,"TRAVIS: Another power loss, sir. We were making the hourly circuit"
1588,check when it registered. 
1589,LAWRENCE: Have you stabilised the nuclear reaction? 
1590,"TRAVIS: Yes, sir. We shut down at once. "
1591,(Lawrence picks up the phone.) 
1592,LAWRENCE: Lawrence here. Get me the generating area. 
1593,"TRAVIS: I've already checked, sir. Nothing wrong there. "
1594,"LAWRENCE: I see. All right, forget it. Get me Doctor Quinn at his home."
1595,
1596,"TRAVIS: I've tried that, sir. There's no reply. "
1597,LAWRENCE: Cancel the call. Where's Miss Dawson? Isn't this her shift? 
1598,"TRAVIS: She didn't report in, sir. And there's no reply from her"
1599,quarters. 
1600,"LAWRENCE: Oh, this is absurd! "
1601,(The phone rings. Travis gets there first.) 
1602,"TRAVIS: Excuse me, sir. Travis. Yes, he's here. All right, I'll tell"
1603,"him. The Permanent Under-Secretary, sir. "
1604,"LAWRENCE: What are you doing, man? Let me speak to him. "
1605,"TRAVIS: There's no need, sir. I meant he's actually here in the centre."
1606,He's on his way down in the lift now. 
1607,LAWRENCE: That's all I need. 
1608,"TRAVIS: What's he come here for, sir? "
1609,LAWRENCE: I sent for him! 
1610,(Geoffrey Palmer
1611,enters.) 
1612,"MASTERS: Hello, Charles. "
1613,"LAWRENCE: Oh, Edward. "
1614,MASTERS: What's all this about? 
1615,LAWRENCE: I didn't expect to see you till much later. 
1616,MASTERS: I've got to report to a meeting in London tomorrow. Any chance
1617,of some coffee? 
1618,LAWRENCE: Coffee? 
1619,MASTERS: I have been travelling most of the night. 
1620,"LAWRENCE: Oh yes, of course, I'm sorry. Let's go to my conference room."
1621,It's this way.
1622, [Conference room]
1623,
1624, MASTERS: UNIT? 
1625,"LAWRENCE: As you can see, they're well established. "
1626,(Masters heads straight for the coffee machine.) 
1627,MASTERS: Lethbridge-Stewart is asking for more troops. 
1628,"LAWRENCE: Yeah, to go chasing about on some sort of man hunt. Nothing's"
1629,been done about the power failures. 
1630,"MASTERS: We've got to get this sorted out, you know. I'm under very"
1631,heavy pressure from the Minister. The future of this centre is very
1632,much in question. 
1633,"LAWRENCE: Ah, but surely "
1634,"MASTERS: You've made great promises for this project, Charles. Nuclear"
1635,"power into electricity. Limitless supplies of cheap, safe energy. "
1636,"LAWRENCE: And we can do it, too. "
1637,MASTERS: Millions of pounds have been poured into this place with no
1638,results to show for it. 
1639,"LAWRENCE: But if this research centre is abandoned, all of that money"
1640,will be wasted. 
1641,"MASTERS: It would mean the end of your career, Charles. That's why I'm"
1642,doing my best for you. What does your security man have to say about
1643,all this? 
1644,LAWRENCE: Major Baker is convinced there are saboteurs in the caves. 
1645,MASTERS: And are there? 
1646,"LAWRENCE: Well, of course not. "
1647,MASTERS: How can you be so sure? 
1648,"LAWRENCE: Well, the whole thing's ridiculous. The Brigadier and Baker"
1649,"talk of saboteurs, and that Doctor believes there are monsters down"
1650,there. 
1651,MASTERS: I beg your pardon? 
1652,LAWRENCE: Didn't the Brigadier put that in his report? 
1653,MASTERS: He was a little vague about the precise nature of the menace. 
1654,"LAWRENCE: That's scarcely surprising. Look, Edward, I admit we've had a"
1655,"number of technical setbacks. Mine is not an easy job, you know. "
1656,MASTERS: I realise that. 
1657,"LAWRENCE: Our problems can only be solved by scientists, not by"
1658,security men. 
1659,MASTERS: What do you want me to do. 
1660,LAWRENCE: Get all these UNIT people out of my way. Let me get on with
1661,my job. 
1662,MASTERS: The Brigadier is only trying to help you. 
1663,LAWRENCE: Help me? He's exaggerating this whole business out of all
1664,proportion merely to magnify his own importance. 
1665,MASTERS: I hardly think that's justified. 
1666,LAWRENCE: Well you don't know him as well as I do. I 
1667,"MASTERS: I'm not arguing with you, man. I'm simply trying to find a"
1668,solution to the problem. The Brigadier and his team have come down here
1669,with 
1670,"LAWRENCE: His team? What, that girl and that crazy Doctor? "
1671,"MASTERS: The Doctor is supposed to be brilliant, in his own way. He may"
1672,be a little eccentric. 
1673,"LAWRENCE: The man's a raving lunatic! He's insolent, he's impertinent,"
1674,he shows no respect for my authority. 
1675,(The Doctor and Liz enter.) 
1676,"DOCTOR: Ah, Doctor Lawrence. Just the man I wanted to see. Now tell me,"
1677,have you just had a power failure? 
1678,LAWRENCE: Yes. How did you know? 
1679,"DOCTOR: I see, thank you. "
1680,LAWRENCE: Now just a minute. This is the Permanent Under-Secretary. 
1681,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I've got no time to chat to under-secretaries,"
1682,permanent or otherwise. I must find the Brigadier. 
1683,MASTERS: May I ask who you are? 
1684,DOCTOR: You may ask. 
1685,(The Brigadier enters.) 
1686,"DOCTOR: Ah, there you are. "
1687,BRIGADIER: I've only just heard that you were here. I've been trying to
1688,"get in touch with you. Look, sir, what's happening about my"
1689,reinforcements? 
1690,MASTERS: That's one of the reasons why I'm here. I'm afraid you're not
1691,going to get any reinforcements. 
1692,BRIGADIER: May I ask why not? 
1693,MASTERS: I can't go to the Minister of Defence and request regular Army
1694,support for you on the basis of a wild tale about monsters in caves. 
1695,"BRIGADIER: Sir, we have overwhelming evidence that there is something"
1696,in those caves. 
1697,MASTERS: Do you mean saboteurs? 
1698,"BRIGADIER: I don't know, but the caves are vast. To cover them properly"
1699,I must have more men! 
1700,"MASTERS: I'm sorry, that's out of the question. "
1701,BRIGADIER: Then I'll have to go in with the troops I have. 
1702,"DOCTOR: Brigadier, you are not to take your men into those caves. I've"
1703,been down there and I know what's happening. 
1704,"MASTERS: Well, if you do, perhaps you'd be good enough to tell us. "
1705,"BRIGADIER: Yes, Doctor. I think you'd better."
1706,
1707, [Silurian cages]
1708,
1709, (Two Silurians are interrogating Baker. The first
1710,"is old and experienced, the second young and impulsive.) "
1711,SILURIAN: You must answer our questions. 
1712,"BAKER: I am not refusing, am I? "
1713,SILURIAN: Is your species the only intelligent lifeform? 
1714,"BAKER: Only intelligent lifeform? Oh, I see what you mean. Yes, of"
1715,course we are. 
1716,SILURIAN JR: You were carrying a simple projectile weapon. Do all your
1717,species carry these weapons? 
1718,BAKER: Of course not. Only soldiers. 
1719,SILURIAN JR: What other weapons do your soldiers carry? 
1720,BAKER: I refuse to answer that sort of question. 
1721,SILURIAN: You must answer. 
1722,"BAKER: You can do what you like, I will not tell you anything. I will"
1723,not tell you anything! 
1724,SILURIAN: The creature is becoming aggressive again. 
1725,SILURIAN JR: I will force it to answer. 
1726,(The Silurian pulls back Junior's claw.) 
1727,SILURIAN: I do not wish it to be damaged. This creature is less
1728,intelligent. Quinn should not have been killed. 
1729,SILURIAN JR: But he tried to keep one of us prisoner. 
1730,SILURIAN: This strange species has developed some kind of civilisation.
1731,We need to study it. 
1732,SILURIAN JR: The species is dangerous and hostile. We should kill them
1733,all. 
1734, [Conference room]
1735,
1736, LAWRENCE: And are you suggesting that these
1737,Silurians are responsible for the power losses? 
1738,LIZ: Some of them are still in hibernation. The others use the power to
1739,bring them back to life. 
1740,BRIGADIER: What weapons do they have? 
1741,DOCTOR: Huh. Spoken like a true soldier. 
1742,"BRIGADIER: It is my job, Doctor. How many are there? "
1743,"DOCTOR: Well, we don't know. Maybe there are thousands. "
1744,"LAWRENCE: Then you must deal with them promptly, Brigadier. If they"
1745,exist. 
1746,"DOCTOR: Look, Mister Under-Secretary, surely this is a government"
1747,matter. It cannot be decided at this level. 
1748,"MASTERS: Doctor, whether I believe you or not, I can't go back to the"
1749,Minister with a story like this. There's no proof except your word. 
1750,"BRIGADIER: I'll find all the proof you need. Look, Doctor, I'm not"
1751,"going down there to start a war, but I must know what's going on. "
1752,DOCTOR: If you go down there with a party of armed men there's bound to
1753,be fighting. 
1754,"LAWRENCE: What is your alternative, Doctor? "
1755,"DOCTOR: Well, leave them alone. Let me try and make contact with them. "
1756,MASTERS: Are you really convinced these Silurians aren't savage? 
1757,"DOCTOR: Well, so far they've only attacked in self-defence. At least"
1758,let's give them the benefit of the doubt. 
1759,"(Dawson enters slowly, in her raincoat.) "
1760,"LAWRENCE: Miss Dawson, where on earth have you been? What's the matter?"
1761,
1762,"DAWSON: Doctor Quinn, he's dead. "
1763,LAWRENCE: Dead? 
1764,DAWSON: He didn't answer his phone. I went there and found him. The
1765,Silurians killed him. 
1766,BRIGADIER: What do you know about these creatures? 
1767,DAWSON: Doctor Quinn found out about them when he was potholing. He
1768,said they had great scientific knowledge. He co-operated with them and
1769,they killed him. 
1770,"BRIGADIER: Now, Doctor, do you still maintain these creatures aren't"
1771,hostile? I'll continue as planned. 
1772,MASTERS: I think you're right. 
1773,"BRIGADIER: We'll move in first thing in the morning. Oh, Miss Dawson?"
1774,"I'd like a full statement from you, everything you know about this"
1775,"business. Will you come with me, please? "
1776,"DOCTOR: Miss Dawson, did these Silurians tell Doctor Quinn anything"
1777,about their intentions? 
1778,"DAWSON: Intentions? Well, that's obvious, isn't it? We must destroy"
1779,"them, before they destroy us. "
1780,(The Brigadier and Dawson leave.) 
1781,"MASTERS: Charles, we'd better have a word. "
1782,(Masters and Lawrence go to the other end of the room.) 
1783,LIZ: Now what are you going to do? 
1784,DOCTOR: There's only one thing I can do. I've got to get down into
1785,those caves and warn the Silurians. 
1786,LIZ: What? 
1787,"DOCTOR: If the Brigadier won't listen to reason, Liz, maybe the"
1788,Silurians will. 
1789,LIZ: Please be careful.

1794,this. 
1795,SILURIAN JR: How did you enter our base? 
1796,SILURIAN: Why have you come here? 
1797,DOCTOR: I came here to warn you that humans are about to enter your
1798,caves. 
1799,SILURIAN JR: Shall I destroy him? 
1800,SILURIAN: No. Take him to the cages.

1809,inside. The door shuts again and the Silurians leave.) 
1810,BAKER: What happened? I thought you were going to get help. 
1811,"DOCTOR: Don't worry, help's on the way. I only wish it weren't. "
1812,SILURIAN: I repeat. Why have you come here? 
1813,DOCTOR: I came here because I want to help you. 
1814,"BAKER: Just a minute, what do you think you're doing? "
1815,SILURIAN JR: Quiet! 
1816,SILURIAN: How can you help us? 
1817,"DOCTOR: Look, people are coming. Many people are coming here. I want"
1818,you to meet them in peace. 
1819,SILURIAN: Who are these people? 
1820,"DOCTOR: Well, they're soldiers, but they won't attack you unless you"
1821,attack them first. 
1822,SILURIAN: Why do you want to help us? 
1823,DOCTOR: Because I want there to be peace between you and the humans.
1824,This is their planet now.

1839,Brigadier's plans. 
1840,DOCTOR: I was simply trying to prevent a massacre. 
1841,BAKER: What guarantee have you got that these creatures aren't going to
1842,set an ambush? 
1843,DOCTOR: I had to take that risk. At least there's a chance they won't
1844,start killing each other. 
1845,(The young Silurian comes up to the cage.) 
1846,DOCTOR: Have you seen the humans yet? Have you spoken to them? 
1847,SILURIAN JR: I have destroyed them. And now I shall destroy you. (The

1857,Doctor as he falls.) 
1858,"SILURIAN JR: We have no need for it, or those soldiers sent to attack"
1859,us. I have dealt with them. 
1860,BAKER: Doctor! 
1861,SILURIAN: I gave you no orders to do this. 
1862,SILURIAN JR: But they were carrying weapons like this one. They can no
1863,longer harm us. 
1864,SILURIAN: But now they will send others. You forget there are now
1865,millions of these men.

1877,BRIGADIER: Yes.

1879,"there a moment ago, and. Well, what are we going to do, sir? "
1880,BRIGADIER: Afraid there's not much we can do. We're trapped. 
1881,HAWKINS: I suppose we'll just have to sit and wait until somebody gets
1882,us out. 
1883,BRIGADIER: We can't afford to wait too long. 
1884,HAWKINS: At least we've got food and water. 
1885,"BRIGADIER: Yes but we have a limited supply of air, and we're using it"

1893,"LAWRENCE: Really, Miss Shaw. "
1894,MASTERS: It's a remarkable accumulation of evidence. 
1895,LAWRENCE: It's a lot of nonsense. The power losses are a technical
1896,"problem. All I need is more reliable staff, and more facilities. Not a"
1897,lot of cloak and dagger people cluttering up the place. 
1898,(The phone rings.)

1908,destroyed. 
1909,SILURIAN: We have studied your weapons. They are primitive. 
1910,"DOCTOR: Look, you've got no idea of the fighting power of the humans. "

1938,"LAWRENCE: One minute, please. "
1939,"MASTERS: I see. Well, continue the search. Let me know if there's any"

1941,"DAWSON: Search party? Good heavens, if they can't find them they'll be"
1942,dead by now. 
1943,MASTERS: Why do you say that? 
1944,DAWSON: I found Doctor Quinn's body. I've seen what these Silurians do.
1945,
1946,LAWRENCE: They obviously got lost. 
1947,"DAWSON: Well then, that's all the more reason to get more men and"
1948,equipment. You could mount an all-out attack. You could send troops
1949,into every one of those caves. 
1950,MASTERS: The caves are vast. We'd need hundreds of men. 
1951,DAWSON: But there may be hundreds of Silurians down there. 
1952,LAWRENCE: Now you don't really believe that. 
1953,DAWSON: Yes! You've seen them. 
1954,"LIZ: Yes, so has the Doctor. "
1955,"DAWSON: Right. Three people have seen them. They do exist, and we've"
1956,got to attack them first. 
1957,"LIZ: Just because they're an alien species, that doesn't mean we have"
1958,to kill them.

1972,SCIENTIST: It projects a small piece of metal at high speed. 
1973,SILURIAN JR: Crude. It is a fitting weapon for apes. 
1974,"SCIENTIST: The device has a certain ingenuity. Remember, one of us was"
1975,wounded by such a weapon. 
1976,SILURIAN JR: The apes have become dangerous. They must be destroyed. 
1977,SCIENTIST: Our leader seems to have different views. 
1978,SILURIAN JR: I know. He has taken one of these creatures into our
1979,control room. He is talking to it. 
1980,SCIENTIST: Perhaps it may give him useful information. 
1981,SILURIAN JR: What information can we gain from apes? His concern for
1982,them may be dangerous!

1986,Doctor? 
1987,LIZ: He went down into the caves. 
1988,LAWRENCE: What? 
1989,LIZ: Ahead of the Brigadier. He wanted to make contact with the
1990,Silurians. 
1991,DAWSON: Make contact? 
1992,MASTERS: What was he going to say to them? 
1993,LIZ: He thought if he could warn the Silurians first. 
1994,"DAWSON: He warned them? Why, the Brigadier has probably walked straight"
1995,into a trap. 
1996,LIZ: He wanted to prevent bloodshed. 
1997,DAWSON: But 
1998,LIZ: He has gone down into those caves to try and help. He is risking
1999,his own life. 
2000,MASTERS: So now you expect us to send troops down there? 
2001,"LIZ: No, no, no, that's the last thing he'd want. "

2016,SILURIAN: This is our planet. We were here before man. We ruled this
2017,world millions of years ago. 
2018,DOCTOR: Then why did you stay down here? 
2019,SILURIAN: A small planet was approaching the world. We calculated that
2020,"it would draw off our atmosphere, destroying all life. We built this"
2021,"place, and suspended our lives till the atmosphere should return. "
2022,"DOCTOR: A small planet? Yes, of course. But don't you see, that small"

2042,"DOCTOR: No, you mustn't, otherwise there'll be the most terrible war. "
2043,SILURIAN: You 
2044,"DOCTOR: But if you trust me, I think I can persuade the humans that you"
2045,are prepared to live with them on this planet in peace. 
2046,SILURIAN: There is not room for both civilisations. 
2047,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, I think there is. You see, your people are used to"
2048,"living in extreme heat, whereas these areas on Earth are of little"
2049,interest to man. I believe with your advanced technology that you could
2050,build cities in parts of the world that man has hitherto completely
2051,ignored. 
2052,SILURIAN: Would your people agree to this? 
2053,"DOCTOR: Well, they're not my people, but I think I could convince them,"
2054,on the condition that you release those trapped men first. 
2055,SILURIAN: Those apes have only shown hostility to us.

2080,live together on this planet. 
2081,SILURIAN JR: This planet is ours!

2173,authority. 
2174,SILURIAN JR: This is the method we used against them before. 
2175,SILURIAN: They were animals then. They are civilised now. 
2176,SILURIAN JR: That makes them all the more dangerous to us. 
2177,SILURIAN: I do not believe so. 
2178,SILURIAN JR: You are no longer fit to lead us. 
2179,SILURIAN: I shall destroy you if you defy me again. Now go.

2186,advanced. 
2187,SILURIAN: The other prisoner has been released. 
2188,"DOCTOR: Baker? Why, that's splendid. "
2189,"SILURIAN: Doctor, listen to me. He has been infected with a deadly"
2190,disease which may destroy millions of his species. 
2191,DOCTOR: But this is diabolical. 
2192,SILURIAN: It is not my doing. There are those of us unwilling to share
2193,this planet. 
2194,DOCTOR: Is there any cure for this disease? 
2195,SILURIAN: No. But I have brought the bacteria. Perhaps your scientists
2196,can find a cure. 
2197,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, of course, but you must release me at once. "
2198,SILURIAN: Come with me.

2201, BRIGADIER: The men have had a chance to rest now.

2203,find the Doctor. 
2204,(Baker enters.) 
2205,LIZ: Major Baker! How did you get out? Have you seen the Doctor? 
2206,"BAKER: Oh yes, I saw him all right, with his Silurian friends! "
2207,"BRIGADIER: Major Baker, just exactly what are you implying? "
2208,BAKER: Huh! They didn't keep him caged up like an animal for very long.
2209,"He warned them that you were coming, so they could set up an ambush! "
2210,"LIZ: No, that's not "
2211,BAKER: He's gone over to their side! 
2212,BRIGADIER: I don't believe that. 
2213,"MASTERS: Now, wait a minute! They had you caged up? How did you escape?"
2214,
2215,"BAKER: Well, I got away when they weren't looking. Look, it doesn't"
2216,matter about me. We must blow up every entrance to those caves before
2217,the Silurians overrun us! 
2218,DOCTOR: That is precisely what we must not do. 
2219,BAKER: You! 
2220,DOCTOR: Now everyone move well away from Major Baker. Now keep right
2221,back from him. Right back. 
2222,BAKER: What are you talking about? 
2223,"DOCTOR: Major Baker, you are ill. You are very, very ill. "
2224,"BAKER: Oh, you don't get out of it like that. I'm placing you under"
2225,arrest. 
2226,BRIGADIER: Wait 
2227,"(Baker goes to grab the Doctor, who jumps up onto a table.) "
2228,DOCTOR: Keep back from him! Look at your wrist. Look at it! 
2229,(There are pustules on Baker's wrist and forearm. He collapses.)

2232,
2233, SILURIAN JR: Why did you give him the bacteria? Do
2234,you want this species to destroy us? 
2235,"SILURIAN: They will not destroy us, and we need not destroy them. Both"
2236,species can live together. 
2237,SILURIAN JR: That is impossible! 
2238,SILURIAN: I am the leader! I have decided! 
2239,SILURIAN JR: Not any more!

2243, [Conference room]
2244,
2245, DOCTOR: This whole place should be closed down and
2246,put in strict quarantine immediately. 
2247,LAWRENCE: It would bring the centre to a standstill. 
2248,"DOCTOR: Yes, and about time too. Well I've got to get down to the"
2249,research centre and try to find an antidote. 
2250,"LAWRENCE: I refuse to permit this. Look, Edward, can't you stop him?"
2251,This whole story is absurd. 
2252,"DOCTOR: You just don't understand, do you, Doctor Lawrence? "
2253,MASTERS: I'm afraid I don't either. You say these creatures have
2254,"infected us with a plague, but do you still want us to negotiate with"
2255,them? 
2256,DOCTOR: That is precisely what I want. But if this bacteria isn't
2257,contained there won't be anybody left to negotiate. 
2258,(Liz enters.) 
2259,LIZ: Baker's gone. Doctor Meredith's just taken him to the hospital. 
2260,DOCTOR: That's the worst thing that could have happened. Why didn't you
2261,stop him? 
2262,LIZ: I tried. He wouldn't listen. 
2263,"DOCTOR: Brigadier, we've got to go down to the hospital straight away"
2264,before Baker spreads that infection. 
2265,BRIGADIER: But surely hospital's the right place for Baker? 
2266,DOCTOR: Meredith does not know what he's dealing with. Nobody does! Now
2267,"please, do as I say. "
2268,"BRIGADIER: All right. You'll have to excuse me, sir. (Liz, the Doctor"
2269,and the Brigadier leave.) 
2270,LAWRENCE: What do you want me to do? 
2271,MASTERS: This could be a national disaster. I must get back to London. 
2272,LAWRENCE: What about the research centre? 
2273,"MASTERS: I'm sorry, Charles, but I intend to recommend that this centre"
2274,be closed immediately. 
2275,LAWRENCE: But all my work? The delay will be crippling. 
2276,MASTERS: My report will of course exonerate you completely. I'm sure
2277,"you've done everything in your power. Well, I must be going. "
2278,(Masters sways as he stands up.) 
2279,LAWRENCE: Are you feeling all right? 
2280,MASTERS: I didn't get any sleep last night. I'll send you a copy of my

2301,MAN: Alien?

2303,draws his revolver.)

2319,"LIZ: Yes, nearly. Do you think pumping broad-spectrum antibiotics into"
2320,everyone is going to do any good? 
2321,DOCTOR: It's all we can do at the moment. 
2322,"LIZ: Will you roll up your sleeve please, Doctor? "
2323,"DOCTOR: Well, now wait a minute, Liz "
2324,LIZ: Now you have been exposed to the infection just as much as
2325,everyone else. 
2326,DOCTOR: Liz 
2327,"LIZ: I know all about your different biochemistry, but we don't know if"
2328,it makes you immune. Now roll up your sleeve. Come on. 
2329,"DOCTOR: Yes, all right, have it your own way. "
2330,"(While Liz gives the injection, the Doctor looks up then wipes a bead"
2331,of moisture from his forehead.) 
2332,LIZ: Did it hurt? 
2333,"DOCTOR: Did what hurt? Oh yes, it was agony. "
2334,LIZ: Have you managed to identify the bacterium? 
2335,"DOCTOR: No, not yet, I'm still waiting for that scanning microscope. "
2336,(The Brigadier enters.) 
2337,DOCTOR: It's supposed to be on its way. 
2338,"BRIGADIER: It'll be here, Doctor. "
2339,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm glad to hear it. Now then, how about that hospital? "
2340,BRIGADIER: I've got the entire place cordoned off. 
2341,"DOCTOR: Good, and your own men? "
2342,BRIGADIER: They've all been treated. We've sent in a medical team to
2343,help Doctor Meredith in the hospital. 
2344,DOCTOR: Splendid. Has anybody else gone down with the infection? 
2345,"LIZ: Yes, Miss Dawson. She collapsed half an hour ago. "
2346,"BRIGADIER: Yes, and the doctor and the nurse we saw at the hospital,"
2347,and the ambulance man who took Baker there. Now has everyone here been
2348,inoculated? 
2349,"LIZ: Yes, they've all been taken care of, except Doctor Lawrence. I"
2350,can't find him anywhere. 
2351,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I'd be very happy to lose him. What about that chap"
2352,"from London, Masters? "
2353,LIZ: Haven't seen him either. Better go and find both of them. 
2354,(Liz leaves.) 
2355,"BRIGADIER: Do you think we'll be able to contain this disease, Doctor? "
2356,"DOCTOR: We may be able to contain it. The question is, can we cure it?"
2357,Excuse me. 
2358,BRIGADIER: We were in contact with Baker. Does that mean that we're
2359,infected too? 
2360,"DOCTOR: Can't be sure, Brigadier. We can't be sure of anything. "

2366,DOCTOR: Gone where? 
2367,LIZ: He caught the London train. He must be nearly there by now. 
2368,"BRIGADIER: Right, I'll get onto it. Maybe we can get him at the"
2369,"station. Will you come with me, Miss Shaw? "
2370,"LIZ: Oh, I'm helping the Doctor. "
2371,BRIGADIER: I'll need help manning the phones.

2375,LIZ: I will not be spoken to in that way! 
2376,DOCTOR: Liz. 
2377,LIZ: Doctor! 
2378,"DOCTOR: Go with him, please. Anyone who's been in contact with Masters"

2403,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. Now then, have they found Masters? "
2404,"BRIGADIER: Not yet, they've sent a police car to the station. "
2405,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, he's got to be found and put into quarantine at"
2406,once. 
2407,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, suppose I'm a carrier? "
2408,"DOCTOR: No, I don't think you are. So far the antibiotics have held the"
2409,"disease in check. Have you finished? Good, splendid. "
2410,TECH: Yes. 
2411,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
2412,(The technicians leave.) 
2413,"BRIGADIER: What do you think the Silurians will do now, Doctor? "
2414,"DOCTOR: Well, it's hard to say really. I think they'll lie low for a"
2415,"while, and let the disease really get to work. "
2416,"BRIGADIER: Well I've got men at all the cave mouths, and I've sent for"
2417,reinforcements so we'll be ready for them if they do try anything. 
2418,"DOCTOR: Brigadier, at all costs we must avoid a pitched battle. "
2419,"BRIGADIER: You don't still think we can co-exist with the Silurians, do"
2420,you? 
2421,"DOCTOR: Well don't forget that one of them released me, which is giving"
2422,us our only chance of defeating this disease. 
2423,BRIGADIER: Maybe one of the Silurians is friendly but the rest seem
2424,determined to wipe us out.

2603, (Liz is onto the third page on her clipboard.) 
2604,"DOCTOR: No, that's no good. You know, I'm beginning to lose confidence"
2605,for the first time in my life. And that covers several thousand years. 
2606,"LIZ: Well, at least you've narrowed it down to forty possible drugs."
2607,Have you considered the addition of A thirty seven in the presence of Z
2608,nineteen might well be effective? 
2609,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's a possibility. Let's try. "
2610,"(They prepare another slide, and just as the Doctor puts it under the"
2611,"microscope, Liz sways, bumping into him.) "
2612,"DOCTOR: Liz, watch what. You all right? "
2613,LIZ: Sorry. I feel dizzy. 
2614,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I expect those antibiotics are wearing off. You'd"
2615,better get down to the sick bay and have another jab. 
2616,LIZ: What about you? 
2617,DOCTOR: I'm all right. 
2618,"LIZ: Oh, come on, Doctor, I think you "
2619,"DOCTOR: Liz, I am all right! "
2620,(A crowd gathers to watch Masters being taken away on a stretcher.)
2621,
2622, [Conference room]
2623,
2624,(Another telephone call.) 
2625,"BRIGADIER: Yes. Could hardly be worse, could it? Right. "
2626,(Liz enters as he puts down the phone.) 
2627,LIZ: Who was that? 
2628,BRIGADIER: The Ministry. 
2629,LIZ: Masters? 
2630,BRIGADIER: He's dead. Outbreaks of the disease are being reported all
2631,over London. 
2632,"(Even the Doctor is starting to feel dizzy now. Lawrence bursts in,"
2633,lesions on his face.) 
2634,LIZ: Doctor Lawrence! His face! 
2635,"BRIGADIER: Doctor Lawrence, you really must report to the isolation"
2636,ward at once. 
2637,LAWRENCE: I've had enough of you. 
2638,"BRIGADIER: I really must insist, sir! You're endangering all of us! "
2639,"LAWRENCE: Insist! Oh, you do insist? "
2640,"BRIGADIER: Now listen, sir "
2641,"LAWRENCE: Before you people came, I was director of an important"
2642,"research establishment. Now the place is shut down, my career's in"
2643,"ruins, and you are to blame! "
2644,BRIGADIER: Oh you're talking absolute nonsense. 
2645,LIZ: Don't argue with him. I'll go and get one of the medical
2646,orderlies. 
2647,(Lawrence stops Liz from leaving.) 
2648,"LAWRENCE: You think I don't know what's going on, don't you?! This"
2649,whole business has been a plot to get rid of me. 
2650,"BRIGADIER: Oh really, Doctor Lawrence. "
2651,LAWRENCE: You think? I know I've got enemies in the Ministry. Even
2652,Masters! 
2653,"LIZ: All right, Doctor Lawrence. We want to help you. "
2654,"LAWRENCE: Well, you can clear out of here, all of you. And take that"
2655,crazy Doctor with you! And all of your military rubbish! I'm in charge
2656,"of this place! Well, are you going? Or do I have to throw you out"
2657,myself! 
2658,(Lawrence leaps over the table to start throttling the Brigadier. He is
2659,"pushed off,"
2660,"suddenly stands still, clutches his chest and falls.) "

2669, [Conference room]
2670,
2671, (Still more telephone calls.) 
2672,"BRIGADIER: All right, thank you. Bad news, Miss Shaw. The first one"
2673,abroad. Paris. 
2674,"LIZ: If we can't contain it in Britain, what chance has the world got? "
2675,BRIGADIER: If only we'd prevented Masters from leaving here! 
2676,(The Doctor enters.) 
2677,DOCTOR: I think I've found it. 
2678,BRIGADIER: You've found the antidote? 
2679,"DOCTOR: Well, it works in the laboratory. Now let's see whether it"
2680,works in practice. 
2681,(The Brigadier picks up a phone.) 
2682,BRIGADIER: Hello? Get me Doctor Crawford.
2683,
2684, [Silurian Base]
2685,
2686, SCIENTIST: This is the closest point to the
2687,human's base. 
2688,SILURIAN JR: Then we will penetrate from here. 
2689,(They start to burn through the rock with their third eyes.) 
2690, [Sickbay]
2691,
2692," DOCTOR: You wanted to see us, Liz? "
2693,"LIZ: Yes, his temperature's dropped, and his pulse is normal. "
2694,"DOCTOR: That's excellent, excellent! Yeah, there's a good chap. That's"
2695,it. Now you'll want to telephone that formula to London. I'll go and
2696,write it out for you straight away. 
2697,LIZ: Thank you. 
2698,(The Doctor leaves.) 
2699,BRIGADIER: Will the medical team be able to mass produce enough in
2700,time? 
2701,"LIZ: Well, they've been standing by for hours. All they need is the"
2702,formula. 
2703,BRIGADIER: I'll get a line open to them. 
2704,(Hawkins enters.) 
2705,"HAWKINS: Sir, the Silurians have killed Sergeant Hart. "
2706,BRIGADIER: Any sign of a major attack? 
2707,"HAWKINS: Yes, they've broken out of their base and are advancing"
2708,everywhere. 
2709,BRIGADIER: Right.
2710,
2711, [Conference room]
2712,
2713, (The phone is ringing as the Brigadier and Liz
2714,enter.) 
2715,BRIGADIER: Lethbridge Stewart? The Daily what? How did you get hold of
2716,"this number? Look, I have no comment to make. Now will you please get"
2717,off this line. What's keeping the Doctor? 
2718,LIZ: You leave him alone. He's got a complicated formula to transcribe.
2719,
2720, [Research Station laboratory]
2721,
2722, (The Doctor pauses writing the formula as he
2723,thinks he can hear something. Behind him the wall beyond the open door
2724,"starts to glow red, then two Silurians walk through the hole and use"
2725,their third eyes on him.)

2730,
2731, BRIGADIER: And there's no news from cave mouth
2732,two? 
2733,"UPTON: We've lost contact with cave mouth two, sir. "
2734,"BRIGADIER: Well, I want reports from all sectors as they come in, and"
2735,get me Captain Hawkins. 
2736,UPTON: Sir! 
2737,(Upton leaves as Liz enters.) 
2738,LIZ: I've checked on the ambulance man in the sick bay. The
2739,discolouration of the skin is fading rapidly. 
2740,BRIGADIER: So the Doctor's antidote seems totally effective? 
2741,"LIZ: So far, yes. "
2742,BRIGADIER: I wish he'd get a move on with that formula!
2743,
2744, [Research Station reception]
2745,
2746, (The unconscious Doctor is being dragged out of
2747,"the laboratory by the Silurian scientist, when Upton comes round the"
2748,corner.) 
2749,UPTON: Sergeant! 
2750,(Junior gives him the third eye treatment.) 
2751,SILURIAN JR: Quickly! There may be others. 
2752,"(The Silurians go through the hole they made in the wall, then Junior"
2753,seals it up again.)
2754,
2755, [Conference room]
2756,
2757, (Both the Brigadier and Liz are fielding phone
2758,calls.) 
2759,BRIGADIER: Hold them long as you can. I'm doing my level best to get
2760,you the support you need. 
2761,LIZ: UNIT control? 
2762,BRIGADIER: Over and out. 
2763,"LIZ: Yes, Doctor Crawford. "
2764,"BRIGADIER: Crewcock, bring that down here. "
2765,"LIZ: I know. Look, I'm terribly sorry. "
2766,"BRIGADIER: Look, what's happening about my call to the Ministry of"
2767,Defence? 
2768,LIZ: Well I'm sure the Doctor won't be much longer. 
2769,"BRIGADIER: Well, look, hurry it up, man. This is top priority! "
2770,LIZ: I do realise. All right. Goodbye. 
2771,(They put their phones down.) 
2772,BRIGADIER: Trouble? 
2773,LIZ: Doctor Meredith is getting very impatient. 
2774,BRIGADIER: I can't say I blame him. 
2775,"LIZ: Give the Doctor a couple more moments. I mean, he may have run"
2776,into some kind of problem.
2777,
2778, [Research Centre reception]
2779,
2780, (Hawkins steps out of the lift and sees Upton's
2781,"body on the floor. He draws his revolver, then goes over to the"
2782,'repaired' hole in the wall. A scientist enters.) 
2783,"HAWKINS: Hey, you. Give me a hand. Well, don't stand there gawping,"
2784,"man! Come on, give me a hand!"
2785,
2786, [Conference room]
2787,
2788," BRIGADIER: Yes, all right, Major Walton. Pull back"
2789,from gallery four and try and hold them at cave mouth three. 
2790,(LIZ answers another phone.) 
2791,LIZ: UNIT control? 
2792,BRIGADIER: Over and out. 
2793,"LIZ: Yes, sir, he's here. Hold the line. The Ministry of Defence. "
2794,"BRIGADIER: Miss Shaw, I must have that formula. "
2795,LIZ: All right. I'll go and see what's holding the Doctor up. 
2796,(Liz leaves.) 
2797,"BRIGADIER: Lethbridge-Stewart here, sir. You got my message? With"
2798,"respect, sir, I don't think you appreciate the gravity of the"
2799,situation. But there's no time to refer it to the Defence Committee.
2800,
2801, [Research Station laboratory]
2802,
2803, (Liz glances at the mark on the wall before
2804,entering the lab.) 
2805,"LIZ: Doctor, the Brigadier "
2806,(Liz steps on broken glass and picks up a large piece of it together
2807,"with a crumpled piece of paper, then gathers up all the other papers on"
2808,the bench and runs.)

2810, [Conference room]
2811,
2812, (The Brigadier is part way through another phone
2813,call.) 
2814,BRIGADIER: But where is he? 
2815,LIZ: I've told you. I've no idea. 
2816,BRIGADIER: You'll read the formula to Doctor Crawford. He's been
2817,hanging on long enough. 
2818,LIZ: Don't you understand? I don't know which is the formula. 
2819,"BRIGADIER: Hello, Doctor Crawford? Look, I'm afraid I'll have to ring"
2820,"you back. There's been yet another delay. Yes, yes, yes, as soon as I"
2821,can. 
2822,"LIZ: Brigadier, there was some glass in the lab. I don't know if"
2823,there's 
2824,(Hawkins enters.) 
2825,"HAWKINS: Sir! Sir, there's been some kind of a raid. Private Upton's"
2826,dead. 
2827,BRIGADIER: In the caves? 
2828,"HAWKINS: No, sir, here. Just down the corridor. And there's a kind of"
2829,scorch mark on the wall. 
2830,"BRIGADIER: Stay here, Miss Shaw. "
2831,LIZ: What? 
2832,BRIGADIER: Stay here! 
2833,"LIZ: Yes, of course. "
2834,"(Liz sorts through the papers, then smoothes out the crumpled piece and"
2835,smiles. She picks up the telephone.) 
2836,"LIZ: Get me Doctor Crawford, please."
2837,
2838, [Silurian cages]
2839,
2840, SCIENTIST: How many humans have survived the
2841,epidemic? 
2842,DOCTOR: They will all survive. 
2843,SILURIAN JR: That is impossible! 
2844,SCIENTIST: You have discovered a cure? 
2845,"DOCTOR: Yes, and soon all the humans will be immune to your epidemic."
2846,"Your plan has failed, as your leader wanted it to fail. "
2847,SILURIAN JR: Our leader is dead. I killed him. I am the leader now.
2848,
2849, [Conference room]
2850,
2851," LIZ: Thank you, Doctor Crawford. "
2852,(The Brigadier and Hawkins enter.) 
2853,BRIGADIER: The Silurians have broken in. 
2854,"LIZ: Well, what about the Doctor? "
2855,"BRIGADIER: Well, I imagine they've taken him to their base. Captain"
2856,"Hawkins, send every man we've got into the caves, and I want all"
2857,civilian personnel evacuated from here immediately. 
2858,HAWKINS: Sir. 
2859,BRIGADIER: And organise a thorough search of that laboratory. 
2860,"HAWKINS: I'll see to it myself, sir. You two, come with me. "
2861,(Hawkins and the soldiers leave.) 
2862,LIZ: I've given the formula to Doctor Crawford. They're going to make
2863,their own tests and then go into mass production of the antidote. 
2864,"BRIGADIER: Well done, Miss Shaw. "
2865,LIZ: What are you going to do about the Doctor? 
2866,BRIGADIER: What can I do? 
2867,LIZ: Try to rescue him! You'll have to attack their base. 
2868,"BRIGADIER: At the moment, they seem to be attacking us."
2869,
2870, [Silurian cages]
2871,
2872, (The sound of the UNIT gunfire is close by.) 
2873,"SILURIAN JR: Since the epidemic has failed, we must use other means. We"
2874,intend to make this planet uninhabitable for humans beings. 
2875,DOCTOR: But you can't do that! You can't exterminate a whole species. 
2876,SILURIAN JR: Is the disperser ready for activation? 
2877,SCIENTIST: All we need now is the power. 
2878,SILURIAN JR: We shall continue to use the electricity of the humans. 
2879,"DOCTOR: I'm afraid you won't be able to do that. Thanks to you, the"
2880,humans are no longer making power. Their generator has been switched
2881,off. 
2882,SCIENTIST: Then you will help us. 
2883,SILURIAN JR: We shall force you to reactivate it. We shall take the
2884,centre!

2887,
2888, (The Brigadier is trying to make a telephone
2889,call.)

2891,this thing? 
2892,(The lights dim and the aircon slows.) 
2893,BRIGADIER: What the devil? 
2894,LIZ: We seem to have switched to an emergency lighting system. 
2895,(She tries another phone.) 
2896,LIZ: Hello? It's dead. 
2897,(They wind the field telephone.) 
2898,BRIGADIER: This one's dead too. And I've just sent the last of my men
2899,into those caves. 
2900,LIZ: What do you mean? 
2901,"BRIGADIER: Because of the attack, I sent every man I've got down to the"
2902,caves and now the Silurians are cutting our communications. 
2903,LIZ: What about your pocket radio? 
2904,"BRIGADIER: No, useless at this depth. "
2905,"LIZ: If they could break in once to get the Doctor, they could break in"
2906,again. 
2907,BRIGADIER: Exactly. Only this time it'll be in force.
2908,
2909, [Silurian hibernation room]
2910,
2911," (The Scientist is using his third eye on a casket,"
2912,with no success.) 
2913,SILURIAN JR: Is the machinery prepared? 
2914,SCIENTIST: I could do nothing without power from the human's generator.
2915,It has ceased to function. 
2916,SILURIAN JR: We shall force them to reactivate it. When your
2917,"instruments register the power, you will revive all our people. Now, I"
2918,shall take the one called the Doctor to the research centre.
2919,
2920, [Research Centre reception]
2921,
2922, BRIGADIER: I'll go to the Ministry myself. We need
2923,a division down here and I'll see we get it. 
2924,(The Brigadier tries to summon the lift.) 
2925,BRIGADIER: What's the matter with this thing? 
2926,LIZ: The telephone's stopped working. 
2927,BRIGADIER: Now the lift as well. 
2928,(The scorch mark in the wall begins to glow.) 
2929,"LIZ: Brigadier, look! "
2930,(The hole reappears and the Doctor walks through.) 
2931,LIZ: Doctor! 
2932,(Followed by Silurians.) 
2933,SILURIAN JR: Put down that weapon! 
2934,"(In the laboratory opposite the hole, Hawkins can hear everything as he"
2935,hides behind the open door.) 
2936,"DOCTOR: Do as he says, Brigadier, or they'll kill us all. "
2937,SCIENTIST: We do not need these humans. 
2938,"DOCTOR: Miss Shaw is a scientist. If I am to do what you want, I shall"
2939,need her help. 
2940,SILURIAN JR: The other one is a soldier. He is dangerous. Kill him! 
2941,(One Silurian starts to use its third eye. Hawkins steps out of the lab
2942,and shoots. The Doctor is grabbed as a shield.) 
2943,DOCTOR: Stop! 
2944,LIZ: Brigadier! 
2945,DOCTOR: No! 
2946,(Hawkins falls to the ground.) 
2947,DOCTOR: Any more killing I shall refuse to help you! You'll have to
2948,kill me too! 
2949,SILURIAN JR: You will take us to the nuclear generator or we will kill
2950,you all! 
2951,DOCTOR: Very well. I'll do as you want.
2952,
2953, [Cyclotron room]
2954,
2955, (A Silurian bursts in and uses its third eye on
2956,the scientists.) 
2957,DOCTOR: Stop! Stop! I said there was to be no more killing! Stay where
2958,you are! This centre is now in the hands of the Silurians. They need
2959,"the use of the generator. Now if you follow carefully the instructions,"
2960,"I shall give you, your lives may be spared. "
2961,SILURIAN JR: Remove the bodies. 
2962,"BRIGADIER: Doctor, what do you think you're doing? "
2963,DOCTOR: Trying to save your lives. Now keep out of the way and keep
2964,quiet. 
2965,SCIENTIST: You will now connect this device to the nuclear generator. 
2966,DOCTOR: The power source is over here. 
2967,(A large contraption with a dish on top is wheeled in.) 
2968,DOCTOR: What is the purpose of this machine? 
2969,SILURIAN JR: That is no concern of yours. 
2970,"DOCTOR: If I'm to help you, I must know. "
2971,SCIENTIST: This is the molecular disperser. It will convert the energy
2972,of the nuclear reactor into microwaves. 
2973,"DOCTOR: Oh, for what purpose? "
2974,SCIENTIST: The microwaves will disperse the molecules of the filter
2975,belt which has enveloped this planet since our time. 
2976,"DOCTOR: But if this process gets out of hand, it will destroy all life"
2977,on the planet. 
2978,SCIENTIST: We can control the process. Commence work! 
2979,BRIGADIER: (sotto) What are they going to do? 
2980,LIZ: (sotto) Destroy the Van Allen belt. 
2981,BRIGADIER: (sotto) What? 
2982,LIZ: (sotto) The Van Allen belt. It surrounds the planet and filters
2983,out some of the sun's radiation. 
2984,BRIGADIER: (sotto) What happens when it's gone? 
2985,"LIZ: (sotto) It gets so hot, we will all die of sunburn on a cloudy"
2986,day. 
2987,BRIGADIER: (sotto) What good will that do them? 
2988,"LIZ: (sotto) They're reptile, cold blooded. They'll thrive in heat. We"
2989,shall die. It'll mean the end of the human race.
2990,
2991, [Silurian hibernation room]
2992,
2993, SILURIAN: The generator of the humans is producing
2994,power. Commence the revival process. 
2995,"(A casket starts to open, but the Silurian inside cannot sit up. The"
2996,lid falls back.) 
2997,SILURIAN: The power is still too low.
2998,
2999, [Cyclotron room]
3000,
3001, SCIENTIST: You will now provide power to operate
3002,the de-hibernation machinery and activate the disperser. 
3003,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, we'll need to stoke up the reactor. Miss Shaw, I'll"
3004,"need your help, please. "
3005,BRIGADIER: You mustn't help him.

3014,"DOCTOR: (sotto) When I tell you, lower all the rods in at once. "
3015,"LIZ: (sotto) Doctor, that will "
3016,"DOCTOR: Liz, I know what I'm doing. Please do as I say. "
3017,(Liz goes back into the cyclotron room and the Doctor speaks into the
3018,microphone.) 
3019,"DOCTOR: All technicians to your usual sectors, please. To your usual"
3020,"sectors, please. All right, Liz? "
3021,LIZ:  Yes. 
3022,DOCTOR: Lower in number one rod. 
3023,LIZ : Number one rod. Check. 
3024,DOCTOR: Lower in number two rod. 
3025, [Cyclotron room] 
3026, LIZ: Number two rod. Check.

3029,LIZ: Number three rod. Check. 
3030, [Cyclotron control room] 
3031, DOCTOR: Now you should be getting enough power now
3032,to get your disperser unit into operation. 
3033,(The dish antenna starts to pulse.) 
3034,SILURIAN JR: Continue to increase the power. 
3035,"DOCTOR: As you wish. Liz, now! "
3036,(The megawatts meter leaps from 1.2 past the end of the red zone. The
3037,disperser goes Bang!)

3040,[Cyclotron room]
3041,
3042, SILURIAN JR: Turn off the reactor! 
3043,SCIENTIST: Remove the uranium from the reactor. 
3044,(The scientist pushes Liz towards a control panel.) 
3045,"DOCTOR : Liz, keep away from those controls! Get back! "
3046,(The panel goes bang as Liz runs back to the desk.) 
3047,DOCTOR : The reactor is now permanently overloaded. 
3048, [Cyclotron control room] 
3049," DOCTOR: There's going to be a massive explosion,"
3050,and a colossal radiation leakage. 
3051, [Cyclotron room] 
3052, BRIGADIER: The whole area will become deadly. 
3053,SILURIAN JR: For how long? 
3054,"LIZ: A quarter of a century, possibly more. "
3055,SCIENTIST: This means nothing to us. We shall return to our base and
3056,wait in hibernation until the radiation has faded. 
3057,SILURIAN JR: Kill these humans! 
3058,SCIENTIST: No! They will all stay here to die from the radiation. 
3059,(The Silurians leave.) 
3060, [Cyclotron control room] 
3061," BRIGADIER: Well done, Doctor. "
3062,"DOCTOR: Well done, Brigadier. "
3063,"BRIGADIER: Well, hadn't you better close down the reactor? "
3064,DOCTOR: I can't. 
3065,BRIGADIER: You were surely bluffing them? 
3066,"DOCTOR: Well, I exaggerated a bit, but I had to push the reactor past"
3067,the critical stage or they'd never have believed me. We'd better get
3068,out of here at once. 
3069,BRIGADIER: We can't. 
3070,DOCTOR: Why not? 
3071,BRIGADIER: They've jammed the lift. There's no way out.
3072,
3073, [Silurian hibernation room]
3074,
3075, (The scientist uses his third eye to push a casket
3076,across the floor.) 
3077,SCIENTIST: The re-hibernation mechanism is defective. One of us must
3078,remain. 
3079,SILURIAN JR: I am the leader. The responsibility is mine. 
3080,SCIENTIST: The one who remains here will die. 
3081,SILURIAN JR: Is sufficient power stored in the hibernation unit? 
3082,"SCIENTIST: Yes, I have set the controls to revive us in fifty years"
3083,from now. 
3084,"SILURIAN JR: When our people revive, you will be the leader. See that"
3085,the apes are destroyed.
3086,
3087, [Cyclotron control room]
3088,
3089, (The power meters are still in the red as the
3090,Doctor works on a bundle of wires under the desk.) 
3091,BRIGADIER: Any good now? 
3092,"LIZ: No, it's still not working. "
3093,"DOCTOR: Give me time, Liz, give me time. There you are. Try that now. "
3094,LIZ: The mega-wattage is still rising. 
3095,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know. I'll try fusing the control of the neutron flow."
3096,Now stand well back and cover your eyes. 
3097,(The Doctor adjusts controls on the desk then joins the Brigadier and
3098,Liz at the back wall. Bang! Flash!) 
3099,"DOCTOR: Well, that seems to have done it."
3100,
3101, [Silurian hibernation area]
3102,
3103,(The Doctor has come potholing again.) 
3104,SILURIAN JR: You are still alive. You tricked us! 
3105,DOCTOR: I managed to close down the reactor. 
3106,"SILURIAN JR: Then the others must be revived at once. But first, I"
3107,shall kill you. 
3108,"(Junior uses his third eye. The Brigadier runs in and shoots him down,"
3109,eventually.) 
3110,BRIGADIER: Doctor! 
3111,"DOCTOR: Well done, Brigadier. Now then "
3112,BRIGADIER: And just what do you think you're doing down here? 
3113,DOCTOR: I'm trying to find out how this hibernation unit works. I must
3114,know if we're going to revive them again. 
3115,BRIGADIER: Revive them? 
3116,"DOCTOR: Yes, not all at once, you understand. One at a time, so that we"
3117,can reason with them. There's a wealth of scientific knowledge down
3118,"here, Brigadier, and I can't wait to get started on it."
3119,
3120, [Cyclotron control room]
3121,
3122," DOCTOR: Yes, well, everything seems to be working"
3123,quite smoothly. I don't think they'll be any more trouble. 
3124,BRIGADIER: Splendid. 
3125,"DOCTOR: Now, don't forget, Brigadier, nobody is to go into that"
3126,Silurian base. 
3127,"BRIGADIER: Yes, Doctor. "
3128,DOCTOR: Miss Shaw and I will be back as soon as possible with some
3129,testing equipment and probably some other scientists. 
3130,"BRIGADIER: Good, good. Well, have a good journey. "
3131,"DOCTOR: Yes. Don't forget, Brigadier. Nobody is to go into that base,"
3132,all right? I'll see you tomorrow. 
3133,LIZ: Goodbye. 
3134,"BRIGADIER: Goodbye, Miss Shaw. "
3135,LIZ: Thank you. 
3136,(The Doctor and Liz leave.) 
3137,BRIGADIER: Corporal Nutting? 
3138,NUTTING: Sir? 
3139,BRIGADIER: Everything set up? 
3140,"NUTTING: Yes, sir. "
3141,"BRIGADIER: Give them time to get clear, and then set off those"
3142,explosive charges. I want that Silurian base sealed permanently. 
3143,(Junior is not quite dead. It drags itself over to a casket and starts
3144,using its third eye.)
3145,
3146, [Wenley Moor]
3147,
3148, (Bessie is sulking in the middle of the moor.) 
3149,LIZ: Shall I walk back and get some help? 
3150,"DOCTOR: No, no. No, it's just a minor technical fault. We'll soon put"
3151,that right. 
3152,(The Doctor pours a small vial of red liquid into the radiator. He
3153,"counts off a few seconds on his watch, Bessie gurgles and the Doctor"
3154,traces a path through her workings with his finger until the liquid
3155,dribbles out of the exhaust pipe on cue and she starts up.) 
3156,DOCTOR: There you are. That's fixed it. 
3157,"(Boom, and it isn't Bessie back-firing.) "
3158,LIZ: What's that? 
3159,"(There is an explosion on the moor. Underground, Junior flails around."
3160,More explosions.) 
3161,DOCTOR: The Brigadier. He's blown up the Silurian base. 
3162,LIZ: He must have had orders from the Ministry. 
3163,DOCTOR: And you knew? 
3164,LIZ: No! The government were frightened. They just couldn't take the
3165,risk. 
3166,DOCTOR: But that's murder. They were intelligent alien beings. A whole
3167,race of them. And he's just wiped them out. 
3168,LIZ: I know. 
3169,"(To a background of primary and secondary explosions, they drive away.)"
