60,SPENCER : Just a minute. 
61,(A grey-suited man comes down some wooden stairs.) 
62,SPENCER: Give me that envelope! 
63,"(Spencer is an airline pilot, and he is pointing an alien weapon at the"
64,man.) 
65,SPENCER: I would advise you to stop. 
66,(There's a pulsing sound and the man drops. Spencer picks up the
67,envelope the man was carrying and drags the body a short way before
68,"covering it with what looks like parachute silk, then leaves. Polly has"
69,seen all this from behind some crates.)

71,
72,"(Spencer walks through an ordinary looking office,"
73,twists a can on a shelf and a secret door opens into a high-tech room.
74,He turns on a monitor.) 
75,SPENCER: Can you come quickly? Trouble. 
76,BLADE : Trouble? What happened? 
77,SPENCER: The postcards. Someone found them. 
78,BLADE : Right.

91,"COMMANDANT: (into phone) All right, all right. So"
92,"you dumped it by number four hangar, but what was it? It was a police"
93,"box? (to Jean) Get me the police chief. All right, you can bring those"
94,planes down now. The obstruction's been cleared. 
95,"MEADOWS: Right, sir. "
96,"JEAN: Do you think it was some kind of practical joke, sir? Students or"
97,maybe someone? 
98,"COMMANDANT: Well, whoever it was they're going to pay for it as soon as"
99,I get my hands on them. I'm not going to have the lives of passengers
100,endangered by practical jokers or anyone else. 
101,JEAN: Superintendent Reynolds? I have the Commandant for you. The Chief
102,of Police. 
103,"COMMANDANT: Listen, what's all this about a police box on the runway?"
104,"Oh. Well, security's got to be tightened up all round. He reports that"
105,four suspects were seen running away from it. 
106,JEAN: Did they catch them? 
107,COMMANDANT: No. Idiot of a policeman lost them. They're probably miles
108,away by now. Get me Immigration. Tell them to let me know if any
109,suspicious characters are seen in the area. 
110,[Airport]
111,
112,(The Doctor and Jamie are hiding under another
113,aeroplane.) 
114,JAMIE: There's Polly! 
115,DOCTOR: Polly! Over here! 
116,"POLLY: Doctor, I've just seen a man killed. "
117,JAMIE: Hit by one of the beasties? 
118,"POLLY: No, no. He was murdered by another man. "
119,"DOCTOR: Get your breath, Polly, and tell us exactly what happened. "
120,"POLLY: Well, I went into the hangar to get away from a policeman, and"
121,there were two men in there. One of them had a gun and he shot the
122,other one. 
123,"DOCTOR: The murderer, did he see you? "
124,"POLLY: Well, he chased me, but I managed to lose him. "
125,DOCTOR: Could you find this hangar again? 
126,"POLLY: Well, I think so. I can remember the name. It was Chameleon"
127,"something or other. Hey, where's Ben? "
128,"DOCTOR: We haven't seen him. Come on, let's find this hangar. "
129,"POLLY: But listen. The bloke with the gun, he'll be looking for me. "
130,"JAMIE: Ah, we'll look after you. Now come on. "
131,POLLY: But where's? What about Ben?

135,(Blade is another pilot.) 
136,BLADE: Who was he? 
137,SPENCER: He found the postcards. 
138,BLADE: His name? 
139,SPENCER: I don't know. I caught him in the office. He found evidence. I
140,had to stop him. 
141,(Blade checks the man's wallet.) 
142,BLADE: You killed Detective Inspector Gascoigne. A policeman. 
143,SPENCER: Do you think a parent sent him? 
144,BLADE: Possibly. It's doesn't matter The important thing is that nobody
145,should find him. Arrange disposal. 
146, [Chameleon Tours office]
147,
148,SPENCER: All right. Get it over here as quickly as
149,possible. A container is on the way. 
150,BLADE: Right. Destroy this. Why have you left those suitcases there? 
151,SPENCER: The detective. He interrupted me. 
152,(Spencer puts the suitcases and wallet through a panel in the wall.
153,There's a whirring sound each time. Then the buzzer sounds.) 
154,BLADE: Spencer! 
155,"POLLY : Look. And, Doctor, the bloke came out of that door"
156,there. 
157,"DOCTOR : Is it locked? Is anyone in there? No, its locked."
158,There's nobody there. 
159,[Chameleon Tours hangar]
160,
161,"DOCTOR: Polly, this man that killed him. Would you"
162,recognise him again? 
163,"POLLY: Well, yes. He chased me. I'd recognise him anywhere. "
164,[Chameleon Tours office]
165,
166,BLADE: Fool.
167,
168, [Chameleon Tours hangar]
169,
170,"DOCTOR: Polly, how do you say he was killed? "
171,POLLY: With a gun. 
172,DOCTOR: Can you describe it to me? 
173,POLLY: No. It was too far away. Why? 
174,DOCTOR: This man was electrocuted. His clothes are all scorched! 
175,"POLLY: It was definitely some kind of a gun, Doctor. "
176,DOCTOR: Maybe. But not one that's not been developed yet on this
177,planet.
178,
179, [Chameleon Tours office]
180,
181,"BLADE: This man they call Doctor, where does he get"
182,his knowledge? 
183,SPENCER: He looks like a normal being. 
184,BLADE: More intelligent then most. He is a threat to our operation. 
185,SPENCER: I'll kill him. 
186,BLADE: No. Get the girl. She can identify you. We can deal with the man
187,later. 
188,SPENCER: He may talk. 
189,BLADE: So? Nobody will believe him.
190,
191,[Chameleon Tours hangar]
192,
193,DOCTOR: We must report this to the authorities. 
194,JAMIE: That man who chased us. We could find him maybe. 
195,"DOCTOR: What, the policeman? Oh, no, no, Jamie. We must find the man in"
196,charge in this place. 
197,POLLY: But what about him? We can't just leave him here. 
198,"DOCTOR: There's nothing else we can do. Now, let's find the main"
199,airport building. Come on.
200,
201,[Gatwick airport]
202,
203,(Spencer is hiding in another hangar as Jamie and
204,the Doctor walk past.) 
205,"JAMIE: Are you sure this is the right way, Doctor? "
206,DOCTOR: This seems to be leading to the main airport building. 
207,(Spencer grabs Polly and fires a pen-like device at her. She is silent
208,as he drags her away.)
209,
210,[Chameleon Tours hangar]
211,
212,"POLLY: Oh, what happened to me? "
213,SPENCER: A temporary disablement. You'll be back to normal any second
214,now. Up here. 
215,POLLY: Where are you taking me? 
216,SPENCER: You'll soon find out. 
217,[Chameleon Tours office]
218,
219,SPENCER: I've got her. 
220,BLADE: Excellent. Did anybody see you this time? 
221,"SPENCER: She was following behind her friends, but they didn't notice. "
222,POLLY: They'll come looking for me. 
223,BLADE: Sit down. 
224,POLLY: Murderers. 
225,"BLADE: You'll have to show us some respect, and answer my questions."
226,Which airline do you work for? 
227,POLLY: I don't understand. 
228,BLADE: You must belong to some airline or the airport authority to be
229,in this part of the airport. 
230,POLLY: I've got nothing to do with the airport. We'd just arrived. We
231,were lost. I was trying to find someone to help me and I saw him kill a
232,man. 
233,SPENCER: You say you'd just arrived? How did you get here? 
234,BLADE: We'll gain nothing by questioning her. The important thing is
235,that we've got her. 
236,POLLY: You don't think my friends are just going to forget me like
237,"that, do you? "
238,(The buzzer sounds.) 
239,"JAMIE : I don't understand it, Doctor. Polly's nowhere to"
240,be seen. Something must have happened to her. 
241,DOCTOR : It's locked Jamie. There's nobody there. 
242,(Polly tries to hammer on the door but Spencer grabs her.) 
243,[Chameleon Tours hangar]
244,
245,"DOCTOR: I'm afraid we're wasting our time here,"
246,"Jamie. The sooner we find the authorities and tell it all to them, the"
247,better. Come on. 
248,JAMIE: All right. 
249,[Chameleon Tours office]
250,
251,"BLADE: Yes, you're right. Your friends are worried"
252,"about you. Well then, we shall have to do something to stop them"
253,worrying.

255, [Immigration]
256,
257,"TANNOY: Would Doctor Scott, passenger recently"
258,"arrived from Alderney on flight number JY17, please return to the"
259,ticket desk.
260,"DOCTOR: This seems to be the way, Jamie. "
261,(They come to passport control.) 
262,"DOCTOR: Excuse me, we're looking for someone in authority. "
263,"JENKINS: Just a moment, sir. All in good time. Thank you, Madam. Now,"
264,"sir, your passport please. "
265,DOCTOR: I've got no time for that. We want to see someone in authority!
266,
267,"JENKINS: I am in authority. Your passport, please. "
268,DOCTOR: You don't understand. We have something important to report. 
269,"JENKINS: Yes, sir. When you've found your passport. The next one,"
270,please. 
271,"JAMIE: What's a passport, Doctor? "
272,DOCTOR: Some sort of official mumbo-jumbo. Look! We've just discovered
273,a dead body out there. Did you hear me? 
274,"JENKINS: Well, sir. If I were you I'd inform the police. "
275,DOCTOR: Then please tell me where we can find them. 
276,"JENKINS: There's probably a policeman in the main concourse, "
277,DOCTOR: And where is that? 
278,JENKINS: Through this door and turn to your left. 
279,"DOCTOR: Thank you. Thank you very much. Come on, Jamie. "
280,"JENKINS: May I see your passport, sir? "
281,DOCTOR: We neither of us have passports! Now does that satisfy you? 
282,"JENKINS: I think you must be mistaken, sir. You couldn't have got on"
283,the aircraft without passports. 
284,DOCTOR: What aircraft? 
285,"JENKINS: The one you arrived on, sir. "
286,JAMIE: We didn't arrive on an aircraft. 
287,"JENKINS: Now look here, sir, this joke's gone on far enough. You know"
288,"and I know that you must have arrived here on the last inbound flight,"
289,which was flight number 729 from Madrid. 
290,JAMIE: Can we not tell him about Tardis? Ow! 
291,(The Doctor stamps on Jamie's foot.) 
292,JENKINS: What's that? 
293,JAMIE: It's the way we got here. 
294,"JENKINS: You gentlemen wouldn't know anything about a police box, would"
295,you? 
296,JAMIE: That's just what I'm saying. We're. Ow! 
297,DOCTOR: I really think that our mode of conveyance is irrelevant. The
298,important thing is that we've discovered a dead body out there and we
299,want to report it to someone in authority. 
300,JENKINS: I think you'll have plenty of opportunity to see someone in
301,authority. 
302,"DOCTOR: Well, thank you. "
303,"JENKINS: Will you take a seat please, over there? "
304,DOCTOR: Thank you very much. 
305,(Jenkins makes a telephone call.) 
306,"JENKINS: Give me the Commandant, please. Hello, sir, Jenkins here."
307,Immigration desk number five. I think I've got two of your suspects
308,here.

310,
311,(Ben is walking past the hangar when he hears
312,hammering. He goes inside to investigate. Blade is fastening a large
313,crate before going into the office.) 
314,BEN: Anyone here? There must be someone around. Anyone here? 
315,"JEAN: Oh, hello, Is Captain Blade about? "
316,"BEN: Well, I don't know. I'm a bit lost. "
317,BLADE: Are you looking for me? 
318,"JEAN: Yes, I have your flight schedules here. They're all in order. "
319,BLADE: Thank you. 
320,JEAN: Goodbye. 
321,(Jean leaves.) 
322,BLADE: And what do you want? 
323,"BEN: I'm looking for the way out, mate. "
324,BLADE: This is private property. Visitors are not welcome. Do you
325,belong to the airport staff? 
326,"BEN: Yeah, I started today. But I didn't mean to come in here. I just"
327,"got lost, see. "
328,BLADE: Are you sure? 
329,"BEN: Of course I am. Look, are you going to direct me or not? "
330,"BLADE: Yes, of course. Come on, I'll show you the way."

332, [Immigration]
333,
334,COMMANDANT: You say this girl actually witnessed a
335,murder? 
336,"DOCTOR: Yes, she saw the man killed. "
337,JAMIE: He was electrocuted with a ray gun. 
338,COMMANDANT: A what? 
339,"DOCTOR: Oh, what does it matter what sort of gun. The point is he was"
340,killed and my friend saw it happen. 
341,COMMANDANT: Where is she? I'd like to talk to her. 
342,"JAMIE: Well, that's another thing. She's vanished. "
343,"COMMANDANT: Oh, people who vanish, ray guns. Is this some sort of joke?"
344,
345,DOCTOR: You wouldn't think it a joke if you'd come and see the body. 
346,COMMANDANT: What flight did these people come in on? 
347,"JENKINS: Well sir, they came with the passengers from flight 729 from"
348,"Madrid, but they've no passports. "
349,COMMANDANT: Perhaps you'd kindly explain why you have no passports? 
350,"DOCTOR: Oh look, we're all wasting time. Now, are you going to come and"
351,"see that body, or am I going to find someone who really is in charge in"
352,this place? 
353,"COMMANDANT: I am in charge in this place, thank you. Now, you'll both"
354,accompany me to this hangar immediately. 
355,DOCTOR: Well thank you. Thank you very much. At last. 
356,COMMANDANT: Tell Air Traffic Control where I am. 
357,"JENKINS: Yes, sir. Immigration desk number five here. Number One's just"
358,gone to the hangar area. He wanted me to let you know. As a matter of
359,"fact, he has just gone to look for a dead body. Yes, It's going to be"
360,"one of those days, isn't it."

363,
364,"(Blade selects a postcard of the Eiffel Tower, puts"
365,a French postage stamp on it then repeats with the next postcard.) 
366,BLADE: Get her? 
367,SPENCER: She's being processed. They can take another on the next
368,flight. 
369,BLADE: Excellent. 
370,"(Blade takes a hypodermic syringe from a tray, then opens a cabinet"
371,door. An inhuman arm reaches out. He injects it then the buzzer
372,sounds.)

374, [Chameleon Tours hangar]
375,
376,"JAMIE: The body, it's gone. "
377,COMMANDANT: You're quite sure you got the right hangar? 
378,"JAMIE: Aye, the name's up outside. The body was lying just here. "
379,"DOCTOR: Well, let's see what we have got, shall we? "
380,(The Doctor uses a magnifying glass to examine the concrete floor.) 
381,COMMANDANT: What exactly are you doing? 
382,"DOCTOR: For the police, of course. The trouble is, I can't tell them"
383,who he was. 
384,"COMMANDANT: Some sort of mystery man, no doubt? "
385,"DOCTOR: Yes, as a matter of fact he was. There was nothing in his"
386,pockets to identify him. 
387,"COMMANDANT: Oh, a man with nothing in his pockets? "
388,"DOCTOR: Yes, I was rather surprised myself. No, wait a minute, there"
389,was one thing. 
390,COMMANDANT: What did he have in his pocket? 
391,DOCTOR: This. 
392,COMMANDANT: A postage stamp? 
393,"DOCTOR: Ah, but it's Spanish and it hasn't been used. "
394,"COMMANDANT: Oh, I am sure that'll make all the difference. "
395,"DOCTOR: Exactly. Hello, this is interesting. "
396,COMMANDANT: What have you found now? 
397,DOCTOR: It's burnt fibres. 
398,"JAMIE: What about this, Doctor? This wasn't here before. It's a burn"
399,mark. 
400,"DOCTOR: You're right, Jamie. That's quite new. Well, it's good to see"
401,someone is using their intelligence. 
402,"COMMANDANT: Oh, I've had enough of this. You two are coming with me. "
403,DOCTOR: That was definitely made by a ray gun. 
404,"COMMANDANT: Ray gun, burnt fibres, foreign stamps. "
405,DOCTOR: Unused foreign stamps. 
406,"COMMANDANT: All right, unused foreign stamps. I must be as mad as you"
407,are even to be listening you. 
408,"DOCTOR: You know what they've done with it, don't you? "
409,COMMANDANT: Done with what? 
410,DOCTOR: The body. Somewhere there's a large packing case. 
411,"JAMIE: Right behind you, Doctor. "
412,"(Jamie starts to pull at the lid. It says made in Poland, by the way.) "
413,BLADE: Can I help you? 
414,COMMANDANT: Are you connected with Chameleon Tours? 
415,"BLADE: Yes. I'm Captain Blade, Chief Pilot. "
416,"COMMANDANT: Ah, these gentlemen seem to think there's an incident"
417,happened in here. 
418,BLADE: An incident? 
419,COMMANDANT: Would you mind if we had a look in this packing case? 
420,BLADE: May I ask who you are? 
421,COMMANDANT: I'm the Commandant. 
422,"BLADE: Yes, of course. What you expect to find? "
423,JAMIE: A dead man. 
424,BLADE: How very interesting. 
425,(Blade opens the case with a crowbar.) 
426,"COMMANDANT: Plastic cups! Now, I'm going to do some investigating of my"
427,own. 
428,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm glad I've roused your interest. "
429,"COMMANDANT: Oh, but you have. And what I am going to investigate is you"
430,"and why you're both here in the airport. Thank you, Captain Blade. Come"
431,"on, you two. Out! "
432,"DOCTOR: Come on, Jamie. We'd better humour him. "
433,"(The Commandant, the Doctor and Jamie leave.) "
434,BLADE: Bring him down. 
435,(A figure is helped to the stairs.) 
436,BLADE: It's all right. 
437,(All we can see is an inhuman hand.) 
438,SPENCER: Will he survive? 
439,BLADE: If we hurry. 
440,SPENCER: There you are. We've got to get you to the airport building
441,and you'll be safe. 
442,BLADE: He's reaching suffocation point. Hurry.

444, [Immigration]
445,
446,DOCTOR: If you'd had let me search the place
447,properly we might have found 
448,COMMANDANT: That hangar is leased to a private charter company. I've no
449,"right to search in there, let alone you. Now, will you kindly sit down"
450,"and keep quiet. Jenkins, get on to Superintendent Reynolds. This is his"
451,job. These people are trespassing. 
452,"JENKINS: I've just got another flight coming through, sir. "
453,"COMMANDANT: All right, I'll do it. "
454,"JAMIE: Doctor, look! "
455,(Polly has arrived at the desk and is getting out her passport.
456,"Meanwhile, Spencer and Blade are helping the mysterious figure up an"
457,escalator and through the airport concourse.)Â 
458,"DOCTOR: Commandant, this is the girl I was telling you about. "
459,POLLY: I beg your pardon? 
460,COMMANDANT: Do you know these gentlemen? 
461,"POLLY: No. Why, should I? "
462,"COMMANDANT: According to them, they know you. "
463,"DOCTOR: Now where have you been, Polly? "
464,POLLY: Polly? My name isn't Polly. You must have made a mistake. I've
465,never seen them before in my life

933,"SAMANTHA: Look, a postcard of Zurich, stamped with a Swiss stamp, all"

935,JAMIE: Well? 
936,"SAMANTHA: Oh, you're a right one, aren't you. Don't you see. This could"
937,"explain the card I got from Brian. It was posted in Rome, but that"
938,doesn't mean to say that he posted it. 
939,"JAMIE: Oh, I see. We'd better tell the Doctor about this. How long's he"

1017,anything. I think I'll go and have a look round that Chameleon Hangar. 
1018,"JAMIE: Ah, not by yourself. "
1019,"SAMANTHA: Well, I suppose it would be better if I had a man with me. "
1020,"JAMIE: Aye. Oh, if only the Doctor hadn't told me to watch this place. "
1021,"SAMANTHA: Oh, do you always do everything you're told? "
1022,JAMIE: No. But the Doctor trusts me.

1041,"COMMANDANT: Oh, very well. Make it brief. "
1042,DOCTOR: Thank you. I have just carried out a search of the Chameleon
1043,"Tours hangar. In a packing case, I found the body of a man. "
1044,"CROSSLAND: You never told me that, Doctor. Another dead man? "
1045,"DOCTOR: No, he was in a stupefied state, a sort of coma. "
1046,COMMANDANT: Who's this one?

1056,"DOCTOR: Things are not always what they seem. Oh careful, it's"
1057,dangerous. Chameleon Tours are not quite what they seem either. 
1058,COMMANDANT: Oh? And what's your theory? 
1059,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm afraid you won't believe it when you hear it."
1060,"However. First, Inspector Gascoigne was murdered with a ray gun. "
1061,CROSSLAND: A ray gun? 
1062,DOCTOR: A weapon that has not yet been developed on this Earth. 
1063,"COMMANDANT: Oh, really! "
1064,"DOCTOR: There, you see? I knew you wouldn't believe it. What's the use?"
1065,
1066,"CROSSLAND: No, now be patient, sir. We are trying to understand you. "
1067,"DOCTOR: Very well. Next, I believe Chameleon Tours to be merely a"
1068,"front, a cover. "
1069,COMMANDANT: For what? 
1070,DOCTOR: For the mass kidnapping of young people. 
1071,COMMANDANT: And is all this supposed to be taking place in my airport? 
1072,"DOCTOR: Yes, at this very moment! "
1073,"COMMANDANT: Oh, that's quite enough. Can't you take that fellow into"
1074,custody? 
1075,"CROSSLAND: Well, I'm very sorry, sir, but you know he hasn't broken any"
1076,"law, except for this immigration business, and that's not my"
1077,responsibility. 
1078,DOCTOR: But Brian Briggs is your responsibility. 
1079,COMMANDANT: And who is he? 
1080,DOCTOR: He's a young man who went on a Chameleon Tour and vanished. 
1081,"CROSSLAND: Now, come on Doctor, wait a minute. We're not certain of"
1082,that yet. 
1083,"DOCTOR: Well, he's nowhere to be found. "
1084,"CROSSLAND: Well, no. "
1085,DOCTOR: And neither are my two friends. Which to my mind proves my
1086,point. Chameleon Tours are a cover for the abducting of young people. 
1087,COMMANDANT: And just where do you think they're taking them? 
1088,"DOCTOR: Well, in view of the facts that I've already presented, the ray"
1089,"gun, this pen and one or two other things, I think we're dealing with"
1090,people who are not from this planet. 
1091,COMMANDANT: That hardly answers my que. What did you say? 
1092,"DOCTOR: You see, I knew you wouldn't believe me. "
1093,"COMMANDANT: Oh, this is absolute, arrant nonsense/ "
1094,"CROSSLAND: Er, look, Doctor, I think you ought to produce some evidence"
1095,to support all this. 
1096,DOCTOR: Evidence? What about this pen? 
1097,COMMANDANT: A pen! Do you call that evidence? 
1098,DOCTOR: I'll demonstrate it for you. Excuse me. Would you mind helping
1099,us? 
1100,MEADOWS 2: I don't understand.

1151,somewhere in Germany.

1153,Tours. 
1154,COMMANDANT: Just what are you all talking about? 
1155,"SAMANTHA: Well, you see. They give out these cards and get the kids to"
1156,write home to their parents before they go. Then the Chameleon Tours
1157,lot take the cards abroad and they post them back to Britain. 
1158,CROSSLAND: So the parents think the children have arrived safely. 
1159,"SAMANTHA: Doctor, what do you think does happens to them? "
1160,"COMMANDANT: Now, now, now, this is all mere supposition. "
1161,"SAMANTHA: Oh, to you, maybe. But one of those kids happens to be my"
1162,brother. 
1163,COMMANDANT: Your brother? 
1164,"CROSSLAND: Aye, sir. This is the young lady whose brother's missing,"
1165,"and you see, she did get a card from him in Rome. "
1166,COMMANDANT: But why would anyone want to abduct these young people? 
1167,"DOCTOR: Well, if we knew that we wouldn't be sitting here. "
1168,"COMMANDANT: Inspector, can I have a word with you? "
1169,(They move away from the desk.) 
1170,"COMMANDANT: You don't think this fellow's a little unbalanced, do you? "
1171,"CROSSLAND: Oh maybe a wee bit unorthodox, sir, but after all, he's"
1172,given us the only lead we've got so far. If you could just see your way
1173,to giving him a free hand. 
1174,COMMANDANT: A free hand? 
1175,"CROSSLAND: Just to poke around a little bit, sir. "
1176,COMMANDANT: Do you think it's safe to let the fellow roam round the
1177,airport? 
1178,"CROSSLAND: You can rely on us to keep an eye on him, sir. "
1179,"COMMANDANT: All right, but on your head be it. "
1180,CROSSLAND: I personally will investigate Chameleon Tours. Then I'll
1181,report back to you here if I've found out anything. But in the
1182,"meantime, if you could just keep everything going as normal, you"
1183,understand? We don't want them to get wind of anything. 
1184,"COMMANDANT: No, no, no, no, no. Doctor, I'll give you the freedom of"

1232,you ask? 
1233,DOCTOR: Eight flights a day and only four planes. Is that normal?

1778,"SAMANTHA: Oh, good. Well who got it? "
1779,"ANN: We can't tell you that, I'm afraid, but our manager would like to"
1780,see you. He's just through there. 
1781,"SAMANTHA: Oh right, ta. "
1782,(Samantha goes to the rear cubicle.) 
1783,"ANN: Now, who's got their postcards ready?"
1784,
1785, [Chameleon Tours cubicle]
1786,
1787,"SAMANTHA: Er, you wanted to see me? "
1788,"SPENCER: Yes, indeed. You won't escape again. "
1789,"(Meanwhile, Jamie and the other young people are boarding their plane."
1790,What about his lack of passport? Oh well.)
1791,
1792, [Air Traffic Control]
1793,
1794,HESLINGTON: Chameleon 419. Clearance correct. 
1795,BLADE : Chameleon 419. Taxi Clearance. 
1796,HESLINGTON: Chameleon 419. Taxi following southern taxiway for
1797,departure runway 27. 
1798,BLADE : Roger. 
1799,"COMMANDANT: Well, this time they'll have the RAF on their tail. "
1800,"DOCTOR: How high can fighters go these days, Commandant? "
1801,"COMMANDANT: Oh, ten miles plus. "
1802,DOCTOR: How futile. 
1803,(Chameleon 419 takes off.) 
1804,"JEAN: RAF Manston, sir. "
1805,"COMMANDANT: Oh, good. Hello, old boy. The Chameleon Rome flight's just"
1806,"taken off. They're on Amber one, at flight level 210. Right. Good man. "
1807,(A fighter plane takes off from Kent to intercept.)

1811,ANN: You can unfasten your seat belts now. Thank
1812,you. 
1813,(Jamie is very pale.) 
1814,ANN: Are you all right? 
1815,"JAMIE: Oh aye, I'll be all right. "
1816,ANN: Good. 
1817,(Then Jamie makes a sprint for the rear toilets.)
1818,
1819, [Air Traffic Control]
1820,
1821,COMMANDANT: That's the fifty mile mark they're
1822,passing now. 
1823,DOCTOR: Normally you don't plot them at this range? 
1824,"COMMANDANT: No, there's too much traffic to control. Once they're up"
1825,"and away on their air corridor, we're finished with them. "
1826,"PILOT : Hello, Gatwick Airport. This is RAF 241. How do you read"
1827,me?
1828,
1829, [RAF fighter]
1830,
1831,HESLINGTON : Gatwick Airport to RAF 241. We
1832,read you loud and clear. 
1833,PILOT: Have the Chameleon aircraft in sight. Am following at ten
1834,"thousand feet, heading due south."
1835,
1836, [Air Traffic Control]
1837,
1838,"COMMANDANT: That's him, right on the tail. So far,"
1839,so good.
1840,
1841, [Flight deck]
1842,
1843,ANN: All set. 
1844,BLADE: Something's following us. 
1845,ANN: Another airliner going the same way? 
1846,"BLADE: No, it's too small. It's a fighter. Give me a radar reading. "
1847,ANN: Two three decimal seven nine. 
1848,(Blade uses a targeting device then presses a button.)
1849,
1850, [RAF fighter]
1851,
1852,(A beam of light hits the pilot. He screams.)
1853,
1854, [Air Traffic Control]
1855,
1856,"COMMANDANT: Heslington, that fighter's off course. "
1857,HESLINGTON: Gatwick to RAF 241. Do you read me? 
1858,DOCTOR: That plane isn't just off course. Something's happened to it. 
1859,COMMANDANT: You're right. It's out of control. 
1860,HESLINGTON: Gatwick to RAF 241. Do you read me? 
1861,DOCTOR: I don't think you'll get a reply. 
1862,"COMMANDANT: It's fading, dropping out of our radar. Jean, get me RAF"
1863,Manston. That plane's crashed. 
1864,HESLINGTON: Look at the Chameleon plane. There's something wrong with
1865,that too. 
1866,COMMANDANT: Hmmm? 
1867,DOCTOR: It's standing still! 
1868,COMMANDANT: Impossible. 
1869,"HESLINGTON: No, sir, the blip's stationary. "
1870,"COMMANDANT: That can only mean one thing. It's crashing, too."
1871,
1872,
1873,[Aeroplane]
1874,
1875,"(Actually it isn't. It is hovering, folding it's"
1876,wings back into the fuselage. The passenger cabin is empty. Ann picks
1877,up a small object from each seat and puts them into their own
1878,compartment in her metal container.) 
1879,BLADE : Report to the flight deck immediately. 
1880,[Flight deck]
1881,
1882,BLADE: How many people require passports in order
1883,to leave the airport on the next flight. 
1884,ANN: Twenty five. 
1885,BLADE: You missed this one here. 
1886,ANN: I'm sorry. 
1887,BLADE: Carry on. 
1888,"(Ann returns to the main compartment, but has lost her place. Did she"
1889,pick something up from Jamie's seat or not? As it is empty she assumes
1890,"she must have, and moves on.)"
1891,
1892, [Air Traffic Control]
1893,
1894,"JEAN: Negative report from Air Sea Rescue, sir. "
1895,COMMANDANT: But with two aircraft ditching there must be some signs of
1896,wreckage. 
1897,DOCTOR: Why do you think the Chameleon plane crashed into the sea? 
1898,COMMANDANT: Because it disappeared off our radar screen. 
1899,DOCTOR: But it stood still first. 
1900,COMMANDANT: Because it must have collided with the RAF plane and
1901,dropped like a stone. 
1902,DOCTOR: Why do you think that? 
1903,"COMMANDANT: You see, when a plane on that radar appears to stand still,"
1904,it is in point of fact dropping straight down. 
1905,DOCTOR: What about straight up? 
1906,"COMMANDANT: Oh, my dear Doctor. To get above our radar umbrella like"
1907,that it'd have to climb vertically until it was a hundred miles high.
1908,The darned thing would be in outer space. 
1909,DOCTOR: Exactly. 
1910,(Flight 419 is now a rocket which has left Earth's atmosphere and
1911,entered the blackness of space to rendezvous with a huge conical
1912,"satellite in geostationary orbit, which no one, including NASA, Jodrell"
1913,"Bank and NORAD, has noticed up there. Space doors open and the former"

1918, [Aeroplane]
1919,
1920,(Ann comes out from the flight deck carrying the
1921,metal container. Blade is with her.) 
1922,"ANN: That plane they sent to follow us, should we have destroyed it? "
1923,BLADE: We could eliminate a whole squadron of their toy planes and
1924,they'd never get on to us. Their minds can't cope with an operation
1925,like this. Remember the teaching of our Director. The intelligence of
1926,Earth people is comparable only to that of animals on our planet. 
1927,(Blade and Ann disembark. Jamie comes out of the galley and starts to
1928,"follow them, but hides again when two blank Chameleons come on board"
1929,and start removing the passenger's hand luggage. Finally his chance

1934,(Ann carefully unloads the contents of the
1935,container into a cabinet drawer and leaves. Jamie watches her walk down
1936,"the corridor. He intends to follow, but there are other people around"
1937,so he goes into the stock room instead. The room is completely lined
1938,"with tall metal cabinets full of small specimen drawers, each"
1939,containing six miniaturised humans.) 
1940,ANN: I thought I'd missed one of you. I wondered what happened to you. 
1941,JAMIE: What have you done to them? 
1942,ANN: Close that drawer. 
1943,(Two blank Chameleons enter and seize Jamie.) 
1944,"JAMIE: No. No. Don't. Leave me. No, leave me! "
1945, [Air Traffic Control]
1946,
1947,(Sad telephone calls are being received.) 
1948,"JEAN: Right, thank you. Air Sea Rescue say they're still searching but"
1949,there's no trace yet. 
1950,COMMANDANT: Commandant. I see. Did the pilot managed to bail out? I'm
1951,sorry. They've found the remains of that RAF plane. The pilot had been
1952,electrocuted. 
1953,DOCTOR: Do you still think these people are from Earth? 
1954,"COMMANDANT: I don't know, Doctor. I just don't know what to think. If"
1955,only there was one solid piece of evidence. 
1956,DOCTOR: I think it's just come in. Do you mind if I question him? I
1957,think I know how to make him talk. 
1958,"(The Doctor goes over to Meadows 2, who has just come in, and shows him"
1959,the white armband.) 
1960,"DOCTOR: You know what this is, don't you? "
1961,MEADOWS 2: I don't know what you're talking about. 
1962,DOCTOR: Oh I think you do. Roll up your sleeve. 
1963,"MEADOWS 2: Do I have to take orders from him, sir? "
1964,"COMMANDANT: I think perhaps you should explain, Doctor. After all, this"
1965,man is working for me. 
1966,"DOCTOR: You only think he's working for you. Commandant, your personnel"
1967,"are being systematically replaced, and this is how they are doing it."
1968,"This is not Meadows, it only looks like Meadows. He's wearing one of"
1969,these things on his arm. 
1970,"COMMANDANT: Very well, do as he asks. "
1971,"MEADOWS 2: But sir, this is ridiculous. "
1972,"COMMANDANT: We all have to help in this, Meadows. Roll up your sleeve. "
1973,(Meadows 2 makes a dash for the door.) 
1974,DOCTOR: Stop him! 
1975,(Jean pushes a chair in Meadow 2's path and he falls over it. Two other
1976,ATC restrain him.) 
1977,"COMMANDANT: Now get him in this chair. Jean, send for the police. All"
1978,"right, Doctor, go ahead. "
1979,DOCTOR: Roll up his left sleeve. 
1980,(The black armband is revealed.) 
1981,DOCTOR: There we are. Now then. What happens if I were to turn one of
1982,these? 
1983,MEADOWS 2: Don't touch it! 
1984,"DOCTOR: Ah, I see. Right. Now then, you are going to answer all my"
1985,"questions, and in return, I promise no harm will come to you. Do you"
1986,understand? 
1987,MEADOWS 2: All right. 
1988,DOCTOR: Where are your planes taking all their passengers? 
1989,MEADOWS 2: There's a satellite about a hundred and fifty miles up. 
1990,DOCTOR: Why are you abducting all these young people? 
1991,MEADOWS 2: We had a catastrophe on our planet. A gigantic explosion. As
1992,"you've seen, we have lost our identities. My people are dying out. "
1993,COMMANDANT: But what use would our people be to you? 
1994,MEADOWS 2: Our scientists devised a process so that we could take on
1995,the physical
1996,characteristics of another being. 
1997,DOCTOR: This is part of the process? 
1998,"MEADOWS 2: Yes, that's why you mustn't touch it. "
1999,DOCTOR: How many of these young people do you hope to abduct? 
2000,"MEADOWS 2: This time, fifty thousand. "
2001,COMMANDANT: Fifty thousand! 
2002,DOCTOR: How large is this satellite? 
2003,"MEADOWS 2: On the journey in our planes, the passengers are"
2004,miniaturised. 
2005,DOCTOR: I see. How many of your people are working here at Gatwick
2006,Airport? 
2007,"MEADOWS 2: I don't know. That's the truth, I tell you. I don't know. "
2008,DOCTOR: Very well. What happens to the people whose identity has been
2009,"taken over, the originals? "
2010,MEADOWS 2: They're somewhere in the airport. I don't know exactly
2011,where. 
2012,COMMANDANT: I'll have the whole place torn to pieces to find them. 
2013,"MEADOWS 2: No, you mustn't find them. "
2014,DOCTOR: Why not? 
2015,"MEADOWS: You, you mustn't, that's all. "
2016,"DOCTOR: Because if we do find them, we'll find one of these on their"
2017,"arms, eh? And if we remove it, something terrible will happen to you? "
2018,MEADOWS 2: Yes. 
2019,DOCTOR: What if you have to change back? 
2020,"MEADOWS 2: Well, that can be done, but with the machine. "
2021,DOCTOR: The machine in the Medical Centre? 
2022,"MEADOWS 2: Yes. None of us know where our own originals are, except"
2023,that Nurse. 
2024,DOCTOR: Nurse? What about her? 
2025,MEADOWS 2: Oh she was cunning. She's got her own original with her. 
2026,DOCTOR: Where is it? 
2027,MEADOWS 2: I don't know. 
2028,"DOCTOR: I think you do know. Now, are you going to tell me? "
2029,MEADOWS 2: It's in the Medical Centre. 
2030,"DOCTOR: Right, you're going to show me where it is. "
2031,MEADOWS 2: I daren't. She'll have me destroyed. 
2032,DOCTOR: Are you going to co-operate or are you not? 
2033,(Two policemen enter.) 
2034,MEADOWS 2: All right. It won't make any difference. You'll never see
2035,those fifty thousand young people again. 
2036,DOCTOR: I think I'd better take him down there. The Medical Centre.

2038, [Medical centre]
2039,
2040,(Samantha is gagged and strapped to the couch in
2041,the x-ray room. Pinto goes into the main area and opens a first aid box
2042,on the wall. She activates the monitor at the back of the box.) 
2043,SPENCER : What is it? 
2044,PINTO: This girl. What do we do with her? 
2045,SPENCER : We need to use her as an original. That way we
2046,can get one of our people close to the man who is menacing us. He will
2047,then be killed. 
2048,PINTO: But surely Captain Blade isn't bringing any more of our people
2049,to Earth? 
2050,(The monitor goes blank as the Doctor enters.) 
2051,PINTO: Can I help you? 
2052,DOCTOR: Bring him in. 
2053,(The policemen escort Meadows 2 into the room.) 
2054,PINTO: I'm afraid I don't understand. 
2055,DOCTOR: I think you two have something in common. 
2056,"PINTO: Is this man ill, officer? "
2057,DOCTOR: Roll up your sleeves. 
2058,PINTO: What are you talking about? 
2059,DOCTOR: Officer! 
2060,"PINTO: Please, take your hands off me. "
2061,DOCTOR: Certainly. 
2062,(He pulls up her left sleeve.) I've seen all I want to see. I'll have
2063,"that, if you don't mind. "
2064,(He takes the pen weapon from her tunic.) 
2065,"DOCTOR: Now then, where is her original? "
2066,MEADOWS 2: It's in there. 
2067,PINTO: You can't go in there! 
2068,"DOCTOR: Would you rather be destroyed? Keep an eye on her, officer."
2069,Bring him along.

2072,"DOCTOR: Sam! Sam, are you all right? "
2073,(The Doctor frees Samantha.) 
2074,"DOCTOR: Are you all right, Sam? "
2075,"SAMANTHA: Yeah. Oh, I thought I was done for there. Pins and needles. "
2076,DOCTOR: You're lucky it was no worse. 
2077,(He checks her arm is sheath-free.) 
2078,SAMANTHA: What are you doing? 
2079,"DOCTOR: Just checking up. Now then, where is the Nurse's original? "
2080,MEADOWS 2: It's in a panel in the wall somewhere. The control's in the
2081,couch there. 
2082,"DOCTOR: All right, Officer. "
2083,(The policeman releases Meadows 2 to operate the controls. The panel
2084,"slides back to reveal the real Nurse, wearing the white armband.) "
2085,SAMANTHA: Flipping heck. But she's in there! 
2086,"(In the main room, Pinto 2 has been washing her hands. There is a ray"
2087,"gun hidden in one of the towels and she uses it on the policeman, who"
2088,screams and dies. Then she goes into the x-ray room and aims it at
2089,Meadows 2.) 
2090,PINTO: You traitor! 
2091,SAMANTHA: Look out! 
2092,"(Before she can fire, Meadows leaps towards the real Nurse and touches"
2093,her armband. Pinto 2 dissolves into a shapeless blob.) 
2094,"DOCTOR: It's all right, Sam. It's all right. "
2095,SAMANTHA: She vanished! 
2096,MEADOWS 2: Doctor. 
2097,(The real nurse is waking up.) 
2098,DOCTOR: Put her on here. 
2099,(Meadows helps her onto a couch.) 
2100,MEADOWS 2: There we are. 
2101,DOCTOR: Will there be any permanent damage? 
2102,MEADOWS 2: No. You can take that off now. 
2103,(He takes off the nurse's armband.) 
2104,DOCTOR: It's all right. You'll be quite all right in a few minutes.
2105,There. 
2106,(The Doctor sees a pile of files on a table.) 
2107,"SAMANTHA: Doctor, what's happened to Jamie? "
2108,DOCTOR: What on Earth are these doing here? 
2109,"SAMANTHA: Doctor, Jamie wasn't anywhere near the kiosk the last time."
2110,"Look, you're not listening! I think they've got Jamie! "
2111,DOCTOR: Jamie! Where? 
2112,"SAMANTHA: Well, you should know. You got him to pinch me ticket. "
2113,DOCTOR: Pinch your ticket? 
2114,SAMANTHA: To stop me from going to Rome. 
2115,DOCTOR: Oh. You mean Jamie has 
2116,SAMANTHA: Has gone in my place. 
2117,"DOCTOR: First Polly and Ben, now Jamie. We've no time to lose. "

2119,
2120,"(Tied to a chair, Jamie is struggling to get free"
2121,when the door opens.) 
2122,JAMIE: Inspector! 
2123,CROSSLAND: Let's see if I can get you out of there. How did you get
2124,here? 
2125,(Crossland unties Jamie. He seems to have lost his accent somewhere.) 
2126,"JAMIE: I came on the plane, stole someone's ticket. "
2127,CROSSLAND: You ought to have been miniaturised on the journey. 
2128,JAMIE: Miniaturised? 
2129,"CROSSLAND: Reduced in size, like all the youngsters in these cabinets."
2130,Did you not have anything to eat or drink? 
2131,"JAMIE: No, I felt too ill. "
2132,CROSSLAND: That explains it. The food is the first part of the process.
2133,
2134,"JAMIE: Inspector, what is this place? "
2135,"CROSSLAND: A satellite, Jamie. A flying ship in space. These people are"
2136,from another planet. It seems the Doctor was right after all. Does
2137,anyone down there believe him yet? 
2138,"JAMIE: Oh, I'm not sure. I don't think so. "
2139,CROSSLAND: I suppose it is too much for them to believe. But surely the
2140,Doctor's convinced them that something is going on? 
2141,"JAMIE: Aye, I think maybe the Commandant. "
2142,"CROSSLAND: Yes, Jamie. "
2143,"JAMIE: Inspector, have you escaped or something? "
2144,CROSSLAND: No-one escapes from here. 
2145,"JAMIE: But the plane that comes here, well, it must go back to Earth."
2146,We could get on it. 
2147,CROSSLAND: The last plane to Earth is leaving now. They've just gone
2148,back to pick up their own people. 
2149,JAMIE: Surely the Doctor'll think of some way of rescuing us? 
2150,"CROSSLAND: Not this time, Jamie. This time he's up against a mind"
2151,superior even to his. The mind of the Director. 
2152,JAMIE: You mean someone clever than the Doctor? 
2153,CROSSLAND: The man in charge of this whole mission. 
2154,"JAMIE: You seem to know a lot about it, Inspector. "
2155,"CROSSLAND: Of course I do, Jamie. I am the Director. "
2156,"(The space doors open and the rocket shaped aeroplane comes out, to"
2157,descend to Earth.)
2158,
2159, [Air Traffic Control]
2160,
2161,COMMANDANT: And his is the bearing where the
2162,Chameleon plane vanished. I want to know if it reappears there. They've
2163,a flight due any minute. 
2164,"HESLINGTON: Very good, sir. "
2165,"COMMANDANT: Now then, Doctor. What's all this about personnel files? "
2166,DOCTOR: Over here. I'll show you. I found these in the Medical Centre.
2167,Records of twenty five people who work here. Each one of these has been
2168,taken over by Chameleons. 
2169,COMMANDANT: Right. I'll have them all under arrest within fifteen
2170,"minutes. Airport Police please. Now, look at this. "
2171,DOCTOR: What is it? 
2172,JEAN: Chameleon Air Schedules. 
2173,COMMANDANT: You see here? Their last flight of the season goes in an
2174,hour. Superintendent Reynolds please. 
2175,DOCTOR: The last flight? Well that's exactly why they mustn't be
2176,arrested. 
2177,COMMANDANT: Superintendent? Commandant here. 
2178,DOCTOR: Will you please listen to me! 
2179,"COMMANDANT: Will you hold on a moment, please? "
2180,DOCTOR: These people must not be arrested. 
2181,COMMANDANT: Why not? 
2182,"DOCTOR: Somewhere in outer space, there are fifty thousand young"
2183,"people, three of my friends amongst them, and somehow we've got to"
2184,"bring them back. I want to get on this last flight, which means the"
2185,Chameleons must think that everything is going according to plan. 
2186,HESLINGTON: Commandant? 
2187,"COMMANDANT: Reynolds, I'll call you back. Now what is it? "
2188,HESLINGTON: This blip. It's just appeared out of nowhere and it's
2189,coming this way. 
2190,"COMMANDANT: Right, well keep tracking them. It maybe the Chameleon"
2191,"plane returning. Now look here, Doctor. All very well talking about"
2192,"getting on that plane, but how? "
2193,"DOCTOR: At the moment, you look like a man called Meadows. Could you"
2194,shed that identity and become somebody else? 
2195,"MEADOWS: Yes. Yes, some of our people have been processed twice. "
2196,"DOCTOR: Good. Then in that case I shall pretend I am a Chameleon, and"
2197,get on board that way. 
2198,"COMMANDANT: But even if you get on that plane, what do you hope to do? "
2199,"DOCTOR: I don't know till I get to the satellite, and then I will have"
2200,"one card to play, and that's up to you Commandant. "
2201,COMMANDANT: What's that? 
2202,"DOCTOR: The people the Chameleons have taken over, the originals, are"
2203,hidden somewhere here in Gatwick Airport. You have got to find them. 
2204,"COMMANDANT: Of course, and get those fearful things off their arms. "
2205,"DOCTOR: No, no, no! Find them, by all means, but don't tamper with"
2206,those arm sheaths. Otherwise we lose our one threat. The one thing I
2207,may be able to bargain with. 
2208,"COMMANDANT: Yes, I see that. But I still don't see how you're going to"
2209,"get on that plane, let alone convince them that you're one of their"
2210,people. 
2211,DOCTOR: That will depend entirely on Nurse Pinto. 
2212,"COMMANDANT: Jean, get onto Superintendent Reynolds."

2216,"DOCTOR: Now, is everything clear? You're sure you"

2218,"PINTO: Yes, of course, but we've got to think of those young people. "
2219,(Blade enters with a briefcase.) 
2220,BLADE: How very convenient. Lock the door. 
2221,"PINTO: No, don't shoot! This is Meadows. He had to be re-processed. "
2222,BLADE: Why? 
2223,DOCTOR: The Doctor became too suspicious of me as Meadows. I was able
2224,to kidnap him. The rest is as you can see. 
2225,BLADE: A pity. It was useful having someone in Air Traffic Control. But
2226,then of course we have possession of the Doctor's brain. 
2227,DOCTOR: You think that will be useful? 
2228,BLADE: Undoubtedly. 
2229,DOCTOR: That means that you'll be taking us up to the satellite? 
2230,BLADE: I am taking everybody back to the satellite on the next plane.
2231,It's the last flight. Surely you haven't forgotten that? 
2232,DOCTOR: The re-processing. It's difficult to remember details. 
2233,"BLADE: Yes, of course, I understand. What have you done with his"
2234,original? 
2235,DOCTOR: In a safe place. 
2236,BLADE: Well it should be with the others. 
2237,DOCTOR: Tell me where that is and I'll have it transferred. 
2238,BLADE: There's no time for that now. Jenkins will see you through
2239,Immigration. We leave in fifteen minutes. 
2240,(Blade leaves.) 
2241,PINTO: Do you think we convinced him? 
2242,"DOCTOR: I don't know. However, we've got aboard that plane. Come on,"
2243,don't let's be late.

2247,They say the passengers are now boarding the Chameleon plane. 
2248,COMMANDANT: Did they see if the Doctor had got on board? 
2249,JEAN: Yes. He was with Nurse Pinto. All the passengers are adults and
2250,most of them have been identified as airport personnel. 
2251,HESLINGTON: Commandant. Chameleon plane's requesting clearance for
2252,start up. 
2253,"COMMANDANT: All right, Heslington, normal procedure. Give them"
2254,clearance. 
2255,"HESLINGTON: Chameleon 345, stand by for start temperature "
2256,(And the plane takes off. A little later.) 
2257,COMMANDANT: Yes. Now it's stationary. It must be ascending vertically. 
2258,"HESLINGTON: The blip's getting fainter, sir. That means he's rising"
2259,above our radar umbrella. 
2260,"COMMANDANT: (into phone) Ah Superintendent, the very man. "
2261,"HESLINGTON: Blip's just gone, sir. "
2262,"COMMANDANT: Now look, Reynolds. We've got to get every man of your"

2282,somewhere we'd never think of. 
2283,"COMMANDANT: We've got to think of it, Jean, wherever it is. The"

2315,DIRECTOR: One moment. What do you know about the Doctor? 
2316,JAMIE 2: He is not of this Earth or of this century. He has travelled
2317,through time and space. His knowledge is even greater than ours. 
2318,"BLADE: Director, this man is a danger to us. He should be destroyed. "

2398,personnel. 
2399,DIRECTOR: We're well ahead of schedule. We can wait. Proceed with the
2400,"processing. By the way, Captain Blade, congratulations on bringing this"
2401,man here. I personally will decide which of our people is to have his
2402,identity. 
2403,"DOCTOR: It'll be one of your friends, I've no doubt. It's"

2408,Detective Inspector Crossland is actually on board. But (to Blade)
2409,where's your original? (to Spencer) And where's yours?

2416,Director and that man over there whose originals are safe on board
2417,"here. And then there are people like you two, whose originals have been"
2418,"left behind at Gatwick airport. If they're tampered with, you're"

2430,"DOCTOR: Ah, that I can't tell you. But they'd been searching for some"
2431,time and just as I was about to board the aircraft I got a signal which
2432,meant that they'd been successful. Otherwise I wouldn't have come.

2661,JAMIE: How do you mean? 
2662,"DOCTOR: I'll explain to you one day. Well, come along out. You look"

2682,"BLADE: What will our future be, Doctor? "
2683,"DOCTOR: So long as you keep your side of the bargain, you may return to"

2686,of my own.
