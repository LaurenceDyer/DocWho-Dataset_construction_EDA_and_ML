21," (Mike Yates, former Captain with UNIT, strolls"
22,along by a field of cows.)

24, [Theatre]
25,
26," (It's cabaret time, but the Doctor and Brigadier"
27,don't appear to be having as much fun as the rest of the audience.) 
28,COMEDIAN : Here's a funny thing. Here's a funny thing. When
29,"Archimedes, you've heard of Archimedes, jumped out of his bath and ran"
30,"down the road without his clothes on, he didn't shout Eureka, he"
31,shouted I'm a streaker! 
32,(Groans all round the room.) 
33,"BRIGADIER: Look here, Doctor, this is a complete waste of time. "
34,"HOST : And now, ladies and gentlemen, the management takes great"
35,"pleasure in presenting to you that exotic Turkish delight of the east,"
36,Sherezadi! 
37,(This is not the act the Doctor was waiting for.) 
38, [Spiritual Retreat]
39,
40, (Yates has arrived at a red-brick building -
41,Tidmarsh Manor - in the middle of nowhere and gone inside. He wanders
42,"along a corridor and opens a door. Somewhere downstairs, people are"
43,chanting to cymbal accompaniment. He goes down the staircase and
44,listens.) 
45,ALL : Om. Om. Om. Om. Om. Om. Om. Om. Om.
46, [Cellar]
47,
48, (An ornate circular mandala design is on the
49,"floor, and five men are sitting cross-legged around it.) "
50,ALL: Om. 
51,LUPTON: Om mani 
52,ALL: Om. 
53,LUPTON: padme hum. 
54,ALL: Om. 
55,LUPTON: Om mani 
56,ALL: Om. 
57,LUPTON: padme hum. 
58,ALL: Om. 
59,LUPTON: Om mani 
60,ALL: Om.

62,ALL: Om.

66,ALL: Om. 
67,LUPTON: Om mani 
68,ALL: Om. 
69,LUPTON: padme hum. 
70,(And so on. If I keep typing that up we'll be here all day. It is
71,henceforth referred to as the chant. Mike peers around the out cellar
72,"door then quietly goes in as the chanting becomes more forceful,"
73,building up to something. A turquoise glow appears in the middle of the
74,"mandala. Moving forward, Mike walks into a spider's web. He recoils and"
75,"knocks a candlestick, then back up the stairs. The sound of his"
76,footsteps breaks the chant.

80, (The Brigadier liked the belly dancer.) 
81,"DOCTOR: Well, you enjoyed that. "
82,"BRIGADIER: Extraordinary muscular control. Very fit, that girl. I must"
83,adapt some of those movements as exercises for the men. 
84,DOCTOR: They'd take some adapting. 
85,"HOST : And now, ladies and gentlemen, a slight contrast. That mind"
86,"reader extraordinaire, Professor Herbert Clegg! "
87,DOCTOR: This is what we came for. 
88,BRIGADIER: And about time. 
89, [Cellar]
90,
91, BARNES: Shall we carry on? 
92,"LUPTON: No, no, no, no. It's too late now. We'll try again tomorrow."
93,Are you sure you saw nothing? 
94,"BARNES: Oh, it was the wind. Someone left the door open. "
95,LUPTON: Listen. 
96,BARNES: It's a car. 
97,(The exhaust note recedes into the distance.) 
98,"LUPTON: Well, there's only one car here. The car belonging to our new"
99,"friend, Mister Yates."

101, [UNIT Laboratory]
102,
103,(The Brigadier escorts in a bearded man in cape and
104,fedora.) 
105,"DOCTOR: Ah, Professor Clegg. How good of you to come. "
106,"CLEGG: To be honest, I'm not quite sure why I have come. Your message"
107,was somewhat ambiguous. 
108,"DOCTOR: Yes, It's my fault entirely. I do apologise. Won't you sit"
109,down? 
110,"CLEGG: Thank you. You, er, you want me to do my act for you? Some sort"
111,"of regimental guest night, is it? Cabaret? I do a lot of dinners. "
112,"BRIGADIER: Lord, no. But clever stuff, mind you, but not really my cup"
113,of tea. 
114,"CLEGG: Oh, then, er, what exactly is it you want of me, gentlemen? "
115,"DOCTOR: Well, you see, Professor, I'm doing a little research into ESP."
116,
117,"BRIGADIER: That's extra sensory perception, you know. "
118,"CLEGG: Ah, yes, as a matter of actual fact, I did know that. "
119,"BRIGADIER: Oh, really? Well, I can't say that I did until the Doctor"
120,explained this morning. 
121,"DOCTOR: You see, Professor, my particular field covers, er,"
122,"psycholotry, telepathy and clairvoyance as well, so I thought perhaps"
123,you might be able to help me. 
124,"CLEGG: Oh. Well, you see, I'm afraid I can't, dearly as I'd like to. "
125,"DOCTOR: You disappoint me, Professor. "
126,"CLEGG: Well, there you are, that's just it. I'm, er. Well, I'm not a"
127,"professor at all. That's just for, er, well, you know, professional"
128,"purposes, do you see? "
129,BRIGADIER: You're trying to tell us that it was all a lot of tricks. 
130,"CLEGG: Well, er, not to put too fine a point on it, yes. "
131,"DOCTOR: Just a word code with your assistant, eh? "
132,"CLEGG: Ah. Very perspicacious of you, Doctor. I feel sure that my"
133,secret is safe with you. 
134,"DOCTOR: Oh, indeed it is, Professor. Indeed it is. "
135,CLEGG: Thank you. 
136,DOCTOR: I assure you that I shall tell nobody that you are really a
137,very powerful clairvoyant. 
138,CLEGG: I beg your pardon? 
139,"DOCTOR: That's your real secret, isn't it? "
140,CLEGG: Why ever should you think that? 
141,"DOCTOR: You made a couple of mistakes last night, Professor. You gave"
142,the answer before your assistant had uttered a word. 
143,CLEGG: Oh. It's happening more and more. I don't want it to! I was
144,"quite happy as a performer, Doctor, but I seem to be developing this,"
145,"this power! Oh, I hate it. I hate it. The things I can make happen. "
146,"DOCTOR: Physical manifestations? Psychokinesis, for example? "
147,"CLEGG: Well, yes. "
148,DOCTOR: That's remarkable. 
149,BRIGADIER: Would you mind explaining? 
150,CLEGG: Psychokinesis? Moving things by the power of the mind. 
151,DOCTOR: A very rarely developed faculty in homo sapiens. Professor?
152,Mister Clegg. Would you give us a demonstration? 
153,"CLEGG: Well, er. "
154,DOCTOR: Please? 
155,"CLEGG: Oh, very well. "
156,"(Clegg concentrates on a tray over on a desk, with a plate and plastic"
157,"cup on it. Gently, it rises into the air and moves towards him.) "
158,"CLEGG: I can't, I can't keep it up. "
159,(The tray clatters to the floor at the Brigadier's feet.) 
160,BRIGADIER: You ought to use that in your act. 
161,CLEGG: And lose my sanity? It would be a poor exchange. 
162,"DOCTOR: Mister Clegg, your powers may seem to be extraordinary, but I"
163,assure you that they lie dormant in everyone. They're perfectly
164,natural. 
165,CLEGG: I find that very difficult to believe. 
166,"DOCTOR: But that's what my experiment's are all about, Mister Clegg. "
167,"CLEGG: You mean, you mean you can find out why I'm different? "
168,DOCTOR: Possibly. 
169,"CLEGG: Then I. Very well, I'll help you all I can. "
170,DOCTOR: Good.

172, [Spiritual Retreat]
173,
174, (Lupton follows an oriental man down the main
175,staircase.) 
176,"LUPTON: Not only a journalist, but a woman journalist. We do not want"
177,her here. 
178,"CHO-JE: We cannot shut out the world entirely, my brother. "
179,"LUPTON: Why not? You used to, in Tibet. "
180,"CHO-JE: All things pass away, as you will learn in your meditation."
181,"This world of samsara, the world of appearance, is the world of change."
182,
183,"LUPTON: Yes, but "
184, [Sitting room]
185,
186, LUPTON: I came here to get away from the world. So
187,did the others. We came here to find solitude. 
188,CHO-JE: One day you will learn to walk in solitude amidst the traffic
189,of the world. 
190,LUPTON: It's still not too late to stop her coming. 
191,CHO-JE: But it is. Mister Yates has already gone to the station to
192,fetch her. 
193,(Cho-Je spins a prayer wheel and goes through an inner door.)
194,
195, [Mortimer Railway Station]
196,
197, (Mike has met Sarah off the train at Stratfield
198,"Mortimer, and they get into his sporty little open top two seater.) "
199,SARAH: What's it all about? 
200,(He just drives them away.)
201,
202, [Spiritual Retreat]
203,
204, LUPTON: Of course it's no accident. We heard his
205,"car last night, didn't we? He's bringing her here because he suspects"
206,something. 
207,"BARNES: We'll just have to stop for a while, that's all. "
208,LUPTON: Stop? Now? On the point of breakthrough? The power in that
209,circle last night 
210,"TOMMY: Hello, Lupton. "
211,(A man in a woollen jumper is holding out a flower.) 
212,TOMMY: Look. 
213,LUPTON: Mister Lupton. 
214,TOMMY: Huh? Yeah. Mister. Look. Pretty. 
215,"BARNES: Go and get on with your work, Tommy. You're not wanted here. "
216,"TOMMY: Finished weeding. Look, Barnes. Pretty flower. "
217,"BARNES: Yes, I can see. Now go and find something else to do, will you?"
218,
219,"TOMMY: Going to have a cuppa. Er, you like a cuppa? Er, you like a"
220,"cuppa, mister? "
221,BARNES: For pity's sake! 
222,"(Barnes pushes Tommy away, and he falls backwards onto the carpet.) "
223,LUPTON: Get the others together. There's no time to be lost. 
224,(Lupton and Barnes leave. Tommy discovers that he has crushed his
225,flower when he fell.) 
226,TOMMY: Pretty flower. Poor pretty.
227,
228, [Road]
229,
230, (Driving along.) 
231,SARAH: It's a nice day. 
232,"MIKE: Yes, isn't it. "
233,"SARAH: Oh, come on, Mike. Out with it. "
234,MIKE: Hmm? 
235,SARAH: What is it all about? 
236,MIKE: I told you. It's a great story for that magazine of yours. 
237,SARAH: A couple of refugee Tibetan monks setting up a lamasery in
238,darkest mummerset? 
239,MIKE: It's not a lamasery. It's a meditation centre. 
240,"SARAH: Okay, so maybe meditation's the in-thing. Maybe I can sell it to"
241,"Percy. I still want to know what it's all about. Look, you'd better"
242,"start at the beginning. I mean, what are you doing here anyway? "
243,"MIKE: Trying to sort myself out, I suppose, after that golden age mess."
244,
245,SARAH: Ah. 
246,"MIKE: I mean, like you said, everybody's going on about meditation of"
247,"one sort or another, so I thought I'd have a crack at it. Then I saw in"
248,the paper about these two Tibetans. 
249,(The group are back around the mandala doing the Om Mani padme hum
250,chant again.) 
251,"SARAH: Well, it sounds to me as if these people are just getting on"
252,"with their meditation. You know, doing a bit of homework. "
253,"MIKE: Then why be so secret about it? No, they're up to something. I"
254,"think they're in touch with some. Oh, I don't know, some power. It's"
255,definitely a job for UNIT. 
256,"SARAH: Well, then, you must tell the Brig or the Doctor. "
257,MIKE: And you think they'd believe me? Last time we met I pulled a gun
258,on them. 
259,"SARAH: Oh, now I get it! "
260,"(The chanting builds up to a peak, and we zoom in on Lupton.) "
261,"SARAH: So, you want me to have a look round and then tell the Brig for"
262,you? 
263,MIKE: That's the general idea. 
264,SARAH: Hmm. 
265,MIKE: Please? 
266,SARAH: Okay. 
267,"MIKE: Bless you, Sarah Jane. "
268,SARAH: You'll have to convince me though. 
269,MIKE: Don't you worry. 
270,(There is a tractor dead ahead. Mike slams on the brakes as Sarah puts
271,"up her arms to shield her face. They swerve off the road, which is now"
272,completely empty.) 
273,MIKE: There's nothing there. 
274,SARAH: So you did see it? 
275,MIKE: The tractor? Of course. 
276,SARAH: I'm convinced.
277,
278, [UNIT Laboratory]
279,
280, (The Doctor is wiring up a pair of oversized
281,headphones that Clegg is wearing to a monitor.) 
282,"DOCTOR: You see, Brigadier, the electrocephalograph will show us his"
283,"brainwaves on here as we carry out the tests. Right, let's try a little"
284,"simple psycholotry, shall we? Er, Lethbridge Stewart, my dear fellow,"
285,would you like to give Mister Clegg some little article of yours? 
286,"BRIGADIER: What? Oh. Yes, yes, rather. "
287,(The Brigadier takes off his wrist watch.) 
288,BRIGADIER: Here. 
289,"DOCTOR: Right. Ready when you are, Mister Clegg. "
290,CLEGG: This watch was given to you eleven years ago. You received it in
291,"a hotel. A hotel by the sea. Brighton, was it? From a young lady called"
292,Doris. She said it was to mark her gratitude to you 
293,"BRIGADIER: Yes, all true, absolutely spot on. "
294,(The Brigadier takes back his watch rather quickly.) 
295,"BRIGADIER: Surely you've got enough, Doctor? "
296,"DOCTOR: A little too much perhaps, eh, Alastair? "
297,(The Doctor moves a large modified salon hairdryer over Clegg's head.) 
298,"DOCTOR: Right, this is what we call the IRIS machine, or Image"
299,Reproduction Integrating System. It translates your thoughts into
300,"pictures on this monitor here. Try this, will you? "
301,"(The Doctor hands Clegg his sonic screwdriver. As he handles it, the"
302,"screen shows one Drashig, then three, then the Doctor using the"
303,screwdriver to ignite the marsh gas to kill them.)
304,
305, [Sitting room]
306,
307, (Sarah is taking down shorthand as Mike sits in on
308,the interview.) 
309,CHO-JE: We can but point a finger along the way. A man must go inside
310,"and face his fears and hopes, his hates and his loves, and watch them"
311,"wither away. Then he will find his true self, which is no self. He will"
312,"see his true mind, which is no mind. "
313,SARAH: And that's what meditation's all about? 
314,CHO-JE: Yes! The old man must die and the new man will discover to his
315,inexpressible joy that he has never existed. 
316,"SARAH: Well, good luck, mate. "
317,MIKE: I think I'm going to need it. 
318,"SARAH: But if you do start ferreting about in your subconscious, aren't"
319,"you going to turn up all sorts of nasties? I mean, complexes, phobias"
320,and what have you? 
321,"CHO-JE: Of course, the demons and the divinities. But in our way, the"
322,"Vajrayana Way, we use the powers to help us. If we will excuse me, it's"
323,time for the meditation class. 
324,"MIKE: But couldn't that be dangerous? If these, these powers were used"
325,wrongly. 
326,"CHO-JE: It could be so, yes. By evil men in their ignorance and"
327,"craving, it could indeed be most dangerous. "
328,MIKE: I see. 
329,CHO-JE: Such a thing could never happen here.
330,
331, [UNIT Laboratory]
332,
333," CLEGG: I'm sorry. I, I saw, well, just fantasies. "
334,"BRIGADIER: Don't worry, Professor. You're doing very well. "
335,"DOCTOR: Indeed you are, Professor. Indeed you are. "
336,(The Doctor takes back his screwdriver.) 
337,"DOCTOR: Now, er, do you feel up to bending the odd fork? "
338,(Benton enters with a package.) 
339,"BENTON: Doctor, I. Ah, doing a bit of hairdressing on the side, eh? "
340,BRIGADIER: Benton. 
341,"BENTON: Sorry, sir. I didn't see you there. "
342,BRIGADIER: What do you want? 
343,"BENTON: Well, this package, sir. It's just arrived by express post. I"
344,thought it may be urgent. 
345,"BRIGADIER: Well, for the Doctor or for me? "
346,"BENTON: Well, that's just it. It's addressed to the Doctor or Brigadier"
347,"Lethbridge Stewart or Captain Yates or, er, Sergeant Benton. It's from"
348,"South America, sir. "
349,"DOCTOR: What, from Jo? "
350,BENTON: I reckon so. 
351,"DOCTOR: Well, let's take a look. "
352,(The Doctor is about to open the package when he stops.) 
353,"DOCTOR: Oh, no, wait a minute. I've got a better idea. Er, Mister"
354,"Clegg, would you like to tell us what's inside this package? "
355,CLEGG: This has come a long way. 
356,"BRIGADIER: Yes, of course, from the Amazon. Sergeant Benton just told"
357,you. 
358,"DOCTOR: Brigadier, please. "
359,"CLEGG: From beyond the stars. Could it be a meteorite? Oh, it's"
360,beautiful. A gemstone. A blue jewel. 
361,"BRIGADIER: Lord, not that stone of yours? "
362,"DOCTOR: The crystal from Metebelis Three. Thank you, Mister Clegg."
363,"Let's take a look, shall we? "
364,(The Doctor opens the package and takes out the large stone.) 
365,"DOCTOR: Well, well, well."
366, [Spiritual Retreat]
367,
368, (Mike has given Sarah the tour and ended up
369,outside a door marked Meditation Room.) 
370,MIKE: And that that's about it. 
371,"SARAH: Where is everybody, though? "
372,"MIKE: In there, most of them. "
373,"SARAH: Well, that's more like it. Can I have a look? "
374,"MIKE: Well, I don't think. "
375,"SARAH: Now, that sweet little lama said to show me everything, didn't"
376,he? 
377,"MIKE: Yes, but he didn't mean you to "
378,"SARAH: Well, come on then. "
379,"MIKE: All right, but for heaven's sake be quiet. "
380,SARAH: Shush.
381,
382, [Meditation room]
383,
384, (A different chant is going on here as the
385,students sit cross-legged in two rows facing each other. The sound is
386,coming from a reel to reel tape recorder. Mike and Sarah watch from the
387,doorway.) 
388,MIKE: (sotto) It helps with the meditation. 
389,SARAH: (sotto) What are they meditating about? 
390,"MIKE: (sotto) Not about anything. They're just meditating, watching. "
391,SARAH: (sotto) So what are they watching? 
392,MIKE: (sotto) They're mentally watching their tummies go up and down as
393,they breathe. 
394,SARAH: (sotto) Like contemplating their belly buttons. 
395,MIKE: (sotto) You could put it like that. Come on. 
396, [Spiritual Retreat]
397,
398," SARAH: Well, I hope you all know what you're on"
399,about. 
400,MIKE: It probably seems a bit daft. 
401,SARAH: Oh. 
402,"MIKE: It's an exercise in awareness, really. Hey, come on. It's time we"
403,hid in the cellar. 
404,SARAH: Oh! Right. 
405,(Mike and Sarah walk around a corner.) 
406,"LUPTON: Good afternoon, my brother. "
407,(Barnes is standing behind Lupton.) 
408,MIKE: Good afternoon. 
409,SARAH: Ahem. 
410,"MIKE: Oh, this is Sarah Jane Smith. She works for Metropolitan. You"
411,"know, the magazine. "
412,"LUPTON: Yes, I know. Cho-Je mentioned that you would be coming. "
413,MIKE: Did he? When? 
414,LUPTON: This afternoon. I trust you had an informative visit? 
415,"SARAH: Oh, er, yes. Yes, thank you. Most pleasant. Well, after a bad"
416,"start, that is. "
417,LUPTON: A bad start? 
418,"SARAH: Yes, well, Mike and I were driving down the road "
419,"MIKE: Oh, we had a little accident. "
420,SARAH: Accident? 
421,(Mike pinches Sarah's arm.) 
422,SARAH: Ah. 
423,MIKE: The car ran off the road. 
424,LUPTON: You were lucky to escape. The roads round here can be very
425,dangerous. Very dangerous indeed. 
426,MIKE: I take your point. 
427,LUPTON: Good. You must stay and share our meal with us. 
428,"SARAH: Oh, great. "
429,MIKE: I'm afraid there won't be time. 
430,"LUPTON: Well, at least have a cup of tea. "
431,"SARAH: Oh, now you're talking. "
432,"MIKE: Er, no. Unfortunately Miss Smith has to leave right away. "
433,SARAH: But I 
434,MIKE: If you don't go now you'll miss your train. 
435,(Mike drags Sarah along the corridor.) 
436,SARAH: We've got hours yet. 
437,MIKE: I think you must have mis-read your timetable. 
438,SARAH: Oh. Excuse me.
439,
440, [Outside the Spiritual Retreat]
441,
442,(They go over to Mike's car and get in.) 
443,"SARAH: Look, I just don't understand you. You said you want me to see"
444,for myself and then you suddenly take off. 
445,[Spiritual Retreat]
446,
447, LUPTON: I don't think we shall have any more
448,trouble. That young man's scared out of his wits. Warn the others. We
449,carry on as planned.
450,
451, [Mike's car] 
452," SARAH: Look, what's it all about? "
453,MIKE: That was Lupton. 
454,"SARAH: Well. Oh, so that's why you pinched me. I'll be bruised for a"
455,week. 
456,MIKE: You heard what he said. He'd been told you were coming. 
457,SARAH: So? 
458,MIKE: Well don't you see? He must have been responsible for that
459,"hallucination, that non-existent tractor. He tried to kill us. "
460,(Mike stops the car just outside the Lamasery grounds.) 
461,SARAH: So why are we running away? 
462,MIKE: We're not. We're letting him think we're running away. Now we'll
463,go back on foot. 
464,SARAH: The fiendish cunning of the man. 
465,(They climb over the wall a short way from the main gate.)
466,
467, [UNIT Laboratory]

471,"twenty ninth. Switch on the light for me, Sergeant, will you? "
472,BENTON: All right. 
473,"DOCTOR: We haven't found our toadstool yet, and we're not likely to if"
474,"I don't get rid of this crystal. You see, the Indian porters say it's"
475,"bad magic. Like it goes or they go. So, Doctor, if you're away on a"
476,"cheap day trip to Mars, perhaps you could look after it for me,"
477,"Brigadier? Or if you're away in Geneva, how about it, Mike? Or my"
478,lovely Sergeant Benton? (Clegg has picked up the crystal.)

486,TOMMY: Play games? 
487,"MIKE: That's right, just playing a little game. "
488,"TOMMY: Tom likes games. Tom play game too? SARAH: Er, tell you what,"

490,TOMMY: Who are you? 
491,SARAH: My name is Sarah. Sarah Jane Smith. 
492,"TOMMY: Tom likes you, Sarah Jane Smith. "
493,"SARAH: Oh, you see, Tom, this game, it's called secrets. And its a"
494,secret that I'm here. Shush. 
495,TOMMY: Shush. 
496,"SARAH: Yeah. So you won't tell anyone, will you? "
497,"TOMMY: Ah, that's pretty. "
498,SARAH: Would you like it?

526,(The letter suddenly flies out of the Doctor's hands and the whole
527,place shakes. Glassware falls off shelves and pieces of paper fly
528,around. Lupton and his cabal continue their chanting. The Doctor fights
529,against an unseen force or wind to try and reach Clegg and the crystal.
530,He manages to grab it from the clairvoyant's hand. Clegg cries out in
531,pain then stops dead.)

556,"BRIGADIER: Well, he was looking at it when he died. "
557,(Benton enters.) 
558,"BENTON: The police have gone, sir. The Inspector said he'd give you a"
559,ring later. 
560,"BRIGADIER: Right. Thank you, Benton. "
561,DOCTOR: Wait a minute. Now there is a chance. 
562,BRIGADIER: A chance of what? 
563,"DOCTOR: Well, Professor Clegg was attached to this IRIS machine when he"
564,died. Perhaps it recorded his thoughts. 
565,(The Doctor rewinds a tape then switches on the monitor. The image is
566,an arachnophobe's worst nightmare.)

580,"BENTON: Well, what's that, Doctor? "
581,DOCTOR: I must look into the crystal myself. 
582,"BRIGADIER: Isn't that rather dangerous? I mean, look what happened last"
583,time. 
584,"DOCTOR: I'll bear it in mind, Brigadier. "
585,"BENTON: Er, Doctor? "
586,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
587,"BENTON: Well, wouldn't it be best for me to have a go first? I mean,"

596,better you go by yourself. Let the Doc and the Brig know what's going
597,on. 
598,"SARAH: (sotto) Okay. Hey, Mike? "
599,MIKE: (sotto) What? 
600,SARAH: (sotto) I don't know what is going on. 
601,MIKE: (sotto) Just tell them everything you saw. Off you go. 
602,"SARAH: (sotto) Well, what are you going to do? "
603,"MIKE: (sotto) I'm going to try and get into the Abbot, tell him all"
604,about it. 
605,SARAH: (sotto) Do be careful.

608,BARNES : I still don't understand what happened. 
609,(Mike leaves.) 
610,LUPTON: I'm only just beginning to understand myself. 
611,"BARNES: And, that spider, what was it? One of those Tibetan demons"
612,Cho-je warned us about? 
613,"LUPTON: Well, that's what he would say, but he'd be wrong. "
614,BARNES: Where did it go? 
615,LUPTON: It didn't. It's still here. 
616,BARNES: Still there? Do you mean you can still feel it on your back? 
617,LUPTON: Our minds are joined together. If I concentrate I can hear it
618,speaking to me. 
619,SPIDER : This man is stupid. Send him away. 
620,LUPTON: Very well. 
621,BARNES: Was it speaking to you then? 
622,LUPTON: It was. 
623,BARNES: What did it say? 
624,LUPTON: It said you looked tired and you should be in bed. 
625,BARNES: I'll never be able to sleep a wink. To think I came here to get
626,peace of mind. 
627,"LUPTON: Look, I'll see you in the morning. And don't worry. I know what"

631,"SPIDER : The crystal. I can feel it. Concentrate, Lupton."
632,Concentrate! 
633,LUPTON: What crystal? 
634,SPIDER : It is why I have come. To find the crystal and get it
635,"back. It will give us power, the power we both seek. Concentrate! "
636,LUPTON: I can see a man staring into a blue light. The light of a
637,crystal. A blue crystal.

644,(Benton enters with a cup on a tray.) 
645,"BRIGADIER: Oh, there you are. Looks as if we have an emergency on our"

647,along. 
648,(The Brigadier picks up a phone.) 
649,"BRIGADIER: Give me the M.O. Quickly. Oh, is that you, Sullivan? Get"
650,over to the lab straight away.

654,"DOCTOR: Oh, the smell of that coffee. Thank you, Sergeant. "
655,"BRIGADIER: Forget it, Sullivan. "
656,"DOCTOR: You know, I've always said that next to Mrs Samuel Pepys you"
657,make the finest cup of coffee in the world. 
658,"BENTON: Thank you very much, Doctor. Actually the secret of it is, is"
659,to get the water 
660,"BRIGADIER: Yeah. Look, never mind the dratted coffee. What about the"
661,spiders? 
662,DOCTOR: Spiders? 
663,BRIGADIER: The ones in the crystal. 
664,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. You know, Brigadier, when I was a young man, there was"
665,an old hermit who lived half way up a mountain just behind our house. I
666,spent some of the finest hours of my life with that old man. 
667,BRIGADIER: What are you talking about? 
668,DOCTOR: And it was from him I first learnt how to look into my mind. 
669,"BRIGADIER: The crystal, Doctor. "
670,"DOCTOR: That's what I'm trying to tell you, Brigadier. When I looked"
671,"into that crystal, all I could see was the face of my old teacher. "

700,"DOCTOR: Of course I'm listening, Sarah. Go on. What happened next? "
701,"SARAH: Well, then we climbed in the window, you see, and went straight"
702,down to the cellar. 
703,DOCTOR: Hmm mmm. 
704,"SARAH: Oh, no, not straight down, because of Tommy. Oh, but he's not"
705,"really mixed up in this. At least, I suppose he isn't. "
706,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's fascinating. "
707,SARAH: Hmm? 
708,DOCTOR: The crystal lattice is equally balanced from right to left.
709,It's remarkable. 
710,"SARAH: You see, you're not listening to a word! "
711,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course I am. You went down into the cellar to see if"
712,"Tommy was still there, right? "
713,"SARAH: Half right. Oh please, do try to pay attention, Doctor? "
714,"DOCTOR: Probably analogous to the laser. Well, go on! I'm listening. "
715,"SARAH: Right. So, there they all were in the cellar, chanting away like"
716,billy-o. And all of a sudden this giant spider appeared and jumped on
717,Lupton's back! 
718,DOCTOR: It's coherent thought. 
719,"SARAH: Oh, Doctor, really! "
720,DOCTOR: A scientific pun. What did you say? 
721,"SARAH: I said really. This is important, but you're so interested in"
722,that wretched 
723,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, before that. What did you say before that? Did you"
724,say spider? 
725,SARAH: That's right.

737,"LUPTON: No, no, no, no. The other Doctor. "

751,SARAH: Where did the crystal come from anyway? 
752,"DOCTOR: Oh, I brought it back some time ago from a planet called"
753,Metebelis Three. 
754,SARAH: I've never heard of it. 
755,"DOCTOR: Oh, you wouldn't have done. It's also called the blue planet"
756,"because the moonlight is blue, you see? "
757,SARAH: Oh. And did you just happen to stumble across the planet and
758,"find this crystal, accidental like? "
759,"DOCTOR: No, I went there deliberately to fetch it. It has strange"
760,"properties, a Metebelis crystal. It can affect the mind. "
761,SARAH: The mind? You mean it could drive someone mad? 
762,"DOCTOR: No, just the opposite usually. It clears the mind and amplifies"
763,its power. 
764,SARAH: But it could be used for evil purposes? 
765,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, of course, if the mind operating it was motivated by"
766,evil. 
767,"SARAH: So, if the giant spiders on Metebelis Three wanted that crystal"

932,fuel.
933,
934, [Gyrocopter]
935,
936, SPIDER : We must return to the ground. There
937,is very little liquid left to burn. 
938,LUPTON: You mean we've got no fuel? 
939,SPIDER : We have enough.
940,
941, [Space car] 
942," DOCTOR: Right, here we go. Coming in to land. "
943,"(Lupton has already landed in a field, and run down to the nearby River"
944,"Severn. The Doctor lands, and he and Sarah run off.)"
945,
946, [Mooring]
947,
948,(Lupton slithers down to where an old barge is
949,"propped up on the river bank, and sees a man mooring a small motor"
950,boat. Then a tiny hovercraft rushes up onto the bank. The man calls out
951,to its pilot.) 
952,"MAN: Fantastic, Mister Hopkins. If I had enough money, I'd buy twenty"
953,of them. 
954,HOPKINS: Look out! 
955,(Lupton pushes the man into the river and tries to relaunch his boat.) 
956,HOPKINS: Hey! 
957,(Hopkins gets zapped. The Doctor and Sarah arrive to see the boat out
958,"in the river, and its owner trying to climb back on board. They go to"
959,the hovercraft. Lupton finally gets the motorboat started.) 
960,MAN: Come back! 
961,(The Doctor gives chase although he isn't quite as manoeuvrable and has
962,to use the shore to do a turn at one point. Lupton carries on down
963,river and the Doctor makes for the opposite bank.)
964,
965,[Boat]
966,
967, LUPTON: We've lost him! 
968,(The Doctor is cutting across a large oxbow by land and flies straight
969,over a tramp who has just laid down for a sleep. He rejoins the river
970,in the little boat's wake.) 
971,LUPTON: He'll catch us! 
972,SPIDER : I'll get help from Metebelis. Concentrate! Concentrate! 
973,(The hovercraft comes alongside and the Doctor jumps into the boat. But
974,Lupton has vanished!) 
975, Part Three
976,
977, [Spiritual Retreat]
978,
979, (Tommy comes out of the cupboard under the stairs
980,and looks around the corner to see Lupton materialising.) 
981,TOMMY: Clever Lupton. 
982,(Lupton takes the Metebelis crystal out of his jacket pocket.) 
983,TOMMY: Pretty. 
984,(Tommy backs away as Cho-Je enters the hallway.) 
985,CHO-JE: Mister Lupton. 
986,(Cho-Je passes Tommy's hiding place and goes into a room. Lupton checks
987,"that Cho-Je is out of sight and leaves, followed carefully by Tommy.)"
988,
989, [Lupton's room]
990,
991, (A basic lodger's room.) 
992,LUPTON: We've done it. 
993,"SPIDER : Yes, we've done it. Together. "
994,LUPTON: Will this give us power? 
995,SPIDER : More power than you dared to dream of. Veil your mind! You
996,"must cloak your ambition. I can understand it, perhaps I share it, but"
997,if my sisters on Metebelis Three were to have an inkling of your
998,"thoughts, they would kill you. Beware! They seek to make the link."
999,
1000, [Spider's Council Chamber]
1001,
1002,(Lupton's face is half seen. It is a mental link
1003,only and he has not been teleported there.) 
1004,QUEEN: We are successful? 
1005,SPIDER: Totally. The crystal is ours. 
1006,QUEEN: You have done well. 
1007,"SPIDER : I thank you, O Queen. "
1008,"QUEEN: Now you must prepare to return, bringing the crystal with you. "
1009,SPIDER : It shall be done. 
1010,LUPTON: What about me? I am to be forgotten? 
1011,QUEEN: You are not necessary! 
1012,"LUPTON: Oh, but I am. Without me, you would never have recovered your"
1013,precious crystal. I've been your friend. 
1014,QUEEN: A friend? A two leg dares to claim friendship with the eight
1015,"legs, the noble ones? "
1016,"SPIDER : He means no harm, O Queen, and it is true that he has"
1017,served us well. 
1018,QUEEN: Very well. His reward will be to serve us further. We could use
1019,"him in the great work, the conquest of Earth. "
1020,SPIDER : Conquest? 
1021,QUEEN: This is the secret purpose of the Great One. 
1022,COUNCIL: All praise to the Great One! 
1023,QUEEN: That is why she requires the crystal. We shall return to our
1024,"rightful home, Earth, as rulers. We have exhausted our power. Be ready"
1025,to return. Be ready.
1026,
1027, [Lupton's room]
1028,
1029, (Lupton opens the window and breathes deeply.) 
1030,"SPIDER : Rest now. Let the power return to your body, and to your"
1031,mind. 
1032,(Lupton collapses onto his bed.) 
1033,"SPIDER : Sleep, Lupton, sleep. "
1034,"(The Spider appears, leaves Lupton's back crosses the floor. It"
1035,vanishes then reappears in the corridor outside.)
1036,
1037, [Sitting room]
1038,
1039," (Cho-Je is entertaining guests - the Doctor, Sarah"
1040,and Mike.) 
1041,CHO-JE: I can understand your distress at losing a valuable piece of
1042,"equipment, er, Doctor? However, I feel you are mistaken in suggesting"
1043,that Mister Lupton had anything to do with it. 
1044,"(Barnes has overheard enough, and leaves.) "
1045,SARAH: But I saw him. I recognised him. 
1046,CHO-JE: When? How far away from here? 
1047,"DOCTOR: Oh, about eighty miles, I should say. "
1048,SARAH: And we lost sight of him at about half past ten or thereabouts. 
1049,CHO-JE: At half past ten I was walking to the meditation class and I
1050,saw Mister Lupton in the corridor. 
1051,"MIKE: But, but, that's impossible. "
1052,CHO-JE: Precisely. So one of us is mistaken. You cannot believe he was
1053,transported here in the winking of an eye. 
1054,"DOCTOR: No, no, of course not. "
1055,"MIKE: Well, stranger things have happened. "
1056,SARAH: You can say that again. 
1057,MIKE: Much stranger. 
1058,(The Spider approaches the open door.) 
1059,"CHO-JE: As we both know, such things are child's play to a master of"
1060,"sorcerer, but you cannot believe that Mister Lupton is a sorcerer. We"
1061,"have no magicians here, I do assure you."
1062,
1063, [Lupton's room]
1064,
1065," BARNES: Lupton. Lupton, wake up. Wake up! "
1066,LUPTON: What is it? 
1067,BARNES: That girl's back. She's brought somebody with her called the
1068,Doctor. 
1069,LUPTON: Has she indeed? 
1070,BARNES: Now they're saying that you. 
1071,(Lupton is holding the crystal.) 
1072,"BARNES: Then it's true. Lupton, we've got to stop this. We're meddling"
1073,in things we don't understand. 
1074,LUPTON: Are we now. 
1075,BARNES: Now listen to me. Is that thing on your back at this moment? 
1076,"LUPTON: How very strange. No, it's not. "
1077,"BARNES: Right, let's get away from here. Now, while the going's good. "
1078,"LUPTON: Barnes, do you know why I came to this place? "
1079,"BARNES: No, not really. "
1080,(Lupton puts the crystal on the desk and goes to wash his face.) 
1081,"LUPTON: All right. Potted history coming up. Picture me, bright young"
1082,"salesman. Salesman of the year, Sales Manager, Sales Director. I gave"
1083,them twenty five years of my life! Are you with me so far? 
1084,"BARNES: Yes, yes. "
1085,"LUPTON: Then the finance boys moved in. Merger, takeover, golden"
1086,"handshake. Me, out on the streets. I could even have taken that, but"
1087,"when I tried to set up of my own, they deliberately, cold bloodedly"
1088,broke me. 
1089,"(Tommy has appeared at the open window. He spots the crystal, reaches"
1090,in and takes it.) 
1091,LUPTON: I'm still looking for some of the bits. 
1092,BARNES: So you came here to get peace of mind? 
1093,LUPTON: Ha! I came here to get power. Do you think I'm going to let go
1094,"now when it's in sight, when I can see myself taking over that firm,"
1095,"taking over the country, the entire stinking world. I want to see them"
1096,"grovel, I want to see them breaking their hearts, I want to see them"
1097,eating dirt. 
1098,BARNES: I came here just to look for peace of mind.
1099,
1100, [Tommy's cupboard]
1101,
1102, (Tommy goes into his secret place and switches on
1103,the light. He takes a shoe box out of an old suitcase.) 
1104,"TOMMY: Ah, pretty. "
1105,(He puts the crystal in the box with all the other shiny objects he's
1106,obtained.) 
1107,TOMMY: All Tommy's pretties.
1108,
1109,[Lupton's room]
1110,
1111, BARNES: So what are we going to do? 
1112,"LUPTON: When I've learned how to use that crystal, I shan't need the"
1113,spiders anymore. 
1114,(The Spider materialises.) 
1115,"BARNES: Lupton, look! "
1116,SPIDER: Your master will come to fetch you soon. 
1117,LUPTON: My master? You mean Cho-Je? Why? 
1118,SPIDER: To talk to the Doctor. 
1119,BARNES: Is it speaking to you? What's it saying? 
1120,SPIDER: Send this fool away. 
1121,"LUPTON: Very well. Off you go, Barnes. "
1122,BARNES: What are we going to do? 
1123,"LUPTON: Later, man, later. "
1124,"BARNES: Oh, very well. "
1125,(Lupton leaves.) 
1126,SPIDER: We must prepare to meet this Doctor. 
1127,LUPTON: I see no necessity. 
1128,SPIDER: He could be dangerous. 
1129,LUPTON: So could I. So could I. 
1130,SPIDER: You will go to see him. 
1131,LUPTON: I shall not. 
1132,"SPIDER: You forget, Lupton. We are linked together now. I can twist"
1133,your mind as easily as a two leg boy twists another's arm. Like this! 
1134,(Lupton grabs his head in pain.) 
1135,"LUPTON: Oh, stop! "
1136,SPIDER: You won't need the spiders anymore. Isn't that what you said? 
1137,"LUPTON: Stop, I can't bear it! "
1138,SPIDER: Say please. 
1139,LUPTON: Please! Please! (The Spider releases him.) 
1140,LUPTON: Oh. 
1141,SPIDER: You will go to see the Doctor and lull his suspicions. In
1142,future you will do as I wish. 
1143,LUPTON: What did you do to my mind? It felt like red-hot needles. Was
1144,"it, was it this that you did? Or no. No, was it this! "
1145,(Lupton glares at the Spider and it writhes on the floor.) 
1146,"SPIDER: Ah! No! No, stop. "
1147,LUPTON: Say please. 
1148,"SPIDER: Please, Lupton! Please! "
1149,(Lupton stops.) 
1150,SPIDER: You are cleverer than the two legs on Metebelis Three. 
1151,LUPTON: I'm cleverer than most of them on Earth. 
1152,"SPIDER: Very well, you need not see this man. Come, we must make ready."
1153,
1154,LUPTON: I'm not going to Metebelis Three just to become a slave to that
1155,Queen of yours. 
1156,SPIDER: I like her arrogance no more than you do. You seek power on
1157,Earth. I shall seize it on Metebelis. We can help each other. Turn
1158,around. 
1159,LUPTON: Very well. 
1160,(The Spider jumps onto his back and vanishes.) 
1161,"SPIDER : Now, the crystal. "
1162,(Lupton searches the deck.) 
1163,LUPTON: It's gone. The crystal has gone!
1164,
1165, [Sitting room]
1166,
1167," DOCTOR: Look, Venerable, may we see this man"
1168,Lupton now? I'm sorry to seem pushy but it is very important. 
1169,CHO-JE: It is good that we have come to the west. You whip your poor
1170,"horse too much. He gallops so that he is exhausted and yet, you know,"
1171,he never leaves his stable. 
1172,SARAH: Now what's that supposed to mean? 
1173,"MIKE: I think he's saying that, er, time is an illusion. "
1174,"DOCTOR: And it'll all be the same in a hundred years. Yes, where have I"
1175,heard that before? 
1176,(Tommy comes down the stairs to the doorway and whispers to Sarah.) 
1177,TOMMY: Hey. Hey. 
1178,CHO-JE: There is only the now. The here and the now. The present moment
1179,will have to

1181, (Sarah leaves the sitting room.) 
1182,"SARAH: Hello, Tommy. "
1183,"TOMMY: Hello, Sarah Jane Smith. Tommy like you. "
1184,"SARAH: Well, I like you too. "
1185,"TOMMY: You give Tommy nice presents, it's pretty. "
1186,"SARAH: Oh, I haven't got another one, I'm afraid. "
1187,"TOMMY: No, no. Tommy got nice present for Sarah Jane Smith. You come. "
1188,"SARAH: Oh, well, not just now, Tommy. "
1189,"TOMMY: You come, Sarah Jane Smith. "
1190,(Tommy takes hold of her hand.) 
1191,"SARAH: Okay, okay, but we'll have to be quick."
1192,
1193,[Sitting room]
1194,
1195, MIKE: Suppose it'll mean something to me in the
1196,end. 
1197,"CHO-JE: Ah, the meaning of meaning is the last barrier to"
1198,understanding. 
1199,"DOCTOR: Yes, er, Venerable, could we see Mister Lupton now please? "
1200,CHO-JE: But of course. Mister Moss? 
1201,(Moss enters.) 
1202,"CHO-JE: If you would both wait here, this gentleman will find Mister"
1203,Lupton for you. 
1204,MOSS: Of course. 
1205,(Moss leaves.) 
1206,"CHO-JE: Excuse me, Doctor. "
1207,(Cho-Je spins the prayer wheel as he enters the inner room.) 
1208, [Spiritual Retreat]
1209,
1210, BARNES: I didn't take it. I wouldn't know what to
1211,do with it if I had it. 
1212,LUPTON: But you saw it? 
1213,"BARNES: Well, of course I did. You put it on the table. "
1214,LUPTON: Could it have been sent to Metebelis Three? 
1215,"SPIDER : No, my sisters haven't the power, you remember. The"
1216,crystal must still be on Earth. 
1217,LUPTON: Then we must find it. 
1218,SPIDER : There is no time. The power is building fast. We must be
1219,ready! 
1220,LUPTON: We don't have to go. 
1221,"SPIDER : If the Queen finds out that we have lost the crystal,"
1222,she'll kill us both. 
1223,"LUPTON: Right, we'll bluff them. We'll pretend we've still got it. "
1224,SPIDER : But they'll never believe it. 
1225,"LUPTON: We have no choice. Now listen, Barnes. "
1226,"BARNES: Perhaps you've gone mad, hearing voices, talking to yourself. "
1227,"LUPTON: You saw the spider, didn't you? "
1228,BARNES: Perhaps I've gone mad too. 
1229,(Barnes and Lupton go into a room. Tommy brings Sarah to the stairs
1230,cupboard.) 
1231,TOMMY: You stay. Tommy get present. Secret. 
1232,(Tommy goes into his cupboard.) 
1233,BARNES : Shall I look for the others then? 
1234,"LUPTON : No, no, no. "
1235,(Sarah peers round the corner.) 
1236,LUPTON: I'll go through the ritual by myself. 
1237,BARNES: In the cellar? Now? 
1238,"LUPTON: Yes, yes. See if you can keep the others away for half an hour"
1239,"or so, will you? "
1240,"MOSS: Lupton, Cho-Je wants you to meet some fellow with Yates. "
1241,"LUPTON: Yes, I know, I know. Tell him, er, tell him you can't find me."
1242,I'll need the mandala. 
1243,(Lupton and Barnes go into a room. Moss leaves. Tommy comes out of his
1244,cupboard.) 
1245,TOMMY: Sarah Jane Smith. 
1246,"SARAH: Oh, not now, Tommy. "
1247,"TOMMY: No, I "
1248,"SARAH: No, not now. Tommy, you know Mike Yates, don't you? "
1249,TOMMY: Yates. He give Tommy present! 
1250,"SARAH: Yes, yes, listen, Tommy. Now listen carefully. I want you to go"
1251,and find Mike Yates and tell him that Lupton has gone down to the
1252,cellar. 
1253,TOMMY: Cellar. 
1254,SARAH: And that I'm going down there too. 
1255,TOMMY: You 
1256,SARAH: Okay? 
1257,TOMMY: Cellar you 
1258,"SARAH: I've got to go. I must get there first. Cellar, Tommy. "
1259,(Sarah leaves.) 
1260,"TOMMY: But Sarah Jane Smith, your present! "
1261,(Tommy holds out the crystal. Lupton comes out of the room with the
1262,mandala rolled up under his arm and goes the other way.) 
1263,TOMMY: Yates. 
1264, [Cellar]
1265,
1266, (Sarah has got there first and hides as Lupton
1267,"enters, puts down a cushion and the mandala, sits and begins the"
1268,chant.)

1270,
1271, [Sitting room]
1272,
1273, MIKE: This is ridiculous. Where's that fellow got
1274,to? 
1275,"(Tommy enters, without his box.) "
1276,TOMMY: Yates. Sarah. 
1277,MIKE: Not now Tommy. 
1278,"TOMMY: Sarah, cellar. "
1279,MIKE: Not now. 
1280,"TOMMY: I tell you, mister, the cellar. "
1281,"DOCTOR: I think he's trying to tell you something important, Mike. "
1282,MIKE: It always is. 
1283,(Moss enters.) 
1284,"MIKE: Ah, there you are. "
1285,MOSS: I'm sorry. I can't find Lupton anywhere. 
1286,TOMMY: Lupton! 
1287,"MOSS: He's not in his room, he's not meditating. He's probably gone for"
1288,a walk. 
1289,TOMMY: Lupton in the cellar! 
1290,MIKE: What? 
1291,TOMMY: Sarah Jane Smith in the cellar! 
1292,"DOCTOR: Where is this cellar, Mike? "
1293,MIKE: I'll show you. 
1294,"TOMMY: Hey, hey, mister! "
1295,(The Doctor and Mike leave.) 
1296,TOMMY: I tell him. Tommy did it. 
1297,MOSS: You certainly did.

1314,SARAH: (Shouts.) I can't! 
1315,"(The Doctor approaches her, then the cellar vanishes and Sarah finds"
1316,herself in a desert on an alien world. And so is Lupton. Sarah hides
1317,"behind a large rock, then someone puts their hand over her mouth!) "

1319,
1320, MIKE: Barnes? He's gone. 
1321,"DOCTOR: Well, never mind. I doubt if he could have told us very much"
1322,"anyway. Well, there's only one thing for me to do, Mike. I've got to"
1323,"get after her, to Metebelis Three. "
1324,MIKE: In the Tardis? 
1325,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. "
1326,MIKE: But how can you be sure you'll get there? 
1327,"DOCTOR: Well, the Tardis may be a little erratic, I'll admit. After"
1328,"all, she is getting on a bit. But Metebelis Three is the one planet I"
1329,"can be absolutely certain of reaching. You see, I wired the coordinates"
1330,into the programmer. 
1331,"MIKE: Yes, but, but Doctor, a planet's a big place. "
1332,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I always leave the actual landing to the Tardis"
1333,"herself. She's no fool, you know. "
1334,MIKE: You speak as if she were alive. 
1335,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I do, don't I? Bye, Mike."

1340,style village.) 
1341,"TUAR: Hey, I found a spy! "
1342,"SABOR: (an old man) Tuar, you're a fool. If she's a spy, you've"
1343,condemned us all. We're as good as dead. 
1344,"TUAR: Look, I'm tired of waiting. The eight legs'll kill us all anyway."
1345,It's time we fought back. 
1346,SABOR: It will do us no good speaking treason. Release her. Release
1347,"her, I say! "
1348,REGA: (young girl) Who are you? How did you come here? 
1349,SARAH: Er 
1350,"TUAR: Oh, don't waste time, Rega. She's a spy. We must kill her. "
1351,SARAH: Eh? 
1352,SABOR: Already we're in danger. Do you want the whole village wiped
1353,out? Remember Skorda. 
1354,SARAH: But I'm not a spy. I don't know who you are or anything. 
1355,TUAR: You're lying. 
1356,"SARAH: Well anyway, who am I supposed to be spying for? The spiders? "
1357,TUAR: You see? Who but a spy would dare use a forbidden word? We must
1358,kill her before she can betray us. 
1359,"SARAH: No, no! "
1360,"SABOR: Tuar, No! "
1361,"(Tuar pushes Sarah up some steps and leans her backwards over the edge,"
1362,which is on top of a steep cliff.)

1804,"DOCTOR: Oh, Sarah'll be all right for the moment. "
1805,"TUAR: Well, how can you tell that? "
1806,DOCTOR: Because the spiders'll be watching her. They'll want to know
1807,how she got here and why. 
1808,"TUAR: And meanwhile my father could be killed! We must attack, attack"
1809,now! 
1810,"ARAK: The girl said you could help us, Doctor. "
1811,"DOCTOR: Mmm. Yes, I think I can. But first of all I must know what"
1812,we're up against. How did the spiders get here?

1815,
1816, SABOR: The eight legs? Why they came from Earth
1817,too. 
1818,SARAH: But there aren't any spiders as big as these on Earth. 
1819,"SABOR: Keep your voice down, my child. That word's forbidden here. But"
1820,"you're quite right. An ordinary eight legs, he must have been blown by"
1821,the wind out of that crashed ship up in the mountains. There are blue
1822,crystals there. They have strange powers. 
1823,"SARAH: Oh, you don't have to tell me that. "
1824,"SABOR: Ah, then you must know that these crystals can enlarge the mind."
1825,"Over the years, these spiders became cleverer and cleverer and larger"
1826,"and larger. By the time man found out, it were too late."

1830, ARAK: And they've ruled us ever since. A few they
1831,take and twist their minds until they become their slaves. The rest of
1832,us they rule by fear. 
1833,DOCTOR: I see. 
1834,ARAK: They grew angry with the people of Skorda. They kept too much
1835,"food for themselves, so the eight legs wiped them out. Two hundred and"
1836,"sixty-nine of them, even the children. "
1837,TUAR: They're quite ruthless. We must attack them now. 
1838,"DOCTOR: Hmm. Go out and get me some stones, will you? "
1839,TUAR: Stones? 
1840,"DOCTOR: Yes, pebbles. You know, about that big. Little pieces of rock."
1841,As many different kinds as you can. 
1842,ARAK: But how can pebbles help? 
1843,"DOCTOR: Let's just saying I'm playing a hunch, hmm? "

1853,Three with an unusual structure? Now I'm looking for a stone that will
1854,"absorb the energy of the spider's attacks. Oh, I do beg your pardon."

1879,SABOR: One is only frightened when there's hope of rescue. We have no

1911,"LUPTON: No, there must be some mistake. "
1912,"DOCTOR: Ah, poor fellow. I hope they won't be too hard on him. He fell"

1936,will die. 
1937,LUPTON: I don't understand. 
1938,SPIDER: They know that we did not bring the crystal to Metebelis. I'm
1939,"sorry, Lupton. "
1940,LUPTON: But how did you find out? 
1941,QUEEN: In the same way that we first traced it. By its vibrations
1942,through space and time. The crystal is still on Earth. Do not attempt
1943,to deny it. 
1944,LUPTON: Why should I deny it? I know where the crystal is hidden. I
1945,"told you, but I didn't say it was hidden on Metebelis. The situation is"
1946,"unchanged. If you wish to invade Earth, you need my help. "
1947,"QUEEN: Be careful, two leg. You may go too far. "
1948,"SPIDER: But it's true. Once more, O Queen, your arrogance has"
1949,endangered the master plan of the Great One. 
1950,SPIDERS: All praise to the Great One! 
1951,SPIDER: It is not the first mistake the Queen has made. 
1952,QUEEN: Mistake? 
1953,SPIDER 2: Maybe the most noble Queen is growing old? 
1954,SPIDER 3: I think the time has come for a coronation. 
1955,"QUEEN: Wait! Wait, my sisters, do not be so hasty. I merely wanted to"
1956,be sure. 
1957,SPIDER: Then what of the attack on Earth? 
1958,QUEEN: I shall visit the cave of the crystal and ask the approval of

1969,SARAH: Ha ha. Great. 
1970,"DOCTOR: Judging by the habits of our captor's Earth cousins, I would"
1971,say we're probably in the larder. 
1972,SARAH: Right first time. 
1973,DOCTOR: I think they'll find I'm rather a tough old bird. 
1974,"SARAH: An old boiler, in fact. "
1975,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, make a good item on the next agenda of the spider"
1976,council meeting. Whether to stew a Time Lord or roast him in a slow
1977,oven. 
1978,SARAH: That'll give them something to chew over. 
1979,"DOCTOR: Yes, something they can really get their teeth into, what? "
1980,"SARAH: Hey, Doctor, you know, I'm still not clear what's going on. I"
1981,"mean, if the spiders wanted that crystal so badly, well, why didn't"
1982,they just take it before you did? 
1983,DOCTOR: They didn't arrive until much later. We're in the future
1984,"remember, Sarah. "
1985,"SARAH: Oh, of course. Huh. "
1986,"DOCTOR: Now listen to me, both of you, listen. Arak is trying to get"
1987,together some of the men from the other villages. They're going to try
1988,a rescue.

2037,do requires the utmost concentration. 
2038,SABOR: What are you trying to do?

2063,SARAH: The Great One? 
2064,QUEEN: Never mind. I lied to the council but I had to lie. I desire
2065,only peace with you and all two legs.

2240,LUPTON: Wait. Where is this contact? 
2241,SPIDER: The place you opened. 
2242,"LUPTON: The monastery? Then the group must be operating, but be"
2243,careful. They might be hostile now. 
2244,SPIDER 2: Then the approach must be secret.

2259,all about it. 
2260,CHO-JE: I'm glad you did. Dear me. These foolish fellows. 
2261,TOMMY: But don't you think we should tell K'Anpo? 
2262,"CHO-JE: Indeed we should tell the Abbot, when we know what to tell him."

2267,will go down to the cellar and see what these naughty chaps are about.
2268,Now off you go now. 
2269,"TOMMY: Yes, Cho-Je. Cho-Je? "
2270,CHO-JE: Yes? 
2271,TOMMY: You don't seem very surprised to find me changed. 
2272,"CHO-JE: When everything is new, can anything be a surprise? "
2273,TOMMY: I see. 
2274,CHO-JE: Hurry now.

2278,runs down the stairs.) 
2279,CHO-JE: You must stop! 
2280,(They fall silent.) 
2281,CHO-JE: You are the most misguided of men. Did I not warn you? Did I
2282,not tell you of the risks you ran? 
2283,(A spider dangles from a thread in front of Cho-Je and zaps him.) 
2284,MIKE: No!

2325,"NESKA: Stay, girl. Tell us. What has been happening? "
2326,"SARAH: Oh, don't worry, Neska. Sabor is safe. Arak and Tuar are"

2345,"BARNES: No. An unfortunate oversight, Doctor. It won't occur again. "

2347,Doctor uses a stone to absorb the other ones.)

2358,TOMMY: What happened to the others? 
2359,"DOCTOR: Oh, they've been taken over. "
2360,SARAH: By the spiders? 
2361,DOCTOR: Yes.

2385,K'ANPO: It is kind of you to come and visit an old man. 
2386,DOCTOR: (Tibetan.) 
2387,K'ANPO: You speak Tibetan? 
2388,"DOCTOR: A little, sir, yes. "
2389,SARAH: What did you just say? 
2390,DOCTOR: I apologised to the Rinpoche for not bringing him a cotton
2391,scarf. 
2392,K'ANPO: You friend knows not only our language but also our customs.
2393,The ceremonial gift merely symbolises friendship. We have no need for
2394,"symbols, you and I. "
2395,TOMMY: I think I'd better keep a watch outside. If the others get out
2396,of the cellar 
2397,"K'ANPO: As yet they haven't managed it. They may soon, though. Thank"
2398,"you, Tommy. "
2399,(Tommy leaves.) 
2400,K'ANPO: Pray be seated. 
2401,(The Doctor sits on a stool at the Abbot's feet. Sarah is further
2402,away.) 
2403,"K'ANPO: Now, Doctor. You have a story to tell me. "
2404,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I have a strange feeling that you already know most"
2405,"of it. You see, I found a crystal. A blue crystal. "
2406,K'ANPO: Found? 
2407,"DOCTOR: Well, perhaps stole might be a better word. Forgive me. Have we"
2408,met before? 
2409,K'ANPO: The recognition of friends is not always easy. Tell me about
2410,this crystal you stole. 
2411,"DOCTOR: Well it didn't occur to me that I had stolen it, at the time."
2412,You see

2441,"MOSS: No, no, I don't want anything more to do with it. I'm going. "
2442,(But the spider on his back has other ideas. He stiffens in pain.) 
2443,MOSS' SPIDER : You will stay. You will do as I wish. You will obey
2444,me. 
2445,"MOSS: Yes, yes, anything. Stop it. Stop it! "
2446,KEAVER: What are we supposed to do? 
2447,LAND: I can see. I can see a blue crystal. 
2448,"LAND'S SPIDER : Yes, we must find the crystal at any cost."
2449,Concentrate. All concentrate. 
2450,KEAVER: I can see it too. 
2451,"MOSS: It, it's that way. "
2452,"MOSS' SPIDER : Yes! Yes, we can feel the vibrations. It is near. "
2453,BARNES: Come on then!
2454,
2455, [K'Anpo's room]
2456,
2457," DOCTOR: So you see, the crystal was even more"
2458,important than I thought. They want it very badly. 
2459,K'ANPO: Then perhaps they should have it. 
2460,"DOCTOR: No, sir, never. Once they get a hold of that crystal, nothing"
2461,can stop them taking over the Earth. 
2462,SARAH: Or even the universe itself. 
2463,DOCTOR: Or even the universe itself. I wish I knew where that crystal
2464,was at this moment. 
2465,(K'Anpo takes it from his robe.) 
2466,K'ANPO: Tommy brought it to me. It was the crystal which cured him. 
2467,DOCTOR: Thank heavens it's safe. 
2468,SARAH: Give it to me. 
2469,"DOCTOR: Sarah, what's the matter with you? "
2470,SARAH: Give 
2471,QUEEN : Me the crystal. I must have it. I must! Give it to me! 
2472,"DOCTOR: Sarah, what's come over you? (Sarah zaps the Doctor with energy"
2473,and he clutches his chest.) 
2474,K'ANPO: Stay! 
2475,(Sarah stands still.) 
2476,"DOCTOR: Sarah, what has the Queen Spider done to you? What has she"
2477,done? 
2478,K'ANPO: It's no use. See through my eyes. Look. 
2479,"(K'Anpo puts his hand on the Doctor's, and the Queen Spider becomes"

2490,MOSS: What are we going to do? 
2491,"BARNES: Be quiet. Stand back, you. "
2492,"(Tommy stands firm, so Barnes zaps him. Tommy staggers but stays"
2493,upright.)

2495,"LAND: Come on now, Tommy. "
2496,KEAVER: Now! 
2497,"(Keaver and Land grab Tommy's arms, but he throws them off. Barnes"

2511,"SARAH: I, I "
2512,K'ANPO: You are free. You don't have to be dominated. Look into your
2513,mind and see that you are free. 
2514,"DOCTOR: Sarah, look at the crystal. Look at it! Look deep into its blue"

2541," SARAH: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Doctor. "
2542,DOCTOR: What have you got to be sorry about? You did very well. You
2543,should be proud of yourself. 
2544,"SARAH: To let that creature take me over like that. I mean, I actually"
2545,volunteered. 
2546,K'ANPO: We are all apt to surrender ourselves to domination. Even the
2547,strongest of us. 
2548,DOCTOR: Do you mean me? 
2549,K'ANPO: Not all spiders sit on the back. 
2550,"SARAH: Oh, I don't understand. You're not saying they've taken over the"
2551,"Doctor, are you? "
2552,"DOCTOR: Oh no, Sarah, no. No, he's talking about my greed. "
2553,SARAH: Greed? You? 
2554,"DOCTOR: Yes, my greed for knowledge, for information. He's saying that"
2555,all this is basically my fault. If I hadn't taken the crystal in the
2556,first place. I know who you are now. 
2557,"K'ANPO: You were always a little slow on the uptake, my boy. "
2558,"DOCTOR: It's been a long, long time. "
2559,SARAH: You know each other? 
2560,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Yes, he was my teacher. My, my guru, if you like. In"
2561,"another time, another place. "
2562,K'ANPO: Another life. 
2563,"SARAH: Oh, no. Don't tell me you're a Time Lord too? "
2564,K'ANPO: I am. But the discipline they serve was not for me. 
2565,DOCTOR: No. Nor for me. 
2566,K'ANPO: I wouldn't have chosen your alternative. To borrow a Tardis was
2567,"a little naughty, to say the least. "
2568,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I had to get away. I hadn't your power. "
2569,"K'ANPO: Indeed. I regenerated and came to Earth, to Tibet. "
2570,SARAH: Regenerated? 
2571,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, when a Time Lord's body wears out, he regenerates,"
2572,becomes new. 
2573,K'ANPO: That is why we can live such a long time. 
2574,"SARAH: I see. Well, what about Cho-Je? Is he a Time Lord, too? "
2575,"K'ANPO: In a sense. In another sense, he doesn't exist. "
2576,SARAH: You've lost me. 
2577,"DOCTOR: Me too, I'm afraid. "
2578,K'ANPO: Cho-Je is a projection of my own self.

2602,SARAH: What moment? 
2603,"K'ANPO: The moment I have been waiting for. The moment of truth, if"
2604,you'll forgive a cliché. The moment of truth for us both. You know what

2694,dreamed of is there in the palm of his hand. 
2695,QUEEN: We dare not take the crystal. The Great One is all seeing. 
2696,COUNCIL: All praise to the Great One! 
2697,QUEEN: The Great One is all knowing. 
2698,COUNCIL: All praise to the Great One! 
2699,QUEEN: The Great One is all powerful! 
2700,COUNCIL: All praise to the Great One! 
2701,"QUEEN: You have beaten us, Doctor. It is good that you will die. "
2702,(Arak and Tuar reluctantly let the Doctor leave.) 
2703,LUPTON: You superstitious fools. 
2704,"QUEEN: Be silent, Lupton! "
2705,LUPTON: I will not be silent. I've listened to you for too long. To
2706,think that I've lost my chance of power through a spider! A spider that
2707,"I could crush underfoot, without a second thought. A spider! "
2708,"(Lupton raises his fist to hit the Queen, so she zaps him.)"

2710, [K'Anpo's room]
2711,
2712," K'ANPO: His compassion protected him, just as"
2713,Tommy's innocence was his shield. 
2714,"MIKE: Hello, Sarah Jane. "
2715,"SARAH: Hi. Hey, we thought you'd had it. "
2716,"MIKE: Well, not this time. Oh, I feel fine. "
2717,SARAH: Yeah? 
2718,TOMMY: K'Anpo. 
2719,(K'Anpo looks very tired.) 
2720,"K'ANPO: I'm afraid this old body has had it, Miss Smith. "
2721,(K'Anpo's head falls back.) 
2722,SARAH: No! 
2723,"CHO-JE: Dear friends, please don't. Please don't "
2724,(Cho-Je vanishes.) 
2725,SARAH: What's happening? 
2726,(K'Anpo becomes Cho-Je.) 
2727,"CHO-JE: Please don't. Please don't concern yourselves. I am not dying,"
2728,merely regenerating. 
2729,TOMMY: Cho-Je. 
2730,"CHO-JE: No, Tommy. I am K'Anpo. Will you put this in your magazine,"
2731,Sarah Jane Smith?
2732,
2733, [Crystal cave]
2734,
2735, GREAT ONE : Stop! Have you brought the crystal
2736,to me? 
2737,"DOCTOR: Well if I had not, why should I have returned? "
2738,"GREAT ONE : Very well. Very well, advance. "
2739,(The Doctor walks around a corner and sees the universes biggest
2740,spider.) 
2741,DOCTOR: I've brought you the crystal. Now why don't you just take it
2742,"and leave the humans in peace, both here and on Earth? "
2743,GREAT ONE: You think I care for the puny plans of my subjects? Earth?
2744,One paltry planet among millions? Give me the crystal. I thirst for it!
2745,I ache for it! 
2746,"DOCTOR: Well, why is it so important to you? "
2747,GREAT ONE: You see this web of crystal above my head? It reproduces the
2748,pattern of my brain. One perfect crystal and it will be complete. That
2749,is the perfect crystal I need. 
2750,DOCTOR: And then? 
2751,"GREAT ONE: My every thought will resonate within the web, and grow in"
2752,"power until, until, until "
2753,DOCTOR: But you've built a positive feedback circuit. You're trying to
2754,increase your mental powers to infinity. 
2755,GREAT ONE: Exactly! I shall be the ruler of the entire universe! 
2756,DOCTOR: Now listen to me. Listen. I haven't got much time left. What
2757,"you're trying to do is impossible. If you complete that circuit, the"
2758,energy will build up and up until it cannot be contained. You will
2759,destroy yourself. 
2760,GREAT ONE: You waste the little time remaining to you. Even now the
2761,cave of crystal is destroying the cells of your body. I will grant you
2762,one last favour. You may watch the completion of my triumph before you
2763,die! 
2764,(The crystal flies out of the Doctor's hand and becomes the keystone of
2765,the web lattice.) 
2766,GREAT ONE: I am complete! Now I am total power! All praise to the Great
2767,One! 
2768,DOCTOR: Stop. Stop! Don't you see what's happened to you? 
2769,GREAT ONE: All praise to the Great One! All praise to me! Bow down
2770,"before me, planets! Bow down, stars! Bow down, all galaxies and worship"
2771,"the Great One! The me! The Great, all-powerful me! Argh! "
2772,(The giant spider starts to glow red.) 
2773,GREAT ONE: I hurt! Help me! I am burning! My brain is on fire! 
2774,(The Doctor runs out of the cave.) 
2775,GREAT ONE: Help me!

2777, [Spider's Council Chamber]
2778,
2779, (The spiders are dying here too.) 
2780,ARAK: The influence is going. 
2781,TUAR: We're free! 
2782,"ARAK: Come, my brother. "
2783, [Cellar]
2784,
2785, ALL: Om. Om. Om. 
2786,(The spiders die and fall of the men's backs. The Doctor staggers back
2787,to the Tardis and goes inside before the crystal mountain explodes.)

2789, [UNIT Laboratory]
2790,
2791," BRIGADIER: Hello, Miss Smith. "
2792,"SARAH: Oh, hello, Brigadier. I just thought I'd pop in and. Well, to"
2793,"tell you the truth, I don't quite know why I did pop in, actually. "
2794,"BRIGADIER: To see if there was any sign of the old fellow, eh? "
2795,"SARAH: Yes. But there can't be, can there? I mean, he's been gone over"
2796,three weeks now. 
2797,"BRIGADIER: Oh, that's nothing. One time I didn't see him for months."
2798,"And what's more, when he did turn up, he had a new face. Could have"
2799,been a completely different man. 
2800,SARAH: No. he knew if he went back there he would destroy himself.
2801,We'll never see him again. 
2802,(The Tardis materialises and the Doctor almost falls out of the
2803,doorway.) 
2804,SARAH: Doctor! 
2805,"DOCTOR: Hello, Sarah. I got lost in the time vortex. The Tardis brought"
2806,me home. 
2807,(The Doctor steps out of the Tardis and falls onto the floor. The
2808,Brigadier puts a cushion under his head.) 
2809,"SARAH: Oh! Oh, Doctor, why did you have to go back? "
2810,"DOCTOR: I had to face my fear, Sarah. I had to face my fear. That was"
2811,more important than just going on living. 
2812,"SARAH: Please, don't die. "
2813,"DOCTOR: A tear, Sarah Jane? No, don't cry. While there's life there's "
2814,SARAH: No. 
2815,"(She closes the Doctor's eyes. There is a faint buzzing sound, then"
2816,"K'Anpo-Cho-Je appears, sitting cross-legged in midair.) "
2817,CHO-JE: It's all right. He is not dead. 
2818,SARAH: Oh no. I don't think I can take much more. 
2819,"CHO-JE: I am sorry to have startled you, my dear. "
2820,"BRIGADIER: Won't you introduce me to your friend, Miss Smith? "
2821,"SARAH: Oh, er, yes. This is the Abbot of. No, it's Cho-Je. I mean, it"
2822,looks like Cho-Je but it is really K'Anpo Rinpoche. I think. 
2823,BRIGADIER: Thank you. That makes everything quite clear. 
2824,CHO-JE: The Doctor is alive. 
2825,"SARAH: No, you're wrong. He's dead. "
2826,CHO-JE: All the cells of his body have been devastated by the Metebelis
2827,"crystals, but you forget, he is a Time Lord. I will give the process a"
2828,little push and the cells will regenerate. He will become a new man. 
2829,BRIGADIER: Literally? 
2830,"CHO-JE: Of course, he will look quite different. "
2831,BRIGADIER: Not again. 
2832,CHO-JE: And it will shake up the brain cells a little. You may find his
2833,behaviour somewhat erratic. 
2834,SARAH: When will all this happen? 
2835,"CHO-JE: Well there's no time like the present, is there. "
2836,"(Cho-Je aims his fingers at the Doctor, then fades away.) "
2837,CHO-JE: Goodbye. Look after him. 
2838,BRIGADIER: Now wait a moment. 
2839,"SARAH: Look, Brigadier. Look. I think it's starting. "
2840,"BRIGADIER: Well, here we go again. "

2842,younger. Number Four Doctor has arrived.)
