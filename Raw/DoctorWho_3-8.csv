21,[Tardis] 
22," (The time machine has landed once more, and the"
23,scanner shows the image of a rocky ravine.) 
24,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think I can say that I know just exactly where we are. "
25,"DODO: Past, present or future? "
26,DOCTOR: In the future. Very much in the future. We've now reached the
27,"distant horizon of an age, an age of peace and prosperity. Now, I'm"
28,going to be off. 
29,(They all move away from the scanner just as a primitive looking figure
30,wearing animal skins and carrying a club comes into view.)

32,[outside the Tardis]
33,
34,"(Leaving Steven and Dodo to wait by the Tardis, the"
35,Doctor sets off along a narrow path through the scrub. He stops
36,"occasionally to take readings, using a hand-held device that looks like"
37,an old-fashioned ship's compass. He chuckles to himself.) 
38,STEVEN: He said five minutes. 
39,DODO: The Doctor has no idea of time. For someone who's travelled about
40,"in time as much as he has, that's rather funny. "
41,"STEVEN: This is nothing to laugh at, Dodo."
42,"DODO: Oh, don't take it so seriously. If you're so worried about him,"
43,you shouldn't have let him go.
44,STEVEN: All right. You try telling the Doctor what to do. 
45,DODO: Then you should have gone with him. 
46,STEVEN: You heard what he said. 
47,DODO: You don't have to do everything he tells you. You're a grown man.
48,Or are you?

51,
52,"(Along the ravine, the Doctor is absorbed in his"
53,"studies, unaware that he's being watched from the nearby bushes. To his"
54,"delight, the readings appear to confirm his initial conclusions.) "
55,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's just as I thought. Yes. Yes, well I think my young"
56,friends are in for quite a surprise. 
57,"(The Doctor moves on. Concealed in the bushes, two men dressed in"
58,"animal skins watch him leave, then move to follow. Steven has left the"
59,Tardis landing site.) 
60,STEVEN : Doctor! Doctor? 
61,"DOCTOR: Oh, dear me, what was that now? Well, I shan't be long anyway. "
62,"(Annoyed at the disturbance, the Doctor continues with his scans,"
63,oblivious to the potential threat of the watching men. 
64,STEVEN : Doctor? 
65,"(Sensing movement, the Doctor turns and peers into the bushes.) "
66,STEVEN : Doctor? Doctor!
67,
68,[Outside the Tardis]
69,
70,(Dodo stands on a boulder and looks anxiously after
71,Steven. She's unable to see him over the bushes but hears his voice
72,clearly as he calls back to her.) 
73,"STEVEN : He doesn't answer yet, Dodo. I think I'd better go and"
74,look for him. 
75,DODO: All right. 
76,STEVEN : I won't go far. 
77,(Dodo sits down on the boulder to wait. From somewhere above her comes
78,"the sound of pebbles trickling down into the ravine. Alarmed, she turns"
79,"and peers around nervously, hoping that her imagination is playing"
80,"tricks on her. After a moment, a primitive looking man appears on the"
81,"ridge above, crouched and apparently ready to attack. Dodo screams."
82,Steven comes running.) 
83,STEVEN: Dodo! What's happened? 
84,DODO: Up there. 
85,STEVEN: There's nothing there. 
86,DODO: I saw a man in animal skins and with an axe. 
87,"STEVEN: You sure? Well, the Doctor said "
88,DODO: I don't care what he said. I saw him. He was like a savage from
89,the Stone Age. 
90,STEVEN: Then the Doctor was wrong. We're not in the future at all. We
91,must be back at the beginning of man. 
92,[Scrubland]
93,
94,"(Having collected enough data, the Doctor starts"
95,back towards the Tardis.) 
96,DOCTOR: That ridiculous young man. He thought I'd made a mistake. 
97,"(Behind the screen of bushes, the two primitives are fearful as the"
98,Doctor approaches their hiding place.) 
99,TOR: He is coming. What's he carrying? 
100,CHAL: It is not a light gun. 
101,TOR: He is one of the leaders? 
102,CHAL: He is not one of our people. 
103,TOR: He is coming near. We must run. 
104,CHAL: Stay. We kill this man. 
105,"DOCTOR: Hello, there. I say, come out from underneath there. Now don't"
106,be alarmed. Come along now. 
107,TOR: Look. 
108,"(Behind the Doctor, the savages can see two soldiers approaching along"
109,the path. 
110,"DOCTOR: Can you hear me? Oh, I say, do come out from underneath there,"
111,will you? 
112,(The Doctor spins round.) 
113,"DOCTOR: Oh, good gracious me. You know, I thought for one moment you"
114,were hiding behind those bushes. 
115,EDAL: We have come to welcome you. 
116,EXORSE: It is a great honour to have you visit our planet. 
117,(Captain Edal and his young companion are clad in synthetic military
118,uniforms and elaborate helmets. Each carries an energy weapon with a
119,"wide, flared muzzle.) "
120,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, I see. Well, I am expected. Do you know who I am? "
121,"EDAL: Not your name, of course, but our space observers have their own"
122,name for you. 
123,"DOCTOR: Oh, and what might that be? "
124,EXORSE: You are known to us as the Traveller from Beyond Time. 
125,DOCTOR: I see. And how would you expect me here and now? 
126,EXORSE: The Elders of our city have been plotting the course of your
127,space-time ship for many light years. They estimated your arrival some
128,time ago. 
129,"DOCTOR: I see. Yes, well, that's very clever of them. "
130,EDAL: What is this? We understood from our Elders that you did not
131,carry weapons. 
132,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, they're quite right, yes, I never do. No, this is my"
133,"RV, you see. This is my Reacting Vibrator. I'm able to do my"
134,calculations from this. As I told my young friends 
135,EDAL: You are not alone? 
136,"DOCTOR: Good gracious, no. Did you expect me to be? "
137,EDAL: We have no information about your companions. 
138,"DOCTOR: Oh, they're very pleasant. Yes, they're both very pleasant"
139,apart from their juvenile exuberances. I'm sure you'll like them. They
140,must be at the back here somewhere. I think they're rather worried
141,because I'm a bit late joining them. 
142,EDAL: We had no instructions about them. The Elders must be informed.
143,You must come with us. 
144,DOCTOR: Must? 
145,EXORSE: Captain Edal wishes to take you to the Elders of our City. They
146,are waiting to welcome you. 
147,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, of course, yes, yes, yes, I shall come with you. In the"
148,"meantime, young man, I wonder if you'd mind trying to find my young"
149,people for me. Steven and Dodo. Tell them the Doctor sent you. 
150,"EDAL: Go for them, Exorse. Bring them to the city. This way."
151,
152,[Outside the Tardis]
153,
154,"STEVEN: I'll have to go and look for him, Dodo."
155,Something must have happened to him. 
156,DODO: I'll come with you. 
157,(Dodo looks up once more.) 
158,DODO: Steven! 
159,STEVEN: What is it? 
160,DODO: There is something up there. 
161,"STEVEN: Look, you're imagining things. Come on. "
162,(Dodo screams as something falls heavily to the ground at their feet.) 
163,DODO: Told you. 
164,(Steven pulls the object from the soil.) 
165,"STEVEN: A spear. It's sharp as a knife. You were right, Dodo. There is"
166,someone up there. 
167,DODO: What are we do now? 
168,"STEVEN: Back to the Tardis, quick. "
169,(Steven and Dodo turn and run back up the path. On the ridge above
170,"them, several primitives emerge from hiding, chasing them along the"
171,ravine throwing crude spears.) 
172,DODO: They're getting nearer! 
173,(Suddenly one of the savages is hit. Steven and Dodo take cover behind
174,the Tardis as an unexpected silence falls. Dodo peers round the Tardis
175,and screams.) 
176,EXORSE: Welcome to the Traveller's companions. You are Dodo and Steven?
177,
178,STEVEN: How do you know? Who are you? 
179,EXORSE: The Traveller told me I would find you here. 
180,STEVEN: The Traveller? You mean the Doctor? Is he all right? 
181,EXORSE: Perfectly. He has gone to meet the Elders of our City. 
182,DODO: But the savages? 
183,EXORSE: I think you will find that some of us are fairly civilised. 
184,DODO: Then this isn't the Iron Age? 
185,EXORSE: By no means. 
186,STEVEN: The Doctor was right. 
187,"EXORSE: Please, come with me to the City. Our Elders wait to honour"
188,your Doctor. They will be very happy also to welcome his friends. 
189,[Council Chamber]
190,
191,(The Doctor is escorted to a vast walled city with
192,sweeping arches and elegant columns constructed of pale stone. A place
193,of light and learning bearing all the hallmarks of a highly advanced
194,society. An elegant bearded man greets the Doctor with a warm smile.) 
195,"JANO: You are welcome, welcome indeed. Though we know you only as a"
196,"record in our charts of space and time, yet you seem to us like an old"
197,friend. 
198,"DOCTOR: Well, that's very kind of you to make me feel so welcome. "
199,JANO: We are honoured by your visit. The whole city looks upon you with
200,"admiration. Let me introduce myself. I am Jano, leader of the council"
201,of Elders. These are my councillors. We have all known about you for a
202,"long time. Look, we have charted your voyages from galaxy to galaxy and"
203,"from age to age, but we never thought that we would meet you face to"
204,"face. This is a great moment in our history. To mark our admiration, we"
205,would be pleased if you would accept the office of one of our high
206,Elders. 
207,"DOCTOR: Well, my dear sir, that's very good of you. Yes, yes, very good"
208,"of you indeed. Yes, I don't remember being so highly honoured before"
209,like this anywhere I've been. 
210,(Two female attendants step forward to dress the Doctor in the
211,elaborate robes of a High Elder.) 
212,JANO: We recognise in you the greatest specialist in time-space
213,exploration. You have taken this branch of learning far beyond our
214,elementary calculations. 
215,"DOCTOR: Oh, come, come, my dear sir. I know that you've been very"
216,"responsible for vast scientific research. And at the same time, I"
217,always knew a race existed of great intelligence in this segment of the
218,universe. 
219,"JANO: Thank you, Doctor. We like to think that we have created here"
220,something of lasting value. 
221,"DOCTOR: You have, you have. Indeed, you have. And if I may so say,"
222,thank you dear ladies for making me appear so grand. 
223,(The Doctor is admiring his new clothes as Exorse arrives.) 
224,"EXORSE: The Doctor's two friends, sir. Steven and Dodo. "
225,JANO: You are very welcome. 
226,"DOCTOR: Ah, there you are, both of you. Well, I don't think I was so"
227,"far wrong, my boy. What do I look like, my dear? "
228,"DODO: You're really with it now, Doctor. "
229,"DOCTOR: Yes. With what, my dear? "
230,STEVEN: What is this place? 
231,JANO: Did the Doctor not tell you? 
232,DODO: Not exactly. 
233,STEVEN: He said it was an age of peace and prosperity. 
234,"DOCTOR: Yes, and I was right. They are very highly developed civilised"
235,minds. 
236,JANO: But our calculations were incomplete. We did not realise that the
237,"Doctor would have anyone with him. Nevertheless, although our honours"
238,"are for him, our gifts are for you. "
239,(Steven is presented with an ornate dagger and Dodo is given mirror
240,inlaid with precious gemstones. ) 
241,"DODO: Oh, thank you. It's beautiful. "
242,"STEVEN: Look at that, Doctor. "
243,"DODO: Steven, these are real diamonds. "
244,JANO: Perhaps Steven and Dodo would like to make themselves at home. 
245,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, thank you. "
246,JANO: Our young people will show them round. 
247,"DOCTOR: An excellent idea, sir. Well, my boy, now perhaps you'll"
248,believe me next time I tell you I know precisely where I am. 
249,(Steven and Dodo are lead away as the Doctor turns back to Jano.) 
250,"JANO: Now, Doctor, we have many questions to ask you. "
251,[Outside the City]
252,
253,"EDAL: We're only the city guard, of course. They"
254,"don't ask our opinion, do they? "
255,"EXORSE: What's the matter, Captain? "
256,EDAL: I don't trust them. I never did trust strangers. Why should we
257,treat this old Doctor as one of ourselves? 
258,EXORSE: The Elders think highly of him. 
259,"EDAL: The Elders. All right, we've wasted enough time this morning. Get"
260,back on patrol. Take the Crater section. 
261,"(Edal and Exorse split up. At a distance the savages, now accompanied"
262,"by a girl, watch them go.) "
263,CHAL: They have begun hunting. 
264,TOR: We must warn our people. 
265,"CHAL: Nanina, go back to the caves. Tell the families to hide. "
266,"NANINA: But what of you, Chal? "
267,"CHAL: We will be safe, we will warn the others. Nanina, take care in"
268,the craters. 
269,"(Nanina slips away. Out in the craters, Exorse is quartering the ground"
270,"in a standard search pattern. He's poised and alert, with his gun"
271,"raised, one finger curled in readiness on the trigger.)"
272,
273, [City Avenue]
274,
275,"(Steven and Dodo are being guided by a young man,"
276,"Avon, (no, not Paul Darrow) and a girl called Flower.) "
277,FLOWER: We have built into the city a life-giving sun of our own. Isn't
278,"that right, Avon? "
279,AVON: It is man's intellect which decides the heat and cold in our
280,city. 
281,"FLOWER: Yes. After all, the Elders do know what's best for us, although"
282,it would be rather nice to know what real things are like sometimes. 
283,AVON: Real what? 
284,"FLOWER: You know. Real wind, real rain, real sunshine. "
285,AVON: Don't be ridiculous. They have given us all this. 
286,DODO: It's beautiful. 
287,AVON: Our artists have every opportunity to develop their talents.
288,"Here, everyone has a chance to do what is best for him to do. "
289,STEVEN: It's certainly a wonderful job. But how have you managed it?
290,What's the secret? 
291,FLOWER: Secret? What makes you think we have a secret? 
292,STEVEN: Other civilisations have failed to make this advance. 
293,"FLOWER: Well, that doesn't mean "
294,"AVON: Be quiet, Flower. Our scientists have made one simple discovery,"
295,"and due to this they have found the way to give us all greater energy,"
296,greater intellect and greater talents. 
297,STEVEN: One simple discovery? 
298,DODO: What was it? 
299,AVON: This is something best discussed by the Elders and your Doctor.
300,
301,[Council Chamber]
302,
303,"DOCTOR: Well, gentlemen, I can't just sit here in"
304,"all these grand clothes without asking a few questions. After all,"
305,there's my reputation to think about. 
306,"JANO: What do you mean, Doctor? "
307,"DOCTOR: Well, if I accept your gifts, I must endorse your life. But I"
308,can't do that without knowing something about you. 
309,JANO: But surely you know a great deal about us. 
310,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know very well that you are far advanced than most"
311,"planets. But how you achieve this, I know not. And let's face it"
312,"gentlemen, you are much advanced. Now, I would like to know how."
313,
314,[Outside The City]
315,
316,(Nanina is used to hiding from the guards with
317,"their light guns, but that doesn't make her any less afraid, and she"
318,"makes slow progress, scrambling tentatively from one hiding place to"
319,"another. Poised close to the mouth of the ravine, she hears a movement"
320,"and spots Exorse patrolling the ridge above. Taking cover, Nanina waits"
321,"for him to move away. Chal and Tor look down into the ravine, Tor"
322,straining to catch sight of Nanina.) 
323,TOR: I cannot see her. She must have got away. 
324,CHAL: She has not crossed the ravine yet. She is still hiding. 
325,TOR: Can you see the hunter? 
326,CHAL: He is going into the ravine. 
327,(Exorse makes his way along the floor of the ravine and disappears from
328,"sight. Still concealed in the craters, Nanina is all too aware that she"
329,"must move on, and quickly, but there's scant cover between her current"
330,"position and the mouth of the ravine. Steeling her nerves, Nanina"
331,"forces herself to scramble forward with more haste than caution, her"
332,fear making her careless. She slithers down into the basin of the
333,"ravine in a shower of stones, alerting Exorse to her position.) "
334,CHAL: He is over there. And Nanina? 
335,TOR: She is there too. 
336,CHAL: Nanina! 
337,"(Panicking, Nanina starts running along the ravine like a frightened"
338,"rabbit. Desperately scanning the rocks around her, she misses her"
339,footing and goes sprawling on the ground. Frantically she claws her way
340,"forward then scrambles to her feet again, running on in blind panic. As"
341,"Chal and Tor watch, Exorse appears on the ridge above Nanina. He takes"
342,aim with his light gun.) 
343,CHAL: Nanina! Not that way! 
344,"(Exorse fires his weapon. Nanina is engulfed in intense light, trapped"
345,"like a fly in amber. By moving the light gun, Exorse can control"
346,Nanina's movements like a puppet. He directs her out of the craters and
347,back towards the city.) 
348,TOR: He has taken her.
349,
350,[Council Chamber]
351,
352,"JANO: Life preys on other forms of life, as you"
353,"know, Doctor. Wild beasts live on other animals. Mankind must have"
354,"food, water, and oxygen. "
355,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, it's quite obvious to the meanest intellect that,"
356,"well, how can I say, that you've found a much more effective source of"
357,energy. 
358,"JANO: That is true, Doctor. We have learned how to transfer the energy"
359,of life directly to ourselves. We can tap it at its source. It is as
360,though we were able to recharge ourselves with life's vital force.
361,
362,[Outside the City]
363,
364,(Exorse and Nanina have left the ravine and pass
365,close by where Tor and Chal are hiding. Nanina is powerless under the
366,"influence of the light gun, and does not react as Chal calls out.) "
367,CHAL: Nanina. Leave her. Leave the girl. Take me in her place! 
368,"(But Exorse ignores the old man, and he and his captive continue on"
369,their way.) 
370,[Council Chamber]
371,
372,(Jano proudly shows the Doctor a complex model of
373,the technology that forms the heart of their society.) 
374,JANO: The energy of life which we accumulate we store in vats such as
375,"these. Then, when the Elders decide that some member of the community"
376,"needs new force, we can transfer that energy directly. "
377,DOCTOR: To a member of your community. 
378,JANO: Exactly. We can give ourselves new power. 
379,"DOCTOR: Yes. Of course, you need a very high form of life to make this"
380,source effective. 
381,"JANO: That is true, Doctor. We absorb only a very special form of"
382,animal vitality. 
383,[City Avenue]
384,
385,"(Emerging from the scrubland, Exorse and Nanina"
386,"approach the city wall. Before them, a tall diamond shaped portal"
387,starts to slide to one side as Exorse activates the opening mechanism.
388,"Not too far away, Flower is proving to be an enthusiastic guide.) "
389,"FLOWER: Don't think we're always serious. We play games, we dance, we"
390,"go hunting. Our life's very happy. We do everything we want, go"
391,everywhere we want. 
392,AVON: Do not go that way. 
393,DODO: I thought you said we could go anywhere. 
394,"AVON: Well, it leads to the world beyond the City. "
395,DODO: Don't you ever go outside? 
396,FLOWER: We're not allowed to. 
397,AVON: There is no need. 
398,"FLOWER: Yes, that's right. Everything we want, we have here in the"
399,City. 
400,STEVEN: What about the men we met outside? 
401,FLOWER: They're the guards. 
402,"DODO: What, to keep back the savages? "
403,AVON: The savages? 
404,DODO: The men in animal skins. 
405,AVON: You saw them? 
406,DODO: They threw spears at us. 
407,"AVON: Yes, well, the guards are to keep these people away. That is why"
408,we seldom go beyond the City. 
409,"FLOWER: Let's forget such a dismal topic. Come, I'll show you the"
410,stadium. There's going to be a celebration there tonight especially for
411,you. 
412,(The tour continues but Dodo lags behind. Through a narrow window she
413,"catches sight of Exorse and Nanina outside, as Exorse forces Nanina"
414,through the door and into the City ahead of him.) 
415,AVON: Dodo! 
416,"DODO: I'm coming. Every time I want to see something, they stop me. "
417,"STEVEN: Dodo, you're a guest here. Try to behave like one. "
418,DODO: I hate conducted tours. 
419,STEVEN: What were you goggling at anyway? 
420,DODO: I saw one of the guards go past. He had a prisoner. 
421,STEVEN: You must be off your head! You wouldn't have a prisoner in a
422,place like this. 
423,DODO: He had one of the savages with him. A girl. She seemed to be
424,moving along in a light that shone from one of those guns they carry. 
425,"STEVEN: Oh Dodo, really. "
426,"DODO: Oh no, it's true. It was like a torch. As he moved, she went"
427,ahead. 
428,"FLOWER: Come along, we're just wondering which way to take you now. "
429,DODO: Why are they so cautious about what they show us? 
430,STEVEN: You imagine things. 
431,FLOWER: What are you whispering about? 
432,STEVEN: We're just coming. 
433,"DODO: We're not going to find out much about this place from these two,"
434,are we? 
435,STEVEN: Come on!
436,
437,[City corridor]
438,
439,(Exorse project Nanina through a series of metal
440,corridors deeper into the City. As they approach a door at the end of
441,"the last corridor, the light beam wavers and moves off Nanina."
442,"Disengaged, she reels and slumps against the wall.) "
443,"NANINA: Please, please let me go. "
444,(Exorse deactivates the light gun and presses a button to request
445,entry.)

447,[Control room]
448,
449,(The chief scientist looks up from his work.) 
450,SENTA: That must be Exorse. He's already behind his deadline. What's
451,happening to security this morning? 
452,"(Two technicians wheel a gurney across the centre, on which a male"
453,savage is strapped. He appears extremely weak and disorientated.) 
454,SENTA: He seems very depleted. What's his vitality reading? Seventeen
455,point four. They took that very low. Can't they follow instructions in
456,"there, or have I got to supervise every transfer of energy myself. Now,"
457,let's see. His recuperative charge is high. He'll recover. Those
458,"confounded guards, they're all the same. They keep you waiting, throw"
459,"the whole routine out of gear, and then they expect you to be ready for"
460,"them the moment they arrive. All right, take him away. Release him."
461,"Help him along corridor KO4, emergency exit. Go ahead. "
462,(An assistant helps the exhausted figure to his feet and leads him from
463,the room. Senta opens another door to allow Exorse entry. Seeing
464,"Nanina, Senta turns to instruct one of his technicians.) "
465,SENTA: Prepare this one. A47. We're behind schedule. We must transfer
466,"immediately. I am filing a complaint, Exorse. You're late. Surely she"
467,didn't give you much trouble? 
468,EXORSE: Of course not. I was delayed by the strangers. 
469,SENTA: You've seen them? 
470,EXORSE: Captain Edal and I were the first to find them. We brought them
471,back. That was why I was late. 
472,SENTA: You've actually seen them. What are they like? 
473,"EXORSE: Very like us, in some ways. "
474,"SENTA: But in some ways, they're different? "
475,"EXORSE: Yes, but I can't quite say what it is. I must be going. "
476,(Exorse leaves.) 
477,"SENTA: Is A47 ready yet? Yes, that seems all right. Tell them to be"
478,quite sure not to take A47 below vitality reading 24. 
479,"(At the chime, Senta activates a control to open the door, and the"
480,assistant who removed the savage reappears.) 
481,SENTA: Is he all right? Let's see.

483,the man moving slowly away.

491,everything. 
492,"AVON: Yes, we're very proud of it. "
493,STEVEN: Why is it only within the confines of the City itself that you
494,have such ideal conditions? What about beyond? 
495,FLOWER: Well 
496,AVON: We've told you before. We have everything here that we need.

512,and crosses to the doorway from which Exorse appeared. She quickly
513,works out how to open the door and ventures inside. The door closes
514,behind her. She finds herself in a darkened corridor and hesitates
515,slightly as her eyes grow accustomed to the gloom.)

534,"(Ahead of her, Dodo can make out a glimmer of light"
535,"and she moves cautiously towards it. She creeps along, heading slowly"
536,for a T junction in the corridors from where the light shines dimly.
537,Slowly she becomes aware of ragged breathing and shuffling footsteps
538,coming closer. The strange acoustics in the corridors mean she cannot
539,"pinpoint the direction of the noises. She edges ahead nervously,"
540,"eventually reaching the junction. Summoning all her courage, she steps"
541,into the next corridor. Dodo finds herself confronted by a male savage
542,"dressed in animal skins. His eyes are wide, staring blindly ahead as he"
543,"stumbles forward. Frozen in terror, Dodo is unable to move as he"
544,"lurches towards her, his arms outstretched. She screams."

551,clear she has nothing to fear. He's utterly drained and appears unaware
552,of her presence. He drags himself past her and towards the door at the
553,"far end of the corridor. The door slides open, light flooding in. The"
554,"exhausted man collapses, and Dodo goes to help him. He tries to speak"
555,"but cannot. As Dodo helps him outside he stumbles, and Dodo is startled"
556,as two more savages emerge from the bushes to help him up. Chal sees
557,Dodo and raises his spear to attack. The fallen man manages to stop him
558,as Dodo retreats into the corridor and the door slides closed once
559,more. Faint sounds of machinery and bubbling noises draw Dodo's
560,attention. She moves back along the corridor to investigate.)

767,"AVON: Yes, yes that's right. It's a hospital. "
768,FLOWER: Perhaps they thought you were a patient. 
769,DODO: I wouldn't like to be a patient in their hands. 
770,EDAL: You must have a reason for saying that. I would like to know what
771,it is. What did you see?

867,DOCTOR: Did he come out of that laboratory? 
868,"DODO: Yes, I think so. What's that matter with him, Doctor? Do you"

870,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, I think I do, yes. It's just as I feared. "
871,DODO: Feared? 
872,"DOCTOR: Yes, their wonderful civilisation is based on this. They've"
873,"discovered a way of extracting life's force from human beings, and"
874,"absorbing it into themselves, leaving the victim, as you see, almost"
875,dead.

887,"EDAL: Do you require assistance, Doctor? "
888,DOCTOR: What do you know of this? 
889,EDAL: He's one of the savages. I shouldn't let him worry you. He's
890,"probably shamming. He should be back on the reserve. Come on, you lazy"
891,"animal, get up, move! Get back to your sector. "
892,"DOCTOR: What are you doing, fellow? Leave the man alone. He'll probably"
893,die.

907,"EDAL: You are obstructing me, Doctor. "
908,DOCTOR: I am looking after this wretched fellow. 
909,EDAL: You will come with me. 
910,DOCTOR: I have already told you I'm busy. I'm going to take care of
911,this poor man. 
912,EDAL: I have warned you! You will do as I order you! 
913,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
914,EDAL: Or you'll know the alternative. You will come with me back to the
915,city. 
916,(Edal draws his light gun and the Doctor is forced to comply. On the
917,"ground, the fallen savage raises his head weakly to watch them leave. A"
918,"while later, Steven and Dodo return with a small metal container.) "
919,DODO: Where were they? 
920,STEVEN: Over there. 
921,DODO: Where's the Doctor? 
922,STEVEN: Doctor? Doctor! 
923,DODO: Now what do we do? 
924,STEVEN: Give him the capsules. 
925,DODO: What about the Doctor? 
926,"STEVEN: Oh, you know what he's like. He'll be back. He's just roamed"
927,off somewhere. 
928,"DODO: Here, take this. "
929,"(With an effort, the helpless savage swallows the capsule.) "
930,DODO: Shall I give him another one? 
931,"STEVEN: Yes, that first one seems to have done him good. "
932,"(As she hands over a second pill, her eyes scan the ridge.) "
933,"DODO: Steven, the savages! And they've got spears! "
934,(Up on the ridge.) 
935,TOR: I'll aim for the man. You kill the girl. 
936,"CHAL: No, we must not kill them. "
937,TOR: They have no light guns. They cannot harm us. It will be revenge. 
938,CHAL: Revenge is no good! And what would the guards do to our people? 
939,TOR: But we must save Wylda. 
940,CHAL: Not by killing. 
941,TOR: If we wait too long he will die. 
942,CHAL: He will not die. They will not let him die. They take their
943,strength from the living. We must wait and be patient. It might be a
944,trap. Come on. 
945,(Dodo watches as the savages creep closer.) 
946,DODO: We must get away. 
947,STEVEN: To the city? 
948,"DODO: No, I don't want to go back there. "
949,"STEVEN: All right. Where to, then? "
950,"DODO: Well, couldn't we get to the Tardis? "
951,"STEVEN: Might be too late. Besides, we can't go. They might have got"
952,the Doctor. 
953,DODO: They're coming nearer. 
954,STEVEN: All right. Don't let them see you're afraid. 
955,DODO: I'll try. 
956,(Tor raises his spear to attack.) 
957,TOR: Kill them! 
958,CHAL: Wait! 
959,WYLDA: Do not kill. 
960,CHAL: Wylda speaks. 
961,WYLDA: Do not kill them. They're friends. 
962,CHAL: Friends? What did you give him? 
963,STEVEN: We gave him medicine. 
964,CHAL: Why? 
965,STEVEN: Because he's sick. 
966,CHAL: We left him to recover. He is not sick. 
967,STEVEN: But look at him! 
968,CHAL: You think he is sick? 
969,STEVEN: Yes! 
970,CHAL: You are from the city? 
971,"DODO: No, we're not. "
972,CHAL: You must come from the city. 
973,"STEVEN: No, we come from another place. "
974,TOR: We have seen you. You were in the city. 
975,STEVEN: We were taken there. 
976,CHAL: You have friends in the city? 
977,"WYLDA: She helped me, and the old man spoke against it. "
978,STEVEN: The Doctor? Where is he? 
979,WYLDA: They have taken him. 
980,STEVEN: Taken him! 
981,DODO: Where to? 
982,WYLDA: To the city. 
983,"DODO: They've taken him prisoner? Steven, what are we going to do? "
984,STEVEN: Who took him? 
985,WYLDA: The guard. 
986,STEVEN: One of the guards? Why would they want to do a thing like that?
987,
988,WYLDA: The old man was angry. He tried to protect me from their
989,captain.

992,
993,"JANO: We do not understand you, Doctor. You who"
994,"have accepted our honours gladly, how can you condemn this great"
995,artistic and scientific civilisation because of a few wretched
996,barbarians? 
997,DOCTOR: So your rewards are only for the people that agree with you? 
998,"JANO: No. No, of course not. But if you are going to oppose us. "
999,"DOCTOR: Oppose you? Indeed I am going to oppose you, just in the same"
1000,way that I oppose the Daleks or any other menace to common humanity. 
1001,"JANO: I am sorry you take this attitude, Doctor. It is most"
1002,unscientific. You are standing in the way of human progress. 
1003,"DOCTOR: Human progress, sir? How dare you call your treatment of these"
1004,people progress! 
1005,"JANO: They are hardly people, Doctor. They are not like us. "
1006,DOCTOR: I fail to see the difference. 
1007,JANO: Do you not realise that all progress is based on exploitation? 
1008,"DOCTOR: Exploitation indeed! This, sir, is protracted murder! "
1009,JANO: We have achieved a very great deal merely by the sacrifice of a
1010,few savages. 
1011,DOCTOR: The sacrifice of even one soul is far too great! You must put
1012,an end to this inhuman practice. 
1013,"JANO: You leave me no choice. Take him away, Captain. And tell Senta"
1014,that we have an emergency. I shall be sending him special instructions.

1019,CHAL: There is nothing we can do. 
1020,"STEVEN: Look, the people in the city are just men. You can fight them. "
1021,CHAL: They are too strong. 
1022,DODO: We are not going to let them do anything to the Doctor. 
1023,CHAL: They have the light guns. 
1024,TOR: They will use the Doctor like the rest of us. 
1025,DODO: What do you mean? 
1026,CHAL: They will take him to the room where the great vats are. 
1027,STEVEN: What will happen to him there? 
1028,CHAL: He will become like us. 
1029,STEVE: We'll see about that.

1036,
1037,"SENTA: This is my laboratory. I'm honoured to meet you, Doctor. "
1038,DOCTOR: Thank you. What's this? 
1039,SENTA: Why have you brought the Doctor down here today? I've no time
1040,"for visitors. We have a very full schedule, as you're well aware,"
1041,Captain Edal. 
1042,EDAL: You will suspend all other work and prepare for an emergency
1043,transference. 
1044,SENTA: But that's out of the question. 
1045,EDAL: The order comes directly from Jano. 
1046,SENTA: You are interested in our work? 
1047,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, interested, yes. Although I disapprove of your"
1048,activities. 
1049,SENTA: I shall be honoured to show you my laboratory when I have the
1050,"time. Well, where is the savage for transference? "
1051,"DOCTOR: No, gentlemen, no, gentlemen. I don't wish to bear witness. "
1052,"EDAL: It's quite all right, Doctor. You will not be asked to witness"
1053,this experiment. 
1054,"DOCTOR: I should hope not, my boy. "
1055,EDAL: Instead you will have the pleasure of participating in it. 
1056,"(Behind them, Jano enters the room.) "
1057,DOCTOR: What did you say? 
1058,SENTA: Do you realise what you're saying? We cannot transfer such a
1059,high form of life. It's never been done. 
1060,JANO: This time it will be done. It will be an interesting experiment
1061,for you. 
1062,"SENTA: But, he's a fellow scientist, he's one of us. "
1063,JANO: You have your orders. See that they are carried out. 
1064,"DOCTOR: I think you have forgotten one thing, gentlemen. "
1065,"JANO: I don't think so, Doctor. "
1066,DOCTOR: My feelings in this matter! I will not submit to your
1067,"nauseating experiments! I am going out of that door, so don't try to"
1068,stop me. 
1069,"EDAL: Go back, Doctor. "
1070,DOCTOR: Let me pass. 
1071,(Edal turns his light gun on the Doctor.) 
1072,"SENTA: You two, strap him to the trolley! "
1073,"(Caught in the light beam, and powerless to resist, the Doctor is"
1074,lifted onto a gurney and strapped down.) 
1075,JANO: Report to me as soon as the transference is completed. 
1076,(Jano leaves.) 
1077,SENTA: Take the readings. Open a special file in the computers. We've
1078,"never done a transference like this before. We'll use channel double A,"
1079,double one. 
1080,"TECH 1: We are ready, Senta. "
1081,SENTA: Very well. Stand by. 
1082,(The Doctor is wheeled into the cubicle.) 
1083,SENTA: All correct. Make the connection.

1092,(The glass cubicle fills with the white gas.) 
1093,SENTA: Prepare for transfer. 
1094,TECH 1: Standing by. 
1095,SENTA: Now remember. We've never done anything like this before. Watch
1096,everything very carefully. Let me know the moment there's anything
1097,unusual. 
1098,"TECH 1: I will, Senta. "
1099,SENTA: Transfer on. 
1100,"(In the vats, the bubbles are small and sluggish, barely making any"

1105,SENTA: Keep it steady. 
1106,TECH 1: Point zero eight. It's impossible. He'll never stand it!

1114,(There are results in the collection vats at last.) 
1115,SENTA: Energy reaction?

1125,SENTA: Wonderful! It's amazing. He must have tremendous strength. 
1126,TECH 2: Twenty one. Twenty two. 
1127,SENTA: Vapourisation is perfect. Everything is working. It's going to
1128,be a classic transference. This is our greatest success. 
1129,TECH 1: One point five zero. 
1130,(The glass collection vats bubble furiously and the thick black liquid
1131,begins to clear.

1144,SENTA: Vitality's dropping. Watch it carefully. Adjust cutout at twenty

1146,(Jano enters.) 
1147,JANO: Senta! Your message was passed on to me. You are to be
1148,congratulated. 
1149,SENTA: It's a perfect transfer. 
1150,JANO: Remarkable. How is the Doctor? 
1151,"SENTA: Reduced nervous tension of course, but in good condition. Given"
1152,"time he will recover, and like the others, we'll be able to use him"
1153,again. 
1154,"JANO: You realise what this means, Senta. If we are able to achieve"
1155,"this transfer successfully, we will be able to do the same with the"
1156,other time travellers. 
1157,SENTA: The young man and the girl. 
1158,"JANO: As it is, they are a danger to us, but as a source of energy they"
1159,could be of great value. Captain Edal. Send out patrols. The two young
1160,people who arrived with the Doctor must be brought in.

1169,CHAL: We can do nothing for him.

1171,CHAL: Obviously you have never faced the light guns. 
1172,STEVEN: What is this place? Why have we come here? 
1173,CHAL: To hide. That is where we live. 
1174,(Chal points to the openings in the rock walls around them.) 
1175,DODO: Caves? You live there? 
1176,CHAL: Yes. 
1177,STEVEN: Like animals. 
1178,CHAL: Like animals. It is the one place the guards will not follow.
1179,Even they hesitate to go into the darkness of those passages. 
1180,"TOR: There is news, Chal. The patrols have been sent out. They are"
1181,searching for the strangers. 
1182,DODO: How do you know they're looking for us? 
1183,"TOR: They have not touched any of our people, and they are still"
1184,hunting.

1186,TOR: He will have been used. 
1187,"DODO: You mean they put him in that glass cell? Steven, what are we"

1189,"STEVEN: Don't worry, Dodo, we'll find him. "
1190,"CHAL: I must warn you, when you do find him he will not be as you"

1196,SENTA: It's down to twenty five. We were very careful. 
1197,JANO: And the energy count? 
1198,"SENTA: That's high. As a source of energy, his power is remarkably"
1199,high. 
1200,JANO: And he will recover? 
1201,"SENTA: Of course, but it will take time. "
1202,JANO: Very well. And now I wish you to prepare for an in-transference. 
1203,SENTA: So soon? 
1204,JANO: The sooner the better. 
1205,SENTA: You've nominated a number of people to receive part of his life
1206,force? 
1207,JANO: No. There will be only one person. 
1208,SENTA: That's most unusual. 
1209,"JANO: This is a most unusual experiment, Senta. It would not be right"
1210,to jeopardise the safety of any other members of the city. I will take
1211,full responsibility. 
1212,SENTA: You're going to take the in-transference yourself? 
1213,JANO: Yes. 
1214,"SENTA: But Jano, is that wise? Anything might happen. We've never seen"
1215,the results of such an in-transference before. 
1216,JANO: It is for that reason that I will take the risk. I shall be ready
1217,when you need me.

1233,TOR: There is no place where you are safe. 
1234,CHAL: Be silent! You will be safe in the caves. 
1235,"TOR: No, Chal! You cannot take them into the caves. The guards would"
1236,follow and then our last refuge would be gone.

1256,STEVEN: It's superb!

1340,STEVEN: How much more of this passage is there? 
1341,"CHAL: Very little, but it is our only chance. "
1342,"EXORSE : I know you are there, strangers. There is no escape for"
1343,you. It will be better for you if you turn back now. 
1344,"DODO: It's no good, Steven. "
1345,EXORSE : Do you hear me? 
1346,STEVEN: What's that? 
1347,"CHAL: It is the last bend. After that, there is nothing. "
1348,STEVEN: Go on. 
1349,[Cave]
1350,
1351,TOR: Where are they now? 
1352,WYLDA: They've gone into the rock. 
1353,TOR: And the guard? 
1354,NANINA: He has followed. He showed him the way. 
1355,TOR: Chal should not have brought the strangers here. They will punish
1356,all of us. 
1357,NANINA: But the strangers helped us. 
1358,TOR: What good is that if they make the leaders angry?

1361,
1362,"(Reaching a dead end, Steven, Dodo and Chal crouch"
1363,in the gloom.) 
1364,"EXORSE : Come back, strangers. There is no escape. "
1365,STEVEN: Then come and get us. 
1366,CHAL: He knows we are here 
1367,"STEVEN: If I can get him angry, he might do something rash. Come on,"
1368,"soldier boy, what are you frightened of? You've got the gun. "
1369,CHAL: He will destroy us all. 
1370,STEVEN: How will he do that? 
1371,CHAL: With the gun. 
1372,"STEVEN: Tell me, how will he use it? "
1373,CHAL: What does it matter. 
1374,"STEVEN: Hurry up, I've got to know. Tell me, how does it work? "
1375,CHAL: They shine the liquid light beam on us and we cannot move. 
1376,STEVEN: Does the beam reflect? 
1377,CHAL: How do you mean? 
1378,"STEVEN: If the light from the gun reflects, does it still work? "
1379,"CHAL: Yes, yes, I've seen it from the water of the lake. "
1380,"STEVEN: Quick, Dodo, give me that mirror. Now come on, get on the"
1381,"floor, both of you. "
1382,CHAL: It's no use! 
1383,EXORSE : You are foolish to think you can defy me. Have the people
1384,of the caves not told you? You cannot resist us. 
1385,"STEVEN: We're going to change all that, soldier boy. Come on, what are"
1386,you frightened of? 
1387,EXORSE: The travellers from beyond time are indeed foolish people. 
1388,(He fires his light gun along the tunnel wall as Exorse advances.) 
1389,STEVEN: Keep down! 
1390,CHAL: Don't let it shine on you. Don't let it touch your eyes. 
1391,STEVEN: Quiet. 
1392,DODO: It's coming closer.
1393,"EXORSE : Now do you understand, strangers? We are masters. "
1394,CHAL: We must go. We must obey. 
1395,"STEVEN: Hold him, Dodo. Hang on to him. This might just work. "
1396,"CHAL: It is useless, stranger. "
1397,"STEVEN: Well done, Dodo. Now for it. "
1398,EXORSE : I will give you no more orders. You will step into the
1399,light. 
1400,(Steven thrusts Dodo's mirror into the path of the ray and the light
1401,beam reflects directly back into Exorse's face. He freezes and drops
1402,"the light gun. Steven snatches up the weapon, turning it on its owner.)"
1403,
1404,"STEVEN: Right. Now turn. Back along the passage. Come on, move. "
1405,CHAL: He has taken the guard prisoner. It is impossible. 
1406,[Cave]
1407,
1408,NANINA: They're coming back. 
1409,TOR: We should not have angered him. What will happen to us? He has
1410,taken them prisoners. 
1411,NANINA: It's the guard! 
1412,TOR: He has the gun. 
1413,NANINA: We're safe. 
1414,"STEVEN: Right, tie him up. Make him a prisoner. "
1415,TOR: You can destroy the people of the city. They can destroy our
1416,enemies. The strangers must be gods.

1419,
1420,TECH 1: Are we to release him into the outer world
1421,as with the others? 
1422,SENTA: He is not one of the savages. He couldn't look after himself.
1423,"No, he will be kept here. The Elders intended to give him the guest"
1424,apartments. He must be taken there. Assist him. Treat him with great
1425,care. He is most valuable to us. 
1426,"TECH 1: I understand, Senta. "
1427,[Senta's laboratory]
1428,
1429,JANO: You are ready? 
1430,SENTA: Yes. I've sent my assistants away. 
1431,JANO: You are right. It is most important that we keep this
1432,in-transference secret until we know the results. I don't wish to alarm
1433,anyone. 
1434,SENTA: Shall we begin? 
1435,JANO: I am ready. 
1436,"(Senta guides Jano to the in-transference booth, a recess partitioned"
1437,off by a glass panel. The panel slides aside and Jano steps through.
1438,The booth contains an odd-looking chair which is connected to banks of
1439,complex equipment. Jano connects electrodes to his temples and over his
1440,heart. He's done this before. A cylindrical helmet mounted on a pivoted
1441,arm lowers onto his head.) 
1442,SENTA: May all go well. I shall switch on when you give me the signal. 
1443,"(Jano immediately signals his readiness, and Senta closes the glass"
1444,"panel, sealing Jano inside the booth. Senta switches on the machinery,"
1445,and the huge vats start to bubble and churn. The clear liquid within
1446,"them begins to turn cloudy, fading first to grey and then darkening to"
1447,black. The cubicle where Jano sits begins to fill with gas. Senta
1448,checks the readings and makes slight adjustments. Everything seems to
1449,be going well.)
1450,
1451,[Cave]
1452,
1453,TOR: We should kill him while we have the chance. 
1454,STEVEN: He's more use to us alive. 
1455,TOR: They have killed many of our people. It will be justice. 
1456,NANINA: Leave him. 
1457,"TOR: Why do you pity him, Nanina? This is the guard that took you."
1458,Think what they do even now to the old man. 
1459,STEVEN: And if we're quick we may still be able to help the Doctor.. 
1460,TOR: It is too late. There is nothing we can 
1461,CHAL: Be silent! What do you wish us to do? 
1462,STEVEN: Show us how to get into the city. 
1463,"CHAL: There is a way, but it is dangerous. It is always guarded. "
1464,STEVEN: I can handle the guards with this. Just show me how to get in. 
1465,NANINA: And once you're in? 
1466,STEVEN: Dodo and I can find the Doctor. 
1467,CHAL: Do you know where he is? 
1468,DODO: We were supposed to go to the guest apartments. 
1469,NANINA: It will not be possible. 
1470,STEVEN: We must try. 
1471,"CHAL: Very well, I will show you. But we must hurry. "
1472,STEVEN: Guard your prisoner. Make sure he doesn't get away. 
1473,NANINA: Good luck go with you. 
1474,(Chal leaves with Steven and Dodo.) 
1475,TOR: The safest way to deal with him is to kill him now. 
1476,(Tor swings a club at Exorse.) 
1477,NANINA: You heard what Chal said! I shall call him back! 
1478,(Tor throws down the club again and goes away to sulk.) 
1479,NANINA: Has he hurt you? 
1480,EXORSE: Not much. 
1481,NANINA: Let me see. I shall make sure it is clean. 
1482,EXORSE: You're the girl I brought into the laboratory. 
1483,NANINA: Yes. 
1484,EXORSE: Why did you stop him? 
1485,NANINA: It would do no good to kill you. 
1486,EXORSE: What is your name? 
1487,NANINA: Nanina. 
1488,EXORSE: I shall remember.

1490, [outside the City]
1491,
1492,"(Hiding in undergrowth, they watch a guard at his"
1493,post.) 
1494,CHAL: The entrance is there. It opens into a passage which leads to the
1495,laboratory. 
1496,STEVEN: Can you be sure? 
1497,"CHAL: Oh, yes. It is the way we leave when they have taken our strength"
1498,away. 
1499,DODO: Get down. 
1500,"(The guard sits down by the door, and placing his light gun on the"
1501,"ground at his feet, begins to eat some fruit.) "
1502,STEVEN: He doesn't look as though he expected trouble. 
1503,CHAL: Our people have been oppressed for so long the guards have grown
1504,careless. 
1505,"STEVEN: All right, we'll make use of that. How close in do I have to go"
1506,before this becomes effective? 
1507,CHAL: Just a little further. 
1508,STEVEN: Right. You two stay here. 
1509,(Steven creeps forward. The guard hears noises.) 
1510,"GUARD: Hello, there? Is that you, Exorse? "
1511,"(Too late, the startled guard scrambles for his weapon. Steven fires"
1512,his light gun.) 
1513,"STEVEN: Dodo, Chal! "
1514,(The guard goes rigid and drops to the ground.) 
1515,STEVEN: Get his gun. 
1516,CHAL: Switch off your light. 
1517,DODO: He's flat out. 
1518,CHAL: The light must have hit his eyes. It is as if he was struck by a
1519,club. He will be like this for a long time. 
1520,STEVEN: How do we open the door? 
1521,CHAL: It's simple. 
1522,"(Chal steps forward to break a light beam across the entrance, and the"
1523,door slides open.) 
1524,"STEVEN: Right. Chal, take this fellow up into the bushes. We don't want"
1525,anyone to find him here. Then wait for us. 
1526,CHAL: What will you do? 
1527,STEVEN: Dodo and I are going inside. 
1528,"(Dodo takes the light gun dropped by the guard, and she and Steven move"
1529,cautiously through the doorway.)

1533,SENTA: In-transference completed. Pressure
1534,"restored. Are you all right, Jano? Jano! "
1535,(The glass panel slides back but the gas still obscures Jano.) 
1536,SENTA: Jano? 
1537,(Senta is concerned. He checks dials and adjusts some controls. The
1538,helmet lifts from Jano's head but he continues to sit motionless.
1539,Finally Jano becomes aware of his surroundings.) 
1540,"SENTA: Are you all right, Jano? "
1541,"(Jano appears distracted. He stands and gazes around the room, chin"
1542,held high.) 
1543,SENTA: For a moment I was afraid that 
1544,JANO: Hmm? What's all the fuss about? I'm quite all right. The trouble
1545,with you people on this planet is that you don't 
1546,"SENTA: What do you mean, Jano? You belong to this planet. You're one of"
1547,us. 
1548,"JANO: One of? Yes, yes of course. I'm afraid I'm not quite myself. "
1549,"SENTA: I understand. You must rest, Jano. I shall give instructions"
1550,that you're not to be disturbed. 
1551,"JANO: Hmm! An excellent idea. After an experience like that, one takes"
1552,time to become adjusted. I suppose my two young friends 
1553,SENTA: Avon and Flower? 
1554,"JANO: Good gracious, no, no, no. Steven and Dodo, the child with the"
1555,ridiculous name. 
1556,SENTA: The strangers? 
1557,"JANO: Oh, strangers to you, perhaps, but I have known them both for "
1558,"(The leader is obviously discomposed. He stares around, trying to make"
1559,sense of his surroundings.) 
1560,"JANO: Yes, yes, of course. The strangers. "
1561,"SENTA: I will leave you, Jano. "
1562,"(Senta leaves, and Jano eyes the machinery with disgust.) "
1563,"JANO: Hmm! So, I'm in this dreadful place, am I? Well, I'll soon do"
1564,something about their equipment. 
1565,"(Snatching up a hefty measuring rod, Jano raises it above his head,"
1566,"preparing to smash the instruments. Then he freezes, his brow creasing"
1567,in confusion. The rod falls from his grasp.) 
1568,JANO: What's happened to me? What's happened to me?
1569,
1570,[Corridor]
1571,
1572,(Steven and Dodo make their way along the metal
1573,corridor deeper into the city complex.) 
1574,"DODO: Steven, there's something wrong. It shouldn't be so easy to get"
1575,in. 
1576,STEVEN: Chal and his people will be too terrified to break in. 
1577,DODO: Surely they should have some security? 
1578,STEVEN: Maybe they thought one guard was enough.

1582,(Edal and Senta are watching every move Steven and
1583,Dodo make on the monitors.) 
1584,EDAL: They're not going to give us much trouble. Just a little bit
1585,further and they'll have no chance to get back. 
1586,SENTA: It looks as though they're stopping.

1590,"DODO: Steven, there's something strange. I don't"

1594,
1595, [Control room]
1596,
1597,EDAL: We just have to coax them in a little.

1600,time traveller number one to the end of emergency corridor U3. 
1601,[Senta's laboratory]
1602,

1605,immediately. This is urgent.
1606,
1607, [Corridor]
1608,
1609,DODO: This is the corridor I was in before. There's
1610,a T junction just ahead. 
1611,STEVEN: Can we get into the laboratory that way? 
1612,DODO: Yes. 
1613,STEVEN: Come on.

1627,STEVEN + DODO: Doctor! 
1628,"DODO: Oh, it's wonderful to see you. "
1629,"STEVEN: Doctor, are you all right? How did you get here? "
1630,DODO: Why doesn't he answer? 
1631,"STEVEN: Are you all right, Doctor? (groan) Come on. We're going to get"
1632,you out of this place. 
1633,"DODO: He's not moving. Steven, give him a hand. "
1634,(Steven and Dodo take an arm each and guide the Doctor back along the
1635,corridor. Edal watches from the control room. He leans forward and
1636,presses a button.)

1662,(Steven desperately seeks a way to trigger the door mechanism.) 
1663,"DODO: Oh, quickly, Steven. It's getting nearer. "
1664,"(As the choking cloud billows around them, Jano enters the now-empty"
1665,control room and watches the scene unfold on the monitor.) 
1666,DODO: I can't see anything. 
1667,"STEVEN: We've got to go through it, Dodo. "
1668,DODO: I can't. 
1669,"(Dodo reels back, gasping for breath. As armed guards wearing face"

1715,EDAL: You! You opened the doors. 
1716,"JANO: Don't be ridiculous, young man. Why would I do that? You seem to"

1718,enemies?

1742,"CHAL: Yes, I've seen many of our people like that. That is how they"
1743,leave us. 
1744,STEVEN: Will he recover? 
1745,"CHAL: Yes, but it takes time. "

1748,(The sound of a light gun.)

1778,JANO: How dare 
1779,(Just as Steven fires. His beam hits one of the guards squarely in the
1780,"eyes, knocking him out.) "
1781,EDAL: The strangers! Just one of them. He's over there behind those
1782,rocks. We'll have to split up and work round the side of him. You take
1783,"that side, and I'll take this. Jano, you can watch him from here. "
1784,JANO: Right. 
1785,"(Steven realises that he's outnumbered and out manoeuvred, and as the"
1786,guard's light gun plays across the rocks above him he crawls away back
1787,into the bushes and out of sight.)
1788,
1789,[near the Valley]
1790,
1791,DODO: Will Steven be all right? 
1792,CHAL: Who can tell? He is a brave man. 
1793,DODO: Are we nearly there? 
1794,CHAL: It's not far to the Valley of the Caves. 
1795,DODO: If only the Doctor would move faster. 
1796,CHAL: You must understand he's not himself. It's as though he were
1797,asleep still. Help him. Do not be angry with him. 
1798,DODO: I'm sorry.
1799,
1800,[Scrubland]
1801,
1802,"(Edal and the guards circle around, closing in on"
1803,"Steven's hiding place, only to discover that there is no one there."
1804,Jano hurries over to them while from his new hiding place Steven takes
1805,aim.) 
1806,JANO: What happened? 
1807,"EDAL: He's not here. He's playing for time. The longer he can delay us,"
1808,the more chance they've got of getting the Doctor to the caves. 
1809,"JANO: Look out, Edal! "
1810,(Sound of a light gun.) 
1811,EDAL: Come on! 
1812,"(As Edal and Jano move away, Steven takes aim once more. He fires, then"
1813,beats a hasty retreat.
1814,
1815,[Valley]
1816,
1817,"DODO: Chal, we've done it! There's your cave. "
1818,CHAL: What are my people doing? There is no guard.
1819,
1820,[Cave]
1821,
1822,"(Nanina takes water to Exorse, who is tied up in"
1823,one corner.) 
1824,NANINA: Drink this. 
1825,EXORSE: Thank you. 
1826,NANINA: Let me see your head. 
1827,EXORSE: I'm all right. 
1828,TOR: It's a pity I didn't kill him when I had the chance. People of his
1829,kind must be destroyed if there is to be any hope for the rest of us. 
1830,"NANINA: We will not save ourselves that way, Tor. "
1831,TOR: You hear her? Nanina protects our enemies. This is a dangerous
1832,"man. What do we do, let him go so he may attack us again? Or do we get"
1833,rid of our enemies to help ourselves? 
1834,NANINA: Chal is our leader. He and the strangers have given us orders
1835,that this man is not to be hurt. 
1836,"TOR: I never trust the strangers, and Chal is not here. "
1837,"NANINA: All right, Tor. I am here. "
1838,"TOR: You would fight for this man, Nanina? How can an enemy mean so"
1839,much? 
1840,"CHAL : Tor, where are you? "
1841,NANINA: It's Chal! 
1842,CHAL : Where's the guard? 
1843,(Nanina runs outside.)
1844,
1845,[outside the Cave]
1846,
1847,CHAL: Help him. 
1848,NANINA: Where is the other stranger? 
1849,CHAL: He will come. 
1850,[Scrubland]
1851,
1852,(Steven breaks cover and makes a run for the
1853,"valley. He's spotted by the guard. Dodging the beams, he unwittingly"
1854,"places himself in Jano's line of fire. Jano raises his light gun, then"
1855,hesitates. Steven disappears from sight as Edal arrives.) 
1856,EDAL: How did he get away? 
1857,JANO: You must ask your guards. 
1858,EDAL: We will be too late. They will be in the valley by now.
1859,
1860,[Valley]
1861,
1862,(The Doctor is being helped up the path when they
1863,hear someone running towards them.) 
1864,DODO: There's someone coming! It's Steven. 
1865,"STEVEN: Get him inside, quick! They're right behind me. "
1866,EDAL: There they are. Fire! 
1867,(Steven takes up a defensive position at the cave mouth and fires on
1868,the patrol.) 
1869,"STEVEN: Get him into the back of the cave, quick, and give him some of"
1870,those capsules. 
1871,DODO: Which capsules? 
1872,STEVEN: Those that we gave to the savage. 
1873,"DODO: Yes, I forgot. "
1874,"(Chal and Tor join Steven outside the cave, watching as the patrol"
1875,enters the valley.) 
1876,STEVEN: Somebody's moving. 
1877,"CHAL: It's their leader, Jano. "
1878,"(Jano is climbing down into the valley, apparently oblivious to the"
1879,danger he's in. As they watch he stumbles and falls to the ground.) 
1880,"TOR: Quickly, fire now. Shoot! "
1881,(Suddenly the Doctor knocks Steven's light gun aside.) 
1882,DOCTOR: Not at Jano. 
1883,"STEVEN: Doctor, what are you doing? "
1884,DOCTOR: You must not harm Jano. 
1885,TOR: But he is their leader. 
1886,"DOCTOR: Please carry out my instructions, and do not harm Jano. "
1887,"(Below them, two of Edal's guards hurry forward and help Jano to"
1888,safety.) 
1889,TOR: It is too late now. 
1890,CHAL: Yes. Take him down. 
1891,DODO: Doctor. 
1892,[Cave]
1893,
1894,"STEVEN: Here, take this. Go on, take it! "
1895,(Steven passes a light gun to Tor.) 
1896,STEVEN: Don't use it unless you have to. 
1897,"DODO: Are you all right, Doctor? "
1898,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think so, my dear. I must have fallen into some kind of"
1899,"a coma. It was as though, as though all my powers were being sapped. "
1900,CHAL: You have let their leader escape. 
1901,DOCTOR: Where am I? Where am I? 
1902,STEVEN: These are the cave dwellings where Chal and his people live. 
1903,DODO: We've got to get back to the Tardis. 
1904,"DOCTOR: No. No, my dear, no, no, we can't leave yet. No, we've got a"
1905,lot of work to do. 
1906,STEVEN: Work? 
1907,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I don't intend to leave these people in this"
1908,oppressed state. 
1909,"STEVEN: Well, you're never going to convince the elders that Chal and"
1910,his people should be treated like human beings. 
1911,"DOCTOR: Yes, you're probably right, my boy. I shan't even try. "
1912,CHAL: Well what are you going to do? 
1913,DOCTOR: I am going to destroy the power that they hold over you. 
1914,STEVEN: Destroy the laboratory? 
1915,"DOCTOR: Yes, precisely. "
1916,STEVEN: But how are we going to get in? They'll be waiting for us this
1917,time. 
1918,DOCTOR: All we need is one friend from the other side. 
1919,NANINA: But that is not possible. 
1920,"DOCTOR: I think we have him already, my dear."
1921,
1922,[Valley]
1923,
1924,JANO: It is getting dark. I want you to return to
1925,the city. 
1926,EDAL: Leave you here alone? 
1927,JANO: Yes. I shall be all right. 
1928,EDAL: I can't do that. I refuse to. 
1929,"JANO: I am still your leader, Edal, and this is an order. Tell Senta"
1930,and the elders that I shall return with the strangers as prisoners. 
1931,"EDAL: I obey, under protest. "
1932,
1933,[Cave entrance]
1934,
1935,STEVEN: They've gone. 
1936,DOCTOR: All of them? 
1937,STEVEN: It's hard to tell. It's too dark. 
1938,"DOCTOR: Yes, I think you will find they've left one behind. "
1939,STEVEN: I'll stay on guard. 
1940,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, there's no need to, my boy. "
1941,"CHAL: You speak in riddles. You say they have left one behind, but we"
1942,"do not need a guard? I, I "
1943,"DOCTOR: That is correct. We'll wait until it's dark, and then I think"
1944,we shall have a visitor.
1945,
1946, [Laboratory]
1947,
1948,"SENTA: But you shouldn't have left him there, Edal."
1949,
1950,EDAL: I was forced to. He's acting very strangely. He's not at all
1951,himself. 
1952,SENTA: Are you sure? 
1953,EDAL: Jano has changed. 
1954,SENTA: That's a dangerous accusation to make. 
1955,(Senta is interrupted as several of the Council of Elders arrive.) 
1956,SENTA: Dare you repeat it in front of them? 
1957,"EDAL: I was ordered to return here by Jano. Elders, I believe we are"
1958,about to be betrayed.
1959,
1960,[Cave]
1961,
1962,"(Night falls in the valley. The Doctor, Dodo and"
1963,Steven are gathered with the savages around a
1964,"smoky fire, listening, waiting. It's not very long before they hear"
1965,someone climbing up the cliff path outside.) 
1966,DODO: There's someone coming. 
1967,(Steven draws his gun.) 
1968,"DOCTOR: There's no need for that, my boy. "
1969,STEVEN: Doctor. 
1970,"DOCTOR: Shush, shush, shush, shush. "
1971,JANO : Don't be alarmed. Is the Doctor there? 
1972,CHAL: It is Jano. 
1973,"DOCTOR: Yes, I am here, Jano. We were expecting you. "
1974,(As Jano enters the cave the savages shrink away.) 
1975,"DOCTOR: Tell your people they are quite safe, Chal. Jano comes as a"
1976,friend. 
1977,CHAL: Do not be afraid. We must trust this man. 
1978,JANO: How do you know that I come as a friend? 
1979,"DOCTOR: Oh, my dear Jano, it wasn't difficult. I knew you were to"
1980,undergo the in-transference yourself. 
1981,JANO: You knew that? 
1982,"DOCTOR: Yes, an unknown experiment. And you're not the type of man to"
1983,allow others to take risks. 
1984,"JANO: You're right, Doctor. And now tell me, what has happened to me? "
1985,"DOCTOR: It's all very simple. You wanted my intellect. You got it, and"
1986,"along with it, you received a little conscience. "
1987,STEVEN: Conscience? 
1988,"DOCTOR: Yes, yes. You see, Jano is now saddled with the sense of right"
1989,"and wrong, which makes him an explosive element in a civilisation such"
1990,as his. 
1991,STEVEN: Is this true? 
1992,JANO: It must be. All I know is that since the experiment I have not
1993,been sure of myself. I have grown aware of the evil that we have done
1994,and I am determined to end it. 
1995,CHAL: You are going to help us? 
1996,JANO: Yes. 
1997,TOR: Your friends would never agree. 
1998,JANO: I know. I will not try to persuade them. 
1999,DOCTOR: Jano has another plan. 
2000,"JANO: How did you know, Doctor? "
2001,DOCTOR: I think it's like mine. 
2002,"(Ignored by the others, Exorse has worked to free himself.) "
2003,CHAL: Hold him! 
2004,(Exorse sprints to the cave mouth. Steven fires too late. Exorse
2005,disappears into the darkness.) 
2006,STEVEN: He's gone. 
2007,"TOR: If he gets back, that will be the end of your fine plan. "
2008,DOCTOR: We must take that chance. 
2009,(Nanina runs from the cave.) 
2010,TOR: Nanina!
2011,
2012,[Scrubland]
2013,
2014,(Exorse is making his way cautiously. Hearing
2015,"sounds, he picks up a heavy branch and swings it, just missing Nanina.)"
2016,
2017,EXORSE: Why did you follow? 
2018,"NANINA: If you betray Jano, what will become of us? "
2019,EXORSE: It is Jano who is the traitor. 
2020,"NANINA: What have you learnt, Exorse? That we are people like"
2021,yourselves. What chance will we ever have if you speak. 
2022,EXORSE: You think I can keep silent about what I've heard? 
2023,"NANINA: You owe me your life, Exorse. I have a right to ask you. If you"
2024,"are against us now, you condemn us forever. "
2025,"(Exorse goes on his way, leaving Nanina alone.)"
2026,
2027, [Laboratory]
2028,
2029,SENTA: I promised Jano that I would tell no-one
2030,"about the in-transference, but now I must. It appears that Jano has"
2031,absorbed dangerous ideas from the Doctor. What can we do? 
2032,EDAL: We can no longer trust Jano. He is not fit to lead us. I will
2033,take command. Declare an emergency. We must be ready for Jano. 
2034,(Exorse enters.) 
2035,[Cave]
2036,
2037,"JANO: Everyone must do as I command. You too,"
2038,Doctor. No one will turn back. And now we must move.
2039,
2040, [Laboratory]
2041,
2042,EDAL: You were a prisoner in the cave? 
2043,EXORSE: That is correct. 
2044,EDAL: Jano. I left him there alone. He had some plan. 
2045,EXORSE: I did not see him. 
2046,"SENTA: According to Captain Edal, Jano is no longer to be trusted. He"
2047,has gone over to the savages.
2048,
2049,[outside the City]
2050,
2051,"JANO: Come on, get a move on there. Come on, get"
2052,along. 
2053,"(The Doctor leads, with Dodo, Steven, Chal, Nanina and Tor following."
2054,"Behind them are several other savages and directing them all, forcing"
2055,"them ahead with a light gun, is Jano. He uses the weapon like a whip,"
2056,"herding his prisoners forward, shouting and cursing.) "
2057,JANO: Come on.
2058,
2059, [Laboratory]
2060,
2061,"EDAL: Are you sure, Exorse, you have nothing"
2062,further to report? 
2063,"EXORSE: Nothing, Captain. "
2064,"EDAL: Strange, very strange. We'll see what the interrogators can get"
2065,out of you. 
2066,EXORSE: Only the leader has the right to send citizens to the interr 
2067,SENTA: Captain Edal has called an emergency. He has taken over the
2068,leadership in the absence of Jano. 
2069,JANO: In the absence of Jano? 
2070,SENTA: We did not expect you back here. 
2071,JANO: Why not? Did I not say that I would be back with prisoners. Bring
2072,in the strangers. 
2073,(The line of prisoners is brought in under guard.) 
2074,"SENTA: So you were wrong, Edal. Captain Edal informed us that you had"
2075,"gone over to the enemy, Jano. He has tried to take your place. "
2076,JANO: Put the Captain under arrest. Both of you. 
2077,EDAL: I demand to be heard. 
2078,JANO: You will be heard at the right time and place. Take him away. 
2079,(Edal is escorted from the room by two guards.) 
2080,"SENTA: We apologise, Jano. We thought that something had happened to"
2081,you during the in-transference. 
2082,JANO: Seal off the doors. 
2083,SENTA: Are we to prepare these savages for transference? 
2084,JANO: Seal off the doors. 
2085,SENTA: What's happening? I insist upon knowing. 
2086,JANO: You will find what I going to say very difficult to understand.
2087,"All the Elders of our city are here, and so is the source of our"
2088,supremacy on this planet. No man easily gives up the means which give
2089,him power. 
2090,"SENTA: I don't understand you, Jano. "
2091,JANO: That is what I am asking you to do. I want you to destroy all
2092,this. 
2093,SENTA: What? The laboratory? The generators? 
2094,JANO: All the machinery which we have used to destroy our fellows. 
2095,"SENTA: They are not our fellows, Jano. They are the savages. They are"
2096,not capable of development like us. 
2097,JANO: How do you know? 
2098,SENTA: All history proves it. The savages are good only to provide us
2099,with energy. The laboratory must not be destroyed. 
2100,JANO: These people whom you call savages are our equals. What we have
2101,"done to them is wrong. If you will not destroy all this, then I must. "
2102,(Jano picks up a metal bar and smashes it down on the control panel
2103,next to him.) 
2104,SENTA: What are you doing? Stop him! 
2105,(Senta dives for the alarm button.) 
2106,JANO: This is our only chance to start life afresh on this planet. Help
2107,me! 
2108,"SENTA: Well, don't just stand there! Use your gun. "
2109,"NANINA: Help, Exorse. It's the only way to help us all. "
2110,(Exorse turns to smash the nearest console.) 
2111,EDAL: Open the doors! We cannot get in. 
2112,"(Trapped outside, Edal and his guards try to break down the door. This"
2113,fuels the savages desire to destroy the laboratory. They turn on the
2114,equipment with an enthusiasm to wreck it as thoroughly and quickly as
2115,"possible. Several of the Elders try to intervene, but they are no match"
2116,for them.) 
2117,"DOCTOR: You know, my dear, there's something very satisfying in"
2118,"destroying something that's evil, don't you think? "
2119,DODO: Yes! 
2120,"(Senta is powerless. The vats are smashed, the energy transfer process"
2121,ended forever.) 
2122,"JANO: This is only the beginning, Chal. After this destruction, our"
2123,people must learn to build a world that they can both live in. 
2124,CHAL: And both sides must learn to trust each other. 
2125,JANO: We may need a new leader. Somebody who can unite us. 
2126,EDAL : Make sure the strangers don't escape. It is they who have
2127,done this to us! Kill the Doctor on sight. These are my orders! 
2128,(The door gives way and the guards swarm into the room.) 
2129,EDAL: Get Jano! Arrest him. 
2130,(The light beam misses its target and Steven stands to face Edal.) 
2131,STEVEN: Stay where you are! What can you do now? The place is
2132,destroyed. Your power's gone. 
2133,"EDAL: You! I should have killed you a long time ago. And you, Doctor."
2134,You have done this to us. 
2135,"JANO: Edal, you have no more authority here. "
2136,EDAL: You. You are a traitor. I do not take orders from traitors! 
2137,STEVEN: Drop it! 
2138,"(Edal goes to fire but Steven is quicker. Edal falls unconscious,"
2139,caught in the blast of Steven's light gun.) 
2140,"JANO: Doctor, we already owe you much. (to Steven) And now I owe you my"
2141,life. 
2142,"DOCTOR: Jano, since you have destroyed the power you held over Chal and"
2143,"his people, you realise now of course, you've got to learn to live"
2144,together. 
2145,"JANO: Yes, but the fear and hatred of the past will only die slowly. We"
2146,need someone like yourself as a mediator until we have become one
2147,people. 
2148,DOCTOR: I see. But in my case I'm afraid that is utterly impossible. 
2149,JANO: The man we need must inspire trust. His judgements must come from
2150,"his heart, even more than his head. "
2151,"CHAL: Here is the leader we want, Jano. "
2152,JANO: This is what I thought. 
2153,STEVEN: Just a minute. I couldn't. 
2154,"DOCTOR: A great honour, dear boy. "
2155,STEVEN: But I can't walk out on you and Dodo! 
2156,DOCTOR: Just think of the challenge to be able to set up the people of
2157,this planet for a new life. You're quite ready for this task. 
2158,STEVEN: You think I can do it? 
2159,"DOCTOR: Yes, I do. And you're the only man who can, my boy. "
2160,STEVEN: Has the offer come from both sides? 
2161,CHAL: You would give us new hope. Our people will become great again.
2162,We will learn to live as equals without bitterness. 
2163,STEVEN: What about Tor? 
2164,TOR: I should accept your decisions. 
2165,STEVEN: Very well. I will stay. 
2166,"CHAL: Thank you, thank you. (to the Doctor) And thank you. You have"
2167,justified our faith. 
2168,(Dodo hugs Steven.) 
2169,"DODO: Oh, Steven. "
2170,"STEVEN: I shall miss you both, Dodo. "
2171,DODO: I shall miss you. 
2172,"JANO: Doctor, for many light years we looked forward to your arrival on"
2173,"this planet. We always knew of your wisdom, but we never dreamed of the"
2174,miracle that it would bring us. 
2175,"DOCTOR: Thank you, Jano. And if ever you need the benefit of my wisdom"
2176,"again, I trust and hope you will allow me to express myself with my own"
2177,"free will, rather than place me in an oven, and try and cook it out of"
2178,me. 
2179,"JANO: Come, Chal, we must summon our people. There is much work to be"
2180,done. We shall await you in our Council Chamber. 
2181,"(Jano and Chal lead the others away, leaving Steven alone with Dodo and"
2182,the Doctor.) 
2183,"DOCTOR: Well, I must say, young man, I'm very proud of you. "
2184,"STEVEN: Doctor, I don't know if I "
2185,"DOCTOR: I know, I know, my boy. Well, go on, you mustn't keep them"
2186,waiting. 
2187,"STEVEN: Goodbye, Doctor. "
2188,"DOCTOR: Goodbye, Steven, and good luck. "
2189,(Steven leaves.) 
2190,"DODO: Doctor, do you think we'll ever see him again? "
2191,"DOCTOR: Well, who knows, my dear. In this strange complex of time and"
2192,"space, anything can happen. Come along, little one. We must go. We"
2193,mustn't look back. 
2194,"(The Doctor and Dodo cross the scrubland to the Tardis, and it"
2195,dematerialises.)
