19,CLARA: Danny Pink is dead.
20,DOCTOR:
21,We're here to get your boyfriend back from the dead. Those are tombs.
22,Water tombs. Why would anyone go to so much trouble?
23,"SEB: You're dead and, and this is what's next."
24,DOCTOR: 
25,A Gallifreyan hard drive. Time Lord technology.
26,MISSY: Do you know the key strategic weakness of the human race? The
27,dead outnumber the living.
28,DOCTOR: 
29,Who are you?
30,MISSY: 
31,"Oh, you know who I am. I'm Missy. I couldn't very well keep calling"
32,"myself The Master, now could I?"

35,
36,(Cyber
37,"Dr Skarosa stomps out of his cubicle, stops by his desk and turns,"
38,"pointing his weapon at Clara, who was hiding behind it.)"
39,CLARA: Stop! You can't kill me.
40,CYBER-SKAROSA: Incorrect.
41,CLARA: 
42,"I'm a target of strategic value. Alive, I'm a tactical advantage. Dead,"
43,I'm your biggest mistake.You don't know who I am.
44,(Cyber-Skarosa scans her with his chest disc.)
45,CYBER-SKAROSA: 
46,You are Clara Oswald. You are human. You are unimportant.
47,CLARA: 
48,"Incorrect. You see, That is what you're supposed to"
49,think. That is what everybody thinks.
50,CYBER-SKAROSA: 
51,You are Clara Oswald.
52,CLARA: 
53,"Clara Oswald is a cover story, a disguise. There is no Clara Oswald."
54,CYBER-SKAROSA: 
55,Identify. 
56,"CLARA: Oh,"
57,"don't be so slow, it's embarrassing. Who could fool you like this? Who"
58,could hide right under your nose? Who could change their face any time
59,"they want? Hmm. You see, I'm not Clara Oswald. Clara Oswald has never"
60,existed.
61,CYBER-SKAROSA: 
62,Identify.
63,CLARA: 
64,I'm the Doctor.
65,"(And just to try and convince us, they put Jenna's name first and her"
66,eyes in the opening titles instead of Peter's.)

70,MISSY: 
71,Look at them! My boys. 
72,DOCTOR: Cybermen in broad daylight? You think people won't notice? 
73,(They
74,"notice, and out come the smart phones to take the photographs. Missy"
75,unpins her hat and puts it on the ground at a Cyberman's feet.)
76,"MISSY: Photos with the big metal men, one pound."
77,(Several coins are thrown into her hat.)
78,"MISSY: Oh, honey! "
79,"(One teenage lad takes a selfie of himself, a Cyberman and his"
80,girlfriend.)
81,BOY: There you go.
82,"GIRL Oh, cool. Cool! "
83,"(Suddenly the location changes to Cardiff, between The Friary and Queen"
84,Street. You can tell because the steps have vanished and a Travelodge
85,"and shopping area have appeared, with Live Lounge on the corner.)"
86,MISSY: New
87,York. Paris. Rome. Marrakesh. Brisbane. Glasgow. Everywhere. Anywhere.
88,Me and my boys. We're going viral.
89,(Missy shows him on her steampunk style smart phone.)
90,OSGOOD:
91,"Would you like me to take a picture? Sorry, selfies are never as good,"
92,are they? And you're having a lovely moment. Hang on! 
93,(Osgood snatches Missy's 'phone'. The Doctor grabs Missy's arm.)
94,MISSY: 
95,"No, just "
96,DOCTOR: Nice bow tie.
97,OSGOOD: 
98,"Bow ties are cool. Big smiles, and now! "
99,(Weapons are taken from pushchairs and backpacks. Soldiers come out of
100,the buildings on both sides.)
101,"SOLDIERS: Move, move, move! Stand by. Surround target. Hold back! "
102,"(Once the scene is secure, a blonde woman walks up holding something"
103,behind her back.)
104,"KATE: Afternoon. You've picked a lovely day for it. My, don't you look"
105,shiny. (to the Doctor) Haircut?
106,
107,DOCTOR: Bit of a
108,trim. 
109,KATE: Might want to do your roots. The woman. 
110,"SOLDIER: Yes, ma'am. "
111,(Missy is held by two soldiers. Kate Lethbridge Stewart addresses the
112,serried ranks of Cybermen.)
113,KATE: Kate
114,"Stewart. Divorcee, mother of two, keen gardener, outstanding bridge"
115,"player. Also Chief Scientific Officer, Unified Intelligence Taskforce,"
116,who currently have you surrounded.
117,CYBERMAN: Human weaponry is not effective against Cyber technology.
118,"KATE: Sorry,"
119,you left this behind on one of your previous attempts. 
120,(She throws down a battered Mondas Cyberman head. A soldier brings the
121,Doctor forward to stand next to her.)
122,KATE:
123,"So now that I have your attention, welcome to the only planet in the"
124,universe where we get to say this. He's on the payroll.
125,DOCTOR: Am I?
126,"KATE: Well,"
127,technically.
128,DOCTOR: How much? 
129,KATE: Shush.
130,Any questions? 
131,(As
132,"one, the Cybermen thump the blue disc in the middle of their chests and"
133,stamp their feet on the ground. Dust is blown everywhere as little
134,engines in their feet start up. Missy smiles.)
135,"SOLDIER: Back, back, everyone,"
136,back! 
137,(The
138,"Cybermen zoom up into the air, and out of sight. Osgood turns around to"
139,see the lead covering of the dome of St Pauls peeling back like a
140,Chocolate Orange.)
141,"OSGOOD: Oh, my God! Is it supposed to do that? Is that new?"
142,DOCTOR: A sun
143,"roof on Saint Paul's? Yes, I'd say that was new. "
144,KATE: There's going to be mass panic. Everyone in London can see that. 
145,(More Cybermen fly out of the dome.)
146,DOCTOR: Everyone
147,"in London just clapped and went whee. Hush, I'm trying to"
148,count.
149,"OSGOOD: Eighty seven, I think. OCD."
150,MISSY: Ninety
151,one. Queen of evil.
152,KATE: How
153,could Saint Paul's be full of ninety
154,one Cybermen and nobody noticed?
155,DOCTOR: Dimensional
156,engineering. One space folded inside another. Bigger on the inside.
157,Easy if you're a Time Lord.
158,"OSGOOD: Mostly deploying south, a smaller number east."
159,"DOCTOR: Yep, but one straight up. "
160,OSGOOD: So ninety one isn't a
161,coincidence?
162,DOCTOR: Of
163,course it isn't. 
164,(He takes Missy's 'phone' from Osgood.)
165,KATE: Osgood? Ninety
166,one. Explain.
167,OSGOOD: Ninety
168,one areas of significant population density in the
169,British Isles.
170,DOCTOR: That's
171,"one Cyberman for every city and major town. It's happening everywhere,"
172,"all over the world, right now."
173,"MISSY: Sweet planet, this. I think I might keep it."
174,KATE: One
175,Cyberman per city. What could they hope to accomplish?
176,OSGOOD: Doctor!
177,(The Cyberman that flew straight up has detonated itself.)
178,KATE: Has it exploded? 
179,MISSY: More than that. Cybermen don't just blow
180,"themselves up for no good reason, dear. They're not human. "
181,"DOCTOR: If it's not exploding, what's it doing?"
182,MISSY: Pollinating. Falling like rain into the cracks of
183,the Earth.
184,
185,[Balcony]
186,
187,(The
188,"Gallifreyan hard drive goes dark. In the Nethersphere, the lights are"
189,starting to go out. Seb joins Danny and the Iraqi/Afghani boy.)
190,"SEB: Well, this is a bit exciting! "
191,DANNY: What's happening?
192,"SEB: Well, to cut a long story short, it looks like we might all be"
193,going home.
194,DANNY: Home? From the afterlife?
195,SEB:
196,"Well, when I said afterlife, I was being a tiny bit poetic."
197,And
198,Nethersphere's just a cool name we come up with during a spit-ball.
199,DANNY: What is this place?
200,SEB:
201,"Well, you have to think of it as a data cloud. You know, for storing"
202,"data. In this case, it's the storage of recently deceased minds."
203,DANNY: We're in a cloud?
204,"SEB: A sort of cloud, yeah."
205,DANNY: And what's happening to it?
206,SEB: What happens to any cloud when it starts to rain.
207,"DANNY: Are you telling me we're going back? What, back to our bodies?"
208,"SEB: And the extra good news is, there's been a bit of an upgrade."
209,
210,[St Peters Hill]
211,
212,MISSY:
213,"The dead are coming home, Doctor. All shiny and new. In twenty four"
214,hours the human race as you know it will cease to exist.
215,DOCTOR: What are
216,you doing? Explain. Tell me now. 
217,(A soldier fires a dart into Missy's neck and she crumples at the
218,knees.)
219,MISSY: Oh! That
220,was nice. Must do it again.
221,"DOCTOR: No. No,"
222,"no, no, no, I need to talk to her! I need her awake. "
223,"(The Doctor gets sedated too, but he manages to remove the dart before"
224,collapsing. Two soldiers gently lower him to the ground.)
225,"DOCTOR: Argh! No. No, no. Stupid. Stupid! No, no. Argh! "
226,(Osgood kneels over the Doctor. Kate phones in the situation.)
227,KATE: The first protocol is implemented. We're good to go. 
228,OSGOOD: You just have to let it take you.
229,(The Doctor pulls her close and whispers in her ear before finally
230,passing out.)
231,KATE: What did he say?
232,"OSGOOD: He said, guard the graveyards."
233,
234,[Cemetery]
235,
236,(Thunder crashes in the black Cyber-cloud hanging over a very neat
237,walled Cemetery. The gates are shut to keep the public out.)
238,TEENAGE BOY: That's weird. Look at that.
239,(Rain pours down on the graves and mausoleums.
240,TEENAGE BOY: How come it's only raining inside the
241,graveyard?

244,
245,(At
246,"21 Wardour Row, in a nod to Dorothea 'Dodo' Chaplet, whom the First"
247,Doctor left in Fitzroy Square back in 1966. Water runs down the gutters
248,and rises up from the drains. 
249,"Down in the preparation room, an undertaker is watching the television.)"
250,NEWS
251,REPORT: We are being told that these metal men are
252,known as
253,"Cybermen, but unlike the accounts we have on file, they now"
254,have
255,the ability to fly. Similar reports are coming in from all
256,over
257,the world. Flying Cybermen are here on a global scale.
258,Ministers
259,are telling us 
260,(The man gets down from his high stool and stands
261,in water which is covering the tiled floor. He looks up but the
262,sprinkler system isn't leaking.)
263,NEWS REPORT: To remain calm. 'These
264,"Cybermen don't seem to be attacking us, at least not in any"
265,conventional fashion. Eyewitnesses have reported seeing them
266,flying into the sky 
267,"(A drop of water runs up the wall, then something bangs inside one of"
268,"the refrigeration drawers, and another, as if the recently departed"
269,want to get out.)
270,GRAHAM: Hello? Hello?
271,(One
272,of the bodies covered by a sheet on a preparation table sits up. A blue
273,"light glows through the cloth. It is pulled off, and Graham runs from"
274,"the Cyberman. It stands, sees its reflection, and stares, then touches"
275,its face in wonderment. Finally it goes to the clipboard Graham has
276,"left on the desk and rips off the top page, which has Known As Danny"
277,Pink written in the corner.)
278,
279,[Airplane hangar]
280,
281,(The Tardis is being hoisted into the air to be loaded onto a jet
282,aircraft.) 
283,MAN: Right. Be careful with it. Be careful. Take your time.
284,(The
285,Doctor is leaning back on a box trolley with his hands cuffed
286,behind his back. A man
287,gives him another injection. He wakes with a start and stands.)
288,DOCTOR:
289,Kate? What's with the handcuffs?
290,KATE: I'm
291,"sorry. In the event of an alien incursion on this scale, protocols are"
292,in place. Your co-operation is to be ensured and your unreliability
293,assumed. You have a history.
294,DOCTOR: You
295,don't have a future without me. Do you think your father would've done
296,this?
297,KATE: We both
298,know he absolutely would. 
299,(Still unconscious Missy is wheeled in on her box trolley.)
300,KATE: Who is she?
301,DOCTOR: Long
302,story. Where's Clara?
303,KATE: Clara
304,"Oswald, your assistant?"
305,DOCTOR: My
306,friend. She was with me in Saint Paul's.
307,KATE: The
308,team's still on site but they've been unable to gain access to the
309,building. 
310,DOCTOR: I want
311,her found and brought here. I need her with me.
312,KATE: Then
313,give the order. As soon as you're on board Boat One your word is law.
314,Quite literally. 
315,(They go up the steps with the UNIT logo on them to the airplane. The
316,Doctor stops halfway and looks around.)
317,DOCTOR: You got
318,"the Tardis out, though?"
319,"KATE: Yes, and"
320,Saint Paul's locked down.
321,
322,[Main cabin]
323,
324,"(Long conference table, chairs, monitors etc.)"
325,DOCTOR: Where are we
326,going? Cloudbase?
327,KATE: You mean the Valiant?
328,OSGOOD: Cloudbase
329,was Thunderbirds.
330,KATE: Too
331,"conspicuous. We need your location concealed, not advertised. From now"
332,on you're a moving target. 
333,(The Doctor looks at a portrait of Brigadier Sir Alistair Gordon
334,Lethbridge Stewart on the bulkhead.)
335,"DOCTOR: Ah, I"
336,"see you're bringing Daddy along, too. That's very sweet. "
337,(An Indian Army officer salutes the Doctor.)
338,AHMED: Sir.
339,DOCTOR:
340,"Oh, don't do that. You look like you're self-concussing, which would"
341,"explain all of military history, now I think about it."
342,"AHMED: Colonel Ahmed, sir. Privileged to meet you."
343,"DOCTOR: Love your outfit, Colonel Ahmed. Are you in the Scouts? Are you"
344,a Man Scout? I didn't know they had those.
345,(The Doctor walks away to get a hot drink from the sideboard. Osgood
346,walks past Ahmed.) 
347,AHMED: It was Captain
348,Scarlet. 
349,OSGOOD: Sorry?
350,AHMED: Not Thunderbirds.
351,"OSGOOD: Oh God,"
352,"so it was,"
353,DOCTOR: My
354,confidence is growing every minute. 
355,(Kate informs the cockpit of their status.)
356,KATE: The
357,President is on board.
358,DOCTOR: Mind
359,"you, me and Sylvia Anderson, you've never seen a foxtrot like it. Hang"
360,on a second. The President? We don't want Americans bobbing around the
361,place. They'll only start praying.
362,AHMED: Not the
363,"President of America, sir. The President of Earth. "
364,(The Doctor sits at the head of the table and puts a large quantity of
365,sugar lumps into his cup of frothy coffee.)
366,DOCTOR: There isn't one. 
367,AHMED: There is
368,now. 
369,KATE: The
370,incursion protocols have been agreed internationally. In the event of
371,"full-scale invasion, an Earth President is inducted immediately, with"
372,complete authority over every nation state. There was only one
373,practical candidate.
374,DOCTOR: That's
375,"your answer for everything, isn't it? Vote for an idiot."
376,KATE: If
377,"you say so, Mister President. So long as you're on this plane, you're"
378,the Commander in Chief of every army on Earth. Every world leader is
379,currently awaiting your instructions. You are the Chief Executive
380,Officer of the human race. Any questions?
381,CAPTAIN : This is your captain speaking. Please prepare
382,for take-off. 
383,"(The Doctor looks around, jaw dragging on the floor.)"

385,[Gallery]
386,
387,(Clara is confronted by three Cybermen.)
388,"CLARA: Well,"
389,"gentlemen. Where to start? I was born on the planet Gallifrey, in the"
390,"constellation of Kasterborous. I'm a Time Lord, but my Prydonian"
391,privileges were revoked when I stole a time capsule and ran away.
392,"Currently pilot a Type 40 Tardis. I've been married four times, all"
393,"deceased. My children and grandchildren are missing, and I assume,"
394,dead. I have a non-Gallifreyan daughter created via genetic transfer.
395,How much more do you need? I'm the Doctor.
396,CYBER-SKAROSA: This
397,information is not proof. We require proof.
398,CLARA: How
399,about my name? 
400,CYBER-SKAROSA: Explain.
401,"CLARA: Well,"
402,"my name isn't Doctor, is it? I don't even really have a"
403,doctorate.
404,"Well, Glasgow"
405,"University, but then I accidentally graduated in the"
406,"wrong century, so technically "
407,CYBER-SKAROSA: This
408,information cannot be confirmed. 
409,(Another Cyberman walks up behind Clara.)
410,CYBERMAN: You are Clara Oswald.
411,"CLARA: Ah, no."
412,I'm not! 
413,CYBERMAN: Your
414,deception is intended to prolong your life. 
415,CYBER-SKAROSA: Your
416,presence has not been ordered.
417,CYBERMAN: Correct. You are
418,Clara Oswald.
419,"CLARA: Oh,"
420,"seriously, this is getting old. Look, there is no Clara Oswald. I"
421,invented her. I made her up. 
422,"CYBERMAN: Born 23rd November, 1986. "
423,"CLARA: Yeah, I chose that date. Always liked it."
424,"CYBERMAN: Father,"
425,"David James Oswald. Mother, Elena Alison Oswald."
426,CLARA: Stories.
427,"Stories. Stories. I made them up. Look, ask anybody who knows me. I am"
428,an incredible liar. 
429,(The Cyberman lowers his head to look her in the eyes.)
430,CYBERMAN: Correct.
431,
432,(He knocks her out with a zap from his right hand.)
433,CYBER-SKAROSA: No order
434,was given.
435,CYBERMAN: Correct.
436,CYBER-SKAROSA: You are
437,not under Cyber control. 
438,(The Cyberman blasts Skarosa and the other two into pieces.)
439,CYBERMAN: Correct.

446,(Converted
447,"into Osgood's laboratory. Missy wakes up on her box trolley, next to"
448,the Tardis. There are two soldiers behind her. Osgood is working a
449,little way away.)
450,DOCTOR: Why are you still alive?
451,MISSY: You saved me.
452,DOCTOR: I saved
453,Gallifrey.
454,"MISSY: Yes,"
455,"Gallifrey too, I suppose. There's always collateral damage with you and"
456,me. It's our Paris.
457,DOCTOR: Gallifrey's
458,lost in another dimension.
459,MISSY: Yes and
460,no.
461,DOCTOR: Meaning?
462,"MISSY: Yes,"
463,"it's in another dimension. No, it's not lost."
464,DOCTOR: You know
465,where it is?
466,MISSY: Yep! You
467,know the best part about knowing? (sotto) Not telling you.
468,AHMED : Mister
469,"President, sir, we're ready for you up here."
470,DOCTOR: Remember
471,all those years when all you wanted to do was to rule the world? On my way.

474,DOCTOR: Piece of
475,cake.
476,(He goes to see what Osgood is working on.)
477,"OSGOOD: Oh, er, it's her little device thingy. I thought there might be"
478,useful information on it. Who is she?
479,DOCTOR: You'd
480,never believe me if I told you.
481,OSGOOD: Cos
482,"I thought she might be the Master, regenerated into female form? Your"
483,"childhood friend, responsible for a number of previous incursions. "
484,DOCTOR: That was
485,fairly quick.
486,OSGOOD: We do
487,have files on all our ex-prime ministers. She wasn't even the worst.
488,"Doctor, there's something nobody's talking about. "
489,DOCTOR: Which is?
490,OSGOOD: The
491,"clouds caused by the exploding Cybermen, they haven't dispersed."
492,"They're still there. In fact, they've expanded and are covering almost"
493,all the land masses. We're all looking at the graveyards. Maybe we
494,should be looking up? What do you think?
495,DOCTOR: All of time and space? 
496,OSGOOD: Sorry?
497,DOCTOR: Just
498,something for your bucket list.

531,DOCTOR: Hatching. 
532,KATE: More are coming. Potentially millions.
533,AHMED: So the rain caused all that in just a few hours? 
534,DOCTOR: It
535,"wasn't rain, Man Scout. It was pollen. Cyber-pollen. Every tiny"
536,particle of a Cyberman contains the plans to make another Cyberman. All
537,it has to do is to make a contact with compatible living
538,organic
539,matter and bang! Full conversion. But if
540,they have learned how to convert the dead. 
541,(He looks at the monitor showing Missy down in the Cargo Hold.)
542,DOCTOR: That's what she was doing. That's what 3W was for. She
543,creates an all-new paranoia among the super-rich about dying. She
544,exploits the wealth and the mortal remains of selected idiots so she
545,can create a whole new race of Cybermen. Cybermen who can recruit
546,"corpses. Throw away your guns, Man Scout, it's all over. How can you"
547,win a war against an enemy that can weaponise the dead? 
548,(Clara
549,backs away from a Cyberman that is forcing its way out from underneath
550,its monument. Then she sees all the others rising from their graves and
551,stepping out of their mausoleums.)
552,AHMED: They're
553,"not attacking, apart from isolated incidents. They're"
554,just wandering about.
555,DOCTOR: They're
556,newborns. Give them time. Why were you there this morning? Why were you
557,already attacking?
558,KATE: Been
559,"investigating 3W for a while, then we got a tip-off. "
560,AHMED: From a woman with a Scottish accent.
561,"DOCTOR: Can't play to the gallery unless there's a gallery, and here I"
562,am. 
563,(Missy sticks her tongue out.)
564,DOCTOR: Dead
565,"bodies don't have minds, of course, but she's been upgrading dying minds"
566,"to a hard drive for a long time. So she upgrades the hardware, and then she"
567,updates the software.
568,KATE: What do
569,"you mean, a long time? How long?"
570,"DOCTOR: Well,"
571,"she must have a Tardis somewhere, so as long as she likes. The past,"
572,the future  
573,"KATE: How long, Doctor?"
574,DOCTOR: How
575,long has the human race had a concept of an afterlife? Turns out the
576,"afterlife is real, and it's emptying. Every graveyard on planet Earth"
577,is about to burst its banks.

587,MISSY: (sotto)
588,"I have to whisper it. It's, like, so important to everyone on"

591,"OSGOOD: Right. If it was that important, why would you tell us? "
592,"MISSY: Well,"
593,"look at me, I'm bananas. (sotto) Come on. Just a wee bit closer. Just a"
594,"little closer. (normal) You know, the Doctor will be really impressed"

609,smells. But don't tell the boys. This is our secret
610,girl plan.
611,OSGOOD: Why would you bother killing me? I'm not
612,even important. 
613,"MISSY: Oh,"
614,silly. Why does one pop a balloon? Because you're pretty. You should
615,have a bit more confidence in yourself.
616,"OSGOOD: Okay. Sorry, I've got work to do."
617,MISSY: All
618,"right, fine. You get on. You get that finished. Would a countdown help"

709,"know who I am, right? (It turns to face her.)"
710,CYBERMAN:
711,You are not the

713,CLARA: Of

715,so much about him?

1059,DOCTOR: How do
1060,we stop it? 
1061,CYBER-DANNY: We
1062,cannot be stopped.
1063,"(Missy beams herself in as Mary Poppins, floating gently to the ground"
1064,under her umbrella.)
1065,"MISSY: Oh, that"
1066,"was brilliant! Oh, I love the telly here, but did"
1067,"you see that? Oh, Clara, you poor thing. You must"
1068,feel like death. Let me pop away the pain. 
1069,(Missy starts to tap at her thingy. The Doctor grabs it and throws it
1070,away.)
1071,DOCTOR: Don't
1072,you dare! Don't you think about it!
1073,"MISSY: Oh,"
1074,"sorry, hon, I'm just getting a bit carried away. It's your friends,"
1075,they're so more-ish. Hmm? 
1076,(Clara picks up Missy's thingy and returns to Cyber-Danny's manly
1077,metal chest.)
1078,"MISSY: Oh, stop"
1079,looking all cross-pants. I'm here to give you a gift. Could you at
1080,least try and be excited?
1081,DOCTOR: What
1082,gift? 
1083,(Missy speaks into her bracelet.)
1084,MISSY: Cyberdears!
1085,
1086,(The Cybermen come to attention and play her game of Simon Says.)
1087,MISSY:
1088,Look at Mummy! Raise your arms. Lower your arms. Raise your right.
1089,Lower your right. Turn on the spot. There are exits at the front and
1090,"rear of the aircraft. Please follow the lights up the aisle. You see,"
1091,"Doctor? The power to slaughter whole worlds at a time, then make them"
1092,"do a safety briefing. Everyone who ever lived, man, woman and child, is"
1093,now at my command. An indestructible army to rage across the universe.
1094,"The more they kill, the more they recruit. Happy birthday. Oh! You"
1095,"didn't know, did you? It's lucky one of us remembers these things."
1096,Happy birthday (as Marilyn Monroe) Mister President. 
1097,(She puts her control bracelet on the Doctor's wrist then backs away
1098,and curtsys.)
1099,CYBERMAN: Doctor. 
1100,(The Cybermen bow their heads to him.)
1101,MISSY: Tiny bit
1102,"pleased? Oh, go on, crack a smile. I want to see if your eyebrows drop"
1103,off.
1104,DOCTOR: All of
1105,"this. All of it, just to give me an army?"
1106,"MISSY: Well,"
1107,"I don't need one, do I? Armies are for people who think they're right."
1108,"And nobody thinks they're righter than you. Give a good man firepower,"
1109,and he'll never run out of people to kill.
1110,DOCTOR: I don't want an army! 
1111,"MISSY: Well,"
1112,"that's the trouble! Yes, you do! You've always wanted one! All those"
1113,people suffering in the Dalek camps? Now you can save them. All those
1114,bad guys winning all the wars? Go and get the good guys back. 
1115,DOCTOR: Nobody can have that power. 
1116,MISSY: You
1117,"will, because you don't have a choice. There's only way you can stop"
1118,these clouds from opening up and killing all your little pets down
1119,"here. Conquer the universe, Mister President. Show a bad girl how it's"
1120,done. 
1121,(Missy drops a deep curtsy. The Doctor rips the bracelet off.)
1122,DOCTOR: Why are
1123,you doing this?
1124,MISSY: I
1125,need you to know we're not so different. I need my friend back. Every
1126,"battle, every war, every invasion. From now on, you decide the outcome."
1127,"What's the matter, Mister President? Don't you trust yourself?"
1128,DOCTOR [memory]: Tell me.
1129,Am I a good man?
1130,DANNY [memory]: (saluting) Sir!
1131,"RUSTY [memory]: I see into your soul, Doctor. I see hatred."
1132,DOCTOR [memory]: (to Robin Hood) I'm not
1133,a hero.
1134,DALEK [memory]: You are a good Dalek.
1135,DOCTOR: Thank
1136,you. Thank you so much. 
1137,(He kisses Missy gently.)
1138,DOCTOR: I really didn't know. I wasn't sure. You lose sight sometimes.
1139,Thank you! I am not
1140,a good man! I am not a bad man. I am not a hero. And I'm definitely
1141,"not a president. And no, I'm not an officer. Do you know what I am?"
1142,"I am an idiot, with a box and a screwdriver. Just passing through,"
1143,"helping out, learning. I don't need an army. I never have, because I've"
1144,"got them. Always them. Because love, it's not an emotion. Love is a"
1145,promise. 
1146,(Cyber-Danny puts his arm around Clara.)
1147,DOCTOR: And he will never hurt
1148,"her. P E, catch!  "
1149,(The control bracelet lands in Cyber-Danny's hand.)
1150,DOCTOR:
1151,"You didn't notice, did you? While you were doing all your silly"
1152,"orders, while you where showing off, the one soldier not obeying. "
1153,"MISSY: No,"
1154,that's wrong. That's impossible.
1155,CYBER-DANNY: The rain
1156,will not fall. (He lets go of Clara and puts on the control bracelet as he walks towards Missy.)
1157,MISSY: Oh? Why
1158,won't it?
1159,CYBER-DANNY: The
1160,clouds will burn.
1161,MISSY: And who'll burn them?
1162,CYBER-DANNY:
1163,I will burn
1164,them.
1165,MISSY: How?
1166,CYBER-DANNY: I will
1167,burn. 
1168,MISSY: One
1169,burning Cyberman is hardly going to save the planet.
1170,CYBER-DANNY: Correct.
1171,
1172,(He speaks into the bracelet.)
1173,CYBER-DANNY:
1174,Attention! (The Cyber-Army spring to attention.)CYBER-DANNY: This is not a good day. This is Earth's darkest hour. And
1175,"look at you miserable lot. We are the Fallen. But today, we shall rise."
1176,The army of the dead will save the land of the living. This is not the
1177,"order of a general, nor the whim of a lunatic."
1178,MISSY: Excuse me?
1179,CYBER-DANNY: This is
1180,a promise. The promise of a soldier! (to Clara) You will sleep safe
1181,tonight. 
1182,(Cyber-Danny
1183,ignites his rocket boots and rises from the ground. All the Cybermen do
1184,"the same. They fly off into the clouds and explode, burning them away"
1185,"and letting the sunshine through. London, New York, the night sky at"
1186,Sydney clears in a roll of flame.)
1187,CLARA: Well. The clouds have all gone.
1188,"DOCTOR: Yes, burned up. Totally burnt. Burnt to nothing. Sorry."
1189,MISSY: Ten zero
1190,"eleven, zero zero by zero two"
1191,DOCTOR:
1192,What did you say??
1193,MISSY: The
1194,current coordinates of Gallifrey. It's returned to it's original
1195,location. Didn't you ever think to
1196,look?
1197,DOCTOR: You are lying!
1198,"MISSY: We can,"
1199,"we can go together, just you and me. Just like the old days."
1200,DOCTOR: You'd be
1201,clapped in irons.
1202,MISSY: If you
1203,like.
1204,"CLARA: Doctor,"
1205,I'm assuming you'll remember those coordinates? 
1206,(Clara holds out Missy's thingy towards her.)
1207,"DOCTOR: No. No,"
1208,don't you dare. I won't let you.
1209,CLARA: Old
1210,"friend, is she? If you have ever let this creature live, everything"
1211,"that happened today, is on you. All of it, on you."
1212,And you're not going to let her live again.
1213,"DOCTOR: Clara,"
1214,all I'm doing is not letting you kill her. I never said I was letting
1215,her live.
1216,CLARA: Really?
1217,DOCTOR: If
1218,"that's the only thing that will stop you, yes. "
1219,(Clara hands over the thingy.)
1220,"MISSY: Seriously. Oh, Doctor."
1221,"To save her soul? But who,"
1222,"my dear, will save yours? Say something nice. Please?"
1223,DOCTOR: You win.
1224,MISSY: I know. 
1225,(The
1226,"Doctor prepares to vaporise Missy, but another energy bolt gets there"
1227,first. It was a Cyberman with a dark chest disc. It points to something lying amongst the
1228,gravestones.)
1229,CLARA: Doctor! 
1230,(They run to where Kate is lying on the ground.)
1231,DOCTOR: Kate. She's breathing! She's alive! She can't be here.
1232,CLARA: She is.
1233,DOCTOR: She fell
1234,out of a plane. The Cyberman must have caught her.
1235,"CLARA: Doctor, she's talking about her dad."
1236,DOCTOR: Of
1237,course. The Earth's darkest hour and mine. Where else would you be? 
1238,(The
1239,Doctor salutes the spirit of Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge
1240,Stewart. It acknowledges with a bow of its head then blasts off into
1241,the wide blue yonder.) 
1242,DOCTOR: (sotto) Thank you.
1243,
1244,[Clara's flat]
1245,
1246,(Two weeks later. Clara is asleep when she hears a
1247,distant voice.)
1248,DANNY : Clara. Clara.
1249,CLARA: Danny?
1250,Danny? Is that you? 
1251,"(She goes to the front door, where a soft white light is glowing.)"
1252,CLARA: Please say it's you.
1253,DANNY: Clara. 
1255,CLARA: The
1256,"Doctor told me about the bracelet, how it can let Missy travel from one"
1257,world to the other. 
1258,DANNY : This
1259,place is dying now. 
1260,"CLARA: Yes, but"
1261,the bracelet can bring you home.
1262,DANNY : There's
1263,only enough power for one trip.
1264,CLARA: Then
1265,come on. Hurry up!
1266,DANNY : Just one
1267,"trip. One trip, one person. "
1268,(A figure starts to come through the light.)
1269,CLARA: Danny! 
1270,"(It is the boy in the football shirt, the one Danny killed all those"
1271,years ago.)
1272,DANNY : You need
1273,to find his parents. He died a long time ago.
1274,(The boy takes a deep breath.)
1275,DANNY : I'm
1276,"sorry, Clara. (crying) I"
1277,"truly am. I had, I had promises to keep."
1278,(The bracelet falls from the boy's wrist and the energy fizzles out.
1279,The white light fades away.)
1280,
1281,[Café]
1282,
1283,(Clara is waiting at a table when the door opens. The Doctor sits down
1284,opposite her.)
1285,DOCTOR: Hey. 
1286,CLARA: Hey. 
1287,DOCTOR: I got your message.
1288,CLARA: Two
1289,weeks late. 
1290,DOCTOR: Not bad. 
1291,CLARA: Improving.
1292,DOCTOR: I see you've got news for me. 
1293,CLARA: News? 
1294,(She is wearing the now defunct bracelet.)
1295,DOCTOR: He
1296,figured it out then? P E figured out there was a way home.
1297,CLARA: Yeah.
1298,"Yeah, he did."
1299,"DOCTOR: Oh, good"
1300,old P E. He'll make a maths teacher yet.
1301,"CLARA: Listen,"
1302,"Doctor. There's, there's something that I have to tell you and, er, it's not"
1303,"good news so just, just listen, okay? "
1304,DOCTOR: I know.
1305,CLARA: Sorry? 
1306,DOCTOR: I know exactly what you've got to tell me.
1307,CLARA: You do?
1308,DOCTOR: You and Danny are together now. That's
1309,"great. That's how it should be. But the old man and the blue box,"
1310,that's never going to fit in. So no more flying around. No more lying.
1311,
1312,"CLARA: Okay,"
1313,"no, that's not exactly "
1314,DOCTOR: It's fine.
1315,"CLARA: No, it's"
1316,"not fine. It, it really isn't fine."
1317,DOCTOR: I've
1318,found Gallifrey.
1319,"CLARA: Wow! Oh,"
1320,"my God,"
1321,(The Doctor sets the Tardis in flight to 10-0-11-00:02.)
1322,DOCTOR: I
1323,"entered the coordinates, just like she said. And I found"
1324,"Gallifrey. For once, she wasn't lying. "
1325,(The
1326,Doctor opens the Tardis door and looks out into the blackness of space.
1327,"He shuts it again and walks back to the console, then hits it hard,"
1328,"repeatedly, making sparks fly.)"
1329,"CLARA: So, what"
1330,are you going to do now?
1331,DOCTOR: Go home.
1332,CLARA: Okay.
1333,DOCTOR: Gallifrey
1334,can be a good place. I can help make it that.
1335,"CLARA: What,"
1336,you?
1337,DOCTOR: Shut up!
1338,CLARA: You won't just steal a Tardis and run away?
1339,"DOCTOR: No, not"
1340,this time. Never again. 
1341,(Clara looks at the Tardis through the window.)
1342,CLARA: Never again. 
1343,"DOCTOR: It's a long commute, so, you know, I thought, with you and"
1344,Danny 
1345,CLARA: Yeah. Me
1346,"and Danny. Me and Danny, we are going to be fine. Don't you worry. You"
1347,go home. Go home. Go be a king or something.
1348,"DOCTOR: Yeah, I"
1349,might do that.
1350,CLARA: Or
1351,"queen, you know. Whatever."
1352,"DOCTOR: Yeah,"
1353,"queen, that would be good too."
1354,CLARA: Yeah.
1355,"(big sigh) Tell you what, seeing as it's goodbye, shall we break a"
1356,habit?
1357,DOCTOR: What?
1358,What habit?
1359,CLARA: Hug.
1360,DOCTOR: Why not.
1361,Within reason. 
1362,(He stands up.)
1363,"DOCTOR: Come on,"
1364,you're on the clock.
1365,CLARA: Fair
1366,enough. 
1367,"(So she stands and puts her arms around his neck, and he"
1368,slowly puts his arms around her.)
1369,CLARA: Why
1370,"don't you like hugging, Doctor?"
1371,DOCTOR: Never
1372,trust a hug. It's just a way to hide your face.
1373,CLARA: Yeah. 
1374,
1375,[Outside the Tardis]
1376,
1377,CLARA: Doctor? Travelling with you made me feel really special. Thank
1378,you for that. Thank you for making me feel special.
1379,DOCTOR: Thank
1380,you for exactly the same.
1381,(He
1382,goes into the Tardis. It dematerialises without anyone paying any
1383,"attention, and without kicking up any dust like it used to in the old"
1384,days. Clara walks away. We roll the final credits but then get
1385,interrupted at the end of the cast list.)
1386,
1387,[Tardis]
1388,
1389,(Knocking on the door.)
1390,MAN : Coo-ee! Hello?
1391,Doctor? You know it can't end like that. Hmm? We
1392,"need to get this sorted and quickly. She's not all right, you know. And"
1393,neither are you. I'm coming in.
1394,(The door opens to let in a flurry of snowflakes.)
1395,"MAN : Ah, there you are. I knew I'd get round to you eventually."
1396,"Now, stop gawping, and tell me. "
1397,(We see that the speaker is a chunky silver bearded man in red fur
1398,"trimmed cap and suit, with a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles half way down his nose.)"
1399,SANTA: What do you want for Christmas?
