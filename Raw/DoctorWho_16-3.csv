21, [Tardis side room] 
22, (The Tardis is hanging in the space time vortex.
23,They have collected the shrunken remains of Calufrax and converted it.)
24,
25,"DOCTOR: Right, let's put these two together and go and find the third."
26,"Er. Oh, I see. "
27,(But he struggles to see how the two irregular polygons fit together.) 
28,"ROMANA: Here, let me do it. "
29,DOCTOR: What? 
30,ROMANA: I used to be rather good at puzzles. 
31,"DOCTOR: Puzzles? You don't call that a puzzle, do you? "
32,(Romana succeeds in placing the base and one side.) 
33,"ROMANA: Well, hardly complex enough to be called a puzzle, is it. "
34,DOCTOR: It certainly isn't. 
35,"ROMANA: Look, shouldn't we be getting on? We've only got two segments."
36,Why don't you go and find out where our next destination is? 
37,DOCTOR: Right. 
38,(The Doctor takes the tracer and goes towards the console room.) 
39,"DOCTOR: Ahem. Romana, I've just decided to go and find out where our"
40,next destination is. 
41,ROMANA: Oh. 
42, [Tardis console room] 
43, ROMANA : Well? 
44,"DOCTOR: Have I got a treat in store for you, Romana. "
45,ROMANA : Really? 
46,DOCTOR: Yes. 
47,"ROMANA : Better than Calufrax, I hope. "
48,"DOCTOR: Oh, much better than Calufrax. You'll love it, I promise you."
49,You'll love it. 
50, [Stone circle] 
51, (A full moon rises over the Rollright Stones in
52,Oxfordshire as a group of robed figures with flaming torches enter.) 
53,"DRUIDS: Cailleach, Cailleach, Cailleach, Cailleach. "
54,(A woman hands a goblet and bowl to the priest and kneels before the
55,altar stone in the centre.) 
56,"DRUIDS: Cailleach, Cailleach, Cailleach, Cailleach, Cailleach! "
57,(The priest goes to one of the stone and pours the red contents of the
58,goblet into a hollow at the side of it. The stone glows and starts
59,pulsing to a heart beat. He adds the contents of the bowl and the beat
60,"gets louder. Everyone backs away except the woman, who kneels with"
61,raised arms.) 
62,"MARTHA: Come, o great one, come. Your time is near. "
63, [Tardis console room] 
64, (The Doctor goes to a closed door.) 
65,ROMANA : Not yet! 
66,"DOCTOR: Oh, sorry. Not yet. Not yet? What does she mean, not yet? What"
67,"do you mean, not yet? "
68,ROMANA : I'm not ready yet. 
69,"DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, sorry. "
70,"(Romana enters, wearing a peach trouser suit fastened with a leather"
71,"belt, and what my dad calls a skimmer - a flat cap.) "
72,"ROMANA: Well, how do I look? "
73,DOCTOR: (without looking) Ravishing. 
74,"ROMANA: That's not what I meant. I mean, will this do? "
75,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, very nicely, I should think, except for those shoes. "
76,(Four inch heels and just a couple of straps to hold the sole to her
77,feet.) 
78,"ROMANA: Oh, I rather like them. "
79,"DOCTOR: Well, you please yourself. I'm no fashion expert. "
80,ROMANA: No. 
81,(She leaves to change. There is a strange sound.) 
82,GUARDIAN : Beware the Black Guardian. 
83,"ROMANA: What about these, Doctor? "
84,GUARDIAN : Beware the Black Guardian. 
85,"ROMANA: What? Doctor, what does it mean? "
86,"DOCTOR: It's a warning, and a reminder. "
87,(Romana hangs the purple platform shoes on the hatstand and follows the
88,Doctor into -) 
89, [Tardis side room] 
90," ROMANA: Doctor, I do wish I knew what you were"
91,talking about. 
92,"DOCTOR: If she'd been meant to know, he would have told her. "
93,"ROMANA: What? Look, I only want to know about our mission. "
94,DOCTOR: What? 
95,"ROMANA: After all, what would I do if something happened to you? "
96,"DOCTOR: If something happened to me? Yes, I suppose you have a point."
97,"Yes, I don't really think it's fair. "
98,ROMANA: Well? 
99,"DOCTOR: Romana, you were not sent on this mission by the President of"
100,the Supreme Council. 
101,ROMANA: What? 
102,"DOCTOR: No, no, you weren't. "
103,"ROMANA: But, I saw. He told me. Well, what am I doing here? "
104,DOCTOR: The voice you just heard and the being you saw in the shape of
105,"the President was the White Guardian, or to be more accurate, the"
106,"Guardian of Light and Time as opposed to the Guardian of Darkness,"
107,sometimes called the Black Guardian. They can assume any shape or form
108,they wish. 
109,ROMANA: Just like the segment of the key. 
110,"DOCTOR: Yes. That's why our mission is so vital. Romana, the Key of"
111,Time is so powerful that it must not be allowed to fall into the hands
112,of any one being. It's been broken up into six segments and the
113,segments scattered through the universe and disguised as other objects.
114,
115,"ROMANA: Yes, I know that, but what I don't know is why. "
116,DOCTOR: Because there are times when the forces within the universe
117,upset the cosmic balance so badly that the entire universe is in danger
118,of eternal chaos. 
119,ROMANA: And I suppose the Key can prevent that. 
120,DOCTOR: That's what the White Guardian said. When it's fully assembled
121,"and activated, it stops everything. "
122,ROMANA: Everything? 
123,DOCTOR: Yes. So that the White Guardian can restore the balance. 
124,ROMANA: I see. And I suppose there's a time like that approaching. 
125,DOCTOR: Rapidly. 
126,(K9 enters.) 
127,"DOCTOR: Hello, K9. "
128,K9: Master. 
129,"DOCTOR: Hello, my dear old thing. My "
130,"(Beep, beep, beep.) "
131,ROMANA: What's that? 
132,DOCTOR: That's your surprise. We've landed. 
133, [Tardis console room] 
134, ROMANA: Where? 
135,DOCTOR: Come here. (whispers) Earth. 
136,ROMANA: Earth? 
137,DOCTOR: I thought you'd be pleased. 
138,ROMANA: I might have guessed. Your favourite planet. 
139,DOCTOR: How do you know that? 
140,"ROMANA: Oh, everybody knows that. "
141,DOCTOR: I didn't tell everybody that. 
142,"ROMANA: I can't think why, for the life of me. "
143,"DOCTOR: You'll like it. It's pretty civilised, on the whole. "
144,"ROMANA: Hmm, oxygen level good. Slight aqueous precipitation. "
145,DOCTOR: Do you mean it's raining? 
146,ROMANA: So it would appear. 
147,"DOCTOR: Ah well, that's what the locals call a soft day. "
148,"(Romana tucks the tracer into the back of her belt, and the Doctor"
149,picks up a large multicoloured umbrella.) 
150,"ROMANA: Oh, really? "
151,DOCTOR: Any one for tennis? 
152,ROMANA: Tennis? 
153,"DOCTOR: Yes, it's an English expression. It means, is anyone coming"
154,outdoors to get soaked? 
155,ROMANA: Oh. 
156,K9: Master? 
157,"DOCTOR : Guard duty for you, K9. We don't know if the natives are"
158,friendly yet. 
159,K9: Master. 
160,"ROMANA: K9, what is tennis? "
161,"K9: Real, lawn or table, mistress? "
162,ROMANA: Never mind. Forget it. 
163,K9: Forget. Erase memory banks concerning tennis. Memory erased. 
164, [Earthworks] 
165, (The Tardis has parked herself by a cart track
166,running through a grassy landscape littered with the raised lumps and
167,bumps of ancient archaeology. Romana starts using the tracer. It isn't
168,raining.) 
169,"DOCTOR: You know, I do believe it's going to be a nice day after all. "
170,"ROMANA: So, this is Earth, is it? "
171,"(He throws the umbrella away, litterbug.) "
172,"DOCTOR: Yes. Pretty, isn't it? "
173,"ROMANA: Hmm. Well, the third segments can't be far away. It's over"
174,there. 
175,DOCTOR: Let's go. 
176,"(Further on, there are fresh holes in the turf where something has been"
177,dug out.) 
178,DOCTOR: Very strange. 
179,ROMANA: What is? 
180,DOCTOR: These are. 
181,"ROMANA: Why strange? They're indentations, obviously caused by"
182,something very heavy. 
183,DOCTOR: Exactly. 
184,"ROMANA: Oh, probably some form of animal. "
185,DOCTOR: Why? They don't have very heavy elephants around here. It must
186,weigh at least three and a half tons. 
187,"ROMANA: Oh more, I should think. "
188,DOCTOR: Would you? 
189,"ROMANA: Yes, judging by the specific density of the ground here. "
190,(Her stilettos barely make a dent.) 
191,"DOCTOR: Yes. You know, I "
192,ROMANA: Over there. 
193,"DOCTOR: Yes, that looks promising. "
194,(It's the Stones on the skyline.) 
195,DOCTOR: Let's go and have a look. Come on. 
196, [Stone circle] 
197," DOCTOR: Well, here we are. Yes. What do you think?"
198,"Fascinating, eh? "
199,ROMANA: What is it? 
200,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a stone circle. "
201,"ROMANA: I can see that, but what's it for? "
202,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a sort of megalithic temple cum observatory. "
203,"ROMANA: Observatory? They're just stones, aren't they? "
204,(Romana sits to rub her feet. Those shoes are very unsuitable for the
205,terrain.) 
206,"DOCTOR: Just stones? Yes, they're just stones. They're all aligned with"
207,"various points on the horizon, giving you sunrise and moonrise at"
208,different times of the year. 
209,"ROMANA: Oh, I didn't realise the people here were so primitive. "
210,"DOCTOR: What? Primitive? No, not now. Thousands of years ago, when"
211,these were built. 
212,"ROMANA: Ah, I see. It's very old, is it? "
213,DOCTOR: Very. And clever. With some of these circles you could even
214,calculate eclipses. 
215,ROMANA: Fascinating. Do you think one of these stones is the third
216,segment? 
217,DOCTOR: I don't know. Try. 
218,(A silver haired woman leans against a stone to watch.) 
219,"ROMANA: Oh, that's very odd. Nothing. (gasp) "
220,"EMILIA: It's been surveyed, you know. "
221,DOCTOR: I beg your pardon? 
222,EMILIA: Surveyed. The circle. Many times. 
223,DOCTOR: Ah. 
224,"EMILIA: Ah, so you noticed it, did you? "
225,DOCTOR: Well 
226,EMILIA: I always knew it was a matter of time before another
227,"professional came in and noticed the discrepancies. Oh, haven't I met"
228,"you somewhere before, Professor? "
229,DOCTOR: Doctor. 
230,"EMILIA: Oh, Doctor. Yes, of course. I have a wonderful memory for"
231,faces. Fougous. 
232,DOCTOR: Fougous? 
233,EMILIA: Fougous. Cornish fougous. You read that paper on them at the
234,"symposium at Princeton, or was it Cardiff? Oh, or was it that fool"
235,"Leamington-Smith. Oh, dreadful paper. Complete bosh. "
236,DOCTOR: Who are you? 
237,EMILIA: Professor Emilia Rumford. Author of Bronze Age Burials in
238,Gloucestershire. 
239,DOCTOR: Oh! The definitive work on the subject. 
240,"EMILIA: Oh, you're too kind, Doctor, but of course perfectly right. It"
241,was the survey of Doctor Borlase in 1754 that brought you on to it.
242,"That's how I twigged, cos when I came to compare the survey of Doctor"
243,Borlase with the survey of the Reverend Thomas Bright in 1820 and then
244,"the two surveys of 1874 and 1911, well, it was obvious, wasn't it. "
245,DOCTOR + ROMANA: What was obvious? 
246,"DOCTOR: I do beg your pardon. That's my assistant, Romana. "
247,"EMILIA: Oh, hello. "
248,ROMANA: Hello. 
249,"EMILIA: What a charming name. What's the origin, I wonder? "
250,"ROMANA: What was obvious, Professor Rumford? "
251,"EMILIA: That there's been a miscount, my dear. "
252,ROMANA: A miscount? 
253,"EMILIA: Of the stones. According to Doctor Borlase, the Nine Travellers"
254,here 
255,ROMANA: The Nine Travellers? 
256,"EMILIA: Oh, it's a local name for them. "
257,"ROMANA: Yes, but there are more than nine stones. "
258,"EMILIA: Curious, isn't it. "
259,DOCTOR: So is this. 
260,ROMANA: Yes. 
261,EMILIA: What? 
262,"DOCTOR: Dried blood, and quite a lot of it. Almost as if something had"
263,had it's throat cut. 
264,(A tall woman in a pink trouser suit thrusts a marker post into the
265,ground where the Doctor is looking.) 
266,VIVIEN: It probably did. 
267,"EMILIA: Oh, Vivien. Doctor, my friend Miss Vivien Fay. "
268,"DOCTOR: How do you do? You move very quietly, Miss Fay. I didn't hear"
269,you approach. 
270,VIVIEN: I used to be a Brown Owl. 
271,ROMANA: Really? 
272,DOCTOR: (sotto) The leader of a Brownie pack. Doesn't the blood upset
273,"you, then? "
274,"VIVIEN: Oh, it'll probably be just another sacrifice. "
275,(Vivien moves off with her measuring pole and theodolite.) 
276,ROMANA: I thought you told me Earth was civilised now. 
277,DOCTOR: Shush. You mean there have been sacrifices before? 
278,VIVIEN: The BIDS are a bit primitive. 
279,ROMANA: The BIDS? 
280,VIVIEN: The British Institute of Druidic Studies. Nothing at all to do
281,"with real Druids, of course, past or present. No, there's a group of"
282,them who come regularly. They all wear white robes and wave bits of
283,mistletoe and curved knives in the air. It's all very unhistoric. 
284,(The aged Professor Rumford has settled herself on a folding camp
285,stool.) 
286,"EMILIA: Oh, I think you dismiss them a little too easily. "
287,"DOCTOR: Why, has there been trouble? "
288,"EMILIA: Well, their leader, Mister De Vries, is a very unpleasant man. "
289,DOCTOR: Really? 
290,"VIVIEN: Yes. As a matter of fact, we thought you were one of his group."
291,
292,"DOCTOR: So you don't have anything to do with them, then. "
293,"EMILIA: No, no more than we can help. All that mumbo-jumbo nonsense."
294,"No, Vivien and I are conducting a topographical, geological,"
295,"astronomical, archeological survey of the site."
296,DOCTOR: How would I see this Mister De Vries? 
297,"EMILIA: Oh, he lives over the hill in the big house. "
298,DOCTOR: I think I'll look him up. 
299,"ROMANA: What, now? "
300,DOCTOR: Yes. 
301,"EMILIA: I warn you, Doctor, he doesn't like scientists. "
302,"DOCTOR: Well, very few people do, in my experience. Oh, by the way."
303,Over there we noticed some indentations in the ground made by something
304,very heavy. 
305,"VIVIEN: Oh, it's probably one of the local farmers moving equipment. "
306,"DOCTOR: Ah, very probably, yes. Over this way, you say? "
307,"EMILIA: Yes, you can't miss it. "
308,DOCTOR: How far is it? 
309,"EMILIA: Oh, only a couple of miles. "
310,ROMANA: Only? 
311,"DOCTOR: Well, I did warn you about those shoes. "
312,"ROMANA: Yes, you did. "
313,"EMILIA: Yes, I see what you mean. They're not very practical, are they."
314,
315,"ROMANA: Yes, well, I didn't realise "
316,"DOCTOR: She wouldn't be told. Look, I tell you what. Why don't you hang"
317,"on here and I'll stop off on the way back and bring you some boots,"
318,right? 
319,ROMANA: Thank you. 
320,DOCTOR: (sotto) Listen. Keep an eye on those two. There's something
321,very odd going on. 
322,ROMANA: Right. 
323,"DOCTOR: Right, I won't be long. Goodbye. "
324,ROMANA: Bye. 
325,(The Doctor leaves.) 
326,"VIVIEN: Oh, typical. "
327,ROMANA: What? 
328,VIVIEN: Typical male. Strands you here in the middle of nowhere with
329,two complete strangers while he goes off somewhere enjoying himself. 
330,EMILIA: Never mind. You can help us with the work while you're waiting.
331,
332,ROMANA: Right. 
333, [Outside the stone circle] 
334, (The Doctor strides over the holes in the ground.)
335,
336,DOCTOR: Farm machinery? Huh. 
337, [Stone circle] 
338, (Romana is holding a tape measure to a measuring
339,stick.) 
340,EMILIA: Is that straight? 
341,ROMANA: Yes. 
342,EMILIA: Jolly good. What does that make it? Twenty eight point nine
343,metres? 
344,ROMANA: Ah ha. 
345,"EMILIA: Well, girls, let's have a breather. Take five, as they say. "
346,(A crow screeches overhead and lands on one of the tall uprights.) 
347,ROMANA: What's that? 
348,VIVIEN: Don't be afraid. It's only a crow. 
349,ROMANA: Oh. It looks evil. 
350, [Temple] 
351, (A man in a robe lights a small incense brazier
352,that sits on an altar with some mistletoe and a curved knife in a
353,sheath.) 
354,"DE VRIES: Cailleach, Cailleach, Cailleach, we come to do your bidding. "
355,"MARTHA: Oh, Cailleach, Cailleach, Cailleach. "
356,(A crow arrives.) 
357,"DE VRIES: Cailleach, Cailleach, Cailleach. Your spirit fills us. Your"
358,worshippers are our brothers. Your enemies are our enemies. 
359,(He takes the knife out of its sheath.) 
360,DE VRIES: Death to the enemies of the Cailleach! 
361,MARTHA: Death to the enemies of the Cailleach! 
362,"(The Doctor arrives at Brewery Row in Little Compton, goes through the"
363,gates and up the drive to Little Compton Manor. A statue of Mercury
364,stands on a plinth in the Tudor courtyard. He walks up to the door and
365,rings the bell.) 
366, [Temple] 
367, (The doorbell is heard here.) 
368,"DE VRIES: He comes, o Cailleach, he comes. The one foretold is here. "
369,(He puts the knife away.) 
370,"DE VRIES: Your time will come, o Cailleach. "
371,(He puts the lid on the brazier and removes his robe. The doorbell
372,rings again.) 
373, [Hallway] 
374, (De Vries puts on his jacket and adjusts his tie.)
375,
376,DOCTOR : Anybody there? 
377,DE VRIES: Our friend's impatient. Don't let's keep him waiting. 
378, [Entrance hall] 
379, (A lovely period piece with a wooden staircase
380,"leading up, an old table, chairs and carved settle, period portraits on"
381,the left wall but some spaces where others have been removed. The
382,chandelier has been converted to electricity.) 
383,DOCTOR: Hello? Anybody home? Any? Nobody home except us Druids. 
384,(The Doctor reads the label on one portrait.) 
385,"DOCTOR: Thomas Borlase 1701 to 1754. Oh. Oh, so that's the good doctor."
386,
387,"DE VRIES: He surveyed the Nine Travellers, but then you probably know"
388,"that already, Doctor. "
389,DOCTOR: Mister De Vries. 
390,DE VRIES: Correct. 
391,DOCTOR: How did you know my name? 
392,DE VRIES: It was very sad about Doctor Borlase. 
393,DOCTOR: What? 
394,DE VRIES: Didn't Professor Rumford tell you? 
395,DOCTOR: No. 
396,DE VRIES: One of the stones fell on him just after he completed his
397,survey. 
398,DOCTOR: What? Maybe we should warn the Professor. 
399,DE VRIES: She's quite safe. 
400,DOCTOR: Ah. What about them? 
401,"DE VRIES: Those are away being cleaned. One of them's rather fine, by"
402,the Scottish painter Ramsey. Lady Morgana Montcalm. Perhaps you've
403,heard of her? 
404,(Vivien? Morgana? Uh oh. We must be in Cornwall.) 
405,"DOCTOR: No, I'm afraid I haven't. "
406,"DE VRIES: The Montcalms owned this land and this house, including the"
407,circle. They used to call her the wicked Lady Montcalm. 
408,DOCTOR: Really? 
409,DE VRIES: She's said to have murdered her husband on her wedding night.
410,
411,(Second empty space.) 
412,DE VRIES: That's Mrs Trefusis. She was a recluse. She lived here for
413,sixty years and never saw a soul. 
414,"(Yup, that clinches it.) "
415,DOCTOR: Really. 
416,"DE VRIES: And that's a Brazilian lady, or would be if she were here."
417,Senora Camara. 
418,DOCTOR: Hmm. Was there a Senor Camara? 
419,DE VRIES: He doesn't seem to have survived the crossing from Brazil.
420,"But don't let's stand about here in the hall, Doctor. Do come in. Let"
421,me offer you a glass of sherry. 
422,"DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, thank you. I'd like that. "
423,(They go into the room on the right.) 
424, [Stone circle] 
425, (There are lots of crows in the air.) 
426,ROMANA: They've been circling all afternoon. 
427,"EMILIA: Well, girls, time to pack up. Thanks for all your help, Romana."
428,Fancy a mug of tea and some sandwiches? 
429,"ROMANA: Well, I "
430,VIVIEN: Please do. My cottage is just over the hill. 
431,"ROMANA: I think I'd better wait here for the Doctor, otherwise he won't"
432,know where I am. 
433,"EMILIA: Oh well, please yourself, girl, but if you change your mind,"
434,we're not far away. 
435,VIVIEN: Bring your friend along with you when he gets back. 
436,ROMANA: All right. 
437,"VIVIEN: Good. See you later, then. "
438,(Emilia and Vivien leaves. Romana gets out the tracer and walks round
439,the stones. Not a single click.) 
440, [Study] 
441, (A raven sits on a perch while they sip their
442,sherry.) 
443,"DOCTOR: That's rather an unusual pet, isn't it? "
444,"DE VRIES: It's not exactly what you'd call a pet, Doctor. "
445,"DOCTOR: You know, Mister De Vries, you never told me how you knew my"
446,name. 
447,"DE VRIES: Didn't I, Doctor? "
448,DOCTOR: No. 
449,DE VRIES: You never told me what your interest in the circle is. 
450,DOCTOR: That's true. I'm looking for something. 
451,DE VRIES: What? 
452,DOCTOR: Part of a key. 
453,DE VRIES: A key to what? 
454,"DOCTOR: Oh, it's just a key. It's been mislaid. Tell me, you're not"
455,"really a Druid, are you. "
456,"DE VRIES: Not in the conventional sense, no, but I am a humble student"
457,of Druidic lore. 
458,DOCTOR: That must be very boring. 
459,DE VRIES: Boring? What do you mean? 
460,"DOCTOR: Well, I mean there's so little of it that's historically"
461,"reliable, is there. The odd mention in Julius Caesar, Tacitus, no great"
462,detail. I always thought that Druidism was founded by John Aubrey in
463,"the seventeenth century as a joke. He had a great sense of humour, John"
464,Aubrey. 
465,DE VRIES: It is no laughing matter. 
466,"DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, well that's a pity. What's your interest in the stones?"
467,
468,DE VRIES: The stones are sacred. 
469,DOCTOR: To whom? 
470,DE VRIES: To one who is mighty and all-powerful. To the Goddess. 
471,DOCTOR: The Goddess? What goddess is that? 
472,"DE VRIES: She has many names. Morrigu, Nermintana, the Cailleach. "
473,"DOCTOR: Ah, Celtic, of course. "
474,"DE VRIES: Goddess of war, death and magic. Beware the raven or the"
475,"crow, Doctor. They are her eyes. "
476,"DOCTOR: (to Quoth, the raven) You don't really believe that, do you,"
477,hmm? 
478,"DE VRIES: I have seen her power, Doctor. Come. "
479,(A figure dressed in a bird mask and feathered costume appears. The
480,Doctor walks forward and De Vries hits him on the back of the head. It
481,all goes black for the Doctor.) 
482,DE VRIES: His blood is still warm. I know what to do. 
483, [Stone circle] 
484, DOCTOR: : Romana! 
485,"ROMANA: Doctor, where have you been? "
486,(But there is no one there.) 
487,ROMANA: Doctor? Are you all right? 
488,(Romana throws away her shoes and goes off barefoot through the wild
489,flowers.) 
490, [Cliff edge] 
491, DOCTOR : Romana! Romana! 
492,(She arrives at the edge of a cliff. The sign says Danger Cliff Edge
493,Unsafe. Romana looks down onto the jagged rocks and roiling water
494,below.) 
495,ROMANA: Doctor? Where are you? 
496,DOCTOR : Romana! 
497,"ROMANA: Doctor, what's the matter? "
498,"(We don't see why, but Romana steps back from something, and falls over"
499,the cliff with a scream.) 
500, Part Two
501,
502, [Cliff edge] 
503, (Romana has managed to break her fall by grapping
504,onto the crumbling cliff face.) 
505,ROMANA: Help! Help! 
506, [Stone circle] 
507," (Night has fallen, and the coven has gathered. The"
508,Doctor is lying unconscious on the altar stone.) 
509,DE VRIES: Bind him to the stone. 
510,"MARTHA: Leonard, I don't like this. "
511,DE VRIES: It is the will of the Cailleach. 
512,MARTHA: It's murder! 
513,DE VRIES: We cannot question the will of the Goddess. 
514,"MARTHA: Leonard, think. Think what you're doing. "
515,"(De Vries holds up the curved sword. It ought to be a small sickle, if"
516,he's a Druid.) 
517,DE VRIES: The Cailleach demands blood. 
518,MARTHA: She's never demanded a human sacrifice before. 
519,DE VRIES: I dare not oppose her will. I dare not. 
520,"MARTHA: If it's her will, where is she? Why isn't she here? "
521,DE VRIES: She will come. 
522,"MARTHA: Leonard, this man may be missed. He must have friends. Surely,"
523,if they inform the police 
524,DE VRIES: The Cailleach will have foreseen everything. We must have
525,faith. She will come. 
526, [Cliff edge] 
527," ROMANA: Help! Help me, somebody! Help me! "
528, [Stone circle] 
529, DOCTOR: Hello. I hope that knife's been properly
530,sterilised. 
531,DE VRIES: Blasphemer. 
532,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. You can catch all sorts of things off a dirty"
533,"knife, you know. Lockjaw, tetanus, not to mentions staphylococcal"
534,infections 
535,MARTHA: I'm not going to be a party to this. 
536,DOCTOR: Good for you. 
537,DE VRIES: Then don't be. 
538,DOCTOR: Hold it. Does your Cailleach ride a bicycle? 
539,DE VRIES: Bicycle? 
540,DOCTOR: Yes. 
541,DE VRIES: You'll die with blasphemy on your lips. 
542,"DOCTOR: It's just that I can see a bicycle approaching, unless I'm very"
543,much mistaken. Over here! 
544, [Outside the stone circle] 
545, DOCTOR : Help! Over here! 
546,EMILIA: Hang on! I'm coming! 
547, [Stone circle] 
548, (The so-called Druids flee in their cars. Emilia's
549,bicycle lamp illuminates the Doctor.) 
550,DOCTOR: Phew. 
551,"EMILIA: Good grief, man. What are you doing? You'll catch your death of"
552,cold. 
553,"DOCTOR: Well, you know how it is, Professor. I often get tied up in my"
554,job. 
555,(Emilia draws a knife to free him.) 
556,DOCTOR: Careful. 
557,EMILIA: Who were those people? They looked as if they were going to cut
558,your throat. 
559,"DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. Well, I don't think they'd quite made up their"
560,"minds, but that was definitely one of their options. Why have you come"
561,back? 
562,EMILIA: I came back to give Romana a flask of tea. Knowing how
563,"irresponsible men are, I thought she'd still be waiting for you. "
564,DOCTOR: But I thought she was with you. 
565,"EMILIA: No, she stayed behind to wait for you. "
566,DOCTOR: What? Then where is she? 
567, [Cliff edge] 
568, ROMANA: Help! Help! Is anybody there? 
569, [Stone circle] 
570, DOCTOR: Romana! Romana! Nothing. 
571,"EMILIA: I don't want to be alarmist, but if she's lost on the moor,"
572,there are several old mine workings. 
573,(A dog barks nearby.) 
574,EMILIA: It can be very dangerous in the dark. 
575,"DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. Ro! Look. "
576,"EMILIA: Oh, her shoes. "
577,DOCTOR: Yes. Romana! 
578,"EMILIA: Well, the only thing we can do is to organise a search party in"
579,"the morning. Of course, if we had a dog "
580,"DOCTOR: Dog! Professor Rumford. May I call you Emilia? Emilia, you're a"
581,genius. 
582,EMILIA: You have a dog? 
583,DOCTOR: Have I got a dog. 
584,(The Doctor blows his dog whistle.) 
585,"EMILIA: Oh, that's one of those high frequency whistles, isn't it. "
586,"DOCTOR: Yeah, something like that. Come on, K9. "
587, [Tardis] 
588, K9: Master. 
589, [Stone circle] 
590," DOCTOR: Look, I'll try and meet him halfway. You"
591,stay here in case Romana comes back. 
592,"EMILIA: Yes, of course. Doctor? "
593,DOCTOR: Yes? 
594,"EMILIA: It's getting rather exciting, isn't it? "
595,"DOCTOR: What? Yes, yes, of course. Let's hope it doesn't get too"
596,"exciting, eh? "
597, [Outside the stone circle] 
598, K9: Master. 
599,"DOCTOR: Shush. What? K9, why don't you bark or something? "
600,"K9: I'm not programmed to bark, master. "
601,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, listen, never mind about that. I've got a job for"
602,"you. Now, you've always wanted to be a bloodhound "
603,"K9: Negative, master. "
604,"DOCTOR: Yes, you have. Yes, you have. "
605,K9: Negative. 
606,DOCTOR: Shush. Now here's your chance. Find Romana. 
607,"K9: Programme achievable, master. The mistress' scent, blood, tissue"
608,type and alpha wave patterns are all recorded in my databanks. 
609,"DOCTOR: Don't just talk about it, K9, do it. Do it! "
610,"K9: Getting direction, master. I have the direction, master. "
611,"DOCTOR: Good dog. Good dog. Well, go. "
612, [Cliff edge] 
613, K9: Mistress? 
614,"ROMANA: Oh, K9, I am pleased to hear you. "
615,"K9: Fear is unnecessary, mistress. We shall rescue you. The Doctor"
616,master is with me. 
617,"ROMANA: Oh, no! "
618,"DOCTOR : Romana, where are you? "
619,ROMANA: Keep away! 
620,DOCTOR: What? What are you talking about? 
621,"ROMANA: K9, watch him. "
622,"DOCTOR: Stop messing about down there. Here, catch hold of this. "
623,"ROMANA: Oh no, I'm not giving you a second chance. "
624,"DOCTOR: Stop messing around down there. Come on, come on. "
625,(The Doctor throws the end of his scarf down to her.) 
626,DOCTOR: Come on. 
627,ROMANA: You pushed me over the edge. 
628,DOCTOR: Me? Never. Come on. Come on. 
629,(Romana grabs hold of the scarf and starts to climb back up. Once back
630,"on the cliff top, she pushes the Doctor away.) "
631,ROMANA: Get away from me! 
632,DOCTOR: What's the matter? 
633,ROMANA: Who are you? 
634,"DOCTOR: What? You know very well who I. K9, who am I? Well, go on, K9."
635,Tell her who I am. K9? 
636,K9: Cross checking. You are the Doctor master. 
637,DOCTOR: There you are. I'm the Doctor. 
638,"ROMANA: Well if you didn't push me over this cliff, then who did? And"
639,"believe me, it was no projection. You were solid. Well, it was solid. "
640,"DOCTOR: What, it looked exactly like me? "
641,"ROMANA: The image of you. Doctor, the third segment. "
642,DOCTOR: Yes. 
643,"ROMANA: The power to transform objects, or at least their appearance. "
644,DOCTOR: Yes. 
645,"ROMANA: Somebody's got it, and they've found a way of utilising its"
646,powers. 
647,DOCTOR: Right. 
648,"ROMANA: Well, so what do we do? "
649,DOCTOR: Get you a decent pair of shoes. 
650, [Tardis] 
651, (The Doctor is pacing. Romana eventually enters
652,wearing a midi-skirt and almost completely sensible boots.) 
653,DOCTOR: Better? 
654,"ROMANA: Yes, thanks. "
655,DOCTOR: Still got the tracer. 
656,ROMANA: Of course. 
657,DOCTOR: Good. I want you to check the stone circle again. 
658,ROMANA: What do you think I was doing before you pushed me over the.
659,"All right. There was no trace, I promise you. "
660,"DOCTOR: Well, it's got to be somewhere. "
661,"ROMANA: Well, it can't be there. "
662,"DOCTOR: Well, of course it can. How's your interspatial geometry? "
663,"ROMANA: Well, pretty rusty, but I still don't see how that explains "
664,"DOCTOR: Good. Come on, let's go then. "
665,(The Doctor leaves.) 
666,"ROMANA: Do you understand, K9? I mean, how can a thing be in one place"
667,and yet not be in that place? 
668,(K9 whirrs and waggles his radar dishes for several seconds.) 
669,"ROMANA: If you mean you don't know, why don't you just say so. "
670, [Stone circle] 
671, (Vivien offers Emilia a mug of tea from a flask.) 
672,"VIVIEN: Oh, Emilia, don't blame yourself. "
673,(Emilia refuses it.) 
674,"EMILIA: Oh, I shouldn't have let him go off on his own. I shouldn't"
675,have let him go at all. He doesn't know the moor. I should have gone
676,myself. 
677,VIVIEN: Someone had to stay here in case the girl came back. 
678,EMILIA: And it should have been the Doctor. 
679, [Outside the stone circle] 
680, DOCTOR: Try the tracer again. Now. 
681,(Romana takes the tracer from her boot. It crackles.) 
682,ROMANA: Yes. Definitely positive. 
683,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's what I thought. "
684, [Stone circle] 
685, VIVIEN: I'm sure the Doctor's perfectly capable of
686,looking after himself. 
687,ROMANA: I'm not sure I'd entirely agree with that remark. 
688,"EMILIA: Oh! Thank heavens. You're safe. Doctor, she's safe. Good.."
689,what's that? 
690,DOCTOR: This is my dog. He's called K9. 
691,EMILIA: But he's mechanical! 
692,K9: Affirmative. 
693,EMILIA: But isn't that rather 
694,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. They're all the rage in Trenton, New Jersey. "
695,"EMILIA: Oh, really? "
696,DOCTOR: Yes. 
697,EMILIA: Do you have to have a licence? 
698,DOCTOR: No. 
699,K9: Negative. 
700,(The tracer crackles.) 
701,VIVIEN: What's that? 
702,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's just a little gadget. "
703,"ROMANA: Doctor, it's here. It's definitely here. "
704,VIVIEN: What is? 
705,DOCTOR: Here somewhere. 
706,ROMANA: I still don't understand. 
707,"DOCTOR: I think I'm beginning to. Professor Rumford, er, Emilia? Come"
708,over here. 
709,(They stand a little way away from Vivien and speak softly.) 
710,"DOCTOR: You've done a lot of research on the circle, haven't you? "
711,"EMILIA: Oh, naturally. "
712,"DOCTOR: Legends, folklore, history? "
713,EMILIA: Nobody's ever had to question the quality of my research. 
714,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. Where do you keep your notes? "
715,"EMILIA: Oh, back at Miss Fay's cottage. "
716,DOCTOR: Would you show them to Romana? 
717,"EMILIA: Oh, I'd be delighted. "
718,DOCTOR: Good. 
719,"ROMANA: Where are you going, Doctor? "
720,DOCTOR: I'm going to see Mister De Vries. 
721,"ROMANA: What, after what he did to you? "
722,DOCTOR: Because of what he did to me. I think that Mister De Vries is a
723,"very worried man, and worried men often sing worried songs. Come along,"
724,K9. 
725,"EMILIA: Come on, girls. Back to the cottage. I've got lots of research"
726,to show you. Hop on the back. 
727,"ROMANA: Er, do you mind if I just walked? "
728,"EMILIA: Oh, nonsense. You may find it rather hard. "
729,VIVIEN: It'll be a new experience for you. No need to be afraid. 
730, [Study] 
731, DE VRIES: Where's the bird? Where's the raven? 
732,MARTHA: It was here. Perhaps 
733,"DE VRIES: It's gone! Too late! Cailleach, great Goddess, have mercy! "
734,MARTHA: What's that? 
735,DE VRIES: Too late! 
736,(A glowing standing stone glides past the window.) 
737,"DE VRIES: Get out of here, Martha. As fast as you can. Quick! "
738,"MARTHA: Leonard, I'm not going to leave you. "
739,(Crashing and smashing of glass.) 
740,DE VRIES: Go! 
741, [Outside the Manor House] 
742," K9: Danger, master, danger. "
743,DOCTOR: What? 
744,(Breaking glass some way off.) 
745,K9: Unidentified aliens. 
746,(Martha screams.) 
747,"DOCTOR: Come on, K9. "
748, [Entrance hall] 
749, (The place is a mess. Both De Vries and Martha lie
750,amongst the smashed pieces of furniture.) 
751,DOCTOR: Dead. Skull smashed to pulp. So much for serving the Cailleach.
752,
753,K9: Master. 
754,DOCTOR: What? 
755,(K9 points to a pile of white powder on the flagstones.) 
756,"K9: That is silicon, master. "
757,DOCTOR: I wonder where that came from? 
758,K9: From whatever attacked those two humans. There is a trail. It leads
759,through here. 
760,"DOCTOR: Steady, K9. "
761, [Study] 
762, (Another picture of splintered woodwork.) 
763,DOCTOR: Shush. 
764,(A French window is open. The Doctor looks outside then closes it.) 
765,"DOCTOR: Seems all clear, K9. "
766,K9: Master? 
767,(The stone appears outside and knocks the French windows in onto the
768,Doctor. K9 fires at it. It growls and retreats. K9 follows. After a few
769,"moments, the Doctor comes round.) "
770,DOCTOR: Stone. K9? 
771,(Sounds of K9's laser outside.) 
772,DOCTOR: K9? 
773, [Vivien's cottage] 
774, (A traditional timber framed place with chintz
775,comfy chairs. Emilia brings in a mug of tea as Romana studies her
776,writings.) 
777,"EMILIA: Here you are, my girl. "
778,"ROMANA: Oh, thank you. "
779,EMILIA: Vivien is making some sausage sandwiches. Nothing like sausage
780,"sandwiches when you're working something out. Well now, any problems"
781,with the notes? 
782,"ROMANA: No, no, they're very full. Er, you say here that you've"
783,"identified the Nine Travellers, our stone circle, as one of the three"
784,gorsedds of prophecy. What's a gorsedd? 
785,"EMILIA: Old Welsh. A gorsedd is a place of augurs, people who foretell"
786,the future. 
787,ROMANA: Ah. 
788,"EMILIA: There's an ancient Welsh triad that says, it's a three line"
789,"poem, umpity, bumpity. Oh, you'll find them in the notes. "
790,VIVIEN: The three gorsedds in the island of Britain are the gorsedd of
791,Salisbury in England. 
792,"EMILIA: And that's Stonehenge, of course. "
793,(Vivien hands round sausage sandwiches.) 
794,ROMANA: Thank you. 
795,"VIVIEN: The gorsedd of Bryn Gwyddon in Wales, and the gorsedd of"
796,Boscombe Moor in Damnonium. 
797,(That's Cornwall as the Romans called it.) 
798,EMILIA: And that's our Nine Travellers. 
799,"ROMANA: Yes, but why should this particular circle become a place of"
800,"prophecy, of augury? You say yourself that there are a dozen or more"
801,stone circles in this part of the country. 
802,EMILIA: If I knew that I'd be professor of megalithic archaeology at
803,"Bangor instead of that fool, Idwal Morgan. "
804,"ROMANA: Er, there is one thing which does strike me as rather curious."
805,"Well, until recently, the land the circle stands on has always been"
806,"owned by a woman. Haven't you noticed? Lady Montcalm, Senora Camara,"
807,"Mrs Trefusis. And if you go further back, right in the Middle Ages, it"
808,came under the control of the Mother Superior of the Convent of the
809,Little Sisters of Saint Gudula. 
810,VIVIEN: What does that prove? Lots of convents and monasteries owned
811,enormous areas of land in the Middle Ages. 
812,"ROMANA: Yes, but here it was women. All women. "
813,"VIVIEN: What are you suggesting, Romana? Some kind of sisterhood that's"
814,"been worshipping these stones for, when was the convent founded?"
815,"Twelfth century, wasn't it? For seven hundred odd years? That's a"
816,"little bit hard to believe, isn't it? "
817,ROMANA: What other explanation is there? 
818,VIVIEN: What about Mister De Vries? He doesn't quite qualify as a head
819,of a sisterhood. 
820,"ROMANA: Well maybe he's not really the head. This convent, does it"
821,still exist? 
822,"EMILIA: Oh, good heavens, no. And it was a man who saw to that, Henry"
823,the Eighth. It went the way of all flesh with the dissolution of the
824,monasteries. 
825,ROMANA: What about the convent records? 
826,"VIVIEN: Oh, I should think they were destroyed. "
827,EMILIA: Some of them could still be at the hall. 
828,ROMANA: The hall? What hall? 
829,EMILIA: Mister De Vries' house. It was built in 1572 on the old site of
830,the convent. 
831,"ROMANA: Well, let's go and take a look. What are we waiting for? "
832,"EMILIA: Oh, good girl! That's the spirit. No time like the present. Get"
833,"my bike, Vivien. "
834,ROMANA: Er. 
835,"VIVIEN: Romana can borrow mine. You won't be needing me with you, will"
836,you? 
837,"EMILIA: No. Keep a good fire burning in case the Doctor comes back. Ah,"
838,here we are. 
839,ROMANA: What's that? 
840,VIVIEN: A policeman's truncheon. Last year when she went to lecture in
841,"New York, she took it with her in case she got mugged. "
842,ROMANA: And did she get mugged? 
843,VIVIEN: No. She got arrested for carrying an offensive weapon. 
844,"EMILIA : Come along, Romana. Tally-ho! "
845, [Entrance hall] 
846, EMILIA: Great Scott! What's happened? Who can have
847,done this? 
848,ROMANA: Doctor? 
849, [Study] 
850, DOCTOR: Shush. 
851,"(He is repairing K9, who is lying on its back with wires hanging out."
852,Great handfuls of shredded paper are taken from his innards.) 
853,"ROMANA: Oh, K9, what have they done to you? "
854,"EMILIA: Oh, poor little fellow. Is he badly hurt? "
855,DOCTOR: I'll know in a moment. 
856,"K9: (feeble) I did my best, master, but it was so strong. "
857,DOCTOR: What was it? 
858,"K9: Silicon based, globulin deficient. "
859,DOCTOR: What? 
860,K9: Too strong. 
861,DOCTOR: Globulin deficient. 
862,ROMANA: Is he all right? 
863,DOCTOR: His entire circuit's nearly all burnt out. 
864,"ROMANA: Yes, but is it repairable? "
865,"K9: Initial damage report suggests not, mistress. Advise"
866,cannibalisation of reusable parts. 
867,"DOCTOR: Oh, nonsense, K9, nonsense. We're not going to turn you into"
868,"scrap yet, are we, Romana? "
869,(They move away from the tin wreck.) 
870,ROMANA: What can we do? 
871,DOCTOR: His only chance is an entire circuit regeneration. How can we
872,do that in time to save him? It might be kinder to remove the cerebral
873,core now. 
874,"ROMANA: Oh no. If we remove the cerebral core, he's finished. "
875,DOCTOR: What can we do? 
876,ROMANA: A molecular stabiliser. 
877,DOCTOR: What? 
878,ROMANA: Is the Tardis fitted with a molecular stabiliser? 
879,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course it was. All Type Forty's were. "
880,ROMANA: I thought so. We had a lecture once at the Academy. If I link
881,up the molecular stabiliser to the circuit frequency modulator 
882,DOCTOR: Brilliant! 
883,ROMANA: You really think so? 
884,"DOCTOR: What? Well, I mean, it's quite ingenious. Anyway, it's worth a"
885,try. 
886,"ROMANA: Anything's worth a try. Look at him, he's on his last legs. "
887,DOCTOR: Right. You get him back to the Tardis and connect him up. I'll
888,stay here with the Professor and look for those bodies. 
889,ROMANA: Right. 
890,(Romana leaves carrying K9.) 
891,EMILIA: Bodies? What bodies? 
892,DOCTOR: De Vries and the woman. They've been killed by that creature.
893,You heard what K9 said. 
894,EMILIA: Creature? 
895,DOCTOR: It's globulin deficient. 
896,EMILIA: Globulin? What's globulin? 
897,DOCTOR: It's a protein found in blood plasma. The creature that kills
898,them lives on blood. 
899, [Stone circle] 
900," (A figure dressed as a bird, with mask and"
901,"feathered robe, carries a bowl of blood in it's claw over to the hollow"
902,in the stone and pours it in. The stone glows and the heartbeat sound
903,begins.) 
904,"CAILLEACH: Ogri, Ogri, you shall do my bidding. Do you hear, Ogri? Do"
905,you hear? 
906, [Study] 
907, (Emilia is going through the books.) 
908,DOCTOR: Anything? 
909,EMILIA: Nothing prior to 1700. You? 
910,DOCTOR: Nothing. I've searched the whole house. Completely empty. No
911,"secret passages, no hidden rooms, nothing. It's got to be here, though."
912,
913,EMILIA: What has? 
914,"DOCTOR: Well, the Cailleach. "
915,"EMILIA: Oh, the witch hag? "
916,DOCTOR: Yes. 
917,EMILIA: It's only a legend. 
918,"DOCTOR: Yes, I know. And so was Troy until dear old Schliemann dug it"
919,"up. Morrigu, Cerridwen, call her what you like. In four thousand years"
920,"I expect she's had quite a few names, but where is she? Hmm? No"
921,"statues, no images, no pictures. Of course! The missing paintings! They"
922,must be here somewhere. 
923,EMILIA: I don't see why the paintings are so important. 
924,DOCTOR: What? Then why have they been hidden? Tell me that. Why have
925,"they been hidden? Beware of the birds, he said. The raven and the crow."
926,The raven and the crow. Birds! 
927,EMILIA: Where? What? 
928,"(The Doctor moves one of the carvings on the stone fire surround, and a"
929,small panel opens in the wall to the left of it.) 
930,DOCTOR: Phew. 
931,"EMILIA: Oh, jumping Joshua. A priest hole. "
932,"DOCTOR: Well, certainly. The place is old enough. Come on! "
933,(The Doctor ducks through the opening.) 
934,"EMILIA: Wait for me, Doctor! "
935,DOCTOR : Now mind these stairs. (bump.) 
936,"(Back at the Tardis, Romana connects K9 to the console with a pair of"
937,"jack plugs in his rear, then leaves. She notices a group of corvids"
938,sitting on the Tardis roof.) 
939, [Cellar] 
940, (Emilia finds the light switch.) 
941,"DOCTOR: Look. Lady Montcalm, painted by Allan Ramsay. "
942,"EMILIA: Good grief, I don't believe it. "
943,"(The Doctor props another picture up on a packing case, and a third on"
944,the floor by it. They all show a dark-haired woman.) 
945,"DOCTOR: Lady Montcalm, Senora Camara, Mrs Trefusis. "
946,(The same dark-haired lady.) 
947,EMILIA: I know that face. 
948,"DOCTOR: So you should. It's your friend, Miss Fay. "
949, [Outside the circle] 
950," (Romana looks over to the stone circle, which is"
951,glowing red. A hand on her shoulder makes her jump.) 
952,"ROMANA: Oh, you scared the life out of me. "
953,VIVIEN: Did I? I'm so sorry. 
954,ROMANA: Look. 
955,"VIVIEN: Oh, is there something going on in the circle? Strange. Let's"
956,"take a look, shall we? "
957, [Stone circle] 
958," ROMANA: Vivien, what are you doing? You're hurting"
959,me. 
960,VIVIEN: Hurry! 
961,"(Vivien throws Romana to the ground, and we see that she is wearing the"
962,bird costume.) 
963,ROMANA: What's going on? 
964,(Vivien takes a long rod and sends energy waves at Romana.) 
965,ROMANA: What are you doing? 
966,(Romana vanishes.) 
967, Part Three
968,
969, [Cellar] 
970, EMILIA: She never told me she was related to the
971,Montcalm family. 
972,"DOCTOR: She isn't. She is the Montcalm family, and the Trefusis family"
973,and the Camara family. And no doubt she's the managing director of the
974,firm that owns the circle now. These three portraits are of the same
975,person. 
976,EMILIA: But look at the dates. There's a hundred and fifty years. 
977,DOCTOR: So? What's a hundred and fifty years when you've been around
978,for more than four thousand? 
979,EMILIA: You mean? 
980,DOCTOR: Yes. She's the Cailleach. 
981,(The Stone has found them.) 
982,DOCTOR: Run. Come on. Quick. 
983,"(The Stone jams itself in the doorway, bringing down some masonry.) "
984, [Outside the Manor House] 
985, EMILIA: I never thought we'd get out of there
986,alive. 
987,"DOCTOR: Come on, we're not clear yet. On you go. "
988,(He shuts the door and they run down the drive. Another Stone is at the
989,gates.) 
990,"DOCTOR: Fascinating, isn't it? "
991,"EMILIA: Doctor, did I understand you correctly? That thing is made of"
992,stone? 
993,"DOCTOR: Yes, and it's closing on us fast. "
994,EMILIA: But it's impossible! 
995,"DOCTOR: No, it isn't. We're standing still. "
996,"EMILIA: I meant a silicon based lifeform is unknown, unheard of,"
997,impossible. 
998,DOCTOR: Maybe it doesn't realise that. 
999,(The Stone crashes through the gates.) 
1000,EMILIA: Doctor? 
1001,"DOCTOR: What is it, what is it? "
1002,"EMILIA: In the cause of science, I think it our duty to capture that"
1003,creature. 
1004,DOCTOR: How? Have you any plans? 
1005,(She takes out her truncheon.) 
1006,EMILIA: We could track it to its lair. 
1007,DOCTOR: Come on! 
1008, [Cliff edge] 
1009, EMILIA: We're trapped! 
1010,(The Stone approaches. The Doctor goes to the edge of the cliff and
1011,takes of his coat. He waves it like a matador's cloak.) 
1012,"EMILIA: I know you're under considerable strain, Doctor, but please"
1013,keep a grip on yourself. 
1014,"(The Stone crashes through some bushes, pauses, then makes a run at the"
1015,"Doctor. With a graceful veronica, the Doctor steps to one side and the"
1016,Stone goes howling down to the jagged rocks below.) 
1017,DOCTOR: Ole! 
1018,(They look over the edge and see the light fade away.) 
1019,"EMILIA: Is it dead, do you suppose? "
1020,"DOCTOR: How do you kill a stone? Let's go and find it's mistress, shall"
1021,we? Come on. 
1022, [Stone circle] 
1023, (Vivien has put her bird mask back on and is using
1024,the long rod to burn a circle in the ground around herself.) 
1025,"DOCTOR: There's no need to wear a mask for our sake, Miss Fay. "
1026,(Vivien takes the mask off.) 
1027,"EMILIA: Vivien, what's going on? He says you're the Cailleach. "
1028,"VIVIEN: I've been so many things, Emilia, for so many years. "
1029,"DOCTOR: Well, it's all over now, Miss Fay. "
1030,"VIVIEN: Oh, not really, Doctor. You see, I've got Romana. "
1031,DOCTOR: Where is she? 
1032,"VIVIEN: Where you'll never be able to find her. Oh, she's perfectly"
1033,"safe. No need to worry, so long as you leave me in peace. "
1034,"DOCTOR: Ah, well, you see, I can't do that, Miss Fay, because you've"
1035,"got something that I need, you see. "
1036,"VIVIEN: I wouldn't come too close if I were you, Doctor. "
1037,"DOCTOR: Oh, absolute nonsense. "
1038,"(The Doctor comes into contact with the protective circle, and falls.) "
1039,DOCTOR: Oh! Static electrical charge. That's a very primitive
1040,forcefield. 
1041,"VIVIEN: It's still very effective. Don't worry about Romana, Doctor. I"
1042,should worry about yourself if I were you. 
1043,DOCTOR: Why? 
1044,"VIVIEN: Count the stones, Doctor. Beware the Ogri. "
1045,(Vivien vanishes.) 
1046,EMILIA: Extraordinary. What did she mean about the stones? 
1047,DOCTOR: Three of the stones are missing. 
1048,EMILIA: Missing? What's happened to them? 
1049,"DOCTOR: One went over the cliff, remember? "
1050,"EMILIA: Oh, you mean that thing was one of the stones? "
1051,DOCTOR: Yes. She called them the Ogri. Ogri. Of course! The Ogri. How
1052,silly of me. 
1053,EMILIA: Ogri? 
1054,"DOCTOR: Yes, from Ogros, their home planet. That's in Tau Ceti."
1055,"Repulsive place covered in great swamps full of amino acids, primitive"
1056,proteins which they feed on by absorption. Hence their need of globulin
1057,
1058,EMILIA: What do you mean? 
1059,"DOCTOR: Which is the nearest equivalent on Earth, hence the blood"
1060,"sacrificed on the stones. Anyway, you know all about the Ogri on Earth."
1061,
1062,EMILIA: Huh? You said there were three of these things. 
1063,DOCTOR: That's right. 
1064,EMILIA: Here. 
1065,"DOCTOR: Gog, Magog, Ogres. They can't be far away. Anyway, you and I"
1066,have got work to do. Listen. Do you by any chance have any tritium
1067,crystals? 
1068,EMILIA: Crystals? 
1069,"DOCTOR: Yes, tritium crystals. Tritium crystals. "
1070,"EMILIA: Oh, but Doctor, what about Vivien? What about Romana? "
1071,"DOCTOR: Professor, listen. You go back to the cottage and see if you"
1072,can find any crystals. I'll go back to my Tardis and see if I can pick
1073,up a few things. 
1074,"EMILIA: Yes, but where have they disappeared to? How are we going to"
1075,find them? 
1076,"DOCTOR: Professor, I don't know. That's why I need the crystals. "
1077, [Vivien's cottage] 
1078, (The Doctor has constructed something weird on a
1079,height adjustable tripod. The middle bit is like a 'what the butler
1080,"saw' machine, a small antenna sticks out at right angles at the front"
1081,and whatever is on his right is covered by a tea towel. Emilia enters
1082,from the kitchen.) 
1083,EMILIA: These are the only crystals I could find apart from a packet of
1084,Epsom salts. 
1085,"(The Doctor samples the contents of the small earthenware jar, then"
1086,listens to it.) 
1087,"DOCTOR: Mmm. Well done, Professor. I knew she must have them somewhere,"
1088,it's the only way she could power that wand of hers. 
1089,(He tips them into the round bit in the middle of his contraption. It
1090,gurgles like an electronic drain. Then he takes off the tea towel to
1091,reveal a purple perspex tube with a saucer and ball fastened onto the
1092,end.) 
1093,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1094,"(The Doctor puts another small antenna on the top of the contraption,"
1095,making the tube the front of it and showing us the control box on the
1096,rear.) 
1097,EMILIA: I still don't understand where Romana and Vivien are. 
1098,DOCTOR: Hyperspace. 
1099,EMILIA: Hyperspace? 
1100,K9: Hyperspace is an extension to the special theory of relativity
1101,propounded by Einstein. Einstein's theory states 
1102,"DOCTOR: Now, now, K9. K9, don't overstrain your databanks. You're not"
1103,fully recovered yet. 
1104,K9: Circuitry regeneration seventy five percent completed. 
1105,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, didn't I give you some calculations to be getting on"
1106,with? 
1107,K9: Calculations cannot be completed until you have finished
1108,constructing the equipment. 
1109,"DOCTOR: All right, all right. Why don't you stop interrupting me and"
1110,let me get on with it then? He's a terrible old gasbag. 
1111,EMILIA: I still don't understand about hyperspace. 
1112,"DOCTOR: Well, who does? "
1113,K9: I do. 
1114,"DOCTOR: Oh, shut up, K9. It's all to do with interspatial geometry. "
1115,"EMILIA: Oh, I never studied that. "
1116,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm not surprised. They gave up teaching it two thousand"
1117,"years ago, even on Gallifrey. "
1118,"EMILIA: Oh, I beg your pardon? "
1119,"DOCTOR: Here. Look, how can I explain? Listen, Einstein's Special"
1120,Theory of Relativity said 
1121,EMILIA: Said that you cannot travel in space faster than the speed of
1122,"light, because the speed of light is a limiting factor. If you"
1123,"travelled more than a hundred and eighty thousand miles per second,"
1124,you'd encounter the time distortion effect. 
1125,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, well, he was nearly right. "
1126,"EMILIA: In fact, you'd arrive at your destination before you'd left"
1127,your starting point. 
1128,"DOCTOR: Yes. Absurd, isn't it? "
1129,"EMILIA: Oh, I don't know. "
1130,"DOCTOR: I always thought it was fun, myself. I did try to explain the"
1131,"realities to poor old Albert, but he would insist that he knew best. "
1132,"EMILIA: Oh, they're all the same, these physicists. Oh, sorry. "
1133,"DOCTOR: No, that's all right. I mean, apart from space warping, which"
1134,"he couldn't possibly understand, there is a theoretical way of avoiding"
1135,the time distort. 
1136,EMILIA: Is there really? 
1137,"DOCTOR: Yes. Just pass me that screwdriver, will you? Yes, you operate"
1138,"in a different dimension, you see, in another kind of space. "
1139,"EMILIA: Otherwise, hyperspace. "
1140,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1141,EMILIA: But I still don't know where Romana and Vivien are. 
1142,"DOCTOR: Listen. They're still in the circle, or whatever occupies that"
1143,space in the other dimension. 
1144,"EMILIA: Oh, I see. "
1145,DOCTOR: Good. Perhaps you'll explain it to me sometime when you've got
1146,a few minutes to spare. 
1147,EMILIA: Doctor? 
1148,DOCTOR: Yes? 
1149,EMILIA: May I ask you a personal question? 
1150,"DOCTOR: Well, I don't see how I can stop you asking. "
1151,EMILIA: Are you from outer space? 
1152,DOCTOR: No. 
1153,EMILIA: Oh. 
1154,DOCTOR: I'm more from what you'd call inner time. 
1155,EMILIA: Ah. 
1156,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, never mind about that now. K9, what do you think of"
1157,this? Hmm? Well? 
1158,K9: The theory appears to be ingenious. 
1159,"DOCTOR: Yes, but will it work? "
1160,K9: Affirmative. It will be effective on a setting of point naught
1161,naught three seven on the hyperspace scale. 
1162,"DOCTOR: What, only on that end of the scale? "
1163,"K9: Affirmative, master. "
1164,DOCTOR: That means it'll burn out the circuits in about ten and a half
1165,seconds flat. 
1166,"K9: Correction, master. Circuits will burn out after thirty one point"
1167,two seven seconds. 
1168,DOCTOR: Thirty one point two seven. Is that long enough to get me into
1169,hyperspace? 
1170,"K9: Insufficient data, master. Answer depends upon where in hyperspace"
1171,and what is there when you arrive. 
1172,"DOCTOR: Thank you very much, K9. "
1173,"K9: Actual area of transportation beam will be small. It is imperative,"
1174,"therefore, that you mark your point of entry on arrival in order to"
1175,facilitate finding it again for return. 
1176,"DOCTOR: Good point, K9. Thank you. Come on, Emilia. I need your help."
1177,"K9, let's go see if this works. "
1178, [Stone circle] 
1179," DOCTOR: Now, you understand what you've got to do?"
1180,
1181,"EMILIA: I think so. Switch on, and then wait until the needle points on"
1182,"the dial to oh oh three seven, then throw that lever. "
1183,"DOCTOR: Right. Now remember, you've only got thirty seconds and then"
1184,pow! 
1185,EMILIA: Pow? 
1186,"DOCTOR: Yes. Pow. Pow. Pow is a technical expression, Professor. It"
1187,means that all the microcircuitry will fuse into one great urgh of
1188,molten metal. 
1189,"EMILIA: Yes, but what happens if the Ogri come back while you're"
1190,wherever you'll be? 
1191,"DOCTOR: Ah, well that's where K9 comes in. You see, he'll generate a"
1192,"forcefield a touch more sophisticated than Miss Fay's, and that should"
1193,keep them out for a while. 
1194,EMILIA: For how long? 
1195,"K9: My power packs will be drained in approximately seventeen minutes,"
1196,thirty one point eight six seconds. 
1197,"DOCTOR: There you are. Now, if they should break through, run as if"
1198,"something very nasty were after you, because something very nasty will"
1199,be after you. 
1200,"EMILIA: Yeah, but what about you? "
1201,DOCTOR: Don't worry about me. I'll be doing plenty of that in any case.
1202,
1203,"EMILIA: Yes, but how will you get back? "
1204,"DOCTOR: You just switch on for thirty seconds, say, every half hour. "
1205,EMILIA: If you think that'll work. 
1206,"DOCTOR: Well, of course it'll work and even if it doesn't work, what"
1207,does it matter? You know what they say about hyperspace. 
1208,EMILIA: No. 
1209,"DOCTOR: They say it's a theoretical absurdity, and that's something"
1210,I've always wanted to be lost in. Ready? Now switch on. 
1211,"EMILIA: Er, oh oh two two, oh oh three three, oh oh three seven "
1212,DOCTOR: Now! 
1213,(Flash bang!) 
1214,DOCTOR: Switch off! Switch off! 
1215,"EMILIA: Oh, did I do something wrong? "
1216,K9: There is an error in the circuitry. You are not to blame. 
1217,"DOCTOR: All right, all right, all right. We're not all programmed for"
1218,"perfection, you know. Ah, there's the fault. "
1219,K9: Danger. Ogri approaching from south-southwest. 
1220,EMILIA: I can't see. 
1221,K9: Two Ogri approaching from south-southwest. 
1222,"DOCTOR: Nearly finished. There, that should do it. Let's hope it works"
1223,this time. 
1224,K9: Ogri fifty metres and closing. 
1225,"DOCTOR: Now remember, do exactly as you did last time. "
1226,EMILIA: Ready? 
1227,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1228,K9: Ogri forty metres and closing. 
1229,EMILIA: Oh oh three seven. Holding. 
1230,K9: Ogri twenty eight metres and closing. 
1231,DOCTOR: Now! 
1232,(The Doctor vanishes.) 
1233,EMILIA: K9! 
1234,(K9 shoots at an Ogri.) 
1235, [Spaceship entry point] 
1236," (The Doctor appears in a lovely white spaceship,"
1237,spinning like a top.) 
1238,DOCTOR: Romana? Romana? 
1239,(He chalks a X on the floor grill and goes along a short corridor then
1240,"down a couple of steps into a room with a control console, where he"
1241,looks out of the window. A silver skinned figures watches him. Romana
1242,"is manacled to a wall somewhere, next to a robot wearing leggings. The"
1243,Doctor goes along another corridor to an area with doors off it. He
1244,"looks through the small triangle windows in the doors, opens one and a"
1245,mummified corpse falls out. He puts it back and goes to another and
1246,opens it.) 
1247, [Cell] 
1248, DOCTOR: All change at Venus for the Brighton line.
1249,
1250,ROMANA: Very funny. Where have you been? What's happening? Where am I? 
1251,"DOCTOR: Well, in strict order of asking, busy, nothing, hyperspace."
1252,Your friend doesn't look too well. What happened to you? 
1253,"ROMANA: Well, I don't know, exactly. All I remember is Vivien Fay"
1254,coming up behind me then waking up here. 
1255,(The Doctor undoes her manacles with his sonic screwdriver.) 
1256,"ROMANA: What do you mean, hyperspace? It can't be. "
1257,DOCTOR: Why not? 
1258,"ROMANA: Well, hyperspace is a theoretical absurdity. Everybody knows"
1259,that. 
1260,"DOCTOR: Yes, except, apparently, the people who built this ship four"
1261,thousand years ago. It's a hyperspace vessel. 
1262,ROMANA: That's ridiculous. 
1263,DOCTOR: Come on. 
1264, [Spaceship] 
1265," ROMANA: Even granting the hyperspace hypothesis,"
1266,"Doctor, what about deceleration? How do you decelerate an infinite"
1267,"mass? Anyway, where is this ship? Why can't it be seen from Earth? "
1268,"(They return to the junction room, where the Doctor uses a small"
1269,control panel.) 
1270,DOCTOR: There's your answer. 
1271,(A diagram comes up on a screen.) 
1272,ROMANA: That's only few feet from the circle. Why can't it be seen? 
1273,DOCTOR: Because it exists in a different kind of space from the circle.
1274,
1275,"ROMANA: In hyperspace, not in ordinary four dimensional space. "
1276,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1277,"ROMANA: Well, why has it stopped here? "
1278,DOCTOR: Maybe it ran out of fuel. 
1279,ROMANA: Are you sure this thing's been here for four thousand years? 
1280,DOCTOR: Why? 
1281,"ROMANA: Well, look at the cabin and the controls. They're like new. "
1282,DOCTOR: Perhaps someone's been spring cleaning. 
1283,ROMANA: Vivien Fay? 
1284,"DOCTOR: Yeah. Romana. Romana, there's plenty of fuel. The drive unit's"
1285,still working. 
1286,"ROMANA: Well, maybe it ran aground. "
1287,DOCTOR: On what? 
1288,ROMANA: Who knows what's in hyperspace. 
1289,DOCTOR: Yes. We'd better search the ship. The third segment must be
1290,"here somewhere, to say nothing of our friend Miss Fay. "
1291,"ROMANA: Well, where do we start? It looks rather big, don't you think? "
1292, [Stone circle] 
1293, K9: Power depleted. Cannot hold much longer. 
1294,(Emilia is timing the use of the hyperspace window machine.) 
1295,EMILIA: Where's that Dunkirk spirit? Never say die. 
1296,"K9: I never do say die, but I cannot hold. "
1297,EMILIA: Nothing. There's no one there. 
1298,(She switches off the machine. K9 stops firing at the Ogri.) 
1299,"EMILIA: K9? Are you all right, K9? Oh, what's happening? Look at the"
1300,Ogri. They're going. They're giving up. 
1301,K9: Assumption incorrect. They are going. That is not to say they are
1302,giving up. 
1303,"EMILIA: Oh, I thought you were. Are you all right, K9? "
1304,K9: Power exhausted. 
1305,EMILIA: Can you recharge yourself? 
1306,"K9: Affirmative, given time. "
1307,EMILIA: Do you think they'll come back? 
1308,K9: Affirmative. Suspect they have gone away to recharge. 
1309,EMILIA: Recharge? But how? 
1310,K9: With globulin. 
1311,"EMILIA: Oh, that means finding more blood. "
1312,K9: Affirmative. 
1313,EMILIA: It means they're going to kill somebody. 
1314, [Field] 
1315, (A young man crawls out of his tent to discover
1316,two standing stones have appeared just feet away. He goes to
1317,investigate.) 
1318,"MAN: Hey, Pat. Pat! "
1319,PAT: What's up? 
1320,MAN: Come and have a look at this. You won't believe it. 
1321,PAT: What is it? Where did they come from? 
1322,MAN: Don't know. They weren't here last night. 
1323,PAT: Perhaps it's a joke. Perhaps someone from the Wheatsheaf dumped
1324,them here during the night. 
1325,MAN: How? They must weigh tons. 
1326,"PAT: I suppose they are real rock, not just fakes. "
1327,(She goes over and touches one. It's heartbeat starts up and she can't
1328,remove her hand.) 
1329,MAN: What's the matter? 
1330,PAT: My hand! My hand! I 
1331,"(He takes hold of her, the stone glows brighter and they both start"
1332,screaming. Pat's hand turns to bone before we fade out to a screen of
1333,blood red.) 
1334, [Outside the cells] 
1335, ROMANA: Do you think there could be anything alive
1336,in any of these? 
1337,"DOCTOR: What, after four thousand years? I shouldn't think so. Mind"
1338,"you, I'll tell you something. If there is anything still alive, it'll"
1339,be furious at all the delay. Oh! 
1340,ROMANA: What? (One of the cells contains a Wirrn.) 
1341,"DOCTOR: You know, I think this must have been a convict ship. "
1342,"ROMANA: Look, the seal on that door's a different colour from the rest."
1343,
1344,DOCTOR: First class in hyperspace? 
1345,ROMANA: What does it say? 
1346,"DOCTOR: I don't know. I can't read the script. Probably just says, do"
1347,"not open, penalty fifty pounds. "
1348,ROMANA: Anything there? 
1349,DOCTOR: Can't see. 
1350,"ROMANA: Well, what shall we do? "
1351,DOCTOR: Open it. 
1352,ROMANA: Right. 
1353,(The Doctor breaks the seal and pulls the handle. As they duck down to
1354,"look inside, two sparkly somethings float out above their heads.) "
1355,ROMANA: What's that? 
1356,DOCTOR: I don't know. 
1357,MEGARA: It is not permitted to touch the Megara. 
1358,DOCTOR: I beg your pardon. I beg your pardon. What's the Megara? 
1359,ROMANA: I don't know. 
1360,MEGARA: We are the Megara. We are justice machines. 
1361,ROMANA: Justice machines? 
1362,MEGARA: We are the law. 
1363,"MEGARA 2: Judge, jury and executioner. "
1364,MEGARA: Once we have arrived at our verdict 
1365,MEGARA 2: We execute it 
1366,MEGARA: Without fear or favour 
1367,MEGARA 2: Impartially. 
1368,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a great relief to know that the law is in such"
1369,capable hands. We have to be going now. 
1370,ROMANA: What's the matter? 
1371,"DOCTOR: Never mind, just keep moving. "
1372,MEGARA: Stop. Turn around. Do not move. 
1373,MEGARA 2: Which of you removed the Great Seals? 
1374,DOCTOR: I did. I feared for your safety. 
1375,MEGARA: He meant well. 
1376,MEGARA 2: But the law clearly states that no one may remove the seals
1377,without authorisation. The penalty is death. 
1378,MEGARA: Where is your authorisation? 
1379,"DOCTOR: I'm sorry, I didn't realise I needed authorisation. You see,"
1380,I'm a stranger here myself. But I promise I'll never break any other
1381,seals without authorisation ever. 
1382,MEGARA: Contrition is to be accounted in the accused favour. 
1383,MEGARA 2: Ignorance of the law is not. 
1384,MEGARA: I will undertake his defence. 
1385,(The Doctor and Romana sneak away.) 
1386,MEGARA 2: I think you should advise your client that there is little
1387,likelihood of clemency. 
1388,MEGARA: I will so advise him. He has gone! 
1389,MEGARA 2: Further proof of guilt. 
1390,MEGARA: No matter. None can escape the Megara. 
1391, [Stone circle] 
1392, EMILIA: I can't see those creatures anywhere. Are
1393,you recharged yet? 
1394,K9: Negative. Recharging incomplete. It is time to switch on the beam
1395,again. 
1396,"EMILIA: Oh yes, you're right. Oh well, anyway, we haven't got those"
1397,creatures breathing down our necks. Here goes. 
1398,(The silver woman appears.) 
1399,EMILIA: Vivien! 
1400,"K9: Do not touch that machine, Miss Fay, otherwise I will be forced to"
1401,stun you. 
1402,"VIVIEN: Ha, you haven't enough power left in you to strike a match. See"
1403,what I mean? 
1404,EMILIA: Vivien 
1405,"VIVIEN: No, Emilia, don't make me kill you. "
1406,"EMILIA: No, they can't get back if you "
1407,(Vivien blasts the machine with her rod.) 
1408,"VIVIEN : Ogri, come. I command you. "
1409,(She vanishes.) 
1410, [Spaceship entry point] 
1411," ROMANA: Doctor, they're still following us. "
1412,DOCTOR: What do you expect? They're justice machines. Come on. X marks
1413,the spot. 
1414,ROMANA: What? 
1415,DOCTOR: The projector Professor Rumford's using has got a very small
1416,"spread. If we're not in exactly the right place when she switches on,"
1417,"we'll never get back. Come on, Professor. "
1418,"ROMANA: Nothing. Doctor, behind us. Look! "
1419,(Vivien and the Ogri appear in the control room.) 
1420,"VIVIEN: Too late now, Doctor. I've destroyed your pitiful little"
1421,machine. There's no way out for you. You're trapped in hyperspace
1422,forever. Bwahahahahahahaha! 
1423, Part Four
1424,
1425, [Spaceship entry point] 
1426," VIVIEN: Ogri, come. "
1427,(The Stones arrive.) 
1428,MEGARA: Do not harm our prisoner. 
1429,"VIVIEN: Ogri, stop. The Megara. "
1430,DOCTOR: Mmm. Are they friends of yours? 
1431, [Spaceship] 
1432, (The Doctor goes along the little corridor and
1433,down into the control room.) 
1434,VIVIEN: Did you break the seals? 
1435,"DOCTOR: Well, yes, I'm afraid I did. "
1436,"MEGARA: Silence. He is ours. He is ours. Afterwards, you may have him. "
1437,"DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, please, don't rush on my account. I'm so sorry to"
1438,disappoint you. 
1439,MEGARA 2: The prisoner has been tried and sentenced in his absence. The
1440,sentence will now be carried out. 
1441,DOCTOR: What sentence? 
1442,MEGARA 2: The sentence is death. You are to be executed immediately. 
1443,"VIVIEN: Oh, may I watch? You don't mind, do you, Doctor? "
1444,"DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. Please, be my guest. I wouldn't want you to"
1445,miss my execution. 
1446,MEGARA 2: Prepare for dissolution. 
1447,DOCTOR: Objection! 
1448,MEGARA 2: On what grounds? 
1449,DOCTOR: How can there possibly be a sentence when there hasn't been a
1450,trial. 
1451,MEGARA 2: There has been a trial. 
1452,DOCTOR: There has been a trial. There has? 
1453,MEGARA: I defended you. 
1454,MEGARA 2: I was judge. You were found guilty. 
1455,DOCTOR: But I wasn't there. 
1456,MEGARA 2: Immaterial. Your counsel was. He was most eloquent on your
1457,behalf. 
1458,DOCTOR: I demand the right to defend myself. 
1459,MEGARA 2: Not permitted. 
1460,DOCTOR: Why not? 
1461,MEGARA: You are a humanoid and therefore quite incapable of
1462,appreciating the subtleties of the law. 
1463,DOCTOR: Machine law. 
1464,MEGARA 2: But of course. There is no other law. 
1465,DOCTOR: Ah. I see. Just a minute. 
1466,"MEGARA: As your counsel, my advice to you is to submit to execution. So"
1467,much easier in the end. 
1468,DOCTOR: I wish to appeal against my sentence. 
1469,MEGARA 2: There are no grounds. 
1470,DOCTOR: How do you know? You haven't heard my case yet. 
1471,(The Megara confer in electronic beeps.) 
1472,"VIVIEN: Your Honours, surely you're not going to allow yourselves to be"
1473,persuaded by this criminal? 
1474,MEGARA 2: Who are you? Identify yourself to the court. 
1475,VIVIEN: Vivien Fay. 
1476,ROMANA: She's the reason why we're here. 
1477,MEGARA 2: Are you saying that Vivien Fay broke the seals? 
1478,"ROMANA: No, but what I'm saying "
1479,MEGARA 2: Then your evidence is immaterial. 
1480,MEGARA: And incompetent. 
1481,MEGARA 2: Attempts to influence the bench are punishable by death. 
1482,"MEGARA: Article twenty three of the legal code, subsection seventeen. "
1483,"DOCTOR: Ahem. Could we get back to my appeal, please? "
1484,"MEGARA 2: In accordance with article fourteen of the legal code,"
1485,"subsection one three five, this humanoid's execution is stayed for two"
1486,"hours while we graciously consent to hear his appeal. Afterwards, the"
1487,execution will take place as ordered. 
1488,DOCTOR: Your Honours are too kind. 
1489,VIVIEN: I demand that you execute him now. 
1490,MEGARA 2: You are out of order. 
1491,DOCTOR: Ha! 
1492, [Stone circle] 
1493," (It is daylight, and K9 lifts his weary head.) "
1494,"EMILIA: Oh, thank heavens. Are you better, dear? "
1495,"K9: Thank you, Professor Rumford. "
1496,EMILIA: Can you move? 
1497,"K9: Mobility impaired, but databanks recharged. "
1498,EMILIA: What are we going to do? Vivien smashed the machine. 
1499,"K9: Reconstruct it. With your help, it shouldn't be difficult. "
1500,"EMILIA: With my help? I'm an archaeologist, not an engineer. "
1501,K9: You will work under my direction. 
1502,EMILIA: Oh. 
1503, [Spaceship] 
1504, ROMANA: You must tell the Megara we're Time Lords.
1505,
1506,DOCTOR: I just don't 
1507,ROMANA: Tell them! 
1508,"DOCTOR: I don't think, I don't think it would do any good. They're"
1509,"justice machines, remember? I knew a Galactic Federation once, lots of"
1510,different lifeforms so they appointed a justice machine to administer
1511,the law. 
1512,ROMANA: What happened? 
1513,DOCTOR: They found the Federation in contempt of court and blew up the
1514,entire galaxy. 
1515,"MEGARA 2: The court has considered the request of the humanoid,"
1516,hereinafter known as the Doctor. In order to speed up the process of
1517,"law, it will graciously permit him to conduct his own appeal, prior to"
1518,his execution. 
1519,"DOCTOR: Thank you, Your Honour. "
1520,MEGARA 2: You may call your first witness. 
1521,"DOCTOR: I call as my first witness, Miss Romanadvoratrelundar. "
1522,ROMANA: Me? 
1523,DOCTOR: Hmm. 
1524,ROMANA: But I'm not a witness. 
1525,(The Doctor takes a barrister's wig out of his pocket and puts it on
1526,his head.) 
1527,MEGARA 2: The witness will take the stand and be sworn in. The witness
1528,will repeat the oath. I swear to tell the truth. Repeat. 
1529,ROMANA: I swear to tell the truth. 
1530,"MEGARA 2: As far as I, a mere humanoid "
1531,"ROMANA: As far as I. Look, I object to the wording. "
1532,MEGARA 2: Contempt is punishable by death. 
1533,(The Doctor is leafing through some legal briefs he's acquired from
1534,somewhere.) 
1535,"DOCTOR: Your Honours, I'm sure that my witness wishes to withdraw that"
1536,"last remark, don't you. "
1537,MEGARA 2: Do you? 
1538,"ROMANA: As far as I, a mere humanoid "
1539,MEGARA 2: Am capable of knowing the truth. 
1540,ROMANA: Am capable of knowing the truth. 
1541,(A faint beam lines up with Romana's forehead.) 
1542,ROMANA: What's that? 
1543,MEGARA: It assesses the level of truth. 
1544,ROMANA: Oh. What happens if the level falls? 
1545,"MEGARA: That would be most regrettable, Miss Romanadvoratrelundar. "
1546,"DOCTOR: Miss Dvoratrelundar, when we opened the hyperspace capsules,"
1547,what did we find inside? 
1548,ROMANA: Dead things. 
1549,DOCTOR: Dead things? 
1550,"ROMANA: Well, bodies of dead creatures. Dead travellers, I suppose. "
1551,DOCTOR: And when we found the hyperspace capsule in which their Honours
1552,"were travelling, could you see what was inside? "
1553,ROMANA: No. 
1554,DOCTOR: What did you think was inside? 
1555,ROMANA: I didn't know. It could have been anything. 
1556,"DOCTOR: What, even creatures still alive? "
1557,ROMANA: Yes. 
1558,DOCTOR: No further questions. 
1559,MEGARA 2: The witness is excused. 
1560, [Vivien's cottage] 
1561, (Emilia is repairing the hyperspace window
1562,generator.) 
1563,"EMILIA: How's that, K9? "
1564,K9: You have now linked the alpha circuit to the sine interphase. 
1565,EMILIA: I have? Is that all right? 
1566,K9: Affirmative. 
1567,"EMILIA: Oh, it's not so difficult after all. "
1568,K9: Continue. 
1569, [Spaceship] 
1570," DOCTOR: Your Honours, I call as my second witness"
1571,Miss Vivien Fay. 
1572,VIVIEN: But I'm not a witness. 
1573,DOCTOR: That's for their Honours to decide. I call Miss Fay. 
1574,VIVIEN: But I'm not a witness. I didn't see anything. I don't know
1575,anything. 
1576,DOCTOR: I call Miss Fay. 
1577,VIVIEN: No! 
1578,"MEGARA 2: Once you have been called, you must appear. It is the law. "
1579,DOCTOR: Ha! Ha! 
1580,"VIVIEN: But I know nothing, your Honour "
1581,MEGARA 2: It is the law. 
1582,VIVIEN: Ogri. 
1583,(The two Stones appear at the entrance to the room. The Megara turn one
1584,of them to dust. Vivien is horrified.) 
1585,ROMANA: I see what you mean about the galaxy. 
1586,VIVIEN: I will take the oath. 
1587,"ROMANA: What are you up to, Doctor? "
1588,DOCTOR: Trying to find out who she really is. 
1589,ROMANA: Is that important? 
1590,"DOCTOR: Well, it might just save my life. "
1591,MEGARA 2: Repeat. 
1592,ROMANA: What do you mean? 
1593,DOCTOR: Why else do you think the Megara are here? 
1594,VIVIEN: I swear. 
1595,ROMANA: You mean they're after Miss Fay? 
1596,"DOCTOR: Well, who else has been around for four thousand years? It's"
1597,got to be Miss Fay. 
1598,ROMANA: Why don't they just arrest her? 
1599,"DOCTOR: Because they're justices, not policemen. "
1600,ROMANA: Ah. I suppose those poor creatures back there were the police. 
1601,DOCTOR: Yes. It's a pity they're also dead. 
1602,"ROMANA: Well, if this is a police vessel, then surely they must have a"
1603,"description of her. An identification, voice print "
1604,DOCTOR: Shush. All the Megara will have is a name on the charge sheet. 
1605,ROMANA: There must be something incriminating in her cottage. I'll try
1606,and get back somehow. 
1607,DOCTOR: Good girl. 
1608,ROMANA: Can you keep it going here? 
1609,"DOCTOR: Yes, but not for long. "
1610,"MEGARA: Doctor, we are waiting. "
1611,"DOCTOR: I beg your pardon, your Honours. I was consulting with my"
1612,associate. 
1613,(Romana leaves.) 
1614,VIVIEN: Where's that girl going? She has no right leaving the court
1615,without the judge's permission. 
1616,(An Ogri follows Romana.) 
1617,"DOCTOR: Oh come, what does it matter where she goes. As we all know, no"
1618,"one can escape the Megara. Am I not right, your Honour? "
1619,"MEGARA 2: Proceed with the questioning, Doctor. Your execution is long"
1620,overdue. 
1621,"DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. I request that this witness be attached to the"
1622,truth assessor. 
1623,MEGARA: Unnecessary. 
1624,DOCTOR: What? But why? The previous witness was attached to the
1625,assessor. 
1626,MEGARA: Because she was present when the seals to our compartment was
1627,broken. This witness was not. 
1628,DOCTOR: I demand that this witness be treated in exactly the same way
1629,as the previous one. 
1630,MEGARA 2: Demand? 
1631,"DOCTOR: Request, then. "
1632,"MEGARA 2: Request denied. Proceed, Doctor. "
1633,(Vivien laughs.) 
1634, [Spaceship entry point] 
1635, ROMANA: If only Vivien Fay hadn't broken that
1636,machine. 
1637, [Stone circle] 
1638, (The hyperspace window generator is back in
1639,position.) 
1640,EMILIA: Perhaps I ought to check the wiring. I may have joined
1641,something up wrong. 
1642,K9: I was superintending the work. 
1643,EMILIA: Just the same. 
1644,(Both Romana and the Ogri appear.) 
1645,"K9: Danger, danger. "
1646,"ROMANA: Run, Professor, run. "
1647,(Emilia picks up the device and they flee.) 
1648, [Spaceship] 
1649, DOCTOR: I submit most respectfully that your
1650,Honours are in error. 
1651,MEGARA 2: Error? Impossible. 
1652,MEGARA: We are programmed against the possibility of error. 
1653,DOCTOR: But you have ruled that this witness need not be attached to
1654,the assessor because she wasn't present when the seals of your capsule
1655,were broken. 
1656,MEGARA: Correct. 
1657,DOCTOR: How do you know that? 
1658,MEGARA: Because we did not see her when we emerged. 
1659,DOCTOR: That is not proof. 
1660,MEGARA: Do you now say she was there? 
1661,"DOCTOR: No, no, I don't say that. I say that she will never tell us"
1662,anything approaching the truth unless she is forced to. I don't think
1663,"that she'd even tell us her real name, except from fear of the"
1664,assessor. 
1665,"VIVIEN: Your Honours, may a mere humanoid offer a suggestion? "
1666,MEGARA 2: If you must. 
1667,"VIVIEN: If it will facilitate the proceedings, may I say that I have no"
1668,objection to the assessor. Attach me to it if you wish. Ask me if I
1669,broke the seals. I will answer truthfully. 
1670, [Vivien's cottage] 
1671," ROMANA: K9, stay on guard. Now, Professor, you"
1672,stayed here. You spent a lot of time in her company. Is there any part
1673,of the house where she didn't like you to go? Anywhere or anything she
1674,kept locked? 
1675, [Spaceship] 
1676, (Vivien is attached to the assessor.) 
1677,"MEGARA 2: Are you ready, Miss Fay? "
1678,"VIVIEN: Ready, your Honours. "
1679,"MEGARA 2: You will answer my questions truthfully. Should you lie, the"
1680,assessor will register the degree of untruth and react accordingly. You
1681,understand? 
1682,"VIVIEN: I understand, your Honours. "
1683,"MEGARA 2: The question is, did you or did you not remove the seals from"
1684,the official compartment in which my colleague and I were travelling? 
1685,VIVIEN: I did not. 
1686,MEGARA: A reading of zero point six on the scale is registered. 
1687,DOCTOR: What does that mean? 
1688,MEGARA 2: An answer within the legal definition of truth. 
1689,DOCTOR: Are you sure? 
1690,MEGARA: We do not make mistakes. 
1691,DOCTOR: How do you know? You've been locked in that capsule for four
1692,thousand years! Even the finest piece of machinery deteriorates after
1693,"that time. Rust, dust, pieces of fluff. Think how you'd feel if you"
1694,condemn an innocent humanoid to death just because you got a bit of
1695,fluff stuck in your sprocket wheel or whatever it is you've got in
1696,there. 
1697,MEGARA: Living cells. A microcellular metallic organism. 
1698,MEGARA 2: We are bio-machines. 
1699,MEGARA: Incapable of error. 
1700,"DOCTOR: Very well. If you're so perfect, test yourselves, I dare you."
1701,Ask her her real name. 
1702,MEGARA 2: Irrelevant. 
1703,MEGARA: Irrational. 
1704,"MEGARA 2: You broke the seals without proper authorisation, the penalty"
1705,for which offence is execution. 
1706,DOCTOR: I thought you were on my side. 
1707,MEGARA: I am. You are my client. 
1708,DOCTOR: Great lawyer you've turned out to be. 
1709,MEGARA: I have your interests at heart. I do not wish you to suffer
1710,"unduly. I will plead with my colleague for a swift, painless death for"
1711,you. 
1712,(An electronic consultation.) 
1713,MEGARA 2: Your plea is granted. 
1714,"MEGARA: You see, Doctor? Justice can be merciful. You may step down,"
1715,Miss Fay. 
1716,"VIVIEN: Thank you, your Honours. "
1717,MEGARA: Proceed with the execution immediately. 
1718,DOCTOR: Objection! 
1719,MEGARA 2: To what are you objecting this time? 
1720,DOCTOR: I haven't finished presenting my case yet. I have another
1721,witness I wish to call. 
1722,MEGARA: But there are no other witnesses here. 
1723,"DOCTOR: You're wrong, your Honour. There's one other witness I can"
1724,call. 
1725,MEGARA: Who? 
1726,DOCTOR: You. 
1727, [Vivien's cottage] 
1728," EMILIA: Oh, it's hopeless. We don't even know what"
1729,we're looking for. Perhaps we've seen it without realising it. Perhaps
1730,"it's at the hall. Found anything, K9? "
1731,"K9: Negative, Professor. "
1732,ROMANA : Citric acid! 
1733,EMILIA: What? 
1734, [Kitchen] 
1735, ROMANA: Lemon juice. 
1736,EMILIA: I know what citric acid is. 
1737,"ROMANA: Look at these cookery books. Some of the recipes are marked,"
1738,and some are crossed out. 
1739,"EMILIA: Well, she crossed out things she didn't like. "
1740,ROMANA: Like recipes containing citric acid. 
1741,EMILIA: She was allergic to lemon juice. 
1742,ROMANA: She said that? 
1743,EMILIA: Yes. She wouldn't touch lemon tea or lager and lime 
1744,ROMANA: Anything else? 
1745,"EMILIA: Er, grapefruit, oranges "
1746, [Vivien's cottage] 
1747," EMILIA: Avocados, certain kinds of meat. Don't see"
1748,what you're getting at. 
1749,"ROMANA: Have you ever wondered why the Ogri don't attack her? I mean,"
1750,why should she be safe? 
1751,EMILIA: Perhaps they don't fancy her blood. 
1752,ROMANA: Precisely. Which means that Vivien Fay has a different
1753,"metabolism to Earth-born humans. K9, with a metabolism like that, what"
1754,kind of planet does she come from? 
1755,"K9: Referring to memory banks, mistress. "
1756,"ROMANA: Think, Professor, think. Any little thing could give us a clue."
1757,Is there anything you can remember? 
1758, [Spaceship] 
1759, (The Doctor is pacing.) 
1760,MEGARA: We are justice machines. 
1761,MEGARA 2: Judge. 
1762,MEGARA: Jury. 
1763,MEGARA 2: Executioner. 
1764,MEGARA: We cannot be called to give evidence. 
1765,DOCTOR: Why not? Why not? I only want to put my counsel on the stand.
1766,"There's nothing in the law that says I can't do that, is there? Well,"
1767,is there? 
1768,"MEGARA 2: According to our databanks, the law does not actually specify"
1769,that the accused may not call his own counsel. 
1770,"DOCTOR: Very well, I call the Megara! "
1771,MEGARA 2: But it is most unorthodox indeed. It may be grounds for a
1772,charge of contempt of court. 
1773,(The Megara confer.) 
1774,"DOCTOR: I shall of course, your Honour, dispense with the oath. "
1775,MEGARA 2: You certainly will. The Megara cannot lie. 
1776,"DOCTOR: Well, that's handy. Why were you sealed in your capsule? "
1777,MEGARA: Because we are justice machines travelling on judicial
1778,business. 
1779,DOCTOR: Travelling to where? 
1780,"MEGARA: Diplos, a G class planet in Tau Ceti. "
1781,DOCTOR: What was the nature of your business? 
1782,MEGARA: To try a humanoid criminal. 
1783,DOCTOR: Ah. A female humanoid criminal? 
1784, [Vivien's cottage] 
1785, ROMANA: It has to be a G class planet in Tau Ceti.
1786,
1787,"K9: There are two other possibilities, mistress. "
1788,ROMANA: Both incapable of supporting any form of humanoid life.
1789,"Besides, the planet Ogros, the home of the Ogri, is in the same star"
1790,system. 
1791,(Something starts rattling the china in the dresser.) 
1792,"EMILIA: Talking of the Ogri, what happened to our friend? "
1793,K9: Ogri approaching. 
1794,"ROMANA: How close, K9? "
1795,(Outside the window.) 
1796,"ROMANA: Come on, let's get out of here! "
1797,(The Ogri smashes down the front door.) 
1798, [Spaceship] 
1799, DOCTOR: Of what crime had the female humanoid been
1800,accused? 
1801,"MEGARA: Murder, and the removal and misuse of the Great Seal of Diplos."
1802,
1803,"DOCTOR: Ah. And did the Great Seal of Diplos, by any chance, have any"
1804,special powers? 
1805,"MEGARA: It has the powers of transmutation, transformation and the"
1806,establishing of hyperspatial and temporal coordinates. 
1807,DOCTOR: Ha. Exactly as I thought. 
1808,MEGARA 2: Is this relevant? 
1809,"DOCTOR: Well it is to me, your Honour, yes. What is this female"
1810,humanoid called? 
1811,MEGARA: She is known as Cessair of Diplos. 
1812,DOCTOR: And her description? 
1813,MEGARA: We have none. 
1814,"DOCTOR: You have none. How do you expect to identify her, then? "
1815,MEGARA: We do not. 
1816,DOCTOR: You do not. 
1817,(Vivien laughs.) 
1818,MEGARA: An officer was to identify her when we reached our destination.
1819,
1820,DOCTOR: But all the officers are dead. 
1821,MEGARA: Yes. 
1822,DOCTOR: Then you have no way of knowing who she is. 
1823,"VIVIEN: All this is irrelevant, your Honours. The accused is merely"
1824,trying to delay his long overdue execution. 
1825,MEGARA 2: Agreed. 
1826,DOCTOR: She is Cessair of Diplos! 
1827,VIVIEN: Prove it. 
1828,DOCTOR: Why else is she here in hyperspace? What's the ship doing here?
1829,
1830,"MEGARA 2: That is not proof, that is supposition. "
1831,"VIVIEN: I am Vivien Fay of Rose Cottage, Boscawen. Ask anyone in"
1832,"Boscawen, they will identify me. "
1833,MEGARA 2: These proceedings must now be terminated. Prepare to
1834,eliminate the accused. 
1835, [Stone circle] 
1836, ROMANA: Right. We can prove she's got a non-Terran
1837,"metabolism, comes from a class G planet, and we even know the date of"
1838,her arrival on Earth. 
1839,EMILIA: We do? 
1840,"ROMANA: Well, how long's this circle been here? "
1841,EMILIA: About two thousand BC. Nearly four thousand years. 
1842,ROMANA: That's when she arrived. 
1843,"EMILIA: Of course. Ready, chaps. "
1844,(The Ogri arrives.) 
1845,ROMANA: K9! 
1846, [Spaceship] 
1847," MEGARA: Prepare yourself to die, Doctor. "
1848,(The Doctor throws his briefs and wig onto the floor.) 
1849,DOCTOR: Do you usually execute your own clients? 
1850,MEGARA: We are allowed to execute only prisoners who have been found
1851,guilty. 
1852,"DOCTOR: Mmm. Well, it certainly adds a new dimension to the role of"
1853,"defending counsel. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Aren't you supposed to"
1854,"be offering me a last toffee apple or something? A blindfold, a hearty"
1855,"breakfast, a free pardon? No? "
1856,"MEGARA: Too late, Doctor. Goodbye. "
1857,DOCTOR: Ah. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. 
1858,(A Megara emits a beam of energy as the Doctor shakes Vivien's hand.
1859,They both get thrown to the floor.) 
1860, [Stone circle] 
1861," K9: Mistress, speed imperative. I cannot hold him."
1862,
1863,"ROMANA: Quickly, beam me through. "
1864, [Spaceship] 
1865, (The Doctor wakes.) 
1866,DOCTOR: Hello. Did I short-circuit? 
1867,MEGARA: Why did you try to involve Miss Fay in your execution? 
1868,DOCTOR: Is she all right? 
1869,MEGARA: We have no legal authority to kill her. 
1870,"DOCTOR: Well, I know, I know, but can you reach her memory cells? "
1871,MEGARA: Why should we do that? 
1872,"DOCTOR: Well, her brain might be damaged. "
1873,MEGARA: We will check. 
1874,MEGARA 2: I am reaching her memory cells. This humanoid is not Vivien
1875,Fay. She is Cessair of Diplos. Wait. She is guilty of the theft and
1876,misuse of the Great Seal of Diplos. Also of removing silicon based
1877,lifeforms from the planet Ogros in contravention of article seven five
1878,"nine four of the Galactic Charter, and employing them for her own ends."
1879,
1880,DOCTOR: You see? All you had to do was read her memory cells. 
1881,"MEGARA 2: According to article three, subsection one three five of the"
1882,"legal code, we the Megara, are not permitted to read the memory cells"
1883,"of any beings, except when they are unable to present their evidence by"
1884,"reason of death, unconsciousness or natural stupidity. "
1885,(Vivien wakes.) 
1886,ROMANA: Stop! I have new evidence. 
1887,DOCTOR: Too late. I've just been executed. 
1888,ROMANA: What? 
1889,DOCTOR: There's an Ogri behind you. 
1890,ROMANA: No! The Professor must have let it through. 
1891,MEGARA: Stop! We are the Megara. I command you to stop. 
1892,"VIVIEN: Ogri, what's happening? "
1893,"MEGARA: Ogri, you will be confined to a cell on this vessel until you"
1894,can be returned to your home planet. 
1895,VIVIEN: No! 
1896,"MEGARA 2: Cessair of Diplos, you have been tried and found guilty of"
1897,"the following charges. Impersonating a religious personage, to wit, a"
1898,"Celtic goddess, for which the penalty is imprisonment for one thousand"
1899,"five hundred years. Theft of the Great Seal of Diplos, for which the"
1900,penalty is perpetual imprisonment. The sentences to run consecutively.
1901,Have you anything to say before sentence is passed? 
1902, [Stone circle] 
1903, (The Doctor and Romana are already present when
1904,Vivien and the Megara appear.) 
1905,"EMILIA: Vivien, what are those things? "
1906,"DOCTOR: Those, Professor, are the Megara. Justice machines. They're"
1907,about to carry out their sentence. I'd stand back if I were you. (to
1908,Vivien) Hello. 
1909,"VIVIEN: If you let them do this to me, Doctor, you'll never find what"
1910,you're looking for. 
1911,"DOCTOR: Oh, I wouldn't go as far as that. Excuse me, gentlemen, I think"
1912,this belongs to me. 
1913,(The Doctor snatches Vivien's pendant necklace.) 
1914,MEGARA 2: Sentence will be carried out. Perpetual imprisonment. 
1915,"(Vivien backs away slightly, then tenses. The Megara turn her into a"
1916,new standing stone in the circle.) 
1917,"DOCTOR: Well, that's your business completed. "
1918,"MEGARA: Not quite, Doctor. "
1919,"DOCTOR: What do you mean, not quite? "
1920,MEGARA: There is still the matter of your delayed execution. 
1921,"DOCTOR: Delayed? Oh, I wouldn't bother about that, if I were you. "
1922,(He touches them with the pendant and they vanish.) 
1923,"DOCTOR: Bye, bye. Happy journey! "
1924,ROMANA: Where are they going? 
1925,DOCTOR: Back to Diplos. I took the liberty of fixing the controls on
1926,their ship before we popped back here. It should give us a couple of
1927,"thousand years grace. Come on, we can't stand around here. We've got"
1928,things to do. Come along. 
1929, [Earthworks] 
1930, (Back at the Tardis.) 
1931,"DOCTOR: Come on, K9. "
1932,"(The Doctor enters the Tardis. Romana and Emilia walk along a track,"
1933,carrying the hyperspace window generator.) 
1934,"EMILIA: Poor Vivien. I can't help feeling sorry for her, but she hasn't"
1935,finished making trouble yet. 
1936,ROMANA: What do you mean? 
1937,EMILIA: The Nine Travellers. They'll have to be surveyed all over
1938,"again. Oh, that'll put the cat amongst the pigeons, believe me. "
1939,"DOCTOR: Professor, you could write a monograph about it. "
1940,"EMILIA: Ah yes, and make Idwal Morgan look a fool. "
1941,ROMANA: Will you write everything that happened? 
1942,EMILIA: Certainly not. I do have my academic reputation to consider.
1943,"Funny, I never noticed a police box there before. "
1944,"ROMANA: Goodbye, Professor, and thank you for everything. "
1945,(Romana joins the Doctor and K9 in the Tardis.) 
1946,EMILIA: Goodbye? Where 
1947,(The Tardis dematerialises.) 
1948,EMILIA: I do have my academic reputation to consider. 
1949, [Tardis side room] 
1950, (Romana gets the two pieces of the Key out of the
1951,safe.) 
1952,DOCTOR: The tracer. 
1953,(She hands it over. The Doctor touches the pendant.) 
1954,"ROMANA: Doctor, is Earth always like that? "
1955,(The pendant transforms into another polygon.) 
1956,DOCTOR: Sometimes it's even exciting. 
1957,ROMANA: Oh. 
1958,DOCTOR: Now. 
1959,"(He tries to fit the three pieces together, and fails.) "
