21, [Tardis]
22,
23, (A series of energy bolts hit the Tardis while it
24,is in flight. We go inside to see Mel and the Doctor lying unconcious
25,on the floor. The exercise bike collapses. An reptile-descended
26,lifeform watches a rainbow swoosh across the sky then the Tardis lands
27,"in a rocky landscape. The doors open and the Rani enters, carrying a"
28,ray gun.) 
29,RANI: Leave the girl. It's the man I want. Take him to my laboratory. 
30,"(The Rani leaves, and her giant hairy bat servant rolls the Doctor over"
31,onto his back just as his features finish regenerating. Everyone say
32,Hi! to my second-favourite Doctor - Sylvester McCoy.)
33,
34, [Genius room]
35,
36, (Built into a cliff face. Another of the local
37,lifeforms is gently lying a familiar human with wild grey hair and
38,moustache onto a couch in an cabinet. She is overseen by an older male.
39,The Rani enters.) 
40,"RANI: Sarn, stop dithering. Collecting this one has already put me"
41,behind schedule. 
42,SARN: I don't want to harm him. 
43,RANI: Seal it and label it. 
44,(Sarn activates the cabinet. The couch slides in and a transparent door
45,comes down.) 
46,"RANI: Well, what are you waiting for? "
47,BEYUS: You haven't given the name for the label. 
48,RANI: Einstein. 
49,(Einstein lights up above the cabinet.) 
50,"RANI: Insolence could cost your people dearly, Beyus. "
51,SARN: I'm sure Beyus did not mean to appear insolent. He would never do
52,that. 
53,RANI: I find your incompetence more than enough without listening to
54,your puerile opinions. 
55,"BEYUS: Then why not let Sarn go. You have me as a hostage, you don't"
56,need her. 
57,RANI: I shall decide my needs. They unfortunately require the use of
58,Lakertyans. 
59,BEYUS: You leave me with no illusions about the hatred that you hold
60,for us. 
61,RANI: Hatred? Another fantasy. I have no feelings one way or the other.
62,Outside of these experiments you have absolutely no significance. 
63,BEYUS: I find your detachment difficult to understand. 
64,"RANI: All you need understand is that these specimens are geniuses,"
65,"every one of them. And unless they're kept in prime condition, you'll"
66,have more than the miserable skin of this creature to worry about. 
67,BEYUS: Have you managed to procure the means to repair your laboratory
68,equipment? 
69,"RANI: Oh yes, indeed I have."
70,
71, [The Rani's laboratory]
72,
73, (She walks into the main part of her lair. The
74,"Doctor is lying across a square table, with a multicoloured but normal"
75,size umbrella by his outstretched left arm. The Rani checks his pupil
76,"response and his heartbeats, then goes to a steep flight of stairs,"
77,presses a button to open the door at the top and starts to climb.) 
78,"DOCTOR: No, no, Mel. "
79,"(The Rani comes back, closes the door and returns to the Doctor."
80,Suddenly he sits up.) 
81,"DOCTOR: That was a nice nap. Now, down to business. "
82,(The Doctor gets off the table.) 
83,DOCTOR: I'm a bit worried about the temporal flicker in sector
84,thirteen. There's a bicentennial refit of the Tardis to book in. I must
85,just pop over to Centauri Seven and then perhaps a quick holiday.
86,"Right, that all seems quite clear. Just three small points. Where am I?"
87,Who am I? And who are you? The Rani! Stay back! 
88,(He grabs his umbrella then steps back and falls down a short set of
89,stairs. Sylvester is a very good clown-tumbler.) 
90,RANI: This is idiotic. You'll injure yourself. 
91,"DOCTOR: Why should you care? Since you were exiled from Gallifrey,"
92,you've had nothing but contempt for all other Time Lords. 
93,RANI: My contempt started long before my exile. 
94,DOCTOR: And what do you want with me? And where's Mel? 
95,"RANI: She's perfectly safe, but how long she remains so depends on you."
96,
97,DOCTOR: You're up to something. Perhaps I'll find the answer on this. 
98,(The Doctor activates the screen in the middle of the table.) 
99,"RANI: You won't recognise the planet. It's Lakertya, and there's no"
100,evidence that it's ever been graced by your meddling presence. 
101,(The screen shows the planet from orbit then an asteroid. Alien
102,characters come up.) 
103,"DOCTOR: You're trying to deflect me, so the answer is on here. Quarks."
104,"One up, one down. One strange matter? That asteroid is composed of"
105,strange matter. What monstrous experiment are you dabbling in now? 
106,RANI: I didn't go to the trouble of bringing you here just to discuss
107,the ethics of my work. 
108,DOCTOR: Ethics? Don't be such a hypocrite. Your past is littered with
109,the mutilated results of your unethical experiments. 
110,RANI: I had all I can take of that cant in our university days. Am I
111,expected to abandon my research because of the side effects on inferior
112,species. Are you prepared to abandon walking in case you squash an
113,insect underfoot? 
114,(The Rani takes her ray gun from the table base.) 
115,"DOCTOR: Stay away. Whatever you've brought me here for, I'm having no"
116,part of it. 
117,(And promptly tumbles down the two steps again. Sarn moves to pick him
118,up.) 
119,RANI: Leave him there. 
120,SARN: He may be hurt. 
121,"BEYUS: Sarn, don't interfere. "
122,RANI: I'll deal with you latter. 
123,(Sarn runs out.) 
124,RANI: And that's the last time she will interfere. 
125,"(The Doctor gets up and goes to a pyramid, one of four placed around"
126,the raised table dais.) 
127,DOCTOR: Stay away or I'll smash this! 
128,RANI: Urak! 
129,DOCTOR: I'll smash it to pieces! 
130,"RANI: Urak, get in here! "
131,"(The hairy beast enters. The Doctor stares at it, and it fires a little"
132,cannon that releases a net which drops over the Doctors head. He falls.
133,
134,"Meanwhile, the Lakertyan who watched the Tardis lands enters its open"
135,door. He stands over Mel for a moment then picks her up and puts her
136,"over his shoulder, looks around and leaves. "
137,Sarn flees the Rani's headquarters. The Rani's large wrist computer
138,beeps.) 
139,"RANI: Urak, what's happening? "
140,"URAK : The female Sarn has escaped, Mistress Rani. "
141,RANI: She won't get far. 
142,(The Rani calls up the view of Sarn running on her table screen.
143,"Elsewhere, Mel wakes and frees herself from the man's hold, and runs"
144,for her life. She meets Sarn coming the other way. Sarn changes route
145,and hits a trip wire. There is a flash and a scream. Sarn is trapped in
146,a spinning bubble that flies into the air and bounces off one cliff
147,edge before crashing into another and exploding. Mel's rescuer pushes
148,her away and goes over to the skeletal remains of Sarn. 
149,The Rani turns off the image of the skeleton and uses her wrist
150,computerr.) 
151,RANI: See that the trap is reset. 
152,"URAK : Certainly. Your powers are truly wondrous, Mistress Rani. "
153,BEYUS: What's happened? 
154,RANI: It need not concern you. Roll up his sleeve. 
155,(Beyus obeys. The Doctor is unconscious.) 
156,BEYUS: Why are you doing this? 
157,RANI: To make sure he suffers a healthy dose of amnesia when he wakes. 
158,(The Rani injects the Doctor with a needle from a large gun.) 
159,BEYUS: Amnesia? 
160,RANI: That's what I said.
161,
162, [Lakertya]
163,
164," IKONA: Go on, run. Run! The area's full of traps,"
165,as well you know. 
166,MEL: Me? Why should I? This is insane. 
167,IKONA: Don't play the innocent. Your friends set this trap. 
168,"MEL: Look, it's all very well being upset "
169,IKONA: Upset? Another of your obscene murders takes place 
170,MEL: Stop accusing me. This had nothing to do with me. 
171,"IKONA: Lies! If I didn't need you as a hostage, you'd be dead. "
172,MEL: A hostage? For what? 
173,IKONA: To exchange for our leader. Your friends took him prisoner. 
174,MEL: Why do you keep calling them friends of mine? 
175,"IKONA: You arrived from outer space, as they did. Now they can have you"
176,back. On my terms.
177,
178, [The Rani's laboratory]
179,
180,"(The Doctor wakes, feeling very dizzy.) "
181,DOCTOR: Where am I? Who are you? 
182,"(From the back, it looks like Mel. She turns around and it is the Rani."
183,She pitches her voice almost perfectly to imitate her.) 
184,"RANI: Mel. Melanie. Are you all right, Doctor? "
185,(She pulls the Doctor to his feet.) 
186,DOCTOR: All right? Am I? Of course. And you? 
187,"RANI: Me? Yes, of course. Why not? "
188,DOCTOR: Why not indeed. We both are. 
189,(The Doctor stumbles and picks up the weapon she had carried into the
190,Tardis.) 
191,DOCTOR: A bull in a barber shop. A navigational guidance system
192,distorter. This would force any passing spaceship into landing here.
193,"Where are we, by the way? "
194,"RANI: In your laboratory. On Lakertya. Doctor, are you sure you're"
195,well? 
196,DOCTOR: Of course. Fit as a trombone. 
197,RANI: Fiddle. 
198,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
199,RANI: Fit as a fiddle. 
200,"DOCTOR: Are you? Nerves, I expect. Now, let's see. What were we up to,"
201,"er, Mel, did you say your name was? "
202,"RANI: You don't remember me, do you? Do you? "
203,DOCTOR: Red hair. I recall red hair. 
204,"(The Rani moves away to stop the Doctor touching her wig, and she gets"
205,reflected in a nearby pyramid.) 
206,DOCTOR: Argh! Who's that? 
207,RANI: Me. 
208,"DOCTOR: No, standing next to you. "
209,"RANI: That's you, Doctor. "
210,DOCTOR: Me? No wonder I've lost my memory. 
211,"RANI: Look, you're supposed to be conducting an experiment, not"
212,frightening yourself to death. 
213,DOCTOR: Experiment? 
214,"RANI: Yes, it exploded and threw you to the floor. Me, too. Knocked us"
215,both cold. When I came round you looked like this. 
216,DOCTOR: The explosion must have caused me to regenerate. 
217,"RANI: You mean, this is what you're going to be like permanently. "
218,DOCTOR: I want all mirrors removed from the Tardis henceforth. 
219,"RANI: So you remember the Tardis, then? "
220,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, the Tardis. And you. Mel. There's something not quite in"
221,sync. I must be suffering from post-regeneration amnesia. 
222,"RANI: Oh, don't worry. It'll soon wear off. Meanwhile, why not repair"
223,the machine? You said it was important. 
224,DOCTOR: Important? Did I? I wonder what I was up to. 
225,(The Doctor takes the cover off the large metal pyramid with charring
226,by a grill and peers inside.) 
227,"DOCTOR: No, seems pretty far gone. Need a genius to unravel it. "
228,RANI: But you're a genius. 
229,"DOCTOR: Oh yes, I definitely remember that. "
230,RANI: Especially in thermodynamics. 
231,"DOCTOR: How did you know that, Mel? "
232,RANI: You told me. You said it was your special subject when you were
233,at university. 
234,DOCTOR: University? You remind me of someone I used to know when I was
235,there. 
236,"RANI: Doctor, this machine has to be repaired and you're the only"
237,person with the knowledge to do it. 
238,"DOCTOR: Your confidence in me is very flattering, Mel. "
239,(The Rani takes another side off the pyramid.)
240,
241, [Lakertya]
242,
243, (Ikona has tied Mel's hands and is leading her
244,with a rope down a steep slope.) 
245,MEL: Will you listen? How many more times do I have to tell you I'm not
246,"your enemy. Look, can we start from scratch? My name's Mel and I come"
247,from Earth. Your turn. 
248,IKONA: This is no game. 
249,"MEL: All right, let's try another tack. You claim I was alone when you"
250,found me. 
251,"IKONA: Oh, don't go on about this Doctor again. "
252,MEL: I have to. 
253,"IKONA: There was no one else in the strange box. If he exists, he must"
254,have left you. 
255,MEL: No way. The Doctor wouldn't do that. 
256,IKONA: If he has any sense he would. 
257,MEL: It's not even up for discussion. 
258,"IKONA: Good, I shall enjoy the silence. "
259,MEL: Watch out! 
260,(Ikona trips a wire but Mel pulls him back before he can get trapped in
261,the bubble. It whirrs off to explode on the cliff face.) 
262,MEL: Now will you accept that I'm not your enemy? 
263,IKONA: We must hurry. The Tetraps will come to investigate. 
264,(Ikona unties Mel's wrists.) 
265,MEL: What made you think I was in league with them? 
266,IKONA: You're not Lakertyan. You don't belong on this planet. 
267,"MEL: Then they're human, like me? "
268,"IKONA: No, not like you, although almost as hideous. "
269,(Urak watches them from the top of a ridge.)
270,
271, [The Rani's laboratory]
272,
273, (The Doctor's idea of mending machinery is to make
274,it go bang and spark.) 
275,"DOCTOR: Come on, come on. "
276,RANI: Come on where? 
277,"DOCTOR: Why I chose you as an assistant, I'll never know. Perhaps I"
278,will when I've regained my memory. 
279,"RANI: Well, what is it you want? "
280,"DOCTOR: Well, look at me. Can't you see? Mop my brow! "
281,(The Rani uses a handkerchief then turns away. The Doctor takes two
282,"spoon-shaped implements from a rack, places them back to back and plays"
283,them. When he uses the Rani for the percussion she knocks them out of
284,his hand.) 
285,DOCTOR: What'd you do that for? 
286,RANI: It was your fault. 
287,DOCTOR: A bad workman always blames his fools. 
288,RANI: Tools! Blames his tools! 
289,"DOCTOR: Do I detect a hint of bad temper, Mel? Why are you behaving so"
290,uppity? Could it be that you think yourself superior to me? 
291,"RANI: Now how could I possibly think that, Doctor? "
292,DOCTOR: Quite. Though at the moment I feel far from superior. This is
293,all a mystery to me. 
294,RANI: But surely there's a catalyst? 
295,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes. Must you state the obvious? I know that its"
296,functions diffuse the impulses from there with this goo. But what's it
297,for? I'm beginning to think this set-up's got nothing to do with me. 
298,RANI: Why do you think that? 
299,DOCTOR: Omnipotence. The mind behind this bag of tricks operates on a
300,grand scale. 
301,"RANI: Well, all the more reason to suppose that it's you, Doctor."
302,
303,[Lakertya]
304,
305, MEL: Hold on. I need a breather. 
306,IKONA: We must keep moving. 
307,MEL: What happened to the rest of your people? Won't they help? 
308,"IKONA: No, they've been completely subdued. "
309,MEL: We could at least try. 
310,"IKONA: The only one they listen to is Beyus, our leader. "
311,"MEL: All right, let's go to him. "
312,IKONA: He's the hostage I wanted to exchange you for. Shush. Listen. 
313,(Rocks fall nearby.) 
314,IKONA: Quickly! 
315,"MEL: We can't go that way, it's completely exposed. "
316,"IKONA: For once, don't argue. "
317,(They follow a track through a large puddle and into a large sewer
318,pipe.) 
319,IKONA: Hopefully they'll think we doubled back to stay undercover. 
320,MEL: Always providing they don't flush us out first.
321,
322, [The Rani's laboratory]
323,
324, (The Doctor is pointing up the stairs.) 
325,DOCTOR: What's in there? 
326,RANI: I have no idea. 
327,"DOCTOR: Are you as clueless as you appear, Mel? "
328,"RANI: Don't blame me, Doctor. I've never been inside. You wouldn't let"
329,me. 
330,DOCTOR: Wouldn't I? 
331,RANI: No. You said the air wasn't sterile enough for humans. 
332,"DOCTOR: That's it, then. I'm doing nothing until my memory returns."
333,Nothing until I know what I'm about. 
334,"RANI: Oh, come on, now. "
335,"DOCTOR: No, I will not work in the dark like this. "
336,RANI: But you thrive on challenge. 
337,DOCTOR: I'm adamant. This could be some diabolical scheme. 
338,RANI: To do what? 
339,DOCTOR: That's the question. 
340,"RANI: Oh, Doctor, really. "
341,"(Behind his back, the Rani opens a lid in the corner of the table and"
342,takes out a small bottle. 
343,"Meanwhile, in another part of her HQ, Beyus picks up a bill hook, goes"
344,"to a grill set at an angle in the floor and opens it, then goes down"
345,some steps. In the dark are more hairy monsters like Urak. Beyus pulls
346,a chain that releases red goo to run down a channel in the middle of
347,"the steps, then leaves and fastens the grill shut. "
348,"The Rani pours the contents of the bottle into a glass of blue water,"
349,turning it clear. She puts the bottle back in its hole and takes the
350,glass to the Doctor. 
351,") RANI: You're just over-excited. Here, drink this. "
352,DOCTOR: Hmm? What is it? 
353,RANI: Just water. 
354,"DOCTOR: Oh, you drink it. I don't want it. Don't try to humour me."
355,Leave me alone. 
356,RANI: You can't loll around. It's simply not like you. 
357,"DOCTOR: How do you know what I'm like? I've regenerated. I mean, look"
358,at me. Look at me. 
359,"RANI: Yes, you've changed outwardly. But I'm sure you must still have"
360,the same sweet nature. 
361,"DOCTOR: Perhaps this is my new persona. Sulky, bad-tempered. I mean,"
362,think how I spoke to you earlier. 
363,RANI: But you didn't mean it. I was at fault. 
364,"DOCTOR: Even so, that's probably how I am now. You don't understand"
365,"regeneration, Mel. It's a lottery, and I've drawn the short plank."
366,"Anyway, I need a radiation wave meter and, brilliant as I am, even I"
367,can't improvise that. 
368,RANI: What about the Tardis? Won't there be a radiation wave meter
369,there? 
370,DOCTOR: The Tardis? Do you know where it is? 
371,"RANI: Yes, of course. "
372,"DOCTOR: Oh, good. I fancy a breath of fresh air. We'll both go. "
373,"RANI: No, wait. "
374,(The Doctor leaves. The Rani uses her wrist computer.) 
375,RANI: Urak? 
376,"URAK : Yes, mistress? "
377,RANI: Remove the girl from the Tardis immediately. 
378,"URAK : She is not there, mistress. "
379,"RANI: Well then, find her, you incompetent fool! "
380,(The Doctor enters.) 
381,"DOCTOR: Are you coming, Mel? "
382,"RANI: Yes, Doctor, coming."
383,
384, [Lakertya]
385,
386,(Mel looks out of the pipe.) 
387,MEL: No one about. Come on. 
388,IKONA: No! It's too soon. 
389,MEL: Not for me. I'm going to find the Doctor. 
390,"IKONA: If he's been captured, he's as good as dead. "
391,"(Meanwhile, the Rani and the Doctor have reached Sarn's remains.) "
392,DOCTOR: Rather unusual species. Can't say I recognise it. Humanoid with
393,"reptilian influences, wouldn't you say, Mel? "
394,RANI: Lakertyan. A race so indolent they can't be bothered to bury
395,their dead. 
396,DOCTOR: Really? I suppose we've explored this planet. I wish I could
397,remember. 
398,RANI: There's not a lot to remember. The benevolent climate has induced
399,lethargy. They've failed to realise their full potential. 
400,"DOCTOR: Rather a harsh judgment, Mel. "
401,RANI: Not mine. Yours. 
402,"DOCTOR: The more I know me, the less I like me. "
403,(The Doctor waves Sarn goodbye before he and the Rani cross to the
404,Tardis and go inside.) 
405,"MEL: All right, I'll find him without you. One thing about the Doctor,"
406,you can't miss him in that outfit.
407,
408,[Wardrobe room]
409,
410,"(The traditional post-regeneration scene. First up,"
411,a Napoleon costume.) 
412,"DOCTOR: No, I think not. Lacks my natural humility. "
413,(He tries on a Bearskin hat.) 
414,DOCTOR: Doesn't look right without a horse. I need something more
415,"dignified, Timelord-ish. "
416,(A school master's mortar board and gown.) 
417,"DOCTOR: A little portentous, perhaps, Mel? "
418,RANI: Pretentious is the word. 
419,"(Tom Baker's burgundy coat, hat and scarf.) "
420,DOCTOR: Old hat? 
421,(Jon Pertwee's frilly shirt and velvet jacket.) 
422,"DOCTOR: Not frilled. (Peter Davison's cricketing gear, with bat and"
423,pads.) 
424,DOCTOR: How's that? Would that bowl a maiden over? 
425,(Patrick Troughton's fur coat. He flings it open to reveal a question
426,mark motif pullover and red braces under a cream linen jacket. He has
427,kept the panama hat.) 
428,"RANI: Yes, yes, yes. Very elegant. "
429,"DOCTOR: Ah, thank goodness in this regeneration I've regained my"
430,impeccable sense of haute couture. 
431,(The Doctor looks in the mirror to adjust his tie.) 
432,"RANI: If you've finished preening, could we please get what we came"
433,for? 
434,(The Doctor turns and starts to see that this Mel is not the real Mel.
435,"She slaps his face.) RANI: I'm sorry, but you seemed to be losing"
436,control. 
437,DOCTOR: I was hallucinating. I had an overwhelming sense of evil. And
438,"there was a word. Ra, Ra, Ran, Rad "
439,RANI: Radiation wave meter. That's what we came here for. 
440,DOCTOR: Oh yes. Where do you reckon I'd keep it? 
441,RANI: Tool room. 
442,DOCTOR: Won't be a jiffy. Absence makes the nose grow longer. (The
443,Doctor leaves.) 
444,RANI: Cretin.
445,
446, [Tardis]
447,
448," (Mel picks her way through large rocks, watched by"
449,Ikona and Urak. 
450,The Rani answers her wrist computer.) 
451,"RANI: Yes, Urak. What is it? "
452,"URAK : We have found the lost girl, mistress. "
453,RANI: Focus in on her. 
454,"URAK : Certainly, Mistress Rani. "
455,(The Rani turns on the scanner. The Doctor enters with the meter.) 
456,"DOCTOR: Rani, that's the name, the evil name. "
457,"RANI: Is that her, Doctor? "
458,"DOCTOR: Er, well, yes, it must be. Yes. "
459,RANI: And she's evil? 
460,DOCTOR: Completely. 
461,RANI: Then she must be destroyed. 
462,DOCTOR: Destroyed? Let's not be hasty.

466,(Mel spots Urak behind her and starts to run. She
467,trips a wire and gets trapped in a bubble. Ikona stares in horror as it
468,rises into the air.) 
469,MEL: Doctor! Help! 
470,(The bubble sails over a ridge and bounces once.) 
471,MEL: Help!

475,
476,MEL: Help! 
477,(Mel's bubble splashes into a lake and rolls across the surface to the
478,shore. Ikona runs to her aid. It has beached with the base tilted up
479,for handy access.) 
480,MEL: Help! Help me! 
481,IKONA: Be quiet and don't move. 
482,"MEL: Have you, have you done this before? "
483,"IKONA: No, this is the first time, but Mel, if you don't stop"
484,"squawking, it'll be the last. "
485,(Ikona twists a boss on the base of the bubble.)

489, (There is another small explosion and lots of
490,smoke.) 
491,"DOCTOR: You know, I can't help feeling sorry for the Rani, Mel, getting"
492,caught in her own devious trap. 
493,RANI: She's got nobody to blame but herself. 
494,"DOCTOR: I suppose so, but what was she doing prowling around on"
495,Lakertya? 
496,"RANI: Well, I'd have thought the reason was obvious. "
497,DOCTOR: Is it? 
498,RANI: She must be on the brink of a major discovery. 
499,DOCTOR: Have to be a cosmic breakthrough for a neurochemist of her
500,stature to come storming the barricades. 
501,"RANI: All the more reason to press on, get there first. You've"
502,"repeatedly said that in the wrong hands, scientific knowledge can be"
503,dangerous. 
504,DOCTOR: What scientific knowledge? What am I doing? If only I could
505,remember. 
506,"RANI/RANI: Oh, don't start all that again. Look, repair the machine and"
507,maybe we'll find the solution. 
508,"DOCTOR: The machine won't tell me what's behind that locked door, will"
509,"it? The machine won't restore my memory, will it? If the Rani was after"
510,"our experiment, we must be playing with fire. "
511,"RANI: Oh, forget the Rani. She's finished, destroyed. "
512,"DOCTOR: Is she? Oh, don't underestimate her. She's a brilliant but"
513,sterile mind. There's not one spark of decency in her. 
514,RANI: I'm overwhelmed. 
515,DOCTOR: You are? 
516,RANI: Such superior diagnostic talents. 
517,DOCTOR: It's my forte. 
518,"RANI: Well then, it's a pity they can't be concentrated on the machine."
519,
520,(The Rani pushes the Doctor against the machine. He bumps his nose. By
521,"the water, Ikona defuses the bubble and it vanishes. He throws the tube"
522,"of explosive into the lake, where it goes Boom! Urak watches and"
523,snarls. 
524,"Later, the Rani is monitoring the progress of the asteroid while the"
525,Doctor works in the bowels of the pyramid.) 
526,"DOCTOR: And another thing. Why was the Rani dressed like you, Mel? "
527,RANI: Perhaps she's fashion conscious. 
528,DOCTOR: No. She was in disguise. Practising another one of her talents.
529,
530,"RANI: Really? Are you going to be much longer in there, Doctor? "
531,DOCTOR: Afraid so. More hasta less vista.

538,"MEL: Look. Look, look, I'm grateful for your help, of course, but"
539,gratitude isn't going to turn me into a puppet. 
540,IKONA: I've already come to that painful conclusion. 
541,"MEL: Well then, tell me, are we just running scared or are we heading"
542,for somewhere in particular? 
543,IKONA: The answer to both questions is yes. Now can we go? 
544,(Ikona points to an opening near the top of a cliff.) 
545,IKONA: Wait here. 
546,"(He climbs up to a cache of metal items, and takes one.) "
547,"MEL: Hurry, Ikona! Hurry! "
548,"(Urak jumps down behind Mel, who screams as only she can at the sight"
549,"of the four-eyed creature. Ikona fires the metal item at him, sending a"

559,RANI: Let me. 
560,(It has a large hole burnt right through it.) 
561,RANI: What was the mistake? 
562,DOCTOR: The heat radiation from the catalyst was of high frequency. 
563,"RANI: You mean I, you used the wrong heat conducting material? "
564,DOCTOR: So elementary. I broke the second law of thermodynamics. 
565,"RANI: So, if we substituted a suitable material, would it work? "
566,"DOCTOR: You should know the answer to that, Mel. Didn't C P Snow"
567,expound on thermodynamics? 
568,"RANI: Doctor, is this relevant? "
569,"DOCTOR: Well, you said you admired all his writings, read all his"
570,books. 
571,"RANI: Did I? Oh, I must have forgotten. "
572,"DOCTOR: You, Mel, forget? A kangaroo never forgets. "
573,RANI: Elephant. 
574,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Memory like an elephant. A running gag applied to you,"
575,"I feel sure, Mel. "
576,"RANI: Oh. Perhaps the machine exploding affected my memory too. Doctor,"
577,what were the readings? 
578,"DOCTOR: Oh here, see for yourself. "
579,"(He gives her the gizmo and goes up the stairs, where he uses a device"
580,to listen to what is going on beyond the closed door.)

585,"MEL: Well then, that's where the Doctor must be. "
586,IKONA: You can't be sure. 
587,MEL: I can. You don't know the Doctor. 
588,"IKONA: If he's in there, I probably never will. "
589,MEL: There's no if about it. He's in there. 
590,(She looks up at the construction above the main entrance.) 
591,MEL: Any idea what the central ramp's for? 
592,IKONA: No. All I know is that building it cost the lives of many
593,Lakertyans. 
594,MEL: Something must have gone terribly wrong. 
595,IKONA: The logic of that escapes me. 
596,"MEL: Well, they kidnapped the Doctor, and no one would do that unless"
597,they were desperate for his help. He's not exactly predictable. 
598,IKONA: Come on.

604,RANI: I asked you a question! 
605,"DOCTOR: Did you? Mel, there's something caged in there. "
606,"RANI: Yes, I dare say. Would PHB or PES do? "
607,DOCTOR: Eh? 
608,RANI: As a suitable material for the machine. 
609,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. PHB. It's biodegradable. We don't want to litter up"
610,"Lakertya with non-destructible waste like they're doing on your planet,"
611,Mel. 
612,RANI: What are you looking for? 
613,DOCTOR: Sugar and starch. We can ferment our own. 
614,RANI: You won't find it there. What about the alternative? 
615,"DOCTOR: PES? No, not so good. It's a petroleum based plastic. "
616,"RANI: Slightly amber, almost opaque? "
617,DOCTOR: Mmm. 
618,RANI: I know where I can get some. 
619,DOCTOR: Where? 
620,"RANI: From the Lakertyans. You repair the machine, I'll go and get it. "
621,DOCTOR: But I thought you said the Lakertyans weren't very advanced.

623,DOCTOR: Yes.

634,(Every one say Hi! to  Wanda

636,"FAROON: I'm glad to see you, Ikona, although I shouldn't be. "
637,IKONA: Does sitting on opposite sides of the fence mean we can't still
638,be friends? 
639,FAROON: I'm afraid it does when you cut yourself off from the rest of
640,"us, and deliberately ignore Beyus' instructions. "
641,IKONA: I can't accept he's right to collaborate. 
642,FAROON: He is being held hostage. He has no choice. It's the only way
643,that Beyus can save the rest of us from destruction. 
644,"MEL: He didn't save her, did he. "
645,"IKONA: It's all right, Faroon. She's not with the Tetraps. "
646,FAROON: You said her? 
647,"MEL: Yes. Well, she was running away from something. "
648,"FAROON: You saw what happened too, Ikona? You're not usually so"
649,reluctant to air your thoughts. From which direction did she come? 
650,"MEL: Well, along there. It was as though she was escaping from the"
651,Tetrap headquarters. 
652,IKONA: It was Sarn. 
653,(Faroon goes to the skeleton.) 
654,MEL: Who was Sarn? 
655,IKONA: The daughter of Faroon and Beyus. 
656,MEL: I'm sorry. I didn't realise. 
657,"FAROON: I, I had to be told. "
658,IKONA: There was nothing to be done. She stepped on a trap. 
659,FAROON: Yet another victim. I must go to Beyus. 
660,(Faroon walks away. Mel starts to follow her.) 
661,IKONA: Where are you going? 
662,MEL: If Beyus is collaborating then he must be in the Tetrap

668,to work out the combination to open the door. He retrieves the spoons
669,and starts playing them again. Using them on the back of his neck
670,hurts. 
671,Mel and Ikona hide as Faroon walks up to the entrance.) 
672,IKONA: You're still determined to get in? 
673,MEL: No matter what the risk.

722,MEL: Don't touch me! 
723,"DOCTOR: Ah, the proof of the pumpkin's in the squeezing. "
724,"MEL: You don't even talk like the Doctor, you miserable fraud. "
725,"DOCTOR: Let me feel your pulse. Pulses, I should say. Two of them. One"
726,for each heart. 
727,MEL: You're a raving lunatic. 
728,"DOCTOR: Yes, perhaps I am, because if you're the Rani, I'm dicing with"
729,destruction. 
730,MEL: And if I'm Mel? 
731,DOCTOR: Mel? The worst she'll do is give me carrot juice. Carrot juice?
732,What made me think of that?

735,DOCTOR: Favourite? I hate it. 
736,MEL: Oh. 
737,"DOCTOR: Ah, caught you out, haven't I. "
738,"MEL: But if you're the real Doctor, then why do you look like that? "
739,"DOCTOR: I've regenerated, and I'm suffering from post-regenerative"
740,"amnesia, as far as I can remember. Fair exchange is no mockery. You"
741,"feel my pulses, I'll feel yours. I'll lean across here with my arm"
742,"behind my back, if you want proof I'm a Time Lord. Come on. "
743,(The Doctor holds his arm out across the table. Mel takes his pulses.) 
744,MEL: A double pulse. Then you really are the Doctor. 
745,DOCTOR: That's what I've been trying to tell you. Now yours. 
746,"MEL: I know about regeneration, of course. "
747,(The Doctor checks both her wrists.) 
748,DOCTOR: Mel? 
749,"MEL: But you're completely different. Nothing like you were. Face,"
750,"height, hair, everything's changed. "
751,"DOCTOR: Yes. And I've become more of a fool too, it seems, Mel. Doesn't"
752,"bode well for my seventh persona, being so completely taken in by the"
753,wretched Rani. 
754,MEL: The Rani? Is that who hijacked the Tardis?

774,your Earth year 1984. 
775,"MEL: Computers are my speciality, not nuclear physics. "
776,DOCTOR: It's an incredibly dense form of matter. A lump the size of
777,this would weigh more than your planet Earth. 
778,"MEL: Well, what can the Rani's interest be? "
779,"DOCTOR: An astute question. If that asteroid exploded, it would send"
780,off a blast of gamma rays equivalent to a supernova. 
781,"MEL: And then it'd be goodbye, Lakertya. "
782,DOCTOR: And everything else in this corner of the galaxy. When the Rani

826,many. 
827,DOCTOR: The scope of her imagination is breathtaking. 
828,BEYUS: You sound as though you admire her. 
829,"DOCTOR: Not admiration, fascination. And sadness. If only the Rani"
830,could have redirected her incredible talents for good. 
831,MEL: The fascination's mutual. She's reserved this one for you.

858,"clever you are, Mel. Where did you find it? "
859,"RANI: In the store room. Doctor, why was the monitor on? "
860,"DOCTOR: On, is it? Oh, yes. I was trying to jog my memory. No luck"
861,"though. Hold the other end, Mel. "
862,(They try to slide the sheet into its slot in the pyramid. 
863,"Meanwhile, Beyus points the way for Faroon and Mel to leave the HQ.) "

865,manoeuvre it into position. 
866,"RANI: Quite adept at manoeuvring, aren't you, Doctor? "
867,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, where there's a will, there's a Tom, Dick and a"
868,Harriet. 
869,RANI: Do I take it the machine's now operational? 
870,"DOCTOR: Oh. no, no, no. There's some information I simply must have"
871,before I make the final delicate adjustments. 
872,RANI: Such as? 
873,"DOCTOR: Ideally, what's behind that door? "
874,RANI: Less ideally? 
875,DOCTOR: The identity of this rather interesting substance. 
876,(A liquid or jelly on the top of another pyramid.) 
877,"RANI: The information's essential, is it? "
878,DOCTOR: Crucial. 
879,"RANI: So if I told you its chemical composition, I could do that. "
880,(The Rani presses a button on the table. The lights dim and the pyramid
881,starts flashing.) 
882,"DOCTOR: No, stop! "
883,"RANI: You know, don't you. "
884,(The Rani removes the red curly wig and frees her own brunette hair.) 
885,RANI: But your usefulness is not yet over. You have another role to
886,play. 
887,(The Doctor points behind her. The Rani turns and he uses his scarf to
888,pin her arms and pushes her onto the table. Then he runs into the
889,"Genius room, past Beyus who is making notes on a clipboard. She follows"
890,"him down into the Tetrap pit, and carefully searches amongst the"
891,"Tetraps hanging from the roof, armed with the billhook. Unable to find"

910,FAROON: She's looking for us. 
911,"MEL: Maybe, but I can think of a more likely explanation. The Doctor's"
912,"on the loose. Whatever the reason, Faroon, you mustn't be caught with"
913,me. 
914,FAROON: I can't leave you. I promised. 
915,MEL: I'll be all right. Now go. Please.

920," BEYUS: No, you'll have to escape through the"
921,laboratory. The Rani went that way. 
922,(The Doctor runs into the laboratory.)
923,URAK : Mistress Rani? 
924,(The Doctor runs back in. Urak carefully searches the laboratory then
925,enters. Only Beyus stands there.) 
926,"URAK: You, Lakertyan, have you seen the mistress? Well, quickly,"
927,answer! 
928,BEYUS: She went into the grounds. 
929,"URAK: Oh, out of my way. The mistress has profound insight, but I think"
930,she is mistaken to rely on any of your worthless race. 
931,(Urak leaves. Beyus opens the Doctor's cabinet and lets him out.) 
932,DOCTOR: I can't say I share the Rani's taste in pets. 
933,BEYUS: The Tetraps are nobody's pets and you'd be wise not to forget
934,it. 
935,DOCTOR: This is what I'll never forget. Unique talents every one of
936,them. The Rani's roamed the universe plucking these geniuses out of
937,"time, at the height of their powers and reducing them to the status of"
938,laboratory specimens. 
939,"BEYUS: Doctor, please hurry. "
940,"DOCTOR: Time, the concept of time. I'm sure that's at the heart of what"
941,"she's up to. Otherwise why reserve a place for me, a Time Lord, in this"
942,abysmal parade. 
943,"BEYUS: If you're still here when she gets back, you'll find out from"
944,inside the cabinet. 
945,DOCTOR: Which you will help her put me in. 
946,"BEYUS: If she catches you, yes. "
947,"DOCTOR: You know, Beyus, your collaboration with the Rani's difficult"
948,to understand. 
949,"BEYUS: My people are under threat. If you do manage to escape, go to"
950,"the Centre of Leisure. You will find the reason there. Now hurry,"

954,
955," BEYUS: Be careful, Doctor. The grounds outside are"
956,a minefield of traps. 
957,DOCTOR: Nothing outside compared to this. 
958,BEYUS: A harmless asteroid? 
959,"DOCTOR: It's composed of strange matter, Beyus. A devastating force."
960,"With the right trigger, that harmless asteroid, as you call it, could"
961,incinerate your planet and anything else in this corner of the galaxy.
962,"And what does the Rani keep behind there? Oh, all good things come to a"
963,bend. 
964,(The Doctor goes to the pyramid he repaired and removes a component.
965,The machine turns off and the lights come back on.) 
966,DOCTOR: Microthermistor. I doubt if she'll have a spare. 
967,BEYUS: She won't need one. You're going to put it back. Give it to me. 
968,(The Doctor and Beyus struggle for the component. Beyus gets it so the
969,Doctor dives for his umbrella and trips Beyus down the steps. Beyus
970,groans in pain as the Doctor retrieves the microthermistor.) 
971,DOCTOR: I had no intention of hurting you. 
972,RANI : Beyus! 
973,(The Doctor runs out the right hand exit as the Rani enters from the
974,Genius room.) 
975,RANI: Who sabotaged this? What happened? 
976,"BEYUS: Ah, my head. "
977,RANI: Was it the Doctor? 
978,BEYUS: I don't know. He tried to steal something from the cabinet. I
979,tried to stop him.

989,her. 
990,(The other Tetrap carries the rigid Mel away.

994,DOCTOR: Here's a turn up for the cook. A rock that talks. 
995,(Ikona shows himself.) 
996,"IKONA: You must be the Doctor. I've met your companion, Mel. "
997,DOCTOR: Don't hold that against me. 
998,"IKONA: Oh, I see where she gets her sense of humour. You're going to"
999,need it. 
1000,DOCTOR: That bad? 
1001,IKONA: Look down. 
1002,(The Doctor's toe is under a trip wire.) 
1003,"IKONA: Now step back, very slowly. "
1004,"(The Doctor obeys, and a Tetrap comes bounding up.) "
1005,DOCTOR: Hello. Haven't I seen you hanging around somewhere? 
1006,(Ikona fires his glitter gun before the Tetrap can use his net cannon.
1007,"The Doctor pushes the twirling bat away from him, and it steps onto the"
1008,trip wire. The Doctor watches in horror as it is trapped in a bubble
1009,which whirls away and explodes when it hits the top of the cliff. He
1010,removes his hat as a sign of respect.)

1016,(The Tetrap continues towards the lair entrance.) 
1017,RANI: Faroon? You can tell the Doctor he can have the girl in return
1018,for the microthermistor he stole. 
1019,FAROON: And where will I find this Doctor? 
1020,RANI: He'll make contact with the other Lakertyans and try to stir up
1021,"trouble, so don't be taken in by his glib tongue. "
1022,(The Rani goes into her laboratory.) 
1023,"BEYUS: Do as she says, Faroon. You know the penalty our people will"
1024,have to pay if you disobey. 
1025,FAROON: But shouldn't we try to escape as Sarn did? 
1026,"BEYUS: Faroon, I have obeyed all of the Rani's commands, carried out"
1027,the most menial of tasks. Now that she has almost completed the
1028,"experiment, why should I take the risk? "
1029,"FAROON: And when her work is finished, what happens then? "
1030,BEYUS: She will leave Lakertya. 
1031,"FAROON: Will she, Beyus? "
1032,BEYUS: That was her promise. 
1033,FAROON: And when she does? 
1034,BEYUS: Our lives will return to normal. 
1035,"FAROON: Normal, Beyus? Without Sarn? "
1036,"BEYUS: Faroon, deliver the message to the Doctor. I believe that you"
1037,will find him in the Centre of Leisure.

1042,stepping stones lit with torches and up to an entranceway cut into a
1043,cliff. Other Lakertyans are leaving.) 
1044,DOCTOR: No restrictions for movement. The Lakertyans can come and go
1045,"freely, then. "
1046,IKONA: Provided they obey the instructions of Beyus and don't try to
1047,get into the laboratory.

1057,IKONA: The Centre of Leisure. The Centre of Indolence. 
1058,"DOCTOR: Not a favourite haunt of yours, I take it, Ikona. "
1059,IKONA: No. I can't imagine why Beyus told you to come to this place. 
1060,DOCTOR: He said I'd find the answer to his subservience here. 
1061,IKONA: From these spineless pleasure seekers? 
1062,DOCTOR: Why not? 
1063,"IKONA: It would require effort, that's why, Doctor. They've become"
1064,spoon-fed drones. There's no need for them to strive. An indulgent
1065,"system provides all. Well, didn't Beyus give you any clue as to what to"
1066,look for? 
1067,"DOCTOR: He was too anxious for explanations. But whatever the threat,"
1068,it must be considerable. Do you see anything that's different? New? 
1069,IKONA: Only that. Another pointless embellishment. 
1070,(Ikona points at the disco ball.) 
1071,"DOCTOR: Hmm, I wonder. Couldn't we ask someone, you know, if "
1072,IKONA: We'll be interrupting their pleasure. 
1073,(They go to a couple in an alcove.) 
1074,IKONA: Could you tell me what that globe's for? 
1075,(They ignore him.) 
1076,IKONA: I did warn you. 
1077,DOCTOR: There's none so deaf as those that clutch at straws. 
1078,IKONA: If you say so. Lanisha! 
1079,(Ikona crosses the room to greet another male.) 
1080,LANISHA: Ikona. 
1081,IKONA: Lanisha. Can you tell me what that globe's for? 
1082,"LANISHA: We've been forbidden to have anything to do with you, Ikona. "

1091,URAK: Answer the mistress Rani! 
1092,BEYUS: They're from the fireworks that we used to have at our carnival.
1093,
1094,RANI: These were fired at no carnival. These were used to enable the
1095,Doctor to escape. 
1096,URAK: Causing the death of a Tetrap. 
1097,BEYUS: None of my followers would be responsible. 
1098,RANI: You're careful not deny it's the work of a Lakertyan. 
1099,"(The Rani turns on the table screen. It shows the disco ball, which"
1100,stops turning.) 
1101,BEYUS: You will be punishing the innocent.

1112,(Everyone runs up the stairs to the exit. Faroon arrives to see another
1113,person die.) 
1114,FAROON: Do you still insist that Beyus should not count the cost of
1115,"resistance, Ikona? If every cell in the globe were opened, there"
1116,wouldn't be a Lakertyan left alive. 
1117,"DOCTOR: Hmm, killer insects. "

1124,"flat area. Mel waves and the Doctor raises his hat, then hands the"
1125,microthermistor to Ikona. Ikona takes it and walks forward.) 
1126,DOCTOR: Let Mel come towards me. I've kept my side of the bargain.
1127,You've got what you want. 
1128,(Ikona puts the microthermistor on a boulder between them and gestures
1129,for Mel to walk forward. He follows her and takes the component.) 
1130,URAK: So stupid. You are not a worthy opponent for the Rani. 
1131,(Urak leaves. Ikona and Mel walk back to the Doctor.) 
1132,"DOCTOR: What's he crowing on about, Mel? "
1133,(Mel walks straight through the Doctor and vanishes.) 
1134,DOCTOR: A hologram! As substantial as the Rani's scruples.

1143,"RANI: I'm in danger of missing the solstice, which is far more"
1144,important. 
1145,BEYUS: The computer control needs constant monitoring. I can't manage
1146,alone. 
1147,"RANI: So I've anticipated, and I've got just the expert for you. "
1148,(Urak brings Mel in and puts her down. The Rani breaks a capsule under
1149,her nose and Mel wakes.) 
1150,"RANI: Beyus, she's your responsibility. "
1151,BEYUS: Mine? But I can't govern her. She's not a Lakertyan. 
1152,RANI: Just make certain she understands the penalty for
1153,non-cooperation.

1156,
1157, [Lakertya]

1159," IKONA: Doctor, in my opinion, returning to the"
1160,laboratory is a pointless exercise. I've a feeling Mel's beyond all
1161,help. 
1162,"DOCTOR: Oh, the Rani would never go to those extremes. She never does"
1163,anything without reason. 
1164,"IKONA: Well then, why the hologram? Why didn't she just release Mel? "
1165,DOCTOR: A bird in the hand keeps the Doctor away. 
1166,IKONA: You're probably right. 
1167,"DOCTOR: Only on this occasion, it'll have the opposite affect."

1171,(The Rani replaces the microthermistor. The lights
1172,dim and the machines come on. The lights under the staircase are

1174,RANI: The increase in brain activity is not enough. I'm going to miss
1175,the solstice. 
1176,URAK: Perhaps the stimulation of a greater genius. A brilliance that
1177,"surpasses all others, mistress. "
1178,RANI: Do I gather you're suggesting that I climb into one of those
1179,cabinets? 
1180,URAK: Your capable presence is wasted in here and I could operate the
1181,machine. 
1182,"RANI: Yes, I'm sure you could. Urak! Come with me. "
1183,(Urak picks up his web cannon and follows her.)

1186,
1187, RANI: Prepare the Doctor's cabinet for occupation.
1188,
1189,"MEL: Well, that'll be a waste of effort. You've got to find him first"
1190,and then catch him. 
1191,RANI: I need neither find nor catch him. The bumbling fool's ready made
1192,as a sacrificial lamb. 
1193,MEL: He's shrewder than you think. Underestimating the Doctor is a
1194,common fault. 
1195,RANI: Really? 
1196,MEL: He's got qualities you'll never have. 
1197,RANI: Such as? 
1198,MEL: Something I'd call humanity. 
1199,RANI: Huh. You're as sentimental as he is. Get on with your work. 
1200,(The Rani leaves.) 
1201,BEYUS: Don't antagonise her. She has only to press a button for every
1202,Lakertyan to be exterminated.

1207," DOCTOR: Hmm, a space rocket launcher, sure enough."
1208,But have you noticed it's got a fixed trajectory? 
1209,IKONA: No doubt it'll still play havoc with our planet. 
1210,"DOCTOR: Maybe as a side effect, Ikona, but not the intention. I'd say"
1211,"the target is the asteroid of strange matter, which means the launch is"
1212,locked into a precise time. 
1213,IKONA: Could it be the solstice? That's due. 
1214,"DOCTOR: Assuming it is, the Rani's overriding priority will be to meet"
1215,that countdown. No more setbacks or delays. I must go back to the
1216,"laboratory. That sealed chamber, I've got to get in there. Out of the"
1217,"frying pan into the mire. Right, Ikona, start the diversionary tactics."
1218,

1220,not fall for it again.

1355,MAN : Outrageous polemics. 
1356,"DOCTOR : Gentlemen, such hostility. Remember, blessed are the pie"
1357,makers for they shall make light pastry. 
1358,EINSTEIN: It is a fundamental postulate that all motion is relative. 
1359,DOCTOR : You wouldn't say that if you met my uncle. 
1360,MAN : Dismissing our position as decadent heresy is the refuge of
1361,the reactionary. 
1362,"DOCTOR : Ah well, every dogma has its day. "
1363,RANI: I'll kill him! 
1364,(The Rani runs out of the chamber.) 
1365,WOMAN : It is stated in the special theory and has been
1366,demonstrated that an increase in velocity will increase matter. 
1367,RANI: I'll kill him! 
1368,"DOCTOR : Exactly. The faster a fat man runs, the fatter he will"
1369,get. 
1370,"WOMAN : Well, of course"

1374," RANI: Quickly, disconnect the Doctor. The fool has provoked multiple schizophrenia. "
1375,(The Rani turns off the cabinet.) 
1376,MEL: Congratulations. You brought us here. 
1377,RANI: And I shall dispose of you. This will rid me of the pair of you. 
1378,"(While the Rani wrestles with her wrist computer, Mel opens the"
1379,Doctor's cabinet. The Doctor comes out and grabs The Rani from behind.)
1380,
1381,"DOCTOR: Quick, Mel, don't just stand there, help me! "
1382,"RANI: Let go of me, you interfering maniac. "
1383,(The Doctor and Mel push the Rani into the cabinet and close the door.)
1384,
1385,MEL: Give her a taste of her own medicine. Shall I switch on? 
1386,"DOCTOR: No, Mel. Two wrongs don't make a left turn. Right. "
1387,"(The Doctor runs out, followed by Mel.) "
1388,RANI: Let me out! Let me out! Do you hear me?
1389,
1390, [Brain chamber]
1391,
1392," MEL: Doctor, before this regeneration you were on"
1393,keen on cats and you know what curiosity did to them. 
1394,"DOCTOR: Leave the quotes to the expert, Mel. "
1395,(They go along a cat walk to the cliff wall under the launch platform.)
1396,
1397,DOCTOR: The rocket! It's a fixed trajectory. 
1398,MEL: It isn't all that will be fixed if we don't get out of here. 
1399,"DOCTOR: So, the target is the asteroid, which at any moment now will"
1400,reach the solstice and I'm sure that's the deadline. He who dares
1401,spins. 
1402,(They have returned to the main chamber. The Doctor activates some
1403,controls and a monitor lights up with an image of a big flash.) 
1404,DOCTOR: Whoops. A supernova.

1408, (The Tetraps enter and go down the stairs. Urak
1409,issues his orders from the balcony.) 
1410,URAK: Put those on the legs of all the Lakertyans. Disobey and I will
1411,release the killer insects from the globe. 
1412,(Ikona watches from a hiding place as a young male takes the box and
1413,hands out anklets.) 
1414,FAROON: Why are you doing this? We've cooperated. 
1415,"URAK: Silence, Lakertyan! There have been too many unfriendly acts. "
1416,FAROON: Not by us. This is unjust. At least tell us what they're for. 
1417,URAK: I will demonstrate with the greatest of pleasure. You! 
1418,(Urak points to a young female who is wearing an anklet. He pushes a
1419,"button on his wrist computer and the anklet explodes. Moments later,"
1420,the young woman is a skeleton.)

1432,(Urak orders the Tetraps to leave. Once they have
1433,"gone, Ikona goes over to Faroon.) "
1434,IKONA: I'll try and contact the Doctor. We need his help.
1435,
1436, [Brain chamber]
1437,
1438, DOCTOR: Do you realise how close the Rani must
1439,have taken her Tardis in order to record that? 
1440,MEL: All I realise is that we've seen what she intends to happen to
1441,Lakertya. Can she do it? 
1442,DOCTOR: Not by my reckoning. The only known detonator for exploding a
1443,strange matter asteroid is strange matter itself. 
1444,MEL: You said that strange matter was incredibly heavy. 
1445,DOCTOR: A lump the size of this brain would weigh as much as an entire
1446,planet. 
1447,"MEL: Well, could she be using the brain to come up with a formula "
1448,"DOCTOR: For a lightweight substitute. Could be, could be. "
1449,"MEL: Well then, haven't we come up with the answer? "
1450,DOCTOR: Not completely. What I can't fathom is why the Rani took such
1451,an incredible risk to record a supernova. 
1452,MEL: To discover how to reconstruct the same event. 
1453,"DOCTOR: No, more than that. She wouldn't be simply interested in a"
1454,"display of pyrotechnics. Too negative. No, there's a deeper motive and"
1455,the answer's in here. 
1456,(He hits his own head.) 
1457,"MEL: Well, calm down. Let's apply a bit of logic, shall we? What is it"
1458,that you can contribute that those other geniuses can't? 
1459,"DOCTOR: A knowledge of time. Oh, a great discovery. I worked that out"
1460,ages ago. 
1461,RANI: So now you know. 
1462,DOCTOR: Not the complete story. The last chapter's missing. Keeping
1463,"quiet, isn't it? "
1464,"RANI: Perhaps, unlike you, it only speaks when it has something"
1465,intelligent to say. 
1466,DOCTOR: Possibly. On the other hand it could be wondering why you want
1467,"helium two. That's why you want to explode strange matter, isn't it? To"
1468,reproduce helium two. 
1469,"RANI: The last chapter, Doctor. The denouement. "
1470,(She turns the wall screen on.) 
1471,"RANI: In the aftermath of the explosion, helium two will fuse with the"
1472,upper zones of the Lakertyan atmosphere to form a shell of chronons. I
1473,"don't have to tell you what chronons are, do I, Doctor? "
1474,DOCTOR: Indeed you don't. (to Mel) Discrete particles of time. 
1475,"RANI: In the same millisecond that chronon shell is being formed, the"
1476,hothouse effect of the gamma rays will cause the primate functions of
1477,"the brain to go into chain reaction, multiplying until the gap between"
1478,shell and planet is filled. 
1479,DOCTOR: A time manipulator. You're going to change this planet into a
1480,time manipulator. 
1481,RANI: A cerebral mass capable of dominating and controlling time
1482,anywhere in the cosmos. 
1483,DOCTOR: I don't believe it. A time manip. This monstrosity will give
1484,you the ability to change the order of creation. 
1485,RANI: Creation's chaotic. I shall introduce order. Wherever evolution
1486,"has taken the wrong route, I shall redirect it. That planet you're so"
1487,"obsessed with, Earth, I shall return to the Cretaceous age. MEL: The"
1488,cretaceous age? 
1489,RANI: The potential of the dinosaurs was never fully realised. 
1490,"DOCTOR: That means Shakespeare, Michelangelo, Louis Pasteur, Elvis,"
1491,even Mrs Malaprop will never have existed.

1495, (Urak has returned.) 
1496,RANI : Your concern for these minions is pathetic. They're an
1497,inferior species. 
1498,DOCTOR : Thrust into the oblivion. 
1499,RANI: Why not? 
1500,DOCTOR : The same with Lakertya. All life on this planet will
1501,become extinct. 
1502,RANI : An unfortunate side effect. 
1503,DOCTOR : All living creatures left behind exterminated. 
1504,"RANI : Of which you, Doctor, will be one. "

1510,subsided. 
1511,DOCTOR: Before I thought you were a psychopath without murderous
1512,intent. I withdraw the qualification. 
1513,BRAIN: Eighty seven K to the power of nineteen E correlated with fifty
1514,two to the power of six point four equals twenty nine V
1515,DOCTOR: Thirty nine. (He realises what he has said and bites his fist and slaps the back of his hand.)
1516,BRAIN: Correction is noted. Thirty nine V plus W. Eureka! Objective
1517,achieved. Loyhargil.

1528,grabs the net cannon and fires it over the Tetrap and he collapses.)

1554,"these bangles, they can't help. "
1555,DOCTOR: Hmm. 
1556,(The Doctor examines Faroon's anklet.) 
1557,DOCTOR: You've got to give the Rani full marks for ingenuity. 
1558,IKONA: Perhaps if we're careful we can cut them. 
1559,"MEL: Oh, that's a daft idea. They're bound to be booby trapped. "
1560,"DOCTOR: Less of the pessimism, Mel. Not all the cards are in the Rani's"
1561,flavour. 
1562,(The Doctor uses a penknife to remove the cover from the anklet's
1563,control circuit.) 
1564,"DOCTOR: Now, if we were to run a wire from here round to here, then the"
1565,circuit wouldn't be broken when the bangle was open. Mel. You're the
1566,computer expert. How about it? 
1567,MEL: Where am I going to find the right sort of wire? 
1568,"(The Doctor searches his pockets, but Ikona pulls a handful of"
1569,filaments from an ornamental fibre optic light.) 
1570,"IKONA: Where there's a will, there's a "
1571,"DOCTOR: Beneficiary. Good thinking, Ikona. "
1572,"(Mel uses the filament to create the bypass, and removes Faroon's"
1573,anklet.) 
1574,"DOCTOR: Well done, Mel. Ikona, I'm relying on you to help the"
1575,Lakertyans help themselves for once. Remove the bangles. 
1576,IKONA: Right. 
1577,"FAROON: Doctor, haven't you overlooked something? If the Rani releases"
1578,"the insects, we'll all be dead. "
