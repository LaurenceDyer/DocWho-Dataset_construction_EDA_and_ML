20,  [Salvage
21,ship] 
22, (Van Baalan Bros salvage ship A89//0989 is
23,powering its way through space. Clue - a photograph of three men has
24,one side torn off. Two men are asleep in their bunks whilst a third -
25,not in the photograph - is cleaning parts. He has a barcode on his neck
26,and bionic eyes. The computer beeps.) 
27,COMPUTER: Incoming salvage. Please validate. Incoming salvage. Please
28,validate. Incoming salvage. Please validate. 
29,(The taller of the two men gets up.) 
30,BRAM: Rusty garbage. It's not worth lacing up my boots. 
31,TRICKY: Wasting our time. There's no salvage this far out. 
32,"BRAM: You're a lucky boy, Tricky. You're an android. You don't get"
33,bored. 
34,(They look across at another man still in his bunk.) 
35,TRICKY: He won't turn back. Not with half a cargo. 
36,BRAM: He's not captain. We're equal partners. 
37,TRICKY: Yeah. Right. 
38, [Tardis] 
39, DOCTOR: You said 
40,CLARA: I know what I said. I was the one who said it. 
41,DOCTOR: You said it was looking at you funny. 
42,"CLARA: I was tired, overwrought. I didn't mean it. It's an appliance."
43,It does a job. 
44,DOCTOR: It's a pretty cool appliance. We're not talking cheese grater
45,here. 
46,CLARA: You're not getting me to talk to your ship. That's properly
47,bonkers. 
48,"DOCTOR: (to console) It's okay, it's okay. "
49,CLARA: You're like one of those guys who can't go out with a girl
50,unless his mother approves. 
51,DOCTOR: It's important to me you get along. I could leave you two alone
52,together. 
53,CLARA: Now you're creeping me out. 
54,DOCTOR: Take the wheel. Not the wheel. I'll make it easy. Shut it down
55,to basic mode for you. 
56,CLARA: Basic? Because I'm a girl? 
57,DOCTOR: No. 
58,(And turns a key labelled 'Smiths'. 
59, [Salvage ship] 
60, GREGOR: Everyone suit up. It's good salvage. I can
61,smell it. 
62,(Their radar has picked up the Tardis.) 
63,BRAM: It's just trash. 
64,"TRICKY: No, look. There's something tasty in the magno-field. "
65,COMPUTER: Magno-grab ready. Engaging. 
66,(The cargo doors open wide like jaws.) 
67,GREGOR: Move yourself. 
68,"(They get dressed - heavy boots, overalls, and a small grenade-like"
69,device. A blue energy beam shoots out and grabs the Tardis whilst loud
70,music plays.) 
71, [Tardis] 
72, (And the power goes out just as Clara operates a
73,control.) 
74,CLARA: What have I done? 
75,"DOCTOR: Er, okay. "
76,CLARA: Doctor? 
77,DOCTOR: All the electrical impulses are jammed. I can't get the shields
78,back up. She's completely vulnerable. 
79,CLARA: I swear I just touched it. 
80,(The Doctor manages to push up a breaker lever and there is a big
81,bang.) 
82,"DOCTOR: Magnetic hobble-field. We're flying right into it. Clara, stay"
83,by me. 
84,CLARA: Please tell me there's a button you can press to fix this. 
85,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Big friendly button. "
86,CLARA: You're lying. 
87,DOCTOR: Yep. 
88,CLARA: To stop me freaking out? 
89,DOCTOR: Is it working? 
90,CLARA: Not so much. 
91,(The grenade device rolls along the floor. Clara picks it up and it
92,burns her hand. She drops it again. Bang!) 
93, [Salvage ship] 
94, (Huge sets of pincers pass the Tardis along inside
95,the ship.) 
96,"TRICKY: What is it, some kind of escape pod? "
97,GREGOR: Come on. 
98,(The Tardis has been dumped onto a pile of cables and is lying at 45
99,degrees.) 
100,GREGOR: Crack it open. 
101,(Gregor runs forward with a large hammer. That has no effect. Next
102,comes the focused laser cutter.) 
103,BRAM: It's doing nothing. 
104,GREGOR: Use the thermo-charge and blast it. 
105,"TRICKY: No, no, no, wait. It's like she's alive. She's, she's"
106,suffering. I can feel it. I can feel it. 
107,That's just robot rant. 
108,"BRAM: No, Gregor, he's right. Looks like there's a broken fuel line. "
109,(Steam is coming out of the top of the Tardis.) 
110,"GREGOR: All right. All right, put it back. No salvage today, boys. Open"
111,the bay doors. 
112,TRICKY: Wait. 
113,(Tricky's bionic eye zooms in on a boot sticking out of the cables
114,under the Tardis.) 
115,TRICKY: Somebody's under that thing. The crew were still on board when
116,we dragged her in. 
117,"GREGOR: We did nothing. If anyone asks, that ship was already busted."
118,"You got that? And you, make sure you keep your oily mouth shut, right? "
119,"DOCTOR: It's rude to whisper. Hi. I'm the Doctor. And you are? Er, Van"
120,Baalen and Van Baalen. Van Baalen and Van Baalen. That's going to get
121,confusing later. 
122,GREGOR: We found you drifting. 
123,"BRAM: Yeah, your ship was junked up pretty bad. "
124,DOCTOR: What broke my ship was a magno-grab. Found this remote in your
125,"pocket. Eh? What are the chances? Outlawed in most galaxies, this"
126,little beastie can disable whole vessels unless you have shield
127,"oscillators, which I turned off so that Clara could fly, damn it."
128,"Clara. Where is she? Girl, about so high. Feisty. She's still on board."
129,
130,"TRICKY: No, wait. Your pod is leaking fuel. If she's still in here,"
131,she's dead. 
132,"DOCTOR: Ah, respirators. "
133,"GREGOR: We can open the doors for a split second, reach in and grab"
134,her. 
135,"DOCTOR: Trust me, we can't. Now please, help me get her out. "
136,"TRICKY: I'm telling you, she fried "
137,"GREGOR: Shut it, tin mouth. What sort of fee are we talking? "
138,"DOCTOR: If you help me get her out, you get the machine, all the scrap,"
139,eh? 
140,BRAM: It's not worth the risk. Four feet of metal? Nah. 
141,DOCTOR: What if I can guarantee you the best haul you've ever had? 
142,"GREGOR: Bram, open the bay doors. "
143,"DOCTOR: No, no. Please, stop. Listen, listen. Right behind those doors"
144,is the salvage of a lifetime. 
145, [Corridor] 
146," (Inside the Tardis, the Cloister bell is tolling."
147,Clara wakes up under an ornate but light piece of rubble.) 
148,CLARA: Doctor? Doctor? 
149,(She blows on her burnt palm and walks along to a bulkhead door.) 
150,CLARA: Red flashing light means something bad. Get out of here fast? Or
151,"possibly, whatever you do, don't open this door. "
152,(So she opens the door. There is an explosion.) 
153,CLARA: Bad decision. 
154,(She runs from the fireball and closes the next bulkhead door she
155,"finds. There are deep claw marks in the wall nearby, and something"
156,growls.) 
157, [Salvage ship] 
158," BRAM: Hey, are we really going to risk it? That"
159,thing is spewing poison. We should blow it back into space. 
160,GREGOR: Get your gear. 
161,"BRAM: Hey, I don't take orders from my kid brother. "
162,"GREGOR: Don't try and form sentences, all right? Stick to what you do"
163,best. 
164,"DOCTOR: Tell me, since when does an android need a blast suit and a"
165,respirator? 
166,"BRAM: Flesh coating, same as us. He'd burn up. "
167,"TRICKY: No fear, no hate, no pain. "
168,(The Doctor unlocks the Tardis.) 
169,GREGOR: Salvage of a lifetime? 
170,DOCTOR: I feel pretty confident I can deliver on that. Here we go. 
171, [Tardis] 
172, GREGOR: I don't get it. I thought she was lying on
173,her side. 
174,DOCTOR: The Tardis is special. She has her own gravity. I'd explain if
175,I had some charts and a board pen. 
176,"GREGOR: It's, it's, it's bigger "
177,"DOCTOR: On the inside. Do you know, I get that a lot. "
178,TRICKY: Whoa. Awesome. 
179,DOCTOR: Well put. Whoa and awesome. 
180,(The Doctor vents the fumes from the console room.) 
181,DOCTOR: Safe to breathe. 
182,(They all remove the respirators. The Doctor scans with the sonic
183,screwdriver.) 
184,"DOCTOR: Okay, now, the last thing I remember, you were right there."
185,"Come on, Clara, talk to me. "
186,BRAM: How big is this baby? 
187,DOCTOR: Picture the biggest ship you've ever seen. Are you picturing
188,it? 
189,BRAM: Yeah. 
190,"DOCTOR: Good. Now forget it, because this ship is infinite. "
191,GREGOR: It could take you hours to find the girl. 
192,DOCTOR: Days. Plus this whole place is toxic. She could be dead by the
193,"time I reach her. So, here's the mission. We're going to find her in"
194,one hour. 
195,GREGOR: We? 
196,DOCTOR: You're my guys for this. 
197,GREGOR: That wasn't the deal. 
198,DOCTOR: 'Tis now. 
199,BRAM: What makes you think we'll help? 
200,(A countdown clock starts on the scanner.) 
201,DOCTOR: I just activated the Tardis self-destruct system. One hour
202,until this ship blows. 
203,"(Bram runs for the door, which slams in his face.) "
204,DOCTOR: Don't try to leave. The Tardis is in lockdown. I'll open those
205,doors when Clara's by my side. 
206,BRAM: You crazy lunatic! 
207,"DOCTOR: My ship, my rules. "
208,GREGOR: You'll kill us all. And the girl. 
209,DOCTOR: She's going to die if you don't help me. Don't get into a
210,"spaceship with a madman. Didn't anyone ever teach you that? Okay, a"
211,little gently persuasion. Say thirty minutes. 
212,(The countdown jumps to 29:59:10.) 
213,BRAM: She'll die even quicker now! 
214,DOCTOR: We all perform better under pressure. Anybody want to go for
215,fifteen minutes? 
216,BRAM: Whoa! 
217,GREGOR: Whoa! 
218,DOCTOR: It's your own time you're wasting. Salvage of a lifetime. You
219,meant the ship. I meant Clara. 
220, [Storeroom] 
221, (Clara finds an old-fashioned room with a stone
222,"arched door, and the Doctor's cradle. She takes down a model of the"
223,Tardis from a shelf. Someone or something else is there with her. Clara
224,spots it as she picks up a black umbrella.) 
225,CLARA: Oh! 
226,(And runs out.) 
227, [Corridor] 
228," (Gregor hangs back from the Doctor, Tricky and"
229,Bram.) 
230,GREGOR: Report. What's on board this thing? 
231,"COMPUTER: Dynomorphic generators, conceptual geometer, beam"
232,"synthesiser, orthogonal engine filters. "
233,(He catches the others up.) 
234,"GREGOR: Guys, guys, look, I think we should split up. It's our best"
235,chance of finding the girl. You know it is. 
236,DOCTOR: Don't touch a thing. The Tardis will get huffy if you mess. 
237,"GREGOR: Keep in radio contact, all right? "
238,(Tricky nods and goes off with the Doctor.) 
239,GREGOR: Get back to the console. Strip it apart. 
240,BRAM: Okay. 
241,GREGOR: All right? 
242,"(They split up. Meanwhile, Clara is running from the growling biped,"
243,past an observatory with lovely big Victorian telescope and an open air
244,swimming pool into -) 
245, [Library] 
246, (Letters are starting to appear on her burnt palm.
247,This library has both shelves of books and shelves of bottles. Six
248,stories of them. 
249,CLARA: Now that's just showing off. 
250, [Tardis] 
251, (Bram prises off a section of the console.) 
252,SUSAN : I made up the name Tardis from the initials Time And
253,Relative Dimension In Space. 
254,DOCTOR 3 : The Tardis is dimensionally transcendental. 
255,JO: : What does that mean? 
256,DOCTOR 4 : That's trans-dimensional engineering. A key Time Lord
257,discovery. 
258,DOCTOR 9 : The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get
259,"through that door. Believe me, they've tried. "
260,AMY : We are in space! 
261,IAN : It can move anywhere in time and space? 
262,(And other indistinct phrases.) 
263, [Corridor] 
264, (Gregor is following the beeps on his scanner.) 
265,COMPUTER: Everything. 
266,GREGOR: What? Report. 
267,"COMPUTER: Everything, behind that door. "
268,GREGOR: Everything? 
269,COMPUTER: Sensor detects everything you could possibly want. 
270, [ARS room] 
271," (Of course, he goes in. There are lots of cables"
272,"dangling down, with large glowing bulbs on the end.) "
273,COMPUTER: Everything. 
274,GREGOR: I don't understand. Give me a price tag. 
275,COMPUTER: Incalculable. 
276,GREGOR: What? 
277,COMPUTER: More valuable than the total sum of any currency. Living
278,"metal. Bespoke engineering. Whatever machine you require, this system"
279,will build it. 
280,(Gregor raises the focused laser cutter to take some. The Doctor and
281,Tricky run in.) 
282,"DOCTOR: No! No, no, stop! Please, don't. Don't touch it. Please. She"
283,won't let you touch it. I can feel a Tardis tantrum coming on. 
284,GREGOR: What the hell is this place? 
285,DOCTOR: Architectural Reconfiguration System. It reconstructs particles
286,according to your needs. 
287,GREGOR: A machine that makes machines? 
288,"DOCTOR: Yes, basically. What are you doing? No, no, don't. Don't! "
289,(Gregor takes hold of one of the Gallifreyan engraved light bulbs.) 
290,"DOCTOR: If you walk out of here with that circuit, the Tardis will try"
291,"to stop you. Now listen to me. Look, the clock is ticking. We must find"
292,Clara. 
293,(Gregor pulls off the light bulb and the whole ship roars.) 
294,GREGOR: What the? Where's the door gone? 
295,DOCTOR: Ever seen a spaceship get ugly? 
296,GREGOR: This isn't happening. 
297,DOCTOR: She won't relinquish it. Her basic genetic material. 
298,"GREGOR: Torch it. I said, torch it. "
299,"TRICKY: Can't you feel it, Gregor? The ship, the ship's in torment,"
300,like it's a living thing. You can't hurt it. 
301,"(Gregor puts the light bulb in his backpack, and the door returns.) "
302,"GREGOR: What's the matter, Tardis? Scared to fight me? "
303, [Library] 
304, (Clara finds a large bound book on its own special
305,stand - The History of the Time War. She opens it in the middle and
306,does a little reading.) 
307,CLARA: So that's who 
308,"(Clang, growl. She dodges behind another rack of books and bottle to"
309,hide from the thing. Above her are bottles containing the Encyclopedia
310,Gallifreyica. We can hear muffled voices. Clara presses back against
311,"the rack, one of the bottles tips over, and the words tumble out over"
312,her head. She wafts them away so the creature cannot hear. It gets
313,close and she runs for the entrance.) 
314, [Junction] 
315, TRICKY: It's the same. It's just the same. 
316,"DOCTOR: It's diverting us, spinning a maze around us. We will never"
317,reach Clara in time. 
318,"(Gregor walks away, and they follow.) "
319,DOCTOR: Hey! Hey! 
320,(And return from the opposite direction.) 
321,"TRICKY: It's just the same, again. "
322,DOCTOR: No point in building walls. You'll just know how to smash them
323,"down. It's found other ways of controlling you. Smart bunch, Time"
324,"Lords. No dress sense, dreadful hats, but smart. If you want to get out"
325,"of here, let that circuit go. It is creating a labyrinth. "
326,"GREGOR: Bram? Bram, can you hear me? "
327, [Under the console room] 
328," GREGOR : Bram, the ship is alive. Get out of"
329,"there. Bram, don't touch anything. "
330,BRAM: You're just the sweetest thing ever. 
331, [Console room] 
332," CLARA: Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank"
333,"you, thank you. "
334,(She kisses the console.) 
335,CLARA: No! The door. Where's the door gone? No. You can't do this. 
336, [Under the console room] 
337, (Bram is following glowing power cables further
338,and further down.) 
339,GREGOR : Bram? You've got to get out of there fast. 
340,"(The cables touch Bram, and he falls. Once he has got up and dusted"
341,"himself off, something attacks him. Screams and twitches, then he is"
342,still.) 
343, [Junction] 
344, GREGOR: Channel's dead. 
345,"TRICKY: We've got to help him. Gregor, do something. Do something! "
346,"GREGOR: It's too late, he's gone. Let's just worry about the salvage. "
347,TRICKY: You care more about that circuit than you do about him. 
348,DOCTOR: Your concern for your brother is really touching. The android
349,is more cut up about it that you. Now will you two stop bickering and
350,listen. There is something else down there. 
351,"TRICKY: We've got to get out of here. Gregor, give it back. Give it"
352,back to her. 
353,(Tricky takes the light bulb from Gregor's pack.) 
354,GREGOR: What are you doing? You're always on the side of the machines. 
355,DOCTOR: Fellas! Multiple lifeforms on board the Tardis with us. I am
356,getting a massive signal. 
357,TRICKY: Where are they? 
358,"DOCTOR: Oh, you're not going to like the answer. About two steps away."
359,One step. 
360,(Behind them. A strange conjoined twins creature attacks.) 
361,"DOCTOR: Gregor, look out! Careful! Gregor, no! We have to stay"
362,"together. Come on, run. Tricky, run. I'm sorry. "
363, [Console room] 
364, (Clara discovers there is more than one console
365,"room, each at the end of a corridor.) "
366,"CLARA: Oh, why are you doing this? "
367, [Console room 2] 
368, TRICKY: Back where we started. 
369,"DOCTOR: No, it's an echo. The console room is the safest place on the"
370,ship. It can replicate itself any number of times. It's trying to
371,protect us. 
372,TRICKY: Because I tried to give back the circuit? 
373,DOCTOR: Team Tardis. 
374,(The Doctor rummages in the wreck of the console. A piece of metal
375,"falls, and lands in Clara's console room.) "
376,"TRICKY: Where did, where did that go? "
377,"DOCTOR: There's more than one echo room. Hey, look, look. The Tardis"
378,"has got Clara safe. That was her. That was her there. Thank you, thank"
379,"you, thank you. "
380,TRICKY: Why can't we see her? 
381,"DOCTOR: It's like a light switch. Two positions, flickering at"
382,super-infinite speeds. We're only together for a brief second. Shush. 
383,(They can hear Clara panting.) 
384,DOCTOR: I can hear her. 
385,(Clara opens an internal door. The creature is behind it. She screams.
386,The Doctor and Tricky can hear the growling.) 
387,TRICKY: She's let it in. She's let it in! 
388,"DOCTOR: If I can just isolate her position, I can nudge the"
389,"alternation, reach in and grab her. "
390, [Console room] 
391, (Dodging around the console.) 
392,CLARA: Who are you? 
393, [Console room 2] 
394," COMPUTER: Console room, echo imprint of the"
395,original. 
396,GREGOR: You're coming with me. I need you to get me out of here. 
397,(The Doctor sonicks Gregor's hand computer.) 
398,COMPUTER: Scanning for female human. Scanning for female human.
399,Unidentified human. 
400,DOCTOR: It doesn't know Lancashire. 
401,GREGOR: What? 
402,DOCTOR: It doesn't know sass. Yes! It's found Clara. It's found her.
403,She is right there. 
404,"(Clara screams, and partially appears. The Doctor grabs her and drags"
405,her through.) 
406,"DOCTOR: It's all right. Clara, I'm so, so sorry. Sorry. Please, please"
407,"forgive me, Clara. "
408,(Clara hits him.) 
409,"DOCTOR: Ow! Okay, so we're not doing hugging. I get that now. "
410,CLARA: What do you keep in here? Why have you got zombie creatures?
411,Good guys do not have zombie creatures. Rule one basic storytelling. 
412,DOCTOR: Not in front of the guests. 
413,CLARA: Who are they? 
414,"DOCTOR: Friends. Well, people who aren't trying to kill us, so I don't"
415,need punching again. 
416,"GREGOR: All right, all right. Look, a deal's a deal. You got the girl"
417,back. Now cancel the self-destruct. 
418,"DOCTOR: Ah. Ah. You know, I've got to tell you, I won't be needing you"
419,in my quiz team. 
420,GREGOR: What? 
421,"DOCTOR: There is no self-destruct. Hey? Hey? Hey? Had you going though,"
422,"boys, didn't I? I just wiggled a few buttons. Yeah, the old wiggly"
423,button trick. And the face. You've got to do the face. Save her or we
424,"all die. I though I rushed it a bit, but "
425,TRICKY: So you're telling us we're safe? 
426,DOCTOR: Ish. Apart from the monsters and the Tardis reinventing the
427,"architecture every five minutes. Guys, don't worry. The countdown's a"
428,"fake. Look, just give me a second. I'll turn it off. I only made it"
429,look as though the engine was actually exploding. 
430,(Eye of Harmony. Engine status: Overload.) 
431,"DOCTOR: Ah. That's not good. Okay, don't panic. Or maybe panic. "
432,CLARA: Something you want to share with the rest of us? 
433,"DOCTOR: It appears the engine is damaged. We're in trouble, Clara."
434,Proper trouble. It needs fixing or we're toast. 
435,"CLARA: So now would be a good time to use that big friendly button,"
436,right? 
437,"DOCTOR: Yes. Sorry, I should have had one built in. "
438,TRICKY: Where are we going? 
439,DOCTOR: Detour. 
440,(They run down the stairs and the Doctor sonicks open a hexagonal
441,panel.) 
442,DOCTOR: The centre of the Tardis. 
443, [Corridor] 
444, (The Doctor is scanning as he leads the troop.
445,Something flashes across the corridor.) 
446,CLARA: Shush. Something's in here. 
447,"TRICKY: Those things, they've followed us. "
448,"CLARA: Doctor, what are they? What aren't you telling me? "
449,DOCTOR: Trust me. Some things you don't want to know. 
450,(Something crosses behind them.) 
451,GREGOR: They're on the move again. 
452,"DOCTOR: Run. Move, move. "
453,(Clara gets separated from the men.) 
454,CLARA: Doctor? Doctor? Again. 
455,(The burn on her hand is becoming clearer - mirror writing.) 
456,CLARA 2: I know what I said. I was the one who said it. 
457,DOCTOR : You said it was looking at you funny. 
458,CLARA 2: Now you're creeping me out. Please tell me there is a button
459,you can press to fix this? 
460,(Present time Clara goes round the corner and sees the Doctor.) 
461,"CLARA: Oh, thank god. Doctor, what's going on? Say something. "
462,(The now Doctor comes up behind her.) 
463,"DOCTOR: Clara, stop. Don't touch it. There's a rupture in time"
464,somewhere on board the ship. A small tear in the fabric of the
465,continuum. It must have happened when the Tardis was pulled in by the
466,salvage vessel. The Tardis is leaking. 
467,CLARA: Leaking what? 
468,(He leads her along the corridors.) 
469,"DOCTOR: The past. You and me. Everything we've done, everything we've"
470,said. Recent history. It's not real. It's a memory. 
471,(They come across the single bodied glowing red eyed creature.) 
472,CLARA: What about this? 
473,"DOCTOR: If you're giving me the option, I'd say this one's real. "
474,(They run away. It chases them.) 
475,DOCTOR: She's right on to us. 
476,CLARA: She? 
477,"DOCTOR: Clara, don't ask me any more. "
478,CLARA 2: You're like one of those guys who can't go out with a girl
479,unless his mother approves. 
480,DOCTOR : It's important to me you get along. 
481,(The creature follows the echo people. There is a banging sound.) 
482,CLARA: What's that noise? 
483,DOCTOR: We're right under the primary fuel cells. 
484,"CLARA: So? So, so what? "
485,"DOCTOR: So, so the fuel's spilled out, so the rods will be exposed."
486,Means they'll cool 
487,CLARA: And start to warp. 
488,DOCTOR: And start to warp. Maybe even 
489,"CLARA: No, you don't say it. Don't you dare say it. "
490,DOCTOR: Maybe even break apart. 
491,(A rod flies through the walls just in front of them.) 
492,CLARA: Run? 
493,DOCTOR: I'm liking how you're thinking. 
494,CLARA: Yeah. 
495,(They run as more rods pierce the corridors from different angles. Up
496,"ahead, someone screams. Tricky has been speared by a rod through his"
497,shoulder.) 
498,TRICKY: Cut it off. Just cut my arm off. 
499,GREGOR: No. 
500,"TRICKY: It's the quickest way to release me. No fear, no hate, no pain."
501,I can get a new one. Disposable parts. Just do it. It won't hurt me. 
502,"GREGOR: Tricky, you just don't understand. "
503,TRICKY: I'm an android. Cut me! 
504,CLARA: You made it through. 
505,TRICKY: What's the matter with you? Why won't you cut me? 
506,DOCTOR: Tell him. 
507,TRICKY: Tell me what? 
508,"DOCTOR: You can't, can you. You're a coward. You won't save him, but"
509,you're scared to tell him why. 
510,TRICKY: What's he going on about? 
511,DOCTOR: Robots don't need blast suits. They don't need respirators.
512,They don't get frightened of monsters in the dark. 
513,TRICKY: What's he talking about? 
514,"DOCTOR: Two bionic eyes and a synthetic voice box. But you, my friend,"
515,are human. Flesh and blood. 
516,GREGOR: It was a joke. 
517,TRICKY: What? 
518,GREGOR: It was just a stupid joke. We did it to relieve the boredom. 
519,"DOCTOR: Well, it was very funny. They lied to you. Changed your"
520,identity just to provide some in-flight entertainment. 
521,"GREGOR: I'm sorry. You're human, Tricky. "
522,DOCTOR: Cut the metal. Cut the metal! Go! 
523, [Outside the Eye of Harmony] 
524, GREGOR: Where are we? 
525,"DOCTOR: Power source. Right, you lot, wait here. I'll check it's safe."
526,We can only survive for a minute or two in there. 
527,"CLARA: Er, what happens if we stay longer? "
528,DOCTOR: Our cells with liquefy and our skin will start to burn. 
529,CLARA: I always feel so good after we've spoken. 
530,DOCTOR: Marvellous. Keep this door shut. 
531,CLARA: That will not be a problem. 
532,(The Doctor enters the room. Gregor scans Clara.) 
533,COMPUTER: Lancashire. Sass. 
534,GREGOR: Intelligent sensor. 
535,"TRICKY: Ever pointed that thing at yourself, Gregor? What would it see?"
536,What sort of person does this to another human? Made them believe
537,they're made of metal. Who am I? 
538,(Gregor rips a patch off his suit. Van Baalen Bros. The Doctor runs
539,through the engine room and pulls open a door on the other side.) 
540,GREGOR: My mouthy little kid brother. 
541,"TRICKY: Why, why can't I remember? "
542,GREGOR: It was a salvage accident. There was a big explosion. You lost
543,"your sight, voice and your memory. "
544,"TRICKY: And you, you thought of a way you could have some fun with me?"
545,I just wanted a brother beside me! 
546,"GREGOR: You were always the smart one, Tricky. He wanted you to take"
547,over. He made you captain. 
548,TRICKY: He? 
549,GREGOR: Dad. 
550,TRICKY: I don't remember him. You did this to me just to be captain of
551,a heap of junk. 
552,(Tricky attacks Gregor.) 
553,"DOCTOR: Stop! Tricky, listen to me. Ask yourself why he couldn't cut"
554,"you up. He has just one tiny scrap of decency left in him, and you"
555,"helped him find that, okay? Now you. Don't ever forget this. "
556, [Eye of Harmony] 
557, (Very orange atmosphere.) 
558,"DOCTOR: Okay, move, move, move. "
559,(They all run onto the catwalk.) 
560,DOCTOR: The Eye of Harmony. Exploding star in the act of becoming a
561,"black hole. Time Lord engineering. You rip the star from its orbit,"
562,"suspend it in a permanent state of decay. This way, quickly. "
563,(But there is a creature behind the other door. And the female is at
564,the one they have just come through.) 
565,GREGOR: There's no way out. We're trapped. 
566,"CLARA: You're going to tell me right now. If we're going to die here,"
567,you're going to tell me what they are. 
568,DOCTOR: I can't. 
569,CLARA: Tell me. What's the use in secrets now? 
570,DOCTOR: Secrets protect us. Secrets make us safe. 
571,CLARA: We're not safe! 
572,COMPUTER: Sensor detects animal DNA. Human core element. Calculating
573,data. Calculating data. 
574,"DOCTOR: No, no, turn it off! "
575,COMPUTER: Lancashire. Sass. Identifiable substance. Clara. 
576,CLARA: That's me. 
577,DOCTOR: I'm so sorry. 
578,CLARA: It's me. I burn in here. 
579,DOCTOR: It isn't just the past leaking out through the time rift. It's
580,"the future. Listen, I brought you here to keep you safe, but it"
581,happened again. You died again. 
582,"CLARA: What do you mean, again? "
583,(Tricky and Gregor are trying to keep the door closed against another
584,creature.) 
585,"DOCTOR: Hang on. As long as we can interrupt the timeline, this can't"
586,"happen. Don't touch each other, otherwise the future will reassert"
587,itself. 
588,"(He pulls them back, and the creature breaks in. It claws at Gregor's"
589,backpack with the light bulb in it.) 
590,"DOCTOR: Gregor, Gregor, let go of the circuit. "
591,TRICKY: Just let it go. 
592,"DOCTOR: Gregor, Gregor. "
593,(Tricky knocks this creature off the catwalk. Presumably it is future
594,"burnt Doctor or maybe Bram, although he is already dead. Then the"
595,conjoined creature and burnt Clara break in.) 
596,"DOCTOR: Okay. Er, er "
597,"(Tricky attacks the conjoined creature, kicking it off the catwalk. He"
598,is left dangling.) 
599,GREGOR: Tricky! 
600,CLARA: Doctor? 
601,"DOCTOR: No, don't touch him, or time will reassert itself. "
602,(Gregor pulls Tricky up onto the catwalk and they change into the
603,conjoined creature. The Doctor and Clara get out just in time.) 
604, [Engine room] 
605, DOCTOR: The engine room. The heart of the Tardis. 
606,(They run forward to the edge of a cliff.) 
607,CLARA: We're outside. 
608,"DOCTOR: No, we're still in the Tardis. "
609,CLARA: There's no way across. 
610,"DOCTOR: No, okay, you're right. "
611,CLARA: So what do we do? Time for a plan. Do you have a plan? 
612,"DOCTOR: Well, no. No plan. Sorry. "
613,"CLARA: If you don't have a plan, we're dead. "
614,"DOCTOR: Yes, we are. So just tell me. "
615,CLARA: Tell you what? 
616,"DOCTOR: Well, there's no point now. We're about to die. Just tell me"
617,who you are. 
618,CLARA: You know who I am. 
619,"DOCTOR: No, I don't. I look at you every single day and I don't"
620,understand a thing about you. Why do I keep running into you? 
621,"CLARA: Doctor, you invited me. You said "
622,DOCTOR: Before that. I met you in the Dalek Asylum. There was a girl in
623,"a shipwreck and she died saving my life, and she was you. "
624,CLARA: She really wasn't. 
625,DOCTOR: Victorian London. There was a governess who was really a
626,"barmaid, and we fought the Great Intelligence together. She died and it"
627,"was my fault, and she was you. "
628,CLARA: You're scaring me. 
629,"DOCTOR: What are you, eh? Are you a trick, a trap? "
630,CLARA: I don't know what you're talking about! 
631,(And nearly steps back off the edge of the cliff. The Doctor grabs her
632,and holds her tight in his arms.) 
633,"DOCTOR: You really don't, do you. "
634,CLARA: I think I'm more scared of you right now than anything else on
635,that Tardis. 
636,"DOCTOR: You're just Clara, aren't you. "
637,(Another hug.) 
638,"CLARA: Okay, I don't know what the hell this is about, but the hug is"
639,really nice. 
640,DOCTOR: We're not going to die here. This isn't real! It's a snarl. 
641,CLARA: What? 
642,DOCTOR: What does a wounded animal do? It tries to scare everyone away.
643,"We're close to the engine. The Tardis is snarling at us, trying to"
644,frighten us off. We need to jump. 
645,CLARA: You're insane. 
646,DOCTOR: We'll cross a portal to the engine. 
647,CLARA: How can you be so sure? 
648,DOCTOR: I can't. 
649,"CLARA: Okay, well, that's watertight. "
650,"DOCTOR: Hey now, Clara, I have piloted this ship for over nine hundred"
651,"years. Trust me this one time, please. Okay. Okay. As well as all the"
652,other times. Ready? Geronimo. 
653,(They run and jump off the edge of the cliff into a white space filled
654,with pieces of metal frozen in time as they travel out from an
655,explosion.) 
656,"DOCTOR: The heart of the Tardis. The engine, it's already exploded. It"
657,must have been the collision with the salvage ship. 
658,CLARA: We're not dead. 
659,DOCTOR: She wrapped her hands around the force. Froze it. 
660,"CLARA: So, so it's safe? "
661,DOCTOR: Temporary fix. Eventually this whole place will erupt. There's
662,"no way I can save her now. She's just always been there for me, and"
663,"taken care of me, and now it's my turn and I don't know what to do. I"
664,think it just 
665,"(Clara takes his hand, and he sees the burn marks on it.) "
666,"DOCTOR: Oh, Clara. Oh. "
667,(She has Big Friendly Button burnt into her palm.) 
668,DOCTOR: You are beautiful. Beautiful fragile human skin. Like
669,parchment. Thank you. The rift in time. All the memories leaking out. I
670,need to find the moment we crashed. I need to find the music. 
671, [Under the time console] 
672, (With the music that the Brothers were playing as
673,they used their magno-grab. There is a vertical crack in the wall with
674,bright light streaming through.) 
675,"DOCTOR: The time rift. Recent past, possible future. "
676,CLARA: What are you going to do? 
677,"DOCTOR: Rewrite today, I hope. "
678,(He uses the sonic screwdriver to etch the letters onto the grenade.) 
679,DOCTOR: I've thrown this through the rift before. I need to make sure
680,this time. Going to take it in there myself. There might be a certain
681,amount of yelling. 
682,CLARA: It's going to hurt? 
683,DOCTOR: Things that end your life often do that. 
684,"CLARA: Wait! All those things you said. How we've met before, how I"
685,died. 
686,"DOCTOR: Clara, don't worry. You'll forget. Time mends us. It can mend"
687,anything. 
688,CLARA: I don't want to forget. Not all of it. The library. I saw it.
689,You were mentioned in a book. 
690,DOCTOR: I'm mentioned in a lot of books. 
691,CLARA: You call yourself Doctor. Why do you do that? You have a name.
692,I've seen it. In one corner of that tiny 
693,"DOCTOR: If I rewrite today, you won't remember. You won't go looking"
694,for my name. 
695,CLARA: You'll still have secrets. 
696,DOCTOR: It's better that way. 
697,"(The Doctor forces his way through the crack in the wall, screaming as"
698,he pushes against an immense force until he suddenly vanishes.) 
699, [Tardis] 
700," (And back to the start of the show, near enough.) "
701,"DOCTOR: Magnetic hobble-field. We're flying right into it. Clara, stay"
702,by me. 
703,CLARA: Please tell me there's a button you can press to fix this. 
704,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Big friendly button. "
705,CLARA: You're lying. 
706,DOCTOR: Yep. 
707,CLARA: To stop me freaking out? 
708,DOCTOR: Is it working? 
709,CLARA: Not so much. 
710,(The future Doctor pushes through the crack.) 
711,"FUTURE DOCTOR: Doctor, Doctor. I'm from your future. We haven't got"
712,long to reset time. 
713,(He vanishes. The grenade rolls across the floor to Clara. She picks it
714,up.) 
715,"DOCTOR: Clara, no! No! "
716,(The Doctor catches the grenade as she drops it.) 
717,DOCTOR: Ah ha! Big friendly button. 
718,(He hits it. Whiteout.) 
719, [Salvage ship] 
720, (The Tardis vanishes from their radar.) 
721,"TRICKY: I don't get it. It was on screen, then it was gone. "
722,"BRAM: Hey, robot, go get me some food. I'm starving. "
723,"GREGOR: Oi, leave him alone. "
724,BRAM: What's the matter with you? 
725,GREGOR: Maybe I've just got a little tiny scrap of decency. 
726,(On the wall is the whole photograph - the father and his three sons.) 
727, [Tardis] 
728, (The reset is complete. The encounter with the Van
729,Baalen Brothers salvage ship never happened. Clara is drying her hair.)
730,
731,CLARA: I feel exhausted. I feel 
732,DOCTOR: We've had two days crammed into the space of one. 
733,CLARA: Why would you say that? 
734,DOCTOR: I don't know. I say stuff. Ignore me. Do you feel safe? 
735,CLARA: Of course. 
736,"DOCTOR: Give me a number out of ten. Ten being whoo hoo, one being"
737,argh. 
738,CLARA: You're being weird. 
739,DOCTOR: I need to know if you feel safe. I need to know you're not
740,afraid. 
741,CLARA: Of? 
742,DOCTOR: The future. Running away with a spaceman in a box. Anything
743,could happen to you. 
744,CLARA: That's what I'm counting on. Push the button.
