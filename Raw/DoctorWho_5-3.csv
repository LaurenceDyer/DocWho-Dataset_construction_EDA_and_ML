23, [Ioniser control room]
24,
25,"(It is a land of glaciers, crevasses and massive"
26,"icicles. In the hi-tech control room, workers in plastic tunics and"
27,knee-high boots rush around turning dials on the four curved control
28,panels surrounding a circular central computer interface.) 
29,ANNOUNCER : This is a preliminary warning. Preliminary warning.
30,Prepare phase one base evacuation procedure. Phase one evacuation. 
31,"(Clent enters, leaning on a walking stick in his right hand. Say Hi to  Peter"
32,"Barkworth, everyone.) "
33,CLENT: Why has the ioniser been allowed to deteriorate to danger level?
34,
35,GARRETT: (woman) There was a power stoppage. I've done all I can to
36,boost it. 
37,"CLENT: Well, it can't be allowed to fall any lower. "
38,GARRETT: We still have time to evacuate. 
39,CLENT: We will certainly not evacuate. We've beaten its tantrums
40,before. 
41,GARRETT: It's falling again. 
42,"CLENT: Well, hold it! You must hold it steady. "
43,GARRETT: I can't. 
44,CLENT: Switch the stabilising circuits through to computer control. 
45,GARRETT: I have. It's still not holding! 
46,"CLENT: All circuits, woman. All circuits! "
47,GARRETT: We're nearly there. 
48,CLENT: There's not enough power. 
49,GARRETT: It's slowing down. 
50,CLENT: Maybe it'll hold there. 
51,GARRETT: I doubt it. 
52,"CLENT: Well, at least it gives us time. "
53,GARRETT: We need Scientist Penley. 
54,CLENT: He is no longer a member of this post. You will make this
55,machine work. 
56,"GARRETT: Yes, Leader Clent. "
57,CLENT: That's better. 
58,GARRETT: Emergency evacuation phasing set. 
59,WOMAN: Yes. 
60,GARRETT: Ioniser state fault check. 
61,WOMAN 2: Yes. 
62,GARRETT: Reactor safety sequence in operation. Good. 
63,"CLENT: You'll make an Organiser First Class yet, Miss Garrett. "
64,"GARRETT: I only follow your example, Leader Clent. "
65,(Clent sits at the central unit.) 
66,CLENT: What is the latest report from all other ioniser bases? 
67,"COMPUTER: All bases are in phase. America, glaciers held. Australasia,"
68,"glaciers held. South Africa, glaciers held. Asia, some improvement"
69,claimed. 
70,CLENT: They would. 
71,"COMPUTER: Britannicus Base Europe, slipping out of phase. Glacial"
72,advance imminent. 
73,"GARRETT: If we fail, the whole programme for glacier containment is in"
74,danger. 
75,CLENT: I'm fully aware of that fact. 
76,GARRETT: But in two hours the ioniser will be useless. 
77,CLENT: And then the glaciers will move again. Five thousand years of
78,history crushed beneath a moving mountain of ice. 
79,ANNOUNCER : Phase two evacuation. Emergency. Phase two evacuation.
80,Red state emergency. Red state emergency. 
81,CLENT: Priority override. 
82,"GARRETT: Yes, of course. But Penley was the expert. "
83,CLENT: I've had enough of experts and their crazy ideas. Where's Arden?
84,
85,"GARRETT: Still at the ice face, completing the instrumentation project."
86,
87,"CLENT: Well, hasn't he been warned? "
88,GARRETT: We couldn't get through. Surface communication's impossible
89,when 
90,"CLENT: Well, we have to tell him immediately. I cannot lose any more"
91,"men. Leader Clent to Scientist Arden at glacier face. Come in, Arden."
92,
93, [Glacier face]
94,
95,"(These men are also dressed in plastic suits, but"
96,with metal helmets and goggles too. Very appropriate for arctic
97,conditions I don't think.) 
98,"ARDEN: Walters, drill here. Now clear that trench, Walters, while I"
99,prepare the seismograph probe. 
100,"WALTERS: Sir. Get your drill ready, Davis. Sir! "
101,ARDEN: Yes? 
102,"WALTERS: Come quickly, sir! "
103,(Walters rubs snow off a wall of clear ice.) 
104,WALTERS: I could swear there's something inside. 
105,"ARDEN: Oh, not another mastodon. "
106,"WALTERS: Well, look for yourself, sir. "
107,ARDEN: Is it a man? 
108,WALTERS: Perhaps it's an animal. 
109,"ARDEN: Well, we'll soon find out. Davis, the heavy drill. "
110,"DAVIS: Yes, sir. "
111,(Walter's wrist-com beeps.) 
112,"WALTERS: Base calling, Sir. "
113,ARDEN: What do they want? 
114,WALTERS: There's nothing coming through. Poor reception. I suppose they
115,
116,"ARDEN: They'll have to wait. This is more important. Come on, Davis. "
117,"WALTERS: Well, what are we going to do, sir? "
118,ARDEN: Do? Excavate. This could be a brilliant discovery. 
119,"WALTERS: But, sir, the computerised schedule. We must stick to that. "
120,"ARDEN: Oh, must we? "
121,"WALTERS: Leader Clent will be furious, sir. "
122,"ARDEN: Well, that's just too bad. For once we'll do something on our"
123,"own account, eh? "
124,"WALTERS: There's not much base can do about it, sir. After all, we"
125,"can't even ask permission, can we? "
126,"ARDEN: Come on, Davis. Hurry, man! "
127,(ARDEN wipes away more of the snow)
128,
129, [Ioniser control room]
130,
131,"CLENT: Arden, for heavens sake man, come in! This"
132,is urgent! 
133,(But the screen is full of static. He gives up.) 
134,GARRETT: Failing again. (something) is decreasing. Not far from total
135,disintegration. 
136, [Outside the base]
137,
138,"(Snow piles up against the modular base walls, and"
139,the remains of dead trees stick out of it. The Tardis materialises on
140,"its side on a pile of snow, then slides down with the roof pointing to"
141,the ground. There are screams and squeals from inside. Someone pushes
142,at the doors.) 
143,JAMIE : Up you go. 
144,DOCTOR : Just got to get my hand there. 
145,JAMIE : You can. Now the other one. 
146,"(The Doctor emerges, wearing his fur coat.) "
147,JAMIE : Argh! 
148,DOCTOR: What's the matter? 
149,JAMIE : You're on my head! 
150,(The Doctor falls back inside. Victoria squeals. The Doctor clambers
151,out again.) 
152,JAMIE : Careful. 
153,"DOCTOR: Up you come. There we are. Come on, Victoria. Give me your"
154,hand. 
155,(All three are leaning on the Tardis 'doorstep'. Victoria has put a
156,fur-trimmed velvet cape over her tweed jacket.) 
157,DOCTOR: It was a blind landing. 
158,JAMIE: Is that what you call it? 
159,"VICTORIA: Well, no broken bones. Hey, look at the snow. "
160,"JAMIE: Oh no, not again. Tibet was bad enough, but I think you've put"
161,us down just further up the mountain. 
162,"DOCTOR: Well, let's see, shall we? Very careful. I'm going to get out."
163,It's quite a long drop. 
164,JAMIE: Up you go. 
165,"DOCTOR: Come on, Victoria. That's right. "
166,"VICTORIA: Hey, it looks like a great big wall of ice. "
167,(The Doctor's eyes pop out of his head.) 
168,JAMIE: What is it? 
169,DOCTOR: You're on my hand! 
170,"VICTORIA: But Doctor, look. "
171,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's not ice, that's plastic. "
172,"JAMIE: Yes, and see how smooth it is, and curved. "
173,DOCTOR: Yes. It's a dome. A protective dome. 
174,(Jamie shuts the Tardis doors.) 
175,VICTORIA: It's so big. Can't see the end of it. Wonder what's inside. 
176,(A door in the dome opens and a scruffy man in furs comes out. The
177,travellers duck down behind the Tardis. A second scruff comes out
178,carrying boxes.) 
179,PENLEY: Don't worry. Those alarms weren't meant for us. I wonder what's
180,"wrong, though. "
181,(Everyone say Hi! to  Peter
182,Sallis.) 
183,"STORR: (Scots) Aye, that's their problem. Come on. "
184,(The two men leave and the travellers go to the now-shut door. A wolf
185,howls nearby. The Doctor waves his hand in front of a panel and the
186,door opens. On the opposite wall is a picture of a street with
187,colonnaded shops. They go in and the door closes behind them.)
188,
189, [Ioniser control room]
190,
191,"GARRETT: Leader Clent, the video! Arden has made"
192,contact. 
193,"CLENT: Arden, can you hear me? "
194,ARDEN : Yes. What is it? 
195,CLENT: You must return to base immediately. 
196,"ARDEN : Well, don't panic. I've almost finished setting up"
197,"the seismograph probes. Davis, hurry up. "
198,"CLENT: Yes, but the ioniser's nearly at disintegration point. "
199,"ARDEN : Oh, I wonder if Penley's ears are burning. "
200,"CLENT: It's not a laughing matter, man! You know what it means. "
201,ARDEN : Yes. Cold weather ahead. I thought it felt a bit
202,nippy. 
203,"CLENT: There'll be a full enquiry into your delay, you realise that. "
204,"ARDEN : Yes, and I've got a very good reason. A fantastic"
205,discovery in the ice. 
206,"CLENT: Your task was to set up movement probes in the ice, not indulge"
207,in amateur archaeology. 
208,ARDEN : This is a man! 
209,"CLENT: Oh, congratulations. Makes a change from fossils. Now leave it"
210,and return. 
211,ARDEN : I'm bringing the body back with me. 
212,CLENT: Arden. 
213,"ARDEN : I'm sorry, I can't hear you. There seems to some"
214,interference. 
215,CLENT: Arden! 
216, [Corridor]
217,
218,(They could easily be in a stately house. A female
219,"torso statue in an alcove, ornate Regency-style chairs and side tables,"
220,portraits on the wall.) 
221,"VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor, it's just like my home. "
222,DOCTOR: I know! 
223,JAMIE: We could be 
224,ANNOUNCER : Red state emergency. Evacuation phase three. Phase
225,three evacuate. Transport section leaders report now. Phase three
226,evacuation. 
227,DOCTOR: Something's wrong. 
228,VICTORIA: It seems safe enough. 
229,(A woman walks towards them.) 
230,DOCTOR: We're discovered. 
231,(She pins labels on the travellers.) 
232,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. "
233,"JAMIE: Thank you. Excuse me, miss, I'm Jamie McCrimmon, do you think"
234,you could tell us where we are? 
235,(The woman walks away.) 
236,"DOCTOR: She doesn't want to know, Jamie. "
237,"VICTORIA: Hey, this says we're on evacuation flight seven. "
238,DOCTOR: Rather inhospitable. We've only just arrived. 
239,"JAMIE: Hey, and this tag, it says I'm a scavenger. And yours does too!"
240,"Here, we're not beggars. "
241,"DOCTOR: Hush, Jamie. "
242,VICTORIA: What is it Doctor? 
243,(The Doctor listens at a door.) 
244,DOCTOR: It sounds like electronic machinery. Like a computer. There's
245,something wrong with it's pitch. 
246,"VICTORIA: Oh, no. Now look, it might be dangerous. Now let's leave it. "
247,DOCTOR: No. 
248,VICTORIA: Doctor. 
249,DOCTOR: Let's go in. 
250,[Ioniser control room]
251,
252,(Clent is making notes on a pad.) 
253,"DOCTOR: Oh, there's something very wrong here. "
254,CLENT: Now is (something) still out of phase? Seven two point four. 
255,DOCTOR: Seven two point four? That's bad. 
256,(The Doctor follows Clent around the control desks.) 
257,"CLENT: Now balance those gauges, Miss Henry. 17 degrees out of norm. "
258,"DOCTOR: 17 degrees? Well, this is serious! "
259,"CLENT: Miss (something), report to me "
260,GARRETT: level will you? Minus one seven degrees. 
261,CLENT: One three seven-nine. 
262,"DOCTOR: One three seven nine? Excuse me, I "
263,"CLENT: Who the blazes are you? Get these scavengers out of here, quick!"
264,
265,DOCTOR: No! We're not scavengers! 
266,(General shouting as security try to grab the Doctor's coat.) 
267,"DOCTOR: No! In two minutes thirty eight seconds, you're going to have"
268,an almighty explosion! The readings say so! 
269,"CLENT: Well how can you possibly know that? I haven't even, I haven't"
270,even processed them through the computer yet! 
271,DOCTOR: I don't need a computer. 
272,GARRETT: If he's right it's already too late to escape. 
273,"DOCTOR: No, it isn't. It doesn't have to happen. If you'll excuse me. "
274,"(The Doctor runs round the control desks, giving instructions.) "
275,DOCTOR: Cut out the reactor link for a start! Uncouple the transformer
276,unit. (something) the density phase and power. 
277,GARRETT: There's insufficient power for that. 
278,"DOCTOR: Well, a quick short burst then from the reactor unit, now. Off!"
279,"Now link the circuits with the reactor link. Now, bring in the computer"
280,"stabiliser. Yes, that should hold it steady. It's not a perfect job,"
281,"mind you. You ought to get an expert in, you know. "
282,"CLENT: How did you? It was all a bluff, wasn't it, that two minutes"
283,thirty eight seconds to danger. 
284,"DOCTOR: Oh no, it was near enough correct. Give or take a second. "
285,CLENT: Rubbish. 
286,DOCTOR: Check it on your precious computer then. 
287,"CLENT: Miss Garrett, do so. "
288,(Garrett reads Clent's notes to the central terminal.) 
289,"GARRETT: Ioniser fall rate, seven two point four. Ion compensator,"
290,"minus one seven degrees. Ion flow rate, one three seven nine."
291,Assessment please. 
292,"COMPUTER: Immediate emergency. In two minutes thirty seven seconds, the"
293,reactor will explode. 
294,"DOCTOR: Well, a second out. We can't all be perfect. "
295,"GARRETT: We're at half power now, Leader Clent. "
296,"CLENT: Why, even Penley couldn't have done better. Where on earth did"
297,you spring from? It doesn't matter. Now look 
298,(Clent wobbles and puts his hand to his head.) 
299,DOCTOR: What's the matter? 
300,GARRETT: Are you all right? 
301,"CLENT: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. No, no, it's nothing. It's just an"
302,emergency added to a ten hour duty spell. 
303,GARRETT: The vibro-chair. 
304,"CLENT: Yes, you're right. Contact the Medi-Control centre the moment"
305,"there's a further downward fluctuation. We'll talk at the same time,"
306,come with me. (he leaves the room) 
307,"DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, Jamie, (something) "
308,JAMIE: Ask him where we are.
309,
310, [Glacier face]
311,
312,"(There's a sort of humanoid inside the ice,"
313,towering above the men.) 
314,ARDEN: A giant among prehistoric men. 
315,WALTERS: See the kind of armour he's got on? 
316,"ARDEN: Yes, that's rather strange. He looks pre-Viking. But no such"
317,"civilisation existed in pre-historic times, before the first ice age. "
318,"WALTERS: Proper Ice Warrior, isn't he, sir? I reckon Leader Clent'll be"
319,interested. 
320,"ARDEN: Yes. What'll the mighty computer make of it, ay? "
321,"WALTERS: Sir, hadn't we better get back while the weather still holds? "
322,"ARDEN: Good point, Walters. Davis, try bringing the air-sled a little"
323,"closer, will you? "
324,"(Davis walks out into the storm, watched by Storr and Penley,"
325,sheltering in another finger of the glacier face.) 
326,STORR: What are they up to? 
327,PENLEY: Arden's found something in the ice. Something to take back to
328,Clent. It won't be appreciated. 
329,"STORR: Aye, they ought to leave way alone. "
330,PENLEY: Arden was always a researcher. He wanted to be an archaeologist
331,when I knew him. 
332,STORR: Archaeology. What good's that? 
333,"PENLEY: It's good to know things, even when they're dead. "
334,"STORR: Nothing's sacred to you, is it? "
335,"PENLEY: I only ask questions. It's in my character, I suppose. "
336,"STORR: Aye, you swore you'd give all that up. "
337,PENLEY: Discovery is as exciting to me as the hunt is to you. But with
338,"Clent, he uses scientists craniums as stepping stones for his"
339,ambitions. 
340,"STORR: Aye, that's about all you lot are fit for. Door steps. "
341,"PENLEY: Well we're not totally useless, surely? "
342,"STORR: To me you are. Come one, we've got to move. Leave them to their"
343,stupid games. 
344,"(Penley and Storr walk out into the storm, then take cover as Davies is"
345,coming back. He looks up as a wall of snow falls off the ice face above
346,him.) 
347,WALTERS: Avalanche! Come on! 
348,PENLEY: Look out! Avalanche! 
349,(Davis is swept off his feet and down into a crevasse in front of the
350,glacier face.)
351,"PENLEY: Storr, are you alright? "
352,STORR: Penley. 
353,PENLEY: What's the damage? 
354,"STORR: My arm. It's gone, I think. "
355,PENLEY: Broken? 
356,STORR: Feels like it. 
357,"PENLEY: Well, you're lucky. There's one down there who's staying on the"
358,mountain for good. 
359,STORR: They'll come looking for him. We must move out a bit. Unless you
360,fancy trying to turn me over to your friends. 
361,"PENLEY: Six weeks ago they were my friends, but not any more. Can you"
362,walk? 
363,STORR: Aye. Just you try and keep up. Come on. 
364,"WALTERS: All clear, sir. "
365,"ARDEN: Yes, but how about Davis? "
366,WALTERS: I'll go look for him. 
367,"ARDEN: Well, let's hope he's safe. With another man gone, Clent'll skin"
368,me alive. 
369,"WALTERS: Well, if he gets too difficult, you can always set your"
370,"warrior on him, hey, sir? "
371, [Medi-control centre]
372,
373,(Clent is reclining on a chair. There is hi-tech
374,equipment scattered around and bookshelves line the walls.) 
375,CLENT: But you've no valid proof of your qualifications? 
376,"DOCTOR: Look, aren't we wasting time? If you want our help, why not"
377,tell us all about it? 
378,CLENT: All about it? All about what? Where have you been all these
379,years? 
380,"DOCTOR: Well, as a matter of fact, we've been in retreat. In Tibet. We"
381,are sanctifiers. 
382,"CLENT: Oh, I see. In Tibet. Well, if you'll take a simple test, I'll"
383,soon know if you're up to our scientific standards. 
384,DOCTOR: I see. And if I fail? 
385,CLENT: You'll be evacuated with the other scavengers in due course. 
386,"JAMIE: Oh, where to? "
387,"GARRETT: The African rehabilitation centres, of course. "
388,"VICTORIA: Oh, no, not Africa. "
389,"DOCTOR: Very well, fire away. "
390,CLENT: I present you a problem. All the major continents are threatened
391,with destruction under the glaciers of the second ice age. 
392,DOCTOR: Yes. 
393,CLENT: How would you halt the ice surge and turn the climate back to
394,normal? Forty five seconds starting from now. 
395,(Garrett starts the countdown.) 
396,"DOCTOR: Oh, possible causes. The reversal of the magnetic field. "
397,CLENT: No such change has occurred. 
398,DOCTOR: Interstellar clouds obscuring the suns rays? An excessive burst
399,of sunspot activity. A severe shift of the Earth's angle of rotation. 
400,"VICTORIA: Come on, Doctor. "
401,DOCTOR: There aren't that many alternatives. Gigantic heat loss? 
402,"CLENT: I asked for an answer, not a question. Twelve seconds left. "
403,"DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, well, in that case the answer's simple. A severe drop"
404,in the carbon dioxide level in the Earth's lower atmosphere. Is that
405,it? 
406,I would use ionisation. 
407,(The timer goes ding!) 
408,"JAMIE: Well, is he right? "
409,(Clent stands up.) 
410,"CLENT: Yes, he is. "
411,VICTORIA: Oh. But I still don't understand. 
412,"DOCTOR: Well, the carbon dioxide level in the Earth's atmosphere helps"
413,"retain the sun's heat. Take that gas away, and there's a sudden freeze"
414,up. 
415,"JAMIE: Oh, where does the gas go to? "
416,DOCTOR: Well 
417,"CLENT: You know how efficient our civilisation is, thanks to the"
418,direction of the great World Computer. And you also know how we
419,conquered the problem of world famine a century ago by artificial
420,foods. 
421,(Clent gets himself one of these from a dispenser.) 
422,"CLENT: On the land that was once used to grow the food we needed, we"
423,"built up to date living units, to house the ever-increasing population."
424,
425,DOCTOR: Up to date? 
426,"CLENT: Well, there were exceptions, of course. I mean, this house was"
427,"classified as being of historic interest. So, the amount of growing"
428,"plants on the planet, was reduced to an absolute minimum. "
429,"DOCTOR: No plants, no carbon dioxide. "
430,"CLENT: Then suddenly, one year, there was no spring. Even then it"
431,wasn't understood. Not until the ice-caps began to advance. 
432,"JAMIE: But, what's this ioniser? "
433,CLENT: Miss Garrett. 
434,GARRETT: Ionisation is a method of intensifying the sun's heat onto the
435,"Earth, but into particular areas. "
436,"DOCTOR: Yeah, it's like a magnifying glass, Jamie. "
437,"JAMIE: Oh, aye. "
438,VICTORIA: You mean you can melt glaciers and change the weather? 
439,CLENT: When certain difficulties are overcome. 
440,GARRETT: Precise control is not easy. 
441,CLENT: We can't afford to make mistakes. Ionisation can produce
442,temperatures intense enough to melt rock. 
443,GARRETT: Only by maintaining a perfect balance can we prevent
444,widespread flooding. 
445,DOCTOR: Can't your computers solve the problem of control? 
446,GARRETT: Of course they can. 
447,DOCTOR: Well. 
448,GARRETT: When the imprint data is complete they will give us the
449,solution. 
450,"DOCTOR: Oh, I see. And when will that be? "
451,"GARRETT: Soon, Doctor, soon. "
452,DOCTOR: What's the position now? 
453,"CLENT: Well, we're barely holding the glacier in check. Now, there you"
454,see a world map of the situation at the moment. And there you see
455,"what's going on in our sector. But if we fail, then not only will"
456,"Europe be swallowed up, but the balance of power will be ruined, and"
457,the whole world programme will go under. 
458,DOCTOR: And the glaciers will win. I see. 
459,"CLENT: My senior scientist, Penley, is missing. I think you have the"
460,capabilities to join us here in this great mission. Will you help us? 
461,DOCTOR: Well I'm willing to try. 
462,CLENT: Jolly good. Jolly good. Miss Garrett will give you some
463,"background information. You've worked with computers, I presume? "
464,DOCTOR: Only when I have to. 
465,"GARRETT: Well, Miss Garrett is our computer specialist. She'll help"
466,you. 
467,"DOCTOR: Oh, I'll try and remember that. "
468,GARRETT: Here we are completely computerised. 
469,"DOCTOR: Well, never mind. "
470,GARRETT: Every decision is checked to eliminate risk of failure.
471,"Because of course, all decisions, all actions, must conform to the"
472,common good.

475,"(Arden is leading the way, and the ice-encased"

482,(Clent is on the vibro-chair when Arden brings his
483,prize into the room.) 
484,"CLENT: Is this what you call your full co-operation, Arden? How do you"
485,expect us to carry out this 
486,JAMIE: There's something in it. 
487,CLENT: Great heavens. 
488,"ARDEN: Yes, I thought you'd be impressed Clent. Right, chaps. Let's"
489,"have him over here. Curtain up. This way. Head this way, tail down"
490,there. 
491,VICTORIA: What is it? 
492,JAMIE: It looks like a Viking warrior. Look at the helmet. 
493,"DOCTOR: Frozen for centuries in the ice. Perfectly preserved. Ooo,"
494,that's odd though. 
495,JAMIE: What? 
496,ARDEN: Who are you? 
497,"CLENT: An addition to our staff, Arden. What's odd, Doctor? "
498,"DOCTOR: Well the helmet, it's wrong. When this man was frozen to death"
499,only primitive cavemen existed. 
500,ARDEN: Well I say it's an undiscovered civilisation. Think of the
501,implications. 
502,"CLENT: Well, whatever the implications, it must still take second place"
503,to out ioniser project. We have our daily planning conference in three
504,"minutes fifteen seconds exactly. Come along, Arden! Play with your toy"
505,after the meeting. 
506,"(Clent, Garrett and Arden leave.) "
507,"JAMIE: Well, what's supposed to happen, Doctor? "
508,"DOCTOR: You see, this fellow Arden has set the electricity so that the"
509,"ice melts very slowly, allowing for the resistance. "
510,VICTORIA: It's working quite quickly. 
511,"DOCTOR: Well, I suspect there are some impurities in the ice. I say."
512,Look at that. 
513,JAMIE: What is it? 
514,DOCTOR: It's an electronic connection. I'm sure of it. 
515,VICTORIA: It can't be. 
516,"DOCTOR: Now you wait here, and don't touch anything. "
517,(The Doctor turns a dial and leaves. The curtain comes back down
518,blocking the ice off from the rest of the room.) 
519,JAMIE: What's got into him all of a sudden? 
520,VICTORIA: I don't know. Scientists are all alike. Eureka and all that. 
521,"JAMIE: Aye. He could do with a go on this, maybe. "
522,"(Jamie lies on the vibro-chair. Behind the curtain, chunks of ice are"
523,quickly falling off a very non-human figure with no fingers on its
524,hands.) 
525,JAMIE: Victoria? 
526,VICTORIA: What? 
527,JAMIE: You see how those lassies were dressed? 
528,"VICTORIA: Yes, I did. And trust you to think of something like that. "
529,"JAMIE: Well, I couldn't help thinking about it. "
530,"VICTORIA: Well, I think it's disgusting, wearing that kind of thing. "
531,"JAMIE: Oh, aye, so it is, so it is. You don't see yourself dressed like"
532,that then? 
533,VICTORIA: Jamie! 
534,"JAMIE: Oh, I'm sorry. It was just an idea. "
535,"VICTORIA: We will now change the subject, please. I want to look at"
536,this man.

548,
549,CLENT: He took just forty five seconds to propose
550,ionisation. No prior knowledge. 
551,"ARDEN: Well, it took us and the Academy of Scientists years. "
552,GARRETT: The computer took three milliseconds. 
553,"ARDEN: Yes, well, we had to programme it first. "
554,"CLENT: Quite. Well, before I make a final decision, I want the"
555,computer's assessment on this Doctor. 
556,GARRETT: We must be absolutely sure. 
557,CLENT: State the work potential and community value of the Doctor. 
558,COMPUTER: More information is necessary for a full evaluation. High IQ
559,"but undisciplined for our needs. Present evaluation, to be used on"
560,"research projects, but could be obstructive in certain situations. "
561,(The Doctor enters.) 
562,"DOCTOR: Oh, there you are. "
563,"CLENT: Doctor, would you mind "
564,DOCTOR: I've been looking everywhere. Why don't you label your doors? 
565,"CLENT: Yes, this is a private meeting. "
566,"DOCTOR: Yes, I realise that, and I'm sorry. "
567,CLENT: And we have not yet completed our business. 
568,"DOCTOR: Look, I wouldn't intrude if I didn't think it necessary. What I"
569,"have to say is extremely important. After all, you did ask me to help"
570,"you, didn't you? "
571,ARDEN: Has something happened to the warrior? 
572,"DOCTOR: Well, it has something to do with that, yes. "
573,CLENT: We have more serious matters on hand. 
574,DOCTOR: This is serious! 
575,"ARDEN: Now let him tell us, Clent. Well? "
576,"DOCTOR: Thank you. It's the, it's the helmet. It's not what we thought"
577,it was. 
578,CLENT: It's a prehistoric drinking cup. 
579,DOCTOR: No! It has electronic connections. 
580,CLENT: E? What are you talking about? 
581,ARDEN: But that's impossible. You must be mistaken. 
582,"DOCTOR: No, I'm positive. You realise what this means? "
583,ARDEN: Well it must mean the civilisation he came from must be more
584,advanced than we thought. 
585,"DOCTOR: Yes, indeed. They even had astronauts, it appears. "
586,CLENT: How do you mean? 
587,DOCTOR: This headpiece is no warriors tin-hat. It's a highly
588,sophisticated space helmet! 
589,"CLENT: Aren't you jumping to conclusions, Doctor, for a scientist? "
590,ARDEN: But if this is true? 
591,DOCTOR: If this is true your project is in danger. 
592,"CLENT: In what way? How can one preserved body, however old, effect us?"
593,
594,"DOCTOR: How did he get here? Well, he didn't walk, did he? "
595,"CLENT: Well, if what you say is true, by spaceship. "
596,"DOCTOR: Yes, and where is that spaceship now? "
597,ARDEN: In the glacier. Then it must still be intact. He had no signs of
598,"mutilation. He couldn't have crashed. He must of landed. Clent, can't"
599,you see the importance of such a discovery? 
600,CLENT: The propulsion unit of the spacecraft is probably 
601,GARRETT: Probably atomic powered. 
602,"CLENT: Quite. And, er, if we use the ioniser at full power "
603,DOCTOR: This reactor pile could be exploded or be activated. 
604,CLENT: But if we don't 
605,GARRETT: The whole area will be contaminated. 
606,"CLENT: But if we don't use the ioniser, what then? We are part of a"
607,"world plan. Now,"
608,if we hold back that plan cannot go into operation. 
609,GARRETT: We could hold it at minimal power. 
610,CLENT: Not good enough. 
611,"ARDEN: No, we daren't take the risk. The contamination level would last"
612,for five decades or more. 
613,CLENT: It merely makes the fine control of the heat level even more
614,vital. 
615,"DOCTOR: Yes, well, I thought you ought to know. "
616,"CLENT: Yes, you were right, thank you. I must inform the computer"
617,immediately for its decision. 
618,"ARDEN: Well, we shall need more facts. "
619,"CLENT: Well, furnish me with facts then! "
620,(Jamie enters.) 
621,JAMIE: Doctor! 
622,DOCTOR: Jamie! 
623,JAMIE: The warrior's come alive! 
624,ARDEN: Alive? 
625,"CLENT, DOCTOR + GARRETT: What? "
626,JAMIE: He's taken Victoria. I couldn't stop him! 
627,ARDEN: Alive. and I found it.
628,
629, [Medi-control centre]
630,
631,CLENT: Alive? 
632,DOCTOR: Strange. 
633,CLENT: How did it happen? 
634,"JAMIE: Well, we were just talking, and I turned, and there he was"
635,standing right next to us. 
636,"ARDEN: That's impossible. To be preserved, yes, but to come alive?"
637,Impossible. 
638,"DOCTOR: For a human being, maybe. "
639,"ARDEN: What, not human? "
640,DOCTOR: Look at this table. 
641,"CLENT: Well, it's been burned. "
642,"ARDEN: Well, I used a low voltage especially. "
643,"DOCTOR: Yes, but a high current. "
644,ARDEN: Yes but it was quite safe. 
645,DOCTOR: But if that current passed through a low resistance. 
646,GARRETT: Extremely high temperatures. 
647,CLENT: The intense heat must have shocked him back into life. 
648,"JAMIE: Oh look, I don't know what you're all talking about, but all I"
649,know is Victoria's in danger and what are we doing to save her? 
650,"DOCTOR: Yes Jamie, you're right. Come on. She can't have gone far. "
651,"JAMIE: Well, come on then."

659,"ANNOUNCER : Danger red alert, danger red alert. Intruders within"
660,perimeter. Capture and control. Priority one. 
661,"CLENT: Well, that'll be just too bad. Obviously I can't release men for"
662,an extensive search outside the base. 
663,DOCTOR: But she may be in danger of her life! You can't take that
664,decision! 
665,CLENT: Very well. You want an impartial opinion? I shall ask the
666,computer. 
667,"JAMIE: Oh, not the computer. "

674,"(Believe it or not, that is  Bernard Bresslaw"
675,underneath all
676,that fibreglass.) 
677,VICTORIA: Where are you from? 
678,VARGA: From the Red Planet. 
679,VICTORIA: Mars? We thought you were dead and then you came alive. What
680,happened? 
681,VARGA: Too many questions. 
682,"VICTORIA: I'm curious, that's all. "
683,VARGA: I need answers from you. 
684,VICTORIA: I don't think I can help you very much. 
685,VARGA: Answers. 
686,VICTORIA: Is that a gun? 
687,VARGA: How long was I in the ice? 
688,"VICTORIA: I don't know, I. One of the scientists said you must have"
689,been there since the first ice age. Thousands of years ago. 
690,VARGA: That cannot be true. 
691,VICTORIA: Were there others with you? 
692,VARGA: Yes. Our spaceship crashed at the foot of the ice mountain. As
693,"we came out to investigate, a great avalanche of snow buried us. "
694,"VICTORIA: Then the others are still trapped in the glacier, then. "
695,VARGA: I will free them. Then we will return to the Red Planet. 
696,VICTORIA: How? You can't get them out by yourself. 
697,VARGA: You will help. How was I brought to life? 
698,VICTORIA: Let the scientists here on Earth help you. 
699,VARGA: Tell me! They would not help me. They would keep me as a
700,"curiosity, and they would leave my warriors for dead, or destroy them. "
701,"VICTORIA: No. No, they, they wouldn't. "
702,"VARGA: But with my men, I can talk from strength. Then we shall decide."
703,
704,VICTORIA: Decide? Decide what? 
705,"VARGA: Whether to go back to our own world, or to conquer this."
706,

710,should we act? 
711,"JAMIE: Och, how's a machine to know? "
712,"DOCTOR: Come on, Jamie, have patience. Give it a chance. "
713,COMPUTER: Ionisation programme should continue as planned. A limited
714,number of lives are expected to be lost. 
715,"JAMIE: What about Victoria, though? "
716,"DOCTOR: Shush, Jamie. "
717,"COMPUTER: However, the suspected presence of an alien spacecraft must"
718,"be investigated, in case of potentially fissionable material. "
719,"JAMIE: Spacecraft! Hey, do you reckon that's where the warrior's gone"
720,back to? 
721,"DOCTOR: Well, he didn't come by Shetland Pony, Jamie. "
722,COMPUTER: In order to accommodate this priority the workload has been
723,rescheduled to free one scientist investigator. 
724,CLENT: Who should be released? 
725,COMPUTER: Scientist Arden. 
726,"CLENT: Well, Arden, do you think you could handle this ice giant"
727,single-handed? 
728,"ARDEN: Well, I shall need at least one guard. "
729,"JAMIE: Well, what about me then? I could go with him. "
730,"DOCTOR: Yes, he's a capable lad. "
731,"CLENT: Well, the computer said one investigator only. "
732,"DOCTOR: That was from your staff, Jamie's extra. "
733,JAMIE: Aye. 
734,GARRETT: The mission must be carried out. The computer has ordered it. 
735,"CLENT: As the Doctor has agreed to help us with the ioniser. Yes, very"
736,"well, the boy can go. "
737,DOCTOR: Oh good. 
738,"CLENT: But you must leave immediately, because the sooner we know"
739,"whether there is a reactor buried inside that glacier or not, the"
740,better. 
741,"JAMIE: Aye, maybe, but Victoria's important too, you know. "

761,"STORR: Ach, it's nothing. "
762,PENLEY: What I like about you is if a polar bear got you you'd give him
763,"indigestion. Feeling fuzzy in the head, eh? "
764,STORR: I will not let it beat me. Is it going to be bad? 
765,PENLEY: You won't know much about it. 
766,STORR: My mouth's dry. 
767,PENLEY: Here's a what do you call it? A tomato. It's nearly ripe. 
768,"STORR: Ach, you shouldnae have done that. I've been waiting weeks for"
769,that to ripen properly. 
770,"PENLEY: Take it, it'll do you good. "
771,STORR: Ach. 
772,"PENLEY: Well, there are advantages to living in a plant museum, even"
773,this close to the glacier. 
774,"STORR: Ah, so even a scientist can appreciate it then? "
775,"PENLEY: Well, there's warmth and food. Selected ancient food plants."
776,"Tomatoes, carrots, potatoes, strawberries. A world out of Atlantis. "
777,"STORR: Aye, helps me picture how it was before they killed off all the"
778,"plants. There was spring then, and flowers. You could pick the fruit"
779,off the trees. Now you rotten scientists (coughs) drop down dead. 
780,PENLEY: Even so it's not the nicest way to live. 
781,STORR: Aye. 
782,PENLEY: An avalanche waiting on your doorstep. 
783,STORR: Not leaving here until I have to. 
784,PENLEY: Granted. 
785,"STORR: You're not going out after food, are you? You wouldn't know what"
786,"to do without me. Where are you going, anyway? "
787,"PENLEY: Well I've learnt enough from you to take care of myself, and"
788,it's for your idiotic sake that I'm going. 
789,STORR: Where to? 
790,PENLEY: The base. 
791,STORR: You're going to hand me in to rehabilitation. Africa. Never

829,CLENT [on screen]: That was not the purpose of your mission. Please
830,report correctly. 
831,ARDEN: No reading obtainable. The sensor is being jammed by some sort
832,of a screening device. I can't make head nor tail of it. 
833,CLENT [on screen]: But something is in there. 
834,ARDEN: Correct.

868,project I've handled with ease. Nothing has failed. I was chosen
869,"because I never fail. When I handpicked the team, I made one vital"
870,mistake. 
871,DOCTOR: This chap Penley. 
872,"CLENT: Best man in Europe for ionisation studies. As it turned out,"
873,hopelessly temperamental. 
874,DOCTOR: Temperamental or individual? Creative scientists have to be
875,allowed some head you know. 
876,CLENT: Creative? Poppycock. When he walked out of here he proclaimed
877,"himself to be criminally, criminally irresponsible. "
878,DOCTOR: It couldn't have been just a simple gesture of protest? 
879,"CLENT: He was always protesting. This is a team, a team with a mission."
880,"If we fail, others cannot succeed. "
881,DOCTOR: And your name will suffer. That's important. 
882,CLENT: I lead the team. I depend on the experts I picked. My judgement
883,was sound. Others won't see it that way. 
884,DOCTOR: So you do need Penley. 
885,"CLENT: No, I do not need Penley. But I do need an equivalent brain. But"
886,it would be months before anyone else could pick up the knowledge that
887,"Penley acquired here. Just isn't time, that's the pertinent issue. "
888,"DOCTOR: Well, I'll try and help you, but I do think you might try"

892,in the Medi-Control Centre is ready.

897,VICTORIA: I'm looking! 
898,(Something falls and she jumps.) 
899,"VICTORIA: Yes, yes, they look like the one. Yes, yes. "
900,"VARGA: You are coming with me, to the ice mountain. "
901,"VICTORIA: No, please. "
902,(Clent enters.) 
903,CLENT: Who are you? 
904,(Varga knocks out Clent.) 
905,VICTORIA: You killed him! 
906,VARGA: Come. 
907,(Varga and Victoria leave. Penley comes out of hiding and the Doctor
908,enters.) 
909,"PENLEY: I er, I was going to give him this. "
910,"DOCTOR: Oh, that's disgusting. It's just the thing. Did you do this? "
911,PENLEY: I've come very close to it at times. I've never seen him look
912,so peaceful. 
913,"DOCTOR: Oh, he'll be all right. Did you see who did do it? "
914,PENLEY: Yes. A monstrous looking creature. I didn't like the look of
915,him at all. 
916,DOCTOR: Was there a girl there? 
917,"PENLEY: Yes, she seemed scared stiff. "
918,"DOCTOR: Well, why didn't you try and stop them? "
919,"PENLEY: Well, I came here to get some drugs for a man who is sick. I"
920,couldn't run the risk of getting caught. 
921,DOCTOR: But she's only a young girl! 
922,PENLEY: She's alive. My friend will die if I don't get back. 
923,"DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I see. "
924,PENLEY: Are you going after them? I can take you part of the way. 
925,"DOCTOR: No, no, they're searching already. There's a red alarm all over"
926,the base. 
927,"PENLEY: Well, I've got what I want. I'm off. "
928,DOCTOR: Penley? 
929,PENLEY: You know about me then. My escapades in computer-land. 
930,"DOCTOR: They need you here, you know. They need you desperately. "
931,PENLEY: Needing isn't getting. I'm free of their problems for good. 
932,"DOCTOR: They're your problems too, you know. It's your world. "
933,"PENLEY: My world is up here. Private and no admittance. Well, I'm going"
934,to go then. 
935,DOCTOR: I expect you know what you're doing. 
936,PENLEY: You know it's nice to meet one that they haven't got at yet. 
937,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. "
938,PENLEY: Goodbye. 
939,DOCTOR: Goodbye. 
940,(Penley leaves. The Doctor puts the smelling salts under Clent's nose.)

943,"(Garrett, Jamie and Arden enter.) "
944,DOCTOR: Where's Victoria? 
945,GARRETT: Leader Clent! 
946,ARDEN: What's happened? 
947,CLENT: Where are they? 
948,GARRETT: I've just had a message from the perimeter gate. He smashed
949,"his way through, taking the girl with him. "
950,CLENT: He knocked me out with a power pack. 
951,DOCTOR: With a power pack? You mean the one that you used to unfreeze
952,him? 
953,CLENT: Yes. And he and the girl have many more. 
954,ARDEN: To revitalise others like himself. 
955,CLENT: Others? What do you mean. We don't know that there are others. 
956,"JAMIE: Well now, he'll head for the glacier. Let's get way after him. "
957,DOCTOR: No. That's what he wants us to do. That's why he's taken
958,"Victoria with him as a hostage. No, we must let him show his hand"
959,first. 
960,JAMIE: But we can't just stand around waiting? 
961,DOCTOR: We're not going to. Only until morning. That'll be time enough.
962,
963,"CLENT: No, now! Must I remind you of the mission that you have yet to"
964,accomplish? 
965,"ARDEN: Oh no, Clent, not at night. Not for you or anybody. You've never"
966,been out there at night.

974,VARGA: You'll see. Don't try to run away. 
975,VICTORIA: I was only going to watch you.

983,"chap, I'm going to do a bit of hunting myself, up on the glacier."
984,"Something strange is happening, Elric Penley, honoured sir. That"
985,"warrior, that girl, that funny, scruffy looking chap. Something strange"
986,indeed. Something disturbing. Something to do with the ice. And if what
987,"that particular chap has said is true, if they really need me, it may"
988,mean the parting of the ways for us.

1002,"JAMIE: Wish me luck, Doctor. "
1003,"DOCTOR: You take care of yourself, Jamie, and keep an eye on Arden. I"
1004,don't think he quite realises how dangerous this creature is. 
1005,JAMIE: After what's happened here? He must be blind. 
1006,"DOCTOR: Well, he's a scientist and a bit inclined to have his head in"
1007,the air. You know what they're like. 
1008,"JAMIE: Aye, I certainly do. "
1009,"ARDEN: Are you all ready, lad? "
1010,"JAMIE: Aye, let's away. "
1011,DOCTOR: Good luck. 
1012,"ARDEN: Now we don't know how many of them there are, so we'll have to"
1013,tread carefully. 
1014,"CLENT: You will not expose yourself to any unnecessary violence, Arden?"
1015,
1016,"ARDEN: Now listen, Clent, we both know that I'm responsible for what"
1017,has happened. If I hadn't brought that creature back here in the first
1018,"place, none of this would have occurred. I also caused the death of"
1019,"Davis. I can't forget that, either. "
1020,"CLENT: Well, you just remember your mission, that's all. And no wild"
1021,sorties after the girl. It's vital that you get your information back
1022,to us immediately. 
1023,"JAMIE: Look, we'll not leave Victoria to the warriors, if that's what"
1024,you mean. If there's half a chance of us two 
1025,CLENT: You will take your orders from Scientist Arden! Act according to
1026,"your priorities, Arden. "
1027,"ARDEN: Come along, boy. "
1028,CLENT: Arden? 
1029,ARDEN: Yes? 
1030,"CLENT: Don't be to too hard on yourself. Scientists must question, you"
1031,"know. I mean, if I'd been in your shoes I think I'd have done the same."
1032,"I'd have, I'd have brought it back. So, anyway, good luck. "
1033,"DOCTOR: Good luck, Jamie! "
1034,"JAMIE: And you, Doctor. "
1035,(Arden and Jamie leave.) 
1036,"CLENT: Well, Doctor, let's see you go into action. I'll just get Miss"
1037,Garrett to take you over the set-up here. 
1038,"DOCTOR: Miss Garrett? Oh, no, no. There's no need to go into"
1039,formalities. 
1040,CLENT: Miss Garrett? I like things done properly. Where is she? 
1041,"DOCTOR: Now Clent, just remember I am not a member of your staff. I'm"
1042,"just a working guest, as you might say. "
1043,"CLENT: Yes, of course. But this is a formal establishment, and our"
1044,regulations 
1045,"DOCTOR: Your regulations do not apply to me. I work in my own way,"
1046,freely. 
1047,"CLENT: I see. Like Penley. Regulations seemed to bother him, too."
1048,"Probably caused his eventual breakdown, in fact. "
1049,DOCTOR: Breakdown? I thought you said he defected? 
1050,"CLENT: Did I? Well, one thing lead to another, naturally. He was under"
1051,"a great deal of pressure. Just too much for him, that's all. "
1052,"DOCTOR: Oh, I see."

1055,
1056,STORR: A creature growing out of the ice! Bah! 
1057,PENLEY: I assure you that what I saw was very real. And terrifying. 
1058,STORR: You've been out on the mountain too long. It takes some people
1059,that way. Especially the brainy ones. 
1060,"PENLEY: Hmmm. Very well, don't believe me, but I still intend to find"
1061,out. 
1062,"STORR: Ah well, you can leave me out of your fun and games. I've got"
1063,enough troubles of my own. 
1064,"PENLEY: You're fit enough now. To do the cooking, at least. Thanks to"
1065,science. 
1066,"STORR: Science! Och, it wasn't science, it was just good plain"
1067,"doctoring. And if you smirk again like that, I'll crack your head open"
1068,with this. 
1069,"PENLEY: Yes, you're definitely back to your normal witty self. What's"
1070,the matter? 
1071,STORR: Someone's outside. 
1072,PENLEY: They must have tracked me here from the base. Hide yourself. We
1073,don't want you carted off to Africa yet. You! 
1074,"GARRETT: I followed you. It's all right, I'm alone. "
1075,PENLEY: What do you want? 
1076,"GARRETT: Elric, we're in desperate trouble at the base. You're the only"
1077,one who can help us. 
1078,PENLEY: Clent doesn't need me. All he wants is a mirror. Preferably
1079,rose-tinted. 
1080,GARRETT: He does need you to make the ioniser work again. 
1081,PENLEY: Is that all? 
1082,GARRETT: No. He's faced with having to report the full situation to
1083,World Control. 
1084,"PENLEY: Oh well, now we're coming to it, aren't we? The great Clent"
1085,"would have to admit failure. That's it, isn't it? Poor old Clent. He"
1086,"never could face the music. Here, what about this creature at the"
1087,glacier? 
1088,GARRETT: That's only part of our trouble. The real problem is the
1089,ioniser. Will you come? 
1090,"PENLEY: It's typical of him to send you, instead of armed guards. "
1091,GARRETT: He doesn't know I'm here. I'm asking you. 
1092,PENLEY: I won't come. 
1093,"GARRETT: But you can't just step aside. A man like you, living like a"
1094,scavenger? It's utterly wrong. Civilisation needs you. 
1095,"PENLEY: Jane, I chose this existence. I chose it because I refuse to be"
1096,sucked into that computerised ant-heap you call a civilisation. I'm a
1097,"man, not a machine. I will not return. "
1098,GARRETT: Not even to save the world? 
1099,"PENLEY: Save the world? Well, that has a fine Clentian ring to it. No"
1100,"thanks, no. It'll take more than me to do that. But don't you worry,"
1101,you don't get rid of my sort all that easily. Machines corrode and
1102,"rust, but mankind goes on. You'll find Clent one of these days in a"
1103,"museum, like that ancient stove, with an inscription round him."
1104,"Robotised human mark two, now extinct. But you'll find others like me"
1105,still alive. 
1106,"GARRETT: Surely, Elric, that's all the more reason to come back. To"
1107,change things. 
1108,"PENLEY: Don't you understand, Jane? Clent's just a talker. He's a glib"
1109,"political animal. Even if I did change things, the Clent's of this"
1110,world would still come out on top. Running things according to their
1111,"own whims and indulgences. And the pity of it is, they believe they're"
1112,right. 
1113,"GARRETT: Then you leave me no alternative. You will come, and now! "
1114,PENLEY: You must be desperate. But tranquillising me isn't going to
1115,make it any easier. You'd never be able to carry me all that way. 
1116,STORR: Oh no you don't! 
1117,GARRETT: Who's this? 
1118,PENLEY: Just a friend. Now what are you going to do? 
1119,GARRETT: Return to base and wait for the inevitable disaster. 
1120,"STORR: Oh no, you don't. I'm not having you set the dogs on me. I'd as"
1121,soon put an end to her game. Give me that. 
1122,"PENLEY: Storr, no. She won't put us away. "
1123,"GARRETT: No, I won't. "
1124,STORR: I don't trust any of them. 
1125,GARRETT: Please trust me enough to come with me to safety. Apart from
1126,"the danger of the glacier, these creatures. "
1127,"PENLEY: Oh yes, your ice warriors. Well, we shall just have to take our"
1128,"chance. No, I won't return. And now you must go. But if Sir Genius does"
1129,"have trouble with the ioniser, look up my notes on the Omega factor. "
1130,GARRETT: Thank you for that at least. 
1131,(Garrett leaves.) 
1132,STORR: This ice warrior. It's real then. 
1133,PENLEY: Oh yes. And I'm going up there again. 
1134,"STORR: But why, man? "
1135,"PENLEY: Because I must know. Now, put this knife to more sensible use."

1143,ZONDAL: Commander. 
1144,VARGA: You will locate our buried spaceship without delay. 
1145,ZONDAL: That will not be difficult. 
1146,VARGA: You will excavate sufficient space to form a cave. 
1147,ZONDAL: A cave. 
1148,VARGA: To act as a trap. 
1149,VICTORIA: A trap? Who for? 
1150,VARGA: Do not interfere. Your friends may attack us. 
1151,VICTORIA: But they don't want to attack you. They could help you. 
1152,VARGA: We do not need help. 
1153,VICTORIA: You'd still be frozen and dead if it wasn't for us. 
1154,VARGA: You are a child. 
1155,"VICTORIA: Oh, why won't you listen? "
1156,VARGA: Commence. 
1157,VICTORIA: What are you going to do with me? 
1158,VARGA: Bait. Bait for the trap. 
1159,ZONDAL: Activate direction sensors. Steady. Sonic stalls ready. Set to
1160,wide impact. Take aim. Continuous fire!

1165,to give a density ratio. Excuse me. Excuse me! Yes. 
1166,"CLENT: Genius at work, I see. Good morning Doctor. "
1167,DOCTOR: Mmm? Yes. 
1168,"CLENT: Well, this is all very impressive, Doctor, but don't you think"
1169,it'd be simpler to use a computer? 
1170,DOCTOR: Four. What computer? 
1171,CLENT: The base computer. 
1172,"DOCTOR: Six. Yes, they're useful for digital analysis, but I very"
1173,"rarely use them, except when I have to. There is one thing you could do"
1174,for me which would be very important. 
1175,"CLENT: Yes, yes, anything. What is it? "
1176,"DOCTOR: Lend me a pencil. Oh, that would be even better. "
1177,"CLENT: Doctor, would you mind explaining just what it is that you are "
1178,"DOCTOR: Now, this is wrong, this is wrong. It's not right. There's"
1179,something missing. 
1180,CLENT: Would these figures help? 
1181,DOCTOR: Supposing I? What are they? 
1182,CLENT: Data readings from the other bases. 
1183,"DOCTOR: Oh, computer checked, I hope? "
1184,CLENT: Of course. 
1185,"DOCTOR: Oh, thank heavens for that. "
1186,(Garrett enters.) 
1187,"GARRETT: Doctor, I've found something here that I think you might "
1188,"CLENT: Where have you been, Miss Garrett? Your instructions were to"
1189,"help the Doctor, were they not? "
1190,"GARRETT: Yes, Leader Clent. I have been looking up Scientist Penley's"
1191,notes. These. Could these help? 
1192,"DOCTOR: What are they? Omega. Well, what does he mean? Omega. What does"
1193,"he? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Yes! Yes, of course. The Omega"
1194,Factor! There and here and there. Yes! Ha ha! Your friend Penley is
1195,very clever. 
1196,CLENT: Is that it? 
1197,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's it! "
1198,CLENT: That's fantastic. 
1199,"DOCTOR: Oh, when you've been at it as long as I have it's nothing. "
1200,GARRETT: Do you think it could possibly work? 
1201,CLENT: It's very possible. 
1202,"DOCTOR: Possible? It's perfect! Well, it's nearly perfect. "
1203,CLENT: We shall see. 
1204,"DOCTOR: Oh, it'll work, all right. "
1205,"CLENT: The computer will confirm that, I'm sure. "
1206,DOCTOR: Computer? 
1207,"GARRETT: Well, everything's checked. "
1208,DOCTOR: I resent that! 
1209,"CLENT: Just normal practice, Doctor. "
1210,DOCTOR: It should be the other way round. 
1211,CLENT: We have to be quite sure. It'll only take a matter of seconds.
1212,"Copy all this down, Miss Garrett, and then we can feed it through the"
1213,computer and do a simulator run. I'll just go and set it up. 
1214,"DOCTOR: I shall demand an apology, you know. "
1215,GARRETT: We may not have time for that. 
1216,"DOCTOR: Well, I'm glad you had time to look up Penley's notes. "
1217,GARRETT: I thought it might be useful. 
1218,DOCTOR: Pity that he turned traitor. 
1219,"GARRETT: Oh, Clent might call him that, but he's still the most"
1220,brilliant scientist we have.

1231,ARDEN : We've arrived at the glacier site. There's
1232,something strange. 
1233,CLENT: What is? 
1234,ARDEN : The ice face. It's been excavated into a cave. 
1235,DOCTOR: How? 
1236,"ARDEN : By some kind of tool, I think. "
1237,CLENT: Is there any sign of a spacecraft? 
1238,ARDEN : Yes. 
1239,DOCTOR: There is? Where? 
1240,"ARDEN : Well, at the back of the cave, there's what looks"
1241,like a metal door in the ice.
1242,

1248,"quickly, Arden. "
1249,ARDEN: I'll take care. 
1250,JAMIE: What readings? 
1251,"ARDEN: Radiation, magnetic field and ion density. Won't take long. "

1259,VARGA: Remove her inside. 
1260,"VICTORIA: Oh, leave me alone! Oh, please. Haven't you done enough?"
1261,"Please, leave me alone! I want to go back! Please! "
1262,ZONDAL: There may be more of them. 
1263,"VARGA: If more of them come, we will destroy them. If no more of them"
1264,"come, we will know there are not enough of them to resist us. "
1265,ZONDAL: Let us destroy the girl now. 
1266,VARGA: They came after her. She is obviously of some value to them. 
1267,ZONDAL: Then they will try again. 
1268,"VARGA: We shall be ready for them. But first, Zondal, you have a task"

1306,DOCTOR: I told you it would. 
1307,CLENT: Good. Good. Jolly good. Success is at last possible. Inform all
1308,"ioniser bases, Miss Garrett. Thank you, Doctor. It's a triumph. "
1309,"DOCTOR: Very likely. But somewhere, out on that ice face, are two young"
1310,people for whom I have considerable affection. That is no triumph! 
1311,"CLENT: I appreciate your feelings. I, too, have lost a colleague. "
1312,"DOCTOR: They're not colleagues, they're friends. "
1313,"CLENT: We cannot be sentimental in this situation, Doctor. Our mission"
1314,continues. We must all play our part. 
1315,DOCTOR: I've played mine. It's finished. 
1316,"CLENT: What a triumph. Europe saved. Science the victor over nature,"
1317,"and it happened in my sector. Well, it's not the first time. "
1318,GARRETT: Now we can go ahead. It only needs programming. 
1319,DOCTOR: Aren't you forgetting something? 
1320,"CLENT: I'm sorry, but some lives are bound to be lost. "
1321,"DOCTOR: No, no, I don't mean that. Arden. He's not yet completed his"
1322,mission. 
1323,"GARRETT: Oh yes, of course. The spaceship reactor. We daren't proceed"
1324,until we've heard from Arden. 
1325,CLENT: Where is he? Where is he? Where is he?

1328,
1329,STORR: What did you have to bring him back here
1330,for? Another mouth to feed. 
1331,"PENLEY: You may hate scientists, Storr, but there's no need to hate all"
1332,human beings. 
1333,STORR: I don't trust anyone from Clent's base. 
1334,"JAMIE: Who are you? Where's Arden? What happened?! Oh, my head. "
1335,PENLEY: Now you must rest. You're suffering from severe shock. Now just
1336,lie still. 
1337,"JAMIE: Well, where am I? "
1338,"STORR: Ah, never you mind. Somewhere safe. "
1339,"JAMIE: Well, what happened to me and Arden? "
1340,PENLEY: Arden's dead. You were both shot down by the warriors. 
1341,JAMIE: Arden dead? 
1342,PENLEY: They used some sort of ray gun. 
1343,JAMIE: So we failed. 
1344,STORR: You came to rescue the girl? Is that it? 
1345,JAMIE: You've seen Victoria? Is she still alive? 
1346,"PENLEY: Yes, she is alive. "
1347,"JAMIE: Then we can still save her! You will help me, please! "
1348,PENLEY: Now you're not yet well enough. We'll discuss it later. 
1349,"JAMIE: No, it'll be to late then. They might. Oh, my head. No, you must"
1350,help me save Victoria. It'll be too late.

1361,"ZONDAL: The girl, Commander. She will betray us. "
1362,VARGA: She has courage. But she is also very stupid to think that we
1363,would not watch her every move. 
1364,ZONDAL: She must be stopped.

1376,DOCTOR: Are you all right? 
1377,"VICTORIA : Yes, but, oh Doctor, something terrible's"
1378,happened! 
1379,DOCTOR: What? 
1380,"VICTORIA : They, they've shot Jamie and Arden! "
1381,"DOCTOR: What? Well, is he dead? Is, is he wounded? Is he badly wounded?"
1382,
1383,VICTORIA : I don't know.

1388,
1389,"VICTORIA: Arden's body's still here and he's dead,"
1390,"but the warriors are from Mars, and. Oh, Doctor, it's horrible! "
1391,"CLENT : Keep calm, girl. We want facts. Tell us about the"
1392,spacecraft first. 
1393,"VICTORIA: No, please, please listen to me. Arden's dead, and Jamie's"

1410,VARGA: Let her talk first. 
1411,ZONDAL: They will know our numbers. 
1412,VARGA: They will also know she is alive. She is the bait.

1415,
1416,"DOCTOR: Victoria, tell us more about the warriors. "
1417,VICTORIA : They're from Mars. 
1418,CLENT: They're not important. Have you seen the propulsion unit of the
1419,"spacecraft, girl? "
1420,VICTORIA : Propulsion unit? 
1421,CLENT: The engines. 
1422,"VICTORIA : Oh, yes. They're busy repairing them now. "
1423,CLENT: What kind are they? It's vitally important. 
1424,VICTORIA : I have no idea. 
1425,"CLENT: Well, reactor turbine? Ion jet? Anti-gravity? Think, girl! "
1426,"DOCTOR: Can you describe them to us, Victoria dear? "
1427,"VICTORIA : Yes, yes, I think so. "
1428,"CLENT: Well hurry, girl! "
1429,"VICTORIA: Look, it isn't easy. Now I have to have time to think. "
1430,(The screen fills with static.)

1433,VICTORIA : I'm all right.

1435, [Glacier cave]

1437,VICTORIA: It's the glacier. It's moving all the
1438,time.

1440,CLENT : The engines. Tell us about the engines. 
1441,[Spacecraft]
1442,
1443,VARGA: She has told them enough. Bring her in. 
1444,ZONDAL: Destroy her. 
1445,"VARGA: You are wrong, Zondal. She must answer some questions first. Why"
1446,are they so interested in our engines? Why are they afraid?

1449,
1450,VICTORIA : There's someone coming. 
1451,DOCTOR: Victoria. Victoria. Can you see the base from where you are? 
1452,"VICTORIA : Yes. Yes, I can. "
1453,DOCTOR: Do you think you can get back to it? 
1454,VICTORIA : I can give it a try. 
1455,"DOCTOR: Well, get in contact again as soon as you can. Good luck."

1464,
1465,DOCTOR: Yes. This is an automatic chemical
1466,"dispenser, is it not? "
1467,GARRETT: Yes. 
1468,DOCTOR: How does it work? 
1469,"CLENT: Well, you choose the category of the article that you want by"
1470,indicating it on one of these little chaps here. Jolly good. And now
1471,you dial the precise chemical formula that you want there. 
1472,DOCTOR: May I? There's something I need rather desperately. 
1473,(The Doctor dials in a short formula. The machine dispenses a sealed
1474,plastic cup. The Doctor removes the seal.) 
1475,"CLENT: Oh, what's that? "
1476,DOCTOR: Water. 
1477,(The Doctor drinks it.) 
1478,CLENT: Indeed. 
1479,"DOCTOR: Ah, that's better. Now then, let's see. Jamie has vanished. "
1480,(The Doctor does more dialing.) 
1481,DOCTOR: Victoria's on her way back to the base. And neither of them can
1482,help us with our main problem. 
1483,(The Doctor takes a phial from the dispenser.) 
1484,DOCTOR: An exact description of the spacecrafts propulsion unit. 
1485,GARRETT: That will? 
1486,DOCTOR: I will. 
1487,CLENT: With the help of ammonium sulphide? 
1488,"DOCTOR: We know these creatures come from Mars, don't we? What do we"
1489,know about their planets atmospheric conditions? 
1490,"GARRETT: Chiefly nitrogen, with virtually no oxygen or hydrogen. "
1491,"DOCTOR: Then they're not going to enjoy this little concoction much,"
1492,are they? 
1493,CLENT: What? You mean you intend to use it as a kind of toxic gas? 
1494,"DOCTOR: Well, if I'm going to an alien spaceship it may come in handy. "
1495,CLENT: Now don't be ridiculous. We've lost Arden already. 
1496,DOCTOR: Arden fell into a trap. I know what to expect. 
1497,CLENT: I refuse to allow you to go! 
1498,DOCTOR: Splendid! You go instead then! 
1499,GARRETT: No one can be spared. Least of all Leader Clent. 
1500,DOCTOR: I can be spared. I've done all I can here. The ioniser will
1501,work without me. I'd start getting it ready if I were you. 
1502,CLENT: But if anything goes wrong with the countdown? 
1503,"DOCTOR: Oh, you'll manage. "
1504,CLENT: No. 
1505,"DOCTOR: It's as simple as this. Someone has to get to the spacecraft,"
1506,"find out what sort of propulsion unit it has, and bring the information"
1507,"back to you, or we can't use the ioniser. Now, who better than me? "
1508,"CLENT: I've come to regard you as Penley's replacement, and. All right,"
1509,all right. But it's strictly under protest. 
1510,DOCTOR: Thank you. 
1511,GARRETT: How will you get the information back to us? 
1512,DOCTOR: Ah. Now I don't suppose you have a small radio transmitter? 
1513,"CLENT: No, our video links are the only communicators available. Pure"
1514,sound is no longer in use. 
1515,"DOCTOR: Oh. Well, you won't see me, but you'll hear me. As soon as I"
1516,get to the glacier face I'll switch it on and you'll overhear. I hope. 
1517,GARRETT: Is that all you're taking? 
1518,"DOCTOR: Why, what else do I need? "
1519,CLENT; But the Warriors are armed. 
1520,DOCTOR: But I'm not going to fight a duel. 
1521,GARRETT: But you must be in a position to defend yourself. They'll try
1522,to kill you out of hand. 
1523,"DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think so. This is my defence. "
1524,CLENT: But how can you rely on that? They've already proved themselves
1525,to be utterly ruthless. 
1526,DOCTOR: I think they'll listen to me. 
1527,GARRETT: You mean you're going to let them take you prisoner? 
1528,DOCTOR: That is exactly what I'm going to do.

1533,deeper into the glacier maze. But it catches up to her again. Victoria
1534,screams and runs into what seems to be a dead end. She breaks through a

1536,just manages to hide as the ice warrior makes the hole big enough for
1537,"itself to walk through and past her, almost treading on the"

1547,STORR: Then why you looking so worried?

1549,"STORR: Aye, scientifically designed, of course. "

1571,"PENLEY: These warriors are not of our time, nor of this planet. "

1577,JAMIE: A loyalist.

1680,VICTORIA: I run away and the warrior caught me. The ice fell 
1681,STORR: You ran away? But why? 
1682,"VICTORIA: The warriors, they're evil. They killed Arden. I think they"
1683,want to destroy the base. 
1684,STORR: They are against the scientists? 
1685,"VICTORIA: I know, but they won't listen. They think the ioniser is a"

1715,enough for me.

1736,"STORR: Oh, well, I know the land around here. I've lived here all my"
1737,life. 
1738,"VARGA: You are not a scientist, only a local native. "
1739,ZONDAL: Useless and unnecessary. 
1740,"STORR: But, but I want to help you. "
1741,(Varga and Zondal fire their wrist guns and kill Storr.) 
1742,VARGA: Now to question the girl.
1743,
1744, [Plant museum]
1745,
1746,"DOCTOR: Yes, there we are. "
1747,"JAMIE: It's good to see you again, Doctor. "
1748,"DOCTOR: Ah, won't be long before you're on your feet again, Jamie. "
1749,JAMIE: How long? 
1750,"DOCTOR: Well, that depends. You've had some sort of shock to your"
1751,brain. It's affected your nervous system. 
1752,JAMIE: I will walk again though? 
1753,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes, of course you will. It's just a matter of time, that's"
1754,all. 
1755,"JAMIE: Aye, well I'll take your word on that. "
1756,PENLEY: What can we do for him? 
1757,DOCTOR: Well the base is the only place he can be treated. 
1758,"PENLEY: Yes I know that, but he can't get there alone. "
1759,(A pane of glass breaks and ice falls in.) 
1760,PENLEY: That's the glacier. It's moving forward even faster. 
1761,DOCTOR: Yes. It'll flatten this place in no time at all. 
1762,PENLEY: All right. I'll help you take him back. 
1763,"DOCTOR: Well, that's just it, you see. I can't go. There's something I"
1764,must do. 
1765,PENLEY: You don't expect me to face Clent alone? That mouth piece of
1766,the computer? He's got a printed circuit where his heart should be. 
1767,DOCTOR: He's a man with a mission. I don't think he can afford to
1768,reject you. 
1769,"PENLEY: Well, that's not the point. Anyway, what are you going to do? "
1770,DOCTOR: I must speak with the warriors. 
1771,"JAMIE: No, Doctor! "
1772,PENLEY: What can you do alone? 
1773,"DOCTOR: I have to see whether Victoria got away safely, and I must find"
1774,out whether this spacecraft is a danger to the ionisation programme. I
1775,admit it won't be easy. 
1776,"JAMIE: Doctor, if you go to the warriors you'll be their prisoner. "
1777,"DOCTOR: Their guest I hope, Jamie."

1779, [Ioniser control room]
1780,
1781,"CLENT: Look, Miss Garrett, look. The glacier"
1782,moving. That's the fifth surge today. The ioniser just isn't holding it
1783,anymore. 
1784,GARRETT: But we daren't increase power beyond the minimal. 
1785,"CLENT: Well, I know the risk if the spaceship explodes. Cobalt"
1786,radioactivity level. We'd only replace one disaster with an even
1787,greater one. 
1788,GARRETT: But you must make a decision soon. 
1789,CLENT: No decision to be made yet. Computer can act only when given
1790,adequate information. We still don't know enough about the alien
1791,reactor. 
1792,GARRETT: But suppose we never know? Suppose the Doctor never returns? 
1793,CLENT: We'll face that if and when we have to. 
1794,"GARRETT: But you must have a plan in mind, surely? "
1795,CLENT: I'm pinning all my hopes on the Doctor. He must succeed. 
1796,"DOCTOR : Here we go, Clent old chap. Wish me luck."

1800,(There is more ice falling as the Doctor arrives
1801,outside the spaceship. He knocks on the entrance hatch.) 
1802,DOCTOR: Anyone at home? 
1803,(The Doctor sees the weapon by the hatch. It comes out of the bulkhead
1804,so the Doctor ducks underneath it and returns to the hatch.) 
1805,"DOCTOR: Open up. Come on. Open up, I say! Very well, I shall count to"
1806,"ten. One, two, three. Ah! "
1807,[Airlock]
1808,
1809,(The hatch opens and the Doctor marches in.) 
1810,VARGA : Who are you? 
1811,DOCTOR: I never answer questions until I'm addressed properly. 
1812,VARGA : You will answer now. Very well. You are standing in
1813,the airlock of this spacecraft. Unless you answer my questions within
1814,"ten seconds, I will take atmospheric pressure around you down to zero. "
1815,DOCTOR: But if you do that my body will explode. 
1816,"VARGA: One, two, three, four "
1817,(The pressure gauge on the wall drops rapidly.)

1821,
1822,"DOCTOR: All right, all right! I don't think much of"
1823,your hospitality. 
1824,VARGA : Identify yourself. 
1825,DOCTOR: Me? I'm a scientist. I've come to talk with you.
1826,
1827, [Spacecraft]
1828,
1829,DOCTOR : To help you. 
1830,VARGA: A scientist? 
1831,"DOCTOR : Yes. Yes, you could call me that. "
1832,ZONDAL: You do not look like a scientist. 
1833,"DOCTOR : Looks aren't everything, you know. "
1834,VARGA: You look more like a scavenger. We killed him. 
1835,"DOCTOR : Well if you kill me, you'll ruin any chance you"
1836,may have of escape. 
1837,ZONDAL: Do you think he can help us? 
1838,VARGA: He cannot afford to lie. Allow him to enter. 
1839,(The Doctor enters.) 
1840,"DOCTOR: Ah, thank you very much. That's very civil of you. Oh, my word!"
1841,
1842,(The Doctor tries to leave but the door has shut.) 
1843,VARGA: You claim to be able to help us. 
1844,"DOCTOR: No, I am sure I can help you. On certain conditions. "
1845,VARGA: You are our prisoner. It is we who set conditions. 
1846,(The spacecraft shakes.) 
1847,"DOCTOR: On the contrary, it is you who are the prisoner, and I can help"
1848,you. 
1849,VARGA: Not on your terms. Bring in the girl. Now we will have two
1850,hostages. 
1851,"DOCTOR: Well, what good will that do? You are buried alive in the heart"
1852,of this glacier. Time is desperately short. You've got no time to
1853,bargain over hostages. 
1854,"VARGA: Inside our spaceship, we are safe. And with you here, your base"
1855,will dare not use their secret weapon against us. 
1856,DOCTOR: Weapon? But the ioniser is not a weapon. 
1857,VARGA: You know how it works? 
1858,"DOCTOR: Yes, of course. It'll melt the ice and set you free! "
1859,VICTORIA: You're hurting me! 
1860,DOCTOR: Victoria! 
1861,"VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor! Oh dear, but they've got you too. "
1862,DOCTOR: It's all right. We are not beaten yet. 
1863,VICTORIA: What about Jamie? 
1864,DOCTOR: He's alive. 
1865,"VARGA: If what you say is true, why have you not freed us before? "
1866,"DOCTOR: Well, there are difficulties. "
1867,VARGA: What are they? 
1868,DOCTOR: Well. 
1869,VARGA: You will tell us.

1872,(Wolves howl as Penley drags Jamie on a travois
1873,through the remains of a forest. It gets stuck.) 
1874,"PENLEY: You're caught on a bough or something. Well, it's not much"
1875,"farther now, lad. "
1876,JAMIE: How far are we? 
1877,"PENLEY: Well, we're at the edge of the woods fringing the camp"
1878,perimeter. 
1879,JAMIE: Can we not rest a while? 
1880,"PENLEY: I think so, but a couple of minutes, no more. "
1881,"JAMIE: Aye, you're right. The Doctor needs help right away. "
1882,PENLEY: I wasn't thinking only of the Doctor. 
1883,JAMIE: Wolves. 
1884,"PENLEY: Yes. Here we're more or less safe, but the last stretch is open"
1885,country. 
1886,"JAMIE: I don't help much, do I? "
1887,"PENLEY: Well, I'm not exactly a man of action myself. Storr should be"
1888,here now. I miss him. 
1889,JAMIE: Have you no weapons? 
1890,"PENLEY: Arden's tranquilliser gun, that's all. "
1891,"JAMIE: Aye, it's not much. "
1892,PENLEY: Storr was a huntsman. An expert with a bow and arrow. 
1893,JAMIE: It's no good wishing. 
1894,"PENLEY: Well, I'd better carry on. "
1895,"JAMIE: Aye, lead on McDuff. "
1896,(A bear comes through the trees.) 
1897,PENLEY: Keep very still.
1898,
1899, [Spacecraft]
1900,
1901,VARGA: So you are afraid of us. 
1902,"DOCTOR: No, but of your ship. If the ioniser sets off a nuclear"
1903,"holocaust, it will all have be in vain. "
1904,VARGA: That is good. In that case you dare not act. 
1905,ZONDAL: But if you thought there would be no explosion? 
1906,VARGA: Well? 
1907,"DOCTOR: Well, in that case we'd have no choice. "
1908,VARGA: You would use the ioniser. 
1909,DOCTOR: But it wouldn't harm the ship. It would release it. 
1910,ZONDAL: There would be floods. 
1911,VARGA: Our engines would be useless. 
1912,ZONDAL: We would be at your mercy. 
1913,VARGA: Why did you come here? 
1914,ZONDAL: To spy? To betray us? 
1915,VARGA: But you could not hope to escape to tell the tale. 
1916,"DOCTOR: Oh, I always live in hope. "
1917,VARGA: You have some kind of communicator. 
1918,"DOCTOR: You do realise, don't you, that after a certain point, my base"
1919,will 
1920, [Ioniser control room]
1921,
1922,DOCTOR : Have to activate the ioniser
1923,regardless of the consequences? 
1924,VARGA : And destroy you and themselves as well?
1925,
1926, [Spacecraft]
1927,
1928,DOCTOR: Is that what would happen? 
1929,VARGA: Give it to me. 
1930,(The Doctor gives Varga the communicator.) 
1931,"VARGA: Ah, they would never know."
1932,
1933, [Ioniser control room]
1934,
1935,VARGA : They would never know. 
1936,GARRETT: The Doctor. You heard what he said. 
1937,"CLENT: Regardless of the consequences. Yes. Yes, he's telling us to"
1938,take the risk. 
1939,GARRETT: But we can't give the computer the information it needs. It
1940,can't instruct us. 
1941,CLENT: Can the ioniser hold? 
1942,GARRETT: At present power it's steadily losing ground. But we dare not
1943,increase. 
1944,COMPUTER: Summary of orders to all World Ioniser Stations. The new
1945,equation originated from Brittanicus Base will be adopted to conditions
1946,prevailing in each sector. All bases will prepare to use full ioniser
1947,attack on the ice in concerted action. Zero hour in six hours exactly.
1948,Report readiness one hour. 
1949,CLENT: We can't do it. 
1950,GARRETT: But if we don't the whole plan must fail. 
1951,"CLENT: But if we act and there is an explosion, apart from destroying"
1952,this base the contamination could easily 
1953,"GARRETT: We must state our problem to World Control, now. "
1954,"CLENT: No, wait! We'll give our computer all the information we have. "
1955,GARRETT: It isn't enough. 
1956,CLENT: It may be. It may be. 
1957,GARRETT: I know what the computer will say. 
1958,"CLENT: No, no, no, no, no. Let the computer speak for itself. "
1959,GARRETT: There's only one answer it can give. 
1960,"CLENT: Come on, quickly. Put the situation to the computer. Do as"
1961,you're told!
1962,
1963,[Snowfield]
1964,
1965,PENLEY: He's sizing us up. 
1966,JAMIE: Can you not run for it? 
1967,"PENLEY: I don't intend to leave you here as hors d'oeuvre, laddie. "
1968,"JAMIE: Well, the gun. Use the gun. "
1969,"PENLEY: I couldn't hit the side of the mountain. I'm a scientist, not a"
1970,gladiator. 
1971,"JAMIE: Well, at least you can try. "
1972,"PENLEY: All right. Well, cross your fingers. Here goes. "
1973,(Penley fires and the bear comes towards them.) 
1974,"JAMIE: Quick, get me out of here. I'll tackle him. Get a hold of"
1975,"yourself, man. "
1976,PENLEY: He's charging now! 
1977,"JAMIE: Quick, he's nearly on us! "

1982,COMPUTER: Set up all circuits to new equation and
1983,wait. Further information essential before decision can be taken.
1984,Prepare to notify World Control in event of emergency. 
1985,"CLENT: Of course, the computer's right. We must be prepared, and we"
1986,must wait. 
1987,GARRETT: It is the answer I expected. 
1988,"CLENT: But you don't realise why it made this choice, do you? "
1989,GARRETT: Because it is the most logical answer in the circumstances. 
1990,"CLENT: Of course. And because it's so logical, it can't gamble. It"
1991,can't take risks. 
1992,GARRETT: That is its function. To be totally impartial. To serve the
1993,community. 
1994,"CLENT: Exactly. And one more aim in its life, to survive. "
1995,GARRETT: It has given us its decision. 
1996,"CLENT: It is no decision. The computer is playing for time. Now listen,"
1997,all of you! We risk destruction either by a radioactive explosion or by
1998,the slow grind of the glaciers. Now there you see that the ice has
1999,advanced one hundred metres today. Now either way 
2000,GARRETT: The computer is destroyed. 
2001,"CLENT: So that, by demanding a decision, we are asking it to commit"
2002,suicide. 
2003,GARRETT: It can't do that! 
2004,CLENT: Then what is the answer? 
2005,GARRETT: We can escape. There's still time to evacuate. 
2006,CLENT: Perhaps you could face world opinionata. I couldn't. 
2007,GARRETT: You must notify World Control eventually. The other bases will
2008,be waiting. 
2009,CLENT: I will decide exactly when. For now we do as the computer says.
2010,"Prepare the ioniser and wait. Now, complete data check please, Miss"
2011,"Garrett. Miss Curtis, report to me the moment marker four reaches one"
2012,"five oh oh. One three seven nine, now. Well, what do you feel about all"
2013,"this, Walters? Bet you didn't think you'd have ice monsters and things"
2014,"like that to deal with when you volunteered for the job, did you? Well,"
2015,did you? 
2016,WALTERS: I didn't volunteer.

2022,PENLEY: If I can get out from under this brute I will be. 
2023,JAMIE: You sure you're all right? 
2024,"PENLEY: Well he's clawed me, that's all. "

2030,"DOCTOR: It's an ion reactor, isn't it? Hmm. It could be dangerous, but"
2031,it wouldn't
2032,necessarily explode. 
2033,VARGA: True. But your friends do not know that. 
2034,DOCTOR: Now why don't you let us help you? 
2035,VARGA: We can get what we want without your help. 
2036,"DOCTOR: But what else do you need, apart from escaping from the ice? "
2037,VARGA: We have had enough of your questions. Now you will give me
2038,answers. 
2039,"DOCTOR: Well, I've told you all I can about the ioniser. "
2040,VARGA: That is only a toy. The base. What is its power source? 
2041,DOCTOR: Why on earth do you want to know that? 
2042,VARGA: Answer. 
2043,"DOCTOR: Oh, so that's what you need, is it? "
2044,ZONDAL: Answer the Commander's questions. 
2045,(Zondal has his gun at Victoria's head) 
2046,DOCTOR: Fuel! Fuel for your reactor! And suppose I don't tell you? 
2047,VARGA: The girl dies now. 
2048,"VICTORIA: Doctor, don't tell them. "
2049,"DOCTOR: Yes, you'll find what you need at the base. "
2050,VICTORIA: You shouldn't have! 
2051,DOCTOR: But you won't find Leader Clent easy to persuade. He's a very
2052,obstinate man. 
2053,VARGA: He will listen to our sonic cannon. 
2054,"ZONDAL: We must act quickly, Commander. "
2055,"VARGA: Isbur and Rintan, wait for me at the entrance to the cave."
2056,"Zondal, you will man the sonic gun. "

2070,CLENT: What? 
2071,"PENLEY : Clent, I must talk to you. I have news of the"

2081,GARRETT: What's wrong? 
2082,CLENT: Penley's come back. 
2083,GARRETT: Of his own choice? 
2084,CLENT: Apparently. 
2085,GARRETT: But why? 
2086,CLENT: We shall soon see. If he tries to start any trouble 
2087,"GARRETT: Well, he can't be allowed to interfere with the programme. Not"
2088,at this stage. 
2089,CLENT: No. I no longer need to be tolerant with him because he's no
2090,longer my equal. He's an outsider. 
2091,(Walters and Penley carry Jamie in.) 
2092,WALTERS: Come on then. 
2093,PENLEY: Put him over here. 
2094,WALTERS: Take it easy.

2096,JAMIE: Thank you. 
2097,"WALTERS: All right there, lad? "
2098,JAMIE: Thank you. 
2099,"CLENT: No, stay, Walters. You may be needed. "
2100,PENLEY: I'm not liable to be violent. 
2101,(Penley hands over his little weapon.) 
2102,CLENT: What do you want? 
2103,"PENLEY: Well, I brought this lad. He's in desperate need of medical"
2104,supervision. 
2105,GARRETT: We are not a first-aid centre. 
2106,PENLEY: He's paralysed. 
2107,CLENT: How did it happen? 
2108,PENLEY: He was shot down by the warrior's guns. 
2109,"CLENT: Well, thank heaven their weapons don't deal fatal blows. "
2110,PENLEY: Well they killed Arden. 
2111,"JAMIE: Look, you've got to help. "
2112,"CLENT: Yes of course, boy. Walters will take you to the Medi-Control"
2113,Centre. 
2114,"JAMIE: No, I didn't mean me. I meant Victoria and the Doctor. Look,"
2115,they're inside the alien spaceship. You've got to help them! 
2116,CLENT: That isn't possible. 
2117,JAMIE: Well it must be. You've got to do something. 
2118,"CLENT: No, we lost contact with the Doctor over an hour ago. I'm afraid"
2119,there's no hope. 
2120,PENLEY: You mean hope happens to be inconvenient. You've got to stick
2121,"to your precious schedule, is that it? You've got to wave your splendid"
2122,ioniser about to prove that it works and never mind about human beings.
2123,
2124,GARRETT: The computer has decided. 
2125,PENLEY: The computer? Override it. Let the ioniser wait. The computer
2126,isn't going to fall apart because it has to mark time for an hour. 
2127,CLENT: We are marking time. We're not using the ioniser under
2128,instructions from the computer itself. 
2129,PENLEY: Why? 
2130,GARRETT: The spaceship may contain a reactor system that could wipe us
2131,off this island if we cause it to explode. 
2132,PENLEY: So what are you going to do? 
2133,CLENT: We obey the computer. We will wait. 
2134,PENLEY: Wait? But that's suicide. The glacier's practically on top of
2135,us. 
2136,CLENT: We still have time in hand. 
2137,"JAMIE: Yes, but if the Doctor, if he's still "
2138,CLENT: No. 
2139,"PENLEY: If the Doctor doesn't contact you, then what hope is there? "
2140,CLENT: There is hope. 
2141,"PENLEY: Oh don't be a fool, Clent. You're not a man, you're just a"
2142,machine slave. 
2143,"CLENT: Don't you spit your stupid liberty in my face, Penley. We know"
2144,"your kind of freedom. Freedom to run away from responsibilities, from"
2145,"service, from moral judgement. I may be a physical coward, Penley, but"
2146,you're a coward in the mind. 
2147,PENLEY: Well at least I have a mind and not a transistorised junction
2148,"box. I would act, but you daren't. And so you're going to be destroyed"
2149,along with your mechanical master. 
2150,"JAMIE: Look, you've got to help us, man. "
2151,"PENLEY: Jamie, I don't think you're "
2152,(Jamie takes hold of Clent's arm. Clent starts shouting and Walters
2153,enters and shoots Penley and Jamie.) 
2154,"CLENT: There! Now, get them out of here! "
2155,GARRETT: You'd better take them to the Medi-Control Centre. Get someone
2156,to look at the boy. Make sure there's a guard for when they come to. 
2157,WALTERS: Right. Send two guards to control. 
2158,CLENT: Penley. He's nothing. 
2159,"GARRETT: Our trust is in the great computer. With its aid, we cannot"
2160,fail.
2161,
2162, [Spacecraft]
2163,
2164,VARGA : I am now outside their base.
2165,"Stand by, gun control. Take target readings. "
2166,(The sonic gun protrudes from the ship's hull again.) 
2167,ZONDAL: Ready. Vertical bearing minus point nine. Lateral bearing three
2168,five. 
2169,(The cross hairs are now in the centre of the dome.) 
2170,ZONDAL: Prepare to charge to frequency three five. 
2171,WARRIOR : Frequency three five. 
2172,(The Doctor gestures Victoria to cry.) 
2173,"DOCTOR: It's all right Victoria, don't cry. It's all right. There's"
2174,nothing to be afraid of. 
2175,ZONDAL: Wait until Varga returns triumphant. Then you will have cause
2176,to cry. 
2177,"DOCTOR: Come along, Victoria, blow. Blow. "
2178,(The Doctor makes the nose-blowing sound.) 
2179,"DOCTOR: That's better, that's better. (sotto) We can try and escape"
2180,with this. 
2181,VICTORIA: (sotto) What is it? 
2182,DOCTOR: (sotto) Ammonium sulphide. 
2183,VICTORIA: (sotto) Ammonium sulphide? It's only a stink bomb. 
2184,"DOCTOR: (sotto) Yes, you've had the benefits of a classical education."
2185,"Yes, it is what you'd call a stink bomb. "
2186,VICTORIA: (sotto) What use is that? 
2187,"DOCTOR: (sotto) You'd be surprised. Harmless to humans, but to aliens"
2188,very possibly deadly! 
2189,"ZONDAL: The gun is fully ready, Commander. "
2190,"VARGA : Good, Zondal. We will now contact the scientists."
2191,On my command you will fire once. Do you understand? 
2192,"ZONDAL: Yes, Commander. "
2193,VARGA : Good. 
2194,"VICTORIA: Zondal. Zondal, look! "
2195,ZONDAL: What is it? 
2196,VICTORIA: Look! 
2197,ZONDAL: Do not try any tricks. 
2198,(Victoria points to the bottom of the airlock door as the Doctor sneaks
2199,up behind Zondal.) 
2200,"VICTORIA: There's, there's water, seeping into the ship. Just there. "
2201,DOCTOR: I can't get it undone. 
2202,"VICTORIA: Look, over in the corner there. "
2203,(Victoria goes to help the Doctor.) 
2204,VICTORIA: Let me. 
2205,ZONDAL: You tricked me. There is no water. What is that? Let me have
2206,it. Give it to me at once. 
2207,VARGA : Zondal. 
2208,(Victoria throws the ammonium sulphate into Zondal's face.) 
2209,"VARGA : Zondal, fire. Fire now. Zondal, fire. Zondal fire."
2210,Fire now. 
2211,(Zondal tries to reach the firing switch as he collapses. The Doctor
2212,struggles to keep his hand away from it.)

2214,
2215, [Ioniser control room]
2216,
2217,GARRETT: Co-ordinates for area red one. Oh oh eight
2218,"one nine three vertical, eight five eight one eight oh lateral."
2219,Parallel lateral shift. Controls are set. 
2220,CLENT: (unintelligible under the rising sound of the ioniser.) 
2221,(The chandelier drops part way and ceiling plaster falls.) 
2222,WALTERS: The records wing! It's gone! It's demolished! 
2223,CLENT: We're under attack! Report! 
2224,"VARGA : Leader Clent, surrender or die! "
2225,CLENT: What in the blazes? 
2226,VARGA ; Surrender now or I will blast your base to
2227,fragments. 
2228,"CLENT: No, I refuse! You can't destroy us! "
2229,VARGA : You do not believe me? Very well. Must I fire
2230,again? 
2231,GARRETT: We must play for time. 
2232,"WALTERS: The building won't stand much more of this bombardment, sir. "
2233,CLENT: Then we must talk. Who am I addressing? 
2234,VARGA : My name is Varga. Do you surrender? 
2235,"CLENT: Now frankly, you'll gain nothing by destroying us, Varga. We"
2236,both have urgent needs. I will agree to talk but nothing more. 
2237,VARGA : No treachery. If I come in peace there must be
2238,trust between us. 
2239,"CLENT: Very well. There will be no traps, or conditions. "
2240,"VARGA : See that you keep to that, for if you lie. "
2241,(Transmission ends.) 
2242,GARRETT: What does he want? 
2243,"WALTERS: Our guards won't stand a chance against weapons like that,"
2244,sir. 
2245,"CLENT: You heard what he said. No treachery, only trust. "
2246,GARRETT: But can we trust him? 
2247,CLENT: I'm afraid we have to. He's got the best argument on his side.
2248,"That gun, or whatever it is. "
2249,GARRETT: We can bluff him though. 
2250,CLENT: How? 
2251,GARRETT: He doesn't know the computer's command to wait. We can
2252,threaten to destroy the glacier and his ship with it. 
2253,"CLENT: Yes, yes. Yes possibly. "
2254,"WALTERS: Well why can't we do it, sir? It's our only chance for"
2255,survival. 
2256,GARRETT: You know the computers decision and its reasons. 
2257,WALTERS: I know all about that. But it doesn't exactly give much
2258,"thought to us, does it? "
2259,"GARRETT: The computer thinks of everything, considers all the facts. "
2260,"WALTERS: And it's supposed to come up with all the answers, isn't it?"
2261,"Well, a fat lot of good it's doing us now. Wait, it says, wait! With"
2262,"glaciers on the one hand, and warriors on the other! Well, what price"
2263,your computer now. 
2264,CLENT: Walters! 
2265,"WALTERS: What we need is someone like Penley, or that Doctor. Somebody"
2266,who can think. Not with a machine. And what good's your precious
2267,computer done anyway? Nothing! Nothing but trouble! And it's time
2268,somebody put a stop to it. 
2269,"(Walters raises his arms to smash a panel with a piece of debris, and"
2270,Garrett shoots him.)
2271,
2272, [Spacecraft]
2273,
2274,VICTORIA: That's Varga's voice. 
2275,DOCTOR: Shush. 
2276,VARGA : We are going in now. 
2277,VICTORIA: We must escape. 
2278,"DOCTOR: It's not just a question of escape, Victoria. We've got to take"
2279,some action. It's this gun that's given Varga control of the base.
2280,Without it he'd be helpless. 
2281,VICTORIA: What can we do? 
2282,(The Doctor opens up a panel by the gun control.)
2283,
2284, [Ioniser control room]
2285,
2286,(Three ice warriors enter.) 
2287,"CLENT: Well now, gentlemen, you said no traps and we for our part have"
2288,"made utterly sure, that there are no traps "
2289,VARGA: I made no promises. I merely warned you not to trick me. 
2290,GARRETT: How can we help you? 
2291,VARGA: I will tell you what I want and you will give it to me. 
2292,"CLENT: Oh, come now, Varga. That's not the way to talk. We're both of"
2293,us in a very difficult situation and at times like this it beholds us
2294,"both to proceed with mutual respect and, because the whole world could"
2295,be 
2296,(Walters has woken and is reaching for his weapon. An ice warrior kills
2297,him.) 
2298,VARGA: So much for your word. 
2299,"CLENT: That was, that was not planned. "
2300,VARGA: I have one major requirement. The mercury isotopes for my ships
2301,reactor. You will give them to me. 
2302,CLENT: But we don't use mercury isotopes. 
2303,VARGA: The Doctor stated that you had them here. 
2304,"CLENT: Well, he was wrong. We have none. "
2305,VARGA: You are lying. 
2306,CLENT: What good will it do me? 
2307,VARGA: Tell me what will happen if we halted your reactor in order to
2308,remove the fuel elements we need. 
2309,GARRETT: You can't do that! 
2310,VARGA: Why? 
2311,"CLENT: That reactor gives us light, heat and power. "
2312,GARRETT: And it powers the ioniser. 
2313,"VARGA: So that without it, you would be completely helpless. "
2314,CLENT: In Arctic conditions like these we'd soon perish. 
2315,VARGA: Whereas we would not. 
2316,CLENT: You'd be wasting your time. This reactor does not use mercury. 
2317,VARGA: I do not believe you. 
2318,CLENT: But you must.
2319,
2320, [Spacecraft]
2321,
2322,VARGA : There is only one way to find
2323,out. Where are the reactor controls? Tell me now. 
2324,VICTORIA: Did you hear that? Making them shut down the reactor. 
2325,DOCTOR: Yes. Now this is Varga's main weapon. There's just a chance
2326,that I can turn it against him. 
2327,VICTORIA: What? 
2328,DOCTOR: If I can open these doors. There we are. Come on. 
2329, [Glacier cave]
2330,
2331,DOCTOR: Now careful. Just stay there. How does this
2332,gun operate? 
2333,"VICTORIA: Oh, hurry, Doctor, hurry."
2334,
2335, [Ioniser control room]
2336,
2337,CLENT: You've got to believe me! 
2338,VARGA: So you say. 
2339,"CLENT: Listen, Varga, the power source is locked in directly with the"
2340,"ioniser. Now if we cut the power before it is safe, the feedback effect"
2341,could blast this building into a state of ion flux. 
2342,VARGA: What's its temperature range? 
2343,CLENT: It can melt rock. Don't interfere with it! It's fully primed. 
2344,VARGA: It can melt rock. What a weapon. 
2345,GARRETT: It is not a weapon. It is a scientific instrument. 
2346,VARGA: I see it differently. 
2347,CLENT: It's still a highly dangerous machine. 
2348,VARGA: Then run is carefully down to safety level. But no tricks. You
2349,do it now. 
2350,GARRETT: It will take some time. 
2351,VARGA: Does it matter? You dare not use it anyway. 
2352,CLENT: What? 
2353,VARGA: Your Doctor friend talked. I know your fear of my spaceship.
2354,That it will explode if the heat is too great. 
2355,CLENT: Would it? 
2356,VARGA: Close it down or you die. 
2357,CLENT: She's the only person qualified to disconnect the ioniser
2358,safely. 
2359,VARGA: What are your qualifications for existence? 
2360,CLENT: I'm the leader here. 
2361,"VARGA: You have less value to me than your colleague, who has certain"
2362,skills. 
2363,CLENT: But she doesn't know everything. I have the answers that you
2364,require. 
2365,"VARGA: I know all I need to know. If I killed you, it would be no great"
2366,loss to me. 
2367,"GARRETT: No, please! "
2368,VARGA: Then you will do as I say. Run down the machine as quickly as is
2369,safely possible. No more tricks. At once. 
2370, [Glacier cave]
2371,
2372,(The Doctor has got into the gun's circuitry.) 
2373,VICTORIA: What is it you're trying to do? 
2374,"DOCTOR: Well, it's a little difficult to explain, Victoria. Oh. Oh"
2375,"dear. Hold this for me, will you? This gun works on the basis that"
2376,sound waves produce reverberations in the objects in their path. 
2377,"VICTORIA: The objects vibrate in sympathy. Well, I know. My father told"
2378,me once. 
2379,"DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. Well if you can produce unsympathetic"
2380,"vibrations, damage results. "
2381,"VICTORIA: Damage? Oh, like a singer breaking glass. "
2382,DOCTOR: Yes. But I want to be able to get at the warriors without it
2383,"affecting the scientists too much. Now, if we change this to frequency"
2384,seven. 
2385,VICTORIA: What will that do? 
2386,"DOCTOR: Well, primarily it affects fluids. "
2387,VICTORIA: What good is that to us? 
2388,"DOCTOR: Well, I believe that Varga and his warriors have a far greater"
2389,fluid content than human beings. There. 
2390,"VICTORIA: If it works, what happens? "
2391,DOCTOR: That's just it. I don't know. 
2392,"VICTORIA: Oh now look, Doctor. "
2393,"DOCTOR: But I do know that whatever effect it has on the scientists,"
2394,it'll have a far greater one on the warriors. 
2395,[Spacecraft]
2396,
2397,"VICTORIA: Well, how's that? "
2398,"DOCTOR: Well, apart from the fluid question, their helmets will trap"
2399,and intensify the soundwaves. 
2400,"VICTORIA: You mean, it'll knock them out and leave the scientists a bit"
2401,"dizzy. Well, is that it? "
2402,"DOCTOR: Well, that's what I'm hoping, but there is just a vague risk"
2403,that it'll kill everybody. Clent and Penley included. 
2404,VICTORIA: And Jamie?
2405,
2406, [Medi-control centre]
2407,
2408,(Jamie and Penley are lying on trolleys. Penley
2409,"wakes and checks Jamie, then leaves. Jamie wakes.)"
2410,
2411, [Ioniser control room]
2412,
2413,GARRETT: It's done. 
2414,VARGA: It is safe now? 
2415,GARRETT: Yes. Just ticking over. Not even holding the ice in check at
2416,all. 
2417,"VARGA: Disconnect it completely, now. Now we must move quickly, before"
2418,the glacial surge does too much damage. 
2419,"CLENT: You'll regret this, Varga. "
2420,"VARGA: At least I will live to regret it. Now, the reactor. Shut it"
2421,"down, quickly. "
2422,(Penley is watching through the open doorway. He crosses to the
2423,thermostat in the corridor.) 
2424,"PENLEY: Perfectly at home in ice age conditions. Well, we'll soon"
2425,change all that. 
2426,"(Penley moves temperature to maximum, oxygen to minimum and humidity to"
2427,maximum.) 
2428,VARGA: Shut it down at once. The heat. What is happening? There is
2429,something wrong. 
2430,(A heat haze rises.) 
2431,VARGA: You are trying to trick me again. For that you will die.
2432,
2433,[Spacecraft]
2434,
2435,"VICTORIA: No, no, no. It's too dangerous! "
2436,"DOCTOR: It's a risk we must take, Victoria! "
2437,VICTORIA: Oh! 
2438,"DOCTOR: Now, cross your fingers. Here we go. "
2439, [Ioniser control room]
2440,
2441,"(The sonic gun is fired, and everyone clutches"
2442,their head in pain. Clent screams. The ice warriors beat at their
2443,helmets as the humans pass out.)
2444,
2445, [Spacecraft]
2446,
2447,"DOCTOR: Varga, this is the Doctor. Are you going to"
2448,"retreat, or shall I fire again? The trouble is I dare not use it again."
2449,"If it hasn't killed them all already, another firing most certainly"
2450,will. Varga! Answer me or I fire again!
2451,
2452, [Outside the Ioniser control room]
2453,
2454,(The ice warriors stagger out.) 
2455,VARGA: You will die for this. 
2456, [Spacecraft]
2457,
2458,VICTORIA: What are you doing now? 
2459,"DOCTOR: Get well back, Victoria. "
2460,VICTORIA: What? 
2461,DOCTOR: Stand by for fireworks. Here we go. 
2462,(The Doctor touches two wires together and the sonic gun control panel
2463,explodes.) 
2464,"DOCTOR: Now, quickly. Let's get out of here before they come back."
2465,"(Later, while all the humans are still out cold, Zondal wakes.) "
2466,VARGA: The gun is useless.
2467,
2468, [Outside the Ioniser control room]
2469,
2470,"DOCTOR: Victoria, see if you can find Jamie. "
2471,"VICTORIA: Doctor, Jamie's in there. He's alive! "
2472,"DOCTOR: Oh thank goodness for that. Now you get back to the Tardis, and"
2473,close the doors. 
2474,(The Doctor waves the remains of the ammonium sulphate under Penley's
2475,nose. It wakes him.) 
2476,DOCTOR: Sorry about that. Up you get. Come along. 
2477,PENLEY: What happened? Did you do that? 
2478,DOCTOR: No time for questions. Come along. 
2479, [Spacecraft]
2480,
2481,"VARGA: So, you allowed them to trick you. "
2482,"ZONDAL: I await your punishment, Commander. "
2483,VARGA: We have no time. Everything depends on being ready to break free
2484,from the ice as soon as they evaporate it.
2485,
2486, [Ioniser control room]
2487,
2488,"DOCTOR: Up you get. Come along, Miss Garrett. There"
2489,you are. 
2490,"GARRETT: Oh, the ioniser. They made me disconnect it. "
2491,DOCTOR: Then it must be switched on again immediately. 
2492,GARRETT: I don't take orders from you. 
2493,"CLENT: Miss Garrett, if we are to obey Computer Control, it must be"
2494,"reconnected. Do so, please. "
2495,"GARRETT: Yes, of course. "
2496,"DOCTOR: Clent, their spacecraft is powered by an ion reactor. "
2497,"CLENT: Well, that means we dare not use the ioniser at full force."
2498,That's our last chance gone. 
2499,"PENLEY: Why, for heavens sake? "
2500,"CLENT: Because of the risk, man. You know what would happen. "
2501,"DOCTOR: Of course there's a risk, but it's a risk we must take. It's"
2502,the only way! 
2503,PENLEY: Exactly. 
2504,CLENT: The computer says no! 
2505,PENLEY: The computer 
2506,CLENT: Is our supreme advisor. 
2507,PENLEY: And what sort of advice is that. Do nothing? 
2508,GARRETT: We must obey! 
2509,PENLEY: And be destroyed? Has the computer considered that? 
2510,CLENT: The computer considers everything. 
2511,DOCTOR: But that's why in this case you cannot rely on its judgement! 
2512,GARRETT: We trust the computer. It is our strength and our guide. 
2513,DOCTOR: Not this time. 
2514,"JAMIE: Well, why not? "
2515,"DOCTOR: Because Jamie, the computer is faced with an insoluble problem."
2516,Either way it risks destroying itself and this it cannot do. It must
2517,play safe. 
2518,"JAMIE: Aye, but if it does nothing that's just as bad. "
2519,"DOCTOR: I'll explain to you another time, Jamie. "
2520,PENLEY: There's only one way out. 
2521,CLENT: What? 
2522,PENLEY: We must over-ride the computer. 
2523,GARRETT: You can't do that! 
2524,"PENLEY: We must. This is a decision for a man to take, not a machine."
2525,"The computer isn't designed to take risks, but that is the essence of"
2526,man's progress. We must decide. 
2527,CLENT: But if you do that you'll soon ruin the world plan. All the
2528,ioniser bases must act together through World Computer Control! If we
2529,act too soon it's as bad as being too late! 
2530,"PENLEY: Yes, I know that, but the other bases haven't got a glacier"
2531,right on top of them and apart from that what about these ice warriors?
2532,If they live they threaten our entire civilisation. 
2533,"DOCTOR: A decision must be taken, and quickly! "
2534,CLENT: I can't. 
2535,GARRETT: I daren't. 
2536,"DOCTOR: Penley, it's up to you. "
2537,"PENLEY: Well, Clent? "
2538,CLENT: I reserve the right to consult the computer. 
2539,PENLEY: Go ahead. 
2540,CLENT: Problem. Alien spacecraft is powered by an ion reactor. Dare we
2541,use the ioniser? What are the alternatives? Answer. 
2542,(The computer spins and gibbers.) 
2543,JAMIE: It's as though it's gone mad! 
2544,"DOCTOR: Well, Penley? "
2545,PENLEY: We will use the ioniser at full strength to turn back the
2546,"glacier. Miss Garrett, inform World Control. "
2547,"JAMIE: But the spaceship, if you release it from the ice? "
2548,PENLEY: At full strength the ioniser will melt rock.
2549,
2550, [Spaceship]
2551,
2552,"ZONDAL: Commander, the glacier is breaking up. Soon"
2553,we will be free. 
2554,VARGA: What use is our freedom if we are helpless? Our engines must
2555,still dead. 
2556,ZONDAL: I have not given up yet. 
2557,VARGA: Nor I. There must be some life left in the elements. 
2558,"ZONDAL: Commander, power. "
2559,VARGA: What? The ice is our friend. We still have power. 
2560,ZONDAL: Shall I increase it? 
2561,VARGA: Carefully. We must time full take-off boost perfectly. 
2562,"ZONDAL: And when we are free and in flight, we will be invincible."
2563,
2564, [Ioniser control room]
2565,
2566,CLENT: Instrument readings on the glacier face show
2567,a steady rise in temperature. Now near to maximum. 
2568,"JAMIE: Well, do will we know? "
2569,GARRETT: The instruments on the ice face have the highest heat and
2570,"shock resistance known to man. When they cease to function, everything"
2571,about them will be destroyed. 
2572,CLENT: You're wrong! You're wrong! We'll all be killed! 
2573,PENLEY: It is a risk I willingly take. 
2574,"(Penley slides the control down past generator, circuit lock, energy"
2575,feed to activator)

2577, [Spacecraft]
2578,
2579,(The spacecraft is full of smoke.) 
2580,"VARGA: It was not power in the engines, Zondal, it was heat. Heat from"
2581,the ioniser. 
2582,(The instruments burst into flames.)
2583,
2584, [Ioniser control room]
2585,
2586,(The seismograph shows a small blip.) 
2587,GARRETT: Only a minor explosion. We're safe!
