19,
20,(K9 is plugged into the underside of the console.) 
21,"DOCTOR: You ready, K9? "
22,K9: Master. 
23,DOCTOR: Right. I want you to set a course of binary coordinates ten
24,zero eleven zero zero by zero two from galactic zero centre. 
25,K9: Coordinates laid in. 
26,DOCTOR: Very good. 
27,K9: Spatial drive initiated. 
28,"DOCTOR: Well done, K9. Well, now we've dropped off our Earth friend we"
29,can be on our way. 
30,"ROMANA: You've made up your mind, then? "
31,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. We can't resist a summons to Gallifrey. Anyway, I'm so"
32,looking forward to seeing how Leela and Andred are getting on. You can
33,"meet your twin, K9. You know Romana, it. Romana? "
34,(Romana has gone into the Tardis's interior.) 
35,"DOCTOR: You stay there, K9. You're in charge. "
36,K9: Master.
37,
38, [Romana's room]
39,
40,(Romana is lying on her bed. The Doctor knocks on
41,the door then opens it. Romana is crying.) 
42,DOCTOR: Ahem. Do you mind if I come in? 
43,ROMANA: The Time Lords want me back. 
44,"DOCTOR: Yes. Well, you only came to help with the Key to Time. "
45,"ROMANA: Doctor, I don't want to spend the rest of my life on Gallifrey."
46,After all this. 
47,"DOCTOR: Well, you can't fight Time Lords, Romana. "
48,"ROMANA: You did, once. "
49,DOCTOR: Hmm. And lost. 
50,"ROMANA: Well, there's nothing more to discuss, then. We have to go. "
51,DOCTOR: I'm afraid so.
52,
53, [Tardis]
54,
55, K9: Course set and holding. ETA to Gallifrey
56,thirty two minutes. Flight path clear. Wait. Sensors indicate. No
57,vocabulary available. 
58,(The Tardis stops travelling and spins on the spot. It shimmers.) 
59,"K9: Cannot comprehend. Cannot, cannot comprehend. Cannot comprehend."
60,
61, [Romana's room]
62,
63,(The shimmering effect is everywhere.) 
64,"ROMANA: Doctor, what's happening? "
65,DOCTOR: I don't know.
66,
67, [Tardis]
68,
69, K9: I have lost control of the Tardis. 
70,(The shimmering stops and the Tardis whizzes on its way again. The
71,Doctor and Romana run in.) 
72,DOCTOR: K9! 
73,"K9: I have regained control, master. Tardis has stabilised. "
74,"ROMANA: Well, what happened, K9? "
75,"K9: Cannot explain, mistress. "
76,"DOCTOR: Never mind about that, just give me the data. "
77,K9: Cannot comply. 
78,DOCTOR: What? There must be some data. 
79,"K9: Substantial data was received, master, yes, however I am unable to"
80,assimilate it. 
81,"DOCTOR: Well, just give me a report on all damaged parts. "
82,"K9: No damage, master. "
83,"DOCTOR: What? What, none? "
84,"K9: All component parts are functioning normally, master. "
85,DOCTOR: I don't believe it. I don't believe it! All component parts
86,"functioning normally, ha! Pah. You mean to tell me that after all we've"
87,"been through, the systems are functioning perfectly? "
88,"K9: Not perfectly, Master, adverb attributed was normally. "
89,ROMANA: Doctor. 
90,DOCTOR: Hmm? 
91,ROMANA: We've materialised. 
92,"DOCTOR: Indeed we have. Let's take a look, shall we? "
93,(The scanner shows a plain brown landscape.) 
94,"DOCTOR: Oh, yes. The wilderness of outer Gallifrey. Ready to go? "
95,ROMANA: I suppose so. 
96,"DOCTOR: Come on, it's not the end of the universe. We're home. "
97,ROMANA: Sorry. 
98,"DOCTOR: Oh please, don't keep apologising. Try and brighten up. "
99,"(The Doctor goes outside, and Romana heads for her room.) "
100,DOCTOR : Romana!
101,
102, [Forest clearing]
103,
104,(This is not the landscape on the scanner. Romana
105,comes out of the Tardis.) 
106,DOCTOR: Romana! This isn't Gallifrey. 
107,(The Doctor sits on a fallen tree trunk.) 
108,ROMANA: It certainly isn't. 
109,"(Birds fly up behind the Doctor, making him jump.)"
110,
111, [By the lake]
112,
113,(Two men are skinny dipping in the lake whilst
114,their fellows gather large melon-like fruits into wicker boxes. A group
115,of teenagers sneak in and start helping themselves to fruit piled up
116,nearby. The workers are not amused.) 
117,OMRIL: Hey! Get them! 
118,(The teenagers scatter into the forest and the men follow.) 
119, [Forest] 
120," OMRIL: No sign of them. Well, at least they got no"
121,river fruits. 
122,RYSIK: I suppose that's something. 
123,OMRIL: Let's go. 
124,(The pursuers leave.) 
125,VARSH: That was close. 
126,"TYLOS: Easy, Varsh. You said it would be easy. "
127,"VARSH: All right, Tylos "
128,TYLOS: It's not all right. 
129,KEARA: Look. Down there. 
130,(Two older men are walking through the fruit gathers.) 
131,TYLOS: Decider Draith. And Dexeter. What are they doing here? 
132, [By the lake] 
133, (The clean shaven younger man puts a large box on
134,a table and opens it. He selects one of the river fruit and splits it
135,in half with a machete.) 
136,"DEXETER: Yes, there seems to be a trace. Just a trace."
137,
138, [Tardis]
139,
140,(The Doctor looks at the image on the scanner.) 
141,DOCTOR: That is Gallifrey. That is Gallifrey. 
142,"K9: Coordinates are correct, master. "
143,ROMANA: Ten zero eleven zero zero by zero two. K9 is right. 
144,DOCTOR: But it's absurd. It's just absurd. 
145,K9: Master. 
146,ROMANA: What are we going to do? 
147,"DOCTOR: Well, we can't take off until we find out precisely what's"
148,wrong with the Tardis. 
149,(The Doctor ducks underneath the console.) 
150,"ROMANA: Doctor, the last time you tried that "
151,"DOCTOR: Practice, practice "
152,(Bang and flash! Smoke comes from the pedastal. ) 
153, [By the lake]
154,
155,(Dexeter is using tweezers to examine the 'seeds'
156,of the river plants.) 
157,DRAITH: They seem to be moving. 
158,DEXETER: It's the same sign noted fifty years ago by Corellis and Dell.
159,They postulated that they might be eggs of some kind. 
160,DRAITH: Insect eggs? 
161,DEXETER: Perhaps. Unfamiliar insect life is supposed to precede each
162,incident. 
163,"DRAITH: Yes, it's true. "
164,DEXETER: Can you confirm this? Is it mentioned in the System Files? 
165,"DRAITH: You overreach yourself, Dexeter. "
166,"DEXETER: Forgive me, Decider, but if there is some way we can let"
167,"science illuminate your inner knowledge, you "
168,DRAITH: I cannot discuss the System Files. Sometimes I wish I could
169,"share it with someone, but I too must obey the Procedure. "
170,"DEXETER: Of course, Decider."
171,
172, [Outler's cave]
173,
174,(Tylos is sharpening his knife on a stone. The
175,"teenagers have a visitor, another young lad. Everyone say Hi to Matthew"
176,Waterhouse.) 
177,"VARSH: So, you want to be an Outler. "
178,ADRIC: I'm serious. 
179,TYLOS: Nobody joins unless we all agree. 
180,"VARSH: You belong in the Starliner, Adric. "
181,KEARA: Ask him the Embarkation Question. 
182,"TYLOS: Yes, go on. "
183,"VARSH: When the Starliner leaves Alzarius, were will you be? "
184,ADRIC: Not here. 
185,TYLOS: You see? 
186,KEARA: He'll be in the Starliner. 
187,TYLOS: If it ever does take off. 
188,ADRIC: It will! 
189,TYLOS: He believes all that stuff 
190,ADRIC: It will take off. But I won't be on it. 
191,KEARA: And you won't be on Alzarius either? 
192,ADRIC: I don't know. I'll be somewhere else. 
193,TYLOS: Daydreamer. 
194,"ADRIC: I'm sorry, I just can't explain. "
195,KEARA: He belongs in the Great Hall of Books with all the other
196,dreamers. 
197,"TYLOS: Anyway, we said no Elites. Unless you want to make special rules"
198,for your brother? 
199,VARSH: We've broken all family ties. 
200,ADRIC: But I don't expect special treatment. 
201,KEARA: Don't you? Isn't that what the star's for? 
202,(The blue star on Adric's jacket pocket.) 
203,ADRIC: That is for mathematical excellence. 
204,KEARA: So the boy can count. Give it to me. 
205,(Adric grabs Keara's arm and twists it behind her back.) ADRIC: Keep
206,your hands off it! 
207,KEARA: Let go! 
208,ADRIC: And don't tell me what to do. I've had enough orders in the
209,Starliner. Can't you keep these two under better control? 
210,KEARA: He talks like a Decider already. 
211,TYLOS: He's no better than we are. 
212,ADRIC: Of course I'm better than you. I'm an Elite. 
213,VARSH: That won't help you outside the Starliner when you're struggling
214,to stay alive. 
215,ADRIC: It's you people who talk like Deciders. 
216,KEARA: What? 
217,"ADRIC: I mean, you can't even steal a few river fruits. "
218,TYLOS: I'd like to see you try. 
219,ADRIC: All right. 
220,"VARSH: Go back to the Starliner, Adric. "
221,TYLOS: No. If your little brother really wants to prove himself 
222,VARSH: They'll be guarding the fruits now. It's too dangerous for us. 
223,TYLOS: We don't have badges for mathematical excellence. You know what
224,this is? 
225,"(Tylos holds up a piece of plaited twine, with decorations laced into"
226,it.) 
227,TYLOS: It's our badge. It has to be earned. 
228,ADRIC: Right.
229,
230, [Science unit]
231,
232,(Things are swimming around in a dish under the
233,microscope. Two more older men are there.) 
234,NEFRED: If this is Mistfall 
235,"DEXETER: I hope so, Decider Nefred. Scientifically. "
236,"GARIF: You're too young to remember the last one, Dexeter, but it's not"
237,something I look forward to. 
238,NEFRED: Nor I. 
239,"GARIF: Nor Decider Draith, I'm sure. "
240,DEXETER: Decider Draith. I must get back to him. 
241,NEFRED: I was a boy the last time the mists came. Horrible. Horrible. 
242,(The Deciders leave. Dexeter reads from a small notebook.) 
243,DEXETER: A kind of spider. Incomprehensible lifeform. Infectious.
244,
245, [By the lake]
246,
247,(Dexeter runs over to Draith.) 
248,OMRIL: Dexeter again. What's going on? 
249,RYSIK: I told you something was up. I told you. 
250,"(Meanwhile, the teenagers are watching from the forest as Adric swims"
251,across the lake. He reaches the shore by the stockpile of fruits and
252,creeps ashore. Then steam and bubbles start to form in the lake. The
253,adults gather to look. The Decider pushes through them.) 
254,DRAITH: Let me through. Make way. 
255,(The water seems to be almost boiling.) 
256,DRAITH: Indeed. Mistfall! 
257,(General consternation. The two swimmers start struggling in the
258,water.) 
259,SWIMMER: Help me! Help us! 
260,DRAITH: In the water! 
261,"OMRIL: Come on, let's get them. "
262,(The two men drag the swimmers out. They are actually wearing
263,loinclothes. Shame.) 
264,DRAITH: Citizens! Citizens. Citizens! As First Decider and Keeper of
265,"the System Files, I must announce to you the coming of Mistfall. "
266,(Everyone gasps in horror.) 
267,DRAITH: There is no need to be alarmed as long as you all follow the
268,Procedure. We have two hours. 
269,"(The people start to gather up their baskets and rugs, and leave. Adric"
270,sneaks over to the pile and picks up three fruits. He is spotted.) 
271,DRAITH: Adric! 
272,(Adric drops the fruits and runs. Draith gives chase.) 
273,"DEXETER: Decider, come back! They're not worth it! "
274, [Forest] 
275, VARSH: Split up. We'll meet back at the cave. 
276,(Draith spots Adric running through the ferns and moves to cut him off
277,by the shore.) 
278, [By the lake] 
279, (Adric's foot sinks in deep mud and he falls
280,amonst the mist. Draith goes up help to him.) 
281,"DRAITH: Adric! Come on, they're closing the Starliner. Come on. "
282,(Draith pulls Adric to his feet.) 
283,"DRAITH: Come on, come on. "
284,ADRIC: Leave me alone. 
285,"(Adric ducks between Draith's legs, knocking him backwards into the mud"
286,where he lies motionless.)
287,
288, [Starliner reception]
289,
290,"(The people return to a large, shiny purple"
291,spaceship standing taller than the few surrounding trees. It's
292,construction is almost crystalline. They go inside and check in at the
293,reception desk. Knives have to be left here.) 
294,LOGIN: Have you seen my daughter? Have you seen any of the Outlers? 
295,"(Everyone say Hi to George Baker, before Inspector Wexford.) "
296,"MAN 3: No, no. "
297,(He goes to the check-in desk.) 
298,LOGIN: Is there been any news. 
299,(The man there shakes his head. The Deciders approach.) 
300,NEFRED: Citizen Login. What is it? 
301,"LOGIN: Sirs, forgive me. "
302,GARIF: Your daughter? 
303,"LOGIN: She's out there, unprotected. Is there nothing we can do? "
304,"NEFRED: She and the other Outlers chose to leave us, Login. "
305,GARIF: The doors must close. 
306,"LOGIN: But Keara, she's so young. "
307,"NEFRED: And you, Login, are a greatly valued citizen, but we cannot"
308,change the law for you. 
309,GARIF: Not even for Decider Draith. He too has only one hour in which
310,to return.
311,
312, [By the lake]
313,
314, ADRIC: Decider! Decider Draith! 
315,(Something starts to pull Draith into the water. Adric isn't strong
316,enough to help.) 
317,DRAITH: Tell Dexeter we've come full circle 
318,(Draith disappears into the bubbling muddy water.)
319,
320, [Starliner reception]
321,
322, NEFRED: Time to start up the siren. 
323,(The final stragglers arrive.) 
324,NEFRED: Still no sign of Decider Draith. 
325,"GARIF: When those doors close, you will be First Decider. "
326,NEFRED: And we shall need a third. 
327, [Tardis]
328,
329,"(Adric runs through the forest, and comes across a"
330,"clearing with a strange blue box parked in it. Inside, Romana hears"
331,hammering.) 
332,ROMANA: What was that noise? 
333,DOCTOR: What? 
334,ROMANA: I thought I heard a noise. 
335,(She opens the door.) 
336,"DOCTOR: Well, of course you heard a noise. "
337,"(The Doctor resumes his work under the console, then slowly stands up"
338,again.) 
339,DOCTOR: Who are you? 
340,(Adric passes out.)
341,
342, [Outler's cave]
343,
344,(The three teenagers run in as the siren echoes.) 
345,VARSH: No! 
346,"KEARA: We saw it, Varsh. "
347,VARSH: Anything could make that water bubble. It could be anything! 
348,KEARA: It could be Mistfall. 
349,VARSH: Mistfall's a myth! 
350,TYLOS: The others don't think so. I saw them heading back to the
351,Starliner. 
352,VARSH: Deserters! 
353,KEARA: It's just us now. 
354,VARSH: And Adric. Don't let the Deciders fool you. They've taken these
355,things and twisted them to their own advantage. 
356,"TYLOS: Well, you'd better be right, or else we're dead."
357,
358, [Romana's room]
359,
360,(Adric is on Romana's bed as the Doctor tends to an
361,injury on his right knee.) 
362,ADRIC: I've got to warn them. 
363,DOCTOR: What? 
364,ADRIC: Mistfall. 
365,DOCTOR: Mistfall? 
366,ADRIC: My brother says it's a myth. The Outlers all think the Deciders
367,are lying. But I've seen it. 
368,DOCTOR: Mistfall?
369,
370, [Starliner reception]
371,
372,(A man runs inside.) 
373,GARIF: The internment may be a long one. Ten years perhaps until we
374,step onto the surface again. 
375,NEFRED: Decider Draith is too late. Seal the doors. 
376,(The final person runs in.) 
377,LOGIN: Have you seen Keara or Tylos? 
378,(The outer door comes down.) 
379,LOGIN: No! There are others out there. My daughter! My daughter. 
380,NEFRED: The air out there cannot support life. We have to seal the
381,"doors. We need all our strength, Citizen Login. "
382,LOGIN: You're quite right. We must redouble our effort toward the
383,Embarkation. 
384,"NEFRED: A fine spirit. Yes, our work must continue. "
385,GARIF: Our first task must be to choose a new Decider. 
386,"LOGIN: Yes, of course. "
387,NEFRED: We thought of seeking your advice on the matter. 
388, [Tardis]
389,
390, DOCTOR: Wrong place at the wrong time. 
391,ROMANA: Again. 
392,DOCTOR: What? 
393,ROMANA: Sounds like a type D oligarchy. Typical use of propaganda. He
394,"could have been hallucinating. A folk tale, a myth. "
395,ADRIC: That blue box I saw. I saw a blue box. 
396,DOCTOR: A blue box. Really? What was it like? 
397,"ADRIC: Well it was old. And there was a door. No, there were two doors,"
398,and they opened inwards. And there was something funny about them.
399,Handles weren't on the same level. 
400,DOCTOR: Quite right. We're inside it. It's called a Tardis. This boy's
401,not hallucinating. How's your transcendental dimensionalism? Never mind
402,"about that. Come on, K9. "
403,ROMANA: Where are you going? 
404,"DOCTOR: Well, to the marsh. We can't stand around here theorising. The"
405,boy convinces me. 
406,"ROMANA: Yes, but we still haven't worked out what's wrong with this. "
407,DOCTOR: What's wrong with what? 
408,"ROMANA: Oh, the console, the scanner. "
409,"DOCTOR: Oh, that. Yes, that recurring image of Gallifrey. Well, it's"
410,something really quite simple. The image translator reads the absolute
411,values of the coordinates. 
412,ROMANA: Of course it does. Real space doesn't have (penny drops)
413,"negative coordinates. Doctor, that disruption we came through. "
414,"DOCTOR: Well, it's just a thought. "
415,ROMANA: It's a very nasty thought. That would mean that we're out of
416,real space altogether.
417,
418, [By the lake]
419,
420," DOCTOR: What do you make of this fog, K9? "
421,K9: Unfamiliar composition. Initial analysis indicates non-toxic. 
422,DOCTOR: Non-toxic?
423,
424, [Tardis]
425,
426,(Romana is making notes.) 
427,ADRIC: I must go back and warn the others. 
428,"ROMANA: Fifteen, four, two. Er, you'd better take this. "
429,"(She hands him a little sphere, which beeps.) "
430,"ADRIC: Oh, a homing device. "
431,ROMANA: Yes. It'll help you find your way back to the Tardis. How's the
432,knee? 
433,ADRIC: Healed. 
434,ROMANA: Adric. 
435,(Adric removes the plaster to reveal clean skin through the bloodied
436,hole in his trousers.)
437,
438, [By the lake]
439,
440,(The mist is getting thicker.) 
441,"K9: Master, alert. "
442,(Bipedal amphibians rise from the water and make their way towards
443,land.) 
444, Part Two
445,
446, [By the lake]
447,
448,"(Once the amphibians make it onto solid ground,"
449,"they stop, gasping.) "
450,"DOCTOR: They've stopped moving, K9. "
451,K9: The observation is correct. 
452,"DOCTOR: Come on, let's get out of sight. "
453,"K9: Slow movement is advised, master. "
454, [Outler's cave]
455,
456, VARSH: Decider Draith is dead? 
457,"TYLOS: Well, leader? "
458,"VARSH: All right, all right, maybe I was wrong. You'd better not be"
459,"lying, Adric. "
460,ADRIC: The Doctor believed me. 
461,TYLOS: He is lying. 
462,"ADRIC: No, I'm not. Look. They gave me that. "
463,(Tylos takes it and sneers.) 
464,ADRIC: It's a homing device for locating the Tardis. 
465,(It beeps. Keara runs in.) 
466,KEARA: They've sealed the Starliner. 
467,TYLOS: The mist is getting thicker. 
468,VARSH: The Tardis. 
469,ADRIC: No. 
470,KEARA: We can't stay here. 
471,"VARSH: Why not the Tardis, Adric? "
472,ADRIC: It's too small. 
473,TYLOS: That's not what you told us. 
474,KEARA: You said it was huge 
475,"ADRIC: Well, I can't remember where it is. "
476,(Tylos holds up the beeping homer.) 
477, [Forest]
478,
479,(The Doctor and K9 hide in undergrowth as the
480,"amphibians stagger slowly past through the muddy, misty ground.) "
481,"DOCTOR: It's as if they're trying to acclimatise, which they seem to be"
482,"doing rather quickly. Follow them, K9. "
483,K9: Master. 
484,DOCTOR: Let me know where they settle. 
485,(K9 goes off as a final smaller amphibian comes out of the lake. The
486,Doctor encounters it in the forest.) 
487,DOCTOR: Hello? 
488,(It runs off.) 
489,DOCTOR: Oh. How odd. I usually get on terribly well with children.
490,

1436,LOGIN: As much as you want. We have an electrolytic power system 
1437,DOCTOR: Which will actually make the stuff? 
1438,LOGIN: Yes. 
1439,DOCTOR: Splendid. Enough to fill the whole starliner? 
1440,"LOGIN: Well, I'll see what I can do. "
1441,KEARA: He saved our lives. You'd better keep this for him.(She gives Adric Varsh's plaited belt.)

1448,
1449, GARIF: We've got to kill them. Kill them! 
1450,"DOCTOR: No. No, I think we should let them go. "
1451,GARIF: What? 
1452,DOCTOR: Look! They adapted quickly. 
1453,GARIF: They'll learn to breath the air. 
1454,DOCTOR: Yes. 
1455,GARIF: They might break into the ship and wipe out the crew. 
1456,DOCTOR: Yes. Still the manuals in the great book room will show them
1457,how to put it all together again. 
1458,GARIF: They could learn to read? 
1459,DOCTOR: Yes. Just like they did forty thousand generations ago. They're your
1460,ancestors. 
1461,LOGIN: Nefred's dying words. That's why we can't return to Terradon. 
1462,GARIF: It's horrible! 
1463,"DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think so. We're all basically primeval slime with"
1464,ideas above its station. 
1465,"GARIF: How can you compare us to those, those things? "
1466,"DOCTOR: Yes, I see what you mean. I suppose they are adaptive,"
1467,intelligent. 
1468,"GARIF: Login, shut the door. They've gone. "
1469,LOGIN: But how long for? 
1470,GARIF: What? 
1471,LOGIN: They've learned to get out. 
1472,"GARIF: Well, quite. Will they learn to come in?"
1473,
1474, [Starliner reception]
1475,
1476, LOGIN: So the first marsh men came to resemble the
1477,original crew of the starliner. 
1478,DOCTOR: Yes. The creatures most willing to survive in it. 
1479,GARIF: Terradonians. We are not Terradonians. 
1480,"DOCTOR: I know you're not Terradonians. You're not marsh men either,"
1481,are you? Which is what they seem to resent. 
1482,GARIF: I'm afraid they'll return. If they re-enter the ship 
1483,"LOGIN: We must do what Nefred said. Doctor, you must fly the starliner."
1484,You must fly us out of here. 
1485,"DOCTOR: What? You mean, fly you to Terradon? "
1486,LOGIN: Or any other suitable planet. 
1487,"GARIF: Well, certainly. This is a colony ship. We can program it to"
1488,find them. 
1489,"ROMANA: If they stay here, generations of evolution may be wiped out. "
1490,"LOGIN: Please, Doctor, it's our whole future."
1491,
1492, [Great Book Room]
1493,
1494, DOCTOR: Stabiliser. Power Fuel. 
1495,"GARIF: The system files, Doctor. "
1496,DOCTOR: Good. 
1497,"LOGIN: And this is the flight manual. I've heard of it, but I've never"
1498,seen it. 
1499,GARIF: The pages referring to takeoff were damaged in the crash. 
1500,"DOCTOR: Shhh. Ready? Thrusters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. "
1501,ROMANA: Ground hold disengage. 
1502,DOCTOR: Got it. 
1503,ROMANA: Then it's just ignition. 
1504,"DOCTOR: Which is that button there, gentlemen. "
1505,ROMANA: The manual is readable from there on. 
1506,DOCTOR: Have a good flight gentleman! 
1507,GARIF: Doctor! 
1508,LOGIN: You don't want us to take off on our own? 
1509,"GARIF: Doctor, come back! "
1510,DOCTOR: The green button gentleman! 
1511,GARIF: Such a momentous decision! 
1512,LOGIN: We must do what Nefred said. 
1513,"GARIF: I see his point, but on the other hand "
1514,"LOGIN: Garif, we must live up to our names. We must make this decision"
1515,together. 
1516,GARIF: But you will agree. It does require some thought.
1517,
1518, [Tardis]
1519,
1520," DOCTOR: They asked me to stay on you know, become"
1521,a Decider. 
1522,"ROMANA: You, a Decider? "
1523,DOCTOR: Yes. I decided not too. 
1524,"ROMANA: Doctor, what did happen while I was unconscious? "
1525,"DOCTOR: Oh, Adric and I were too busy to think about you. "
1526,ROMANA: Hmm. Adric's left us a present. 
1527,DOCTOR: Really? An Image Translator! Loot! He stole that. Still It
1528,might come in useful. 
1529,ROMANA: It works! 
1530,DOCTOR: Yes unfortunately. 
1531,ROMANA: Negative coordinates. 
1532,"DOCTOR: Yes that settles it. We're out of our own time and space,"
1533,Romana. 
1534,ROMANA: Exo-space? 
1535,DOCTOR: Yes. What I think we came through was a Charged Vacuum
1536,Emboitment. 
1537,ROMANA: A CVE. 
1538,DOCTOR Hmmm. One of the rarest Space-Time events in the universe. 
1539,"ROMANA: Doctor, look. The Starliner is taking off. "
1540,"DOCTOR: Well, they made a decision. "
1541,ROMANA: And we're trapped. Unless we can find another CVE. 
1542,K9: Affirmative.
